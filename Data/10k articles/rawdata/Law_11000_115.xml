'''California Proposition 36''', the '''Substance Abuse and Crime Prevention Act of 2000''', was an [[initiative]] [[statute]] that permanently changed state law to allow qualifying [[defendant]]s convicted of non-violent [[drug possession]] offenses to receive a probationary [[sentence (law)|sentence]] in lieu of [[incarceration]]. As a condition of [[probation]] defendants are required to participate in and complete a licensed and/or certified community drug treatment program. If the defendant fails to complete this program or violates any other term or condition of their probation, then probation can be revoked and the defendant may be required to serve an additional sentence which may include incarceration.
The proposition was passed with 6,233,422 (60.86%) votes in favor and 4,009,508 (39.14%) against on November 7, 2000 and went into effect on July 1, 2001 with $120 million for treatment services allocated annually for five years. The act is codified in sections 1210 and 3063.1 of the [[California Penal Code]] and Division 10.8 of the [[California Health and Safety Code]].

}}

== Qualified Defendants ==
Not all defendants convicted of a non-violent drug possession offense are eligible for probation and treatment under Prop 36.  Subdivision (b) of section 1210.1 of the California Penal Code deems the following defendants ineligible for the program:

# Any defendant who has been incarcerated within the last five years for a serious or violent felony offense.
# Any defendant convicted in the same proceeding of a non-drug related misdemeanor or any felony.
# Any defendant who, during the commission of the offense, was in possession of a firearm.
# Any defendant who refuses treatment.
# Any defendant who has two separate drug related convictions, has participated in Prop 36 twice before, and who is found by the court by clear and convincing evidence to be unamenable to any and all forms of available drug treatment. In such cases the defendant shall be sentenced to 30 days in jail.

==Reform==
Former Governor [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]] was critical of Proposition 36 because many in the program fail to complete treatment. About 34 percent of drug offenders complete treatment. Schwarzenegger attempted to modify the proposition by enacting Senate Bill 1137. The bill would have given judges the power to sentence jail time for a brief period to drug offenders who relapsed. Proposition 36 supporters objected to the changes and an [[Alameda County, California|Alameda County]] court ordered an [[injunction]] on the reforms. Senate Bill 1137 did not go into effect.

==Criticism==

Prop 36 is not [[Ex post facto law|retroactive]], meaning that defendants who had to attend unlicensed drug rehabs prior to Prop 36 and the Drug Courts are not afforded the opportunity to have their cases reheard in [[court]].  Prop 36 and the Drug Courts have discontinued the use of unlicensed rehabs as sentencing tools, due to concerns that unlicensed treatment could be unethical.  Many drug offenders who had used use unlicensed rehabs had been abused and are unable to appeal past convictions due to the formation of the Drug Courts. Unlicensed rehabs are no longer used, but people who relied on them are not afforded any of Prop 36's protection. If Prop 36's benefits had been extended retroactively, these people would have received them; at present, they do not.

==Evaluation==

The [[University of California, Los Angeles]], which was chosen to run the required evaluation of Proposition 36, has issued three annual reports on the implementation and impact of the program since 2003. These reports provide data and analysis that help state legislators determine the future of the program each year.
A UCLA study released in April 2006 showed Proposition 36 is saving taxpayers $2.50 for every $1 invested. According to the [[Drug Policy Alliance]], total savings for taxpayers over the past five years total $1.4 billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.prop36.org/pr040606.html|title=Prop 36 saved California $1.4 billion in first five years|publisher=Prop36.org|access-date=2007-03-04|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070926213448/http://www.prop36.org/pr040606.html#|archive-date=2007-09-26|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author1=Jason Ziedenberg |author2=Rose Braz|url=http://www.signonsandiego.com/uniontrib/20060417/news_mz1e17zieden.html|title=Saving money and aiding drug users|publisher=[[The San Diego Union-Tribune]]|date=2006-04-17|accessdate=2007-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another UCLA study found that convicted drug users had become more likely to be arrested on new drug charges since the proposition took effect

'''Arthur Louis Hugo Rudolph''' (November 9, 1906 – January 1, 1996) was a German rocket engineer who was a leader of the effort to develop the [[V-2 rocket]] for [[Nazi Germany]]. After World War II, the [[United States Government]]'s [[Office of Strategic Services]] (OSS) brought him to the U.S. as part of the clandestine [[Operation Paperclip]], where he became one of the main developers of the U.S. space program. He worked within the [[U.S. Army]] and [[NASA]], where he managed the development of several systems, including the [[Pershing missile]] and the [[Saturn V]] Moon rocket. In 1984, the [[U.S. Government]] investigated him for [[war crimes]], and he agreed to [[relinquishment of United States nationality|renounce his United States citizenship]] and leave the U.S. in return for not being prosecuted.{{r|independent1996}}

==Early life==
Rudolph was born in Stepfershausen, [[Meiningen]], Germany in 1906. His family were farmers, with a long tradition in the area. His father Gustav, died in 1915 while serving in [[World War I]]. Arthur and his younger brother Walter were raised by their mother, Ida. When Ida noticed young Arthur had a mechanical gift, she decided he should attend technical training. Walter inherited the family farm. From 1921 on, Rudolph attended the technical school{{r|techschool|group=Note}} in [[Schmalkalden]] for three years. In 1924 he found employment at a silver goods factory in [[Bremen]].

==Initial work on rocket engines==
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 102-11530, Heylandt-Werke, Raketenfahrzeug auf Prüfstand.jpg|thumb|left|Rocket vehicle on dynamometer at [[Heylandt]]]]

In August 1927 Rudolph accepted a job at Stock &amp; Co. in [[Berlin]]. After a few months, he became a toolmaker at Fritz Werner. In 1928 he attended the Technical College of Berlin— now the [[Technical University of Berlin]]&amp;nbsp;—graduating in 1930 with the equivalent of a [[Bachelor of Science]] degree in [[mechanical engineering]]. On May 1, 1930, Rudolph began working for the Heylandt Works in Berlin where he met rocketry pioneer [[Max Valier]].{{r|neufeld2|page=54}}{{r|heylandt|group=Note}} Valier had use of the factory grounds for his experiments in rocketry and Rudolph became interested, working with Valier in his spare time along with [[Walter Riedel]]. Rudolph already had some interest in rocketry, having read ''Wege zur Raumschiffahrt'' (''Ways to Spaceflight'') by [[Hermann Oberth]] and having seen the film ''[[Woman in the Moon]]''.

On May 17, an experimental engine exploded and killed Valier. Dr. Paulus Heylandt forbade further rocket research, but Rudolph continued secretly with Riedel and Alfons Pietsch. Rudolph then developed an improved and safer version of Valier's engine while Pietsch designed a rocket car. Dr. Heylandt conceded to back the project, and the "Heylandt Rocket Car" was born and was exhibited at [[Berlin Tempelhof Airport|Tempelhof Aerodrome]]. While it was a technical success, the fuel costs were greater than the admissions received and performances were discontinued. Rudolph joined the [[Nazi Party]] in 1931, then later the [[Sturmabteilung|SA]].{{r|franklin|page=38}}

Rudolph first met [[Wernher von Braun]] when he visited a meeting of the ''[[Verein für Raumschiffahrt]]'' (VfR, the "Spaceflight Society"). In May 1932 Rudolph was laid off and looking for work when he encountered Pietsch. After forming a partnership Rudolph began design on a new engine, while Pietsch looked for a backer. Pietsch met with [[Walter Dornberger]], who had been tasked by the German Ordnance Department to develop a rocket weapons system and had become interested in the VfR.

After demonstrating the new engine to Dornberger, Rudolph moved to the proving grounds at [[Kummersdorf]] along with Riedel, and began working under von Braun. Rudolph's engine was used in the [[Aggregat (rocket family)|Aggregat]] series of rockets. In December 1934, the von Braun team successfully launched two A-2 rockets from the island of [[Borkum]]. Static testing on the A-3 engines began in Kummersdorf in late 1936 and were observed by General [[Werner von Fritsch]], the commander-in chief of the [[Oberkommando des Heeres|German Army High Command]].

The Kummersdorf facilities were inadequate for continued operations, so the von Braun team was moved to [[Peenemünde]] in May 1937 where Rudolph was tasked with the building of the A-3 test stand. The Rudolphs lived in nearby [[Zinnowitz]], where their daughter, Marianne Erika, was born on November 26, 1937. The A-3 series was plagued with guidance problems and never proved successful. In early 1938, Dornberger put Rudolph in charge of the design for the new production plant to be built at Peenemünde for the A-4 series, later renamed the [[V-2 rocket|V-2]] ([[Vergeltungswaffe]]-''Reprisal Weapon''-2).

==World War II==
In August 1943, as Rudolph was ready to begin production of the V-2, the British [[Bombing of Peenemünde in World War II|bombed Peenemünde]]. After Peenemünde was bombed, the V-2 production facility was moved to the [[Mittelwerk]] facility, which was near [[Nordhausen]] and underground.

Mittelwerk was originally a gypsum mine that was being used as a storage facility and was being excavated for production facilities. The labor force consisted of prisoners who were eventually housed at the [[Mittelbau-Dora]] [[Internment|concentration camp]]. Rudolph was in charge of moving the equipment from Peenemünde to Mittelwerk, working under Albin Sawatzki. After the plant was in place, Rudolph was operations director for V-2 missile production.{{r|hunt|page=16}} Sawatzki decreed that fifty were to be produced in December. Given the labor and parts issues, Rudolph was barely able to produce four rockets that were later returned from Peenemünde as defective. There are estimates that between 12–20,000 prisoners died while building the V-2 rockets at Mittelwerk. More than the actual V-2 bombardments.&lt;ref name=neufeld3/&gt;{{Failed verification|date=November 2018|The source document does not discuss the number of prisoners who died due to production}}

In 1944, [[Heinrich Himmler|Himmler]] convinced [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]] to put the V-2 project directly under [[Schutzstaffel|SS]] control, and in August replaced Dornberger with SS General [[Hans Kammler]] as its director.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

In January 1945 the SS ordered all of the civilians and prisoners, including Rudolph and his team, to attend a public hanging of six to twelve prisoners accused of [[sabotage]]. By March 1945, production had stopped due to a lack of parts and Rudolph and his staff were moved to [[Oberammergau]] where they met von Braun and others from Peenemünde. They finally surrendered to the U.S. Army and were transported to [[Garmisch-Partenkirchen|Garmisch]].

==Recruitment into services of Allied powers and move to United States==
{{Project Paperclip Team at Fort Bliss|Rudolph is in the front row, fourth from the left.}}
Rudolph was transferred to the British to participate in [[Operation Backfire (WWII)|Operation Backfire]] from July to October 1945. {{r|franklin|page=99}} He was then transferred back to the Americans. The U.S. Army picked up Martha and Marianne Rudolph from Stepfershausen before it was occupied by the [[Red Army]] and the Rudolphs were reunited at Camp Overcast near [[Landshut]].{{r|franklin|page=101}} In November 1945, Operation Overcast brought Rudolph, von Braun and the rest of the [[List of German rocket scientists in the United States|V-2 team]] temporarily to the US for six months. Overcast was renamed [[Operation Paperclip]] in March 1946 and formally approved by President [[Harry S. Truman|Truman]] in August 1946. Most of the group stayed permanently. During a background investigation conducted on January 2, 1954 Rudolph was described as "a loyal member of the National Socialist German Labor Party (NSDAP), and is the type of person who would not stop at anything if it might further his ambitions. He had the reputation of being a person who, in his enthusiasm for the Nazi Regime, could be dangerous to a fellow employee who did not guard his language." Despite this less than enthusiastic review Rudolph was placed in a position of trust and confidence.&lt;ref name=foia /&gt;{{Failed verification|date=December 2016|reason=The preceding statements are not found in the FBI documents}}

After a brief interrogation at [[Fort Strong]], the team was sent to [[White Sands Missile Range|White Sands Proving Grounds]] to work on further V-2 engineering in January 1946. In January 1947 Rudolph was moved to the [[Army Ballistic Missile Agency|Ordnance Research and Development Division]] at [[Fort Bliss]], [[El Paso, Texas]], where his family finally joined him in April. Since he had been brought into the US without a visa, he and others were sent to [[Ciudad Juárez|Juárez]], Mexico where he obtained a visa and officially immigrated to the U.S. on April 14, 1949. During his time at Fort Bliss, he acted as a liaison to the Solar Aircraft Company,{{r|solar|group=Note}} and spent much of 1947 and 1949 in San Diego, California.

During a 1949 inquiry by the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]], Rudolph made the following statement on his participation in the Nazi party:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Until 1930 I sympathized with the Social Democratic party, voted for it and was a member of a Social Democratic union (Bund Techn. Agst. u. Beamt.) After 1930 the economical situation became so serious that it appeared to me to be headed for catastrophe. (I really became unemployed in 1932.) The great amount of unemployment caused the expansion of National Socialist and Communist parties. Frightened that the latter one would become the government I joined the NSDAP (a legally reg. entity) to help, I believed in the preservation of western culture.{{r|foia}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

On June 25, 1950 Rudolph was transferred to [[Redstone Arsenal]], [[Huntsville, Alabama]], and his group was re-designated as the [[Army Ballistic Missile Agency|Ordnance Guided Missile Center]]. He was naturalized as an American citizen on November 11, 1954 in [[Birmingham, Alabama]]. In 1950 Rudolph was appointed as the technical director for the [[PGM-11 Redstone|Redstone missile]] project. Rudolph was assigned as the project manager for the [[Pershing missile]] project in 1956. He specifically selected [[Glenn L. Martin Company|The Martin Company]] as the prime contractor for the program. He also chose the [[Pioneer Instrument Company|Eclipse-Pioneer]] division of [[Bendix Corporation|Bendix]] to develop the guidance system after he personally inspected the plant in [[Teterboro, New Jersey]].

Rudolph received an honorary doctorate of science degree from [[Rollins College]] in [[Winter Park, Florida]] on February 23, 1959. He received the [[Department of the Army Decoration for Exceptional Civilian Service|Decoration for Exceptional Civilian Service]], the highest Army award for civilians, for his work on Pershing.{{r|freeman1993}}

==NASA==
[[Image:Apollo 4 Saturn V, s67-50531.jpg|thumb|upright|The first Saturn V, AS-501, before the launch of ''[[Apollo 4]]'']]Although von Braun and his team had been transferred to NASA in 1960, Rudolph stayed with [[Army Ballistic Missile Agency|ABMA]] to continue critical work on Pershing. In 1961 he finally moved to NASA, once again working for von Braun. He became the assistant director of systems engineering, serving as liaison between vehicle development at [[Marshall Space Flight Center]] and the [[Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center|Manned Spacecraft Center]] in Houston. He later became the project director of the [[Saturn V]] rocket program in August 1963. He developed the requirements for the rocket system and the mission plan for the [[Apollo program]]. The first Saturn V launch lifted off from [[Kennedy Space Center]] and performed flawlessly on November 9, 1967, Rudolph's birthday.{{r|nyt196711}} He was then assigned as the special assistant to the director of MSFC in May 1968 and subsequently retired from NASA on January 1, 1969.{{r|nyt19680515}} During his tenure he was awarded the [[NASA Exceptional Service Medal]] and the [[NASA Distinguished Service Medal]]. On July 16, 1969, the Saturn V launched [[Apollo 11]], putting man on the Moon.

==Denaturalization and departure to West Germany==
In 1979, [[Eli Rosenbaum]] of the [[Office of Special Investigations (United States Department of Justice)|Office of Special Investigations]] (OSI) by chance read about Rudolph in a book about moving rocket parts using forced labor.{{r|feigin}} Eli Rosenbaum had conducted research at the [[National Archives and Records Administration|National Archives]], about the [[Mittelbau-Dora#Andrae Trial|Dora war crimes trial]], appearing to connect him with the use of [[forced labor]] at [[Mittelwerk]].{{r|newburger2002}}
In September 1982, Rudolph received a letter requesting an interview by the OSI.{{r|newburger2002}}
Rudolph believed this was one of the series of interrogations he had gone through since his arrival in the U.S. The first of three interviews, it centered on his attitudes on racial superiority, his early participation in the Nazi Party and a possible role in the treatment of prisoners at Mittelwerk.

On November 28, 1983, Rudolph, purportedly under duress and fearful for the welfare of his wife and daughter, signed an agreement with the OSI stating that he would leave the United States and renounce his United States citizenship. Under the agreement, Rudolph would not be prosecuted, the citizenship of his wife and daughter was not in danger of revocation and Rudolph's retirement and [[Social Security (United States)|Social Security]] benefits were left intact. In March 1984 Arthur and Martha Rudolph departed for West Germany where Rudolph renounced his citizenship as agreed. West Germany protested to the [[United States Department of State]], as Rudolph now had no citizenship in any country. In July, West Germany requested documentation from the OSI to determine if Rudolph should be prosecuted or granted citizenship. The [[World Jewish Congress]] placed articles in newspapers in January 1985 on behalf of the Department of Justice, searching for survivors of the Mittelwerk.{{r|israelite}}

After receiving documentation in April 1985, the case was investigated by Harald Duhn, the Attorney General of [[Hamburg]]. In March 1987, the investigation concluded after questioning a number of witnesses and determining no basis for prosecution, since the only crime which had not passed the statute of limitations was murder. Rudolph was granted German citizenship.{{r|nyt19900806}}

Meanwhile, a great deal of controversy occurred back in the U.S. Rudolph had not told his friends of the investigation, but the OSI issued a press release after his departure.{{r|neufeld}} Several groups and individuals were calling for an investigation into the OSI's activities regarding Rudolph. These included retired Major General [[John Bruce Medaris|John Medaris]] (former commander of ABMA), officials of the city of Huntsville, the [[American Legion]] and former associates at NASA. Thomas Franklin interviewed Rudolph and wrote a series of articles in the ''Huntsville News'' that questioned the OSI investigation– these were later used as the basis for ''An American in Exile: The Story of Arthur Rudolph''.{{r|franklin}}{{r|mcinnish|group=Note}}

In 1985, [[United States House of Representatives|Representative]] [[S. William Green|Bill Green]] of New York introduced a bill to strip Rudolph of the NASA Distinguished Service Medal (DSM) and re-introduced it in 1987.{{r|green1|green2}} Rudolph applied for a visa in 1989 to attend a 20th anniversary celebration of the first Moon landing, but was denied by the State Department. In May 1990, Representative [[James Traficant]] of Ohio submitted a motion calling for hearings to determine whether the OSI was "justified in its actions or violated the rights of Arthur Rudolph."{{r|laney}} The motion failed to receive any co-sponsors and was referred to the [[United States House Judiciary Subcommittee on Immigration, Citizenship, Refugees, Border Security, and International Law|Subcommittee on Immigration, Refugees, and International Law]] in June, with no further action taken.{{r|traficant1|traficant2|nyt19900505}}

In July the Rudolphs entered Canada for a reunion with their daughter. Since the OSI had placed Rudolph on a watch list, he was detained and left Canada of his own accord.{{r|cbc19900606}} [[Ernst Zündel]] and [[Paul Fromm (activist)|Paul Fromm]] attempted to support Rudolph with demonstrations. After Rudolph left, an immigration hearing was held in his absence; he was represented by [[Barbara Kulaszka]], but Canadian authorities ruled that he could not return to Canada.{{r|macleod}} Rudolph sued to regain his U.S. citizenship, but the case was dismissed in 1993.{{r|nyt19930220}}

In November 1996, Martha Rudolph wrote to [[Henry Hyde]], then chairman of the [[United States House Committee on the Judiciary|House Judiciary Committee]]. She stated that her husband had signed the agreement after coercion and duress by the OSI and that she was dismayed by the House resolutions to strip her husband of the DSM. Rudolph continued to be defended by [[Pat Buchanan]], [[Lyndon LaRouche]] and [[Friedwardt Winterberg]].{{r|buchanan|king}} He was also defended by [[Holocaust denier]]s like Robert H. Countess and Martin Hollmann.{{r|laney}}

==Personal life==
{{unreferenced section|date=January 2017}}
Rudolph married Martha Therese Kohls (July 5, 1905 &amp;ndash; January 3, 1999) on October 3, 1935 in Berlin. Rudolph and his wife retired to [[San Jose, California]] to be near their daughter. Soon after moving back to Germany, he had a heart attack and a [[Coronary artery bypass surgery|triple bypass]]. Arthur Rudolph died in Hamburg on January 1, 1996 from heart failure.

==In popular culture==
{{in popular culture|section|date=September 2018}}
The character of Hans Udet in the novel ''[[Voyage (novel)|Voyage]]'' by [[Stephen Baxter (author)|Stephen Baxter]] is based on Rudolph.{{r|baxter}} Udet is described as a senior member of von Braun's V-2 team at the Mittelwerk and as the director of the Saturn V project. Near the end of the novel Udet faces charges on war crimes, renounces his citizenship and returns to Germany.

The character of Franz Bettmann in the film ''[[The Good German]]'', described as the chief production engineer of the V2, is in part based on Rudolph.  He is also the central character in the play "Some Brighter Distance" by Kevin Reddin.{{cn|date=September 2018}}

Rudolph was portrayed by Christopher Shaw in the stage play ''Apollo'', written by Nancy Keystone. ''Apollo'' premiered at Portland Center Stage in Portland, Oregon on January 13, 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://pacificresidenttheatre.com/christopher-shaw/|title=Pacific Resident Theater|website=Pacific Resident Theater|access-date=2018-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''national referendum''', the nation's first, was held in [[Belize]] on February 7, 2008, coinciding with the [[Belizean legislative election, 2008|2008 general elections]].

The question asked was: "Should the [[Senate of Belize]] be elected?"

== Background ==
{{Main|Senate of Belize}}
Ever since independence from Great Britain in 1981, Belize has had its upper house appointed. Currently, there are 12 senators and a President.

An elected Senate, according to its proponents, would return the decision over control of the nation's resources and development to the Belizean people.

== Discussion ==
Earlier in the year, Prime Minister [[Said Musa]] had given tacit support to the idea of an elected Senate, and eventually brought up the matter in session of the House of Representatives on December 19, 2007.

Musa introduced a bill to allow for a referendum, to be held in 2008 likely alongside the general elections, to determine Belizeans' thoughts on the issue. The Opposition, led by [[Dean Barrow]], argued against going to a referendum on the basis that Belizeans had not been given enough time for discussion of the issue and charged that the governing [[People's United Party]] was trying to hijack the issue to gain votes at the general elections due in the first half of 2008. The PUP countered that the opposition [[United Democratic Party (Belize)|United Democratic Party]] were on "the wrong side of history".

== Announcement of referendum and reaction ==
[[Prime Minister of Belize]] [[Said Musa]], on Monday January 7, 2008, announced that he had asked the Governor General, Sir [[Colville Young]], to issue a writ of referendum to be held the same day as the general election.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.channel5belize.com/archive_detail_story.php?story_id=19955{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} News 5, January 7, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; There is precedent for multiple voting in Belize: the [[Belizean legislative election, 2003|2003 elections for general]] and [[Belizean municipal election, 2003|municipal]] were held on the same day. In anticipation of the announcement the PUP had released ads condemning the UDP position and encouraging Belizeans to vote for them as well as to vote in favour of an elected Senate, linking the two together. The PUP released its proposal for an elected Senate on January 17.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.channel5belize.com/archive_detail_story.php?story_id=20038{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} News 5, January 17, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

The Opposition [[United Democratic Party (Belize)|UDP]] announced on January 8 that it had asked its supporters to either boycott the poll or vote "no".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.channel5belize.com/archive_detail_story.php?story_id=19964{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}. News 5, January 8, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; It trumpeted its alternate plan as a solution. Party leader Barrow amended the position later on by simply asking supporters to vote "no."

Reaction from the third parties was mixed. Even as many welcome the referendum, they are cautious about mixing it with the general election. Senator Godwin Hulse, Kevin Herrera and Henry Gordon of SPEAR have presented an alternate plan for the elected Senate as part of a list of reforms, to widespread discussion.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.channel5belize.com/archive_detail_story.php?story_id=19974{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} News 5, January 8, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

== Procedure ==
The referendum was held to the same procedures as a general election. All registered voters over 18 were eligible to participate. Separate places in the polling stations were provided for the referendum.

The voting for the referendum began at 7:00 AM CST (1300 UTC) on election day and finished at 6:00 PM CST (0000 UTC Friday). Counting of votes began at the various counting stations beginning after the counting of votes for the general elections and continuing until a simple majority was reached which declared support or dissent for the question.

== Results ==

The referendum passed with over 61 percent of the vote nationwide and won in 30 out of 31 [[Constituencies of Belize|constituencies]]. Only the [[Queen's Square (Belize House constituency)|Queen's Square]] constituency in [[Belize City]] voted against it.&lt;ref name="08refer"&gt;[http://www.elections.gov.bz/modules/wfdownloads/visit.php?cid=86&amp;lid=214 Referendum Results 2008], [[Belize Elections and Boundaries Commission]].

'''Bet Tzedek''' is an American non-profit human and [[welfare|poverty rights]] organization, internationally recognized for its work in providing unique advocacy and support for people living in poverty, and for communities victimized by discrimination and [[civil rights]] abuses.

One of the United States' leading centers for [[social justice]], Bet Tzedek is based in [[Los Angeles, California]]. It was founded in 1974 by a group of Jewish attorneys determined to address the human rights issues and humanitarian needs endemic to Los Angeles. Their social justice philosophy was rooted in a central tenet of Jewish law and teaching: "Tzedek, tzedek tirdof – Justice, justice you shall pursue."

Bet Tzedek embraces the fundamental commitment of achieving full and equal access to justice for all people. The United States legal system was created to fairly serve all citizens, yet without equal access to the justice system, low-income citizens are disproportionately victimized by unjust and illegal practices such as coercive labor practices, abuse and neglect of developmentally disabled people, unlawful debt collection and racially targeted victimization.

In a city with one of the highest poverty rates in the United States, Bet Tzedek offers support to the nearly two million residents of L.A. who live in poverty.  Bet Tzedek has taken on widespread systemic injustices taking place in nursing homes, slum housing, and garment factories — identifying and investigating the problems, and winning victories that have directly and measurably expanded equal access to justice for the poor, elderly and disabled.

Today, many of Bet Tzedek's initiatives are the only programs of their kind in existence. Its free legal representation helps low-income people of every race and religion in Los Angeles, and directly empowers people with knowledge and tools needed to protect their rights.

==History==
In the late 1960s and early 1970s, [[activists]] throughout the nation began to systemically address the roots of injustice by fighting poverty, disenfranchisement, and discrimination. The City of Los Angeles faced overwhelming crises with devastatingly entrenched areas of urban blight, deteriorating living conditions in slums and ghettos, and an increasingly disempowered population of low-income people.

Bet Tzedek's volunteer attorneys provided free legal representation to Angelenos who would never otherwise gain access to the justice system. As the need skyrocketed throughout the mid-1970s, Bet Tzedek rapidly evolved from a part-time, volunteer-run organization into a comprehensive, full-service center providing free legal aid to all of Los Angeles.

By 1977, Bet Tzedek’s lawyers had won several landmark cases that brought hope and empowerment to thousands of the most vulnerable citizens in the rapidly growing metropolis, including successfully blocking the illegal evictions of low-income elderly residents of Venice, California's Cadillac Hotel. Bet Tzedek's victory won health and safety renovations, and guaranteed the residents' right to remain in a for the rest of their lives, at their current low rents.   
  
In 1984, Bet Tzedek affirmed its growing reputation as the leading agency offering free services to Holocaust survivors by winning a landmark decision that provided vital support and justice to thousands of low-income, elderly Holocaust survivors.  The U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit ruled in favor of Felicia Grunfeder, a Bet Tzedek client and Holocaust survivor who had been denied disability benefits because she received a small survivors’ reparations payment.  After multiple appeals, the federal courts ruled that Holocaust reparations payments cannot preclude disability payments—state and federal legislation subsequently codified the decision.

Bet Tzedek provided emergency legal services during and in the aftermath of the [[1992 Los Angeles riots]], when four LAPD officers were acquitted in the beating of black motorist Rodney King.  The issues central to the riots – racial profiling, civil rights abuses, endemic poverty, poor housing conditions, and unemployment – were also central to Bet Tzedek's work. L.A. Mayor [[Tom Bradley (American politician)|Tom Bradley]] commended Bet Tzedek for providing services during and after [[civil unrest]]. Advocates continue to see clients at senior centers in the central city during the riots.

In the early 1990s, Bet Tzedek sued a national [[HMO]] alleging fraud and deceptive sales practices in the HMO’s racially targeted victimization of elderly Spanish-speaking enrollees. Ensuing media coverage prompted a federal investigation and a stockholder suit against the company and Bet Tzedek successfully settled the underlying case.

Following the [[1994 Northridge earthquake]], Bet Tzedek provided emergency assistance to earthquake victims with housing issues, home improvement fraud, and [[Federal Emergency Management Agency]] (FEMA) claims. For low-income victims, Bet Tzedek was the sole source of free advocacy.

In 1995, Bet Tzedek initiatives revealed disturbingly negligent conditions in Los Angeles area nursing homes. To address this, Bet Tzedek sponsored major state legislation that provided new standards and protections for low-income elderly residents who were most at risk for [[elder abuse]]. In 1999, Bet Tzedek's lawsuit against Hillhaven, one of the largest [[nursing home]] chains in the country, resulted in the company agreeing to change business practices that violate state and federal law and led to financial hardship for residents and their families.

In 1998, Bet Tzedek brought a major class-action suit with pro bono counsel against 16 European-based insurance companies who refused to honor insurance policies purchased by Jews who perished in [[the Holocaust]]. With up to 60% of all survivors living in poverty, this advocacy provided desperately needed resources. This advocacy continues to this day, as Bet Tzedek assists survivors with issues centered in the governments of former Nazi nations.

In 2001, when 61% of [[Los Angeles]] apparel contractors were violating wage and hour laws,&lt;ref name="anniversary"&gt;Lobaco, Gina. [http://www.bettzedek.org/PDF/annualreport2004.pdf Thirtieth Annual Report] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928002308/http://www.bettzedek.org/PDF/annualreport2004.pdf |date=September 28, 2007 }} (PDF). Bet Tzedek Legal Services. Retrieved on June 4, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Bet Tzedek opens the Employment Rights Project in the [[San Fernando Valley]] in response to the growing numbers of “[[working poor]]” in [[Los Angeles]], who remain in poverty despite working full-time as garment workers, day laborers, domestics, carwash employees, and gardeners.

In 2002, Bet Tzedek investigated the city’s most-convicted slumlord, unraveling a complex web of fraudulent practices. After filing a lawsuit, Bet Tzedek obtained a major settlement requiring the slumlord to pay $1 million to the City of L.A. and submit to ongoing monitoring of his business practices by Bet Tzedek.

In 2004, Bet Tzedek helped pass a new state law and established a new legal precedent protecting garment workers, ensuring the safety and proper treatment of hundreds of thousands of workers in L.A. alone.

In 2012, Bet Tzedek moved from its longtime headquarters in Los Angeles' historically Jewish [[Fairfax District, Los Angeles|Fairfax District]] to a new headquarters on [[Wilshire Boulevard]] in [[Koreatown, Los Angeles|Koreatown]].  The move was motivated in part because Bet Tzedek's services are now provided mainly to non-Jews, and because the organization desired a more centralized location.&lt;ref&gt;Nita Lelyveld, [http://www.latimes.com/news/local/la-me-bet-tzedek-20120909,0,2266061.story "Legal aid group Bet Tzedek graduates to new headquarters"], ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', September 9, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

Retrieved on June 4, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Housing===
The Housing Law Project provides legal assistance to tenants in Los Angeles County facing eviction actions and illegal housing conditions. The elderly and persons with disabilities are the focus of much of the service because they are often targeted for eviction in order to circumvent the rent stabilization laws and bring in new tenants at higher rents.

The lawsuit was later joined by the Los Angeles City Attorney's office, and the law firm of [[Gibson, Dunn &amp; Crutcher]] served as pro bono counsel on the suit. This case represented a landmark victory in the battle against [[landlords]] who subject their tenants to substandard health and safety conditions and set a significant precedent in the ability of tenants' groups to successfully prosecute owners attempting to hide behind a web of business identities.&lt;ref name="housing"&gt;[http://bettzedek.org/housingconditions.html Housing] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070521035049/http://bettzedek.org/housingconditions.html |date=May 21, 2007 }}.

Bet Tzedek’s Kinship Care Project is unique in Los Angeles County, as no other service provider focuses on this population. The assistance offered by Bet Tzedek Legal Services keeps children out of the [[foster care]] system, and ensures that all available government benefits are accessed, that health care is provided, and that rights to decent and safe housing are preserved. Additionally, Bet Tzedek Legal Services published Southern California’s first comprehensive guide for relative caregivers, Caring for a Relative’s Child.&lt;ref&gt;[http://bettzedek.org/PDF/kinshipcareguide.pdf Bettzedek.org] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928002115/http://bettzedek.org/PDF/kinshipcareguide.pdf |date=September 28, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The guide is available in both English and Spanish, and is the primary resource of its kind used by social workers throughout Los Angeles County.&lt;ref name="Kinship Care"/&gt;

===Nursing Home Advocacy Project===
The Nursing Home Advocacy Project (NHAP) has been a signature program that has shaped the development of Bet Tzedek’s nationally regarded elderlaw practice. The project was established in response to a critical need for effective legal assistance for frail, elderly residents of nursing homes.&lt;ref name="NursingHome"&gt;[http://www.bettzedek.org/nursinghome.html Nursing Home Advocacy Project] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070607231208/http://www.bettzedek.org/nursinghome.html |date=June 7, 2007 }}. Retrieved on June 5, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Today, Bet Tzedek aggressively works to improve the quality of care for the institutionalized elderly and provides legal protection against abuse and neglect through advice, education, advocacy, and litigation. Among the many milestones in NHAP’s history are:
* Comprehensive legislation to reform admissions and discharge practices and financial responsibility and billing practices by nursing homes.&lt;ref name="NursingHome"/&gt;
* A landmark study of Los Angeles County nursing homes, which brought to light serious noncompliance with state and federal regulations and prompted the passage of reform legislation 
* Major litigation against a national nursing home chain for fraudulent admissions contracts, resulting in sweeping national changes.

NHAP has published the following consumer guides: "The Nursing Home Companion" (in English and Spanish); "If Only I Had Known: Misrepresentations Made by Nursing Homes" (published with a grant from the Archstone Foundation), and "How to Get Care From a Residential Care Facility".&lt;ref&gt;[http://bettzedek.org/publications.html Bettzedek.org] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070407212416/http://bettzedek.org/publications.html |date=April 7, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Over 200,000 copies of these guides have been distributed nationally, and they remain the first resource consulted by ombudspersons throughout California.&lt;ref name="NursingHome"/&gt;

The '''Budget Responsibility and National Audit Act 2011''' (c. 4) is an [[Act of Parliament|Act]] of the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]].  It provides a statutory footing for the already-established [[Office for Budget Responsibility]], and requires the treasury to set out its approach to fiscal policy in a Charter for Budget Responsibility.  It also sets out a new structure for the [[National Audit Office (United Kingdom)|National Audit Office]] and repeals the [[Fiscal Responsibility Act 2010]].

It was introduced in the [[House of Lords]] by the [[Commercial Secretary to the Treasury]] [[James Sassoon, Baron Sassoon|Lord Sassoon]], on behalf of the [[Cameron–Clegg coalition|Government]], and it received [[Royal Assent]] on 22 March 2011.

== Office for Budget Responsibility ==

{{main article|Conscientious objector}}

A [[Conscientious Objector]] is an "individual who has refused to take part in the [[World War I|Great War]]".&lt;ref&gt;On 30 July 2001, explicit clarification of the [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]] Article 18 was made in the United Nations [[Human Rights Committee]] general comment 22, Para. 11: {{cite web|url=http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Issues/FreedomReligion/Pages/IstandardsI3k.aspx|title=Special Rapporteur on freedom of religion or belief. Framework for communications. Conscientious Objection|publisher=Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights|accessdate=2012-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; There were different meanings for this, for example, religious meanings (not believing in violence and/or killing), freedom of thought, conscience, and disability. In many countries Conscientious Objectors are forced to do other services as a substitute for military service. [[Conscientious Objector]]s were often seen as [[cowards]]. Many people from across the United Kingdom were considered to be Conscientious Objectors during the First World War, and the movement was as pronounced in [[Wales]] as in any other part of the county.

In Wales there was strong support for the movement from [[pacifists]] within the large [[non-conformist]] community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Pacifism in Wales|url=https://www.llgc.org.uk/ymgyrchu/Heddwch/Heddychiaeth/index-e.htm|website=National Library of Wales|accessdate=30 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==George Maitland Lloyd Davies==
{{main article|George Maitland Lloyd Davies}}

One of the most vocal opponents of [[conscription]] for the Great War was George Maitland Lloyd Davies (30 April 1880 – 16 December 1949), was born in [[Liverpool]]. He was imprisoned for opposing the Great War and conscription. He and his friend, Richard Roberts from Blaenau Ffestiniog, formed a Christian society to promote peace during World War I called the "Fellowship of Reconciliation" (Cymdeithas y Cymod). They published a magazine under the title "Y Deyrnas" from 1916 to 1919, with [[Thomas Rees (theologian)|Thomas Rees]], head of Bala-Bangor college as editor.

In 1937, the Welsh National Pacifist Society was established with George Maitland Lloyd Davies (G.M.LL.D) as president. At the end of 1937 a pamphlet had been published to go along with the launch of the society by the name of "Ymorthodwn a Rhyfel" (We Reject War).

'''Consociationalism''' ({{IPAc-en|k|ən|ˌ|s|oʊ|ʃ|i|ˈ|eɪ|ʃ|ən|əl|ɪ|z|əm}} {{respell|kən|SOH|shee|AY|shən-əl-iz-əm}}) is often viewed as synonymous with '''power-sharing''', although it is technically only one form of power-sharing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=O'Leary|first=Brendan|title=From Power Sharing to Democracy: Post-Conflict Institutions in Ethnically Divided Societies|editor=Noel, Sid JR|publisher=McGill-Queen's Press|location=Montreal |year=2005|pages=3–43|chapter=Debating consociational politics: Normative and explanatory arguments|isbn=0-7735-2948-9|url=https://books.google.com/?id=oQHX2Xz185EC&amp;printsec=frontcover#PPA3,M1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Consociationalism is often seen as having close affinities with [[corporatism]]; some consider it to be a form of corporatism while others claim that economic corporatism was designed to regulate [[class conflict]], while consociationalism developed on the basis of reconciling societal fragmentation along ethnic and religious lines.&lt;ref&gt;Anke Hassel. ''Wage setting, Social Pacts and the Euro: A New Role for the State''. Amsterdam, Netherlands: Amsterdam University Press, 2006. p. 281.&lt;/ref&gt;

The goals of consociationalism are governmental stability, the survival of the power-sharing arrangements, the survival of [[democracy]], and the avoidance of [[violence]]. When consociationalism is organised along religious confessional lines, it is known as [[confessionalism (politics)|confessionalism]], as is the case in [[Lebanon]].

==Definition==
[[Political science|Political scientists]] define a consociational state as a [[State (polity)|state]] which has major internal divisions along ethnic, religious, or linguistic lines, with none of the divisions large enough to form a majority group, yet nonetheless manages to remain stable, due to consultation among the [[elite]]s of each of its major social groups. Consociational states are often contrasted with states with [[majoritarian|majoritarian electoral systems]].

==Concept origins==
Consociation was a term and concept discussed in the 17th century [[New England Confederation]] with reference to the interassociation and cooperation of the participant independently self-governing [[Congregational church]]es of the various colonial townships of the [[Massachusetts Bay Colony]] (which were embedded in the civil legislature and magistracy&lt;ref&gt;W.H. Whitmore (ed.), ''The Colonial Laws of Massachusetts'' (Rockwell and Churchill, Boston 1890): 'The Body of Liberties of 1641', [https://archive.org/details/coloniallawsofma1890mass/page/n77 at pp. 29-68]; 'Records of the Court of Assistants, 1641-1644', [https://archive.org/details/coloniallawsofma1890mass/page/n23 pp. xix-xliii] (Google).&lt;/ref&gt;). It was debated at length in the [[Boston, Massachusetts|Boston]] Synod of 1662,&lt;ref&gt;J. Mitchel, ''Propositions concerning the subject of baptism and consociation of churches, collected and confirmed out of the word of God, by a synod of elders and messengers of the churches in Massachusetts-Colony in New England. Assembled at Boston, ... in the year 1662'' (Printed by S.G. [i.e., Samuel Green] for Hezekiah Usher at Boston in New-England, Cambridge Mass., 1662). Page views at [https://archive.org/details/propositionsconc00cong Internet Archive]. Full text at [https://quod.lib.umich.edu/cgi/t/text/text-idx?c=evans;cc=evans;rgn=div2;view=toc;idno=N00035.0001.001;node=N00035.0001.001%3A4.2 Evans/tcp] (open).&lt;/ref&gt; at the time when the Episcopalian [[Act of Uniformity 1662]] was being introduced in England.

Consociationalism was discussed in academic terms by the [[political science|political scientist]] [[Arend Lijphart]]. However, Lijphart has stated that he had "merely discovered what political practitioners had repeatedly – and independently of both academic experts and one another – invented years earlier".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=Arend|last=Lijphart|year=2004|url=http://ksghome.harvard.edu/~pnorris/Acrobat/stm103%20articles/lijphart%20Constitutional_Design.pdf|title=Constitutional design for divided societies|journal=[[Journal of Democracy]]|volume=15|issue=2|pages=96–109 [97]|doi=10.1353/jod.2004.0029}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[John McGarry]] and [[Brendan O'Leary]] trace consociationalism back to 1917, when it was first employed in the [[Netherlands]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=John|last=McGarry|author2=O'Leary, Brendan|year=1993|chapter=Introduction: The macro-political regulation of ethnic conflict|editor=McGarry, John |editor2=O'Leary, Brendan|title=The Politics of Ethnic Conflict Regulation: Case Studies of Protracted Ethnic Conflicts|location=London|publisher=Routledge|pages=1–40|isbn=0-415-07522-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Indeed, Lijphart draws heavily on the experience of the Netherlands in developing his argument in favour of the consociational approach to ethnic conflict regulation. The Netherlands, as a consociational state, was between 1857 and 1967 divided into four non-territorial [[Pillarisation|pillar]]s: [[Calvinist]], [[Catholic]], [[socialist]], and [[Secularism|general]], although until 1917 there was a [[plurality voting system|plurality]] ("first past the post") [[electoral system]] rather than a consociational one. In their heyday, each comprised tightly-organised groups, schools, universities, hospitals and newspapers, all divided along a pillarised social structure. The theory, according to Lijphart, focuses on the role of social elites, their agreement and co-operation, as the key to a stable democracy.

==Characteristics==
Lijphart identifies four key characteristics of consociational democracies:&lt;ref name="Lijphart 1977"&gt;{{cite book|first=Arend|last=Lijphart|year=1977|title=Democracy in Plural Societies: A Comparative Exploration|location=New Haven, CT|publisher=Yale University Press|isbn=0-300-02494-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{| class="wikitable" border="1"
|-
!Name
!Explanation
|-
|Grand coalition
|Elites of each pillar come together to rule in the interests of society because they recognize the dangers of non-cooperation.
|-
|Mutual veto
|Consensus among the groups is required to confirm the majority rule.  Mutuality means that the [[minority group|minority]] is unlikely to successfully block the majority.  If one group blocks another on some matter, the latter are likely to block the former in return.
|-
|Proportionality
|Representation is based on population. If one pillar accounts for 30% of the overall society, then they occupy 30% of the positions on the police force, in civil service, and in other national and civic segments of society.
|-
|Segmental autonomy
|Creates a sense of individuality and allows for different culturally-based community laws.
|}

Consociational policies often have these characteristics:&lt;ref&gt;Lijphart, Arend; Crepaz, Markus M. L. : Corporatism and Consensus Democracy in Eighteen Countries: Conceptual and Empirical
Linkages; British Journal of Political Science, Vol. 21, No. 2 (Apr., 1991), pp. 235–46&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Coalition government|Coalition cabinets]], where executive power is shared between parties, not concentrated in one. Many of these cabinets are oversized, meaning they include parties not necessary for a parliamentary majority;
*Balance of power between [[executive (government)|executive]] and [[legislative]];
*Decentralized and federal government, where (regional) [[minorities]] have considerable independence;
*Incongruent [[bicameralism]], where it is very difficult for one party to gain a majority in both houses. Normally one chamber represents regional interests and the other [[national interest]]s;
*[[Proportional representation]], to allow (small) [[minorities]] to gain representation too;
*Organized and [[corporatism|corporatist]] interest groups, which represent [[minorities]];
*A [[Rigid Constitution|rigid constitution]], which prevents government from changing the [[constitution]] without consent of minorities;
*[[Judicial review]], which allows [[minorities]] to go to the courts to seek redress against laws that they see as unjust;
*Elements of [[direct democracy]], which allow [[minorities]] to enact or prevent legislation;
*Proportional employment in the public sector;
*A neutral [[head of state]], either a [[monarchy|monarch]] with only ceremonial duties, or an indirectly elected president, who gives up his or her party affiliation after being elected;
*[[Referendum]]s are only used to allow [[minorities]] to block legislation: this means that they must be a [[initiative|citizen's initiative]] and that there is no compulsory voting.
*Equality between ministers in cabinet, the [[prime minister]] is only ''[[primus inter pares]]'';
*An independent [[central bank]], where experts and not politicians set out monetary policies.

==Favourable conditions==
Lijphart also identifies a number of "favourable conditions" under which consociationalism is likely to be successful. He has changed the specification of these conditions somewhat over time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bogaards|first=Matthijs|year=1998|title=The favourable factors for consociational democracy: A review|journal=European Journal of Political Research|pages=475–96|doi=10.1111/1475-6765.00392|volume=33|issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Michael Kerr summarises Lijphart's most prominent favourable factors as:&lt;ref name=Kerr&gt;{{cite book|last=Kerr|first=Michael|title=Imposing Power-Sharing: Conflict and Coexistence in Northern Ireland and Lebanon|publisher=Irish Academic Press|location=Dublin|pages=27–28|url=https://books.google.com/?id=bAHTAAAACAAJ&amp;dq=Imposing+Power-sharing:+Conflict+and+Coexistence+in+Northern+Ireland+and+Lebanon | isbn=978-0-7165-3383-2|year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Segmental isolation of ethnic communities
*A multiple balance of power
*The presence of external threats common to all communities
*Overarching loyalties to the state
*A tradition of elite accommodation
*Socioeconomic equality
*A small population size, reducing the policy load
*A moderate multi-party system with segmental parties

Lijphart stresses that these conditions are neither indispensable nor sufficient to account for the success of consociationalism.&lt;ref name="Lijphart 1977"/&gt; This has led Rinus van Schendelen to conclude that "the conditions may be present and absent, necessary and unnecessary, in short conditions or no conditions at all".&lt;ref name="van Schendelen"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=van Schendelen|first=M.C.P.M. | title = The views of Arend Lijphart and collected criticisms | journal = [[Acta Politica]] | volume = 19 | issue = 1 | pages = 19–49 | publisher = Palgrave Macmillan | date = 1984 | url = http://www.palgrave-journals.com/ap | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[John McGarry]] and [[Brendan O'Leary]] argue that three conditions are key to the establishment of democratic consociational power-sharing: elites have to be motivated to engage in conflict regulation; elites must lead deferential segments; and there must be a multiple balance of power, but more importantly the subcultures must be stable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=McGarry|first=John|author2=O'Leary, Brendan|title=Explaining Northern Ireland: Broken Images|publisher=Blackwell|location=Oxford|year=1995|url=https://books.google.com/?id=RPtXDMarWTEC&amp;dq=Explaining+Northern+Ireland&amp;pg=PP1|page=339 | isbn=978-0-631-18349-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Michael Kerr, in his study of the role of external actors in power-sharing arrangements in Northern Ireland and Lebanon, adds to McGarry and O'Leary's list the condition that "the existence of positive external regulating pressures, from state to non-state actors, which provide the internal elites with sufficient incentives and motives for their acceptance of, and support for, consociation".&lt;ref name=Kerr/&gt;

==Advantages==
In a consociational state, all groups, including minorities, are represented on the political and economic stage. Supporters of consociationalism argue that it is a more realistic option in deeply divided societies than [[Social integration|integrationist]] approaches to [[conflict management]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=John|last=McGarry|author2=O'Leary, Brendan|year=2006|title=Consociational theory, Northern Ireland's conflict, and its agreement 2: What critics of consociation can learn from Northern Ireland|journal=Government and Opposition|volume=41|issue=2|pages=249–77|doi=10.1111/j.1477-7053.2006.00178.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been credited with supporting successful and non-violent transitions to democracy in countries such as [[South Africa]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2007}}

==Criticisms==

===Brian Barry===
[[Brian Barry]] has questioned the nature of the divisions that exist in the countries that Lijphart considers to be "classic cases" of consociational democracies. For example, he makes the case that in the Swiss example, "political parties cross-cut cleavages in the society and provide a picture of remarkable consensus rather than highly structured conflict of goals".&lt;ref name="Barry 1975a"&gt;{{cite journal|first=Brian|last=Barry|year=1975|title=Political accommodation and consociational democracy|journal=British Journal of Political Science|volume=5|issue=4|pages=477–505|jstor=193439|doi=10.1017/S0007123400008322}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the case of the Netherlands, he argues that "the whole cause of the disagreement was the feeling of some Dutchman ... that it mattered what all the inhabitants of the country believed. Demands for policies aimed at producing religious or secular uniformity presuppose a concern ... for the state of grace of one's fellow citizens". He contrasts this to the case of a society marked by conflict, in this case [[Northern Ireland]], where he argues that "the inhabitants ... have never shown much worry about the prospects of the adherents of the other religion going to hell".&lt;ref name="Barry1975b"&gt;{{cite journal|first=Brian|last=Barry|year=1975|title=The consociational model and its dangers|journal=European Journal of Political Research|volume=3|issue=4|pages=393–412|doi=10.1111/j.1475-6765.1975.tb01253.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Barry concludes that in the Dutch case, consociationalism is [[Tautology (rhetoric)|tautological]] and argues that "the relevance of the 'consociational' model for other divided societies is much more doubtful than is commonly supposed".&lt;ref name="Barry 1975a"/&gt;

===Rinus van Schendelen===

[[Rinus van Schendelen]] has argued that Lijphart uses evidence selectively. [[Pillarisation]] was "seriously weakening", even in the 1950s, cross-denominational co-operation was increasing, and formerly coherent political sub-cultures were dissolving. He argued that elites in the Netherlands were not motivated by preferences derived from the general interest, but rather by self-interest. They formed coalitions not to forge consociational negotiation between segments but to improve their parties' respective power. He argued that the Netherlands was "stable" in that it had few protests or riots, but that it was so before consociationalism, and that it was not stable from the standpoint of government turnover. He questioned the extent to which the Netherlands, or indeed any country labelled a consociational system, could be called a democracy, and whether calling a consociational country a democracy isn't somehow ruled out by definition. He believed that Lijphart suffered severe problems of rigor when identifying whether particular divisions were cleavages, whether particular cleavages were segmental, and whether particular cleavages were cross-cutting.&lt;ref name="van Schendelen"/&gt;

===Lustick on hegemonic control===
[[Ian Lustick]] has argued that academics lack an alternative "control" approach for explaining stability in deeply divided societies and that this has resulted in the empirical overextension of consociational models.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=Ian|last=Lustick|year=1979|jstor=2009992|title=Stability in deeply divided societies: Consociationalism versus control|journal=World Politics|volume=31|issue=3|pages=325–44|doi=10.2307/2009992}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lustick argues that Lijphart has "an impressionistic methodological posture, flexible rules for coding data, and an indefatigable, rhetorically seductive commitment to promoting consociationalism as a widely applicable principle of political engineering",&lt;ref name="Lustick 1997"&gt;{{cite journal|first=Ian|last=Lustick|year=1997|title=Lijphart, Lakatos, and consociationalism|journal=World Politics|volume=50|issue=1|pages=88–117|doi=10.1017/S0043887100014738|jstor=25054028}}&lt;/ref&gt; that results in him applying consociational theory to case studies that it does not fit. Furthermore, Lustick states that "Lijphart's definition of 'accommodation' ... includes the elaborately specified claim that issues dividing polarized blocs are settled by leaders convinced of the need for settlement".&lt;ref name="Lustick 1997"/&gt;

===Other criticisms===
Critics point out that consociationalism is dangerous in a system of differing [[antagonist]]ic [[ideologies]], generally [[conservatism]] and [[communism]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}} They state that specific conditions must exist for three or more groups to develop a multi- system with strong leaders. This philosophy is dominated by elites, with those masses that are sidelined with the elites having less to lose if war breaks out. Consociationalism cannot be imperially applied. For example, it does not effectively apply to [[Austria]].  Critics also point to the failure of this line of reasoning in [[Lebanon]], a country that reverted to civil war. It only truly applies in [[Switzerland]], [[Belgium]] and the Netherlands, and not in more deeply divided societies. If one of three groups gets half plus one of the vote, then the other groups are in perpetual opposition, which is largely incompatible with consociationalism.

Consociationalism focuses on diverging identities such as ethnicity instead of integrating identities such as class, institutionalizing and entrenching the former. Furthermore, it relies on rival co-operation, which is inherently unstable. It focuses on intrastate relations and neglects relations with other states. [[Donald L. Horowitz]] argues that consociationalism can lead to the reification of ethnic divisions, since "grand coalitions are unlikely, because of the dynamics of intraethnic competition. The very act of forming a multiethnic coalition generates intraethnic competition – flanking – if it does not already exist".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Donald|last=Horowitz|year=1985|title=Ethnic Groups in Conflict|location=Berkeley, CA|publisher=University of California Press|page=575|isbn=0-520-22706-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Consistent with Horowitz' claims, Dawn Brancati finds that federalism/territorial autonomy, an element of consociationalism, strengthens ethnic divisions if it is designed in a way that strengthens regional parties, which in turn encourage ethnic conflict.&lt;ref&gt;Dawn Brancati, ''Peace by Design: Managing Intrastate Conflict through Decentralization'', Oxford University Press, 2009,&lt;/ref&gt;

Consociationalism assumes that each group is cohesive and has strong leadership.  Although the minority can block decisions, this requires 100 per cent agreement. Rights are given to communities rather than individuals, leading to over-representation of some individuals in society and under-representation of others. Grand coalitions are unlikely to happen due to the dynamics of ethnic competition.  Each group seeks more power for itself. Consociationalists are criticized for focusing too much on the set up of institutions and not enough on transitional issues which go beyond such institutions. Finally, it is claimed that consociational institutions promote [[sectarianism]] and entrench existing identities.

==Examples==
The political systems of a number of countries operate or used to operate on a consociational basis, including [[Politics of Belgium|Belgium]], [[Politics of Cyprus#United Cyprus|Cyprus]] (effective 1960–1963),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wolff|first1=Stefan|title=Disputed Territories: The Transnational Dynamics of Ethnic Conflict Settlement|date=2004|publisher=Berghahn Books|pages=30–31|url=https://www.google.com/books?id=QYTKZ0z6QygC}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wippman|first1=David|editor1-last=Wippman|editor1-first=David|title=International Law and Ethnic Conflict|date=1998|publisher=Cornell University Press|page=220|url=https://www.google.com/books?id=uy1CCqO6qUIC|chapter=Practical and Legal Constraints on Internal Power Sharing}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bahcheli|first1=Tozun|last2=Noel|first2=Sid|editor1-last=Noel|editor1-first=Sid|title=Relations of Ruling: Class and Gender in Postindustrial Societies|date=2005|publisher=McGill-Queen's University Press|page=215|url=https://www.google.com/books?id=oQHX2Xz185EC|chapter=Power Sharing for Cyprus (Again)? European Union Accession and the Prospects for Reunification}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Politics of Lebanon|Lebanon]], the [[Politics of the Netherlands|Netherlands]] (1917–1967), [[Politics of Switzerland|Switzerland]], and [[Politics of South Africa|South Africa]]. Some academics have also argued that the [[European Union]] resembles a consociational democracy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gabel|first=Matthew J.|year=1998|title=The endurance of supranational governance: A consociational interpretation of the European Union|jstor=422334|journal=Comparative Politics|volume=30|issue=4|pages=463–75|doi=10.2307/422334}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bogaards|first=Matthijs|author2=Crepaz, Markus M.L.|year=2002|title=Consociational interpretations of the European Union|journal=[[European Union Politics]]|volume=3|issue=3|pages=357–81|doi=10.1177/1465116502003003004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, a number of peace agreements are consociational, including:
* the [[Dayton Agreement]] that ended the 1992–1995 [[War in Bosnia and Herzegovina|war]] in [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], which is described as a "classic example of consociational settlement" by [[Sumantra Bose]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Sumantra|last=Bose|year=2002|title=Bosnia After Dayton: Nationalist Partition and International Intervention|location=Oxford|publisher=Oxford University Press|page=216|isbn=1-85065-585-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; and "an ideal-typical consociational democracy" by Roberto Belloni.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=Roberto|last=Belloni|year=2004|title=Peacebuilding and consociational electoral engineering in Bosnia and Herzegovina|journal=International Peacekeeping|volume=11|issue=2|pages=334–53 [336]|doi=10.1080/1353331042000237300 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* the [[Belfast Agreement]] of 1998 in Northern Ireland&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=O'Leary|first=Brendan|year=2001|chapter=The character of the 1998 Agreement: Results and prospects|pages=49–83|editor=Wilford, Rick|title=Aspects of the Belfast Agreement|location=Oxford|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=0-19-924262-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; (and its subsequent reinforcement with 2006's [[St Andrews Agreement]]), which Brendan O'Leary describes as "power-sharing plus".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=Brendan|last=O'Leary|year=1999|title=The 1998 British-Irish Agreement: Power-sharing plus|journal=Scottish Affairs|volume=26|pages=14–35}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* the [[Ohrid Agreement]] of 2001 setting the constitutional framework for power-sharing in the [[Republic of Macedonia]].

In addition to the [[two-state solution]], some have argued for a [[one-state solution]] under a consociational democracy in the state of [[Israel]] to solve the [[Arab-Israeli Conflict]], but this solution is not very popular, nor has it been discussed seriously at peace negotiations.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=fSQQBdRFmwIC&amp;pg=PA127&amp;lpg=PA127&amp;dq=Israeli+Consociationalism#v=onepage&amp;q=Israeli%20Consociationalism&amp;f=false ''Israel and the Politics of Jewish Identity: The Secular-Religious Impasse''] By Asher Cohen, Bernard Susser. Google Books (Retrieved 2011-1-30)&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1980s the South African government attempted to reform apartheid into a consociational democracy. The South African Constitution of 1983 applied Lijpart's powersharing ideas by establishing a Tricameral Parliament.  During the 1990s negotiations to end apartheid the National Party (NP) and Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP) proposed a settlement based upon consociationalism. The African National Congress (ANC) opposed consociationalism and proposed instead a settlement based upon majoritarian democracy. The NP abandoned consociationalism when the U.S. Department of State came out in favor of the majoritarian democracy model in 1992.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=James|last=Hamill|year=2003|title=A disguised surrender?

{{canon law}}
{{unreferenced|date=August 2013}}

A '''''contractum trinius''''' was a set of contracts devised by [[Europe]]an bankers and merchants in the [[Middle Ages]] as a method of circumventing [[canon law (Catholic Church)|canonical laws]] prohibiting [[usury]] as a part of [[Christian finance]]. At the time, most Christian nations heavily incorporated scripture into their laws, and as such it was illegal for any person to charge [[interest]] on a loan of money.

To get around this, a set of three separate contracts were presented to someone seeking a loan: an [[investment]], a [[sale of profit]] and an [[insurance]] contract. Each of these contracts were permissible under canon law, but together replicated the effect of an interest-bearing loan.

The way this procedure worked was as follows: The lender would invest a sum equal to the amount of financing required by the borrower for one year. The lender would then purchase insurance for the investment from the borrower, and finally sell to the borrower the right to any profit made over a pre-arranged percentage of the investment. This system replicated the effects of a loan with any interest rate agreed between the two, yet provided protection to the lender against [[Default (finance)|default]], while the borrower remained under the protection of the law when it came to collection of the money by threats or force ([[loan shark]]ing).

The Church proved utterly unable to legislate against the ''contractum trinius'', and the idea quickly spread to merchants and bankers across [[Christendom]]. It was accepted by writers such as [[Gabriel Biel]]; it helped in part to improve public perception of the practice of usury by moneylenders, and ultimately the doctrine was rewritten by the [[School of Salamanca]], and the ban on interest-bearing loans overturned in many [[Protestant]] countries, starting with [[England]] by [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]].

Some Muslims are of the view that the present practice of [[Islamic banking]] relies on devices similar to the contractum trinius as a means of working around a ban of [[riba]] (usury) in religious scripture.

{{DISPLAYTITLE:''Corpus Juris Civilis''}}
{{refimprove|date=April 2011}}
[[File:Mosaic of Justinianus I - Basilica San Vitale (Ravenna).jpg|right|thumb|Justinian I depicted on a [[mosaic]] in the church of [[Basilica of San Vitale|San Vitale]], Ravenna, Italy]]

The '''''Corpus Juris''''' (or '''''Iuris''''')  '''''Civilis''''' ("Body of Civil Law") is the modern name&lt;ref&gt;The name "Corpus Juris Civilis" occurs for the first time in 1583 as the title of a complete edition of the Justinianic code by Dionysius Godofredus. (Kunkel, W. ''An Introduction to Roman Legal and Constitutional History''. Oxford 1966 (translated into English by J.M. Kelly), p. 157, n. 2)&lt;/ref&gt; for a collection of fundamental works in [[jurisprudence]], issued from 529 to 534 by order of [[Justinian I]], [[Byzantine Emperors|Eastern Roman Emperor]]. It is also sometimes referred to as the '''Code of Justinian''', although this name belongs more properly to the part titled ''[[Codex Justinianus]]''.

The work as planned had three parts:  the ''Code'' (''Codex'') is a compilation, by selection and extraction, of imperial enactments to date; the ''Digest'' or ''Pandects'' (the Latin title contains both ''Digesta'' and ''Pandectae'') is an encyclopedia composed of mostly brief extracts from the writings of Roman jurists; and the ''Institutes'' (''Institutiones'') is a student textbook, mainly introducing the ''Code'', although it has important conceptual elements that are less developed in the ''Code'' or the ''Digest''. All three parts, even the textbook, were given force of law. They were intended to be, together, the sole source of law; reference to any other source, including the original texts from which the ''Code'' and the ''Digest'' had been taken, was forbidden. Nonetheless, Justinian found himself having to enact further laws and today these are counted as a fourth part of the Corpus, the ''[[Novellae Constitutiones]]'' (''Novels'', literally ''New Laws'').

The work was directed by [[Tribonian]], an official in Justinian's court. His team was authorized to edit what they included. How far they made amendments is not recorded and, in the main, cannot be known because most of the originals have not survived. The text was composed and distributed almost entirely in [[Latin]], which was still the official language of the government of the [[Byzantine Empire]] in 529–534, whereas the prevalent language of merchants, farmers, seamen, and other citizens was [[Greek language|Greek]]. By the early 7th century, the official government language had become Greek during the lengthy reign of [[Heraclius]] (610–641).

How far the ''Corpus Juris Civilis'' or any of its parts was effective, whether in the east or (with reconquest) in the west, is unknown. However, it was not in general use during the [[Early Middle Ages]]. After the Early Middle Ages, interest in it revived. It was "received" or imitated as [[private law]] and its [[public law]] content was quarried for arguments by both secular and ecclesiastical authorities. This revived Roman law, in turn, became the foundation of law in all [[civil law (legal system)|civil law]] jurisdictions. The provisions of the ''Corpus Juris Civilis'' also influenced the [[Canon law (Catholic Church)|canon law]] of the [[Roman Catholic Church]]: it was said that ''ecclesia vivit lege romana'' – the church lives by Roman law.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. ''[[Lex Ripuaria]]'', tit. 58, c. 1: "Episcopus archidiaconum jubeat, ut ei tabulas secundum legem romanam, qua ecclesia vivit, scribere faciat". ([https://books.google.com/books?id=7I8GAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA169&amp;dq=%22secundum+legem+romanam+qua+ecclesia+vivit])&lt;/ref&gt; Its influence on [[common law]] legal systems has been much smaller, although some basic concepts from the Corpus have survived through [[Norman law]] – such as the contrast, especially in the ''Institutes'', between "law" (statute) and custom. The Corpus continues to have a major influence on [[public international law]]. Its four parts thus constitute the foundation documents of the [[Western legal tradition]].

==Compilation Process==

===Codex===
Justinian acceded to the imperial throne in [[Constantinople]] in 527.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Kaiser |first1=Wolfgang |title=The Cambridge Companion to Roman Law |date=2015 |page=119-148}}&lt;/ref&gt; Six months after his accession, in order to reduce the great number of imperial constitutions and thus also the number of court proceedings, Justinian arranged for the creation of a new collection of imperial constitutions (Codex Iustinianus).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Kaiser |first1=Wolfgang |title=The Cambridge Companion to Roman Law |date=2015 |page=119-148}}&lt;/ref&gt; The commission in charge of the compilation process was explicitly authorized to leave out or change text and to delete what was obsolete or contradictory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Kaiser |first1=Wolfgang |title=The Cambridge Companion to Roman Law |date=2015 |page=119-148}}&lt;/ref&gt; Soon, in 529, the Codex was completed and was conferred the force of law in the whole empire, replacing all earlier constitutiones and the Theodosian Code.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Kaiser |first1=Wolfgang |title=The Cambridge Companion to Roman Law |date=2015 |page=119-148}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Digesta===
A little more than a year after the enactment of the first edition of the Code, Justinian appointed a commission to compile the traditional jurists’ law in a new, shortened and contemporary codification: the ‘Digest or Pandects’.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Kaiser |first1=Wolfgang |title=The Cambridge Companion to Roman Law |date=2015 |page=119-148}}&lt;/ref&gt; The traditional collection of jurists’ law, Justinian believed, was so extensive that it had become unmanageable, necessitating a new compilation. The commission completed its work within three years, in 533.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Kaiser |first1=Wolfgang |title=The Cambridge Companion to Roman Law |date=2015 |page=119-148}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The commission surveyed the works of classical jurists who were assumed in Justinian’s time to have the authority to clarify law (''ius respondendi'') and whose works were still available.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Kaiser |first1=Wolfgang |title=The Cambridge Companion to Roman Law |date=2015 |page=119-148}}&lt;/ref&gt; In total, there are excerpts from 38 jurists in the Digest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Kaiser |first1=Wolfgang |title=The Cambridge Companion to Roman Law |date=2015 |page=119-148}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==The Four Parts==

===Codex===
{{Main|Codex Justinianus}} 
The "Codex" was the first part to be finished, on 7 April 529. It contained in [[Latin]] most of the existing imperial ''constitutiones'' (imperial pronouncements having force of law), back to the time of [[Hadrian]]. It used both the ''[[Codex Theodosianus]]'' and the fourth-century collections embodied in the ''[[Codex Gregorianus]]'' and ''[[Codex Hermogenianus]]'', which provided the model for division into books that were themselves divided into titles. These works had developed authoritative standing.&lt;ref&gt;George Long, in William Smith, ed., ''A Dictionary of Greek and Roman Antiquities, (London: Murray) 1875 ([http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/secondary/SMIGRA*/Codex_G_et_H.html On-line text]).&lt;/ref&gt; This first edition is now lost; a second edition was issued in 534 and is the text that has survived. At least the second edition contained some of Justinian's own legislation, including some legislation in Greek. It is not known whether he intended there to be further editions, although he did envisage translation of Latin enactments into Greek.

====Legislation about religion====
Numerous provisions served to secure the status of Christianity as the [[state religion]] of the empire, uniting Church and state, and making anyone who was not connected to the Christian church a non-citizen. Note that in this regard the Christianity referred to is orthodox Roman Christianity as defined by the state church, which excluded a variety of other Christian sects in existence at the time.

=====Laws against heresy=====
The very first law in the Codex requires all persons under the jurisdiction of the Empire to hold the Christian faith. This was primarily aimed against heresies such as [[Nestorianism]]. This text later became the springboard for discussions of international law, especially the question of just what persons are under the jurisdiction of a given state or legal system.

=====Laws against paganism=====
Other laws, while not aimed at pagan belief as such, forbid particular pagan practices. For example, it is provided that all persons present at a pagan sacrifice may be indicted as if for murder.

===Digesta===
{{Main|Digest (Roman law)}}
The ''Digesta'' or ''Pandectae'', completed in 533, is a collection of juristic writings, mostly dating back to the second and third centuries. Fragments were taken out of various legal treatises and opinions and inserted in the Digest. In their original context, the statements of the law contained in these fragments were just private opinions of legal scholars - although some juristic writings had been privileged by Theodosius II's [[Law of Citations]] in 426. The Digest, however, was given complete force of law.

===Institutiones===
{{Main|Institutes of Justinian}}
As the ''Digest'' neared completion, [[Tribonian]] and two professors, Theophilus and [[Dorotheus (jurist)|Dorotheus]], made a student textbook, called the ''Institutions'' or ''Elements''. As there were four elements, the manual consists of four books. The ''Institutiones'' are largely based on the ''Institutiones'' of [[Gaius (jurist)|Gaius]]. Two thirds of the ''Institutiones'' of Justinian consists of literal quotes from Gaius. The new ''Institutiones'' were used as a manual for jurists in training from 21 November 533 and were given the authority of law on 30 December 533 along with the ''Digest''.

===Novellae===
{{Main|Novellae Constitutiones}}

The Novellae consisted of new laws that were passed after 534. They were later re-worked into the ''Syntagma'', a practical lawyer's edition, by [[Athanasios of Emesa]] during the years 572&amp;ndash;77.

==Continuation in the East==
The term ''Byzantine Empire'' is used today to refer to what remained of the Roman Empire in the Eastern Mediterranean following the collapse of the Empire in the West. This Eastern empire continued to practice [[Roman Law]] and formalized it via the Corpus Juris Civilis. The law was modified to be adequate for the new social relationships in the [[Middle ages]], and to account for the language shift of the empire's administration from Latin to Greek. Thus the tradition of [[Byzantine law]] was created. New Greek [[legal code]]s, based on Corpus Juris Civilis, were enacted. The most known are: Ecloga&lt;ref&gt;http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/178179/Ecloga&lt;/ref&gt; (740)—enacted by emperor [[Leo the Isaurian]], Proheiron&lt;ref&gt;http://www.doiserbia.nb.rs/img/doi/0584-9888/2004/0584-98880441099S.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; (c. 879)—enacted by emperor [[Basil the Macedonian]] and [[Basilika]] (late 9th century)—started by Basil the Macedonian and finished by his son emperor [[Leo the Wise]]. The Basilika was a complete adaptation of Justinian's codification. At 60 volumes it proved to be difficult for judges and lawyers to use. There was need for a short and handy version. This was finally made by [[Konstantinos Armenopoulos|Constantine Harmenopoulos]], a Byzantine judge from [[Thessaloniki]], in 1345. He made a short version of Basilika in six books, called ''Hexabiblos''. This was widely used throughout the Balkans during the following Ottoman period, and along with the Basilika was used as the first legal code for the newly [[First Hellenic Republic|independent Greek state]] in the 1820s. [[Serbia]]n state, law and culture was built on the foundations of Rome and Byzantium. Therefore, the most important Serbian legal codes: [[Zakonopravilo]] (1219) and [[Dušan's Code]] (1349 and 1354), [[Legal transplants|transplanted]] Roman-Byzantine Law included in Corpus Juris Civilis, Prohiron and Basilika. These Serbian codes were practised until the [[Serbian Despotate]] fell to the Turkish [[Ottoman Empire]] in 1459. After the liberation from the Turks in the [[Serbian Revolution]], [[Serbs]] continued to practise Roman Law by enacting Serbian civil code in 1844. It was a short version of [[Allgemeines bürgerliches Gesetzbuch|Austrian civil code]] (called ''Allgemeines bürgerliches Gesetzbuch''), which was made on the basis of Corpus Juris Civilis.

==Recovery in the West==
[[Image:Corpus Iuris Civilis 02.jpg|right|thumb|200px|''Corpus Iuris Civilis'', 1583]]
{{Refimprove section|date=September 2014}}

Justinian's ''Corpus Juris Civilis'' was distributed in the West&lt;ref&gt;As the ''[[Littera Florentina]]'', a copy recovered in [[Pisa]], demonstrates.&lt;/ref&gt; but was lost sight of; it was scarcely needed in the comparatively primitive conditions that followed the loss of the [[Exarchate of Ravenna]] by the Byzantine empire in the 8th century. The only western province where the Justinianic code was effectively introduced was Italy, following its recovery by Byzantine armies ([[Pragmatic Sanction]] of 554), but a continuous tradition of Roman law in medieval Italy has not been proven.&lt;ref&gt;Kunkel, W. (translated by J.M. Kelly) ''An Introduction to Roman Legal and Constitutional History.'' Oxford, Clarendon Press, 1966; 168-69&lt;/ref&gt; As Western Europe was conquered by Germanic tribes, Germanic legal traditions took hold, influenced locally by Roman traditions to some degree, but still largely divorced from the complex Roman legal system.

Historians disagree on the precise way the Corpus was recovered in Northern Italy about 1070: legal studies were undertaken on behalf of papal authority central to the [[Gregorian Reform]] of [[Pope Gregory VII]], which may have led to its accidental rediscovery.{{Citation needed|date = September 2014}} Aside from the [[Littera Florentina]] (a 6th-century codex of the [[Pandects]] that was preserved at [[Pisa]]) there may have been other manuscript sources for the text that began to be taught at Bologna, by [[Pepo (jurist)|Pepo]] and then by [[Irnerius]].&lt;ref&gt;For a detailed account of how the relevant manuscripts and their transmission, see Charles M. Radding &amp; Antonio Ciaralli, "The Corpus Juris Civilis in the MIddle Ages: Manuscripts and Transmission from the Sixth Century to the Juristic Revival" (Brill, Leiden, 2007).&lt;/ref&gt; Irnerius' technique was to read a passage aloud, which permitted his students to copy it, then to deliver an excursus explaining and illuminating Justinian's text, in the form of [[Gloss (annotation)|glosses]].{{citation needed|date = September 2014}} Irnerius' pupils, the so-called [[Four Doctors of Bologna]], were among the first of the "[[glossators]]" who established the curriculum of [[medieval Roman law]]. The tradition was carried on by French lawyers, known as the [[Ultramontanism|Ultramontani]], in the 13th century.{{Citation needed|date = September 2014}}

The merchant classes of [[Medieval commune|Italian communes]] required law with a concept of [[Justice|equity]], and law that covered situations inherent in urban life better than the primitive Germanic oral traditions. The provenance of the Code appealed to scholars who saw in the [[Holy Roman Empire]] a revival of venerable precedents from the classical heritage. The new class of lawyers staffed the bureaucracies that were beginning to be required by the princes of Europe. The [[University of Bologna]], where Justinian's Code was first taught, remained the dominant centre for the study of law through the [[High Middle Ages]].{{Citation needed|date = September 2014}}

A two-volume edition of the Digest was published in Paris in 1549 and 1550, translated by Antonio Agustín, Bishop of Tarragona, who was well known for other legal works. The full title of the Digest was ''Digestorum Seu Pandectarum tomus alter'', and it was published by "Apud Carolam Guillards". Vol. 1 of the Digest has 2934 pages, while Vol. 2 has 2754 pages. Referring to Justinian's Code as ''Corpus Juris Civilis'' was only adopted in the 16th century, when it was printed in 1583 by [[Denis Godefroy|Dionysius Gothofredus]] under this title.  The legal thinking behind the ''Corpus Juris Civilis'' served as the backbone of the single largest legal reform of the modern age, the [[Napoleonic Code]], which marked the abolition of [[feudalism]]. Napoleon wanted to see these principles introduced to the whole of Europe because he saw them as an effective form of rule that created a more equal society and thus creating a more friendly relationship between the ruling class and the rest of the peoples of Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Senkowska-Gluck, Monika. "Effects of Napoleonic Legislation on the Development of the 19th-century Europe." ''Acta Poloniae Historica'' 38 (1978): 185-198.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Corpus Juris Civilis'' was translated into French, German, Italian, and Spanish in the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;Hulot, H. et al., ''Corpus iuris civilis.  Le Digeste, les Institutes, le Code, les Nouvelles'' 14 vols (1803-11); Otto, C.E., Schilling, B., Sintenis, C.F.F., ''Das Corpus Iuris Civilis in's Deutsche übersetzt...'' 7 vols. (1831-39); Vignali, G., ''Corpo del diritto, corredato delle note di D. Gotofredo...'' 10 vols. (1856-62); Rodriguez de Fonseca, B. et al., ''Cuerpo del derecho civil...'' 2 vols. (1874)&lt;/ref&gt;  However, no English translation of the entire ''Corpus Juris Civilis ''existed until 1932 when [[Samuel Parsons Scott]] published his version ''The Civil Law''.  Scott did not base his translation on the best available Latin versions, and his work was severely criticized.&lt;ref&gt;See Timothy Kearley, [http://www.uwyo.edu/lawlib/blume-justinian/_files/docs/historyajcrev-1.pdf ''Justice Fred Blume and the Translation of the Justinian Code''] (2nd ed. 2008) 3, 21.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Fred H. Blume|Fred. H. Blume]] used the best-regarded Latin editions for his translations of the Code and of the Novels.&lt;ref&gt;Id. at 3.

Scott, Fred Blume, Clyde Pharr, and Roman Law in Early Twentieth-Century," available at Social Science Research Network [http://ssrn.com/abstract=2737986].&lt;/ref&gt; A new English translation of the Code, based on Blume's, was published in October 2016.&lt;ref&gt;Bruce W. Frier, ed. (2016), The Codex of Justinian. A New Annotated Translation, with Parallel Latin and Greek Text, Cambridge University Press, p. 2963, {{ISBN|9780521196826}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15090">In [[finance]], a '''credit derivative''' refers to any one of "various instruments and techniques designed to separate and then transfer the ''[[credit risk]]''"&lt;ref name=Econ1&gt;[[The Economist]] ''Passing on the risks'' 2 November 1996&lt;/ref&gt; or the risk of an event of default of a corporate or sovereign borrower, transferring it to an entity other than the lender&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last = Das |first = Satyajit |title = Credit Derivatives: CDOs and Structured Credit Products, 3rd Edition |publisher = Wiley |year = 2005 |isbn = 978-0-470-82159-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Secret Liens" /&gt; or debtholder.

An unfunded credit derivative is one where credit protection is bought and sold between bilateral counterparties without the protection seller having to put up money upfront or at any given time during the life of the deal unless an event of default occurs. Usually these contracts are traded pursuant to an [[International Swaps and Derivatives Association]] (ISDA) master agreement. Most credit derivatives of this sort are [[credit default swap]]s. If the credit derivative is entered into by a financial institution or a [[special purpose vehicle]] (SPV) and payments under the credit derivative are funded using [[securitization]] techniques, such that a debt obligation is issued by the financial institution or SPV to support these obligations, this is known as a funded credit derivative.

This synthetic securitization process has become increasingly popular over the last decade, with the simple versions of these structures being known as synthetic [[collateralized debt obligation]]s (CDOs), [[credit-linked note]]s or [[single-tranche CDO]]s. In funded credit derivatives, transactions are often rated by rating agencies, which allows investors to take different slices of credit risk according to their risk appetite.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1 = Bruyere |first1 = Richard |last2 = Cont|first2 = Rama |title = Credit Derivatives and Structured Credit: A guide for investors |publisher = Wiley |year = 2006 |isbn = 978-0470018798}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Credit market participants, regulators, and courts are increasingly using credit derivative pricing to help inform decisions about loan pricing, risk management, capital requirements, and legal liability.&lt;ref name="FT"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Michael Simkovic|editor1-last=Adler|editor1-first=Barry|title=Making Fraudulent Transfer Law More Predictable, in Handbook on Corporate Bankruptcy|date=2016|publisher=Edward Elgar|ssrn=2775920}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="LBO"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Simkovic|first1=Michael|last2=Kaminetzky|first2=Benjamin|title=Leveraged Buyout Bankruptcies, the Problem of Hindsight Bias, and the Credit Default Swap Solution|journal=Columbia Business Law Review|date=2011|volume=2011|page=118|ssrn=1632084}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ALI"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Simkovic|first1=Michael|title=What Can We Learn from Credit Markets|journal=Proceedings of the 93rd Annual Meeting of the American Law Institute|date=2016|ssrn=2782844}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History and participants ==
The market in credit derivatives started from nothing in 1993 after having been pioneered by [[J.P. Morgan]]'s Peter Hancock.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=AIG: America’s Improved Giant |url=https://www.economist.com/news/finance-and-economics/21571139-insurer-has-done-good-job-rehabilitating-itself-can-it-stand-its-own |newspaper=The Economist |location=London |date=February 2, 2013 |accessdate=March 30, 2015 }}

&lt;/ref&gt; By 1996 there was around $40 billion of outstanding transactions, half of which involved the [[debt of developing countries]].&lt;ref name=Econ1/&gt;

Credit default products are the most commonly traded credit derivative product&lt;ref name="BBACDR"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bba.org.uk/content/1/c4/76/71/Credit_derivative_report_2006_exec_summary.pdf|format=PDF|title=British Banker Association Credit Derivatives Report |date=2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and include unfunded products such as [[credit default swap]]s and funded products such as [[collateralized debt obligation]]s (see further discussion below).

On May 15, 2007, in a speech concerning credit derivatives and liquidity risk, Geithner stated: “Financial innovation has improved the capacity to measure and manage risk.” &lt;ref&gt;Remarks at the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta's 2007 Financial Markets Conference—Credit Derivatives, Sea Island, Georgia&lt;/ref&gt;  Credit market participants, regulators, and courts are increasingly using credit derivative pricing to help inform decisions about loan pricing, risk management, capital requirements, and legal liability.&lt;ref name="FT"/&gt;&lt;ref name="LBO"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ALI"/&gt;
The ISDA&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.isda.org|title=ISDA |date=April 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; reported in April 2007 that total notional amount on outstanding credit derivatives was $35.1 trillion with a gross [[market value]] of $948 billion ([http://www.isda.org ISDA's Website]). As reported in ''[[The Times]]'' on September 15, 2008, the "Worldwide credit derivatives market is valued at $62 trillion".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://business.timesonline.co.uk/tol/business/industry_sectors/banking_and_finance/article4761839.ece | work=The Times | location=London | title=Dow dives as Federal Reserve lines up 75bn emergency loan for AIG | date=September 16, 2008 | accessdate=April 30, 2010 | first1=Patrick | last1=Hosking | first2=Miles | last2=Costello | first3=Marcus | last3=Leroux}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the credit [[derivatives market]] is a global one, London has a market share of about 40%, with the rest of Europe having about 10%.&lt;ref name="BBACDR" /&gt;

The main market participants are banks, hedge funds, insurance companies, pension funds, and other corporates.&lt;ref name="BBACDR" /&gt;

== Types ==
Credit derivatives are fundamentally divided into two categories: funded credit derivatives and unfunded credit derivatives.

An '''unfunded credit derivative''' is a bilateral contract between two counterparties, where each party is responsible for making its payments under the contract (i.e., payments of premiums and any cash or physical settlement amount) itself without recourse to other assets.

A '''funded credit derivative''' involves the protection seller (the party that assumes the credit risk) making an initial payment that is used to settle any potential credit events. (The protection buyer, however, still may be exposed to the ''credit risk'' of the ''protection seller'' itself. This is known as counterparty risk.)

Unfunded credit derivative products include the following products:
* [[Credit default swap]] (CDS)
* [[Total return swap]]
* [[Constant maturity credit default swap]] (CMCDS)
* First to Default Credit Default Swap
* Portfolio Credit Default Swap
* Secured Loan Credit Default Swap
* Credit Default Swap on Asset Backed Securities
* Credit default [[swaption]]
* Recovery lock transaction
* Credit Spread Option
* CDS index products

Funded credit derivative products include the following products:
* [[Credit-linked note]] (CLN)
* Synthetic [[collateralized debt obligation]] (CDO)
* [[Constant Proportion Debt Obligation]] (CPDO)
* Synthetic [[constant proportion portfolio insurance]] (Synthetic CPPI)

=== Key unfunded credit derivative products ===

==== Credit default swap ====
{{Main|Credit default swap}}
The credit default swap or CDS has become the cornerstone product of the credit derivatives market.  This product represents over thirty percent of the credit derivatives market.&lt;ref name="BBACDR"/&gt;

The product has many variations, including where there is a basket or portfolio of reference entities, although fundamentally, the principles remain the same.  A powerful recent variation has been gathering market share of late: credit default swaps which relate to asset-backed securities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web  |last1=Parker |first1=Edmund |last2=Piracci |first2=Jamila |url=http://www.mayerbrown.com/london/article.asp?id=3517&amp;nid=1575|title=Documenting credit default swaps on asset backed securities |publisher=Mayer Brown |date=April 19, 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110521170516/http://www.mayerbrown.com/london/article.asp?id=3517&amp;nid=1575 |archivedate=May 21, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Total return swap ====

=== Key funded credit derivative products ===

==== Credit linked notes ====
[[Image:Securitization-en.PNG|thumb|RIGHT|400px|In this example coupons from the bank's portfolio of loans are passed to the SPV which uses the cash flow to service the credit linked notes.]]
A credit linked note is a note whose cash flow depends upon an event, which may be a default, change in credit spread, or rating change. The definition of the relevant credit events must be negotiated by the parties to the note.

A CLN in effect combines a credit-default swap with a regular note (with coupon, maturity, redemption).  Given its note-like features, a CLN is an on-balance-sheet asset, in contrast to a CDS.

Typically, an investment fund manager will purchase such a note to hedge against possible down grades, or loan defaults.

Numerous different types of credit linked notes (CLNs) have been structured and placed in the past few years. Here we are going to provide an overview rather than a detailed account of these instruments.

The most basic CLN consists of a bond, issued by a well-rated borrower, packaged with a credit default swap on a less creditworthy risk.

For example, a bank may sell some of its exposure to a particular emerging country by issuing a bond linked to that country's default or convertibility risk. From the bank's point of view, this achieves the purpose of reducing its exposure to that risk, as it will not need to reimburse all or part of the note if a credit event occurs. However, from the point of view of investors, the risk profile is different from that of the bonds issued by the country. If the bank runs into difficulty, their investments will suffer even if the country is still performing well.

The credit rating is improved by using a proportion of government bonds, which means the CLN investor receives an enhanced coupon.

Through the use of a credit default swap, the bank receives some recompense if the reference credit defaults.

There are several different types of securitized product, which have a credit dimension.
* [[Credit-linked note]]s (CLN): Credit-linked note is a generic name related to any bond whose value is linked to the performance of a reference asset, or assets. This link may be through the use of a credit derivative, but does not have to be.
* [[Collateralized debt obligation]] (CDO): Generic term for a bond issued against a mixed pool of assets—there also exists [[CDO-Squared]] (CDO^2) where the underlying assets are CDO tranches.
* [[Collateralized bond obligation]]s (CBO): Bond issued against a pool of bond assets or other securities. It is referred to in a generic sense as a CDO
* [[Collateralized loan obligation]]s (CLO): Bond issued against a pool of bank loan. It is referred to in a generic sense as a '''CDO'''

CDO refers either to the pool of assets used to support the CLNs or the CLNs themselves.

==== Collateralized debt obligations  ====
{{main|collateralized debt obligation}}
Not all collateralized debt obligations (CDOs) are credit derivatives. For example, a CDO made up of loans is merely a securitizing of loans that is then tranched based on its credit rating. This particular securitization is known as a collateralized loan obligation (CLO) and the investor receives the cash flow that accompanies the paying of the debtor to the creditor. Essentially, a CDO is held up by a pool of assets that generate cash.  A CDO only becomes a derivative when it is used in conjunction with credit default swaps (CDS), in which case it becomes a [[Synthetic CDO]]. The main difference between CDOs and derivatives is that a derivative is essentially a bilateral agreement in which the payout occurs during a specific event which is tied to the underlying asset.

Other more complicated CDOs have been developed where each underlying credit risk is itself a CDO [[tranche]]. These CDOs are commonly known as CDOs-squared.

== Pricing ==
Pricing of credit derivative is not an easy process.&lt;ref name = "Secret Liens"&gt;Michael Simkovic, [http://ssrn.com/abstract=1323190 "Secret Liens and the Financial Crisis of 2008"], American Bankruptcy Law Journal 2009&lt;/ref&gt; This is because:
* The complexity in monitoring the market price of the underlying credit obligation.
* Understanding the creditworthiness of a debtor is often a cumbersome task as it is not easily quantifiable.
* The incidence of default is not a frequent phenomenon and makes it difficult for the investors to find the empirical data of a solvent company with respect to default.
* Even though one can take help of different ratings published by ranking agencies but often these ratings will be different.

== Risks ==
Risks involving credit derivatives are a concern among regulators of financial markets.  The [[US Federal Reserve]] issued several statements in the Fall of 2005 about these risks, and highlighted the growing backlog of confirmations for credit derivatives trades.  These backlogs pose risks to the market (both in theory and in all likelihood), and they exacerbate other risks in the financial system.&lt;ref name="Secret Liens" /&gt;   One challenge in [[regulation|regulating]] these and other derivatives is that the people who know most about them also typically have a vested [[incentive]] in encouraging their growth and lack of regulation. Incentive may be indirect, e.g., academics have not only consulting incentives, but also incentives in keeping open doors for research.

The '''Cypriot Nationality Laws''' dates back to 1967. It is mainly based on ''[[jus sanguinis]]''.

==Acquisition of Cypriot citizenship==

There are several ways to become a Cypriot citizen (citizen of The [[Republic of Cyprus]]) :

===Marriage to a Cypriot National===

The first, being married to a Cypriot national, requires one to be married for at least 3 years, and have completed 2 years of residency in Cyprus prior to the date of the application. 

In the case where the Cypriot national is living abroad, the applicant must either have been married to the Cypriot national for 3 years and submit an accompanying letter explaining why citizenship is desired, or have been married to the Cypriot national for 5 years and have at least one child (in which case an accompanying letter is not required). &lt;ref&gt;http://www.moi.gov.cy/moi/crmd/crmd.nsf/All/60D513972DB4D3ADC2257D1E00333668?OpenDocument&lt;/ref&gt;

The documents required are: 
*Birth certificate of the applicant 
*Certificate of clean criminal record of the applicant
*Marriage certificate
*Birth certificate of the couple’s children 
*Certificate of acquisition of the Cypriot citizenship of the Cypriot spouse (where applicable)
*Statement of harmonious cohabitation signed before an Officer of the District Administration Office or the diplomatic authority 
*Statement of cohabitation from the local authority
*The application should be submitted in duplicate and one of the two application forms should bear two stamps worth 8.54 euros.
*Photocopy of receipt for the amount of 300 euros paid as fees &lt;ref&gt;http://www.moi.gov.cy/moi/crmd/crmd.nsf/All/2DC0A53CB22ADF38C22578E300362B51?OpenDocument&lt;/ref&gt;

===Having Cypriot Origins===

To apply through this method, one must be over 18 years old, and naturally, have Cypriot origins, as long as one was born abroad after the 16th of August 1960, with one's parent at the time of birth a Cypriot citizen. One can apply in this way if one is an individual born after the 11th of June 1999, whose mother was a Cypriot citizen at the time of one's birth.&lt;ref name="moi.gov.cy"&gt;http://www.moi.gov.cy/moi/crmd/crmd.nsf/All/1B47E1C815108698C22578E30035ECD1?OpenDocument&lt;/ref&gt;

Accompanying the application must be:

*Birth certificate of the applicant
*	Marriage certificate of the applicant's parents
*	Photocopy of the applicant's and the applicant's parents' passports 
*	Certificate of registration of the Cypriot parent (where applicable)
*	Copy of proof of fees paid 20 euros
*	Stamp worth 8.54 euros attached to the application &lt;ref name="moi.gov.cy"/&gt;

=== Naturalization / Citizenship by Investment ===

[[Naturalisation|Naturalization]] is referred to as the process for which a non-citizen of a country, in this case Cyprus, may become a citizen of that country. The process may be done via a statute or an application to the relevant authorities. 

In March 2014, the Cyprus Council of Ministers revised the "Scheme for Naturalization of Investors in Cyprus by Exception" as part of the government's attempts to attract foreign investors to the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.moi.gov.cy/moi/moi.nsf/All/36DB428D50A58C00C2257C1B00218CAB|title=Grant of the Cypriot citizenship to non–Cypriot entrepreneurs/ investors through the "Scheme for Naturalization of Investors in Cyprus by exception|last=|first=|date=|website=Ministry of Interior|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of these attempts included a [http://cyprusface.com/cypriot-citizenship-by-investment/ citizenship-by-investment program] that granted applicants the right to live, work and study in Cyprus and in the European Union.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.henleyglobal.com/citizenship-cyprus-citizenship/|title=Citizenship-by-Investment in Cyprus - Henley &amp; Partners|website=www.henleyglobal.com|access-date=2016-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 13th, 2016 Council of Ministers of Cyprus approved a new program of financial criteria for investors wishing to obtain citizenship of Cyprus&lt;ref&gt;[https://vizus-property.com/page/citizenship-for-investors---text-of-the-law  Cyprus Citizenship for Investors - Text of the Law{{ref-en}}]&lt;/ref&gt;.
Applicants applying for Cypriot citizenship through this citizenship-by-investment option must actively invest in the Cyprus economy, by primarily purchasing real estate at a minimum value of 2m Euro which must be held for at least 3 years, thereafter the property may be sold however they must maintain a property of at least 500,000 Euro indefinitely. Citizenship by investment includes the main applicant and his her spouse and unmarried dependents aged 27 and under. The main applicants parents can also be added for an additional investment of 500,000 Euro.

Following recent amendments to procedures, citizenship is now only approved after 6 months rather than 3 months as before.
 
Popular cities for real estate investment are as follows: (April 2017)

*Limassol
*Pafos
*Agia Napa
*Larnaca

Pafos and Agia Napa are tourism town and populations fluctuates dramatically between summer and winter seasons.

Three large Marina projects have now been given the go-ahead: Each set to regenerate their respective areas and therefore offer citizenship investors new options.

1. Limassol Marina - 100% constructed (Aug 2017)
2. Ayia Napa Marina - 70% complete (Nov 2018) with a completion date set for 2019
3. Pafos Marina - Not started as yes. Funding remains an obstacle and may mean the project could be rescaled downwards.

=== New baby born ===

According to the Republic of Cyprus Citizenship Law of 1967, anyone born on or after 16 August 1960, and with at least one parent being a Cypriot citizen, automatically acquires Cypriot citizenship.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cyprusembassy.net/home/index.php?module=page&amp;cid=111|title=Official Website of the Embassy of the Republic of Cyprus in Washington D.C.|website=www.cyprusembassy.net|access-date=2016-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Those who were born between 16 August 1960 and 1999 to a Cypriot mother abroad however, do not automatically become citizens of Cyprus, but they may register after they turn 21 years old.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dualcitizenship.com/countries/cyprus.html|title=Dual Citizenship Cyprus|website=www.dualcitizenship.com|access-date=2016-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dual citizenship==

Cyprus allows its citizens to hold foreign citizenship in addition to their Cypriot citizenship. Some countries, however, do not permit multiple citizenship e.g. adults who acquired Cypriot and [[Japanese citizenship]] by birth must declare, to the latter's [[Ministry of Justice (Japan)|Ministry of Justice]], before turning 22, which citizenship they want to keep.

==Citizenship of the Commonwealth of Nations==

Cypriot citizens are also [[Commonwealth citizen]]s as well.

==Citizenship of the European Union==

Because Cyprus forms part of the [[European Union]], Cypriot citizens are also [[citizenship of the European Union|citizens of the European Union]] under [[European Union law]] and thus enjoy [[Freedom of movement for workers#Transitional provisions in new member states|rights of free movement]] and [[Cyprus (European Parliament constituency)|have the right to vote]] in [[Elections in the European Union|elections]] for the [[European Parliament]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://europa.eu/about-eu/countries/member-countries/cyprus/index_en.htm | title=Cyprus | publisher=European Union | accessdate=4 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; When in a non-EU country where there is no Cypriot embassy, Cypriot citizens have the right to get consular protection from the embassy of any other EU country present in that country.&lt;ref&gt;Article 20(2)(c) of the [[s:Consolidated version of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union/Part Two: Non-Discrimination and Citizenship of the Union#Article 20|Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Citizenship_of_the_European_Union#Stated_rights|Rights abroad: Right to consular protection]]: a right to protection by the diplomatic or consular authorities of other Member States when in a non-EU Member State, if there are no diplomatic or consular authorities from the citizen's own state (Article 23): this is due to the fact that not all member states maintain embassies in every country in the world (14 countries have only one embassy from an EU state). [[Antigua and Barbuda]] (UK), [[Barbados]] (UK), [[Belize]] (UK), [[Central African Republic]] (France), [[Comoros]] (France), [[Gambia]] (UK), [[Guyana]] (UK), [[Liberia]] (Germany), [[Saint Vincent and the Grenadines]] (UK), [[San Marino]] (Italy), [[São Tomé and Príncipe]] (Portugal), [[Solomon Islands]] (UK), [[Timor-Leste]] (Portugal), [[Vanuatu]] (France)&lt;/ref&gt; Cypriot citizens can live and work in any country within the EU as a result of the right of free movement and residence granted in [[Treaties of the European Union|Article 21 of the EU Treaty]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:C:2008:115:0047:0199:EN:PDF |format=PDF|title=Treaty on the Function of the European Union  (consolidated version)|publisher=Eur-lex.europa.eu|accessdate=2015-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Travel freedom of Cypriot citizens==

{{Main| Visa requirements for Cypriot citizens}}
[[File: Visa requirements for Cypriot citizens.png|450px|thumbnail|[[Visa requirements for Cypriot citizens]]]]

[[Visa requirements for Cypriot citizens]] are administrative entry restrictions by the authorities of other states placed on citizens of [[Cyprus]]. In As of May 2018, Cypriot citizens had visa-free or visa on arrival access to 171 countries and territories, ranking the Cypriot passport 14th in terms of travel freedom according to the [[Visa (document)#Visa restrictions|Henley visa restrictions index]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Global Ranking - Visa Restriction Index 2017|url=https://www.henleyglobal.com/files/download/HPI2018/PI%202018%20INFOGRAPHS%20GLOBAL%20180518.pdf|publisher=Henley &amp; Partners|accessdate=22 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017, the Cypriot nationality is ranked twenty-fourth in the [[The Quality of Nationality Index|Nationality Index]] (QNI). This index differs from the [[Visa (document)#Visa restrictions|Visa Restrictions Index]], which focuses on external factors including travel freedom. The QNI considers, in addition to travel freedom, on internal factors such as peace &amp; stability, economic strength, and human development as well. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.businessinsider.de/nationalities-with-the-best-quality-of-life-2016-6?r=UK&amp;IR=T |title= The 41 nationalities with the best quality of life |date= 2016-02-06 |website=  www.businessinsider.de |access-date= 2018-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Disownment''' occurs when a parent renounces or no longer accepts a [[offspring|child]] as a family member. It differs from giving a child up for [[adoption]]. It is a [[social]] and [[interpersonal]] act and usually takes place later in the child's life. Among other things, it implies no responsibility for future care, making it similar to [[divorce]] or [[Repudiation (marriage)|repudiation]] (of a spouse). Disownment may entail [[disinherit]]ance, familial [[exile]], or [[shunning]], and often all three. 

Disownment is often [[taboo]]. In many countries it is a form of [[child abandonment]] and is illegal when the child is a minor. 

In rare cases, a society and its institutions will accept an act of disownment.  For example, the British politician [[Leo Amery#Personal life|Leo Amery]] had two adult sons, both young adults at the time of World War II; one fought in the British forces, while the other, [[John Amery]], cast his lot with [[Nazi Germany]] and beamed propaganda radio broadcasts to his homeland.  After the end of the war in 1945, young Amery was tried and executed for [[treason]], whereupon the bereaved father asked, and received, permission from the editors of ''[[Who's Who (UK)|Who's Who]]'' to change the terms of his authorized biography from two sons to "one son".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.xreferplus.com/entry.jsp?xrefid=6124794 AMERY, Rt Hon.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8049">'''Ecologically sustainable development''' is the environmental component of [[sustainable development]]. It can be achieved partially through the use of the [[precautionary principle]]; if there are threats of serious or irreversible environmental damage, lack of full scientific certainty should not be used as a reason for postponing measures to prevent [[environmental degradation]].
Also important is the principle of [[intergenerational equity]]; the present generation should ensure that the health, diversity and productivity of the environment is maintained or enhanced for the benefit of future generations. In order for this movement to flourish, environmental factors should be more heavily weighed in the valuation of assets and services to provide more incentive for the conservation of biological diversity and ecological integrity.

==Political considerations==
Effective political support is necessary for ecologically sustainable development. The mobilization of governments can be translated into action plans that are crucial to [[Sustainable development#Politics|sustainable development]]. Development efforts can be influenced by patterns of family arrangements, work attitudes, [[Morality|social morality]]—particularly interpersonal responsibilities, hierarchy of authority, quality of scientific education and implementation, and degree of domestic stability—especially, freedom from [[social conflict]].&lt;ref&gt;Bakari, Mohamed El-Kamel. "Globalization and Sustainable Development: False Twins?." New Global Studies 7.3: 23-56. ISSN (Online) 1940-0004, ISSN (Print) 2194-6566, DOI: 10.1515/ngs-2013-021, November 2013&lt;/ref&gt; National policy and development planning requires three conditions to permit ecological [[sustainability]]: action-oriented values to which individuals are committed, political authorities that favour long-term ecological benefits over immediate economic gains, and a policy with a politically competent [[constituency]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Caldwell|first=Lynton K.|title=Political Aspects of Ecologically Sustainable Development|journal=Environmental Conservation|year=1984|volume=11|issue=04|pages=299–308|doi=10.1017/S037689290001465X|url=http://journals.cambridge.org/article_S037689290001465X|accessdate=3 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Canada has taken an evidence based approach to sustainability development by using Environmental [[Sustainability measurement|Sustainability Indicators]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.ec.gc.ca/indicateurs-indicators/default.asp?lang=En&amp;n=47F48106-1 |title=Environmental Sustainability Indicators |author=Government of Canada|accessdate=7 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; as guiding tool for policy development. At the municipal level, many cities also use evidence based indicators&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.surrey.ca/community/3568.aspx |title=Sustainability Charter|author=City of Surrey|accessdate=7 May 2016}}

==Forums for ecologically sustainable development==
The World Conservation Strategy was published in 1980, becoming one of the most encouraging developments that uses a goal-oriented programme for political change concerning ecological sustainability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Allen|first=Robert P.|title=How to Save the World: Strategy for World Conservation|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QwghAQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PP1|year=1980|publisher=Barnes and Noble Books|isbn=978-0-389-20011-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The publication marked a fundamental policy shift for the global [[conservation movement]]. The traditional focus became cure rather than [[Prevention Science|Prevention]], confirming the growing trend on the assimilation of preservation and development aims that are key to an ecologically sustainable society. Specifically, the concentration on [[wildlife conservation]] drifted into a concern for wider strains degrading the natural environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=McCormick|first=John|title=The Origins of the World Conservation Strategy|journal=Environmental Review|year=1986|volume=10|issue=3|pages=177–187|jstor=3984544}}&lt;/ref&gt;
It promotes the principles of sustainable development and addresses the environmental concerns introduced by [[economic development]] decisions with a format that targets a wide audience. There are three chief conservation objectives:
#Maintaining essential [[biogeochemical cycle]]s and life-support systems
#Preserving [[genetic diversity]]
#Establishing a sustainable use of [[species]] and [[ecosystem]]s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Smith|first=Susan L.|title=Ecologically Sustainable Development: Integrating Economics, Ecology, and Law|journal=Willamette Law Review|year=1995|volume=31|issue=2|pages=261–306|url=https://litigation-essentials.lexisnexis.com/webcd/app?action=DocumentDisplay&amp;crawlid=1&amp;doctype=cite&amp;docid=31+Willamette+L.+Rev.+261&amp;srctype=smi&amp;srcid=3B15&amp;key=118207f62b4908b2ee0eb7a21f829a93|accessdate=29 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Other efforts such as the World Campaign for the Biosphere present environmental obstacles constantly before governmental and scientific authorities. Nicholas Polunin, former president of the Foundation for Environmental Conservation, believed the starting point for the World Campaign effort occurred in 1966 at an [[UNESCO]] conference in Finland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Polunin|first=Nicholas|title=Our Global Environment and the World Campaign for the Biosphere|journal=Environmental Conservation|year=1982|volume=9|issue=02|pages=115|doi=10.1017/S0376892900020002}}&lt;!--|accessdate=4 April 2013--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;  The conference examined conditions that hinder ecologically sustainable development such as rapid [[population growth]], proliferation of [[nuclear weapon]]s, and depletion of [[natural resource]]s. Similarly, the [[The Global 2000 Report to the President|Global 2000 Report to the President]], presents environmental prospective conditions that are likely to worsen if public policies, institutions, and rates of technologic advancement do not change. Findings of this type prompted [[environmentalist]]s and the Foundation for Environmental Conservation to initiate the World Campaign project and have included the following suggestions:
:*Publication and broadcast of [[environmental issue]]s
:*Use of traditional [[Media (communication)|communication mediums]] such as posters and automobile stickers
:*Distribution of increasing basic and applied environmental research results
:*Information about [[family planning]] and the necessity to control population growth
:*Designating more area as [[national park]]s or [[wilderness area]]s, including the ocean
:*Organization of local, state, national, and international conferences to discuss environmental issues
:*Encouraging sustainable uses of our natural resources
:*Establishment of [[common law]]s for the Earth and mankind
:*Obtaining support form [[nongovernmental organization]]s and [[institution]]s for the World Campaign
:*Attaining recognition such as "Guardians of the Biosphere Awards," for persons and/or groups that demonstrate actions to preserve the environment&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Barman|first=Charles R.|title=The World Campaign for the Biosphere|journal=The American Biology Teacher|volume=46|issue=5|pages=269–271|doi=10.2307/4447840|jstor=4447840}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Fraudulent Conveyances Act 1571''' (13 Eliz 1, c 5), also known as the '''Statute of 13 Elizabeth''', was an Act of Parliament in England, which laid the foundations for fraudulent transactions to be unwound when a person had gone [[insolvent]] or [[bankrupt]]. The provisions contained in the 1571 Act were replaced by Part IX of the [[Law of Property Act 1925]], which has since been replaced by Part XVI of the [[Insolvency Act 1986]].&lt;ref name="Fraud1"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Baird|first1=Douglas|last2=Thomas|first2=Jackson|title=Fraudulent Conveyance Law and Its Proper Domain|journal=Vanderbilt Law Review|date=1985|volume=38|issue=829|url=http://chicagounbound.uchicago.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2046&amp;context=journal_articles|accessdate=10 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Text==
{{Cquote|For the avoiding of feigned, covinous and fraudulent [[feoffment]]s, gifts, grants, alienations, bonds, suits, judgments and executions, as well of lands and in tenements, as of goods and chattels, more commonly used and practised in these days than hath been seen or heard of heretofore; which feoffments, gifts, grants etc have been and are devised and contrived of malice, fraud, covin, collusion or guile to the end, purpose and intent to delay, hinder or defraud creditors and others of their just and lawful actions, suits, debts, etc; not only to the let or hindrance of the due course and execution of law and justice, but also to the overthrow of all true and plain dealing, bargaining and chevisance between man and man, without the which no [[commonwealth]] or civil society can be maintained or continued.

It is clear from the text of the statute that it was framed in a purposive manner. So if someone had the intention of defrauding a creditor, unless a transaction was made ''bona fide'' and for good consideration, it would be void.&lt;ref name="Fraud1"/&gt;

==Historical background==
In 1571, Parliament enacted this statute to prohibit transfers intended to defraud creditors or impede their collection efforts. This statute, known as the Statute of 13 Elizabeth, was passed in response to the widespread use of fraudulent transactions to defeat creditors. Until the 1600s, England had numerous sanctuaries not subject to the King's writ. These sanctuaries included churches but also certain areas defined by custom or royal grant. Debtors would often sell their property to friends or family at unreasonably low prices with the promise of buying it back later, move to a sanctuary, and then wait for creditors to exhaust their efforts or offer a favorable settlement.&lt;ref name="Fraud1"/&gt;

==Cases under the Act==
*''[[Alderson v Temple]]'' (1768) (1746-1779) 1 Black W 660, 96 ER 384, [[William Murray, 1st Earl of Mansfield|Lord Mansfield]] held the Act applied, not just to fraudulent conveyances, but also the granting of fraudulent preferences. He said a ‘fraudulent preference by a debtor, if made on the eve of, and followed by, the bankruptcy of the debtor, has been void against his creditors; because it aims at preventing that equal distribution of assets among the creditors, which has always been the object of those laws.’
*''[[Twyne's Case]]'' (1601) 3 Coke 80b, 76 ER 809 held that where a debtor tried to transfer title to property to another party but retained possession of it, that was repugnant to the Act.
*''Ideal Bedding v Holland'' [1907] 2 Ch 157, where [[Arthur Kekewich|Kekewich J]] noted that by virtue of subsequent enactments widening the potential relief available to creditors, the Act had come to apply in a wide variety of circumstances which seemed to wider than the original intended application as there was more potential for an action to constitute a hindrance upon that entitlement to relief.
*''Trustee of the property of Pehrsson (a bankrupt) v Von Greyerz'' [1999] 4 LRC 135, in one of the most recent appellate decisions on the Act, the [[Judicial Committee of the Privy Council|Privy Council]] heard an appeal relating to the At from [[Law of Gibraltar|Gibraltar]], where the Act still applies.
* ''Curtis v Price'' (1806) 12 Ves 89; 33 ER 35; [1803-13] All ER Rep 220
* ''Ryall v Rolle'' (1749) 1 Atk 165; 1 Wils 260; 1 Ves Sen 348; 9 Bli NS 377; 26 ER 107; [1558-1774] All ER Rep 82
* ''Daubeny v Cockburn'' (1816) 1 Mer 626; 35 ER 801; [1814-23] All ER Rep 604
* ''Doe d Garnons v Knight'' (1826) 5 B &amp; C 671; 8 Dow &amp; Ry KB 348; 4 LJOSKB 161; 108 ER 250; [1824-34] All ER Rep 414

==Other jurisdictions==
===United States===

Many [[U.S. state]]s enacted their own versions of the Statute of 13 Elizabeth after the [[American Revolution]].  The Act was later superseded by the Uniform Fraudulent Conveyances Act of 1918 (UFCA), which in turn was superseded by the Uniform Fraudulent Transfer Act of 1984 (UFTA).  To date, UFTA has been enacted in 43 states and the District of Columbia.&lt;ref name="Fraud1"/&gt;

Both the [[Bankruptcy Act of 1938]] and the [[Bankruptcy Reform Act of 1978]] also included their own versions of the UFCA, thus ensuring that bankruptcy trustees can "avoid" (in other words, reverse) fraudulent transfers made by the bankrupt person within a certain time window before they filed for bankruptcy.

===Commonwealth===
The laws of England were incorporated into numerous of the colonies on specified dates. In Western Canada for example, the laws of England were incorporated as the laws of the Northwest Territories (now Saskatchewan, Alberta, the Northwest Territories and Nunavut) as at 1885.  Although most former colonies have passed similar legislation, the 1571 Act may still be in effect in some jurisdictions.

It continues to be cited as an authority in legal cases,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.austlii.edu.au/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=[1936]%20AC%2085&amp;sort-order=date |title=Law Cite Search [1936] {{abbr|AC|Appeal Cases}} 85}} and {{cite web |url=http://www.austlii.edu.au/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=54%20CLR%2049&amp;sort-order=date |title=Lawcite search (1935) 54 CLR 49}}&lt;/ref&gt; and used as an example for students studying law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.victorialawfoundation.org.au/sites/default/files/resources/Dr_Grant_and_his_underpants.pdf |title=Dr Grant and his underpants |publisher=Victorian Law Foundation |year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==

In the 19th century, an action for [[negligence]] was only available if there was a particular relationship between the injured person and the person said to be negligent. The most common founding of the relationship was that of contract, but only where both people were party to the same contract, referred to as [[privity of contract]].&lt;ref name="Plunket 2015"&gt;{{cite web |last=Plunkett |first=J.C. |title=The Historical Foundations of the Duty of Care  |url=http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/journals/MonashULawRw/2015/25.html}} (2015) 41 [[Monash University Law Review]] 716.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus in ''[[Winterbottom v Wright]]'', Winterbottom had a contract with the [[Postmaster General of the United Kingdom|Postmaster-General]] to drive a mail coach, while Wright had a contract with the Postmaster-General to maintain the mail coach. Wright performed his contract negligently and a wheel fell off the coach and Winterbottom was injured. The [[Exchequer of Pleas|Court of Exchequer]] held that because Winterbottom and Wright were not parties to the same contract, such that Wright had no liability in negligence.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Winterbottom v Wright]]'' [http://www.worldlii.org/int/cases/EngR/1842/713.pdf (1842) 10 M&amp;W 109]; (1842) 152 [[English Reports|ER]] 402.&lt;/ref&gt; There was no privity of contract where goods were sold by an intermediary, or where the goods were bought on behalf of another. There were some exceptions, such as ''[[Langridge v Levy]]'' where the seller fraudulently misrepresented that the gun was safe, knowing that the gun was bought on behalf of the buyers son,&lt;ref&gt;''[[Langridge v Levy]]'' [http://www.worldlii.org/int/cases/EngR/1837/156.pdf (1837) 2 M&amp;W 519]; (1837) 150 [[English Reports|ER]] 863.&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[George v Skivington]]'' where a chemist negligently compounded a bottle of hair shampoo, knowing it was to be used by the plaintiff's wife.&lt;ref&gt;''[[George v Skivington]]'' (1869) 5 LR Ex 1, 39 LJ Ex 8&lt;/ref&gt; In 1932 the law of negligence however was radically altered by the [[Judicial functions of the House of Lords|House of Lords]] in the decision of ''[[Donoghue v Stevenson]]'',&lt;ref name="Donoghue v Stevenson"&gt;{{cite BAILII|litigants=[[Donoghue v Stevenson]] |court=UKHL |year=1932 |num=100 |parallelcite=&amp;#91;1932&amp;#93; [[Appeal Cases Law Reports|AC]] 562 |courtname=auto |date=26 May 1932}}.&lt;/ref&gt; where [[Lord Atkin]] held that the particular relationships that had hitherto been held to give rise to a [[duty of care]] were but instances of a general rule that a person owed a duty of care who ought reasonably have been contemplated as being closely and directly affected by the actions.

===Facts===

In June 1931 Dr Grant purchased two pairs of woollen underwear and two singlets from [[John Martin &amp; Co.]] There was nothing to say the underwear should be washed before wearing and Dr Grant did not do so. He suffered a skin irritation within nine hours of first wearing them. Dr Grant applied [[calamine|calamine lotion]], but continued to wear the underwear for the rest of the week. He then wore the second pair for the next week and washed the first pair. This was in an era when changing his underwear only once a week was "the ordinary custom of ordinary people".&lt;ref name="SASC"/&gt;{{rp|at p. 470}} The skin irritation got worse and developed into a severe case of [[dermatitis]]. Dr Grant blamed the underwear and sued John Martin &amp; Co. for breach of contract, being the statutory warranties that the goods were fit for the purpose and were of merchantable quality.&lt;ref name="SGA"&gt;{{cite Legislation AU|SA|num_act|soga630o58a59v1895221|Sale of Goods Act 1895}} s 14.&lt;/ref&gt; Dr Grant also sued the manufacturer, Australian Knitting Mills,&lt;ref&gt;Australian Knitting Mills was taken over by Holeproof in 1955: {{cite web|url=http://www.holeproof.com.au/About-Holeproof/Study-Centre/Our-History.asp|title=Our History|year=2003|publisher=Holeproof|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110218174451/http://holeproof.com.au/About-Holeproof/Study-Centre/Our-History.asp|archive-date=18 February 2011|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; alleging that they had been negligent in failing to take reasonable care in the preparation of the garments. The garments in question were alleged to contain an excess of sulphur compounds, variously described as sulphur dioxide and [[sulphite]]s.

===Supreme Court of South Australia===
The case was heard in the [[Supreme Court of South Australia]] before [[George John Robert Murray|Murray]] [[Chief Justice|CJ]] over 20 days in November and December 1932 .&lt;ref name="SASC"&gt;{{cite AustLII|SAStRp|3|1933|litigants=Grant v John Martin &amp; Co and Australian Knitting Mills Limited |parallelcite=[1935] [[South Australian State Reports|SASR]] 457 |date=17 February 1933 |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The issues to be determined in the case were whether the underwear caused Dr Grant's dermatitis, whether Dr Grant relied on the salesman's skill &amp; judgment, giving rise to the statutory warranty the underwear was fit for purpose,&lt;ref name="Sale of Goods Act"&gt;{{cite Legislation AU|SA|num_act|soga630o58a59v1895221|Sale of Goods Act 1895}} s14.&lt;/ref&gt; and the extent of the manufacturer's duty of care to the ultimate consumer. Murray CJ accepted evidence that the dermatitis was caused by exposure to sulphur compounds,&lt;ref name="SASC"/&gt;{{rp|at p. 463}} and that the sulphur compounds were on the underwear from the scouring, bleaching and shrinking processes.&lt;ref name="SASC"/&gt;{{rp|at p. 467–8}} Murray CJ held that the retailer was liable under the statutory warranty because Grant had asked for woollen underwear and relied on the salesman's skill in selecting the "golden fleece" brand manufactured by Australian Knitting Mills. The ''Sale of Goods Act'',&lt;ref name="Sale of Goods Act"/&gt; was founded on the existence of a contract and did not apply to the claim against the manufacturer. Murray CJ applied the landmark decision of ''Donoghue v Stevenson'',&lt;ref name="Donoghue v Stevenson"/&gt; which had been decided by the House of Lords less than 12 months previously,&lt;ref name="McAlister"&gt;cited as ''McAlister v Stevenson'' in accordance with [[Scots law]] practice which was to include both the [[married and maiden names]] of female [[litigants]]: {{citation|last=Heuston |first=R. F. V. |title=Donoghue v. Stevenson in Retrospect}} (1957) 20 [[Modern Law Review]] 1. {{DOI|10.1111/j.1468-2230.1957.tb00421.x|}}&lt;/ref&gt; holding that the manufacturer owed a duty of care to the consumer because (1) it intended the underwear would reach the consumer for wear in the same condition as when it left the manufacturer, (2) there was no reasonable possibility of testing for the presence of sulphur compounds and (3) Australian Knitting Mills knew that the absence of reasonable care in the preparation of the garments would result in an injury to the purchaser's health. The judgment does not articulate what a reasonable manufacturer would have done differently. Dr Grant was awarded £2,450 in damages.&lt;ref name="SASC"/&gt;{{rp|at p. 473}}

===High Court===

Australian Knitting Mills and John Martin &amp; Co appealed to the High Court, where the case was heard over a further 6 days. The majority, Starke, Dixon and McTiernan JJ, upheld the appeal.&lt;ref name="HCA"&gt;{{cite AustLII|HCA|35|1933|litigants=Australian Knitting Mills Ltd v Grant |parallelcite=[http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/high_ct/1933/35.pdf (1933)&amp;nbsp;50&amp;nbsp;CLR&amp;nbsp;387] |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Starke J agreed with the findings of Murray CJ that (1) the manufacturing process was the source of some of the sulphur content, but it was not possible to determine the proportion,&lt;ref name="HCA"/&gt;{{rp|at p. 406}} and (2) the dermatitis was caused by sulphur compounds in the garments.&lt;ref name="HCA"/&gt;{{rp|at p. 407}} Starke J however upheld the appeal, finding that Australian Knitting Mills was not negligent as it adopted a process that was prudent and reasonable.&lt;ref name="HCA"/&gt;{{rp|at p. 409}} Starke J held that it was unreasonable to expect James Martin &amp; Co to exercise skill and judgement that the goods were free from irritant chemicals when they had no means of detecting the sulphur compounds.&lt;ref name="HCA"/&gt;{{rp|at p. 411}}

Dixon J noted that, on one view the test from ''Donoghue v Stevenson'' was limited to circumstances where the manufacturer had excluded interference with or examination of the goods, whilst the other view was that it was sufficient if the manufacturer intended the consumer to receive the article as it left the manufacturer. Dixon J did not determine which view was correct, instead holding that the evidence did not establish that the underwear had the sulphur compounds of such a strength so as to have caused Dr Grant's dermatitis.&lt;ref name="HCA"/&gt;{{rp|at p. 428}} McTiernan J, as he tended to do,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/journals/UNSWLawJl/2011/40.html |author1=Seroussi, Y |author2=Smyth, R |author3=Zukerman, I |last-author-amp=yes |title=Ghosts from the High Court's past: Evidence from computational linguistics for Dixon ghosting for McTiernan and Rich}} (2011) 34 UNSW Law Journal 984.&lt;/ref&gt; agreed with Dixon J, in this case writing a short concurring judgement.&lt;ref name="HCA"/&gt;{{rp|at p. 450}}

Evatt J dissented, holding that Dr Grant's dermatitis was caused by sulphur compounds and that the manufacturer had failed to fully or completely carry out its washing process.&lt;ref name="HCA"/&gt;{{rp|at p. 436}} Evatt J dismissed the contention that there was no "special relationship" between the manufacturer and consumer, noting that the manufacturer provided a "guarantee" to the purchaser that the garments would not shrink if washed in accordance with its directions.&lt;ref name="HCA"/&gt;{{rp|at p. 440}}

One of the issues was whether specific identified goods were goods "bought by description" within the meaning of the ''Sales of Goods Act''.&lt;ref name="SGA"/&gt; Dixon J,&lt;ref name="HCA"/&gt;{{rp|at pp. 417–8}} McTiernan J agreeing, and Evatt J,&lt;ref name="HCA"/&gt;{{rp|at p. 448}} held that because they were described by Dr Grant as woollen underclothing,  the goods were bought by description, even though he was shown specific items.

===Arguments===

The hearing before the Privy Council lasted 9 days, bringing the total hearing days to 35. Grant was represented by G.P Glanfield, argued that the manufacturer's duty was to render the garment safe, in terms reflecting a [[strict liability]] rather than a duty to take reasonable care. Australian Knitting Mills and James Martin &amp; Co were represented by [[Wilfred Greene, 1st Baron Greene|Wilfred Greene]] {{post-nominals|country=GBR-cats|KC}},&lt;ref&gt;Greene  was appointed as a [[Lord Justice of Appeal]] later that year.&lt;/ref&gt; and the Australian barrister Wilbur Ham {{post-nominals|country=AUS|KC}},&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AuDB |first=P |last=Balmford |title= Ham, Wilbur Lincoln (1883–1948) |id2=ham-wilbur-lincoln-6535 |accessdate=13 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; who had represented them before the High Court and had made the journey to London for the hearing.&lt;ref&gt;A trip that at that time typically took 42 days each way.{{cite web |url=http://www.anmm.gov.au/Learn/Library-and-Research/Research-Guides/Passenger-Ships-to-Australia-A-Comparison-of-Vessels-and-Journey-Time |title=Passenger Ships to Australia: A Comparison of Vessels and Journey Times |publisher=Australian Maritime Museum |access-date=13 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The headnote writer in the authorised reports of ''Donoguhue v Stevenson'' expressed the duty of care as being confined to ‘the manufacturer of an article of food, medicine or the like’,&lt;ref&gt;''[[Donoghue v Stevenson]]'' &amp;#91;1932&amp;#93; [[Appeal Cases Law Reports|AC]] 562.&lt;/ref&gt; an argument that was adopted for Australian Knitting Mills in seeking to distinguish the case from one in which an item of clothing was to be worn externally. The other way in which they sought to distinguish ''Donoghue v Stevenson'' the sealed bottle intentionally excluded interference with or examination of the ginger beer before it reached the consumer, whereas the clothing bought by Dr Gran "might be handled and inspected by others before reaching the" consumer.&lt;ref name=PC/&gt;{{rp|[[Appeal Cases Law Reports|AC]] at p. 89}}

==Privy Council==

At the time there was no provision for dissent or separate judgments in the [[Judicial Committee of the Privy Council|Privy Council]]. Instead the advice to the King was determined by a majority of judges who heard the appeal and one judge would be chosen to write the judgment. Decisions of the Privy Council tended to be expressed on narrow grounds, a tendency attributed to the need to reflect the agreement of the majority of judges.&lt;ref name="Gleeson 2008"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hcourt.gov.au/assets/publications/speeches/former-justices/gleesoncj/cj_18jun08.pdf |title=The Privy Council – An Australian Perspective |author=Gleeson, M |author-link=Murray Gleeson |date=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lord Wright delivered the judgment of the Privy Council and identified the aspects of the decision in ''Donoghue v Stevenson'' in which the majority, [[William Watson, Baron Thankerton|Lord Thankerton]], [[Hugh Macmillan, Baron Macmillan|Lord Macmillan]] and Lord Atkin had agreed,&lt;ref name=PC/&gt;{{rp|CLR at p. 63}} as being the statement by Lord Atkin that: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;A manufacturer of products, which he sells in such a form as to show that he intends them to reach the ultimate consumer in the form in which they left him with no reasonable possibility of intermediate examination, and with the knowledge that the absence of reasonable care in the preparation or putting up of the products will result in an injury to the consumer's life or property, owes a duty to the consumer to take that reasonable care.&lt;ref name="Donoghue v Stevenson"/&gt;{{rp|at p. 599}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Privy Council rejected the attempts to distinguish ''Donoghue v Stevenson'', stating "No distinction however, can be logically drawn for this purpose between a noxious thing taken internally and a noxious thing applied externally",&lt;ref name=PC/&gt;{{rp|CLR at p. 66}} and that "The decision in ''Donoghue's Case'' did not depend on the bottle being stoppered and sealed: the essential point in this regard was that the article should reach the consumer or user subject to the same defect as it had when it
left the manufacturer."&lt;ref name=PC/&gt;{{rp|CLR at p. 67}}

The judgment took a narrow approach to its expression of the duty of care,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.supremecourt.wa.gov.au/_files/Fundamental%20Errors%20in%20Donoghue%20v%20Stevenson%20by%20Edelman%20J%20July%202014.pdf |author=Edelman, J |author-link1=James Edelman |title=Fundamental errors in Donoghue v Stevenson |year=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; limiting it to (1) manufacturers of goods,&lt;ref name=PC/&gt;{{rp|CLR at p. 66}} (2) the presence of deleterious chemicals could not be detected by any examination that could reasonably be made by the consumer,&lt;ref name=PC/&gt;{{rp|CLR at p. 66}} and (3) the risk is known to the manufacturer and unknown to the consumer.&lt;ref name=PC/&gt;{{rp|CLR at p. 65}}

An appellant who seeks to disturb a decision as to the facts must show the decision was wrong, having regard to the advantage of the tiral judge of seeing and hearing the witnesses. In this case the Privy Council was not satisfied that the trial Judge was wrong.&lt;ref name=PC/&gt;{{rp|CLR at p. 58}} In relation to the manufacturers breach of the duty, the Privy Council held that "According to the evidence, the method of manufacture was correct: The danger of excess sulphites being left was recognized and guarded against: the process was intended to be fool proof. If excess sulphites were left in the garment, that could only be because someone was at fault".&lt;ref name=PC/&gt;{{rp|CLR at p. 61–2}}

Dr Grant was held to have relied upon the skill and judgment of the retailer that the garments were fit for wearing, with the Privy Council saying: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;It is clear that the reliance must be brought home to the mind of the seller, expressly or by implication. The reliance will seldom be express: it will usually arise by implication from the circumstances: thus to take a case like that in question, of a purchase from a retailer, the reliance will be in general inferred from the fact that a buyer goes to the shop in the confidence that the tradesman has selected his stock with skill and judgment: the retailer need know nothing about the process of manufacture: it is immaterial whether he be manufacturer or not: the main inducement to deal with a good retail shop is the expectation that the tradesman will have bought the right goods of a good make: the goods sold must be, as they were in the present case, goods of a description which it is in the course of the seller's business to supply: there is no need to specify in terms the particular purpose for which the buyer requires the goods, which is none the less the particular purpose within the meaning of the section, because it is the only purpose for which any one would ordinarily want the goods. In this case the garments were naturally intended, and only intended, to be worn next the skin.&lt;ref name=PC/&gt;{{rp|CLR at p. 60}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Thus the Privy Council upheld the appeal, finding that the decision of the Supreme Court of South Australia was correct in finding that both the manufacturer, Australian Knitting Mills, and the retailer, James Martin &amp; Co, were liable to the plaintiff.&lt;ref name=PC/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://historical-debates.oireachtas.ie/S/0130/S.0130.199111140004.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120910083325/http://www.historical-debates.oireachtas.ie/S/0130/S.0130.199111140004.html |archive-date=10 September 2012 |title=Liability for Defective Products Bill, 1991: Second Stage |work=[[Seanad Éireann]] Vol. 130 |date=14 November 1991}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7741">'''Section 79''' of the U.S. [[Internal Revenue Code]] sets out the U.S. Federal income tax law concerning [[term life insurance]] plans provided by employers. Tax benefits are available for both employers and participating employees, under certain conditions.

== Section 79 plans ==
Section 79 details the tax consequences and requirements for employers wishing to install a group-term [[life insurance]] plan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fourmilab.ch/ustax/www/t26-A-1-B-II-79.html |title=Sec. 79. Group-term life insurance purchased for employees |publisher=Fourmilab.ch |date=1989-01-01 |accessdate=2012-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Permanent life insurance]] may also be offered as an added benefit in a Section 79 plan. Section 79 plans are non-qualified as defined by the Internal Revenue Code, but still offer a [[tax deduction]] for sponsoring employers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation needed|date=February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An employee must include in gross income for Federal income tax purposes an amount equal to the cost of [[Term life insurance|group-term life insurance]] coverage on the employee's life to the extent that the cost of the coverage exceeds the sum of $50,000 plus the amount (if any) paid by the employee to purchase the coverage.&lt;ref&gt;See subsection (a) of {{usc|26|79}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Contributions to a Section 79 plan are tax-deductible, though for owner(s), and 2% or more shareholders, contributions are deductible only if paid by, and from, a [[C corporation|C Corporation]].

A Section 79 benefit program may allow the following benefits.

# The ability to purchase permanent life insurance with corporate dollars
# Deduct all of the cost to the C corporation as a business expense&lt;ref group="note"&gt;policy loans and withdrawals reduce the policies cash value and death benefit and may result in a taxable event&lt;/ref&gt;
# Allow the transfer of corporate dollars to the business owner on a tax-favored basis&lt;ref group="note"&gt;although 100% deductible at the corporate level, contributions to a section 79 plan also provide an economic benefit to the owner and income tax will be required on approximately 60% of the contribution&lt;/ref&gt;
# Grow the money in the plan in a tax-deferred setting
# Access to money in the plan can be achieved through policy loans on a tax-deferred basis
# Death benefits can pass to heirs on an income tax-free basis.
# There are no regulatory limits on funding for the key participants
# May provide asset protection by removing plan assets from the reach of company creditors
# Provides for minimal{{Clarify|date=May 2012}} rank and file employee cost
# Insurance cash values may provide tax-free income as long as the policy is kept in force and withdrawals do not exceed the cost basis

A section 79 plan may be used for the following applications
# Group life insurance benefits
# Deductible insurance to fund estate planning needs of the business owner
# Deductible insurance to provide personal life insurance needs for the owner
# Deductible insurance to fund a buy-sell agreement or key man policy
# Future business buyout on a tax-advantaged basis

Death benefits can be determined by a number of different methods at the discretion of the employee: from a minimum coverage of group term insurance to a permanent benefit up to a pre-determined multiple of the employee's reported W-2 income. The tax consequences and funding commitment to the employee will be impacted by the option they choose within the plan. In the case of an employee making $245,000, if a 10× multiple is used, that employee will receive a death benefit equal to $2,450,000 ($245,000 × 10). The resulting contribution depends heavily on what product is being used for funding, as well as the employee's age and health.

==Calculating the tax liability==
In a non-discriminatory Section 79 plan, the first $50,000 of coverage is provided free to all employees. Any group coverage over this amount is deemed a benefit for which the employee must pay. The pure insurance portion is factored using the [[Internal Revenue Service]] (IRS) published Table I rates &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-irbs/irb99-25.pdf |title=IRB 1999-25 |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2012-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; (scroll to page 5). If using permanent insurance the portion calculated as the 'permanent benefit' takes into account premium(s) paid, accumulated and cash [[Cash value|surrender value]], and other policy factors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.taxalmanac.org/index.php/Treasury_Regulations%2C_Subchapter_A%2C_Sec._1.79-1 |title=A free online tax research resource and community - Treasury Regulations, Subchapter A, Sec. 1.79-1 |publisher=TaxAlmanac |date= |accessdate=2012-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Requirements==
There are generally four main conditions which must be met when installing a Section 79 plan:
# The plan must provide a death benefit excludable from income under Code section 101(a)[http://www.fourmilab.ch/ustax/www/t26-A-1-B-III-101.html]
# Must be provided to a group of employees
# Must be provided under a policy carried directly or indirectly by the employer
# Maximum death benefits for each employee based on a multiple of compensation

===Non-discriminatory===
In order for a Section 79 plan to maintain its non-discriminatory form other conditions must be met:
# Cover at least 70% of employees
# No more than 15% of the participants are key employees
# Benefits based on reasonable classifications

===Discriminatory===
It is possible to have what is deemed a discriminatory Section 79 plan. Under a discriminatory plan the first $50,000 of death benefit coverage is not free for owners and key employees. Cost will again be based on the IRS Table I rates. [[wikt:rank and file|Rank and file]] employees maintain their free benefit whether or not the plan is discriminatory.

Yet another set of requirements comes into play if the company has less than 10 employees.

===Under 10 employees===
# Employees with less than six months of full-time employment may be excluded
# Benefits must be based on a uniform percentage of compensation or coverage brackets, such that no bracket is more than 2.5 times the next lowest bracket and the lowest bracket is at least 10% of the highest bracket

===With 10 or more employees===
{{Emptysection|date=February 2013}}

===Excluded employees===
* Employees with less than 36 months of full-time employment may be excluded
* Employees under the age of 18 or over the age of 64
* Part-time or seasonal employees
* Employees covered under a union contract, provided the group term life insurance benefits were the subject of good faith bargaining
* Anyone not medically approved
* Anyone choosing to opt out

===Coverage for spouses and dependents===
The cost of employer-provided group-term life insurance on the life of an employee’s spouse or dependent, paid by the employer, is not taxable to the employee if the face amount of the coverage does not exceed $2,000. This coverage is excluded as a ''de minimis'' fringe benefit.
Some cases may allow more.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.irs.gov/govt/fslg/article/0,,id=110345,00.html |title=Notice 89-110 |publisher=Irs.gov |date=2011-08-08 |accessdate=2012-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''International Commission of Inquiry Into the 1932–1933 Famine in Ukraine''' was set up in 1984 and was initiated by the [[World Congress of Free Ukrainians]] to study and investigate the 1932-1933 Famine in Ukraine.&lt;ref name=Sundberg&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ioir.se/ukrfamine.htm|title=International Commission of Inquiry into the 1932–33 Famine in Ukraine.

The idea for the formation of an International Commission to investigate 1932-1933 [[Holodomor|Famine in Ukraine]] was suggested by [[Toronto]] lawyer V.-Yu. Danyliv at the 4th Conference of the [[World Congress of Free Ukrainians]] held in December 1983. According to the resolution the commission was to be initiated in [[New York City]] in December 1984 and headed by [[Ignat Bilinsky]].  Danyliv consulted with justice [[John Sopinka]], lawyers Pavlo Chumak, Stepan Rozsokha and the Canadian Minister for Justice. The Commission had its first meeting in May 1988 in [[Brussels]] and was chaired by Professor emeritus [[Jacob Sundberg]]. His findings were delivered to the [[United Nations|UN Under-Secretary for Human Rights]] in [[Geneva]] on May 9, and to the President of the [[Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe]] on May 10, 1990.

==Documentary evidence exhibits entered into Commission==
Documentary evidence exhibits entered into Commission presented predominantly by  [[World Congress of Free Ukrainians]], including “Harvest of Sorrow” by [[Robert Conquest]] and many other documents by same author, [[James Mace]] as also books  Ukrainian Diaspora like “Ukrainian Holocaust of 1933” by Wasyl Hryshko, “Black Deeds of Kremlin” 2 Vol by Dobrus and Pidhaynyy, V.Kubiyovych work etc.

The Commission also examined [[Douglas Tottle]]'s controversial book ''Fraud, Famine, and Fascism: the Ukrainian Genocide Myth from Hitler to Harvard'', in which he asserts that claims the [[Holodomor]] was an intentional genocide are "fraudulent", and "a creation of [[Nazism|Nazi]] propagandists".&lt;ref name="tottle"&gt;Douglas Tottle, [http://www.rationalrevolution.net/special/library/famine.htm/ "Fraud, famine, and fascism: the Ukrainian genocide myth from Hitler to Harvard"], Toronto: Progress Books, 1987. {{ISBN|0-919396-51-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tottle was invited by the commission to attend the hearings, however he ignored the request. The commission president Professor Jacob Sundberg subsequently concluded that Tottle was not alone in his enterprise to deny the famine on the basis that material included in his book could not have been available to a private person without official Soviet assistance.&lt;ref&gt;A.J.Hobbins, Daniel Boyer, ''Seeking Historical Truth: the International Commission of Inquiry into the 1932-33 Famine in the Ukraine'', Dalhousie Law Journal, 2001, Vol 24, page 166&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conclusions==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:fcomrurep.jpg|thumb|200px|{{Deletable image-caption|Sunday, 20 September 2009|date=May 2012}}]] --&gt;
[[World Congress of Free Ukrainians]] as petitioner invited a commission to find what the famine was an act of genocide.  This invitation resulted in Commission splitting into a number of separate opinions. The  Commission majority (5 out of 6) deems it plausible that the constituent elements of genocide were in existence at the time of the famine.&lt;ref&gt;Report of the Commission  p. 48 {{cite web |url=http://www.ukrainianworldcongress.org/Holodomor/Holodomor-Commission.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-09-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080910085025/http://www.ukrainianworldcongress.org/Holodomor/Holodomor-Commission.pdf |archivedate=10 September 2008 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the commission's final report, published in 1990, it reached the following conclusions:

*The famine in Ukraine took place from August–September 1932 to July 1933. The commission stated that a minimum of 4.5 million victims (while assumed Ukrainians as sole nation and inhabitants of the [[Ukrainian SSR]] &lt;ref&gt;Report of the Commission  p. 3 {{cite web |url=http://www.ukrainianworldcongress.org/Holodomor/Holodomor-Commission.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-09-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080910085025/http://www.ukrainianworldcongress.org/Holodomor/Holodomor-Commission.pdf |archivedate=10 September 2008 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;) perished with an additional three million outside the Ukrainian SSR. The responsibility of the famine was placed on the central government of the [[USSR]] which the commission concluded various Soviet authorities "carried out those measures that for 10 months occasioned a dire shortage of foodstuffs in Ukraine."&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;Report of the Commission  p. 6 {{cite web |url=http://www.ukrainianworldcongress.org/Holodomor/Holodomor-Commission.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-09-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080910085025/http://www.ukrainianworldcongress.org/Holodomor/Holodomor-Commission.pdf |archivedate=10 September 2008 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*The Commission stressed that "the policies applied to the Ukrainian people and led to the famine of 1932–33 disregard the precepts of basic morality which are binding on Soviet as on all authorities, and that the Soviet authorities must in consequence be vigorously condemned."&lt;ref&gt;Report of the Commission  p. 9 {{cite web |url=http://www.ukrainianworldcongress.org/Holodomor/Holodomor-Commission.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-09-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080910085025/http://www.ukrainianworldcongress.org/Holodomor/Holodomor-Commission.pdf |archivedate=10 September 2008 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*A majority of the commission does not believe that the 1932–1933 famine was systematically organized to crush the Ukrainian nation once and for all. However, they concluded that Soviet authorities used the famine voluntarily, when it happened, "to crown {{sic|they}} new policy of denationalization." &lt;ref name="ReferenceC"&gt;Report of the Commission  p. 5 {{cite web |url=http://www.ukrainianworldcongress.org/Holodomor/Holodomor-Commission.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-09-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080910085025/http://www.ukrainianworldcongress.org/Holodomor/Holodomor-Commission.pdf |archivedate=10 September 2008 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*The commission majority was unable to affirm the existence of a preconceived plan to organize a famine in Ukraine, in order to ensure the success of Moscow’s policy. However, the commission majority did conclude that Soviet authorities, without actively wanting the famine, most likely took advantage of it to force peasants to accept policies they strongly opposed.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt;

The final report was also published in Russian: The International Commission of Inquiry famine in Ukraine years 1932-1933 Final Report in 1990, Kiev - 1992 (Международная комиссия по расследованию голода на Украине 1932—1933 годов Итоговый отчёт 1990 г., Киев −1992).

The only dissenting opinion came from Professor Sundberg, who concluded that:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"the evidence shows that the famine situation was well-known in Moscow from the bottom to the top. Very little or nothing was done to provide some relief to the starving masses. On the contrary, a great deal was done to deny the famine, to make it invisible to visitors, and to prevent relief being brought.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The '''Lacey Act of 1900''', or simply the '''Lacey Act''' ({{UnitedStatesCode|16|3371|3378}}) is a [[Conservation movement|conservation law]] in the [[United States]] that prohibits trade in wildlife, fish, and plants that have been illegally taken, possessed, transported, or sold.

Introduced into [[United States Congress|Congress]] by [[United States House of Representatives|Rep.]] [[John F. Lacey]], an [[Iowa]] Republican, the Act was signed into law by President [[William McKinley]] on May 25, 1900. It protects both plants and wildlife by creating civil and criminal penalties for those who violate the rules and regulations. The law authorizes the [[United States Secretary of the Interior|Secretary of the Interior]] to aid in restoring game and birds in parts of the U.S. where they have become extinct or rare. It also regulates introduction of birds and other animals to places where they have never existed before.&lt;ref name="envirohistorytimeline.wikispaces.com"&gt;"[http://envirohistorytimeline.wikispaces.com/1900+Lacey+Act+ 1900 Lacey Act]&lt;/ref&gt; 

The law is still in effect and has been amended several times.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.fws.gov/pacific/news/2000/2000-98.htm Nation marks Lacey Act centennial, 100 years of federal wildlife law enforcement]". [[US Fish and Wildlife Service]]. Retrieved on July 7, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Motivation==
In 1900, illegal commercial hunting threatened many [[Game (meat)|game]] species in the [[United States]]. The original Act was directed at the preservation of game and wild birds, making it a federal crime to poach game in one state with the purpose of selling the bounty in another. The law prohibited the transportation of [[poaching|illegally captured]] or prohibited animals [[Commerce Clause|across state lines]], and addressed potential problems caused by the introduction of non-native species of birds and animals into native ecosystems.&lt;ref&gt;Wisch, Rebecca F. "[http://www.animallaw.info/articles/ovuslaceyact.htm Overview of the Lacey Act (16 U.S.C. SS 3371-3378)]". [[Michigan State University College of Law]] Animal Legal &amp; Historical Web Center. Retrieved on July 7, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, the Lacey Act is used primarily to prevent the importation or spread of potentially dangerous [[invasive species|non-native species]]. The Act also makes it unlawful to import, export, transport, sell, receive, acquire, or purchase in interstate or foreign commerce any plant in violation of the laws of the United States, a state, a [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American tribe]], or any foreign law that protects plants.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.ncbfaa.org/Scripts/4Disapi.dll/4DCGI/cms/review.html?Action=CMS_Document&amp;DocID=11480&amp;MenuKey=pubs Background Information: The Lacey Act Amendments in the Farm Bill]". The National Customs Brokers &amp; Forwarders Association of America, Inc. Retrieved on July 7, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Amendments==
The Lacey Act was amended on May 22, 2008, when the [[Food, Conservation, and Energy Act of 2008]] expanded its protection to a broader range of plants and plant products (Section 8204. Prevention of [[Illegal logging|Illegal Logging]] Practices),&lt;ref&gt;Khatchadourian, Rafi. (October 6, 2008.)

The legal system of [[Ukraine]] is based on the framework of [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]], and belongs to the Romano-Germanic legal tradition. The main source of legal information is codified law. [[Customary law]] and [[case law]] are not as common, though case law is often used in support of the written law, as in many other legal systems. Historically, the Ukrainian legal system is primarily influenced by the French [[Code Civil|civil code]], [[Roman Law]], and traditional Ukrainian customary law.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}} The new civil law books (enacted in 2004) were heavily influenced by the German [[Bürgerliches Gesetzbuch]] .{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}

The primary law making body is the [[Verkhovna Rada|Ukrainian Parliament]] (''Verkhovna Rada''), also referred to as the legislature ({{lang-uk|законодавча влада|translit=zakonodavcha vlada}}). The power to make laws can be delegated to lower governments or specific organs of the State, but only for a prescribed purpose. In recent years, it has become common for the legislature to create "framework laws" and delegate the creation of detailed rules to ministers or lower governments (e.g. a province or municipality).{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} After laws are published in [[Holos Ukrayiny]] they come into force officially the next day.&lt;ref&gt;{{uk icon}} [http://pda.pravda.com.ua/news/id_7068453/ Laws discommunization and status OUN and UPA published in "Holos Ukrayiny"], [[Ukrayinska Pravda]] (20 May 2015)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Politics of Ukraine|Ukrainian politicians]] and analysts have described the system of justice in Ukraine as "rotten to the core".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kyivpost.com/news/business/bus_focus/detail/62565/ Moskal: ‘Rotten to the core’], [[Kyiv Post]] (March 25, 2010)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kyivpost.com/news/nation/detail/62564/ Jackpot], [[Kyiv Post]] (March 25, 2010)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Areas==
Ukrainian law is commonly divided into [[Public law]], [[Private law]], and [[International law]].These areas of the legal system are further subdivided into [[Civil law (legal system)|Civil law]] (including [[Family law]], [[Inheritance law]], [[Contract law]] and [[Commercial law]], [[Law of Obligations]], [[Property law]], [[Intellectual property law]], [[Companies law]], [[Land law]], and [[Tort law]]),  [[Criminal law]], [[Constitutional law]] (including laws on the structure of the state), [[Administrative law]], and [[International law]].

===Civil law===
[[Civil law (legal system)|Civil law]] regulates the everyday life of citizens and other legal entities, such as corporations. The main code of Ukrainian civil law is the Civil Code of Ukraine. It comprises provisions governing ownership, intellectual property rights, contracts, torts, obligations, inheritance law, and the definition of legal entities. The code introduces new types of business contracts into the legal practice, including factoring, [[franchising]], rent service, and inherited contracts. Civil litigation is governed by the Civil Procedural Code of Ukraine.

===Criminal law===
[[Criminal law]] deals with the prosecution and punishment of criminal offenses. The Criminal Code of Ukraine contains the written criminal laws of Ukraine. There is no [[capital punishment]] in Ukraine. The maximum [[criminal punishment]] is [[life imprisonment]], which can be reduced by decree of the [[President of Ukraine]] to 25 years of imprisonment, but only after 20 years of sentence service. The Parliament of Ukraine has the power of [[amnesty]] for prisoners not serving life sentences.{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}} Criminal proceedings, investigation, and court examination in criminal trials are regulated by The Criminal Procedural Code of Ukraine, which was not changed since 1962 when Ukraine was a republic of the Soviet Union till the [[Ukrainian Parliament]] passed the new Code of Criminal Procedure in April 2012.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kyivpost.com/news/politics/detail/113202/ Yanukovych mum about Tymoshenko], [[Kyiv Post]] (September 20, 2011)&lt;br&gt;[http://ukrainianweek.com/Politics/48278 Criminal-Political Code], [[The Ukrainian Week]] (3 May 2012)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Constitutional law===
[[Constitutional law]] frames the constitution and the structure of Ukraine. It regulates the powers of democratic institutions, the organization of elections and the division of power between central and local government. See also the article on the [[Constitution of Ukraine]]. Only the Constitutional Court of Ukraine is allowed to determine the constitutionality of laws created by the legislature.

===Administrative law===
[[Administrative law]] is the area of law that regulates the operation of the various levels of Ukrainian Government, including the process for people and legal entities to appeal decisions by the government. This code is referred to as the Administrative Code of Ukraine.

===International law===
[[International law]], also referred to as  the Law of Nations, involves the application of international laws in Ukraine. International agreements, ratified by the Parliament of Ukraine, are a part of Ukrainian legislation. The Constitution of Ukraine allows the direct application of most international laws in Ukrainian courts. If an international agreement of Ukraine prescribes rules other than those set by the Law of Ukraine, the rules of that international agreement shall apply. Laws regulating jurisdiction with an international aspect, such as  because parties come from different countries, are not part of international law, but form a specific branch of civil law.

On September 2005, the Law of Ukraine on [[Private International Law]] was enacted.{{citation needed|date=October 2011}} The Law sets the procedure for the regulation of private legal relations which are subject to other legal systems in addition to that of Ukraine.

===Commercial law===
The Commercial Code of Ukraine describes the details for compliance with the Constitution of Ukraine's clauses for commercial activity. The Code regulates the fundamentals of commercial activity, including business entities, property basis, responsibility for violations, peculiarities of legal regulation, and foreign commerce regulation.

====Types of corporations====
* TOV (Товариство з обмеженою відповідальністю, ТОВ) - Ukrainian "Limited liability company" with obligate charter capital
* PP (Приватне Підприємство, ПП) - Ukrainian "Limited liability company" without obligate charter capital
* TDV (Товариство з додатковою відповідальністю, ТДВ) - Ukrainian "Additional liability company"
* PrAT, in past ZAT (Приватне акцiонерне товариство, ПрАТ) -  Ukrainian "Private joint-stock company"
* PuAT, in past VAT (Публічне акцiонерне товариство, ПуАТ) - Ukrainian "Public joint-stock company"

===Legal liabilities===
Ukrainian legal liability includes constitutional liability, which  is imposed on President or Deputy [Member of Parliament] by the Parliament of Ukraine, criminal liability, which is imposed by local courts in the form of [[Sentence (law)|sentencing]], civil liability, which is imposed by local courts in the form of decision, administrative liability, which is imposed by administrative courts in form of decision, and disciplinary liability, which is imposed by superior officials or specially created organizations.

[[Public prosecutor]]s are imposed by regional Superior officials. Policemen are imposed by Superior officials.

==List of acts of parliament==
{{details|Laws of Ukraine}}

==Courts system==
{{main|Judiciary of Ukraine}}

Ukraine's court system is widely regarded as corrupt.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kyivpost.com/news/politics/detail/72013/ Battle looming over new law on judiciary and judge status], [[Kyiv Post]] (July 4, 2010)&lt;/ref&gt; Ukrainian judges have been arrested while taking [[bribe]]s.
&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kyivpost.com/news/nation/detail/96634/ Kyiv district court judge arrested while taking bribe], [[Kyiv Post]] (February 8, 2011)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Схема системи судів загальної юрисдикції.gif|thumb|right| Courts system of Ukraine]]

[[Courts]] in Ukraine are divided  by [[jurisdiction]] including [[constitutional court]]s, general (criminal and civil jurisdiction) courts, economic courts, and [[administrative courts]]. There is also the [[Constitutional Court of Ukraine]], the [[Supreme Court of Ukraine]], [[Appellate Court]]s (in every Region [[oblast]] of Ukraine), and [[Judicial system of Ukraine|District Court]]s in every [[city]], [[town]], or [[raion]] (which is a subdivision of oblast). As well, there is the High Administrative Court of Ukraine, Local Administrative Courts in every administrative district, usually [[oblast]], the High Commercial Court of Ukraine, Local Commercial Courts in every administrative district, usually [[oblast]], and [[Military court]] in every Appellate Court in every regional [[oblast]]. There is also the Tertiary Court created in accordance to the law "On Tertiary Court" and registered in [[Ministry of Justice]] of Ukraine.

In order to become a [[judge]] in Ukraine, one must be 25 years old. Newly inducted judges are appointed by the President of Ukraine and serve for five years. Afterwards, judges are elected for life by the Parliament of Ukraine. Judges are not elected by the citizenry as practiced in many western countries. The judicial branch of power in Ukraine is not completely independent. To detain or arrest a judge, special permission by the Parliament of Ukraine is needed. {{citation needed|date=October 2011}}

A judge shall not refer to political parties and trade unions, as well as participate in any political activity, have representative mandate, occupy any other paid posts, or do any other paid work except that which is scientific in nature, teaching or creative value. According to the law, a judge, while executing justice, shall follow the Constitution and the laws of Ukraine and shall ensure full, thorough and objective consideration of the cases adhering to the terms set by law. They are also obliged to take measures concerning prevention of unauthorized dissemination of the information the state and/or commercial entity considers secret or is confidential and became known to him/her in the process of doing official duties. Moreover, the Law requires a judge to refrain from the actions that defame a judge and may cause doubt that she/he is objective, as well as unprejudiced and independent.

The Law sets the system of guarantees of judge's professional activity which are necessary to approve unprejudiced and objective decisions. The Law guarantees to judges their personal immunity, secrecy of court decisions, legal protection, as well as material and social provision. The Law also prohibits any not envisaged by law interference in judge's activity concerning justice execution, detention or arrest of a judge without the consent of the ''Verkhovna Rada'' until bill of indictment concerning him/her is carried out by the court.

==Law schools==
Ukraine has taken steps to reform its education frameworks in consistence with the Bologna process. By the mid-2000s, Universities started granting undergraduate [[Bachelor of Laws]] degrees (about 3 years for full-time students and 4 years for part-time students) and graduate [[Master of Laws]] degrees (about 5 years for full-time students and 6 years for part-time students). In Soviet times, the only undergraduate degree (following a 10-year secondary education) was a 5-year Specialist Diploma, with a thesis requirement, usually placing it somewhere between a bachelor's and master's degree in the West. Degrees are awarded by authorities of the State Examination Board of University. The University degree gives people the right to engage in professional legal activities in Ukraine as a legal advisor. However, judges and criminal defense attorneys must take an additional state licensing exam.

==Post-graduate education==
The post-graduate system has not been reformed. Law [[academic degree]]s in Ukraine are the Candidate of Science of Jurisprudence (CSJ) and Doctor of Science of Jurisprudence (DSJ), equivalent to [[Doctor of the Science of Law]] (L.Sc.D.)
The [[Diploma]] is awarded after the successful defense of [[dissertation]] ([[thesis]]) by the [[Higher Attestation Commission]] (VAK). Full text of all defended dissertations are kept in the [[Vernadsky National Library of Ukraine]].

===Fields of study===

Scientific degrees awarded by VAK are classified into an established list of specialties, grouped into the following major sections.

*12.00.01 Theory of Law
*12.00.02 [[Constitutional Law]]
*12.00.03  [[Civil law (legal system)|Civil Law]]
*12.00.04  [[Economic law|Economic Law]]

Law offices are maintained by lawyers who register it as a [[law firm]] in the [[Ministry of Justice]], and are awarded state certification.

The Constitution of Ukraine defines an attorney's work as "securing the right for protection against accusation and provide legal assistance while considering cases in courts and other state bodies in Ukraine". In this case, the Law “On the Bar and Advocate's Activity” defines the Bar as a voluntary professional public association.

In order to defend a person charged with criminal offense, a person must be an attorney. An attorney under the Law “On the Bar and Advocate's Activity” can be a person who has higher legal education, stated by the diploma of Ukraine, or in line with the international treaties of Ukraine diploma of a foreign country, the work experience in the field of law no less than two years, fluent in the Language of the State, has passed a qualification exam, received a certificate entitling him to practice law, and taken the Ukrainian  Oath of the Attorney.

The Law determines that attorneys cannot hold a previous conviction. The Law also stipulates that the attorney cannot work in court,  a prosecutor's or state notary's office, bodies of internal affairs, security service, or state administration bodies.

In order to defend a person charged with criminal offense, an attorney must have a certificate entitling him to practice law  (issued by Regional Qualification-Disciplinary Bar Commission) or a Power of Attorney letter.
There are 25 Regional Qualifications- Disciplinary Bar Commissions in Ukraine: each in every Region ([[oblast]]) and one in the City of [[Kiev]] and the City of [[Sevastopol]].

A list of attorneys is kept and published by the  Supreme Qualification Bar Commission of the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vkka.gov.ua/index.php?page=katalogall |script-title=ru:ВИЩА КВАЛІФІКАЦІЙНА КОМІСІЯ АДВОКАТУРИ при Кабінеті Міністрів України |publisher=Vkka.gov.ua |date=2006-08-18 |accessdate=2011-11-01 |language=ru }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notaries==
[[Notary]] in Ukraine is based on the guidelines set forth by the law entitled "On Notariate". According to the law, the Notariate is a system of bodies and officials obliged to certify rights, certify facts that have legal force and perform other notary actions as stated in the law with the purpose of giving them legal force.
In Ukraine, notary operations are carried out by state notaries, private notaries or officials of executive bodies of local (village, settlement, city) councils, if there are no notaries therein. The  difference between state and private notaries is the service fees imposed  by public notaries are fixed by the state, whereas the only aspect regulated by the State in regards to private notaries is the  price floor.

Any person who considers occupation of the notary post must be a citizen of Ukraine, have higher legal education (university, academy, institute), work on probation during 6 months in a state notary office or at private notary, pass a qualification exam and receive a certificate permitting notary actions. A person with any outstanding convictions cannot be a notary by law.

The Certificate permitting notary activities may be abrogated by the Ministry of Justice of Ukraine in the following cases:
- on notary's own initiative;
- loss of Ukrainian citizenship or departure to permanent residence outside Ukraine;
- notary's non-conformity to the occupied post because of health condition preventing him from accomplishment of notary activities;
- coming into force of conviction sentence against notary.

Notaries are not allowed by law to work in courts, police, and prosecutor offices, nor represent citizens in courts or any other government offices. The major role of notaries in Ukraine is to notarize documents and contracts between persons in accordance to Civil Code of Ukraine. Every notarized document, agreement, contract, etc. is issued on numerated, special paper form, protected by security features and is registered in the  notary's records which is kept after completion in regional ([[oblast]]) archives indefinitely. A notary database is kept and accessible to public on the official website of the [[Ministry of Justice]] of Ukraine. As of 2007, about 13,000 registered notaries practice in Ukraine.

==Criminal justice system==
Criminal [[Criminal procedure|Investigations]] are carried out under official authority by law enforcement personnel
such as the [[Police]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mvs.gov.ua/mvs/control/main/en/index;jsessionid=F410EEB754842B2A0A83336CE809820A |script-title=ru:Мвс України |language=ru |publisher=Mvs.gov.ua |date= |accessdate=2011-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;  the tax police (tax militia), [[Public Procurator]]s (Public Prosecutors),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gp.gov.ua/ |script-title=ru:Генеральна прокуратура України. Офіційний інтернет-портал / Стартова сторінка |publisher=Gp.gov.ua |date=2011-10-28 |accessdate=2011-11-01 |language=ru }}&lt;/ref&gt;  and the [[Security Service of Ukraine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sbu.gov.ua/sbu/control/en/index |title=The Security Service of Ukraine |publisher=Sbu.gov.ua |date= |accessdate=2011-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Ukraine and other civil law jurisdictions, the [[jury]] holds equal power to three professional [[judge]]s. The [[jury]] and judges first consider the question of guilt. Then, if applicable, they consider the penalty to apply. Juries are only used for severe felony cases with a ten-year or higher sentence.

==Prison system==
The State Department of Ukraine for Enforcement of Sentences oversees the prison system of Ukraine.&lt;ref&gt;Detailed information is on the [http://www.kvs.gov.ua  official website] of the department.&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2007, the total prison population in Ukraine was 240,000 people out of the 48 million population.

Prisons in Ukraine are classified as pre-trial or remand prisons (SIZO), high security prisons, medium security prisons, and low security prisons.

Those who are charged with [[criminal offense]]s which entail sentencing for three years or more are arrested and held before trial in investigative isolation during the period of [[criminal investigation]] and after sentencing is moved to the prison as indicated by the courts in the sentencing decision. Bail is rarely used by courts in Ukraine.

==Identification==
In Ukraine, every person over 18 years of age must carry a [[passport]] or (for foreigners) an [[alien (law)|alien]] document. A person unable to provide passport is allowed  to be arrested and held in police custody for up to 72 hours in order to establish the identity thereof.

The '''law of carriage of goods by sea''' is a body of law that governs the rights and duties of shippers, carriers and consignees of marine cargo.&lt;ref&gt;''The Law of Carriage of Goods by Sea'' (2011) - L.Singh&lt;/ref&gt;  

Primarily concerned with '''[[cargo claim]]s''', this body of law is an aspect of [[international commercial law]] and [[maritime law]].

==Cargo claims==
{{Main|freight claim}}
[[Consignee]]s (or indeed any lawful holder of the [[bill of lading]])&lt;ref&gt;Bill of lading, or sea way bill or ship's delivery order: Carriage of Goods by Sea Act 1992 ss.1 &amp; 2&lt;/ref&gt; who wishes to make a cargo claim because their goods are substandard or have been lost or damaged at sea, typically have four options: 
* They may sue the '''seller''', the '''shipper''', or the '''carrier'''; or they may claim from their own '''insurance policy'''.
* A suit will lie against the seller if the seller has insufficient title,&lt;ref&gt; Sale of Goods Act1979 (as amended), section 12&lt;/ref&gt; or the goods are not of satisfactory quality,&lt;ref&gt; Sale of Goods Act1979 (as amended), section 14&lt;/ref&gt; or do not comply with sample&lt;ref&gt; Sale of Goods Act1979 (as amended), section 15&lt;/ref&gt; or description.&lt;ref&gt; Sale of Goods Act1979 (as amended), section 13&lt;/ref&gt;
* A suit will lie against the shipper if the goods are damaged through insufficient packing,&lt;ref&gt;Hague Visby Rules Art. IV Rule 2(n)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Goodwin v Lamport and Holt'' [1929] All ER 623&lt;/ref&gt; or if any loss is suffered through insufficient labelling.&lt;ref&gt;Hague Visby Rules Art. III&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Parsons v New Zealand Shipping'' [1901] KB 548&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Bunge v Brasil'' [2009] 2 Lloyds Rep 175  &lt;/ref&gt;
* A suit will lie against the carrier if the damage occurred aboard ship.&lt;ref&gt;Hague-Visby Rules Arts. II &amp; III&lt;/ref&gt; The carrier's [[Protection and indemnity insurance|P&amp;I Club]] cover will normally bear the cost.
* If the cargo is damaged where the shipper without fault (e.g. if the goods have been properly packed and stowed) or if the carrier is either blameless or exempted from liability&lt;ref&gt;Hague-Visby Rules Art IV&lt;/ref&gt;  (e.g. because of '[[Act of God]]' or '[[Deviation (law) |Justifiable Deviation]]'), &lt;ref&gt;''The Teutonia'' (1872) LR 4 PC 171&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Al Taha'' [1990] 2 LL R 117&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;	''Stag Line v Foscolo, Mango &amp; Co'' [1932] AC 328&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;''Scaramanga v Stamp'' (1880) 5 CPD 295&lt;/ref&gt; a cargo-owner will have to claim on his own cargo policy.
A claim having been paid, the assured's rights of claim will be [[Subrogation|subrogated]] to the insurer, who may consider proceeding against a party who has caused the damage.

A [[Ship-owner|shipowner]] may sue a [[Chartering (shipping)#Charter types|time-charterer]] or [[Chartering (shipping)|voyage-charterer]] in the event of breach of contract. For instance, if the charterer exceeds [[laytime]], [[demurrage]] will have to be paid; and if the charterer cannot comply with a [[Laytime|Notice of Readiness]] (NOR), the shipowner may [[Anticipatory repudiation|repudiate]] (cancel) the contract of carriage and claim [[damages]] for any loss.&lt;ref&gt;[[Maredelanto Compania Naviera SA v Bergbau-Handel GmbH]]|''The Mihalis Angelos''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Carriage conventions==
In most contracts of carriage the carrier has greater bargaining power than the shipper, and in the 19th century English judges developed rules to protect the weaker parties.&lt;ref&gt;''M'Andrew  v Adams'' (1834) 1 Bing NC 29&lt;/ref&gt; Beginning with the [[Hague Rules]], the various conventions set out to codify and develop such [[common law]] principles by providing an international set of basic standards to be met by the carrier, with a view to establishing a universal framework of legal rights and duties. In practice, however, the level of protection was actually reduced because of new provisions allowing the carrier to (i) limit his liability, and (ii) rely on a wide array of exemptions from liability &lt;ref&gt;...such as "[[Act of God]]", "[[Perils of the Sea]]" and "[[negligence]] in navigation or management of the ship").&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;e.g. Hague-Visby Rules Art. IV (1) &amp; (2)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Principles of the Carriage of Goods by Sea'' -Paul Todd&lt;/ref&gt; Also, whereas up until about 1885,&lt;ref&gt;''The Glenfruin'' (1885) 10 PD 103&lt;/ref&gt; the carrier's duties were deemed to be [[Strict liability|strict]], by 1905 the duty became one of "[[reasonable care]]" or "[[due diligence]]" only.&lt;ref&gt;''McFadden v Blue Star Line'' [1905] 1 KB 697&lt;/ref&gt;

The Hague Rules of 1924 effectively [[Codification (law)|codified]], albeit in a diluted form, the English common law rules to protect the cargo owner against exploitation by the carrier. Nearly 50 years later, the [[Hague-Visby Rules|Hague-Visby]] "update" made few changes, so that the newer Rules still applied only to "tackle to tackle" carriage (i.e. carriage by sea) and the [[Intermodal container|container]] revolution of the 1950s was virtually ignored. The Hague-Visby Rules both excluded cabotage carriage, and declared that deck cargo and live animals were not to be considered as "goods" (although the  [[Carriage of Goods by Sea Act 1971]] provided that cabotage, deck cargo and live animals are to be covered in English contracts). 

The enormous list of exemptions to liability in Article IV made the Rules seem biased in favour of the carrier. As a result, The United Nations produced its own Hamburg Rules which were both more modern and fairer to cargo-owners; but while these have been enthusiastically adopted by developing nations, the wealthier ship-owning nations have stuck to Hague-Visby. In 2008 the final text of the Rotterdam Rules was agreed at [[UNCITRAL]].&lt;ref&gt; UNCITRAL: United Nations Commission of International Trade Law.&lt;/ref&gt;  These Rules are very extensive, with over 90 Articles against 11 in Hague-Visby.  Although the Rotterdam Rules are up-to-date and address multimodal carriage, they have, nine years later, yet to be in force.  It now seems doubtful that the Rotterdam Rules will ever be adopted, but there is a slim possibility that a cut-down version of the Rules ("Rotterdam Lite") might find favour.

China has effectively adopted the Hague Rules. The USA, which tends to shun conventions and instead rely on homespun legislation, has its own [[statutes]]. These comprise the Carriage of Goods by Sea Act (a mildly updated version of the Hague Rules for goods in foreign commerce), and the [[Harter Act]] (for mostly domestic carriage).&lt;ref&gt;Lexolology report [https://www.lexology.com/library/detail.aspx?g=04c1704f-05cd-4dc5-89c8-bb1a921dd13b]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15287">[[File:Landfill compactor.jpg|thumb|right|300px|[[Landfill]]s are common LULUs]]
In [[land-use planning]], a '''locally unwanted land use''' ('''LULU''') is a [[land use]] that creates externality costs on those living within close proximity. These costs include potential health hazards, poor aesthetics, or reduction in home values. Such facilities with such hazards need to be created for the greater benefits that they offer society.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Social Issues in America: An Encyclopedia|last=Ciment|first=James|publisher=Business &amp; Economics|year=2015|isbn=|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Brion|first=Denis J.|title=An Essay on LULU, NIMBY, and the Problem of Distributive Justice|journal=Boston College Environmental Affairs Law Review|volume=15|issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

LULUs can include [[power plants]], [[landfill|dumps]] (landfills), [[prison]]s, [[road]]s, [[factory|factories]], [[hospital]]s and many other developments. Planning seeks to distribute and reduce the harm of LULUs by [[zoning]], [[environmental law]]s, community participation, buffer areas, clustering, dispersing and other such devices. Thus planning tries to protect property and environmental values by finding sites and operating procedures that minimize the LULU's effects.

== Types ==

* [[Landfill]]
* [[Road]]/[[Highway]]
* [[Power station]]
* [[Prison]]
* [[Hospital]]
* [[Health food store]]
* [[Luxury real estate]]

* [[Nuclear power]]
* [[Sewage treatment]]
* [[Superfund]]

== Externalities ==
An [[externality]] is something that happens as a result of a transaction that affects an uninvolved third party. LULU's present externalities in various ways, most notably those that inflict the senses: harsh smell, reduced aesthetics, noise pollution, and poor livability.
== Inequality ==
It has been suggested that a correlation exists between the location of sites considered as locally unwanted land uses and the proximity to minority populations as a result of market dynamics. That is, externalities associated with LULUs (such as poor aesthetics, lack of desirable amenities, etc.) tend to discourage high-earning buyers from moving to the area, and thus perpetuate the cycle in which low income individuals have few choices except those which happen to be in areas with LULUs such as landfills and highways. This tends to lower home values. Further, the same market forces, especially those that may discriminate against minorities, could make it so that these areas happen to be populated predominantly by minorities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Liu|first=Feng|title=Dynamics and Causation of Environmental Equity, Locally Unwanted Land Uses, and Neighborhood Changes|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s002679900057|journal=Environmental Management|language=en|volume=21|issue=5|pages=643–656|doi=10.1007/s002679900057|issn=0364-152X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout the United States, "three out of five African Americans and Latino Americans live in communities with abandoned toxic waste sites."&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Inequality: Social Class and Its Consequences|last=Eitzen|first=Stanley D.|last2=Johnston|first2=Janis E.|publisher=|year=2015|isbn=|location=|pages=|quote=|via=Google Scholar}}&lt;/ref&gt; This pattern is typically seen because of discrimination and racism throughout the infrastructure development process.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/about/nextgen/internedition/fall06/docs/transcripts/goss%20transcript.pdf|title=Transcript: The "Whole Foods Effect": A grocery's role in transforming cities|last=Goss|first=Adeline|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is becoming more and more common. What makes a LULU such as this unique is that they cause displacement, whereas a landfill, dump, roads, or prisons simply discourage home-buyers from entering the area and keep home prices low. High-end health food stores such as Whole Foods causes displacement by attracting high-earning home buyers into the area, causing rents and home prices to rise. This has been dubbed the "Whole Foods effect".&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Gentrification ==
The "Whole Foods Effect", among other amenities being added to neighborhoods in growing communities across the U.S., is one sign pointing toward the larger problem of [[gentrification]]. Gentrification is a process of renovation and revival of deteriorated urban neighborhoods.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dictionary.com/browse/gentrification?s=t|title=Gentrification|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; With this process often comes LULU's such as Whole Foods, luxury housing, etc.

=== Notable cases: [[San Francisco]] ===
San Francisco, like many other large cities in the United States, has a high cost of living. Its proximity to the [[Silicon Valley]] lends itself well to attracting high-income home buyers. As of 2013, 53% of low-income households throughout the entirety of the bay area were undergoing gentrification pressures caused by transit investment and new developments.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.citylab.com/housing/2015/08/mapping-gentrification-and-displacement-in-san-francisco/402559/|title=Mapping Gentrification and Displacement in San Francisco|last=Misra|first=Tanvi|date=|website=City Lab|publisher=The Atlantic|access-date=15 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/23/us/high-rents-elbow-latinos-from-san-franciscos-mission-district.html|title=Gentrification Spreads an Upheaval in San Francisco’s Mission District|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Boston ===
Boston has been known historically for the high-cost of living that accompanies residence there, as well as being subject to various Urban renewal projects during America's Urban Renewal era. These renewal projects often caused the displacement of Jewish and Italian immigrants as well as working class individuals in surrounding areas in its earliest years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://nextcity.org/features/view/boston-city-hall-urban-renewal-redevelopment-authority|title=Will Urban Renewal Ever End?|last=Trickey|first=Erick|date=|website=|publisher=Next City|access-date=15 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/nation/2005-04-19-gentrification_x.htm|title=Studies: Gentrification a boost for everyone|last=Hampson|first=Rick|date=|website=|publisher=USA Today|access-date=15 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Superfund ==
[[File:Love Canal (5621742089).jpg|thumb|Love Canal residents discuss revitalizing their contaminated neighborhood with Administrator Lee Thomas in September, 1985.]]
[[Superfund]], or the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980, was created to mitigate the cleanup and costs thereafter of hazardous waste sites. Superfund sites are often thought of when discussing LULUs. [[Love Canal]] was the first superfund site, established because of chemical waste that was being dumped into the canal by Hooker Electrical Company, later known as [[Hooker Chemical Company]]. The incident attracted widespread media attention and the neighborhoods surrounding Love Canal have since been destroyed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1988/08/05/nyregion/after-10-years-the-trauma-of-love-canal-continues.html|title=After 10 Years, the Trauma of Love Canal Continues|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been suggested that some of these sites tend to be located in areas that have a high number of low-income, minority residents.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://litigation-essentials.lexisnexis.com/webcd/app?action=DocumentDisplay&amp;crawlid=1&amp;doctype=cite&amp;docid=13+Temp.+Envtl.+L.+%26+Tech.+J.+57&amp;srctype=smi&amp;srcid=3B15&amp;key=e71421078b891069c24b78d381e0b868|title=Environmental Racism: The Failure of Equal Protection to Provide a Judicial Remedy and the Potential of Title VI of the 1964 Civil Rights Act|last=Gareis-Smith|first=Donna|date=1994|website=litigation-essentials.lexisnexis.com|publisher=Litigation Essentials|access-date=2016-12-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Native Americans ===
Of the 1,000+ Superfund sites in America, 25% of them (both capped and active) are situated directly on or near Native American reservations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://indiancountrymedianetwork.com/news/environment/kill-the-land-kill-the-people-there-are-532-superfund-sites-in-indian-country/|title=Kill the Land, Kill the People: There Are 532 Superfund Sites in Indian Country!|last=Hansen|first=Terri C.|date=17 June 2014|website=Indian Country Media Network|publisher=|access-date=16 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of these sites can interfere with various rituals and affect cultural objects, and create further conflict between the Government and affected tribes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://itepsrv1.itep.nau.edu/itep_course_downloads/TWRAP/15_tlefSuperfund/FedGuidanceMatl/SuperfundTribalLands_IssuesChallenges.pdf|title=Superfund on Tribal Lands: Issues, Challenges, and Solutions|last=Michelsen|first=Theresa|date=|website=|publisher=Environmental Protection Agency|access-date=16 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; As discussed in a report from the All Indian Pueblo's Office of Environmental Protection, "the Superfund HRS [Hazard Ranking System] model does not account for Indian religious and ceremonial impacts from sites. Due to their importance in Pueblo life, culturally significant plants, animals, ceremonial surface water use, and sacred areas should be considered as critical impacts when evaluating the various pathways of exposure of the HRS.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.iiirm.org/publications/Articles%20Reports%20Papers/Environmental%20Protection/superfund.pdf|title=Superfund in Indian Country: The Role of the Federal-Indian Trust Relationship in Prioritizing Cleanup|last=Tano|first=Mervyn L.|date=March 1998|website=|publisher=International Institute for Indigenous Resource Management|access-date=16 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Environmental Justice Movement ==
The environmental justice movement began after the discovery of illegal dumping throughout 14 North Carolina counties. 31,000 gallons of [[Polychlorinated biphenyl]] (PCB) was dumped by the Ward Transformers Company throughout these counties. The state government in North Carolina devised a landfill diversion plan for this waste after discovering the dumping, but the landfill was sited in Warren County, which had the greatest concentration of African American residents of all North Carolina's 100 counties, and was also the most poor, ranking 97th in GDP of the counties in North Carolina.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://sites.duke.edu/docst110s_01_s2011_sb211/what-is-environmental-justice/history/|title=History: Warren County, NC {{!}} Environmental Injustice|website=sites.duke.edu|access-date=2016-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; The environmental justice movement was made popular by the emphasis on wildlife protection and wilderness preservation during the 20th century, but this presented cost barriers to poorer individuals whose concerns were not with wildlife and wilderness preservation. By virtue of the fact that this movement was not championed by poor people in its formative stages, it has caused these individuals to view the movement as "elitist." This elitism is understood through three different forms, according to a study by Denton E. Morrison and Riley E. Dunlap:
# ''Compositional'' – Environmentalists tend to be from the middle and upper classes, both socially and financially
# ''Ideological'' – The reforms benefit the movement's supporters but impose costs on nonparticipants, i.e.: wildlife preservation benefits middle/upper class individuals because they have a greater utility derived from these things, poor people do not get as much utility
# ''Impact'' – These reforms are "regressive" in their impact to society, meaning that disenfranchised individuals are disproportionally harmed by these changes made by the middle/upper class&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Morrison|first=Denton E.|last2=Dunlap|first2=Riley E.|year=1986|title=Environmentalism and Elitism: A Conceptual and Empirical Analysis|url=|journal=Environmental Management|volume=10|pages=581–589|via=SpringerLink|doi=10.1007/bf01866762}}&lt;/ref&gt;
One of the greatest barriers to entry for poor individuals to join in the environmental justice movement is legal fees. In order to try and prevent the kinds of pollution like that of Warren County, NC, there are a great number of legal fees involved which are often costly. To that end, many of the companies that produce pollution will encourage acceptance of this pollution by communities in order to avoid clean up costs and costs associated with making certain industries more environmentally sustainable.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Brown|first=Thomas C.|last2=Gregory|first2=Robin|date=|year=1999|title=Why the WTA-WTP disparity matters|url=|journal=Ecological Economics|volume=|pages=|via=|doi=10.1016/s0921-8009(98)00050-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; That is, the cost of paying communities to accept pollution is often less than the (initial) cost/s of avoiding pollution all together. Therefore, it can be ascertained that poorer communities are likely to accept compensation for a certain level of pollution, and wealthier communities are willing to accept a smaller amount of pollution and demand a greater level of environmental quality. The difference is that one group is able to pay for environmental quality, and the other group is not.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7909">A '''McKenzie friend''' assists a [[litigant in person]] in a court of law in England and Wales, Northern Ireland, the Republic of Ireland and Australia. This person does not need to be legally qualified. The crucial point is that litigants in person (known as ''party litigants'' in Scotland) are entitled to have assistance, lay or professional, unless there are exceptional circumstances.

Their role was set out most clearly in the eponymous 1970 case ''McKenzie v McKenzie''.&lt;ref&gt;[1971] P 33; [1970] 3 [[Incorporated Council of Law Reporting|WLR]] 472; [1970] 3 All ER 1034, CA&lt;/ref&gt; Although in many cases a McKenzie friend may be an actual friend, it is often somebody with knowledge of the area, and the trend is heavily in favour of admitting McKenzie friends.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.familylawweek.co.uk/site.aspx?i=ed1568 McKenzie Friends], ''[[Family Law Week]]'', Retrieved 15 June 2015&lt;/ref&gt;  He or she may be liable for any misleading advice given to the litigant in person{{citation needed|date=March 2016}} but is not covered by [[professional indemnity]] insurance.

The role is distinct from that of a [[next friend]] or of an ''[[amicus curiae]]''.  A similar, modified principle exists in Singapore.

==Origin==
''McKenzie v. McKenzie'' was a [[divorce]] case in England.&lt;ref name="Scotsman 4May2009"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.scotsman.com/news/little-help-from-my-friends-1-1036759|title=Little help from my friends|last=Forsyth |first=John|date=4 May 2009 |work=[[The Scotsman]]|accessdate=23 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Levine McKenzie, who was petitioning for divorce, had been [[Legal Aid|legally aided]] but the legal aid had been withdrawn before the case went to court. Unable to fund legal representation, McKenzie had broken off contact with his solicitors, Geoffrey Gordon &amp; Co.. However, one day before the hearing, Geoffrey Gordon &amp; Co. sent the case to an Australian barrister in London, Ian Hanger, whose qualifications in law in Australia did not allow him to practise as a barrister in London. Hanger hoped to sit with his client to prompt him, take notes and suggest questions in cross-examination, thereby providing what quiet assistance he could from the [[bar table]] to a man representing himself. The trial judge ordered Hanger not to take any active part in the case (except to advise McKenzie during [[Adjournment#Law|adjournments]]) and to sit in the public gallery of the [[court]].  Hanger assumed his limited role was futile and did not return for the second day of the trial.&lt;ref name="Scotsman 4May2009"/&gt;

The case went against McKenzie, who then appealed to the [[England and Wales Court of Appeal|Court of Appeal]] on the basis that he had been denied representation. On 12 June 1970, the Court of Appeal ruled that the judge's intervention had deprived McKenzie of the assistance to which he was entitled and ordered a retrial.&lt;ref name="McKenzie v McKenzie"&gt;"Litigant In Person Has Right To Assistance" (Law report), ''[[The Times]]'', 17 June 1970, p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ian Hanger [[Order of Australia|AM]] [[Queen's Counsel|QC]], the original McKenzie friend, is now a [[Queen's Counsel]] (QC) at the [[Queensland]] Bar.&lt;ref name="Scotsman 4May2009"/&gt;&lt;ref name="nadrac.gov.au_CommitteeMembers_Hanger"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nadrac.gov.au/www/nadrac/nadrac.nsf/Page/About_NADRACCouncil_Members|title=Council Members|publisher=[[National Alternative Dispute Resolution Advisory Committee]]|accessdate=26 April 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100403083531/http://www.nadrac.gov.au/www/nadrac/nadrac.nsf/Page/About_NADRACCouncil_Members|archivedate=3 April 2010|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In specific jurisdictions==

===Singapore===
In September 2006, the [[Judicial system of Singapore|Subordinate Courts of Singapore]] started a pilot project called the Lay Assistant Scheme in which persons, usually with some legal knowledge, attend hearings with litigants who are not represented by lawyers to advise them on non-legal issues and help them with administrative tasks. The scheme, a modification of the U.K.'s McKenzie friend system, is intended to assist litigants who are not eligible for legal aid as they have an annual salary exceeding S$10,000 but cannot afford a lawyer.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} For the litigant to qualify, the other party must be legally represented.

Lay assistants are not allowed to act as lawyers and may not address the court; any breach of court rules may render them liable to a maximum fine of $1,000 or imprisonment of up to six months.

Plans for introducing McKenzie friends in court proceedings were first announced by [[Chief Justice of Singapore|Chief Justice]] [[Chan Sek Keong]] in May 2006. Students from the Pro Bono Group of the [[National University of Singapore#Law|Faculty of Law, National University of Singapore]], have been participating in the scheme.&lt;ref&gt;Ansley Ng, "[http://www.todayonline.com/articles/164112.asp Law Undergrads in Court's Pilot Scheme] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070312054050/http://www.todayonline.com/articles/164112.asp|date=2007-03-12}}", ''[[Today (Singapore newspaper)|Today]]'' [http://www.todayonline.com] (5 January 2007).&lt;/ref&gt;

===England and Wales===
In English courts, where a case is being heard in private, the use of a McKenzie friend has sometimes been contentious. This is a particular problem in [[family court]] hearings, where it has been held that the nature of the case is so confidential that no one other than the litigants and their professional legal representatives should be admitted to the court.

A 2005 Court of Appeal case, ''In the matter of the children of Mr O'Connell, Mr Whelan and Mr Watson'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite BAILII | court = EWCA | division = Civ | year = 2005 | num = 759 | litigants = O'Connel &amp; Ors (Children) Rev 2 | date = 22 June 2005 | parallelcite = [2005] 3 WLR 1191, [2006] Fam 1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; clarified the law in this area. The result of the appeal has legitimised the use of McKenzie friends in the family court and allowed the litigant to disclose confidential court papers to the McKenzie friend.

England and Wales allow fee charging McKenzie friends, who may charge for their services, including the giving of legal advice. A recent report by the Legal Service Consumer Panel found that fee charging McKenzie friends were a net benefit. The report stated, "They should be viewed as providing valuable support that improves access to justice in the large majority of cases."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/law/2014/apr/17/legal-watchdog-culture-shift-fee-charding-mckenzie-friends |title=Legal watchdog urges culture shift over fee-charging McKenzie friends |first=Owen |last=Bowcott |work=[[The Guardian]] |date=17 April 2014 |accessdate=13 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lawgazette.co.uk/practice/culture-change-needed-to-embrace-fee-charging-mckenzie-friends/5040875.fullarticle ‘Culture change’ needed to embrace fee-charging McKenzie friends], [[The Law Society Gazette]], Retrieved 15 June 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

===Scotland===
Scotland has a separate legal system from England and Wales. The first recorded use of McKenzie friends in Scotland was in April 2007 in the case ''TB &amp; AM v. [[Scottish Children's Reporter Administration|The Authority Reporter]]''.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.scotcourts.gov.uk/search-judgments/judgment-search?indexCatalogue=sheriff-court-judgments&amp;searchQuery=tb+%26+am+v+the+authority+reporter&amp;wordsMode=0&lt;/ref&gt; The one major difference between England and Scotland is that in Scotland McKenzie friends are not permitted to receive remuneration.

A consultative '''constitutional referendum''' was held in [[Moldova]] on 23 May 1999.&lt;ref name=NS&gt;[[Dieter Nohlen]] &amp; Philip Stöver (2010) ''Elections in Europe: A data handbook'', p1330 {{ISBN|978-3-8329-5609-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was initiated by President [[Petru Lucinschi]] and asked voters whether they approved of changing the system of government to a [[presidential system]].&lt;ref name=N1&gt;Nohlen &amp; Stöver, p1339&lt;/ref&gt; The proposal was approved by 64.2% of voters. However, the [[Party of Communists of the Republic of Moldova]] and the [[Alliance for Democracy and Reforms]] opposed Lucinschi, and were able to vote several constitutional changes through parliament on 5 July 2000. The changes reduced the powers of the president and strengthened the parliament and government.&lt;ref&gt;Nohlen &amp; Stöver, p1318&lt;/ref&gt;

==Question==
{{blockquote|Would you be in favour of changing the constitution with the scope to install a presidential system in the Republic of Moldova in which the president of the Republic would be responsible for the formation and leadership of the government as well as for the results of the governing of the country?&lt;ref name=N1/&gt;}}

'''New United Motor Manufacturing, Inc.''' ('''NUMMI''') was an [[automobile]] [[manufacturing]] company in [[Fremont, California]], jointly owned by [[General Motors]] and [[Toyota]] that opened in 1984 and closed in 2010. On October 27, 2010, its former plant reopened as a 100% [[Tesla Motors]]-owned production facility, known as the [[Tesla Factory]].&lt;ref name="sjbj"&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.bizjournals.com/sanjose/news/2010/10/27/tesla-officially-replaces-nummi.html | first=Lisa | last=Sibley | title=Tesla officially replaces NUMMI in Fremont | date=October 27, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The plant is located in the East Industrial area of Fremont between [[Interstate 880]] and [[Interstate 680 (California)|Interstate 680]].

==Overview==
[[File:NUMMIplantMissionPeakPanorama 3199.jpg|250px|thumb|The NUMMI plant in [[Fremont, California]]]]
NUMMI was established at the former [[General Motors]] [[Fremont Assembly]] site that closed in 1982;&lt;ref name=mullfre&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=GcVYAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=XukDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5580%2C1836777 |work=Eugene Register-Guard |location=(Oregon) |agency=wire services |title=GM, Toyota mull joint U.S. venture |date=March 9, 1982 |page=5A}}&lt;/ref&gt; it had been a GM plant since 1962. GM and [[Toyota]] reopened the factory as a [[joint venture]] in 1984 to manufacture vehicles to be sold under both brands.&lt;ref name=timeline/&gt;

GM saw the joint venture as an opportunity to learn about [[lean manufacturing]] from the Japanese company, while Toyota gained its first manufacturing base in North America and a chance to implement its [[Scientific management|Taylorism-inspired]] [[Toyota Production System|production system]] in an American labor environment,&lt;ref name=a95&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/245862516_Democratic_Taylorism_The_Toyota_Production_System_at_NUMMI |title=Democratic Taylorism: The Toyota Production System at NUMMI |date=January 1995 |first=Paul S. |last=Adler |work=ResearchGate |accessdate=October 10, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=npr561/&gt;&lt;ref name=a92-04&gt;Adler 1992, page 4&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=a92-10&gt;Adler 1992, page 10&lt;/ref&gt; avoiding possible [[Protectionism|import restrictions]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.toyota-global.com/company/history_of_toyota/75years/text/leaping_forward_as_a_global_corporation/chapter1/section3/item2.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160330153224/http://www.toyota-global.com/company/history_of_toyota/75years/text/leaping_forward_as_a_global_corporation/chapter1/section3/item2.html |title=Global Website - 75 Years of Toyota - Section 3.

==Facility==
{{Unreferenced section|date=April 2010}}
The plant spans the equivalent of about 88 football fields, and is configured into a main building that does the final assembly of vehicles and five other facilities:
*Plastics facility fabricating bumpers, instrument panels, interior panels, and others;
*Stamping facility that fabricates all visible sheet metal parts;
*Welding facility that assembles all metallic parts into one rigid unit; and
*Two paint facilities, one for passenger vehicles and another for truck cabs.

==Employees==
In the initial 20 months of hiring, NUMMI hired 2,200 hourly workers—85% from the old GM-Fremont plant, among them the old union hierarchy. The union also played a role in selecting managers, except for 16 directly assigned by GM and about 30 Toyota managers and production coordinators from Japan, including the CEO, [[Tatsuo Toyoda]], part of the company's founding family.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://hbr.org/1993/01/time-and-motion-regained |title=Time-and-Motion Regained |first=Paul |last=Adler |work=Harvard Business Review |location=US |date=January 1993 |access-date=July 9, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 2006, the plant had 5,500 employees.&lt;ref name=sim2006&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.eastbaytimes.com/2006/03/05/nummi-plant-a-model-for-ailing-car-industry/ |title=NUMMI plant a model for ailing car industry |last=Simmers |first=Tim |date=March 5, 2006 |website= |publisher=[[Contra Costa Times]] |access-date=November 5, 2017 |quote=5,500 employees.

Until the facility's closure in April 2010, 4,700 workers were employed.&lt;ref name="kvtu" /&gt; NUMMI employees were represented by [[United Auto Workers|The International, United Automobile, Aerospace and Agricultural Implement Workers of America]] (UAW) Local 2244.&lt;ref name=sim2006/&gt;

==Models produced==
The first model NUMMI produced was the [[Chevrolet Nova]] (1984–1988).  This was followed by the [[Geo Prizm]] (1989–1997), the [[Chevrolet Prizm]] (1998–2002) and the [[Toyota Hilux#Fifth generation|Hilux]] (1991–1995, predecessor of the Tacoma), as well as the [[Toyota Voltz]], the Japanese [[right-hand drive]] version of the [[Pontiac Vibe]]. Both of the latter are based on the [[Toyota Matrix]].

Production of the [[Pontiac Vibe]] [[hatchback]] was discontinued in August 2009 as GM phased out the Pontiac brand [[Automotive industry crisis of 2008-2009|in the midst of a bailout]].&lt;ref name="GmDiscontinuation"&gt;{{cite web |title=General Motors Statement Regarding Discontinuation of Pontiac Vibe Production at NUMMI Facility |url= http://media.gm.com/servlet/GatewayServlet?target=http://image.emerald.gm.com/gmnews/viewpressreldetail.do?domain=30&amp;docid=55133 |accessdate=June 20, 2009}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; Along with [[Saturn (automobile)|Saturn]] and [[Hummer]], Pontiac joined [[Oldsmobile]] (which had been discontinued after 2004) among the four GM brands that are no longer in production.

==History==

===Background===

The [[Fremont Assembly]] factory which NUMMI took over was built by [[General Motors Corporation|General Motors]] and operated by them from 1962 to 1982,&lt;ref name=timeline/&gt; when the Fremont employees&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.autointell.com/nao_companies/general_motors/gm-manufacturing/gm-nummi/gmnummi.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304030009/http://www.autointell.com/nao_companies/general_motors/gm-manufacturing/gm-nummi/gmnummi.htm |title=GM Nummi Plant |archivedate=March 4, 2016 |publisher= |accessdate=November 9, 2016 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; were "considered the worst workforce in the automobile industry in the United States", according to the [[United Auto Workers]].&lt;ref name="atc2010"/&gt;&lt;ref name="tal2010"/&gt;&lt;ref name=npr561&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/561/transcript |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160619060428/http://www.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/561/transcript |title=NUMMI 2015, Transcript |first=Ira |last=Glass |authorlink=Ira Glass |date=July 17, 2015 |archivedate=June 19, 2016 |deadurl=no |publisher= |accessdate=November 9, 2016 |quote=nobody in the GM plant would ever ask to help.

There's nobody to pull you out at General Motors, so you're going to let something go. Hundreds of misassembled cars. Never stop the line. .  One reason car execs were in denial was Detroit's insular culture. Yes, unions and management were always at each other's throats, and yes, GM and its suppliers had a destructive relationship that seemed to almost discourage quality. But everyone had settled into comfortable roles in this dysfunctional system and learned to live with it.  -it took about a decade and a half after NUMMI for change to even begin to take hold at GM. By the year 2000, GM finally started to see a generational transformation. |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Employees drank alcohol on the job, were frequently absent (enough so that the production line couldn't be started), and even committed petty acts of sabotage such as putting "Coke bottles inside the door panels, so they'd rattle and annoy the customer."&lt;ref name="atc2010"/&gt;&lt;ref name="tal2010"/&gt; GM was [[Departmentalization|departmentalized]] as per [[Henry Ford]]'s [[Division of labour]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Roos |first1=Daniel |last2=Womack |first2=James P. |last3=Jones |first3=Daniel T |title=The Machine That Changed the World : The Story of Lean Production |publisher=Harper Perennial |date=November 1991 |isbn=978-0060974176}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://web.mit.edu/esd.83/www/notebook/machine.pdf |title=ESD.83 Book Review of The Machine that Changed the World |first=Randy |last=Urbance |publisher=Massachusetts Institute of Technology}}&lt;/ref&gt; but without the necessary communication; management did not consider workers' view of production, and quantity was preferred over quality.&lt;ref name=npr561/&gt;

===Makeover===
The idea of reopening the plant emerged from the need that GM had to build high-quality and profitable small cars and the need Toyota had to start building cars in the United States, a requirement due to the possibility of import restrictions by the U.S. Congress.&lt;ref name="atc2010"&gt;{{cite web|title=The End Of The Line For GM-Toyota Joint Venture |url=http://ww.npr.org/templates/transcript/transcript.php?storyId=125229157 |publisher=[[National Public Radio]] |work=[[All Things Considered]] |first=Robert |last=Siegel |authorlink=Robert Siegel |date=March 26, 2010 |accessdate=April 7, 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160423033037/http://ww.npr.org/templates/transcript/transcript.php?storyId=125229157 |archivedate=April 23, 2016 |deadurl=no |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="tal2010"&gt;{{cite web |title=Episode 403 - NUMMI |url= http://www.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/403/nummi | publisher= [[This American Life]]| date=March 26, 2010 |accessdate=April 7, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The goal was to produce high quality at low cost, but supported by including workers in the process.&lt;ref name=a92-15&gt;Adler 1992, page 15&lt;/ref&gt; The choice of the Fremont plant and its workers was unusual because of the previous problems. In spite of the history and reputation, when NUMMI reopened the factory for production in 1984, 85% of the troublesome GM workforce was rehired,&lt;ref name=a92-12&gt;Adler 1992, page 11-12&lt;/ref&gt; with some sent to Japan to learn the [[Toyota Production System]].&lt;ref name="atc2010"/&gt;&lt;ref name="tal2010"/&gt;&lt;ref name=npr561/&gt; Workers who made the transition identified the emphasis on quality and teamwork by Toyota management as what motivated a change in work ethic.&lt;ref name="atc2010"/&gt;&lt;ref name="tal2010"/&gt; Among the cultural changes were the same uniform, parking and cafeterias for all levels of employment in order to promote the team concept,&lt;ref name=a92-14/&gt;&lt;ref name=a92-33/&gt; and a no-[[layoff]] policy.&lt;ref name=a92-16&gt;Adler 1992, page 16. Quote: "no lay-offs .. are absolutely crucial to our success. Team members know that when they contribute ideas for more effective operations they are not jeopardizing anyone's job. And that's fundamental, since they know more than any manager or industrial engineer about how to improve our efficiency and competitiveness."&lt;/ref&gt; [[Autonomation|Built-in process quality]] and employee suggestion programs for [[continual improvement process|continual improvement]]&lt;ref name=a92-33&gt;Adler 1992, page 33&lt;/ref&gt; were other changes.&lt;ref name=a92-18&gt;Adler 1992, page 18&lt;/ref&gt; [[Consensus decision-making]] reached management level, in contrast with the old [[departmentalization]].&lt;ref name=a92-20&gt;Adler 1992, page 20&lt;/ref&gt;

By December 1984, the first car, a yellow [[Chevrolet Nova#Fifth generation (1985–1988)|Chevrolet Nova]] rolled off the assembly line. And almost right away, the NUMMI factory was producing cars at the same speed and with as few defects per 100 vehicles as those produced in Japan,&lt;ref name=a92-23&gt;Adler 1992, page 23&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="atc2010"/&gt;&lt;ref name="tal2010"/&gt; with higher worker satisfaction.&lt;ref name=a92-24&gt;Adler 1992, page 24&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1988 NUMMI operated at 58.6% capacity, and had not reached [[Break-even (economics)|break-even]] by 1991.&lt;ref name=a92-14&gt;Adler 1992, page 14&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the early success at Fremont, by 1998 (15 years later) GM had still not been able to implement [[lean manufacturing]] in the rest of the United States,&lt;ref name=npr561/&gt;&lt;ref name=hbr2009-09&gt;{{cite web|url= https://hbr.org/2009/09/nummi-what-toyota-learned  |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20160811152723/https://hbr.org/2009/09/nummi-what-toyota-learned |title=Nummi: What Toyota Learned and GM Didn’t |first=Ben |last=Gomes-Casseres |date=September 1, 2009 |publisher=[[Harvard Business Review]] |accessdate= June 5, 2017 |archivedate= August 11, 2016 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; though GM managers trained at NUMMI were successful in introducing the approach to its unionized factories in Brazil.&lt;ref name="brazil98"&gt;{{cite news |title=G.M.'s Plant in Brazil Raises Fears Closer to Home |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1998/06/17/business/gm-s-plant-in-brazil-raises-fears-closer-to-home.html?pagewanted=all | publisher=The New York Times | date=June 17, 1998 |accessdate=April 7, 2010 | first=Keith | last=Bradsher}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 29, 2009, General Motors announced that they would discontinue the joint venture with Toyota.&lt;ref name="LaTimesGmEnds"&gt;{{cite news

 |archivedate=July 2, 2009

}}  &lt;/ref&gt;
The announcement was made following GM CEO Fritz Henderson announcing in April that General Motors would discontinue the Pontiac Vibe production at NUMMI. The two automakers were in discussions but could not find a suitable product to be produced at the factory. “After extensive analysis, GM and Toyota could not reach an agreement on a future product plan that made sense for all parties,” GM North America President Troy Clarke said in a statement.
"Toyota’s hope was to continue the venture and we haven’t yet decided any plans at the factory,” said Hideaki Homma, Toyota's Tokyo-based spokesman. “While we respect this decision by GM, the economic and business environment surrounding Toyota is also extremely severe, and so this decision by GM makes the situation even more difficult for Toyota.” Before GM decided to sever its stake in the NUMMI joint venture, Toyota was considering offering a version of its [[Toyota Prius|Prius]] hybrid to GM that would be built at the factory and sold as a GM model but Toyota has indicated that it was seriously considering exiting the venture also.&lt;ref name="reuters20090710"&gt;{{cite news

In November 2009, Toyota's head of U.S. sales took calls from autoworkers, saying that though it has been a difficult decision to shut down the plant, "the economics of having a plant in California so far away from the supplier lines" in the Midwest "just doesn't make business sense" for Toyota to continue running the NUMMI plant.&lt;ref name="KGO20091117"&gt;{{cite web

The '''Nationality Act'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://law.moj.gov.tw/Eng/LawClass/LawAll.aspx?PCode=D0030001|title=Nationality Act}}&lt;/ref&gt; defines and regulates [[nationality]] of the Republic of China, commonly known as Taiwan. It was first promulgated by the [[Nationalist Government]] on 5 February 1929 and revised by the [[Taipei]]-based [[Legislative Yuan]] in 2000, 2001, and 2006.

The Act, like the [[Constitution of the Republic of China]], makes no provision regarding citizenship. Citizenship rights are currently restricted to persons with [[Hukou system|household registration]] in the [[Taiwan Area]]. The Act sets to define persons in terms of nationality (國籍), terming them as "nationals" (國民) rather than "citizens" (公民), a term that does not appear in the act.

== History ==
===Japanese rule===
According to the 1895 [[Treaty of Shimonoseki]], Taiwan was ceded to Japan, but people living in Taiwan were given "the opportunity to choose their nationality" by either leaving or staying within two years of the treaty being signed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Hsueh|editor1-first=Hua-yuan|script-title=zh:臺灣地位關係文書|date=2007|publisher=日創社文化|location=Taipei|isbn=9789866900044|language=Chinese}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were subjected to [[Japanese nationality law|Japanese laws]].

On the other side, the nationality law of ROC was first promulgated by the [[Nationalist Government]] on 5 February 1929, when Taiwan was still under Japanese rule. However, in 1946, the ROC government announced that the people living in Taiwan had "regained" their status as ROC nationals, which gave rise to diplomatic protests from the UK and the US.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Chen |first=Yi-nan |date=20 January 2011 |page=8 |url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/editorials/archives/2011/01/20/2003493942/1
|title=ROC forced citizenship on unwary Taiwanese |newspaper=Taipei Times |accessdate=2011-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Up to the present day, this Nationality Law has been revised by the [[Taipei]]-based [[Legislative Yuan]] in 2000, 2001, and 2006. The inclusion of native Taiwanese people within its scope of application has also been controversial. Some opponents of the ROC's sovereignty over Taiwan argue that the law has "forced" citizenship onto [[Taiwanese aborigines]].

==Nationality==
The nationality law generally follows ''[[jus sanguinis]]''. The law spells out four criteria, any one of which may be met to qualify for nationality:
#A person whose father or mother is, at the time of his (her) birth, a national of the Republic of China.
#A person born after the death of his (her) father or mother who was, at the time of his (her) death, a national of the Republic of China.
#A person born in the territory of the Republic of China and whose parents are both unknown or are stateless.
#A naturalized person.
In the original version of the law nationality could only be passed from father to child. However, the law was revised in 2000 to allow citizenship to be passed on from either parent, taking effect on those born after 9 February 1980 (those under age 20 at the time of the promulgation).

== Citizenship ==
In practice, exercise of most citizenship benefits, such as suffrage, and labour rights, requires possession of the [[Republic of China National Identification Card]], which is only issued to persons with [[household registration]] in the [[Free Area of the Republic of China|Taiwan Area]] aged 14 and older. Note that children of ROC nationals who were born abroad are eligible for ROC passports and therefore considered to be nationals, but often they do not hold a [[household registration]] so are referred to as "unregistered nationals" in statute. These ROC nationals have no automatic right to stay in Taiwan, nor do they have working rights, voting rights, etc. In a similar fashion, some British passport holders do not have the right of abode in the UK (see [[British nationality law]]). Unregistered nationals can obtain a Republic of China National Identification Card only by settling in Taiwan for one year without leaving, two consecutive years staying in Taiwan for a minimum of 270 days a year or five consecutive years staying 183 days or more in each year.

==Dual nationality and naturalization==
Article 9 of the ROC Nationality Act requires prospective naturalized citizens to first renounce their previous nationality, possibly causing those persons to become stateless if they then fail to obtain ROC nationality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|url=http://jidanni.org/foreigner/index.html
|title=Not allowed to be Taiwanese
|publisher=jidanni.org
|accessdate=2007-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees]] has noted that this has caused thousands of Vietnamese women to become stateless.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unhcr.org/publ/PUBL/46dbd6bd2.html "The Excluded: The strange hidden world of the stateless"]{{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080509071418/http://www.unhcr.org/publ/PUBL/46dbd6bd2.html |date=2008-05-09 }}, UNHCR Refugees Magazine Issue 147.&lt;br&gt;[http://www.unhcr.org/45d324428.html "Divorce leaves some Vietnamese women broken-hearted and stateless"], 14 February 2007, unhcr.com&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2016, the [[Legislative Yuan]] waived Article 9 for the first time, for people who had made "special contributions" to Taiwan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Chang|first1=Jung-hsiang|last2=Low|first2=Y. F.|title=American priest gets ROC ID after 54 years|url=http://focustaiwan.tw/news/asoc/201701060015.aspx|accessdate=6 January 2017|agency=Central News Agency|date=6 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Promulgation of an amendment to Article 9 occurred in March 2017. The amendment states that foreigners who have lived in the Republic of China for five years may apply for citizenship without losing their previous citizenship, given that applicants also have expertise in the areas of technology, economics, arts and culture, education, sports or a "special" category.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Chen|first1=Yu-fu|last2=Chin|first2=Jonathan|title=Some immigrants no longer need to give up citizenship|url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/front/archives/2017/03/24/2003667366|accessdate=24 March 2017|work=Taipei Times|date=24 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Article 9 does not apply to overseas Chinese holding foreign nationality who seek to exercise ROC nationality. Such persons do not need to naturalize because they are already legally ROC nationals.

The Act does not restrict ROC nationals from becoming [[dual national]]s of other countries. Dual nationals are however restricted by Article 20 from holding most [[public office]]s in Taiwan. Indeed, many immigrants to Taiwan give up their original nationality, obtain ROC nationality, then apply again for their original nationality&amp;mdash;which some countries will restore, some after a waiting period. (Notably, the United States government has no such procedure.)  This entire process is fully legal under ROC law, though statistics are not available regarding how many people do this. The Act also permits former nationals of the ROC to apply for restoration of their nationality.

However, by Article 9-1, "[t]he people of the Taiwan Area may not have household registrations in the Mainland Area or hold [[People's Republic of China passport|passports issued by the Mainland Area]]." Republic of China nationals are not recognised to be [[dual national]]s of the People's Republic of China (PRC), which the Republic of China Government does not recognise. If they obtain the passport of the PRC or household registration within mainland China, they will be deprived of their ROC Passport.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://law.moj.gov.tw/LawClass/LawAll.aspx?PCode=Q0010001|title=臺灣地區與大陸地區人民關係條例}}&lt;/ref&gt;

|}

==Status of mainland Chinese and overseas Chinese==
{{main|National without household registration}}
The [[Republic of China]]'s official borders encompass all territories governed by the [[People's Republic of China]] and persons of these territories are considered under ROC law to be nationals of the Republic of China. Thus, if the residents of mainland China want to travel to the Taiwan Area, they must do so using the [[Entry Permit of Mainland Residents to the Taiwan Area]] and residents of Hong Kong and Macau must enter using the [[Entry Permit of HK and Macau Residents to the Taiwan Area]]. [[PRC passport]]s, [[HKSAR passport]]s, [[Macau SAR passport]]s, and [[BN(O) passport]]s are not stamped by Taiwan immigration officers. [[Mongolia]] is also within the ROC's official borders, but since 2002, the government has extended recognition to the Mongolian government and permitted citizens of Mongolia to use their passports to enter Taiwan in lieu of an entry permit.

If the residents of mainland China seek to settle permanently in Taiwan and gain citizenship rights, they do not naturalize like citizens of foreign countries. Instead, they merely can establish household registration, which in practice takes longer and is more complicated than naturalization.

[[Republic of China passport]]s are also issued to [[overseas Chinese]], irrespective of whether they have lived or even set foot in Taiwan. The rationale behind this extension of the principle of ''[[jus sanguinis]]'' to almost ''all'' Chinese regardless of their countries of residence, as well as the recognition of dual citizenships, is to acknowledge the support given by overseas Chinese historically to the [[Kuomintang]] regime, particularly during the [[Xinhai Revolution|Republican Revolution of 1911]]. The type of passport issued to these individuals is called "Overseas Chinese Passport" of the Republic of China (僑民護照) and it is different than the type of passport issued to nationals that possess a national identification card with the former having far more restrictions than the latter. For instance, overseas Chinese passport holders are required to apply for a visa to enter the [[Schengen area]], whereas no visa is required for the regular passport holders. See the [[Republic of China passport|passport]] article for more information about this practice.

But for the residents of mainland China, Hong Kong, and Macau, only after gaining permanent resident status abroad, or otherwise establishing a period of residency defined by the regulations, they become eligible for a [[Republic of China passport]] but do not gain [[#Citizenship|benefits of citizenship]].

== Treatment by international organizations and immigration authorities ==

According to the standards and regulations of most international organizations, "Republic of China" is not a recognized nationality. In the international standard [[ISO 3166-1]], the proper nationality designation for persons domiciled in Taiwan is not ROC, but rather TWN. This three-letter code TWN is also the official designation adopted by the [[International Civil Aviation Organization]] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

The '''''New Criminal Law Review''''' ({{ISSN|1933-4192}}) is a quarterly [[Peer review|peer-reviewed]] [[law journal]] published by [[University of California Press]]. It was established in 1997 as the ''Buffalo Criminal Law Review'', but changed names in 2007 after the [[University of California Press]] took responsibility for publishing the journal. The ''New Criminal Law Review'' focuses on examinations of crime, [[philosophy of criminal law]], and [[punishment (criminal)|punishment]] in domestic, transnational, and international contexts.

The ''New Criminal Law Review'' is ranked as the number one criminal law review, and is ranked as the tenth journal in the world.&lt;ref&gt;see Washington &amp; Lee Law School, Law Journals: Submissions and Ranking, law.wlu.edu)&lt;/ref&gt;{{Verification needed|date=February 2013}}

The '''Partial Test Ban Treaty''' ('''PTBT''') is the abbreviated name of the 1963 '''Treaty Banning Nuclear Weapon Tests in the Atmosphere, in Outer Space and Under Water''', which prohibited all [[Nuclear weapons testing|test detonations]] of [[nuclear weapon]]s except for those conducted [[Underground nuclear weapons testing|underground]]. It is also abbreviated as the '''Limited Test Ban Treaty''' ('''LTBT''') and '''Nuclear Test Ban Treaty''' ('''NTBT'''), though the latter may also refer to the [[Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty]] (CTBT), which succeeded the PTBT for ratifying parties.

Negotiations initially focused on a comprehensive ban, but this was abandoned due to technical questions surrounding the detection of underground tests and Soviet concerns over the intrusiveness of proposed verification methods. The impetus for the test ban was provided by rising public anxiety over the magnitude of nuclear tests, particularly tests of new [[thermonuclear weapon]]s (hydrogen bombs), and the resulting [[nuclear fallout]]. A test ban was also seen as a means of slowing [[nuclear proliferation]] and the [[nuclear arms race]]. Though the PTBT did not halt proliferation or the arms race, its enactment did coincide with a substantial decline in the concentration of radioactive particles in the atmosphere.

The PTBT was signed by the governments of the [[Soviet Union]], [[United Kingdom]], and [[United States]] in [[Moscow]] on 5 August 1963 before being opened for signature by other countries. The treaty formally went into effect on 10 October 1963. Since then, 123 other states have become party to the treaty. Ten states have signed but not ratified the treaty.

==Background==
[[File:Bravo fallout2.png|thumb|300px|Castle Bravo fallout plume]]
Much of the stimulus for the treaty was increasing public unease about radioactive fallout as a result of above-ground or underwater nuclear testing, particularly given the increasing power of nuclear devices, as well as concern about the general environmental damage caused by testing.&lt;ref name=atomicheritage/&gt; In 1952–53, the US and Soviet Union detonated their first [[thermonuclear weapons]] (hydrogen bombs), far more powerful than the [[Nuclear weapon#Fission weapons|atomic bomb]]s tested and deployed since [[Trinity (nuclear test)|1945]].&lt;ref name="statedept"&gt;{{cite web |title=Limited Test Ban Treaty |url=https://www.state.gov/t/isn/4797.htm |publisher=US Department of State |accessdate=31 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=atomicvshydrogen&gt;{{cite news |title=A-bombs vs. H-bombs: What's the difference? |work=[[The Globe and Mail]] |date=28 March 2016 |agency=[[Associated Press]] |url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/world/a-bombs-vs-h-bombs-whats-thedifference/article28030528/ |last=Kageyama |first=Yuri |accessdate=31 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1954, the US [[Castle Bravo]] test at [[Bikini Atoll]] (part of [[Operation Castle]]) had a yield of 15 [[TNT equivalent|megatons of TNT]], more than doubling the expected yield. The Castle Bravo test resulted in the worst radiological event in US history as radioactive particles spread over more than {{convert|11,000|km2|mi2|sp=us}}, affected inhabited areas (including [[Rongelap Atoll]] and [[Utirik Atoll]]), and sickened Japanese fishermen aboard the ''[[Daigo Fukuryū Maru|Lucky Dragon]]'' upon whom "ashes of death" had rained.&lt;ref name=atomicheritage&gt;{{cite web |title=Limited or Partial Test Ban Treaty (LTBT/PTBT) |publisher=[[Atomic Heritage Foundation]] |url=http://www.atomicheritage.org/history/limited-or-partial-test-ban-treaty-ltbtptbt |accessdate=1 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=bravo&gt;{{cite web |title=1 March 1954 – Castle Bravo |publisher=[[Preparatory Commission for the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty Organization]] |url=https://www.ctbto.org/specials/testing-times/1-march-1954-castle-bravo/ |accessdate=31 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Schlesinger|2002|p=450}}{{sfn|Rhodes|2005|p=542}} In the same year, a Soviet test sent radioactive particles over Japan.{{sfn|Burns|Siracusa|2013|p=247}} Around the same time, victims of the [[Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|atomic bombing of Hiroshima]] visited the US for medical care, which attracted significant public attention.&lt;ref name=nsarchive&gt;{{cite web |title=The Making of the Limited Test Ban Treaty, 1958–1963 |last1=Burr |first1=William |last2=Montford |first2=Hector L. |publisher=[[National Security Archive]] |date=3 August 2003 |url=http://nsarchive.gwu.edu/NSAEBB/NSAEBB94/ |accessdate=7 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1961, the Soviet Union tested the [[Tsar Bomba]], which had a yield of 50 megatons and remains the most powerful man-made explosion in history, though due to a highly efficient detonation fallout was relatively limited.&lt;ref name=tsar&gt;{{cite web |title=30 October 1961 – The Tsar Bomba |publisher=Preparatory Commission for the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty Organization |url=https://www.ctbto.org/specials/testing-times/30-october-1961-the-tsar-bomba/ |accessdate=31 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=tsar2&gt;{{cite web |title=Tsar Bomba: The World's Most Powerful Nuclear Weapon |last=Morton |first=Ella |publisher=[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]] |url=http://www.slate.com/blogs/atlas_obscura/2014/10/30/tsar_bomba_the_most_powerful_nuclear_weapon_ever.html |date=30 October 2014 |accessdate=31 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=bulletin&gt;{{cite web |title=The Khariton Version |publisher=[[Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists]] |last1=Khariton |first1=Yuli |last2=Smirnov |first2=Yuri |url=http://www.thebulletin.org/issues/1993/may93/may93Khariton.html |date=May 1993 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030221213340/http://www.thebulletin.org/issues/1993/may93/may93Khariton.html |archive-date=21 February 2003 |accessdate=3 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1951 and 1958, the US conducted 166 atmospheric tests, the Soviet Union conducted 82, and Britain conducted 21; only 22 underground tests were conducted in this period (all by the US).&lt;ref name=nrdc&gt;{{cite web |title=Archive of Nuclear Data |url=http://www.nrdc.org/nuclear/nudb/datab15.asp |publisher=[[Natural Resources Defense Council]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071010072829/http://www.nrdc.org/nuclear/nudb/datab15.asp |archive-date=10 October 2007 |accessdate=6 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Negotiations==
===Early efforts===

In 1945, Britain and Canada made an early call for an international discussion on controlling atomic power. At the time, the US had yet to formulate a cohesive policy or strategy on nuclear weapons. Taking advantage of this was [[Vannevar Bush]], who had initiated and administered the [[Manhattan Project]], but nevertheless had a long-term policy goal of banning on nuclear weapons production. As a first step in this direction, Bush proposed an international agency dedicated to nuclear control.{{sfn|Polsby|1984|p=56}} Bush unsuccessfully argued in 1952 that the US pursue a test ban agreement with the Soviet Union before testing its first thermonuclear weapon,{{sfn|Schlesinger|2002|p=450}} but his interest in international controls was echoed in the 1946 [[Acheson–Lilienthal Report]], which had been commissioned by President [[Harry S. Truman]] to help construct US nuclear weapons policy. [[J. Robert Oppenheimer]], who had led [[Los Alamos National Laboratory]] during the Manhattan Project, exerted significant influence over the report, particularly in its recommendation of an international body that would control production of and research on the world's supply of [[uranium]] and [[thorium]]. A version of the Acheson-Lilienthal plan was presented to the [[United Nations Atomic Energy Commission]] as the [[Baruch Plan]] in June 1946. The Baruch Plan proposed that an International Atomic Development Authority would control all research on and material and equipment involved in the production of atomic energy.&lt;ref name="rydell"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.armscontrol.org/act/2006_06/LookingbackBaruch|title=LOOKING BACK: Going for Baruch: The Nuclear Plan That Refused to Go Away|date=1 June 2006|publisher=Arms Control Association|accessdate=11 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Strode|1990|p=7}} Though [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]], then the [[Chief of Staff of the United States Army]], was not a significant figure in the Truman administration on nuclear questions, he did support Truman's nuclear control policy, including the Baruch Plan's provision for an international control agency, provided that the control system was accompanied by "a system of free and complete inspection."{{sfn|Greene|2006|pp=12–14}}

[[File:Ivy Mike (Eniwetok-Atoll - 31. Oktober 1952).jpg|thumb|250px|The [[Ivy Mike]] test of 1952, an early thermonuclear detonation]] The Soviet Union dismissed the Baruch Plan as a US attempt to secure its nuclear dominance, and called for the US to halt weapons production and release technical information on its program. The Acheson–Lilienthal paper and Baruch Plan would serve as the basis for US policy into the 1950s. Between 1947 and 1954, the US and Soviet Union discussed their demands within the United Nations Commission for Conventional Disarmament. A series of events in 1954, including the Castle Bravo test and spread of fallout from a Soviet test over Japan, redirected the international discussion on nuclear policy. Additionally, by 1954, both US and Soviet Union had assembled large nuclear stockpiles, reducing hopes of complete disarmament.{{sfn|Polsby|1984|pp=57–58}} In the early years of the [[Cold War]], the US approach to nuclear control reflected a strain between an interest in controlling nuclear weapons and a belief that dominance in the nuclear arena, particularly given the size of Soviet conventional forces, was critical to US security. Interest in nuclear control and efforts to stall proliferation of weapons to other states grew as the Soviet Union's nuclear capabilities increased.{{sfn|Jacobson|Stein|1966|pp=5–7}}

====After Castle Bravo: 1954–58====
In 1954, just weeks after the Castle Bravo test, Indian prime minister [[Jawaharlal Nehru]] made the first call for a "standstill agreement" on nuclear testing, who saw a testing moratorium as a stepping stone to more comprehensive arms control agreements.&lt;ref name=bravo/&gt;{{sfn|Burns|Siracusa|2013|p=247}} In the same year, the [[Labour Party (UK)|British Labour Party]], then led by [[Clement Attlee]], called on the UN to ban testing of thermonuclear weapons.{{sfn|Polsby|1984|p=58}} 1955 marks the beginning of test-ban negotiations, as Soviet leader [[Nikita Khrushchev]] first proposed talks on the subject in February 1955.{{sfn|Rhodes|2008|p=72}}{{sfn|Reeves|1993|p=121}} On 10 May 1955, the Soviet Union proposed a test ban before the UN Disarmament Commission's "Committee of Five" (Britain, [[Canada]], [[France]], the Soviet Union, and the US). This proposal, which closely reflected a prior Anglo-French proposal, was initially part of a comprehensive disarmament proposal meant to reduce conventional arms levels and eliminate nuclear weapons. Despite the closeness of the Soviet proposal to earlier Western proposals, the US reversed its position on the provisions and rejected the Soviet offer "in the absence of more general control agreements," including limits on the production of [[Nuclear fission|fissionable]] material and protections against a [[Pre-emptive nuclear strike|surprise nuclear strike]].&lt;ref name=statedept/&gt; The May 1955 proposal is now seen as evidence of Khrushchev's "new approach" to foreign policy, as Khrushchev sought to mend relations with the West. The proposal would serve as the basis of the Soviet negotiating position through 1957.{{sfn|Evangelista|1999|pp=91–93}}

Eisenhower had supported nuclear testing after [[World War II]]. In 1947, he rejected arguments by [[Stafford L. Warren]], the Manhattan Project's chief physician, concerning the detrimental health effects of atmospheric testing, agreeing instead with [[James Bryant Conant]], a chemist and participant in the Manhattan Project, who was skeptical of Warren's then-theoretical claims.{{clarify|what exactly was the difference of opinion and how did Bravo change all that? Project 4.1 had yet to be finalized som medical evidence was lacking|date=October 2016}} Warren's arguments{{which|date=October 2016}} were lent credence in the scientific community and public by the Castle Bravo test of 1954.{{sfn|Greene|2006|pp=10–11}} Eisenhower, as president, first explicitly expressed interest in a comprehensive test ban that year, arguing before the [[United States National Security Council|National Security Council]], "We could put [the Russians] on the spot if we accepted a moratorium&amp;nbsp;... Everybody seems to think that we're skunks, saber-rattlers and warmongers. We ought not miss any chance to make clear our peaceful objectives."&lt;ref name=nsarchive/&gt; Then-Secretary of State [[John Foster Dulles]] had responded skeptically to the limited arms-control suggestion of Nehru, whose proposal for a test ban was discarded by the National Security Council for being "not practical."{{sfn|Burns|Siracusa|2013|p=247}}&lt;ref name=macdonald/&gt; [[Harold Stassen]], Eisenhower's special assistant for disarmament, argued that the US should prioritize a test ban as a first step towards comprehensive arms control, conditional on the Soviet Union accepting on-site inspections, over full disarmament. Stassen's suggestion was dismissed by others in the administration over fears that the Soviet Union would be able to conduct secret tests.{{sfn|Burns|Siracusa|2013|p=305}} On the advice of Dulles, [[United States Atomic Energy Commission|Atomic Energy Commission]] (AEC) chairman [[Lewis Strauss]], and Secretary of Defense [[Charles Erwin Wilson]], Eisenhower rejected the idea of considering a test ban outside general disarmament efforts.{{sfn|Polsby|1984|p=61}} During the [[United States presidential election, 1952|1952]] and [[United States presidential election, 1956|1956]] presidential elections, Eisenhower fended off challenger [[Adlai Stevenson II|Adlai Stevenson]], who ran in large part on support for a test ban.{{sfn|Greene|2006|p=7}}

[[File:Eisenhower and Strauss.jpg|left|thumb|[[Dwight D. Eisenhower|Eisenhower]] and [[Lewis Strauss|Strauss]] discuss [[Operation Castle]], 1954]]
The British governments of 1954–58 (under [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservatives]] [[Winston Churchill]], [[Anthony Eden]], and [[Harold Macmillan]]) also quietly resisted a test ban, despite the British public favoring a deal, until the [[United States Congress|US Congress]] approved expanded nuclear collaboration in 1958 and until after Britain had tested its [[Operation Grapple|first hydrogen bombs]].{{sfn|Greene|2006|p=7}} In their view, testing was necessary if the UK nuclear program were to continue to develop. This opposition was tempered by concern that resistance to a test ban might lead the US and Soviet Union to pursue an agreement without Britain having any say in the matter.{{sfn|Risse-Kappen|1995|p=112}}

Members of the Soviet [[military–industrial complex]] also opposed a test ban, though some scientists, including [[Igor Kurchatov]], were supportive of antinuclear efforts.{{sfn|Burns|Siracusa|2013|p=248}} France, which was in the midst of developing its own nuclear weapon, also firmly opposed a test ban in the late 1950s.{{sfn|Ambrose|1991|p=457}}

The proliferation of thermonuclear weapons coincided with a rise in public concern about [[nuclear fallout]] debris contaminating food sources, particularly the threat of high{{Citation needed|date=October 2016}} levels of [[strontium-90]] in milk (see the [[Baby Tooth Survey]]). This survey was a "campaign [that] effectively employed a variety of media advocacy strategies" to alarm the public and "galvanized" support against atmospheric nuclear testing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.668.4804&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf|title=Download Limit Exceeded|website=citeseerx.ist.psu.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lewis Strauss]] and [[Edward Teller]], dubbed the "father of the hydrogen bomb,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.stanford.edu/news/2003/september24/tellerobit-924.html |title=Edward Teller, 'Father of the Hydrogen Bomb,' is dead at 95 |author=Joel N.

Teller also suggested that testing was necessary to develop nuclear weapons that produced less fallout.

Moreover, widespread antinuclear protests were organized and led by theologian and [[Nobel Peace Prize]] laureate [[Albert Schweitzer]], whose appeals were endorsed by [[Pope Pius XII]], and [[Linus Pauling]], the latter of whom organized an anti-test petition signed by more than 9,000 scientists across 43 countries (including the infirm and elderly [[Albert Einstein]]).{{sfn|Seaborg|1981|p=8}}{{sfn|Strode|1990|p=31}} Although notably, many health scientists that were asked to sign were critical of Pauling's "thoroughly unscientific" fallout assumptions, despite most wishing for a test-ban for other reasons, they could not bring themselves to sign a document that promoted such exaggerations of the dangers, as it would result in eventual public distrust of scientists in the long term.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.lib.utexas.edu/etd/d/2008/rubinsonp66913/rubinsonp66913.pdf The U.S. National Security State and Scientists’Challenge to Nuclear Weapons during the Cold War.

The AEC would eventually concede,{{Citation needed|date=October 2016}} as well, that even low levels of radiation were harmful.{{sfn|Burns|Siracusa|2013|p=305}}{{better source|date=October 2016}} It was a combination of rising public support for a test ban and the shock of the 1957 Soviet ''[[Sputnik]]'' launch that encouraged Eisenhower to take steps towards a test ban in 1958.&lt;ref name=macdonald/&gt;{{sfn|Burns|Siracusa|2013|pp=247–249, 305}}

There was also increased environmental concern in the Soviet Union. In the mid-1950s, Soviet scientists began taking regular radiation readings near [[Leningrad]], [[Moscow]], and [[Odessa]] and collected data on the prevalence of strontium-90, which indicated that strontium-90 levels in western Russia approximately matched those in the eastern US. Rising Soviet concern was punctuated in September 1957 by the [[Kyshtym disaster]], which forced the evacuation of 10,000 people after an explosion at a nuclear plant. Around the same time, 219 Soviet scientists signed Pauling's antinuclear petition. Soviet political elites did not share the concerns of others in the Soviet Union. However; Kurchatov unsuccessfully called on Khrushchev to halt testing in 1958.{{sfn|Strode|1990|pp=31–32}}

On 14 June 1957, following Eisenhower's suggestion that existing detection measures were inadequate to ensure compliance,{{sfn|Ambrose|1991|pp=457–458}}  the Soviet Union put forth a plan for a two-to-three-year testing moratorium. The moratorium would be overseen by an international commission reliant on national monitoring stations, but, importantly, would involve no on-the-ground inspections. Eisenhower initially saw the deal as favorable, but eventually came to see otherwise. In particular, Strauss and Teller, as well as [[Ernest Lawrence]] and [[Mark Muir Mills]], protested the offer. At a meeting with Eisenhower in the White House, the group argued that testing was necessary for the US to eventually develop bombs that produced no fallout ("clean bombs"). The group repeated the oft-cited fact, which was supported by [[Freeman Dyson]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.powermag.com/too-dumb-to-meter-part-7/?pagenum=3|title=Too Dumb to Meter, Part 7|date=1 January 2013|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; that the Soviet Union could conduct secret nuclear tests.{{sfn|Seaborg|1981|pp=8–9}} In 1958, at the request of Igor Kurchatov, Soviet nuclear physicist and weapons designer [[Andrei Sakharov]] published a pair of widely circulated academic papers challenging the claim of Teller and others that a clean, fallout-free nuclear bomb could be developed, due to the formation of [[carbon-14]] when nuclear devices are detonated in the air. A one-megaton clean bomb, Sakharov estimated, would cause 6,600 deaths over 8,000 years, figures derived largely from estimates on the quantity of [[carbon-14]] generated from atmospheric nitrogen and the contemporary risk models at the time, along with the assumption that the world population is "thirty billion persons" in a few thousand years.&lt;ref name=sakharovpaper&gt;{{cite journal |title=Radioactive carbon from nuclear explosion and nonthreshold biological effects |last=Sakharov |first=Andrei |author-link=Andrei Sakharov |journal=The Soviet Journal of Atomic Energy |url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2FBF01515403 |volume=4 |issue=6 |pages=757–762 |date=June 1958|doi=10.1007/BF01515403 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Burns|Siracusa|2013|p=152}}&lt;ref name=aip&gt;{{cite web |title=Nuclear Testing and Conscience, 1957–1963 |publisher=[[American Institute of Physics]] |url=https://www.aip.org/history/exhibits/sakharov/dangers.htm |accessdate=11 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1961, Sakharov was part of the design team for a 50 megaton "clean bomb", which has become known as the [[Tsar Bomba]], detonated over the island of [[Novaya Zemlya]].&lt;ref name=aip/&gt;

[[File:International Diplomacy.jpg|thumb|[[Harold Macmillan|Macmillan]] (second from left) with [[Dwight D. Eisenhower|Eisenhower]] in March 1957]]
In the spring of 1957, the US National Security Council had explored including a one-year test moratorium and a "cut-off" of fissionable-material production in a "partial" disarmament plan. The British government, then led by Macmillan, had yet to fully endorse a test ban. Accordingly, it pushed the US to demand that the production cut-off be closely timed with the testing moratorium, betting that the Soviet Union would reject this. London also encouraged the US to delay its disarmament plan, in part by moving the start of the moratorium back to November 1958. At the same time, Macmillan linked British support for a test ban to a revision of the [[Atomic Energy Act of 1946]] (McMahon Act), which prohibited sharing of nuclear information with foreign governments. Eisenhower, eager to mend ties with Britain following the [[Suez Crisis]] of 1956, was receptive to Macmillan's conditions, but the AEC and the congressional [[United States Congress Joint Committee on Atomic Energy|Joint Committee on Atomic Energy]] were firmly opposed. It was not until after ''Sputnik'' in late 1957 that Eisenhower quickly moved to expand nuclear collaboration with the UK via presidential directives and the establishment of bilateral committees on nuclear matters. In early 1958, Eisenhower publicly stated that amendments to the McMahon Act were a necessary condition of a test ban, framing the policy shift in the context of US commitment to its [[NATO]] allies.{{sfn|Risse-Kappen|1995|pp=112–114}}

In August 1957, the US assented to a two-year testing moratorium proposed by the Soviet Union, but required that it be linked to restrictions on the production of fissionable material with military uses, a condition that the Soviet Union rejected.{{sfn|Seaborg|1981|p=9}} While Eisenhower insisted on linking a test ban to a broader disarmament effort (e.g., the production cut-off), Moscow insisted on independent consideration of a test ban.{{sfn|Polsby|1984|p=61}}

On 19 September 1957, the US conducted the first contained underground test at the [[Nevada Test Site]], codenamed ''[[Operation Plumbbob#Rainier|Rainier]]''. The ''Rainier'' shot complicated the push for a comprehensive test ban, as underground tests could not be as easily identified as atmospheric tests.{{sfn|Seaborg|1981|p=9}}

Despite Eisenhower's interest in a deal, his administration was hamstrung by discord among US scientists, technicians, and politicians. At one point, Eisenhower complained that "statecraft was becoming a prisoner of scientists."&lt;ref name=macdonald/&gt;{{sfn|Greene|2006|pp=2, 6}} Until 1957, Strauss's AEC (including its Los Alamos and [[Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory|Livermore]] laboratories) was the dominant voice in the administration on nuclear affairs, with Teller's concerns over detection mechanisms also influencing Eisenhower.{{sfn|Seaborg|1981|p=9}}{{sfn|Burns|Siracusa|2013|p=249}} Unlike some others within the US scientific community, Strauss fervently advocated against a test ban, arguing that the US must maintain a clear nuclear advantage via regular testing and that the negative environmental impacts of such tests were overstated. Furthermore, Strauss repeatedly emphasized the risk of the Soviet Union violating a ban, a fear Eisenhower shared.{{sfn|Greene|2006|p=5}}

On 7 November 1957, after ''Sputnik'' and under pressure to bring on a dedicated science advisor, Eisenhower created the [[President's Science Advisory Committee]] (PSAC), which had the effect of eroding the AEC's monopoly over scientific advice.{{sfn|Polsby|1984|p=63}} In stark contrast to the AEC, PSAC promoted a test ban and argued against Strauss's claims concerning its strategic implications and technical feasibility.{{sfn|Seaborg|1981|p=9}}{{sfn|Burns|Siracusa|2013|pp=249, 305}}{{sfn|Greene|2006|pp=6–8}} In late 1957, the Soviet Union made a second offer of a three-year moratorium without inspections, but lacking any consensus within his administration, Eisenhower rejected it. In early 1958, the discord within American circles, particularly among scientists, was made clear in hearings before the Senate Subcommittee on Nuclear Disarmament, chaired by Senator [[Hubert Humphrey]]. The hearings featured conflicting testimony from the likes of Teller and Linus Pauling, as well as from Harold Stassen, who argued that a test ban could safely be separated from broader disarmament, and AEC members, who argued that a cutoff in nuclear production should precede a test ban.{{sfn|Seaborg|1981|pp=10–11}}{{sfn|Polsby|1984|p=64}}

====Khrushchev and a moratorium: 1958–61====
In the summer of 1957, Khrushchev was at acute risk of losing power, as the [[Anti-Party Group]] composed of former [[Joseph Stalin|Stalin]] allies [[Lazar Kaganovich]], [[Georgy Malenkov]], and [[Vyacheslav Molotov]] launched an attempt to replace Khrushchev as [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|General Secretary of the Communist Party]] (effectively the leader of the Soviet Union) with [[Nikolai Bulganin]], then the [[Premier of the Soviet Union]]. The attempted ouster, which was foiled in June, was followed by a series of actions by Khrushchev to consolidate power. In October 1957, still feeling vulnerable from Anti-Party Group's ploy, Khrushchev forced out defense minister [[Georgy Zhukov]], cited as "the nation's most powerful military man." On 27 March 1958, Khrushchev forced Bulganin to resign and succeeded him as Premier. Between 1957 and 1960, Khrushchev had his firmest grip on power, with little real opposition.{{sfn|Taubman|2003|pp=361–362, 364–365}}

Khrushchev was personally troubled by the power of nuclear weapons and would later recount that he believed the weapons could never be used. In the mid-1950s, Khrushchev took a keen interest in defense policy and sought to inaugurate an era of [[détente]] with the West. Initial efforts to reach accords, such as on disarmament at the 1955 [[Geneva Summit (1955)|Geneva Summit]], proved fruitless, and Khrushchev saw test-ban negotiations as an opportunity to present the Soviet Union as "both powerful and responsible."{{sfn|Taubman|2003|pp=347–348, 350, 352}}{{sfn|Strode|1990|p=6}} At the [[20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|20th Communist Party Congress]] in 1956, Khrushchev declared that nuclear war should no longer be seen as "fatalistically inevitable." Simultaneously, however, Khrushchev expanded and advanced the Soviet nuclear arsenal at a cost to conventional Soviet forces (e.g., in early 1960, Khrushchev announced demobilization of 1.2 million troops).{{sfn|Strode|1990|pp=5–6}}

On 31 March 1958, the [[Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union]] approved a decision to halt nuclear testing, conditional on other nuclear powers doing the same. Khrushchev then called on Eisenhower and Macmillan to join the moratorium. Despite the action being met with widespread praise and an argument from Dulles that the US should reciprocate,{{sfn|Polsby|1984|p=64}} Eisenhower dismissed the plan as a "gimmick"; the Soviet Union had just completed a testing series and the US was about to begin [[Operation Hardtack I]], a series of atmospheric, surface-level, and underwater nuclear tests. Eisenhower instead insisted that any moratorium be linked to reduced production of nuclear weapons. In April 1958, the US began Operation Hardtack I as planned.{{sfn|Ambrose|1991|pp=457–458}}&lt;ref name="hardtack"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dtra.mil/Portals/61/Documents/NTPR/1-Fact_Sheets/20_HARDTACK_I.pdf|title=Operation HARDTACK I|date=May 2015|publisher=[[Defense Threat Reduction Agency]]|accessdate=6 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Seaborg|1981|p=11}} The Soviet declaration concerned the British government, which feared that the moratorium might lead to a test ban before its own testing program was completed.{{sfn|Risse-Kappen|1995|p=114}} Following the Soviet declaration, Eisenhower called for an international meeting of experts to determine proper control and verification measures—an idea first proposed by British [[Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs|Foreign Secretary]] [[Selwyn Lloyd]].&lt;ref name=statedept/&gt;{{sfn|Risse-Kappen|1995|p=114}}

The advocacy of PSAC, including that of its chairmen [[James Rhyne Killian]] and [[George Kistiakowsky]], was a key factor in Eisenhower's eventual decision to initiate test-ban negotiations in 1958.{{sfn|Burns|Siracusa|2013|pp=249, 305}}{{sfn|Greene|2006|pp=6–8}} In the spring of 1958, chairman Killian and the PSAC staff (namely [[Hans Bethe]] and [[Isidor Isaac Rabi]]) undertook a review of US test-ban policy, determining that a successful system for detecting underground tests could be created. At the recommendation of Dulles (who had recently come to support a test ban),{{sfn|Seaborg|1981|p=9}} the review prompted Eisenhower to propose technical negotiations with the Soviet Union, effectively detaching test-ban negotiations from negotiations over a halt to nuclear weapons production (the one-time US demand). In explaining the policy shift, Eisenhower privately said that continued resistance to a test ban would leave the US in a state of "moral isolation."{{sfn|Ambrose|1991|pp=458–459}}

On 8 April 1958, still resisting Khrushchev's call for a moratorium, Eisenhower invited the Soviet Union to join these technical negotiations in the form of a conference on the technical aspects of a test-ban, specifically the technical details of ensuring compliance with a ban. The proposal was, to a degree, a concession to the Soviet Union, as a test ban would be explored independent of the previously demanded cutoff in fissionable-material production. Khrushchev initially declined the invitation, but eventually agreed "in spite of the serious doubts" he had after Eisenhower suggested a technical agreement on verification would be a precursor to a test ban.{{sfn|Seaborg|1981|pp=11–12}}

On 1 July 1958, responding to Eisenhower's call, the nuclear powers convened the Conference of Experts in [[Geneva]], aimed at studying means of detecting nuclear tests.&lt;ref name=nsarchive/&gt;{{sfn|Seaborg|1981|p=12}} The conference included scientists from the US, Britain, the Soviet Union, Canada, Czechoslovakia, France, Poland, and Romania.&lt;ref name=faschron/&gt; The US delegation was led by James Fisk, a member of PSAC, the Soviets by Evgenii Fedorov,{{sfn|Evangelista|1999|p=78}} and the British delegation by [[William Penney, Baron Penney|William Penney]], who had led the British delegation to the Manhattan Project. Whereas the US approached the conference solely from a technical perspective, Penney was specifically instructed by Macmillan to attempt to achieve a political agreement.{{sfn|Risse-Kappen|1995|p=115}} This difference in approach was reflected in the broader composition of the US and UK teams. US experts were primarily drawn from academia and industry. Fisk was a vice president at [[Bell Telephone Company|Bell Telephone]] Laboratories and was joined by [[Robert Bacher]] and Ernest Lawrence, both physicists who had worked on the Manhattan Project.{{sfn|Seaborg|1981|p=12}} Conversely, British delegates largely held government positions. The Soviet delegation was composed primarily of academics, though virtually all of them had some link to the Soviet government. The Soviets shared the British goal of achieving an agreement at the conference.{{sfn|Evangelista|1999|pp=60–61}}

At particular issue was the ability of sensors to differentiate an underground test from an earthquake. There were four techniques examined: measurement of [[acoustic wave]]s, seismic signals, [[radio waves]], and inspection of radioactive debris. The Soviet delegation expressed confidence in each method, while Western experts argued that a more comprehensive compliance system would be necessary.{{sfn|Seaborg|1981|p=12}}

The Conference of Experts was characterized as "highly professional" and productive.{{sfn|Risse-Kappen|1995|p=115}}{{sfn|Evangelista|1999|p=61}} By the end of August 1958, the experts devised an extensive control program, known as the "Geneva System," involving 160–170 land-based monitoring posts, plus 10 additional sea-based monitors and occasional flights over land following a suspicious event (with the inspection plane being provided and controlled by the state under inspection). The experts determined that such a scheme would be able to detect 90% of underground detonations, accurate to 5 kilotons, and atmospheric tests with a minimum yield of 1 kiloton.&lt;ref name=nsarchive/&gt;{{sfn|Burns|Siracusa|2013|p=249}}{{sfn|Seaborg|1981|p=12}} The US had initially advocated for 650 posts, versus a Soviet proposal of 100–110. The final recommendation was a compromise forged by the British delegation.{{sfn|Evangelista|1999|p=62}} In a widely publicized and well-received communiqué dated 21 August 1958, the conference declared that it "reached the conclusion that it is technically feasible to set up&amp;nbsp;... a workable and effective control system for the detection of violations of a possible agreement on the worldwide cessation of nuclear weapons tests."{{sfn|Seaborg|1981|p=12}}

[[File:Hardtack De Baca 001.jpg|thumb|US test detonation (part of [[Operation Hardtack II]]) conducted shortly before the start of the moratorium in 1958]]
The technical findings, released on 30 August 1958 in a report drafted by the Soviet delegation,{{sfn|Seaborg|1981|p=12}}{{sfn|Evangelista|1999|p=61}} were endorsed by the US and UK, which proposed that they serve as the basis for test-ban and international-control negotiations. However, the experts' report failed to address precisely who would do the monitoring and when on-site inspections—a US demand and Soviet concern—would be permitted. The experts also deemed detection of outer-space tests (tests more than {{Convert|50|km|mi|sp=us}} above the earth's surface) to be impractical. Additionally, the size of the Geneva System may have rendered it too expensive to be put into effect. The 30 August report, which contained details on these limitations, received significantly less public attention than the 21 August communiqué.&lt;ref name=nsarchive/&gt;{{sfn|Burns|Siracusa|2013|p=249}}{{sfn|Seaborg|1981|p=12}}&lt;ref name="faschron" /&gt;

Nevertheless, pleased by the findings, the Eisenhower administration proposed negotiations on a permanent test ban{{sfn|Seaborg|1981|p=14}} and announced it would self-impose a year-long testing moratorium if Britain and the Soviet Union did the same. This decision amounted to a victory for John Foster Dulles, Allen Dulles (then the [[Director of Central Intelligence]]), and PSAC, who had argued within the Eisenhower administration for separating a test ban from larger disarmament efforts, and a defeat for the [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]] and AEC, which had argued to the contrary.{{sfn|Polsby|1984|p=65}}

In May 1958, Britain had informed that US that it would be willing to join a testing moratorium on 31 October 1958, by which point it would have finished its hydrogen-bomb testing, conditional on the US providing Britain with nuclear information following amendment of the McMahon Act. The US Congress approved amendments permitting greater collaboration in late June.{{sfn|Risse-Kappen|1995|pp=114–115, 119}} Following Soviet assent on 30 August 1958 to the one-year moratorium, the three countries conducted a series of tests in September and October. At least 54 tests were conducted by the US and 14 by the Soviet Union in this period. On 31 October 1958 the three countries initiated test-ban negotiations (the Conference on the Discontinuance of Nuclear Tests) and agreed to a temporary moratorium (the Soviet Union joined the moratorium shortly after this date).&lt;ref name=nsarchive/&gt;&lt;ref name=macdonald&gt;{{cite journal |title=Eisenhower's Scientists: Policy Entrepreneurs and the Test-Ban Debate 1954–1958 |last=MacDonald |first=Julia M. |journal=[[Foreign Policy Analysis (journal)|Foreign Policy Analysis]] |volume=11 |pages=1–21 |date=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=faschron&gt;{{cite web |title=Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty Chronology |publisher=Federation of American Scientists |url=http://fas.org/nuke/control/ctbt/chron1.htm |accessdate=7 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nti"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nti.org/learn/treaties-and-regimes/treaty-banning-nuclear-test-atmosphere-outer-space-and-under-water-partial-test-ban-treaty-ptbt/|title=Treaty Banning Nuclear Tests in the Atmosphere, in Outer Space and Under Water (Partial Test Ban Treaty) (PTBT)|date=26 October 2011|publisher=[[Nuclear Threat Initiative]]|accessdate=31 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The moratorium would last for close to three years.{{sfn|Seaborg|1981|p=15}}

The Conference on the Discontinuance of Nuclear Tests convened in Geneva at Moscow's request (the Western participants had proposed [[New York City]]). The US delegation was led by [[James Jeremiah Wadsworth]], an envoy to the UN, the British by [[David Ormsby-Gore, 5th Baron Harlech|David Ormsby-Gore]], the [[Minister of State for Foreign Affairs (United Kingdom)|Minister of State for Foreign Affairs]], and the Soviets by Semyon K. Tsarapkin, a disarmament expert with experience dating back to the 1946 Baruch Plan. The Geneva Conference began with a Soviet draft treaty grounded in the Geneva System. The three nuclear weapons states (the "original parties") would abide by a test ban, verified by the Geneva System, and work to prevent testing by potential nuclear states (such as France). This was rejected by Anglo-American negotiators due to fears that the verification provisions were too vague and the Geneva System too weak.{{sfn|Seaborg|1981|pp=15–16}}

Shortly after the Geneva Conference began in the fall of 1958, Eisenhower faced renewed domestic opposition to a comprehensive test ban as Senator [[Albert Gore Sr.]] argued in a widely circulated letter that a partial ban would be preferable due to Soviet opposition to strong verification measures.{{sfn|Seaborg|1981|p=15}}

The Gore letter did spur some progress in negotiations, as the Soviet Union allowed in late November 1958 for explicit control measures to be included in the text of the drafted treaty. By March 1959, the negotiators had agreed upon seven treaty articles, but they primarily concerned uncontroversial issues and a number of disputes over verification persisted. First, the Soviet verification proposal was deemed by the West to be too reliant on self-inspection, with control posts primarily staffed by citizens of the country housing the posts and a minimal role for officials from the international supervisory body. The West insisted that half of a control post staff be drawn from another nuclear state and half from neutral parties. Second, the Soviet Union required that the international supervisory body, the Control Commission, require unanimity before acting; the West rejected the idea of giving Moscow a veto over the Commission's proceedings. Finally, the Soviet Union preferred temporary inspection teams drawn from citizens of the country under inspection, while the West insisted on permanent teams composed of inspectors from the Control Commission.{{sfn|Seaborg|1981|pp=15–16}}

Additionally, despite the initial positive response to the Geneva experts' report, data gathered from Hardtack operations of 1958 (namely the underground ''Rainier'' shot) would further complication verification provisions as US scientists, including Hans Bethe (who backed a ban), became convinced that the Geneva findings were too optimistic regarding detection of underground tests, though Macmillan warned that using the data to block progress on a test ban might be perceived in the public as a political ploy.{{sfn|Risse-Kappen|1995|pp=118–119}} In early 1959, Wadsworth told Tsarapkin of new US skepticism towards the Geneva System. While the Geneva experts believed the system could detect underground tests down to five kilotons, the US now believed that it could only detect tests down to 20 kilotons (in comparison, the [[Little Boy]] bomb dropped on [[Hiroshima]] had an official yield of 13 kilotons).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://permalink.lanl.gov/object/tr?what=info:lanl-repo/lareport/LA-08819|title=The Yields of the Hiroshima and Nagasaki Nuclear Explosions|last=Malik|first=John|date=September 1985|website=|publisher=Los Alamos National Laboratory|access-date=12 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, the Geneva detection regime and the number of control posts would have to be significantly expanded, including new posts within the Soviet Union. The Soviets dismissed the US argument as a ruse, suggesting that the Hardtack data had been falsified.{{sfn|Seaborg|1981|p=17}}

In early 1959, a roadblock to an agreement was removed as Macmillan and Eisenhower, over opposition from the Department of Defense, agreed to consider a test ban separately from broader disarmament endeavors.&lt;ref name=statedept/&gt;{{sfn|Risse-Kappen|1995|p=118}}

On 13 April 1959, facing Soviet opposition to on-site detection systems for underground tests, Eisenhower proposed moving from a single, comprehensive test ban to a graduated agreement where atmospheric tests—those up to 50&amp;nbsp;km (31&amp;nbsp;mi) high, a limit Eisenhower would revise upward in May 1959—would be banned first, with negotiations on underground and outer-space tests continuing. This proposal was turned down on 23 April 1959 by Khrushchev, calling it a "dishonest deal."{{sfn|Seaborg|1981|p=17}} On 26 August 1959, the US announced it would extend its year-long testing moratorium to the end of 1959, and would not conduct tests after that point without prior warning. The Soviet Union reaffirmed that it would not conduct tests if the US and UK continued to observe a moratorium.&lt;ref name=faschron/&gt;

To break the deadlock over verification, Macmillan proposed a compromise in February 1959 whereby each of the original parties would be subject to a set number of on-site inspections each year. In May 1959, Khrushchev and Eisenhower agreed to explore Macmillan's quota proposal, though Eisenhower made further test-ban negotiations conditional on the Soviet Union dropping its Control Commission veto demand and participating in technical discussions on identification of [[high-altitude nuclear explosion]]s. Khrushchev agreed to the latter and was noncommittal on the former.{{sfn|Seaborg|1981|pp=17–18}} A working group in Geneva would eventually devise a costly system of 5–6 satellites orbiting at least {{convert|18,000|mi|km|sp=us}} above the earth, though it could not say with certainty that such a system would be able to determine the origin of a high-altitude test. US negotiators also questioned whether high-altitude tests could evade detection via [[Radiation protection#Shielding|radiation shielding]]. Concerning Macmillan's compromise, the Soviet Union privately suggested it would accept a quota of three inspections per year. The US argued that the quota should be set according to scientific necessity (i.e., be set according to the frequency of seismic events).{{sfn|Seaborg|1981|pp=19–20}}

In June 1959, a report of a panel headed by [[Lloyd Berkner]], a physicist, was introduced into discussions by Wadsworth. The report specifically concerned whether the Geneva System could be improved without increasing the number of control posts. Berkner's proposed measures were seen as highly costly and the technical findings themselves were accompanied by a caveat about the panel's high degree of uncertainty given limited data. Around the same time, analysis conducted by the Livermore National Laboratory and [[RAND Corporation]] at Teller's instruction found that the seismic effect of an underground test could be artificially dampened (referred to as "decoupling") to the point that a 300-kiloton detonation would appear in seismic readings as a one-kiloton detonation. These findings were largely affirmed by pro-ban scientists, including Bethe. The third blow to the verification negotiations was provided by a panel chaired by Robert Bacher, which found that even on-site inspections would have serious difficulty determining whether an underground test had been conducted.{{sfn|Seaborg|1981|pp=17–19}}

In September 1959, Khrushchev visited the US While the test ban was not a focus on conversations, a positive meeting with Eisenhower at [[Camp David]] eventually led Tsarapkin to propose a technical working group in November 1959 that would consider the issues of on-site inspections and seismic decoupling in the "spirit of Camp David." Within the working group, Soviet delegates allowed for the timing of on-site inspections to be grounded in seismic data, but insisted on conditions that were seen as excessively strict. The Soviets also recognized the theory behind decoupling, but dismissed its practical applications. The working group closed in December with no progress and significant hostility. Eisenhower issued a statement blaming "the recent unwillingness of the politically guided Soviet experts to give serious scientific consideration to the effectiveness of seismic techniques for the detection of underground nuclear explosions." Eisenhower simultaneously declared that the US would not be held to its testing moratorium when it expired on 31 December 1959, though pledged to not test if Geneva talks progressed. The Soviet Union followed by reiterating its decision to not test as long as Western states did not test.{{sfn|Seaborg|1981|pp=20–21}}

In early 1960, Eisenhower indicated his support for a comprehensive test ban conditional on proper monitoring of underground tests.{{sfn|Ambrose|1991|pp=504–505}} On 11 February 1960, Wadsworth announced a new US proposal by which only tests deemed verifiable by the Geneva System would be banned, including all atmospheric, underwater, and outer-space tests within detection range. Underground tests measuring more than 4.75 on the [[Richter magnitude scale|Richter scale]] would also be barred, subject to revision as research on detection continued. Adopting Macmillan's quota compromise, the US proposed each nuclear state be subject to roughly 20 on-site inspections per year (the precise figure based on the frequency of seismic events).{{sfn|Seaborg|1981|p=22}}

Tsarapkin responded positively to the US proposal, though was wary of the prospect of allowing underground tests registering below magnitude 4.75. In its own proposal offered 19 March 1960 the Soviet Union accepted most US provisions, with certain amendments. First, the Soviet Union asked that underground tests under magnitude 4.75 be banned for a period of four-to-five years, subject to extension. Second, it sought to prohibit all outer-space tests, whether within detection range or not. Finally, the Soviet Union insisted that the inspection quota be determined on a political basis, not a scientific one. The Soviet offer faced a mixed reception. In the US, Senator Hubert Humphrey and  the [[Federation of American Scientists]] (which was typically seen as supportive of a test ban) saw it as a clear step towards an agreement. Conversely, AEC chairman [[John A. McCone]] and Senator [[Clinton Presba Anderson]], chair of the Joint Committee on Atomic Energy, argued that the Soviet system would be unable to prevent secret tests. That year, the AEC published a report arguing that the continuing testing moratorium risked "free world supremacy in nuclear weapons," and that renewed testing was critical for further weapons development. The joint committee also held hearings in April which cast doubt on the technical feasibility and cost of the proposed verification measures.{{sfn|Seaborg|1981|pp=22–23, 33}} Additionally, Teller continued to warn of the dangerous consequences of a test ban and the Department of Defense (including [[Neil H. McElroy]] and [[Donald A. Quarles]], until recently its top two officials) pushed to continue testing and expand missile stockpiles.{{sfn|Ambrose|1991|pp=504–505}}

Shortly after the Soviet proposal, Macmillan met with Eisenhower at Camp David to devise a response. The Anglo-American counterproposal agreed to ban small underground tests (those under magnitude 4.75) on a temporary basis (a duration of roughly 1 year, versus the Soviet proposal of 4–5 years), but this could only happen after verifiable tests had been banned and a seismic research group (the Seismic Research Program Advisory Group) convened. The Soviet Union responded positively to the counterproposal and the research group convened on 11 May 1960. The Soviet Union also offered to keep an underground ban out of the treaty under negotiation. In May 1960, there were high hopes that an agreement would be reached at an upcoming summit of Eisenhower, Khrushchev, Macmillan, and [[Charles de Gaulle]] of France in Paris.{{sfn|Seaborg|1981|pp=22–24}}{{sfn|Polsby|1984|p=69}}

A test ban seemed particularly close in 1960, with Britain and France in accord with the US (though France conducted its [[Gerboise Bleue|first nuclear test]] in February) and the Soviet Union having largely accepted the Macmillan-Eisenhower proposal. But US-Soviet relations soured after an American [[Lockheed U-2|U-2 spy plane]] was [[1960 U-2 incident|shot down]] in Soviet airspace in May 1960.&lt;ref name=faschron/&gt; The Paris summit was abruptly cancelled and the Soviet Union withdrew from the seismic research group, which subsequently dissolved. Meetings of the Geneva Conference continued until December, but little progress was made as Western-Soviet relations continued to grow more antagonistic through the summer, punctuated by the [[Congo Crisis]] in July and angry exchanges at the UN in September.{{sfn|Seaborg|1981|p=24}} Macmillan would later claim to President [[John F. Kennedy]] that the failure to achieve a test ban in 1960 "was all the fault of the American 'big hole' obsession and the consequent insistence on a wantonly large number of on-site inspections."{{sfn|Jacobson|Stein|1966|pp=345}}{{sfn|Schlesinger|2002|p=452}}

Eisenhower would leave office with an agreement out of reach, as Eisenhower's technical advisors, upon whom he relied heavily, became mired in the complex technical questions of a test ban, driven in part by a strong interest among American experts to lower the error rate of seismic test detection technology.{{sfn|Burns|Siracusa|2013|pp=249, 305}}{{sfn|Greene|2006|pp=6–8}} Some, including Kistiakowsky, would eventually raise concerns about the ability of inspections and monitors to successfully detect tests.&lt;ref name=fas&gt;{{cite web|title=National Security Policy; Arms Control and Disarmament – Foreign Relations of the United States 1958–1960, Volume III |publisher=[[Federation of American Scientists]] |url=https://fas.org/spp/starwars/offdocs/ike/index.html |accessdate=1 August 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305075241/https://fas.org/spp/starwars/offdocs/ike/index.html |archivedate=5 March 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The primary product of negotiations under Eisenhower was the testing moratorium without any enforcement mechanism.{{sfn|Gaddis|1982|p=193}} Ultimately, the goal of a comprehensive test ban would be abandoned in favor of a partial ban due to questions over seismic detection of underground tests.{{sfn|Burns|Siracusa|2013|pp=249, 305}}

Political scientist [[Robert Gilpin]] later argued that Eisenhower faced three camps in the push for a test ban.{{sfn|Gilpin|1962}} The first was the "control" camp, led by figures like Linus Pauling and astronomer [[Harlow Shapley]], which believed that both testing and possession of nuclear weapons was dangerous. Second, there was the "finite containment" camp, populated by scientists like Hans Bethe, which was concerned by perceived Soviet aggression but still believed that a test ban would be workable with adequate verification measures. Third, the "infinite containment" camp, of which Strauss, Teller, and members of the defense establishment were members, believed that any test ban would grant the Soviet Union the ability to conduct secret tests and move ahead in the arms race.{{sfn|Polsby|1984|pp=61–63}}

The degree of Eisenhower's interest in a test ban is a matter of some historical dispute.{{sfn|Greene|2006|p=1}} [[Stephen E. Ambrose]] writes that by early 1960, a test ban had become "the major goal of his President, indeed of his entire career," and would be "his final and most lasting gift to his country."{{sfn|Ambrose|1991|p=504}} Conversely, [[John Lewis Gaddis]] characterizes negotiations of the 1950s as "an embarrassing series of American reversals," suggesting a lack of real US commitment to arms control efforts.{{sfn|Gaddis|1982|pp=192–193}} The historian Robert Divine also attributed the failure to achieve a deal to Eisenhower's "lack of leadership," evidenced by his inability to overcome paralyzing differences among US diplomats, military leaders, national security experts, and scientists on the subject. [[Paul Nitze]] would similarly suggest that Eisenhower never formulated a cohesive test ban policy, noting his ability to "believe in two mutually contradictory and inconsistent propositions at the same time."{{sfn|Burns|Siracusa|2013|p=250}}

===Renewed efforts===
[[File:Kennedy and Khrushchev at Vienna Meeting - NARA - 193203.jpg|thumb|250px|[[John F. Kennedy|Kennedy]] and [[Nikita Khrushchev|Khrushchev]] in Vienna]]
Upon assuming the presidency in January 1961, John F. Kennedy was committed to pursuing a comprehensive test ban and ordered a review of the American negotiating position in an effort to accelerate languishing talks, believing Eisenhower's approach to have been "insufficient."{{sfn|Burns|Siracusa|2013|p=305}}{{sfn|Schlesinger|2002|p=304}}{{sfn|Seaborg|1981|p=30}} In making his case for a test ban, Kennedy drew a direct link between continued testing and nuclear proliferation, calling it the "'Nth-country' problem." While a candidate, Kennedy had argued, "For once [[China]], or France, or [[Sweden]], or half a dozen other nations successfully test an atomic bomb, the security of both Russians and Americans is dangerously weakened." He had also claimed that renewed testing would be "damaging to the American image" and might threaten the "existence of human life." On the campaign trail, Kennedy's test-ban proposal consisted of a continued US testing moratorium, expanded efforts to reach a comprehensive agreement, limit any future tests to those minimizing fallout, and expand research on fallout.{{sfn|Burns|Siracusa|2013|pp=306–307}}{{sfn|Seaborg|1981|p=32}} Notably, early in his term, Kennedy also presided over a significant increase in defense spending, which was reciprocated by the Soviet Union shortly thereafter, thus placing the test-ban negotiations in the context of an accelerating arms race.{{sfn|Jacobson|Stein|1966|pp=339–341}}

On 21 March 1961, test-ban negotiations resumed in Geneva and [[Arthur Dean (lawyer)|Arthur Dean]], a lead US envoy,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Arthur H. Dean, Envoy to Korea Talks, Dies at 89 |last=Krebs |first=Albin |work=The New York Times |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1987/12/01/obituaries/arthur-h-dean-envoy-to-korea-talks-dies-at-89.html?pagewanted=all |date=1 December 1987 |accessdate=31 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; offered a new proposal in an attempt to bridge the gap between the two sides. The early Kennedy proposal largely grew out of later Eisenhower efforts, with a ban on all tests but low-yield underground ones (below magnitude 4.75), which would be subject to a three-year moratorium.{{sfn|Polsby|1984|p=69}} The US and UK proposed 20 on-site inspections per annum, while the Soviet Union proposed three. The verification procedures included in the Anglo-American plan were unacceptable to Tsarapkin, who responded with separate proposals rejected by the Western powers.&lt;ref name=faschron/&gt; Specifically, the Soviet Union proposed a "troika" mechanism: a monitoring board composed of representatives of the West, the Soviet Union, and [[Non-Aligned Movement|nonaligned states]] that would require unanimity before acting (effectively giving the Soviet Union veto authority).{{sfn|Polsby|1984|p=69}}{{sfn|Schlesinger|2002|pp=305–306, 369}} In May 1961, Kennedy attempted via secret contact between Attorney General [[Robert F. Kennedy]] and a Soviet intelligence officer to settle on 15 inspections per year. This was rejected by Khrushchev.{{sfn|Evangelista|1999|p=78}}

Ahead of the June 1961 [[Vienna summit]] between Kennedy and Khrushchev, Robert F. Kennedy spoke with the Soviet ambassador to the US, who suggested that progress on a test ban was possible in a direct meeting between the leaders.{{sfn|Schlesinger|2002|p=348}} President Kennedy subsequently announced to the press that he had "strong hopes" for progress on a test ban.{{sfn|Schlesinger|2002|p=356}} In Vienna, Khrushchev suggested that three inspections per year would have to be the limit, as anything more frequent would constitute [[espionage]]. Khrushchev privately believed allowing three inspections to be a significant concession to the West, as other Soviet officials preferred an even less intrusive system, and was angered by US resistance. Khrushchev later told his son, "hold out a finger to them—they chop off your whole hand."{{sfn|Evangelista|1999|p=79}}

Additionally, the Soviet Union had once been ready to support an control commission under the aegis of the UN, Khrushchev explained, but it could not longer do so given perceived bias in recent UN action in the Congo.{{sfn|Schlesinger|2002|p=369}} Instead, Khrushchev reiterated the troika proposal.{{sfn|Schlesinger|2002|pp=305–306, 369}} Furthermore, Khrushchev insisted that the test ban be considered in the context of "general and complete disarmament," arguing that a test ban on its own was unimportant; Kennedy said the US could only agree with a guarantee that a disarmament agreement would be reached quickly (the Vienna demands thus amounted to a reversal of both sides' earlier positions).{{sfn|Polsby|1984|p=69}} Kennedy also disagreed that a test ban was itself insignificant; the world could expect many more countries in the coming years to cross the nuclear threshold without a test ban. Ultimately, the two leaders left Vienna without clear progress on the subject.{{sfn|Schlesinger|2002|pp=369–370}} The Soviet Union would drop the general-disarmament demand in November 1961.&lt;ref name=statedept/&gt;

====Lifting the moratorium: 1961–62====
Following the setback in Vienna and [[Berlin Crisis of 1961]], as well as the Soviet decision to resume testing in August (attributed by Moscow to a changed international situation and French nuclear tests), Kennedy faced mounting pressure from the Department of Defense and nuclear laboratories to set aside the dream of a test ban. In June 1961, following stalled talks in Geneva, Kennedy had argued that Soviet negotiating behavior raised "a serious question about how long we can safely continue on a voluntary basis a refusal to undertake tests in this country without any assurance that the Russians are not testing." Whether or not the Soviet Union had actually conducted secret tests was a matter of debate within the Kennedy administration. A team led by physicist [[Wolfgang K. H. Panofsky]] reported that while the Soviet Union could have secretly tested weapons, there was no evidence indicating that it actually had. Panofsky's findings were dismissed by the [[Joint Chiefs of Staff]] as "assertive, ambiguous, semiliterate and generally unimpressive."{{sfn|Burns|Siracusa|2013|p=307}}{{sfn|Schlesinger|2002|pp=455–456}}

Two weeks after the lifting of the Soviet moratorium in August 1961, and after another failed Anglo-American attempt to have the Soviet Union agree to an atmospheric-test ban, the US restarted testing on 15 September 1961. Kennedy specifically limited such testing to underground and laboratory tests, but under mounting pressure as Soviet tests continued — during the time period of the Soviet ''[[Tsar Bomba]]'' 50 Mt+ test detonation on October 30 over [[Novaya Zemlya]] — Kennedy announced and dedicated funds to a renewed atmospheric testing program in November 1961.{{sfn|Burns|Siracusa|2013|p=307}}{{sfn|Jacobson|Stein|1966|pp=343–344}}

A report on the 1961 Soviet tests, published by a group of American scientists led by Hans Bethe, determined "that [Soviet] laboratories had probably been working full speed during the whole moratorium on the assumption that tests would at some time be resume," with preparations likely having begun prior to the resumption of talks in Geneva in March 1961. In January 1962, Bethe, who had once supported a test ban, publicly argued that a ban was "no longer a desirable goal" and the US should test weapons developed by its laboratories. In contrast to Soviet laboratories, US laboratories had been relatively inactive on nuclear weapons issues during the moratorium.{{sfn|Jacobson|Stein|1966|pp=342–343}}

[[File:Hatless Jack.jpg|thumb|[[Harold Macmillan|Macmillan]] and [[John F. Kennedy|Kennedy]] in Bermuda]]
In December 1961, Macmillan met with Kennedy in [[Bermuda]], appealing for a final and permanent halt to tests. Kennedy, conversely, used the meeting to request permission to test on [[Christmas Island]], with US testing grounds in the Pacific having largely been exhausted. Macmillan agreed to seek to give US permission "if the situation did not change." Christmas Island was ultimately opened to US use by February 1962.{{sfn|Jacobson|Stein|1966|pp=344–345, 347}}

On this matter of resumed atmospheric tests, Kennedy lacked the full backing of his administration and allies. In particularly, Macmillan, Adlai Stevenson (then the [[United States Ambassador to the United Nations|UN ambassador]]), the [[United States Department of State|State Department]], the [[United States Information Agency]], and [[Jerome Wiesner]], the PSAC chairman, opposed resuming atmospheric tests. On the side advocating resumption were the AEC, Joint Committee on Atomic Energy, Joint Chiefs of Staff (which had called for renewed atmospheric tests in October 1961), and Department of Defense, though then-Secretary of Defense [[Robert McNamara]] privately acknowledged that such tests were "not really necessary." Teller continued to advocate for atmospheric tests, as well, arguing in early 1962 that nuclear fallout was nothing be concerned about. Teller also argued that testing was necessary to continued advancement of US nuclear capabilities, particularly in terms of the mobility of its weapons and, accordingly, its [[Second strike|second-strike capability]].{{sfn|Jacobson|Stein|1966|pp=345–346}}

Despite Teller's reassurances, Kennedy himself "hated the idea of reopening the race" and was uneasy with continued production of fallout,{{sfn|Schlesinger|2002|p=455}} a negative consequence of resumed testing that its opponents within the administration stressed. Opponents of the tests also argued that renewed atmospheric tests would come at a significant moral cost to the US, given broad public opposition to the plan, and claimed that further tests were largely unnecessary, with the US already having an adequate nuclear arsenal.{{sfn|Jacobson|Stein|1966|pp=346–347}} Arthur Dean believed that public opposition to atmospheric testing was so great that the US would have to halt such tests within four years even without an agreement.{{sfn|Strode|1990|p=33}} [[John Kenneth Galbraith]], then the [[United States Ambassador to India|ambassador to India]], had advised Kennedy in June 1961 that resumed testing "would cause us the gravest difficulties in Asia, Africa and elsewhere." Similarly, Hubert Humphrey described the moratorium as "a ray of hope to millions of worried people." Its termination, Humphrey warned, "might very well turn the political tides in the world in behalf of the Soviets."{{sfn|Schlesinger|2002|p=455}}

Ultimately, Kennedy sided with those arguing for resumed testing. In particular, an argument by William C. Foster, the head of the [[Arms Control and Disarmament Agency]], swayed Kennedy. Foster argued that if the US failed to respond to the Soviet test series, Moscow could order a second test series, which could give the Soviet Union a significant advantage. Furthermore, a second test series, without US reciprocation, could damage the push for a test ban and make [[United States Senate|Senate]] ratification of any agreement less likely.{{sfn|Jacobson|Stein|1966|pp=347–348}} On 2 March 1962, building on the November 1961 announcement, Kennedy promised to resume atmospheric testing by the end of April 1962 if Moscow continued to resist the Anglo-American test-ban proposal.&lt;ref name=faschron/&gt; To an extent, the announcement was a compromise, as Kennedy restricted atmospheric tests to those tests which were "absolutely necessary," not feasible underground, and minimized fallout. The condition that testing would resume only if the Soviet Union continued to oppose the Anglo-American proposal also served as a concession to dissenting voices within his administration and to Macmillan.{{sfn|Jacobson|Stein|1966|pp=347–348}}

Kennedy portrayed resumed testing as a necessary for the image of US resolve. If the US failed to respond to the Soviet test series, Kennedy explained, Moscow would "chalk it up, not to goodwill, but to a failure of will—not to our confidence in Western superiority, but to our fear of world opinion." Keeping the US in a position of strength, Kennedy argued, would be necessary for a test ban to ever come about.{{sfn|Jacobson|Stein|1966|p=349}}

The US suspension of atmospheric tests was lifted on 25 April 1962.&lt;ref name=faschron/&gt;&lt;ref name=cq/&gt;

By March 1962, the trilateral talks in Geneva had shifted to 18-party talks at the UN Disarmament Conference.{{sfn|Strode|1990|pp=19–20}} On 27 August 1962, within that conference, the US and UK offered two draft treaties to the Soviet Union. The primary proposal included a comprehensive ban verified by control posts under national command, but international supervision, and required on-site inspections. This was rejected by the Soviet Union due to the inspection requirement. The alternative proposal included a partial test ban—underground tests would be excluded—to be verified by national detection mechanisms, without supervision by a supranational body.&lt;ref name=faschron/&gt;{{sfn|Polsby|1984|p=71}}

====Cuban Missile Crisis and beyond: 1962–63====
In October 1962, the US and Soviet Union experienced the [[Cuban Missile Crisis]], which brought the two superpowers to the edge of nuclear war and prompted both Kennedy and Khrushchev to seek accelerated [[rapprochement]].&lt;ref name=atomicheritage/&gt;{{sfn|Burns|Siracusa|2013|p=307}}&lt;ref name=cuba&gt;{{cite web |title=1963–1977: Limits on Nuclear Testing |publisher=Preparatory Commission for the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty Organization |url=https://www.ctbto.org/the-treaty/history-1945-1993/1963-77-limits-on-nuclear-testing/ |accessdate=31 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=cuba2&gt;{{cite web |title=Cuban Missile Crisis |publisher=[[John F.

For this reason, many in the Soviet weapons industry argued that a partial ban would give the US the advantage in nuclear capabilities.{{sfn|Evangelista|1999|pp=81–82}} Khrushchev would later recount that he saw test-ban negotiations as a prime venue for ameliorating tensions after the crisis in Cuba.{{sfn|Strode|1990|p=24}}

Shocked by how close the world had come to thermonuclear war, Khrushchev proposed easing of tensions with the US.&lt;ref&gt;Stone, Oliver and Peter Kuznick, "The Untold History of the United States" (Gallery Books, 2012), page 313&lt;/ref&gt; In a letter to President Kennedy dated 30 October 1962, Kurshchev outlined a range of bold initiatives to forestall the possibility of nuclear war, including proposing a non-aggression treaty between the [[North Atlantic Treaty Organization]] (NATO) and the [[Warsaw Pact]] or even the disbanding these military blocs, a treaty to cease all nuclear weapons testing and even the elimination of all nuclear weapons, resolution of the hot-button issue of Germany by both East and West formally accepting the existence of [[West Germany]] and [[East Germany]], and US recognition of the government of mainland China. The letter invited counter-proposals and further exploration of these and other issues through peaceful negotiations. Khrushschev invited [[Norman Cousins]], the editor of a major US periodical and an anti-nuclear weapons activist, to serve as liaison with President Kennedy, and Cousins met with Khrushchev for four hours in December 1962.&lt;ref&gt;Stone, Oliver and Peter Kuznick, "The Untold History of the United States" (Gallery Books, 2012), page 313-14, ''citing'' Message from Chairman Khrushchev to President Kennedy, October 30, 1962, in ''Foreign Relations of the United States, 1961–1963'', vol. 11, (Washington, DC, US Government Printing Office , 1997), pages 309–317&lt;/ref&gt;  Kennedy's response to Khrushchev's proposals was lukewarm but Kennedy expressed to Cousins that he felt constrained in exploring these issues due to pressure from hardliners in the US national security apparatus. However Kennedy pursued negotiations for a partial nuclear test ban.&lt;ref&gt;Stone, Oliver and Peter Kuznick, "The Untold History of the United States" (Gallery Books, 2012), page 313-14&lt;/ref&gt;

On 13 November 1962, Tsarapkin indicated that the Soviet Union would accept a proposal drafted by US and Soviet experts involving automated test detection stations ("black boxes") and a limited number of on-site inspections. The two sides disagreed over the number of black boxes, however, as the US sought 12–20 such stations and the Soviet Union rejected any more than three.{{sfn|Polsby|1984|p=71}} On 28 December 1962, Kennedy lowered the US demand to 8–10 stations. On 19 February 1963, the number was lowered further to seven, as Khrushchev continued to insist on no more than three.&lt;ref name=cq/&gt; Kennedy was willing to reduce the number to six, though this was not clearly communicated to the Soviet Union.{{sfn|Evangelista|1999|p=80}} On 20 April 1963, Khrushchev withdrew support for three inspections entirely.{{sfn|Strode|1990|p=21}}

Progress was further complicated in early 1963, as a group in the US Congress called for the Soviet proposal to be discarded in favor of the Geneva System.{{sfn|Polsby|1984|p=71}} On 27 May 1963, 34 US Senators, led by Humphrey and [[Thomas J. Dodd]], introduced a [[simple resolution|resolution]] calling for Kennedy to propose another partial ban to the Soviet Union involving national monitoring and no on-site inspections. Absent Soviet agreement, the resolution called for Kennedy to continue to "pursue it with vigor, seeking the widest possible international support" while suspending all atmospheric and underwater tests. The effect of the resolution was to bolster the general push for a test ban, though Kennedy initially was concerned that it would damage attempts to secure a comprehensive ban, and had administration figures (including the Joint Chiefs of Staff) reiterate a call for a comprehensive ban.&lt;ref name=cq/&gt;{{sfn|Schlesinger|2002|pp=899–900}}{{sfn|Polsby|1984|p=72}} That same spring of 1963, however, Kennedy had sent antinuclear activist [[Norman Cousins]] to Moscow to meet with Khrushchev, where he explained that the political situation in the US made it very difficult for Kennedy agree to a comprehensive ban with Khrushchev's required terms. Cousins also assured Khrushchev that though Kennedy had rejected Khrushchev's offer of three yearly inspections, he still was set on achieving a test ban.{{sfn|Evangelista|1999|p=85}} In March 1963, Kennedy had also held a press conference in which he re-committed to negotiations with the Soviet Union as a means of preventing rapid nuclear proliferation, which he characterized as "the greatest possible danger and hazard."{{sfn|Rhodes|2008|p=71}}

[[File:President Kennedy American University Commencement Address June 10, 1963.jpg|thumb|[[John F. Kennedy|Kennedy]] at American University]]
One of Kennedy's advisors, [[Walt Whitman Rostow]], advised the President to make a test ban conditional on the Soviet Union withdrawing troops from [[Cuba]] and abiding by a 1962 agreement on [[Laos]], but Kennedy opted instead for test-ban negotiations without preconditions.{{sfn|Gaddis|1982|pp=228–229}} On 10 June 1963, in an effort to reinvigorate and recontextualize a test ban, President Kennedy dedicated his [[American University speech|commencement address at American University]] to "the most important topic on earth: world peace" and proceeded to make his case for the treaty.{{sfn|Schlesinger|2002|p=900}} Kennedy first called on Americans to dispel the idea that peace is unattainable. "Let us focus instead on a more practical, more attainable peace," Kennedy said, "based not on a sudden revolution in human nature but on a gradual evolution in human institutions—on a series of concrete actions and effective agreements which are in the interest of all concerned." Second, Kennedy appealed for a new attitude towards the Soviet Union, calling Americans to not "see only a distorted and desperate view of the other side, not to see conflict as inevitable, accommodations as impossible and communication as nothing more than an exchange of threats."&lt;ref name=au/&gt; Finally, Kennedy argued for a reduction in Cold War tensions, with a test ban serving as a first step towards complete disarmament:

&lt;blockquote&gt;...&amp;nbsp;where a fresh start is badly needed—is in a treaty to outlaw nuclear tests. The conclusion of such a treaty—so near and yet so far—would check the spiraling arms race in one of its most dangerous areas. It would place the nuclear powers in a position to deal more effectively with one of the greatest hazards which man faces in 1963, the further spread of nuclear arms. It would increase our security—it would decrease the prospects of war. Surely this goal is sufficiently important to require our steady pursuit, yielding neither to the temptation to give up the whole effort nor the temptation to give up our insistence on vital and responsible safeguards.&lt;ref name=au&gt;{{cite speech |title=1963 Commencement |last=Kennedy |first=John F. |author-link=John F.

Kennedy proceeded to announce an agreement with Khrushchev and Macmillan to promptly resume comprehensive test-ban negotiations in Moscow and a US decision to unilaterally halt atmospheric tests.&lt;ref name=au/&gt; The speech was well received by Khrushchev, who later called it "the greatest speech by any American President since [[Franklin D. Roosevelt|Roosevelt]],"{{sfn|Schlesinger|2002|p=904}} though was met with some skepticism within the US. The speech was endorsed by Humphrey and other Democrats, but labeled a "dreadful mistake" by Republican Senator [[Barry Goldwater]] and "another case of concession" by [[Everett Dirksen]], the leader of the Senate Republicans. Dirksen and [[Charles A. Halleck]], the second-ranking [[United States House of Representatives|House]] Republican, warned that the renewed negotiations might end in "virtual surrender."&lt;ref name=cq/&gt;

Due to prior experience in arms control and his personal relationship with Khrushchev, former [[United States Assistant Secretary of War|Assistant Secretary of War]] [[John J. McCloy]] was first considered the likely choice for chief US negotiator in Moscow, but his name was withdrawn after he turned out to be unavailable over the summer. [[W. Averell Harriman]], a former ambassador to the Soviet Union well respected in Moscow, was chosen instead.{{sfn|Schlesinger|2002|pp=902–903}} The US delegation would also include [[Adrian S. Fisher]], [[Carl Kaysen]], [[John McNaughton (government official)|John McNaughton]], and [[William R. Tyler]]. In Britain, Macmillan initially wanted David Ormsby-Gore, who had just completed a term as foreign minister, to lead his delegation, but there were concerns that Ormsby-Gore would appear to be a US "stooge" (Kennedy described him as "the brightest man he ever knew").{{sfn|Seaborg|1981|p=15}} Instead, Macmillan chose [[Quintin Hogg, Baron Hailsham of St Marylebone|Quintin Hogg]]. [[Arthur M. Schlesinger Jr.]], a special advisor to Kennedy, believed that Hogg was "ill prepared on the technicalities of the problem and was consumed by a desire to get a treaty at almost any cost."{{sfn|Schlesinger|2002|p=905}} [[Andrei Gromyko]], the Soviet [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Soviet Union)|Minister of Foreign Affairs]], served as Moscow's emissary.{{sfn|Schlesinger|2002|p=906}}

Heading into the negotiations, there was still no resolution within the Kennedy Administration of the question of whether to pursue a comprehensive or partial ban. In an effort to achieve the former, Britain proposed reducing the number of mandated inspections to allay Soviet concerns, but Harriman believed such a reduction would have to be paired with other concessions that Khrushchev would be able to show off within the Soviet Union and to China. Withdrawing [[PGM-19 Jupiter]] missiles from [[Italy]] and [[Turkey]] would have been an option, had they not already been removed in the wake of the Cuban Missile Crisis. In meetings prior to the negotiations, Kennedy informed Harriman that he would be willing to make concessions on the [[Berlin]] question.{{sfn|Schlesinger|2002|pp=903–904}}

On 2 July 1963, Khrushchev proposed a partial ban on tests in the atmosphere, outer space, and underwater, which would avoid the contentious issue of detecting underground tests. Notably, Khrushchev did not link this proposal to a moratorium on underground tests (as had been proposed earlier), but said it should be followed by a [[non-aggression pact]] between [[NATO]] and the [[Warsaw Pact]].{{sfn|Schlesinger|2002|p=904}} "A test ban agreement combined with the signing of a non-aggression pact between the two groups of state will create a fresh international climate more favorable for a solution of the major problems of our time, including disarmament," Khrushchev said.&lt;ref name=khrushchevspeech&gt;{{cite speech |title=Excerpt from Chairman Khrushchev's Speech |last=Khrushchev |first=Nikita |author-link=Nikita Khrushchev |date=2 July 1963 |location=[[East Berlin]] |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ojBXI7fmRKIC&amp;lpg=PA1001&amp;ots=JABo9o1_wA&amp;dq=a%20test%20ban%20agreement%2C%20%22combined%20with%20the%20simultaneous%20signing%20of&amp;pg=PA1000#v=onepage&amp;q=a%20test%20ban%20agreement,%20%22combined%20with%20the%20simultaneous%20signing%20of&amp;f=false |access-date=7 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the nuclear powers pursued a test ban agreement, they also sought to contend with a rising communist China, which at the time was pursuing its own [[China and weapons of mass destruction#Nuclear weapons|nuclear program]]. In 1955, [[Mao Zedong]] expressed to the Soviet Union his belief that China could withstand a first nuclear strike and more than 100 million casualties. In the 1950s, the Soviet Union assisted the Chinese nuclear program, but stopped short of providing China with an actual nuclear bomb, which was followed by [[Sino-Soviet split|increasingly tense relations]] in the late 1950s and early 1960s. Khrushchev began the test-ban talks of 1958 with minimal prior discussion with China, and the two countries' agreement on military-technology cooperation was terminated in June 1959.&lt;ref name=wilsoncenter&gt;{{cite web |title=Sharing the Bomb among Friends: The Dilemmas of Sino-Soviet Strategic Cooperation |url=https://www.wilsoncenter.org/publication/sharing-the-bomb-among-friends-the-dilemmas-sino-soviet-strategic-cooperation |publisher=[[Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars]] |last=Jersild |first=Austin |date=8 October 2013 |accessdate=7 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to the Moscow negotiations of the summer of 1963, Kennedy granted Harriman significant latitude in reaching a "Soviet-American understanding" vis-à-vis China.{{sfn|Schlesinger|2002|p=904}} Secret Sino-Soviet talks in July 1963 revealed further discord between the two communist powers, as the Soviet Union released a statement that it did not "share the views of the Chinese leadership about creating 'a thousand times higher civilization' on the corpses of hundreds of millions of people." The Soviet Union also issued an ideological critique of China's nuclear policy, declaring that China's apparent openness to nuclear war was "in crying contradiction to the idea of [[Marxism-Leninism]]," as a nuclear war would "not distinguish between imperialists and working people."{{sfn|Schlesinger|2002|p=905}}

The negotiations were inaugurated on 15 July 1963 at the [[Kremlin]] with Khrushchev in attendance. Khrushchev reiterated that the Anglo-American inspection plan would amount to espionage, effectively dismissing the possibility of a comprehensive ban. Following the script of his 3 July 1963 speech, Khrushchev did not demand a simultaneous moratorium on underground testing and instead proposed a non-aggression pact. Under instruction from Washington, Harriman replied that the US would explore the possibility of a non-aggression pact in good faith, but indicated that while a test ban could be quickly completed, a non-aggression pact would require lengthy discussions. Additionally, such a pact would complicate the issue of Western access to [[West Berlin]]. Harriman also took the opportunity to propose a non-proliferation agreement with would bar the transfer of nuclear weapons between countries. Khrushchev said that such an agreement should be considered in the future, but in the interim, a test ban would have the same effect on limiting proliferation.{{sfn|Schlesinger|2002|pp=905–906}}

Following initial discussions, Gromyko and Harriman began examining drafts of a test-ban agreement. First, language in the drafted preamble appeared to Harriman to prohibit the use of nuclear weapons in self-defense, which Harriman insisted be clarified. Harriman additionally demanded that an explicit clause concerning withdrawal from the agreement be added to the treaty; Khrushchev believed that each state had a sovereign right to withdraw, which should simply be assumed. Harriman informed Gromyko that without a clause governing withdrawal, which he believed the US Senate would demand, the US could not assent.{{sfn|Schlesinger|2002|pp=906–907}} Ultimately, the two sides settled upon compromise language:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Each Party shall in exercising its national sovereignty have the right to withdraw from the Treaty if it decides that extraordinary events, related to the subject matter of this Treaty, have jeopardized the supreme interests of its country.{{sfn|Schlesinger|2002|p=907}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Gromyko and Harriman debated how states not universally recognized (e.g., [[East Germany]] and China) could join the agreement. The US proposed asserting that accession to the treaty would not indicate international recognition. This was rejected by the Soviet Union. Eventually, with Kennedy's approval, US envoys Fisher and McNaughton devised a system whereby multiple government would serve as [[Depositary|depositaries]] for the treaty, allowing individual states to sign only the agreement held by the government of their choice in association with other like-minded states. This solution, which overcame one of the more challenging roadblocks in the negotiations, also served to allay mounting concerns from Macmillan, which were relayed to Washington, that an agreement would once again be derailed.{{sfn|Schlesinger|2002|pp=907–908}} Finally, in an original Soviet draft, the signature of France would have been required for the treaty to come into effect. At Harriman's insistence, this requirement was removed.{{sfn|Strode|1990|p=21}}

[[File:President Kennedy address on Test Ban Treaty, 26 July 1963.jpg|thumb|[[John F. Kennedy|Kennedy]] announces the agreement on 26 July 1963]]
The agreement was initialed on 25 July 1963, just 10 days after negotiations commenced. The following day, Kennedy delivered a 26-minute televised address on the agreement, declaring that since the invention of nuclear weapons, "all mankind has been struggling to escape from the darkening prospect of mass destruction on earth&amp;nbsp;... Yesterday a shaft of light cut into the darkness." Kennedy expressed hope that the test ban would be the first step towards broader rapprochement, limit nuclear fallout, restrict nuclear proliferation, and slow the arms race in such a way that fortifies US security. Kennedy concluded his address in reference to a Chinese [[proverb]] that he had used with Khrushchev in Vienna two years prior. "'A journey of a thousand miles must begin with a single step,'" Kennedy said. "And if that journey is a thousand miles, or even more, let history record that we, in this land, at this time, took the first step."{{sfn|Schlesinger|2002|p=910}}&lt;ref name=jfktv&gt;{{cite speech |title=Address to the Nation on the Nuclear Test Ban Treaty |last=Kennedy |first=John F. |author-link=John F.

In a speech in Moscow following the agreement, Khrushchev declared that the treaty would not end the arms race and by itself could not "avert the danger of war," and reiterated his proposal of a NATO-Warsaw Pact non-aggression accord.&lt;ref name=cq/&gt; For Khrushchev, the test ban negotiations had long been a means of improving the Soviet Union's global image and reducing strain in relations with the West.{{sfn|Strode|1990|p=24}} There are also some indications that military experts within the Soviet Union saw a test ban as a way to restrict US development of [[tactical nuclear weapon]]s, which could have increased US willingness to deploy small nuclear weapons on battlefields while circumventing the Soviet nuclear [[deterrence theory|deterrent]].{{sfn|Strode|1990|p=26}} Concern that a comprehensive ban would retard modernization of the Soviet arsenal may have pushed Khrushchev towards a partial ban.{{sfn|Strode|1990|p=27}} Counteracting the move towards a partial ban was Khrushchev's interest in reducing spending on testing, as underground testing was more expensive than the atmospheric tests the Soviet Union had been conducting; Khrushchev preferred a comprehensive ban as it would have eliminated the cost of testing entirely.{{sfn|Evangelista|1999|p=88}} Furthermore, there was internal concern about nuclear proliferation, particularly regarding the prospect of France and China crossing the threshold and the possibility of a multilateral NATO nuclear force, which was seen as a step towards West Germany acquiring nuclear weapons (the first Soviet test ban proposal in 1955 was made in the same month than West Germany joined NATO).{{sfn|Strode|1990|pp=28–29}}

It was not until after the agreement was reached that the negotiators broached the question of France and China joining the treaty. Harriman proposed to Khrushchev that the US lobby France while the Soviet Union pursued a Chinese signature. "That's your problem," Khrushchev said in reply.{{sfn|Schlesinger|2002|p=908}} Earlier, the Soviet ambassador to the US, Mikhail A. Menshikov, reportedly asked whether the US could "deliver the French."{{sfn|Strode|1990|p=29}} Both Kennedy and Macmillan personally called on de Gaulle to join, offering assistance to the French nuclear program in return.{{sfn|Jacobson|Stein|1966|p=465}} Nevertheless, on 29 July 1963, France announced it would not join the treaty. It was followed by China two days later.&lt;ref name=cq/&gt;

On 5 August 1963, British Foreign Secretary [[Alec Douglas-Home]], Soviet foreign minister Gromyko, and US Secretary of State [[Dean Rusk]] signed the final agreement.&lt;ref name=statedept/&gt;&lt;ref name=faschron/&gt;

====After the Moscow agreement====
Between 8 and 27 August 1963, the [[United States Senate Committee on Foreign Relations]] held hearings on the treaty. The Kennedy administration largely presented a united front in favor of the deal. Leaders of the once-opposed Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS) and AEC acknowledged that the treaty would be of net benefit, though Teller, former members of the JCS and AEC, and the commander of the [[Strategic Air Command]] made clear their firm opposition.{{sfn|Polsby|1984|p=72}} The opponents' argument centered on four themes. First, banning atmospheric tests would prevent the US from ensuring the [[radiation hardening|hardness]] of its [[LGM-30 Minuteman]] missile silos and, second, from developing a capable [[missile defense]] system. Third, it was argued that the Soviet Union led the US in high-yield weapons (recall the Soviet Tsar Bomba test of 1961), which required atmospheric testing banned by the treaty, while the US led the Soviet Union in low-yield weapons, which were tested underground and would be permitted by the treaty. Fourth, the ban would prevent [[Peaceful nuclear explosion|peaceful, civilian uses of nuclear detonations]]. Teller declared that the treaty would be a "step away from safety and possibly&amp;nbsp;... toward war."&lt;ref name=cq/&gt;
[[Image:President Kennedy signs Nuclear Test Ban Treaty, 07 October 1963.jpg|thumb|250px|right|[[John F. Kennedy|Kennedy]] signs the PTBT on 7 October 1963 before [[W. Averell Harriman]],  [[Lyndon B. Johnson]], [[Dean Rusk]], and others]]
Administration testimony sought to counteract these arguments. Defense Secretary Robert McNamara announced his "unequivocal support" for the treaty before the Foreign Relations Committee, arguing that US nuclear forces were secure and clearly superior to those of the Soviet Union, and that any major Soviet tests would be detected. [[Glenn T. Seaborg]], the chairman of the AEC, also gave his support to the treaty in testimony, as did [[Harold Brown (Secretary of Defense)|Harold Brown]], the Department of Defense's lead scientist, and [[Norris Bradbury]], the longtime director of the Los Alamos Laboratory. [[Maxwell D. Taylor]], the [[Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff]], also testified in favor of the deal. Taylor and other members of the JCS, including [[Curtis LeMay]], had made their support for the treaty conditional on four "safeguards": (1) a continued, aggressive underground testing program, (2) continued nuclear research programs, (3) continued readiness to resume atmospheric tests, and (4) improved verification equipment. Kennedy emphasized that the US would retain the ability to use nuclear weapons in war, would not be bound by the treaty if the Soviets violated it, and would continue an aggressive underground testing program. Kennedy also stressed that a ban would be a key step in preventing nuclear war.&lt;ref name=cq/&gt;

The testimonies of the Joint Chiefs were seen as particularly effective in allaying concerns, as were the reassurances issued by Kennedy, who had acquired a reputation for resoluteness against the Soviet Union in the wake of the Cuban Missile Crisis. Additionally, a number of prominent [[Republican Party (United States)|Republicans]] came out in support of the deal, including Eisenhower, Eisenhower's vice president [[Richard Nixon]], and Senator Everett Dirksen, who had initially been skeptical of the treaty. Eisenhower's science advisor and former PSAC head, George Kistiakowsky, endorsed the treaty. Former President Harry S. Truman also lent his support. Supporters of the deal mounted a significant pressure campaign, with active lobbying in favor by a range of civilian groups, including the [[United Automobile Workers]]/[[AFL-CIO]], the [[Peace Action|National Committee for a Sane Nuclear Policy]], [[Women Strike for Peace]], and [[Methodism|Methodist]], [[Unitarian Universalism|Unitarian Universalist]], and [[Reform Judaism|Reform Jewish]] organizations. Jerome Wiesner, the chairman of PSAC, later said that this public advocacy was a primary motivation for Kennedy's push for a test ban.{{sfn|Evangelista|1999|p=88}} Civil opposition to the deal was less prominent, though the [[Veterans of Foreign Wars]] announced opposition to the deal along with the [[International Council of Christian Churches]], which rejected a "covenant with a [[Religion in the Soviet Union|godless power]]." Polling in late August 1963 indicated that more than 60% of Americans supported the deal while less than 20% opposed it.&lt;ref name=cq/&gt;{{sfn|Terchek|1970|pp=135–136}}

On 3 September 1963, the Foreign Relations Committee approved the treaty by a 16–1 vote. On 24 September 1963, the US Senate voted 80–14 to approve ratification of the treaty, exceeding the necessary two-thirds majority by 14 votes. The Soviet Union ratified the treaty the following day with a unanimous vote of the [[Presidium of the Supreme Soviet]].{{sfn|Jacobson|Stein|1966|p=464}} On 10 October 1963, the treaty entered into effect.&lt;ref name=cq/&gt;&lt;ref name=armcontrol.org&gt;{{cite web |title=Nuclear Testing and Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT) Timeline |publisher=[[Arms Control Association]] |last1=Kimball |first1=Daryl G. |last2=Taheran |first2=Shervin |url=https://www.armscontrol.org/factsheets/Nuclear-Testing-and-Comprehensive-Test-Ban-Treaty-CTBT-Timeline |date=22 September 2015 |accessdate=11 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=unoda/&gt;

==Implementation==
===Provisions===

The treaty declares as its "principal aim the speediest possible achievement of an agreement on general and complete disarmament under strict international control," and explicitly states the goal of achieving a comprehensive test ban (i.e., one which bans underground tests). The treaty permanently forbids the parties to the treaty from conducting, permitting, or encouraging any nuclear explosion in the atmosphere, outer space, or underwater, as well as "any other nuclear explosion" that threatens to send nuclear debris into another state's territory.&lt;ref name=unoda&gt;{{cite web |title=Treaty Banning Nuclear Weapon Tests in the Atmosphere, in Outer Space and Under Water |publisher=[[United Nations Office for Disarmament Affairs]] |accessdate=11 August 2016 |url=http://disarmament.un.org/treaties/t/test_ban/text}}&lt;/ref&gt; The wording "any other nuclear explosion" prohibited peaceful nuclear explosions, due to the difficulty in differentiating those from military tests without expanded verification measures.&lt;ref name=statedept/&gt;

Per the compromise forged by US delegates Adrian S. Fisher and John McNaughton in Moscow, the third article of the treaty allows states to deposit instruments of ratification or accession with the government of Britain, the Soviet Union, or US, thereby avoiding the issue of the treaty appearing to legitimize governments lacking universal recognition.{{sfn|Schlesinger|2002|pp=907–908}} The fourth article reflects the compromise struck by Gromyko and Harriman in Moscow on departure from the treaty. It recognizes the sovereign right of states to withdraw from treaties, as Khrushchev argued, while explicitly granting parties the right to withdraw if "extraordinary events&amp;nbsp;... have jeopardized the supreme interests of its country," per the US demand.{{sfn|Schlesinger|2002|pp=906–907}}&lt;ref name=unoda/&gt;

The PTBT's ratification coincided with the beginning of a steep decline in the presence of radioactive particles in the atmosphere (following a "bomb spike" in the early 1960s), but did not halt nuclear proliferation.&lt;ref name=atomicheritage/&gt;&lt;ref name=radiocarbon/&gt;{{sfn|Burns|Siracusa|2013|p=532}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Ending Nuclear Testing |publisher=United Nations |url=https://www.un.org/en/events/againstnucleartestsday/history.shtml |accessdate=12 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Technical Details: The Bomb Spike |publisher=[[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]] |url=http://www.esrl.noaa.gov/gmd/outreach/isotopes/bombspike.html |accessdate=12 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; One year after the PTBT's entry into force, China (a non-signatory) conducted the [[596 (nuclear test)|596 test]] and became the world's fifth nuclear power.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=16 October 1964 – First Chinese Nuclear Test |url=https://www.ctbto.org/specials/testing-times/16-october-1964-first-chinese-nuclear-test |publisher=CTBTO Preparatory Commission |accessdate=3 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since China, [[List of states with nuclear weapons|four other states]] are known or believed to have acquired nuclear weapons. However, the PTBT has been credited with ''slowing'' proliferation due to the greater expense associated with underground tests.{{sfn|Rhodes|2008|p=72}} Kennedy had warned in 1963 that without a test ban there could be 10 nuclear states by 1970 and 15–20 by 1975.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Test Ban Treaty |last=Delcoigne |first=G.C. |publisher=[[IAEA]] |url=https://www.iaea.org/sites/default/files/publications/magazines/bulletin/bull15-4/15403500322.pdf |page=8 |accessdate=11 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The decade following ratification of the PTBT (1963–72) featured more US nuclear tests than the decade prior (1953–62). In the following decade, the US conducted 385 nuclear tests and 23 peaceful nuclear explosions (PNEs), versus 268 tests and three PNEs in the preceding decade. In contrast, the number of Soviet detonations fell from 218 in the preceding decade to 157 in the following decade, as the Soviet Union was never able to meet the pace of US underground explosions.{{sfn|Evangelista|1999|pp=85–86}} China and France, both non-signatories, conducted 53 tests between 1963 and 1973. In all, 436 tests were conducted between the signing of the PTBT and 1 July 1973, compared to 499 tests between 16 July 1945 and the signing of the PTBT.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Test Ban Treaty |last=Delcoigne |first=G.C. |publisher=IAEA |page=18 |url=https://www.iaea.org/sites/default/files/publications/magazines/bulletin/bull15-4/15403500322.pdf |accessdate=11 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1960s and 1970s, China conducted 22 atmospheric tests and France conducted 50.&lt;ref name=nsarchive/&gt; The last atmospheric test was conducted by China in 1980, after French atmospheric testing stopped in 1974.&lt;ref name=faschron/&gt;&lt;ref name=nsa2/&gt; Public opposition to nuclear testing continued following the treaty's enactment. [[Greenpeace]] was founded in 1971 in opposition to a planned underground test on the [[Alaska]]n island of [[Amchitka]]. In 1982, a Greenpeace ship docked at Leningrad without permission demanding that the Soviet Union stop testing.{{sfn|Evangelista|1999|pp=168–170}}

The PTBT was a first of a series of nuclear arms control treaties in the second half of 20th century. The PTBT has been considered the stepping stone to the [[Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons]] (NPT) of 1968, which made explicit reference to the progress provided by the PTBT.&lt;ref name=faschron/&gt; In addition to the NPT, the PTBT was followed within ten years by the [[Outer Space Treaty]] and [[Treaty of Tlatelolco]] in 1967, [[Seabed Arms Control Treaty]] in 1971, and the [[Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty]] in 1972.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Test Ban Treaty |last=Delcoigne |first=G.C. |publisher=IAEA |pages=8, 18 |url=https://www.iaea.org/sites/default/files/publications/magazines/bulletin/bull15-4/15403500322.pdf |accessdate=11 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1974, the [[Threshold Test Ban Treaty]] prohibited underground tests with yields above 150 kilotons.&lt;ref name=nsa2/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Flawed Test Ban Treaty |publisher=[[The Heritage Foundation]] |date=27 March 1984 |url=http://www.heritage.org/research/reports/1984/03/the-flawed-test-ban-treaty |accessdate=12 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 1977, the original parties to the PTBT renewed discussion of a comprehensive test ban in Geneva. Through the end of the 1970s, the US, UK, and Soviet Union reached agreement on draft provisions prohibiting all testing, temporarily banning PNEs, and establishing a verification system including on-site inspections. However, the sides remained at odds over the precise details of verification and talks would permanently disband with the departure of President [[Jimmy Carter]] in 1981.&lt;ref name=faschron/&gt;

Momentum towards a comprehensive ban reemerged under [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] and President [[Ronald Reagan]], with Gorbachev initiating a testing moratorium in 1985. In December 1986, the US indicated support for the "long-term objective" of a comprehensive ban, followed by the commencement of testing negotiations between the US and Soviet Union in November 1987. In December 1987, the US and Soviet Union agreed to a joint program of experiments on detecting underground tests.&lt;ref name=faschron/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=In Remotest Nevada, a Joint U.S. and Soviet Test |last=Blakeslee |first=Sandra |date=18 August 1988 |work=The New York Times |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1988/08/18/world/in-remotest-nevada-a-joint-us-and-soviet-test.html |accessdate=11 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 1988, [[Indonesia]], [[Mexico]], [[Peru]], [[Sri Lanka]], [[Venezuela]], and [[Yugoslavia]] petitioned to transform the PTBT into a comprehensive ban by extending the treaty to underground tests. At a conference on the plan in January 1991, the US indicated it would not permit efforts to achieve a comprehensive ban by consensus with amendments to the PTBT.&lt;ref name=statedept/&gt;

Throughout the 1990s, progress accelerated towards a comprehensive test ban treaty (CTBT). Following a series of international meetings on the subject, the [[UN General Assembly]] approved resolution 50/64, which appealed for states to follow the PTBT and called for conclusion of the CTBT talks. In September 1996, the [[Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty]] was signed and superseded the PTBT, though the PTBT is still in effect for states not party to the CTBT.&lt;ref name=nti/&gt; The CTBT has yet to enter into force, as 8 required states have not ratified the treaty, including the US and China.

Additionally, "venting" of underground tests by the US and Soviet Union also continued to release radioactive debris into the atmosphere.&lt;ref name=nsa2/&gt; Fully contained underground tests were not wholly "clean" either. Underground testing reduced the risk caused by [[radionuclide]]s with short [[Half-life|half-lives]], such as [[iodine-131]], and is generally safer than other forms of testing. However, underground testing may also cause long-lived radionuclides, including [[caesium-135]], [[iodine-129]], and [[plutonium]], to seep into the ground.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=General Overview of the Effects of Nuclear Testing |publisher=CTBTO Preparatory Commission |url=https://www.ctbto.org/nuclear-testing/the-effects-of-nuclear-testing/general-overview-of-theeffects-of-nuclear-testing/ |accessdate=12 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report |title=Report on the Health Consequences to the American Population from Nuclear Weapons Tests Conducted by the United States and Other Nations |chapter=Fallout from Nuclear Weapons |publisher=[[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] |date=May 2005 |pages=20–21 |url=https://www.cdc.gov/nceh/radiation/fallout/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A notable atmospheric release of radioactive gas followed the Soviet [[Chagan (nuclear test)|Chagan test]] of 15 January 1965 in present-day [[Kazakhstan]]. Roughly 20% of the radioactive debris produced by the 140-kiloton detonation was released into the atmosphere, with some fallout occurring over Japan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.ctbto.org/nuclear-testing/the-effects-of-nuclear-testing/the-soviet-unionsnuclear-testing-programme/page-3-effects-of-nuclear-weapon-testing-by-the-soviet-union/ |title=Page 3: Effects of Nuclear Weapon Testing by the Soviet Union |publisher=CTBTO Preparatory Commission |accessdate=12 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The US complained to Moscow, but no subsequent action was taken.{{Citation needed|date=September 2016}} On 25 April 1966, the ''Pin Stripe'' underground test in Nevada (part of [[Operation Flintlock (nuclear test)|Operation Flintlock]]) experienced a venting malfunction and produced a radioactive plume headed towards the [[Midwestern United States|Midwestern US]]; the AEC determined that the test did not threaten human health.&lt;ref name=nsa2/&gt;

Another accidental release occurred following the [[Yucca Flat#Baneberry|''Baneberry'']] shot at the Nevada Test Site on 18 December 1970 (part of [[Operation Emery]]). The 10-kiloton underground detonation produced a fissure in the ground, which subsequently allowed radioactive gas to escape into the atmosphere.&lt;ref name=bane2&gt;{{cite web |title=Three-dimensional Simulation of the Baneberry Nuclear Event |publisher=[[Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory]] |last=Antoun |first=Tarabay H. |url=https://asc.llnl.gov/news/news_archive/baneberry.pdf |accessdate=12 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Radioactive material released by the fissure reached an altitude of {{convert|10,000|ft|m|sp=us}} and exposed 86 workers to radiation, though none at excessive levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081110112057/http://www.brookings.edu/projects/archive/nucweapons/nts.aspx |title=Nuclear Testing at the Nevada Test Site |publisher=[[Brookings Institution]] |date=August 1998 |url=http://www.brookings.edu/projects/archive/nucweapons/nts.aspx |archive-date=10 November 2008 |accessdate=12 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The incident has since been described as one of the "world's worst nuclear disasters."&lt;ref name=bane&gt;{{cite web |title=The Worst Nuclear Disasters – Photo Gallery – TIME |publisher=[[Time (magazine)|''Time'']] |url=http://content.time.com/time/photogallery/0,29307,1887705_1862274,00.html |accessdate=31 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Declassified US documents indicate that the US may have violated the PTBT's ban on atmospheric testing in 1972 by, at the instruction of [[Henry Kissinger]], monitoring and collecting data on French atmospheric tests over the Pacific Ocean, which may have amounted to cooperation with the French program. Declassified documents also indicate that the US and UK circumvented the prescribed verification system in 1964–65 by establishing a series of additional control posts in [[Australia]], [[Fiji]], [[Mauritius]], [[Pakistan]], and [[South Africa]].&lt;ref name=nsa2&gt;{{cite web |title=The Limited Test Ban Treaty – 50 Years Later: New Documents Throw Light on Accord Banning Atmospheric Nuclear Testing |last=Burr |first=William |publisher=National Security Archive |date=2 August 2013 |url=http://nsarchive.gwu.edu/nukevault/ebb433/ |accessdate=12 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Patexia Inc.''' is a privately held [[intellectual property]] (IP) company based in [[Santa Monica]], [[California]], U.S. The company was founded in 2010 with the mission to enhance transparency and efficiency in the IP field&lt;ref name="Kar"&gt;{{cite web|author1=Jessica Karmasek|title=Initiative offers companies a better way to fight costly, frivolous patent litigation|url=http://legalnewsline.com/stories/510636581-initiative-offers-companies-a-better-way-to-fight-costly-frivolous-patent-litigation|website=Legal News Line|publisher=Legal News Line|accessdate=11 November 2016|date=3 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; through a leveraging of the knowledge of an IP-based online community of researchers, attorneys, and stakeholders—described by the company as a “multidisciplinary social network”—for the purpose of information [[crowdsourcing]]. In addition, the company combines patent and litigation databases to provide analytical tools regarding the IP field, including the details of attorneys, law firms, companies, and [[examiner (patent)|examiners]], for its community members.&lt;ref name="Kar2"&gt;{{cite web|author1=Jessica M. Karmasek|title=CEO, IP expert: ‘Crowdsourcing’ improves exam process, makes for stronger patents|url=http://legalnewsline.com/stories/510628278-ceo-ip-expert-lsquo-crowdsourcing-rsquo-improves-exam-process-makes-for-stronger-patents|website=Legal News Line|publisher=Legal News Line|accessdate=11 November 2016|date=19 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Pat"&gt;{{cite web|title=Patexia Announces the Launch of its First Online Contest|url=https://www.patexia.com/pressrelease/view/id/6|website=Patexia|publisher=Patexia, Inc|accessdate=11 November 2016|date=17 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2015, company founder and [[CEO]] Pedram Sameni claimed that client feedback formed the basis of a “track record … of 75 percent of cases” regarding successful relevant-[[prior art|prior-art]] searches.&lt;ref name="Cic"&gt;{{cite web|author1=Amanda Ciccatelli|title=Patexia uses the power of crowdsourcing to control patent-litigation costs|url=http://www.insidecounsel.com/2015/03/27/patexia-uses-the-power-of-crowdsourcing-to-control?slreturn=1478860791#!|website=Inside Counsel|publisher=ALM Media, LLC|accessdate=11 November 2016|date=27 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of November 2016, Patexia is officially partnered with the [[United States Department of Health and Human Services|U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS)]], [[Yahoo, Inc.]], and [[NASA]]. In June 2015, the company was awarded one of 10 new NASA Open Innovation Service (NOIS) Contracts regarding “human space exploration challenges.”&lt;ref name="NASA"&gt;{{cite web|author1=Brian Dunbar|title=NASA Uses Crowdsourcing for Open Innovation Contracts|url=http://www.nasa.gov/press-release/nasa-uses-crowdsourcing-for-open-innovation-contracts|website=NASA|publisher=National Aeronautics and Space Administration|accessdate=11 November 2016|date=5 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The company was founded in 2010 by Sameni, whose aim was to address the inefficiency that he observed in the IP field while working in a management role at the IP and [[licensing]] department of U.S. power-management-technology company International Rectifier (now part of [[Infineon Technologies]]). Sameni explained to the ''Legal NewsLine'' publication in December 2014 that the considerable IP portfolio he was responsible for at International Rectifier revealed major issues regarding the conventional patent processes including the immense backlog “burden” of the [[United States Patent and Trademark Office|United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO)]], which Pedram states was left with more than 600,000 outstanding patent applications at the end of [[fiscal year|Fiscal Year]] 2014.&lt;ref name="Kar2" /&gt;

Sameni eventually identified crowdsourcing as a viable alternative to traditional prior art search, as “the most relevant prior art references are [most-often] hidden in non-patent-literature or foreign language documents;”&lt;ref name="Kar2" /&gt; that is, given that the compulsory research of each prior-art application is performed by an individual examiner in the U.S., the employment of a research community means that multi-lingual searches can be conducted by tens of thousands of individuals with access to global publications, thereby resulting in a significant efficiency and quality improvement. In December 2014, Sameni explained:

&lt;blockquote&gt;A global crowd of thousands or millions is not bound by the restrictions that apply to an individual or even a single company. If you pose a question to the crowd, they can respond with knowledge across many industries and search for responses in dozens of languages. The crowd takes a variety of creative approaches not bound by a single set of cultural or educational norms, which leads to emergent behavior and new and innovative solutions … patterns often emerge that may otherwise have been overlooked at the individual level.”&lt;ref name="Kar2" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In March 2011, Patexia released the [[Software release life cycle#BETA|beta]] version of its first research tool, the “IP Research” platform, to the public. Described by the blog of international patent-search business Landon IP (now part of [[CPA Global]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Our Story|url=https://www.cpaglobal.com/about-us/our-story/|website=CPA Global|publisher=CPA Global|accessdate=11 November 2016|date=2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;) as a “free patent search system with simple visual analysis tools,”&lt;ref name="Int"&gt;{{cite web|title=Patexia Visualization of US Patent Data: A Free Online Tool|url=https://intellogist.wordpress.com/2011/05/31/patexia-visualization-of-us-patent-data-a-free-online-tool/|website=Intellogist|publisher=Landon IP|accessdate=11 November 2016|format=Wordpress|date=31 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Patexia [[press release]] explained that the platform “covers [the] U.S. patent database from 1976 to late 2010, which includes over 4.1M patents.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Patexia Announces Public Beta Release of IP Research|url=https://www.patexia.com/pressrelease/view/id/3|website=Patexia|publisher=Patexia, Inc|accessdate=11 November 2016|date=14 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In early 2011, the official Patexia blog was also commenced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Jeremy|title=Monday miscellany|url=http://ipkitten.blogspot.com/2011/05/monday-miscellany_16.html|website=The IPKat|publisher=The IPKat|accessdate=11 November 2016|date=16 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2012, the first-ever Patexia crowdsourcing contest was launched. Participants were required to submit “a new or existing idea that reduces health care costs,” and two [[United States dollar|US$]]1,000 prizes were offered. One of the winners was determined by Patexia judges, while a popular vote was used for the other winner.&lt;ref name="Pat" /&gt;

At the start of 2013, Patexia was identified by ''[[Bloomberg News]]'', alongside other crowdsourced IP firms like [[Article One Partners]] (bigger in size than Patexia itself), for its potential in the patent-litigation area, as a [[PricewaterhouseCoopers]] U.S. study indicated that the number of filed patent actions had tripled between 1991 and 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author1=Olga Kharif|title=Crowdsourcing the Fight Against Tech Patent Trolls|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2013-01-17/crowdsourcing-the-fight-against-tech-patent-trolls|accessdate=11 November 2016|work=Bloomberg|publisher=Bloomberg LP|date=18 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Regarding litigation matters, Sameni stated in 2014: “Crowdsourcing is an extremely efficient way to search for evidence of use and locate infringing products across different markets.”&lt;ref name="Kar2" /&gt;

In March 2015, the “Patexia.Defend” program was launched with respect to the patent-litigation area. Again, crowdsourcing underpins the program that was developed to help reduce the monetary costs for technology-sector clients facing a high number of patent-litigation cases. During the launch, active membership programs were offered in terms of the [[semiconductor]] sub-sectors such as [[wireless]] connectivity, [[flash memory]], and [[DRAM]].&lt;ref name="Cic" /&gt;

NASA published its press release regarding the awarding of 10 new NOIS contracts—the total combined value of which is $20 million over five years—in mid-2015, with Patexia listed among the recipients alongside other companies including InnoCentive, Inc. and HeroX PBC. The press release for the NASA Tournament Lab explained that the new contracts would initially be used to seek new algorithms for its [[Robonaut]] project for both space and Earth purposes, while NASA’s “evolvable Journey to Mars strategy” is the future research subject. NASA’s director of the Center of Excellence for Collaborative Innovation stated that the space organization wanted to exploit “the global nature of the internet to tap into the diverse intellects and talents available around the world.”&lt;ref name="NASA" /&gt;

Patexia’s activities regarding patent litigation were further developed with the launch of the “Patexia Coalition Funding Initiative” in September 2015. The Initiative’s aim is the reduction of expensive litigation costs through collective action that heightens efficiency, whereby “companies share the burdens they would otherwise face alone.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Amanda Ciccatelli|title=Patexia helps collaboratively fight frivolous patent litigation|url=http://www.insidecounsel.com/2015/09/01/patexia-helps-collaboratively-fight-frivolous-pate?slreturn=1478412309#!|website=Inside Counsel|publisher=ALM Media, LLC|accessdate=11 November 2016|date=1 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; By forming a “defense coalition,” Sameni explained that individual companies would only be liable for costs around the $50,000 mark, rather than the millions of dollars that can be incurred otherwise.&lt;ref name="Kar" /&gt;

==Products and Services==
Patexia’s primary aim was the provision of crowdsourced patent-search services through an online community of subject-matter experts, whereby studies are posted for the purpose of facilitating research and the relevant submissions in the form of different reference types are sought out. Since its founding, its business model has expanded to comprise four areas, as shown on its website.

===Contest===
The studies that Patexia engages in comprise the patent due diligence regarding [[litigation]] and licensing cases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About Us|url=https://www.patexia.com/about_us.html|website=Patexia|publisher=Patexia, Inc|accessdate=11 November 2016|date=2010–2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; To initiate the search process, contests, which are either private or public, are promoted by the company as “crowdsourced challenges” on its “Contest” Web page, as well as via an email list and an [[RSS]] feed. The details of the challenge, including the scoring criteria and the rules, are provided in the announcement.&lt;ref name="Pat2"&gt;{{cite web|title=Contest Rules|url=https://www.patexia.com/general_contest_rules.html|website=Patexia|publisher=Patexia, Inc|accessdate=11 November 2016|date=2010–2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Contest submissions are scored on a 100-point scale and according to the grading [[rubric]] that is included with the contest details. The highest-scoring submission is deemed the “winner,” and 60 percent of the overall prize pool is awarded. The contest rewards always vary, with $5,000 awarded to the winner of a “Tire Pressure Monitoring System” contest in October 2016.&lt;ref name="Pat2" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tire Pressure Monitoring System|url=https://www.patexia.com/contests/tire-pressure-monitoring-system|website=Patexia|publisher=Patexia, Inc|accessdate=11 November 2016|date=16 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Community===
Patexia-community members can use the “Community” platform to share news items, analyses/opinions, and IP reviews for which a specific intellectual asset is examined in detail. Patexia has linked the IP-review section to its patent database to show the “real value” of intellectual assets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Community Guide|url=https://www.patexia.com/community_guide.html|website=Patexia|publisher=Patexia, Inc|accessdate=11 November 2016|date=2010–2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Research===
Patexia hosts its searchable databases and visualization tools regarding U.S. patents, U.S.-patent [[lawsuit]]s, industry trends, company portfolios, and the details of patent professionals in its “Research” section. The visualization tool allows users to analyze the information, including the performance of a comparative analysis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Research Guide|url=https://www.patexia.com/research_guide.html|website=Patexia|publisher=Patexia, Inc|accessdate=11 November 2016|date=2010–2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Connect===
The “Connect” section of the Patexia website provides a “marketplace” for IP-employment opportunities in the legal and consultancy areas, with the openings including those for litigation associates, [[patent agents]], and technical consultants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Connect &gt; Find Intellectual Property Legal Jobs|url=https://www.patexia.com/connects/legal|website=Patexia|publisher=Patexia, Inc|accessdate=11 November 2016|date=2010–2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Innovation==
In addition to the promotion of efficiency, the “driving” of [[innovation]] has also been listed as an aim of Patexia, and Sameni has revealed his views on the progression of the IP field through the media. Regarding crowdsourcing, he said to ''Legal NewsLine'' in December 2014 that it can “help with [the] creative idea generation process” and can “serve as the foundation of future patents and innovation within an industry.”&lt;ref name="Kar2" /&gt;

Also in December 2014, he proposed an “initial opt-in” program to improve the efficiency of the USPTO, whereby “crowdsourced prior art research” would be merged with the organization’s patent-application process. Sameni cited the [[Pareto Principle]], which suggests “80 percent of outcomes are the result of 20 percent of causes,” explaining: “Essentially, we [Patexia] recommend that the USPTO apply crowdsourcing to ‘the 20 percent’ of patent applications thus increasing efficiency overall, rather than applying crowdsourcing to every application under review.”&lt;ref name="Kar2" /&gt;

Semani was invited to sit on a November 2014 USPTO [[Round table (discussion)|roundtable discussion]] regarding the use of crowdsourcing for the identification of the relevant prior art for patent applications.&lt;ref name="Kar2" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Jessica M. Karmasek|title=U.S. PTO considers using ‘crowdsourcing’ to head off patent trolls|url=http://legalnewsline.com/stories/510628058-u-s-pto-considers-using-lsquo-crowdsourcing-rsquo-to-head-off-patent-trolls|website=Legal News Line|publisher=Legal News Line|accessdate=11 November 2016|date=17 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The USPTO announcement stated that “crowdsourcing may be a promising way to uncover hard-to-find prior art, especially non-patent literature.”&lt;ref name="Kar" /&gt;

In March 2015, Sameni explained the importance of crowdsourcing in patent litigation to the ''[[InsideCounsel]]'' publication: “At the root of all of the recent controversy and debate, the real issue with the United States patent system is patent quality. If each patent was trusted to be an unimpeachable asset it would remove many of the reasons behind the high litigation rates we see today.”&lt;ref name="Cic" /&gt;

'''''Perez v. Sharp''''',&lt;ref&gt;32 Cal. 2d 711, 198 P. 2d 17 (Cal. 1948).&lt;/ref&gt; also known as '''Perez v. Lippold''' or '''Perez v. Moroney''', is a 1948 case decided by the [[Supreme Court of California]] in which the court held by a 4–3 majority that the state's ban on interracial [[marriage]] violated the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution]].

The three-justice plurality decision was authored by Associate Justice [[Roger J. Traynor]] who would later serve as the Court's [[Chief Justice of California|Chief Justice]]. Justice [[Douglas L. Edmonds]] wrote his own concurrence of the judgment, leading to a four-justice majority in favor of striking down the law. The dissent was written by Associate Justice [[John W. Shenk]], the second longest-serving member in the Court's history and a notable judicial conservative. The opinion was the first of any state to strike down an [[anti-miscegenation law in the United States]].

==Background==
Andrea Perez (a [[Mexican American]] woman) and Sylvester Davis (an [[African American]] man) met while working in the defense industry in Los Angeles.&lt;ref&gt;See Dara Orenstein, Void for Vagueness: Mexicans and the Collapse of Miscegenation Law in California, 74 Pac. Hist. Rev. 367, 367–368 (2005).&lt;/ref&gt;

Perez and Davis applied for a marriage license with the County Clerk of Los Angeles. On the application for a marriage license, Andrea Perez listed her race as "white", and Sylvester Davis identified himself as "Negro". Under the California law, individuals of Mexican ancestry generally were classified as white because of their [[Spanish people|Spanish]] heritage.

The [[County Clerk]], named W. G. Sharp, refused to issue the license based on [[California Civil Code]], Section 60: "All marriages of white persons with Negroes, Mongolians, members of the Malay race, or mulattoes are illegal and void" and on Section 69, which stated that "no license may be issued authorizing the marriage of a white person with a [[Negro]], [[mulatto]], [[Mongoloid race|Mongolian]] or member of the [[Malay race]]".&lt;ref&gt;California Civil Code, Section 69.&lt;/ref&gt; At the time, [[California]]'s anti-miscegenation statute had banned interracial marriage since 1850, when it first enacted a statute prohibiting whites from marrying blacks or [[mulattoes]].

Perez, represented by Attorney Daniel G. Marshall,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url= http://scholarship.law.berkeley.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1168&amp;context=californialawreview |title=Beyond Analogy: Perez v. Sharp, Antimiscegenation Law, and the Fight for Same-Sex Marriage - viewcontent.cgi |first=R. A.|last=Lenhardt |work=California Law Review |year=2015 |accessdate=27 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; petitioned the California Supreme Court for an original [[Mandamus|writ of mandamus]] to compel the issuance of the license. Perez and Davis were both Catholics and wanted a [[Catholic marriage]] with a [[Mass (Catholic Church)|Mass]].

One of their primary arguments, adopted by Justice Douglas Edmonds in his concurring opinion, was that the Church was willing to marry them and so the state's anti-miscegenation law infringed on their right to participate fully in the sacraments of their religion, including the sacrament of matrimony.&lt;ref&gt;Rachel F. Moran, "Loving and the Legacy of Unintended Consequences", 2007 ''Wis. L. Rev''. 239, 268.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Court opinion==
The court held that marriage is a fundamental right and that laws restricting that right must not be based solely on prejudice. The lead opinion by Justice Roger Traynor and joined by Chief Justice Phil Gibson and Justice Jesse Carter, held that restrictions due to discrimination violated the constitutional requirements of due process and equal protection of the laws. The court voided the California statute, holding that Section 69 of the California Civil Code was too vague and uncertain to be enforceable restrictions on the fundamental right of marriage and that they violated the Fourteenth Amendment by impairing the right to marry on the basis of race alone. In a separate concurring opinion, Justice Douglas Edmonds held that the statute violated the religious freedom of the plaintiffs, since the anti-miscegenation law infringed on their right to participate fully in the sacrament of matrimony.

==Significance==
By its decision in this case, the California Supreme Court became the first court of the 20th century to hold that a state [[anti-miscegenation law]] violates the US Constitution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Kennedy | first = Randall | authorlink = Randall Kennedy | title = Interracial Intimacies | publisher = [[Vintage Books]] | year = 2003 | pages = 259–266 | isbn = 0-375-70264-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It preceded ''[[Loving v. Virginia]]'', the case in which the [[United States Supreme Court]] invalidated all such state statutes, by 19 years, and antedated the civil rights milestones such as ''[[Brown v. Board of Education]]'' from which Loving benefited. Indeed, in ''Loving'', Chief Justice [[Earl Warren|Warren]] cited ''Perez'' in footnote 5, and at least one scholar has discussed the extent to which Perez influenced his opinion.&lt;ref&gt;See R.A. Lenhardt, "The Story of Perez v. Sharp: Forgotten Lessons on Race, Law, and Marriage", in ''Race Law Stories'' (Rachel F. Moran &amp; Devon Carbado eds., forthcoming 2008).&lt;/ref&gt;

''Perez'' was much of the basis for the California Supreme Court's 2008 decision, ''[[In re Marriage Cases]]'' (2008) 43 Cal. 4th 757, which declared that the California law restricting marriage to be between a man and a woman to be unconstitutional, on ''Perez''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4647">{{about||the concept of priority date in patent law|priority right|cut-off date movements of employment-based preferences|Visa Bulletin Employment-based Preferences Cut-off Dates}}
{{No footnotes|date=June 2014}}

'''Priority date''' is a [[United States]] immigration concept – it is the date when a principal applicant first reveals his intent of immigration to the US government. For family-sponsored applicants, the priority date is the date an immigration petition, filed on behalf of him or her, is received by the [[United States Citizenship and Immigration Services]] (USCIS). For employment-based immigration beneficiaries, the priority date is the date an immigration petition is filed at USCIS, under categories where a labor certification is not required, or when the [[United States Department of Labor]] receives a labor certification application, under categories where a labor certification is required. In all cases, the priority dates are not established until USCIS approves the immigration petition. The date establishes one's place in the queue for a family-sponsored or employment-based or permanent residency permit (also known as "[[Permanent residence (United States)|green card]]") application.

The [[United States Department of State]] publishes a monthly [[Visa Bulletin]] [https://web.archive.org/web/20140101101608/http://travel.state.gov/visa/bulletin/bulletin_1360.html] which lists cut-off dates for different immigration categories and countries of birth.  Only those intending applicants with priority dates before the cut-off date are permitted to file their [[Adjustment of status|Adjustment of Status]] (AOS) applications or attend immigrant visa interviews at consulates.  The cut-off dates generally move forward over time as old cases are approved or abandoned.  However, in certain cases, such as if a large number of old cases work their way through the system at about the same time, the cut-off dates can actually ''retrogress'' (or roll back).  If an individual already has a pending AOS application on file when a retrogression occurs that places the cut-off earlier than the applicant's priority date, USCIS sets the application aside and will not adjudicate it until the priority date is current again. As an example, after months of stagnation, in June 2007 the priority date cut-offs for employment-based second and third-preference (EB2 and EB3) applicants (the bulk of employment-based green card applicants) advanced dramatically for all countries of birth. On the low end, the cut-off advanced eight months for immigrants from mainland China for EB2 category.  EB3 for India-born applicants has moved forward 25 months, the most of any category, thus impacting a huge number of workers with jobs requiring bachelor's degrees.

For individuals starting the employment-based green card process now, [[Foreign State of Chargeability|country of chargeability]] and job requirements are paramount in determining how long the overall process will take. Individuals from countries of chargeability other than China or India with jobs requiring a master's degree can complete the entire process, from labor certification to receiving the green card, within approximately 1-2 years from start to finish, if there is no backlog of visa availability, i.e., all priority dates are current.  Workers whose immigrant visas are chargeable to China or India with jobs requiring only a bachelor's degree can expect to wait several years after their employer files the labor certification and immigrant visa petition to become eligible to file the final application for the green card itself.

'''Rosika "Rózsa" Bédy-Schwimmer''' (best known as Rosika Schwimmer, September 11, 1877 – August 3, 1948) was a [[Hungary|Hungarian]]-born [[pacifist]], [[feminist]] and [[female suffrage|female suffragist]]. She was one of the first [[World Federalist Movement|world federalists]], and served as one of the world's first female ambassadors (from Hungary to Switzerland) in 1918.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Pastor, "The Diplomatic Fiasco of the Modern World's First Woman Ambassador, Roza Bedy-Schwimmer." ''East European Quarterly'', Vol. 8, No. 4, 1974: 273–282&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early years==
Rosika Schwimmer was born to a [[Jew]]ish family in [[Budapest]] in [[Austria-Hungary]]. She studied music and languages but when family finances deteriorated in 1896, she began to work as a [[bookkeeper]].

==Political career==
In 1897 she organized the Association of Hungarian Women Clerks&lt;ref name="Wenger"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Wenger|first1=Beth|title=Rosika Schwimmer (1877 – 1948)|url=https://jwa.org/encyclopedia/article/schwimmer-rosika|website=Jewish Women's Archive|publisher=Jewish Women: A Comprehensive Historical Encyclopedia|accessdate=20 April 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160613023711/https://jwa.org/encyclopedia/article/schwimmer-rosika|archivedate=13 June 2016|location=Brookline, Massachusetts|date=20 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1904, Schwimmer founded the Hungarian [[Feminist Association]] ({{lang-hu|Feministák Egyesülete (FE)}}), along with other prominent feminists like [[Eugénia Miskolczy Meller]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Papp|first1=Claudia|last2=Zimmermann|first2=Susan|editor1-last=de Haan|editor1-first=Francisca|editor2-last=Daskalova|editor2-first=Krassimira|editor3-last=Loutfi|editor3-first=Anna|title=Biographical dictionary of women's movements and feminisms in Central, Eastern, and South Eastern Europe: 19th and 20th centuries|date=2006|publisher=Central European University Press|location=Budapest, Hungary|isbn=978-963-7326-39-4|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/chapter/766157|chapter=Meller, Mrs Artur, Eugénia Miskolczy (1872–1944)|pages=331–335|subscription=yes|via=[[Project MUSE]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; She helped to found [[Hungarian National Council of Women]], and was a board member in the [[Hungarian Peace Society]]. In 1909, the Minister of the Interior appointed her to the governing board of child welfare.&lt;ref name="Wenger" /&gt;

In 1913, she became a corresponding secretary of the [[International Woman Suffrage Alliance]] (IWSA). Schwimmer toured Europe with [[Carrie Chapman Catt]] to lecture on female suffrage. She also edited the magazine ''A nő'' (''The Woman'').&lt;ref&gt;http://www.yivoencyclopedia.org/article.aspx/Schwimmer_Rozsika&lt;/ref&gt; In 1914 Schwimmer moved to [[London]] and worked as a correspondent of various European newspapers and press secretary for IWSA.&lt;ref&gt;Gerit von Leitner.

Berlin: Weidler, 1998, {{ISBN|3-89693-125-3}}, p. 99.&lt;/ref&gt; When [[World War I]] broke out, she could not return  home and began to agitate for the end of hostilities. In 1914, she toured the [[US]] to demand President [[Woodrow Wilson]] form a neutral conference to end the war. In 1915 she took part in the formation of the [[Woman's Peace Party]].

[[:en:Louisa Keilhau|Louise Keilhau]] - Norway]]
At the [[Women at the Hague|International Congress of Women]], 28 April - 10 May 1915, [[The Hague]], [[Netherlands]] Schwimmer's proposal for a Neutral Conference for Continuous Mediation between the governments of the belligerents was adopted. Later that year, she gained the support of [[Henry Ford]], who chartered a [[Peace Ship]] to [[Stockholm]]. Disappointed with Ford's efforts, she later organized the International Committee for Immediate Mediation in June 1916. After the armistice, Schwimmer became vice-president of the [[Women's International League for Peace and Freedom]].

When Hungary gained independence from Austria-Hungary in 1918, prime minister [[Mihály Károlyi]] appointed Schwimmer to be ambassador to [[Switzerland]].&lt;ref&gt;Tibor Grant, "Against All Odds: Vira B. Whitehouse and Rosika Schwimmer in Switzherland, 1918." ''American Studies International'', Vol. 40, No. 1, 2002: 34–51&lt;/ref&gt; When the [[communism|communists]] gained control of the government in 1919, she opposed them and lost her civil rights. In 1920, when [[Miklós Horthy]]'s government ousted the communists, she fled to [[Vienna]] and in 1921 to the USA. She settled in Chicago and did not move back to Hungary, where she had contributed to building the foundation for future [[women in Hungarian politics]].

Her pacifist beliefs got Schwimmer labeled as a socialist in the US. She spent most of her remaining life fighting slander against her person. When [[Fred Marvin]] accused her of being a German spy and a [[Bolshevism|Bolshevist]] agent, she sued and received $17,000 in damages. However, she could not gain US citizenship because of her pacifism; the [[US Supreme Court]] ruled against her in ''[[United States v. Schwimmer]]'' (1929). In 1946, ''United States v. Schwimmer'' was overturned in ''[[Girouard v. United States]].'' She spent the rest of her life in the country as a [[stateless person]].

Later in life, Schwimmer tried to create a [[world government]]. In 1935, she formed the [[World Centre for Women's Archives]] with [[Mary Ritter Beard]]. She received the [[World Peace Prize]] in 1937. At the same year she formed the [[Campaign for World Government]] with [[Lola Maverick Lloyd]], the first [[World Federalist Movement|World Federalist]] organization of the 20th century. Later in the 20th century, the federalist movement have successfully led the campaign and coalition for creating an [[International Criminal Court]],&lt;ref&gt;http://www.iccnow.org/documents/WFM-IGP_2009_Annual_Report.pdf, page 6&lt;/ref&gt; which Schwimmer rarely gets credit for.&lt;ref name="NYPL"&gt;{{cite book|last=Ruttum|first=Laura|title=Lola Maverick Lloyd Papers: 1856–1949|url=http://www.nypl.org/sites/default/files/archivalcollections/pdf/lloydlola.pdf|publisher=[[New York Public Library]]|date=October 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1947 she was nominated for [[Nobel Peace Prize]] but had no chance of obtaining it as the prize was not awarded the next year.

==Death and legacy==
Rosika Schwimmer died of [[pneumonia]] on August 3, 1948 in [[New York City]].

'''Semantic Copyright''' is a technological system that provides semantic information of intellectual property rights of works in digital format, which identifies by its own morphology. The project began in May 2009 after its presentation at the [http://semanticcopyright.org/program.html Role of Copyright Registries en Global Digital Networks] and its first version was published and released their rights of use and deployment in March 2011. Its development has been developed by the Copyright Registry [[Safe Creative]], the Artificial Intelligence Department of the [[Technical University of Madrid]] and Dialnet, supported by Ministry of Industry, Tourism and Trade of Spain .

==Framework==
[[File:Semantic copyright marco.jpg|400px|thumb|Subsistemas del marco tecnológico Semantic Copyright]]
Provides a framework based on semantic information, which enables systems to conduct automated telematics intellectual property rights of the files transmitted with content such as text, images, music, video, computer programs, etc. The three subsystems that make up the technological framework that includes Semantic Copyright are:

#Identification of the work. The external system questioned by any node attached to Semantic Copyright over the copyright of a work. The identification was based on analysis of morphology own digital file containing the work, and it is not necessary that it include metadata or tagging SYSTEMS. Version 1.0 uses to recognize morphological fingerprint files: MD5, MD4 family and Secure Hash Algorithm .
#Consultation. The external system can direct the query to any node that uses the Semantic Model Copyright.
#Response. The answer semantics on intellectual property rights consists of two components:
##Short answer to the fundamental information of the rights of the work: Author's name and basic features of permits or restrictions on use and dissemination of the work. This information allows the system to devise automated decisions on the distribution or not the same.
##Web address included in the detailed semantic information to a specific ontology for the domain of the type of work (literary, art, music, video, etc.).

'''Serbian nationality law''' is based primarily on the principle of [[Jus sanguinis]]. Article 23 of the law stipulates that any foreign national with Serbian descent has the right to acquire Serbian citizenship by written request. The law also allows [[Multiple citizenship|dual citizenship]], allowing an individual the right to retain his or her current citizenship and receive Serbian citizenship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mfa.gov.rs/en/consular-affairs/citizenship|title=Citizenship|website=www.mfa.gov.rs}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bgcentar.org.rs/index.php?option=com_phocadownload&amp;view=category&amp;id=1:usvojeni-zakoni&amp;download=213:zakon-o-drzavljanstvu-republike-srbije&amp;start=40&amp;Itemid=54|title=Zakon o državljanstvu Republike Srbije|language=Serbian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2007 amendments enabled ethnic [[Serbs]] residing outside Serbia the right to citizenship. These amendments, adopted after the [[Montenegrin independence referendum, 2006]], also allowed citizens of [[Montenegro]] living in Serbia the right to gain citizenship, if they submit the request within a 5-year period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mzd.gov.rs/lat/download/dokumenti/zakonodrzavljanstvu.pdf|title=Izmene zakona o državljanstvu|language=Serbian|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111007143335/http://www.mzd.gov.rs/lat/download/dokumenti/zakonodrzavljanstvu.pdf|archivedate=2011-10-07|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Acquisition of citizenship==
* Acquiring citizenship by descent
* Acquiring citizenship by birth in the territory of Serbia
* Acquiring citizenship by admission (naturalization)

==Termination of citizenship==
* Termination of citizenship by release
* Termination of citizenship by renunciation

{{main|Visa requirements for Serbian citizens}}

In 2015, Serbian citizens had visa-free or visa on arrival access to 110 countries and territories, ranking the [[Serbian passport]] 43rd in the world according to the [[Visa_(document)#Visa_Restrictions_Index|Visa Restrictions Index]].

The Serbian passport is one of the 5 passports with the most improved rating globally since 2006 in terms of the number of countries that its holders may visit without a visa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/the-henley--partners-visa-restrictions-index-celebrates-ten-years-530277751.html|title=The Henley &amp; Partners Visa Restrictions Index Celebrates Ten Years|first=Henley &amp;|last=Partners|website=www.prnewswire.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Spokeo, Inc. v. Robins''''', 578 U.S. ___ (2016), was a [[Supreme Court of the United States|United States Supreme Court]] case in which the Court vacated and [[remand (court procedure)|remanded]] a ruling by [[United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit]] on the basis that the Ninth Circuit had not properly determined whether the plaintiff has suffered an "injury-in-fact" when analyzing whether he had [[Standing (law)|standing]] to bring his case in [[Federal judiciary of the United States|federal court]].&lt;ref&gt;''Spokeo, Inc. v. Robins'', No. 13–1339, 578 U.S. ___, slip op. at 8-11 (2016).&lt;/ref&gt; The Court did not discuss whether "the Ninth Circuit’s ultimate conclusion — that Robins adequately alleged an injury in fact — was correct."&lt;ref&gt;''Spokeo'', slip op. at 11.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
[[Spokeo]], Inc. operates a [[.com]] website featuring a "people [[web search engine|search engine]]" with which its users can obtain in-depth consumer reports on individual persons.&lt;ref name=harv1&gt;{{Bluebook journal |first=|last=Note| title=The Supreme Court, 2015 Term — Leading Cases | volume=130 | journal=[[Harvard Law Review|Harv.

Wright II]] dismissed the initial [[complaint]] for not alleging "any actual or imminent harm" after which Robins amended his complaint to allege employment, stress and anxiety injuries.&lt;ref name=harv1/&gt;{{rp|438}}  In May 2011, Judge Wright found Robins had alleged a valid injury-in-fact before then reversing himself and dismissing the case for lack of [[standing (law)|standing]] after Spokeo filed for an [[appeal]].&lt;ref name=harv1/&gt;{{rp|438}}

In June 2012, Spokeo agreed to pay $800,000 to settle a separate FCRA based lawsuit filed by the [[Federal Trade Commission]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Wyatt|first1=Edward|title=Spokeo Is Penalized by F.T.C. in Sale of Personal Data|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/13/technology/ftc-levies-first-fine-over-internet-data.html|accessdate=12 February 2018|work=The New York Times|date=13 June 2012|page=B2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Spokeo to Pay $800,000 to Settle FTC Charges Company Allegedly Marketed Information to Employers and Recruiters in Violation of FCRA|url=https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/press-releases/2012/06/spokeo-pay-800000-settle-ftc-charges-company-allegedly-marketed|accessdate=12 February 2018|work=[[Federal Trade Commission]]|date=12 June 2012|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2014, a unanimous panel of the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit]] reversed Judge Wright's dismissal and remanded the case.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court |litigants=Robins v. Spokeo, Inc. |vol=742 |reporter=F.3d |opinion= 409|pinpoint= |court=9th Cir. |date=2014 |url=https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=15051650234664622607|accessdate= |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Judge [[Diarmuid O'Scannlain]], joined by Judges [[Susan P. Graber]] and [[Carlos Bea]], reasoned that Robins had alleged injuries sufficient to establish standing because FCRA protected individual, rather than collective, rights and Robins was suing for a violation of his own statutory rights.&lt;ref name=harv1/&gt;{{rp|438}}  In a footnote, the Circuit explicitly found it did not need to reach Robins' additional allegations regarding injuries to his employment prospects or from anxiety.&lt;ref name=harv1/&gt;{{rp|439}}

The [[Supreme Court of the United States]] granted Spokeo's petition for a writ of [[certiorari]] and one-hour of [[oral argument]]s were heard on November 2, 2015, where Deputy [[Solicitor General of the United States|U.S. Solicitor General]] Malcom Stewart appeared for the government as a friend in support of Robins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Liptak|first1=Adam|authorlink=Adam Liptak|title=Justices Hear Debate on Suing Companies for Seemingly Harmless Falsehoods|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/03/business/justices-hear-debate-on-suing-companies-for-seemingly-harmless-falsehoods.html|accessdate=12 February 2018|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=3 November 2015|page=B3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=The Editorial Board|title=Opinion: Justices Should Let an Online Privacy Case Proceed|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/01/opinion/sunday/justices-should-let-a-online-privacy-case-proceed.html|accessdate=12 February 2018|work=The New York Times|date=1 November 2015|page=SR10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Spokeo, Inc. v.

==Opinion of the Court==
On May 16, 2016, the Supreme Court delivered judgment in favor of Spokeo, [[vacated judgment|vacating]] and [[remand (court procedure)|remanding]] by a vote of 6-2.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Liptak|first1=Adam|title=Supreme Court Returns False-Data Case to Appeals Panel|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/17/business/supreme-court-returns-false-data-case-to-appeals-panel.html|accessdate=12 February 2018|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=17 May 2016|page=B3}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Justice [[Samuel Alito]], joined by Chief Justice [[John Roberts]], as well as Justices [[Anthony Kennedy]], [[Clarence Thomas]], [[Stephen Breyer]], and [[Elena Kagan]], wrote that the circuit below had failed to establish that Robins had [[standing (law)|standing]] to file the lawsuit under [[Article Three of the United States Constitution]].&lt;ref name=harv1/&gt;{{rp|439}}

The Court first explained that the Constitution's [[Case or Controversy Clause]] requires any plaintiff to allege an injury-in-fact that is "concrete and particularized".&lt;ref name=harv1/&gt;{{rp|439}}  While the Ninth Circuit identified particular harms to Robins, it erred, according to the Court, by not also determining that those harms were "concrete".&lt;ref name=harv1/&gt;{{rp|439}}  Although intangible harms such as [[risk]] can be concrete, the Court clarified, "bare procedural violations" cannot.&lt;ref name=harv1/&gt;{{rp|439}}  The Court remanded the case while taking "no position as to whether the Ninth Circuit’s ultimate conclusion— that Robins adequately alleged an injury in fact— was correct."&lt;ref&gt;''Spokeo, Inc. v. Robins'', 136 S. Ct. 1540, 1550 (2015).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Justice Thomas' concurrence===
Justice [[Clarence Thomas]] added a concurrence, alone.&lt;ref name=harv1/&gt;{{rp|440}}  He wrote separately to describe his belief that the Constitution's Case or Controversy requirement is founded upon the [[common law]] distinction between [[private rights]] and [[public rights]] as articulated by [[William Blackstone]].&lt;ref&gt;''Spokeo, Inc. v. Robins'', 136 S. Ct. 1540, 1551 (2015) (Thomas, J., concurring), citing [http://www.law.virginia.edu/pdf/faculty/hein/woolhandler/102mich_l_rev689_2004.pdf Woolhander &amp; Nelson, ''Does History Defeat Standing Doctrine?''], 102 Mich. L. Rev. 689, 693 (2004).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Justice Ginsburg's dissent===
Justice [[Ruth Bader Ginsburg]], joined by [[Sonia Sotomayor]], dissented.&lt;ref name=harv1/&gt;{{rp|441}}  Justice Ginsburg wrote that she agreed with much of the Court’s opinion but saw "no utility" in remanding the case back to the Ninth Circuit.  Justice Ginsburg saw the many inaccuracies published by Spokeo as concretely harming Robins and, as such, she would have simply affirmed.&lt;ref name=harv1/&gt;{{rp|441}}

==Subsequent developments==
On August 15, 2017, the Ninth Circuit again allowed Robins' lawsuit to proceed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court |litigants=Robins v. Spokeo, Inc. |vol=867 |reporter=F.3d |opinion= 1108|pinpoint= |court=9th Cir. |date=2017 |url=https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=17482366739814356077|accessdate= |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=harv2&gt;{{Bluebook journal |first=|last=Note| title=Recent Case: Ninth Circuit Allows Fair Credit Reporting Act Class Action to Proceed Past Standing Challenge| volume=131 | journal=Harv.

Relying on an ''[[amicus curiae]]'' brief filed by the [[Consumer Financial Protection Bureau]] in support of Robins, Judge O'Scannlain determined that publishing even flattering inaccuracies could harm a job seeker.

In the United States, '''Tax Day''' is a colloquial term for the day on which individual income [[Tax return (United States)|tax returns]] are due to be submitted to the [[Federal government of the United States|federal government]].&lt;ref name="loc"&gt;{{cite web|title=History of the US Income Tax|url=https://www.loc.gov/rr/business/hottopic/irs_history.html|publisher= Library of Congress|accessdate=December 29, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The term may also refer to the same day for individual states, even where the tax return due date is a different day.

Since 1955, for those living in the United States, Tax Day has typically fallen on April 15.&lt;ref name="loc" /&gt; For people who file a U.S. tax return and live outside the United States and [[Puerto Rico]], Tax Day has typically fallen on June 15, because of the two-month automatic extension granted to filers by [[IRS]] Publication 54.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report |url= https://www.irs.gov/publications/p54/ch01.html |title= Tax Guide for U.S. Citizens and Residents Abroad |publisher= Internal Revenue Service |id= Publication 54 |year= 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Emancipation Day#District of Columbia|Emancipation Day]], a holiday in Washington, D.C. commemorating the emancipation in April 1862 of [[District of Columbia Compensated Emancipation Act|enslaved people of African descent]] and which is observed on the weekday closest to April 16, causes special rules to apply: when April 15 falls on a Friday, tax returns are due the following Monday; when April 15 falls on a Saturday or Sunday, tax returns are due the following Tuesday.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Internal Revenue Bulletin:  2011-10|url=https://www.irs.gov/irb/2011-10_IRB#NOT-2011-17|publisher=Internal Revenue Service|accessdate=December 29, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Roos|first=Dave|title=Why do Americans pay taxes on April 15?|url=http://money.howstuffworks.com/personal-finance/personal-income-taxes/april-15-tax-day1.htm|work=How Stuff Works|accessdate=December 29, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Federal income tax was introduced with the [[Revenue Act of 1861]] to help fund the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], and subsequently repealed, re-adopted, and held unconstitutional. The early taxes were based on assessments, not voluntary tax returns. Tax payment dates varied by act.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, [[Revenue Act of 1861]], section 50, [[Revenue Act of 1862]] section 91.&lt;/ref&gt;

The case of ''[[Pollock v. Farmers' Loan &amp; Trust Co.]]'' challenged the constitutionality of the [[Wilson–Gorman Tariff Act]] of 1894, which taxed incomes over $4,000 at the rate of two percent. The case was decided by the [[United States Supreme Court]] in 1895. The Supreme Court decided that the Act's unapportioned income taxes on interest, dividends, and rents were effectively [[direct taxes]]. The Act was therefore unconstitutional because it violated the [[United States Constitution|Constitution]]'s rule that direct taxes be [[Apportionment (politics)|apportioned]] among the states.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Constitution, Article I, Section 9.&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1913, eighteen years later, the [[Sixteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution]] was ratified. This Amendment gave the [[United States Congress]] the legal authority to tax all incomes without regard to the apportionment requirement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://constitutioncenter.org/interactive-constitution/amendments/amendment-xvi|title=Common Interpretation: The Sixteenth Amendment|publisher=National Constitution Center|accessdate=April 17, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The filing deadline for individuals was March 1 in 1913 (the first year of a federal income tax), and was changed to March 15 in 1918 and again to April 15 in 1955.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://money.cnn.com/magazines/fortune/fortune_archive/2002/04/15/321414/index.htm|title=Why Is Tax Day April 15?|work=Fortune|date=April 15, 2002|accessdate=March 11, 2010 | first=Jessica | last=Sung}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today, the filing deadline for U.S. federal income tax returns for individuals remains April 15 or, in the event that the 15th falls on a Saturday, Sunday or holiday, the first succeeding day that is not a Saturday, Sunday or holiday.{{Citation needed|reason=Inconsistent with earlier in the page, where the article says Tax Day falls on the following Tuesday, not Monday.|date=April 2017}}{{Inconsistent|date=April 2017}}

==Alignment with state and District of Columbia holidays==

Tax Day occasionally falls on [[Patriots' Day]], a civic holiday in the Commonwealth of [[Massachusetts]] and state of [[Maine]], or the preceding weekend. When this occurred for some time, the federal tax deadline was extended by a day for the residents of Maine, [[Maryland]], Massachusetts, [[New Hampshire]], [[New York (state)|New York]], [[Vermont]], and the [[District of Columbia]], because the [[Internal Revenue Service|IRS]] processing center for these areas was located in [[Andover, Massachusetts#Points of interest|Andover, Massachusetts]] and the unionized IRS employees got the day off.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.irs.gov/uac/Patriot's-Day-2007-Gives-Some-Taxpayers-Extra-Tax-Time|title=Patriot's Day 2007 Gives Some Taxpayers Extra Tax Time, IR-2006-170|publisher=Internal Revenue Service|date=November 8, 2006|accessdate=March 27, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, the Monday, April 18, Tax Day fell on Patriots' Day. However, federal filings were directed to [[Hartford, Connecticut]], [[Charlotte, North Carolina]] and  [[Kansas City, Missouri]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.irs.gov/uac/MASSACHUSETTS---Where-to-File-Addresses-for-Taxpayers-and-Tax-Professionals|title=Massachusetts: Where to File Addresses for Individual Taxpayers|publisher=Internal Revenue Service|accessdate=March 27, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and there was no further extension for Maine, Massachusetts or other surrounding states' residents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.pressherald.com/news/whos-paying-taxes_-half-of-us_2011-04-18.html |at= Why is the deadline today?

[[Emancipation Day#District of Columbia|Emancipation Day]] is celebrated in [[Washington D.C.]] on the weekday nearest April 16, and under a federal statute enacted decades ago, holidays observed in the District of Columbia have an impact nationwide.  If April 15 falls on a Friday then Emancipation Day is celebrated on the same day and tax returns are instead due the following Monday, April 18.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ellis|first=Blake|title=Tax day extended to April 18|url=http://money.cnn.com/2011/01/04/pf/taxes/tax_deadline_extended/|publisher=CNN Money|accessdate=December 29, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2016 Tax Season Opens Jan. 19 for Nation’s Taxpayers |url=https://www.irs.gov/uac/Newsroom/2016-Tax-Season-Opens-Jan-19-for-Nations-Taxpayers |publisher=U.S. Internal Revenue Service |accessdate=April 7, 2016 |date=December 21, 2015|quote=The filing deadline to submit 2015 tax returns is Monday, April 18, 2016, rather than the traditional April 15 date.

In 1853-4, conflict between the growing jurisdiction of magistrates' courts and the historical duties of the University [[Proctor#Cambridge_University|Proctors]] was the trigger for a schism between the University and the Borough.  The University suggested that the dispute be referred to parliament and [[Sir John Patteson]] was appointed as arbitrator to consider their differences.  His 1855 report recommended that Proctors should not have to submit to the jurisdiction of magistrates, but called on the University to surrender its rights over trade and licensing. When his proposals were enacted as the Cambridge Award Act 1856, the office of Taxor was discontinued.&lt;ref name="Winstanley p132-138"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SWrUpR_wn2kC&amp;pg=PA132 |title=Early Victorian Cambridge |author= D.

'''''The Road Rights and Liabilities of Wheelmen''''' written by [[George B. Clementson]] at the height of the [[Bicycle craze#1890s|bicycle's golden age]], in 1895, was the first [[treatise]] on [[bicycle law]]. In the 1880s and 1890s, the prevailing legal issue [[cyclists]] (or wheelmen as they were then called) faced was the question of the right to the road. In a series of seminal right to the road cases, cyclists gained legal rights that form the basis of cyclist's legal rights today. Although bicycle law has developed substantially since 1895, ''The Road Rights and Liabilities of Wheelmen'' continues to serve as an outstanding resource for those early right to the road cases.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6946">{{About|the labor philosophy|the book by Lipset, Trow, and Coleman|Union Democracy}}

'''Union democracy''' is a term referring to the governance of [[trade unions]], in terms of the quality of election procedures at ensuring the executives of a union most accurately represent the interests of the members.

==Theory==
In 1911, a German sociologist, [[Robert Michels]] propounded a view that all democratic organisations were prone to become oligarchies because of the growth and size of modern organisations, the need for specialisation of officials, and the necessity that this [[division of labour]] would lead the rank and file to struggle to understand the activities of their leaders. Michels argued that this amounted to an [[iron law of oligarchy]]: all groups, regardless of how [[democracy|democratic]] they may be at the start, eventually and inevitably develop into [[oligarchy|oligarchies]] with swollen [[bureaucracy|bureaucracies]]. Michels himself, after falling out with the German Social Democrat Party, migrated to Italy and joined Mussolini's Fascist Party. Nevertheless, his ideas were popularized after the [[Second World War]] in particular by [[Seymour Martin Lipset]], Trow, and [[James Samuel Coleman]] in a book entitled, ''[[Union Democracy: The Internal Politics of the International Typographical Union]]'' (1957). This book argued that the [[International Typographical Union|ITU]] was an exception to Michels' general law, and that the conditions necessary to ensure democracy were that an opposition to the union's leadership could form. This depended on ensuring the leadership did not monopolize the channels of communication with members. Lipset and his coauthors confined their understanding of "democracy" to the existence of organised opposition. They were skeptical that the conditions in the ITU, which made it democratic, were likely to arise in many other unions spontaneously. Following this, in 1959, the US Federal government passed the [[Landrum-Griffin Act 1959]] to mandate democratic principles be followed in union governance.

==Law==
*[[International Labour Organization]], [[Freedom of Association Convention]] (1948) No 87
*US [[Labor Management Reporting and Disclosure Act 1959]]
*UK [[Trade Union Act 1984]], now in the [[Trade Union and Labour Relations (Consolidation) Act 1992]] s 72

==Principles==
Principles include:
*Frequent, contested elections, with rank-and-file members regularly challenging incumbents, and resultant turnover in officers and representatives, with all candidates having equal access to membership lists before elections, including the right to copy the list.
*Open publications, with newsletters and websites publishing all members' views, including those critical of officials, representatives, or union policy, and the union encouraging open and free debate and discussion of issues and candidates; with election candidates having equal use of union publications and means of communication (website, newsletter, e-mail list) to put out their campaign material.
*Member ratification, with all [[contracts]] and "side agreements" between union and management subject to ratification by secret ballot by the members covered by the contract.
*[[Strike action|Strike]] votes: members should vote on striking, on return to work, and on other decisions during strikes, with strike votes not used to force members to ratify contracts ("either you vote 'yes' or you vote to strike").
*"Informed vote": the complete text of proposed contract changes, amendments, referendums, etc. should be distributed to members prior to ratification votes, with sufficient time for meaningful membership review and discussion, and the union circulating (or at least not obstructing) different opinions about the contract offer.
*Election of representatives: [[shop steward]]s, business agents and other member representatives (paid or otherwise) should be elected by secret ballot of the members they represent, and subject to [[recall election|recall]] by the members they represent; stewards and active members should be trained in [[labour rights|legal rights]] and [[organizing (management)|organizing]]; and there should be  stewards' councils that meet to plan and coordinate action.
*[[grievance|Grievants']] rights: workers should participate fully in the grievance process at every step, with full information about their case and its progress.
*Member access to information: union representatives should provide members current and complete copies of the contract and the union constitution/bylaws, and the contract and constitution should be published on union websites. Members must have easy access to information on officers' salaries, budget, and expenses. Union representatives should regularly inform members of their rights under national and local law, and how to enforce them, including rights and responsibilities under the relevant regulations.
*Regular [[Local union|local]] meetings, to be at least quarterly, announced ahead of time, at a time and place convenient to members, with an agenda circulated in advance, under reasonable [[quorum]] requirements not set so high as to prevent valid membership meetings. Real business should be conducted (not just a pep rally), with members encouraged to speak, make proposals, vote, and ask questions, and meeting minutes available to all members afterwards.
*Independent organizing and communication outside union official structure: members should have the right to organize in independent committees and caucuses, publish rank-and-file newsletters and websites, and run candidates for union office, and union officers should encourage this.
*Inclusion and equality: all members should be treated fairly, with the union fighting discrimination by management and among members. Union officers and representatives should reflect membership in terms of gender, race, language, [[craft]] or [[bargaining unit]], [[seniority]], etc. Union contracts, constitution and bylaws, meetings, and publications should be accessible in the languages spoken by members.
*Education for members: unions should train all interested members in legal rights and organizing, including how to participate effectively in the union and how to organize on the job.

While there are some superficial similarities to the so-called [[organizing model]] of union activity, advocates of union democracy are swift to point out that many of the alleged exemplars of the organizing model do not, in their internal structure, meet the requirements listed above.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="21953">The [[United States]] was among the nations that participated in the third [[United Nations]] Conference on the Law of the Sea, which took place from 1973 through 1982 and resulted in the international treaty known as the [[United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea]] (UNCLOS). The United States also participated in the subsequent negotiations of modifications to the treaty from 1990 to 1994. The UNCLOS came into force in 1994. Although the United States now recognizes the UNCLOS as a codification of [[customary international law]], it has not [[ratification|ratified]] it.

UNCLOS, also called the Law of the Sea Convention or the Law of the Sea Treaty, defines the rights and responsibilities of nations in their use of the world's oceans; it establishes guidelines for businesses, the environment, and the management of marine [[natural resource]]s. To date, 162 countries and the European Union have joined the Convention.

==History==

===UNCLOS III===
The Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS III) was convened in late 1973 in [[New York (state)|New York]]. The most significant issues which were covered were setting limits, navigation, archipelagic status and transit regimes, [[exclusive economic zones]] (EEZs), continental shelf jurisdiction, deep seabed mining, the exploitation regime, protection of the marine environment, scientific research, and settlement of [[maritime boundary]] disputes. With more than 160 nations participating, the Conference continued until its final meeting in late 1982, at which time the final act was signed and the Convention was opened for signature. As time went on, it became clear that the United States, among other developed states, was not willing to agree to Part XI of the Convention concerning deep seabed portions and mining of potentially valuable metals.&lt;ref name=rufe&gt;Roger Rufe, President of the Ocean Conservancy. [http://foreign.senate.gov/testimony/2003/RufeTestimony031021.pdf Statement before the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations, October 21, 2003].&lt;/ref&gt;

The United States objected to Part XI of the Convention on several grounds, arguing that the treaty was unfavorable to American economic and security interests. The U.S. claimed that the provisions of the treaty were not free-market friendly and were designed to favor the economic systems of the [[Communist state]]s. The U.S. also argued that the [[International Seabed Authority]] established by the Convention might become a bloated and expensive bureaucracy, due to a combination of large revenues and insufficient control over what the revenues could be used for.

The United States accepted all but Part XI as customary international law. In March 1983 President [[Ronald Reagan]], through [[Presidential proclamation|Proclamation]] No. 5030, claimed a 200-mile exclusive economic zone. In December 1988 President Reagan, through Proclamation No. 5928, extended U.S. territorial waters from three nautical miles to twelve nautical miles for national security purposes. However a legal opinion from the [[United States Department of Justice|Justice Department]] questioned the President's constitutional authority to extend sovereignty as Congress has the power to make laws concerning the territory belonging to the United States under the U.S. Constitution. In any event, Congress needs to pass laws defining if the extended waters, including oil and mineral rights, are under State or Federal control.&lt;ref name=nyt-19881229&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1988/12/29/us/reagan-extends-territorial-waters-to-12-miles.html |title=Reagan Extends Territorial Waters to 12 Miles |author=Andrew Rosenthal |newspaper=New York Times |date=29 December 1988 |accessdate=23 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://ir.lawnet.fordham.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1362&amp;context=ilj |title=U.S. Territorial Sea Extension: Jurisdiction and International Environmental Protection |author=Carol Elizabeth Remy |journal=Fordham International Law Journal |year=1992 |volume=16 |issue=4 |pages=1208-1252 |accessdate=23 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Revision of the UNCLOS===
From 1983 to 1990, the United States attempted to establish an alternative regime for exploitation of the minerals of the deep seabed. An agreement was made with other seabed mining nations and licenses were granted to four international consortia. Concurrently, the Preparatory Commission was established to prepare for the eventual coming into force of the Convention-recognized claims by applicants, sponsored by signatories of the Convention. Overlaps between the two groups were resolved, but a decline in the demand for minerals from the seabed made the seabed regime significantly less relevant. In addition, the decline of Socialism and the fall of Communism in the late 1980s had removed much of the support for some of the more contentious Part XI provisions.

In 1990, consultations were begun between signatories and non-signatories (including the United States) over the possibility of modifying the Convention to allow the industrialized countries to join the Convention. The resulting 1994 Agreement on Implementation was adopted as a binding international Convention. It mandated that key articles, including those on limitation of seabed production and mandatory technology transfer, would not be applied, that the United States, if it became a member, would be guaranteed a seat on the Council of the International Seabed Authority, and finally, that voting would be done in groups, with each group able to block decisions on substantive matters. The 1994 Agreement also established a Finance Committee that would originate the financial decisions of the Authority, to which the largest donors would automatically be members and in which decisions would be made by consensus.

Thus, modifications to that provision were negotiated, and an amending agreement was finalized in July 1994. The U.S. signed the Agreement in 1994 and now recognizes the Convention as general international law, but has not ratified it at this time. UNCLOS entered into force in November 1994 with the requisite sixty ratifications.&lt;ref name=rufe /&gt;

===Latest developments===
On April 24, 2004 [[Jeane Kirkpatrick]] (Reagan Administration United Nations Ambassador 1981–1985), testified against United States ratification of the treaty before the Senate Armed Services Committee, in which she argued that "Viewed from the perspective of U.S. interests and Reagan Administration principles, it was a bad bargain," and that "its ratification will diminish our capacity for self-government, including, ultimately, our capacity for self-defense."&lt;ref&gt;Jeane J. Kirkpatrick. [http://armed-services.senate.gov/statemnt/2004/April/Kirkpatrick.pdf Testimony before the Senate Armed Services Committee]. April 8, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 11, 2006, the 5-Member UNCLOS Annex VII Arbitral Tribunal, presided over by H.E. Judge [[Stephen M. Schwebel]], rendered after two years of international judicial proceedings, the landmark Barbados/Trinidad and Tobago Award, which resolved the maritime [[boundary delimitation]] (in the East, Central and West sectors) to satisfaction of both Parties and committed [[Barbados]] and [[Trinidad and Tobago]] to resolve their fisheries dispute by means of concluding a new Fisheries Agreement.

On May 15, 2007, U.S. President George W. Bush announced that he had urged the Senate to approve UNCLOS.&lt;ref&gt;[https://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2007/05/20070515-2.html President's Statement on Advancing U.S. Interests in the World's Oceans]. Office of the Press Secretary. May 15, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 20, 2007, an Arbitral Tribunal constituted under UNCLOS issued its decision on a longstanding maritime boundary dispute between [[Guyana]] and [[Suriname]], which contained a ruling blaming both nations for violating treaty obligations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pca-cpa.org/showpage.asp?pag_id=1147 "Guyana/Suriname."] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130208082359/http://www.pca-cpa.org/showpage.asp?pag_id=1147 |date=February 8, 2013 }} Permanent Court of Arbitration. September 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 31, 2007, the [[Senate Foreign Relations Committee]] voted 17–4 to send the treaty to the full [[U.S. Senate]] for a vote.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/latestCrisis/idUSN31335584|publisher=Reuters|title=U.S. Senate panel backs Law of the Sea treaty|last=Drawbaugh|first=Kevin|date=October 31, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 13, 2009, speaking at her Senate confirmation hearing as nominee for U.S. secretary of state, [[Senator Hillary Clinton]] said that ratification of the Law of the Sea Treaty would be a priority for her.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cfr.org/publication/18225/transcript_of_hillary_clintons_confirmation_hearing.html Transcript of Hillary Clinton's Confirmation Hearing]. Council on Foreign Relations. January 13, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 23, 2012, [[Secretary of State Hillary Clinton]] testified before the [[U.S. Senate Committee on Foreign Relations]] and argued for the ratification of the treaty.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.state.gov/secretary/rm/2012/05/190685.htm] The Law of the Sea Convention (Treaty Doc. 103-39): The U.S. National Security and Strategic Imperatives for Ratification&lt;/ref&gt; During the same hearing, Secretary of Defense [[Leon Panetta]] and Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman General [[Martin Dempsey]] also urged swift ratification of the Law of the Sea Treaty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ratifythetreatynow.org/news/america%E2%80%99s-defense-chief-senior-military-advisor-and-top-diplomat-call-%E2%80%98law-sea%E2%80%99-ratification |title=America’s Defense Chief, Senior Military Advisor and Top Diplomat Call for ‘Law of the Sea’ Ratification |publisher=RatifyTheTreatyNow.Org |date=2012-05-23 |accessdate=2012-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 14, 2012, The [[U.S. Senate Committee on Foreign Relations]] held the so-called "24 Star" hearing, featuring six four-star generals and admirals representing every branch of the U.S. Armed Forces. Each witness, including the [[Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff]], [[Chief of Naval Operations]], [[Commandant of the Coast Guard]], Commander of U.S. Transportation Command, Commander of U.S. Northern Command, and Commander of the U.S. Pacific Command all testified in favor of ratifying the treaty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.foreign.senate.gov/press/chair/release/24-star-military-witnesses-voice-strong-support-for-law-of-the-sea-treaty |title="24 Star" Military Witnesses Voice Strong Support for Law of the Sea Treaty |publisher=Senate Committee on Foreign Relations press release |date=2012-06-14 |accessdate=2012-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, later, the same Committee heard from retired general and flag officers collectively having 33 stars and testifying unanimously against UNCLOS ratification.

On June 28, 2012, the [[U.S. Chamber of Commerce]], the [[American Petroleum Institute]] (API), the [[National Association of Manufacturers]] (NAM) and [[Verizon Communications]] testified before the [[U.S. Senate Committee on Foreign Relations]] that the Law of the Sea Treaty would strengthen the U.S. economy and help create American jobs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ratifythetreatynow.org/news/america%E2%80%99s-leading-business-voices-testify-%E2%80%98law-sea%E2%80%99-needed-us-economic-growth-job-creation |title=America’s Leading Business Voices Testify: ‘Law of Sea’ Needed for U.S. Economic Growth, Job Creation |publisher=RatifyTheTreatyNow.Org |date=2012-06-24 |accessdate=2012-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 16, 2012, 34 Republican Senators signed a letter to U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman [[John Kerry]] pledging to vote against the treaty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2012/jul/16/demint-says-law-sea-treaty-now-dead/?page=all |title=DeMint: Law of the Sea Treaty now dead |publisher=WashingtonTimes.Com |date=2012-07-16 |accessdate=2012-12-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because treaty ratification in the U.S. requires 2/3 of the [[United States Senate]] to vote for approval, the 34 signatories are enough to stop treaty ratificiation. However, Senator [[Lisa Murkowski]] later said that the vote to deny passage in 2012 was purely political and that the U.S. Chamber of Commerce would deliver enough Republican votes for passage in the lame duck session.&lt;ref&gt;Colman, Zack. [http://thehill.com/blogs/e2-wire/e2-wire/244101-murkowski-sea-treaty-might-pass-in-lame-duck "Republican senator says sea treaty might  pass after election."] ''The Hill'', 17 August 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Debate==
In the [[United States]] there has been vigorous debate over the ratification of the treaty, with criticism coming mainly from political [[American conservatism|conservatives]] who consider involvement in some international organizations and treaties as detrimental to U.S. national interests. A group of Republican senators led by [[Jim Inhofe]] of [[Oklahoma]] blocked American ratification of the Convention, claiming that it would impinge on U.S. [[sovereignty]]. Other commentators have argued that although the [[George W.

The '''University of Bonn''' ({{lang-de|Rheinische Friedrich-Wilhelms-Universität Bonn}}) is a [[public research university]] located in [[Bonn]], [[Germany]]. It was founded in its present form as the Rhein University on 18 October 1818 by [[Frederick William III]], as the linear successor of the Kurkölnische Akademie Bonn ({{lang-en|Academy of the Prince-elector of Cologne}}) which was founded in 1777. The University of Bonn offers a large number of undergraduate and graduate programs in a range of subjects and has 544 professors and 32,500 students. Its library holds more than five million volumes.

As of August 2018, among its notable alumni, faculty and researchers are [[List of Nobel laureates by university affiliation II|10 Nobel Laureates]], [[List of Fields Medal winners by university affiliation|4 Fields Medalists]], twelve [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz Prize]] winners, [[Albert, Prince Consort|Prince Albert]], [[Pope Benedict XVI]], [[Frederick III, German Emperor|Frederick III]], [[Karl Marx]], [[Heinrich Heine]], [[Friedrich Nietzsche]], [[Konrad Adenauer]], and [[Joseph Schumpeter]]{{Citation needed|date=July 2017}}.

==History==
===Foundation===
[[File:Universität Bonn.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|The Electoral Palace, the main building of the University of Bonn]]
The university's forerunner was the ''Kurkölnische Akademie Bonn'' (English: Academy of the [[Prince-elector]] of [[Cologne]]) which was founded in 1777 by [[Maximilian Frederick of Königsegg-Rothenfels]], the prince-elector of Cologne. In the spirit of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] the new academy was nonsectarian. The academy had schools for [[theology]], [[law]], [[pharmacy]] and general studies. In 1784 [[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Joseph II]] granted the academy the right to award academic degrees (''Licentiat'' and Ph.D.), turning the academy into a university. The academy was closed in 1798 after the left bank of the [[Rhine]] was occupied by France during the [[French Revolutionary Wars]].

The [[Rhineland]] became a part of [[Prussia]] in 1815 as a result of the [[Congress of Vienna]]. King [[Frederick William III of Prussia]] thereafter decreed the establishment of a new university in the new province (German: ''den aus Landesväterlicher Fürsorge für ihr Bestes gefaßten Entschluß, in Unsern Rheinlanden eine Universität zu errichten'') on 18 October 1818. At this time there was no university in the Rhineland, as all three universities that existed until the end of the 18th century were closed as a result of the French occupation. The Kurkölnische Akademie Bonn was one of these three universities. The other two were the Roman Catholic [[University of Cologne]] and the Protestant [[University of Duisburg]].

===Rhein University===
[[Image:FWIII.jpg|thumb|left|upright|The university founder [[Frederick William III of Prussia]].]]
The new Rhein University (German: ''Rhein-Universität'') was then founded on 18 October 1818 by Frederick William III. It was the sixth Prussian University, founded after the universities in [[University of Greifswald|Greifswald]], [[Humboldt University of Berlin|Berlin]], [[University of Königsberg|Königsberg]], [[Martin Luther University of Halle-Wittenberg|Halle]] and [[University of Wrocław|Breslau]]. The new university was equally shared between the two Christian denominations. This was one of the reasons why Bonn, with its tradition of a nonsectarian university, was chosen over Cologne and Duisburg. Apart from a school of Roman Catholic theology and a school of Protestant theology, the university had schools for medicine, law and philosophy. Initially 35 professors and eight adjunct professors were teaching in Bonn.

The university constitution was adopted in 1827. In the spirit of [[Wilhelm von Humboldt]] the constitution emphasized the autonomy of the university and the unity of teaching and research. Similar to the [[Humboldt University of Berlin|University of Berlin]], which was founded in 1810, the new constitution made the University of Bonn a [[History of European research universities#European university models in the 19th and 20th centuries|modern research university]].

Only one year after the inception of the Rhein University the [[dramatist]] [[August von Kotzebue]] was murdered by [[Karl Ludwig Sand]], a student at the [[Friedrich Schiller University of Jena|University of Jena]]. The [[Carlsbad Decrees]], introduced on 20 September 1819 led to a general crackdown on universities, the dissolution of the [[Burschenschaft]]en and the introduction of censorship laws. One victim was the author and poet [[Ernst Moritz Arndt]], who, freshly appointed university professor in Bonn, was banned from teaching. Only after the death of Frederick William III in 1840 was he reinstated in his professorship. Another consequence of the [[Carlsbad Decrees]] was the refusal by Frederick William III to confer the chain of office, the official seal and an official name to the new university. The Rhein University was thus nameless until 1840, when the new King of Prussia, [[Frederick William IV of Prussia|Frederick William IV]] gave it the official name Rheinische Friedrich-Wilhelms-Universität.  (This last sentence conflicts with pg. 176 of "Die Preussischen Universitäten", which states a cabinet order on 28 June 1828 gave the university the following name: Rheinische Friedrich-Wilhelms Universität.&lt;ref&gt;Johann Friedrich Wilhelm Koch: Die Preussischen Universitäten, vol. 1, Berlin: Posen und Bromberg: 1839, pg. 176.&lt;/ref&gt;)

[[Image:Frkekulé.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[Friedrich August Kekulé von Stradonitz]] was a professor of chemistry at the University of Bonn from 1867 to 1896.]]
Despite these problems, the university grew and attracted famous scholars and students. At the end of the 19th century the university was also known as the ''Prinzenuniversität'' (English:''Princes' university''), as many of the sons of the king of Prussia studied here. In 1900, the university had 68 chairs, 23 adjunct chairs, two honorary professors, 57 [[Privatdozent]]en and six lecturers. Since 1896, women were allowed to attend classes as guest auditors at universities in Prussia. In 1908 the University of Bonn became fully coeducational.

===World Wars===
The growth of the university came to a halt with [[World War I]]. Financial and economic problems in Germany in the aftermath of the war resulted in reduced government funding for the university. The University of Bonn responded by trying to find private and industrial sponsors. In 1930 the university adopted a new constitution. For the first time students were allowed to participate in the self-governing university administration. To that effect the [[Students' union|student council]] Astag (German: ''Allgemeine Studentische Arbeitsgemeinschaft'') was founded in the same year. Members of the student council were elected in a secret ballot.

After the Nazi takeover of power in 1933, the [[Gleichschaltung]] transformed the university into a Nazi educational institution. According to the [[Führerprinzip]] the autonomous and self-governening administration of the university was replaced by a hierarchy of leaders resembling the military, with the university president being subordinate to the ministry of education. Jewish professors and students and political opponents were ostracized and expelled from the university. The theologian [[Karl Barth]] was forced to resign and to emigrate to Switzerland for refusing to swear an oath to Hitler. The Jewish mathematician [[Felix Hausdorff]] was expelled from the university in 1935 and committed suicide after learning about his impending deportation to a concentration camp in 1942. The philosophers Paul Ludwig Landsberg and Johannes Maria Verweyen were deported and died in [[Nazi concentration camps|concentration camps]]. In 1937 [[Thomas Mann]] was deprived of his honorary doctorate. His honorary degree was restored in 1946.

During the [[World War II|second World War]] the university suffered heavy damage. An [[Strategic bombing during World War II|air raid]] on 18 October 1944 destroyed the main building.{{Citation needed|date=July 2017}}

===Post-war to modern day===
The university was re-opened on 17 November 1945 as one of the first in the [[Allied Occupation Zones in Germany|British occupation zone]]. The first university president was [[Heinrich Konen|Heinrich Matthias Konen]], who was expelled from the university in 1934 because of his opposition to [[Nazism]]. At the start of the first semester on 17 November 1945 the university had more than 10,000 applicants for only 2,500 places.

The university greatly expanded in the postwar period, in particular in the 1960s and 1970s. Significant events of the postwar era were the relocation of the university hospital from the city center to the [[Bonn#Districts|Venusberg]] in 1949, the opening of the new university library in 1960 and the opening of a new building, the Juridicum, for the School of Law and Economics in 1967.

In 1980 the Pedagogigal University Bonn was merged into the University of Bonn, although eventually all the teachers education programs were closed in 2007. In 1983 the new science library was opened. In 1989 [[Wolfgang Paul]] was awarded the [[Nobel Prize in Physics]]. Three years later [[Reinhard Selten]] was awarded the [[Nobel Prize in Economics]]. The decision of the German government to move the capital from Bonn to Berlin after the [[German reunification|reunification]] in 1991 resulted in generous compensation for the city of Bonn. The compensation package included three new research institutes affiliated or closely collaborating with the university, thus significantly enhancing the research profile of the University of Bonn.

In the 2000s the university implemented the [[Bologna process]] and replaced the traditional [[Diplom]] and [[Magister (degree)|Magister]] programs with Bachelor and Master programs. This process was completed by 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Campus==
The University of Bonn does not have a centralized campus. The main building is the ''[[Electoral Palace, Bonn|Kurfürstliches Schloss]]'', the former residential palace of the prince-elector of Cologne in the city center. The main building was built by [[Enrico Zuccalli]] for the prince-elector of Cologne, [[Joseph Clemens of Bavaria]] from 1697–1705. Today it houses the faculty of humanities and theology and the university administration. The ''Hofgarten'', a large park in front of the main building is a popular place for students to meet, study and relax. The Hofgarten was repeatedly the place for political demonstrations as for example the demonstration against the [[NATO Double-Track Decision]] on 22 October 1981 with about 250,000 participants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt;

The school of law and economics, the main university library and several smaller departments are housed in modern buildings a short distance south of the main building. The department of psychology and the department of computer science are located in a northern suburb of Bonn.

The science departments and the main science library are located in Poppelsdorf and Endenich, west of the city center, and housed in a mix of historical and modern buildings. Notable is the Poppelsdorf Palace (German: ''Poppelsdorfer Schloss''), which was built from 1715 to 1753 by [[Robert de Cotte]] for [[Joseph Clemens of Bavaria]] and his successor [[Clemens August of Bavaria]]. Today the Poppelsdorf Palace houses the university's mineral collection and several science departments; its grounds are the university's [[botanical garden]] (the [[Botanische Gärten der Friedrich-Wilhelms-Universität Bonn]]).

The school of medicine is located on the Venusberg, a hill on the western edge of Bonn. Several residence halls are scattered across the city. In total the University of Bonn owns 371 buildings.

===University library===
[[File:2014-07-02 Hauptgebäude der Universitäts- und Landesbibliothek, Adenauerallee 39-41, Bonn-Südstadt IMG 2082.jpg|thumb|Building of the University Library]]
The university library was founded in 1818 and started with 6,000 volumes inherited from the library of the closed [[Gerhard Mercator University|University of Duisburg]]. In 1824 the library became [[legal deposit]] for all books published in the Prussian Rhine province. The library contained about 200,000 volumes at the end of the 19th century, and about 600,000 volumes at the outbreak of [[World War II]]. An [[Strategic bombing during World War II|air raid]] on 10 October 1944 destroyed about 200,000 volumes and a large part of the [[library catalog]]. After the war the library was housed in several makeshift locations until the completion of the new central library in 1960. The new building was designed by [[Pierre Vago]] and Fritz Bornemann and is located close to the main building. In 1983 a new library building was opened in Poppelsdorf, west of the main building. The new library building houses the science, agriculture and medicine collections. Today, the university library system comprises the central library, the library for science, agriculture and medicine and about 160 smaller libraries. It holds 2.2 million volumes and subscribes to about 14,000 journals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

===University hospital===

[[File:Bundesarchiv B 145 Bild-F001141-0003, Bonn, Universitäts-Kinderklinik.jpg|thumb|A nurse attending to an infant in the University Hospital of Bonn in November 1953]]
The university hospital (German:''Universitätsklinikum Bonn'') was founded at the same time as the university and officially opened on 5 May 1819 in the Poppelsdorf Palace (German:''Poppelsdorfer Schloss'') west of the main building. In its first year, the hospital had thirty beds, performed 93 surgeries and treated about 600 outpatients. In 1883 the hospital moved to a new building in the city center of Bonn, and after [[World War II]] to the [[Bonn#Districts|Venusberg]] on the western edge of Bonn. On 1 January 2001 the university hospital became a public corporation. Although the university hospital is since then independent from the university, the School of Medicine of the University of Bonn and the university hospital closely collaborate. Today the university hospital comprises about thirty individual hospitals, employs more than 670 physicians and more than 1,100 nursing and clinical support staff and treated about 39,000 inpatients.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The '''[[Akademisches Kunstmuseum]]''' (English: ''Academic Museum of Antiquities'' ) was founded in 1818 and has one of the largest collections of plaster casts of ancient Greek and Roman sculptures in the world. At this time collections of plaster casts were mainly used in the instruction of students at art academies. They were first used in the instruction of university students in 1763 by [[Christian Gottlob Heyne]] at [[Georg-August University of Göttingen|University of Göttingen]]. The Akademisches Kunstmuseum in Bonn was the first of its kind, as at this time collections at other universities were scattered around universities libraries. The first director was [[Friedrich Gottlieb Welcker]], who also held a professorship of archaeology. His tenure was from 1819 until his retirement in 1854. He was succeeded by [[Otto Jahn]] and [[Friedrich Wilhelm Ritschl]], who shared the directorship. From 1870 to 1889 [[Reinhard Kekulé von Stradonitz]], nephew of the famous organic chemist [[Friedrich August Kekulé von Stradonitz]], was the director. In 1872 the museum moved to a new building that was formerly used by the department of anatomy. The building was constructed from 1823 to 1830 and designed by [[Karl Friedrich Schinkel]] and [[Hermann Friedrich Waesemann]]. Other directors of the museum were [[Georg Loeschcke]] (from 1889 to 1912), [[Franz Winter]] (from 1912 to 1929), [[Richard Delbrück]] (from 1929 to 1940), [[Ernst Langlotz]] (from 1944 to 1966), Nikolaus Himmelmann (from 1969 to 1994) and Harald Mielsch (since 1994). All directors, with the exception of [[Friedrich Wilhelm Ritschl]] held a professorship of archaeology at the university.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

===Faculties===
From the foundation in 1818 to 1928 the University of Bonn had five faculties, that is, the Faculty of Catholic Theology, the Faculty of Protestant Theology, the Faculty of Law and the Faculty of Arts and Science. In 1928, the Faculty of Law and the Department of Economics, that until then was part of the Faculty of Arts and Science, merged into the new Faculty of Law and Economics. In 1934 the until then independent Agricultural University Bonn-Poppelsdorf (German: ''Landwirtschaftliche Hochschule Bonn-Poppelsdorf'') was merged into the University of Bonn as the Faculty of Agricultural Science. In 1936, the science departments were separated from the Faculty of Arts and Science. Today the university is divided into seven faculties:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.uni-bonn.de/institutions/faculties/faculties|title=Faculties|website=University of Bonn|language=en|access-date=2018-02-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Bonn caesar.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Center of Advanced European Studies and Research]].]]
After the German Government's decision in 1991 to move the capital of Germany from Bonn to Berlin, the city of Bonn received generous compensation from the Federal Government. This led to the foundation of three research institutes in 1995, of which two are affiliated with the university:

* The '''[[Center for European Integration Studies]]''' (German: ''Zentrum für Europäische Integrationsforschung'') studies the legal, economic and social implications of the [[European integration]] process. The institute offers several graduate programs and organizes summer schools for students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

* The '''[[Center of Advanced European Studies and Research]] (CAESAR)''' is an interdisciplinary applied research institute. Research is conducted in the fields of nanotechnology, biotechnology and medical technology. The institute is a private foundation, but collaborates closely with the university.

The '''[[Institute for the Study of Labor]]''' (German: ''Forschungsinstitut zur Zukunft der Arbeit'') is a private research institute that is funded by [[Deutsche Post]]. The institute concentrates on research on labor economics, but is also offering policy advise on labor market issues. The institute also awards the annual ''IZA Prize in Labor Economics''. The department of economics of the University of Bonn and the institute closely cooperate.

The '''[[Max-Planck-Institut für Mathematik|Max Planck Institute for Mathematics]]''' (German: ''Max Planck-Institut für Mathematik'') is part of the ''[[Max-Planck-Gesellschaft]]'', a network of scientific research institutes in Germany. The institute was founded in 1980 by [[Friedrich Hirzebruch]].

The '''[[Max Planck Institute for Radio Astronomy]]''' (German: ''Max-Planck-Institut für Radioastronomie'') was founded in 1966 as an institute of the Max-Planck-Gesellschaft. It operates the radio telescope in [[Effelsberg]].

The '''[[Max Planck Institute for Research on Collective Goods]]''' (German: ''Max-Planck-Institut zur Erforschung von Gemeinschaftsgütern'') started as a research group in 1997 and was founded as an institute of the Max-Planck-Gesellschaft in 2003. The institute studies collective goods from a legal and economic perspective.

The '''Center for Economics and Neuroscience''' founded in 2009 by Christian Elger, [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz Prize]] winner [[Armin Falk]], Martin Reuter and Bernd Weber, provides an international platform for interdisciplinary work in [[neuroeconomics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cens.uni-bonn.de/|title=Website of the institute|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www3.uni-bonn.de/Pressemitteilungen/304-2011] Press release of the University of Bonn concerning the official welcoming of the center&lt;/ref&gt; It includes the Laboratory for Experimental Economics that can carry out computer-based behavioral experiments with up to 24 participants simultaneously, two [[magnetic resonance imaging]] (MRI) scanners for interactive behavioral experiments and functional imaging, as well as a biomolecular laboratory for genotyping different polymorphisms.

===Research===
University of Bonn researchers made fundamental contributions in the sciences and the humanities. In physics researchers developed the [[quadrupole ion trap]] and the [[Geissler tube]], discovered [[radio waves]], were instrumental in describing [[cathode rays]] and developed the [[variable star designation]]. In chemistry researchers made significant contributions to the understanding of [[alicyclic compound]]s and [[Benzene]]. In material science researchers have been instrumental in describing the [[lotus effect]]. In mathematics University of Bonn faculty made fundamental contributions to modern [[topology]] and [[algebraic geometry]]. The [[Hirzebruch–Riemann–Roch theorem]], [[Lipschitz continuity]], the [[Petri net]], the [[Schönhage–Strassen algorithm]], [[Faltings's theorem]] and the [[Toeplitz matrix]] are all named after University of Bonn mathematicians. University of Bonn economists made fundamental contributions to [[game theory]] and [[experimental economics]]. Famous thinkers that were faculty at the University of Bonn include the poet [[August Wilhelm Schlegel]], the historian [[Barthold Georg Niebuhr]], the theologians [[Karl Barth]] and [[Pope Benedict XVI|Joseph Ratzinger]] and the poet [[Ernst Moritz Arndt]].

The university has nine collaborative research centres and five research units funded by the [[Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft|German Science Foundation]] and attracts more than 75 million Euros in external research funding annually.

The Excellence Initiative of the German government in 2006 resulted in the foundation of the [[Hausdorff Center for Mathematics]] as one of the seventeen national ''Clusters of Excellence'' that were part of the initiative and the expansion of the already existing [[Bonn Graduate School of Economics]] (BGSE).
The ''Excellence Initiative'' also resulted in the founding of the [[Bonn-Cologne Graduate School of Physics and Astronomy]] (an honors Masters and PhD program, jointly with the [[University of Cologne]]). [http://www.bctp.uni-bonn.de/ Bethe Center for Theoretical Physics] was founded in the November 2008, to foster closer interaction between mathematicians and theoretical physicists at Bonn. The center also arranges for regular visitors and seminars (on topics including String theory, Nuclear physics, Condensed matter etc.).
