The '''Alberta-British Columbia foothills forests''' are a [[temperate coniferous forests]] [[ecoregion]] of [[Canada]]. This ecoregion borders Canada's [[taiga]] and contains a mix of [[subarctic]] forest and [[temperate]] forest species as a result. This makes the region an [[ecotone]] region, or a region that acts as a buffer between two other [[biome]]s.

==Setting==
This ecoregion covers two separate areas: the rolling foothills of the [[Canadian Rockies|Rocky Mountains]] in [[Alberta]], and further west a smaller area of the hills and valleys of central [[British Columbia]]. The [[Clear Hills]] in the north of the region are steeper.&lt;ref&gt;{{WWF ecoregion|name=Alberta-British Columbia foothills forests|id=na0502}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Average annual temperature vary from -0.5°C to 2°C, with the summer temperatures around 14°C dropping in winter to -17.5°C in the north and -10°C in the south.

==Flora==
The forests are a mixture dominated by [[lodgepole pine]] (''Pinus contorta''), [[jack pine]] (''Pinus banksiana''), trembling aspen (''[[Populus tremuloides]]''), [[black spruce]] (''Picea mariana''), and white spruce (''[[Picea glauca]]''). Other trees include balsam poplar (''[[populus balsamifera]]''), paper birch (''[[Betula papyrifera]]'') and balsam fir (''[[Abies balsamifera]]'').

==Fauna==
These foothills are home to the largest herds of [[moose]] (''Alces alces'') in North America. Not only are the moose plentiful, but there are two [[subspecies]] of moose: the smaller Shiras moose (''Alces alces shirasi'') of the Rocky Mountains and the larger [[western moose]] (''Alces alces andersoni'') of Canada. It is not known if the two subspecies hybridize in areas where they meet.

Other mammals include [[snowshoe hare]] (''Lepus americanus''), [[boreal woodland caribou|caribou]] (''rangier tarandus''), [[North American beaver|beaver]] (''Castor canadensis''), [[muskrat]] (''Ondatra zibethica''), [[northwestern wolf|wolf]] (''Canis lupus occidentalis'') and two subspecies of [[American black bear|black bear]] the cinnamon bear (''Ursus americanus cinnamomum'') of the Rocky Mountains and the eastern black bear (''Ursus americanus americanus'') of the Canadian [[Taiga]].

Birds of the area include [[sandhill crane]]s (''Grus canadensis''), [[ruffed grouse]] (''Bonasa umbellus''), [[spruce grouse]] (''Falcipennis canadensis'') and large numbers of waterbirds and [[New World warbler]]s (Parulidae).

==Threats and preservation==
These forests have been extensively altered by human activity, especially clearance for planting.

'''Anthony Keeling Collett''' (22 August 1877 – 22 August 1929) was an author and writer on [[natural history]] subjects and was nature correspondent for ''[[The Times]]'' during the 1910s and 1920s.

Collett's father was the Reverend William Collett, a former fellow of [[Oriel College, Oxford]]. He was born at [[Cromhall]], Gloucestershire, where his father held the [[Benefice|living]] that was dispensed by Oriel College, and was educated privately at [[Crowthorne]] and then at [[Bradfield College|Bradfield School]] before being awarded a scholarship to study Classics at Oriel. After graduating he was awarded a college scholarship that enabled him to spend some time at the [[University of Berlin]].&lt;ref name="times"&gt;{{cite newspaper |title=Mr. Anthony Collett |newspaper=The Times |location=London, England |date=23 August 1929 |page=14 |issue=45289}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Collett began work as a journalist for the ''[[St. James's Gazette]]'' in London, where he wrote on many subjects. From 1908, he also contributed to ''The Times'', although not as a staff member until after [[World War I]]. He enlisted in the [[Post Office Rifles]] for that war, initially as a private and later as a commissioned officer. After fighting at [[Vimy Ridge]], Collett, who was in any case generally not a particularly healthy man, was invalided home and served the rest of the war working in the [[War Office]].&lt;ref name="times" /&gt;

He was not enamoured of London and regularly lived and produced his writings from other places, including in the [[Italian Alps]], [[Scotland]] and [[Wales]]. During the war, he had managed occasionally to write articles while in France. He died in a  London nursing home on 22 August 1929, on his 52nd birthday, having suffered a significant decline in his already poor health in the previous two years. That decline may have been related to his war service.&lt;ref name="times" /&gt;

Collett retained an affection for Bradfield School and was a governor there for many years.&lt;ref name="times" /&gt;

[[W. H. Auden]] used many phrases from Collett's ''Changing Face of England'' in his poems.{{cn|date=August 2014}}

The Chase, a {{convert|130|acre|km2|adj=on}} woodland in [[Woolton Hill]], was dedicated to the memory of Collett (according to a plaque on the site) when the land was presented to the [[National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty]] in 1944 by Sir [[Kenneth Swan]] as a nature reserve and bird sanctuary.

==Bibliography==
Among Collett's publications are:

*''A Handbook of British Inland Birds'' (1906)
*''The English Year'' (three volumes, co-authored with William Beach Thomas; T. C. &amp; E. C. Jack, 1913–14)
*''Birds Through The Year'' (co-authored with William Beach Thomas; T. C. &amp; E. C. Jack, 1922)
*''The Changing Year'' (undated)
*''The Changing Face of England'' (1926)
*''The Heart of a Bird'' (1927)

The '''Banda Arc''' (main arc, Inner, and Outer) is a set of [[island arcs]] that exist in eastern [[Indonesia]]. It manifests the collision of a [[continent]] and an intra-oceanic [[island arc]]. The presently active arc is located on what appears to be [[oceanic crust]] whereas the associated [[subduction]] trench is underlain by [[continental crust]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00371896|title = Origin of late-cenozoic lavas from the Banda arc, Indonesia: Trace element and Sr isotope evidence|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |author1=D.

== Terminology ==
Some academic literature refers to the arcs by location – so that main arc can be referred to as the 'southern',&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | author1=Ely, Kim Susan | title=Geochronology of Timor-Leste and seismo-tectonics of the southern Banda Arc | publication-date=2009 | url=http://trove.nla.gov.au/work/37054964 | accessdate=21 December 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the 'western' &lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | author1=Chamalaun, F.

It is a complex [[subduction]] setting (where one plate moves under another, sinking into the Earth's [[Mantle (geology)|mantle]]), with possibly the largest fold on [[Earth]], extending to a depth of about {{convert|650|km|0|abbr=on}}, in a subducted plate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = |title = Indonesia's puzzling Banda arc: New findings explain mystery behind geological development|last = University of Royal Holloway London|first = |date = July 27, 2010|work = |access-date = |via = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Inner/Outer ==
[[File:Banda-arc-cross-section.jpg|thumb|Cross section between inner and outer arc]]
The '''Banda Arc''' is a double [[island arc]] formed by the collision of the [[Indo-Australian plate]] with the [[Eurasian plate]]. Principal islands include [[Timor]], [[Flores]], and [[Seram Island|Seram]].
* The '''Inner Banda Arc''' consists of a string of recent and active volcanic islands from [[Komodo Island|Komodo]] to [[Kekeh-besar]] of the [[Barat Daya Islands]], including Flores, [[Solor Archipelago|Solor]], [[Alor Archipelago|Alor]], [[Wetar]], and [[Damar Island|Damar]].
* The '''Outer Banda Arc''' is older and non-volcanic. It overlies the margin of the Pre-Cambrian [[craton]] that makes up much of the continent of Australia. It stretches from [[Savu Island|Savu]] through [[Rote Island|Rote]], [[Timor]], [[Leti Islands|Leti]], [[Babar Islands|Babar]], [[Tanimbar Islands|Tanimbar]], and the [[Kai Islands]], before turning west to [[Seram Island|Seram]], [[Ambon Island|Ambon]], and [[Buru Island|Buru]]. The outer arc is geologically associated with the Australian continent, though it is a more recent accretion than the neighbouring [[Aru Islands]].

The feature they apparently formed is a 180-degree [[Island arc|arc]], which is more than {{convert|1,000|km|mi|abbr=off}} long. Geographically, it stretches across eastern [[Indonesia]], and is delimited by an active inner [[Volcano|volcanic]] arc. The outer arc contains numerous [[island]]s, and its internal [[Structure of the Earth|structure]] contains young [[oceanic crust]] exclusively.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://news.softpedia.com/news/Origins-of-the-Banda-Arc-Explained-151114.shtml|title = Origins of the Banda Arc Explained|last = Tudor Vieru|date = 6 Aug 2010|work = |access-date = |via = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3342">'''Biometeorology''' is the [[Interdisciplinarity|interdisciplinary]] field of science that studies the interactions between the [[biosphere]] and the [[Earth's atmosphere]] on time scales of the order of seasons or shorter (by opposition to [[bioclimatology]]).

==Examples of relevant processes==
[[Weather]] events influence biological processes on short time scales. For instance, as the [[Sun]] rises above the horizon in the morning, light levels become sufficient for the process of [[photosynthesis]] to take place in plant [[Leaf|leaves]]. Later on, during the day, air [[temperature]] and [[humidity]] may induce the partial or total closure of the [[stoma]]ta, a typical response of many plants to limit the loss of water through [[transpiration]]. More generally, the daily evolution of meteorological variables controls the [[circadian rhythm]] of plants and animals alike.

Living organisms, for their part, can collectively affect weather patterns. The rate of [[evapotranspiration]] of forests, or of any large vegetated area for that matter, contributes to the release of [[water vapor]] in the atmosphere. This local, relatively fast and continuous process may contribute significantly to the persistence of [[precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]]s in a given area. As another example, the [[wilting]] of plants results in definite changes in [[leaf angle distribution]] and therefore modifies the rates of [[Reflection (physics)|reflection]], [[Transmittance|transmission]] and [[Absorption (electromagnetic radiation)|absorption]] of solar light in these plants. That, in turn, changes the [[albedo]] of the ecosystem as well as the relative importance of the [[Sensible heat|sensible]] and [[latent heat]] fluxes from the surface to the atmosphere. For an example in [[oceanography]], consider the release of [[dimethyl sulfide]] by biological activity in sea water and its impact on atmospheric [[aerosol]]s.

==Human biometeorology==
The methods and measurements traditionally used in biometeorology are not different when applied to study the interactions between human bodies and the atmosphere, but some aspects or applications may have been explored more extensively. For instance, [[wind chill]] has been investigated to determine the time period an individual can sustain exposure to given temperature and wind conditions. Another important example concerns the study of airborne [[allergen]]s (such as [[pollen]]s and [[aerosol]]s) and their impact on individuals: [[weather]] conditions can favor or hinder the release as well as the transport and deposition of these allergens, sometimes severely affecting the well-being of sensitive populations.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="58195">{{For|caloric restriction for the purpose of weight loss|dieting}}
'''Calorie restriction''', or '''caloric restriction''', or '''energy restriction''', is a [[Diet (nutrition)|dietary regimen]] that reduces calorie intake without incurring [[malnutrition]] or a reduction in [[essential nutrient]]s. "Reduce" can be defined relative to the subject's previous intake before intentionally restricting calories, or relative to an average person of similar body type. Commonly consumed food components containing calories are [[carbohydrate]]s, [[protein]]s and [[fat]].

In preliminary research, some non-human species on calorie restriction diets without malnutrition may exhibit slowing of the [[Senescence|biological aging process]], resulting in an increase in both [[median]] and [[maximum lifespan]],&lt;ref name=OmodeiFontana&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Omodei|first1=D|last2=Fontana|first2=L|title=Calorie restriction and prevention of age-associated chronic disease|journal=FEBS Lett|date=Jun 6, 2011|volume=585|issue=11|pages=1537–42|doi=10.1016/j.febslet.2011.03.015|pmid=21402069|url=http://www.febsletters.org/article/S0014-5793%2811%2900168-2/fulltext|accessdate=28 November 2015|pmc=3439843}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Anderson09"/&gt; but this effect is not universal.&lt;ref name="NIonA"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nia.nih.gov/health/publication/can-we-prevent-aging|title=Can We Prevent Aging?|publisher=National Institute on Aging, US National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD|date=29 July 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160926190905/https://www.nia.nih.gov/health/publication/can-we-prevent-aging|archive-date=26 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In humans, the long-term health effects of moderate caloric restriction with sufficient nutrients are unknown.&lt;ref name='Spindler, 2010'&gt;{{cite book |last1=Spindler |first1=Stephen R. |title=The Future of Aging |pages=367–438 |year=2010 |doi=10.1007/978-90-481-3999-6_12 |chapter=Biological Effects of Calorie Restriction: Implications for Modification of Human Aging |isbn=978-90-481-3998-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Health effects==

===Risks of malnutrition===
The term "calorie restriction" as used in gerontology refers to dietary regimens that reduce calorie intake without incurring [[malnutrition]].&lt;ref name='Spindler, 2010'/&gt; If a restricted diet is not designed to include essential nutrients, [[malnutrition]] may result in serious deleterious effects, as shown in the [[Minnesota Starvation Experiment]].&lt;ref name="Keys A 1950" /&gt; This study was conducted during World War II on a group of lean men, who restricted their calorie intake by 45%&lt;ref&gt;Keys A 1950, p. 114.&lt;/ref&gt; for 6 months and composed roughly 77%&lt;ref&gt;Keys A 1950, pp. 1213–1214.&lt;/ref&gt; of their diet with carbohydrates.&lt;ref name="Keys A 1950"&gt;Keys A, Brozek J, Henschels A &amp; Mickelsen O &amp; Taylor H. The Biology of Human Starvation, 1950. University of Minnesota Press, Minneapolis&lt;/ref&gt; As expected, this malnutrition resulted in many positive [[Starvation response|metabolic adaptations]] (e.g. decreased body fat, blood pressure, improved lipid profile, low serum [[Triiodothyronine|T3]] concentration, and decreased resting heart rate and whole-body resting energy expenditure), but also caused a wide range of negative effects, such as [[anemia]], [[edema]], [[Muscle atrophy|muscle wasting]], [[weakness]], [[neurological deficits]], [[dizziness]], [[irritability]], [[lethargy]], and depression.&lt;ref name=Kalm-Semba /&gt;

====Musculoskeletal losses====
Short-term studies in humans report a loss of  [[muscle mass]] and strength and reduced [[bone mineral density]].&lt;ref name="A"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Morley |first1=John E |last2=Chahla |first2=Elie |last3=Alkaade |first3=Saad |title=Antiaging, longevity and calorie restriction |journal=Current Opinion in Clinical Nutrition and Metabolic Care |volume=13 |issue=1 |pages=40–5 |year=2010 |pmid=19851100 |doi=10.1097/MCO.0b013e3283331384}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, whether or not the reduction in bone mineral density actually harms bone health is unclear.&lt;ref name=Gower2013&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gower BA, Casazza K|title=Divergent Effects of Obesity on Bone Health|journal=Journal of Clinical Densitometry|date=October–December 2013|volume=16|issue=4|pages=450–454|doi=10.1016/j.jocd.2013.08.010|pmid=24063845|pmc=5321047}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a study in premenopausal women, bone mineral density after weight loss was higher when normalized for body weight;&lt;ref name=Gower2013/&gt; reduced bone mineral density is also observed in humans undergoing long-term calorie restriction with adequate nutrition, but no fractures have been reported&lt;ref name=ABSMR2013&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Bonewald LF, Kiel DP, Clemens TL, Esser K, Orwoll ES, O'Keefe RJ, Fielding RA|title=Forum on bone and skeletal muscle interactions: Summary of the proceedings of an ASBMR workshop|journal=Journal of Bone and Mineral Research|date=September 2013|volume=28|issue=9|pages=1857–1865|doi=10.1002/jbmr.1980|pmid=23671010|pmc=3749267}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the reduction in bone mineral density was not associated with deleterious changes in bone microarchitecture.&lt;ref name=Gower2013/&gt;

The authors of a 2007 review of the caloric restriction literature warned that "[i]t is possible that even moderate calorie restriction may be harmful in specific patient populations, such as lean persons who have minimal amounts of body fat."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Fontana |first1=L. |last2=Klein |first2=S. |title=Aging, Adiposity, and Calorie Restriction |journal=JAMA |volume=297 |issue=9 |pages=986–94 |year=2007 |pmid=17341713 |doi=10.1001/jama.297.9.986}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Lower-than-normal body mass index, high mortality====
Caloric restriction diets typically lead to reduced body weight, yet reduced weight can come from other causes and is not in itself necessarily healthy. In some studies, low body weight has been associated with increased mortality, particularly in late middle-aged or elderly subjects. Low body weight in the elderly can be caused by pathological conditions associated with aging and predisposing to higher mortality (such as cancer, chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder, or depression) or of the [[cachexia]] (wasting syndrome) and [[sarcopenia]] (loss of muscle mass, structure, and function).&lt;ref name='Hu, 20008'&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Hu | first1 = Frank | title = Obesity Epidemiology | chapter = Interpreting Epidemiologic Evidence and Causal Inference in Obesity Research | editors = Frank B. Hu | publisher = Oxford University Press | year = 2008 | location = New York, NY | pages = 38–52 | url = http://www.oup.com/us/catalog/general/subject/Medicine/EpidemiologyBiostatistics/?view=usa&amp;ci=9780195312911 | accessdate = 2011-02-20 | isbn = 978-0-19-531291-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; One study linked a [[body mass index]] lower than 18 in women with increased mortality from noncancer, non−cardiovascular disease causes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Flegal |first1=K.

:"epidemiologists from the ACS ([[American Cancer Society]]), [[American Heart Association]], [[Harvard School of Public Health]], and other organizations raised specific methodologic questions about the recent [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] study and presented analyses of other data sets. The main concern ... is that it did not adequately account for weight loss from serious illnesses such as cancer and heart disease ... [and] failed to account adequately for the effect of smoking on weight ... As a result, the Flegal study underestimated the risks from obesity and overestimated the risks of leanness."&lt;ref name='American Cancer Society, 2005'&gt;{{cite journal |title=Researchers weigh risks due to overweight |journal=CA: A Cancer Journal for Clinicians |volume=55 |pages=268–9 |year=2005 |doi=10.3322/canjclin.55.5.268 |issue=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Such [[epidemiology|epidemiological studies]] of body weight are not about caloric restriction as used in anti-aging studies; they are not about caloric intake to begin with, as body weight is influenced by many factors other than energy intake, Moreover, "the quality of the diets consumed by the low-body mass index individuals are difficult to assess, and may lack nutrients important to longevity."&lt;ref name="Spindler, 2010"/&gt; Typical low-calorie diets rarely provide the high nutrient intakes that are a necessary feature of an anti-aging calorie restriction diet.&lt;ref name='St. Jeor et al, 2001'&gt;{{cite journal |last1=St. Jeor |first1=S.

====Triggering binge eating====
In those who have a [[binge-eating]] disorder, calorie restriction can precipitate an episode of binge eating, but it does not seem to pose any such risk otherwise.&lt;ref name=binge&gt;{{cite book|title=Binge-Eating Disorder: Clinical Foundations and Treatment|edition=1|year=2007|publisher=The Guilford Press|isbn=978-1-59385-594-9|page=15|quote=It can be concluded that caloric restriction does not appear to be associated with the development of binge eating in individuals who have never reported problems with binge eating.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Young or pregnant====
Long-term caloric restriction at a level sufficient for slowing the [[aging]] process is generally not recommended in [[children]], [[adolescents]], and [[youth|young adults]] (under the age of approximately 21), because this type of diet may interfere with natural physical growth, as has been observed in [[laboratory animals]]. In addition, mental development and physical changes to the [[brain]] take place in late adolescence and early adulthood that could be negatively affected by severe caloric restriction.&lt;ref name="D"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.crsociety.org/Risks |title=Risks |accessdate=2010-07-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100919211635/http://crsociety.org/Risks |archivedate=2010-09-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pregnant]] women and women trying to become pregnant are advised not to practice calorie restriction, because low BMI may result in ovulatory dysfunction ([[infertility]]), and underweight mothers are more prone to [[preterm delivery]].&lt;ref name="D"/&gt;

====Miscellaneous concerns====
It has also been noted that people losing weight on such diets risk developing [[cold sensitivity]], [[menstrual irregularities]], [[infertility]], and hormonal changes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|pmc=2786899 |title=Cellular mechanisms of cardioprotection by calorie restriction: state of the science and future perspectives |date=2012-10-19 |pmid=19944269 |doi=10.1016/j.cger.2009.07.002 |volume=25 |issue=4 |journal=Clin.

S. |last6=Leeuwenburgh |first6=C }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Temperature===
Caloric restriction lowers the core body temperature, a phenomenon believed to be an adaptive response to reduce energy expenditure when nutrients availability is limited. Lowering the temperature may prolong the lifespan of cold blooded animals. Mice, which are warm blooded, have been engineered to have a reduced core body temperature which increased the lifespan independently of calorie restriction.&lt;ref name="Conti B 2006"/&gt;

===Hormesis===
{{Main|Hormesis}}
Some research has pointed toward hormesis as an explanation for the benefits of caloric restriction, representing beneficial actions linked to a low-intensity biological stressor such as reduced calorie intake.&lt;ref name=Rimbach2015/&gt; As a potential role for caloric restriction, the diet imposes a low-intensity biological stress on the organism, eliciting a defensive response that may help protect it against the disorders of aging.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=21931183|pmc=3227447|year=2011|author1=Martins|first1=I|title=Hormesis, cell death and aging|journal=Aging|volume=3|issue=9|pages=821–8|last2=Galluzzi|first2=L|last3=Kroemer|first3=G|doi=10.18632/aging.100380}}&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, caloric restriction places the organism in a defensive state so that it can survive adversity, resulting in improved health and longer life.&lt;ref name=Rimbach2015/&gt; This switch to a defensive state may be controlled by [[longevity genes]] (see below).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Mattson |first1=M |title=Dietary Factors, Hormesis and Health |journal=Ageing Research Reviews |volume=7 |issue=1 |pages=43–8 |year=2008 |pmid=17913594 |pmc=2253665 |doi=10.1016/j.arr.2007.08.004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Evolution===
It has been recently argued that during years of famine, it may be evolutionarily desirable for an organism to avoid reproduction and to up-regulate protective and repair enzyme mechanisms to ensure that it is fit for reproduction in future years. This argument seems to be supported by recent work studying hormones. Prolonged severe CR lowers total serum and free testosterone while increasing [[sex hormone binding globulin]] concentrations in humans; these effects are independent of adiposity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Cangemi |first1=Roberto |last2=Friedmann |first2=Alberto J. |last3=Holloszy |first3=John O. |last4=Fontana |first4=Luigi |title=Long-term effects of calorie restriction on serum sex-hormone concentrations in men |journal=Aging Cell |volume=9 |issue=2 |pages=236–42 |year=2010 |pmid=20096034 |doi=10.1111/j.1474-9726.2010.00553.x |pmc=3569090}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{See also|Insulin#Physiological effects}}

Lowering of the concentration of [[insulin]] and substances related to insulin, such as [[insulin-like growth factor 1]] and [[growth hormone]], has been shown to up-regulate [[autophagy]], the repair mechanism of the cell.&lt;ref name="Bergamini"/&gt; A related hypothesis suggests that caloric restriction works by decreasing [[insulin]] levels and thereby up-regulating [[autophagy (cellular)|autophagy]],&lt;ref name="Bergamini"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Bergamini |first1=E |last2=Cavallini |first2=G |last3=Donati |first3=A |last4=Gori |first4=Z |title=The anti-ageing effects of caloric restriction may involve stimulation of macroautophagy and lysosomal degradation, and can be intensified pharmacologically |journal=Biomedecine &amp; Pharmacotherapy |volume=57 |pages=203–8 |year=2003 |doi=10.1016/S0753-3322(03)00048-9 |issue=5–6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Cuervo |first1=Ana Maria |last2=Bergamini |first2=Ettore |last3=Brunk |first3=Ulf T |last4=Dröge |first4=Wulf |last5=Ffrench |first5=Martine |last6=Terman |first6=Alexei |title=Autophagy and Aging: the Importance of Maintaining "Clean" Cells |journal=Autophagy |volume=1 |issue=3 |pages=131–40 |year=2005 |pmid=16874025 |doi=10.4161/auto.1.3.2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; but caloric restriction affects many other health indicators, and it is still undecided whether insulin is the main concern.&lt;ref name="Mattson05"/&gt; Calorie restriction has been shown to increase [[DHEA]] in primates, but it has not been shown to increase [[DHEA]] in post-pubescent primates.&lt;ref name="mattison"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1038/ncomms14063|pmid=28094793|pmc=5247583|title=Caloric restriction improves health and survival of rhesus monkeys|journal=Nature Communications|volume=8|pages=14063|year=2017|last1=Mattison|first1=Julie A|last2=Colman|first2=Ricki J|last3=Beasley|first3=T Mark|last4=Allison|first4=David B|last5=Kemnitz|first5=Joseph W|last6=Roth|first6=George S|last7=Ingram|first7=Donald K|last8=Weindruch|first8=Richard|last9=De Cabo|first9=Rafael|last10=Anderson|first10=Rozalyn M|bibcode=2017NatCo...814063M}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Urbanski |first1=H F. |last2=Downs |first2=J L |last3=Garyfallou |first3=V T |last4=Mattison |first4=J A |last5=Lane |first5=M A |last6=Roth |first6=G S |last7=Ingram |first7=D K |title=Effect of Caloric Restriction on the 24-Hour Plasma DHEAS and Cortisol Profiles of Young and Old Male Rhesus Macaques |journal=Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences |volume=1019 |pages=443–7 |year=2004 |pmid=15247063 |doi=10.1196/annals.1297.081}}&lt;/ref&gt; The extent to which these findings apply to humans is still under investigation.

Work on the mechanisms of caloric restriction has given hope to the synthesizing of future drugs to increase the human lifespan by simulating the effects of calorie restriction. In particular, the large number of genes and pathways reported to regulate the actions of caloric restriction in model organisms represent attractive targets for developing drugs that mimic the benefits of CR without its side effects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Minor|first=RK|author2=Allard, JS |author3=Younts, CM |author4=Ward, TM |author5= de Cabo, R |title=Dietary interventions to extend life span and health span based on calorie restriction|journal=The Journals of Gerontology.

====Biomarkers for cardiovascular risk====

A review of the effects of calorie restriction on the aging heart and vasculature concluded that "Data from animal and human studies indicate that [beyond the effects of "implementation of healthier diets and regular exercise"], more drastic interventions, i.e., calorie restriction with adequate nutrition (CRAN), may have additional beneficial effects on several metabolic and molecular factors that are modulating cardiovascular aging itself (e.g., cardiac and arterial stiffness and heart rate variability)."&lt;ref name=WeissFontana2011&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Weiss|first1=EP|last2=Fontana|first2=L|title=Caloric restriction: powerful protection for the aging heart and vasculature|journal=Am J Physiol Heart Circ Physiol|date=Oct 2011|volume=301|issue=4|pages=H1205–19|doi=10.1152/ajpheart.00685.2011|pmid=21841020|url=http://ajpheart.physiology.org/content/301/4/H1205.long|accessdate=27 August 2014|pmc=3197347}}&lt;/ref&gt; Studies of long-term practitioners of rigorous calorie restriction show that their risk factors for atherosclerosis are substantially improved in a manner consistent with experimental studies in rodent models of atherosclerosis and nonhuman primates.&lt;ref name=WeissFontana2011 /&gt; Risk factors such as [[c-reactive protein]]; serum [[triglycerides]], [[low-density lipoprotein]], [[high-density lipoprotein]]; [[hypertension|blood pressure]]; and fasting blood sugar, are substantially more favorable than persons consuming usual Western diets and comparable or better than long-term endurance exercisers.&lt;ref name=WeissFontana2011 /&gt; Similar effects were also seen during a "natural experiment" in [[Biosphere 2]],&lt;ref name=WeissFontana2011 /&gt; and effects on blood pressure, cholesterol level, and resting heart rate were seen in subjects in the “[[Minnesota Starvation Experiment]]” during World War II.&lt;ref name=Kalm-Semba /&gt; Cardiac "diastolic function was better in subjects who practiced strict calorie restriction for 3–15 years than that in healthy age- and sex-matched control subjects ... calorie restriction subjects had less ventricular stiffness and less viscous loss of diastolic recoil, both of which would be consistent with less myocardial fibrosis.&lt;ref name=WeissFontana2011 /&gt; "These effects, in combination with other benefits of calorie restriction, such as protection against obesity, diabetes, hypertension, and cancer, suggest that CR may have a major beneficial effect on health span, life span, and quality of life in humans."&lt;ref name=WeissFontana2011 /&gt;

===Primates===

In a 2017 collaborative report on rhesus monkeys by scientists of the US National Institute on Aging and the University of Wisconsin, caloric restriction in the presence of adequate nutrition was effective in delaying the effects of aging.&lt;ref name=mattison/&gt;&lt;ref name="sd"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2017/01/170117140105.htm|title=Calorie restriction lets monkeys live long and prosper|publisher=ScienceDirect|date=17 January 2017|accessdate=15 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Older age of onset, female sex, lower body weight and fat mass, reduced food intake, diet quality, and lower [[fasting]] [[blood glucose]] levels were factors associated with fewer disorders of aging and with improved survival rates.&lt;ref name=mattison/&gt;&lt;ref name=sd/&gt; Specifically, reduced food intake was beneficial in adult and older primates, but not in younger monkeys.&lt;ref name=mattison/&gt; The study indicated that caloric restriction provided health benefits with fewer age-related disorders in elderly monkeys and, because rhesus monkeys are genetically similar to humans, the benefits and mechanisms of caloric restriction may apply to human health during aging.&lt;ref name=mattison/&gt;

===Yeast===
Fungi models are very easy to manipulate, and many crucial steps toward the understanding of aging have been made with them. Many studies were undertaken on budding yeast and fission yeast to analyze the cellular mechanisms behind increased longevity due to calorie restriction. First, calorie restriction is often called dietary restriction because the same effects on life span can be achieved by only changing the nutrient quality without changing the number of calories. Data from Guarente and others showed that genetic manipulations in nutrient-signaling pathways could mimic the effects of dietary restriction. In some cases, dietary restriction requires mitochondrial respiration to increase longevity (chronological aging), and in some other cases not (replicative aging). Nutrient sensing in yeast controls stress defense, mitochondrial functions, Sir2, and others. These functions are all known to regulate aging. Genes involved in these mechanisms are TOR, PKA, SCH9, MSN2/4, RIM15, and SIR2.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Kaeberlein |first1=Matt |last2=Burtner |first2=Christopher R. |last3=Kennedy |first3=Brian K. |title=Recent Developments in Yeast Aging |journal=PLoS Genetics |volume=3 |issue=5 |pages=e84 |year=2007 |pmid=17530929 |pmc=1877880 |doi=10.1371/journal.pgen.0030084}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Dilova |first1=I. |last2=Easlon |first2=E. |last3=Lin |first3=S. -J. |title=Calorie restriction and the nutrient sensing signaling pathways |journal=Cellular and Molecular Life Sciences |volume=64 |issue=6 |pages=752–67 |year=2007 |pmid=17260088 |doi=10.1007/s00018-007-6381-y}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Chen |first1=D |last2=Guarente |first2=L |title=SIR2: a potential target for calorie restriction mimetics |journal=Trends in Molecular Medicine |volume=13 |issue=2 |pages=64–71 |year=2007 |pmid=17207661 |doi=10.1016/j.molmed.2006.12.004}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Piper |first1=Peter W. |title=Long-lived yeast as a model for ageing research |journal=Yeast |volume=23 |issue=3 |pages=215–26 |year=2006 |pmid=16498698 |doi=10.1002/yea.1354}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Longo |first1=V |title=Linking sirtuins, IGF-I signaling, and starvation |journal=Experimental Gerontology |volume=44 |issue=1–2 |pages=70–4 |year=2009 |pmid=18638538 |doi=10.1016/j.exger.2008.06.005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Importantly, yeast responses to CR can be modulated by genetic background.

===Behavior===
Observations in some accounts of animals undergoing calorie restriction have noted an increase in [[Stereotypy (non-human)|stereotyped behaviors]].&lt;ref name="KV" /&gt; For example, monkeys on calorie restriction have demonstrated an increase in licking, sucking, and rocking behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Weed J.

===Obese controls===
It has sometimes been suggested that the lives of calorie-restricted animals are only extended relative to control animals whose lives are artificially shortened by weight-gain from unnatural ad libitum feeding in the laboratory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Sohala Rajindar S. |author2=Forster Michael J. | year = 2014 | title = Caloric restriction and the aging process: a critique | url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0891584914002317 | journal = Free Radical Biology and Medicine | volume = 73 | issue = | pages = 366–382 | doi=10.1016/j.freeradbiomed.2014.05.015|pmid=24941891 |pmc=4111977 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, studies designed to test this hypothesis suggest that reduced fat mass is not a major contributor to the longevity effects of calorie restriction.&lt;ref name='Spindler, 2010'/&gt;

'''Carl Edward Sagan''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|s|eɪ|ɡ|ən}}; November 9, 1934{{spaced ndash}}December 20, 1996) was an American [[astronomer]], [[physical cosmology|cosmologist]], [[Astrophysics|astrophysicist]], [[Astrobiology|astrobiologist]], author, science popularizer, and [[science communicator]] in astronomy and other natural sciences. He is best known for his work as a science popularizer and communicator. His best known scientific contribution is research on [[extraterrestrial life]], including experimental demonstration of the production of [[amino acids]] from basic chemicals by [[radiation]]. Sagan assembled the first physical messages sent into space: the [[Pioneer plaque]] and the [[Voyager Golden Record]], universal messages that could potentially be understood by any extraterrestrial intelligence that might find them. Sagan argued the now accepted hypothesis that the high surface temperatures of [[Venus]] can be attributed to and calculated using the [[greenhouse effect]].&lt;ref name=surftemp&gt;{{cite book |title=Conversations with Carl Sagan |edition=illustrated |first1=Carl |last1=Sagan |first2=Tom |last2=Head |publisher=Univ.

Sagan published more than 600 scientific papers and articles and was author, co-author or editor of more than 20 books.&lt;ref name="scholar"/&gt; He wrote many [[popular science]] books, such as ''[[The Dragons of Eden]]'', ''[[Broca's Brain]]'' and ''[[Pale Blue Dot (book)|Pale Blue Dot]]'', and narrated and co-wrote the award-winning 1980 television series ''[[Cosmos: A Personal Voyage]]''.  The most widely watched series in the history of American [[public television]], ''Cosmos'' has been seen by at least 500 million people across 60 different countries.&lt;ref name =Starchild&gt;{{cite web | url=http://starchild.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/StarChild/whos_who_level2/sagan.html | title=StarChild: Dr. Carl Sagan |work=StarChild | publisher=[[NASA]] | accessdate=October 8, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book ''[[Cosmos (Carl Sagan book)|Cosmos]]'' was published to accompany the series. He also wrote the science fiction novel ''[[Contact (novel)|Contact]]'', the basis for a 1997 [[Contact (1997 American film)|film of the same name]]. His papers, containing 595,000 items,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Seth MacFarlane Collection of the Carl Sagan and Ann Druyan Archive: A Finding Aid to the Collection in the Library of Congress|date=2013|publisher=Manuscript Division, Library of Congress|url=http://rs5.loc.gov/service/mss/eadxmlmss/eadpdfmss/2013/ms013113.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; are archived at [[The Library of Congress]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Lowensohn|first1=Josh|title=Massive Carl Sagan archive posted by Library of Congress|url=https://www.theverge.com/2014/2/4/5379446/massive-carl-sagan-archive-posted-by-library-of-congress|accessdate=16 January 2016|publisher=The Verge|date=February 4, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sagan advocated [[Scientific skepticism|scientific skeptical inquiry]] and the [[scientific method]], pioneered [[exobiology]] and promoted the Search for Extra-Terrestrial Intelligence ([[Search for extraterrestrial intelligence|SETI]]). He spent most of his career as a professor of astronomy at [[Cornell University]], where he directed the Laboratory for [[Planetary science|Planetary Studies]]. Sagan and his works received numerous awards and honors, including the [[NASA Distinguished Public Service Medal]], the [[National Academy of Sciences]] [[Public Welfare Medal]], the [[Pulitzer Prize for General Non-Fiction]] for his book ''The Dragons of Eden'', and, regarding ''Cosmos: A Personal Voyage'', two [[Emmy Award]]s, the [[Peabody Award]], and the [[Hugo Award]]. He married three times and had five children. After suffering from [[myelodysplastic syndrome|myelodysplasia]], Sagan died of [[pneumonia]] at the age of 62, on December 20, 1996.

== Early life and education==
Carl Sagan was born in [[Brooklyn]], New York.&lt;ref name=poundstone&gt;[[#Poundstone|Poundstone 1999]], pp. 363–364, 374–375&lt;/ref&gt; His father, Samuel Sagan, was an immigrant [[Sewing|garment worker]] from [[Kamianets-Podilskyi]], then in the [[Russian Empire]],&lt;ref name="Internet Accuracy Project"&gt;{{cite web |title=Carl Sagan |url=http://www.accuracyproject.org/cbe-Sagan,Carl.html |website=Internet Accuracy Project |publisher=Internet Accuracy Project |location=Grandville, MI |accessdate=August 22, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; in today's [[Ukraine]]. His mother, Rachel Molly Gruber, was a housewife from New York. Carl was named in honor of Rachel's [[biological mother]], Chaiya Clara, in Sagan's words, "the mother she never knew."&lt;!-- note: "she" is correct, refers to Rachel. Please do not turn this into "he" --&gt;&lt;ref name="Davidson"&gt;[[#Davidson|Davidson 1999]]&lt;/ref&gt;

He had a sister, Carol, and the family lived in a modest apartment near the [[Atlantic Ocean]], in [[Bensonhurst, Brooklyn|Bensonhurst]], a Brooklyn neighborhood. According to Sagan, they were [[Reform Judaism|Reform Jews]], the most liberal of North American Judaism's four main groups. Carl and his sister agreed that their father was not especially religious, but that their mother "definitely believed in God, and was active in the temple;... and served only [[Kosher foods|kosher]] meat."&lt;ref name="Davidson" /&gt;{{rp|12}} During the depths of the [[Great Depression|Depression]], his father worked as a theater usher.

According to biographer Keay Davidson, Sagan's "inner war" was a result of his close relationship with both of his parents, who were in many ways "opposites." Sagan traced his later analytical urges to his mother, a woman who had been extremely poor as a child in New York City during [[World War I]] and the 1920s.&lt;ref name="Davidson" /&gt;{{rp|2}} As a young woman she had held her own intellectual ambitions, but they were frustrated by social restrictions: her poverty, her status as a woman and a wife, and her Jewish ethnicity. Davidson notes that she therefore "worshipped her only son, Carl. He would fulfill her unfulfilled dreams."&lt;ref name="Davidson" /&gt;{{rp|2}}

However, he claimed that his sense of wonder came from his father, who in his free time gave apples to the poor or helped soothe labor-management tensions within New York's garment industry.&lt;ref name="Davidson" /&gt;{{rp|2}} Although he was awed by Carl's intellectual abilities, he took his son's inquisitiveness in stride and saw it as part of his growing up.&lt;ref name="Davidson" /&gt;{{rp|2}} In his later years as a writer and scientist, Sagan would often draw on his childhood memories to illustrate scientific points, as he did in his book, ''[[Shadows of Forgotten Ancestors (book)|Shadows of Forgotten Ancestors]]''.&lt;ref name="Davidson" /&gt;{{rp|9}} Sagan describes his parents' influence on his later thinking:
{{quote|My parents were not scientists. They knew almost nothing about science. But in introducing me simultaneously to skepticism and to wonder, they taught me the two uneasily cohabiting modes of thought that are central to the scientific method.&lt;ref name="Spangenburg"&gt;[[#Spangenburg &amp; Moser|Spangenburg &amp; Moser 2004]], pp. 2–5&lt;/ref&gt;}}

=== 1939 World's Fair ===
Sagan recalls that one of his most defining moments was when his parents took him to the [[1939 New York World's Fair]] when he was four years old. The exhibits became a turning point in his life. He later recalled the moving map of the ''[[Futurama (New York World's Fair)|America of Tomorrow]]'' exhibit: "It showed beautiful highways and cloverleaves and little General Motors cars all carrying people to skyscrapers, buildings with lovely spires, flying buttresses—and it looked great!"&lt;ref name="Davidson" /&gt;{{rp|14}} At other exhibits, he remembered how a flashlight that shone on a [[Solar cell|photoelectric cell]] created a crackling sound, and how the sound from a [[tuning fork]] became a wave on an [[oscilloscope]]. He also witnessed the future media technology that would replace radio: television. Sagan wrote:
{{quote|Plainly, the world held wonders of a kind I had never guessed. How could a tone become a picture and light become a noise?&lt;ref name="Davidson" /&gt;{{rp|14}}}}

He also saw one of the Fair's most publicized events, the burial of a [[time capsule]] at [[Flushing Meadows–Corona Park|Flushing Meadows]], which contained mementos of the 1930s to be recovered by Earth's descendants in a future millennium. "The time capsule thrilled Carl," writes Davidson. As an adult, Sagan and his colleagues would create similar time capsules—capsules that would be sent out into the galaxy; these were the [[Pioneer plaque]] and the ''[[Voyager Golden Record]]'' précis, all of which were spinoffs of Sagan's memories of the World's Fair.&lt;ref name="Davidson" /&gt;{{rp|15}}

=== World War II ===
During [[World War&amp;nbsp;II]] Sagan's family worried about the fate of their European relatives. Sagan, however, was generally unaware of the details of the ongoing war. He wrote, "Sure, we had relatives who were caught up in the [[The Holocaust|Holocaust]]. [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]] was not a popular fellow in our household...&amp;nbsp;But on the other hand, I was fairly insulated from the horrors of the war." His sister, Carol, said that their mother "above all wanted to protect Carl...&amp;nbsp;She had an extraordinarily difficult time dealing with World War&amp;nbsp;II and the Holocaust."&lt;ref name="Davidson" /&gt;{{rp|15}} Sagan's book, ''[[The Demon-Haunted World]]'' (1996), included his memories of this conflicted period, when his family dealt with the realities of the war in Europe but tried to prevent it from undermining his optimistic spirit.&lt;ref name="Spangenburg" /&gt;

=== Inquisitiveness about nature ===
Soon after entering elementary school he began to express a strong inquisitiveness about nature. Sagan recalled taking his first trips to the [[public library]] alone, at the age of five, when his mother got him a library card. He wanted to learn what stars were, since none of his friends or their parents could give him a clear answer:
{{quote|I went to the librarian and asked for a book about stars;... And the answer was stunning. It was that the Sun was a star but really close. The stars were suns, but so far away they were just little points of light&amp;nbsp;... The scale of the universe suddenly opened up to me. It was a kind of religious experience. There was a magnificence to it, a grandeur, a scale which has never left me. Never ever left me.&lt;ref name="Davidson" /&gt;{{rp|18}}}}

At about age six or seven, he and a close friend took trips to the [[American Museum of Natural History]] across the East River in [[Manhattan]]. While there, they went to the [[Hayden Planetarium]] and walked around the museum's exhibits of [[outer space|space]] objects, such as [[meteorite]]s, and displays of dinosaurs and animals in natural settings. Sagan writes about those visits:
{{quote|I was transfixed by the dioramas—lifelike representations of animals and their habitats all over the world. Penguins on the dimly lit Antarctic ice;&amp;nbsp;...a family of [[gorilla]]s, the male beating his chest,&amp;nbsp;...an American [[grizzly bear]] standing on his hind legs, ten or twelve feet tall, and staring me right in the eye.&lt;ref name="Davidson" /&gt;{{rp|18}}}}

His parents helped nurture his growing interest in science by buying him chemistry sets and reading materials. His interest in space, however, was his primary focus, especially after reading science fiction stories by writers such as [[H. G. Wells]] and [[Edgar Rice Burroughs]], which stirred his imagination about life on other planets such as [[Mars]]. According to biographer Ray Spangenburg, these early years as Sagan tried to understand the mysteries of the planets became a "driving force in his life, a continual spark to his intellect, and a quest that would never be forgotten."&lt;ref name="Spangenburg" /&gt;

In 1947 he discovered ''[[Astounding Science Fiction]]'' magazine, which introduced him to more [[hard science fiction]] speculations than those in Burroughs's novels. That same year inaugurated the "[[flying saucer]]" [[mass hysteria]] with the young Carl suspecting the "discs" might be alien spaceships.&lt;ref name="anb.org"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.anb.org/articles/13/13-02612-print.html |title=American National Biography Online, Carl Sagan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== High school years ===
Sagan had lived in Bensonhurst where he went to David A. Boody Junior High School. He had his [[bar mitzvah]] in Bensonhurst when he turned 13.&lt;ref name="Davidson" /&gt;{{rp|23}} The following year, 1948, his family moved to the nearby town of [[Rahway, New Jersey]] for his father's work, where Sagan then entered [[Rahway High School]]. He graduated in 1951.&lt;ref name="Davidson" /&gt;{{rp|23}} Rahway was an older industrial town, and the Sagans were among its few Jewish families.&lt;ref name="Davidson" /&gt;{{rp|23}}

[[File:Carl Sagan 1951.png|thumb|right|Photo of Sagan from high school yearbook, 1951]]
Sagan was a straight-A student but was bored due to unchallenging classes and uninspiring teachers.&lt;ref name="Davidson" /&gt;{{rp|23}} His teachers realized this and tried to convince his parents to send him to a private school, the administrator telling them, "This kid ought to go to a school for gifted children, he has something really remarkable."&lt;ref name="Davidson" /&gt;{{rp|24}} This they couldn't do, partly because of the cost.

Sagan was made president of the school's chemistry club, and at home he set up his own laboratory. He taught himself about molecules by making cardboard cutouts to help him visualize how [[molecules]] were formed: "I found that about as interesting as doing [chemical] experiments," he said.&lt;ref name="Davidson" /&gt;{{rp|24}} Sagan remained mostly interested in astronomy as a hobby, and in his junior year made it a career goal after he learned that astronomers were paid for doing what he always enjoyed: "That was a splendid day&amp;shy;&amp;shy;&amp;shy;&amp;shy;—when I began to suspect that if I tried hard I could do astronomy full-time, not just part-time."&lt;ref name="Davidson"/&gt;{{rp|25}}

Before the end of high school, he entered an essay contest in which he posed the question of whether human contact with advanced life forms from another planet might be as disastrous for people on Earth as it was for Native Americans when they first had contact with Europeans.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;[[#Poundstone|Poundstone 1999]], p. 15&lt;/ref&gt; The subject was considered controversial, but his rhetorical skill won over the judges and they awarded him first prize.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; By graduation, his classmates had voted him "Most likely to succeed," and put him in line to be valedictorian.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

=== University education ===
Sagan attended the [[University of Chicago]], which was one of the few colleges he applied to that would consider admitting a sixteen-year-old, despite his excellent high school grades. Its Chancellor, Robert Hutchins, structured the school as an "ideal meritocracy," with no age requirement.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;[[#Poundstone|Poundstone 1999]], p. 14&lt;/ref&gt; The school also employed a number of the nation's leading scientists, including [[Enrico Fermi]] and [[Edward Teller]], along with operating the famous [[Yerkes Observatory]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;

During his time as an honors program [[Undergraduate education|undergraduate]], Sagan worked in the laboratory of the [[geneticist]] [[Hermann Joseph Muller|H. J.

==Career and research ==
[[File:Who's Out There (1973).ogv|thumb|250px|thumbtime=4:45|Sagan is one of those discussing the likelihood of [[extraterrestrial life|life on other planets]] in ''[[c:File:Who's Out There (1973).ogv|Who's Out There?]]'' (1973), an [[CINE|award-winning]] [[NASA]] documentary film by [[Robert Drew]].]]

From 1960 to 1962 Sagan was a [[Miller Research Fellows|Miller Fellow]] at the [[University of California, Berkeley]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sciencereview.berkeley.edu/happy-belated-birthday-carl/ |title=Happy (Belated) Birthday Carl! |publisher=[[University of California, Berkeley]] The Berkeley Science Review |accessdate=December 1, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Meanwhile, he published an article in 1961 in the journal ''Science'' on the atmosphere of Venus, while also working with NASA's [[Mariner 2]] team, and served as a "Planetary Sciences Consultant" to the [[RAND Corporation]].&lt;ref name="Carl Sagan:A life"&gt;{{cite book |title=Carl Sagan:A life  |first1=Keay|last1=Davidson |publisher= John Wiley &amp; Sons |year=1999 |isbn=0-471-25286-7 |page=138 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the publication of Sagan's ''Science'' article, in 1961 [[Harvard University]] astronomers [[Fred Whipple]] and [[Donald Menzel]] offered Sagan the opportunity to give a colloquium at Harvard, and they subsequently offered him a [[Academic ranks in the United States|lecturer]] position at the institution.  Sagan instead asked to be made an [[assistant professor]], and eventually Whipple and Menzel were able to convince Harvard to offer Sagan the assistant professor position he requested.&lt;ref name="Carl Sagan:A life"/&gt; Sagan lectured, performed research, and advised graduate students at the institution from 1963 until 1968, as well as working at the [[Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory]], also located in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]].

In 1968, Sagan was denied [[Tenure (academic)|tenure]] at Harvard. He later indicated the decision was very much unexpected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Carl Sagan:A life  |first1=Keay|last1=Davidson |publisher= John Wiley &amp; Sons |year=1999 |isbn=0-471-25286-7 |page=204 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The tenure denial has been blamed on several factors, including that he focused his interests too broadly across a number of areas (while the norm in academia is to become a renowned expert in a narrow specialty), and perhaps because of his well-publicized scientific advocacy, which some scientists perceived as borrowing the ideas of others for little more than self-promotion.&lt;ref name="morrison"/&gt; An advisor from his years as an undergraduate student, Harold Urey, wrote a letter to the tenure committee recommending strongly against tenure for Sagan.&lt;ref name="anb.org"/&gt;

Long before the ill-fated tenure process, [[Cornell University]] astronomer [[Thomas Gold]] had courted Sagan to move to [[Ithaca, New York]] and join the faculty at Cornell. Following the denial of tenure from Harvard, Sagan accepted Gold's offer and remained a faculty member at Cornell for nearly 30 years until his death in 1996. Unlike Harvard, the smaller and more laid-back astronomy department at Cornell welcomed Sagan's growing celebrity status.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Carl Sagan:A life  |first1=Keay|last1=Davidson |publisher= John Wiley &amp; Sons |year=1999 |isbn=0-471-25286-7 |page=213 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Following two years as an associate professor, Sagan became a [[Professor|full professor]] at Cornell in 1970, and directed the Laboratory for [[Planetary science|Planetary Studies]] there. From 1972 to 1981, he was associate director of the Center for Radiophysics and Space Research (CRSR) at Cornell. In 1976, he became the David Duncan Professor of Astronomy and Space Sciences, a position he held for the remainder of his life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Conversations with Carl Sagan |edition=illustrated |first1=Carl |last1=Sagan |first2=Tom |last2=Head |publisher=Univ.

Sagan was associated with the U.S. space program from its inception. From the 1950s onward, he worked as an advisor to [[NASA]], where one of his duties included briefing the [[Apollo program|Apollo]] [[astronaut]]s before their flights to the [[Moon]]. Sagan contributed to many of the [[robotic spacecraft]] missions that explored the [[Solar System]], arranging experiments on many of the expeditions. Sagan assembled the first physical message that was sent into space: a [[gold]]-[[anodized]] [[Pioneer plaque|plaque]], attached to the space probe ''[[Pioneer&amp;nbsp;10]]'', launched in 1972. ''[[Pioneer&amp;nbsp;11]]'', also carrying another copy of the plaque, was launched the following year. He continued to refine his designs; the most elaborate message he helped to develop and assemble was the [[Voyager Golden Record]] that was sent out with the [[Voyager program|Voyager]] space probes in 1977. Sagan often challenged the decisions to fund the [[Space Shuttle]] and the [[International Space Station]] at the expense of further robotic missions.&lt;ref name="CharlieRose"&gt;{{cite interview |last=Sagan |first=Carl |title=An Interview with Carl Sagan |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soF-aS169bw |work=''[[Charlie Rose (TV series)|Charlie Rose]]'' |publisher=[[PBS]] |location=New York |date=January 5, 1995 |accessdate=August 30, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Scientific achievements ===
Former student [[David Morrison (astrophysicist)|David Morrison]] describes Sagan as "an 'idea person' and a master of intuitive physical arguments and '[[Back-of-the-envelope calculation|back of the envelope]]' calculations,"&lt;ref name="morrison" /&gt; and [[Gerard Kuiper]] said that "Some persons work best in specializing on a major program in the laboratory; others are best in liaison between sciences. Dr. Sagan belongs in the latter group."&lt;ref name="morrison" /&gt;

Sagan's contributions were central to the discovery of the high surface temperatures of the planet [[Venus]].&lt;ref name=surftemp /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Principles of Planetary Climate |edition= |first1=Raymond T. |last1=Pierrehumbert |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=2010 |isbn=978-1-139-49506-6 |page=202 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bO_U8f5pVR8C}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=bO_U8f5pVR8C&amp;pg=PA202 Extract of page 202]&lt;/ref&gt; In the early 1960s no one knew for certain the basic conditions of Venus' surface, and Sagan listed the possibilities in a report later depicted for popularization in a [[Time Life]] book, ''Planets''. His own view was that Venus was dry and very hot as opposed to the balmy paradise others had imagined. He had investigated [[radio wave]]s from Venus and concluded that there was a surface temperature of {{convert|500|°C|-2}}. As a visiting scientist to NASA's [[Jet Propulsion Laboratory]], he contributed to the first [[Mariner program|Mariner]] missions to Venus, working on the design and management of the project. [[Mariner 2]] confirmed his conclusions on the surface conditions of Venus in 1962.

Sagan was among{{clarify|date=October 2014}} the first to hypothesize that [[Saturn]]'s moon [[Titan (moon)|Titan]] might possess oceans of liquid compounds on its surface and that [[Jupiter]]'s moon [[Europa (moon)|Europa]] might possess subsurface oceans of water. This would make Europa potentially habitable.&lt;ref&gt;Much of Sagan's research in the field of planetary science is outlined by [[William Poundstone]]. Poundstone's biography of Sagan includes an 8-page list of Sagan's scientific articles published from 1957 to 1998. Detailed information about Sagan's scientific work comes from the primary research articles. Example: {{cite journal |last1=Sagan |first1=C. |last2=Thompson |first2=W.R. |last3=Khare |first3=B.N. |year=1992 |title=Titan: A Laboratory for Prebiological Organic Chemistry |journal=[[Accounts of Chemical Research]] |volume=25 |issue=7 |pages=286–292 |location=Washington, D.C. |publisher=[[American Chemical Society]] |doi=10.1021/ar00019a003}} There is commentary on this research article about Titan at [[David J. Darling]]'s [http://www.daviddarling.info/encyclopedia/T/Titanprebiotic.html ''The Encyclopedia of Science''].&lt;/ref&gt; Europa's subsurface ocean of water was later indirectly confirmed by the spacecraft ''[[Galileo (spacecraft)|Galileo]]''. The mystery of Titan's reddish haze was also solved with Sagan's help. The reddish haze was revealed to be due to complex [[Organic compound|organic molecules]] constantly raining down onto Titan's surface.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Pafumi |first=G.R. |title=Is Our Vision of God Obsolete?: Often What We Believe is not What We Observe |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ySNfuGKwfMcC&amp;pg=PA338|accessdate=August 30, 2013 |year=2010 |publisher=[[Xlibris]] |location=Bloomington, IN |isbn=978-1-4415-9041-1 |oclc=710798384 |page=338}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Self-published inline|certain=yes|date=December 2017}}

He further contributed insights regarding the atmospheres of Venus and [[Jupiter]] as well as seasonal changes on [[Mars]]. He also perceived [[global warming]] as a growing, man-made danger and likened it to the natural development of Venus into a hot, life-hostile planet through a kind of [[runaway greenhouse effect]].&lt;ref name="cosmos_book"&gt;{{cite book |last=Sagan |first=Carl |title=[[Cosmos (Carl Sagan book)|Cosmos]] |edition=1st Ballantine Books |origyear=Originally published 1980 |year=1985 |publisher=Ballantine Books |location=New York |isbn=0-345-33135-4 |oclc=12814276 |lccn=80005286 |ref=Sagan 1980 (1985 ed.)}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sagan and his Cornell colleague [[Edwin Ernest Salpeter]] speculated about [[Jupiter#Possibility of life|life in Jupiter's clouds]], given the planet's dense atmospheric composition rich in organic molecules. He studied the observed color variations on Mars' surface and concluded that they were not seasonal or vegetational changes as most believed{{clarify|date=October 2014}} but shifts in surface dust caused by [[dust storm#Extraterrestrial dust storms|windstorms]].

Sagan is also known for his research on the possibilities of [[Astrobiology|extraterrestrial life]], including experimental demonstration of the production of [[amino acid]]s from basic chemicals by [[radiation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |encyclopedia=[[Columbia Encyclopedia]] |title=Sagan, Carl Edward |url=http://www.bartelby.com/65/sa/Sagan-Ca.html |accessdate=August 30, 2013 |edition=Sixth |date=May 2001 |publisher=[[Columbia University Press]] |location=New York |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071011220013/http://bartelby.com/65/sa/Sagan-Ca.html |archivedate=October 11, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ATP Synthesized"&gt;{{cite news|last1=No Writer Attributed|title=Sagan Synthesizes ATP In Laboratory|url=http://www.thecrimson.com/article/1963/8/21/sagan-synthesizes-atp-in-laboratory-plaboratory/|accessdate=2015-09-12|work=The Harvard Crimson|date=1963-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Cosmos'': popularizing science on TV===
[[File:Carl Sagan - 1980.jpg|thumb|Sagan in ''Cosmos'' (1980)]]
In 1980 Sagan co-wrote and narrated the award-winning 13-part [[PBS]] television series, ''[[Cosmos: A Personal Voyage]],'' which became the most widely watched series in the history of American public television. The show has been seen by at least 500 million people across 60 different countries.&lt;ref name=Starchild /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mnsu.edu/emuseum/information/biography/pqrst/sagan_carl.html |title=Carl Sagan |work=EMuseum |publisher=[[Minnesota State University, Mankato]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100528213538/http://www.mnsu.edu/emuseum/information/biography/pqrst/sagan_carl.html |archivedate=May 28, 2010 |accessdate=August 30, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cosmolearning.com/documentaries/cosmos/ |title=CosmoLearning Astronomy |publisher=CosmoLearning |accessdate=October 8, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book, ''Cosmos'', written by Sagan, was published to accompany the series.&lt;ref name="NationalGeo"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2014/03/140316-carl-sagan-science-galaxies-space/ |title=Who Was Carl Sagan? |last=Vergano |first=Dan |date=March 16, 2014 |website=National Geographic Daily News |publisher=[[National Geographic Society]] |location=Washington, D.C. |accessdate=May 13, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of his earlier popularity as a science writer from his best-selling books, including ''The Dragons of Eden'', which won him a Pulitzer Prize in 1977, he was asked to write and narrate the show. It was targeted to a general audience of viewers who Sagan felt had lost interest in science, partly due to a stifled educational system.&lt;ref name=Browne&gt;Browne, Ray Broadus. ''The Guide to United States Popular Culture'', ''Popular Press'' (2001) p. 704&lt;/ref&gt;

Each of the 13 episodes was created to focus on a particular subject or person, thereby demonstrating the synergy of the universe.&lt;ref name=Browne/&gt; They covered a wide range of scientific subjects including the [[Abiogenesis|origin of life]] and a perspective of humans' place on Earth.

The show won an [[Emmy Award|Emmy]]&lt;ref name="cosmosemmy"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.emmys.com/shows/cosmos |title=Cosmos |publisher=[[Academy of Television Arts &amp; Sciences]] |accessdate=September 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; along with a [[Peabody Award]], and transformed Sagan from an obscure astronomer into a pop-culture icon.&lt;ref&gt;''Popular Science'', Oct. 2005, p. 90&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine ran a cover story about Sagan soon after the show broadcast, referring to him as "creator, chief writer and host-narrator of the show.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Golden |first=Frederic |date=October 20, 1980 |title=The Cosmic Explainer |journal=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |accessdate=August 30, 2013 |url=http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,951539,00.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2000, "Cosmos" was released on a remastered set of DVDs.

=== Scientific and critical thinking advocacy ===

Sagan's ability to convey his ideas allowed many people to understand the cosmos better—simultaneously emphasizing the value and worthiness of the human race, and the relative insignificance of the Earth in comparison to the [[Universe]]. He delivered the 1977 series of [[Royal Institution Christmas Lectures]] in London.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://richannel.org/christmas-lectures/1977/1977-carl-sagan |title=Christmas Lectures 1977: The Planets : Ri Channel |work=Ri Channel |publisher=[[Royal Institution|Royal Institution of Great Britain]] |location=London |accessdate=February 7, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sagan was a proponent of the search for extraterrestrial life. He urged the scientific community to listen with [[radio telescope]]s for signals from potential intelligent [[Extraterrestrial life#Indirect search|extraterrestrial life-forms]]. Sagan was so persuasive that by 1982 he was able to get a petition advocating SETI published in the journal ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'', signed by 70 scientists, including seven [[Nobel Prize]] winners. This signaled a tremendous increase in the respectability of a then-controversial field. Sagan also helped [[Frank Drake]] write the [[Arecibo message]], a radio message beamed into space from the [[Arecibo Observatory|Arecibo radio telescope]] on November 16, 1974, aimed at informing potential extraterrestrials about Earth.

Sagan was chief technology officer of the professional planetary research journal ''[[Icarus (journal)|Icarus]]'' for twelve years. He co-founded [[The Planetary Society]], and was a member of the [[SETI Institute]] Board of Trustees. Sagan served as Chairman of the Division for Planetary Science of the [[American Astronomical Society]], as President of the Planetology Section of the [[American Geophysical Union]], and as Chairman of the Astronomy Section of the [[American Association for the Advancement of Science]] (AAAS).

At the height of the [[Cold War]], Sagan became involved in [[nuclear disarmament]] efforts  by promoting hypotheses on the effects of [[nuclear warfare|nuclear war]], when [[Paul Crutzen]]'s [[Nuclear winter#1982|"Twilight at Noon"]] concept suggested that a substantial nuclear exchange could trigger a [[Nuclear winter#1982|nuclear twilight]] and upset the delicate balance of life on Earth by cooling the surface. In 1983 he was one of five authors—the "S"—in the follow-up [[Nuclear winter#1983|"TTAPS"]] model (as the research paper came to be known), which contained the first use of the term "[[nuclear winter]]", which his colleague [[Richard P. Turco]] had coined.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Turco |first1=R.P. |authorlink1=Richard P.

Carl Sagan discussed his involvement in the political nuclear winter debates and his erroneous global cooling prediction for the Gulf War fires in his book, ''[[The Demon-Haunted World]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1984 he co-authored the book ''[[The Cold and the Dark: The World after Nuclear War]]'' and in 1990 he co-authored the book ''A Path Where No Man Thought: Nuclear Winter and the End of the Arms Race'',  which explains the nuclear winter hypothesis and advocates [[nuclear disarmament]]. Sagan received a great deal of skepticism and disdain for the use of media to disseminate a very uncertain hypothesis. In personal correspondence with [[Edward Teller]] c. 1983, although beginning amicably, with Teller expressing support for continued research to ascertain the credibility of the winter hypothesis, Sagan and Teller's correspondence would ultimately result in Teller writing "A propagandist is one who uses incomplete information to produce maximum persuasion. I  can compliment you on being, indeed, an excellent propagandist remembering that a propagandist is the better the less he appears to be one".&lt;ref name="rubinsonp66913"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.lib.utexas.edu/etd/d/2008/rubinsonp66913/rubinsonp66913.pdf|title=The U.S. National Security State and Scientists'Challenge to Nuclear Weapons during the Cold War.

Sagan also wrote books to popularize science, such as ''Cosmos'', which reflected and expanded upon some of the themes of ''A Personal Voyage'' and became the best-selling science book ever published in English;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://science.discovery.com/convergence/cosmos/bio/bio.html?clik=fsmain_feat3 |title=Meet Carl Sagan |work=[[Science (TV network)|The Science Channel]] |publisher=[[Discovery Communications]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070518042909/http://science.discovery.com/convergence/cosmos/bio/bio.html?clik=fsmain_feat3 |archivedate=May 18, 2007 |accessdate=August 31, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Dragons of Eden|The Dragons of Eden: Speculations on the Evolution of Human Intelligence]]'', which won a [[Pulitzer Prize]]; and ''[[Broca's Brain (book)|Broca's Brain: Reflections on the Romance of Science]]''. Sagan also wrote the best-selling science fiction novel ''Contact'' in 1985, based on a [[film treatment]] he wrote with his wife in 1979, but he did not live to see the book's 1997 [[Contact (1997 American film)|motion picture adaptation]], which starred [[Jodie Foster]] and won the 1998 [[Hugo Award]] for Best Dramatic Presentation.

Sagan wrote a sequel to ''Cosmos'', ''[[Pale Blue Dot (book)|Pale Blue Dot: A Vision of the Human Future in Space]]'', which was selected as a notable book of 1995 by ''[[The New York Times]]''. He appeared on PBS's ''[[Charlie Rose (TV series)|Charlie Rose]]'' program in January 1995.&lt;ref name="CharlieRose" /&gt; Sagan also wrote the introduction for [[Stephen Hawking]]'s bestseller, ''[[A Brief History of Time]]''. Sagan was also known for his popularization of science, his efforts to increase scientific understanding among the general public, and his positions in favor of [[scientific skepticism]] and against [[pseudoscience]], such as his [[Debunker|debunking]] of the [[Betty and Barney Hill abduction]]. To mark the tenth anniversary of Sagan's death, [[David Morrison (astrophysicist)|David Morrison]], a former student of Sagan's, recalled "Sagan's immense contributions to planetary research, the public understanding of science, and the skeptical movement" in ''[[Skeptical Inquirer]]''.&lt;ref name="morrison" /&gt;

Following [[Saddam Hussein]]'s threats to light [[Kuwait]]'s oil wells on fire in response to any physical challenge to [[Iraq]]i control of the oil assets, Sagan together with his "TTAPS" colleagues and [[Paul Crutzen]], warned in January 1991 in the ''[[Baltimore Sun]]'' and ''[[Wilmington Morning Star]]'' newspapers that if the fires were left to burn over a period of several months, enough smoke from the 600 or so 1991 [[Kuwaiti oil fires]] "might get so high as to disrupt agriculture in much of South Asia&amp;nbsp;..." and that this possibility should "affect the war plans";&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://articles.baltimoresun.com/1991-01-23/news/1991023131_1_kuwait-saddam-hussein-sagan |title=PAGE 1 OF 2: Burning oil wells could be disaster, Sagan says January 23, 1991}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=6tEVAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=RBQEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6851,2148654&amp;dq=world-climate-conference+oil+fires ''Wilmington morning Star''] January 21'st, 1991&lt;/ref&gt; these claims were also the subject of a televised debate between Sagan and physicist [[Fred Singer]] on 22 January, aired on the [[ABC News]] program ''[[Nightline (US news program)|Nightline]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/4960296/The-Kuwaiti-Oli-Fires|title=The Kuwaiti Oil Fires|author=Hirschmann, Kris|publisher=Facts on File.|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140102193647/http://www.scribd.com/doc/4960296/The-Kuwaiti-Oli-Fires|archivedate=January 2, 2014|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--The reference for this is a hardcopy transcript of the episode, excerpts on the Fred Singer talk page.--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode| title = FIRST ISRAELI SCUD FATALITIES OIL FIRES IN KUWAIT| series = Nightline| serieslink = Nightline (US news program)| network = ABC| airdate = 1991-01-22| transcript = yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:F-14A VF-114 over burning Kuwaiti oil well 1991.JPEG|thumb|left|Sagan admitted he had overestimated the danger posed by the 1991 [[Kuwaiti oil fires]].]] In the televised debate, Sagan argued that the effects of the smoke would be similar to the effects of a [[nuclear winter]], with Singer arguing to the contrary. After the debate, the fires burnt for many months before extinguishing efforts were complete. The results of the smoke did not produce continental-sized cooling. Sagan later conceded in ''The Demon-Haunted World'' that the prediction did not turn out to be correct: "it ''was'' pitch black at noon and temperatures dropped 4°–6° C over the [[Persian Gulf]], but not much smoke reached stratospheric altitudes and Asia was spared".&lt;ref&gt;[[#Sagan 1995|Sagan 1995]], p. 257&lt;/ref&gt;

In his later years Sagan advocated the creation of an organized search for asteroids/[[near-Earth object]]s (NEOs) that might impact the Earth but to forestall or postpone developing the technological methods that would be needed to defend against them.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Head|Head 2006]], p. 86–87&lt;/ref&gt; He argued that all of the numerous methods proposed to [[asteroid impact avoidance|alter the orbit of an asteroid]], including the employment of [[nuclear weapon design|nuclear detonation]]s, created a [[Asteroid impact avoidance#Deflection technology concerns|Deflection Dilemma]]: if the ability to deflect an asteroid away from the Earth exists, then one would also have the ability to divert a non-threatening object towards Earth, creating an immensely destructive weapon.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Sagan |first1=Carl |last2=Ostro |first2=Steven J. |authorlink2=Steven J.

Sagan remained hopeful that the natural NEO impact threat, and the intrinsically double-edged essence of the methods to prevent these threats, would serve as a "new and potent motivation to maturing international relations".&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite podcast |url=http://www.astrosociety.org/silicon-valley-astronomy-lectures/taking-a-hit-asteroid-impacts-and-evolution/ |title=Taking a Hit: Asteroid Impacts &amp; Evolution |website=Astronomical Society of the Pacific |publisher=[[Astronomical Society of the Pacific]] |last=Morrison |first=David|authorlink=David Morrison (astrophysicist) |date=October 3, 2007 |accessdate=August 31, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later acknowledging that, with sufficient international oversight, in the future a "work our way up" approach to implementing nuclear explosive deflection methods could be fielded, and when sufficient knowledge was gained, to use them to aid in [[mining asteroids]].&lt;ref name="e-reading.club"/&gt;  His interest in the use of nuclear detonations in space grew out of his work in 1958 for the [[Armour Research Foundation]]'s [[Project A119]], concerning the possibility of detonating a nuclear device on the lunar surface.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://medium.com/war-is-boring/3516ac20ae1e |title=When Earth Dreamed of Nuking the Moon |last1=Gault |first1=Matthew |date=28 November 2013 |website=medium.com |publisher=War is Boring |accessdate=28 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sagan was a critic of [[Plato]], having said of the ancient Greek philosopher: "Science and mathematics were to be removed from the hands of the merchants and the artisans. This tendency found its most effective advocate in a follower of [[Pythagoras]] named Plato" and &lt;blockquote&gt;He (Plato) believed that [[Theory of Forms|ideas were far more real than the natural world]]. He advised the astronomers not to waste their time observing the stars and planets. It was better, he believed, just to think about them. Plato expressed hostility to observation and experiment. He taught contempt for the real world and disdain for the practical application of scientific knowledge. Plato's followers succeeded in extinguishing the light of science and experiment that had been kindled by [[Democritus]] and the [[Ionian School (philosophy)|other Ionians]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode |title=The Backbone of Night |series=[[Cosmos: A Personal Voyage]] |first=Carl (writer/host) |last=Sagan |network=PBS |airdate=November 9, 1980 |number=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Popularizing science ===
Speaking about his activities in popularizing science, Sagan said that there were at least two reasons for scientists to share the purposes of science and its contemporary state. Simple self-interest was one: much of the funding for science came from the public, and the public therefore had the right to know how the money was being spent. If scientists increased public admiration for science, there was a good chance of having more public supporters.{{clarify|date=March 2016}} The other reason was the excitement of communicating one's own excitement about science to others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Carl Sagan, an Astronomer Who Excelled at Popularizing Science, Is Dead at 62 |first=William |last=Dicke |url=https://www.nytimes.com/learning/general/onthisday/bday/1109.html |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=December 21, 1996 |accessdate=August 31, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Criticisms===
While Sagan was widely adored by the general public, his reputation in the scientific community was more polarized.&lt;ref&gt;Davidson, p. 202&lt;/ref&gt; Critics sometimes characterized his work as fanciful, non-rigorous,  and self-aggrandizing,&lt;ref&gt;Davidson, p. 227&lt;/ref&gt; and others complained in his later years that he neglected his role as a faculty member to foster his celebrity status.&lt;ref&gt;Davidson, p. 341&lt;/ref&gt;

One of Sagan's harshest critics, [[Harold Urey]], felt that Sagan was getting too much publicity for a scientist and was treating some scientific theories too casually.&lt;ref name="Davidson, p. 203"&gt;Davidson, p. 203&lt;/ref&gt; Urey and Sagan were said to have different philosophies of science, according to Davidson. While Urey was an "old-time empiricist" who avoided theorizing about the unknown, Sagan was by contrast willing to speculate openly about such matters.&lt;ref&gt;Davidson, p. 204&lt;/ref&gt; [[Fred Whipple]] wanted Harvard to keep Sagan there, but learned that because Urey was a Nobel laureate, his opinion was an important factor in Harvard denying Sagan tenure.&lt;ref name="Davidson, p. 203"/&gt;

Sagan's Harvard friend [[Lester Grinspoon]] also stated, "I know Harvard well enough to know there are people there who certainly do not like people who are outspoken."&lt;ref name="Davidson, p. 203"/&gt; Grinspoon added:
{{quote|Wherever you turned, there was one astronomer being quoted on everything, one astronomer whose face you were seeing on TV, and one astronomer whose books had the preferred display slot at the local bookstore.&lt;ref name="Davidson, p. 203"/&gt;}}

Some, like Urey, later came to realize Sagan's popular brand of scientific advocacy was beneficial to the science as a whole.&lt;ref name="Davidson, p. 297"&gt;Davidson, p. 297&lt;/ref&gt; Urey especially liked Sagan's 1977 book, ''[[The Dragons of Eden]]'', and wrote Sagan with his opinion: "I like it very much and am amazed that someone like you has such an intimate knowledge of the various features of the problem...I congratulate you...You are a man of many talents."&lt;ref name="Davidson, p. 297"/&gt;

Sagan was accused of borrowing some ideas of others for his own benefit, and countered these claims by explaining that the misappropriation was an unfortunate side effect of his role as a science communicator and explainer, and that he attempted to give proper credit whenever possible.&lt;ref name="Davidson, p. 203"/&gt;

=== Social concerns ===
Sagan believed that the [[Drake equation]], on substitution of reasonable estimates, suggested that a large number of extraterrestrial civilizations would form, but that the lack of evidence of such civilizations highlighted by the [[Fermi paradox]] suggests [[Technology|technological]] civilizations tend to self-destruct. This stimulated his interest in identifying and publicizing ways that humanity could destroy itself, with the hope of avoiding such a [[Risks to civilization, humans, and planet Earth|cataclysm]] and eventually becoming a [[spacefaring]] species. Sagan's deep concern regarding the potential destruction of [[Risks to civilization, humans, and planet Earth|human civilization]] in a [[nuclear holocaust]] was conveyed in a memorable cinematic sequence in the final episode of ''Cosmos'', called "Who Speaks for Earth?" Sagan had already resigned{{date?}} from the [[United States Air Force Scientific Advisory Board|Air Force Scientific Advisory Board]]'s UFO investigating [[Condon Committee]] and voluntarily surrendered his [[Security clearance#Top Secret|top secret clearance]] in protest over the [[Vietnam War]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Druyan |first=Ann |authorlink=Ann Druyan |date=November 2000 |title=A New Sense of the Sacred Carl Sagan's 'Cosmic Connection' |journal=[[American Humanist Association|The Humanist]] |volume=60 |issue=6 |publisher=[[American Humanist Association]] |location=Washington, D.C. |accessdate=August 29, 2013 |url=https://www.questia.com/library/1G1-78889720/a-new-sense-of-the-sacred-carl-sagan-s-cosmic-connection}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following his marriage to his third wife ([[novelist]] Ann Druyan) in June 1981, Sagan became more politically active—particularly in opposing escalation of the [[nuclear arms race]] under [[President of the United States|President]] [[Ronald Reagan]].
[[File:US and USSR nuclear stockpiles.svg|thumb|The United States and [[Soviet Union]]/Russia nuclear stockpiles, in [[Historical nuclear weapons stockpiles and nuclear tests by country|total number of nuclear bombs/warheads in existence]] throughout the [[Cold War]] and post-Cold War era.]]
In March 1983, Reagan announced the [[Strategic Defense Initiative]]—a multibillion-dollar project to develop a comprehensive [[missile defense|defense]] against attack by [[Nuclear weapons delivery#Ballistic missile|nuclear missiles]], which was quickly dubbed the "Star Wars" program. Sagan spoke out against the project, arguing that it was technically impossible to develop a system with the level of perfection required, and far more expensive to build such a system than it would be for an enemy to defeat it through [[Decoy#Military decoy|decoy]]s and other means—and that its construction would seriously destabilize the "nuclear balance" between the United States and the [[Soviet Union]], making further progress toward [[nuclear disarmament]] impossible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVUk30GFsL4|title=YouTube|website=www.youtube.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When Soviet leader [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] declared a unilateral moratorium on the [[Nuclear weapons testing|testing of nuclear weapons]], which would begin on August 6, 1985—the 40th&amp;nbsp;anniversary of the [[Nuclear weapon#Fission weapons|atomic bomb]]ing of [[Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|Hiroshima]]—the Reagan administration dismissed the dramatic move as nothing more than propaganda, and refused to follow suit. In response, US [[Anti-nuclear movement|anti-nuclear]] and peace activists staged a series of protest actions at the [[Nevada National Security Site|Nevada Test Site]], beginning on [[Easter|Easter Sunday]] in 1986 and continuing through 1987. Hundreds of people in the "[[Nevada Desert Experience]]" group were arrested, including Sagan, who was arrested on two separate occasions as he climbed over a chain-link fence at the test site during the underground [[Operation Charioteer]] and [[Operation Musketeer (Nuclear test)|United States's Musketeer nuclear test series]] of detonations.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Spangenburg &amp; Moser|Spangenburg &amp; Moser 2004]], p. 106&lt;/ref&gt;

Sagan was also a vocal advocate of the controversial notion of [[testosterone poisoning]], arguing in 1992 that human males could become gripped by an "unusually severe [case of] testosterone poisoning" and this could compel them to become [[genocidal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Rethinking Risk and the Precautionary Principle |edition= |first1=Julian |last1=Morris |publisher=Butterworth-Heinemann |year=2000 |isbn=978-0-08-051623-3 |page=116 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XX6Us6SjLYkC}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=XX6Us6SjLYkC&amp;pg=PA116 Extract of page 116]&lt;/ref&gt; In his review of [[Moondance magazine]] writer [[Daniela Gioseffi]]'s 1990 book ''Women on War'', he argues that females are the only half of humanity "untainted by testosterone poisoning".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.italianamericanwriters.com/womenonwar.html Women On War], Daniela Gioseffi.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt; &lt;/nowiki&gt; One chapter of his 1993 book, ''[[Shadows of Forgotten Ancestors (book)|Shadows of Forgotten Ancestors]]'' is dedicated to testosterone and its alleged poisonous effects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Atheists in America |edition=reprinted |first1=Melanie E.|last1=Brewster |publisher=Columbia University Press |year=2014 |isbn=978-0-231-53700-1 |page=102 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iMjaAgAAQBAJ}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=iMjaAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA102 Extract of page 102]&lt;/ref&gt;

Sagan was married three times.  In 1957, he married biologist [[Lynn Margulis]]. The couple had two children, Jeremy and [[Dorion Sagan]]. After Carl Sagan and Margulis divorced, he married artist [[Linda Salzman Sagan|Linda Salzman]] in 1968 and they also had a child together, [[Nick Sagan]]. During these marriages, Carl Sagan focused heavily on his career, a factor which may have contributed to Sagan's first divorce.&lt;ref name="morrison" /&gt; In 1981, Sagan married author [[Ann Druyan]] and they later had two children, Alexandra and Samuel Sagan. Carl Sagan and Druyan remained married until his death in 1996. He lived in an [[900 Stewart Avenue (Ithaca, New York)|Egyptian revival house in Ithaca]] perched on the edge of a cliff that had formerly been the headquarters of a [[Cornell]] secret society.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://ezra.cornell.edu/posting.php?timestamp=1207807200 |dead-url=yes |title=Dear Uncle Ezra |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130606171745/http://ezra.cornell.edu/posting.php?timestamp=1207807200 |archive-date=2013-06-06 |access-date=2016-08-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Isaac Asimov]] described Sagan as one of only two people he ever met whose intellect surpassed his own. The other, he claimed, was the [[Computer science|computer scientist]] and [[artificial intelligence]] expert [[Marvin Minsky]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Asimov |first=Isaac |authorlink=Isaac Asimov |title=In Joy Still Felt: The Autobiography of Isaac Asimov, 1954–1978 |origyear=Originally published 1980; Garden City, NY: [[Doubleday (publisher)|Doubleday]] |year=1981 |publisher=[[Avon (publisher)|Avon]] |location=New York |isbn=0-380-53025-2 |oclc=7880716 |lccn=79003685 |pages=217, 302}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sagan wrote frequently about religion and the relationship between religion and science, expressing his skepticism about the conventional conceptualization of God as a sapient being. For example: &lt;blockquote&gt;Some people think God is an outsized, light-skinned male with a long white beard, sitting on a throne somewhere up there in the sky, busily tallying the fall of every sparrow. Others—for example [[Baruch Spinoza]] and [[Albert Einstein]]—considered God to be essentially the sum total of the physical laws which describe the universe. I do not know of any compelling evidence for anthropomorphic patriarchs controlling human destiny from some hidden celestial vantage point, but it would be madness to deny the existence of physical laws.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Sagan |first=Carl |title=[[Broca's Brain (book)|Broca's Brain: Reflections on the Romance of Science]] |edition=Reprint |origyear=Originally published 1979 |year=1980 |publisher=Ballantine Books |location=New York |isbn=0-345-33689-5 |oclc=428008204 |lccn=78021810 |page=330}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In another description of his view on the concept of God, Sagan emphatically wrote: &lt;blockquote&gt;The idea that God is an oversized white male with a flowing beard who sits in the sky and tallies the fall of every sparrow is ludicrous. But if by God one means the set of physical laws that govern the universe, then clearly there is such a God. This God is emotionally unsatisfying&amp;nbsp;... it does not make much sense to pray to the law of gravity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://atheism.about.com/library/quotes/bl_q_CSagan.htm |title=Quotes on Religion – Carl Sagan |website=Atheism.about.com |publisher=[[IAC (company)|IAC]] |accessdate=March 10, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

On [[atheism]], Sagan commented in 1981: &lt;blockquote&gt;An atheist is someone who is certain that God does not exist, someone who has compelling evidence against the existence of God. I know of no such compelling evidence. Because God can be relegated to remote times and places and to ultimate causes, we would have to know a great deal more about the universe than we do now to be sure that no such God exists. To be certain of the existence of God and to be certain of the nonexistence of God seem to me to be the confident extremes in a subject so riddled with doubt and uncertainty as to inspire very little confidence indeed.&lt;ref name="Sagan2006"&gt;[[#Head|Head 2006]], [https://books.google.com/books?id=gJ1rDj2nR3EC&amp;pg=PA70 p. 70]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Sagan also commented on Christianity and the [[Jefferson Bible]], stating "My long-time view about Christianity is that it represents an amalgam of two seemingly immiscible parts, the religion of Jesus and the religion of [[Paul the Apostle|Paul]]. [[Thomas Jefferson]] attempted to excise the Pauline parts of the New Testament. There wasn't much left when he was done, but it was an inspiring document."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Schei|first=Kenneth A.|title=An Atheist for Jesus|year=1996|publisher=Synthesis|isbn=0-926491-01-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Regarding spirituality and its relationship with science, Sagan stated: &lt;blockquote&gt;'Spirit' comes from the Latin word 'to breathe'. What we breathe is air, which is certainly matter, however thin. Despite usage to the contrary, there is no necessary implication in the word 'spiritual' that we are talking of anything other than matter (including the matter of which the brain is made), or anything
outside the realm of science. On occasion, I will feel free to use the word. Science is not only compatible with spirituality; it is a profound source of spirituality. When we recognize our place in an immensity of light-years and in the passage of ages, when we grasp the intricacy, beauty, and subtlety of life, then that soaring feeling, that sense of elation and humility combined, is surely spiritual.&lt;ref&gt;Sagan, Carl; Druyan, Ann (1997).

An environmental appeal, "Preserving and Cherishing the Earth", signed by Sagan with other noted scientists in January 1990, stated that "The historical record makes clear that religious teaching, example, and leadership are powerfully able to influence personal conduct and commitment... Thus, there is a vital role for religion and science."

In reply to a question in 1996 about his religious beliefs, Sagan answered, "I'm agnostic."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Head |first=Tom |year=1997 |title=Conversations with Carl | journal=Skeptic |volume=13 |issue=1 |pages=32–38 |publisher=The Skeptics Society}} Excerpted in [[#Head|Head 2006]]&lt;/ref&gt; Sagan maintained that the idea of a creator God of the Universe was difficult to prove or disprove and that the only conceivable scientific discovery that could challenge it would be an infinitely old universe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Sagan |first=Carl |title=[[The Demon-Haunted World|The Demon-Haunted World: Science as a Candle in the Dark]] |edition=1st Ballantine Books |origyear=Originally published 1995 |year=1997 |publisher=Ballantine Books |location=New York |isbn=0-345-40946-9 |oclc=36504316 |lccn=95034076 |page=278}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sagan's views on religion have been interpreted as a form of [[pantheism]] comparable to Einstein's belief in [[Spinozism|Spinoza's God]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Tracy |first=David |authorlink=David Tracy |editor1-last=Cobb |editor1-first=John B., Jr. |editor1-link=John B.

In 2006, Ann Druyan edited Sagan's 1985 Glasgow ''[[Gifford Lectures]] in Natural Theology'' into a book, ''[[The Varieties of Scientific Experience: A Personal View of the Search for God]]'', in which he elaborates on his views of divinity in the [[nature|natural world]].

Sagan is also widely regarded as a [[freethought|freethinker]] or [[skepticism|skeptic]]; one of his most famous quotations, in ''Cosmos'', was, "Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite episode | title= Encyclopaedia Galactica | series=Cosmos: A Personal Voyage |first=Carl (writer/host) |last=Sagan | network=PBS | airdate=December 14, 1980 | number=12 | minutes=01:24}}&lt;/ref&gt; (called the "[[Sagan standard]]" by some&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://lawsoflife.co.uk/sagans-standard/ | title= Sagan's Standard |last=Rawson |first=Hugh | work=The Unwritten Laws of Life | publisher= CSBC Ltd | year=2008 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120112045003/http://lawsoflife.co.uk/sagans-standard/ |archivedate=January 12, 2012 |accessdate=September 1, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;). This was based on a nearly identical statement by fellow founder of the [[Committee for Skeptical Inquiry|Committee for the Scientific Investigation of Claims of the Paranormal]], [[Marcello Truzzi]], "An extraordinary claim requires extraordinary proof."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Truzzi |first=Marcello |authorlink=Marcello Truzzi |title=On the Extraordinary: An Attempt at Clarification |year=1978 |journal=Zetetic Scholar |volume=1 |issue=1 |page=11 |format=PDF |url=http://www.tricksterbook.com/truzzi/ZS-Issues-PDFs/ZeteticScholarNo1.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Truzzi |first=Marcello |editor-last=Binkowski |editor-first=Edward |year=1998 |title=On Some Unfair Practices towards Claims of the Paranormal |journal=Oxymoron: Annual Thematic Anthology of the Arts and Sciences |volume= 2: The Fringe |publisher=Oxymoron Media, Inc. |location=New York |issn=1090-2236 |oclc=35240974 |accessdate=September 1, 2013 |url=http://www.skepticalinvestigations.org/Anomali/practices.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; This idea had been earlier aphorized in [[Théodore Flournoy]]'s work ''From India to the Planet Mars'' (1899) from a longer quote by [[Pierre-Simon Laplace]] (1749–1827), a French mathematician and astronomer, as the Principle of Laplace: "The weight of the evidence should be proportioned to the strangeness of the facts."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Flournoy |first=Théodore |authorlink=Théodore Flournoy |others=Introduction by Hélène Boursinhac; translation by Daniel B.

Late in his life, Sagan's books elaborated on his skeptical, [[naturalism (philosophy)|naturalistic]] view of the world. In ''The Demon-Haunted World'', he presented tools for testing arguments and detecting fallacious or fraudulent ones, essentially advocating wide use of critical thinking and the scientific method. The compilation ''Billions and Billions: Thoughts on Life and Death at the Brink of the Millennium'', published in 1997 after Sagan's death, contains essays written by Sagan, such as his views on abortion, and his widow Ann Druyan's account of his death as a skeptic, [[Agnosticism|agnostic]], and freethinker.

Sagan warned against humans' tendency towards [[anthropocentrism]]. He was the faculty adviser for the Cornell Students for the Ethical Treatment of Animals. In the ''Cosmos'' chapter "Blues For a Red Planet", Sagan wrote, "If there is life on Mars, I believe we should do nothing with Mars. Mars then belongs to the Martians, even if the Martians are only microbes."&lt;ref&gt;[[#Sagan 1980 (1985 ed.)|Sagan 1980 (1985 ed.)]], p. 108&lt;/ref&gt;

Sagan was a user and advocate of [[cannabis (drug)|marijuana]]. Under the pseudonym "Mr.&amp;nbsp;X", he contributed an essay about smoking cannabis to the 1971 book ''Marihuana Reconsidered''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Grinspoon |first=Lester |authorlink=Lester Grinspoon |others=New introduction by author |edition=2nd (reprint) |title=Marihuana Reconsidered |origyear=2nd ed. published 1977; Cambridge, MA: [[Harvard University Press]] |year=1994 |publisher=Quick American Archives |location=Oakland, CA |isbn=0-932551-13-0 |oclc=32410025 |lccn=77076767}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Mr. X | url=http://marijuana-uses.com/mr-x/ | publisher=Marijuana-Uses.com | author=Sagan, Carl | accessdate=August 7, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- NOTE: The book's title spells 'Marihuana' with an 'h' --&gt; The essay explained that marijuana use had helped to inspire some of Sagan's works and enhance sensual and intellectual experiences. After Sagan's death, his friend [[Lester Grinspoon]] disclosed this information to Sagan's biographer, Keay Davidson.

In 1994, engineers at [[Apple Inc.|Apple Computer]] code-named the [[Power Macintosh&amp;nbsp;7100]] "Carl Sagan" in the hope that Apple would make "billions and billions" with the sale of the PowerMac&amp;nbsp;7100.&lt;ref name=poundstone /&gt; The name was only used internally, but Sagan was concerned that it would become a product endorsement and sent Apple a cease-and-desist letter.

=== Sagan and UFOs ===
In 1947, the year that inaugurated the "[[flying saucer]]" [[fad|craze]], the young Sagan suspected the "discs" might be alien spaceships.&lt;ref name="anb.org"/&gt;

Sagan's interest in [[Unidentified flying object|UFO]] reports prompted him on August 3, 1952, to write a letter to U.S.&amp;nbsp;Secretary of State [[Dean Acheson]] to ask how the United States would respond if flying saucers turned out to be extraterrestrial.&lt;ref name="Davidson" /&gt;{{rp|51–52}} He later had several conversations on the subject in 1964 with [[Jacques Vallée]].&lt;ref name=westrum&gt;{{cite book |last=Westrum |first=Ron |authorlink=Ron Westrum |editor-last=Jacobs |editor-first=David M. |editor-link=David M.

[[Stuart Appelle]] notes that Sagan "wrote frequently on what he perceived as the [[logic]]al and [[empiricism|empirical]] [[fallacy|fallacies]] regarding UFOs and the [[Alien abduction|abduction experience]]. Sagan rejected an [[extraterrestrial hypothesis|extraterrestrial explanation]] for the phenomenon but felt there were both empirical and [[pedagogy|pedagogical]] benefits for examining UFO reports and that the subject was, therefore, a legitimate topic of study."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Appelle |first=Stuart |authorlink=Stuart Appelle |editor-last=Jacobs |editor-first=David M. |title=UFOs and Abductions: Challenging the Borders of Knowledge |year=2000 |publisher=University Press of Kansas |location=Lawrence, KS |pages=7–30 |chapter=Ufology and Academia: The UFO Phenomenon as a Scholarly Discipline |isbn=0-7006-1032-4 |oclc=43615835 |lccn=00028970}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1966 Sagan was a member of the Ad&amp;nbsp;Hoc Committee to Review [[Project Blue Book]], the [[United States Air Force|U.S.&amp;nbsp;Air Force]]'s UFO investigation project. The committee concluded Blue Book had been lacking as a scientific study, and recommended a university-based project to give the UFO phenomenon closer scientific scrutiny. The result was the [[Condon Committee]] (1966–68), led by physicist [[Edward Condon]], and in their final report they formally concluded that UFOs, regardless of what any of them actually were, did not behave in a manner consistent with a threat to national security.

Sociologist [[Ron Westrum]] writes that "The high point of Sagan's treatment of the UFO question was the [http://meetings.aaas.org/ AAAS' symposium] in 1969. A wide range of educated opinions on the subject were offered by participants, including not only proponents such as [[James E. McDonald|James McDonald]] and [[J.&amp;nbsp;Allen Hynek]] but also skeptics like astronomers [[William Kenneth Hartmann|William Hartmann]] and [[Donald Howard Menzel|Donald Menzel]]. The roster of speakers was balanced, and it is to Sagan's credit that this event was presented in spite of pressure from Edward Condon."&lt;ref name=westrum /&gt; With physicist Thornton Page, Sagan edited the lectures and discussions given at the symposium; these were published in 1972 as ''UFO's: A Scientific Debate''. Some of Sagan's many books examine UFOs (as did one episode of ''Cosmos'') and he claimed a religious undercurrent to the phenomenon.

Sagan again revealed his views on interstellar travel in his 1980 ''Cosmos'' series. In one of his last written works, Sagan argued that the chances of extraterrestrial spacecraft visiting Earth are vanishingly small. However, Sagan did think it plausible that Cold War concerns contributed to governments misleading their citizens about UFOs, and wrote that "some UFO reports and analyses, and perhaps voluminous files, have been made inaccessible to the public which pays the bills&amp;nbsp;... It's time for the files to be declassified and made generally available." He cautioned against jumping to conclusions about suppressed UFO data and stressed that there was no strong evidence that aliens were visiting the Earth either in the past or present.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Sagan 1995|Sagan 1995]], pp. 81–96, 99–104&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sagan's Paradox===

Sagan's contribution to the 1969 symposium was an attack on the belief that UFOs are piloted by extraterrestrial beings: Applying several logical assumptions (see [[Drake equation]]), Sagan calculated the possible number of advanced civilizations capable of interstellar travel to be about one million. He projected that any civilization wishing to check on all the others on a regular basis of, say, once a year would have to launch 10,000 spacecraft annually. Not only does that seem like an unreasonable number of launchings, but it would take all the material in one percent of the universe's stars to produce all the spaceships needed for all the civilizations to seek each other out.

To argue that the Earth was being chosen for regular visitations, Sagan said, one would have to assume that the planet is somehow unique. And that assumption "goes exactly against the idea that there are lots of civilizations around. Because if there are then our sort of civilization must be pretty common. And if we're not pretty common then there aren't going to be many civilizations advanced enough to send visitors."

This argument, which some called "Sagan's paradox," helped to establish a new school of thought: the belief that extraterrestrial life exists but has nothing to do with UFOs. The new belief had a salutary effect on UFO studies. It helped separate researchers who wanted to identify unidentified flying objects from those who wanted to identify their pilots. And it gave scientists opportunities to search the universe for intelligent life unencumbered by the stigma associated with UFOs.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/DavidJacobsTheUFOControversyInAmerica/Time-Life%20-%20Mysteries%20of%20the%20Unknown%20-%20The%20UFO%20Phenomenon_djvu.txt David Jacobs "The UFO Controversy In America" (1987), p.122-124]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Posthumous recognition ===
The 1997 movie ''[[Contact (1997 American film)|Contact]]'', based on Sagan's novel of the same name and finished after his death, ends with the dedication "For Carl". His photo can also be seen at 59:23 in the film.

In 1997 the [[Sagan Planet Walk]] was opened in Ithaca, New York. It is a walking-scale model of the Solar System, extending 1.2&amp;nbsp;km from the center of The Commons in downtown Ithaca to the [[Sciencenter]], a hands-on museum. The exhibition was created in memory of Carl Sagan, who was an Ithaca resident and Cornell Professor. Professor Sagan had been a founding member of the museum's advisory board.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sciencenter.org/saganpw/ |title=Sagan Planet Walk |website=sciencenter.org |publisher=[[Sciencenter]] |location=Ithaca, NY |accessdate=March 10, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130205135839/http://www.sciencenter.org/saganpw/ |archivedate=February 5, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The landing site of the unmanned ''[[Mars Pathfinder]]'' spacecraft was renamed the [[Mars Pathfinder#End of mission|Carl Sagan Memorial Station]] on July 5, 1997. Asteroid [[2709&amp;nbsp;Sagan]] is named in his honor, as is the [[Carl Sagan Institute]] for the search of habitable planets.

Sagan's son, Nick Sagan, wrote several episodes in the ''[[Star Trek]]'' franchise. In an episode of ''[[Star Trek: Enterprise]]'' entitled "[[Terra Prime]]", a quick shot is shown of the relic [[Rover (space exploration)|rover]] ''[[Mars Pathfinder#Sojourner rover|Sojourner]]'', part of the ''Mars Pathfinder'' mission, placed by a historical marker at [[Mars Pathfinder|Carl Sagan Memorial Station]] on the Martian surface. The marker displays a quote from Sagan: "Whatever the reason you're on Mars, I'm glad you're there, and I wish I was with you." Sagan's student [[Steve Squyres]] led the team that landed the rovers ''[[Spirit (rover)|Spirit]]'' and ''[[Opportunity (rover)|Opportunity]]'' successfully on Mars in 2004.

On November 9, 2001, on what would have been Sagan's 67th birthday, the [[Ames Research Center]] dedicated the site for the Carl Sagan Center for the Study of Life in the Cosmos. "Carl was an incredible visionary, and now his legacy can be preserved and advanced by a 21st&amp;nbsp;century research and education laboratory committed to enhancing our understanding of life in the universe and furthering the cause of space exploration for all time", said NASA Administrator [[Daniel Goldin]]. Ann Druyan was at the Center as it opened its doors on October 22, 2006.

Sagan has at least three awards named in his honor:
* The [[Carl Sagan Memorial Award]] presented jointly since 1997 by the American Astronomical Society and The Planetary Society,
* The [[Carl Sagan Medal]] for Excellence in Public Communication in Planetary Science presented since 1998 by the American Astronomical Society's [[Division for Planetary Sciences]] (AAS/DPS) for outstanding communication by an active planetary scientist to the general public—Carl Sagan was one of the original organizing committee members of the DPS, and
* The [[Carl Sagan Award for Public Understanding of Science]] presented by the [[Council of Scientific Society Presidents]] (CSSP)—Sagan was the first recipient of the CSSP award in 1993.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cssp.us/index.php?option=content&amp;task=view&amp;id=17&amp;Itemid=47 |title=Sagan Award for Public Understanding of Science |publisher=Council of Scientific Society Presidents |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070726075012/http://cssp.us/index.php?option=content&amp;task=view&amp;id=17&amp;Itemid=47 |archivedate=July 26, 2007 |accessdate=May 2, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

August 2007 the [[Independent Investigations Group]] (IIG) awarded Sagan posthumously a Lifetime Achievement Award. This honor has also been awarded to [[Harry Houdini]] and [[James Randi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iigwest.com/iigawards/2006/index.html |title=The 2007 IIG Awards |website=IIG |publisher=[[Independent Investigations Group]] |location=Los Angeles |date=August 18, 2007 |accessdate=July 1, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning in 2009, a musical project known as [[Symphony of Science]] sampled several excerpts of Sagan from his series ''Cosmos'' and remixed them to [[electronic music]]. To date, the videos have received over 21&amp;nbsp;million views worldwide on [[YouTube]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media |people=Boswell, John |date=November 9, 2009 |title=A Glorious Dawn |medium=[[Gramophone record#Common formats|7-in (17.5 cm) gramophone record]] |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSgiXGELjbc |accessdate=September 3, 2013 |publisher=[[Third Man Records]] |location=Nashville, TN}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2014 Swedish science fiction short film ''[[Wanderers (short film)|Wanderers]]'' uses excerpts of Sagan's narration of his book ''Pale Blue Dot'', played over digitally-created visuals of humanity's possible future expansion into outer space.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=D'Orazio |first=Dante |date=30 November 2014 |title=Wonderful short film imagines the day when we conquer the solar system |url=https://www.theverge.com/2014/11/30/7310433/wanderers-sci-fi-short-film-imagines-when-humans-conquer-the-solar-system |newspaper=The Verge |location= |access-date=19 February 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=David |first=Leonard |date=1 December 2014 |title=Epic Short Film 'Wanderers' Envisions Humanity's Future in Space |url=http://www.space.com/27895-wanderers-science-fiction-short-film.html |newspaper= |location=Space.com |access-date=21 February 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2015, the Finnish-based [[symphonic metal]] band [[Nightwish]] released the song "Sagan" as a non-album bonus track for their single "[[Élan (song)|Élan]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nightwish.com/en/news?page=2|title=Latest News - Nightwish – The Official Website|work=nightwish.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The song, written by the band's songwriter/composer/keyboardist [[Tuomas Holopainen]], is an homage to the life and work of the late Carl Sagan.

In August 2015, it was announced that a biopic of Sagan's life was being planned by [[Warner Bros.]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tracking-board.com/tb-exclusive-warner-bros-heads-to-the-cosmos-with-carl-sagan-biopic/ "WARNER BROS.

==Originally proposed as a "Bird Sanctuary"==
{{Expand section|More history|date=January 2011}}
The Gujarat State forest department had originally proposed that Chari Dhandh be declared as the "''Kutch bird sanctuary''" because its much bigger in size than the famous [[Bharatpur Bird Sanctuary]] in neighbouring state of [[Rajasthan]]. The Gujarat state Wildlife Board agreed to the demand on 26 June 2002, but later it was decided to accord Chari-Dhand wetland the status of a "''conservation forest''", as it would be of greater benefit to the local populace.&lt;ref name="Maheshwari-3" /&gt;

==Currently granted lower level protection as a "Protected or Reserve Forest"==
The wetland was originally spread over 22,700 hectares (227&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;), out of which 80&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;ref name="Maheshwari-1" /&gt; was the water filled area.&lt;ref name="Maheshwari-3" /&gt; Gujarat State Forest Department has accorded it the legal status of a ''"Protected or Reserve Forest"'' in 2008&lt;ref name="Maheshwari-3" /&gt; after 20 year lobbying by local conservationists.&lt;ref name="Maheshwari-1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="India's riches unprotected; BirdLife International &amp; Ramsar Convention on Wetlands"&gt;[http://www.birdlife.org/news/news/2008/07/indian_wetlands.html India's riches unprotected]; Credits: BNHS, RSPB; 25-07-2008; BirdLife International, Also posted on The [[Ramsar Convention on Wetlands]] of International Importance website [http://www.ramsar.org/cda/ramsar/display/main/main.jsp?zn=ramsar&amp;cp=1-26-45-85^16890_4000_0__]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Habitat and wildlife==
The abundance of water during the monsoons attracts birds to this one of India's unique wasteland. Thousands of flamingos in their mating plumage, Common cranes and other wetland birds including hundreds of Painted storks and Spoonbills among others can be spotted here.&lt;ref name="Maheshwari-3" /&gt; The wetland also attracts chinkara, wolves, caracal, desert cats and desert foxes besides endangered birds.&lt;ref name="Maheshwari-1" /&gt;

==Habitat improvement==
There are also efforts to replace alien invasive Gando Bawal thorn tree ''([[Prosopis juliflora]])'' with useful trees like Khara ''([[Salvadora oleoides]])'' and Mitha pilus ''([[Salvadora persica]])'' on the periphery of the Chari lake as part of the new conservation measures.&lt;ref name="Maheshwari-3" /&gt;

==Research and education==
[[Bombay Natural History Society]] (BNHS) had its field station at Chhari-Dhand in Banni grasslands from Jan 1990 to 1995 for the Bird Migration study project (S.A. Hussain) and grassland ecology project headed by Dr. Asad Rahmani. It now organizes ''Nature Education Camps'' here.&lt;ref name="Chhari-Dhand Conservation Reserve; Wetlands Forever website"/&gt;

==Proposed "Ramsar Convention site"==
Along with [[Banni Grasslands Reserve]] it is a proposed "[[List of Ramsar wetlands of international importance|Ramsar Convention site - Wetland of International importance]]" and listed on its website.&lt;ref name="Maheshwari-1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Maheshwari-2" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Maheshwari-3" /&gt;&lt;ref name="India's riches unprotected; BirdLife International &amp; Ramsar Convention on Wetlands"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://nspc.gujaratdesertecology.com/NSPC.GUIDE.Ecological.Sites.pdf Ecological Sites; NATIONAL SYMPOSIUM ON PROSOPIS: ECOLOGICAL, ECONOMIC SIGNIFICANCE AND MANAGEMENT CHALLENGES] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110711133207/http://nspc.gujaratdesertecology.com/NSPC.GUIDE.Ecological.Sites.pdf |date=11 July 2011 }}; 20–21 February 2009, Bhuj; URL: nspc.gujaratdesertecology.com {{cite web|url=http://nspc.gujaratdesertecology.com/NSPC.GUIDE.Ecological.Sites.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-02-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110711133207/http://nspc.gujaratdesertecology.com/NSPC.GUIDE.Ecological.Sites.pdf |archivedate=11 July 2011 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.birdlife.org/action/change/ramsar/ibas_ramsar_asia/11_India.pdf Ramsar designation of IBA lacking (159 IBAs); Important Bird Areas and potential Ramsar Sites in Asia – India] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090103223724/http://www.birdlife.org/action/change/ramsar/ibas_ramsar_asia/11_India.pdf# |date=3 January 2009 }}; 31 August 2005; birdlife.org&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="timesofindia.indiatimes.com"&gt;[http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2002-02-17/ahmedabad/27137251_1_nal-sarovar-ramsar-wetland-sites Ramsar site status sought for Nal Sarovar]; By Sajid Shaikh, TNN, 17 February 2002, Times of India&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="timesofindia.indiatimes.com"/&gt;

==Eco tourism development==
The district administration has chosen the Chari Dhandh wetland to create basic facilities for tourists.&lt;ref name="Maheshwari-2" /&gt; The Gujarat State forest department is preparing a project for Chari Dhandh development&lt;ref name="Maheshwari-2" /&gt; along with [[Dhinodhar hills]] in Nakhatrana taluka to make a circuit comprising Dhorado in interior Banni, Chari Dhandh and Dhinodhar to be a scenic route for nature lovers.&lt;ref name="Maheshwari-2" /&gt; As it is shallow water body, it could be used to promote boating providing employment to the local people, whose main activity has been restricted to fishing till now. There is also a suggestion to set up a Nature Interpretation Centre at the nearby Fulary village, the centre will provide knowledge of the wetland to the tourists.&lt;ref name="Maheshwari-3" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Basu-1"&gt;{{Cite news|author1=Basu, Debarati  |author2=Shukla, Shubhlakshmi|date=26 August 2008|title=[Gujarat] State thinks green, banks on eco-tourism|newspaper=[[The Indian Express]]|url=http://www.expressindia.com/latest-news/state-thinks-green-banks-on-ecotourism/353282/|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080912124021/http://www.expressindia.com/latest-news/State-thinks-green-banks-on-ecotourism/353282/|archivedate=12 September 2008|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3032">[[Image:Northwest-relief ChilcotinPlateau.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Location of the Chilcotin Plateau]]The '''Chilcotin Plateau''' is part of the [[Fraser Plateau]], a major subdivision of the [[Interior Plateau]] of [[British Columbia]].  The Chilcotin Plateau is physically near-identical with the region of the same name, i.e. [[Chilcotin District|"the Chilcotin"]], which lies between the [[Fraser River]] and the southern [[Coast Mountains]] and is defined by the basin of the [[Chilcotin River]] and so includes montane areas beyond the plateau.   East of the Chilcotin Plateau, across the [[Fraser River]], is the [[Cariboo Plateau]], while to the north beyond the [[West Road River|West Road (Blackwater) River]] is the [[Nechako Plateau]].  West and south of the Chilcotin Plateau are various subdivisions of the [[Coast Mountains]], including the [[Chilcotin Ranges]] which lie along the plateau's southwest.

Included within the definition of the Chilcotin Plateau are the [[Rainbow Range (Coast Mountains)|Rainbow Range]], near [[Bella Coola, British Columbia|Bella Coola]] and the similarly volcanic [[Ilgachuz Range]] and [[Itcha Range]] both of which are major [[shield volcano]]es. The [[Camelsfoot Range]], north of [[Lillooet, British Columbia|Lillooet]], is included in the Chilcotin Plateau by some systems of classification.

The plateau is nearly entirely drained by the [[Chilcotin River]] and its tributaries, the largest of which are the [[Chilanko River|Chilanko]] and [[Chilko River]]s.  Also draining the plateau on its eastern edge is [[Churn Creek]], which forms the east flank of the [[Camelsfoot Range]] and enters the [[Fraser River|Fraser]] directly.  On the west side of the plateau, the basins of the [[Dean River|Dean]], [[Homathko River|Homathko]] and [[Atnarko River]]s penetrate the massifs of the [[Coast Mountains]] and have their beginnings, or the early part of their courses, on the Chilcotin Plateau.

The Chilcotin Plateau consists of [[basalt]]ic [[lava]] of the [[Chilcotin Group]], a group of related [[volcanic rock]]s that is nearly parallel with the [[Fraser Plateau]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://dsp-psd.pwgsc.gc.ca/collection_2007/nrcan-rncan/M44-2007-A5E.pdf Chasm and Dog Creek lithofacies, Chilcotin Group basalt, Bonaparte Lake map area, British Columbia]&lt;/ref&gt; It extends along the adjacent [[Garibaldi Volcanic Belt]] in the [[Coast Mountains]]. Volcanism of the Chilcotin Plateau is considered to be a result of extension of the crust behind the coastal [[Cascadia subduction zone]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2806">The '''East Melanesian Islands''', also known as the Solomons-Vanuatu-Bismarck moist forests, is a biogeographic region in the [[Melanesia]] region of [[Oceania]].

It is notable for its unique flora and fauna and species richness. 

The region is designated a [[biodiversity hotspot]] by [[Conservation International]] (CI), and one of the outstanding [[Global 200|Global 200 ecoregions]] by the [[World Wide Fund for Nature]] (WWF). 

==Geography==
As defined by CI, the hotspot lies east and northeast of [[New Guinea]] and encompasses some 1,600 islands with a land area of nearly 100,000&amp;nbsp;km², including the [[Bismarck Archipelago]], [[Admiralty Islands]], [[Solomon Islands]], and the islands of [[Vanuatu]]. 

Politically, the hotspot includes parts of [[Papua New Guinea]] (the Bismarck Archipelago, Admiralty Islands, and [[Bougainville Island]]), and all of the Solomon Islands and Vanuatu.

The East Melanesian Islands have many plants and some animals whose ancestors arrived from neighboring [[New Guinea]] and [[New Caledonia]], but differ from those islands in that they were never joined to a [[continent]].

===Ecoregions===
This hotspot includes a number of [[ecoregion]]s that make up the northeastern portion of the [[Australasia ecozone]].
* [[Admiralty Islands lowland rain forests]] — ([[Papua New Guinea]])
*  New Britain-New Ireland lowland rain forests — ([[Papua New Guinea]])
*  New Britain-New Ireland montane rain forests — ([[Papua New Guinea]])
*  Solomon Islands rain forests — ([[Solomon Islands]],  [[Papua New Guinea]] including [[Bougainville Island]])
* [[Vanuatu rain forests]] — ([[Vanuatu]], [[Solomon Islands]])

[[Image:globec logo.jpg|150px|right|]]
'''Global Ocean Ecosystem Dynamics''' (GLOBEC) is the [[International Geosphere-Biosphere Programme]] (IGBP) core project responsible for understanding how global change will affect the abundance, diversity and productivity of marine populations. The programme was initiated by [[Scientific Committee on Oceanic Research|SCOR]] and the IOC of [[UNESCO]] in 1991, to understand how global change will affect the abundance, [[biodiversity|diversity]] and productivity of marine populations comprising a major component of [[oceanic ecosystem]]s.

The aim of GLOBEC is to advance our understanding of the structure and functioning of the global ocean ecosystem, its major subsystems, and its response to physical forcing so that a capability can be developed to forecast the responses of the marine ecosystem to global change.

==Structure==
GLOBEC encompasses an integrated suite of research activities consisting of Regional Programmes, National Activities and cross-cutting research focal activities. The GLOBEC programme has been developed by the Scientific Steering Committee (SSC) and is co-ordinated through the GLOBEC International Project Office (IPO).

'''Regional Programmes:'''
*Ecosystem Structure of Subarctic Seas (ESSAS)
*CLimate Impacts on Oceanic TOp Predators (CLIOTOP)
*[[International Council for the Exploration of the Sea|ICES]] Cod and Climate Change (CCC)
*[[North Pacific Marine Science Organization|PICES]] Climate Change and Carrying Capacity (CCCC)
*Southern Ocean GLOBEC (SO GLOBEC)
*Small Pelagic Fish and Climate Change (SPACC)
**{{see also|Fisheries and climate change}}

'''National Programmes:'''

GLOBEC has several active national programmes and scientists from nearly 30 countries participate in GLOBEC activities on a national or regional level.

[[Image:national wiki.jpg|national wiki.jpg]]

'''Focus Working Groups:'''

There are four GLOBEC cross-cutting research focal activities:
*Focus 1. Retrospective analysis
*Focus 2. Process studies
*Focus 3. [[Prediction]] and [[Scientific modelling|modelling]]
*Focus 4. Feedback from [[ecosystem change]]s

==Publications==

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6278">'''Global Production Networks (GPN)''' is a concept in [[economic development|development]]al literature which refers to "the nexus of interconnected functions, operations and transactions through which a specific [[product (business)|product]] or [[Service (economics)|service]] is produced, [[Distribution (business)|distributed]] and [[Consumption (economics)|consumed]]."&lt;ref name=Coe/&gt;

== Global Production Networks ==
A [[globalization|global]] production network is one whose interconnected nodes and links extend spatially across national boundaries and, in so doing, integrates parts of disparate national and [[subnational]] territories".&lt;ref name=Coe&gt;{{citation|title=Global production networks: Realizing the potential|journal=Journal of Economic Geography|volume=8|issue=3|pages=271–295|year=2008|last1=Coe|first1=N. M.|last2=Dicken|first2=P.|last3=Hess|first3=M.|doi=10.1093/jeg/lbn002}}&lt;/ref&gt; GPN frameworks combines the insights from the [[global value chain]] analysis, [[actor–network theory]] and literature on [[Varieties of Capitalism]]. GPN provides a relational framework that aims to encompass all the relevant actors in the production systems. GPN framework provides analytical platform that relates sub-national regional development&lt;ref&gt;Coe NM, Hess M, Yeung H. W-C, Dicken P, Henderson J (2004) Globalizing regional development: a global production networks perspective. Transactions of the Institute of British Geographers 29:468–484.&lt;/ref&gt; with clustering dynamics.&lt;ref&gt;Harald Bathelt and Peng-Fei Li, “Global Cluster Networks—Foreign Direct Investment Flows from Canada to China,” Journal of Economic Geography 14, no. 1 (2014): 45–71.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Historical development of concept ==
In 1990s the concept of [[value chain]] gained its credit among economists and business scholars. (Its prominent developer [[Michael Porter]]). The concept combined sequenced and interconnected activities in the process of value creation. Value chain concept focused on business activities, but not on the corporate power and institutional context. In 1994 Garry Gereffi, together with Miguel Korzeniewicz introduced the concept of Global Commodity Chains (GCC):

{{quote|sets of interorganizational networks clustered around one commodity or product, linking households, enterprises, and states to one another within the world-economy. These networks are situationally specific, socially constructed, and locally integrated, underscoring the social embeddedness of economic organization|Gereffi&lt;ref&gt;Gereffi, G. (1994) ‘The organisation of buyer-driven global commodity chains: how US retailers shape overseas production networks’, in G. Gereffi and M. Korzeniewicz (eds), Commodity Chains and Global Development. Westport: Praeger, pp. 95–122: 2&lt;/ref&gt;}} The concept was developed further by a number of authors that emphasized importance of chain governance in different commodities (e.g. automobiles, textile, electronics etc.)

At the beginning of 2000s a group of authors Jeffrey Henderson, Peter Dicken, Martin Hess, Neil Coe and Henry Wai-Chung Yeung, introduced GPN framework, that builds on the development of previous approaches to international production processes. At the same time it expands beyond the linearity of GCC approach to incorporate all kinds of network configuration. Adopting clear network perspective allows to embrace the complexity of multidimensional layers of production moving beyond the "linear progression of the product or service"&lt;ref&gt;Neil M. Coe, Peter Dicken, and Martin Hess, “Global Production Networks: Realizing the Potential,” Journal of Economic Geography 8, no. 3 (May 1, 2008): 271–95, doi:10.1093/jeg/lbn002.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Insights from the analysis of production networks ==
Analysis of the global production networks relies on the use of the input-output tables that links firms through the transactions involved in the product creation. Commodity chain literature considers firms as the nodes in a number of chains that transform inputs into outputs through a series of interconnected stages of production, later linked to distribution and consumption activities. Andersen and Christensen define five major types of connective nodes in supply networks: Local integrator, Export base, Import base, International spanner and Global integrator &lt;ref&gt;Poul Houman Andersen and Poul Rind Christensen, “Bridges over Troubled Water: Suppliers as Connective Nodes in Global Supply Networks,” Journal of Business Research 58, no. 9 (September 2005): 1261–73, doi:10.1016/j.jbusres.2003.04.002.&lt;/ref&gt; Hobday et al. argue that the core capability of the firms stem from their ability to manage network of components and subsystem suppliers.&lt;ref&gt;Hobday, M., Davies, A., Prencipe, A. (2005) Systems integration: a core capability of the modern corporation. Industrial and Corporate Change, 14: 1109–1143.&lt;/ref&gt;

To capture both vertical and horizontal links across the sequence of production process, Lazzarini introduced the concept of Netchain: "a set of networks {{sic|comprised |hide=y|of}} horizontal ties between firms within a particular industry or group, which are sequentially arranged based on vertical ties between firms in different layers ... Netchain analysis explicitly differentiates between horizontal (transactions in the same layer) and vertical ties (transactions between layers), mapping how agents in each layer are related to each other and to agents in other layers".&lt;ref&gt;Lazzarini, S., Chaddad, F. R., Cook, M. L. (2000) Integrating supply chain and network analysis: the study of netchains. Journal on Chain and Network Science, 1: 7–22.&lt;/ref&gt; Critical studies have explored production networks in the domain of ethics of production, for instance focusing on local effects or labor relations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Miszczynski|first=M.|date=2016-02-18|title=Global Production in a Romanian Village: Middle-Income Economy, Industrial Dislocation and the Reserve Army of Labor|journal=Critical Sociology|volume=43|issue=7–8|pages=1079–1092|language=en|doi=10.1177/0896920515623076}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Grate firing''' was the first [[combustion]] [[system]] used for [[solid fuel]]s. It now is used mainly for burning [[waste]] and [[biomass]], but also for smaller [[coal]] furnaces.

* Capacities 0.3 to 175 MWth in industry and CHP
* Fuel fired per grate area 1-2 MW/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, maximum grate area 100 m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;
* Grates are typical only suitable for coarse particles, for fine particles a spreader is required, increases max. capacity
* Primary air through the grate (also used for cooling) and secondary air

==Types==
[[File:1-wanderrost-kohlekessel travelling grate.JPG|thumb|right|travelling grate in an old steam boiler]]
;Travelling grate
:A moving grate which is covered with a fuel layer, 10-30 cm. Power control by means of varying the grate velocity

;Reciprocating grate
:For ash-rich, low calorific fuels like municipal waste, arrangement of stationary and moving grates -&gt; conveying and mixing (forward-moving type or reverse-action grate)

;Vibrating grate
:Water cooled membrane wall, with holes for air. For burning coal or wood.

==Grate area==
The grate area is the area of the grate (length x width). The larger the grate area, the more fuel can be burned per hour. The amount of fuel burned also depends on the fuel or bed movement velocity.

According to the 6th century BC mythographer [[Acusilaus]], '''Hesione''' ([[Help:IPA/English|/hɪˈsaɪ.əniː/]]; [[Ancient Greek]]: Ἡσιονη) was the daughter of [[Oceanus]], the wife of [[Prometheus]] and the mother of [[Deucalion]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Acusilaus]], fr. 34 Fowler (Fowler 2001, [https://books.google.com/books?id=j0nRE4C2WBgC&amp;pg=PA22 p. 22];  Fowler 2013, [https://books.google.com/books?id=scd8AQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA113 p. 113]; Freeman, [https://books.google.com/books?id=B75GgVdxYT0C&amp;pg=PA17 p. 17 fragment 33]).&lt;/ref&gt; That she was a daughter of Oceanus and wife of Prometheus, was also repeated in [[Aeschylus]]' ''[[Prometheus Bound]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Aeschylus]], ''[[Prometheus Bound]]'' [http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0085.tlg003.perseus-eng1:552-560 552&amp;ndash;560].&lt;/ref&gt; She may be identical to '''Pronoia''' (means "care" or "forethought") who was given as Deucalion's mother according to various sources.

[[Image:I Sea Glacier2.jpg|thumb|300px]]

The '''Irish Sea Glacier''' was a huge [[glacier]] during the Pleistocene Ice Age that, probably on more than one occasion, flowed southwards from its source areas in [[Scotland]] and [[Ireland]] and across the [[Isle of Man]], [[Anglesey]] and [[Pembrokeshire]].&lt;ref&gt;Lewis, CA and Richards, AE 2005 "The Glaciations of Wales and adjacent areas," Logaston Press, 228 pp.&lt;/ref&gt;  It probably reached its maximum extent during the Anglian Glaciation, and it was also extensive during the Late Devensian Glaciation (or Last Glacial Maximum).

It was the only clearly defined major glacier in the Irish Sea and flowed about 700&amp;nbsp;km from its source areas to its southernmost margin.  It is sometimes referred to as an “ice stream” since it appears to have been constrained not by ice-free land areas but by highlands which were themselves buried beneath ice.  At the time of its maximum extent the glacier extended all the way to the coasts of Somerset and Cornwall, along the south coast of Ireland, and even reached the [[Isles of Scilly]].

It was forced through a relatively narrow constriction in [[St George's Channel]] by ice flowing from the Irish Ice Cap (to the west) and the Welsh Ice Cap (to the east).  At one point the glacier was probably no more than 80&amp;nbsp;km wide.

Once through this constriction, in the Anglian Glaciation, the ice spread out into a great lobe, in the area now occupied by the [[Celtic Sea]] and the approaches to the [[Bristol Channel]].  On the eastern flank of the glacier, the evidence of striations, glacial deposits and "erratic trains" shows that the edge of the Irish Sea Glacier was pushed southwards by ice coming from the Welsh ice cap on the Brecon Beacons, so that Irish Sea ice flowed parallel with the coast of South Wales and then came into contact with the English coast around the Somerset Levels, between Exmoor and the Mendips.  It is not known how far inland this ice extended, but there are scattered glacial deposits  in the Bridgwater - Glastonbury district—these may mark the easternmost extent of the glacier.  On its western flank the Irish Sea Glacier reached Cork Harbour.  The maximum width of this great ice lobe was more than 320&amp;nbsp;km.  "Old" glacial deposits in South wales and in Pembrokeshire are still not accurately dated.

[[Image:Ice Surface (small).jpg|thumb|300px]]
Currently there is a great debate about the dating of the Devensian glaciation of the [[Isles of Scilly]].  The ice of the Irish Sea Glacier certainly pressed against the northern coasts of the islands, and accumulating evidence seems to show that this occurred some time after 24,000 years ago.&lt;ref&gt;Smedley, R.K. et al (2017) New age constraints for the limit of the British–Irish Ice Sheet on the Isles of Scilly. Journal of Quaternary Science 32(1), pp 48–62.&lt;/ref&gt;   During this same glacial episode the ice of the Irish Sea Glacier also swept along the southern Irish coast as far west as Cork, and reached its outer limit about 100&amp;nbsp;km to the SW of the Isles of Scilly.  Research suggests that the ice was everywhere grounded and not floating; this is consistent with the view that sea-level at the LGM was around 120m lower than it is today. Even further out in the southwest approaches, the ice edge was floating and calving.  One current theory is that the glacier moved to its outermost position by a "lobate surge partially propagated by high porewater pressures within deformable marine substrate",&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last1 = Scourse | first1 = J.D. | last2 = Furze | first2 = M.F.A. | chapter = Glacial marine geology of the Celtic Shelf and Goban Spur -- Porcupine continental margin | title = Isles of Scilly Field Guide | pages = 23–27 | publisher = QRA | year = 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; leaving parts of South Wales, the Bristol Channel and the coasts of SW England free of glacier ice.

However, glaciers have to behave according to the laws of ice physics, and a long narrow lobate surge with a flat long profile would be difficult to explain. Tightly confined "valley glaciers" do not exist on open tundra situations (such as this must have been at the time)especially if the glacier bed rises southwards.  Glacier ice in those circumstances must have "backed up" and spread sideways.  It is most likely that when the Irish Sea Glacier reached its southernmost extent, the glacier surface must have been at c 2,000m in St George’s Channel, c 2,250m over the Isle of Anglesey, and c 2,500m over the Isle of Man.  It follows that the mountains of Wales and Eastern Ireland must also have been submerged beneath thick glacier ice at the time.  Furthermore, the Bristol Channel is most likely to have been ice-filled at the LGM, as indicated on the adjoining map.

Recent work&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = O'Cofaigh | first1 = C.  | last2 = Evans | first2 = D.J.A. | title = Radiocarbon Constraints on the age of the maximum advance of the British-Irish Ice Sheet in the Celtic Sea  | journal = Quaternary Science Reviews | volume = 26 | pages = 1197–1203 | year = 2007 | doi=10.1016/j.quascirev.2007.03.008}}&lt;/ref&gt; suggests that the area outside the South Ireland End Moraine was inundated by Irish Ice during and after the LGM.  At the same time parts of the area outside the South Wales End Moraine must also have been inundated by ice.

Another puzzle is the extent to which the long profile of the Irish Sea Glacier, at the time of its maximum extent, approximated to the classic equilibrium profile.  Work in analogous situations in [[Marie Byrd Land]], [[Antarctica]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Sugden | first = D.E. | title = Selective glacial erosion and weathering zones in the coastal mountains of Marie Byrd Land, Antarctica | journal = Geomorphology | volume = 67 | pages = 317–334 | year = 2004 | doi=10.1016/j.geomorph.2004.10.007|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; suggests that the ice surface altitude over the mountains might have been around 800m lower than predicted.

[[Image:AS17-148-22714 crop.jpg|thumb|200px|S-IVB stage of Apollo 17. The one used for Apollo 12 is of identical type.]]

'''J002E3''' is the designation given to an object in space discovered on September 3, 2002 by amateur astronomer [[William Kwong Yu Yeung|Bill Yeung]]. Initially thought to be an [[asteroid]], it has since been tentatively identified as the [[S-IVB]] third [[Multistage rocket|stage]] of the [[Apollo 12]] [[Saturn V]] rocket (designated S-IVB-507), based on [[spectroscopy|spectrographic]] evidence consistent with the paint used on the rockets.&lt;ref name=NASA&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.spaceref.com/news/viewpr.html?pid=9497 | title=J002E3: An Update | website=SpaceRef |publisher=[[NASA]] | date = 2002-10-11 | accessdate = 2018-03-01 | first1 = Paul | last1 = Chodas | first2 = Steve | last2 = Chesley }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Jorgensen&gt;{{cite journal | bibcode = 2003DPS....35.3602J| last1 = Jorgensen | first1 = K. | last2 = Rivkin | first2 = A. | last3 = Binzel | first3 = R. | last4 = Whitely | first4 = R. | last5 = Hergenrother | first5 = C. | last6 = Chodas | first6 = P. | last7 = Chesley | first7 = S. | last8 = Vilas | first8 = F. | title = Observations of J002E3: Possible Discovery of an Apollo Rocket Body | journal = [[Bulletin of the American Astronomical Society]] | date = May 2003 | volume = 35 | page = 981 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The stage was intended to be injected into a permanent [[heliocentric orbit]] in November 1969, but is now believed instead to have gone into an unstable high Earth orbit which left Earth's proximity in 1971 and again in June 2003, with an approximately 40-year cycle between heliocentric and [[geocentric orbit]].

==Discovery==
When it was first discovered, it was quickly found that the object was in an [[orbit]] around [[Earth]]. Astronomers were surprised at this, as the [[Moon]] is the only large object in orbit around the Earth,&lt;ref group=note&gt;Also believed to orbit the Earth are the [[Kordylewski cloud]]s: large transient concentrations of dust at the [[Trojan points]] of the Earth–Moon system, discovered in 1956 by the [[Poland|Polish]] astronomer [[Kazimierz Kordylewski]].&lt;/ref&gt; and anything else would have been ejected long ago due to [[perturbation (astronomy)|perturbation]]s with the Earth, the Moon and the [[Sun]].

Therefore, it probably entered into [[Earth orbit]] very recently, yet there was no recently launched spacecraft that matched the orbit of J002E3. One explanation could have been that it was a 30-meter-wide piece of rock, but [[University of Arizona]] astronomers found that spectral observations of the object indicated a strong correlation of absorption features with a combination of human-made materials including white paint, black paint, and aluminum, consistent with [[Saturn V]] rockets.&lt;ref name=Jorgensen/&gt; Back-tracing its orbit showed that the object had been orbiting the Sun for 31 years and had last been in the vicinity of the Earth in 1971. This seemed to suggest that it was a part of the [[Apollo 14]] mission, but NASA knew the whereabouts of all hardware used for that mission; the third stage, for instance, was deliberately crashed into the Moon for seismic studies.

The most likely explanation appears to be the [[S-IVB]] third stage for [[Apollo 12]].&lt;ref name=NASA/&gt;&lt;ref name=Jorgensen/&gt; NASA had originally planned to direct the S-IVB into a solar orbit, but an extra long burn of the [[ullage motor]]s meant that venting the remaining [[propellant]] in the tank of the S-IVB did not give the rocket stage enough energy to escape the Earth–Moon system, and instead the stage ended up in a semi-stable orbit around the Earth after passing by the Moon on November 18, 1969.

It is thought that J002E3 left Earth orbit in June 2003, and that it may return to orbit the Earth in the mid-2040s.&lt;ref name=NASA/&gt;

==Potential impact with Earth or Moon==

The object's Earth orbital paths occasionally take it within the radius of the [[Moon]]'s orbit, and could result in eventual entry into Earth's atmosphere, or collision with the Moon.  The Apollo 12 empty S-IVB, Instrument Unit, and spacecraft adapter base, had a mass of about {{convert|30000|lb|kg|disp=flip|sigfig=2}}.&lt;ref name="Orloff"&gt;{{cite book | first = Richard W. | last = Orloff | title = Apollo By the Numbers: A Statistical Reference| url = https://history.nasa.gov/SP-4029/Apollo_18-19_Ground_Ignition_Weights.htm | date = September 2004 | publisher = | isbn = | chapter = Ground Ignition Weights }}&lt;/ref&gt; This is less than one-fifth of the {{convert|169900|lb|kg|adj=on|disp=flip}} mass of the [[Skylab|Skylab space station]], which was constructed from a similar S-IVB and fell out of orbit on July 11, 1979.&lt;ref name="skylaborbitalmass"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aerospaceguide.net/spacestation/skylab.html|title=Skylab Space Station|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Objects with a mass of about {{convert|10000|kg|lb}} enter Earth's atmosphere approximately 10 times a year,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Bland | first = Philip |date=December 2005 | title = The impact rate on Earth | journal = [[Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London A]]  | volume = 363 | pages = 2793–2810 | bibcode = 2005RSPTA.363.2793B | doi =10.1098/rsta.2005.1674 | issue =1837}}&lt;/ref&gt; one of which impacts the Earth's surface approximately once every 10 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bland | first1 = Philip A | last2 = Artemieva | first2 = Natalya A. | title = The rate of small impacts on Earth |date=April 2006 | journal = [[Meteoritics]] | volume = 41 | issue = 4 | pages = 607–631 | bibcode = 2006M&amp;PS...41..607B | doi = 10.1111/j.1945-5100.2006.tb00485.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Eleven essentially similar empty S-IVB stages from Apollo, Skylab and [[Apollo-Soyuz Test Project]] missions&lt;ref group=note&gt;The Apollo missions were: [[AS-201]], [[AS-202]], [[Apollo 4]], [[Apollo 5]], [[Apollo 6]], [[Apollo 7]], and [[Apollo 9]]. The Skylab missions were [[Skylab 2]], [[Skylab 3]], and [[Skylab 4]].&lt;/ref&gt; have re-entered the atmosphere from 1966 to 1975. In all cases (including the Skylab station), the objects burned in the atmosphere and broke into relatively small pieces, rather than striking the Earth as a single mass. On the other hand, these objects entered from low Earth orbit or ballistic trajectory, with less energy than J002E3 might possibly have if it were to enter from Solar orbit.

'''Land cover''' is the physical material at the surface of the earth. Land covers include [[grass]], [[asphalt]], [[tree]]s, bare ground, [[water]], etc. '''Earth cover''' is the expression used by ecologist [[Frederick Edward Clements]] that has its closest modern equivalent being [[vegetation]].&lt;ref name=MAB&gt;Makers of American Botany, [[Harry Baker Humphrey]], Ronald Press Company, Library of Congress Card Number 61-18435&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|52}} The expression continues to be used by the Bureau of Land Management.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Susitna MOA Earth Cover Classification|url=http://www.blm.gov/pgdata/etc/medialib/blm/ak/aktest/tr.Par.36173.File.dat/TR%2044.pdf|website=BlM-Alaska Technical Report 44|publisher=[[Bureau of Land Management]]|accessdate=15 June 2015|date=September 2002|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150923231458/http://www.blm.gov/pgdata/etc/medialib/blm/ak/aktest/tr.Par.36173.File.dat/TR%2044.pdf|archivedate=23 September 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are two primary methods for capturing information on land cover: field survey and analysis of [[Remote sensing|remotely sensed imagery]]. 

One of the major land cover issues (as with all [[natural resource]] inventories) is that every survey defines similarly named categories in different ways. For instance, there are many definitions of "[[forest]]"—sometimes within the same organisation—that may or may not incorporate a number of different forest features (e.g., stand height, canopy cover, strip width, inclusion of grasses, and rates of growth for [[wood production|timber production]]). Areas without trees may be classified as forest cover "if the intention is to re-plant" ([[UK]] and [[Ireland]]), while areas with many trees may not be labelled as forest "if the trees are not growing fast enough" ([[Norway]] and [[Finland]]). 

==Distinction from "land use"==
"Land cover" is distinct from "[[land use]]", despite the two terms often being used interchangeably. Land use is a description of how people ''utilize'' the land and of [[Socioeconomic development|socio-economic activity]]. [[Urban area|Urban]] and [[agricultural land]] uses are two of the most commonly known land use classes. At any one point or place, there may be multiple and alternate land uses, the specification of which may have a [[Politics|political]] dimension. The origins of the "land cover/land use" couplet and the implications of their confusion are discussed in Fisher et al. (2005).&lt;ref&gt;Fisher, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Lee Kong Chian Natural History Museum''' ('''LKCNHM''') ([[Simplified Chinese|Chinese]]: 李光前自然历史博物馆) is a museum of [[natural history]] at the Kent Ridge Campus of the [[National University of Singapore]]. Officially opened on 18 April 2015,&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/lee-kong-chian-natural/1792654.html|title = Lee Kong Chian Natural History Museum now open|date = 19 April 2015|website = Channel NewsAsia|access-date = 8 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; it houses the Raffles Natural History Collection. 

The idea for a natural history collection was first mooted by Sir [[Stamford Raffles]], and the collection of [[Southeast Asia]]n biodiversity was begun in 1849 at the Raffles Museum (now the [[National Museum of Singapore]]). In 1972, the [[Government of Singapore]] removed the natural history collections from the National Museum and gave them to the Zoology Department of what was then the University of Singapore. They were housed in various temporary premises, including the [[Nanyang Technological University]] for seven years. Subsequently, they were returned to the NUS and housed in the Raffles Museum of Biodiversity Research. LKCNHM inherited the natural history collections from the Raffles Museum of Biodiversity Research.&lt;ref name="LKCNHM"&gt;{{citation|title=About the Museum|url=http://lkcnhm.nus.edu.sg/nus/index.php/lkcnhm/aboutlkcnhm|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150624133731/http://lkcnhm.nus.edu.sg/nus/index.php/lkcnhm/aboutlkcnhm|archivedate=24 June 2015|publisher=Lee Kong Chian Natural History Museum|date=3 August 2015}}; {{citation|author=Tommy Koh|authorlink=Tommy Koh|title=Star attractions at new natural history museum: Once like an unwanted orphan, Singapore's natural history collection now has a permanent home in a new museum|url=http://www.straitstimes.com/opinion/star-attractions-at-new-natural-history-museum|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150823171234/http://www.straitstimes.com/opinion/star-attractions-at-new-natural-history-museum|archivedate=23 August 2015|newspaper=[[The Straits Times]]|date=2 May 2015}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Museum currently has more than 560,000 catalogued lots in its collection and over a million specimens from throughout the region.&lt;ref name="LKCNHM"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=Tan Dawn Wei|title=Museum homecoming for President Tan|url=http://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/museum-homecoming-for-president-tan|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150823171726/http://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/museum-homecoming-for-president-tan|archivedate=23 August 2015|newspaper=The Straits Times|date=26 March 2013}}.&lt;/ref&gt; About 2,000 of these are exhibited in the museum's galleries.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In February 2016, the museum announced that $1 million was raised for scientific and educational efforts related to the 10.6m adult female sperm whale carcass dubbed "Jubi Lee" found in Singapore waters July 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=Audrey Tan|title=$1.3m raised for sperm whale exhibit|url=http://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/environment/13m-raised-for-sperm-whale-exhibit|newspaper=The Straits Times|date=21 February 2016}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The "Jubilee Whale Exhibit" was unveiled on 14 March 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=Audrey Tan|title=Get up close to the Singapore whale at the Lee Kong Chian Natural History Museum|url=http://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/get-up-close-to-the-singapore-whale-at-the-lee-kong-chian-natural-history-museum|newspaper=The Straits Times|date=14 March 2016}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20538">This is a '''list of Superfund sites in North Carolina''' designated under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA) environmental law.  The CERCLA federal law of 1980 authorized the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) to create a list of [[Pollution|polluted]] locations requiring a long-term response to clean up hazardous material contaminations.&lt;ref&gt;P.L. 96-510, {{USC|42|9601|9675}}), December 11, 1980.&lt;/ref&gt;   These locations are known as [[Superfund]] sites, and are placed on the [[National Priorities List]] (NPL).  

The NPL guides the EPA in "determining which sites warrant further investigation" for [[environmental remediation]].&lt;ref name="NPL"/&gt;  As of December 16, 2010, there were 35 Superfund sites on the National Priorities List in [[North Carolina]].&lt;ref name="NPL"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.epa.gov/superfund/sites/npl/ |title=National Priorities List |publisher=United States Enivironmental Protection Agency |accessdate=December 16, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Two additional sites have been proposed for entry on the list.&lt;ref name="NPL"/&gt;  One site has been cleaned up and removed from the list, and four other sites have been partially deleted from the NPL.&lt;ref name="NPL"/&gt;

When a group of atoms is super-cooled to temperatures near absolute zero,  they form a [[Bose–Einstein condensate]], a [[state of matter]] where [[quantum]] effects can be observed in the [[Macroscopic scale|macroscopic]] system. In this state, the [[Trajectory|trajectories]] of the atoms can be manipulated using light.

If a super-cooled atomic gas is placed in a [[Standing wave|standing light wave]] produced by two counter-propagating [[lasers]] of certain frequency, the atoms are diffracted in different order. A cold atom absorbs a photon from one of the laser beams and emits a photon in the other beam receiving a net momentum of &lt;math&gt;2\hbar k &lt;/math&gt; in the direction of the absorbed [[photon]]. Here &lt;math&gt; k &lt;/math&gt; is the magnitude of the wave vector of the [[laser]]. This is called two-photon recoil process. In such situation, a [[Bose–Einstein condensate|BEC]] cloud sitting at the center of a trap is split into two identical clouds. The clouds then travel in opposite directions with a velocity, &lt;math&gt; v = 2\hbar k / m &lt;/math&gt; in the direction of the [[photon]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4021">The '''Maranhão Babaçu forests''' is a [[tropical and subtropical moist broadleaf forests|tropical moist broadleaf forest]] [[ecoregion]] of north-central [[Brazil]].

==Setting==
The Maranhão Babaçu forests cover an area of {{convert|142,300|km2|sqmi|sp=us}}, extending across northeastern and central [[Maranhão]] state and northern [[Piauí]] state. The forests form a transition between the equatorial forests of the [[Amazon biome]] to the west and the drier savannas and xeric shrublands to the south and east. The ecoregion is bounded by the [[Maranhão mangroves]] and the [[Northeastern Brazil restingas]] along the coast to the north, the [[Tocantins-Araguaia-Maranhão moist forests]] of Amazonia across the [[Pindaré River]] to the northwest and west, the [[Cerrado]] [[tropical and subtropical grasslands, savannas, and shrublands|tropical savanna]] to the south, and the [[Caatingas]] [[deserts and xeric shrublands|xeric shrublands]] to the east.

==Flora==
The Flora of the ecoregion is varied, with the western portion of the region hosting tall and diverse moist evergreen and semi-deciduous forests, while the eastern portion is a mosaic of open woodlands and shrublands, with patches of dry savanna. Seasonally wet savannas are found on the lower reaches of the major rivers.

The dominant tree in the region is the [[Attalea speciosa|Babaçu palm ''(Attalea speciosa)'']], an oil palm that occurs naturally along the southern edge of the Amazonian forests, but whose predominance has been extended by its tolerance to human-caused fires and forest clearing. Another common species is the Carnauba palm (''Copernicia prunifera).''

Carnauba palm is a very important palm species. It is the source of [[carnauba wax]], which is harvested from the coating on the leaves of the tree. The fruit and pith are eaten, the leaves are variously employed and the wood is used in building. In some places like Ceará State, it is known as the "Tree of Life".

==Fauna==
Babaçu forests are inhabited by many animal species, some of these are found in the rivers that cut the forest extension, others live in the forest itself. Birds like macaws, parrots are common. Herons and other aquatic birds are usually seen along the rivers banks and lake margins while hunting for crustaceans and fish.

There are also many species of mammals such as monkeys, wild dogs, felines, possums, armadillos, anteaters, wild pigs and the wild deer. Some species of aquatic mammals such as giant otters and river dolphins are also found there. Reptiles are also found in abundance, with many snakes and lizard species such as the green iguana and also some species of geckos. The amphibians are also abundant, being more common during the raining season, when it is possible to see a great number of toad and frog species.

In the water there are many species of animals such as fishes that belong to the Cichlidae and Characidae families and many crustaceans as well, some of these are freshwater shrimps and crabs.

Insects, spiders, centipedes and many other invertebrate species are very common and most of them are found during the night. Huge beetles are found in the region and their larvae, locally called "gongo" are an important nutritional source for many of the animals that live there and also for human beings that forage for nuts and occasionally are able to find some of these huge larvae.{{Empty section|date=July 2010}}

[[File:Matagh (Animal Sacrifice) - Armenia 2009.JPG|thumb|200px|Matagh of a rooster at the entrance of a monastery church (Alaverdi, Armenia, 2009), with inset of bloody steps.]]
In [[Armenian Apostolic Church|Armenian Christian]] tradition, '''matagh''' ({{lang-hy|[[wikt:մատաղ|մատաղ]]}} ''mataġ'') is a [[sheep|lamb]] or a [[rooster]] slated for [[sacrifice]] to [[God]], a [[ritual]] which has continued from the [[Paganism|pagan]] past.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}} In many regions of [[Armenia]] today, this practice is very much alive in the regular slaughter of chosen animals in front of [[Church (building)|churches]].&lt;ref&gt;Armenian Perspectives - Page 171 by Nicholas Awde, Association internationale des études arméniennes&lt;/ref&gt;
Matagh is done often to ask God for either [[forgiveness]], [[health]], or to give them something in return. People generally gather at the house where the Matagh was done, where they [[Prayer|pray]] and eat the meat. [[Tradition]] holds that the meat must be eaten before [[sunset|sundown]].

Additional information: The meat is to be prepared in a simple way stove top (usually Khashlama) with minimal spices.  It is not to be grilled over a fire.  Also the meat is supposed to be shared among 7 families (relatives and/or neighbors). In many cases a Matagh takes place as an act of thanksgiving to God after an accident or other life-threatening event with a good outcome.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4662">The '''National Environmental Satellite, Data, and Information Service''' (NESDIS) was created by the [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]] (NOAA) to operate and manage the United States environmental satellite programs, and manage the data gathered by the [[National Weather Service]] and other government agencies and departments.

==History==
In August 1980, the National Earth Satellite Service (NESS) was removed from the Office of Oceanic and Atmospheric Services and became a principal agency line organization in NOAA with an Assistant Administrator who reported directly to the Administrator. This move reflected the increasing importance of satellite observations to NOAA's environmental science and service responsibilities. It was largely precipitated by a decision by the Carter Administration in November 1979 to assign NOAA management responsibility for all civil operational remote sensing from space. NESDIS was formed in 1982 with the merger of NESS and the Environmental Data Service.

NESDIS has managed operational polar orbiting satellites (POES) since 1966. Additionally, NESDIS has managed operational [[geosynchronous satellites]] (GOES) satellites since 1974. New generations of satellites are being developed to succeed the current polar orbiting and geosynchronous satellites: the [[Joint Polar Satellite System]]) and [[GOES-R]]. The first satellite in the GOES-R series is scheduled for launch in October 2016. The launch of JPSS-1 is scheduled for no later than March 2017.

In 1979 NOAA's first [[Polar Operational Environmental Satellites|polar-orbiting environmental satellite]] was launched. Current operational satellites include [[NOAA-15]], [[NOAA-18]], [[NOAA-19]], [[GOES 13]], [[GOES 14]], [[GOES 15]], [[Jason-2]], and [[DSCOVR]]. Since May 1998 NESIDS has operated the [[Defense Meteorological Satellite Program]] (DMSP) satellites on behalf of the [[557th Weather Wing|Air Force Weather Agency]].

==Organization==
{{Update|section|reason=the section contains multiple dead links|date=December 2016}}
NESDIS's [[National Centers for Environmental Information]] (NCEI) archives data collected by the NOAA, [[U.S. Navy]], [[U.S. Air Force]], the [[Federal Aviation Administration]], and meteorological services around the world.  NCEI comprises the Center for Weather and Climate (previously NOAA's [[National Climatic Data Center]]) and the Center for Coasts, Oceans, and Geophysics (a merger of NOAA's [[National Coastal Data Development Center]] (NCDDC), [[National Oceanographic Data Center]] (NODC), and [[National Geophysical Data Center]] (NGDC)).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="44730">A '''nuclear fuel bank''' is reserve of [[Enriched uranium|low enriched uranium]] (LEU) for countries that need a backup source of LEU to fuel their nuclear reactors. Countries that do have enrichment technology would donate enriched fuel to a "bank", from which countries not possessing enrichment technology would obtain fuel for their [[Nuclear power|power reactors]].

The concept of providing an assured supply of nuclear fuel, and thus avoiding the need for countries to build indigenous nuclear fuel production capabilities, has long been proposed as a way to curb the proliferation of nuclear weapons and, eventually, eliminate them altogether.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=30113&amp;Cr=IAEA&amp;Cr1 UN News Centre: Proposed nuclear fuel bank reaches go-ahead funding level, UN agency says]&lt;/ref&gt; Austria,&lt;ref&gt;[http://daccess-dds-ny.un.org/doc/UNDOC/GEN/N07/324/52/PDF/N0732452.pdf?OpenElement Multilateralization of the nuclear fuel cycle paper submitted by Austria] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110728154544/http://daccess-dds-ny.un.org/doc/UNDOC/GEN/N07/324/52/PDF/N0732452.pdf?OpenElement |date=2011-07-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Russia,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.un.org/NPT2010/statements/Russian%20Federation_30_04_am_E.pdf 2010 Statement by H.E.

Many non-nuclear-weapon states have been reluctant to embrace any of these proposals for varying reasons.

==Overview==
Enrichment technology is primarily used to create enriched nuclear fuel, but it can also be used to create [[nuclear weapon|weapons-grade nuclear material]]. The main goal of a fuel bank is therefore to minimize the risk of further [[Nuclear proliferation|nuclear weapons proliferation]] by removing the need for countries to possess enrichment technology.

The proposed fuel bank would assure a back-up supply for power reactors throughout the world on a non-discriminatory, non-political basis, reducing the need for countries to develop their own uranium enrichment technologies at a time when concerns about nuclear proliferation are growing. The [[IAEA]]'s former Director General [[Mohamed ElBaradei|Dr. ElBaradei]] confirmed this, saying that the importance of nuclear fuel banks is "by providing reliable access to fuel at competitive market prices, we remove the need for countries to develop indigenous fuel cycle capabilities. In so doing, we could go a long way towards addressing current concerns about the dissemination of sensitive fuel cycle technologies."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iaea.org/NewsCenter/PressReleases/2006/prn200615.html IAEA: "IAEA Seeks Guarantees of Nuclear Fuel"]. September 15, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Need===
Dr. ElBaradei, who was director of the [[International Atomic Energy Agency]] from 1997 to 2009, called for the establishment of a nuclear fuel bank to provide peaceful access to nuclear energy without raising questions about dual-use technology. "Every country that would like to get the fuel, that would like to get the technology, the reactor, will get that, but not necessarily developing their own enrichment facility. And assurance of supply mechanism should be reliable, should be apolitical, should be based solely on non-proliferation criteria," he said.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his acceptance of the 2005 [[Nobel Peace Prize]], Dr. ElBaradei also said the establishment of an international fuel bank would remove the incentive for each country to develop its own fuel cycle. "We should then be able to agree on a moratorium on new national facilities, and to begin work on multinational arrangements for enrichment, fuel production, waste disposal and reprocessing," he said.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

[[Joseph Cirincione]], the director of the nonproliferation program at the [[Carnegie Endowment for International Peace]], says that an international fuel bank could start reforms at the international level. "If we handle it properly, [[Iran]] might be the trigger for resolving this problem that troubles all nations relying on nuclear power. Iran, ironically, could be the catalyst for creating a fundamentally new system of how we produce and sell nuclear fuel," he said.&lt;ref name=RFE&gt;{{cite news

U.S. Senators [[Richard Lugar]] and [[Evan Bayh]], both of [[Indiana]], have also advocated for a nuclear fuel bank. In an op-ed published in the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'', they wrote that what is needed is "a new international non-proliferation standard that prevents countries from using the guise of nuclear energy to develop nuclear weapons". Lugar and Bayh argued this was imperative because "the coming surge in demand for nuclear power will lead more and more nations to seek their own enrichment facilities", and jointly called for the establishment of an International Nuclear Fuel Bank, controlled by the [[International Atomic Energy Agency]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

In 2009, the formation of a nuclear fuel bank was endorsed by U.S. President Barack Obama in a [[Barack Obama speech in Prague, 2009|speech in Prague]]: "And we should build a new framework for civil nuclear cooperation, including an International Fuel Bank, so that countries can access peaceful power without increasing the risk of proliferation. That must be the right of every national that renounces nuclear weapons, especially for developing countries embarking on peaceful programs."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.whitehouse.gov/the_press_office/Remarks-By-President-Barack-Obama-In-Prague-As-Delivered Press Release] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120521034941/http://www.whitehouse.gov/the_press_office/Remarks-By-President-Barack-Obama-In-Prague-As-Delivered |date=2012-05-21 }} from the [[White House]] Office of the Press Secretary, retrieved on 7 June 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 29/08/2017, An International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) project aimed at providing confidence to countries about the availability of nuclear power fuel reached a key milestone on Tuesday towards its establishment, with the inauguration in Kazakhstan of a facility where low-enriched uranium (LEU) will be stored.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Jatinder|first1=Kaur|title=IAEA Inaugurates Low-enriched Uranium Bank in Kazakhstan|url=http://abclive.in/iaea-inaugurates-low-enriched-uranium-bank-kazakhstan/|accessdate=30 August 2017|issue=Online|publisher=ABC Live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Controversy===
Developing nations, including a number in the [[Non-Aligned Movement]], have expressed reservations about mechanisms for assurance of supply and have been critical of additional criteria for accessing the fuel banks.&lt;ref name=NRSBINT&gt;[http://books.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=12477&amp;page=25 Internationalization of the Nuclear Fuel Cycle: Goals, Strategies, and Challenges] (2009). Nuclear and Radiation Studies Board, National Academies Press.&lt;blockquote&gt;Some nations, notably some in the Non-Aligned Movement, are cautious about mechanisms for assurance of supply and critical of additional criteria for accessing them. From this perspective, whatever advantage is offered by a fuel bank, for example, is reduced if the suppliers can deny access.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Some reasons that non-nuclear weapon states have been reluctant to embrace these proposals include:&lt;ref name=ASIL&gt;[http://www.asil.org/insights080630.cfm American Society of International Law: The Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons: Taking Stock after the May 2008 Preparatory Committee Meeting] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130722170849/http://www.asil.org/insights080630.cfm |date=2013-07-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*a perception that the commercial or strategic interests of nuclear weapon states motivated the proposals
*a perception that the proposals produce a dependency on a limited number of nuclear fuel suppliers
*a perception that the proposal restricts their unalienable right to nuclear energy for peaceful purposes.

One example of such a feared political-cutoff came after the 1979 [[Iranian Revolution]]. Germany halted construction of the Iranian [[Bushehr Nuclear Power Plant|Bushehr reactor]], the United States cut off the supply of highly enriched fuel for the Tehran Research Reactor, and Iran never received uranium from France which it asserted it was entitled to. Russia also agreed not to provide an enrichment plant and terminated cooperation on several other nuclear-related technologies, including laser isotope separation. China terminated several nuclear projects in return in part for entry into force of a U.S.-China civil nuclear cooperation agreement. Ukraine agreed not to provide the turbine for the Bushehr reactor. These combined experiences contributed to an Iranian belief that foreign nuclear supplies are potentially subject to being interrupted.&lt;ref name=NRSBINT /&gt;&lt;!-- this material may be found in page 37 of the document --&gt; An international nuclear fuel bank would have to overcome this perception.

==History==

===1940–1969===
The ''Report on the International Control of Atomic Energy'', commonly known as the [[Acheson–Lilienthal Report]], was written by a United States committee in 1946 and discussed possible methods for the international control of [[nuclear weapon]]s and the avoidance of future [[nuclear warfare]]. The report was produced by the Committee on Atomic Energy, headed by [[Dean Acheson]] and [[David Lilienthal]], and was mostly written by scientist [[Robert Oppenheimer]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cfr.org/publication/19028/achesonlilienthal_report.html?breadcrumb=%2Fthinktank%2Fiigg%2Fmaterials%3Fpage%3D127 Council on Foreign Relations: Acheson–Lilienthal Report]{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; The report recommended that an international body, such as the United Nations, have control over both atomic materials and the means of producing nuclear energy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history.do?action=Article&amp;id=2620 ''History Channel'': Acheson–Lilienthal Report released] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090501071840/http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history.do?action=Article&amp;id=2620 |date=2009-05-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 	
Bruno Pellaud, the IAEA's former deputy director-general for safeguards, says the fuel bank idea was developed as far back as 1957.&lt;ref name=RFE&gt;{{cite news

The resulting [[Baruch Plan]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.state.gov/r/pa/ho/time/cwr/88100.htm U.S. State Department: The Acheson–Lilienthal &amp; Baruch Plans, 1946]&lt;/ref&gt; was a 1946 proposal by the [[United States]] government, written largely by political consultant [[Bernard Baruch]]. It was presented to the [[United Nations Atomic Energy Commission]] (UNAEC) at its first meeting in June 1946.  The plan proposed to:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.atomicarchive.com/Docs/Deterrence/BaruchPlan.shtml Atomic Archive: The Baruch Plan (Presented to the United Nations Atomic Energy Commission, June 14, 1946)]&lt;/ref&gt; 
# extend between all nations the exchange of basic scientific information for peaceful ends;
# implement control of [[nuclear power|atomic energy]] to the extent necessary to ensure its use only for peaceful purposes;
# eliminate from national armaments both atomic weapons and all other major weapons adaptable to mass destruction; and
# establish effective safeguards, by way of inspection and other means, to protect complying States against the hazards of violations and evasions
The plan clearly announced that the United States would maintain its nuclear weapons monopoly until every aspect of the proposal was in effect. The Soviets subsequently rejected the Baruch Plan, and the United States then rejected a Soviet counter-proposal for a ban on all nuclear weapons.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history.do?action=Article&amp;id=2699 ''The History Channel'': The United States presents the Baruch Plan] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090501081028/http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history.do?action=Article&amp;id=2699 |date=May 1, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1953, the U.S. proposed its [[Atoms for Peace]] plan. In a speech to the [[UN General Assembly]] in New York City on December 8, 1953, U.S. President [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] called on the United States with the Soviet Union "to make joint contributions from their stockpiles of normal uranium and fissionable materials to an international Atomic Energy Agency" that would then "devise methods whereby this fissionable material would be allocated to serve the peaceful pursuits of mankind."&lt;ref&gt;[http://eisenhower.archives.gov/Research/Digital_Documents/Atoms_For_Peace/New%20PDFs/Binder13.pdf Eisenhower Archive: Press Release, "Atoms for Peace" Speech, December 8, 1953 [DDE's Papers as President, Speech Series, Box 5, United Nations Speech 12/8/53&amp;#93;]&lt;/ref&gt;  The plan also proposed a new [[International Atomic Energy Agency]] and “uranium bank” as simple steps to establish international trust and start a cooperative arms control dialogue.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.armscontrol.org/act/2003_12/Lavoy ''Arms Control Association'': The Enduring Effects of Atoms for Peace]&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 29, 1957 the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) was established. However, the concept that the IAEA would serve as a bank of nuclear materials, drawing down US and Soviet stocks below the level where either could launch a knock-out blow against the other, languished. During this period the U.S. Congress preferred to supply nuclear material directly to foreign partners in bilateral agreements, thus bypassing the IAEA and applying U.S. safeguards to the transaction instead. It became clear that having the IAEA serve as a nuclear material bank had not succeeded in the [[Cold War]].
&lt;ref&gt;[http://www-pub.iaea.org/MTCD/publications/PDF/Pub1032_web.pdf History of the International Atomic Energy Agency : the first forty years], David Fischer, 1997, {{ISBN|92-0-102397-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1970–1989===
Through the 1970s and 1980s, further options were examined for developing a "proliferation-resistant" fuel cycle. The managerial aspects of the nuclear fuel cycle were also explored during this time and a number of unsuccessful proposals were advanced.&lt;ref name=MultiTime&gt;[http://www.iaea.org/NewsCenter/Focus/FuelCycle/key_events.shtml International Atomic Energy Agency: Multinational Approaches to Nuclear Fuel-Cycles in Historical Context - Timeline of Key Events] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080513074138/http://www.iaea.org/NewsCenter/Focus/FuelCycle/key_events.shtml |date=2008-05-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some of the proposals included initiatives on:&lt;ref name=MultiTime /&gt;
*Technical or physical modification of the fuel cycle to restrict access to sensitive nuclear materials
*Multilateral fuel cycle centers for a small number of States to pool their resources in to a single centre
*Multinational spent fuel centers as a way to handle separated plutonium;
*An international nuclear fuel authority to guarantee nuclear fuel to Non-Nuclear Weapon States which renounced national reprocessing or enrichment plants
*International plutonium storage to help implement Article XII. A.5 of the IAEA Statute

In the late 1970s, the International Nuclear Fuel Cycle Evaluation conducted a study into the management of [[spent nuclear fuel]]. The IAEA's "Working Group 6" issued a report on spent fuel management which identified interim storage of spent fuel as an important step in the nuclear fuel cycle. An earlier IAEA study on Regional Fuel Cycle Centre from 1977 has also pointed out the importance of spent fuel.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iaea.org/OurWork/ST/NE/NEFW/nfcms_spentfuel.html International Atomic Energy Agency: Management of Spent Fuel from Power Reactors]&lt;/ref&gt; The fuel cycle evaluation was formally launched in October 1977 by the [[Jimmy Carter|Carter Administration]], with more than 500 experts from 46 nations participating.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/33330/pierre-lellouche/international-nuclear-politics ''Foreign Affairs'': International Nuclear Politics]. Lellouche, Pierre. Winter 1979/80.&lt;/ref&gt;

The IAEA Board of Governors subsequently established the Committee on Assurances of Supply (CAS) in 1980 to address similar concerns.&lt;ref&gt;Internationalization of the Nuclear Fuel Cycle: Goals, Strategies, and Challenges (2009) Nuclear and Radiation Studies Board (NRSB)&lt;blockquote&gt;As INFCE came to an end, similar concerns led the IAEA Board of Governors to establish the Committee on Assurances of Supply (CAS) in 1980. While CAS discussed a wide range of assurance of supply issues and proposals over 7 years, it did not reach agreement, and lapsed into abeyance.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The Committee examined the issue of multinationalization of the fuel cycle, but was unable to reach a consensus and went into formal abeyance in 1987.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cic.nyu.edu/internationalsecurity/wmd_article.html Center on International Cooperation: Assurances of Nuclear Supply and Nuclear Non-Proliferation: the outcome of the IAEA Special Event (19–21 September 2006)] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080725103439/http://www.cic.nyu.edu/internationalsecurity/wmd_article.html |date=July 25, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===IAEA Expert Group===
Former IAEA Director General Dr. ElBaradei gave an international expert group the task of coming up with possible multilateral approaches to better control the sensitive parts of the nuclear fuel cycle. Dr. ElBaradei said that in recent years the nuclear non-proliferation regime has been under tremendous stress and noted the key is fairness and recognizing the interests of all parties. He also said that a lack of progress in confronting the growing risk of nuclear proliferation "could lead to self-destruction".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iaea.org/NewsCenter/News/2004/bettercontrols.html International Atomic Energy Agency: IAEA Director General Calls on Group to Study Possible Multilateral Approaches]&lt;/ref&gt;

The group made the following recommendations to strengthen controls over fuel enrichment, [[nuclear reprocessing|reprocessing of fuel]], [[List of nuclear waste treatment technologies|spent fuel repositories]] and [[Dry cask storage|spent fuel storage]]. They were:&lt;ref name=FindingsSummary&gt;[http://www.iaea.org/NewsCenter/News/2005/fuelcycle.html International Atomic Energy Agency: Expert Group Releases Findings on Multilateral Nuclear Approaches]&lt;/ref&gt;
# Reinforcing existing commercial market mechanisms on a case-by-case basis
# Developing and implementing international supply guarantees with IAEA participation
# Promoting voluntary conversion of existing facilities to multilateral nuclear approaches
# Creating, through voluntary agreements and contracts, multinational, and in particular regional, MNAs for new facilities
# The scenario of a further expansion of nuclear energy around the world might call for the development of a nuclear fuel cycle with stronger multilateral arrangements

The Expert Group included representatives from 26 countries. Bruno Pellaud, the Group's Chairman and former Head of IAEA Safeguards, said “a joint nuclear facility with multinational staff puts all participants under a greater scrutiny from peers and partners, a fact that strengthens non-proliferation and security…Moreover, they have the potential to facilitate the continued use of nuclear energy for peaceful purposes."&lt;ref name=FindingsSummary /&gt;

===Fuel banks and International Enrichment Center===

As of March 2011 the IAEA Board of Governors has approved the creation of two separate fuel banks. The first, formally established by the IAEA and the Russian government in March 2010, is owned, operated, and paid for by the Russian Federation and located near the Siberian city of Angarsk. The reserve has been fully stocked and became operational on 1 December 2010. The Board of Governors approved a second fuel reserve in December 2010, which will be owned and operated by the IAEA itself, but this fuel bank is not yet operational.&lt;ref name="NTI20110324"&gt;{{cite web|title=From Theory to Reality: The Evolution of Multilateral Assurance of Nuclear Fuel|url=http://www.nti.org/analysis/articles/evolution-multilateral-assurance-nuclear-fuel/|publisher=The Nuclear Threat Initiative|accessdate=20 August 2012|author=Cole J.

Kazatomprom proposed at the 2013 IAEA General Conference that Kazakhstan host the LEU bank at its Ulba Metallurgical Plant.&lt;ref name="афч"&gt;{{cite web|title=AGREEMENT ON IAEA FUEL BANK IN KAZAKHSTAN EXPECTED BY YEAREND, KAZATOMPROM|url=http://www.interfax.kz/?lang=eng&amp;int_id=expert_opinions&amp;news_id=1211|publisher=Interfax}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kazakhstan's Foreign Minister Erlan Idrissov said in an interview that the bank posed no environment threats and highlights Kazakhstan’s contribution into the global efforts of nonproliferation and peaceful use of nuclear power.&lt;ref name=FBsafe&gt;{{cite web|title=International nuclear fuel bank to be hosted in Kazakhstan poses no environmental risks|url=http://en.tengrinews.kz/politics_sub/International-nuclear-fuel-bank-to-be-hosted-in-Kazakhstan-poses-no-23362/|publisher=TengriNews}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The LEU bank is under construction in Ust-Kamenogorsk, Kazakhstan under the aegis of the IAEA.&lt;ref name="LEU6"&gt;{{cite web|title=Construction of International IAEA Low Enriched Uranium (LEU) Bank Underway|url=http://www.nti.org/analysis/atomic-pulse/construction-international-iaea-low-enriched-uranium-leu-bank-underway/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to the two fuel banks, the Russian Federation has also established an International Uranium Enrichment Center (IUEC) located at Angarsk. The IUEC is set up as a joint stock company between Russia's Rosatom Corporation holding 80% of the shares, Kazakhstani and Ukrainian corporations, while the government of Armenia slated to join the company in the future.&lt;ref name="NTI20110324" /&gt; The IUEC differs from the two fuel banks in several important ways. First, it is a for-profit entity owned by state-backed companies. As a result, unlike the fuel banks, it is preferential and exclusive in its provision of enrichment services. The IUEC gives preferential treatment to its shareholders when selling enrichment services, and is only available to states that do not have domestic enrichment capabilities and perform their obligations under the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. Like the fuel banks, it provides an alternative to the expensive start-up costs of an indigenous enrichment capacity, but unlike the fuel banks it provides a further financial incentive to its shareholders in the form of dividends.&lt;ref name="NTI20110324" /&gt;

==Low Enriched Uranium Bank in Kazakhstan==
The LEU bank opened on August 29, 2017. It is a physical reserve of up to 90 metric tons of LEU, sufficient to run a 1,000 MWe light-water reactor. Such a reactor can power a large city for three years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=IAEA LEU Storage Facility to open in Kazakhstan in mid-August: Minister|url=https://akipress.com/news:592444/|website=akipress.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The topic of a nuclear fuel bank was briefly mentioned by some members attending the [[Nuclear Security Summit (2010)]], a [[Summit (meeting)|summit]] being held in [[Washington, D.C.]] in April 2010 focusing on how to better safeguard [[weapons-grade]] [[plutonium]] and [[uranium]] to prevent [[nuclear terrorism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cnn.com/2010/POLITICS/04/12/nuclear.security.summit/index.html |title=Obama Hosts Two-day Summit on Nuclear Security |publisher=CNN |date=April 12, 2010 |accessdate=April 12, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Robert J. Einhorn, Special US Advisor on Non-Proliferation and Arms Control, said the [[Obama Administration]] has supported international fuel banks but that "this issue will come up at the [[NPT Review Conference|May NPT Review Conference]], but this is not the focus of" the Nuclear Security Summit.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thaindian.com/newsportal/world-news/us-hopes-summit-will-endorse-obama-approach-to-check-n-terrorism_100344795.html ''Thaindian News'': US hopes summit will endorse Obama approach to check n-terrorism]&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the focus on nuclear terrorism, Kazakhstan's president [[Nursultan Nazarbayev]] sought the U.S.'s backing to house a nuclear fuel bank while he was in Washington for the event&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702304703104575174180505414718?mod=rss_Today%27s_Most_Popular ''Wall Street Journal'': U.S. Tries to Keep Summit Nuclear]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fmprc.gov.cn/eng/xwfw/s2510/t677901.htm Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China: Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Jiang Yu's Regular Press Conference on April 6, 2010]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Prime Minister of Pakistan]] [[Yousaf Raza Gillani]] issued a statement saying Pakistan would like to act as a provider and "participate in any non-discriminatory nuclear fuel cycle assurance mechanism".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thenews.com.pk/print1.asp?id=233969 ''The News International'': National statement on nuclear security regime]{{dead link|date=December 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; The UAE also reconfirmed its $10 million pledge to the IAEA Nuclear Fuel Bank and its policy of foregoing domestic enrichment and spent fuel reprocessing.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wam.org.ae/servlet/Satellite?c=WamLocEnews&amp;cid=1267001201150&amp;p=1135099400124&amp;pagename=WAM%2FWamLocEnews%2FW-T-LEN-FullNews ''Emirates News Agency'': Mohammed Bin Zayed Al Nahyan Meets Korean and Chilean Presidents] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721080119/http://www.wam.org.ae/servlet/Satellite?c=WamLocEnews&amp;cid=1267001201150&amp;p=1135099400124&amp;pagename=WAM%2FWamLocEnews%2FW-T-LEN-FullNews |date=July 21, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 27, 2015 an agreement to locate the IAEA LEU Bank in Kazakhstan was signed in the country's capital [[Astana]]. The nuclear fuel bank aims to guarantee countries access to the uranium they need for a civilian nuclear program without having to develop enrichment processes themselves.&lt;ref name=LEU&gt;{{cite web|title=Modern Challenges Highlight Importance of IAEA LEU Bank in Kazakhstan|url=http://astanatimes.com/2015/08/modern-challenges-highlight-importance-of-iaea-leu-bank-in-kazakhstan/|website=Astana Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Proposals==
A fuel bank would act as a back-up supply for nuclear power reactors throughout the world on a non-discriminatory and apolitical basis, reducing the need for countries to develop their own uranium enrichment technologies at a time when concerns about nuclear proliferation are growing. Government and industry experts agree the fuel market functions well in meeting current demand, and a fuel bank would be designed inherently in a way not to disrupt the existing commercial market in nuclear fuels.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iaea.org/NewsCenter/PressReleases/2006/prn200615.html International Atomic Energy Agency: IAEA Seeks Guarantees of Nuclear Fuel]&lt;/ref&gt; Mohamed ElBaradei, director general of the IAEA from 1997 to 2009, has also suggested that no State should be required to give up its rights under the Non-Proliferation Treaty regarding any parts of the nuclear fuel cycle.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iaea.org/NewsCenter/News/2009/fbankmilestone.html International Atomic Energy Agency: Multinational Fuel Bank Proposal Reaches Key Milestone]&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2008, an IAEA magazine outlined 12 proposals for a multilateral approach that had been put forward.  The proposals ranged from providing backup assurances of supply to establishing an IAEA-controlled low-enriched uranium reserve or setting up international enrichment centers.&lt;ref name=FuelThought&gt;[http://www.iaea.org/Publications/Magazines/Bulletin/Bull492/49204845963.pdf International Atomic Energy Agency: Fuel for Thought.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081009021152/http://www.iaea.org/Publications/Magazines/Bulletin/Bull492/49204845963.pdf |date=2008-10-09 }} Rauf, Tariq and Vovchok, Zoryana. March 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2009, three proposals were recommended as the form an international fuel bank should take. Two proposals were for Russian and IAEA fuel banks to provide supply of last resort and were initially proposed by Dr. ElBaradei in 2003. [[Germany]] put forward a complementary proposal which advocated the creation of an internationally governed nuclear fuel production plant where production would be done in an extraterritorial site inside an unspecified country.&lt;ref name=Proposals&gt;{{cite web

Over 60 states, many of them developing nations, have informed the International Atomic Energy Agency that they have an interest in launching nuclear energy programs. However, some of these states have expressed concerns that they would lose all access to enrichment and reprocessing technology if they were to accept fuel from a fuel bank.&lt;ref name=Proposals /&gt;

===Kazakhstani Proposal===
Kazakhstan offered the Ulba Metallurgical Plant as a site for an IAEA administered fuel bank. The IAEA Board of Governors approved the plan to set up the fuel bank in December 2010, but made no choice of the site at that time. As of mid-2012, it was expected to accept Kazakhstan's proposal in time for the fuel bank to open in 2013.&lt;ref name=Ulba&gt;{{cite web|title=Kazakhstan offers Ulba as a site for IAEA fuel bank|url=http://fissilematerials.org/blog/2012/05/kazakhstan_offers_ulba_as.html|publisher=International Panel on Fissile Materials}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2015, the IAEA approved a Host-State Agreement, paving the way for Kazakhstan to host the LEU Bank.&lt;ref name="iaea.org"/&gt;

===German proposal===
Germany has proposed the creation of a multilateral uranium enrichment center with extraterritorial status, which would operate on a commercial basis as a new supplier in the market. The center would operate under Agency control and providing enrichment services to its customer. Customers could then obtain nuclear fuel for civilian use under strict supervision. Germany has also proposed a “Multilateral Enrichment Sanctuary Project” for an international enrichment center by a group of interested States, on an extraterritorial basis in a host State.&lt;ref name=FuelThought /&gt;

Kazakhstan has been considering hosting a site such as the one that the Germans are proposing.&lt;ref&gt;[http://gsn.nti.org/gsn/nw_20090520_6166.php IAEA Nuclear Threat Initiative: Governors to Consider Nuclear Fuel Bank Proposals]&lt;/ref&gt; "If a nuclear fuel bank for nuclear energy was created, then Kazakhstan would consider hosting it," Kazakh President [[Nursultan Nazarbayev]] has proposed. "We cannot have divides where some own nuclear technology and others not," [[Egypt]]ian diplomat and [[nonproliferation]] expert Mohamad Shaker countered. "Have-nots" must have an equal role in any technology consortiums, he said.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

===NTI funding proposal===
The Washington-based [[Nuclear Threat Initiative]]'s proposal for an international fuel bank announced an initial $50 million grant to the IAEA contingent upon an additional $100 million from other sources. The [[United States]] has offered $50 million, the [[United Arab Emirates]] has pledged $10 million, [[Norway]] has promised $5 million and the [[European Union]] agreed to provide up to 25 million euros (about $32 million in May 2009). The fuel bank therefore reached its initial funding target in March 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Former Senator [[Sam Nunn]], a co-Chairman of the [[Nuclear Threat Initiative]], said in a speech announcing the NTI pledge that "we envision that this stockpile will be available as a last-resort fuel reserve for nations that have made the sovereign choice to develop their nuclear energy based on foreign sources of fuel supply services-and therefore have no indigenous enrichment facilities." [[Warren Buffett]], a key NTI advisor, is financially backing and enabling the commitment. "This pledge is an investment in a safer world," Buffett said.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Countries that already enrich uranium favor the fuel bank because it keeps competitors from entering the market. Some emerging-market countries on the International Atomic Energy Agency Board of Governors have resisted the proposal. “It simply seems a real battlefield,” Iran’s IAEA ambassador, Aliasghar Soltanieh, said. “It’s an issue of trust, and there’s been a lot of fraying of relationships between IAEA states,” said Curtis, Deputy Secretary of Energy under [[President of the United States|President]] [[Bill Clinton]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

===Russian proposal===
[[Sergey Kiriyenko]], head of Russian nuclear corporation [[Rosatom]], has told the IAEA General Conference that Russia planned to put under IAEA control a reserve of $300 million worth of low enriched uranium. The fuel would be stored at a multinational uranium-enrichment facility in the Siberian city of [[Angarsk]] and would be sufficient for two reactor-loads of low-enriched uranium. “We should carry out the preparatory work required for the IAEA Director-General to propose to the IAEA Board of Governors that they consider Russia’s plans for establishing guaranteed nuclear fuel reserves in the first half of 2008,” Kiriyenko said. He further said that Russia is ready to process 4,000 tons of [[Australia]]n uranium a year.&lt;ref name=RusJS&gt;[http://www.armscontrol.org/print/2642 Arms Control Association: Russia Offers to Jump-Start IAEA Fuel Bank]&lt;/ref&gt;

Russia established its International Uranium Enrichment Center (IUEC) at the Angarsk Electrolysis Chemical Combine “to provide guaranteed access to uranium enrichment capabilities to the Centre’s participating organizations”. On 10 May 2007 the first agreement in the framework of the IUEC was signed by the Russian Federation and the Republic of Kazakhstan.&lt;ref name=FuelThought /&gt; In November 2009, the IAEA Board of Governors approved the Russian proposal to set up a low enriched uranium reserve available to Member States upon request from the Agency.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nuclearstreet.com/blogs/nuclear_power_news/archive/2010/03/30/statement-to-argentine-council-for-international-relations-03306.aspx Nuclear Street: IAEA's Yamano: Statement To Argentine Council For International Relations]&lt;/ref&gt; Russia and the IAEA agreed on March 30, 2010 to set up the world's first nuclear fuel bank, at [[Angarsk]] in [[Siberia]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rferl.org/content/Russia_IAEA_Agree_To_Establish_Worlds_First_Nuclear_Fuel_Bank/1997174.html Russia, IAEA Agree To Establish World's First Nuclear Fuel Bank]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Stanton|first=Chris|title=Nuclear fuel bank to open doors|url=http://www.thenational.ae/business/energy/nuclear-fuel-bank-to-open-doors|accessdate=20 August 2012|newspaper=TheNational|date=15 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Six-Country Concept===
The "Six-Country Concept" was proposed by France, Germany, the Netherlands, Russia, the UK, and the U.S. to provide reliable access to nuclear fuel. In 2008, all six of these nations had enrichment facilities. The proposal would require customer states to forego sensitive indigenous nuclear facilities, and if a supply disruption were to occur the recipient country would be able to approach the IAEA to facilitate new arrangements with other suppliers as long as nonproliferation conditions had been met – these conditions would include implementation of the Additional Protocol and safety and protection standards being satisfied.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thebulletin.org/web-edition/reports/the-future-of-gnep/the-future-of-gnep-the-international-partners Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists: "The future of GNEP: The international partners"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081208055022/http://www.thebulletin.org/web-edition/reports/the-future-of-gnep/the-future-of-gnep-the-international-partners |date=2008-12-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The six nations proposed two levels of enrichment assurance beyond the normal market. At the “basic assurances” level, suppliers would agree to substitute for each other to cover certain supply interruptions to customers. At the “reserves” assurance level, participating governments could provide physical or virtual reserves of low-enriched uranium that would be made available if the “basic assurances” were not met.&lt;ref name=FuelThought /&gt;

==Overview==
The goal of the Pacific Health Summit is to connect science, industry, and policy for a healthier world. Traditionally, the main work of the Summit has been an annual meeting, where top decision makers convene to discuss how to realize the dream of a healthier future through the effective utilization of scientific advances, combined with industrial innovation and appropriate policies. In autumn of 2012 on the heels of its eight major conference, the Summit shifted its focus from an annual meeting to more targeted work that builds on the past themes and concrete outcomes. As it has since 2005, the Summit will continue to provide a year-round forum for world leaders to grapple with problems and solutions, share best practices, and forge effective collaborations.

==History==
The first Pacific Health Summit was held in Seattle, Washington in 2005 with foundational support from the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation and the [http://www.trff.org/ Russell Family Foundation].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.seattlepi.com/local/article/Summit-hopes-to-spark-talks-on-Earth-s-health-1162197.php "Summit hopes to spark talks on Earth’s health", The Seattle Post-Intelligencer, 12/19/2004]&lt;/ref&gt; It was the co-creation of 2001 Nobel Prize in physiology or medicine winner [[Leland H. Hartwell]], businessman and philanthropist George F. Russell Jr., Co-chair of the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation [[William H. Gates Sr.]], and Founding Director of the National Bureau of Asian Research’s Center for Health and Aging Michael Birt.&lt;ref name="about"&gt;[http://pacifichealthsummit.org/about/About_the_Pacific_Health_Summit.pdf About the Summit] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120302222048/http://www.pacifichealthsummit.org/about/About_the_Pacific_Health_Summit.pdf |date=2012-03-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt; NBR has been the Secretariat of the Summit since the inaugural 2005 conference. 

Birt, founding Executive Director of the Summit, stepped down from his role as NBR’s Center for Health and Aging Director in 2009, and from his role as Executive Director in 2012, handing the mantle to Claire Topal, the Summit's Managing Director, who ran the Summit and managed the team from 2009-2012. She now serves as Senior Advisor for International Health to NBR. Nualchan Sakchalathorn, the Summit’s Project Director, served on the Summit team from 2007-2012.

Building on Bill Gates Sr.'s strong personal support, in 2007 [[Tachi Yamada]], then President of Global Health at the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation, took on a decisive leadership role and formally established the Foundation as the Summit's third co-presenting organization. 

In 2008, the Wellcome Trust joined the Summit as the fourth official co-presenting organization, and Trust Director, [[Sir Mark Walport]], joined our Executive Committee. Both [[Sir William Castell]], Chairman of the Wellcome Trust, who has participated in the Summit since its first year, and Sir Mark provided crucial leadership as the Summit began its rotation in London for the annual meeting.

Peter Neupert, then Corporate Vice President for Health Solutions Strategy for Microsoft, and [[Craig Mundie]], Chief Research and Strategy Officer of Microsoft, consistently provided a private sector perspective to the Summit's strategic discussions. Additionally, GE Healthcare, through Bill Castell in 2005, has always provided critical advice and perspective, as well as the critical founding sponsorship for the annual meeting. 

Out of this initial foundation of leadership, the Summit grew into one of the world's premier global health gatherings every year. In 2012, eight years after the inaugural meeting, which was never designed to take place in perpetuity, global health is in an exciting new place. The Summit’s interactive format has proliferated, and decision-makers across all sectors and geographies are collaborating on all the critical global health issues the Summit sought to address: health technology, pandemic flu, MDR-TB, vaccines, malnutrition, maternal and newborn health, and many more. While the Summit is proud of eight years of transformational conversations, countless new friendships, and exciting partnerships, there is still much work to do – and so much momentum on which to build. NBR is looking forward and excited to build on the Summit’s legacy in the years to come.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20898">{{short description|The outermost layer of the Earth that is composed of soil and subject to soil formation processes}}
{{pp-move-indef}}
The '''pedosphere''' (from [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] πέδον ''pedon'' "soil" or "earth" and σφαῖρα ''sphaira'' "sphere") is the outermost layer of the [[Earth]] that is composed of [[soil]] and subject to [[pedogenesis|soil formation processes]]. It exists at the interface of the [[lithosphere]], [[Earth's atmosphere|atmosphere]], [[hydrosphere]] and [[biosphere]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://soil.gsfc.nasa.gov/index.php?section=75 Elissa Shart Levine, 2001, The Pedosphere As A Hub]&lt;/ref&gt; The pedosphere is the skin of the Earth and only develops when there is a dynamic interaction between the atmosphere (air in and above the soil), biosphere (living organisms), lithosphere (unconsolidated [[regolith]] and consolidated [[bedrock]]) and the hydrosphere (water in, on and below the soil). The pedosphere is the foundation of terrestrial life on Earth. 

The pedosphere acts as the mediator of chemical and [[biogeochemical]] flux into and out of these respective systems and is made up of gaseous, mineralic, fluid and biologic components. The pedosphere lies within the Critical Zone, a broader interface that includes [[vegetation]], pedosphere, [[groundwater]] [[aquifer]] systems, regolith and finally ends at some depth in the [[bedrock]] where the biosphere and hydrosphere cease to make significant changes to the [[chemistry]] at depth. As part of the larger global system, any particular environment in which [[soil]] forms is influenced solely by its [[geographic]] position on the globe as climatic, geologic, biologic and [[Human impact on the environment|anthropogenic]] changes occur with changes in [[longitude]] and [[latitude]].

The pedosphere lies below the vegetative cover of the biosphere and above the hydrosphere and lithosphere. The soil forming process (pedogenesis) can begin without the aid of biology but is significantly quickened in the presence of biologic reactions. Soil formation begins with the chemical and/or physical breakdown of minerals to form the initial material that overlies the bedrock substrate. Biology quickens this by secreting acidic compounds (dominantly fulvic acids) that help break rock apart. Particular biologic pioneers are [[lichen]], mosses and seed bearing plants,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cooper|first1=R.|title=The Role of Lichens in Soil Formation and Plant Succession|journal=Ecology|date=1953|volume=34|issue=4|pages=805–807|doi=10.2307/1931347|jstor=1931347}}&lt;/ref&gt; but many other inorganic reactions take place that diversify the chemical makeup of the early soil layer. Once [[weathering]] and [[decomposition]] products accumulate, a coherent soil body allows the migration of fluids both vertically and laterally through the soil profile, causing [[ion exchange]] between solid, fluid and gaseous phases. As time progresses, the bulk [[geochemistry]] of the soil layer will deviate away from the initial composition of the bedrock and will evolve to a chemistry that reflects the type of reactions that take place in the soil.&lt;ref name="Schlesinger"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Schlesinger|first1=W.H..|last2=Bernhardt|first2=E.S.|title=Biogeochemistry: an analysis of global change|date=2013|publisher=Academic Press|location=Oxford|isbn=978-0123858740|edition=3rd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Lithosphere==
{{main|Lithosphere}}
The primary conditions for soil development are controlled by the chemical composition of the rock that the soil will eventually be forming on. Rock types that form the base of the soil profile are often either [[sedimentary]] (carbonate or siliceous), [[igneous]] or metaigneous (metamorphosed igneous rocks) or [[volcanic]] and metavolcanic rocks. The rock type and the processes that lead to its exposure at the surface are controlled by the regional geologic setting of the specific area under study, which revolve around the underlying theory of [[plate tectonics]], subsequent [[deformation (science)|deformation]], [[Tectonic uplift|uplift]], [[subsidence]] and [[deposition (sediment)|deposition]]. 

Metaigneous and metavolcanic rocks form the largest component of cratons and are high in silica. Igneous and volcanic rocks are also high in [[silica]] but with non-metamorphosed rock, weathering becomes faster and the mobilization of ions is more widespread. Rocks high in silica produce silicic acid as a weathering product. There are few rock types that lead to localized enrichment of some of the biologically limiting elements like [[phosphorus]] (P) and [[nitrogen]] (N). Phosphatic shale (&lt;15% P&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;) and phosphorite (&gt;15% P&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;) form in [[Hypoxia (environmental)|anoxic]] deep water basins that preserve organic material.&lt;ref&gt;Boggs, S., Jr., 1995, Principles of Sedimentary and Stratigraphy. Prentice Hall, NJ, USA&lt;/ref&gt; Greenstone ([[metabasalt]]), [[phyllite]] and [[schist]] release up to 30-50% of the nitrogen pool.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Holloway|first1= J.|last2= Dahlgren|first2= R.|date= 1999|title= Geologic nitrogen in terrestrial biogeochemical cycling|journal=Geology|volume= 27|issue= 6|page= 567|doi=10.1130/0091-7613(1999)027&lt;0567:GNITBC&gt;2.3.CO;2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thick successions of [[carbonate]] rocks are often deposited on [[craton]] margins during sea level rise.

==Weathering and dissolution of minerals==
{{main|Weathering}}
The process of soil formation is dominated by chemical weathering of silicate minerals, aided by acidic products of pioneering plants and organisms as well as carbonic acid inputs from the atmosphere. Carbonic acid is produced in the atmosphere and soil layers through the carbonation reaction.

&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{H_2O + CO_2 \longrightarrow H^{+} + HCO_3^{-} \longrightarrow H_2CO_3}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref name="Schlesinger" /&gt;

This is the dominant form of chemical weathering and aides in the breakdown of carbonate minerals like calcite and dolomite and silicate minerals like [[feldspar]]. The breakdown of the Na-feldspar, [[albite]], by carbonic acid to form [[kaolinite]] [[clay]] is as follows:

&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{2 \ NaAlSi_3O_8 + 2 \ H_2CO_3 + 9 \ H_2O \longrightarrow 2 \ Na^{+} + 2 \ HCO_3^{-} + 4 \ H_4SiO_4 + Al_2Si_2O_5(OH)_4}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref name="Schlesinger" /&gt;

Evidence of this reaction in the field would be elevated levels of [[bicarbonate]] (HCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;), sodium and silica ions in the water runoff.
The breakdown of carbonate minerals:

&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{CaCO_3 + H_2CO_3 \longrightarrow Ca^{2+} + 2 \ HCO_3^{-}}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref name="Schlesinger" /&gt;		or		&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{CaCO_3 \longrightarrow Ca^{2+} + CO_3^{2-}}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref name="Faure" /&gt;	

The further dissolution of carbonic acid (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) and bicarbonate (HCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) produces CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; gas. Oxidization is also a major contributor to the breakdown of many silicate minerals and formation of secondary minerals ([[diagenesis]]) in the early soil profile. Oxidation of [[Olivine]] (FeMgSiO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) releases Fe, Mg and Si ions.&lt;ref&gt;Grandstaff, D., 1986, The dissolution rate of forsteritic olivine from Hawaiian beach sand: Rates of chemical weathering of rocks and minerals, p. 41–59.&lt;/ref&gt; The Mg is soluble in water and is carried in the runoff but the Fe often reacts with oxygen to precipitate Fe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; ([[hematite]]), the oxidized state of iron oxide. Sulfur, a byproduct of decaying organic material will also react to Fe to form [[pyrite]] (FeS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) but often in reducing environments. Pyrite dissolution leads to high [[pH]] levels due to elevated H+ ions and further precipitation of Fe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;ref name="Schlesinger" /&gt; ultimately changing the [[redox]] conditions of the environment.

==Biosphere==
{{main|Biosphere}}
Inputs from the biosphere may begin with lichen and other microorganisms that secrete [[oxalic acid]]. These microorganisms, associated with the lichen community or independently inhabiting rocks, include a number of [[blue-green algae]], [[green algae]], various [[fungi]], and numerous [[bacteria]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Chen|first1=J.|last2=Blume|first2=H.-P.|last3=Beyer|first3=L.|title=Weathering of rocks induced by lichen colonization — a review|journal=CATENA|date=2000|volume=39|issue=2|pages=121–146|doi=10.1016/S0341-8162(99)00085-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lichen]] has long been viewed as the pioneers of soil development as the following statement suggests:

“The initial conversion of rock into soil is carried on by the pioneer lichens and their successors, the mosses, in which the hair-like rhizoids assume the role of roots in breaking down the surface into fine dust&lt;ref&gt;Clements, F.E., and Shelford, V.E., 1939, Bioecology. John Wiley, New York.&lt;/ref&gt;”

However, lichens are not necessarily the only pioneering organisms nor the earliest form of soil formation as it has been documented that seed-bearing plants may occupy an area and colonize quicker than lichen. Also, eolian sedimentation can produce high rates of sediment accumulation. Nonetheless, lichen can certainly withstand harsher conditions than most vascular plants and although they have slower colonization rates, do form the dominant group in alpine regions. 

Acids released from plant roots include acetic and citric acids. During the decay of organic matter Phenolic acids are released from plant matter and humic and fulvic acids are released by soil microbes. These organic acids speed up chemical weathering by combining with some of the weathering products in a process known as chelation. In the soil profile, the organic acids are often concentrated at the top while carbonic acid plays a larger role towards the bottom or below in the aquifer.&lt;ref name="Schlesinger" /&gt;
 
As the soil column develops further into thicker accumulations, larger animals come to inhabit the soil and continue to alter the chemical evolution of their respective [[Ecological niche|niche]]. [[Earthworms]] aerate the soil and convert large amounts of organic matter into rich [[humus]], improving soil fertility. Small burrowing [[mammal]]s store food, grow young and may [[hibernate]] in the pedosphere altering the course of soil evolution. Large mammalian [[herbivores]] above ground transport nutrients in form of nitrogen-rich waste and phosphorus-rich antlers while predators leave phosphorus-rich piles of bones on the soil surface, leading the localized enrichment of the soil below.

==Redox conditions in wetland soils==
[[Nutrient cycle|Nutrient cycling]] in lakes and freshwater wetlands depends heavily on redox conditions.&lt;ref name="Schlesinger" /&gt; Under a few millimeters of water [[heterotrophic]] bacteria metabolize and consume oxygen. They therefore deplete the soil of oxygen and create the need for anaerobic respiration. Some anaerobic microbial processes include [[denitrification]], sulfate reduction and [[methanogenesis]] and are responsible for the release of N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (nitrogen), H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S ([[hydrogen sulfide]]) and CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; ([[methane]]).  Other [[Anaerobic organism|anaerobic]] microbial processes are linked to changes in the oxidation state of [[iron]] and [[manganese]].  As a result of anaerobic decomposition, the soil stores large amounts of organic carbon because decomposition is incomplete.&lt;ref name="Schlesinger" /&gt;

The redox potential describes which way chemical reactions will proceed in oxygen deficient soils and controls the nutrient cycling in flooded systems. Redox potential, or reduction potential, is used to express the likelihood of an environment to receive [[electrons]]&lt;ref name="Schlesinger" /&gt; and therefore become reduced. For example, if a system already has plenty of electrons (anoxic, organic-rich [[shale]]) it is reduced and will likely donate electrons to a part of the system that has a low concentration of electrons, or an oxidized environment, to equilibrate to the chemical gradient. The oxidized environment has high redox potential, whereas the reduced environment has a low redox potential. 

The redox potential is controlled by the oxidation state of the chemical species, pH and the amount of [[oxygen]] (O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) there is in the system. The oxidizing environment accepts electrons because of the presence of O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, which acts as electron acceptors:

&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{O_2 + 4 \ e^{-} + 4 \ H^{+} \longrightarrow H_2O}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref name="Schlesinger" /&gt;

This equation will tend to move to the right in acidic conditions which causes higher redox potentials to be found at lower pH levels. Bacteria, heterotrophic organisms, consume oxygen while decomposing organic material which depletes the soils of oxygen, thus increasing the redox potential. In low redox conditions the deposition of ferrous iron (Fe&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;) will increase with decreasing decomposition rates, thus preserving organic remains and depositing humus. At high redox potential, the oxidized form of iron, ferric iron (Fe&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;), will be deposited commonly as [[hematite]]. By using analytical geochemical tools such as [[x-ray fluorescence]] (XRF) or inductively coupled [[mass spectrometry]] (ICP-MS) the two forms of Fe (Fe&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; and Fe&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;) can be measured in ancient rocks therefore determining the redox potential for ancient soils. 

Such a study was done on [[Permian]] through [[Triassic]] rocks (300-200 million years old) in Japan and British Columbia. The geologists found hematite throughout the early and middle Permian but began to find the reduced form of iron in pyrite within the ancient soils near the end of the Permian and into the Triassic. This suggests that conditions became less oxygen rich, even anoxic, during the late Permian, which eventually led to the greatest extinction in [[earth]]’s history, the [[P-T extinction]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Isozaki|first1=Y.|title=Permo-Triassic Boundary Superanoxia and Stratified Superocean: Records from Lost Deep Sea|journal=Science|date=1997|volume=276|issue=5310|pages=235–238|doi=10.1126/science.276.5310.235}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Decomposition in anoxic or reduced soils is also carried out by sulfur-reducing bacteria which, instead of O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; use SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt; as an electron acceptor and produce hydrogen sulfide (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S) and carbon dioxide in the process:

&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{2 \ H^{+} + SO_4^{2-} + 2(CH_2O) \longrightarrow 2 \ CO_2 + H_2S + 2 \ H_2O}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref name="Schlesinger" /&gt;

The H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S gas percolates upwards and reacts with Fe&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; and precipitates pyrite, acting as a trap for the toxic H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S gas. However, H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S is still a large fraction of emissions from wetland soils.&lt;ref&gt;Kelly, D., and Smith, N., 1990, Organic sulfur compounds in the environment: biogeochemistry, microbiology, and ecological aspects: Advances in microbial ecology, v. 11, p. 345-385.&lt;/ref&gt; In most freshwater wetlands there is little sulfate (SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt;) so [[methanogenesis]] becomes the dominant form of decomposition by methanogenic bacteria only when sulfate is depleted. [[Acetate]], a compound that is a byproduct of fermenting [[cellulose]] is split by methanogenic bacteria to produce methane (CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) and carbon dioxide (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), which are released to the atmosphere. Methane is also released during the reduction of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; by the same bacteria.&lt;ref name="Schlesinger" /&gt;

==Atmosphere==
{{main|Atmosphere}}
In the pedosphere it is safe to assume that gases are in equilibrium with the atmosphere.&lt;ref name="Faure" /&gt; Because plant roots and soil microbes release CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to the soil, the concentration of bicarbonate(HCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) in soil waters is much greater than that in equilibrium with the atmosphere,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Piñol|first1=J.|last2=Alcañiz|first2=J.M.|last3=Rodà|first3=F.|title=Carbon dioxide efflux and pCO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in soils of three ''Quercus ilex'' montane forests|journal=Biogeochemistry|date=1995|volume=30|issue=3|pages=191–215|doi=10.1007/BF02186413}}&lt;/ref&gt; the high concentration of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and the occurrence of metals in soil solutions results in lower pH levels in the soil. Gases that escape from the pedosphere to the atmosphere include the gaseous byproducts of carbonate dissolution, decomposition, redox reactions and microbial [[photosynthesis]]. The main inputs from the atmosphere are [[Aeolian processes|aeolian]] [[sedimentation]], [[rainfall]] and [[gas]] [[diffusion]]. Eolian sedimentation includes anything that can be entrained by wind or that stays suspended, seemingly indefinitely, in air and includes a wide variety of [[aerosol]] particles, biological particles like pollen and dust to pure quartz sand. Nitrogen is the most abundant constituent in rain (after water), as water vapor utilizes aerosol particles to nucleate rain droplets.&lt;ref name="Schlesinger" /&gt;

==Soil in forests==
Soil is well developed in the [[forest]] as suggested by the thick humus layers, rich diversity of large trees and [[animal]]s that live there. In forests, precipitation exceeds [[evapotranspiration]] which results in an excess of water that percolates downward through the soil layers. Slow rates of decomposition leads to large amounts of fulvic acid, greatly enhancing chemical weathering. The downward [[percolation]], in conjunction with chemical weathering leaches [[magnesium]] (Mg), [[iron]] (Fe), and [[aluminum]] (Al) from the soil and transports them downward, a process known as [[podzolization]]. This process leads to marked contrasts in the appearance and chemistry of the soil layers.&lt;ref name="Schlesinger" /&gt;

==Soil in the tropics==
Tropical forests ([[rainforests]]) receive more [[insolation]] and rainfall over longer growing seasons than any other environment on earth. With these elevated temperatures, insolation and rainfall, biomass is extremely productive leading to the production of as much as 800 grams of carbon per square meter per year.&lt;ref name="Schlesinger" /&gt; Higher temperatures and larger amounts of water contribute to higher rates of chemical weathering. Increased rates of decomposition cause smaller amounts of fulvic acid to percolate and leach metals from the zone of active weathering. Thus, in stark contrast to soil in forests, tropical forests have little to no podzolization and therefore do not have marked visual and chemical contrasts with the soil layers. Instead, the mobile metals Mg, Fe and Al are precipitated as oxide minerals giving the soil a rusty red color.&lt;ref name="Schlesinger" /&gt;

==Soil in grasslands and deserts==
Precipitation in [[grasslands]] is equal to or less than evapotranspiration and causes soil development to operate in relative drought.&lt;ref name="Schlesinger" /&gt; Leaching and migration of weathering products is therefore decreased. Large amounts of evaporation causes buildup of calcium (Ca) and other large cations flocculate clay minerals and fulvic acids in the upper soil profile. Impermeable clay limits downward percolation of water and fulvic acids, reducing chemical weathering and podzolization. The depth to the maximum concentration of clay increases in areas of increased precipitation and leaching. When leaching is decreased, the Ca precipitates as calcite (CaCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) in the lower soil levels, a layer known as [[caliche (mineral)|caliche]]. 

Deserts behave similarly to grasslands but operate in constant drought as precipitation is less than evapotranspiration. Chemical weathering proceeds more slowly than in grasslands and beneath the caliche layer may be a layer of [[gypsum]] and [[halite]].&lt;ref name="Schlesinger" /&gt; To study soils in deserts, pedologists have used the concept of chronosequences to relate timing and development of the soil layers. It has been shown that P is leached very quickly from the system and therefore decreases with increasing age.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lajtha|first1=K.|last2=Schlesinger|first2=W.H.|title=The Biogeochemistry of Phosphorus Cycling and Phosphorus Availability Along a Desert Soil Chronosequence|journal=Ecology|date=1988|volume=69|issue=1|pages=24–39|doi=10.2307/1943157|jstor=1943157}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, carbon buildup in the soils is decreased due to slower decomposition rates. As a result, the rates of carbon circulation in the biogeochemical cycle is decreased.

[[File:Penedès region and DO.svg|thumb|right|280px|Penedès region (in blue) and Penedès DO (in blue and green) within Catalonia.]]
'''Penedès''' ({{IPA-ca|pənəˈðɛs}}) is a [[natural region|natural]] and [[historical region]] of the autonomous community of [[Catalonia]], [[Spain]]. It is located in the south of the Principality of Catalonia between the pre-coastal mountain range (''Serralada Pre-litoral'') and the [[Mediterranean Sea]]. The [[comarques of Catalonia|comarcal]] division of the [[Generalitat de Catalunya]] in 1936 and 1987, divided Penedès into three administrative comarques: [[Alt Penedès]], [[Baix Penedès]] and [[Garraf]], and their capitals are [[Vilafranca del Penedès]], [[el Vendrell]] and [[Vilanova i la Geltrú]]. 

From the historical point of view, Penedès was since the start of the ninth century a border region inside the [[county of Barcelona]], which had its center in the former military town [[Olèrdola]], fortified again because of the Christian advance in 929. Olèrdola lost its defensive significance and the capital in the second half of the twelfth century and then Vilafranca del Penedès became the capital. During the thirteenth century formed the [[Vegueria]] of Vilafranca including all Penedès and most of Anoia as the sots-vegueria of Igualada.

The provincial division of the 1833 divide the region between the provinces of [[province of Barcelona|Barcelona]], which includes [[Alt Penedès]] and [[Garraf]], and the [[province of Tarragona]], which includes Baix Penedès.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.grec.cat/cgibin/ggcc01cl.pgm?USUARI=&amp;SESSIO=&amp;PGMORI=&amp;NDCHEC=0608399 GGCC, Penedès]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Wine production==
Penedès is a wine-producing region having a Spanish [[Denominación de Origen|Denominació d'Origen]] (DO). Penedès DO includes all Penedès region and municipalities of four other [[Comarques of Catalonia|comarques]]: [[Anoia]], [[Alt Camp]], [[Baix Llobregat]] and [[Tarragonès]]. The area is framed by the coastal hills of the [[Serra del Garraf]] and the higher inland mountains which skirt the [[Catalan Central Depression]]. Long considered one of the country's best wine-producing regions after the [[Rioja (wine)|Rioja]], it is also one of the most ancient viticultural areas in [[Europe]]. Perhaps better-known for its [[Cava (Spanish wine)|Cava]] production, a [[sparkling wine]] which has had its own ''Denominació d'Origen'' since 1991, white [[grape]] varieties predominate, although the region also produces some highly regarded, oak-aged reds.

'''Peter Bradford Benchley''' (May 8, 1940 – February 11, 2006) was an American author, screenwriter, and ocean activist. He is known for the bestselling novel ''[[Jaws (novel)|Jaws]]'' and co-wrote its subsequent [[Jaws (film)|film adaptation]] with [[Carl Gottlieb]]. Several more of his works were also adapted for both cinema and television, including ''[[The Deep (1977 film)|The Deep]]'', ''[[The Island (Benchley novel)|The Island]]'', ''[[Beast (Benchley novel)|Beast]]'', and ''[[White Shark (novel)|White Shark]]''.

Later in life, Benchley came to regret writing such sensationalist literature about [[shark]]s, which he felt encouraged excessive fear and unnecessary culls of such an important predator in ocean [[ecosystem]]s and became an outspoken advocate for [[marine conservation]].

== Early life ==
Benchley was the son of Marjorie (née Bradford) and author [[Nathaniel Benchley]] and grandson of [[Algonquin Round Table]] founder [[Robert Benchley]]. His younger brother, [[Nat Benchley]], is a writer and actor. Peter Benchley was an alumnus of the [[Allen-Stevenson School]], [[Phillips Exeter Academy]] and [[Harvard University]].

After graduating from college in 1961, Benchley travelled around the world for a year. The experience was told in his first book, a travel memoir titled ''Time and a Ticket'', published by Houghton Mifflin in 1964. Following his return to America, Benchley spent six months reserve duty in the [[Marine Corps]], and then became a reporter for ''[[The Washington Post]]''.&lt;ref name=guardian/&gt; While dining at an inn in [[Nantucket]], Benchley met Winifred "Wendy" Wesson, whom he dated and then married the following year, 1964. By then Benchley was in New York, working as television editor for ''[[Newsweek]]''. In 1967 he became a speechwriter in the [[White House]] for President [[Lyndon B. Johnson]], and saw the birth of his daughter Tracy.&lt;ref name=wendy&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.towntopics.com/apr0208/stratton.php |title=After Nine Years on Borough Council, Wendy Benchley Sets New Agenda |last=Stratton |first=Jean |date=2 April 2008 |access-date=12 May 2018 |volume=62 |issue=14 |newspaper=[[Town Topics (newspaper)|Town Topics]] |publisher=Princeton's Weekly Community}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Once Johnson's term ended in 1969, the Benchleys moved out of Washington, and lived in various houses, including an island off [[Stonington, Connecticut]] where son Clayton was born in 1969. Benchley wanted to be near New York, and the family eventually got a house at [[Pennington, New Jersey]] in 1970.&lt;ref name=wendy/&gt; Since his home had no space for an office, Benchley rented a room above a furnace supply company.&lt;ref name=life&gt;{{cite book |last=Benchley |first=Peter |date=4 June 2002 |title=Shark Life: True Stories About Sharks &amp; the Sea |location=New York |publisher=[[Random House Publishing Group]] |isbn=0-307-54574-1 |pages=14–19 |chapter=2: Jaws |url=https://books.google.es/books?id=5CsIlp4GnrIC&amp;pg=PT14 |chapter-url=https://books.google.es/books?id=5CsIlp4GnrIC&amp;pg=PT12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== ''Jaws'' ==
By 1971, Benchley was doing various freelance jobs in his struggle to support his wife and children. During this period, when Benchley would later declare he was "making one final attempt to stay alive as a writer", his literary agent arranged meetings with publishers. Benchley would frequently pitch two ideas, a non-fiction book about pirates, and a novel depicting a man-eating shark terrorizing a community. This idea had been developed by Benchley since he had read a news report of a fisherman catching a {{convert|4550|lb|kg}} [[great white shark]] off the coast of [[Long Island]] in 1964. The shark novel eventually attracted [[Doubleday (publisher)|Doubleday]] editor [[Thomas Congdon]], who offered Benchley an advance of $1,000 leading to the novelist submitting the first 100 pages. Much of the work had to be rewritten as the publisher was not happy with the initial tone. Benchley worked by winter in his Pennington office, and in the summer in a converted chicken coop in the Wessons' farm in Stonington.&lt;ref name=guardian&gt;{{cite news |last=Hawtree |first=Christopher |url=https://www.theguardian.com/news/2006/feb/14/guardianobituaries.obituaries |title=Peter Benchley |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |date=February 14, 2006 |access-date=February 15, 2011 |publisher=[[Guardian News and Media Limited]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=life/&gt; The idea was inspired by the several great white sharks caught in the 1960s off Long Island and Block Island by the Montauk charterboat captain [[Frank Mundus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Downie |first=Robert M. |title=Block Island History of Photography 1870–1960s |page=243 |volume=2 |year=2008 |oclc=428688552 |url=http://www.preservation.ri.gov/pdfs_zips_downloads/survey_pdfs/blockisland.pdf |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Jaws'' was published in 1974 and became a great success, staying on the bestseller list for 44 weeks. [[Steven Spielberg]], who would direct the film version of  ''Jaws'',  has said that he initially found many of the characters unsympathetic and wanted the shark to win.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Stephen |last=Dowling  |title=The book that spawned a monster |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/arts/3400291.stm |work=[[BBC News]] |date=February 1, 2004 |accessdate=January 1, 2009 |publisher=[[BBC]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Book critics such as [[Michael A. Rogers]] of ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' shared the sentiment but the book struck a chord with readers.

Benchley co-wrote the screenplay with [[Carl Gottlieb]] (along with the uncredited [[Howard Sackler]] and [[John Milius]], who provided the first draft of a monologue about the [[USS Indianapolis (CA-35)|USS ''Indianapolis'']]) for the Spielberg film released in 1975. Benchley made a [[cameo appearance]] as a news reporter on the beach. The film, starring [[Roy Scheider]], [[Robert Shaw (British actor)|Robert Shaw]], and [[Richard Dreyfuss]], was released in the summer season, traditionally considered to be the graveyard season for films. However, [[Universal Studios]] decided to break tradition by releasing the film with extensive television advertising.  It eventually grossed over $470 million worldwide. [[George Lucas]] used a similar strategy in 1977 for ''[[Star Wars (film)|Star Wars]]'' which broke the box office records set by ''Jaws'', and hence the summer [[Blockbuster (entertainment)|blockbuster]] was born.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/film/1653733.stm |title=Rise of the blockbuster |work=[[BBC News]] |date=November 16, 2001 |access-date=August 17, 2012 |publisher=[[BBC]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Benchley estimated that he earned enough from book sales, film rights and magazine/book club syndication to be able to work independently as a film writer for ten years.&lt;ref name=Gale&gt;{{cite web |title=Peter Benchley |work=[[Contemporary Authors]] Online |location=Gale |year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Subsequent career ==
His second novel, ''The Deep'', is about a honeymooning couple discovering two sunken treasures on the Bermuda reefs —  17th century Spanish gold and a fortune in World War II-era morphine — who are subsequently targeted by a drug syndicate. This 1976 novel is based on Benchley's chance meeting in [[Bermuda]] with diver Teddy Tucker while writing a story for ''[[National Geographic (magazine)|National Geographic]]''. Benchley co-wrote the screenplay for the 1977 film release, along with [[Tracy Keenan Wynn]] and an uncredited [[Tom Mankiewicz]]. Directed by [[Peter Yates]] and starring Robert Shaw, [[Nick Nolte]] and [[Jacqueline Bisset]], ''[[The Deep (1977 film)|The Deep]]'' was a box office success, and one of the top 10 highest-grossing films in the US in 1977, though its box office tally fell well short of ''[[Jaws (film)|Jaws]]''.

''The Island'', published in 1979, was a story of descendants of 17th-century [[Piracy|pirates]] who terrorize pleasure craft in the Caribbean, leading to the [[Bermuda Triangle]] mystery. Benchley again wrote the screenplay for the film adaptation. But the film version of ''[[The Island (1980 film)|The Island]]'', starring [[Michael Caine]] and co-starring [[David Warner (actor)|David Warner]], failed at the box office when released in 1980.

During the 1980s, Benchley wrote three novels that did not sell as well as his previous works. However, ''Girl of the Sea of Cortez'', a fable influenced by [[John Steinbeck]] about man's complicated relationship with the sea, was his best-reviewed book and has attracted a considerable cult following since its publication.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} ''Sea of Cortez'' signposted Benchley's growing interest in ecological issues and anticipated his future role as an impassioned advocate of the importance of protecting the marine environment. ''Q Clearance'', published in 1986, was written from his experience as a staffer in the [[Lyndon B. Johnson|Johnson]] [[White House]]. ''Rummies'' (also known as ''Lush''), which appeared in 1989, is a semi-autobiographical work, loosely inspired by the Benchley family's history of alcohol abuse. While the first half of the novel is a relatively straightforward account of a suburbanite's descent into alcoholic hell, the second part, which takes place at a New Mexico substance abuse clinic, is written as a thriller.

He returned to nautical themes in 1991's ''[[Beast (Benchley novel)|Beast]]'' written about a [[giant squid]] threatening Bermuda. ''Beast'' was brought to the small screen as a made-for-television film in 1996, under the title ''[[The Beast (1996 film)|The Beast]]''. His next novel, ''[[White Shark (novel)|White Shark]]'', was published in 1994. The story of a Nazi-created genetically engineered shark/human hybrid, it failed to achieve popular or critical success. It was also turned into a made-for-television film titled ''Creature'', with [[Christopher Lehmann-Haupt]] of the ''New York Times'' saying it "looks more like [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]] than any fish".&lt;ref name=Gale/&gt; Also in 1994, Benchley became the first person to host Discovery Channel's [[Shark Week]].

In 1999, the television show ''[[Amazon (1999 TV series)|Peter Benchley's Amazon]]'' was created, about a group of plane crash survivors in the middle of a vast jungle.

In the last decade of his career, Benchley wrote non-fiction works about the sea and about sharks advocating their conservation. Among these was his book entitled ''Shark Trouble'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Peter Benchley's 'Shark Trouble' |url=https://www.cbsnews.com/news/peter-benchleys-shark-trouble/ |last=Wood |first=Robin |author-link=Robin Wood (critic) |date=28 June 2002 |access-date=12 May 2018 |work=[[CBS News]] |publisher=[[CBS Interactive Inc.]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; which illustrated how hype and news sensationalism can help undermine the public's need to understand marine ecosystems and the potential negative consequences as humans interact with it. This work, which had editions in 2001 and 2003, was written to help a post-''Jaws'' public to more fully understand "the sea in all its beauty, mystery and power."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Benchley |first=Peter |title=Shark Trouble: True Stories and Lessons About the Sea |page=13 |publisher=[[Random House Publishing Group]] |date=4 June 2002 |isbn=9781588362070 |url=https://books.google.es/books?id=5CsIlp4GnrIC&amp;pg=PT7}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It details the ways in which man seems to have become more of an aggressor in his relationship with sharks, acting out of ignorance and greed as several of the species become increasingly threatened by overfishing.

Benchley was a member of the National Council of Environmental Defense and a spokesman for its Oceans Program: "[T]he shark in an updated ''Jaws'' could not be the villain; it would have to be written as the victim; for, worldwide, sharks are much more the oppressed than the oppressors."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.theroyalgazette.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20060217/MIDOCEAN/102170132 |title=Make your company a world wide known name with us! |newspaper=[[The Royal Gazette (Bermuda)|The Royal Gazette]] |date=17 February 2006 |access-date=August 17, 2012 |last=Hodgson |first=Tim |author-link=Tim Hodgson |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060605170033/http://www.theroyalgazette.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20060217/MIDOCEAN/102170132 |archive-date=5 June 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was also one of the founding board members of the Bermuda Underwater Exploration Institute (BUEI).

Benchley died of [[pulmonary fibrosis]] in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/4707576.stm |title=Jaws author Peter Benchley dies |work=[[BBC News]] |date=February 13, 2006 |access-date=August 17, 2012 |publisher=[[BBC]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
In light of Peter Benchley's lifelong record of shark conservation and educating the public about sharks, the Peter Benchley Ocean Awards have been instituted by Wendy Benchley and David Helvarg as his legacy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=About the Awards |website=Peter Benchley Ocean Awards |url=http://peterbenchleyoceanawards.org/awards |access-date=25 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015 researchers confirmed a new species of lanternshark had been found off the Pacific coast of South America, naming it ''[[Ninja lanternshark|Etmopterus benchleyi]]''. Lead researcher Vicki Vásquez noted the author's work in promoting ocean conservation, particlarly sharks, as motivation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.livescience.com/53219-ninja-lantern-shark.html|title=Forget the Flashlight: New Ninja Shark Species Lights up the Sea|work=Live Science|access-date=2018-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Vásquez|first=V.E.|last2=Ebert|first2=D.A.|last3=Long|first3=D.J.|date=|year=2015|orig-year=|editor-last=|others=|title=Etmopterus benchleyi n. sp., a new lanternshark (Squaliformes: Etmopteridae) from the central eastern Pacific Ocean|url=http://www.oceansciencefoundation.org/josf/josf17d.pdf|journal=Journal of the Ocean Science Foundation|volume=17|pages=43-45|doi=|doi-broken-date=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Hindu mythology]], '''sanjeevani''' is a magical [[herbal medicine|herb]] which has the power to cure serious nervous system problems. It was believed that medicines prepared from this herb could revive situations where death is almost certain. The herb is mentioned in the [[Ramayana]] when [[Ravana]]'s son [[Indrajit]] (Meghnad) hurls a powerful weapon at [[Lakshmana]]. Lakshmana is badly wounded and is nearly killed by Indrajit. [[Hanuman]] was called upon to fetch this herb from the mount [[Dunagiri (mountain)|Dronagiri]] (Mahodaya) in the [[Himalayas]]. Upon reaching Dronagiri Parvat, Hanuman could not identify the herb and lifted the whole mountain and brought it to the battlefield.&lt;ref name=search2009&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/science/in-search-of-the-sanjeevani-plant-of-ramayana/article17925.ece |title=In search of the Sanjeevani plant of Ramayana |newspaper=The Hindu|date=11 September 2009|author=D. Balasubramaniam |accessdate= 29 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several plants have been proposed as possible candidates for the sanjeevani plant, including: ''[[Selaginella bryopteris]]'', ''[[Dendrobium plicatile]]'' (synonym ''Desmotrichum fimbriatum''), ''[[Cressa cretica]]'', and others. A search of ancient texts at [[CSIR India|CSIR]] laboratories did not reveal any plant that can be definitively confirmed as sanjeevani. In certain texts it is written that sanjeevani glows in the dark.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.telegraphindia.com/1050929/asp/nation/story_5297959.asp Telegraph India]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.currentscience.ac.in/Downloads/article_id_097_04_0484_0489_0.pdf ''In search of Sanjeevani'', Current Science, Vol. 97, No. 4, 25 August 2009 ]&lt;/ref&gt;

The herb, believed in [[Ayurvedic]] medicine to have medicinal properties,  has been searched for unsuccessfully for centuries, up to modern times.&lt;ref name=search2009 /&gt; The Himalayan state of [[Uttarakhand]] in northern India  committed an initial 250m rupees (£2.8m) of state money to search for ''sanjeevani booti'' starting in August 2016. The search was focused on the [[Dronagiri]] range of the [[Himalayas]] near the Chinese border. The [[Ramayana]] mentions a mountain believed to refer to the Dronagiri range, where the magical herb is supposed to grow. Uttarakhand established a Department of Ayurveda, Yoga and Naturopathy, Unani, Siddha and Homoeopathy (Ayush) in November 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jul/28/indian-state-uttarakhand-hunts-mythical-glow-in-the-dark-plant |title=Indian state steps up hunt for mythical glow-in-the dark plant |newspaper=The Guardian |date=29 July 2016  |author=Agence France-Presse |accessdate= 29 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sarsen''' stones are sandstone blocks found in quantity in the United Kingdom on [[Salisbury Plain]] and the [[Marlborough Downs]] in Wiltshire; in [[Kent]]; and in smaller quantities in [[Berkshire]], [[Essex]], [[Oxfordshire]], [[Dorset]] and [[Hampshire]]. They are the post-glacial&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cityofwinchester.co.uk/history/html/sarsens.html Sarsen stones in Winchester] at a travel guide website for Winchester, Hampshire&lt;/ref&gt; remains of a cap of [[Cenozoic]] [[silcrete]] that once covered much of southern England &amp;ndash; a dense, hard rock created from [[sand]] bound by a [[silica]] cement, making it a kind of silicified sandstone. This is thought to have formed during [[Neogene]] to [[Quaternary]] [[weathering]] by the silicification of Upper [[Paleocene]] [[Lambeth Group]] sediments, resulting from acid leaching.&lt;ref name="Stewart Ullyot"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Stewart Ullyot|first=J. |author2=Nash D.J. |author3=Whiteman C.A.  |author4=Mortimore R.N.|year=2004|title=Distribution, petrology and mode of development of silcretes (sarsens and puddingstones) on the eastern South Downs, UK|journal=[[Earth Surface Processes and Landforms]]|volume=29|issue=12|doi=10.1002/esp.1136|bibcode = 2004ESPL...29.1509U }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The word "sarsen" (pronunciation ['sa:sǝn]) is a shortening of "Saracen stone" which arose in the [[Wiltshire dialect]]. "[[Saracen]]" was a common name for [[Muslim]]s, and came  by extension to be used for anything regarded as non-Christian, whether Muslim, pagan Celtic, or other.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Stevens|first1=Frank|title=Stonehenge|url=http://www.sarsen.org/2011_08_01_archive.html|website=www.sarsen.org|accessdate=4 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Human uses==
The builders of [[Stonehenge]] used these stones for the heelstone and sarsen circle uprights.&lt;ref&gt;Bruce Bedlam ''[http://www.stonehenge.tv/stones.html The stones of Stonehenge]''&lt;/ref&gt; [[Avebury]]&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.sacredsites.com/europe/england/avebury.html Stone ring of Avebury]'' at Places of Peace and Power website&lt;/ref&gt; and many other [[megalith]]ic monuments in southern England are also built with sarsen stones.

Fire and in later times explosives were sometimes employed to break the stone into pieces of a suitable size for use in construction. Sarsen is not an ideal building material, however. [[William Stukeley]] wrote that sarsen is "always moist and dewy in winter which proves damp and unwholesome, and rots the furniture". In the case of [[Avebury]], the investors who backed a scheme to recycle the stone were bankrupted when the houses they built proved to be unsaleable and also prone to burning down. However, despite these problems, sarsen remained highly prized for its durability, being a favoured material for steps and [[Curb (road)|kerb]] stones.

'''''Scheitholz''''' is a German term for log sections that have been split lengthways with an [[axe]] or [[log splitter]] and that are primarily used for [[firewood]] or the manufacture of [[wood shingle]]s. The individual pieces of timber are called '''''Holzscheite''''' (obs.: ''Holzscheiter''), derived from the [[Old High German]] word ''scît'' = "piece". [[Wood gasification boiler|''Scheitholz'' boilers]] are used to burn quantities of ''Scheithölzer''. The expression ''"auf Scheitholz knien''" ("to kneel on ''scheitholz'') was a disciplinary measure used in times when [[corporal punishment in schools]] was still permitted.&lt;ref&gt;c.f. Anonymus: ''Hat der Schulmeister Brod? oder Ich bin Schulpatron'', Text eines Lustspiels, Prague and Leipzig by Caspar Widtmann 1786, [https://books.google.at/books?id=i9hJAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA72&amp;lpg=PA72&amp;dq=Scheitholzknien&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=kMmRw93Qtg&amp;sig=kxyCP9bp9yag1tLbwfK3RxKW8yo&amp;hl=de&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=z_VgUJLmB6Gp4gT1o4H4BA&amp;ved=0CCIQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Scheitholzknien&amp;f=false viewable online at Google Books].&lt;/ref&gt;

Very thinly split timber is also called '''''Spanholz''''' or '''''Span''''', roughly the same as long-fibred [[Woodchips|wood chip]]s or [[wood shaving]]s, which may also be a waste by-product of the processes of [[planning]] or [[hewing]] wood. ''Span'' may also refer, however, to long-fibred slips or slices of wood especially of [[Populus|poplar]] and other softwoods, which are used to make wooden [[punnet]]s and fruit or vegetable [[crates]].

===Park history===
Sea World was founded by Keith Williams in 1958. It was originally known as the Surfers Paradise Ski Gardens, which presented "water ski shows that combined comedy, aqua ballet and action". In 1971, the Surfers Paradise Ski Gardens moved to land on the Spit. Major dredging works were required to build the new ski lake. A year later, the Surfers Paradise Ski Gardens became known as Sea World with the introduction of dolphins, marine displays, a replica of the Endeavour, a swimming pool, licensed restaurant and gift shop. Extra additions over the next decade included the purchasing of competitor marine park, Marineland, and the transfer of animals and exhibits to Sea World as well as the addition of more shops and food outlets.&lt;ref name="history"&gt;History and Development – Sea World. Retrieved from the [http://seaworld.myfun.com.au/Schools/Project-Information/History-and-Development.htm official website].&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1984 Keith Williams sold the park to Pivot Leisure. Later in 1988 Pivot built the 400 room Sea World Nara Resort. In 1991 Pivot Leisure, Warner Bros. and Village Roadshow jointly developed and opened Warner Bros. Movie World, a Hollywood theme action park, at Oxenford on the Gold Coast. Also that year Pivot Purchased Wet n' Wild Water park located next to the site of Warner Bros. Movie World. In 1993, Warner Bros. and Village Roadshow jointly acquired Pivot Leisure's interest in Warner Bros. Movie World, Sea World and the adjoining Sea World Nara Resort.

==On society==
In July 2013, media critic [[Jay Rosen]] defined the Snowden effect as "Direct and indirect gains in public knowledge from the cascade of events and further reporting that followed Edward Snowden's leaks of classified information about the surveillance state in the U.S."&lt;ref name=RosenSnowdenEffect&gt;{{cite web |last=Rosen |first=Jay |title=The Snowden Effect: definition and examples |url=http://pressthink.org/2013/07/the-snowden-effect-definition-and-examples/ |work=Jay Rosen's PressThink |accessdate=February 18, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2013, ''[[The Nation]]'' wrote that Snowden had sparked an overdue debate about national security and individual privacy.&lt;ref name=NationSnowdenEffect&gt;{{cite web |last=Alterman |first=Eric |title=What the Press Should Learn From the 'Snowden Effect' |url=http://www.thenation.com/blog/177686/what-press-should-learn-snowden-effect# |work=The Nation |accessdate=March 2, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the 2014 [[World Economic Forum]], Internet experts saw news that [[Microsoft]] would let foreign customers store their personal data on servers outside America as a sign that Snowden's leaks were leading countries and companies to erect borders in cyberspace.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Davos |first=L.S. |title=The Snowden effect |url=https://www.economist.com/blogs/babbage/2014/01/internet-governance |work=The Economist |accessdate=March 2, 2014 |date=January 24, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[Forbes]]'', the effect was seen to have nearly united the U.S. Congress in opposition to the massive [[post-9/11]] domestic intelligence gathering system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Watson |first=Tom |title=The Snowden Effect Hits Congress: Will Effective Crowdsourced Lobbying Follow? |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/tomwatson/2013/07/18/the-snowden-effect-hits-congress-will-effective-crowdsourced-lobbying-follow/ |work=Forbes |accessdate=March 2, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In its Spring 2014 Global Attitudes Survey, the [[Pew Research Center]] found that Snowden's disclosures had tarnished the image of the United States, especially in Europe and Latin America.&lt;ref name=PewJuly2014&gt;{{Cite journal |url=http://www.pewglobal.org/2014/07/14/global-opposition-to-u-s-surveillance-and-drones-but-limited-harm-to-americas-image/ |title=Global Opposition to U.S. Surveillance and Drones, but Limited Harm to America's Image |publisher=Pew Research Center |date=July 14, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2014, the Obama administration appointed [[William Evanina]], a former FBI special agent with a [[counter-terrorism]] specialty, as the new government-wide [[Office of the National Counterintelligence Executive|National Counterintelligence Executive]]. "Instead of getting carried away with the concept of leakers as heroes," Evanina said in August, "we need to get back to the basics of what it means to be loyal. Undifferentiated, unauthorized leaking is a criminal act." While dealing with insider threats had been an intelligence community priority since WikiLeaks published Chelsea Manning's disclosures in 2010, Evanina said that in the aftermath of Snowden's June 2013 revelations, the process "sped up from a regional railway to the [[Acela Express|Acela]] train." A year later, 100,000 fewer people had security clearances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Clark |first=Charles S. |title=Meet the Man Who's Gauging the Damage From Snowden |url=http://www.govexec.com/management/2014/08/meet-man-whos-gauging-damage-snowden/91595/ |work=Government Executive |date=August 15, 2014 |accessdate=April 11, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2014, [[Director of National Intelligence]] [[James Clapper]] said Snowden's leaks created a [[perfect storm]], degrading the intelligence community's capabilities. Snowden's leaks, said Clapper, damaged relationships with foreign and corporate stakeholders, restrained budget resources, and caused the U.S. to discontinue collecting intelligence on certain targets, putting the United States at greater risk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Sink |first=Justin |title=Intelligence chief says Snowden leaks created 'perfect storm' |url=http://thehill.com/policy/technology/218155-intelligence-chief-says-snowden-leaks-created-perfect-storm |work=The Hill |date=September 18, 2014 |accessdate=April 11, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2014, former Director of the [[National Counterterrorism Center]] [[Matthew G. Olsen]] told [[CNN]] that Snowden's disclosures had made it easier for terrorist groups to evade U.S. surveillance by changing their encryption methods. Olsen said intelligence collection against some individuals of concern had been lost, preventing insight into their activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Liptak |first=Kevin |title=Ex-counterterror chief: U.S. lost track of terrorists after Snowden |url=http://www.cnn.com/2014/10/21/politics/olsen-nsa/index.html |publisher=CNN |date=October 21, 2014 |accessdate=April 11, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; By July 2015 [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant|ISIL]] had studied Snowden's disclosures and, said U.S. officials, its leaders were using couriers or encrypted communications that Western analysts could not crack.&lt;ref&gt;[[Eric P. Schmitt]] and Ben Hubbard (July 20, 2015) [https://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/21/world/middleeast/isis-strategies-include-lines-of-succession-and-deadly-ring-tones.html ISIS Leader Takes Steps to Ensure Group's Survival] ''[[The New York Times]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2015, [[National Counterterrorism Center]] director [[Nicholas Rasmussen]] told Congress that Snowden's disclosures had damaged U.S. intelligence capabilities. Rasmussen said the government knew of specific terrorists who, after learning from Snowden's leaks how the U.S. collected intelligence, had increased their security measures by using new types of encryption, changing email addresses, or abandoning prior methods of communicating.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Aftergood |first=Steven |title=Leaks Damaged U.S. Intelligence, Official Says |url=https://fas.org/blogs/secrecy/2015/02/leaks-damaged/ |publisher=Federation of American Scientists |date=February 17, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reflecting on the effect of his leaks, Snowden himself wrote in February 2015 that "the biggest change has been in awareness. Before 2013, if you said the NSA was making records of everybody's phonecalls and the [[Government Communications Headquarters|GCHQ]] was monitoring lawyers and journalists, people raised eyebrows and called you a conspiracy theorist. Those days are over."&lt;ref name=RedditAMA&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2wwdep/we_are_edward_snowden_laura_poitras_and_glenn/ |title=We are Edward Snowden, Laura Poitras and Glenn Greenwald from the Oscar-winning documentary CITIZENFOUR |website=Reddit |accessdate=February 25, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2015, ''[[USA Today]]'' reported that the Snowden effect had hit ''[[The Guardian]]''. Journalist [[Michael Wolff (journalist)|Michael Wolff]], who wrote for ''The Guardian'' for many years, asserted that the recent selection of [[Katharine Viner]] as editor-in-chief "can be read as, in part, a deeply equivocal response on the part of the paper's staff, with its unusual power in the process of selecting a new editor, to the Snowden story." According to Wolff, there had developed "a sense of journalistic queasiness around Snowden, difficult to express at the party-line ''Guardian''. Questioning Snowden's retreat to Russia and his protection by Vladimir Putin was internally verboten."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/columnist/wolff/2015/03/20/new-editor-for-guardian-newspaper/25094233/ |title=Snowden effect hits 'Guardian' |work=USA Today |date=March 20, 2015 |accessdate=March 26, 2015 |first=Michael |last=Wolff}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Technology industry==
In the technology industry, the Snowden effect had a profound impact after it was revealed that the NSA was tapping into the information held by some U.S. [[Cloud computing|cloud-based services]]. [[Google]], [[Cisco]], and [[AT&amp;T]] lost business internationally due to the public outcry over their roles in NSA spying. A study by the [[Information Technology and Innovation Foundation]] published in August 2013 estimated that the cloud-based computing industry could have lost up to $35 billion by 2016.&lt;ref name=HuffPoCisco&gt;{{cite news |last=Smith |first=Gerry |title='Snowden Effect' Threatens U.S. Tech Industry's Global Ambitions |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/01/24/edward-snowden-tech-industry_n_4596162.html |work=Huffington Post |accessdate=February 1, 2014 |date=January 24, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Wall Street Journal'' named "the Snowden effect" as 2013's top tech story, saying Snowden's leaks "taught businesses that the convenience of the cloud cuts both ways." The ''Journal'' predicted the effect would top 2014 news as well, given the number of documents yet to be revealed.&lt;ref name=WSJ2013TechNews&gt;{{cite news |last=Boulton |first=Clint |title=Snowden Effect Dominates 2013 Tech Industry News |url=https://blogs.wsj.com/cio/2013/12/26/snowden-effect-dominates-2013-tech-industry-news/ |work=The Wall Street Journal |accessdate=February 1, 2014 |date=December 26, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In China, the most profitable country for U.S. tech companies, all are "under suspicion as either witting or unwitting collaborators" in the NSA spying, according to the director of the Research Center for Chinese Politics and Business at Indiana University.&lt;ref name=ReutersSnowdenEffect&gt;{{cite news |last=Miller |first=Matthew |title=In China, U.S. tech firms weigh 'Snowden Effect' |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2014/01/21/us-ibm-china-idUSBREA0K0FB20140121 |agency=Reuters |accessdate=February 1, 2014 |date=January 21, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The effect was also seen in changes to investment in the industry, with security "back on the map" according to Hussein Kanji, Venture Capitalist at Hoxton Ventures.&lt;ref name=BloombergSnowdenEffect /&gt;

On August 8, 2013, [[Lavabit#Connection to Edward Snowden|Lavabit]], a secure email provider that Snowden used, discontinued service after being asked for encryption keys that would have exposed to U.S. government prosecutors the emails of all 410,000 Lavabit users.&lt;ref name="nytimes-lavabit-closes"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/03/us/snowdens-e-mail-provider-discusses-pressure-from-fbi-to-disclose-data.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=1&amp; |title=As F.B.I.

Since Snowden's disclosures, Americans used the Internet less for things like email, online shopping and banking, according to an April 2014 poll.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Harris Poll: People Cutting Back Internet Use After Snowden |url=http://www.newsmax.com/US/Snowden-Internet-Harris-poll/2014/04/04/id/563768/ |accessdate=April 6, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Post Snowden, Some Internet Usage Is Contracting, Study Finds |url=https://blogs.wsj.com/cio/2014/04/03/post-snowden-some-internet-usage-is-contracting-study-finds/ |accessdate=April 6, 2014 |work=The Wall Street Journal |date=April 3, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also in April 2014, former NSA deputy director Col. Cedric Leighton told the Bloomberg Enterprise Technology Summit in New York City that Snowden's leaks had performed a significant disservice to the worldwide health of the Internet by leading Brazil and other countries to reconsider the Internet's decentralized nature. Leighton suggested that nation states' efforts to create their own versions of the Internet were the beginning of the end for the Internet as we know it. "When you have a situation where all of a sudden, everyone goes into 'tribal' mode—a German cloud, a Swiss cloud, or any other separate Internet—they are significant nationalistic attempts," said Leighton. "What happened with Snowden, it's more of an excuse than a policy, it's more of an excuse to re-nationalize the Internet."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Former NSA deputy director: Snowden leaks caused 'significant disservice' to the Internet |url=http://www.zdnet.com/former-nsa-deputy-director-snowden-leaks-caused-significant-disservice-to-the-Internet-7000028746/ |accessdate=April 25, 2014 |work=ZDNet |date=April 24, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2014, ''[[The New York Times]]'' reported that economic fallout from Snowden's leaks had been a boon for foreign companies, to the detriment of U.S. firms. Daniel Castro, a senior analyst at the [[Information Technology and Innovation Foundation]], predicted that the United States cloud computing industry could lose $35 billion by 2016. Matthias Kunisch, a German software executive who switched from U.S. cloud computing providers to [[Deutsche Telekom]], said that due to Snowden his customers thought American companies had connections to the NSA. Security analysts estimated that U.S. tech companies had since Snowden collectively spent millions and possibly billions of dollars adding state-of-the-art encryption features to consumer services and to the cables that link data centers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/22/business/fallout-from-snowden-hurting-bottom-line-of-tech-companies.html |title=Revelations of N.S.A.

In July 2014, the nonpartisan [[New America Foundation]] summarized the impact of Snowden's revelations on U.S. businesses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://oti.newamerica.net/sites/newamerica.net/files/policydocs/Surveillance_Costs_Short%20Version.pdf |title=Surveillance Costs: The NSA's Impact on the Economy, Internet Freedom &amp; Cybersecurity |website=newamerica.net |date=Summer 2014 |accessdate=September 30, 2014 |publisher=[[New America Foundation]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140912153658/http://oti.newamerica.net/sites/newamerica.net/files/policydocs/Surveillance_Costs_Short%20Version.pdf |archivedate=September 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The erosion of trust, said the report, has had serious consequences for U.S. tech firms. [[Information technology|IT]] executives in France, Hong Kong, Germany, the UK, and the U.S. confirmed that Snowden's leaks directly impacted how companies around the world think about information and communication technologies, particularly cloud computing. A quarter of British and Canadian multinational companies surveyed were moving their data outside the U.S. Among U.S. companies attributing drops in revenue to, in part, fallout from Snowden's leaks were [[Cisco Systems]], [[Qualcomm]], [[IBM]], [[Microsoft]], and [[Hewlett-Packard]]. Proposed laws in more than a dozen foreign countries, including Germany, Brazil, and India, would make it harder for U.S. firms to do business there. The European Union is considering stricter domestic privacy legislation that could result in fines and penalties costing U.S. firms billions of dollars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://blogs.wsj.com/digits/2014/07/30/new-report-snowden-revelations-hurt-u-s-companies/ |title=New Report: Snowden Revelations Hurt U.S. Companies |date=July 30, 2014 |newspaper=[[The Wall Street Journal]] |first=Elizabeth |last=Dwoskin}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2014, [[Massachusetts]]-based [[web intelligence]] firm [[Recorded Future]] announced it had found a direct connection between Snowden's leaks and dramatic changes in how Islamist terrorists interacted online.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.recordedfuture.com/al-qaeda-encryption-technology-part-2/|title=How Al-Qaeda Uses Encryption Post-Snowden (Part 2)|date=August 1, 2014|website=Recorded Future|accessdate=December 5, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=NPRchanged&gt;{{cite web |last=Temple-Raston |first=Dina |title=Big Data Firm Says It Can Link Snowden Data To Changed Terrorist Behavior |url=https://www.npr.org/blogs/thetwo-way/2014/08/01/336958020/big-data-firm-says-it-can-link-snowden-data-to-changed-terrorist-behavior |publisher=NPR |date=August 1, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; (In 2010, the privately held Recorded Future received an investment from [[In-Q-Tel]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=IQT Portfolio |url=https://www.iqt.org/iqt_portfolio/recorded-future/ |publisher=In-Q-Tel |accessdate=February 10, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; a nonprofit [[venture capital]] firm whose primary partner is the [[CIA]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=About IQT |url=https://www.iqt.org/about-iqt/#partners |publisher=In-Q-Tel |accessdate=February 10, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;) Just months after Snowden's 2013 leaks, said Recorded Future, operatives of [[al-Qaeda]] and associated groups completely overhauled their 7-year-old encryption methods, which included "homebrewed" algorithms, adopting instead more sophisticated [[open-source software]] and newly available downloads that enabled encryption on [[Mobile phone|cellphones]], [[Android (operating system)|Android products]], and [[Macintosh|Macs]], to help disguise their communications.&lt;ref name=NPRchanged /&gt;

In September 2014, [[Seattle]]-based [[Deep Web (search indexing)|Deep Web]] and [[Dark web]] monitoring firm Flashpoint Global Partners published a report that found "very little open source information available via [[Jihadism|jihadi]] online [[social media]]" indicating that Snowden's leaks impelled al-Qaeda to develop more secure digital communications. "The underlying public encryption methods employed by online jihadists," the report concluded, "do not appear to have significantly changed since the emergence of Edward Snowden. Major recent technological advancements have focused primarily on expanding the use of encryption to instant messenger and mobile communications mediums."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Measuring the Impact of the Snowden Leaks on the Use of Encryption by Online Jihadists |url=https://fpjintel.com/public-reports/measuring-the-impact-of-the-snowden-leaks-on-the-use-of-encryption-by-online-jihadists/ |publisher=Flashpoint Partners |date=September 16, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2015, ''[[The Nation]]'' reported, "The fallout from the Edward Snowden fiasco wasn't just political—it was largely economic. Soon after the extent of the NSA's data collection became public, overseas customers (including the Brazilian government) started abandoning U.S.-based tech companies in droves over privacy concerns. The dust hasn't settled yet, but tech-research firm [[Forrester Research|Forrester]] estimated the losses may total 'as high as $180 billion,' or 25 percent of industry revenue."&lt;ref name=Capello01a&gt;{{cite web |last=Cappello |first=Lawrence |title=Privacy and the Profit Motive |url=http://www.thenation.com/article/205953/privacy-and-profit-motive |work=The Nation |date=May 4, 2015 |accessdate=May 4, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Consumer products==
In September 2014, ''The New York Times'' credited [[Apple Inc.|Apple Inc.'s]] update of [[iOS 8]], which encrypts all data inside it, as demonstrating how Snowden's impact had begun to work its way into consumer products. His revelations, said ''The Times'', "not only killed recent efforts to expand the law, but also made nations around the world suspicious that every piece of American hardware and software—from phones to servers made by [[Cisco Systems]]—have 'back doors' for American intelligence and law enforcement." ''The Times'' situated this development within a "Post Snowden Era" in which Apple would no longer comply with NSA and law enforcement requests for user data, instead maintaining that Apple doesn't possess the key to unlock data on the [[iPhone]]. However, since the new security protects information stored on the device itself, but not data stored on Apple's [[iCloud]] service, Apple will still be able to obtain some customer information stored on iCloud in response to government requests. ''The Times'' added that [[Google|Google's]] [[Android (operating system)|Android]] would have encryption enabled by default in upcoming versions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Sanger |first1=David E. |last2=Chen |first2=Brian X. |title=Signaling Post-Snowden Era, New iPhone Locks Out N.S.A. |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/27/technology/iphone-locks-out-the-nsa-signaling-a-post-snowden-era-.html |work=The New York Times |date=September 26, 2014 |accessdate=April 11, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3553">The '''Spite plateau''' (or '''Spite lithium plateau''') is a baseline in the abundance of [[lithium]] found in old stars orbiting the galactic halo. It was named after the astronomers François and Monique Spite, who published the discovery in 1982.&lt;ref name=coc_vangioni2005/&gt;

The element lithium was first produced during the [[Big Bang]] that created the [[observable universe]].  The cosmic abundance of lithium is of interest because it provides several constraints to the various Big Bang models.&lt;ref name=aaa115_2_357/&gt; Those models that fail to satisfy these constraints are therefore subject to rejection or correction by the scientific community.

Lithium is readily consumed by fusion with protons at temperatures above {{nowrap|2 × 10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; [[Kelvin|K]]}}, such as is found in the cores of stars. Thus, if the [[convection zone]] of a [[main sequence]] star carries lithium to the core region, the abundance of lithium in the star can decrease. Likewise, lithium can be produced in [[interstellar matter]] by spallation collisions with [[cosmic ray]]s, or by the evolution of stars of moderate mass.&lt;ref name=aaa115_2_357/&gt;

To obtain a good estimate of the primordial abundance of lithium, astronomers François and Monique Spite measured the abundance of lithium in old, [[population II stars]] (or old halo stars). Such stars were formed early in the universe out of material that had not been significantly modified by other processes. Their results showed that the curve on a graph of the abundance of lithium versus effective surface temperature formed a plateau among old halo stars for effective temperatures below about:
: log ''T''&lt;sub&gt;eff&lt;/sub&gt; ~ 3.75
or roughly 5,600&amp;nbsp;K. This suggested that the plateau represented the primordial abundance level of lithium in the [[Milky Way]], and thus they were able to estimate that the abundance of lithium at the beginning of the galaxy was:
: ''N''&lt;sub&gt;Li&lt;/sub&gt; = (11.2 ± 3.8) × 10&lt;sup&gt;−11&lt;/sup&gt; ''N''&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt;
where ''N''&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt; is the abundance of hydrogen.&lt;ref name=aaa115_2_357/&gt;

The current estimates for the primordial abundance of lithium, as measured by this technique, are in tension with the predictions of the standard model of [[Big Bang nucleosynthesis]], a discrepancy known as the Lithium Problem.&lt;ref name=fields12/&gt;

[[File:Himawari-8 Summer Solstice Midnight 2017.jpg|thumb|The Earth during the summer solstice in June 2017]]
The '''summer solstice''' (or '''estival solstice'''), also known as '''[[midsummer]]''', occurs when one of the Earth's [[geographical pole|poles]] has its maximum tilt toward the Sun. It happens twice yearly, once in each [[Hemispheres of Earth|hemisphere]] (Northern and Southern). For that hemisphere, the summer solstice is when the Sun reaches its [[culmination|highest position]] in the sky and is the day with the longest period of daylight. At the pole, there is [[Midnight sun|continuous daylight]] around the summer solstice. On the summer solstice, Earth's maximum [[axial tilt]] toward the Sun is 23.44°. Likewise, the Sun's [[declination]] from the [[celestial equator]] is 23.44°.

The summer solstice occurs during the hemisphere's [[summer]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/learning/learn-about-the-weather/how-weather-works/when-does-spring-start&lt;/ref&gt;  This is the [[June solstice]] in the [[Northern Hemisphere]] and the [[December solstice]] in the [[Southern Hemisphere]]. Depending on the shift of the calendar, the summer solstice occurs sometime between June 20 and June 22 in the Northern Hemisphere&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.timeanddate.com/calendar/june-solstice.html |title=The June Solstice |publisher=Time and Date AS |date= |accessdate=2012-01-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/553654/solstice |title=Solstice (astronomy) |publisher=Britannica Online Encyclopedia |date= |accessdate=2011-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; and between December 20 and December 23 in the Southern Hemisphere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.timeanddate.com/calendar/december-solstice.html |title=December Solstice |publisher=Time and Date AS |date= |accessdate=2012-01-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same dates in the opposite hemisphere are referred to as the [[winter solstice]]. 

Since prehistory, the summer solstice has been seen as a significant time of year in many cultures, and has been marked by festivals and rituals. Traditionally, in many [[Temperate climate|temperate]] regions (especially Europe), the summer solstice is seen as the middle of summer and referred to as "midsummer". Today, however, in some countries and calendars it is seen as the beginning of summer.

==Distinctions==
[[File:north season.jpg|thumb|Diagram of the [[Earth]]'s seasons as seen from the north. Far left: summer [[solstice]] for the Northern Hemisphere. Front right: summer solstice for the Southern Hemisphere.]]
Although the summer solstice is the longest day of the year for that hemisphere, the dates of earliest sunrise and latest sunset vary by a few days.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://aa.usno.navy.mil/faq/docs/rs_solstices.php |title=US Naval Observatory: Sunrise and Sunset Times Near the Solstices |access-date=21 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is because the earth orbits the sun in an ellipse, and its orbital speed varies slightly during the year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://aa.usno.navy.mil/faq/docs/rs_solstices.php#long |title=The Long Story (USNO explanation) |access-date=21 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; See the [[Equation of time]] for details.
Although the sun appears at its highest altitude from the viewpoint of an observer in outer space or a terrestrial observer outside tropical latitudes, the highest altitude occurs on a different day for certain locations in the tropics, specifically those where the sun is directly overhead (maximum 90 degrees elevation) at the [[subsolar point]]. This day occurs twice each year for all locations between the [[Tropic of Cancer]] and [[Tropic of Capricorn]] because the overhead sun appears to cross a given latitude once before the day of the solstice and once afterward. For example, [[Lahaina Noon]] occurs in May and July in Hawaii. See [[solstice]] article.
For all observers, the apparent position of the noon sun is at its most northerly point on the June solstice and most southerly on the December solstice.

==Full moon==
2016 was the first time in nearly 70 years that a full moon and the [[Northern Hemisphere]]'s summer solstice occurred on the same day.&lt;ref name="Rare Occurrence"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.almanac.com/content/first-day-summer-2016-summer-solstice |title=Full Moon and Summer Solstice coincide on the same day |last= |first= |date= |work=[[Old Farmer's Almanac|The Old Farmer's Almanac]] |access-date=21 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 2016 summer solstice's full moon rose just as the sun set.&lt;ref name="Rare Occurrence"/&gt;

==Cultural aspects==
{{main article|Midsummer}}
The significance given to the summer solstice has varied among cultures, but most recognize the event in some way with [[holiday]]s, [[festival]]s, and [[ritual]]s around that time with themes of religion or fertility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.religioustolerance.org/summer_solstice.htm |title=Summer solstice celebrations of Christianity, Judaism, Neopaganism, etc |publisher=Religioustolerance.org |date= |accessdate=2011-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In some regions, the summer solstice is seen as the beginning of [[summer]] and the end of [[spring (season)|spring]].  In other cultural conventions, the solstice is closer to the middle of summer.&lt;ref&gt;http://weather.about.com/od/climatechange/fl/Astronomical-vs-Meteorological-Seasons.htm&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Summer Solstice Sunset 06-20-16.jpg|thumb|right|[[Summer]] [[solstice]] [[sunset]] over the [[Mojave Desert]] 7:54 p.m. PDT (19:54)  June 20, 2016]]

''Solstice'' is derived from the [[Latin]] words ''sol'' (sun) and ''sistere'' (to stand still).

==Date==
[[File:Gregoriancalendarleap solstice.svg|nome|800px|Date of the northern hemisphere's summer solstice over time. The ~25 drops per century are leap years when the date shifts back one day due to the insertion of February 29.  There was no leap year in 1800 or 1900, which explains why there is no drop those years.]]

A '''valve audio amplifier''' ([[UK]]) or '''vacuum tube audio amplifier''' ([[United States]]) is a [[valve amplifier]] used for [[sound reinforcement]], [[sound recording and reproduction]].

Until the invention of [[Solid state (electronics)|solid state]] devices such as the [[transistor]], all electronic amplification was produced by [[thermionic valve|valve (tube)]] amplifiers. While solid-state devices prevail in most audio amplifiers today, valve audio amplifiers are still used where their [[Valve sound|audible characteristics]] are considered pleasing, for example in music performance or music reproduction.

==Instrument and vocal amplification==
Valve amplifiers for guitars (and to a lesser degree vocals and other applications) have different purposes from those of hi-fi amplifiers. The purpose is not necessarily to reproduce sound as accurately as possible, but rather to fulfill the musician's concept of what the sound should be. For example, distortion is almost universally considered undesirable in hi-fi amplifiers but may be considered a desirable characteristic in performance.

Small signal circuits are often deliberately designed to have very high [[Gain (electronics)|gain]], driving the signal far outside the linear range of the tube circuit, to deliberately generate large amounts of harmonic distortion. The distortion and overdrive characteristics of valves are quite different from transistors (not least the amount of voltage headroom available in a typical circuit) and this results in a distinctive sound. Amplifiers for such performance applications typically retain tone and filter circuits that have largely disappeared from modern hi-fi products. Amplifiers for guitars in particular may also include a number of "effects" functions.

===The origins of electric guitar amplification===
The electric guitar originates from Rickenbacker in the 1930s but its modern form was popularised by [[Fender Musical Instruments Corporation|Fender]] and [[Gibson Guitar Corporation|Gibson]] (notably the [[Fender Telecaster]] (1951) &amp; [[Stratocaster]] (1954) and [[Gibson Les Paul]] (1952) during the 1950s. The earliest [[guitar amplifier]]s were probably audio amplifiers made for other purposes and pressed into service, but the electric guitar and its amplification quickly developed a life of its own, supported by specialist manufacturers.

[[File:Trace Elliot Bonneville rear view.jpg|thumb|300px|Rear view of a valve combo guitar amplifier. Visible are two glass 6L6 output tubes, six smaller 12AX7 preamp tubes in their metal tube retainers and both the power transformer and the output transformer.]]

Guitar amplifiers are often designed so they can, when desired by the guitarist, distort and create a tone rich in harmonics and overtones. The characteristics of the tube and the circuit directly influence the nature of the sound produced. Even the power supply can influence the tonal shape, with relatively undersized power supply capacitors producing a characteristic "sag" at instants of peak output and power draw, and subsequent recovery, that is often considered musically engaging.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ampbooks.com/home/classic-circuits/class-AB-ripple/]&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, guitarists may employ acoustic feedback, further modifying the resulting sound (noting that the feedback signal has a slight time lag relative to the original signal).

Guitar amplifiers are typically designed to withstand a lot of abuse both electrically and physically (since guitarists often travel to gigs, etc.) In large systems the amplifier is separate from the speaker enclosure(s), but in smaller systems it is often integrated, forming a so-called "combo". Since the amplifier is usually at the top of the combo, the tubes often hang upside down facing the body of the enclosure. They may be held in with clips.

Most modern valve guitar amplifiers use a class AB1 push-pull circuit with a pair of power pentodes or beam tetrodes, [[6L6]] or [[EL34]] but occasionally [[KT88]], [[6550]], or the lower-power [[EL84]]  in ''[[Ultra-Linear]]'' connection. The output stage is preceded by a voltage amplification stage (pentode or twin triode) and a phase-splitter (twin triode). Twin triodes with two identical sections in one envelope are used, usually the noval types [[12AT7]], [[12AU7]], or [[12AX7]] or equivalents, less usually the octal [[6SN7]].

==Amplifiers for sound reproduction==

===Early development===
The earliest mass usage of valve audio amplifiers was for telephony. Valve amplifiers were critical in development of long-distance telephone circuits and [[submarine telephone cable]]s. Radio applications followed soon after, where valves were used for both the audio (AF) and radio (RF) circuitry. (RF is outside the scope of this article, see [[valve amplifier]]).

Among the first applications of sound recording and electronic replay around the 1920s was its use in many cinemas equipping for exhibiting the new '[[talkies]]'. Cinema sound systems of this period were predominantly supplied by "Westrex", related to the Western Electric company, a telecoms supplier, who were also the makers of the 300B DHT tube that today is central to current production DH-SET [[audiophile]] amplification.

Amplifiers during this period typically used '''D'''irectly '''H'''eated tubes in a Class A '''S'''ingle-'''E'''nded '''T'''riode circuit. Power output ranged from a few watts to perhaps 20 watts for an exceptionally powerful amplifier (modern semiconductor amplifiers produce much higher power). Today this type of circuit retains a niche following at the very extreme of audiophile hi-fi, where it is often referred as DH-SET.

Prior to WWII, almost all electronic amplifiers were triodes used without feedback. The inherent, albeit imperfect, linearity of tubes makes it possible to get acceptable distortion performance without correction. Amplitude distortion in a class A triode stage can be small if care is taken to prevent the anode current from becoming too small and ensuring that grid current does not flow at any point. In this case, distortion is largely relatively unobjectionable second harmonic, with percentage closely proportional to the output amplitude. Adding modest negative feedback improves linearity further. Pentodes of the same power dissipation are capable of higher output power than triodes, but distortion is higher and more objectionable.

===The 1940s and 1950s===
During the post-war period, widespread adoption of [[negative feedback]] in the push pull topology yielded greater power and linearity, notably following the publication in 1947 of the [[Williamson amplifier]], which set the standard (and the dominant topology) for what was to follow.

Widespread adoption of push pull allowed smaller (and thus cheaper) transformers,{{Citation needed|date=April 2012}} combined with more power (typically 10 to 20 watts) to handle peaks. The [[high fidelity]] industry was born.

Other developments included (among others):
* the introduction of the "Point One" series of amplifiers (in 1945) by [[LEAK]] in the UK, which first set a performance standard of 0.1% THD
* the [[Ultra-Linear]] output stage (a tapped push-pull output transformer providing power intermediate between triodes and pentodes, at lower distortion than either) was originated by [[Alan Blumlein]] in 1937 in the UK, but popularised following publication of a paper by [[David Hafler]] and Keroes in the USA in 1951, and became the dominant topology during the post war recovery of consumer products
* Manufacturers bringing high-quality domestic hi-fi to a steadily widening audience, eventually leading to Dynaco selling over 300,000 ST-70's, making it the world's most popular hi-fi amplifier of any type to date.

===Tube hi-fi in the 1960s===
[[File:Tube push pull poweramplifier.PNG|thumb|400px|Conceptual diagram of a poweramplifier with a split-load phase inverter and push-pull EL34 pentodes endstage]]Valve amplification peaked as the mainstream technology during the 1960s and 70s, with device and circuits being highly developed. There have been only minor refinements since then.

The last generation of power tubes, typified by [[KT66]], [[EL34]] and [[KT88]], represent the pinnacle of the technology and of production quality.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}} Valve amplifiers produced since that time usually use one of these tubes, which have remained in continuous production (apart from KT66) ever since. Output power was typically 20 watts, exceptionally 35W.

Small signal valves overwhelmingly changed from octal base tubes, notably the audio tube of choice, the [[6SN7]] family, to the smaller and cheaper noval base [[ECC81]], [[ECC82]], [[ECC83]] (UK, in the US known as 12AX7,12AT7, etc.). The lower-power noval base [[EL84]] power pentode was widely used in less expensive 10-watt ultralinear power amplifiers, still of high fidelity.

Commercial tube manufacturers developed designs based on their own products, most notably the [[Mullard 5-10]] circuit. This design and the Williamson were widely implemented and imitated, with or without crediting the originator.

===Automobile amplifiers===
Valve radios and amplifiers were used in [[automobile]]s until they were displaced by [[transistor]]ized radios. Transistors had the major advantage of working off the voltage provided by a car battery. Early radios required a power unit to convert the battery voltage to a value high enough for the valves.  Later radios used special valves that were designed to operate directly from a 12 volt supply.&lt;ref&gt;Mullard ECH83, EBF83 are but two such examples.&lt;/ref&gt;  These later radios were hybrid designs which used transistors only for the audio output stages because a 12 volt power amplifier valve was not practical.  For this and other applications, transistors are smaller, cheaper, more durable, use less power, run cooler, and do not need to warm up.

Some enthusiasts prefer "tube amps", so a small number of valve car stereos are still made. Manufacturers include Milbert Amplifiers, Blade, Manley, and Sear Sound. Some are hybrid designs with transistors and valves.

===Valve preamplifiers===
Due to the very poor technical performance of early gramophones, the lack of standardised equalisations, poor components and accessories (including loudspeakers), preamplifiers historically contained extensive and very flexible [[Equalization (audio)|equalization]] and [[Tone control circuits|tone and filter]] circuits designed to adjust the [[frequency response]] of the amplifier and so the sound produced by the system.

Valve preamplifiers use triodes or low-noise pentodes ([[EF86]]). Mains hum from the heater filaments is a potential problem in low-level valve stages. Modern amplifiers invariably run from the mains; as there is little need to minimise costs in expensive valve amplifiers, the heater supply is often rectified and even regulated to reduce hum to an absolute minimum.

A representative valve preamp from the 1950s is the Leak 'varislope' series of preamps, which included a switchable rumble filter, a switchable scratch filter with selectable slopes and corner frequency, continuously variable treble and bass tone controls and a selection of 4 different gramophone equalisations (RIAA, ortho, RCA, 78).

===Valve sound===
{{main|Valve sound}}

Amplifiers from and prior to this period often have a distinctive sound that today is still widely referred to as "valve sound" and "warm". This tone is not strictly caused by the use of valves rather than transistors; it is merely a sound that was originally associated with amplifiers built using valves simply because that is what was available at the time. The origins of that particular sound are in part due to:
* the typical circuit designs of the time (class A or AB1), combined with
** simple circuits with relatively little feedback, producing mainly low-harmonic distortion (feedback that could be applied was limited by phase shift in the output transformer);
** low damping factor (High Z out) output stages;
** the use of very large amounts of feedback in signal transformerless semiconductor circuits, which leads to distortion that is small but has a much larger proportion of high harmonics than in valve circuits.

Factors relevant to valve equipment not designed to high-fidelity standards:
* dedicated guitar amplifiers had frequency response and distortion suited to their purpose,
* under-dimensioned and unregulated power supplies in amplifiers where power drawn varied significantly with instantaneous power output (class A not affected, classes AB1, AB2, B, increasingly so),
* poor quality output transformers in budget equipment.

==Notable historic designs==

The '''Yinberrie Hills Important Bird Area''' comprise some 1050&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; of rocky, [[tropical savanna]] covered, [[woodland|wooded]] hills in the lower [[Top End]] of the [[Northern Territory]] of [[Australia]].  They lie 45&amp;nbsp;km north  of the town of [[Katherine, Northern Territory|Katherine]], and about the same distance south of [[Pine Creek, Northern Territory|Pine Creek]].  The site is important for [[Gouldian finch]]es.

==Description==
The site is bounded by [[Nitmiluk National Park]] and the [[Arnhem Land|Arnhem Land Plateau]] in the east.  It consists of rolling hills with thin, sandy loam soils overlaid by angular [[Cobble (geology)|cobbles]].  The hills are covered by smooth-barked [[eucalypt]]s with an understorey of native [[grass]]es.  They are drained by a network of ephemeral streams which retain water through the [[dry season]] in small, scattered pools.  Mean annual rainfall in the area is about 1000&amp;nbsp;mm, falling mainly from December to March.  Key features of the habitat for the finches are that the lack of grazing, and few extensive [[wildfire|hot fires]], allow native grasses to seed; the persistent waterholes provide drinking water; the [[tree hollow|cavity]]-bearing trees provide nesting sites; and the perennial grasses on the adjacent lowlands provide seed during the [[wet season]].  Land tenure is primarily [[Aboriginal Australians|Aboriginal]] freehold land held by the Barnjarn Aboriginal Corporation and Wagiman Aboriginal Land Trust.&lt;ref name=bli&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.birdlife.org/datazone/sitefactsheet.php?id=24456|title=Yinberrie Hills |work= Sites – Important Bird Areas (IBAs) |publisher=Birdlife International |accessdate=2012-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Birds==
The site has been identified as an [[Important Bird Area]] (IBA) by [[BirdLife International]] principally because it is home to a population of [[endangered species|endangered]] [[Gouldian finch]]es.  It also supports [[chestnut-backed buttonquail]]s, [[bush stone-curlew]]s, [[varied lorikeet]]s, [[northern rosella]]s, [[hooded parrot]]s, [[white-gaped honeyeater|white-gaped]], [[yellow-tinted honeyeater|yellow-tinted]], [[bar-breasted honeyeater|bar-breasted]] and [[banded honeyeater]]s, [[masked finch|masked]] and [[long-tailed finch]]es, and [[silver-crowned friarbird]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.birdata.com.au/iba.vm |title=IBA: Yinberrie Hills |accessdate=2011-12-05 |work= Birdata |first= |last= |publisher=Birds Australia |date= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Other birds occasionally recorded from the IBA include the [[Australasian bittern]], [[partridge pigeon]], [[yellow-rumped munia]] and the northern subspecies of the [[crested shrike-tit]].&lt;ref name=bli/&gt;
