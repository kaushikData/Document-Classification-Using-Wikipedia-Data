Its current director is Laura Lindenfield.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.centerforcommunicatingscience.org/?cat=6 Staff and Leadership Archive], Center for Communicating Science&lt;/ref&gt;  Its goal is to help scientists learn to communicate more effectively with the public, including policymakers, students, funders and the media. It was inspired by [[Alan Alda]], the actor, writer and science advocate, in whose honor it was renamed in 2013, and is supported by [[Brookhaven National Laboratory]] and [[Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory]].&lt;ref name=sbpress&gt;{{cite web|title=It was a SM*A*S*H of Science|url=http://sbpress.com/2010/10/it-was-a-s-mash-of-science/|work=October 1, 2010|publisher=[[Stony Brook Press]]|accessdate=4 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Center offers courses in communication that have been taken by more than 200 graduate students in the sciences and health professions at Stony Brook. It also conducts workshops at universities, laboratories and science meetings around the country. Many of its workshops use improvisational theater exercises to help scientists connect more directly with listeners and respond more spontaneously to their needs.&lt;ref name="Actor Is Honored for Using Improv to Help Scientists Communicate"&gt;{{cite news |last=Basken |first=Paul |url=http://chronicle.com/article/Alan-Alda-the-Actor-Is/138673/ |title=Actor Is Honored for Using Improv to Help Scientists Communicate |work=[[The Chronicle of Higher Education]] |date=2013-04-30 |accessdate=2015-09-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Armenian birch mouse''' (''Sicista armenica'') is a [[species]] of [[rodent]] in the family [[Dipodidae]].

==Description==

It is a small rodent, like the mouse, the average weight of 10 g and up to 9&amp;nbsp;cm long, excluding the semi-prehensile tail, which slightly exceeds the length of the body. The body is brown, darker in the upper region.

==Biology==
 
The species shows nocturnal and feeds on seeds, berries and insects. Shifts in the ground with small jumps and can easily climb on the bushes and trees due to its semi-prehensile tail. The nest, oval shaped, is made of plant remains in a shallow hole dug by the animal itself.

==Distribution and habitat== 
 
The species is [[endemism|endemic]] to [[Armenia]], found in mixed forests of [[coniferous]] and broadleaf trees in the area upstream of the river Marmarik.

==Status and Conservation==

The Zoological Society of [[London]], on the basis of evolutionary uniqueness and smallness of the population, considers Armenian Birch Mouse one of the 100 species of [[mammal]]s at greatest risk of extinction.

The '''Association of Polar Early Career Scientists''' ('''APECS''') is a worldwide association of early career [[scientist]]s ([[undergraduate student|undergraduate]] and [[graduate student|graduate]] students, [[postdoc]]s, and early career [[Faculty (teaching staff)|faculty]]) interested in the [[polar regions]] and the [[cryosphere]] generally. Its mission is to raise the profile of polar scientists by providing a continuum of leadership that is both internationally and interdisciplinarily focused, and to stimulate collaborative projects. Several countries (Australia, Brazil, Bulgaria, Canada, Chile, Denmark, France, Germany, [[Association of Polar Early Career Scientists (APECS) - India Chapter|India]], Italy, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Russia, South Africa, Sweden, the United Kingdom and the United States) have their own APECS chapters that focus on the needs and ideas of scholars country-wise.

The APECS website serves as the main contact point for APECS members and provides forums sharing news, connecting with other polar researchers, finding jobs, and announcing events relevant to polar research.

APECS is an endorsed [[International Polar Year]] (IPY) project and is considered one of the major legacies of IPY.

==History and motivation==

A crucial event in the formation of APECS was a meeting in Sanga Saby, [[Sweden]], in September 2007. This meeting saw founders and members representatives of two key initiatives combine together under the name of APECS: the International Polar Year Youth Steering Committee (YSC) formed in 2005 and including several national YSC's, and a formative APECS, formed in 2006.

The International Polar Year (IPY) Youth Steering Committee (YSC), was founded in 2005 by Amber Church and Tyler Kuhn (co-chairs, Canada), Melianie Raymond (New Zealand), Jenny Baeseman (USA), Hugues Lantuit (Germany), Elie Verleyen (Belgium) and Stef Bokhorst (The Netherlands). Its aims were to ensure that IPY's goals to include the next generation of polar researchers and the world's youth were met. The YSC was designed as a decentralized institution relying on national committees, which rapidly came to life in several countries, including Canada, Germany, New Zealand, Portugal, Sweden, and the United Kingdom, among others. Those committees rapidly gained independence and developed their own networks as exemplified by the creation of the UK Polar Network in 2007.

A contributing factor to the success of the YSC's during the [[International Polar Year|IPY]] was strong support from the IPY International Program Office (IPO), based in Cambridge, UK, who ensured that the goals of the YSC would be heard in the community of senior researchers. The roles of [[Dave Carlson]] and Rhian Salmon, in particular, were crucial. The YSC focus was the creation, fostering and promotion of activities geared towards youth by young researchers. It largely focused on the involvement of school children and young adults in polar literacy projects and strengthening the communication between students and young researchers. Progressively, a need for a broader, more encompassing organization specifically geared towards young researchers and early career scientists arose.

Discussions on IPY education and outreach forums, similar initiatives in other scientific realms and the encounter of like-minded people created an awareness of the need for an organization driven by and serving early career researchers, focused on science and career development, unlike the YSC.

In the Autumn of 2006 to address these needs, [[Jenny Baeseman]] (USA), Hugues Lantuit (Germany) and Rhian Salmon (UK) laid the grounds for the rationale, structure, connections and future activities of APECS. The acronym was coined at the time and a nascent APECS was launched massively in early 2007, at the start of the IPY with Jenny Baseman and Hugues Lantuit as co-directors. In March 2007, discussions were initiated by the directors with the [[International Arctic Science Committee]] (IASC) and the [[Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research]] (SCAR) to offer APECS' services as representative of early career researchers in polar science. This early version of APECS then started evolving to serve better the needs of early career researchers interested in the polar regions and the wider cryosphere.

The YSC's activities developed concurrently with many (if not most) of the early career researchers involved in both organizations. Its scope, however, was limited in time, since it mainly focused on creating activities during the IPY. The need to ensure the continuation of successful initiatives and activities after the IPY led to brainstorming on post-IPY legacy. At the same time, the increase in young researcher initiatives in polar science started to create some confusion in the scientific community, questioning the structure, coordination and even the relevance of such organizations.

To address these issues, a meeting was organized at Sanga Saby outside [[Stockholm]], [[Sweden]] in September 2007 to bring together all these groups and prepare some long-term sustainable plans. The meeting was sponsored by the Swedish company Serla, the IPY IPO, and other international polar science entities The key outcomes of this meeting were the decisions to merge these groups, including the YSC, into one organization, retaining the name of APECS, and that APECS should adapt its structure to reflect better the multifaceted nature of its membership. This established APECS as a legacy of the YSC and other IPY projects. A new structure was launched at the end of the meeting including working groups, an advisory committee, an interim Council of the 24 attending participants (see below), an interim Executive Committee elected by the council Kriss Rokkan Iversen (Norway), Narelle Baker (UK), Hugues Lantuit (Germany), Dan Pringle (USA), and [[José Carlos Caetano Xavier|José Xavier]] (Portugal), and Jen Baeseman (USA) was appointed as an interim director. Kriss Rokkan Iversen received unanimous support of all voters and appointed by the Executive Committee as the interim President of APECS.

The Executive Committee and Director were charged with establishing APECS as an organization over the next 6–12 months. A report of activities in this period was made at the online APECS Council Meeting, 21 May 2008. Key progress included forming an international Advisory Committee of senior researchers and science administrators to provide guidance and support. A website was developed by in kind support from Iceland-based Arctic Portal through the generous support of director Halldór Jóhannsson. The website was established as a virtual home of APECS and amongst other features, includes study and job opportunities, meetings, news updates, and a discussion forum.

The executive committee met in March 2008 in Akureyri, Iceland to address strategic planning for APECS and draft the documents that will help sustain this organization for year to come; The Terms of Reference and the Rules of Procedure. This meeting was coordinated by Halldór Jóhannsson and supported by the University of Akureyri, Northern Research Forum and the Arctic Portal.

The ROP and TOR included a revision from the interim APECS structure to an open Council who elect an Executive Committee. The Council controls issues related to APECS governance and structure, and is expected to act on time scales of months – years. The Executive Committee is mandated by the Council with shorter time-scale decision making and running APECS on a day-to-day basis. (See the founding ROP and TOR for details.)

The organization now has an International Directorate Office hosted at the University of Tromsø, Norway.

==Membership==

The association represents people with a wide range of scientific expertise and interests including [[glaciology]], [[geology]], [[geodesy]], [[anthropology]], [[sociology]], [[political science]], [[atmospheric science]], [[oceanography]], polar [[biology]], culture and [[Natural heritage|heritage]] studies, [[linguistics]], [[space]] studies, [[biogeochemistry]], and [[paleontology]].

Membership in APECS is free and open to all early career scientists interested in [[natural science|natural]] and [[social science]]s of the polar regions, from undergraduates through assistant professors or equivalent for non-academic positions. Participation by engineers and those interested in the cryosphere in general is also being sought. APECS encourages senior researchers to register on the APECS website and serve as [[mentor]]s for the organization as well as post job openings and events at their institutions.

==Future plans==

APECS will be sponsoring several early career gatherings at IPY events and major research conferences around the world during the International Polar Year.

The '''Progressive Insurance Automotive X PRIZE''' ('''PIAXP''' or '''AXP''') was a set of competitions, programs and events, from the [[X Prize Foundation]], to "inspire a new generation of super-efficient vehicles that help break America's addiction to oil and stem the effects of climate change."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Competition Guidelines, Version 1.2, 13 January 2009|page=5|url=http://www.progressiveautoxprize.org/files/downloads/auto/PIAXP_Guidelines_V_1.0_20090110.pdf|publisher=[[X Prize Foundation]]|accessdate=2009-06-21|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090801164332/http://www.progressiveautoxprize.org/files/downloads/auto/PIAXP_Guidelines_V_1.0_20090110.pdf|archivedate=1 August 2009|deadurl=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Progressive Corporation|Progressive Insurance]] was the title sponsor of the prize, the centerpiece of which is the Competition Division, within which a 10-million-dollar purse was divided between the winners of three competitions.

The essence of each competition was to design, build and race super-efficient vehicles that achieved 100 [[Miles per gallon of gasoline equivalent|MPGe]] (2.35&amp;nbsp;liter/100&amp;nbsp;kilometer) efficiency, produced less than 200&amp;nbsp;grams/mile well-to-wheel CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; equivalent [[Exhaust gas|emissions]], and could be manufactured for the mass market.&lt;ref name='msnbc'/&gt;  Within the Competition Division, there are two vehicle classes: Mainstream and Alternative. The mainstream class had a prize of $5 million. The alternate class had two separate prizes of $2.5 million, one for side-by-side seating and one for tandem seating.&lt;ref name="guidelines"&gt;{{cite web|title=Competition Guidelines|url=http://www.progressiveautoxprize.org/files/downloads/auto/PIAXP_Guidelines_V_1.0_20090110.pdf|format=PDF|publisher=progressiveautoxprize.org|accessdate=2009-05-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The PIAXP has an Educational Program, funded by a $3.5 million grant from the [[United States Department of Energy]], to engage students and the public in learning about advanced vehicle technologies, energy efficiency, climate change, alternative fuels, and the science, technology, engineering, and math behind efficient vehicle development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Education Program  Overview |url=http://www.progressiveautoxprize.org/education|publisher=[[X Prize Foundation]]|accessdate=2009-06-30| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090614171836/http://www.progressiveautoxprize.org/education| archivedate= 14 June 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The X Prize Foundation began work on the development of a competition to spur innovation in the automotive industry in 2005 and on 6 March 2006 announced that Mark Goodstein would join the Foundation as an Executive Director of the new prize.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Press Release: X Prize Foundation Hires Mark Goodstein as Executive Director|url= http://www.progressiveautoxprize.org/press-release/x-prize-foundation-hires-mark-goodstein-as-executive-director |publisher=[[X Prize Foundation]]|accessdate=2009-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A little more than year later, on 12 April 2007, the Foundation formally announced the creation of the prize at the 2007 New York Auto Show and set the purse at $10 million for a car that could get {{convert|100|mpgus|L/100&amp;nbsp;km mpgimp|abbr=on}} and be sold for a reasonable price.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Auto X Prize to reward 100-mpg car|url=http://blogs.consumerreports.org/cars/2007/04/auto_x_prize_to.html|author=Eric Evarts|publisher=[[Consumer Reports]]|accessdate=2009-06-30|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090305093834/http://blogs.consumerreports.org/cars/2007/04/auto_x_prize_to.html|archivedate=5 March 2009|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the subsequent year, the X Prize Foundation solidified sponsorship for the prize and on 20 March 2008 announced that Progressive Insurance would be the Title Sponsor of the Prize and fund the $10 million purse.  From that point onward, it was known as the Progressive Insurance Automotive X Prize (PIAXP).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Press Release: X Prize Foundation Progressive Insurance Join Forces to Officially Announce the $10 Million Automotive X Prize|url= http://www.progressiveautoxprize.org/press-release/x-prize-foundation-hires-mark-goodstein-as-executive-director |publisher=[[X Prize Foundation]]|accessdate=2009-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the 12 April 2007 announcement of the creation of the X Prize, the Foundation released draft Competition Guidelines, which were open for public comment from 2 April to 31 May 2007.  The latest guidelines were published on 10 January 2009. The competition guidelines are the product of hundreds of volunteers of the AXP and world-class advisors.&lt;ref name="guidelines"/&gt;

On 7 April 2009, the [[X Prize Foundation]] announced that 111 teams had registered by the February 2009 deadline.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.progressiveautoxprize.org/news-events/press-release/111-teams-get-green-light-to-advance-in-multimillion-dollar-competition|title=111 Teams Get Green Light to Advance in Multimillion Dollar Competition|publisher=[[X Prize Foundation]]|accessdate=2010-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 20 October 2009, the design judging had winnowed the number of teams down to 43, with some publicly, and others quietly, withdrawing.&lt;ref name="progressiveautoxprize.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.progressiveautoxprize.org/teams |title=Teams &amp;#124; Progressive Automotive XPRIZE |publisher=Progressiveautoxprize.org |accessdate=2011-01-10| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20101228170845/http://www.progressiveautoxprize.org/teams| archivedate= 28 December 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The formal vehicle competition events began on 26 April 2010, and consisted of the remaining four stages: Shakedown (26 April – 7 May 2010), Knockout ( 16–30 June 2010), Finals ( 19–30 July 2010) and Validation (August 2010).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=COMPETITION TIMELINE|url= http://www.progressiveautoxprize.org/prize-details/competition-timeline |publisher=[[X Prize Foundation]]|accessdate=2011-01-10| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20101228192728/http://www.progressiveautoxprize.org/prize-details/competition-timeline| archivedate= 28 December 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Winners===
The winners of the competition were announced on 16 September 2010.&lt;ref name="XPrizeAwards"&gt;{{cite web|title=Three Teams Awarded Share of $10 Million Purse in Progressive Insurance Automotive X PRIZE for Super Fuel-Efficient Vehicles|url=http://www.progressiveautoxprize.org/news-events/press-releases/three-teams-awarded-share-10-million-purse-progressive-insurance-automotive-x-prize-super-fu|publisher=[[X Prize Foundation]]|accessdate=17 September 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100919163613/http://www.progressiveautoxprize.org/news-events/press-releases/three-teams-awarded-share-10-million-purse-progressive-insurance-automotive-x-prize-super-fu| archivedate= 19 September 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Team Edison2 won the $5 million Mainstream competition with its four-passenger [[Very Light Car]], obtaining 102.5&amp;nbsp;MPGe or just below 69&amp;nbsp;MPG running on [[E85]] fuel.
* Team [[Li-Ion Motors]] won the $2.5 million Alternative Side-by-Side competition with their aerodynamic Wave-II electric vehicle achieving 187&amp;nbsp;MPGe.
* Team [[X-Tracer Switzerland]] won the $2.5 million Alternative Tandem competition with their 205.3&amp;nbsp;MPGe faired electric motorcycle.

==Vehicle requirements==
Within the Competition Division, there are two vehicle classes—Mainstream and Alternative—both of which have the same requirements for [[Fuel economy in automobiles|fuel economy]] and [[Exhaust gas|emissions]], but differing design constraints. The Alternative class is further divided into tandem and side-by-side classes.  Vehicles in the Mainstream Class must meet specifications that are derived from typical small, five-passenger, economy mixed-use vehicles.  The Alternative Class has fewer performance and design restrictions and provides an outlet for innovation.  Both classes allow entries that are modifications of an existing popular vehicle, provided that all PIAXP requirements are met.

Vehicles in both classes must have a fuel economy of 100 [[Miles per gallon of gasoline equivalent|MPGe]] (21&amp;nbsp;kWh or 2.35&amp;nbsp;liters of petrol/100&amp;nbsp;kilometer) and produce less than 200&amp;nbsp;grams/mile CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions (measured well-to-wheel).  For electric vehicles, the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions requirement is a more binding constraint.  Because CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions will be calculated assuming a national average of electricity sources projected to 2014, an all-electric car will have to achieve 114 MPGe in order to produce less than 200&amp;nbsp;grams/mile CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions.  Further, electricity consumption is measured at the "plug" side of the battery charging device, so it would have to achieve 114 MPGe, assuming 100% efficient battery charging.  If the charger were 85% efficient, this requirement would grow to 134 MPGe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Competition Guidelines, Version 1.2, 13 January 2009|pages=27, 29|url=http://www.progressiveautoxprize.org/files/downloads/auto/PIAXP_Guidelines_V_1.0_20090110.pdf|publisher=[[X Prize Foundation]]|accessdate=2009-06-21| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090801164332/http://www.progressiveautoxprize.org/files/downloads/auto/PIAXP_Guidelines_V_1.0_20090110.pdf| archivedate= 1 August 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Energy and Emissions Spreadsheet 12.1.08| url=http://www.progressiveautoxprize.org/files/downloads/auto/Energy_and_Emissions_spreadsheet_12.1.08.xls|publisher=[[X Prize Foundation]]|accessdate=2009-07-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the other words, efficiency of electric cars should be not 21 but 16 kWh/100&amp;nbsp;km.

Vehicles in both classes also must have features expected of a modern automobile including an enclosed cabin with windshield and windows, operating windshield wipers, washers, headlights, horn, indicators, brake lights, reflective devices, rear and side-view mirrors, and seat belts.  They must have the usual automotive controls, including accelerator pedal, brake pedal, steering mechanism (not necessarily a wheel) and indicators.  They must be "highway capable", which is defined as the ability to maintain {{convert|65|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}} on a four percent uphill grade and to accelerate from {{convert|40|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}} to {{convert|60|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}} in less than 9&amp;nbsp;seconds.  They must be able to brake from 60 to 0&amp;nbsp;mph in less than {{convert|170|ft|m}}, meet existing noise standards and use tires that meet automotive or motorcycle (alternative class only and only if the vehicle is otherwise eligible to be classified as a motorcycle) standards.  Both must meet the same set of static and dynamic stability requirements.

The mainstream vehicle must seat at least four adults with at least two side-by-side front seats, have at least {{convert|10|cuft|m3}} of useful cargo space in one contiguous location not counting the passenger seats, accelerate from 0 to {{convert|60|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}} in 15&amp;nbsp;seconds or less, and be able to drive {{convert|200|mi|km}} without refueling or recharging.  The mainstream vehicle must have four or more wheels.

The alternate class vehicle must seat at least two people, accelerate from 0 to {{convert|60|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}} in 18&amp;nbsp;seconds or less, and be able to drive {{convert|100|mi|km}} without refueling or recharging.  The alternative vehicle has no minimum number of wheels, but it must remain upright when stopped with no driver inputs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Competition Guidelines, Version 1.2, 13 January 2009|pages=16, 20|url=http://www.progressiveautoxprize.org/files/downloads/auto/PIAXP_Guidelines_V_1.0_20090110.pdf|publisher=[[X Prize Foundation]]|accessdate=2009-06-21| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090801164332/http://www.progressiveautoxprize.org/files/downloads/auto/PIAXP_Guidelines_V_1.0_20090110.pdf| archivedate= 1 August 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the main focus of PIAXP is fuel economy and carbon emissions, not safety, the vehicles must be "production capable".  Therefore, the entries must either be fully compliant with the [[Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard 108|Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards]] (FMVSS) and other applicable [[National Highway Traffic Safety Administration]] (NHTSA) requirements or compliance has to be "designed in".  For example, allowance for airbags in the designs is considered acceptable without actually installing the airbags.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Competition Guidelines, Version 1.2, 13 January 2009|pages=20, 21|url=http://www.progressiveautoxprize.org/files/downloads/auto/PIAXP_Guidelines_V_1.0_20090110.pdf|publisher=[[X Prize Foundation]]|accessdate=2009-06-21| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090801164332/http://www.progressiveautoxprize.org/files/downloads/auto/PIAXP_Guidelines_V_1.0_20090110.pdf| archivedate= 1 August 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Teams are also required to submit a [[business plan]] which clearly demonstrates an ability to produce 10,000 vehicles per year.  Note that teams are not required to be under-taking this plan, but the plan has to exist and the car has to be designed such that this plan is feasible.

With the lack of mainstream entrants from established automobile companies, a Demonstration Division was created so that automakers could at least display and promote their highest efficiency vehicles alongside the main competition.  However, there were too few entrants by 1 March registration deadline, and this division was canceled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.progressiveautoxprize.org/prize-details/registration|title=X Prize Team Registration page|date=1 March 2010|publisher=[[X Prize Foundation]]|accessdate=6 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The only confirmed entrant was the [[Tesla Roadster (2008)|Tesla Roadster]], which had dropped out of the main competition.

Vehicles in the Demonstration Division would have met the same requirements as Mainstream Class vehicles in the Competition Division, except for MPGe and CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions.  There was no Alternative Class equivalent in the Demonstration Division.  These vehicles would have been stock vehicles, i.e., vehicles identical to those for sale or pre-production prototypes of vehicles intended for sales.

Vehicles in the Demonstration Division would have been tested in the same way as Competition Division vehicles and would have participated in the PIAXP competition events under the same rules in order to demonstrate and showcase their capabilities and performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Competition Guidelines, Version 1.2, 13 January 2009|pages=39, 40|url=http://www.progressiveautoxprize.org/files/downloads/auto/PIAXP_Guidelines_V_1.0_20090110.pdf|publisher=[[X Prize Foundation]]|accessdate=2009-06-21| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090801164332/http://www.progressiveautoxprize.org/files/downloads/auto/PIAXP_Guidelines_V_1.0_20090110.pdf| archivedate= 1 August 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Competition events==
The competition timeline was finalized as follows:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.progressiveautoxprize.org/prize-details/competition-timeline|title=Competition Timeline|publisher=[[X Prize Foundation]]|accessdate=6 May 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100504221127/http://www.progressiveautoxprize.org/prize-details/competition-timeline| archivedate= 4 May 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Design judging===
Accepted teams must provide evidence that their vehicles are production capable, by providing a detailed Data Submissions covering four areas:

* Safety and Emissions:  Vehicles must be designed so that, in production, they meet U.S. safety standards (FMVSS) and U.S. emission standards.
* Manufacturability and Cost:  Vehicles must be capable of being manufactured in quantities of 10,000 per year with production costs within levels consistent with that production volume.
* Features:  Vehicles must have the features expected by consumers for vehicles within the projected prices range.
* Business Plan:  There must be a credible plan to manufacture, sell and support 10,000 vehicles (or conversions) per year by 2014.  The plan must address required fuel infrastructure if it does not already exist.

Those that pass this hurdle will be invited to bring their vehicles to the competition events.  The design judging was closed in October 2009, with 43 teams remaining.

===Shakedown stages===
The first three stages will be a “shake-down” period and performance in these stages will not count to final scores.  The first step of the competition will be the review of technical reports, technical inspection of the vehicles and performance testing of safety elements to eliminate unsafe vehicles.  The two-week shakedown took place at the [[Michigan International Speedway]], from 26 April to 7 May 2010.

Those that pass the initial technical and safety inspections and tests will participate in the remaining competition events. These include stage races, additional active safety performance tests and a dynamometer test.

===Knockout stage===
The next stage will be a “knockout” qualifying event.  To advance, vehicles must pass active safety performance tests, meet acceptable emission levels and demonstrate at least 67 MPGe on a test track.  These were held at the [[Michigan International Speedway]] from  20–29 June 2010.  After this stage, only 15 vehicles from 12 teams remained in the competition.

===Finals stage===
The final stages will determine the winning teams.  To complete the race successfully, vehicles must maintain a minimum average speed (maximum allowable time) while meeting PIAXP requirements for fuel economy (90 MPGe) and emissions.  The finals also include a tie breaking race; the vehicle with the best overall time while still meeting requirements will take the purse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Competition Guidelines, Version 1.2, 13 January 2009|pages=10–12|url=http://www.progressiveautoxprize.org/files/downloads/auto/PIAXP_Guidelines_V_1.0_20090110.pdf|publisher=[[X Prize Foundation]]|accessdate=2009-06-21| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090801164332/http://www.progressiveautoxprize.org/files/downloads/auto/PIAXP_Guidelines_V_1.0_20090110.pdf| archivedate= 1 August 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The final stages are scheduled for  19–30 July 2010 at the [[Michigan International Speedway]].

===Validation stage===
The few remaining teams were validated on [[dynamometer]]s under laboratory conditions at the EPA Labs in [[Ann Arbor, Michigan]] and [[Argonne National Laboratory]] in [[Chicago, Illinois]]. This stage is scheduled for August 2010. The validation results count toward 50% of the final efficiency figures, which together must exceed 100 MPGe.

Edison2 was an exception. The engines in both Very Light Cars failed before validation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://autoblog.xprize.org/axp/2010/08/the-competition-isnt-over-yet-why-validation-matters.html#comments| title = The Competition Isn’t Over Yet: Why Validation Matters| accessdate = 2011-03-31| author = Eric Cahill| publisher = Progressive Automotive XPrize Blog}}&lt;/ref&gt; Edison2 was allowed to circumvent the rules governing procedures and provided independent third-party validation reports instead of undergoing the same validation testing as other finalist teams.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.edmunds.com/greencaradvisor/2010/08/auto-x-prizes-mainstream-finalist-gets-ok-to-provide-own-validation-results.html |title=Auto X-Prize's 'Mainstream' Finalist Gets OK to Provide Own Validation Results |accessdate=2011-03-31 |author=John O'Dell |publisher=Edmunds.com Green Car Advisor |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100820062230/http://blogs.edmunds.com/greencaradvisor/2010/08/auto-x-prizes-mainstream-finalist-gets-ok-to-provide-own-validation-results.html |archivedate=20 August 2010 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Educational program==
The [[United States Department of Energy]] joined the PIAXP as a sponsor, funding an educational program targeted to young people.  The first component of the Education Program is a web site created in partnership with Discovery Education, www.FuelOurFutureNow.com, featuring activities for K-12 students, as well as videos, virtual labs, and interactive resources intended for use in school and in the home.

==Competing teams==
Although 111 teams registered for the PAIXP and paid the registration fee,
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.progressiveautoxprize.org/files/downloads/auto/Complete_List_of_Registered_PIAXP_Teams.pdf| title= Registered Teams Overview| publisher=''[[X Prize Foundation]]| accessdate=10 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  by 20 October 2009, the number of teams had decreased to 43, sponsoring 53 vehicles between them.&lt;ref name="progressiveautoxprize.org"/&gt;  These remaining teams represented 10 countries (some entries listed two countries of origin) with 28 coming from the United States and 7 from the state of California.  Of the 53 vehicles, 28 were in the Alternative Classes and 25 in the Mainstream Class.  By 15 April, only 30 teams remained. After the shakedown completed in May, 22 teams remained.&lt;ref name="shakedown"&gt;{{cite web|last=Evarts |first=Eric |title=Automotive X Prize: Final Shakedown results |url=http://blogs.consumerreports.org/cars/2010/05/automotive-x-prize-final-shakedown-results.html |publisher=[[Consumer Reports]] Cars Blog |accessdate=2010-05-17 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100517063031/http://blogs.consumerreports.org/cars/2010/05/automotive-x-prize-final-shakedown-results.html |archivedate=17 May 2010 |deadurl=no }}&lt;/ref&gt;  A sample of the teams is shown below.

'''Barton''' [[Impact crater|crater]] is a 54-km (32-mi) diameter crater on [[Venus]]. It is the size at which craters on Venus begin to possess [[Peak ring (crater)|peak-rings]] instead of a single central peak. The floor of Barton crater is flat and radar-dark, indicating possible infilling by lava flows sometime following the impact. Barton's central peak-ring is discontinuous and appears to have been disrupted or separated during or following the cratering process. The crater is named after [[Clara Barton]], the founder of the [[American Red Cross]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2922">A '''brassboard''' or '''brass board''' is an experimental or demonstration test model, intended for field testing outside the [[laboratory]] environment. A brassboard follows an earlier prototyping stage called a [[breadboard]]. A brassboard contains both the functionality and approximate physical configuration of the final operational product. Unlike breadboards, brassboards typically recreate geometric and dimensional constraints of the final system which are critical to its performance, as is the case in [[radio frequency]] systems.&lt;ref&gt;[[Harold Mooz|Mooz]] et al., p. 205.&lt;/ref&gt; While representative of the physical layout of the production-grade product, a brassboard will not necessarily incorporate all final details, nor represent the physical size and quality level of the final deliverable product.

Exact definition of a brassboard depends on the industry and has changed with time. A 1992 guide book on [[Request for proposal|proposal preparation]] defined a brassboard ''or'' a breadboard as "a laboratory or shop working model that may or may not look like the final product or system, but that will operate in the same way as the final system". The definition of a
breadboard was further narrowed to purely electronic systems, while a brassboard was treated as "a similar arrangement for hydraulic, pneumatic or mechanically interconnected components".&lt;ref&gt;Stewart and Stewart, p. 46.&lt;/ref&gt;

In modern [[system-on-a-chip]] prototyping, brassboard is defined as a second prototyping stage that follows [[engineering validation board]]s (EVB) and precedes [[wingboard]]s and final pre-production samples. Typically, the board area decreases four times with each of these steps, so a brassboard is one fourth as large as an EVB, four times larger than a wingboard and around sixteen times larger than a production device. A modern brassboard [[printed circuit board]] typically contains ten conductive layers while a considerably larger EVB typically has eighteen (it needs larger and more sophisticated [[ground plane]]s to overcome the effects of larger area and longer connecting tracks).&lt;ref&gt;Waldo, p. 170.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''CNN Business''' (formerly '''CNN Money''') is a financial news and information website, operated by [[CNN]]. The website was originally formed as a joint venture between CNN and [[Time Warner]]'s ''[[Fortune (magazine)|Fortune]]'' and ''[[Money (magazine)|Money]]'' magazines. Since the spin-off of Time Warner's publishing assets as [[Time Inc.]], the site has since operated as part of [[CNN.com]] and is no longer tied to these magazines.

==History==
CNN Money launched in 2001, replacing [[CNNfn]]'s website. Time Warner had also announced an intention to relaunch the CNNfn television network under the CNN Money moniker, but those plans were apparently scrapped.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|url=http://www.timewarner.com/newsroom/press-releases/2001/01/31/cnnfn-to-become-cnn-money|title=CNNfn To Become CNN MONEY|publisher=Time Warner|date=January 31, 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to June 2014, the website was operated as a joint venture between [[CNN]] and two Time Warner-published business magazines; ''[[Fortune (magazine)|Fortune]]'' and ''[[Money (magazine)|Money]]''. In June 2014, Time Warner's publishing assets were spun-out as [[Time Inc.]]; as a result, all three properties launched separate web presences, with CNN's site renamed '''CNNMoney'''. With the re-launch, CNN head [[Jeff Zucker]] also promised increased synergies between the website and the CNN channel, such as branded segments and the re-branding of CNN's weekly financial show ''Your Money'' as ''CNNMoney''.&lt;ref name=tvn-newcnnmoney&gt;{{cite web|author=Merrill Knox |title=New CNNMoney 'Will Be More Connected to CNN Television Than Ever'|url=http://www.mediabistro.com/tvnewser/new-cnnmoney-will-be-more-connected-to-cnn-television-than-ever_b227101|website=TVNewser|accessdate=July 22, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Emma Bazilian|title=Fortune, Money Spinoff From CNNMoney.com - Both titles finally have stand-alone sites|url=http://www.adweek.com/news/press/fortune-money-spin-cnnmoneycom-158054|accessdate=July 22, 2014|work=Adweek|date=June 1, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2018, CNN re-launched the vertical as '''CNN Business'''; the new brand is focused on "digital transformation of business, and how it is disrupting every corner of the global economy". The relaunch came alongside the opening of a new San Francisco bureau. As with CNNMoney, it will be supported by branded segments on CNN television, as well as streaming content.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.adweek.com/tvnewser/cnn-business-launches-today-with-a-new-san-francisco-bureau/379820|title=CNN Business Launches Today With a New San Francisco Bureau|website=TVNewser|language=en-US|access-date=2018-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2018 came the launch of the first country-specific version, [[CNNMoney Switzerland]], with a main newsroom in [[Zurich]] broadcasting three hours of live English-language business and financial news programming every weekday. The channel is privately-owned, and the first implementation of CNN Worldwide's plan to roll out the CNNMoney brand internationally.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.broadbandtvnews.com/2018/01/23/cnn-money-switzerland-to-launch-on-january-24/ "CNN Money Switzerland to launch on January 24"]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The C.A.N''' (Convenient, Attractive, Normal) '''approach''' to eating behavior reveals three different ways or strategies that [[consumer psychology]] can be used to provide an organized framework to help people make healthier food choices.  The C is for convenient, the A is for attractive, and the N is for normal.  The idea was researched and created by Brian Wansink, Director of the Cornell Food and Brand Lab and others at Cornell University.   The researchers reviewed over 100 studies and found three things help people choose healthier foods.  The food must be convenient (C), attractive (A) and normal (N), or CAN.  The idea behind the CAN approach is to make foods like fruits and vegetables visible and easy to reach (convenient), nicely displayed (attractive), and look like a good choice (normal).
In a study, published in Psychology and Marketing, showed that when fruit is put in a nice bowl in your home on the counter—it becomes more convenient, attractive, and normal to grab a banana or orange, rather than the chocolate ice cream in the hidden back of the freezer.  Therefore, the CAN idea helps make healthier eating choices easier.
The results of this study are intended to help consumers make healthier decisions by adjusting the way they select and serve their food. The authors suggest these organizational frameworks can be used to show how research can help transform consumer eating environments.

== C.A.N. Method in the media ==

An article on cbsnews.com describes the research as more helpful then willpower alone to help lose weight and eat healthier.&lt;ref&gt;Myers, C. (2015, May 6). "[http://www.cbsnews.com/news/3-steps-to-healthier-eating-when-willpower-isnt-enough/ 3 steps to healthier eating (when willpower isn't enough)]". Retrieved July 15, 2015, from&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Comas Sola''' (sometimes as '''Comas Solá''') is an [[impact crater]] on [[Mars]], located in the [[Memnonia quadrangle]] at 19.59°S latitude and 168.51°W longitude, and is inside [[Terra Sirenum]]. It measures {{cvt|120.24|km}} in diameter and was named after the Spanish [[Catalans|Catalan]] astronomer [[Josep Comas Solá]]. The name was approved by [[International Astronomical Union|IAU's]] [[Working Group for Planetary System Nomenclature]] in 1973.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Gazetteer of Planetary Nomenclature: Comas Sola |url=http://planetarynames.wr.usgs.gov/Feature/1276|website=usgs.gov |publisher=[[International Astronomical Union]] |accessdate=October 22, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Surrounding the southerm rim are two smaller unnamed craters, each with a central peak or mount, with the southwest touching the southwest rim, in the north rim, three tiny craters which also has a central mound. Almost touching the crater are a series of rilles and rifts known as [[Memnonia Fossae]] that were once fault lines

The '''counterion condensation''' phenomenon is commonly described by Manning’s
theory (Manning 1969), which assumes that [[counterion]]s can condense 
onto polyions until the charged density between neighboring monomer charges 
along the polyion chain is reduced below a certain critical value. In the model the 
real polyion chain is replaced by an idealized line charge, where the polyion 
is represented by a uniformly charged thread of zero radius, infinite
length and finite charge density, and the condensed counterion layer is 
assumed to be in physical equilibrium with the ionic atmosphere surrounding 
the polyion. The uncondensed mobile ions in the ionic atmosphere are treated 
within the [[Debye–Hückel equation|Debye–Hückel]] (DH) approximation. The 
phenomenon of counterion condensation now takes place when the dimensionless 
Coulomb coupling strength 
:&lt;math&gt;\Gamma = \lambda_B/l_{charge} &gt; 1&lt;/math&gt;, 
where &lt;math&gt;\lambda_B&lt;/math&gt; represents the [[Bjerrum length]] and 
&lt;math&gt;l_{charge}&lt;/math&gt; the distance between neighboring charged [[monomer]]s. 
In this case the [[The Coulomb potential|Coulomb interactions]] dominate over 
the thermal interactions and counterion condensation is favored. For many standard 
[[polyelelctrolyte|polyelectrolytes]], this phenomenon is relevant, since the 
distance between neighboring monomer charges typically ranges between 2 and 3 Å and 
&lt;math&gt;\lambda_B \approx&lt;/math&gt; 7 Å in water.

In the case of the [[chondroitin sulfate]] (CS) systems, which is a major 
biopolyelectrolyte controlling the frictional-compressive properties 
of articular cartilage, the Coulomb coupling strength is &lt;math&gt;\Gamma \approx&lt;/math&gt; 
1.4, which implies that according to Manning's theory counterion condensation 
should take place. However, since Manning’s theory does not take into account 
the molecular details of real polyion chains, like e.g. local solvation 
effects or atomic partial charge distributions, CS systems are a borderline 
case and should be considered more carefully (Bathe 2005). Field-theoretic
investigations (Baeurle 2009) have recently demonstrated that the phenomenon of 
counterion condensation disappears in the limit of infinite dilution in solutions 
of low concentration of added salt, which is in opposition with the predictions 
of Manning’s theory but in conformity with Ostwald’s principle. By contrast at 
physiological salt concentration, the phenomenon has been found to play a predominant 
role in determining the frictional-compressive properties of articular cartilage
(Baeurle 2009).

== Critisism ==
The counterion condensation originally only describes the behaviour of a charged rod. It competes here with [[Poisson-Boltzmann|Poisson-Boltzmann theory]], which was shown to give less artificial results than the counterion condensation theories.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Stigter|first=D|date=August 1995|title=Evaluation of the counterion condensation theory of polyelectrolytes.|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1236262/|journal=Biophysical Journal|volume=69|issue=2|pages=380–388|doi=10.1016/S0006-3495(95)79910-6|issn=0006-3495|pmc=1236262|pmid=8527651}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1485">The  '''definition of the situation''' is a  fundamental concept in [[symbolic interactionism]] advanced by the American sociologist [[W. I. Thomas]].  It involves a proposal upon the characteristics of a social situation (e.g. norms, values, authority, participants' roles), and seeks agreement from others in a way that can facilitate social cohesion and social action.  Conflicts often involve disagreements over definitions of the situation in question.  This definition may thus become an area contested between different stakeholders (or by an ego's sense of self-identity).

A definition of the situation is related to the idea of "[[Framing (social sciences)|framing]]" a situation.  The construction, presentation, and maintenance of frames of interaction (i.e., social context and expectations), and identities ([[self-concept|self-identities]] or group identities), are fundamental aspects of micro-level social interaction.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6660">'''Dispositif''' is a term used by the French intellectual [[Michel Foucault]], generally to refer to the various institutional, physical, and administrative mechanisms and knowledge structures which enhance and maintain the exercise of [[Power (philosophy)|power]] within the social body.

==Translation==
Dispositif is translated variously, even in the same book, as 'device', 'machinery', 'apparatus', 'construction', and 'deployment'.

== Definition ==

Foucault uses the term in his 1977 "The Confession of the Flesh" interview, where he answers the question, "What is the meaning or methodological function for you of this term, [[Apparatus theory|apparatus]] (dispositif)?" as follows:

:''"What I'm trying to pick out with this term is, firstly, a thoroughly heterogeneous ensemble consisting of discourses, institutions, architectural forms, regulatory decisions, laws, administrative measures, scientific statements, philosophical, moral and philanthropic propositions–in short, the said as much as the unsaid. Such are the elements of the apparatus. The apparatus itself is the system of relations that can be established between these elements."''&lt;ref&gt;"The Confession of the Flesh" (1977) interview. In Power/Knowledge Selected Interviews and Other Writings (ed Colin Gordon), 1980: pp. 194–228.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://foucaultblog.wordpress.com/2007/04/01/what-is-the-dispositif "What is the ''dispositive''?"] Foucault Blog, April 1, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

The German linguist [[Siegfried Jäger]] defines Foucault's ''dispositif'' as

:''"the interaction of discursive behavior (i. e. speech and thoughts based upon a shared knowledge pool), non-discursive behavior (i. e. acts based upon knowledge), and manifestations of knowledge by means of acts or behaviors ''...''. ''Dispositifs'' can thus be imagined as a kind of ''[[Gesamtkunstwerk]]'', the complexly interwoven and integrated ''dispositifs'' add up in their entirety to a ''dispositif'' of all society."''&lt;ref&gt;''"das Zusammenspiel diskursiver Praxen (= Sprechen und Denken auf der Grundlage von Wissen), nichtdiskursiver Praxen (= Handeln auf der Grundlage von Wissen) und „Sichtbarkeiten“ bzw. „Vergegenständlichungen“ (von Wissen durch Handeln/Tätigkeit) ''...''. Dispositive kann man sich insofern auch als eine Art „Gesamtkunstwerke“ vorstellen, die – vielfältig  miteinander verzahnt und verwoben – ein gesamtgesellschaftliches Dispositiv ausmachen."'', [http://www.diss-duisburg.de/Internetbibliothek/Artikel/Aspekte_einer_Kritischen_Diskursanalyse.htm Siegfried Jäger: Theoretische und methodische Aspekte einer Kritischen Diskurs- und Dispositivanalyse]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Danish philosopher Raffnsøe "advances the 'dispositive' (le dispositif) as a key conception in Foucault's work" and "a resourceful approach to the study of contemporary societal problems."&lt;ref&gt;What is a dispositive? Foucault's historical mappings of the networks of social reality" https://www.academia.edu/9838825/What_is_a_dispositive_Foucault_s_historical_mappings_of_the_networks_of_social_reality&lt;/ref&gt; According to Raffnsøe, "the dispositionally prescriptive level is a crucial aspect of social reality in organizational life, since it has a determining effect on what is taken for granted and considered real. Furthermore, it determines not only what is and can be considered possible but also what can even be imagined and anticipated as potentially realizable, as something one can hope for, or act to bring about".&lt;ref&gt;Foucault's dispositive: The perspicacity of dispositive analytics in organizational Research": 21

The Italian political philosopher [[Giorgio Agamben]] traces the trajectory of the term to [[Aristotle]]'s ''oikonomia—the effective management of the household''  and the early Church Fathers' attempt to save the concept of the Trinity from the allegation of polytheism, as the triplicity of the God is his oikonomia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=jDGrBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA59&amp;lpg=PA59&amp;dq=dispositif+agamben+dictionary&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=98j4y5vhL5&amp;sig=QBqpf3kZtb92q246YMByRdoidmE&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwieqfWgz_7PAhUIL48KHYe9DoIQ6AEIHTAB#v=onepage&amp;q=dispositif%20agamben%20dictionary&amp;f=false|title=Agamben Dictionary|last=Murray|first=Alex|date=2011-06-06|publisher=Edinburgh University Press|isbn=9780748646982|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Agamben defines the ''apparatus''/''dispositif'' as

:''"Further expanding the already large class of Foucauldian apparatuses, I shall call an apparatus literally anything that has in some way the capacity to capture, orient, determine, intercept, model, control, or secure the gestures, behaviors, opinions, or discourses of living beings. Not only, therefore, prisons, madhouses, the panopticon, schools, confession, factories, disciplines, judicial measures, and so forth (whose connection with power is in a certain sense evident), but also the pen, writing, literature, philosophy, agriculture, cigarettes, navigation, computers, cellular telephones and—why not—language itself, which is perhaps the most ancient of apparatuses—one in which thousands and thousands of years ago a primate inadvertently let himself be captured, probably without realizing the consequences that he was about to face."''&lt;ref&gt;Giorgio Agamben, "What is an Apparatus?" in ''What is an Apparatus? And Other Essays''. Stanford: Stanford University Press, 2009: p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Italian scholar Matteo Pasquinelli criticises Agamben's genealogy with these words

:''"The dispositif is traced back, theoretically and philologically, to the definition of social normativity that Foucault takes from Canguilhem's The Normal and the Pathological (1966) and to the use of the term dispositif by Canguilhem himself in the essay "Machine and Organism" (1952). Both these lineages proceed from the notion of organic normativity that Canguilhem adopts from the German-Jewish neurologist Kurt Goldstein, that is from a tradition of Lebensphilosophie that appears to be incompatible with Agamben's theological thesis."''&lt;ref&gt;Matteo Pasquinelli, "What an Apparatus is Not: On the Archeology of the Norm in Foucault, Canguilhem, and Goldstein". Parrhesia 22,  2015, 79-89. [http://matteopasquinelli.com/what-an-apparatus-is-not/ PDF]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Fichtelite''' is a rare white mineral found in [[fossil]]ized wood from [[Bavaria]]. It crystallizes in the [[monoclinic]] [[crystal system]]. It is a cyclic [[hydrocarbon]]: [[7-Isopropyl-1,4a-dimethyl-dodecahydro-1H-phenanthrene|dimethyl-isopropyl-perhydrophenanthrene]], C&lt;sub&gt;19&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;34&lt;/sub&gt;. It is very soft with a [[Mohs hardness]] of 1, the same as [[talc]]. Its [[specific gravity]] is very low at 1.032, just slightly denser than water.

It was first described in 1841 and named for the location, [[Fichtel Mountains|Fichtelgebirge]], [[Bavaria]], [[Germany]].&lt;ref name=Mindat/&gt; It has been reported from [[fossil]]ized pine wood from a [[peat bog]] and in organic-rich modern marine [[sediment]]s.&lt;ref name=Handbook/&gt;

'''''Fire in the Blood''''' is a 2013 [[documentary film]] by [[Dylan Mohan Gray]] depicting the intentional obstruction of access to low-cost [[antiretroviral drug]]s used in the treatment of [[HIV/AIDS]] to people in [[Africa]] and other parts the global south, driven by multinational pharmaceutical companies holding [[patent]] monopolies and various Western governments (above all those of the United States, [[European Union]] and Switzerland) consistently doing these companies' bidding. The film details how the battle against this genocidal blockade, estimated to have resulted in no less than ten- to twelve million completely unnecessary deaths, was fought and (at least temporarily) won.

''Fire in the Blood'' features contributions from former US President [[Bill Clinton]], intellectual property activist [[James Love (NGO director)|James Love]], global health reporter [[Donald McNeil, Jr.]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'', HIV/AIDS treatment activist [[Zackie Achmat]], pioneering generic drugmaker [[Yusuf Hamied]], former [[Pfizer]] executive-turned-[[whistleblower]] [[Peter Rost (doctor)|Peter Rost]], Ugandan AIDS [[physician]] [[Peter Mugyenyi]], and [[Nobel Prize]]-laureates [[Desmond Tutu]] and [[Joseph Stiglitz]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Where AIDS Steals Life by the Millions |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/06/movies/fire-in-the-blood-spotlights-aids-in-africa.html?_r=0 |newspaper=New York Times |author= Miriam Bale|date= 5 September 2013|accessdate=2013-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=mint/&gt;

The film is narrated by [[Academy Award]]-winning actor [[William Hurt]], who lent his voice to the film on a ''[[pro bono]]'' basis because he felt the story and subject matter were so important.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}

In November 2013, ''Fire in the Blood'' set a new all-time record for the longest theatrical run by any non-fiction feature film in Indian history (five weeks).&lt;ref name="bollyspice.com"&gt;[http://bollyspice.com/70483/indian-documentary-fire-blood-breaks-record-longest-run-indian-cinemas Bolly Spice, 2 November 2013: ''Indian cocumentary Fire in the Blood breaks record for longest run in Indian cinemas] Re-linked 2014-11-01&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=shorenews&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.shorenewstoday.com/snt/news/index.php/regional/events/51565-documentary-on-aids-drugs-to-be-shown-at-pac-.html | newspaper=Shore News Today | date=23 April 2014 | title=Documentary on AIDS drugs to be shown at PAC | accessdate=1 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was also the first Indian non-fiction feature to be theatrically released in either the US or the UK.&lt;ref name=shorenews/&gt;

In November 2018, legendary Australian journalist and documentary filmmaker [[John Pilger]] included ''Fire in the Blood'' among his selection of "26 landmark documentary films of the past seven decades".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.mca.com.au/whats-on/the-power-of-the-documentary/]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Production==
Filmmaker [[Dylan Mohan Gray]] first came to know of the issue in 2004, after he read an article in ''[[The Economist]]'' about the battle between pharmaceutical companies and the global public health community over access to lower-cost AIDS drugs for Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = Fire in the blood for Indian pharma firms |publisher= Business Standard| url = http://www.business-standard.com/article/companies/fire-in-the-blood-for-indian-pharma-firms-113093000774_1.html|date=1 October 2013| accessdate = 2013-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; He decided to make the film three years later.&lt;ref name=ibn/&gt;

The film was shot on four continents from March 2008 to the end of 2010, while editing was completed in 2012.&lt;ref name=mint&gt;{{cite web| title = Fire in the Blood: Big Trouble for Big Pharma |publisher= Livemint| url = http://www.livemint.com/Leisure/zIWnlM65fmopukcVcgcq8L/Fire-in-the-Blood.html|date=3 October 2013|accessdate = 2013-11-08|author=Nandini Ramnath}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Release==
The film was first released theatrically in Ireland on 21 February 2013, with the UK premiere the following day. It was released theatrically in the US on 7 September 2013 and in India on 11 October the same year, to outstanding reviews.&lt;ref name=ibn&gt;{{cite web

The film was released on the [[iTunes]] UK Store in mid-2013, and worldwide on [[Video on Demand|VOD]] via its website in 2014.  It released in the UK and India on [[DVD]] in the first quarter of 2014.

Thus far the film has been broadcast on [[television]] in the following countries, beginning in late 2013: Finland ([[YLE]]), Israel ([[Yes (Israel)]]), Norway ([[NRK]]), Spain ([[Televisión Española|TVE]]), Switzerland ([[Schweizer Radio und Fernsehen|SRF]]), Austria ([[ORF (broadcaster)|ORF]]), Poland ([[Telewizja Polska]]), Ireland ([[TG4]]), Brazil ([[Globosat]]), Denmark ([[Danmarks Radio|DR]]), the United States ([[Audience Network]]) and Japan ([[NHK]]).  Transnational broadcasters include [[Al Jazeera English|AJE]], [[Al Jazeera Arabic]] and [[Al Jazeera Balkans]], along with [[DStv]] and GOtv across Sub-Saharan Africa as part of the "AfriDocs" initiative.

''Fire in the Blood'' was the first Indian film to be selected for the World Cinema Documentary competition at the [[Sundance Film Festival]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.frontline.in/social-issues/indian-generics-and-aids/article5228850.ece?homepage=true Frontline, 1 November 2013: ''Indian generics and AIDS''] Re-linked 2014-11-01&lt;/ref&gt; and subsequently participated in over 100 leading [[film festivals]] in dozens of countries all over the world.&lt;ref name=WebsiteReviews&gt;[http://fireintheblood.com/festivals Official website: ''Festivals''] Re-linked 2014-11-01&lt;/ref&gt;

==Critical response==
''Fire in the Blood'' received very positive critical notices, both to its North American premiere at the 2013 [[Sundance Film Festival]], as well as to its subsequent theatrical releases in Ireland, [[United Kingdom|Britain]], the United States and India.&lt;ref name=WebsiteReviews/&gt;

The influential film [[review aggregator]] website [[Rotten Tomatoes]] has given ''Fire in the Blood'' a "92% fresh" rating based on 24 reviews as of January 2014.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/fire_in_the_blood/&lt;/ref&gt;  This ranks the film within the 5-10% best-reviewed films of 2013.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.rottentomatoes.com/top/bestofrt/?year=2013&lt;/ref&gt;

Certain critics, such as Gary Goldstein of the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', while acknowledging the enormous importance of the topic, felt the film should have taken a more emotional approach to its "incendiary subject".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/moviesnow/la-et-mn-fire-in-the-blood-review,0,1351271.story#axzz2nvwblex9&lt;/ref&gt; Many others, however, such as the legendary English critic [[Philip French]], who in his review for ''[[The Observer]]'' described the film as "quietly devastating", praised Gray's choice in avoiding a [[polemical]] tone and allowing the material to speak for itself.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/feb/24/fire-in-the-blood-review&lt;/ref&gt;

Writing in ''[[Sight &amp; Sound]]'', Ashley Clark called ''Fire in the Blood'' "stirring" and added "Gray deserves credit for his own restraint... Such is the clarity of his ideological stance that any grandstanding would feel redundant."&lt;ref&gt;Sight &amp; Sound, Review: Fire in the Blood, March 2013, p. 94.&lt;/ref&gt;

David Rooney of ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' echoed this view, stating that "the admirable balance between impassioned argument and clear-sighted reporting in Dylan Mohan Gray's chronicle of the why and how makes ''Fire in the Blood'' indispensable viewing", adding that the "very smart", "extremely moving" film is "a shocking account of international trade terrorism sanctioned by Western governments" and "a powerful documentary that demands to be seen by as wide an audience as possible."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/review/fire-blood-sundance-review-413424&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other reactions==
Author [[John le Carré]] (who became involved with the issue of pharmaceutical company abuses while researching his landmark 2001 novel ''[[The Constant Gardener]]'') called ''Fire in the Blood'' "a blessing... full of conviction, passion and unanswerable argument".&lt;ref&gt;Letter from John le Carré to Dylan Mohan Gray, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

Australian-British journalist and documentary film maker, [[John Pilger]] wrote "''Fire in the Blood''  is one of the most powerful, important and humane documentaries I have ever seen. It's the story of ordinary people standing up to unaccountable power. The struggle to save millions from the ravages of untreated HIV is revealed as a struggle against the new lords of the world, transnational corporations, their greed and lies. Genuine hope is rare these days -- you'll find it in this film."

Former (2001–06) [[United Nations]] (UN) Special Envoy for HIV/AIDS in Africa [[Stephen Lewis]] said "I was enraged as I watched, thinking of those years I spent as the Envoy, watching people die. [...] I rarely watch 'AIDS documentaries'; they're remarkably repetitive as a rule, largely uninspired and yielding almost nothing new. [Fire in the Blood] is in a wholly different category; a terrific, riveting documentary... dramatic, compelling, but most of all, wonderfully humane. [Gray is] a remarkably gifted documentary film-maker."

==Special screenings==
Special screenings of ''Fire in the Blood'' for policymakers have been held in such fora as the [[United Nations]] headquarters in [[New York City]] and [[Vienna]], the [[European Parliament]] in [[Brussels]], the [[World Health Assembly]] and [[UNAIDS]] headquarters in [[Geneva]], along with dedicated screenings for lawmakers in [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]] and [[New Delhi]], and one hosted by the Indian Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) for ambassadors and consuls accredited to India.

'''Franco Andrea Bonelli''' (10 November 1784 – 18 November 1830) was an [[Italy|Italian]] [[ornithology|ornithologist]], [[entomologist]]  and collector.

==Life==
Very little is known about the early life of Bonelli: he was born in [[Cuneo]] and was interested from an early age in the fauna which surrounded him, making collecting trips,  preparing specimens and noting his observations.

He became a  member of the [[Reale Società Agraria di Torino]] in 1807 when he presented his first studies relating to the [[Coleoptera]] of [[Piedmont]]. The high quality of these studies attracted the interest of the naturalists of his time.

In April 1810, [[George Vat]] was sent to [[Turin]] by the French government to reorganize the [[University of Turin]] and begin its fusion with the [[University of France|Impériale University]] founded by [[Napoleon]]. Vat was very impressed by Bonelli’s knowledge. Vat encouraged him to further his knowledge by coming to follow courses at the [[Muséum national d'Histoire naturelle|Natural History Museum]] in [[Paris]]. 
[[File:A history of the birds of Europe (Plate 50) (8157805947).jpg|thumb|[[Bonelli's warbler (disambiguation)|Bonelli's warbler]]&lt;!--intentional link to DAB page, the two species look almost identical--&gt; is named after Franco Andrea Bonelli]]

Bonelli took this advice so as obtain a professor’s chair in the new university. In September 1810, he arrived in Paris.

In 1811, Bonelli was finally named professor of zoology at the [[University of Turin]] and keeper of the natural history museum of zoology.  During his time at the university, he formed one of the largest ornithological collections in Europe.

In 1811, Bonelli wrote a ''Catalogue of the Birds of Piedmont'', in which he described 262 species. In 1815, he discovered the bird [[Western Bonelli's warbler|Bonelli's warbler]] (''Phylloscopus bonelli''), named by [[Louis Vieillot]] in 1819. In the same year, he discovered [[Bonelli's eagle]] (''Hieraaetus fasciatus'') that was likewise named by Vieillot in 1822.

The successor of Bonelli at the Turin Museum was [[Carlo Giuseppe Gené]].

==Achievements==
Bonelli is most notable for his work on birds and on the beetle family [[Carabidae]]. Since he was an early worker on Coleoptera many of his [[Genus|genera]] later became [[Family (biology)|Families]], [[Subfamily (biology)|sub families]] and [[Tribe (biology)|tribes]]. Also many of his genera survive.

Instances are the:

*Omophroninae; Pseudomorphinae; Brachininae; Trechinae; [[Harpalinae]]; Pseudomorphinae; Siagoninae; Pterostichinae and Scaritinae - Subfamilies
*[[Dromiidae]] 1810 Family
* Pterostichini  Tribe

==Works==

*''Catalogue des Oiseaux du Piemont'' (1811).
*Observations Entomologique. Première partie. ''Mém. Acad. Sci. Turin'' 18: 21-78, Tabula Synoptica  (1810).
*Observations entomologiques. Deuxieme partie. ''Mém. Acad. Sci. Turin'' 20: 433-484  (1813)

The last two are founding works of entomology, introducing many new [[taxa]].

The '''Gibilmanna Observatory''' is a research station used for a diverse range of studies set up and run by the Istituto Nazionale di Geofisica e Vulcanologia (INGV)&lt;ref&gt;Istituto Nazionale di Geofisica e Vulcanologia (IGNV)&lt;/ref&gt; and it is located on Cozzo Timpa Rossa at 1005 m.a.s.l. near [[Cefalù]], a town in the district of [[Palermo]], [[Italy]].

It is one of the 120 stations of the Italian Magnetic Network&lt;ref&gt;Italian Magnetic Network&lt;/ref&gt; measuring Earth magnetism field in Italy, and in 2005 INGV's Centro Nazionale Terremoti (CNT) selected it to set up the OBS Lab &lt;ref&gt;D'Anna G. et al (2009), Il Nuovo OBS/H dell'INGV", Quaderni di Geofisica, n29, pag. 7&lt;/ref&gt; aimed at designing, manufacturing and managing the [[Ocean-Bottom Seismometer]] with Hydrophone (OBS/H), later deployed for monitoring the Marsili submarine volcano in the [[Tyrrhenian sea]].

In addition, the observatory is one of the 110 Data Collection Platform (D.C.P.)&lt;ref&gt;Data Collection Platform (DCP)&lt;/ref&gt; stations of the [[Aeronautica Militare Italiana]] for automatic weather data gathering and transmission to the [[METEOSAT]] satellite.
Since 1976 this station has also been equipped for Ionospheric research and it is the most southern station of its kind in Europe. Real time ionograms are recorded by the INGV own developed AIS-INGV ionosonde installed at the station and reported on the INGV ionospheric website.&lt;ref&gt;Ionospheric Station of Gibilmanna&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3654">The '''global distance test (GDT)''', also written as '''GDT TS''' to represent "total score",  is a measure of similarity between two [[protein structure]]s with identical [[amino acid sequence]]s but different [[tertiary structure]]s. It is most commonly used to compare the results of [[protein structure prediction]] to the experimentally determined structure as measured by [[X-ray crystallography]] or [[protein NMR]]. The metric is intended as a more accurate measurement than the more common [[Root mean square deviation (bioinformatics)|RMSD]] metric, which is sensitive to [[outlier]] regions created by poor modeling of individual [[loop (biochemistry)|loop]] regions in a structure that is otherwise reasonably accurate. GDT_TS measurements are used as major assessment criteria in the production of results from the [[CASP|Critical Assessment of Structure Prediction]] (CASP), a large-scale experiment in the structure prediction community dedicated to assessing current modeling techniques and identifying their primary deficiencies.&lt;ref name="Zemla1999"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Zemla A, Venclovas C, Moult J, Fidelis K |year=1999 |title=Processing and analysis of CASP3 protein structure predictions |journal=Proteins |volume=S3 |pages=22–29 |pmid=10526349|doi=10.1002/(sici)1097-0134(1999)37:3 &lt;22::aid-prot5&gt;3.3.co;2-n }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Zemla2001"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Zemla A, Venclovas C, Moult J, Fidelis K |year=2001 |title=Processing and evaluation of predictions in CASP4 |journal=Proteins |volume=45 |issue=S5 |pages=13–21 |pmid=11835478 |doi=10.1002/prot.10052}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Zemla2003"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Zemla A |year=2003 |title=LGA: A method for finding 3D similarities in protein structures |journal=Nucleic Acids Research |volume=31 |issue=13 |pages=3370–3374 |pmid=12824330 |pmc=168977 |doi=10.1093/nar/gkg571}}&lt;/ref&gt; In general, the higher GDT_TS is, the better a given model is in comparison to reference structure.

The GDT score is calculated as the largest set of [[amino acid]] residues' [[alpha carbon]] atoms in the model structure falling within a defined distance cutoff of their position in the experimental structure. It is typical to calculate the GDT score under several cutoff distances, and scores generally increase with increasing cutoff. A plateau in this increase may indicate an extreme divergence between the experimental and predicted structures, such that no additional atoms are included in any cutoff of a reasonable distance.

The high accuracy version of the GDT measure is called GDT-HA. It uses smaller cut off distances (half the size of GDT_TS) and thus is more rigorous.&lt;ref name="Read2007"&gt;{{cite journal |first=Randy J. |last=Read |author2=Chavali, Gayatri |title=Assessment of CASP7 predictions in the high accuracy template-based modeling category |journal=Proteins |volume=69 |issue=S8 |pages=27–37 |doi= 10.1002/prot.21662 |year=2007 |pmid=17894351}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Gloss light Illuminates.jpg|Gloss light Illuminates|thumb|Gloss reflection]]
'''Gloss''' is an [[optical]] property which indicates how well a surface reflects light in a [[specular]] (mirror-like) direction. It is one of important parameters that are used to describe the [[visual appearance]] of an object. The factors that affect gloss are the refractive index of the material, the angle of incident light and the surface [[topography]].

Apparent gloss depends on the amount of ''specular'' reflection – light reflected from the surface in an equal amount and the symmetrical angle to the one of incoming light – in comparison with [[diffuse reflection|''diffuse'' reflection]] – the amount of light scattered into other directions.

==Theory==
[[File:Lambert2.gif|thumb|right|Specular and diffuse reflection]]
When light illuminates an object, it interacts with it in a number of ways:

* Absorbed within it (largely responsible for colour)
* Transmitted through it (dependent on the surface transparency and opacity) 
* Scattered from or within it (diffuse reflection, haze and transmission)
* Specularly reflected from it (gloss)

Variations in surface texture directly influence the level of specular reflection. Objects with a smooth surface, i.e. highly polished or containing coatings with finely dispersed pigments, appear shiny to the eye due to a large amount of light being reflected in a specular direction whilst rough surfaces reflect no specular light as the light is scattered in other directions and therefore appears dull. The image forming qualities of these surfaces are much lower making any reflections appear blurred and distorted.

Substrate material type also influences the gloss of a surface. Non-metallic materials, i.e. plastics etc. produce a higher level of reflected light when illuminated at a greater illumination angle due to light being absorbed into the material or being diffusely scattered depending on the colour of the material. Metals do not suffer from this effect producing higher amounts of reflection at any angle.

The Fresnel formula gives the specular reflectance, &lt;math&gt; R_s &lt;/math&gt;, for an unpolarized light of [[intensity (physics)|intensity]] &lt;math&gt; I_0 &lt;/math&gt;, at angle of incidence &lt;math&gt; i &lt;/math&gt;, giving the intensity of specularly reflected beam of intensity &lt;math&gt; I_r &lt;/math&gt;, while the refractive index of the surface specimen is &lt;math&gt; m &lt;/math&gt;.

The [[Fresnel equation]] is given as follows : &lt;math&gt; R_s = \frac{I_r}{I_0} &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; R_s = \frac{1}{2} \left[\left(\frac{\cos i - \sqrt{m^2 - \sin^2 i}}{\cos i + \sqrt{m^2 - \sin^2 i}}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{m^2 \cos i - \sqrt{m^2 - \sin^2 i}}{m^2 \cos i + \sqrt{m^2 - \sin^2 i}}\right)^2\right]&lt;/math&gt;

===Surface roughness===

[[Image:Nanorough.gif|right|thumb|300px|Figure1:Specular reflection of light from a rough surface]]

Surface roughness in micrometer range influences the specular reflectance levels. The diagram on the right depicts the reflection at an angle &lt;math&gt; i &lt;/math&gt; on a rough surface with a characteristic roughness height &lt;math&gt; h &lt;/math&gt;. The path difference between rays reflected from the top and bottom of the surface bumps is:

:&lt;math&gt;\Delta r = 2h \cos i \;&lt;/math&gt;

When the wavelength of the light is &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt;, the phase difference will be:
:&lt;math&gt;\Delta \phi = \frac{4\pi h \cos i}{\lambda} \;&lt;/math&gt;

If &lt;math&gt;\Delta \phi \;&lt;/math&gt; is small, the two beams (see Figure 1) are nearly in phase and therefore the specimen surface can be considered smooth. But when &lt;math&gt;\Delta \phi = \pi \;&lt;/math&gt;, then beams are not in phase and through interference, cancellation of each other will occur. Low intensity of specularly reflected light means the surface is rough and it scatters the light in other directions. If an arbitrary criterion for smooth surface is &lt;math&gt;\Delta \phi &lt; \frac{\pi}{2} &lt;/math&gt;, then substitution into the equation above will produce:

:&lt;math&gt; h &lt; \frac {\lambda}{8 \cos i} \;&lt;/math&gt; 

This smooth surface condition is known as the Rayleigh criterion.

===History===

The earliest studies of gloss perception are attributed to Ingersoll&lt;ref&gt;Ingersoll Elec. World 63,645 (1914), Elec. World 64, 35 (1915); Paper 27, 18 (Feb. 9, 1921), and U. S. Patent 1225250 (May 8, 1917)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ingersoll R. S., The Glarimeter, “An instrument for measuring the gloss of paper”. J.Opt. Soc. Am. 5.213 (1921)&lt;/ref&gt; who in 1914 examined the effect of gloss on paper. By quantitatively measuring gloss using instrumentation Ingersoll based his research around the theory that light is polarised in specular reflection whereas diffusely reflected light is non-polarized. The Ingersoll “glarimeter” had a specular geometry with incident and viewing angles at 57.5°. Using this configuration gloss was measured using a contrast method which subtracted the specular component from the total reflectance using a polarizing filter.

In the 1930s work by A. H. Pfund,&lt;ref&gt;A. H. Pfund, ”The measurement of gloss“, J. Opt. Soc. Am. 20, 23.23 (1930)&lt;/ref&gt; suggested that although specular shininess is the basic (objective) evidence of gloss, actual surface glossy appearance (subjective) relates to the contrast between specular shininess and the diffuse light of the surrounding surface area (now called “contrast gloss” or “luster”).

If black and white surfaces of the same shininess are visually compared, the black surface will always appear glossier because of the greater contrast between the specular highlight and the black surroundings as compared to that with white surface and surroundings. Pfund was also the first to suggest that more than one method was needed to analyze gloss correctly.

In 1937 Hunter,&lt;ref&gt;Hunter, R. S., “Methods of determining gloss”, RP958 J. Res. NBS, Volume 18 (1937)&lt;/ref&gt; as part of his research paper on gloss, described six different visual criteria attributed to apparent gloss. The following diagrams show the relationships between an incident beam of light, I, a specularly reflected beam, S, a diffusely reflected beam, D and a near-specularly reflected beam, B. 

* Specular gloss – the perceived brightness and the brilliance of highlights

[[File:Specular gloss.jpg|Specular gloss]]

Defined as the ratio of the light reflected from a surface at an equal but opposite angle to that incident on the surface.

* Sheen – the perceived shininess at low grazing angles 

[[File:Sheen.jpg|Sheen]]

Defined as the gloss at grazing angles of incidence and viewing

* Contrast gloss – the perceived brightness of specularly and diffusely reflecting areas

[[File:Contrast gloss.jpg|Contrast gloss]]

Defined as the ratio of the specularly reflected light to that diffusely reflected normal to the surface;

* Absence of bloom – the perceived cloudiness in reflections near the specular direction

[[File:Absence of bloom.jpg|Absence of bloom]]

Defined as a measure of the absence of haze or a milky appearance adjacent to the specularly reflected light: haze is the inverse of absence-of-bloom

* Distinctness of image gloss – identified by the distinctness of images reflected in surfaces

[[File:Distinctness of image gloss.jpg|Distinctness of image gloss]]

Defined as the sharpness of the specularly reflected light

* Surface texture gloss – identified by the lack of surface texture and surface blemishes

Defined as the uniformity of the surface in terms of visible texture and defects (orange peel, scratches, inclusions etc.)

A surface can therefore appear very shiny if it has a well-defined specular reflectance at the specular angle. The perception of an image reflected in the surface can be degraded by appearing unsharp, or by appearing to be of low contrast. The former is characterised by the measurement of the distinctness-of-image and the latter by the haze or contrast gloss.

[[File:Gloss-samples.gif|Gloss-samples]]

In his paper Hunter also noted the importance of three main factors in the measurement of gloss:
* The amount of light reflected in the specular direction 
* The amount and way in which the light is spread around the specular direction 
* The change in specular reflection as the specular angle changes

For his research he used a [[glossmeter]] with a specular angle of 45° as did most of the first photoelectric methods of that type, later studies however by Hunter and Judd in 1939,&lt;ref&gt;Judd, D B (1937), Gloss and glossiness. Am. Dyest. Rep. 26, 234–235 &lt;/ref&gt; on a larger number of painted samples, concluded that the 60 degree geometry was the best angle to use so as to provide the closest correlation to a visual observation.

===Standard gloss measurement===

Standardisation in gloss measurement was led by Hunter and ASTM (American Society for Testing and Materials) who produced ASTM D523 Standard test method for specular gloss in 1939. This incorporated a method for measuring gloss at a specular angle of 60°. Later editions of the Standard (1951) included methods for measuring at 20° for evaluating high gloss finishes, developed at the DuPont Company (Horning and Morse, 1947) and 85° (matte, or low, gloss).
 
ASTM has a number of other gloss-related standards designed for application in specific industries including the old 45° method which is used primarily now used for glazed ceramics, polyethylene and other plastic films. 

In 1937, the paper industry adopted a 75° specular-gloss method because the angle gave the best separation of coated book papers.&lt;ref&gt;Institute of Paper Chemistry (1937); Hunter (1958)&lt;/ref&gt; This method was adopted in 1951 by the Technical Association of Pulp and Paper Industries as TAPPI Method T480.

In the paint industry, measurements of the specular gloss are made according to International Standard ISO 2813 (BS 3900, Part 5, UK; DIN 67530, Germany; NFT 30-064, France; AS 1580, Australia; JIS Z8741, Japan, are also equivalent). This standard is essentially the same as ASTM D523 although differently drafted. 

Studies of polished metal surfaces and anodised aluminium automotive trim in the 1960s by Tingle,&lt;ref&gt;Tingle, W. H., and Potter, F. R., “New Instrument Grades for Polished Metal Surfaces,” Product Engineering, Vol 27, March 1961.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tingle, W. H., and George, D. J., “Measuring Appearance Characteristics of Anodized Aluminum Automotive Trim,” Report No. 650513, Society of Automotive Engineers, May 1965.&lt;/ref&gt; Potter and George led to the standardisation of gloss measurement of high gloss surfaces by goniophotometry under the designation ASTM E430. In this standard it also defined methods for the measurement of distinctness of image gloss and reflection haze.

'''Hans Karl Oskar Stubbe''' (7 March 1902 - 14 May 1989) was a German [[agronomist]] and [[plant breeder]]. During the [[World War II|Second World War]] he was dismissed by the [[Government of Nazi Germany|Nazi government]] from the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Breeding Research in [[Müncheberg]] in 1936. After the war he went to work in [[East Germany]] where he was the founding director of the Institute for Cultivated Plant Research (which started as the Institut für Kulturpflanzenforschung in Vienna) in [[Gatersleben]]. He stood up against the ideas of [[Trofim Lysenko]] and prevented East German genetics from being influenced by politics that had caused damage in the [[Soviet Union]]. 
[[File:2445 HU LaWi Stubbe AMA fec.JPG|thumb|left|upright|Head cast of Hans Stubbe]]
Stubbe was born in 1902 at Berlin where his father was a school inspector. He studied agriculture and biology at the [[University of Göttingen]] and the [[Agricultural University of Berlin]]. He became a student of  [[Erwin Baur]] at the Institute for Inheritance Research in Berlin where he worked on a doctoral thesis on mutagenesis in 1929. He then joined the newly established Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Breeding Research in Müncheberg but after about nine years he was dismissed when the Nazi party came into power. For a while he worked with [[Fritz von Wettstein]] at the Institut für Kulturpflanzenforschung in Vienna. Wettstein wished to recruit [[Elisabeth Schiemann]] to head the institute but Stubbe objected to the idea of men working under her. He made major expeditions to collect [[germplasm]] of wild and cultivated plants from around Europe both with civilian and military objectives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/S1360-1385(02)02333-6|pmid=12234735|title=Science and politics: Hans Stubbe and the Institute of Plant Genetics and Crop Plant Research at Gatersleben|journal=Trends in Plant Science|volume=7|issue=9|pages=418|year=2002|last1=Wobus|first1=Ulrich|last2=Schubert|first2=Ingo}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stubbe worked on using X-rays to produce useful mutations in barley. Along with Gustav Becker and Kurt Mothes, Stubbe ensured that [[Lysenkoism]] did not take root in East Germany.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| title=How did East German genetics avoid Lysenkoism?|first= Rudolf |last= Hagemann| url= http://lysvav.narod.ru/Files/Hagemann.pdf|pages=320–324| volume=18| issue=9| year=2002|journal=Trends in Genetics}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=heim&gt;{{cite book|pages=166–171|title=Plant Breeding and Agrarian Research in Kaiser-Wilhelm-Institutes 1933-1945| author=Heim, Susanne| publisher=Springer| year= 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite his anti-fascist views, Stubbe defended his friend [[Günther Niethammer]] and wrote a letter in 1947 exonerating the latter of any  wilful participation with the Nazis at Auschwitz. After the Second World War Stubbe became director of the Institute for Cultivated Plant Research in Gatersleben. Stubbe died in 1989 in Zingst. He was succeeded at Gatersleben by his student Helmut Böhme.&lt;ref name=heim /&gt;

'''Hooke Crater''' is an impact crater in the [[Argyre quadrangle]] on Mars at 45.2°S and 44.4°W and is 139.0&amp;nbsp;km in diameter and is in the north of [[Argyre Planitia]] lying next to the [[Nereidum Montes]].  Its name was approved in 1973, and it was named after [[Robert Hooke]].&lt;ref&gt;https://planetarynames.wr.usgs.gov/nomenclature/SearchResults;jsessionid=5B318C6B158968CC43C2B4987780B8D6&lt;/ref&gt; The crater is the deepest point in the Argyre Plantia and in the Argyre quadrangle.

Nearby prominent crater is [[Galle (Martian crater)|Galle]] to the southeast and further west is [[Halley (Martian crater)|Halley]]. Surrounding Hooke are smaller named craters on the rim including Yungay to the north, Podor in the northeast and Wau to the east. Touching the northwest rim is Taza and the east rim is Camiri. NNE is the smaller Rengo.  Other nearby minor craters include Luga and the tiny Gandu to the west and further southwest is Cypress.

Some of the dunes have gullies on them.  While these gullies may be a bit different then ones found on crater walls and other steep slopes, they have been thought by some to be caused by flowing water.

In finance, '''intermediated research''' is a type of [[fundamental analysis]] or [[investment analysis]] of a business to establish its value for [[Investor|investors]] that attempts to avoid commercial pressure or influence.

Many banks and [[broker]]s provide research to the investment community, however this form of research suffers from a real or perceived lack of [[objectivity (science)|objectivity]]. For example, this research may be subject to influence from within a bank from, say, investment bankers keen to win company’s [[IPO]] mandate.

An alternative form is known as ''[[Independent study|independent research]]'' or ''alternative research'', this is research that is that is not provided by a bank or broker. However, someone has to fund the costs of conducting the research, and when the funder is the company being researched, this form of independent research is termed “[[Sponsor (legislative)|sponsored]]” or “company-paid” research. Unfortunately, with the subject company paying directly for these services, this form of research suffers from a real or perceived lack of [[objectivity (science)|objectivity]], which reduces its value to [[Investor|investors]] and hence to the companies themselves.

Intermediated research improves significantly upon the sponsored research model, by introducing important [[Safeguard|safeguards]] into the commercial and research process framework. The key structure is that the company has no choice in its allocation to a research provider; once matched with the research provider, the company is under a long term contract in order to minimize commercial pressure or influence; and the fees paid to the research provider are not sufficiently material for the company to be able to exert any influence over the content or conclusions of the [[Securities research|research report]]. Collectively, these measures enhance the value of the report to investors and consequently, to the company itself.

The intermediated research framework includes the further protections; ensuring that the independent research firms involved have no [[investment banking]] or [[Brokerage firm|brokerage]] operations in their [[business model]]s; conduct no traditional company-paid research; deliver a standard template for analysis of every company so that all standard topics are covered; and avoiding ratings and [[Targetprocess|target prices]] in the reports, since these can risk becoming a focus of pressure exerted on the research provider by the subject company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.irideus.org/intermediated_research |title=What is Intermediated Research? |publisher=Irideus Intermediate Research Initiative |accessdate=September 30, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He is associated with a [[zij]] in Persian which has been lost but was translated into Chinese in 1383 by [[Ma‐shayihei]] with the title ''Huihuilifa'' (Islamic calendar).

'''Jörgen Erik Lehmann''' (15 January 1898 &amp;ndash; 26 December 1989) was a [[Denmark|Danish]]-born [[Sweden|Swedish]] [[physician]] and [[chemist]] best known for his discovery in the 1940s that [[para-amino salicylic acid]] (PAS) would make an excellent orally-available [[tuberculosis]] therapy. PAS was, together with [[streptomycin]], the first efficacious anti-microbial therapy for tuberculosis and remained in clinical use for several decades. In 1941, Lehmann also developed the [[anti-coagulant]] [[dicumarol]], which is used for the prevention of [[blood clots]] and in the treatment of [[deep venous thrombosis]].

Lehmann studied under [[Torsten Thunberg]], [[professor]] of [[physiology]] in [[Lund]], who discovered the [[dehydrogenase]]s. Lehmann was appointed professor of physiology in [[Aarhus]] in 1937, and became head of the central laboratory at the [[Sahlgrenska University Hospital]] in Gothenburg 1938. After retiring in 1963, Lehmann continued his research at the [[Nobel Laureate]] [[Arvid Carlsson]]'s institution at the [[University of Gothenburg]].

Jörgen Lehmann was son of [[Edvard Lehmann (historian)|Edvard Lehmann]], professor of History of Religions at [[Lund University]] and grandnephew of the Danish politician [[Orla Lehmann]].

At first, European research teams were honored, but since 2005, only individuals qualify.&lt;ref&gt;Körber Foundation: „Excellent Brains. 25 Years of Cutting-Edge Science” 2009, p. 4 et seq.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Selection process==
Candidates for the prize need not be from Europe, but they must be living in Europe.&lt;ref name="guidelines"&gt;{{citation|title=Guidelines for the awarding of the Körber European Science Prize|url=http://www.koerber-stiftung.de/fileadmin/user_upload/wissenschaft/koerber-preis/pdf/Guidelines%20of%20the%20Koerber%20European%20Science%20Prize%202011.pdf|format=pdf|date=June 2011|publisher=Körber-Stiftung|accessdate=5 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Renowned scientists from all over Europe, grouped into two Search Committees, select promising candidates. The awards are annual and alternate between the life and physical sciences. Those who are shortlisted are then asked to submit a detailed proposal for a research project which is then judged in two rounds of assessment by the Search Committee. The work of the Search Committee is supported by international experts. A maximum of five candidates are subsequently recommended to the Trustee Committee which, based on a summary of expert assessments, previous publications and scientific career history, decides on the new prizewinner. A personal application is not allowed.

== Prize money==
All prizewinners receive a certificate and 750,000 euro prize money. The prizewinners can keep 10 percent of the money for themselves and must spend the rest on research in Europe in three to five years. Aside from these restrictions they alone can decide how to use the money.&lt;ref name="guidelines"/&gt;

== Presentation==
The prize is presented every year in the Great Hall of [[Hamburg Rathaus|Hamburg City Hall]] in the presence of the Mayor of the Free and Hanseatic City of Hamburg and 600 guests from science, industry, politics, and society.

'''Laurance R. Doyle''' (born 1953) is an American scientist who received his Ph.D. from the [[Ruprecht Karl University of Heidelberg]]. He has worked at the [[SETI Institute]] since 1987 where he is a principal investigator and astrophysicist. His main area of study has been the formation and detection of [[extrasolar planets]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.springerlink.com/(yggavx45p0uthu55gflyqz55)/app/home/contribution.asp?referrer=parent&amp;backto=issue,11,12;journal,10,210;linkingpublicationresults,1:400258,1]&lt;/ref&gt; but he has also worked on communications theory. In particular he has written on how patterns in animal communication relate to humans with an emphasis on [[cetaceans]].

He grew up on a [[dairy farm]] in [[Cambria, California]] and therefore, didn't have much access to information about [[star]]s. But by reading books at the local library, Doyle was able to develop his knowledge in [[astronomy]], and eventually obtain his [[Bachelor's degree|Bachelor]]'s and [[Master's degree|Master]]'s of Science degrees in astronomy from [[San Diego State University]].

His first job was at the [[Jet Propulsion Laboratory]] as an imaging engineer, where he was in charge of analyzing pictures of [[Jupiter]] and [[Saturn]] sent from the spacecraft [[Voyager program|Voyager]]. He moved to [[Heidelberg]], Germany, to help analyze images of [[Halley's Comet]]. He got his doctorate in [[Astrophysics]] at the [[University of Heidelberg]].

In May 2005, he appeared on a [[National Geographic Channel]] special titled  ''Extraterrestrial.''  He also appeared in the episode "Will We Survive First Contact," of [[The Science Channel]] series titled ''Morgan Freeman's Through the Wormhole''.

Doyle is currently seeking to compare [[dolphin]] whistles and baby [[Babbling|babble]] in an attempt to make predictions about [[Extraterrestrial life|extraterrestrial]] communications. He believes that by measuring the complexity of communications for different species on Earth, we could get a good indication of how advanced an extraterrestrial signal is. His study determined that babies babble over 800 different sounds with the same amount of frequency as dolphins. As they grow older, those sounds decrease to around 50 and become more repetitious. The study found that baby dolphins develop similarly in regards to their whistling.

Doyle is faculty at Principia College and the founding Director of [http://www.principiacollege.edu/imop Principia College's Institute for the Metaphysics of Physics], founded in 2014.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="200181">This is a list of notable [[tornado]]es, [[tornado outbreak]]s, and [[tornado outbreak sequence]]s that have occurred in [[Canada]] in the 21st century. (2001 through 2100). Due to increasing detection, particularly in the US and southern Canada, numbers of counted tornadoes have increased markedly in recent decades although number of actual tornadoes and counted significant tornadoes has not. In older events, the number of tornadoes officially counted is likely underestimated.

On average, there are around 80 confirmed and unconfirmed tornadoes that touch down in Canada each year, with most occurring in [[Southern Ontario]], the southern [[Canadian Prairies]] and southern [[Quebec]]. Canada ranks as the second country in the world with the most tornadoes per year, after the US. The most common types are F0 to F2 in damage intensity level and usually result in minor structural damage to barns, wood fences, [[roof shingle]]s, chimneys, uprooted or snapped tree limbs and downed power lines. Fewer than 5% of tornadoes in Canada are rated F3 or higher in intensity, where wind speeds are in excess of {{convert|225|km/h|abbr=on}}. Prior to April 1, 2013, Canada used a slightly modified [[Fujita scale]], and as of that date the [[Enhanced Fujita scale]], again slightly modified, was put into use to rate tornado intensity, based on the damage to buildings and vegetation.&lt;ref name="ehfs"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://ec.gc.ca/meteo-weather/default.asp?lang=En&amp;n=41E875DA-1 |title=Enhanced Fujita Scale (EF-Scale) |access-date=2017-02-09 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170407223004/http://www.ec.gc.ca/meteo-weather/default.asp?lang=En&amp;n=41E875DA-1 |archive-date=2017-04-07 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ontario]], [[Alberta]], [[Manitoba]] and [[Saskatchewan]] all average 15 tornadoes per season, followed by Quebec with fewer than 10. [[New Brunswick]] and the [[British Columbia Interior]] are also recognized tornado zones. All other [[Provinces and territories of Canada|provinces and territories]] have significantly less threat from tornadoes. The peak season in Canada is in the summer months when clashing air masses move north, as opposed to the spring season in the United States southern-central plains, although tornadoes in Canada have occurred in spring, fall and very rarely winter.

The reported increase in numbers of tornadoes in recent years may reflect more reporting by citizens and media involvement rather than an actual increase in tornado occurrence (although some natural increase has not been ruled out), in addition to better detection technology i.e. [[Pulse-Doppler radar|Doppler]] [[weather radar]] and [[satellite imagery]]. The upswing could also be attributed to other factors, such as improved aerial and ground damage assessment after the fact in sparsely populated areas (particularly the case in remote parts of the Canadian Prairies and [[Northern Ontario]], for example), better trained spotter capabilities and increased use of digital recording devices by citizens. Tornadoes in Canada are enough of a threat for a [[Emergency population warning|public warning system]] to be in place, overseen by the national weather agency, [[Environment and Climate Change Canada|Environment Canada]] (EC).

For a variety of reasons, such as Canada's lower population density and generally stronger housing construction due to the colder climate, Canadian tornadoes have historically caused far fewer fatalities than tornadoes in the United States. The deadliest tornado in Canadian history, the [[Regina Cyclone]] of June 30, 1912, does not even rank in the top 25 when compared to American tornado fatalities. Urban centres are not immune from the threat of severe tornadoes. Nine medium to large size Canadian cities have been hit by significant strength tornadoes (F3 or higher), which caused large-scale damage and fatalities: [[Regina, Saskatchewan|Regina]] (1912); [[Windsor, Ontario|Windsor]] (1946 and 1974); [[Sarnia]] (1953); [[Greater Sudbury|Sudbury]] (1970); [[Woodstock, Ontario|Woodstock]] (1979); [[London, Ontario|London]] (1984); [[Barrie]] (1985); [[Edmonton]] (1987); [[Goderich, Ontario|Goderich]] (2011); and [[National Capital Region (Canada)|Ottawa-Gatineau]] (2018).

All figures for damages are in [[Canadian dollar]]s.

===2005===
* May 23 – a tornado touches down in and around [[Nipawin, Saskatchewan]].
*June 4 – several cold-core funnel clouds were spotted in [[Central Alberta|Central]] and [[Southern Alberta]]. Four of which briefly touched the ground. Several trees were damaged.
* June 21 – A severe thunderstorm spawned one tornado near [[Lethbridge, Alberta]]. Several funnel clouds and golf ball size hail was reported from Lethbridge to [[Taber, Alberta|Taber]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20121012232946/http://www.canada.com/story_print.html?id=e2fd1146-d04b-4a69-a3f1-4929033ebc19&amp;sponsor= Wild weather spawns tornadoes&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;
* July 2 – a tornado touched down about {{convert|25|km|abbr=on}} west of [[Estevan, Saskatchewan]].
* August 19 – [[Southern Ontario tornado outbreak of 2005]]. These associated storms caused extensive widespread damage in a path from [[Stratford, Ontario|Stratford]] ({{convert|20|km|abbr=on}} west of [[Kitchener, Ontario|Kitchener]]), to [[Peterborough, Ontario|Peterborough]], and along [[Georgian Bay]] near [[Collingwood, Ontario|Collingwood]]. A storm cell just to the north of [[Fergus, Ontario|Fergus]] spawned two F2 strength tornadoes that were particularly damaging, tearing apart trees, farms and overturning automobiles driving on a highway. The first tornado tracked through [[Perth East, Ontario|Milverton]] to [[Conestogo Lake]] (west of [[Elmira, Ontario|Elmira]]). The second moved from [[Salem, Wellington County|Salem]] to Lake Bellwood (north of [[Guelph]]). The same storm cell later triggered a [[tornado warning]] in [[Toronto]] and caused extensive flooding with over {{convert|140|mm|abbr=on}} of rain in some northern sections of the city, washing out many roads as well as damaging infrastructure such as storm sewers and electrical systems. An unusual tornado possibly touched down within the Toronto city limits, although never officially confirmed by Environment Canada. In its wake, the storm left a trail of damage that, according to the Insurance Bureau of Canada, represented the highest insured loss in the province's history, exceeding $500 million. That's more than two and a half times Ontario's losses during the infamous [[January 1998 North American ice storm|ice storm of 1998]] and the second largest loss event in Canadian history.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7547">This is a selected list of international [[academic conference]]s in the fields of [[distributed computing]], [[parallel computing]], and [[concurrent computing]].

== Selection criteria ==

The conferences listed here are major conferences of the area; they have been selected using the following criteria:-
# the notability of the conference has been confirmed by multiple independent sources; for example, it has been mentioned in textbooks&lt;ref name="lynch"&gt;[[Nancy Lynch|Nancy Ann Lynch]]: ''Distributed Algorithms'', Morgan Kaufmann, 1996, {{ISBN|978-1-55860-348-6}}. Section 1.4, "Bibliographic notes", mentions the following conferences: PODC, FOCS, STOC, SPAA, WDAG.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="tel"&gt;Gerard Tel: ''Introduction to Distributed Algorithms'', 2nd ed., Cambridge University Press, 2000, {{ISBN|978-0-521-79483-1}}. Sect. 1.3.3, "Research field", mentions the following conferences: PODC, WDAG/DISC, STOC, FOCS.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="georgiou"&gt;Chryssis Georgiou, Alexander A. Shvartsman: ''Do-All Computing in Distributed Systems: Cooperation in the Presence of Adversity'', Springer, 2007, {{ISBN|978-0-387-30918-7}}. Section "Bibliographic notes" in "Preface" mentions the following conferences: PODC, SPAA, STOC, SODA, FOCS, ICDCS, DISC, OPODIS, SIROCCO.&lt;/ref&gt; or other sources,&lt;ref name="podc-mailinglist"&gt;[[Symposium on Principles of Distributed Computing|PODC]] [http://www.podc.org/podc-mailinglist.txt mailing list instructions] mention the following conferences (in addition to PODC): DISC, ICDCN, ICDCS, OPODIS, PPoPP, SIROCCO, SPAA, SSS.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="wattenhofer"&gt;Roger Wattenhofer: [http://dcg.ethz.ch/publications/podc07.pdf PODC 2007 Statistics]. The following conferences are listed as other conferences where PODC authors have published most, during the last 5 years: DISC, OPODIS, SPAA, SIROCCO, ICDCS, SRDS, STOC, SODA, FOCS, ESA.&lt;/ref&gt; or it has received a high ranking&lt;ref name="core"&gt;The [http://www.core.edu.au/rankings/Conference%20Ranking%20Main.html 2007 Australian Ranking of ICT Conferences]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091002002344/http://www.core.edu.au/rankings/Conference%20Ranking%20Main.html |date=2009-10-02 }}. In this ranking, the [http://www.core.edu.au/rankings/conf-tiers.pdf tiers] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080718233742/http://www.core.edu.au/rankings/conf-tiers.pdf |date=2008-07-18 }} are A+ ("... one of the very best in its field or subfield..."), A ("... would add to the author's respect..."), B ("... some confidence that research was done..."), L ("... local conferences..."), and C (the rest). Conferences on the tier A+ include PODC. Conferences on the tier A include the following: CONCUR, DISC, EuroPar, HiPC, HPDC, ICDCS, ICPP, ICS, IPDPS, MassPar, NDSS, PACT, PADS, P2P, PPoPP, PPSN, SPAA, SRDS, SUPER.&lt;/ref&gt;
# the conference focuses on distributed and parallel computing (instead of having a much broader scope such as algorithms in general)
# the conference covers a reasonably large part of the fields of distributed and parallel computing (instead of focusing on a narrow sub-topic).
For the first criterion, references are provided; criteria 2–3 are usually clear from the name of the conference.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="74772">The following is a '''list of people who are considered''' a "'''father'''" '''or''' "'''mother'''" (or "founding father" or "founding mother") '''of a [[Branches of science|scientific field]]'''. Such people are generally regarded to have made the first significant contributions to and/or delineation of that field; they may also be seen as "''a''" rather than "''the''" father or mother of the field. Debate over who merits the title can be perennial. As regards science itself, the title has been bestowed on the ancient Greek philosophers [[Thales]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Singer |first=C. |title=A Short History of Science to the 19th century |location= |publisher=Streeter Press |year=2008 |page=35 |isbn=}}&lt;!--(copied from [[Thales]]--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Needham |first=C.

Even numbers were written out in words rather than symbols! It is quite unlikely that al-Khwarizmi knew of the work of Diophantus, but he must have been familiar with at least the astronomical and computational portions of Brahmagupta; yet neither al-Khwarizmi nor other Arabic scholars made use of syncopation or of negative numbers.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="John Derbyshire For Diophantus"&gt;{{cite book|first=John|last=Derbyshire|authorlink=John Derbyshire|title=Unknown Quantity: A Real And Imaginary History of Algebra|publisher=Joseph Henry Press|year=2006|chapter=The Father of Algebra|pages=31|isbn=0-309-09657-X|quote=Diophantus, the father of algebra, in whose honor I have named this chapter, lived in Alexandria, in Roman Egypt, in either the 1st, the 2nd, or the 3rd century CE.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Then, presumably during the second half of the second century B.C., the first trigonometric table apparently was compiled by the astronomer Hipparchus of Nicaea (ca. 180-ca. 125 B.C.), who thus earned the right to be known as ''the father of trigonometry.'' Aristarchus had known that in a given circle the ratio of arc to chord decreases from 180° to 0°, tending toward a limit of 1. However, it appears that not until Hipparchus undertook the task had anyone tabulated corresponding values of arc and chord for a whole series of angles.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Boyer's opinion may constructively be compared to [[Øystein Ore]]'s opinion, that the Babylonians constructed trigonometric tables ''ca'' 1600 BCE ({{cite book|last=Ore|title=Number Theory and its History|publisher=Dover Publications, Inc.|year=1988|chapter=Diophantine Problems|pages=176–179|isbn=0-486-65620-9|quote=The tablet, catalogued as [[Plimpton 322]], is composed in Old Babylonian script so that it must fall in the period from 1900 B.C. and 1600 B.C., at least a millennium before the Pythagoreans… It is evident, however, that at this early date the Babylonians not only had completely mastered the Pythagorean problem, but also had used it as the basis for the construction of trigonometric tables.}})&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[statistics]] and [[business]], a '''long tail''' of some [[probability distribution|distributions]] of numbers is the portion of the distribution having a large number of occurrences far from the "head" or central part of the distribution. The distribution could involve popularities, random numbers of occurrences of events with various [[probabilities]], etc.&lt;ref&gt;

 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The term is often used loosely, with no definition or arbitrary definition, but precise definitions are possible.

 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Intuitively, a distribution is (right) long-tailed if, for any fixed amount, when a quantity exceeds a high level, it almost certainly exceeds it by at least that amount: large quantities are probably even larger.{{efn|1=Formally, &lt;math&gt;\lim_{x \to \infty} \Pr[X&gt;x+t|X&gt;x] =1,&lt;/math&gt; equivalently &lt;math&gt;\overline{F}(x+t) \sim \overline{F}(x) \quad \mbox{as } x \to \infty.&lt;/math&gt;}} Note that there is no sense of ''the'' "long tail" of a distribution, but only the ''property'' of a distribution being long-tailed.

In business, the term ''long tail'' is applied to [[rank-size distribution]]s or [[rank-frequency distribution]]s (primarily of popularity), which often form [[power law]]s and are thus long-tailed distributions in the statistical sense. This is used to describe the retailing strategy of selling a large number of unique items with relatively small quantities sold of each (the "long tail")—usually in addition to selling fewer popular items in large quantities (the "head"). Sometimes an intermediate category is also included, variously called the ''body'', ''belly'', ''torso'', or ''middle''. The specific cutoff of what part of a distribution is ''the'' "long tail" is often arbitrary, but in some cases may be specified objectively; see [[Rank-size distribution#Segmentation|segmentation of rank-size distributions]].

The long tail concept has found some ground for application, research, and experimentation.  It is a term used in online business, [[mass media]], [[micro-finance]] ([[Grameen Bank]], for example), user-driven innovation ([[Eric von Hippel]]), knowledge management, and social network mechanisms (e.g. [[crowdsourcing]], [[crowdcasting]], [[Peer-to-Peer (meme)|peer-to-peer]]), economic models, marketing ([[viral marketing]]), and IT Security threat hunting within a SOC ([[Information security operations center]]).

==History==
A [[frequency distribution]] with a long tail{{which|date=January 2018}} has been studied by statisticians since at least 1946.&lt;ref&gt;A search for the phrase "long tail" in the database MathSciNet yielded 81 hits, the earliest being a 1946 paper by Brown and Tukey in the Annals of Mathematical Statistics (volume 17, pages 1–12).&lt;/ref&gt; The term has also been used in the finance&lt;ref&gt;Bessis, Jöel "Risk Management in Banking". Wiley, 1995&lt;/ref&gt; and insurance business&lt;ref name="worldwidewords"/&gt; for many years. The work of [[Benoît Mandelbrot]] in the 1950s and later has led to him being referred to as "the father of long tails".&lt;ref&gt;Obrist, Hans Ulrich  [http://www.edge.org/documents/mandelbrot2010/mandelbrot2010_index.html "The Father of Long Tails. An interview with Benoît Mandelbrot"], Edge.org, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

The long tail was popularized by [[Chris Anderson (writer)|Chris Anderson]] in an October 2004 ''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]'' magazine article, in which he mentioned [[Amazon.com]], [[Apple Inc.|Apple]] and [[Yahoo!]] as examples of businesses applying this strategy.&lt;ref name="worldwidewords"&gt;{{cite web|last=Quinion |first=Michael |url=http://www.worldwidewords.org/turnsofphrase/tp-lon1.htm |title=Turns of Phrase: Long Tail |publisher=World Wide Words |date=24 December 2005 |accessdate=25 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Chris Anderson (writer)|Anderson, Chris]]. [https://www.wired.com/wired/archive/12.10/tail.html "The Long Tail"] ''Wired'', October 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; Anderson elaborated the concept in his book ''[[The Long Tail: Why the Future of Business Is Selling Less of More]]''.

==Business==
The distribution and inventory costs of businesses successfully applying a long tail strategy allow them to realize significant profit out of selling small volumes of hard-to-find items to many customers instead of only selling large volumes of a reduced number of popular items. The total sales of this large number of "non-hit items" is called "the long tail".

Given enough choice, a large population of customers, and negligible stocking and distribution costs, the selection and buying pattern of the population results in the demand across products having a [[power law]] distribution or [[Pareto distribution]].
It is important to understand why some distributions are normal vs. long tail (power) distributions. Chris Anderson argues that while quantities such as human height or [[IQ]] follow a normal distribution, in [[scale-free network]]s with [[preferential attachment]]s, power law distributions are created, i.e. because some nodes are more connected than others (like [[Malcolm Gladwell]]’s “mavens” in ''[[The Tipping Point]]'').&lt;ref&gt;Carr, Nichloas  [http://www.roughtype.com/archives/2006/08/the_shape_of_th.php "The shape of the tail."], roughtype.com, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Anderson|first=Chris|title=scifoo: A problem with the Long Tail |year=2006|publisher=Hyperion|location=New York, NY|isbn=1-4013-0237-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Statistical meaning==
[[File:Longtail.svg|frame|right|The tail becomes bigger and longer in new markets (depicted in red). In other words, whereas traditional retailers have focused on the area to the left of the chart, online bookstores derive more sales from the area to the right.]]
''The long tail'' is the name for a long-known feature of some statistical distributions (such as [[Zipf's law|Zipf]], [[power law]]s, [[Pareto distribution]]s and [[Lévy skew alpha-stable distribution|general Lévy distributions]]). In "long-tailed" distributions a high-frequency or high-amplitude population is followed by a low-frequency or low-amplitude population which gradually "tails off" [[asymptotically]].  The events at the far end of the tail have a very low probability of occurrence.

As a [[rule of thumb]], for such population distributions the majority of occurrences (more than half, and where the [[Pareto principle]] applies, 80%) are accounted for by the first 20% of items in the distribution.  What is unusual about a long-tailed distribution is that the most frequently occurring 20% of items represent less than 50% of occurrences; or in other words, the least frequently occurring 80% of items are more important as a proportion of the total population.

[[Power law]] distributions or functions characterize an important number of behaviors from nature and human endeavor.  This fact has given rise to a keen scientific and social interest in such distributions, and the relationships that create them.  The observation of such a distribution often points to specific kinds of mechanisms, and can often indicate a deep connection with other, seemingly unrelated systems.  Examples of behaviors that exhibit long-tailed distribution are the occurrence of certain words in a given language, the income distribution of a business or the intensity of earthquakes (see: [[Gutenberg–Richter law]]).

[[Chris Anderson (writer)|Chris Anderson]]'s and [[Clay Shirky]]'s articles highlight special cases in which we are able to modify the underlying relationships and evaluate the impact on the frequency of events.  In those cases the infrequent, low-amplitude (or low-revenue) events – the long tail, represented here by the portion of the curve to the right of the 20th percentile – can become the largest area under the line.  This suggests that a variation of one mechanism (internet access) or relationship (the cost of storage) can significantly shift the frequency of occurrence of certain events in the distribution.  The shift has a crucial effect in probability and in the customer demographics of businesses like [[mass media]] and online sellers.

However, the long tails characterizing distributions such as the [[Gutenberg–Richter law]] or the words-occurrence [[Zipf's law]], and those highlighted by Anderson and Shirky are of very different, if not opposite, nature: Anderson and Shirky refer to frequency-rank relations, whereas the Gutenberg–Richter law and the Zipf's law are probability distributions. Therefore, in these latter cases "tails" correspond to large-intensity events such as large earthquakes and most popular words, who dominate the distributions. By contrast, the long tails in the frequency-rank plots highlighted by Anderson and Shirky would rather correspond to short tails in the associated probability distributions, and therefore illustrate an opposite phenomenon compared to the Gutenberg–Richter and the Zipf's laws.

==Chris Anderson and Clay Shirky==
Use of the phrase ''the long tail'' in business as "the notion of looking at the tail itself as a new market" of consumers was first coined by [[Chris Anderson (writer)|Chris Anderson]].&lt;ref&gt;See [http://longtail.typepad.com/the_long_tail/2005/05/the_origins_of_.html The origins of "The Long Tail"]&lt;/ref&gt; The concept drew in part from a February 2003 essay by [[Clay Shirky]], "Power Laws, Weblogs and Inequality",&lt;ref name="shirky.com"&gt;[http://www.shirky.com/writings/powerlaw_weblog.html "Power Laws, Weblogs and Inequality"], by Clay Shirky. February 8, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; which noted that a relative handful of [[Blog|weblogs]] have many links going into them but "the long tail" of millions of weblogs may have only a handful of links going into them. Anderson described the effects of the long tail on current and future business models beginning with a series of speeches in early 2004 and with the publication of a ''Wired'' magazine article in October 2004. Anderson later extended it into the book ''[[The Long Tail (book)|The Long Tail: Why the Future of Business is Selling Less of More]]'' (2006).

Anderson argues that products in low demand or that have a low sales volume can collectively make up a market share that rivals or exceeds the relatively few current bestsellers and blockbusters, if the store or distribution channel is large enough. Anderson cites earlier research by [[Erik Brynjolfsson]], [[Yu (Jeffrey) Hu]], and [[Michael D. Smith (economist)|Michael D. Smith]], that showed that a significant portion of Amazon.com's sales come from obscure books that are not available in brick-and-mortar stores. The long tail is a potential market and, as the examples illustrate, the distribution and sales channel opportunities created by the Internet often enable businesses to tap that market successfully.

In his Wired article Anderson opens with an anecdote about creating a niche market for books on Amazon. He writes about a book titled [[Touching the Void (book)|Touching the Void]] about a near-death mountain climbing accident that took place in the Peruvian Andes. Anderson states the book got good reviews, but didn't have much commercial success. However, ten years later a book titled [[Into Thin Air]] by [[Jon Krakauer]] was published and Touching the Void began to sell again. Anderson realized that this was due to Amazon's recommendations. This created a niche market for those who enjoy books about mountain climbing even though it is not considered a popular genre supporting the long tail theory.

An Amazon employee described the long tail as follows: "We sold more books today that didn't sell at all yesterday than we sold today of all the books that did sell yesterday."&lt;ref&gt;[http://longtail.typepad.com/the_long_tail/2005/01/definitions_fin.html#comment-3415583 The Long Tail: Definitions: Final Round!&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;], comment #3 by Josh Petersen.&lt;/ref&gt;

Anderson has explained the term as a reference to the tail of a [[demand curve]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=4156078 |title=The Long Tail |publisher=NPR |date=5 November 2004 |accessdate=25 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term has since been ''re''derived from an XY graph that is created when charting popularity to inventory. In the graph shown above, Amazon's book sales would be represented along the vertical axis, while the book or movie ranks are along the horizontal axis. The total volume of low popularity items exceeds the volume of high popularity items.

==Academic research==

===Effects of online access===
In his [[Wired (magazine)|Wired]] article, [[Chris Anderson (writer)|Chris Anderson]] cites earlier research by [[Erik Brynjolfsson]], [[Yu (Jeffrey) Hu]], and [[Michael D. Smith (economist)|Michael D. Smith]], who first used a log-linear curve on an XY graph to describe the relationship between [[Amazon.com]] sales and sales ranking. They found that a large proportion of [[Amazon.com]]'s book sales come from obscure books that were not available in brick-and-mortar stores.  They then quantified the potential value of the long tail to consumers. In an article published in 2003, these authors showed that, while most of the discussion about the value of the Internet to consumers has revolved around lower prices, consumer benefit (a.k.a. [[consumer surplus]]) from access to increased product variety in online book stores is ten times larger than their benefit from access to lower prices online.  Thus, the primary value of the internet to consumers comes from releasing new sources of value by providing access to products in the long tail.&lt;ref&gt;Brynjolfsson, Erik; Yu (Jeffrey) Hu, and Michael D. Smith, [http://ssrn.com/abstract=400940 "Consumer Surplus in the Digital Economy: Estimating the Value of Increased Product Variety at Online Booksellers"], ''Management Science'', 49 (11), November 2003. [http://ssrn.com/abstract=400940 working paper version, April 2003]&lt;/ref&gt;

===The longer tail over time===
A study by [[Erik Brynjolfsson]], [[Yu (Jeffrey) Hu]], and [[Michael D. Smith (economist)|Michael D. Smith]]&lt;ref&gt;Bynjolfsson, Erik; Yu (Jeffrey) Hu, and Michael D. Smith, 2010, [http://ssrn.com/abstract=1679991 "The Longer Tail: The Changing Shape of Amazon’s Sales Distribution Curve"]&lt;/ref&gt; finds that the long tail has grown longer over time, with niche books accounting for a larger share of total sales. Their analyses suggested that by 2008, niche books accounted for 36.7% of Amazon's sales while the consumer surplus generated by niche books has increased at least fivefold from 2000 to 2008. In addition, their new methodology finds that, while the widely used power laws are a good first approximation for the rank-sales relationship, the slope may not be constant for all book ranks, with the slope becoming progressively steeper for more obscure books.

In support of their findings, Wenqi Zhou and Wenjing Duan not only find a longer tail but also a fatter tail by an in-depth analysis on consumer software downloading pattern in their paper "Online user reviews, product variety, and the long tail"[http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1742519]. The demand for all products decreases, but the decrease for the hits is more pronounced, indicating the demand shifting from the hits to the niches over time. In addition, they also observe a superstar effect in the presence of the long tail. A small number of very popular products still dominates the demand.

===Goodbye Pareto principle, welcome the new distribution===
In a 2006 working paper titled "Goodbye Pareto Principle, Hello Long Tail",&lt;ref&gt;Brynjolfsson, Erik; Yu (Jeffrey) Hu, and Duncan Simester, 2006, [http://ssrn.com/abstract=953587 "Goodbye Pareto Principle, Hello Long Tail: The Effect of Search Costs on the Concentration of Product Sales"]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Erik Brynjolfsson]], [[Yu (Jeffrey) Hu]], and Duncan Simester found that, by greatly lowering [[search engine technology|search]] costs, information technology in general and Internet markets in particular could substantially increase the collective share of hard-to-find products, thereby creating a longer tail in the distribution of sales.

They used a theoretical model to show how a reduction in search costs will affect the concentration in product sales. By analyzing data collected from a multi-channel retailing company, they showed empirical evidence that the Internet channel exhibits a significantly less concentrated sales distribution, when compared with traditional channels. An 80/20 rule fits the distribution of product sales in the catalog channel quite well, but in the Internet channel, this rule needs to be modified to a 72/28 rule in order to fit the distribution of product sales in that channel. The difference in the sales distribution is highly significant, even after controlling for consumer differences.

===Demand-side and supply-side drivers===
The key supply-side factor that determines whether a sales distribution has a long tail is the cost of inventory storage and distribution. Where inventory storage and distribution costs are insignificant, it becomes economically viable to sell relatively unpopular products; however, when storage and distribution costs are high, only the most popular products can be sold. For example, a traditional movie rental store has limited shelf space, which it pays for in the form of building [[Business process overhead|overhead]]; to maximize its profits, it must stock only the most popular movies to ensure that no shelf space is wasted. Because online video rental provider (such as [[Amazon.com]] or [[Netflix]]) stocks movies in centralized warehouses, its storage costs are far lower and its distribution costs are the same for a popular or unpopular movie. It is therefore able to build a viable business stocking a far wider range of movies than a traditional movie rental store. Those economics of storage and distribution then enable the advantageous use of the long tail: for example, Netflix finds that in aggregate, "unpopular" movies are rented more than popular movies.

An ''[[MIT Sloan Management Review]]'' article titled "From Niches to Riches: Anatomy of the Long Tail"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=Erik |last=Brynjolfsson |first2=Yu Jeffrey |last2=Hu |first3=Michael D. |last3=Smith |ssrn=918142 |title=From Niches to Riches: Anatomy of the Long Tail |publisher=Sloan Management Review |date=Summer 2006 |volume=47 |pages=67–71 |accessdate=|issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; examined the long tail from both the supply side and the demand side and identifies several key drivers. On the supply side, the authors point out how [[e-tailer]]s' expanded, centralized warehousing allows for more offerings, thus making it possible for them to cater to more varied tastes.&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, Chirs. [https://www.wired.com/wired/archive/14.07/longtail_pr.html The Rise and Fall of the Hit]. ''Wired''.&lt;/ref&gt;

On the demand side, tools such as search engines, recommendation software, and sampling tools are allowing customers to find products outside their geographic area. The authors also look toward the future to discuss second-order, amplified effects of Long Tail, including the growth of markets serving smaller niches.

Not all recommender systems are equal, however, when it comes to expanding the long tail. Some recommenders (i.e. certain collaborative filters) can exhibit a bias toward popular products, creating [[positive feedback]], and actually reduce the long tail. A [[Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania|Wharton]] study details this phenomenon along with several ideas that may promote the long tail and greater diversity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last1= Fleder | first1= Daniel | first2= Kartik |last2= Hosanagar | title=Blockbuster Culture's Next Rise or Fall: The Impact of Recommender Systems on Sales Diversity|journal=Management Science |date=May 2009|ssrn=955984 | doi = 10.1287/mnsc.1080.0974 | volume=55 | pages=697–712}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A recent study conducted by Wenqi Zhou and Wenjing Duan&lt;ref&gt;Zhou, W., and Duan, W. Online user reviews, product variety and the long tail: An empirical investigation on online software downloads. Electron. Comm. Res. Appl. (2011) [http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1742519 available at SSRN]&lt;/ref&gt; further points out that the demand side factor (online user reviews) and the supply side factor (product variety) interplay to influence the long tail formation of user choices. Consumers' reliance on online user reviews to choose products is significantly influenced by the quantity of products available. Specifically, they find that the impacts of both positive and negative user reviews are weakened as product variety goes up. In addition, the increase in product variety reduces the impact of user reviews on popular products more than it does on niche products.

===Networks, crowds, and the long tail===
The "crowds" of customers, users and small companies that inhabit the long-tail distribution can perform collaborative and assignment work.  Some relevant forms of these new production models are:
* The [[Peer-to-peer (meme)|peer-to-peer]] collaboration groups that produce open-source software or create [[wiki]]s such as [[Wikipedia]].
* The [[crowdsourcing]] model, in which a company outsources work to a large group of market players using a collaborative online platform.
* The model of [[crowdcasting]], is the process of building a network of users and then delivering challenges or tasks to be solved with the purpose of gaining insights or innovative ideas.
* Work performed by individuals in commons-like, non-market networks, described in the work of [[Yochai Benkler]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.benkler.org/ |title=Benkler, The Wealth of Networks |publisher=Benkler.org |date= |accessdate=25 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The demand-side factors that lead to the long tail can be amplified by the "networks of products" which are created by hyperlinked recommendations across products. An [[MIS Quarterly]] article by Gal Oestreicher-Singer and [[Arun Sundararajan]] shows that categories of books on [[Amazon.com]] which are more central and thus influenced more by their recommendation network have significantly more pronounced long-tail distributions. Their data across 200 subject areas shows that a doubling of this influence leads to a 50% increase in revenues from the least popular one-fifth of books.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

===Turnover within the long tail===
The long-tail distribution applies at a given point in time, but over time the relative popularity of the sales of the individual products will change.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1016/j.evolhumbehav.2006.10.002 | volume=28 | title=Regular rates of popular culture change reflect random copying | year=2007 | journal=Evolution and Human Behavior | pages=151–158 | last1 = Bentley | first1 = R. Alexander | last2 = Lipo | first2 = Carl P. | last3 = Herzog | first3 = Harold A. | last4 = Hahn | first4 = Matthew W.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Although the distribution of sales may appear to be similar over time, the positions of the individual items within it will vary. For example, new items constantly enter most fashion markets. A recent fashion-based model &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/connected/main.jhtml?xml=/connected/2004/06/16/ecfpop16.xml&amp;sSheet=/connected/2004/06/14/ixconn.html |title=Why are they so popular? |first=Roger |last=Highfield |publisher=The Daily Telegraph |date=16 June 2004 |accessdate=25 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; of consumer choice, which is capable of generating power law distributions of sales similar to those observed in practice,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bentley | first1 = R.A. | last2 = Hahn | first2 = M.W. | last3 = Shennan | first3 = S.J. | year = 2007 | title = Random drift and culture change | url = http://journals.royalsociety.org/content/1n1x17lp0c0q65uj | journal = Proceedings of the Royal Society | volume = 271 | issue = | pages = 1443–50 }}&lt;/ref&gt; takes into account turnover in the relative sales of a given set of items, as well as innovation, in the sense that entirely new items become offered for sale.

There may be an optimal inventory size, given the balance between sales and the cost of keeping up with the turnover.  An analysis based on this pure fashion model&lt;ref&gt;[https://arxiv.org/abs/0808.1655 "Shelf space strategy in long tail markets"] by R.A. Bentley, P. Ormerod and M.E. Madsen, arXive&lt;/ref&gt; indicates that, even for digital retailers, the optimal inventory may in many cases be less than the millions of items that they can potentially offer. In other words, by proceeding further and further into the long tail, sales may become so small that the marginal cost of tracking them in rank order, even at a digital scale, might be optimised well before a million titles, and certainly before infinite titles.  This model can provide further predictions into markets with long-tail distribution, such as the basis for a model for optimizing the number of each individual item ordered, given its current sales rank and the total number of different titles stocked.

==Business models==

===Competitive impact===
Before a long tail works, only the most popular products are generally offered.  When the cost of inventory storage and distribution fall, a wide range of products become available. This can, in turn, have the effect of reducing demand for the most popular products. For example,  a small website that focuses on niches of content can be threatened by a larger website which has a variety of information (such as Yahoo) [[Web content]]. The big website covers more variety while the small website has only a few niches to choose from.

The competitive threat from these niche sites is reduced by the cost of establishing and maintaining them and the effort required for readers to track multiple small web sites. These factors have been transformed by easy and cheap web site software and the spread of [[RSS]]. Similarly, mass-market distributors like [[Blockbuster Inc.|Blockbuster]] may be threatened by distributors like [[LoveFilm]], which supply the titles that Blockbuster doesn't offer because they are not already very popular.

===Internet companies===
Some of the most successful Internet businesses have used the long tail as part of their business strategy.  Examples include [[eBay]] (auctions), [[Yahoo!]] and [[Google]] (web search), [[Amazon.com|Amazon]] (retail), and [[iTunes Store]] (music and [[podcast]]s), amongst the major companies, along with smaller Internet companies like [[Audible.com|Audible]] (audio books) and [[LoveFilm]] (video rental). These purely digital retailers also have almost no marginal cost, which is benefiting the online services, unlike physical retailers that have fixed limits on their products. The internet can still sell physical goods, but at an unlimited selection and with reviews and recommendations.&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, Chris (December 13, 2004)"The Long Tail" issue 10.01.&lt;/ref&gt; The internet has opened up larger territories to sell and provide its products without being confined to just the "local Markets" such as physical retailers like [[Target Corporation|Target]] or even [[Walmart]]. With the digital and hybrid retailers there is no longer a perimeter on market demands.&lt;ref&gt;McDonald, Scott. "Journal of Advertising Research" (Sep 2008) Vol. 48 Issue 3, pp 313–319, 7 p, 2 graphs&lt;/ref&gt;

===Video and multiplayer online games===
The adoption of [[video game]]s and [[massively multiplayer online game]]s such as [[Second Life]] as tools for education and training is starting to show a long-tailed pattern. It costs significantly less to modify a game than it has been to create unique training applications, such as those for training in business, commercial flight, and military missions. This has led some{{Who|date=May 2013}} to envision a time in which game-based training devices or simulations will be available for thousands of different job descriptions. {{Citation needed|date=May 2013}}

===Microfinance and microcredit===
The banking business has used internet technology to reach an increasing number of customers.  The most important shift in business model due to the long tail has come from the various forms of [[microfinance]] developed.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}

As opposed to e-tailers, micro-finance is a distinctly low technology business.  Its aim is to offer very small credits to lower-middle to lower class and poor people, that would otherwise be ignored by the traditional banking business.  The banks that have followed this strategy of selling services to the low-frequency long tail of the sector have found out that it can be an important niche, long ignored by consumer banks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gdrc.org/icm/ |title=Microcredit and Microfinance |publisher=The Global Development Research Center |date= |accessdate=25 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The recipients of small credits tend to be very good payers of loans, despite their non-existent credit history.  They are also willing to pay higher interest rates than the standard bank or credit card customer. It also is a business model that fills an important developmental role in an economy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.uncdf.org/english/microfinance/ |title=Vision and Mission Statement for Building Inclusive Financial Sectors |publisher=United Nations Capital Development Fund |date= |accessdate=25 December 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111231215224/http://www.uncdf.org/english/microfinance/ |archivedate=31 December 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Grameen Bank]] in [[Bangladesh]] has successfully followed this business model.  In Mexico the banks Compartamos and [[Banco Azteca]] also service this customer demographic, with an emphasis on consumer credit. [[Kiva.org]] is an organization that provides micro credits to people worldwide, by using intermediaries called small microfinance organizations (S.M.O.'s)to distribute crowd sourced donations made by Kiva.org lenders.

===User-driven innovation===
According to the [[User innovation|user-driven innovation]] model, companies can rely on users of their products and services to do a significant part of the [[innovation]] work.  Users want products that are customized to their needs.  They are willing to tell the manufacturer what they really want and how it should work.  Companies can make use of a series of tools, such as interactive and internet based technologies, to give their users a voice and to enable them to do innovation work that is useful to the company.

Given the diminishing cost of communication and information sharing (by analogy to the low cost of storage and distribution, in the case of [[e-tailers]]), long-tailed user driven innovation will gain importance for businesses.

In following a long-tailed innovation strategy, the company is using the model to tap into a large group of users that are in the low-intensity area of the distribution.  It is their [[collaboration]] and aggregated work that results in an innovation effort. [[Social innovation]] communities formed by groups of users can perform rapidly the [[trial and error]] process of innovation, share information, test and diffuse the results.

[[Eric von Hippel]] of MIT's Sloan School of Management defined the user-led innovation model in his book ''Democratizing Innovation''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.mit.edu/evhippel/www/democ1.htm |title=Democratizing Innovation |publisher=MIT Press |date= |accessdate=25 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among his conclusions is the insight that as innovation becomes more user-centered the information needs to flow freely, in a more democratic way, creating a "rich intellectual commons" and "attacking a major structure of the social division of labor".

===Marketing===
The drive to build a market and obtain revenue from the consumer demographic of the long tail has led businesses to implement a series of long-tail [[marketing]] techniques, most of them based on extensive use of internet technologies. Among the most representative are:
* [[New media marketing]]: The building and managing of [[social networks]] and online or [[virtual communities]] to extend the reach of marketing to the low-frequency, low-intensity consumer in a cost-effective way, often through [[blog]]s, [[RSS|RSS feeds]] and [[podcast]]s.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}
* Buzz marketing:  The strategic use of [[word of mouth]] and transmission of commercial information from person to person in an online or real-world environment.
* [[Viral marketing]]: The intentional spreading of marketing messages using preexisting social networks, with an emphasis on the casual, non-intentional and low cost, commonly through [[YouTube]] videos, [[viral email]]s and standalone [[microsite]]s.
* [[Pay per click]] and [[search engine optimization]]: The marketing of websites on search engines such as [[Google]], [[Yahoo! Search|Yahoo]] and [[Bing (search engine)|Bing]] by focusing on long-tail keywords which have less competition.
* [[Demand-side platform]]s/DSPs: Similar to how [[search engine marketing]] monetizes the long tail of keywords, auction-oriented buying/selling mechanisms are also viable to help monetize the long tail of ad impressions available across niche publishers in the [[display advertising]] realm. Publishers utilize these [[ad exchange]] environments, such as [[Right Media]] or [[AdECN]], to efficiently sell display inventory that might otherwise go unsold through direct sales force operations. As a result, by January 2011 between 20–25% of all US ad spending was derived from long tail advertisers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mediapost.com/publications/article/142294/long-tail-advertisers-are-back-us-ad-expansio.html |title='Long Tail' Advertisers Are Back, U.S. Ad Expansion Reaches '03 Levels |publisher=MediaDailyNews |date=2011-01-04 |accessdate=2014-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cultural and political impact==
{{Original research|section|date=May 2015}}
The long tail has possible implications for [[culture]] and [[politics]]. Where the [[opportunity cost]] of inventory storage and distribution is high, only the most popular products are sold.  But where the long tail works, minority tastes become available and individuals are presented with a wider array of choices.  The long tail presents opportunities for various suppliers to introduce products in the niche category.  These encourage the diversification of products.  These niche products open opportunities for suppliers while concomitantly satisfying the demands of many individuals – therefore lengthening the tail portion of the long tail.  In situations where popularity is currently determined by the lowest common denominator, a long-tail model may lead to improvement in a society's level of culture.  The opportunities that arise because of the long tail greatly affect society's cultures because suppliers have unlimited capabilities due to infinite storage and demands that were unable to be met prior to the long tail are realized. At the end of the long tail, the conventional profit-making business model ceases to exist; instead, people tend to come up with products for varied reasons like expression rather than monetary benefit. In this way, the long tail opens up a large space for authentic works of creativity.

===Cultural diversity===
[[Television]] is a good example of this: Chris Anderson defines long-tail TV in the context of "content that is not available through traditional distribution channels but could nevertheless find an audience."&lt;ref&gt;Chris Anderson. [http://www.longtail.com/the_long_tail/2005/01/long_tail_tv_pa_2.html The Long Tail TV: Conclusion]. ''The Long Tail Blog''. January 17, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the advent of services such as [[television on demand]], [[pay-per-view]] and even premium cable subscription services such as HBO and Showtime open up the opportunity for niche content to reach the right audiences, in an otherwise mass medium.  These may not always attract the highest level of viewership, but their business distribution models make that of less importance. As the opportunity cost goes down, the choice of TV programs grows and greater cultural diversity rises.

===Distribution of independent content===
Often presented as a phenomenon of interest primarily to mass market retailers and web-based businesses, the long tail also has implications for the producers of content, especially those whose products could not – for economic reasons – find a place in pre-Internet information distribution channels controlled by book publishers, record companies, movie studios, and television networks. Looked at from the producers' side, the long tail has made possible a flowering of creativity across all fields of human endeavour.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}} One example of this is [[YouTube]], where thousands of diverse videos – whose content, production value or lack of popularity make them inappropriate for traditional television – are easily accessible to a wide range of viewers.

===Contemporary literature===
The intersection of viral marketing, online communities and new technologies that operate within the long tail of consumers and business is described in the novel by [[William Gibson]], ''[[Pattern Recognition (novel)|Pattern Recognition]]''.

===Military applications and security===
In military thinking, [[John Robb (GG theorist)|John Robb]] applies the long tail to the developments in insurgency and terrorist movements, showing how technology and networking allows the long tail of disgruntled groups and criminals to take on the nation state and have a chance to win.

==Criticisms==
A 2008 study by [[Anita Elberse]], professor of business administration at [[Harvard Business School]], calls the long tail theory into question, citing sales data which shows that the Web magnifies the importance of blockbuster hits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Elberse|first=Anita|title=Should You Invest in the Long Tail?|url=http://hbr.org/2008/07/should-you-invest-in-the-long-tail/ar/1|publisher=Harvard Business Review|date=July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; On his blog, Chris Anderson responded to the study, praising Elberse and the academic rigor with which she explores the issue but drawing a distinction between their respective interpretations of where the "head" and "tail" begin. Elberse defined head and tail using percentages, while Anderson uses absolute numbers.&lt;ref name="andersonblog-elberse"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.longtail.com/the_long_tail/2008/06/excellent-hbr-p.html|author=Anderson, Chris|publisher=The Long Tail Blog|title=Excellent HBR piece challenging the Long Tail|date=27 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Similar results were published by [[Serguei Netessine]] and Tom F. Tan, who suggest that head and tail should be defined by percentages rather than absolute numbers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu/article.cfm?articleid=2338|title=Rethinking the Long Tail Theory: How to Define 'Hits' and 'Niches'|publisher=Knowledge@Wharton|date=16 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in 2008, a sales analysis of an unnamed UK digital music service by economist [[Will Page]] and high-tech entrepreneur Andrew Bud found that sales exhibited a [[log-normal distribution]] rather than a power law; they reported that 80% of the music tracks available sold no copies at all over a one-year period. Anderson responded by stating that the study's findings are difficult to assess without access to its data.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Anderson|first=Chris|title=More Long Tail debate: mobile music no, search yes|url=http://www.longtail.com/the_long_tail/2008/11/more-long-tail.html|publisher=The Long Tail|accessdate=25 December 2011|date=8 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Foster|first=Patrick|title=Long Tail theory contradicted as study reveals 10m digital music tracks unsold|url=http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/arts/music/article2416859.ece|publisher=Times Online|date=22 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Military education and training''' is a process which intends to establish and improve the capabilities of [[armed forces|military personnel]] in their respective roles. It begins with [[recruit training]], proceeds to education and training specific to military roles, and may also include additional training during a military career. Military training may be voluntary or compulsory duty. 

== Recruit training ==
{{Main|Recruit training}}

The primary form of military training is [[recruit training]], which makes use of various conditioning techniques to [[Resocialization|resocialize]] trainees into the military system, ensure that they will obey all orders without hesitation, and teach basic military skills.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.defence.gov.au/publications/docs/LCIreport.pdf|title=Final report of the Learning Culture Inquiry|last=Australia, Department of Defence|first=|date=2006|website=|access-date=2017-07-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Winslow|first=Donna|date=2004|title=Misplaced Loyalties: The Role of Military Culture in the Breakdown of Discipline in Two Peace Operations|url=http://jmss.org/jmss/index.php/jmss/article/view/214|journal=Journal of Military and Strategic Studies|language=en|volume=6|issue=3|issn=1488-559X}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title='Joining the ranks: The role of indoctrination in transforming civilians to service members', (in 'Military life: The psychology of serving in peace and combat [vol. 2]')|last=McGurk et al.|first=|publisher=Praeger Security International|year=2006|isbn=978-0275983024|location=Westport|pages=13–31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/427757599|title=On killing : the psychological cost of learning to kill in war and society|last=Dave.|first=Grossman,|date=2009|publisher=Little, Brown and Co|isbn=9780316040938|edition=Rev.|location=New York|oclc=427757599}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/25283124|title=Squaddies : portrait of a subculture|last=John.|first=Hockey,|date=1986|publisher=University of Exeter|isbn=9780859892483|location=Exeter, Devon|oclc=25283124}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[drill instructor]] has the task of making the service members fit for military use. [[Resocialization|(Resocialization]] is a [[Sociology|sociological]] concept referring to the process of mentally and emotionally "re-training" a person so they can operate in a new environment, and involves changes to an individual's attitudes and behaviours.)  

== Role-specific training ==
After their [[recruit training]], personnel may undergo further training specific to their military role, including the use of any specialist equipment. After this point, they are normally deemed fit for military service.

== Further training ==
Military personnel may continue to receive training during their career.

== Military academies ==
Larger countries may have [[Military academy|military academies]], which combine military training with formal qualifications.

'''''Nationalnyckeln till Sveriges flora och fauna''''' ([[Swedish language|Swedish]] for "National Key to Sweden's Flora and Fauna") is a set of [[book]]s, the first volume of which, ''Fjärilar: Dagfjärilar'' ([[Butterfly|Butterflies]], 140 species), appeared on 25 April 2005.&lt;ref name=ne /&gt; The publishing plan comprises 100,000 illustrations spread over more than 100 volumes, to appear over a period of 20 years, listing and providing [[popular science|popular scientific]] descriptions of all [[species]] of plants ([[flora (plants)|flora]]) and animals ([[fauna (animals)|fauna]]) in [[Sweden]]. So large a work has never been published in the history of [[Swedish literature]].

''Nationalnyckeln'' is a popular scientific account produced on contract from the [[Riksdag]] by the  [[Swedish Species Information Centre]] (ArtDatabanken) at the [[Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences]] (SLU) in [[Uppsala]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="77194">'''Participatory action research''' ('''PAR''') is an approach to research in communities that emphasizes participation and action.  It seeks to understand the world by trying to change it, collaboratively and following reflection. PAR emphasizes collective inquiry and experimentation grounded in experience and social history. Within a PAR process, "communities of inquiry and action evolve and address questions and issues that are significant for those who participate as co-researchers".&lt;ref name="ReasonBradbury2008"/&gt; PAR contrasts with many research methods, which emphasize disinterested researchers and [[reproducibility]] of findings. {{Citation needed|reason=Emphasize disinterested researchers does not seem to be correct|date=August 2017}}

PAR practitioners make a concerted effort to integrate three basic aspects of their work: participation (life in society and democracy), action (engagement with experience and history), and research (soundness in thought and the growth of knowledge).&lt;ref name="ChevalierBuckles2013"/&gt; "Action unites, organically, with research" and collective processes of self-investigation.&lt;ref name="Rahman2008"/&gt; The way each component is actually understood and the relative emphasis it receives varies nonetheless from one PAR theory and practice to another. This means that PAR is not a monolithic body of ideas and methods but rather a pluralistic orientation to knowledge making and social change.&lt;ref name="Chambers2008"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Allen2001"/&gt;&lt;ref name="CamicJoas2003"/&gt;

}}

==Overview==
PAR has multiple progenitors and resists definition.  It is a broad tradition of collective [[self-experimentation]] backed up by evidential reasoning, fact-finding and learning. All formulations of PAR have in common the idea that research and action must be done 'with' people and not 'on' or 'for' people.&lt;ref name="ReasonBradbury2008"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ChevalierBuckles2013"/&gt;&lt;ref name="BrockPettit2007"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ChevalierBuckles2008"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Heron1995"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kindon2007"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Reason1995"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Swantz2008"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Whyte1991"/&gt; It counters [[scientism]] by promoting the grounding of knowledge in human agency and social history (as in much of political economy). Inquiry based on PAR principles makes sense of the world through collective efforts to transform it, as opposed to simply observing and studying human behaviour and people's views about reality, in the hope that meaningful change will eventually emerge.

PAR draws on a wide range of influences, both among those with professional training and those who draw on their life experience and those of their ancestors. Many draw on the work of [[Paulo Freire]],&lt;ref name="Freire1982"/&gt; new thinking on adult education research,&lt;ref name="Hall1975"/&gt; the [[Civil Rights Movement]],&lt;ref name="HortonFreire1990"/&gt; South Asian social movements such as the Bhoomi Sena,&lt;ref name="Rahman2008"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Rahman2011"/&gt; and key initiatives such as the Participatory Research Network created in 1978 and based in New Delhi. "It has benefited from an interdisciplinary development drawing its theoretical strength from adult education,
sociology, political economy, community psychology, community development, feminist studies, critical psychology, organizational development and more".&lt;ref name="Hall1992"/&gt; The Colombian sociologist [[Orlando Fals Borda]] and others organized the first explicitly PAR conference in Cartagena, Colombia in 1977.&lt;ref name="Hall2005"/&gt; Based on his research with peasant groups in rural Boyaca and with other underserved groups, Fals Borda called for the 'community action' component to be incorporated into the research plans of traditionally trained researchers. His recommendations to researchers committed to the struggle for justice and greater democracy in all spheres, including the business of science, are useful for all researchers and echo the teaching from many schools of research:

: "Do not monopolise your knowledge nor impose arrogantly your techniques, but respect and combine your skills with the knowledge of the researched or grassroots communities, taking them as full partners and co-researchers. Do not trust elitist versions of history and science which respond to dominant interests, but be receptive to counter-narratives and try to recapture them. Do not depend solely on your culture to interpret facts, but recover local values, traits, beliefs, and arts for action by and with the research organisations. Do not impose your own ponderous scientific style for communicating results, but diffuse and share what you have learned together with the people, in a manner that is wholly understandable and even literary and pleasant, for science should not be necessarily a mystery nor a monopoly of experts and intellectuals."&lt;ref name="FalsBorda1995"/&gt;

In the UK and North America the work of [[Kurt Lewin]]&lt;ref name="Lewin1946"/&gt; and the [[Tavistock Institute]] in the 1940s has been influential. However alternative traditions of PAR, begin with processes that include more bottom-up organising and popular education than were envisaged by Lewin.

PAR strategies to democratize knowledge making and ground it in real community needs and learning {{Clarify|post-text=What are these strategies?|date=May 2014}} represent genuine efforts to overcome the ineffectiveness and elitism of conventional schooling and science, and the negative effects of market forces and industry on the workplace, community life and sustainable livelihoods. These principles and the ongoing evolution of PAR have had a lasting legacy in fields ranging from problem solving in the workplace to community development and sustainable livelihoods, education, public health, feminist research and civic engagement. It is important to note that these contributions are subject to many tensions and debates on key issues such as the role of ''clinical psychology'', ''critical social thinking'' and the pragmatic concerns of ''organizational learning'' in PAR theory and practice. Labels used to define each approach (PAR, critical PAR, action research, psychosociology, sociotechnical analysis, etc.) reflect these tensions and point to major differences that may outweigh the similarities. While a common denominator, the combination of participation, action and research reflects the fragile unity of traditions whose diverse ideological and organizational contexts kept them separate and largely ignorant of one another for several decades.&lt;ref name="BrownTandon1983"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Brown1993"/&gt;

The following review focuses on traditions that incorporate the three pillars of PAR. Closely related approaches that overlap but do not bring the three components together are left out. [[Applied research]], for instance, is not necessarily committed to participatory principles and may be initiated and controlled mostly by experts, with the implication that 'human subjects' are not invited to play a key role in science building and the framing of the research questions. As in mainstream science, this process "regards people as sources of information, as having bits of isolated knowledge, but they are neither expected nor apparently assumed able to analyze a given social reality".&lt;ref name="Hall1975"/&gt; PAR also differs from participatory inquiry or collaborative research, contributions to knowledge that may not involve direct engagement with transformative action and social history. PAR, in contrast, has evolved from the work of activists more concerned with empowering marginalized peoples than with generating academic knowledge for its own sake.&lt;ref name="Freire1970"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hall1981"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Tandon2002"/&gt; Lastly, given its commitment to the research process, PAR overlaps but is not synonymous with [[Action learning]], [[Action Reflection Learning]] (ARL), [[participatory development]] and [[community development]]—recognized forms of problem solving and capacity building that may be carried out with no immediate concern for research and the advancement of knowledge.&lt;ref name="BartunekSchein2011"/&gt;

===Organizational life===
[[Action research]] in the workplace took its initial inspiration from Lewin's work on organizational development (and [[John Dewey|Dewey]]'s emphasis on learning from experience). Lewin's seminal contribution involves a flexible, scientific approach to planned change that proceeds through a spiral of steps, each of which is composed of 'a circle of planning, action, and fact-finding about the result of the action', towards an organizational 'climate' of democratic leadership and responsible participation that promotes critical self-inquiry and collaborative work.&lt;ref name="Lewin1948"/&gt; These steps inform Lewin's work with basic skill training groups, [[T-groups]] where community leaders and group facilitators use feedback, problem solving, role play and cognitive aids (lectures, handouts, film) to gain insights into themselves, others and groups with a view to 'unfreezing' and changing their mindsets, attitudes and behaviours.
Lewin's understanding of action-research coincides with key ideas and practices developed at the influential [[Tavistock Institute]] (created in 1947)) in the UK and National Training Laboratories (NTL) in the US. An important offshoot of Tavistock thinking and practise is the [[sociotechnical systems]] perspective on workplace dynamics, guided by the idea that greater productivity or efficiency does not hinge on improved technology alone. Improvements in organizational life call instead for the interaction and 'joint optimization' of the social and technical components of workplace activity. In this perspective, the best match between the social and technical factors of organized work lies in principles of 'responsible group autonomy' and [[industrial democracy]], as opposed to deskilling and top-down bureaucracy guided by [[Frederick Winslow Taylor|Taylor]]'s scientific management and linear chain of command.&lt;ref name="Ackoff1999"/&gt;&lt;ref name="CrézéLiu2006"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Crozier2000"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Greenwood1991"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Liu1997"/&gt;&lt;ref name="TristBamforth1951"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Rice2003"/&gt;

NTL played a central role in the evolution of experiential learning and the application of behavioral science to improving organizations. Process consultation, team building, conflict management, and workplace group democracy and autonomy have become recurrent themes in the prolific body of literature and practice known as [[organizational development]] (OD).&lt;ref name="FriedlanderBrown1974"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Cummings2008"/&gt; As with 'action science',&lt;ref name="Argyris1985"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ArgyrisSchön1989"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Argyris1993"/&gt;&lt;ref name="DickDalmau1991"/&gt; OD is a response to calls for planned change and 'rational social management' involving a normative [[human relations movement]] and approach to worklife in capital-dominated economies.&lt;ref name="Dubost1987pp84–88"/&gt; Its principal goal is to enhance an organization's performance and the worklife experience, with the assistance of a consultant, a change agent or catalyst that helps the sponsoring organization define and solve its own problems, introduce new forms of leadership&lt;ref name="Torbert2004"/&gt; and change organizational culture and learning.&lt;ref name="CameronQuinn2011"/&gt;&lt;ref name="SengeScharmer2001"/&gt; Diagnostic and capacity-building activities are informed, to varying degrees, by psychology, the behavioural sciences, organizational studies, or theories of leadership and social innovation.&lt;ref name="Ospina2008"/&gt;&lt;ref name="MesnierVandernotte2012"/&gt; [[Appreciative Inquiry]] (AI), for instance, is an offshoot of PAR based on [[positive psychology]].&lt;ref name="Seligman2002"/&gt; Rigorous data gathering or fact-finding methods may be used to support the inquiry process and group thinking and planning. On the whole, however, science tends to be a means, not an end. Workplace and organizational learning interventions are first and foremost problem-based, action-oriented and client-centred.

===Psychosociology===
Tavistock broke new ground in other ways as well, by meshing general medicine and psychiatry with Freudian and Jungian psychology and the social sciences to help the British army face various human resource problems. This gave rise to a field of scholarly research and professional intervention loosely known as psychosociology, particularly influential in France (CIRFIP). Several schools of thought and 'social clinical' practise belong to this tradition, all of which are critical of the experimental and expert mindset of [[social psychology]].&lt;ref name="Dubost1987pp287–291"/&gt; Most formulations of psychosociology share with OD a commitment to the relative autonomy and active participation of individuals and groups coping with problems of self-realization and goal effectiveness within larger organizations and institutions. In addition to this humanistic and democratic agenda, psychosociology uses concepts of [[psychoanalysis|psychoanalytic]] inspiration to address interpersonal relations and the interplay between self and group. It acknowledges the role of the unconscious in social behaviour and collective representations and the inevitable expression of [[transference]] and [[countertransference]]—language and behaviour that redirect unspoken feelings and anxieties to other people or physical objects taking part in the action inquiry.&lt;ref name="ChevalierBuckles2013"/&gt;

The works of Balint,&lt;ref name="Balint1954"/&gt; [[Elliott Jaques|Jaques]],&lt;ref name="Jaques1951"/&gt;) and [[Wilfred Bion|Bion]]&lt;ref name="Bion1961"/&gt; are turning points in the formative years of psychosociology. Commonly cited authors in France include Amado,&lt;ref name="Amado1993"/&gt; Barus-Michel,&lt;ref name="Barus-Michel1987"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Barus-Michel2006"/&gt; Dubost,&lt;ref name="Dubost1987"/&gt; Enriquez,&lt;ref name="Enriquez1992"/&gt; Lévy,&lt;ref name="Lévy2001"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Lévy2010"/&gt; Gaujelac,&lt;ref name="Gaujelac1997"/&gt; and Giust-Desprairies.&lt;ref name="Giust-Desprairies1989"/&gt; Different schools of thought and practice include Mendel's action research framed in a 'sociopsychoanalytic' perspective&lt;ref name="Mendel1980"/&gt;&lt;ref name="MendelPrades2002"/&gt; and Dejours's psychodynamics of work, with its emphasis on work-induced suffering and defence mechanisms.&lt;ref name="Dejours1988"/&gt; Lapassade and Lourau's 'socianalytic' interventions focus rather on institutions viewed as systems that dismantle and recompose norms and rules of social interaction over time, a perspective that builds on the principles of institutional analysis and psychotherapy.&lt;ref name="LapassadeLourau1971"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Lourau1970"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Lourau1996"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Tosquelles1984"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Tosquelles1992"/&gt; [[:fr:Didier Anzieu|Anzieu]] and Martin's&lt;ref name="AnzieuMartin1966"/&gt; work on group psychoanalysis and theory of the collective 'skin-ego' is generally considered as the most faithful to the Freudian tradition. Key differences between these schools and the methods they use stem from the weight they assign to the analyst's expertise in making sense of group behaviour and views and also the social aspects of group behaviour and affect. Another issue is the extent to which the intervention is critical of broader institutional and social systems. The use of psychoanalytic concepts and the relative weight of effort dedicated to research, training and action also vary.&lt;ref name="ChevalierBuckles2013"/&gt;

===Community development and sustainable livelihoods===
PAR emerged in the postwar years as an important contribution to intervention and self-transformation within groups, organizations and communities. It has left a singular mark on the field of rural and community development, especially in the Global South. Tools and concepts for doing research with people, including "barefoot scientists" and grassroots "organic intellectuals" (see [[Gramsci]]), are now promoted and implemented by many international development agencies, researchers, consultants, civil society and local community organizations around the world. This has resulted in countless experiments in diagnostic assessment, scenario planning&lt;ref name="Ogilvy2002"/&gt; and project evaluation in areas ranging from fisheries&lt;ref name="IIRR1998"/&gt; and mining&lt;ref name="Coumans2009"/&gt; to forestry,&lt;ref name="Case1990"/&gt; plant breeding,&lt;ref name="Vernooy2003"/&gt; agriculture,&lt;ref name="Gonsalves2005"/&gt; farming systems research and extension,&lt;ref name="BrockPettit2007"/&gt;&lt;ref name="BraunHocdé2000"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Collinson2000"/&gt; watershed management,&lt;ref name="Hinchcliffe1999"/&gt; resource mapping,&lt;ref name="Kindon2007"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Fox2005"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kesby2007"/&gt; environmental conflict and natural resource management,&lt;ref name="ChevalierBuckles2013"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Means2002"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Park1993"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Pound2003"/&gt; land rights,&lt;ref name="BucklesKhedkar2012"/&gt; appropriate technology,&lt;ref name="Bentley1994"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Gupta2006"/&gt; local economic development,&lt;ref name="LewisGaventa1988"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Selener1997"/&gt; communication,&lt;ref name="Bessette2004"/&gt;&lt;ref name="QuarryRamirez2009"/&gt; tourism,&lt;ref name="Blangy2010"/&gt; leadership for sustainability,&lt;ref name="Marshall2011"/&gt; biodiversity&lt;ref name="Mazhar2007"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Pimbert2011"/&gt; and climate change.&lt;ref name="LealFilho2011"/&gt; This prolific literature includes the many insights and methodological creativity of [[participatory monitoring]], [[participatory rural appraisal]] (PRA) and participatory learning and action (PLA)&lt;ref name="Chambers1983"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Chambers1994"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Pretty1995"/&gt; and all action-oriented studies of local, indigenous or [[traditional knowledge]].&lt;ref name="Warren1995"/&gt;

On the whole, PAR applications in these fields are committed to problem solving and adaptation to nature at the household or community level, using friendly methods of scientific thinking and experimentation adapted to support rural participation and sustainable livelihoods.

===Literacy, education and youth===
In education, PAR practitioners inspired by the ideas of [[critical pedagogy]] and [[adult education]] are firmly committed to the politics of emancipatory action formulated by [[Paulo Freire|Freire]],&lt;ref name="Freire1970"/&gt; with a focus on dialogical reflection and action as means to overcome relations of domination and subordination between oppressors and the oppressed, colonizers and the colonized. The approach implies that "the silenced are not just incidental to the curiosity of the researcher but are the masters of inquiry into the underlying causes of the events in their world".&lt;ref name="Freire1982"/&gt; Although a researcher and a sociologist, [[Orlando Fals Borda|Fals Borda]] also has a profound distrust of conventional academia and great confidence in popular knowledge, sentiments that have had a lasting impact on the history of PAR, particularly in the fields of development,&lt;ref name="Tandon2002"/&gt; literacy,&lt;ref name="FalsBordaRahman1991"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Quigley2000"/&gt; [[counterhegemony|counterhegemonic]] education as well as [[youth engagement]] on issues ranging from violence to criminality, racial or sexual discrimination, educational justice, healthcare and the environment.&lt;ref name="CarrKemmis1986"/&gt;&lt;ref name="FineTorre2008"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NoffkeSomekh2009"/&gt;

[[Community-based participatory research]] and [[service-learning]] are a more recent attempts to reconnect academic interests with education and community development.&lt;ref name="Brulin1998"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ennals2004"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Harkavy2000"/&gt;&lt;ref name="KaslYorks2002"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Pine2009"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Westfall2006"/&gt; The [http://communityresearchcanada.ca Global Alliance on Community-Engaged Research] is a promising effort to "use knowledge and community-university partnership strategies for democratic social and environmental change and justice, particularly among the most vulnerable people and places of the world." It calls for the active involvement of community members and researchers in all phases of the action inquiry process, from defining relevant research questions and topics to designing and implementing the investigation, sharing the available resources, acknowledging community-based expertise, and making the results accessible and understandable to community members and the broader public. Service learning or education is a closely related endeavour designed to encourage students to actively apply knowledge and skills to local situations, in response to local needs and with the active involvement of community members.&lt;ref name="Moely2009"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Peters2004"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Reardon1998"/&gt; Many online or printed guides now show how students and faculty can engage in community-based participatory research and meet academic standards at the same time.&lt;ref name="CoghlanBrannick2007"/&gt;&lt;ref name="HerrAnderson2005"/&gt;&lt;ref name="James2007"/&gt;&lt;ref name="James2011"/&gt;&lt;ref name="KemmisMcTaggart1982"/&gt;&lt;ref name="KemmisMcTaggart2000"/&gt;&lt;ref name="McNiffWhitehead2006"/&gt;&lt;ref name="McNiffWhitehead2009"/&gt;&lt;ref name="McTaggart1997"/&gt;&lt;ref name="McNiff2010"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ShermanTorbert2000"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Smith2010"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Stringer2007"/&gt;

Collaborative research in education is community-based research where pre-university teachers are the community and scientific knowledge is built on top of teachers' own interpretation of their experience and reality, with or without immediate engagement in transformative action.&lt;ref name="Bourassa2007"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Desgagné2001"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Schön1983"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Sebillotte2007"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Whitehead1993"/&gt;&lt;ref name="WhiteheadMcNiff2006"/&gt;

===Public health===
PAR has made important inroads in the field of public health, in areas such as [[emergency management|disaster relief]], [[community-based rehabilitation]], accident prevention, hospital care and drug prevention.&lt;ref name="Catley2009"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ChevalierBuckles2013ch10ch15"/&gt;&lt;ref name="DeKoningMartin1996"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Eisenberg2006"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hills2007"/&gt;&lt;ref name="MinklerWallerstein2008"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Todhunter2001"/&gt;

Because of its link to radical democratic struggles of the [[Civil Rights Movement]] and other social movements in South Asia and Latin America (see above), PAR is seen as a threat to their authority by some established elites. An international alliance university-based participatory researchers, ICPHR, omit the word "Action", preferring the less controversial term "participatory research".
Photovoice is one of the strategies used in PAR and is especially useful in the public health domain. Keeping in mind the purpose of PAR, which is to benefit communities, Photovoice allows the same to happen through the media of photography. Photovoice considers helping community issues and problems reach policy makers as its primary goal.&lt;ref name="Wang1999"/&gt;

=== Occupational health and safety ===
Participatory programs within the workplace involve employees within all levels of a workplace organization, from management to front-line staff, in the design and implementation of health and safety interventions.&lt;ref name="uml.edu"&gt;{{Cite web|title = CPH-NEW Healthy Work Participatory Program|url = http://www.uml.edu/Research/Centers/CPH-NEW/Healthy-Work-Participatory-Program/Benefit/WhyPartic.aspx|website = www.uml.edu|accessdate = 2015-09-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some research has shown that interventions are most successful when front-line employees have a fundamental role in designing workplace interventions.&lt;ref name="uml.edu"/&gt; Success through participatory programs may be due to a number of factors. Such factors include a better identification of potential barriers and facilitators, a greater willingness to accept interventions than those imposed strictly from
upper management, and enhanced buy-in to intervention design, resulting in greater sustainability though promotion and acceptance.&lt;ref name="uml.edu"/&gt;&lt;ref name="journals.lww.com"&gt;{{Cite web|title = The Intervention Design and Analysis Scorecard:  A Planning... : Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine|url = http://journals.lww.com/joem/Fulltext/2013/12001/The_Intervention_Design_and_Analysis_Scorecard___A.16.aspx|accessdate = 2015-09-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;  When designing an intervention, employees are able to consider lifestyle and other behavioral influences into solution activities that go beyond the immediate workplace.&lt;ref name="journals.lww.com"/&gt;

===Feminism and gender===
[[Feminism|Feminist research]] and [[women's development theory]]&lt;ref name="Belenky1986"/&gt; also contributed to rethinking the role of scholarship in challenging existing regimes of power, using qualitative and interpretive methods that emphasize subjectivity and self-inquiry rather than the quantitative approach of mainstream science.&lt;ref name="MinklerWallerstein2008"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Brydon-Miller2003"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Maguire1987"/&gt;&lt;ref name="McIntyre2008"/&gt;&lt;ref name="TolmanBrydon-Miller2001"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Vickers2006"/&gt;&lt;ref name="WilliamsLykes2003"/&gt;

===Civic engagement and ICT===
Novel approaches to PAR in the public sphere help scale up the engaged inquiry process beyond small [[group dynamics]]. [[Alain Touraine|Touraine]] and others thus propose a 'sociology of intervention' involving the creation of artificial spaces for movement activists and non-activists to debate issues of public concern.&lt;ref name="Touraine1980"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Dubet1991"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Dubet2001"/&gt; [[Citizen science]] is another recent move to expand the scope of PAR, to include broader 'communities of interest' and citizens committed to enhancing knowledge in particular fields. In this approach to collaborative inquiry, research is actively assisted by volunteers who form an active public or network of contributing individuals.&lt;ref name="Cooper2007"/&gt;&lt;ref name="GaventaBarrett2010"/&gt; Efforts to promote [[public participation]] in the works of science owe a lot to the revolution in [[information and communications technology]] (ICT). [[Web 2.0]] applications support virtual community interactivity and the development of user-driven content and social media, without restricted access or controlled implementation. They extend principles of [[open-source governance]] to democratic institutions, allowing citizens to actively engage in wiki-based processes of virtual journalism, public debate and policy development.&lt;ref name="Rushkoff2004"/&gt; Although few and far between, experiments in open politics can thus make use of ICT and the mechanics of [[e-democracy]] to facilitate communications on a large scale, towards achieving decisions that best serve the public interest.

In the same spirit, discursive or [[deliberative democracy]] calls for public discussion, transparency and pluralism in political decision-making, lawmaking and institutional life.&lt;ref name="Bessette1994"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Cohen1989"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Epstein2012"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Forester1999"/&gt; Fact-finding and the outputs of science are made accessible to participants and may be subject to extensive media coverage, scientific peer review, deliberative opinion polling and adversarial presentations of competing arguments and predictive claims.&lt;ref name="Fishkin2009"/&gt; The methodology of [[Citizens' jury]] is interesting in this regard. It involves people selected at random from a local or national population who are provided opportunities to question 'witnesses' and collectively form a 'judgment' on the issue at hand.&lt;ref name="Wakeford2007"/&gt;

ICTs, open politics and deliberative democracy usher in new strategies to engage governments, scientists, civil society organizations and interested citizens in policy-related discussions of science and technology. These trends represent an invitation to explore novel ways of doing PAR on a broader scale.&lt;ref name="ChevalierBuckles2013"/&gt;

==Ethics==
Calls for norms of ethical conduct to guide the relationship between researchers and participants are many. Norms in [[research ethics]] involving humans include respect for the autonomy of individuals and groups to deliberate about a decision and act on it. This principle is usually expressed through the free, [[informed consent|informed and ongoing consent]] of those participating in research (or those representing them in the case of persons lacking the capacity to decide). Another mainstream principle is the welfare of participants who should not be exposed to any unfavourable balance of benefits and risks with participation in research aimed at the advancement of knowledge, especially those that are serious and probable. Since privacy is a factor that contributes to people's welfare, confidentiality obtained through the collection and use of data that are anonymous (e.g. survey data) or anonymized tends to be the norm. Finally, the principle of justice—equal treatment and concern for fairness and equity—calls for measures of appropriate inclusion and mechanisms to address conflicts of interests.

While the choice of appropriate norms of ethical conduct is rarely an either/or question, PAR implies a different understanding of what consent, welfare and justice entail. For one thing the people involved are not mere 'subjects' or 'participants'. They act instead as key partners in an inquiry process that may take place outside the walls of academic or corporate science. As Canada's Tri-Council Policy Statement: Ethical Conduct for Research Involving Humans suggests, PAR requires that the terms and conditions of the collaborative process be set out in a research agreement or protocol based on mutual understanding of the project goals and objectives between the parties, subject to preliminary discussions and negotiations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pre.ethics.gc.ca/eng/policy-politique/initiatives/tcps2-eptc2/Default/|title=TCPS 2 (2014)— the latest edition of Tri-Council Policy Statement: Ethical Conduct for Research Involving Humans|publisher=Panel on Research Ethics}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike individual consent forms, these terms of reference (ToR) may acknowledge collective rights, interests and mutual obligations.  While they are legalistic in their genesis, they are usually based on interpersonal relationships and a history of trust rather than the language of legal forms and contracts.

Another implication of PAR ethics is that partners must protect themselves and each other against potential risks, by mitigating the negative consequences of their collaborative work and pursuing the welfare of all parties concerned. This does not preclude battles against dominant interests. Given their commitment to social justice and transformative action, some PAR projects may be critical of existing social structures and struggle against the policies and interests of individuals, groups and institutions accountable for their actions, creating circumstances of danger.

On the matter of welfare, [[empowerment]] through recognition and 'being heard' may be more important to the research than are privacy and confidentiality. It is important to strike a balance between allowing privacy and confidentiality, and respect for individuals and groups who wish to be heard and identified for their contribution to research.  The former may be hard to reconcile with PAR.  The latter can be shown through proper quoting, acknowledgements, co-authorship, or the granting of [[intellectual property]] rights.

By definition, PAR is always a step into the unknown, raising new questions and creating new risks over time. Given its [[emergent properties]] and responsiveness to social context and needs, PAR cannot limit discussions and decisions about ethics to the design and proposal phase. Norms of ethical conduct and their implications may have to be revisited as the project unfolds.&lt;ref name="ChevalierBuckles2013ch8"/&gt;  This has implications, both in resources and practice, for the ability to subject the research to true ethical oversight in the way that traditional research has come to be regulated.

==Challenges==
PAR offers a long history of experimentation with evidence-based and people-based inquiry, a groundbreaking alternative to mainstream positive science. As with positivism, the approach creates many challenges&lt;ref name="PhillipsKristiansen2012"/&gt; as well as debates on what counts as participation, action and research. Differences in theoretical commitments (Lewinian, Habermasian, Freirean, psychoanalytic, feminist, etc.) and methodological inclinations (quantitative, qualitative, mixed) are numerous and profound.&lt;ref name="ChevalierBuckles2013"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Gergen2009"/&gt;&lt;ref name="GreenwoodLevin2006"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Heikkinen2001"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Johannessen1996"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Masters1995"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NielsenSvensson2006"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Shotter2012"/&gt; This is not necessarily a problem, given the pluralistic value system built into PAR. Ways to better answer questions pertaining to PAR's relationship with science and social history are nonetheless key to its future.

One critical question concerns the problem-solving orientation of engaged inquiry—the rational means-ends focus of most PAR experiments as they affect organizational performance or material livelihoods, for instance. In the clinical perspective of French psychosociology, a pragmatic orientation to inquiry neglects forms of understanding and consciousness that are not strictly [[instrumentalism|instrumental]] and rational.&lt;ref name="Michelot2008"/&gt; PAR must pay equal attention the interconnections of self-awareness, the unconscious and life in society.

Another issue, more widely debated, is scale—how to address broad-based systems of power and issues of [[complexity]], especially those of [[alter-globalization|another development]] on a global scale.&lt;ref name="ChevalierBuckles2013"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Burns2007"/&gt;&lt;ref name="WernerTotterdill2004"/&gt; How can PAR develop a macro-orientation to democratic dialogue&lt;ref name="Gustavsen1985"/&gt; and meet challenges of the 21st Century, by joining movements to support justice and solidarity on both local and global scales? By keeping things closely tied to local [[group dynamics]], PAR runs the risk of substituting small-scale participation for genuine democracy and fails to develop strategies for social transformation on all levels.&lt;ref name="HickeyMohan2005"/&gt; Given its political implications,&lt;ref name="Chambers1983"/&gt; community-based action research and its consensus ethos have been known to fall prey to powerful stakeholders and serve as Trojan horses to bring global and environmental restructuring processes directly to local settings, bypassing legitimate institutional buffers and obscuring diverging interests and the exercise of power during the process. Cooptation can lead to highly manipulated outcomes.&lt;ref name="Brown2004"/&gt;&lt;ref name="CookeKothari2001"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Rocheleau1994"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Triulzi2001"/&gt; Against this criticism, others argue that, given the right circumstances, it is possible to build institutional arrangements for joint learning and action across regional and national borders that can have impacts on citizen action, national policies and global discourses.&lt;ref name="GaventaTandon2010"/&gt;&lt;ref name="BrownGaventa2010"/&gt;

The role of science and scholarship in PAR is another source of difference.&lt;ref name="Stoecker1999"/&gt; In the Lewinian tradition, "there is nothing so practical as a good theory".&lt;ref name="Lewin1951p169"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Gustavsen2008"/&gt; Accordingly, the scientific logic of developing theory, forming and testing hypotheses, gathering measurable data and interpreting the results plays a central role. While more clinically oriented, psychosociology in France also emphasizes the distinctive role of formal research and academic work, beyond problem solving in specific contexts.&lt;ref name="Dubost1987pp90–101"/&gt; Many PAR practitioners critical of mainstream science and its overemphasis on quantitative data also point out that research based on [[qualitative research|qualitative methods]] may be theoretically-informed and rigorous in its own way.&lt;ref name="McNiffWhitehead2009"/&gt; In other traditions, however, PAR keeps great distance from both academic and corporate science. Given their emphasis on pluralism and living knowledge, many practitioners of grassroots inquiry are critical of grand theory and advanced methods for collaborative inquiry, to the point of abandoning the word "research" altogether, as in participatory [[action learning]]. Others equate research with any involvement in reflexive practice aimed at assessing problems and evaluating project or program results against group expectations. As a result, inquiry methods tend to be soft and theory remains absent or underdeveloped. Practical and theoretical efforts to overcome this ambivalence towards scholarly activity are nonetheless emerging.&lt;ref name="ReasonBradbury2008"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ChevalierBuckles2013"/&gt;

[[File:Contour map software screen snapshot of isopach map for 8500ft deep OIL reservoir with a Fault line.jpg|thumb| Example of a map used by reservoir engineers to determine where to drill a well. This screenshot is of a structure map generated by contour map software for an 8500 ft deep gas and [[oil reservoir]] in the Earth field, [[Vermilion Parish]], Erath, Louisiana. The left-to-right gap near the top of the [[contour map]] indicates a [[fault line]]. This fault line is between the blue/green contour lines and the purple/red/yellow contour lines. The thin red circular contour line in the middle of the map indicates the top of the oil reservoir. Because gas floats above oil, the thin red contour line marks the gas/oil contact zone.]]

'''Petroleum engineering''' is a field of [[engineering]] concerned with the activities related to the production of [[hydrocarbons]], which can be either [[crude oil]] or [[natural gas]].&lt;ref name="pet eng 2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bls.gov/ooh/architecture-and-engineering/petroleum-engineers.htm#tab-2|title=Petroleum Engineers: Occupational Outlook Handbook: U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics|website=www.bls.gov|language=en-us|access-date=2018-02-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Exploration and production are deemed to fall within the [[Upstream (oil industry)|''upstream'']] sector of the oil and gas industry. [[Hydrocarbon exploration|Exploration]], by earth scientists, and petroleum engineering are the oil and gas industry's two main subsurface disciplines, which focus on maximizing economic recovery of hydrocarbons from subsurface reservoirs. [[Petroleum geology]] and [[geophysics]] focus on provision of a static description of the hydrocarbon reservoir rock, while petroleum engineering focuses on estimation of the recoverable volume of this resource using a detailed understanding of the physical behavior of oil, water and gas within porous rock at very high pressure.

The combined efforts of geologists and petroleum engineers throughout the life of a hydrocarbon accumulation determine the way in which a reservoir is developed and depleted, and usually they have the highest impact on field economics. Petroleum engineering requires a good knowledge of many other related disciplines, such as geophysics, petroleum geology, [[formation evaluation]] ([[well logging]]), [[drilling]], [[economics]], [[reservoir simulation]], [[reservoir engineering]], well engineering, [[artificial lift]] systems, completions and [[petroleum production engineering]].

Recruitment to the industry has historically been from the disciplines of physics, chemical engineering and mining engineering. Subsequent development training has usually been done within oil companies.

== Overview ==
The profession got its start in 1914 within the [[American Institute of Mining, Metallurgical, and Petroleum Engineers|American Institute of Mining, Metallurgical and Petroleum Engineers]] (AIME). The first Petroleum Engineering degree was conferred in 1915 by the University of Pittsburgh.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Petroleum Engineering|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/454409/petroleum-engineering#toc64689|publisher=Britannica|accessdate=3 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, the profession has evolved to solve increasingly difficult situations. Improvements in computer modeling, materials and the application of statistics, probability analysis, and new technologies like [[horizontal drilling]] and [[enhanced oil recovery]], have drastically improved the toolbox of the petroleum engineer in recent decades. Automation,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.spe.org/en/jpt/topics/?topic=14|title=Drilling Automation|last=|first=|date=December 14, 2017|website=Journal of Petroleum Technology|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; sensors,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.spe.org/en/jpt/jpt-article-detail/?art=2295|title=JPT Flow Sensor Technology Seeks to Replace the Coriolis Meter|website=www.spe.org|access-date=2017-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; and robots&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.spe.org/en/jpt/jpt-article-detail/?art=2313|title=JPT Competing Companies Building Robots to Place Receivers|website=www.spe.org|access-date=2017-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.spe.org/en/jpt/jpt-article-detail/?art=3209|title=JPT Robot Removes Operators From Extreme Environments|website=www.spe.org|access-date=2017-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; are being used to propel the industry to more efficiency and safety. 

Deep-water, arctic and desert conditions are usually contended with. High temperature and high pressure (HTHP) environments have become increasingly commonplace in operations and require the petroleum engineer to be savvy in topics as wide-ranging as thermo-hydraulics, geomechanics, and intelligent systems.

The [[Society of Petroleum Engineers]] (SPE) is the largest [[professional society]] for petroleum engineers and publishes much technical information and other resources to support the oil and gas industry. It provides free online education (webinars), mentoring, and access to SPE Connect, an exclusive platform for members to discuss technical issues, best practices, and other topics. SPE members also are able to access the SPE Competency Management Tool to find knowledge and skill strengths and opportunities for growth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.spe.org/memberbasics/documents/ResourceGuide.pdf|title=SPE Member Resource Guide|last=|first=|date=|website=Society of Petroleum Engineers|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=December 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; SPE publishes peer-reviewed journals, books, and magazines.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.spe.org/publications/|title=Publications {{!}} The Society of Petroleum Engineers|website=www.spe.org|access-date=2017-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; SPE members receive a complimentary subscription to the ''Journal of Petroleum Technology'' and discounts on SPE's other publications.&lt;ref name="spe benefits"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.spe.org/members/benefits.php|title=Professional Membership Benefits {{!}} Society of Petroleum Engineers|website=www.spe.org|access-date=2017-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; SPE members also receive discounts on registration fees for SPE organized events and training courses.&lt;ref name="spe benefits"/&gt; SPE provides scholarships and fellowships to undergraduate and graduate students. 

According to the United States Department of Labor's Bureau of Labor Statics, petroleum engineers are required to have a bachelor's degree in engineering, generally a degree focused on petroleum engineering is preferred, but degrees in mechanical, chemical, and civil engineering are satisfactory as well.&lt;ref name="pet eng"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bls.gov/ooh/architecture-and-engineering/petroleum-engineers.htm|title=Petroleum Engineers: Occupational Outlook Handbook: U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics|website=www.bls.gov|language=en-us|access-date=2018-02-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Petroleum engineering education is available at many universities in the [[United States]] and throughout the world - primarily in oil producing regions.

=== Petroleum engineering salaries ===
Petroleum engineering has historically been one of the highest paid engineering disciplines, although there is a tendency for mass layoffs when oil prices decline and waves of hiring as prices rise. SPE annually conducts a [[salary survey]]. In 2017, SPE reported that the average SPE professional member reported earning USD $194,649 (including salary and bonus), and the average base pay was USD $151,122.&lt;ref name="spe salary survey1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.spe.org/industry/oil-and-gas-salary-survey/|title=Oil and Gas Pay {{!}} Salary Survey {{!}} Society of Petroleum Engineers|website=www.spe.org|access-date=2017-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; The average base pay reported in 2016 was $143,006.&lt;ref name="spe salary survey1"/&gt; Base pay and other compensation was on average was highest in the United States where the base pay was USD $174,283. Drilling and production engineers tended to make the best base pay, USD $160,026 for drilling engineers and USD $158,964 for production engineers. Base pay on average ranged from USD $96,382-174,283.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.spe.org/industry/docs/2017-Salary-Survey-Highlight-Report.pdf|title=2017 SPE Membership Salary Survey Highlight Report-November 2017|last=|first=|date=January 3, 2018|website=Society of Petroleum Engineers|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=January 3, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are still significant gender pay gaps, but in 2017 more than half of female respondents reported an increase in base pay received since 2016.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In 2016, the United States Department of Labor's Bureau of Labor Statistics reported the median pay for petroleum engineers was USD $18,230, or roughly $61.65 per hour.&lt;ref name="pet eng"/&gt;&lt;ref name="pet eng 5"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bls.gov/ooh/architecture-and-engineering/petroleum-engineers.htm#tab-5|title=Petroleum Engineers: Occupational Outlook Handbook: U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics|website=www.bls.gov|language=en-us|access-date=2018-02-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same summary projects that there will be 15% job growth in this field from 2016 to 2026.&lt;ref name="pet eng 5"/&gt; Also in 2016, ''U.S. News &amp; World Report'' named petroleum engineering the top college major in terms of highest median annual wages of college-educated workers (age 25-59).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.usnews.com/education/best-colleges/paying-for-college/articles/2016-05-17/top-10-college-majors-that-earn-the-highest-salaries|title=Top 10 College Majors That Earn the Highest Salaries|last=|first=|date=February 6, 2018|website=U.S. News &amp; World Report|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 2010 [[National Association of Colleges and Employers]] survey showed petroleum engineers as the highest paid 2010 graduates, at an average annual salary of $125,220.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.naceweb.org/Press/Releases/Top-Paid_Majors_Among_College_Class_of_2010_(3-11-10).aspx |title=NACE: |publisher=Naceweb.org |date= |accessdate=2011-12-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; For individuals with experience, salaries can range from $170,000 to $260,000. They make an average of $112,000 a year and about $53.75 per hour. In a 2007 article, Forbes.com reported that petroleum engineering was the 24th best paying job in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/2007/06/04/jobs-careers-compensation-lead-careers-cx_pm_0604jobs.html |title=America's Best- And Worst-Paying Jobs |publisher=Forbes.com |date= 2007-06-04|accessdate=2011-12-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

== Sub-disciplines ==
Petroleum engineers divide themselves into several types:&lt;ref name="pet eng 2"/&gt;
* [[Reservoir engineers]] work to optimize production of oil and gas via proper placement, production rates, and enhanced oil recovery techniques.
* [[Drilling engineering|Drilling engineers]] manage the technical aspects of drilling exploratory, production and injection wells.
* [[Subsurface engineer|Completion engineers]] (also known as subsurface engineers) work to design and oversee the implementation of techniques aimed at ensuring wells are drilled stably and with the maximum opportunity for oil and gas production. 
* [[Petroleum production engineering|Production engineers]] manage the interface between the reservoir and the well, including perforations, sand control, downhole flow control, and downhole monitoring equipment; evaluate [[artificial lift]] methods; and select surface equipment that separates the produced fluids (oil, natural gas, and water).

[[File:Rip current warning signs at Mission Beach.JPG|thumb|300px|Rip current warning signs posted in English and Spanish at [[Mission Beach, San Diego]], California]]
[[File:Backcomp.gif|thumb|300px|Diagram from above of the workings of a rip current: breaking waves cross a sand bar off the shore. The pushed-in water can most easily travel back out to sea through a gap in the sand bar. This creates a fast-moving rip current.]]

A '''rip current''', often simply called a '''rip''', or by the misnomer ''[[rip tide]]'', is a specific kind of water current which can occur near beaches with breaking waves. A rip is a strong, localized, and narrow current of water which moves directly away from the [[shore]], cutting through the lines of breaking waves like a river running out to sea, and is strongest near the surface of the water.&lt;ref name=udel&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.ceoe.udel.edu/ripcurrents/characteristics/| title=Rip Current Characteristics| website=College of Earth, Ocean, and Environment, University of Delaware| access-date=2009-01-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rip currents can be hazardous to people in the water. Swimmers who are caught in a rip current and who do not understand what is going on, and who may not have the necessary water skills, may panic, or exhaust themselves by trying to swim directly against the flow of water. Because of these factors, rips are the leading cause of rescues by lifeguards at beaches, and rips are the cause of an average of 46 deaths by drowning per year in the [[United States]].

A rip current is not the same thing as [[Undertow (water waves)|undertow]], although some people use the term incorrectly when they often mean  a rip current. Contrary to popular belief, neither rip nor undertow can pull a person down and hold them under the water. A rip simply carries floating objects, including people, out beyond the zone of the breaking waves.

==Causes and occurrence==
&lt;!--causes--&gt;A rip current forms because [[wind]] and breaking waves push surface water towards the land, and this causes a slight rise in the water level along the shore. This excess water will tend to flow back to the open water via the route of least resistance. When there is a local area which is slightly deeper, or a break in an offshore sand bar or reef, this can allow water to flow offshore more easily, and this will initiate a rip current through that gap. 

Water that has been pushed up near the beach flows along the shore towards the outgoing rip as "feeder currents", and then the excess water flows out at a right angle to the beach, in a tight current called the "neck" of the rip. The "neck" is where the flow is most rapid. When the water in the rip current reaches outside of the lines of breaking waves, the flow disperses sideways, loses power, and dissipates in what is known as the "head" of the rip.

&lt;!--occurrence--&gt;Rip currents can often occur on a gradually shelving shore where breaking waves approach the shore parallel to it, or where underwater topography encourages outflow at a specific area. Rip currents can form at the coasts of oceans, seas, and large lakes, whenever there are waves of sufficient energy. The location of rip currents can be difficult to predict; whereas some tend to recur always in the same places, others can appear and disappear suddenly at various locations along the beach. The appearance and disappearance of rip currents is dependent on the bottom topography and the exact direction that the surf and swells are coming in from.&lt;ref name=USLA&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.usla.org/ripcurrents/ |title=Rip Currents |publisher=United States Lifesaving Association |access-date=2009-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rip currents can potentially occur wherever there is strong longshore variability in wave breaking. This variability may be caused by such features as sandbars (as shown in the animated diagram), by [[pier]]s and [[jetty|jetties]], and even by crossing [[Wind wave|wave trains]], and are often located in places such as where there is a gap in a [[reef]] or low area on a [[Shoal|sandbar]]. Rip currents may deepen the channel through a sandbar once they have formed.

&lt;!--notoriety--&gt;Rip currents are usually quite narrow, but tend to be more common, wider, and faster, when and where breaking waves are large and powerful. Local underwater [[topography]] makes some beaches more likely to have rip currents; a few beaches are notorious in this respect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.berkeley.edu/news/media/releases/2002/05/23_tides.html| title=Rip currents at Ocean Beach are severe hazard for unwary, UC Berkeley expert warns| website=[[University of California, Berkeley]]| date=2002-05-23| access-date=2018-01-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!--clarification of misconceptions--&gt;Although ''rip tide'' is a misnomer, in areas of significant tidal range, rip currents may only occur at certain stages of the tide, when the water is shallow enough to cause the waves to break over a sand bar, but deep enough for the broken wave to flow over the bar. (In parts of the world with a big difference between high tide and low tide, and where the shoreline shelves gently, the distance between a [[shoal|bar]] and the shoreline may vary from a few feet to a mile or more, depending whether it is high tide or low tide.)

A fairly common misconception is that rip currents can pull a swimmer down, under the surface of the water. This is not true, and in reality a rip current is strongest close to the surface, as the flow near the bottom is slowed by friction. 

The surface of a rip current may appear to be a relatively smooth area of water, without any breaking waves, and this deceptive appearance may cause some beach goers to believe it is a suitable place to enter the water.&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|id=-hCZuYzNujI | title=Don't get sucked in by the rip...}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Technical explanation===
A more detailed description involves [[radiation stress]]. This is the force (or momentum flux) exerted on the water column by the presence of the wave. As a [[wave shoaling|wave shoals]] and increases in height prior to breaking, radiation stress increases.{{clarify|reason=why/how does radiation stress increase?|date=January 2017}} To balance this, the local mean surface level (the water level with the wave averaged out) drops; this is known as ''setdown''. As the wave breaks and continues to reduce in height, the radiation stress decreases.{{clarify|reason=why/how does the stress decrease|date=January 2017}} To balance this force,{{clarify|reason=how does this balance the force?|date=January 2017}} the mean surface increases&amp;nbsp;— this is known as ''setup''. As a wave propagates over a sandbar with a gap (as shown in the lead image), the wave breaks on the bar, leading to setup. However, the part of the wave that propagates over the gap does not break, and thus setdown will continue. Thus, the mean surface over the bars is higher than that over the gap, and a strong flow issues outward through the gap.{{clarify|reason=the wave over the channel will also eventually break when water is shallow enough|date=January 2017}}

==Visible signs and characteristics==
[[File:Rip current warning signs.png|thumb|Some man-made signs warning of rip currents.]]
[[File:Ripcurrent viewed sideway.jpg|thumb|Disruption in the line of a breaking wave makes a rip current visible.]]

Rip currents have a characteristic appearance, and, with some experience, they can be visually identified from the shore before entering the water. This is useful to lifeguards, swimmers, surfers, boaters, divers and other water users, who may need to avoid a rip, or in some cases make use of the current flow. Rip currents often look a bit like a road or a river running straight out to sea, and are easiest to notice and identify when the zone of breaking waves is viewed from a high vantage point. The following are some characteristics that can be used to visually identify a rip:&lt;ref name=noaa&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.ripcurrents.noaa.gov/overview.shtml| title=Rip Currents Safety| website=U.S. [[National Weather Service]]| access-date=2009-01-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* A noticeable break in the pattern of the waves&amp;nbsp;— the water often looks flat at the rip, in contrast to the lines of breaking waves on either side of the rip.
* A "river" of foam&amp;nbsp;— the surface of the rip sometimes looks foamy, because the current is carrying foam from the surf out to open water.
* Different color&amp;nbsp;— the rip may differ in color from the surrounding water; it is often more opaque, cloudier, or muddier, and so, depending on the angle of the sun, the rip may show as darker or lighter than the surrounding water.
* It is sometimes possible to see that foam or floating debris on the surface of the rip is moving out, away from the shore. In contrast, in the surrounding areas of breaking waves, floating objects are being pushed towards the shore.

These characteristics are helpful in learning to recognize and understand the nature of rip currents so that a person can recognize the presence of rips before entering the water. In the United States, some beaches have signs created by the [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]] (NOAA) and [[United States Lifesaving Association]], explaining what a rip current is and how to escape one. These signs are titled, "Rip Currents; Break the Grip of the Rip".&lt;ref name="noaanews.noaa.gov"&gt;{{cite press release |url=http://www.noaanews.noaa.gov/stories2008/20080602_ripcurrent.html |title=NOAA Reminds Swimmers That Rip Currents Can Be a Threat. Rip Current Awareness Week Is June 1–7, 2008 |publisher=National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration |date=2008-06-02 |access-date=2014-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beachgoers can get information from lifeguards, who are always watching for rip currents, and who will move their safety flags so that swimmers can avoid rips.

==Danger to swimmers==
[[File:Hanakapiai Beach Warning Sign Only.jpg|thumb|150px|Warning sign on the trail to [[Hanakapiai Beach]], Hawaii.|alt=Photo of sign reading "HANAKAPIAI BEACH WARNING! DO NOT GO NEAR THE WATER UNSEEN CURRENTS HAVE KILLED 83 (displayed as 16 groups of 4 vertical lines with 1 diagonal line marking a group of 5 and three additional lines) VISITORS]]
Rip currents are a potential source of danger for people in shallow water with breaking waves in seas, oceans and lakes.&lt;ref name=noaa /&gt; Rip currents are the proximate cause of 80% of rescues carried out by beach [[lifeguard]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ripcurrents.noaa.gov/ |title=NWS Rip Current Safety Home Page |publisher=U.S. [[National Weather Service]] |access-date=2018-01-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rip currents typically flow at about 0.5 metres per second (1–2 feet per second), but they can be as fast as 2.5 metres per second (8 feet per second), which is faster than any human can swim. However, most rip currents are fairly narrow, and even the widest rip currents are not very wide; swimmers can easily exit the rip by swimming at a right angle to the flow, parallel to the beach. Swimmers who are unaware of this fact may exhaust themselves trying unsuccessfully to swim against the flow.&lt;ref name=USLA /&gt; The flow of the current also fades out completely at the head of the rip, outside the zone of the breaking waves, so there is a definite limit to how far the swimmer will be taken out to sea by the flow of a rip current.

In a rip current, death by [[drowning]] occurs when a person has limited water skills and panics, or when a swimmer persists in trying to swim to shore against a strong rip current, thus eventually becoming exhausted and unable to stay afloat.

According to NOAA, over a 10-year average, rip currents cause 46 deaths annually in the United States, and 64 people died in rip currents in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.nws.noaa.gov/os/hazstats.shtml | title=NWS Weather Fatality, Injury and Damage Statistics| publisher=NOAA| date=2018-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the [[United States Lifesaving Association]] "estimates that the annual number of deaths due to rip currents on our nation's beaches exceeds 100."&lt;ref name="noaanews.noaa.gov" /&gt;

A study published in 2013 in Australia revealed that rips killed more people on Australian territory than bushfires, floods, cyclones and shark attacks combined.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.australiangeographic.com.au/news/2013/11/rips-bigger-killers-than-bushfires-and-sharks/| title=Rips more deadly than bushfires and sharks| publisher=[[Australian Geographic]]| access-date=2013-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Management===
[[File:Danger courant baines.jpg|thumb|A warning sign in France]]
People caught in a rip current may notice that they are moving away from the shore quite rapidly. It is often not possible to swim directly back to shore against a rip current, so this is not recommended. Contrary to popular misunderstanding, a rip does not pull a swimmer under the water, it simply carries the swimmer away from the shore in a narrow band of moving water.&lt;ref name=udel /&gt; The rip is like a moving [[treadmill]], which the swimmer can get out of by swimming across the current, parallel to the shore, in either direction, until out of the rip current, which is usually not very wide. Once out of the rip, swimming back to shore is relatively easy in areas where waves are breaking and where floating objects and swimmers are being pushed towards the shore.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.scienceofthesurf.com/| title=Beach and Surf Safety| publisher=Science of the Surf| access-date=2018-01-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As an alternative, swimmers who are caught in a strong rip can relax and go with the flow (either floating or treading water) until the current dissipates beyond the surf line, and then they can signal for help, or swim back through the surf diagonally away from the rip and towards the shore.&lt;ref name=USLA /&gt;

It is necessary for coastal swimmers to understand the danger of rip currents, to learn how to recognize them and how to deal with them, and if possible to swim in only those areas where lifeguards are on duty.&lt;ref name="noaa"/&gt;

==Uses==
Experienced and knowledgeable water users, including surfers, body boarders, [[Underwater diving|divers]], [[Surf lifesaving|surf lifesavers]] and kayakers, will sometimes use rip currents as a rapid and effortless means of transportation when they wish to get out beyond the breaking waves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last1=Cowan| first1=C.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3423">'''Scientific teaching''' is a [[pedagogy|pedagogical]] approach used in undergraduate science classrooms whereby teaching and learning is approached with the same rigor as science itself. 

According to a 2004 Policy Forum in ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'' magazine, "scientific teaching involves active learning strategies to engage students in the process of science and teaching methods that have been systematically tested and shown to reach diverse students."&lt;ref&gt;Jo Handelsman, Diane Ebert-May, Robert Beichner, Peter Bruns, Amy Chang, Robert DeHaan, Jim Gentile, Sarah Lauffer, James Stewart, Shirley M. Tilghman, and William B. Wood. (2004). "[http://scientificteaching.wisc.edu/documents/ScientificTeaching.pdf Scientific Teaching]." Science 304(5670, 23 April), 521-522.&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2007 volume ''Scientific Teaching''&lt;ref&gt;Jo Handelsman, Sarah Miller, and Christine Pfund.  (2007). [http://scientificteaching.wisc.edu/books.htm ''Scientific Teaching''].  Madison, WI; Englewood, CO; and New York: The Wisconsin Program for Scientific Teaching, Roberts &amp; Company, and W.H. Freeman.&lt;/ref&gt;  lists three major tenets of scientific teaching:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
*'''Active learning''': A process in which students are actively engaged in learning.  It may include inquiry-based learning, cooperative learning, or student-centered learning.
*'''Assessment''': Tools for measuring progress toward and achievement of the learning goals.
*'''Diversity''':  The breadth of differences that make each student unique, each cohort of students unique, and each teaching experience unique.  Diversity includes everything in the classroom: the students, the instructors, the content, the teaching methods, and the context.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

These elements should underlie educational and pedagogical decisions in the classroom. The "[[SCALE-UP]]" learning environment is an example of applying the scientific teaching approach.  In practice, scientific teaching employs a "backward design" approach.  The instructor first decides what the students should know and be able to do (learning goals), then determines what would be evidence of student achievement of the learning goals, then designs assessments to measure this achievement.  Finally, the instructor plans the learning activities, which should facilitate student learning through scientific discovery.&lt;ref&gt;D. Ebert-May and J. Hodder.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3661">'''St. George William Lane Fox-Pitt''' (born 14 September 1856 in Malta, died 6 April 1932 in South Eaton Place) was a British electrical engineer and student of psychic phenomena.

His parents were Lieutenant General [[Augustus Pitt Rivers|Augustus Henry Lane-Fox]] (1827–1900) and Alice Margaret (1828–1910, née Stanley). When his father's cousin Horace Pitt, 6th Baron Rivers, died, the family took the name ''Fox Pitt-Rivers'' on May 25, 1880.

In 1878, Fox-Pitt was granted a patent on a [[light bulb]] with a [[platinum]]-[[iridium]] filament. The patent also describes a system for [[power distribution]] using incandescent lamps in parallel.&lt;ref name="timesob"&gt;"Mr. FOX Pitt." (obituary) ''Times'' [London, England] 7 Apr. 1932: 14. The Times Digital Archive. Web. 4 Aug. 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 12 December 1879, [[Charles F. Brush|Charles Francis Brush]] founded the [[Brush Electrical Machines|Anglo American Electric Light Company Ltd.]] in the UK and then acquired the patent rights to produce the Lane-Fox incandescent lamp in the same year. On 24 March 1880, he founded a new company, Anglo-American Brush Electric Light Corporation, which took over the previous one.

About 1880, Fox-Pitt is said to have successfully experimented with charred plant fibers as the filament material. That was about the same time as the development of the light bulb with carbon filament by Edison in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20120530184716/http://www.theiet.org/about/libarc/archives/featured/lane-fox.cfm ''Lane Fox –  An Illuminating Letter''], The Institution of Engineering and Technology, accessed 29 December 2008&lt;/ref&gt; By 1883, Fox-Pitt had obtained further patents.

Fox-Pitt wrote books on the philosophy of science, education, and social problems. He was temporarily Vice President of the ''Moral Education League'' and organized the [[International Moral Education Congress]]. He was also one of the first active members of the [[Society for Psychical Research]].&lt;ref name="timesob"/&gt;

In 1891, he repurchased the patent rights of the Anglo-American Brush Electric Light Corporation and built himself a small lamp factory.

In 1898, he participated in a railway concession in [[Ecuador]].&lt;ref&gt;''The New York Times'' online archive: [https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1901/02/05/118460773.pdf ''Archer Harman is arrested, 5 February 1901''], accessed 28 December 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The New York Times'' online archive:[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9D02E4D81139EF32A25756C0A9609C946097D6CF Ecuador Railroad Suit; Shareholders Now Bring Action Against Two Companies, 5 June 1901], accessed 29 December 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1899, he married Lady Edith Gertrude Douglas (1874–1963, the daughter of [[John Sholto Douglas, 9th Marquess of Queensberry]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thepeerage.com/p5635.htm A genealogical survey of the peerage of Britain], accessed 28 December 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Court Circular."

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4102">'''Stoke Mandeville Stadium''' is the '''National Centre for Disability Sport''' in England. It is sited alongside [[Stoke Mandeville Hospital]] in [[Aylesbury]] in [[Buckinghamshire]]. Stoke Mandeville Stadium is owned  by [[WheelPower]], the national organisation for wheelchair sport. 

==History==
The stadium developed out of the Stoke Mandeville Games — the forerunner of the [[Paralympic Games]] — founded in 1948 by [[Ludwig Guttmann]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbc.ca/olympics/story/2008/09/02/f-paralympics-history.html "Paralympics traces roots to Second World War"], CBC, September 3, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; He was a neurosurgeon at the National Spinal Injuries Centre at Stoke Mandeville Hospital who recognised the value of exercise and competition in the rehabilitation of ex-members of the British armed forces. By 1961 Guttmann had founded the [[British Sports Association for the Disabled]] (now named [[English Federation of Disability Sport]]), expanding the concept of organising sport for men, women and children with disabilities and developing Stoke Mandeville Stadium into an international centre of disabled sport. The stadium was officially opened by [[Elizabeth II|Queen Elizabeth II]] on 2 August 1969.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.royalcollection.org.uk/collection/443928/medal-commemorating-the-opening-of-the-stoke-mandeville-sports-stadium-1969|title=Medal commemorating the Opening of the Stoke Mandeville Sports Stadium, 1969|publisher=Royal Collection Trust|accessdate=17 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When Sir Ludwig Guttmann died in 1980 the Stadium was renamed '''Ludwig Guttmann Sports Centre for the Disabled'''. In 1993 the Stadium hosted the first international ex-service wheelchair games, organised by the Royal British Legion and opened by King Hussein and Queen Noor of Jordan. In 2001, following a £10 million refurbishment, it was again renamed as "Stoke Mandeville Stadium". The [[List of Olympic mascots|Paralympic mascot]] [[Wenlock and Mandeville|Mandeville]] is so named due to the legacy with the games.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/olympic_games/london_2012/8690467.stm BBC Wenlock and Mandeville]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Facilities==
Facilities include a 400-metre outdoor running track, Cazenove Sports Hall, a 25m six-lane swimming pool, tennis courts and an indoor bowls arena. In addition the Stadium has its own "Olympic Village" accommodation for athletes and the Olympic Lodge Hotel and the Wolfson Conference Centre provide guest facilities.

==1984 Summer Paralympic Games==
{{main|1984 Summer Paralympics}}
Stoke Mandeville Stadium was one of the two venues of the [[1984 Summer Paralympics|VII Paralympic Games]], the last of the Summer Paralympics not held in the same venue as the Summer Olympic Games.

'''Thomas C Van Flandern''' (June 26, 1940 – January 9, 2009) was an American astronomer and author specializing in [[celestial mechanics]]. Van Flandern had a career as a professional scientist, but was noted as an outspoken proponent of non-mainstream views related to [[astronomy]], [[physics]], and [[extra-terrestrial life]]. He also published the non-mainstream ''Meta Research Bulletin''. He died of [[colon cancer]] in [[Seattle, Washington]].&lt;ref name="sequimobit"&gt;{{Cite web| url =http://www.sequimgazette.com/obituaries/article.exm/2009-01-21_obituaries |title = Obituary | publisher = [[Sequim Gazette]] | date = January 21, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Van Flandern graduated from [[Saint Ignatius High School (Cleveland)|Saint Ignatius High School]] in [[Cleveland]]. While there, he helped start the Cleveland branch of [[Operation Moonwatch]], an amateur science program initiated by the [[Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory]] to track [[satellite]]s.&lt;ref&gt;''Cleveland Plain Dealer'' October 8, 1957 "Moonwatch Team Here Gets Set" page 5&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Pharos-Tribune and Logansport Press'' August 9, 1959 "Still Keeping Watch" Logansport, IN page 19&lt;/ref&gt; He also helped found a Moonwatchers team at [[Xavier University]],&lt;ref&gt;''Xavier University News'' November 5, 1960 Mike Rogers "Satellite Spies Situate Tracking Station on Logan" page 1&lt;/ref&gt; and this team broke a tracking record in 1961.&lt;ref&gt;''Kingsport News'' May 17, 1961 "Reports Activity" page 10&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Anderson Herald'' May 17, 1961 "Cincy Moonwatchers Report on Satellites" page 2&lt;/ref&gt;

Van Flandern graduated from [[Xavier University]] [[cum laude]] with a [[Bachelor of Science|B.S.]] in Mathematics in 1962 and was awarded a teaching fellowship at [[Georgetown University]].&lt;ref&gt;''Xavier University News'' May 4, 1962 "Tom Van Flandern Given Fellowship" page 9&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="aas" /&gt; He attended [[Yale University]] on a scholarship sponsored by the [[U.S. Naval Observatory]] (USNO),{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}&lt;!-- there is no mention of him in the yearly report: http://articles.adsabs.harvard.edu//full/1962AJ.....67..608./0000670.000.html --&gt; joining USNO in 1963.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| bibcode = 1963AJ.....68..649M | title = U.S. Naval Observatory Report | author = T.

He later said, "This forced me to the 'fringes,' areas of astronomy not accepted as credible by experts of the field".&lt;ref&gt;Gonzo Science, Jim Richardson, Alan Richardson, p. 62, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

Following his separation from the USNO, Van Flandern started a business organizing [[eclipse]] viewing expeditions, and promoting his non-mainstream views in a newsletter and web site. Shortly after his death in 2009, the [[asteroid]] [[52266&amp;nbsp;Van Flandern]] was named in his honor because of his prediction and analysis of lunar occultations at the U.S. Naval Observatory and publications of papers on the dynamics of [[minor-planet moon|binary minor planets]].&lt;ref name="MPC-Van Flandern" /&gt;

== Mainstream scientific work ==

During the mid-1970s, Van Flandern believed that lunar observations gave evidence of variation in Newton's [[gravitational constant]] (''G''), consistent with a speculative idea that had been put forward by [[Paul Dirac]]. In 1974, his essay "A Determination of the Rate of Change of G" was awarded second place by the [[Gravity Research Foundation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.gravityresearchfoundation.org/winners_year.html#74 | title = Award winners | publisher = [[Gravity Research Foundation]] | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070929022056/http://www.gravityresearchfoundation.org/winners_year.html#74 | archivedate = 2007-09-29 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://www.gravityresearchfoundation.org/pdf/awarded/1974/vanflandern.pdf | title = A Determination of the Rate of Change of G | date = 1974 | author = Tom Van Flandern | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20111001230512/http://www.gravityresearchfoundation.org/pdf/awarded/1974/vanflandern.pdf | archivedate = 2011-10-01 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;
However, in later years, with new data available, Van Flandern himself admitted his findings were flawed, and the conclusions were contradicted by more accurate findings based on radio measurements with the [[Viking lander]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| page = 175- | author = Clifford Will | authorlink = Clifford Martin Will | title = Was Einstein Right?: putting general relativity to the test | publisher = [[Basic Books]] | edition = 2nd | date = 1993 | isbn = 0-465-09086-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dark Matter, Missing Planets, New Comets, Van Flandern 1993.&lt;/ref&gt;

Van Flandern and Henry Fliegel developed a compact algorithm to calculate a [[Julian date]] from a Gregorian date that would fit on a single [[Punched card|IBM card]]. They described this in a letter to the editor of a computing magazine in 1968.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Fliegel|first=Henry|title=Letters to the editor: a machine algorithm for processing calendar dates|url=http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=364096.364097|publisher=ACM|accessdate=2013-06-28|author2=Thomas C. Van Flanderen |page=657|doi=10.1145/364096.364097|date=October 1968}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was available for use in business applications.&lt;ref name="aas" /&gt;

With Kenneth Pulkkinen, he published "Low precision formulae for planetary positions", in the Astrophysical Journal Supplement in 1979.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| title = Low-Precision Formulae for Planetary Positions | author = Van Flandern, T. C. | author2 = Pulkkinen, K. F. | last-author-amp = yes | journal =

In 2003, developed the [[Van Flandern-Yang hypothesis]] with [[Xin-She Yang]] after observations made during the [[Solar eclipse of March 9, 1997]].&lt;ref&gt;T. Van Flandern and X.-S. Yang, Allais gravity and pendulum effects during solar eclipses explained, Phys. Rev. D 67 (2003) 022002&lt;/ref&gt;

== Non-mainstream science and beliefs ==

Van Flandern described in his book&lt;ref&gt;"Dark Matter, Missing Planets, New Comets", Van Flandern (1993)&lt;/ref&gt; how he had become increasingly dissatisfied with the mainstream view of science by the early 1980s. He wrote

::''Events in my life caused me to start questioning my goals and the correctness of everything I had learned. In matters of religion, medicine, biology, physics, and other fields, I came to discover that reality differed seriously from what I had been taught.''

In his book, on blogs, lectures, newsletter and web site, Van Flandern focused on problems with [[List of unsolved problems in physics|cosmology and physics theories]]. He alleged that when experimental evidence is incompatible with mainstream scientific theories, that mainstream scientists refuse to acknowledge this to avoid jeopardizing their funding.&lt;ref name="aas" /&gt;

=== Deep Reality Physics ===

Van Flandern espoused a set of principles for assessing ideas, and dubbed theories that he deemed compliant with these principles as "Deep Reality Physics." He claimed that mainstream scientific theories, especially the prevailing theories regarding the [[big bang]], [[solar system formation]], relativity, and electrodynamics, [[List of unsolved problems in physics#cosmology and general relativity|left unanswered questions]] and therefore did not meet his criteria and often advocated his own replacement theories. Van Flandern's seven principles were:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://metaresearch.org/cosmology/PhysicsHasItsPrinciples.asp |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-01-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160104212720/http://www.metaresearch.org/cosmology/PhysicsHasItsPrinciples.asp |archivedate=2016-01-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

:::No time reversal
:::No true action at a distance
:::No creation ex nihilo
:::No demise ad nihil
:::The finite cannot become infinite
:::Tangible, material entities cannot occupy the same space at the same time

=== Minor-planet satellites ===

Following claims by David Dunham in 1978 to have detected [[Minor-planet moon|satellites for some asteroids]] (notably [[532 Herculina]]) by examining the light patterns during stellar occultations,&lt;ref name="Dunham-1978" /&gt; Van Flandern and others began to report similar observations.&lt;ref&gt;Van Flandern, T. C., Tedesco, E. F. &amp; Binzel, R. P. in Asteroids (ed. Gehrels, T.) 443–465 (Univ. Ariz. Press, Tucson, 1979).&lt;/ref&gt; His non-mainstream 1978 prediction that some asteroids have natural satellites, which was almost universally rejected, was proven correct when the ''[[Galileo (spacecraft)|Galileo]]'' spacecraft photographed Dactyl, a satellite of [[243&amp;nbsp;Ida]], during its flyby in 1993.&lt;ref name="aas" /&gt;

=== Exploding Planets ===

In 1976, while Van Flandern was employed by the USNO, he began to promote the belief that [[Fifth planet (hypothetical)#The Disruption Theory|major planets sometimes explode]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://metaresearch.org/solar%20system/eph/eph2000.asp |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-06-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130407233124/http://metaresearch.org/solar%20system/eph/eph2000.asp |archivedate=2013-04-07 |df= }} According to Van Flandern's article on the Exploded Planet Hypothesis "The third planetary explosion mechanism relies on one other hypothesis not yet widely accepted, but holds out the potential for an indefinitely large reservoir of energy for exploding even massive planets and stars. If gravitational fields are continually regenerated, as in LeSage particle models of gravity [xvi], then all masses are continually absorbing energy from this universal flux."&lt;/ref&gt; In his "Exploded Planet Hypothesis 2000" he lists as possible reasons for explosion either a runaway nuclear reaction in uranium in the core, a change of state as the planet cools down, creating a density phase change (like water to ice) and causing it to implode or explode, or absorption of heat from [[Le Sage's theory of gravitation|gravitons]].&lt;ref&gt;Van Flandern, Tom.

North Atlantic Books, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; In his book Van Flandern described the negative reception of his ideas about exploding planets among mainstream scientists.  Van Flandern also speculated that the origin of the human species may well have been on the planet Mars, which he believed was once a moon of a now-exploded "[[Phaeton (hypothetical planet)|Planet V]]".

=== Le Sage's theory of gravitation and the speed of gravity ===

Van Flandern supported [[Le Sage]]'s discredited&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Pushing Gravity: New Perspectives on Le Sage's Theory of Gravitation |edition=illustrated |first1=Matthew R. |last1=Edwards |publisher=Indiana University |year=2002 |isbn=978-0-9683689-7-8 |page=65 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ggoIAQAAMAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Le Sage's theory of gravitation|theory of gravitation]], according to which gravity is the result of a flux of invisible "ultra-mundane corpuscles" impinging on all objects from all directions at superluminal speeds. He gave public lectures in which he claimed that these particles could be used as a limitless source of free energy, and to provide superluminal propulsion for spacecraft.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| author = Jeffery D. Kooistra | title = Conference on Future Energy|journal = [[Infinite Energy Magazine]] | issue = 26 | date = July–August 1999}} An editor gave a summary of Van Flandern's talk at the Infinite Energy conference and wrote "Van Flandern gave a talk entitled 'On a Complete Theory of Gravity and Free Energy'. For the free energy enthusiast, the implications of gravity being particulate and perhaps blockable are obvious. Block or deflect the c-gravitons raining down from the sky and up you go into space. Turn off the blocking shield and recover the energy you've gained, for free, as you fall back to Earth."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51aJobWkrig| title = Dr. Thomas Van Flandern – MUFON-LA (1 of 1) | publisher = youtube}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also speculated that the ultra-mundane flux caused the explosion of a major planet once located between Mars and Jupiter.

In 1998 Van Flandern wrote a paper&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1016/S0375-9601(98)00650-1 | title = The speed of gravity ?

=== Face on Mars ===

Van Flandern was a prominent advocate of the belief that certain geological features seen on Mars, especially the "[[Cydonia face|face at Cydonia]]", are not of natural origin, but were produced by intelligent extra-terrestrial life, probably the inhabitants of a major planet once located where the asteroid belt presently exists, and which Van Flandern believed had exploded 3.2 million years ago.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.metaresearch.org/solar%20system/cydonia/proof_files/proof.asp |title=Proof that the Cydonia Face on Mars is Artificial |publisher=Metaresearch.org |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20021123170349/http://www.metaresearch.org/solar%20system/cydonia/proof_files/proof.asp |archivedate=2002-11-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The claimed artificiality of the "face" was also the topic of a chapter of his 1993 book.&lt;ref name="Flandern1998"&gt;{{cite book|author=Tom Van Flandern|title=Dark Matter, Missing Planets and New Comets: Paradoxes Resolved, Origins Illuminated|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fq8trtkOvMEC&amp;pg=PA417|date=1993|publisher=[[North Atlantic Books]]|isbn=978-1-55643-268-2|location=chapter 24. New Evidence for Artificiality at Cydonia on Mars}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also gave lectures on the subject,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkXsQbaDg5g| title = Mysterious Mars | publisher = youtube}}&lt;/ref&gt; and at the conclusion of the lectures he described his overall conception:{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}

When it was first imaged, and into the 21st century, the "Face" is near universally accepted to be an [[optical illusion]], an example of [[pareidolia]], and theories that it was an artificial artifact were considered to be pseudo-science.&lt;ref name=cnnface&gt;{{Cite web|last=Britt|first=R.R.|url=http://www.cnn.com/2004/TECH/space/03/17/alien.debunk/index.html|title=Scientist attacks alien claims on Mars|publisher=CNN|date=March 18, 2004|accessdate=October 12, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| url = http://www.astrosociety.org/education/resources/pseudobib03.html| title = Astronomical Pseudo-Science: A Skeptic's Resource List| publisher = Astronomical Society of the Pacific| deadurl = yes| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20101120071353/http://astrosociety.org/education/resources/pseudobib03.html| archivedate = 2010-11-20| df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; After analysis of the higher resolution [[Mars Global Surveyor]] data [[NASA]] stated that "a detailed analysis of multiple images of this feature reveals a natural looking Martian hill whose illusory face-like appearance depends on the viewing angle and angle of [[lighting|illumination]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/multimedia/imagegallery/image_feature_60.html|title=The Face on Mars, Viking Project|publisher=[[NASA]] website|accessdate=April 26, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Rejection of Big Bang Cosmology ===

Van Flandern was a vocal opponent of the Big Bang model in cosmology, and supported instead a [[Steady state theory|Steady-State cosmology]]. He compiled a list of what he regarded as problems for the Big Bang model. It began as a list of "Top 10" problems, then expanded to the "Top 30", and ultimately by 2008 had reached the "Top 60".&lt;ref&gt;[http://metaresearch.org/cosmology/BB-top-30.asp The Top 30 Problems With the Big Bang] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130327225237/http://metaresearch.org/cosmology/BB-top-30.asp |date=2013-03-27 }}, Van Flandern's web article explaining his objections to big bang cosmology.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008 he was an organizer of a conference of individuals who oppose the Big Bang cosmological models.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.peninsuladailynews.com/article/20080911/NEWS/809110302&lt;/ref&gt; Van Flandern did not reject General Relativity as some have asserted, but rather rejected its geometrical interpretation. He said: "General relativity has a geometric and a field interpretation. If angular momentum conservation is invoked in the geometric interpretation to explain experiments, the causality principle is violated. The field interpretation avoids this problem by allowing faster-than-light propagation in forward time."&lt;ref&gt;http://aas.org/obituaries/tom-c-van-flandern-1940-2009&lt;/ref&gt;

Antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST) can be done on 96-well plates by diluting the [[antimicrobial]] agent at varying concentrations in broth inoculated with [[bacteria]] and measuring the [[minimum inhibitory concentration]] that results in no growth.  However, these methods cannot be used to study some membrane-active [[antimicrobial peptides]], which are inhibited by the broth itself.  The virtual colony count procedure takes advantage of this fact by first exposing bacterial cells to the active antimicrobial agent in a low-salt [[buffer solution|buffer]] for two hours, then simultaneously inhibiting antimicrobial activity and inducing [[exponential growth]] by adding broth.  The [[Bacterial growth|growth kinetics]] of surviving cells can then be monitored using a temperature-controlled [[plate reader]].

==Quantitative growth kinetics==

[[File:Virtual_Colony_Count_(VCC)_sextuplicate_calibration_growth_curves.png|alt=|thumb|416x416px|VCC calibration curves]]

The method of enumeration&lt;ref name="pmid12609726"&gt;{{Cite journal| author=Brewster, JD. |title=A simple micro-growth assay for enumerating bacteria. |journal= J Microbiol Methods |volume=53 |issue=1 |pages=77–86 |year= 2003 |pmid=12609726 |doi=10.1016/S0167-7012(02)00226-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; of surviving cells used by VCC is termed quantitative growth kinetics (QGK). It relates the kinetic time taken for the [[turbidity]] of a bacterial batch [[microbiological culture]] in a well of a 96-well [[microplate]] to reach a threshold difference in turbidity to a 10-fold dilution series of calibration growth curves.

Quantification of the number of viable cells is done using a process mathematically identical to quantitative [[real-time polymerase chain reaction]] (QPCR), except with QGK [[cell (biology)|cell]]s, rather than copies of PCR products, grow exponentially.  The time taken to reach the threshold is called the "threshold time", T&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt;, which is equivalent to the [[QPCR]] value "cycle time" or C&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt;.

There are at least five processes that cause delays in threshold times in VCC assays:

1.  Adhesion, causing cells to stick to the microplate and possibly form [[biofilms]].  Unless these cells happen to be directly in the light path, their growth will not affect optical density readings.

2.  Cohesion, causing cells to aggregate into clumps of various sizes instead of a homogeneous suspension of individual cells undergoing [[binary fission]].  Cohesion can cause imprecision and fluctuations in T&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt;.  Cohesive clumps may also be adhesive, leading to both imprecision due to cohesion and inaccuracy (increased T&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt;) due to adhesion.

3.  [[Bacteriostatic]] activity, causing cells to become unable to enter exponential growth even though they are not killed.  Transient bacteriostatic activity can cause lag times, increasing T&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt;.

4.  The metabolic lag phase of [[bacterial growth]].  Such a lag phase would be expected to occur in the assay as cells growing slowly or not at all during the initial exposure to antimicrobial peptides in the low-salt buffer are shifted to exponential growth upon addition of twice-concentrated rich media.  If this metabolic lag phase increases in the presence of the antimicrobial peptide, it could be considered a form of transient bacteriostatic activity in category 3, above, although other sources of transient bacteriostatic activity, such as a delay due to the time required for the repair of damaged cell structures such as [[cell walls]] or [[cell membranes]], are possible.

5.  [[Bactericidal]] activity, or killing.  Fewer surviving cells cause a delay in T&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt; as the survivors take longer to produce the same amount of turbidity through exponential growth.  If all other processes causing increases in T&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt; are negligible, the VCC assay becomes a bactericidal assay and T&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt; can be used to enumerate viable bacteria by QGK.  In this simplified case, VCC "virtual survival" results are equivalent to the "survival" results of a traditional colony count bactericidal assay.

==Bacteria==

VCC was initially employed to quantify the antibacterial activity of peptides against six strains of ''[[Escherichia coli]], [[Staphylococcus aureus]], [[Bacillus cereus]], and [[Enterobacter aerogenes]]''.&lt;ref name="pmid15616305"/&gt;  Commonly, a standard [[Gram-negative]] and [[Gram-positive]] [[quality control]] strain are compared.  ''Escherichia coli'' [[American Type Culture Collection|ATCC]] 25922 and ''Staphylococcus aureus'' ATCC 29213 have been used as the standard Gram-negative and Gram-positive strains, respectively.  VCC has also been applied to ''[[Bacillus anthracis]]'', the causative agent of [[anthrax]].&lt;ref name="pmid21768520"&gt;{{Cite journal|vauthors=Welkos S, Cote CK, Hahn U, Shastak O, Jedermann J, Bozue J, Jung G, Ruchala P, Pratikhya P, Tang T, Lehrer RI, Beyer W |title=Humanized theta-defensins (retrocyclins) enhance macrophage performance and protect mice from experimental anthrax infections. |journal= Antimicrob.

==Antimicrobial peptides==

The initial virtual colony count study measured the activity of all six human [[alpha defensins]] concurrently on the same 96-well plate: [[HNP1]], [[HNP2]], [[HNP3]], [[HNP4]], [[DEFA5|HD5]], and [[HD6]].&lt;ref name="pmid15616305"/&gt;  Subsequently, [[mutated]] forms of some of those six defensins were studied by VCC.  A conserved [[glycine]] in a [[beta bulge]] in HNP2 was replaced with a series of [[D-amino acids]] resulting in VCC activity proportional to side chain [[hydrophobicity]] and charge.&lt;ref name="pmid15894545

==Safe and effective pipetting technique==
VCC users are cautioned to transfer cells in a small volume such as 10 microliters beneath a larger volume such as 90 microliters, similar to the QGK calibration curves shown above and the calibration curves reported in the initial VCC publication,&lt;ref name="pmid15616305"/&gt; but unlike the experimental procedure used to test defensin activity in that same paper.  The improved [[pipetting]] technique was described in 2011 in the study of the [[biosafety]] level 3 (BSL-3) [[pathogen]] ''Bacillus anthracis''.&lt;ref name="pmid21768520"/&gt;  The original method published in 2005 involved the transfer of 50 microliters of cell suspensions to 50 microliters of liquid, which generates froth, bubbles and turbidity that is incompatible with a turbidimetric method when cells are transferred directly to the bottoms of the wells beneath the phosphate buffer solutions.  Avoiding this problem by adding cell suspensions as droplets from above can cause [[aerosols]] that result in cross-contamination.&lt;ref name="pmid25671086"&gt;{{Cite journal|vauthors=Ericksen B |title=Safety, efficacy and utility of methods of transferring adhesive and cohesive Escherichia coli cells to microplates to avoid aerosols |journal= F1000Res. |volume=3 |pages= 267 |year= 2014 |pmid= 25671086 |pmc= 4309163 |doi= 10.12688/f1000research.5659.2}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Bioaerosols]] of hazardous bacteria can also pose safety risks that can be reduced by conducting experiments within a [[biosafety cabinet]].

In [[number theory]], a '''Wieferich prime''' is a [[prime number]] ''p'' such that ''p''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; divides {{math|1=2&lt;sup&gt;''p''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1}},&lt;ref name="The Prime Glossary"&gt;{{Citation |url= http://primes.utm.edu/glossary/xpage/WieferichPrime.html |title=The Prime Glossary:  Wieferich prime }}&lt;/ref&gt; therefore connecting these primes with [[Fermat's little theorem]], which states that every odd prime ''p'' divides {{math|1=2&lt;sup&gt;''p''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1}}. Wieferich primes were first described by [[Arthur Wieferich]] in 1909 in works pertaining to [[Fermat's last theorem]], at which time both of Fermat's theorems were already well known to mathematicians.&lt;ref name=Kleiner&gt;{{Citation |author=Israel Kleiner |title= From Fermat to Wiles: Fermat's Last Theorem Becomes a Theorem |journal= Elemente der Mathematik |volume=55 |year=2000 |page=21 |url= http://math.stanford.edu/~lekheng/flt/kleiner.pdf |doi= 10.1007/PL00000079 |postscript=. |archiveurl= https://www.webcitation.org/5rBbbEvIz?url=http://math.stanford.edu/%7Elekheng/flt/kleiner.pdf |archive-date= July 13, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Euler&gt;{{Citation |author= Leonhard Euler |title= Theorematum quorundam ad numeros primos spectantium demonstratio |journal= Novi Comm.

Since then, connections between Wieferich primes and various other topics in mathematics have been discovered, including other types of numbers and primes, such as [[Mersenne number|Mersenne]] and [[Fermat number|Fermat]] numbers, specific types of [[pseudoprime]]s and some types of numbers generalized from the original definition of a Wieferich prime. Over time, those connections discovered have extended to cover more properties of certain prime numbers as well as more general subjects such as [[number field]]s and the [[abc conjecture]].

{{Asof|2018|09}}, the only known Wieferich primes are 1093 and 3511 {{OEIS|id=A001220}}.

== Equivalent definitions ==

The stronger version of [[Fermat's little theorem]], which a Wieferich prime satisfies, is usually expressed as a [[congruence relation]] {{math|2&lt;sup&gt;''p'' -1&lt;/sup&gt; &amp;equiv; 1 (mod ''p''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)}}. From the definition of the [[Modular arithmetic#Congruence relation|congruence relation on integers]], it follows that this property is equivalent to the definition given at the beginning. Thus if a prime ''p'' satisfies this congruence, this prime divides the [[Fermat quotient]] &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{2^{p-1}-1}{p}&lt;/math&gt;. The following are two illustrative examples using the primes 11 and 1093:
: For ''p'' = 11, we get &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{2^{10}-1}{11}&lt;/math&gt; which is 93 and leaves a [[remainder]] of 5 after division by 11, hence 11 is not a Wieferich prime. For ''p'' = 1093, we get &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{2^{1092}-1}{1093}&lt;/math&gt; or 485439490310...852893958515 (302 intermediate digits omitted for clarity), which leaves a remainder of 0 after division by 1093 and thus 1093 is a Wieferich prime.

Wieferich primes can be defined by other equivalent congruences. If ''p'' is a Wieferich prime, one can multiply both sides of the congruence {{math|1=2&lt;sup&gt;''p''−1&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;≡&amp;nbsp;1&amp;nbsp;(mod&amp;nbsp;''p''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)}} by 2 to get {{math|1=2&lt;sup&gt;''p''&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;≡&amp;nbsp;2&amp;nbsp;(mod&amp;nbsp;''p''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)}}. Raising both sides of the congruence to the power ''p'' shows that a Wieferich prime also satisfies {{math|1=2&lt;sup&gt;''p''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;≡2&lt;sup&gt;''p''&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;≡&amp;nbsp;2&amp;nbsp;(mod&amp;nbsp;''p''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)}}, and hence {{math|1=2&lt;sup&gt;''p''&lt;sup&gt;k&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;≡&amp;nbsp;2&amp;nbsp;(mod&amp;nbsp;''p''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)}} for all {{math|1=''k''&amp;nbsp;≥&amp;nbsp;1}}. The converse is also true: {{math|1=2&lt;sup&gt;''p''&lt;sup&gt;k&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;≡&amp;nbsp;2&amp;nbsp;(mod&amp;nbsp;''p''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)}} for some {{math|1=''k''&amp;nbsp;≥&amp;nbsp;1}} implies that the [[multiplicative order]] of 2 modulo ''p''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; divides [[Greatest common divisor|gcd]]{{math|1=(''p''&lt;sup&gt;k&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1}}, [[Euler's totient function|φ]]{{math|1=(''p''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;))&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''p''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1}}, that is, {{math|1=2&lt;sup&gt;''p''−1&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;≡&amp;nbsp;1&amp;nbsp;(mod&amp;nbsp;''p''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)}} and thus ''p'' is a Wieferich prime. This also implies that Wieferich primes can be defined as primes ''p'' such that the multiplicative orders of 2 modulo ''p'' and modulo ''p''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; coincide: {{math|1=ord&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sub&gt; 2 = ord&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt; 2}}, (By the way, ord&lt;sub&gt;1093&lt;/sub&gt;2 = 364, and ord&lt;sub&gt;3511&lt;/sub&gt;2 = 1755).

[[Harry Vandiver|H. S. Vandiver]] proved that {{math|1=2&lt;sup&gt;''p''−1&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;≡&amp;nbsp;1&amp;nbsp;(mod&amp;nbsp;''p''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;)}} if and only if &lt;math&gt;1 + \tfrac{1}{3} + \dots + \tfrac{1}{p-2} \equiv 0 \pmod{p^2}&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | first=L.

== History and search status ==

In 1902, W. F. Meyer proved a theorem about solutions of the congruence ''a''&lt;sup&gt;''p'' − 1&lt;/sup&gt; ≡ 1 (mod ''p''&lt;sup&gt;''r''&lt;/sup&gt;).&lt;ref name=Solutions&gt;{{Citation |author=Wilfrid Keller; Jörg Richstein |title=Solutions of the congruence {{math|1=''a''&lt;sup&gt;''p''−1&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;≡&amp;nbsp;1&amp;nbsp;(mod&amp;nbsp;''p''&lt;sup&gt;''r''&lt;/sup&gt;)}} |journal=Mathematics of Computation |volume=74 |year=2005 |pages=927–936 |doi=10.1090/S0025-5718-04-01666-7 |url=http://www.ams.org/journals/mcom/2005-74-250/S0025-5718-04-01666-7/S0025-5718-04-01666-7.pdf |postscript=. |issue=250}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|930}} Later in that decade [[Arthur Wieferich]] showed specifically that if the [[first case of Fermat's last theorem]] has solutions for an odd prime exponent, then that prime must satisfy that congruence for ''a'' = 2 and ''r'' = 2. In other words, if there exist solutions to ''x''&lt;sup&gt;''p''&lt;/sup&gt; + ''y''&lt;sup&gt;''p''&lt;/sup&gt; + ''z''&lt;sup&gt;''p''&lt;/sup&gt; = 0 in integers ''x'', ''y'', ''z'' and ''p'' an [[odd prime]] with ''p'' [[List of mathematical symbols#notdivide|∤]] ''xyz'', then ''p'' satisfies 2&lt;sup&gt;''p'' − 1&lt;/sup&gt; ≡ 1 (mod ''p''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;). In 1913, [[Paul Gustav Heinrich Bachmann|Bachmann]] examined the [[Remainder|residues]] of &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{2^{p-1}-1}{p}\,\bmod\,p&lt;/math&gt;. He asked the question when this residue [[Zero of a function|vanishes]] and tried to find expressions for answering this question.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Bachmann | first = P. | title = Über den Rest von &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{2^{p-1}-1}{p}\,\bmod\,p&lt;/math&gt; | journal = Journal für Mathematik | volume = 142 | issue = 1 | pages = 41–50 | language=German | year = 1913 | url = http://resolver.sub.uni-goettingen.de/purl?GDZPPN002167646}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The prime 1093 was found to be a Wieferich prime by Waldemar Meissner in 1913 and confirmed to be the only such prime below 2000.

=== Connection with Fermat's last theorem ===

The following theorem connecting Wieferich primes and [[Fermat's last theorem]] was proven by Wieferich in 1909:&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first=A. |last=Wieferich | authorlink=Arthur Wieferich | title=Zum letzten Fermat'schen Theorem | journal=[[Journal für die reine und angewandte Mathematik]] | volume=136 | year=1909 | language=German | pages=293–302 |url=http://gdz.sub.uni-goettingen.de/dms/resolveppn/?PPN=GDZPPN002166968 | doi=10.1515/crll.1909.136.293 | issue=136 | postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:Let ''p'' be prime, and let ''x'', ''y'', ''z'' be [[integer]]s such that {{math|1=''x''&lt;sup&gt;''p''&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''y''&lt;sup&gt;''p''&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''z''&lt;sup&gt;''p''&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0}}. Furthermore, assume that ''p'' does not divide the [[product (mathematics)|product]]&amp;nbsp;''xyz''. Then ''p'' is a Wieferich prime.

The above case (where ''p'' does not divide any of ''x'', ''y'' or ''z'') is commonly known as the [[first case of Fermat's last theorem]] (FLTI)&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last=Coppersmith | first=D. | authorlink=Don Coppersmith | title=Fermat's Last Theorem (Case I) and the Wieferich Criterion | journal=Mathematics of Computation  | volume=54 | issue=190  | pages=895–902 | year=1990  | jstor=2008518 |url=http://www.ams.org/journals/mcom/1990-54-190/S0025-5718-1990-1010598-2/S0025-5718-1990-1010598-2.pdf | postscript=. | doi=10.1090/s0025-5718-1990-1010598-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last=Cikánek | first=P. | title=A Special Extension of Wieferich's Criterion  | journal=Mathematics of Computation  | volume=62  | issue=206 | pages=923–930 | jstor=3562296 | year=1994 | url=http://www.ams.org/journals/mcom/1994-62-206/S0025-5718-1994-1216257-9/S0025-5718-1994-1216257-9.pdf | postscript=. | doi=10.2307/2153550}}&lt;/ref&gt; and FLTI is said to fail for a prime ''p'', if solutions to the Fermat equation exist for that ''p'', otherwise FLTI holds for ''p''.&lt;ref name="Dilcher, Skula"&gt;{{Citation | last1=Dilcher | first1=K. | last2=Skula | first2=L. | title=A new criterion for the first case of Fermat's last theorem | journal=Mathematics of Computation | volume=64 | issue=209 | pages=363–392 | jstor=2153341 | year=1995 | url=http://www.ams.org/journals/mcom/1995-64-209/S0025-5718-1995-1248969-6/S0025-5718-1995-1248969-6.pdf | doi=10.1090/s0025-5718-1995-1248969-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''K'' = '''Q'''(''ξ'') is the [[field extension]] obtained by adjoining all [[polynomial]]s in the [[algebraic number]] ''&amp;xi;'' to the [[Field (mathematics)|field]] of [[rational number]]s (such an extension is known as a [[Algebraic number field|number field]] or in this particular case, where ''&amp;xi;'' is a [[root of unity]], a [[cyclotomic field|cyclotomic number field]]).&lt;ref name="Granville, Monagan" /&gt;{{rp|332}} 
From [[Fundamental theorem of ideal theory in number fields|uniqueness of factorization of ideals in '''Q'''(ξ)]] it follows that if the first case of Fermat's last theorem has solutions ''x'', ''y'', ''z'' then ''p'' divides ''x''+''y''+''z'' and (''x'', ''y''), (''y'', ''z'') and (''z'', ''x'') are elements of ''H&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;''.&lt;ref name="Granville, Monagan" /&gt;{{rp|333}}

=== Connection with the ''abc'' conjecture and non-Wieferich primes ===

A non-Wieferich prime is a prime ''p'' satisfying {{math|1=2&lt;sup&gt;''p''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;≢&amp;nbsp;1&amp;nbsp;(mod&amp;nbsp;''p''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)}}. [[Joseph H. Silverman|J. H. Silverman]] showed in 1988 that if the [[abc conjecture]] holds, then there exist infinitely many non-Wieferich primes.&lt;ref&gt;Charles, D. X. [http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~cdx/Criterion.pdf On Wieferich primes]&lt;/ref&gt; More precisely he showed that the abc conjecture implies the existence of a constant only depending on ''α'' such that the number of non-Wieferich primes to base ''α'' with ''p'' less than or equal to a variable ''X'' is greater than log(''X'') as ''X'' goes to infinity.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | first=J.

It was later shown that the existence of infinitely many non-Wieferich primes already follows from a weaker version of the abc conjecture, called the ''ABC''-(''k'', ''ε'') ''conjecture''.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | first=K. | last=Broughan | title=Relaxations of the ABC Conjecture using integer ''k''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;th roots | journal=New Zealand J.

=== Connection with Mersenne and Fermat primes ===

It is known that the ''n''th [[Mersenne number]] {{math|1=''M''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;2&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1}} is prime only if ''n'' is prime. [[Fermat's little theorem]] implies that if {{math|1=''p''&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;2}} is prime, then ''M''&lt;sub&gt;''p''−1&lt;/sub&gt; {{math|1=(=&amp;nbsp;2&lt;sup&gt;''p''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1)}} is always divisible by ''p''. Since Mersenne numbers of prime indices  ''M''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt; and ''M''&lt;sub&gt;''q''&lt;/sub&gt; are co-prime,
::A prime divisor ''p'' of ''M''&lt;sub&gt;''q''&lt;/sub&gt;, where ''q'' is prime, is a Wieferich prime if and only if ''p''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; divides ''M''&lt;sub&gt;''q''&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |url=http://primes.utm.edu/mersenne/index.html#unknown |title=Mersenne Primes: Conjectures and Unsolved Problems }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Thus, a Mersenne prime cannot also be a Wieferich prime. A notable [[Unsolved problems in mathematics|open problem]] is to determine whether or not all Mersenne numbers of prime index are [[Square-free integer|square-free]]. If ''q'' is prime and the Mersenne number ''M''&lt;sub&gt;''q''&lt;/sub&gt; is ''not'' square-free, that is, there exists a prime ''p'' for which ''p''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; divides ''M''&lt;sub&gt;''q''&lt;/sub&gt;, then ''p'' is a Wieferich prime. Therefore, if there are only finitely many Wieferich primes, then there will be at most finitely many Mersenne numbers with prime index that are not square-free. Rotkiewicz showed a related result: if there are infinitely many square-free Mersenne numbers, then there are infinitely many non-Wieferich primes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Rotkiewicz | first = A. | title = Sur les nombres de Mersenne dépourvus de diviseurs carrés et sur les nombres naturels n, tels que {{math|1=''n''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;#x2223;2&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;2}} | journal = Mat.

Similarly, if ''p'' is prime and ''p''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; divides some [[Fermat number]] ''F''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; {{math|1==&amp;nbsp;2&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1}}, then ''p'' must be a Wieferich prime.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |authorlink=Paulo Ribenboim |last=Ribenboim |first=Paulo |title=The little book of big primes |place=New York |publisher=Springer |year=1991 |page=64 |isbn=978-0-387-97508-5 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=zUCK7FT4xgAC&amp;pg=PA64 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In fact, there exists a natural number ''n'' and a prime ''p'' that ''p''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; divides &lt;math&gt;\Phi_n(2)&lt;/math&gt; (where &lt;math&gt;\Phi_n(x)&lt;/math&gt; is the ''n''-th [[cyclotomic polynomial]]) [[if and only if]] ''p'' is a Wieferich prime. For example, 1093&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; divides &lt;math&gt;\Phi_{364}(2)&lt;/math&gt;, 3511&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; divides &lt;math&gt;\Phi_{1755}(2)&lt;/math&gt;. Mersenne and Fermat numbers are just special situations of &lt;math&gt;\Phi_n(2)&lt;/math&gt;. Thus, if 1093 and 3511 are only two Wieferich primes, then all &lt;math&gt;\Phi_n(2)&lt;/math&gt; are [[square-free number|square-free]] except &lt;math&gt;\Phi_{364}(2)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\Phi_{1755}(2)&lt;/math&gt; (In fact, when there exists a prime ''p'' which ''p''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; divides some &lt;math&gt;\Phi_n(2)&lt;/math&gt;, then it is a Wieferich prime); and clearly, if &lt;math&gt;\Phi_n(2)&lt;/math&gt; is a prime, then it cannot be Wieferich prime. (Notice any odd prime ''p'' divides only one &lt;math&gt;\Phi_n(2)&lt;/math&gt; and ''n'' divides {{math|1=''p''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1}}, and if and only if the period length of 1/p in [[Binary number|binary]] is ''n'', then ''p'' divides &lt;math&gt;\Phi_n(2)&lt;/math&gt;. Besides, if and only if ''p'' is a Wieferich prime, then the period length of 1/p and 1/p&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; are the same (in binary). Otherwise, this is ''p'' times than that.)

=== Abundancy of ''p'' − 1 ===

It has been noted {{OEIS|id=A239875}} that the known Wieferich primes are one greater than mutually [[friendly number]]s (the shared abundancy index being 112/39).

=== Connection with pseudoprimes ===

It was observed that the two known Wieferich primes are the square factors of all [[Square-free integer|non-square free]] base-2 [[Fermat pseudoprime]]s up to 25{{e|9}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | author1-link=Paulo Ribenboim | last1=Ribenboim | first1=P. | title=The Little Book of Bigger Primes | location=New York | publisher=Springer-Verlag | year=2004 | isbn=978-0-387-20169-6 | page=99 |chapter-url=http://trex58.files.wordpress.com/2010/01/ribenboimbook1.pdf |chapter=Chapter 2.

If &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{2^{n-1}-1}{n}\not\equiv 0 \pmod{p}&lt;/math&gt;, then also &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{2^{p-1}-1}{p}\not\equiv 0 \pmod{p}&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name="Dilcher, Skula"/&gt;{{rp|378}} Furthermore, if ''p'' is a Wieferich prime, then ''p''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; is a [[Catalan pseudoprime]].

=== Connection with directed graphs ===

For all primes {{math|''p''}} up to {{math|1=100000}}, {{math|1=''L''(''p''&lt;sup&gt;''n''+1&lt;/sup&gt;) = ''L''(''p''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;)}} only in two cases: {{math|1=''L''(1093&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) = ''L''(1093) = 364}} and {{math|1=''L''(3511&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) = ''L''(3511) = 1755}}, where {{math|1=''L''(''m'')}} is the number of vertices in the cycle of 1  in the ''doubling diagram'' modulo {{math|''m''}}.

=== Properties related to number fields ===

It was shown that &lt;math&gt;\chi_{D_{0}} \big(p \big) = 1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\lambda\,\!_p \big( \mathbb{Q} \big(\sqrt{D_{0}} \big) \big) = 1&lt;/math&gt; if and only if {{math|1=2&lt;sup&gt;''p''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;≢&amp;nbsp;1&amp;nbsp;(mod&amp;nbsp;''p''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)}} where ''p'' is an odd prime and &lt;math&gt;D_{0} &lt; 0&lt;/math&gt; is the [[fundamental discriminant]] of the imaginary [[quadratic field]] &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Q} \big(\sqrt{1 - p^2} \big)&lt;/math&gt;. Furthermore, the following was shown: Let ''p'' be a Wieferich prime. If {{math|''p'' ≡ 3 (mod 4)}}, let &lt;math&gt;D_{0} &lt; 0&lt;/math&gt; be the fundamental discriminant of the imaginary quadratic field &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Q} \big(\sqrt{1 - p} \big)&lt;/math&gt; and if {{math|''p'' ≡ 1 (mod 4)}}, let &lt;math&gt;D_{0} &lt; 0&lt;/math&gt; be the fundamental discriminant of the imaginary quadratic field &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Q} \big(\sqrt{4 - p} \big)&lt;/math&gt;. Then &lt;math&gt;\chi_{D_{0}} \big(p \big) = 1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\lambda\,\!_p \big( \mathbb{Q} \big(\sqrt{D_{0}} \big) \big) = 1&lt;/math&gt; (''χ'' and ''λ'' in this context denote Iwasawa [[Invariant (mathematics)|invariants]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | first=D. | last=Byeon | title=Class numbers, Iwasawa invariants and modular forms | journal=Trends in Mathematics | volume=9 | issue=1 | year=2006 | pages=25–29 | url=http://basilo.kaist.ac.kr/mathnet/kms_tex/985999.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|27}}

The sign +1 or -1 above can be easily predicted by [[Euler's criterion]] (and the second supplement to the law of [[quadratic reciprocity]]).

Dorais and Klyve&lt;ref name=Dorais/&gt; used a different definition of a near-Wieferich prime, defining it as a prime ''p'' with small value of &lt;math&gt;\left|\tfrac{\omega(p)}{p}\right|&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;\omega(p)=\tfrac{2^{p-1}-1}{p}\,\bmod\,p&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Fermat quotient]] of 2 with respect to ''p'' modulo ''p'' (the [[modulo operation]] here gives the residue with the smallest absolute value).

The two notions of nearness are related as follows. If &lt;math&gt;2^{(p-1)/2}\equiv \pm 1 + Ap \pmod{p^2}&lt;/math&gt;, then by squaring, clearly &lt;math&gt;2^{p-1}\equiv 1 \pm 2Ap \pmod{p^2}&lt;/math&gt;. So if {{mvar|A}} had been chosen with &lt;math&gt;|A|&lt;/math&gt; small, then clearly &lt;math&gt;|\pm 2A|=2|A|&lt;/math&gt; is also (quite) small, and an even number. However, when &lt;math&gt;\omega(p)&lt;/math&gt; is odd above, the related {{mvar|A}} from before the last squaring was not "small". For example, with &lt;math&gt;p=3167939147662997&lt;/math&gt;, we have &lt;math&gt;2^{(p-1)/2}\equiv -1 - 1583969573831490p \pmod{p^2}&lt;/math&gt; which reads extremely non-near, but after squaring this is &lt;math&gt;2^{p-1}\equiv 1 - 17p \pmod{p^2}&lt;/math&gt; which is a near-Wieferich by the second definition.

===Base-''a'' Wieferich primes===
{{Main article|Fermat quotient#Generalized Wieferich primes|l1=Fermat quotient}}
A ''Wieferich prime base a'' is a prime ''p'' that satisfies
: {{math|1=''a''&lt;sup&gt;''p''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;≡&amp;nbsp;1&amp;nbsp;(mod&amp;nbsp;''p''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)}}.&lt;ref name="Solutions"/&gt;
Such a prime cannot divide ''a'', since then it would also divide 1.

It's a conjecture that for every natural number ''a'', there are infinitely many Wieferich primes in base ''a''.

Bolyai showed that if ''p'' and ''q'' are primes, ''a'' is a positive integer not divisible by ''p'' and ''q'' such that {{math|''a''&lt;sup&gt;''p''−1&lt;/sup&gt; ≡ 1 (mod ''q'')}}, {{math|''a''&lt;sup&gt;''q''−1&lt;/sup&gt; ≡ 1 (mod ''p'')}}, then {{math|''a''&lt;sup&gt;''pq''−1&lt;/sup&gt; ≡ 1 (mod ''pq'')}}. Setting ''p'' = ''q'' leads to {{math|''a''&lt;sup&gt;''p''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; ≡ 1 (mod ''p''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)}}.&lt;ref name="Kiss"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Kiss | first = E. |author2=Sándor, J. | title = On a congruence by János Bolyai, connected with pseudoprimes | journal = Mathematica Pannonica | volume = 15 | issue = 2 | pages = 283–288 | year = 2004 | url = http://ttk.pte.hu/mii/html/pannonica/index_elemei/mp15-2/mp15-2-283-288.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|284}} It was shown that {{math|''a''&lt;sup&gt;''p''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; ≡ 1 (mod ''p''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)}} if and only if {{math|''a''&lt;sup&gt;''p''−1&lt;/sup&gt; ≡ 1 (mod ''p''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)}}.&lt;ref name="Kiss" /&gt;{{rp|285–286}}

===Wieferich pairs===
{{main article|Wieferich pair}}
A [[Wieferich pair]] is a pair of primes ''p'' and ''q'' that satisfy
: ''p''&lt;sup&gt;''q'' − 1&lt;/sup&gt; ≡ 1 (mod ''q''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) and ''q''&lt;sup&gt;''p'' − 1&lt;/sup&gt; ≡ 1 (mod ''p''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)
so that a Wieferich prime ''p'' ≡ 1 (mod 4) will form such a pair (''p'', 2): the only known instance in this case is {{math|1=''p''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1093}}. There are only 7 known Wieferich pairs.&lt;ref&gt;{{mathworld |urlname=DoubleWieferichPrimePair |title=Double Wieferich Prime Pair}}&lt;/ref&gt;

: (2, 1093), (3, 1006003), (5, 1645333507), (5, 188748146801), (83, 4871), (911, 318917), and (2903, 18787) (sequence {{OEIS2C|id=A282293}} in [[On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences|OEIS]])

===Wieferich sequence===

Start with a(1) any natural number (&gt;1), a(''n'') = the smallest prime ''p'' such that (a(''n'' − 1))&lt;sup&gt;''p'' − 1&lt;/sup&gt; = 1 (mod ''p''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) but ''p''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; does not divide a(''n'' − 1) − 1 or a(''n'' − 1) + 1. (If ''p''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; divides a(''n'' − 1) − 1 or a(''n'' − 1) + 1, then the solution is a [[Triviality (mathematics)|trivial solution]]) It is a conjecture that every natural number ''k'' = a(1) &gt; 1 makes this sequence become periodic, for example, let a(1) = 2:

:2, 1093, 5, 20771, 18043, 5, 20771, 18043, 5, ..., it gets a cycle: {5, 20771, 18043}.

Let a(1) = 83:

:83, 4871, 83, 4871, 83, 4871, 83, ..., it gets a cycle: {83, 4871}.

Let a(1) = 59 (a longer sequence):

:59, 2777, 133287067, 13, 863, 7, 5, 20771, 18043, 5, ..., it also gets 5.

However, there are many values of a(1) with unknown status, for example, let a(1) = 3:

:3, 11, 71, 47, ? (There are no known Wieferich primes in base 47).

Let a(1) = 14:

:14, 29, ? (There are no known Wieferich prime in base 29 except 2, but 2&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 4 divides 29 − 1 = 28)

Let a(1) = 39 (a longer sequence):
:39, 8039, 617, 101, 1050139, 29, ? (It also gets 29)

It is unknown that values for a(1) &gt; 1 exist such that the resulting sequence does not eventually become periodic.

When a(''n'' − 1)=''k'', a(''n'') will be (start with ''k'' = 2): 1093, 11, 1093, 20771, 66161, 5, 1093, 11, 487, 71, 2693, 863, 29, 29131, 1093, 46021, 5, 7, 281, ?, 13, 13, 25633, 20771, 71, 11, 19, ?, 7, 7, 5, 233, 46145917691, 1613, 66161, 77867, 17, 8039, 11, 29, 23, 5, 229, 1283, 829, ?, 257, 491531, ?, ... (For ''k'' = 21, 29, 47, 50, even the next value is unknown)

===Wieferich numbers===
A '''Wieferich number''' is an odd natural number ''n'' satisfying the congruence 2&lt;sup&gt;{{φ}}(''n'')&lt;/sup&gt; ≡ 1 (mod ''n''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;), where {{φ}} denotes the [[Euler's totient function]] (according to [[Euler's theorem]], 2&lt;sup&gt;{{φ}}(''n'')&lt;/sup&gt; ≡ 1 (mod ''n'') for every odd natural number ''n''). If Wieferich number ''n'' is prime, then it is a Wieferich prime. The first few Wieferich numbers are:
:1, 1093, 3279, 3511, 7651, 10533, 14209, 17555, 22953, 31599, 42627, 45643, 52665, 68859, 94797, 99463, … {{OEIS|A077816}}
It can be shown that if there are only finitely many Wieferich primes, then there are only finitely many Wieferich numbers. In particular, if the only Wieferich primes are 1093 and 3511, then there exist exactly 104 Wieferich numbers, which matches the number of Wieferich numbers currently known.&lt;ref name="Banks, Luca"/&gt;

More generally, a natural number ''n'' is a '''Wieferich number to base''' ''a'', if ''a''&lt;sup&gt;{{φ}}(''n'')&lt;/sup&gt; ≡ 1 (mod ''n''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;).&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | first1=T. | last1=Agoh | first2=K. | last2=Dilcher | first3=L. | last3=Skula | title=Fermat Quotients for Composite Moduli | journal=Journal of Number Theory | volume=66 | issue=1 | year=1997 | pages=29–50 | doi=10.1006/jnth.1997.2162}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|31}}

Another definition specifies a '''Wieferich number''' as odd natural number ''n'' such that ''n'' and &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{2^m-1}{n}&lt;/math&gt; are not [[coprime]], where ''m'' is the [[multiplicative order]] of 2 modulo ''n''. The first of these numbers are:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Müller | first = H. | journal = Mitteilungen der Mathematischen Gesellschaft in Hamburg | volume = 28 | pages = 121–130 | year = 2009 | language = German | title = Über Periodenlängen und die Vermutungen von Collatz und Crandall | url = https://books.google.com/?id=hgYTAQAAMAAJ&amp;dq=wieferich+21%2C+39%2C+55%2C+57%2C+105%2C+111%2C+147%2C+155%2C+165%2C+171%2C+183&amp;q=21%2C+39%2C+55%2C+57%2C+105%2C+111%2C+147%2C+155%2C+165%2C+171%2C+183#search_anchor}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:21, 39, 55, 57, 105, 111, 147, 155, 165, 171, 183, 195, 201, 203, 205, 219, 231, 237, 253, 273, 285, 291, 301, 305, 309, 327, 333, 355, 357, 385, 399, … {{OEIS|A182297}}
As above, if Wieferich number ''q'' is prime, then it is a Wieferich prime.

=== Weak Wieferich prime ===
A weak Wieferich prime to base ''a'' is a prime ''p'' satisfies the condition
:''a''&lt;sup&gt;''p''&lt;/sup&gt; ≡ ''a'' (mod ''p''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)

Every Wieferich prime to base ''a'' is also a weak Wieferich prime to base ''a''. If the base ''a'' is [[squarefree number|squarefree]], then a prime ''p'' is a weak Wieferich prime to base ''a'' if and only if ''p'' is a Wieferich prime to base ''a''.

Smallest weak Wieferich prime to base ''n'' are (start with ''n'' = 0)
:2, 2, 1093, 11, 2, 2, 66161, 5, 2, 2, 3, 71, 2, 2, 29, 29131, 2, 2, 3, 3, 2, 2, 13, 13, 2, 2, 3, 3, 2, 2, 7, 7, 2, 2, 46145917691, 3, 2, 2, 17, 8039, 2, 2, 23, 5, 2, 2, 3, ...

=== Wieferich prime with order ''n'' ===
For integer ''n'' ≥2, a Wieferich prime to base ''a'' with order ''n'' is a prime ''p'' satisfies the condition
:''a''&lt;sup&gt;''p''−1&lt;/sup&gt; ≡ 1 (mod ''p''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;)

Clearly, a Wieferich prime to base ''a'' with order ''n'' is also a Wieferich prime to base ''a'' with order ''m'' for all 2 ≤ ''m'' ≤ ''n'', and Wieferich prime to base ''a'' with order 2 is equivent to Wieferich prime to base ''a'', so we can only consider the ''n'' ≥ 3 case. However, there are no known Wieferich prime to base 2 with order 3. The first base with known Wieferich prime with order 3 is 9, where 2 is a Wieferich prime to base 9 with order 3. Besides, both 5 and 113 are Wieferich prime to base 68 with order 3.

===Lucas–Wieferich primes===
A '''Lucas–Wieferich prime''' associated with the [[Ordered pair|pair]] of integers (''P'', ''Q'') is a prime ''p'' such that ''U''&lt;sub&gt;''p''−''ε''&lt;/sub&gt;(''P'', ''Q'') ≡ 0 (mod ''p''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;), where ''U''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;(''P'', ''Q'') denotes the [[Lucas sequence]] [[Lucas sequence#Recurrence relations|of the first kind]] and ''ε'' equals the [[Legendre symbol]] &lt;math&gt;\left(\tfrac{P^2-4Q}p\right)&lt;/math&gt;. All Wieferich primes are Lucas-Wieferich primes associated with the pair (3, 2).&lt;ref name="McIntosh, 2007" /&gt;{{rp|2088}}

====Fibonacci–Wieferich primes====
Let ''Q'' = −1, ''P'' be any natural number, these primes are called '''''P''-Fibonacci–Wieferich primes''' or '''''P''-[[Wall–Sun–Sun prime]]s''', and if ''P'' = 1, they are called '''Fibonacci-Wieferich primes''', and if ''P'' = 2, they are called '''Pell–Wieferich primes'''. For example, 241 is a Wieferich prime when ''P'' = 3, so it is a 3-Fibonacci-Wieferich prime or 3-Wall–Sun–Sun prime. In fact, 3 is an ''n''-Fibonacci-Wieferich prime if and only if ''n'' congruent to 0, 4, or 5 (mod 9), like the traditional Wieferich primes, 3 is a base ''n'' Wieferich prime if and only if ''n'' congruent to 1 or 8 (mod 9).

===Wieferich places===
Let ''K'' be a [[global field]], i.e. a [[number field]] or a [[Algebraic function field|function field]] in one variable over a [[finite field]] and let ''E'' be an [[elliptic curve]]. If ''v'' is a [[Algebraic number field#Nonarchimedian or ultrametric places|non-archimedean place]] of [[Field norm|norm]] ''q&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;'' of ''K'' and a ∈ K, with ''v''(''a'') = 0 then {{math|1=''v''(a&lt;sup&gt;''q''&lt;sub&gt;''v''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1)}} ≥ 1. ''v'' is called a ''Wieferich place'' for base ''a'', if {{math|1=''v''(a&lt;sup&gt;''q&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1)}} &gt; 1, an ''elliptic Wieferich place'' for base ''P'' ∈ ''E'', if ''N&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;P'' ∈ ''E''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and a ''strong elliptic Wieferich place'' for base ''P'' ∈ ''E'' if ''n&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;P'' ∈ ''E''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, where ''n&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the order of ''P'' modulo ''v'' and ''N&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;'' gives the number of [[rational point]]s (over the [[residue field]] of ''v'') of the reduction of ''E'' at ''v''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = J.
