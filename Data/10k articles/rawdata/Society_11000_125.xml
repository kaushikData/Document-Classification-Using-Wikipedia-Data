The '''2015 Greek football scandal''' emerged on 6 April 2015 when prosecutor Aristidis Korreas' 173-page work was revealed. [[Telephone tapping]] operated by the [[National Intelligence Service (Greece)|National Intelligence Service of Greece]] since 2011 has played a significant role in the case.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://directnews.gr/athletics/60110-olo-to-porisma-tou-eisaggelea-ar-korea-gia-ta-sthmena-sto-podosfairo-protagonistikos-o-rolos-tou-vaggelh-marinakh-eggrafa.html | script-title = el:Πόρισμα εισαγγελέα Αριστείδη Κορρέα για την ύπαρξη εγκληματικής οργάνωσης στο ποδόσφαιρο | page = 12 | language = Greek | publisher = Public Prosecutor's Office of District Court Judges | date = 3 December 2014 | accessdate = 6 April 2015 | title = Archived copy | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150410102133/http://directnews.gr/athletics/60110-olo-to-porisma-tou-eisaggelea-ar-korea-gia-ta-sthmena-sto-podosfairo-protagonistikos-o-rolos-tou-vaggelh-marinakh-eggrafa.html | archive-date = 10 April 2015 | dead-url = yes | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the prosecutor's conclusion, [[Olympiakos F.C.]] owner [[Evangelos Marinakis]] along with [[Hellenic Football Federation|Greek Football Federation]] members Theodoros Kouridis, and Georgios Sarris are suspected of directing a criminal organization since 2011.

Referees, judges, football directors and chairmen are also involved in the scandal. All defendants deny charges. [[Olympiakos F.C.|Olympiakos]] are the champions of the [[Superleague Greece|Greek Superleague]] at the time.

==Prosecutor's conclusion==

===Organization's beginnings===
{{see also|Koriopolis}}

In the summer of 2011, the Greek football was under the storm of [[Koriopolis]] scandal, a massive [[Match fixing|match-fixing]] case with many officials involved, including [[Evangelos Marinakis]], the new owner of [[Olympiacos F.C.|Olympiacos]].

According to the recent prosecutor's conclusion, [[Evangelos Marinakis]], Theodoros Kouridis, Aristidis Stathopoulos, Georgios Sarris and [[Ένωση Ποδοσφαιρικών Σωματείων Ευβοίας|Euboea Football Clubs Association]] president Ioannis Papakonstantinou later met at [[Hilton Athens|Hilton Hotel]] in Athens in December 2011. The decisions that they came up with after their meeting were to support Sarris' candidation for the presidency of the [[Hellenic Football Federation|Greek Football Federation]] in the upcoming election, aiming to control it, and that [[Evangelos Marinakis]] would have a leading role in the organization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://directnews.gr/athletics/60110-olo-to-porisma-tou-eisaggelea-ar-korea-gia-ta-sthmena-sto-podosfairo-protagonistikos-o-rolos-tou-vaggelh-marinakh-eggrafa.html | script-title = el:Πόρισμα εισαγγελέα Αριστείδη Κορρέα για την ύπαρξη εγκληματικής οργάνωσης στο ποδόσφαιρο | page = 160 | language = Greek | publisher = Public Prosecutor's Office of District Court Judges | date = 3 December 2014 | accessdate = 6 April 2015 | title = Archived copy | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150410102133/http://directnews.gr/athletics/60110-olo-to-porisma-tou-eisaggelea-ar-korea-gia-ta-sthmena-sto-podosfairo-protagonistikos-o-rolos-tou-vaggelh-marinakh-eggrafa.html | archive-date = 10 April 2015 | dead-url = yes | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the first actions of the new presidency of HFF was the replacement of the two football prosecutors (Fakos, Antonakakis) with two others (Petropoulos, Karras).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sdna.gr/gr/podosfairo/dikastikes-upotheseis-skandala/arthro/25841/eisaggeleas-gia-tous-eisaggeleis-uparhei/|title=Εισαγγελέας για τους εισαγγελείς υπάρχει;|publisher=|accessdate=23 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The investigation inside the Federation for the [[Koriopolis]] scandal stopped and never resumed ever since.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.contra.gr/Soccer/Hellas/oristhkan-oi-neoi-athlhtikoi-eisaggeleis.1602153.html|title=Ορίστηκαν οι νέοι αθλητικοί εισαγγελείς|date=2 February 2012|work=Contra.gr|accessdate=23 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2012, Kouridis and Stathopoulos following [[Evangelos Marinakis|Marinakis]] orders, secretly met referee [[Petros Konstantineas]], currently a member of the [[Hellenic Parliament]] and a key participant in the fight against football corruption,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.hellenicparliament.gr/en/Vouleftes/Ana-Koinovouleftiki-Omada/?MPId=892c0af0-c4e0-406e-8d1a-a43400eba3cd | script-title=el:Member of Parliament }}&lt;/ref&gt; and demanded from him to favour [[Olympiakos F.C.|Olympiakos]] against [[Skoda Xanthi F.C.|Xanthi]] at their 22 January 2012 clash.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://tvxs.gr/news/ellada/sto-fos-porisma-gia-ta-stimena-sto-elliniko-podosfairo | script-title=el:Πόρισμα εισαγγελέα Αριστείδη Κορρέα για την ύπαρξη εγκληματικής οργάνωσης στο ποδόσφαιρο | page=161 | language = Greek | publisher = Public Prosecutor's Office of District Court Judges | date = 3 December 2014 | accessdate = 6 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Konstantineas refused and [[Olympiakos F.C.|Olympiakos]] were defeated by [[Skoda Xanthi F.C.|Xanthi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.apn.gr/news/sports/xanthi-olympiakos-1-0-videos/ | script-title=el:Scoda Xanthi – Olympiakos 1–0 | date = 22 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; A month later, according to the prosecutor, [[Evangelos Marinakis|Marinakis]] allegedly ordered unknown people to [[Explosive material#Low explosives|bomb]] Konstantineas' bakery, which led to bakery's demolition on 23 February 2012,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.pelopsnews.gr/news.php?id=1160 | script-title=el:Τίναξαν στον αέρα το φούρνο του διαιτητή Π. Κωνσταντινέα στην Καλαμάτα | date = 23 February 2012 | language = greek }}&lt;/ref&gt; an incident that "established [[Olympiakos F.C.|Olympiakos]]' president domination on [[Football in Greece|Greek football]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://tvxs.gr/news/ellada/sto-fos-porisma-gia-ta-stimena-sto-elliniko-podosfairo | script-title=el:Πόρισμα εισαγγελέα Αριστείδη Κορρέα για την ύπαρξη εγκληματικής οργάνωσης στο ποδόσφαιρο | page=162 | language = Greek | publisher = Public Prosecutor's Office of District Court Judges | date = 3 December 2014 | accessdate = 6 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.faz.net/aktuell/sport/fussball/olympiakos-muss-gewinnen-korruption-in-griechenland-13106395.html|title=Olympiakos muss gewinnen: Korruption in Griechenland|author=Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung GmbH|date=20 August 2014|work=FAZ.NET|accessdate=16 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Expanding activity===

[[Evangelos Marinakis|Marinakis]], Kouridis and Sarris used [[prepaid mobile phone]]s owned typically by Chinese and [[Pakistanis|Pakistani]] immigrants so as to communicate avoiding surveillance from the [[National Intelligence Service (Greece)|National Intelligence Service of Greece]], although they were eventually wiretapped nonetheless. The phone [[Evangelos Marinakis|Marinakis]] used was registered to a Pakistani individual named "Fataul Haque", while Sarris' phone was registered to a Chinese one named "Qianqian Zhang".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://tvxs.gr/news/ellada/sto-fos-porisma-gia-ta-stimena-sto-elliniko-podosfairo | script-title=el:Πόρισμα εισαγγελέα Αριστείδη Κορρέα για την ύπαρξη εγκληματικής οργάνωσης στο ποδόσφαιρο | page=94 | language = Greek | publisher = Public Prosecutor's Office of District Court Judges | date = 3 December 2014 | accessdate = 6 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.insideworldfootball.com/world-football/europe/16904-greek-corruption-olympiacos-owner-charged-in-match-fixing-ring-round-up|title=Greek corruption: Olympiacos owner charged in match-fixing ring round-up - Inside World Football|author=Paul Nicholson|publisher=|accessdate=16 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.insideworldfootball.com/matt-scott/16944-matt-scott-greek-football-s-tragedy-is-a-lesson-for-us-all |title=Matt Scott: Greek football's tragedy is a lesson for us all - Inside World Football |author=Paul Nicholson |publisher= |accessdate=16 August 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924035231/http://www.insideworldfootball.com/matt-scott/16944-matt-scott-greek-football-s-tragedy-is-a-lesson-for-us-all |archivedate=24 September 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Korreas' conclusion states that [[Olympiakos F.C.|Olympiakos]] owner's influence expanded to a wider range beyond his own club and that following his interests, various illegallities were committed. Specific referees were ordered so as to favor [[Platanias F.C.]], a club that was under [[Olympiakos F.C.|Olympiakos]]' influence, against [[Panachaiki F.C.]] in a 2012 [[Football League (Greece)|Football League]] play-off match which led to [[Platanias F.C.]] promoting to [[Superleague Greece|Super League]]. He intervened in [[Football League (Greece)|Football League]]'s Disciplinary Committee work in order to evoke favorable decisions for [[Tyrnavos 2005 F.C.]] against [[Niki Volos F.C.|Niki Volou]].&lt;ref name="scribd.com"&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.scribd.com/doc/264541497/3-%CE%A0%CF%8C%CF%81%CE%B9%CF%83%CE%BC%CE%B1-%CE%B5%CE%B9%CF%83%CE%B1%CE%B3%CE%B3%CE%B5%CE%BB%CE%AD%CE%B1-%CE%9A%CE%BF%CF%81%CF%81%CE%AD%CE%B1-%CE%B3%CE%B9%CE%B1-%CF%84%CE%B7%CE%BD-%CE%B5%CE%B3%CE%BA%CE%BB%CE%B7%CE%BC%CE%B1%CF%84%CE%B9%CE%BA%CE%AE-%CE%BF%CF%81%CE%B3%CE%AC%CE%BD%CF%89%CF%83%CE%B7-%CF%83%CF%84%CE%BF-%CF%80%CE%BF%CE%B4%CF%8C%CF%83%CF%86%CE%B1%CE%B9%CF%81%CE%BF | script-title=el:Πόρισμα εισαγγελέα Αριστείδη Κορρέα για την ύπαρξη εγκληματικής οργάνωσης στο ποδόσφαιρο | page=163 | language = Greek | publisher = Public Prosecutor's Office of District Court Judges | date = 3 December 2014 | accessdate = 6 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most important, he managed to influence most of the [[Local football championships of Greece|local Football Clubs Associations]] across Greece as well as most of the [[Superleague Greece|Super League]] clubs, which out of subordination and financial survival reasons agreed and aided [[Evangelos Marinakis|Marinakis]]' right-hand Giorgos Sarris to become elected as the new president of [[Hellenic Football Federation|Greek Football Federation]].&lt;ref name="scribd.com"/&gt;

The prosecutor's conclusion goes on mentioning that [[Superleague Greece|Super League]]'s control was taken using [[Evangelos Marinakis|Marinakis]]' stated power and economic strength.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://descrier.co.uk/sport/fifas-mafia-family-just-got-bigger/ | title=Fifa’s "Mafia family" just got bigger | publisher = Descrier | date = 15 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Olympiakos F.C.|Olympiakos]] even maintains a large roster aiming to loan players to weaker clubs, succeeding in that manner to "preserve their influence along the league". Club's officials have been recorded by the [[National Intelligence Service (Greece)|National Intelligence Service of Greece]] of even demanding and eventually managing to place in [[Panionios F.C.|Panionios]]' manager position [[Dimitrios Eleftheropoulos]], Olympiacos' former goalkeeper, paying half of his contract salary.&lt;ref name="scribd.com"/&gt;

===Expanding violence===
Various acts of violence are also included inside the prosecutor's conclusion against referees (Giorgos Daloukas, Dimitris Kyrkos etc.), journalists and others. In a separate case, launched in July 2011, Marinakis is accused also of instigation and facilitating acts of [[Violence in sports|violence]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.ekathimerini.com/4dcgi/_w_articles_wsite5_1_11/07/2011_397915|title = Vangelis Marinakis in fresh trouble|date = July 11, 2011|accessdate = |website = Ekathimerini|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to telephone recordings, Marinakis, along with the president of [[Second Division (Greece)|second-division]] club [[Ilioupoli F.C.|Ilioupoli]], Giorgos Tsakogiannis, and others, cooperated so that a group of hardcore Olympiakos fans would travel on March 13, 2011 to a [[Third Division (Greece)|third division]] match and provoke [[riots]] to bring about a penalty. The prosecutor’s report says that "Tsakogiannis informed [Ioannis] [[Papadopoulos]] that he had made arrangements and Evangelos Marinakis was aware of the plan for Olympiakos fans to cause riots".&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

In one of the recorded conversations, the ex-board member of Olympiakos [[Emilios Kotsonis]] (currently imprisoned for a case of a ship with two tonnes [[heroin]], which was caught by the Greek authorities with the help of the [[US Drug Enforcement Administration]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/greece/10919089/Greek-Coast-Guard-seize-over-two-tons-of-heroin.html|title=Greek Coast Guard seize over two tons of heroin|author=AP|date=23 June 2014|work=Telegraph.co.uk|accessdate=16 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;) refers to the severe crowd violence during a derby match of Panathinaikos against Olympiakos ([[2011–12 Superleague Greece|2011–12 season]]), for which Panathinaikos was docked three points and punished €212.000 as fine, saying that [[Golden Dawn (political party)|Golden Dawn]] was behind the incident.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sdna.gr/gr/podosfairo/superleague/panathinaikos/arthro/44681/hrusaugites-piso-apo-ta-epeisodia-sto-derbi-aionion/|title=SPORTSDNA - ΠΟΔΟΣΦΑΙΡΟ - Superleague - Παναθηναϊκός - Χρυσαυγίτες πίσω από τα επεισόδια στο ντέρμπι "αιωνίων"|publisher=|accessdate=16 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Consequent state===
Sarris, Kouridis and Stathopoulos along with their colleagues and former referees Briakos and Douros, compiled the referees' charts for the 2011–12 and 2012–13 seasons of Greek Leagues, including referees of their utmost trust, such as Ioannidis, Amparkiolis and Kampaksis, who were used in crucial games in favor of the organization's interests. Among others, they refereed the match of [[Apollon Smyrni F.C.]] against [[Panionios F.C.|Panionios]], being ordered to favour [[Panionios F.C.|Panionios]], as well as the match of [[Levadiakos F.C.]] against [[Panetolikos F.C.]], being ordered to favour Levadiakos.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.scribd.com/doc/264541497/3-%CE%A0%CF%8C%CF%81%CE%B9%CF%83%CE%BC%CE%B1-%CE%B5%CE%B9%CF%83%CE%B1%CE%B3%CE%B3%CE%B5%CE%BB%CE%AD%CE%B1-%CE%9A%CE%BF%CF%81%CF%81%CE%AD%CE%B1-%CE%B3%CE%B9%CE%B1-%CF%84%CE%B7%CE%BD-%CE%B5%CE%B3%CE%BA%CE%BB%CE%B7%CE%BC%CE%B1%CF%84%CE%B9%CE%BA%CE%AE-%CE%BF%CF%81%CE%B3%CE%AC%CE%BD%CF%89%CF%83%CE%B7-%CF%83%CF%84%CE%BF-%CF%80%CE%BF%CE%B4%CF%8C%CF%83%CF%86%CE%B1%CE%B9%CF%81%CE%BF | script-title=el:Πόρισμα εισαγγελέα Αριστείδη Κορρέα για την ύπαρξη εγκληματικής οργάνωσης στο ποδόσφαιρο | page=164 | language = Greek | publisher = Public Prosecutor's Office of District Court Judges | date = 3 December 2014 | accessdate = 6 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Levadiakos' owner Giannis Kompotis, having acquaintances among the organization's circle, regularly benefit from them.

Concluding, the prosecutor points up that [[Evangelos Marinakis|Marinakis]] managed to currently dominate Greek football using his power and subsequent alliances and that furthermore, taking advantage of the situation, [[Olympiakos F.C.|Olympiakos]] have been winning the Greek [[Superleague Greece|Super League]] each season since [[2010–11 Superleague Greece|2011]], an achievement that automatically gives the club the income reward of around €20&amp;nbsp;million per year out of [[UEFA Champions League#Prize money|UEFA's market pool]]&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; resulting from their subsequent participation in the [[UEFA Champions League]] Group Phase.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.sdna.gr/gr/news-in-english/arthro-news-in-english/36504/panathinaikos-and-paok-set-to-sue-olympiakos-to-uefa/ | title=Panathinaikos and PAOK set to sue Olympiakos to UEFA | publisher = sdna.gr | date = 13 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In one of the recorded conversations, the [[UEFA]]'s Deputy General Secretary, [[Theodore Theodoridis]], partner of [[Michel Platini]] and son of vice-president of Olympiakos Savvas Theodoridis, is heard to provide help to Marinakis. Theodoridis is appearing to be the person who is responsible for the good relations between Platini and the various Football Federations ensuring his reelection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.cahiersdufootball.net/article-olympiakos-grosses-combines-relations-troubles-6011 | title=Olympiakos: Grosses Combines et relations troubles | publisher = les cahiers du football | date = 9 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the Greek sports-site ''sdna.gr'' the Greek Federation has copied the code of [[FIFA Ethics Committee]], but removing all the rules referring to punishments of officials, aiming to self-protection. The Federation still refuses to send its articles of association to the [[Greek General Secretary of Sports]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.sdna.gr/podosfairo/peitharxikes-apofaseis/article/123691/epo-colpo-grosso-atimorisias | title=ΕΠΟ: Colpo grosso ατιμωρησίας | publisher = sdna.grl | date = 11 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Other testimonies and statements ==
In 2014, [[Stamatis Vellis]], ex-president of [[Apollon Smyrni]], testified to the district attorney that the fate of his team depended on actions of corrupted members of the [[Hellenic Football Federation]], naming a number of officials currently accused, and for that reason he quit from the presidency of his club and the Greek football.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iapopsi.gr/kataggelies-velli/|title=Καταγγελίες Βελλή!|author=X. M.|work=Η Άποψη|accessdate=23 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2014, [[Olivier Kapo]], a former player of [[Levadiakos F.C.]], confirmed the alleged existence of a criminal organization within the Greek football industry, when he stated in the French press that in Greek football, “everything is corrupted [and] mafia-controlled.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.sofoot.com/olivier-kapo-en-grece-c-est-la-mafia-totale-188629.html|title = Olivier Kapo:" En Grèce, c'est la mafia totale !"|date = September 3, 2014|accessdate = October 31, 2014|website = |publisher = |last = |first = |language = French}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ex-player of Panathinaikos, [[Gordon Schildenfeld]]’s sensational allegations about corruption in Greek football have caused uproar as he claimed: “I wanted to kill some of the refs in Greece. If I killed as many referees as I wanted you wouldn’t have had too many more in the Greek Superleague to officiate.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/sport/football/6663672/Platini-must-fix-Greek-farce.html|title=Platini must fix Greek farce|publisher=|accessdate=23 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 27 May 2015, the President of the [[Thessaly Football Clubs Association|Football Union of Thessaly]], Anastasios Batziakas (head of a Union which appealed the current presidency of the [[Hellenic Football Federation]] due to corruption), testified that his life was threatened by anonymous calls.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.sdna.gr/gr/podosfairo/ellada/article/40079/apeiles-kataggelei-o-proedros-pou-thelei-na-rixei-tin-epo/ | script-title=el:Απειλές καταγγέλει ο πρόεδρος που θέλει να ρίξει την ΕΠΟ» | language = Greek | publisher = sdna.gr | date = 27 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2015, Petros Konstantineas stated that the referees in Greece should be professionals and criticized the situation about [[Hugh Dallas]] for getting paid without having any jurisdiction. He described also the [[Hellenic Football Federation|Football Federation]] as a company who "pop in and out the Greek courts" and that [[Syriza]] "is going to finish the job".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.soccerplus.gr/article/56962-kostantineas-parea-poy-mpainobgainei-stin-eyelpidon-epo|title=Κωσταντινέας: "Παρέα που μπαινοβγαίνει στην Ευελπίδων η ΕΠΟ|author=soccerplus.gr|date=25 August 2015|publisher=|accessdate=25 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 2 March 2016, the owner oF [[PAOK FC]], [[Ivan Savvidis]], criticized the [[Hellenic Football Federation]]'s officials and referees, stating at TV that "he is ashamed to be linked with the Greek football" and asked the resignation of Olympiakos' president, Marinakis, and the Federation's president.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sdna.gr/podosfairo/kypello-elladas/article/174800/xeimaros-o-savvidis-den-tha-katevoyme-stin-athina|title="Χείμαρρος" ο Σαββίδης: "Δεν θα κατέβουμε στην Αθήνα, να παραιτηθεί ο Μαρινάκης"! |author=sdna.gr|date=3 March 2016|publisher=|accessdate=3 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The board of directors of PAOK also asked the resignation of the Federation's president and the expulsion of all the accused persons from the Greek football, such as arbitration with foreign referees from the next season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.contra.gr/Soccer/Hellas/GreekCup/paok/pae-paok-h-omada-den-tha-agwnistei-ston-epanalhptiko-kypelloy.3938069.html|title=Η ομάδα δεν θα αγωνιστεί στον επαναληπτικό Κυπέλλου |author=contra.gr|date=3 March 2016|publisher=|accessdate=3 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 18 March 2016, [[Panathinaikos FC]] President [[Giannis Alafouzos]] sued Mr Marinakis and judges Tziblakis and Poulios for the [[Koriopolis]] case.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sports.in.gr/football/superleague/article/?aid=1500065801 Μήνυση στον Άρειο Πάγο από Αλαφούζο για το «Koriopolis»]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Current judicial status ==

As of June 2015, suspects are being questioned by investigating judge Georgios Andreadis. Andreadis added 10 suspects to the 16 that prosecutor Aristidis Korreas had proposed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.efsyn.gr/arthro/aytoi-einai-oi-26-katigoroymenoi-tis-egklimatikis-organosis | script-title=el:Αυτοί είναι οι 26 κατηγορούμενοι της «εγκληματικής οργάνωσης» | language = Greek | publisher = Efimerida Syntakton | date = 29 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Court council is due to decide who are to put on trial.

[[Evangelos Marinakis]] was questioned on 18 June 2015 and he was released on a €200,000 bail. He is also forced to stop being involved in any football activity, as well as he must report to a police station every 15 days.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www1.skysports.com/football/news/11095/9888897/olymiakos-owner-vangelis-marinakis-banned-from-football-over-corruption-allegations | title=Olympiakos owner Vangelis Marinakis banned from football over corruption allegations | publisher = skysports.com | date = 18 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.eurosport.com/football/owner-of-greek-champions-banned-over-corruption-probe_sto4787854/story.shtml | title=Owner of Greek champions banned over corruption probe | publisher = eurosport.com | date = 18 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Koriopolis progress===
In July 2015, and after the prosecutor's proposal to the penal justice, it was announced that are going to be tried for the [[Koriopolis]]: the players [[Avraam Papadopoulos]], [[Kostas Mendrinos]], the officials Achilleas Beos, Ioannis Kombotis (owner of [[Levadiakos F.C.]]), Dimitris Tzelepis (chairman of [[Panthrakikos F.C.]]), Giorgos Borovilos (president of [[Asteras Tripolis]]), Dimitris Bakos (owner of Asteras Tripolis), Michalis Kountouris (president of amateur [[Olympiacos CFP]] and board member of [[Olympiacos F.C.]]) and many more.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.insideworldfootball.com/world-football/europe/17545-greeks-send-85-to-trial-for-match-fixing-but-olympiakos-boss-clears-first-round|title=Greeks send 85 to trial for match-fixing, but Olympiakos boss clears first round - Inside World Football|author=Paul Nicholson|publisher=|accessdate=16 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gazzetta.gr/football/article/780885/apallagi-marinaki-se-diki-85-atoma|title=Απαλλαγή Μαρινάκη, σε δίκη 85 άτομα|author=Gazzetta team|date=30 July 2015|publisher=|accessdate=16 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 5 Steptember 2015, a new conversation recorded by the [[National Intelligence Service (Greece)|National Intelligence Service]] came in the light, with the ex-board member of Olympiakos [[Emilios Kotsonis]] asking for a meeting from a judge of the case (Giannis Tziblakis) with [[Evangelos Marinakis]], who was finally cleared for Koriopolis. In the case intervened the [[Court of Cassation (Greece)|Court of Cassation]], the supreme court of Greece for civil and criminal law, and the case for Marinakis is going to be examined again.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sdna.gr/podosfairo/dikastikes-apofaseis/article/122000/paremvasi-areioy-pagoy-gia-skandalo-koriopolis|title=Παρέμβαση Αρείου Πάγου για το σκάνδαλο "Koriopolis"!|publisher=|accessdate=23 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Additional suspects ===

Additional suspects include [[Veria F.C.]] Director of Football Giorgos Lanaris and former owner Giorgos Arvanitidis, regarding 6 January 2013 match of [[Olympiakos F.C.]] against Veria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.sdna.gr/gr/news-in-english/arthro-news-in-english/38394/six-veroia-players-accused-of-bribery/ | title=Six Veroia players accused of bribery | publisher = sdna.gr | date = 20 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Veria player [[Nikolaos Georgeas]] and club's manager [[Dimitris Kalaitzidis]] at the time, testified in March 2015 that Lanaris following Arvanitidis orders demanded from Veria players to lose with a 3–0 score, which eventually happened.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.ethnos.gr/ethnosport/article.asp?catid=8356&amp;subid=2&amp;pubid=130058828 | script-title=el:Το δικαστικό... ντέρμπι της Βέροιας κρίνει τη μάχη της παραμονής | language = Greek | publisher = Ethnos Newspaper | date = 10 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2BmIRMIgiI | script-title=el:4η Αγ. ΟΛΥΜΠΙΑΚΟΣ – ΒΕΡΟΙΑ 3–0 | date = 20 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Andreadis, both [[Evangelos Marinakis|Marinakis]] and Arvanitidis had agreed on the match fixing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.sport24.gr/football/omades/Olympiakos/kathgoroumenos-gia-to-olympiakos-veroia-o-marinakhs.3463504.html | script-title=el:Κατηγορούμενος ο Μαρινάκης για το Ολυμπιακός-Βέροια | language = Greek | date = 12 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Guillermo Pérez, football player of Veria at that time, stated also to the prosecutor that the game was fixed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sdna.gr/podosfairo/dikastikes-apofaseis/article/120097/omologia-vomva-gia-olympiakos-veroia-3-0|title=Ομολογία - βόμβα για το Ολυμπιακός-Βέροια 3-0|publisher=|accessdate=23 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Veria was judged as innocent for the suspected fixed match against Olympiakos by the appeal committee of the Football Federation.

[[Atromitos F.C.]] football director Giannis Agkelopoulos along with club's owner Giorgos Spanos were also questioned by Andreadis on the suspicion of manipulating 4 February 2015 match of [[Olympiakos F.C.|Olympiakos]] against [[Atromitos F.C.|Atromitos]], following [[Panathinaikos F.C.]] football director [[Takis Fyssas]] testimony. Fyssas claimed that Atromitos coach at that time, [[Ricardo Sá Pinto]], had shared with him that Agkelopoulos demanded from the coach not to use [[Miguel Sebastián Garcia|Pitu Garcia]], [[Stefano Napoleoni|Napoleoni]], [[Kostas Katsouranis|Katsouranis]] and Kivrakidis for the match in question.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.efsyn.gr/arthro/peraste-kosme | script-title=el:Περάστε κόσμε... | language = Greek | publisher = Efimerida Syntakton | date = 21 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the questioning, Agkelopoulos and Spanos handed over a letter written by [[Ricardo Sa Pinto|Sa Pinto]] claiming that the story is not true,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.newsit.gr/default.php?pname=Article&amp;art_id=391486&amp;catid=1 | script-title=el:Δήλωσε άγνοια για τις... παρεμβάσεις ο Σα Πίντο | language = Greek | date = 20 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; while [[Takis Fyssas|Fyssas]] claims the story is known even by [[Fernando Santos (football coach)|Fernando Santos]]' assistant, Ricardo Santos. Santos confirmed him after talking to the Press, stating that he had informed Fyssas through a text message which then became part of the latter's testimony.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.zougla.gr/sports/article/fisas-skopos-mou-itan-mono-na-metafero-tin-ali8ia | script-title=el:Φύσσας: «Σκοπός μου ήταν μόνο να μεταφέρω την αλήθεια» | language = Greek | date = 6 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.sdna.gr/gr/podosfairo/arthro/35156/rikardo-o-fussas-de-leei-psemata/ | script-title=el:Ρικάρντο: «Ο Φύσσας δεν λέει ψέματα!» | language = Greek | date = 7 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== UEFA's reaction ===
On June 30, 2015, UEFA's General secretary [[Gianni Infantino]] stated that Olympiakos will keep their spot in the Champions League for the time,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.themalaymailonline.com/sports/article/olympiakos-champions-league-spot-safe-for-now-despite-owners-crime-scandal | title=Olympiakos' Champions League spot safe for now despite owner's crime scandal | date = 30 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; such as Asteras Tripoli FC. Later, the [[Court of Arbitration for Sport]] confirmed the participation of Olympiakos in the Champions League.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.insideworldfootball.com/world-football/europe/17727-match-fixing-who-cares-cas-backs-uefa-over-olympiacos-despite-athens-court-bans | title=
Match-fixing? Who cares? | date = 26 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 17 June 2015, the English sports-site [http://www.insideworldfootball.com Inside World Football] had revealed that UEFA's integrity officer for the [[Hellenic Football Federation|HFF]] (Dimitris Davakis) didn't state to the UEFA's Ethics and Disciplinary Inspector, [[Miguel Liétard Fernandez-Palacios]], the judicial process and the alleged involvement of [[Asteras Tripoli]] in the Greek match-fixing scandal of [[Koriopolis]], regarding their participation in the [[UEFA Europa League]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.insideworldfootball.com/world-football/europe/17247-exclusive-uefa-ethics-chiefs-clears-greeks-in-match-fixing-scandal-for-europa-league|title=Exclusive: UEFA ethics chief clears Greeks in match-fixing scandal for Europa League - Inside World Football|author=Paul Nicholson|publisher=|accessdate=16 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the ''[[The Daily Telegraph|Telegraph]]'', UEFA did not respond to a request to confirm whether Infantino’s deputy, Theodore Theodoridis, had recused himself from any discussions or decisions about the handling of the Olympiakos case, because of the relationship of Theodoridis’s father, Savvas, vice-president of Olympiakos, and Theodoridis Jnr.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/news/11742597/Match-fixing-case-in-Greece-just-adds-to-sense-of-Greek-chaos.html|title=Match-fixing case in Greece just adds to sense of Greek chaos|date=15 July 2015|work=Telegraph.co.uk|accessdate=16 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8295">The '''Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967''' ('''ADEA'''; {{usc|29|621}} to {{usc|29|634}}) is a [[US labor law]] that forbids [[employment]] [[discrimination]] against anyone at least 40 years of age in the [[United States]] (see {{usc|29|631}}). In 1967, the bill was signed into law by President [[Lyndon B. Johnson]]. The ADEA prevents [[ageism|age discrimination]] and provides equal employment opportunity under conditions that were not explicitly covered in [[Title VII]] of the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Glenn|first1=Jeremy J.|last2=Little|first2=Katelan E.|title=A Study of the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967|journal=GPSolo|date=November 2014|volume=31|issue=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also applies to  the standards for [[pensions]] and [[employment benefits|benefits provided by employers]], and requires that information concerning the needs of older workers be provided to the general public. 

==Scope of protection==
The ADEA includes a broad ban against age discrimination against workers over the age of forty,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Larson|first1=Aaron|title=Age Discrimination Law|url=https://www.expertlaw.com/library/employment/age_discrimination.html|website=ExpertLaw|accessdate=28 September 2017|date=25 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and also specifically prohibits:

* Discrimination in [[Recruitment|hiring]], promotions, wages, and [[termination of employment]] and [[layoffs]].
* Statements of specifications in age preference or limitations.
* Denial of benefits to older employees: an employer may reduce benefits based on age only if the cost of providing the reduced benefits to older workers is the same as the cost of providing full benefits to younger workers.
* Since 1986, it has prohibited mandatory retirement in most sectors, with phased elimination of mandatory retirement for tenured workers, such as college professors, in 1993.

Mandatory retirement based on age is permitted for:
* Executives over age 65 in high policy-making positions who are entitled to a pension over a minimum yearly amount.

The ADEA applies to employers who employ at least twenty employees on a regular basis within the current or prior calendar year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Thresholds for Coverage Under Employment-Related Laws|url=http://www.twc.state.tx.us/news/efte/thresholds_for_coverage.html|website=Texas Workforce Commission|accessdate=28 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Amendments==
The ADEA was first amended in 1986, and then again in 1991 by the Older Workers Benefit Protection Act (Pub. L. 101-433) and the [[Civil Rights Act of 1991]] (Pub. L. 102-166).

==Case law==
The ADEA differs from the Civil Rights Act in that the ADEA applies to employers of 20 or more employees (see {{usc|29|630(b)}}) rather than 15 or more employees. Both acts do, however, only apply to employers in industries affecting interstate commerce. The 20 employees can include overseas employees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Morelli v. Cedel  141 F.3d 39, 45 (2nd Cir. 1998)|url=https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=3529498746539865340|website=Google Scholar|publisher=Google|accessdate=28 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ADEA protects US citizens working for US employers operating abroad except where it would violate the laws of that country.&lt;ref name="29usc623"&gt;See subsection (f)(1), {{cite web|title=29 U.S. Code Sec. 623 - Prohibition of age discrimination|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/29/623|website=Legal Information Institute|publisher=Cornell Law School|accessdate=28 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mahoney v. RFE/RL, Inc., 47 F.3d 447, 449 (DC Cir. 1995)|url=https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=17350426720272097522|website=Google Scholar|publisher=Google|accessdate=28 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An age limit may be legally specified in the circumstance where age has been shown to be a "[[bona fide occupational qualification]] [BFOQ] reasonably necessary to the normal operation of the particular business" (see {{usc|29|623(f)(1)}}). In practice, BFOQs for age are limited to the obvious (hiring a young actor to play a young character in a movie) or when public safety is at stake (for example, in the case of age limits for pilots and bus drivers).

The ADEA does not stop an employer from favoring an older employee over a younger one, even when the younger one is over 40 years old.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/02-1080.ZS.html ''General Dynamics Land Sys., Inc. v. Cline'', 540 U.S. 581 (2004)]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Supreme Court of the United States|United States Supreme Court]], in [[List of United States Supreme Court cases, volume 554|''Meacham v. Knolls Atomic Power Lab'']], 554 U.S. 84 (2008), held that the employer, not the employee, bears the burden of proving that a layoff or other action that hurts older workers more than others was based not on age but on some other “reasonable factor.”&lt;ref name=NYTimes01&gt;{{cite news|last=Greenhouse|first=Linda|title=A Supreme Court Victory for Older Workers|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/06/20/washington/20scotus.html|accessdate=March 1, 2012|newspaper=New York Times|date=June 20, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[Gomez-Perez v. Potter]]'' (2008), the Supreme Court allowed federal workers who experience retaliation as a result of reporting age discrimination under the law to sue for damages.

In ''[[Kimel v. Florida Bd. of Regents]]'', 528 U.S. 62 (2000), the Supreme Court held that state employees cannot sue states for monetary damages under the ADEA in federal court. The [[EEOC]] may still enforce the ADEA against states, and state employees may still sue state officials for [[declaratory relief|declaratory]] and [[injunctive relief]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Feder |first=Jody |title=The Age Discrimination in Employment Act  (ADEA): A Legal Overview |url=http://aging.senate.gov/crs/aging21.pdf |publisher=Congressional Research Service, June 23, 2010, p. 2 |accessdate=3 November 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110705135926/http://aging.senate.gov/crs/aging21.pdf |archivedate=5 July 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Remedies==
ADEA remedies include compensatory and punitive damages for employee or damages if reinstatement is not feasible and/or employer's violation is intentional.

==Defenses==
Statutory&lt;ref name="29usc623"/&gt; defenses to ADEA claims include:
* Employers may enforce waivers of age discrimination claims made without EEOC or court approval if the waiver is "knowing or voluntary."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Blakeney v. Lomas Information Systems, Inc. 65 F3d 482, 484 (5th Cir. 1995)|url=https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=16607583013917153271|website=Google Scholar|publisher=Google|accessdate=28 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Valid arbitration agreements between employers and employees covering the dispute are subject to compulsory arbitration and no court action can be brought.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ilmer v. Interstate/Johnson Lane Corporation 500 US 20, 26, 111 S.Ct. 1647, 1652 (1991)|url=https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=9166001121208093862|website=Google Scholar|publisher=Google|accessdate=28 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Employers can [[Termination of employment|discharge]] or [[discipline]] an employee for "good cause," regardless of the employee's age.
* Employers can take an action based on "reasonable factors other than age."
* Bona fide occupational qualifications, seniority systems, employee benefit or early retirement plans.
* Voluntary early retirement incentives.

The '''[[Banu (arabic)|Banu]] Ka'b''' ({{lang-ar|بنو كعب}}) are an [[Arab]] nomadic tribe originating in the [[Najd]] region of [[Arabia]], who often raided, then settled various areas of southern and central [[Ottoman Iraq]], in cities such as [[Basra]] and [[Nasariyah]], and also across the border in the southernmost region of [[Khuzestan Province]] of [[Persia]], particularly near the city of [[Khorramshahr]]. From the early 18th century onwards, the Banu Ka'b began converting from [[Sunni]] to [[Shia Islam]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=agMu0nfdFZ4C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=The+Shi%27is+of+Iraq+By+Yitzhak+Nakash&amp;as_brr=3 The Shi'is of Iraq By Yitzhak Nakash, pg. 27], and Haydari, ‘Unwan al-Majd, pg. 110-15, 118&lt;/ref&gt;

Some members of this tribe are direct descendants of [[Muhammad]] through Imam [[Musa Al-Kadhim]], which makes them Sayyids. These Sayyids reside in Iraq.

Another branch of the Banu Ka'b settled in the areas that are now [[Oman]] and the [[United Arab Emirates]].

Individuals who are members of or are descended from the tribe often have the surname ''Kaabi'' or ''al-Kaabi''. Those from the tribe who reside within Iran often carry the dialectal spelling variant ''Chaab'' or ''Chabi''.

Banu Ka'b had their tribe flag as plain yellow banner. They have waged wars with neighbouring nations. For example, a famous naval battle, called Al-Raqah, occurred in the Persian Gulf between Bani Kaab and Kuwait. Bani Kaab were defeated by the Kuwaiti forces.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8640">'''Böszörmény''', also '''Izmaelita''' ''(Hysmaelita / [[Ishmael]]ites)'' or '''Szerecsen''' ''(Saracens)'', is a name for the [[Muslim]]s who lived in the [[Kingdom of Hungary]] in the 10–13th centuries. Some of the ''Böszörmény'' probably joined the federation of the seven [[Magyar tribes]] during the 9th century, and later smaller groups of Muslims arrived in the [[Pannonian Basin|Carpathian Basin]]. They were engaged in trading but some of them were employed as mercenaries by the [[King of Hungary|kings of Hungary]]. Their rights were gradually restricted from the 11th century on, and they were coerced to accept baptism following the establishment of the [[Christian]] [[Kingdom of Hungary]]. They "disappeared" (probably became Christian) by the end of the 13th century.

==Origins==
Modern authors claim that several groups of Muslims migrated to the Carpathian Basin in the course of the 10th–12th centuries; therefore, the Muslims living in the Kingdom of Hungary were composed of various ethnic groups. Most of them must have arrived from [[Volga Bulgaria]], but [[Toponymy|toponyms]] suggest that Muslim ('''káliz''': ''[[khalyzians]]'') people arrived also from [[Khwarezm]]; these latter (or part of them) may have formed one of the three tribes of the [[Kabar]]s who joined the federation of the Magyar tribes in the 9th century.

The Arab historian and geographer, [[Abu al-Hasan 'Alī al-Mas'ūdī|al-Mas'ūdī]] recorded in the 10th century that the heads of the tribal confederation had welcomed Muslim merchants and the merchants could even convert some of the Magyars into [[Islam]].&lt;ref name='Peoples in Hungary'&gt;{{cite book | last = Kristó | first = Gyula | title = Nem magyar népek a középkori Magyarországon ''(Non-Hungarian Peoples in the Medieval Hungary)'' | publisher = Lucidus Kiadó | date = 2003 | location = Budapest | isbn = 963-9465-15-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Abū 'Ubayd 'Abd Allāh al-Bakrī|Al-Bakrī]] also mentioned that the Magyars ransomed the Muslims who had been captured in the neighboring countries. In the 10th century, [[Abraham ben Jacob|Ibrahim ibn Yaqub]] described the Muslim merchants who arrived in [[Prague]] from the territories of the Magyars and traded with [[slavery|slaves]] and [[tin]]. The ''[[Gesta Hungarorum]]'' recorded that lots of Muslims arrived in the Carpathian Basin from Volga Bulgaria during the reign of [[Taksony of Hungary|Taksony]], Grand Prince of the Magyars ({{circa}} 955 – before 972) and they settled down there.&lt;ref name='Peoples in Hungary' /&gt;
The work of the Muslim traveler, [[Abu Hamid al-Garnati]], who spent three years in the kingdom (1150–1153), proves that the Muslims living in the Kingdom of Hungary were composed of two groups: the [[Khwarezm]]ians and the ''Maghrebians'' (Böszörmény). He was entrusted by King [[Géza II of Hungary]] to recruit soldiers among the ''Maghrebians'' (Böszörmény) living east of the Carpathian Basin. The Byzantine historian [[John Kinnamos]] mentioned that ''káliz'' warriors were captured during the war between the kingdom and the Byzantine Empire in 1165 and the Emperor [[Manuel I Komnenos]] removed some of them to Byzantine territories.&lt;ref name='Peoples in Hungary' /&gt;

==Muslim territories in the Kingdom of Hungary==
The Muslims settled down in several groups in the Carpathian Basin. Their largest communities lived in the southern parts of the Kingdom of Hungary in [[Syrmia]] and in region where the [[Drava]] joins the [[Danube]]. Other significant groups of Muslims lived in and around [[Pest, Hungary|Pest]], in the [[Nyírség]] (around [[Hajdúböszörmény]]) and around [[Nitra]] ({{lang-hu|Nyitra}}).&lt;ref name='Peoples in Hungary' /&gt; The Arab geographer [[Yaqut al-Hamawi]] mentioned that Muslims from the Kingdom of Hungary were studying in [[Aleppo]] in the beginning of the 13th century. The students arrived in Aleppo from a frontier region of the kingdom where the Muslims lived in 30 settlements.&lt;ref name='Peoples in Hungary' /&gt;

==The Muslims' life in the kingdom==
Most of the Muslims in the Kingdom of Hungary were engaged in trading and they were rich enough to lease royal properties in the 13th century. Other Muslims were employed in the king's army and took part in the wars against the Byzantine Empire. Yaqut al-Hamawi's work proves that the Muslim population spoke the [[Hungarian language]] by the beginning of the 13th century.&lt;ref name="Peoples in Hungary"/&gt;

Royal decrees issued in the second half of the 11th century by the kings of Hungary persecuted the Muslims, requiring their conversion into Christianity. King [[Ladislaus I of Hungary]] commanded that converted Muslims who continued to follow Islam were to be removed from their original settlements. King [[Coloman of Hungary]] ordered that each Muslim settlement had to build a church, and he prohibited marriage between Muslims. Probably in the next century, the kings also prohibited the building of walls around Muslim settlements.

By the period of King Géza II (1141–1162), the ''káliz'' people could practise their faith only in secrecy. The "Maghrebian" soldiers followed Islam openly, but it was Abu Hamid al-Garnati who taught them several Islamic traditions. Upon his request, the king even permitted the "Maghrebians" to have concubines.&lt;ref name="Peoples in Hungary"/&gt;

==Muslims in the 13th century==
The [[Golden Bull of 1222|Golden Bull]] of King [[Andrew II of Hungary|Andrew II]] prohibited the employment of Muslims as minters and tax collectors.&lt;ref name='Történeti Kronológia'&gt;{{cite book | last = Benda | first = Kálmán (editor) | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = Magyarország történeti kronológiája ''("The Historical Chronology of Hungary")''| publisher = Akadémiai Kiadó | date = 1981 | location = Budapest |  url = | doi = | id = | isbn = 963-05-2661-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The king, however, continued to employ them in his administration. On 3 March 1231, [[Pope Gregory IX]] requested the prelates of the kingdom to protest against this practise and also authorized them to use ecclesiastical penalties for this reason. In the same year, King Andrew had to confirm the provisions of the Golden Bull but he still employed Muslims. Therefore, on 25 February 1232, Archbishop [[Robert of Esztergom]] placed the Kingdom of Hungary under an [[interdict]] and excommunicated some high dignitaries of the king. Pope Gregory IX sent a legate to the kingdom who reached an agreement with King Andrew on 20 August 1233 in [[Bereg County|Bereg]].&lt;ref name='Történeti Kronológia' /&gt; Under the agreement, the Muslims and the [[Jews]] could not hold royal offices and they were obliged to wear distinctive cloths. However, the king did not fulfill all the provisions of the agreement and therefore he was excommunicated, although he was absolved soon. On 10 December 1239, Pope Gregory IX even authorized King [[Béla IV of Hungary]] to lease his revenues to non-Christians.&lt;ref name='Történeti Kronológia' /&gt;

Nevertheless, following the [[Mongol invasion of Europe|Mongol invasion of the kingdom]] (1241–1242) references to the Muslims in the kingdom became scarce. In 1290, King [[Ladislaus IV of Hungary]] appointed a former Muslim, [[Mizse]], to the office of the [[Palatine (Kingdom of Hungary)|Palatine]].

The ''Böszörmény'' denomination is preserved as a family name and in [[toponym]]s, such as [[Hajdúböszörmény]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://epa.niif.hu/00000/00021/00036/mksz2003_1_05.htm "History of Hungary"] {{hu icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Chané''' is the collective name for the southernmost [[Arawak language|Arawak-speaking]] peoples.  They lived in the plains of the northern [[Gran Chaco]] and in the foothills of the [[Andes]] in [[Paraguay]], [[Brazil]], [[Bolivia]], and [[Argentina]]. The historical Chané are divided into two principal groups. The Chané proper who lived in eastern Bolivia and the Guaná who lived in Paraguay and adjacent Brazil. Twenty-first century survivors of the Chané are the Izoceno people of Bolivia and 3,034 descendants reported in Argentina by the 2010 census.  Survivors of the Guaná are the [[Terena language|Tereno]] and the Kinikinao both of [[Mato Grosso do Sul]] province in Brazil.&lt;ref&gt;Censo Nacional de Poblacion, Hogares y Viviendas," https://www.indec.gov.ar/ftp/cuadros/poblacion/censo2010_tomo1.pdf, accessed 18 Dec 2017&lt;/ref&gt;     

Most of the historical Chané were subjects of and absorbed by the [[Eastern Bolivian Guarani]], commonly called Chiriguanos, while the Guaná were subjects of the [[Mbayá]], a [[Guaycuruan languages|Guaycuruan]] speaking people.  

==History==
The Chané, together with other [[Arawak peoples|Arawak]] groups, are believed to have originated in northeastern South America, but to have spread southward about 2,500 years ago. They developed an agrarian culture, built densely populated villages, cultivated corn, peanuts, cotton and squash, and are famous for their ceramics and graphics which have been found mainly in the pampas of Bolivia surrounding the city of [[Santa Cruz de la Sierra]] and in [[Samaipata, Bolivia|Samaipata]], [[Portachuelo]], Valle Abajo, Okinawa, [[Cotoca]], El Pari, Mataral and Warnes.&lt;ref&gt;Tras la Huella de los Chané, El Deber, June 1, 2003&lt;/ref&gt; They also craft wooden masks and fabric clothing.

An ancient Chané religious site dating from about 300 CE is [[El Fuerte de Samaipata]], now a [[UNESCO World Heritage Site]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/883]. Accessed 23 Sep 2016&lt;/ref&gt; 

They were a rather peaceful culture and traded with the [[Quechua language|Quechua]]-speaking [[Inca]]s in the Andes and with other Arawak-speaking groups to the north and east. Chanés and Incas established a truce to join forces against the [[Eastern Guarani]] peoples of the Andes foothills, who the Incas and Spaniards called ''Chiriguanos''.  The Chiriguanos raided the Chané homeland on a regular basis, and prior to the Spanish conquest, the Chiriguanos defeated the Chanés and halted the Inca advance into the plains and valleys of what is now the [[Santa Cruz Department (Bolivia)|Santa Cruz Department]] of [[Bolivia]]. Some Chane weré forced into slavery by the Chiriguanos, others migrated to less fertile regions to the southeast. Many Chané women were taken as wives by Chiriguano men, thus starting a process of assimilation. Both Guaraní and [[Guaraní language|Guaraní]]-speaking Chané also assimilated and mixed with Europeans during the colonial period and after the independence of both Argentina and Bolivia.

==The Guaná==

The Guaná, (also called Layaná) are the eastern branch of the Chané.  The were vassals of the Mbayá, a relationship that, according to Spanish accounts, existed in 1548, and possibly much earlier.&lt;ref&gt;Santos-Granero, Fernando (2009), ''Vital Enemies'', Austin: University of Texas Press, p. 38. Downloaded from [[Project Muse]].&lt;/ref&gt;  The Guaná were agricultural and pedestrian as opposed to the nomadic Mbayá who became equestrians by the early 17th century. In the early 18th century the Guaná lived in seven large villages of 1,000 or more people on the western side of the Paraguay River between 19 and 22 south latitudes. Later in the 18th century, some of them migrated along with the Mbayá east of the Paraguay River. They were estimated, perhaps generously, in the early 18th century to have numbered 18,000 to 30,000.  In 1793 they numbered about 8,200.&lt;ref&gt;Steward, pp. 239-240&lt;/ref&gt;

The Guaná provided Mbayá chiefs with labor, agricultural products, textiles, and wives and in exchange were given protection and European goods such as iron tools by the Mbayá. The cultures of the Guaná and Mbayá slowly became more similar as the Mbayá adopted agriculture and weaving and the Guaná became equestrian. The Mbayá augmented their numbers, strictly limited by late marriages and [[abortion]], by intermarriage with Guaná and captive women of other ethnic groups.&lt;ref&gt;Saegar, pp. 18, 87-88, 116&lt;/ref&gt; Spanish chroniclers describe the Guaná as docile.  The Mbayá, arrogant and ethnocentric, were described by Spanish chroniclers as surprisingly benign and respectful in dealing with their Guaná subjects.&lt;ref&gt;Hemming, John (1978), ''Red Gold: The Conquest of the Brazilian Indians,'' Cambridge: Harvard University Press, pp 394-395&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 18th century the Guaná, along with the Mbayá, migrated east of the Paraguay River, and by 1850 the Guaná had broken their relationship with the Mbayá and were living in the area of [[Miranda, Mato Grosso do Sul]], Brazil.  The largest sub-tribe of the Guaná was the Tereno who numbered 3 to 4 thousand at the time.&lt;ref&gt;Steward, Julian H. (1946), ''Handbook of South American Indians, Volume 1, The Marginal Tribes'', Washington: Smithsonian Institution, pp 238-241&lt;/ref&gt; In 2001, they were called the Terêna, and 16,000 if them were living in the same area.&lt;ref&gt;"Terêna", http://www.ethnologue.com/18/language/ter/, accessed 28 Dec 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

==Distribution==
There are some Chané communities still living in the [[Izozog]] region in [[Santa Cruz, Bolivia]], and in [[Yacui]] and Che-Renda near [[Tartagal, Argentina]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://eprints.rclis.org/13555/1/Glosario_pueblos_indigenas.pdf Glosario de lenguas indígenas sudamericanas, Edgardo Civallero, Universidad Nacional de Córdoba]{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In both cases, they have been influenced by the Guaraní language and culture, but still retain their Chane identity.  The other descendants of the Chane culture were first mixed with the Guaranis, later with the Spaniards, and in the last two centuries with migration flows of other Europeans, Arabs, and migrants from other parts of Bolivia and Argentina.  The Chane culture is an important heritage component of the populations of Santa Cruz, the Paraguayan Chaco, [[Salta Province]], [[Jujuy Province]] and the Argentine Chaco.

{{Hispanic and Latino Americans}}
The '''Congressional Hispanic Conference''' ('''CHC''') is a [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]]-controlled caucus in the [[United States Congress]]. Currently with six members,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://hispanicconference-mariodiazbalart.house.gov/membership |title= Members | author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |website= Congressional Hispanic Conference |access-date= January 17, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; the CHC was formed in 2003, with the stated goal of promoting policy outcomes of importance to Americans of [[Hispanic and Latino Americans|Hispanic or Latino]] and [[Portuguese American|Portuguese]] descent. These priorities included support of the following: then-President [[George W. Bush]] and American troops in the war against terrorism; the [[Free Trade Agreement of the Americas]] (FTAA); tax relief to families and the over two million Hispanic- and Portuguese-owned small businesses; support for [[faith based initiatives]]; and, educational choice for all. The impetus behind the Conference's creation was the debate surrounding the nomination of conservative lawyer [[Miguel Estrada]] to the [[DC Circuit Court of Appeals]].&lt;ref name=people&gt;Henry Bonilla, et al., [https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB104786911197082300?mod=opinion%255Fmain%255Fcommentaries "We the (Hispanic) People...,"] ''Wall Street Journal'' (March 17, 2003)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Julian Pecquet, [http://www.adelantesi.com/Archive/Apr03/congresspeople_eng.htm "Latinos Take Over Washington,"] ''Adelante'' (April 2003)&lt;/ref&gt; The Congressional Hispanic Conference should not be confused with the older [[Congressional Hispanic Caucus]], which is another congressional organization populated by [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] members of Congress.

==History==
In the mid to late 1990s, the Republican members of the [[Congressional Hispanic Caucus]] – Mexican-American [[Henry Bonilla]] of Texas and Cuban-Americans [[Ileana Ros-Lehtinen]] and [[Lincoln Diaz-Balart]] of Florida – left the Caucus in protest over its support for improved relations with [[Cuba]].&lt;ref name=form&gt;Maria Recio, [http://www.hispanicbusiness.com/news/2003/3/19/hispanic_republicans_form_interest_group.htm "Hispanic Republicans Form Interest Group,"] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20130125073846/http://www.hispanicbusiness.com/news/2003/3/19/hispanic_republicans_form_interest_group.htm |date=2013-01-25 }} ''HispanicBusiness.com'' (March 19, 2003)&lt;/ref&gt; While Ros-Lehtinen remained an active member of the CHC's public outreach arm, the [[Congressional Hispanic Caucus Institute]], the Caucus has since been composed solely of Democratic and Democratic-caucusing independent legislators.&lt;ref&gt;CHCI, [http://www.chci.org/about/page/board-of-directors-2 Board of Directors] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090715172501/http://www.chci.org/about/page/board-of-directors-2 |date=2009-07-15 }} ''CHCI''. Accessed on May 5, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Congressional Hispanic Caucus, [http://velazquez.house.gov/chc/ CHC Main Page, Membership (sidebar)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090527232816/http://velazquez.house.gov/chc/ |date=2009-05-27 }} ''Office of Nydia Velasquez''. Accessed on May 31, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

Feeling there was "significant need" for a "new Hispanic conference" newly elected Florida congressman [[Mario Diaz-Balart]] began to organize in 2002 a [[Congressional caucus|caucus]] for Hispanic Republicans to counter what they felt was Democratic dominance over Hispanic political affairs. On March 17, 2003, Diaz-Balart revealed the formation of the Conference in an open letter published in the ''[[Wall Street Journal]]''.&lt;ref name=people/&gt; Joined by Bonilla, Ros-Lehtinen, his brother Lincoln, and newly elected colleague [[Devin Nunes]], a [[California]] congressman of Portuguese (Azorean) descent, Diaz-Balart decried what he perceived as Hispanic Democratic efforts to derail the nomination of Estrada, a selection seen by some at the time as a possible fast track to the [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]].&lt;ref name=form/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Robert A. George, [http://www.nbcwashington.com/news/us_world/Sonia-Sotomayor-For-Life.html "Sonia Sotomayor (For life),"] ''NBC Washington.com'' (May 28, 2009)&lt;/ref&gt; The group was officially announced at a press conference two days later. They were soon joined by two more [[Portuguese American]] congressmen, [[Richard Pombo]] of California and [[Patrick Toomey]] of Pennsylvania.&lt;ref&gt;Congressional Hispanic Conference, [http://www.hispanianews.com/archive/2003/11/14/03.htm "The Congressional Hispanic Conference Applauds the Passage of the Naturalization Bill for Immigrant Service Men and Women,"] (press release) ''Hispania News'' (November 14, 2003)&lt;/ref&gt;

Like their Democratic counterpart, the Conference allows members from the [[United States Senate|Senate]]. [[Mel Martinez]], the first Cuban-American US Senator, joined the group shortly after his election in 2004. Additionally, the Conference is open to non-Hispanic "associate" members who represent districts with significant Hispanic populations or generally support its goals with regards to public policy.&lt;ref&gt;Office of Rep. J. Gresham Barrett, [http://www.house.gov/list/press/sc03_barrett/Hispanic_Conference.html "Congressman Gresham Barrett Joins the Congressional Hispanic Conference,"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081101173428/http://www.house.gov/list/press/sc03_barrett/Hispanic_Conference.html |date=2008-11-01 }} (press release) ''House.gov'' (March 31, 2004)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Office of Rep.

In the 2006 and 2008 elections, the Conference suffered the loss of nearly half of their members to electoral defeat, attempts at higher office or resignations. Past chair [[Luis Fortuño]] left Congress after being elected [[Governor of Puerto Rico]]. After the [[United States elections, 2010|2010 midterm elections]], six new Hispanic Republicans were elected to Congress: Senator [[Marco Rubio]] of Florida, Representatives [[David Rivera]] of Florida, [[Raúl Labrador]] of [[Idaho]], [[Francisco Canseco]] and [[Bill Flores]] of Texas, and [[Jaime Herrera Beutler]] of [[Washington (U.S. state)|Washington]], as well as Portuguese American Senator Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania, who was a member of the conference when he served in the House.

'''Crime''' is present in various forms in [[Sri Lanka]]. Crime is segmented into two broad classifications:  grave crimes (those which are indictable) and minor crimes (those which are not). Exceptions can be made for [[criminal liability]] on the grounds of duress, insanity, intoxication, necessity, and private defense. Punishment for crime includes several options: community service, fine, forfeiture of property, imprisonment, institutional treatment, probation, suspended sentence, whipping, and death;&lt;ref name="Newman2010"&gt;{{cite book|last=Newman|first=Graeme R.|title=Crime and Punishment around the World: [Four Volumes]|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2uK6bR9byVIC&amp;pg=RA2-PA21|date=30 October 2010|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=978-0-313-35134-1|pages=21–}}&lt;/ref&gt; while the death penalty is available in the country, there have been no executions since 1976.&lt;ref name="Ghosh2013"&gt;{{cite news|last=Ghosh|first=Palash|title=Despite Wave Of Violent Crime, Sri Lanka Remains Wary About Death Penalty|url=http://www.ibtimes.com/despite-wave-violent-crime-sri-lanka-remains-wary-about-death-penalty-1220329|accessdate=12 June 2013|date=April 26, 2013|newspaper=[[International Business Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Crimes against women and children==
Sri Lanka [[Prostitution in Sri Lanka|is a participant in the prostitution industry]], and most consumers of the trade in the country are foreign travellers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fcYq72qYRTcC&amp;pg=PA452 |pages=452– |title=Encyclopedia of Prostitution and Sex Work |publisher=Greenwood |isbn=9780313329685 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, most prostitution-related acts, such as [[human trafficking|prostitute trafficking]] and [[procuring (prostitution)|procuring]] are illegal. Prostitution has not become as severe an issue in Sri Lanka as compared to the situation in some neighbouring countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/hrrpt/2004/41744.htm |title= Country Report on Human Rights Practices in Sri Lanka |publisher=State.gov |date=2008-03-11 |accessdate=2010-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Child trafficking is a problem in Sri Lanka. Most children trafficked are treated unfairly, unwillingly and inhumanely turned into pornographic film actors or sex slaves. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= Sex tourists prey on Sri Lanka's children: Beach resorts are hunting-grounds for European child abusers and pornographic video makers.

==Corruption==
{{See|Corruption in Sri Lanka}}

Corruption is prevalent in Sri Lanka. Cited as "one of the most corrupt nations in the world" by Lakshman Indranath Keerthisinghe of the ''Lanka Standard'',&lt;ref name="Lanka 1"/&gt; there have been instances in which law enforcers take bribes from offenders who wish to have their offences waived. The government has made an effort to curb corruption in the country and a handful of corrupt individuals have been arrested and appropriately charged.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.humanrights.asia/resources/journals-magazines/article2/0901/03bribery-and-corruption-control-in-sri-lanka |title=Bribery and corruption control in Sri Lanka |publisher=Asian Human Rights Commission |accessdate=June 12, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Corruption is considered a large expense to the Sri Lankan government.&lt;ref name="Lanka 1"&gt;{{cite web|author=Lakshman Indranath Keerthisinghe |title=Sri Lanka one of the most corrupt nations in the world |date=October 23, 2011 |url=http://www.lankastandard.com/2011/10/sri-lanka-one-of-the-most-corrupt-nations-in-the-world/ |publisher=Lanka Standard }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, corruption does not appear to be significant enough to pose  a problem with [[foreign direct investment|foreign investment]], though it is considered to be a persistent issue with customs clearance and smuggling of some consumer products.&lt;ref name="Ibpus2012"&gt;{{cite book|author=International Business Publications, USA|title=Sri Lanka Business Law Handbook: Strategic Information and Laws|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=43GeRBYUgJ4C&amp;pg=PA98|date=1 January 2012|publisher=International Business Publications|isbn=978-1-4387-7107-6|pages=98–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Investigation==
The crime division of the Police Department of Sri Lanka has several branches. Its primary mission is to protect against all types of crimes in the country. It makes appropriate coordination with civil and military agencies, apprehends criminals, and take appropriate legal actions after the commitment of crime.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.police.lk/index.php/crime-division|title=Crime division|accessdate=19 June 2013|publisher=Sri Lanka Police}}&lt;/ref&gt; The department also has the Police Human Rights Division which was  established in 2002 with a mandate to examine and prevent human rights violations with which their officers may be charged while on duty.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url= http://www.police.lk/index.php/human-rights|title= Human Rights |accessdate=19 June 2013|publisher=Sri Lanka Police}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5198">In [[linguistics]], '''critical language awareness''' ('''CLA''') refers to an understanding of social, political, and ideological aspects of language, linguistic variation, and discourse. It functions as a pedagogical application of a [[critical discourse analysis]] (CDA), which is a research approach that regards language as a social practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mosley Wetzel|first=Melissa|last2=Rogers|first2=Rebecca|date=2015-12-01|title=Constructing racial literacy through critical language awareness: A case study of a beginning literacy teacher|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0898589815000352|journal=Linguistics and Education|series=Special Issue on Critical Language Awareness Approaches in the Americas: theoretical principles, pedagogical practices and distribution of intellectual labor|volume=32, Part A|pages=27–40|doi=10.1016/j.linged.2015.03.014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Critical language awareness as a part of language education teaches students how to analyze the language that they and others use. More specifically, critical language awareness is a consideration of how features of language such as words, grammar, and discourse choices reproduce, reinforce, or challenge certain ideologies and struggles for power and dominance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Luke|first=Allan|date=2012-01-06|title=Critical Literacy: Foundational Notes|journal=Theory into Practice|volume=51|issue=1|pages=4–11|doi=10.1080/00405841.2012.636324|issn=0040-5841}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Regarding linguistic variation, Fairclough argued that it is insufficient to teach students to use "appropriate" language without considering why that language is preferred and who makes that decision (as well as the implications for speakers who do not use "appropriate language").&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Global capitalism and critical awareness of language|url=http://www.schools.ash.org.au/litweb/norman1.html|first=Norman|last=Fairclough|accessdate=2009-07-29|publisher=Schools on the Web|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120909092406/http://www.schools.ash.org.au/litweb/norman1.html|archivedate=2012-09-09|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

CLA generally includes consideration of how a person may be marginalized by speaking a particular way, especially if that way of speaking serves as an index of their [[race (classification of human beings)|race]], [[ethnicity]], [[religion]], [[social status]], etc.

Because power is reproduced through language, CLA is "a prerequisite for effective [[democracy|democratic]] [[citizenship]], and should therefore be seen as an entitlement for citizens, especially children developing towards citizenship in the educational system".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Clark, Romy|year=1990|title=Critical Language Awareness Part I: A Critical Review of Three Current Approaches to Language Awareness.|journal=Language and Education: An International Journal|volume=4|issue=4|pages=249–60|issn=0950-0782|url=http://www.eric.ed.gov/ERICWebPortal/custom/portlets/recordDetails/detailmini.jsp?_nfpb=true&amp;_&amp;ERICExtSearch_SearchValue_0=EJ437787&amp;ERICExtSearch_SearchType_0=no&amp;accno=EJ437787|accessdate=2009-07-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Reginald Mpho Monareng|first= Rakwena |title=The Critical Language Awareness Perspective within the English Second Language Teacher Development|journal=The International Journal of the Humanities|volume=5|issue=1|pages=67–74|url=http://ijh.cgpublisher.com/product/pub.26/prod.968|accessdate=2009-07-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author2=Deborah Mehl|author3=Shirley Pendlebury |year=1991|title=Grey areas and open minds: critical language awareness for student teachers |journal=Journal of Curriculum Studies|volume=23|issue=5|pages=435–448|issn=1366-5839|doi=10.1080/0022027910230506|author=Mehl, Deborah}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=H.

== Applications ==
Critical language awareness has been applied to educating students in [[South Africa]] how language was used to maintain and perpetuate the [[apartheid]] state.&lt;ref&gt;Janks, H. (1993).

'''Dialects of Pars''' are a group of southwestern and northwestern Iranian dialects spoken in the central [[Fars Province|Pars]] province. The southwestern dialects can be divided into three families of dialects according to geographical distribution and local names: Southwestern (''[[Lori dialects|Lori]]''), South-central ([[Kuhmareyi language|Kuhmareyi]]) and Southeastern (''[[Larestani dialects|Larestani]]'').&lt;ref name="Iranica1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/fars-viii |title=FĀRS viii.

&lt;poem&gt;
'There is a budding morrow in midnight:'—
So sang our Keats, our English nightingale.
And here, as lamps across the bridge turn pale
In London's smokeless resurrection-light,
Dark breaks to dawn. But o'er the deadly blight
Of love deflowered and sorrow of none avail,
Which makes this man gasp and this woman quail,
Can day from darkness ever again take flight?

Ah! gave not these two hearts their mutual pledge,
Under one mantle sheltered 'neath the hedge
In gloaming courtship? And, O God! today
He only knows he holds her;—but what part
Can life now take? She cries in her locked heart,—
'Leave me—I do not know you—go away!'

{{Christianity and gender|theology}}

The term '''fallen woman''' was used to describe a woman who has "lost her innocence", and fallen from the [[Grace (Christianity)|grace of God]]. In [[Victorian era|19th-century Britain]] especially, the meaning came to be closely associated with the loss or surrender of a woman's [[chastity]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nochlin|first=Linda|date=1978|title=Lost and Found: Once More the Fallen Woman|journal=The Art Bulletin|volume=60|issue=1|pages=139–153|doi=10.1080/00043079.1978.10787522|pmid=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and with [[female promiscuity]]. Its use was an expression of the belief that to be socially and morally acceptable, a [[Female sexuality|woman's sexuality]] and experience should be entirely restricted to [[Marriage in the United Kingdom|marriage]], and that she should also be under the supervision and care of an authoritative man. Used when society offered few employment opportunities for women in times of crisis or hardship, the term was often more specifically associated with [[Prostitution in the United Kingdom|prostitution]], which was regarded as both cause and effect of a woman being "fallen". The term is considered to be [[anachronistic]] in the 21st century,&lt;ref&gt;''The Oxford English Dictionary'': "A fallen woman"&lt;/ref&gt; although it has considerable importance in social history and appears in many literary works (see also [[Illegitimacy in fiction]]).

==Theological links==
The idea that Eve, from the biblical story in the ''[[Book of Genesis]]'', was the prototypical fallen woman has been widely accepted by academics,&lt;ref&gt;For example, [[Amanda Anderson]] states "[I]n Augustinian theology, the condition of fallenness derives from the act of original sin" and is thus assumed to be an act reliant upon will: Eve's sexual (or gendered) trespass causes her fall from virtue. {{cite book|last=Anderson|first=Amanda|title=Tainted Souls and Painted Faces|year=1993|publisher=Cornell University Press|location=Ithaca |isbn=978-0-8014-2781-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;  theologians and literary scholars.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Woman and the Demon: The Life of a Victorian Myth|last=Auerbach|first=Nina|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=978-0674954069|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts and London, England|pages=|date=1982-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eve was not expelled from [[Garden of Eden|Eden]] because she had sex outside of marriage; rather she fell from a state of innocence because she ate [[forbidden fruit]] from the [[Tree of the knowledge of good and evil]].  That is, Eve and then Adam reached for knowledge, but in reaching for it, they disobeyed God and lost their original innocence - that is, their lack of anything beyond a childlike awareness of their surroundings; and the resulting complete subservience to God, who demanded to be the only entity with knowledge and its accompanying power. The temptation offered to Adam and Eve in the story was to know what God knows and to see what God sees. It was a temptation based on covetousness and a desire to be like God. (See: [[Prometheus]]) Thus, theologically speaking, there is a metaphor that is related to the [[Fall of Man]] from a state of grace as well as to the expulsion and subsequent fall of [[Lucifer]] from heaven.

==Social situation==
The term "fallen" was nevertheless most often conflated with sexual "knowledge" (''i.e.'', experience), particularly for women at a time when the social value of their sexual inexperience was insisted upon. As the term narrowed to imply any socially unauthorized sexual activity, including premarital or extra-marital sex, whether initiated by the woman or not, it concealed the different reasons for such a "falling" out of God's and society's favor. "Fallen" was therefore an umbrella term that was applied to a variety of women in a variety of settings: she may have been a woman who had had sex once or habitually outside the confines of marriage; a woman of a lower socioeconomic class; a woman who had been raped or seduced by a male aggressor; a woman with a tarnished reputation; or a prostitute. Furthermore, prostitution was defined in a range of ways and the "reality was that hard economic times meant that for many women, prostitution was the only way to make ends meet. Many ... were only transient fallen women, moving in and out of the profession [of prostitution] as family finances dictated."&lt;ref name=Isba&gt;{{cite book|last=Isba|first=Anne|title=Gladstone and Women|year=2006|publisher=Hambledon Continuum|location=London|isbn=978-1-85285-471-3|pages=102}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In some cases, a woman may have been regarded as fallen simply because she was educated, eccentric, or elusive. Whatever the case may be, female fallenness as it appears in each of these renderings was the result of a woman’s deviation from social norms, and in turn strongly linked to moral expectations. In the mid 19th century, for example, "For middle-class men seeking to establish a different basis for authority, from that which had been used by the nobility, [[moral authority]] became the key issue, evident in the power exercised by a man over the nuclear or bourgeois family and in his ability to regulate women's sexuality through her protection and containment in the [[Separate spheres|domestic sphere]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Caine|first=Barbara|title=Gendering European History|year=2000|publisher=Continuum|location=London|isbn=978-0-7185-0131-0|pages=57|author2=Glenda Sluga}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Female dancers and performers have been regarded as deviating from social norms that expect women to stay away from the male gaze, and hence have been described as belonging to the class of "fallen women". In Europe, women dancers were not socially acceptable and in Arabia, "the unveiled [[ghawazi]], who performed publicly for men, were not respected".&lt;ref&gt;Karin van Nieuwkerk, "Changing Images and Shifting Identities: Female Performers in Egypt" in {{cite book|title=Moving History/Dancing Cultures: A Dance History Reader|year=2001|publisher=Wesleyan University Press|location=Durham, North Carolina|isbn=978-0-8195-6412-2|pages=142|author=Ann Cooper Albright|editor=Dils, Ann}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rescue and rehabilitation==
One of the effects of the rapid urbanisation resulting from the [[Industrial Revolution]] in England was that a large number of prostitutes were working in the capital, [[London]].&lt;ref&gt;The contemporary estimate of Henry Mayhew (1812–1887) was that there were around 80,000 at a time when the population was about two and a half million. {{cite book|last=Mayhew|first=Henry |title=London labour and the London poor: cyclopaedia of the conditions and earnings of those that will work, those that cannot work and those that will not work|publisher=Griffith, Bohn|location=London|year=1861–62|oclc=606160932}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was assumed to be a large problem for the city and for the women themselves. Therefore it prompted many rescue and rehabilitation efforts, especially by middle-class women inspired by religious conviction or egalitarian principles or both.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Steinbach|first=Susie|title=Women in England 1760–1914: A Social History|year=2004|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|location=New York|isbn=978-1-4039-6754-1|pages=127}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some people worked on changes to legislation or served on committees to raise funds for charitable initiatives. [[Josephine Butler]], for example, in the context of her efforts against the [[Contagious Diseases Acts]] wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;You must know there are many good men and women in our country who have devoted their lives to the work of reclaiming prostitutes, and of offering protection and aid to women and young girls, who through poverty, ignorance, or evil companionship are in danger of falling into sin. And because several persons working together can do more than each working alone, societies have been formed for this purpose, one of which, the Rescue Society, has in the last seventeen years, opened the doors of its various Homes to no less than 6,722 fallen women and girls, of which number seventy out of every hundred have been restored to a virtuous life, whilst lack of funds has compelled it reluctantly to refuse admission to many others who implored its aid.&lt;ref&gt;reprinted in {{cite book|last=Jeffreys|first=Sheila (Ed.)|title=The Sexuality Debates|year=2001|publisher=Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul|location=London|isbn=978-0-415-25669-8|pages=159}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

Many of the homes were "strict, punitive and vengeful"&lt;ref name="Gay"&gt;{{cite book|last=[[Peter Gay|Gay, Peter]]|title=The Bourgeois Experience: Victoria to Freud Vol II "The Tender Passion"|year=1986|publisher=W.W. Norton &amp; Company|location=New York and London|isbn=978-0-19-503741-8|pages=376}}&lt;/ref&gt; but Urania Cottage, set up and managed by [[Charles Dickens]] with the help of his rich, philanthropic friend [[Angela Burdett-Coutts, 1st Baroness Burdett-Coutts|Lady Burdett-Coutts]] was "more agreeable", run with "good sense and good will."&lt;ref name="Gay"/&gt;

Most famously, the Prime Minister [[William Ewart Gladstone]] worked directly with fallen women  to try to rescue them from their circumstances. At considerable risk to his political career, Gladstone spent a great amount of his own money and time on this effort, assisted by his wife, [[Catherine Gladstone]]. "There are more entries in Gladstone's diaries about prostitutes than there are about political hostesses, more recorded visits to the fallen women on the streets of London than recorded attendances at the balls and soirées of the ''grandes dames'' of polite Victorian society."&lt;ref&gt;See especially Chapter 6 "Fallen Women" in {{cite book|last=Isba|first=Anne|title=Gladstone and Women|year=2006|publisher=Hambledon Continuum|location=London|isbn=978-1-85285-471-3|pages=115}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rescue work among prostitutes was also part of the missionary work done by the [[Woman's Christian Temperance Union]] (WCTU), whose members also petitioned against alcohol and opium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Tyrrell|first=Ian|title=Woman's World/Woman's Empire: The Woman's Christian temperance Union in International Perspective, 1880–1930|year=1991|publisher=university of North Carolina Press|location=Chapel Hill and London|isbn=978-0-8078-1950-0|pages=110}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a speech to the National Purity Congress in 1895, WCTU temperance campaigner and social reformer [[Jessie Ackermann]] said:

&lt;blockquote&gt;From time immemorial we have read of fallen and outcast women, forms of speech used only in reference to our sex. To my mind the time has now come when we should apply the same term to sinful man ... the great weakness of our rescue work in the past has been its onesidedness. It has busied itself in reclaiming women, while men have been passed by.&lt;ref&gt;Ackermann, Jessie A. "Plan of Work along Social Purity lines" in Aaron Macy Powell ''The National Purity Congress: Its Papers, Addresses, Portraits'' American Purity Alliance, 1st National Purity Congress, Baltimore 1895 reprint Edition 1976 p. 333 by Arno Press {{ISBN|0-405-07474-3}} (for complete set) Sheila Mehlman (Ed.)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

What "amounted to conventional Victorian 'rescue work' for 'fallen' women" was carried out in the Philippines during the [[Philippine–American War]] on behalf of the United States Government as part of a much broader "social purity" campaigns to prohibit prostitution and alcohol and other "social evils".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Tyrrell|first=Ian|title=Reforming the World: The Creation of America's Moral Empire|year=2010|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=Princeton and Oxford|isbn=978-0-691-14521-1|pages=143}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fallen women in art and literature==
As a genuine social concern as well as a metaphor for artistic explorations of vice and virtue, the theme of the fallen woman has a notable place in art and in literature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Seymour-Smith|first=Martin|title=Fallen Women: A Sceptical Enquiry into the Treatment of Prostitutes, their Clients and their Pimps, in Literature|year=1969|publisher=Nelson|location=London|isbn=978-0-586-03477-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some cases, such as [[Dante Gabriel Rossetti]] and [[William Blake]], the artist/author has produced companion pieces in both forms. The theme continues in [[historical fiction]] such as [[John Fowles]]'s ''[[The French Lieutenant's Woman]]''.

What fear I then, rather what know to fear
Under this ignorance of good and evil,
Of God or death, of law or penalty?
Here grows the cure of all, this fruit divine,
Fair to the eye, inviting to the taste,
Of virtue to make wise; what hinders then
To reach, and feed at once both body and mind?"
So saying, her rash hand in evil hour
Forth reaching to the fruit, she pluck'd, she eat.
...
In fruit she never tasted, whether true
Or fancied so, though expectation high
Of knowledge, nor was Godhead from her thought.

}}
Aside from the ''[[Bible]]'', it was [[John Milton]]'s famous and influential poem ''[[Paradise Lost]]'', (1667) that communicated the story of the Fall and its consequences most powerfully. The idea of the fallen woman is most closely related to those sources which represent the fallen woman as an agent, as opposed to a passive receptacle, in the act of her undoing. For example, in "longing to reign rather than serve", Eve is ambitious for knowledge. The difference between these religious renderings of the iconic figure and the fallen woman presented in most 19th century texts is that the latter is suppressed, disempowered, and silenced in her representations: "[T]he Victorian fallen woman is usually depicted ... as a mute, enigmatic icon ... who sleeps through the poem that probes her nature". &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Auerbach|first=Nina|title=Women and the demon |year=1982|publisher=Harvard University Press |chapter=The rise of the fallen woman |page=155 |isbn=978-0-674-95407-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See also {{cite book|last=Watt|first= George|title=Fallen Woman in the Nineteenth-Century Novel|year=1984|publisher=Croom Helm |location=London|isbn=978-0-7099-2781-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Where is honour,
Innate and precept-strengthen'd, 'tis the rock
Of faith connubial: where it is not - where
Light thoughts are lurking, or the vanities
Of worldly pleasure rankle in the heart,
Or sensual throbs convulse it, well I know
'Twere hopeless for humanity to dream
Of honesty in such infected blood,
Although 'twere wed to him it covets most;
An incarnation of the poet's god
In all his marble-chiselled beauty, or
The demi-deity, Alcides, in
His majesty of superhuman manhood,
Would not suffice to bind where virtue is not;
It is consistency which forms and proves it;
Vice cannot fix and virtue cannot change,
The once fall'n woman must forever fall;
For vice must have variety, while virtue
Stands like the sun and all which rolls around
Drinks life, and light, and glory from her aspect.

[[Lord Byron]] uses the idea of the fallen woman to relate vice and virtue and consider the effects of infidelity and inconsistency in his poem ''Mariano Faliero, Doge of Venice''.

Does spring hide its joy
When buds and blossoms grow?
Does the sower
Sow by night,
Or the ploughman in darkness plough?

Break this heavy chain
That does freeze my bones around
Selfish! Vain!
Eternal bane!
That free love with bondage bound.

[[William Blake]]'s series of poems ''[[Songs of Innocence and of Experience]]'' (1789-1794) contrasts the two states in the context of industrialising England, the context in which women became more likely to "fall" as a result of great social change. Blake's poetry explores his deep concern about poverty and its effects as well as the relations between those in authority with those who are controlled by it, including moral generalities and the relations between the sexes. The connections between the Fall of Man and societal restrictions on sexual love are part of those broader concerns.

===Pre-Raphaelite painters===
The theme of the fallen woman was becoming increasingly popular at the time that [[Dante Gabriel Rossetti|Rossetti]] began his picture ''Found''. Conceived in 1851, it was described by Helen Rossetti as follows: "A young drover from the country, while driving a calf to market, recognizes in a fallen woman on the pavement, his former sweetheart. He tries to raise her from where she crouches on the ground, but with closed eyes she turns her face from him to the wall."&lt;ref&gt;Cited in {{cite book|last=Hilton|first=Timothy|title=The Pre-Raphaelites|year=1970|publisher=Harry N. Abrams|location=New York|isbn=978-08109-2036-1|pages=140}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[William Holman Hunt]], like Rossetti a member of the [[Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood]], spent some time searching for a 'suitable' subject for his painting ''[[The Awakening Conscience]]'' and he "found it after reading about [[Peggotty]] and Emily in [[Charles Dickens]]'s novel ''[[David Copperfield (novel)|David Copperfield]]'', and after frequenting the London streets where fallen women could usually be found."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hilton|first=Timothy|title=The Pre-Raphaelites|year=1970|publisher=Harry N. Abrams|location=New York|isbn=978-08109-2036-1|pages=92}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Elizabeth Gaskell===
The character of Esther, who becomes a prostitute in [[Elizabeth Gaskell]]'s novel ''[[Mary Barton]]'' (1848) is an example of a fallen woman being used to illustrate the social and political divide between rich and poor in Victorian England. The novel is set in a large industrial town in the 1840s and it "gives an accurate and humane picture of working-class life ... Esther is presented as something other than merely a bad girl; the abyss into which she falls is the same gulf that separates [[Rich man and Lazarus|Dives from Lazarus]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kettle|first=Arnold|title=The Pelican Guide to English Literature|year=1960|publisher=Penguin Books|location=Middlesex, England|pages=180|editor=Boris Ford|chapter=The Early Victorian Social-Problem Novel}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In terms of the construction of the novel, the conventions of the time required that sexual actions took place offstage or not at all. Readers (particularly female readers) were encouraged to imagine and condemn the actions that caused the character's fall but as with other authors concerned about the effects of poverty on people at the time, especially women, Gaskell's "conscious aim is to bring Christian principles as a mediating force within class antagonisms."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kettle|first=Arnold|title=The Pelican Guide to English Literature|year=1960|publisher=Penguin Books|location=Middlesex, England|pages=179|editor=Boris Ford|chapter=The Early Victorian Social-Problem Novel}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Charles Dickens===
Aside from the well known critiques of society in his novels such as ''David Copperfield'', (1850), Charles Dickens set up and managed Urania Cottage—a home for homeless women. He disagreed with the prevailing idea that once corrupted, especially by prostitution, and therefore fallen, a woman could not be uncorrupted or redeemed. Rather he wanted to treat them well and train them for other employment but he needed to convince his benefactor that it was possible for fallen women to return to mainstream life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hartley|first=Jenny|title=Charles Dickens and the House of Fallen Women|year=2008|publisher=Methuen|location=London|isbn=978-0-413-77643-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Thomas Hardy===
[[Thomas Hardy]]'s novel ''[[Tess of the d'Urbervilles]]'' (1891) explores the consequences for a heroine who became a fallen woman as a result of being raped. This is a key point because the author is trying to show that the consequences are independent of the heroine's actions or intentions.

==Fallen women in film==
In cinema, the fallen woman is one of the earliest representatives of the female prostitute, and the theme had great appeal during the [[Silent film|silent era]].&lt;ref name=Campbell&gt;{{cite web|last=Campbell |first=Russell |title='Fallen woman' prostitute narratives in the cinema |url=http://www.latrobe.edu.au/screeningthepast/firstrelease/fr1199/rcfr8b.htm |year=1999 |publisher=LaTrobe University |accessdate=2011-12-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110308080040/http://www.latrobe.edu.au/screeningthepast/firstrelease/fr1199/rcfr8b.htm |archivedate=2011-03-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; By the mid 20th century, when women had access to a variety of jobs and their sexual activity was no longer necessarily associated with moral corruption, the fallen woman as a theme was no longer relevant. The films sometimes intended to convey a moral lesson; sometimes they were a social commentary on poverty; sometimes they explored the idea of redemption or the consequences of coercion; and sometimes they were about self-sacrifice. These contrasts, such as innocence and experience; sin and redemption; vice and virtue, as well as ideas about corruption, class, exploitation, suffering and punishment, build on themes in earlier literature. Some films, such as ''[[The Red Kimona]]'' (1925) &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0016276/ IMDb tt0016276 The Red Kimono]&lt;/ref&gt; in which the fallen woman was allowed to live happily at the end, were subject to severe censorship.&lt;ref name=Campbell/&gt; ''[[The Road to Ruin (1928 film)|The Road to Ruin]]'' (1928)&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0019332/ IMDb tt0019332 The Road to Ruin]&lt;/ref&gt; was banned. ''Protect Us'' (1914)
&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0004500/ IMDb tt0004500 Protect Us]&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[The Primrose Path (film)|The Primrose Path]]'' (1931)&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0022278/ IMDb tt0022278 The Primrose Path]&lt;/ref&gt; are films that emphasize the fault of the woman. ''[[The Jungle (1914 film)|The Jungle]]'' (1914)&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0004182/ IMDb tt0004182 The Jungle]&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[Damaged Goods (1919 film)|Damaged Goods]]'' (1919)&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0260839/ IMDb tt0260839 Damaged Goods]&lt;/ref&gt;  consider the element of coercion, whereas poverty is important in ''Out of the Night'' (1918),&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0009468/ IMDb tt0009468 Out of the Night]&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Painted Lady]]'' (1924),&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0015208/ IMDb tt0015208T he Painted Lady]&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[Joyless Street|Die freudlose Gasse]]'' (''Joyless Street'', 1925), the latter film directed by [[G. W. Pabst]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0015842/ IMDb tt0015842 Die freudlose Gasse (Joyless Street)]&lt;/ref&gt;

Nombre de personnes âgées de cinq ans et plus déclarant savoir lire et écrire le français, d’après les données du recensement de 2008 communiquées par l’[[Office national des statistiques d’Algérie]]."&lt;/ref&gt; Despite intermittent attempts to eradicate French from public life, by the 2000s there were far more French speakers in Algeria than on the eve of independence in 1962.&lt;ref name="RocheronRolfe2004"/&gt;

==History==
During the French colonisation from 1830 to 1962, according to Benrabah, French "symbolized foreign exploitation and was thus to be resisted" but that "it served as a tool to raise the population's awareness and support in favour of such resistance" because French conveyed "universal values" of liberty, equality, and fraternity.&lt;ref name="BenrabahMaint194" /&gt; During the colonial period, about one million French native speakers lived in Algeria. The pied-noirs developed a distinctive dialect, termed [[Pataouète]]. In 1963, of the 1,300,000 literate people in Algeria, 1 million read French. Of the total population, 6 million spoke French.&lt;ref name="BenrabahMaint194" /&gt;

In the 1960s, post-independence Algerian politicians intended to carry out an Arabization campaign to replace the usage of French with Modern Standard Arabic.&lt;ref&gt;Benrabah "Language maintenance and spread: French in Algeria", p. 193-194.&lt;/ref&gt; The Algerian government taught French as the first mandatory foreign language for students beginning in the fourth grade in the primary cycle, from the end of the 1970s to the early 1990s. In September 1993 the [[Ministry of Primary and Secondary Education (Algeria)|Ministry of Primary and Secondary Education]] made French and English two separate choices for the first mandatory foreign language; students were required to pick one over the other; the great majority of students selected French as their first mandatory foreign language.&lt;ref name="BenrabahMaint194" /&gt; Opponents of French-Arabic bilingualism in Algeria argued that French was a colonialist and imperialist language.&lt;ref name="BenrabahMaint194" /&gt; A report for the High Council of Francophonie in Paris stated in 1986 that in Algeria, 150,000 people spoke French as a first language and 6.5 million spoke French as a second language. The total population of Algeria at the time was 21 million.&lt;ref&gt;Meisler, Stanley. "[http://articles.latimes.com/1986-03-01/news/mn-13048_1_french-language Seduction Still Works : French--a Language in Decline]." ''[[Los Angeles Times]]''. March 1, 1986. Retrieved on May 18, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

Benrabah said that "[f]rom a quantitative point of view, today's Algeria is the second largest French-speaking community in the world" and that "Arabization, or the language policy implemented to displace French altogether, failed."&lt;ref name="BenrabahMaint194" /&gt; In 1990, 6,650,000 people in Algeria spoke French, with 150,000 being native speakers and 6,500,000 being second-language speakers.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}} In 1993, of 27.3 million people in Algeria, 49% spoke French. At the time, studies predicted that 67% of the Algerian population would speak French by 2003.&lt;ref name="BenrabahMaint194" /&gt; The Abassa Institute polled 1,400 Algerian households in April 2000 about their language use. Of them, 60% spoke and/or understood the French language. The institute used its findings to represent the 14 million Algerian citizens who were of the age 16 or older.&lt;ref name="BenrabahMaint194" /&gt; Benrabah said that the polls confirm the trend of French increasing in Algeria.&lt;ref name="BenrabahMaint194" /&gt;

Maamri said that in 2009, due to the advent of satellite television channels that carry Francophone entertainment, the language "is now enjoying something of a revival."&lt;ref name=Maamri1013/&gt; She added that "Also over the years, the Algerian government has pushed back, reintroducing French."&lt;ref name=Maamri1013/&gt;

In 2014, 76% of [[Facebook]] users in Algeria posted in French, while 32% posted in Arabic. In 2016 68% used Facebook in French, while 43% used it in Arabic.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.arabsocialmediareport.com/UserManagement/PDF/ASMR6_En_Final.pdf Citizen Engagement and Public Servicesin the Arab World: The Potential of Social Media]" (6th Edition).

The choice of language of Algerian leaders in public reflects their language policy: [[Houari Boumédiène]], second president of Algeria from 1965 to 1978, was strongly against French and never used it publicly.&lt;ref name="RocheronRolfe2004"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Yvette Rocheron|author2=Christopher Rolfe|title=Shifting Frontiers of France and Francophonie|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=v7IZd9Pr_AYC&amp;pg=PA49|date=1 January 2004|publisher=Peter Lang|isbn=978-3-906768-31-1|pages=49–59}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Chadli Bendjedid]], third president of the country, used only [[classical Arabic]] in his speeches, as did [[Liamine Zéroual]]. Other political leaders, such as [[Mohamed Boudiaf]] and the current president [[Abdelaziz Bouteflika]], had a more favourable attitude towards French. Bouteflika in particular believed that the Francophone dimension of Algeria was evident in the impact of thinkers such as [[Descartes]] and the parallels between the [[French Revolution|French]] and [[Algerian revolution]]s.&lt;ref name="RocheronRolfe2004"/&gt;

The '''Girango people''' (also known as '''JoSuba''' or '''Joka-Kombe''') is a group of [[Luo people]] who fall in the group known as [[Acholi|Joka Jok]]. They include the [[Suna people|Suna]]/[[Suba people (Kenya)|Suba]], [[Wategi]]/Kamagambo-Kanying'ombe, [[Wagire]], [[JoKasgunga]], [[JoSidho]], [[JoKabar]], [[JoMur]], [[JoKiseru]] etc. They migrated to [[Kenya]] from northern [[Uganda]], and are believed to be the brothers of the Simbiti. However, the Simbiti were absorbed into [[Kuria (ethnic group)|Kuria]] community, and that is why the people of Kuria have diverse origins. Some historians tend to use the ''Bunchari'' dialect of the Kuria spoken by the [[Simbiti]], as well as the Kuria culture followed by the Simbiti to discuss the Girango people.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14873">{{Politics of Haiti}}
According to its [[Constitution of Haiti|Constitution]] and written laws, [[Haiti]] meets most international [[human rights]] standards. In practice, many provisions are not respected. The [[Government of Haiti|government]]'s human rights record is poor. Political killings, [[kidnapping]], [[torture]], and unlawful incarceration are common unofficial practices, especially during periods of [[coup]]s or attempted coups.

==History==

The land that would become [[Haiti]] was first colonized by Spain at the end of the 15th century. The Spanish essentially wiped out the native [[Taíno]] people through slavery and smallpox, to which the Taíno had no immunity. An early defender of more humane treatment of the Taíno was the Spanish priest [[Bartolomé de Las Casas]]. Albeit too late to save the Taíno, Las Casas was able to persuade the Spanish government that the Taíno could not withstand such cruel treatment. This had the tragic side effect of the importation of African slaves to replace the labor of the diminishing Taíno.

Initially, Las Casas believed Africans to be suitable for slavery, but he later came to oppose their enslavement too. "I soon repented and judged myself guilty of ignorance. I came to realize that black slavery was as unjust as Indian slavery...and I was not sure that my ignorance and good faith would secure me in the eyes of God," Las Casas wrote in ''The History of the Indies'' in 1527.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The History of Father Bartolomé de las Casas |url=http://www.colonialzone-dr.com/people_history-Las%20Casas.html |publisher=Colonial Zone-Dominican Republic |accessdate=14 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1697, Spain formally ceded to France control of the part of the island of Hispaniola that would become Haiti, naming it [[Saint-Domingue]]. Slavery in Saint-Domingue, France's most lucrative colony, was known to be especially brutal, with a complete turnover of the slave population due to death every 20 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=History of Haiti |author=U.S. Library of Congress |url=http://www.nationsonline.org/oneworld/History/Haiti-history.htm |publisher=Nations Online Project |accessdate=14 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the historian Laurent Dubois, between 5 and 10 percent of slaves died every year due to overwork and disease, a rate that outpaced births. The dead were replaced by new slaves from Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book  |last1=Dubois |first1=Laurent |title=Haiti: The Aftershocks of History |date=January 2012 |publisher=Henry Holt and Company |location=New York |url=http://us.macmillan.com/haititheaftershocksofhistory/LaurentDubois |isbn=978-0-8050-9335-3 |page=21 |edition=First |accessdate=14 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1791, what would become known as the [[Haitian Revolution]] began. Predominantly a slave revolt, Haitians finally won their freedom and independence from France in 1804.

In 1825,  France's King Charles X threatened to invade Haiti unless it paid an "independence debt" of 150 million francs to reimburse France for the loss of its slaves and land. The debt was later reduced to 90 million francs but it was not until 1947 that Haiti had paid off what many have regarded as an immoral and illegal debt. To pay this, Haiti had to borrow money from and pay interest to French banks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=MacDonald |first1=Isabel |title=France's Debt of Dishonour to Haiti |url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/cifamerica/2010/aug/16/haiti-france |accessdate=14 July 2014 |work=The Guardian |location=UK |date=16 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"We're talking about 200 hundred years of this cycle of debt that Haiti has gone through, which of course has devastating consequences on the capacity of the state within the country,"  Haiti historian Laurent Dubois has said.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Dubois |first1=Laurent |title=The Haitian Revolution (video) |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fll-z1oUfyo |publisher=YouTube |date=22 February 2013 |accessdate=14 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The country's poverty made it vulnerable throughout its history to political instability and human rights abuses both by Haitian state officials and foreign interventions.

In 1915, following a coup that led to the mob killing of Haitian President Vibrun Guillaume Sam, United States sailors and marines landed in order to protect U.S. interests in the country. The occupation would last until 1934.  "Following restoration of order, a treaty providing for United States control over Haitian finances, customs, police, public works, sanitation, and medical services were concluded with the client Haitian government," according to the Navy Department Library.&lt;ref name=USOccupationOfHaiti&gt;{{cite web |title=US Occupation of Haiti, 1915–1934 |url=http://www.history.navy.mil/library/online/haiti_main.htm |publisher=U.S. Navy Department Library |accessdate=14 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the occupation roads and other public works projects were built by the [[corvée]] labor—forced, [[unpaid work]]—of Haitian peasants.&lt;ref name=USOccupationOfHaiti/&gt;

In 1916, the U.S. military started a Haitian army that would later become the Garde d'Haiti.&lt;ref name=USOccupationOfHaiti/&gt; Beginning with the [[Caco Wars]], during the US occupation, and continuing until the 1990s, the Haitian army was implicated in a number of human rights abuses against the Haitian people. For example, following a 1991 coup by the military that overthrew democratically elected President [[Jean-Bertrand Aristide]], the Haitian army was accused of killing an estimated 3,000 people in three years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Nielsen |first1=Kirk |title=As Haiti Disbands Army, Soldiers Are Retooled for Scarce Civilian Jobs |url=http://www.csmonitor.com/1995/1211/11081.html |accessdate=14 July 2014|work=The Christian Science Monitor |date=11 December 1995}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon his return to the presidency, Aristide disbanded the army.

===Duvalier period===
In 1957, [[François Duvalier]], also known as "Papa Doc", became president of Haiti, ushering in a period of human rights abuses from which the country is still recovering. An estimated 30,000–60,000 people&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Dubois |first1=Laurent |title=Haiti: The Aftershocks of History |url=http://us.macmillan.com/haititheaftershocksofhistory/LaurentDubois |date=2012 |publisher=Henry Holt and Company, LLC |isbn=978-0-8050-9335-3|page=326 |edition=First  |accessdate=July 22, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; were killed in the 30 years Haiti was under the rule of Duvalier and his son—and successor—[[Jean-Claude Duvalier]], also known as "Baby Doc".

In 1959, François Duvalier formed a paramilitary force&lt;ref name=COHA-March2010&gt;{{cite web |title=The Tonton Macoutes: the Central Nervous System of Haiti's Reign of Terror |url=http://www.coha.org/tonton-macoutes/ |publisher=Council on Hemispheric Affairs|date=March 11, 2010 |accessdate=July 22, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; known as the [[Tonton Macoute]], named after a mythic Haitian character who kidnapped misbehaving children, carried them off in a bag and ate them for breakfast. Duvalier authorized more than 10,000 Tonton Macoute, organized in 500 sections across the country, to maintain complete control over the population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Hallward |first1=Peter |title=Damming the Flood: Haiti, Aristide and the Politics of Containment |url=http://www.versobooks.com/books/524-damming-the-flood | date=2007 |publisher=Verso |location=London |isbn=978-1-84467-106-9 |page=14 |edition=First |accessdate=July 22, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; "The macoutes were Papa Doc's version of brownshirts and the Waffen SS, except that their usual uniform was blue jeans, T-shirts, sunglasses, and they carried clubs or pistols," wrote journalist and author [[Herbert Gold]] in ''Best Nightmare on Earth: A Life in Haiti''. "They were loyal only to Papa Doc. In return, they could rob, steal, extort, torture and murder at will."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last1=Gold |first1=Herbert |title=Best Nightmare on Earth: A Life in Haiti |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zlVqAAAAMAAJ |date=1991 |publisher=Prentice Hall Press |location=New York |isbn=0-13-372327-5 |pages=125–126 |edition=First}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Tonton Macoute continued to openly terrorize the population until they were officially disbanded after Jean-Claude Duvalier was forced from the presidency and went into exile in 1986.&lt;ref name=COHA-March2010/&gt;

==Law and order==
The government in Haiti is known for running a slow, inefficient and [[Government of Haiti#Corruption|corrupt]] system of justice. Allegations of torture and kidnapping are common whereas the number of Haitian citizens imprisoned without trial is huge.

Lawyers' immunity is under constant threat. Under the [[Duvalier]] regime, lawyers were intimidated from defending their clients through pressure and violence. Courts of justice were in effect "run by the judges, appointed by the "President for Life" (the Duvaliers), who lacked the independence to make judgments about abuses against human rights."&lt;ref&gt;"Entry on 'Haiti' ", p.652, ''Encyclopedia of Human Rights'', by Edward H. Lawson, Mary Lou Bertucci, Laurie S. Wiseberg. 2nd Edition (revised), Taylor and Francis, 1996, {{ISBN|1-56032-362-0}}, {{ISBN|978-1-56032-362-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt; To this day, there is still no guarantee for lawyers' immunity in Haiti, as would seem to be suggested by the 2009 unconstitutional arrest without [[warrant (law)|warrant]] of human-rights defender, Osner Fevry&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.metropolehaiti.com/metropole/full_poli_fr.php?id=15254 "L'avocat Osner Févry, incarcéré sur ordre du chef du Parquet"], Radio Metropole, 23 May 2009. Retrieved 12 June 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; and the arrest in 2013 of Andre Michel, a lawyer critical of the government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Charles |first1=Jacqueline |title=Arrest of Haiti government critic triggers protests |url=http://www.miamiherald.com/2013/10/23/3707066/haiti-erupts-into-protests-burning.html |work=Miami Herald |accessdate=11 July 2014 |date=23 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prolonged pretrial detention==

Although the Constitution mandates an independent [[judiciary]] and the right to a fair trial, prolonged pretrial detention remains a serious problem. Because the court system and its records are poorly organized, it is impossible to determine the exact percentage of prisoners being held without trial. A study by the International Centre for Prison Studies, in partnership with the University of Essex, estimated that in 2013 nearly 71 percent of 9,921 prisoners in Haiti had not had a trial yet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Haiti country report |publisher=International Centre for Prison Studies (ICPS) |url=http://www.prisonstudies.org/country/haiti |accessdate=9 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the Centre, the majority of countries in the world have percentages ranging between 10 and 40 percent of such prisoners and Haiti's estimated 71 percent is one of the highest in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Close to three million people in pre-trial detention worldwide, new report shows |publisher=International Centre for Prison Studies (ICPS) |url=http://www.prisonstudies.org/news/close-three-million-people-pre-trial-detention-worldwide-new-report-shows |date=18 June 2014 |accessdate=9 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Freedom of expression==
{{Further|Media of Haiti}}
The Constitution guarantees [[freedom of speech]] and the [[freedom of the press|press]], and the government generally has respected these rights. Many journalists, however, practice a measure of [[self-censorship]] in order to protect themselves from retribution. During the [[Jean-Bertrand Aristide#Second presidency (2001–2004)|second Aristide administration (2000–4)]], some reports contend that members of the press were killed for supporting opposition movements.{{citation needed|date=May 2008}}

The government does not [[censorship|censor]] radio, television, or the Internet. Because demonstrations often turn violent, security forces frequently have ignored the constitutionally mandated right to [[freedom of assembly|assembly]] and organization. The Haitian government generally has respected [[religious freedom]] in the country.

==Gender, disability, race and language==
{{see also|Sexual violence in Haiti|Women's rights in Haiti}}
Haiti's Constitution does not contain specific language prohibiting discrimination on the basis of [[racial discrimination|race]], [[gender discrimination|sex]], [[language discrimination|language]], [[age discrimination|age]], or [[disability discrimination|disability]]. Although some working standards exist to protect women, few resources exist to ensure enforcement. Abuses against women and children are common. Rape, although illegal, rarely results in prosecution of the perpetrator. Haitian law (article 269) excuses a husband for murdering his wife if the wife is found in an adulterous affair. Wives do not enjoy the same right.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.violenceisnotourculture.org/index.php?q=node/12 "Frequently Asked Questions About 'Honour Killing' "], Violence is not our culture. Retrieved 15 July 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Haitian government contains a Ministry of Women's Affairs, but it also lacks the resources to address issues such as violence against women and harassment in the workplace.

==Children==
In addition to suffering from [[malnutrition|chronic malnourishment]] and a lack of educational opportunity, many Haitian children also suffer physical abuse. In 2004 the Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs reported that its hotline received more than 700 calls from children reporting abuse.{{citation needed|date=May 2008}} Few statistics regarding the wider problem of [[child abuse]] have been collected. [[Trafficking of children]] also is a significant problem.{{citation needed|date=May 2008}} [[UNICEF]] estimates that 2,000 to 3,000 Haitian children per year are trafficked to the Dominican Republic.{{citation needed|date=May 2008}}

The '''Independent Corrupt Practices Commission''' (ICPC), (in full the Independent Corrupt Practices and Other Related Offences Commission) is a [[Nigeria]]n agency that was inaugurated on 29 September 2000 following the recommendation of President [[Olusegun Obasanjo]]. The mandate is to receive and investigate reports of corruption and in appropriate cases prosecute the offender(s), to examine, review and enforce the correction of corruption prone systems and procedures of public bodies, with a view to eliminating corruption in public life, and to educate and enlighten the public on and against corruption and related offences with a view to enlisting and fostering public support for the fight against corruption.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Relationship with other organizations==

In 2003, the [[Economic and Financial Crimes Commission]] (EFCC) was established as a law enforcement agency to investigate financial crimes such as [[advance fee fraud]] (419 fraud) and [[money laundering]].&lt;ref name="establishment"&gt;{{cite news
 |url          = http://www.efccnigeria.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=12&amp;Itemid=30

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
While the ICPC targets corruption in the public sector, especially bribery, gratification, graft, and abuse or misuse of office, the EFCC investigates people in all sectors who appear to be living above their means, and is empowered to investigate and prosecute money laundering and other financial crimes. The EFCC tracks illicit wealth accruing from abuse of office, especially attempts to integrate such wealth into the financial system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
There have been tensions between the two commissions. The ICPC chairman, Justice Emmanuel Ayoola, has complained about duplication of the functions of ICPC by the EFCC, particularly overlap between the ICPC Anti-Corruption and Transparency Monitoring Units and the EFCC Anti-Corruption and Transparency Committees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The [[Association of Certified Anti-Money Laundering Specialists]] (ACAMS) is a global organization of professionals dedicated to controlling and preventing money laundering and [[terrorist financing]]. In June 2009, ACAMS established a Nigerian chapter in [[Lagos]]. The Chairman of the ICPC, Justice Emmanuel Ayoola, said the ICPC was looking forward to a fruitful partnership with ACAMS in the campaign against corruption and all other related crimes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.acams.org/Chapters/resources/The%20Guardian%20(Nigeria)%206-25-09.pdf |title=ICPC, EFCC chiefs, others task anti-money laundering body on service |author=Bola Olajuwon |date=25 June 2009 |publisher=The Guardian |accessdate=2009-10-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091222063208/http://www.acams.org/Chapters/resources/The%20Guardian%20%28Nigeria%29%206-25-09.pdf |archivedate=22 December 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The commission works with other international bodies such as the [[United Nations]] Committee on Anti-Corruption (UNCAC), [[Transparency International]], and the [[African Union]] (AU) Convention Against Corruption.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

In September 2009, a Federal High Court judge refused a request to issue a {{lang|la|[[writ of mandamus|mandamus]]}} order compelling the ICPC and the EFCC to investigate and prosecute the [[Federal Capital Territory (Nigeria)|FCT]] Minister, Senator [[Adamu Aliero]], over alleged diversion of N10.2&amp;nbsp;billion public funds while he held office as Kebbi State governor. The court explained it did not have authority to compel the agencies to act.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==2009 Review of mandate==

In June 2009 the Senate Committee on Drugs, Narcotics and Anti-Corruption  moved to amend the Acts setting up the ICPC and the EFCC so as to guarantee independence from the executive. Two of the proposals were to give the EFCC Chair a legally stipulated tenure of four years, and to require Senate approval for removal of members of either commission.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

 |title=More Autonomy for EFCC, ICPC
 |date=17 June 2009
 |accessdate=2009-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;
A merger of the two agencies was also considered. At public hearings on the amendments, Senate President [[David Mark]] expressed concern that the EFCC and the ICPC would have too much power without another body supervising their work. However, the EFCC Chairman, [[Farida Waziri]] said it was important for anti-corruption agencies to remain independent of politicians, whom they often investigated. She expressed concern that the proposed amendment would rather limit than enhance the effectiveness of the agencies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Prosecutions==

In the first three years of its existence, the ICPC received a total of 942 petitions. In August 2003 about 400 of the petitions were under investigation, and about 60 were at various stages of prosecution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
 |url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1G1-107102553.html

 |publisher=This Day
 |accessdate=2009-10-12}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;
After the first four years, however, the ICPC had failed to make any major convictions. Justice Akanbi blamed the lack of progress in part on severe underfunding, in part on the fact that the commission was not authorized to investigate corrupt activity prior to the date the ICPC was founded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The ICPC has prosecuted a number of prominent Nigerians. Some examples are [[Ghali Umar Na'Abba]], speaker of the House of Representatives (2002), [[Fabian Osuji]], head of  the [[Nigerian Federal Ministry of Education]] (2006).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

In June 2004, Justice Mustapha Akanbi said that although several petitions had been written against state governors, the ICPC was not empowered to investigate governors involved in corrupt practices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

 |author=Lillian Okenwa
 |accessdate=2009-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;
However, in August 2008 Emmanuel Ayoola said the commission would soon issue a list of former state governors found to have violated the provisions of the ICPC Act 2000. He noted that some of them were already being prosecuted for money laundering, and said the ICPC was  scrutinising the file to see whether there are cases they could pursue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

In August 2009 the ICPC started investigations into an alleged N90 billion fraud leveled against managers of Pension Fund for retirees in the health sector.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

In March 2015, ICPC made public the status of criminal cases within its precinct as at March 2015. The list contained 267 criminal cases between 2001 and 2015, and 142 civil cases between 2007 and 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://icpc.gov.ng/downloads/?did=63|title = Status of Criminal and Civil Cases as at March 2015|date = 7 April 2015|access-date = |website = Independent Corrupt Practices and Other Related Offences Commission|publisher = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversies==

===Theft is not corruption===

The Chairman Ekpo Nta narrowed the meaning of [[corruption]] by government officials:
"Stealing is erroneously reported as corruption. We must go back to what we were taught at school to show that there are educated people in Nigeria. We must address issues as we were taught in school to do."
.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Nigerian Politicians are Thieves, But They are Not Corrupt|url=http://www.punchng.com/news/stealing-is-not-corruption-says-icpc/|access-date=27 August 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141108001505/http://www.punchng.com/news/stealing-is-not-corruption-says-icpc/#|archive-date=8 November 2014|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It followed the previous similar announcement by the [[Goodluck Jonathan|Nigerian President Goodluck]]:
"What many Nigerians refer to as corruption is actually stealing.  Stealing is not the same thing as corruption." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Nigerian Politicians are Thieves, But They are Not Corrupt|url=http://www.vanguardngr.com/2014/07/nigerian-politicians-thieves-corrupt/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''Internationalist Review''''' is an independent, non-profit e-journal founded on July 3, 2006, in [[Maastricht]], [[Netherlands]]. The IR wants to be in its own words "a reader-friendly guide to news sources from around the world". Its aim is to overcome the national partition of the public sphere and create an [[public space|"espace publique mondial"]]. The style of publications is clearly inspired by academic methods and standards. 

The first board of directors of the Internationalist Review Foundation consisted of seven members, including five different nationalities. The first published dossier dealt with the [[First Employment Contract|anti-CPE crisis]] in France. An on-line Review was maintained until 2008. The organisation is registered as a non-profit foundation under Dutch law at the Chamber of Commerce in [[The Hague]] and under Belgian law in [[Brussels]] (registry number 0879.791.987). 

Since 2008, the Internationalist Review Foundation (or simply Internationalist Foundation) diversified its activities, notably by organising the [[European Master Thesis Award]] in cooperation with [[Maastricht University]] and the large-scale research project [[INFOCON]], financed under the Seventh Framework Programme for Research and Development of the [[European Commission]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5130">'''''Jilt shop''''' is an archaic term for an establishment frequented by [[Bargirl|B-girls]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bergen|first1=Philip|title=Old Boston in Early Photographs, 1850-1918: 174 Prints from the Collection of the Bostonian Society|date=1990|publisher=Courier Corporation|isbn=9780486261843|page=23|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-kKG0CWT9BgC&amp;pg=PA23&amp;dq=jilt#v=onepage&amp;q=jilt&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
''Jilt'' originally meant "harlot" or "woman who gives hope then dashes it"; ''to jilt'' meant "to deceive (especially after holding out hopes), cheat, trick."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Jilt|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=jilt|website=Online Etymology Dictionary|accessdate=22 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[William Wycherley]]'s ''Love in the Wood'' (1671), II.i.141, Sir Simon complains of a "Mistress of mine...whom I treated to night at the French-house; but as soon as the Jilt had eat up my meat, and drank her two bottles, she run away from me."&lt;ref name="williams"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Williams|first1=Gordon|title=A Dictionary of Sexual Language and Imagery in Shakespearean and Stuart Literature|date=2001|publisher=A&amp;C Black|isbn=9780485113938|page=739|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2XtWDhgljvkC&amp;pg=PA739}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 19th century, [[George W. Matsell]] defined "jilt" as "a prostitute who hugs and kisses a countryman while her accomplice robs him."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Matsell|first1=George W.|title=Vocabulum: Or, The Rogue's Lexicon. Comp. from the Most Authentic Sources|date=1859|publisher=University of Michigan|page=46|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=07NZAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA46}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[North Street (Boston)#Ann Street in the 19th century|Ann Street]], Boston's [[red-light district]] in the 19th century, was lined with "jilt shops"—saloons, dance halls, gambling dens, and brothels—whose primary purpose was to lure customers for robbery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ferraiuolo|first1=Augusto|title=Religious Festive Practices in Boston's North End: Ephemeral Identities in an Italian American Community|date=2012|publisher=SUNY Press|isbn=9781438428147|page=43|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iDvrd9qTRF0C&amp;pg=PA43}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An example of a jilt shop in operation is described in an 1881 ''[[The Boston Globe|Boston Globe]]'' article. A man named Gideon Burnham entered a small saloon in the [[North End, Boston|North End]] where, by his account, he attempted to pay for his drink with a $5 bill. The barmaid, Mary McNamara, said she could not make change but could get change across the street. After she left the saloon, Burnham was advised to follow her and retrieve his money before she spent it all on drink. As soon as he left the saloon, the door was locked behind him. Burnham found a police officer and had McNamara arrested for larceny. In court, McNamara and "the woman who keeps the jilt shop" told a different story, claiming that "instead of larceny there was only a breach of an illegal contract"; meaning, presumably, that Burnham had paid for sexual services which were not rendered. "The court intimated that there was very little difference between stealing and cheating, and preferred to believe the man's story, more particularly as it was the business of such women to cheat people and steal money in the way described." McNamara was fined $20 and costs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The Mirror of City Life|url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/boston/doc/492425701.html?FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:AI&amp;type=historic&amp;date=Nov+24%2C+1881&amp;author=&amp;pub=Boston+Daily+Globe+%281872-1922%29&amp;desc=THE+MIRROR+OF+CITY+LIFE.|newspaper=The Boston Globe|date=November 24, 1881}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In another instance, two female employees of a jilt shop were arrested in 1882 for stealing $250 from the pockets of Charles Tasker, a former North End police officer who "ought to have been wise enough to keep out of the snares of strange women."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The Mirror of City Life|url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/boston/doc/492427242.html?FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:AI&amp;type=historic&amp;date=Jan+25%2C+1882&amp;author=&amp;pub=Boston+Daily+Globe+%281872-1922%29&amp;desc=THE+MIRROR+OF+CITY+LIFE.|newspaper=The Boston Globe|date=January 25, 1882}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A popular form of entertainment at jilt shops was [[rat-baiting]]. In the saloon above the rat-pit, drinks were served by provocatively dressed women who were paid a small fee by the owners, in addition to whatever they collected by various means from the customers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cole|first1=William|last2=Woods|first2=Robert, ed.|title=Americans in Process: A Settlement Study|date=1903|publisher=Houghton, Mifflin|pages=192&amp;ndash;194|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=atYJAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA192}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Members of Koi community.jpg|thumb|The men who feature in this photograph belong to the hunter gatherer tribe which is called as Koya or Koi community. As they started coming into contact with the other forward communities, there are many changes in their life style. They speak a language called Koya which does not have any script and has very limited number of words. To cater to their communication requirements of the modern age they borrowed many Telugu words and even use Telugu script to write in their language.]]

'''Koya''' a scheduled tribal community habituated southern part of India. Koyas are commonly referred to as Koi, Koyalu, Koyollu, KoyaDoralu, Dorala Sattam, etc. Koya tribes can be further divided into Koya, Doli Koya, Gutta Koya or Gotti Koya, Kammara Koya, Musara Koya, Oddi Koya, Pattidi Koya, Rasha Koya, Lingadhari Koya (ordinary), Kottu Koya, Bhine Koya,.Raja Koya, etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=THE CONSTITUTION OF INDIA(SCHEDULED TRIBES)ORDER, 1950(C.O. 22)|url=http://lawmin.nic.in/ld/subord/rule9a.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=TribalWelfareDept&gt;{{cite web|title=Portal of Tribal welfare Department, Govt of AP|url=http://www.aptribes.gov.in/html/tcr-studies-eci-koya.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; Koyas call themselves "Koitur" in their dialect. Koyas speaks Koya language, also known as koya basha, and is a member of the [[Dravidian languages|Dravidian language]] family.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Language and culture|url=http://www.aptribes.gov.in/html/tcr-culture.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Population &amp; Livelihood ==

The Koya population is mostly spread out in the southern region of India, particularly in the states of [[Telangana|Telengana]], [[Chhattisgarh]], [[Madhya Pradesh]], [[Karnataka]], [[Odisha]],  [[Andhra Pradesh]] and in Lakshadweep islands

.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=State/Union Territory-wise list of Scheduled Tribes in India|url=http://tribal.nic.in/WriteReadData/CMS/Documents/201306030201065184795StatewiseListofScheduledTribe.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Andhra Pradesh, they live especially in West Godavari, East Godavari, Khammam and Warangal districts and are sparsely found in Adilabad and Karimnagar districts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Brief Ethnographic Profile of Tribes of Andhra Pradesh|url=http://www.aptribes.gov.in/bsethno.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Koya are second the largest populated tribe of Andhra Pradesh with the population of 568,019 (11.3%) in total ST population according to the census of 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=THE SCHEDULED TRIBES  Census of India 2001|url=http://censusindia.gov.in/Tables_Published/SCST/dh_st_andhra.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Koya are mainly settled cultivators and artisans, expertise in making  bamboo furniture including mats for fencing, dust pans, and baskets.They grow Jowar, Ragi, Bajra and other millets. Tubers and roots such as Tella Chenna Gadda, Kirismatilu and edible green leaves such as Chencheli, Doggali, Gumuru, bacchalakura, gongura, pacchakura, pullakusiru, Thota kura, Boddukura are dietary staples as are curries made from some of these ingredients.&lt;ref name="TribalWelfareDept" /&gt;

== Displacement of tribal communities ==

The tribal community faces the new threats of development and conflicts, posing a serious questions on its existence and civilization. For instance, the displacement and migration of Gotti koyas tribals taking place in Andhra Pradesh. In the absence of land and access to a forest, the Koyas depend on wage labour in farm lands. The scarcity of these jobs lead to malnutrition of children and instances of [[anemia]] in women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Severe malnutrition among migrant Gotti Koya children|url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/severe-malnutrition-among-migrant-gotti-koya-children/article3213079.ece|date=March 24, 2012|work=The Hindu|accessdate=March 24, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Andhra Pradesh state government proposed [[Polavaram Project]] is posing a serious threat of displacement of 170,275 Koyas of the tribal population and more than 276 villages in the [[Khammam]] district of [[Bhadrachalam]], [[Palwancha]] divisions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Tribal villages face threat of submersion|url=http://www.newindianexpress.com/cities/hyderabad/article436793.ece#.UvsaQvmSzec|date=16 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Stop Acquisition of Tribal Land for the Construction of Polavaram Dam, INDIA|url=http://acpp.org/uappeals/2009/09120409.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
[[Kyle Broflovski]] grows increasingly irritated at [[Eric Cartman]]'s habit of having indiscreet phone conversations while using the [[speakerphone]] function of his phone. When he complains about this to Cartman, Cartman accuses Kyle of invading his privacy, and comes to suspect that Kyle is an agent of the [[National Security Agency]] (NSA), which Cartman believes is tracking the movements of American citizens. When [[Butters Stotch]] learns this, he begins worshipping the government.

Cartman acquires a new [[social media]] device called Shitter, which is being advertised on TV by [[Alec Baldwin]]. The device broadcasts a user's thoughts audibly and sends them directly to the Internet without the use of a phone. Cartman decides to use this device while infiltrating the NSA in order to broadcast his thoughts to the Internet. Meanwhile, Butters goes to a Colorado [[Department of Motor Vehicles]] office and confesses his sins to the person behind the counter. He is subsequently visited by two [[Jehovah's Witnesses]]. Butters shares with them the truth about the government and the three of them begin sharing DMV literature with their neighbors. Eventually, others begin showing up at the DMV to confess their sins.

Cartman goes to the NSA headquarters impersonating a job applicant under the name [[Bill Clinton]]. The NSA chief hires him to help monitor emails and phone conversations. Cartman is irritated to learn that he himself is not being monitored by the NSA and tries unsuccessfully to convince the chief that Eric Cartman is really a threat. The chief explains that the NSA cannot change someone's status in the Central Computer. When Cartman questions this, the chief reveals the mechanism by which the NSA monitors citizens: they have [[Santa Claus]] imprisoned and hooked up to their computers. Cartman then reveals his true identity, telling the chief that he will inform the public of the truth.

Cartman is subsequently heartbroken to learn that nobody cares that the NSA is monitoring them. He is consoled by Butters, who convinces him to join the group at the DMV.

==Critical reception==
Max Nicholson of [[IGN]] gave the episode a score of 6.7 out of 10, saying that "the beginning of 'Let Go, Let Gov' featured the best jokes from this storyline" and that "as the arc progressed, the episode veered more and more into preachy territory."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Nicholson|first=Max|title=South Park: "Let Go, Let Gov" Review|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/09/26/south-park-let-go-let-gov-review|publisher=[[IGN]]|date=September 26, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Marcus Gilmer of ''[[The A.V. Club]]'' gave "Let Go, Let Gov" a C−, saying that "instead of reaching for some sort of sharp satire, there's a settling for an easy, cheap joke." He adds that the central story-line about the NSA "wanders a bit with stale riffs and a lackadaisical payoff".&lt;ref name=AVClub/&gt;

This is a list of '''important publications''' in [[medicine]], organized by field.

Some reasons why a particular publication might be regarded as important:
*'''Topic creator''' &amp;ndash; A publication that created a new topic
*'''Breakthrough''' &amp;ndash; A publication that changed scientific knowledge significantly
*'''Influence''' &amp;ndash; A publication which has significantly influenced the world or has had a massive impact on the teaching of medicine.&lt;!-- The text of this lead section was substituted into this page from [[Template:List of publications intro]]. --&gt;&lt;!--An entry in this list should include citations for statements about the importance of the publication. Otherwise it may be challenged and removed.--&gt;

The dialect of Yefren in the east differs somewhat from that of Nalut and Jadu in the west.&lt;ref&gt;Beguinot 1931:VIII&lt;/ref&gt; A number of Old Nafusi phrases appear in Ibadite manuscripts as early as the 12th century.&lt;ref&gt;Tadeusz Lewicki, "De quelques textes inédits en vieux berbère provenant d'une chronique ibāḍite anonyme" and André Basset, "Note additionnelle", ''Revue des études islamiques'' VIII, 1934, pp. 277, 298&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[Ethnologue]]'' entry includes nearby [[Zuara Berber]], [[Matmata Berber]] and [[Djerbi language|Djerbi]] under the rubric "Nafusi", which corresponds to neither local nor to academic usage of the term.

The dialect of Jadu is described in some detail in Beguinot (1931).&lt;ref&gt;Francesco Beguinot, ''Il berbero nefûsi di Fassâṭo: grammatica, testi raccolti dalla viva voce, vocabolarietti''.  Roma: Istituto per l'Oriente 1931&lt;/ref&gt; Motylinski (1898) describes the dialect of Jadu and Nalut as spoken by a student from Yefren.&lt;ref&gt;p. 1, A. de Calassanti-Motylinski, ''Le Djebel Nefousa: transcription, traduction française et notes, avec une étude grammaticale'', Paris: Ernest Leroux, 1898.&lt;/ref&gt;

Nafusi shares several innovations with the [[Zenati languages]], but unlike these other Berber varieties it maintains prefix vowels before open syllables. For example, ''ufəs'' "hand" &lt; *''afus'', rather than Zenati ''fus''. It appears especially closely related to [[Sokna language|Sokni]] and [[Siwi language|Siwi]] to its east.&lt;ref&gt;Maarten Kossmann, 1999, ''Essai sur la phonologie du proto-berbère'', Köln: Rüdiger Köppe, pp. 29-33&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 2015/2016 [[New Year's Eve]] celebrations, there were [[mass sexual assaults]], 24 [[rape]]s, and numerous [[theft]]s in [[Germany]], mainly in the [[Cologne]] city center.

Many of the incidents involved women being surrounded and assaulted by groups of men on the street.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rp-online.de/nrw/staedte/duesseldorf/blaulicht/duesseldorf-mehr-faelle-von-sexueller-belaestigung-41-anzeigen-aid-1.5677740 |title=Düsseldorf - Mehr Fälle von sexueller Belästigung: 41 Anzeigen |trans-title=Dusseldorf - More cases of sexual harassment: 41 reports |work=RP ONLINE |language=de |accessdate=16 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=BBCnewsreport/&gt; Cologne police chief Wolfgang Albers stated that the perpetrators in his city were reportedly men of "[[Arab people|Arab]] or [[North Africa]]n appearance" and said that Germany had never experienced such mass sexual assaults before.&lt;ref name=DW3&gt;{{cite news|title=String of New Year's Eve sexual assaults outrages Cologne|url=http://www.dw.com/en/string-of-new-years-eve-sexual-assaults-outrages-cologne/a-18958334|accessdate=24 January 2016|publisher=Deutsche Welle|date=4 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=BBCnewsreport/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-europe-migrants-germany-challenges-in-idUSKCN0V6173  |title=Cologne attacks show Germany unprepared for migration challenge |website=Reuters |date=28 January 2016 |accessdate=18 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/reports-of-new-years-eve-sexual-assaults-feed-into-german-debate-over-migrant-crisis-145200420 |title=Reports of New Year's Eve Sexual Assaults Feed Into German Debate Over Migrant Crisis |website=[[The Wall Street Journal]] |date=5 January 2016 |accessdate=18 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=LocalNotOrganized/&gt; The attacks sparked an international outcry, a debate about [[women's rights]] (especially in [[Islam]]ic culture), the sustainability of [[Asylum in Germany|Germany's asylum policy]], and [[violence]] and [[sexism]] against [[women]] by [[immigrant]]s from Arab countries and North Africa. Taking place during the [[European migrant crisis]] (see [[Timeline of the European migrant crisis|timeline]]), the attacks also led to a hardening of attitudes against immigration and attacks on immigrants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://yougov.co.uk/news/2016/01/12/germans-attitudes-immigration-harden-following-col/ |title=German attitudes to immigration harden following Cologne attacks |website=[[YouGov]] |date=12 January 2016 |accessdate=18 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Moulson|first1=Geir|title=Germany: Pakistanis, Syrian attacked in Cologne amid tension|url=https://apnews.com/f866ee3b338044c0a6cf0e7940dbdf0c/germany-pakistanis-syrian-attacked-cologne-amid-tension|accessdate=9 January 2018|agency=Associated Press|date=11 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was speculated that the assaults in Cologne were organized. Police said that some perpetrators used [[social media]] to meet for New Year's Eve celebrations,&lt;ref name=LocalNotOrganized&gt;{{cite web|title=Cologne attacks 'not organized': police chief|date=12 February 2016|work=The Local|url=http://www.thelocal.de/20160212/cologne-attacks-were-not-organized-police-chief}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ds3"/&gt;&lt;ref name="fc"/&gt;&lt;ref name=socialmedia&gt;{{cite web|title=Cologne mass sex attack 'was organised and plotted on social media' says police chief|date=12 February 2016|work=Daily Express|url=http://www.express.co.uk/news/world/643468/Cologne-mass-sex-attack-frenzy-New-Year-social-media}}&lt;/ref&gt; but [[Ralf Jäger]], Minister of the Interior of [[North Rhine-Westphalia]], said there was "so far no evidence that the perpetrators had arranged the assaults before New Year's Eve".&lt;ref name="ds3"/&gt; Jürgen Mathies, the new Cologne police chief, said many of the perpetrators were from countries where they might be familiar with "this behaviour, where women are hemmed in and then abused by a large number of men at once".&lt;ref name=LocalNotOrganized/&gt;&lt;ref name=socialmedia/&gt; According to both Jäger and Mathies, the suspects did not come from [[pickpocketing]] or [[organized crime]] gangs.&lt;ref name=LocalNotOrganized/&gt;&lt;ref name="ds3"/&gt;&lt;ref name=socialmedia/&gt;

The Cologne assaults were not reported by the national media for days, and ''[[The Local]]'' says many news outlets started reporting it only after a wave of anger on social media made covering the story unavoidable.&lt;ref name="thelocaldesilence"/&gt; This led to claims that the [[Lying press|media is forced into line and was attempting to cover up]] crimes by immigrants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cover-up claim over NYE mass sexual assaults|date=4 January 2016|work=[[The Local]]|url=https://www.thelocal.de/20160104/refugees-blamed-for-mass-sexual-assault-in-cologne}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although Cologne Mayor [[Henriette Reker]] condemned the assaults, she was strongly criticized for some of her comments and was accused of [[victim blaming|blaming the victims]]. Cologne's police chief, [[Wolfgang Albers (police president)|Wolfgang Albers]], was transferred to provisional retirement for his handling of the situation. The police response and delayed media reaction met strong criticism from German citizens, with some placing blame on the [[European migrant crisis]].&lt;ref name="BBCnewsreport"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-35231046|title=Germany Shocked by Cologne New Year Gang Assaults on Women|date=5 January 2016|work=[[BBC News]]|accessdate=7 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The governments of [[Slovakia]] and the [[Czech Republic]] called for an emergency EU meeting following the assaults and various other EU governments made statements concerning the attacks.

On 7 June, a [[Federal Criminal Police Office (Germany)|Federal Criminal Police Office]] report confirmed that most of the perpetrators were of North African origin and had arrived in Germany during the European migrant crisis. Investigative results about the perpetrators were congruent with witnesses' statements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rp-online.de/politik/deutschland/berlin/blog/silvester-nacht-von-koeln-taeter-kamen-mit-fluechtlingswelle-ins-land-aid-1.6034491|title=Silvester-Täter kamen mit Flüchtlingswelle ins Land|trans-title=Silvester - perpetrators came with wave of refugees into the country|work=Rheinische Post|date=9 June 2016|accessdate=23 June 2016|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt; Perpetrators benefited from weak criminal prosecution and low police presence. [[Group dynamics]] and personal frustration among the offenders also fuelled the crimes. The report also linked the assaults to the purported phenomenon of ''[[Mass sexual assault in Egypt|taharrush jamai]]'' (collective harassment)&lt;ref name="huff1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/alex-shams/sexism-isnt-an-arab-cultural-practice_b_9022056.html|title=Taharrush Gamea and sexism are not Arabic cultural practices|work=Huffington Post|accessdate=25 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; in some Arab countries.&lt;ref name="weltbka"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.welt.de/politik/deutschland/article156038699/Polizeiversagen-bestaerkte-die-Koelner-Sex-Taeter.html|title=Polizeiversagen bestärkte die Kölner Sex-Täter|trans-title=Police failure encouraged the Cologne sex offenders|work=Die Welt|date=7 June 2016|accessdate=23 June 2016|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the attacks, Germany updated its laws, making it easier to deport immigrants convicted of [[Sex and the law|sex crimes]] and broadening the definition of sexual assault to include any sexual act that a victim declines through verbal or physical cues. Previously German law required a victim to physically resist their attacker&lt;ref name=nomeansno&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-36726095|title=Germany rape law: 'No means No' law passed|date=7 July 2016|work=[[BBC News]]|accessdate=7 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; (see [[rape in Germany]]).

===Cologne===
[[File:Köln nach Silvestervorfällen 2015-16-4149.jpg|thumb|Cologne main square between the [[Köln Hauptbahnhof|central railway station]] and the city's [[Cologne Cathedral|cathedral]] was the main site of the robberies and assaults.]]
On New Year's Eve, December 2015, witnesses reported that [[firecracker]]s were thrown into a crowd from a group of people of around 500, which had doubled in size by later that night, at the square in front of [[Köln Hauptbahnhof|Cologne's Central Station]].&lt;ref name=local&gt;{{cite news|title=Cover-up claim over NYE mass sexual assaults|url=http://www.thelocal.de/20160104/refugees-blamed-for-mass-sexual-assault-in-cologne|accessdate=24 January 2016|publisher=The Local|date=4 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following this event, groups of men exploited the confusion to rob and [[Sexual assault|sexually assault]] people in the area and within the station.&lt;ref name="local"/&gt;&lt;ref name="dz"/&gt; According to witnesses, the attackers surrounded women in groups of 30–40.&lt;ref name="TheGuardJan6"/&gt;

According to the Cologne police report on 2 January, the suspects mostly used [[sexual assault]] (including [[groping]]) to distract victims while robbing them of mobile phones and wallets.

On 5 January, shortly after the assaults, Cologne mayor [[Henriette Reker]] said in a press conference that there was "no evidence that people who are residing in Cologne as refugees are amongst the perpetrators". Cologne's police president, [[Wolfgang Albers (police president)|Wolfgang Albers]], stated that "the police has no knowledge about the offenders".&lt;ref name="dz"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zeit.de/news/2016-01/05/kriminalitaet-polizei-hat-nach-uebergriffen-keine-erkenntnisse-ueber-taeter-05161803 |title=Polizei hat nach Übergriffen keine Erkenntnisse über Täter |trans-title=Police lack information about criminals after assaults |work=[[Die Zeit]]|accessdate=24 January 2016}}{{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; To some, including the German Minister of Justice [[Heiko Maas]], the assaults appeared to have been organized or coordinated, the perpetrators having arrived in large groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.faz.net/aktuell/politik/sexuelle-uebergriffe-in-koeln-das-ganze-scheint-abgesprochen-gewesen-zu-sein-13999522.html |title=Das Ganze scheint abgesprochen gewesen zu sein |trans-title=The whole thing seems to have been prearranged |work=[[Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung]]|accessdate=24 January 2016}}{{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Police later said that some perpetrators used [[social media]] to meet at the New Year's Eve celebrations,&lt;ref name=LocalNotOrganized/&gt;&lt;ref name="ds3"/&gt;&lt;ref name="fc"/&gt;&lt;ref name=socialmedia/&gt; but [[Ralf Jäger]], Minister of the Interior of [[North Rhine-Westphalia]], said there was "so far no evidence that the perpetrators had arranged the assaults before New Year's Eve".&lt;ref name="ds3"/&gt; According to Jäger in January and Jürgen Mathies, the new Cologne police chief in February, the suspects did not come from [[pickpocketing]] or [[organized crime]] gangs.&lt;ref name=LocalNotOrganized/&gt;&lt;ref name="ds3"/&gt;&lt;ref name=socialmedia/&gt;

On 7 January, several anonymous police officers from Cologne denied statements that the police did not know the nationality of the perpetrators; they told the press that "most of them" would have been freshly arrived asylum seekers. Contradicting statements from Cologne police leaders, these officers said that the identities of many people, including those who were arrested, had been thoroughly checked, so that police knew which groups of people were involved.&lt;ref name="welt"/&gt;

Around 70 people had been checked, and several brought to police stations or taken into custody. The majority of those in detention were [[Syrian people|Syrians]].&lt;ref name="welt"/&gt; The officers denied that the sexual harassment was only incidental, saying the truth was "exactly the opposite" and that most of the perpetrators sought primarily to commit sexual offenses, or in their words "sexual amusement".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.welt.de/politik/deutschland/article150733779/Vorrangig-ging-es-den-Taetern-um-Sexualstraftaten.html |title=Vorrangig ging es den Tätern um Sexualstraftaten |trans-title=The perpetrators primarily sought to commit sexual offenses |work=[[Die Welt]]|accessdate=24 January 2016}}{{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Arnold Plickert, North Rhine Westphalia's representative of German police union ''[[Gewerkschaft der Polizei]]'', confirmed that asylum seekers were "definitely" involved.&lt;ref name="welt"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.welt.de/politik/deutschland/article150735341/Die-meisten-waren-frisch-eingereiste-Asylbewerber.html|title=Die meisten waren frisch eingereiste Asylbewerber |trans-title=Most were recently-arrived asylum seekers |work=[[Die Welt]]|accessdate=24 January 2016}}{{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spiegel.de/panorama/justiz/koeln-nach-silvester-attacken-fluechtlinge-laut-polizeigewerkschaft-unter-verdacht-a-1071005.html |title=Übergriffe an Silvester: Auch Flüchtlinge unter Verdächtigen in Köln |trans-title=New Year's Eve Assaults: Refugees also under suspicion in Cologne |work=[[Der Spiegel]]|accessdate=24 January 2016}}{{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 8 January, the [[Federal Ministry of the Interior (Germany)|Federal Ministry of the Interior]] acknowledged that two-thirds of the suspects checked by the [[Federal Police (Germany)|Federal Police]]—who are responsible for the railways and railway stations in Germany—in Cologne were asylum seekers. The same report stated that 31 suspects were identified by name, including 18 asylum seekers. In total, the suspects were nine [[Algeria]]ns, eight [[Morocco|Moroccans]], four Syrians, five [[Iran]]ians, two [[Germany|Germans]], an [[Iraq]]i, a [[Serb]], and an [[United States|American]].&lt;ref name="welt.de"/&gt; Another report on the same day stated that stolen mobile phones were located by the police within or in the vicinity of refugees' residences.&lt;ref name="ds2"/&gt;

In Dortmund, at least two complaints of sexual assaults were made by 11 January, but the police stated that there are probably more victims.

In Cologne, police dispatched 143&amp;nbsp;local officers and 70&amp;nbsp;federal officers to restore order. However, due to the darkness and the number of people involved, police chief [[Wolfgang Albers (police president)|Wolfgang Albers]] conceded that their efforts were not effective.&lt;ref name=local/&gt; In March, media outlets reported that there were not 143, but only 80 police officers deployed at the central station, the others being in service elsewhere in downtown Cologne. Also, the number of policemen at the station was reduced later that night, as there were further police operations in the city. A police spokesman said that the corrected number had been transmitted to the Parliamentary Committee of the Interior on 11 January. However, he could not explain why it hadn't been published earlier.&lt;ref name="szg"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sueddeutsche.de/panorama/nach-den-uebergriffen-in-koeln-silvesternacht-in-koeln-offenbar-waren-viel-weniger-polizisten-im-einsatz-als-gedacht-1.2911408|title=Silvesternacht in Köln: Offenbar viel weniger Polizisten im Einsatz als gedacht|trans-title=Silvesternacht in Köln: Offenbar viel weniger Polizisten im Einsatz als gedacht|work=[[Süddeutsche Zeitung]]|language=German|accessdate=18 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cologne police came under criticism for their handling of the situation, as their initial press release described the New Year's Eve celebrations as "playful". Days later, the German [[Federal Criminal Police Office (Germany)|Federal Criminal Police Office]] said the incidents were, "A phenomenon known in some [[Arab World|Arab countries]] as ''taharrush jamai''" (translated as "group sexual harassment").&lt;ref name="welt3"/&gt;&lt;ref name="bbc11.01.2016"&gt;{{cite news|last=Staff|title=Cologne attackers were of migrant origin - minister|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-35280386|work=[[BBC News]]|publisher=[[BBC]]|date=11 January 2016|accessdate=24 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bbc15.02.2013"&gt;{{cite news|last=Maqbool|title=Why are sex attacks on the rise in Tahrir Square?|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-21441624|work=[[BBC News]]|publisher=[[BBC]]|date=15 February 2013|accessdate=25 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
However, this is not an accepted cultural practice in the Arab world&lt;ref name="huff1"/&gt;

One victim who was robbed and assaulted was told to report the incident elsewhere by the police.&lt;ref name=DW/&gt; Interior Minister [[Thomas de Maizière]] also criticized the [[North Rhine-Westphalia]] police for describing the celebrations as "peaceful".&lt;ref name=DW2/&gt; Police chief Wolfgang Albers later called the assaults "a completely new dimension of crime".&lt;ref name=BBC3/&gt;

Düsseldorf police told reporters they were investigating whether the attacks in Cologne were linked to a gang of roughly 2,000&amp;nbsp;North African men, a known criminal network in Düsseldorf.&lt;ref name="DPAJan6"&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Deutsche Presse-Agentur|date=6 January 2016|accessdate=7 January 2016|title=Police investigate organized crime ring's links to Cologne attacks|url=http://www.dpa-international.com/news/international/police-investigating-organized-crime-rings-links-to-cologne-attacks-a-47829553.html|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160110212623/http://www.dpa-international.com/news/international/police-investigating-organized-crime-rings-links-to-cologne-attacks-a-47829553.html|archivedate=10 January 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|agency=Associated Press|publisher=CBS News|date=6 January 2016|accessdate=24 January 2016|title=Germany sex assaults could be linked to criminal gang|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/germany-police-cologne-sexual-assaults-criminal-network-refugees-migrants|location=Cologne, Germany}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 7 January, the police acknowledged an information blackout until the interior committee of the parliament of North Rhine-Westphalia discussed the events on 11 January. That same day, a report by a leading police officer in Cologne on New Year's Eve was cited in several newspapers, including criticism that the number of police officers was too small to deal with the events.&lt;ref name="ds"/&gt; According to the report, the perpetrators acted "with a disrespect I didn't see in 29 years of service." Some shouted, "I am Syrian! You have to treat me friendly. Mrs [[Angela Merkel|Merkel]] has invited me!" Others tore their immigration papers while saying, "You can't do me anything. Tomorrow I will go and get new papers."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.welt.de/politik/deutschland/article150729450/Das-Protokoll-zur-Koelner-Chaos-Nacht-zum-Nachlesen.html|title=Das Protokoll zur Kölner Chaos-Nacht zum Nachlesen|trans-title=The Protocol Cologne Chaos Nights for future reference|work=[[Die Welt]]|accessdate=24 January 2016}}{{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of the allegations of misinformation and the "loss of public trust", Albers was transferred to provisional retirement for his handling of the situation on 8 January.&lt;ref name="IBTimes"&gt;{{cite news|title=Cologne sex attacks: Police chief Wolfgang Albers 'sacked' following heavy criticism|url=http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/cologne-sex-attacks-police-chief-wolfgang-albers-sacked-following-heavy-criticism-1536891|work=International Business Times|accessdate=12 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="spiegel.de"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spiegel.de/panorama/justiz/koeln-ralf-jaeger-versetzt-polizeipraesident-albers-in-ruhestand-a-1071134.html|title=Einsatz in der Silvesternacht: Kölns Polizeipräsident in einstweiligen Ruhestand versetzt|trans-title=Offset Cologne Police President in hiatus: use in the New Year's Eve|work=[[Der Spiegel]]|accessdate=24 January 2016}}{{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The German [[Federal Criminal Police Office (Germany)|Federal Criminal Police Office]] (Bundeskriminalamt, BKA) stated on 9 January that the incidents of collective sexual harassment were a phenomenon known in Arab countries as "''taharrush gamea''" ("communal sexual harassment"). The BKA announced their intention to investigate the facts about such incidents in all German federal states and learn how to combat them.&lt;ref name="welt3"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.welt.de/politik/deutschland/article150813517/Das-Phaenomen-taharrush-gamea-ist-in-Deutschland-angekommen.html|title=Sexuelle Belästigung: Das Phänomen "taharrush gamea" ist in Deutschland angekommen|trans-title=Sexual Harassment: The phenomenon "taharrush gameâ" has arrived in Germany|author=Martin Lutz|date=10 January 2016|work=Die Welt|accessdate=24 January 2016|language=de}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 15 January, the Cologne police offered a reward of 10,000 [[euro]] for relevant information leading to the identification of an offender. The posters were hung up near airports, railway stations, and refugees' residences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.focus.de/politik/videos/nach-silvesternacht-in-koeln-auf-deutsch-und-arabisch-polizei-sucht-mit-fahndungsplakat-nach-taetern_id_5215077.html|title=10.000 Euro Belohnung ausgesetzt: Polizei sucht mit Fahndungsplakat nach Tätern|trans-title=Exposed to 10,000 Euro reward: Police seek offenders with wanted posters|work=[[Focus (German magazine)|Focus]]|accessdate=26 January 2016}}{{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Hamburg, 2,000 euro were offered as a reward.&lt;ref name="HA5"/&gt;

In reaction to the events at Cologne, the North Rhine-Westfalia police conducted several raids in refugee accommodations all over its territory in the following days to increase pressure on criminal migrants. Among others, raids were conducted in [[Recklinghausen]], where the perpetrator of [[January 2016 Paris police station attack|a January 2016 attempted attack]] at a police station in [[Paris]] lived before committing that crime. Further raids were reported from [[Kalk, Cologne]]; and [[Ahlen]]. In Ahlen, only 144 of 230 registered persons were found during the raid; the others had fled. Around 50 percent of those present lived under false identities. The police opened 86 criminal proceedings for illegal residence, drug crimes, abuse of social benefits, and personal injury.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.welt.de/politik/deutschland/article151372514/Polizei-NRW-erhoeht-Druck-auf-kriminelle-Asylbewerber.html|title=Polizei NRW erhöht Druck auf kriminelle Asylbewerber|trans-title=NRW police increased pressure on criminal asylum seekers|work=[[Die Welt]]|accessdate=26 January 2016}}{{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cologne police stepped up police presence at [[Cologne Carnival]] in reaction to the incidents. More than 2,500 security forces were deployed, more than three times the amount of forces utilized in the previous year.&lt;ref name="kr"/&gt; Cologne police also kept sexual assault suspects out of the Carnival celebrations with entry bans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www1.wdr.de/themen/infokompakt/nachrichten/nrwkompakt/karneval-polizei-zutrittsverbote-koeln-100.html|title=Kölner Polizei schließt Tatverdächtige vom Karneval aus|trans-title=Cologne police exclude suspects from Carnival|work=[[Westdeutscher Rundfunk|WDR]]|accessdate=31 January 2016}}{{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; An all-girls high school in Cologne was closed at Carnival, while others addressed the incidents in class and informed their pupils about preventive measures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.welt.de/vermischtes/article151665766/Gymnasium-gibt-Schuelerinnen-Karneval-frei-zur-Sicherheit.html|title=Gymnasium gibt Schülerinnen Karneval frei – zur Sicherheit|trans-title=School gives students carnival dates - for safety|work=[[Die Welt]]|accessdate=31 January 2016}}{{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, on 5 February, [[New Year's Eve sexual assaults in Germany#Sexual offences at Carnival|three rapes]] were reported, at least two of them by migrants.&lt;ref name="fa"/&gt;

There were conflicting reports about the number of detainees. According to initial reports by the [[BBC]], eight suspects, all asylum seekers, were detained in Cologne, though no official statement on their involvement was made.&lt;ref name="BBC"/&gt; Further reports said that five men from the ages of 18 to 24 were arrested, although they were later found to have committed unrelated crimes.&lt;ref name="DPAJan6"/&gt; Reports made on 7 January suggested that police officials detained more people (namely asylum seekers) on New Year's Eve than they admitted publicly.&lt;ref name="welt"/&gt; According to a police report leaked to the media, there were 71 people controlled, of whom 11 were arrested, and four taken into custody.

On 8 January, Cologne Police announced the arrest of two suspects in connection with the attacks. They were identified&amp;mdash;in keeping with German privacy law&amp;mdash;as Issam D., a 16-year-old [[Morocco|Moroccan]]; and Mohamed T., a 23-year-old [[Tunisia]]n. Both were said to be asylum seekers. The police reported that they found video footage of assaults on New Year's Eve on their mobile phones. The suspects were also found in possession of a piece of paper with Arabic-German translations of derogatory sexual terms and phrases including "I want sex with you" and "I will kill you".&lt;ref name="Spiegel"&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Der Spiegel|date=8 January 2016|accessdate=8 January 2016|title=Übergriffe an Silvester: Kölner Polizei nimmt zwei Verdächtige fest|trans-title=Assaults on New Year's Eve: Cologne police arrest two suspects|url=http://www.spiegel.de/panorama/justiz/koelner-polizei-nimmt-nach-uebergriffen-zwei-verdaechtige-fest-a-1071100.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both of them were set free shortly after their arrest.&lt;ref name="WDR"&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Westdeutscher Rundfunk|date=10 January 2016|accessdate=10 January 2016|title=Festgenommene wieder auf freiem Fuß|trans-title=Arrested again on the loose|url=http://www1.wdr.de/themen/aktuell/festnahmen-koeln-102.html|language=de}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 8 January, federal police had identified 31 suspects, among whom were 18 identified asylum seekers. Of these, 17 were said by the Interior Ministry to be from [[Algeria]] or [[Morocco]].

On 19 January, it was reported that there was a first arrest because of allegations of sexual offences. The detainee was a 26-year old Algerian who was living in an refugee camp in [[Kerpen]]. He was arrested on the last weekend along with a fellow countryman who was accused of theft.&lt;ref name="welt7"/&gt; By 21 January, there were 30 suspects for the Cologne incidents, 25 of whom were of Moroccan or Algerian origin.

On 29 January, it was reported that a further suspect, a man from Algeria, was arrested due to property offence and resistance against enforcement officers. Criminal investigations in Cologne were conducted against 44 people, North Africans by majority, ten of whom were in investigative custody as of 29 January.&lt;ref name="waz"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.derwesten.de/region/staatsanwaltschaft-koeln-mehr-als-1000-anzeigen-id11507959.html |title=Staatsanwaltschaft Köln: Mehr als 1000 Anzeigen |trans-title=Cologne Prosecutor's Office: More than 1000 criminal complaints |work=[[Westdeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung]]|accessdate=31 January 2016}}{{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; The number of identified suspects in Cologne was 73 by 15 February, with 15 of them being in investigative custody.&lt;ref name="waz2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ds4"/&gt; A large majority of the suspects were from Algeria and Morocco. 30 Moroccans, 27 Algerians, and three Tunisians were among the suspects, along with a [[Libya]]n, an [[Iran]]ian, four [[Iraq]]is, a [[Montenegrins|Montenegrin]], three Syrians, and three Germans.&lt;ref name="waz2"/&gt; By 17 March, the number of suspects had again risen to 120, 14 of whom were in investigative custody.&lt;ref name="szg"/&gt; By 6 April, the number of suspects in Cologne was 153, 149 of whom were non-Germans; 103 of the 153 suspects were from [[Morocco]] or [[Algeria]]. Sixty-eight persons were asylum seekers; 18 were residing in Germany illegally, and the legal status of 47 persons was unclear. Four persons were underage, unaccompanied refugees.&lt;ref name="spi"/&gt;

On 24 February, a first suspect, a 23-year-old Moroccan was sentenced to a penalty of six months on probation for stealing a cellphone from a woman as she was taking a picture of the [[Cologne Cathedral]] on New Year's Eve and also for carrying a small amount of drugs. Criminal proceedings were also taking place against two other men from Tunisia and Algeria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.faz.net/aktuell/politik/urteil-bewaehrungsstrafe-fuer-ersten-angeklagten-der-koelner-silvesternacht-14087803.html|title=Bewährungsstrafe für ersten Angeklagten der Kölner Silvesternacht|trans-title=Probation for first accused of Cologne New Year's Eve attacks|work=[[Frankfurter Allgemeine]]|language=German|accessdate=24 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another suspect in Cologne, identified only as Mehdi E.-B., a 19-year-old asylum seeker from Morocco, was recognized by victims, including a female student, in a TV report of ''[[Spiegel TV]]''. Along with seven alleged accomplices, he was accused of sexual assaulting the victims out of a group. When the police attempted to detain the men, conducting raids in Cologne, [[Hamm]], [[Troisdorf]], and [[Bornheim (Rheinland)|Bornheim]] on 18 February, they had already fled. Mehdi E.-B. was reported to have lived under a false identity at first, according to witnesses. The janitor of the migrant's residence said he had "stolen like a raven". In one residence, 20 cellphones were found, one of which had been stolen on New Year's Eve. Mehdi E.-B. was already sentenced for stealing a cellphone together with a man identified only as Otman K. in January 2016. Otman K. was suspected of being a member of the same group of accused sexual assailants as Mehdi E.-B.&lt;ref name="ds5"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spiegel.de/politik/deutschland/silvester-in-koeln-mutmasslicher-taeter-taucht-unter-a-1078459.html|title=Mutmaßlicher Silvester-Täter: Auf und davon|trans-title=Alleged perpetrators Silvester: Hit|work=[[Der Spiegel]]|language=German|accessdate=24 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 8 March, for the first time, Cologne police published photos of wanted men who are suspected in the New Year's Eve assaults. The photos were partly taken from victims who managed to take pictures of their assailants. In total, the police evaluated 1,100 hours of video footage taken from CCTV cameras and witnesses. A police spokesman explained that the sophisticated work that it took to link the men in the footage to specific crimes was a reason behind the late publishing. The next day, two of the wanted men were put under investigative custody. A 26-year-old man was arrested in [[Kerpen]], while a 31-year-old man from Algeria turned himself in to the police in [[Hamm]]. On March 9, police released further photos, one showing a man firing a weapon into the air; officials clarified that no one was injured by the gunshot.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.faz.net/aktuell/politik/inland/silvesternacht-in-koeln-polizei-nimmt-verdaechtige-von-fahndungsfotos-fest-14114725.html|title=Polizei nimmt Verdächtige von Fahndungsfotos fest|trans-title=Police arrest suspect of mugshots|work=[[Frankfurter Allgemeine]]|language=German|accessdate=9 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 28 April, a 19-year-old Moroccan and a 24-year-old person were arrested in northern [[Switzerland]]. The Moroccan was one of the suspects in the Cologne assaults, and had applied for asylum in Switzerland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/sexual-assaults_cologne-attack-suspect-arrested-in-switzerland/42120916|title=Cologne attack suspect extradited from Switzerland|work=Swissinfo|date=29 April 2016|accessdate=29 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 25 November, it was reported that in 369 of the 509 crime cases, which were sexually motivated, no perpetrators could be identified. The prosecutor's office could initiate 58 criminal investigations against 83 persons. Only 6 were convicted so far. The highest sentence was 1 year and 9 month due to sexual assault and robbery. 52 of the accused men had to be acquitted due to lack of unanimous identification. The investigators failed to convict more of the perpetrators because the vicinity of the station was "dark and overcrowded" and the CCTV recordings were of "miserable" quality.&lt;ref name="weltnew"/&gt;

===Other cities===
In [[Düsseldorf]], initially nine persons were named as suspects, eight of whom are migrants.&lt;ref name="welt10"/&gt; According to a media report, an 18-year-old woman from [[Mönchengladbach]] recognized a perpetrator in a report of ''[[Spiegel TV]]'' and decided to make a complaint to the police afterwards.

In [[Stuttgart]], a 20-year-old asylum seeker from [[Iraq]] was detained for sexually assaulting two girls while acting out of a group.&lt;ref name="FAZ2"/&gt; In [[Frankfurt]], the police is investigating ten men in the ages of 15 to 27, all asylum seekers or refugees, who were temporarily arrested for pickpocketing on New Year's Eve near the bridge of [[Eiserner Steg]]. They are trying to determine if these men were involved in the sexual assaults. One of the suspects is in investigative custody.&lt;ref name="fr"/&gt;

[[Reinhard Merkel]], a law professor from Hamburg, said that convicting the suspects, especially for sexual offences, will be difficult because an unequivocal identification by the victims is needed, which is often not the case. Furthermore, policemen stated that the video footage of the cameras within and outside the Cologne main station is partly unusable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.faz.net/aktuell/politik/inland/ermittlungen-nach-koeln-ich-nehme-nicht-an-dass-die-taeter-verurteilt-werden-koennen-14020264.html|title=Ich nehme nicht an, dass die Täter verurteilt werden können|trans-title=I do not suppose that the offender can be sentenced|work=[[Frankfurter Allgemeine]]|accessdate=24 January 2016}}{{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Dispute over definition of 'refugee' ===
By mid-February 2016, 73 suspects of criminal offences during Cologne's New Year's Night 2015/2016 had been identified of whom 58 had been arrested.The 73 consisted of 30 Moroccans, 27 Algerians, 4 Iraqis, 3 Tunisians, 3 Syrians, 3 Germans, and one each from Libya, Iran and Montenegro. While certain news outlets and campaigners considered only the arrested suspects coming from Syria or Iraq as "[[refugees]]", they had concluded that only three of the 58 arrested suspects were "refugees".&lt;ref name="gutteridge"/&gt;&lt;ref name="prosecutor"/&gt;&lt;br&gt;In reaction, Cologne's chief prosecutor Bremer angrily retorted that "the overwhelming majority" of the 73 suspected men were either [[asylum seeker]], [[Asylum seeker|asylum applicant]], or [[Illegal immigration|illegal immigrant]], which ''he'' all considered to "fall into the general category of [[refugee]]s".&lt;ref name="gutteridge"&gt;{{cite news |author=Nick Gutteridge |date=19 February 2016 |title=Cologne rapists were refugees |url=http://www.express.co.uk/news/world/644379/Cologne-attacks-German-prosector-New-Years-Eve-rapists-migrants-refugees |newspaper=[[Daily Express]] |accessdate=24 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="prosecutor"&gt;{{dead link|date= July 2018}} {{cite web |date=15 February 2016 |title=Prosecutor: Most Cologne New Year's suspects are refugees |url=https://news.yahoo.com/cologne-prosecutor-majority-suspects-asylum-seekers-135156726.html |work=[[Associated Press]] |accessdate=17 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At [[Karneval der Kulturen]] (''Carnival of Cultures'') festival in [[Kreuzberg]], [[Berlin]], on [[Pentecost]] weekend, twelve similar crimes were reported, eight of which were sexual assaults. Seven men of Tunisian, Moroccan, Libyan, and Algerian origin were arrested on charges of theft. Four further men were arrested under allegations of sexual assault. The press reported the case of two teenage girls, ages 17 and 18, who were encircled and molested by a group of ten young men.

Some remarks given by Cologne Mayor [[Henriette Reker]] during a press conference were interpreted as a call for women to follow a "code of conduct", including staying at "arm's length" from strangers.&lt;ref name=Independent&gt;{{cite news|title=Mayor of Cologne says women should have code of conduct to prevent future assault|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/mayor-of-cologne-says-women-should-have-code-of-conduct-to-prevent-future-assault-a6798186.html|accessdate=5 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|id=KRzfSx-I-3o|title=Übergriffe in Köln: Henriette Reker gibt Pressekonferenz am 05.01.2016 [Assaults in Cologne : Henriette Reker 's press conference on 01.05.2016]}}&lt;/ref&gt; She later came under criticism for her comments. By the evening of 5 January, ''#einearmlänge'' (''an arm's length'') became one of Germany's top-trending hashtags on [[Twitter]].&lt;ref name=DW2/&gt; However, her remarks were taken out of context and were an answer by Reker to a specific question from a journalist asking for concrete examples from an existing guideline of the city of Cologne for women on how to prevent assaults from strangers.&lt;ref name=sz_armlaenge&gt;{{cite news|title=Eine Armlänge Empörung|url=http://www.sueddeutsche.de/panorama/koeln-eine-armlaenge-empoerung-1.2806458|accessdate=27 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reker called for a crisis meeting with the police in response to the incidents.&lt;ref name=DW/&gt;&lt;ref name=BBC/&gt; She called it "completely improper" to link the apparently mostly North African perpetrators to refugees.&lt;ref name=BBC3/&gt;

The Interior Minister of the state of [[North Rhine-Westphalia]], Ralf Jäger, said, "We will not accept that groups of North African men gather expressly for the purpose of debasing women by sexually assaulting them."&lt;ref name=DW3/&gt; He added that police had to adjust to the fact that groups of men had attacked women. He also spoke against anti-immigrant groups, saying, "What happens on the right-wing platforms and in chat rooms is at least as awful as the acts of those assaulting the women ... This is poisoning the climate of our society."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-35248601|title=Cologne sex attacks 'require police rethink'|publisher=BBC News|date=7 January 2016|accessdate=24 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

North Rhine-Westphalia's Head of State, [[Hannelore Kraft]], stated that police and courts should and will act consequently against this new dimension of violence and sexual assaults by men. She expressed her hope that as many offenders as possible are identified and punished, which had to happen regardless of background. If the requirements were met, according to her, perpetrators should also be deported.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sueddeutsche.de/panorama/uebergriffe-an-silvester-de-maizire-uebt-massive-kritik-an-koelner-polizei-1.2806333|title=De Maizière übt massive Kritik an Kölner Sicherheitskonzept|trans-title=De Maizière exerts massive criticism of Cologne safety concept|publisher=Süddeutsche Zeitung|date=5 January 2016|accessdate=24 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; A week later, she was skeptical about any possible deportations. Even if the requirements were met, the identified perpetrators who hailed from [[Algeria]] and [[Morocco]] could not be deported as those countries would likely simply refuse to accept them back.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zeit.de/politik/2016-01/nordrhein-westfalen-hannelore-kraft-koeln-ralf-jaeger|title=Hannelore Kraft verteidigt Innenminister Jäger|trans-title=Hannelore Kraft defended Interior Minister Jäger|publisher=Die Zeit|date=12 January 2016|accessdate=24 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kraft and Jäger criticised Cologne's police leaders for not requesting police reinforcements, which were said to have been on standby on New Year's Eve.&lt;ref name="faz2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.faz.net/aktuell/politik/koelner-silvester-nacht-wieder-hundert-neue-anzeigen-14010655.html |title=Wieder hundert neue Anzeigen |trans-title=Once again, hundreds of new complaints |work=[[Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung]]|accessdate=24 January 2016}}{{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Christian Democratic Union of Germany|CDU]]'s Secretary General [[Peter Tauber]], whose party is in opposition in North Rhine-Westphalia, urged Jäger to step down because of the events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sueddeutsche.de/news/panorama/kriminalitaet-cdu-generalsekretaer-tauber-legt-jaeger-ruecktritt-nahe-dpa.urn-newsml-dpa-com-20090101-160112-99-864751|title=CDU-Generalsekretär Tauber legt Jäger Rücktritt nahe|trans-title=CDU general secretary Tauber urges Jäger to resign|work=[[Süddeutsche Zeitung]]|accessdate=24 January 2016}}{{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the following days, Reker faced allegations that she had been well-informed by the Cologne police earlier on New Year's Eve than she previously claimed, which contradicted her own statements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.welt.de/regionales/nrw/article151134378/Polizei-hat-Reker-nicht-mangelhaft-informiert.html|title=Polizei hat Reker nicht mangelhaft informiert|trans-title=Police have kept Reker informed|work=[[Die Welt]]|accessdate=24 January 2016}}{{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jäger was attacked by the opposition parties in North Rhine-Westphalias parliament, CDU, and [[Free Democratic Party (Germany)|FDP]], which applied for an parliamentary inquiry committee for the Cologne events. In reaction, the state government published a timeline of its communication with the police authorities. This timeline shows that some information was transmitted to the state government late by Jäger, e.g. with a delay of three days after New Year's Day. The state government defended itself, including Jäger, by stating that the true extent of the assaults was "not foreseeable" at this time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.welt.de/regionales/nrw/article151134378/Polizei-hat-Reker-nicht-mangelhaft-informiert.html|title=Jäger informierte Kraft erst Tage nach Köln-Exzess|trans-title=Jäger informed Kraft only days after Cologne assaults|work=[[Die Welt]]|accessdate=24 January 2016}}{{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Cologne's Express newspaper, a police memo was leaked. Opposition politicians have said that Jäger should resign his position over what the leaked memo said.&lt;ref name=TDTJH070416 /&gt;

From March to November the parliamentary inquiry committee held 53 sessions in the [[Landtag of North Rhine-Westphalia]] and heard more than 150 witnesses. A reported is to be filed until the end of 2016. As a result, it was stated by the SPD representative in the committee that it was confirmed by the evidence that "the deployment of the security forces went wrong with graving consequences for the women affected". CDU ad FDP opposition parties accused the state government of "cover-up". Minister Jäger and his leading staff couldn't resolve the contradiction that they didn't act for days as they received exceptional warning messages on their smartphones on New Year's Day.&lt;ref name="weltnew"/&gt;

[[File:Flashmob gegen Männergewalt, Köln 2016 -4384.jpg|thumb|Protesters gather outside Cologne Cathedral with a sign reading "No to violence against women"]]

On 5 January, between 200 and 300 women protested outside the [[Cologne Cathedral]], demanding respect for women and action from Chancellor [[Angela Merkel]].&lt;ref name=DW2&gt;{{cite news|title=Twitter storm as Cologne mayor suggests women stay at 'arm's length' from strangers|url=http://www.dw.com/en/twitter-storm-as-cologne-mayor-suggests-women-stay-at-arms-length-from-strangers/a-18962430|work=DW|accessdate=24 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=BBC2&gt;{{cite news|title=Cologne sex attacks: Women protest against assaults by gangs|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-35239503|work=BBC News|accessdate=24 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another protest was held in Cologne on 12 March against misogyny and racism that was demonstrated during the assaults.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dw.com/en/thousands-protest-in-cologne-to-reclaim-feminism/a-19113359|title=Thousands protest in Cologne to 'reclaim feminism'|work=Deutsche Welle|date=12 March 2016|accessdate=14 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many Germans reacted with concern and anger. In neighbouring [[Düsseldorf]], where 113 complaints to the police in connection with sexual assaults and theft were made, a vigilante group was founded as a reaction to the events. The related [[Facebook]] page of the "Düsseldorf passt auf" ("Düsseldorf Watches Out") group garnered more than 3,300 members within two days. The Düsseldorf police denounced their activities and referred to the monopoly on legitimate use of force of the German state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.faz.net/aktuell/politik/bildung-einer-buergerwehr-die-selbsternannten-aufpasser-von-duesseldorf-14002759.html|title=Die selbsternannten Aufpasser von Düsseldorf|trans-title=The self-appointed watchdogs of Dusseldorf|work=[[Frankfurter Allgemeine]]|accessdate=24 January 2016}}{{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sales of legally available pepper and tear gas sprayers increased significantly. Gun manufacturers and dealers (Verband Deutscher Büchsenmacher und Waffenfachhändler VDB) also claimed increased sales due to the events.&lt;ref name=pep&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.welt.de/wirtschaft/article150758016/Deutsche-decken-sich-massenhaft-mit-Pfefferspray-ein.html|title=Deutsche decken sich massenhaft mit Pfefferspray ein|trans-title=Germans stock up pepper spray en masse|work=[[Die Welt]]|accessdate=24 January 2016}}{{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the Rhineland, requests for ''small weapons licences'' (''Kleiner Waffenschein'') increased as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rp-online.de/nrw/staedte/leverkusen/zahl-der-waffenschein-antraege-explodiert-aid-1.5709584|title=Leverkusen/Köln:Zahl der Waffenschein-Anträge explodiert|trans-title=Leverkusen/Cologne: number of firearms license requests explodes|work=rp-online.de|accessdate=24 January 2016}}{{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The phrase "Rapefugees not welcome" was coined by right wing demonstrators as a slogan following the events in Cologne.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=German protesters: 'Rapefugees not welcome'|url=http://www.ksat.com/news/national/german-protesters-rapefugees-not-welcome|publisher=[[KSAT-TV]]|agency=CNN|author=Holly Yan|accessdate=17 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lutz Bachmann]], founder of the organization ''Patriotic Europeans Against the [[Islamisation]] of the West'' ([[Pegida]]), which sold merchandise featuring the slogan, was accused of [[sedition]]{{by whom|date=July 2016}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title="Rapefugees not welcome": Pegida-Chef wegen Volksverhetzung angezeigt|trans-title="Rapefugees not welcome": Pegida boss appears for sedition|url=http://www.n-tv.de/politik/Pegida-Chef-wegen-Volksverhetzung-angezeigt-article16734751.html|work=n-tv.de|accessdate=24 January 2016|language=de}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Attacks against immigrants===
On 10 January, eleven people were beaten in Cologne, specifically in an area located close to where the sexual assaults occurred. The victims included six Pakistanis, three Guineans, and two Syrians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.nationalpost.com/news/angela-merkel-says-germany-has-lost-control-of-the-refugee-crisis-amid-public-anger-over-cologne-sex-attacks|title=Angela Merkel says Germany has lost control of the refugee crisis amid public anger over Cologne sex attacks|work=National Post|author=Justin Huggler|accessdate=24 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; All of the victims were injured and hospitalized.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/germany/12092354/Cologne-sex-attacks-New-Years-Eve-cases-rise-to-more-than-500.html|title=Cologne sex attacks: Mob attacks group of migrants in 'manhunt' for suspects|work=The Daily Telegraph|author=James Rothwell|accessdate=24 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The attacks were quickly reported by the media and condemned by Justice Minister [[Heiko Maas]].

===Federal politics===
Merkel and Justice Minister [[Heiko Maas]] condemned the assaults. Maas described the assaults as a "completely new dimension of organized criminality."&lt;ref name=DW/&gt; Merkel contacted Reker, calling for a tough response.&lt;ref name=Reuters&gt;{{cite news|title=Germans shaken by New Year attacks on women in Cologne|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-germany-assaults-idUKKBN0UJ1IL20160105|work=Reuters|author=Madeline Chambers|accessdate=5 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; She said that everything must be done "to find the perpetrators as quickly and comprehensively as possible and punish them, regardless of their origin or background", and promised preventive measures for the Carnival in February.&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt;&lt;ref name=BBC3/&gt;&lt;ref name=BBC2/&gt; [[Sigmar Gabriel]] ([[Social Democratic Party of Germany|SPD]]), vice chancellor and Minister for Economics, demanded quicker deportations of sentenced criminal migrants and explained that there should be "zero tolerance for criminality and sexual assaults".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spiegel.de/politik/deutschland/koeln-uebergriffe-an-silvester-vizekanzler-gabriel-fordert-hartes-vorgehen-gegen-taeter-a-1071009.html|title=Köln: Sigmar Gabriel fordert schnellere Abschiebungen|trans-title=Cologne: Sigmar Gabriel calls faster deportations|date=8 January 2016|work=SPIEGEL ONLINE|language=de}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Claudia Roth]] ([[Alliance '90/The Greens|Green Party]]) stated that while the attacks could not be excused, they were "not the first eruptions of sexual violence in our society". She also accused an Internet-"organised mob" of "calling for a hunt on non-white people and taking revenge".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.welt.de/politik/deutschland/article150753781/Mob-ruft-zur-Jagd-auf-nicht-weisse-Menschen-auf.html|title=Mob ruft zur Jagd auf nicht weiße Menschen auf|trans-title=Mob calls to hunt non-white people|work=[[Die Welt]]|accessdate=24 January 2016}}{{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Volker Bouffier]], vice-president of Chancellor Angela Merkel's [[Christian Democratic Union of Germany|CDU]] party, the attacks have weakened the consensus in favour of Germany's [[European migrant crisis|accepting large numbers]] of [[Refugees of the Syrian Civil War|refugees from Syria]] and the Middle East. He said, "Cologne has changed everything. People are now doubting."&lt;ref name=BBC-11-1-16&gt;{{cite news|author=Gavin Hewitt|title=Cologne attacks' profound impact on Europe|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-35261988|accessdate=11 January 2016|publisher=BBC News|date=11 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 9 January, the CDU adopted the "Mainz declaration" ("Mainzer Erklärung"), in which the party toughens its acting against criminality by migrants. Random police checks were also included, as well as quicker deportations of criminal migrants even if they were only sentenced to imprisonment on probation. To date, acceptance for asylum seekers can only be denied if they were sentenced to a three-year imprisonment at least, with a deportation below this degree of penalty possible but not mandatory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.tagesschau.de/inland/cdu-klausurtagung-101.html|title=CDU pocht auf schärfere Gesetze|trans-title=CDU insists on stricter laws|work=[[Tagesschau (Germany)|Tagesschau]]|accessdate=24 January 2016}}{{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 12 January, [[Hans-Jürgen Papier]], former head of the German [[Federal Constitutional Court of Germany|Federal Constitutional Court]], criticised Merkel's refugee policies. According to his statement, the public mood has shifted after the events of Cologne, which "manifested a partial failure of the state as a guarantor of freedom and safety of its citizens." He demanded an "altering of the course" by the government and added, "We have a legal vacuum regarding the protection of external [German] borders, which must not be."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.welt.de/politik/deutschland/article150894661/Papier-rechnet-mit-deutscher-Fluechtlingspolitik-ab.html|title=Papier rechnet mit deutscher Flüchtlingspolitik ab|trans-title=Papier settles up with German refugee policy|work=[[Die Welt]]|accessdate=24 January 2016}}{{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 14 January, criticism of Merkel grew as former chancellor [[Gerhard Schröder]] and [[Prime Minister of Lower Saxony|Lower Saxony Prime Minister]] [[Stephan Weil]] (both SPD) questioned her policies. Weil stated that the events of Cologne were "a low blow in every sense", and that Merkel's decision to open the borders "fatally permanently led to a special role of Germany in Europe". After the events, Schröder called for a crackdown of the state and a consistent deportation of offenders, saying, "Such people, no matter of which cultural background, have no place in Germany." He also accused Merkel of not having a plan against such events in the refugee crisis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.welt.de/politik/deutschland/article151034627/Die-Kanzlerin-wird-sich-korrigieren-muessen.html|title=Die Kanzlerin wird sich korrigieren müssen|trans-title=The Chancellor will have to correct herself|work=[[Die Welt]]|accessdate=24 January 2016}}{{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.focus.de/politik/deutschland/altkanzler-zur-fluechtlingskrise-da-wurde-schlicht-die-realitaet-ignoriert-schroeder-kritisiert-merkel_id_5212643.html|title="Realität ignoriert, keinen Plan": Kritik an Merkels Flüchtlingspolitik|trans-title="Ignores reality, no plan": criticism of Merkel's refugee policy|work=[[Die Welt]]|accessdate=24 January 2016}}{{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Former foreign minister [[Joschka Fischer]] (Green Party) defended the chancellor and demanded restraint of the Constitutional Court judges Papier and [[Udo Di Fabio]], who accused Merkel of breaking the law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.welt.de/politik/deutschland/article151034968/Ex-Kanzler-Schroeder-wirft-Merkel-Planlosigkeit-vor.html|title=Ex-Kanzler Schröder wirft Merkel Planlosigkeit vor|trans-title=Ex-Chancellor Schröder throws Merkel Planlosigkeit ago|work=[[Die Welt]]|accessdate=24 January 2016}}{{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 15 January, German Minister of Finance, [[Wolfgang Schäuble]] (CDU), suggested to establish the possibility of a national deployment of the [[Bundeswehr|German Federal Armed Forces]] as "nearly all other countries" did. He insisted that only securing the EU external borders was the solution to the migrant crisis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.welt.de/politik/deutschland/article151081094/Schaeuble-will-Autofahrer-in-Asylkrise-zur-Kasse-bitten.html|title=Schäuble will Autofahrer in Asylkrise zur Kasse bitten|trans-title=Schäuble will ask motorists in asylum crisis to checkout|work=[[Die Welt]]|accessdate=24 January 2016}}{{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the same day, opinion polls like ''[[Politbarometer]]'' showed declining approval for Merkel's migration policy and a significant rise of approval for the right-wing [[Alternative für Deutschland|AfD]] party, which would be the third political force with 10 to 11 percent of votes, but up to 15 percent in some federal states.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.welt.de/politik/deutschland/article151077789/AfD-laut-neuer-Umfrage-drittstaerkste-Kraft-im-Bund.html|title=Alternative für Deutschland laut Umfrage drittstärkste Kraft im Bund|trans-title=Alternative for Germany, according to a survey the third strongest party in the federal elections|date=15 January 2016|accessdate=24 January 2016|work=DIE WELT|language=de}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.heute.de/fluechtlingskrise-merkel-stuerzt-ab-mehrheit-haelt-obergrenze-von-200.000-nicht-fuer-machbar-41820126.html|title=Flüchtlingskrise: Merkel stürzt ab|trans-title=Refugee crisis: Merkel crashes|work=heute.de|accessdate=24 January 2016}}{{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An opinion poll conducted by [[INSA (Germany)|INSA]]/[[YouGov]] and published on 18 January predicted a 12.5 percent approval for the AfD for the federal elections while CDU figures fell to 32.5 percent, an all-time low for this poll.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.welt.de/politik/deutschland/article151170018/Union-sackt-auf-Allzeittief-AfD-mit-neuem-Rekord.html|title=Union sackt auf Allzeittief – AfD mit neuem Rekord|trans-title=Union sags on all-time low - AfD with new record|work=[[Die Welt]]|accessdate=24 January 2016}}{{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 16–19 January 2016, several politicians demanded alterations to Merkel's migration policies in reaction to the events, including [[Horst Seehofer]], [[Prime Minister of Bavaria]], his predecessor [[Edmund Stoiber]], and German Minister of Transportation [[Alexander Dobrindt]]. All of them are members of the Bavarian [[Christian Social Union in Bavaria|CSU]] party, which is in the federal government but opposes Merkel's actions during the migration crisis.&lt;ref name="welt8"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.welt.de/politik/deutschland/article151167985/Dobrindt-spricht-von-einem-Pakt-gegen-Deutschland.html|title=Dobrindt spricht von einem Pakt gegen Deutschland|trans-title=Dobrindt speaks of a pact against Germany|work=[[Die Welt]]|accessdate=24 January 2016}}{{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Around 50 CDU [[Bundestag]] MPs wrote a letter to Merkel demanding the closure of the German borders. However, other CDU MPs showed their support for Merkel.&lt;ref name="welt8"/&gt; SPD chief [[Sigmar Gabriel]] urged Merkel to act, and demanded that Morocco and Algeria take back the migrants to be deported by Germany.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spiegel.de/politik/ausland/fluechtlinge-sigmar-gabriel-droht-marokko-und-algerien-a-1072506.html|title=Abgelehnte Asylbewerber: Gabriel droht Marokko und Algerien mit Kürzung der Gelder|trans-title=Rejected asylum-seekers: Gabriel threatens Morocco and Algeria with reduction of finance|work=[[Der Spiegel]]|accessdate=24 January 2016}}{{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others such as SPD vice chairwoman [[Aydan Özoğuz]] warned of closing the borders.&lt;ref name="welt8"/&gt;

On 14 March, a joint press conference was held with the minister president of [[Saxony-Anhalt]], [[Reiner Haseloff]], after the three state elections in [[Saxony-Anhalt state election, 2016|Saxony-Anhalt]], [[Baden-Württemberg state election, 2016|Baden-Württemberg]], and [[Rhineland-Palatinate state election, 2016|Rhineland-Palatinate]], which saw a significant loss of votes for the CDU party and a rise of votes for the AfD party. During the press conference, Merkel tied the electoral success of the AfD among others to the Cologne sexual assaults. At the same time, she contradicted CSU chief [[Horst Seehofer]], who said that the AfD party's success would be an existential problem for the [[CDU/CSU]]. "I do not see it as an existential problem of the CDU, but I see it as a problem," Merkel told the press.&lt;ref name="frs"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fr-online.de/politik/landtagswahlen-petry-will-nicht-rechtspopulistisch-sein,1472596,33948666.html|title=Gabriel: Seehofer hat AfD stark gemacht|trans-title=Gabriel: Seehofer AfD made strong|work=[[Frankfurter Rundschau]]|language=German|accessdate=14 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Haseloff agreed with Merkel, saying, "The actual rise, which came for the AfD in the polls has a city name: It's Cologne."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://presse.phoenix.de/news/pressemitteilungen/2016/03/20160313_Haseloff/20160313_Haselhoff.phtml|title=Haseloff (CDU): "als christlich-demokratische Union hier in Sachsen-Anhalt nichts falsch gemacht"|trans-title=Haseloff (CDU): "As a Christian Democratic Union here in Saxony-Anhalt done nothing wrong"|work=[[Phoenix (German TV station)|Phoenix]]|language=German|accessdate=14 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; SPD chief [[Sigmar Gabriel]] accused Seehofer of strengthening the AfD by using "the same sayings".&lt;ref name="frs"/&gt;

BBC correspondent Gavin Hewitt describes the attacks as having "a profound impact on the rest of Europe. Certainly the boldness of the assaults and the sense of a powerless state will haunt the victims, but what has also been lost is trust – the essential glue in any society."&lt;ref name=BBC-11-1-16/&gt;

A Cologne-based [[imam]], Sami Abu-Yusuf, controversially said in an interview with the [[Russia]]n television channel [[REN TV]] that the women in Cologne were responsible for the incidents, because they were "running around half naked ... It's not surprising that the men attacked them. Dressing up like that is like pouring oil into the fire." [[Volker Beck (politician)|Volker Beck]] (Green Party) reported Abu-Yusuf to the police for "inciting criminal offences". The Ministry of the Interior of North Rhine-Westphalia acknowledged that Abu-Yusuf was under surveillance by the [[Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution]].&lt;ref name="lvz"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lvz.de/Nachrichten/Politik/Nach-umstrittendem-Kommentar-Beck-stellt-Strafanzeige-gegen-Koelner-Imam|title=Nach umstrittendem Kommentar: Beck stellt Strafanzeige gegen Kölner Imam|trans-title=

===Criticism of late media reporting===
Several media outlets at first did not cover the story and, according to Jörg Luyken, only started reporting on the incidents on 5 January, after a wave of anger on [[social media]] made covering them unavoidable.&lt;ref name="thelocaldesilence"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thelocal.de/20160105/brushing-sexual-assault-under-the-carpet-is-foolish|title=Silence on sex crimes will make racism worse|work=The Local|date=5 January 2016|accessdate=24 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; This delay was criticised by several politicians, including [[Hans-Peter Friedrich]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=In den Sozialen Netzwerken sind die ... - Hans-Peter Friedrich|trans-title=In the social networks are the ... - Hans-Peter Friedrich|url=https://www.facebook.com/hanspeter.friedrich/posts/1243584958990041?pnref=story|work=Facebook|accessdate=24 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The public television channel [[ZDF]] later acknowledged that they had failed to report on the incidents despite having sufficient knowledge to do so.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Übergriffe in Köln Eine Männergruppe und ihr Hintergrund|trans-title=Assaults in Cologne: A group of men and their background|url=http://www.faz.net/aktuell/feuilleton/debatten/nach-silvester-in-koeln-muss-es-um-die-taeter-gehen-13999062.html|newspaper=Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung|date=5 January 2016|accessdate=24 January 2016|issn=0174-4909|language=de|author=Ursula Scheer}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/germany/12085182/Cover-up-over-Cologne-sex-assaults-blamed-on-migration-sensitivities.html|title='Cover-up' over Cologne sex assaults blamed on migration sensitivities|date=6 January 2016|work=The Daily Telegraph|accessdate=24 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

ZDF later called the delay in reporting a "clear misjudgment", and said since then, it has been "over-whelmed with hate and anger".&lt;ref name=BBC-11-1-16 /&gt; This has reinforced discontent previously held by parts of the German public with news coverage relating to the [[European migrant crisis]], as well as a readiness to support the idea of the "Lügenpresse" (literally ''[[lying press]]'').&lt;ref name=BBC-11-1-16 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Allensbach-Studie Mehrheit fühlt sich über Flüchtlinge einseitig informiert|trans-title=Allensbach survey: Majority feels unilaterally informed about refugees|url=http://www.faz.net/aktuell/politik/fluechtlingskrise/allensbach-umfrage-zu-medienberichterstattung-in-fluechtlingskrise-13967959.html?printPagedArticle=true#pageIndex_2|newspaper=Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung|date=16 December 2015|accessdate=24 January 2016|issn=0174-4909|language=de|first=Renate|last=Köcher}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The delay in reporting on the assaults in the media lead to accusations that the authorities and the media attempted to ignore or cover up the attacks to avoid criticism against the current asylum and migration policy of the government.&lt;ref name=NYT /&gt;&lt;ref name=CNN&gt;{{cite news|title=Reports of New Year's Eve sex assaults in Cologne fuel German migrant debate |url=http://www.cnn.com/2016/01/05/europe/germany-cologne-new-year-assaults|publisher=CNN|date=5 January 2016|accessdate=24 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Local&gt;{{cite news |title=Cover-up claim over NYE mass sexual assaults|url=http://www.thelocal.de/20160104/refugees-blamed-for-mass-sexual-assault-in-cologne|work=The Local|accessdate=5 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[BBC]]'s [[Gavin Hewitt]] wrote, "What has fuelled the sense of crisis is the suspicion—now widely held—that the German establishment is not telling the truth."&lt;ref name=BBC-11-1-16 /&gt;

===Media reactions===
[[Al Jazeera]] published articles on 9 January claiming that the response of German society thus far had "little to do with protecting women and more to do with scapegoating the Middle Eastern or North African '[[Other (philosophy)|other]]' entering Germany."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Natasha Lennard|author2=Lukas Hermsmeier|url=http://america.aljazeera.com/opinions/2016/1/how-europe-should-respond-to-the-sexual-assaults-in-cologne.html|title=Germany's bad answer to the Cologne attacks|work=Al Jazeera|accessdate=24 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ross Douthat]], a conservative columnist for ''[[The New York Times]]'', warned of the transformative consequences of rapid, unchecked mass immigration, especially of young men. In his opinion, not only Germany has to close the borders and expel refugees who are in good health, but Merkel also has to step down, "so that her country, and the continent it bestrides, can avoid paying too high a price for her high-minded folly."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/10/opinion/sunday/germany-on-the-brink.html|title=Germany on the Brink|date=10 January 2016|work=The New York Times|accessdate=31 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Russia]], the state-run ''[[Rossiyskaya Gazeta]]'' stated that after the "Night of the Long Fingers" (a play on words that compares the event to the [[Nazis]]' ''[[Night of the Long Knives]]''), German media refused "to illuminate the extent of raids, plundering and rapes committed by refugees".&lt;ref name="welt5"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.welt.de/vermischtes/article151047253/Was-Europa-von-der-deutschen-Willkommenskultur-haelt.html|title=Was Europa von der deutschen Willkommenskultur hält|trans-title=What Europe thinks of the German culture of welcome|work=[[Die Welt]]|accessdate=24 January 2016}}{{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The economic professor [[Hans-Werner Sinn]] stated on 1 February, "The events of the New Year's night in Cologne are harbingers of massive social conflicts in the coming years and decades. With the chaotic, uncontrolled immigration from backward countries, the Federal Republic of Germany faces a heap of trouble." He also suggested a closure of the borders to secure freedom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.welt.de/wirtschaft/article151713703/Warum-geschlossene-Grenzen-auch-Freiheit-bedeuten.html|title=Warum geschlossene Grenzen auch Freiheit bedeuten|trans-title=Why closed borders mean freedom|work=[[Die Welt]]|accessdate=1 February 2016}}{{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the assailants were described by police and victims as young foreign men who spoke neither German nor English, a debate ensued as to how to deal with a large influx of young, mostly Muslim men from cultures where women lack the freedoms and protections they enjoy in the West. Far-right and anti-immigrant groups cited the attacks as evidence of dangers related to accepting huge numbers of migrants, but similar concerns were also expressed by mainstream elements within German society.&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt;

German [[feminist]]s signed a petition opposing sexualised violence and racism, stating that it "is wrong to highlight sexualised violence only when the perpetrators are allegedly" perceived as "others" and ignore all other sexual violence, pointing to German [[Federal Police (Germany)|Federal Police]] statistics that show there are more than 7,300 reported rapes and sexual assaults in Germany every year and "the many more that are never reported."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2016/01/13/german-feminists-write-open-letter-to-cologne-attackers_n_8968432.html|title=Cologne Attacks: Our Response Must Be Against Sexual Violence, Not Race, Say Feminists|work=[[Huffington Post]]|date=13 January 2016|accessdate=5 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

German feminist [[Alice Schwarzer]] wrote a book about the Cologne incidents, ''Der Schock - die Silvesternacht von Köln'' (''The shock - New Year's Eve of Cologne''). In it, she characterized the perpetrators as "not any Muslims. The Muslim next door does not automatically grope women. It was the kind of men, for whom the [[Sharia]] is above the law and the woman below the man." In addition, she stated, "That evening they used a for them very simple weapon: sexual violence." Schwarzer faced criticism by other feminists and Islamic associations in Germany.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.n-tv.de/panorama/Alice-Schwarzer-warnt-vor-Scharia-Islam-article17745356.html|title=Alice Schwarzer warnt vor 'Scharia-Islam'|trans-title=Alice Schwarzer warns of 'Sharia Islam'|work=n-tv.de|accessdate=6 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jakob Augstein]] criticised what he considered racism in responses to the assaults and German rape laws, stating sardonically that "we rather abuse "our" women ourselves."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Jakob Augstein|url=http://www.spiegel.de/politik/deutschland/koeln-wenn-sexismus-und-rassismus-sich-treffen-kolumne-a-1071403.html|title=Lust der Angst|trans-title=Lust of fear|work=Spiegel|accessdate=14 August 2016|quote='Unsere' Frauen missbrauchen wir bitte selbst.

After the attacks, a January 2016 edition of French satirical magazine ''[[Charlie Hebdo]]'' included a cartoon by [[Riss (cartoonist)|Riss]] about [[Death of Alan Kurdi|Alan Kurdi]], a three-year-old [[Refugees of the Syrian Civil War|Syrian refugee]] who drowned as his family tried to reach Europe. In a controversial act, the cartoon satirised fickle and reactionary sentiment towards refugees by including a caption questioning whether the boy would have grown up to be an "ass groper in Germany".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/the-charlie-hebdo-cartoon-about-aylan-kurdi-and-sex-attackers-is-one-of-its-most-powerful-and-a6812346.html|title=The Charlie Hebdo cartoon about Aylan Kurdi and sex attackers is one of its most powerful|author=Jessica Brown|date=14 January 2016|accessdate=20 June 2016|work=The Independent}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Charlie Hebdo cartoon depicts grown-up Aylan Kurdi as 'ass groper in Germany'|url = https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/charlie-hebdo-sparks-new-controversy-with-cartoon-depicting-aylan-kurdi-as-an-ass-groper-in-germany-a6810331.html|work = The Independent|date = 14 January 2016|accessdate = 20 June 2016|language = en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title = Charlie Hebdo cartoon depicting drowned child Alan Kurdi sparks racism debate|url = https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/jan/14/charlie-hebdo-cartoon-depicting-drowned-child-alan-kurdi-sparks-racism-debate|newspaper = The Guardian|date = 14 January 2016|accessdate = 20 June 2016|issn = 0261-3077|language = en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Charlie Hebdo backlash over 'racist' Alan Kurdi cartoon - BBC News|url = https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-35306906|work = BBC News|accessdate = 20 June 2016|language = en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A viral video was made, [[doxing|containing the personal details]] of one of the victims and accusing her of making false allegations to spread anti-Muslim propaganda. The video circulated among German Islamic extremists, including [[Pierre Vogel]]. The victim, fearing reprisals, managed to get the video removed by telling its creator that she was prepared for legal action.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Online-Hetze gegen Selina|trans-title=Online incitement against Selina|url=http://www.swr.de/landesschau-rp/nach-silvester-uebergriffen-in-koeln-online-hetze-gegen-selina/-/id=122144/did=16735818/nid=122144/1w1qteu/index.html|accessdate=14 January 2016|publisher=SWR|date=12 January 2016|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===International reaction===
There were reports of tourists cancelling trips to Cologne in the aftermath of the attacks, including one tour group calling off their entire summer schedule in the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Eleanor Ross|title=Tourists cancel trips to Cologne fearing 'life and limb' after claims of 1,000 men attacking 100 women on New Year's Eve|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/tourists-cancel-trips-to-cologne-fearing-life-and-limb-a6800151.html|accessdate=7 January 2016|work=The Independent|date=7 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Belgium]]'s immigration minister ordered migrants to participate in "respect for women" courses in order to calm public opinion over the sex attacks.&lt;ref name="telegraph.co.uk"/&gt; The [[Deputy Prime Minister of the Netherlands]] and Minister for Social Affairs [[Lodewijk Asscher]] condemned Henriette Reker for implying that women could have prevented the attacks on themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Janene Pieters|title=DUTCH CABINET, MPS ANGERED BY COLOGNE MAYOR'S MASS SEX ASSAULT REMARKS|url=http://www.nltimes.nl/2016/01/06/dutch-cabinet-mps-angered-by-cologne-mayors-mass-sex-assault-remarks|accessdate=10 January 2016|publisher=NL Times|date=6 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Pope Francis]] acknowledged that Europeans had the right to be concerned over terrorism and changes to "cultural and social structures" via immigration, but stated that Europe "has the means to defend the centrality of the human person and to find the right balance between its twofold moral responsibility to protect the rights of its citizens and to ensure assistance and acceptance to migrants".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Pope urges Europe to find balance between security and refugee plight|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/pope-francis-urges-europe-to-find-the-right-balance-between-protecting-citizens-and-accepting-migrants/2016/01/11/c8094fa2-b842-11e5-99f3-184bc379b12d_story.html|accessdate=11 January 2016|work=The Washington Post|date=11 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Prime Minister of Hungary]] [[Viktor Orbán]] issued a call for immediate halt of all immigration to Europe and establishment of "European defence line" on Greece's northern borders with [[Republic of Macedonia|Macedonia]] and [[Bulgaria]].&lt;ref name="telegraph.co.uk"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/germany/12090388/Europe-in-crisis-over-sex-attacks-by-migrants-amid-calls-for-emergency-EU-meeting.html|title=Europe in crisis over sex attacks by migrants amid calls for emergency EU meeting|work=The Daily Telegraph|date=9 January 2016|accessdate=11 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Poland)|Poland's Foreign Minister]] [[Witold Waszczykowski]] sent an official letter to [[Frank-Walter Steinmeier]], the [[Minister for Foreign Affairs (Germany)|German Minister of Foreign Affairs]], asking if there were any Polish citizens hurt during the events. Waszczykowski criticized the German authorities for their handling of the situation. He also stated that it is likely that the German government tried to conceal the events and ban people from telling others about these events. Waszczykowski added that, in his view, the migration wave to Europe (which he linked to the events) was used by the [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant|Islamic State]] or other terrorist organizations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://polska.newsweek.pl/spotkanie-kaczynski-orban-w-zielonej-owieczce-i-ataki-w-kolonii,artykuly,376809,1.html|title=Spotkanie Kaczyński Orban w Zielonej Owieczce i ataki w Kolonii|trans-title=The meeting Kaczynski Orban in Green lamb and attacks in Cologne|work=Newsweek|accessdate=31 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wyborcza.pl/1,75478,19440631,waszczykowski-pisze-do-szefa-msz-niemiec-w-sprawie-atakow-na.html|title=Waszczykowski pisze do szefa MSZ Niemiec w sprawie ataków na kobiety w Kolonii: Szanowny panie ministrze, drogi kolego...|trans-title=Waszczykowski wrote to the German Foreign Minister on the attacks on women in Cologne: Dear Minister, dear fellow ...|publisher=Wyborcza.pl|accessdate=31 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a letter sent by [[Polish Minister of Justice]] [[Zbigniew Ziobro]] to German EU commissioner [[Günther Oettinger]] on 9 January, Ziobro stated that information about these events was concealed by German media and that there is censorship in Germany.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wyborcza.pl/1,75477,19451139,zbigniew-ziobro-w-liscie-otwartym-do-komisarza-guenthera-oettingera.html|title=Zbigniew Ziobro w liście otwartym do komisarza Guenthera Oettingera: "Nie mam pańskiego tupetu"|trans-title=Zbigniew Ziobro in an open letter to Commissioner Guenther Oettinger: "I have Your gall"|work=Wyborcza.pl|accessdate=31 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prime Minister of [[Slovakia]] [[Robert Fico]] called for an emergency summit of EU in the wake of the attacks, and declared he will act to stop Muslim refugees from entering the country. Fico stated, "We don't want something like what happened in Germany taking place in Slovakia." Czech Prime Minister [[Bohuslav Sobotka]] issued a statement supporting Slovakia's proposal.&lt;ref name="dw.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dw.com/en/after-cologne-slovakian-pm-fico-seeks-emergency-eu-summit/a-18968266|title=After Cologne, Slovakian PM Fico seeks emergency EU summit|work=Deutsche Welle|date=8 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Analysis==
The sexual assaults were compared by several newspapers and authorities like [[Federal Criminal Police Office (Germany)|German Federal Criminal Police Office (BKA)]] with attacks on women reported after the [[Arab Spring]] in numerous public places in [[Cairo]], especially [[Tahrir Square]], the most prominent victim of which was television journalist and correspondent [[Lara Logan]]. Egyptian women and, in some cases, foreign journalists were surrounded by groups of young men, often having been touched with sexual intent and partly undressed, or stripped naked and gang-raped.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=80 sexual assaults in one day – the other story of Tahrir Square|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jul/05/egypt-women-rape-sexual-assault-tahrir-square|work=The Guardian|accessdate=11 January 2016|author=Patrick Kingsley}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.welt.de/vermischtes/article150593304/Ploetzlich-spuerte-ich-eine-Hand-an-meinem-Po.html|title=Plötzlich spürte ich eine Hand an meinem Po|trans-title=Suddenly I felt a hand on my butt|work=Welt.de|date=4 January 2016|accessdate=24 January 2016}}{{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.berliner-zeitung.de/meinung/kommentar-zu-uebergriffen-in-koeln-mit-hartem-vorgehen-gegen-die-taeter-faengt-die-gegenwehr-erst-an,10808020,33064550.html|title=Mit hartem Vorgehen gegen die Täter fängt die Gegenwehr erst an|trans-title=With a crackdown on perpetrators, the resistance is just beginning|work=[[Berliner Zeitung]]|date=4 January 2016|accessdate=24 January 2016}}{{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.emma.de/artikel/koeln-frauen-berichten-emma-vom-terror-331129|title=Frauen berichten EMMA vom Terror|trans-title=Women tell EMMA about the terror|work=[[EMMA (magazine)|Emma]]|accessdate=4 January 2016}}{{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a report on the Cologne events published by the BKA—and as cited by ''[[Die Welt]]'' on 10 January—the phenomenon is known in some North African/Middle eastern countries as ''taharrush gamea''. It was reported that "[t]he BKA knew from some Arab countries the phenomenon of jointly committed sexual harassment of women in public. This type of crime was called there 'taharrush gamea' ('communal sexual harassment')."&lt;ref name="welt3"/&gt;&lt;ref name="bbc11.01.2016"/&gt;

Some women said that the events should not become a "political football" or allow a focus only on non-German suspects, since German women had been fighting against sexual harassment at such celebrations and elsewhere for many years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Regev|first1=Dana|title=No one is asking the women in Cologne what they feel|url=http://www.dw.com/en/no-one-is-asking-the-women-in-cologne-what-they-feel/a-18964326|accessdate=9 January 2018|publisher=Deutsche Welle|date=6 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Ackerman|first1=Xanthe|last2=Asquith|first2=Christina|title=Reaction to Cologne Attacks Should Focus on Women's Rights|url=http://time.com/4173102/cologne-attacks-womens-rights/|accessdate=9 January 2018|publisher=Time|date=11 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 11 February, Jürgen Mathies, the new police chief of Cologne, stated:

&lt;blockquote&gt;[Some perpetrators had made appointments for celebrations on New Year's Eve] on the social media. Some of them said there: 'We go to Cologne, there will be a big party.' There is no evidence that we are dealing with structures of [[organized crime]]. It is rather the case that the phenomenon of such sexual assaults out of groups is a massive problem in Cairo for example. The perpetrators probably knew from their home countries the behavior that women are encircled by many men at the same time and then abused. However, I did not know about this phenomenon in Germany so far.&lt;ref name="fc"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Questioned as to why most perpetrators in Cologne are not accused of sexual offences but of robbery and theft, Mathies replied, "It is easier to determine on the basis of video images: That person just took a cell phone away. Than: He has fingered a woman. These images are indeed anything but good."&lt;ref name="fc"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.focus.de/politik/deutschland/uebergriffe-an-silvester-koelner-polizeichef-uebergriffe-waren-keine-organisierte-kriminalitaet_id_5277005.html|title=Kölner Polizeichef: Sex-Übergriffe waren keine organisierte Kriminalität|trans-title=Cologne police chief: sexual assaults were not organized crime|work=[[Focus (German magazine)|Focus]]|accessdate=11 February 2016}}{{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2016, ''[[De Correspondent]]'' published an analysis of the events based on eye-witness accounts, concluding that:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://thecorrespondent.com/4401/time-for-the-facts-what-do-we-know-about-cologne-four-months-later/1073698080444-e20ada1b|title=Time for the facts. What do we know about Cologne four months later?|date=2 May 2016|author1=Laura Martz|author2=Erica Moore|website=The Correspondent|access-date=21 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The bottom line in our reconstruction, though, is that the initial impression of a mob of 1,000 refugees going after the women of Germany never went away. And an entire group of people continues to be associated with crimes it had nothing to do with. Based on what we know so far, a more accurate description of what happened last New Year's Eve might be: several dozen young men, many of North African origin, are suspected of sexually assaulting and robbing hundreds of women in the crowd. The crimes were made possible by the crowded New Year's Eve conditions in and around Cologne's main train station. They appear to have been further facilitated by poor coordination among the different police forces responsible for responding to the situation.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Polyandry]] is a marital arrangement in which a woman has several husbands. In [[Tibet]], those husbands are often brothers; "fraternal polyandry". Concern over which children are fathered by which brother falls on the wife alone. She may or may not say who the father is because she does not wish to create conflict in the family or is unsure who the biological father is.&lt;ref name="Gielen, U. P. 1993"&gt;{{cite book |last=Gielen |first=Uwe |title=Gender roles in traditional Tibetan cultures |year=1998 |journal= In L.L Adler (Ed.), International handbook on gender roles. Westport, CT: Greenwood.|pages=413–437 .}}&lt;/ref&gt; Historically the social system compelled marriage within a social class.

When the [[China|People's Republic of China]] [[Battle of Chamdo|annexed Tibet]], political systems in many regions of Tibet remained unchanged until, between 1959 and 1960, political reforms changed the land ownership and taxation systems.&lt;ref&gt;Childs (2003) p.429&lt;/ref&gt; Professor Melvyn Goldstein believed this affected Tibet's traditional marriage system. With the change in social stratification the ''du-jung'' and the ''mi-bo'' lower classes were the first to avoid the forms of marriage that characterized the older society.

Since 1981, the [[Tibet Autonomous Region]] government no longer permits new polyandric marriages under [[family law]]. Even though it is currently illegal, after [[collective farming]] was phased out and the farmed land reverted in the form of long-term leases to individual families, polyandry in Tibet is ''de facto'' the norm in rural areas.

==Rationale behind polyandry==
Studies have attempted to explain the existence of polyandry in Tibet. One reason put forward in traditional literature is that by not allowing land to be split between brothers, Tibetan families retained farms sufficiently large to continue supporting their family. Another reason for polyandry is that the mountainous terrain makes some of the farm land difficult to farm, requiring more physical strength. Women take multiple husbands because they are strong and able to help tend their land.

==Historical social stratification and family structure==
{{Main|Social classes of Tibet}}
The Tibetan social organization under Lhasa control from the 17th century on was quasi-feudal, in that arable land was divided and owned by [[Aristocracy|aristocratic]] families, religious organizations, and the central government and the population was subject to those district divisions. The population was further divided into social classes: 
* aristocratic lords (''ger-ba'')&lt;ref name="Goldstein71"&gt;Goldstein (1971) pp.65-66&lt;/ref&gt;
* monastics (as much as 20% of the population&lt;ref&gt;Goldstein, Melvyn C. (Nov 1981) ''New Perspectives on Tibetan Fertility and Population Decline'' American Ethnologist, Vol. 8, No. 4, pp. 721-738&lt;/ref&gt;)
* subjects (''mi-ser'')&lt;ref name="Childs"&gt;Childs (2003) pp.427-428&lt;/ref&gt; consisting of:
** taxpayer families (''tre-ba''&lt;ref name="Goldstein71" /&gt; or ''khral-pa''&lt;ref name="Childs" /&gt;&lt;ref name="GoldsteinMay1871"&gt;Goldstein (May 1971) p.524&lt;/ref&gt;)
** householders (''du-jong''&lt;ref name="Goldstein71" /&gt; or ''dud-chung-ba''&lt;ref name="Childs" /&gt;&lt;ref name="GoldsteinMay1871" /&gt;)
** landless peasants (''mi-bo''&lt;ref name="Goldstein71" /&gt;)

===Taxpayer families===
These wealthier family units hereditarily owned estates leased from their district authority, complete with [[Title (property)|land titles]]. In Goldstein's research about the Gyantse district specifically, he found them owning typically from {{convert|20|acre|m2}} to {{convert|300|acre|km2}} of land each. Their primary civil responsibility was to pay [[tax]]es (''tre-ba'' and ''khral-pa'' means "taxpayer"), and to supply [[corvée]] services that included both human and animal labor to their district authority.&lt;ref name="Childs" /&gt; According to Goldstein, the entire family structure and marriage system were subordinated to serve the land and corporate family unit.

The family structure and marriage system of ''tre-ba'' were characterized by two fundamental principles:  
* the corporate stem family; and 
* the mono-marital principle.

A "stem family" is one in which a married child is inextricably linked to his natal family in ''a common household''. The "mono-marital principle" dictates that for each and every generation, one and only one marriage is permitted collectively among all the male siblings, and the children born out of this marriage are members of the family unit who have full legal rights.

The family organization was based on these two patterns to avoid the partitioning of their estates. A generation with two or more [[wiktionary:Conjugal|conjugal]] families was seen as unstable because it could produce serious conflicts that could divide their corporate family land. As a matter of fact, Tibetan [[inheritance]] rules of family land, mainly based on [[Agnatic seniority|agnatic]] links, did provide for each generation to partition the land between brothers, but this was ignored to prevent the estate unit from being threatened. Polygamous marriage, therefore arose as a solution to this potential threat.

To elucidate, let us consider a family with two or more sons. Tibetan inheritance rules gave all males of the family, the right to claim a part of the family estate, so if each son took a different [[bride]], there would be different conjugal families, and this would lead to the partitioning of the land among the different sons' families. To avoid this situation, the solution was a [[#Fraternal polyandry|fraternal polyandrous marriage]], where the brothers would share a bride. Bi-fraternal polyandrous marriages were more common than tri-fraternal or quadri-fraternal polyandry, because the latter forms of marriage were often characterized by severe familial tensions (reference missing). Different mechanisms were employed to reduce the number of sons within a household, such as making one son a [[celibate]] [[monk]], or sending away a son to become  an adoptive [[bridegroom]] to a family without male children.

Another kind of marriage, although uncommon, is the "polygynous marriage". In a family where all the children were female, sisterly polygynous marriage represented the most common choice. In traditional inheritance rules, only males had rights over the land, but where there were no males to inherit them, the daughters had the right over the corporation’s land. To maintain the familial estate unit, the daughters would share a bridegroom who will move [[Matrilocality|matrilocally]] (as opposed to the [[Patrilocality|patrilocal]] principle where the brides move into the husband's family) and become a member of his wife's family.

Bigenerational polygamy was present as an application of the mono-marital principle. Let us consider a family in which the mother died before the son was married. If the widower remarried another woman, two conjugal families would have been created, leading to the eventual partition of the estate. Bigenerational polyandry, whereby the father shared a wife with his son, was therefore the solution to avoid this problem. Conversely, when a woman with no male offspring was [[widow]]ed, she would share a husband with her daughter ("bigenerational polygyny"), thus avoiding land partitioning (reference missing).

In these mono-marital stem families, the family head, who had a dominant role in the family, was called ''trong bey abo'' (or simply ''abo''). The ''abo'' who managed the property and resources of the family unit, was always a male, and almost invariably the oldest male of the elder generation in power. Sometimes, a younger brother would assume the ''abo'' role when the eldest male retired.

In taxpayer families, polyandrous and monogamist marriage were the more common forms of marriage, while much less widespread was the polygynous marriage. Bigenerational forms of polyandry were, however, very rare.

===Householders===
The householder class ([[Duiqoin|''du-jung'']] or ''dud-chung-ba''&lt;ref name="Childs" /&gt;) comprised peasants who held only small plots of land that were legally and literally "individual" possessions. Land inheritance rules were different from taxpayer families, determined by the district authority and not strictly hereditary to the family unit.

The householder family structure &amp;mdash; unlike the taxpayer families &amp;mdash; lacked the single marriage per generation requirement to avoid land parceling. When a son married he often established a new household and split off from the original family unit. If taxpayer sons married that created succession for the family corporation and bound them to the estate for [[Property|patrimonial]] and land reasons. Householder marriages did not incur that responsibility, and they generally married for love and were more often monogamist. The small number of polyandry cases within the householder class were limited to only the wealthier families.

===Landless peasants===
The landless peasants (''mi-bo'') were not obligated to and did not have any heritable rights to land. Like the householders, they tended to have less polyandry than the taxpayer families.

==Fraternal polyandry==
As has been seen, fraternal polyandry was a form of marriage that was prevalent among the ''tre-ba'' class. Traditionally, marriages were arranged by the parents, often when the children were still very young. As ''tre-ba'' marriages were decided for patrimonial reasons, the brides' and bridegrooms' personal preferences were of no consequence. In polyandrous conjugal family, the eldest brother was, more often than not, the dominant person in the household. All the other brothers, however, shared the work equally, and had the right to [[Human sexual behavior|sexual relations]] with their common wife, who had to treat them equally.

All children were treated equally, and a "father" was not allowed to show any favoritism, even if he knew who his biological children really were, as biological [[Parent|paternity]] was not regarded as important. Similarly, the children considered all their uncles as their fathers, and a child avoided treating members of the elder generation differently, even if they knew who their biological father was. The children would usually only address the eldest surviving husband as "father"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=潘东 |title=揭秘一妻多夫的西藏婚姻 |url=http://env.people.com.cn/GB/16703307.html |accessdate=31 July 2018 |publisher=people.com.cn |date=2011 |language=Chinese}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

[[Divorce]] was quite simple. If one of the brothers in a polyandrous marriage felt displeased, he only had to leave the household. Polyandrous marriages were often characterized by tensions and clashes for a variety of different reasons. For example, conflicts might arise because a younger brother wanted to contest the authority of his eldest brother; sometimes, sexual favoritism might occur, generating tension among the male partners in the marriage, especially so when there were significant age differences among the brothers.

==Current status==
Polyandry declined rapidly in the first decade after the establishment of [[Tibet Autonomous Region]], and was banned during the [[Cultural Revolution]] as part of the "[[Four Olds]]". However, it regained popularity in the 1980s as the policies relaxed and the [[people's commune]] system broke down. A 1988 survey by the [[Tibet University]] throughout Tibet found that 13.3% of families were polyandric, and 1.7% were [[polygyny|polygynous]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Ma |first1=Rong |title=试论藏族的“一妻多夫”婚姻 |journal=《民族学报》 |date=2000 |issue=6 |url=http://www.mzb.com.cn/res/Home/0904/1/%E8%97%8F%E6%97%8F%E5%A9%9A%E5%A7%BB.pdf |accessdate=31 July 2018 |language=Chinese}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Currently, polyandry is present in all Tibetan areas, but particularly common in some rural regions of [[Ü-Tsang|Tsang]] and [[Kham]] that are faced with extreme living conditions&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Zhu |first1=Suli |title=藏区的一妻多夫制 |journal=《法律与社会科学》 |date=2014 |volume=13 |issue=2 |pages=15 |url=http://www.oaj.pku.edu.cn/lss/CN/Y2014/V13/I2/1#1 |accessdate=31 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;. A 2008 study of several villages in [[Xigaze Prefecture|Xigaze]] and [[Qamdo Prefecture|Qamdo]] prefectures found that 20-50% of the families were polyandric, with the majority having two husbands. For some remote settlements, the number was as high as 90%&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Suozhen|title=西藏一妻多夫婚姻研究 |date=2009 |publisher=China University of Political Science and Law |url=http://xuewen.cnki.net/ArticleCatalog.aspx?filename=2009087442.nh&amp;dbtype=CMFD&amp;dbname=CMFD2009 |accessdate=31 July 2018 |language=Chinese}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Polyandry is very rare among urban residents or non-agricultural households.

A regulation issued by government of Tibet Autonomous Region in 1981 approved all polygamous marriages before the date of implementation, but not those formed after the date, with no prosecution for violating it. In practice, such a family would be registered as a monogamous family between the wife and the eldest husband&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Zhang |first1=Kai |title=西藏一妻多夫婚姻习俗与国法的冲突和调适 |journal=《西藏发展论坛》 |date=2012 |issue=6 |url=http://www.wanfangdata.com.cn/details/detail.do?_type=perio&amp;id=xzfzlt201206014 |accessdate=31 July 2018 |language=Chinese}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7028">The '''Prison Litigation Reform Act''' (PLRA), 42 U.S.C. § 1997e,&lt;ref&gt;Title VIII of {{uspl|104|134}}, {{usstat|110|1321|1996}}.&lt;/ref&gt; is a U.S. federal law that was enacted in 1996.&lt;ref&gt;P.L. 104-134, 110 Stat. 1321 (2006); 42 U.S.C. § 1997e (1994 ed. &amp; Supp. II).&lt;/ref&gt;  Congress enacted PLRA in response to a significant increase in prisoner litigation in the federal courts; the PLRA was designed to decrease the incidence of litigation within the court system.&lt;ref&gt;Woodford v. Ngo, 126 S. Ct. 2378, 2382 (2006) (Congress enacted the PLRA in 1996 in response to a significant increase in prisoner litigation in the federal court. To accomplish that goal, Congress included a "variety of provisions" in the PLRA, a "centerpiece" of which "is an 'onvigorated' exhaustion provision, § 1997e(a).")&lt;/ref&gt;

For the preceding 20 to 30 years, many US prisons and jails had been enjoined to make certain changes based on findings that the conditions of the institutions violated the constitutional rights of inmates (in particular, freedom from cruel and unusual punishment or the right to due process).

Many of the injunctions came as a result of consent decrees entered into between inmates and prison officials and endorsed by federal courts so relief was not necessarily tied to violations found. Many state officials and members of Congress had complained of the breadth of relief granted by federal judges, as the injunctions often required expensive remedial actions.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}

The PLRA was designed to curb the discretion of the federal courts in those types of actions. Thus, the central requirement of the act was a provision that a court "shall not grant or approve any prospective relief unless the court finds that such relief is narrowly drawn, extends no further than necessary to correct the violation of the Federal right, and is the least intrusive means necessary to correct the violation of the Federal right."&lt;ref&gt;18 U.S.C. § 3626(a)(1)(A). Under PLRA, the same criteria apply to existing injunctions, whether entered after trial or through approval of a consent decree. 18 U.S.C. § 3626(b)(3). To ensure that an injunction granting prospective
relief does not remain in effect for the months or years that a trial of a prison conditions case typically takes, the act
requires courts to rule " promptly" on motions to terminate prospective relief, with [[mandamus]] available to remedy
failure to do so.&lt;/ref&gt;

=="Automatic stay" section==

The most pointed provision of the PLRA in this context is the so-called "automatic stay" section, which states that a motion to terminate prospective relief "shall operate as a stay" of that relief for 30 days after the filing of the motion (extendable to up to 90 days for "good cause") and ending when the court rules on the motion.&lt;ref&gt;18 U.S.C. § 3626(e)(2). Thus, the statute expressly provided for the suspension of existing prospective relief within 30 days (or 90 days) from the filing of a motion to terminate the prospective relief. That suspension continues only until the court conducts a trial and makes the findings the act requires of it, but that period will be for an extended time because of the complexities of the trial that must be conducted.&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[Miller v. French]]'', 530 U.S. 327 (2000), inmates attacked the constitutionality of the "automatic stay" provision as a violation of separation of powers.&lt;ref&gt;See ''Plaut v. Spendthrift Farm, Inc.'', 514 U.S. 211 (1995); ''United States v. Klein'',80 U.S. 128 (1872).&lt;/ref&gt;

The Supreme Court reversed, 5–4, and held that the PLRA did not set aside a final judgment of a federal court. Rather, it operated to change the underlying law and so required the altering of the prospective relief issued under the old law.&lt;ref&gt;Miller v. French, 530 U.S. 327,341-50 (2000)&lt;/ref&gt; Also, the Court noted that separation of powers did not prevent Congress from changing applicable law and then imposing the consequences of the court's application of the new legal standard. Finally, the Court held that the stay provision did not interfere with core judicial functions, as it could not be determined whether the time limitations interfered with judicial functions by its relative brevity.

On the other hand, if the time limits interfered with the inmates' meaningful opportunity to be heard, that would be a due process problem.&lt;ref&gt;Miller v. French, 530 U.S. 327,350 (2000)&lt;/ref&gt; Since the decision below had been based on separation of powers, the due process argument was not before the Court. Thus, the constitutionality of the PLRA overall, and of the "automatic stay"  in particular, is still undetermined, but the Court seems disposed to a measure of acceptance.

===Exhaustion requirement===
Another way Congress tried to curb prison litigation was by setting up an "exhaustion" requirement.&lt;ref&gt;Tim Phillips, [http://activistdefense.wordpress.com/2013/06/01/activist-writes-graphic-novel-regarding-when-and-how-to-file-prison-grievances/ "Activist Writes Graphic Novel Regarding When and How to File Prison Grievances"], Activist Defense, June 1, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Before prisoners may challenge a condition of their confinement in federal court, the PLRA requires them first to exhaust available administrative remedies by pursuing to completion whichever inmate grievance and/or appeal procedures their prison custodians provide:
{{quote|No action shall be brought with respect to prison conditions under section 1983 of this title, or any other Federal law, by a prisoner confined in any jail, prison, or other correctional facility until such administrative remedies as are available are exhausted.|42 U.S.C. § 1997e(a)}}

That requirement was the subject of a Supreme Court case, ''[[Jones v. Bock]]''.

The exhaustion requirement has been widely criticized as imposing an inequitable burden on prisoners. Exhaustion must be in accordance with the administrative remedies procedure applicable to the facility in which a prisoner is confined. The procedures vary by state law and facility policy.

==Injunctions==

Some federal courts issue orders that certain prisoners and other ''pro se'' litigants cannot represent themselves in federal court.  However,  the 11th Circuit ruled, in 2011, that a prisoner can file any post conviction claim that he wants if he files through counsel or pays a filing fee.&lt;ref&gt;Shivers v. United States, Case No. 10-14336, (Unpublished Opinion, 11th Cir. 2011)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Procup V. Strickland, 792 F. 2d, 1069 (11th Cir. 1986)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Miller V. Donald, 541 F. 3d, 1091, 1096-97 (11th Cir. 2008)&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2513">A '''private community''' is a [[residential community]] that can be an [[Voluntary association|association]] or a [[Proprietary community|proprietary organization]]. Associations can include [[condominium]]s, [[homeowner association]]s or [[cooperative]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Spencer H. Macallum: "Suburban Democracy vs. Residential Community". ''Critical Review'', Vol 17, Nos. 3-4, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Whereas governmental communities are financed with [[taxation]], where taxes typically have little connection with benefits, private communities are financed as payments for benefits.  In a hotel, for example, the public goods such as [[elevator]]s and [[security]] are paid for from room charges.&lt;ref&gt;Spencer H. MacCallum: "[http://home.arcor.de/danneskjoeld/F/E/T/CommunitySHM_.htm The Enterprise of Community: Market Competition, Land, and Environment] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071215022008/http://home.arcor.de/danneskjoeld/F/E/T/CommunitySHM_.htm |date=2007-12-15 }}", Journal of Libertarian Studies, Volume 17, no. 4, Fall 2003, 1-16, published by [[Ludwig von Mises Institute]], Slightly amended by the author, June 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Georg Glasze, Chris Webster, Klaus Frantz, [https://books.google.com/books?id=u9MA4mjpMrMC ''Private Cities''], [[Routledge]], 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

One early American example was Lucas Place, laid out in 1851 in [[St. Louis, Missouri]], the first of about 50 such [[private place]]s unique to the city. Today, there are "60 million people who now live in roughly 300,000 private communities" in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/11/us/11clothesline.html?th&amp;emc=th&lt;/ref&gt;

A noteworthy Canadian example, [[Arbutus Ridge Retirement Community|Arbutus Ridge Seaside Community for Active Adults]] in the [[Cowichan Valley]] on [[Vancouver Island]] was the first comprehensive [[retirement community]] built in Canada. It subsequently became the template and proving ground for the now accepted and commonplace [[age-restricted community]].

[[Sex trafficking]] is a problem in the country.&lt;ref name="state17" /&gt;

==Legal situation==
Both [[prostitution]] itself and buying sex are prohibited by the Code of Administrative Offences.&lt;ref name="Europam"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Republic of Lithuania Code of Administrative Offences |url=http://europam.eu/data/mechanisms/PF/PF%20Laws/Lithuania/Lithuania_Code%20of%20administrative%20offences_1985_amended2016_eng.pdf |website=EuroPAM|accessdate=21 February 2018|date=1 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Related activities are prohibited by the Criminal Code.&lt;ref name="unodc"&gt;{{cite web|title=Criminal Code of the Republic of Lithuania|url=https://www.unodc.org/res/cld/document/ltu/criminal_code_of_lithuania_html/Lithuania_Criminal_Code_2000_as_amd_2010.pdf|website=[[United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime]]|accessdate=21 February 2018|date=11 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Public order laws are also used against prostitutes.&lt;ref name="spl"&gt;{{cite web|title=Sex Work Law - Countries|url=http://spl.ids.ac.uk/sexworklaw/countries|website=Sexuality, Poverty and Law|accessdate=21 February 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Code of Administrative Offences===
Prostitution itself and the clients of prostitutes are criminalised by Article 182&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; of the Administrative Code. The penalty is a fine of €86 to €144 for a single offence and €144 to €288 for repeat offences. Repeat offenders may also be subject to administrative arrest for up to thirty days&lt;ref name="Europam" /&gt;

===Criminal Code===
The following are offences under the criminal code:&lt;ref name="unodc" /&gt;
: Article 307. Gaining Profit from Another Person’s Prostitution
:: 1. Profit from another person’s prostitution or from [[procuring (prostitution)|procuration]] for prostitution (maximum sentence 4 years imprisonment)
:: 2. Organises or is in charge of prostitution or transports a person with his consent for prostitution into or out of Lithuania (max 6 years)

{{see also|Human trafficking in Lithuania}}
[[Lithuania]] is a source, transit, and destination country for women and girls subjected to sex trafficking. Observers estimate 40 percent of identified Lithuanian trafficking victims are women and girls subjected to sex trafficking within the country. Lithuanian women are also subjected to sex trafficking in [[Western Europe]] and [[Scandinavia]]. [[Vietnam]]ese adults and children transiting through Lithuania may be trafficking victims. The approximately 4,000 boys and girls institutionalised in more than 95 orphanages are especially vulnerable to trafficking.&lt;ref name="state17"&gt;{{cite web|title=Lithuania 2017 Trafficking in Persons Report|url=https://www.state.gov/j/tip/rls/tiprpt/countries/2017/271229.htm|website=U.S. Department of State|accessdate=21 February 2018}}{{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Articles 147 and 157 of the criminal code prohibit all forms of trafficking and prescribe penalties ranging from two to 12 years imprisonment.&lt;ref name="state17" /&gt;

In March 2015, prosecutors announced an investigation into allegations that the director of an orphanage sexually exploited boys and operated a sex trafficking ring inside the institution, offering young boys to [[paedophile]]s. The investigation remained ongoing during the reporting period. In January 2015, prosecutors announced the investigation of a state-run residential institution for children with special needs; teenage residents allegedly had been subjecting girl residents to sex trafficking. The orphanage’s director defended her institution by saying such activity is common at all Lithuanian orphanages. In March 2017, the court sentenced four men to two to four and a half years in jail for sex with juvenile residents of this orphanage and imposed one to three years probation sentences to four girls for facilitating prostitution. Prosecutors will appeal the decision asking the higher instance court to sentence the criminals for human trafficking.&lt;ref name="state17" /&gt;

The [[United States Department of State]] [[Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons]] ranks Lithuania as a '[[Trafficking in Persons Report#Ranking System|Tier 1]]' country.&lt;ref name="state17" /&gt;

'''Prostitution in Ireland''' is legal. However, since March 2017, it has been an offence to buy sex.&lt;ref name="enact"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Edwards|first1=Elaine|title=Minister for Justice signs new laws on sexual offences|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/news/crime-and-law/minister-for-justice-signs-new-laws-on-sexual-offences-1.3026288|website=The Irish Times|accessdate=14 April 2018|date=March 27, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Third party involvement (such as operating [[brothels]], and other forms of [[pimping]]) is also illegal.&lt;ref name="clsoa93"&gt;{{cite web|title=Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Act, 1993|url=http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/1993/act/20/enacted/en/html|website=electronic Irish Statute Book (eISB)|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the 2017 law criminalising clients was designed to reduce the demand for [[prostitution]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Farrell|first1=Alan|title=Opinion: Buying a woman's body for sexual gratification is not a harmless act|url=http://www.thejournal.ie/readme/sex-workers-in-ireland-1896233-Jan2015/|website=TheJournal.ie|accessdate=14 April 2018|language=en|date=25 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; as of 2018 the law has had little effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=MacNamee|first1=Garreth|title=Buying sex has been illegal in Ireland for one year but 'very little' has changed|url=http://www.thejournal.ie/sex-workers-ireland-laws-3865840-Feb2018/|website=TheJournal.ie|accessdate=14 April 2018|language=en|date=23 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most prostitution in [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]] occurs indoors and is advertised via the Internet. [[Street prostitution]] has declined considerably.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gallagher|first1=Conor|title='It's clearly a brothel, yet nothing can be done'|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/news/social-affairs/it-s-clearly-a-brothel-yet-nothing-can-be-done-1.3168979|website=The Irish Times|accessdate=14 April 2018|date=29 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
=== Eighteenth century ===
Prostitution was both highly visible and pervasive in 18th-century [[Dublin]], centred on [[Temple Bar, Dublin|Temple Bar]] and reflected the whole spectrum of [[socioeconomic class]], from street prostitutes, through organised [[brothels]] to high class courtesans, who were often illegitimate daughters of the upper class. A well known example was Margaret Leeson. The role of the prostitute in 18th-century Ireland was at least partly a product of the double standard of female sexuality. Typical of this was the way that [[venereal disease]] was constructed as being spread by prostitutes rather than their largely male clients. Irish prostitutes were frequently the victims of [[violence against women]]. Early 'rescue' campaigns emerged in this time with [[Lady Arabella Denny]] and the [[Magdalene laundries in Ireland|Magdalene Asylums]]. These provided shelter but in return expected menial labour and penitence.&lt;ref name=Oreilly/&gt;

=== Nineteenth century ===
The changing nature of Irish society following the 1801 [[Acts of Union 1800|Act of Union]] saw a redefining of the status of women, with an idealisation of [[nuns]] at one extreme and a marginalisation of prostitutes at the other. Yet it was estimated that there were 17,000 women working as prostitutes in Dublin alone, and a further 8 brothels in [[Cork (city)|Cork]]. Dublin's sex trade was largely centred on the [[Monto]] district, reputedly the largest [[red light district]] in Europe.&lt;ref name=Oreilly/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite newspaper|url=http://www.independent.ie/style/sex-relationships/redlight-alert-26722484.html|title=Red-light alert|author=|date=10 April 2011|newspaper=Independent}}&lt;/ref&gt; A major part of the demand came from the large number of [[British army]] military personnel stationed in Ireland at the time. The ‘Wrens of the Curragh’, for instance were a group of some sixty women working as ‘army camp followers’ around the [[Curragh]].&lt;ref name=Oreilly/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.curragh.info/articles/wrens.htm|title=The Curragh Wrens|author=Con Costello|date=|website=The Curragh History Web Site|accessdate=12 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=An outcast community:the 'wrens' of the curragh|first=Maria|last=Luddy|date=1 September 1992|journal=[[Women's History Review]]|volume=1|issue=3|pages=341–355|doi=10.1080/09612029200200014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Increasing concern regarding venereal disease, particularly as a threat to the military led to the introduction of a series of [[Contagious Diseases Acts]] in the 1860s, enabling authorities to apprehend and detain any woman suspected of prostitution and force her to submit to examination for disease. As in many other countries opposition to the Acts, provided a rallying cry for emerging women's movements. [[Anna Haslam]] in Dublin and [[Isabella Tod]] in Belfast, both of the [[Ladies National Association for the Repeal of the Contagious Diseases Acts|Ladies National Association]], organised opposition and a recognition not only of the plight of these women but also of the root causes.&lt;ref name=Oreilly/&gt;

=== Twentieth century ===
Emerging nationalism tended to see prostitution and venereal disease as legacies of colonialism that could be resolved through independence. This movement became linked to Catholic conservatism which demanded [[social purification]] of the pure Irish soul. Thus the 1920s saw the decline of [[Monto]], as the [[Legion of Mary]] founded and led by [[Frank Duff]] successfully crusaded to close down the brothels of Monto and bring religion to the area. Prostitution continued to exist in the form of individual women selling sexual services on the streets in cities, but it was a long time before organised prostitution was seen again.&lt;ref name=Fagan/&gt; However, street prostitution remained intrinsically linked to the Dublin Underworld. The 1920s and 1930s witnessed a new era Church-State morality and censorship. The Magdalene Asylums became more punitive, imprisoning young women who transgressed conventional sexual morality, some for the duration of their lives, the last asylum closing only in 1996.&lt;ref name=Oreilly/&gt;

The Criminal Law Amendment Act 1935&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1935/en/act/pub/0006/index.html|title=Criminal Law Amendment Act 1935 (No. 6 1935)|first=|last=|date=|website=Electronic Irish Statute Book|publisher=Office of the Attorney General|accessdate=12 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ward/&gt; prohibited contraception and required sex crimes cases to be tried ''in camera'', preventing media coverage and contributing to the illusion of Irish purity. In the 1950s there was much public attention around the plight of Irish women working as prostitutes in England. These were portrayed not so much as 'fallen' women, but rather as innocents lured into evil. The Women's Liberation Movement of the 1970s helped to expose the double standards. Notable was the story of [[June Levine]] who collaborated with Lyn Madden, a former Dublin sex worker for twenty years in the 70s and 80s, to write ''Lyn: A Story of Prostitution'' (1987)&lt;ref name=Oreilly/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.corkuniversitypress.com/SearchResults.asp?Search=lyn&amp;Submit= ''Lyn: A Story of Prostitution''], by June Levine and Lyn Madden, Cork University Press (1987) {{ISBN|9780946211456}}&lt;/ref&gt; Madden had seen her lover and pimp John Cullen firebomb the home of former sex worker and women's rights activist Dolores Lynch. Lynch perished in the fire together with her elderly mother and aunt. Madden denounced Culen and began writing the book during the ensuing trial, at which Cullen received eighteen years imprisonment. At around this time a group of street sex workers brought a successful supreme court challenge to the constitutionality of Victorian laws that required a defendant to first be identified as a common prostitute through the citing of previous convictions before conviction was possible. This successful challenge created a situation of effective decriminalisation, that also offered the women the same access to the protection of the law as anyone else. During this period prostitutes were largely independent and had a good relationship with the Gardaí. Pimping was almost unheard of, as were the other crimes previously associated with prostitution. Any suggestion of organised prostitution was limited to a small number of massage parlours in an environment where the workers were empowered to negotiate favourable terms and conditions for themselves. Also improving economic conditions and a weakening force of the Church allowed for a more visible and largely tolerated sex industry.&lt;ref name=Oreilly/&gt;

The Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Act 1993,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1993/en/act/pub/0020/index.html|title=Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Act 1993 (No. 20  1993)|first=|last=|date=|website=Electronic Irish Statute Book|publisher=Office of the Attorney General|accessdate=12 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; made soliciting an offence for both prostitute and customer and independent prostitution declined as the women were forced into the massage parlours to avoid arrest, where they were now disempowered by necessity and terms and conditions rapidly declined. By the late 1990s the age of the brothel, and the brothel-keeper, had truly returned.  Society seemed accepting of discreet, indoor prostitution establishments and every week the mainstream entertainment magazine ''In Dublin'' ran advertisements for escort services and 'massage parlouirs' (brothels), which were usually the business operations of a small number of men and women, who knew running brothels was illegal, but were prepared to take the risk, given the massive profits involved. The magazine earned substantial revenue from these advertisements.&lt;ref name=Oreilly/&gt;

The blatant wealth of Ireland's brothel-keepers in the 1990s was such that the media began to take more interest.&lt;ref name=Oreilly/&gt; Section 23 of the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act 1994&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1994/en/act/pub/0002/index.html|title=Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act 1994 (No. 2  1994) |first=|last=|date=|website=Electronic Irish Statute Book|accessdate=12 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; prohibited the advertising of brothels and prostitution and in 1999 the [[Censorship of Publications Board]] banned ''In Dublin'' magazine from carrying escort advertisements.  Criminal proceedings were also brought against the magazine's publisher, Mike Hogan.  The ''In Dublin'' magazine case heralded the end of escort advertising in print publications. However, the suppression of advertising had little effect as the internet and mobile phones were changing the nature of the trade. Ireland's first escort website, ''Escort Ireland'', had already established itself the previous year to take over ''In Dublin'' magazine's role.&lt;ref name=Oreilly/&gt;

Of note was the frequent reference to the inadequacy of the existing legislation, but there was little debate about possible alternative models.&lt;ref name=Oreilly/&gt;  While Ireland has an international commitment to protecting the well-being of women trafficked to Ireland for the purposes of prostitution, there was little or no discussion about the rights and well-being of Irish women working in prostitution. The violent murders of prostitutes Belinda Pereira, a UK resident working for a Dublin escort agency on 28 December 1996&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/NEW+PLEA+IN+HUNT+FOR+BELINDA+KILLER%3B+Prostitute+led+double+life.-a0140189010 | title=NEW PLEA IN HUNT FOR BELINDA KILLER |author=Nicola Tallant |publisher=The Mirror |date=28 December 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Sinead Kelly&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/We+knew+prostitute+would+be+murdered+..we+told+the+gardai%3B+Hunt+for...-a060675345 | title=We knew prostitute would be murdered |author=Unknown |publisher=The Mirror |date=23 June 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; a young street prostitute in 1998 caused questions to be raised about the benefits of the 1993 act. Until Belinda Periera was murdered in a city centre apartment in the winter of 1996, the last murder of a prostitute while working (Dolores Lynch was murdered in her home in 1983, and seems to have no longer been working as a prostitute at the time) was in 1925 when the body of Lily O'Neill (known as "Honor Bright") was found in the Dublin Mountains.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://karlwhitney.com/dumbriffs/tag/honor-bright/ | title="Honor Bright" and "Death in a Lonely Spot" | author=Karl Whitney | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029193423/http://karlwhitney.com/dumbriffs/tag/honor-bright/ | archivedate=29 October 2013 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

1999 also saw the launch of Operation Gladiator, a police operation targeting those who profit from organised prostitution.  It was the first operation of its type and lasted under a year, but in that time it identified and built cases against several major Dublin brothel-keepers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Reynolds | first = Paul | title = Sex in the City: The Prostitution Racket in Ireland |year = 2003 | isbn = 978-0-7171-3688-9 | id =  {{ASIN|0717136884|country=uk}} }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Twenty-first century ===
Operation Quest was launched by the [[Gardaí]] in 2003, with the aim of tackling human trafficking, prostitution and criminality within the lap dancing industry, followed by Operation Hotel in 2005, with the aim of tackling the trafficking of females from Eastern Europe to work in the sex industry in Ireland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.legislationline.org/download/action/download/id/1085/file/de59f69b3c816696e5b4bd04b849.pdf | title=Report on Trafficking in Human Beings |author=Equality &amp; Law Reform and An Garda Síochána Working Group |publisher=Department of Justice |date=May 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Essentially the legal framework has not changed over twenty years, but discussions about alternatives emerged in 2011 (see [[#Politics|Politics]]).

==Legal status==
Prostitution itself is not an offence under Irish law.  However, the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Act of 1993 prohibits soliciting or importuning another person in a street or public place for the purpose of prostitution (this offence applies to prostitute and client).  It also prohibits loitering for the purpose of prostitution, organising prostitution by controlling or directing the activities of a person in prostitution, coercing one to practice prostitution for gain, living on earnings of the prostitution of another person, and keeping a brothel or other premises for the purpose of prostitution.&lt;ref name="clsoa93" /&gt;

Advertising brothels and prostitution is prohibited by the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act of 1994.  The minimum legal age for a prostitute in Ireland is 18 years (child prostitution legislation exists to protect persons under this age). The Criminal Law (Trafficking in Persons and Sexual Offences) Bill 2006 came into force making trafficking in persons for the purpose of their sexual exploitation a specific offence, though previous legislation already covered much of this area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.irishstatutebook.ie | title=Irish Statute Book |publisher=Office of the Attorney General, Ireland}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://legislationline.org/download/action/download/id/1083/file/09056de652705d07ae75a8bf53ae.pdf | title=Criminal Law (Trafficking in Persons and Sexual Offences) Bill 2006 |publisher=Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights, Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="whichway" /&gt;

On 27 March 2017, the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Act 2017 was commenced into force.&lt;ref name="enact" /&gt; The Act significantly amends the 1993 Act to provide that a person who pays, gives, offers or promises to pay or give a person (including a prostitute) money or any other form of remuneration or consideration for the purpose of engaging in sexual activity with a prostitute shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable on conviction to a fine of up to €500 for a first offence, and a fine of up to €1,000 for each subsequent offence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2017/act/2/section/25/enacted/en/html#sec25|title=Amendment of Act of 1993|last=(eISB)|first=electronic Irish Statute Book|website=www.irishstatutebook.ie|language=en|access-date=2017-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Politics ==
Discussion of proposed law reform became an issue in the [[Irish general election, 2011|2011 elections]], with some support from opposition parties likely to become the new Government. A group of non-government and union bodies emerged pressuring both the current government and opposition parties to abolish prostitution, by criminalising the buying of sex, along [[Prostitution in Sweden|Swedish lines]].  At the same time, those supporting the ''status quo'' or advocating a more liberal approach challenged this argument.&lt;ref name=pressure&gt;[http://www.independent.ie/national-news/pressure-groups-lock-horns-over-changes-to-laws-on-prostitution-2548122.html "Pressure groups lock horns over changes to laws on prostitution"], Jim Cusack, ''Irish Independent'', 20 February 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.irishcentral.com/news/Irish-Justice-Minister-in-move-to-change-laws-on-purchase-of-sex-130965203.html "Irish Justice Minister in move to change laws on purchase of sex"], Cathal Dervan, ''Irish Central'', 3 October 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; In the ensuing [[Dáil]] election on 25 February, a new Government was formed by [[Fine Gael]] (70 seats) and [[Labour Party (Ireland)|Labour]] (34 seats). The women's branch of the Labour Party support criminalisation of purchase.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.labour.ie/download/pdf/labour_women_submission_on_the_review_of_legislation_on_prostitution_august_2012.pdf|title=Labour Women: Submission on the Review of Legislation on Prostitution|author=|date=August 2012|publisher=The Labour Party}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2012, the Department of Justice and Equality issued its ''Discussion Document on Future Direction of Prostitution Legislation''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.justice.ie/en/JELR/Pages/PB12000187|title=Discussion Document on Future Direction of Prostitution Legislation|first=|last=|date=|publisher=The Department of Justice and Equality|accessdate=12 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In September 2012, the Oirechtas produced a background document entitled ''Prostitution regulation in Ireland: which way now?''&lt;ref name=whichway/&gt; This was followed by a conference in Dublin organised by the Department, to discuss policy alternatives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ihra.net/contents/1275|title='Ireland considering the Swedish model against prostitution?  Maybe not after all' by Louise Persson|author=|date=29 October 2012|website=Harm Reduction International}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Following a request by the [[Minister for Justice and Equality]], the [[Oireachtas]] Justice Committee held hearings on discussion document between December 2012 and February 2013. Prior to the hearings, a number of the committee members, such as Independent [[Seanad Éireann|Senator]] [[Katherine Zappone]], had already committed to a sex purchase ban, and the majority of submissions and presentations supported this measure and were associated with Turn Off the Red Light.&lt;ref name=walsh/&gt; In June 2013, it produced a unanimous report

In August 2014, former US President [[Jimmy Carter]] wrote to all Irish politicians urging the adoption of the criminalisation of the purchase of sex. Carter had been briefed by the Immigrant Council of Ireland, a leading figure in the Turn Off the Red Light campaign.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.irishexaminer.com/ireland/jimmy-carter-calls-for-reform-of-irish-law-on-prostitution-284461.html Jimmy Carter calls for reform of Irish law on prostitution.

==Forms and extent of prostitution==
There are no up-to-date reliable figures estimating the number of women or men currently working in prostitution in Ireland, but one estimate is 1,000.&lt;ref name=whichway/&gt; During Ireland's economic boom male demand for female prostitution services increased.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}} There has been a marked increase in people turning towards the internet and sites as a more effective means of advertising.&lt;ref&gt;[http://tribune.maithu.com/archive/article/2009/jan/11/lucrative-escort-website-claims-new-owner-is-a-for/ "Lucrative 'escort' website claims new owner is a former Irish prostitute"], Ali Bracken, ''Irish Tribune'', 11 January 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

For many years prior to the 1993 Sexual Offences Act, most female prostitutes worked on the streets, but, since this time, brothels marketed as [[escort agencies]] have been the most prevalent form of prostitution. Advertising in print publications is illegal, but a very developed Internet advertising medium exists.

Prostitutes of many nationalities now reside in Ireland and ''Ruhama'', an organisation opposed to prostitution, reported to the government in 2006 claiming that over 200 women were [[Human trafficking|trafficked]] into Ireland.&lt;ref name=whichway/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ruhama.ie/easyedit/files/WebOireachtas%20Justice%20cmtee%20Presentation%20230506website.doc |title=Presentation to the Oireachtas Justice Committee |author=Kathleen Fahy |publisher=Ruhama |date=May 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120425071018/http://www.ruhama.ie/easyedit/files/WebOireachtas%20Justice%20cmtee%20Presentation%20230506website.doc |archivedate=25 April 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.escortsurveys.com/irish_escort_clients_survey_2006.html | title=Irish Escort Clients 2006 Survey |publisher=EscortSurveys.com |date=February 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Advocacy ==

=== Organisations ===
SWAI (Sex Workers Alliance Ireland), is an advocacy group for sex workers in Ireland, was formed in 2009 by an alliance of individuals and groups to promote the social inclusion, health, safety, civil rights, and the right to self-determination of sex workers. SWAI actively advocates for the decriminalisation of sex work in Ireland and believes sex workers in Ireland should be free to work in safety without fear, judgment or stigma.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sexworkersallianceireland.org/home Sex Workers Alliance Ireland] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111006184049/http://www.sexworkersallianceireland.org/home |date=6 October 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/ireland/2009/1120/1224259179202.html "Sex workers must not be viewed as victims, says group"], ''Irish Times'', 11 November 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

Ugly Mugs Ireland is a safety scheme for sex workers established in 2009.  It brings sex workers together to share information with each other about potential dangers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.uglymugs.ie|title=Ugly Mugs Ireland &amp; UK, safety for sex workers|author=|date=|website=Ugly Mugs Ireland|accessdate=12 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.independent.ie/irish-news/news/sex-workers-abused-by-men-posing-as-gardai-30804939.html "Sex workers abused by men posing as gardai"], ''Irish Independent'', 7 December 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

Ruhama ([[Hebrew]]: Renewed life), established in 1989, is a Dublin-based NGO operated by the Catholic [[Sisters of Our Lady of Charity]] order &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.urban75.net/forums/threads/trustees-of-irish-anti-prostitution-ngo-ruhama-used-to-run-magdelene-laundries.300985/|title=Trustees of Irish anti-prostitution NGO Ruhama used to run Magdelene Laundries|author=|date=|website=urban75.net}}&lt;/ref&gt; which works on a national level with women affected by prostitution and other forms of commercial sexual exploitation. The organisation regards prostitution as violence against women and violations of women's human rights. Ruhama sees prostitution and the social and cultural attitudes which sustain it as being deeply rooted in gender inequality and social marginalisation. Ruhama offers a range of services to support women in and exiting prostitution. Ruhama also seeks to highlight sex trafficking.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ruhama.ie/ Ruhama website], retrieved 3 September 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thejournal.ie/ruhama-reports-18-per-cent-increase-in-demand-for-support-services-567797-Aug2012/ "Ruhama reports 18 per cent increase in demand for support services"], ''The Journal.ie'', 22 August 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Campaigns ===
A campaign set up in 2011 to end prostitution and sex trafficking in Ireland called "Turn Off the Red Light" is run by an alliance of more than 66 community, union and religious groups,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.turnofftheredlight.ie/ Turn Off the Red Light], website&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rte.ie/news/2011/0202/prostitution.html "Group calls for reform of prostitution laws"], RTÉ News / Ireland, 2 February 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20110214042236/http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/ireland/2011/0203/1224288890630.html "Prominent Irishmen seek change to prostitution laws"], Connor Lally, ''Irish Times'', 3 February 2011&lt;/ref&gt; including the [[Irish Nurses and Midwives Organisation]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://southdublin.today.ie/2014/06/26/news-inmo-prostitution/ Irish Nurses and Midwives Organisation. Irish Nurses call for new prostitution laws in Ireland 2014] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140712115632/http://southdublin.today.ie/2014/06/26/news-inmo-prostitution/ |date=12 July 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.inmo.ie/Home/Index/7640/10204|title=Social Policy - Prostitution – target the real criminals|author=Clare Treacy|date=5 September 2014|website=archive.org|deadurl=|archiveurl=|archivedate=|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Irish Medical Organisation]]. Core members are the Immigrant Council, Ruhama and the [[National Women's Council of Ireland|National Women's Council]].

In response, a counter-campaign called "Turn Off the Blue Light" was created by sex workers and supporters in favour of decriminalisation to rebut what they see as misleading information and to present a positive image of sex workers in Ireland. A chief complaint it has of the "Turn Off The Red Light" campaign is that it conflates legal and consensual sex work with illegal human trafficking.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20110509035132/http://www.turnoffthebluelight.ie/ Turn Off the Blue Light], website&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.humanrights.ie/index.php/2011/05/01/international-workers-day-and-the-labour-rights-of-women/ "International Workers Day and the Labour Rights of Women"], Máiréad Enright, Human Rights in Ireland&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Repino''' ({{lang-ru|Ре́пино}}) is an [[administrative divisions of Saint Petersburg|area]] of [[Saint Petersburg]], [[Russia]], and a station of the [[Saint Petersburg-Vyborg railroad]]. It was known by its Finnish name '''Kuokkala''' until 1948, when it was renamed after its most famous inhabitant, the painter [[Ilya Repin]]. It is {{convert|30|km|sp=us}} northwest of St.&amp;nbsp;Petersburg&lt;ref name="Pb-Aktuell"&gt;[http://www.petersburg.aktuell.ru/petersburg/sehenswert/ausflug/repino_zu_gast_beim_grossen_meister_9.html {{de icon}} Petersburg-Aktuell, "Repino: Zu Gast beim großen Meister"], retrieved on 25 May 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; on the [[Karelian Isthmus]] and [[Gulf of Finland]]. The population was 2,478 at the 2010 Census.

==History==

The first mention of Kuokkala is in a peace treaty between the Republic of Novgorod and Sweden in 1323. The territory where the village is located was fought over between the Muscovites and Swedes in the 16th and 17th centuries and came under Russian control after the Great Northern War in early 18th Century. The village was inhabited by fishermen of Finnish and Russian ethnicities. The area developed further after 1870 when the [[Riihimäki–Saint Petersburg railway|railway linking St Petersburg and Helsinki]] passed through the town. Wealthier residents of St Peterburg built holiday villas in the area and a new railway station was built in 1889. Kuokkala was located in the [[Grand Duchy of Finland]], a self-governing part of the [[Russian Empire]], which had a more liberal environment, attracting artists and intellectuals including the artist [[Ilya Repin]]. [[Lenin]] spent some time in Kuokkala during 1905 to 1907, staying at the Vasa Villa.

Shortly after the [[October Revolution]] in 1917, [[Finland]] declared its independence from the [[Soviet Union]] and Kuokkala became part of the new independent nation while retaining a significant ethnic Russian population. There was a skirmish between White and Red Finns at Kuokkala during the [[Finnish Civil War]] on 28 April 1918. Kuokkala was taken over by the Soviets when the [[Karelian Isthmus]] was ceded by Finland to the [[Soviet Union]] after the [[Winter War]] and the [[Continuation War]] (1939–1944). Kuokkala became a part of the Leningrad Oblast in 1948 and was renamed Repino in memory of the [[Painting|painter]] [[Ilya Repin]].&lt;ref name="Pb-Aktuell"/&gt;. After the war, the area was developed as a tourist area with several hotels and sanatoriums and was transferred to the jurisdiction of the city of St Petersburg as part of the [[Kurortny District]]

==Penates==
[[File:Repino100.jpg|thumb|Ilya Repin's home called "Penates"]]

In 1899, Repin bought an estate here and called it ''Penaty'' ({{lang-ru|Пенаты}}, meaning [[Penates]], [[Roman Empire|Roman]] [[household deity|household deities]]). He designed his own house, and after it had been built several years later, Repin moved to Kuokkala. He would live there until his death in 1930. The house is surrounded by a large park.

The estate is part of the [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]] ''Saint Petersburg and Related Groups of Monuments''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/540/multiple=1&amp;unique_number=635 Unesco World Heritage Site ''Saint Petersburg and Related Groups of Monuments''], retrieved 25 May 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; The estate has been a museum since 1940.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.russianmuseums.info/M267 Info on the museum "Penates"], retrieved 25 May 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''[[Rusyns]]''' (''Rusíni'' in [[Rusyn language|Rusyn]], ''Ruteni'' in [[Romanian language|Romanian]]) are an [[Minorities of Romania|ethnic minority]] in [[Romania]].

While only 262 people officially identified themselves as "Rusyns" in the 2002 Romanian census, 3,890 people identified as '''[[Hutsuls]]''' ({{lang-ro|Huțuli}}; Rusyn ''Hutsuly'') – a minority whose members often identify or are regarded as a subgroup of the Rusyns.

Another 61,091 Romanian citizens identified as [[Ukrainians of Romania|Ukrainian]] ({{lang-ro|Ucraineni}}). As the archaic [[exonym]] [[Ruthenians]] was previously applied to both Rusyns and Ukrainians, some Ukrainian-Romanians may also regard themselves as Rusyns (without declaring themselves to, or being identified by, census collectors).{{Citation needed|date=June 2007}} Ukrainian-Romanians live primarily in northwestern Romania; the largest populations are found in [[Satu Mare County|Satu Mare]] and [[Maramureş County|Maramureş]] counties.

As an officially recognised ethnic minority, Rusyns have [[Romanian ethnic minorities parties|a reserved seat]] in the Romanian [[Chamber of Deputies of Romania|Chamber of Deputies]], which is currently held by a party called the [[Cultural Union of Ruthenians of Romania]].

'''''The Dancing Boys of Afghanistan''''' is a 2010 documentary film produced by Clover Films and directed by Afghan [[journalist]] [[Najibullah Quraishi]] about the practice of ''[[bacha bazi]]'' in [[Afghanistan]]. The 52-minute documentary premiered in the UK at the [[Royal Society of Arts]] on March 29, 2010&lt;ref name="arts"&gt;[http://www.thersa.org/events/audio-and-past-events/2010/true-stories-the-dancing-boys-of-afghanistan "True Stories: The Dancing Boys of Afghanistan"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100831101441/http://www.thersa.org/events/audio-and-past-events/2010/true-stories-the-dancing-boys-of-afghanistan |date=2010-08-31 }}, ''Royal Society of Arts'', screening 29 March 2010; 18:30&lt;/ref&gt; and aired on ''[[Frontline (U.S. TV series)|PBS Frontline]]'' in the United States on April 20.

''Bacha bazi'', also known as ''bacchá'' (from the [[Persian language|Persian]] ''bacheh'' بچه‌), literally "playing with boys" in Persian, [[Pashto language|Pashto]] and [[Hindi-Urdu]]), is a form of [[sexual slavery]] and [[child prostitution]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.digitaljournal.com/article/246409/Boys_in_Afghanistan_Sold_Into_Prostitution_Sexual_Slavery "Boys in Afghanistan Sold Into Prostitution, Sexual Slavery"], ''Digital Journal'', Nov 20, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; in which [[prepubescent]] and adolescent boys are sold to wealthy or powerful men for entertainment and sexual activities. This business thrives in [[Afghanistan]], where many men keep dancing boys as status symbols. The practice is illegal under Afghan law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/dancingboys/view/|title=The Dancing Boys of Afghanistan|website=PBS|date=April 20, 2010|accessdate=October 16, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2010-02-22/the-warlords-tune-afghanistans-war-on-children/338920|title=The Warlord's Tune: Afghanistan's war on children|last1=Bannerman|first1=Mark|website=Australian Broadcasting Corporation|accessdate=October 16, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The status of '''women in Bangladesh''' has been subject to many important changes over the past few centuries. The [[Bangladeshi]] women have made significant progress since the country gained its independence in 1971. The past four decades have seen increased political empowerment for women, better job prospects, increased opportunities of education and the adoption of new laws to protect their rights though Bangladesh's policies regarding women's rights is influenced by [[patriarchy|patriarchal values]].&lt;ref name="Patriarchy in Bangladesh"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.dhakatribune.com/bangladesh/law-rights/2017/05/21/patriarchy-kamla-bahsin-obr|title=Patriarchy: The deep rooted cultural beliefs that normalise rape|website=[[Dhaka Tribune]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{As of|2018}}, the [[Prime Minister of Bangladesh]], the [[Speaker of Jatiyo Shangshad|Speaker of Parliament]], the [[Leader of the Opposition (Bangladesh)|Leader of the Opposition]] were women. Bangladesh has also not elected a male as Prime Minister [[Bangladeshi general election, 1988|since 1988]].

==History==
{{Expert needed|Bangladesh|section|reason=rewrite and update needed on Pre- and post independence era|date= September 2018}}
Available data on health, nutrition, education, and economic performance indicated that in the 1980s the status of '''women in [[Bangladesh]]''' remained considerably inferior to that of men. Women, in custom and practice, remained subordinate to men in almost all aspects of their lives; greater autonomy was the privilege of the rich or the necessity of the very poor.

Most women's lives remained centred on their traditional roles, and they had limited access to [[market (place)|market]]s, [[productive services]], education, health care, and local government. This lack of opportunities contributed to high fertility patterns, which diminished family well-being, contributed to the malnourishment and generally poor health of children, and frustrated educational and other national development goals. In fact, acute poverty at the margin appeared to be hitting hardest at women. As long as women's access to health care, education, and training remained limited, prospects for improved productivity among the female population remained poor.

About 82 percent of women lived in rural areas in the late 1980s. The majority of rural women, perhaps 70 percent, were in small cultivator, tenant, and landless households; many worked as labourers part-time or seasonally, usually in post-harvest activities, and received payment in kind or in meager cash wages. Another 20 percent, mostly in poor landless households, depended on casual labour, gleaning, begging, and other irregular sources of income; typically, their income was essential to household survival. The remaining 10 percent of women were in households mainly in the professional, trading, or large-scale landowning categories, and they usually did not work outside the home.

The economic contribution of women was substantial but largely unacknowledged. Women in rural areas were responsible for most of the post-harvest work, which was done in the [[Kitchen|chula]], and for keeping livestock, poultry, and small gardens. Women in cities relied on domestic and traditional jobs, but in the 1980s they increasingly worked in manufacturing jobs, especially in the readymade garment industry. Those with more education worked in government, health care, and teaching, but their numbers remained very small. Continuing high rates of population growth and the declining availability of work based in the chula meant that more women sought employment outside the home. Accordingly, the female labour force participation rate doubled between 1974 and 1984, when it reached nearly 8 percent. Female wage rates in the 1980s were low, typically ranging between 20 and 30 percent of male wage rates.

The official religion of Bangladesh is Islam with over 90% of the population being Muslim.&lt;ref name=census2011&gt;{{cite web|url=http://203.112.218.65/WebTestApplication/userfiles/Image/National%20Reports/Union%20Statistics.pdf |title= Official Census Results 2011 page xiii

==Education and economic development==

===Education===
{{Further information|Education in Bangladesh}}
[[File:Azimpur Girls' School 1.JPG|thumb|200 px|Azimpur Girls' School in Bangladesh]]
The [[literacy rate]] in Bangladesh is lower for females (55.1%) compared to males (62.5%) – 2012 estimates for population aged 15 and over.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/Library/publications/the-world-factbook/fields/2103.html|title=The World Factbook|website=www.cia.gov|access-date=2 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the past decades, Bangladesh has improved its education policies; and the access of girls to education has increased. In the 1990s, girls' enrolment in primary school has increased rapidly. Although there is now gender parity in enrolments at the primary and lower secondary school level, the percentage of girls drops in the later secondary school years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.unicef.org/bangladesh/education.html|title=UNICEF Bangladesh – Girls' Education – Girls' Education Strategy for Bangladesh|website=www.unicef.org|access-date=2 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Workforce participation===
Women in Bangladesh are engaged in many work activities, from domestic work inside the home, to outside paid work. Women's work is often undervalued and under-reported.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lse.ac.uk/genderInstitute/about/resourcesNailaKabeer/mahmudAndTasneemTheUnderreportingOfWomensEconomicActivity.pdf|title=Department of Gender Studies|first=London School of Economics and Political|last=Science|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Land and property rights===
Women's [[inheritance]] rights are poor: discriminatory laws and patriarchal social norms make it difficult for many women to have access to land.&lt;ref name="ohchr.org"&gt;http://www.ohchr.org/Documents/HRBodies/CEDAW/RuralWomen/CDABangladesh.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Most women inherit according to the local interpretations of [[Sharia Law]].&lt;ref name="ohchr.org"/&gt;

==Crimes against women==

===Rape===
{{see also|Chittagong Hill Tracts conflict|Persecution of Buddhists}}

Bengali settlers and soldiers in the [[Chittagong Hill Tracts]] have raped native [[Jumma people|Jumma]] ([[Chakma people|Chakma]]) women "with impunity" with the Bangladeshi security forces doing little to protect the Jummas and instead assisting the rapists and settlers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.survivalinternational.org/news/10141 |title=Chittagong Hill Tracts of Bangladesh – rapists act with impunity |last1=McEvoy  |first1=Mark |last2= |first2= |date= 3 April 2014 |website=Survival International – The movement for tribal peoples |publisher= |access-date= |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The indigenous Buddhist and Hindu Jummas of Sino-Tibetan background have been targeted by the Bangladeshi government with massive amounts of violence and genocidal policies as ethnic Bengali settlers swarmed into Jumma lands, seized control and massacred them with the Bangladeshi military engaging in mass rape of women, massacres of entire villages and attacks on Hindu and Buddhist religious sites with deliberate targeting of monks and nuns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.marxist.com/fate-chittagong-hill-tracts-tribes-bangladesh.htm |title=The fate of the Chittagong Hill Tracts tribes of Bangladesh  |last1=Iqbal   |first1=Jamil M. |last2= |first2= |date= 2 November 2009  |website= In Defence of Marxism |publisher= |access-date= |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Bangladesh's rural areas rape has been committed by 1/8th of the men.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.vice.com/video/bangladeshi-gang-rape |title=Bangladeshi Gang Rape |last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |date=21 November 2014 |website=Vice News |publisher= |access-date= |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Child marriage===
Bangladesh has one of the highest rates of [[child marriage]] in the world.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.unicef.org/sowc09/docs/SOWC09-CountryExample-Mali.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The practice of [[dowry]], although illegal, contributes to this phenomenon.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.unicef.org/bangladesh/children_4866.htm |title=Early marriage |publisher=UNICEF |accessdate=27 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; 29% of girls get married before age 15 and 65% before the age of 18.&lt;ref name=HRW/&gt; Government action has had little effect, and has been contradictory: although the government has pledged to end child marriage by 2041, the Prime Minister in 2015 attempted to lower the age of marriage for girls from 18 to 16.&lt;ref name=HRW&gt;{{citation |url=https://www.hrw.org/news/2015/06/09/bangladesh-girls-damaged-child-marriage |title=Bangladesh: Girls Damaged by Child Marriage: Stop Plan to Lower Marriage Age to 16 |publisher=Human Rights Watch |date=9 June 2015 |accessdate=27 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; An exception to the law was instituted so that marriage at 16 is permitted with parental consent.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://en.prothom-alo.com/bangladesh/news/60481/Age-of-marriage-18-but-16-with-parental-consent |title=Age of marriage 18, but 16 with parental consent |publisher=Prothom Alo |author=Mansura Hossain |date=7 March 2015 |accessdate=27 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Domestic violence===
In 2010, Bangladesh enacted the ''Domestic Violence (Prevention and Protection) Act, 2010''.&lt;ref&gt;http://phrplanbd.org/attachments/article/42/DV%20Act_Engling%20Translation%20%28unofficial%29.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Domestic violence (DV) is accepted by a significant percentage of the population: in the 2011 [[Demographic and Health Surveys|DHS survey]], 32.5% of women said that a husband is justified in hitting or beating his wife for specific reasons (the most common reason given was if the wife "argues with him" – at 22.4%).&lt;ref&gt;http://dhsprogram.com/pubs/pdf/FR265/FR265.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; In recent years violence towards women, committed by men, has decreased significantly and is considerably low compared to south Asian countries like Sri Lanka, Nepal, and India.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/57-of-boys-53-of-girls-think-wife-beating-is-justified/articleshow/12862006.cms|title=57% of boys, 53% of girls think wife beating is justified – Times of India|access-date=2 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Violence towards women is a crime. Awareness needs to be raised to uphold women's human rights.

===Dowry===
Dowry violence is a problem in Bangladesh. The country has taken action against the practice of dowry through laws such as ''Dowry Prohibition Act, 1980''; ''Dowry Prohibition (Amendment) Ordinance, 1982''; and ''Dowry Prohibition (Amendment) Ordinance, 1986''. However, abuses regarding dowry continue, with the legal enforcement against dowry being weak.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irinnews.org/report/86100/bangladesh-dowry-violence-continues-unabated|title=Dowry violence continues unabated|date=11 September 2009|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sexual harassment===
{{Further information|Sexual harassment|Eve teasing}}
''Eve-teasing'' is a [[euphemism]] used throughout South Asia, in countries such as Pakistan,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url= http://tribune.com.pk/story/572526/eve-teasing-the-power-game/ |title= Eve teasing: The power game| work= The Express Tribune |location= Pakistan | first= Tehniya S |last= Afridi |date= 8 July 2013 |accessdate= 9 February 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; India and Bangladesh,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thedailystar.net/eve-teasers-beat-dead-youth-in-dhaka-45137 "Eve-teasers beat dead youth in Dhaka"], ''[[The Daily Star (Bangladesh)|Daily Star]]'', 11 October 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; for public [[sexual harassment]] or [[Sexual assault|molestation]] (often known as "[[street harassment]]") of women by men, where [[Eve]] alludes to the very first woman, according to the Biblical [[creation story]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation| url= https://books.google.com/books?id=Fn-Sh1nv7pQC&amp;pg=PA109&amp;dq=eve-teasing |title= Eve Teasing |work= The Official Dictionary of Unofficial English |first= Grant |last= Barrett |publisher= McGraw-Hill Professional |year= 2006 |isbn= 0-07-145804-2 |page= 109}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sexual harassment affects many women in Bangladesh, especially teenage girls, where the girls are intimidated in the streets, are shouted obscenities at, laughed at, or grabbed by their clothes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.irinnews.org/report/91356/bangladesh-when-sexual-harassment-leads-to-suicide|title=When sexual harassment leads to suicide|date=13 December 2010|access-date=2 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.dhakatribune.com/bangladesh/law-rights/2018/03/08/sexual-harassment-solution-gender-literacy-mindset|title=Sexual harassment: Solution lies with gender literacy, changing patriarchal mindset|website=[[Dhaka Tribune]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; As Bangladeshi society is conservative, girls and women show negative attitudes towards sexuality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.dhakatribune.com/uncategorized/2014/05/05/are-we-ready-for-sex-ed|title=Are we ready for sex ed?|website=[[Dhaka Tribune]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other concerns==
===Freedom of movement===
Bangladeshi women and girls don't get the rights of [[freedom of movement]] everywhere as the men have, the society is based on patriarchal values and [[social conservatism|socially conservative]] policies towards women and girl's freedom.&lt;ref name="Patriarchy in Bangladesh"/&gt;

===Health===
The [[maternal mortality rate]] in Bangladesh is 240 deaths/100,000 live births (as of 2010).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/rankorder/2223rank.html|title=The World Factbook|website=www.cia.gov|access-date=2 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sexually transmitted infections]] are relatively common,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmc = 1744386 | pmid=11588280 | volume=77 | title=Prevalence of infectious diseases in Bangladeshi women living adjacent to a truck stand: HIV/STD/hepatitis/genital tract infections | year=2001 | journal=Sex Transm Infect | pages=344–50 | last1 = Gibney | first1 = L | last2 = Macaluso | first2 = M | last3 = Kirk | first3 = K | last4 = Hassan | first4 = MS | last5 = Schwebke | first5 = J | last6 = Vermund | first6 = SH | last7 = Choudhury | first7 = P | doi=10.1136/sti.77.5.344}}&lt;/ref&gt; although the rate of [[HIV/AIDS]] is low.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/rankorder/2155rank.html|title=The World Factbook|website=www.cia.gov|access-date=2 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2014 study found that Bangladeshi women' knowledge about different diseases is very poor.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.biomedcentral.com/content/pdf/1471-2458-14-775.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Bangladesh has recently expanded training programs of midwives to improve reproductive health and outcomes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/features/2014/midwifes-bangladesh/en/|title=WHO - Bangladesh expands training of midwives to improve maternal and neonatal health|website=www.who.int}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Family planning===
Already in the 1990s, [[family planning]] was recognised as very important in Bangladesh.&lt;ref&gt;http://dspace.icddrb.org/dspace/bitstream/123456789/2561/1/Bangladesh+family+planning+programme,lesson+learned+and+direction+for+the+future,+monograph+6.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;
The [[total fertility rate]] (TFR) is 2.45 children born/woman (estimates as of 2014).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/rankorder/2127rank.html|title=The World Factbook|website=www.cia.gov|access-date=2 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Women in society sidebar}}
'''Women in Brunei''' are women living in [[Brunei Darussalam]]. In their version of Islamic society, Bruneian women are regarded as persons of "very high status".&lt;ref name="EC"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.everyculture.com/Bo-Co/Brunei-Darussalam.html#b#ixzz2VlCLVy2y|title=Culture of Brunei Darussalam - history, people, traditions, women, beliefs, food, customs, family, social|website=www.everyculture.com|access-date=2017-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The U.S. Department of State has stated that discrimination against women is a problem in Brunei.&lt;ref name="state.gov"&gt;[https://www.state.gov/j/drl/rls/hrrpt/2010/eap/154379.htm 2010 Human Rights Report: Brunei Darussalam]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal rights==
{{Citation needed span|text=The law prohibits sexual harassment and stipulates that whoever assaults or uses criminal force, intending thereby to outrage or knowing it is likely to outrage the modesty of a person, shall be punished with imprisonment for as much as five years and [[Caning in Brunei|caning]]. The law stipulates imprisonment of up to 30 years, and caning with not fewer than 12 strokes for rape. The law does not criminalise spousal rape; it explicitly states that sexual intercourse by a man with his wife, as long as she is not under 13 years of age, is not rape. Protections against sexual assault by a spouse are provided under the amended Islamic Family Law Order 2010 and Married Women Act Order 2010. The penalty for breaching a protection order is a fine not exceeding BN$2,000 ($1,538) or imprisonment not exceeding six months.

There is no specific domestic violence law, but arrests have been made in domestic violence cases under the Women and Girls Protection Act. The police investigate domestic violence only in response to a report by a victim. The police were generally responsive in the investigation of such cases. The criminal penalty for a minor domestic assault is one to two weeks in jail and a fine. An assault resulting in serious injury is punishable by caning and a longer prison sentence.

A special unit staffed by female officers has been established within the police department to investigate domestic abuse and child abuse complaints. A hotline was available for persons to report domestic violence. The Ministry of Culture, Youth, and Sport's Department of Community Development provides counselling for women and their spouses. Based on individual circumstances, some female and minor victims were placed in protective custody while waiting for their cases to be brought to court. Islamic courts staffed by male and female officials offered counselling to married couples in domestic violence cases. Officials did not encourage wives to reconcile with flagrantly abusive spouses. Islamic courts recognise assault as grounds for divorce.

Couples and individuals have the right to decide the number, spacing, and timing of their children, and have access to contraceptive devices and methods through the government and private clinics. According to information gathered by the UN, in 2008 the maternal mortality rate was an estimated 21 deaths per 100,000 live births. Citizens enjoy free medical and health care, including skilled attendance during childbirth, prenatal care, and essential obstetric and postpartum care. Women had equal access to diagnostic and treatment facilities for [[sexually transmitted diseases]]. Women had equal access to [[HIV]] treatment and counselling, as well as follow-up treatment.

In accordance with the government's interpretation of Qur'anic precepts, Muslim women have rights similar to those of Muslim men in areas such as divorce and child custody. Islamic law requires that males receive twice the inheritance of women. Civil law permits female citizens to pass their nationality on to their children and to own property and other assets, including business properties. Women with permanent positions in the government can now apply for travel allowances for their children. They cannot do so for husbands working in the private sector. With this exception, they receive the same allowance privileges as their college-educated male counterparts. According to government statistics, women made up 57 percent of the civil service force and held 28 percent of senior management posts. Women are not discriminated against in access to employment and business.|date=June 2017|reason=}}

=== Reproductive rights ===
{{Main|Abortion in Brunei}}
[[Abortion]] in Brunei is largely illegal, with an exception if a woman's life is danger. Previously, the penalty for receiving an abortion was up to seven years in prison, with 10-15 years for the person performing the abortion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/population/abortion/Brunei.abo.htm|title=Brunei abortion penal code|last=|first=|date=|website=www.hsph.harvard.edu|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=UN&gt;{{cite book | title=Abortion Policies: A Global Review | url=https://www.un.org/esa/population/publications/abortion/ | chapter=Brunei Darussalam | chapterurl=https://www.un.org/esa/population/publications/abortion/doc/brunei1.doc | deadurl=no | year=2002 | publisher=United Nations Population Division | volume=Country Profiles | format=DOC | accessdate=14 March 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, Brunei's government implemented [[Sharia]] criminal law in a series of phases which was set to increase the punishment for abortion to execution by [[stoning]].&lt;ref name="beverly hills"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Cohen|first1=Sandy|title=Beverly Hills Hotel Boycotted Over Brunei's Sharia Penal Code|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/05/06/beverly-hills-hotel-boycott-brunei_n_5271996.html|accessdate=1 December 2014|work=Huffington Post|publisher=The Huffington Post|date=6 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; This part of the law was to come into effect in 2016,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://thediplomat.com/2015/05/the-implications-of-bruneis-sharia-law/|title=The Implications of Brunei’s Sharia Law|last=Ozanick|first=Bill|work=The Diplomat|date=May 21, 2015|access-date=2017-06-25|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; although it's now expected to come into effect in 2018. In 2016, a 22 year old women was sentenced to seven years in prison for obtaining an abortion using the [[Medical abortion|abortion pill]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.brudirect.com/news.php?id=14492|title=Youth in Abortion Case Set for Time in Jail, fine|last=|first=|date=|website=www.brudirect.com|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Clothing norms ==
The Muslim women of Brunei wear traditional head cover known as the ''[[tudong]]'',&lt;ref name=EC/&gt; also spelled as ''tudung''.

== Gender roles ==
In recent years, Bruneian women have started to assume "positions of responsibility" in the [[Government of Brunei]]. They are able to take jobs in the [[armed forces of Brunei]]; however they are not allowed to serve while in combat situations.&lt;ref name=EC/&gt;

{{Women in society sidebar}}
'''Women in South Korea''' have experienced significant improvements for social changes in recent years, compared to previous times,  when [[Korean Confucianism|Confucianism]] was deeply imbued in the culture. &lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=South Korea Women in Culture, Business &amp; Travel : A Profile of Korean Women in the Fabric of Society|last=|first=|publisher=World Trade Press|year=2010|isbn=1-60780-256-2|location=|pages=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; In today's society, the economy of South Korea has tremendously improved due to urbanisation, industrialisation, military authoritarianism, democratic reform, and social liberalisation since the late 1960s. Thus, gender roles and gender identities eventually have been modified as a result to changing modernity. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Under Construction : The Gendering of Modernity, Class, and Consumption in the Republic of Korea|last=Kendall|first=Laurel|publisher=Honolulu : University of Hawaii Press. 2002|year=2002|isbn=9780824824884|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; More than the half of Korean women are employed and furthermore, more than 25% of married women are employed as full-time workers. In politics, although there are not as many female politicians as male politicians, the female politicians have recently begun to participate more actively than in the past. For instance, in National Assembly, women occupy 20 of the 299 seats. The Prime Minister and leaders of parties are all females.

The status of women vary depending on their social class and financial independence. In metropolitan areas, women have more access to education, which means they are less confined to the home as housewives. Most of the employed women in urban areas work in tertiary industries such as the service sector. Therefore, as working-class women, they have more power in making decisions within their households and are more financially independent. On the other hand, in rural areas, most of women work in primary industry such as the agriculture sector. In fact, they do not have the variety of educational and employment opportunities.

The status of women has elevated to the point where it could be seen as equal to men's social standing  in terms of education, health, and legal rights. However, there are still plenty of political and economical [[Gender inequality in South Korea|prejudices]] against women. &lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Women's Experiences and Feminist Practices in South Korea|last=Chang|first=Pil-wha|last2=Kim|first2=Eun-Shil|publisher=Ewha Womans University Press|year=2005|isbn=89-7300-638-X|location=South Korea|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, Korean women are still consistently facing gender stereotypes regarding rigid [[Gender role|gender roles]]. These stereotypes include women staying at home as housewives, being subordinate to men, having less power and voice in political and economic participation and movements, and many more. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cooke|first=Fang Lee|date=2010|title=Women's participation in employment in Asia: a comparative analysis of China, India, Japan and South Korea|url=https://doi.org/10.1080/09585192.2010.509627|journal=The International Journal of Human Resource Management|volume=Volume 21|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Women in South Korea are not restricted to dressing in a certain way, they follow a Western style of dress.

== History ==
{{Main articles|comfort women}}
In traditional Korean society, women were taught to be subordinated without formal advanced education or little education. Their roles were limited to be confined to the home as housewives and good mothers. &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Their duties were to maintain harmony in the household by avoiding any unnecessary conflicts. In addition, a married couple were to live in her husband's household by taking care of her husband's whole family including parents-in law. Women were expected to produce sons and they were blamed if children were girls due to a notion of preferring a son to a daughter. Women did not have the voice nor participate in society as men did, instead they were expected to support their husbands. &lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://asiasociety.org/education/womens-role-contemporary-korea|title=Women's Role in Contemporary Korea|date=2016|website=Asia Society|publisher=Korean Overseas Information Service (KOIS)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The improvement of women status was first found during the late 19th century to the early 20th century. A large number of Western Christian missionaries came to South Korea in order to institute modern schools. Among these modern schools, some of them established the schools with a goal to educate women in different fields including literatures, arts, religious works and many more. In fact, before the teachings of Western Christian missionaries, most of the women did not have any access to education. As a result, women were able to participate in political movement because women who got the education also engaged in enlightening other women.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; During the era under the colonial administration of imperial Japan, Korea women (almost Up to 200,000) were sent to work as [[comfort women]] in Japan's military brothels. Until the end of [[World War II]], Korea was under [[Korea under Japanese rule|Japanese occupation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.cnn.com/2014/06/13/world/asia/china-japan-nanjing-massacre-unesco/index.html|title = UNESCO lists Nanjing Massacre and 'comfort women,' China says|date = 17 June 2014|accessdate = 24 April 2015|website = CNN U.S. Edition|publisher = Cable News Network, Turner Broadcasting System, Inc.|last = Li|first = Zoe}}&lt;/ref&gt; Women participated in the independence movement against the Japanese occupation during Japanese colony during 1910-1945, therefore, the role of women has shifted slightly by having education and participating in political movements. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Comfort Women: Sexual Violence and Postcolonial Memory in Korea and Japan|last=Soh|first=Sarah|publisher=|year=2008|isbn=9780226767765|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After becoming independent from Japan, the Republic of Korea was established as a liberal democracy. Women who pursued education, work, and public life could now achieve constitutional rights for equal opportunities. For example, several schools were founded for the education of women. Women educated from these schools began to engage in the arts, teaching, economic activities, and engaging other women in discussion of gender equality.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.worldpolicy.org/blog/2013/12/23/why-korean-women-opt-out|title = Why Korean Women Opt Out|date = 23 December 2013|accessdate = 24 April 2015|website = World Policy Journal Blog|publisher = World Policy Institute|last = Chun|first = Ye Eun}}&lt;/ref&gt; The percentage of women has steadily increased in professional fields which has resulted in significant contributions to society, especially in terms of increasing GDP. As they took a larger role in economic activities, the educational level of women also increased, providing additional opportunities for professionalization. Today, Korean women receive high levels of education and actively participate in a wide variety of fields, including education, medicine, engineering, scholarship, the arts, law, literature, and sports.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://jia.sipa.columbia.edu/online-articles/empowerment-women-south-korea/#_ednref7|title = The Empowerment of Women in South Korea|date = 10 March 2014|accessdate = 24 April 2015|website = Journal of International Affairs|publisher = Columbia University SIPA|last = Resos|first = Archie}}&lt;/ref&gt; Women's participation in social and economic culture is expected to continue to grow and diversify after the election of South Korea's first female president, [[Park Geun-hye|Park Geun-Hye]]. This is partially due to Park Geun-Hye's promise to promote a “women’s revolution” and provide support for child care, increased opportunities for promotion, and salary equality. Furthermore, Park Geun-Hye also promised to make other advances for women, including: increase the representation of women, to facilitate women’s employment and provide support for female workers, to increase educational opportunities for women to be competitive in the labor market, to provide social welfare policies for women, to promote women’s involvement in various social activities. However, not all of these policies have manifested.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.economist.com/news/special-report/21588207-faced-overwhelming-pressures-south-korean-women-have-gone-baby-strike-pram-too|title = A Pram Too Far: Women in South Korea|date = 26 October 2013|accessdate = 24 April 2015|website = The Economist|publisher = The Economist Newspaper Limited|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Legal Rights ==
{{Main articles|Law of South Korea}}
Nowadays, women in South Korea are guaranteed for all the legal rights that men have. In 1948, women gained their legal rights to vote, drive, and own and inherit properties and assets. &lt;ref name=":2"/&gt; For instance, Korean females have access to all medical and healthcare services. Every Korean citizens are guaranteed for national health insurance under the National Health Insurance Act.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; South Korea has worked on its way to implement gender equality by revising and changing any discriminative contents in its existing legislative laws since the 1980s. In fact, South Korea's constitution has achieved its goal of ensuring diverse gender equality legislation within a short period of time. &lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

Implementation of laws to prohibit [[Gender inequality in South Korea|gender inequalities and prejudice]] have increased  the number of women in workforce. &lt;ref name=":2"/&gt; Nevertheless, the women status in South Korea illustrates the fact that Korea still has a lot of room to be improved for gender equality. Therefore, the legislations and public rules are critical and significant roles to influence Korean cities to elevate the social structure substantially. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kim|first=Sun Uk|date=2016|title=Gender Equality Legislation in Korea|url=https://doi.org/10.1080/12259276.2007.11666031|journal=Asian Journal of Women's Studies|volume=13|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Education ==
{{main article|Education in South Korea|Ewha Womans University}}
As it was shown above, in traditional Korean society, females could not have access to formal education that the literacy rate was even low. The transition came in the late 19th century to the early 20th century when the Western Christian missionaries came to South Korea by establishing modern schools for girls. In 1886, Methodist missionaries found a primary school. In 1945, this primary school gained its status as an university, which is now called [[Ewha Womans University]]. Ewha Womans University is still known as the most prestigious women's university in South Korea.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://countrystudies.us/south-korea/40.htm|title=South Korea - Changing Role of Women|website=countrystudies.us|access-date=2018-03-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; There were numerous women's schools established respectively.  In the 1890s, Chongsin Girls' School and Paehwa Girls' School were established in [[Seoul]], which is the capital city of Korea. There were about ten women institutions of higher education such as junior colleges, colleges, and university by 1987 in South Korea. In fact, the women enrolment for higher education was at 28%. In 1987, there were about 262,500 female students in higher education. Although more females had access to higher education compared to the past, there were only 16% of university and college women teachers in 1987. &lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

The growing number of women receiving a college education has meant that their sex role differs from that of their mothers and grandmothers. Many college-educated women plan independent careers and challenge the right of parents to choose a marriage partner. The often fierce battles between university students and police during the late 1980s included female participants. A correspondent for the Far Eastern Economic Review quoted a male student leader as saying that "short girls make great demonstrators, as they're very tough and very hard to catch." Whether politically active South Korean university women will follow their [[women in Japan|Japanese counterparts]], who demonstrated during the 1960s and 1970s, into a world of child-raising and placid [[consumerism]] remains to be seen. The number of employed married women, however, increased by approximately 12.6 percent annually in the years since 1977.

In 1983 more women—51.8%—were employed in rural areas than in urban areas—37.9 percent. Most of the women working in rural areas were over the age of thirty, as young females (and males) tended to move to, and seek employment in, [[cities in South Korea|cities]] and industrial areas.

Official South Korean statistics indicated that 43.6% of women were in the work force by 1988.{{citation needed|date=March 2011}} Prospects for lower class women, however, were frequently grim. In some cases, they were obliged to become part of the "entertainment industry" in order to survive economically. According to one estimate, [[brothel]]s, bars, [[massage parlor]]s, discos, and what are known as "Taiwan style" barbershops (that is, those often employing a greater number of masseuses than barbers) employed as many as 1 million women, though not all were prostitutes. This underworld of abuse and exploitation had begun to be criticized and exposed by women's activists.

In today's society, the Constitution ensures the equal access to education for women and also eliminate any discrimination of receiving education based on gender. South Korea. In 1970, the literacy rate was 87.6%. In addition, according to 2002 estimates, the literacy rate increased up to 97.9%; 96.6% of females and 99.2% of males are literate. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.indexmundi.com/south_korea/literacy.html|title=South Korea Literacy - Demographics|website=www.indexmundi.com|access-date=2018-03-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to 2008 estimates, there is approximately a 99% enrolment rate for both elementary school and middle school. The enrolment rate for high school is at approximately 96.6%. This means that almost 99% of the current South Korean females have approach to primary and secondary education. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://sites.miis.edu/southkoreaeducation/diversity-and-access/|title=Education in South Korea   » Diversity and Access to Education|website=sites.miis.edu|language=en-US|access-date=2018-03-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

== Family life ==
During the [[Goryeo Dynasty|Goryeo]] and early [[Joseon Dynasty]], it was customary for [[marriage in South Korea|married]] couples to live in the wife's parents' household. This arrangement suggests that the status of women was higher than it was during the later period of the Joseon Dynasty. [[Neo-Confucian]] [[orthodoxy]] dictated that the woman, separated from her parents, had a primary duty of providing a male [[heir]] for her husband's family. According to this custom, once married, a woman had to leave her parents' household and then become a part of her husband's household. The relationship between wife and husband was often, if not usually, distant, aptly described by the [[Korean language|Korean]] proverb: "By day, like seeing a stranger; by night, like seeing a lover." Joseon Dynasty law prohibited widows from remarrying, though a similar prohibition was not extended to widowers. Further, the sons and grandsons of widows who defied the ban, like children of secondary wives, were not allowed to take the [[civil service]] examinations and become scholar-officials.

The duty of a woman to her husband, or rather to her husband's family, was absolute and unquestionable. In the traditional society, only men could obtain a [[divorce]]. A husband could divorce his spouse if she were barren—barrenness being defined simply as the inability to bear sons. Even if a husband did not divorce his wife, he had the right to take a second wife, although the preferred solution for a man without a son during the Joseon Dynasty was to adopt a son of one of his brothers, if available. The incompatibility of a wife and her in-laws was another reason for divorce.

In contemporary society, both men and women have the right to obtain a divorce. Social and economic discrimination, however, make the lot of divorced women more difficult. The husband may still demand custody of the children, although a revision of the Family Law in 1977 made it more difficult for him to coerce or to deceive his wife into agreeing to an unfair settlement. The rate of divorce in South Korea is increasing rapidly. In 1975 the number of divorces was 17,000. In the mid-1980s, the annual number of divorces was between 23,000 and 26,000, and in 1987 there were 45,000 divorces.

The tradition of total female submission persisted in Korean villages until relatively recent times. One Korean scholar who came from the conservative [[Chungcheong]] region recalled that when a high school friend died of sickness during the 1940s, his young bride committed [[suicide in South Korea|suicide]]. Her act was commemorated in her own and the surrounding communities as an outstanding example of devotion to duty.

Traditionally, men and women were strictly segregated, both inside and outside the house. [[Yangban]] women spent most of their lives in seclusion in the women's chamber. It is said that the traditional pastime of [[nolttwigi]], a game of jumping up and down on a [[seesaw]]-like contraption, originated among bored women who wanted to peek over the high walls of their family compounds to see what the outside world was like. Economic necessity gave women of the lower classes some freedom as they participated in farm work and sometimes earned supplemental income through making and selling things.

As of February 2015, [[adultery]] is no longer illegal in South Korea.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;Greg Botelho and K.J. Kwon, [http://www.cnn.com/2015/02/26/asia/south-korea-adultery/ Court rules: Adultery no longer a crime in South Korea] February 26, 2015 [[CNN.com]]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Professional life ==
According to ''[[The Economist]]'''s 2013 "Glass-ceiling index" of five indicators of friendliness towards working women, South Korea ranks the lowest of all [[OECD]] countries because of its lack of women in senior jobs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|magazine=The Economist|title=The glass-ceiling index|url=https://www.economist.com/blogs/graphicdetail/2013/03/daily-chart-3|date=2013-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Historically, however, a small minority of women played an active role in society and even wielded political influence. These people included female shamans ([[mudang]]), who were called upon to cure illnesses, tell fortunes, or in other ways enlist the help of spirits in realizing the wishes of their clients. Despite its sponsorship of [[neo-Confucianism]], the [[Choson Dynasty]] had an office of shamanism, and female shamans often were quite influential in the royal palace. The female physicians who treated female patients (because male physicians were forbidden to examine them) constituted another important group of women. Sometimes they acted as spies or policewomen because they could get into the female quarters of a house. Still another group of women were the [[kisaeng]]. Some kisaeng, or entertainers, were merely [[prostitution in South Korea|prostitutes]]; but others, were talented musicians, dancers, painters, and poets who interacted with their male patrons. The kisaeng tradition perpetuated one of the more dubious legacies of the Joseon past: an extreme double standard concerning the sexual behavior of married men and women that still persists. In the cities, however, many middle class women have begun to break with these traditions.

An interesting regional variation on traditional female roles continued in the late 1980s. In the coastal villages of [[Cheju Island]], women divers swam in search of seaweed, oysters, and other marine products and were economically self-sufficient. Often they provided the main economic support for the family while the husband did subsidiary work — took care of the children and did household chores — in sharp contrast to the Confucian norm. The number of women divers was dwindling, however, and men were increasingly performing jobs in service industries. [[Ancestor worship]] was rarely practiced while female-centered [[shamanist]]ic rites were widespread.

The factories of South Korea employ hundreds of thousands of young women on shop floors and assembly lines making, among other things, textiles and clothes, shoes, and electronic components. South Korea's economic success was bought in large measure with the sweat of these generally overworked and poorly paid female laborers. In the offices of banks and other service enterprises, young women working as clerks and secretaries are indispensable. Unlike their sisters on Cheju Island, however, the majority of these women work only until marriage.

There has been a tangible increase in the number of women joining the workforce. In 2014, the number of Korean women in the workforce was estimated to be 57%, whereas in 1995 the number 47.6%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thediplomat.com/2014/05/south-koreas-woeful-workplace-inequality/|title=South Korea’s Woeful Workplace Inequality|first=Michelle Kwon, The|last=Diplomat|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The statistical increase in the quantity of employed women has not correlated with the equality of wage, as the gender wage gap reported in 2013 was 36.3%, the worst of all OECD nations present in the data.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oecd.org/gender/data/genderwagegap.htm|title=Gender wage gap - OECD|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although increasing numbers of women work outside the home, the dominant conception, particularly for the college-educated middle class, is that the husband is the "outside person," the one whose employment provides the main source of economic support; the wife is the "inside person," whose chief responsibility is maintenance of the household. While it is viewed as a societal norm that women be able to contribute to the finance of the household, the majority of the onus is placed upon men,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.popline.org/node/200336|title=Lowest-low fertility in the Republic of Korea: Causes consequences and policy responses.|first=Eun|last=KS|date=31 December 1969|publisher=|volume=22|issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Women tend to leave the labor force when they get married. Many women manage the family finances, and a large number join ''kye'', informal private short-term credit associations that give them access to funds that might not be obtainable from a conventional bank. Probably the most important responsibility of married women is the management of their children's [[education in South Korea|education]].

Women also claim much of the responsibilities of being a caretaker, as half of the women that voluntarily leave their mid-career or senior level jobs do so due to family commitments&lt;ref name="mckinsey.com"&gt;http://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/McKinsey%20Offices/Japan/PDF/Women_Matter_An_Asian_perspective.ashx&lt;/ref&gt; The college educated women in Korea tend to invest more time and capital to raising their children than individuals without a degree.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S027753951400171X | doi=10.1016/j.wsif.2014.10.016 | volume=48 | title=Over-heated education and lower labor market participation of Korean females in other OECD countries | journal=Women's Studies International Forum | pages=1–8}}&lt;/ref&gt; but due to the declining population in Korea There has been a conscious effort to address these issues by the South Korean government, as "the government gives loans or subsidies to businesses to build child care facilities, and more than half of all businesses now provide these. It also pays subsidies to businesses that offer more than 30 days of child care leave a year, allow women to work less than full time, and re-employ women returning from maternity leave."&lt;ref name="mckinsey.com"/&gt;

Despite these efforts, the number of women who regularly use these support systems compose a minority of the women who find themselves in this position. A major factor that influences these decisions is the declining birth rate in Korea, as Korea's birthrate of 1.19 per family&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://learningenglish.voanews.com/content/the-end-of-south-korea/2436486.html|title=Low Birthrate Threatens South Korea's Survival|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; put a greater emphasis upon the quality of education and care upon the one, or two children that the family will take care of.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|jstor=1831106|title=Child Endowments and the Quantity and Quality of Children|first1=Gary S.|last1=Becker|first2=Nigel|last2=Tomes|date=1 January 1976|publisher=|journal=Journal of Political Economy|volume=84|issue=4|pages=S143–S162|doi=10.2307/1831106}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Glass Ceiling for women have been tested in contemporary times. In 2012, Samsung promoted three women into executive roles which was unusual for a company of its size.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newsweek.com/samsungs-female-executives-shatter-south-koreas-glass-ceiling-65613|title=Shattering South Korea’s Ceiling|author=|date=30 July 2012|website=newsweek.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Samsung has also stated that it aims to have at least 10% of its executive positions to be held by women.

In 2013 Kwon Seon-joo became South Korea's first female bank CEO, as the CEO of state-owned [[Industrial Bank of Korea]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=KSTDec 30, 2013 |url=https://blogs.wsj.com/korearealtime/2013/12/30/south-korea-banks-get-first-female-ceo/ |title=South Korea Banks Get First Female CEO - Korea Real Time - WSJ |publisher=Blogs.wsj.com |date=2013-12-30 |accessdate=2015-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Crime ==

[[Prostitution in South Korea]] is illegal, but according to one estimate, [[brothel]]s, bars, [[massage parlor]]s, discos, and what are known as "Taiwan style" barbershops (that is, those often employing a greater number of masseuses than barbers) employed as many as 1 million women, though not all were prostitutes.{{Citation needed|date=June 2016}} This underworld of abuse and exploitation has begun to be criticized and exposed by women's activists.

In 2003, after recovering from a financial meltdown, the unemployment rate for women were 12% in the 15-29 age group.

{{Women in society sidebar}}
Similarly to the majority of countries around the world, the traditional [[gender role]]s of '''women in Uganda''' are often considered subordinate to those of men.  However, women in 
[[Uganda]] have substantial economic and social responsibilities throughout Uganda's many traditional societies. Ugandan women come from a range of economic and educational backgrounds. Despite economic and social change throughout the country, [[domestic violence]] and [[sexual assault]] remain prevalent issues in Uganda. These issues plague women all around the world and do not discriminate on the basis of race or class. However, poverty is correlated with an influx of domestic violence. Government reports suggest rising levels of domestic violence toward women that are directly attributable to [[poverty]].&lt;ref name="January 2002"&gt;{{cite web|title=UGANDA PARTICIPATORY POVERTY ASSESSMENT PROCESS MUBENDE DISTRICT REPORT.|url=http://www.commonlii.org/ug/other/UGJLOS/report/R3/3.pdf|work=January 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Social dynamics ==
Today gender roles in Uganda are influenced by tradition as well as constantly changing social dynamics. Traditional roles of women in Uganda are similar to traditional roles of women around the world. These roles are largely domestic including housekeeping, child rearing, fetching water, cooking and tending to community needs.

In the 1980s, some women in rural areas of [[Buganda]] were expected to kneel when speaking to a man. At the same time, however, women shouldered the primary responsibilities for childcare and subsistence cultivation, and in the twentieth century, women had made substantial contributions to cash-crop agriculture.&lt;ref name=cs&gt;[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/ugtoc.html Uganda country study]. [[Library of Congress]] [[Federal Research Division]] (December 1990). ''This article incorporates text from this source, which is in the [[public domain]].&lt;/ref&gt;

While it has traditionally been the role of men to control familial financial matters however, women provide substantial economic contributions to their families and to the larger Ugandan economy. Many women report they continue to struggle to find employment opportunities.  Some women leave their communities to find greater employment opportunities. Traditional gender roles that have been largely revitalized by US evangelical influence, assert the role of women as based in domestic responsibilities. Therefore, female employment continues to be stigmatized within Ugandan culture. However, there have been greater initiatives to generate women's employment around the country.&lt;ref name="January 2002"/&gt;

In many respects, Ugandan women hold and have held rights that exceeded those of women in Western societies. Many Ugandans recognize women as important religious and community leaders. Women have held rights to own land, influence crucial political decisions made by men, and cultivate crops for their own profit. When [[cash-crop]] agriculture became lucrative, as in southeastern Uganda in the 1920s, men often claimed rights to land owned by their female relatives, and their claims were supported by local councils and protectorate courts.&lt;ref name=cs/&gt;

=== Polygamy ===
{{Further|Polygamy in Uganda}}

Polygynous marriage practices, which permit a man to marry more than one woman, have reinforced some aspects of male dominance. However, they also have given women an arena for cooperating to oppose male dominance.&lt;ref name=cs/&gt;

In Uganda, a man sometimes grants "male status" to his senior wife, allowing her to behave as an equal toward men and as a superior toward his other wives. In the twentieth century, polygynous marriages represented social bonds that were not legally recognized as marriage, leaving women without legal rights to inheritance or maintenance in the event of divorce or widowhood.&lt;ref name=cs/&gt;

== Gender equality ==
As with many other countries, Uganda faces multiple obstacles in its movement toward gender equality. After gender equality and women empowerment was listed as one of the [[Millennium Development Goals|UN Millennium Development Goals of 2000]], the Ugandan Justice, Law and Order Sector (JLOS) responded in their ''Gender and Access to Justice (2001)'' annual report addressing various obstacles in accessing justice.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.undp.org/content/undp/en/home/sdgoverview/mdg_goals.html|title=Millennium Development Goals|website=UNDP|language=en|access-date=2018-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, the JLOS reported that because of patriarchy and the lack of gender equality, the majority of the poor are women; many of which are ignorant of or deprived of certain rights like owning land.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=November 2012|title=Gender Statistics Profile|url=https://www.ubos.org/wp-content/uploads/publications/04_2018Justice_Law_and_Order_Sector_Gender_Statistics_Profile.pdf|journal=UGANDA BUREAU OF STATISTICS|volume=JUSTICE, LAW AND ORDER SECTOR|pages=8,9|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gender-based violence has been reported as another issue.  According to authorities within the Ugandan Police Force, many Ugandans accept the battering of women as a long-standing social norm.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-uganda-women-police/male-feminists-inside-ugandas-police-strike-out-at-killing-of-women-idUSKBN1GH1OG|title=Male feminists inside Uganda's police strike out at killing of women|last=Lewton|first=Thomas|work=U.S.|access-date=2018-10-04|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2001, a survey revealed that 90% of women reported that “beating a wife or female partner was justifiable in some circumstances.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/newshour/show/why-the-new-global-wealth-of-educated-women-spurs-backlash|title=Why the new global wealth of educated women spurs backlash|website=PBS NewsHour|language=en-US|access-date=2018-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A 2018 [[Reuters]] article highlighted the concern over gender based violence in covering a story involving 20 corpses of young women along the roadsides south of the [[Kampala]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-uganda-women-police/male-feminists-inside-ugandas-police-strike-out-at-killing-of-women-idUSKBN1GH1OG|title=Male feminists inside Uganda's police strike out at killing of women|last=Lewton|first=Thomas|work=U.S.|access-date=2018-10-04|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to the lack of justice and protection against violence, there is a significant gender gap with education. 

=== The gender gap and education ===
According to the [[World Economic Forum]]'s Global Gender Gap 2017 Report, Uganda is ranked 45 out of 144 countries on the basis of its four key indicators: Economic Participation and Opportunity, Educational Attainment, Health and Survival, and Political Empowerment. Under the country score card section of this report, it revealed that Uganda ranked #1 in primary education enrollment and yet only #127 in secondary education.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://reports.weforum.org/global-gender-gap-report-2017/dataexplorer/#economy=UGA|title=Data Explorer|work=Global Gender Gap Report 2017|access-date=2018-10-21|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; This means that for the majority of girls in Uganda, their schooling is halted before or soon after becoming a teenager. The cultural practice of parents relying heavier on girls more than boys for household labor needs may be a main cause for this disparity in education.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.everyculture.com/To-Z/Uganda.html#ixzz5WhTMsrzH|title=Culture of Uganda - history, people, clothing, women, beliefs, food, family, social, dress|website=www.everyculture.com|access-date=2018-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2013 study done by Martina Björkman-Nyqvist indicated a sharp drop in school enrollment for females when their households faced financial setbacks from a lack of rain/crop production or other economic shortfalls.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Björkman-Nyqvist|first=Martina|date=July 30, 2013|title=Income shocks and gender gaps in education: Evidence from Uganda|url=|journal=Journal of Development Economics|volume=105|pages=237–253|via=Elsevier}}&lt;/ref&gt; And in the districts where schooling was free, it showed a significant drop in the marks earned by female students during the times of economic hardship. Meanwhile, the study showed that boys remained unscathed in either scenario.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Björkman-Nyqvist|first=Martina|date=July 30, 2013|title=Income shocks and gender gaps in education: Evidence from Uganda|url=|journal=Journal of Development Economics|volume=105|pages=237–253|via=Elsevier}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whether it is economic shocks, early unwanted pregnancies or fleeing family violence, many girls have to stop their education prematurely.  As a result, these young women face reduced opportunities for work and a significant amount of them are driven into unhealthy sexual relationships or find themselves doing sex work in Kampala to survive and support their families.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mbonye|first=Martin|last2=Nalukenge|first2=Winifred|last3=Nakamanya|first3=Sarah|last4=Nalusiba|first4=Betty|last5=King|first5=Rachel|last6=Vandepitte|first6=Judith|last7=Seeley|first7=Janet|date=2012-06-14|title=Gender inequity in the lives of women involved in sex work in Kampala, Uganda|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.7448/ias.15.3.17365|journal=Journal of the International AIDS Society|volume=15|issue=3(Suppl 1)|doi=10.7448/ias.15.3.17365|issn=1758-2652}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://scopeblog.stanford.edu/2014/03/19/sex-work-in-uganda-risky-business/|title=Sex work in Uganda: Risky business - Scope|date=2014-03-19|work=Scope|access-date=2018-11-13|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Interventions for gender equality ===
Actions taken to bridge these gender gaps and bring justice have served as a catalyst for development, empowering Ugandan woman to lay hold of various rights, positions and opportunities. In Kasese District, Western Uganda, the Gender Action Learning System (GALS) provides training in the production and trade of the nation’s staples: coffee, maize and fruit. Through initiatives like this, women are positioned to access needed healthcare and education, thus helping them escape the poverty trap. Research findings also indicate a decline in gender-based violence as women become key contributors in bolstering local economies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mayoux|first=Linda|date=December 2012|title=Gender mainstreaming in value chain development: experience with gender action learning system in Uganda|url=|journal=Enterprise development and microfinance|volume=23(4)|pages=319-337|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; An IMF 2016 survey found its gender budgeting very successful in Sub-Sahara countries like Uganda and Rwanda. When targeted funds provide clean water and electricity is accessible, the reduction of daily household chores makes it more feasible to earn the monies needed for a girl’s education.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Stotsky|first=Janet G.|date=July 2016|title=Sub-Saharan Africa: A Survey of Gender Budgeting Efforts.|url=https://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/wp/2016/wp16152.pdf|journal=IMF Working Paper|volume=WP/16/152:|pages=15-16|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through education and couple counseling programs within The AIDS Support Organization (TASO), women learn assertiveness skills that help them better navigate relational choices and safe sex practices.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Muriisa|first=Roberts Kabeba|date=January 2010|title=The Role of NGOs in Addressing Gender Inequality and HIV/AIDS in Uganda|url=|journal=Canadian Journal of African Studies/La Revue canadienne des études africaines|volume=44(3)|pages=605-623|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Clubs such as the Empowerment of Livelihood and Adolescents (ELA) have the goal of helping girls evade teen pregnancy and underage marriage.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://uganda.unfpa.org/en/news/better-life-girls-better-future-uganda|title=UNFPA Uganda {{!}} Better Life for Girls, Better Future for Uganda|website=uganda.unfpa.org|language=en|access-date=2018-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Resistance to changing norms ===
The changing of age old social norms have been met with some resistance and negative repercussion. After public campaigns promoting women's rights, Uganda has been one of the countries noted by the World Health Organization to experience backlash resulting in violence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/newshour/show/why-the-new-global-wealth-of-educated-women-spurs-backlash|title=Why the new global wealth of educated women spurs backlash|website=PBS NewsHour|language=en-US|access-date=2018-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a four-year study in Rakai, Uganda noted widespread uneasiness among both women and men as equality initiatives challenged the concept of a women’s place in the home and society in general. With women gaining more financial autonomy and power in the home, many reported a concern that this challenge to traditional gender roles may cause men to feel threatened and respond with domestic violence. The Rakai study stressed the importance of have community initiatives in place that can broaden cultural understandings in recognizing that there are many benefits as women empowerment and equality is embraced.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mullinax, Margo ; Higgins, Jenny ; Wagman, Jennifer ; Nakyanjo, Neema ; Kigozi, Godfrey ; Serwadda, David ; Wawer, Maria ; Gray, Ronald ; Nalugoda, Fred|first=|date=April 2013|title=Community understandings of and responses to gender equality and empowerment in Rakai, Uganda|url=|journal=Global Public Health|volume=8(4)|pages=465-478|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.usaid.gov/sites/default/files/documents/1860/Gender_Social_Inclusion._Final_Report_08.23.17.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Women began to organize to exercise their political power before independence. In 1960 the Uganda Council of Women passed a resolution urging that laws regarding marriage, divorce, and inheritance should be recorded in written from and publicized nationwide—a first step toward codifying customary and modern practices. During the first decade of independence, this council also pressed for legal reforms that would grant all women the right to own property and retain custody of their children if their marriages ended.&lt;ref name=cs/&gt;

During the 1970s and early 1980s, the violence that swept Uganda inflicted a particularly heavy toll on women. Economic hardships were felt first in the home, where women and children lacked economic choices available to most men. Women's work became more time-consuming than it had been; the erosion of public services and infrastructure reduced access to schools, hospitals, and markets. Even traveling to nearby towns was often impossible. Some Ugandan women believed that the war years strengthened their independence, however, as the disruption of normal family life opened new avenues for acquiring economic independence, and government reports suggested that the number of women employed in commerce increased in the late 1970s and early 1980s.&lt;ref name=cs/&gt;

The Museveni government of the late 1980s pledged to eliminate discrimination against women in official policy and practice. Women are active in the National Resistance Army (NRA), and Museveni appointed a woman, Joan Kakwenzire, to a six-member commission to document abuses by the military. The government also has decreed that one woman would represent each district on the National Resistance Council. In addition, the government-operated Uganda Commercial Bank has launched a rural credit plan to make farm loans more easily available to women.&lt;ref name=cs/&gt;

Museveni appointed [[Joyce Mpanga]] minister for women and development in 1987, and she proclaimed the government's intention to raise women's wages, increase women's credit and employment opportunities, and improve the lives of women in general. In 1989 there were two women serving as ministers and three serving as deputy ministers in the NRM cabinet. Women civil servants and professionals also formed an organization, Action for Development, to assist women in war-torn areas, especially the devastated Luwero region in central Uganda.&lt;ref name=cs/&gt;

The Uganda Association of Women Lawyers, which was founded in 1976, established a legal-aid clinic in early 1988 to defend women who faced the loss of property or children because of divorce, separation, or widowhood. The association also sought to expand educational opportunities for women, increase childsupport payments (equivalent to US$0.50 per month in 1989) in case of divorce, establish common legal grounds for divorce for both men and women, establish common criminal codes for men and women, assist women and children who were victims of AIDS, and implement nationwide education programs to inform women of their legal rights.&lt;ref name=cs/&gt;
