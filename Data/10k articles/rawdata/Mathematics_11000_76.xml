{{Merge to|Graphical projection|date=May 2017}}
'''3D projection''' is any method of mapping three-dimensional points to a two-dimensional plane. As most current methods for displaying graphical data are based on [[Planar (computer graphics)|planar]] (pixel information from several [[bitplanes]]) two-dimensional media, the use of this type of projection is widespread, especially in computer graphics, engineering and [[Technical drawing|drafting]].

== Orthographic projection ==
{{Main|Orthographic projection}}
When the human eye looks at a scene, objects in the distance appear smaller than objects close by. Orthographic projection ignores this effect to allow the creation of to-scale drawings for construction and engineering.

[[Orthographic projection]]s are a small set of transforms often used to show profile, detail or precise measurements of a three dimensional object.  Common names for orthographic projections include plane, cross-section, bird's-eye, and elevation.

If the normal of the viewing plane (the camera direction) is parallel to one of the primary axes (which is the ''x'', ''y'', or ''z'' axis), the mathematical transformation is as follows;
To project the 3D point &lt;math&gt;a_x&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;a_y&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;a_z&lt;/math&gt; onto the 2D point &lt;math&gt;b_x&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;b_y&lt;/math&gt; using an orthographic projection parallel to the y axis (where positive ''y'' represents forward direction - profile view), the following equations can be used:
:&lt;math&gt;
b_x = s_x a_x + c_x
&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;
b_y = s_z a_z + c_z
&lt;/math&gt;
where the vector '''s''' is an arbitrary scale factor, and '''c''' is an arbitrary offset. These constants are optional, and can be used to properly align the viewport. Using [[matrix multiplication]], the equations become:
:&lt;math&gt;
 \begin{bmatrix}
   {b_x }  \\
   {b_y }  \\
\end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix}
   {s_x } &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
   0 &amp; 0 &amp; {s_z }  \\
\end{bmatrix}\begin{bmatrix}
   {a_x }  \\
   {a_y }  \\
   {a_z }  \\
\end{bmatrix} + \begin{bmatrix}
   {c_x }  \\
   {c_z }  \\
\end{bmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;.

While orthographically projected images represent the three dimensional nature of the object projected, they do not represent the object as it would be recorded photographically or perceived by a viewer observing it directly. In particular, parallel lengths at all points in an orthographically projected image are of the same scale regardless of whether they are far away or near to the virtual viewer. As a result, lengths are not foreshortened as they would be in a perspective projection.

== Weak perspective projection ==

A "weak" perspective projection uses the same principles of an orthographic projection, but requires the scaling factor to be specified, thus ensuring that closer objects appear bigger in the projection, and vice versa. It can be seen as a hybrid between an orthographic and a perspective projection, and described either as a perspective projection with individual point depths &lt;math&gt;Z_{i}&lt;/math&gt; replaced by an average constant depth &lt;math&gt;Z_{ave}&lt;/math&gt;,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.cse.iitd.ernet.in/~suban/vision/affine/node5.html |title = The Weak-Perspective Camera |author = Subhashis Banerjee |date = 2002-02-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt; or simply as an orthographic projection plus a scaling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite techreport |first = T. D. |last = Alter |title = 3D Pose from 3 Corresponding Points under Weak-Perspective Projection |url = http://dspace.mit.edu/bitstream/handle/1721.1/6611/AIM-1378.pdf |institution = MIT [[AI Lab]] |date=July 1992 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The weak-perspective model thus approximates perspective projection while using a simpler model, similar to the pure (unscaled) orthographic perspective.
It is a reasonable approximation when the depth of the object along the line of sight is small compared to the distance from the camera, and the field of view is small. With these conditions, it can be assumed that all points on a 3D object are at the same distance &lt;math&gt;Z_{ave}&lt;/math&gt; from the camera without significant errors in the projection (compared to the full perspective model).

'''''Equation'''''
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{array}{lcl}
P_x = \frac{X}{Z_{ave}} \\
P_y = \frac{Y}{Z_{ave}}
\end{array}&lt;/math&gt;
assuming focal length &lt;math&gt;\mathit{f} = 1&lt;/math&gt;.

== Perspective projection ==
{{see also|Perspective (graphical)|Transformation matrix#Perspective projection|l2=Transformation matrix|Camera matrix}}
When the human eye views a scene, objects in the distance appear smaller than objects close by - this is known as [[Perspective (graphical)|perspective]]. While orthographic projection ignores this effect to allow accurate measurements, perspective projection shows distant objects as smaller to provide additional realism.

The perspective projection requires a more involved definition as compared to orthographic projections. A conceptual aid to understanding the mechanics of this projection is to imagine the 2D projection as though the object(s) are being viewed through a camera viewfinder. The camera's position, orientation, and [[field of view]] control the behavior of the projection transformation. The following variables are defined to describe this transformation:
* &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{a}_{x,y,z}&lt;/math&gt; - the 3D position of a point ''A'' that is to be projected.
* &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{c}_{x,y,z}&lt;/math&gt; - the 3D position of a point ''C'' representing the camera.
* &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{\theta}_{x,y,z}&lt;/math&gt; - The [[Orientation (geometry)|orientation]] of the camera (represented by [[Euler angles#Tait–Bryan angles|Tait–Bryan angles]]). 
* &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{e}_{x,y,z}&lt;/math&gt; - the [[Image plane|display surface]]'s position relative to the camera pinhole C&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

}}.&lt;/ref&gt;. Most conventions use positive z values (the plane being in front of the pinhole), however negative z values are physically more correct, but the image will be inverted both horizontally and vertically.
Which results in:
* &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{b}_{x,y}&lt;/math&gt; - the 2D projection of &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{a}&lt;/math&gt;.

When &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{c}_{x,y,z}=\langle 0,0,0\rangle,&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{\theta}_{x,y,z} = \langle 0,0,0\rangle,&lt;/math&gt; the 3D vector &lt;math&gt;\langle 1,2,0 \rangle&lt;/math&gt; is projected to the 2D vector &lt;math&gt;\langle 1,2 \rangle&lt;/math&gt;.

Otherwise, to compute &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{b}_{x,y}&lt;/math&gt; we first define a vector &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{d}_{x,y,z}&lt;/math&gt; as the position of point ''A'' with respect to a [[coordinate system]] defined by the camera, with origin in ''C'' and rotated by &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{\theta}&lt;/math&gt; with respect to the initial coordinate system.  This is achieved by [[Matrix addition|subtracting]] &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{c}&lt;/math&gt; from &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{a}&lt;/math&gt; and then applying a rotation by &lt;math&gt;-\mathbf{\theta}&lt;/math&gt; to the result.  This transformation is often called a '''{{visible anchor|camera transform}}''', and can be expressed as follows, expressing the rotation in terms of rotations about the ''x,'' ''y,'' and ''z'' axes (these calculations assume that the axes are ordered as a [[Cartesian coordinates#Orientation and handedness|left-handed]] system of axes):

This representation corresponds to rotating by three [[Euler angles]] (more properly, [[Euler angles#Tait–Bryan angles|Tait–Bryan angles]]), using the ''xyz'' convention, which can be interpreted either as "rotate about the ''extrinsic'' axes (axes of the ''scene'') in the order ''z, y, x'' (reading right-to-left)" or "rotate about the ''intrinsic'' axes (axes of the ''camera'') in the order ''x, y, z'' (reading left-to-right)". Note that if the camera is not rotated (&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{\theta}_{x,y,z} = \langle 0,0,0\rangle&lt;/math&gt;), then the matrices drop out (as identities), and this reduces to simply a shift: &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{d} = \mathbf{a} - \mathbf{c}.&lt;/math&gt;

Alternatively, without using matrices (let's replace (a&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;-c&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;) with '''x''' and so on, and abbreviate cosθ to ''c'' and sinθ to ''s''):
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{array}{lcl}
	\mathbf{d}_x = c_y (s_z \mathbf{y}+c_z \mathbf{x})-s_y \mathbf{z} \\
	\mathbf{d}_y = s_x (c_y \mathbf{z}+s_y (s_z \mathbf{y}+c_z \mathbf{x}))+c_x (c_z \mathbf{y}-s_z \mathbf{x}) \\
	\mathbf{d}_z = c_x (c_y \mathbf{z}+s_y (s_z \mathbf{y}+c_z \mathbf{x}))-s_x (c_z \mathbf{y}-s_z \mathbf{x}) \\
\end{array}
&lt;/math&gt;
This transformed point can then be projected onto the 2D plane using the formula (here, ''x/y'' is used as the projection plane; literature also may use ''x/z''):&lt;ref&gt;

\end{array}.
&lt;/math&gt;

Or, in matrix form using [[homogeneous coordinates]], the system
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{bmatrix}
   \mathbf{f}_x \\
   \mathbf{f}_y \\
   \mathbf{f}_z \\
   \mathbf{f}_w \\

\end{bmatrix}\begin{bmatrix}
   \mathbf{d}_x  \\
   \mathbf{d}_y  \\
   \mathbf{d}_z  \\
   1 \\
\end{bmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;
in conjunction with an argument using similar triangles, leads to division by the homogeneous coordinate, giving
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{array}{lcl}
 \mathbf{b}_x &amp;= &amp;\mathbf{f}_x / \mathbf{f}_w \\
 \mathbf{b}_y &amp;= &amp;\mathbf{f}_y / \mathbf{f}_w \\
\end{array}.
&lt;/math&gt;

The distance of the viewer from the display surface, &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{e}_z&lt;/math&gt;, directly relates to the field of view, where &lt;math&gt;\alpha=2 \cdot \arctan(1/\mathbf{e}_z)&lt;/math&gt; is the viewed angle. (Note: This assumes that you map the points (-1,-1) and (1,1) to the corners of your viewing surface)

The above equations can also be rewritten as:
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{array}{lcl}
 \mathbf{b}_x= (\mathbf{d}_x \mathbf{s}_x ) / (\mathbf{d}_z \mathbf{r}_x) \mathbf{r}_z\\
 \mathbf{b}_y= (\mathbf{d}_y \mathbf{s}_y ) / (\mathbf{d}_z \mathbf{r}_y) \mathbf{r}_z\\
\end{array}.
&lt;/math&gt;
In which &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{s}_{x,y}&lt;/math&gt; is the display size, &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{r}_{x,y}&lt;/math&gt; is the recording surface size ([[Charge-coupled device|CCD]] or [[film]]), &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{r}_z&lt;/math&gt; is the distance from the recording surface to the [[entrance pupil]] ([[pinhole camera model|camera center]]), and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{d}_z&lt;/math&gt; is the distance, from the 3D point being projected, to the entrance pupil.

Subsequent clipping and scaling operations may be necessary to map the 2D plane onto any particular display media.

== Diagram ==

[[File:Perspective transform diagram.svg]]

To determine which screen ''x''-coordinate corresponds to a point at &lt;math&gt;A_x,A_z&lt;/math&gt; multiply the point coordinates by:
:&lt;math&gt;B_x = A_x \frac{B_z}{A_z}&lt;/math&gt;
where 
:&lt;math&gt;B_x&lt;/math&gt; is the screen ''x'' coordinate
:&lt;math&gt;A_x&lt;/math&gt; is the model ''x'' coordinate
:&lt;math&gt;B_z&lt;/math&gt; is the [[focal length]]&amp;mdash;the axial distance from the [[camera center]] to the [[image plane]]
:&lt;math&gt;A_z&lt;/math&gt; is the subject distance. 
Because the camera is in 3D, the same works for the screen ''y''-coordinate, substituting ''y'' for ''x'' in the above diagram and equation.

In [[computer programming]], especially [[functional programming]] and [[type theory]], an '''algebraic data type''' is a kind of [[composite type]], i.e., a type formed by combining other types.

Two common classes of algebraic types are [[product type]]s (i.e., [[tuple]]s and [[record (computer science)|records]]) and [[sum type]]s (i.e., tagged or disjoint unions or ''variant types'').&lt;ref&gt;[http://caml.inria.fr/pub/docs/manual-ocaml/manual003.html#toc7 Records and variants] - OCaml manual section 1.4{{dead link|date=October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[value (computer science)|values]] of a product type typically contain several values, called ''fields''.  All values of that type have the same combination of field types.  The set of all possible values of a product type is the set-theoretic product, i.e., the [[Cartesian product]], of the sets of all possible values of its field types.

The values of a sum type are typically grouped into several classes, called ''variants''.  A value of a variant type is usually created with a quasi-functional entity called a ''constructor''.  Each variant has its own constructor, which takes a specified number of arguments with specified types.  The set of all possible values of a sum type is the set-theoretic sum, i.e., the [[disjoint union]], of the sets of all possible values of its variants. [[Enumerated type]]s are a special case of sum types in which the constructors take no arguments, as exactly one value is defined for each constructor.

Values of algebraic types are analyzed with [[pattern matching]], which identifies a value by its constructor or field names and extracts the data it contains.

Algebraic data types were introduced in [[Hope (programming language)|Hope]], a small functional programming language developed in the 1970s at the [[University of Edinburgh]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |quote=Presentations included Rod Burstall, Dave MacQueen, and Don Sannella on Hope, the language that introduced algebraic data types |title=A history of Haskell: being lazy with class |url=http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1238856 |author1=Paul Hudak |author2=John Hughes |author3=Simon Peyton Jones |author4=Philip Wadler |booktitle=Proceedings of the third ACM SIGPLAN conference on History of programming languages}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==
One of the most common examples of  an algebraic data type is the singly linked list. A list type is a sum type with two variants, &lt;code&gt;Nil&lt;/code&gt; for an empty list and &lt;code&gt;Cons ''x'' ''xs''&lt;/code&gt; for the combination of a new element ''x'' with a list ''xs'' to create a new list. Here is an example of how a singly linked list would be declared in [[Haskell (programming language)|Haskell]]:
&lt;source lang="haskell"&gt;
data List a = Nil | Cons a (List a)
&lt;/source&gt;
&lt;code&gt;Cons&lt;/code&gt; is an abbreviation of ''cons''truct. Many languages have special syntax for lists defined in this way. For example, Haskell and [[ML (programming language)|ML]] use &lt;code&gt;[]&lt;/code&gt; for &lt;code&gt;Nil&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;:&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;::&lt;/code&gt; for &lt;code&gt;Cons&lt;/code&gt;, respectively, and square brackets for entire lists. So &lt;code&gt;Cons 1 (Cons 2 (Cons 3 Nil))&lt;/code&gt; would normally be written as &lt;code&gt;1:2:3:[]&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;[1,2,3]&lt;/code&gt; in Haskell, or as &lt;code&gt;1::2::3::[]&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;[1;2;3]&lt;/code&gt; in ML.

For a slightly more complex example, [[binary tree]]s may be implemented in Haskell as follows:
&lt;source lang="haskell"&gt;
data Tree = Empty
          | Leaf Int
          | Node Tree Tree
&lt;/source&gt;

Here, &lt;code&gt;Empty&lt;/code&gt; represents an empty tree, &lt;code&gt;Leaf&lt;/code&gt; contains a piece of data, and &lt;code&gt;Node&lt;/code&gt; organizes the data into branches.

In most languages that support algebraic data types, it is possible to define [[parametric polymorphism|parametric]] types. Examples are given later in this article.

Somewhat similar to a function, a data constructor is applied to arguments of an appropriate type, yielding an instance of the data type to which the type constructor belongs. For example, the data constructor &lt;code&gt;Leaf&lt;/code&gt; is logically a function &lt;code&gt;Int -&gt; Tree&lt;/code&gt;, meaning that giving an integer as an argument to &lt;code&gt;Leaf&lt;/code&gt; produces a value of the type &lt;code&gt;Tree&lt;/code&gt;. As &lt;code&gt;Node&lt;/code&gt; takes two arguments of the type &lt;code&gt;Tree&lt;/code&gt; itself, the datatype is [[recursive type|recursive]].

Operations on algebraic data types can be defined by using [[pattern matching]] to retrieve the arguments. For example, consider a function to find the depth of a &lt;code&gt;Tree&lt;/code&gt;, given here in Haskell:

&lt;source lang="haskell"&gt;
 depth :: Tree -&gt; Int
 depth Empty = 0
 depth (Leaf n) = 1
 depth (Node l r) = 1 + max (depth l) (depth r)
&lt;/source&gt;

Thus, a &lt;code&gt;Tree&lt;/code&gt; given to &lt;code&gt;depth&lt;/code&gt; can be constructed using any of &lt;code&gt;Empty&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;Leaf&lt;/code&gt;, or &lt;code&gt;Node&lt;/code&gt; and must be matched for any of them respectively to deal with all cases. In case of &lt;code&gt;Node&lt;/code&gt;, the pattern extracts the subtrees &lt;code&gt;l&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;r&lt;/code&gt; for further processing.

Algebraic data types are highly suited to implementing [[abstract syntax]].  For example, the following algebraic data type describes a simple language representing numerical expressions:

&lt;source lang="haskell"&gt;
data Expression = Number Int
                | Add Expression Expression
                | Minus Expression Expression
                | Mult Expression Expression
                | Divide Expression Expression
&lt;/source&gt;

An element of such a data type would have a form such as &lt;code&gt;Mult (Add (Number 4) (Minus (Number 0) (Number 1))) (Number 2)&lt;/code&gt;.

Writing an evaluation function for this language is a simple exercise; however, more complex transformations also become feasible.  For example, an optimization pass in a compiler might be written as a function taking an abstract expression as input and returning an optimized form.

==Explanation==
What is happening is that there is a datatype which can be ''one of several types of things''. Each ''type of thing'' is associated with an identifier called a ''constructor'', which can be viewed as a kind of tag for that kind of data. Each constructor can carry with it a different type of data. A constructor could carry no data (e.g., "Empty" in the example above), or one piece of data (e.g., “Leaf” has one Int value), or multiple pieces of data (e.g., “Node” has two Tree values).

To do something with a value of this Tree algebraic data type, it is ''deconstructed'' using a process termed ''pattern matching''. It involves ''matching'' the data with a series of ''patterns''. The example function "depth" above pattern-matches its argument with three patterns. When the function is called, it finds the first pattern that matches its argument, performs any variable bindings that are found in the pattern, and evaluates the expression corresponding to the pattern.

Each pattern above has a form that resembles the structure of some possible value of this datatype. The first pattern simply matches values of the constructor ''Empty''. The second pattern matches values of the constructor ''Leaf''. Patterns are recursive, so then the data that is associated with that constructor is matched with the pattern "n". In this case, a lowercase identifier represents a pattern that matches any value, which then is bound to a variable of that name — in this case, a variable “&lt;code&gt;n&lt;/code&gt;” is bound to the integer value stored in the data type — to be used in the expression to evaluate.

The recursion in patterns in this example are trivial, but a possible more complex recursive pattern would be something like &lt;code&gt;&lt;source lang="lisp" enclose="none"&gt;Node (Node (Leaf 4) x) (Node y (Node Empty z))&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/code&gt;. Recursive patterns several layers deep are used for example in balancing [[red-black tree]]s, which involve cases that require looking at colors several layers deep.

The example above is operationally equivalent to the following pseudocode:

 switch on (data.constructor)
   case Empty:
     return 0
   case Leaf:
     let n = data.field1
     return 1
   case Node:
     let l = data.field1
     let r = data.field2
     return 1 + max (depth l) (depth r)

The comparison of this with pattern matching will point out some of the advantages of algebraic data types and pattern matching. The first advantage is [[type safety]]. The pseudocode above relies on the diligence of the programmer to not access &lt;tt&gt;field2&lt;/tt&gt; when the constructor is a Leaf, for example. Also, the type of &lt;tt&gt;field1&lt;/tt&gt; is different for Leaf and Node (for Leaf it is &lt;tt&gt;Int&lt;/tt&gt;; for Node it is &lt;tt&gt;Tree&lt;/tt&gt;), so the type system would have difficulties assigning a static type to it in a safe way in a traditional [[record (computer science)|record]] data structure. However, in pattern matching, the type of each extracted value is checked based on the types declared by the relevant constructor, and how many values can be extracted is known based on the constructor, so it does not face these problems.

Second, in pattern matching, the compiler statically checks that all cases are handled. If one of the cases of the ''depth'' function above were missing, the compiler would issue a warning, indicating that a case is not handled. This task may seem easy for the simple patterns above, but with many complex recursive patterns, the task becomes difficult for the average human (or compiler, if it must check arbitrary nested if-else constructs) to handle. Similarly, there may be patterns which never match (i.e., are already covered by prior patterns), and the compiler can also check and issue warnings for these, as they may indicate an error in reasoning.

Do not confuse these patterns with [[regular expression]] patterns used in string pattern matching. The purpose is similar: to check whether a piece of data matches certain constraints, and if so, extract relevant parts of it for processing. However, the mechanism is very different. This kind of pattern matching on algebraic data types matches on the structural properties of an object rather than on the character sequence of strings.

==Theory==
{{main|Recursive data type}}

A general algebraic data type is a possibly recursive [[sum type]] of [[product type]]s. Each constructor tags a product type to separate it from others, or if there is only one constructor, the data type is a product type. Further, the parameter types of a constructor are the factors of the product type. A parameterless constructor corresponds to the [[empty product]]. If a datatype is recursive, the entire sum of products is wrapped in a [[recursive type]], and each constructor also rolls the datatype into the recursive type.

For example, the Haskell datatype:

&lt;source lang="haskell"&gt;
 data List a = Nil | Cons a (List a)
&lt;/source&gt;

is represented in [[type theory]] as
&lt;math&gt;\lambda \alpha. \mu \beta. 1 + \alpha \times \beta&lt;/math&gt;
with constructors &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{nil}_\alpha = \mathrm{roll}\ (\mathrm{inl}\ \langle\rangle)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{cons}_\alpha\ x\ l = \mathrm{roll}\ (\mathrm{inr}\ \langle x, l\rangle)&lt;/math&gt;.

The Haskell List datatype can also be represented in type theory in a slightly different form, thus:
&lt;math&gt;\mu \phi. \lambda \alpha. 1 + \alpha \times \phi\ \alpha&lt;/math&gt;.
(Note how the &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; constructs are reversed relative to the original.) The original formation specified a type function which body was a recursive type. The revised version specifies a recursive function on types. (The type variable &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; is used to suggest a function rather than a ''base type'' like &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt;, since &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; is like a Greek ''f''.) The function must also now be applied &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; to its argument type &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; in the body of the type.

For the purposes of the List example, these two formulations are not significantly different; but the second form allows expressing so-called [[nested data type]]s, i.e., those where the recursive type differs parametrically from the original. (For more information on nested data types, see the works of [[Richard Bird (computer scientist)|Richard Bird]], [[Lambert Meertens]], and Ross Paterson.)

In [[set theory]] the equivalent of a sum type is a [[disjoint union]], a set which elements are pairs consisting of a tag (equivalent to a constructor) and an object of a type corresponding to the tag (equivalent to the constructor arguments).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7009">In [[computer science]], '''all-pairs testing''' or '''pairwise testing''' is a [[combinatorial]] method of [[software testing]] that, for ''each pair'' of input parameters to a system (typically, a [[software]] [[algorithm]]), tests all possible discrete combinations of those parameters. Using carefully chosen [[test vector]]s, this can be done much faster than an exhaustive search of [[Software testing#Input combinations and preconditions|all combinations]] of all parameters, by "parallelizing" the tests of parameter pairs.

== Rationale ==

The most common bugs in a program are generally triggered by either a single input parameter or an interaction between pairs of parameters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Black |first=Rex |year=2007 |title=Pragmatic Software Testing: Becoming an Effective and Efficient Test Professional |publisher=[[John Wiley &amp; Sons|Wiley]] |location=New York |isbn=978-0-470-12790-2 |page=240}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Bugs involving interactions between three or more parameters are both progressively less common &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Kuhn |first1=D. Richard |last2=Wallace |first2=Dolores R. |last3=Gallo |first3=Albert M., Jr. |date=June 2004 |title=Software Fault Interactions and Implications for Software Testing |journal=IEEE Trans. on Software Engineering |volume=30 |issue=6 |pages=1–4 |url=http://csrc.nist.gov/staff/Kuhn/kuhn-wallace-gallo-04.pdf |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; and also progressively more expensive to find---such testing has as its limit the testing of all possible inputs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report |last1=Kuhn |first1=D. Richard |last2=Kacker |first2=Raghu N. |author3=Yu Lei |year=October 2010 |title=Practical Combinatorial Testing. SP 800-142. |publisher=[[National Institute of Standards and Technology]] |doi=10.6028/NIST.SP.800-142}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, a combinatorial technique for picking test cases like all-pairs testing is a useful cost-benefit compromise that enables a significant reduction in the number of test cases without drastically compromising functional coverage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |date=July 18, 2008 |title=IEEE 12. Proceedings from the 5th International Conference on Software Testing and Validation (ICST). Software Competence Center Hagenberg. "Test Design: Lessons Learned and Practical Implications. |doi=10.1109/IEEESTD.2008.4578383 |pages=1–150 |url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/freeabs_all.jsp?arnumber=4578383}}&lt;/ref&gt;

More rigorously, if we assume that a test case has &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; parameters given in a set &lt;math&gt;\{ P_i\} = \{ P_1 , P_2 , ... , P_N \}&lt;/math&gt;.
The range of the parameters are given by &lt;math&gt;R(P_i)= R_i&lt;/math&gt;.
Let's assume that &lt;math&gt;|R_i|= n_i&lt;/math&gt;.
We note that the number of all possible test cases is a &lt;math&gt;\prod n_i&lt;/math&gt;. Imagining that the code deals with the conditions taking only two parameters at a time, might reduce the number of needed test cases.{{clarify|date=March 2016|reason=This clause is not well-formed, and the extraneous comma and the ambiguous placement of "taking only two pair at a time" obscure its meaning.}}

To demonstrate, suppose there are X,Y,Z parameters.
We can use a [[Predicate (mathematical logic)|predicate]] of the form &lt;math&gt;P(X,Y,Z) &lt;/math&gt; of order 3, which takes all 3 as input, or rather three different order 2 predicates of the form &lt;math&gt; p(u,v) &lt;/math&gt;. &lt;math&gt;P(X,Y,Z)&lt;/math&gt; can be written in an equivalent form of &lt;math&gt;p_{xy}(X,Y) ,  p_{yz}(Y,Z) , p_{zx}(Z,X)&lt;/math&gt; where comma denotes any combination. If the code is written as conditions taking "pairs" of parameters,
then the set of choices of ranges &lt;math&gt;X = \{ n_i \}&lt;/math&gt; can be a [[multiset]]{{clarify|date=June 2012}}, because there can be multiple parameters having same number of choices.

&lt;math&gt;max(S)&lt;/math&gt; is one of the maximum of the multiset &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt;
The number of pair-wise test cases on this test function would be:-
&lt;math&gt;
T =  max(X) \times max ( X \setminus max(X) )
&lt;/math&gt;

Therefore, if the &lt;math&gt; n = max(X) &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; m =  max ( X \setminus max(X) ) &lt;/math&gt; then the number of tests is typically O(''nm''), where ''n'' and ''m'' are the number of possibilities for each of the two parameters  with the most choices, and it can be quite a lot less than the exhaustive &lt;math&gt;\prod n_i&lt;/math&gt;·

== N-wise testing ==

N-wise testing can be considered the generalized form of pair-wise testing.{{cn|date=July 2012}}

The idea is to apply [[sorting]] to the set  &lt;math&gt;X = \{ n_i \}&lt;/math&gt; so that &lt;math&gt;P = \{ P_i \}&lt;/math&gt; gets ordered too.
Let the sorted set be a  &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; tuple :-

&lt;math&gt;
P_s = &lt;  P_i  &gt; \;  ; \; i &lt; j \implies |R(P_i)| &lt; |R(P_j)|
&lt;/math&gt;

Now we can take the set &lt;math&gt;X(2) = \{ P_{N-1} , P_{N-2}  \}&lt;/math&gt; and call it the pairwise testing.
Generalizing further we can take the set &lt;math&gt;X(3) = \{ P_{N-1} , P_{N-2} , P_{N-3}  \}&lt;/math&gt; and call it the 3-wise testing.
Eventually, we can say &lt;math&gt;X(T) = \{ P_{N-1} , P_{N-2} , ... , P_{N-T}  \}&lt;/math&gt;  T-wise testing.

The N-wise testing then would just be, all possible combinations from the above formula.

== Example ==

Consider the parameters shown in the table below.

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Parameter name !! Value 1 !! Value 2 || Value 3 || Value 4
|-
| Enabled || True || False || * || *
|-
| Choice type || 1 || 2 || 3 || *
|-
| Category || a || b || c || d
|}

'Enabled', 'Choice Type' and 'Category' have a choice range of 2, 3 and 4, respectively. An exhaustive test would involve 24 tests (2 x 3 x 4). Multiplying the two largest values (3 and 4) indicates that a pair-wise tests would involve 12 tests. The pict tool generated pairwise test cases is shown below.

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Enabled   !! Choice type  !! Category
|-
| True || 3 || a
|-
| True || 1 || d
|-
| False || 1 || c
|-
| False || 2 || d
|-
| True || 2 || c
|-
| False || 2 || a
|-
| False || 1 || a
|-
| False || 3 || b
|-
| True || 2 || b
|-
| True || 3 || d
|-
| False || 3 || c
|-
| True || 1 || b
|}

In [[potential theory]], a mathematical discipline, '''balayage''' (from French: ''[[wiktionary:fr:balayage|balayage]]'' "scanning, sweeping") is a method devised by [[Henri Poincaré]] for reconstructing a [[harmonic function]] in a domain from its values on the boundary of the domain.&lt;ref&gt;{{SpringerEOM| title=Balayage method | id=Balayage_method | oldid=11819 | first=E.D. | last=Solomentsev }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In modern terms, the '''balayage operator''' maps a [[Measure (mathematics)|measure]] ''&amp;mu;'' on a closed domain ''D'' to a measure ''&amp;nu;'' on the boundary ''&amp;part; D'', so that the [[Newtonian potential]]s of ''&amp;mu;'' and ''&amp;nu;'' coincide outside ''D''. The procedure is called balayage since the mass is "swept out" from ''D'' onto the boundary.

For ''x'' in ''D'', the balayage of [[Dirac delta function|''&amp;delta;''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt;]] yields the [[harmonic measure]] ''&amp;nu;''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt; corresponding to ''x''. Then the value of a harmonic function ''f'' at ''x'' is equal to

:&lt;math&gt; f(x) = \int_{\partial D} f(y) \, d\nu_x(y).&lt;/math&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2260">In [[computational complexity theory]], a '''certificate''' (also called a '''witness''') is a string that certifies the answer to a computation, or certifies the membership of some string in a language. A certificate is often thought of as a solution path within a verification process, which is used to check whether a problem gives the answer "Yes" or "No". 

In the [[decision tree model]] of computation, certificate complexity is the minimum number of the &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; input variables of a [[decision tree]] that need to be assigned a value in order to definitely establish the value of the [[Boolean function]] &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt;.

== Definition ==

The notion of certificate is used to define semi-decidability:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Cook|first=Stephen|title=Computability and Noncomputability|url=http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~sacook/csc463h/notes/comp.pdf|accessdate=7 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

L ∈ SD iff there is a two-place predicate R ⊆ Σ∗ × Σ∗ such that R is computable, and such that for all x ∈ Σ∗:
    x ∈ L ⇔ there exists y such that R(x, y)

It can also be used to define the class [[NP (complexity)|NP]]:

L ∈ NP iff there is a [[polytime]] verifier V such that:
    x ∈ L ⇔ there exists y such that |y| &lt;= |x|&lt;sup&gt;c&lt;/sup&gt; and V accepts (x, y)

==Example==
  L = {&lt;&lt;M&gt;, x, w&gt; | does &lt;M&gt; accept x in |w| steps?}
  Show L ∈ NP.
  '''verifier:'''
    gets string c = &lt;M&gt;, x, w such that |c| &lt;= P(|w|)
    check if c is an accepting computation of M on x with at most |w| steps
    |c| &lt;= O(|w|&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;)
    if we have a computation of a TM with k steps the total size of the computation string is k&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;
    Thus, &lt;&lt;M&gt;, x, w&gt; ∈ L ⇔ there exists c &lt;= a|w|&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; such that &lt;&lt;M&gt;, x, w, c&gt; ∈ V ∈ P

In [[geometry]], the '''circumference''' (from Latin ''circumferentia'', meaning "carrying around") of a [[circle]] is the (linear) distance around it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www-rohan.sdsu.edu/~pwbrock/files/UNIT9.3.pdf | title =Perimeter, Area and Circumference | author =[[San Diego State University]] | publisher =[[Addison-Wesley]] | year =2004| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006153741/http://www-rohan.sdsu.edu/~pwbrock/files/UNIT9.3.pdf|archive-date=6 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; That is, the circumference would be the length of the circle if it were opened up and straightened out to a [[line segment]]. Since a circle is the [[Edge (geometry)|edge (boundary)]] of a [[Disk (geometry)|disk]], circumference is a special case of [[perimeter]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first1=Jeffrey|last1=Bennett|first2=William|last2=Briggs|title=Using and Understanding Mathematics / A Quantitative Reasoning Approach|edition=3rd|publisher=Addison-Wesley|year=2005|isbn=978-0-321-22773-7|page=580}} &lt;/ref&gt; The perimeter is the length around any closed figure and is the term used for most figures excepting the circle and some circular-like figures such as [[ellipse]]s.
Informally, "circumference" may also refer to the edge itself rather than to the length of the edge.

== Circumference of a circle ==
[[File:Circle-withsegments.svg|thumb|210px|left|Circle illustration with circumference (C) in black, diameter (D) in cyan, radius (R) in red, and centre or origin (O) in magenta. Circumference = {{pi}} × diameter = 2 × {{pi}} × radius.]]
The circumference of a circle is the distance around it, but if, as in many elementary treatments, distance is defined in terms of straight lines, this can not be used as a definition. Under these circumstances, the circumference of a circle may be defined as the [[Limit (mathematics)|limit]] of the perimeters of inscribed [[regular polygon]]s as the number of sides increases without bound.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first=Harold R.|last=Jacobs|title=Geometry|year=1974|publisher=W. H. Freeman and Co.|isbn=0-7167-0456-0|page=565}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term circumference is used when measuring physical objects, as well as when considering abstract geometric forms.
[[File:Pi-unrolled-720.gif|thumb|240px|When a circle's [[diameter]] is 1, its circumference is {{pi}}.]]
[[File:2pi-unrolled.gif|thumb|240px|When a circle's [[radius]] is 1—called a [[unit circle]]—its circumference is 2{{pi}}.]]

=== Relationship with {{pi}} ===
The circumference of a [[circle]] is related to one of the most important [[mathematical constant]]s. This [[Constant (mathematics)|constant]], [[pi]], is represented by the [[Greek letter]] [[Pi (letter)|{{pi}}]]. The first few decimal digits of the numerical value of {{pi}} are 3.141592653589793 ...&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite OEIS|A000796}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pi is defined as the [[ratio]] of a circle's circumference {{math|''C''}} to its [[diameter]] {{math|''d''}}:

:&lt;math&gt; \pi = \frac{C}{d}.&lt;/math&gt;

Or, equivalently, as the ratio of the circumference to twice the [[radius]]. The above formula can be rearranged to solve for the circumference:

:&lt;math&gt;{C}=\pi\cdot{d}=2\pi\cdot{r}.\!&lt;/math&gt;

The use of the mathematical constant {{pi}} is ubiquitous in mathematics, engineering, and science. 

In ''[[Measurement of a Circle]]'' written circa 250 BCE, [[Archimedes]] showed that this ratio ({{math|''C''/''d''}}, since he did not use the name {{pi}}) was greater than 3{{sfrac|10|71}} but less than 3{{sfrac|1|7}} by calculating the perimeters of an inscribed and a circumscribed regular polygon of 96 sides.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first=Victor J.|last=Katz|title=A History of Mathematics / An Introduction|edition=2nd|year=1998|publisher=Addison-Wesley Longman|isbn=978-0-321-01618-8|page=109}}&lt;/ref&gt; This method for approximating {{pi}} was used for centuries, obtaining more accuracy by using polygons of larger and larger number of sides. The last such calculation was performed in 1630 by [[Christoph Grienberger]] who used polygons with 10&lt;sup&gt;40&lt;/sup&gt; sides.

== Circumference of an ellipse ==
{{main|Ellipse#Circumference}}
Circumference is used by some authors to denote the perimeter of an ellipse. There is no general formula for the circumference of an ellipse in terms of the [[semi-major and semi-minor axes]] of the ellipse that uses only elementary functions. However, there are approximate formulas in terms of these parameters. One such approximation, due to Euler (1773), for the canonical ellipse, 
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{x^2}{a^2} + \frac{y^2}{b^2} = 1,&lt;/math&gt;
is 
:&lt;math&gt;C_{\rm{ellipse}} \sim \pi \sqrt{2(a^2 + b^2)}.&lt;/math&gt;
Some lower and upper bounds on the circumference of the canonical ellipse with &lt;math&gt;a\geq b&lt;/math&gt; are&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jameson|first1=G.J.O.|title=Inequalities for the perimeter of an ellipse| journal= Mathematical Gazette|volume= 98 |year=2014|pages=227–234|doi=10.2307/3621497}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;2\pi b\le C\le 2\pi a,&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\pi (a+b)\le C\le 4(a+b),&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;4\sqrt{a^2+b^2}\le C\le \pi \sqrt{2(a^2+b^2)} .&lt;/math&gt;

Here the upper bound &lt;math&gt;2\pi a&lt;/math&gt; is the circumference of a [[circumscribed circle|circumscribed]] [[concentric circle]] passing through the endpoints of the ellipse's major axis, and the lower bound &lt;math&gt;4\sqrt{a^2+b^2}&lt;/math&gt; is the [[perimeter]] of an [[inscribed figure|inscribed]] [[rhombus]] with [[vertex (geometry)|vertices]] at the endpoints of the major and minor axes.

The circumference of an ellipse can be expressed exactly in terms of the [[complete elliptic integral of the second kind]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first1=Gert|last1=Almkvist|first2=Bruce|last2=Berndt|title=Gauss, Landen, Ramanujan, the arithmetic-geometric mean, ellipses, {{pi}}, and the Ladies Diary|journal=American Mathematical Monthly|year=1988|pages=585–608|volume=95|mr=966232|doi=10.2307/2323302}}&lt;/ref&gt; More precisely, we have
:&lt;math&gt;C_{\rm{ellipse}} = 4a\int_0^{\pi/2}\sqrt {1 - e^2 \sin^2\theta}\ d\theta,&lt;/math&gt;
where again &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; is the length of the semi-major axis and &lt;math&gt;e&lt;/math&gt; is the eccentricity &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{1 - b^2/a^2}.&lt;/math&gt;

== Circumference of a graph ==
In [[graph theory]] the circumference of a [[Graph (discrete mathematics)|graph]] refers to the longest (simple) [[cycle (graph theory)|cycle]] contained in that graph.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first=Frank|last=Harary|title=Graph Theory|year=1969|publisher=Addison-Wesley|isbn=0-201-02787-9|page=13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5722">In [[mathematics]], '''convex geometry''' is the branch of [[geometry]] studying [[convex set]]s, mainly in [[Euclidean space]]. Convex sets occur naturally in many areas: [[computational geometry]], [[convex analysis]], [[discrete geometry]], [[functional analysis]], [[geometry of numbers]], [[integral geometry]], [[linear programming]], [[probability theory]], etc.

==Classification==
According to the [[Mathematics Subject Classification]] MSC2010,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.msc2010.org/mscwiki/index.php?title=MSC2010 Website of Mathematics Subject Classification MSC2010]&lt;/ref&gt; the mathematical discipline ''Convex and Discrete Geometry'' includes three major branches:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.msc2010.org/mscwiki/index.php?title=52-XX Mathematics Subject Classification MSC2010, entry 52 "Convex and discrete geometry"]&lt;/ref&gt;
* general convexity
* polytopes and polyhedra
* discrete geometry
(though only portions of the latter two are included in convex geometry).

General convexity is further subdivided as follows:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.msc2010.org/mscwiki/index.php?title=52Axx Mathematics Subject Classification MSC2010, entry 52A "General convexity"]&lt;/ref&gt;  
*axiomatic and generalized convexity			
*convex sets without dimension restrictions 			
*convex sets in topological vector spaces  			
*convex sets in 2 dimensions (including convex curves) 		
*convex sets in 3 dimensions (including convex surfaces) 	
*convex sets in ''n'' dimensions (including convex hypersurfaces) 		
*finite-dimensional Banach spaces				
*random convex sets and integral geometry 
*asymptotic theory of convex bodies 
*approximation by convex sets 					
*variants of convex sets (star-shaped, (''m, n'')-convex, etc.) 		
*Helly-type theorems and geometric transversal theory		
*other problems of combinatorial convexity  			
*length, area, volume 						
*[[mixed volume]]s and related topics  			
*inequalities and extremum problems  		
*convex functions and convex programs 
*spherical and hyperbolic convexity  		

The term ''convex geometry'' is also used in [[combinatorics]] as an alternate name for an [[antimatroid]], which is one of the abstract models of convex sets.

==Historical note==
Convex geometry is a relatively young mathematical discipline. Although the first known contributions to convex geometry date back to antiquity and can be traced in the works of [[Euclid]] and [[Archimedes]], it became an  independent branch of mathematics at the turn of the 20th century, mainly due to the works of [[Hermann Brunn]] and [[Hermann Minkowski]] in dimensions two and three. A big part of their results was soon generalized to spaces of higher dimensions, and in 1934 [[Tommy Bonnesen|T. Bonnesen]] and [[Werner Fenchel|W. Fenchel]] gave a comprehensive survey of convex geometry in [[Euclidean space]] '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;. Further development of convex geometry in the 20th century and its relations to numerous mathematical disciplines are summarized in the ''Handbook of convex geometry'' edited by P. M. Gruber and J. M. Wills.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1746">'''Cramér's theorem''' is a fundamental result in the [[Large deviations theory|theory of large deviations]], a subdiscipline of [[probability theory]]. It determines the [[rate function]] of a series of [[iid]] [[random variable]]s.
A weak version of this result was first shown by [[Harald Cramér]] in 1938.

== Statement ==
The logarithmic moment generating function (which is the [[cumulant]]-generating function) of a [[random variable]] is defined as:
:&lt;math&gt; \Lambda(t)=\log \operatorname E [\exp(tX_1)]. &lt;/math&gt;

Let &lt;math&gt; X_1, X_2, \dots &lt;/math&gt; be a series of [[iid]] real [[random variables]] with finite logarithmic moment generating function, e.g. &lt;math&gt; \Lambda(t) &lt; \infty &lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt; t \in \mathbb R &lt;/math&gt;.

Then the [[Legendre transform]] of &lt;math&gt; \Lambda &lt;/math&gt;:
:&lt;math&gt; \Lambda^*(x):= \sup_{t \in \mathbb R} \left(tx-\Lambda(t) \right) &lt;/math&gt;

satisfies,

:&lt;math&gt; \lim_{n \to \infty} \frac 1n \log \left(P\left(\sum_{i=1}^n X_i \geq nx \right)\right) = -\Lambda^*(x) &lt;/math&gt;

for all &lt;math&gt; x &gt; \operatorname E[X_1]. &lt;/math&gt;

In the terminology of the theory of large deviations the result can be reformulated as follows:

If &lt;math&gt; X_1, X_2, \dots &lt;/math&gt; is a series of iid random variables, then the distributions &lt;math&gt; \left(\mathcal L ( \tfrac 1n \sum_{i=1}^n X_i) \right)_{n \in \N}&lt;/math&gt; satisfy a [[large deviation principle]] with [[rate function]] &lt;math&gt; \Lambda^* &lt;/math&gt;.

In [[geometry]] and [[topology]], '''crumpling''' is the process whereby a sheet of paper or other two-dimensional [[manifold]] undergoes disordered [[deformation (engineering)|deformation]] to yield a three-dimensional structure comprising a random network of [[Face_(geometry)#Ridge_or_.28n-2.29-face|ridge]]s and [[facet]]s with variable density. The geometry of crumpled structures is the subject of some interest the mathematical community within the discipline of topology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last1=Cerda | first1=Enrique | last2=Chaieb |first2=Sahraoui |last3=Melo | first3=Francisco| last4=Mahadevan| first4=L |title=Conical dislocations in crumpling | journal= nature | year= 1999| volume=401| doi=10.1038/43395| bibcode=1999Natur.401...46C}}&lt;/ref&gt; Crumpled paper balls have been studied and found to exhibit surprisingly complex structures with [[compressive strength]] resulting from [[friction]]al interactions at [[Local property|locally]] flat facets between folds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Cambou| first1=Anne Dominique |last2=Narayanan | first2=Menon| title=Three-dimensional structure of a sheet crumpled into a ball.| journal= Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences |year=2011 | volume=108 |issue=36 |pages=14741–14745|arxiv=1203.5826|bibcode=2011PNAS..10814741C|doi=10.1073/pnas.1019192108|pmc=3169141}}&lt;/ref&gt; The unusually high compressive strength of crumpled structures relative to their density is of interest in the disciplines of [[materials science]] and [[mechanical engineering]].

== Significance of crumpling ==

The packing of a sheet by crumpling is a complex phenomenon that depends on material parameters and the packing protocol. Thus the crumpling behaviour of foil, paper and poly-membranes differs significantly and can be interpreted on the basis of material foldability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Habibi| first1=M |last2=Bonn | first2=D| title=Effect of the material properties on the crumpling of a thin sheet.| journal= Soft matter |year=2017 | volume=3 |pages=4029}}&lt;/ref&gt; The high compressive strength exhibited by dense crumple formed [[cellulose]] paper is of interest towards impact dissipation applications and has  been proposed as an approach to [[Paper recycling|utilising waste paper]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| title=Mechanical properties in crumple-formed paper derived materials subjected to compression| journal= Heilyon |year=2017 | volume=3 |issue=6| pages=e00329 | url= http://www.heliyon.com/article/e00329/}} &lt;/ref&gt;

{{Transformation rules}}

In [[propositional calculus|propositional logic]] and [[boolean algebra]], '''De Morgan's laws'''&lt;ref&gt;Copi and Cohen{{Full citation needed|date=January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first=Patrick J.|last=Hurley|title=A Concise Introduction to Logic|edition=12th|publisher=Cengage Learning|year=2015|isbn=978-1-285-19654-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Moore and Parker{{Full citation needed|date=January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; are a pair of transformation rules that are both [[Validity (logic)|valid]] [[rule of inference|rules of inference]]. They are named after [[Augustus De Morgan]], a 19th-century British mathematician. The rules allow the expression of [[Logical conjunction|conjunctions]] and [[Logical disjunction|disjunctions]] purely in terms of each other via [[logical negation|negation]].

The rules can be expressed in English as:
:the negation of a disjunction is the conjunction of the negations; and
:the negation of a conjunction is the disjunction of the negations;
or
:the [[Complement (set theory)|complement]] of the union of two sets is the same as the intersection of their complements; and
:the complement of the intersection of two sets is the same as the union of their complements.
or
:not (A or B) = not A and not B; and
:not (A and B) = not A or not B

In [[Set theory|set theory]] and [[Boolean algebra (logic)|Boolean algebra]], these are written formally as
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  \overline{A \cup B} &amp;= \overline{A} \cap \overline{B}, \\
  \overline{A \cap B} &amp;= \overline{A} \cup \overline{B},
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
where
* ''A'' and ''B'' are sets,
* {{overline|''A''}} is the complement of A,
* ∩ is the [[Intersection (set theory)|intersection]], and
* ∪ is the [[Union (set theory)|union]].

In [[formal language]], the rules are written as
:&lt;math&gt;\neg(P\lor Q)\iff(\neg P)\land(\neg Q),&lt;/math&gt;
and
:&lt;math&gt;\neg(P\land Q)\iff(\neg P)\lor(\neg Q)&lt;/math&gt;
where
* ''P'' and ''Q are propositions,''
* [[Negation|&lt;math&gt;\neg&lt;/math&gt;]] is the negation logic operator (NOT),
* [[Logical_conjunction|&lt;math&gt;\land&lt;/math&gt;]] is the conjunction logic operator (AND),
* [[Logical_disjunction|&lt;math&gt;\lor&lt;/math&gt;]] is the disjunction logic operator (OR),
* [[If_and_only_if|&lt;math&gt;\iff&lt;/math&gt;]] is a [[metalogic]]al symbol meaning "can be replaced in a [[formal proof|logical proof]] with".

Applications of the rules include simplification of logical [[Expression (computer science)|expressions]] in [[computer program]]s and digital circuit designs. De Morgan's laws are an example of a more general concept of [[duality (mathematics)|mathematical duality]].

==Formal notation==
The ''negation of conjunction'' rule may be written in [[sequent]] notation:
:&lt;math&gt;\neg(P \land Q) \vdash (\neg P \lor \neg Q).&lt;/math&gt;

The ''negation of disjunction'' rule may be written as:
:&lt;math&gt;\neg(P \lor Q) \vdash (\neg P \land \neg Q).&lt;/math&gt;

In [[Rule of inference|rule form]]: ''negation of conjunction''
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\neg (P \land Q)}{\therefore \neg P \lor \neg Q}&lt;/math&gt;

and ''negation of disjunction''
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\neg (P \lor Q)}{\therefore \neg P \land \neg Q}&lt;/math&gt;

and expressed as a truth-functional [[Tautology (logic)|tautology]] or [[theorem]] of propositional logic:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  \neg (P \land Q) &amp;\to (\neg P \lor \neg Q), \\
   \neg (P \lor Q) &amp;\to (\neg P \land \neg Q),
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt; are propositions expressed in some formal system.

===Substitution form===
De Morgan's laws are normally shown in the compact form above, with negation of the output on the left and negation of the inputs on the right. A clearer form for substitution can be stated as:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  (P \land Q) &amp;\equiv \neg (\neg P \lor \neg Q), \\
   (P \lor Q) &amp;\equiv \neg (\neg P \land \neg Q).
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

This emphasizes the need to invert both the inputs and the output, as well as change the operator, when doing a substitution.

===Set theory and Boolean algebra===
In set theory and [[Boolean algebra (logic)|Boolean algebra]], it is often stated as "union and intersection interchange under complementation",&lt;ref&gt;''Boolean Algebra'' by R. L. Goodstein. {{ISBN|0-486-45894-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; which can be formally expressed as:
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  \overline{A \cup B} &amp;= \overline{A} \cap \overline{B}, \\
  \overline{A \cap B} &amp;= \overline{A} \cup \overline{B},
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

where:
* {{overline|''A''}} is the negation of A, the [[overline]] being written above the terms to be negated,
* ∩ is the [[Intersection (set theory)|intersection]] operator (AND),
* ∪ is the [[Union (set theory)|union]] operator (OR).

The generalized form is:
: &lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  \overline{\bigcap_{i \in I} A_{i}} &amp;\equiv \bigcup_{i \in I} \overline{A_{i}}, \\
  \overline{\bigcup_{i \in I} A_{i}} &amp;\equiv \bigcap_{i \in I} \overline{A_{i}},
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|''I''}} is some, possibly uncountable, indexing set.

In set notation, De Morgan's laws can be remembered using the [[mnemonic]] "break the line, change the sign".&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=NdAjEDP5mDsC&amp;pg=PA81&amp;lpg=PA81&amp;dq=break+the+line+change+the+sign&amp;source=web&amp;ots=BtUl4oQOja&amp;sig=H1Wz9e6Uv_bNeSbTvN6lr3s47PQ#PPA81,M1 ''2000 Solved Problems in Digital Electronics''] by S. P. Bali&lt;/ref&gt;

===Engineering===
In [[electrical and computer engineering]], De Morgan's laws are commonly written as:
: &lt;math&gt;\overline{A \cdot B} \equiv \overline {A} + \overline {B}&lt;/math&gt;

and
: &lt;math&gt;\overline{A + B} \equiv \overline {A} \cdot \overline {B},&lt;/math&gt;

where:
* &lt;math&gt; \cdot &lt;/math&gt; is a logical AND,
* &lt;math&gt;+&lt;/math&gt; is a logical OR,
* the {{overline|overbar}} is the logical NOT of what is underneath the overbar.

===Text searching===
De Morgan’s laws commonly apply to text searching using Boolean operators AND, OR, and NOT.  Consider a set of documents containing the words “cars” and “trucks”. De Morgan’s laws hold that these two searches will return the same set of documents:

:Search A: NOT (cars OR trucks)
:Search B: (NOT cars) AND (NOT trucks)

The corpus of documents containing “cars” or “trucks” can be represented by four documents:
:Document 1: Contains only the word “cars”.
:Document 2: Contains only “trucks”.
:Document 3: Contains both “cars” and “trucks”.
:Document 4: Contains neither “cars” nor “trucks”.

To evaluate Search A, clearly the search “(cars OR trucks)” will hit on Documents 1, 2, and 3. So the negation of that search (which is Search A) will hit everything else, which is Document 4.

Evaluating Search B, the search “(NOT cars)” will hit on documents that do not contain “cars”, which is Documents 2 and 4.  Similarly the search “(NOT trucks)” will hit on Documents 1 and 4. Applying the AND operator to these two searches (which is Search B) will hit on the documents that are common to these two searches, which is Document 4.

A similar evaluation can be applied to show that the following two searches will return the same set of documents (Documents 1, 2, 4):
:Search C: NOT (cars AND trucks),
:Search D: (NOT cars) OR (NOT trucks).

==History==
The laws are named after [[Augustus De Morgan]] (1806–1871),&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.mtsu.edu/~phys2020/Lectures/L19-L25/L3/DeMorgan/body_demorgan.html DeMorgan’s Theorems]'' at mtsu.edu&lt;/ref&gt; who introduced a formal version of the laws to classical [[propositional logic]]. De Morgan's formulation was influenced by algebraization of logic undertaken by [[George Boole]], which later cemented De Morgan's claim to the find. Nevertheless, a similar observation was made by [[Aristotle]], and was known to Greek and Medieval logicians.&lt;ref&gt;Bocheński's ''History of Formal Logic''&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in the 14th century, [[William of Ockham]] wrote down the words that would result by reading the laws out.&lt;ref&gt;William of Ockham, ''Summa Logicae'', part II, sections 32 and 33.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jean Buridan]], in his ''Summulae de Dialectica'', also describes rules of conversion that follow the lines of De Morgan's laws.&lt;ref&gt;Jean Buridan, ''Summula de Dialectica''. Trans. Gyula Klima. New Haven: Yale University Press, 2001. See especially Treatise 1, Chapter 7, Section 5. {{ISBN|0-300-08425-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Still, De Morgan is given credit for stating the laws in the terms of modern formal logic, and incorporating them into the language of logic. De Morgan's laws can be proved easily, and may even seem trivial.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.engr.iupui.edu/~orr/webpages/cpt120/mathbios/ademo.htm Augustus De Morgan (1806–1871)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100715185655/http://www.engr.iupui.edu/~orr/webpages/cpt120/mathbios/ademo.htm |date=2010-07-15 }} by Robert H. Orr&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, these laws are helpful in making valid inferences in proofs and deductive arguments.

==Informal proof==
De Morgan's theorem may be applied to the negation of a [[disjunction]] or the negation of a [[Logical conjunction|conjunction]] in all or part of a formula.

===Negation of a disjunction===
In the case of its application to a disjunction, consider the following claim: "it is false that either of A or B is true", which is written as:
:&lt;math&gt;\neg(A\lor B).&lt;/math&gt;
In that it has been established that ''neither'' A nor B is true, then it must follow that both A is not true [[logical AND|and]] B is not true, which may be written directly as:
:&lt;math&gt;(\neg A)\wedge(\neg B).&lt;/math&gt;
If either A or B ''were'' true, then the disjunction of A and B would be true, making its negation false. Presented in English, this follows the logic that "since two things are both false, it is also false that either of them is true".

Working in the opposite direction, the second expression asserts that A is false and B is false (or equivalently that "not A" and "not B" are true). Knowing this, a disjunction of A and B must be false also. The negation of said disjunction must thus be true, and the result is identical to the first claim.

===Negation of a conjunction===
The application of De Morgan's theorem to a conjunction is very similar to its application to a disjunction both in form and rationale.  Consider the following claim: "it is false that A and B are both true", which is written as:
:&lt;math&gt;\neg(A\land B).&lt;/math&gt;
In order for this claim to be true, either or both of A or B must be false, for if they both were true, then the conjunction of A and B would be true, making its negation false. Thus, [[inclusive or|one (at least) or more]] of A and B must be false (or equivalently, one or more of "not A" and "not B" must be true). This may be written directly as,
:&lt;math&gt;(\neg A)\lor(\neg B).&lt;/math&gt;
Presented in English, this follows the logic that "since it is false that two things are both true, at least one of them must be false".

Working in the opposite direction again, the second expression asserts that at least one of "not A" and "not B" must be true, or equivalently that at least one of A and B must be false. Since at least one of them must be false, then their conjunction would likewise be false. Negating said conjunction thus results in a true expression, and this expression is identical to the first claim.

==Formal proof==
The proof that &lt;math&gt;(A\cap B)^\complement = A^\complement \cup B^\complement&lt;/math&gt; is completed in 2 steps by proving both &lt;math&gt;(A\cap B)^\complement \subseteq A^\complement \cup B^\complement&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;A^\complement \cup B^\complement \subseteq (A\cap B)^\complement&lt;/math&gt;.

===Part 1===

Let &lt;math&gt;x \in (A \cap B)^\complement&lt;/math&gt;. Then, &lt;math&gt;x \not\in A \cap B&lt;/math&gt;.

Because &lt;math&gt;A \cap B = \{y | y \in A \land y \in B\}&lt;/math&gt;, it must be the case that &lt;math&gt;x \not\in A&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;x \not\in B&lt;/math&gt;.

If &lt;math&gt;x \not\in A&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;x \in A^\complement&lt;/math&gt;, so &lt;math&gt;x \in A^\complement \cup B^\complement&lt;/math&gt;.

Similarly, if &lt;math&gt;x \not\in B&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;x \in B^\complement&lt;/math&gt;, so &lt;math&gt;x \in A^\complement\cup B^\complement&lt;/math&gt;.

Thus, &lt;math&gt;\forall x( x \in (A\cap B)^\complement \rarr x \in A^\complement \cup B^\complement)&lt;/math&gt;;

that is, &lt;math&gt;(A\cap B)^\complement \subseteq A^\complement \cup B^\complement&lt;/math&gt;.

===Part 2===

To prove the reverse direction, let &lt;math&gt;x \in A^\complement \cup B^\complement&lt;/math&gt;, and assume &lt;math&gt;x \not\in (A\cap B)^\complement&lt;/math&gt;.

Under that assumption, it must be the case that &lt;math&gt;x \in A\cap B&lt;/math&gt;,

so it follows that &lt;math&gt;x \in A&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;x \in B&lt;/math&gt;, and thus &lt;math&gt;x \not\in A^\complement&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;x \not\in B^\complement&lt;/math&gt;.

However, that means &lt;math&gt;x \not\in A^\complement \cup B^\complement&lt;/math&gt;, in contradiction to the hypothesis that &lt;math&gt;x \in A^\complement \cup B^\complement&lt;/math&gt;,

therefore, the assumption &lt;math&gt;x \not\in (A\cap B)^\complement&lt;/math&gt; must not be the case, meaning that &lt;math&gt;x \in (A\cap B)^\complement&lt;/math&gt;.

Hence, &lt;math&gt;\forall x( x \in A^\complement \cup B^\complement \rarr x \in (A\cap B)^\complement)&lt;/math&gt;,

that is, &lt;math&gt;A^\complement \cup B^\complement \subseteq (A\cap B)^\complement&lt;/math&gt;.

===Conclusion===

If &lt;math&gt;A^\complement \cup B^\complement \subseteq (A\cap B)^\complement&lt;/math&gt; ''and'' &lt;math&gt;(A \cap B)^\complement \subseteq A^\complement \cup B^\complement&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;(A\cap B)^\complement = A^\complement \cup B^\complement&lt;/math&gt;; this concludes the proof of De Morgan's law.

The other De Morgan's law, &lt;math&gt;(A \cup B)^\complement = A^\complement \cap B^\complement&lt;/math&gt;, is proven similarly.

==Generalising De Morgan duality==
[[File:DeMorgan Logic Circuit diagram DIN.svg|thumb|De Morgan's Laws represented as a circuit with logic gates]]

In extensions of classical propositional logic, the duality still holds (that is, to any logical operator one can always find its dual), since in the presence of the identities governing negation, one may always introduce an operator that is the De Morgan dual of another. This leads to an important property of logics based on [[classical logic]], namely the existence of [[negation normal form]]s: any formula is equivalent to another formula where negations only occur applied to the non-logical atoms of the formula. The existence of negation normal forms drives many applications, for example in [[digital circuit]] design, where it is used to manipulate the types of [[logic gate]]s, and in formal logic, where it is needed to find the [[conjunctive normal form]] and [[disjunctive normal form]] of a formula.  Computer programmers use them to simplify or properly negate complicated [[Conditional (programming)|logical conditions]]. They are also often useful in computations in elementary [[probability theory]].

Let one define the dual of any propositional operator P(''p'', ''q'', ...) depending on elementary propositions ''p'', ''q'', ... to be the operator &lt;math&gt;\mbox{P}^d&lt;/math&gt; defined by

:&lt;math&gt;\mbox{P}^d(p, q, ...) = \neg P(\neg p, \neg q, \dots).&lt;/math&gt;

==Extension to predicate and modal logic==

This duality can be generalised to quantifiers, so for example the [[universal quantifier]] and [[existential quantifier]] are duals:

:&lt;math&gt; \forall x \, P(x) \equiv \neg [ \exists x \, \neg P(x)] &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \exists x \, P(x) \equiv \neg [ \forall x \, \neg P(x)] &lt;/math&gt;

To relate these quantifier dualities to the De Morgan laws, set up a [[model theory|model]] with some small number of elements in its domain ''D'', such as

:''D'' = {''a'', ''b'', ''c''}.

Then

:&lt;math&gt; \forall x \, P(x) \equiv P(a) \land P(b) \land P(c) &lt;/math&gt;

and

:&lt;math&gt; \exists x \, P(x) \equiv P(a) \lor P(b) \lor P(c).&lt;/math&gt;

But, using De Morgan's laws,

:&lt;math&gt; P(a) \land P(b) \land P(c) \equiv \neg (\neg P(a) \lor \neg P(b) \lor \neg P(c)) &lt;/math&gt;

and

:&lt;math&gt; P(a) \lor P(b) \lor P(c) \equiv \neg (\neg P(a) \land \neg P(b) \land \neg P(c)), &lt;/math&gt;

verifying the quantifier dualities in the model.

Then, the quantifier dualities can be extended further to [[modal logic]], relating the box ("necessarily") and diamond ("possibly") operators:

:&lt;math&gt; \Box p \equiv \neg \Diamond \neg p, &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; \Diamond p \equiv \neg \Box \neg p.&lt;/math&gt;

In its application to the [[alethic modalities]] of possibility and necessity, [[Aristotle]] observed this case, and in the case of [[normal modal logic]], the relationship of these modal operators to the quantification can be understood by setting up models using [[Kripke semantics]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4867">{{short description|mathematical notion of infinitesimal difference}}
In [[mathematics]], '''differential''' refers to [[infinitesimal]] differences or to the [[derivative]]s of functions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/us/definition/american_english/differential|title=differential - Definition of differential in US English by Oxford Dictionaries|author=|date=|website=Oxford Dictionaries - English|accessdate=13 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term is used in various branches of mathematics such as [[calculus]], [[differential geometry]], [[algebraic geometry]] and [[algebraic topology]].

==Basic notions==
* In [[calculus]], the [[differential of a function|differential]] represents a change in the [[linearization]] of a [[function (mathematics)|function]].
** The [[total differential]] is its generalization for functions of multiple variables.
* In traditional approaches to calculus, the [[differential (infinitesimal)|differentials]] (e.g. ''dx'', ''dy'', ''dt'', etc.) are interpreted as [[infinitesimal]]s.  There are several methods of defining infinitesimals rigorously, but it is sufficient to say that an infinitesimal number is smaller in absolute value than any positive real number, just as an infinitely large number is larger than any real number.
* The [[Total derivative|differential]] is another name for the [[Jacobian matrix]] of [[partial derivative]]s of a function from '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; to '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''m''&lt;/sup&gt; (especially when this [[Matrix (mathematics)|matrix]] is viewed as a [[linear map]]).
* More generally, the [[Pushforward (differential)|differential]] or ''[[Pushforward (differential)|pushforward]]'' refers to the derivative of a map between [[smooth manifold]]s and the pushforward operations it defines. The differential is also used to define the dual concept of [[pullback (differential geometry)|pullback]].
* [[Stochastic calculus]] provides a notion of [[stochastic differential]] and an associated calculus for [[stochastic process]]es.
* The [[integrator]] in a [[Stieltjes integral]] is represented as the differential of a function.  Formally, the differential appearing under the integral behaves exactly as a differential: thus, the [[integration by substitution]] and [[integration by parts]] formulae for Stieltjes integral correspond, respectively, to the [[chain rule]] and [[product rule]] for the differential.

==Differential geometry==
The notion of a differential motivates several concepts in [[differential geometry]] (and [[differential topology]]).
*The [[Pushforward (differential)|differential (Pushforward)]] of a map between manifolds.
*[[Differential form]]s provide a framework which accommodates multiplication and differentiation of differentials.
*The [[exterior derivative]] is a notion of differentiation of differential forms which generalizes the [[Total derivative|differential]] of a function (which is a [[differential 1-form]]).
*[[Pullback (differential geometry)|Pullback]] is, in particular, a geometric name for the [[chain rule]] for composing a map between manifolds with a differential form on the target manifold.
*[[Covariant derivative|Covariant derivatives or differentials]] provide a general notion for differentiating of [[vector field]]s and [[tensor field]]s on a manifold, or, more generally, sections of a [[vector bundle]]: see [[Connection (vector bundle)]]. This ultimately leads to the general concept of a [[Connection (mathematics)|connection]].

==Algebraic geometry==
Differentials are also important in [[algebraic geometry]], and there are several important notions.
* [[Abelian differential]]s usually refer to differential one-forms on an [[algebraic curve]] or [[Riemann surface]].
* [[Quadratic differential]]s (which behave like "squares" of abelian differentials) are also important in the theory of Riemann surfaces.
* [[Kähler differential]]s provide a general notion of differential in algebraic geometry.

==Other meanings==
The term ''differential'' has also been adopted in homological algebra and algebraic topology, because of the role the exterior derivative plays in de Rham cohomology: in a [[cochain complex]] &lt;math&gt;(C_\bullet, d_\bullet)&lt;/math&gt;, the maps (or ''coboundary operators'') ''d&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' are often called differentials. Dually, the boundary operators in a chain complex are sometimes called ''codifferentials''.

The properties of the differential also motivate the algebraic notions of a ''[[derivation (abstract algebra)|derivation]]'' and a ''[[differential algebra]]''.

==Life==
Cowley was born on May 22, 1874, in [[Allegheny, Pennsylvania]].&lt;ref name="asc"&gt;{{citation|url=https://www.agnesscott.edu/lriddle/women/cowley.htm|title=Elizabeth Buchanan Cowley|work=Biographies of Women Mathematicians|first=Larry|last=Riddle|publisher=[[Agnes Scott College]]|date=January 10, 2014|accessdate=2015-10-08}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[:File:Woman s Who s who of America.pdf]], 1914, p. 210 (= p. 199 in Pdf)&lt;/ref&gt; She had four siblings, but they and her father all died by 1900.&lt;ref name="gl"/&gt; Cowley's mother, Mary Junkin Buchanan Cowley, later became a member of the Board of Public Education of [[Pittsburgh]], and was the namesake of the Mary J. Cowley School in Pittsburgh. Cowley's grandfather (Mary Cowley's father) was James Galloway Buchanan, a surgeon in the [[Union Army]].&lt;ref name="thornton"&gt;{{citation|title=History of Pittsburgh and Environs, from Prehistoric Days to the Beginning of the American Revolution|volume=4|first=George Thornton|last=Fleming|publisher=American Historical Society, Incorporated|year=1922|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1M8wAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA107|pages=107–108}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Cowley earned a bachelor's degree in 1893 from the [[Indiana University of Pennsylvania|Indiana State Normal School of Pennsylvania]], and became a school teacher. She earned a second bachelor's degree in 1901 and a master's degree in 1902 from [[Vassar College]], and became an instructor at Vassar, studying higher mathematics during the summers at the [[University of Chicago]].&lt;ref name="asc"/&gt;&lt;ref name="gl"/&gt; In 1908 she completed a doctorate from [[Columbia University]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="26469">In mathematics, '''equivalent definitions''' are used in two somewhat different ways. First, within a particular mathematical theory (for example, [[Euclidean geometry]]), a notion (for example, [[Ellipse#Definition|ellipse]] or [[Minimal surface#Definitions|minimal surface]]) may have more than one definition. These definitions are equivalent in the context of a given [[mathematical structure]] ([[Euclidean space]], in this case). Second, a mathematical structure may have more than one definition (for example, [[topological space]] has at least [[Characterizations of the category of topological spaces|seven definitions]]; [[ordered field]] has at least [[Ordered field#Definition|two definitions]]).

In the former case, equivalence of two definitions means that a mathematical object (for example, geometric body) satisfies one definition [[if and only if]] it satisfies the other definition.

In the latter case, the meaning of equivalence (between two definitions of a structure) is more complicated, since a structure is more abstract than an object. Many different objects may implement the same structure.

==Isomorphic implementations==

[[Natural number#Formal definitions|Natural numbers]] may be implemented as 0 = {{mset|&amp;nbsp;}}, 1 = {{mset|0}} = {{mset|{{mset|&amp;nbsp;}}}}, 2 = {{mset|0, 1}} = {{mset|{{mset|&amp;nbsp;}}, {{mset|{{mset|&amp;nbsp;}}}}}}, 3 = {{mset|0, 1, 2}} = {{mset|{{mset|&amp;nbsp;}}, {{mset|{{mset|&amp;nbsp;}}}}, {{mset|{{mset|&amp;nbsp;}}, {{mset|{{mset|&amp;nbsp;}}}}}}}} and so on; or alternatively as 0 = {{mset|&amp;nbsp;}}, 1 = {{mset|0}} ={{mset|{{mset|&amp;nbsp;}}}}, 2 = {{mset|1}} = {{mset|{{mset|{{mset|&amp;nbsp;}}}}}} and so on. These are two different but [[Isomorphism|isomorphic]] implementations of natural numbers in set theory.
They are isomorphic as models of [[Peano axioms#Models|Peano axioms]], that is, triples (''N'',0,''S'') where ''N'' is a set, 0 an element of ''N'', and ''S'' (called the [[successor function]]) a map of ''N'' to itself (satisfying appropriate conditions). In the first implementation ''S''(''n'') = ''n'' ∪ {{mset|''n''}}; in the second implementation ''S''(''n'') = {{mset|''n''}}. As emphasized in [[Benacerraf's identification problem]], the two implementations differ in their answer to the question whether 0 ∈ 2; however, this is not a legitimate question about natural numbers (since the relation ∈ is not stipulated by the relevant signature(s), see the next section).&lt;ref group="details"&gt;Technically, "0 ∈ 2" is an example of a non-transportable relation, see {{harvnb|Bourbaki|1968|loc=Sect.IV.1.3}}, {{harvnb|Marshall|Chuaqui|1991}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, different but isomorphic implementations are used for [[Complex number#Formal construction|complex numbers]].

==Deduced structures and cryptomorphisms==

The successor function ''S'' on natural numbers leads to [[Peano axioms#Arithmetic|arithmetic operations]], addition and multiplication, and the total order, thus endowing ''N'' with an [[Peano axioms#Equivalent axiomatizations|ordered semiring]] structure. This is an example of a deduced structure. The ordered semiring structure (''N'', +, ·, ≤) is deduced from the Peano structure (''N'', 0, ''S'') by the following procedure:
''n'' + 0 = ''n'', &amp;nbsp; ''m'' + S (''n'') = S (''m'' + ''n''), &amp;nbsp; ''m'' · 0 = 0, &amp;nbsp; ''m'' · S (''n'') = ''m'' + (''m'' · ''n''), and ''m'' ≤ ''n'' if and only if there exists ''k'' ∈ ''N'' such that ''m'' + ''k'' = ''n''. And conversely, the Peano structure is deduced from the ordered semiring structure as follows: ''S'' (''n'') = ''n'' + 1, and 0 is defined by 0 + 0 = 0. It means that the two structures on ''N'' are equivalent by means of the two procedures.

The two isomorphic implementations of natural numbers, mentioned in the previous section, are isomorphic as triples (''N'',0,''S''), that is, structures of the same [[Signature (logic)|signature]] (0,''S'') consisting of a constant symbol 0 and a unary function ''S''. An ordered semiring structure (''N'', +, ·, ≤) has another signature (+, ·, ≤) consisting of two binary functions and one binary relation. The notion of isomorphism does not apply to structures of different signatures. In particular, a Peano structure cannot be isomorphic to an ordered semiring. However, an ordered semiring deduced from a Peano structure may be isomorphic to another ordered semiring. Such relation between structures of different signatures is sometimes called a [[cryptomorphism]].

==Ambient frameworks==

A structure may be implemented within a set theory [[Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory|ZFC]], or another set theory such as [[Von Neumann–Bernays–Gödel set theory|NBG]], [[New Foundations|NFU]], [[Elementary theory of the category of sets|ETCS]].&lt;ref&gt;About ETCS see [[Type theory#Mathematical foundations]]&lt;/ref&gt; Alternatively, a structure may be treated in the framework of [[first-order logic]], [[second-order logic]], [[higher-order logic]], a [[type theory]], [[homotopy type theory]] etc.&lt;ref group="details"&gt;A reasonable choice of an ambient framework should not alter basic properties of a structure, but can alter provability of finer properties. For example, some theorems about the natural numbers are provable in set theory (and some other strong systems) but not provable in first-order logic; see [[Paris–Harrington theorem]] and [[Goodstein's theorem]]. The same applies to definability; see for example [[Tarski's undefinability theorem]].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structures according to Bourbaki==

:"Mathematics [...] cannot be explained completely by a single concept such as the mathematical structure. Nevertheless, Bourbaki's structuralist approach is the best that we have." ({{harvnb|Pudlák|2013|loc=page 3}})

:"Evident as the notion of mathematical structure may seem these days, it was at least not made explicit until the middle of the 20th century. Then it was the influence of the Bourbaki-project and then later the development of category theory which made the notion explicit" ([http://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/structure#related_entries nLab]).

According to [[Nicolas Bourbaki|Bourbaki]], the scale of sets on a given set ''X'' consists of all sets arising from ''X'' by taking [[Cartesian product]]s and [[power set]]s, in any combination, a finite number of times. Examples: ''X''; ''X'' × ''X''; ''P''(''X''); ''P''(''P''(''X'' × ''X'') × ''X'' × ''P''(''P''(''X''))) × ''X''. (Here ''A'' × ''B'' is the product of ''A'' and ''B'', and ''P''(''A'') is the powerset of ''A''.) In particular, a pair (0,''S'') consisting of an element 0 ∈ ''N'' and a unary function ''S'' : ''N'' → ''N'' belongs to ''N'' × ''P''(''N'' × ''N'') (since [[Function (mathematics)#Definition|a function is a subset of the Cartesian product]]). A triple (+, ·, ≤) consisting of two binary functions ''N'' × ''N'' → ''N'' and one binary relation on ''N'' belongs to ''P''(''N'' × ''N'' × ''N'')  × ''P''(''N'' × ''N'' × ''N'')  × ''P''(''N'' × ''N''). Similarly, every algebraic structure on a set belongs to the corresponding set in the scale of sets on ''X''.

Non-algebraic structures on a set ''X'' often involve sets of subsets of ''X'' (that is, subsets of ''P''(''X''), in other words, elements of ''P''(''P''(''X''))). For example, the structure of a [[topological space]], called a topology on ''X'', treated as [[Topological space#Open sets definition|the set of "open" sets]]; or the structure of a measurable space, treated as the [[Sigma-algebra|σ-algebra]] of "measurable" sets; both are elements of ''P''(''P''(''X'')). These are second-order structures.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pudlák|2013|loc=pages 10–11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

More complicated non-algebraic structures combine an algebraic component and a non-algebraic component. For example, the structure of a [[topological group]] consists of a topology and the structure of a group. Thus it belongs to the product of ''P''(''P''(''X'')) and another ("algebraic") set in the scale; this product is again a set in the scale.

===Transport of structures; isomorphism===

{{main article|Transport of structure}}

Given two sets ''X'', ''Y'' and a [[bijection]] ''f'' : ''X'' → ''Y'', one constructs the corresponding bijections between scale sets. Namely, the bijection ''X'' × ''X'' → ''Y'' × ''Y'' sends (''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) to (''f''(''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;),''f''(''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)); the bijection ''P''(''X'') → ''P''(''Y'') sends a subset ''A'' of ''X'' into its [[Image (mathematics)|image]] ''f''(''A'') in ''Y''; and so on, recursively: a scale set being either product of scale sets or power set of a scale set, one of the two constructions applies.

Let (''X'',''U'') and (''Y'',''V'') be two structures of the same signature. Then ''U'' belongs to a scale set ''S''&lt;sub&gt;''X''&lt;/sub&gt;, and ''V'' belongs to the corresponding scale set ''S''&lt;sub&gt;''Y''&lt;/sub&gt;. Using the bijection ''F'' : ''S''&lt;sub&gt;''X''&lt;/sub&gt; → ''S''&lt;sub&gt;''Y''&lt;/sub&gt; constructed from a bijection ''f'' : ''X'' → ''Y'', one defines:
: ''f'' is an ''isomorphism'' between (''X'',''U'') and (''Y'',''V'') if ''F''(''U'') = ''V''.
This general notion of isomorphism generalizes many less general notions listed below.

In fact, Bourbaki stipulates two additional features. First, several sets ''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; (so-called principal base sets) may be used, rather than a single set ''X''. However, this feature is of little use. All the items listed above use a single principal base set. Second, so-called auxiliary base sets ''E''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''E''&lt;sub&gt;''m''&lt;/sub&gt; may be used. This feature is widely used. Indeed, the structure of a vector space stipulates not only addition ''X'' × ''X'' → ''X'' but also scalar multiplication '''R''' × ''X'' → ''X'' (if '''R''' is the field of scalars). Thus, '''R''' is an auxiliary base set (called also "external"&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pudlák|2013|loc=page 12}}&lt;/ref&gt;). The scale of sets consists of all sets arising from all base sets (both principal and auxiliary) by taking Cartesian products and power sets. Still, the map ''f'' (possibly an isomorphism) acts on ''X'' only; auxiliary sets are endowed by identity maps. (However, the case of ''n'' principal sets leads to ''n'' maps.)

===Functoriality===

Several statements formulated by Bourbaki without mentioning categories can be reformulated readily in the language of [[category theory]]. First, some terminology. 
* The scale of sets is indexed by "echelon construction schemes",&lt;ref name="B-IV.1.1"&gt;{{harvnb|Bourbaki|1968|loc=Sect.IV.1.1}}&lt;/ref&gt; called also "types".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pudlák|2013|loc=page 10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Marshall|Chuaqui|1991|loc=§2}}&lt;/ref&gt; One may think of, say, the set ''P''(''P''(''X'' × ''X'') × ''X'' × ''P''(''P''(''X''))) × ''X'' as a set ''X'' substituted into the formula "''P''(''P''(''a'' × ''a'') × ''a'' × ''P''(''P''(''a''))) × ''a''" for the variable ''a''; this formula is the corresponding echelon construction scheme.&lt;ref group="details"&gt;In order to be more formal, Bourbaki encodes such formulas with sequences of ordered pairs of natural numbers.&lt;/ref&gt; (This notion, defined for all structures, may be thought of as a generalization of the signature defined only for algebraic structures.)&lt;ref group="details"&gt;On one hand, it is possible to exclude the Cartesian products, treating a pair (''x'',''y'') as just the set {{''x''},{''x'',''y''}}. On the other hand, it is possible to include the set operation ''X'',''Y''-&gt;''Y''&lt;sup&gt;''X''&lt;/sup&gt; (all functions from ''X'' to ''Y''). "It is possible to simplify the matter by considering operations and functions as a special kind of relations (for example, a binary operation is a ternary relation). However, quite often, it is an advantage to have operations as a primitive concept."  {{harvnb|Pudlák|2013|loc=page 17}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Let '''Set*''' denote the [[groupoid]] of sets and bijections. That is, the category whose objects are (all) sets, and morphisms are (all) bijections.

''Proposition.'' &lt;ref name="B-IV.1.2"&gt;{{harvnb|Bourbaki|1968|loc=Sect.IV.1.2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each echelon construction scheme leads to a functor from '''Set*''' to itself.

In particular, the [[permutation group]] of a set ''X'' [[Group action|acts]] on every scale set ''S''&lt;sub&gt;''X''&lt;/sub&gt;.

In order to formulate one more proposition, the notion "species of structures" is needed, since echelon construction scheme gives only preliminary information on a structure. For example, commutative groups and (arbitrary) groups are two different species of the same echelon construction scheme. Another example: topological spaces and measurable spaces. They differ in the so-called axiom of the species. This axiom is the conjunction of all required properties, such as "multiplication is associative" for groups, or "the union of open sets is an open set" for topological spaces.
* A species of structures consists of an echelon construction scheme and an axiom of the species.

''Proposition.'' &lt;ref name="B-IV.1.5"&gt;{{harvnb|Bourbaki|1968|loc=Sect.IV.1.5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each species of structures leads to a functor from '''Set*''' to itself.

Example. For the species of groups, the functor ''F'' maps a set ''X'' to the set ''F''(''X'') of all group structures on ''X''. For the species of topological spaces, the functor ''F'' maps a set ''X'' to the set ''F''(''X'') of all topologies on ''X''. The morphism ''F''(''f'') : ''F''(''X'') → ''F''(''Y'') corresponding to a bijection ''f'' : ''X'' → ''Y'' is the transport of structures. Topologies on ''Y'' correspond bijectively to topologies on ''X''. The same holds for group structures, etc.

In particular, the set of all structures of a given species on a given set is invariant under the action of the permutation group on the corresponding scale set ''S''&lt;sub&gt;''X''&lt;/sub&gt;, and is a [[Fixed point (mathematics)|fixed point]] of the action of the group on another scale set ''P''(''S''&lt;sub&gt;''X''&lt;/sub&gt;). However, not all fixed points of this action correspond to species of structures.&lt;ref group="details"&gt;The set of all possible axioms of species is [[Countable set|countable]], while the set of all fixed points of the considered action may be uncountable. Tarski's "[[Alfred Tarski#What are logical notions?|logical notions of higher order]]" are closer to the fixed points than to species of structures, see {{harvnb|Feferman|2010}} and references therefrom.&lt;/ref&gt;

Given two species, Bourbaki defines the notion "procedure of deduction" (of a structure of the second species from a structure of the first species).&lt;ref name="B-IV.1.6"&gt;{{harvnb|Bourbaki|1968|loc=Sect.IV.1.6}}&lt;/ref&gt; A pair of mutually inverse procedures of deduction leads to the notion "equivalent species".&lt;ref name="B-IV.1.7"&gt;{{harvnb|Bourbaki|1968|loc=Sect.IV.1.7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Example. The structure of a topological space may be defined as an [[Topological space#Open sets definition|open set topology]] or alternatively, a [[Topological space#Closed sets definition|closed set topology]]. The two corresponding procedures of deduction coincide; each one replaces all given subsets of ''X'' with their complements. In this sense, these are two equivalent species.

In the general definition of Bourbaki, deduction procedure may include a change of the principal base set(s), but this case is not treated here. In the language of category theory one have the following result.

''Proposition.'' &lt;ref name="B-IV.1.7" /&gt; Equivalence between two species of structures leads to a [[Natural transformation#Definition|natural isomorphism]] between the corresponding functors.

However, in general, not all natural isomorphisms between these functors correspond to equivalences between the species.&lt;ref group="details"&gt;The set of all possible deduction procedures is countable, while the set of all natural isomorphisms between the considered functors may be uncountable (see an example in Section [[#Canonical, not just natural]]).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mathematical practice==

:"We often do not distinguish structures that are isomorphic and often say that {{'}}''two structures are the same, up to isomorphism''{{'}}."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pudlák|2013|loc=page 13}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:"When studying structures we are interested only in their form, but when we prove their existence we need to construct them."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pudlák|2013|loc=page 22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:'Mathematicians are of course used to identifying isomorphic structures in practice, but they generally do so by "abuse of notation", or some other informal device, knowing that the objects involved are not "really" identical.'&lt;ref name="HoTT"&gt;{{harvnb|The Univalent Foundations Program|2013|loc=Subsection "Univalent foundations" of Introduction}}&lt;/ref&gt; (A radically better approach is expected; but for now, Summer 2014, the definitive book quoted above does not elaborate on structures.)

In practice, one makes no distinction between equivalent species of structures.&lt;ref name="B-IV.1.7" /&gt;

Usually, a text based on natural numbers (for example, the article "[[prime number]]") does not specify the used definition of natural numbers. Likewise, a text based on topological spaces (for example, the article "[[homotopy]]", or "[[inductive dimension]]") does not specify the used definition of a topological space. Thus, it is possible (and rather probable) that the reader and the author interpret the text differently, according to different definitions. Nevertheless, the communication is successful, which means that such different definitions may be thought of as equivalent.

A person acquainted with topological spaces knows basic relations between neighborhoods, convergence, continuity, boundary, closure, interior, open sets, closed sets, and does not need to know that some of these notions are "primary", stipulated in the definition of a topological space, while others are "secondary", characterized in terms of "primary" notions. Moreover, knowing that subsets of a topological space are themselves topological spaces, as well as products of topological spaces, the person is able to construct some new topological spaces irrespective of the definition.

Thus, in practice a topology on a set is treated like an [[abstract data type]] that provides all needed notions (and [[Constructor (object-oriented programming)|constructors]]) but hides the distinction between "primary" and "secondary" notions. The same applies to other kinds of mathematical structures. "Interestingly, the formalization of structures in set theory is a similar task as the formalization of structures for computers."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pudlák|2013|loc=page 34}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Canonical, not just natural==

As was mentioned, equivalence between two species of structures leads to a natural isomorphism between the corresponding functors. However, "[[Natural transformation|natural]]" does not mean "[[Canonical map|canonical]]". A natural transformation is generally non-unique.

Example. Consider again the two equivalent structures for natural numbers. One is the "Peano structure" (0,''S''), the other is the structure (+, ·, ≤) of ordered semiring. If a set ''X'' is endowed by both structures then, on one hand, ''X'' = {{mset| ''a''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, ''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''a''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ... }} where ''S''(''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;) = ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''+1&lt;/sub&gt; for all ''n'' and 0 = ''a''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;; and on the other hand, ''X'' = {{mset| ''b''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, ''b''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''b''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ... }} where ''b''&lt;sub&gt;''m''+''n''&lt;/sub&gt; = ''b''&lt;sub&gt;''m''&lt;/sub&gt; + ''b''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;, ''b''&lt;sub&gt;''m''·''n''&lt;/sub&gt; = ''b''&lt;sub&gt;''m''&lt;/sub&gt; · ''b''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;, and ''b''&lt;sub&gt;''m''&lt;/sub&gt;  ≤''b''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; if and only if ''m'' ≤ ''n''. Requiring that ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; = ''b''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; for all ''n'' one gets the canonical equivalence between the two structures. However, one may also require ''a''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; = ''b''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = ''b''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, and ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; = ''b''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; for all ''n'' &gt; 1, thus getting another, non-canonical, natural isomorphism. Moreover, every [[permutation]] of the index set {{mset| 0, 1, 2, ... }} leads to a natural isomorphism; they are uncountably many!

Another example. A structure of a (simple) graph on a set ''V'' = {{mset| 1, 2, ..., n }} of vertices may be described by means of its [[adjacency matrix]], a (0,1)-matrix of size ''n''×''n'' (with zeros on the diagonal). More generally, for arbitrary ''V'' an adjacency function on ''V'' × ''V'' may be used. The canonical equivalence is given by the rule: "1" means "connected" (with an edge), "0" means "not connected". However, another rule, "0" means "connected", "1" means "not", may be used, and leads to another, natural but not canonical, equivalence. In this example, canonicity is rather a matter of convention. But here is a worse case. Instead of "0" and "1" one may use, say, the two possible orientations of the plane '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; ("clockwise" and "counterclockwise"). It is difficult to choose a canonical rule in this case!

"Natural" is a well-defined mathematical notion, but it does not ensure uniqueness. "Canonical" does, but generally is more or less conventional. A consistent choice of canonical equivalences is an inevitable component of equivalent definitions of mathematical structures.

An '''Erdős–Diophantine graph''' is an object in the [[mathematics|mathematical]] subject of [[Diophantine equations]] consisting of a set of integer points at integer distances in the plane that cannot be extended by any additional points. Equivalently,
it can be described as a [[complete graph]] with vertices located on the [[Integer lattice|integer square grid]] &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle\mathbb{Z}^2&lt;/math&gt; such that all mutual distances between the vertices are integers, while all other grid points have a non-integer distance to at least one vertex.

Erdős–Diophantine graphs are named after [[Paul Erdős]] and [[Diophantus of Alexandria]]. They form a subset of the set of '''Diophantine figures''', which are defined as complete graphs in the Diophantine plane for which the length of all edges are integers ([[unit distance graph]]s). Thus, Erdős–Diophantine graphs are exactly the Diophantine figures that cannot be extended. The existence of Erdős–Diophantine graphs follows from the [[Erdős–Anning theorem]], according to which infinite Diophantine figures must be collinear in the Diophantine plane. Hence, any process of extending a non-collinear Diophantine figure by adding vertices must eventually reach a figure that can no longer be extended.

==Examples==
Any set of zero or one point can be trivially extended, and any Diophantine set of two points can be extended by more points on the same line.Therefore, all Diophantine sets with fewer than three nodes can be extended, so Erdős–Diophantine graphs on fewer than three nodes cannot exist.

By numerical search, {{harvtxt|Kohnert|Kurz|2007}} have shown that three-node Erdős–Diophantine graphs do exist. The smallest Erdős–Diophantine triangle is characterised by edge lengths 2066, 1803, and 505. The next larger Erdős–Diophantine triangle has edges 2549, 2307 and 1492. In both cases, the sum of the three edge-lengths is even. Brancheva has proven that this property holds for all Erdős–Diophantine triangles. More generally, the total length of any closed path in an Erdős–Diophantine graph is always even.

An example of a 4-node Erdős–Diophantine graph is provided by the complete graph formed by the four nodes located on the vertices of a rectangle with sides 4 and&amp;nbsp;3.

A '''Euler spiral''' is a curve whose [[curvature]] changes linearly with its curve length (the curvature of a circular curve is equal to the reciprocal of the radius). Euler spirals are also commonly referred to as '''spiros''', '''clothoids''', or '''Cornu spirals'''.

Euler spirals have applications to [[diffraction]] computations. They are also widely used as transition curves in [[Railway systems engineering|railroad engineering]]/[[highway engineering]] for connecting and transiting the geometry between a tangent and a circular curve. A similar application is also found in [[photonic integrated circuit]]s. The principle of linear variation of the curvature of the transition curve between a tangent and a circular curve defines the geometry of the Euler spiral: 
*Its curvature begins with zero at the straight section (the tangent) and increases linearly with its curve length.
*Where the Euler spiral meets the circular curve, its curvature becomes equal to that of the latter.

==Applications==

===Track transition curve===
{{Main article|Track transition curve}}

[[File:CornuSprialAnimation.gif|thumb|Animation depicting evolution of a Cornu spiral with the tangential circle with the same radius of curvature as at its tip, also known as an [[osculating circle]] (click on thumbnail to observe).]]

To travel along a circular path, an object needs to be subject to a [[Uniform circular motion|centripetal acceleration]] (e.g.: the moon circles around the earth because of gravity; a car turns its front wheels inward to generate a centripetal force). If a vehicle traveling on a straight path were to suddenly transition to a tangential circular path, it would require centripetal acceleration suddenly switching at the tangent point from zero to the required value; this would be difficult to achieve (think of a driver instantly moving the steering wheel from straight line to turning position, and the car actually doing it), putting mechanical stress on vehicle's parts, and causing much discomfort (causing [[Jerk (physics)|jerk]]).

On early railroads this instant application of lateral force was not an issue since low speeds and wide-radius curves were employed (lateral forces on the passengers and the lateral sway was small and tolerable). As speeds of rail vehicles increased over the years, it became obvious that an easement is necessary so that the centripetal acceleration increases linearly with the traveled distance. Given the expression of centripetal acceleration {{math| V² / R}}, the obvious solution is to provide an easement curve whose curvature, {{math| 1 / R}}, increases linearly with the traveled distance. This geometry is an Euler spiral.

Unaware of the solution of the geometry by [[Leonhard Euler]], [[William John Macquorn Rankine|Rankine]] cited the [[Polynomial#Graphs|cubic curve]] (a polynomial curve of degree 3), which is an approximation of the Euler spiral for small angular changes in the same way that a [[parabola]] is an approximation to a circular curve.

[[Marie Alfred Cornu]] (and later some civil engineers) also solved the calculus of Euler spiral independently. Euler spirals are now widely used in rail and highway engineering for providing a transition or an easement between a tangent and a horizontal circular curve.

===Optics===

The Cornu &lt;!--In optics the term Cornu Spiral is universal, please don't change to Euler spiral merely for consistency with the rest of the article without making this clear --&gt; spiral can be used to describe a [[diffraction]] pattern.&lt;ref name=Hecht&gt;

|[[File:Easement curve.svg|360px|right]]
The graph on the right illustrates an Euler spiral used as an easement (transition) curve between two given curves, in this case a straight line (the negative ''x'' axis) and a circle.  The spiral starts at the origin in the positive ''x'' direction and gradually turns anticlockwise to [[osculation|osculate]] the circle.

The spiral is a small segment of the above double-end Euler spiral in the first quadrant.

: From the definition of the curvature,
:: &lt;math&gt;\frac {1}{R} = \frac {d\theta}{ds} \propto s &lt;/math&gt;
:i.e.
:: &lt;math&gt;R s = \text{constant} = R_c s_o&lt;/math&gt;
:: &lt;math&gt;\frac {d\theta}{ds} = \frac {s}{R_c s_o}&lt;/math&gt;

: We write in the format,
::&lt;math&gt;\frac {d\theta}{ds} = 2a^2 s&lt;/math&gt;
:Where
::&lt;math&gt;2a^2= \frac {1}{R_c s_o}&lt;/math&gt;

:Or
::&lt;math&gt;a = \frac {1}{\sqrt {2R_c s_o} }&lt;/math&gt;

:Thus
::&lt;math&gt;\theta = (a s)^2&lt;/math&gt;

:Now
:: &lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
x &amp; = \int_0^L \cos\theta \, ds \\
  &amp; = \int_0^L \cos \left[ (a s)^2 \right] ds
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;
:If
::&lt;math&gt;s' = a s &lt;/math&gt;
:Then
::&lt;math&gt;ds = \frac{ds'}{a}&lt;/math&gt;
:Thus
:: &lt;math&gt;x = \frac{1}{a} \int_0^{L'} \cos {s}^2 ds&lt;/math&gt;

:: &lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
y &amp; = \int_0^L \sin\theta \, ds \\
  &amp; = \int_0^L \sin \left[ (a s)^2 \right] ds \\
  &amp; = \frac{1}{a} \int_0^{L'} \sin {s}^2 \, ds 
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;
|}

===Expansion of Fresnel integral===
{{Main article|Fresnel integral}}

If ''a'' = 1, which is the case for normalized Euler curve, then the Cartesian coordinates are given by Fresnel integrals (or Euler integrals):

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}      C(L) &amp;=\int_0^L\cos(s^2) \, ds\\
      S(L) &amp;= \int_0^L\sin(s^2) \, ds\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

=== Normalization and conclusion ===

For a given Euler curve with:

:&lt;math&gt;2RL = 2R_c L_s = \frac{1}{a^2} &lt;/math&gt;

or
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{R} = \frac{L}{R_c L_s} = 2a^2L &lt;/math&gt;

then
:&lt;math&gt;x=\frac{1}{a} \int_0^{L'} \cos s^2 \, ds&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;y=\frac{1}{a} \int_0^{L'} \sin s^2 \, ds &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;L' = aL &lt;/math&gt;  and  &lt;math&gt;a = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2R_c L_s}}&lt;/math&gt;.

The process of obtaining solution of {{math|(''x'', ''y'')}} of an Euler spiral can thus be described as:
* Map ''L'' of the original Euler spiral by multiplying with factor ''a'' to ''L''&amp;prime; of the normalized Euler spiral;
* Find {{math|(''x''&amp;prime;, ''y''&amp;prime;)}} from the Fresnel integrals; and
* Map {{math|(''x''&amp;prime;, ''y''&amp;prime;)}} to {{math|(''x'', ''y'')}} by scaling up (denormalize) with factor &lt;math&gt; 1/a &lt;/math&gt;. Note that &lt;math&gt; 1/a &gt; 1 &lt;/math&gt;.

In the normalization process,

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
R'_c &amp; = \frac{R_c}{\sqrt{2 R_c L_s}} \\
     &amp; = \sqrt{\frac{R_c}{2L_s}} \\
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
L'_s &amp; = \frac{L_s}{\sqrt{2R_c L_s}} \\
     &amp; = \sqrt{\frac{L_s}{2R_c}}
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;
Then
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
2R'_c L'_s &amp; = 2 \sqrt{\frac{R_c}{2L_s} } \sqrt{\frac{L_s}{2 R_c}} \\
           &amp; = \tfrac{2}{2} \\
           &amp; = 1
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

Generally the normalization reduces L' to a small value (&lt;1) and results in good converging characteristics of the Fresnel integral manageable with only a few terms (at a price of increased [[Numerical stability|numerical instability]] of the calculation, esp. for bigger ''&lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt;'' values.).

&lt;!-- Original Research?
==== Proposed distinction between Euler spiral and Cornu spiral ====

It is proposed that the term '''Euler spiral''' applies generally where as the term '''Cornu spiral''' shall only apply to the scaled down version of Euler spiral that has 2Rc'.Ls' = 1.
--&gt;

==== Illustration ====
Given:
:&lt;math&gt;
   \begin{align}
   R_c &amp; = 300\mbox{m} \\
   L_s &amp;= 100\mbox{m}
   \end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;
Then
:&lt;math&gt;
   \begin{align}
   \theta_s &amp; = \frac{L_s} {2R_c} \\
       &amp; = \frac{100} {2 \times 300} \\
       &amp; = 0.1667 \ \mbox{radian} \\
    \end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;
And
:&lt;math&gt; 2R_c L_s = 60,000 &lt;/math&gt;

We scale down the Euler spiral by {{radic|60,000}}, i.e.100{{radic|6}} to normalized Euler spiral that has:
:&lt;math&gt;
   \begin{align}
      R'_c = \tfrac{3}{\sqrt{6}}\mbox{m} \\
      L'_s = \tfrac{1}{\sqrt{6}}\mbox{m} \\
      \\
   \end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
   \begin{align}
   2R'_c L'_s &amp; = 2 \times \tfrac{3}{\sqrt{6}} \times \tfrac{1}{\sqrt{6}} \\
              &amp; = 1 
   \end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;
And
:&lt;math&gt;
   \begin{align}
    \theta_s &amp; = \frac{L'_s}{2R'_c} \\
       &amp; = \frac{\tfrac{1}{\sqrt{6}}} {2 \times \tfrac{3}{\sqrt{6}}} \\
       &amp; = 0.1667 \ \mbox{radian} \\
   \end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

The two angles &lt;math&gt;\theta_s&lt;/math&gt; are the same. This thus confirms that the original and normalized Euler spirals are geometrically similar. The locus of the normalized curve can be determined from Fresnel Integral, while the locus of the original Euler spiral can be obtained by scaling back / up or denormalizing.

===Other properties of normalized Euler spirals===

Normalized Euler spirals can be expressed as:

:&lt;math&gt;x = \int_0^L \cos s^2 ds&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;y = \int_0^L \sin s^2 ds&lt;/math&gt;

Or expressed as [[power series]]:

:&lt;math&gt;x = \left . \sum_{i=0}^{\infty} \frac{(-1)^i}{(2i)!} \frac{s^{4i+1}}{4i+1} \right |_0^{L} =\sum_{i=0}^{\infty} \frac{(-1)^i}{(2i)!} \frac{L^{4i+1}}{4i+1} &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;y = \left . \sum_{i=0}^{\infty} \frac{(-1)^i}{(2i+1)!} \frac{s^{4i+3}}{4i+3} \right |_0^{L} =\sum_{i=0}^{\infty} \frac{(-1)^i}{(2i+1)!} \frac{L^{4i+3}}{4i+3} &lt;/math&gt;

The normalized Euler spiral will converge to a single point in the limit, which can be expressed as:

:&lt;math&gt;x^\prime = \lim_{L \to \infty} \int_0^{L} \cos (s^2) ds = \frac{1}{2} \sqrt{\frac{\pi}{2}}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;y^\prime = \lim_{L \to \infty} \int_0^{L} \sin (s^2) ds = \frac{1}{2} \sqrt{\frac{\pi}{2}}&lt;/math&gt;

Normalized Euler spirals have the following properties:

:&lt;math&gt;2 R_c L_s = 1 &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\theta_s = \frac{L_s}{2 R_c} = L_s ^2&lt;/math&gt;

And

:&lt;math&gt;\theta = \theta _s\cdot\frac{L^2}{L_s^2} = L^2&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{R} = \frac{d\theta}{dL} = 2L&lt;/math&gt;

Note that &lt;math&gt;2R_c L_s = 1&lt;/math&gt; also means &lt;math&gt;1/R_c = 2L_s&lt;/math&gt;, in agreement with the last mathematical statement.

== Code for producing an Euler spiral ==
The following [[SageMath]] code produces the second graph above. The first four lines express the Euler spiral component. Fresnel functions could not be found. Instead, the integrals of two expanded Taylor series are adopted. The remaining code expresses respectively the tangent and the circle, including the computation for the center coordinates.

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang="matlab"&gt;
var('L')
p = integral(taylor(cos(L^2), L, 0, 12), L)
q = integral(taylor(sin(L^2), L, 0, 12), L)
r1 = parametric_plot([p, q], (L, 0, 1), color = 'red')
r2 = line([(-1.0, 0), (0,0)], rgbcolor = 'blue')
x1 = p.subs(L = 1)
y1 = q.subs(L = 1)
R = 0.5
x2 = x1 - R*sin(1.0)
y2 = y1 + R*cos(1.0)
r3 = circle((x2, y2), R, rgbcolor = 'green')
show(r1 + r2 + r3, aspect_ratio = 1, axes=false)
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

The following is [[Mathematica]] code for the Euler spiral component (it works directly in wolframalpha.com):

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang="mathematica"&gt;
ParametricPlot[{
  FresnelC[Sqrt[2/\[Pi]] t]/Sqrt[2/\[Pi]],
  FresnelS[Sqrt[2/\[Pi]] t]/Sqrt[2/\[Pi]]
}, {t, -10, 10}]
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

The following is [[Xcas]] code for the Euler spiral component:

&lt;pre&gt;
plotparam([int(cos(u^2),u,0,t),int(sin(u^2),u,0,t)],t,-4,4)
&lt;/pre&gt;

The following is [[SageMath]] code for the complete double ended Euler spiral:

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang="matlab"&gt;
s = var('s')
parametric_plot((lambda s: numerical_integral(cos(x**2),0,s)[0], lambda s: numerical_integral(sin(x**2),0,s)[0]), (-3*pi/2, 3*pi/2))
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

The following is [[JavaScript]] code for drawing an Euler spiral on a [[canvas element]]:

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang="javascript"&gt;
function drawEulerSpiral(canvas, T, N, scale) {
      ctx = canvas.getContext("2d");
      var dx, dy, t=0, prev = {x:0, y:0}, current;
      var dt = T/N;
      ctx.beginPath();
      while (N--) {
         dx = Math.cos(t*t) * dt;
         dy = Math.sin(t*t) * dt;
         t += dt;
         current = {
            x: prev.x + dx,
            y: prev.y + dy
         };
         ctx.lineTo(current.x*scale, current.y*scale);
         prev = current;
      }
      ctx.stroke();
}
drawEulerSpiral(document.getElementById("myCanvas"),10,10000,100)
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

The following is [[Logo (programming language)]] code for drawing the Euler spiral using the turtle sprite.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13210">'''Expected shortfall''' ('''ES''') is a [[risk measure]]—a concept used in the field of financial risk measurement to evaluate the [[market risk]] or [[credit risk]] of a portfolio. The "expected shortfall at q% level" is the expected return on the portfolio in the worst &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt;% of cases. ES is an alternative to [[value at risk]] that is more sensitive to the shape of the tail of the loss distribution.

Expected shortfall is also called '''conditional value at risk''' ('''CVaR'''), '''average value at risk''' ('''AVaR'''), and '''expected tail loss''' ('''ETL''').

ES estimates the risk of an investment in a conservative way, focusing on the less profitable outcomes. For high values of &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt; it ignores the most profitable but unlikely possibilities, while for small values of &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt; it focuses on the worst losses. On the other hand, unlike the [[discounted maximum loss]], even for lower values of &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt; the expected shortfall does not consider only the single most catastrophic outcome. A value of &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt; often used in practice is 5%.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}

Expected shortfall is considered a more useful risk measure than VaR because it is a [[Coherent risk measure|coherent]], and moreover a [[Spectral risk measure|spectral]], [[Risk measure|measure]] of financial portfolio risk. It is calculated for a given [[quantile]]-level &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt;, and is defined to be the mean loss of [[Portfolio (finance)|portfolio]] value given that a loss is occurring at or below the &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt;-quantile.

==Formal definition==
If &lt;math&gt;X \in L^p(\mathcal{F})&lt;/math&gt; (an [[Lp space]]) is the payoff of a portfolio at some future time and &lt;math&gt;0 &lt; \alpha &lt; 1&lt;/math&gt; then we define the expected shortfall as

:&lt;math&gt;ES_{\alpha} = -\frac{1}{\alpha}\int_0^{\alpha} \mbox{VaR}_{\gamma}(X)d\gamma&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\mbox{VaR}_{\gamma}&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Value at risk]].  This can be equivalently written as

:&lt;math&gt;ES_{\alpha} = -\frac{1}{\alpha}\left(E[X \ 1_{\{X \leq x_{\alpha}\}}] + x_{\alpha}(\alpha - P[X \leq x_{\alpha}])\right)&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;x_{\alpha} = \inf\{x \in \mathbb{R}: P(X \leq x) \geq \alpha\}&lt;/math&gt; is the lower &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt;-[[quantile]] and &lt;math&gt;1_A(x) = \begin{cases}1 &amp;\text{if }x \in A\\ 0 &amp;\text{else}\end{cases}&lt;/math&gt; is the [[indicator function]].&lt;ref name="AcerbiTasche"&gt;{{cite journal|

where &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{Q}_{\alpha}&lt;/math&gt; is the set of [[probability measure]]s which are [[absolutely continuous]] to the physical measure &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;\frac{dQ}{dP} \leq \alpha^{-1}&lt;/math&gt; [[almost surely]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Föllmer|first=H.|last2=Schied|first2=A.|year=2008|title=Convex and coherent risk measures|url=http://wws.mathematik.hu-berlin.de/~foellmer/papers/CCRM.pdf|format=pdf|accessdate=October 4, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Note that &lt;math&gt;\frac{dQ}{dP}&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Radon–Nikodym derivative]] of &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt; with respect to &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt;.

Expected Shortfall can be generalized to a general class of coherent risk measures on &lt;math&gt;L^p&lt;/math&gt; spaces ([[Lp space]]) with a corresponding dual characterization in the corresopnding &lt;math&gt;L^q&lt;/math&gt; [[Lp space#Dual spaces|dual space]].

If the underlying distribution for &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is a continuous distribution then the expected shortfall is equivalent to the [[tail conditional expectation]] defined by &lt;math&gt;TCE_{\alpha}(X) = E[-X\mid X \leq -VaR_{\alpha}(X)]&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://statistik.ets.kit.edu/download/doc_secure1/7_StochModels.pdf|title=Average Value at Risk|format=pdf|accessdate=February 2, 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719222242/https://statistik.ets.kit.edu/download/doc_secure1/7_StochModels.pdf|archivedate=July 19, 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Informally, and non rigorously, this equation amounts to saying "in case of losses so severe that they occur only alpha percent of the time, what is our average loss".

Expected shortfall can also be written as a [[distortion risk measure]] given by the [[distortion function]] &lt;math&gt;g(x) = \begin{cases}\frac{x}{1-\alpha} &amp; \text{if }0 \leq x &lt; 1-\alpha,\\ 1 &amp; \text{if }1-\alpha \leq x \leq 1.\end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref name="Wirch"&gt;{{cite web|title=Distortion Risk Measures: Coherence and Stochastic Dominance|author=Julia L.

== Examples ==

Example 1.  If we believe our average loss on the worst 5% of the possible outcomes for our portfolio is EUR 1000, then we could say our expected shortfall is EUR 1000 for the 5% tail.

Example 2. Consider a portfolio that will have the following possible values at the end of the period:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! probability
! ending value
|-
! of event
! of the portfolio
|-
| 10%
| 0
|-
| 30%
| 80
|-
| 40%
| 100
|-
| 20%
| 150
|}

Now assume that we paid 100 at the beginning of the period for this portfolio.  Then the profit in each case is (''ending value''−100) or:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! probability
!
|-
! of event
! profit
|-
| 10%
| −100
|-
| 30%
| −20
|-
| 40%
| 0
|-
| 20%
| 50
|}

From this table let us calculate the expected shortfall &lt;math&gt;ES_q&lt;/math&gt; for a few values of &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt;:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt;
! expected shortfall &lt;math&gt;ES_q&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| 5%
| 100
|-
| 10%
| 100
|-
| 20%
| 60
|-
| 30%
| 46.&lt;span style="text-decoration: overline;"&gt;6&lt;/span&gt;
|-
| 40%
| 40
|-
| 50%
| 32
|-
| 60%
| 26.&lt;span style="text-decoration: overline;"&gt;6&lt;/span&gt;
|-
| 80%
| 20
|-
| 90%
| 12.&lt;span style="text-decoration: overline;"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;
|-
| 100%
| 6
|}

To see how these values were calculated, consider the calculation of &lt;math&gt;ES_{0.05}&lt;/math&gt;, the expectation in the worst 5% of cases.  These cases belong to (are a [[subset]] of) row 1 in the profit table, which have a profit of −100 (total loss of the 100 invested). The expected profit for these cases is −100.

Now consider the calculation of &lt;math&gt;ES_{0.20}&lt;/math&gt;, the expectation in the worst 20 out of 100 cases.  These cases are as follows: 10 cases from row one, and 10 cases from row two (note that 10+10 equals the desired 20 cases). For row 1 there is a profit of −100, while for row 2 a profit of −20.  Using the expected value formula we get

: &lt;math&gt;\frac{ \frac{10}{100}(-100)+\frac{10}{100}(-20) }{ \frac{20}{100}} = -60.&lt;/math&gt;

Similarly for any value of &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt;. We select as many rows starting from the top as are necessary to give a cumulative probability of &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt; and then calculate an expectation over those cases.  In general the last row selected may not be fully used (for example in calculating &lt;math&gt;-ES_{0.20}&lt;/math&gt; we used only 10 of the 30 cases per 100 provided by row 2).

As a final example, calculate &lt;math&gt;-ES_1&lt;/math&gt;.  This is the expectation over all cases, or

: &lt;math&gt;0.1(-100)+0.3(-20)+0.4\cdot 0+0.2\cdot 50 = -6. \, &lt;/math&gt;

The [[Value at risk|Value at Risk (VaR)]] is given below for comparison.

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt;
! &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{VaR}_q&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| 0% ≤ &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt; &lt; 10%
| −100
|-
| 10% ≤ &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt; &lt; 40%
| −20
|-
| 40% ≤ &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt; &lt; 80%
| 0
|-
| 80% ≤ &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt; ≤ 100%
| 50
|}

== Properties ==
The expected shortfall &lt;math&gt;ES_q&lt;/math&gt; increases as &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt; decreases.

The 100%-quantile expected shortfall &lt;math&gt;ES_{1.0}&lt;/math&gt; equals the [[expected value]] of the portfolio.

For a given portfolio, the expected shortfall &lt;math&gt;ES_q&lt;/math&gt; is greater than or equal to the Value at Risk &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{VaR}_q&lt;/math&gt; at the same &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt; level.

== Dynamic expected shortfall ==
The [[conditional risk measure|conditional]] version of the expected shortfall at the time ''t'' is defined by

:&lt;math&gt;ES_{\alpha}^t(X) = \operatorname*{ess\sup}_{Q \in \mathcal{Q}_{\alpha}^t} E^Q[-X\mid\mathcal{F}_t]&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{Q}_{\alpha}^t = \{Q = P\,\vert_{\mathcal{F}_t}: \frac{dQ}{dP} \leq \alpha_t^{-1} \mathrm{ a.s.}\}&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Conditional and dynamic convex risk measures|first1=Kai|last1=Detlefsen|first2=Giacomo|last2=Scandolo|journal=Finance Stoch.|volume=9|issue=4|pages=539–561|year=2005|url=http://www.dmd.unifi.it/scandolo/pdf/Scandolo-Detlefsen-05.pdf|format=pdf|accessdate=October 11, 2011|doi=10.1007/s00780-005-0159-6|citeseerx=10.1.1.453.4944}}{{Dead link|date=January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Dynamic convex risk measures |first1=Beatrice |last1=Acciaio |first2=Irina |last2=Penner |year=2011 |url=http://wws.mathematik.hu-berlin.de/~penner/Acciaio_Penner.pdf |format=pdf |accessdate=October 11, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110902182345/http://wws.mathematik.hu-berlin.de/~penner/Acciaio_Penner.pdf |archivedate=September 2, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2566">'''Extremal combinatorics''' is a field of [[combinatorics]], which is itself a part of [[mathematics]]. Extremal combinatorics studies how large or how small a collection of finite objects ([[number]]s, [[Graph (discrete mathematics)|graph]]s, [[vector space|vector]]s, [[Set (mathematics)|sets]], etc.) can be, if it has to satisfy certain restrictions.

Much of extremal combinatorics concerns [[class (set theory)|class]]es of sets; this is called '''extremal set theory'''.  For instance, in an ''n''-element set, what is the largest number of ''k''-element [[subset]]s that can pairwise intersect one another?  What is the largest number of subsets of which none contains any other?  The latter question is answered by [[Sperner family#Sperner's theorem|Sperner's theorem]], which gave rise to much of extremal set theory.

Another kind of example:  How many people can we invite to a party where among each three people there are two who know each other and two who don't know each other? [[Ramsey theory]] shows that at most five persons can attend such a party. Or, suppose we are given a finite set of nonzero integers, and are asked to mark as large a subset as possible of this set under the restriction that the sum of any two marked integers cannot be marked. It appears that (independent of what the given integers actually are!) we can always mark at least one-third of them.

The '''Fundamental Fysiks Group''' was founded in [[San Francisco]] in May 1975 by two physicists, [[Elizabeth Rauscher]] and George Weissmann, at the time both graduate students at the [[University of California, Berkeley]]. The group held informal discussions on Friday afternoons to explore the philosophical implications of [[Quantum mechanics|quantum theory]]. Leading members included [[Fritjof Capra]], [[John Clauser]], Philippe Eberhard, [[Nick Herbert (physicist)|Nick Herbert]], [[Jack Sarfatti]], Saul-Paul Sirag, [[Henry Stapp]], and [[Fred Alan Wolf]].&lt;ref&gt;Kaiser, David. ''How the Hippies Saved Physics: Science, Counterculture, and the Quantum Revival''. [[W. W. Norton &amp; Company]], 2011, p. xi–xvii, xxiii, 43ff, 101.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[David Kaiser]] argues, in ''How the Hippies Saved Physics: Science, Counterculture, and the Quantum Revival'' (2011), that the group's meetings and papers helped to nurture the ideas in quantum physics that came to form the basis of [[quantum information science]].&lt;ref&gt;Kaiser 2011, p. xi–xvii.&lt;/ref&gt; Two reviewers wrote that Kaiser may have exaggerated the group's influence on the future of physics research, though one of them, [[Silvan S. Schweber|Silvan Schweber]], wrote that some of the group's contributions are easy to identify, such as Clauser's experimental evidence for non-locality attracting a share of the [[Wolf Prize]] in 2010, and the publication of Capra's ''[[The Tao of Physics]]'' (1975) and Zukav's ''[[The Dancing Wu Li Masters]]'' (1979) attracting the interest of a wider audience.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, George.

Kaiser writes that the group were "very smart and very playful", discussing [[quantum mysticism]] and becoming local celebrities in the Bay Area's counterculture. When [[Francis Ford Coppola]] bought ''City Magazine'' in 1975, one of its earliest features was on the Fundamental Fysiks Group, including a photo spread of Sirag, Wolf, Herbert, and Sarfatti.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20111113134145/http://forum-network.org/lecture/how-hippies-saved-physics Kaiser lecture April 2010], archived, 21:00 mins, 23:22 mins; Kaiser 2011, p. xviii.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Hugh Gusterson]] writes that several challenging ideas lie at the heart of quantum physics: that electrons behave like waves and particles; that you can know a particle's location or momentum, but not both; that observing a particle changes its behavior; and that particles appear to communicate with each other across great distances, known as [[Quantum nonlocality|nonlocality]] and [[quantum entanglement]]. It is these concepts that led to the development of quantum information science and [[quantum encryption]], which has been experimentally used, for example, to transfer money and electronic votes.&lt;ref&gt;Gusterson, Hugh. [http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v476/n7360/full/476278a.html "Physics: Quantum outsiders"], ''Nature'', 476, 278–279, August 18, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Kaiser argues that the Fundamental Fysiks Group saved physics by exploring these ideas, in three ways:

{{quote|They self-consciously opened up space again ... for the kind of spirited philosophical engagement with fundamental physics that the Cold War decades had dampened. More than most of their generation, they sought to recapture the big-picture search for meaning that had driven their heroes—[[Einstein]], [[Niels Bohr|Bohr]], [[Werner Heisenberg|Heisenberg]], and [[Schrödinger]]—and to smuggle that mode of doing physics back into their daily routine.

Second, members of the Fundamental Fysiks Group latched onto a topic, known as "[[Bell's theorem]]," and rescued it from a decade of unrelenting obscurity. The theorem ... stipulated that quantum objects that had once interacted would retain some strange link or connection, even after they had moved arbitrarily far apart from each other. ... Working in various genres and media, the Fundamental Fysiks Group grappled with Bell's theorem and quantum entanglement. ... In the process, they forced a few of their physicist peers to pay attention to the topic ... From these battles, quantum information science was born.

The hippie physicists' concerted push on Bell's theorem and quantum entanglement instigated major breakthroughs ... The most important became known as the "[[no-cloning theorem]]," a new insight into quantum theory that emerged from spirited efforts to wrestle with hypothetical machines dreamed up by members of the Fundamental Fysiks Group.&lt;ref&gt;Kaiser 2011, pp. xiii–xxxv.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Specifically, in 1981, Nick Herbert, a member of the group, proposed a scheme for sending signals faster than the [[speed of light]] using [[quantum entanglement]].&lt;ref&gt;Herbert, Nick. [http://www.springerlink.com/content/w22518524x75w1pn/ "FLASH—A superluminal communicator based upon a new kind of quantum measurement"], ''Foundations of Physics'', vol 12, issue 12, 1982, pp. 1171–117.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Quantum computing]] pioneer [[Asher Peres]] writes that the refutation of Herbert's ideas led to the development of the no-cloning theorem by [[William Wootters]], [[Wojciech H. Zurek|Wojciech Zurek]], and Dennis Dieks.&lt;ref&gt;Peres, Asher. [http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/prop.200310062/abstract "How the No-Cloning Theorem Got its Name"], ''Fortschritte der Physik'', vol 51, issue 4–5, May 2003, pp. 458–461.&lt;/ref&gt;

In a review of Kaiser's book in ''[[Physics Today]]'', Silvan Schweber challenges Kaiser's views of the importance of the Fundamental Fysiks Group. He writes that Bell's Theorem was not obscure during the preceding decade, but was worked on by authors such as John Clauser (who was a member of the group) and [[Eugene Wigner]]. Schweber also mentioned the work of [[Alain Aspect]], which preceded Nick Herbert's 1981 proposal.&lt;ref&gt;Schweber, Silvan. "How the Hippies Saved Physics - Reviewed by Silvan Schweber", ''Physics Today'', September 2011, 59–60.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Remote viewing===
Given quantum theory's perceived implications for the study of [[parapsychology]] and [[telepathy]], the group cultivated patrons such as the [[Central Intelligence Agency]], [[Defense Intelligence Agency]], and the [[human potential movement]]. In 1972, the CIA and DIA set up a research program, jokingly called ESPionage,&lt;ref&gt;Kaiser 2011, p. 93&lt;/ref&gt; which financed experiments into [[remote viewing]] at the [[Stanford Research Institute]], where the Fundamental Fysiks Group became what Kaiser calls its house theorists.&lt;ref name=Kaiser&gt;Kaiser, David.

In [[mathematical analysis]], many generalizations of [[Fourier series]] have proved to be useful.
They are all special cases of decompositions over an [[orthonormal basis]] of an [[inner product space]].
Here we consider that of [[square-integrable]] functions defined on an [[Interval (mathematics)|interval]] of the [[real line]], which is important, among others, for [[interpolation]] theory.

==Definition==

Consider a set of [[square-integrable]] functions with values in &lt;math&gt; \mathbb{F}=\mathbb{C}\mbox{ or }\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt;,

:&lt;math&gt;\Phi = \{\varphi_n:[a,b]\rightarrow \mathbb{F}\}_{n=0}^\infty,&lt;/math&gt;

which are pairwise [[orthogonal]] for the [[inner product]]

:&lt;math&gt;\langle f, g\rangle_w = \int_a^b f(x)\,\overline{g}(x)\,w(x)\,dx&lt;/math&gt;

where ''w''(''x'') is a [[weight function]], and &lt;math&gt;\overline\cdot&lt;/math&gt; represents [[complex conjugation]], i.e. &lt;math&gt;\overline{g}(x)=g(x)&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt; \mathbb{F}=\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt;.

The '''generalized Fourier series''' of a [[square-integrable]] function ''f'': [''a'', ''b''] → &lt;math&gt; \mathbb{F}&lt;/math&gt;,
with respect to Φ, is then

:&lt;math&gt;f(x) \sim \sum_{n=0}^\infty c_n\varphi_n(x),&lt;/math&gt;

where the coefficients are given by

:&lt;math&gt;c_n = {\langle f, \varphi_n \rangle_w\over \|\varphi_n\|_w^2}.&lt;/math&gt;

If Φ is a complete set, i.e., an [[orthonormal basis]] of the space of all square-integrable functions on [''a'', ''b''], as opposed to a smaller orthonormal set,
the relation &lt;math&gt;\sim \,&lt;/math&gt; becomes equality in the ''[[L2 space|L²]]'' sense, more precisely modulo |·|&lt;sub&gt;''w''&lt;/sub&gt; (not necessarily pointwise, nor [[almost everywhere]]).

== Example (Fourier–Legendre series) ==
The [[Legendre polynomials]] are solutions to the [[Sturm–Liouville theory|Sturm–Liouville problem]]

: &lt;math&gt; \left((1-x^2)P_n'(x)\right)'+n(n+1)P_n(x)=0&lt;/math&gt;

and because of Sturm-Liouville theory, these polynomials are eigenfunctions of the problem and are solutions orthogonal with respect to the inner product above with unit weight. So we can form a generalized Fourier series (known as a Fourier–Legendre series) involving the Legendre polynomials, and

:&lt;math&gt;f(x) \sim \sum_{n=0}^\infty c_n P_n(x),&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;c_n = {\langle f, P_n \rangle_w\over \|P_n\|_w^2}&lt;/math&gt;

As an example, let us calculate the Fourier–Legendre series for ''&amp;fnof;''(''x'')&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;cos&amp;nbsp;''x'' over [&amp;minus;1,&amp;nbsp;1]. Now,

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
c_0 &amp; = {\int_{-1}^1 \cos{x}\,dx \over \int_{-1}^1 (1)^2 \,dx}  = \sin{1} \\
c_1 &amp;  = {\int_{-1}^1 x \cos{x}\,dx \over \int_{-1}^1 x^2 \, dx} = {0 \over 2/3 } =0 \\
c_2 &amp; =  {\int_{-1}^1 {3x^2 - 1 \over 2} \cos{x} \, dx \over \int_{-1}^1 {9x^4-6x^2+1 \over 4} \, dx} = {6 \cos{1} - 4\sin{1} \over 2/5 }
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

and a series involving these terms

:&lt;math&gt;c_2P_2(x)+c_1P_1(x)+c_0P_0(x)= {5 \over 2} (6 \cos{1} - 4\sin{1})\left({3x^2 - 1 \over 2}\right) + \sin1&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;= \left({45 \over 2} \cos{1} - 15 \sin{1}\right)x^2+6 \sin{1} - {15 \over 2}\cos{1}&lt;/math&gt;

which differs from cos ''x'' by approximately 0.003, about&amp;nbsp;0. It may be advantageous to use such Fourier–Legendre series since the eigenfunctions are all polynomials and hence the integrals and thus the coefficients are easier to calculate.

== Coefficient theorems ==
Some theorems on the coefficients ''c''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; include:

===Bessel's inequality===

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{n=0}^\infty |c_n|^2\leq\int_a^b|f(x)|^2w(x)\,dx.&lt;/math&gt;

===Parseval's theorem===
If Φ is a complete set,
:&lt;math&gt; \sum_{n=0}^\infty |c_n|^2 = \int_a^b |f(x)|^2w(x)\, dx.&lt;/math&gt;

'''Gil Kalai''' (born 1955) is the Henry and Manya Noskwith Professor of [[Mathematics]] at the [[Hebrew University of Jerusalem]], and adjunct professor of mathematics and of computer science at [[Yale University]].&lt;ref name="yale"/&gt;

==Biography==
Gil Kalai received his Ph.D. from Hebrew University in 1983, under the supervision of [[Micha Perles]],&lt;ref&gt;{{MathGenealogy|name=Gil Kalai|id=62336}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and joined the Hebrew University faculty in 1985 after a postdoctoral fellowship at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]].&lt;ref name="tue"&gt;[http://www.win.tue.nl/math/eidma/courses/minicourses/kalai/MC-DAG-7.html Profile at the Technical University of Eindhoven] as an instructor of a minicourse on polyhedral combinatorics.&lt;/ref&gt; He was the recipient of the [[Pólya Prize (SIAM)|Pólya Prize]] in 1992, the [[Erdős Prize]] of the Israel Mathematical Society in 1993, and the [[Fulkerson Prize]] in 1994.&lt;ref name="yale"&gt;[http://www.cs.yale.edu/people/kalai.html Profile at Yale CS department].&lt;/ref&gt; He is known for finding variants of the [[simplex algorithm]] in [[linear programming]] that can be proven to run in subexponential time,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first=Gil|last=Kalai|contribution=A subexponential randomized simplex algorithm|title=Proc. 24th ACM Symp. Theory of Computing (STOC 1992)|year=1992|pages=475–482}}.&lt;/ref&gt; for showing that every [[Hereditary property|monotone property of graphs]] has a sharp [[phase transition]],&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|doi=10.1090/S0002-9939-96-03732-X|first1=Ehud|last1=Friedgut|first2=Gil|last2=Kalai|title=Every monotone graph property has a sharp threshold|journal=[[Proceedings of the American Mathematical Society]]|volume=124|year=1996|pages=2993–3002|url=http://www.ams.org/proc/1996-124-10/S0002-9939-96-03732-X/}}.&lt;/ref&gt; for solving Borsuk's problem (known as [[Borsuk's conjecture]]) on the number of pieces needed to partition convex sets into subsets of smaller diameter,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|doi=10.1090/S0273-0979-1993-00398-7|first1=Jeff|last1=Kahn|first2=Gil|last2=Kalai|arxiv=math.MG/9307229 |title=A counterexample to Borsuk's conjecture|journal=[[Bulletin of the American Mathematical Society]]|volume=29|year=1993|pages=60–62}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and for his work on the [[Hirsch conjecture]] on the diameter of [[convex polytope]]s and in [[polyhedral combinatorics]] more generally.&lt;ref name="kk"&gt;{{citation|doi=10.1090/S0273-0979-1992-00285-9|first1=Gil|last1=Kalai|first2=Daniel J.|last2=Kleitman|authorlink2=Daniel Kleitman|title=A quasi-polynomial bound for the diameter of graphs of polyhedra|journal=Bulletin of the American Mathematical Society|volume=26|year=1992|pages=315–316|url=http://www.ams.org/bull/1992-26-02/S0273-0979-1992-00285-9/|arxiv=math/9204233}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

He was the winner of the 2012 Rothschild Prize in mathematics.&lt;ref&gt;Yad Hanadiv, [http://www.yadhanadiv.org.il/fellowship-prize/rothschild-prize Rothschild Prize].&lt;/ref&gt;  From 1995 to 2001, he was the Editor-in-Chief of the [[Israel Journal of Mathematics]]. In 2016, he was elected honorary member of the [[Hungarian Academy of Sciences]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A Magyar Tudományos Akadémia újonnan megválasztott tagjai (The newly elected members of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences)|website=Magyar Tudományos Akadémia (mta.hu)|date=2 May 2016|url=http://mta.hu/kozgyules2016/a-magyar-tudomanyos-akademia-ujonnan-megvalasztott-tagjai-106411}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2018 he was a plenary speaker with talk ''Noise Stability, Noise Sensitivity and the Quantum Computer Puzzle'' at the [[International Congress of Mathematicians]] in Rio de Janeiro.

==Kalai's conjectures on quantum computing==
'''Conjecture 1 (No quantum error correction)'''. The process for creating a quantum error-correcting code will necessarily lead to a mixture of the desired codewords with undesired codewords. The probability of the undesired codewords is uniformly bounded away from zero. (In every implementation of quantum error-correcting codes with one encoded qubit, the probability of not getting the intended qubit is at least some δ &gt; 0, independently of the number of qubits used for encoding.)

'''Conjecture 2'''. A noisy quantum computer is subject to noise in which information leaks for two substantially entangled qubits have a substantial positive correlation.

'''Conjecture 3'''. In any quantum computer at a highly entangled state there will be a strong effect of error-synchronization.

'''Conjecture 4'''. Noisy quantum processes are subject to detrimental noise.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ma.huji.ac.il/~kalai/Qitamar.pdf ''How Quantum Computers Fail'' by Gil Kalai (2011)]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Hampshire College Summer Studies in Mathematics''' ('''HCSSiM''') is an American residential program for mathematically talented high school students.  The program has been conducted each summer since 1971, with the exceptions of 1981 and 1996, and has more than 1500 alumni.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.hcssim.org/faq.html | title=HCSSiM home page, Frequently and Less Frequently Asked Questions with Frequent Answers | accessdate=2008-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=Laura A. | last=Haight | title=Hamming It Up At Hampshire: Mathematics Gone Hogwild | work=[[Harvard Crimson]] | date=1982-02-05 | url=http://www.thecrimson.com/article.aspx?ref=186796 | accessdate=2007-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The program was created and is still headed by Professor [[David Kelly (mathematician)|David C. Kelly]].  

==Background==
The program is housed at [[Hampshire College]] in [[Amherst, Massachusetts|Amherst]], [[Massachusetts]], and generally runs for six weeks from early July until mid-August.  The program itself consists of lectures, study sessions, math workshops (general-knowledge classes), maxi-courses (three-week classes run by the senior staff members), and mini-courses (specialized shorter classes).

On a typical day, students spend four hours in the morning in class, have lunch together with the faculty, and then have several hours to use at their leisure. During this "down time" students and faculty members often host quasis, where they participate in an activity as a small group, such as juggling or making sushi. They return for the "Prime Time Theorem" (an hour-long talk on an interesting piece of mathematics given by a faculty member or a visitor), have dinner, and then spend three hours in a problem solving session.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3539">In [[mathematics]], the '''Hausdorff maximal principle''' is an alternate and earlier formulation of [[Zorn's lemma]] proved by [[Felix Hausdorff]] in 1914 (Moore 1982:168). It states that in any [[partial order|partially ordered set]], every [[total order|totally ordered]] [[subset]] is contained in a maximal totally ordered subset.

The Hausdorff maximal principle is one of many statements equivalent to the [[axiom of choice]] over ZF ([[Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory]] without the axiom of choice). The principle is also called the '''Hausdorff maximality theorem''' or the '''Kuratowski lemma''' (Kelley 1955:33).

==Statement==

The Hausdorff maximal principle states that, in any [[partial order|partially ordered set]], every [[total order|totally ordered]] [[subset]] is contained in a maximal totally ordered subset. Here a maximal totally ordered subset is one that, if enlarged in any way, does not remain totally ordered. The maximal set produced by the principle is not unique, in general; there may be many maximal totally ordered subsets containing a given totally ordered subset.

An equivalent form of the principle is that in every partially ordered set there exists a maximal totally ordered subset.

To prove that it follows from the original form, let ''A'' be a [[poset]]. Then &lt;math&gt;\varnothing&lt;/math&gt; is a totally ordered subset of ''A'', hence there exists a maximal totally ordered subset containing &lt;math&gt;\varnothing&lt;/math&gt;, in particular ''A'' contains a maximal totally ordered subset.

For the converse direction, let ''A'' be a partially ordered set and ''T'' a totally ordered subset of ''A''. Then
:&lt;math&gt;\{S\mid T\subseteq S\subseteq A\mbox{ and S totally ordered}\}&lt;/math&gt;
is partially ordered by set inclusion &lt;math&gt;\subseteq&lt;/math&gt;, therefore it contains a maximal totally ordered subset ''P''. Then the set &lt;math&gt;M=\bigcup P&lt;/math&gt; satisfies the desired properties.

The proof that the Hausdorff maximal principle is equivalent to Zorn's lemma is very similar to this proof.

== Examples ==
'''EXAMPLE 1.'''    If ''A'' is any collection of sets, the relation "is a proper subset of" is a [[strict partial order]] on ''A''. Suppose that ''A'' is the collection of all circular regions (interiors of circles) in the plane. One maximal totally ordered sub-collection of ''A'' consists of all circular regions with centers at the origin. Another maximal totally ordered sub-collection consists of all circular regions bounded by circles tangent from the right to the y-axis at the origin.

'''EXAMPLE 2.''' If (x&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, y&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;) and (x&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, y&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) are two points of the plane ℝ&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, define (x&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, y&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;) &lt; (x&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, y&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;)

if y&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; = y&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and x&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; &lt; x&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;. This is a partial ordering of ℝ&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; under which two points are comparable only if they lie on the same horizontal line. The maximal totally ordered sets are horizontal lines in ℝ&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.

In [[computer science]], '''higher-order abstract syntax''' (abbreviated '''HOAS''') is a technique for the representation of [[abstract syntax tree]]s for languages with variable [[name binding|binders]].

==Relation to first-order abstract syntax==

An abstract syntax tree is ''abstract'' because it is a [[mathematical object]] that has certain structure by its very nature. For instance, in ''[[first-order abstract syntax]]'' (''FOAS'') trees, as commonly used in [[compiler]]s, the tree structure implies the subexpression relation, meaning that no parentheses are required to disambiguate programs (as they are in the [[concrete syntax]]). HOAS exposes additional structure: the relationship between variables and their binding sites. In FOAS representations, a variable is typically represented with an identifier, with the relation between binding site and use being indicated by using the ''same'' identifier. With HOAS, there is no name for the variable; each use of the variable refers directly to the binding site.

There are a number of reasons why this technique is useful. First, it makes the binding structure of a program explicit: just as there is no need to explain operator precedence in a FOAS representation, there is no need to have the rules of binding and scope at hand to interpret a HOAS representation. Second, programs that are 
[[lambda calculus|alpha-equivalent]] (differing only in the names of bound variables) have identical representations in HOAS, which can make equivalence checking more efficient. &lt;!-- other uses? --&gt;

==Implementation==

One mathematical object that could be used to implement HOAS is a [[Graph (discrete mathematics)|graph]] where variables are associated with their binding sites via [[edge (graph theory)|edges]]. Another popular way to implement HOAS (in, for example, compilers) is with [[de Bruijn index|de Bruijn indices]].

==Use in logical frameworks==
In the domain of [[logical framework]]s, the term higher-order abstract syntax is usually used to refer to a specific representation that uses the binders of the [[metalanguage|meta-language]] to encode the binding structure of the [[object language]].

For instance, the logical framework [[LF (logical framework)|LF]] has a λ-construct, which has arrow
(→) type. A first-order encoding of an object language construct &lt;code&gt;let&lt;/code&gt; would be (using [[Twelf]]
syntax):

 exp : type.
 var : type.
 v : var -&gt; exp.
 let : exp -&gt; var -&gt; exp -&gt; exp.

Here, &lt;code&gt;exp&lt;/code&gt; is the family of object language expressions. The family &lt;code&gt;var&lt;/code&gt; is the representation of variables (implemented perhaps as natural numbers, which is not shown); the constant &lt;code&gt;v&lt;/code&gt; witnesses the fact that variables are expressions. The constant &lt;code&gt;let&lt;/code&gt; is an expression that takes three arguments: an expression (that is being bound), a variable (that it is bound to) and another expression (that the variable is bound within).

The [[canonical form|canonical]] HOAS representation of the same object language would be:

 exp : type.
 let : exp -&gt; (exp -&gt; exp) -&gt; exp.

In this representation, object level variables do not appear explicitly. The constant &lt;code&gt;let&lt;/code&gt; takes an expression (that is being bound) and a meta-level function &lt;code&gt;exp&lt;/code&gt; → &lt;code&gt;exp&lt;/code&gt; 
(the body of the let). This function is the ''higher-order'' part: an expression with a free variable is
represented as an expression with ''holes'' that are filled in by the meta-level function when applied. As a concrete example, we would construct the object level expression

 let x = 1 + 2
 in x + 3

(assuming the natural constructors for numbers and addition) using the HOAS signature above as

 let (plus 1 2) ([y] plus y 3)

where &lt;code&gt;[y] e&lt;/code&gt; is Twelf's syntax for the function &lt;math&gt;\lambda y.e&lt;/math&gt;.

This specific representation has advantages beyond the ones above: for one, by reusing the meta-level notion of binding, the encoding enjoys properties such as type-preserving ''substitution'' without the need to define/prove them. In this way using HOAS can drastically reduce the amount of [[boilerplate code]] having to do with binding in an encoding.

Higher-order abstract syntax is generally only applicable when object language variables can be understood as variables in the mathematical sense (that is, as stand-ins for arbitrary members of some domain). This is often, but not always, the case: for instance, there are no advantages to be gained from a HOAS encoding of [[scope (programming)#Dynamic scoping|dynamic scope]] as it appears in some dialects of [[Lisp programming language|Lisp]] because dynamically scoped variables do not act like mathematical variables.

In [[physics]], an '''infrared fixed point''' is a set of coupling constants, or other parameters that evolve from initial values at very high energies (short distance), to fixed stable values, usually predictable, at low energies (large distance). This usually involves the use of the [[renormalization group]], which specifically details the way parameters in a physical system (a [[quantum field theory]]) depend on the energy scale being probed.

Conversely, if the length-scale decreases and the physical parameters approach fixed values, then we have [[ultraviolet fixed point]]s.  The fixed points are generally independent of the initial values of the parameters over a large range of the initial values. This is known as [[Universality (dynamical systems)|universality]].

==Statistical physics==
In the [[statistical physics]] of second order [[phase transition]]s, the physical system approaches an infrared fixed point that is independent of the
initial short distance dynamics that defines the material. This determines the properties of the phase transition at the [[critical temperature]], or  [[critical point (thermodynamics)|critical point]]. Observables, such as [[critical exponents]] usually depend only upon dimension of space, and are independent of the atomic or molecular constituents.

==Top Quark==

===Standard Model===

There is a remarkable infrared fixed point of the coupling constants that determine the masses of very heavy quarks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pendleton|first1=B.|last2=Ross|first2=G.G.|title=Mass and Mixing Angle Predictions from Infrared Fixed points|journal=Phys.

These determine the mass of the particle. All of the quarks' and leptons' Yukawa couplings are small compared to the [[top quark]]'s Yukawa coupling. Yukawa couplings are not constants and their properties change depending on the energy scale at which they are measured, this is known as ''[[Renormalization group|running]]'' of the constants. The dynamics of Yukawa couplings are determined by the [[Exact renormalization group equation|renormalization group equation]]:

&lt;math&gt;\mu \frac{\partial}{\partial\mu} y  \approx \frac{y}{16\pi^2}\left(\frac{9}{2}y^2 - 8 g_3^2\right)&lt;/math&gt;,

where &lt;math&gt;g_3&lt;/math&gt; is the [[color charge|color]] [[gauge theory|gauge]] coupling (which is a function of  &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; and associated with [[asymptotic freedom]])  and &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; is the Yukawa coupling. This equation describes how the Yukawa coupling changes with energy scale &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt;.

The Yukawa couplings of the up, down, charm, strange and bottom quarks, are small at the extremely high energy scale of [[Grand Unified Theory|grand unification]], &lt;math&gt; \mu \approx 10^{15} &lt;/math&gt; GeV.  Therefore, the &lt;math&gt;y^2&lt;/math&gt; term can be neglected in the above equation. Solving, we then find that &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;  is increased slightly at the low energy scales at which the quark masses are generated by the Higgs, &lt;math&gt; \mu \approx 100 &lt;/math&gt; GeV.

On the other hand, solutions to this equation for large initial values &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; cause the ''rhs'' to quickly approach zero {{when|date=February 2015}}. This locks &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; to the QCD coupling &lt;math&gt;g_3&lt;/math&gt; {{clarify|date=February 2015}}. This is known as a (quasi-infrared) fixed point of the renormalization group equation for the Yukawa coupling.  No matter what the initial starting value of the coupling is, if it is sufficiently large it will reach this fixed point value, and the corresponding quark mass is predicted.

The value of the fixed point is fairly precisely determined in the Standard Model, leading to a predicted [[top quark]] mass of 230 &amp;nbsp;GeV. If there is more than one Higgs doublet, the value will be reduced by [[Higgs mixing angle]] effects.  The observed top quark mass is slightly lower, about 171 GeV.

===Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model===

In the [[Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model|minimal supersymmetric extension of the Standard Model]] (MSSM), there are two Higgs doublets and the renormalization group equation for the top quark Yukawa coupling is slightly modified. This leads to a fixed point where the top mass is smaller, 170–200&amp;nbsp;GeV. Some theorists believe this is supporting evidence for the MSSM.

The  "quasi-infrared fixed point" was proposed in 1981 by [[C. T. Hill]], B. Pendleton and G. G. Ross. The prevailing view at the time was that the top quark mass would lie in a range of 15 to 26 GeV. The quasi-infrared fixed point has formed the basis of [[top quark condensation]] theories of electroweak symmetry breaking in which the Higgs boson is composite at ''extremely'' short distance scales, composed of a pair of top and anti-top quarks. Many authors have explored other aspects of infrared fixed points to understand the anticipated spectrum of Higgs bosons in multi-Higgs models.

==Banks-Zaks fixed point==

Another example of an infrared fixed point is the [[Banks-Zaks fixed point]] in which the coupling constant of a Yang-Mills theory evolves to a fixed value. The beta-function vanishes, and the theory possesses a symmetry known as [[conformal symmetry]].

[[Image:Ky-57.jpg|thumbnail|320px|A KY-57 on display at the [[National Cryptologic Museum]].]]
The  '''Speech Security Equipment (VINSON), TSEC/KY-57''', is a portable, tactical [[cryptography|cryptographic]] device in the [[VINSON]] family, designed to provide voice encryption for a range of military [[communication]] devices such as [[radio]] or [[telephone]].

The KY-57 was in use by NATO and its allies towards the end of the cold war.  The device itself was classified as a CCI (controlled cryptographic item) when it was unkeyed. The classification of the device was temporarily raised to the classification of the key when the device was keyed.  It was authorized for TOP SECRET information with the appropriate key.  It is no longer authorized for handling classified information, and it has been de facto, but not officially, declassified.  The details of its technical operation are still classified.  The first unit, serial number 001 is still in operation at the NSA.

The KY-57 can accept signal fades of up to 12 seconds without losing synchronization with the transmitting station. There are storage positions for 6 [[key (cryptography)|keys]]. Keys 1 to 5 are traffic encryption keys (TEK). Key 6 is a key encryption key (KEK) used for [[OTAR|over the air rekeying (OTAR)]] of the other 5 keys. Key 6 must be loaded manually using a [[fill device]] such as the [[AN/CYZ-10]].

In mathematics, the [[definite integral]]:

:&lt;math&gt;\int_a^b f(x)\, dx&lt;/math&gt;

is the area of the region in the ''xy''-plane bounded by the graph of ''f'', the ''x''-axis, and the lines ''x'' = ''a'' and ''x'' = ''b'', such that area above the ''x''-axis adds to the total, and that below the ''x''-axis subtracts from the total.

The [[fundamental theorem of calculus]] establishes the relationship between indefinite and definite integrals and introduces a technique for evaluating definite integrals.

If the interval is infinite the definite integral is called an ''improper integral'' and defined by using appropriate limiting procedures. for example:

:&lt;math&gt;\int_a^\infty f(x)\, dx=\lim_{b\to\infty}\left[\int_a^b f(x)\, dx\right]&lt;/math&gt;

A constant, such pi, that may be defined by the integral of an algebraic function over an algebraic domain is known as a [[Ring of periods|period]].

The following is a list of the most common definite [[Integral]]s. For a list of [[indefinite integral]]s see ''[[List of integrals|List of indefinite integrals]]''

In [[mathematics]], a [[linear operator]] &lt;math&gt;f: V\to V&lt;/math&gt; is called '''locally finite''' if the [[linear space|space]] &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; is the union of a family of finite-dimensional &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt;-[[invariant subspace]]s.

In other words, there exists a family &lt;math&gt;\{ V_i\vert i\in I\}&lt;/math&gt; of linear subspaces of &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt;,  such that we have the following:
* &lt;math&gt;\bigcup_{i\in I} V_i=V&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;(\forall i\in I) f[V_i]\subseteq V_i&lt;/math&gt;
* Each &lt;math&gt;V_i&lt;/math&gt; is finite-dimensional.

==Examples==
* Every linear operator on a finite-dimensional space is trivially locally finite.
* Every [[diagonalizable]] (i.e. there exists a [[Basis (linear algebra)|basis]] of &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; whose elements are all [[eigenvector]]s of &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt;) linear operator is locally finite, because it is the union of subspaces spanned by finitely many eigenvectors of &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt;.

No star polygons with fewer than 5 points exist, and the construction of a normal 5-pointed magic star turns out to be impossible. It can be proven that there exists no 4-pointed star that will satisfy the conditions here. The smallest examples of normal magic stars are therefore 6-pointed. Some examples are given below. Notice that for specific values of ''n'', the ''n''-pointed magic stars are also known as ''magic hexagram'' etc.

[[Image:Midpoint.svg|282px|thumb|The midpoint of the segment ({{mvar|x}}&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, {{mvar|y}}&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) to ({{mvar|x}}&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, {{mvar|y}}&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)]]

In [[geometry]], the '''midpoint''' is the middle [[point (geometry)|point]] of a [[line segment]]. It is [[Distance|equidistant]] from both endpoints, and it is the [[centroid]] both of the segment and of the endpoints. It [[Bisection|bisects]] the segment.

==Formulas==

The midpoint of a segment in ''n''-dimensional space whose endpoints are &lt;math&gt;A = (a_1, a_2, \dots , a_n)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; B = (b_1, b_2, \dots , b_n)&lt;/math&gt; is given by

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{A+B}{2}.&lt;/math&gt;

That is, the ''i''&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; coordinate of the midpoint (''i'' = 1, 2, ..., ''n'') is

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{a_i+b_i} 2.&lt;/math&gt;

==Construction==
Given two points of interest, finding the midpoint of the line segment they determine can be accomplished by a [[compass and straightedge construction]]. The midpoint of a line segment, embedded in a [[Plane (geometry)|plane]], can be located by first constructing a [[Lens (geometry)|lens]] using circular arcs of equal (and large enough) radii centered at the two endpoints, then connecting the cusps of the lens (the two points where the arcs intersect). The point where the line connecting the cusps intersects the segment is then the midpoint of the segment. It is more challenging to locate the midpoint using only a compass, but it is still possible according to the [[Mohr-Mascheroni theorem]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Midpoint.html|title=Wolfram mathworld|date=29 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geometric properties involving midpoints==
===Circle===

The midpoint of any [[diameter]] of a [[circle]] is the center of the circle.

Any line [[perpendicular]] to any [[chord (geometry)|chord]] of a circle and passing through its midpoint also passes through the circle's center.

The [[butterfly theorem]] states that, if ''M'' is the midpoint of a chord ''PQ'' of a circle, through which two other chords ''AB'' and ''CD'' are drawn, then ''AD'' and ''BC'' intersect chord ''PQ'' at ''X'' and ''Y'' respectively, such that ''M'' is the midpoint of ''XY''.

===Ellipse===

The midpoint of any segment which is an [[area]] [[bisection|bisector]] or [[perimeter]] bisector of an [[ellipse]] is the ellipse's center.

The ellipse's center is also the midpoint of a segment connecting the two [[focus (geometry)|foci]] of the ellipse.

===Hyperbola===

The midpoint of a segment connecting a [[hyperbola]]'s vertices is the center of the hyperbola.

===Triangle===

The [[bisection#Triangle|perpendicular bisector of a side]] of a [[triangle]] is the line that is perpendicular to that side and passes through its midpoint. The three perpendicular bisectors of a triangle's three sides intersect at the [[circumcenter]] (the center of the circle through the three vertices). 

The [[median (geometry)|median]] of a triangle's side passes through both the side's midpoint and the triangle's opposite [[vertex (geometry)|vertex]]. The three medians of a triangle intersect at the triangle's [[centroid]] (the point on which the triangle would balance if it were made of a thin sheet of uniform-density metal).

The [[nine-point center]] of a triangle lies at the midpoint between the circumcenter and the [[orthocenter]]. These points are all on the [[Euler line]].

A ''midsegment'' (or ''midline'') of a triangle is a line segment that joins the midpoints of two sides of the triangle. It is parallel to the third side and has a length equal to one half of that third side.

The [[medial triangle]] of a given triangle has vertices at the midpoints of the given triangle's sides, therefore its sides are the three midsegments of the given triangle. It shares the same centroid and medians with the given triangle. The [[perimeter]] of the medial triangle equals the [[semiperimeter]] (half the perimeter) of the original triangle, and its area is one quarter of the area of the original triangle. The [[orthocenter]] (intersection of the [[altitude]]s) of the medial triangle coincides with the [[circumcenter]] (center of the circle through the vertices) of the original triangle.

Every triangle has an [[inscribed figure|inscribed]] [[ellipse]], called its [[Steiner inellipse]], that is internally tangent to the triangle at the midpoints of all its sides. This ellipse is centered at the triangle's centroid, and it has the largest area of any ellipse inscribed in the triangle.

In a [[right triangle]], the circumcenter is the midpoint of the [[hypotenuse]].

In an [[isosceles triangle]], the median, [[Altitude (triangle)|altitude]], and perpendicular bisector from the [[base (geometry)|base]] side and the [[angle bisector]] of the [[Apex (geometry)|apex]] coincide with the Euler line and the [[axis of symmetry]], and these coinciding lines go through the midpoint of the base side.

===Quadrilateral===

The two [[Quadrilateral#Bimedians|bimedians]] of a [[Convex polygon|convex]] [[quadrilateral]] are the line segments that connect the midpoints of opposite sides, hence each bisecting two sides. The two bimedians and the line segment joining the midpoints of the diagonals are [[Concurrent lines|concurrent]] at (all intersect at)a point called the "vertex centroid", which is the midpoint of all three of these segments.&lt;ref name=Altshiller-Court&gt;Altshiller-Court, Nathan, ''College Geometry'', Dover Publ., 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|p.125}}

The four "maltitudes" of a convex quadrilateral are the perpendiculars to a side through the midpoint of the opposite side, hence bisecting the latter side. If the quadrilateral is [[Cyclic quadrilateral|cyclic]] (inscribed in a circle), these maltitudes all meet at a common point called the "anticenter".

[[Brahmagupta's theorem]] states that if a cyclic quadrilateral is [[Orthodiagonal quadrilateral|orthodiagonal]] (that is, has [[perpendicular]] [[diagonals]]), then the perpendicular to a side from the point of intersection of the diagonals always goes through the midpoint of the opposite side.

[[Varignon's theorem]] states that the midpoints of the sides of an arbitrary quadrilateral form the vertices of a [[parallelogram]], and if the quadrilateral is not self-intersecting then the area of the parallelogram is half  the area of the quadrilateral.

The [[Newton line]] is the line that connects the midpoints of the two diagonals in a convex quadrilateral that is not a parallelogram. The line segments connecting the midpoints of opposite sides of a convex quadrilateral intersect in a point that lies on the Newton line.

===General polygons===

A [[regular polygon]] has an [[inscribed circle]] which is [[tangent]] to each side of the polygon at its midpoint.

In a regular polygon with an even number of sides, the midpoint of a [[diagonal]] between opposite vertices is the polygon's center.

The [[midpoint-stretching polygon]] of a [[cyclic polygon]] {{mvar|P}} (a [[polygon]] whose vertices all fall on the same circle) is another cyclic polygon inscribed in the same circle, the polygon whose vertices are the midpoints of the [[circular arc]]s between the vertices of {{mvar|P}}.&lt;ref name="dhz"&gt;{{Citation |last=Ding |first=Jiu |last2=Hitt |first2=L.

The [[#Formulas|abovementioned]] formulas for the midpoint of a segment implicitly use the lengths of segments. However, in the generalization to [[affine geometry]], where segment lengths are not defined,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Fishback|first=W.T.|title=Projective and Euclidean Geometry|edition=2nd|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|year=1969|page=214|isbn=0-471-26053-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; the midpoint can still be defined since it is an affine [[invariant (mathematics)|invariant]]. The [[Synthetic geometry|synthetic]] affine definition of the midpoint {{mvar|M}} of a segment {{mvar|AB}} is the [[projective harmonic conjugate]] of the [[point at infinity]], {{mvar|P}}, of the line {{mvar|AB}}. That is, the point {{mvar|M}} such that {{math|H[''A'',''B''; ''P'',''M'']}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Meserve|first=Bruce E.|title=Fundamental Concepts of Geometry|year=1983|origyear=1955|publisher=Dover|page=156|isbn=0-486-63415-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; When coordinates can be introduced in an affine geometry, the two definitions of midpoint will coincide.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Young|first=John Wesley|title=Projective Geometry|year=1930|publisher=Mathematical Association of America|series=Carus Mathematical Monographs #4|pages= 84-85}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The midpoint is not naturally defined in [[projective geometry]] since there is no distinguished point to play the role of the point at infinity (any point in a [[projective range]] may be projectively mapped to any other point in (the same or some other) projective range). However, fixing a point at infinity defines an affine structure on the [[projective line]] in question and the above definition can be applied. 

The definition of the midpoint of a segment may be extended to [[geodesic]] [[arc (geometry)|arcs]] on a [[Riemannian manifold]]. Note that, unlike in the affine case, the ''midpoint'' between two points may not be uniquely determined.

In [[mathematical physics]], '''noncommutative quantum field theory''' (or quantum field theory on noncommutative spacetime) is an application of noncommutative mathematics to the [[spacetime]] of [[quantum field theory]] that is an outgrowth of [[noncommutative geometry]] and [[index theory]] in which the coordinate functions  &lt;ref&gt;It is possible to have a noncommuting time coordinate as in the paper by Doplicher, Fredenhagen and Roberts mentioned below, but this causes many problems such as the violation of [[unitarity]] of the [[S-matrix]]. Hence most research is restricted to so-called "space-space" noncommutativity. There have been attempts to avoid these problems by redefining the [[perturbation theory (quantum mechanics)|perturbation theory]]. However, [[string theory]] derivations of noncommutative coordinates excludes time-space noncommutativity.&lt;/ref&gt; are [[noncommutative]]. One commonly studied version of such theories has the "canonical" commutation relation:
&lt;!--

--&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;
[x^{\mu}, x^{\nu}]=i \theta^{\mu \nu} \,\!
&lt;/math&gt;
which means that (with any given set of axes), it is impossible to accurately measure the position of a particle with respect to more than one axis. In fact, this leads to an uncertainty relation for the coordinates analogous to the [[Heisenberg uncertainty principle]].

Various lower limits have been claimed for the noncommutative scale, (i.e. how accurately positions can be measured) but there is currently no experimental evidence in favour of such a theory or grounds for ruling them out.

One of the novel features of noncommutative field theories is the [[UV/IR mixing]]&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, 
Shiraz Minwalla, Mark Van Raamsdonk, Nathan Seiberg (2000) "[https://arxiv.org/abs/hep-th/9912072 Noncommutative Perturbative Dynamics,]" ''Journal of High Energy Physics'', and Alec Matusis, [[Leonard Susskind]], Nicolaos Toumbas (2000) "[https://arxiv.org/abs/hep-th/0002075 The IR/UV Connection in the Non-Commutative Gauge Theories,]" ''Journal of High Energy Physics''.&lt;/ref&gt; phenomenon in which the physics at high energies affects the physics at low energies which does not occur in quantum field theories in which the coordinates commute.

Other features include violation of [[Lorentz invariance]] due to the preferred direction of noncommutativity. [[Relativistic invariance]] can however be retained in the sense of twisted [[Poincaré invariance]] of the theory.&lt;ref&gt;M. Chaichian, P. Prešnajder, A. Tureanu (2005)
"[https://arxiv.org/abs/hep-th/0409096 New concept of relativistic invariance in NC space-time: twisted Poincaré symmetry and its implications,]" ''Physical Review Letters'' 94: .&lt;/ref&gt; The [[causality conditions|causality condition]] is modified from that of the commutative theories.

==History and motivation==

[[Werner Heisenberg|Heisenberg]] was the first to suggest extending noncommutativity to the coordinates as a possible way of removing the infinite quantities appearing in field theories before the [[renormalization]] procedure was developed and had gained acceptance. The first paper on the subject was published in 1947 by [[Hartland Snyder]]. The success of the renormalization method resulted in little attention being paid to the subject for some time. In the 1980s, mathematicians, most notably [[Alain Connes]], developed [[noncommutative geometry]]. Among other things, this work generalized the notion of [[differential structure]] to a noncommutative setting. This led to an [[operator algebra]]ic description of noncommutative [[space-time]]s, with the problem that it classically corresponds to a manifold with positively defined [[metric tensor]], so that there is no description of (noncommutative) causality in this approach. However it also led to the development of a [[Yang–Mills theory]] on a noncommutative [[torus]].

The particle physics community became interested in the noncommutative approach because of a paper by [[Nathan Seiberg]] and [[Edward Witten]].&lt;ref&gt;Seiberg, N. and E. Witten (1999) "[https://arxiv.org/abs/hep-th/9908142 String Theory and Noncommutative Geometry,]" ''Journal of High Energy Physics'' .&lt;/ref&gt; They argued in the context of [[string theory]] that the coordinate functions of the endpoints of open strings constrained to a [[D-brane]] in the presence of a constant Neveu-Schwarz B-field—equivalent to a constant [[magnetic field]] on the brane—would satisfy the noncommutative algebra set out above. The implication is that a quantum field theory on noncommutative spacetime can be interpreted as a low energy limit of the theory of open strings.

Two papers, one by [[Sergio Doplicher]], Klaus Fredenhagen and John Roberts&lt;ref&gt;Sergio Doplicher, Klaus Fredenhagen, John E. Roberts (1995) "[https://arxiv.org/abs/hep-th/0303037 The quantum structure of spacetime at the Planck scale and quantum fields,]" ''Commun. Math. Phys''. 172: 187-220.&lt;/ref&gt; 
and the other by D. V. Ahluwalia,&lt;ref&gt;D. V. Ahluwalia (1993) "[https://arxiv.org/abs/gr-qc/9308007 Quantum Measurement, Gravitation, and Locality,]" ``Phys. Lett. B339:301-303,1994. A look at preprint dates shows that this work takes priority over Doplicher et al. publication by eight months&lt;/ref&gt;
set out another motivation for the possible noncommutativity of space-time. 
The arguments go as follows: According to [[general relativity]], when the energy density grows sufficiently large, a [[black hole]] is formed. On the other hand, according to the Heisenberg [[uncertainty principle]], a measurement of a space-time separation causes an uncertainty in momentum inversely proportional to the extent of the separation. Thus energy whose scale corresponds to the uncertainty in momentum is localized in the system within a region corresponding to the uncertainty in position. When the separation is small enough, the [[Schwarzschild radius]] of the system is reached and a [[black hole]] is formed, which prevents any information from escaping the system. Thus there is a lower bound for the measurement of length. A sufficient condition for preventing gravitational collapse can be expressed as an uncertainty relation for the coordinates. This relation can in turn be derived from a [[Commutativity|commutation]] relation for the coordinates.

It is worth stressing that, differently from other approaches, in particular those relying upon Connes' ideas, here the noncommutative spacetime is a proper spacetime, i.e. it extends the idea of a four-dimensional [[pseudo-Riemannian manifold]].   On the other hand, differently from Connes' noncommutative geometry, the proposed model turns out to be coordinates dependent from scratch.
In Doplicher Fredenhagen Roberts' paper noncommutativity of coordinates concerns all four spacetime coordinates and not only spatial ones.

In  [[calculus]], a '''one-sided limit''' is either of the two [[Limit of a function|limits]] of a [[function (mathematics)|function]] ''f''(''x'') of a [[real number|real]] variable ''x'' as ''x'' approaches a specified point either from below or from above.  One should write either:

:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{x\to a^+}f(x)\ &lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt; \lim_{x\downarrow a}\,f(x)&lt;/math&gt;  or &lt;math&gt; \lim_{x \searrow a}\,f(x)&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;\lim_{x \underset{&gt;}{\longrightarrow} a}f(x)&lt;/math&gt;

for the limit as ''x'' decreases in value approaching ''a'' (''x'' approaches ''a'' "from the right" or "from above"), and similarly

:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{x\to a^-}f(x)\ &lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt; \lim_{x\uparrow a}\, f(x)&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt; \lim_{x \nearrow a}\,f(x)&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;\lim_{x \underset{&lt;}{\longrightarrow} a}f(x)&lt;/math&gt;

for the limit as ''x'' increases in value approaching ''a'' (''x'' approaches ''a'' "from the left" or "from below"). In [[probability theory]] it is common to use the short notation
:&lt;math&gt;f(x-)&lt;/math&gt; for the left limit and &lt;math&gt;f(x+)&lt;/math&gt; for the right limit.

The two one-sided limits exist and are equal if the limit of ''f''(''x'') as ''x'' approaches ''a'' exists.  In some cases in which the limit

:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{x\to a} f(x)\,&lt;/math&gt;

does not exist, the two one-sided limits nonetheless exist.  Consequently, the limit as ''x'' approaches ''a'' is sometimes called a "two-sided limit".  In some cases one of the two one-sided limits exists and the other does not, and in some cases neither exists.

The right-sided limit can be rigorously defined as

:&lt;math&gt;\forall\varepsilon &gt; 0\;\exists \delta &gt;0 \;\forall x \in I \;(0 &lt; x - a &lt; \delta \Rightarrow |f(x) - L|&lt;\varepsilon),&lt;/math&gt;

and the left-sided limit can be rigorously defined as

:&lt;math&gt;\forall\varepsilon &gt; 0\;\exists \delta &gt;0 \;\forall x \in I \;(0 &lt; a - x &lt; \delta \Rightarrow |f(x) - L|&lt;\varepsilon),&lt;/math&gt;

where {{mvar|I}} represents some interval that is within the domain of {{mvar|f}}.

==Examples==

One example of a function with different one-sided limits is the following:

:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{x \to 0^+}{1 \over 1 + 2^{-1/x}} = 1,&lt;/math&gt;

whereas

:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{x \to 0^-}{1 \over 1 + 2^{-1/x}} = 0.&lt;/math&gt;

==Relation to topological definition of limit==
The one-sided limit to a point ''p'' corresponds to the [[Limit of a function#Functions on topological spaces|general definition of limit]], with the domain of the function restricted to one side, by either allowing that the function domain is a subset of the topological space, or by considering a one-sided subspace, including ''p''. Alternatively, one may consider the domain with a [[half-open interval topology]].

==Abel's theorem==
A noteworthy theorem treating one-sided limits of certain power series at the boundaries of their [[radius of convergence|intervals of convergence]] is [[Abel's theorem]].

The '''order polynomial''' is a [[polynomial]] studied in mathematics, in particular in [[algebraic graph theory]] and [[algebraic combinatorics]]. The order polynomial counts the number of order-preserving maps from a [[partially ordered set|poset]] to a [[total order|chain]] of length &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;.  These order-preserving maps were first introduced by [[Richard P. Stanley]] while studying ordered structures and partitions as a Ph.D. student at [[Harvard University]] in 1971 under the guidance of [[Gian-Carlo Rota]]. 

== Definition ==

Let &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; be a [[Finite set|finite]] [[partially ordered set|poset]], &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; be points in &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;[n]&lt;/math&gt; be a [[total order|chain]] of length &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;. A map &lt;math&gt; \phi: P \to [n] &lt;/math&gt; is order-preserving if &lt;math&gt; x \leq y&lt;/math&gt; implies &lt;math&gt;\phi(x) \leq \phi(y)&lt;/math&gt;. The number of such maps grows polynomially with &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;, and the function that counts their number as a function of &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; is the order polynomial &lt;math&gt;\Omega(n)&lt;/math&gt;.

Similarly, we can define an order polynomial that counts the number of [[strict]]ly order-preserving maps. A map &lt;math&gt; \phi: P \to [n]&lt;/math&gt; is strictly order-preserving if &lt;math&gt; x &lt; y&lt;/math&gt; implies &lt;math&gt;\phi(x) &lt; \phi(y)&lt;/math&gt;. The order polynomial that counts the number of these maps is denoted by &lt;math&gt;\Omega^\circ (n)&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Stanley|first1=Richard P.|title=Ordered structures and partitions|date=1972|publisher=American Mathematical Society|location=Providence, Rhode Island}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Examples == 

Let &lt;math&gt; P &lt;/math&gt; be a [[total order|chain]] of length &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;. Then &lt;math&gt;\Omega(n) = \binom{n+k-1}{k}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\Omega^\circ(n) = \binom{n}{k}.&lt;/math&gt;

We can also consider the poset &lt;math&gt; P &lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; disjoint points. Then the number of order-preserving maps to a [[total order|chain]] of length &lt;math&gt; n &lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;\Omega^\circ(n) = n^p&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;\Omega^\circ(n) = n^p &lt;/math&gt;. 

==Reciprocity theorem ==

The reciprocity theorem shows that there is a relation between strictly order-preserving maps and order-preserving maps. In addition, this comes hand in hand with important properties that the [[chromatic polynomial]] and [[Ehrhart polynomial]] share. The relation can be stated as follows:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Stanley |first1=Richard P. |title=A chromatic-like polynomial for ordered sets |date=1970 |journal=Proc. Second Chapel Hill Conference on Combinatorial Mathematics and Its Appl. |pages=421&amp;ndash;427}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\Omega^\circ(n) = (-1)^{|P|}\Omega(-n).&lt;/math&gt;
In the case that &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; is a chain, this recovers the [[Binomial coefficient#Generalization to negative integers|negative binomial identity]].

== Connections ==

===Chromatic polynomial ===

The [[chromatic polynomial]] counts the number of proper ways to color a [[graph (discrete mathematics)|graph]]. Let &lt;math&gt;G &lt;/math&gt; be a [[finite set|finite]] graph and let &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt; be an [[acyclic orientation]] of &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;. Then there is a natural [[binary relation]] on the [[Vertex (graph theory)|vertices]] &lt;math&gt; v,u &lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; defined as &lt;math&gt; u \geq v &lt;/math&gt; if &lt;math&gt;  u \rightarrow v &lt;/math&gt;. In particular, &lt;math&gt;\sigma &lt;/math&gt; is a [[partial ordering]] on the set of vertices &lt;math&gt;V(G) &lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;. In addition,  &lt;math&gt;\phi: V(G) \rightarrow \lbrace 1,2,3,\ldots,n \rbrace &lt;/math&gt; is compatible with &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt; if &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; is order-preserving. Then, we can conclude that 
:&lt;math&gt; P(G,n) = \sum_{\sigma} \Omega^\circ(n),&lt;/math&gt; 
where &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt; are all acyclic orientations of ''G''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Stanley|first1=Richard P.|title=Acyclic orientations of graphs|journal=Discrete Math|date=1973|volume=5|pages=171–178}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ehrhart polynomial ===
The [[Ehrhart polynomial]] is a polynomial that associates the number of [[integer lattice]] points and the expansion of a [[polytope]] &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; by a factor of &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;. In other words, consider the [[Lattice (group)|lattice]] &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; and a &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt;-dimensional polytope in &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^n&lt;/math&gt; with [[integer]] vertices. Let &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; be a positive integer, and &lt;math&gt;tP&lt;/math&gt; be a dilation of &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; so 
:&lt;math&gt;L(P,t) = \#(tP \cap L)&lt;/math&gt; 
is the number of lattice points in &lt;math&gt;tP&lt;/math&gt;. [[Eugène Ehrhart]] showed that this was a [[rational function|rational polynomial]] of degree &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Computing the continuous discretely |last=Beck |first=Matthias |last2=Robins |first2=Sinai |publisher=Springer |year=2015 |isbn=978-1-4939-2968-9 |location=New York |pages=64–72}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Order polytope===
The '''order polytope''' associates a [[polytope]] with a partial order. Let &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; be a poset with &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; elements. Then the order polytope, denoted &lt;math&gt;O(P)&lt;/math&gt;, is the set of points in the &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt;-dimensional [[unit cube]] such that the coordinates satisfy the partial order.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Alexander |last1=Karzanov |first2=Leonid |last2=Khachiyan |title=On the conductance of Order Markov Chains |journal=Order |volume=8 |pages=7&amp;ndash;15 |year=1991 |doi=10.1007/BF00385809}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Graham |last1=Brightwell |first2=Peter |last2=Winkler |title=Counting linear extensions |journal=Order |volume=8 |pages=225&amp;ndash;242 |year=1991 |doi=10.1007/BF00383444}}&lt;/ref&gt;

More formally, let &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^{|P|}&lt;/math&gt; be the set of all functions from &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt;. The order polytope &lt;math&gt;O(P)&lt;/math&gt; of the poset &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; is the set of all maps &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^{|P|}&lt;/math&gt; which satisfy the following two conditions. First, &lt;math&gt;0 \leq \phi(x) \leq 1&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;x \in P&lt;/math&gt;, and second, &lt;math&gt;f(x) \leq f(y)&lt;/math&gt; if &lt;math&gt;x \leq y&lt;/math&gt; in the ordering of &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt;. Thus, the polytope can be created given a poset and a partial order.&lt;ref name="Stanley1986"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Stanley|first=Richard P.|date=1986|title=Two poset polytopes|url=|journal=Discrete Comput.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11829">In [[theoretical computer science]] and [[formal language theory]], a '''regular tree grammar''' ('''RTG''') is a [[formal grammar]] that describes a set of [[Tree (graph theory)|directed trees]], or [[term (logic)|terms]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite paper | citeseerx=10.1.1.164.5484 | title = Regular tree grammars as a formalism for scope underspecification }}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[regular grammar|regular word grammar]] can be seen as a special kind of regular tree grammar, describing a set of single-[[Path (graph theory)|path]] trees.

==Definition==

A regular tree grammar ''G'' is defined by the tuple

''G'' = (''N'', Σ, ''Z'', ''P''),

where

* ''N'' is a finite set of nonterminals,
* Σ is a [[ranked alphabet]] (i.e., an alphabet whose symbols have an associated [[arity]]) disjoint from ''N'',
* ''Z'' is the starting nonterminal, with ''Z'' ∈ ''N'', and
* ''P'' is a finite set of productions of the form ''A'' → ''t'', with ''A'' ∈ ''N'', and ''t'' ∈ ''T''&lt;sub&gt;Σ&lt;/sub&gt;(''N''), where ''T''&lt;sub&gt;Σ&lt;/sub&gt;(''N'') is the associated [[term algebra]], i.e. the set of all trees composed from symbols in Σ ∪ ''N'' according to their arities, where nonterminals are considered nullary.

==Derivation of trees==
The grammar ''G'' implicitly defines a set of trees: any tree that can be derived from ''Z'' using the rule set ''P'' is said  to be '''described''' by ''G''.
This set of trees is known as the '''[[Formal language|language]]''' of ''G''.
More formally, the relation ⇒&lt;sub&gt;''G''&lt;/sub&gt; on the set ''T''&lt;sub&gt;Σ&lt;/sub&gt;(''N'') is defined as follows:

A tree ''t''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;∈ ''T''&lt;sub&gt;Σ&lt;/sub&gt;(''N'') can be '''derived in a single step''' into a tree ''t''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ∈ ''T''&lt;sub&gt;Σ&lt;/sub&gt;(''N'') 
(in short: ''t''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ⇒&lt;sub&gt;''G''&lt;/sub&gt; ''t''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), if there is a context ''S'' and a production (''A''→''t'') ∈ ''P'' such that:

* ''t''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = ''S''[''A''], and
* ''t''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = ''S''[''t''].

Here, a ''context'' means a tree with exactly one hole in it; if ''S'' is such a context, ''S''[''t''] denotes the result of filling the tree ''t'' into the hole of ''S''.

The tree language generated by ''G'' is the language ''L''(''G'') = { ''t'' ∈ ''T''&lt;sub&gt;Σ&lt;/sub&gt; | ''Z'' ⇒&lt;sub&gt;''G''*&lt;/sub&gt; ''t'' }.

Here, ''T''&lt;sub&gt;Σ&lt;/sub&gt; denotes the set of all trees composed from symbols of Σ, while ⇒&lt;sub&gt;''G''*&lt;/sub&gt; denotes successive applications of ⇒&lt;sub&gt;''G''&lt;/sub&gt;.

A language generated by some regular tree grammar is called a '''regular [[tree language]]'''.

==Examples==

[[File:Example derivation tree of a term from a regular tree grammar svg.svg|upright=2.5|thumb|Example [[derivation tree]] from G&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; in linear (upper left table) and graphical (main picture) notation]]

Let ''G''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = (''N''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,Σ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,''Z''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,''P''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;), where
* ''N''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = {''Bool'', ''BList'' } is our set of nonterminals,
* Σ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = { ''true'', ''false'', ''nil'', ''cons''(.,.) } is our ranked alphabet, arities indicated by dummy arguments (i.e. the symbol ''cons'' has arity 2),
* ''Z''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = ''BList'' is our starting nonterminal, and
* the set ''P''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; consists of the following productions:
** ''Bool'' → ''false''
** ''Bool'' → ''true''
** ''BList'' → ''nil''
** ''BList'' → ''cons''(''Bool'',''BList'')

An example derivation from the grammar ''G''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; is

''BList''
⇒ ''cons''(''Bool'',''BList'')
⇒ ''cons''(''false'',''cons''(''Bool'',''BList''))
⇒ ''cons''(''false'',''cons''(''true'',''nil'')).

The image shows the corresponding [[derivation tree]]; it is a tree of trees (main picture), whereas a derivation tree in [[regular grammar|word grammars]] is a tree of strings (upper left table).

The tree language generated by ''G''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; is the set of all finite lists of boolean values, that is, ''L''(''G''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) happens to equal ''T''&lt;sub&gt;Σ1&lt;/sub&gt;.
The grammar ''G''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; corresponds to the algebraic data type declarations (in the [[Standard ML#Algebraic datatypes and pattern matching|Standard ML]] programming language):

&lt;source lang="sml"&gt;
  datatype Bool
    = false
    | true
  datatype BList
    = nil
    | cons of Bool * BList
&lt;/source&gt;
Every member of ''L''(''G''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) corresponds to a Standard-ML value of type BList.

For another example, let ''G''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = (''N''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,Σ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,''BList1'',''P''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ∪ ''P''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), using the nonterminal set and the alphabet from above, but extending the production set by ''P''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, consisting of the following productions:
* ''BList1'' → ''cons''(''true'',''BList'')
* ''BList1'' → ''cons''(''false'',''BList1'')
The language ''L''(''G''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) is the set of all finite lists of boolean values that contain ''true'' at least once. The set ''L''(''G''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) has no '''datatype''' counterpart in Standard ML, nor in any other functional language.
It is a proper subset of ''L''(''G''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;).
The above example term happens to be in ''L''(''G''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), too, as the following  derivation shows:

''BList1''
⇒ ''cons''(''false'',''BList1'')
⇒ ''cons''(''false'',''cons''(''true'',''BList''))
⇒ ''cons''(''false'',''cons''(''true'',''nil'')).

==Language properties==

If ''L''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''L''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; both are regular tree languages, then the tree sets ''L''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ∩ ''L''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ''L''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ∪ ''L''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, and ''L''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; \ ''L''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; are also regular tree languages, and it is decidable whether ''L''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ⊆ ''L''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, and whether ''L''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = ''L''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.

==Alternative characterizations and relation to other formal languages==

*Regular tree grammars are a generalization of [[Regular grammar|regular word grammars]].
*The regular tree languages are also the languages recognized by bottom-up [[Tree automaton|tree automata]] and nondeterministic top-down tree automata.&lt;ref name=Comon&gt;{{cite web |last1=Comon |first1=Hubert |last2=Dauchet |first2=Max |last3=Gilleron |first3=Remi |last4=Löding |first4=Christof |last5=Jacquemard |first5=Florent |last6=Lugiez |first6=Denis |last7=Tison |first7=Sophie |last8=Tommasi |first8=Marc |date=12 October 2007 |title=Tree Automata Techniques and Applications |url=http://www.grappa.univ-lille3.fr/tata |accessdate=25 January 2016 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[mathematics]], '''symmetrization''' is a process that converts any function in ''n'' variables to a [[symmetric function]] in ''n'' variables.
Conversely, '''anti-symmetrization''' converts any function in ''n'' variables into an [[antisymmetric relation|antisymmetric]] function.

==Two variables==
Let &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; be a set and &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; an [[abelian group]]. Given a map &lt;math&gt;\alpha\colon S \times S \to A&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; is termed a symmetric map if &lt;math&gt;\alpha(s,t) = \alpha(t,s)&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;s,t \in S&lt;/math&gt;.

The '''symmetrization''' of a map &lt;math&gt;\alpha \colon S \times S \to A&lt;/math&gt; is the map &lt;math&gt;(x,y) \mapsto \alpha(x,y) + \alpha(y,x)&lt;/math&gt;.

Similarly, the '''anti-symmetrization''' or '''skew-symmetrization''' of a map &lt;math&gt;\alpha \colon S \times S \to A&lt;/math&gt; is the map &lt;math&gt;(x,y) \mapsto \alpha(x,y) - \alpha(y,x)&lt;/math&gt;.

The sum of the symmetrization and the anti-symmetrization of a map ''α'' is 2''α''.
Thus, [[Localization of a ring#Terminology|away from 2]], meaning if 2 is invertible, such as for the real numbers, one can divide by 2 and express every function as a sum of a symmetric function and an anti-symmetric function.

The symmetrization of a symmetric map is its double, while the symmetrization of an [[alternating map]] is zero; similarly, the anti-symmetrization of a symmetric map is zero, while the anti-symmetrization of an anti-symmetric map is its double.

===Bilinear forms===
The symmetrization and anti-symmetrization of a [[bilinear map]] are bilinear; thus away from 2, every bilinear form is a sum of a symmetric form and a skew-symmetric form, and there is no difference between a symmetric form and a quadratic form.

At 2, not every form can be decomposed into a symmetric form and a skew-symmetric form – for instance, over the integers, the associated symmetric form (over the rationals) may take half-integer values, while over &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{Z}/2\mathbf{Z},&lt;/math&gt; a function is skew-symmetric if and only if it is symmetric (as {{nowrap|1=1 = −1}}). 

This leads to the notion of [[e-quadratic form|ε-quadratic form]]s and ε-symmetric forms.

===Representation theory===
In terms of [[representation theory]]:
* exchanging variables gives a representation of the [[symmetric group]] on the space of functions in two variables,
* the symmetric and anti-symmetric functions are the [[subrepresentation]]s corresponding to the [[trivial representation]] and the [[sign representation]], and
* symmetrization and anti-symmetrization map a function into these subrepresentations – if one divides by 2, these yield [[projection map]]s.

As the symmetric group of order two equals the [[cyclic group]] of order two (&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{S}_2=\mathrm{C}_2&lt;/math&gt;), this corresponds to the [[discrete Fourier transform]] of order two.

==''n'' variables==
More generally, given a function in ''n'' variables, one can symmetrize by taking the sum over all &lt;math&gt;n!&lt;/math&gt; permutations of the variables,&lt;ref&gt;Hazewinkel (1990), [{{Google books|plainurl=y|id=kwMdtnhtUMMC|page=344|text=symmetrized}} p. 344]&lt;/ref&gt; or anti-symmetrize by taking the sum over all &lt;math&gt;n!/2&lt;/math&gt; [[even permutation]]s and subtracting the sum over all &lt;math&gt;n!/2&lt;/math&gt; odd permutations (except that when {{nowrap|''n'' ≤ 1}}, the only permutation is even).

Here symmetrizing (respectively anti-symmetrizing) a symmetric function multiplies by &lt;math&gt;n!&lt;/math&gt; – thus if &lt;math&gt;n!&lt;/math&gt; is invertible, such as when working a field of characteristic &lt;math&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;p &gt; n&lt;/math&gt; then these yield projections when divided by &lt;math&gt;n!&lt;/math&gt;.

In terms of representation theory, these only yield the subrepresentations corresponding to the trivial and sign representation, but for &lt;math&gt;n &gt; 2&lt;/math&gt; there are others – see [[representation theory of the symmetric group]] and [[symmetric polynomials]].

==Bootstrapping==
Given a function in ''k'' variables, one can obtain a symmetric function in ''n'' variables by taking the sum over ''k'' element subsets of the variables. In statistics, this is referred to as [[bootstrapping (statistics)|bootstrapping]], and the associated statistics are called [[U-statistics]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2401">'''T-theory''' is a branch of [[discrete mathematics]] dealing with analysis of [[tree (graph theory)|tree]]s and discrete [[metric spaces]]. 

==General history==
T-theory originated from a question raised by [[Manfred Eigen]] in the late 1970s. He was trying to fit twenty distinct [[transfer RNA|t-RNA]] [[molecule]]s of the ''[[Escherichia coli]]'' bacterium into a tree.

An important concept of T-theory is the [[tight span]] of a metric space. If ''X'' is a metric space, the tight span ''T''(''X'') of ''X'' is, up to isomorphism, the unique minimal [[injective metric space]] that contains ''X''. [[John Isbell]] was the first to discover the tight span in 1964, which he called the '''injective envelope'''. [[Andreas Dress]] independently constructed the same construct, which he called the tight span.

==Application areas==
* Phylogenetic analysis, which is used to create [[phylogenetic tree]]s.
* [[Online algorithm]]s - [[k-server problem | ''k''-server problem]]

==Recent developments==
* [[Bernd Sturmfels]], Professor of Mathematics and Computer Science at [[University of California, Berkeley | Berkeley]], and Josephine Yu classified six-point metrics using T-theory.

A '''transcriptor''' is a [[transistor]]-like device composed of [[DNA]] and [[RNA]] rather than a [[semiconducting material]] such as [[silicon]].  Prior to its invention in 2013, the transcriptor was considered an important component to build [[biocomputer|biological computers]].&lt;ref name=Extreme /&gt;

==Background==
To function, a modern [[computer]] needs three different capabilities:  It must be able to [[data storage device|store information]], transmit information between components, and possess a basic [[logic family|system of logic]].&lt;ref name=IO9 /&gt;  Prior to March 2013, scientists had successfully demonstrated the ability to store and transmit data using biological components made of proteins and [[DNA]].&lt;ref name=IO9&gt;{{cite news|title=This new discovery will finally allow us to build biological computers|author=Robert T. Gonzalez|work=IO9|date=March 29, 2013|url=http://io9.com/this-new-discovery-will-finally-allow-us-to-build-biolo-462867996|accessdate=March 29, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Simple two-terminal [[logic gate]]s had been demonstrated, but required multiple layers of inputs and thus were impractical due to scaling difficulties.&lt;ref name=paper&gt;{{cite journal|title=Amplifying Genetic Logic Gates|author=Jerome Bonnet|author2=Peter Yin|author3=Monica E. Ortiz|author4=Pakpoom Subsoontorn|author5=Drew Endy|work=Science|date=March 28, 2013|doi= 10.1126/science.1232758 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Invention and description==
On March 28, 2013, a team of [[bioengineer]]s from [[Stanford University]] led by [[Drew Endy]] announced that they had created the biological equivalent of a transistor, which they named a "transcriptor".  That is, they created a three-terminal device with a logic system that can control other components.&lt;ref name=IO9 /&gt;&lt;ref name=paper /&gt;  The transcriptor regulates the flow of [[RNA polymerase]] across a strand of DNA using special combinations of enzymes to control movement.&lt;ref name=Extreme&gt;{{cite news|title=Stanford creates biological transistors, the final step towards computers inside living cells|author=Sebastein Anthony|date=March 29, 2013|work=Extreme Tech|url=http://www.extremetech.com/extreme/152074-stanford-creates-biological-transistors-the-final-step-towards-computers-inside-living-cells|accessdate=March 29, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to project member Jerome Bonnet, "The choice of enzymes is important. We have been careful to select enzymes that function in bacteria, fungi, plants and animals, so that bio-computers can be engineered within a variety of organisms."&lt;ref name=Extreme /&gt; 

Transcriptors can replicate traditional [[AND gate|AND]], [[OR gate|OR]], [[NOR gate|NOR]], [[NAND gate|NAND]], [[XOR gate|XOR]], and [[XNOR gate]]s with equivalents, which Endy dubbed "Boolean Integrase Logic (BIL) gates", in a single-layer process (i.e., without requiring multiple instances of the simpler gates to build up more complex ones).&lt;ref name=IO9 /&gt;&lt;ref name=paper /&gt; Like a traditional transistor, a transcriptor can amplify an input signal.&lt;ref name=Extreme /&gt;  A group of transcriptors can do almost any type of computing, including counting and comparison.&lt;ref name=IO9 /&gt;&lt;ref name=SJMN /&gt;

==Impact==
Stanford dedicated the BIL gate's design to the [[public domain]], which may speed its adoption.&lt;ref name=Extreme /&gt;  According to Endy, other researchers were already using the gates to reprogram [[metabolism]] when the Stanford team published its research.&lt;ref name=SJMN /&gt;

Computing by transcriptor is still very slow; it can take a few hours between receiving an input signal and generating an output.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=How to Make a Computer From a Living Cell|author=Katherine Bourzac|work=MIT Technology Review|publisher=Mashable|date=March 28, 2013|url=http://mashable.com/2013/03/28/computer-from-living-cell/|accessdate=March 30, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Endy doubted that biocomputers would ever be as fast as traditional computers, but added that is not the goal of his research.  "We're building computers that will operate in a place where your cellphone isn't going to work", he said.&lt;ref name=IO9 /&gt;  Medical devices with built-in biological computers could monitor, or even alter, cell behavior from inside a patient's body.&lt;ref name=Extreme /&gt;  ''[[ExtremeTech]]'' writes:
{{quote|Moving forward, though, the potential for real biological computers is immense. We are essentially talking about {{Sic|hide=y|fully|-}}functional computers that can sense their surroundings, and then manipulate their host cells into doing just about anything.

Biological computers could tell their host cells to stop producing insulin, to pump out more adrenaline, to reproduce some healthy cells to combat disease, or to stop reproducing if cancer is detected. Biological computers will probably obviate the use of many pharmaceutical drugs.&lt;ref name=Extreme /&gt;}}

[[University of California, Berkeley|UC Berkeley]] biochemical engineer [[Jay Keasling]] said the transcriptor "clearly demonstrates the power of synthetic biology and could revolutionize how we compute in the future".&lt;ref name=SJMN&gt;{{cite news|title=Biological computer created at Stanford|work=San Jose  Mercury News|date=March 29, 2013|author=Lisa M.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7181">The '''Vaught conjecture''' is a [[conjecture]] in the mathematical field of [[model theory]] originally proposed by [[Robert Lawson Vaught]] in 1961.  It states that the  number of countable models of a first-order complete theory in a countable language is finite or ℵ&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; or 2{{sup|ℵ&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}}.  Morley showed that number of countable models is finite or ℵ&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; or ℵ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; or 2{{sup|ℵ&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}}, which solves the conjecture except for the case of ℵ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; models when the continuum hypothesis fails. For this remaining case,  {{harvs|txt|first=Robin |last=Knight|year1=2002|year2=2007}} has announced a counterexample to the Vaught conjecture and the topological Vaught conjecture. As of 2016 the counterexample has not been verified.

==Statement of the conjecture==
Let &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; be a first-order, countable, complete theory with infinite models.  Let &lt;math&gt;I(T, \alpha)&lt;/math&gt; denote the number of models of T of cardinality &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; up to isomorphism, the [[spectrum of a theory|spectrum]] of the theory &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt;.  Morley proved that if I(T,ℵ&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;) is infinite then it must be ℵ&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; or ℵ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; or the cardinality of the continuum. The Vaught conjecture is the statement that it is not possible for &lt;math&gt;\aleph_{0} &lt; I(T,\aleph_{0}) &lt; 2^{\aleph_{0}}&lt;/math&gt;. The conjecture is a trivial consequence of the [[continuum hypothesis]]; so this axiom is often excluded in work on the conjecture. Alternatively there is a sharper form of the conjecture which states that any countable complete T with uncountably many countable models will have a perfect set of uncountable models (as pointed out by John Steel, in On Vaught's conjecture. Cabal Seminar 76—77 (Proc. Caltech-UCLA Logic Sem., 1976—77), pp.&amp;nbsp;193–208, Lecture Notes in Math., 689, Springer, Berlin, 1978, this form of the Vaught conjecture is equiprovable with the original).

===Original formulation===
The original formulation by Vaught was not stated as a conjecture, but as a problem: ''Can it  be proved, without the use of the continuum hypothesis, that there exists a complete theory having exactly ℵ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; non-isomorphic denumerable  models?'' By the result by Morley mentioned at the beginning, a positive solution to the conjecture essentially corresponds to a negative answer to Vaught's problem as originally stated.

==Vaught's theorem==

Vaught proved that the number of countable models of a complete theory cannot be 2. It can be any finite number other than 2, for example:
*Any complete theory with a finite model has no countable models.
*The theories with just one countable model are the [[Omega-categorical theory|ω-categorical theories]]. There are many examples of these, such as the theory of an infinite set.
*[[Andrzej Ehrenfeucht|Ehrenfeucht]] gave the following example of a theory with 3 countable models: the language has a relation ≥ and a countable number of constants ''c''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, ''c''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ...with axioms stating that ≥ is a dense unbounded total order, and ''c''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;&lt; ''c''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;''c''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;... The three models differ according to whether this sequence is unbounded, or converges, or is bounded but does not converge.
*Ehrenfeucht's example can be modified to give a theory with any finite number ''n''≥3 of model by adding ''n''&amp;minus;2 unary relations ''P''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; to the language, with axioms stating that for every ''x'' exactly one of the ''P''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; is true, the values of ''y'' for which ''P''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;(''y'') is true are dense, and ''P''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; is true for all ''c''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;. Then the models for which the sequence of elements ''c''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; converge to a limit ''c'' split into ''n''&amp;minus;2 cases depending on for which ''i'' the relation ''P''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;(''c'') is true.

The idea of the proof of Vaught's theorem is as follows. If there are at most countably many  countable models, then there is a smallest one: the [[atomic model (mathematical logic)|atomic model]], and a largest one, the [[saturated model]], which are different if there is more than one model. If they are different, the saturated model must realize  some ''n''-type omitted by the atomic model. Then one can show that an atomic model of the theory of structures realizing this ''n''-type (in a language expanded by finitely many constants) is a third model, not isomorphic to either the atomic or the saturated model. In the example above with 3 models, the atomic model is the one where the sequence is unbounded, the saturated model is the one where the sequence does not converge, and an example of a type not realized by the atomic model is an element greater than all elements of the sequence.

==Topological Vaught conjecture==

The topological Vaught conjecture is the statement that whenever a Polish group acts continuously on a Polish space, there are either countably many orbits or continuum many orbits. The topological Vaught conjecture is more general than the original Vaught conjecture: Given a countable language we can form the space of all structures on the natural numbers for that language. If we equip this with the topology generated by first order formulas, then it is known from [[Andrzej Grzegorczyk|A. Gregorczyk]], A. Mostowski, C. Ryll-Nardzewski, "Definability of sets of models of axiomatic theories", Bulletin of the Polish Academy of Sciences (series Mathematics, Astronomy, Physics), vol. 9(1961), pp.&amp;nbsp;163–7 that the resulting space is Polish. There is a continuous action of the infinite symmetric group (the collection of all permutations of the natural numbers with the topology of point wise convergence) which gives rise to the equivalence relation of isomorphism. Given a complete first order theory T, the set of structures satisfying T is a minimal, closed invariant set, and hence Polish in its own right.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13814">A '''virtual fixture''' is an overlay of augmented sensory information upon a user's perception of a real environment in order to improve human performance in both direct and [[telerobotics|remotely manipulated]] tasks. Developed in the early 1990s by [[Louis B. Rosenberg|Louis Rosenberg]] at the [[Air Force Research Laboratory|U.S. Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL)]], Virtual Fixtures was a pioneering platform in [[virtual reality]] and [[augmented reality]] technologies.

==History==
[[File:Louis Rosenberg Augmented Reality Rig.png|thumb|right|Louis Rosenberg testing [[Virtual Fixtures]], one of the first augmented reality systems ever developed (1992)]]
Virtual Fixtures was first developed by [[Louis B.

To create the immersive experience for the user, a unique optics configuration was employed that involved a pair of binocular magnifiers aligned so that the user's view of the robot arms were brought forward so as to appear registered in the exact location of the user's real physical arms.&lt;ref name="B.

The system also employed computer-generated virtual overlays in the form of simulated physical barriers, fields, and guides, designed to assist in the user while performing real physical tasks.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Rosenberg, "Virtual Haptic Overlays Enhance Performance in Telepresence Tasks," Dept. of Mech.

[[Fitts Law]] performance testing was conducted on batteries of human test subjects, demonstrating for the first time, that a significant enhancement in human performance of real-world dexterous tasks could be achieved by providing immersive augmented reality overlays to users.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rosenberg|first1=Louis|title=The use of Virtual Fixtures to Enhance Operator Performance in Time Delayed Teleoperation.|date=March 1993|url=http://www.dtic.mil/cgi-bin/GetTRDoc?Location=U2&amp;doc=GetTRDoc.pdf&amp;AD=ADA296363}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rosenberg|first=Louis B.|title=Virtual fixtures as tools to enhance operator performance in telepresence environments|url=http://spie.org/Publications/Proceedings/Paper/10.1117/12.164901|journal=Telemanipulator Technology and Space Telerobotics|doi=10.1117/12.164901}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Concept ==
[[File:Conceptual fixture pic sm 2.jpg|alt=Virtual Fixtures, as conceptualized in 1992 system|thumb|Virtual fixtures were used by Rosenberg (1992) to enhance operator performance in the telerobotic control of Fitt's Law peg-board task.]]
The concept of virtual fixtures was first introduced by Rosenberg (1992)&lt;ref name="B. Rosenberg 1992" /&gt; as an overlay of virtual sensory information on a workspace in order to improve human performance in direct and remotely manipulated tasks.  The virtual sensory overlays can be presented as physically realistic structures, registered in space such that they are perceived by the user to be fully present in the real workspace environment. The virtual sensory overlays can also be abstractions that have properties not possible of real physical structures. The concept of sensory overlays is difficult to visualize and talk about, as a consequence the virtual fixture metaphor was introduced. To understand what a virtual fixture is an analogy with a real physical fixture such as a ruler is often used. A simple task such as drawing a straight line on a piece of paper free-hand is a task that most humans are unable to perform with good accuracy and high speed. However, the use of a simple device such as a ruler allows the task to be carried out quickly and with good accuracy. The use of a ruler helps the user by guiding the pen along the ruler reducing the tremor and mental load of the user, thus increasing the quality of the results.

The definition of virtual fixtures by Rosenberg&lt;ref name="B. Rosenberg 1992" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; is much broader than simply providing guidance of the end-effector. For example, auditory virtual fixtures are used to increase the user awareness by providing audio clues that helps the user by providing multi modal cues for localization of the end-effector. Rosenberg argues that the success of virtual fixtures is not only because the user is guided by the fixture, but that the user experiences a greater presence and better localization in the remote workspace. However, in the context of  human-machine collaborative systems, the term virtual fixtures is often used to refer to a task dependent virtual aid that is overlaid upon a real environment and guides the user's motion along desired directions while preventing motion in undesired directions or regions of the workspace. This is the type of virtual fixtures that is described in detail in the next section of this article.

Virtual fixtures can be either ''guiding virtual fixtures'' or  ''forbidden regions virtual fixtures''. A forbidden regions virtual fixture could be used, for example, in a [[teleoperation|teleoperated]] setting where the operator has to drive a vehicle at a remote site to accomplish an objective. If there are pits at the remote site which would be harmful for the vehicle to fall into forbidden regions could be defined at the various pits locations, thus preventing the operator from issuing commands that would result in the vehicle ending up in such a pit.

Such illegal commands could easily be sent by an operator because of, for instance, delays in the [[teleoperation]] loop, poor [[telepresence]] or a number of other reasons.

An example of a guiding virtual fixture could be when the vehicle must follow a certain trajectory,

The operator is then able to control the progress along the ''preferred direction'' while motion along the ''non-preferred direction'' is constrained.

With both forbidden regions and guiding virtual fixtures the ''stiffness'', or its inverse the ''compliance'', of the fixture can be adjusted. If the compliance is high (low stiffness) the fixture is ''soft''. On the other hand, when the compliance is zero (maximum stiffness) the fixture is ''hard''.

soft or hard. A hard fixture completely constrains the motion to the fixture while a softer 
fixture allows some deviations from the fixture.]]

== Virtual fixture control law ==
This section describes how a control law that implements virtual fixtures can be derived. It is assumed that the robot is a purely kinematic device with end-effector position &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{p} = \left[ x,y,z \right]&lt;/math&gt; and end-effector orientation &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{r} = \left[ r_\textrm{x}, r_\textrm{y}, r_\textrm{z} \right]&lt;/math&gt; expressed in the robot's base frame &lt;math&gt;F_\textrm{r}&lt;/math&gt;.  The input control signal &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{u}&lt;/math&gt; to the robot is assumed to be a desired end-effector velocity &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{v} = \dot{\mathbf{x}} = \left[ \dot{\mathbf{p}}, \dot{\mathbf{r}} \right]&lt;/math&gt;.  In a tele-operated system it is often useful to scale the input velocity from the operator, &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{v}_\textrm{op}&lt;/math&gt; before feeding it to the robot controller. If the input from the user is of another form such as a force or position it must first be transformed to an input velocity, by for example scaling or differentiating.

Thus the control signal &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{u}&lt;/math&gt; would be computed from the operator's input velocity &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{v}_\textrm{op}&lt;/math&gt; as:
 &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{u} = c \cdot \mathbf{v}_\textrm{op}&lt;/math&gt;
If &lt;math&gt;c=1&lt;/math&gt; there exists a one-to-one mapping between the operator and the slave robot.

If the constant &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; is replaced by a diagonal matrix &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{C}&lt;/math&gt; it is
possible to adjust the compliance independently for different
dimensions of &lt;math&gt;\dot{\mathbf{x}}&lt;/math&gt;. For example, setting the first three
elements on the diagonal of &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{C}&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; and all other elements to zero
would result in a system that only permits translational motion and not
rotation. This would be an example of a hard virtual fixture that
constrains the motion from &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{x} \in \mathbb{R}^6&lt;/math&gt; to 
&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{p} \in \mathbb{R}^3&lt;/math&gt;. If the rest of the elements on the
diagonal were set to a small value, instead of zero, the fixture
would be soft, allowing some motion in the rotational directions.

To express more general constraints assume a time-varying matrix 
&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{D}(t) \in \mathbb{R}^{6 \times n},~ n \in [1..6]&lt;/math&gt;
which represents the preferred direction at time &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;. Thus if &lt;math&gt;n=1&lt;/math&gt; the
preferred direction is along a curve in &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^{6}&lt;/math&gt;. Likewise,
&lt;math&gt;n=2&lt;/math&gt; would give preferred directions that span a surface. From &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{D}&lt;/math&gt; two
projection operators can be defined (Marayong ''et al.'', 2003), the
span and kernel of the column space:
 &lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\textrm{Span}(\mathbf{D}) &amp; \equiv \left[ \mathbf{D} \right] = 
\mathbf{D}(\mathbf{D}^T\mathbf{D})^{-1}\mathbf{D}^T \\
\textrm{Kernel}(\mathbf{D}) &amp; \equiv \langle \mathbf{D} \rangle = \mathbf{I} - \left[ \mathbf{D} \right]
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

If &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{D}&lt;/math&gt; does not have full column rank the span can not be computed,
consequently it is better to compute the span by using the
pseudo-inverse (Marayong ''et al.'', 2003), thus in practice the span is computed as:
 &lt;math&gt;
\textrm{Span}(\mathbf{D}) \equiv \left[ \mathbf{D} \right] = \mathbf{D}(\mathbf{D}^T\mathbf{D})^{\dagger}\mathbf{D}^T
&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{D}^\dagger&lt;/math&gt; denotes the pseudo-inverse of &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{D}&lt;/math&gt;.

If the input velocity is split into two components as:
 &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{v}_\textrm{D} \equiv \left[ \mathbf{D} \right]
\mathbf{v}_\textrm{op} \textrm{~and~} \mathbf{v}_\tau \equiv
\mathbf{v}_\textrm{op} -  \mathbf{v}_\textrm{D} = \langle \mathbf{D} \rangle
\mathbf{v}_\textrm{op}
&lt;/math&gt;
it is possible to rewrite the control law as:
 &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{v} = c \cdot \mathbf{v}_\textrm{op} = c \left( \mathbf{v}_\textrm{D} +
\mathbf{v}_\tau \right)
&lt;/math&gt;

Next introduce a new compliance that affects only the non-preferred
component of the velocity input and write the final control law as:
 &lt;math&gt;
\mathbf{v} = c \left( \mathbf{v}_\textrm{D} +
c_\tau \cdot \mathbf{v}_\tau \right) = 
c \left( \left[ \mathbf{D} \right] + c_\tau \langle \mathbf{D} \rangle \right)
\mathbf{v}_\textrm{op}
&lt;/math&gt;
