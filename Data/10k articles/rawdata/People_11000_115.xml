'''Benjamin Alfred Haldane''' (1874-1941) was a [[Tsimshian]] professional photographer from [[Metlakatla, Alaska]].&lt;ref name=burke&gt;[http://www.washington.edu/burkemuseum/inthespirit/our_artwork.php In the Spirit of the Ancestors.] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080829153559/http://www.washington.edu/burkemuseum/inthespirit/our_artwork.php |date=2008-08-29 }} ''Burke Museum.'' 2007 (retrieved 15 July 2009)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Benjamin Alfred Haldane was born on 15 June 1874 in the village of [[Metlakatla, British Columbia]].

He was a full-blood member of the Tsimshian tribe, a [[First Nations]] people spanning [[British Columbia]] and Alaska.&lt;ref&gt;[https://docs.google.com/gview?a=vq=cache:EZd2UXbLQo0J:www.bcarchives.bc.ca/Content_Files/Files/DanrevisedEarlyPhotographersSeptember.pdf+Benjamin+Haldane&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=us Early Photographers of First Peoples in British Columbia: 1850-1930.] Page 1 (retrieved through Google Docs, 15.July.2009)&lt;/ref&gt; At the age of 13, Haldane migrated to the village of Metlakatla, Alaska, located on [[Annette Island]], along with 800 other Tsimshian people. They made the 30-mile journey by canoe, seeking secure land rights and religious freedom with the missionary [[William Duncan (missionary)|William Duncan]].&lt;ref name=tp&gt;Tsinhnahjinnie and Passalacqua, 2&lt;/ref&gt;

Haldane's parents were Matthias (Matthew) Haldane and Caroline Auriol. Haldane married his first wife, Martha Calvert, on 17 November 1896, and together the couple had 11 children. Martha died in 1918. Haldane married again before 1938 to his second wife, Margaret.

He was a successful merchant and grocer, who served as his village's secretary for 35 years. In 1903, Haldane began teaching music and was respected for his musical abilities throughout southeast Alaska. For 38 years, he was the organist and choir master at the William Duncan Memorial Church and led the Metlakatla Concert Band.

==Art career==

Haldane took up photography in the late 19th century, as did his brother Henry Haldane and Thomas Eaton, also Tsimshian.&lt;ref&gt;Hoxie, Frederick E.

He maintained his studio and actively documented the people of his community from the 1890s to approximately 1910.&lt;ref&gt;Dutton, Lee S.

November–December 2006: 1. (retrieved 15 July 2009)&lt;/ref&gt; or concerts by his marching band. As a community insider, he was able to achieve an intimate look at the Tsimshian people. He was also able to photograph [[potlatch]]es, outlawed at the time, along the [[Nass River]].&lt;ref name=tp/&gt;

==Legacy==
Haldane died on 21 November 1941 from [[pulmonary tuberculosis]]. He is buried in Ocean View Cemetery in Metlakatla.

His photographs have been increasingly exhibited in recent decades. This revived interest in his work was sparked by Dennis Dunne, who rescued 162 original glass plate negatives of Haldane's photographs from the dump on Annette Island in the 1990s.&lt;ref name=thm/&gt;

The Tongass Historical Museum curated ''Metlakatla: Vintage Photographs'' in 2006, which featured 36 of prints of his photographs.&lt;ref name=thm/&gt; Also in 2006, his work was included in ''Our People, Our Land, Our Images'', an exhibition of indigenous photographers at the C. N. Gorman Museum at the [[University of California, Davis]], curated by [[Hulleah Tsinhnahjinnie]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20120712042001/http://google.com/search?q=cache:smJv4aBNKqEJ:gormanmuseum.ucdavis.edu/Exhibitions/Previous/IPC/confschedule.pdf+Benjamin+Haldane&amp;cd=12&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;gl=us&amp;client=firefox-a "Our People, Our Land, Our Images."] ''Gorman Museum, UC Davis.'' 2006 (retrieved 15 July 2009)&lt;/ref&gt; That shows also traveled to the [[Burke Museum of Natural History and Culture]] in [[Seattle, Washington]]. in 2007.&lt;ref name=burke/&gt;

[[Brigadier General]] '''Charles FitzClarence''' {{small|[[Victoria Cross|VC]]}} (8 May 1865 – 12 November 1914) was an [[Anglo-Irish]] recipient of the [[Victoria Cross]], the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to [[United Kingdom|British]] and [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] forces.

==Early life==
Charles FitzClarence was born in [[County Kildare]], the son of Captain George FitzClarence (15 April 1836 – 24 March 1894) and Maria Henrietta Scott (1841 – 27 July 1912). He had a twin brother named Edward. His paternal grandfather was [[George FitzClarence, 1st Earl of Munster|The 1st Earl of Munster]], an illegitimate son of [[William IV of the United Kingdom|William, Duke of Clarence]] (later King William IV of the United Kingdom).  He joined the [[Royal Fusiliers]] in 1886 but his early career was blighted by several bouts of illness and he spent much of his time in administrative and staff roles.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Stemming the Tide: Officers and Leadership in the British Expeditionary Force, 1914|last=Jones|first=Spencer|publisher=Helion &amp; Co|year=2013|isbn=978-1-909384-45-3|location=|pages=245|chapter="The Demon: Brigadier-General Charles FitzClarence VC}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1899 he volunteered to serve as a Special Service Officer at [[Siege of Mafeking|Mafeking]], South Africa and was given the duty of training a squadron of the [[Protectorate Regiment]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==The VC action==
FitzClarence was 34 years old, and a [[Captain (land and air)|captain]] in [[The Royal Fusiliers (City of London Regiment)|The Royal Fusiliers]], [[British Army]], during the [[Second Boer War]] when the following deeds took place for which he was awarded the [[Victoria Cross]]:
{{quote|On the 14th October, 1899, Captain FitzClarence went with his squadron of the [[Protectorate Regiment]], consisting of only partially trained men, who had never been in action, to the assistance of an armoured train which had gone out from Mafeking. The enemy were in greatly superior numbers, and the squadron was for a time surrounded, and it looked as if nothing could save them from being shot down. Captain FitzClarence, however, by his personal coolness and courage inspired the greatest confidence in his men, and, by his bold and efficient handling of them, not only succeeded in relieving the armoured train, but inflicted a heavy defeat on the Boers, who lost 50 killed and a large number wounded, his own losses being 2 killed and 15 wounded. The moral effect of this blow had a very important bearing on subsequent encounters with the Boers.
On the 27th October, 1899, Captain FitzClarence led his squadron from Mafeking across the open, and made a night attack with the bayonet on one of the enemy's trenches. A hand-to-hand fight took place in the trench, while a heavy fire was concentrated on it from the rear. The enemy was driven out with heavy loss. Captain FitzClarence was the first man into the position and accounted for four of the enemy with his sword. The British lost 6 killed and 9 wounded. Captain FitzClarence was himself slightly wounded. With reference to these two actions, Major-General Baden-Powell states that had this Officer not shown an extraordinary spirit and fearlessness the attacks would have been failures, and we should have suffered heavy loss both in men and prestige. 

On the 26th December, 1899, during the action at Game Tree, near Mafeking, Captain FitzClarence again distinguished himself by his coolness and courage, and was again wounded (severely through both legs).&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=27208|page=4196|date=6 July 1900}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

His ferocity in battle earned him the enduring nickname 'The Demon'.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; He served in South Africa until February 1901, at which point he transferred to the newly formed [[Irish Guards]]. He passed [[Royal Military Academy Sandhurst|Staff College]] in 1904 and succeeded to the command of the 1st Battalion [[Irish Guards]] in July 1909. He had a reputation as a forward thinking soldier and took an innovative, albeit demanding, approach to training. It was noted he was "both loved and feared by his battalion".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; At the outbreak of the First World War he was promoted to the rank of [[Brigadier General]] and was given command of the newly formed 29th Brigade.

== The Great War ==
On 27 September 1914 he replaced Brigadier-General [[Ivor Maxse]] as commander of 1st Guards' Brigade with the [[British Expeditionary Force (World War I)|British Expeditionary Force]]. He held this command until he was killed in action on 12 November 1914. 

On 4 October 1914, whilst 1st Guards' Brigade was holding trenches opposite the German line at the River Aisne, he ordered the [[Coldstream Guards]] to carry out a night time raid against a German position known as 'Fish Hook Trench'. This was the first British trench raid of the First World War. The raid was led by Second Lieutenant [[Merton Beckwith-Smith]] and was a striking local success.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 

In October, FitzClarence had played a significant part in the [[First Battle of Ypres]]. Captain [[Valentine Williams]], MC, writing in ''[[Blackwood's Magazine]]'', described the action at Gheluvelt thus: "The Coldstream and Scots Guards' battalions of FitzClarence's brigade, in trenches north of Gheluvelt, suffered terribly in a German attack, delivered in a dense mist on the morning of the 27th along the Menin road. The odds against the British were crushing, for on that day some 24,000 Germans were arrayed against about 5,000 exhausted British troops. In two days the Scots Guards lost 10 officers and 370 men killed and wounded. But the result of the day's fighting was that the British line stood firm and unbroken, while the Germans had sustained enormous losses". [[John French, 1st Earl of Ypres|Sir John French]], in his Despatch published on 30 November 1914, described the fighting at this time as: "Perhaps the most important and decisive attack (except that of the Prussian Guard on the 10th November) made against the 1st Corps during the whole of its arduous experiences in the neighbourhood of Ypres." 

''Blackwood's Magazine'' for August 1917 carries an article describing FitzClarence's part. It was he who gave the order for the vital counter-attack of 31 October 1914. He "rallied the troops and directed the successful onslaught". Lt Col. E. B. Hankey, involved in the attack, said of FitzClarence: " ... by shoving us in at the time and place he did, the General saved the day." 

On the morning of 12 November the Prussian Guard attacked British troops along the Menin Road. Thirteen battalions of them came on, but only in three places did the Prussian Guard break through. On the following morning FitzClarence counter-attacked. The General himself decided to show his old regiment the way, and paid for the decision with his life. FitzClarence fell dead, and neither FitzClarence himself, nor Sir John French knew how well he had served his country at Gheluvelt. 

In his Despatch of 20 November 1914, Sir John French said: "Another officer whose name was particularly mentioned to me was Brigadier-General FitzClarence, VC, commanding the 1st Guards' Brigade. He was unfortunately killed in the night attack of the 11th November. His loss will be severely felt".

His most recent biographer, Spencer Jones, describes FitzClarence as exemplifying "...the best aspects of the post-Boer War [British] officer class" due to his "courage, professionalism, natural leadership, and willingness to act upon his own initiative."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

He was [[killed in action]], aged 49, at [[Polygon Wood, Zonnebeke]], [[Belgium]], on 12 November 1914 whilst commanding the [[1st (Guards) Brigade]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cwgc|id=1612465|name=Charles FitzClarence|accessdate=15 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He is the highest-ranking officer inscribed on the [[Menin Gate]] Memorial in [[Ypres]], commemorating those with no known grave.

==The medal==
His VC is in the [[Lord Ashcroft VC Gallery]] in the [[Imperial War Museum]], London.

==Family==
On 20 April 1898, at the Citadel Church, Cairo, he married Violet Spencer-Churchill (13 June 1864 – 22 December 1941), daughter of [[Lord Alfred Spencer-Churchill]] and a granddaughter of the [[George Spencer-Churchill, 6th Duke of Marlborough|sixth Duke of Marlborough]]. The couple had two children:
* [[Edward FitzClarence, 6th Earl of Munster|Edward Charles FitzClarence, 6th Earl of Munster]] (3 October 1899 – 15 November 1983)
* Joan Harriet FitzClarence (23 December 1901 – 6 January 1971)

'''David-Zvi Pinkas''' ({{lang-he-n|דוד-צבי פנקס}}{{ltr}}, 5 December 1895 – 14 August 1952) was a [[Zionism|Zionist]] activist and [[Israel]]i politician. A signatory of the [[Declaration of Independence (Israel)|Israeli declaration of independence]], he was the country's third [[Transportation Minister of Israel|Minister of Transport]].

==Biography==
Born in [[Sopron]] in [[Austria-Hungary]] (today in [[Hungary]]), Pinkas attended high school in [[Vienna]], before studying at a [[yeshiva]] in [[Freiburg]] and law at the [[University of Vienna]]. He was involved in Zionist youth groups, and was one of the leaders of Young [[Mizrachi (Religious Zionism)|Mizrachi]] in Vienna and one of the founders of the [[Yeshuran]] movement.

In 1923 he was a delegate to the 13th Zionist congress, and two years later [[aliyah|immigrated]] to [[Mandatory Palestine|Mandate Palestine]]. He became director of [[Bank Mizrahi-Tfahot|Bank Mizrahi]] in 1932, the same year in which he was elected to [[Tel Aviv]] city council. Three years later he was appointed head of the city's education department.

==Political career==
In 1944 he became a member of the [[Assembly of Representatives (Mandate Palestine)|Assembly of Representatives]], and between 1947 and 1948 served as a member of the [[Jewish National Council]]'s directorate. In 1948 he was one of the people to sign the Israeli declaration of independence. During the subsequent [[1948 Arab-Israeli War|Arab-Israeli War]], he was one of the leaders of the security committee.
[[Image:Pinkas tomb.JPG|thumb|Pinkas' tomb (left, with his wife, Leah on the right) in [[Tel Aviv]]]]
Following independence, Pinkas assumed membership of the [[Provisional State Council]], and was responsible for drawing up the regulations for the council's committees. In Israel's [[Israeli legislative election, 1949|first elections]] in 1949 he was elected to the [[Knesset]] as a member of the [[United Religious Front]], an alliance of [[Agudat Yisrael]], [[Poalei Agudat Yisrael]], [[Mizrachi (political party)|Mizrachi]] (Pinkas' party) and [[Hapoel HaMizrachi]], and served as chairman of the influential finance committee. In 1950 he was also elected Deputy Mayor of Tel Aviv.

In the [[Israeli legislative election, 1951|1951 elections]] Mizrachi ran alone, and Pinkas retained his seat, though the party won only two mandates. He was appointed Minister of Transport, and remained chairman of the finance committee. In his role as minister, Pinkas stopped public transport from operating on [[Shabbat]].

==Death==
In June 1952, a bomb was left on his doorstep by [[Amos Kenan]] and Shaltiel Ben Yair.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/1099063.html Murder on Rothschild Boulevard] Haaretz, 16 July 2009&lt;/ref&gt; He was not harmed in the assassination attempt but died two months later of a heart attack. He is buried in the [[Trumpeldor Cemetery]] in Tel Aviv. [[Ramat Pinkas]] was named after him.

'''David Raziel''' ({{lang-he-n|דוד רזיאל}}; 19 November 1910 - 20 May 1941) was a leader of the [[Zionist political violence|Zionist underground]] in [[Mandatory Palestine|British Mandatory Palestine]] and one of the founders of the [[Irgun]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=David Raziel|url=http://www.etzel.org.il/english/people/raziel.htm|work=The Etzel Website|accessdate=7 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==

Born David Rozenson in [[Smarhon’]] (now in [[Grodno Region]], [[Belarus]]), [[Vilnius]] in the [[Russian Empire]], Raziel immigrated with his family in 1914 at the age of three to [[Ottoman Palestine]], when his father was invited to teach at Tachkemoni, a religious school in [[Tel Aviv]]. During [[World War I]], the family was exiled to Egypt by the Turks due to their Russian citizenship. They returned to [[Mandatory Palestine]] in 1923.

In 1928, Raziel completed studies at the Tachkemoni high school, and studied for several years at Yeshivat [[Mercaz HaRav]] in Jerusalem. He was regular study partner with Rabbi [[Zvi Yehuda Kook]], son and ideological successor to the [[Rosh Yeshiva]] and [[Chief Rabbi of Israel]], Rabbi [[Abraham Isaac Kook]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=HaKohen |first1=Yehuda |title=The tragic legacy of David Raziel, commander of the Etzel |url=https://www.israelnationalnews.com/Articles/Article.aspx/22121 |accessdate=16 August 2018 |publisher=Arutz Sheva |date=8 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

When the [[1929 Hebron massacre]] broke out, he joined the [[Haganah]] in [[Jerusalem]], where he was studying philosophy and mathematics at the [[Hebrew University of Jerusalem]]. When the Irgun was established, he was one of its first members, and displayed outstanding military skills. 

In 1937 he was appointed by the Irgun as the first Commander of Jerusalem District and a year later, ''Commander in Chief'' of the Irgun. His term as leader was especially marked by violence against Arabs, including a sequence of marketplace bombings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = Yehuda Bauer | title = From Diplomacy to Resistance: A History of Jewish Palestine, 1935–1945 | year = 2001 | publisher = Varda Books | page = 14 | quote = During the period of command over Etzel by Moshe Rosenberg and David Raziel, a great many assaults (some of them en masse) were carried out against Arab bystanders and shoppers: men, women, and children (November 1937-July 1939).}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of those attacks were in response to Arab violence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GTtFAV-fIEAC&amp;pg=PA38|title=The Stern Gang: Ideology, Politics and Terror, 1940-1949|last=Heller|first=Joseph|date=2012-12-06|publisher=Routledge|year=|isbn=9781136298943|location=|pages=|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Raziel worked with [[Avraham Stern]] and [[Efraim Ilin]].

On 17 May 1941 he was sent, with three of his comrades, including [[Ya'akov Meridor]], to [[Iraq]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Nir Mann|title=A life underground|url=http://www.haaretz.com/weekend/magazine/a-life-underground-1.284702|accessdate=7 December 2013|newspaper=Haaretz|date=April 22, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; on behalf of the British army to help defeat the [[Rashid Ali al-Gaylani]] [[Axis powers|pro-Axis]] revolt in the [[Anglo-Iraqi War]].

In 1955 his remains were [[Burial#Exhumation|exhumed]] and transferred to [[Cyprus]], and again in 1961 to Jerusalem's [[Mount Herzl]] military cemetery. His sister, [[Esther Raziel-Naor]], was later a member of the [[Knesset]] for [[Herut]], the party founded by Irgun leader [[Menachem Begin]].

==Commemoration==
[[Ramat Raziel]], a [[moshav]] in the [[Judaean Mountains]], is named after Raziel, as well as many streets in Israel bearing his name in commemoration. The Israel postal service issued a stamp in his honor. There is a high-school in [[Herzliya]] named after him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.boeliem.com/content/1978/227.html |publisher=Boeliem|work=The complete guide to Israeli postage stamps from 1948 onward|title=David Raziel}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Dr. Dahesh''' (in [[Arabic language|Arabic]] الدكتور داهش) (June 1, 1909, [[Jerusalem]] – April 9, 1984, [[New York City]]) was the name-title and [[pen name]] of '''Salim Moussa Achi''' (in [[Arabic language|Arabic]] سليم موسى عشّي) founder of '''[[Daheshism]]'''.

==Life==
''Salim Moussa Achi'' was born in [[Jerusalem]] on June 1, 1909, to [[Assyrian people|Assyrian Christian]] parents ''Moussa Elias Achi'' and ''Shmouneh Hanna Achi (née Hannouch)&lt;ref&gt;Süryani Beyt Zebdeden, 2000, Hanna Murad Hannouche.&lt;/ref&gt;''. Shortly after his birth the family moved to [[Beirut]], [[Lebanon]].&lt;ref&gt;Astarte, issue 5, September 2, 1947, by Pierre Rufayel.&lt;/ref&gt;

He was a prolific [[Lebanon (region)|Lebanese]] author and purported worker of [[miracle]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.onefineart.com/artists/poets-writers/Salim-Mousa-El-Achi OneFineArt: Biography of Dr. Dahesh]&lt;/ref&gt; By the age of 21, he had adopted the name ''Dahesh'', [[Arabic]] for "inspiring wonder".

Dr. Dahesh proclaimed Daheshism on March 23, 1942. The spiritual message of Daheshism can be summarized in a belief in the existence and immortality of the spirit; reincarnation; the intrinsic correlation between all the major religions; spiritual causality and just reward (i.e., karma). His publishing career included essays, poetry, short stories, novels, and an autobiography, and exceeded 150 works.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.daheshheritage.org/ Dahesh Heritage &amp; The Daheshist Publishing Co.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Dahesh was imprisoned on September 9, 1944&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.levrier-editions.com/Letter-from-Dahesh-to-his-Attorney-Noon.htm Letter from Dahesh to Noon, his Attorner at Law]&lt;/ref&gt; and later on stripped of his Lebanese [[nationality]] and exiled from Lebanon in 1944 during the reign of Lebanese President [[Bechara El Khoury]]. In 1953, Lebanon, the newly elected President [[Camille Chamoun]] restored his [[citizenship]].

Dr. Dahesh died in April 9, 1984, in [[New York City]].

==Art legacy==
Dahesh began collecting works of art around 1930 and continued to do so for the rest of his life.  Today, his art collection belongs to [[New York City]]'s [[Dahesh Museum of Art]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.daheshmuseum.org Dahesh Museum of Art website]&lt;/ref&gt;

He also formed the Dahesh Library, the largest private library in the Arab world, known for its literary, scientific, and artistic holdings, and for its periodical collections. The Dahesh Heritage Center, also includes the offices of the Daheshist Publishing Company, on Broadway, New York.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4478">'''Marie Sainte Dédée Bazile''' ({{floruit|1806}}), known as '''Défilée''' and '''Défilée-La-Folle''', is a figure of the [[Haitian Revolution]].  She is remembered for retrieving and burying the mutilated body of [[Jean-Jacques Dessalines|Emperor Dessalines]] after his assassination at Pont Larnage.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Braziel|first=Jana Evans|date=2005-10-05|title=Re-membering Défilée: Dédée Bazile as Revolutionary Lieu de Mémoire|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/187917|journal=Small Axe|volume=9|issue=2|pages=57–85|doi=10.1353/smx.2005.0014|issn=1534-6714}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Life ==
Dédée Bazile was born near [[Cap-Français]] to enslaved parents and made a living serving as a [[sutler]] to the army of Dessalines.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Braziel|first=Jana Evans|date=2005-10-05|title=Re-membering Défilée: Dédée Bazile as Revolutionary Lieu de Mémoire|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/187917|journal=Small Axe|volume=9|issue=2|pages=57–85|doi=10.1353/smx.2005.0014|issn=1534-6714}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are varying accounts of her madness but according to legend, Dédée Bazile either developed mental illness after she was raped by her master at age 18, or after some of her family members were killed in the defeat of Dessalines’s army by General Donatien Rochambeau.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Braziel|first=Jana Evans|date=2005-10-05|title=Re-membering Défilée: Dédée Bazile as Revolutionary Lieu de Mémoire|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/187917|journal=Small Axe|volume=9|issue=2|pages=57–85|doi=10.1353/smx.2005.0014|issn=1534-6714}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The Assassination of Dessalines ==
On October 17, 1806, Emperor Dessalines was ambushed by his former comrades [[Alexandre Pétion]], [[Jean-Pierre Boyer]], [[André Rigaud]], and Bruno Blanchet. He was fatally shot north of [[Port-au-Prince]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.haiticulture.ch/Defilee.html|title=Femmes d'Haiti : Défilée, Dédée Bazile|last=Webmaster|website=www.haiticulture.ch|access-date=2016-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; His body was then brought into the city where it was stoned and mutilated by the crowds.

"Pendant que de nombreux enfants, au milieu de grands cris de joie, criblaient de coups de pierre les restes infortunés de Dessalines, sur la place du Gouvernement, une vieille femme folle nommée Défilée vint à passer. Elle s'approcha de l'attroupement que formaient les enfants...On lui dit que c'était Dessalines. Ses yeux égarés devinrent calmes tout à coup; une lueur de raison brilla sur ses traits. Elle alla à la course chercher un sac, revint sur la place, y mit ses restes ensanglantés et les transporta au cimetière intérieur de la ville. [Port-au-Prince] Le général Pétion y envoya quelques militaires qui, pour une modique somme, les enterrèrent."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.jasminenarcisse.com/memoire/02_independance/02_defilee.html|title=Mémoire de femmes|website=www.jasminenarcisse.com|access-date=2016-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dédée Bazile, a fanatic admirer of Dessalines, gathered his remains in a sack and transported them to the Cimetière Intérieur to bury them.

== Legacy ==
Dédée Bazile died around 1816 and was buried in Port-au-Prince, but her grave has been lost.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Braziel|first=Jana Evans|date=2005-10-05|title=Re-membering Défilée: Dédée Bazile as Revolutionary Lieu de Mémoire|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/187917|journal=Small Axe|volume=9|issue=2|pages=57–85|doi=10.1353/smx.2005.0014|issn=1534-6714}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was survived by her several children including her son Colonel Condol Bazile, officer of the constabulary under the Haitian president [[Faustin Soulouque]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.jasminenarcisse.com/memoire/02_independance/02_defilee.html|title=Mémoire de femmes|website=www.jasminenarcisse.com|access-date=2016-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; She is considered one of the four symbolic heroines of the independence of Haiti, alongside [[Sanité Bélair]], [[Catherine Flon]], and [[Cécile Fatiman]].

'''Franciszek Ksawery Branicki''' (1730, [[Barwałd Górny]] – 1819) was a [[Poland|Polish]] [[szlachta|nobleman]], [[magnate]], count, diplomat, politician, military commander and one of the leaders of the [[Targowica Confederation]]. He was appointed the Great Crown [[Podstoli]] in 1764, Ambassador in Berlin in 1765, [[Master of the Hunt of the Crown]] in 1766–1773, Artillery General of Lithuania in 1768–1773, Ambassador in Moscow in 1771, Field Crown Hetman in 1773 and Great Crown [[Hetman]] of the [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth]] between 1774 and 1794.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wilanow-palac.pl/franciszek_ksawery_branicki_ok_1730_1819_awanturnik_i_zdrajca.html&lt;/ref&gt;

He opposed the reforms of the [[Great Sejm]] (1788–1792), and supported the [[Hetman Party]] and the Targowica Confederation. For his pro-Russian policies and controversial anti-nationalistic politics against the Commonwealth he was sentenced to hang; however, he escaped the death penalty and received ''in absentia'' from the Supreme Criminal Court during the [[Kościuszko Uprising]] (1794).

Branicki was awarded the [[Order of the White Eagle (Poland)|Order of the White Eagle]] in December 1764. He married [[Aleksandra von Engelhardt]], a niece of [[Prince Potemkin]], in 1781.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wilanow-palac.pl/franciszek_ksawery_branicki_ok_1730_1819_awanturnik_i_zdrajca.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Franciszek Ksawery was the son of Piotr Branicki, [[Chorąży]] of Halicz, and Melania Teresa Szembek, the chatelaine of [[Oświęcim]]. He started his career as a soldier in the [[Seven Years' War]], firstly in the Russian Imperial army and later in the French. He distinguished himself at the battle of Sarbinowo (Zorndorf) in 1758 while commanding a squadron of Russian cavalry. For his services in the French army [[Louis XV]] awarded him the title of count, however, in Poland, prior to the [[partitions of Poland|partitions]], the title was not officially recognized by the parliament. In 1765 he became a Knight of the [[Order of Saint Stanislaus]].

He became a member of the Polish parliament in 1762. In 1764, Branicki was one of the Electors of [[Stanisław August Poniatowski]] (reigned as Stanisław II August), representing the Halicz county and his father's noble and aristocratic titles. He later became a member of the Military Commission of the Crown. In 1766, as a result of a duel with the famous [[Giacomo Casanova]] who was at that time in Poland, Branicki was seriously wounded in the stomach. In 1766, he gave a speech in the parliament, represented the Halicz county once more.

Branicki was a strong supporter and a member of the [[Radom Confederation]] and mostly focused on how to weaken the influence of [[Karol Stanisław "Panie Kochanku" Radziwiłł]] and possibly on how to deprive Radziwiłł of his fortune. In 1767, as a member of the Repnin [[Sejm]] of [[Sochaczew]], he became a member of the pro-Russian delegation, which was created under the Russian envoy [[Nikolai Repnin]] in order to review the quality of the government of the [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth]].

As a commander, Branicki decided to aid the king and faithfully led the [[Military of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth|Royal Polish Army]] in the years 1768–1772 and helped to suppress the supporters and members of the [[Bar Confederation]]. On June 19, 1768, together with Russian troops he captured the city of [[Bar, Ukraine|Bar]] in [[Ruthenia]], which served as the enemy's headquarters.

In 1770, during the relation crisis with Russia, king Stanisław II Augustus, appointed him as his deputy in the [[Russian Empire]], without consulting it with the [[Czartoryski family]], which was usually responsible for nominating deputies, [[Sejm Marshal]]s and [[Hetman]]s. On January 18, 1771 Branicki arrived in St. [[Saint Petersburg|Petersburg]]. From there he warned king Stanisław that if the Russian delegation in [[Warsaw]] with general Kasper von Saldern would not agree with the Polish Sejm and the parliament, the Russian Empress would partition the country, and so it happened. In 1772 he went on a diplomatic mission to Paris. For these merits Stanisław Augustus gave him the county of [[Biała Cerkiew]] and appointed him the Crown Hetman. Between 1773 and 1775 he was a member of a newly established secret party, responsible for confiscating the assets belonging to the [[Jesuits|Jesuit society]] in the entire country. In 1776 Branicki became a member of [[Andrzej Mokronowski]]'s controversial political party.

At the [[Sejm|Parliament sitting]] of 1778 years Franciszek Ksawery Branicki was appointed the adviser of Permanent Council's Chief Marshal.

Later he was a member of the [[Great Sejm]] and a chairman of the Military Commission of the Commonwealth. He was a strong opponent of reforms applied by the [[Constitution of May 3]], and together with Russian attaches, he co-founded the traitorous [[Confederation of Targowica]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bryk.pl/s%C5%82owniki/s%C5%82ownik_historyczny/87875-branicki_franciszek_ksawery_1730_1819_herbu_korczak.html&lt;/ref&gt; Branicki was included in Yakov Bulhakov's list, which included a summary of people, mostly senators and deputies, that relied on the Russians and were keen to overthrow the Constitution and possibly even the monarch. Throughout his career, Branicki was one of the leaders of the pro-Russian political party.

A conservative, standing behind Bishop [[Kajetan Sołtyk]], Branicki tried everything to keep his former privileges of the Hetman. A determined counterrevolutionary, he refused to sign any treaty that included the partitioning of his homeland. However, because of his sympathy towards the Russians, over the nineteenth century Branicki was considered a traitor, just like other leaders and members of the Targowica Confederation.

Branicki held several great posts in the Commonwealth, most notably being Great Hetman and Crown Hetman. Additionally, he was the general commander of the Lithuanian artillery. On August 13, 1793, he resigned from the position in order to become a general in the Russian army. The owner of many counties, towns and villages in [[Ruthenia]] (Polish Ukraine) made him one of the most powerful and wealthiest [[Polish magnates]], but he was in constant rivalry with Karol Stanisław Radziwiłł, a zealous patriot and one of the richest men in Europe. Branicki resided in [[Biała Cerkiew]] near [[Kiev]], where he spent the last years of his life, having abandoned politics and military service.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bryk.pl/s%C5%82owniki/s%C5%82ownik_historyczny/87875-branicki_franciszek_ksawery_1730_1819_herbu_korczak.html&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Kościuszko Insurrection]], the Supreme Court of Free Poland sentenced him to death by hanging, eternal infamy, confiscation of property and loss of all titles. Because of the absence of the accused, the sentence was carried out ''in absentia'' on September 29, 1794. His portrait, which was hung on the gallows was painted by an anonymous artist. The portraits of [[Stanisław Szczęsny Potocki]] and Hetman [[Seweryn Rzewuski]], which were not captured and convicted of treason, were also hung the same day.

==Character and personality==
The character and personality of Branicki was immortalized as a symbol of national treason by Poland's leading writers and publishers, most notably one being [[Stanisław Wyspiański]]. Branicki was a brawler, but a good and close friend of King Stanisław II Augustus. He liked to give the impression of a man who knows the military – but according to historians he hardly equaled in ability with the Russian cavalry colonels, despite the fact that supposedly he fought bravely during the [[Seven Years' War]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.historycy.org/index.php?showtopic=56486&lt;/ref&gt; After the conflict he was praised by some and hated by others, especially the Polish royal court, which considered Branicki as their new enemy that had to be quickly "eliminated". He was a stubborn and obstinate man, always claiming that he knows best. He was also disliked by the [[Szlachta|Polish nobility]]. Branicki was described as selfish and proud of himself, and in constant rivalry with other powerful magnates like [[Karol Stanisław "Panie Kochanku" Radziwiłł]].

==Remembrance==
He is one of the figures immortalized in [[Jan Matejko]]'s 1891 painting, ''[[Constitution of May 3, 1791 (painting)|Constitution of May 3, 1791]].''&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wilanow-palac.pl/franciszek_ksawery_branicki_ok_1730_1819_awanturnik_i_zdrajca.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Branicki's greediness, treason and baronial-aristocratic pride appear in the drama written by [[Stanisław Wyspiański]] entitled ''[[The Wedding (1901 play)|The Wedding (Wesele)]]''.

'''Frederick Augustus II''' (full name: ''Frederick Augustus Albert Maria Clemens Joseph Vincenz Aloys Nepomuk Johann Baptista Nikolaus Raphael Peter Xavier Franz de Paula Venantius Felix'') ({{Lang-de|Friedrich August II;}} 18 May 1797 in [[Dresden]] &amp;ndash; 9 August 1854 in [[Brennbüchel]], [[Karrösten]], [[Tyrol (state)|Tyrol]]) was [[monarch|King]] of [[Kingdom of Saxony|Saxony]] and a member of the [[House of Wettin]].

He was the eldest son of [[Maximilian, Prince of Saxony]] &amp;mdash; younger son of the Elector Frederick Christian of Saxony &amp;mdash; by his first wife, [[Princess Caroline of Parma|Caroline of Bourbon, Princess of Parma]].

==Life==

===Early years===
From his birth, it was clear that one day Frederick Augustus would become the ruler of Saxony. His father was the only son of the Elector Frederick Christian of Saxony who left surviving male issue. When the King Frederick Augustus I died (1827) and Anton succeeded him as King, Frederick Augustus became second in line to the throne, preceded only by his father Maximilian.

He was an officer in the [[War of the Sixth Coalition]]. However, he had little interest in military affairs.

===Co-Regent to the Kingdom===
The [[July Revolution]] of 1830 in [[France]] marked the beginning of disturbances in Saxony that autumn. The people claimed a change in the constitution and demanded a young regent of the kingdom to share the government with the King Anton. On 1 September the Prince Maximilian renounced his rights of succession in favor of his son Frederick Augustus, who was proclaimed Prince Co-Regent (de: ''Prinz-Mitregenten'') of Saxony. On 2 February 1832 Frederick Augustus brought Free Autonomy to the cities. Also, by an edict of 17 March of that year, the farmers were freed from the corvée and hereditary submission.

===King of Saxony===
On 6 June 1836, King Anton died and Frederick Augustus succeeded him. As an intelligent man, he was quickly popular with the people as he had been since the time of his regency. The new king solved political questions only from a pure sense of duty. Mostly he preferred to leave these things on the hands of his ministers.

A standardized jurisdiction for Saxony created the [[Criminal Code]] of 1836. During the [[German revolutions of 1848–49|Revolutionary disturbances of 1848]] (March Revolution), he appointed liberal ministers in the government, lifted censorship, and remitted a liberal electoral law. Later his attitude changed. On 28 April Frederick August II dissolved the Parliament.  In 1849, Frederick Augustus was forced to flee to the [[Königstein Fortress]]. The [[May Uprising in Dresden|May Uprising]] was crushed by Saxon and [[Prussian Army|Prussian troops]] and Frederick was able to return after only a few days.

===Journey through England and Scotland===
In 1844 Frederick Augustus, accompanied by his personal physician [[Carl Gustav Carus]], made an informal (''incognito'') visit to England and Scotland. Among places they visited were [[Lyme Regis]] where he purchased from the local fossil collector and dealer, [[Mary Anning]], an ichthyosaur skeleton for his own extensive natural history collection. It was not a state visit, but the King was the guest of [[Victoria of the United Kingdom|Queen Victoria]] and [[Albert, Prince Consort|Prince Albert]] at [[Windsor Castle]], visited many of the sights in [[London]] and in the university cities of [[Oxford University|Oxford]] and [[Cambridge University|Cambridge]], and toured widely in England, Wales and Scotland.&lt;ref&gt;C.G.Carus, ''The King of Saxony's Journey through England and Scotland, 1844'', english edition, London, Chapman and Hall, 1846 [https://archive.org/stream/kingofsaxonysjou00caru/kingofsaxonysjou00caru_djvu.txt]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Accidental Death==
During a journey in [[Tyrol (state)|Tyrol]], he had an accident in Brennbüchel in which he fell in front of a horse that stepped on his head. On 8 August 1854, he died in the Gasthof Neuner. He was buried on 16 August in the [[Katholische Hofkirche]] of [[Dresden]]. In his memory, the Dowager Queen Maria arranged to establish the Königskapelle (King's Chapel) at the accident place, which was consecrated one year later, some of the last members of the Saxon royal family, including [[Maria Emanuel, Margrave of Meissen]], are buried beside the chapel

==Marriages==
In [[Vienna]] on 26 September 1819 (by proxy) and again in [[Dresden]] on 7 October 1819 (in person), Frederick Augustus married firstly with the [[Marie Caroline, Crown Princess of Saxony|Archduchess Maria Caroline of Austria]] (Maria Karoline Ferdinande Theresia Josephine Demetria), daughter of Emperor [[Francis II, Holy Roman Emperor|Francis I]] of [[Austrian Empire|Austria]]. They had no children.

In [[Dresden]] on 24 April 1833 Frederick Augustus married secondly with the [[Maria Anna of Bavaria (1805-1877)|Princess Maria Anna of Bavaria]] (Maria Anna Leopoldine Elisabeth Wilhelmine), daughter of the King [[Maximilian I Joseph of Bavaria]]. Like his first marriage, this was childless.

The musician [[Theodor Uhlig]] (1822–1853) was an illegitimate son of Frederick Augustus.&lt;ref&gt;John Warrack, ''Uhlig, Theodor'', [[Oxford Music Online]],consulted 23.6.2010&lt;/ref&gt;

Without legitimate issue, after his death Frederick Augustus was succeeded by his younger brother, [[John of Saxony|Johann]].

[[File:Antônio Parreiras - Estudo para Frei Caneca.jpg|thumb|'Study of Frei Caneca' by [[Museu Antônio Parreiras]]]]

'''Joaquim da Silva Rabelo''', later '''Frei Joaquim do Amor Divino Rabelo''' (August 20, 1779 – January 13, 1825)&lt;ref name="uol"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://educacao.uol.com.br/biografias/frei-caneca.jhtm|title=Frei Caneca - Biografia - UOL Educação|publisher=|accessdate=25 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;, commonly known as '''Frei Caneca''' ([[English language|English]]: Friar Mug), was a brazilian religious leader, politician, and journalist. He was involved in multiple revolts in [[Northeastern Brazil]] during the early 19th century&lt;ref name=barros&gt;Homero do Rêgo Barros, ''Frei Caneca: herói e mártir republicano'' (1983), 8 pages&lt;/ref&gt;. He acted as the main leader on the [[Pernambucan Revolt]]. As a journalist, he founded and edited ''Typhis Pernambucano'', a weekly journal used on the [[Confederation of the Equator]].

[[Evaldo Cabral de Mello]] described him as: "The man in the [[history of Brazil]] that embodied the quintessential nativist sentiment was curiously a Lusitanian 'jus sanguinis'."

==Early life==
Frei Caneca was the oldest son of [[Portuguese Brazilians|portuguese]] parents. His father, Domingos da Silva Rabelo, was a [[cooper (profession)|cooper]] from whom he got his nickname. His mother, Francisca Maria Alexandrina de Siqueira, was the cousin of a [[Carmelite]] nun. The family resided in [[Recife]], more precisely in Fora-de-Portas, today known as Comunidade do Pilar, built during the [[Dutch Brazil]] era.

He became a novice at the Carmo and took the [[Religious habit]] in 1796 and professed the next year (1797).

== Career ==

[[File:Frei Caneca.jpg|thumb|Frei Caneca.]]

He was ordained into the Carmelite Order in 1801, with the necessary apostolic dispensation of age 22, and created the Seminário de Olinda. He was authorized to attend the courses that the Order had not offered. He attended the seminary and oratorians libraries in Recife. In 1803 he was designated to teach [[rhetoric]] and [[geometry]] at his convent. Later he taught rational and moral [[philosophy]].

At some point, "his interest goes beyond the walls of the cloister, as indicated by its provision in public chair geometry of [[Alagoas]] region."It remained there a short time, given the prospect of appointment to the same chair in Recife, which failed to materialize by the [[Pernambucan Revolt]] of 1817.

Frei Caneca shared [[Liberalism|liberalist]] ideas, [[republic]]an thoughts, and attended the ''Academia do Paraíso'', one of the meeting places of those who, influenced by the [[French Revolution]] and [[US independence]], conspired against Portuguese rule.

==Participation in revolts==
[[File:Campo das Princezas, (Largo do Palacio).jpg|thumb|left|[[Recife]] being captured by Pernambucan rebels|349x349px]]

=== Movement in Pernambuco and prison in Bahia ===
Caneca's first foray into political life was during the [[Pernambucan Revolt]] when [[Pernambuco]] and other nearby states rebelled against the Portuguese royal court, which had [[Transfer of the Portuguese Court to Brazil|relocated to Brazil]] during the [[Peninsular War]]. They felt that the government was ignoring the sugar-producing north in favor of the coffee-producing south, which was closer to [[Rio de Janeiro]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brasilescola.com/historiab/revolucao-pernambucana.htm|title=Revolução Pernambucana de 1817 - Brasil Escola|publisher=|accessdate=25 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The revolt proclaimed a Republic and organized the first independent government in the region. No reference to his participation survived: "In the opening events of sedition on March 6, as the formation of the provisional government. Thus it is that the list of voters who chose him, not in his name. His presence only detects the last weeks of existence of the regime, to monitor the republican army, which marched to the south of the province, in order to face the troops of the Count of Arcos, at which, according to the indictment, would have exercised captain of guerrillas." He was the adviser to Republican South Army, which was commanded by Colonel Suassuna.

After the rebellion was put down, he was imprisoned in [[Salvador (Bahia)|Salvador]] for four years. During that time, he dedicated himself to the drafting of the Portuguese Grammar.

=== Return to Pernambuco ===
Pardoned&lt;ref&gt;Nossa História. Year 3 issue 35. São Paulo: Vera Cruz, 2006, p.44&lt;/ref&gt; in 1821, in the context of the constitutionalist movement in Portugal, Frei Caneca returned to Pernambuco and resumed political activities. During his trip, he came to be held in a [[Prison|gaol]] of [[Campina Grande]]. In 1821 he was involved in the so-called movement of Goiana, a second sedition emancipationist movement that proclaimed adherence to the Lisbon Cortes with the support of the principal owners of the north woods and cotton provincial support. An army of rural militias and frontline troops marched against Recife, without occupying the city. The goianistas failed to find substantial support in the southern forest. The "Beberibe Convention" consecrated in September the "status quo", predicting that Recife and Goiana would continue to operate in the areas under their control, pending the decision of the Courts. These determined the election of a provisional board that became the first self-government of the province in October 1821.

=== The Governing Board of Gervasio ===
Frei Caneca supported the formation of the first Board of Governors of Pernambuco, chaired by a trader, Gervasio Pires Ferreira, who appointed him to the public chair of geometry in Recife. It was a very Recifean Board, where the power came from the clergy, the urban strata, trade, the armed forces and the liberal professions - the defeated forces in 1817. Gervasio was the dominant figure of a government that wanted consensus. He was the leader of a Portuguese trade sector that was already nationalized by residence, by birth, and by family ties to the land.

In 1822 Frei Caneca, who enthusiastically supported the Board, wrote the "Dissertation on what is meant by country citizen and duties to this with the same country." He wanted to give theoretical formulation to one of the main objectives of Gervasio, which was to reconcile the Portuguese trade in the province with the new order. His main thesis was that the Portuguese domiciled in the ground and connected to it by family ties and interests should be considered as Pernambuco's main interest.

Evaldo Cabral de Mello stated, "The Cortes of Lisbon, on one hand, and the regency of [[Pedro I of Brazil|Dom Pedro]], on the other, embodied in terms of 1817 aspirations, equally legitimate options, although incomplete and contradictory. On one hand, the Sovereign Congress offered a liberal regime, under a constitutional monarchy, though, from February 1822, was clear in Brazil that they would charge the price of not pure and simple restoration of the commercial monopoly, it was impossible to resurrect but a preferential system for trade and Portuguese navigation. In turn, the regency of Rio promised freedom of trade and independence but with the expected bill of building an authoritarian regime based in south-central (region of Brazil)."
[[File:Pernambucan Revolt.jpg|thumb|280x280px|A battle during the Pernambucan Revolt.]]
The government of Gervasio tried to gain time, waiting for a situation that would protect both options without entirely ruling out the separation from both Lisbon and Rio. The Board will be anathematized [[Varnhagen]] Jose Honorio Rodrigues, accused of lack of national feeling, their defense was made by [[Barbosa Lima Sobrinho]]).

Under the pressure of a military riot, the joint Gervasio Pires Ferreira was coerced to join the cause of Rio de Janeiro and ended up deposed by a military uprising, forming a so-called "Yokels Government" in October 1822.

=== The Board of Yokels ===
On September 23, 1822, the so-called "Board of Yokels" was elected, which replaced the Gervasiana Board. This government lasted until December 1823. It was dominated by representatives of large landed property. elected members of the Board were President Afonso de Albuquerque Maranhao, Secretary Jose Mariano de Albuquerque and members Francisco Pais Barreto, squire Cape; Francisco de Paula Gomes dos Santos, Manuel Inacio Bezerra de Melo, Francisco de Paula Cavalcanti de Albuquerque and João Nepomuceno Carneiro da Cunha.

This led Frei Caneca to join the fray. His polemic with José Fernandes Gama and his nephew, Judge Bernardo José da Gama, conspiracy leaders criticized Gervasio, writing "Pythia Letters to Daman". 'Pedrosada' was a failed attempt to overthrow the Board of Yokels. Afterwards, the Gamas tried to recover in court and denounced what they called the Republican faction of the province, drawing up a list of suspects that included Frei Caneca.

"Brother Mug sided with the opposition without fighting it, but he preferred to engage against the group in [[Rio de Janeiro]], which intended to dictate the fate of the province. Frei Caneca even pronounced a gratitude prayer on the occasion of the thanksgiving ceremony in the Church of the Holy Body, by [[Pedro I of Brazil|Pedro I]] acclamation as emperor. Only from the constitution of [[Manuel de Carvalho Pais de Andrade]] government that seven months after the inauguration proclaim the Confederation of Ecuador, there were signs of close collaboration of Frei Caneca with power, but also in the form of journalistic activity and, sporadically, giving his opinion on some of the big decisions that the government should take."

The first of his letters went out March 17, 1823, shortly after the 'Pedrosada'. It was published in the ''Mail of Rio de Janeiro'', a periodical property of João Soares Lisboa, who participated in the Confederation of the Equator, and died on September 30, 1824, wounded in combat during his escape through the interior of Pernambuco next to Brother Mug and other companions. Pedro da Silva Pedroso, or Pedrosa, was the governor of arms of the province that retraced the Pais Barreto alliance that toppled Gervasio, without which could depose him, for his support of Gama, in court.

Frei Caneca never fought the Board of Yokels. He preferred to focus on the Pernambuco faction of the Court, endorsing the personnel policy of the emperor, be it under [[José Bonifácio de Andrada|Jose Bonifácio]], or under his successors.

As for the Pedrosada, the established wanton that pronounced Pedrosa and Paula Gomes and José Fernandes Gama members of the government, and due to the imperial protection none of them were to be punished. Divided and demoralized, the Board of Yokels dragged a sad resistance until December 1823 when he resigned. Faced by the opposition of the old gervasistas around the mayor of Manuel de Carvalho Andrade, Navy Parent, and [[Cipriano Barata]], who had returned from Lisbon Cortes; and the pressures of Rio de Janeiro, which required Pernambuco monthly amounts of the king's time and further two million, equivalent to shipments to Portugal after the departure of the king.

=== The Confederation of Ecuador ===
He and others soon grew frustrated with the constitution of the newly formed [[Empire of Brazil]]&lt;ref name="Enciclopédia Barsa 1987, p.464"&gt;Enciclopédia Barsa. Volume 5: Camarão, Rep.

In addition, he published ''[[Typhis Pernambucano]]'', a pro-Confederation newspaper critical of [[Pedro I of Brazil|Pedro I]] and the imperial government from 1823 to 1824.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.historytoday.com/gabriel-paquette/empire-exceptions-making-modern-brazil|title=Empire of Exceptions: The Making of Modern Brazil - History Today|publisher=|accessdate=25 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is essential to know the political and provincial context of Brother Mug political works, the situation in which they lived Pernambuco and the other provinces to understand the movement that represented the Confederation of Ecuador - muffled under "the weight of [[Saquarema]]'s tradition in Brazilian historiography Independence", that is, which Evaldo Cabral de Mello called "the historiography of Rio de Janeiro state court and its epigones in the Republic" claiming for the three great provinces of the Southeast the role of builders of nationality. The revolutionary Pernambuco cycle cannot, of course, be considered separatists - but the presumption of separatism was the result of the gap occurred between the emancipation process in the Southeast and Northeast. In Rio, says Cabral de Mello, `The Independence began as a dispute between absolutists and liberals around the [[United Kingdom of Portugal, Brazil and the Algarves|United Kingdom of Portugal]] organization and even then not cogitated separation Portugal, only to preserve the status acquired by Brazil within the Lusitanian empire. The situation was very different in the Northeast, where independence has started with a dispute between colony and metropolis, with the difference that the latter was no longer in [[Lisbon]] but in Rio de Janeiro...
[[File:Or1731 f31.jpg|thumb|391x391px|The bay of Recife, and the reefs that gave the city its name.]]
In 1823 during the movement known as 'Pedrosada', Brother Mug I wrote "The Hunter" and "Pythia Letters to Daman". Says Cabral de Mello, page 29 of the cited work: "In the euphoria that followed the liberal revolution of the Kingdom, the expectations of reducing the burden of taxes in trade and agriculture were not lower than the rest of Brazil. They were perhaps larger, since the installation of the court in 1808, Pernambuco was burdened with new taxes for including the public lighting of Rio, promptly revoked by Gervasio's Board. (...) The state of bankruptcy that had reduced [[Banco do Brasil]] with the return of [[John VI of Portugal|King John VI]] and the establishment of provincial boards had severely limited the action of the Court, which had only the customs resources and province of Rio de Janeiro time the other provinces also denied resources. Thus, the north accession to the emperor was above all a matter of urgent financial, coffee not as profitable at the mid-30s, so the main line of the tax revenue which had to come from [[sugar]] and [[cotton]], products predominantly northerners."

He took part with Cipriano Barata, as one of the leaders in the Ecuadorian Confederation, republican and separatist movement. His arguments are not directed against the emperor but against what he considered the authoritarian drift of Jose Bonifacio. After September 7, "the intensification of the fight between Jose Bonifacio and the liberals of the Court had led to censorship of the press, with the closure of newspapers and the attack on the director of the [[Malagueta]], and the arrest of more than 300 individuals, the same who had beaten for independence since the departure of John VI". There were other dissatisfaction reasons: requirements of Rio de Janeiro state treasury, the draft constitution published by the Correio Brasiliense in September 1822, the creation of the Swiss battalion, the foundation of the Apostolate, the institution of Imperial Cruise Order, seen as "the club of servile aristocrats."

Evaldo Cabral de Mello believes it would be more appropriate instead of Pernambuco republicanism, consider itself autonomous."The Revolution project was ancient in Pernambuco" later comment on the judge of Appeals that dismissed the motion. There was "a reinterpretation of provincial history in the light of revolutionary modernity represented by the political philosophy of the Enlightenment and the French Revolution." For Brother Mug and the Autonomous Party, punished by Republican failure in 1817, "the provincial autonomy had priority over the form of government." They would be ready to enter into a commitment to the Rio, which in exchange for acceptance of the monarchical regime, would give ample relief to provinces. There would be no reason to reject the monarchy, since authentically constitutional and since preserved the franchises. Reading the newspaper, Cipriano Barata, "The Sentinel of Liberty", denied the charges of republicanism.

In 1824 Frei Caneca became one of the advisers of Manuel de Carvalho Pais de Andrade, opining against recognizing Francisco Pais Barreto, the squire of the Cabo, as president of Pernambuco. He opined the Alagoas invasion, in order to eradicate the counter-revolutionary forces squire of Cabo; and against the oath of the Constitution bestowed by D. Pedro I. Says Evaldo Cabral de Mello that "Brother Mug underestimated the means at the disposal of Rio Court, overestimating the other hand, the local will of resistance to Rio's despotism."

D. Pedro I suspended constitutional guarantees in the province, punishing it territorially, amputating the district of San Francisco, on which was the left bank of the river San Francisco, now incorporated into the territory of Bahia. Recife underwent naval blockade, this time by Admiral [[Thomas Cochrane, 10th Earl of Dundonald|Cochrane]], who bombarded the city. Pernambuco was invaded from the south by the troops of [[Brigadier Lima e Silva]]. Since the sugarcane owners in the south woods remained neutral, his troops easily occupied Recife in September 12, 1824.

Again defeated, he took refuge with a part of his troops in the countryside and fled north towards Ceará. During this flight, he started writing the "Route".

== The Typhis Pernambucano ==
On December 25, 1823 circulated the first issue of "[[Typhis Pernambucano]]" newspaper that would be the trench of Brother Mug until the settlement of the Confederacy. It states that is considered guilty of the situation of the Portuguese party in Rio and the ministry had happened to [[José Bonifácio de Andrada|José Bonifácio]]. The dissolution of the Assembly took Pernambuco by surprise but "from July 2 on wards the history of Confederation became the narrative of defeat."

== Prison and death ==
[[File:Freicaneca.jpg|thumb|257x257px|Frei Caneca before execution, by [[Murillo La Greca]]]].
After the defeat of the Confederation, he was arrested by imperial troops on 29 November&lt;ref&gt;Lustosa, Isabel. D. Pedro I. São Paulo: Companhia das Letras, 2007, p.176&lt;/ref&gt; for his participation as Secretary of the armed rebellion and also as its spiritual director. He was incarcerated in Recife. On December 18, 1824 there was established a military commission under the chairmanship of Colonel [[Francisco de Lima e Silva]] (father of the future [[Luís Alves de Lima e Silva, Duke of Caxias|Duke of Caxias]]) to conduct the trial on the charges of sedition and rebellion against the imperial orders of his Imperial majesty. With full power to judge and condemn summarily, the accused was sentenced to death by [[hanging]]. The convict himself described his trial:&lt;blockquote&gt;"On the 20th, I was brought before the assassin court of commission, whose members were General Francisco de Lima e Silva, president, judge-rapporteur, Thomas Xavier Garcia de Almeida, and other members, Colonel engineering Salvador Jose Maciel, the Lieutenant Colonel hunters Francisco Vicente Souto, Colonel hunters Manuel Antonio Leitao Flag, the Earl of Escragnolle, that was my questioner."&lt;ref&gt;"Itinerário", in: ''Frei Joaquim do Amor Divino Caneca''. Coleção Formadores do Brasil, 1994. p. 604. A mesma obra reproduz os autos do processo (p. 607 e seguintes).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;On December 18 he was tried by a military commission, found guilty, and sentenced to death by hanging. In court documents, Frei Caneca was indicted as one of the rebellion's leaders and for writing incendiary papers. The two other leaders were Stinho Bezerra Cavalcanti, captain of grenadiers and commander of the 4th Battalion Gunners Henriques, and Francisco de Souza Rangel.

Altogether the execution involved eleven confederates, including three in Rio de Janeiro. The first was Brother Mug, who charged with [[sedition]] and [[rebellion]].

In January 13, 1825, was set up the hanging of the show before the walls of the [[Fort of Five Points]]. Stripped of religious habit, i.e. "without the orders in the Rosary church, the sacred canons form" still having three executioners who refused to hang him. The Military Commission ordered his death by [[firing squad]], ("since it can not be hanged for disobedience of the executioners")&lt;ref name="uol" /&gt;&lt;ref name="barros" /&gt;. Attached to one of the gallows rods, by a platoon under the command of the same official. His body was placed near one of the gates of the Carmelite church in the center of Recife, being collected by religious and buried in place until now unidentified.

The wall against which the cleric was shot, next to the Five Points Fort, still stands. The site is marked by a bust and an allusive plaque placed by the [[Archaeological Institute, History and Geography Pernambucano]] in 1917. The iconography of Brother Mug, the best-known work is the public "Execution Frei Caneca", by Murillo La Greca.

==In culture==
The poet and writer [[João Cabral de Melo Neto]] described in verses, in 1984, the last day of Frei Caneca, in his work The Friar's Way (Auto do Frade)&lt;ref&gt;Süssekind, Flora. ''Stepping Into Prose'', [[World Literature Today]], vol.33 no.4 (autumn 1992.) JSTOR.&lt;/ref&gt;. His brother, the historian [[Evaldo Cabral de Mello]], was the organizer and wrote the introduction to the book "Frei Joaquim do Amor Divino Caneca Coleção Formadores do Brasil", Editora 34, Ltda, 2001 entitled "Brother Mug or Another Independence" (Frei Caneca ou an Outra Independência). As for the other players, says Evaldo Cabral de Mello, [[Manuel de Carvalho]] took refuge on board an [[English frigate]], going to live in [[London]], where only return after the abdication to restart a political career that would take him to the presidency of Pernambuco and Senate Empire. The poet Natividade Saldanha, secretary of the Board, is sought asylum in Venezuela and then in Bogota, where he practiced [[law]] and died in 1830.

===Dallas Cowboys===
Escobar was selected by the [[Dallas Cowboys]] in the second round (47th overall) of the [[2013 NFL Draft]]. After having mixed results from using previous second round draft choices in [[tight end]]s [[Anthony Fasano]] and [[Martellus Bennett]], the Cowboys surprised observers by selecting another [[tight end]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.espn.com/blog/dallas/cowboys/post/_/id/4735671/heavily-criticized-2013-draft-class-coming-up-big-for-cowboys | title=Heavily criticized 2013 draft class coming up big for Cowboys | publisher=ESPN.com | date=2014-10-19 | accessdate=2014-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.dallascowboys.com/news/2013/05/12/spagnola-quest-second-te-becoming-never-ending-quest | title=Quest For Second TE Becoming Never-Ending Quest | accessdate=January 3, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://collegefootball.ap.org/wgem/article/cowboys-will-be-judged-lineman-after-draft-move | title=Cowboys will be judged by lineman after draft move | accessdate=January 3, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====2013====
In his rookie season, he was expected to be a pass catching option in the two [[tight end]] packages, but he was used sparingly, registering 9 receptions for 134 yards and 2 [[touchdown]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.nfl.com/player/gavinescobar/2540211/profile|title = NFL Player Profile|date = |accessdate = 27 June 2014| publisher = NFL.com |last = | first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

====2014====
Escobar remained in a backup role in his second season in the league, but was passed on the depth chart by [[James Hanna]], who was used to block at the point of attack in the running game. He was mostly used on [[special teams]] and as a [[Red zone (gridiron football)|red zone]] target, finishing with 105 receiving yards and 4 [[touchdown]]s on 9 receptions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.espn.com/blog/dallas/cowboys/post/_/id/4740177/cowboys-position-review-tight-ends | title=Cowboys position review: Tight ends | publisher=ESPN.com | date=2015-01-30 | accessdate=2017-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====2015====
Even though [[wide receiver]] [[Dez Bryant]] missed 7 games, Escobar still wasn't able to increase his role in the team's offense and remained as the third-string [[tight end]]. The 12 games that [[quarterback]] [[Tony Romo]] missed, also impacted his production, finishing with 8 receptions for 64 yards and one touchdown. 

He suffered a season-ending injury when he tore his right [[Achilles tendon]] in the last drive of the fourteenth game of the season against the [[New York Jets]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.espn.com/blog/nfceast/post/_/id/71457/three-years-in-cowboys-still-havent-found-a-fit-for-gavin-escobar | title=Three years in, Cowboys still haven't found a fit for Gavin Escobar | publisher=ESPN.com | date=2016-12-23 | accessdate=2016-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; On December 25, he was placed on the [[injured reserve list]], in order to promote [[defensive tackle]] [[Casey Walker]] to the 53-man roster.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Cowboys Give Christmas Present To Jameill Showers And Casey Walker|url = http://www.bloggingtheboys.com/2015/12/25/10666070/dallas-cowboys-give-christmas-present-jameill-showers-casey-walker-tony-romo-gavin-escobar|website = Blogging The Boys|accessdate = 2015-12-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====2016====
Escobar made a surprising quick recovery from his Achilles injury, allowing him to have a full participation in [[Training camp (National Football League)|training camp]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.espn.com/blog/dallas-cowboys/post/_/id/4752580/in-return-from-achilles-tear-gavin-escobar-letting-go | title=Cowboys' Gavin Escobar lets loose in return from torn Achilles | publisher=ESPN.com | date=2016-08-07 | accessdate=2017-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; though he was passed on the depth chart by [[Geoff Swaim]], who displayed better blocking ability. After being used primarily as a core [[special teams]] player and only participating in 29 offensive plays, Escobar became the backup tight end after  Swaim suffered a season-ending injury in the week 10 win against the [[Pittsburgh Steelers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.espn.com/blog/nflnation/post/_/id/221675/gavin-escobar-gets-final-chance-to-show-cowboys-what-he-can-do | title=Gavin Escobar gets final chance to show Cowboys what he can do | publisher=ESPN.com | date=2017-11-18 | accessdate=2016-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because he struggled with his blocking, the Cowboys were forced to use [[offensive line]]man [[Joe Looney (offensive lineman)|Joe Looney]] as the blocking tight end in short yardage situations. He finished with 4 receptions and one touchdown.

Although he had the size and continued improving his technique, he could never develop into a dependable in-line blocker. As with other Cowboys tight ends during the [[Jason Witten]] era, the team's coaches could never find a complementary role for him in the passing game, which limited Escobar to never starting more than 4 games and recording more than 9 receptions in a season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.espn.com/blog/nflnation/post/_/id/174889/cowboys-have-a-stake-in-growing-gavin-escobars-role | title=Cowboys have a stake in growing Gavin Escobar's role | publisher=ESPN.com | date=2016-08-18 | accessdate=2017-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; He played in 62 games (7 starts), making 30 receptions for 333 yards and 8 touchdowns.

On March 31, Escobar signed a one-year contract as a [[free agent]] with the [[Kansas City Chiefs]], to provide depth in a position that had some uncertainty, with starter [[Travis Kelce]] rehabbing from offseason shoulder surgery and backup [[Demetrius Harris]] having been arrested in March for felony possession of marijuana and possession of paraphernalia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Chiefs set to sign TE Gavin Escobar|url=http://profootballtalk.nbcsports.com/2017/03/31/chiefs-set-to-sign-te-gavin-escobar/|author=Gehlken, Michael|website=ProFootballTalk.NBCSports.com|date=March 31, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; On September 2, he was released after not being able to pass [[Ross Travis]] on the depth chart.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Chiefs Roster Down to NFL Mandated 53|url=http://www.chiefs.com/news/article-2/Chiefs-Roster-Down-to-NFL-Mandated-53/29056cc8-800b-4a3f-be18-d873f2470e6b|website=Chiefs.com|date=September 2, 2017|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180603165651/http://www.chiefs.com/news/article-2/Chiefs-Roster-Down-to-NFL-Mandated-53/29056cc8-800b-4a3f-be18-d873f2470e6b|archivedate=June 3, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Baltimore Ravens===
On October 23, 2017, Escobar signed with the [[Baltimore Ravens]], who were looking to improve their depth after [[tight end]] [[Maxx Williams]] re-injured his ankle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ravens Sign Former Second-Round Tight End|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180223215455/http://www.baltimoreravens.com/news/article-1/Ravens-Sign-Former-Second-Round-Tight-End/9b82b28b-7874-4621-b047-f8457f14e05b|author=Mink, Ryan|website=BaltimoreRavens.com|date=October 23, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; On November 18, he was released to make room for [[Danny Woodhead]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ravens Activate Danny Woodhead to 53-Man Roster|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180427045308/http://www.baltimoreravens.com/news/article-1/Ravens-Activate-Danny-Woodhead-to-53-Man-Roster/0d91b74c-8c4a-49ef-98d5-324c507091ce|author=Mink, Ryan|website=BaltimoreRavens.com|date=November 18, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Gene Kelly]] (1912–1996) was an American [[dance]]r, [[actor]], [[singing|singer]], [[film director|director]], [[Film producer|producer]] and [[choreographer]] whose work in [[film|motion pictures]] spans from 1942 to 1996. He is probably best known today for his performances in musicals, notably ''[[An American in Paris (film)|An American in Paris]]'' (1951) and ''[[Singin' in the Rain]]'' (1952).

Kelly made his [[Hollywood]] film debut in ''[[For Me and My Gal (film)|For Me and My Gal]]'' (1942), co-starring with [[Judy Garland]].&lt;ref name="PBS-Masters"&gt;{{cite web| url = https://www.pbs.org/wnet/americanmasters/episodes/gene-kelly/anatomy-of-a-dancer/516/| title = Gene Kelly&amp;nbsp;— Anatomy of a Dancer| work = [[American Masters]]| publisher = [[Public Broadcasting Service]]| accessdate = 2009-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Afterward, he went on to work as an actor, dancer and subsequently, choreographer, in a series of musical films. In these films, his choreography included experiments with a combination of dance and animation (''[[Anchors Aweigh (film)|Anchors Aweigh]]'' and ''[[Invitation to the Dance (film)|Invitation to the Dance]]'') and dance scenes involving special effects (including the "Alter Ego" number from ''[[Cover Girl (film)|Cover Girl]]'' and the split-screen dance number from ''[[It's Always Fair Weather]]'').{{sfn|Thomas|1991|p=52}}{{sfn|Thomas|1991|p=162}} In addition to his work as an actor and choreographer, Kelly directed or co-directed several films, some of which did not feature him in an acting role. Kelly appeared in several non-musical [[drama]]tic and [[comedy]] films as well.

Kelly received an [[Academy Award]] nomination for [[Academy Award for Best Actor|Best Actor]] for his performance in ''Anchors Aweigh'' (1945) and won an [[Academy Honorary Award#1950s|Honorary Academy Award]] for his work in ''An American in Paris'' (1951).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://awardsdatabase.oscars.org/ampas_awards/DisplayMain.jsp;jsessionid=67816743B3229B413ADF31E8376268AE.squash?curTime=1237320849022| title = Gene Kelly: Awards| publisher = Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences| accessdate = 2009-03-17| quote = In appreciation of his versatility as an actor, singer, director and dancer, and specifically for his brilliant achievements in the art of choreography on film.}}{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was voted the 15th most popular film actor on the [[American Film Institute]]’s millennium list, while his ''Singin' in the Rain'' was voted the [[AFI's 100 Years of Musicals|most popular movie musical of all time]].&lt;ref name="PBS-Masters" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.afi.com/100years/musicals.aspx| title = AFI's Greatest Movie Musicals| publisher = [[American Film Institute]]| year = 2010| accessdate = 2010-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Hong Qi''', better known as '''Hong Qigong''',&lt;ref group="notes"&gt;The "gong", which means "grandfather" or "grandpa", is actually not part of his name. His apprentices, followers and younger generations call him "Qigong" ("Grandpa Qi") to show their respect for him as an elder and their affection for him as a grandfatherly figure.&lt;/ref&gt; is a fictional character in the [[wuxia]] novel ''[[The Legend of the Condor Heroes]]'' and its sequel, ''[[The Return of the Condor Heroes]]'', by [[Jin Yong]]. Best known for his most powerful martial arts (the 'Eighteen Dragon-Subduing Palms' and the 'Dog Beating Staff Technique'), Hong Qigong is the chief of the [[Beggars' Sect]] and the "Northern Beggar" of the Five Greats. He is nicknamed "Nine Fingered Divine Beggar" after he severs one of his fingers to remind himself to be more time conscious as he has once failed a mission after overindulgence in fine cuisine. He plays a supporting role in the first novel by imparting his skills to [[Guo Jing]] and [[Huang Rong]]. Huang Rong succeeds him as the Beggars' Sect's chief. Although he appears as a happy-go-lucky old beggar who idles his time away, he actually uses his skills to help those in need and perform chivalrous deeds.

==In ''The Legend of the Condor Heroes''==
Little is known of Hong's past, except that he once mentioned that he was a slave of [[Jurchen people|Jurchen]] officials in the [[Jin dynasty (1115–1234)|Jin Empire]] before he joined the [[Beggars' Sect]]. He cut off his right forefinger in remorse after failing a mission, which cost a righteous man's life, because of his overindulgence in fine cuisine.

Hong Qigong makes his first appearance in the novel during [[Guo Jing]] and [[Huang Rong]]'s first adventure. Huang Rong is preparing food and the fragrant scent titillates Hong Qigong's senses. He appears and asks to taste the food. Huang Rong examines his physical appearance closely, sees his Dog Beating Staff and missing finger, and concludes that he is the "Northern Beggar".

Huang Rong asks Hong Qigong to teach Guo Jing martial arts. In return, she prepares fine cuisine every day for him. Hong Qigong succumbs to the temptation of delicious food and stays for almost a month with them. During that period of time, he teaches Guo Jing the 'Eighteen Dragon-Subduing Palms'. He was initially suspicious of Huang Rong when he recognises her as the daughter of his rival, [[Huang Yaoshi]]. He was reluctant to teach her martial arts but eventually imparts the 'Carefree Fist' to her.

Hong Qigong leaves them after that and meets them again during their encounter with Ouyang Ke. The lecherous Ouyang Ke was attempting to kidnap Cheng Yaojia and rape her, but Guo, Huang and members of the [[Beggars' Sect]] save her. Hong Qigong helps them drive away Ouyang Ke. He then formally accepts Guo Jing and Huang Rong as his students and imparts the full set of the 'Eighteen Dragon-Subduing Palms' to Guo Jing. He also teaches Huang Rong the 'Rain of Petals' skill.

Hong Qigong sets foot on [[Peach Blossom Island]] later and intervenes in the contest between Guo Jing and Ouyang Ke. Huang Yaoshi allows Hong Qigong, Guo Jing and [[Zhou Botong]] to leave Peach Blossom Island later on a damaged ship. The ship sinks in the middle of the sea but the trio are rescued by [[Ouyang Feng]], whose ship sailed past the wreck. On board, Ouyang Feng uses all sorts of means to force Hong Qigong and Guo Jing to hand over the ''Nine Yin Manual''. However, they deliberately wrote a corrupted version of the manual (with verses written in reverse manner) for him, in hope that he will be weakened after practising the skills wrongly.

Hong Qigong and Ouyang Feng start fighting and the former was poisoned when the latter used snake venom on him, and the ship sank. Guo Jing and Huang Rong managed to rescue Hong Qigong and they settle on a nearby island. The Ouyangs also set foot on the island and the five of them are stranded there. Hong Qigong uses all his [[Neigong|inner energy]] to heal himself by purging the poison from his body, but loses his powers in the process.

Hong Qigong decides to pass his position as the Beggars' Sect's chief to Huang Rong and teaches her the 'Dog Beating Staff Technique'. When Hong Qigong, Guo Jing and Huang Rong manage to leave the island, Hong follows them on their adventures together with Zhou Botong. They venture into the palace, where Hong Qigong says he wants to taste imperial cuisine again. When he meets his students again, Guo Jing and Huang Rong now have a better understanding of the ''Nine Yin Manual'' and they pass their knowledge to him to help him recover faster. Hong Qigong is briefly mentioned again in the scene on [[Mount Hua]] before the novel ends.

==In ''The Return of the Condor Heroes''==
Hong Qigong makes a brief appearance in the sequel novel. He has regained his powers after losing them earlier in the first novel, and continues to roam the ''[[jianghu]]'' as a carefree old beggar hunting for culinary delights. He meets [[Yang Guo]] on [[Mount Hua]] and is impressed with the young man's chivalric nature. He also encounters his old rival, [[Ouyang Feng]].

Hong Qigong and Ouyang Feng fight with each other again – this time for a period of four days. The fight is interrupted when Yang Guo comes at intervals to serve them meals. The animosity between the two rivals is too strong for them to bear and they continue to pit their [[Neigong|inner energies]] against each other for a full day. Both of them suffer from exhaustion but are unwilling to back down to uphold their ego. They decide to use Yang Guo, who has been an observer for the past few days, as an intermediate. They teach Yang Guo their respective skills and ask him to perform for each other to see.

Hong Qigong teaches Yang Guo the 'Dog Beating Staff Technique'. Ouyang Feng had apparently lost after Yang Guo performed the last stance, 'No Dogs Under Heaven'. Ouyang Feng spends the following night thinking of a counter-move. The next morning, he asks Yang Guo to perform in front of Hong Qigong, who is shocked when he sees that Ouyang Feng has overcome his most powerful move. Hong Qigong finally realises that there will be no eventual victor between him and Ouyang Feng. He laughs hysterically and embraces his rival in defeat. At the same time, Ouyang Feng seems to have recovered from his insanity as he finally recognises Hong Qigong. The two of them die together in the midst of laughter and forgotten past feuds. Yang Guo buries them side by side on Mount Hua.

==Martial arts and skills==
{{see also|Beggars' Sect#Skills and martial arts}}

* 'Eighteen Dragon-Subduing Palms' (降龍十八掌) is the most powerful of all external martial arts mentioned in the novels. The skill is created based on the principles in the ''[[I Ching|Yi Jing]]''.
* 'Dog Beating Staff Technique' (打狗棒法) is a set of 36 styles of staff techniques. The skill is only known to the Beggars' Sect's chief and passed down from each chief to his/her successor.
* 'Carefree Fist' (逍遙遊) is a set of fist techniques created by Hong Qigong in his youth. The skill is smooth and visually appealing but lacks real power.
* 'Rain of Petals' (滿天花雨) is created by Hong Qigong to counter Ouyang Ke's snake formation after he sees Huang Rong's sewing kit. It involves using common sewing needles as dart-like throwing weapons to pin down the snakes.
* Guo Jing and Huang Rong pass their knowledge of the ''Nine Yin Manual'' (九陰真經) to Hong Qigong to help him recover from his battle with Ouyang Feng. Hong Qigong practises the skills in the book and regains his powers in the sequel novel.

'''Irina Petrovna Tokmakova''' (née Manukova, 3 March 1929 — 5 April 2018) was a Soviet and Russian writer of children's books, a poet, playwright, and a translator of classic children's literature into [[Russian language|Russian]]. Her translations of [[Tove Jansson]], [[Astrid Lindgren]] and [[Kenneth Grahame]]'s works were particularly renowned. She was a laureate of the [[State Prize of the Russian Federation]] for children's literature, and the [[Alexander Grin]] literary prize.

==Life==
Irina Manukova was born in Moscow to Perch Manukian (an [[Armenians|Armenian]], whose Russified name was Pyotr Manukov), an electrical engineer, and Lidia Diligenskaya, a paediatrician at a local orphanage.&lt;ref name=solidarnost/&gt;

During the [[Second World War]], she and her sister were sent to [[Penza]] to stay with relatives. For a while, there was no news from her parents, but some time later, her mother's orphanage was evacuated to Penza, and her parents were able to join her. They lived in Penza till 1943, after which they returned to Moscow, where the orphanage was re-established.&lt;ref name=solidarnost/&gt;

Manukova graduated from high school with a gold medal in 1948.&lt;ref name=solidarnost&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.solidarnost.org/thems/znamenitost/znamenitost_2691.html|author=Natalia Kochemina|accessdate=7 April 2018|date=7 March 2006|title=Я еще здесь|language=ru|journal=Solidarnost|volume=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; She had been writing poetry from her childhood onwards, but feeling that she lacked a literary talent, she decided to take up a career in languages. In 1953, she graduated from the philological department of the [[Moscow State University]]. She then entered a postgraduate programme in general and comparative linguistics, and began to work as an interpreter.&lt;ref name=colta/&gt;

Manukova married Leo Tokmakov, an illustrator. Their son, Vasily Tokmakov, also became a writer of children's fiction.

Irina Tokmakova died in Moscow on 5 April 2018.&lt;ref name=rg/&gt;

==Career==
The first literary translation into Russian undertaken by Tokmakova was a collection of Swedish [[folk songs]] for children. These had been sent to her by a visiting Swedish energy executive named Borgqvist, who had recognised her love for Swedish song. Initially, the translation was meant for her son, but Tokmakova's husband took it to a publishing house, which then printed it in the magazines ''Merry pictures'' and ''[[Murzilka]]''.&lt;ref name=rg&gt;{{cite news|url=https://rg.ru/2018/04/05/umerla-poet-i-perevodchica-irina-tokmakova.html|title=Умерла поэт и переводчица Ирина Токмакова|language=ru|author=Ivan Vladimirov|date=5 April 2018|accessdate=7 April 2018|newspaper=Rossiskaya Gazeta}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The writers [[Samuil Marshak]] and [[Agniya Barto]] saw Tokmakova's works in ''Murzilka'' and encouraged her to write and publish more. Subsequently, Leo Tokmakov illustrated many of their books.&lt;ref name=solidarnost/&gt;

To join the [[Union of Soviet Writers]], Tokmakova needed sponsorships from three members; Marshak, [[Boris Zakhoder]] and [[Valentin Berestov]] recommended her.&lt;ref name=solidarnost/&gt;

Her first book of poetry, illustrated by Leo Tokmakov, was titled''Trees'', and was published in 1962.&lt;ref name=colta&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.colta.ru/news/17753|title=Умерла Ирина Токмакова|language=ru|publisher=Colta.ru|date=6 April 2018|accessdate=7 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tokmakova was able to travel abroad to attend international seminars and conferences on children's literature. She was a juror for the [[Hans Christian Andersen Award]].&lt;ref name=solidarnost/&gt;

'''James Henry Northrop''', (8 May 1856 – 12 December 1940) was born in [[Keighley]], [[West Yorkshire]] in the United Kingdom, where he worked in the textile industry. He emigrated to [[Boston]], MA, in the USA in 1881. By 1898, working in [[Hopedale, Massachusetts]] for [[Draper Corporation|George Draper and Sons]] he had filed several hundred patents some of which were used in the [[Northrop Loom]]. He retired at 42. He died in [[Santa Ana, California]] on 12 December 1940, at 84.

==Working life==
[[File:Draper looms.jpg|thumb|A Draper loom showing a Northrop filling-changing battery (the cylinder of [[pirn]]s) in Bamberg, South Carolina]]
He started his working life in England, where he was a mechanic and factory foreman &lt;!-- term needs to be verified --&gt;  before emigrating to Massachusetts in 1881.

He moved to [[Hopedale, Massachusetts]] to work for [[Draper Corporation|George Draper and Sons]]. Here he invented the Northrop spooler guide. He unsuccessfully tried to be a chicken farmer. And it was there he worked on his shuttle-charger for Mr Otis Draper,who saw a model of the device on March 5, 1889. Draper was also developing the Rhoades shuttle-charger. Northrop was given a loom to test his idea. 
By May 20 he had concluded that his first idea was not practical, and had thought of another idea, On July 5, the completed loom was running, and as it seemed to have more advantages than the Rhoades loom. The Northrop device was given a mill trial in October 1889 at the [[Seaconnett Mills]] in [[Fall River]]. More looms were constructed.

Meanwhile he invented a self-threading shuttle and shuttle spring jaws to hold a bobbin by means of rings on the butt.  This paved the way to his filling-changing battery of 1891, the basic feature of the [[Northrop Loom]].

The development of a workable warp stop motion by other members of the Draper organization and marketing of the first Northrop looms in 1894 the textile industry achieved new levels of production.  By 1900, Draper had sold over 60,000 Northrop looms, They were shipping 1500 a month, were employing 2500 men and enlarging their works to increase that output. 
&lt;ref name="Hopedale"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.geocities.com/daninhopedale/drapernorthroploom.html|title=Cotton Chats |year=1940|accessdate=2009-01-25|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090807140857/http://geocities.com/daninhopedale/drapernorthroploom.html|archivedate=2009-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
He married to Emily Driver of Keighley, Yorkshire and had 5 daughters. The Northrop loom sold well, so he was able to retire at the age of 42. He bought a fruit farm in Santa Ana, California where he grew dates and spent his time fishing.

'''Janet Biehl''' (born September 4, 1953) is an American political writer who is the author of numerous books and articles associated with [[Social ecology (theory)|social ecology]], the body of ideas developed and publicized by [[Murray Bookchin]]. Formerly an advocate of his antistatist political program, she broke with it publicly in 2011. She works as a freelance copy editor for book publishers in New York. She currently focuses on translating, artmaking, and choral singing.

== Education ==
Biehl grew up in [[Cincinnati, Ohio]], and attended [[Wesleyan University]], graduating in 1974 as a theater major.  She studied acting as well as set and costume design at the [[Eugene O'Neill Theater Center]]. She then moved to New York City, where she appeared in off-off-Broadway productions, including the world premiere of ''[[Fefu and Her Friends]]'' by [[Maria Irene Fornes]]. Biehl studied drawing and watercolor painting at the [[Art Students League of New York]]. In 1985 she enrolled at the [[CUNY]] Graduate Center, where she earned an M.A. in liberal studies.

== Social ecology ==
In 1986 she attended the [[Institute for Social Ecology]], in Vermont, where she met the social theorist Murray Bookchin. In January 1987 she moved to [[Burlington, Vermont]], to study further with Bookchin. They began a collaborative relationship to advance and promote social ecology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cedap.assis.unesp.br/cantolibertario/textos/0022.html |title=Janet Biehl: Short Biography &amp; Selected Works |publisher=Canto Libertário |accessdate= September 19, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120402155302/http://www.cedap.assis.unesp.br/cantolibertario/textos/0022.html |archivedate= April 2, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1987 to 2003 they co-wrote and co-published the theoretical newsletter ''Green Perspectives'', later renamed ''Left Green Perspectives''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.social-ecology.org/category/social-ecology-journals/left-green-perspectives/|title=Left Green Perspectives (1988-1998)|publisher=Institute for Social Ecology|accessdate= September 19, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Biehl edited and compiled ''The Murray Bookchin Reader'' (1997), which Bookchin considered to be the best introduction to his work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dwardmac.pitzer.edu/Anarchist_Archives/bookchin/reader/intro.html|title=The Murray Bookchin Reader: Introduction|last=Biehl|first=Janet|publisher=Anarchy Archives|accessdate= September 19, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; To summarize Bookchin's ideas on assembly democracy, known as [[libertarian municipalism]], she wrote ''The Politics of Social Ecology:  Libertarian Municipalism'' (1998). She wrote numerous articles about or related to Bookchin's ideas.

Since Bookchin's death in 2006, she authored ''[[Ecology or Catastrophe|Ecology or Catastrophe: The Life of Murray Bookchin]],'' published in 2015 by [[Oxford University Press]]. In 2011 Biehl separated from social ecology, explaining that she could no longer advocate an antistatist ideology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.social-ecology.org/2011/04/biehl-breaks-with-social-ecology/|title=Biehl breaks with social ecology|last=Biehl|first=Janet|date=April 13, 2011 &lt;!-- at 6:10 am --&gt; |publisher=Institute for Social Ecology|accessdate=September 19, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; She blogged at Ecology or Catastrophe.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.biehlonbookchin.com/&lt;/ref&gt;

== Kurdish freedom movement ==
Biehl is a supporter of the Kurdish freedom movement. After [[Abdullah Öcalan]], leader of the insurgent [[Kurdistan Workers' Party]], was captured and imprisoned in 1999, he became an avid reader of Bookchin's work in Turkish translation and recommended it to the movement. Drawing on libertarian municipalism, he formulated [[democratic confederalism]] as a political program, which the PKK adopted.&lt;ref&gt;Janet Biehl, [http://new-compass.net/articles/bookchin-%C3%B6calan-and-dialectics-democracy "Bookchin, Öcalan, and the Dialectics of Democracy"], New Compass (2012).&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004 several intermediaries tried to arrange a dialogue between Bookchin and Öcalan but were unsuccessful due to Bookchin's failing health.&lt;ref&gt;Ahmed, Akbar Shahid (December 18, 2015), [http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/syrian-kurds-murray-bookchin_us_5655e7e2e4b079b28189e3df "America's Best Allies Against ISIS Are Inspired By A Bronx-Born Libertarian Socialist"], ''Huffington Post''.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012 Biehl translated (from German to English) the book ''Democratic Autonomy in North Kurdistan'' by the solidarity group TATORT Kurdistan, a field study of democratic institutions built by the Kurdish movement in southeastern Turkey to implement democratic confederalism.&lt;ref&gt;http://demokratischeautonomie.blogsport.eu/&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014 and 2015 she visited [[Rojava]], the mostly Kurdish region of northern Syria. There the Kurdish movement is attempting, in wartime conditions, to implement democratic confederalism, gender equality, and ecology.&lt;ref&gt;Wes Enzinna, [https://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/29/magazine/a-dream-of-utopia-in-hell.html?_r=0 "A Dream of Secular Utopia in ISIS' Backyard"], ''New York Times Magazine'', November 24, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;  She published several articles about her visits.&lt;ref&gt;Biehl, [http://www.biehlonbookchin.com/rojavas-communes-and-councils/ "Rojava's Communes and Councils"], January 31, 2015; [http://www.biehlonbookchin.com/revolutionary-education/ "Revolutionary Education"], February 7, 2015; [http://www.biehlonbookchin.com/rojavas-threefold-economy/ "Rojava's Threefold Economy"], February 25, 2015; [http://www.biehlonbookchin.com/thoughts-on-rojava/ "Thoughts on Rojava"], February 16, 2016; and with others, [http://www.biehlonbookchin.com/joint-statement-delegation/ "Joint Statement of the Academic Delegation"], January 17, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2016 her translation of ''Revolution in Rojava: Democratic Autonomy and Women's Liberation in Northern Syria,'' written by Michael Knapp, Anja Flach, and Ercan Ayboga, was published by Pluto Press. Biehl is currently translating (German to English) the three-volume memoirs of [[Sakine Cansız|Sakine Cansiz]], a co-founder of the PKK in 1978 and progenitor of today's strong Kurdish women's movement.

'''John Gadsby Chapman''' (December 3, 1808 – November 28, 1889) was an American artist famous for ''[[Baptism of Pocahontas]]'', which was commissioned by the [[United States Congress]] and hangs in the [[United States Capitol rotunda]].

== Life and career ==

John Chapman was born in 1808 in [[Alexandria, Virginia]].  Chapman began his study of art in [[Philadelphia]] for two years, then departed for Europe where he eventually spent time in Italy.  In 1831, Chapman returned to his hometown of Alexandria, and exhibited his artwork in the nearest metropolitan areas, such as Washington, D.C., [[Richmond, Virginia|Richmond]], and Philadelphia.  He specialized in landscapes and portraits.

By 1834, Chapman had moved to New York City and become a member of the [[National Academy of Design]], and found work as an illustrator.  In New York, Chapman embarked on a series of historical paintings, such as ''Landing at Jamestown'' and the ''Crowning of Powhatan''.  The success of these paintings helped Chapman land a commission from the [[United States Congress]] in February 1837 to paint a historical scene for the rotunda of the Capitol building.  For this work, Chapman received a total payment of $10,000.  On November 30, 1840, ''Baptism of Pocahontas'' was formally unveiled in the Capitol rotunda.

Besides historical paintings and portraits, Chapman also produced wood engravings and etchings, and frequently contributed illustrations to [[Harper (publisher)#Harper &amp; Brothers (1833–1962)|Harper Brothers']] publications. Chapman's ''American Drawing Book'', published in 1847, became a standard text for art students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.worldcat.org/title/american-drawing-book-a-manual-for-the-amateur-and-basis-of-study-for-the-professional-artist-especially-adapted-to-the-use-of-public-and-private-schools-as-well-as-home-instruction/oclc/730204?referer=di&amp;ht=edition|title=The American drawing-book: a manual for the amateur, and basis of study for the professional artist: especially adapted to the use of public and private schools, as well as home instruction.|first=J. G|last=Chapman|date=1 January 1847|publisher=J.S. Redfield|accessdate=30 May 2016|via=Open WorldCat}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the swell of these successes, Chapman moved his family to Rome, and made an earnest living selling paintings of rural [[Campania]] to American visitors.  However, at the onset of the [[American Civil War]], the tourist industry dried up, affecting Chapman's fortunes greatly.  In addition, Chapman's own son, [[Conrad Wise Chapman]], returned to America to fight on the side of the [[Confederate States of America]].

The economic deprivation inflicted on Chapman during the 1860s became insurmountable.  In Rome, he was forced to live off the kindness of fellow expatriates, and finally returned to America, sick and poor, to spend his last days with another son, John Linton Chapman, in [[Brooklyn, New York]].  It was there, in 1889, that he died a pauper.

The Glasgow Story.&lt;/ref&gt; Hopps was a convinced spiritualist and was influenced by [[William Howitt]] and [[C. F. Varley]]. He had unified his unitarianism with spiritualism by arguing the [[bible]] was a record of spirit communication.&lt;ref name="Watts"/&gt;

In a lecture for the [[London Spiritualist Alliance]], Hopps supported biological [[evolution]] and spiritualism.&lt;ref&gt;Oppenheim, Janet. (1988).

I think that as [to] questions relating to peace and war, social purity, and the doing of equal justice to all, they would help us on.

'''John Porter East''' (May 5, 1931 – June 29, 1986) was a [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] [[United States Senate|U.S. senator]] from the state of [[North Carolina]] from 1981 until his [[suicide]] in 1986.

A [[paraplegic]] since 1955, because of [[polio]], East was a [[professor]] of [[political science]] at [[East Carolina University]] in [[Greenville, North Carolina|Greenville]] and a protégé of conservative Senator [[Jesse Helms]]. East ran unsuccessfully for a vacancy in the [[United States House of Representatives]] in a [[special election]] in 1966, a race won by [[Walter B. Jones, Sr.]].

In 1980, with the benefit of [[Ronald Reagan]]'s North Carolina influence, East narrowly defeated incumbent [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] Senator [[Robert Burren Morgan]], largely on the strength of political advertising about Morgan's involvement with the turnover of the [[Panama Canal]] to the government of [[Panama]]. In the Senate, he earned a reputation as a staunch [[Social conservatism|social conservative]], especially on the issue of [[abortion]]. Alongside [[Jesse Helms]], East led opposition to the bill to create a [[Martin Luther King, Jr. Day|federal holiday to honor Martin Luther King, Jr.]] in 1983.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Romero|first=Frances|title=A Brief History Of Martin Luther King Jr. Day|url=http://www.time.com/time/nation/article/0,8599,1872501,00.html|newspaper=Time|date=January 18, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1986, he announced that he would not seek re-election, and would instead return to his teaching position. That summer, East, suffering from [[hypothyroidism]], killed himself (for reasons that are still unclear) at his North Carolina home.

== Early life and education ==
John Porter East was born in [[Springfield, Illinois]] on May 5, 1931, the son of an employee of the State of Illinois.&lt;ref name="clifford"&gt;{{cite news|last=Clifford|first=Garry|title=It's Still An Uphill Struggle but Senator John East Persisted to Become 'Helms on Wheels'|url=http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20078720,00.html|accessdate=February 21, 2012|newspaper=People|date=March 2, 1981}}&lt;/ref&gt; He received his [[Bachelor of Arts]] degree from [[Earlham College]] in Indiana where he was left tackle on the football team. After his graduation in 1953, he married Priscilla Sherk and was commissioned as an officer in the [[United States Marine Corps]]. In 1955, East contracted [[polio]] while serving at [[Marine Corps Base Camp Lejeune|Camp Lejeune]]. He would never walk again.&lt;ref name="clifford"/&gt; He received a [[LL.B.]] degree from the [[University of Illinois College of Law]] and practiced law in [[Naples, Florida]] for one year. He went on to receive his M.A. and Ph.D. in Political Science from the [[University of Florida]].

== Death ==
On Friday, June 27, 1986, Senator East completed work on the book galleys of his collected essays. He met with [[United States Supreme Court|Supreme Court]] nominee [[Antonin Scalia]]. Then, commitments met, the Senator drove to [[Greenville, NC|Greenville]] with his aide, John Petree, and arrived home about noon on Saturday. Petree stayed with him until daughter Kathryn arrived for a visit. Kathryn left her father "in good spirits" about midnight. Petree returned to East's house on Sunday morning, June 29. He found the front door ajar. The senator was dead in his garage, a victim of suicide by [[carbon monoxide]] poisoning.&lt;ref&gt;"N.C. Sen. John East is apparent suicide," ''The Stars and Stripes'' (European edition), June 30, 1986, p1&lt;/ref&gt;
North Carolina [[Governor]] [[James G. Martin]] appointed [[U.S. Representative]] [[James Thomas Broyhill]] to serve out the rest of East's term. Broyhill was later defeated in his election bid in November 1986 by former Democratic Governor [[Terry Sanford]].

East is buried in [[Arlington National Cemetery]].

The Kakorvi Shaikhs are a [[Muslim]] community found in the state of [[Uttar Pradesh]] in [[India]]. They are also found in the province of [[Sindh]] in [[Pakistan]], particularly the city of [[Karachi]].&lt;ref name="People of India"&gt;''People of India: Uttar Pradesh'', Volume XLII, edited by A. Hasan &amp; J. C. Das, p. 1301.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History and origin==

The town of [[Kakori]] in [[Lucknow district]] is home to a number of [[Alavi (surname)|Alavi]] and [[Abbasid Caliphate|Abbasi]] families, and word Kakorvi Shaikh literally means the [[Shaikhs in South Asia|Shaikhs]] of the town of [[Kakori]]. The term Shaikh ([[Arabic language|Arabic]]: {{rtl-lang|ar|شيخ}}, ''shaykh''; [[plural|pl.]] {{rtl-lang|ar|شيوخ}} ''shuyūkh''), is a word or [[honorific]] term in the [[Arabic language]] that literally means "[[Elder (administrative title)|elder]]." It is commonly used to designate an elder of a [[tribe]], a revered wise man, or an [[Ulema|Islamic scholar]]. In [[India]], the Shaikh title is used by the descendants of [[Arab people|Arab]] and other Muslim immigrants who settled in [[South Asia]], and signifies Arab descent. From the beginning of [[Muslim]] rule in [[South Asia]] in 713 AD, technocrats, bureaucrats, soldiers, traders, scientists, architects, teachers, theologians and [[Sufi]]s flocked from the rest of the  Muslim world, to the [[Delhi Sultanate|Islamic Sultanate]] in [[South Asia]] and settled permanently. The descendants of these [[Arab people|Arab]]s usually use the title of ''Shaikh''. These [[Shaikhs in South Asia|Shaikh]] family often claim descent from the early [[Caliph]]s of [[Islam]].&lt;ref name="People of India" /&gt;

The of Kakorvi Shaikh are sometimes referred to as Moulvizadigan (Moulvis) and Makhdoomzadigan (Makhdooms), [[Alavis]] indicating that they are descendants of [[Mullah]] Abu Bakr Jami Alavi, who settled in Kakori in 1461 and/or descendants of Qari Amir Saifuddin Alavi, who settled in Kakori in 1512.They belong by and large to the [[Alavi (surname)|Alavi]] and [[Abbasid Caliphate|Abbasi]] families, who settled in the [[Awadh]] region from the 12th.Century onwards. According to a classical [[Urdu]] work, the ''Nafhatun Nasim'', which is a record of scions of a 16th-century sage Mullah Abdul Karim Alavi and which was later published by Amir Ahmed Alavi in 1934, and is an historic account of the settlement of these Alavi Shaikhs in the town of [[Kakori]]. The name Alavi ({{lang-ar|علوي}}) signifies ancestry from [[Ali ibn Abi Talib]] ({{lang-ar|علي بن أﺑﻲ طالب}}), the fourth [[Caliph]] of [[Sunni]] [[Islam]] and the first [[Imam]] in [[Shia]] Islam. [[Ali]] was the cousin and son-in-law of [[Muhammad]]. In addition, the other major group Shaikh settled in [[Kakori]] are the Abbasis. The name denotes descent from [[Abbas ibn Abd-al-Muttalib]], the paternal uncle of Muhammad. The [[Abbasid caliphate]] was established by the Abbasi clan and ruled the [[Middle East]] during 750–1258AD (510 years). The Hashmities are mainly in Karachi. 

==Genealogies==

The ''Abbasiyan-i- Kakori'', is the family tree of Kakorian Abbasi families by Muhammad Hasan Abbasi which was published in 1945. In its present form, ''Hashimites of Kakori'' contains genealogical records of an intricate familial hierarchy that evolved predominantly from three houses, the ''Moulvis, Makhdooms'' [cf [[Alavi (surname)|Alavi]]] and ''Qazis'' [cf Abbasi].  The [[patriarchs]] of all three houses  were émigrés hailing from the Banu Hashim clan [cf [[Hashemites]]] of the Quraysh tribe of [[Hejaz]] (in present-day Saudi Arabia) [''cf'' [[Banu Quraysh]]], who settled in Kakori since the early advent of Islam in the region, back in the 15th century.

Their ensuing generations, being passionate in their resolve to protect their Arab heritage, have fostered matrimonial alliances preferentially with the people of authentic Arab descent to embrace allies into their folds, thereby, cultivating a very tradition-bound society with its home in Kakori until the [[diaspora]] following the foundation of [[Pakistan]] in 1947. Today, ''Kakorian Hashimites'' are spread far and wide across Australia, Canada, Europe, India, Middle East, Pakistan, UK, and USA.  The website ''Hashimites of Kakori'', compiled and hosted by Dr. Misbahuddin Zafar Alavi of Canada since 2006, is one of the largest listing of Alavi and Abbasi families comprising over 10,000 interlinked records spanning almost 1600 years showing in some cases 50 generations of [[Alavi (surname)|Alavi]] and 60 generations of Abbasi families.

María Santos Corrales was born on November 1, 1797 ([[All Saint's Day]]) in [[Arequipa, Peru]].  She was the daughter of José Corrales and Sanabría Manuela Salazar.  María Santos and Mariano Melgar knew each other due to their kinship – their fathers were first cousins.  Their bonds of kinship were reinforced on February 8, 1812, with the marriage of María Santos's brother (Romualdo) and Mariano's sister (María Josefa).  Only 14 years old at the time, María Santos rejected any romantic advances by Mariano Melgar (who was 21).  Disillusioned, Mariano left Arequipa and eventually joined the pro-revolutionary forces.  He fought at the Battle of Umachiri, where he was captured by royalist forces and executed on March 12, 1815.

On November 24, 1819, María Santos Corrales married a veteran of the Battle of Umachiri and soldier in arms of Mariano Melgar – Dr. and Col. Manuel Amat y León.  They had nine children.  María Santos Corrales died on March 8, 1881, in Arequipa, Peru at the age of 83.

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Mawlana Faizani.jpg|frame|thumb|Faizani]] --&gt;

'''Muhammad Atta-ullah Faizani''' was an Afghan Islamic scholar. He was born 17 April 1923 (the twenty-first day of [[Ramadan]] of that year) in [[Herat]], [[Afghanistan]] to a family of ''miagan'' (religious scholars descended from a great Islamic saint). The honorific "Faizani", a derivation of an Arabic word which denotes something that overflows with God's light (blessings), was bestowed upon him by the imam of the [[Kaaba]] during his [[Hajj]].

==Early education and profession==
As a child Faizani was home-schooled in the traditional Afghan manner. Entering his teens, Faizani studied at a High School in [[Herat]] and finally at [[Kabul University]], where he graduated in 1941. For eight years following his graduation he served as a High School principal in his hometown until a passion for God overcame him. At this time Faizani left home and traveled widely throughout the Islamic world of the mid-20th century seeking knowledge of Islam and its various practices.
°

==Spiritual retreat==
As this period of traveling drew to a close, there came an intensification of his spiritual rigor and practices. He returned to Herat and secluded himself within a cave at a local mosque. There he remained for five years performing ascetic practices including long periods of [[fasting]], ''[[Zhikr]]'' and ''fikr'' (also called ''taffakkur'' or deep contemplation). ''Taffakkur'' is a technique by which the practitioner "contemplates the Magnificence and Perfection of Glorious God in the creation."

==The Mazari Sharif sermons and his first imprisonment==
After a spiritual incident at the end of his ascetic practices, he began wandering again and wound up in [[Mazari Sharif]]. Upon arriving in the city, Faizani was overcome by the overt materialism of the elite and their unIslamic practices, based more upon tribalism and traditional power structures than upon brotherhood and religious sentiment. In response, Faizani began preaching, filling his sermons with the fire of moral and spiritual discontent. His critical sermons addressed the corrupt political practices that surrounded the people of Mazar-i-Sharif and he spared neither cleric, nor government official, nor the landlords who participated in the crude feudalism of their country of that time. However, as is the norm when spiritual luminaries criticize established authorities in "developing" nations, Faizani quickly became a target for men of great power who did not want to upset the status quo.

He was arrested and put in prison.

==Becoming a sheikh==
After his first imprisonment, his public life consisted of good works (charity, teaching, and spreading [[Islam]]), exercising public responsibility, and suffering short prison sentences for upsetting the secular authorities. Between these incarcerations, Faizani was able to create a library in [[Puli Khumri|Pul-i-Khumri]] (in [[Baghlan Province]]). It was here that Faizani attracted a large following of professionals (teachers and government officials), military personnel, and students. In time, his followers encompassed both [[Sunni]] and [[Shiite]] [[Muslims]], an accomplishment not repeated by other groups in Afghanistan. To this day, the school of Islam that he initiated, the Madrassa-e Tawheed, consists of both Sunnis and Shi'ites.

The philosophy of the Madrassa-e Tawheed was unique in Afghanistan and promulgated the fusion of modern science and religion, hence its attraction among the young university students of that time who required more from Islam than just interpretations and ''[[fatwa]]s'' given by the established, traditional ''[[mullah]]s'' out of touch with modern developments in science, technology, and politics. Additionally, the ''[[madrassa]]'' developed an intensive program of ''Zhikr'' (remembrance of [[Allah]]) and ''Fikr'' (''tafakkur''), which was also well-suited to military personnel stationed in far-flung and out of the way locales (a common occurrence in Afghanistan).

==The move to Kabul==
In 1969, Faizani organized the Religious Scholars' Uprising at the [[Pul-i Khisti mosque]] in [[Kabul]]. Although the authorities thought that this protest would dissipate after a short while, the protest grew in numbers and persisted for weeks. To halt the demonstrations, the government cracked down on the restive demonstrators and imprisoned many of the protest's leaders, including Faizani. This was to be Faizani's fifth stint in prison and lasted a year and a half.

Upon his release, Faizani purchased a building next to the Pul-i Khisti mosque and started a library and book business selling only those books that he had actually read himself. At this time, Faizani also organized and managed [[zikr]] circles and invited members of the government, military, and scholastic institutions. The intention being to transform society by first transforming the self. It was through these meetings that Faizani eventually formed the political party Hizb-i Tawheed.

==Final imprisonment==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:faizani behind bars kabul.jpg|frame|thumb|Faizani In Jail]] --&gt;

To eliminate Faizani's strong influence among the upper echelons of Afghan society (especially among the military elites), in 1973 [[Mohammed Daoud Khan|President Daoud]] of [[Afghanistan]] and his Communist advisors accused the Hizb-i Tawheed of organizing a [[coup d'etat]]. This accusation led to the final imprisonment of Faizani and hundreds of his disciples. It was during this last imprisonment that he suffered the cruelest tortures, including having his beard plucked out one hair at a time, being continually whipped, electrocuted, and having his teeth crushed.

All through this time, Faizani continually wrote books to his followers and would have each page secretly spirited out by his visitors. These pages would later be collected and the books published. In total, he is credited with having written 52 books on topics as diverse as ''taffakkur'' (''fikr''), ''Zikr'', ''[[Fiqh]]'', conditional and unconditional worship, etc.

Faizani disappeared from prison in 1979 shortly after the communist [[Khalq]]is came to power. It is believed by some {{By whom|date= April 2012}} that he was executed by this regime.

The continuation of his work and teachings since then has been strongly supported in established schools in Afghanistan and in other countries by his students, led by his son, Ustad Mazhabi Sahib. The Madrassa-e Tawheed continues to this day and has established schools in various Western nations including large numbers in Germany, France, Canada, and the United States.

==Education==
His religious learning includes:
* [[Tafsir]]: Interpretations, Jalalayn, Khazin, Roohul Ma'anee, Jamal and Roohul Bayan.
* Books of [[Hadith]]: Sahih ([[Sahih Bukhari|Bukharee]] and [[Sahih Muslim|Muslim]]), Mishkat, [[Tirmidhi]], [[Sunan Abi Da'ud|Sunayn Abu-Daoud]] and [[Ibn Maja|Ibn-Maja]]
* Spiritual sciences of Faith and Belief, Politics, [[fiqh|Jurisprudence]], [[Sharia|Islamic Law]], [[Dhikr|Remembrance]] and Contemplation.

Faizani speaks [[Pashtu|Pashto]], [[Persian language|Persian]], and Arabic. His son, Ustad Mazhabi Sahib (the present leader of Madrassa-e Tawheed), speaks Pashto, Persian, Arabic, and English.

==Body of work==
Faizani has written fifty two volumes covering the various spiritual sciences. He is unique in that his teachings discuss 20th century faith and how the practitioner must use science and the creation as experienced through the five senses to establish the proof and certainty of belief in God.

The titles of seven volumes which make up a special series of "Goblets for the fortification faith", are:
* 1. General Questions on Faith, Mankind and the World
* 2. Knowing Oneself - Knowing God
* 3. Magnificence and Perfection of Glorious Artificer in Arts
* 4. Man and the Secrets of Nearness
* 5. Man and the Philosophy of Test
* 6. The Secrets of Creation up to the Court of Greatness
* 7. Alphabet of the Secrets of the Qur'an

The common point in all the writer's works is that all topics are extracted from the [[Qur'an]], and are strongly affirmed by Qur'anic understanding. The works include references to relevant Qur'anic verses and [[hadith]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13565">The French actor, writer, manager and director, [[Sacha Guitry]] had a prolific output of plays and films. His stage works range from historical dramas to contemporary light comedies. Some have musical scores, by composers including [[André Messager]] and [[Reynaldo Hahn]]. During the era of silent films Guitry avoided them, finding the lack of spoken dialogue fatal to dramatic impact. From the 1930s to the end of his life he enthusiastically embraced the cinema, making as many as five films in a single year.

==Casting==
A seven-year-old McCullough was one of three actresses narrowed down for the part of five-year-old Robin, and was brought in to screen test with her on-screen parents [[Finola Hughes]] ([[Anna Devane]]) and [[Tristan Rogers]] ([[Robert Scorpio]]).&lt;ref name="MSN Interview"&gt;{{cite web|last=Barnert|first=Deanna|title=McCullough and Hughes Talk Reunion and Robin's Exit|url=http://social.entertainment.msn.com/tv/blogs/tv-buzz-blogpost.aspx?post=c5db4f9f-8964-4a55-8bdc-9255ccdc7842|work=[[MSN TV]]|publisher=social.entertainment.msn.com|accessdate=September 9, 2012|date=February 8, 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120221020045/http://social.entertainment.msn.com/tv/blogs/tv-buzz-blogpost.aspx?post=c5db4f9f-8964-4a55-8bdc-9255ccdc7842|archivedate=February 21, 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hughes recalled the event to [[MSN TV]]: "We just started improvising with her, like anything. We were throwing things at her and she was just talking away. Tristan and I were looking at each other over her head going, 'This is it! This is what we wanted.'"&lt;ref name="MSN Interview" /&gt; Improvisation skills were key for ''General Hospital'''s process in the 1980s. As Hughes explained: "It was very improvised. Very loose. We used to just talk around the plot and maybe every now and again dip our toe in the actual storyline."&lt;ref name="MSN Interview" /&gt;

McCullough debuted on September 6, 1985, and stayed with the series until September 12, 1996.&lt;ref name="SOD stats"/&gt; Afterwards, she returned as a series regular for brief stints: January 17, 1997 to February 3, 1997; March 12, 1997 to April 8, 1997; June 23, 1997 to August 8, 1997; December 11, 1997 to January 20, 1999; June 20–21, 2000 (for [[Port Charles (fictional city)#The Nurses.27 Ball|The Nurses' Ball]]); and July 16, 2004.

In 1993, Robin meets [[Stone Cates|Michael "Stone" Cates]] ([[Michael Sutton (actor)|Michael Sutton]]), and although they initially do not get along, they began dating in 1994 against her Uncle Mac's wishes. Stone had been a street kid now taken in and working for [[Sonny Corinthos]] ([[Maurice Benard]]). In 1995, Stone learns he is HIV+ and eventually contracts [[AIDS]] due to his length of time without treatment. After his first HIV test came back negative, he did not take another one six months later. Robin and her family are shocked to learn that she is also [[HIV]]+. Robin and Stone fall deeply in love, and she is devastated when Stone eventually dies from [[AIDS]]. Robin is at [[Jason Morgan (General Hospital)|Jason Morgan]] ([[Steve Burton (actor)|Steve Burton]])'s bedside when he wakes up from a coma following a car accident caused by his brother {{nowrap|[[A. J. Quartermaine]]}} ([[Sean Kanan]]). A few months later, they begin to bond and start dating. Jason helps Robin cope with Stone's death and her medical status, while Robin helps Jason cope with his memory loss following the accident. They fall in love despite protests from her uncle [[Mac Scorpio]] ([[John J. York]]). She introduces him to [[Sonny Corinthos]], soon his employer, and the three become friends. Robin eventually enrolls in school at Yale, returning on weekends and holidays to visit. After an emotional break-up with Jason due to his involvement with the mob, Robin leaves Port Charles. She returns in 1998 to help her best friend [[Brenda Barrett]] ([[Vanessa Marcil]]) from her recent break-up. During this time, Robin becomes friends with [[Nikolas Cassadine]] ([[Tyler Christopher (actor)|Tyler Christopher]]) and the two bond over their similar childhoods. Robin reconciles with Jason and they move in together with baby [[Michael Corinthos|Michael]], who Jason is taking care of for his friend [[Carly Corinthos|Carly]]. However, their relationship begins to deteriorate when Carly moves home and into their cottage. Robin eventually reveals to Jason's brother A.J. ([[Billy Warlock]]) that he (and not Jason) is the father of Carly's son. Jason is furious and they end their relationship. Robin leaves town heartbroken in 1999, moving to [[Paris]]. In 2001, Robin travels to [[Pine Valley (All My Children)|Pine Valley]], [[Pennsylvania]] where she is reunited with her mother Anna.

=== 2005–15 ===
Robin returns to Port Charles in 2005 to help save Jason Morgan's life, and brings [[Patrick Drake]] ([[Jason Thompson (actor)|Jason Thompson]]) to town to operate. Robin and Patrick bicker and flirt, and eventually start dating despite Patrick's anti-commitment reputation. They work together during an [[encephalitis]] outbreak in February 2006. The crisis brings Robin's presumed-dead father to town, Robert Scorpio ([[Tristan Rogers]]), but he leaves shortly thereafter. Robin sees him again when she joins [[Lulu Spencer]] (then [[Julie Marie Berman]]) and [[Dillon Quartermaine]] ([[Scott Clifton]]) to the Markham Islands to rescue Robert and [[Luke Spencer]] ([[Anthony Geary]]). She also sees her mother [[Anna Devane]], having previously found out she was alive and reunited with her in 2001 in [[Pine Valley (All My Children)|Pine Valley]]. Meanwhile, Robin and Patrick admit their love for one another. In late 2006, they help Luke Spencer reconnect with his [[catatonic]] wife, [[Laura Spencer (General Hospital)|Laura]], with an experimental drug. In early 2007, Robin is part of a group held hostage at the Metro Court Hotel and is shot in the abdomen because the district attorney was Sonny's half-brother [[Ric Lansing]] ([[Rick Hearst]]). A few months later, Robin realizes she wants to have a child while Patrick strongly does not, and they break up after befriending Ric. In late 2007, after the funeral of her cousin [[Georgie Jones]] ([[Lindze Letherman]]), Robin goes to Patrick for comfort and they sleep together. Robin discovers she is pregnant, but does not tell Patrick since she had been planning on using a [[sperm donor]]. Patrick figures out the truth, and the couple slowly starts to become close again. In the summer of 2008, Robin's father is diagnosed with [[colon cancer]] but pulls through. Patrick proposes to Robin but she turns him down. They eventually plan an October wedding, which is cut short when Robin goes into labor. Robin names the baby [[Emma Drake|Emma Grace Scorpio-Drake]], who, after a brief scare, is shown not to be infected by Robin's HIV. Patrick and Robin wed the day after Christmas.

In early 2009, Robin begins suffering from [[postpartum depression]]. After months of refusing help, she agrees to treatment and eventually bonds with her daughter. In early 2010, Robin and Patrick begin to bicker. In June, Robin takes a trip to [[Africa]] to help with an [[AIDS]] program. Patrick is upset to not be included in her decision, and voices his jealousy over her connection to her late boyfriend Stone. The night Robin returns, Patrick sleeps with [[Lisa Niles]] ([[Brianna Brown]]). Lisa slowly begins to show her jealousy after Patrick refuses to sleep with her again. Lisa cuts Robin out of photos, steals Robin's HIV medicine and takes Emma from the babysitter. Patrick confesses his affair to Robin and she kicks him out of the house. She confronts Lisa, who then intentionally jumps in front of Robin's car and claims Robin tried to kill her. Lisa replaces Robin's medication with sedatives, resulting in Robin crashing her car. Lisa kidnaps her, and Robin escapes but falls in a well. Suffering from exhaustion and [[hypothermia]], she hallucinates Stone. Patrick eventually finds Robin, with Lisa close after him. Lisa attempts to shoot herself and is sent to a mental institution. She returns shortly, having passed her psychiatric evaluations. After Emma's birthday party, a fire starts and Lisa saves Robin and Emma. Robin accuses Lisa of starting the fire, and Lisa petitions to have Robin fired. Robin's cousin [[Maxie Jones]] ([[Kirsten Storms]]) catches Lisa attempting to inject Robin's IV bag with [[sodium pentothal]], and Lisa flees. She is put on probation and her petition against Robin is dismissed.

In early 2011, Robin serves as the maid of honor at Sonny's wedding to [[Brenda Barrett]]. Brenda is kidnapped and injected with a [[neurotoxin]], and Robin saves her with an antidote. Patrick comforts Robin during the crisis and they begin to repair their relationship. When [[Jacob Spencer|Jake Spencer]] is hit by a car and dies, Robin realizes life is short and reconciles with Patrick. Lisa attempts to kill Robin and frame Patrick, but they figure out her plan and she is arrested. In late June 2011, Lisa holds Robin, Patrick, Steve and Maxie hostage at General Hospital. Eventually there is a struggle where Lisa lets Patrick inject her with drain cleaner. She falls into a coma. Meanwhile, Robin is appointed Chief of Staff. When [[Jasper Jacks]] ([[Ingo Rademacher]]) kidnaps his daughter [[Josslyn Jacks]], he goes to Robin for help. Sonny finds them and accidentally shoots Robin in the arm instead of Jax. In October, Robin and Patrick join Matt, Elizabeth, [[Steven Webber]] ([[Scott Reeves]]) and [[Olivia Falconeri]] ([[Lisa LoCicero]]) on a boat to celebrate Matt's medical achievement. Lisa sneaks on board and ties up Patrick and Robin. Lisa tries to inject Patrick with Robin's blood, but Robin and Lisa struggle and Lisa runs away. Lisa is found dead and everyone becomes suspects. In December, Robin tells Jason her HIV meds are not working. She later works on a protocol to save Jason, who is again experiencing head trauma. She is caught in a lab explosion and presumed dead, later seen being held captive. Her captor is seen to be [[Ewen Keenan]] ([[Nathin Butler]]), later revealed to be working for [[Jerry Jacks]] ([[Sebastian Roché]]) because she was rid of by [[Joe Scully, Jr.]] ([[Richard Steinmetz]]). She is later seen being held captive by [[Duke Lavery]] ([[Ian Buchanan]]), shown to be [[Cesar Faison]] (Anders Hove) in disguise. After Faison is apprehended, his accomplice [[Liesl Obrecht|Dr. Obrecht]] ([[Kathleen Gati]]) tries to kill Robin, and her father Robert catches her. They struggle and Robert is injected, falling into a coma. Obrecht escapes with Robin and takes her to Jerry.

Robin is revealed to be held on Cassadine Island by Jerry, forced to find a cure for Jerry's illness in late 2013 after she was ordered to revive his henchman [[Franco (General Hospital)|Franco]] ([[Roger Howarth]]). Robin is eventually found by Nikolas, who came to Cassadine Island to find Dr. Obrecht. However, Jerry manages to trap her parents, also pursuing Obrecht, and tells Robin to develop the cure or her parents will die. Robin is held captive on Wyndemere by Faison and Obrecht with Nikolas and [[Britt Westbourne]] ([[Kelly Thiebaud]]), Obrecht's daughter with Faison right where [[General Hospital characters (2010s)#Stephen Clay|Stephen Clay]] ([[Michael Easton]]; AKA Caleb Morley) was. Robin finds out that Patrick is engaged to [[Sabrina Santiago]] ([[Teresa Castillo]]) after [[Carlos Rivera]] ([[Jeffrey Vincent Parise]]), [[Ava Jerome]] ([[Maura West]]), and [[Julian Jerome]] ([[William deVry]]) told Patrick and Sonny that they saw Robin alive. Britt offers to help her find the cure by getting her access to the hospital lab because [[Kate Howard|Connie Falconeri]] ([[Kelly Sullivan (actress)|Kelly Sullivan]]) was killed. Anna and Robert manage to escape, overpower Jerry, and manage to capture Faison and Obrecht. Robin immediately leaves to go to Patrick and Sabrina's wedding ceremony, where she shares a reunion with Patrick and Emma. She also shares a reunion with Maxie, who was at the time, contemplating a suicide attempt. Meanwhile, Robin asks Sabrina to break up with Patrick, but Sabrina refuses, saying Patrick should make his own decision. Eventually, Patrick chooses Robin and they reunite in time to celebrate Christmas as a family with Emma and happy to see her longtime friend Sonny Corinthos after he got released from prison and meeting Obrecht from his cell. Robin applies to be the chief of staff, but before that, she told Sonny that she's very sorry for his loss, after she told him that, then she goes on to get that chief of staff position, but is overlooked, after Obrecht secures the position following her own deal with the WSB. Patrick and Robin find out Sabrina's pregnant, but she claims that Patrick is not the baby's father. Robin then gets a visit from [[Victor Cassadine]] ([[Thaao Penghlis]]), who reveals he's the WSB director who arranged Obrecht's release. He tells Robin he wants her to revive his sister-in-law, [[Helena Cassadine|Helena]] ([[Constance Towers]]) and nephew, [[Stavros Cassadine]] ([[Robert Kelker-Kelly]]) just like she did with Franco. After refusing to help Victor, he reveals that he has also been holding Jason, and that Robin could revive him as well, if she helped in resurrecting Helena and Stavros. They leave town together on March 4, 2014, and head to the Crichton-Clark Clinic in [[New York City]] and she hadn't got a chance to say goodbye to her longtime friend Sonny. Robin later confirms that Jason is indeed alive.

On August 5, 2014, Patrick runs into Robin at the Crichton-Clark Clinic. He was there with [[Sam Morgan (General Hospital)|Sam Morgan]] looking for answers on a former patient, [[Nina Clay]] ([[Michelle Stafford]]). Robin tells him that she can't leave the clinic. Patrick then see a cryogenic chamber, and he asks if Jason is in there. Robin says that it is [[Stavros Cassadine]], and that Jason is not there. She tells Patrick that Jason's organs were failing, and he soon died. Patrick then leaves after Robin says her work is more important than her family. [[Victor Cassadine]] later comes to the lab on August 7, 2014. He tells Robin that he hopes Patrick doesn't find out about Jason. It is confirmed that Jason indeed alive, and Robin lied to Patrick. Victor reveals he asked [[Rafe Kovich, Jr.]] (Jimmy Deshler) to run Patrick and Emma off the road as a warning to Robin, showing he's holding her hostage. The accident ultimately led to the death of Patrick's son, Gabriel. Robin last appears talking to Jason in the cryogenic chamber. At the clinic, Victor orders Robin to use her new concoction on Jason. But she prefers using it on his relatives, [[Helena Cassadine]] or [[Stavros Cassadine]] instead. Victor refuses, and orders her to try it on Jason first to see if he wakes up or not, before trying it on the Cassadines. Victor calls in his goons to hold back Robin while he tries her new formula on Jason by injecting him with the serum. Robin asks Victor to let her and Jason leave after her formula works and Jason moves his hand, but Victor has other plans for Jason and gets his goons to throw Robin out, betraying her by telling her he doesn't need her anymore as her work is done and he's planning to keep Jason. After the goons take Robin out, Jason commences to rise from the chamber. She was handcuffed to a metal pole by [[Levi Dunkleman]] ([[Zachary Garred]]; actually Peter Harrell, Jr.) in helping Victor in stealing [[Felicia Scorpio-Jones]] ([[Kristina Wagner]])'s Aztec jewelry.

==Robin's Diary==
In November 1995 ABC Daytime Press released a book, ''Robin's Diary'', written by [[Judith Pinsker]], based on the storyline concerning Scorpio and [[Stone Cates]]. The work is written in a diary format and is based on the diary that the character keeps during her youth, which Scorpio gave to Cates at one point in the series. The book also includes items given to or created by Cates. ''Robin's Diary'' became a best seller and some of the book's royalties were donated to the [[Pediatric AIDS Foundation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Bidwell|first1=Carol|title=`General Hospital' raises funds to fight pediatric AIDS|url=http://www.deseretnews.com/article/636489/General-Hospital-raises-funds-to-fight-pediatric-AIDS.html?pg=all|accessdate=11 December 2016|publisher=Deseret News|date=June 18, 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Waggett|first1=Gerry|title=The One Life to Live 40th Anniversary Trivia Book|date=2008|publisher=Hyperion Books|isbn=9781401323097|page=30|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FxIAmjBPZCQC&amp;pg=PA30&amp;dq=%22Robin%27s+Diary%22+General+Hospital&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj33dWgvOvQAhXCUiYKHXp_DooQ6AEILDAD#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Robin's%20Diary%22%20General%20Hospital&amp;f=false|accessdate=11 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Shirley Kwan''', '''Kwan Suk'E''', or '''Kwan Suk Yee''' ({{zh|t=關淑怡|s=关淑怡|p=Guān Shúyí}}, born 15 August 1966) is an influential [[Cantopop]] singer from [[Hong Kong]]. Kwan first shot to fame in 1989 with the hit, "[[Happy Are Those In Love (album)|Happy Are Those In Love]]" (難得有情人) and was widely popular throughout the early to mid-90s. She is noted for her distinct, whispery vocal style and known equally for singing mainstream ballads and more alternative songs.

==Early life==
Kwan was born in Hong Kong and moved to Los Angeles at the age of twelve. She studied fashion before venturing into the entertainment industry in 1986, at the age of 20.&lt;ref name=hkmag&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hk-magazine.com/events/article/cantopop-star-shirley-kwan|title=Cantopop Star Shirley Kwan|last=Pong|first=Johannes|date=2007-02-15|publisher=[[HK Magazine]]|accessdate=2015-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Music career==

===1986-1988: Early years===

Kwan had her first taste of the limelight in 1986 when she became one of twelve finalists in [[TVB]]'s [[New Talent Singing Awards]], along with [[Andy Hui]] and [[Leon Lai]], but lost to both. Two years later, with the encouragement of a friend, she recorded a demo tape for the prestigious "Marine Blue" singing competition in Japan and won. She caught the eyes of record executives at Apollon and signed a contract, releasing two Japanese pop albums in two years. Kwan sang in both Japanese and English for these releases, and notably made her first and only rap vocals in the song "Borderless".&lt;ref name=hkmag /&gt;

===1989-1995: PolyGram period===

Kwan's Marine Blue success in Japan quickly led to her discovery by [[PolyGram]]. In 1 March 1989, Kwan released her debut Cantonese album "Winter Love" (冬戀), with its R&amp;B-influenced first single, "The Rebel" (叛逆漢子).

Her sophomore album, "[[Happy Are Those In Love (album)|Happy Are those in Love]]", would produce her first major hit with its title track, which immediately propelled Kwan into Hong Kong stardom. The song "Happy are Those in Love" was the theme song to a popular day-time drama series on TVB. It reached no. 1 on the TVB charts and was frequently requested in karaoke bars at the time. The album, which sold platinum, enjoyed huge chart success and spawned a further hit single, the up-tempo "Lovers Underneath the Stars" (星空下的戀人), with Kwan sweeping newcomer awards at all of the major year-end music award shows. 

The following two years saw the release of four albums, in which Kwan started to develop a more individualistic style. After scoring another major pop hit in 1990 with 愛恨纏綿, Kwan began incorporating elements from a wider variety of musical genres. Her 1991 album ''Love is Forever'' (戀一世的愛) saw her exploring [[New Age]] music, with cover versions of songs by [[Gregorian (band)|Gregorian]] and [[Michael Cretu]]. As a marketing strategy, [[PolyGram]] presented its title track, which was a cover version of "Once In A Life Time," back to back with the Gregorian original on the promotional disc that was sent out to radio DJs at the time. Kwan also covered Amina's 1991 winning [[Eurovision]] entry, "[[C'est le dernier qui a parlé qui a raison|Le dernier qui a parle]]", rewritten by veteran lyricist [[Andrew Lam (lyricist)|Andrew Lam]] (林敏驄) as "Buddhist Chant" (梵音), which became a surprising top 10 radio single.

In 18 November 1993, Kwan released the platinum-selling album, "The Story of Shirley" (真假情話), which spawned the minor hit "Fake Love" (假的戀愛). The album signalled a change in vocal style, with a whispery delivery that featured more prominently than before, and which would become her trademark style. 

Kwan further established her place as a cantopop diva with the album, "[[My Way (Shirley Kwan album)|My Way]]", released in 8 July 1994. This would be the last album containing all original Cantonese material until ''Shirley's Era'' in 2009. Singles included the acid-jazz influenced "Death of a Legend" (逝去的傳奇) which sampled a riff from the [[Digable Planets]]' 1993 single "Rebirth of Slick," and the immensely popular ballad "Cuddling Underneath the Stars" (繾綣星光下), another of Kwan's major career hits, which won numerous song awards at the ceremonies that year. The album also featured two of Andrew Lam's techno and house inflected compositions "Anxiety" (緊張) and "Out of This World" (驚世感覺), as well as another popular ballad "Farewell Love Song" (告別戀曲). ''My Way'', the cover of which featured Kwan in a new crew-cut look that has since become iconic, was one of the most celebrated in 1994, enjoying a high-degree of both commercial and critical success.

With increasing confidence in her musical style, Kwan asked producer Joseph Ip (葉廣權) and eight different sound engineers to rearrange ten of her favourite cantopop songs which she handpicked for a covers album. The result was "[[EX All Time Favourites (album)|'EX' All Time Favourites]]," released in February 1995, which featured covers of classics by [[Anita Mui]], [[Leslie Cheung]] and [[Alan Tam]], reworked and reinterpreted with Kwan's alternative musical influences and trademark, ethereal singing style. The lead single, a cover version of Teresa Teng's "[[Forget Him (Teresa Teng song)|Forget Him]]" rearranged by [[Donald Ashley]], was featured in [[Wong Kar-wai]]'s 1995 arthouse film ''[[Fallen Angels (1995 film)|Fallen Angels]]''. The album sold three times platinum, and was selected in 2000 as one of the Top 20 Defining Chinese Albums of All Time for the book (聽見2000分之100) by a jury of musicians which included [[Anthony Wong (singer)|Anthony Wong]], [[Sandee Chan]], Carl Wong and Lin Wei-Che.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 

In the summer of 1995, Kwan released her third compilation album, "Journey of Life" (世途上　新曲＋精選), containing two new singles, "He Needs You, She Needs You" (他需要你, 她需要你), a [[dreampop]] track which incorporated the traditional Chinese instrument ''[[erhu]]'', and the minor hit, "Are There Real Friends in Life" (人生可有知己), a pop ballad which has since became a fan favourite. 

Riding on the success of a string of platinum-selling albums, Kwan held her first large-scale solo concert series, "The One and Only Shirley Kwan In Concert" (難得有一個關淑怡演唱會), in June 1995 at the [[Hong Kong Coliseum]].

===1996-2000: Hiatus===
After seven years at PolyGram, Kwan's contract came to an end in June 1996. A final PolyGram studio album was initially scheduled for release in the summer, containing three American collaborations ("Infectious" [傳染] and "Elusive Love" [愛難尋] written by Andy Goldmark; and "Mumbling" [自言自語] by Suzanne Fountain) and seven other tracks. However, due to Kwan's departure, PolyGram released the material separately in 1997's compilation "Connection" (心靈相通) and 1998's EP "eZone".

Kwan spent the second half of the 90s mostly away from the public eye, but managed to strike up some significant collaborations with friends and fellow contemporaries [[Tats Lau]] and [[Anthony Wong (singer)|Anthony Wong Yiu Ming]] of the former [[Tat Ming Pair]]. The first of these included "Blessed Mary" (萬福馬利亞), a duet with Wong satirising Hong Kong's materialism released in late 1995. This was followed by the Tats Lau collaboration "Cuddle 28800BPS" (繾綣28800BPS), a song dealing with cyber love, and a cover version of the gender-ambiguous Tat Ming classic "Forget He is She" (忘記他是她) at their request, both in 1996. In 1997, Kwan lent her vocals to the theme song of a radio drama produced by Commercial Radio Hong Kong, "Take Me Out Dancing" (帶我去跳舞) which featured a soprano backing vocal mixed with a thumping dance beat. In 1999, she held a "Music Is Live" concert organized by Commercial Radio.

===2001-2002: BMG period===
After several years of inactivity, Kwan attempted a short comeback in 2001, signing a contract reportedly worth 8-million dollars with BMG Taiwan in a high-profile press conference.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Working with well-known producers such as Anthony Bao (包小松), Jamie Hsueh (薛忠銘), and Benjamin Lin (林明陽), she released one Mandarin album, ''Freezing Flame'' (冷火) in November, to critical acclaim. The album spawned two singles, "Freezing Flame" (冷火) and "Who" (是誰) which featured a mix of string instruments and electronic elements. Although the initial contract was for 4 albums, this came to a halt In 2002, when Kwan had become pregnant and moved to Canada. It was in an interview with ''Mingpao'' in 2013, in which she revealed that BMG had not arranged for any recording sessions for more than a year after she gave birth, and this ultimately led to an early termination.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;http://allaboutskwan.blogspot.ca/2013/01/20130107-2304_10.html&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, she was requested by [[Eason Chan]] to record guest vocals for the track "Lies" (謊言) on his album ''Live for Today''.

===2005-2006: Music Nation period===

In fall 2005, Kwan stepped into the recording studio once again and duet with music veteran [[Alan Tam]] in "Rekindle The Flame" (舊情復熾), a Cantonese remake of the French ballad "J'ai murmure va-t-en". The news of Kwan making a comeback sent excitement through Hong Kong's airwaves, and "Rekindle" took the charts by storm, reaching number 1 on [[TVB]], [[RTHK]] and [[Metro Radio Hong Kong|Metro Radio]].

Two months later, Kwan was signed to a contract with Music Nation Group (大國文化) by the famous producer, Frankie Lee Chun. The first single "About Me" (關於我) saw Kwan reunited with lyrist [[Wyman Wong]] and long-time collaborators Joseph Ip and John Laudon. Supported by extensive airplay, "About Me" steadily climbed to the top of various radio charts, and its limited-release special edition CD sold out within a day.

In early February 2006, the eponymous EP "Shirley Kwan" was released, introducing the second brand new single, "Evolution" (進化論). This coincided with the release of a 3CD-Karaoke plus DVD compilation by [[Universal Music]] (formally [[PolyGram]]), entitled "All About Shirley," which contained side projects and rare tracks dating back to the very beginning of her career in Japan.

To much anticipation, three comeback concerts, "Being Shirley On Stage" (關於我 關淑怡演唱會) were held in late February, at the legendary Hong Kong Coliseum. Performing her biggest hits in reverse chronological order, Kwan garnered positive reviews for the performance, which dominated entertainment headlines for a week.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.suk-e.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=959 Suk-e.forum]&lt;/ref&gt; In the final encore, Kwan famously covered [[Eason Chan]]'s "Today Next Year" (明年今日) to a standing ovation, and a sing-a-long audience of 30, 000.

===2007-2009: Star Entertainment period===

Upon completion of her contract with Music Nation, Kwan released two new songs in February 2007 as an independent artist for songwriter Keith Chan (陳輝陽)'s multimedia musical "12 faces of woman" (十二金釵眾生花) at the 2007 Hong Kong Arts Festival.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hk.artsfestival.org/tc/prog/29/ HK arts festival] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20061106010335/http://www.hk.artsfestival.org/tc/prog/29/ |date=2006-11-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This included the theme song "All Living Flowers" (眾生花), which featured a mix of traditional Chinese and Western string instruments and a duet with [[Lee Heung Kam]], "3000 Years Ago" (三千年後) which won the CASH Golden Sail Music Award for Best Alternative Song. In March, she released the single "Just Once" (只得一次), which was the theme song to a primetime [[TVB]] sitcom series and reached no. 1 on the TVB singles chart.

In June 2007, longtime friend and veteran producer Herman Ho (何哲圖) recruited Shirley to his new company "Star Entertainment Ltd." (星娛樂有限公司), which is financed by Neway Karaoke Box (Neway卡拉OK).

2008 saw the release of two new singles, "Mountain, River" (山水) and (天規), followed by a new concert series, "Unexpected Shirley Kwan in Concert," which was held at the Hong Kong Coliseum on 24–25 April 2008.

On 15 June 2009, Kwan released the long-anticipated studio album, ''Shirley's Era'', which contains all singles released in 2007&amp;ndash;2008 as well as newly recorded material. This marked her first, full-length Cantonese studio album since 1994's All Time Favourites. The album produced the new single, "The Ends of the Earth" (地盡頭) which reached no. 1 on the 903 Commercial Radio charts.

===2010-present: Independent===
In October 2010, Kwan performed a live concert "One Starry Night: An Evening with Shirley Kwan" at the Venetian Arena in Macau, which featured mostly live covers of songs by other artists, such as Alan Tam's "Illusion" (幻影), Aaron Kwok's "Why did I let you go?" (我為何讓你走) and Faye Wong's "I'm Willing" (我願意). She returned to the same stage on 12 November 2011 with long-time friend and collaborator Anthony Wong for the concert, "Anthony Wong x Shirley Kwan: Forget He is She Concert, Macau 2011." 

In 2012, Kwan collaborated with [[Juno Mak]] on the single "Clavicle" (鎖骨), which offers a mature example of her dream pop vocals and reached no. 1 on the Commercial Radio charts. In late 2012, she released the limited edition single, "Tourbillon" (陀飛輪), a cover of an Eason Chan song to polarizing reviews, but which was lauded by both the lyricist Wyman Wong and Anthony Wong for her authorial style.&lt;ref&gt;http://news.stheadline.com/dailynews/headline_news_detail_columnist.asp?id=216245&amp;section_name=wtt&amp;kw=149&lt;/ref&gt;

On 02 February 2013, she held her 4th concert series at the Hong Kong Coliseum, "Philip Stein Your Favorite Shirley Kwan Suk'E In Concert," for two consecutive evenings. Later that year, she took part in a series of concerts, "Polygram Forever" for the newly revived label and recorded the theme song, "Coincidence" (實屬巧合) for the TVB series ''Always and Ever'' (情逆三世緣). 

In 2014, she recorded a duet with [[Mag Lam]] (星斗群) as the theme song to the TVB series ''Never Dance Alone'' (女人俱樂部).

In 2016, Kwan held a concert celebrating her 25th anniversary in the music industry, "The Best of Shirley Kwan 25 Live," at the Hong Kong Coliseum to rave reviews. Kwan dedicated the performance to her late mother, and broke down during her performance of the Hins Cheung cover, "Stay Young Forever" (青春常註), prompting a memorable audience sing-along.

On 9 April 2017, she performed as a musical guest at the 36th Hong Kong Film awards amidst controversy of her recent arrest for intimidation and common assault. She performed a medley of theme songs including "Invincible" (無敵) and "Let Me Stay by Your Side" (讓我留在你身邊) backed by [[Hanjin Tan]], [[Supper Moment]] and The Interzone Collective, as well as presented the awards for Best Original Film Song and Best Original Score.

==Filmography==
In early 1997, Kwan was asked by Hong Kong filmmaker [[Wong Kar-wai]] to star in his film ''[[Happy Together (1997 film)|Happy Together]]''. She was flown to Argentina in five days' notice and ended up spending more than two months filming. Starring opposite [[Tony Leung Chiu Wai|Tony Leung Chiu-Wai]] and [[Chang Chen]], Kwan played Leung's mysterious and lonely secret admirer and also recorded a cover of [[Caetano Veloso]]'s "Cucurucucu Paloma" (Song of Dove) for the film's soundtrack. However, her scenes were all deleted from the final version of the film, for which Wong later went on to win Best Director at the [[Cannes Film Festival|Cannes]]. It took another three years for Kwan's scenes to surface, when they were included in the making-of documentary, ''Buenos Aires Zero Degrees'' (布宜諾斯艾利斯之攝氏零度). The documentary premiered at the 2000 [[Berlin International Film Festival]] out of competition, and was also shown at the 2000 [[Golden Horse Film Festival and Awards]] in Taiwan.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.filmfestivals.com/berlin_2000/parallel/_forum_film_buenos.htm Film festivals.com berlin 2000] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071113054421/http://www.filmfestivals.com/berlin_2000/parallel/_forum_film_buenos.htm |date=2007-11-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Kwan is a single mother and gave birth to her son in January 2002 in Canada. Despite rumors involving [[Eric Tsang]] as the father, Kwan has never disclosed the true paternity of her child and insists only that they had met in Canada, and is not someone in the entertainment business. Kwan seems to have broken her silence in 2014 when she posted a photo of Zuri Rinpoche 8th on her instagram, with a caption claiming him to be the true father of her child. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.hk01.com/%E5%A8%9B%E6%A8%82/50446/%E9%97%9C%E6%B7%91%E6%80%A1%E6%83%85%E8%B7%AF%E5%9D%8E%E5%9D%B7-%E5%85%92%E5%AD%90%E7%94%9F%E7%88%B6%E7%96%91%E4%BC%BC%E4%B8%8D%E4%B8%B9%E5%AF%A7%E6%B3%A2%E8%BB%8A|title=關淑怡情路坎坷　兒子生父疑似不丹寧波車｜香港01｜娛樂｜|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In the past, Kwan has been romantically linked to [[Michael Chow (actor) |Michael Chow]] (1992-96), and Hacken Lee. 

===Controversies===
In September 2012, Kwan posted a suicidal message on facebook. She was incommunicado for roughly thirty-six hours before contacting her younger sister to confirm her safety.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jaynestars.com/news/shirley-kwan-calls-sister-after-missing-for-36-hours/|title=Shirley Kwan Calls Sister After Missing for 36 Hours|date=2012-09-11|website=Jaynestars|accessdate=2015-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2016, Kwan was rescued from the waters off Discovery Bay. She was walking along the shore with a female friend, who had reportedly told officers that she was unhappy from work and had walked down to the sea for a swim. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/law-crime/article/2039887/canto-pop-veteran-shirley-kwan-rescued-waters-discovery-bay|title=Canto-pop veteran Shirley Kwan rescued in waters off Discovery Bay {{!}} South China Morning Post|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In May 2017, Kwan was charged with one count of intimidation and one count of common assault for an altercation that took place with a hotel staff earlier in March.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/law-crime/article/2094175/hong-kong-pop-star-shirley-kwan-charged-assault-and|title=Hong Kong pop star Shirley Kwan charged with assault and intimidation of hotel staff {{!}} South China Morning Post|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Shukria Tabassum''' ([[Dari language|Dari]]: {{small|{{nq|شکریه تبستم}}}}) was the daughter of Ramazan Ali from [[Afghanistan]] born in [[Jaghori]] district of [[Ghazni Province]].&lt;ref name="hazarapeople"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hazarapeople.com/2015/11/15/shukria-tabassum/|title=Shukria Tabassum &amp;#124; Hazara People International Network|publisher=hazarapeople.com|accessdate=2016-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She belonged to the [[Hazara ethnic group]] of Afghanistan. She used to go to school. At the age of 9 she was kidnapped by [[ISIS]] in Afghanistan. During a journey from Jaghori to [[Quetta]], [[Pakistan]] all 7 ethnic Hazara passengers were captured in the valley of [[Zabul]], Afghanistan.&lt;ref name="gapbagap"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://af.gapbagap.com/?p=2003#|title=شهید شکریه Shaheed Shukria &amp;#8211; Tabassum &amp;#8211; گپ به گپ|publisher=af.gapbagap.com|accessdate=2016-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After beheading all 7 kidnap victims, around 1000,000 demonstrators gathered in Kabul to protest against government policies and the administration.&lt;ref name="catholic"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.catholic.org/news/international/middle_east/story.php?id=65311|title=Afghanis protest ISIS beheading of 9-year-old girl - Middle East - International - News - Catholic Online|author=Catholic Online|publisher=catholic.org|accessdate=2016-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

}}
'''Stephan Bibrowski''' (1890–1932), better known as '''Lionel the Lion-faced Man''', was a famous [[sideshow]] [[performer]]. His whole body was covered with long hair that gave him the appearance of a [[lion]]; this was likely due to a rare condition called [[hypertrichosis]].

Bibrowski was born in 1890 in Bielsk near [[Płock]] in [[Congress Poland]] with one-inch hair covering his body. His mother (Benedict) blamed the condition on the mauling of his father (Michael) by a lion, which she [[Maternal impression|witnessed while pregnant]] with Stephan. She considered Stephan an abomination and gave him up to a [[Germany|German]] impresario named Sedlmayer when he was four years old. Sedlmayer gave him his stage name and started exhibiting him around Europe.&lt;ref name="Freakshows"&gt;[http://www.spiegel.de/einestages/phaenomen-freakshows-a-947387.html Phänomen  Freakshows]&lt;/ref&gt;

By the time he was put on exhibit, Lionel's hair had grown to eight inches (twenty centimetres) on his face and hung about four inches (ten centimetres) everywhere else. His body was almost entirely covered with hair, the only exceptions being the palms of his hands and the soles of his feet. In 1901, Lionel traveled to the [[United States]] and started appearing with the [[Barnum and Bailey]] Circus. He toured with the circus from then on, occasionally going back to Europe.

In his act, Lionel performed [[gymnastic]] tricks, and also spoke to people to show his gentle side that sharply contrasted with his appearance. He settled in the U.S. in 1920, becoming a popular attraction, and moved to [[New York City]], where he was a fixture at [[Coney Island]].

By the late 1920s, Lionel retired from his sideshow career and moved back to Germany. He was reported to have died in [[Berlin]] from a heart attack in 1932 at forty-one years old.&lt;ref name="Freakshows"/&gt;

In addition, she features in video clips and the Dutch TV-series ''{{Interlanguage link multi|Costa! (TV series)|nl|3=Costa! (televisieserie)|lt=Costa|vertical-align=sup}}''. She also introduced the ''Pure by Sylvie'' jewellery line to the Dutch market. Thereafter, she hosted the 2008 [[FIFA World Player of the Year]] award ceremony.

After being elected the Netherlands' Sexiest Female in 2003,&lt;ref name="Jurymitglied"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rtl.de/cms/sendungen/das-supertalent/news/jurymitglied-sylvie-van-der-vaart-4041-6391-22-94895.html |title= Jurymitglied Sylvie van der Vaart  |date= 6 September 2011 |month= |year= |work= |publisher= rtl.de |location= |page= |pages= |at= |arxiv= |asin= |bibcode= |doi= |doi-broken= |isbn= |issn= |jfm= |jstor= |lccn= |mr= |oclc= |ol= |osti= |pmc = |pmid= |rfc= |ssrn= |zbl= |id= |accessdate= |quote= |ref= |separator= |postscript=}}&lt;/ref&gt; she started a relationship with then [[AFC Ajax|Ajax]] footballer [[Rafael van der Vaart]]. Due in part to the fame from their individual careers, they soon became the Netherlands' most famous "football couple". Their fame grew after their marriage on 10 June 2005 and live coverage of the wedding on SBS6, a Dutch television channel, with the broadcast gaining high ratings in the Netherlands; Sylvie took Rafael's last name, van der Vaart.

=== Germany ===
Meis and her then husband moved to Germany when he left Ajax to play for [[Bundesliga]] football club [[Hamburger SV]]. After her husband's 2008 transfer to [[Real Madrid C.F.|Real Madrid]], the van der Vaarts moved to Spain. Between 2008 and 2011, she was a judge on ''[[Das Supertalent]]'', the German version of Simon Cowell's ''[[Got Talent]]'' series. In 2010 she took part in the third season of the German equivalent of [[Strictly Come Dancing]], called ''[[Let's Dance (German TV series)|Let's Dance]]''. On 17 April 2010, Meis replaced the usual ''[[Deutschland sucht den Superstar]]'' judge [[Nina Eichinger]] for the final of the [[Deutschland sucht den Superstar (Season 7)|7th season]], after the latter was stuck in [[Los Angeles]] following flight restrictions as a result of the [[2010 eruptions of Eyjafjallajökull]].&lt;ref name="Bunte"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bunte.de/stars/sylvie-van-der-vaart-sie-ersetzt-nina-eichinger-bei-dsds_aid_16527.html|title=Sylvie van der Vaart wird heute DSDS-Jurorin Nina Eichinger ersetzen|work=[[Bunte]]|date=17 April 2010|accessdate=17 April 2010|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Welt"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.welt.de/vermischtes/article7225894/Vom-Vulkan-Ausbruch-zum-Verkehrs-Chaos.html|title=Asche über Europa: Vom Vulkan-Ausbruch zum Verkehrs-Chaos|work=[[Die Welt]]|date=17 April 2010|accessdate=17 April 2010|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt; Between 2011 and 2017 Meis has been hosting the show ''Let's Dance'' together with [[Daniel Hartwich]]. In 2018 she was replaced by former participant [[Viktoria Swarovski]] and instead returned to ''Das Supertalent'' as a judge.
&lt;ref name="RTL 13.03.12" /&gt;

Following in the footsteps of famous entertainers such as [[Johannes Heesters]] and [[Rudi Carell]], Meis is one of the most successful Dutch personalities active in Germany.&lt;ref name="Movienews"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.movienewz.nl/rudicarrell/?sub=extern&amp;waid=36728|title=Nederlanderse-entertainer-sin-Duitsland|work=[[Die Welt]]|date=17 April 2010|accessdate=7 April 2011|language=Dutch|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120425191738/http://www.movienewz.nl/rudicarrell/?sub=extern|archivedate=25 April 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Personal life ==
Meis is of partly [[Indo people|Indo-European]] descent, her father being Dutch-Indonesian, her mother being [[Belgian people|Belgian]].&lt;ref&gt;{{nl icon}} Sylvie is quoted saying: ''"Ik heb namelijk Indisch bloed."'' in Dutch newspaper article ([[Telegraaf]]). See transcript in her online wedding book: {{cite web |url=http://www.bruidsbubbels.nl/Sylvie__Rafael/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-07-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120425152505/http://www.bruidsbubbels.nl/Sylvie__Rafael/ |archivedate=25 April 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{nl icon}} [http://www.vijfeeuwenmigratie.nl/indische-vrouwen-nederlandse-culturele-leven Article: 'Indo women in Dutch cultural life.' on Dutch Migration website.] Retrieved 14 July 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{nl icon}} [http://indisch4ever.web-log.nl/indisch4ever/2005/11/sylvie_van_der_.html  News article on Dutch Indo website.] Retrieved 14 July 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

Meis was in a relationship with footballer [[Rafael van der Vaart]] from 2003. On 10 June 2005, Sylvie married Rafael and on 28 May 2006, their son Damián Rafael was born. Some of the media described the couple as the "new Beckhams" but both of them denied the claims saying that they prefer to just live a normal life.&lt;ref&gt;[http://vandervaartofficial.com/en/fobazo_exclusives.asp?AjrPage=5&amp;AjrDcmntId=6040&amp;bandw=high Sylvie and Rafael]{{Dead link|date=June 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=no }} Van der Vaart Official&lt;/ref&gt;

On 16 June 2009, she announced that she had been diagnosed with [[breast cancer]], and had undergone surgery in May 2009. She finished post-op [[chemotherapy]] and is cancer free. In the summer of 2009, [[Real Madrid]] wanted to sell Rafael van der Vaart, but the player decided to stay in Madrid because Sylvie was undergoing cancer treatments there.&lt;ref name="fourfourtwo1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://au.fourfourtwo.com/news/182316,wifes-cancer-kept-van-der-vaart-in-madrid.aspx |title=Wife's Cancer Kept Van Der Vaart In Madrid |publisher=Australian FourFourTwo |date=4 September 2010 |accessdate=18 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; A year later, upon his move to England, Rafael stated ''"She had a very serious illness and it is true that she had to be treated at the Clínica Quirón. Last season, they wanted me to leave but I couldn't leave for that reason. Now she is well and the only thing that happened was that Madrid wanted to sell and I wanted to get back to enjoying playing football, and Tottenham are a great team that are going to give me the football opportunities that I need."''&lt;ref name="fourfourtwo1"/&gt;

In 2010, Sylvie admitted to having [[adultery|cheated on]] her husband, stating that Van der Vaart found out through emails that she was having an affair with a [[KLM]] airline pilot which she believed was the beginning of the end of their marriage. On 2 January 2013, Sylvie acknowledged their separation&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stern.de/lifestyle/leute/rafael-und-sylvie-van-der-vaart-ehe-kaputt-schlaege-in-der-silvesternacht-1948845.html|title=Ehe kaputt - Schläge in der Silvesternacht|work=[[Stern (magazine)|Stern]]|date=2 January 2013|accessdate=2 January 2013|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt; after he had struck her in front of their guests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thehimalayantimes.com/fullNews.php?headline=Marriage+crumbles+after+Rafael+hits+Sylvie+van+der+Vaart&amp;NewsID=360291 |title=Marriage crumbles after Rafael hits Sylvie van der Vaart |first= |last= |author= |authorlink= |date= 3 January 2013 |month= |year= |work= |publisher= [[The Himalayan Times]]|location= |page= |pages= |at= |language= |trans-title=|format= |arxiv= |asin= |bibcode= |doi= |doi-broken= |isbn= |issn= |jfm= |jstor= |lccn= |mr= |oclc= |ol= |osti= |pmc = |pmid= |rfc= |ssrn= |zbl= |id= |accessdate=2015-01-10 |quote= "But Holland's answer to Posh and Becks then announced that their seven year marriage was over" |ref= |separator= |postscript=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their divorce was finalized in December 2013.

'''Terence Turner''' is a [[Character (arts)|fictional character]] from the [[Television in the United Kingdom|British]] [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] [[soap opera]], ''[[Emmerdale]]''. He was played first by Stephen Marchant and then by [[Nick Brimble]] until the character's death in 2006.

==Storylines==

===1985===
He first appeared in 1985 when he was a student at Oxford University and had a brief romance with [[Sandie Merrick]].

It was stated in the show that the character was 20 years old in 1984, meaning he was born in 1964.

===2006===
When Terence returned to the village in 2006, attempting to con his father out of £20,000, his age had been substantially altered and his birth year was stated as being 1951. Terence's sister, [[Steph Stokes|Steph]], revealed that he [[child molestation|sexually abused]] her when they were teenagers. Alan refused to believe Steph, thinking she was trying to cause trouble because she was jealous. He moved into Holdgate Farm with Terence and one night Terence got really drunk and admitted that Steph was telling the truth. Alan and Terence had a fight and Alan lost. Terence took Alan's money and escaped, while Steph and her husband [[Adam Forsythe]] found Alan.

Terence was away for a while but returned after Adam started receiving weird phonecalls. Terence told Adam he had delved into his past and found out he had hit a young boy, losing his doctor's license. It was revealed Adam was practising illegally using his late father's registration. Terence demanded £50,000 from Adam in exchange for not going to the police. Adam got the money and Terence came to collect it from the B&amp;B, but wanted more. Adam offered him drugs to sell but Adam took some ether and stunned Terence. He then dragged Terence to the basement and went back up. Then Steph came home, worrying about Adam because he hadn't called her. Terence woke up, while Adam and Steph were in the house. Terence fought with Adam and Steph and Adam bludgeoned Terence over the head and killed him. Adam and Steph buried Terence in the woods and tried to make sure that no one knew about it. However, Steph was uncomfortable about lying about Terence's disappearance so Adam started drugging her to keep her quiet and she was later sectioned as it was suspected that she was having a nervous breakdown. Eventually the truth came out when Steph admitted it in court, leading to her and Adam being arrested for Terence's murder.

After graduation, Tomaszewska-Bończa studied briefly at the [[Polish Naval Academy]] and then between 1952 and 1953 she taught at a vocational school in [[Gdynia]].{{sfn|Rymar|2009}} In 1953, Tomaszewska-Bończa married {{Interlanguage link multi|Władysław Klimek|pl|3=Władysław Klimek (pedagog)}}, moved to [[Gorzów Wielkopolski]] and taught at the Gastronomic Technical College ({{lang-pl|Technikum Gastronomicznym}}) for two years. In 1957, she began teaching at the Chemical Technical College ({{lang-pl|Technikum Chemicznym}}), where she remained until 1972. She completed a master's degree UAM in 1966 and in 1976 completed her post-graduate studies in computer science at the [[University of Warsaw]]. Between 1972 and 1984 she taught mathematics at the {{Interlanguage link multi|Maria Sklodowska-Curie High School of Gorzów Wielkopolski|pl|3=II Liceum Ogólnokształcące im. Marii Skłodowskiej-Curie w Gorzowie Wielkopolskim|lt=Maria Sklodowska-Curie High School}} in Gorzów Wielkopolski. During this time frame, she also worked on an experimental project between 1976 and 1980 launched in high schools by the Science Ministry. Klimek retired from teaching in 1984.{{sfn|''Echo Gorzowa''|2013}}

In the 1970s, Klimek helped organize the [[Klub Inteligencji Katolickiej|Catholic Intellectuals Club]] ({{lang-pl|Klub Inteligencji Katolickiej (KIK)}}), which she and her husband Władysław had founded.{{sfn|''Echo Gorzowa''|2013}} KIK's purpose was to stimulate independent thought and bring Catholics within Poland information about Catholic philosophy from countries outside the [[Eastern Bloc|Socialist Bloc]].{{sfn|''Magiczny Kraków''|2013}} Though it had to operate illegally and could not be registered until 1981, the group challenged authorities and openly promoted the organization.{{sfn|''Echo Gorzowa''|2013}} Beginning in 1980, Klimek was also engaged in the business of [[Solidarity (Polish trade union)|the Polish Trade Union, "Solidarity"]] ({{lang-pl|Niezależny Samorządny Związek Zawodowy (NSZZ)}}).{{sfn|''Catholic Information Agency''|2013}} Solidarity's goals were to bring about socio-economic reforms by changing the political system.{{sfn|Paczkowski|2010|p=420}} Klimek promoted the organization in schools, encouraging students to found an independent student organization.{{sfn|Institute of National Remembrance|2016}} She served on the regional board and was a delegate to the provincial congress as a Solidarity delegate.{{sfn|''Catholic Information Agency''|2013}}

From 1980 to 1981 Klimek served on an assistance committee for prisoners of conscience and provided care for members who were imprisoned. She was interned between 15 December 1981 and 27 June 1982 in camps in [[Poznan]] and [[Gołdap]],{{sfn|Institute of National Remembrance|2016}} during the implementation of [[martial law in Poland]]. Martial law was imposed to frighten people and make them think that [[Communism in Poland|Polish Communism]] was strong and could not be overthrown.{{sfn|Penn|2006|p=228}} After her release, Klimek worked in the Catholic Underground in support of Solidarity.{{sfn|''Catholic Information Agency''|2013}} Crucial to the underground's success was the underground press{{sfn|Paczkowski|2010|p=462}} and in Gorzów Wielkopolski, Klimek's husband Władysław edited several journals and wrote articles for Solidarity.{{sfn|Pytlak|2016}}

Under the pseudonym "Simeon and Agnik", in 1983 Klimek wrote the activist's song "Feniksa" ([[Phoenix (mythology)|Phoenix]]).{{sfn|Rymar|2009}} In 1986, Klimek was involved in the reactivation of Solidarity and became a member of the Regional Executive Committee for the union.{{sfn|Institute of National Remembrance|2016}} Klimek initiated the Gorzów Committee for the Memory of the [[Katyn massacre|Victims of Katyn]] and was made an honorary member of Gorzów's Katyn Families.{{sfn|''Catholic Information Agency''|2013}}

==Death and legacy==
Klimek died on 29 December 2013 in Gorzów Wielkopolski.{{sfn|''Echo Gorzowa''|2013}} Both during her lifetime, and posthumously, Klimek was decorated for her activism and excellence as an educator. She was recipient of the Merit Award for Gorzowski Region (1998); Gold Badge of the National Section of Education NSZZ "S" (2005); [[Pro Memoria Medal]] (2005); Knight's Cross of the [[Order of Polonia Restituta]] (2009); Merit for the Lubuskie Province (2009); Merit Award for the City of Gorzow (2010), Silver Medal of the {{Interlanguage link multi|Medal of Guardian Places of National Remembrance|pl|3=Medal Opiekuna Miejsc Pamięci Narodowej}} (2010), Award of the Region Gorzowski NSZZ "S" (2010), {{Interlanguage link multi|Honorary Citizen of Gorzów Wielkopolski|pl|3=Honorowi Obywatele Miasta Gorzowa Wielkopolskiego}} (2013);{{sfn|Rymar|2009}} and [[Cross of Freedom and Solidarity]] (2015){{sfn|Szczepanowski|2015}}

'''Thomas Danforth ''' (baptized November 20, 1623 – November 5, 1699) was a politician, magistrate, and landowner in the [[Massachusetts Bay Colony]].  A conservative [[Puritan]], he served for many years as one of the colony's councilors and magistrates, generally leading opposition to attempts by the English kings to assert control over the colony.  He accumulated land in the central part of the colony that eventually became a portion of [[Framingham, Massachusetts]].  His government roles included administration of territory in present-day [[Maine]] that was purchased by the colony.

Danforth was a magistrate and leading figure in the colony at the time of the [[Salem witch trials]], but did not sit on the [[Court of Oyer and Terminer]].  Despite this, he is inaccurately depicted in [[Arthur Miller]]'s play ''[[The Crucible]]'' and its movie adaptations as doing so. He is presented as a harsh and domineering governor, apparently conflated with [[William Stoughton (Massachusetts)|William Stoughton]], who does not appear in Miller's play (although he and [[Samuel Sewall]] are mentioned briefly by Danforth in Act 3, Scene 1). In reality, Danforth is recorded as being critical of the conduct of the trials, and played a role in bringing them to an end.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}

==Early life==
Thomas Danforth was born in [[Framlingham]], [[Suffolk]], England, and baptized on November 20, 1623.&lt;ref name=May18&gt;May, p. 18&lt;/ref&gt;  He was the eldest son of Nicholas Danforth (1589–1638) and Elizabeth Symmes (1596–1629).&lt;ref name=PS30&gt;Parr and Swope, p. 30&lt;/ref&gt; Danforth immigrated with his father, brothers [[Samuel Danforth|Samuel]] and Jonathan, and sisters Anna, Elizabeth, and Lydia to [[New England]] in 1634, probably aboard the ''[[Griffin (ship)|Griffin]]''.&lt;ref&gt;May, p. vii&lt;/ref&gt; The family, along with the 200 or so other passengers aboard, left England to escape persecution for their [[Puritan]] beliefs. [[William Laud]] had become archbishop of the [[Church of England]] in 1633 and begun a crackdown on [[Nonconformism|Nonconformist]] religious practices (such as those practiced by the more [[Calvinist]] Puritans) that prompted a [[Puritan migration to New England (1620–1640)|wave of migration]] to the New World.&lt;ref&gt;Labaree, pp. 17–19&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;May, pp. x–xi&lt;/ref&gt;

==Public service==
[[Image:HarvardCollegeCharter.jpeg|thumb|left|The original charter of [[Harvard College]]]]
Soon after his arrival in the [[Massachusetts Bay Colony]] Nicholas Danforth acquired property in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts|Cambridge]], becoming one of the town's leading citizens and a member of the colony's general court (as its assembly was known).  He died in 1638, leaving his lands and the care of his younger children to Thomas.  In 1643 Danforth was admitted a [[freeman (Colonial)|freeman]] of the colony, which conferred on him the right to vote and to participate in the colony's political affairs.&lt;ref name=PS30/&gt;

He was appointed [[Treasurer]] of [[Harvard College]] in its charter of 1650, and served as a steward of the college from 1669 to 1682.&lt;ref name=May18/&gt; From 1659 he sat on the colony's council of assistants, and was elected deputy governor in 1679.&lt;ref name=PS30/&gt;  In 1665 Danforth was member of a commission that oversaw the extension of Massachusetts colonial authority over the territories of what is now southern [[Maine]],&lt;ref&gt;Martin, p. 16&lt;/ref&gt; which colonial surveyors had determined to fall within its borders.&lt;ref&gt;Mayo, pp. 225–226&lt;/ref&gt;

Danforth's politics and religion were relatively conservative, with one historian describing him as "the [[John Pym|Pym]] of Massachusetts politics".&lt;ref name=Doyle134&gt;Doyle, p. 134&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1661 the colony was rebuked by [[Charles II of England|King Charles II]] for its mistreatment of [[Quakers]]; the colonial government had banned Quakers from its territory under threat of death, and [[Boston martyrs|four of them]] had recently been hanged after repeatedly violating the ban.  The king in his letter demanded that the colony allow Quakers and others freedom of religious expression.&lt;ref&gt;Doyle, pp. 108–109, 134&lt;/ref&gt;  Danforth was one member of a committee that was established to formulate a response.  The document the committee drafted was a conservative declaration that the colonial government was essentially sovereign except where its laws conflicted with English law.  (By the time the king's letter arrived the colonial government had already lessened the harsh punishments for violating bans.)&lt;ref&gt;Doyle, pp. 134–135&lt;/ref&gt;  Two committee members, magistrate [[Simon Bradstreet]] and minister [[John Norton (Puritan divine)|John Norton]], were sent to England to argue the colony's case.&lt;ref&gt;Doyle, p. 136&lt;/ref&gt;

When [[King Philip's War]] broke out in 1675 (pitting many Native American tribes of southern New England against English colonists), Danforth was involved in some of the events of the war.  Many colonists distrusted the [[Praying Indian]]s (Christianized Indians living peacefully in communities on the outskirts of English towns), some of whom were attacked by mobs of English settlers seeking revenge for attacks on their communities.  Danforth, along with [[Daniel Gookin]] and the Indian missionary Reverend [[John Eliot (missionary)|John Eliot]], was a vocal supporter of the Praying Indians, and worked to prevent some of these excesses, at some personal risk.&lt;ref&gt;Pulsipher, pp. 147–149&lt;/ref&gt;  In one notable instance Danforth was aboard a small boat with other colonial officials in [[Boston Harbor]] en route to [[Long Island (Massachusetts)|Long Island]] to inspect facilities for Praying Indians who had been relocated their "for their own safety" when a nearby ship apparently intentionally rammed the smaller vessel.  No one was injured in the incident, but all of the older officials were dunked in the cold waters of the harbor.&lt;ref&gt;Pulsipher, pp. 147, 154–155&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1680 Danforth was chosen president in the District of Maine by the Massachusetts assembly.  The colony had previously governed this territory (roughly the land between the [[Piscataqua River|Piscataqua]] and [[Kennebec River|Kennebec]] Rivers in what is now southwestern Maine), but its right to do so had been stripped by King Charles after protests by the heirs of Sir [[Ferdinando Gorges]], who had long-standing claims to the area.  Agents for Massachusetts then purchased the territory from the Gorges heirs, and Danforth was appointed to administer it.&lt;ref&gt;''York Deeds'', p. 9&lt;/ref&gt;  The territory had been devastated and many properties abandoned during King Philip's War, and Danforth acted in effect as a [[Lord Proprietor]], making land grants and reestablishing towns such as [[Falmouth, Maine|Falmouth]] and [[North Yarmouth, Maine|North Yarmouth]].  Danforth was rewarded by the colony with a grant of an island in [[Casco Bay]] for this work, which he oversaw until 1686.&lt;ref&gt;Martin, p. 17&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout the 1670s the Massachusetts leadership steadfastly refused to make changes to its administration that were demanded by King Charles.&lt;ref&gt;Adams (2001), pp. 377–386&lt;/ref&gt;  At the instigation of agent [[Edward Randolph (colonial administrator)|Edward Randolph]], Charles made increasingly specific demands concerning freedom of religion and adherence to colonial trade regulations known as the [[Navigation Acts]], and prepared to issue a ''[[quo warranto]]'' writ to demand the return of the colonial charter.  Danforth was one of the leading opponents to making any accommodation to the king's demands.&lt;ref&gt;Adams (2001), pp. 391–394&lt;/ref&gt;  The issue reached a peak in the 1684 election, in which Danforth stood for election as governor representing the hardline party.  He was narrowly defeated by the more conciliatory Simon Bradstreet, but retained the post of deputy governor.&lt;ref&gt;Doyle, p. 222&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Harris316/&gt;  The colony's attempts at moderation were in vain&amp;mdash;the charter was formally annulled on June 18, 1684.&lt;ref&gt;Adams (1886), p. 212&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1686 King [[James II of England|James II]] established the [[Dominion of New England]] as a new colonial entity to govern all of [[New England]].  He appointed Massachusetts native [[Joseph Dudley]] as its first governor; he was replaced later that year by Sir [[Edmund Andros]].  Both Dudley and Andros excluded Danforth from their councils, given his opposition to crown authority.  The dominion reign, which did not include an elected assembly, was extremely unpopular in Massachusetts for a variety of reasons.  When the [[Glorious Revolution]] deposed James, Massachusetts Puritan leaders orchestrated [[1689 Boston revolt|an uprising]] and arrested Andros, Dudley, and other dominion officials.  In the period between the dominion's collapse and the establishment of the [[Province of Massachusetts Bay]] in 1692, the old colonial government was temporarily reestablished, and Danforth resumed his offices.&lt;ref name=Harris316&gt;Harris, p. 316&lt;/ref&gt;

===Salem trials===
{{main|Salem witch trials}}
In 1692, Danforth was acting governor during the early months of the witch hysteria in [[Salem, Massachusetts|Salem]] and his name appears once in the Salem court records as part of a council which observed the proceedings on April 11.&lt;ref&gt;Woodward, ''Records of Salem Witchcraft'', Copied from the Original Documents, 1864&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=July 2014}}&lt;ref&gt;[https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Rn0PAAAAYAAJ Salem Records]&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=July 2014}}{{full|date=July 2014}} but his involvement ended in May upon the arrival of Sir [[William Phips]], the first royal governor under the new charter of the [[Province of Massachusetts Bay]].&lt;ref&gt;Burr, George Lincoln {{Google books|Rm2VLpGmhqQC|Narratives of the Witchcraft Cases, 1648-1706}}&lt;!-- Introduction to Phips Letters --&gt; &lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=July 2014}} Danforth was not assigned to the special [[Court of Oyer and Terminer]] that Phips established shortly thereafter, and he was opposed to the manner in which magistrate [[William Stoughton (Massachusetts)|William Stoughton]] conducted the witch trials, which unconditionally accepted [[spectral evidence]] in its proceedings, and vigorously presumed the guilt of the accused. In a letter by Thomas Brattle in October 8, 1692, Danforth is described as among a select group of "several about the Bay, men for understanding, judgement and piety... that do utterly condemn the said proceedings, and do freely deliver their judgment..." &lt;ref&gt;Burr, George Lincoln {{Google books|Rm2VLpGmhqQC|Narratives of the Witchcraft Cases, 1648-1706|page=184}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the Court of Oyer and Terminer stopped sitting, a new [[Massachusetts Superior Court of Judicature|Superior Court]] was created, and, in December 1692, Stoughton was elected by the governor's council to head the court, defeating Danforth by three votes. In early 1693, Danforth sat on Superior Court sessions conducted by Stoughton that continued to hear witchcraft cases, but without accepting spectral evidence. By this time the hysteria was dying down, and the court (sometimes with Danforth leading after Stoughton temporarily removed himself in protest at the ban on spectral evidence and other reforms imposed by Governor Phips. Danforth was sympathetic to the plight of individuals accused, relocating some of them to his lands west of Boston; Salem End Road in Framingham is part of the area where they settled.&lt;ref&gt;Parr and Swope, p. 38&lt;/ref&gt;

==Family and property==
Danforth married Mary Withington in 1644.&lt;ref name=PS30/&gt; The couple had 12 children, but half of these died before the age of three. Danforth was survived by only three of the others.&lt;ref&gt;May, pp. 19–23&lt;/ref&gt;  Danforth died in Cambridge on November 5, 1699.&lt;ref name=Appletons&gt;{{Cite Appletons'|title=Danforth, Thomas|year=1888|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=P68LAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA73#v=onepage&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Framinghamseal.png|thumb|right|upright|The seal of [[Framingham, Massachusetts]]; the words "Danforth's Farm" are visible near the top of the shield.]]
In 1662 Danforth began to acquire land to the west of Boston by way of land grants by the [[Massachusetts General Court|Great and General Court]] after general surveys conducted by [[Edmund Rice (1638)|Edmund Rice]] at the behest of the Court.&lt;ref&gt;p.92 In: Temple, J.H. (1887). ''History of Framingham, Massachusetts, Early Known as Danforth's Farms 1640-1880''.

==Fictional character in ''The Crucible''==
In [[Arthur Miller]]'s play ''[[The Crucible]],'' Danforth is depicted as the leading judicial figure overseeing the Salem trials.  William Stoughton is not a character in the play, and Miller portrays Danforth as an honest but domineering and selfish judge, under whose authority many are imprisoned and sentenced to hang.&lt;ref&gt;Bloom, p. 72&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Abbotson, p. 119&lt;/ref&gt; When [[John Proctor (convicted witch)|John Proctor]], an accused, defies his authority at the end of the play by refusing to lie and sign a public confession saying that he is a witch and accusing others, he is mercilessly sentenced to hang.&lt;ref&gt;Bloom, p. 60&lt;/ref&gt; In an introduction to the play, Miller wrote that he had combined several persons and made other changes to the historical characters for dramatic purposes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Miller|first=Arthur|title=The Crucible|url=http://asbamericanlit.edublogs.org/files/2011/10/21078735-The-Crucible-Arthur-Miller-2hmdzot.pdf|work=Cynthia Sinsap's American Literature blog}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Miller also wrote the screenplay for the [[The Crucible (1996 film)|1996 film version]] of the play, in which the name Danforth was retained (portrayed by actor [[Paul Scofield]]) as the principal judicial antagonist.&lt;ref&gt;Abbotson, pp. 127–128&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[The Crucible (1957 film)|1957 film adaptation of the play]], whose screenplay was written by [[Jean-Paul Sartre]], Danforth (portrayed by [[Raymond Rouleau]], who also directed the picture) is portrayed the same way.&lt;ref&gt;Bloom, pp. 65, 191–93&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Tiresias striking the snakes.png|thumb|300px|right|Tiresias strikes two snakes with a stick, and is transformed into a woman by Hera. Engraving by [[Johann Ulrich Kraus]] c. 1690. Taken from ''Die Verwandlungen des Ovidii'' (The Metamorphoses of Ovid).]]
In [[Greek mythology]], '''Tiresias''' ({{IPAc-en|t|aɪ|ˈ|r|iː|s|i|ə|s}}; {{lang-grc-gre|[[wikt:Τειρεσίας|Τειρεσίας]]}}, ''Teiresias'') was a blind [[prophet]] of [[Apollo]] in [[Thebes, Greece|Thebes]], famous for [[clairvoyance]] and for being transformed into a woman for seven years. He was the son of the shepherd {{ill|Everes|el|Ευήρης}} and the [[nymph]] [[Chariclo]].&lt;ref&gt;Of a line born of the dragon's teeth sown by [[Cadmus]] (''[[Bibliotheke]]'', III.6.7); see also Hyginus, ''[[Fabulae|Fabula]]'' 75.&lt;/ref&gt; Tiresias participated fully in seven generations in Thebes, beginning as advisor to [[Cadmus]] himself.

==Overview==
Eighteen allusions to mythic Tiresias, noted by Luc Brisson,&lt;ref&gt;Luc Brisson, 1976. ''Le mythe de Tirésias: essai d'analyse structurale'' (Leiden: Brill).&lt;/ref&gt; fall into three groups: one, in two episodes, recounts Tiresias' sex-change and his encounter with Zeus and Hera; a second group recounts his blinding by Athena; a third, all but lost, seems to have recounted the misadventures of Tiresias.

Like other [[oracle]]s, how Tiresias obtained his information varied: sometimes, he would receive visions; other times he would listen for the songs of birds, or ask for a description of visions and pictures appearing within the smoke of burnt offerings, and so interpret them. [[Pliny the Elder]] credits Tiresias with the invention of [[auspicy|augury]].&lt;ref&gt;Gaius Plinius Secundus, ''Naturalis Historia'' 7.203.3&lt;/ref&gt;

On [[Mount Cyllene]] in the [[Peloponnese]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Eustathius of Thessalonica|Eustathius]] and [[John Tzetzes]]  place this episode on [[Mount Cithaeron]] in Boeotia, near the territory of Thebes.&lt;/ref&gt; as Tiresias came upon a pair of copulating snakes, he hit the pair with his stick. [[Hera]] was displeased, and she punished Tiresias by transforming him into a woman. As a woman, Tiresias became a priestess of Hera, married and had children, including [[Manto (daughter of Tiresias)|Manto]], who also possessed the gift of prophecy. After seven years as a woman, Tiresias again found mating snakes; depending on the myth, either she made sure to leave the snakes alone this time, or, according to [[Gaius Julius Hyginus|Hyginus]], trampled on them.&lt;ref&gt;''Hygini Fabulae'', LXXV&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, Tiresias was released from his sentence and permitted to regain his masculinity. This ancient story was recorded in [[Lost works| lost lines]] of [[Hesiod]].&lt;ref&gt;According to ''Bibliotheke'' III.6.7, and in [[Phlegon of Tralles|Phlegon]], ''Mirabilia'' 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Hellenistic]] and Roman times Tiresias' sex-change was embellished and expanded into seven episodes, with appropriate amours in each, probably written by the Alexandrian [[Ptolemaeus Chennus]],{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}} but attributed by [[Eustathius of Thessalonica|Eustathius]] to [[Sostratus of Phanagoria]]'s lost [[Elegiac couplet|elegiac]] ''Tiresias''.&lt;ref&gt;Eustathius, ''Commentary on Homer's Odyssey'' 10.494.&lt;/ref&gt; Tiresias is presented as a complexly [[Liminality|liminal]] figure, mediating between humankind and the gods, male and female, blind and seeing, present and future, this world and the [[Underworld]].&lt;ref&gt;Fully explored in [[structuralism|structuralist]] mode, with many analogies drawn from ambivalent sexualities considered to exist among animals in Antiquity, in Brisson 1976.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the mythographic compendium ''[[Bibliotheke]]'',&lt;ref name="Bibliotheke III.6.7"&gt;''Bibliotheke'' III.6.7.&lt;/ref&gt; different stories were told of the cause of his blindness, the most direct being that he was simply blinded by the gods for revealing their secrets. An alternative story told by the poet [[Pherecydes of Leros|Pherecydes]] was followed in [[Callimachus]]' poem "The Bathing of Pallas"; in it, Tiresias was blinded by [[Athena]] after he stumbled onto her bathing naked.&lt;ref&gt;This, readable as a doublet of the [[Actaeon]] [[mytheme]], was the version preferred by the English poets [[Alfred, Lord Tennyson|Tennyson]] and even [[Algernon Charles Swinburne|Swinburne]].&lt;/ref&gt; His mother, Chariclo, a nymph of Athena, begged Athena to undo her curse, but the goddess could not; instead, she cleaned his ears,&lt;ref name="Bibliotheke III.6.7"/&gt; giving him the ability to understand birdsong, thus the gift of [[augury]]. In a separate episode,&lt;ref&gt;The episode is briefly noted by Hyginus, ''Fabula'' 75; [[Ovid]] treats it at length in ''[[Metamorphoses (poem)|Metamorphoses]]'' III.&lt;/ref&gt; Tiresias was drawn into an argument between [[Hera]] and her husband [[Zeus]], on the theme of who has more pleasure in sex: the man, as Hera claimed; or, as Zeus claimed, the woman, as Tiresias had experienced both. Tiresias replied, "Of ten parts a man enjoys one only."&lt;ref&gt;''[[Bibliotheke]]'' III.6.7.&lt;/ref&gt; Hera instantly struck him blind for his [[impiety]]. Zeus could do nothing to stop her or reverse her curse, but in recompense he did give Tiresias the gift of [[second sight|foresight]]&lt;ref&gt;The blind prophet with inner sight as recompense for blindness is a familiar [[mytheme]].&lt;/ref&gt; and a lifespan of seven lives.

He is said to have understood the language of birds and could divine the future from indications in a fire, or smoke. However, it was the communications of the dead he relied on the most, menacing them when they were late to attend him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/livesnecromance04godwgoog|title=Lives of the Necromancers|author=William Godwin|year=1876|pages=46–47}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tiresias makes a dramatic appearance in the ''[[Odyssey]]'', book XI, in which Odysseus calls up the spirits of the dead (the ''[[nekyia]]''). "So sentient is Tiresias, even in death," observes Marina Warner "that he comes up to Odysseus and recognizes him and calls him by name before he has drunk the black blood of the sacrifice; even [[Anticlea|Odysseus' own mother]] cannot accomplish this, but must drink deep before her ghost can see her son for himself."&lt;ref&gt;Warner, Marina. ''Monuments and Maidens: the allegory of the female form''. Berkeley: University of California Press, 2000. p. 329&lt;/ref&gt;

As a seer, "Tiresias" was "a common title for soothsayers throughout Greek legendary history" (Graves 1960, 105.5). In [[Greek literature]], Tiresias' pronouncements are always given in short maxims which are often cryptic ([[gnome (rhetoric)|gnomic]]), but never wrong. Often when his name is attached to a mythic prophecy, it is introduced simply to supply a personality to the generic example of a seer, not by any inherent connection of Tiresias with the myth: thus it is Tiresias who tells Amphytrion of Zeus and Alcmena and warns the mother of [[Narcissus (mythology)|Narcissus]] that the boy will thrive as long as he never [[Know thyself|knows himself]]. This is his emblematic role in [[Greek tragedy|tragedy]] (''see below''). Like most [[oracle]]s, he is generally extremely reluctant to offer the whole of what he sees in his visions.

===Tiresias and Thebes===
[[Image:Johann Heinrich Füssli 063.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Tiresias appears to [[Odysseus]] during the ''[[nekyia]]'' of ''[[Odyssey]]'' xi, in this [[Watercolor painting|watercolor]] with tempera by the Anglo-Swiss [[Johann Heinrich Füssli]], c. 1780-85.]]
Tiresias appears as the name of a recurring character in several stories and [[Greek tragedy|Greek tragedies]] concerning the legendary history of [[Thebes (Greece)|Thebes]]. In ''[[The Bacchae]]'', by [[Euripides]], Tiresias appears with [[Cadmus]], the founder and first king of Thebes, to warn the current king [[Pentheus]] against denouncing [[Dionysus]] as a god. Along with Cadmus, he dresses as a worshiper of Dionysus to go up the mountain to honor the new god with the Theban women in their Bacchic revels.

In [[Sophocles]]' ''[[Oedipus Rex]]'', Oedipus, the king of Thebes, calls upon Tiresias to aid in the investigation of the killing of the previous king [[Laius]]. At first, Tiresias refuses to give a direct answer and instead hints that the killer is someone Oedipus really does not wish to find. However, after being provoked to anger by Oedipus' accusation first that he has no foresight and then that Tiresias had a hand in the murder, he reveals that in fact it was Oedipus himself who had (unwittingly) committed the crime. Outraged, Oedipus throws him out of the palace, but then afterwards realizes the truth.

&lt;!-- Paragraph deleted for irrelevancy. See [[Talk:Tiresias#Irrelevancies]]. 
--&gt;
Tiresias also appears in Sophocles' ''[[Antigone (Sophocles)|Antigone]]''. [[Creon]], now king of Thebes, refuses to allow Polynices to be buried. His niece, [[Antigone]], defies the order and is caught; Creon decrees that she is to be buried alive. The gods express their disapproval of Creon's decision through Tiresias, who tells Creon 'the city is sick through your fault.' 
&lt;!-- Irrelevant half-paragraph deleted, about the effects of the prophecy. See [[Talk:Tiresias#Irrelevancies]]. --&gt;

Tiresias and his prophecy are also involved in the story of the [[Epigoni]].

===Death===
Tiresias died after drinking water from the tainted spring [[Tilphussa]], where he was struck by an arrow of Apollo.

His shade descended to the [[Asphodel Meadows]], the first level of [[Hades]]. After his death, he was visited in the underworld by [[Odysseus]] to whom he gave valuable advice concerning the rest of his odyssey, such as how to get past [[Scylla]] and [[Charybdis]]. He even gave him advice where he should not eat [[The Cattle of Helios|the cattle of Helios]] on [[Thrinacia]] (advice which Odysseus' men did not follow which led to Odysseus' men getting killed by Zeus' thunderbolts during a storm).

==The caduceus==

Connections with the paired serpents on the [[caduceus]] are often made (Brisson 1976:55–57).

'''Van Thomas Barfoot''' (born '''Van Thurman Barfoot'''; June 15, 1919&amp;nbsp;– March 2, 2012) was a [[United States Army]] officer and a recipient of the United States military's highest decoration—the [[Medal of Honor]]—for his actions in [[World War II]].

== Early life ==
Barfoot was born on June 15, 1919, in [[Edinburg, Mississippi]].&lt;ref&gt;Edinburg (ZIP Code 39051) is a small, unincorporated community in Leake County, Mississippi, about {{Convert|12|mi|km}} east of [[Carthage, Mississippi|Carthage]]. ({{Coord|32.799|-89.336}})&lt;/ref&gt; His grandmother was [[Choctaw]], but Barfoot himself was not an official member of the Choctaw Nation; although he was eligible, his parents had never enrolled him.&lt;ref name="collier"&gt;{{Cite book |last=Collier |first=Peter |title=Medal of Honor: Portraits of Valor Beyond the Call of Duty |publisher=[[Workman Publishing Company]] |location=New York |year=2006 |page=16 |isbn=978-1-57965-314-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Military career ==
After enlisting in the Army from [[Carthage, Mississippi]], in 1940 and completing his training, Barfoot served with the [[1st Infantry Division (United States)|1st Infantry Division]] in [[Louisiana]] and [[Puerto Rico]]. In December 1941, he was promoted to [[Sergeant#United States|sergeant]] and reassigned to the Headquarters Amphibious Force Atlantic Fleet in [[Quantico, Virginia]], where he served until the unit was deactivated in 1943. He next joined the [[157th Infantry Regiment (United States)|157th Infantry Regiment]], [[45th Infantry Division (United States)|45th Infantry Division]], and was shipped to Europe.&lt;ref name="collier"/&gt;

=== World War II ===
During the [[Italian Campaign (World War II)|Italian Campaign]] Barfoot participated in a series of amphibious landings: the [[Allied invasion of Sicily]] in July 1943, the [[Allied invasion of Italy|invasion of mainland Italy]] at [[Salerno]] in September 1943, and finally the [[Operation Shingle|landings at Anzio]] in late January 1944. His unit pushed inland from Anzio, and by May 1944 had reached the small town of Carano in southern Italy, in the province of Latina. They set up defensive positions and Barfoot conducted patrols to scout the [[Wehrmacht|German]] lines. When his company was ordered to attack on the morning of 23 May 1944, Barfoot, now a [[technical sergeant]], asked for permission to lead a [[squad]]. Because of the patrols he had made, he knew the terrain and the minefield which lay in front of the German position. He advanced alone through the minefield, following ditches and depressions, until he came within a few yards of a [[machine gun nest]] on the German flank. After taking out the gun and its crew with a [[hand grenade]], he entered the German trench and advanced on a second machine gun, killing two soldiers and capturing three others. When he reached a third machine gun, the entire crew surrendered to him. Others also surrendered, and Barfoot captured a total of seventeen German soldiers and killed eight.&lt;ref name="collier"/&gt;

When the Germans launched an [[armored warfare|armored]] counterattack with three [[Tiger 1|Tiger]] [[tank]]s directly against his positions later that day, Barfoot disabled the lead tank with a [[bazooka]], killed part of its crew with his [[Thompson submachine gun]], and turned the German attack. He then advanced into enemy-held territory and destroyed an abandoned German [[Field artillery|artillery piece]]. He returned to his own lines and helped two wounded soldiers from his squad to the rear.&lt;ref name="collier"/&gt;
[[File:Barfoot-LT.jpg|thumb|150px|left|Van Thomas Barfoot newly promoted US Army Lieutenant circa 1944.]]
Barfoot was subsequently [[commissioned officer|commissioned]] as a [[second lieutenant#United States|second lieutenant]]. His division moved into [[France]], and by September 1944 was serving  in the [[Rhone]] valley. Lt. Barfoot learned he would be awarded the Medal of Honor and chose to have the presentation ceremony in the field, so that his soldiers could attend. He was formally presented with the medal on September 28, 1944, in [[Épinal]], France, by Lieutenant General [[Alexander Patch]].&lt;ref name="collier"/&gt;

=== Post World War ===
Having grown up in the strictly segregated south, Barfoot was noted for a comment he made in 1945 regarding African-Americans. Democratic senator from Mississippi and [[Ku Klux Klan]] member [[Theodore G. Bilbo]] asked Barfoot if he had much trouble with the African-American soldiers he had served with during the war. To Bilbo's embarrassment, Barfoot responded, "I found out after I did some fighting in this war that the colored boys fight just as good as the white boys...I've changed my idea a lot about colored people since I got into this war and so have a lot of other boys from the south".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Cobb | first = James C. | title = World War II and the Mind of the Modern South | work = Remaking Dixie: The Impact of World War II on the American South | publisher = University Press of Mississippi | year = 1997 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=80-wXu1rIWMC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PP1#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Barfoot later served in the Korean War and the Vietnam War, and was awarded a Purple Heart. He reached the rank of [[Colonel (United States)|colonel]] before retiring from the Army.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |publisher = Congressional Medal of Honor Society |title = Full List of Living Recipients |url = http://www.cmohs.org/recipients/living_list_full.htm |accessdate = 2007-08-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; In retirement, he lived on a farm in [[Amelia County, Virginia]] and later moved to, [[Henrico County, Virginia]], near his daughter. On October 9, 2009, the portion of [[Mississippi Highway 16]] which runs from Carthage through his hometown of Edinburg to the border between [[Leake County, Mississippi|Leake]] and [[Neshoba County, Mississippi|Neshoba]] counties was named the "Van T. Barfoot Medal of Honor Highway".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.wlbt.com/Global/story.asp?S=11290944|title=Van T. Barfoot Medal of Honor Highway named|date=October 9, 2009|publisher=[[WLBT]]|accessdate=October 14, 2009|location=Jackson, Mississippi}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A building at [[Hunter Holmes McGuire Veterans Administration Medical Center|McGuire Veterans Hospital]] in Richmond, VA also carries his name.

==Medal of Honor citation==
Second Lieutenant Barfoot's official Medal of Honor citation reads:
[[File:Barfoot-MOH.jpg|thumb|right|Lt. Van Thomas Barfoot (right) after being awarded the Medal of Honor by Lt. General Alexander Patch on 22 September 1944 in Epinal, France.]]
:&lt;blockquote&gt;For conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity at the risk of life above and beyond the call of duty on 23 May 1944, near Carano, Italy. With his platoon heavily engaged during an assault against forces well entrenched on commanding ground, 2d Lt. Barfoot (then Tech. Sgt.) moved off alone upon the enemy left flank. He crawled to the proximity of 1 machinegun nest and made a direct hit on it with a [[hand grenade]], killing 2 and wounding 3 Germans. He continued along the German defense line to another machinegun emplacement, and with his [[Tommy gun|tommygun]] killed 2 and captured 3 soldiers. Members of another enemy machinegun crew then abandoned their position and gave themselves up to Sgt. Barfoot. Leaving the prisoners for his support squad to pick up, he proceeded to mop up positions in the immediate area, capturing more prisoners and bringing his total count to 17. Later that day, after he had reorganized his men and consolidated the newly captured ground, the enemy launched a fierce armored counterattack directly at his platoon positions. Securing a bazooka, Sgt. Barfoot took up an exposed position directly in front of 3 advancing [[Tiger I|Mark VI]] tanks. From a distance of 75 yards his first shot destroyed the [[Caterpillar track|track]] of the leading tank, effectively disabling it, while the other 2 changed direction toward the flank. As the crew of the disabled tank dismounted, Sgt. Barfoot killed 3 of them with his tommygun. He continued onward into enemy terrain and destroyed a recently abandoned German fieldpiece with a demolition charge placed in the [[Breech-loading weapon|breech]]. While returning to his platoon position, Sgt. Barfoot, though greatly fatigued by his Herculean efforts, assisted 2 of his seriously wounded men 1,700 yards to a position of safety. Sgt. Barfoot's extraordinary heroism, demonstration of magnificent valor, and aggressive determination in the face of pointblank fire are a perpetual inspiration to his fellow soldiers.&lt;ref name="citation"&gt;{{Cite web |publisher=[[United States Army Center of Military History]] |title=Medal of Honor recipients – World War II (A–F) |work=Medal of Honor citations |date=June 8, 2009 |url=http://www.history.army.mil/html/moh/wwII-a-f.html |accessdate=August 2, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Flagpole dispute==
In December 2009, the [[homeowners' association]] (HOA) of the Sussex Square, where Barfoot lived in [[Henrico County, Virginia]], ordered him to remove the {{convert|21|ft|m|adj=on}} flagpole he had erected without their approval and from which he began flying the US flag regularly on Veterans Day.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; The HOA retained the Coates &amp; Davenport law firm&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.coateslaw.com/ Coates &amp; Davenport, P.C.]&lt;/ref&gt; to threaten legal action to enforce their order.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; This news story first became public when Barfoot's son-in-law reported the story on local talk radio show, ''[[Elliot in the Morning]]''. Then [[Fox News]] and several other news networks picked up the story nationally. The association's bylaws do not forbid flagpoles, but the HOA ruled Barfoot, then aged 90, would not be allowed to use it "for aesthetic reasons." Barfoot contested their order,&lt;ref&gt;

'''Yu Jie''' ({{zh|c = 余杰}}), is a Chinese writer and democracy activist. The bestselling author of more than 30 books, Yu was described by the ''[[New York Review of Books]]'' in 2012 as "one of China's most prominent essayists and critics".&lt;ref name=NYRB /&gt;

Yu Jie is also active in the [[Chinese dissident]] movement, and was arrested and allegedly tortured in 2010 for his friendship with [[Nobel Peace Prize]] laureate [[Liu Xiaobo]] and a critical biography of Prime Minister [[Wen Jiabao]] titled ''[[China's Best Actor: Wen Jiabao|China's Best Actor]]''. Following more than a year of house arrest, Yu emigrated to the US with his family in January 2012. Later that year, he was awarded the [[Civil Courage Prize]] of the [[Train Foundation]].

==Early writing career==
Originally from [[Chengdu]], Yu attended [[Peking University]] and majored in modern [[Chinese literature]].&lt;ref name=NYTWong2 /&gt;

His first book, ''Fire and Ice'', included extensive political and social criticism. Upon its 1999 publication, Yu became a "literary sensation".

==2010 arrest==
Yu was detained by security officials in July 2010 to discuss his upcoming book ''[[China's Best Actor: Wen Jiabao]]'', "a scathing critique" of China's [[Wen Jiabao|prime minister]] that Yu intended to publish in [[Hong Kong]].&lt;ref name=NYTWines /&gt;&lt;ref name=NYTWong /&gt; The book argued that Wen's warm, empathic public persona was simply a facade, and that he shared the same goals of other Chinese leaders.&lt;ref name=BBC&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-pacific-10983310 |title=Book critical of Chinese PM Wen Jiabao goes on sale |date=August 16, 2010 |publisher=BBC News |archivedate=September 10, 2012 |deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6Aa81MUUO |accessdate=September 10, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Yu, one official stated that his book was "harming state security and the national interest", and if it were published, Yu would probably be imprisoned "for many years".&lt;ref name=NYTWines /&gt; Yu nonetheless proceeded with publication of the book in August.&lt;ref name=BBC /&gt;

On October 8, 2010, Yu's good friend [[Liu Xiaobo]] was named the winner of the [[Nobel Peace Prize]]. On October 13, Yu was placed under house arrest, allegedly for his plans to write a biography of Liu as well as for having proceeded with the publication of ''China's Best Actor''.&lt;ref name=NYTWong /&gt; He later wrote that during this period, "I was tortured by the country’s secret police and nearly lost my life".&lt;ref name=WP2&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/the-myth-of-china-as-a-harmless-tiger/2012/02/10/gIQAb7DxBR_story.html |title=The myth of China as a harmless tiger |author=Yu Jie |date=February 13, 2012 |work=The Washington Post |archivedate=September 10, 2012|deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6Aa4IvTkf |accessdate=September 10, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Yu, he was stripped naked, burned with cigarettes, and beaten until he was hospitalized.&lt;ref name=WP&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/chinese-dissident-details-alleged-torture/2012/01/18/gIQAuDIJ9P_story.html |title=Chinese dissident details alleged torture |author=William Wan |date=January 18, 2012 |work=The Washington Post |archivedate=September 10, 2012 |deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6Aa4cvZva |accessdate=September 10, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His house arrest, and a concomitant travel ban, lasted until January 2012, at which point he and his family emigrated to the US.&lt;ref name=NYTWong&gt;{{cite news|title=China: Dissident Author Flees to U.S.|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/19/world/asia/china-dissident-author-flees-to-us.html|accessdate=January 19, 2012|newspaper=The New York Times|date=January 18, 2012|author=Edward Wong}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following his emigration, he submitted a nine-page report detailing his alleged torture to the [[US State Department]] and the [[United Nations Human Rights Council]]. He stated that he was continuing to write Liu's biography, and was also at work on a new biography of Chinese president Hu Jintao titled "Hu Jintao: Cold-Blooded Tyrant".&lt;ref name=WP /&gt;

==Personal life==
Yu has a wife, Liu Min, and one son, Yu Guangyi.&lt;ref name=NYTWong2&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/26/world/asia/yu-jie-dissident-chinese-writer-continues-his-work-in-us.html?pagewanted=all |title=From Virginia Suburb, a Dissident Chinese Writer Continues His Mission |author=Edward Wong |date=February 25, 2012 |work=The New York Times|deadurl=no |archivedate=September 10, 2012 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6Aa673CxU |accessdate=September 10, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He converted to Christianity in 2003,&lt;ref name=NYTWong2 /&gt; and in China was a member of a [[Chinese house church|house church]].&lt;ref name=WP2 /&gt;

In 2012, Yu was named the winner of the 2012 [[Civil Courage Prize]] of the US-based [[Train Foundation]].&lt;ref name=CCP2012 /&gt; The prize recognizes "steadfast resistance to evil at great personal risk — rather than military valor."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.civilcourageprize.org/index.htm |title=Civil Courage Prize |year=2012 |publisher=Civil Courage Prize|deadurl=no |archivedate=August 11, 2012 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/69qPLl2L5 |accessdate=August 10, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The prize comes with a $50,000 honorarium.
