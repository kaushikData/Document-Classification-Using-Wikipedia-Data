'''Albert von Kölliker''' (born ''Rudolf Albert Kölliker;'' 6 July 1817{{snd}}2 November 1905) was a [[Switzerland|Swiss]] [[anatomist]], [[physiologist]], and [[Histology|histologist]].

==Biography==
Albert Kölliker was born in [[Zurich]], [[Switzerland]].  His early education was carried on in Zurich, and he entered the university there in 1836. After two years, however, he moved to the [[University of Bonn]], and later to that of [[Berlin]], becoming a pupil of noted physiologists [[Johannes Peter Müller]] and of [[Friedrich Gustav Jakob Henle]]. He graduated in [[philosophy]] at Zurich in 1841, and in medicine at [[Heidelberg]] in 1842. The first academic post which he held was that of [[prosector]] of [[anatomy]] under Henle, but his tenure of this office was brief{{snd}}in 1844 he returned to Zurich University to occupy a chair as professor extraordinary of [[physiology]] and [[comparative anatomy]]. His stay here was also brief; in 1847 the [[University of Würzburg]], attracted by his rising fame, offered him the post of professor of physiology and of microscopical and comparative anatomy. He accepted the appointment, and at Würzburg he remained thenceforth, refusing all offers tempting him to leave the quiet academic life of the [[Bavaria]]n town, where he died.{{sfn|Foster|1911|p=889}}

At Zurich, and afterwards at Würzburg, the title of the chair which Kölliker held laid upon him the duty of teaching comparative anatomy. Many of the numerous memoirs which he published, (including the very first paper he wrote) and which appeared in 1841, before he graduated, were on the structure of animals of the most varied kinds. Notable among these were his papers on the ''[[Medusae]]'' and allied creatures. His activity in this direction led him to make [[zoology|zoological]] excursions to the [[Mediterranean Sea]] and to the coasts of [[Scotland]], as well as to undertake, conjointly with his friend [[Carl Theodor Ernst von Siebold]], the editorship of the ''Zeitschrift für Wissenschaftliche Zoologie'', which, founded in 1848, continued under his hands to be one of the most important zoological periodicals.{{sfn|Foster|1911|p=890}}

His hand was one of the first to be x-rayed, by his friend [[Wilhelm Roentgen]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.christies.com/lotfinder/books-manuscripts/rontgen-wilhelm-conrad-ueber-eine-neue-5084328-details.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;

==Works==
Kölliker made contributions to the study of [[zoology]]. His earlier efforts were directed to the [[invertebrates]], and his memoir on the development of [[cephalopod]]s (which appeared in 1844) is considered a classical work.  He soon passed on to the [[vertebrates]], and studied the [[amphibia]]ns and [[mammal]]ian [[embryo]]s. He was among the first, if not the very first, to introduce into this branch of biological inquiry the newer [[microscopy|microscopic technique]] – the methods of hardening, sectioning and [[staining (biology)|staining]]. By doing so, not only was he enabled to make rapid progress himself, but he also placed in the hands of others the means of a similar advancement. The remarkable strides forward which [[embryology]] made during the middle and latter half of the 19th century will always be associated with his name. His ''Lectures on Development'', published in 1861, at once became a standard work.{{sfn|Foster|1911|p=890}}

But neither zoology nor embryology furnished Kölliker's chief claim to fame. If he did much for these branches of science, he did still more for [[histology]], the knowledge of the minute structure of the animal [[Biological tissue|tissues]]. Among his earlier results was the demonstration in 1847 that [[smooth muscle|smooth]] or unstriated muscle is made up of distinct units, of nucleated muscle cells. In this work, he followed in the footsteps of his master Henle. A few years before this, there was doubt whether [[arteries]] had muscle in their walls – in addition, no solid histological basis as yet existed for those views as to the action of the [[nervous system]] on the [[circulatory system|circulation]], which were soon to be put forward, and which had such a great influence on the progress of physiology.{{sfn|Foster|1911|p=890}}

Kölliker's contributions to histology were widespread; [[smooth muscle]], [[striated muscle]], [[skin]], [[bone]], [[teeth]], [[blood vessel]]s and [[viscera]] were all investigated by Kölliker, and he touched none of them without discovering new truths. The results at which he arrived were recorded partly in separate memoirs, partly in his great textbook on microscopical anatomy, which first saw the light in 1850, and by which he advanced histology no less than by his own researches.{{sfn|Foster|1911|p=890}}

[[Albert L. Lehninger]] asserted that Kölliker was among the first to notice the arrangement of granules in the [[sarcoplasm]] of striated muscle over a period of years beginning around 1850. These granules were later called sarcosomes by [[Gustaf Retzius|Retzius]] in 1890. These sarcosomes have come to be known as the [[mitochondria]]-the power houses of the cell. In the words of Lehninger, "Kölliker should also be credited with the first separation of mitochondria from cell structure. In 1888 he teased these granules from insect muscle, in which they are very profuse, found them to swell in water, and showed them to possess a [[Inner nuclear membrane|membrane]]."{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}}

In the case of almost every tissue, our present knowledge contains information first discovered by Kölliker – it is for his work on the [[nervous system]] that his name is most remembered. As early as 1845, while still at Zurich, he supplied the clear proof that [[nerve fiber]]s are continuous with [[nerve cells]], and so furnished the absolutely necessary basis for all sound speculations as to the actions of the [[central nervous system]].{{sfn|Foster|1911|p=890}}

From that time onward he continually laboured at the histology of the nervous system, and more especially at the difficult problems presented by the intricate patterns in which [[nerve fiber]]s and [[neuron]]s are woven together in the [[brain]] and [[spinal cord]].  From his early days a master of method, he saw at a glance the value of the new [[Golgi's method|Golgi staining method]] for the investigation of the central nervous system, and, to the great benefit of science, took up once more in his old age, with the aid of a new means, the studies for which he had done so much in his youth. Kölliker contributed greatly to knowledge of the inner structure of the [[brain]].{{sfn|Foster|1911|p=890}}&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/details/handbuchdergeweb02kl ''Handbuch der Gewebelehre des Menschen'', t. 2, Leipzig, 1896.] (in German).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Honors==

Kölliker was ennobled by [[Prince Regent]] [[Luitpold, Prince Regent of Bavaria|Luitpold of Bavaria]] in 1897 and thus permitted to add the predicate "[[von]]" to his surname.{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}} He was made a member of the learned societies of many countries; in [[England]], which he visited more than once, and where he became well known, the [[Royal Society]] made him a fellow in 1860, and in 1897 gave him its highest token of esteem, the [[Copley medal]].{{sfn|Foster|1911|p=890}}

==Heterogenesis==
{{further|Saltationism}}

In 1864 Kölliker revived [[Étienne Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire]]'s theory that [[evolution]] proceeds by large steps ([[saltationism]]), under the name of heterogenesis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |authorlink=Sewall Wright |first=Sewall |last=Wright |year=1984 |title=Evolution and the Genetics of Populations: Genetics and Biometric Foundations |volume=1 |publisher=University of Chicago Press |page=10 |isbn=0226910490 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Kölliker was a critic of [[Darwinism]] and rejected a [[universal common ancestor]], instead he supported a theory of [[common descent]] along separate lines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Mario A. |last=Di Gregorio |year=2005 |title=From Here to Eternity: Ernst Haeckel and Scientific Faith |publisher=Vandenhoeck &amp; Ruprecht |page=303 |isbn=3525569726 }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Alexander Vucinich]] the non-Darwinian evolution theory of Kölliker tied "organic transformism to three general ideas, all contrary to Darwin's view: the multiple origin of living forms, the internal causes of variation, and "sudden leaps" (heterogenesis) in the evolutionary process."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Alexander |last=Vucinich |year=1988 |title=Darwin in Russian Thought |publisher=University of California Press |page=137 |isbn=0520062833 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Kölliker claimed that heterogenesis functioned according to a general law of evolutionary progress, [[orthogenesis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |authorlink=Thomas F.

{{Tort law}}
The '''attractive nuisance doctrine''' applies to the [[law]] of [[torts]], in the United States. It states that a [[Land tenure|landowner]] may be held [[liable]] for [[Injury|injuries]] to [[children]] [[trespass]]ing on the land if the injury is caused by an object on the land that is likely to attract children.&lt;ref name="CottenWolohan2003"/&gt;  The doctrine is designed to protect children who are unable to appreciate the risk posed by the object, by imposing a liability on the landowner.&lt;ref name="CottenWolohan2003"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cotten|first1=Doyice|last2=Wolohan|first2=John T.|title=Law for Recreation and Sport Managers|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YO80DTGw1MEC&amp;pg=PA208|accessdate=9 November 2014|year=2003|publisher=Kendall/Hunt Publishing Company|isbn=9780787299682|pages=208–}}&lt;/ref&gt; The doctrine has been applied to hold landowners liable for injuries caused by [[abandoned car]]s, piles of [[lumber]] or [[sand]], [[trampoline]]s, and [[swimming pool]]s. However, it can be applied to virtually anything on the property of the landowner.

There is no set cut off point that defines youth. The courts will evaluate each "child" on case by case basis to see if the "child" qualifies as a youth.

If it is determined that the child was able to understand and appreciate the hazard, the doctrine of attractive nuisance will not likely apply.&lt;ref&gt;Holland V. Baltimore &amp; Ohio Railroad Co. 431 A.2d 597 (D.C. 1981).&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the old [[common law]], the [[plaintiff]] (either the child, or a parent suing on the child's behalf) had to show that it was the hazardous condition itself which lured the child onto the landowner's property. However, most jurisdictions have statutorily altered this condition, and now require only that the injury was foreseeable by the landowner.

==Conditions==
According to the [[Restatement of Torts]] standard, which is followed in many jurisdictions, there are five conditions that must be met for a [[Property|land owner]] to be liable for tort damages to a child trespasser as a result of '''artificial''' hazards. 

===Elements=== 
*The place where the condition exists is one on which the possessor knows or has reason to know that children are likely to trespass, and
*The condition is one of which the possessor knows or has reason to know and which he realizes or should realize will involve an unreasonable risk of death or serious [[bodily harm]] to such children,
*The children, because of their youth, do not discover the condition or realize the risk involved in inter-meddling with it or in coming within the area made dangerous by it
*The utility to the possessor of maintaining the condition and the burden of eliminating the danger are slight as compared with the risk to children involved, and
*The possessor fails to exercise [[Duty of care|reasonable care]] to eliminate the danger or otherwise to protect the children

(See Restatement of Torts §339)
==Jurisdictions==

States that use the Restatement test include:

*[[Alabama]]; adopted in 1976 case, Tolbert v. Gulsby
*[[North Carolina]]
*[[Ohio]]&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; see case: ''Bennett v. Stanley'', 92 Ohio St.3d 35 (2001)&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.sconet.state.oh.us/rod/docs/pdf/0/2001/2001-ohio-128.pdf Text of opinion from Ohio Supreme Court's web site]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Tibetan Buddhism}}

'''Chöd''' ({{bo|t=གཅོད|w=gcod}} lit. 'to sever'&lt;ref&gt;"Chöd Teachings &amp; Practice His Eminence Garchen Rinpoche January 1–5, 2011, 9:00&amp;nbsp;am to 5:00&amp;nbsp;pm Chöd literally means "to sever." What we sever is not anything in the outside world, but rather we cut through our ego-clinging, which is the very root of our afflictive emotions and suffering." - current version of http://www.garchen.net/schedule.html&lt;/ref&gt;), is a spiritual practice found primarily in the [[Nyingma]] and [[Kagyu]] schools of [[Tibetan Buddhism]] (where it is classed as [[Anuttarayoga Tantra]]).&lt;ref name=chaoul&gt;{{cite book|last=Chaoul|first=M Alejandro|title=Chod practice in the Bon tradition|date=2009|publisher=Snow Lion Publications|location=Ithaca, N.Y.|isbn=9781559392921}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also known as "Cutting Through the Ego,",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bodhicitta.net/Chod.htm|title=Chod - Cutting Through the Ego|last=Rinpoche|first=Yangthang |year=1991|accessdate=2009-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; the practices are based on the [[Prajnaparamita|Prajñāpāramitā]] or "Perfection of Wisdom" sutras, which expound the "[[Śūnyatā|emptiness]]" concept of [[Buddhist philosophy]].

According to [[Mahayana]] Buddhists, emptiness is the ultimate wisdom of understanding that all things lack inherent existence. Chöd combines prajñāpāramitā philosophy with specific meditation methods and  [[Vajrayana|tantric]] ritual. The chod practitioner seeks to tap the power of fear through activities such as rituals set in graveyards, and visualisation of offering their bodies in a [[ganachakra|tantric feast]] in order to put their understanding of emptiness to the ultimate test.{{sfn|Machig Labdrön|2003|p=55}}

==Nomenclature, orthography and etymology==
{{bo|t=གཅོད་སྒྲུབ་ཐབས་|w=gcod sgrub thabs}} and [[Sanskrit]] ''chedasādhanā'' both literally mean "cutting practice".

In [[Standard Tibetan]] (the prestige dialect associated with Buddhism that is based on the speech of [[Lhasa]]), the pronunciation of ''gcod'' is [[International Phonetic Alphabet|IPA]] /{{IPA|tɕøː}}/.

==Key elements of the practice==
Chöd literally means "cutting through". It cuts through [[Kleshas (Buddhism)|hindrances and obscurations]], sometimes called 'demons' or 'gods'. Examples of demons are [[ignorance]], [[anger]] and, in particular, the [[Dualism (Indian philosophy)|dualism]] of perceiving the self as inherently meaningful, contrary to the Buddhist doctrine of [[anatta|no-self]]. The practitioner is fully immersed in the ritual:  "With a stunning array of visualizations, song, music, and prayer, it engages every aspect of one’s being and effects a powerful transformation of the interior landscape."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Harding|first=Sarah|title=Machik's Complete Explanation Clarifing the Meaning of Chod|publisher=Snow Lion Publications|year=2003|chapter=Preface|isbn=1-55939-182-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Dzogchen]] forms of Chöd enable the practitioner to maintain [[rigpa|primordial awareness]] free from fear. Here, the Chöd ritual essentialises elements of [[phowa]], [[ganachakra|gaṇacakra]], [[pāramitā]] and [[lojong]]&lt;ref&gt;Thrangu, Khenchen &amp; Klonk, Christoph (translator) &amp; Hollmann, Gaby (editor and annotator)(2006).

Chöd usually commences with phowa, in which the practitioner visualises their [[mindstream]] as the [[Five Pure Lights]] leaving the body through the aperture of the [[sahasrara]] at the top of the head. This is said to ensure psychic integrity of, and compassion for the [[sādhaka]] or practitioner.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}} In most versions of the [[sādhanā]], the mindstream precipitates into a [[tulpa]] simulacrum of [[Vajrayogini|Vajrayoginī]]. In [[sambhogakāya]] attained through visualization, the sādhaka offers a gaṇachakra of their own physical body to the "four" guests: the [[Three Jewels]], [[dakini]]s, [[dharmapala]]s and beings of the [[Bhavacakra|bhavachakra]], the ever-present [[lokapala]] and the [[preta]]s. The rite may be protracted with separate offerings to each [[mandala|maṇḍala]] of guests, or significantly abridged. Many versions of the chod sādhana' still exist.&lt;ref&gt;[http://lionsroar.name/tantric_glossary.htm Tantric Glossary:Chöd] (September 29, 2008)&lt;/ref&gt;

The chöd sadhana generally includes music, song and also a dance.

Chöd, like all tantric systems, has outer, inner and secret aspects. They are described in an [[evocation]] sung to Nyama Paldabum by [[Milarepa]]:
{{quote|External chod is to wander in fearful places where there are deities and demons. Internal chod is to offer one's own body as food to the deities and demons. Ultimate chod is to realize the true nature of the mind and cut through the fine strand of hair of subtle ignorance. I am the yogi who has these three kinds of chod practice.&lt;ref name="Thrangu, Khenchen 2007"&gt;Thrangu, Khenchen &amp; Klonk, Christoph (translator) &amp; Hollmann, Gaby (editor and annotator)(2006). ''Chod – The Introduction &amp; A Few Practices''. Source: [http://www.rinpoche.com/teachings/chod.htm] (accessed: November 2, 2007)&lt;/ref&gt; }}
Chöd is now a staple of the advanced ''sādhana'' of Tibetan Buddhism. It is practiced worldwide following dissemination by the [[Tibetan diaspora]].

[[Vajrayogini]] is a key figure in the advanced practice of Chöd, where she appears in her Kālikā ({{bo|w=khros ma nag mo}}) or [[Vajravārāhī]] ({{bo|w=rdo rje phag mo}}) forms. The practices of Tröma Nagmo "Extremely Wrathful Black Mother" associated with the Dakini Tröma Nagmo (the black form of Vajrayogini) were also propagated by Machig Labdrön. "The particular transmission which His Holiness will give descends from [[Dudjom Lingpa]], who received it in a direct vision of the Indian Mahasiddha, [[Saraha]]. This practice emphasizes cutting through grasping at the dualistic mind to realize complete selfless compassion.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.omura.com/k_lingpa/Klingpa2.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; One of the forms of this style of Chöd can be found in the [[Dudjom Jigdral Yeshe Dorje|Dudjom Tersar]] lineage.

==Indian antecedents==
"Chöd was never a unique, monolithic tradition. One should really speak of Chöd tradition'''s''' and lineage'''s''' since Chöd has never constituted a school."{{sfn|Edou|1996|page=7}}

A form of Chöd was practiced in India by Buddhist [[Mahasiddha|mahāsiddha]]s prior to the 10th century.&lt;ref name="books.google.co.uk"&gt;{{cite book|last=Edou|first=Jérôme|title=Machig Labdrön and the Foundations of Chöd|publisher=Snow Lion Publications|year=1996|isbn=978-1-55939-039-2|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AQULAAAAYAAJ&amp;}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two practices of Chöd in Buddhism and in [[Bön]] are distinct lineages.&lt;ref name=chaoul /&gt;

There are two main Chöd traditions within Buddhism, the "Mother" and "Father" lineages. [[Dampa Sangye]] is known as the "Father of Chöd" and [[Machig Labdrön]], founder of the Mahamudra Chöd [[Lineage (Buddhism)|lineage]]s, as the "Mother of Chöd".

Bön traces the origin of Chöd to the ''Secret Mother Tantra'', the seventh of the Nine Vehicles of Bön practice. There are four distinct styles of Chöd practice.&lt;ref name=chaoul /&gt;

Chöd developed outside the monastic system. It was subsequently adopted by the monastic lineages. As an internalization of an outer ritual, Chöd involves a form of self-sacrifice: the practitioner visualizes their own body as the offering at a ganachakra. The purpose of the practice is to engender a sense of victory and fearlessness.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}} These two qualities are represented iconographically by the [[dhvaja|victory banner]] and the [[kartika (knife)|ritual knife]]. The banner symbolizes overcoming obstacles and the knife symbolizes cutting through the ego. The practitioner may cultivate imaginary fearful or painful situations since they help the practitioner's work of cutting through attachment to the self. Machig Labdrön said, "To consider adversity as a friend is the instruction of Chöd".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Edou|first=Jérôme|title=Machig Labdrön and the Foundations of Chöd|publisher=Snow Lion Publications|year=1996|page=43|isbn=978-1-55939-039-2|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AQULAAAAYAAJ&amp;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chödpa as 'mad saints'===
[[Sarat Chandra Das]], writing at the turn of the 20th Century, equated the Chöd practitioner ({{bo|t=གཅོད་པ|w=gcod pa}}) with the Indian ''[[avadhuta|avadhūta]]'', or "mad saint".&lt;ref&gt;Sarat Chandra Das, Graham Sandberg &amp; Augustus William Heyde (1902). ''Tibetan-English Dictionary with Sanskrit Synonyms''. Calcutta, India: Bengal Secretariat Book Depot, p.20. Source: [https://books.google.com/books?id=8AbIHweo7PMC&amp;pg=PA20&amp;lpg=PA20&amp;dq=Avadhauts&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=otPppa3w8u&amp;sig=dKZoJzveyvIBeRlj60nHoBSIBWY&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=b9VwS5DEH8qHkAWYp9SFCg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CAcQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Avadhauts&amp;f=false] (accessed: Tuesday February 9, 2010)&lt;/ref&gt; ''Avadhūtas'' - called [[nyönpa]] in Tibetan Buddhism - are renowned for expressing their spiritual understanding through "[[crazy wisdom]]" inexplicable to ordinary people. Chöd practitioners are a type of Mad Saint particularly respected, feared or held in awe due to their roles as  denizens of the [[charnel ground]]. According to [[Tibetology|tibetologist]] Jérôme Édou, Chod practitioners were often associated with the role of [[shamanism|shaman]] and [[exorcist]]:
{{quote|The Chö[d]pa's very lifestyle on the fringe of society - dwelling in the solitude of burial grounds and haunted places, added to the mad behavior and contact with the world of darkness and mystery - was enough for credulous people to view the Chödpa in a role usually attributed to shamans and other exorcists, an assimilation which also happened to medieval European shepherds. Only someone who has visited one of Tibet's charnel fields and witnessed the offering of a corpse to the vultures may be able to understand the full impact of what the Chöd tradition refers to as places that inspire terror.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Edou|first=Jérôme|title=Machig Labdrön and the Foundations of Chöd|publisher=Snow Lion Publications|year=1996|isbn=978-1-55939-039-2|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AQULAAAAYAAJ&amp;}}, p.61&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Iconography==
In Chöd, the adept symbolically offers the flesh of their body in a form of [[ganachakra|gaṇacakra]] or tantric feast. [[Iconography|Iconographically]], the skin of the practitioner's body may represent surface reality or ''[[Maya (illusion)|maya]]''. It is cut from bones that represent the true reality of the [[mindstream]]. Commentators have pointed out the similarities between the Chöd ritual and the prototypical [[initiation]] of a [[Shamanism|shaman]], although one writer identifies an essential difference between the two in that the shaman's initiation is involuntary whilst a Chodpa chooses to undertake the ritual death of a Chod ceremony.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Alliance|first=Tsultrim|title=Women of Wisdom|year=1984|publisher=Snow Lion Publications|isbn=1559398949|page=128|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2ijwIHDd13cC&amp;pg=PA128&amp;dq=chod+ritual+shaman+initiation&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=m7wtUsD2FfOg7Abq7IGoDw&amp;ved=0CDQQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=chod%20ritual%20shaman%20initiation&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Traditionally, Chöd is regarded as challenging, potentially dangerous and inappropriate for some practitioners.&lt;ref&gt;[[Mircea Eliade|Eliade, Mircea]] (1989), "Histoire des croyances et des idées religieuses" Tome 3, § 316, Ed. Payot. {{ISBN|978-2-228-88160-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ritual objects ===
[[File:Chöd practitioners at Boudhanath stupa.jpg|thumb|Chöd practitioners at Boudhanath stupa]]
Practitioners of the Chöd ritual, ''Chödpa,'' use a [[kangling]] or human thighbone trumpet, and a Chöd drum, a hand drum similar to but larger than the [[damaru|ḍamaru]] commonly used in Tibetan ritual. In a version of the Chöd [[sādhanā]] of [[Jigme Lingpa]] from the  ''[[Longchen Nyingthig]]'', five [[Kīla (Buddhism)|ritual knives]] are employed to demarcate the [[mandala|maṇḍala]] of the offering and to affix the [[five wisdoms]].&lt;ref&gt;Jigme Lingpa (revealed; undated); Liljenberg, Karen (translator; 2006)[http://www.zangthal.co.uk/files.html The Longchen Nyingthig Chöd Practice "The Loud Laugh of the Dakini"]&lt;/ref&gt;

Key to the iconography of Chöd is the [[Kartika (knife)|{{IAST|kartikā}}]] ({{bo|t=གྲི་གུ,་སྐྱི་གྲི|w=gri gu, skyi gri}}), a half-moon blade knife for skinning an animal and for [[Scraper (archaeology)|scraping hides]]. The practitioner symbolically uses a kartika to separate the [[Bodymind (in meditation traditions)|bodymind]] from the [[mindstream]] in ritual.&lt;ref name="keithdowman"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.keithdowman.net/essays/guide.htm|title=Keith Dowman / Buddhist Guide to the Kathmandu Valley|publisher=keithdowman.net|accessdate=2014-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kartika imagery in Chöd rituals provides the practitioner with an opportunity to realize Buddhist doctrine:{{quote|The Kartika (Skt.) or curved knife symbolizes the cutting of conventional wisdom by the ultimate insight into [[Śūnyatā|emptiness]]. It is usually present as a pair, together with the [[kapala|skullcup]], filled with wisdom nectar. On a more simple level, the skull is a reminder of (our) [[impermanence]]. Between the knife and the handle is a [[makara (Hindu mythology)|makara]]-head, a mythical monster.&lt;ref&gt;[http://buddhism.kalachakranet.org/tantra_symbols.html Tantric Symbols]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Origins of the practice==
[[File:Machik Labdron.jpg|thumb|Machik Labdron]]
[[File:Padampa Sanggye.jpg|thumb|Padampa Sanggye]]
Some sources have described [[Machig Labdrön]] as the founder of the practice of Chöd.&lt;ref&gt;Beyer, Stephen (1973). ''The Cult of Tara''. University of California Press. {{ISBN|0-520-03635-2}} p.47&lt;/ref&gt;  This is accurate in that she is the founder of the Tibetan Buddhist Mahamudrā Chöd [[lineage (Buddhism)|lineage]]s. Machig Labdrön is credited with providing the name "Chöd" and developing unique approaches to the practice.&lt;ref&gt;Thrangu, Khenchen &amp; Klonk, Christoph (translator) &amp; Hollmann, Gaby (editor and annotator)(2006). [http://www.rinpoche.com/teachings/chod.htm Chod – The Introduction &amp; A Few Practices]. (accessed: November 2, 2007)&lt;/ref&gt; Biographies suggest it was transmitted to her via sources of the mahāsiddha and tantric traditions.&lt;ref name="books.google.co.uk"/&gt; She did not found the [[Dzogchen]] lineages, although they do recognize her, and she does not appear at all in the Bön Chöd lineages.&lt;ref name="books.google.co.uk"/&gt; Among the formative influences on Mahamudrā Chöd was [[Dampa Sangye]]'s ''Pacification of Suffering'' ({{bo|w=zhi byed}}).

===The transmission of Chöd to Tibet===
There are several [[Hagiography|hagiographic]] accounts of how Chöd came to Tibet.&lt;ref name="books.google.co.uk"/&gt;  One [[Namtar (biography)|namtar]] (spiritual biography) asserts that shortly after [[Kamalaśīla]] won his famous debate with [[Moheyan]] as to whether Tibet should adopt the "sudden" route to enlightenment or his "gradual" route, Kamalaśīla used the technique of [[phowa]] to transfer his [[mindstream]] to animate a corpse polluted with contagion in order to safely move the hazard it presented. As the mindstream of Kamalaśīla was otherwise engaged, a mahasiddha by the name of Dampa Sangye came across the vacant "physical basis"&lt;ref&gt;''kuten''&lt;/ref&gt; of Kamalaśīla. Padampa Sangye, was not karmically blessed with an aesthetic corporeal form, and upon finding the very handsome and healthy empty body of Kamalaśīla, which he assumed to be a newly dead fresh corpse, used phowa to transfer his own mindstream into Kamalaśīla's body. Padampa Sangye's mindstream in Kamalaśīla's body continued the ascent to the Himalaya and thereby transmitted the Pacification of Suffering teachings and the Indian form of Chöd which contributed to the Mahamudra Chöd of Machig Labdrön. The mindstream of Kamalaśīla was unable to return to his own body and so was forced to enter the vacant body of Padampa Sangye.&lt;ref name="Thrangu, Khenchen 2007"/&gt;&lt;ref name="lionsroar"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lionsroar.name/tantric_glossary.htm|title=Tantric Glossary|publisher=lionsroar.name|accessdate=2014-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Third Karmapa: systematizer of Chöd===
Chöd was a marginal and peripheral practice, and the Chödpas who engaged in it were from outside traditional Tibetan Buddhist and Indian monastic institutions, with a contraindication against all but the most advanced practitioners to go to the [[charnel ground]]s to practice. Texts concerning Chöd were both exclusive and rare in the early tradition school.{{sfn|Edou|1996|p=7}} Indeed, due to the itinerant and nomadic lifestyles of practitioners, they could carry few texts. Hence they were also known as ''kusulu'' or ''kusulupa'', that is, studying texts rarely whilst focusing on meditation and [[praxis (process)|praxis]]: "The nonconventional attitude of living on the fringe of society kept the Chödpas aloof from the wealthy monastic institutions and printing houses. As a result, the original Chöd texts and commentaries, often copied by hand, never enjoyed any wide circulation, and many have been lost forever."{{sfn|Edou|1996|p=7}}

[[Rangjung Dorje, 3rd Karmapa Lama]], (1284–1339) was an  important systematizer of Chöd teachings and significantly assisted in their promulgation within the literary and practice lineages of the Kagyu, Nyingma, and particularly Dzogchen.{{citation needed|date=September 2013|reason=Is Dzogchen not Nyingma?}} It is in this transition from the charnel grounds to the monastic institutions of Tibetan Buddhism that the rite of Chöd became an inner practice; the charnel ground became an internal imaginal environment. Schaeffer&lt;ref&gt;1995: p.15&lt;/ref&gt; conveys that the Third Karmapa was a systematizer of the Chöd developed by Machig Labdrön and lists a number of his works in Tibetan on Chöd. Amongst others, the works include redactions, outlines and commentaries.

{{quote|Rang byung was renowned as a systematizer of the Gcod teachings developed by Ma gcig lab sgron. His texts on Gcod include the ''Gcod kyi khrid yig''; the ''Gcod bka{{'}} tshoms chen mo{{'}}i sa bcad'' which consists of a topical outline of and commentary on Ma gcig lab sgron's  ''Shes rab kyi pha rol tu phyin pa zab mo gcod kyi man ngag gi gzhung bka{{'}} tshoms chen mo ''; the  ''Tshogs las yon tan kun {{'}}byung''; the lengthy ''Gcod kyi tshogs las rin po che{{'}}i phren ba {{'}}don bsgrigs bltas chog tu bdod pa gcod kyi lugs sor bzhag''; the ''Ma lab sgron la gsol ba {{'}}deb pa{{'}}i mgur ma''; the ''Zab mo bdud kyi gcod yil kyi khrid yig'', and finally the ''Gcod kyi nyams len''.{{sfn|Schaeffer|1995|p=15}}}}

==Western reports on Chöd practices==
Chöd was mostly practised outside the Tibetan monastery system by chödpas, who were ''[[yogi]]s'', ''[[yogini|yogiṇīs]]'' and ''[[ngagpa]]s'' rather than ''[[bhikkhu|bhikṣus]]'' and ''[[bhikkhuni|bhikṣuṇīs]]''. Because of this, material on Chöd has been less widely available to Western readers than some other tantric Buddhist practices. The first Western reports of Chöd came from a French adventurer who lived in Tibet, [[Alexandra David-Néel]] in her travelogue ''Magic and Mystery in Tibet,'' published in 1932. [[Walter Evans-Wentz]] published the first translation of a Chöd liturgy in his 1935 book ''Tibetan Yoga and Secret Doctrines''. Anila Rinchen Palmo translated several essays about Chöd in the 1987 collection ''Cutting Through Ego-Clinging: Commentary on the practice of Tchod''.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010|reason=believed translator not author}} Since then, Chöd has emerged more into the mainstream of both western scholarly and academic writings.

'''Conservation of Resources (COR) Theory'''  is a [[Psychological stress|stress]] theory that describes the motivation that drives humans to both maintain their current resources and to pursue new resources. &lt;ref name="Conservation of Resources. A new attempt at conceptualizing stress"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hobfoll|first1=Stevan|title=Conservation of Resources. A New attempt at conceptualizing stress|journal=The American Psychologist|date=1989|volume=44|issue=3|pages=513–524}}&lt;/ref&gt; This theory was proposed by Dr. Stevan E. Hobfoll in 1989 as a way to expand on the literature of stress as a [[construct (philosophy of science)|construct]].&lt;ref name="Conservation of Resources. A new attempt at conceptualizing stress"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hobfoll|first1=Stevan|title=Conservation of Resources. A New attempt at conceptualizing stress|journal=The American Psychologist|date=1989|volume=44|issue=3|pages=513–524}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

Hobfoll posited that [[psychological stress]] occurred in three instances; when there was a threat of a loss of resources, an actual net loss of resources, and a lack of gained resources following the spending of resources. From this perspective, resources are defined as things that one values, specifically objects, states, and conditions. &lt;ref name='Getting to the "COR"'&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Halbesleben|first1=J.B.|last2=Paustian-Underdal|first2=S.C.|last3=Westman|first3=M|title=Getting to the "COR": Understanding the Role of Resources in Conservation of Resources Theory|journal=Journal of Management|date=2014|volume=40|issue=5|pages=1334–1364|doi=10.1177/0149206314527130}}&lt;/ref&gt;  '''COR''' states that loss of these types of resources will drive individuals into certain levels of stress. &lt;ref name="Conservation of Resources. A new attempt at conceptualizing stress"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hobfoll|first1=Stevan|title=Conservation of Resources. A New attempt at conceptualizing stress|journal=The American Psychologist|date=1989|volume=44|issue=3|pages=513–524}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History of stress theory ==

'''COR''' was developed from various theories on the cause of stress.  '''COR''' development branches back to [[Walter Bradford Cannon]] (1932) who was one of the first researchers to study the concept of stress as it applies to humans, specifically in how stress can be withstood. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cannon|first1=Walter|title=The wisdom of the body|date=1932|publisher=W W Norton &amp; Co.|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Hans Selye]] (1950) took on Cannon’s research on stress as a response and indicated that stress itself was designed as a way to protect the body from environmental challenges. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Selye|first1=Hans|title=The physiology and pathology of exposure to stress|date=1950|publisher=Acta|location=Monteral}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Conservation of Resources. A new attempt at conceptualizing stress"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hobfoll|first1=Stevan|title=Conservation of Resources. A New attempt at conceptualizing stress|journal=The American Psychologist|date=1989|volume=44|issue=3|pages=513–524}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

Other researchers such as Elliot and Eisdorfer (1982) defined stress as specifically being the stimulus and not the response, which had been accepted by some of the scientific community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Elliott|first1=GR|last2=Eisdorfer|first2=C|title=Stress and human health|date=1982|publisher=Springer|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, this theory is largely based on the homeostatic model of stress developed by Joseph McGrath (1970). &lt;ref name="autogenerated1970"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=McGrath|first1=Joseph|title=A conceptual formulation for research on stress|journal=Social and Psychological Factors in Stress|date=1970|volume=10|issue=21}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is in this theory that stress is defined as an imbalance between the environmental demand and the response capability of an organism. &lt;ref name="autogenerated1970"/&gt;

== Basic principles of COR ==

COR covers two basic principles involving the protection of resources from being lost. &lt;ref name="Conservation of Resources. A new attempt at conceptualizing stress"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hobfoll|first1=Stevan|title=Conservation of Resources.

The second principle is known as '''Resource Investment.''' &lt;ref name='Getting to the "COR"'&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Halbesleben|first1=J.B.|last2=Paustian-Underdal|first2=S.C.|last3=Westman|first3=M|title=Getting to the "COR": Understanding the Role of Resources in Conservation of Resources Theory|journal=Journal of Management|date=2014|volume=40|issue=5|pages=1334–1364|doi=10.1177/0149206314527130}}&lt;/ref&gt; This principle of '''COR''' states that people will tend to invest resources in order to protect against resource loss, to recover from losses, and to gain resources.&lt;ref name='Getting to the "COR"'&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Halbesleben|first1=J.B.|last2=Paustian-Underdal|first2=S.C.|last3=Westman|first3=M|title=Getting to the "COR": Understanding the Role of Resources in Conservation of Resources Theory|journal=Journal of Management|date=2014|volume=40|issue=5|pages=1334–1364|doi=10.1177/0149206314527130}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within the context of coping, people will invest resources to prevent future resource losses.  

From these two principles, '''COR''' has suggested a number of corollaries that can be applied to resource changes. &lt;ref name="Conservation of Resources. A new attempt at conceptualizing stress"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hobfoll|first1=Stevan|title=Conservation of Resources. A New attempt at conceptualizing stress|journal=The American Psychologist|date=1989|volume=44|issue=3|pages=513–524}}&lt;/ref&gt;  They are as follows:

Similarly, individuals with fewer resources are more likely to experience resource losses. &lt;ref name="Conservation of Resources.

== Areas of research ==

'''COR''' has been utilized when studying work/family stress,&lt;ref name="The Conservation of Resources Model applied to work-family conflict and strain"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Grandey|first1=A|last2=Cropanzano|first2=R|title=The Conservation of Resources model applied to work-family conflict and strain|journal=Journal of Vocational Behavior|date=1999|volume=54|issue=2|pages=350–370|doi=10.1006/jvbe.1998.1666}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="A conservation of  resources view of the relationship between work engagement and work interference with family"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Halbesleben|first1=J.R.|last2=Harvey|first2=J.|last3=Bolino|first3=M.C.|title=A conservation of  resources view of the relationship between work engagement and work interference with family|journal=Journal of Applied Psychology|date=2009|volume=94|issue=6|page=1452}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Occupational burnout|burnout]],&lt;ref name="Sources of social support and burnout"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Halbesleben|first1=J.R.|title=Sources of support and burnout: a meta analytic test of the conservation of resources model|journal=Journal of Applied Psychology|date=2006|volume=91|issue=5|page=1134}}&lt;/ref&gt; and general stress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hobfoll|first1=Stevan|title=Conservation of resources theory: Its implication for stress, health, and resilience|journal=The Oxford Handbook of Stress, Health, and Coping|pages=127–147}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In work/family stress, '''COR''' research has looked at how the distribution of one’s resources have affected their home life, with some articles finding that putting too much of one’s resources into one’s work may lead to family problems at home.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gandey|first1=Alicia|last2=Cropanzano|first2=Russell|title=The conservation of resources model applied to work-family conflict and strain|journal=Journal of Vocational Behavior|date=1999|volume=54|issue=2|pages=350–370}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Research into '''COR''' and burnout has examined how the use of resources has impacted one’s mood, with recent research finding that emotional exhaustion had the strongest relationship with depressive symptoms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Neveu|first1=Jean-Pierre|title=Jailed resources: Conservation of resources theory as applied to burnout among prison guards|journal=Journal of Organizational Behavior|date=2007|volume=28|issue=1|pages=21–42}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

In regards to general stress, research has explored how the loss of resources impacts the levels of one’s stress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hobfoll|first1=Stevan|title=The Influence of culture, community, and the nested-self in the stress process: Advancing conservation of resources theory|journal=Applied Psychology|date=2001|volume=50|issue=2|pages=337–421}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It should be noted that COR has primarily been studied within the burnout and job fields, as the following meta-analyses will demonstrate.  There is currently no meta-analyses on COR within other areas of stress research.  

Multiple meta-analyses have been conducted with COR, specifically related to burnout. One meta-analyses by Lee and Ashforth (1996) examined the relationship between demand and resource correlates, behavioral and attitudinal correlate, and 3 different dimensions of job burnout. &lt;ref name="autogenerated123"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lee|first1=R.T.|last2=Ashforth|first2=B.E.|title=A meta-analytic examination of the correlates of the three dimensions of job burnout|journal=Journal of Applied Psychology|date=1996|volume=81|issue=2|pages=123–133|doi=10.1037/0021-9010.81.2.123}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It used COR as the basis for this research and found that the primacy of resource loss principle is supported.  It found that, over 58 sources, individuals tend to be sensitive to increased demands rather than resources received.  &lt;ref name="autogenerated123"/&gt;   

Job control and COR have been studied through a meta-analyses conducted by Park, Baiden, Jacob, &amp; Wagner (2009). &lt;ref name="autogenerated2"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Park|first1=Hyung|last2=Baiden|first2=Mavis|last3=Jacob|first3=Annalyn C.|last4=Wagner|first4=Stephen H.|title=Job Control and Burnout: A Meta-Analytic Test of the Conservation of Resources Model|journal=Academy of Management Annual Meeting Proceedings|date=2009|volume=1|pages=1–6|doi=10.5465/AMBPP.2009.44244567}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This study tested COR using all constructs involved in job control and burnout which included constructs of autonomy, authority, skill discretion, and decision latitude. &lt;ref name="autogenerated2"/&gt; Results indicate that the construct of job control, or the ability that one has to choose their actions from multiple options at their job, is related to depersonalization and personal accomplishment.  This study stated that COR is related to burnout in this way, but further studies should be conducted that use non-human service occupations.  &lt;ref name="autogenerated2"/&gt;

'''Continuum''' theories or models explain variation as involving gradual [[level of measurement|quantitative]] transitions without abrupt changes or discontinuities. In contrast, categorical theories or models explain variation using [[qualitative property|qualitatively]] different states.&lt;ref&gt;

== In physics ==
In physics, for example, the [[Spacetime|space-time continuum model]] describes space and time as part of the same continuum rather than as separate entities. A [[spectrum]] in physics, such as the [[electromagnetic spectrum]], is often termed as either continuous (with energy at all wavelengths) or discrete (energy at only certain wavelengths).

In contrast, [[quantum mechanics]] uses [[Quantum|quanta]], certain defined amounts (i.e. categorical amounts) which are distinguished from continuous amounts.

== In mathematics and philosophy ==
A good introduction to the philosophical issues involved is [[John Lane Bell]]'s [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/continuity/ essay] in the [http://plato.stanford.edu/ ''Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy''].  A significant divide is provided by the [[law of excluded middle]].  It determines the divide between [[Intuitionism|intuitionistic]] continua such as [[Luitzen Egbertus Jan Brouwer|Brouwer]]'s and [[Lawvere]]'s, and classical ones such as [[Simon Stevin|Stevin]]'s and [[Abraham Robinson|Robinson]]'s.  
Bell isolates two distinct historical conceptions of [[infinitesimal]], one by [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]] and one by [[Nieuwentijdt]], and argues that Leibniz's conception was implemented in Robinson's [[hyperreal number|hyperreal]] continuum, whereas Nieuwentijdt's, in Lawvere's [[smooth infinitesimal analysis]], characterized by the presence of nilsquare infinitesimals: "It may be said that Leibniz recognized the need for the first, but not the second type of infinitesimal and Nieuwentijdt, vice versa. It is of interest to note that Leibnizian infinitesimals (differentials) are realized in [[nonstandard analysis]], and nilsquare infinitesimals in [[smooth infinitesimal analysis]]".

== In social sciences (in general), psychology and psychiatry ==
In [[social science]]s in general, psychology and psychiatry included, data about differences between individuals, like any data, can be collected and measured using different [[levels of measurement]]. Those levels include dichotomous (a person either has a personality trait or not) and non-dichotomous approaches. While the non-dichotomous approach allows for understanding that everyone lies somewhere on a particular personality dimension, the dichotomous (nominal categorical and ordinal) approaches only seek to confirm that a particular person either has or does not have a particular mental disorder.

Expert witnesses particularly are trained to help courts in translating the data into the legal (e.g. 'guilty' vs. 'innocent') dichotomy, which apply to [[law]], [[sociology]] and [[ethics]].

== Linguistics ==
In [[linguistics]], the range of [[dialect]]s spoken over a geographical area that differ slightly between neighboring areas is known as a [[dialect continuum]]. A language continuum is a similar description for the merging of neighboring languages without a clear defined boundary. Examples of dialect or language continuums include the varieties of Italian or German; and the [[Romance languages]], [[Arabic languages]], or [[Bantu languages]].

'''Deep time''' is the concept of [[Geologic time scale|geologic time]]. The modern philosophical concept was developed in the 18th century by [[Scottish people|Scottish]] geologist [[James Hutton]] (1726–1797).{{sfn|Palmer|Zen}}{{sfn|Kubicek|2008}} The [[age of the Earth]] has been determined to be, after a long and complex history of developments, around 4.55&amp;nbsp;billion years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/how-science-figured-out-the-age-of-the-earth/|title=How Science Figured Out the Age of Earth|last=Braterman|first=Paul S.|website=Scientific American|access-date=2016-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scientific concept==
{{Life timeline}}
Hutton based his view of deep time on a form of geochemistry that had developed in Scotland and Scandinavia from the 1750s onward.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last = Eddy |first = Matthew Daniel |title = The Language of Mineralogy: John Walker, Chemistry and the Edinburgh Medical School 1750-1800 |date = 2008 |publisher = [[Ashgate]] |location = London |page = Ch. 5 |url = https://www.academia.edu/1112014/The_Language_of_Mineralogy_John_Walker_Chemistry_and_the_Edinburgh_Medical_School_1750-1800_2008_}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As [[mathematician]] [[John Playfair]], one of Hutton's friends and colleagues in the [[Scottish Enlightenment]], remarked upon seeing the [[stratum|strata]] of the [[Unconformity|angular unconformity]] at [[Siccar Point]] with Hutton and [[Sir James Hall, 4th Baronet|James Hall]] in June 1788, "the mind seemed to grow giddy by looking so far into the abyss of time".{{sfn|Playfair|1805}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= McPhee |first= John |date= 1981 |title= Book 1: Basin and Range, in [[Annals of the Former World]] |url= |location= New York |publisher= [[Farrar, Straus and Giroux]] |page= 79 |isbn= 0-374-10520-0 |author-link= John McPhee }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Early [[geologists]] such as [[Nicolas Steno]] (1638-1686) and [[Horace-Bénédict de Saussure]] (1740-1799) had developed ideas of [[Stratum|geological strata]] forming from water through chemical processes, which [[Abraham Gottlob Werner]] (1749–1817) developed into a theory known as [[Neptunism]], envisaging the slow crystallisation of minerals in the ancient oceans of the Earth to form [[rock (geology)|rock]].  Hutton's innovative 1785 theory, based on [[Plutonism]], visualised an endless cyclical process of rocks forming under the sea, being uplifted and tilted, then eroded to form new strata under the sea. In 1788 the sight of [[Hutton's Unconformity]] at Siccar Point convinced Playfair and Hall of this extremely slow cycle, and in that same year Hutton memorably wrote "we find no vestige of a beginning, no prospect of an end".{{sfn|Montgomery|2003}}{{sfn|Rance|1999}}

Other scientists such as [[Georges Cuvier]] (1769-1832) put forward ideas of past ages, and geologists such as [[Adam Sedgwick]] (1785-1873) incorporated Werner's ideas into concepts of [[catastrophism]]; Sedgwick inspired his university student [[Charles Darwin]] to exclaim "What a capital hand is Sedgewick [sic] for drawing large cheques upon the Bank of Time!".{{sfn|Darwin|1831}}  In a competing theory, [[Charles Lyell]] in his ''Principles of Geology'' (1830–1833) developed Hutton's comprehension of endless deep time as a crucial [[Science|scientific]] concept  into [[uniformitarianism]].  As a young [[Natural history|naturalist]] and geological theorist, Darwin studied the successive volumes of Lyell's book exhaustively during the [[Second voyage of HMS Beagle|''Beagle'' survey voyage]] in the 1830s, before beginning to theorise about [[evolution]].

[[Physicist]] [[Gregory Benford]] addresses the concept in ''Deep Time: How Humanity Communicates Across Millennia'' (1999), as does [[Paleontology|paleontologist]] and ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' editor [[Henry Gee]] in ''In Search of Deep Time:  Beyond the Fossil Record to a New History of Life'' (2001){{sfn|Korthof|2000}}{{sfn|Campbell|2001}}  [[Stephen Jay Gould]]'s ''[[Time's Arrow, Time's Cycle]]'' (1987) also deals in large part with the evolution of the concept.

[[John McPhee]] discussed "deep time" at length with the layperson in mind in ''Basin and Range'' (1981), parts of which originally appeared in the ''[[The New Yorker|New Yorker]]'' magazine.{{sfn|McPhee|1998|p=77}} In ''Time's Arrow, Time's Cycle'', Gould cited one of the metaphors McPhee used in explaining the concept of deep time:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Consider the Earth's history as the old measure of the English yard, the distance from the King's nose to the tip of his outstretched hand. One stroke of a nail file on his middle finger erases human history.{{sfn|McPhee|1998|p=77}}
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Concepts similar to geologic time were recognized in the 11th century by the [[Islamic geography|Persian geologist]] and [[polymath]] [[Avicenna]] (Ibn Sina, 973–1037),{{sfn|Toulmin|Goodfield|1965|p=64}} and by the [[History of science and technology in China|Chinese naturalist]] and polymath [[Shen Kuo]] (1031–1095).{{sfn|Sivin|1995|pp=iii,23-24}}

The [[Roman Catholic]] [[theologian]] [[Thomas Berry]] (1914–2009) explored [[spirituality|spiritual]] implications of the concept of deep time.  Berry proposes that a deep understanding of the history and functioning of the evolving universe is a necessary inspiration and guide for our own effective functioning as individuals and as a species. This view has greatly influenced the development of [[deep ecology]] and [[ecophilosophy]]. The experiential nature of the experience of deep time has also greatly influenced the work of [[Joanna Macy]] and [[John Seed]].

[[H.G. Wells]] and [[Julian Huxley]] regarded the difficulties of coping with the concept of deep time as exaggerated:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"The use of different scales is simply a matter of practice", they said in ''[[The Science of Life]]'' (1929).  "We very soon get used to maps, though they are constructed on scales down to a hundred-millionth of natural size. .&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp; to grasp geological time all that is needed is to stick tight to some magnitude which shall be the unit on the new and magnified scale—a million years is probably the most convenient—to grasp its meaning once and for all by an effort of imagination, and then to think of all passage of geological time in terms of this unit."&lt;ref&gt;
H.G. Wells, Julian S. Huxley, and G.P. Wells, ''The Science of Life'' (New York: The Literary Guild, 1934; orig. publ. 1929), p. 326.

''' Divya-drishti ''' ([[Hindi]]: दिव्य दृष्टि) or the divine eye-sight, also known as ''Yoga-drishti'', refers to 'divine perception' which is intuitive perception or cognition that carries with it an intrinsic certainty and conviction. It is a spiritual attainment which according to [[Patanjali]] enables the '' [[yogi]] '' to communicate with heavenly bodies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Textbook of Scientific Hindu Astrology|author=P.

In the [[Bhagavad Gita]], [[Krishna]] tells [[Arjuna]]:-

: न तु मां शक्यसे द्रष्टुमनेनैव स्वचक्षुषा |
: दिव्यं ददामि ते चक्षुः पश्य मे योगमैश्वरम् || 

: " But surely you cannot see Me with these human eyes of yours; therefore; I vouchsafe to you the divine eye. With this you behold My divine power of Yoga. "  - ([[Bhagavad Gita]] XI.8)

Krishna invited Arjuna to observe the Cosmic Body or [[Viraj]]) and behold as concentrated within that body (in the person of Krishna) the entire creation and all that is desired to be seen. When Arjuna failed to see that divine form, Krishna bestowed the gift of divine vision – दिव्यं चक्षुः. Thus endowed, Arjuna saw an undisguised reality he could otherwise not see, what he then saw was अद्भुतदर्शनम् (many a wonderful sight) divine in essence, transcendent and all-effulgent, the sight which has never been seen before. Arjuna saw the power of creating diversity in the universe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Yoga of Devotion|author=GK Marballi|publisher=Lulu|page=139|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2_LwBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA139&amp;dq=divya-drishti&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=6rztVOf4AoHjuQTv9oHgBw&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=divya-drishti&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt; A similar gift had been bestowed on [[Sanjaya]] by Sage [[Vyasa]]. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Srimadbhagavadgita Tattvavivecani|author=Jayadayal Goyandka|publisher=Gita Press|pages=488-490|url= https://books.google.com/books/about/Srimadbhagavadgita.html?id=NFWHMwEACAAJ&amp;redir_esc=y }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The [[Vedic|Vedic seers]] have spoken about the wondrous eyes of Lord [[Vishnu]], the ever-open watchful divine eyes whose power of sight is not restricted by space and time. Rishi Medhātithih Kānvah states that:-

: तद्विष्णोः परमं पदं सदा पश्यन्ति सूरयः |
: दिवीव चक्षुराततम् || - ([[Rig Veda]] I.xxii.20)

: " the learned practitioners of Dharma do, in the brightness of the (all-revealing) sun, (clearly) see the wide spread eyes of the Lord, the mighty all-surveying Sole Witness, and in the process with the aid of knowledge also see Him at all times ensconced as the atman.

'''Edward René David Goldsmith''' (8 November 1928&amp;nbsp;– 21 August 2009), widely known as '''Teddy Goldsmith''', was an Anglo-French [[environmentalist]], [[writer]] and [[philosopher]].

He was a member the prominent [[Goldsmith family]]. The eldest son of Major [[Frank Goldsmith]], and elder brother of the financier [[James Goldsmith]]. Edward Goldsmith was the founding editor and publisher of ''[[The Ecologist]]''. Known for his outspoken views opposing industrial society and economic development, he expressed a strong sympathy for the ways and values of [[indigenous peoples|traditional peoples]].

He co-authored the influential ''[[A Blueprint for Survival]]'' with [[Robert Prescott-Allen|Robert Allen]], becoming a founding member of the political party "People" (later renamed the [[Green Party of England and Wales|Green Party]]), itself largely inspired by the'' Blueprint''. Goldsmith's conservative view of environmentalism put him at odds with the socialist currents of thought, which came to dominate the Green Party.

A [[deep ecologist]] and [[systems theorist]], Goldsmith was an early proponent of the [[Gaia hypothesis]], having previously developed a similar [[cybernetic]] concept of a self-regulating [[biosphere]].

A talented [[public speaking|after-dinner speaker]] and raconteur, Goldsmith was an articulate spokesman and campaigner,&lt;ref name="Guardian"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2009/aug/27/obituary-edward-goldsmith |title=The Guardian Obituary: Edward Goldsmith |publisher=Guardian |accessdate=19 September 2009 | location=London | first=Walter | last=Schwarz | date=27 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; receiving a number of awards for his work protecting the natural world and highlighting the importance and plight of [[indigenous peoples]], including an honorary [[Right Livelihood Award]] and the [[Chevalier de la Legion d'Honneur]].

== Early life ==
Goldsmith (widely known as Teddy) was born in Paris in 1928 to a German Jewish father, [[Frank Goldsmith]], and French mother, Marcelle Mouiller.&lt;ref name="CV"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.edwardgoldsmith.com/page2.html |title=curriculum vitae |publisher=Edward Goldsmith |date= |accessdate=19 September 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090822022558/http://www.edwardgoldsmith.com/page2.html |archivedate=22 August 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

He entered [[Millfield School]], [[Somerset]], as a grammar student, and he later graduated with honours in Philosophy, Politics, and Economics at [[Magdalen College, Oxford]] (1947–1950).&lt;ref name="CV"/&gt; While studying at Oxford, Goldsmith rejected the reductionist and compartmentalised ideas taught at the time, and he sought a more holistic worldview with which to study societies and the problems facing the world at large.&lt;ref name="Kingsnorth"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.edwardgoldsmith.com/page288.html |title=The Godfather of Green by Paul Kingsnorth |publisher=Edwardgoldsmith.com |date= |accessdate=19 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After fulfilling his [[National Service]] as a British Intelligence Officer in [[Hamburg]] and [[Berlin]], he involved himself unsuccessfully in a number of business ventures and devoted most of his spare time to the study of the subjects that were to preoccupy him for the rest of his life.&lt;ref name="CV"/&gt;

Throughout the 1960s, he spent time travelling the world with his close friend, [[John Aspinall (zoo owner)|John Aspinall]], witnessing at first hand the destruction of traditional societies. He concluded that the spread of [[economic development]] and its accompanying industrialisation, [[Postdevelopment Theory|far from being progressive]] as claimed, was actually the root cause of social and environmental destruction.&lt;ref name="Kingsnorth"/&gt;&lt;ref name="VeldmanFirst"&gt;Fantasy, the Bomb, and the Greening of Britain by Meredith Veldman. Cambridge University Press, 1994. pp.28-9&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Pearce"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.edwardgoldsmith.com/page279.html |title=Uncle Teddy by Fred Pearce, 1991 |publisher=Edwardgoldsmith.com |date=10 January 1991 |accessdate=19 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Work ==

=== Primitive People's Fund ===
{{main article|Survival International}}
In London, at meetings of the Primitive People's Fund (the committee that founded [[Survival International]]), Goldsmith teamed up with the fund's treasurer [[Robert Prescott-Allen]], the explorer [[Jean Liedloff]], and a writer from ''World Medicine'', [[Peter Bunyard]], to found ''The Ecologist'' in 1969.&lt;ref name="Kingsnorth"/&gt;&lt;ref name="VeldmanFirst"/&gt;

=== "Theory of a Unified Science" ===
After rejecting what he saw as the excessively reductionist and compartmentalised approach of mainstream academia, he spent much of his time researching and developing his own theories for the unification of the sciences.&lt;ref&gt;The Stable Society by Edward Goldsmith. The Wadebridge Press, 1978. p iv&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Theory of a Unified Science'' was heavily influenced by cybernetics, as well as the [[General Systems Theory]] of [[Ludwig von Bertalanffy]], the [[holism]] of the early academic ecologists, and the [[Structural functionalism|functionalism]] employed by many anthropologists.&lt;ref name="WayIntro"&gt;The Way: an ecological worldview by Edward Goldsmith, University of Georgia Press, 1998. Introduction&lt;/ref&gt; His theory would later be published, in its final form, as ''The Way: an ecological world view.'' ([[#The Way|see below]])

Early on, Goldsmith had formulated a concept of the biosphere as an integrated cybernetic entity, the self-regulating parts (of which he included tribal societies) co-operating, largely unconsciously, for the mutual benefit of the whole,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theecologist.info/key27.html |title=A Blueprint for Survival, The Ecologist Vol. 2, No. 1. Appendix A |publisher=Theecologist.info |date=14 September 1972 |accessdate=19 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; a view that anticipated aspects of the Gaia thesis,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theecologist.org/blogs_and_comments/commentators/other_comments/312409/teddy_goldsmith_a_tribute.html |title=Teddy Goldsmith: a tribute by Peter Bunyard. '&amp;#39;The Ecologist Online'&amp;#39;, 1st September, 2009 |publisher=Theecologist.org |date= |accessdate=19 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; of which he was to become a leading proponent.&lt;ref&gt;Gaia, the Thesis, the Mechanisms and the Implications, edited by Peter Bunyard and Edward Goldsmith. Wadebridge Ecological Centre, 1988.&lt;/ref&gt;

Goldsmith was also a critic of [[neo-Darwinism]]. He claimed that it is a [[reductionist]] theory and that if you understand [[evolution]], it is necessary to "abandon the reductionistic and mechanistic paradigm of science".&lt;ref&gt;The Ecologist Vol. 20 No. 2, March–April 1990 [http://www.edwardgoldsmith.org/890/evolution-neo-darwinism-and-the-paradigm-of-science/ Online]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''The Ecologist'' ===
{{main article|The Ecologist}}
Having established ''The Ecologist'' in 1969 with founding editors Robert Allen, [[Jean Liedloff]], and Peter Bunyard,&lt;ref name="VeldmanFirst"/&gt; Goldsmith was to use the journal as a platform for his theoretical concerns with regular articles appearing under the heading "Towards a Unified Science". The journal also became an important forum for the early [[green movement]], with articles focusing on the relevance and survival of hunter-gatherer societies, alternative technology and organic farming, together with prescient articles about climate change,&lt;ref&gt;The Ecologist Vol. 1 No. 1&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Ecologist Vol. 2 No. 1&lt;/ref&gt; resource depletion,&lt;ref&gt;Can Britain Survive? Edited by Edward Goldsmith. Tom Stacey, 1971&lt;/ref&gt; and nuclear accidents. They were accompanied by the usual gamut of articles examining pollution, overpopulation, deforestation, soil erosion, corporate power, large dams, and, not least, the [[World Bank]]'s alleged role in "financing the destruction of our planet".&lt;ref name="CV"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Ecologist Vol.1, Nos 1–18.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''A Blueprint For Survival'' ===
{{main article|A Blueprint for Survival}}
Signed by over thirty of the leading scientists of the day—l, including Sir [[Julian Huxley]], Sir [[Frank Fraser Darling]], Sir [[Peter Medawar]], Sir [[Peter Scott]], and [[C. H. Waddington]], Goldsmith and his fellow editor Robert Allen made headlines in January 1972 with ''A Blueprint for Survival''.

The ''Blueprint'' was a far reaching proposal for a radical [[Transition Towns|transition]] to a largely decentralised and deindustrialised society, an attempt to prevent what the authors referred to as " the breakdown of society and the irreversible disruption of the life-support systems on this planet".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theecologist.info/page34.html |title=A Blueprint for Survival, The Ecologist Vol. 2, No. 1. Preface |publisher=Theecologist.info |date=14 September 1972 |accessdate=19 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; It became a key text for the early Green movement, selling over half a million copies, and it was translated into 16 different languages.&lt;ref name="Rev"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://video.google.co.uk/videoplay?docid=3351185323669993067 |title=Edward Goldsmith—the Green Revolutionary. Goldhawk Films, 1990 |publisher=Video.google.co.uk |date= |accessdate=19 September 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080331100129/http://video.google.co.uk/videoplay?docid=3351185323669993067 |archivedate=31 March 2008 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In many ways, it anticipated the concerns taken up by today's [[Transition Towns|Transition Movement]].

Goldsmith and Allen argued that rather than devise imaginary [[utopia]]s, as did Marxist and liberal political theorists of the time, they should instead look to the example of existing [[Indigenous peoples|tribal peoples]], who, the authors claimed, were real-life working models of societies perfectly adapted to both their long-term survival needs and the needs of the living world on which they depended. The tribal peoples alone, the authors argued, had demonstrated a viable means by which the most pressing problems facing humanity could be answered successfully.&lt;ref name="Kingsnorth"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fantasy, the Bomb, and the Greening of Britain by Meredith Veldman. Cambridge University Press, 1994. p229-30&lt;/ref&gt;

Such societies were characterised by their small, human-scale communities, low-impact technologies, successful population controls, sustainable resource management, holistic and ecologically integrated worldviews and a high degree of social cohesion, physical health, psychological well-being and spiritual fulfilment of their members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theecologist.info/key27.html |title=A Blueprint for Survival, The Ecologist Vol. 2, No. 1 |publisher=Theecologist.info |date=14 September 1972 |accessdate=19 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Stable Society by Edward Goldsmith. The Wadebridge Press, 1978.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Way: an ecological worldview by Edward Goldsmith, University of Georgia Press, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The People Party ===
{{main article|History of the Green Party of England and Wales}}
The ''Blueprint'' was a major inspiration for the embryonic political party called "People" (later to become the [[Green Party of England and Wales|Green Party]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://another-green-world.blogspot.com/2006/10/short-history-of-green-party-of.html |title=A short history of the Green Party of England and Wales by Derek Wall, 1993 |publisher=Another-green-world.blogspot.com |date=9 October 2006 |accessdate=19 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;) which invited Goldsmith to stand for the [[Eye (UK Parliament constituency)|Eye]] constituency in Suffolk as their candidate in the [[United Kingdom general election, February 1974|February 1974 general election]].

The campaign focused on the threat of desertification from the intensive farming practised in the area, which Goldsmith emphasised with the help of a [[Bactrian camel]] supplied by Aspinall. Goldsmith was in turn accompanied by bearded supporters dressed in the garb of Arab sheiks, the implication being that if modern oil-intensive farming practises were allowed to continue, the camel would be the only viable means of transport left in [[Suffolk]]. Goldsmith lost his [[Deposit (politics)|deposit]], but his unorthodox campaign succeeded in attracting the media's attention and highlighted the issues.&lt;ref name="Kingsnorth"/&gt; He again stood for the now-renamed Ecology Party at the [[European Parliament election, 1979 (United Kingdom)|European elections in 1979]], now winning a more respectable portion of [[Cornwall and Plymouth (European Parliament constituency)#Results|the vote]].&lt;ref name="CV"/&gt;

=== Cornwall ===
In 1973, buoyed by the success of the ''Blueprint'' and a sudden rise in public awareness of ecological issues, partly brought about by the [[Stockholm Conference]] and the publication of the [[Club of Rome]]'s ''[[The Limits to Growth]]'' in the same year. Goldsmith and his editorial team moved from their offices in London to relocate to rural Cornwall, in the far west of England.&lt;ref&gt;Fantasy, the Bomb, and the Greening of Britain by Meredith Veldman. Cambridge University Press, 1994. p239&lt;/ref&gt; Goldsmith and his colleagues bought themselves farms, and for the following 17 years, they attempted to form a small-scale, relatively self-sufficient community of their own, and ''The Ecologist'' continued to be produced on-site, in between their other chores.&lt;ref name="Kingsnorth"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Telegraph"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/politics-obituaries/6089129/Teddy-Goldsmith.html |title=The Daily Telegraph Obituary: Edward Goldsmith |publisher=Telegraph.co.uk |date=25 August 2009 |accessdate=19 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1977, when the Central Electricity Generating Board (CEGB) threatened to site a nuclear reactor on farmland in [[Luxulyan]], Cornwall, Goldsmith was among those who organised a continuous [[sit-in]] of the land, with local people blocking the entrance and staffing round-the-clock garrisons to prevent CEGB contractors from starting their drilling work.&lt;ref name="CV"/&gt; An early example of an environmental [[protest camp]], the [[High Court of Justice|High Court]] of England and Wales eventually awarded in favour of CEGB allowing the drilling to go ahead. The CEGB never went on to develop the site, however.

=== The Gandhi Peace Foundation ===
In 1974, Goldsmith spent four months with the [[Gandhi Peace Foundation]] in [[New Delhi]], comparing the [[Gandhi]]an (''[[Sarvodaya]]'') movement with the Ecology movement in Europe.&lt;ref name="CV"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Rev"/&gt; This led Goldsmith to forge close links with Indian environmental activists, in particular with the [[Chipko]] movement, including [[Sunderlal Bahuguna]] and [[Vandana Shiva]]. That was to have a major influence on Goldsmith's approach to environmental activism and led to a [http://exacteditions.theecologist.org/exact/browse/307/308/5714/1/1/0/gandhi special issue of ''The Ecologist''] on the subject.&lt;ref name="Rev"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Ecologist Vol. 5 No. 8&lt;/ref&gt;

=== World Bank ===
In 1984, together with his colleague [[Nicholas Hildyard]], Goldsmith authored a multi-volume report on the destructive effects of large-scale, hydroelectric dams. It was the beginning of a long attack against the [[International Monetary Fund]] and [[ World Bank]], which Goldsmith and his colleagues accused of financing the destruction of the planet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.edwardgoldsmith.com/key41.html |title=The Social and Environmental Effects of Large Dams by Edward Goldsmith and Nicholas Hildyard. Wadebridge Ecological Centre, 1984 |publisher=Edwardgoldsmith.com |date= |accessdate=19 September 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090830130051/http://www.edwardgoldsmith.com/key41.html |archivedate=30 August 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In one episode, Goldsmith wrote an [https://web.archive.org/web/20100103211422/http://www.edwardgoldsmith.com/page101.html open letter] to the then President of the World Bank, [[Alden W. Clausen]], demanding that the bank "stop financing the destruction of the tropical world, the devastation of its remaining forests, the extermination of its wildlife and the impoverishment and starvation of its human inhabitants".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/obituaries/article6809722.ece |title=The Times Obituary: Edward Goldsmith |publisher=Timesonline.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2016-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time, the connection between large-scale development projects and social and environmental destruction had not been widely recognised, even within the environmental movement.

=== Forests campaign ===
In 1989, Goldsmith helped to organise an international campaign calling for an immediate end to the [[deforestation|destruction of the world's remaining forests]] with its [[ethnocide|detrimental effects on indigenous cultures]], [[Biodiversity threats|biodiversity]] and [[global warming|global climate]]. The campaign raised over 3 million signatures, which were taken in wheelbarrows to the UN's headquarters in New York City. Goldsmith and a party of activists subsequently occupied the main lobby, refusing to move until the Secretary General, [[Perez de Cuellar]], agreed to see them. The group demanded for him to call an extraordinary general meeting of the [[United Nations Security Council|Security Council]] to tackle the global crisis of [[deforestation]].&lt;ref name="Rev"/&gt; Although failing, the campaign managed to organise a meeting in the [[US Senate]] with a group of senators, headed by [[Al Gore]], whom the activists called upon to end their support of the World Bank.&lt;ref name="CV"/&gt;

=== The Goldsmith Foundation ===
In 1991, with the financial support of his brother James, Goldsmith established the Goldsmith (JMG) Foundation supporting a diverse range of non-governmental organisations campaigning against environmentally destructive activities, along with organisations providing sustainable alternatives.&lt;ref name="CV"/&gt;

=== The Way ===
In 1990, urged on by [[Arne Næss]],&lt;ref name="WayIntro"/&gt; Goldsmith left the editorship of ''The Ecologist'' to Nicholas Hildyard, while taking time off to write his philosophical magnum opus ''The Way: an ecological worldview''.&lt;ref name="Harding"&gt;"The Ecologist Magazine 1970–2007: a case study" Master's thesis Kristen Harding. University of Plymouth, September 2007&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Way'' (1992) was the culmination and synthesis of more than four decades of theoretical development,&lt;ref name="WayIntro"/&gt; embodying a "coherent worldview" by which Goldsmith would attempt to explain the self-inflicted problems facing the world and to propose a way out of them. Much of the work was already mature in Goldsmith's mind by the time that he published the first issues of ''The Ecologist'' in 1970.&lt;ref&gt;Towards a Unified Science. The Ecologist Vol.1, Vol.2, Vol. 3&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theecologist.info/key27.html |title=A Blueprint for Survival, The Ecologist Vol. 2, No. 1.

=== Later life ===
In addition to the UK ''Ecologist'', Goldsmith later helped to found and support ''The Ecologist'' as independent enterprises in many parts of the world:

: ''Brazil'' (in Portuguese); ''France'' (in French); ''Asia'' (India); ''Italy'' (in Italian); ''Greece'' (in Greek); ''The Pacific'' (New Zealand); ''Lebanon'' (in Arabic); ''Latin America'' (in Spanish); and ''Colombia'' (in Spanish).&lt;ref name="CV"/&gt;

He continued to attend key meetings around the world&lt;ref name="CV"/&gt; and involved himself with a variety of campaign organisations by becoming President of the ''Climate Initiatives Fund'', Richmond, London;&lt;ref name="CV"/&gt; a board member of the ''[[International Forum on Globalization]]'', San Francisco, USA;&lt;ref name="CV"/&gt; a founder member of ''Marunui Conservation Ltd.'', [[Mangawhai]], New Zealand (1987);&lt;ref name="CV"/&gt; and a founder member and vice-president of [[ECOROPA]], a European ecological club and think tank (1975).&lt;ref name="CV"/&gt;

== Controversies ==
In 1997, after an acrimonious split with his editorial team, most notably with his former friend and colleague Nicholas Hildyard,&lt;ref name="Harding"/&gt; Goldsmith was left to run ''The Ecologist'' on his own. Having been absent for some years, he brought in the [[International Society for Ecology and Culture]] (ISEC) to act as the editorial team. His nephew [[Zac Goldsmith|Zac]], who was then working for ISEC, eventually took over the editorship on their behalf.&lt;ref name="Harding"/&gt;

The split with Hildyard led to a period of often-bitter criticism from some members of the political left in the environmental movement,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hildyard |first=Nicholas |url=http://www.thecornerhouse.org.uk/item.shtml?x=51967 |title="Blood" and "Culture" by Nicholas Hildyard |publisher=Thecornerhouse.org.uk |date= |accessdate=19 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Monbiot"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.monbiot.com/archives/2002/04/30/black-shirts-in-green-trousers/ |title=Black Shirts in Green Trousers by George Monbiot |publisher=Monbiot.com |date=30 April 2002 |accessdate=19 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Answer"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.edwardgoldsmith.com/page3.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-08-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091215053128/http://www.edwardgoldsmith.com/page3.html |archivedate=15 December 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; which, compounded with failing health,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://property.timesonline.co.uk/tol/life_and_style/property/gardens/article5623863.ece |title=The ecogardeners from Tuscany by Caroline Donald |publisher=Property.timesonline.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2016-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; resulted in a period of isolation from the British scene.

Goldsmith was accused of having affiliated himself with the [[Nouvelle Droite]], an intellectual voice of the European "New Right",{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}} after addressing a symposium on Green issues organised in Paris by the GRECE (Research and Study Group on European Culture),&lt;ref&gt;"Eléments pour la Civilisation Européenne", quarterly issue 81, p. 51. November 1994, Paris&lt;/ref&gt; a school of political thought founded largely on the works of [[Alain de Benoist]].&lt;ref&gt;"Actes des Colloques nationaux du GRECE (with Alain de Benoist) including: ''États-unis: danger'', Paris, December 1992: ''Les Enjeux de l'Ecologie'' (The Challenges of Ecology), Paris, November 1994&lt;/ref&gt; It was the attending of that and another similar event&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.edwardgoldsmith.com/page285.html |title="Cooking up rightwing connections", '&amp;#39;The Guardian'&amp;#39;, 18 July 2000 |publisher=Edwardgoldsmith.com |date= |accessdate=19 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; that had led to rising tensions with his colleague Nicholas Hildyard.&lt;ref name="Harding"/&gt; The title of Goldsmith's contribution in Paris being simply "Une société écologique: la seule alternative" (''An Ecological Society: The Only Alternative'').&lt;ref&gt;"Actes du XXVIIIème colloque national du GRECE: "''Gauche-Droite: la Fin d'un Systeme''", Paris. Published in December 1995&lt;/ref&gt;

Later, in a controversial article for the ''Guardian'' newspaper, entitled "Black Shirts in Green Trousers", [[George Monbiot]] (a cofounder of the left-wing political party [[Respect – The Unity Coalition|Respect]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2004/feb/17/iraq.iraq1 |title=Monbiot quits Respect over threat to Greens |work=The Guardian |accessdate=19 September 2009 | location=London | first=Matthew | last=Tempest | date=18 February 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;) accused Goldsmith of having "advocated the enforced separation of Tutsis and Hutus in Rwanda and Protestants and Catholics in Ulster, on the grounds that they constitute 'distinct ethnic groups' and are thus culturally incapable of co-habitation"&lt;ref name="Monbiot"/&gt; (a point rejected by Goldsmith&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Goldsmith |first=Edward |url=http://www.edwardgoldsmith.com/page197.html |title=Letter to the Guardian |publisher=Edward Goldsmith |date=2002-04-30 |accessdate=2016-08-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080725090728/http://www.edwardgoldsmith.com/page197.html |archivedate=25 July 2008 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;). That, along with other attacks, eventually led Goldsmith to counter his critics with his indepth rebuttal [https://web.archive.org/web/20091215053128/http://www.edwardgoldsmith.com/page3.html ''My Answer''].&lt;ref name="Answer"/&gt;

Goldsmith's close association with his brother, Sir James Goldsmith, his lifelong friendship with the controversial casino owner and conservationist John Aspinall, along with his anti-[[modernity|modernist]] stance and support for [[indigenous peoples]], ensured that Goldsmith had many detractors throughout his life. Still, Goldsmith received affectionate support and respect from across the full spectrum of the environmental movement and from many of the people whose views and preoccupations were the focus of his theoretical and philosophical critique.&lt;ref name="Guardian"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Telegraph"/&gt;

Goldsmith's message continued to be sponsored around the world, in particular through his work with the [[International Forum on Globalization]] (IFG), and, regardless of their previous acrimony, Hildyard and Goldsmith went on to restore their former friendship.{{cn|date=June 2018}}

'''Eros'''  ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|ɪər|ɒ|s}} or {{IPAc-en|ˈ|ɛr|ɒ|s}}; {{lang-grc|ἔρως}} ''érōs'' "love" or "desire") is one of [[Greek words for love|the four ancient Greco-Christian terms]]  which can be rendered into English as "[[love]]". The other three are ''[[storge]]'', ''[[philia]]'', and ''[[agape]]''. ''Eros'' refers to "passionate love" or romantic love; ''storge'' to familial love; ''philia'' to friendship as a kind of love; and ''agape'' refers to "selfless love", or "[[charity (virtue)|charity]]" as it is translated in the Christian scriptures (from the Latin ''[[wikt:caritas|caritas]]'', dearness).&lt;ref&gt;C.S. Lewis, ''[[The Four Loves]]''&lt;/ref&gt; 

The term ''[[erotic]]'' is derived from ''eros''. ''Eros'' has also been used in [[philosophy]] and [[psychology]] in a much wider sense, almost as an equivalent to "life energy".

==In literature==

===The classical Greek tradition===
In the classical world, erotic love was generally referred to as a kind of madness or ''theia mania'' ("madness from the gods").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

  | doi =
  | id =
  | accessdate =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;  This love passion was described through an elaborate metaphoric and mythological [[schema (psychology)|schema]] involving "love's arrows" or "love darts", the source of which was often the personified figure of [[Eros (mythology)|Eros]] (or his Latin counterpart, [[Cupid]]),&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, the ''[[Amores (Ovid)|Amores]]'' and the ''[[Heroides]]'' of [[Ovid]] which frequently refer to the overwhelming passion caused by Cupid's darts.&lt;/ref&gt; or another deity (such as [[Pheme|Rumor]]&lt;ref&gt;See Paris's letter to Helen of Troy, in Ovid, ''Heroides and Amores,'' XVI, 36-38.&lt;/ref&gt;). At times the source of the arrows was said to be the image of the beautiful love object itself. If these arrows were to arrive at the lover's eyes, they would then travel to and 'pierce' or 'wound' his or her heart and overwhelm him/her with desire and longing ([[lovesickness]]).  The image of the "arrow's wound" was sometimes used to create [[oxymoron]]s and rhetorical [[antithesis]] concerning its pleasure and pain.

"[[Love at first sight]]" was explained as a sudden and immediate beguiling of the lover through the action of these processes, but this was not the only mode of entering into passionate love in classical texts. At times the passion could occur after the initial meeting, as, for example, in [[Phaedra (mythology)|Phaedra]]'s letter to [[Hippolytus (mythology)|Hippolytus]] in Ovid's ''Heroides'': "That time I went to Eleusis... it was then most of all (though you had pleased me before) that piercing love lodged in my deepest bones."&lt;ref&gt;Ovid, ''Heroides and Amores,'' translated by Grant Showerman.  Second edition revised by G.P. Goold.  Loeb Classical Library (Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1986), IV, 67-70, p 49.  {{ISBN|0-674-99045-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;  At times, the passion could even precede the first glimpse, as in [[Paris (mythology)|Paris]]' letter to [[Helen of Troy]] in the same work, where Paris says that his love for Helen came upon him before he had set eyes on her: "...you were my heart's desire before you were known to me.  I beheld your features with my soul ere I saw them with my eyes; rumour, that told me of you, was the first to deal my wound."&lt;ref&gt;Ovid, ''Heroides and Amores,'' translated by Grant Showerman, second edition revised by G.P. Goold (Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1986), XVI, 36-38, pp. 199-201.&lt;/ref&gt;

Whether by "first sight" or by other routes, passionate love often had disastrous results according to the classical authors.  In the event that the loved one was cruel or uninterested, this desire was shown to drive the lover into a state of depression, causing lamentation and illness.  Occasionally, the loved one was depicted as an unwitting ensnarer of the lover, because of her sublime beauty—a "divine curse" which inspires men to kidnap her or try to rape her.&lt;ref&gt;For more on these tropes in the Ancient Greek novel, see Françoise Létoublon, ''Les Lieux communs du roman: Stéréotypes grecs d'aventure et d'amour'', Leiden: E.J.Brill, 1993.  {{ISBN|90-04-09724-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  Stories in which unwitting men catch sight of the naked body of [[Artemis]] the huntress (and sometimes [[Aphrodite]]) lead to similar ravages (as in the tale of [[Actaeon]]).

===European literature===
The classical conception of love's arrows was developed further by the [[troubadour]] poets of [[Provence]] during the [[Middle Ages|medieval period]], and became part of the European [[courtly love]] tradition. The role of a woman's eyes in eliciting erotic desire was particularly emphasized by the Provençal poets, as N.E. Griffin points out:

&lt;blockquote&gt;According to this description, love originates upon the eyes of the lady when encountered by those of her future lover.  The love thus generated is conveyed on bright beams of light from her eyes to his, through which it passes to take up its abode in his heart.
&lt;ref&gt;See the introduction by Nathaniel Edward Griffin to ''[[Il Filostrato|The Filostrato]]'' of [[Giovanni Boccaccio]] (New York: Bilbo and Tannen, no date. {{ISBN|0-8196-0187-X}}), p.76, note 2.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
In some medieval texts, the gaze of a beautiful woman is compared to the sight of a [[basilisk]]—a legendary reptile said to have the power to cause death with a single glance.

These images continued to be circulated and elaborated upon in the literature and iconography of the [[Renaissance]] and [[Baroque]] periods.&lt;ref&gt;For a full discussion of the scene of "love at first sight" in fiction, see [[Jean Rousset]], ''"Leurs yeux se rencontrèrent" : la scène de première vue dans le roman'', Paris: José Corti, 1981.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Giovanni Boccaccio|Boccaccio]] for example, in his ''[[Il Filostrato]]'', mixes the tradition of Cupid's arrow with the Provençal emphasis on the eyes as the birthplace of love: "Nor did he ([[Troilus]]) who was so wise shortly before... perceive that Love with his darts dwelt within the rays of those lovely eyes... nor notice the arrow that sped to his heart."&lt;ref&gt;[[Giovanni Boccaccio]], ''[[Il Filostrato]]'', canto 1, strophe 29; translation by Nathaniel Edward Griffin and Arthur Beckwith Myrick, p. 147. According to Griffin: "In the description of the enamorment of Troilus is a singular blending of the Provençal conception of the eyes as the birthplace of love with the classical idea of the God of Love with his bows and quiver..." (ibid., p.77, note 2).&lt;/ref&gt;

The rhetorical antithesis between the pleasure and pain from love's dart continued through the 17th century, as for example, in these classically inspired images from [[The Fairy-Queen]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;If Love's a Sweet Passion, why does it torment?&lt;br&gt;If a Bitter, oh tell me whence comes my content?&lt;br&gt;Since I suffer with pleasure, why should I complain,&lt;br&gt;Or grieve at my Fate, when I know 'tis in vain?&lt;br&gt;Yet so pleasing the Pain is, so soft is the Dart,&lt;br&gt;That at once it both wounds me, and Tickles my Heart.&lt;ref&gt;Anonymous, "If Love's a Sweet Passion", from the libretto of [[Henry Purcell]]'s ''[[The Fairy-Queen]]'', act 3.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==In philosophy and psychology==

===Plato===
The ancient philosopher [[Plato]] developed an [[idealistic]] concept of eros which would prove to be very influential in modern times. In general, [[Plato]] did not consider physical attraction to be a necessary part of eros. "[[Platonic love]]" in this original sense can be attained by the intellectual purification of eros from carnal into ideal form. This process is examined in Plato's dialogue the ''[[Symposium (Plato)|Symposium]]''. Plato argues there that eros is initially felt for a person, but with contemplation it can become an appreciation for the beauty within that person, or even an appreciation for beauty itself in an ideal sense. As Plato expresses it, eros can help the soul to "remember" beauty in its pure form. It follows from this, for Plato, that eros can contribute to an understanding of truth.

Eros, understood in this sense, differed considerably from the common meaning of the word in the Greek language of Plato's time. It also differed from the meaning of the word in contemporary literature and poetry. For Plato, eros is neither purely human nor purely divine: it is something intermediate which he calls a [[daimon]]. 

&lt;blockquote&gt;Its main characteristic is permanent aspiration and desire. Even when it seems to give, eros continues to be a "desire to possess", but nevertheless it is different from a purely sensual love in being the love that tends towards the sublime. According to Plato, the gods do not love, because they do not experience desires, inasmuch as their desires are all satisfied. They can thus only be an object, not a subject of love (''Symposium'' 200-1). For this reason they do not have a direct relationship with man; it is only the mediation of eros that allows the connecting of a relationship (''Symposium'' 203). Eros is thus the way that leads man to divinity, but not vice versa.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;[...] Nevertheless, eros remains always, for Plato, an egocentric love: it tends toward conquering and possessing the object that represents a value for man. To love the good signifies to desire to possess it forever. Love is therefore always a desire for immortality.&lt;ref&gt;John Paul II, ''Man and Woman He Created Them: a theology of the body'', translated by Michael Waldstein (Boston: Pauline Books and Media), 47:1 (p.315), footnote 56. See also Anders Nygren, ''Agape and eros'', translated by Philip S. Watson (University of Chicago Press).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Paradoxically, for Plato, the object of eros does not have to be physically beautiful. This is because the object of eros is beauty, and the greatest beauty is eternal, whereas physical beauty is in no way eternal. However, if the lover achieves possession of the beloved's ''inner'' (i.e., ideal) beauty, his need for happiness will be fulfilled, because happiness is the experience of knowing that you are participating in the ideal.&lt;ref&gt;Plato. Symposium. 199c5-212c&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sigmund Freud{{anchor|Eros and Sigmund Freud}} ===
In [[Sigmund Freud|Freudian]] [[psychology]], eros, not to be confused with [[libido]], is not exclusively the sex drive, but our life force, the will to live. It is the desire to create life, and favors productivity and construction. In early psychoanalytic writings, instincts from the eros were opposed by forces from the [[Id, ego and super-ego#Ego|ego]]. But in later psychoanalytic theory, eros is opposed by the destructive death instinct of [[death drive|Thanatos]] (death instinct or death drive).

In his 1925 paper "The Resistances to Psycho-Analysis",&lt;ref&gt;Freud, S. (1925). "The Resistances to Psycho-Analysis", in ''The Collected Papers of Sigmund Freud'', Vol. 5, p.163-74. (Tr. James Strachey.)&lt;/ref&gt; Freud explains that the psychoanalytic concept of sexual energy is more in line with the [[Plato]]nic view of eros, as expressed in the [[Symposium (Plato)|Symposium]], than with the common use of the word "sex" as related primarily to genital activity. He also mentions the philosopher [[Arthur Schopenhauer|Schopenhauer]] as an influence. He then goes on to confront his adversaries for ignoring such great precursors and for tainting his whole theory of eros with a ''[[pansexual]]'' tendency. He finally writes that his theory naturally explains this collective misunderstanding as a predictable [[Resistance (psychology)|resistance]] to the acknowledgement of sexual activity in childhood.

However, F. M. Cornford finds the standpoints of Plato and of Freud to be "diametrically opposed" with regard to eros. In Plato, eros is a spiritual energy initially, which then "falls" downward; whereas in Freud eros is a physical energy which is "sublimated" upward.&lt;ref&gt;Cornford, F.M. (1950), "The Doctrine of Eros in Plato's Symposium", in ''The Unwritten Philosophy''.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[philosophy|philosopher]] and [[sociology|sociologist]] [[Herbert Marcuse]] appropriated the Freudian concept of eros for his highly influential 1955 work ''[[Eros and Civilization]]''.

===Carl Jung===
In [[Carl Jung]]'s analytical psychology, the counterpart to eros is ''[[logos]]'', a Greek term for the principle of rationality. Jung considers logos to be a masculine principle, while eros is a feminine principle. According to Jung:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Woman's psychology is founded on the principle of ''Eros'', the great binder and loosener, whereas from ancient times the ruling principle ascribed to man is ''Logos''. The concept of ''Eros'' could be expressed in modern terms as psychic relatedness, and that of ''Logos'' as objective interest.&lt;ref&gt;[[Carl Jung]], “Woman in Europe” (1927), in ''Collected Works'' vol. 10, paragraph 255; reprinted in ''Aspects of the Feminine'', Princeton University Press, 1982, p. 65, {{ISBN|0-7100-9522-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This [[gender]]ing of eros and logos is a consequence of Jung's theory of the [[Anima and animus|anima/animus syzygy]] of the human psyche. Syzygy refers to the split between male and female. According to Jung, this split is recapitulated in the unconscious mind by means of "contrasexual" (opposite-gendered) elements called the [[anima and animus|anima]] (in men) and the animus (in women). Thus men have an unconscious feminine principle, the "anima", which is characterized by feminine eros. The work of [[individuation#Carl Gustav Jung|individuation]] for men involves becoming conscious of the anima and learning to accept it as one's own, which entails accepting eros. This is necessary in order to see beyond the [[Psychological projection|projections]] that initially blind the conscious ego. "Taking back the projections" is a major task in the work of individuation, which involves owning and subjectivizing unconscious forces which are initially regarded as alien.&lt;ref&gt;For a critical perspective on this viewpoint, which also summarizes the Jungian position well, see James Hillman, ''The Dream and The Underworld'' (1979), p.100.&lt;/ref&gt;

In essence, Jung's concept of eros is not dissimilar to the Platonic one. Eros is ultimately the desire for wholeness, and although it may initially take the form of passionate love, it is more truly a desire for "psychic relatedness", a desire for interconnection and interaction with other sentient beings. However, Jung was inconsistent, and he did sometimes use the word "eros" as a shorthand to designate sexuality.&lt;ref&gt;Robert H. Hopcke, ''A Guided Tour of the Collected Works of C.G. Jung'', Shambhala Books, 1999, p.45ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Feminism''' is a range of [[political movement]]s, [[ideologies]], and [[social movement]]s that share a common goal: to define, establish, and achieve political, economic, personal, and social [[Gender equality|equality of sexes]].&lt;ref name="Hawkesworth"&gt;{{Cite book |last=Hawkesworth | first=Mary E.|title=Globalization and Feminist Activism |year=2006|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield |pages=25–27 |isbn=9780742537835}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Beasley"&gt;{{Cite book |last=Beasley |first=Chris |title=What is Feminism? |year=1999|publisher=Sage |location=New York |pages=3–11 |isbn=9780761963356}}&lt;/ref&gt; This includes seeking to establish educational and professional opportunities for women that are equal to those for men.

[[Feminist movement]]s have campaigned and continue to campaign for [[women's rights]], including the right to [[Women's suffrage|vote]], to hold public office, [[Right to work|to work]], to earn fair [[wages]] or [[Equal pay for equal work|equal pay]], to [[Right to property|own property]], [[Right to education|to receive education]], to enter contracts, to have equal rights within [[marriage]], and to have [[maternity leave]]. Feminists have also worked to ensure access to legal abortions and [[social integration]], and to protect women and girls from [[rape]], [[sexual harassment]], and [[domestic violence]].&lt;ref name="Echols"&gt;{{Cite book |last=Echols |first=Alice |authorlink=Alice Echols |title=Daring to Be Bad: Radical Feminism in America, 1967–1975 |year=1989 |publisher=University of Minnesota Press |location=Minneapolis |isbn=978-0-8166-1787-6 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; Changes in dress and acceptable physical activity have often been part of feminist movements.&lt;ref name="Distillations"&gt;{{cite magazine|last1=Roberts |first1=Jacob |title=Women's work |magazine=Distillations |date=2017|volume=3|issue=1 |pages=6–11 |url=https://www.sciencehistory.org/distillations/magazine/womens-work|accessdate=22 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some scholars consider feminist campaigns to be a main force behind major historical [[Social change|societal changes]] for [[women's rights]], particularly in [[Western world|the West]], where they are near-universally credited with achieving [[women's suffrage]], [[gender neutrality in English]], [[reproductive rights]] for women (including access to [[contraceptive]]s and [[support for the legalization of abortion|abortion]]), and the right to enter into contracts and [[property|own property]].&lt;ref name="Messer-Davidow"&gt;{{Cite book |last=Messer-Davidow |first=Ellen |title=Disciplining Feminism: From Social Activism to Academic Discourse |year=2002 |publisher=Duke University Press |location=Durham, [[North Carolina|NC]] |isbn=978-0-8223-2843-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although feminist advocacy is, and has been, mainly focused on women's rights, some feminists, including [[bell hooks]], argue for the inclusion of [[men's liberation]] within its aims because they believe that men are also harmed by traditional [[gender roles]].&lt;ref name="hooks"/&gt;
[[Feminist theory]], which emerged from feminist movements, aims to understand the nature of gender inequality by examining women's social roles and lived experience; it has developed theories in a variety of disciplines in order to respond to issues concerning gender.&lt;ref name="Chodorow1989"&gt;{{Cite book |author=Chodorow, Nancy |title=Feminism and Psychoanalytic Theory |year=1989 |publisher=Yale University Press |location=New Haven, Conn. |isbn=978-0-300-05116-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="gilligan1977"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Gilligan |first=Carol |year=1977 |title=In a Different Voice: Women's Conceptions of Self and of Morality|journal=Harvard Educational Review|volume=47|issue=4 |pages=481–517|url=http://hepg.org/her-home/issues/harvard-educational-review-volume-47,-issue-4/herarticle/women-s-conceptions-of-self-and-of-morality_917 |accessdate=8 June 2008 |doi=10.17763/haer.47.4.g6167429416hg5l0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Numerous feminist movements and ideologies have developed over the years and represent different viewpoints and aims. Some forms of feminism have been [[feminism#Civil rights movement and anti-racism|criticized]] for taking into account only white, middle class, and college-educated perspectives. This criticism led to the creation of ethnically specific or [[Multiculturalism|multicultural]] forms of feminism, including [[black feminism]] and [[Intersectionality|intersectional feminism]].&lt;ref name=Weedon/&gt;

The [[First-wave feminism|first wave]] comprised women's suffrage movements of the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, promoting women's right to vote. The [[Second-wave feminism|second wave]] was associated with the ideas and actions of the [[women's liberation movement]] beginning in the 1960s. The second wave campaigned for legal and social equality for women. The [[Third-wave feminism|third wave]] is a continuation of, and a reaction to, the perceived failures of second-wave feminism, which began in the 1990s.&lt;ref name="Suffragettes to Grrls"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Krolokke |first1=Charlotte |first2=Anne Scott |last2=Sorensen |title=Gender Communication Theories and Analyses: From Silence to Performance |year=2005 |publisher=Sage |isbn=978-0-7619-2918-5 |page=24 |chapter=Three Waves of Feminism: From Suffragettes to Grrls}}&lt;/ref&gt;

First-wave feminism was a period of activity during the 19th century and early twentieth century. In the UK and eventually the US, it focused on the promotion of equal contract, marriage, parenting, and property rights for women. By the end of the 19th century, a number of important steps had been made with the passing of legislation such as the UK [[Custody of Infants Act 1839]] which introduced the [[Tender years doctrine]] for child custody arrangement and gave woman the right of custody of their children for the first time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wroath|first=John|title=Until They Are Seven, The Origins of Women's Legal Rights|year=1998|publisher=Waterside Press|isbn=1 872 870 57 0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Mitchell|first=L.

For example, [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] passed legislation in 1884, [[New South Wales]] in 1889, and the remaining Australian colonies passed similar legislation between 1890 and 1897. Therefore, with the turn of the 19th century activism had focused primarily on gaining political power, particularly the right of women's [[suffrage]], though some feminists were active in campaigning for women's [[Sexual and reproductive health and rights|sexual]], [[reproductive rights|reproductive]], and [[Economic, social and cultural rights|economic rights]] as well.&lt;ref name=NoTurningBack464&gt;{{cite book |author=Freedman, Estelle B. |title=No Turning Back : The History of Feminism and the Future of Women |year=2003 |publisher=Ballantine Books |isbn=978-0-345-45053-1 |page=464}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Women's suffrage]] (the right to vote and stand for parliamentary office) began in Britain's [[Australasia]]n colonies at the close of the 19th century, with the self-governing colonies of [[Feminism in New Zealand|New Zealand]] granting women the [[right to vote]] in 1893 and South Australia granting female suffrage in 1895. This was followed by Australia granting female suffrage in 1902.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.elections.org.nz/votes-women |title=Votes for Women Electoral Commission|publisher=Elections New Zealand |date=13 April 2005 |accessdate=31 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aec.gov.au/Elections/Australian_Electoral_History/wright.htm|title=Women and the right to vote in Australia|publisher=Australian Electoral Commission |date=28 January 2011 |accessdate=26 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Britain]] the Suffragettes and the [[National Union of Women's Suffrage Societies|Suffragists]] campaigned for the women's vote, and in 1918 the [[Representation of the People Act 1918|Representation of the People Act]] was passed granting the vote to women over the age of 30 who owned property.

Anthony]], who each campaigned for the [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolition of slavery]] prior to championing women's right to vote. These women were influenced by the [[Quaker]] theology of spiritual equality, which asserts that men and women are equal under God.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ruether|first=Rosemary Radford|title=Women and Redemption: A Theological History|publisher=Fortress Press|location=Minneapolis|isbn=978-0-8006-9816-4|pages=112–18, 136–39|edition=2nd|year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States, first-wave feminism is considered to have ended with the passage of the [[Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution]] (1919), granting women the right to vote in all states.

According to Nawar al-Hassan Golley, Arab feminism was closely connected with [[Arab nationalism]]. In 1899, [[Qasim Amin]], considered the "father" of Arab feminism, wrote ''The Liberation of Women'', which argued for legal and social reforms for women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Stange |first1=Mary Zeiss |first2=Carol K. |last2=Oyster |first3=Jane E. |last3=Sloan |title=Encyclopedia of Women in Today's World |publisher=SAGE |year=2011 |isbn=978-1-4129-7685-5 |pages=79–81}}&lt;/ref&gt; He drew links between women's position in Egyptian society and nationalism, leading to the development of Cairo University and the National Movement.&lt;ref name=Golley&gt;{{cite book |last=Golley |first=Nawar Al-Hassan |title=Reading Arab women's autobiographies: Shahrazad tells her story |publisher=University of Texas Press |year=2003 |pages=30–50 |isbn=978-0-292-70545-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1923 [[Hoda Shaarawi]] founded the [[Egyptian Feminist Union]], became its president and a symbol of the Arab women's rights movement.&lt;ref name=Golley/&gt;

The [[Iranian Constitutional Revolution]] in 1905 triggered the [[Iranian women's movement]], which aimed to achieve women's equality in [[Iranian gender restrictions in education|education]], marriage, careers, and [[Women's rights in Iran|legal rights]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Ettehadieh |first=Mansoureh |authorlink=Mansoureh Ettehadieh |year=2004 |chapter=The Origins and Development of the Women's Movement in Iran, 1906–41 |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=tLRgXf_e_CEC&amp;pg=PA85 |pages=85–106 |title=Women in Iran from 1800 to the Islamic Republic |editor1-first=Lois |editor1-last=Beck |editor2-first=Guity |editor2-last=Nashat |publisher=University of Illinois Press |isbn=978-0-252-07189-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, during the [[Iranian revolution]] of 1979, many of the rights that [[Women in Iran|women]] had gained from the women's movement were systematically abolished, such as the [[Iran's Family Protection Law|Family Protection Law]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |chapter=Chronology of Events Regarding Women in Iran since the Revolution of 1979 |title=Iran since the Revolution |first=Elham |last=Gheytanchi |series=Social Research, Volume 67, No. 2 |year=2000 |editor1-first=Arien |editor1-last=Mack |chapter-url=http://www.iranchamber.com/society/articles/chronology_events_women_iran.php}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Women in France|France]], women obtained the [[Women's suffrage#France|right to vote]] only with the [[Provisional Government of the French Republic]] of 21 April 1944. The Consultative Assembly of Algiers of 1944 proposed on 24 March 1944 to grant eligibility to women but following an amendment by [[Fernand Grenier]], they were given full citizenship, including the right to vote. Grenier's proposition was adopted 51 to 16. In May 1947, following the [[French legislative election, November 1946|November 1946 elections]], the sociologist Robert Verdier minimized the "[[gender differences|gender gap]]", stating in ''[[Le Populaire]]'' that women had not voted in a consistent way, dividing themselves, as men, according to social classes. During the [[Post-World War II baby boom|baby boom]] period, feminism waned in importance. Wars (both World War I and World War II) had seen the provisional emancipation of some women, but post-war periods signalled the return to conservative roles.&lt;ref name=Bard&gt;{{cite journal |first=Christine |last=Bard |url=http://www.histoire-politique.fr/index.php?numero=01&amp;rub=dossier&amp;item=7 |title=Les premières femmes au Gouvernement (France, 1936–1981) |trans-title=First Women in Government (France, 1936–1981) |journal=[[Histoire@Politique]] |issue=1 |date=May–June 2007 |language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Mid-twentieth century ===
By the mid 20th century, in some European countries, women still lacked some significant rights. Feminists in these countries continued to fight for voting rights. In [[Women in Switzerland|Switzerland]], women gained the [[Women's suffrage in Switzerland|right to vote]] in federal [[Elections in Switzerland|elections]] in 1971;&lt;ref name="switzerland-chronology"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://history-switzerland.geschichte-schweiz.ch/chronology-womens-right-vote-switzerland.html |title=The Long Way to Women's Right to Vote in Switzerland: a Chronology |publisher=History-switzerland.geschichte-schweiz.ch |accessdate=2011-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; but in the canton of [[Appenzell Innerrhoden]] women obtained the right to vote on local issues only in 1991, when the canton was forced to do so by the [[Federal Supreme Court of Switzerland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/News/Press/docs/2003/WOM1373.doc.htm |title=United Nations press release of a meeting of the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW), issued on 14 January 2003 |publisher=Un.org |accessdate=2011-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Liechtenstein]], women were given the right to vote by the [[Liechtenstein women's suffrage referendum, 1984|women's suffrage referendum of 1984]]. Three prior referendums held in [[Liechtenstein women's suffrage referendum, 1968|1968]], [[Liechtenstein women's suffrage referendum, 1971|1971]] and [[Liechtenstein women's suffrage referendum, 1973|1973]] had failed to secure women's right to vote.

Feminists continued to campaign for the reform of [[family law]]s which gave husbands control over their wives. Although by the 20th century [[coverture]] had been abolished in the UK and the US, in many [[continental European]] countries married women still had very few rights. For instance, in France married women did not receive the right to work without their husband's permission until 1965.&lt;ref name=Guillaumin&gt;{{cite book |last=Guillaumin|first=Colette|year=1994 |title=Racism, Sexism, Power, and Ideology |pages=193–95}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Meltzer&gt;{{cite book |last=Meltzer |first=Françoise |year=1995 |title=Hot Property: The Stakes and Claims of Literary Originality |page=88}}&lt;/ref&gt; Feminists have also worked to abolish the [[marital rape|"marital exemption" in rape laws]] which precluded the prosecution of husbands for the rape of their wives.&lt;ref name=Allison&gt;{{cite book |last=Allison |first=Julie A. |year=1995 |title=Rape: The Misunderstood Crime |page=89}}&lt;/ref&gt; Earlier efforts by first-wave feminists such as [[Voltairine de Cleyre]], [[Victoria Woodhull]] and [[Elizabeth Clarke Wolstenholme Elmy]] to criminalize marital rape in the late 19th century had failed;&lt;ref name=Bland&gt;{{cite book |last=Bland |first=Lucy |year=2002 |title=Banishing the Beast: Feminism, Sex and Morality |url=https://books.google.com/?id=Cl8nLdfgz1IC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage |accessdate=25 August 2013 |pages=135–49|isbn=9781860646812 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | issn = 1040-0656 | volume = 7 | issue = 3 | pages = 54–68 [60] | last = Palczewski | first = Catherine Helen | title = Voltairine de Cleyre: Sexual Slavery and Sexual Pleasure in the Nineteenth Century | journal = NWSA Journal | date = 1995-10-01 | jstor = 4316402 }}&lt;/ref&gt; this was only achieved a century later in most Western countries, but is still not achieved in many other parts of the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Crowell |first1=Nancy A. |last2=Burgess |first2=Ann W. |year=1997 |title=Understanding Violence Against Women |page=127}}&lt;/ref&gt;

French philosopher [[Simone de Beauvoir]] provided a [[Marxist]] solution and an [[existentialist]] view on many of the questions of feminism with the publication of ''Le Deuxième Sexe'' (''[[The Second Sex]]'') in 1949.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Bergoffen |first=Debra |title=Simone de Beauvoir |date=16 August 2010 |origyear=17 August 2004 |publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, CSLI, Stanford University |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/beauvoir/ |accessdate=4 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book expressed feminists' sense of injustice. Second-wave feminism is a feminist movement beginning in the early 1960s&lt;ref name=Whelehan&gt;{{cite book |last=Whelehan |first=Imelda |title=Modern Feminist Thought: From the Second Wave to 'Post-Feminism' |year=1995 |publisher=Edinburgh University Press |location=Edinburgh |isbn=978-0-7486-0621-4 |pages=25–43}}&lt;/ref&gt; and continuing to the present; as such, it coexists with third-wave feminism. Second-wave feminism is largely concerned with issues of equality beyond suffrage, such as ending [[Sexism|gender discrimination]].&lt;ref name=NoTurningBack464/&gt;

Second-wave feminists see women's cultural and political inequalities as inextricably linked and encourage women to understand aspects of their personal lives as deeply politicized and as reflecting sexist power structures. The feminist activist and author [[Carol Hanisch]] coined the slogan "The Personal is Political", which became synonymous with the second wave.&lt;ref name=Echols/&gt;&lt;ref name=Hanisch&gt;{{cite web |url=http://scholar.alexanderstreet.com/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=2259 |title=Hanisch, New Intro to 'The Personal is Political' – Second Wave and Beyond |accessdate=8 June 2008 |last=Hanisch |first=Carol |date=1 January 2006 |website=The Personal Is Political |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080515014413/http://scholar.alexanderstreet.com/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=2259 |archivedate=15 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Second- and third-wave feminism in China has been characterized by a reexamination of women's roles during the communist revolution and other reform movements, and new discussions about whether women's equality has actually been fully achieved.&lt;ref name="Dooling" /&gt;

In 1956, President [[Gamal Abdel Nasser]] of [[Feminism in Egypt|Egypt]] initiated "[[state feminism]]", which outlawed [[Human rights in Egypt#Status of women|discrimination based on gender]] and granted women's suffrage, but also blocked political [[activism]] by feminist leaders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Badran |first=Margot |title=Feminists, Islam, and nation: gender and the making of modern Egypt |publisher=Princeton University Press |year=1996 |isbn=978-0-691-02605-3}}{{page needed|date=October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; During [[Anwar Sadat|Sadat]]'s presidency, his wife, [[Jehan Sadat]], publicly advocated further women's rights, though Egyptian policy and society began to move away from women's equality with the new [[Islamist]] movement and growing conservatism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Smith |first=Bonnie G. |title=Global feminisms since 1945 |publisher=Psychology Press |year=2000 |isbn=978-0-415-18491-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, some activists proposed a new feminist movement, [[Islamic feminism]], which argues for women's equality within an Islamic framework.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.milligazette.com/Archives/2004/16-31Jan04-Print-Edition/1631200425.htm |title=Islamic feminism means justice to women |website= The Mili Gazette |accessdate=31 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Feminism in Latin America|Latin America]], revolutions brought changes in women's status in countries such as [[Role of women in Nicaraguan Revolution|Nicaragua]], where [[feminist ideology during the Sandinista Revolution]] aided women's quality of life but fell short of achieving a social and ideological change.&lt;ref name="parpart"&gt;{{Cite book |last=Parpart |first=Jane L. |last2=Connelly |first2=M.

In 1963, [[Betty Friedan]]'s book ''[[The Feminine Mystique]]'' was published and helped voice the discontent that American women felt. The book is widely credited with sparking the beginning of [[second-wave feminism]] in the United States.&lt;ref name="nytimes2006"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/02/05/us/betty-friedan-who-ignited-cause-in-feminine-mystique-dies-at-85.html|title=Betty Friedan, Who Ignited Cause in 'Feminine Mystique,' Dies at 85|date=5 February 2006|author=Margalit Fox|publisher=The New York Times|accessdate=19 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book's success also meant that Friedan could lecture her views while she was on tour in 1970.

==== Third-wave feminism ====
{{main|Third-wave feminism}}
[[File:Lozu mont oct8 bellhooooooooks.png|thumb|right|upright=0.8|Feminist, author and social activist [[bell hooks]] (b. 1952).]]
[[Third-wave feminism]] is traced to the emergence of the [[Riot grrrl]] feminist [[punk subculture]] in [[Olympia, Washington]], in the early 1990s,&lt;ref&gt;Steve Feliciano (New York Public Library, 2013): "The emergence of the Riot Grrrl movement began in the early 1990s, when a group of women in Olympia, Washington, held a meeting to discuss how to address sexism in the punk scene. The women decided they wanted to start a 'girl riot' against a society they felt offered no validation of women's experiences. And thus the Riot Grrrl movement was born."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Feliciano|first1=Steve|title=The Riot Grrrl Movement|url=http://www.nypl.org/blog/2013/06/19/riot-grrrl-movement|publisher=New York Public Library|date=19 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and to [[Anita Hill]]'s televised testimony in 1991—to an all-male, all-white [[Senate Judiciary Committee]]—that [[Clarence Thomas Supreme Court nomination|Clarence Thomas]], nominated for the [[Supreme Court of the United States]], had [[Sexual harassment|sexually harassed]] her. The term ''third wave'' is credited to [[Rebecca Walker]], who responded to Thomas's appointment to the Supreme Court with an article in ''[[Ms. (magazine)|Ms.]]'' magazine, "Becoming the Third Wave" (1992).&lt;ref name="MsMagazineThirdWave"&gt;{{cite journal| last1 = Walker| first1 = Rebecca | authorlink1 = Rebecca Walker| editor-last=| editor-first =| editor-link=| title = Becoming the Third Wave| journal = [[Ms. (magazine)|Ms.]]| issue = | pages = 39–41| issn = 0047-8318| oclc = 194419734|date= January 1992|url=http://www.msmagazine.com/spring2002/BecomingThirdWaveRebeccaWalker.pdf|format=pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Baumgardner_Richards"&gt;{{cite book |title=Manifesta: Young Women, Feminism, and the Future |last1=Baumgardner |first1=Jennifer |author1-link=Jennifer Baumgardner |last2=Richards |first2=Amy |author2-link=Amy Richards |year=2000 |publisher=[[Farrar, Straus and Giroux]] |location=New York |isbn=978-0-374-52622-1 |p=77|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; She wrote:

{{quote|So I write this as a plea to all women, especially women of my generation: Let Thomas’ confirmation serve to remind you, as it did me, that the fight is far from over.

Third-wave feminism also sought to challenge or avoid what it deemed the second wave's [[Essentialism|essentialist]] definitions of [[femininity]], which, third-wave feminists argued, over-emphasized the experiences of upper middle-class white women. Third-wave feminists often focused on "[[wikt:micropolitics|micro-politics]]" and challenged the second wave's paradigm as to what was, or was not, good for women, and tended to use a [[post-structuralism|post-structuralist]] interpretation of gender and sexuality.&lt;ref name=NoTurningBack464/&gt;&lt;ref name=Henry&gt;{{cite book |last=Henry |first=Astrid |title=Not my mother's sister: generational conflict and third-wave feminism |year=2004 |publisher=Indiana University Press |location=Bloomington |isbn=978-0-253-21713-4 |pages=1–288}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Gillis&gt;{{cite book |last1=Gillis |first1=Stacy |last2=Howie |first2=Gillian |last3=Munford |first3=Rebecca |title=Third wave feminism: a critical exploration |year=2007 |publisher=Palgrave Macmillan |location=Basingstoke |isbn=978-0-230-52174-2 |pages=xxviii, 275–76}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Faludi&gt;{{cite book |last=Faludi |first=Susan |authorlink=Susan Faludi |title=Backlash: the undeclared war against women |year=1992 |publisher=Vintage |location=London |isbn=978-0-09-922271-2}}{{page needed|date=October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Feminist leaders rooted in the second wave, such as [[Gloria Anzaldúa]], [[bell hooks]], [[Chela Sandoval]], [[Cherríe Moraga]], [[Audre Lorde]], [[Maxine Hong Kingston]], and many other non-white feminists, sought to negotiate a space within feminist thought for consideration of race-related subjectivities.&lt;ref name=Gillis/&gt;&lt;ref name=Walker/&gt;&lt;ref name=Heywood&gt;{{cite book |last1=Leslie |first1=Heywood |last2=Drake |first2=Jennifer |title=Third Wave Agenda: Being Feminist, Doing Feminism |year=1997 |publisher=University of Minnesota Press |location=Minneapolis |isbn=978-0-8166-3005-9}}{{page needed|date=October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Third-wave feminism also contained internal debates between [[difference feminism|difference feminists]], who believe that there are important psychological differences between the sexes, and those who believe that there are no inherent psychological differences between the sexes and contend that gender roles are due to [[social conditioning]].&lt;ref name=Gilligan&gt;{{cite book |last=Gilligan |first=Carol |authorlink=Carol Gilligan |title=In a different voice: psychological theory and women's development |year=1993 |publisher=Harvard University Press |location=Cambridge, Massachusetts |isbn=978-0-674-44544-4 |page=184}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Standpoint theory ====
Standpoint theory is a feminist theoretical point of view that believes a persons' social position influences their knowledge.  This perspective argues that research and theory treats women and the feminist movement as insignificant and refuses to see traditional science as unbiased.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = standpoint theory {{!}} feminism|url = http://www.britannica.com/topic/standpoint-theory|website = Encyclopædia Britannica|access-date = 2016-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the 1980s, [[Standpoint feminism|standpoint feminists]] have argued that the feminist movement should address [[global issue]]s (such as rape, [[incest]], and prostitution) and culturally specific issues (such as [[female genital mutilation]] in some parts of [[Women in Africa|Africa]] and [[Women in Arab societies|Arab societies]], as well as [[glass ceiling]] practices that impede women's advancement in developed economies) in order to understand how gender inequality interacts with racism, [[homophobia]], [[classism]] and [[colonization]] in a "[[matrix of domination]]".&lt;ref name="BFT"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Harding2003&gt;{{cite book |last=Harding |first=Sandra |authorlink=Sandra Harding |title=The Feminist Standpoint Theory Reader: Intellectual and Political Controversies |year=2003 |publisher=Routledge |location=London |isbn=978-0-415-94501-1 |pages=1–16, 67–80}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Fourth-wave feminism ====
{{main|Fourth-wave feminism}}
[[Fourth-wave feminism]] refers to a resurgence of interest in feminism that began around 2012 and is associated with the use of [[social media]].&lt;ref name=4thWave-Guardian20131210/&gt; According to feminist scholar Prudence Chamberlain, the focus of the fourth wave is justice for women and opposition to [[sexual harassment]] and [[violence against women]]. Its essence, she writes, is "incredulity that certain attitudes can still exist".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|ref=harv|last=Chamberlain|first=Prudence|title=The Feminist Fourth Wave: Affective Temporality|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8AIkDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA115|year=2017|publisher=Springer|location=Cham|isbn=978-3-319-53682-8|page=115}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fourth-wave feminism is "defined by technology", according to [[Kira Cochrane]], and is characterized particularly by the use of [[Facebook]], [[Twitter]], [[Instagram]], [[YouTube]], [[Tumblr]], and blogs such as [[Feministing]] to challenge [[misogyny]] and further [[gender equality]].&lt;ref name="4thWave-Guardian20131210"&gt;{{cite news|last=Cochrane|first=Kira|authorlink=Kira Cochrane|title=The Fourth Wave of Feminism: Meet the Rebel Women|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/dec/10/fourth-wave-feminism-rebel-women|newspaper=The Guardian|date=10 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/15/magazine/15fob-q4-t.html|title=The Blogger and Author on the Life of Women Online|last=Solomon|first=Deborah|date=13 November 2009|work=The New York Times|access-date=16 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://nowtoronto.com/news/feminisms-fourth-wave-is-the-shitlist/|title=Feminism's Fourth Wave is the Shitlist|last=Zerbisias|first=Antonia|date=16 September 2015|website=NOW Toronto|publisher=|access-date=21 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="4thWave-Guardian20131210"/&gt;

Issues that fourth-wave feminists focus on include [[street harassment|street]] and [[workplace harassment]], [[campus sexual assault]] and [[rape culture]]. Scandals involving the harassment, abuse, and murder of women and girls have galvanized the movement. These have included the 2012 [[2012 Delhi gang rape|Delhi gang rape]], 2012 [[Jimmy Savile sexual abuse scandal|Jimmy Savile allegations]], the [[Bill Cosby sexual assault case|Bill Cosby allegations]], 2014 [[2014 Isla Vista killings|Isla Vista killings]], 2016 [[trial of Jian Ghomeshi]], 2017 [[Harvey Weinstein sexual abuse allegations|Harvey Weinstein allegations]] and subsequent [[Weinstein effect]], and the 2017 [[2017 Westminster sexual scandals|Westminster sexual scandals]].&lt;ref&gt;For Cosby, Ghomeshi, #MeToo, and fourth wave, see Matheson, Kelsey (17 October 2017).

==== Post-feminism ====
The term [[post-feminism]] is used to describe a range of viewpoints reacting to feminism since the 1980s. While not being "anti-feminist", post-feminists believe that women have achieved second wave goals while being critical of third and fourth wave feminist goals. The term was first used to describe a backlash against second-wave feminism, but it is now a label for a wide range of theories that take critical approaches to previous feminist discourses and includes challenges to the second wave's ideas.&lt;ref name=Wright2000&gt;{{cite book |last=Wright |first=Elizabeth |title=Lacan and Postfeminism (Postmodern Encounters) |year=2000 |publisher=Totem Books |isbn=978-1-84046-182-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other post-feminists say that feminism is no longer relevant to today's society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Modleski |first=Tania |title=Feminism without women: culture and criticism in a 'postfeminist' age |year=1991 |publisher=Routledge |location=New York |isbn=978-0-415-90416-2 |page=188}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Amelia Jones]] has written that the post-feminist texts which emerged in the 1980s and 1990s portrayed second-wave feminism as a monolithic entity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Jones |first=Amelia |chapter=Postfeminism, Feminist Pleasures, and Embodied Theories of Art |title=New Feminist Criticism: Art, Identity, Action |editor1-first=Joana |editor1-last=Frueh |editor2-first=Cassandra L. |editor2-last=Langer |editor3-first=Arlene |editor3-last=Raven |location=New York |publisher=HarperCollins |year=1994 |pages=16–41, 20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dorothy Chunn notes a "blaming narrative" under the post-feminist moniker, where feminists are undermined for continuing to make demands for [[gender equality]] in a "post-feminist" society, where "gender equality has (already) been achieved." According to Chunn, "many feminists have voiced disquiet about the ways in which rights and equality discourses are now used against them."&lt;ref&gt;Chunn, D. (2007).

{{see also|Gynocriticism|écriture féminine}}
Feminist theory is the extension of feminism into theoretical or philosophical fields.

While providing a critique of these social and political relations, much of feminist theory also focuses on the promotion of women's rights and interests. Themes explored in feminist theory include discrimination, [[stereotyping]], [[objectification]] (especially [[sexual objectification]]), [[oppression]], and [[patriarchy]].&lt;ref name=Chodorow1989/&gt;&lt;ref name=gilligan1977/&gt;
In the field of [[literary criticism]], [[Elaine Showalter]] describes the development of feminist theory as having three phases. The first she calls "feminist critique", in which the feminist reader examines the ideologies behind literary phenomena. The second Showalter calls "[[gynocriticism]]", in which the "woman is producer of textual meaning". The last phase she calls "gender theory", in which the "ideological inscription and the literary effects of the sex/gender system are explored".&lt;ref name=showalter1979&gt;{{cite book |last1=Showalter |first1=Elaine |authorlink1=Elaine Showalter |editor1-first=M. |editor1-last=Jacobus |title=Women Writing about Women |year=1979 |publisher=Croom Helm |isbn=978-0-85664-745-1 |pages=25–36 |chapter=Towards a Feminist Poetics}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This was paralleled in the 1970s by [[French structuralist feminism|French feminists]], who developed the concept of ''[[écriture féminine]]'' (which translates as 'female or feminine writing').&lt;ref name=Wright2000/&gt; [[Helene Cixous]] argues that writing and philosophy are ''[[Wikt:phallocentric|phallocentric]]'' and along with other French feminists such as [[Luce Irigaray]] emphasize "writing from the body" as a subversive exercise.&lt;ref name=Wright2000/&gt; The work of [[Julia Kristeva]], a feminist psychoanalyst and philosopher, and [[Bracha Ettinger]],&lt;ref&gt;Ettinger, Bracha, 'The Matrixial Borderspace'.

However, as the scholar Elizabeth Wright points out, "none of these French feminists align themselves with the feminist movement as it appeared in the [[English-speaking world|Anglophone]] world".&lt;ref name=Wright2000/&gt;&lt;ref name=Moi1986&gt;{{cite book |last1=Kristeva |first1=Julia |last2=Moi |first2=Toril |authorlink2=Toril Moi |title=The Kristeva reader |year=1986 |publisher=Columbia University Press |location=New York |isbn=978-0-231-06325-8 |page=328}}&lt;/ref&gt; More recent feminist theory, such as that of Lisa Lucile Owens,&lt;ref&gt;E.g., {{cite journal |title=Coerced Parenthood as Family Policy: Feminism, the Moral Agency of Women, and Men's 'Right to Choose' |first=Lisa Lucile |last=Owens |journal=Alabama Civil Rights &amp; Civil Liberties Law Review |volume=5 |page=1 |year=2003 |ssrn=2439294}}&lt;/ref&gt; has concentrated on characterizing feminism as a universal emancipatory movement.

== Movements and ideologies ==
{{Main|Feminist movements and ideologies}}
[[File:Woman-power emblem.svg|upright=0.45|thumb|right|A symbol of feminism based on the [[Venus symbol]] ]]
Many overlapping feminist movements and ideologies have developed over the years.

=== Political movements ===
Some branches of feminism closely track the political leanings of the larger society, such as liberalism and conservatism, or focus on the environment. [[Liberal feminism]] seeks individualistic equality of men and women through political and legal reform without altering the structure of society. Catherine Rottenberg has argued that the neoliberal shirt in Liberal feminism has led to that form of feminism being individualized rather than collectivized and becoming detached from social inequality.&lt;ref name="rotten"/&gt; Due to this she argues that Liberal Feminism cannot offer any sustained analysis of the structures of male dominance, power, or privilege.&lt;ref name="rotten"&gt;Catherine Rottenberg, "[http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/09502386.2013.857361 The Rise of Neoliberal Feminism]", Cultural Studies. (2014) Vol. 28 (3), pgs. 424&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Radical feminism]] considers the male-controlled capitalist hierarchy as the defining feature of women's oppression and the total uprooting and reconstruction of society as necessary.&lt;ref name="Echols" /&gt; [[List of conservative feminisms|Conservative feminism]] is conservative relative to the society in which it resides. [[Individualist feminism|Libertarian feminism]] conceives of people as self-owners and therefore as entitled to freedom from coercive interference.&lt;ref name="Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/feminism-liberal/#ClasCri |title=Liberal Feminism |website=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University |year=2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Separatist feminism]] does not support heterosexual relationships. Lesbian feminism is thus closely related. Other feminists criticize separatist feminism as sexist.&lt;ref name="hooks"&gt;{{cite book |last=hooks |first=bell |authorlink=Bell hooks |year=2000 |title=Feminism Is for Everybody: Passionate Politics |publisher=[[South End Press]] |location=Cambridge, Massachusetts |isbn=978-0-89608-629-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Eco-feminist|Ecofeminists]] see men's control of land as responsible for the oppression of women and destruction of the [[ecology|natural environment]]; ecofeminism has been criticized for focusing too much on a mystical connection between women and nature.&lt;ref name="Biehl"&gt;{{Cite book |last=Biehl |first=Janet |authorlink=Janet Biehl |title=Rethinking eco-feminist politics |year=1991 |publisher=[[South End Press]] |location=Cambridge, Massachusetts |isbn=978-0-89608-392-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Materialist ideologies ===
[[Rosemary Hennessy]] and Chrys Ingraham say that materialist forms of feminism grew out of Western Marxist thought and have inspired a number of different (but overlapping) movements, all of which are involved in a critique of capitalism and are focused on ideology's relationship to women.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last= Hennessy |first= Rosemary |first2=Chrys |last2=Ingraham |title=Materialist feminism: a reader in class, difference, and women's lives |location= London |publisher=Routledge | pages=1–13 |isbn=978-0-415-91634-9 |year=1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Marxist feminism]] argues that capitalism is the root cause of women's oppression, and that discrimination against women in domestic life and employment is an effect of capitalist ideologies.&lt;ref name="Bottomore"&gt;{{Cite book |author=Bottomore, T.B. |title=A Dictionary of Marxist thought |publisher=Wiley-Blackwell | page=215 |isbn=978-0-631-18082-1 |year=1991}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Socialist feminism]] distinguishes itself from Marxist feminism by arguing that women's liberation can only be achieved by working to end both the economic and cultural sources of women's oppression.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.feministezine.com/feminist/modern/Socialist-Feminism.html |title=What is Socialist Feminism? |author=Barbara Ehrenreich |publisher=feministezine.com |accessdate=3 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Anarcha-feminism|Anarcha-feminists]] believe that [[class struggle]] and [[anarchism|anarchy]] against the [[State (polity)|state]]&lt;ref name="farrow"&gt;{{Cite book |last=Dunbar-Ortiz |first=Roxanne |title=Quiet Rumours |publisher=AK Press |isbn=978-1-902593-40-1 |year=2002 |pages=11–13}}&lt;/ref&gt; require struggling against patriarchy, which comes from involuntary hierarchy.

=== Black and postcolonial ideologies ===
[[Sara Ahmed]] argues that [[Black feminism|Black]] and [[Postcolonial feminism|Postcolonial]] feminisms pose a challenge "to some of the organizing premises of Western feminist thought."&lt;ref name="Ahmed"&gt;{{Cite book |author=Ahmed, Sarta |title= Transformations: thinking through feminism |year=2000 |publisher=Routledge |location=London |isbn=978-0-415-22066-8 |page=111}}&lt;/ref&gt; During much of its [[history of feminism|history]], feminist movements and [[Feminism#Theoretical schools|theoretical developments]] were led predominantly by middle-class white women from Western Europe and North America.&lt;ref name="Walker"&gt;{{Cite book |author=Walker, Alice |title=In Search of Our Mothers' Gardens: Womanist Prose |year=1983 |publisher=Harcourt Brace Jovanovich |location=San Diego |isbn=978-0-15-144525-7 |page=397|title-link=In Search of Our Mothers' Gardens: Womanist Prose }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BFT"&gt;{{cite book |last=Hill Collins |first=P. |title=Black Feminist Thought: Knowledge, Consciousness, and the Politics of Empowerment |location=New York |publisher=Routledge |year=2000 |pages=1–335}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Narayan"/&gt; However women of other races have proposed alternative feminisms.&lt;ref name="BFT" /&gt; This trend accelerated in the 1960s with the civil rights movement in the United States and the collapse of European colonialism in Africa, the Caribbean, parts of Latin America, and Southeast Asia.

According to 2015 poll, 18 percent of Americans consider themselves feminists, while 85 percent reported they believe in "equality for women". Despite the popular belief in equal rights, 52 percent did not identify as feminist, 26 percent were unsure, and four percent provided no response.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last=Allum |first=Cynthia  |date=9 April 2015 |title=82 percent of Americans don't consider themselves feminists, poll shows |work=[[The New York Times]] |url=http://nytlive.nytimes.com/womenintheworld/2015/04/09/82-percent-of-americans-dont-consider-themselves-feminists-poll-shows/ |accessdate=26 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to 2014 [[Ipsos]] poll covering 15 developed countries, 53 percent of respondents identified as feminists, and 87% agreed that "women should be treated equally to men in all areas based on their competency, not their gender". However, only 55% of women agreed that they have "full equality with men and the freedom to reach their full dreams and aspirations".&lt;ref name=ipsos&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ipsos-na.com/news-polls/pressrelease.aspx?id=6511 |last=Clark |first=Julia |title= Can Men Be Feminists Too?

Among women, some of the strongest support for feminism was found in Sweden, where one in three (36%) agreed very much that they defined themselves as feminists. They were followed by women in Italy (31%) and Argentina (29%). Those in the middle of the ranking were from Great Britain (22%), Spain (22%), United States (20%), Australia (18%), Belgium (18%), France (18%), Canada (17%), Poland (17%), and Hungary (15%). Women least likely to agree very much were from Japan (8%), Germany (7%) and South Korea (7%).&lt;ref name=ipsos/&gt;

One quarter of men in Italy (25%) and Argentina (25%), and two in ten of those in Poland (21%) and France (19%), defined themselves as feminists. They were followed by those from Sweden (17%), Spain (16%), the United States (16%), Canada (15%), Great Britain (14%), Hungary (12%), Belgium (11%) and Australia (10%). Men least likely to identify this way were from South Korea (7%), Germany (3%) and Japan (3%).&lt;ref name=ipsos/&gt;

Women were more likely to self-identify as being feminists than men in every country in the study except for Poland, where 21% of men were and only 17% of women were likely to agree very much with the statement, and South Korea, where there was no difference between men and women (7%) on this measure.&lt;ref name=ipsos/&gt;

== Sexuality ==
{{Main|Feminist views on sexuality}}
[[Feminist views on sexuality]] vary, and have differed by historical period and by cultural context. Feminist attitudes to female sexuality have taken a few different directions. Matters such as the [[sex industry]], sexual representation in the media, and issues regarding consent to sex under conditions of male dominance have been particularly controversial among feminists. This debate has culminated in the late 1970s and the 1980s, in what came to be known as the [[feminist sex wars]], which pitted [[Anti-pornography movement|anti-pornography feminism]] against [[sex-positive feminism]], and parts of the feminist movement were deeply divided by these debates.&lt;ref name=Duggan /&gt;&lt;ref name=Hansen&gt;{{cite book |last1=Hansen |first1=Karen Tranberg |last2=Philipson |first2=Ilene J. |title=Women, class, and the feminist imagination: a socialist-feminist reader |year=1990 |publisher=Temple University Press |location=Philadelphia |isbn=978-0-87722-630-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Gerhard&gt;{{cite book |author=Gerhard, Jane F. |title=Desiring revolution: second-wave feminism and the rewriting of American sexual thought, 1920 to 1982 |year=2001 |publisher=Columbia University Press |location=New York |isbn=978-0-231-11204-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Leidholdt&gt;{{cite book |last1=Leidholdt |first1=Dorchen |authorlink=Dorchen Leidholdt |last2=Raymond |first2=Janice G. |title=The Sexual liberals and the attack on feminism |year=1990 |publisher=Pergamon Press |location=New York |isbn=978-0-08-037457-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Vance&gt;{{cite book |author=Vance, Carole S. |title=Pleasure and Danger: Exploring Female Sexuality |publisher=Thorsons Publishers|isbn=978-0-04-440593-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Feminists have taken a variety of positions on different aspects of the [[sexual revolution]] from the 1960s and 70s.

=== Sex industry ===
{{main|Sex industry|Feminist views on pornography|Feminist views on prostitution|Feminist sex wars| Male prostitution#Feminist studies}}
Opinions on the sex industry are diverse. Feminists critical of the sex industry generally see it as the exploitative result of patriarchal social structures which reinforce sexual and cultural attitudes complicit in rape and sexual harassment. Alternately, feminists who support at least part of the sex industry argue that it can be a medium of feminist expression and a means for women to take control of their sexuality. For the views of feminism on male prostitutes see the article on [[Male prostitution#Feminist studies|male prostitution]].

Feminist views of pornography range from condemnation of pornography as a form of [[violence against women]], to an embracing of some forms of pornography as a medium of feminist expression.&lt;ref name=Duggan&gt;{{cite book |author1=Duggan, Lisa |author2=Hunter, Nan D. |title=Sex wars: sexual dissent and political culture |year=1995 |publisher=Routledge |location=New York |isbn=978-0-415-91036-1 |pages=1–14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Hansen/&gt;&lt;ref name=Gerhard/&gt;&lt;ref name=Leidholdt/&gt;&lt;ref name=Vance/&gt; Similarly, feminists' views on prostitution vary, ranging from critical to supportive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=O'Neill |first=Maggie |year=2001 |title=Prostitution and Feminism |publisher=Polity Press |location=Cambridge |pages=14–16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Affirming female sexual autonomy ===
For feminists, a woman's right to control her own [[Right to sexuality|sexuality]] is a key issue. Feminists such as [[Catharine MacKinnon]] argue that women have very little control over their own bodies, with female sexuality being largely controlled and defined by men in patriarchal societies. Feminists argue that sexual violence committed by men is often rooted in ideologies of male sexual entitlement, and that these systems grant women very few legitimate options to refuse sexual advances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Rohana Ariffin|author2=Women's Crisis Centre (Pinang, Malaysia)|title=Shame, secrecy, and silence: study on rape in Penang|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HfsDAQAAIAAJ|accessdate=1 October 2011|year=1997|publisher=Women's Crisis Centre|isbn=978-983-99348-0-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bennett L, Manderson L, Astbury J.

University of Melbourne, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; In many{{clarify|date=June 2018}} cultures, men do not believe that a woman has the right to reject a man's sexual advances or to make an autonomous decision about participating in sex. Feminists argue that all cultures are, in one way or another, dominated by ideologies that largely deny women the right to decide how to express their sexuality, because men under patriarchy feel entitled to define sex on their own terms. This entitlement can take different forms, depending on the culture. In many{{clarify|date=June 2018}} parts of the world, especially in [[conservative]] and religious cultures, marriage is regarded as an institution which requires a wife to be sexually available at all times, virtually without limit; thus, forcing or coercing sex on a wife is not considered a crime or even an abusive behaviour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Jewkes R, Abrahams N |title= The epidemiology of rape and sexual coercion in South Africa: an overview|pmid=12365533|year=2002|volume=55|issue=7|pages=1231–44|journal=Social Science &amp; Medicine|doi=10.1016/s0277-9536(01)00242-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sen P. Ending the presumption of consent: nonconsensual sex in marriage. London, Centre for Health and Gender Equity, 1999&lt;/ref&gt; In more liberal cultures, this entitlement takes the form of a general [[sexualization]] of the whole culture. This is played out in the [[sexual objectification]] of women, with pornography and other forms of sexual entertainment creating the fantasy that all women exist solely for men's sexual pleasure, and that women are readily available and desiring to engage in sex at any time, with any man, on a man's terms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2006/apr/12/gender.politicsphilosophyandsociety |location=London |work=The Guardian |first=Stuart |last=Jeffries |title=Stuart Jeffries talks to leading feminist Catharine MacKinnon |date=2006-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lynn Hankinson Nelson notes that feminist empiricists find fundamental differences between the experiences of men and women. Thus, they seek to obtain knowledge through the examination of the experiences of women, and to "uncover the consequences of omitting, misdescribing, or devaluing them" to account for a range of human experience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Hankinson Nelson, Lynn |year=1990|title=Who Knows: from Quine To a Feminist Empiricism|publisher=Temple University Press|isbn=978-0-87722-647-5|page=30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another part of the feminist research agenda is the uncovering of ways in which power inequities are created or reinforced in society and in scientific and academic institutions.&lt;ref name="QCommRsrch"/&gt; Furthermore, despite calls for greater attention to be paid to structures of gender inequity in the academic literature, structural analyses of gender bias rarely appear in highly cited psychological journals, especially in the commonly studied areas of psychology and personality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Cortina |first1=L.

One criticism of feminist epistemology is that it allows social and political values to influence its findings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Hankinson Nelson, Lynn |year=1997|title=Feminism, Science, and the Philosophy of Science |publisher=Springer|isbn=978-0-7923-4611-1|page=61}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Susan Haack]] also points out that feminist epistemology reinforces traditional stereotypes about women's thinking (as intuitive and emotional, etc.); [[Meera Nanda]] further cautions that this may in fact trap women within "traditional gender roles and help justify patriarchy".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/feminism-epistemology/ |title=Feminist Epistemology and Philosophy of Science |author=Anderson, Elizabeth |accessdate=6 December 2011|year=2011 |journal=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy  |issue=Spring 2011 |editor=Edward N.

=== Feminist psychology ===

Feminism in psychology emerged as a critique of the dominant male outlook on psychological research where only male perspectives were studied with all male subjects.

Gender-based inquiries into and conceptualization of architecture have also come about, leading to [[Feminism and modern architecture|feminism in modern architecture]]. Piyush Mathur coined the term "archigenderic". Claiming that "architectural planning has an inextricable link with the defining and regulation of gender roles, responsibilities, rights, and limitations", Mathur came up with that term "to explore&amp;nbsp;... the meaning of 'architecture' in terms of gender" and "to explore the meaning of 'gender' in terms of architecture".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1080/09699089800200034 |title=The archigenderic territories: Mansfield park and a handful of dust |year=1998 |last1=Mathur |first1=Piyush |journal=Women's Writing |volume=5 |issue=1 |pages=71–81}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Businesses ===
Feminist activists have established a range of [[feminist businesses]], including women's bookstores, feminist credit unions, feminist presses, feminist mail-order catalogs, and feminist restaurants. These businesses flourished as part of the [[Second-wave feminism|second]] and [[Third-wave feminism|third-waves]] of feminism in the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s.{{sfnp|Echols|1989|pp=269–278}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Feminist Bookstore Movement: Lesbian Antiracism and Feminist Accountability|last=Hogan|first=Kristen|publisher=Duke University Press|year=2016|isbn=|location=Durham, North Carolina|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The feminist movement produced feminist fiction, feminist non-fiction, and feminist poetry, which created new interest in [[Women's writing (literary category)|women's writing]]. It also prompted a general reevaluation of women's [[Women's history|historical]] and academic contributions in response to the belief that women's lives and contributions have been underrepresented as areas of scholarly interest.&lt;ref name=Blain&gt;{{cite book |author=Blain, Virginia |author2=Clements, Patricia |author3=Grundy, Isobel  |title=The feminist companion to literature in English: women writers from the Middle Ages to the present |year=1990 |publisher=Yale University Press |location=New Haven |isbn=978-0-300-04854-4 |pages=vii–x}}&lt;/ref&gt; There has also been a close link between feminist literature and [[activism]], with feminist writing typically voicing key concerns or ideas of feminism in a particular era.

Much of the early period of feminist literary scholarship was given over to the rediscovery and reclamation of texts written by women. In Western feminist literary scholarship, Studies like [[Dale Spender]]'s ''Mothers of the Novel'' (1986) and Jane Spencer's ''The Rise of the Woman Novelist'' (1986) were ground-breaking in their insistence that women have always been writing.

Commensurate with this growth in scholarly interest, various presses began the task of reissuing long-out-of-print texts. [[Virago Press]] began to publish its large list of 19th and early-20th-century novels in 1975 and became one of the first commercial presses to join in the project of reclamation. In the 1980s Pandora Press, responsible for publishing Spender's study, issued a companion line of 18th-century novels written by women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Sandra M. |last=Gilbert |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A0DE4DD1E3AF937A35756C0A960948260 |title=Paperbacks: From Our Mothers' Libraries: women who created the novel |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=4 May 1986}}&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, [[Broadview Press]] continues to issue 18th- and 19th-century novels, many hitherto out of print, and the [[University of Kentucky]] has a series of republications of early women's novels.

Particular works of literature have come to be known as key feminist texts. ''[[A Vindication of the Rights of Woman]]'' (1792) by [[Mary Wollstonecraft]], is one of the earliest works of feminist philosophy. ''[[A Room of One's Own]]'' (1929) by [[Virginia Woolf]], is noted in its argument for both a literal and figural space for women writers within a literary tradition dominated by patriarchy.

The widespread interest in women's writing is related to a general reassessment and expansion of the [[literary canon]]. Interest in [[post-colonial literature]]s, [[LGBT literature|gay and lesbian literature]], writing by people of colour, working people's writing, and the cultural productions of other historically marginalized groups has resulted in a whole scale expansion of what is considered "literature", and genres hitherto not regarded as "literary", such as children's writing, journals, letters, travel writing, and many others are now the subjects of scholarly interest.&lt;ref name="Blain" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor1-last=Buck |editor1-first=Claire |title=The Bloomsbury Guide to Women's Literature |publisher=Prentice Hall |year=1992 |page=vix}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Salzman |first=Paul |chapter=Introduction |title=Early Modern Women's Writing |publisher=Oxford UP |year=2000 |pages=ix–x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most [[Literary genre|genres and subgenres]] have undergone a similar analysis, so literary studies has entered new territories such as the "[[Gothic fiction#The female Gothic and the supernatural explained|female gothic]]"&lt;ref&gt;Term coined by Ellen Moers in ''Literary Women: The Great Writers'' (New York: Doubleday, 1976). See also Juliann E. Fleenor, ed., ''The Female Gothic'' (Montreal: Eden Press, 1983) and Gary Kelly, ed., ''Varieties of Female Gothic'' 6 Vols. (London: Pickering &amp; Chatto, 2002).&lt;/ref&gt; or [[Women in science fiction|women's science fiction]].

According to Elyce Rae Helford, "Science fiction and fantasy serve as important vehicles for feminist thought, particularly as bridges between theory and practice."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Helford, Elyce Rae |editor-first=Gary |editor-last=Westfahl |title=The Greenwood Encyclopedia of Science Fiction and Fantasy |chapter=Feminist Science Fiction |year=2005 |publisher=Greenwood Press |isbn=978-0-300-04854-4 |pages=289–291}}&lt;/ref&gt; Feminist science fiction is sometimes taught at the university level to explore the role of social constructs in understanding gender.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1207/s15328023top1703_17 |title=Using Science Fiction to Teach the Psychology of Sex and Gender |year=1990 |last1=Lips |first1=Hilary M. |journal=Teaching of Psychology |volume=17 |issue=3 |pages=197–98}}&lt;/ref&gt; Notable texts of this kind are [[Ursula K.

Feminist nonfiction has played an important role in voicing concerns about women's lived experiences. For example, [[Maya Angelou]]'s ''[[I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings|I Know Why The Caged Bird Sings]]'' was extremely influential, as it represented the specific racism and sexism experienced by black women growing up in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://feminisminindia.com/2018/08/10/i-know-why-the-caged-bird-sings-review-maya-angelou/|title=I Know Why The Caged Bird Sings: Angelou's Quest to Truth and Power|last=Shah|first=Mahvish|date=2018|website=Feminism in India|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, many feminist movements have embraced [[poetry]] as a vehicle through which to communicate feminist ideas to public audiences through anthologies, poetry collections, and public readings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.poetryfoundation.org/articles/144696/a-change-of-world|title=A Change of World|last=Poetry Foundation|date=2018-11-29|website=Poetry Foundation|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Feminism became a principal concern of [[Musicology|musicologists]] in the 1980s&lt;ref name=mus&gt;Beard, David; Gload, Kenneth. 2005. Musicology : The Key Concepts. London and New York: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt; as part of the [[New Musicology]]. Prior to this, in the 1970s, musicologists were beginning to discover women composers and performers, and had begun to review concepts of [[Western canon|canon]], genius, genre and periodization from a feminist perspective. In other words, the question of how women musicians fit into traditional music history was now being asked.&lt;ref name=mus/&gt; Through the 1980s and 1990s, this trend continued as musicologists like [[Susan McClary]], [[Marcia Citron]] and Ruth Solie began to consider the cultural reasons for the marginalizing of women from the received body of work. Concepts such as music as gendered discourse; professionalism; reception of women's music; examination of the sites of music production; relative wealth and [[Female education|education of women]]; popular music studies in relation to women's identity; patriarchal ideas in music analysis; and notions of gender and difference are among the themes examined during this time.&lt;ref name=mus/&gt;

While the [[music industry]] has long been open to having women in performance or entertainment roles, women are much less likely to have positions of authority, such as being the [[Conducting|leader of an orchestra]].&lt;ref name="theguardian.com"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/feb/28/why-male-domination-of-classical-music-might-end |title=Why the male domination of classical music might be coming to an end|first=Jessica |last=Duchen |work=[[The Guardian]] |date=28 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In popular music, while there are many women singers recording songs, there are very few women behind the [[Audio mixer|audio console]] acting as [[Record producer|music producers]], the individuals who direct and manage the recording process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Rosina |last=Ncube |title=Sounding Off: Why So Few Women in Audio? |website=Sound on Sound |date=September 2013 |url=http://www.soundonsound.com/people/sounding-why-so-few-women-audio}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cinema===
{{main|Feminist film theory}}
{{see also|Women's cinema}}

Feminist cinema, advocating or illustrating feminist perspectives, arose largely with the development of [[feminist film theory]] in the late '60s and early '70s. Women who were radicalized during the 1960s by political debate and sexual liberation; but the failure of radicalism to produce substantive change for women galvanized them to form consciousness-raising groups and set about analysing, from different perspectives, dominant cinema's construction of women.&lt;ref&gt;Hayward S., ''Cinema Studies – The Key Concepts'', 3rd edn, Routledge, 2006;134–5.&lt;/ref&gt; Differences were particularly marked between [[Feminist film theory#History|feminists on either side of the Atlantic]]. 1972 saw the first feminist film festivals in the U.S. and U.K. as well as the first feminist film journal, [[List of film periodicals|''Women and Film'']]. Trailblazers from this period included [[Claire Johnston]] and [[Laura Mulvey]], who also organized the Women's Event at the [[Edinburgh International Film Festival|Edinburgh Film Festival]].&lt;ref&gt;Erens, P., ''Issues in Feminist Film Criticism'', Wiley &amp; Sons, 1991; 270.&lt;/ref&gt; Other theorists making a powerful impact on feminist film include [[Teresa de Lauretis]], Anneke Smelik and [[Kaja Silverman]]. Approaches in philosophy and psychoanalysis fuelled feminist film criticism, feminist independent film and feminist distribution.

It has been argued that there are two distinct approaches to independent, theoretically inspired feminist filmmaking. 'Deconstruction' concerns itself with analysing and breaking down codes of mainstream cinema, aiming to create a different relationship between the spectator and dominant cinema. The second approach, a feminist counterculture, embodies feminine writing to investigate a specifically feminine cinematic language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor1-last=Kuhn |editor1-first=A. |editor2-last=Radstone |editor2-first=S. |title=Women's Companion to International Film |publisher=Virago |year=1990 |page=153}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some recent criticism&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2013/11/what-really-makes-a-film-feminist/281402/ |title=What really makes a feminist film? |work=[[The Atlantic]] |first=Holly L. |last=Derr |date=13 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; of "feminist film" approaches has centred around a Swedish rating system called the [[Bechdel test]].

Prentice-Hall 1996;416.&lt;/ref&gt; Since then female directors such as [[Sally Potter]], [[Catherine Breillat]], [[Claire Denis]] and [[Jane Campion]] have made art movies, and directors like [[Kathryn Bigelow]] and [[Patty Jenkins]] have had mainstream success. This progress stagnated in the 90s, and men outnumber women five to one in behind the camera roles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2018/01/the-brutal-math-of-gender-inequality-in-hollywood/550232/ |title=The Brutal Math of Gender Inequality in Hollywood |work=The Atlantic |date=11 January 2018|author=Derek Thompson}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://namesorts.com/2014/04/16/assessing-the-gender-gap-in-the-film-industry|title=Assessing the Gender Gap in the Film Industry|publisher=NamSor Blog|date=2014-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Feminism had complex interactions with the major political movements of the twentieth century.

=== Socialism ===
{{main|Left-wing politics#Social progressivism and counterculture|l1=Social Progressivism and Counterculture}}
Since the late nineteenth century some feminists have allied with socialism, whereas others have criticized socialist ideology for being insufficiently concerned about women's rights. [[August Bebel]], an early activist of the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|German Social Democratic Party]] (SPD), published his work ''Die Frau und der Sozialismus'', juxtaposing the struggle for equal rights between sexes with social equality in general. In 1907 there was an [[International Socialist Women's Conferences#Stuttgart 1907|International Conference of Socialist Women]] in [[Stuttgart]] where suffrage was described as a tool of class struggle. [[Clara Zetkin]] of the SPD called for women's suffrage to build a "''socialist order, the only one that allows for a radical solution to the women's question''".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Badia, Gilbert |title=Zetkin. Femminista senza frontiere |year=1994 |publisher=University of Michigan. |isbn=978-88-85378-53-7 |page=320}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="hww5"/&gt;

In Britain, the women's movement was allied with the [[Labour party (UK)|Labour party]]. In the U.S., [[Betty Friedan]] emerged from a radical background to take leadership. [[Radical Women]] is the oldest socialist feminist organization in the U.S. and is still active.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=The Radical Women Manifesto: Socialist Feminist Theory, Program and Organizational Structure |year=2001 |publisher=Red Letter Press |location=Seattle, WA |isbn=978-0-932323-11-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Spanish Civil War]], [[Dolores Ibárruri]] (''La Pasionaria'') led the [[Communist Party of Spain (main)|Communist Party of Spain]]. Although she supported equal rights for women, she opposed women fighting on the front and clashed with the [[Anarcha-Feminism|anarcha-feminist]] [[Mujeres Libres]].&lt;ref name="Ib"&gt;{{Cite book |author=Ibárruri, Dolores |title=Speeches &amp; Articles, 1936–1938 |year=1938 |publisher=University of Michigan |page=263}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Feminists in Ireland in the early 20th century included the [[revolutionary]] [[Irish Republicanism|Irish Republican]], [[suffragette]] and [[Socialism|socialist]] [[Constance Markievicz]] who in 1918 was the first woman elected to the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|British House of Commons]]. However, in line with Sinn Féin [[abstentionism|abstentionist]] policy, she would not take her seat in the House of Commons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irishresistancebooks.com/internment/intern6.htm|title=Internment – Women Internees 1916–1973|author=John McGuffin|year=1973

=== Fascism ===
{{further|Fascism and ideology|Women in Nazi Germany}}
[[File:Feministas en lucha anti Pinochet (de Kena Lorenzini).jpg|thumb|Chilean feminists protest against the regime of [[Augusto Pinochet]]]]
Fascism has been prescribed dubious stances on feminism by its practitioners and by women's groups. Amongst other demands concerning social reform presented in the [[Fascist manifesto]] in 1919 was expanding the suffrage to all Italian citizens of age 18 and above, including women (accomplished only in 1946, after the defeat of fascism) and eligibility for all to stand for office from age 25. This demand was particularly championed by special Fascist women's auxiliary groups such as the ''fasci femminilli'' and only partly realized in 1925, under pressure from dictator [[Benito Mussolini]]'s more conservative coalition partners.&lt;ref name="hagg"&gt;{{cite book |last=Hägg |first=Göran |year=2008 |title=Mussolini: En studie i makt |trans-title=A study in power |language=sv |publisher=Norstedt |location=Stockholm |isbn=978-91-1-301949-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="passmore"&gt;{{cite book |last=Passmore |first=Kevin |authorlink=Definitions_of_fascism#Kevin_Passmore |year=2003 |title=Women, Gender and Fascism in Europe, 1919–45 |publisher=Rutgers Univ.

Cyprian Blamires states that although feminists were among those who opposed the rise of [[Adolf Hitler]], feminism has a complicated relationship with the [[Nazi]] movement as well. While Nazis glorified traditional notions of patriarchal society and its role for women, they claimed to recognize women's equality in employment.&lt;ref name=Blamires&gt;{{cite book |title=World Fascism: A Historical Encyclopedia |last=Blamires |first=Cyprian |volume=1 |publisher=ABC-CLIO |isbn=978-1-57607-940-9 |pages=232–33|year=2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Hitler and Mussolini declared themselves as opposed to feminism,&lt;ref name=Blamires/&gt; and after the rise of [[Nazism]] in Germany in 1933, there was a rapid dissolution of the political rights and economic opportunities that feminists had fought for during the pre-war period and to some extent during the 1920s.&lt;ref name=hww5/&gt; Georges Duby et al. note that in practice fascist society was hierarchical and emphasized male virility, with women maintaining a largely subordinate position.&lt;ref name=hww5&gt;{{cite book |last1=Duby |first1=Georges |last2=Perrot |first2=Michelle |last3=Schmitt Pantel |first3=Pauline |title=A history of women in the West |year=1994 |publisher=Belknap Press of Harvard University Press |location=Cambridge, Massachusetts |isbn=978-0-674-40369-7 |page=600}}&lt;/ref&gt; Blamires also notes that Neofascism has since the 1960s been hostile towards feminism and advocates that women accept "their traditional roles".&lt;ref name=Blamires/&gt;

=== Civil rights movement and anti-racism ===
The [[civil rights movement]] has influenced and informed the feminist movement and vice versa. Many Western feminists adapted the language and theories of black equality activism and drew parallels between women's rights and the rights of non-white people.&lt;ref name="Levy"&gt;{{cite book |last=Levy |first=Peter |year=1998 |title=The Civil Rights Movement |publisher=Greenwood Press |location=Westport, Conn. |isbn=978-0-313-29854-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the connections between the women's and civil rights movements, some tension arose during the late 1960s and early 1970s as non-white women argued that feminism was predominantly white and middle class, and did not understand and was not concerned with race issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Code |first=Lorraine |title=Encyclopedia of Feminist Theories |chapter=Civil rights |publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis |year=2000 |isbn=978-0-415-13274-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, some women argued that the civil rights movement had sexist elements and did not adequately address minority women's concerns.&lt;ref name="Levy" /&gt; These criticisms created new feminist social theories about the intersections of racism, [[classism]], and [[sexism]], and new feminisms, such as [[black feminism]] and [[Chicana feminism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Roth |first=Benita |title=Separate Roads to Feminism: Black, Chicana, and White feminist movements in America's second wave |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=2004 |isbn=978-0-521-52972-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Winddance Twine |first1=France |first2=Kathleen M. |last2=Blee |title=Feminism and Antiracism: International struggles for justice |publisher=NYU Press |year=2001 |isbn=978-0-8147-9855-3}}{{page needed|date=October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Neoliberalism===
[[Neoliberalism]] has been criticized by feminist theory for having a negative effect on the female workforce population across the globe, especially in the global south.  Masculinist assumptions and objectives continue to dominate economic and geopolitical thinking.&lt;ref name="Peterson"&gt;{{cite book |last=Peterson |first=V. Spike |year=2014 |chapter=International/Global Political Economy |editor-last=Shepherd | editor-first=Laura J. |title=Gender Matters in Global Politics |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=C2AKBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT291 |edition=2 |publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781134752591 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|177}} Women's experiences in non-industrialized countries reveal often deleterious effects of modernization policies and undercut orthodox claims that development benefits everyone.&lt;ref name="Peterson"/&gt;{{rp|175}}

Proponents of neoliberalism have theorized that by increasing women's participation in the workforce, there will be heightened economic progress, but feminist critics have noted that this participation alone does not further equality in gender relations.&lt;ref name="elias"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Elias |first1=Juanita |last2=Ferguson |first2=Lucy |year=2014 |chapter=Production, Employment, and Consumption |editor-last=Shepherd | editor-first=Laura J. |title=Gender Matters in Global Politics |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=C2AKBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT291 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=9781134752591 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|186–98}} Neoliberalism has failed to address significant problems such as the devaluation of feminized labour, the structural privileging of men and masculinity, and the politicization of women's subordination in the family and the workplace.&lt;ref name="Peterson"/&gt;{{rp|176}} The "feminization of employment" refers to a conceptual characterization of deteriorated and devalorized labour conditions that are less desirable, meaningful, safe and secure.&lt;ref name="Peterson"/&gt;{{rp|179}}  Employers in the global south have perceptions about feminine labour and seek workers who are perceived to be undemanding, docile and willing to accept low wages.&lt;ref name="Peterson"/&gt;{{rp|180}}  Social constructs about feminized labour have played a big part in this, for instance, employers often perpetuate ideas about women as 'secondary income earners to justify their lower rates of pay and not deserving of training or promotion.&lt;ref name="elias"/&gt;{{rp|189}}

== Societal impact ==
{{Main|Feminist effects on society}}
The feminist movement has effected change in Western society, including women's suffrage; greater access to education; more nearly equitable pay with men; the right to initiate divorce proceedings; the right of women to make individual decisions regarding pregnancy (including access to contraceptives and abortion); and the right to own property.&lt;ref name="Messer-Davidow"/&gt;

From the 1960s on, the campaign for women's rights&lt;ref name="quarterly"&gt;{{Cite book |author=Lockwood, Bert B. |title=Women's Rights: A Human Rights Quarterly Reader |year=2006 |publisher=The Johns Hopkins University Press |isbn=978-0-8018-8374-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; was met with mixed results&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jofreeman.com/feminism/suffrage.htm |title=FROM SUFFRAGE TO WOMEN'S LIBERATION: FEMINISM IN TWENTIETH CENTURY AMERICA by Jo Freeman}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the U.S. and the U.K. Other countries of the [[European Economic Community|EEC]] agreed to ensure that discriminatory laws would be phased out across the European Community.

Some feminist campaigning also helped reform attitudes to [[child sexual abuse]]. The view that young girls cause men to have sexual intercourse with them was replaced by that of men's responsibility for their own conduct, the men being adults.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Rush |first=Florence |authorlink=Florence Rush |year=1988 |title=The Best Kept Secret: Sexual Abuse of Children |publisher=Prentice-Hall |location=Englewood Cliffs |isbn=978-0070542235}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the U.S., the [[National Organization for Women]] ([[National Organization for Women|NOW]]) began in 1966 to seek women's equality, including through the [[Equal Rights Amendment]] ([[Equal Rights Amendment|ERA]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://now.org/about/history/statement-of-purpose/|title=The National Organization for Women's 1966 Statement of Purpose}}&lt;/ref&gt; which did not pass, although [[Equal Rights Amendment#State constitutions|some states enacted their own]]. [[Reproductive rights]] in the U.S. centred on the court decision in [[Roe v. Wade|''Roe'' v. ''Wade'']] enunciating a woman's right to choose whether to carry a pregnancy to term. Western women gained more reliable [[birth control]], allowing family planning and careers. The movement started in the 1910s in the U.S. under [[Margaret Sanger]] and elsewhere under [[Marie Stopes]]. In the final three decades of the 20th century, Western women knew a new freedom through [[birth control]], which enabled women to plan their adult lives, often making way for both career and family.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.u-s-history.com/pages/h1676.html|title=Margaret Sanger}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[division of labor|division of labour]] within households was affected by the increased entry of women into workplaces in the 20th century. Sociologist [[Arlie Russell Hochschild]] found that, in two-career couples, men and women, on average, spend about equal amounts of time working, but women still spend more time on housework,&lt;ref name="Hochschild1"&gt;{{Cite book |author=Hochschild, Arlie Russell |author2=Machung, Anne |title=The Second Shift |year=2003 |publisher=Penguin Books |location=New York  |isbn=978-0-14-200292-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hochschild2"&gt;{{Cite book |author=Hochschild, Arlie Russell |title=The Time Bind: When Work Becomes Home and Home Becomes Work |year=2001 |publisher=Henry Holt &amp; Co. |location=New York  |isbn=978-0-8050-6643-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; although [[Cathy Young]] responded by arguing that women may prevent equal participation by men in housework and parenting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.salon.com/2000/06/12/gatekeeping/|title=The Mama Lion at the Gate |accessdate=17 December 2015 |publisher=Salon.com |author=Young, Cathy |authorlink=Cathy Young}}&lt;/ref&gt; Judith K. Brown writes, "Women are most likely to make a substantial contribution when subsistence activities have the following characteristics: the participant is not obliged to be far from home; the tasks are relatively monotonous and do not require rapt concentration; and the work is not dangerous, can be performed in spite of interruptions, and is easily resumed once interrupted."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | first = Judith K. | last = Brown | title = A Note on the Division of Labor by Sex | date = October 1970 | volume = 72 | issue = 5 | pages = 1073–78 | journal = [[American Anthropologist]] | doi=10.1525/aa.1970.72.5.02a00070}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In international law, the ''[[Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women]]'' (CEDAW) is an international convention adopted by the [[United Nations General Assembly]] and described as an international [[bill of rights]] for women. It came into force in those nations ratifying it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ohchr.org/EN/ProfessionalInterest/Pages/CEDAW.aspx|title=Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women New York, 18 December 1979 |publisher=Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights|accessdate=31 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Jurisprudence ===
{{Main|Feminist legal theory}}

Feminist jurisprudence is a branch of [[jurisprudence]] that examines the relationship between women and law. It addresses questions about the history of legal and social biases against women and about the enhancement of their legal rights.&lt;ref name="blacks"&gt;{{cite book |year=2014 |editor-last=Garner |editor-first=Bryan |editor-link=Bryan A. Garner |title=Black's Law Dictionary |edition=10th |location=St. Paul, Minn. |publisher=Thomson Reuters |page=985 |isbn=978-0-314-61300-4 |quote=Feminist jurisprudence examines ... the history of legal and social biases against women, the elimination of those biases in modern law, and the enhancement of women's legal rights and recognition [status] in society.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Feminist jurisprudence signifies a reaction to the [[Philosophy of law|philosophical approach]] of modern [[Law#Legal theory|legal scholars]], who typically see law as a process for interpreting and perpetuating a society's universal, gender-neutral ideals. Feminist legal scholars claim that this fails to acknowledge women's values or legal interests or the harms that they may anticipate or experience.&lt;ref name="minda"&gt;{{cite book |last=Minda |first=Gary |year=1995 |title=Postmodern Legal Movements: Law and Jurisprudence at Century's End |publisher=[[New York University Press|NYU Press]] |location=N.Y.C. |isbn=978-0814755105 |pages=129–30 |quote=Feminist legal scholars, despite their differences, appear united in claiming that 'masculine' jurisprudence ... fails to acknowledge, let alone respond to, the interests, values, fears, and harms experienced by women.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Language ===
{{details|Gender-neutral language in English}}
Proponents of gender-neutral language argue that the use of gender-specific language often implies male superiority or reflects an unequal state of society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Miller |first1=Casey |authorlink1=Casey Miller |last2=Swift |first2=Kate |authorlink2=Kate Swift |year=1988 |title=The Handbook of Nonsexist Writing |publisher=Harper &amp; Row |location=N.Y.C. |isbn=978-0061816024 |pages=45, 64, 66}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to ''The Handbook of English Linguistics'', generic masculine pronouns and gender-specific job titles are instances "where English linguistic convention has historically treated men as prototypical of the human species."&lt;ref name="handbook linguistics"&gt;{{cite book |year=2006 |editor1-last=Aarts |editor1-first=Bas |editor2-last=McMahon |editor2-first=April |title=The Handbook of English Linguistics |location=Malden, Mass. |publisher=Blackwell |isbn=978-1405113823}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Feminist theology is a movement that reconsiders the traditions, practices, scriptures, and theologies of religions from a feminist perspective. Some of the goals of feminist theology include increasing the role of women among the clergy and religious authorities, reinterpreting male-dominated imagery and language about God, determining women's place in relation to career and motherhood, and studying images of women in the religion's sacred texts.&lt;ref name=Bundesen&gt;{{cite book |author=Bundesen, Lynne |title=The Feminine Spirit: Recapturing the Heart of Scripture |publisher=Jossey-Bass |isbn=978-0-7879-8495-3|date=2007-03-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Christian feminism]] is a branch of feminist theology which seeks to interpret and understand Christianity in light of the [[Christian egalitarianism|equality]] of [[Women in Christianity|women]] and men, and that this interpretation is necessary for a complete understanding of Christianity. While there is no standard set of beliefs among Christian feminists, most agree that God does not discriminate on the basis of sex, and are involved in issues such as the [[ordination of women]], male dominance and the balance of parenting in [[Christian views on marriage|Christian marriage]], claims of moral deficiency and inferiority of women compared to men, and the overall treatment of women in the church.&lt;ref name=Haddad&gt;{{cite journal |author=Haddad, Mimi |title=Egalitarian Pioneers: Betty Friedan or Catherine Booth? |journal=Priscilla Papers |volume=20 |issue=4 |date=2006 |url=http://www.cbeinternational.org/sites/default/files/pp204_10ep.pdf |format=[[Portable Document Format|PDF]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150713193304/http://www.cbeinternational.org/sites/default/files/pp204_10ep.pdf |archivedate=13 July 2015  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=andeson&gt;{{cite book |author=Anderson, Pamela Sue |author2=Clack, Beverley |title=Feminist philosophy of religion: critical readings |year=2004 |publisher=Routledge |location=London |isbn=978-0-415-25749-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Christian [[Women in the Bible|Bible refers to women]] in positions of authority in [[Book of Judges|Judges]] 4:4 and [[Books of Kings|Kings]] 22:14.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Judges|4:4|NASB}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse|2|Kings|22:14|NASB}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Primary inline|date=April 2016}}

[[Islamic feminism|Islamic feminists]] advocate women's rights, [[gender equality]], and [[social justice]] grounded within an Islamic framework. Advocates seek to highlight the deeply rooted teachings of equality in the [[Women in the Quran|Quran]] and encourage a questioning of the patriarchal interpretation of Islamic teaching through the Quran, ''[[hadith]]'' (sayings of [[Muhammad]]), and ''[[Sharia#Women|sharia]]'' (law) towards the creation of a more equal and just society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.feministezine.com/feminist/international/Islamic-Feminism-01.html|title=Islamic Feminism: What's in a Name?|author=Badran, Margot |accessdate=17 December 2015 |date=17–23 January 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although rooted in Islam, the movement's pioneers have also utilized [[Islam and secularism|secular]] and Western feminist discourses and recognize the role of Islamic feminism as part of an integrated global feminist movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.feminismeislamic.org/eng/index.htm|publisher=feminismeislamic.org |author=Catalonian Islamic Board |title=II International Congress on Islamic Feminism|accessdate=9 July 2008 |date=24–27 October 2008|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070114144940/http://www.feminismeislamic.org/eng/index.htm|archivedate=14 January 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Buddhist feminism]] is a movement that seeks to improve the religious, legal, and [[social status]] of [[Women in Buddhism|women within Buddhism]]. It is an aspect of [[feminist theology]] which seeks to advance and understand the equality of men and women morally, socially, spiritually, and in leadership from a Buddhist perspective. The Buddhist feminist [[Rita Gross]] describes Buddhist feminism as "the radical practice of the co-humanity of women and men."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Buddhism After Patriarchy: A Feminist History, Analysis, and Reconstruction of Buddhism|last= Gross|first= Rita M.|year= 1992|publisher= [[State University of New York Press]]|location= Albany, New York|isbn= 978-0-7914-1403-3|page= 127|accessdate=7 October 2012 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=B3eurUjHo1IC&amp;pg=PA127 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jewish feminism]] is a movement that seeks to improve the religious, legal, and social status of [[Women in Judaism|women]] within Judaism and to open up new opportunities for religious experience and leadership for Jewish women. The main issues for early Jewish feminists in these movements were the exclusion from the all-male prayer group or ''[[minyan]]'', the exemption from positive time-bound ''[[Mitzvah|mitzvot]]'', and women's inability to function as witnesses and to initiate [[Jewish view of marriage#Divorce|divorce]].&lt;ref name=Plaskow1997&gt;{{cite book |author=Plaskow, Judith |editor=Frank, Daniel H. |others=Leaman, Oliver |title=History of Jewish philosophy |year=2003 |publisher=Routledge |location=London |isbn=978-0-415-32469-4 |chapter=Jewish Feminist Thought}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many Jewish women have become leaders of feminist movements throughout their history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Forward Magazine |title= Why are there so many Jewish feminists? |author= Marjorie Ingall |url= http://forward.com/articles/2305/why-are-there-so-many-jewish-feminists/ |date= 18 November 2005 |accessdate= 31 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Patriarchy is a social system in which society is organized around male authority figures. In this system fathers have authority over women, children, and property. It implies the institutions of male rule and privilege, and is dependent on female subordination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of sex and gender |year=2007 |publisher=Macmillan Reference |location=Detroit, Mich.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most forms of feminism characterize patriarchy as an unjust social system that is oppressive to women. [[Carole Pateman]] argues that the patriarchal distinction "between masculinity and femininity is the political difference between freedom and subjection."&lt;ref&gt;Pateman, Carole (1988). ''The Sexual Contract'', Stanford: Stanford University Press, p. 207.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[feminist theory]] the concept of patriarchy often includes all the social mechanisms that reproduce and exert male dominance over women. Feminist theory typically characterizes patriarchy as a social construction, which can be overcome by revealing and critically analyzing its manifestations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Tickner, Ann J.|chapter=Patriarchy|title=Routledge Encyclopedia of International Political Economy: Entries PZ|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|year=2001|isbn=978-0-415-24352-0|pages=1197–98|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lSmU3aXWIAYC&amp;pg=PA1197}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some [[radical feminism|radical feminists]] have proposed that because patriarchy is too deeply rooted in society, [[Separatist feminism|separatism]] is the only viable solution.&lt;ref&gt;Sarah Hoagland, Lesbian Ethics: toward new value&lt;/ref&gt; Other feminists have criticized these views as being anti-men.&lt;ref&gt;Friedan, Betty.

=== Men and masculinity ===
{{main|Men and feminism}}
Feminist theory has explored the social construction of masculinity and its implications for the goal of gender equality. The social construct of masculinity is seen by feminism as problematic because it associates males with aggression and competition, and reinforces patriarchal and unequal gender relations.&lt;ref name="Faludi" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Tong |first=Rosemarie Putnam |title=Feminist Thought: A More Comprehensive Introduction |location=Boulder, Colo. |publisher=Westview Press |edition=2nd |year=1998 |isbn=978-0-8133-3295-6 |page=70}}&lt;/ref&gt; Patriarchal cultures are criticized for "limiting forms of masculinity" available to men and thus narrowing their life choices.&lt;ref name="Gardiner"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Gardiner |first1=Judith Kegan |title=Masculinity studies and feminist theory |publisher=Columbia University Press |year=2002 |isbn=978-0-231-12278-8 |pages =96, 153}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some feminists are engaged with men's issues activism, such as bringing attention to male rape and spousal battery and addressing negative social expectations for men.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Uviller | first1 = Rena K. | year = 1978 | title = Fathers' Rights and Feminism: The Maternal Presumption Revisited | url = | journal = Harv.

However, some argue that while male engagement with feminism is necessary, it is problematic because of the ingrained social influences of patriarchy in gender relations.&lt;ref&gt;Jardine, Alice, Paul Smith, ''Men in feminism '', {{ISBN|0-415-90251-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The consensus today in feminist and masculinity theories is that men and women should cooperate to achieve the larger goals of feminism.&lt;ref name="Gardiner" /&gt; It has been proposed that, in large part, this can be achieved through considerations of women's [[Agency (sociology)|agency]].&lt;ref name=coerced_parenthood /&gt;

== Reactions ==
Different groups of people have responded to feminism, and both men and women have been among its supporters and critics. Among American university students, for both men and women, support for feminist ideas is more common than self-identification as a feminist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1471-6402.2004.00159.x |title=Disavowing Social Identities: What It Means when Women Say, 'I'm Not a Feminist, but&amp;nbsp;...' |year=2004 |last1=Zucker |first1=Alyssa N. |journal=Psychology of Women Quarterly |volume=28 |issue=4 |pages=423–35}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1023/A:1007044802798 |year=2000 |last1=Burn |first1=Shawn Meghan |last2=Aboud |first2=Roger |last3=Moyles |first3=Carey |title=The Relationship Between Gender Social Identity and Support for Feminism |journal=[[Sex Roles (journal)|Sex Roles]] |volume=42 |issue=11/12 |pages=1081–89}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/BF00289954 |title=New wave or second stage?

=== Pro-feminism ===
{{main|Pro-feminism}}
Pro-feminism is the support of feminism without implying that the supporter is a member of the feminist movement. The term is most often used in reference to men who are actively supportive of feminism. The activities of pro-feminist men's groups include anti-violence work with boys and young men in schools, offering sexual harassment workshops in workplaces, running community education campaigns, and counselling male perpetrators of violence. Pro-feminist men also may be involved in men's health, activism against pornography including anti-pornography legislation, [[men's studies]], and the development of gender equity curricula in schools. This work is sometimes in collaboration with feminists and women's services, such as domestic violence and rape crisis centres.&lt;ref name=Lingard&gt;{{Cite book |last1=Lingard |first1=Bob |last2=Douglas |first2=Peter |title=Men Engaging Feminisms: Pro-Feminism, Backlashes and Schooling |year=1999 |publisher=Open University Press |location=Buckingham, England |isbn=978-0-335-19818-4 |page=192}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kimmel-Tide"&gt;{{Cite book |last1=Kimmel |first1=Michael S. |authorlink1=Michael Kimmel |last2=Mosmiller |first2=Thomas E. |title=Against the Tide: Pro-Feminist Men in the United States, 1776–1990: A Documentary History |year=1992 |publisher=Beacon Press |location=Boston |isbn=978-0-8070-6767-3}}{{page needed|date=October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Anti-feminism and criticism of feminism===

{{main|Antifeminism}}
Anti-feminism is opposition to feminism in some or all of its forms.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last1 = Simpson | first1 = John A. | last2 = Weiner | first2 = Edmund S.C. | author-link1 = John Simpson (lexicographer) | author-link2 = Edmund Weiner | contribution = Anti-feminist | editor-last1 = Simpson | editor-first1 = John A. | editor-last2 = Weiner | editor-first2 = Edmund S.

In the nineteenth century, anti-feminism was mainly focused on opposition to women's suffrage. Later, opponents of women's entry into institutions of higher learning argued that education was too great a physical burden on women. Other anti-feminists opposed women's entry into the labour force, or their right to join unions, to sit on juries, or to obtain birth control and control of their sexuality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jWj5OBvTh1IC&amp;pg=PA35 |chapter=Antifeminism |first=Michael |last=Kimmel |authorlink=Michael Kimmel | editor-last1 = Kimmel | editor-first1 = Michael | editor-last2 = Aronson | editor-first2 = Amy | editor-link1 = Michael Kimmel | editor-link2 = Amy Aronson | title = Men and masculinities a social, cultural, and historical encyclopedia | pages = 35–37 | publisher = ABC-CLIO | location = Santa Barbara, California | year = 2004 | isbn = 9781576077740 | ref = harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some people have opposed feminism on the grounds that they believe it is contrary to traditional values or religious beliefs. These anti-feminists argue, for example, that social acceptance of divorce and non-married women is wrong and harmful, and that men and women are fundamentally different and thus their different traditional roles in society should be maintained.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last = Lukas | first = Carrie | author-link = Carrie Lukas | contribution = Marriage: happier ever after | editor-last = Lukas | editor-first = Carrie | editor-link = Carrie Lukas | title = The politically incorrect guide to women, sex, and feminism | page = 75 | publisher = Regency Publishing | location = Washington, DC Lanham, Maryland | year = 2006 | isbn = 9781596980037 | quote = Feminists' assault on marriage also has played a role in devaluing marriage.

This goal must be achieved at any at all costs – to the woman herself, to the baby, to the family, and to society. Women must be made equal to men in their ability ''not'' to become pregnant and ''not'' to be expected to care for babies they may bring into the world. }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other anti-feminists oppose women's entry into the workforce, political office, and the voting process, as well as the lessening of male authority in families.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Gottfried |first=Paul | author-link = Paul Gottfried |title=The trouble with feminism  |url=https://www.lewrockwell.com/2001/04/paul-gottfried/the-trouble-with-feminism/ | work = [[LewRockwell.com]] (web magazine) |publisher= [[Lew Rockwell]] |date= 21 April 2001 |accessdate=30 September 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last = al-Qaradawi | first = Yusuf | author-link = Yusuf al-Qaradawi | contribution = Women and family in Islamist discourses: 'When Islam prohibits something, it closes all the avenues of approach to it'| editor-last = Calvert | editor-first = John | editor-link = John Calvert (scholar) | title = Islamism: a documentary and reference guide | page = 62 | publisher = Greenwood Press | location = Westport, Conn | year = 2008 | isbn = 9780313338564 | quote = Islamists are aggrieved at the support of ostensibly Muslim governments for the 'alleged' legal emancipation of women, including granting women the right to vote and hold public office, in addition to limited rights to initiate divorce.

The '''Five Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire''' (FFMQ) is a psychological measurement to explore [[Mindfulness (psychology)|mindfulness]]. It is based on five independently developed mindfulness questionnaires that are bound together in a factor analytic study. The questionnaire consists of 39 items. The five facets are: observing, describing, acting with awareness, non-judging of inner experience, and non-reactivity to inner experience.

==Criticism==
The FFMQ has been criticised, with specifics including that negative and positive wording constituted substantive method effects.&lt;ref&gt;http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/1073191112438743&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Forgiveness''' is the intentional and voluntary process by which a victim undergoes a change in feelings and attitude regarding an [[Crime|offense]], lets go of negative [[emotion]]s such as [[vengefulness]], forswears recompense from or punishment of the offender, however legally or morally justified it might be, and with an increased ability to wish the offender well.&lt;ref name="apa"&gt;{{cite web | year = 2006 | archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20110626153005/http://www.apa.org/international/resources/forgiveness.pdf | archive-date=2011-06-26 | url = http://www.apa.org/international/resources/forgiveness.pdf | title = American Psychological Association.

In certain contexts, forgiveness is a [[Law|legal]] term for absolving or giving up all claims on account of [[debt]], [[loan]], obligation, or other claims.&lt;ref&gt;[http://stats.oecd.org/glossary/detail.asp?ID=555 Debt Forgiveness] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131031215222/http://stats.oecd.org/glossary/detail.asp?ID=555 |date=2013-10-31 }} OECD, Glossary of Statistical Terms (2001)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://studentaid.ed.gov/repay-loans/forgiveness-cancellation/charts/public-service Loan Forgiveness] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131113023609/http://studentaid.ed.gov/repay-loans/forgiveness-cancellation/charts/public-service |date=2013-11-13 }} Glossary, U.S. Department of Education&lt;/ref&gt;

As a [[psychological]] concept and [[virtue]], the benefits of forgiveness have been explored in [[religion|religious]] thought, the [[social science]]s and [[medicine]]. Forgiveness may be considered simply in terms of the person who forgives&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Graham|first1=Michael C.|title=Facts of Life: ten issues of contentment|date=2014|publisher=Outskirts Press|page=268|ISBN=978-1-4787-2259-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; including forgiving themself, in terms of the person forgiven or in terms of the relationship between the forgiver and the person forgiven. In most contexts, forgiveness is granted without any expectation of [[restorative justice]], and without any response on the part of the offender (for example, one may forgive a person who is [[wikt:incommunicado|incommunicado]] or dead). In practical terms, it may be necessary for the offender to offer some form of acknowledgment, an [[wikt:apology|apology]], or even just ask for forgiveness, in order for the wronged person to believe themselves able to forgive as well.&lt;ref name="apa" /&gt;

Social and political dimensions of forgiveness involves the strictly private and religious sphere of "forgiveness". The notion of "forgiveness" is generally considered unusual in the political field. However, Hannah Arendt considers that the "faculty of forgiveness" has its place in public affairs. The philosopher believes that forgiveness can liberate resources both individually and collectively in the face of the irreparable. During an investigation in Rwanda on the discourses and practices of forgiveness after the 1994 genocide, sociologist Benoit Guillou illustrated the extreme [[polysemy]] of the word "forgiveness" but also the eminently political character of the notion. By way of conclusion of his work, the author proposes four main figures of forgiveness to better understanding, on the one hand, ambiguous uses and, on the other hand, the conditions under which forgiveness can mediate a resumption of social link.&lt;ref name="BenoitGuillou"&gt;{{cite web|year=2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161105223352/https://blogbenoitguillou.net/ |url=https://blogbenoitguillou.net/ |archive-date=2016-11-05 |title=''Benoît Guillou, Le pardon est-il durable ? Une enquête au Rwanda'', Paris, François Bourin |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most world religions include teachings on the nature of forgiveness, and many of these teachings provide an underlying basis for many varying modern day traditions and practices of forgiveness. Some religious [[doctrine]]s or [[philosophies]] place greater emphasis on the need for humans to find some sort of [[divine]] forgiveness for their own shortcomings, others place greater emphasis on the need for humans to practice forgiveness of one another, yet others make little or no distinction between human and divine forgiveness.

Although there is presently no consensus for a psychological definition of forgiveness in the research literature, agreement has emerged that forgiveness is a process and a number of models describing the process of forgiveness have been published, including one from a radical behavioral perspective.&lt;ref&gt;Cordova, J., Cautilli, J., Simon, C. &amp; Axelrod-Sabtig, R (2006). [http://www.behavior-analyst-online.org BAO "Behavior Analysis of Forgiveness in Couples Therapy"].

Dr. Robert Enright from the [[University of Wisconsin–Madison]] founded the International Forgiveness Institute and is considered the initiator of forgiveness studies. He developed a 20-Step Process Model of Forgiveness.&lt;ref&gt;Dr. Robert Enright, ''Forgiveness is a Choice'', American Psychological Association, 2001 {{ISBN|1-55798-757-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recent work has focused on what kind of person is more likely to be forgiving. A longitudinal study showed that people who were generally more [[neuroticism|neurotic]], [[Anger|angry]], and hostile in life were less likely to forgive another person even after a long time had passed. Specifically, these people were more likely to still avoid their transgressor and want to enact revenge upon them two and a half years after the transgression.&lt;ref&gt;Maltby, J., Wood, A. M., Day, L., Kon, T. W. H., Colley, A., and Linley, P. A. (2008). [http://personalpages.manchester.ac.uk/staff/alex.wood/forgiveness.pdf "Personality predictors of levels of forgiveness two and a half years after the transgression"]. {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090319205217/http://personalpages.manchester.ac.uk/staff/alex.wood/forgiveness.pdf |date=2009-03-19 }} ''Journal of Research in Personality'', 42, 1088–1094.&lt;/ref&gt;

Studies show that people who forgive are [[happiness|happier]] and [[health]]ier than those who hold resentments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | year = 2006 | url = http://www.forgiving.org | title = Forgiving (Campaign for Forgiveness Research) | accessdate = 2006-06-19 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060615102050/http://www.forgiving.org/ | archivedate = 2006-06-15 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; The first study to look at how forgiveness improves physical health discovered that when people think about forgiving an offender it leads to improved functioning in their [[Cardiovascular System|cardiovascular]] and [[nervous system]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Van Oyen, C. Witvilet, T.E. Ludwig and K. L. Vander Lann, "Granting Forgiveness or Harboring Grudges: Implications for Emotions, Physiology and Health," ''Psychological Science'' no. 12 (2001):117–23&lt;/ref&gt; Another study at the University of Wisconsin found the more forgiving people were, the less they suffered from a wide range of illnesses. The less forgiving people reported a greater number of health problems.&lt;ref&gt;S. Sarinopoulos, "Forgiveness and Physical Health: A Doctoral Dissertation Summary," ''World of Forgiveness'' no. 2 (2000): 16–18&lt;/ref&gt;

The research of Dr. Fred Luskin of [[Stanford University]], and author of the book "Learning to forgive"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://learningtoforgive.com/ |title=Learningtoforgive.com |publisher=Learningtoforgive.com |date=2014-06-20 |accessdate=2016-05-25 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160609022210/http://www.learningtoforgive.com/ |archivedate=2016-06-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; presented evidence that forgiveness can be learned based on research projects into the effects of forgiveness, giving empirical validity to the concept that forgiveness is not only powerful, but also excellent for your health was presented with a Champion of Forgiveness from the Worldwide Forgiveness Alliance on Forgiveness Day (first Sunday of August) for his teaching forgiveness as a life skill.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.forgivenessday.org/ |title=Worldwide Forgiveness Alliance |publisher=Forgivenessday.org |date=2015-11-13 |accessdate=2015-12-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050213063928/http://www.yogitimes.com/02_2005/interview.html |archivedate=2005-02-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In three separate studies, including one with [[Catholicism|Catholics]] and [[Protestantism|Protestants]] from [[Northern Ireland]] whose family members were murdered in [[The Troubles|the political violence]], he found that people who are taught how to forgive become less angry, feel less hurt, are more [[Optimism|optimistic]], become more forgiving in a variety of situations, and become more compassionate and self-confident. His studies show a reduction in experience of stress, physical manifestations of stress, and an increase in vitality.&lt;ref&gt;Fred Luskin, Ph.D. ''Forgive for Good: A Proven Prescription for Health and Happiness'' (Harper, 2002)&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=October 2018}}

&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Judaism]] --&gt;

In [[Judaism]], if a person causes harm, but then sincerely and honestly apologizes to the wronged individual and tries to rectify the wrong, the wronged individual is encouraged, but not required, to grant forgiveness:

* "It is forbidden to be obdurate and not allow yourself to be appeased. On the contrary, one should be easily pacified and find it difficult to become angry. When asked by an offender for forgiveness, one should forgive with a sincere mind and a willing spirit&amp;nbsp;... forgiveness is natural to the seed of Israel." ([[Mishneh Torah]], ''[[Teshuvah]]'' 2:10)

In Judaism, one must go ''to those he has harmed'' in order to be entitled to forgiveness.&lt;ref name="Yom Kippur"&gt;{{cite web | year = 2006 | url = http://www.jewfaq.org/holiday4.htm | title = ''JewFAQ discussion of forgiveness on Yom Kippur'' | accessdate = 2006-04-26 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160823211009/http://www.jfst.se/wp-content/uploads/Luach-2015-2016.pdf | archivedate = 2016-08-23 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; [One who sincerely apologizes three times for a wrong committed against another has fulfilled their obligation to seek forgiveness. ([[Shulchan Aruch]]) OC 606:1] This means that in Judaism a person cannot obtain forgiveness from [[God in Judaism|God]] for wrongs the person has done to other people. This also means that, unless the victim forgave the perpetrator before he died, [[Thou shalt not kill#Jewish doctrine|murder]] is unforgivable in Judaism, and they will answer to God for it, though the victims' family and friends can forgive the murderer for the [[grief]] they caused them. The ''[[Jewish prayer|Tefila]] Zaka'' [[Jewish meditation|meditation]], which is recited just before [[Yom Kippur]], closes with the following:

* "I know that there is no one so righteous that they have not wronged another, financially or physically, through deed or speech. This pains my heart within me, because wrongs between humans and their fellow are not atoned by Yom Kippur, until the wronged one is appeased. Because of this, my heart breaks within me, and my bones tremble; for even the day of death does not atone for such sins. Therefore I prostrate and beg before You, to have mercy on me, and grant me grace, compassion, and mercy in Your eyes and in the eyes of all people. For behold, I forgive with a final and resolved forgiveness anyone who has wronged me, whether in person or property, even if they slandered me, or spread falsehoods against me. So I release anyone who has injured me either in person or in property, or has committed any manner of sin that one may commit against another [except for legally enforceable business obligations, and except for someone who has deliberately harmed me with the thought ‘I can harm him because he will forgive me']. Except for these two, I fully and finally forgive everyone; may no one be punished because of me. And just as I forgive everyone, '''so may You grant me grace in the eyes of others, that they too forgive me absolutely'''." [emphasis added]

Thus the "reward" for forgiving others is not God's forgiveness for wrongs done to others, but rather help ''in obtaining forgiveness from the other person.''

Sir [[Jonathan Sacks]], [[Chief Rabbi]] of the [[List of Chief Rabbis of the United Hebrew Congregations|United Hebrew Congregations]] of the Commonwealth, summarized: "it is not that God forgives, while human beings do not. To the contrary, we believe that just as only God can forgive sins against God, so only human beings can forgive sins against human beings."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|year=2006 |url=http://www.chiefrabbi.org/thoughts/vayigash5766.pdf |title=''Covenant and Conversation'' |accessdate=2009-02-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090319205218/http://www.chiefrabbi.org/thoughts/vayigash5766.pdf |archivedate=2009-03-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jews observe a Day of Atonement Yom Kippur on the day before God makes decisions regarding what will happen during the coming year.&lt;ref name = "Yom Kippur" /&gt; [[Ten Days of Repentance|Just prior]] to Yom Kippur, [[Jews]] will ask forgiveness of those they have wronged during the prior year (if they have not already done so).&lt;ref name = "Yom Kippur" /&gt; During Yom Kippur itself, Jews [[Ta'anit|fast]] and pray for God's forgiveness for the [[Jewish views on sin|transgressions]] they have made against God in the prior year.&lt;ref name = "Yom Kippur" /&gt; Sincere [[Repentance in Judaism|repentance]] is required, and once again, God can only forgive one for the sins one has committed against God; this is why it is necessary for Jews also to seek the forgiveness of those people who they have wronged.&lt;ref name = "Yom Kippur" /&gt;

[[File:Rembrandt Harmensz van Rijn - Return of the Prodigal Son - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[Rembrandt]] – "The Return of the [[Prodigal Son]]]] 

Forgiveness is central to Christian ethics and is a frequent topic in sermons and theological works. Considering [[Mark 11]]:25, and [[Matthew 6:14–15]], that follows the [[Lord's Prayer]], "For if you forgive men when they sin against you, your heavenly Father will also forgive you. But if you do not forgive men their sins, your Father will not forgive your sins.," Forgiveness is not an option to a [[Christianity|Christian]], rather one must forgive to be a Christian.

In the [[New Testament]], [[Jesus in Christianity|Jesus]] speaks of the importance of [[Christian]]s forgiving or showing [[Mercy#Christianity|mercy]] towards others. Jesus used the [[Parable of the unforgiving servant|parable of the unmerciful servant]] ([[Matthew 18]]:21–35) to say that we should forgive without limits. [[Parable of the Prodigal Son]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | year = 2006 | url = http://www.comparativereligion.com/prodigal.html | title = The Parable of the Prodigal Son in Christianity and Buddhism | accessdate = 2009-02-03 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090201020909/http://comparativereligion.com/prodigal.html | archivedate = 2009-02-01 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; is perhaps the best known parable about forgiveness and refers to God's forgiveness for his people.

In the [[Sermon on the Mount]], Jesus repeatedly spoke of forgiveness, "Blessed are the merciful, for they will be shown mercy." [[Matthew 5:7]] ([[NIV]]) "Therefore, if you are offering your gift at the altar and there remember that your brother has something against you, leave your gift there in front of the altar. First go and be reconciled to your brother; then come and offer your gift." [[Matthew 5:23–24]] (NIV) "And when you stand praying, if you hold anything against anyone, forgive him, so that your Father in heaven may forgive you your sins." [[Mark 11]]:25 (NIV)* "But I tell you who hear me: Love your enemies, do good to those who hate you, bless those who curse you, pray for those who mistreat you. If someone strikes you on one cheek, turn to him the other also." [[Luke 6]]:27–29 (NIV) "Be merciful, just as your Father is merciful." Luke 6:36 (NIV) "Do not judge, and you will not be judged. Do not condemn, and you will not be condemned. Forgive, and you will be forgiven." Luke 6:37 (NIV)

Elsewhere, it is said, "Then Peter came to Him and said, "Lord, how often shall my brother sin against me, and I forgive him? Up to seven times?" Jesus said to him, "I do not say to you, up to seven times, but up to seventy times seven." Matthew 18:21–22 ([[New King James Version|NKJV]])

Jesus asked for God's forgiveness of those who [[Crucifixion of Jesus|crucified him]]. "And Jesus said, 'Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do.'" Luke 23: 34 (ESV)

[[Benedict XVI]], on a visit to [[Christianity in Lebanon|Lebanon]] in 2012, insisted that [[peace]] must be based on mutual forgiveness: "Only forgiveness, given and received, can lay lasting foundations for reconciliation and universal peace".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/benedict_xvi/speeches/2012/september/documents/hf_ben-xvi_spe_20120915_autorita_en.html |title=Apostolic Journey to Lebanon: Meeting with members of the government, institutions of the Republic, the diplomatic corps, religious leaders and representatives of the world of culture (May 25th Hall of the Baabda Presidential Palace, 15 September 2012) &amp;#124; BENEDICT XVI |publisher=Vatican.va |date= |accessdate=2015-12-23 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141024090318/http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/benedict_xvi/speeches/2012/september/documents/hf_ben-xvi_spe_20120915_autorita_en.html |archivedate=24 October 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Islam ====
{{Allah}}
[[Islam]] teaches that [[God in Islam|Allah]] is ''[[Al-Ghaffur]]'' "The Oft-Forgiving", and is the original source of all forgiveness (''ghufran'' {{lang|ar|[[Wiktionary:غفران|غفران]]}}). Seeking forgiveness from [[Allah]] with [[Repentance in Islam|repentance]] is a [[Virtue#Islam|virtue]].&lt;ref name="nnjre"&gt;Abu-Nimer &amp; Nasser (2013), "Forgiveness in The Arab and Islamic Contexts", ''Journal of Religious Ethics'', 41(3), pp. 474–494&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="olq" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{quran-usc|5|95}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote| (...) Allah forgives what is past: for repetition Allah will exact from him the penalty. For Allah is Exalted, and Lord of Retribution.|[[Al-Ma'ida|Quran 5]]:95||}}

Islam [[Mustahabb|recommends]] forgiveness, because Allah values forgiveness. There are numerous verses in [[Quran]] and the [[Hadith]]s recommending forgiveness. However, Islam also allows [[Qisas|revenge]] to the extent harm done, but forgiveness is encouraged, with a promise of [[Thawab|reward]] from Allah.&lt;ref&gt;Mohammad Hassan Khalil (2012), ''Islam and the Fate of Others: The Salvation Question'', Oxford University Press, pp. 65–94, {{ISBN|978-0199796663}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{quran-usc|42|40}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|The recompense for an injury is an injury equal thereto (in degree): but if a person forgives and makes reconciliation, his reward is due from Allah: for (Allah) loveth not those who do wrong.|[[Ash-Shura|Quran 42]]:40||}}

''Afw'' ([[Wiktionary:عفو|عفو]] is another term for forgiveness in Islam; it occurs 35 times in Quran, and in some [[Schools of Islamic theology|Islamic theological studies]], it is used interchangeably with ''ghufran''.&lt;ref name="nnjre" /&gt;&lt;ref name="olq"&gt;Oliver Leaman (2005), The Qur'an: An Encyclopedia, Routledge, {{ISBN|978-0415326391}}, pp. 213-216&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Shah, S. S. (1996), "Mercy Killing in Islam: Moral and Legal Issues", ''Arab Law Quarterly'', 11(2), pp. 105–115.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Afw'' means to pardon, to excuse for a fault or an offense. According to Muhammad Amanullah,&lt;ref name="maislam"&gt;Amanullah, M. (2004), "Just Retribution (Qisas) Versus Forgiveness (‘Afw)", in ''Islam: Past, Present AND Future'', pp. 871–883; International Seminar on Islamic Thoughts Proceedings, December 2004, Department of Theology and Philosophy, Faculty of Islamic Studies Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia&lt;/ref&gt; forgiveness ('Afw) in Islam is derived from three wisdoms. First and the most important wisdom of forgiveness is that it is [[Mercy#Islam|merciful]] when the victim or [[Wali|guardian]] of the victim accepts money instead of revenge.&lt;ref&gt;Gottesman, E. (1991), "Reemergence of Qisas and Diyat in Pakistan, ''Columbia Human Rights Law Review'', 23, pp. 433–439&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tsang, J. A., McCullough, M. E., &amp; Hoyt, W. T. (2005). "Psychometric and Rationalization Accounts of the Religion-Forgiveness Discrepancy", ''Journal of Social Issues'', 61(4), pp. 785–805.&lt;/ref&gt; The second wisdom of forgiveness is that it increases honor and prestige of the one who forgives.&lt;ref name="maislam" /&gt; Forgiveness is not a sign of weakness, humiliation or dishonor.&lt;ref name="olq" /&gt; Forgiveness is honor, raises the merit of the forgiver in the eyes of Allah, and enables a forgiver to enter [[Jannah|paradise]].&lt;ref name="maislam" /&gt; The third wisdom of forgiveness is that according to some scholars, such as al-Tabari and al-Qurtubi, forgiveness expiates (''[[Fidyah and Kaffara|kaffarah]]'') the forgiver from the sins they may have committed at other occasions in life.&lt;ref name="olq" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Khalil Athamina (1992), "Al-Qisas: its emergence, religious origin and its socio-political impact on early Muslim society", ''Studia Islamica'', pp. 53–74&lt;/ref&gt; Forgiveness is a form of charity (''[[Sadaqah|sadaqat]]''). Forgiveness comes from [[taqwa]] (piety), a quality of [[Fear of God|God-fearing]] people.&lt;ref name="maislam" /&gt;

==== Bahá'í Faith ====
In the [[Bahá'í literature|Bahá'í Writings]], this explanation is given of how to be forgiving towards others:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"Love the creatures for the sake of God and not for themselves. You will never become angry or impatient if you love them for the sake of God. Humanity is not perfect. There are imperfections in every human being, and you will always become unhappy if you look toward the people themselves. But if you look toward God, you will love them and be kind to them, for the world of God is the world of perfection and complete mercy. Therefore, do not look at the shortcomings of anybody; see with the sight of forgiveness."
&lt;br&gt; — [[`Abdu'l-Bahá]], ''The Promulgation of Universal Peace'', p. 92
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==== Buddhism ====
In [[Buddhism]], forgiveness is seen as a practice to prevent harmful thoughts from causing havoc on one's mental well-being.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | year = 2006 | url = http://www.psychjourney.com/Buddhism%20Series.htm | title = Psychjourney – Introduction to Buddhism Series | accessdate = 2006-06-19 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060414062806/http://www.psychjourney.com/Buddhism%20Series.htm | archivedate = 2006-04-14 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Buddhism recognizes that [[Vedanā|feelings]] of [[Dvesha (Buddhism)|hatred]] and [[Vyāpāda|ill-will]] leave a lasting effect on our mind [[Karma in Buddhism|karma]]. Instead, Buddhism encourages the cultivation of thoughts that leave a wholesome effect. "In contemplating the law of karma, we realize that it is not a matter of seeking revenge but of practicing [[mettā]] and forgiveness, for the victimizer is, truly, the most unfortunate of all."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | year = 2006 | url = http://www.abhayagiri.org/index.php/main/article/universal_loving_kindness/#top | title = Abhayagiri Buddhist Monastery - Universal Loving Kindness | accessdate = 2009-02-07 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20081210082606/http://www.abhayagiri.org/index.php/main/article/universal_loving_kindness/#top | archivedate = 2008-12-10 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; When resentments have already arisen, the Buddhist view is to calmly proceed to release them by going back to their roots. Buddhism centers on release from delusion and suffering through [[Buddhist meditation|meditation]] and receiving insight into the nature of [[Reality in Buddhism|reality]].
Buddhism questions the reality of the [[Raga (Buddhism)|passions]] that make forgiveness necessary as well as the reality of the objects of those passions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | year = 2006 | url = http://josephsoleary.typepad.com/my_weblog/buddhism/index.html | title = Spirit of Vatican II: Buddhism – Buddhism and Forgiveness | accessdate = 2009-02-07 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20081208080949/http://josephsoleary.typepad.com/my_weblog/buddhism/index.html | archivedate = 2008-12-08 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; "If we haven’t forgiven, we keep creating an identity around our pain, and that is what is reborn. That is what suffers."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | year = 2006 | url = http://www.abhayagiri.org/index.php/main/article/preparing_for_death/#top | title = Abhayagiri Buddhist Monastery - Preparing for Death | accessdate = 2006-06-19 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060118231818/http://www.abhayagiri.org/index.php/main/article/preparing_for_death/#top | archivedate = 2006-01-18 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Buddhism places much emphasis on the concepts of ''Mettā'' (loving kindness), ''[[Karuṇā|karuna]]'' (compassion), ''[[mudita]]'' (sympathetic joy), and ''[[upekkhā]]'' (equanimity), as a means to avoiding resentments in the first place. These reflections are used to understand the context of suffering in the world, both our own and the suffering of others.

The word ''ksama'' is often combined with ''kripa'' (tenderness), ''daya'' (kindness) and ''karuna'' ([[Wiktionary:करुणा|करुणा]], compassion) in [[Sanskrit literature|Sanskrit texts]].&lt;ref name="mpt"&gt;Michael E. McCullough, Kenneth I. Pargament, Carl E. Thoresen (2001), ''Forgiveness: Theory, Research, and Practice'', The Guildford Press, {{ISBN|978-1572307117}}, pp. 21–39&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Rg Veda]], forgiveness is discussed in verses dedicated to deity Varuna, both the context of the one who has done wrong and one who is wronged.&lt;ref&gt;Ralph Griffith (Transl.), ''The Hymns of Rg Veda'', Motilal Banarsidas (1973)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hunter, Alan (2007), "Forgiveness: Hindu and Western Perspectives", ''[[Journal of Hindu-Christian Studies]]'', 20(1), 11&lt;/ref&gt; Forgiveness is considered one of the six cardinal [[Virtue#Hinduism|virtues]] in Hindu Dharma.

The [[Theology|theological]] basis for forgiveness in Hindu Dharma is that a person who does not forgive carries a baggage of memories of the wrong, of negative feelings, of [[Anger#Hinduism|anger]] and unresolved emotions that affect their present as well as future. In Hindu Dharma, not only should one forgive others, but one must also seek forgiveness if one has wronged someone else.&lt;ref name="mpt" /&gt; Forgiveness is to be sought from the individual wronged, as well as society at large, by acts of [[Dāna#Hinduism|charity]], [[Ritual purification#Hinduism|purification]], [[Vrata#Hinduism|fasting]], [[Hinduism#Rituals|rituals]] and [[Dhyana in Hinduism|meditative]] introspection.

The concept of forgiveness is further refined in Hindu Dharma by rhetorically contrasting it in feminine and masculine form. In feminine form, one form of forgiveness is explained through [[Lakshmi]] (called [[Hindu deities|Goddess]] Sri in some parts of India); the other form is explained in the masculine form through her husband [[Vishnu]].&lt;ref name="mpt" /&gt; Feminine Lakshmi forgives even when the one who does wrong does not repent. Masculine Vishnu, on the other hand, forgives only when the wrongdoer repents. In Hindu Dharma, the feminine forgiveness granted without repentance by Lakshmi is higher and more noble than the masculine forgiveness granted only after there is repentance. In the Hindu epic [[Ramayana]], [[Sita]] – the wife of King [[Rama]] – is symbolically eulogized for forgiving a crow even as it harms her. Later in the epic Ramayana, she is eulogized again for forgiving those who harass her while she has been kidnapped in [[Lanka]].&lt;ref name="mpt" /&gt; Many other Hindu stories discuss forgiveness with or without repentance.&lt;ref&gt;Ransley, Cynthia (2004), ''Forgiveness: Themes and issues. Forgiveness and the healing process: A central therapeutic concern'', {{ISBN|1-58391-182-0}}, Brunner-Routledge, pp. 10–32&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of forgiveness is treated in extensive debates of Hindu literature. In some [[Hindu texts]],&lt;ref&gt;See Manusamhita, 11.55, Mahabharata Vol II, 1022:8&lt;/ref&gt; certain [[Sin#Hinduism|sins]] and intentional acts are debated as naturally unforgivable; for example, murder and rape; these ancient scholars argue whether blanket forgiveness is [[Hindu ethics|morally]] justifiable in every circumstance, and whether forgiveness encourages crime, disrespect, social disorder and people not taking you seriously.&lt;ref&gt;Prafulla Mohapatra (2008), ''Ethics and Society'', Concept Publishing, {{ISBN|978-8180695230}}, pp. 22–25&lt;/ref&gt; Other ancient Hindu texts highlight that forgiveness is not same as reconciliation.

Forgiveness in Hindu Dharma does not necessarily require that one reconcile with the offender, nor does it rule out reconciliation in some situations. Instead forgiveness in Hindu philosophy is being [[Compassion#Hinduism|compassionate]], tender, kind and letting go of the harm or hurt caused by someone or something else.&lt;ref&gt;Temoshok and Chandra, ''Forgiveness: Theory, Research, and Practice'', The Guildford Press, {{ISBN|978-1572307117}}, see Chapter 3&lt;/ref&gt; Forgiveness is essential for one to free oneself from negative thoughts, and being able to focus on blissfully living a moral and ethical life (''dharmic'' life).&lt;ref name="mpt" /&gt; In the highest self-realized state, forgiveness becomes the essence of one's personality, where the persecuted person remains unaffected, without agitation, without feeling like a victim, free from [[Arishadvargas|anger]] (''akrodhi'').&lt;ref&gt;Radhakrishnan (1995), ''Religion and Society'', Indus, Harper Collins India&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sinha (1985), ''Indian psychology'', Vol 2, ''Emotion and Will'', Motilal Banarsidas, New Delhi&lt;/ref&gt;

Other epics and ancient literature of Hindu Dharma discuss forgiveness. For example:

{{quote|&lt;poem&gt;Forgiveness is virtue; forgiveness is sacrifice; forgiveness is the Vedas; forgiveness is the Shruti.

In [[Jainism]], forgiveness is one of the main virtues that needs to be cultivated by the Jains. ''Kṣamāpanā'' or supreme forgiveness forms part of one of the ten characteristics of ''[[Dharma (Jainism)|dharma]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Varni, Jinendra; Ed. Prof. Sagarmal Jain, ''Translated Justice'' T.K. Tukol and Dr. K.K. Dixit (1993). Samaṇ Suttaṁ. New Delhi: Bhagwan Mahavir memorial Samiti. verse 84&lt;/ref&gt; In the Jain prayer, (''[[pratikramana]]'') Jains repeatedly seek forgiveness from various creatures—even from ''ekindriyas'' or single sensed [[Jain terms and concepts#Classes of beings|beings]] like plants and microorganisms that they may have harmed while eating and doing routine activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last =Jaini | first =Padmanabh | title =Collected Papers on Jaina Studies | publisher =Motilal Banarsidass Publ. | year =2000 | location =Delhi | isbn =81-208-1691-9 }} p. 285&lt;/ref&gt; Forgiveness is asked by uttering the phrase, ''Micchāmi dukkaḍaṃ.'' ''Micchāmi dukkaḍaṃ'' is a [[Prakrit language]] phrase literally meaning "may all the evil that has been done be fruitless."&lt;ref&gt;Chapple. C.K. (2006) ''Jainism and Ecology: Nonviolence in the Web of Life'' Delhi:Motilal Banarasidas Publ. {{ISBN|978-81-208-2045-6}} p.46&lt;/ref&gt; During ''[[samvatsari]]''—the last day of Jain festival ''[[paryusana]]''—Jains utter the phrase ''Micchami Dukkadam'' after ''[[pratikraman]]''. As a matter of [[Jain rituals|ritual]], they personally greet their friends and relatives ''micchāmi dukkaḍaṃ'' seeking their forgiveness. No private quarrel or dispute may be carried beyond samvatsari, and letters and telephone calls are made to the outstation friends and relatives asking their forgiveness.&lt;ref&gt;Hastings, James (2003), ''Encyclopedia of Religion and Ethics'' Part 10, Kessinger Publishing {{ISBN|978-0-7661-3682-3}} p.876&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Pratikraman]]'' also contains the following prayer:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last =Jaini | first =Padmanabh | title =Collected Papers on Jaina Studies | publisher =Motilal Banarsidass Publ. | year =2000 | location =Delhi | isbn =81-208-1691-9 }} p.18 and 224&lt;/ref&gt;

''Khāmemi savva-jīve savvë jive khamantu me / ''

''metti me savva-bhūesu, veraṃ mejjha na keṇavi //''

(I ask pardon of all creatures, may all creatures pardon me.

May I have friendship with all beings and enmity with none.)
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In their daily prayers and [[samayika]], Jains recite ''Iryavahi sutra'' seeking forgiveness from all creatures while involved in routine activities:&lt;ref&gt;Translated from Prakrit by Nagin J. shah and Madhu Sen (1993) ''Concept of Pratikramana'' Ahmedabad: Gujarat Vidyapith pp.25–26&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
May you, O Revered One! Voluntarily permit me. I would like to confess my sinful acts committed while walking. I honour your permission. I desire to absolve myself of the sinful acts by confessing them. I seek forgiveness from all those living beings which I may have tortured while walking, coming and going, treading on living organism, seeds, green grass, dew drops, ant hills, moss, live water, live earth, spider web and others. I seek forgiveness from all these living beings, be they — one sensed, two sensed, three sensed, four sensed or five sensed. Which I may have kicked, covered with dust, rubbed with ground, collided with other, turned upside down, tormented, frightened, shifted from one place to another or killed and deprived them of their lives. (By confessing) may I be absolved of all these sins.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Jain texts quote [[Mahavira|Māhavīra]] on forgiveness:&lt;ref&gt;*{{cite book | last =Jacobi | first =Hermann | authorlink =Hermann Jacobi | editor =(ed.) [[Max Müller|F.

By practicing ''prāyaṣcitta'' (repentance), a soul gets rid of sins, and commits no transgressions; he who correctly practises ''prāyaṣcitta'' gains the road and the reward of the road, he wins the reward of good conduct. By begging forgiveness he obtains happiness of mind; thereby he acquires a kind disposition towards all kinds of living beings; by this kind disposition he obtains purity of character and freedom from fear.

— Māhavīra in ''Uttarādhyayana Sūtra'' 29:17–18

Even the code of conduct amongst the [[Jain monasticism|monks]] requires the monks to ask forgiveness for all transgressions:&lt;ref&gt;*{{cite book | last =Jacobi | first =Hermann | authorlink =Hermann Jacobi | editor =(ed.)

&lt;blockquote&gt;
If among monks or nuns occurs a quarrel or dispute or dissension, the young monk should ask forgiveness of the superior, and the superior of the young monk. They should forgive and ask forgiveness, appease and be appeased, and converse without restraint. For him who is appeased, there will be success (in control); for him who is not appeased, there will be no success; therefore one should appease one's self. 'Why has this been said, Sir? Peace is the essence of monasticism'.

==== Hoʻoponopono ====
[[Hoʻoponopono]] is an ancient Hawaiian practice of reconciliation and forgiveness, combined with prayer. Similar forgiveness practices were performed on islands throughout the [[Oceania|South Pacific]], including [[Samoa]], [[Tahiti]] and [[New Zealand]]. Traditionally Hoʻoponopono is practiced by healing priests or ''[[kahuna]] lapaʻau'' among family members of a person who is physically ill. Modern versions are performed within the family by a family elder, or by the individual alone.

== Popular recognition ==
The need to forgive is widely recognized by the public, but they are often at a loss for ways to accomplish it. For example, in a large representative sampling of American people on various religious topics in 1988, [[the Gallup Organization]] found that 94% said it was important to forgive, but 85% said they needed some outside help to be able to forgive. However, not even regular prayer was found to be effective.

Akin to forgiveness is [[mercy]], so even if a person is not able to complete the forgiveness process they can still show mercy, especially when so many wrongs are done out of weakness rather than malice. The [[Gallup poll]] revealed that the only thing that was effective was "[[meditation|meditative prayer]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Gorsuch | first1 = R. L. | last2 = Hao | first2 = J.

Forgiveness as a tool has been extensively used in [[restorative justice]] programs, after the abolition of [[apartheid]] [[Truth and Reconciliation Commission (South Africa)]], run for victims and perpetrators of [[Rwandan genocide]], the violence in [[Israeli–Palestinian conflict]], and [[Northern Ireland conflict]], which has also been documented in film, ''[[Beyond Right and Wrong: Stories of Justice and Forgiveness]]'' (2012).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=The key to forgiveness is the refusal to seek revenge |url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/belief/2013/feb/08/key-forgiveness-refusal-seek-revenge |publisher=The Guardian |date=8 February 2013 |accessdate=Feb 21, 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140324002701/http://www.theguardian.com/uk/belief/2013/feb/08/key-forgiveness-refusal-seek-revenge |archivedate=24 March 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Beyond Right &amp; Wrong: Stories of Justice and Forgiveness|url=http://theforgivenessproject.com/beyond-right-wrong-stories-of-justice-and-forgiveness/|date=February 1, 2013|publisher=Forgiveness Project|accessdate=February 22, 2013|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130302112321/http://theforgivenessproject.com/beyond-right-wrong-stories-of-justice-and-forgiveness/|archivedate=March 2, 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Forgiveness In Relationships ==
'''Forgiveness''' in [[marriage]] is an important aspect in a marriage. When two individuals are able to forgive each other it results in a long [[Happiness|happy]] marriage. Forgiveness can help prevent problems from accruing in the married couple's future.&lt;ref name="Fincham Hall Beach 2006"&gt;Fincham, F., Hall, J., &amp; Beach, S. (2006). Forgiveness In Marriage: Current Status And Future Directions. Family Relations, 415–427.&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2005 study, researchers were interested in figuring out whether forgiveness is important in a marriage. When does forgiveness usually accrue? Does it accrue before an argument or after an argument? Does forgiveness take a role when a person breaks a promise? etc&lt;ref name="Fincham Hall Beach 2006" /&gt; Researcher found six components that were related to forgiveness in marriage and explains how each one relates to forgiveness. The six components are: [[Contentment|Satisfaction]], [[Ambivalence]], [[Conflict (process)|Conflict]], Attributions, [[Empathy]] and [[wikt:commitment|Commitment]].&lt;ref name="Fincham Hall Beach 2006" /&gt;

Researchers provided an overview of forgiveness in marriage and how individuals in a  [[Intimate relationship|relationship]] believe that if forgiveness accrues then you must [[Forgetting|forget]] what had happened.&lt;ref name="Fincham Hall Beach 2006" /&gt;  Moreover, based on the interventions and recommendations the researcher started to see how important forgiveness is in a relationship and how it can lead to a happy and healthy relationship.&lt;ref name="Fincham Hall Beach 2006" /&gt;

In a 2005 study, researchers mentioned that when couples forgive their spouses they sometimes need help from professionals to overcome their pain that might be left behind.&lt;ref name="Fincham Hall Beach 2006" /&gt; Researchers also described the difference between how each individual perceives the situation based on who is in pain and who caused the pain. Also how the couple react to the situation based on their feelings and how they personally respond to the situation.&lt;ref name="Fincham Hall Beach 2006" /&gt;

'''The model of forgiveness:'''

"Enright's model of forgiveness has received empirical support and sees forgiveness as a journey through four phases" which are:&lt;ref name="Fincham Hall Beach 2006" /&gt;

# '''Uncovering phase''':  Emphases on exploring the pain that the individual has experienced.
# '''Decision phase''': The nature of forgiveness is discussed. Also the individual commits that they will try to forgive the spouse
# '''Work phase''': shifts the focus to the transgressor in an effort to gain insight and understanding.
# '''Deepening phase''': the victim moves toward resolution, becoming aware that they are not alone, has themself been the recipient of others' forgiveness, and finds meaning and purpose in the forgiveness process.&lt;ref name="Fincham Hall Beach 2006" /&gt;

Furthermore, when married couples argue they tend to focus on who is right and who is wrong. Also couples tend to focus on who proves the other wrong which can cause more problems and can make the problem worse because it will make it harder to forgive one another.&lt;ref name="Fincham Hall Beach 2006" /&gt;

'''Recommendation and [[interventions]]:'''

The researchers also came up with recommendation for practitioners and intervention to help individuals that are married on how to communicate with each other, how to resolve problems and how to make it easier to forgive each other.&lt;ref name="Fincham Hall Beach 2006" /&gt;
Some of the interventions of forgiveness in marriage has been a great success. It encouraged forgiveness and made couples happier together.&lt;ref name="Fincham Hall Beach 2006" /&gt;
 
Some of the recommendations that was given to practitioners was that the individuals had to explore and understand what forgiveness means before starting any intervention because the preconceived idea of forgiveness can cause problems with couples being open to forgive.&lt;ref name="Fincham Hall Beach 2006" /&gt; For example, an individual not forgiving their spouse out of fear that the spouse might think that they are weak which can cause a conflict.&lt;ref name="Fincham Hall Beach 2006" /&gt; It was stated that the couple must know the following:
* Forgiveness takes
* The different forms of forgiveness
* The danger in communicating in forgiveness
* That Perpetrators and victims have different perceptive context is important&lt;ref name="Fincham Hall Beach 2006" /&gt;

Furthermore, the researchers thought of ways to further help married couples in the future and suggested that they should explore the following:
* The importance of seeking forgiveness
* [[Self-forgiveness]]
* The role of the sacred in marital forgiveness&lt;ref name="Fincham Hall Beach 2006" /&gt;

''[[Interpersonal relationship|Relationships]]'' are at the sentiment aspect of our lives; with our families at home and friends outside. Relationships interact in schools and universities, with work mates and, with colleagues at the workplace and in our diverse communities. In the article it states, the quality of these relationships determines our individual well-being, how well we learn, develop and function, our sense of connectedness with others and the health so society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fincham.info/papers/2006-fr.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-08-15 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151123031300/http://www.fincham.info/papers/2006-fr.pdf |archivedate=2015-11-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002, two innovators of ''[[Positive Psychology]]'', Ed Diener and Martin Seligman, conducted a study at the University of Illinois on the 10% of students with the highest scores recorded on a survey of personal happiness. What they came up with was most salient characteristics shared by students who were very content and showed positive life styles were the ones who "their strong ties to friends and family and commitment to spending time with them."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Ed Diener1 |author2=Martin E.P. Seligman |url=http://pss.sagepub.com/content/13/1/81.abstract |title=Very Happy People |publisher=Pss.sagepub.com |date=2002-01-01 |accessdate=2015-12-23 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151214220848/http://pss.sagepub.com/content/13/1/81.abstract |archivedate=2015-12-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A study done in 2000,  identified as a key study that taken part and examined two natures of relationships (friends and family) and at what age does the support switch importance from one to the other.  What the study showed that people whom had good family relationship, they were able to carry out more positive outside relationships with friends. Through the ''[[family]]''  relationship and friendships  the character of the individual was built to forgive and learn from the experience in the family. It just goes to show that to have a good base at the start of a young age, will train the person to have good better well-being with outside interactions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Yi Xie |author2=Siqing Peng |title=How to repair customer trust after negative publicity: The roles of competence, integrity, benevolence, and forgiveness |date=July 2009 |journal=Psychology &amp; Marketing |volume=26 |issue=7 |pages=572–589 |doi=10.1002/mar.20289 |url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/mar.20289/abstract |accessdate=2015-12-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2001,  Charlotte vanOyen Witvliet  asked people to think about someone who had hurt, wronged, or offended them. As they thought to answer, she observed their reaction. She observed their blood pressure, heart rate, facial muscle tension, and sweat gland activity. To deliberate on an old misdemeanor is to practice unforgiveness. The outcome to the recall of the grudge the candidates’ blood pressure and heart rate increased, and they sweated more. Pondering about their resents was stressful, and subjects found the rumination unpleasant. When they adept forgiveness, their physical stimulation glided downward. They showed no more of an anxiety reaction than normal wakefulness produces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://pss.sagepub.com/content/12/2/117.short |title=Granting Forgiveness or Harboring Grudges: Implications for Emotion, Physiology, and Health |publisher=Pss.sagepub.com |date=2001-03-01 |accessdate=2015-12-23 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151208132229/http://pss.sagepub.com/content/12/2/117.short |archivedate=2015-12-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, study on self-forgiveness with spouse forgiveness has a better outcome to a healthier life by Pelucchi, Paleari, Regalia and Fincham. This study investigates  ''[[self-forgiveness]]''  for real hurts committed against the partner in a romantic relationship (168 couples). For both males and females, the mistaken partners were more content with their romantic relationship to the extent that they had more positive and less negative sentiment and thoughts toward themselves. In the study when looking at the victimized partners were more gratified with the relationship when the offending partner had less negative sentiment and thoughts towards themselves. It concludes that self-forgiveness when in a relationship has positive impact on both the offending and victimized partner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://psycnet.apa.org/journals/fam/27/6/861/|title=PsycNET|author=|date=|website=psycnet.apa.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Forgiveness Interventions ==
Both negative and positive affect play a role in forgiveness interventions. It is the general consensus across researchers in the field of [[psychology]], that the overarching purpose of forgiveness interventions is to decrease overall negative affect associated with the stimulus and increase the individual's positive affect.&lt;ref name="Understanding concerns"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Understanding concerns about interventions to promote forgiveness: A review of the literature.|url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1037/0033-3204.45.1.88|journal = Psychotherapy: Theory, Research, Practice, Training|date = 2008-01-01|volume = 45|issue = 1|doi = 10.1037/0033-3204.45.1.88|first = Nathaniel G.|last = Wade|first2 = Chad V.|last2 = Johnson|first3 = Julia E.|last3 = Meyer|pages=88–102}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Wade Bailey Schaffer 2005"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wade|first1=Nathaniel G.|last2=Bailey|first2=Donna C.|last3=Shaffer|first3=Philip|title=Helping Clients Heal: Does Forgiveness Make a Difference?|journal=Professional Psychology: Research and Practice|date=2005|volume=36|issue=6|pages=634–641|doi=10.1037/0735-7028.36.6.634}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The disease model has been mainly used in regards to [[therapy]], however the incorporation of forgiveness into therapy has been lacking,&lt;ref name="Understanding concerns" /&gt; and has been slowly gaining popularity in the last couple of decades.&lt;ref name="Understanding concerns" /&gt; More recent research has shown how the growth of forgiveness in psychology has given rise to the study of forgiveness interventions.&lt;ref name="Understanding concerns" /&gt;

=== Different Types ===
There are various forms of forgiveness interventions.&lt;ref name="Understanding concerns" /&gt; One common adaptation used by researchers is where patients are forced to confront the entity preventing them from forgiving by using [[introspection|introspective]] techniques and expressing this to the therapist. &lt;ref name="Understanding concerns" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Wade Bailey Schaffer 2005" /&gt; Another popular forgiveness intervention is getting individual to try and see things from the offender's point of view. The end goal for this adaptation is getting the individual to perhaps understand the reasoning behind the offender's actions.&lt;ref name="Understanding concerns" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Wade Bailey Schaffer 2005" /&gt; If they are able to do this then they might be able to forgive the offender more easily.&lt;ref name="Understanding concerns" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Wade Bailey Schaffer 2005" /&gt;

There is, however, conflicting evidence on the effectiveness of forgiveness interventions.&lt;ref name="Understanding concerns" /&gt;

=== Contrary Evidence ===
Although research has taken into account the positive aspects of forgiveness interventions, there are also negative aspects that have been explored as well. Some researchers have taken a critical approach and have been less accepting of the forgiveness intervention approach to therapy.&lt;ref name="Understanding concerns" /&gt;

Critics have argued that forgiveness interventions may actually cause an increase in negative affect because it is trying to inhibit the individual's own personal feelings towards the offender. This can result in the individual feeling negatively towards themself.&lt;ref name="Understanding concerns" /&gt; This approach is categorizing the individual's feelings by implying that the negative emotions the individual is feeling are unacceptable and feelings of forgiveness is the correct and acceptable way to feel. It might inadvertently promote feelings of [[shame]] and [[contrition]] within the individual.&lt;ref name="Understanding concerns" /&gt;

Some researchers also worry that forgiveness interventions will promote unhealthy relationships.&lt;ref name="Understanding concerns" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Stover 2005"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Stover|first1=C. S.|title=Domestic Violence Research: What Have We Learned and Where Do We Go From Here?|journal=Journal of Interpersonal Violence|date=1 April 2005|volume=20|issue=4|pages=448–454|doi=10.1177/0886260504267755}}&lt;/ref&gt; They worry that individuals with toxic relationships will continue to forgive those who continuously commit wrong acts towards them when in fact they should be distancing themselves from these sorts of people.&lt;ref name="Understanding concerns" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Stover 2005" /&gt;

A number of studies showcase high effectiveness rates of forgiveness interventions when done continuously over a long period of time.&lt;ref name="Understanding concerns" /&gt; Some researchers have found that these interventions have been proven ineffective when done over short spans of time.&lt;ref name="Understanding concerns" /&gt;

=== Forgiveness Interventions: Children ===
There has been some research within the last decade outlining some studies that have looked at the effectiveness of forgiveness interventions on young children. There have also been several studies done studying this cross culturally.&lt;ref name="Understanding concerns" /&gt; One study that explored this relationship, was a study conducted in 2009 by Eadaoin Hui and Tat Sing Chau. In this study, Hui and Chau looked at the relationship between forgiveness interventions and Chinese children who were less likely to forgive those who had wronged them.&lt;ref name="Understanding concerns" /&gt; The findings of this study showed that there was an effect of forgiveness interventions on the young Chinese children.&lt;ref name="Understanding concerns" /&gt;

== Forgiveness and Health ==
Survey data from 2000 showed that 61% of participants that were part of a small religious group reported that the group helped them be more forgiving.&lt;ref name="How Religious Groups Promote Forgiving"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = How Religious Groups Promote Forgiving: A National Study|url = http://doi.wiley.com/10.1111/0021-8294.00011|journal = Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion|date = 2000-01-01|volume = 39|issue = 2|doi = 10.1111/0021-8294.00011|first = Robert|last = Wuthnow|pages=125–139}}&lt;/ref&gt; Individuals reported that their religion groups which promote forgiveness was related to self-reports of success in overcoming [[addictions]], [[guilt (emotion)|guilt]], and perceiving encouragement when feeling discouraged.&lt;ref name="How Religious Groups Promote Forgiving" /&gt;

It is suggested that [[mindfulness]] plays a role in forgiveness and health.&lt;ref name="Forgiveness, Mindfulness, and Health"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Forgiveness, Mindfulness, and Health|url = https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12671-012-0119-0|journal = Mindfulness|date = 2012-06-22|issn = 1868–8527|pages = 235–245|volume = 4|issue = 3|doi = 10.1007/s12671-012-0119-0|first = Jon R.|last = Webb|first2 = T. Dustin|last2 = Phillips|first3 = David|last3 = Bumgarner|first4 = Elizabeth|last4 = Conway-Williams}}&lt;/ref&gt; The forgiveness of others has a positive effect on physical health when it is combined with mindfulness but evidence shows that forgiveness only effects health as a function of mindfulness.&lt;ref name="Forgiveness, Mindfulness, and Health" /&gt;

A study from 2005 states that self-forgiveness is an important part of self-acceptance and [[mental health]] in later life.&lt;ref name="Self-Forgiveness A Component"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Self-Forgiveness A Component of Mental Health in Later Life|url = http://roa.sagepub.com/content/27/3/267|journal = Research on Aging|date = 2005-05-01|issn = 0164-0275|pages = 267–289|volume = 27|issue = 3|doi = 10.1177/0164027504274122|first = Berit|last = Ingersoll-Dayton|first2 = Neal|last2 = Krause|deadurl = no|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20130728082538/http://roa.sagepub.com/content/27/3/267|archivedate = 2013-07-28|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The inability to self-forgive can compromise mental health.&lt;ref name="Self-Forgiveness A Component" /&gt; For some elderly people, self-forgiveness requires reflecting on a transgression to avoid repeating wrongdoings, individuals seek to learn from these transgressions in order to improve their real self-schemas.&lt;ref name="Self-Forgiveness A Component" /&gt; When individuals are successful at learning from these transgressions, they may experience improved mental health.&lt;ref name="Self-Forgiveness A Component" /&gt;

A study in 2015 looks at how self-forgiveness can reduce feelings of guilt and shame associated with [[hypersexual]] behaviour.&lt;ref name="Self-Forgiveness and Hypersexual Behavior"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Self-Forgiveness and Hypersexual Behavior|url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10720162.2014.1001542|journal = Sexual Addiction &amp; Compulsivity|date = 2015-01-02|issn = 1072-0162|pages = 59–70|volume = 22|issue = 1|doi = 10.1080/10720162.2014.1001542|first = Joshua N.|last = Hook|first2 = Jennifer E.|last2 = Farrell|first3 = Don E.|last3 = Davis|first4 = Daryl R.

Evidence shows that self-forgiveness and [[procrastination]] may be associated; self-forgiveness allows the individual to overcome the negatives associated with an earlier behaviour and engage in approach-oriented behaviours on a similar task.&lt;ref name="I forgive myself"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = I forgive myself, now I can study: How self-forgiveness for procrastinating can reduce future procrastination|url = http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0191886910000474|journal = Personality and Individual Differences|date = 2010-01-01|volume = 48|issue = 7|doi = 10.1016/j.paid.2010.01.029|first = Michael J.

==Forgiveness and Physical Health==
The correlation between forgiveness and [[physical health]] is a concept that has recently gained traction in research. Some studies claim that there is no correlation, either positive or negative between forgiveness and physical health, and others show a positive correlation.&lt;ref name="McCullough, Michael 2002"&gt;McCullough, Michael, and Charlotte Vanoyen. "The Psychology of Forgiveness." Handbook of Positive Psychology, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Evidence Supporting a Correlation===
Individuals with forgiveness as a [[personality trait]] have been shown to have overall better physical health. In a study on [[Interpersonal relationship|relationship]]s, regardless if someone was in a negative or [[positive relationship]], their physical health seemed to be influenced at least partially by their level of forgiveness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Berry | first1 = Jack W. | last2 = Everett | first2 = L. Jr. Worthington | year = 2001 | title = Forgivingness, Relationship Quality, Stress While Imagining Relationship Events, and Physical and Mental Health | url = | journal = Journal of Counseling Psychology | volume = 48 | issue = 4| pages = 447–55 | doi = 10.1037/0022-0167.48.4.447 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Individuals who make a decision to genuinely forgive someone are also shown to have better physical health. This is due to the relationship between forgiveness and stress reduction. Forgiveness is seen as preventing poor physical health and managing poor physical health.&lt;ref name="Worthington, Everett L. 2004"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Worthington | first1 = Everett L. | last2 = Scherer | first2 = Michael | year = 2004 | title = Forgiveness Is an Emotion-focused Coping Strategy That Can Reduce Health Risks and Promote Health Resilience: Theory, Review, and Hypotheses | url = | journal = Psychology &amp; Health | volume = 19 | issue = 3| pages = 385–405 | doi = 10.1080/0887044042000196674 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Specifically individuals who choose to forgive another after a transgression have lower [[blood pressure]] and lower [[cortisol]] levels than those who do not. This is theorized to be due to various direct and indirect influences of forgiveness, which point to forgiveness as an evolutionary trait. See [[Broaden-and-build|Broaden and Build Theory]].&lt;ref name="Worthington, Everett L. 2004" /&gt;

Direct influences include: Reducing [[hostility]] (which is inversely correlated with physical health), and the concept that unforgiveness may reduce the [[immune system]] because it puts stress on the individual. Indirect influences are more related to forgiveness as a personality trait and include: forgiving people may have more [[social support]] and less stressful marriages, and forgiveness may be related to personality traits that are correlated with physical health.&lt;ref name="Worthington, Everett L. 2004" /&gt;

Forgiveness may also be correlated with physical health because hostility is associated with poor coronary performance. Unforgiveness is as an act of hostility, and forgiveness as an act of letting go of hostility. Heart patients who are treated with therapy that includes forgiveness to reduce hostility have improved cardiac health compared to those who are treated with medicine alone.&lt;ref name="McCullough, Michael 2002" /&gt;
	
Forgiveness may also lead to better [[perceived]] physical health. This correlation applies to both self-forgiveness and other-forgiveness but is especially true of self-forgiveness. Individuals who are more capable of forgiving themselves have better perceived physical health.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wilson | first1 = T. | last2 = Milosevic | first2 = A. | last3 = Carroll | first3 = M. | last4 = Hart | first4 = K. | last5 = Hibbard | first5 = S. | year = 2008 | title = Physical Health Status in Relation to Self-Forgiveness and Other-Forgiveness in Healthy College Students | url = | journal = Journal of Health Psychology | volume = 13 | issue = 6| pages = 798–803 | doi = 10.1177/1359105308093863 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Criticisms===
{{expand section|date=January 2016}}
Forgiveness studies have been refuted by critics who claim that there is no direct correlation between forgiveness and physical health. Forgiveness, due to the reduction of directed anger, contributes to mental health and mental health contributes to physical health, but there is no evidence that forgiveness directly improves physical health. Most of the studies on forgiveness cannot isolate it as an [[independent variable]] in an individual's well-being, so it is difficult to prove [[causation (sociology)|causation]].&lt;ref name="McCullough, Michael E. 2000"&gt;McCullough, Michael E., Kenneth I. Pargament, and Carl E. Thoresen. Forgiveness: Theory, Research, and Practice. New York: Guilford Press, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, research into the correlation between physical health and forgiveness has been criticized for being too focused on unforgiveness. Research shows more about what hostility and unforgiveness contribute to poor health than it shows what forgiveness contributes to physical health.&lt;ref name="McCullough, Michael E. 2000" /&gt;

== Self-Forgiveness ==
Self-forgiveness happens in situations where an individual has done something that they perceive to be morally wrong and they consider themselves to be responsible for the wrongdoing.&lt;ref name="Ethical aspects of self-forgiveness"&gt;{{cite web|title = Ethical aspects of self-forgiveness|url = https://www.academia.edu/8498542/Ethical_aspects_of_self-forgiveness|accessdate = 2015-08-11|deadurl = no|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20151002033424/http://www.academia.edu/8498542/Ethical_aspects_of_self-forgiveness|archivedate = 2015-10-02|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Self-forgiveness is the overcoming of negative emotions that the wrongdoer associates with the wrongful action.&lt;ref name="Ethical aspects of self-forgiveness" /&gt; Negative emotions associated with wrongful action can include [[guilt (emotion)|guilt]], [[regret]], [[remorse]], [[blame]], [[shame]], [[self-hatred]] and/or [[self-contempt]].&lt;ref name="Ethical aspects of self-forgiveness" /&gt;

Major life events that include [[Psychological trauma|trauma]] can cause individuals to experience feelings of guilt or self-hatred.&lt;ref name="Self-forgiveness and forgiveness"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Self-forgiveness and forgiveness|url = http://doi.wiley.com/10.1111/j.1468-2265.2010.00611.x|journal = The Heythrop Journal|date = 2011-01-01|volume = 53|issue = 4|doi = 10.1111/j.1468-2265.2010.00611.x|first = ZENON|last = Szablowinski|pages=678–689}}&lt;/ref&gt; Humans have the ability to reflect on their behaviours to determine if their actions are [[moral]].&lt;ref name="Self-forgiveness and forgiveness" /&gt; In situations of trauma, humans can choose to self-forgive by allowing themselves to change and live a moral life.&lt;ref name="Self-forgiveness and forgiveness" /&gt; Self-forgiveness may be required in situations where the individual hurt themselves or in situations where they hurt others.&lt;ref name="Self-forgiveness and forgiveness" /&gt;

=== Therapeutic Model  ===
Individuals can unintentionally cause harm or offence to one another in everyday life. It is important for individuals to be able to recognize when this happens, and in the process of making amends, have the ability to self-forgive.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Fisher | first1 = M. L. | last2 = Exline | first2 = J. J. | year = 2010 | title = Moving toward self-forgiveness: Removing barriers  related to shame, guilt, and regret | url = | journal = Social and Personality Psychology Compass | volume = 4 | issue = 8| pages = 548–558 | doi = 10.1111/j.1751-9004.2010.00276.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; Specific research suggests that the ability to genuinely forgive one's self can be significantly beneficial to an individual's emotional as well as mental well-being.&lt;ref name="Cornish Wade 2015"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Cornish | first1 = M. A. | last2 = Wade | first2 = N. G. | year = 2015 | title = A therapeutic model of self-forgiveness with  intervention strategies for counselors | url = | journal = Journal of Counseling &amp; Development | volume = 93 | issue = 1| pages = 96–104 | doi = 10.1002/j.1556-6676.2015.00185.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; The research indicates that the ability to forgive one's self for past offences can lead to decreased feelings of negative emotions such as [[shame]] and [[guilt (emotion)|guilt]], and can increase the use of more positive practices such as self-kindness and [[self-compassion]].&lt;ref name="Cornish Wade 2015" /&gt; However, it has been indicated that it is possible for the process of self-forgiveness to be misinterpreted and therefore not accurately completed.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This could potentially lead to increased feelings of [[regret]] or [[self-blame]].&lt;ref name="Cornish Wade 2015" /&gt; In an attempt to avoid this, and increase the positive benefits associated with genuine self-forgiveness, a specific therapeutic model of self-forgiveness has been recommended, which can be used to encourage genuine self-forgiveness in offenders. The model that has been proposed has four key elements. These elements include '''responsibility''', '''remorse''', '''restoration''' and '''renewal'''.&lt;ref name="Cornish Wade 2015" /&gt; 
# The therapeutic model suggests '''responsibility''' as the first necessary step towards genuine self-forgiveness.&lt;ref name="Cornish Wade 2015" /&gt; Research advises that in order to avoid the negative affect associated with emotions such as overwhelming guilt or regret, offenders must first recognize that they have hurt another individual, and accept the responsibility necessary for their actions.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Cornish Wade 2015" /&gt; 
# Once the individual has accepted responsibility for their offences, it is natural for them to experience feelings of '''remorse''' or guilt. However, these feelings can be genuinely processed and expressed preceding the need for restoration.&lt;ref name="Cornish Wade 2015" /&gt; 
# The act of '''restoration''' allows the offending individual to make the necessary amends to the individual(s) they have hurt.  
# The final component in the model of self-forgiveness is '''renewal'''. The offending individual is able to genuinely forgive themself for their past transgressions and can engage in more positive and meaningful behaviors such as self-compassion and self-kindness.&lt;ref name="Cornish Wade 2015" /&gt;  
Despite the suggested model, research advises that the process of self-forgiveness is not always applicable for every individual.&lt;ref name="Cornish Wade 2015" /&gt; For example, individuals who have not actually caused others any harm or wrongdoing, but instead are suffering from negative emotions such as [[self-hatred]] or [[self-pity]], such as victims of assault, might attempt self-forgiveness for their perceived offences. However, this would not be the process necessary for them to make their amends.&lt;ref name="Cornish Wade 2015" /&gt; Additionally, offenders who continue to offend others while attempting to forgive themselves for past offences demonstrate a reluctance to genuinely complete the four stages necessary for self-forgiveness.&lt;ref name="Cornish Wade 2015" /&gt; Research suggests that it is important to first gather exterior information about the individual's perceived offences as well as their needs and motivation for self-forgiveness.&lt;ref name="Cornish Wade 2015" /&gt;

'''''Haumai''''' ([[Punjabi language|Punjabi]]: ਹਉਮੈ) is the concept of self-centeredness (egoism or ''[[Ahankar]]'') in [[Sikhism]].&lt;ref name=cole9/&gt; This concept was taught by [[Guru Nanak]], the founder of Sikhism, as the source of five evils: lust, covetousness, wrath, pride and attachment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Michael L. Hadley|title=The Spiritual Roots of Restorative Justice|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IntWqeMeU_oC&amp;pg=PA202|year=2001|publisher=State University of New York Press|isbn=978-0-7914-4851-9|page=202}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Sikh Gurus teachings, it is ''Haumai'' that leads to endless cycles of transmigration ([[Reincarnation|rebirth]]), and makes a person "manmukh".&lt;ref name=cole9/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=W.O. Cole|author2=Piara Singh Sambhi|title=Sikhism and Christianity: A Comparative Study|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=G8KMCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA75 |year=2016|publisher =Springer|isbn=978-1-349-23049-5 |pages=75–77}}&lt;/ref&gt; They state that one must turn away from ''Haumai'', become a "gurmukh" and follow the path of the Guru to receive God's grace.&lt;ref name=cole9&gt;{{cite book|author1=W. Owen Cole|author2=Piara Singh Sambhi|title=A Popular Dictionary of Sikhism: Sikh Religion and Philosophy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vcSRAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA9|year =2005|publisher=Routledge |isbn= 978-1-135-79760-7|pages=9–10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=W.H.

In Sikhism, the ''Haumai'' can only be overcome through meditation on God’s name (''[[Naam]]''), ''[[Simran (Sanskrit word)|Simran]]'' and ''[[Selfless service|Sewa]]''. It is a combination of the words ''Hau'' (ਹਉ) meaning "I" and ''Mai'' (ਮੈ) meaning "me".

The opposite of ''Haumai'' is humility (or ''[[Nimrata]]''), which is considered a virtue in Sikhism. [[Selfless service]] called ''Seva'', and complete submission to [[Waheguru]], or God is the Sikh path to liberation.&lt;ref name=cole9/&gt;

==Related concepts==
The concept of destructive self-centeredness and covetous attachment, similar to ''Haumai'' in Sikhism, is important in other Indian religions. In Buddhism, Hinduism and Jainism, it is referred to as "Ahankar'' (अहङ्कार), ''Ahammana'' (अहम्मान),  ''Ahammati'' (अहम्मति), ''Mamatta'' (ममता) and ''Maminkāra''.&lt;ref name="DavidsStede1921"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Thomas William Rhys Davids|author2=William Stede|title=Pali-English Dictionary|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0Guw2CnxiucC|year=1921|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass |isbn=978-81-208-1144-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Sir Monier Monier-Williams|title=A Sanskrit-English Dictionary: Etymologically and Philologically Arranged with Special Reference to Cognate Indo-European Languages|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=skU2AQAAMAAJ|year=1990|publisher=Oxford University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Imagined Communities: Reflections on the Origin and Spread of Nationalism''''' is a book by [[Benedict Anderson]]. It introduces a popular concept in political sciences and sociology, that of [[imagined communities]] named after it. It was first published in 1983, and reissued with additional chapters in 1991 and a further revised version in 2006.

[[Eric G.E. Zuelow]] described this book as "perhaps the most read book about [[nationalism]]".&lt;ref name=nationalismproject&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalismproject.org/books/a_b.htm|title=The Nationalism Project: Books by Author A-B|work=nationalismproject.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Nationalism and imagined communities==
According to Anderson's theory of imagined communities, the main causes of nationalism are the declining importance of privileged access to particular script languages (such as [[Latin]]) because of mass [[vernacular]] literacy;{{Citation needed|date=April 2015}} the movement to abolish the ideas of rule by divine right and hereditary monarchy;{{Citation needed|date=April 2015}} and the emergence of printing press capitalism ("the convergence of capitalism and print technology... standardization of national calendars, clocks and language was embodied in books and the publication of daily newspapers")&lt;ref name=nationalismproject/&gt;—all phenomena occurring with the start of the [[Industrial Revolution]].&lt;ref name=nationalismproject/&gt;

==Nation as an imagined community==
According to Anderson, [[nation]]s are [[Social constructionism|socially constructed]].&lt;ref name=sage&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sagepub.com/upm-data/9613_020037ch1and2.pdf|title=Benedict Anderson}}&lt;/ref&gt; For Anderson, the idea of the "nation" is relatively new and is a product of various socio-material forces. He defined a nation as "an imagined political community – and imagined as both inherently limited and sovereign".&lt;ref name="ic"&gt;{{cite book |title=Imagined communities: reflections on the origin and spread of nationalism |last=Anderson |first=Benedict R. O'G. |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=1991 |publisher=Verso |location=London |isbn=978-0-86091-546-1
 |pages=6–7 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4mmoZFtCpuoC |edition=Revised and extended.|accessdate= 5 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; As Anderson puts it, a nation "is imagined because the members of even the smallest nation will never know most of their fellow-members, meet them, or even hear of them, yet in the minds of each lives the image of their communion".&lt;ref name="ic"/&gt; While members of the community probably will never know each of the other members face to face, they may have similar interests or identify as part of the same nation. Members hold in their minds a mental image of their affinity: for example, the nationhood felt with other members of your nation when your "imagined community" participates in a larger event such as the [[Olympic Games]].

Nations are "limited" in that they have "finite, if elastic boundaries, beyond which lie other nations".&lt;ref name="ic"/&gt; They are "sovereign" since no dynastic monarchy can claim authority over them, in the modern period:
{{quote|text=[T]he concept was born in an age in which Enlightenment and Revolution were destroying the legitimacy of the divinely-ordained, hierarchical dynastic realm. Coming to maturity at a stage of human history when even the most devout adherents of any universal religion were inescapably confronted with the living pluralism of such religions, and the allomorphism [incongruence, divide] between each faith's ontological claims and territorial stretch, nations dream of being free, and, if under God, directly so. The gauge and emblem of this freedom is the sovereign state.&lt;ref name="ic"/&gt;}}
Even though we may never see anyone in our imagined community, we still know they are there through communication.

Finally, a nation is a [[community]] because,
{{quote|regardless of the actual inequality and exploitation that may prevail in each, the nation is always conceived as a deep, horizontal comradeship. Ultimately it is this fraternity that makes it possible, over the past two centuries, for so many millions of people, not so much to kill, as willingly to die for such limited imaginings.&lt;ref name="ic"/&gt;}}

An '''indiscrete category''' is a [[category (mathematics)|category]] ''C'' in which every [[hom-set]] ''C''(''X'', ''Y'') is a [[singleton (mathematics)|singleton]]. Every [[class (set theory)|class]] ''X'' gives rise to an indiscrete category whose objects are the elements of ''X'' with exactly one [[morphism]] between any two objects. Any two nonempty indiscrete categories are [[equivalence of categories|equivalent]] to each other. The [[functor]] from '''Set''' to '''Cat''' that sends a set to the corresponding indiscrete category is [[adjoint functors|right adjoint]] to the functor that sends a small category to its set of objects.

On March 17, 1808, [[Napoleon I]] created three decrees&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.be/books?id=S4RCAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA248 Pasinomie, XIV, p. 247]&lt;/ref&gt; in a failed attempt to bring equality and to integrate the Jews into French society after the Jewish Emancipation of 1790-1791. The '''Infamous Decree''', the third of the three, had adverse effects. Although the decrees´ aim was to further emancipate the Jews into equal citizenship, it restricted Jewish money lending (Catholics were not permitted to commit acts of usury, or the charging of interest as profit  on loans), it annulled all debts owed to Jews by non Jewish debtors and limited the residency of new Jewish peoples in France by   restricting all business activities while allowing work in agriculture and regular craftsmanship. The combination of these decrees severely weakened the financial position of once dominant rural French money lending Jews.&lt;ref&gt;Hyman, Paula E. The Jews of Modern France. London: University of California Press Ltd., 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical context==
[[Napoleon Bonaparte]] initially won allegiance of Jews when in 1797 he emancipated Jews in Ancona, Italy. He officially chose two High Priests of the Jewish Nation and seven councillors to the High Priests. He allegedly encouraged Jews to reclaim [[Jerusalem]] in 1799 with the help of his army in a letter to a rabbi in [[Jerusalem]], but the letter is suspected by many to be a forgery. He in no way acted against the Jews until the early 19th century,&lt;ref&gt;Schwarzfuchs, Simon. Napoleon, the Jews and the Sanhedrin. Boston: Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul, 1979.&lt;/ref&gt; when he passed a series of three decrees, one of which became known as the Infamous Decree. Some, such as author Franz Kobler, attribute [[Napoleon]]’s change in attitude to [[Napoleon]]’s new attachment to France and his newfound desire to protect the interests of the French people. When he was the hero of the Jews, he still was an "ardent patriot" of his home island of [[Corsica]].&lt;ref&gt;Kobler, Franz. Napoleon and the Jews. New York,: Schocken Books, 1975.&lt;/ref&gt;

In France, quite early in the Nineteenth Century, Jewish moneylenders were accused of [[usury]], in [[Alsace]], as well as of abusing other rights, which were given to them in their emancipation in 1791 under [[Louis XVI]]. Napoleon sided with popular French opinion. Though he desired equality for the Jews, he called them "the most despicable of men" and proclaimed he did not want their number to increase in an 1808 letter to his brother Jerome.&lt;ref&gt;Schwarzfuchs, Simon. Napoleon, the Jews and the Sanhedrin. Boston: Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul, 1979.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Napoleon]] issued an imperial decree in 1806 that suspended payment of debts owed to Jewish moneylenders for one year to warn against usury to the supposedly degenerate Jewish population and called a conference with Jewish leaders. The group he conferred with was dubbed the Great [[Sanhedrin]].&lt;ref&gt;Schwarzfuchs, Simon. Napoleon, the Jews, and the Sanhedrin. Boston: Routledge and Kegan Paul, 1979.&lt;/ref&gt; and met in 1807.&lt;ref&gt;Kobler, Franz. Napoleon and the Jews. New York: Schocken Books, 1975.&lt;/ref&gt;

Though the first meeting of the Great [[Sanhedrin]] on February 4, 1807 was ceremonial and solemn, the group was largely ineffective as nothing was done during the month they met to ameliorate the conditions on the Jews that would be imposed by the coming decrees. During the eight sessions, the Great [[Sanhedrin]] was forced to condone intermarriage between Frenchmen and Jews in order that the Jewish people might be absorbed into France,&lt;ref&gt;Jaher, Frederic Cople. The Jews and the Nation: Revolution, Emancipation, State Formantion, and the Liberal Paradigm in America and France. Princeton: Princeton University Press, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; since Jews were considered substandard citizens&lt;ref&gt;Schwarzfuchs, Simon. Napoleon, the Jews and the Sanhedrin. Boston: Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul, 1979.&lt;/ref&gt; and needed to be either absorbed or expelled. The group also had to support other actions to assimilate the Jews by removing their Jewish ties, such as approving military service to attach young Jewish men to France rather than to their religion and ethnic background. Such measures were a prelude to the passing of the three decrees on March 17, 1808.&lt;ref&gt;Jaher, Frederic Cople. The Jews and the Nation: Revolution, Emancipation, State Formation, and the Liberal Paradigm in America and France. Princeton: Princeton University Press, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Actual decree==
After [[Napoleon]]’s emancipation of the Jews he "wanted to mandate what some proponents of emancipation had hoped would happen, namely the total assimilation, or biological fusion of Jews with the rest of the French people."&lt;ref&gt;Hyman, Paula E. The Jews of Modern France. London: University of California Press Ltd., 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; To mandate the assimilation of Jews into French society, three decrees were issued on March 17, 1808.&lt;ref&gt;Hyman, Paula E. The Jews of Modern France. London: University of California Press Ltd., 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;

The "first two decrees restored order to the informal Jewish communities that had survived the revolution by establishing a hierarchical, centralized organization, under the aegis of the ministry of religions."&lt;ref&gt;Hyman, Paula E. The Jews of Modern France. London: University of California Press Ltd., 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; The first two decrees set up the [[Consistory (Judaism)|consistories]] which were designed to enforce the decrees. Some of the members also were a part of the Great [[Sanhedrin]] which met in 1807.&lt;ref&gt;Jaher, Frederic Cople. The Jews and the Nation: Revolution, Emancipation, State Formation, and the Liberal Paradigm in America and France. Princeton: Princeton University Press, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Consistory (Judaism)|consistories]] consisted of a grand rabbi, possibly another rabbi and three lay members who were residents of the town. The consistories acted to enforce [[Sanhedrin]] rules through the use of education; they also worked as informants to the government which was monitoring Jewish activity.&lt;ref&gt;Hyman, Paula E. The Jews of Modern France. London: University of California Press Ltd., 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; There was one consistory for every town that contained 2,000 or more Jews.&lt;ref&gt;Berkovitz, Jay R. Rites and Passages: The Beginnings of Modern Jewish Culture in France. Philadelphia: University of Philadelphia Press, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Infamous Decree, also known as the "third decree," presumed all Jews guilty of chicanery (the use of trickery to achieve a political, financial or legal purpose) unless proven innocent, and restricted Jewish commerce and money lending for a period of 10 years."&lt;ref&gt;Hyman, Paula E. The Jews of Modern France. London: University of California Press Ltd., 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;  This decree was put into place to end Jewish money lending. It annulled all debts owed to Jews by married women, minors, and soldiers and voided any loan that had interest rates exceeding 10 percent. This was an attempt by Napoleon to get rid of alleged [[usury]] by Jewish businessmen and to turn these former businessmen into craftsman and farmers to promote supposed equality between the Jews and non-Jews in France.&lt;ref&gt;Hyman, Paula E. The Jews of Modern France. London: University of California Press Ltd., 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; To encourage Jews to move into this niche, the Jews were restricted in changing residency to certain parts of France unless they "acquired rural property and devoted themselves to agriculture without entering into any commercial or business transactions."&lt;ref&gt;The Jew in the Modern World: A Documentary History, edited by Paul Mendes-Flohr and Jehuda Reinharz. New York: Oxford University Press Inc., 1995.&lt;/ref&gt; To keep tabs on businesses that had survived the new restrictions, the decree mandated that all business require a patent or license that had to be renewed yearly.&lt;ref&gt;Hyman, Paula E. The Jews of Modern France. London: University of California Press Ltd., 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; Not only did the decree hurt the Jews economically but it changed their military rights.&lt;ref&gt;Magnus, Shulamit S. Jewish Emancipation in a German City: Cologne, 1798-1871. Stanford: Stanford University Press, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;

The final restriction of the Jews was an attempt to strengthen their bond with the government and the country. The decree made it so that the Jewish conscripts (required enlistees of military) couldn’t find replacements for themselves when drafted like other Frenchmen were allowed to do.&lt;ref&gt;Magnus, Shulamit S. Jewish Emancipation in a German City: Cologne, 1798-1871. Stanford: Stanford University Press, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;

As a consequence of the first three decrees, another and final decree was implemented on July 20, 1808. This final decree declared that all Jews acquire a fixed family name to help the government and consistories supervise the Jews movements. They were restricted in their choice of names and weren’t allowed to pick names from the Hebrew Bible or any town names.&lt;ref&gt;Magnus, Shulamit S. Jewish Emancipation in a German City: Cologne, 1798-1871. Stanford: Stanford University Press, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;

The three decrees were set up to expire after 10 years and would only be continued if renewed after that period. In 1818 [[Louis XVIII]] opted to not renew the decree and thus it ended. [[Louis XVIII]] was thereafter known as the "liberator of Jews."&lt;ref&gt;Magnus, Shulamit S. Jewish Emancipation in a German City: Cologne, 1798-1871. Stanford: Stanford University Press, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;

==After effects==
After the decrees were not renewed after 10 years, Jews migrated into three main areas: Paris, Alsace and Lorraine. Indications of cultural and economical change can be seen in these areas. Although these changes were devastating to the economy of the Jews, they greatly increased the population and the distribution of the Jews.&lt;ref&gt;Hyman, Paula E. The Jews of Modern France. London: University of California Press Ltd., 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many Jews continued to live as lower class citizens. They were peddlers, clothes dealers, cattle merchants and small-scale commercial agents. The decree made business in the French Jewry more difficult. They could not have gone into farming or artistry because other bans took away their ability to own any land or belong to guilds. The Jews could not use their commercial skills because without the ability to own land, the Jewish businessmen could not experience any kind of expansion. But as time went by, more and more Jews began to go into artistry.&lt;ref&gt;Hyman, Paula E. The Jews of Modern France. London: University of California Press Ltd., 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; In Bordeaux, for example, 34 Jews worked as artisans and professionals. 66 Jews owned houses in the city and 39 were proprietors of rural land. Percentages of artisans in the city of [[Paris]] and [[Nancy, France|Nancy]] increased also. These different economical changes were accompanied by the union of Jewish youth in the public school system.&lt;ref&gt;Hyman, Paula E. The Jews of Modern France. London: University of California Press Ltd., 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;

There were many concerns with Jewish youth and the public school system. There was discrimination and talk of conversions. Only 10 percent of Jewish children attended public school in Alsace. One government Jewish official said, "Our schools are Catholic schools rather than public schools. Prayers according to the Roman religion are recited upon entering and leaving, the catechism of the same religion is taught there and the textbook used are of that same religion." &lt;ref&gt;Hyman, Paula E. The Jews of Modern France. London: University of California Press Ltd., 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1810, a few Jews went to local schools and moved to [[Lycée]], but many Jewish parents neglected their children’s education to prepare them into business. Jews gradually moved into public schools, and some even hired private tutors. Some parents home schooled their daughters to teach them music, dance and embroidery.&lt;ref&gt;Hyman, Paula E. The Jews of Modern France. London: University of California Press Ltd., 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;

The emancipation led to the redistribution of the Jewish population in France. Jews migrated to the cities and to communes where there had not previously been a Jewish population.&lt;ref&gt;Hyman, Paula E. The Jews of Modern France. London: University of California Press Ltd., 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; French Jews went to [[Paris]], by 1809 there were more than 2900 Jews there. The total Jewish population grew to more than 46,000 in Alsace.&lt;ref&gt;Hyman, Paula E. The Jews of Modern France. London: University of California Press Ltd., 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Information seeking behavior''' refers to the way people [[Information seeking|search for]] and utilize information.&lt;ref&gt;Fairer–Wessels, 1990, page 361.&lt;/ref&gt; The term was coined by [[Thomas D. Wilson]] in his 1981 paper, on the grounds that the then current 'information needs' was unhelpful as a basis for a research agenda, since 'need' could not be directly observed, while how people behaved in seeking information could be observed and investigated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wilson | first1 = T.D. | year =1981 | title = On user studies and information needs | url = | journal = [[Journal of Documentation]] | volume = 37 | issue = 1| pages = 3–15 | doi=10.1108/eb026702}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, there is increasing work in the information searching field that is relating behaviors to underlying needs.&lt;ref&gt;BJ Jansen, D Booth, B Smith (2009) [https://faculty.ist.psu.edu/jjansen/academic/pubs/jansen_using_the_taxonomy_of_cognitive_learning_to_model_online_searching.pdf Using the taxonomy of cognitive learning to model online searching]. [[Information Processing and Management|Information Processing &amp; Management]]. 45 (6), 643-663.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2000, [[Thomas D. Wilson|Wilson]] described information behavior as the totality of human behavior in relation to sources and channels of information, including both active and passive information-seeking, and information use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wilson|first=T.D.|title=Human Information Behaviour|journal=Informing Science|year=2000|volume=3|issue=2|pages=49–55}}&lt;/ref&gt; He described information seeking behavior as purposive seeking of information as a consequence of a need to satisfy some goal.  Information seeking behavior is the micro-level of behavior employed by the searcher in interacting with information systems of all kinds, be it between the seeker and the system, or the pure method of creating and following up on a search.

A variety of theories of information behavior – e.g. [[Zipf]]'s principle of least effort, [[Brenda Dervin]]'s sensemaking, [[Elfreda Chatman]]'s life in the round – seek to understand the processes that surround information seeking.&lt;ref name="Case, DO 2012"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Looking for information: a survey of research on information seeking, needs and behavior|author=Case, DO|publisher= Emerald |year=2012|isbn= 9781780526546}}&lt;/ref&gt; The analysis of the most cited publications on information behavior during the first years of this century shows its theoretical nature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Gonzalez-Teruel | first1 = A | last2 = González-Alcaide | first2 = G | last3 = Barrios | first3 = M | last4 = Abad-García | first4 = MF. | year = 2015 | title = Mapping recent information behavior research: an analysis of co-authorship and co-citation networks | url = | journal = Scientometrics | volume = 103 | issue = 2| pages = 687–705 | doi=10.1007/s11192-015-1548-z| hdl = 2445/100263 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Together with some works that have a constructivist focus, using references to Dewey, Kelly, Bruner and Vygotsky,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title= Seeking Meaning: A process approach to library and information services |author= Kuhlthau, CC |publisher= Ablex |year=1993|isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt; others mention sociological concepts, such as Bourdieu's habitus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Savolainen | first1 = R | year = 1995 | title = Everyday life information seeking approaching information seeking in the context of "way of life"  | url = | journal = Library &amp; Information Science Research | volume = 17 | issue = 13| pages = 259–294}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several adopt a constructionist-discursive focus,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = McKenzie | first1 = PJ | year = 2003 | title = A model of information practices in accounts of everyday-life information seeking  | url = | journal = Journal of Documentation | volume = 59 | issue = 1 | pages = 19–40 | doi=10.1108/00220410310457993}}&lt;/ref&gt; whereas some, such as Chatman,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Chatman | first1 = EA | year = 1996 | title = The impoverished life-world of outsiders  | url = | journal = Journal of the American Society for Information Science | volume = 47 | issue = 3| pages = 193–206 | doi=10.1002/(sici)1097-4571(199603)47:3&lt;193::aid-asi3&gt;3.3.co;2-m}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Chatman | first1 = EA | year = 1999 | title = A theory of life in the round | url = | journal = Journal of the American Society for Information Science | volume = 50 | issue = 3| pages = 207–217 | doi=10.1002/(sici)1097-4571(1999)50:3&lt;207::aid-asi3&gt;3.3.co;2-#}}&lt;/ref&gt; who can in general be described as using an ethnographic perspective, stand out for the quantity and diversity of references to social research.&lt;ref name="Case, DO 2012"/&gt; The term 'information behaviour' was also coined by Wilson and occasioned some controversy on its introduction,&lt;ref&gt;JESSE, discussion list http://listserv.utk.edu/cgi-bin/wa?A2=ind9912&amp;L=JESSE&amp;D=0&amp;P=3346&lt;/ref&gt; but now seems to have been adopted, not only by researchers in information science but also in other disciplines.

The digital world is changing human information behavior and process. Focused almost exclusively on information seeking and using, information receiving, a central modality of the process is generally overlooked.  As information seeking continues to migrate to the Internet, and artificial intelligence continues to advance the analysis of user behavior on the Internet across a range of user interactions, information receiving moves to the heart of the process, as systems  "learn" what users like, want and need, as well as their search habits.&lt;ref&gt;(1998 October) Giannini, Tula. ASIS Annual Conference, Pittsburgh, PA. "Information Receiving, a Primary Mode of the Information Process.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Models==

===Information search process (ISP)===

[[Information search process|ISP]] was proposed and developed by [[Carol Kuhlthau]].

An holistic framework based initially on research into high school students, but extended over time to include a diverse range of people, including those in the workplace. It examined the role of emotions, specifically uncertainty, in the information seeking process, concluding that many searches are abandoned due to an overwhelmingly high level of uncertainty.&lt;ref name="Kuhlthau"&gt;{{cite web|last=Kuhlthau|first=Carol|title=Carol Kuhlthau|url=http://wp.comminfo.rutgers.edu/ckuhlthau/|accessdate=2017-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

ISP is a 6-stage process, with each stage each encompassing 4 aspects;
* Cognitive (thoughts) – what is to be accomplished
* Affective (feelings) – what the searcher was feeling
* Actions (physical) – what the searcher did
* Strategies (physical) – what the searcher was trying to achieve&lt;ref name="Kuhlthau"/&gt;

===David Ellis===

Investigated the behavior of researchers in the physical and social sciences&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ellis|first=David|author2=Cox, Deborah, Hall, Katherine|title=A COMPARISON OF THE INFORMATION SEEKING PATTERNS OF RESEARCHERS IN THE PHYSICAL AND SOCIAL SCIENCES|journal=Journal of Documentation|year=1993|volume=49|issue=4|pages=356–369|doi=10.1108/eb026919}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and engineers and research scientists&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=David|first=Ellis|author2=Haugan, Merete|title=Modelling the information seeking patterns of engineers and research scientists in an industrial environment|journal=Journal of Documentation|year=1997|volume=53|issue=4|pages=384–403|doi=10.1108/eum0000000007204}}&lt;/ref&gt;  through semi-structured interviews using a [[grounded theory]] approach, with a focus on describing the activities rather than a process.

These initial investigations produced six key activities within the information seeking process:

*Starting (activities that form the information search)
*Chaining (backwards or forwards – following references in initial information sources)
*Browsing (semi-directed search)
*Differentiating (filtering and selecting sources based on judgement of quality and relevance)
*Monitoring ([[wikt:up-to-date|keeping track of developments in an area]])
*Extracting (systematic extraction of material of interest from sources)

Later studies by Ellis (focusing on academic researchers in other disciplines) resulted in the addition of two more activities;

* Verifying (checking accuracy)
* Ending (a final search, checking all material covered)

===Episodic model===

The episodic model was developed by [[Nicholas J. Belkin]].

The episodic model is based largely on intuition and insight and concentrates on interactions with information. There are 4 dimensions which characterize search behavior. These dimensions can be combined in 16 different ways.

* Method of interaction (scanning/searching)
* Goal of interaction (learning/selecting)
* Mode of retrieval (recognition/specification)
* Resource considered (information/meta-information)

===Anomalous state of knowledge (ASK)===

ASK was also developed by Nicholas J. Belkin.

An anomalous state of knowledge is one in which the searcher recognises a gap in the state of knowledge. This, his further hypothesis, is influential in studying why people start to search.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Belkin | first1 = Nicholas J | year = | title = Anomalous states of knowledge as a basis for information retrieval | url = | journal = Canadian Journal of Information and Library Science | volume = 5 | issue = | pages = 133–143 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Wilson's theory of information behavior===
{{main article|Wilson's model of information behavior|Thomas D. Wilson}}
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:P269fig3.jpg|thumb|alt=A simple diagram|A basic diagram illustrating Wilson's theory]] --&gt;
Thomas Wilson proposed that information behavior covers all aspects of human information behavior, whether active or passive.

Information ''Seeking'' behavior is the act of actively seeking information in order to answer a specific query.

Information ''Searching'' behavior is the behavior which stems from the searcher interacting with the system in question.  This system could be a technological one, such as the searcher interacting with a search engine, or a manual one, such as the searcher selecting which book is most pertinent to their query.

Information ''Use'' behavior pertains to the searcher adopting the knowledge they sought.

===Information foraging===
{{main article|Information foraging}}
Developed by [[Stuart Card]], [[Ed H. Chi]] and [[Peter Pirolli]].

This model is derived from anthropological theories and is comparable to foraging for food. Information seekers use clues (or information scents) such as links, summaries and images to estimate how close they are to target information. A scent must be obvious as users often browse aimlessly or look for specific information. Information foraging is descriptive of why and not how people search in particular ways.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Chi | first1 = E.H | last2 = Pirolli | first2 = P | last3 = Chen | first3 = K | last4 = Pitkow | first4 = J. | year = | title = Using information scent to model user information needs and actions and the web | url = | journal = In Proceedings of the SIGCHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems | volume = 2001 | issue = | pages = 490–497 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Life in the round===

Developed by [[Elfreda Chatman]].

She defines life in the round as a world of tolerated approximation. It acknowledges reality at its most routine, predictable enough that unless an initial problem should arise, there is no point in seeking information.&lt;ref name="Chatman"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Chatman | first1 = Elfreda | year = 1999| title = A theory of life in the round | url = | journal = The Journal of the American Society for Information Science | volume = 50 | issue = 3| pages = 207–217 | doi=10.1002/(sici)1097-4571(1999)50:3&lt;207::aid-asi3&gt;3.0.co;2-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chatman examined this principle within a small world: a world which imposes on its participants similar concerns and awareness of who is important; which ideas are relevant and whom to trust. Participants in this world are considered insiders.&lt;ref name="Chatman"/&gt;

Chatman focused her study on women at a maximum security prison. She learned that over time, prisoner's private views were assimilated to a communal acceptance of life in the round: a small world perceived in accordance with agreed upon standards and communal perspective. Members who live in the round will not cross the boundaries of their world to seek information unless it is critical; there is a collective expectation that information is relevant; or life lived in the round no longer functions. The world outside prison has secondary importance to inmates who are absent from this reality which is changing with time.&lt;ref name="Chatman"/&gt;

===Sensemaking===
{{main article|Sensemaking}}
[[Brenda Dervin]] developed the concept of sensemaking.  Sensemaking considers how we (attempt to) make sense of uncertain situations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Klein | first1 = G. | last2 = Moon | first2 = B. | last3 = Hoffman | first3 = R.F. | year = 2006| title = Making sense of sensemaking I: alternative perspectives | url = | journal = IEEE Intelligent Systems | volume = 21 | issue = 4| pages = 70–73 | doi=10.1109/mis.2006.75}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Her description of Sensemaking consisted of the definition of how we interpret information to use for our own information related decisions.

Brenda Dervin described sensemaking as a method through which people make sense of their worlds in their own language.

===Principle of least effort===
This principle explains that information seekers prioritise the most convenient path to acceptable information.&lt;ref&gt;Case Donald O. "Principle of least effort,"''Theories Of Information Behavior'', Karen Fisher ed. p50.&lt;/ref&gt;
{{main article|Principle of least effort}}

===Navigators and explorers===
This compares the internet search methods of experienced information seekers (navigators) and inexperienced information seekers (explorers). Navigators revisit domains; follow sequential searches and have few deviations or regressions within their search patterns and interactions. Explorers visit many domains; submit many questions and their search trails branch frequently.&lt;ref&gt;White, Ryen W and Drucker, Steven M "Investigating behavioural variability in web search," ''16th International World Wide Web Conference (WWW 2007)''&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Information sources: Other people and/or information repositories ===
Robinson's (2010)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Robinson | first1 = M. A. | year = 2010 | title = An empirical analysis of engineers' information behaviors | url = | journal = Journal of the American Society for Information Science and Technology | volume = 61 | issue = 4| pages = 640–658 | doi = 10.1002/asi.21290 }}&lt;/ref&gt; research suggests that when seeking information at work, people rely on both other people and information repositories (e.g., documents and databases), and spend similar amounts of time consulting each (7.8% and 6.4% of work time, respectively; 14.2% in total). However, of theoretical interest, the distribution of time among the constituent information seeking stages differs depending on the source. When consulting other people, people spend less time locating the information source and information within that source, similar time understanding the information, and more time problem solving and decision making, than when consulting information repositories. Furthermore, the research found that people spend substantially more time receiving information passively (i.e., information that they have not requested) than actively (i.e., information that they have requested), and this pattern is also reflected when they provide others with information.

==Similarities between models==
A review of the literature on information seeking behavior shows that information seeking has generally been accepted as dynamic and non-linear (Foster, 2005; Kuhlthau 2006). People experience the [[information search process]] as an interplay of thoughts, feelings and actions ([[Carol Kuhlthau|Kuhlthau, 2006]]).

Information seeking has been found to be linked to a variety of interpersonal communication behaviors beyond question-asking, to include strategies such as candidate answers.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}

A search for information may be linked to [[decision making]]. The decision involved may vary from a trivial personal matter to a decision which affects billions or may have cumulative economic or political effects as individual buying or voting decisions may.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Looking for information: a survey of research on information seeking, needs and behavior|author=Case, Donald O.|publisher=Academic Press|year=2002|isbn=978-0-12-369430-0|page=10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The visceral need is expressed as the actual information need before it has been expressed.  The conscious need is the need once it has been recognized by the seeker.  The formalized need is the statement of the need and the compromised need is the query when related to the information system.

[http://www.jisc.ac.uk/ JISC]'s study of the Google Generation&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=JISC|title=The Google Generation|url=http://www.jisc.ac.uk/whatwedo/programmes/resourcediscovery/googlegen.aspx}}&lt;/ref&gt; detailed six different characteristics of online information seeking behavior;

* horizontal information seekers
* navigation
* viewers
* squirreling behavior
* diverse information seekers
* checking information seekers.

Horizontal information seeking is the method sometimes referred to as "[[Skimming (reading)|skimming]]".  An information seeker who skims views a couple of pages, then subsequently follows other links without necessarily returning to the initial sites.  Navigators, as might be expected, spend their time finding their way around.  Wilson found that users of e-book or e-journal sites were most likely spend, on average, a mere four to eight minutes viewing said sites.  Squirreling behavior relates to users who download lots of documents but might not necessarily end up reading them.  Checking information seekers assess the host in order to ascertain trustworthiness.  The bracket of users named diverse information seekers are users whose behavior differs from the above sectors.

'''Internet censorship''' is the [[censorship|control or suppression]] of what can be accessed, published, or viewed on the [[Internet]] enacted by regulators, or on their own initiative. Individuals and organizations may engage in [[self-censorship]] for moral, religious, or business reasons, to conform to societal norms, due to intimidation, or out of fear of legal or other consequences.&lt;ref name="NYT-20181015"&gt;{{cite news |author=The Editorial Board |title=There May Soon Be Three Internets. America’s Won’t Necessarily Be the Best. - A breakup of the web grants privacy, security and freedom to some, and not so much to others. |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/15/opinion/internet-google-china-balkanization.html |date=15 October 2018 |work=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=16 October 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT-20140311"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Schmidt |first1=Eric E. |last2=Cohen |first2=Jared |authorlink1=Eric Schmidt |authorlink2=Jared Cohen |title=The Future of Internet Freedom |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/12/opinion/the-future-of-internet-freedom.html |date=11 March 2014 |work=[[New York Times]] |accessdate=11 March 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The extent of Internet censorship varies on a country-to-country basis. While most democratic countries have moderate Internet censorship, other countries go as far as to limit the access of information such as news and suppress discussion among citizens.&lt;ref name="NYT-20140311" /&gt; Internet censorship also occurs in response to or in anticipation of events such as elections, protests, and riots. An example is the increased censorship due to the events of the [[Arab Spring]]. Other areas of censorship include copyrights, defamation, harassment, and obscene material.

Support for and opposition to Internet censorship also varies. In a [[#Internet Society's Global Internet User Survey|2012 Internet Society survey]] 71% of respondents agreed that "censorship should exist in some form on the Internet". In the same survey 83% agreed that "access to the Internet should be considered a basic human right" and 86% agreed that "[[freedom of expression]] should be guaranteed on the Internet". Perception of internet censorship in the US is largely based on the First Amendment and the right for expansive free speech and access to content without regard to the consequences.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Goldberg|first=Erica|date=|title=FREE SPEECH CONSEQUENTIALISM|url=www.jstor.org/stable/43783393|journal=Columbia Law Review|volume=116|pages=687-694|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  According to [[GlobalWebIndex]], over 400 million people use [[virtual private network]]s to circumvent censorship or for increased user privacy.&lt;ref name="Guardian 5 December 2014"/&gt;

==Overview==
Many of the challenges associated with Internet censorship are similar to those for offline censorship of more traditional media such as newspapers, magazines, books, music, radio, television, and film. One difference is that national borders are more permeable online: residents of a country that bans certain information can find it on websites hosted outside the country. Thus censors must work to prevent access to information even though they lack physical or legal control over the websites themselves. This in turn requires the use of technical censorship methods that are unique to the Internet, such as site blocking and content filtering.&lt;ref name=UNESCO-2011/&gt;

Views about the feasibility and effectiveness of Internet censorship have evolved in parallel with the development of the Internet and censorship technologies:
* A 1993 ''Time Magazine'' article quotes computer scientist [[John Gilmore (activist)|John Gilmore]], one of the founders of the [[Electronic Frontier Foundation]], as saying "The Net interprets censorship as damage and routes around it."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chemie.fu-berlin.de/outerspace/internet-article.html "First Nation in Cyberspace"], Philip Elmer-Dewitt, ''Time'', 6 December 1993, No.49&lt;/ref&gt;
* In November 2007, "Father of the Internet" [[Vint Cerf]] stated that he sees government control of the Internet failing because the Web is almost entirely privately owned.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.reuters.com/article/reutersEdge/idUSN1420689320071114?sp=true "Cerf sees government control of Internet failing"], Pedro Fonseca, Reuters, 14 November 2007&lt;/ref&gt;
* A report of research conducted in 2007 and published in 2009 by the [[Berkman Center for Internet &amp; Society]] at Harvard University stated that: "We are confident that the [ [[censorship circumvention]] ] tool developers will for the most part keep ahead of the governments' blocking efforts", but also that "...we believe that less than two percent of all filtered Internet users use circumvention tools".&lt;ref&gt;[http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/sites/cyber.law.harvard.edu/files/2007_Circumvention_Landscape.pdf ''2007 Circumvention Landscape Report: Methods, Uses, and Tools''], Hal Roberts, Ethan Zuckerman, and John Palfrey, Beckman Center for Internet &amp; Society at Harvard University, March 2009&lt;/ref&gt;
* In contrast, a 2011 report by researchers at the [[Oxford Internet Institute]] published by [[UNESCO]] concludes "... the control of information on the Internet and Web is certainly feasible, and technological advances do not therefore guarantee greater freedom of speech."&lt;ref name=UNESCO-2011/&gt;
* Dr Shashi Tharoor in quarterly lecture series programme organized by a think tank based in India, Centre for Public Policy Research stated that "avenues of expressing our views and opinions having amplified multifold via digital media, freedom of expression comes immense responsibility"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.newindianexpress.com/cities/kochi/2012/sep/15/tharoor-calls-for-caution-in-freedom-of-expression-406318.html|title=Tharoor calls for caution in freedom of expression|last=|first=|date=|work=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:Internet blocked in Iran.jpg|thumb|262x262px|Error message used to block content deemed harmful by government in Iran.]]

Blocking and filtering can be based on relatively static [[blacklist]]s or be determined more dynamically based on a real-time examination of the information being exchanged. Blacklists may be produced manually or automatically and are often not available to non-customers of the blocking software. Blocking or filtering can be done at a centralized national level, at a decentralized sub-national level, or at an institutional level, for example in libraries, universities or [[Internet cafes]].&lt;ref name="NYT-20140311" /&gt; Blocking and filtering may also vary within a country across different ISPs.&lt;ref name=Chadwick-2009&gt;{{Cite book| last = ed. Chadwick| first = Andrew| title = Routledge handbook of Internet politics| publisher = Taylor and Francis| series = Routledge international handbooks| year = 2009| pages = 332 | url = https://books.google.com/books/about/Routledge_handbook_of_Internet_politics.html?id=GJdfuGSa1xUC| isbn = 978-0-415-42914-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Countries may filter sensitive content on an ongoing basis and/or introduce temporary filtering during key time periods such as elections. In some cases the censoring authorities may surreptitiously block content to mislead the public into believing that censorship has not been applied. This is achieved by returning a fake [[404 error|"Not Found"]] error message when an attempt is made to access a blocked website.&lt;ref name=Faris-2008/&gt;

Unless the censor has total control over all Internet-connected computers, such as in [[Internet censorship in North Korea|North Korea]] (who employ an [[intranet]] that only privileged citizens can access), or [[Internet censorship in cuba|Cuba]], total censorship of information is very difficult or impossible to achieve due to the underlying distributed technology of the Internet. [[Pseudonymity]] and [[data haven]]s (such as [[Freenet]]) protect [[free speech]] using technologies that guarantee material cannot be removed and prevents the identification of authors. Technologically savvy users can often find ways to access blocked content. Nevertheless, blocking remains an effective means of limiting access to sensitive information for most users when censors, such as those in [[Internet censorship in the People's Republic of China|China]], are able to devote significant resources to building and maintaining a comprehensive censorship system.&lt;ref name=UNESCO-2011/&gt;

The term "[[splinternet]]" is sometimes used to describe the effects of national [[Firewall (computing)|firewalls]]. The verb "[[River crab (Internet slang)|rivercrab]]" colloquially refers to censorship of the Internet, particularly in Asia.&lt;ref name="RC"&gt;{{Cite web|author=Lao Wai|title=I've Been Rivercrabbed!|work=An American In Beijing|date=21 October 2007|url=http://americaninbeijing.blogspot.com/2007/10/ive-been-rivercrabbed.html|accessdate=28 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Content suppression methods ==

===Technical censorship===

As per Hoffmann, different methods are used to block certain websites or pages including [[DNS poisoning]], blocking access to [[IP address|IP]]s, analyzing and [[URL|filtering URLs]], inspecting filter packets and resetting connections.&lt;ref name="howto"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Hoffman |first1=Chris |title=How the “Great Firewall of China” Works to Censor China’s Internet |url=https://www.howtogeek.com/162092/htg-explains-how-the-great-firewall-of-china-works/ |website=https://www.howtogeek.com |publisher=How to geek |accessdate=15 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

====Approaches====
Internet content is subject to technical censorship methods, including:&lt;ref name="NYT-20140311" /&gt;&lt;ref name=UNESCO-2011&gt;[http://www.unesco.org/new/en/communication-and-information/resources/publications-and-communication-materials/publications/full-list/freedom-of-connection-freedom-of-expression-the-changing-legal-and-regulatory-ecology-shaping-the-internet/ ''Freedom of connection, freedom of expression: the changing legal and regulatory ecology shaping the Internet''], Dutton,  March 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

*'''Internet Protocol (IP) address blocking''': Access to a certain [[IP address]] is denied. If the target Web site is hosted in a [[Shared web hosting service|shared hosting server]], all websites on the same server will be blocked. This affects IP-based protocols such as [[Hypertext Transfer Protocol|HTTP]], [[File Transfer Protocol|FTP]] and [[Post Office Protocol|POP]]. A typical circumvention method is to find [[Proxy server|proxies]] that have access to the target websites, but proxies may be jammed or blocked, and some Web sites, such as Wikipedia (when editing), also block proxies. Some large websites such as [[Google]] have allocated additional IP addresses to circumvent the block, but later the block was extended to cover the new addresses. Due to challenges with [[geolocation]], [[geo-blocking]] is normally implemented via IP address blocking.
*'''Domain name system (DNS) filtering and redirection''': Blocked [[domain name]]s are not resolved, or an incorrect IP address is returned via [[DNS hijacking]] or other means. This affects all IP-based protocols such as HTTP, FTP and POP. A typical circumvention method is to find an alternative [[DNS resolver]] that resolves domain names correctly, but domain name servers are subject to blockage as well, especially IP address blocking. Another workaround is to bypass DNS if the IP address is obtainable from other sources and is not itself blocked. Examples are modifying the [[Hosts file]] or typing the IP address instead of the domain name as part of a URL given to a [[Web browser]].
*'''Uniform Resource Locator (URL) filtering''': [[Uniform Resource Locator|URL]] strings are scanned for target keywords regardless of the domain name specified in the URL. This affects the [[Hypertext Transfer Protocol|HTTP]] protocol. Typical circumvention methods are to use [[percent-encoding|escaped characters]] in the URL, or to use encrypted protocols such as [[Virtual private network|VPN]] and [[Transport Layer Security|TLS/SSL]].&lt;ref&gt;For an example, see [[Wikipedia:Advice to users using Tor to bypass the Great Firewall]]&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Packet filtering''': Terminate [[Transmission Control Protocol|TCP]] [[Packet (information technology)|packet]] transmissions when a certain number of controversial keywords are detected. This affects all TCP-based protocols such as HTTP, FTP and POP, but [[Search engine results page]]s are more likely to be censored. Typical circumvention methods are to use encrypted connections – such as VPN and TLS/SSL – to escape the HTML content, or by reducing the [[Internet protocol suite|TCP/IP]] [[Protocol stack|stack]]'s [[Maximum transmission unit|MTU]]/[[Maximum segment size|MSS]] to reduce the amount of text contained in a given packet.
*'''Connection reset''': If a previous [[Transmission Control Protocol|TCP]] connection is blocked by the filter, future connection attempts from both sides can also be blocked for some variable amount of time. Depending on the location of the block, other users or websites may also be blocked, if the communication is [[Routing|routed]] through the blocking location. A circumvention method is to ignore the reset packet sent by the firewall.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zdnetasia.com/news/security/0,39044215,39372326,00.htm|title=Topics - ZDNet|work=ZDNet|accessdate=5 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Network disconnection''': A technically simpler method of Internet censorship is to completely cut off all routers, either by software or by hardware (turning off machines, pulling out cables). This appears to have been the case on 27/28 January 2011 during the [[2011 Egyptian protests]], in what has been widely described as an "unprecedented" internet block.&lt;ref name="jamescowie_techdetails_Egyptfullblock"&gt;{{cite web|last=Cowie |first=James |title=Egypt Leaves the Internet |publisher=Renesys |url=http://research.dyn.com/2011/01/egypt-leaves-the-internet/ |accessdate=28 January 2011 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5w51j0pga?url=http://www.renesys.com/blog/2011/01/egypt-leaves-the-internet.shtml |archivedate=28 January 2011 |deadurl=no |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="IDGnews_Egyptfullblock"&gt;{{cite news|first=Jeremy |last=Kirk |title=With Wired Internet Locked, Egypt Looks to the Sky |date=28 January 2011 |publisher=IDG News/[[PC World (magazine)|PC World]] |url=https://www.pcworld.com/article/218064/with_wired_internet_locked_egypt_looks_to_the_sky.html |accessdate=28 January 2011 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5w518Yu9B?url=http://www.pcworld.com/businesscenter/article/218064/with_wired_internet_locked_egypt_looks_to_the_sky.html |archivedate=28 January 2011 |deadurl=no |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; About 3500 [[Border Gateway Protocol]] (BGP) routes to Egyptian networks were shut down from about 22:10 to 22:35 UTC 27 January.&lt;ref name="jamescowie_techdetails_Egyptfullblock" /&gt; This full block was implemented without cutting off major intercontinental [[fibre optics|fibre-optic]] links, with Renesys stating on 27 January, "Critical European-Asian fiber-optic routes through Egypt appear to be unaffected for now."&lt;ref name="jamescowie_techdetails_Egyptfullblock" /&gt; Full blocks also occurred in [[Internet censorship in Myanmar|Myanmar/Burma]] in 2007,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://opennet.net/research/bulletins/013|title=Pulling the Plug: A Technical Review of the Internet Shutdown in Burma|work=opennet.net|accessdate=5 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Free speech in the media during the 2011 Libyan civil war|Libya]] in 2011,&lt;ref name=Libya-RWB-2011&gt;{{cite web|title=Journalists confined to their hotels, Internet disconnected|url=http://en.rsf.org/journalists-confined-to-their-04-03-2011,39681.html|work=Journalists confined to their hotels, Internet disconnected|publisher=Reporters Without Borders|accessdate=21 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Internet censorship in Syria|Syria]] during the [[Syrian civil war]].

*'''Portal censorship''' and '''search result removal''': Major portals, including [[search engine]]s, may exclude web sites that they would ordinarily include. This renders a site invisible to people who do not know where to find it. When a major portal does this, it has a similar effect as censorship. Sometimes this exclusion is done to satisfy a legal or other requirement, other times it is purely at the discretion of the portal. For example, [https://www.google.com/ Google.de] and [https://www.google.com/ Google.fr] remove [[Neo-Nazism|Neo-Nazi]] and other listings in compliance with German and French law.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cnet.com/news/google-excluding-controversial-sites/ Google excluding controversial sites], Declan McCullagh, CNET News, 23 October 2002, 8:55&amp;nbsp;pm PDT. Retrieved 22 April 2007 00:40 UTC&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Computer network attacks''': [[Denial-of-service attack]]s and attacks that deface opposition websites can produce the same result as other blocking techniques, preventing or limiting access to certain websites or other online services, although only for a limited period of time. This technique might be used during the lead up to an election or some other sensitive period. It is more frequently used by non-state actors seeking to disrupt services.&lt;ref&gt;[http://opennet.net/emergence-open-and-organized-pro-government-cyber-attacks-middle-east-case-syrian-electronic-army "The Emergence of Open and Organized Pro-Government Cyber Attacks in the Middle East: The Case of the Syrian Electronic Army"], Helmi Noman, OpenNet Initiative, May 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

====Over- and under-blocking====
Technical censorship techniques are subject to both over- and under-blocking since it is often impossible to always block exactly the targeted content without blocking other permissible material or allowing some access to targeted material and so providing more or less protection than desired.&lt;ref name=UNESCO-2011/&gt; An example is blocking an IP-address of a server that hosts multiple websites, which prevents access to all of the websites rather than just those that contain content deemed offensive.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theregister.co.uk/2003/09/24/india_blocks_yahoo_groups/ "India blocks Yahoo! Groups"], Andrew Orlowski, The Register, 24 September 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

Writing in 2009 [[Ronald Deibert]], professor of political science at the [[University of Toronto]] and co-founder and one of the principal investigators of the [[OpenNet Initiative]], and, writing in 2011, Evgeny Morzov, a visiting scholar at [[Stanford University]] and an Op-Ed contributor to the ''[[New York Times]]'', explain that companies in the United States, Finland, France, Germany, Britain, Canada, and South Africa are in part responsible for the increasing sophistication of online content filtering worldwide. While the off-the-shelf [[filtering software]] sold by Internet security companies are primarily marketed to businesses and individuals seeking to protect themselves and their employees and families, they are also used by governments to block what they consider sensitive content.&lt;ref name=Chadwick2009-1&gt;{{Cite book| last = ed.

Among the most popular filtering software programs is [[SmartFilter]] by [[Secure Computing]] in California, which was bought by [[McAfee]] in 2008.

On 12 March 2013 in a ''Special report on Internet Surveillance'', Reporters Without Borders named five "Corporate Enemies of the Internet": [[Amesys]] (France), [[Blue Coat Systems]] (U.S.), [[FinFisher|Gamma]] (UK and Germany), [[Hacking Team]] (Italy), and Trovicor (Germany).

In a U.S. lawsuit filed in May 2011, [[Cisco Systems]] is accused of helping the [[People's Republic of China|Chinese Government]] build a firewall, known widely as the [[Golden Shield]], to censor the Internet and keep tabs on dissidents. Cisco said it had made nothing special for China. Cisco is also accused of aiding the Chinese government in monitoring and apprehending members of the banned [[Falun Gong]] group.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/03/technology/group-says-it-has-new-evidence-of-ciscos-misdeeds-in-china.html "Group Says It Has New Evidence of Cisco’s Misdeeds in China"], Somini Sengupta, ''New York Times'', 2 September 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

Many filtering programs allow blocking to be configured based on dozens of categories and sub-categories such as these from Websense: "abortion" (pro-life, pro-choice), "adult material" (adult content, lingerie and swimsuit, nudity, sex, sex education), "advocacy groups" (sites that promote change or reform in public policy, public opinion, social practice, economic activities, and relationships), "drugs" (abused drugs, marijuana, prescribed medications, supplements and unregulated compounds), "religion" (non-traditional religions occult and folklore, traditional religions), ....&lt;ref name=Noman-2011/&gt; The blocking categories used by the filtering programs may contain errors leading to the unintended blocking of websites.&lt;ref name=Chadwick2009-1/&gt; The blocking of [[DailyMotion]] in early 2007 by Tunisian authorities was, according to the [[OpenNet Initiative]], due to Secure Computing wrongly categorizing DailyMotion as pornography for its SmartFilter filtering software. It was initially thought that Tunisia had blocked DailyMotion due to satirical videos about human rights violations in Tunisia, but after Secure Computing corrected the mistake access to DailyMotion was gradually restored in Tunisia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = ed.

Organizations such as the [[Global Network Initiative]], the [[Electronic Frontier Foundation]], [[Amnesty International]], and the [[American Civil Liberties Union]] have successfully lobbied some vendors such as [[Websense]] to make changes to their software, to refrain from doing business with repressive governments, and to educate schools who have inadvertently reconfigured their filtering software too strictly.&lt;ref name="riaclu"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.riaclu.org/20050418.html | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20081205070114/http://www.riaclu.org/20050418.html | title = R.I.

Vendors often consider information about what sites and content is blocked valuable intellectual property that is not made available outside the company, sometimes not even to the organizations purchasing the filters. Thus by relying upon out-of-the-box filtering systems, the detailed task of deciding what is or is not acceptable speech may be outsourced to the commercial vendors.&lt;ref name=Noman-2011/&gt;

==Circumvention==
{{Main|Internet censorship circumvention}}

Internet censorship circumvention is the processes used by technologically savvy Internet users to bypass the technical aspects of Internet filtering and gain access to the otherwise censored material. Circumvention is an inherent problem for those wishing to censor the Internet because filtering and blocking do not remove content from the Internet, but instead block access to it.  Therefore, as long as there is at least one publicly accessible uncensored system, it will often be possible to gain access to the otherwise censored material. However circumvention may not be possible by non-tech-savvy users, so blocking and filtering remain effective means of censoring the Internet access of large numbers of users.&lt;ref name=UNESCO-2011/&gt;

Different techniques and resources are used to bypass Internet censorship, including [[Proxy server|proxy websites]], [[virtual private network]]s, [[sneakernet]]s, and circumvention software tools. Solutions have differing ease of use, speed, security, and risks. Most, however, rely on gaining access to an Internet connection that is not subject to filtering, often in a different jurisdiction not subject to the same censorship laws. According to [[GlobalWebIndex]], over 400 million people use virtual private networks to circumvent censorship or for an increased level of privacy.&lt;ref name="Guardian 5 December 2014"/&gt; The majority of circumvention techniques are not suitable for day to day use.&lt;ref&gt;Roberts, H., Zuckerman, E., &amp; Palfrey, J. (2009, March). 2007 Circumvention Landscape Report: Methods, Uses, and Tools (Rep.). Retrieved March 18, 2016, from The Berkman Center for Internet &amp; Society at Harvard University.
&lt;/ref&gt;

There are risks to using circumvention software or other methods to bypass Internet censorship. In some countries, individuals that gain access to otherwise restricted content may be violating the law and if caught can be expelled, fired, jailed, or subject to other punishments and loss of access.&lt;ref name="NYT-20140311" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://en.cship.org/wiki/Risks "Risks"], ''Internet censorship wiki''. Retrieved 2 September 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2011 the ''New York Times'' reported that the U.S. is engaged in a "global effort to deploy 'shadow' Internet and mobile phone systems that dissidents can use to undermine repressive governments that seek to silence them by censoring or shutting down telecommunications networks."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/12/world/12internet.html?pagewanted=all "U.S. Underwrites Internet Detour Around Censors"], James Glanz and John Markoff, ''New York Times'', 12 June 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

Another way to circumvent Internet censorship is to physically go to an area where the Internet is not censored. In 2017 a so-called "Internet refugee camp" was established by IT workers in the village of Bonako, just outside an area of Cameroon where the Internet is regularly blocked.&lt;ref&gt;https://qz.com/942879/an-internet-shutdown-in-cameroon-has-forced-startups-to-create-an-internet-refugee-camp-in-bonako-village/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2018/01/cameroon-internet-shutdowns-cost-anglophones-millions-180123202824701.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Common targets==
There are several motives or rationales for Internet filtering: politics and power, social norms and morals, and security concerns. Protecting existing economic interests is an additional emergent motive for Internet filtering. In addition, networking tools and applications that allow the sharing of information related to these motives are themselves subjected to filtering and blocking. And while there is considerable variation from country to country, the blocking of web sites in a local language is roughly twice that of web sites available only in English or other international languages.&lt;ref name=Faris-2008&gt;[http://opennet.net/sites/opennet.net/files/Deibert_02_Ch01_005-028.pdf "Measuring Global Internet Filtering"], Robert Faris and Nart Villeneuve, in [http://mitpress.mit.edu/catalog/item/default.asp?ttype=2&amp;tid=11329 ''Access Denied: The Practice and Policy of Global Internet Filtering''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090226100258/http://mitpress.mit.edu/catalog/item/default.asp?ttype=2&amp;tid=11329 |date=26 February 2009 }}, Ronald Deibert, John Palfrey, Rafal Rohozinski, and Jonathan Zittrain, eds., MIT Press (Cambridge), 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

===Politics and power===
Censorship directed at political opposition to the ruling government is common in authoritarian and repressive regimes. Some countries block web sites related to religion and minority groups, often when these movements represent a threat to the ruling regimes.&lt;ref name=Faris-2008/&gt;

Examples include:
* Political blogs and web sites&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.news.com/Blog-censorship-gains-support/2100-1028_3-5670096.html |title=Blog censorship gains support |work=CNET |accessdate=5 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''[[Lèse majesté]]'' sites, sites with content that offends the dignity of or challenges the authority of a reigning [[Sovereignty|sovereign]] or of a [[Sovereign state|state]]
* [[Falun Gong]] and [[Tibetan exile]] group sites in [[Internet censorship in the People's Republic of China|China]] or [[Buddhist]], [[Cao Dai]] faith, and indigenous [[Hill tribes#South-East Asia|hill tribes]] sites in [[Internet censorship in Vietnam|Vietnam]]

* Sites that comment on political parties that oppose the current government of a country&lt;ref name=time20151123/&gt;

* Sites that comment on minorities or [[LGBT]] issues&lt;ref name=time20151123/&gt;

===Social norms===
Social filtering is censorship of topics that are held to be antithetical to accepted societal norms.&lt;ref name=Faris-2008/&gt; In particular censorship of [[child pornography]] and to [[think of the children|protect children]] enjoys very widespread public support and such content is subject to censorship and other restrictions in most countries.

Examples include:
* Sites that include [[hate speech]] inciting [[racism]], [[sexism]], [[homophobia]], or other forms of bigotry
* Sites seen as promoting [[Substance abuse|illegal drug use]] ([[Erowid]]){{Citation needed|date=January 2018}}
* [[Eroticism|Sex and erotic]], [[fetishism]], prostitution, and [[Anti-pornography movement|pornographic]] sites
* [[Child pornography]] and [[pedophile]] related sites (see also [[CIRCAMP]])
* Gambling sites
* Sites encouraging or inciting violence&lt;ref name=time20151123&gt;{{cite magazine |title=WHAT IT TAKES TO FORGIVE A KILLER |magazine=[[Time Magazine]] |date=2015-11-23 |url=http://backissues.time.com/storefront/2015/what-it-takes-to-forgive-a-killer/prodTD20151123.html |page=36}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Sites promoting criminal activity&lt;ref name=time20151123/&gt;
* [[Communist]] symbols and imagery in [[Poland]], [[Lithuania]], [[Ukraine]], [[Latvia]], [[Moldova]], and [[Hungary]]
* [[Nazism|Nazi]] and similar websites, particularly in [[Internet censorship in France|France]] and [[Internet censorship in Germany|Germany]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,25197,22885402-12335,00.html |title=Latest Stories From News.Com.Au}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Sites that contain [[Blasphemy|blasphemous]] content, particularly when directed at a majority or state supported religion&lt;ref name=time20151123/&gt;
* Sites that contain [[Defamation|defamatory, slanderous, or libelous]] content&lt;ref name=time20151123/&gt;
* Sites that include [[political satire]]&lt;ref name=time20151123/&gt;
* Sites that contain information on social issues or "online protests, petitions and campaigns"&lt;ref name=time20151123/&gt;

===Security concerns===
Many organizations implement filtering as part of a [[defense in depth (computing)|defense in depth]] strategy to protect their environments from [[malware]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gartner.com/id=747218 |publisher=[[Gartner]] |title=Why Malware Filtering Is Necessary in the Web Gateway |date=26 August 2008 |accessdate=14 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and to protect their reputations in the event of their networks being used, for example, to carry out sexual harassment.

Internet filtering related to threats to [[national security]] that targets the Web sites of [[insurgents]], [[extremists]], and terrorists often enjoys wide public support.&lt;ref name=Faris-2008/&gt;

Examples include:
* [[North Korean websites banned in South Korea|Blocking of pro–North Korean sites by South Korea]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://opennet.net/bulletins/009/ "Collateral Blocking: Filtering by South Korean Government of Pro-North Korean Websites"], OpenNet Initiative: Bulletin 009, 31 January 2005&lt;/ref&gt;
* Blocking sites of groups that foment domestic conflict in [[Internet censorship in India|India]]
* Blocking of sites of the [[Muslim Brotherhood]] in some countries in the Middle East
* Blocking [[WikiLeaks]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://wikileaks.org/wiki/Australia_secretly_censors_Wikileaks_press_release_and_Danish_Internet_censorship_list%2C_16_Mar_2009 |title=Australia secretly censors Wikileaks press release and Danish Internet censorship list |date=16 March 2009 |work=wikileaks.org |accessdate=5 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Blocking sites such as [[4chan]] thought to be related to the group [[Anonymous (group)|Anonymous]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/federal-authorities-take-on-anonymous-hackers/2011/09/11/gIQAYrhgMK_story.html "Federal authorities take on Anonymous hackers"], Associated Press in the Washington Post, 12 September 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

===Protection of existing economic interests and copyright===
The protection of existing economic interests is sometimes the motivation for blocking new Internet services such as low-cost telephone services that use [[Voice over Internet Protocol]] (VoIP). These services can reduce the customer base of telecommunications companies, many of which enjoy entrenched monopoly positions and some of which are government sponsored or controlled.&lt;ref name=Faris-2008/&gt;

[[Anti-copyright]] activists [[Christian Engström]], [[Rick Falkvinge]] and [[Oscar Swartz]] have alleged that censorship of child pornography is being used as a pretext by copyright lobby organizations to get politicians to implement similar site blocking legislation against copyright-related piracy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://torrentfreak.com/the-copyright-lobby-absolutely-loves-child-pornography-110709/ |title=The Copyright Lobby Absolutely Loves Child Pornography |author=[[Rick Falkvinge]] |date=9 July 2011 |work=[[TorrentFreak]] |publisher= |accessdate=26 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Examples include:
* [[File sharing]] and [[peer-to-peer]] (P2P) related websites such as [[The Pirate Bay]]
* [[Skype]]
* Sites that sell or distribute music, but are not 'approved' by rights holders, such as [[allofmp3]]

===Network tools===
Blocking the intermediate tools and applications of the Internet that can be used to assist users in accessing and sharing sensitive material is common in many countries.&lt;ref name=Faris-2008/&gt;

Examples include:
* Media sharing websites (e.g. [[Flickr]] and [[Censorship of YouTube|YouTube]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mashable.com/2007/03/11/youtube-blocked-inthailand/ |title=YouTube Blocked in...Thailand |date=11 March 2007 |work=Mashable |accessdate=5 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Social network service|Social networks]] (e.g. [[Censorship of Facebook|Facebook]] and Instagram)

{{main|Right to be forgotten}}

The ''right to be forgotten'' is a concept that has been discussed and put into practice in the [[European Union]]. In May 2014, the [[European Court of Justice]] ruled against [[Google]] in ''[[Google v González|Costeja]]'', a case brought by a Spanish man who requested the removal of a link to a digitized 1998 article in ''La Vanguardia'' newspaper about an auction for his foreclosed home, for a debt that he had subsequently paid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2014-05/15/google-vs-spain |title=What we can salvage from 'right to be forgotten' ruling |publisher=Wired.co.uk |date=15 May 2014 |accessdate=16 May 2014 |author=Julia Powles |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140516024112/http://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2014-05/15/google-vs-spain |archivedate=16 May 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; He initially attempted to have the article removed by complaining to Spain's data protection agency—''Agencia Española de Protección de Datos''—which rejected the claim on the grounds that it was lawful and accurate, but accepted a complaint against Google and asked Google to remove the results.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Solon |first=Olivia |title=People have the right to be forgotten, rules EU court |url=https://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2014-05/13/right-to-be-forgotten-ruling |work=Wired.co.uk |publisher=Conde Nast Digital |accessdate=13 May 2014 |date=13 May 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140514071400/http://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2014-05/13/right-to-be-forgotten-ruling |archivedate=14 May 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Google sued in Spain and the lawsuit was transferred to the European Court of Justice. The court ruled in ''Costeja'' that search engines are responsible for the content they point to and thus, Google was required to comply with EU [[information privacy|data privacy]] laws.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=EU court backs 'right to be forgotten' in Google case |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-27388289 |publisher=BBC News |accessdate=13 May 2014 |date=13 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=EU court rules Google must tweak search results in test of "right to be forgotten" |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/eu-court-google-must-tweak-search-results-right-to-be-forgotten/ |publisher=CBS News |accessdate=13 May 2014 |date=13 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It began compliance on 30 May 2014 during which it received 12,000 requests to have personal details removed from its search engine.&lt;ref name="GoogleEU"&gt;{{cite news |title=Removal of Google personal information could become work intensive |url=http://www.europenews.net/index.php/sid/222490797/scat/88176adfdf246af5/ht/Removal-of-Google-personal-information-could-become-work-intensive |accessdate=2 June 2014 |publisher=Europe News.Net}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Index on Censorship]] claimed that "''[[Google v González|Costeja]]'' ruling ... allows individuals to complain to search engines about information they do not like with no legal oversight. This is akin to marching into a library and forcing it to pulp books. Although the ruling is intended for private individuals it opens the door to anyone who wants to whitewash their personal history....The Court’s decision is a retrograde move that misunderstands the role and responsibility of search engines and the wider internet. It should send chills down the spine of everyone in the European Union who believes in the crucial importance of free expression and freedom of information."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.indexoncensorship.org/2014/05/index-blasts-eu-court-ruling-right-forgotten/ |title=Index blasts EU court ruling on "right to be forgotten" |work=indexoncensorship.org |accessdate=5 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As more people in more places begin using the Internet for important activities, there is an increase in online censorship, using increasingly sophisticated techniques. The motives, scope, and effectiveness of Internet censorship vary widely from country to country. The countries engaged in state-mandated filtering are clustered in three main regions of the world: east Asia, central Asia, and the [[MENA|Middle East/North Africa]].

Countries in other regions also practice certain forms of filtering. In the [[Internet censorship in the United States|United States]] state-mandated Internet filtering occurs on some computers in libraries and [[K-12 schools]]. Content related to [[Nazism]] or [[Holocaust denial]] is blocked in [[Internet censorship in France|France]] and [[Internet censorship in Germany|Germany]]. [[Child pornography]] and [[hate speech]] are blocked in many countries throughout the world.&lt;ref name=Zittrain-2008&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mitpress.mit.edu/books/chapters/0262541963intro1.pdf |title="Introduction" |accessdate=2011-09-14 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120629074247/http://mitpress.mit.edu/books/chapters/0262541963intro1.pdf |archivedate=29 June 2012 |df=dmy-all }}, Jonathan Zittrain and John Palfrey, in [http://mitpress.mit.edu/catalog/item/default.asp?ttype=2&amp;tid=11329 ''Access Denied: The Practice and Policy of Global Internet Filtering''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090226100258/http://mitpress.mit.edu/catalog/item/default.asp?ttype=2&amp;tid=11329 |date=26 February 2009 }}, Ronald Deibert, John Palfrey, Rafal Rohozinski, and Jonathan Zittrain, eds., MIT Press (Cambridge), 2008&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, many countries throughout the world, including some democracies with long traditions of strong support for [[freedom of expression]] and [[freedom of the press]], are engaged in some amount of online censorship, often with substantial public support.&lt;ref&gt;[http://opennet.net/sites/opennet.net/files/Deibert_03_Ch02_029-056.pdf "Internet Filtering: The Politics and Mechanisms of Control"], Jonathan Zittrain and John Palfrey, in [http://mitpress.mit.edu/catalog/item/default.asp?ttype=2&amp;tid=11329 ''Access Denied: The Practice and Policy of Global Internet Filtering''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090226100258/http://mitpress.mit.edu/catalog/item/default.asp?ttype=2&amp;tid=11329 |date=26 February 2009 }}, Ronald Deibert, John Palfrey, Rafal Rohozinski, and Jonathan Zittrain, eds., MIT Press (Cambridge), 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

Internet censorship in [[China]] is among the most stringent in the world. The government blocks Web sites that discuss the [[Dalai Lama]], the 1989 crackdown on [[Tiananmen Square protests of 1989|Tiananmen Square protesters]], the banned spiritual practice [[Falun Gong]], as well as many general Internet sites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Internet Censorship in China|url=http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/international/countriesandterritories/china/internet_censorship/index.html|accessdate=9 March 2013|newspaper=The New York Times|date=December 28, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The government requires Internet search firms and state media to censor issues deemed officially “sensitive,” and blocks access to foreign websites including [[Facebook]], [[Twitter]], and [[YouTube]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Human Rights Watch|title=World Report 2012: China|url=https://www.hrw.org/world-report-2012/world-report-2012-china|accessdate=9 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  According to a recent study,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|authors=G. King|title=Reverse-engineering censorship in China: Randomized experimentation and participant observation|journal=Science|doi= 10.1126/science.1251722 |date=22 August 2014|volume= 345 |issue= 6199 |page=891|url=http://www.sciencemag.org/content/345/6199/1251722|display-authors=etal |pmid=25146296}}&lt;/ref&gt; censorship in China is used to muzzle those outside government who attempt to spur the creation of crowds for any reason—in opposition to, in support of, or unrelated to the government. The government allows the Chinese people to say whatever they like about the state, its leaders, or their policies, because talk about any subject unconnected to collective action is not censored. The value that Chinese leaders find in allowing and then measuring criticism by hundreds of millions of Chinese people creates actionable information for them and, as a result, also for academic scholars and public policy analysts.

There are international bodies that oppose internet censorship, for example "Internet censorship is open to challenge at the World Trade Organization (WTO) as it can restrict trade in online services, a forthcoming study argues".&lt;ref&gt;[http://search.proquest.com/docview/217137198 WTO could challenge Internet censorship Anonymous.

Detailed country by country information on Internet censorship is provided by the [[OpenNet Initiative]], [[Reporters Without Borders]], [[Freedom House]], and in the [[U.S. State Department]] [[Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor]]'s ''Human Rights Reports''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/hrrpt/2010/index.htm "2010 Country Reports on Human Rights Practices"], Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor, U.S. Department of State, 8 April 2011&lt;/ref&gt; The ratings produced by several of these organizations are summarized in the [[Internet censorship by country]] and the [[Censorship by country]] articles.

====OpenNet Initiative reports====
Through 2010 the OpenNet Initiative had documented Internet filtering by governments in over forty countries worldwide.&lt;ref name=Noman-2011/&gt; The level of filtering in 26 countries in 2007 and in 25 countries in 2009 was classified in the political, social, and security areas. Of the 41 separate countries classified, seven were found to show no evidence of filtering in all three areas ([[Internet censorship in Egypt|Egypt]], [[Internet censorship in France|France]], [[Internet censorship in Germany|Germany]], [[Internet censorship in India|India]], [[Human rights in Ukraine#Media Freedom and Freedom of Information|Ukraine]], [[Internet censorship in the United Kingdom|United Kingdom]], and [[Internet censorship in the United States|United States]]), while one was found to engage in pervasive filtering in all three areas ([[Internet censorship in the People's Republic of China|China]]), 13 were found to engage in pervasive filtering in one or more areas, and 34 were found to engage in some level of filtering in one or more areas. Of the 10 countries classified in both 2007 and 2009, one reduced its level of filtering ([[Internet censorship in Pakistan|Pakistan]]), five increased their level of filtering ([[Internet censorship in Azerbaijan|Azerbaijan]], [[Internet censorship in Belarus|Belarus]], [[Internet censorship in Kazakhstan|Kazakhstan]], [[Internet censorship in South Korea|South Korea]], and [[Internet censorship in Uzbekistan|Uzbekistan]]), and four maintained the same level of filtering ([[Internet censorship in the People's Republic of China|China]], [[Internet censorship in Iran|Iran]], [[Internet censorship in Myanmar|Myanmar]], and [[Human rights in Tajikistan|Tajikistan]]).&lt;ref name=UNESCO-2011/&gt;&lt;ref name=ONIChildPornLegal&gt;Due to legal concerns the [[OpenNet Initiative]] does not check for filtering of [[child pornography]] and because their classifications focus on technical filtering, they do not include other types of censorship.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Freedom on the Net reports====

The ''Freedom on the Net'' reports from [[Freedom House]] provide analytical reports and numerical ratings regarding the state of [[Digital rights|Internet freedom]] for countries worldwide.&lt;ref name=FOTN-2018/&gt; The countries surveyed represent a sample with a broad range of geographical diversity and levels of economic development, as well as varying levels of political and media freedom. The surveys ask a set of questions designed to measure each country's level of Internet and digital media freedom, as well as the access and openness of other digital means of transmitting information, particularly mobile phones and text messaging services. Results are presented for three areas: Obstacles to Access, Limits on Content, and Violations of User Rights.
The results from the three areas are combined into a total score for a country (from 0 for best to 100 for worst) and countries are rated as "Free" (0 to 30), "Partly Free" (31 to 60), or "Not Free" (61 to 100) based on the totals.

Starting in 2009 Freedom House has produced nine editions of the report.&lt;ref name=FOTN-2009&gt;[https://freedomhouse.org/sites/default/files/Freedom%20OnThe%20Net_Full%20Report.pdf ''Freedom on the Net 2009''], Freedom House, accessed 16 April 2012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=FOTN-2011&gt;[http://www.freedomhouse.org/report/freedom-net/freedom-net-2011 ''Freedom on the Net 2011''], Freedom House, accessed 15 April 2012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=FOTN-2012&gt;[http://www.freedomhouse.org/sites/default/files/inline_images/FOTN%202012%20FINAL.pdf ''Freedom on the Net 2012''], Freedom House, accessed 24 September 2012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=FOTN-2013&gt;[http://freedomhouse.org/sites/default/files/resources/FOTN%202013_Full%20Report_0.pdf ''Freedom on the Net 2013''], Freedom House, 3 October 2013.

The 2014 report assessed 65 countries and reported that 36 countries experienced a negative trajectory in Internet freedom since the previous year, with the most significant declines in [[Internet censorship in Russia|Russia]], [[Censorship in Turkey#Internet censorship|Turkey]] and [[Internet in Ukraine#Internet censorship and surveillance|Ukraine]]. According to the report, few countries demonstrated any gains in Internet freedom, and the improvements that were recorded reflected less vigorous application of existing controls rather than new steps taken by governments to actively increase Internet freedom. The year's largest improvement was recorded in [[Internet censorship in India|India]], where restrictions to content and access were relaxed from what had been imposed in 2013 to stifle rioting in the northeastern states. Notable improvement was also recorded in [[Censorship in Brazil#Internet freedom|Brazil]], where lawmakers approved the bill [[Brazilian Civil Rights Framework for the Internet|Marco Civil da Internet]], which contains significant provisions governing net neutrality and safeguarding privacy protection.&lt;ref name=FOTN-2014/&gt;

=====RWB ''Special report on Internet Surveillance''=====
On 12 March 2013, [[Reporters_Without_Borders|Reporters Without Borders]] published a ''Special report on Internet Surveillance''.&lt;ref name=RSFSRS-March2013&gt;[http://surveillance.rsf.org/en/ ''The Enemies of the Internet Special Edition : Surveillance''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130831072750/http://surveillance.rsf.org/en/ |date=31 August 2013 }}, Reporters Without Borders, 12 March 2013&lt;/ref&gt; The report includes two new lists: 
* a list of "State Enemies of the Internet", countries whose governments are involved in active, intrusive surveillance of news providers, resulting in grave violations of freedom of information and human rights; and
* a list of "Corporate Enemies of the Internet", companies that sell products that are liable to be used by governments to violate human rights and freedom of information.

The five "State Enemies of the Internet" named in March 2013 are: [[Bahrain]], [[China]], [[Iran]], [[Syria]], and [[Vietnam]].&lt;ref name=RSFSRS-March2013/&gt;

The five "Corporate Enemies of the Internet" named in March 2013 are: [[Amesys]] (France), [[Blue Coat Systems]] (U.S.), [[Gamma International]] (UK and Germany), [[Hacking Team]] (Italy), and Trovicor (Germany).&lt;ref name=RSFSRS-March2013/&gt;

====BBC World Service global public opinion poll====
A poll of 27,973 adults in 26 countries, including 14,306 Internet users,&lt;ref&gt;For the BBC poll Internet users are those who used the Internet within the previous six months.&lt;/ref&gt; was conducted for the [[BBC World Service]] by the international polling firm [[GlobeScan]] using telephone and in-person interviews between 30 November 2009 and 7 February 2010. GlobeScan Chairman Doug Miller felt, overall, that the poll showed that:
:Despite worries about privacy and fraud, people around the world see access to the internet as their fundamental right. They think the web is a force for good, and most don’t want governments to regulate it.&lt;ref name=BBCPoll-2010&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/shared/bsp/hi/pdfs/08_03_10_BBC_internet_poll.pdf "BBC Internet Poll: Detailed Findings"], BBC World Service, 8 March 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

Findings from the poll include:&lt;ref name=BBCPoll-2010/&gt;
*Nearly four in five (78%) Internet users felt that the Internet had brought them greater freedom.
*Most Internet users (53%) felt that "the internet should never be regulated by any level of government anywhere".
*Opinion was evenly split between Internet users who felt that “the internet is a safe place to express my opinions” (48%) and those who disagreed (49%). Somewhat surprisingly users in [[Internet censorship in Germany|Germany]] and [[Internet censorship in France|France]] agreed the least, followed by users in a highly filtered country such as [[Internet Censorship in China|China]], while users in [[Internet censorship in Egypt|Egypt]], [[Internet censorship in India|India]] and [[Internet in Kenya|Kenya]] agreed more strongly.&lt;ref name=UNESCO-2011/&gt;
*The aspects of the Internet that cause the most concern include: fraud (32%), violent and explicit content (27%), threats to [[internet privacy|privacy]] (20%), state censorship of content (6%), and the extent of corporate presence (3%).
*Almost four in five Internet users and non-users around the world felt that access to the Internet was a fundamental right (50% strongly agreed, 29% somewhat agreed, 9% somewhat disagreed, 6% strongly disagreed, and 6% gave no opinion).&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/8548190.stm "Internet access is 'a fundamental right'"], ''BBC News'', 8 March 2010&lt;/ref&gt; And while there is strong support for this right in all of the countries surveyed, it is surprising that the United States and Canada were among the top five countries where people most strongly disagreed that access to the Internet was a fundamental right of all people (13% in [[Human rights in Japan#Civil liberties|Japan]], 11% in the [[Internet censorship in the United States|U.S.]], 11% in [[Internet in Kenya|Kenya]], 11% in [[Internet censorship in Pakistan|Pakistan]], and 10% in [[Internet censorship in Canada|Canada]] strongly disagree).&lt;ref name=UNESCO-2011/&gt;

====Internet Society's Global Internet User Survey====
In July and August 2012 the [[Internet Society]] conducted online interviews of more than 10,000 Internet users in 20 countries. Some of the results relevant to Internet censorship are summarized below.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.internetsociety.org/sites/default/files/GIUS2012-GlobalData-Table-20121120_0.pdf "Global Internet User Survey 2012"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130314063616/https://www.internetsociety.org/sites/default/files/GIUS2012-GlobalData-Table-20121120_0.pdf |date=14 March 2013 }}, Internet Society, 20 November 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

===Transparency of filtering or blocking activities===
Among the countries that filter or block online content, few openly admit to or fully disclose their filtering and blocking activities. States are frequently opaque and/or deceptive about the blocking of access to political information.&lt;ref name=Chadwick-2009/&gt; For example:
* [[Internet censorship in Saudi Arabia|Saudi Arabia]] and the [[Internet in the United Arab Emirates|United Arab Emirates]] (UAE) are among the few states that publish detailed information about their filtering practices and display a notification to the user when attempting to access a blocked website. The websites that are blocked are mostly [[Pornographic]] and against the respective states and/or the Islamic Religion.
* In contrast, countries such as [[Internet censorship in China|China]] and [[Internet censorship in Tunisia|Tunisia]] send users a false error indication. China blocks requests by users for a banned website at the [[Transport layer|router level]] and a connection error is returned, effectively preventing the user's [[IP address]] from making further [[HTTP]] requests for a varying time, which appears to the user as "time-out" error with no explanation. Tunisia has altered the block page functionality of [[SmartFilter]], the commercial filtering software it uses, so that users attempting to access blocked websites receive a fake "File not found" error page.
* In [[Internet censorship in Uzbekistan|Uzbekistan]] users are frequently sent block pages stating that the website is blocked because of pornography, even when the page contains no pornography. Uzbeki ISPs may also redirect users' request for blocked websites to unrelated websites, or sites similar to the banned websites, but with different information.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = ed.

===Arab Spring===
:''See also: [[Internet Censorship in the Arab Spring]], [[Internet in Egypt#2011 Internet shutdown|2011 Egyptian Internet shutdown]], and [[Free speech in the media during the Libyan civil war]]''

During the [[Arab Spring]] of 2011, media [[jihad]] (media struggle) was extensive. Internet and mobile technologies, particularly social networks such as Facebook and Twitter, played and are playing important new and unique roles in organizing and spreading the protests and making them visible to the rest of the world. An activist in Egypt tweeted, “we use Facebook to schedule the protests, Twitter to coordinate, and YouTube to tell the world”.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.miller-mccune.com/politics/the-cascading-effects-of-the-arab-spring-28575/ "The Arab Spring’s Cascading Effects"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110227051329/http://www.miller-mccune.com/politics/the-cascading-effects-of-the-arab-spring-28575/ |date=27 February 2011 }}, Philip N. Howard, Miller-McCune, 23 February 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

This successful use of digital media in turn led to increased censorship including the complete loss of Internet access for periods of time in Egypt&lt;ref name="jamescowie_techdetails_Egyptfullblock"/&gt;&lt;ref name="IDGnews_Egyptfullblock"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://monkey.org/~labovit/blog//viewpage.php?page=middle_east_scorecard_feb20 "Middle East Political Protest And Internet Traffic Report: February 12–20, 2011"], Craig Labovitz, Arbor Networks&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Free speech in the media during the 2011 Libyan civil war|Libya]] in 2011.&lt;ref name=Libya-RWB-2011/&gt;&lt;ref name="Analysis of Egyptian and Libyan outages"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.caida.org/publications/papers/2011/outages_censorship/outages_censorship.pdf| title=Analysis of Country-wide Internet Outages Caused by Censorship|last=Dainotti|year=2011| publisher=ACM|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Syria, the Syrian Electronic Army (SEA), an organization that operates with at least tacit support of the government, claims responsibility for defacing or otherwise compromising scores of websites that it contends spread news hostile to the Syrian government. SEA disseminates denial of service (DoS) software designed to target media websites including those of [[Al Jazeera]], [[BBC News]], Syrian satellite broadcaster [[Orient TV]], and Dubai-based [[Al Arabiya]] TV.&lt;ref&gt;[http://opennet.net/syrian-electronic-army-disruptive-attacks-and-hyped-targets "Syrian Electronic Army: Disruptive Attacks and Hyped Targets"], OpenNet Initiative, 25 June 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

In response to the greater freedom of expression brought about by the Arab Spring revolutions in countries that were previously subject to very strict censorship, in March 2011, Reporters Without Borders moved [[Internet censorship in Tunisia|Tunisia]] and [[Internet censorship in Egypt|Egypt]] from its "Internet enemies" list to its list of countries "under surveillance"&lt;ref&gt;[http://en.rsf.org/surveillance-egypt,39740.html "Countries under surveillance: Egypt"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304060153/http://en.rsf.org/surveillance-egypt,39740.html |date=4 March 2016 }}, Reporters Without Borders, March 2011&lt;/ref&gt; and in 2012 dropped [[Free speech in the media during the Libyan civil war|Libya]] from the list entirely.&lt;ref name=RWBEnemies2012/&gt;&lt;!-- defined by template:RWB Internet lists --&gt; At the same time, there were warnings that Internet censorship might increase in other countries following the events of the Arab Spring.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.future500.org/blog/censorship-fallout-from-the-arab-spring/ "Censorship fallout from the Arab Spring?"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120126060054/http://www.future500.org/blog/censorship-fallout-from-the-arab-spring/ |date=26 January 2012 }}, Juliette Terzieff, The Future 500, 29 June 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://ca.reuters.com/article/technologyNews/idCATRE78R3CM20110928?pageNumber=1&amp;virtualBrandChannel=0 "Insight: Social media – a political tool for good or evil?"], Peter Apps, Reuters Canada, 28 September 2011&lt;/ref&gt; However, in 2013, Libyan communication company [[Libya Telecom &amp; Technology|LTT]] blocked the pornographic websites.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.libya-businessnews.com/2013/09/13/ltt-blocks-pornographic-websites/ LTT Blocks Pornographic Websites]&lt;/ref&gt; It even blocked the family-filtered videos of ordinary websites like [[Dailymotion]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2017}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15683">'''Intuition''' in the context of '''decision-making''' is defined as a “non-sequential information-processing mode.”&lt;ref name="Sinclair2005"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sinclair|first1=M.|title=Intuition: Myth or a Decision-making Tool?|journal=Management Learning|volume=36|issue=3|year=2005|pages=353–370|issn=1350-5076|doi=10.1177/1350507605055351}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is distinct from insight (a much more protracted process) and can be contrasted with the deliberative style of decision-making. Intuition can influence judgment through either [[emotion]] or [[cognition]], and there has been some suggestion that it may be a means of bridging the two.&lt;ref name="Sinclair2005"/&gt; Individuals use intuition and more deliberative decision-making styles interchangeably, but there has been some evidence that people tend to gravitate to one or the other style more naturally.&lt;ref name="de VriesHolland2008"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=de Vries|first1=Marieke|last2=Holland|first2=Rob W.|last3=Witteman|first3=Cilia L.

Snap judgments made possible by [[heuristic]]s are sometimes identified as intuition.

==Definition and related terms==
Intuitive decision-making can be described as the process by which information acquired through associated learning and stored in long-term memory is accessed unconsciously to form the basis of a judgment or decision.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last = Betsch |first= Cornelia|title = Intuition in judgment and decision making|publisher = Lawrence Erlbaum Associates|location = New York|year = 2008|isbn = 0805857419}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This information can be transferred through affect induced by exposure to available options, or through unconscious cognition. Intuition is based on the implicit knowledge available to the decision-maker. For example, owning a dog as a child imbues someone with implicit knowledge about canine behavior, which may then be channeled into a decision-making process as the emotion of fear or anxiety before taking a certain kind of action around an angry dog. Intuition is the mechanism by which this implicit knowledge is brought to the forefront of the decision-making process. Some definitions of intuition in the context of decision-making point to the importance of recognizing cues and patterns in one’s environment and then using them to improve one’s problem solving.&lt;ref name="HodgkinsonLangan-Fox2008"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hodgkinson|first1=Gerard P.|last2=Langan-Fox|first2=Janice|last3=Sadler-Smith|first3=Eugene|title=Intuition: A fundamental bridging construct in the behavioural sciences|journal=British Journal of Psychology|volume=99|issue=1|year=2008|pages=1–27|issn=0007-1269|doi=10.1348/000712607X216666}}&lt;/ref&gt; Intuition in decision-making has been connected two assumptions: 1) Tacit decision - previous decisions are affecting and 2) Explicit decision - emotions are affecting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Zander |first1=Thea |last2=Horr |first2=Ninja K. |last3=Bolte |first3=Annette |last4=Volz |first4=Kirsten G. |title=Intuitive decision making as a gradual process: investigating semantic intuition-based and priming-based decisions with fMRI |journal=Brain and Behavior |date=January 2016 |volume=6 |issue=1 |doi=10.1002/brb3.420 |url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/brb3.420 |language=en |issn=2162-3279}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Intuition's effect on decision-making is distinct from insight, which requires time to mature. A month spent pondering a math problem may lead to a gradual understanding of the answer, even if one does not know where that understanding came from. Intuition, in contrast, is a more instantaneous, immediate understanding upon first being confronted with the math problem. Intuition is also distinct from [[tacit knowledge|implicit knowledge]] and learning, which inform intuition but are separate concepts. Intuition is the mechanism by which implicit knowledge is made available during an instance of decision-making.

==Channels of intuitive influence==

===Heuristics===
Traditional research often points to the role of heuristics in helping people make “intuitive” decisions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Kahneman | first = Daniel | title = Judgment under uncertainty : heuristics and biases | publisher = Cambridge University Press | location = Cambridge New York | year = 1982 | isbn = 0521284147 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Those following the heuristics-and-biases school of thought developed by [[Amos Tversky]] and [[Daniel Kahneman]] believe that intuitive judgments are derived from an “informal and unstructured mode of reasoning” that ultimately does not include any methodical calculation.  Tversky and Kahneman identify availability, representativeness, and anchoring/adjustment as three heuristics that influence many intuitive judgments made under uncertain conditions.

The heuristics-and-biases approach looks at patterns of biased judgments to distinguish heuristics from normative reasoning processes. Early studies supporting this approach associated each heuristic with a set of [[cognitive bias|biases]]. These biases were “departures from the normative rational theory” and helped identify the underlying heuristics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Gilovich | first = Thomas | title = Heuristics and biases : the psychology of intuitive judgement | publisher = Cambridge University Press | location = Cambridge, U.K. New York | year = 2002 | isbn = 0521792606 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Use of the availability heuristic, for example, leads to error whenever the memory retrieved is a biased recollection of actual frequency. This can be attributed to an individual’s tendency to remember dramatic cases. Heuristic processes are quick intuitive responses to basic questions such as frequency.

===Affect===
Some researchers point to intuition as a purely affective phenomenon that demonstrates the ability of emotions to influence decision-making without cognitive mediation. This supports the dual processing theory of affect and cognition, under which conscious thought is not required for emotions to be experienced, but nevertheless positive conscious thoughts towards person's will have positive emotional affects on them.  In studies comparing affect and cognition, some researchers have found that positive mood is associated with reliance on affective signals while negative mood is associated with more deliberative thought processes.&lt;ref name="de VriesHolland2008"/&gt; [[mood (psychology)|Mood]] is thus considered a moderator in the strategic decisions people carry out. In a series of three studies, the authors confirmed that people in a positive mood faced with a card-based gambling task utilized intuition to perform better at higher-risk stages than people who were in a negative mood.  Other theories propose that intuition has both cognitive and affective elements, bridging the gap between these two fundamentally different kinds of human information processing.&lt;ref name="Sinclair2005"/&gt;

==Comparison to other decision-making styles==
Intuitive decision-making can be contrasted with deliberative decision-making, which is based on cognitive factors like beliefs, arguments, and reasons, commonly referred to as one's explicit knowledge.&lt;ref name="DienesPerner1999"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dienes|first1=Zoltan|last2=Perner|first2=Josef|title=A theory of implicit and explicit knowledge|journal=Behavioral and Brain Sciences|volume=22|issue=05|year=1999|issn=0140-525X|doi=10.1017/S0140525X99002186}}&lt;/ref&gt; Intuitive decision-making is based on implicit knowledge relayed to the conscious mind at the point of decision through affect or unconscious cognition. Some studies also suggest that intuitive decision-making relies more on the mind's parallel processing functions, while deliberative decision-making relies more on sequential processing.

==Prevalence of intuitive judgment and measurement of use==
Although people use intuitive and deliberative decision-making modes interchangeably, individuals value the decisions they make more when they are allowed to make them using their preferred style.&lt;ref name="de VriesHolland2008"/&gt;  This specific kind of [[regulatory focus theory|regulatory fit]] is referred to as decisional fit. The emotions people experience after a decision is made tend to be more pleasant when the preferred style is used, regardless of the decision outcome. Some studies suggest that the mood with which the subject enters the decision-making process can also affect the style they choose to employ: sad people tend to be more deliberative, while people in a happy mood rely more on intuition.&lt;ref name="de VriesHolland2008"/&gt;

The Preference for Intuition and Deliberation Scale developed by Coralie Bestch in 2004 measures propensity toward intuitiveness. The scale defines preference for intuition as tendency to use affect (“gut-feel”) as a basis for decision-making instead of cognition. The [[Myers-Briggs Type Indicator]] is also sometimes used.

==Intuitive decision-making in specific environments==

===Management and decision-making===
Researchers have also explored the efficacy of intuitive judgments and the debate on the function of intuition versus analysis in decisions that require specific expertise, as in management of organizations. In this context, intuition is interpreted as an “unconscious expertise” rather than a traditionally purely heuristic response. Research suggests that this kind of intuition is based on a “broad constellation of past experiences, knowledge, skills, perceptions and feelings.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Hodgkinson | first = Gerard | title = The Oxford handbook of organizational decision making | publisher = Oxford University Press | location = Oxford New York | year = 2008 | isbn = 9780199290468 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The efficacy of intuitive decision-making in the management environment is largely dependent on the decision context and decision maker’s expertise. 

The expertise-based intuition increases over time when the employee gets more experience regarding the organization worked for and by gathering domain-specific knowledge. In this context the so-called intuition is not just series of random guesses, but rather a process of combining expertise and know-how with the employee’s instincts. &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Intuitions can, however be difficult to prove to be right in terms of decision-making. It is in most situations likely, that decisions based on intuition are harder to justify than those that are based in rational analysis. Especially in the context of business and organizational decision-making, one should be able to justify their decisions, thus making them purely intuitively is often not possible. &lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hensman|first=Ann|last2=Sadler-Smith|first2=Eugene|date=2011|title=Intuitive decision making in banking and ﬁnance|url=|journal=European Management Journal|volume=29|pages=51-66|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is debated upon whether intuition is accurate, but evidence has been shown that under aforementioned conditions it can. When it comes to the decision maker him/herself, mainly two factors affect the effectiveness of intuitive decision-making. These factors have been found to be the amount of expertise the person has and the individuals processing style.  &lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Salas|first=Eduardo|last2=Rosen|first2=Michael A.|last3=DiazGranados|first3=Deborah|date=2010|title=Expertise-Based Intuition and Decision  Making in Organizations|url=|journal=Journal of Management|volume=36|pages=941-973|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

===Finance===
A study of traders from the four largest investment banks in London looked at the role that emotion and expert intuition play in financial trading decisions. This study reported on the differences between how higher and lower performing traders incorporate intuition in their decision strategy, and attributed the success of some higher performing traders to their great disposition to reflect critically about their intuitions. This propensity to think critically about intuition and the source of those hunches served as a distinguishing factor between the higher and lower performing traders included in the study. While successful traders were more open to this critical introspection, lower performing traders were reported to rely on their feelings alone rather than further explore the affective influences for their decisions. Reflection on the origin of feelings by expert traders may be particularly salient given affect-as-information model, which holds that the impact of emotions on behavior is reduced or even disappears when the relevance of those emotions is explicitly called into question.&lt;ref name="Fenton-O'CreevySoane2011"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Fenton-O'Creevy|first1=Mark|last2=Soane|first2=Emma|last3=Nicholson|first3=Nigel|last4=Willman|first4=Paul|title=Thinking, feeling and deciding: The influence of emotions on the decision making and performance of traders|journal=Journal of Organizational Behavior|volume=32|issue=8|year=2011|pages=1044–1061|issn=0894-3796|doi=10.1002/job.720}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been noted in a research, that intuition is used as a method of decision-making in the banking industry. Record shows that intuition is used in combination with pre-existing solution models and previous experiences. Participants of the research also reported to analyse their intuitive decisions afterwards and possibly altering them. &lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

===High-risk situations===
Traditional literature attributes the role of judgment processes in risk perception and decision-making to cognition rather than emotion. However, more recent studies suggest a link between emotion and cognition as it relates to decision-making in high-risk environments. Studies of decision-making in high-risk environments suggest that individuals who self-identify as intuitive decision-makers tend to make faster decisions that imply greater deviation from risk neutrality than those who prefer the deliberative style.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = LastName | first = FirstName | title = Intuition in judgment and decision making | publisher = Lawrence Erlbaum Associates | location = New York | year = 2008 | isbn = 0805857419 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, risk-averse intuitive decision-makers will choose to not participate in a dangerous event more quickly than deliberative decision-makers, but will choose not to participate in more instances than their deliberative counterparts.

=== Strategic decisions ===
Strategic decisions are usually made by the top management in the organizations. Usually strategic decisions also effect on the future of the organization. Rationality has been the guideline and also justified way to make decisions because they are based on facts. Intuition in strategic decision making is less examined and for example can be depending on a case be described as managers know-how, expertise or just a gut feeling, hunch.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Elbanna|first=Said|date=6 April 2006|title=Strategic decision-making: Process perspectives|url=https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1468-2370.2006.00118.x|journal=International Journal of Management Reviews|language=en|volume=8|issue=1|pages=1–20|doi=10.1111/j.1468-2370.2006.00118.x|issn=1460-8545|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[United States copyright law]] and [[jurisprudence]] established under the doctrine of ''[[stare decisis]]'' by the case of ''Netbula, LLC v. Symantec Corp.'', 516 F. Supp.2d 1137 ([[United States District Court for the Ninth District of California|N.D.Cal.]] 2007)&lt;ref&gt;Netbula, LLC v. Symantec Corp., 516 F. Supp.2d 1137 (N.D.Cal. 2007)&lt;/ref&gt; and related cases.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.decoderpro.com/k/docket/218.pdf] Netbula, LLC v. Storage Technology Corporation et al., 2008 U.S. Dist LEXIS 4119 (N.D. Cal., January 18, 2008)&lt;/ref&gt; The cases defined the boundaries of [[property rights]] and contractual rights in the licensing of [[digital works]].  It is so called because the cases were decided by two renowned American judges and leading jurists, former U.S. District Judge [[Martin Jenkins]] (now a [[Justice]] in [[California Courts of Appeal]]) and Magistrate Judge Elizabeth D. Laporte.

The basic principles of the doctrine can be summarized:

(1) If an accused infringer did not see or agree to copy restriction, there was no infringement;

(2) A "one user on one computer" restriction does not limit the scope of a software license, it's an independent contractual covenant;

(3) A termination clause in the license agreement does not limit the scope of the license, it's an independent contractual covenant.

The ingenious observation Justice Jenkins made was that in a copyright action, although license is an affirmative defense to infringement, the "plaintiff’s initial hurdle is proving the terms of the license." 516 F. Supp. 2d at 1151. The Jenkins–Laporte doctrine provides a legal foundation for circumvention of the exclusive rights provided by the Copyright Act, as the doctrine requires the copyright owner to prove the negative.

The '''Jewish exodus from Arab and Muslim countries''', or '''Jewish exodus from Arab countries''', was the departure, flight, expulsion, evacuation and migration of 850,000 Jews,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mfa.gov.il/MFA/VideoLibrary/Pages/Jewish-refugees-from-Arab-lands.aspx|title=VI- November 30: Commemorating the expulsion of Jews from Arab lands|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Group seeks justice for 'forgotten' Jews |first=Warren |last=Hoge |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/11/04/world/americas/04iht-nations.4.8182206.html |newspaper=The New York Times |date=5 November 2007 |accessdate=3 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; primarily of [[Sephardi Jews|Sephardi]] and [[Mizrahi Jews|Mizrahi]] background, from [[Arab countries|Arab]] and [[Muslim countries]], mainly from 1948 to the early 1970s. The last major [[Exodus of Iran's Jews|migration wave]] took place from Iran in 1979–80, as a consequence of the Islamic Revolution.

A number of small-scale Jewish exoduses began in many Middle Eastern countries early in the 20th century with the only substantial [[aliyah]] coming from Yemen and Syria.&lt;ref&gt;Reeva S. Simon, Michael M. Laskier, Sara Reguer, [https://books.google.com/books?id=bW7aNxCGDKQC&amp;pg=PA327&amp;lpg=PA327#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false The Jews of the Middle East and North Africa in Modern Times], 2003, p. 327="Before the 1940s only two communities, Yemen and Syria, made substantial aliyah."&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to the [[Israeli Declaration of Independence|creation of Israel]] in 1948, approximately 800,000 Jews were living in lands that now make up the [[Arab world]]. Of these, just under two-thirds lived in the French and Italian-controlled [[North Africa]], 15–20% in the [[Kingdom of Iraq]], approximately 10% in the [[Kingdom of Egypt]] and approximately 7% in the [[Kingdom of Yemen]]. A further 200,000 lived in [[Pahlavi Iran]] and the [[Republic of Turkey]].

The first large-scale exoduses took place in the late 1940s and early 1950s, primarily from Iraq, Yemen and Libya. In these cases over 90% of the Jewish population left, despite the necessity of leaving their property behind.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Aharoni |first=Ada |url=http://taylorandfrancis.metapress.com/content/w91udxrhc7cf5a86 |title=The Forced Migration of Jews from Arab Countries |journal=Peace Review: A Journal of Social Justice |publisher=Routledge |year=2003 |volume=15 |pages=53–60 |ref=harv |issue=1 |doi=10.1080/1040265032000059742 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Two hundred and sixty thousand Jews from Arab countries immigrated to [[Israel]] between 1948 and 1951, accounting for 56% of the total immigration to the newly founded state.&lt;ref name=colin63/&gt; Following the establishment of the State of Israel, a plan to accommodate 600,000 immigrants over four years, doubling the existing Jewish population, was submitted by the Israeli government to the Knesset.&lt;ref name=hokohen&gt;{{cite book |last=Hakohen |first=Devorah |title=Immigrants in Turmoil: Mass Immigration to Israel and Its Repercussions in the 1950s and After |publisher=Syracuse University Press |year=2003 |page=46 |isbn=9780815629696|quote=After independence, the government presented the Knesset with a plan to double the Jewish population within four years. This meant bringing in 600,000 immigrants in a four-year period. or 150,000 per year. Absorbing 150,000 newcomers annually under the trying conditions facing the new state was a heavy burden indeed. Opponents in the Jewish Agency and the government of mass immigration argued that there was no justification for organizing large-scale emigration among Jews whose lives were not in danger, particularly when the desire and motivation were not their own.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The plan, however, encountered mixed reactions; there were those within the Jewish Agency and government who opposed promoting a large-scale emigration movement among Jews whose lives were not in danger.&lt;ref name=hokohen/&gt;

Later waves peaked at different times in different regions over the subsequent decades. The peak of the exodus from Egypt occurred in 1956 following the [[Suez Crisis]]. The exodus from the other North African Arab countries peaked in the 1960s. Lebanon was the only Arab country to see a temporary increase in its Jewish population during this period, due to an influx of Jews from other Arab countries, although by the mid-1970s the Jewish community of Lebanon had also dwindled. Six hundred thousand Jews from Arab and Muslim countries had reached Israel by 1972.&lt;ref name="Schwartz"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.adi-schwartz.com/israeli-arab-conflict/all-i-wanted-was-justice/|title=All I Wanted was Justice|last=Schwartz|first=Adi|date=4 January 2008|work=[[Haaretz]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Shulewitz&gt;Malka Hillel Shulewitz, ''The Forgotten Millions: The Modern Jewish Exodus from Arab Lands'', Continuum 2001, pp. 139 and 155.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Aharoni&gt;Ada Aharoni [http://www.hsje.org/forcedmigration.htm "The Forced Migration of Jews from Arab Countries] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120213230126/http://www.hsje.org/forcedmigration.htm |date=13 February 2012 }}, Historical Society of Jews from Egypt website.

==Background==
{{main|History of the Jews under Muslim rule}}
At the time of the [[Muslim conquests]] of the 7th century, ancient Jewish communities had existed in many parts of the Middle East and North Africa since Antiquity. [[History of the Jews under Muslim rule|Jews under Islamic rule]] were given the status of [[dhimmi]], along with certain other pre-Islamic religious groups.&lt;ref&gt;Bat Ye'or (1985), p. 45&lt;/ref&gt; As such, these groups were accorded certain rights as "[[People of the Book]]".

During [[Christian persecution of Jews|waves of persecution in Medieval Europe]], many Jews found refuge in Muslim lands,&lt;ref&gt;Lewis 1984 p. 62&lt;/ref&gt; though in other times and places, Jews fled persecution in Muslim lands and found refuge in Christian lands.&lt;ref&gt;Lewis 1984 p. 106&lt;/ref&gt; [[Alhambra Decree|Jews expelled from the Iberian Peninsula]] were [[History of the Jews in the Ottoman Empire#Influx of Sephardi Jews from Iberia|invited to settle]] in various parts of the [[Ottoman Empire]], where they would often form a prosperous [[model minority]] of [[History of the Jews in the Ottoman Empire#Banking and finance|merchants acting as intermediaries]] for their Muslim rulers.

==North Africa region==

===French colonization===
In the 19th century, [[Francization]] of Jews in the French colonial [[North Africa]], due to the work of organizations such as the [[Alliance Israelite Universelle]]{{sfn|Laskier|1994}} and French policies such as the [[Crémieux Decree|Algerian citizenship decree of 1870]],&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Israeli-Palestinian Conflict in the Francophone World|first=Nathalie|last=Debrauwere-Miller|publisher=Routledge|year=2011|isbn=9781135843878|page=3|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_giRAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA3&amp;lpg=PA3}}&lt;/ref&gt; resulted in a separation of the community from the local Muslims.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Laskier|first=Michael|title=North African Jewry in the Twentieth Century: The Jews of Morocco, Tunisia, and Algeria|publisher=NYU Press|year=1994|isbn=9780814750728}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Shaked, Edith Haddad. "On the State of being (Jewish) between 'Orient' and 'Occident'" in Bat-Ami Bar On and Tessman, Lisa, eds. Jewish Locations: Traversing Racialized Landscapes. (City: Rowman &amp; Littlefield 2002), "Quite many observers have noted that it is remarkable how quickly Tunisian Jews shifted their identification and leapt from a way of life quite similar to that of the Muslim Arab population into a new European cultural world, following the establishment of the French Protectorate in Tunisia in 1882. Under the French Protectorate, the Jews had a different position, "one small notch above the Muslims on the pyramid which is the basis of all colonial societies." ... For the generation born under the protectorate, the French language replaced Judeo-Arabic as the Tunisian Jews' mother tongue.... Under French colonial rule, the Jews of Tunisia deconstructed many aspects of their "Oriental" selves, and experienced an image shift, from resembling the "Oriental" colonized Arabs to resembling the "Occidental" French colonizers, through their rapid adaptation to the French language, customs, and culture. Since the French administrators strongly encouraged the French acculturation of Tunisian Jews through many educational and economic opportunities, their "Oriental" past started just to fade away. As a result, a new society of French-assimilated Jews emerged. When Tunisia gained its independence from France and emerged as a Muslim Arab country, Tunisian Jews were not let to forget that after all, they were French-acculturated Jews."&lt;/ref&gt;

The French began [[Invasion of Algiers in 1830|the conquest of Algeria in 1830]]. The following century had a profound influence on the status of the Algerian Jews; following the 1870 "Décret Crémieux", they were elevated from the protected minority dhimmi status to French citizens of the colonial power.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Chouraqui|first=Andre|authorlink=André Chouraqui|year=2002|title=Between East and West: A History of the Jews of North Africa|isbn=1-59045-118-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Studies in Contemporary Jewry: Volume XIX: Jews and the State: Dangerous Alliances and the Perils of Privilege|last=Mendelsohn|first=Ezra|year=2004|isbn=9780195346879|page=93|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=i-TttDROff0C&amp;pg=PA93#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; The decree began a wave of [[Pied-Noir]]-led anti-Jewish protests (such as the 1897 anti-Jewish riots in [[Oran]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Algeria, 1830–2000: A Short History|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=x_-5XTVKW08C&amp;pg=PA10|year=2004|publisher=Cornell University Press|isbn=0-8014-8916-4|page=10}}&lt;/ref&gt;), which the Muslim community did not participate in, to the disappointment of the European agitators.
{{sfn|Chouraqui|2002|p=152|ps=: "A number of factors finally led to the defeat of the anti-Semitic party in Algeria and to its disappearance in 1902.... Most important perhaps was the refusal of the Moslems of Algeria to allow themselves to be drawn into the anti-Jewish manifestations, thus confounding the hopes and plans of the agitators. This phenomenon is a telling proof that the assertions regarding the so-called axiomatic hatred of the Moslems for the Jews were utterly unfounded."}} Though there were also cases of Muslim-led anti-Jewish riots, such as in [[Constantine, Algeria|Constantine]] in 1934 when 34 Jews were killed.&lt;ref name="Vance2011"&gt;{{cite book|author=Sharon Vance|title=The Martyrdom of a Moroccan Jewish Saint|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5eE0QbtrTAgC|date=10 May 2011|publisher=BRILL|isbn=90-04-20700-7|page=182|quote=Muslim anti Jewish riots in Constantine in 1934 when 34 jews were killed}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Neighbouring [[Husainid Dynasty|Husainid Tunisia]] began to come under European influence in the late 1860s and became [[French protectorate of Tunisia|a French protectorate]] in 1881. Since the 1837 accession of [[Ahmad I ibn Mustafa|Ahmed Bey]],{{sfn|Chouraqui|2002a|ps=: "Although the French Protectorate was established only in 1881, the occupation of Algeria in 1830 exerted a profound influence on Tunisia's rulers and on the life of the Jews there. The accession of Ahmed Bey to the throne in 1837 marked a turning point in the evolution of Tunisia, and during his eighteen-year reign the Jews had a foretaste of the security and freedom that they were to enjoy under the Protectorate."}} and continued by his successor [[Muhammad II ibn al-Husayn|Muhammed Bey]],{{sfn|Chouraqui|2002b|ps=: "Immediately after [Mohammed Bey's 1855] accession, he abolished the corvee duty to which Jews were still subjected under the old laws for the dhimmis, and he made the Jews subject to the same fiscal laws as Moslems."}} Tunisia's Jews were elevated within Tunisia society with improved freedom and security, which was confirmed and safeguarded during the French protectorate.{{sfn|Chouraqui|2002c|ps=: "But for the Jews of Tunisia [the 1881 French Protectorate] did not signify the revolutionary change ... [but] rather, to confirm and safeguard through the French presence the existing liberal tendencies which had characterized the Regency since the reign of Ahmed Bey."}} Around a third of Tunisian Jews took French citizenship during the protectorate.{{sfn|Chouraqui|2002d|ps=: "Altogether, 7,311 Jews were granted French nationality in Tunisia between 1911 and the end of the Protectorate. These, with their descendants, eventually made up one-third of the Jewish population of Tunisia."}}

Morocco, which had remained independent during the 19th century, became [[French protectorate in Morocco|a French protectorate]] in 1912. However, during less than half a century of colonization, the equilibrium between Jews and Muslims in Morocco was upset, and the Jewish community was again positioned between the colonisers and the Muslim majority.{{sfn|Chouraqui|2002e|ps=: "[Moroccan] Jews became a monolithic block poised between Europeans and Moslems, not fully accepted by either group.... The equilibrium in which the Jews and Moslems had lived, for better or worse, for twelve centuries was upset by the introduction into Morocco of the third and henceforth most powerful force—the French.... Morocco's Jews found themselves, at the end of fifty years, alienated from both societies on whose perimeters they lived."}} French penetration into Morocco between 1906 and 1912 created significant Morocco Muslim resentment, resulting in nationwide protests and military unrest. During the period a number of anti-European or anti-French protests extended to include anti-Jewish manifestations, such as in [[Casablanca]], [[Oujda]] and [[Fes]] in 1907-08 and later in the [[1912 Fes riots]].{{sfn|Laskier|2012|p=42|ps=: "But the worst was yet to come, for the systematic French penetration after Algeciras brought Moroccan Muslim resentment to the boiling point. The resentment was manifested in the form of popular protests and tribal and military unrest throughout the country. The French proceeded by occupying Oujda; and following anti-European manifestations in Marrakesh and riots in Casablanca (1907), resulting in the killing of Europeans, the French government sent to Casablanca's coast the cruiser Galilee and a French expeditionary force. French troops were now in Casablanca whereas major portions of the adjacent Chaouia plain were occupied under the command of Generals Drude and d'Amade. ln 1907–1908 anti-European feelings extended to include anti-Jewish manifestations in Oujda, Casablanca, and Fez."}}

The situation in colonial Libya was similar; as for the French in the other North African countries, the [[History of Italian Libya|Italian influence in Libya]] was welcomed by the Jewish community, increasing their separation from the non-Jewish Libyans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eUM2phcxIFIC&amp;pg=PA111|title=The Making of Modern Libya, Ali Abdullatif Ahmida, p 111 |publisher=|accessdate=13 November 2014|isbn=9780791417614 |author1=Ahmida |first1=Ali Abdullatif |year=1994 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Ariel|2013|p=160|ps=: "Moreover, the Libyan Jewish community benefited economically from Ottoman rule. As a result, there was little Jewish emigration during this period. At the same time, however, as European powers increased their economic influence in Libya, Jews increasingly became middlemen between them and the local population. More and more they were seen by Muslim Libyans as aligned with foreign powers. Italian rule soon made this partnership more overt. The colonial rule then further increased Muslim-Jewish conflict, eventually leading to both collective violence and migration. By the end of the Italian period, the Jewish community of Libya was no longer willing to accept a traditional subordinate place in a Muslim society, and in fact was unprepared to live in an independent Arab Muslim state."}}

The Alliance Israelite Universelle, founded in France in 1860, set up schools in Algeria, Morocco and Tunisia as early as 1863.{{sfn|Laskier|2012}}{{sfn|Chouraqui|2002f|ps=: "Alliance Israelite Universelle['s first school in Morocco] was opened in 1862 at Tetuan"}}{{sfn|Chouraqui|2002g|ps=: "In 1863, a committee of the Alliance Israelite Universelle was set up in Tunisia ... and intervened effectively whenever an official measure was taken that might have discriminated against the Jews."}}

===World War II===
During World War II, Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia and Libya came under [[Nazi]] or [[Operation Torch#Background|Vichy French]] occupation and their Jews were subject to various persecution. In Libya, the Axis powers established [[Italian concentration camps in Libya|labor camps]] to which many Jews were forcibly deported.&lt;ref name=berkeley&gt;[http://sunsite.berkeley.edu/JewsofLibya/LibyanJews/thejews.html History of the Jewish Community in Libya] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060718035942/http://sunsite.berkeley.edu/JewsofLibya/LibyanJews/thejews.html |date=18 July 2006 }}".

From 1943 until the mid 1960s, the [[American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee]] was an important foreign organization driving change and modernization in the North African Jewish community.&lt;ref name=Bauer1981&gt;{{cite book|author=Yehuda Bauer|title=American Jewry and the Holocaust: The American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee, 1939-1945|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WOd3rLul-LcC&amp;pg=PA224|year=1981|publisher=Wayne State University Press|isbn=0-8143-1672-7|page=224|quote=In 1943, JDC increased its involvement in North Africa, a decision made in response to new conditions.

As in Tunisia and Algeria, [[Moroccan Jews]] did not face large scale expulsion or outright asset confiscation or any similar government persecution during the period of exile, and Zionist agents were relatively allowed freedom of action to encourage emigration.&lt;ref name=Lask349&gt;{{harvnb|Laskier|1994|p=349}}: "... the policies adopted by Nasser's Egypt or Syria such as internment in prison camps, sequestration, or even outright confiscation of assets, and large-scale expulsions (as was the case with Egyptian Jews in 1956-57), were never implemented by Muhammad V, Hasan II, Bourguiba, or the FLN. The freedom of action granted in Algeria, Morocco (since 1961), and Tunisia to Jewish emigration societies... was unparalleled elsewhere in the Arab world. These organizations enjoyed greater legality than government opponents who were Muslims  ... albeit managed by foreigners and financed from abroad."&lt;/ref&gt;

In Morocco the Vichy regime during World War II passed discriminatory laws against Jews; for example, Jews were no longer able to get any form of credit, Jews who had homes or businesses in European neighborhoods were expelled, and quotas were imposed limiting the percentage of Jews allowed to practice professions such as law and medicine to no more than two percent.&lt;ref&gt;Stillman, 2003, pp. 127–128.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Disputed inline|reason=Contradicts Xavier Cornut JPost article - need quote from Stillman to clarify.|date=January 2016}} [[Mohammed V of Morocco|King Mohammed V]] expressed his personal distaste for these laws, assuring Moroccan Jewish leaders that he would never lay a hand "upon either their persons or property". While there is no concrete evidence of him actually taking any actions to defend Morocco's Jews, it has been argued that he may have worked on their behalf behind the scenes.&lt;ref&gt;Stillman, 2003, pp. 128–129.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Xavier Cornut, ''Jerusalem Post'', 2009, [http://www.jpost.com/Features/The-Moroccan-connection The Moroccan connection: Exploring the decades of secret ties between Jerusalem and Rabat.], "During World War II, King Muhammad V had refused to apply the anti-Semitic laws of the protectorate imposed by the Vichy regime in France, prompting fidelity from Moroccan Jewry. ... In the late Fifties, before his coronation, he had shocked people during a visit in Lebanon by arguing that the only solution for the enduring conflict was to make peace and incorporate Israel in the Arab League. The king was fascinated by the idea of the "reconciliation of the Semitic brotherhood," although he never expressed it in the early years of his reign, aligning his country with the anti-Israeli alliance."&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 1948, soon after [[Israeli Declaration of Independence|Israel was established]] and in the midst of the [[1948 Arab–Israeli War|first Arab–Israeli war]], [[1948 Oujda and Jerada pogrom|violent anti-Jewish riots]] broke out in Oujda and [[Djerada]], leading to deaths of 44 Jews. In 1948–49, after the massacres, 18,000 Moroccan Jews left the country for Israel. Later, however, the Jewish exodus from Morocco slowed to a few thousand a year. Through the early 1950s, [[Zionism|Zionist]] organizations encouraged emigration, particularly in the poorer south of the country, seeing Moroccan Jews as valuable contributors to the Jewish State:

The third branch was illegal immigration. In the fourth branch, young Moroccan Zionists worked in the underground with the Mossad. Their main function, Havillio explained, was to establish the first contact with jewish families to ask them if they [were] ready and willing to go. The fifth branch was public relations aimed at obtalnlng secret support from key members of the jewish Community.

An agreement with the Moroccans was vital, but he also knew that the Moroccans had to be pushed, and the Jews had to be reassured that the Egoz tragedy did not mean the end of all departures for Israel."}} consistent with Mossad Director [[Isser Harel]]'s scenario that "a wedge had to be forced between the royal government and the Moroccan Jewish community and that anti-Hassan nationalists had to be used as leverage as well if a compromise over emigration was ever to be attained".{{sfn|Szulc|1991|p=259|ps=:"Gattmon's pamphlet corresponded to Harel's scenario - that a wedge had to be forced between the royal government and the Moroccan Jewish community and that anti-Hassan nationalists had to be used as leverage as well if a compromise over emigration was ever to be attained."}} A [[pamphlet]] agitating for illegal emigration, supposedly by an underground Zionist organization, was printed by Mossad and distributed throughout Morocco, causing the government to "hit the roof".{{sfn|Szulc|1991|p=258-259|ps=:"Consequently, he arranged for the clandestine printing of 10,000 copies of a pamphlet declaring that no Jew and no Zionist who wanted to leave Morocco for Israel would be kept against his will in the kingdom; despite the sinking of the Egoz, illegal emigration would continue. It was also intended to convince the king that he should not keep people against their volition in order to foster the belief that Morocco was a tolerant country. The pamphlet, supposedly printed by an underground Zionist organization, was circulated throughout Morocco, and the government hit the roof. The Moroccan ambassador to the United States, Mehdi Ben Aboud, said in a speech before an American Jewish audience in Washington that the wreck of the Egoz had "brought to light [the] clandestine immigration operation... which has been exploited in a premeditated press campaign of distortion intended to serve Zionist purposes... We have had no Jewish problem in Morocco in the past, and we do not have a Jewish problem in Morocco today. Al-Istiqlal magazine, speaking for the nationalist opposition party, wrote that the pamphlets "were distributed by adventurers, hired by the Zionist state.""}} These events prompted King Mohammed V to allow Jewish emigration, and over the three following years, more than 70,000 Moroccan Jews left the country,&lt;ref&gt;Stillman, 2003, p. 174.&lt;/ref&gt; primarily as a result of [[Operation Yachin]].

[[Operation Yachin]] was fronted by the New York-based [[Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society]] (HIAS),{{sfn|Szulc|1991|p=209a|ps=:"History seemed to repeat itself on a steamy day in August 1961 when an emissary from Jerusalem and the head of the principal private American Jewish immigration agency shook hands in New York on a secret agreement to cooperate in negotiating and organizing departures of Jews from Morocco to Israel, both legally and illegally, in the largest postwar enterprise of its kind. The handshake was between Jewish Agency representative Baruch Duvdvani, a sixty-five-year-old veteran of Palestinian illegal immigration operations, and [[Murray Gurfein|Murray I. Gurfein]], a fifty-four-year-old noted American jurist and president of the United HIAS Service."}} who financed approximately $50 million of costs.{{sfn|Szulc|1991|p=210|ps=:"Under the 1961 arrangement between HIAS and the Jewish Agency, over 100,000 Moroccan Jews, including entire villages in the Atlas Mountains, were directly helped by the Americans in emigrating to Israel; thousands more were later indirectly assisted by HIAS in leaving the country. The cost to HIAS, which relied on contributions from American Jewry, was close to $50 million."}} HIAS provided an American cover for underground Israeli agents in Morocco, whose functions included organizing emigration, arming of Jewish Moroccan communities for self-defense and negotiations with the Moroccan government.{{sfn|Szulc|1991|p=209b|ps=:"The essence of their agreement, an oral one, as was customary in such cases, was that HIAS would provide an American cover for the activities of underground Israeli agents in Morocco, which included organizing Jewish emigration from the North African kingdom, the arming of Jewish Moroccan communities for self-defense and a variety of other clandestine programs, in addition to highly discreet negotiations with the Moroccan government to facilitate the Jewish exodus."}} By 1963, the Moroccan Interior Minister [[Mohamed Oufkir|Colonel Oufkir]] and Mossad chief [[Meir Amit]] agreed to swap Israeli training of Moroccan security services and some covert military assistance for intelligence on Arab affairs and continued Jewish emigration.{{sfn|Szulc|1991|p=275|ps=:"By mid-1963, Operation Yakhin had become virtually routine. [[Mohamed Oufkir|Colonel Oufkir]], the new Interior Minister in Morocco, and [[Meir Amit]], the new chief of the Mossad, concluded a secret pact that year providing for the training of Moroccan security services by the Israelis and limited covert military assistance in exchange for a flow of intelligence on Arab affairs and continued free departures of jews. In 1965, the Mossad rendered Oufkir the shocking and sinister service of tracking down [[Mehdi Ben Barka|Mehdi Ben-Barka]], the leader of the leftist opposition in Morocco, whom both the king and his Interior Minister wished dead. Amit agreed to locate Ben-Barka, and Mossad agents persuaded him to come to Paris from Geneva under false pretenses. Near a restaurant, French plainclothesmen arrested Ben-Barka and handed him over to Oufkir's agents. They then took him to the countryside, killed him and buried him in a garden. Investigations by the French government uncovered the truth, and the Ben-Barka affair became a political scandal in France, Morocco and Israel."}}

By 1967, only 50,000 Jews remained.&lt;ref name=Stillman175&gt;Stillman, 2003, p. 175.&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1967 [[Six-Day War]] led to increased Arab–Jewish tensions worldwide, including in Morocco, and significant Jewish emigration out of the country continued. By the early 1970s, the Jewish population of Morocco fell to 25,000; however, most of the emigrants went to France, Belgium, Spain, and Canada, rather than Israel.&lt;ref name=Stillman175/&gt;

Despite their dwindling numbers, Jews continue to play a notable role in Morocco; the King retains a Jewish senior adviser, [[André Azoulay]], and Jewish schools and synagogues receive government subsidies. Despite this, Jewish targets have sometimes been attacked (notably the [[2003 Casablanca bombings|2003 bombing attacks]] on a Jewish community center in Casablanca), and there is sporadic anti-Semitic rhetoric from radical Islamist groups. Invitations from the late King [[Hassan II]] for Jews to return to Morocco have not been taken up by the people who had emigrated.

According to [[Esther Benbassa]], the migration of Jews from the North African countries was prompted by uncertainty about the future.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=UaiipUj3SJ8C&amp;pg=PA186&amp;dq=Tunisia+Jews+france+emigrate|author=Esther Benbassa|title=The Jews of France: A History from Antiquity to the Present |isbn=978-0-691-09014-6 |year=2001 |publisher=Princeton University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1948, over 250,000&lt;ref name="Stearns"/&gt;–265,000&lt;ref name="Avneri"/&gt; Jews lived in Morocco.

===Algeria===
{{See also|History of the Jews in Algeria}}
[[File:Oran synagogue.jpg|left|thumb|upright=0.5|[[Great Synagogue of Oran]], Algeria, confiscated and turned into a mosque after the departure of Jews]]

As in Tunisia and Morocco, [[Algerian Jews]] did not face large scale expulsion or outright asset confiscation or any similar government persecution during the period of exile, and Zionist agents were relatively allowed freedom of action to encourage emigration.&lt;ref name=Lask349/&gt;

Jewish emigration from Algeria was part of a wider ending of French colonial control and the related social, economic and cultural changes.{{sfn|Mandel|2014|p=38a|ps=: "Indeed, although the French premier, Pierre Mendes-France, proposed granting greater autonomy for Tunisia and gradual internal reforms for Morocco in 1954, the early 1950s were characterized by widespread nationalist resistance and concomitant economic, political, and social breakdown. Likewise, in Algeria, the outbreak of anti-French agitation in November 1954, ultimately pitting Front de liberation nationals terrorism against the French military's ruthless tactics, undermined the lives of many residents. In response, thousands of Muslims, Christians, and Jews left the region, often for France but also for Canada, South America, Israel, and elsewhere in Europe. Jewish migration was very much a part of this wider collapse of colonial control and the social, economic, and cultural change that followed.}}

The Israeli government had been successful in encouraging Morocco and Tunisian Jews to emigrate to Israel, but were less so in Algeria. Despite offers of visa and economic subsidies, only 580 Jews moved from Algeria to Israel in 1954-55.{{sfn|Choi|2015|p=84|ps=: "While obtaining a fair level of success in gaining émigrés from Morocco and Tunisia, the government of David Ben-Gurion detected only minimal enthusiasm in Algeria. With the offer of visas and economic subsidies, 580 Jews ended up relocating in Israel between 1954 and 1955."}}

Emigration peaked during the [[Algerian War]] of 1954–1962, during which thousands of Muslims, Christians and Jews left the country,{{sfn|Mandel|2014|p=38b}} particularly the Pied-Noir community. In 1956, Mossad agents worked underground to organize and arm the Jews of Constantine, who comprised approximately half the Jewish population of the country.{{sfn|Choi|2015|p=85|ps=: "Taking serious interest in the possible stakes raised by Arab nationalism in Algeria, the Israeli government did not limit its intervention to consular affairs. In 2005, the Israeli daily newspaper, the Maariv, carried a story about the historical activities of the Mossad in Algeria during the war of independence. The article cited interviews with former Mossad agents who recounted working underground and arming the young Jews of Constantine during the Algerian War to rout the ALN. Two former Mossad members, Shlomo Havilio and "agent" Avraham Barzilai, now 78, spoke openly about having been sent by Israeli special services to Algeria in 1956 to organize underground Jewish cells. They had in fact crossed into Algeria from Egypt where they had taken part in organizing armed resistance against Egyptian president Gamal Nasser."}} In Oran, a Jewish counter-insurgency movement was thought to have been trained by former members of [[Irgun]].{{sfn|Choi|2015|p=86|ps=: "Constantine was not the only region in which there was active militant intervention on the part of Israeli organizations. French sources concerning the surveillance of Israeli military activity in Algeria are not open to public viewing, but documents issued by the Information services in La Rocher allude strongly (laissé entendre) to the active presence in Oran of former Irgun (the Israeli national military Organization) members and to their training of Algerian Jewish commandos. In fact, French intelligence reports refer repeatedly to persistent rumors about a Jewish counter-insurgency movement consisting solely of Oranais Jewish youth who had come back from Israel where they received military training. No other evidence was given in the French surveillance reports save for mention that the tactics used by the Constantine Jewish militants resembled those once used by the Irgun."}}

As of the last census in Algeria, taken on 1 June 1960, there were 1,050,000 non-Muslim civilians in Algeria (10 percent of the total population including 130,000."

Of the latter, there were still about 100,000 in 1965 and about 50,000 by the end of the 1960s.&lt;ref name="ladepeche"&gt;[http://www.ladepeche.fr/article/2012/03/10/1308713-pieds-noirs-ceux-qui-ont-choisi-de-rester.html "Pieds-noirs": ceux qui ont choisi de rester], [[La Dépêche du Midi]], March 2012 {{fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the [[Algerian Revolution]] began to intensify in the late 1950s and early 1960s, most of Algeria's 140,000 Jews began to leave.{{sfn|Fischbach|2008|p=95}} The community had lived mainly in [[Algiers]] and [[Blida]], Constantine, and Oran.

The Algiers synagogue was consequently abandoned after 1994.

Jewish migration from North Africa to France led to the rejuvenation of the [[History of the Jews in France#Today|French Jewish]] community, which is now the third largest in the world.

===Libya===
{{see also|History of the Jews in Libya}}
According to Maurice Roumani, a Libyan emigrant who was previously the Executive Director of [[WOJAC]],&lt;ref&gt;Yehouda Shenhav. [http://people.socsci.tau.ac.il/mu/yshenhav/files/2013/07/Ethnicity-and-National-Memory.pdf Ethnicity and National Memory: The World Organization of Jews from Arab Countries (WOJAC) in the Context of the Palestinian National Struggle]. British Journal of Middle Eastern Studies. Volume 29, Issue 1, 2002, Pages 27 - 56.&lt;/ref&gt; the most important factors that influenced the Libyan Jewish community to emigrate were "the scars left from the last years of the Italian occupation and the entry of the British Military in 1943 accompanied by the Jewish Palestinian soldiers".{{sfn|Roumani|2009|p=133 #1|ps= "As stated above, many factors influenced and strengthened the determination of the Jewish community in Libya to emigrate. Most important were the scars left from the last years of the Italian occupation and the entry of the British Military in 1943 accompanied by the Jewish Palestinian soldiers. These soldiers played an instrumental role in reviving Zionism in the community and turning it into a pragmatic program to fulfill the dream of immigrating to Israel. Moreover, the rise of nationalism and preparations for independence made many members of the community suspicious and apprehensive about their future in Libya. The difficulties raised by the British in allowing Libyan Jews to immigrate dampened the enthusiasm of many, however."}}

Zionist emissaries, "shlichim", has begun arriving in the early 1940s, with the intention to "transform the community and transfer it to Palestine".&lt;ref&gt;Rachel Simon, [http://jcpa.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/schlichim-in-palestine.pdf Shlichim from Palestine in Libya], page 50&lt;/ref&gt; In 1943, [[Mossad LeAliyah Bet]] began to send emissaries to prepare the infrastructure for the emigration of the Libyan Jewish community.{{sfn|Roumani|2009|p=133 #2|ps= "The Jewish Agency and the Mossad Le Aliyah Bet (the illegal immigration agency) realized the potential of this immigration and decided as early as the summer of 1943 to send three clandestine emissaries—Yair Doar, Zeev (Vilo) Katz and Naftali Bar-Ghiora—to prepare the infrastructure for aliyah of the Libyan Jewish community. These emissaries played a crucial role in establishing the immigration infrastructure that would later, in a more advanced form, facilitate the mass of immigration of Libyan Jews."}}

In 1942, [[Afrika Korps|German troops]] fighting the [[North African Campaign|Allies in North Africa]] occupied the Jewish quarter of [[Benghazi]], plundering shops and deporting more than 2,000 Jews across the desert. Sent to work in labor camps, more than one-fifth of that group of Jews perished. At the time, most of the Jews were living in cities of [[Tripoli]] and Benghazi and there were smaller numbers in [[Bayda, Libya|Bayda]] and [[Misrata]].&lt;ref name=berkeley /&gt; Following the allied victory at the [[Battle of El Agheila]] in December 1942, German and Italian troops were driven out of Libya. The British installed the [[Palestine Regiment]] in [[Cyrenaica]], which later became the core of the [[Jewish Brigade]], which was later also stationed in [[Tripolitania]]. The pro-Zionist soldiers encouraged the spread of Zionism throughout the local Jewish population{{sfn|Ariel|2013|p=150}}&lt;ref&gt;''[https://books.google.com/books?id=0RY7AwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT42 Jewish Brigade: An Army with Two Masters 1944–45]'', Morris Beckman, The History Press, 2010, pp. 42–52&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Yoav Gelber]], ''Jewish Palestinian Volunteering in the British Army during the Second World War'', Vol. III. ''The Standard Bearers - The Mission of the Volunteers to the Jewish People'', (Hebrew, Yad Izhak Ben-Zvi, Jerusalem 1983).&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the liberation of North Africa by allied forces, antisemitic incitements were still widespread. The most severe racial violence between the start of World War II and the establishment of Israel erupted in [[1945 Tripoli pogrom|Tripoli in November 1945]]. Over a period of several days more than 130 Jews (including 36 children) were killed, hundreds were injured, 4,000 were displaced and 2,400 were reduced to poverty. Five synagogues in Tripoli and four in provincial towns were destroyed, and over 1,000 Jewish residences and commercial buildings were plundered in Tripoli alone.&lt;ref name="Stillman, 2003, p. 145"&gt;Stillman, 2003, p. 145.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gil Shefler]] writes that "As awful as the pogrom in Libya was, it was still a relatively isolated occurrence compared to the mass murders of Jews by locals in Eastern Europe."&lt;ref name="SaadonandShefler"/&gt; The same year, violent anti-Jewish violence also occurred in [[1945 Cairo pogrom|Cairo]], which resulted in 10 Jewish victims.

In 1948, about 38,000 Jews lived in Libya.&lt;ref name="Avneri"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stillman, 2003, pp. 155–156.&lt;/ref&gt; The pogroms continued in June 1948, when 15 Jews were killed and 280 Jewish homes destroyed.&lt;ref&gt;Harris, 2001, pp. 149–150.&lt;/ref&gt; In November 1948, a few months after the events in Tripoli, the American consul in Tripoli, Orray Taft Jr., reported that: "There is reason to believe that the Jewish Community has become more aggressive as the result of the Jewish victories in Palestine. There is also reason to believe that the community here is receiving instructions and guidance from the State of Israel. Whether or not the change in attitude is the result of instructions or a progressive aggressiveness is hard to determine. Even with the aggressiveness or perhaps because of it, both Jewish and Arab leaders inform me that the inter-racial relations are better now than they have been for several years and that understanding, tolerance and cooperation are present at any top level meeting between the leaders of the two communities."{{sfn|Fischbach|2008|p=68}}&lt;ref&gt;NARA RG 84, Libya— Tripoli, General Records 1948–49; file 800–833, Taft to Secretary of State (23 November 1948)&lt;/ref&gt;

Immigration to Israel began in 1949, following the establishment of a [[Jewish Agency for Israel]] office in Tripoli. According to Harvey E. Goldberg, "a number of Libyan Jews" believe that the Jewish Agency was behind the riots, given that the riots helped them achieve their goal.{{sfn|Goldberg|p=156|ps=: "Immigration began when the British authorities granted permission to the Jewish Agency to set up an office in Tripoli and organize the operation. As an indication of how the causes of events can be reinterpreted in terms of their results, a number of Libyan Jews have told me that their guess is that the Jewish Agency was behind the riots, for they clearly had the effect of bringing the Jews to Israel"}} Between the establishment of the State of Israel in 1948 and Libyan independence in December 1951 over 30,000 Libyan Jews emigrated to Israel.

On 31 December 1958 a decree was issued by the President of the Executive Council of Tripolitania, which ordered the dissolution of the Jewish Community Council and the appointment of a Muslim commissioner nominated by the Government. A law issued in 1961 required Libyan citizenship for the possession and transfer of property in Libya, a requirement that was rejected to all but 6 Libyan Jewish individuals. Jews were banned from voting, attaining public offices and from serving in the army or in police.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jcpa.org/article/the-final-exodus-of-the-libyan-jews-in-1967/|title=The Final Exodus of the Libyan Jews in 1967 - Jerusalem Center For Public Affairs|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jimenaexperience.org/libya/about-jimena/past-and-present/|title=Jewish History|website=jimenaexperience.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1967, during the [[Six-Day War]], the Jewish population of 4,000 was again subjected to riots in which 18 were killed,{{citation needed|date=May 2014}} and many more injured. According to [[David Harris (advocate)|David Harris]], the Executive Director of the Jewish advocacy organization [[American Jewish Committee|AJC]], the pro-Western Libyan government of [[Idris of Libya|King Idris I]] "faced with a complete breakdown of law and order ... urged the Jews to leave the country temporarily", permitting them each to take one suitcase and the equivalent of $50. In June and July over 4,000 traveled to Italy, where they were assisted by the Jewish Agency for Israel. 1,300 went on to Israel, 2,200 remained in Italy, and most of the rest went to the United States. A few scores remained in Libya and others managed to return between 1967 and 1969.&lt;ref&gt;Harris, 2001, pp. 155–156, "Finally, faced with a complete breakdown of law and order, the Libyan government urged the Jews to leave the country temporarily. Whereas, in the past, Jews had had considerable difficulty obtaining travel documents, Libyan officials were now visiting Jewish homes and issuing such documents on the spot. Escorts were provided to the airports. But departing Jews were permitted only one suitcase and the equivalent of $50. ... Predictably, the so-called temporary exodus in 1967 became permanent. A few score of Jews remained in Libya, while others managed, in the two years prior to Qaddhafi's coup d'état in September 1969, to return briefly in an attempt to regain their possessions."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Simon, 1999, pp. 3–4.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1970 the Libyan government issued new laws that confiscated all the assets of Libya's Jews, issuing in their stead 15-year bonds. However, when the bonds matured no compensation was paid. Libyan leader [[Muammar Gaddafi]] justified this on the grounds that "the alignment of the Jews with Israel, the Arab nations' enemy, has forfeited their right to compensation."&lt;ref&gt;Harris, 2001, p. 157.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the main synagogue in Tripoli was renovated in 1999, it has not reopened for services. The last Jew in Libya, Esmeralda Meghnagi, died in February 2002. Israel is home to about 40,000 Jews of Libyan descent, who maintain unique traditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Jews in Islamic Countries: Libya|url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/anti-semitism/libyajews.html|work=JVL|accessdate=30 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====1930s and early 1940s====
{{see also|History of the Jews in Iraq|Baghdadi Jews|Kurdish Jews}}
The [[Mandatory Iraq|British mandate over Iraq]] came to an end in June 1930, and in October 1932 the country became independent. The Iraqi government response to the demand of [[Assyrian people|Assyrian]] autonomy (the Assyrians being the [[indigenous peoples|indigenous]] Eastern Aramaic-speaking Semitic descendants of the ancient Assyrians and [[Mesopotamians]], and largely affiliated to the [[Assyrian Church of the East]], [[Chaldean Catholic Church]] and [[Syriac Orthodox Church]]), turned into a [[Simele massacre|bloody massacre]] of [[Assyrians in Iraq#Independent Kingdom of Iraq|Assyrian villagers]] by the Iraqi army in August 1933. This event was the first sign to the Jewish community that minority rights were meaningless under Iraqi monarchy. [[Faisal I of Iraq|King Faisal]], known for his liberal policies, died in September 1933, and was succeeded by [[Ghazi of Iraq|Ghazi]], his nationalistic anti-British son. Ghazi began promoting [[Arab nationalist]] organizations, headed by Syrian and Palestinian exiles. With [[1936–39 Arab revolt in Palestine]], they were joined by rebels, such as the [[Amin al-Husayni|Grand Mufti of Jerusalem]]. The exiles preached pan-Arab ideology and fostered anti-Zionist propaganda.&lt;ref&gt;Gat, M. ''The Jewish Exodus from Iraq, 1948–1951''. p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt;

Under Iraqi nationalists, Nazi propaganda began to infiltrate the country, as Nazi Germany was anxious to expand its influence in the Arab world. Dr. [[Fritz Grobba]], who resided in Iraq since 1932, began to vigorously and systematically disseminate hateful propaganda against Jews. Among other things, Arabic translation of ''[[Mein Kampf]]'' was published and Radio Berlin had begun broadcasting in Arabic language. Anti-Jewish policies had been implemented since 1934, and the confidence of Jews was further shaken by the growing crisis in Palestine in 1936. Between 1936 and 1939 ten Jews were murdered and on eight occasions bombs were thrown on Jewish locations.&lt;ref&gt;Gat, M. ''The Jewish Exodus from Iraq, 1948–1951''. p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Farhud mass grave.jpg|thumb|Mass grave of victims of the [[Farhud]], 1941.]]
In 1941, immediately following the British victory in the [[Anglo-Iraqi War]], riots known as the [[Farhud]] broke out in [[Baghdad]] in the [[power vacuum]] following the collapse of the pro-[[Axis Powers|Axis]] government of [[Rashid Ali al-Gaylani]] while the city was in a state of instability. 180 Jews were killed and another 240 wounded; 586 Jewish-owned businesses were looted and 99 Jewish houses were destroyed.&lt;ref&gt;Levin, Itamar (2001).

In some accounts the Farhud marked the turning point for Iraq's Jews.&lt;ref&gt;''Encyclopedia of Jews in the Islamic World'' ("Either way, the farhūd was a significant turning-point for the Jewish community. In addition to its effect on relations between Iraqi Muslims and Jews, it exacerbated the tensions between the pro-British Jewish notables and the younger elements of the community, who now looked to the Communist Party and Zionism and began to consider emigration.")&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[https://books.google.com/books?id=VxEJrEY22egC&amp;pg=PA350&amp;dq=FARHUD+TURNING+POINT&amp;hl=iw&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=qeb3UreLB8jjswaB8IHABA&amp;ved=0CCkQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=FARHUD%20TURNING%20POINT&amp;f=false The Jews of the Middle East and North Africa in Modern Times, p. 350]''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Esther Meir-Glitzenstein's [https://books.google.com/books?id=ZU2QAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA213&amp;dq=FARHUD+BEGINNING+OF+THE+END&amp;hl=iw&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=YBr4UuXRE8S04AS5s4DICw&amp;ved=0CGoQ6AEwCA#v=onepage&amp;q=FARHUD%20DYNAMICS&amp;f=false book on zionism in Iraq, p. 213]&lt;/ref&gt; Other historians, however, see the pivotal moment for the Iraqi Jewish community much later, between 1948–51, since Jewish communities prospered along with the rest of the country throughout most of the 1940s,{{sfn|Bashkin|2012}}&lt;ref name=Gat&gt;Moshe Gat, [https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Jewish_Exodus_from_Iraq_1948_1951.html?id=o-mbui7U_awC&amp;redir_esc=y ''The Jewish Exodus from Iraq, 1948–1951''], quote(1): "[as a result] of the economic boom and the security granted by the government. ... Jews who left Iraq immediately after the riots, later returned." Quote(2): "Their dream of integration into Iraqi society had been dealt a severe blow by the farhud but as the years passed self-confidence was restored, since the state continued to protect the Jewish community and they continued to prosper." Quote(3): Quoting [[Enzo Sereni]]: "The Jews have adapted to the new situation with the British occupation, which has again given them the possibility of free movement after months of detention and fear."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=LRB/&gt;&lt;ref name=LRB&gt;[http://www.lrb.co.uk/v30/n21/adam-shatz/leaving-paradise London Review of Books, Vol. 30 No. 21 • 6 November 2008, pages 23–25, Adam Shatz], "Yet Sasson Somekh insists that the farhud was not 'the beginning of the end'. Indeed, he claims it was soon 'almost erased from the collective Jewish memory', washed away by 'the prosperity experienced by the entire city from 1941 to 1948'. Somekh, who was born in 1933, remembers the 1940s as a 'golden age' of 'security', 'recovery' and 'consolidation', in which the 'Jewish community had regained its full creative drive'. Jews built new homes, schools and hospitals, showing every sign of wanting to stay. They took part in politics as never before; at Bretton Woods, Iraq was represented by Ibrahim al-Kabir, the Jewish finance minister. Some joined the Zionist underground, but many more waved the red flag. Liberal nationalists and Communists rallied people behind a conception of national identity far more inclusive than the Golden Square's Pan-Arabism, allowing Jews to join ranks with other Iraqis – even in opposition to the British and Nuri al-Said, who did not take their ingratitude lightly."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://jewishvoiceny.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=2165:world-organization-of-jews-from-arab-countries-wojac-history-and-purpose&amp;catid=113:oped&amp;Itemid=296 World Organization of Jews from Arab Countries (WOJAC): History and Purpose, 17 October 2012, Heskel M.

Either way, the Farhud is broadly understood to mark the start of a process of politicization of the Iraqi Jews in the 1940s, primarily among the younger population, especially as a result of the impact it had on hopes of long term integration into Iraqi society. In the direct aftermath of the Farhud, many joined the [[Iraqi Communist Party]] in order to protect the Jews of Baghdad, yet they did not want to leave the country and rather sought to fight for better conditions in Iraq itself.{{sfn|Bashkin|2012|p=141–182}} At the same time the Iraqi government that had taken over after the Farhud reassured the Iraqi Jewish community, and normal life soon returned to Baghdad, which saw a marked betterment of its economic situation during World War II.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gat|first=Moshe|title=The Jewish exodus from Iraq: 1948–1951|year=1997|publisher=Cass|location=London [u.a.]|isbn=071464689X|pages=23–24|edition=1. publ.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Friedman|first=Shlomo Hillel ; translated by Ina|title=Operation Babylon |year=1988 |publisher=Collins |location=London |isbn=978-0002179843}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shortly after the Farhud in 1941, Mossad LeAliyah Bet sent emissaries to Iraq to begin to organize emigration to Israel, initially by recruiting people to teach Hebrew and hold lectures on Zionism. In 1942, [[Shaul Avigur]], head of [[Mossad LeAliyah Bet]], entered Iraq undercover in order to survey the situation of the Iraqi Jews with respect to immigration to Israel.{{sfn|Szulc|1991|p=206|ps=:"Even as Schwartz spoke, the Joint was secretly underwriting and helping organize Jewish emigration from Yemen, Aden and Iraq. In late 1946, the Mossad launched Operations Ezra and Nehemiah (known together as Operation Babylon) to save Jews from successive regimes in Iraq. This was really the second phase of an operation that dated back to March 1942, when Avigur smuggled himself into Iraq. Ephraim Krasner Dekel, the head of the Shai, had introduced Avigur to a Jewish sergeant in a British Army transport company which ran regular routes between Tel Aviv and Baghdad. Avigur disguised himself as the assistant driver of a military truck - it was the only time in his life he ever wore any military uniform - and went to survey the situation of the Iraqi jewish community of some 150,000, one of the oldest Jewish communities in the world. After crossing the Syrian desert in unbearable heat, Avigur wasted no time in Baghdad contacting Jewish community leaders."}} During the 1942–43, Avigur made four further trips to Baghdad to arrange the required Mossad machinery, including a radio transmitter for sending information to Tel Aviv, which remained in use for 8 years.{{sfn|Szulc|1991|p=208a|ps=:"During 1942 and 1943, Avigur made four more secret trips to Baghdad to set up the Mossad machlnery, including the installation of a clandestine radio transmitter that broadcast dally to Tel Aviv headquarters for eight years."}} In late 1942, one of the emissaries explained the size of their task of converting the Iraqi community to Zionism, writing that "we have to admit that there is not much point in [organizing and encouraging emigration]. ... We are today eating the fruit of many years of neglect, and what we didn't do can't be corrected now through propaganda and creating one-day-old enthusiasm."{{sfn|Meir-Glitzenstein|2004|p=64–65|ps=: Sereni's letter stated "If we thought before we came here and when we started our work that our main task would be to organize and encourage—today we have to admit that there is not much point in either of these activities. ... We are today eating the fruit of many years of neglect, and what we didn't do can't be corrected now through propaganda and creating one-day-old enthusiasm. ... We have to prepare for the future, to educate a generation of young people, to prepare a young guard that can do our work here. Forming a Zionist organization, a youth movement, a vanguard are the main tasks of the hour."}} It was not until 1947 that legal and illegal departures from Iraq to Israel began.{{sfn|Szulc|1991|p=208b|ps=:"But Jewish departures, legal and illegal, did not start from Iraq until 1947, when enough pressures and bribery finally moved the royal government to let the Jews go, albeit gradually."}} Around 8,000 Jews left Iraq between 1919–48, with another 2,000 leaving between mid-1948 to mid-1950.&lt;ref name=Marqusee&gt;[[Mike Marqusee]], "Diasporic Dimensions" in If I am Not for Myself, Journey of an Anti-Zionist Jew, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

====1948 Arab–Israeli War====
In 1948, there were approximately 150,000 Jews in Iraq. The community was concentrated in Baghdad and [[Basra]].

Before [[United Nations Partition Plan for Palestine]] vote, the Iraq's prime minister [[Nuri al-Said]] told British diplomats that if the United Nations solution was not "satisfactory", "severe measures should [would?] be taken against all Jews in Arab countries".&lt;ref&gt;Morris 2008, p. 412&lt;/ref&gt; In a speech at the General Assembly Hall at Flushing Meadow, New York, on Friday, 28 November 1947, Iraq's Foreign Minister, Fadel Jamall, included the following statement: "Partition imposed against the will of the majority of the people will jeopardize peace and harmony in the Middle East. Not only the uprising of the Arabs of Palestine is to be expected, but the masses in the Arab world cannot be restrained. The Arab–Jewish relationship in the Arab world will greatly deteriorate. There are more Jews in the Arab world outside of Palestine than there are in Palestine. In Iraq alone, we have about one hundred and fifty thousand Jews who share with Moslems and Christians all the advantages of political and economic rights. Harmony prevails among Moslems, Christians and Jews. But any injustice imposed upon the Arabs of Palestine will disturb the harmony among Jews and non-Jews in Iraq; it will breed inter-religious prejudice and hatred."&lt;ref name="unispal.un.org"&gt;{{Citation|url=https://unispal.un.org/UNISPAL.NSF/0/93DCDF1CBC3F2C6685256CF3005723F2 |accessdate=15 October 2013 |title=U.N General Assembly, A/PV.126,28 November 1947, discussion on the Palestinian question |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131016084808/http://unispal.un.org/UNISPAL.NSF/0/93DCDF1CBC3F2C6685256CF3005723F2 |archivedate=16 October 2013 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 19 February 1949, al-Said acknowledged the bad treatment that the Jews had been victims of in Iraq during the recent months. He warned that unless Israel would behave itself, events might take place concerning the Iraqi Jews.&lt;ref name="UN1949NuriSaid1949"/&gt; Al-Said's threats had no impact at the political level on the fate of the Jews but were widely published in the media.{{sfn| Meir-Glitzenstein|2004|p=206 #1|ps=: "Although Nuri's threats had no impact on the fate of the Jews on the political level, they were prominently publicized in the media."}}

In 1948, the country was placed under martial law, and the penalties for Zionism were increased. Courts martial were used to intimidate wealthy Jews, Jews were again dismissed from civil service, quotas were placed on university positions, Jewish businesses were boycotted (E. Black, p.&amp;nbsp;347) and [[Shafiq Ades]] (one of the most important anti-Zionist Jewish businessmen in the country) was arrested and publicly hanged for allegedly selling goods to Israel, shocking the community (Tripp, 123). The Jewish community general sentiment was that if a man as well connected and powerful as [[Shafiq Ades]] could he eliminated by the state, other Jews would not be protected any longer.&lt;ref name="Bashkin2012p90"&gt;{{harvnb|Bashkin|2012|p=90}}: "the general sentiment was chat if a man as well connected and powerful as Adas could he eliminated by the state, other Jews would not be protected any longer."&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, like most [[Arab League]] states, Iraq forbade any legal emigration of its Jews on the grounds that they might go to Israel and could strengthen that state. At the same time, increasing government oppression of the Jews fueled by anti-Israeli sentiment together with public expressions of antisemitism created an atmosphere of fear and uncertainty.

Like most [[Arab League]] states, Iraq initially forbade the emigration of its Jews after the 1948 war on the grounds that allowing them to go to Israel would strengthen that state. However, by 1949 Jews were escaping Iraq at about a rate of 1,000 a month.&lt;ref name="Simon, Reguer, and Laskier, p.365"&gt;Simon, Reguer, and Laskier, p. 365&lt;/ref&gt; At the time, the British believed that the Zionist underground was agitating in Iraq in order to assist US fund-raising and to "offset the bad impression caused by the Jewish attitudes to Arab refugees".{{sfn|Shiblak|1986|ps=: "In a confidential telegram sent on 2 November 1949, the British ambassador to Washington explained ... the general view of officials in the State Department is that the [Zionist] agitation has been deliberately worked up for two reasons:&lt;br&gt;
(a) To assist fund-raising in the United States&lt;br&gt;
(b) To create favourable sentiments in the United Nations Assembly to offset the bad impression caused by the Jewish attitudes to Arab refugees. They suggest that the Israeli Government is fully aware of the Iraqi Jews, but is prepared to be callous towards the community, the bulk of which, as [[Eliahu Eilat|Dr Elath]] admitted, has no wish to transfer its allegiance to Israel."}}

The Iraqi government took in only 5,000 of the [[1948 Palestinian exodus|c.700,000 Palestinians who became refugees]] in 1948–49 and refused to submit to American and British pressure to admit more.{{sfn| Meir-Glitzenstein|2004|p=296|ps=: "Throughout that time (1948–1949), Iraq took in only about 5,000 refugees and consistently refused to admit any more, despite British and American efforts to persuade Iraq and Syria to do more to solve the problem."}} In January 1949, the pro-British Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Said discussed the idea of deporting Iraqi Jews to Israel with British officials, who explained that such a proposal would benefit Israel and adversely affect Arab countries.{{sfn|Shenhav|1999|p=610|ps=: "Shortly after his government assumed power in January 1949, Nuri al-Said toyed with the idea of deporting the Iraqi Jews to Israel. However, the British ambassador in Palestine warned him that such an act could have serious unanticipated repercussions. Israel, the ambassador explained, would welcome the arrival of cheap Jewish labor and would demand that in return the Arab states assimilate Palestinian refugees. In February 1949, the Foreign Office instructed the British ambassador in Baghdad, Sir Henry Mack, to caution Nuri al-Said against expelling the Jews, as this would adversely affect the position of the Arab states."}}&lt;ref&gt;Gat 2013 p. 119,124, 125,127&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Morris 2008, p. 413&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tripp 2002 p. 125&lt;/ref&gt; According to Meir-Glitzenstein, such suggestions were "not intended to solve either the problem of the Palestinian Arab refugees or the problem of the Jewish minority in Iraq, but to torpedo plans to resettle Palestinian Arab refugees in Iraq".{{sfn| Meir-Glitzenstein|2004|p=297a|ps=: "Nuri's proposals for a forced population exchange were not intended to solve either the problem of the Palestinian Arab refugees or the problem of the Jewish minority in Iraq, but to torpedo plans to resettle Palestinian Arab refugees in Iraq. He knew that Britain and the United States would not condone the deportation of Iraqi Jews to Israel."}} In July 1949 the British government proposed to Nuri al-Said a [[population exchange]] in which Iraq would agree to settle 100,000 [[Palestinian refugees]] in Iraq; Nuri stated that if a fair arrangement could be agreed, "the Iraqi government would permit a voluntary move by Iraqi Jews to Palestine."{{sfn|Shenhav|1999|p=613|ps=: "In July 1949, the British, fearing the decline of their influence in the Middle East, put forward a proposal for a population transfer and tried to persuade Nuri al-Said to settle 100,000 Palestinian refugees in Iraq. A letter sent by the British Foreign Office to its legations in the Middle East spoke of an "arrangement whereby Iraqi Jews moved into Israel, received compensation for their property from the Israeli government, while the Arab refugees were installed with the property in Iraq". The British Foreign Office believed that "the Israeli government would find it hard to resist an opportunity of bringing a substantial number of Jews to Israel." In return, Nuri al-Said demanded that half the Palestinian refugees be settled in the territory of Palestine and the rest in the Arab states. If the refugee arrangement were indeed fair, he said, the Iraqi government would permit a voluntary move by Iraqi Jews to Palestine. Under the terms of the plan, an international committee was to assess the value of the property left behind by the Palestinian refugees who would be settled in Iraq, and they would receive restitution drawn from the property of the Iraqi Jews who would be sent to Palestine.... In October 1949, the world and Israeli press reported the Iraqi-British plan for a population exchange (e.g., Davar, 16 October 1949). The publicity embarrassed the other Arab leaders and caused a stir in the refugee camps of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip. In a message to the Foreign Office, [[Henry Mack (diplomat)|Henry Mack]], the British ambassador to Iraq, said that the Palestinian refugees would not agree to settle in Iraq."}} The Iraqi-British proposal was reported in the press in October 1949.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Anglo U.S split on policy aggravated by Iraq offer|publisher=The Palestine Post, Jerusalem|date=19 October 1949}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 14 October 1949 Nuri Al Said raised the exchange of population concept with the economic mission survey.&lt;ref name="Tovy2014p163"/&gt; At the Jewish Studies Conference in Melbourne in 2002, Philip Mendes summarised the effect of al-Saids vacillations on Jewish expulsion as: "In addition, the Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri as-Said tentatively canvassed and then shelved the possibility of expelling the Iraqi Jews, and exchanging them for an equal number of Palestinian Arabs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mefacts.org/cached.asp?x_id=10985|title=The Forgotten Refugees: the causes of the post-1948 Jewish Exodus from Arab Countries - The Case of Iraq|author=Philip Mendes|work=14th Jewish Studies Conference, Melbourne|year=2002|accessdate=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130113093432/http://mefacts.org/cached.asp?x_id=10985|archivedate=13 January 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; "

====A reversal: Allowing a Jewish immigration to Israel====

In March 1950 Iraq reversed their earlier ban on Jewish emigration to Israel and passed a law of one-year duration allowing Jews to emigrate on the condition of relinquishing their Iraqi citizenship. According to [[Abbas Shiblak]], many scholars state that this was a result of British, American and Israeli political pressure on [[Tawfiq al-Suwaidi]]'s government, with some studies suggesting there were secret negotiations.{{sfn|Shiblak|1986|p=79|ps=: "Many studies, however, while not rejecting all the official Iraqi justifications out of hand, see the law as the result of continuous pressure on Iraq from the British, American, and Israeli governments. Some studies go further, regarding Law 1/1950 as the culmination of secret negotiations involving these parties together with the [[Tawfiq al-Suwaidi|al-Suwaidi]] government."}} According to [[Ian Black (journalist)|Ian Black]],&lt;ref name="Black1991p89"/&gt; the Iraqi government was motivated by "economic considerations, chief of which was that almost all the property of departing Jews reverted to the state treasury"&lt;ref name="Black1991p89"/&gt; and also that "Jews were seen as a restive and potentially troublesome minority that the country was best rid of."&lt;ref name="Black1991p89"/&gt; Israel mounted an operation called "[[Operation Ezra and Nehemiah]]" to bring as many of the Iraqi Jews as possible to Israel.

The Zionist movement at first tried to regulate the amount of registrants until issues relating to their legal status were clarified. Later, it allowed everyone to register. Two weeks after the law went into force, the Iraqi interior minister demanded a CID investigation over why Jews were not registering.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}} A few hours after the movement allowed registration, four Jews were injured in a bomb attack at a café in Baghdad.

Immediately following the March 1950 Denaturalisation Act, the emigration movement faced significant challenges. Initially, local Zionist activists forbade the Iraqi Jews from registering for emigration with the Iraqi authorities, because the Israeli government was still discussing absorption planning.{{sfn| Meir-Glitzenstein|2004|p=202a}} However, on 8 April, a bomb exploded in a Jewish cafe in Baghdad, and a meeting of the Zionist leadership later that day agreed to allow registration without waiting for the Israeli government; a proclamation encouraging registration was made throughout Iraq in the name of the State of Israel.&lt;ref name=MG202/&gt; However, at the same time immigrants were also entering Israel from Poland and Romania, countries in which Prime Minister [[David Ben-Gurion]] assessed there was a risk that the communist authorities would soon "close their gates", and Israel therefore delayed the transportation of Iraqi Jews.&lt;ref name=MG204/&gt; As a result, by September 1950, while 70,000 Jews had registered to leave, many selling their property and losing their jobs, only 10,000 had left the country.&lt;ref name=MG203/&gt; According to Esther Meir-Glitzenstein, "The thousands of poor Jews who had left or been expelled from the peripheral cities, and who had gone to Baghdad to wait for their opportunity to emigrate, were in an especially bad state. They were housed in public buildings and were being supported by the Jewish community. The situation was intolerable." The delay became a significant problem for the Iraqi government of Nuri al-Said (who replaced Tawfiq al-Suwaidi in mid-September 1950), as the large number of Jews "in limbo" created problems politically, economically and for domestic security.{{sfn| Meir-Glitzenstein|2004|p=205a}} "Particularly infuriating" to the Iraqi government was the fact that the source of the problem was the Israeli government.

As a result of these developments, al-Said was determined to drive the Jews out of his country as quickly as possible.&lt;ref name=MG205/&gt;&lt;ref name="Glitzenstein2004p205"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Bashkin277/&gt;&lt;ref name=Kirkbride/&gt; On 21 August 1950 al-Said threatened to revoke the license of the company transporting the Jewish exodus if it did not fulfill its daily quota of 500 Jews,{{failed verification|date=May 2014|reason=Not in source, and doesn't make sense as he was not prime minister in August}} and in September 1950, he summoned a representative of the Jewish community and warned the Jewish community of Baghdad to make haste; otherwise, he would take the Jews to the borders himself.&lt;ref name="Hakohen2003p124"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Gat2013p119"/&gt; On 12 October 1950, Nuri al-Said summoned a senior official of the transport company and made similar threats, justifying the expulsion of Jews by the number of Palestinian Arabs fleeing from Israel.{{citation needed|date=May 2014|reason=Is this the same as the August reference above?possible sourced- Gat 2013 p. 115}}

Two months before the law expired, after about 85,000 Jews had registered, a [[1950–1951 Baghdad bombings|bombing campaign]] began against the Jewish community of Baghdad. The Iraqi government convicted and hanged a number of suspected Zionist agents for perpetrating the bombings, but the issue of who was responsible remains a subject of scholarly dispute. All but a few thousand of the remaining Jews then registered for emigration. In all, about 120,000 Jews left Iraq.

According to Gat, it is highly likely that one of Nuri as-Said's motives in trying to expel large numbers of Jews was the desire to aggravate Israel's economic problems (he had declared as such to the Arab world), although Nuri was well aware that the absorption of these immigrants was the policy on which Israel based its future.&lt;ref&gt;Gat 2013 p. 119&lt;/ref&gt; The Iraqi Minister of Defence told the U.S ambassador that he had reliable evidence that the emigrating Jews were involved in activities injurious to the state and were in contact with communist agents.&lt;ref&gt;Gat 2013 p. 128&lt;/ref&gt;

Between April 1950 and June 1951, Jewish targets in Baghdad were struck five times. Iraqi authorities then arrested 3 Jews, claiming they were Zionist activists, and sentenced two — Shalom Salah Shalom and Yosef Ibrahim Basri—to death. The third man, Yehuda Tajar, was sentenced to 10 years in prison.&lt;ref name="Hirst"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Hirst |first=David |authorlink=David Hirst (journalist) |title=The gun and the olive branch: the roots of violence in the Middle East |publisher=Nation Books |date=25 August 2003 |page=400 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ALVtAAAAMAAJ |isbn=1-56025-483-1 |accessdate=5 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May and June 1951, arms caches were discovered that allegedly belonged to the Zionist underground, allegedly supplied by the [[Yishuv]] after the Farhud of 1941.{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}} There has been much debate as to whether the bombs were planted by the [[Mossad]] to encourage Iraqi Jews to emigrate to Israel or if they were planted by Muslim extremists to help drive out the Jews.

The emigration law was to expire in March 1951, one year after the law was enacted. On 10 March 1951, 64,000 Iraqi Jews were still waiting to emigrate, the government enacted a new law blocking the assets of Jews who had given up their citizenship, and extending the emigration period.{{sfn| Meir-Glitzenstein|2004|p=206 #2|ps=: "On 10 March 1951, precisely one year after the Denaturalization Law had come into effect, when 64,000 people were still waiting to emigrate, the Iraqi legislature enacted a law blocking the assets of Jews who had given up their citizenship."}}

The bulk of the Jews leaving Iraq did so via Israeli airlifts named [[Operation Ezra and Nehemiah]] with special permission from the Iraqi government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.moia.gov.il/English/FeelingIsrael/AboutIsrael/Pages/ezraVenechmia.aspx|title=Operation Ezra and Nehemiah – the Aliyah of Iraqi Jewry (1950-1951)|publisher=Israeli Ministry of Aliyah and Immigrant Absorption}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====After 1951====
In 1969, about 50 of the Jews who remained were executed; 11 were publicly executed after [[show trial]]s and hundred thousand Iraqis marched past the bodies in a carnival-like atmosphere.&lt;ref&gt;''Republic of fear: the politics of modern Iraq'' By Kanan Makiya, chapter 2 "A World of Fear", University of California 1998&lt;/ref&gt;

====Background====
Although there was a small indigenous community, most Jews in Egypt in the early twentieth century were recent immigrants to the country,{{Failed verification|reason=Article does not support that the Egyptian Jews were recent immigrants.|date=December 2014}} who did not share the Arabic language and culture.&lt;ref name="Kramer-p233" &gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=n6qjaDq1sRwC&amp;pg=PA233 The Jews in Modern Egypt, 1914–1952, Gudrun Krämer], page 233, Quote: "Not only were they not Muslim, and mainly not of Egyptian origin; most of them did not share the Arabic language and culture, either. Added to these factors was their political diversity."&lt;/ref&gt; Many were members of the highly diverse [[Mutamassirun]] community, which included other groups such as Greeks, Armenians, Syrian Christians and Italians, in addition to the British and French colonial powers.{{sfn|Gorman|2003|p=174-5}} Until the late 1930s, the Jews, both indigenous and new immigrants, like other minorities tended to apply for foreign citizenship in order to benefit from a foreign protection.&lt;ref&gt;Kramer 1989 p. 31&lt;/ref&gt; The Egyptian government made it very difficult for non-Muslim foreigners to become naturalized. The poorer Jews, most of them indigenous and Oriental Jews, were left stateless, although they were legally eligible for Egyptian nationality.&lt;ref&gt;Kramer 1989 p. 34&lt;/ref&gt; The drive to Egyptianize public life and the economy harmed the minorities, but the Jews had more strikes against them than the others. In the agitation against the Jews of the late thirties and the forties, the Jew has been seen as an enemy&lt;ref name="Kramer-p233"/&gt; The Jews were attacked because of their real or alleged links to Zionism. Jews were not discriminated because of their religion or race, like in Europe, but for political reasons.&lt;ref&gt;Kramer 1989 p. 234&lt;/ref&gt;

The Egyptian Prime Minister [[Mahmoud an-Nukrashi Pasha]] told the British ambassador:
"All Jews were potential Zionists [and] ... anyhow all Zionists were Communists."&lt;ref&gt;Morris 2008 p. 412&lt;/ref&gt;
On 24 November 1947, the head of the Egyptian delegation to the [[United Nations]] General Assembly, Muhammad Hussein Heykal Pasha, said, "the lives of 1,000,000 Jews in Moslem countries would be jeopardized by the establishment of a Jewish state."&lt;ref name="morris2008p67"&gt;{{cite book|author=Benny Morris|title=1948: a history of the first Arab-Israeli war|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=J5jtAAAAMAAJ|accessdate=13 July 2013|year=2008|publisher=Yale University Press|page=70}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 24 November 1947, Dr Heykal Pasha said: "if the U.N decide to amputate a part of Palestine in order to establish a Jewish state, ... Jewish blood will necessarily be shed elsewhere in the Arab world ... to place in certain and serious danger a million Jews. Mahmud Bey Fawzi (Egypt) said: "Imposed partition was sure to result in bloodshed in Palestine and in the rest of the Arab world."&lt;ref&gt;[https://unispal.un.org/UNISPAL.NSF/5ba47a5c6cef541b802563e000493b8c/49e8cf7b046bf55b85256a7200671a8e/$FILE/gapal83.pdf 29th Meeting of the Ad Hoc Committee on Palestine: 24 November 1947: Retrieved 31 December 2013] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131231000442/http://unispal.un.org/UNISPAL.NSF/5ba47a5c6cef541b802563e000493b8c/49e8cf7b046bf55b85256a7200671a8e/%24FILE/gapal83.pdf |date=31 December 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The exodus of the foreign mutamassirun ("Egyptianized") community, which included a significant number of Jews, began following the First World War, and by the end of the 1960s the entire mutamassirun was effectively eliminated. According to Andrew Gorman, this was primarily a result of the "decolonization process and the rise of [[Egyptian nationalism]]".{{sfn|Gorman|2003|p=176 #1|ps=: "In the course of the 40 years from the end of the First World War until the early sixties, this considerable mutamassir presence was effectively eliminated, a casualty of the decolonization process and the rise of Egyptian nationalism. The relation between these two phenomena was exacerbated by British policy."}}{{sfn|Gorman|2003|p=176 #2|ps=: "During the Second World War, at the insistence of British authorities, adult male Italian citizens were incarcerated as enemy aliens. In 1948, the foundation of Israel made the position of all Jews in Egypt increasingly tenuous, no matter what their nationality, and the position of Greeks was affected by the vicissitudes of the Greek Civil War in the 1940s. Another critical setback came during the Suez crisis in 1956 when all those who held British and French citizenship were deemed enemy aliens and expelled from the country."}}

The exodus of Egyptian Jews was impacted by the [[1945 Anti-Jewish Riots in Egypt]], though such emigration was not significant as the government stamped the violence out and the Egyptian Jewish community leaders were supportive of [[Farouk of Egypt|King Farouk]]. In 1948, approximately 75,000 Jews lived in Egypt. Around 20,000 Jews left Egypt during 1948–49 following the events of the 1948 Arab–Israeli War (including the [[1948 Cairo bombings]]).&lt;ref name=Marqusee/&gt; A further 5,000 left between 1952–56, in the wake of the [[Egyptian Revolution of 1952]] and later the [[false flag]] [[Lavon Affair]].&lt;ref name=Marqusee/&gt; The Israeli invasion as part of the [[Suez Crisis]] caused a significant upsurge in emigration, with [[1956–57 exodus and expulsions from Egypt|14,000 Jews leaving]] in less than six months between November 1956 and March 1957, and 19,000 further emigrating over the next decade.&lt;ref name=Marqusee/&gt;

====Suez Crisis====
In October 1956, when the Suez Crisis erupted, the position of the mutamassirun, including the Jewish community, was significantly impacted.{{sfn|Gorman|2003|p=177|ps=: "Hand in hand with the British retreat from empire came the rise of a strident even chauvinist Arab nationalism, particularly after 1956. Since at least the 1930s the dominance of foreign interests in many parts of the Egyptian economy, had prompted increasing calls for Egyptianization. The initial measures, while slow to take effect, made it progressively difficult for foreign nationals, resident or not, to own and operate business interests or maintain employment. The situation became more difficult following Suez, when a large number of businesses owned by British and French nationals were confiscated. The final blow came in 1961 when, though not aimed specifically at the mutamassirun, the nationalization laws effectively deprived many of their livelihoods. The emigration, already well underway, now seemed unstoppable."}}

1,000 Jews were arrested and 500 Jewish businesses were seized by the government. A statement branding the Jews as "Zionists and enemies of the state" was read out in the mosques of Cairo and Alexandria.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}} Jewish bank accounts were confiscated and many Jews lost their jobs. Lawyers, engineers, doctors and teachers were not allowed to work in their professions. Thousands of Jews were ordered to leave the country. They were allowed to take only one suitcase and a small sum of cash, and forced to sign declarations "donating" their property to the Egyptian government. Foreign observers reported that members of Jewish families were taken hostage, apparently to insure that those forced to leave did not speak out against the Egyptian government. Jews were expelled or left, forced out by the anti-Jewish feeling in Egypt.&lt;ref name="Hopwood2002p56"/&gt; Some 25,000 Jews, almost half of the Jewish community left, mainly for Europe, the United States, South America and Israel, after being forced to sign declarations that they were leaving voluntarily, and agreed with the confiscation of their assets. Similar measures were enacted against British and French nationals in retaliation for the invasion. By 1957 the Jewish population of Egypt had fallen to 15,000.&lt;ref name=JVL-Jewish-Refugees-from-Arab-Countries&gt;{{cite web|title=Jewish Refugees from Arab Countries|url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/talking/jew_refugees.html|work=JVL|accessdate=30 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Later====
In 1960, the American embassy in Cairo wrote of Egyptian Jews that: "There is definitely a strong desire among most Jews to emigrate, but this is prompted by the feeling that they have limited opportunity, or from fear for the future, rather than by any direct or present tangible mistreatment at the hands of the government."&lt;ref&gt;NARA 886B. 41 1/2-2060, Cairo to Department of State (20 February 1960)&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Fischbach|2008|p=47}}

In 1967, Jews were detained and tortured, and Jewish homes were confiscated.&lt;ref name=Schwartz/&gt;{{Failed verification|date=November 2012}} Following the Six Day War, the community practically ceased to exist, with the exception of several dozens of elderly Jews.{{Citation needed|date=November 2012}}

===Yemen===
{{main|Operation Magic Carpet (Yemen)}}
{{see also|Yemenite Jews|History of the Jews in Aden}}

The Yemeni exodus began in 1881, seven months prior to the more well-known [[First Aliyah]] from Eastern Europe.{{sfn|Parfitt|1996|p=51}} The exodus came about as a result of European Jewish investment in the [[Mutasarrifate of Jerusalem]], which created jobs for labouring Jews alongside local Muslim labour thereby providing an economic incentive for emigration.{{sfn|Parfitt|1996|p=52}} This was aided by the reestablishment of Ottoman control over the [[Yemen Vilayet]] allowing freedom of movement within the empire, and the opening of the [[Suez canal]], which reduced the cost of travelling considerably. Between 1881 and 1948, 15,430 Jews had immigrated to Palestine legally.{{sfn|Ariel|2013|p=71}}

In 1942, prior to the formulation of the [[One Million Plan]], David Ben-Gurion described his intentions with respect to such potential policy to a meeting of experts and Jewish leaders, stating that "It is a mark of great failure by Zionism that we have not yet eliminated the Yemen exile [diaspora]."{{sfn|Shenhav|2006|p=31}}

If one includes [[Aden]], there were about 63,000 Jews in Yemen in 1948. Today, there are about 200 left. In 1947, [[1947 Aden pogrom|rioters killed at least 80 Jews in Aden]], a British colony in southern Yemen. In 1948 the new [[Zaidiyyah|Zaydi]] Imam [[Ahmad bin Yahya]] unexpectedly allowed his Jewish subjects to leave Yemen, and tens of thousands poured into Aden. The Israeli government's [[Operation Magic Carpet (Yemen)|Operation Magic Carpet]] evacuated around 44,000 Jews from Yemen to Israel in 1949 and 1950.&lt;ref name=Stillman156-157&gt;Stillman, 2003, pp. 156–57.&lt;/ref&gt; Emigration continued until 1962, when the [[North Yemen Civil War|civil war in Yemen]] broke out. A small community remained until 1976, though it has mostly immigrated from Yemen since. In March 2016, the Jewish population in Yemen was estimated to be about 50.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.msn.com/en-us/news/world/mission-to-airlift-jews-out-of-yemen-heralds-the-end-of-one-of-oldest-jewish-communities/ar-BBqLwuU |title=Mission to airlift Jews out of Yemen heralds the end of one of oldest Jewish communities |first=Kim |last=Sengupta |date=22 March 2016 |work=[[The Independent]] |accessdate=23 March 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160322083906/http://www.msn.com/en-us/news/world/mission-to-airlift-jews-out-of-yemen-heralds-the-end-of-one-of-oldest-jewish-communities/ar-BBqLwuU |archivedate=22 March 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lebanon and Syria===

====Background====
{{see also|History of the Jews in Lebanon|History of the Jews in Syria}}
The area now known as Lebanon and Syria was the home of one of the oldest Jewish communities in the world, dating back to at least 300 BCE.

====Lebanon====
[[File:Maghen Abraham Synagogue (side).JPG|thumb|upright=1.4|[[Maghen Abraham Synagogue]] in [[Beirut, Lebanon]]]]

In November 1945, fourteen Jews were killed in anti-Jewish riots in [[Tripoli (Lebanon)|Tripoli]].&lt;ref&gt;Kirsten Schulze. "Lebanon". ''Encyclopedia of Jews in the Islamic World''. Executive Editor [[Norman A. Stillman]]. Brill Online, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike in other Arab countries, the Lebanese Jewish community did not face grave peril during the 1948 Arab–Israel War and was reasonably protected by governmental authorities. Lebanon was also the only Arab country that saw a post-1948 increase in its Jewish population, principally due to the influx of Jews coming from Syria and Iraq.&lt;ref name=Parfitt&gt;Parfitt, Tudor. (2000) p. 91.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1948, there were approximately 24,000 Jews in Lebanon.&lt;ref&gt;Hendler, Sefi (19 August 2006). "Beirut's last Jews". Ynet. Retrieved on 22 May 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; The largest communities of Jews in Lebanon were in [[Beirut]], and the villages near [[Mount Lebanon]], [[Deir al Qamar]], [[Barouk]], [[Bechamoun]], and [[Hasbaya]]. While the French mandate saw a general improvement in conditions for Jews, the Vichy regime placed restrictions on them. The Jewish community actively supported [[Lebanese Independence Day|Lebanese independence]] after World War II and had mixed attitudes toward Zionism.{{Citation needed|date=May 2007}}

However, negative attitudes toward Jews increased after 1948, and, by 1967, most Lebanese Jews had emigrated—to Israel, the United States, Canada, and France. In 1971, Albert Elia, the 69-year-old Secretary-General of the Lebanese Jewish community, was kidnapped in Beirut by Syrian agents and imprisoned under torture in [[Damascus]], along with Syrian Jews who had attempted to flee the country. A personal appeal by the [[U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees]], [[Prince Sadruddin Aga Khan]], to the late President [[Hafez al-Assad]] failed to secure Elia's release.

The remaining Jewish community was particularly hard hit by the [[Lebanese civil war|civil war in Lebanon]], and by the mid-1970s, the community collapsed. In the 1980s, [[Hezbollah]] kidnapped several Lebanese Jewish businessmen, and in the 2004 elections, only one Jew voted in the municipal elections. There are now only between 20 and 40 Jews living in Lebanon.&lt;ref name="jewcy.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jewcy.com/religion-and-beliefs/jews_lebanon_another_perspective|title=The Jews of Lebanon: Another Perspective - Jewcy|date=20 November 2009|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ynetnews.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3292543,00.html|title=Beirut's last Jews|date=19 August 2006|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1948, there were approximately 30,000 Jews in Syria. In 1949, following defeat in the Arab–Israeli War, the CIA-backed [[March 1949 Syrian coup d'état]] installed [[Husni al-Za'im]] as the President of Syria. Za'im permitted the emigration of large numbers of Syrian Jews, and 5,000 left to Israel.{{sfn|Zenner|2000|p=55}}

The subsequent Syrian governments placed severe restrictions on the Jewish community, including barring emigration.{{sfn|Zenner|2000|p=55}} Over the next few years, many Jews managed to escape, and the work of supporters, particularly [[Judy Feld Carr]],&lt;ref name="levin"&gt;Levin, 2001, pp. 200–201.&lt;/ref&gt; in smuggling Jews out of Syria, and bringing their plight to the attention of the world, raised awareness of their situation. Although the Syrian government attempted to stop Syrian Jews from exporting their assets, the American consulate in Damascus noted in 1950 that "the majority of Syrian Jews have managed to dispose of their property and to emigrate to Lebanon, Italy, and Israel".{{sfn|Fischbach|2008|p=31}}&lt;ref&gt;NARA RG 59, 883.411/7-2550, Damascus to Department of State (25 July 1950)&lt;/ref&gt;  In November 1954, the Syrian government lifted its ban on Jewish emigration.{{sfn|Fischbach|2013|p=34}}

In March 1964, the Syrian government issued a decree prohibiting Jews from traveling more than three miles from the limits of their hometowns.&lt;ref&gt;''The Jews of the Middle East and North Africa in Modern Times'', edited by Reeva Spector Simon, Michael Menachem Laskier, Sara Reguer P:329&lt;/ref&gt; During 1967, riots broke out in Damascus and Aleppo. Jews were allowed to leave their homes only for few hours daily. Many Jews found impossible to pursue their business venture because the larger community was boycotting their products. In 1972 demonstrations were held by 1000 Syrian Jews in Damascus, after four woman were killed as they attempted to flee Syria. The protest surprised Syrian authorities, who closely monitored Jewish community, eavesdropped on their telephone conversations, and tampered with their mail.&lt;ref&gt;''The Jews of the Middle East and North Africa in Modern Times'', edited by Reeva Spector Simon, Michael Menachem Laskier, Sara Reguer P:329–330&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the [[Madrid Conference of 1991]], the United States put pressure on the Syrian government to ease its restrictions on Jews, and during Passover in 1992, the government of Syria began granting exit visas to Jews on condition that they did not emigrate to Israel. At that time, the country had several thousand Jews. The majority left for the United States—most to join the large Syrian Jewish community in [[South Brooklyn]], New York—although some went to France and Turkey, and those who wanted to go to Israel were brought there in a two-year covert operation.&lt;ref name="Landis" /&gt;

In 2004, the Syrian government attempted to establish better relations with its emigrants, and a delegation of a dozen Jews of Syrian origin visited Syria in the spring of that year.&lt;ref name="Landis"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://faculty-staff.ou.edu/L/Joshua.M.Landis-1/syriablog/2005/10/jews-of-syria-by-robert-tuttle.htm|title=SyriaComment.com: "The Jews of Syria," By Robert Tuttle|website=faculty-staff.ou.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As of December 2014, only 17 Jews remain in Syria, according to Rabbi Avraham Hamra; nine men and eight women, all over 60 years of age.&lt;ref name="wsj141201"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/a-brief-history-of-the-syrian-jewish-community-1417491186|title=A Brief History of the Syrian Jewish Community|last=Entous|first=Adam|date=1 December 2014|work=Wall Street Journal|accessdate=12 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Transjordan and West Bank===
{{further|Tel Or|Gush Etzion|Jewish Quarter (Jerusalem)}}
{{disputed section|date=December 2016}}

The [[Tel Or]] village was established in 1930 (or 1932) in [[Emirate of Transjordan|Transjordan]] in the vicinity of [[Naharayim]] hydroelectric power plant. The village of Tel Or was the only Jewish village in Transjordan at the time. The village was built as housing compound for operation crews of the power plant and their families,&lt;ref&gt;''Encyclopedia of Zionism and Israel'', ed. Raphael Patai, Herzl Press/McGraw Hill, New York, Vol. 2, p.818&lt;/ref&gt; being predominantly Jewish. Tel Or had existed until its depopulation in 1948 during the Arab–Israeli War, when it was overran by the Transjordanian forces. The families of the employees were evacuated in April 1948, leaving behind only workers with Jordanian ID cards. Following a prolonged battle between Yishuv forces and the Transjordanian Arab Legion in the area, the residents of Tel Or were given an ultimatum to surrender or leave the village. The village of Tel Or was shortly abandoned by the residents, who fled to Yishuv-controlled areas to the West of Jordan.

In 1948 during the [[1948 Arab–Israeli War|Arab–Israeli War]], Jerusalem's Jewish Quarter population of about 2,000 Jews was besieged, and forced to leave en masse. The defenders surrendered on 28 May 1948. Colonel [[Abdullah el Tell]], local commander of the Jordanian [[Arab Legion]], with whom [[Mordechai Weingarten]] negotiated the surrender terms, described the destruction of the Jewish Quarter, in his Memoirs (Cairo, 1959):
[[File:Weingarten and Yehudit.jpg|thumb|right|Weingarten negotiating the surrender with Arab Legion soldiers]]

{{quote|... The operations of calculated destruction were set in motion. ... I knew that the Jewish Quarter was densely populated with Jews who caused their fighters a good deal of interference and difficulty. ... I embarked, therefore, on the shelling of the Quarter with mortars, creating harassment and destruction. ...

As the dawn of Friday, May 28, 1948, was about to break, the Jewish Quarter emerged convulsed in a black cloud—a cloud of death and agony.|Yosef Tekoah (Permanent Representative of Israel to the United Nations) quoting Abdullah el-Tal.&lt;ref name=UN/&gt;}}

While Iranian constitution generally respects minority rights of non-Muslims (though there are some forms of discrimination), the strong anti-Zionist policy of the Islamic Republic of Iran created a tense and uncomfortable situation for Iranian Jews, who became vulnerable for accusation on alleged collaboration with Israel.

Most of 80,000-strong Iranian Jewish community exited Iran between 1978 and early 1980s.{{Citation needed|date=November 2013}} In total, more than 80% of Iranian Jews fled or migrated from the country between 1979 and 2006.&lt;ref name=Mahdi/&gt; A small Jewish community of 7–10 thousands still resides in Iran as a protected minority.{{Citation needed|date=November 2013}}

===Turkey===
{{see also|History of the Jews in Turkey|2003 Istanbul bombings}}

When the Republic of Turkey was established in 1923, [[Aliyah]] was not particularly popular among Turkish Jewry; migration from Turkey to Palestine was minimal in the 1920s.&lt;ref&gt;İlker Aytürk. "Aliya to Mandatory Palestine and Israel". ''Encyclopedia of Jews in the Islamic World''. Executive Editor Norman A. Stillman. Brill Online, 2012. Reference. New York University (NYU). 5 December 2012 [http://referenceworks.brillonline.com/entries/encyclopedia-of-jews-in-the-islamic-world/aliya-to-mandatory-palestine-and-israel-COM_0001450]&lt;/ref&gt;

During 1923-1948, approximately 7,300 Jews emigrated from Turkey to [[Mandatory Palestine|Palestine]].{{sfn|Toktas|2006|p=507a|ps=:"From 1923 to the founding of the State of Israel in 1948, it is estimated that 7,308 Jews emigrated from Turkey to Palestine.}} After the [[1934 Thrace pogroms]] following the [[1934 Turkish Resettlement Law]], immigration to Palestine increased; it is estimated that 521 Jews left for Palestine from Turkey in 1934 and 1,445 left in 1935.{{sfn|Toktas|2006|p=507b}} Immigration to Palestine was organized by the Jewish Agency and the Palestine Aliya Anoar Organization. The [[Varlık Vergisi]], a capital tax established in 1942, was also significant in encouraging emigration from Turkey to Palestine; between 1943 and 1944, 4,000 Jews emigrated."{{sfn|Toktas|2006|p=508}}

The Jews of Turkey reacted very favorably to the creation of the State of Israel. Between 1948 and 1951, 34,547 Jews immigrated to Israel, nearly 40% of the Jewish population at the time.{{sfn|Toktas|2006|p=508a}} Immigration was stunted for several months in November 1948, when Turkey suspended migration permits as a result of pressure from Arab countries.{{sfn|Toktas|2006|p=508b|ps=: "Turkey, having not recognized Israel immediately after its proclamation of statehood, suspended permits to emigrate there in November 1948, in response to objections from Arab countries. However, this restriction did not stop the emigration of Jews by illegal means."}}

In March 1949, the suspension was removed when Turkey officially recognized Israel, and emigration continued, with 26,000 emigrating within the same year. The migration was entirely voluntary, and was primary driven by economic factors given the majority of emigrants were from the lower classes.{{sfn|Toktas|2006|p=505–9|ps=:"However, the emigration of the Jews was not part of a government-mandated population exchange. On the contrary, the Jews immigrated to Israel of their own free will.... In the great wave of 1948–51, a large majority of the emigrants came from the lower classes.... These lower classes were less influenced by the Alliance Israelite Universelle schools and the republic's modernizing trends.... Even so, economic factors were the dominant theme among lower-class emigrants in their motivation to move."}} In fact, the migration of Jews to Israel is the second largest mass emigration wave out of Turkey, the first being the [[population exchange between Greece and Turkey]].{{sfn|Toktas|2006|p=505|ps=:"The migration of Jews from Turkey to Israel is the second largest mass emigration movement out of Turkey, the first being labour migration to Europe. The largest mass emigration of minorities from Turkey was that of the Greeks during the Turkish–Greek population exchanges of the early 1920s."}}

After 1951, emigration of Jews from Turkey to Israel slowed materially.{{sfn|Toktas|2006|p=511|ps=:"After the emigration of 34,547 Turkish Jews to Israel in 1948–51, in the period up to 2001 another 27,473 made their way to the Jewish state.... A total of 6,871 emigrants arrived in Israel in 1952–60, 4,793 in 1961–64, 9,280 in 1965–71, 3,118 in 19702–79, 2,088 in 1980–89, 1,215 in 1990–2000, and 108 in 2001.36 The migration figures then decrease greatly. Only 68 immigrants arrived in Israel in 2002, 53 in 2003 and just 52 in 2004."}}

In the mid 1950s, 10% of those who had moved to Israel returned to Turkey. A new synagogue, the [[Neve Shalom Synagogue|Neve Şalom]], was constructed in [[Istanbul]] in 1951. Generally, Turkish Jews in Israel have integrated well into society and are not distinguishable from other Israelis.&lt;ref&gt;Toktas, Sule. "Cultural Identity, Minority Position and Immigration: Turkey's Jewish Minority vs. Turkish-Jewish Immigrants in Israel." Middle Eastern Studies 44.3 (2008): 511–525. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; However, they maintain their Turkish culture and connection to Turkey, and are strong supporters of close [[Israel–Turkey relations|relations between Israel and Turkey]].{{sfn|Toktas|2006|p=513}}

Even though historically speaking populist antisemitism was rarer in the Ottoman Empire and [[Anatolia]] than in Europe,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.americanthinker.com/2009/02/turkeys_prime_minister_leads_h.html |work=American Thinker |date=8 February 2009 |title=Turkey's Prime Minister Leads His Country Down a Destructive Path |first=Joel J. |last=Sprayregen}}&lt;/ref&gt; since the establishment of the state of Israel in 1948, there has been a rise in antisemitism. On the night of 6–7 September 1955, the [[Istanbul pogrom]] was unleashed. Although primarily aimed at the city's [[Greeks in Turkey|Greek population]], the Jewish and [[Armenians|Armenian]] communities of Istanbul were also targeted to a degree. The caused damage was mainly material - more than 4,000 shops and 1,000 houses belonging to Greeks, Armenians and Jews were destroyed - but it deeply shocked minorities throughout the country&lt;ref&gt;Dilek Güven, Nationalismus, Sozialer Wandel und Minderheiten: Die Ausschreitungen gegen die Nichtmuslime der Tuerkei (6–7 September 1955), Universitaet Bochum, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 1986, increased attacks on Jewish targets throughout Turkey impacted the security of the community, and urged many to emigrate. The Neve Shalom Synagogue in Istanbul has been attacked by [[Islamic fundamentalism|Islamic militants]] three times.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/dozens-killed-as-suicide-bombers-target-istanbul-synagogues-735840.html | work=The Independent | location=London | title=Dozens killed as suicide bombers target Istanbul synagogues | first1=James C. | last1=Helicke | date=15 November 2003 | accessdate=4 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 6 September 1986, Arab terrorists gunned down 22 Jewish worshippers and wounded 6 during ''[[Shabbat]]'' services at Neve Shalom.

===Afghanistan===
{{see also|History of the Jews in Afghanistan}}
The Afghan Jewish community declined from about 40,000 in the early 20th Century to 5,000 by 1934.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jta.org/1934/07/11/archive/trials-of-jews-in-afghanistan-bared-in-persia |title=Trials of Jews in Afghanistan Bared in Persia &amp;#124; Jewish Telegraphic Agency |publisher=Jta.org |date=11 July 1934 |accessdate=2 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1929, the Soviet press reported a pogrom in Afghanistan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jta.org/1929/05/20/archive/soviet-press-reports-anti-jewish-pogrom-occurred-in-afghanistan |title=Soviet Press Reports Anti-jewish Pogrom Occurred in Afghanistan &amp;#124; Jewish Telegraphic Agency |publisher=Jta.org |date=20 May 1929 |accessdate=2 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1933, following the assassination of [[Mohammed Nadir Shah]], King of Afghanistan, Afghan Jews were declared non-citizens&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; and many Jews in Afghanistan were expelled from their homes and robbed of their property.&lt;ref name=Roland&gt;{{cite book|author=Joan G.

From 1935 to 1941, under Prime Minister [[Mohammad Hashim Khan]] (uncle of the King) Germany was the most influential country in Afghanistan.&lt;ref&gt;Tom Lansford: "A Bitter Harvest: US Foreign Policy and Afghanistan" Ashgate 2003 page 62&lt;/ref&gt; The Nazis regarded the Afghans (like the Iranians) as Aryans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.afghanistan-analysts.org/the-hunt-for-the-holy-wheat-grail-a-not-so-botanical-expedition-in-1935/ |title=The Hunt for the Holy Wheat Grail: A not so ‘botanical’ expedition in 1935 &amp;#124; Afghanistan Analysts Network |publisher=Afghanistan-analysts.org |date=20 July 2015 |accessdate=2 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1938, it was reported that Jews were only allowed to work as shoe-polishers.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jta.org/1938/08/25/archive/all-trades-but-shoe-blacking-closed-to-afghanistan-jews |title=All Trades but Shoe-blacking Closed to Afghanistan Jews &amp;#124; Jewish Telegraphic Agency |publisher=Jta.org |date=25 August 1938 |accessdate=2 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Contact with Afghanistan was difficult at this time and with many Jews facing persecution around the world, reports reached the outside world after a delay and were rarely researched thoroughly. 
Jews were allowed to emigrate in 1951 and most moved to Israel and the United States.&lt;ref name="RFL"&gt;New York, 19 June 2007 ([[Radio Free Europe|RFE/RL]]), [http://www.rferl.org/featuresarticle/2007/6/c837c590-c06b-4c30-9017-36f29fc98437.html U.S.: Afghan Jews Keep Traditions Alive Far From Home]&lt;/ref&gt; By 1969, some 300 remained, and most of these left after the [[Soviet–Afghan War|Soviet invasion of 1979]], leaving 10 Afghan Jews in 1996, most of them in [[Kabul]]. More than 10,000 Jews of Afghan descent presently live in Israel. Over 200 families of Afghan Jews live in New York City.&lt;ref name="RFL"/&gt;

At one point it was reported that two Jews were left in Afghanistan and that they did not talk to each other.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Warren |first=Marcus |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/afghanistan/1364310/The-last-two-Jews-in-Kabul-fight-like-cat-and-dog.html |title=The last two Jews in Kabul fight like cat and dog |work=The Daily Tlegraph |date=4 December 2001 |accessdate=2 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pakistan===
{{unreferenced section|date=January 2016}}
{{see also|History of the Jews in Pakistan}}
At the time of [[Indian Independence Act 1947|Pakistani independence in 1947]], some 1,300 Jews remained in [[Karachi]], many of them [[Bene Israel]] Jews, observing [[Sephardi Jews|Sephardic]] Jewish rites. A small [[Ashkenazi]] population was also present in the city. Some Karachi streets still bear names that hark back to a time when the Jewish community was more prominent; such as Ashkenazi Street, Abraham Reuben Street (named after the former member of the Karachi Municipal Corporation), Ibn Gabirol Street, and Moses Ibn Ezra Street—although some streets have been renamed, they are still locally referred to by their original names. A small Jewish graveyard still exists in the vast [[Mewa Shah Graveyard]] near the shrine of a Sufi saint. The neighbourhood of Baghdadi in [[Lyari Town]] is named for the Baghdadi Jews who once lived there. A community of [[Bukharan Jews]] was also found in the city of [[Peshawar]], where many buildings in the old city feature a [[Star of David]] as exterior decor as a sign of the Hebrew origins of its owners. Members of the community settled in the city as merchants as early as the 17th century, although the bulk arrived as refugees fleeing the [[Russian Conquest of Bukhara|advance of the Russian Empire into Bukhara]], and later the Russian Revolution in 1917. Today, there are virtually no Jewish communities remaining in Karachi or Peshawar.

The exodus of Jews from Pakistan to [[Bombay]] and other cities in India came just prior to the creation of Israel in 1948, when anti-Israeli sentiments rose. By 1953, fewer than 500 Jews were reported to reside in all of Pakistan. Anti-Israeli sentiment and violence often flared during ensuing conflicts in the Middle East, resulting in a further movement of Jews out of Pakistan. Presently, a large number of Jews from Karachi live in the city of [[Ramla]] in Israel.

===Sudan===
{{see also|History of the Jews in Sudan}}

The Jewish community in Sudan was concentrated in the capital [[Khartoum]], and had been established in the late 19th century. By the middle of the 20th century the community included some 350 Jews, mainly of Sephardic background, who had constructed a synagogue and a Jewish school. Between 1948 and 1956, some members of the community left the country, and it finally ceased to exist by the early 1960s.&lt;ref name=cohen&gt;M. Cohen, ''Know your people, Survey of the world Jewish population''. 1962.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nakham&gt;I. Nakham, ''The notebook of the Jewish community of Sudan''.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bangladesh===
{{see also|History of the Jews in Bangladesh}}
The Jewish population in [[East Bengal]] was 200 at the time of the [[Partition of British India]] in 1947. They included a [[Baghdadi Jew]]ish merchant community that settled in [[Dhaka]] during the 17th-century. A prominent Jew in [[East Pakistan]] was Mordecai Cohen, who was a Bengali and English newsreader on East Pakistan Television. By the late 1960s, much of the Jewish community had left for [[Calcutta]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://asianjewishlife.org/pages/articles/AJL_Issue_10_Sept2012/AJL_Feature_Unknown-Jews-Bangladesh.html|title=Asian Jewish Life - Feature Issue 10 - The Unknown Jews of Bangladesh|publisher=|accessdate=13 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bechollashon.org/resources/newsletters/05-11/bangladesh-jewish-community.php|title=Be'chol Lashon: Educational Resources: Newsletters: May 2011: Bangladesh – with Jewish connections|publisher=|accessdate=13 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Table of Jewish population since 1948==
In 1948, there were between 758,000 and 881,000 Jews (see table below) living in communities throughout the Arab world. Today, there are fewer than 8,600. In some Arab states, such as Libya, which was about 3% Jewish, the Jewish community no longer exists; in other Arab countries, only a few hundred Jews remain.

==Absorption==
Of the nearly 900,000 Jewish emigrants, approximately 680,000 emigrated to Israel and 235,000 to France; the remainder went to other countries in Europe as well as to the Americas.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20120709061329/http://fr.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?pagename=JPost/JPArticle/ShowFull&amp;cid=1185379004431 Congress mulls Jewish refugee cause] by Michal Lando. ''[[The Jerusalem Post]]''. 25 July 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mfa.gov.il/MFA/Foreign+Relations/Israels+Foreign+Relations+since+1947/1947-1974/VI-+THE+ARAB+REFUGEES-+INTRODUCTION.htm Historical documents. 1947–1974 VI - The Arab refugees - introduction], MFA.gov.il&lt;/ref&gt; About two thirds of the exodus was from the North Africa region, of which Morocco's Jews went mostly to Israel, Algeria's Jews went mostly to France, and Tunisia's Jews departed for both countries.&lt;ref&gt;Jane S. Gerber, Jews of Spain: A History of the Sephardic Experience, 1994, Page 257, quote "Most of Algeria's 150,000 Jews emigrated to France, Tunisia's Jewish population of 110,000 departed for France or Israel, and Morocco's 286,000 Jews, the last community to depart, left in stages, the majority going to Israel."&lt;/ref&gt;

The majority of Jews in Arab countries eventually immigrated to the modern State of Israel.&lt;ref name=Stillmanxxi&gt;Stillman, 2003, p. xxi.&lt;/ref&gt; Hundreds of thousands of Jews were temporarily settled in the numerous [[immigrant camps (Israel)|immigrant camps]] throughout the country. Those were later transformed into [[ma'abarot]] (transit camps), where tin dwellings were provided to house up to 220,000 residents. The ma'abarot existed until 1963. The population of transition camps was gradually absorbed and integrated into Israeli society. Many of the North African and Middle-Eastern Jews had a hard time adjusting to the new dominant culture, change of lifestyle and there were claims of discrimination.{{Citation needed|reason=at least one specific example of such discrimination is needed|date=February 2014}}

===France===
France was also a major destination and about 50% (300,000 people) of modern French Jews have roots from North Africa. In total, it is estimated that between 1956 and 1967, about 235,000 North African Jews from Algeria, Tunisia and Morocco immigrated to France due to the decline of the French Empire and following the Six-Day War.&lt;ref&gt;[[Esther Benbassa]], ''The Jews of France: A History from Antiquity to the Present'', Princeton University Press, 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
The United States was a destination of many Egyptian, Lebanese and Syrian Jews.

==Views on the exodus==

===United States Congress===
In 2003, {{USBill|108|hconres|311}} was introduced into the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] by pro-Israel&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jpost.com/Features/In-Thespotlight/Ileana-Ros-Lehtinen-Ready-to-play-hardball Ileana Ros-Lehtinen: Ready to play hardball], ''[[The Jerusalem Post]]'', 23 December 2010, "I think she'll be terrific on Israel relations issues. I don't think there's anybody better," assessed [[Morris J. Amitay|Morrie Amitay]], former executive director of the American Israel Public Affairs Committee and currently the head of the staunchly pro-Israel Washington Political Action Committee. "She's 100 percent behind making Israel secure. I can't think of any issue affecting Israel in which she hasn't been on the right side," enthused Amitay, whose PAC has funded her campaigns generously over the years"&lt;/ref&gt; congresswoman [[Ileana Ros-Lehtinen]]. In 2004 [[simple resolution]]s {{USBill|108|hres|838}} and {{USBill|108|sres|325}} were issued into the House of Representatives and [[United States Senate|Senate]] by [[Jerrold Nadler]] and [[Rick Santorum]], respectively. In 2007 simple resolutions {{USBill|110|hres|185}} and {{USBill|110|sres|85}} were issued into the House of Representatives and Senate. The resolutions had been written together with lobbyist group [[Justice for Jews from Arab Countries|JJAC]],{{sfn|Fischbach|2008}} whose founder Stanley Urman described the resolution in 2009 as "perhaps our most significant accomplishment"&lt;ref&gt;Stanley Urman, [http://www.worldjewishcongress.org/uploads/materials/bff9ff349ebb4792d7948cd641952cca058c1d34.pdf "Seeking Justice for Displaced Jews"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120610042110/http://www.worldjewishcongress.org/uploads/materials/bff9ff349ebb4792d7948cd641952cca058c1d34.pdf |date=10 June 2012 }}, Justice for Jews from Arab Countries, American Sephardi Federation, [[World Jewish Congress]], transcript from Strategic Review Phase II, October 2009. Quote: "Perhaps our most significant accomplishment was the adoption in April 2008 by the United States Congress of Resolution 185, which granted the first-ever recognition of Jewish refugees from the Arab countries. This now requires US diplomats in all Middle East negotiations to refer to a quote of what the resolution calls 'multiple population of refugees' with a specific injunction that hands forth any specific reference and 'any specific reference to the Palestinian refugees must be matched by an explicit reference to Jewish refugees' ... our mandate is to follow that lead. Any explicit reference to Palestinians should be followed by explicit reference to Jewish refugees."&lt;/ref&gt; The House of Representatives resolution was sponsored by Jerrold Nadler, who followed the resolutions in 2012 with House Bill {{USBill|112|hr|6242}}. The 2007–08 resolutions proposed that any "comprehensive Middle East peace agreement to be credible and enduring, the agreement must address and resolve all outstanding issues relating to the legitimate rights of all refugees, including Jews, Christians and other populations displaced from countries in the Middle East", and encourages President [[Barack Obama]] and his administration to mention Jewish and other refugees when mentioning Palestinian refugees at international forums. The 2012 bill, which was moved to committee, proposed to recognize the plight of "850,000 Jewish refugees from Arab countries", as well as other refugees, such as Christians from the Middle East, North Africa, and the Persian Gulf.

Jerrold Nadler explained his view in 2012 that "the suffering and terrible injustices visited upon Jewish refugees in the Middle East needs to be acknowledged. It is simply wrong to recognize the rights of Palestinian refugees without recognizing the rights of nearly 1 million Jewish refugees who suffered terrible outrages at the hands of their former compatriots."&lt;ref name="HR 185 1"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.jpost.com/Jewish-World/Jewish-Features/Congress-considers-recognizing-Jewish-refugees |title=Congress considers recognizing Jewish refugees |newspaper=[[The Jerusalem Post]] |agency=JTA |date=2 August 2012 |accessdate=3 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="HR 185"&gt;{{cite news  |url=http://www.haaretz.com/jewish-world/jewish-world-news/jewish-refugees-bill-being-considered-by-u-s-house-of-representatives-1.455503 |title=Jewish refugees bill being considered by U.S. House of Representatives |work=Haaretz |agency=JTA |date=2 August 2012 |accessdate=22 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Recognition House"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4262885,00.html |title=House members seek recognition for Jewish refugees from Arab countries |publisher=Yedioth Ahronot |date=31 July 2012 |accessdate=22 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Critics have suggested the campaign is simply an anti-Palestinian "tactic",&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Refugee Repatriation: Justice, Responsibility and Redress|first=Megan|last=Bradley|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2013|isbn=9781107026315|page=91|quote="Although this is arguably not so much an attempt to secure meaningful redress for the Mizrahi as a tactic to stymie any productive discussion of the Palestinians claims, the campaign has been well-received in the United States, with resolutions on the issue introduced in the Senate and House of Representatives in February 2007."}}&lt;/ref&gt; which Michael Fischbach explains as "a tactic to help the Israeli government deflect Palestinian refugee claims in any final Israeli–Palestinian peace deal, claims that include Palestinian refugees' demand for the 'right of return' to their pre-1948 homes in Israel."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Fischbach|2008|ps=:"On 1 April 2008, the New York–based coalition Justice for Jews from Arab Countries (JJAC) announced that the U.S. House of Representatives had passed Resolution 185 (H.Res. 185), a nonbinding "sense of the House" resolution concerning the fate of 800,000 Jews who left Arab countries in the wake of the first Arab–Israeli war of 1948, some without their property. Describing these Jews as "refugees", the resolution called on the U.S. president to ensure that American representatives participating in international fora refer to the plight of Jewish refugees from Arab countries whenever mention is made of the 1948 Palestinian refugees. H.Res. 185—which JJAC helped to write—was not an effort to demand compensation for Jewish property losses in the Arab world, but rather a tactic to help the Israeli government deflect Palestinian refugee claims in any final Israeli–Palestinian peace deal, claims that include Palestinian refugees' demand for the 'right of return' to their pre-1948 homes in Israel."}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Israeli government position===
The issue of comparison of the Jewish exodus with the Palestinian exodus was raised by the Israeli Foreign Ministry as early as 1961.&lt;ref&gt;Israel Ministry for Foreign Affairs, Information Division. ''The Jewish Exodus from the Arab Countries, and the Arab Refugees''. 1961.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, a special campaign on behalf of the Jewish refugees from Arab countries was established and gained momentum. The campaign urges the creation of an international fund that would compensate both Jewish and [[Palestinian Arabs|Palestinian Arab]] refugees, and would document and research the plight of Jewish refugees from Arab countries.&lt;ref name="2012 campaign"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.timesofisrael.com/israel-urges-ban-ki-moon-to-place-plight-of-post-1948-jewish-refugees-on-un-agenda/ |title=Israel urges Ban Ki-moon to place plight of post-1948 Jewish refugees on UN agenda |publisher=The Times of Israel |date=21 September 2012 |accessdate=22 September 2012 |author=Gur, Haviv Retting}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the campaign plans to create a national day of recognition in Israel to remember the 850,000 Jewish refugees from Arab countries, as well as to build a museum that would document their history, cultural heritage, and collect their testimony.&lt;ref name="Step up"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.jpost.com/JewishWorld/JewishNews/Article.aspx?id=282835 |title=Gov't steps up campaign for Jewish Arab refugees |work=[[The Jerusalem Post]] |date=28 August 2012 |accessdate=22 September 2012 |author=Sharon, Jeremy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 21 September 2012, a special event was held at the United Nations to highlight the issue of Jewish refugees from Arab countries. Israeli ambassador [[Ron Prosor]] asked the United Nations to "establish a center of documentation and research" that would document the "850,000 untold stories" and "collect the evidence to preserve their history", which he said was ignored for too long. Israeli Deputy Foreign Minister [[Danny Ayalon]] said that "We are 64 years late, but we are not too late." Diplomats from approximately two dozen countries and organizations, including the United States, the European Union, Germany, Canada, Spain, and Hungary attended the event. In addition, Jews from Arab countries attended and spoke at the event.&lt;ref name="2012 campaign"/&gt;

===Jewish "Nakba" narrative===

====Comparison with Palestinian Naqba====
In response to the Palestinian Nakba narrative, the term "Jewish Nakba" is sometimes used to refer to the persecution and expulsion of Jews from Arab countries in the years and decades following the creation of the State of Israel. Israeli columnist [[Ben Dror Yemini]], himself a Mizrahi Jew, wrote:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Ben |last=Dror Yemini |title=The Jewish Nakba: Expulsions, Massacres and Forced Conversions |url=http://www.nrg.co.il/online/1/ART1/891/209.html |work=Maariv |date=16 May 2009 |accessdate=23 June 2009 |language=Hebrew}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|However, there is another Nakba: the Jewish Nakba. During those same years [the 1940s], there was a long line of slaughters, of pogroms, of property confiscation and of deportations against Jews in Islamic countries. This chapter of history has been left in the shadows. The Jewish Nakba was worse than the Palestinian Nakba. The only difference is that the Jews did not turn that Nakba into their founding ethos. To the contrary.}}

Professor [[Ada Aharoni]], chairman of The World Congress of the Jews from Egypt, argues in an article entitled "What about the Jewish Nakba?" that exposing the truth about the expulsion of the Jews from Arab states could facilitate a genuine peace process, since it would enable Palestinians to realize they were not the only ones who suffered, and thus their sense of "victimization and rejectionism" will decline.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Ada|last=Aharoni |title=What about Jewish Nakba? |url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3743829,00.html |work=YnetNews |date=10 July 2009 |accessdate=10 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, Canadian MP and international human rights lawyer [[Irwin Cotler]] has referred to the "double Nakba". He criticizes the Arab states' rejectionism of the Jewish state, their subsequent invasion to destroy the newly formed nation, and the punishment meted out against their local Jewish populations:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Irwin |last=Cotler |title=The double Nakba |work=[[The Jerusalem Post]] |date=30 June 2008 |accessdate=22 May 2011 |url=http://www.jpost.com/Opinion/Op-EdContributors/Article.aspx?id=106021}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|The result was, therefore, a double Nakba: not only of Palestinian-Arab suffering and the creation of a Palestinian refugee problem, but also, with the assault on Israel and on Jews in Arab countries, the creation of a second, much less known, group of refugees—Jewish refugees from Arab countries.}}

====Criticism of Jewish Naqba narrative in Israel====
Iraqi-born [[Ran Cohen]], a former member of the [[Knesset]], said: "I have this to say: I am not a refugee. I came at the behest of Zionism, due to the pull that this land exerts, and due to the idea of redemption. Nobody is going to define me as a refugee." Yemeni-born [[Yisrael Yeshayahu]], former Knesset speaker, Labor Party, stated: "We are not refugees. [Some of us] came to this country before the state was born. We had messianic aspirations." And Iraqi-born [[Shlomo Hillel]], also a former speaker of the Knesset, Labor Party, claimed: "I do not regard the departure of Jews from Arab lands as that of refugees. They came here because they wanted to, as Zionists."&lt;ref name=Shenhav2/&gt;

Historian [[Tom Segev]] stated: "Deciding to emigrate to Israel was often a very personal decision. It was based on the particular circumstances of the individual's life. They were not all poor, or 'dwellers in dark caves and smoking pits'. Nor were they always subject to persecution, repression or discrimination in their native lands. They emigrated for a variety of reasons, depending on the country, the time, the community, and the person."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.palestinechronicle.com/view_article_details.php?id=15627 "Arab Jews and Myths of Expulsion and Exchange"] The Palestine Chronicles.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|date=November 2010}}

Iraqi-born Israeli historian [[Avi Shlaim]], speaking of the wave of Iraqi Jewish migration to Israel, concludes that, even though Iraqi Jews were "victims of the Israeli-Arab conflict", Iraqi Jews aren't refugees, saying "nobody expelled us from Iraq, nobody told us that we were unwanted."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Meron Rapoport |url=http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/611505.html |title=No peaceful solution |newspaper=[[Haaretz]] |date=11 August 2005 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050814015754/http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/611505.html |archivedate=14 August 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; He restated that case in a review of [[Martin Gilbert]]'s book, ''In Ishmael's House''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/2/8ae6559c-b169-11df-b899-00144feabdc0.html#axzz1u5I93QVU "In Ishmael's house"] ''[[Financial Times]]''. 30 August 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Yehuda Shenhav]] has criticized the analogy between Jewish emigration from Arab countries and the Palestinian exodus. He also says "The unfounded, immoral analogy between Palestinian refugees and Mizrahi immigrants needlessly embroils members of these two groups in a dispute, degrades the dignity of many Mizrahi Jews, and harms prospects for genuine Jewish-Arab reconciliation." He has stated that "the campaign's proponents hope their efforts will prevent conferral of what is called a 'right of return' on Palestinians, and reduce the size of the compensation Israel is liable to be asked to pay in exchange for Palestinian property appropriated by the state guardian of 'lost' assets."&lt;ref name=Shenhav2/&gt;

Israeli historian [[Yehoshua Porath]] has rejected the comparison, arguing that while there is a superficial similarity, the ideological and historical significance of the two population movements are entirely different. Porath points out that the immigration of Jews from Arab countries to Israel, expelled or not, was the "fulfilment of a national dream". He also argues that the achievement of this Zionist goal was only made possible through the endeavors of the Jewish Agency's agents, teachers, and instructors working in various Arab countries since the 1930s. Porath contrasts this with the Palestinian Arabs' flight of 1948 as completely different. He describes the outcome of the Palestinian's flight as an "unwanted national calamity" that was accompanied by "unending personal tragedies". The result was "the collapse of the Palestinian community, the fragmentation of a people, and the loss of a country that had in the past been mostly Arabic-speaking and Islamic. "&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Yehoshua|last=Porath |title=Mrs. Peters's Palestine |url=http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/1986/jan/16/mrs-peterss-palestine/?pagination=false |work= ''The New York Review of Books |date=16 January 1986 |accessdate=19 February 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alon Liel, a former director-general of the Foreign Ministry says that many Jews escaped from Arab countries, but he does not call them "Refugees" since his definition for the term "Refugee" is different from [[UNWRA]]'s [[Palestinian refugee#UNRWA|definition]].&lt;ref name=TOI/&gt;

====Criticism of Jewish Naqba narrative by Palestinians====
On 21 September 2012, at a [[United Nations]] conference, the issue of Jewish refugees from Arab countries was criticized by [[Hamas]] spokesman, Sami Abu Zuhri, who stated that the Jewish refugees from Arab countries were in fact responsible for the Palestinian displacement and that "those Jews are criminals rather than refugees."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.jpost.com/MiddleEast/Article.aspx?id=285923 | title=Hamas: Arab Jews are not refugees, but criminals | publisher=Jerusalem Post | accessdate=23 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In regard to the same conference, Palestinian politician [[Hanan Ashrawi]] has argued that Jews from Arab lands are not refugees at all and that Israel is using their claims in order to counterbalance to those of Palestinian refugees against it.&lt;ref name=jpost2012&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.jpost.com/Middle-East/Hamas-Arab-Jews-are-not-refugees-but-criminals |title=Hamas: 'Arab Jews' are not refugees, but criminals |work=[[The Jerusalem Post]] |date=23 September 2012 |accessdate=26 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ashrawi said that "If Israel is their homeland, then they are not 'refugees'; they are emigrants who returned either voluntarily or due to a political decision."&lt;ref name=jpost2012/&gt;

==Property losses and compensation==
In Libya, Iraq and Egypt many Jews lost vast portions of their wealth and property as part of the exodus because of severe restrictions on moving their wealth out of the country.

In the North Africa, the situation was more complex. For example, in Morocco emigrants were not allowed to take more than $60 worth of Moroccan currency with them, although generally they were able to sell their property prior to leaving,{{sfn|Fischbach|2008|p=94}} and some were able to work around the currency restrictions by exchanging cash into jewelry or other portable valuables.{{sfn|Fischbach|2008|p=94}} This led some scholars to speculate the North African Jewish population, comprising two thirds of the exodus, on the whole did not suffer large property losses.{{sfn|Fischbach|2008|p=88|ps=: "[In] the Maghrib countries of Tunisia, Morocco, and Algeria, Jews largely did not suffer large-scale property losses upon emigration.... Because proper dispossession largely was not a problem for Jewish emigrants from the Maghrib, it is difficult to find much information about Jewish property there."}} However, opinions on this differ.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}}

Yemeni Jews were usually able to sell what property they possessed prior to departure, although not always at market rates.{{sfn|Fischbach|2008|p=49|quote=: "In fact, by and large, property dispossession did not feature into the saga of the Jewish exodus from Yemen. Yemeni Jewish emigrants usually sold what property they possessed prior to departure, although not always at market rates. others were so poor as to own practically nothing to begin with."}}

===Estimated value===
Various estimates of the value of property abandoned by the Jewish exodus have been published, with wide variety in the quoted figures from a few billion dollars to hundreds of billions.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Hirschberg, Private Property Keep Out!, Jerusalem Report 10th Anniversary, ''[[The Jerusalem Post]]'', September 1999, "In 1945 there were 870,000 Jews living in the Middle East and North Africa. By 1952, hundreds of thousands had arrived in Israel, and tens of thousands had reached Western Europe and North and South America. Estimates on the collective value of the property they left behind vary wildly - from a few billion dollars to more than $100 billion."&lt;/ref&gt;

The World Organization of Jews from Arab Countries (WOJAC) estimated in 2006, that Jewish property abandoned in Arab countries would be valued at more than $100 billion, later revising their estimate in 2007 to $300 billion. They also estimated Jewish-owned real-estate left behind in Arab lands at 100,000 square kilometers (four times the size of the state of Israel).&lt;ref name=Schwartz/&gt;&lt;ref name=abc&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jcpa.org/JCPA/Templates/ShowPage.asp?DBID=1&amp;TMID=111&amp;LNGID=1&amp;FID=388&amp;PID=0&amp;IID=2196|title=The Palestinian Refugee Issue: Rhetoric vs. Reality by Sidney Zabludoff|work=Jerusalem Center For Public Affairs|accessdate=13 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=abc /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.jpost.com/Home/Article.aspx?id=38842 |title=Jews forced out of Arab countries seek reparations |publisher=www.jpost.com |accessdate=16 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ejhdoal&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.jpost.com/JewishWorld/JewishNews/Article.aspx?id=82191 |title=Expelled Jews hold deeds on abandoned property in Arab lands |publisher=www.jpost.com |accessdate=16 January 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The type and extent of linkage between the Jewish exodus from Arab countries and the 1948 Palestinian exodus has also been the source of controversy. Advocacy groups have suggested that there are strong ties between the two processes and some of them even claim that decoupling the two issues is unjust.&lt;ref name=Mendes&gt;Mendes, Philip. [http://mefacts.org/cached.asp?x_id=10985 The forgotten refugees: the causes of the post-1948 Jewish Exodus from Arab Countries] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20130113093432/http://mefacts.org/cached.asp?x_id=10985 |date=13 January 2013 }}, Presented at the 14 Jewish Studies Conference Melbourne March 2002. Retrieved 12 June 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/jun/25/middleeast.middleeastthemedia|title=Lyn Julius: Recognising the plight of Jewish refugees from Arab countries |work=The Guardian |location=London |date=25 June 2008 |accessdate=6 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/jun/23/israelandthepalestinians.middleeast "A different kind of catastrophe"] ''The Guardian'', 23 June 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Holocaust restitution]] expert Sidney Zabludoff, writing for the Israeli-advocacy group [[Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs]], suggests that the losses sustained by the Jews who fled Arab countries since 1947 amounts to $700m at period prices based on an estimated per capita wealth of $700 multiplied by one million refugees, equating to $6 billion today, assuming that the entire exodus left all of their wealth behind.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.jcpa.org/JCPA/Templates/ShowPage.asp?DBID=1&amp;TMID=111&amp;LNGID=1&amp;FID=388&amp;PID=0&amp;IID=2196 The Palestinian Refugee Issue: Rhetoric vs. Reality]", Sidney Zabludoff, ''Jewish Political Studies Review'' 20:1–2 (Spring 2008)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Israeli position===
The official position of the Israeli government is that Jews from Arab countries are considered refugees, and it considers their rights to property left in countries of origin as valid and existent.&lt;ref name=MOJ&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.justice.gov.il/MOJEng/Rights+of+Jews+from+Arab+Lands/|title=Rights of Jews from Arab Lands}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, the [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox]] Sephardi party, [[Shas]], announced its intention to seek compensation for Jewish refugees from Arab states.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.haaretz.com/print-edition/news/shas-to-seek-payout-for-jews-deported-from-arab-countries-1.258142|title=Shas to seek payout for Jews deported from Arab countries}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, Israeli lawmakers introduced a bill into the Knesset to make compensation for Jews from Arab and Muslim countries an integral part of any future peace negotiations by requiring compensation on behalf of current Jewish Israeli citizens, who were expelled from Arab countries after Israel was established in 1948 and leaving behind a significant amount of valuable property. In February 2010, the bill passed its first reading. The bill was sponsored by MK [[Nissim Ze'ev]] (Shas) and follows a resolution passed in the United States House of Representatives in 2008, calling for refugee recognition to be extended to Jews and Christians similar to that extended to Palestinians in the course of Middle East peace talks.&lt;ref&gt;Kliger, Rachelle [http://www.jpost.com/JewishWorld/JewishNews/Article.aspx?id=169043 Israel vies to bring Mideast Jewish refugees into talks] (18 February 2010) in ''[[The Jerusalem Post]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;ref name=MG202&gt;{{harvnb| Meir-Glitzenstein|2004|p=202}}: "For the first few weeks after the enactment of the law, the Zionist activists forbade registration; they were waiting for a clarification of the aliyah routes and a decision by the Israeli government as to its willingness to take in the Jews of Iraq. This ban heightened the tension in the Jewish community. On 8 April 1950, the Zionist leadership (that is, the leaders of Hehalutz and the Haganah, along with the emissaries) convened and discussed the registration issue in view of the pressure from huge numbers of people who wanted to sign up. At the end of the meeting the leadership decided to instruct the people to register and not to wait for instructions from Tel Aviv. A bomb had blown up that day in a Jewish cafe, wounding four people, and the two events were presumably related.... The activists' faith in the Zionist ideal and their zeal to implement it, combined with their confidence that Israel would not ignore the aliyah needs of Iraqi Jewry, paved the way to this decision. To inform the Jews of the decision, the leadership issued a proclamation.... The fact that the proclamation was written in the name of the State of Israel lent it added force and gave the Jews the impression that the State of Israel and the Israeli government were calling on them to leave Iraq and move to Israel."&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;ref name=MG204&gt;{{harvnb | Meir-Glitzenstein|2004|p=204}}: "As stated above, this situation was a consequence of the Israeli immigration and absorption policy. Throughout this period, Israel refused to instruct its emissaries in Baghdad to limit registration for emigration and instead expressed willingness to take in all Iraqi Jews who wished to leave. But immigrants were also flooding into Israel at the time from Poland and especially from Romania, where the exit gates had unexpectedly been re-opened, and Israel was unwilling to limit aliyah from there either. Israel could not afford the initial absorption of such large numbers of immigrants and therefore set quotas based on priorities. And Poland and Romania were given priority over Iraq.... The reason given for according priority to immigration from eastern Europe was concern that the communist regimes there would close their gates and put an end to the exodus.... Ben-Gurion maintained that the Iraqi leaders were determined to get rid of the Jews who had signed up to emigrate and assumed that delaying their departure would not put an end to the process. In contrast, he was afraid that aliyah from Romania would be terminated suddenly by an order from high up, and aliyah from Poland was expected to stop at the beginning of 1951."&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;ref name=MG203&gt;{{harvnb | Meir-Glitzenstein|2004|p=203}}: "The change began as a result of the immigration policy of the Israeli government: the pace of aliyah lagged far behind registration and revocation of the registrants' citizenship.&lt;br&gt;By September 1950, only 10,000 Jews had left; 60,000 of the 70,000 registrants were still in Iraq. The problem grew worse. By mid-November only 18,000 of 83,000 registrants had left. Matters had not improved by early January 1951: the number of registrants was up to 86,000, only about 23,000 of whom had left. More than 60,000 Jews were still waiting to leave! According to the law, Jews who had lost their citizenship had to leave Iraq within 15 days. Although in theory, only 12,000 Jews still in Iraq had completed the registration process and had their citizenship revoked, the position of the others was not very different: the Iraqi government was in no hurry to revoke their citizenship only because the rate of departure was already lagging behind the revocation of citizenship, and it did not want to exacerbate the problem.&lt;br&gt;Meanwhile, thousands of Jews had been fired from their jobs, had sold their property, and were waiting for Israeli aircraft, using up their meagre funds in the meantime. The thousands of poor Jews who had left or been expelled from the peripheral cities, and who had gone to Baghdad to wait for their opportunity to emigrate, were in an especially bad state. They were housed in public buildings and were being supported by the Jewish community. The situation was intolerable."&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;ref name=MG205&gt;{{harvnb| Meir-Glitzenstein|2004|p=205}}: "But soon the delay in evacuating the Jews became the problem of the Iraqi state and not just that of the would-be emigrants and the emissaries. The condition of the Jews had ramifications for the overall political situation, domestic security and the Iraqi economy. The Iraqi government found that the problems of instability and turmoil not only remained unsolved but had become worse. Particularly infuriating was the awareness that the source of the problem was the Israeli government, which held the key to the volume and rate of departure of Iraqi Jewry.&lt;br&gt;These developments changed Iraq's attitude towards the Jews. From now on Iraq sought to get rid of everyone who had registered immediately and at almost any price. This policy was exacerbated when, in mid-September 1950, Nuri al-Said replaced Tawfiq aI-Suwaydi, who had initiated the Denaturalization Law, as prime minister. Nuri was determined to drive the Jews out of his country as quickly as possible, and when he discovered that Israel was unwilling to increase immigration quotas he suggested various ideas for expelling the Jews."&lt;/ref&gt;

It arose from a decision of the Iraqi government to retaliate for the expulsion of Arab refugees from Palestine by forcing the majority of the Jewish community of Iraq to go to Israel. Nuri Said, the Prime Minister of Iraq, who was on a visit to Amman, came out with the astounding proposition that a convoy of Iraqi Jews should be brought over in army lorries escorted by armed cars, taken to the Jordanian-Israeli frontier and forced to cross the line. Quite apart from the certainty that the Israelis would not consent to receive the deportees in that manner, the passage of the Jews through Jordan would almost certainly have touched off serious trouble among the very disgruntled Arab refugees who were crowded into the country. Either the Iraqi Jews would have been massacred or their Iraqi guards would have had to shoot other Arabs to protect the lives of their charges. The devious method employed by Nuri Said to make the suggestion was, in itself, enough to upset the King and the cabinet, who still resented the way in which they had been left In the lurch by the Iraqi Government in the Armistice negotiations. Nuri first telephoned me asking to be received at my house with [[Samir al-Rifai|Samir Rifa'i]] to discuss an important question about Palestine. I agreed to the meeting on the natural assumption that Samlr already knew all about it. Nuri then spoke to Samlr and told him that I wanted to see both of them at my house. The latter assumed that the initiative came from myself. When we got together and Nuri made his proposal, and added the equally surprising statement that he would be responsible for the consequences, Samir and I were flabbergasted and our faces must have shown our feelings. Both of us were vexed at having been tricked into a false position. I replied at once that the matter at issue was no concern of His Majesty's Government. Samlr refused his assent as politely as possible, but Nuri lost his temper at being rebuffed and he said: 'So. you do not want to do It, do you?' Samlr snapped back, 'Of course I do not want to be party to such a crime', Nuri thereupon exploded with rage and I began to wonder what the head of the diplomatic mlsslon would do if two Prime Ministers came to blows in his study. We then broke up in disorder, but I got them out of the house while preserving a minimum of propriety.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Labeling theory''' is the theory of how the [[self-identity]] and behavior of individuals may be determined or influenced by the terms used to describe or classify them.  It is associated with the concepts of [[self-fulfilling prophecy]] and [[stereotype|stereotyping]]. Labeling theory holds that [[deviance (sociology)|deviance]] is not inherent to an act, but instead focuses on the tendency of majorities to negatively label minorities or those seen as deviant from standard [[cultural norm]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Labeling theory: Social constructionism, Social stigma, Deinstitutionalisation, George Herbert Mead, Howard S. Becker, Labelling&lt;/ref&gt; The theory was prominent during the 1960s and 1970s, and some modified versions of the theory have developed and are still currently popular. A stigma is defined as a powerfully negative label that changes a person's self-concept and [[social identity]].&lt;ref name="Macionis"&gt;{{harvp|Macionis|Gerber|2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Labeling theory is closely related to [[social constructionism|social-construction]] and [[symbolic interactionism|symbolic-interaction]] analysis.&lt;ref name="Macionis"/&gt;  Labeling theory was developed by [[sociologist]]s during the 1960s. [[Howard S. Becker|Howard Saul Becker's]] book ''Outsiders'' was extremely influential in the development of this theory and its rise to popularity.

==Theoretical basis==
Labeling theory had its origins in ''[[Suicide (book)|Suicide]]'', a book by French sociologist [[Émile Durkheim]]. He found that crime is not so much a violation of a penal code as it is an act that outrages society. He was the first to suggest that deviant labeling satisfies that function and satisfies society's need to control the behavior.

As a contributor to [[American Pragmatism]] and later a member of the [[Chicago school (sociology)|Chicago School]], [[George Herbert Mead]] posited that the self is socially constructed and reconstructed through the interactions which each person has with the [[community]]. The labeling theory suggests that people obtain labels from how others view their tendencies or behaviors. Each individual is aware of how they are judged by others because he or she has attempted many different roles and functions in social interactions and has been able to gauge the reactions of those present.

This theoretically builds a subjective conception of the self, but as others intrude into the reality of that individual's life, this represents objective data which may require a re-evaluation of that conception depending on the authoritativeness of the others' judgment. [[Family]] and [[friend]]s may judge differently from random strangers. More socially representative individuals such as [[police officer]]s or [[judge]]s may be able to make more globally respected judgments. If deviance is a failure to conform to the rules observed by most of the group, the reaction of the group is to label the person as having offended against their social or moral norms of behavior. This is the power of the group: to designate breaches of their rules as deviant and to treat the person differently depending on the seriousness of the breach. The more differential the treatment, the more the individual's [[self-image]] is affected.

Labeling theory concerns itself mostly not with the normal roles that define our lives, but with those very special roles that society provides for [[social deviance|deviant behavior]], called deviant roles, stigmatic roles, or [[social stigma]]. A social role is a set of expectations we have about a behavior. Social roles are necessary for the organization and functioning of any society or group. We expect the postman, for example, to adhere to certain fixed rules about how he does his job. "Deviance" for a sociologist does not mean morally wrong, but rather behavior that is condemned by society. Deviant behavior can include both criminal and non-criminal activities.

Investigators found that deviant roles powerfully affect how we perceive those who are assigned those roles. They also affect how the deviant actor perceives himself and his relationship to society. The deviant roles and the labels attached to them function as a form of social stigma. Always inherent in the deviant role is the attribution of some form of "pollution" or difference that marks the labeled person as different from others. Society uses these stigmatic roles to them to control and limit deviant behavior: "If you proceed in this behavior, you will become a member of that group of people."

Whether a breach of a given rule will be stigmatized will depend on the significance of the [[morality|moral]] or other tenet it represents. For example, [[adultery]] may be considered a breach of an informal rule or it may be [[criminalize]]d depending on the status of [[marriage]], morality, and [[religion]] within the community. In most Western countries, adultery is not a crime. Attaching the label "adulterer" may have some unfortunate consequences but they are not generally severe. But in some Islamic countries, [[zina (Arabic)|zina]] is a crime and proof of extramarital activity may lead to severe consequences for all concerned.

Stigma is usually the result of laws enacted against the behavior. Laws protecting slavery or outlawing homosexuality, for instance, will over time form deviant roles connected with those behaviors. Those who are assigned those roles will be seen as less human and reliable. Deviant roles are the sources of negative [[stereotype]]s, which tend to support society's disapproval of the behavior.

One of the founders of social [[interactionism]], [[George Herbert Mead]] focused on the internal processes of how the mind constructs one's self-image. In ''Mind, Self, and Society'' (1934),&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Mead|1934}}&lt;/ref&gt; he showed how infants come to know ''persons'' first and only later come to know ''things''. According to Mead, thought is both a ''social'' and ''[[pragmaticism|pragmatic]]'' process, based on the model of two persons discussing how to solve a problem. Mead's central concept is the self, the part of an individual's personality composed of self-awareness and self-image.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Macionis|2012|p=107}}&lt;/ref&gt; Our self-image is, in fact, constructed of ideas about what we think others are thinking about us. While we make fun of those who visibly talk to themselves, they have only failed to do what the rest of us do in keeping the internal conversation to ourselves. Human behavior, Mead stated, is the result of meanings created by the social interaction of conversation, both real and imaginary.

===Thomas Scheff===
[[Thomas J. Scheff]], Professor, Emeritus, Dept of Sociology, UCSB, published the book Being Mentally III: A Sociological Theory (1966).
According to Scheff society has perceptions about people with mental illness. He stated that everyone in the society learns the stereotyped imagery of mental disorder through ordinary social interaction. From childhood, people learn to use terms like “crazy”, “loony”, “nuts” and associated them with them with disturbed behaviors. The media also contributes to this bias against mentally ill patients by associating them with violent crimes. Scheff believes that mental illness is a label given to a person who has a behavior which is away from the social norms of the society and is treated as a social deviance in the society. Once a person is given a label of “mentally ill person”, s/he receives a set of uniform responses from the society, which are generally negative in nature. These responses from the society compel to the person to take the role of a “mentally ill person” as s/he starts internalizing the same. When the individual takes on the role of being mentally ill as her/his central identity, s/he becomes a stable mental ill person. Chronic mental illness is thus a social role and the societal reaction is the most determinant of one’s entry into this role of chronically ill. 
According to Scheff hospitalization of a mentally ill person further reinforces this social role and forces her/him to take this role as her/his self-perception. Once the person is institutionalized for mental disorder, s/he has been publicly labeled as “crazy” and forced to become a member of a deviant social group. It then becomes difficult for a deviant person to return to her/his former level of functioning as the status of ‘patient’ causes unfavorable evaluations by self and by others.

===Frank Tannenbaum===
[[Frank Tannenbaum]] is considered the grandfather of labeling theory. His ''Crime and Community'' (1938),&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Tannenbaum|1938}}&lt;/ref&gt; describing the social interaction involved in crime, is considered a pivotal foundation of modern criminology. While the criminal differs little or not at all from others in the original impulse to first commit a crime, social interaction accounts for continued acts that develop a pattern of interest to sociologists.

Tannenbaum first introduced the idea of 'tagging'.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|O'Grady|2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; While conducting his studies with delinquent youth, he found that a negative tag or label often contributed to further involvement in delinquent activities. This initial tagging may cause the individual to adopt it as part of their identity. The crux of Tannenbaum's argument is that the greater the attention placed on this label, the more likely the person is to identify themselves as the label.

Kerry Townsend writes about the revolution in criminology caused by Tannenbaum's work:

:"The roots of Frank Tannenbaum's theoretical model, known as the "dramatization of evil" or labeling theory, surfaces in the mid- to late-thirties. At this time, the 'New Deal' legislation had not defeated the woes of the Great Depression, and, although dwindling, immigration into the United States continued.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Sumner|1994}}&lt;/ref&gt; The social climate was one of disillusionment with the government. The class structure was one of cultural isolationism; cultural relativity had not yet taken hold. 'The persistence of the class structure, despite the welfare reforms and controls over big business, was unmistakable.'&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Sumner|1994|p=117}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Positivist School of Criminological thought was still dominant, and in many states, the sterilization movement was underway. The emphasis on biological determinism and internal explanations of crime were the preeminent force in the theories of the early thirties. This dominance by the Positivist School changed in the late thirties with the introduction of conflict and social explanations of crime and criminality...

:"One of the central tenets of the theory is to encourage the end of labeling process. In the words of Frank Tannenbaum, "the way out is through a refusal to dramatize the evil", the justice system attempts to do this through diversion programs. The growth of the theory and its current application, both practical and theoretical, provide a solid foundation for continued popularity.":&lt;ref&gt;Townsend, F. ''Frank Tannenbaum: The Dramatization of Evil''. {{cite web |url=http://www.criminology.fsu.edu/crimtheory/tannenbaum.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-05-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090426080156/http://www.criminology.fsu.edu/crimtheory/tannenbaum.htm |archivedate=2009-04-26 |df= }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Edwin Lemert===
It was sociologist [[Edwin Lemert]] (1951) who introduced the concept of "[[secondary deviance]]". The primary deviance is the experience connected to the overt behavior, say drug addiction and its practical demands and consequences. Secondary deviation is the role created to deal with society's condemnation of the behavior of a person.

With other sociologists of his time, Lemert saw how all deviant acts are social acts, a result of the cooperation of society. In studying drug addiction, Lemert observed a very powerful and subtle force at work. Besides the physical addiction to the drug and all the economic and social disruptions it caused, there was an intensely intellectual process at work concerning one's own identity and the justification for the behavior: "I do these things because I am this way."

There might be certain subjective and personal motives that might first lead a person to drink or shoplift. But the activity itself tells us little about the person's self-image or its relationship to the activity. Lemert writes: "His acts are repeated and organized subjectively and transformed into active roles and become the social criteria for assigning status.....When a person begins to employ his deviant behavior or a role based on it as a means of defense, attack, or adjustment to the overt and covert problems created by the consequent societal reaction to him, his deviation is secondary".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Lemert|1951|pp=75–76}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Howard Becker===
While it was Lemert who introduced the key concepts of labeling theory, it was [[Howard S. Becker|Howard Becker]] who became their successor. He first began describing the process of how a person adopts a deviant role in a study of dance musicians, with whom he once worked. He later studied the identity formation of marijuana smokers. This study was the basis of his ''Outsiders'' published in 1963. This work became the manifesto of the labeling theory movement among sociologists. In his opening, Becker writes:

:"...''social groups create deviance by making rules whose infraction creates deviance'', and by applying those rules to particular people and labeling them as outsiders. From this point of view, deviance is ''not'' a quality of the act the person commits, but rather a consequence of the application by other of rules and sanctions to an 'offender.' The deviant is one to whom that label has been successfully applied; deviant behavior is behavior that people so label."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Becker|1973|p=9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While society uses the stigmatic label to justify its condemnation, the deviant actor uses it to justify his actions. He wrote: "To put a complex argument in a few words: instead of the deviant motives leading to the deviant behavior, it is the other way around, the deviant behavior in time produces the deviant motivation."&lt;ref name="Becker_26"&gt;{{harvp|Becker|1973|p=26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Becker's immensely popular views were also subjected to a barrage of criticism, most of it blaming him for neglecting the influence of other biological, genetic effects and personal responsibility. In a later 1973 edition of his work, he answered his critics. He wrote that sociologists, while dedicated to studying society, are often careful not to look too closely. Instead, he wrote: "I prefer to think of what we study as ''collective action.'' People act, as Mead and Blumer have made clearest, ''together''. They do what they do with an eye on what others have done, are doing now, and may do in the future. One tries to fit his own line of action into the actions of others, just as each of them likewise adjusts his own developing actions to what he sees and expects others to do."&lt;ref name="Becker_26"/&gt;

Francis Cullen reported in 1984 that Becker was probably too generous with his critics. After 20 years, his views, far from being supplanted, have been corrected and absorbed into an expanded "structuring perspective".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Cullen|1984|p=130}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Albert Memmi===
In ''The Colonizer and the Colonized'' (1965) [[Albert Memmi]] described the deep psychological effects of the social stigma created by the domination of one group by another. He wrote:

:"The longer the oppression lasts, the more profoundly it affects him (the oppressed). It ends by becoming so familiar to him that he believes it is part of his own constitution, that he accepts it and could not imagine his recovery from it. This acceptance is the crowning point of oppression."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Memmi|1965|pp=321–322}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Dominated Man'' (1968), Memmi turned his attention to the motivation of stigmatic labeling: it justifies the exploitation or criminalization of the victim. He wrote:

:"Why does the accuser feel obliged to accuse in order to justify himself? ''Because he feels guilty toward his victim.'' Because he feels that his attitude and his behavior are essentially unjust and fraudulent....Proof? ''In almost every case, the punishment has already been inflicted''. The victim of racism is already living under the weight of disgrace and oppression.... In order to justify such punishment and misfortune, a process of rationalization is set in motion, by which to explain the ghetto and colonial exploitation."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Memmi|1968|pp=191–193}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Central to stigmatic labeling is the attribution of an inherent fault: It is as if one says, "There must be something wrong with these people. Otherwise, why would we treat them so badly?"

===Erving Goffman===
Perhaps the most important contributor to labeling theory was [[Erving Goffman]], President of the American Sociological Association, and one of America's most cited sociologists. His most popular books include ''[[The Presentation of Self in Everyday Life]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Goffman|1959}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Interaction Ritual'',&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Goffman|1982}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Frame Analysis''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Goffman|1974}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His most important contribution to labeling theory, however, was ''Stigma: Notes on the Management of Spoiled Identity'' published in 1963.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Goffman|1963}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike other authors who examined the process of adopting a deviant identity, Goffman explored the ways people managed that identity and controlled information about it.

Among Goffman's key insights were the following:
* The modern nation state's heightened demand for normalcy. Today's stigmas are the result not so much of ancient or religious prohibitions, but of a new demand for normalcy. He wrote: "The notion of the 'normal human being' may have its source in the medical approach to humanity, or in the tendency of large-scale bureaucratic organizations such as the nation state, to treat all members in some respects as equal. Whatever its origins, it seems to provide the basic imagery through which laymen currently conceive themselves.''&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Goffman|1963|p=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Living in a divided world. Deviants divide their worlds into 1. forbidden places where discovery means exposure and danger, 2. places where people of that kind are painfully tolerated, and 3. places where one's kind is exposed without need to dissimulate or conceal.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Goffman|1963|p=81}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Dealing with others is fraught with great complexity and ambiguity. He wrote: "When normals and stigmatized do in fact enter one another's immediate presence, especially when they attempt to maintain a joint conversational encounter, there occurs one of the primal scenes of sociology; for, in many cases, these moments will be the ones when the causes and effects of stigma will be directly confronted by both sides....&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Goffman|1963|p=13}}&lt;/ref&gt; "What are unthinking routines for normals can become management problems for the discreditable....The person with a secret failing, then, must be alive to the social situation as a scanner of possibilities, and is therefore likely to be alienated from the simpler world in which those around them apparently dwell."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Goffman|1963|p=88}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Society's demands are filled with contradictions. On the one hand, a stigmatized person may be told that he is no different from others. On the other hand, he must declare his status as "a resident alien who stands for his group."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Goffman|1963|p=108}}&lt;/ref&gt; "It requires that the stigmatized individual cheerfully and unselfconsciously accept himself as essentially the same as normals, while at the same time he voluntarily withholds himself from those situations in which normals would find it difficult to give lip service to their similar acceptance of him..." One has to convey the impression that the burden of the stigma is not too heavy yet keep himself at the required distance. "A ''phantom acceptance'' is allowed to provide the base for a ''phantom normalcy."''&lt;ref name="harvp|Goffman|1963|p=122"&gt;{{harvp|Goffman|1963|p=122}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Familiarity need not reduce contempt. In spite of the common belief that openness and exposure will decrease stereotypes and repression, the opposite is true. "Thus, whether we interact with strangers or intimates, we will still find that the fingertips of society have reached bluntly into the contact, even here putting us in our place."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Goffman|1963|p=53}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===David Matza===
In ''On Becoming Deviant'' (1969),&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Matza|1969}}&lt;/ref&gt; sociologist David Matza gives the most vivid and graphic account of the process of adopting a deviant role. The acts of authorities in outlawing a proscribed behavior can have two effects, keeping most out of the behavior, but also offering new opportunities for creating deviant identities. He says the concept of "affinity" does little to explain the dedication to the behavior. "Instead, it may be regarded as a natural biographical tendency born of personal and social circumstances that suggests but hardly compels a direction or movement."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Matza|1969|p=93}}&lt;/ref&gt; What gives force to that movement is the development of a new identity. He writes:

:"To be cast as a thief, as a prostitute, or more generally, a deviant, is to further compound and hasten the process of becoming that very thing...."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Matza|1969|p=157}}&lt;/ref&gt; In shocked discovery, the subject now concretely understands that there are serious people who really go around building their lives around his activities--stopping him, correcting him, devoted to him. They keep records on the course of his life, even develop theories on how he got that way.... Pressed by such a display, the subject may begin to add meaning and gravity to his deviant activities. But he may do so in a way not especially intended by agents of the state...."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Matza|1969|pp=163–164}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:"The meaningful issue of identity is whether this activity, or any of my activities can stand for me, or be regarded as proper indications of my being. I have done a theft, been signified a thief. ''am'' I a thief? To answer affirmatively, we must be able to conceive a special relationship between being and doing--a unity capable of being indicated. That building of meaning has a notable quality."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Matza|1969|pp=165–170}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The "criminal" ==
{{Criminology and penology |theory}}

As an application of [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]], the theory hypothesizes that the labels applied to individuals influence their behavior, particularly the application of negative or stigmatizing labels (such as "[[criminal]]" or "[[Felony|felon]]") promote [[Deviance (sociology)|deviant behavior]], becoming a [[self-fulfilling prophecy]], i.e. an individual who is labeled has little choice but to conform to the essential meaning of that judgment. Consequently, labeling theory postulates that it is possible to prevent social deviance via a limited social shaming reaction in "labelers" and replacing [[Morality|moral]] indignation with [[Toleration|tolerance]]. Emphasis is placed on the [[Rehabilitation (penology)|rehabilitation]] of offenders through an alteration of their label(s). Related prevention policies include client [[empowerment]] schemes, [[mediation]] and [[conciliation]], victim-offender [[forgiveness]] ceremonies (restorative justice), [[restitution]], [[Reparation (legal)|reparation]], and alternatives to prison programs involving [[Hobby|diversion]]. Labeling theory has been accused of promoting impractical policy implications, and criticized for failing to explain society's most serious offenses.&lt;ref name="Vito1"&gt;{{harvp|Vito|Maahs|Holmes|2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some offenses, including the use of violence, are universally recognized as wrong. Hence, labeling either habitual criminals or those who have caused serious harm as "criminals" is not constructive. Society may use more ''specific'' labels such as "[[murder]]er" or "[[rapist]]" or "[[child abuse]]r" to demonstrate more clearly after the event the extent of its disapproval, but there is a slightly mechanical determinism in asserting that the application of a label will invariably modify the behavior of the one labeled. Further, if one of the functions of the penal system is to reduce [[recidivism]], applying a long-term label may cause prejudice against the offender, resulting in the inability to maintain employment and social relationships.

==The "mentally ill"==
The social construction of [[deviance (sociology)|deviant behavior]] plays an important role in the labeling process that occurs in society. This process involves not only the labeling of criminally deviant behavior, which is behavior that does not fit socially constructed norms, but also labeling that which reflects stereotyped or stigmatized behavior of the "mentally ill". Labeling theory was first applied to the term "[[mentally ill]]" in 1966 when [[Thomas J. Scheff]] published ''Being Mentally Ill''. Scheff challenged common perceptions of [[mental illness]] by claiming that mental illness is manifested solely as a result of societal influence. He argued that society views certain actions as [[deviant]] and, in order to come to terms with and understand these actions, often places the label of mental illness on those who exhibit them. Certain expectations are then placed on these individuals and, over time, they unconsciously change their behavior to fulfill them. Criteria for different mental illnesses are not consistently fulfilled by those who are diagnosed with them because all of these people suffer from the same disorder, they are simply fulfilled because the "mentally ill" believe they are supposed to act a certain way so, over time, come to do so.&lt;ref name=Scheff1&gt;{{harvp|Scheff|1984}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Scheff's theory had many critics, most notably [[Walter Gove]]. Gove consistently argued an almost opposite theory; he believed that society has no influence at all on "mental illness". Instead, any societal perceptions of the "mentally ill" come about as a direct result of these people's behaviors. Most sociologists' views of labeling and mental illness have fallen somewhere between the extremes of Gove and Scheff. On the other hand, it is almost impossible to deny, given both common sense and research findings, that society's negative perceptions of "crazy" people has had some effect on them. It seems that, realistically, labeling can accentuate and prolong the issues termed "mental illness", but it is rarely the full cause.&lt;ref name=Gove1&gt;{{harvp|Gove|1975}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many other studies have been conducted in this general vein. To provide a few examples, several studies have indicated that most people associate being labeled mentally ill as being just as, or even more, stigmatizing than being seen as a [[drug addict]], ex-convict, or [[prostitute]] (for example: Brand &amp; Claiborn 1976). Additionally, Page's 1977 study found that self declared "ex-mental patients" are much less likely to be offered apartment leases or hired for jobs. Clearly, these studies and the dozens of others like them serve to demonstrate that labeling can have a very real and very large effect on the mentally ill. However, labeling has not been proven to be the sole cause of any symptoms of mental illness.

Peggy Thoits discusses the process of labeling someone with a mental illness in her article, "Sociological Approaches to Mental Illness". Working off Thomas Scheff's (1966) theory, Thoits claims that people who are labeled as mentally ill are stereotypically portrayed as unpredictable, dangerous, and unable to care for themselves. She also claims that "people who are labeled as deviant and treated as deviant become deviant".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Thoits|1999|p=134}}&lt;/ref&gt; This statement can be broken down into two processes, one that involves the effects of self-labeling and the other differential treatment from society based on the individual's label. Therefore, if society sees mentally ill individuals as unpredictable, dangerous and reliant on others, then a person who may not actually be mentally ill but has been labeled as such, could become mentally ill.

The label of "mentally ill" may help a person seek help, for example [[psychotherapy]] or [[medication]]. Labels, while they can be stigmatizing, can also lead those who bear them down the road to proper treatment and (hopefully) recovery. If one believes that "being mentally ill" is more than just believing one should fulfill a set of [[diagnostic criteria]] (as Scheff – see above – would argue{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}), then one would probably also agree that there are some who are labeled "mentally ill" who need help. It has been claimed that this could not happen if "we" did not have a way to categorize (and therefore label) them, although there are actually plenty of [[classification of mental disorder|approaches]] to these phenomena that don't use categorical classifications and diagnostic terms, for example [[spectrum disorder|spectrum]] or continuum models. Here, people vary along different dimensions, and everyone falls at different points on each dimension.

Proponents of ''hard labeling'', as opposed to ''soft labeling'', believe that mental illness does not exist, but is merely deviance from [[norm (sociology)|norms]] of society, causing people to believe in mental illness. They view them as socially constructed illnesses and psychotic disorders.&lt;ref name=Link1&gt;{{harvp|Link|Phelan|1999|pp=361–376}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The "homosexual"==
The application of labeling theory to homosexuality has been extremely controversial. It was [[Alfred Kinsey]] and his colleagues who pointed out the big discrepancy between the behavior and the role attached to it. They had observed the often negative consequences of labeling and repeatedly condemned labeling people as homosexual:

:"It is amazing to observe how many psychologists and psychiatrists have accepted this sort of propaganda, and have come to believe that homosexual males and females are discretely different from persons who respond to natural stimuli. Instead of using these terms as substantives which stand for persons, or even as adjectives to describe persons, they may better be used to describe the nature of the overt sexual relations, or of the stimuli to which an individual erotically responds... It would clarify our thinking if the terms could be dropped completely out of our vocabulary....&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Kinsey|Pomeroy|Martin|1948|pp=616–617}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:"Males do not represent two discrete populations, heterosexual and homosexual... Only the human mind invents categories and tries to force facts into pigeonholes. The living world is a continuum in each and every one of its aspects.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Kinsey|Pomeroy|Martin|1948|p=639}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:"The classification of sexual behavior as masturbatory, heterosexual, or homosexual, is, therefore, unfortunate if it suggests that only different types of persons seek out or accept each kind of sexual activity. There is nothing known in the anatomy or physiology of sexual response and orgasm which distinguishes masturbatory, heterosexual, or homosexual reactions....&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Kinsey|Pomeroy|Martin|Gebhard|1953|p=446}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:"In regard to sexual behavior, it has been possible to maintain this dichotomy only by placing all persons who are exclusively heterosexual in a heterosexual category and all persons who have any amount of experience with their own sex, even including those with the slightest experience, in a homosexual category.... The attempt to maintain a simple dichotomy on these matters exposes the traditional biases which are likely to enter whenever the heterosexual or homosexual classification of an individual is involved".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Kinsey|Pomeroy|Martin|Gebhard|1953|pp=468–469}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Erving Goffman's ''Stigma: Notes on the Management of Spoiled Identity'' distinguished between the behavior and the role assigned to it. He wrote:

:"The term 'homosexual' is generally used to refer to anyone who engages in overt sexual practices with a member of his own sex, the practice being called 'homosexuality.' This usage appears to be based on a medical and legal frame of reference and provides much too broad and heterogenous a categorization for use here. I refer only to individuals who participate in a special community of understanding wherein members of one's own sex are defined as the most desirable sexual objects, and sociability is energetically organized around the pursuit and entertainment of these objects."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Goffman|1963|pp=143–144}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Labeling theory was also applied to homosexuality by Evelyn Hooker&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Hooker|1956}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Hooker|1958}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Hooker|1967}}&lt;/ref&gt; and by Leznoff and Westley, who published the first sociological study of the gay community.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Leznoff|Westley|1956}}&lt;/ref&gt; Erving Goffman and Howard Becker used the lives of gay-identified persons in their theories of labeling and interactionism. Simon and Gagnon likewise wrote: "It is necessary to move away from the obsessive concern with the sexuality of the individual, and attempt to see the homosexual in terms of the broader attachments that he must make to live in the world around him."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Simon|Gagnon|1967|p=179}}&lt;/ref&gt;

British sociologist Mary McIntosh reflected the enthusiasm of Europeans for labeling theory in her 1968 study, "The Homosexual Role".

:"The vantage-point of comparative sociology enables us to see that the conception of homosexuality as a condition is, itself, a possible object of study. This conception and the behavior it supports operate as a form of social control in a society in which homosexuality is condemned...

:"It is interesting to notice that homosexuals themselves welcome and support the notion that homosexuality as a condition. For just as the rigid categorization deters people from drifting into deviancy, so it appears to foreclose on the possibility of drifting back into normalcy and thus removes the element of anxious choice. It appears to justify the deviant behavior of the homosexual as being appropriate for him as a member of the homosexual category. The deviancy can thus be seen as legitimate for him and he can continue in it without rejecting the norm of society."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|McIntosh|1968}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sara Fein and Elaine M. Nuehring were among the many who supported the application of labeling theory to homosexuality. They saw the gay role functioning as a "master status" around which other roles become organized. This brings a whole new set of problems and restrictions:

:"Placement in a social category constituting a master status prohibits individuals from choosing the extent of their involvement in various categories. Members of the stigmatized group lose the opportunity to establish their own personal system of evaluation and group membership as well as the ability to arrive at their own ranking of each personal characteristic.... For example, newly self-acknowledged homosexual individuals cannot take for granted that they share the world with others who hold congruent interpretations and assumptions; their behavior and motives, both past and present, will be interpreted in light of their stigma."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Fein|Nuehring|1981}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Perhaps the strongest proponent of labeling theory was Edward Sagarin. In his book, ''Deviants and Deviance'', he wrote, "There are no homosexuals, transvestites, chemical addicts, suicidogenics, delinquents, criminals, or other such entities, in the sense of people having such identities."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Sagarin|1975|p=150}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sagarin's position was roundly condemned by academics in the gay community. Sagarin had written some gay novels under the pseudonym of Donald Webster Cory. According to reports, he later abandoned his gay identity and began promoting an interactionist view of homosexuality.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|DuBay|1967|p=150}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of authors adopted a modified, non-deviant, labeling theory. They rejected the stigmatic function of the gay role, but found it useful in describing the process of [[coming out]] and reconciling one's homosexual experiences with the social role. Their works included:
* [[Colin J. Williams]] and [[Martin Weinberg]], ''Homosexuals and the Military'', 1971.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Williams|Weinberg|1971}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Martin Weinberg and Colin Williams, in "Male Homosexuals: Their Problems and Adaptations," 1974.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Weinberg|Williams|1974}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Barry Adam, in his ''Survival of Domination: Inferiorization of Everyday Life'', took those authors to task for ignoring the force of the oppression in creating identities and their inferiorizing effects. Drawing upon the works of [[Albert Memmi]], Adam showed how gay-identified persons, like Jews and blacks, internalize the hatred to justify their limitations of life choices. He saw the gravitation towards ghettos was evidence of the self-limitations. He wrote:

:"A certain romantic liberalism runs through the literature, evident from attempts to paper over or discount the very real problems of inferiorization. Some researchers seem bent on 'rescuing' their subjects from 'defamation' by ignoring the problems of defeatism and complicit self-destruction. Avoidance of dispiriting reflection upon the day-to-day practice of dominated people appears to spring from a desire to 'enhance' the reputation of the dominated and magically relieve their plight. Careful observation has been sacrificed to the 'power of positive thinking.'"&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Adam|1978|pp=5–6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Strong defense of labeling theory also arose within the gay community. Dan Slater of the Los Angeles Homosexual Information Center said, "There is no such thing as a homosexual lifestyle. There is no such thing as gay pride or anything like that. Homosexuality is simply based on the sex act. Gay consciousness and all the rest are separatist and defeatist attitudes going back to centuries-old and out-moded conceptions that homosexuals are, indeed, different from other people."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Leopold|1975|p=26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a later article, Slater stated the gay movement was going in the wrong direction:

:"Is it the purpose of the movement to try to assert sexual rights for everyone or create a political and social cult out of homosexuality?.... Persons who perform homosexual acts or other non-conforming acts are sexually free. They want others enlightened. They want hostile laws changed, but they resent the attempt to organize their lives around homosexuality just as much as they resent the centuries-old attempt to organize their lives around heterosexuality.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Slater|1971}}&lt;/ref&gt;

William DuBay, in ''Gay Identity: The Self Under Ban'',&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|DuBay|1967}}&lt;/ref&gt; describes gay identity as one strategy for dealing with society's oppression. It solves some problems but creates many more, replacing a closet of secrecy with one of gay identity. A better strategy, he suggests, is to reject the label and live as if the oppression did not exist. Quoting Goffman, he writes, "But of course what is a good adjustment for the individual can be an even better one for society."&lt;ref name="harvp|Goffman|1963|p=122"/&gt; 

DuBay contends that the attempt to define homosexuality as a class of persons to be protected against discrimination as defined in the statutes has not reduced the oppression. The goal of the movement instead should be to gain acceptance of homosexual relationships as useful and productive for both society and the family. The movement has lost the high moral ground by sponsoring the "flight from choice" and not taking up the moral issues. "Persons whom we confine to back rooms and bars other societies have honored as tenders of children, astrologers, dancers, chanters, minstrels, jesters, artists, shamans, sacred warriors and judges, seers, healers, weavers of tales and magic."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|DuBay|1967|p=9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

DuBay refers to the "gay trajectory," in which a person first wraps himself in the gay role, organizing his personality and his life around sexual behavior. He might flee from his family and home town to a large gay center. There, the bedeviling force of the stigma will introduce him to more excessive modes of deviance such as promiscuity, prostitution, alcoholism, and drugs. Many resist such temptations and try to normalize their life, but the fast lanes of gay society are littered with the casualties of gay identity. Some come to reject the label entirely. "Accomplishing the forbidden, they are neither gay nor straight. Again learning to choose, they develop the ability to make the ban ambiguous, taking responsibility and refusing explanations of their behaviors."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|DuBay|1967|p=143}}&lt;/ref&gt;

John Henry Mackay writes about a gay hustler in Berlin adopting such a solution: "What was self-evident, natural, and not the least sick did not require an excuse through an explanation.... It was love just like any other love. Whoever could not or would not accept it as love was mistaken."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Mackay|1985}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modified labeling theory==
Bruce Link and colleagues have conducted several studies which point to the influence that labeling can have on mental patients. Through these studies, which took place in 1987, 1989, and 1997, Link advanced a "modified labeling theory" indicating that expectations of labeling can have a large negative effect, that these expectations often cause patients to withdraw from society, and that those labeled as having a mental disorder are constantly being rejected from society in seemingly minor ways but that, when taken as a whole, all of these small slights can drastically alter their self concepts. They come to both anticipate and perceive negative societal reactions to them, and this potentially damages their quality of life.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Link|Cullen|Struening|Shrout|1989}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Modified labeling theory has been described as a "sophisticated social-psychological model of 'why labels matter{{'"}}. In 2000, results from a prospective two-year study of patients discharged from a mental hospital (in the context of [[deinstitutionalization]]) showed that [[social stigma|stigma]] was a powerful and persistent force in their lives, and that experiences of [[social rejection]] were a persistent source of social stress. Efforts to cope with labels, such as not telling anyone, educating people about mental distress/disorder, withdrawing from stigmatizing situations, could result in further social isolation and reinforce negative self-concepts. Sometimes an identity as a low [[self-esteem]] minority in society would be accepted. The stigma was associated with diminished motivation and ability to "make it in mainstream society" and with "a state of social and psychological vulnerability to prolonged and recurrent problems". There was an up and down pattern in self-esteem, however, and it was suggested that, rather than simply gradual erosion of self-worth and increasing [[self-deprecating]] tendencies, people were sometimes managing, but struggling, to maintain consistent feelings of self-worth. Ultimately, "a cadre of patients had developed an entrenched, negative view of themselves, and their experiences of rejection appear to be a key element in the construction of these self-related feelings" and "hostile neighbourhoods may not only affect their self-concept but may also ultimately impact the patient's mental health status and how successful they are".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Wright|Gronfein|Owens|2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3498">In mathematics, '''Serre''' and '''localizing subcategories''' form important classes of [[Subcategory|subcategories]] of an [[abelian category]]. Localizing subcategories are certain Serre subcategories. They are strongly linked to the notion of a [[quotient category]].

== Serre subcategories ==

Let &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{A}&lt;/math&gt; be an [[abelian category]]. A non-empty full [[subcategory]] &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{C}&lt;/math&gt; is called a ''Serre subcategory'' (or also a ''dense subcategory''), if for every short [[exact sequence]] &lt;math&gt;0\rightarrow
A' \rightarrow A\rightarrow A''\rightarrow 0&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{A}&lt;/math&gt; the object &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is in &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{C}&lt;/math&gt; if and only if the objects &lt;math&gt;A'&lt;/math&gt;
and &lt;math&gt;A''&lt;/math&gt; belong to &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{C}&lt;/math&gt;. In words: &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{C}&lt;/math&gt; is closed under subobjects, quotient objects
and extensions.

The importance of this notion stems from the fact that kernels of [[exact functor|exact functors]] between abelian categories have this property, and that one can build (for locally small &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{A}&lt;/math&gt;) the [[Quotient of an abelian category|quotient category]] (in the sense of [[Pierre Gabriel|Gabriel]], [[Alexander Grothendieck|Grothendieck]],
[[Jean-Pierre Serre|Serre]]) &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{A}/\mathcal{C}&lt;/math&gt;, which has the same objects as &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{A}&lt;/math&gt;, is abelian, and comes with an exact functor (called the quotient functor) &lt;math&gt;T\colon\mathcal{A}\rightarrow\mathcal{A}/\mathcal{C}&lt;/math&gt; whose kernel is &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{C}&lt;/math&gt;.

== Localizing subcategories ==

Let &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{A}&lt;/math&gt; be locally small. The Serre subcategory &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{C}&lt;/math&gt; is called ''localizing'', if the quotient functor
&lt;math&gt;T\colon\mathcal{A}\rightarrow\mathcal{A}/\mathcal{C}&lt;/math&gt; has a
[[Adjoint functors|right adjoint]]
&lt;math&gt;S\colon\mathcal{A}/\mathcal{C}\rightarrow\mathcal{A}&lt;/math&gt;. Since then &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt;, as a left adjoint, preserves [[Limit (category theory)|colimits]], each localizing subcategory is closed under colimits. The functor &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; (or sometimes &lt;math&gt;ST&lt;/math&gt;) is also called the ''localization functor'', and &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; the ''section functor''. The section functor is [[exact functor|left-exact]] and [[Full and faithful functors|fully faithful]].

If the abelian category &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{A}&lt;/math&gt; is moreover
[[complete category|cocomplete]] and has [[injective hull|injective hulls]] (e.g. if it is a [[Grothendieck category]]), then a Serre
subcategory &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{C}&lt;/math&gt; is localizing if and only if
&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{C}&lt;/math&gt; is closed under arbitrary coproducts (a.k.a.
direct sums). Hence the notion of a localizing subcategory is
equivalent to the notion of a hereditary [[Torsion theory|torsion class]].

If &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{A}&lt;/math&gt; is a Grothendieck category and
&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{C}&lt;/math&gt; a localizing subcategory, then the quotient category
&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{A}/\mathcal{C}&lt;/math&gt; is again a Grothendieck category.

The [[Gabriel-Popescu theorem]] implies that every Grothendieck category is the quotient category of a [[category of modules|module category]] &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Mod}(R)&lt;/math&gt; (with &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; a suitable [[Ring (mathematics)|ring]]) modulo a localizing subcategory.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="23184">In [[mathematics]], a '''low-discrepancy sequence''' is a [[sequence]] with the property that for all values of ''N'', its subsequence ''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''N''&lt;/sub&gt; has a low [[discrepancy of a sequence|discrepancy]].

Roughly speaking, the discrepancy of a sequence is low if the proportion of points in the sequence falling into an arbitrary set ''B'' is close to proportional to the [[Measure (mathematics)|measure]] of ''B'', as would happen on average (but not for particular samples) in the case of an [[equidistributed sequence]]. Specific definitions of discrepancy differ regarding the choice of ''B'' ([[hyperspheres]], hypercubes, etc.) and how the discrepancy for every B is computed (usually normalized) and combined (usually by taking the worst value).

Low-discrepancy sequences are also called '''quasi-random''' or '''sub-random''' sequences, due to their common use as a replacement of uniformly distributed [[random sequence|random numbers]].
The "quasi" modifier is used to denote more clearly that the values of a low-discrepancy sequence are neither random nor [[pseudorandom]], but such sequences share some properties of random variables and in certain applications such as the [[quasi-Monte Carlo method]] their lower discrepancy is an important advantage.

==Applications==

[[Image:Subrandom Kurtosis.gif|thumb|370px|right|Error in estimated kurtosis as a function of number of datapoints. 'Additive subrandom' gives the maximum error when ''c''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;({{radic|5}}&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1)/2. 'Random' gives the average error over six runs of random numbers, where the average is taken to reduce the magnitude of the wild fluctuations]]

Subrandom numbers have an advantage over pure random numbers in that they cover the domain of interest quickly and evenly. They have an advantage over purely deterministic methods in that deterministic methods only give high accuracy when the number of datapoints is pre-set whereas in using subrandom sequences the accuracy typically improves continually as more datapoints are added, with full reuse of the existing points. On the other hand, subrandom sets can have a significant lower discrepancy for a given number of points than purely random sequences.

Two useful applications are in finding the [[characteristic function (probability theory)|characteristic function]] of a [[probability density function]], and in finding the [[derivative]] function of a deterministic function with a small amount of noise. Subrandom numbers allow higher-order [[moment (mathematics)|moments]] to be calculated to high accuracy very quickly.

Applications that don't involve sorting would be in finding the [[mean]], [[standard deviation]], [[skewness]] and [[kurtosis]] of a statistical distribution, and in finding the [[integral]] and global [[maxima and minima]] of difficult deterministic functions. Subrandom numbers can also be used for providing starting points for deterministic algorithms that only work locally, such as [[Newton–Raphson iteration]].

Subrandom numbers can also be combined with search algorithms. A binary tree [[Quicksort]]-style algorithm ought to work exceptionally well because subrandom numbers flatten the tree far better than random numbers, and the flatter the tree the faster the sorting. With a search algorithm, subrandom numbers can be used to find the [[mode (statistics)|mode]], [[median]], [[confidence intervals]] and [[cumulative distribution function|cumulative distribution]] of a statistical distribution, and all [[local minima]] and all solutions of deterministic functions.

=== Low-discrepancy sequences in numerical integration ===

At least three methods of [[numerical integration]] can be phrased as follows.
Given a set {''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''N''&lt;/sub&gt;} in the interval &lt;nowiki&gt;[0,1]&lt;/nowiki&gt;, approximate the integral of a function ''f'' as the average of the function evaluated at those points:

:&lt;math&gt; \int_0^1 f(u)\,du \approx \frac{1}{N}\,\sum_{i=1}^N f(x_i). &lt;/math&gt;

If the points are chosen as ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; = ''i''/''N'', this is the ''rectangle rule''.
If the points are chosen to be randomly (or [[pseudorandom]]ly) distributed, this is the ''[[Monte Carlo method]]''.
If the points are chosen as elements of a low-discrepancy sequence, this is the ''quasi-Monte Carlo method''.
A remarkable result, the '''Koksma–Hlawka inequality''' (stated below), shows that the error of such a method can be bounded by the product of two terms, one of which depends only on ''f'', and the other one is the discrepancy of the set {''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''N''&lt;/sub&gt;}.

It is convenient to construct the set {''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''N''&lt;/sub&gt;} in such a way that if a set with ''N''+1 elements is constructed, the previous ''N'' elements need not be recomputed.
The rectangle rule uses points set which have low discrepancy, but in general the elements must be recomputed if ''N'' is increased.
Elements need not be recomputed in the random Monte Carlo method if ''N'' is increased,
but the point sets do not have minimal discrepancy.
By using low-discrepancy sequences we aim for low discrepancy and no need for recomputations, but actually low-discrepancy sequences can only be incrementally good on discrepancy if we allow no recomputation.

==Definition of discrepancy==

The ''discrepancy'' of a set P = {''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''N''&lt;/sub&gt;} is defined, using [[Harald Niederreiter|Niederreiter's]] notation, as
:&lt;math&gt; D_N(P) = \sup_{B\in J}
  \left|  \frac{A(B;P)}{N} - \lambda_s(B)  \right|&lt;/math&gt;

where
λ&lt;sub&gt;''s''&lt;/sub&gt; is the ''s''-dimensional [[Lebesgue measure]],
''A''(''B'';''P'') is the number of points in ''P'' that fall into ''B'',
and ''J'' is the set of ''s''-dimensional intervals or boxes of the form

:&lt;math&gt; \prod_{i=1}^s [a_i, b_i) = \{ \mathbf{x} \in \mathbf{R}^s : a_i \le x_i &lt; b_i \} \, &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt; 0 \le a_i &lt; b_i \le 1 &lt;/math&gt;.

The ''star-discrepancy'' ''D''&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;''N''&lt;/sub&gt;(''P'') is defined similarly, except that the supremum is taken over the set ''J''&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt; of rectangular boxes of the form

:&lt;math&gt; \prod_{i=1}^s [0, u_i) &lt;/math&gt;

where ''u''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; is in the half-open interval &lt;nowiki&gt;[0, 1)&lt;/nowiki&gt;.

The two are related by

:&lt;math&gt;D^*_N \le D_N \le 2^s D^*_N . \,&lt;/math&gt;

Note: With these definitions, discrepancy represents the worst-case or maximum point density deviation of a uniform set. However, also other error measures are meaningful, leading to other definitions and variation measures. For instance, L2 discrepancy or modified centered L2 discrepancy are also used intensively to compare the quality of uniform point sets. Both are much easier to calculate for large N and s.

==The Koksma–Hlawka inequality==

Let Ī&lt;sup&gt;''s''&lt;/sup&gt; be the ''s''-dimensional unit cube,
Ī&lt;sup&gt;''s''&lt;/sup&gt; = [0, 1] &amp;times; ... &amp;times; [0, 1].
Let ''f'' have [[bounded variation]] ''V''(''f'') on Ī&lt;sup&gt;''s''&lt;/sup&gt; in the sense of [[G. H. Hardy|Hardy]] and Krause.
Then for any ''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''N''&lt;/sub&gt;
in ''I''&lt;sup&gt;''s''&lt;/sup&gt; =
&lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;0, 1&lt;nowiki&gt;)&lt;/nowiki&gt; &amp;times; ... &amp;times;
&lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;0, 1&lt;nowiki&gt;)&lt;/nowiki&gt;,
: &lt;math&gt; \left| \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^N f(x_i)
      - \int_{\bar I^s} f(u)\,du \right|
     \le V(f)\, D_N^* (x_1,\ldots,x_N).
&lt;/math&gt;

The [[Jurjen Ferdinand Koksma|Koksma]]–[[Edmund Hlawka|Hlawka]] inequality is sharp in the following sense: For any point set {''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,...,''x''&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt;} in ''I''&lt;sup&gt;s&lt;/sup&gt; and any &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;, there is a function ''f'' with bounded variation and ''V''(''f'')&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1 such that

:&lt;math&gt;
\left| \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^N f(x_i)
      - \int_{\bar I^s} f(u)\,du \right|&gt;D_{N}^{*}(x_1,\ldots,x_N)-\varepsilon.
&lt;/math&gt;

Therefore, the quality of a numerical integration rule depends only on the discrepancy D&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt;(''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,...,''x''&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt;).

==The formula of Hlawka–Zaremba==

Let &lt;math&gt;D=\{1,2,\ldots,d\}&lt;/math&gt;. For &lt;math&gt;\emptyset\neq u\subseteq D&lt;/math&gt; we
write
:&lt;math&gt;
dx_u:=\prod_{j\in u} dx_j
&lt;/math&gt;
and denote by &lt;math&gt;(x_u,1)&lt;/math&gt; the point obtained from ''x'' by replacing the
coordinates not in ''u'' by &lt;math&gt;1&lt;/math&gt;. Then

:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^N f(x_i)
      - \int_{\bar I^s} f(u)\,du=
\sum_{\emptyset\neq u\subseteq D}(-1)^{|u|}
\int_{[0,1]^{|u|}} \operatorname{disc}(x_u,1)\frac{\partial^{|u|}}{\partial x_u}f(x_u,1) \, dx_u,
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{disc}(z)= \frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^N \prod_{j=1}^d 1_{[0,z_j)}(x_{i,j}) - \prod_{j=1}^d z_i&lt;/math&gt; is the discrepancy function.

==The &lt;math&gt;L^2&lt;/math&gt; version of the Koksma–Hlawka inequality==

Applying the [[Cauchy–Schwarz inequality]] for integrals and sums to the Hlawka–Zaremba identity, we obtain an &lt;math&gt;L^2&lt;/math&gt; version of the Koksma–Hlawka inequality:

: &lt;math&gt;
\left|\frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^N f(x_i)
      - \int_{\bar I^s} f(u)\,du\right|\le
\|f\|_d \operatorname{disc}_d (\{t_i\}),
&lt;/math&gt;

where

:&lt;math&gt;
\operatorname{disc}_d(\{t_i\})=\left(\sum_{\emptyset\neq u\subseteq D}
\int_{[0,1]^{|u|}} \operatorname{disc}(x_u,1)^2 \, dx_u\right)^{1/2}
&lt;/math&gt;

and

:&lt;math&gt;
\|f\|_d = \left(\sum_{u\subseteq D}
\int_{[0,1]^{|u|}}
\left|\frac{\partial^{|u|}}{\partial x_u} f(x_u,1)\right|^2 dx_u\right)^{1/2}.
&lt;/math&gt;
L2 discrepancy has a high practical importance because fast explicit calculations are possible for a given point set. This way it is easy to create point set optimizers using L2 discrepancy as criteria.

==The Erd&amp;#337;s–Turán–Koksma inequality==

It is computationally hard to find the exact value of the discrepancy of large point sets. The [[Paul Erd&amp;#337;s|Erd&amp;#337;s]]–[[Turán]]–[[Jurjen Ferdinand Koksma|Koksma]] inequality provides an upper bound.

Let ''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,...,''x''&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt; be points in ''I''&lt;sup&gt;s&lt;/sup&gt; and ''H'' be an arbitrary positive integer. Then

:&lt;math&gt;
D_{N}^{*}(x_1,\ldots,x_N)\leq
\left(\frac{3}{2}\right)^s
\left(
\frac{2}{H+1}+
\sum_{0&lt;\|h\|_{\infty}\leq H}\frac{1}{r(h)}
\left|
\frac{1}{N}
\sum_{n=1}^{N} e^{2\pi i\langle h,x_n\rangle}
\right|
\right)
&lt;/math&gt;

where

:&lt;math&gt;
r(h)=\prod_{i=1}^s\max\{1,|h_i|\}\quad\mbox{for}\quad h=(h_1,\ldots,h_s)\in\Z^s.
&lt;/math&gt;

==The main conjectures==

'''Conjecture 1.''' There is a constant ''c''&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt; depending only on the dimension ''s'', such that

:&lt;math&gt;D_{N}^{*}(x_1,\ldots,x_N)\geq c_s\frac{(\ln N)^{s-1}}{N}&lt;/math&gt;

for any finite point set  {''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,...,''x''&lt;sub&gt;''N''&lt;/sub&gt;}.

'''Conjecture 2.'''  There is a constant ''c''&lt;sup&gt;'&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt; depending only on ''s'', such that

:&lt;math&gt;D_{N}^{*}(x_1,\ldots,x_N)\geq c'_s\frac{(\ln N)^{s}}{N}&lt;/math&gt;

for infinite number of ''N'' for any infinite sequence  ''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,''x''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;,....

These conjectures are equivalent. They have been proved for ''s'' ≤ 2 by [[W. M. Schmidt]]. In higher dimensions, the corresponding problem is still open. The best-known lower bounds are due to [[K. F. Roth]].

==Lower bounds==

Let ''s''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1. Then

:&lt;math&gt;
D_N^*(x_1,\ldots,x_N)\geq\frac{1}{2N}
&lt;/math&gt;

for any finite point set {''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;...,&amp;nbsp;''x''&lt;sub&gt;''N''&lt;/sub&gt;}.

Let ''s''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;2. W. M. Schmidt proved that for any finite point set {''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;...,&amp;nbsp;''x''&lt;sub&gt;''N''&lt;/sub&gt;},

:&lt;math&gt;
D_N^*(x_1,\ldots,x_N)\geq C\frac{\log N}{N}
&lt;/math&gt;

where

:&lt;math&gt;
C=\max_{a\geq3}\frac{1}{16}\frac{a-2}{a\log a}=0.023335\dots
&lt;/math&gt;

For arbitrary dimensions ''s''&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;1, K.F. Roth proved that

:&lt;math&gt;
D_N^*(x_1,\ldots,x_N)\geq\frac{1}{2^{4s}}\frac{1}{((s-1)\log2)^\frac{s-1}{2}}\frac{\log^{\frac{s-1}{2}}N}{N}
&lt;/math&gt;

for any finite point set {''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;...,&amp;nbsp;''x''&lt;sub&gt;''N''&lt;/sub&gt;}.
This bound is the best known for ''s''&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;3.

==Construction of low-discrepancy sequences==

Because any distribution of random numbers can be mapped onto a uniform distribution, and subrandom numbers are mapped in the same way, this article only concerns generation of subrandom numbers on a multidimensional uniform distribution.

There are constructions of sequences known such that
:&lt;math&gt;
D_N^{*}(x_1,\ldots,x_N)\leq C\frac{(\ln N)^{s}}{N}.
&lt;/math&gt;
where ''C'' is a certain constant, depending on the sequence. After Conjecture 2, these sequences are believed to have the best possible order of convergence. Examples below are the [[van der Corput sequence]], the [[Halton sequence]]s, and the [[Sobol sequence]]s. One general limitation is that construction methods can usually only guarantee the order of convergence. Practically, low discrepancy can be only achieved if N is large enough, and for large given s this minimum N can be very large. This means running a Monte-Carlo analysis with e.g. s=20 variables and N=1000 points from a low-discrepancy sequence generator may offer only a very minor accuracy improvement.

===Random numbers===

Sequences of subrandom numbers can be generated from random numbers by imposing a negative correlation on those random numbers. One way to do this is to start with a set of random numbers &lt;math&gt;r_i&lt;/math&gt; on &lt;math&gt;[0,0.5)&lt;/math&gt; and construct subrandom numbers &lt;math&gt;s_i&lt;/math&gt; which are uniform on &lt;math&gt;[0,1)&lt;/math&gt; using:

&lt;math&gt;s_i = r_i&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; odd and &lt;math&gt;s_i = 0.5 + r_i&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; even.

A second way to do it with the starting random numbers is to construct a random walk with offset 0.5 as in:

: &lt;math&gt;s_i = s_{i-1} + 0.5+ r_i \pmod 1. \, &lt;/math&gt;

That is, take the previous subrandom number, add 0.5 and the random number, and take the result [[modular arithmetic|modulo]]&amp;nbsp;1.

For more than one dimension, [[Latin squares]] of the appropriate dimension can be used to provide offsets to ensure that the whole domain is covered evenly.

[[Image:Subrandom 2D.gif|thumb|270px|right|Coverage of the unit square. Left for additive subrandom numbers with ''c''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0.5545497...,&amp;nbsp;0.308517... Right for random numbers. From top to bottom. 10, 100, 1000, 10000 points.]]

===Additive recurrence===

For any irrational &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt;, the sequence

: &lt;math&gt;s_n = \{s_0 + n\alpha\}&lt;/math&gt;

has discrepancy tending to 0. (Note the sequence can be defined recursively by &lt;math&gt;s_{n+1} = (s_n + \alpha)\bmod\, 1&lt;/math&gt;.) A good value of &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; gives lower discrepancy than a sequence of independent uniform random numbers.

The discrepancy can be bounded by the [[approximation exponent]] of &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt;. If the approximation exponent is &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt;, then for any &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;, the following bound holds:&lt;ref name="kn05"&gt;Kuipers and Niederreiter, 2005, p. 123&lt;/ref&gt;

: &lt;math&gt; D_N((s_n)) = O_\varepsilon (N^{-1/(\mu-1)+\varepsilon}).&lt;/math&gt;

By the [[Thue–Siegel–Roth theorem]], the approximation exponent of any irrational algebraic number is 2, giving a bound of &lt;math&gt;N^{-1+\varepsilon}&lt;/math&gt; above.

The value of &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; with lowest discrepancy is &lt;ref&gt;http://mollwollfumble.blogspot.com/, Subrandom numbers&lt;/ref&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;c = \frac{\sqrt{5}-1}{2} \approx 0.618034.&lt;/math&gt;

Another value that is nearly as good is:

: &lt;math&gt;c = \sqrt{2}-1 \approx 0.414214. \, &lt;/math&gt;

In more than one dimension, separate subrandom numbers are needed for each dimension.  In higher dimensions, one set of values that can be used is the square roots of [[primes]] from two up, all taken modulo 1:

: &lt;math&gt;c = \sqrt{2}, \sqrt{3}, \sqrt{5}, \sqrt{7}, \sqrt{11}, \ldots \, &lt;/math&gt;

The recurrence relation above is similar to the recurrence relation used by a [[Linear congruential generator]], a poor-quality pseudorandom number generator:&lt;ref&gt;Donald E. Knuth ''The Art of Computer Programming'' Vol. 2, Ch. 3&lt;/ref&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;r_i = \bmod(a r_{i-1} + c, m)&lt;/math&gt;

For the low discrepancy additive recurrence above, a and m are chosen to be 1.  Note, however, that this will not generate independent random numbers, so should not be used for purposes requiring independence.  The [[list of pseudorandom number generators]] lists methods for generating independent pseudorandom numbers.
Note: In few dimensions, recursive recurrence leads to uniform sets of good quality, but for larger s (like s&gt;8) other point set generators can offer much lower discrepancies.

===van der Corput sequence===
{{Main article|van der Corput sequence}}

Let

:&lt;math&gt;
n=\sum_{k=0}^{L-1}d_k(n)b^k
&lt;/math&gt;

be the ''b''-ary representation of the positive integer ''n'' ≥ 1, i.e. 0 ≤ ''d''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;(''n'') &lt; ''b''. Set

:&lt;math&gt;
g_b(n)=\sum_{k=0}^{L-1}d_k(n)b^{-k-1}.
&lt;/math&gt;

Then there is a constant ''C'' depending only on ''b'' such that (''g''&lt;sub&gt;''b''&lt;/sub&gt;(''n''))&lt;sub&gt;''n'' ≥ 1&lt;/sub&gt;satisfies

:&lt;math&gt;
D^*_N(g_b(1),\dots,g_b(N))\leq C\frac{\log N}{N},
&lt;/math&gt;

where ''D''&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;''N''&lt;/sub&gt; is the  
'''[[Low-discrepancy sequence#Definition of discrepancy|star discrepancy]]'''.

===Halton sequence===
[[Image:Halton sequence 2D.svg|thumb|right|First 256 points of the (2,3) Halton sequence]]
{{Main article|Halton sequence}}

The Halton sequence is a natural generalization of the van der Corput sequence to higher dimensions. Let ''s'' be an arbitrary dimension and ''b''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''b''&lt;sub&gt;''s''&lt;/sub&gt; be arbitrary [[coprime]] integers greater than 1. Define

:&lt;math&gt;
x(n)=(g_{b_1}(n),\dots,g_{b_s}(n)).
&lt;/math&gt;

Then there is a constant ''C'' depending only on ''b''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''b''&lt;sub&gt;''s''&lt;/sub&gt;, such that sequence {''x''(''n'')}&lt;sub&gt;''n''≥1&lt;/sub&gt; is a ''s''-dimensional sequence with

:&lt;math&gt;
D^*_N(x(1),\dots,x(N))\leq C'\frac{(\log N)^s}{N}.
&lt;/math&gt;

===Hammersley set===

[[File:Hammersley set 2D.svg|thumb|right|2D Hammersley set of size 256]]
Let ''b''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,...,''b''&lt;sub&gt;s-1&lt;/sub&gt; be [[coprime]] positive integers greater than 1. For given ''s'' and ''N'', the ''s''-dimensional [[John Hammersley|Hammersley]] set of size ''N'' is defined by&lt;ref name="HammersleyHandscomb1964"&gt;{{cite book|title=Monte Carlo Methods|last1=Hammersley|first1=J. M.|last2=Handscomb|first2=D. C.|year=1964|doi=10.1007/978-94-009-5819-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
x(n)=(g_{b_1}(n),\dots,g_{b_{s-1}}(n),\frac{n}{N})
&lt;/math&gt;

for ''n'' = 1, ..., ''N''. Then

:&lt;math&gt;
D^*_N(x(1),\dots,x(N))\leq C\frac{(\log N)^{s-1}}{N}
&lt;/math&gt;

where ''C'' is a constant depending only on ''b''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''b''&lt;sub&gt;''s''&amp;minus;1&lt;/sub&gt;.
Note: The formulas show that the Hammersley set is actually the Halton sequence, but we get one more dimension for free by adding a linear sweep. This is only possible if N is known upfront. A linear set is also the set with lowest possible one-dimensional discrepancy in general. Unfortunately, for higher dimensions, no such "discrepancy record sets" are known. For s=2, most low-discrepancy point set generators deliver at least near-optimum discrepancies.

===Sobol sequence===
{{Main article|Sobol sequence}}

The Antonov–Saleev variant of the Sobol sequence generates numbers between zero and one directly as binary fractions of length &lt;math&gt;w&lt;/math&gt;, from a set of &lt;math&gt;w&lt;/math&gt; special binary fractions, &lt;math&gt;V_i, i = 1, 2, \dots, w&lt;/math&gt; called direction numbers. The bits of the [[Gray code]] of &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;G(i)&lt;/math&gt;, are used to select direction numbers. To get the Sobol sequence value &lt;math&gt;s_i&lt;/math&gt; take the [[exclusive or]] of the binary value of the Gray code of &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; with the appropriate direction number. The number of dimensions required affects the choice of &lt;math&gt;V_i&lt;/math&gt;.

=== Poisson disk sampling ===
{{main article|Supersampling#Poisson_disc}}
[[Supersampling#Poisson disc|Poisson disk sampling]] is popular in video games to rapidly placing objects in a way that appears random-looking
but guarantees that every two points are separated by at least the specified minimum distance.&lt;ref&gt;
Herman Tulleken.
[http://devmag.org.za/2009/05/03/poisson-disk-sampling/ "Poisson Disk Sampling"].
''Dev.Mag'' Issue 21, March 2008.
&lt;/ref&gt; This does not guarantee low discrepancy (as e. g. Sobol), but at least a significantly lower discrepancy than pure random sampling.

==Graphical examples==
The points plotted below are the first 100, 1000, and 10000 elements in a sequence of the Sobol' type.
For comparison, 10000 elements of a sequence of pseudorandom points are also shown.
The low-discrepancy sequence was generated by [[ACM Transactions on Mathematical Software|TOMS]] algorithm 659.&lt;ref&gt;P. Bratley and B.L. Fox in ''ACM Transactions on Mathematical Software'', vol. 14, no. 1, pp 88—100&lt;/ref&gt;
An implementation of the algorithm in [[Fortran]] is available from [[Netlib]].

'''Maharashtra Andhashraddha Nirmoolan Samiti''' (MANS; or Committee for Eradication of Blind Faith, CEBF) is an organisation dedicated to fighting [[superstition in India]], particularly in the province of [[Maharashtra]]. It was founded by [[Narendra Dabholkar]] in 1989.&lt;ref name="not against"/&gt; It is currently headed by Avinash Patil after Dabholkar's assassination.&lt;ref name=Avinash&gt;{{cite news|title=Avinash Patil to take over reins of MANS|url=http://www.indianexpress.com/news/avinash-patil-to-take-over-reins-of-mans/1162190/|accessdate=23 October 2013|newspaper=[[The Indian Express]]|date=30 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History and work==

It was founded by Narendra Dabholkar in 1989.&lt;ref name="not against"&gt;{{cite news|title=He was not against God but fought exploitation|url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/he-was-not-against-god-but-fought-exploitation/article5042507.ece?ref=relatedNews|accessdate=23 October 2013|newspaper=[[The Hindu]]|date=21 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1999, MANS had protested the canonisation of [[Mother Teresa]] on the basis of purported miracles, but they had praised her service to the ailing and diseased.&lt;ref name=teresa&gt;{{cite news|title=Don't ascribe miracles to Mother Teresa|url=http://www.indianexpress.com/Storyold/128448/|accessdate=23 October 2013|newspaper=[[The Indian Express]]|date=23 October 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The organisation has also campaigned against immersion of [[Ganesh Chaturthi|Ganesha]] idols in water bodies. They have been urging people to use smaller idols and vegetable dyes to avoid polluting rivers and lakes.&lt;ref name=idol&gt;{{cite news|title=Samiti appeals against immersion of idols|url=http://www.indianexpress.com/Storyold/122216/|accessdate=23 October 2013|date=18 September 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; They have urged people to immerse the idols into the tanks built specially for this purpose on the riverbanks.&lt;ref name=tanks&gt;{{cite news|title=Pune Municipal Corporation failed to curb river pollution|url=http://www.dnaindia.com/mumbai/report-pune-municipal-corporation-failed-to-curb-river-pollution-1587736|accessdate=23 October 2013|newspaper=[[DNA India]]|date=16 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

They have protested the torture of mentally ill people under the superstitious belief that it will cure them. Such practices are carried out in a [[dargah]] in [[Chalisgaon]].&lt;ref name=mentally&gt;{{cite news|title=Stop inhuman treatment of mentally ill at Chalisgaon, demands organisation|url=http://www.dnaindia.com/mumbai/report-stop-inhuman-treatment-of-mentally-ill-at-chalisgaon-demands-organisation-1619386|accessdate=23 October 2013|newspaper=[[DNA India]]|date=30 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

MANS has also challenged [[Godman (India)|godmen]] who claim to perform miracles. In December 2002, a prize of {{currency|11|INR}} [[lakh]] was announced to be given to anyone who could perform one of the listed 12 miracles. The list included walking on water, floating in air, standing on hot coals for five minutes, being present in two places simultaneously and materialising necklaces from thin air, among others. Members of MANS toured rural areas debunking these godmen.&lt;ref name=godmen&gt;{{cite news|title=State-wide drive against godmen under way|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2002-12-11/pune/27324744_1_godmen-ans-andhashraddha-nirmulan-samiti|accessdate=23 October 2013|newspaper=[[The Times of India]]|date=11 December 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

They have campaigned against astrology. In October 2009, MANS organised a contest with a prize money of {{currency|21|INR}} [[lakh]] challenging astrologers to predict the results of the Maharashtra Assembly poll election with at least 80% accuracy.&lt;ref name=poll&gt;{{cite news|title=Predict poll results in Maharashtra, win Rs 21 lakh!|url=http://www.indianexpress.com/news/predict-poll-results-in-maharashtra-win-rs-21-lakh/528976/|accessdate=23 October 2013|newspaper=[[The Indian Express]]|date=14 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Anti-Superstition and Black Magic Bill==
{{main|Anti-Superstition and Black Magic Ordinance}}

MANS had been campaigning for a law to check the exploitation of people's superstitions in Maharashtra for a long time. In 1989 at the Andhashraddha Nirmoolan Jahirnama Parishad held that year in [[Pune]], then Chief minister Sharad Pawar had indicated the formation of a law in that direction. The issue was raised again in 1995 in the Legislative Council. On 28 July 2003, MANS members organised a hunger strike outside the State Assembly in Mumbai to protest the state's inaction.&lt;ref name=strike&gt;{{cite news|title=Hunger strike planned for anti-superstition law|url=http://cities.expressindia.com/fullstory.php?newsid=57174|accessdate=23 October 2013|newspaper=[[The Indian Express]]|date=8 July 2003|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030716020619/http://cities.expressindia.com/fullstory.php?newsid=57174|archivedate=16 July 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 2 March 2009, MANS members wrote a letter in blood and sent to then Chief Minister [[Ashok Chavan]] and others to urge them to take steps towards the passing of the law.&lt;ref name="blood letter"&gt;{{cite news|title=ANS members write letters in blood|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2009-03-03/pune/28005676_1_ans-state-wide-protest-blood|accessdate=23 October 2013|newspaper=[[The Times of India]]|date=3 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 7 April 2011, they organised a rally to spread awareness about the law.&lt;ref name=rally&gt;{{cite news|title=Rally to press for anti-superstition bill|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2011-04-05/pune/29384219_1_anti-superstition-bill-training-programme-narendra-dabholkar|accessdate=23 October 2013|newspaper=[[The Times of India]]|date=5 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; They also ran [[telegram]]-sending campaign from 7 July to 25 July 2011 to draw attention to the issue. The telegrams were sent to the Chief Minister.&lt;ref name=cable&gt;{{cite news|title=Putting pressure: Cable campaign for anti-superstition bill|url=http://www.dnaindia.com/mumbai/report-putting-pressure-cable-campaign-for-anti-superstition-bill-1563688|accessdate=23 October 2013|newspaper=[[DNA India]]|date=8 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dabholkar was murdered on 20 August 2013. The pending Anti-Superstition and Black Magic Ordinance was [[promulgated]] in the state of Maharashtra, four days after his death.&lt;ref name=ordinance&gt;{{cite news|title=The anti-black magic and superstition ordinance has been promulgated in Maharashtra|url=http://www.dnaindia.com/india/report-the-anti-black-magic-and-superstition-ordinance-has-been-promulgated-in-maharashtra-1879444|accessdate=23 October 2013|newspaper=[[DNA India]]|date=24 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Maharat''''' is a Yeshiva located in Bronx, NY, which is the first Orthodox institution in North America to ordain Orthodox women. The word ''maharat'' (מהרת) is a Hebrew acronym for words ''manhiga hilkhatit rukhanit Toranit'' ({{Lang-he-n|מנהיגה הלכתית רוחנית תורנית}}) denoting a female "leader of [[Halakha|Jewish law]] spirituality and [[Torah]]". Maharat, as a clergy title, is awarded with [[smicha|semikha]] to the graduates of a 4-year-long program composed of profound studies of Jewish law, [[Talmud]], [[Torah]], Jewish thought, [[leadership]] training, and pastoral counseling.

==History==
In 2009, Rabbi [[Avi Weiss]] and Rabbi [[Daniel Sperber]] ordained [[Sara Hurwitz]].&lt;ref name="moment"&gt;{{cite news | title=Do 1 Rabba, 2 Rabbis and 1 Yeshiva = a New Denomination?| last= Breger |first=Sarah | date= November–December 2010| work= [[Moment Magazine]] |accessdate= July 31, 2013 | url= http://www.momentmag.com/do-1-rabba-2-rabbis-and-1-yeshiva-a-new-denomination/}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was the first woman to receive Orthodox [[Semikhah|semikha]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://forward.com/opinion/editorial/178571/the-maharat-movement/ |title=The Maharat Movement - Editorial – |publisher=Forward.com |date=2013-06-13 |accessdate=2015-06-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; That same year Hurwitz and Weiss founded an Orthodox [[yeshiva]] (religious school) for women: ''[http://www.yeshivatmaharat.org/mission-and-history/ Yeshivat Maharat]''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://njjewishnews.com/article/8463/we-want-to-place-these-women-in-synagogues|title = We want to place these women in synagogues|date = 2012-02-24|accessdate = 2015-06-30|website = New Jersey Jewish News|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; in New York, where Hurwitz serves as President. In 2018-2019, its 10th year, Maharat has graduated 26 women who are serving in clergy roles in synagogues, schools, hospitals, universities and Jewish communal institutions.  There are 31 more students in the pipeline, preparing to change the landscape of Orthodox Judaism and the community at large. Maharat has impacted over 50 communities worldwide.

Graduates of Maharat utilize titles such as ''Maharat'','' Rabba'' (רבה, a neologism), ''Rabbanit'' (רבנית, traditionally denoting a [[Rebbetzin|rabbi's wife]]) and ''Rabbi'' (רבי). In 2015, [[Lila Kagedan]] was ordained as Rabbi by that same organization, making her their first graduate to take the title rabbi.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cjnews.com/living-jewish/jewish-learning/why-orthodox-judaism-needs-female-rabbis|title=Why Orthodox Judaism needs female rabbis|author=Rabbi Lila Kagedan|date=25 November 2015|website=The Canadian Jewish News}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = First female graduate of Orthodox seminary hired by synagogue|url = http://www.jta.org/2016/01/03/news-opinion/united-states/first-u-s-orthodox-woman-to-take-rabbi-title-says-congregation-hired-her|website = Jewish Telegraphic Agency|access-date = 2016-01-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = First female rabbi to lead Orthodox synagogue|url = http://jewishstandard.timesofisrael.com/first-female-rabbi-to-lead-orthodox-synagogue/|website = Jewish Standard|access-date = 2016-01-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = New Jersey Orthodox Synagogue Hires Woman Who Uses 'Rabbi' Title|url = http://www.haaretz.com/jewish/news/1.696921|newspaper = Haaretz|date = 2016-01-12|access-date = 2016-01-17|language = en}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 2015, the [[Rabbinical Council of America]] passed a resolution which states, "RCA members with positions in Orthodox institutions may not ordain women into the Orthodox rabbinate, regardless of the title used; or hire or ratify the hiring of a woman into a rabbinic position at an Orthodox institution; or allow a title implying rabbinic ordination to be used by a teacher of Limudei Kodesh in an Orthodox institution."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jta.org/2015/11/01/news-opinion/united-states/rabbinical-council-of-america-officially-bans-ordination-and-hiring-of-women-rabbis |title=Rabbinical Council of America officially bans ordination and hiring of women rabbis &amp;#124; Jewish Telegraphic Agency |publisher=Jta.org |date=2015 |accessdate=2015-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also in 2015, [[Agudath Israel of America]] denounced moves to ordain women, and went even further, declaring Yeshivat Maharat, [[Open Orthodoxy]], [[Yeshivat Chovevei Torah]], and other affiliated entities to be similar to other dissident movements throughout Jewish history in having rejected basic tenets of Judaism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hamodia.com/2015/11/03/moetzes-open-orthodoxy-not-a-form-of-torah-judaism/|title=Moetzes: 'Open Orthodoxy' Not a Form of Torah Judaism|website=Hamodia}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jpost.com/Diaspora/Breach-in-US-Orthodox-Judaism-grows-as-haredi-body-rejects-Open-Orthodoxy-institutions-431929|title=Breach in US Orthodox Judaism grows as haredi body rejects 'Open Orthodoxy' institutions|website=The Jerusalem Post - JPost.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://forward.com/news/323887/agudath-rabbis-declare-war-on-open-orthodoxy/|title=Avi Weiss Defends 'Open Orthodoxy' as Agudah Rabbis Declare War|author=Josh Nathan-Kazis|date=3 November 2015|website=The Forward}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Avi Weiss has continuously tried to advocate for the right for female clergy to use the rabbi title. In protest of those denying this right to women, Weiss resigned from the [[Rabbinical Council of America]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Rabbi Avi Weiss quits Rabbinical Council of America in protest - Jewish World News|url = http://www.haaretz.com/jewish-world/jewish-world-news/1.663608|accessdate = 2015-06-30|first = |last = JTA}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Newly minted female Orthodox rabbis  to be called 'rabba' - Jewish World News|url = http://www.haaretz.com/jewish-world/jewish-world-news/.premium-1.660857}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = In protest, Avi Weiss quits Rabbinical Council of America|url = http://www.timesofisrael.com/in-protest-avi-weiss-quits-rabbinical-council-of-america/|accessdate = 2015-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Avi Weiss Quits Rabbinic Group in Flap Over School - Breaking News|url = http://forward.com/news/breaking-news/311099/avi-weiss-quits-rabbinic-group-in-flap-over-school/|accessdate = 2015-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2617">In [[mathematics]],  the '''matching distance'''&lt;ref name="dAFrLa06"&gt;Michele d'Amico, Patrizio Frosini, Claudia Landi, ''Using matching distance in Size Theory: a survey'', International Journal of Imaging Systems and Technology, 16(5):154–161, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="dAFrLa10"&gt;Michele d'Amico, Patrizio Frosini, Claudia Landi, ''Natural pseudo-distance and optimal matching between reduced size functions'', Acta Applicandae Mathematicae, 109(2):527-554, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[metric (mathematics)|metric]] on the space of [[size function]]s.

[[Image:DistMatchWiki1.png|thumb|500px|Example: The matching distance between &lt;math&gt;\ell_1=r+a+b&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\ell_2=r'+a'&lt;/math&gt; is given by &lt;math&gt;d_\text{match}(\ell_1, \ell_2)=\max\{\delta(r,r'),\delta(b,a'),\delta(a,\Delta)\}=4&lt;/math&gt;]]

The core of the definition of matching distance is the observation that the
information contained in a size function can be combinatorially stored in a formal series of lines and points of the plane, called respectively ''[[size function|cornerlines]]''  and ''[[size function|cornerpoints]]''.

Given two size functions &lt;math&gt;\ell_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\ell_2&lt;/math&gt;,  let  &lt;math&gt;C_1&lt;/math&gt; (resp. &lt;math&gt;C_2&lt;/math&gt;) be the multiset of
all cornerpoints and cornerlines for &lt;math&gt;\ell_1&lt;/math&gt; (resp. &lt;math&gt;\ell_2&lt;/math&gt;) counted with their
multiplicities, augmented by adding a countable infinity of points  of the
diagonal &lt;math&gt;\{(x,y)\in \R^2: x=y\}&lt;/math&gt;.

The ''matching distance'' between &lt;math&gt;\ell_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\ell_2&lt;/math&gt; is given by
&lt;math&gt;d_\text{match}(\ell_1, \ell_2)=\min_\sigma\max_{p\in C_1}\delta (p,\sigma(p))&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt; varies among all the bijections between &lt;math&gt;C_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;C_2&lt;/math&gt; and

: &lt;math&gt;\delta\left((x,y),(x',y')\right)=\min\left\{\max \{|x-x'|,|y-y'|\}, \max\left\{\frac{y-x}{2},\frac{y'-x'}{2}\right\}\right\}.&lt;/math&gt;

Roughly speaking, the matching distance &lt;math&gt;d_\text{match}&lt;/math&gt;
between two size functions is the minimum, over all the matchings
between the cornerpoints of the two size functions, of the maximum
of the &lt;math&gt;L_\infty&lt;/math&gt;-distances between two matched cornerpoints. Since
two size functions can have a different number of cornerpoints,
these can be also matched to points of the diagonal &lt;math&gt;\Delta&lt;/math&gt;. Moreover, the definition of &lt;math&gt;\delta&lt;/math&gt; implies that matching two points of the diagonal has no cost.

'''''Meaning and Necessity: A Study in Semantics and Modal Logic''''' is a 1947 book about [[logic]] by the philosopher [[Rudolf Carnap]].

==Background==
''Meaning and Necessity'' was the culmination of Carnap's concern with the [[semantics]] of natural and [[formal language]]s, which developed subsequent to his publication of ''The Logical Syntax of Language'' in 1934.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Low05|Lowe 2005]]. pp. 126-127.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Summary==
{{cleanup section||reason=Section is currently based on secondary sources discussing the work. It should be based principally on the book itself|date=June 2018}}
Carnap attempts to develop a new method for analyzing the meanings of linguistic expressions as well as to lay a semantic foundation for modal logic. Carnap maintains that his new method consists in doing away with the traditional assumption that linguistic expressions name concrete or abstract entities and in replacing it with the ascription to them of intensions and extensions. He states that linguistic expressions designate their intensions and extensions: every designation refers to both an intension and an extension.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Aye82|Ayer 1982]]. p. 157.&lt;/ref&gt;

The intensional entities to which individual constants or descriptions, predicates, and declarative sentences are respectively said to refer are individual concepts, properties and propositions, the corresponding extensions being individuals, classes and truth-values. Carnap insists that intensions, including individual concepts, are objectively real, not mental concepts. However, he rejects the charge of hypostatization: individual concepts and properties and propositions must not be considered as things, but this does not prevent them from being genuine objective entities.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Aye82|Ayer 1982]]. p. 157.&lt;/ref&gt;

Carnap's method is an alternative to [[Gottlob Frege]]'s theory of sense and reference, which he refers to as the "method of extension and intension". Carnap holds that his method provides the most economical account of the logical behavior of expressions in modal contexts - for instance, the expressions '9' and '7' in the sentence '9 is necessarily greater than 7.' His criticism of Frege involves a rejection of the traditional category of names, conceived as a class of expressions each of which stands for a unique thing.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Low05|Lowe 2005]]. pp. 126-127.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
''Meaning and Necessity'' was influential, and laid the foundations of much subsequent work in the semantics of [[modal logic]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Low05|Lowe 2005]]. pp. 126-127.&lt;/ref&gt; The work is seen by the British philosopher [[A. J. Ayer]] as the most important of Carnap's three books on semantics, the other two being ''Introduction to Semantics'' (1942) and ''Formalization of Logic'' (1943). Ayer criticizes the book, on the grounds that since, according to Carnap, linguistic expressions designate their intensions and extensions, it is not clear that the difference between Carnap's view and what Carnap calls the traditional assumption that linguistic expressions name concrete or abstract entities is more than nominal.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Aye82|Ayer 1982]]. p. 157.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mill's Methods''' are five methods of [[Inductive reasoning|induction]] described by [[philosopher]] [[John Stuart Mill]] in his 1843 book ''[[A System of Logic]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Churchill |first=Robert Paul |title=Logic: An Introduction |year=1990 |publisher=St. Martin's Press |location=New York |isbn=0-312-02353-7 |oclc=21216829 |edition=2nd |page=418 |quote=In his book ''A System of Logic'' (1843), Mill proposed four methods for testing causal hypotheses: the ''method of agreement'', the ''method of difference'', the ''joint method of agreement and difference'', and the ''method of concomitant variation''.&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt; (footnote 7: Mill also proposed a fifth method, which he called the method of residues.)}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are intended to illuminate issues of [[Causality|causation]].

==The methods==

===Direct method of agreement===
{{quote|text=''If two or more instances of the phenomenon under investigation have only one circumstance in common, the circumstance in which alone all the instances agree, is the cause (or effect) of the given phenomenon. ''|sign=John Stuart Mill|source={{cite book |title=A System of Logic, Vol. 1 |year=1843 |page=454 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=y4MEAAAAQAAJ&amp;vq=method%20of%20agreement&amp;pg=PA454#v=twopage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}}}
For a property to be a [[Necessary and sufficient conditions|necessary]] condition it must always be present if the effect is present. Since this is so, then we are interested in looking at cases where the effect is present and taking note of which properties, among those considered to be 'possible necessary conditions' are present and which are absent. Obviously, any properties which are absent when the effect is present cannot be necessary conditions for the effect. This method is also referred to more generally within comparative politics as the most different systems design.
Symbolically, the method of agreement can be represented as:
: A B C D occur together with w x y z
: A E F G occur together with w t u v
: ——————————————————
: Therefore A is the cause, or the effect, of w.
To further illustrate this concept, consider two structurally different countries. Country A is a former colony, has a centre-left government, and has a federal system with two levels of government. Country B has never been a colony, has a centre-left government and is a unitary state. One factor that both countries have in common, the [[Dependent and independent variables|dependent variable]] in this case, is that they have a system of [[universal health care]]. Comparing the factors known about the countries above, a comparative political scientist would conclude that the government sitting on the centre-left of the spectrum would be the independent variable which causes a system of universal health care, since it is the only one of the factors examined which holds constant between the two countries, and the theoretical backing for that relationship is sound; social democratic (centre-left) policies often include universal health care.

===Method of difference===&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Corroborating evidence]] --&gt;
{{quote|text=''If an instance in which the phenomenon under investigation occurs, and an instance in which it does not occur, have every circumstance save one in common, that one occurring only in the former; the circumstance in which alone the two instances differ, is the effect, or cause, or a necessary part of the cause, of the phenomenon. ''|sign=John Stuart Mill|source={{cite book |title=A System of Logic, Vol. 1 |year=1843 |page=455 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=y4MEAAAAQAAJ&amp;vq=method%20of%20agreement&amp;pg=PA454#v=twopage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}}}

This method is also known more generally as the most similar systems design within comparative politics.

: A B C D occur together with w x y z
: B C D occur together with x y z
: ——————————————————
: Therefore A is the cause, or the effect, or a part of the cause of w.

As an example of the method of difference, consider two similar countries. Country A has a centre-right government, a unitary system and was a former colony. Country B has a centre-right government, a unitary system but was never a colony. The difference between the countries is that Country A readily supports anti-colonial initiatives, whereas Country B does not. The method of difference would identify the independent variable to be the status of each country as a former colony or not, with the dependant variable being support for anti-colonial initiatives. This is because, out of the two similar countries compared, the difference between the two is whether or not they were formerly a colony. This then explains the difference on the values of the dependent variable, with the former colony being more likely to support decolonization than the country with no history of being a colony.

===Joint method of agreement and difference===
{{quote|text=''If two or more instances in which the phenomenon occurs have only one circumstance in common, while two or more instances in which it does not occur have nothing in common save the absence of that circumstance; the circumstance in which alone the two sets of instances differ, is the effect, or cause, or a necessary part of the cause, of the phenomenon. ''|sign=John Stuart Mill|source={{cite book |title=A System of Logic, Vol. 1 |year=1843 |page=463 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=y4MEAAAAQAAJ&amp;vq=method%20of%20agreement&amp;pg=PA462#v=twopage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}}}

Also called simply the "joint method, " this principle simply represents the application of the methods of agreement and difference.

Symbolically, the Joint method of agreement and difference can be represented as:

: A B C occur together with x y z
: A D E occur together with x v w also B C occur with y z
: ——————————————————
: Therefore A is the cause, or the effect, or a part of the cause of x.

===Method of residue===
{{quote|text=''Subduct&lt;ref&gt;"Subduct" is an archaic word meaning "take away" or "subtract".&lt;/ref&gt; from any phenomenon such part as is known by previous inductions to be the effect of certain antecedents, and the residue of the phenomenon is the effect of the remaining antecedents. ''|sign=John Stuart Mill|source={{cite book |title=A System of Logic, Vol. 1 |year=1843 |page=465 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=y4MEAAAAQAAJ&amp;vq=method%20of%20agreement&amp;pg=PA464#v=twopage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}}}

If a range of factors are believed to cause a range of phenomena, and we have matched all the factors, except one, with all the phenomena, except one, then the remaining phenomenon can be attributed to the remaining factor.

Symbolically, the Method of Residue can be represented as:

: A B C occur together with x y z
: B is known to be the cause of y
: C is known to be the cause of z
: ——————————————————
: Therefore A is the cause or effect of x.

===Method of concomitant variations===
{{quote|text=''Whatever phenomenon varies in any manner whenever another phenomenon varies in some particular manner, is either a cause or an effect of that phenomenon, or is connected with it through some fact of causation. ''|sign=John Stuart Mill|source={{cite book |title=A System of Logic, Vol. 1 |year=1843 |page=470 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=y4MEAAAAQAAJ&amp;vq=method%20of%20agreement&amp;pg=PA470#v=twopage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}}}

If across a range of circumstances leading to a phenomenon, some property of the phenomenon varies in tandem with some factor existing in the circumstances, then the phenomenon can be associated with that factor. For instance, suppose that various samples of water, each containing both [[salt]] and [[lead]], were found to be toxic. If the level of toxicity varied in tandem with the level of lead, one could attribute the toxicity to the presence of lead.

Symbolically, the method of concomitant variation can be represented as (with ± representing a shift):

: A B C occur together with x y z
: A± B C results in x± y z.
: —————————————————————
: Therefore A and x are causally connected

Unlike the preceding four inductive methods, the method of concomitant variation doesn't involve the [[Process of elimination|elimination of any circumstance]]. Changing the magnitude of one factor results in the change in the magnitude of another factor.

'''The Mindset List''' is an annual compilation of the values that shape the worldview (or “mindset”) of students about 18 years old and entering college and, to a lesser extent, [[adulthood]]. It is co-authored by Ron Nief, Public Affairs Director Emeritus; Tom McBride, Professor of English and Keefer Professor of Humanities; and Charles Westerberg, Brannon-Ballard Professor of Sociology, all at [[Beloit College]] in [[Beloit, Wisconsin]]. It originated in 1997 as an e-mail forward, without author credits, passed on by then College Statistician Richard Miller to Ron Nief, who passed it on to peers at other schools.  The Mindset List began as a cute way of reminding colleagues on the faculty to "watch their references" with freshmen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Introduction: 2016 List|url=http://www.beloit.edu/mindset/2016/|work=August, 2012|publisher=Beloit College|accessdate=31 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It reappeared in the fall of 1998 after requests from peers who mistook the forward as having originated with Ron Nief. Ever since, Nief and McBride have collaborated to create The List, and Westerberg joined them as a co-author starting with the Class of 2020 List released in 2016.

The List now appears every August as American first-year students enter college. It has been mentioned on the [[NBC Nightly News]] with [[Brian Williams]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/3032619/#32467906&lt;/ref&gt; and an [[essay]] by [[Nancy Gibbs]] of ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1921587,00.html ''What College Students Don't Know''] Time Magazine, September 21, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, ''Time'' declared "mindset list" a new phrase in the [[Americans|American]] [[lexicon]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1917715,00.html ''Verbatim''] Time Magazine, August 31, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

The Mindset List website has a daily quiz about growing up in the United States, a Mindset List Movie of the Month, “Mindset Moments” of reports about the generation gap, links to information about the current generation of young people, and an [[Irony|ironic]] advice column called Ask ROM. The List also appears on Twitter and Facebook.

==Book==
''The Mindset Lists of American History: From Typewriters to Text Messages, What Ten Generations of Americans Think Is Normal'' was released in 2011.

==Criticism==
The website Beloit Mindlessness calls the Mindset List “a poorly written compendium of trivia, stereotypes and lazy generalizations, insulting to both students and their professors, and based on nothing more than the uninformed speculation of its authors. It inspires lazy, inaccurate journalism and is an embarrassment to academia.” Beloit Mindlessness publishes posts critiquing specific items on the Mindset Lists.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.beloitmindlessness.com/]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1950">The '''[[Kiiti Morita|Morita]] conjectures''' in [[general topology]] are certain problems about [[normal space]]s, now solved in the affirmative. They asked 

# If ''X'' &amp;times; ''Y'' is normal for every normal space ''Y'', is ''X'' [[discrete space|discrete]]?
# If ''X'' &amp;times; ''Y'' is normal for every normal P-space ''Y'', is ''X'' [[metrizable]]?&lt;ref&gt;[[Kiiti Morita|K. Morita]], "Some problems on normality of products of spaces"  J. Novák (ed.) , Proc. Fourth Prague Topological Symp. (Prague, August 1976) , Soc. Czech. Math. and Physicists , Prague  (1977)  pp. 296–297&lt;/ref&gt;
# If ''X'' &amp;times; ''Y'' is normal for every normal countably [[paracompact]] space ''Y'', is ''X'' metrizable and [[sigma-locally compact]]?

The answers were believed to be affirmative. Here a '''normal P-space''' ''Y'' is characterised by the property that the product with every metrizable ''X'' is normal; thus the conjecture was that the converse holds.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20831">In the [[foundations of mathematics]], '''Morse–Kelley set theory''' ('''MK'''), '''Kelley–Morse set theory''' ('''KM'''), '''Morse–Tarski set theory''' ('''MT'''), '''Quine–Morse set theory''' ('''QM''') or the '''system of Quine and Morse''' is a [[first order logic|first order]] [[axiomatic set theory]] that is closely related to [[von Neumann–Bernays–Gödel set theory]] (NBG). While von Neumann–Bernays–Gödel set theory restricts the [[bound variable]]s in the schematic formula appearing in the [[axiom schema]] of [[axiom schema of Class Comprehension|Class Comprehension]] to range over sets alone, Morse–Kelley set theory allows these bound variables to range over [[proper class]]es as well as sets, as first suggested by Quine in 1940 for his system [[New Foundations|ML]].

Morse–Kelley set theory is named after mathematicians [[John L. Kelley]] and [[Anthony Morse]] and was first set out by {{harvtxt|Wang|1949}} and later in an appendix to Kelley's textbook ''General Topology'' (1955), a graduate level introduction to [[topology]]. Kelley said the system in his book was a variant of the systems due to [[Thoralf Skolem]] and Morse. Morse's own version appeared later in his book ''A Theory of Sets'' (1965).

While von Neumann–Bernays–Gödel set theory is a [[conservative extension]] of [[Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory]] (ZFC, the canonical set theory) in the sense that a statement in the language of ZFC is provable in NBG if and only if it is provable in ZFC, Morse–Kelley set theory is a [[proper extension]] of ZFC. Unlike von Neumann–Bernays–Gödel set theory, where the axiom schema of Class Comprehension can be replaced with finitely many of its instances, Morse–Kelley set theory cannot be finitely axiomatized.

== MK axioms and ontology ==
[[Von Neumann–Bernays–Gödel set theory|NBG]] and MK share a common [[ontology]]. The [[universe of discourse]] consists of [[proper class|classes]]. Classes which are members of other classes are called [[Set (mathematics)|sets]]. A class which is not a set is a [[proper class]]. The primitive [[atomic sentence]]s involve membership or equality.

With the exception of Class Comprehension, the following axioms are the same as those for [[Von Neumann–Bernays–Gödel set theory|NBG]], inessential details aside. The symbolic versions of the axioms employ the following notational devices:
* The upper case letters other than ''M'', appearing in Extensionality, Class Comprehension, and Foundation, denote variables ranging over classes. A lower case letter denotes a variable that cannot be a [[proper class]], because it appears to the left of an ∈. As MK is a one-sorted theory, this notational convention is only [[mnemonic]].
* The [[Unary operation|monadic]] [[predicate (mathematical logic)|predicate]] &lt;math&gt;\ Mx,&lt;/math&gt; whose intended reading is "the class ''x'' is a set", abbreviates &lt;math&gt;\exists W(x \in W).&lt;/math&gt;
* The [[empty set]] &lt;math&gt;\varnothing&lt;/math&gt; is defined by &lt;math&gt;\forall x (x \not \in \varnothing).&lt;/math&gt;
* The class ''V'', the [[universe (mathematics)|universal class]] having all possible sets as members, is defined by &lt;math&gt;\forall x (Mx \to x \in V).&lt;/math&gt; ''V'' is also the [[Von Neumann universe]].

'''[[Axiom of extensionality|Extensionality]]:''' Classes having the same members are the same class.
:&lt;math&gt;\forall X \, \forall Y \, ( \forall z \, (z \in X \leftrightarrow z \in Y) \rightarrow X = Y).&lt;/math&gt;
A set and a class having the same extension are identical. Hence MK is not a two-sorted theory, appearances to the contrary notwithstanding.

'''[[Axiom of foundation|Foundation]]:''' Each nonempty class ''A'' is [[disjoint sets|disjoint]] from at least one of its members.
:&lt;math&gt;\forall A [A \not = \varnothing \rightarrow \exists b (b \in A \land \forall c (c \in b \rightarrow c \not\in A))].&lt;/math&gt;

'''Class Comprehension:''' Let φ(''x'') be any formula in the language of MK in which ''x'' is a [[free variable]] and ''Y'' is not free. φ(''x'') may contain parameters which are either sets or proper classes. More consequentially, the quantified variables in φ(''x'') may range over all classes and not just over all sets; ''this is the only way MK differs from [[Von Neumann–Bernays–Gödel set theory|NBG]]''. Then there exists a '''class''' &lt;math&gt;Y=\{x \mid \phi(x)\}&lt;/math&gt; whose members are exactly those '''sets''' ''x'' such that &lt;math&gt;\phi(x)&lt;/math&gt; comes out true. Formally, if ''Y'' is not free in φ:
:&lt;math&gt;\forall W_1 ... W_n \exists Y \forall x [x \in Y \leftrightarrow (\phi(x, W_1, ... W_n) \land Mx)].&lt;/math&gt;

'''[[Axiom of pairing|Pairing]]:''' For any sets ''x'' and ''y'', there exists a set &lt;math&gt;z=\{x,y\}&lt;/math&gt; whose members are exactly ''x'' and ''y''.
:&lt;math&gt;\forall x \, \forall y \, [ (Mx \land My) \rightarrow \exists z \, (Mz \land \forall s \, [ s \in z \leftrightarrow (s = x \, \lor \, s = y)])].&lt;/math&gt;

Pairing licenses the unordered pair in terms of which the [[ordered pair]], &lt;math&gt;\langle x,y \rangle&lt;/math&gt;, may be defined in the usual way, as &lt;math&gt;\ \{\{x\},\{x,y\}\}&lt;/math&gt;. With ordered pairs in hand, Class Comprehension enables defining [[relation (mathematics)|relations]] and [[function (set theory)|functions]] on sets as sets of ordered pairs, making possible the next axiom:

'''[[Axiom of limitation of size|Limitation of Size]]:''' ''C'' is a [[proper class]] if and only if ''[[Von Neumann universe|V]]'' can be [[one-to-one mapping|mapped one-to-one]] into ''C''.
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{array}{l}
\forall C [\lnot MC \leftrightarrow \exists F ( \forall x [Mx \rightarrow \exists s (s \in C \land \langle x, s \rangle \in F)] \land \\
\qquad \forall x \forall y \forall s [(\langle x, s \rangle \in F \land \langle y, s \rangle \in F) \rightarrow x = y])].
\end{array}&lt;/math&gt;

The formal version of this axiom resembles the [[axiom schema of replacement]], and embodies the class function ''F''. The next section explains how Limitation of Size is stronger than the usual forms of the [[axiom of choice]].

'''[[Axiom of power set|Power set]]:''' Let ''p'' be a class whose members are all possible [[subset]]s of the set ''a''. Then ''p'' is a set.
:&lt;math&gt;\forall a \, \forall p \, [(Ma \land \forall x \, [x \in p \leftrightarrow \forall y \, (y \in x \rightarrow y \in a)]) \rightarrow Mp].&lt;/math&gt;

'''[[Axiom of union|Union]]:''' Let &lt;math&gt;s=\bigcup a&lt;/math&gt; be the sum class of the set ''a'', namely the [[union (set theory)|union]] of all members of ''a''. Then ''s'' is a set.
:&lt;math&gt;\forall a \, \forall s \, [(Ma \land \forall x \, [x \in s \leftrightarrow \exists y \, (x \in y \land y \in a)]) \rightarrow Ms].&lt;/math&gt;

'''[[axiom of infinity|Infinity]]:''' There exists an inductive set ''y'', meaning that (i) the [[empty set]] is a member of ''y''; (ii) if ''x'' is a member of ''y'', then so is &lt;math&gt;x \cup \{x\}.&lt;/math&gt;.
:&lt;math&gt;\exists y[My \land \varnothing \in y \land \forall z(z \in y \rightarrow \exists x [x \in y \land \forall w (w \in x \leftrightarrow [w = z \lor w \in z])] )].&lt;/math&gt;

Note that ''p'' and ''s'' in Power Set and Union are universally, not existentially, quantified, as Class Comprehension suffices to establish the existence of ''p'' and ''s''. Power Set and Union only serve to establish that ''p'' and ''s'' cannot be proper classes.

The above axioms are shared with other set theories as follows:
* [[Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory|ZFC]] and [[Von Neumann–Bernays–Gödel set theory|NBG]]: Pairing, Power Set, Union, Infinity;
* [[Von Neumann–Bernays–Gödel set theory|NBG]] (and ZFC, if quantified variables were restricted to sets): Extensionality, Foundation;
* [[Von Neumann–Bernays–Gödel set theory|NBG]]: Limitation of Size.

== Discussion ==
Monk (1980) and Rubin (1967) are set theory texts built around MK; Rubin's [[ontology]] includes [[urelement]]s. These authors and Mendelson (1997: 287) submit that MK does what is expected of a set theory while being less cumbersome than [[Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory|ZFC]] and [[Von Neumann–Bernays–Gödel set theory|NBG]].

MK is strictly stronger than ZFC and its [[conservative extension]] NBG, the other well-known set theory with [[proper class]]es. In fact, NBG—and hence ZFC—can be proved consistent in MK. MK's strength stems from its axiom schema of Class Comprehension being [[impredicativity|impredicative]], meaning that φ(''x'') may contain quantified variables ranging over classes. The quantified variables in NBG's axiom schema of Class Comprehension are restricted to sets; hence Class Comprehension in NBG must be [[impredicativity|predicative]]. (Separation with respect to sets is still impredicative in NBG, because the quantifiers in φ(''x'') may range over all sets.) The NBG axiom schema of Class Comprehension can be replaced with finitely many of its instances; this is not possible in MK. MK is consistent relative to ZFC augmented by an axiom asserting the existence of strongly [[inaccessible cardinal]]s.

The only advantage of the [[axiom of limitation of size]] is that it implies the [[axiom of global choice]]. Limitation of Size does not appear in Rubin (1967), Monk (1980), or Mendelson (1997). Instead, these authors invoke a usual form of the local [[axiom of choice]], and an "axiom of replacement,"&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., Mendelson (1997), p. 239, axiom R.&lt;/ref&gt; asserting that if the [[domain (mathematics)|domain]] of a class function is a set, its [[range (mathematics)|range]] is also a set. Replacement can prove everything that Limitation of Size proves, except prove some form of the [[axiom of choice]].

[[axiom of limitation of size|Limitation of Size]] plus [[axiom of infinity|''I'' being a set]] (hence the universe is nonempty) renders provable the sethood of the empty set; hence no need for an [[axiom of empty set]]. Such an axiom could be added, of course, and minor perturbations of the above axioms would necessitate this addition. The set ''I'' is not identified with the [[limit ordinal]] &lt;math&gt;\omega,&lt;/math&gt; as ''I'' could be a set larger than &lt;math&gt;\omega.&lt;/math&gt; In this case, the existence of &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt; would follow from either form of Limitation of Size.

The class of [[von Neumann ordinal]]s can be [[well-order]]ed. It cannot be a set (under pain of paradox); hence that class is a proper class, and all proper classes have the same size as ''V''. Hence ''V'' too can be well-ordered.

MK can be confused with second-order ZFC, ZFC with [[second-order logic]] (representing second-order objects in set rather than predicate language) as its background logic. The language of second-order ZFC is similar to that of MK (although a set and a class having the same extension can no longer be identified), and their [[syntax|syntactical]] resources for practical proof are almost identical (and are identical if MK includes the strong form of Limitation of Size). But the [[semantics]] of second-order ZFC are quite different from those of MK. For example, if MK is consistent then it has a countable first-order model, while second-order ZFC has no countable models.

=== Model theory ===
ZFC, NBG, and MK each have models describable in terms of ''V'', the [[inner model|standard model]] of [[Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory|ZFC]] and the [[von Neumann universe]]. Let the [[inaccessible cardinal]] κ be a member of ''V''. Also let Def(''X'') denote the Δ&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; definable [[subset]]s of ''X'' (see [[constructible universe]]). Then:
* ''V''&lt;sub&gt;κ&lt;/sub&gt; is an [[intended interpretation|intended model]] of [[Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory|ZFC]];
* Def(''V''&lt;sub&gt;κ&lt;/sub&gt;) is an intended model of Mendelson's version of [[Von Neumann–Bernays–Gödel set theory|NBG]] which excludes global choice, replacing limitation of size by replacement and ordinary choice;
* ''V''&lt;sub&gt;κ+1&lt;/sub&gt;, the [[power set]] of ''V''&lt;sub&gt;κ&lt;/sub&gt;, is an intended model of MK.

=== History ===
MK was first set out in {{harvtxt|Wang|1949}} and popularized in an appendix to [[J. L. Kelley]]'s (1955) ''General Topology'', using the axioms given in the next section. The system of Anthony Morse's (1965) ''A Theory of Sets'' is equivalent to Kelley's, but formulated in an idiosyncratic formal language rather than, as is done here, in standard [[first order logic]].  The first set theory to include [[impredicative]] class comprehension was [[W. V. Quine|Quine's]] [[New Foundations|ML]], that built on [[New Foundations]] rather than on [[Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory|ZFC]].&lt;ref&gt;The ''locus citandum'' for ML is the 1951 ed. of [[W. V. O. Quine|Quine's]] ''Mathematical Logic''. However, the summary of ML given in Mendelson (1997), p. 296, is easier to follow. Mendelson's axiom schema ML2 is identical to the above axiom schema of Class Comprehension.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Impredicative]] class comprehension was also proposed in [[Mostowski]] (1951) and [[David Kellogg Lewis|Lewis]] (1991).

== The axioms in Kelley's ''General topology'' ==
The axioms and definitions in this section are, but for a few inessential details, taken from the Appendix to Kelley (1955). The explanatory remarks below are not his. The Appendix states 181 theorems and definitions, and warrants careful reading as an abbreviated exposition of axiomatic set theory by a working mathematician of the first rank. Kelley introduced his axioms gradually, as needed to develop the topics listed after each instance of ''Develop'' below.

Notations appearing below and now well-known are not defined. Peculiarities of Kelley's notation include:
* He did ''not'' distinguish variables ranging over classes from those ranging over sets;
* ''domain f'' and ''range f'' denote the domain and range of the function ''f''; this peculiarity has been carefully respected below;
* His primitive logical language includes [[set builder notation|class abstract]]s of the form &lt;math&gt;\ \{x : A(x)\},&lt;/math&gt; "the class of all sets ''x'' satisfying ''A''(''x'')."

'''Definition:''' ''x'' is a ''set'' (and hence not a [[proper class]]) if, for some ''y'', &lt;math&gt;x \in y&lt;/math&gt;.

'''I. Extent:''' For each ''x'' and each ''y'', ''x=y'' if and only if for each ''z'', &lt;math&gt;z \in x&lt;/math&gt; when and only when &lt;math&gt;z \in y.&lt;/math&gt;

Identical to ''Extensionality'' above. '''I''' would be identical to the [[axiom of extensionality]] in [[ZFC]], except that the scope of '''I''' includes proper classes as well as sets.

'''II. Classification (schema):''' An axiom results if in
: For each &lt;math&gt; \beta&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\beta \in \{\alpha:A\}&lt;/math&gt; if and only if &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt; is a set and &lt;math&gt;B,&lt;/math&gt;
'α' and 'β' are replaced by variables, ' ''A'' ' by a formula Æ, and ' ''B'' ' by the formula obtained from Æ by replacing each occurrence of the variable which replaced α by the variable which replaced β provided that the variable which replaced β does not appear bound in ''A''.

''Develop'': Boolean [[algebra of sets]]. Existence of the [[empty set|null class]] and of the universal class ''V''.

'''III. Subsets:'''  If ''x'' is a set, there exists a set ''y'' such that for each ''z'', if &lt;math&gt;z \subseteq x&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;z \in y.&lt;/math&gt;

The import of '''III''' is that of ''Power Set'' above. Sketch of the proof of Power Set from '''III''': for any ''class'' ''z'' which is a subclass of the set ''x'', the class ''z'' is a member of the set ''y'' whose existence '''III''' asserts. Hence ''z'' is a set.

''Develop'': ''V'' is not a set. Existence of [[singleton (mathematics)|singleton]]s. [[axiom of separation|Separation]] provable.

'''IV. Union:''' If ''x'' and ''y'' are both sets, then &lt;math&gt;x \cup y&lt;/math&gt; is a set.

The import of '''IV''' is that of ''Pairing'' above. Sketch of the proof of Pairing from '''IV''': the singleton &lt;math&gt;\{x\}&lt;/math&gt; of a set ''x'' is a set because it is a subclass of the power set of ''x'' (by two applications of '''III'''). Then '''IV''' implies that &lt;math&gt;\{x,y\}&lt;/math&gt; is a set if ''x'' and ''y'' are sets.

''Develop'': Unordered and [[ordered pair]]s, [[relation (mathematics)|relations]], [[function (set theory)|function]]s, [[domain (mathematics)|domain]], [[range (mathematics)|range]], [[function composition]].

'''V. Substitution:''' If ''f'' is a [class] function and ''domain f'' is a set, then ''range f'' is a set.

The import of '''V''' is that of the [[axiom schema of replacement]] in [[Von Neumann–Bernays–Gödel set theory|NBG]] and [[ZFC]].

'''VI. Amalgamation:''' If ''x'' is a set, then &lt;math&gt;\bigcup x&lt;/math&gt; is a set.

The import of '''VI''' is that of ''Union'' above. '''IV''' and '''VI''' may be combined into one axiom.&lt;ref&gt;Kelley (1955), p. 261, fn †.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Develop'': [[Cartesian product]], [[injective function|injection]], [[surjection]], [[bijection]], [[order theory]].

'''VII. Regularity:''' If &lt;math&gt;x \neq \varnothing&lt;/math&gt; there is a member ''y'' of ''x'' such that &lt;math&gt;x \cap y = \varnothing.&lt;/math&gt;

The import of '''VII''' is that of ''Foundation'' above.

''Develop'': [[Ordinal number]]s, [[transfinite induction]].

'''VIII. Infinity:''' There exists a set ''y'', such that &lt;math&gt;\varnothing \in y&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;x \cup \{x\} \in y&lt;/math&gt; whenever &lt;math&gt;x \in y.&lt;/math&gt;

This axiom, or equivalents thereto, are included in ZFC and NBG. '''VIII''' asserts the unconditional existence of two sets, the [[infinite set|infinite]] inductive set ''y'', and the null set &lt;math&gt;\varnothing.&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;\varnothing&lt;/math&gt; is a set simply because it is a member of ''y''. Up to this point, everything that has been proved to exist is a class, and Kelley's discussion of sets was entirely hypothetical.

''Develop'':  [[Natural number]]s, '''N''' is a set, [[Peano axioms]], [[integer]]s, [[rational number]]s, [[real number]]s.

'''Definition:''' ''c'' is a ''choice function'' if ''c'' is a function and &lt;math&gt;c(x) \in x&lt;/math&gt; for each member ''x'' of ''domain c''.

'''IX. Choice:''' There exists a choice function ''c'' whose domain is &lt;math&gt;V - \{\varnothing\}.&lt;/math&gt;.

'''IX''' is very similar to the [[axiom of global choice]] derivable from ''Limitation of Size'' above.

''Develop'': [[axiom of choice#Equivalents|Equivalents]] of the axiom of choice. As is the case with [[Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory|ZFC]], the development of the [[cardinal number]]s requires some form of Choice.

If the scope of all quantified variables in the above axioms is restricted to sets, all axioms except '''III''' and the schema '''IV''' are ZFC axioms. '''IV''' is provable in ZFC. Hence the Kelley treatment of '''MK''' makes very clear that all that distinguishes '''MK''' from ZFC are variables ranging over [[proper class]]es as well as sets, and the Classification schema.

In [[mathematics]], a '''multiplication table''' (sometimes, less formally, a '''times table''') is a [[mathematical table]] used to define a [[multiplication]] [[binary operation|operation]] for an algebraic system.

The [[decimal]] multiplication table was traditionally taught as an essential part of elementary arithmetic around the world, as it lays the foundation for arithmetic operations with base-ten numbers. Many educators believe it is necessary to memorize the table up to 9 × 9.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|journal=For the Learning of Mathematics|volume=1|issue=1|year=1980|title=The Multiplication Table: To Be Memorized or Mastered!|first=John|last=Trivett|pages=21–25|jstor= 40247697}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The multiplication table is sometimes attributed to the ancient Greek mathematician [[Pythagoras]] (570–495&amp;nbsp;BC). It is also called the Table of Pythagoras in many languages (for example French, Italian and at one point even Russian), sometimes in English.&lt;ref&gt;for example in [https://books.google.com/books?id=TBBKAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA17&amp;lpg=PA17&amp;dq=%22table+of+pythagoras%22+-Montessori&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=TaXIEXCAic&amp;sig=KiblQIMaPnnwRp-R0eW6CSEQUUk&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=IltFTezaDJH2sgatovGnDg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CCcQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=%22table%20of%20pythagoras%22%20-Montessori&amp;f=false ''An Elementary Treatise on Arithmetic'' by [[John Farrar (scientist)|John Farrar]]]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Greco-Roman]] mathematician [[Nichomachus]] (60–120&amp;nbsp;AD), a follower of [[Neopythagoreanism]], included a multiplication table in his ''[[Introduction to Arithmetic]]'', whereas the oldest surviving [[Greek mathematics|Greek]] multiplication table is on a wax tablet dated to the 1st century AD and currently housed in the [[British Museum]].&lt;ref&gt;David E. Smith (1958), ''History of Mathematics, Volume I: General Survey of the History of Elementary Mathematics''. New York: Dover Publications (a reprint of the 1951 publication), {{isbn|0-486-20429-4}}, pp. 58, 129.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 493&amp;nbsp;AD, [[Victorius of Aquitaine]] wrote a 98-column multiplication table which gave (in [[Roman numerals]]) the product of every number from 2 to 50 times and the rows were "a list of numbers starting with one thousand, descending by hundreds to one hundred, then descending by tens to ten, then by ones to one, and then the fractions down to 1/144."&lt;ref&gt;David W. Maher and John F. Makowski. "Literary evidence for Roman arithmetic with fractions". ''Classical Philology'', 96/4 (October 2001), p. 383.&lt;/ref&gt;

In his 1820 book ''The Philosophy of Arithmetic'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Leslie |first=John |year=1820 |title=The Philosophy of Arithmetic; Exhibiting a Progressive View of the Theory and Practice of Calculation, with Tables for the Multiplication of Numbers as Far as One Thousand |publisher=Abernethy &amp; Walker |location=Edinburgh}}&lt;/ref&gt; mathematician [[John Leslie (physicist)|John Leslie]] published a multiplication table up to 99 × 99, which allows numbers to be multiplied in pairs of digits at a time.  Leslie also recommended that young pupils memorize the multiplication table up to 25 × 25. The illustration below shows a table up to 12 × 12, which is a size commonly used in schools.

The traditional rote learning of multiplication was based on memorization of columns in the table, in a form like
{{div col|colwidth=30em}}
&lt;poem&gt;
   1 × 10 = 10
   2 × 10 = 20
   3 × 10 = 30
   4 × 10 = 40
   5 × 10 = 50
   6 × 10 = 60
   7 × 10 = 70
   8 × 10 = 80
   9 × 10 = 90
&lt;/poem&gt;
{{div col end}}

This form of writing the multiplication table in columns with complete number sentences is still used in some countries, such as Bosnia and Herzegovina,{{citation needed|date=December 2016}} instead of the modern grid above.

==Patterns in the tables==
There is a pattern in the multiplication table that can help people to memorize the table more easily. It uses the figures below:
&lt;!--
      →                 →
    1 2 3             2   4
 ↑  4 5 6 ↓         ↑       ↓
    7 8 9             6   8
      ←                 ←
      0                 0

Figure 1 is used for multiples of 1, 3, 7, and 9. Figure 2 is used for the multiples of 2, 4, 6, and 8. These patterns can be used to memorize the multiples of any number from 0 to 10, except 5. As you would start on the number you are multiplying, when you multiply by 0, you stay on 0 (0 is external and so the arrows have no effect on 0, otherwise 0 is used as a link to create a perpetual cycle). The pattern also works with multiples of 10, by starting at 1 and simply adding 0, giving you 10, then just apply every number in the pattern to the "tens" unit as you would normally do as usual to the "ones" unit.

[[File:Multiplication_mnemonic_7.svg|thumb|120px|Using the mnemonic to recall multiples of 7]]
For example, to recall all the multiples of 7:

# Look at the 7 in the first picture and follow the arrow.
# The next number in the direction of the arrow is 4. So think of the next number after 7 that ends with 4, which is 14.
# The next number in the direction of the arrow is 1. So think of the next number after 14 that ends with 1, which is 21.
# After coming to the top of this column, start with the bottom of the next column, and travel in the same direction. The number is 8. So think of the next number after 21 that ends with 8, which is 28.
# Proceed in the same way until the last number, 3, corresponding to 63.
# Next, use the 0 at the bottom. It corresponds to 70.
# Then, start again with the 7.  This time it will correspond to 77.
# Continue like this.

==In abstract algebra==
Tables can also define binary operations on [[group (mathematics)|group]]s, [[field (mathematics)|field]]s, [[ring (mathematics)|ring]]s, and other [[Abstract algebra|algebraic systems]]. In such contexts they can be called [[Cayley table]]s. Here are the addition and multiplication tables for the [[finite field]] '''Z&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;'''.

For every natural number ''n'', there are also addition and multiplication tables for the ring '''Z&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;'''.

==Chinese multiplication table==
{{Main|Chinese multiplication table}}
The Chinese multiplication table consists of eighty-one sentences with four or five Chinese characters per sentence, making it easy for children to learn by heart. A shorter version of the table consists of only forty-five sentences, as terms such as "nine eights beget seventy-two" are identical to "eight nines beget seventy-two" so there is no need to learn them twice.

==Standards-based mathematics reform in the US==
In 1989, the [[National Council of Teachers of Mathematics]] (NCTM) developed new standards which were based on the belief that all students should learn higher-order thinking skills, and which recommended reduced emphasis on the teaching of traditional methods that relied on rote memorization, such as multiplication tables. Widely adopted texts such as [[Investigations in Numbers, Data, and Space]] (widely known as [[Technical Education Research Centers|TERC]] after its producer, Technical Education Research Centers) omitted aids such as multiplication tables in early editions. NCTM made it clear in their 2006 [[Principles and Standards for School Mathematics#Curriculum Focal Points|Focal Points]] that basic mathematics facts must be learned, though there is no consensus on whether rote memorization is the best method.

[[File:Richard Everitt from family photo album.jpg|thumb|Richard Everitt]]
On 13 August 1994, 15-year-old '''Richard Everitt''' was stabbed to death in [[London]] in a racially motivated attack. Everitt's neighbourhood, [[Somers Town, London|Somers Town]], had been the site of ethnic tensions, and although he was not involved in gangs, he was murdered by a gang of [[British Bangladeshi]]s who were seeking revenge on another [[White British]] boy. 

The murderer was not apprehended, as members of the gang fled to Bangladesh. Badrul Miah and Showat Akbar were tried in 1995 as the ringleaders of the gang and were given life sentences, with minimum terms of 12 years and three years in custody respectively.

==Background==
Somers Town, in the [[London Borough of Camden]], was experiencing [[urban decay]] in the early 1990s. Many of its white families had been moved onto newer estates, and the ones who remained lived in poverty and unemployment, and felt in conflict with Bengalis. Bengalis were living in the neighbourhood's worst housing, with problems of overcrowding due to their larger-than-average families.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Malik|first1=Kenan|title=Somers Town: where lessons go unlearnt|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/somers-town-where-lessons-go-unlearnt-1384872.html|accessdate=14 October 2015|work=The Independent|date=21 August 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;

White youths and Bengali youths respectively chose to attend different schools and youth clubs, and interracial relationships were shunned.&lt;ref name=indy1&gt;{{cite news|last1=Braid|first1=Mary|title=Fear and loathing after 'racial' murder: Gangs of teenagers have vowed to avenge the death of a white schoolboy stabbed by a group of Asians in Somers Town, north London, on Saturday.

Richard Everitt attended [[South Camden Community School (SCCS)|South Camden Community School]], where the ethnic tensions continued, although he was not involved in them. His mother had previously complained when he was allegedly threatened with a knife by an Asian pupil.&lt;ref name=indy1/&gt;

==Murder==
On the night of 13 August 1994, Everitt returned from playing football to ask for permission to go to [[Burger King]] with his friends. They encountered a gang of fifteen Bengali youths aged 18–19 and began to run, but Everitt was caught and stabbed with a seven-inch kitchen knife in his shoulder blades, piercing his heart. His friends notified his parents, who came to him as he was loaded into the ambulance. Everitt died at the hospital.&lt;ref name=mirror&gt;{{cite news|last1=McCaffrey|first1=Julie|title=Exclusive: I can't forgive my son's knife crime killer|url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/lifestyle/family/exclusive-i-cant-forgive-my-sons-knife-347352|accessdate=14 October 2015|work=[[Daily Mirror]]|date=13 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal proceedings==
Eleven men were arrested and [[bail]]ed shortly after Everitt was stabbed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=MacKinnon|first1=Ian|title=Race motive suspected in murder of white boy: Friends find teenager stabbed in street|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/race-motive-suspected-in-murder-of-white-boy-friends-find-teenager-stabbed-in-street-1383575.html|accessdate=14 October 2015|work=The Independent|date=23 October 2011 |origyear= 14 August 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The trial began on 5 October 1995 at the [[Old Bailey]]. On 1 November, Badrul Miah was found guilty of conspiring to murder Everitt and was given a 'life' sentence with a minimum of 12 years in prison; Showat Akbar was found guilty of violent disorder and sentenced to three years' youth detention. Their gang had been seeking revenge on a white teenager suspected of stealing their jewellery, and Miah boasted that he had "stabbed up a white boy". Miah and Akbar were deemed by the judge to have been the ringleaders of the attack, but she stated that the identity of the killer was unknown as some of the gang members had fled to Bangladesh.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=McKie|first1=John|title=Gang leader gets life for killing boy|work=The Independent|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/gang-leader-gets-life-for-killing-boy-1536715.html|accessdate=14 October 2015|date=1 November 1995}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, Miah was given four days' unsupervised release to attend his sister's wedding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Race killer freed for party|url=http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/news/44051/Race-killer-freed-for-party.html|accessdate=14 October 2015|work=[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath==
Everitt's murder was received with shock in Somers Town. A Bengali teenager told ''[[The Independent]]'' "The boy seems to have had nothing to do with trouble. We are so shocked that Bengali boys could do this. It is the innocent increasingly who are suffering".&lt;ref name=indy1/&gt; The Deputy Headmaster of Everitt's school told the press that cohesion was generally good at the school.&lt;ref name=indy1/&gt; Jalal Uddin, a Bengali activist, spoke of his fears that revenge attacks could continue perpetually.&lt;ref name=news/

A [[Halal]] butcher's was firebombed, and white gangs attacked Bengalis.&lt;ref name=indy2&gt;{{cite news|last1=Malik|first1=Kenan|title=Somers Town: where lessons go unlearnt|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/somers-town-where-lessons-go-unlearnt-1384872.html|accessdate=14 October 2015|work=The Independent|date=21 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bengalis told family members to stay indoors, and the police increased their presence in order to combat the gangs.&lt;ref name=indy1/&gt; A white gang member said that he would not accept support from the [[British National Party]] because "the BNP comes down here, gets everyone whipped up and then when the trouble starts we get it and they run away".&lt;ref name=indy1/&gt;

After the convictions, Everitt's family were abused by Bengali neighbours, and moved to [[Essex]] before settling in [[Haworth]], [[West Yorkshire]]. His mother successfully campaigned for stronger sentences for [[knife legislation|knife crime]].&lt;ref name=mirror/&gt;

The murder was mentioned by ''[[India Today]]'' as attributable to a decline in values among [[British Asian]] youth, who were previously considered a [[model minority]] but were becoming increasingly involved with drugs and gangs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Merchant|first1=Khozem|title=Immigrant gangland|url=http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/asian-youths-turn-to-drugs-gangs-and-crime-in-london/1/294235.html|accessdate=14 October 2015|work=[[India Today]]|date=15 October 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
In response to Everitt's murder, the KXL Camden United project was founded using football to bring young people together. The football team is for players aged 15 to 19.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/special_events/sport_relief/2122579.stm|title=BBC SPORT - Sport Relief - Community team scores a winner|website=news.bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Socialist Workers Party (UK)|Socialist Workers Party]] activist Alan Walter launched Camden Action Now alongside Everitt's parents, offering youth activities and aiming to unite the community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/society/2009/mar/16/alan-walter-obituary|title=Alan Walter|first=Austin|last=Mitchell|date=16 March 2009|publisher=|via=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7992">In children, '''narcissistic withdrawal''' may be described as 'a form of [[omnipotent]] [[narcissism]] characterised by the turning away from parental figures and by the fantasy that essential needs can be satisfied by the individual alone'.&lt;ref&gt;Margaret Rustin, ''Psychotic States in Children'' (1997) p. 17&lt;/ref&gt;

For adults, 'in the contemporary literature the term narcissistic withdrawal is instead reserved for an ego defense in pathological personalities'.&lt;ref name=Myquel&gt;[http://www.enotes.com/psychoanalysis-encyclopedia/narcissistic-withdrawal Martine Myquel, "Narcissistic Withdrawal"]&lt;/ref&gt; Such narcissists may feel obliged to withdraw from any relationship that threatens to be more than short-term.

==Psychoanalysis==

[[Freud]] used the term 'to describe the turning back of the individual's libido from the object onto themselves....as the equivalent of narcissistic [[Regression (psychology)|regression]]'.&lt;ref name=Myquel/&gt; [[On Narcissism]] saw him explore the idea through an examination of such everyday events as illness or sleep: 'the condition of sleep, too, resembles illness in implying a narcissistic withdrawal of the positions of the [[libido]] on to the subject's own self'.&lt;ref&gt;Sigmund Freud, ''On Metapsychology'' (PFL 11) p. 76&lt;/ref&gt; A few years later, in '"Mourning and Melancholia"...Freud's most profound contribution to [[object relations theory]]',&lt;ref&gt;James Grotstein, in [[Neville Symington]], ''Narcissism: A New Theory'' (London 2003) p. xi&lt;/ref&gt; he examined how 'a withdrawal of the libido...on a narcissistic basis' in [[major depressive disorder|depression]] could allow both a freezing and a preservation of affection: 'by taking flight into the ego love escapes extinction'.&lt;ref&gt;Freud, ''Metapsychology'' p. 57-8 and p. 267&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Otto Fenichel]] would extend his analysis to [[Borderline personality disorder|borderline]] conditions, demonstrating how 'in a reactive withdrawal of libido...a regression to narcissism is also a regression to the primal narcissistic omnipotence which makes its reappearance in the form of [[megalomania]]'.&lt;ref&gt;Otto Fenichel, ''The Psychoanalytic Theory of Neurosis'' (London 1946) p. 419-20&lt;/ref&gt;

For [[Melanie Klein]], however, a more positive element came to the fore: 'frustration, which stimulates narcissistic withdrawal, is also...a fundamental factor in adaptation to reality'.&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Pearl King/Riccardo Steiner, ''The Freud-Klein Controversies'' (1992) p. 802&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, '[[D. W. Winnicott|Winnicott]] points out that there is an aspect of withdrawal that is healthy', considering that it might be '"helpful to think of withdrawal as a condition in which the person concerned (child or adult) holds a regressed part of the self and nurses it, at the expense of external relationships"'.&lt;ref&gt;J. Abram/K. Hjulmand, ''The Language of Winnicott'' (2007) p. 45 and p. 293&lt;/ref&gt;

However, from the mid-20th century onwards, attention has increasingly focused on 'the case in which the subject appeals to narcissistic withdrawal as a defensive solution...a precarious refuge that comes into being as a defense against a disappointing or untrustworthy object. This is found in studies of narcissistic personalities or borderline pathologies by authors such as [[Heinz Kohut]] or [[Otto Kernberg]]'.&lt;ref name=Myquel/&gt;

Kohut considered that 'the narcissistically vulnerable individual responds to actual (or anticipated) [[narcissistic injury]] either with shamefaced withdrawal or with narcissistic rage'.&lt;ref&gt;Brian W. Shaffer, ''The Blinding Torch'' (1993) p. 151&lt;/ref&gt; Kernberg saw the difference between normal narcissism and ' ''[[pathological narcissism]]''...[as] withdrawal into "splendid isolation"'&lt;ref&gt;[[Salman Akhtar]], ''Comprehensive Dictionary of Psychoanalysis'' (2009) p. 190&lt;/ref&gt; in the latter instance; while [[Herbert Rosenfeld]] was concerned with 'states of withdrawal commonly seen in narcissistic patients in which death is idealised as superior to life', as well as with 'the alternation of states of narcissistic withdrawal and ego disintegration'.&lt;ref&gt;[[John Steiner]]/Herbert A. Rosenfeld, ''Rosenfeld in Retrospective'' (2008) p. 66 and p.95&lt;/ref&gt;

===Schizoid withdrawal===

Closely related to narcissistic withdrawal is '[[Schizoid personality disorder|schizoid withdrawal]]: the escape from too great pressure by abolishing emotional relationships altogether'.&lt;ref&gt;Josephine Klein, ''Our Need for Others'' (London 1994) p. 421&lt;/ref&gt; All such 'fantastic refuges from need are forms of emotional starvation, [[megalomania]]s and distortions of reality born of fear'.&lt;ref&gt;Adam Phillips, ''The Beast in the Nursery'' (London 1998) p. 3&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sociology==

'Narcissists will isolate themselves, leave their families, ignore others, do anything to preserve a special...sense of self'&lt;ref&gt;[[Joan Lachkar]], ''The Narcissisitic/Borderline Couple'' (1992) p. 82&lt;/ref&gt; Arguably, however, all such 'narcissistic withdrawal is haunted by its ''alter ego'': the ghost of a full social presence'&lt;ref&gt;James Booth, ''New Larkins for Old'' (2000) p. 42&lt;/ref&gt; - with people living their lives 'along a continuum which ranges from the maximal degree of social commitment...to a maximal degree of social withdrawal'.&lt;ref&gt;John O'Neill, ''Sociology as  Skin Trade'' (London 1972) p. 171-2&lt;/ref&gt;

If 'of all modes of narcissistic withdrawal, depression is the most crippling',&lt;ref&gt;Harold Barrett, ''Rhetoric and Civility'' (1991) p. 52&lt;/ref&gt; a contributing factor may be that 'depressed persons come to appreciate consciously how much social effort is in fact required in the normal course of keeping one's usual place in undertakings'.&lt;ref&gt;[[Erving Goffman]], ''Relations in Public'' (Penguin 1972) p. 448n&lt;/ref&gt;

==Therapy==

[[Object relations theory]] would see the process of therapy as one whereby the therapist enabled his or her patient to have 'resituated the object ''from'' the purely schizoid usage ''to'' the shared schizoid usage (initially) until eventually...the object relation - discussing, arguing, idealizing, hating, etc. - emerged'.&lt;ref&gt;Christopher Bollas, ''Cracking Up'' (London 1995) p. 86&lt;/ref&gt;

Fenichel considered that in patients where 'their narcissistic regression is a reaction to narcissistic injuries; if they are shown this fact
and given time to face the real injuries and to develop other types of reaction, they may be helped enormously'&lt;ref&gt;Fenichel, p. 451&lt;/ref&gt; [[Neville Symington]] however estimated that 'often a kind of war develops between analyst and patient, with the analyst trying to haul the patient out of the cocoon...his narcissistic envelope...and the patient pulling for all his worth in the other direction'.&lt;ref&gt;Neville Symington, ''Narcissism: A New Theory'' (London 2003) p. 77&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6961">The '''negative double''' is a form of [[takeout double]] in [[Contract bridge|bridge]]. It is made by the responder after his right-hand opponent [[overcall]]s on the first round of bidding, and is used to show both support for the unbid suits as well as some values. It is treated as forcing, but not unconditionally so. In practice, the negative double is sometimes used as a sort of catch-all, made when no other call properly describes responder's hand. Therefore, a partnership might even treat the negative double as a wide-ranging call that merely shows some values.

==Usage==

Using the modern negative double convention, it is understood that a double over an initial overcall is conventional, and ''not'' for penalties (but see [[#Playing for penalties|Playing for penalties]]). For example, using this convention, the following doubles would be regarded as negative, not for penalty:

*1{{Clubs}} – (1{{Diams}}) – Dbl
*1m – (1M) – Dbl
*1{{Hearts}} – (1{{Spades}}) – Dbl
*1M – (2m) – Dbl

In understandings regarding negative doubles, the emphasis is on major suit lengths. This is largely due to the special value that tournament play, especially the pairs game, places on major suits. Since the mid-1980s, the negative double has been used mainly to stand in for a bid in an unbid major suit.

Most partnerships using the negative double agree that it applies only through a particular level of overcall. For example, they may agree that the double of an overcall through 3{{Spades}} is negative, and that beyond 3{{Spades}} a double is for penalties.

At [[rubber bridge]] many players are reluctant to give up the penalty double of an overcall, and so do not use the double as conventional.

==History of terms used for this bid==

The term ''negative double'' was initially employed to distinguish it from the ''penalty'', or ''business'', or ''positive'' double, and signified a double over an opponent's opening bid whose meaning was a request for partner to bid his best suit. Around 1930, the term ''informatory double'' replaced ''negative double'', and that term later gave way to ''[[takeout double]]'' as it is used at present; the original term ''negative double'' fell into disuse.

In 1957, [[Alvin Roth (bridge)|Alvin Roth]] in his partnership with [[Tobias Stone]] appropriated the abandoned term ''negative double'' to denote a conventional double by responder over an overcall and gave it its current meaning.&lt;ref name=OEB7303&gt;{{OEB|7|303}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bid was also briefly known as ''Sputnik'', because it was as new as the [[Sputnik|satellite of that name]] that the Soviet Union had recently launched. The term is still used sometimes in Europe.&lt;ref name =OEB7303/&gt;

==Forcing==

The negative double is generally [[forcing bid|forcing]], but opener might pass to convert the double to a penalty double. There is a special agreement called [[negative free bid]]s, under which (after the overcall) the bid of a new suit by responder is not forcing. However, most negative doublers play that a new suit response (or [[Contract bridge glossary#F|free bid]]), whether at the one level or higher, is forcing.

The negative double loses even more definition when it can be made with a very broad range of strength, from roughly six HCP up to game forcing values. In a pinch, players use it to "get by this round of bidding."

==Playing for penalties==

The negative double does not cause the partnership to completely lose the ability to penalize an overcall. There are two ways that the overcall can be doubled for penalties. For example:

*1{{Diams}} – (1{{Hearts}}) – Dbl  – (Pass); '''Pass'''

Responder makes a negative double, and opener passes for penalties. This position is analogous to one in which a player makes a takeout double and his partner passes the double, converting it to a penalty double.

*1{{Diams}} – (1{{Hearts}}) – Pass – (Pass); Dbl – (Pass) – '''Pass'''

Responder passes the overcall, opener makes a re-opening double, and responder passes that double for penalties. This can be dangerous, because opener often doesn't know whether responder is simply too weak to make any call, or is hoping that opener can re-open with a double.

These situations are rare, though, and the more so because some five-card major partnerships play negative doubles ''over minor suit openings only.'' The rationale is that responder knows much more about opener's distribution after a major suit opening than after a minor suit opening, and can better judge whether to play in opener's major suit, to play for penalties by doubling, or to show a suit of his own.

==Support for unbid suits==

Partnerships have different understandings about the length in unbid suits that is shown by a negative double, and the understandings differ according both to which suits remain unbid and to the current level of the bidding. Nevertheless, the following are popular understandings:

*After 1{{Clubs}} – (1{{Diams}}),  a negative double is often understood to show at least four cards in both hearts and spades. The degree of support for this agreement has grown over the years. A poll of experts taken in 1983&lt;ref&gt;[[Bridge World Standard]] BWS84 poll results in [[The Bridge World]], July 1984, 17-22.&lt;/ref&gt; showed that about half concurred that doubler should have at least four hearts and at least four spades; a similar poll taken in 2000&lt;ref name="BWS2001 poll results"&gt;[http://www.bridgeworld.com/default.asp?d=bw_standard&amp;f=bwspolls.html BWS2001 poll results]&lt;/ref&gt; showed 80% in concurrence.
*After 1m – (1{{Hearts}}), a popular agreement is that a negative double shows exactly four spades. Responder would bid 1{{Spades}} with five or more. However, in 2000, this approach was favored by fewer than two thirds of polled experts.&lt;ref name="BWS2001 poll results"/&gt;
*After 1m – (1{{Spades}}), in contrast to the prior sequence, most experts prefer the negative double here to show at ''least'' four hearts – not ''exactly'' four hearts.
*After 1M – (2m), most play that a negative double shows at least four cards in the other major.
*After 1{{Diams}} – (2{{Clubs}}), few play that double shows at least four cards in ''each'' major, but most play that doubler shows at least one major at least four cards long.
*After 1{{Hearts}} - (1{{Spades}}) or 1{{Spades}} - (2{{Hearts}}), the negative double shows at least 4 cards in each minor because there are no unbid major suits.

[[File:Neural Correlates Of Consciousness.jpg|thumb|300px|right|The Neuronal Correlates of Consciousness (NCC) constitute the smallest set of neural events and structures sufficient for a given conscious percept or explicit memory. This case involves synchronized action potentials in [[neocortex|neocortical]] pyramidal neurons.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Koch2004|Koch 2004]], Figure 1.1 ''The Neuronal Correlates of Consciousness'' p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt; ]]
The '''neural correlates of consciousness''' ('''NCC''') constitute the minimal set of neuronal events and mechanisms sufficient for a specific conscious [[Perception#Process_and_terminology|percept]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Koch2004|Koch 2004]], p. 304.&lt;/ref&gt; Neuroscientists use empirical approaches to discover [[neural correlate]]s of subjective phenomena.&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.klab.caltech.edu/~koch/glossary.html here] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130313192029/http://www.klab.caltech.edu/~koch/glossary.html |date=2013-03-13 }} for a glossary of related terms.&lt;/ref&gt; The set should be ''minimal'' because, under the assumption that the brain is sufficient to give rise to any given conscious experience, the question is which of its components is necessary to produce it.

==Neurobiological approach to consciousness==
A science of [[consciousness]] must explain the exact relationship between subjective mental states and brain states, the nature of the relationship between the conscious mind and the electro-chemical interactions in the body ([[mind–body problem]]). Progress in [[neuropsychology]] and [[neurophilosophy]] has come from focusing on the body rather than the mind. In this context the neuronal correlates of consciousness may be viewed as its causes, and [[consciousness]] may be thought of as a state-dependent property of some undefined [[complex systems|complex]], adaptive, and highly interconnected biological system.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Squire2008|Squire 2008]], p. 1223.&lt;/ref&gt;

Discovering and characterizing neural correlates does not offer a theory of consciousness that can explain how particular systems experience anything at all, or how and why they are associated with consciousness, the so-called [[hard problem of consciousness]],&lt;ref name="Kandel2007p382"&gt;[[#Kandel2007|Kandel 2007]], p. 382.&lt;/ref&gt; but understanding the NCC may be a step toward such a theory. Most neurobiologists assume that the variables giving rise to consciousness are to be found at the neuronal level, governed by classical physics, though a few scholars have proposed theories of [[quantum consciousness]] based on [[quantum mechanics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Quantum physics in neuroscience and psychology: A neurophysiological model of mind/brain interaction |author1=Jeffrey M. Schwartz |author2=Henry P. Stapp |author3=Mario Beauregard |url=http://www-physics.lbl.gov/~stapp/PTB6.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is great apparent redundancy and parallelism in neural networks so, while activity in one group of neurons may correlate with a percept in one case, a different population might mediate a related percept if the former population is lost or inactivated. It may be that every phenomenal, subjective state has a neural correlate. Where the NCC can be induced artificially the subject will experience the associated percept, while perturbing or inactivating the region of correlation for a specific percept will affect the percept or cause it to disappear, giving a cause-effect relationship from the neural region to the nature of the percept.

What characterizes the NCC? What are the commonalities between the NCC for seeing and for hearing? Will the NCC involve all the [[Pyramidal cell|pyramidal neurons]] in the cortex at any given point in time? Or only a subset of long-range projection cells in the frontal lobes that project to the sensory cortices in the back? Neurons that fire in a rhythmic manner? Neurons that fire in a [[neural oscillations|synchronous manner]]? These are some of the proposals that have been advanced over the years.&lt;ref&gt;See [[#Chalmers1998|Chalmers 1998]], available online.&lt;/ref&gt;

The growing ability of neuroscientists to manipulate neurons using methods from molecular biology in combination with optical tools (e.g., [[#Adamantidis2007|Adamantidis et al. 2007]]) depends on the simultaneous development of appropriate behavioral assays and model organisms amenable to large-scale genomic analysis and manipulation. It is the combination of such fine-grained neuronal analysis in animals with ever more sensitive psychophysical and brain imaging techniques in humans, complemented by the development of a robust theoretical predictive framework, that will hopefully lead to a rational understanding of consciousness, one of the central mysteries of life.

==Level of arousal and content of consciousness==
There are two common but distinct dimensions of the term ''consciousness'',&lt;ref&gt;[[#Zeman2001|Zeman 2001]]&lt;/ref&gt; one involving ''arousal'' and ''states of consciousness'' and the other involving ''content of consciousness'' and ''conscious states''. To be conscious ''of'' anything the brain must be in a relatively high state of arousal (sometimes called ''vigilance''), whether in wakefulness or [[REM sleep]], vividly experienced in dreams although usually not remembered. Brain arousal level fluctuates in a [[circadian]] rhythm but may be influenced by lack of sleep, drugs and alcohol, physical exertion, etc. Arousal can be measured behaviorally by the signal amplitude that triggers some criterion reaction (for instance, the sound level necessary to evoke an eye movement or a head turn toward the sound source). Clinicians use scoring systems such as the [[Glasgow Coma Scale]] to assess the level of arousal in patients.

High arousal states are associated with conscious states that have specific content, seeing, hearing, remembering, planning or fantasizing about something. Different levels or states of consciousness are associated with different kinds of conscious experiences. The "awake" state is quite different from the "dreaming" state (for instance, the latter has little or no self-reflection) and from the state of deep sleep. In all three cases the basic physiology of the brain is affected, as it also is in ''altered states of consciousness'', for instance after taking drugs or during meditation when conscious perception and insight may be enhanced compared to the normal waking state.

Clinicians talk about ''impaired states of consciousness'' as in "the [[coma|comatose state]]", "the [[persistent vegetative state]]" (PVS), and "the [[minimally conscious state]]" (MCS). Here, "state" refers to different "amounts" of external/physical consciousness, from a total absence in coma, persistent vegetative state and general anesthesia, to a fluctuating and limited form of conscious sensation in a minimally conscious state such as sleep walking or during a complex partial [[epileptic]] seizure.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Schiff2004|Schiff 2004]]&lt;/ref&gt; The repertoire of conscious states or experiences accessible to a patient in a minimally conscious state is comparatively limited. In brain death there is no arousal, but it is unknown whether the subjectivity of experience has been interrupted, rather than its observable link with the organism.

The potential ''richness of conscious experience'' appears to increase from deep sleep to drowsiness to full wakefulness, as might be quantified using notions from complexity theory that incorporate both the dimensionality as well as the granularity of conscious experience to give an [[Integrated information theory|integrated-information-theoretical account]] of consciousness.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Tononi2016|Tononi et al. 2016]]&lt;/ref&gt; As behavioral arousal increases so does the range and complexity of possible behavior. Yet in REM sleep there is a characteristic [[atonia]], low motor arousal and the person is difficult to wake up, but there is still high metabolic and electric brain activity and vivid perception.

Many nuclei with distinct chemical signatures in the [[thalamus]], [[midbrain]] and [[pons]] must function for a subject to be in a sufficient state of brain arousal to experience anything at all. These nuclei therefore belong to the enabling factors for consciousness. Conversely it is likely that the specific content of any particular conscious sensation is mediated by particular neurons in cortex and their associated satellite structures, including the [[amygdala]], [[thalamus]], [[claustrum]] and the [[basal ganglia]].

==The neuronal basis of perception==
The possibility of precisely manipulating visual percepts in time and space has made [[visual perception|vision]] a preferred modality in the quest for the NCC. Psychologists have perfected a number of techniques – [[Visual masking|masking]], [[binocular rivalry]], [[flash suppression|continuous flash suppression]], [[motion induced blindness]], [[change blindness]], [[inattentional blindness]] – in which the seemingly simple and unambiguous relationship between a physical stimulus in the world and its associated percept in the privacy of the subject's mind is disrupted.&lt;ref&gt;[[#KimBlake2004|Kim and Blake 2004]]&lt;/ref&gt; In particular a stimulus can be perceptually suppressed for seconds or even minutes at a time: the image is projected into one of the observer's eyes but is invisible, not seen. In this manner the neural mechanisms that respond to the subjective percept rather than the physical stimulus can be isolated, permitting visual consciousness to be tracked in the brain. In a ''perceptual [[illusion]]'', the physical stimulus remains fixed while the percept fluctuates. The best known example is the ''[[Necker cube]]'' whose 12 lines can be perceived in one of two different ways in depth.

[[File:NeuralCorrelatesOfConsciousness3.jpg|thumb|300px|left|The Necker Cube: The left line drawing can be perceived in one of two distinct depth configurations shown on the right. Without any other cue, the visual system flips back and forth between these two interpretations.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Koch2004|Koch 2004]], Figure 16.1 ''The Bistable Necker Cube'', p. 270.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
A perceptual illusion that can be precisely controlled is ''[[binocular rivalry]]''. Here, a small image, e.g., a horizontal grating, is presented to the left eye, and another image, e.g., a vertical grating, is shown to the corresponding location in the right eye. In spite of the constant visual stimulus, observers consciously see the horizontal grating alternate every few seconds with the vertical one. The brain does not allow for the simultaneous perception of both images.

Logothetis and colleagues&lt;ref&gt;[[#Logothetis1998|Logothetis 1998]]&lt;/ref&gt; recorded a variety of visual cortical areas in awake macaque monkeys performing a binocular rivalry task. Macaque monkeys can be trained to report whether they see the left or the right image. The distribution of the switching times and the way in which changing the contrast in one eye affects these leaves little doubt that monkeys and humans experience the same basic phenomenon. In the primary visual cortex (V1) only a small fraction of cells weakly modulated their response as a function of the percept of the monkey while most cells responded to one or the other retinal stimulus with little regard to what the animal perceived at the time. But in a high-level cortical area such as the inferior temporal cortex along the [[ventral stream]] almost all neurons responded only to the perceptually dominant stimulus, so that a "face" cell only fired when the animal indicated that it saw the face and not the pattern presented to the other eye. This implies that NCC involve neurons active in the inferior temporal cortex: it is likely that specific reciprocal actions of neurons in the inferior temporal and parts of the prefrontal cortex are necessary.

A number of [[fMRI]] experiments that have exploited binocular rivalry and related illusions to identify the hemodynamic activity underlying visual consciousness in humans demonstrate quite conclusively that activity in the upper stages of the ventral pathway (e.g., the [[fusiform face area]] and the [[parahippocampal place area]]) as well as in early regions, including V1 and the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN), follow the percept and not the retinal stimulus.&lt;ref&gt;[[#ReesFrith2007|Rees and Frith 2007]]&lt;/ref&gt; Further, a number of fMRI&lt;ref&gt;[[#HaynesRees2005|Haynes and Rees 2005]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lee2007|Lee et al. 2007]]&lt;/ref&gt; and DTI experiments&lt;ref&gt;[[#ShimonoNiki2013|Shimono and Niki 2013]]&lt;/ref&gt;  suggest V1 is necessary but not sufficient for visual consciousness.&lt;ref name="Crick"&gt;[[#CrickKoch1995|Crick and Koch 1995]]&lt;/ref&gt;

In a related perceptual phenomenon, ''[[flash suppression]]'', the percept associated with an image projected into one eye is suppressed by flashing another image into the other eye while the original image remains. Its methodological advantage over binocular rivalry is that the timing of the perceptual transition is determined by an external trigger rather than by an internal event. The majority of cells in the inferior temporal cortex and the superior temporal sulcus of monkeys trained to report their percept during flash suppression follow the animal's percept: when the cell's preferred stimulus is perceived, the cell responds. If the picture is still present on the retina but is perceptually suppressed, the cell falls silent, even though primary visual cortex neurons fire.&lt;ref&gt;[[#LeopoldLogothetis1996|Leopold and Logothetis 1996]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#SheinbergLogothetis1997|Sheinberg and Logothetis 1997]]&lt;/ref&gt; Single-neuron recordings in the medial temporal lobe of epilepsy patients during flash suppression likewise demonstrate abolishment of response when the preferred stimulus is present but perceptually masked.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Kreiman2002|Kreiman et al. 2002]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Global disorders of consciousness==
Given the absence of any accepted criterion of the minimal neuronal correlates necessary for consciousness, the distinction between a persistently vegetative patient who shows regular sleep-wave transitions and may be able to move or smile, and a minimally conscious patient who can communicate (on occasion) in a meaningful manner (for instance, by differential eye movements) and who shows some signs of consciousness, is often difficult. In global anesthesia the patient should not experience psychological trauma but the level of arousal should be compatible with clinical exigencies.

[[File:NeuralCorrelatesOfConsciousness2.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Midline structures in the brainstem and thalamus necessary to regulate the level of brain arousal. Small, bilateral lesions in many of these nuclei cause a global loss of consciousness.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Koch2004|Koch 2004]], Figure 5.1 ''The Cholinergic Enabling System'' p. 92. See Chapter 5, available on line.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Blood-oxygen-level-dependent [[fMRI]] have demonstrated normal patterns of brain activity in a patient in a vegetative state following a severe traumatic brain injury when asked to imagine playing tennis or visiting rooms in his/her house.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Owen2006|Owen et al. 2006]]&lt;/ref&gt; Differential brain imaging of patients with such global disturbances of consciousness (including [[akinetic mutism]]) reveal that dysfunction in a widespread cortical network including medial and lateral prefrontal and parietal associative areas is associated with a global loss of awareness.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Laureys2005|Laureys 2005]]&lt;/ref&gt; Impaired consciousness in [[epileptic]] seizures of the [[medial temporal lobe|temporal lobe]] was likewise accompanied by a decrease in cerebral blood flow in frontal and parietal association cortex and an increase in midline structures such as the [[thalamus|mediodorsal thalamus]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Blumenfeld2004|Blumenfeld et al. 2004]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Relatively local bilateral injuries to midline (paramedian) subcortical structures can also cause a complete loss of awareness.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Koch2004|Koch 2004]],  p. 92&lt;/ref&gt; These structures therefore ''enable'' and control brain arousal (as determined by metabolic or electrical activity) and are necessary neural correlates. One such example is the heterogeneous collection of more than two dozen nuclei on each side of the upper brainstem (pons, midbrain and in the posterior hypothalamus), collectively referred to as the [[reticular activating system]] (RAS). Their axons project widely throughout the brain. These nuclei – three-dimensional collections of neurons with their own cyto-architecture and neurochemical identity – release distinct neuromodulators such as acetylcholine, noradrenaline/norepinephrine, serotonin, histamine and orexin/hypocretin to control the excitability of the thalamus and forebrain, mediating alternation between wakefulness and sleep as well as general level of behavioral and brain arousal. After such trauma, however, eventually the excitability of the thalamus and forebrain can recover and consciousness can return.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Villablanca2004|Villablanca 2004]]&lt;/ref&gt; Another enabling factor for consciousness are the five or more [[intralaminar nuclei]] (ILN) of the thalamus. These receive input from many brainstem nuclei and project strongly, directly to the basal ganglia and, in a more distributed manner, into layer I of much of the neocortex. Comparatively small (1&amp;nbsp;cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; or less) bilateral lesions in the thalamic ILN completely knock out all awareness.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Bogen1995|Bogen 1995]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Forward versus feedback projections==
Many actions in response to sensory inputs are rapid, transient, stereotyped, and unconscious.&lt;ref name="milner"&gt;[[#MilnerGoodale1995|Milner and Goodale 1995]]&lt;/ref&gt; They could be thought of as cortical reflexes and are characterized by rapid and somewhat stereotyped responses that can take the form of rather complex automated behavior as seen, e.g., in complex partial [[epileptic]] seizures. These automated responses, sometimes called ''zombie behaviors'',&lt;ref&gt;[[#KochCrick2001|Koch and Crick 2001]]&lt;/ref&gt; could be contrasted by a slower, all-purpose conscious mode that deals more slowly with broader, less stereotyped aspects of the sensory inputs (or a reflection of these, as in imagery) and takes time to decide on appropriate thoughts and responses. Without such a consciousness mode, a vast number of different zombie modes would be required to react to unusual events.

A feature that distinguishes humans from most animals is that we are not born with an extensive repertoire of behavioral programs that would enable us to survive on our own ("[[physiological prematurity]]"). To compensate for this, we have an unmatched ability to learn, i.e., to consciously acquire such programs by imitation or exploration. Once consciously acquired and sufficiently exercised, these programs can become automated to the extent that their execution happens beyond the realms of our awareness. Take, as an example, the incredible fine motor skills exerted in playing a Beethoven piano sonata or the sensorimotor coordination required to ride a motorcycle along a curvy mountain road. Such complex behaviors are possible only because a sufficient number of the subprograms involved can be executed with minimal or even suspended conscious control. In fact, the conscious system may actually interfere somewhat with these automated programs.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Beilock2002|Beilock et al. 2002]]&lt;/ref&gt;

From an evolutionary standpoint it clearly makes sense to have both automated behavioral programs that can be executed rapidly in a stereotyped and automated manner, and a slightly slower system that allows time for thinking and planning more complex behavior. This latter aspect may be one of the principal functions of consciousness. Other philosophers, however, have suggested that consciousness would not be necessary for any functional advantage in evolutionary processes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| authors=[[Owen Flanagan]] and T.

MALEY |author3=Gualtiero PICCININI | year = 2015 | title = Is Consciousness a Spandrel?. | url = | journal = Journal of the American Philosophical Association | volume = 1 | issue = | pages = 365–383 | doi = 10.1017/apa.2014.10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Several scholars including Pinker, Chomsky, Edelman, and Luria have indicated the importance of the emergence of human language as an important regulative mechanism of learning and memory in the context of the development of higher-order consciousness.

It seems possible that visual zombie modes in the cortex mainly use the [[Two Streams hypothesis#Dorsal stream|dorsal stream]] in the parietal region.&lt;ref name="milner"/&gt; However, parietal activity can affect consciousness by producing attentional effects on the ventral stream, at least under some circumstances. The conscious mode for vision depends largely on the early visual areas (beyond V1) and especially on the ventral stream.

Seemingly complex visual processing (such as detecting animals in natural, cluttered scenes) can be accomplished by the human cortex within 130–150 ms,&lt;ref&gt;[[#Thorpe1996|Thorpe et al. 1996]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#VanRullenKoch2003|VanRullen and Koch 2003]]&lt;/ref&gt; far too brief for eye movements and conscious perception to occur. Furthermore, reflexes such as the [[oculovestibular reflex]] take place at even more rapid time-scales. It is quite plausible that such behaviors are mediated by a purely feed-forward moving wave of spiking activity that passes from the retina through V1, into V4, IT and prefrontal cortex, until it affects motorneurons in the spinal cord that control the finger press (as in a typical laboratory experiment). The hypothesis that the basic processing of information is feedforward is supported most directly by the short times (approx. 100 ms) required for a selective response to appear in IT cells.

Conversely, conscious perception is believed to require more sustained, reverberatory neural activity, most likely via global feedback from frontal regions of neocortex back to sensory cortical areas&lt;ref name= "Crick"/&gt; that builds up over time until it exceeds a critical threshold. At this point, the sustained neural activity rapidly propagates to parietal, prefrontal and anterior cingulate cortical regions, thalamus, claustrum and related structures that support short-term memory, multi-modality integration, planning, speech, and other processes intimately related to consciousness. Competition prevents more than one or a very small number of percepts to be simultaneously and actively represented. This is the core hypothesis of the [[global workspace theory]] of consciousness.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Baars1988|Baars 1988]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Dehaene2003|Dehaene et al. 2003]]&lt;/ref&gt;

In brief, while rapid but transient neural activity in the thalamo-cortical system can mediate complex behavior without conscious sensation, it is surmised that consciousness requires sustained but well-organized neural activity dependent on long-range cortico-cortical feedback.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="28630">A '''planet symbol''' (or ''planetary symbol'') is a graphical symbol used in [[astrological symbol|astrology]] and [[astronomical symbol|astronomy]] to represent a [[classical planet]] (including the Sun and the Moon) or one of the eight modern planets. The symbols are also used in [[alchemy]] to represent the metals that are [[Classical planets in Western alchemy|associated]] with the planets. The use of these symbols is based in ancient [[Greco-Roman astronomy]], although their current shapes are a development of the 16th century.

The classical planets with their symbols and associated metals are: 
&lt;center&gt;
{| class=wikitable
|-
|planet || Moon || Mercury || Venus  || Sun || Mars || Jupiter || Saturn 
|-
|symbol || {{resize|150%|☾}}  || {{resize|150%|☿}} || {{resize|150%|♀}} || {{resize|150%|☉}} || {{resize|150%|♂}} || {{resize|150%|♃}} || {{resize|150%|♄}} 
|-
|metal || silver || mercury || copper || gold || iron || tin || lead
|-
|}
&lt;/center&gt;

The [[International Astronomical Union]] discourages the use of these symbols in modern journal articles, and their style manual proposes one- and two-letter abbreviations for the names of the planets for cases where planetary symbols might be used, such as in the headings of tables.&lt;ref name=iau-style-manual &gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The modern planets with their symbols and abbreviations recommended by the IAU: 
&lt;center&gt;
{| class=wikitable
|-
|planet || Mercury || Venus || Earth || Mars || Jupiter ||Saturn || Uranus || Neptune

|symbol || {{resize|150%|☿}} || {{resize|150%|♀}} || {{resize|150%|♁}} || {{resize|150%|♂}} || {{resize|150%|♃}} || {{resize|150%|♄}} || {{resize|150%|⛢}} || {{resize|150%|♆}} 
|-
|IAU || Me || V || E || Ma || J || S || U || N
|-
|}
&lt;/center&gt;

The symbols of Venus and Mars are also used to represent [[female]] and [[male]] in biology and botany, following a convention introduced by [[Linnaeus]] in the 1750s.

==History==
===Classical planets===
The written symbols for Mercury, Venus, Jupiter, and Saturn have been traced to forms found in late Greek papyri.&lt;ref name=jones-1999&gt;{{cite book

| last = Jones
| first = Alexander
| date = 1999

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Antecedents of the planetary symbols are attested in the attributes given to classical deities, represented in simplified pictographic form in the Roman era. ''Bianchini's [[planisphere]]'' (2nd century, [[Louvre]] inv. Ma 540)&lt;ref name=imss&gt;{{cite web
| url = http://brunelleschi.imss.fi.it/galileopalazzostrozzi/object/BianchinisPlanisphere.html

}}&lt;/ref&gt; shows the seven planets represented by portraits of the seven corresponding gods, each with a simple representation of an attribute, as follows: Mercury has a [[caduceus]]; Venus has a cord attached to her necklace which is connected to another necklace; Mars has a spear; Jupiter has a staff; Saturn has a scythe; the Sun has a circlet with rays emanating from it; and the Moon has a headdress with a crescent attached.&lt;ref name=maunder&gt;Maunder (1934)&lt;/ref&gt;

A diagram in the astronomical compendium by Johannes Kamateros (12th century) shows the Sun represented by the circle with a ray, Jupiter by the letter ''zeta'' (the initial of [[Zeus]], Jupiter's counterpart in Greek mythology), Mars by a shield crossed by a spear, and the remaining classical planets by symbols resembling the modern ones, without the cross-mark seen in modern versions of the symbols. These cross-marks first appear in the late 15th or early 16th century. According to Maunder, the addition of crosses appears to be "an attempt to give a savour of Christianity to the symbols of the old pagan gods."&lt;ref name=maunder /&gt;

The modern symbols for the seven classical planets are found in a woodcut of the seven planets in a Latin translation of [[Abu Ma'shar]]'s ''De Magnis Coniunctionibus'' printed at Venice in 1506, represented as the corresponding gods riding chariots.&lt;ref name=maunder239&gt;Maunder (1934:239)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Earth]] is not one of the  classical planets (the word "planet" by definition describing "wandering stars" as seen from Earth's surface). 
Its status as planet is a consequence of the development of [[heliocentrism]].
Nevertheless, there are ancient symbols for Earth, notably a [[cross]] representing the four [[cardinal direction]]s, as a cross in a circle also interpreted as a  globe with [[equator]] and a [[meridian (geography)|meridian]];&lt;ref name=penny-cyclopaedia&gt;{{cite book

Alternatively, there is the [[globus cruciger]] [[File:Earth symbol alternate.svg|16x25px|Earth]] (U+2641 {{resize|150%|♁}}),  now most commonly used as planetary symbol.
The "globus cruciger" symbol is also used as an alchemical symbol of [[antimony]].

Another symbol, [[File:Uranus's astrological symbol.svg|15px|Uranus]], was suggested by Lalande in 1784.

[[Pluto]] was also considered a planet from its discovery in 1930 until its re-classification as a "[[dwarf planet]]" in 2006. The symbol used for Pluto was a ligature of the letters P and L (Unicode U+2647 {{resize|150%|♇}}).

In the 19th century, symbols for the major [[asteroid]]s were also in use, including 
[[4 Vesta|Vesta]] (an altar with fire on it; {{resize|150%|⚶}}	U+26B6), [[3 Juno|Juno]] (a sceptre; {{resize|150%|⚵}} U+26B5), [[Ceres (dwarf planet)|Ceres]] (a reaper's scythe; {{resize|150%|⚳}} U+26B3),&lt;ref name=penny-cyclopaedia /&gt; [[2 Pallas|Pallas]] ({{resize|150%|⚴}} U+26B4);

[[File:Moon symbol decrescent.svg|thumb|150px]]
{{commonscat|Luna symbols}}
{{commonscat|Crescent moon symbols}}
The [[crescent]] shape has been used to represent the Moon since earliest times. In classical anqituity, it is worn by lunar deities ([[Selene|Selene/Luna]], [[Artemis|Artemis/Diana]], [[Men (deity)|Men]], etc.) either on the head or behind the shoulders, with its horns pointing upward. 
Its representation with the horns pointing sideways (as a heraldic ''crescent increscent'' or ''crescent decrescent'') is early modern.

The same symbol can be used in a different context not for the Moon itself but for a [[lunar phase]], as part of a sequence of four symbols
for "new moon" (U+1F311 &amp;#x1F311;), "waxing" (U+263D &amp;#x263D;), "full moon" (U+1F315 &amp;#x1F315;) and "waning" (U+263E &amp;#x263E;).

===Venus===
[[File:Venus symbol.svg|thumb|150px]]
{{commons category|Venus symbols}}
The '''Venus symbol''' (♀) consists of a circle with a small [[Cross (symbol)|cross]] below it. 
It originates in [[Late Antiquity]] as an [[astrological symbol]] for the [[classical planet|planet]] [[Venus]] (associated with the [[Venus (mythology)|goddess Venus]]), and hence as [[alchemy|alchemical]] symbol for [[copper]]. In modern times, it is still used as the [[astronomical symbol]] for Venus, although its use is discouraged
by the [[International Astronomical Union]].&lt;ref name=iau-style-manual &gt;{{cite book

In  [[zoology]] and [[botany]], it is used to represent the female sex (alongside the astrological symbol for [[Mars]] representing the male sex), following a convention introduced by [[Linnaeus]] in the 1750s.&lt;ref name="Stearn"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Stearn|first=William T.|title=The Origin of the Male and Female Symbols of Biology|journal=Taxon|date=May 1962|volume=11|issue=4|pages=109–113|jstor=1217734|doi=10.2307/1217734}} "In his Systema Naturae (Leyden, 1735) he [Linnaeus] used them with their traditional associations for metals. Their first biological use is in the Linnaean dissertation ''Plantae hybridae xxx sistit J. J. Haartman'' (1751) where in discussing hybrid plants Linnaeus denoted the supposed female parent species by the sign ♀, the male parent by the sign ♂, the hybrid by ☿ 'matrem signo ♀, patrem ♂ &amp; plantam hybridam ☿ designavero'. In subsequent publications he retained the signs ♀ and ♂ for male and female individuals but discarded ☿ for hybrids; the last are now indicated by the multiplication sign ×. Linnaeus's first general use of the signs of ♀ and ♂ was in his ''Species Plantarum'' (1753) written between 1746 and 1752 and surveying concisely the whole plant kingdom as then known." (p. 110)&lt;/ref&gt;
Following the biological convention, the symbol in the 20th century{{year needed|date=September 2016}} also came to be used in sociological contexts to represent [[women]] or [[femininity]].

The symbol appears without the cross-mark (⚲) in Johannes Kamateros (12th century). In the  ''Bianchini's planisphere'' (2nd century), Venus is represented by a necklace.&lt;ref name=imss/&gt; 
The idea that the symbol represents the goddess' [[hand mirror]] dates to the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;see 
Hiram Mattison, ''A high-school astronomy'' (1857), [https://books.google.com/books?id=HocEAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA32 p. 32].&lt;/ref&gt;

The modern astronomical symbol for the Sun ([[circled dot]], Unicode U+2609 ☉) was first used in the Renaissance.

===Mars===
[[Image:Mars symbol.svg|150px|thumb]]
{{commons category|Mars symbols}}
The '''Mars symbol''' (♂) is a depiction of a circle with an arrow emerging from it, pointing at an angle to the upper right. As astrological symbol it represents the planet [[Mars]] (connected to the [[Mars (deity)|god Mars (Ares)]]) and hence iron in alchemy. In  zoology and botany, it is used to represent the male sex (alongside the astrological symbol for Venus representing the female sex), following a convention introduced by [[Linnaeus]] in the 1750s.&lt;ref name="Stearn"/&gt;

The symbol in its current form represents spear and shield and dates to the early 16th century. It is derived from a medieval form where the spear was drawn across the shield, which in turn was based on a convention used in antiquity (''Bianchini's planisphere'') which represented Mars by a spear.&lt;ref name=imss&gt;{{cite web

===Jupiter===
[[File:Jupiter symbol.svg|thumb|150px]]
{{commons category|Jupiter symbols}}
The origin of the symbol for  [[Jupiter]]  [[File:Jupiter symbol.svg|x25px|Jupiter]] (U+2643 {{resize|150%|♃}}) is not entirely clear.
[[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]]'s attribute is a sceptre  (as [[king of the gods]]), but Kamateros (12th century) represents Jupiter simply by the letter ''[[zeta]]'' ζ (for ''[[Zeus]]''). The modern symbol as used from the 16th century is apparently based on a majuscule zeta Ζ with the addition of a vertical stroke to form the Christian cross.&lt;ref name=maunder244&gt;Maunder (1934), p. 244.&lt;/ref&gt; The less-than-intuitive symbol gave rise to various ad hoc interpretations by modern commentators; thus, the editors of the ''Penny cyclopedia'' (1842) thought might "supposed to be a symbol of the thunder (arm and hand holding thunder?)"&lt;ref name=penny-cyclopaedia/&gt; and more recently the sign has been reported as based on the "Egyptian hieroglyph for the eagle".&lt;ref&gt;Pat Ward, Barbara Ward, ''Space Frontiers, Grades 4 - 8: EXPLORING Astronomy'',  Carson-Dellosa Publishing, 22 Oct 2012 [https://books.google.com/books?id=I0zbfXcwTQ8C&amp;pg=PA42 p. 42] (without further reference).&lt;!--yeah, they took this from Wikipedia, where it was based on a 2008 web page from NASA https://web.archive.org/web/20100317223147/http://solarsystem.nasa.gov/multimedia/display.cfm?IM_ID=167
there doesn't seem to be a real reference for this, but it's made it into print now anyway. There is no Egyptian "eagle" hieroglyph, unless you count G1 (Egyptian vulture) which looks like -- an actual vulture/eagle. --&gt;

===Saturn===
[[File:Saturn symbol.svg|thumb|150px]]

[[Saturn (mythology)|Saturn]] is usually depicted with a [[scythe]] or [[sickle]], and the planetary symbol has apparently evolved from a picture of this attribute, in Kamateros (12th century) shown in a shape similar to the letter ''[[eta]]'' η, with the horizontal stroke added along with the "Christianization" of the other symbols in the early 16th century, [[File:Saturn symbol.svg|x25px|Saturn]] (U+2644 {{resize|150%|♄}}).

In [[criminology]], the '''power-control theory of gender and delinquency''' (abbreviated as the '''power-control theory''') holds the gender distribution of [[:wikt:delinquency|delinquency]] is caused by stratification from [[gender role|gender relations]] within the [[family]].&lt;ref name="MessnerKrohn1989"&gt;{{Cite book|author1=Steven F.

Power-control theory differs from other control theories that view crime as a cause of low [[social status]] (cited from book). This theory compares gender and parental control mechanisms in two different types of families; patriarchal and egalitarian to explain the differences in self-reported male and female misconduct. In patriarchal families, traditional gender roles were in practice, where the father would work outside the home, and the mother would be responsible for the child rearing. In egalitarian families, the household roles were shared equally between mothers and fathers.&lt;ref&gt;O'Grady 2007, p. 110.&lt;/ref&gt;

The theory was originally posited by [[John Hagan (sociologist)|John Hagan]] and further developed by [[A. R. Gillis]] and [[John Simpson (sociologist)|John Simpson]] at the [[University of Toronto]].&lt;ref name="clarify and extend"&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Hagan|first1=John |first2=A. R. |last2=Gillis |first3=John |last3=Simpson|date=January 1990|title=Clarifiying and Extending Power-Control Theory|journal=The American Journal of Sociology|publisher=University of Toronto|volume= 95|issue= 4|pages=1024–1037|jstor=2780649|doi=10.1086/229384}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development==

The power control theory was developed through a series of self-report surveys that was administered to high school students and their parents in suburban Toronto. Hagan and his colleagues contended that gender and the social class of the students' parents affected how much freedom these students had. For example, coming of age as they argued, was a more limiting experience than growing up as a male. Thereby, they found that the amount of power a parent had in the workplace was related to the control displayed in the household over their teenaged children. Moreover, parents who had the types of jobs where they must supervise the activities of subordinates also tended to be relatively tolerant of the trouble-making behaviour of their children, especially of their sons. This meant that teenaged boys are freer to deviate than teenaged girls. This study also found, focusing on relatively minor forms of deviance such as shoplifting and breaking street lights, that middle-class youth actually were freer to deviate than working-class youth.&lt;ref name="O'Grady 2007, p. 111"&gt;O'Grady 2007, p. 111.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Limitations==

According to Julian Tanner, he offers two interesting critical comments. Though the power control theory effectively explains common delinquency among ordinary youth, it does not explain violent and repetitive crime and, therefore, the power control theory cannot predict such behavior. In addition, the power control theory suggests that parents in egalitarian households are more likely to raise females as delinquent than a female growing up in a patriarchal family; however, UCR (uniform crime report) data shows that the opposite association exists and that the involvement in female labor force is actually related to lower levels of female delinquency. Also, after years of refining the power control theory, theorists have found the notion that mothers being more controlling over their daughters are more likely to be found in egalitarian families than patriarchal families, which is the opposite relationship the power control theory would likely predict.

When the theory was refined over the years, Singer and Levine (1988) found mixed support for the theory in their early attempts to test this theory. While mothers were seen to be more controlling over their daughters than their sons, the authors also found this to be more so with egalitarian than patriarchal families, which is a finding opposite to what power control theory would predict.&lt;ref name="O'Grady 2007, p. 111"/&gt;

==Theory extended beyond family==

The theory has been extended into adult social roles as well. Stratified behaviors typically associated with males, particularly those in authoritative positions, are now being seen more frequently in females attaining powerful roles. And like their male counterparts, their power is used to control those persons in subordinate roles, as indicated by the rise in reports of sexual harassment (cougar syndrome) and cronyism.

Despite the explanation of social roles, there has not been a feminist theory that is fully developed to explain for the uniqueness of female criminality. While males are reported to be more involved in every type of crime, females tend to be arrested for considerably minor property crimes. This is due to the idea that the character and level of female crime is not consistent with the traditional sociological explanations of crime.&lt;ref&gt;O'Grady 2007, p. 112.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Precision bias''' is a form of [[cognitive bias]] in which an evaluator of information commits a logical [[fallacy]] as the result of confusing [[accuracy and precision]]. More particularly, in assessing the merits of an argument, a measurement, or a report, an observer or assessor falls prey to precision bias when he or she believes that greater precision implies greater accuracy (i.e., that simply because a statement is precise, it is also true); the observer or assessor are said to provide [[false precision]].

Precision bias, whether called by that phrase or another, is addressed in fields such as economics, in which there is a significant danger that a seemingly impressive quantity of statistics may be collected even though these statistics may be of little value for demonstrating any particular truth.

It is also called the numeracy bias, or the range estimate aversion.

The [[clustering illusion]] and the [[Texas sharpshooter fallacy]] may both be treated as relatives of precision bias. In these former fallacies, precision is mistakenly considered evidence of causation, when in fact the clustered information may actually be the result of [[randomness]].

{{Reading}}

'''Reading education''' is the process by which individuals are taught to derive meaning from text. Schoolchildren not capable of reading competently by the end of third grade can face obstacles to success in education. The third grade marks a crucial point in reading because students start to encounter broader variety of texts in their fourth grade&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.centerforpubliceducation.org/research/learning-read-reading-learn-glance|title=http://www.centerforpubliceducation.org/research/learning-read-reading-learn-glance|website=www.centerforpubliceducation.org|access-date=2018-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;. 

Government-funded research on reading and reading instruction in the [[United States]] began in the 1960s. In the 1970s and 1980s, researchers began publishing findings based on converging evidence from multiple studies. However, these findings have been slow to move into typical classroom practice&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://scholar.harvard.edu/jameskim/publications/research-and-reading-wars-0|title=Research and the reading wars|access-date=2018-06-15|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

== Competencies for proficient reading ==

Proficient reading is equally dependent on two critical skills: the ability to understand the [[language]] in which the text is written, and the ability to recognize and process printed text. Each of these competencies is likewise dependent on lower level skills and cognitive abilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sedl.org/reading/framework/overview.html |author1=Hoover, Wesley A. |author2=Gough, Philip B. |title=Overview - The Cognitive Foundations of Learning to Read: A Framework |work=The Cognitive Foundations of Learning to Read: A Framework |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Children who readily understand spoken language and who are able to fluently and easily recognize printed words do not usually have difficulty with [[reading comprehension]]. However, students must be proficient in both competencies to read well; difficulty in either domain undermines the overall reading process. At the conclusion of reading, children should be able to retell the story in their own words including characters, setting, and the events of the story.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sedl.org/reading/framework/framework.pdf |author=Wren, Sebastian  |title=The Cognitive Foundations of Learning to Read: A Framework |format=pdf |work= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reading researchers define a skilled reader as one who can understand written text as well as they can understand the same passage if spoken.

There is some debate as to whether print recognition requires the ability to perceive printed text and [[translate]] it into spoken language, or rather to [[translate]] printed text directly into meaningful symbolic models and relationships. The existence of speed reading, and its typically high comprehension rate would suggest that the translation into verbal form as an intermediate to understanding is not a prerequisite for effective reading comprehension. This aspect of reading is the crux of much of the reading debate.

The purpose of reading is to have access to the literature of a specific language. Reading materials have traditionally been chosen from literary texts that represent 'higher' forms of culture. According to many traditional approaches, the learner's aim is to study vocabulary items, grammar and sentence structures, with a concern for learning the syntax of these 'higher' cultures. These approaches assume that authentic reading material is limited to the work or experience of great authors.

== Instructional methods ==

A variety of different methods of teaching reading have been advocated in [[English-speaking countries]].
In the United States, the debate is often more political than objective.&lt;ref name="Adams, MJ 13"&gt;{{cite book |author=Adams, Marilyn Jager |title=Beginning to read: thinking and learning about print |publisher=MIT Press |location=Cambridge, Massachusetts |year=1995 |pages=13 |isbn=0-262-51076-6 |oclc=469305891 |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Parties often divide into two camps which refuse to accept each other's terminology or frame of reference. Despite this both camps often incorporate aspects of the other's methods. Both camps accuse the other of causing failure to learn to read and write.&lt;ref name="Adams, MJ 13"/&gt; [[Phonics]] advocates assert that, to read a large vocabulary of words correctly and fluently requires detailed knowledge of the structure of the English language, particularly spelling-speech patterns.&lt;ref name="Adams, MJ 23,24"&gt;{{cite book |author=Adams, Marilyn Jager |title=Beginning to read: thinking and learning about print |publisher=MIT Press |location=Cambridge, Massachusetts |year=1995 |pages=23, 24 |isbn=0-262-51076-6 |oclc=469305891 |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whole Language  advocates assert that students do not need to be able to sound out words, but should look at unknown words and figure them out using context.&lt;ref name="Adams, MJ 23,24"/&gt;

===Research===
In 2000, the [[National Reading Panel]] (NRP) issued a report based on a meta-analysis of published research on effective reading instruction. The report found varying evidence-based support for some common approaches to teaching reading.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Report of the National Reading Panel: Teaching Children to Read|url=http://www.nichd.nih.gov/publications/nrp/findings.cfm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Phonemic awareness====
The NRP called phonemic awareness (PA) instruction "impressive":

:Overall, the findings showed that teaching children to manipulate phonemes in words was highly effective under a variety of teaching conditions with a variety of learners across a range of grade and age levels and that teaching phonemic awareness to children significantly improves their reading more than instruction that lacks any attention to PA.
:
The report singles out PA instruction based on teaching children to manipulate phonemes with letters as highly effective. Phonemic awareness instruction also improved spelling in grade-level students, although it did not improve spelling in disabled readers.

===Lexical reading===
Lexical reading&lt;ref name='Neural Representations'/&gt;&lt;ref name='Ventral and Dorsal Streams'/&gt;&lt;ref name='Changes Reading Strategies'/&gt;&lt;ref name='Chinese Ventral and Dorsal Streams'/&gt; involve acquiring words or phrases without attention to the characters or groups of characters that compose them or by using [[Whole language]] learning and teaching methodology. Sometimes argued to be in competition with phonics methods, and that the whole language approach tends to impair learning how to spell.

Historically, the two camps have been called [[Whole Language]] and [[Phonics]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://jan.ucc.nau.edu/jar/Reading_Wars.html|title=Reading Wars: Phonics vs. Whole Language|last=Reyhner|first=Jon|website=jan.ucc.nau.edu|access-date=2018-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;, although the Whole Language instructional method has also been referred to as "literature-based reading program" and "integrated language arts curriculum".&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Chall, Jeanne S. and Helen M. Popp, Teaching and Assessing Phonics: Why, What, When and How, Educators Publishing Service, 1996&lt;/ref&gt; Currently (2007), the differing perspectives are frequently referred to as "balanced reading instruction" (Whole Language) and "scientifically-based reading instruction" (Phonics).&lt;ref&gt;Louisa Moats, Whole Language Lives On: The
Illusion of "Balanced" Reading Instruction, The Fordham Foundation, Oct 2000. Downloaded from http://www.edexcellence.net/doc/moats.pdf July 30, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Whole Word ====

Whole word, also known as "Sight Word" and "Look and Say", teaches reading skills and strategies in the context of authentic literature.  Word recognition accuracy is considered less important than meaning accuracy; therefore, there is an emphasis on comprehension as the ultimate goal.

Students in this method memorize the appearance of words, or learn to recognize words by looking at the first and last letter from rigidly selected vocabularies in progressive texts (such as ''The [[Cat in the Hat]]''). Often preliminary results show children taught with this method have higher reading levels than children learning phonics, because they learn to automatically recognise a small selection of words.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Adams|first=Marilyn|title=Beginning to Read:  Thinking and Learning About Print|year=1995|publisher=The MIT Press|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|pages=38}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, later tests demonstrate that literacy development becomes stunted when hit with longer and more complex words later.&lt;ref name="Adams, MJ 23,24"/&gt;

===Sub-lexical reading===
Sub-lexical reading,&lt;ref name='Neural Representations' &gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Borowsky R, Esopenko C, Cummine J, Sarty GE |title=Neural representations of visual words and objects: a functional MRI study on the modularity of reading and object processing |journal=Brain Topogr |volume=20 |issue=2 |pages=89–96 |year=2007 |pmid=17929158 |doi=10.1007/s10548-007-0034-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name='Ventral and Dorsal Streams' &gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Borowsky R, Cummine J, Owen WJ, Friesen CK, Shih F, Sarty GE |title=FMRI of ventral and dorsal processing streams in basic reading processes: insular sensitivity to phonology |journal=Brain Topogr |volume=18 |issue=4 |pages=233–9 |year=2006 |pmid=16845597 |doi=10.1007/s10548-006-0001-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name='Changes Reading Strategies'&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Sanabria Díaz G, Torres Mdel R, Iglesias J, etal |title=Changes in reading strategies in school-age children |journal=Span J Psychol |volume=12 |issue=2 |pages=441–53 |date=November 2009 |pmid=19899646 |doi=10.1017/S1138741600001827}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name='Chinese Ventral and Dorsal Streams' &gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Chan ST, Tang SW, Tang KW, Lee WK, Lo SS, Kwong KK |title=Hierarchical coding of characters in the ventral and dorsal visual streams of Chinese language processing |journal=NeuroImage |volume=48 |issue=2 |pages=423–35 |date=November 2009 |pmid=19591947 |doi=10.1016/j.neuroimage.2009.06.078}}&lt;/ref&gt; involves teaching reading by associating characters or groups of characters with sounds or by using [[Phonics]] learning and teaching methodology. Sometimes argued to be in competition with whole language methods.

==== Phonics ====
{{Main|Phonics}}
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|jstor=27530006|title=What Research Says about Phonics Instruction|first=Nila B.|last=Smith|date=1 January 1957|publisher=|journal=The Journal of Educational Research|volume=51|issue=1|pages=1–9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Smith|first=Nila B.|date=September 1957|title=What Research Says about Phonics Instruction|jstor=27530006|journal=The Journal of Educational Research|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis, Ltd.|volume=51|issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Phonics refers to an instructional method for teaching children to read. The method teaches sounds to be associated with letters and combinations of letters.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Moats, Louisa |title=Spelling: development, disabilities, and instruction |publisher=York Press |location=Baltimore, Md |year=1995 |pages= |isbn=0-912752-40-8 |oclc=33404834 |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; "[[Phonics]]" is distinct from the [[linguistics]] terms "[[phoneme]]" and "[[phonetics]]", which refer to sounds and the study of sounds respectively.{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}}

Varieties of phonics include:

* [[Whole language|Embedded phonics]] is an instructional approach where letter sounds are taught opportunistically, as the need arises and in meaningful contexts, such as the reading of a storybook. Embedded phonics is often associated with a whole language approach to teaching reading.{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}}
* [[Synthetic phonics]] and analytic phonics are different but popular methods of teaching phonics. Synthetic and analytic phonics approaches both generally involve explicit, carefully sequenced instruction that teach a large body of phonics patterns.{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}}
** [[Synthetic phonics]] emphasizes the one-to-one correspondences between [[phonemes]] and [[graphemes]]. In synthetic phonics programs students say the sounds for the graphemes they see and orally blend them together to produce a spoken word. In the context of phonics, the word "[[wikt:blend|blend]]" takes on a different meaning from its use in [[linguistics]].
** In analytic phonics, students often learn phonograms, the [[syllable rime|rime]] parts of words including the vowel and what follows it. Students are taught to generalize the [[Phonogram (linguistics)|phonogram]] to multiple words. The phonogram ''-ail'' can be used to read ''fail, trail, mail, wail, sail'', and other words.{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}}

The [[Samuel Orton|Orton phonography]], originally developed to teach brain-damaged adults to read, is a form of phonics instruction that blends synthetic and analytic components. Orton described 73 "phonograms", or letter combinations, and 23 rules for spelling and pronunciation which Orton claimed would allow the reader to correctly pronounce and spell all but 123 of the 13,000 most common English words.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.eslhq.com/forums/esl-articles/teaching-reading-121/|title=Teaching of Reading - ESL Articles - eslHQ|website=www.eslhq.com|language=en|access-date=2017-02-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Pronunciation guides ====
In contrast to phonics which teaches the pronunciation rules of English, a new technology [[Phonetically Intuitive English]] directly shows English words' pronunciation by adding diacritical marks on them. This solves the problem that pronunciation rules can often be confusing (for example, "ea" has a wide range of diverse pronunciations in "speak", "steak", "bread", "Korea", "reality", "create" and "ocean").

The pronunciation-guide approach has been proven very successful in reading education for languages with very complex orthography such as Chinese. [[Pinyin]] and [[Zhuyin]] are systems of phonetic transcription for Mandarin Chinese used in [[China]] and [[Taiwan]] respectively, and are printed above or next to Chinese characters in children's books, textbooks and newspapers as a pronunciation guide, and have enabled Chinese-speaking countries to achieve high literacy rates for one of the most difficult languages in the world.

=== Other instructional methods ===

===Guided Reading===
During guided reading teachers work with small groups of students. These are students with similar reading levels. Students will read with teachers in books at their personal reading level, not where the grade level is at. During this time the teachers will work with students to practice decoding, fluency, vocabulary and comprehension skills.

====Native reading====
Some methods of mix phonics and whole word. Native reading, for example, differs from both in that it emphasizes teaching reading beginning at a very early age, when the human brain is neurodevelopmentally most receptive to learning language.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nativereading.com/introduction.html Native Reading Chapter 1] by Timothy Kailing&lt;/ref&gt; Native readers learn to read as toddlers, starting at the same time they learn to speak, or very soon thereafter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Kailing | first = Timothy D. | title = Native Reading | publisher = Elliptical Research Books |year=2008 | isbn = 978-1-4348-4881-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Reading Workshop ====
Reading Workshop is based on the premise that readers need time to read and discuss their reading.  Readers need access to a wide variety of reading materials of their choice. Classrooms must acquire a wide variety of reading materials to accommodate this need. Readers need to respond to the text and demonstrate quality literate behaviors. There is not a script to follow but a frame work to guide instruction.  Students are exposed to a variety of learning experiences.  There is time for student collaboration and a time for engaged reading.&lt;ref name="Serafini"&gt;{{cite web|last=Serafini|first=Frank |url=http://www.frankserafini.com/MainPages/WorkshopHandouts.html |title=Workshop Handouts Serafini, F. (2008) |work= |accessdate=March 26, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During reading workshop, the teacher models a whole-group strategy lesson and then gives students large blocks of time to read and to practice the strategy.  This practice can occur independently, with partners, or in small groups with a book or text chosen by the student.  The teacher moves around the room and confers with the students about their reading.  The teacher can meet with small, flexible groups to provide additional needs-based instruction.  At the end of the workshop the whole groups comes together to share their learning.&lt;ref name="Goudvis"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Anne Goudvis |author2=Stephanie Harvey |title=Strategies that work: teaching comprehension for understanding and engagement |publisher=Stenhouse Publishers |location=York, Me |year=2007 |pages=37–38 |isbn=1-57110-481-X |oclc=232347335 |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Examples of Improving Reading===
An adult or peer reads with the student by modeling fluent reading and then asking the student to read the same passage aloud with encouragement and feedback by the adult or peer.
A student listens to a tape of a fluent reader reading text at the student's independent level at a pace of about 80-100 words a minute. The student listens to the tape the first time and then practices reading along with the tape until the student is able to read fluently.
The student reads with a peer partner. Each partner takes a turn reading to the other. A more fluent reader can be paired with a less fluent reader to model fluent reading. The more fluent reader can provide feedback and encouragement to the less fluent reader. Students of similar reading skills can also be paired, particularly if the teacher has modeled fluent reading and the partner reading involves practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What Is Guided Oral Reading?|url=http://www.readingrockets.org/article/what-guided-oral-reading|website=Reading Rockets|accessdate=4 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The following is a list of the seven important strategies that all readers must be able to apply to text in order to read and understand content. The seven strategies are:
* 1.	Making Connections;
* 2.	Creating Mental Images;
* 3.	Making Inferences/Drawing Conclusions;
* 4.	Asking Questions;
* 5.	Determining What Is Important;
* 6.	Synthesizing; and
* 7.	Monitoring Comprehension and Meaning.&lt;ref name="Serafini"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Goudvis"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Miller, Debbie S. |title=Reading with meaning: teaching comprehension in the primary grades |publisher=Stenhouse Publishers |location=York, Me |year=2002 |pages=53–157 |isbn=1-57110-307-4 |oclc=48773960 |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Reading comprehension ====
{{Main|Reading comprehension}}

Reading comprehension requires making sense of text, which allows a reader to gain knowledge, enjoy a story, and make connections with the larger world.&lt;ref name="Cain 2009"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cain|first=Kate|title=Making Sense of Text:  Skills That Support Text Comprehension and Its Development|journal=Expert Perspectives on Interventions for Reading: A Collection of Best Practice Articles from the International Dyslexia Association|year=2009|pages= |url=http://www.eprints.lancs.ac.uk/26618/1/Cain2009IDAPerspectives.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; Several skills support reading comprehension, including making predictions and inferences, monitoring understanding, using text structures, and using prior knowledge effectively.&lt;ref name="Cain 2009"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Duffy 2009"&gt;{{cite book|last=Duffy|first=Gerald|title=Explaining Reading:  A Resource for Teaching Concepts, Skills, and Strategies|year=2009|publisher=The Guilford Press|location=New York|isbn=978-1-60623-075-6|pages=19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two of the most important aspects of successful comprehension are activating prior knowledge and metacognition, which are two of the principles of learning identified in the National Research Council's report.''&lt;ref name="Donovan"&gt;{{cite book|last=Donovan|first=M.

Many studies have identified the importance of prior knowledge in reading comprehension.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Carr|first=S. C.|author2=B. Thompson |title=The Effects of Prior Knowledge and Schema Activation Strategies on the Inferential Reading Comprehension of Children With and Without Learning Disabilities|journal=Learning Disability Quarterly|year=1996|volume=19|issue=1|pages=49 |url=http://www.eric.ed.gov/ERICWebPortal/search/detailmini.jsp?_nfpb=true&amp;_&amp;ERICExtSearch_SearchValue_0=EJ519854&amp;ERICExtSearch_SearchType_0=no&amp;accno=EJ519854 |accessdate=2/7/2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Many researchers have shown that having some prior knowledge about the topic of a passage enables both greater comprehension of the text and better memory for it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Priebe SJ, Keenan JM, Miller AC |title=How Prior Knowledge Affects Word Identification and Comprehension |journal=Read Writ |volume=7 |issue= |pages=581–586 |date=July 2011 |pmid=21799586 |doi=10.1007/s11145-010-9260-0 |url= |pmc=3142886}}&lt;/ref&gt;  "if we have prior knowledge about a topic in a text, we construct meaning based on our experience, and we can adjust and change those plans as we go along."&lt;ref name="Duffy 2009"/&gt; Some authors specify two types of prior knowledge necessary for successful comprehension.

Another learning principle that greatly influences reading comprehension is the use of metacognition.  The 'metacognitive' approach to instruction can help students learn to take control of their own learning by defining learning goals and monitoring their progress in achieving them."&lt;ref name="Donovan"/&gt; A great deal of research indicates that accomplished readers "monitor their comprehension as they read by engag[ing] in strategic processing, such as rereading previous text, to resolve comprehension failure."&lt;ref name="Cain 2009"/&gt; Students who are not able to track their own understanding gain neither information or enjoyment from reading as they do not know how to obtain meaning from the text.{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}}

Many strategies have been applied.&lt;ref name="McNamara 2009"/&gt;&lt;ref name="McKeown 2009"/&gt;  Many studies point to the success of strategy instruction, particularly for students who are poor comprehenders.&lt;ref name="McNamara 2009"/&gt;&lt;ref name="McKeown 2009"/&gt; Some strategies that have been helpful are summarization, question generation, making predictions and inferences, image making, knowledge and use of text structure, rereading, self-regulation, activation of prior knowledge, questioning the author, and using graphic organizers.&lt;ref name="Cain 2009"/&gt;&lt;ref name="McNamara 2009"/&gt;&lt;ref name="McKeown 2009"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Tolman|first=Carol|title=Working Smarter, Not Harder:  What Teachers of Reading Need to Know and Be Able to Teach|journal=Expert Perspectives on Interventions for Reading: A Collection of Best-Practice Articles from the International Dyslexia Association|year=2012|pages= |url=http://www.winsorlearning.com/site/resources/articles/working-smarter-not-harder/ }}&lt;/ref&gt; The variety of strategies allows the teacher to choose a strategy or strategies to suit the text and the needs of the student.{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}}

For an example of a specific intervention incorporating four strategies for comprehension building, utilized reciprocal teaching to model summarizing, questioning, clarifying, and predicting.&lt;ref name="PalinscarBrown1984"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Palinscar|first1=Aannemarie Sullivan|last2=Brown|first2=Ann L.|title=Reciprocal Teaching of Comprehension-Fostering and Comprehension-Monitoring Activities|journal=Cognition and Instruction|volume=1|issue=2|year=1984|pages=117–175|issn=0737-0008|doi=10.1207/s1532690xci0102_1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The authors indicate that they choose these skills due to their dual functions as "comprehension-fostering and comprehension monitoring activities."&lt;ref name="PalinscarBrown1984"/&gt;  The reciprocal teaching method, which involves the teacher modeling the designated activities and gradually turning the procedure over to the students themselves, uses Vygotsky's idea of scaffolding.  In this process, "children first experience a particular set of cognitive activities in the presence of experts, and only gradually come to perform these functions by themselves.&lt;ref name="PalinscarBrown1984"/&gt;  In this study, the students who participated in the reciprocal teaching intervention showed dramatic improvement in comprehension scores and maintained them for at least eight weeks.&lt;ref name="PalinscarBrown1984"/&gt;

==== Non-traditional approaches ====
Programs have been established to provide certified therapy animals, such as dogs, as non-judgmental "listeners" to build motivation and help children build proficiency and gain confidence in their reading ability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://westhartford.patch.com/groups/schools/p/read-benefits-all-readers-in-bugbee-classroom |title=Reading with Dogs Benefits All in Bugbee Classroom |last=Newton |first=Ronni (editor) |date=June 21, 2013 |website=West Hartford Patch |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6IHPAQiGk |archivedate=July 21, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Success rate of reading education in the US==
{{Main|Literacy in the United States}}

National literacy rates range from about 10 percent to 99+ percent.

There are several approaches used to teach reading and the U.S. Office of Education Cooperative Research Program has a compilation of these.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=How to Teach Balanced Reading and Writing|last=Burns|first=Bonnie|publisher=Corwin Press|year=2006|isbn=1412937418|location=Thousand Oaks, CA|pages=51}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, there is a list based on 29 individual studies that identify effective approaches when teaching reading for beginners. The bulk of the studies revealed that successful instructional strategies include [[Synthetic phonics|systematic phonics]] and approaches that focus on connected reading and meaning. These strategies were proved to be more effective than basal alone approaches. Specific studies that show instructional models that achieve high success rates in reading education include the so-called Actual Community Empowerment (ACE) program, which is a small-group tutoring framework that focuses on fluency, [[word recognition]], decoding and the concept of comprehension that is based on the appropriate pace of learning according to individual learning profiles.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Community Action Research: Benefits to Community Members and Service Providers|last=Reeb|first=Roger|publisher=Haworth Press|year=2006|isbn=9780789030467|location=New York|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The program, thus, has different variations. Once ACE was implemented in 40 locations in [[Philadelphia]], learners posted a 95 percent success rate for significant reading improvement.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Traditional reading instruction approaches that are considered effective include those under a [[Cognitive model|cognitive-based model]], which treats reading acquisition and reading comprehension to be dependent on [[Cognitive development|cognitive development.]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Cognitive Revolution on Educational Psychology|last=Royer|first=James|publisher=Information Age Publishing|year=2006|isbn=1593111630|location=Greenwich, CT|pages=28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Print exposure ==
[[Print exposure]] the amount of time a child or person spends being visually aware of the written word (reading)--whether that be through newspapers, magazines, books, journals, scientific papers, or more. Research has shown that the amount of print material that a child accesses has deep cognitive consequences. In addition, the act of reading itself, for the most part irrespective of what is being read, increases the achievement difference among children.{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}}

Children who are exposed to large amounts of print often have more success in reading and have a larger vocabulary to draw from than children who see less print. The average conversations among college graduates, spouses or adult friends contain less rare (advanced) words than the average preschool reading book. Other print sources have increasingly higher amounts of rare words, from children's books, to adult books, to popular magazines, newspapers, and scientific articles (listed in increasing level of difficulty). Television, even adult news shows, do not have the same level of rare words that children's books do.{{Citation needed|date=May 2012|author=Massaro, D. W.|title=Two Different Communication Genres and Implications for Vocabulary Development and Learning to Read. Journal of Literacy Research December 2015 47: 505–527, first published on February 17, 2016 .}}

The issue is that oral language is very repetitive. To learn to read effectively a child needs to have a large vocabulary. Without this, when the child does read they stumble over words that they do not know, and have trouble following the idea of the sentence. This leads to frustration and a dislike of reading. When a child is faced with this difficulty he or she is less likely to read, thus further inhibiting the growth of their vocabulary.

Children who enjoy reading do it more frequently and improve their vocabulary. A study of out-of-school reading of fifth graders, found that a student in the 50th percentile read books about 5 minutes a day, while a student in the 20th percentile read books for less than a minute a day. This same study found that the amount of time a child in the 10th percentile spent reading in two days, was the amount of time a child in the 90th percentile spent reading all year.{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}}

Print exposure can also be a big factor in learning English as a second language. [[Book flood]] experiments are an example of this. The book flood program brought books in English to the classroom. Through focusing their English language learning on reading books instead of endless worksheets the teachers were able to improve the rate at which their students learned English.{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}}

== Alphabetic principle and English orthography ==
{{Main|Alphabetic principle}}

Beginning readers must understand the concept of the ''alphabetic principle'' in order to master basic reading skills. A [[writing system]] is said to be ''alphabetic'' if it uses symbols to represent individual language sounds. In comparison, [[Logogram#Logographic systems|Logographic writing systems]] such as [[Japanese writing system|Japanese]] [[kanji]] and [[Written Chinese|Chinese]] [[Chinese characters|hanzi]] use a symbol to represent a word. And both cultures also use [[syllabary|syllabic writing systems]] such as Japanese [[kana]] and Chinese [[Yi script]], there are also many Chinese alphabets.

English is one of several languages using the [[Latin Alphabet]] [[writing system]]. The [[orthographic depth]] of such languages varies. The [[Italian orthography|Italian]] and [[Finnish language]]s have the purest, or shallowest orthographies, and [[English orthography]] is the deepest or most complex. In the shallow [[Spanish language|Spanish]] orthography; most words are spelled the way they sound, that is, word spellings are almost always regular. English orthography, on the other hand, is far more complex in that it does not have a one-to-one correspondence between symbols and sounds. English has individual sounds that can be represented by more than one symbol or symbol combination. For example, the long |a| sound can be represented by a-[[consonant]]-e as in ate, -ay as in hay, -ea as in steak, -ey as in they, -ai as in pain, and -ei as in vein. In addition, there are many words with irregular spelling and many [[homophones]] (words that sound the same but have different meanings and often different spellings as well). Pollack Pickeraz (1963) asserted that there are 45 phonemes in the [[English language]], and that the 26 letters of the English alphabet can represent them in about 350 ways.

The irregularity of English spelling is largely an artifact of how the language developed.
English is a [[West Germanic languages|West Germanic]] language with substantial influences and additional vocabulary from [[Latin]], [[Greek language|Greek]], and [[French language|French]], among others. Imported words usually follow the spelling patterns of their language of origin.&lt;ref name="King 2000"&gt;{{cite book |author=Diana Hanbury King |title=English isn't crazy!: the elements of our language and how to teach them |publisher=York Press |location=Baltimore, Md |year=2000 |pages=xii, 15|isbn=0-912752-59-9 |oclc=45166702 |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Advanced English phonics instruction includes studying words according to their origin, and how to determine the correct spelling of a word using its language of origin.

Clearly, the complexity of [[English orthography]] makes it more difficult for children to learn decoding and encoding rules, and more difficult for teachers to teach them.&lt;ref name="King 2000"/&gt; However, effective [[word recognition]] relies on the basic understanding that letters represent the sounds of spoken language, that is, word recognition relies on the reader's understanding of the [[alphabetic principle]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Adams|first=Marilyn|title=Beginning to Read:  Thinking and Learning About Print|year=1995|publisher=The MIT Press|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|pages=29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Spelling reform ===

Attempts to make English spelling behave phonetically have given rise to various campaigns for [[spelling reform]]; none have been generally accepted. Opponents of simplified spellings point to the impossibility of phonetic spelling for a language with many diverse accents and dialects. Several distinguished scholars, however, have thoroughly disproven all reasonable objections to spelling reform, including this objection. See, for example, ''Dictionary of Simplified American Spelling.''&lt;ref&gt;Rondthaler, Edward and Edward J. Lias, ''Dictionary of Simplified American Spelling'' (New York: The American Language Academy, 1986)&lt;/ref&gt; Thomas Lounsbury presented a devastating rebuttal to all reasonable objections to spelling reform in 1909.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Lounsbury, Thomas Raynesford |title=English spelling and spelling reform |publisher=Greenwood Press |location=Westport, Conn |year=1970 |pages=331–341 |isbn=0-8371-4264-4 |oclc=134359 |url=https://archive.org/details/englishspellings00lounuoft|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A shorter rebuttal of all the reasonable objections to spelling reform was made by Bob C Cleckler in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Bob C. Cleckler |title=Lets End Our Literacy Crisis: The Desperately Needed Idea Whose Time Has Come |publisher=American University &amp; Colleges Press |location=Salt Lake City |year=2005 |pages=166–170 |isbn=1-58982-230-7 |oclc=636405856 |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Linguists documenting the sounds of speech use various special symbols, of which the [[International Phonetic Alphabet]] is the most widely known. Linguistics makes a distinction between a [[Phone (phonetics)|phone]] and phoneme, and between [[phonology]] and [[phonetics]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://esl.fis.edu/grammar/langdiff/phono.htm|title=Language differences - Phonetics and phonology|last=Shoebottom|first=Paul|website=esl.fis.edu|access-date=2018-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The study of words and their structure is [[Morphology (linguistics)|morphology]], and the smallest units of meaning are [[morpheme]]s&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ntid.rit.edu/sea/processes/wordknowledge/grammatical/whatare|title=What are Morphemes? {{!}} SEA - Supporting English Acquisition|website=www.ntid.rit.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The study of the relationship between words present in the language at one time is [[etymology|synchronic etymology]], part of [[descriptive linguistics]], and the study of word origins and evolution is [[etymology|diachronic etymology]], part of [[historical linguistics]]

[[English orthography]] gives priority first to morphology, then to etymology, and lastly to phonetics. Thus the spelling of a word is dependent principally upon its structure, its relationship to other words, and its language or origin. It is usually necessary to know the meaning of a word in order to spell it correctly, and its meaning will be indicated by the similarity to words of the same meaning and family&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.myenglishlanguage.com/linguistics-language-guide/english-orthography/|title=English Orthography - The English Writing System - English Spelling|work=My English Language|access-date=2018-06-15|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

[[English language|English]] uses a 26 letter [[Latin alphabet]], but the number of [[grapheme]]s is expanded by several [[Digraph (orthography)|digraphs]], [[Trigraph (orthography)|trigraphs]], and [[tetragraph]]s, while the letter "q" is not used as a grapheme by itself, only in the digraph "qu"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theschoolrun.com/what-is-a-grapheme|title=What is a grapheme?|work=TheSchoolRun|access-date=2018-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

Each grapheme may represent a limited number of phonemes depending on [[etymology]] and location in the word. Likewise each phoneme may be represented by a limited number of graphemes. Some letters are not part of any grapheme, but function as etymological markers. Graphemes do not cross [[morpheme]] boundaries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://prowritingaid.com/art/317/What-are-Phonemes,-Graphemes,-and-Digraphs.aspx|title=What is the Difference Between a Phoneme, a Grapheme and a Digraph?|website=prowritingaid.com|language=en|access-date=2018-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Morphemes are spelled consistently, following rules inflection and word-formation, and allow readers and writers to understand and produce words they have not previously encountered&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.tesol-direct.com/tesol-resources/english-grammar-guide/morphemes/|title=Morphemes in English grammar {{!}} TESOL Direct|work=TESOL Direct|access-date=2018-06-15|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

==== Initial teaching alphabet ====
{{Main|Initial teaching alphabet}}
This method was designed to overcome the fact that English orthography has a many-to-many relationship between graphemes and phonemes. The method fell into disuse because children still had to learn the [[Latin alphabet]] and the conventional English spellings in order to integrate with society outside of school. It also recreated the problem of dialect dependent spelling, which the standardization of spelling had been created to eliminate&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://itafoundation.org/about-us/what-is-i-t-a/|title=Initial Teaching Alphabet Foundation {{!}}   What is i.t.a.?|website=itafoundation.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

=== Augmenting spelling with pronunciation information ===

Unlike spelling reforms, we can actually keep a word's original spelling intact but add pronunciation information to it, e.g. using diacritics. [[Phonetically Intuitive English]] is a Chrome browser extension that automatically adds such a pronunciation guide to English words on Web pages, for English-speaking children to recognize a written word's pronunciation and therefore map the written word to the mental word in his mind.

== Practical application ==

In practice, many children are exposed to both "Phonic" and "Whole Language" methods, coupled with reading programs that combine both elements&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.allaboutlearningpress.com/whole-language-or-phonics-which-approach-is-best|title=Whole Language or Phonics: Which Approach Is Best?|website=www.allaboutlearningpress.com|language=en|access-date=2018-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;. For example, the extremely popular book, ''Teach Your Child to Read in 100 Easy Lessons'', by Siegfried Engelman, et al. ({{ISBN|0-671-63198-5}}), teaches pronunciation and simple phonics, then supplements it with progressive texts and practice in directed reading. The end result of a mixed method is a casually phonetic student, a much better first-time pronouncer and speller, who still also has look-say acquisition, quick fluency and [[Reading comprehension|comprehension]]. Using an eclectic method, students can select their preferred learning style. This lets all students make progress, yet permits a motivated student to use and recognize the best traits of each method&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.observerbd.com/2015/02/13/72233.php|title=Eclectic approach to teaching language|website=www.observerbd.com|access-date=2018-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

[[Speed reading]] continues where basic education stops. Usually after some practice, many students' reading speed can be significantly increased. There are various speed-reading techniques&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/tim-ferriss/speed-reading_b_5317784.html|title=How I Learned to Read 300 Percent Faster in 20 Minutes|last=Ferriss|first=Tim|date=2014-05-13|website=Huffington Post|language=en-US|access-date=2018-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

However, speed reading does not guarantee comprehension or retention of what was read.

[[Readability]] indicates the ease of understanding or comprehension due to the style of writing&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.profweb.ca/en/publications/articles/using-readability-analysis-to-make-students-stronger-writers|title=Using readability analysis to make students stronger writers|website=Profweb|language=en|access-date=2018-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;. [[Reading recovery]] is a method for helping students learn to read&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://readingrecovery.org/reading-recovery/teaching-children/basic-facts/|title=Basic Facts - Reading Recovery Council of North America|work=Reading Recovery Council of North America|access-date=2018-06-15|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

== History ==
[[File:Alice-gorham-burt-1905.png|upright|thumb|1905 edition cover of ''Alice's Adventures in Wonderland retold in words of one syllable'']]
In colonial times, reading instruction was simple and straightforward: teach children the code and then let them read. At that time, reading material was not specially written for children but consisted primarily of the Bible and some patriotic essays; the most influential early textbook was ''[[The New England Primer]],'' published late 1680s. There was little consideration for how best to teach children to read or how to assess reading comprehension.
&lt;ref name="Adams, 1990"&gt;{{cite book |author=Adams, Marilyn Jager |title=Beginning to read: thinking and learning about print |publisher=MIT Press |location=Cambridge, Massachusetts |year=1990 |pages=21–25 |isbn=0-262-01112-3 |oclc=256731826 |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Not until the mid-19th century did this approach change significantly. Educators, in particular [[Horace Mann]], began to advocate changes in reading instructional methods. He observed that children were bored and "death-like" at school, and that instruction needed to engage children's interest in the reading material by teaching them to read whole words.&lt;ref name="Adams, 1990"/&gt; The [[McGuffey Readers]] (1836) were the most popular of these more engaging [[graded reader]]s. In the mid-19th century, [[Kate Harrington (Poet)|Rebecca Smith Pollard]] developed a sequential reading program of intensive synthetic phonics, complete with a separate teacher's manual and [[spelling]] and [[Reading (process)|reading]] books&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.k12academics.com/reading-education-united-states/history-reading-education-us|title=History of Reading Education in the U.S. {{!}} K12 Academics|last=Glavin|first=Chris|date=2014-02-06|website=www.k12academics.com|language=en|access-date=2018-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

From the 1890s to at least 1910, A. L. Burt of New York and other publishing companies published series of books aimed at young readers, using simple language to retell longer classics. Mrs J. C. Gorham produced three such works, ''Gulliver's Travels in words of one syllable'' (1896), ''[[Alice's Adventures in Wonderland retold in words of one syllable]]'' (1905), and ''Black Beauty retold in words of one syllable'' (1905). In the UK, Routledge published a similar series between 1900 and 1910.

The meaning-based curriculum did not dominate reading instruction until the second quarter of the 20th century. Beginning in the 1930s and 1940s, reading programs became very focused on comprehension and taught children to read whole words by sight. [[Phonics]] was not to be taught except sparingly and as a tool to be used as a last resort.&lt;ref name="Adams, 1990"/&gt;

In the 1950s [[Rudolf Flesch]] wrote a book called ''Why Johnny Can't Read'',&lt;ref name="Flesch, R"&gt;{{cite book |author=Flesch, Rudolf Franz |title=Why Johnny can't read: and what you can do about it |publisher=Harper &amp; Row |location=San Francisco |year=1986 |pages= |isbn=0-06-091340-1 |oclc=12837722 |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; a passionate argument in favor of teaching children to read using [[phonics]].&lt;ref name="Adams, 1990"/&gt; Addressed to the mothers and fathers of America, he also hurled severe criticism at publishers' decisions that he claimed were motivated by profit, and he questioned the honesty and intelligence of experts, schools, and teachers.&lt;ref name="Adams, 1990"/&gt; The book was on the best seller list for 30 weeks and spurred a hue and cry in general population. It also polarized the reading debate among educators, researchers, and parents.&lt;ref name="Adams, 1990"/&gt;

This polarization continues to the present time. In the 1970s an instructional philosophy called [[whole language]] (which de-emphasizes teaching phonics out of context) was introduced, and it became the primary method of [[Reading (process)|reading]] instruction in the 1980s and 1990s&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.helpingeverychildtoread.com/index.php/causes-of-difficulty/reading-theories/whole-word-method|title=Whole Word Method|website=www.helpingeverychildtoread.com|language=en-gb|access-date=2018-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;. During this time, researchers (such as the [[National Institute of Health]]) conducted studies showing that early [[Learning to read|reading acquisition]] depends on the understanding of the connection between sounds and letters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Adams, Marilyn Jager |title=Beginning to read: thinking and learning about print |publisher=MIT Press |location=Cambridge, Massachusetts |year=1994 |pages= |isbn=0-262-51076-6 |oclc=256731826 |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The sight-word (Whole Word) method was invented by Rev. [[Thomas H. Gallaudet]], the director of the American Asylum at Hartford in the 1830s&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sightwords.com/sight-words/lessons/|title=Sight Words Teaching Strategy {{!}} Sight Words: Teach Your Child to Read|website=www.sightwords.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="21617">In [[differential geometry]], the '''Ricci curvature tensor''', named after [[Gregorio Ricci-Curbastro]], represents the amount by which the [[volume element|volume]] of a narrow conical piece of a small   [[geodesic]] [[ball (mathematics)|ball]] in a curved [[Riemannian manifold]] deviates from that of the standard ball in [[Euclidean space]].  As such, it provides one way of measuring the degree to which the geometry determined by a given [[Riemannian metric]] might differ from that of ordinary Euclidean {{mvar|n}}-space. The Ricci tensor is defined on any [[pseudo-Riemannian manifold]], as a [[trace (mathematics)|trace]] of the [[Riemann curvature tensor]].  Like the metric itself, the Ricci tensor is a [[symmetric bilinear form]] on the [[tangent space]] of the manifold {{harv|Besse|1987|p=43}}.&lt;ref&gt;It is assumed that the manifold carries its unique [[Levi-Civita connection]]. For a general [[affine connection]], the Ricci tensor need not be symmetric.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[relativity theory]], the Ricci tensor is the part of the [[curvature of spacetime]] that determines the degree to which matter will tend to converge or diverge in time (via the [[Raychaudhuri equation]]).  It is related to the matter content of the universe by means of the [[Einstein field equation]].  In differential geometry, lower bounds on the Ricci tensor on a Riemannian manifold allow one to extract global geometric and topological information by comparison (cf. [[comparison theorem]]) with the geometry of a constant curvature [[space form]].  If the Ricci tensor satisfies the vacuum Einstein equation, then the manifold is an [[Einstein manifold]], which have been extensively studied (cf. {{harvnb|Besse|1987}}).  In this connection, the [[Ricci flow]] equation governs the evolution of a given metric to an Einstein metric; the precise manner in which this occurs ultimately leads to the [[solution of the Poincaré conjecture]].

==Definition==
Suppose that {{math|(''M'', ''g'')}} is an {{mvar|n}}-dimensional [[Riemannian manifold]], equipped with its [[Levi-Civita connection]] {{math|∇}}.  The [[Riemannian curvature tensor]] of {{mvar|M}} is the {{nowrap|(1, 3)}}-tensor defined by
:&lt;math&gt;R(X,Y)Z = \nabla_X\nabla_Y Z - \nabla_Y\nabla_XZ - \nabla_{[X,Y]}Z&lt;/math&gt;
on [[vector field]]s {{math|''X'', ''Y'', ''Z''}}.  Let {{mvar|T&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;M}} denote the [[tangent space]] of {{mvar|M}} at a point {{mvar|p}}. For any pair of tangent vectors {{mvar|ξ}} and {{mvar|η}} in {{mvar|T&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;M}}, the Ricci tensor {{math|Ric}} evaluated at {{math|(''ξ'', ''η'')}} is defined to be the [[trace (linear algebra)|trace]] of the linear map {{math|''T&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;M'' → ''T&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;M''}} given by
:&lt;math&gt;\zeta \mapsto R(\zeta,\eta) \xi.&lt;/math&gt;
In [[local coordinates]] (using the [[Einstein summation convention]]), one has
:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Ric} = R_{ij}\,dx^i \otimes dx^j&lt;/math&gt;
where
:&lt;math&gt;R_{ij} = {R^k}_{ikj}.&lt;/math&gt;

In terms of the [[Riemann curvature tensor]] and the [[Christoffel symbols]], one has
:&lt;math&gt;R_{\alpha\beta} = {R^\rho}_{\alpha\rho\beta} =
\partial_{\rho}{\Gamma^\rho}_{\beta\alpha} - \partial_{\beta}{\Gamma^\rho}_{\rho\alpha}
+ {\Gamma^\rho}_{\rho\lambda} {\Gamma^\lambda}_{\beta\alpha}
- {\Gamma^\rho}_{\beta\lambda}{\Gamma^\lambda}_{\rho\alpha}
= 2 {\Gamma^\rho}_{\alpha[\beta,\rho]} +
2 {\Gamma^\rho}_{\lambda [\rho} {\Gamma^\lambda}_{\beta]\alpha}.&lt;/math&gt;

Due to the symmetries of the Riemann curvature tensor, it is possible for there to be a disagreement on the [[Sign_convention#Curvature|sign convention]], since 

:&lt;math&gt;R_{\alpha\beta} =-{R^\rho}_{\alpha\beta\rho}   &lt;/math&gt;,

==Properties==

As a consequence of the [[Bianchi identities]],  the Ricci tensor of a Riemannian manifold is [[symmetric tensor|symmetric]], in the sense that
:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Ric}(\xi ,\eta) = \operatorname{Ric}(\eta ,\xi).&lt;/math&gt;
It thus follows that the Ricci tensor is completely determined by knowing the quantity {{math|Ric(''ξ'',''ξ'')}} for all vectors {{mvar|ξ}} of unit length. This function on the set of unit tangent vectors is often simply called the '''Ricci curvature''', since knowing it is equivalent to knowing the Ricci curvature tensor.

The Ricci curvature is determined by the [[sectional curvature]]s of a Riemannian manifold, but generally contains less information. Indeed, if {{mvar|ξ}} is a vector of unit length on a Riemannian {{mvar|n}}-manifold, then {{math|Ric(''ξ'',''ξ'')}} is precisely {{math|(''n'' − 1)}} times the average  value of the sectional curvature, taken over all the 2-planes containing {{mvar|ξ}}.  There is an {{math|(''n'' − 2)}}-dimensional family of such 2-planes, and so only in dimensions 2 and 3 does the Ricci tensor determine the full curvature tensor. A notable exception is when the manifold is given a priori as a [[hypersurface]] of [[Euclidean space]]. The [[second fundamental form]], which determines the full curvature via the [[Gauss–Codazzi equations|Gauss–Codazzi equation]], is itself determined by the Ricci tensor and the [[Principal curvature|principal directions]] of the hypersurface are also the [[eigendirection]]s of the Ricci tensor. The tensor was introduced by Ricci for this reason.

If the Ricci curvature function {{math|Ric(''ξ'',''ξ'')}} is constant on the set of unit tangent vectors {{mvar|ξ}}, the Riemannian manifold is said to have constant Ricci curvature, or to be an [[Einstein manifold]].  This happens if and only if the Ricci tensor Ric is a constant multiple of the metric tensor {{mvar|g}}.

The Ricci curvature is usefully thought of as a multiple of the [[Laplacian]] of the metric tensor {{harv|Chow|Knopf|2004|loc=Lemma 3.32}}.  Specifically, in [[harmonic coordinates|harmonic]] local coordinates the components satisfy
:&lt;math&gt;R_{ij} = -\tfrac12\Delta \left(g_{ij}\right) + \text{lower-order terms} ,&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\Delta=\nabla\cdot\nabla&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Laplace–Beltrami operator]], here regarded  as acting on the functions {{mvar|g&lt;sub&gt;ij&lt;/sub&gt;}}. This fact motivates, for instance, the introduction of the [[Ricci flow]] equation as a natural extension of the [[heat equation]] for the metric. Alternatively, in a [[normal coordinates|normal coordinate system]] based at {{mvar|p}}, at the point {{mvar|p}}
:&lt;math&gt;R_{ij} = -\tfrac23\Delta \left(g_{ij}\right).&lt;/math&gt;

==Direct geometric meaning==

Near any point {{mvar|p}} in a Riemannian manifold {{math|(''M'',''g'')}}, one can define preferred local coordinates, called [[geodesic normal coordinates]]. These are adapted to the metric so that geodesics through {{mvar|p}} correspond to straight lines through the origin, in  such a manner that the geodesic distance from {{mvar|p}} corresponds to the  Euclidean distance from the origin.  In these coordinates, the metric tensor is well-approximated by the Euclidean metric, in the precise sense that
:&lt;math&gt;g_{ij} = \delta_{ij} + O \left(|x|^2\right) .&lt;/math&gt;
In fact, by taking the [[Taylor expansion]] of the metric applied to a [[Jacobi field]] along a radial geodesic in the normal coordinate system, one has
:&lt;math&gt;g_{ij} = \delta_{ij} - \tfrac13 R_{ikjl}x^kx^l + O\left(|x|^3\right) .&lt;/math&gt;
In these coordinates, the metric [[volume element]] then has the following expansion at {{mvar|p}}:

:&lt;math&gt;d\mu_g = \left[ 1 - \tfrac16 R_{jk}x^jx^k+ O\left(|x|^3\right) \right] d\mu_{\rm Euclidean} ,&lt;/math&gt;

which follows by expanding the square root of the [[determinant]] of the metric.

Thus, if the Ricci curvature {{math|Ric(''ξ'',''ξ'')}} is positive in the direction of a  vector {{mvar|ξ}}, the conical region in {{mvar|M}} swept out by a tightly focused family of  geodesic segments of length &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon&lt;/math&gt; emanating from {{mvar|p}}, with initial velocity inside a small cone about {{mvar|ξ}}, will
have smaller volume than the corresponding conical region in Euclidean space, at least provided that  &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon&lt;/math&gt; is sufficiently small. 
Similarly, if the Ricci curvature is negative in the direction of a given vector {{mvar|ξ}}, such a conical region in the manifold will instead have larger volume than it would in Euclidean space.

The Ricci curvature is essentially an average of curvatures in the planes including {{mvar|ξ}}. Thus if a cone emitted with an initially circular (or spherical) cross-section becomes distorted into an ellipse ([[ellipsoid]]), it is possible for the volume distortion to vanish if the distortions along the [[Principal axis theorem|principal axes]] counteract one another. The Ricci curvature would then vanish along {{mvar|ξ}}. In physical applications, the presence of a nonvanishing sectional curvature does not necessarily indicate the presence of any mass locally; if an initially circular cross-section of a cone of [[worldline]]s later becomes elliptical, without changing its volume, then this is due to tidal effects from a mass at some other location.

== Applications ==

Ricci curvature plays an important role in [[general relativity]], where it is the key term in the [[Einstein field equation]]s.

Ricci curvature  also appears in  the [[Ricci flow]] equation, where a time-dependent Riemannian metric is deformed in the direction of minus its Ricci curvature. This system of partial differential equations is a non-linear analog of the [[heat equation]], and was first introduced by [[Richard S. Hamilton]] in the early 1980s. Since heat tends to spread through a solid until the body reaches an equilibrium state of constant temperature, Ricci flow may be hoped to produce an equilibrium geometry for a manifold for which the Ricci curvature is constant. Recent contributions to the subject due to [[Grigori Perelman]] now show that this program works well enough in dimension three  to lead to a complete classification of compact 3-manifolds, along lines first conjectured by [[William Thurston]] in the 1970s.

On a [[Kähler manifold]], the  Ricci curvature determines the first [[Chern class]] of the manifold (mod torsion). However, the Ricci curvature has no analogous topological interpretation on a generic Riemannian manifold.

==Global geometry and topology==

Here is a short list of global results concerning manifolds with positive Ricci curvature; see also [[Riemannian geometry#Local to global theorems|classical theorems of Riemannian geometry]]. Briefly, positive Ricci curvature of a Riemannian manifold has strong topological consequences, while (for dimension at least 3), negative Ricci curvature has ''no'' topological implications. (The Ricci curvature is said to be '''positive''' if the Ricci curvature function {{math|Ric(''ξ'',''ξ'')}} is positive on the set of non-zero tangent vectors {{mvar|ξ}}.)  Some results are also known for pseudo-Riemannian manifolds.

#[[Myers theorem|Myers' theorem]] states that if the Ricci curvature is bounded from below on a complete Riemannian manifold by {{math|(''n'' − 1)''k'' &gt; 0}}, then the manifold  has diameter {{math|≤ {{sfrac|π|{{sqrt|''k''}}}}}}, with equality only if the manifold is [[Isometry|isometric]] to a sphere of a constant curvature {{mvar|k}}. By a covering-space argument, it follows that any compact  manifold of positive Ricci curvature must  have  finite [[fundamental group]].
#The [[Bishop–Gromov inequality]] states that if  a complete {{mvar|m}}-dimensional Riemannian manifold has non-negative Ricci curvature,  then the volume of a ball is less than or equal to the volume of a ball of the same radius in Euclidean {{mvar|m}}-space. Moreover, if {{math|''v&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;''(''R'')}} denotes the volume of the ball with center {{mvar|p}} and radius {{mvar|R}} in the manifold and {{math|''V''(''R'') {{=}} ''c&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;R&lt;sup&gt;m&lt;/sup&gt;''}} denotes the volume of the ball of radius {{mvar|R}} in Euclidean {{mvar|m}}-space then the function {{math|{{sfrac|''v&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;''(''R'')|''V''(''R'')}}}} is nonincreasing. (The last inequality can be generalized to arbitrary curvature bound and is the key point in the proof of [[Gromov's compactness theorem (geometry)|Gromov's compactness theorem]].)
#The Cheeger–Gromoll [[splitting theorem]] states that if a complete Riemannian manifold with {{math|Ric ≥ 0}} contains a  ''line'', meaning  a geodesic {{mvar|γ}} such that {{math|''d''(''γ''(''u''),''γ''(''v'')) {{=}} {{abs|''u'' − ''v''}}}} for all {{math|''u'', ''v'' ∈ ℝ}}, then it is isometric to a product space {{math|ℝ × ''L''}}. Consequently, a complete manifold of positive Ricci curvature can have at most one topological end.  The theorem is also true under some additional hypotheses for complete [[Lorentzian manifold]]s (of metric signature {{math|(+ − − ...)}}) with non-negative Ricci tensor ({{harvnb|Galloway|2000}}).

These results show that positive Ricci curvature has strong topological consequences.  By contrast, excluding the case of surfaces, negative
Ricci curvature is now known to have ''no'' topological implications; {{harvtxt| Lohkamp|1994}} has shown that any manifold of dimension greater than two admits a Riemannian metric of negative Ricci curvature. (For surfaces, negative Ricci curvature implies negative sectional curvature; but the point is that this fails rather dramatically in all higher dimensions.)

== Behavior under conformal rescaling ==

If the metric {{mvar|g}} is changed by multiplying it by a conformal factor {{math|''e''&lt;sup&gt;2''f''&lt;/sup&gt;}}, the Ricci tensor of the new, conformally-related metric {{math|''g̃'' {{=}} ''e''&lt;sup&gt;2''f''&lt;/sup&gt;''g''}} is given  {{harv|Besse|1987|p=59}} by

&lt;!--PLEASE DON'T CHANGE \Delta TO -\Delta.  The sign is correct for our Laplacian convention (and agrees with the cited source).--&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\widetilde{\operatorname{Ric}}=\operatorname{Ric}+(2-n)\left[ \nabla df-df\otimes df\right]+\left[\Delta f -(n-2)\|df\|^2\right]g ,&lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|1=Δ {{=}} ''d''*''d''}} is the (positive spectrum) Hodge Laplacian, i.e., the ''opposite'' of the usual trace of the Hessian.

In particular, given a point {{mvar|p}} in a Riemannian manifold, it is always possible to find metrics conformal to the given metric {{mvar|g}} for which the Ricci tensor vanishes at {{mvar|p}}. Note, however, that this is only pointwise assertion; it is usually impossible to make the Ricci curvature vanish identically on the entire manifold by a conformal rescaling.

For two dimensional manifolds, the above formula shows that if {{mvar|f}} is a [[harmonic function]], then the conformal scaling {{math|''g'' ↦ ''e''&lt;sup&gt;2''f''&lt;/sup&gt;''g''}} does not change the Ricci tensor (although it still changes its trace with respect to the metric unless f=0).

==Trace-free Ricci tensor==
In [[Riemannian geometry]] and [[general relativity]], the '''trace-free Ricci tensor''' of a pseudo-Riemannian manifold {{math|(''M'',''g'')}} is the tensor defined by

:&lt;math&gt;Z = \operatorname{Ric}- \frac{S}{n}g ,&lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|Ric}} is the Ricci tensor, {{mvar|S}} is the [[scalar curvature]], {{mvar|g}} is the [[metric tensor]], and {{mvar|n}} is the dimension of {{mvar|M}}. The name of this object reflects the fact that its [[Trace (linear algebra)|trace]]  automatically vanishes:

:&lt;math&gt;Z_{ab}g^{ab}= 0.&lt;/math&gt;

If {{math|''n'' ≥ 3}}, the trace-free Ricci tensor vanishes identically if and only if

:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Ric} = \lambda g&lt;/math&gt;

for some constant {{mvar|λ}}.

In mathematics, this is the condition for {{math|(''M'',''g'')}} to be an [[Einstein manifold]]. In physics, this equation states that {{math|(''M'',''g'')}} is a solution of Einstein's vacuum field equations with [[cosmological constant]].

==Kähler manifolds==
On a [[Kähler manifold]] {{mvar|X}}, the Ricci curvature determines the [[curvature form]] of the [[canonical bundle|canonical line bundle]] {{harv|Moroianu|2007|loc=Chapter 12}}.  The canonical line bundle is the top [[exterior power]] of the bundle of holomorphic [[Kähler differential]]s:

:&lt;math&gt;\kappa = \wedge^n \Omega_X.&lt;/math&gt;

The Levi-Civita connection corresponding to the metric on {{mvar|X}} gives rise to a connection on {{mvar|κ}}. The curvature of this connection is the two form defined by

:&lt;math&gt;\rho(X,Y)\,\stackrel{\text{def}}{=}\,\operatorname{Ric}(JX,Y)&lt;/math&gt;

where {{mvar|J}} is the [[complex manifold|complex structure]] map on the tangent bundle determined by the structure of the Kähler manifold. The Ricci form is a [[closed and exact forms|closed]] 2-form. Its [[cohomology class]] is, up to a real constant factor, the first [[Chern class]] of the canonical bundle, and is therefore a topological invariant of {{mvar|X}} (for compact {{mvar|X}}) in the sense that it depends only on the topology of {{mvar|X}} and the [[homotopy class]] of the complex structure.

Conversely, the Ricci form determines the Ricci tensor by

:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Ric}(X,Y) = \rho(X,JY).&lt;/math&gt;

In local holomorphic coordinates {{mvar|z&lt;sup&gt;α&lt;/sup&gt;}}, the Ricci form is given by

:&lt;math&gt;\rho = -i\partial\overline{\partial}\log\det\left(g_{\alpha\overline{\beta}}\right)&lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|∂}} is the [[Dolbeault operator]] and

:&lt;math&gt;g_{\alpha\overline{\beta}} = g\left(\frac{\partial}{\partial z^\alpha},\frac{\partial}{\partial {\overline{z}}^\beta}\right).&lt;/math&gt;

If the Ricci tensor vanishes, then the canonical bundle is flat, so the [[G-structure|structure group]] can be locally reduced to a subgroup of the special linear group {{math|SL(''n'','''C''')}}.  However, Kähler manifolds already possess [[holonomy]] in {{math|U(''n'')}}, and so the (restricted) holonomy of a Ricci-flat Kähler manifold is contained in {{math|SU(''n'')}}. Conversely, if the (restricted) holonomy of a {{math|2''n''}}-dimensional Riemannian manifold is contained in {{math|SU(''n'')}}, then the manifold is a Ricci-flat Kähler manifold {{harv|Kobayashi|Nomizu|1996|loc=IX, §4}}.

==Generalization to affine connections==
The Ricci tensor can also be generalized to arbitrary [[affine connection]]s, where it is an invariant that plays an especially important role in the study of [[projective differential geometry|projective geometry]] (geometry associated to unparameterized geodesics) {{harv|Nomizu|Sasaki|1994}}.  If {{math|∇}} denotes an affine connection, then the curvature tensor {{mvar|R}} is the (1,3)-tensor defined by

:&lt;math&gt;R(X,Y)Z = \nabla_X\nabla_Y Z - \nabla_Y\nabla_XZ - \nabla_{[X,Y]}Z&lt;/math&gt;

for any vector fields {{math|''X'', ''Y'', ''Z''}}. The Ricci tensor is defined to be the trace:

:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{ric}(X,Y) = \operatorname{tr}\big(Z\mapsto R(Z,X)Y\big).&lt;/math&gt;

In this more general situation, the Ricci tensor is symmetric if and only if there exist locally a parallel [[volume form]] for the connection.

== Constructs ==

The social norms approach is founded upon a set of assumptions that individuals incorrectly perceive that the attitudes or behaviors of others are different from their own, when in reality they are similar. This phenomenon is known as [[pluralistic ignorance]].&lt;ref name=berk2005&gt;Berkowitz, A. D. (2005). "An overview of the social norms approach". In L. Lederman &amp; L. Stewart (Eds.), ''Changing the culture of college drinking: A socially situated health communication campaign (193-214)''. Creskill, New Jersey: Hampton Press.&lt;/ref&gt; It is largely because individuals assume the most memorable and salient, often extreme, behavior is representative of the behavior of the majority. This may lead individuals to adjust their behavior to that of the presumed majority by adhering to the pseudo-norms created by observing such memorable behavior. These exaggerated perceptions, or rather misperceptions, of peer behavior will continue to influence the habits of the majority, if they are unchallenged.&lt;ref name=perk2003/&gt; This means that individuals may be more likely to enact problem behaviors and suppress healthier practices, making support for healthy behaviors much less visible at an aggregate level. This effect has been documented for alcohol, [[illegal drug use]], [[smoking]], other health behaviors, and attitudes, such as [[prejudice]].&lt;ref name=berk2005/&gt;

A phenomenon known as [[false consensus]] is closely related to the idea of pluralistic ignorance, and refers to the incorrect belief that others are similar, when in reality they are not. For example, heavy drinkers will think that most others consume as much as they do, and will use this belief to justify their behavior. Berkowitz,&lt;ref name=berk2005/&gt; an independent consultant who works full-time to promote these ideas, describes false consensus and pluralistic ignorance as "mutually reinforcing and self-perpetuating...the majority is silent because it thinks it is a minority, and the minority is vocal because it believes that it represents the majority" (p.&amp;nbsp;194).

These phenomena both have the potential to be addressed by a social norms intervention. Berkowitz&lt;ref name=berk2004&gt;Berkowitz, A. D. (2004). [http://www.alanberkowitz.com/articles/social_norms.pdf ''The Social Norms Approach: Theory, Research and Annotated Bibliography'']. Retrieved 1 July 2008&lt;/ref&gt; describes this possibility in relation to reducing alcohol use:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
…social norms interventions have been found to be effective in changing the behavior of the moderate or occasional-drinking majority (pluralistic ignorance) as well as confronting and changing the behavior of the heavy drinking minority ([[false consensus]]) (p. 9)
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Thus, the social norms approach predicts that an [[Health intervention|intervention]] which aims to correct misperceptions by exposing actual [[norm (sociology)|norms]] will benefit society as well as individuals, because it will lead people to reduce problem behaviors or increase participation in healthy behaviors.&lt;ref name=berk2005/&gt; There have been multiple studies which have indeed shown that social norms campaigns can have such positive effects on target populations. One study in particular, which utilized 18 different colleges over a three-year period, found that social norms campaigns were associated with lower perceptions of student drinking and lower consumption levels.&lt;ref&gt;DeJong, W., Schneider, S. K., Towvim, L. G., Murphy, M. J., Doerr, E. E., Simonsen, N. R., et al. (2006). "A multisite randomized trial of social norms marketing campaigns to reduce college student drinking". ''Journal of Studies on Alcohol'', 67, 868-879.&lt;/ref&gt;  Oddly, when the results of this same study were reported at a conference of alcohol educators, DeJong reported that [[alcohol consumption]] increased' among both control participants and among the experimental group (those who got the social norms marketing treatment).  This discrepancy in reported findings between a conference paper and published journal paper is difficult to reconcile.

Another intervention designed to reduce drinking amongst student athletes had similar results, reducing misperceptions of alcohol consumption. Also, within the time period of the intervention, there were declines in personal consumption, high risk drinking, and alcohol-related consequences.&lt;ref&gt;Perkins, H. W. &amp; Craig, D. W. (2006).  "A successful social norms campaign to reduce alcohol misuse among college student-athletes". ''Journal of Studies on Alcohol'', 67, 868-879.&lt;/ref&gt;  When critiquing this study, one should ask how many dependent variables were assessed, as this group of researchers often assesses as many as 20 or more outcome variables and finds change in 2 or 3 and calls the program successful.

A recent trial of a live, interactive, normative feedback program in which students used keypads to input information had positive effects in terms of reducing misperceptions and drinking behavior.&lt;ref&gt;LaBrie, J. W., Hummer, J. F., Neighbors, C., &amp; Pedersen, E. R. (2008). "Live interactive group-specific normative feedback reduces misperceptions and drinking in college students: A randomized cluster trial". ''Psychology of Addictive Behaviors'', 22, 141-148.&lt;/ref&gt; There are many other examples of successful social norms campaigns, which cover various topics, population sizes, and [[Mass media|media]] through which normative messages are conveyed.

=== Types of norms ===
{{Refimprove|date=July 2015}}
{{citations broken|date=November 2015}}
Two [[Norm (social)#Types|types of norms]] are relevant to a social norms approach: descriptive norms and [[injunctive norm]]s. Injunctive norms involve perceptions of which behaviors are typically approved or disapproved. They assist an individual in determining what is acceptable and unacceptable social behavior. This would be the morals of your interpersonal networks and surrounding community. Descriptive norms involve perceptions of which behaviors are typically performed. They normally refer to the perception of others' behavior. These norms are based on observations of those around you &lt;ref name=cialdini2003&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Cialdini |first1=Robert |title=Crafting Normative Messages to Protect the Environment |journal=Current Directions in Psychological Science |date=2003 |volume=12 |issue=4 |pages=105–109 |doi=10.1111/1467-8721.01242 |citeseerx=10.1.1.579.5154 }}&lt;/ref&gt;.

"Both kinds of norms motivate human action; people tend to do what is socially approved as well as what is popular. (105) When put together, these norms have a counterproductive effect.
For example a campaign that focuses individuals on the frequent occurrences of an offense against the environment has the  potential to increase the occurrence of that offense" &lt;ref name=cialdini2003/&gt;.
These two norms are constructed from three sources: observable behavior, direct/indirect communication and self-knowledge. Miller and Prentice 1996

*'''Observable behavior''': Observing others behavior is the easiest form of norm information. However it is susceptible to the fundamental attribution error. The fundamental attribution error is the tendency of individuals to view other's behavior as a trait rather than a factor influenced by situational variables (Ross 1997)
*'''Direct/Indirect:''' " direct (what words mean) and indirect (what words imply) communication, also has its flaws. Information may be distorted intentionally or unintentionally." (Ross 1997)
*''' Self:''' Personal attitudes and behaviors also have an influence over the perception of norms However it is highly susceptible to "''the false consensus effect"''
*The false consensus effect is when a person thinks that others think and act as they do. (Mullen and Hu)
*These different sources of information about norms can sometimes lead to inaccurate perceptions about other's behaviors and attitudes (Miller and Prentice 1996)

Borsari and Carey's&lt;ref name=borsari&gt;Borsari, B. &amp; Carey, K. B. (2003) "Descriptive and Injunctive Norms in College Drinking: A Meta-Analytic Integration". ''Journal of Studies on Alcohol'', 64, 331-341.&lt;/ref&gt;[[meta-analysis]] of studies showed that people misperceive injunctive norms more than they do descriptive norms, and that injunctive norms are more likely to predict drinking behavior and negative consequences of drinking. However, the use of both in social norms campaigns has shown that it is unclear which type of norm is more likely to change behavior.&lt;ref name=berk2004/&gt;

=== Assumptions ===

There are seven [[:wikt:assumption|assumptions]] of the social norms approach:&lt;ref name=berk2005/&gt;

*Actions are often based on misinformation about or misperceptions of others' attitudes and/or behavior.
*When misperceptions are defined or perceived as real, they have real consequences.
*Individuals passively accept misperceptions rather than actively intervening to change them, hiding from others their true perceptions, feelings, or beliefs.
*The effects of misperceptions are self-perpetuating because they discourage the expression of opinions and actions that are falsely believed to be nonconforming while encouraging problem behaviors that are falsely believed to be normative.
*Appropriate information about the actual norm will encourage individuals to express those beliefs that are consistent with the true, healthier norm, and inhibit problem behaviors that are inconsistent with it.
*Individuals who do not personally engage in the problematic behavior may contribute to the problem by the way in which they talk about the behavior. Misperceptions thus function to strengthen beliefs and values that the "carriers of the misperception" do not themselves hold and contribute to the climate that encourages problem behavior.
*For a norm to be perpetuated it is not necessary for the majority to believe it, but only for the majority to believe that the majority believes it.

==History==

Since the 1986 study in which Berkowitz and Perkins reported the misperceptions about alcohol consumption amongst [[college student]]s, the use and study of the social norms approach has grown. It has been used as a prevention technique for a variety of levels of prevention: universal, with large populations like entire college campuses; selective, with targeted subpopulations, and indicated, with individuals.&lt;ref name=berk2005/&gt;

The first social norms [[Health intervention|intervention]] was implemented in 1989 by Michael Haines at [[Northern Illinois University]], which targeted a universal campus population and over the years has shown significant success in terms of increasing healthy behaviors.&lt;ref name="Haines, M. P 2003"&gt;Haines, M. P, Barker, G. P. &amp; Rice, R. (2003). "Using Social Norms to Reduce Alcohol and Tobacco Use in Two Midwestern High Schools". In H. W. Perkins (Ed.), ''The Social Norms Approach to preventing school and college age substance abuse: A handbook for educators, counselors, clinicians'' (Chapter 14). San Francisco: Jossey-Bass.&lt;/ref&gt; This research at Northern Illinois University was done with a $64,000 grant from the U.S.Department of Education Fund for the Improvement of Post Secondary Education (FIPSE). Many other universities have since followed suit and have had similar success in the reduction of high-risk drinking behaviors, such as [[Hobart and William Smith Colleges]],&lt;ref&gt;Perkins, H. W. &amp; Craig, D. A. (2003).

"Social norms program reduces measured and self-reported drinking at UNC-CH". ''The Report on Social Norms'': Working Paper #14, Little Falls, New Jersey, PaperClip Communications. (Available from alan@fltg.net)&lt;/ref&gt; to name a few.&lt;ref name="Ber"&gt;[http://www.montclair.edu/health/socialnorms/ Montclair-SNorms "Social Norms - Wellness - Montclair State University"]{{dead link|date=May 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, Montclair State University, 2008, states that Alan D. Berkowitz and H. Wesley Perkins first proposed the social norms approach. Alan Berkowitz is an independent "consultant who helps universities, colleges, public health agencies and communities design programs which address health and social justice" issues. Alan Berkowitz is Editor and founder of "The Report on Social Norms". Wes Perkins is a Professor of Sociology and spent much of his professional life studying and evaluating adolescents and young adults. H. Wesley Perkins has been evaluating Social Norms programs for thirty years.&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Report on Social Norms'': Working Paper #14, Little Falls, New Jersey, PaperClip Communications. (Available from alan@fltg.net)&lt;/ref&gt;

It has also gained widespread use targeting [[adolescents]] and [[high school]] students, and has been used in an attempt to reduce drinking and smoking behaviors amongst those populations.&lt;ref name="Haines, M.

Recently, [[Health intervention|interventions]] have been tested to reduce sexual assault, and the results were reported to be "promising".&lt;ref&gt;Berkowitz, A. D. (2007).

===Criticisms===
The social norms approach is not accepted by all scholars as an effective campaign method. Some criticize the approach by saying that the underlying assumptions are false. One study found that the perceived degree of alcohol use was not predictive of [[alcohol abuse]] if other [[normative]] influences were considered,&lt;ref&gt;Real, K.,&amp; Rimal, R. N. (2001, November). "Explaining the influence of perceived norms on behaviors: Implications for campaigns against alcohol abuse by college students". Paper presented at the annual meeting of the National Communication Association, Atlanta, Georgia.&lt;/ref&gt; and another study found that misperceptions of drinking problems were unrelated to personal alcohol consumption.&lt;ref&gt;Baer, J. S. &amp; Carney, M. M. (1993). "Biases in the perceptions of the consequences of alcohol use among college students". ''Journal of Studies on Alcohol'', 54, p.54-60.&lt;/ref&gt;
The findings of both of those studies present opposition to the first assumption of the social norms approach: Actions are often based on misinformation about or misperceptions of others' attitudes and/or behavior.

Other scholars challenge the legitimacy of social norms interventions deemed successful. They say that many of these interventions had [[methodological]] problems which could influence the validity of their effectiveness (e.g., they did not control for other variables, did not have comparison groups, etc.).&lt;ref name=weschler&gt;Wechsler, H., Nelson, T. F., Lee, J. E., Seibring, M., Lewis, C. &amp; Keeling, R. P. (2003).  "Perception and reality: A national evaluation of social norms marketing interventions to reduce college students' heavy alcohol use". ''Journal of Studies on Alcohol'', 64, 484-494.&lt;/ref&gt;
Another common criticism is that they are simply ineffective: a nationwide study, which compared colleges with social norms interventions to those that did not have them, found that schools with interventions showed no decreases in measures of alcohol use, and actually found increased measures in terms of alcohol consumed monthly and total amount consumed.&lt;ref name=weschler/&gt;
There are also a handful of studies that document failed social norms campaigns at specific colleges.&lt;ref&gt;Granfield, R (2002). "Can You Believe It? Assessing the Credibility of a Social Norms Campaign". ''The Report on Social Norms: Working Paper #2'', Little Falls, New Jersey: Paper-Clip Communications.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Werch, CCE, Pappas, DM, Carlson, JM, DiClemente, CC, Chally, PS &amp; Sinder, JA (2000). "Results of a Social Norm Intervention to Prevent Binge Drinking Among First-Year Residential College Students". ''Journal of American College Health'', 49: 85-92.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Clapp, JD, Lange, JE, Russell, C, Shillington, A &amp; Voas, RB (2003). "A Failed Social Marketing Campaign". ''Journal of Studies on Alcohol'', 64:409-414.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Lifecycle ==

A social norms approach determines the exaggerated and actual norms of a population through formative research, and then informs the population of the actual norms through a message campaign. The next step is determining the effectiveness of the messages through a [[summative evaluation]]. Finally, the results from the evaluative research can also be used to craft new messages to revise the message campaign, and thus the campaign is cyclical. The following provides a more in-depth description of the steps involved in a social norms campaign.

=== Formative evaluation ===
Formative evaluation is the first step in a social norms campaign and consists of surveying the population, as well as message creation based on the survey results. The formative evaluation phase is the time when information regarding perceived norms and actual behaviors is garnered from the audience. In order for a social norms approach to be the appropriate means for intervention, two conditions must first be satisfied:

*'''There must be misperceptions between actual behavior and perceived behavior''' – This simply means that there must be a difference between what people do and what they think other people do or believe. This difference must be a misperception in the direction of overestimation of problem behavior.  If there is no difference, the social norms approach is not appropriate. A caveat is that there is almost always a difference. Sometimes a more sensitive instrument is necessary to uncover the misperceptions.
*'''At least half of the population must behave "correctly"''' – If over half of the population behaves in a way that is contrary to the intervention, a social norms approach is not the best interventional strategy. Because a social norms approach assumes that individuals want to be normal, if most of the individuals (i.e., over 50%) behave in a way that is harmful, a social norms message campaign might encourage the harmful behavior. It is important to ask questions about both descriptive and injunctive norms.

=== Surveying ===
The most effective way to establish the baseline levels of behavior and perceptions is through the use of surveys. Internet surveys, for example, are an often-used method of generating a substantial response rate. They are especially suited for college students because of their familiarity with the technology, the containment of the population (i.e., all are part of a specific community), and the ability of the students to take the survey at their own pace and during the time that works best for them. Not only are web surveys ideal for students, but they are also highly advantageous for researchers. They provide quick turnaround for [[data analysis]], higher [[response rate (survey)|response rates]], less missing data, and they eliminate interviewer effects. Other possible methods of administering a survey are pencil and paper surveys, phone surveys, or personal interviews.

The following describes a typical and thorough process used to survey a population:
#'''Plan'''
#*Decide what topics will be covered
#*Decide when to administer the survey
#*Develop useful questions
#'''Acquire incentives to provide for respondents''' - There are two different types of incentives: Individual rewards and lottery rewards. Individual rewards are given to every person who completes the survey (e.g., a coupon for a free pizza). Lottery rewards are awarded to individuals at random (e.g., 10 people receive a $50 gift certificate). Individual rewards are more expensive but provide higher [[response rate (survey)|response rates]].
#'''[[Statistical survey|Survey]] Design'''
#'''Notifying the [[Sample (statistics)|Sample]]''' – Often, a double-barreled [[Methodology|method]] is used:
#*Pre-letter or pre-email notification – A personalized letter notification delivered several days before the survey opens. The letter includes the purpose and goal of the research, when and at what email address they will receive the email notification, how long the survey will be active, access information (IDs, pass codes), what they will get out of it (i.e., incentives), how their privacy will be protected, and contact information for the surveyors.
#*Email notification – This [[email]] repeats much of the information of the original letter, but also provides a link for the survey.
#*Reminder – A reminder often mentions previous notifications, sympathizes about why the respondent might not have completed the survey, mentions the importance of the survey, and includes the incentive information again.

===Creating a campaign ===
After completing [[data collection]], researchers then analyze the data and search for patterns, looking for inconsistencies between actual behavior, attitudes, and perceived norms. When these differences are consistent with the campaign and the majority of students adhere to the beneficial idea, they are then used in the next round of message creation. For example, the data could show that [[college student]]s report they consumed 0–4 drinks the last time they partied, but they believe that the average student consumed 5 or more drinks. After discovering this statistic, a researcher may craft a message like, "Most students drink 0–4 drinks when they party", to correct the misperceived descriptive norm.

The most important descriptive researchers look for in the data is the 51% or greater statistic, or items where "most" (i.e., over 50%) of the population adheres to the beneficial behavior. These statistics could occur in injunctive norms (i.e., "Most students believe passing out from drinking too much is wrong."), protective/healthy behaviors (i.e., "Most students use a [[designated driver]], even when only having one or two drinks."), or other numerous behaviors.

There are different message components that can be varied, which are experimented with during pre-testing. For example, researchers test different [[vocabulary]] (e.g., "66%" vs. "Most" vs. "Majority), using different behaviors to find out which ones are the easiest and most acceptable to perform (e.g., "eating while drinking" vs. "keeping track while drinking"), and using varying degrees of [[citations]] (e.g., large [[citations]] vs. small citations of data source). These preliminary messages are pretested on small groups in order to refine them before they are presented to the entire population. Other aspects examined in pretesting include which messages are most socially acceptable, which are believed to be the most effective, and which messages have the highest believability.

==== Believability ====
Believability is a necessary but not a [[sufficient condition]] for an effective campaign. If believability of messages is low, change will probably not occur because the [[persuasive]] messages are falling into the audience's latitude of rejection. In other words, the audience will reject the message without even considering it. It is also important to note, however, that if believability is extremely high (e.g., over 90%), change is also unlikely to occur because the message is not challenging enough. In other words, it serves only as a [[reinforcement]] rather than an element of change. Thus, while there are no specific [[guidelines]], it is ideal to aim for believability above 50%.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, S. W., Atkin, C. K., Martell, D., Allen, R., &amp; Hembroff, L. (2006). A Social Judgment Theory approach to conducting formative research in a social norms campaign. Communication Theory, 16, 141-152.&lt;/ref&gt;

In an assessment of the believability of a social norms campaign, Polonec, Major, and Atwood&lt;ref&gt;Polonec, L. D., Major, A. M., &amp; Atwood, L. E. (2006). "Evaluating the Believability and Effectiveness of the Social Norms Message "Most Students Drink 0 to 4 Drinks When They Party"." ''Health Communication'', 20, 23-34.&lt;/ref&gt; found that students' own drinking experiences and the experiences of their friends contributed to disbelief in the message "Most students on campus choose to have 0 to 4 drinks when they party." Another study found that disbelief may be due to preconceived notions about drinking that students develop even before they arrive on campus.&lt;ref&gt;Stewart, L. P., Lederman, L. C., Golubow, M., Cattafesta, J. L., Goodhart, F. W., Powell, R. L., et al. (2002). "Applying communication theories to prevent dangerous drinking among college students: The RU sure campaign". ''Communication Studies'', 53, 381–399.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Evaluation ===

After implementing a campaign, researchers then perform a summative evaluation which measures the success of the campaign. This step consists of examining and evaluating the progress made by an intervention through assessing the outcome and impact, [[cost and benefits]], and [[cost effectiveness]] of a program. It is typical for researchers to use surveys similar to those used in formative evaluation. The following are questions that a [[summative evaluation]] can answer:

*'''Did change occur in [[perceptions]]?''' A social norms approach is based on correcting misperceptions before changing behavior. The changes in behavior are thought to occur as an outcome of corrected perceptions. The goal is thus for the population to understand the prevalent behavior so they do not feel they have to live up to misperceived norms of behavior.  If there is a reduction in misperceptions, then the campaign has been implemented in a manner consistent with the social norms approach.
*'''How much change occurred?''' Is the difference significant or is it equally likely to have been caused by chance?
*'''Is the change associated with the intervention?''' Are the changes observed the result of some other factor or is there reason to believe the program was the basis for the change? This question can be answered by comparing the results with nationwide averages.
*'''How much did it cost?''' This is a method of weighing the benefits achieved by a program against its cost.

An especially important part of [[summative evaluation]] is the assessment of [[market saturation]] and reach. Clearly, if a social norms campaign does not reach very much of its intended audience, then its potential effectiveness decreases. If researchers can demonstrate that their campaign had high reach, then that strengthens the connection of the intervention to positive outcomes. It also lets researchers know what methods are effective for distributing the campaign.&lt;ref&gt;Perkins, H. W. &amp; Craig, D. A. (2002).

Newton, Massachusetts: The Higher Education Center for Alcohol and Other Drug Prevention.&lt;/ref&gt; It is necessary for an audience to be exposed to campaign messages frequently to change misperceptions. However, overexposure is possible, leading to a loss of [[credibility]] and [[habituation]].&lt;ref&gt;Johannessen, K.

== Glossary ==
The following are key terms discussed in this article that are relevant to the Social Norms Approach:

*'''[[Pluralistic ignorance]]''': the false assumption of an individual that the attitudes or behaviors of others are different from their own, when in fact they are similar.&lt;ref name=berk2005/&gt;
*'''[[False consensus]]''': the incorrect belief that others are similar to oneself, when in fact they are not.
*'''[[Norm (sociology)|Norms]]''': a [[pattern]] or [[trait theory|trait]] taken to be typical of the behavior of a [[social group]].&lt;ref name=berk2005/&gt;
*'''Descriptive norms''': Descriptive norms are concerned with what people actually do.  They refer to the perceptions of "the most common actions actually exhibited in a [[social group]],"&lt;ref name=perk2002&gt;Perkins, H. W. (2002). "Social norms and the prevention of alcohol misuse in collegiate contexts". ''Journal of Studies on Alcohol'', 14, 164-172.&lt;/ref&gt;(p.&amp;nbsp;165) such as the quantity and frequency of drinking, and are largely formed from observations of others' alcohol consumption. Park and Smith&lt;ref name=parksmith&gt;Park, H. S., &amp; Smith, S. W. (2007). "Distinctiveness and influence of [[subjective norm]]s, personal descriptive and [[injunctive norm]]s, and societal descriptive and injunctive norms on behavioral intent: A case of two behaviors critical to organ donation". ''Human Communication Research'', 93, 194-218.&lt;/ref&gt; found that descriptive norms can be perceived at both a personal and societal level, and define them as "individuals' beliefs regarding the popularity of the behavior in question", (p.&amp;nbsp;196)either among valued others or society at large.
*'''Injunctive norms''': Injunctive norms are concerned with what people feel is right based on [[morals]] or beliefs. Perkins&lt;ref name=perk2002/&gt; defines them as "widely shared beliefs or expectations in a social group about how people in general or members of the group ought to behave in various circumstances" (p.&amp;nbsp;165). Park and Smith&lt;ref name=parksmith/&gt; note that injunctive norms can also be perceived at a personal or a societal level, defining them as "individuals’ beliefs regarding approval or disapproval of the behavior in question", (p.&amp;nbsp;196) either by valued others or societal members.
*'''Formative evaluation''': The first step in a social norms campaign, which consists of surveying the population, as well as message creation based on the survey results. The formative evaluation phase is the time when information regarding perceived norms and actual behaviors is garnered from the audience.
*'''[[Summative evaluation]]''': The final step in a social norms campaign before the cycle begins again, which measures its success. It consists of examining and evaluating the progress made by an [[Health intervention|intervention]] through assessing the outcome and impact, [[cost and benefits]], and [[cost effectiveness]] of a program.

{{for|the actual death of players in sport|Sudden cardiac death of athletes}}
In a [[sport]] or [[game]], '''sudden death''' (also '''sudden-death overtime''' or a '''sudden-death round''') is a form of competition where play ends as soon as one competitor is ahead of the others, with that competitor becoming the winner.  Sudden death is typically used as a [[tiebreaker]] when a contest is tied at the end of the normal playing time or the completion of the normal playing task.

An alternative tiebreaker method is to play a reduced version of the original; for example, in [[association football]] 30 minutes of [[extra time]] (overtime) after 90 minutes of normal time, or in [[golf]] one playoff round (18 holes) after four standard rounds (72 holes).  Sudden-death playoffs typically end more quickly than these reduced replays.  Reducing the variability of the event's duration assists those scheduling television time and team travel. Fans may see sudden death as exciting and suspenseful, or they may view the format as insufficiently related to the sport played during regulation time; for example, prior to 2012, the [[National Football League]] ([[American football]]) used a sudden-death rule for overtime play.  In those situations, a team possessing the ball need only kick a field goal to end the game in their favor, negating the additional benefit that typically comes with scoring a touchdown.

Sudden death provides a victor for the contest without a specific amount of time being required.  It may be called "'''next score wins'''" or similar, although in some games, the winner may result from penalization of the other competitor for a mistake.  Sudden death may instead be called '''sudden victory''' to avoid the mention of death and serious disease, particularly in sports with a high risk of physical injury. This variant became one of announcer [[Curt Gowdy]]'s idiosyncrasies in 1971 when the AFC divisional championship game between the [[Kansas City Chiefs]] and [[Miami Dolphins]] went into overtime.

North American professional sports using a sudden-death method of settling a tied game include the modified version now employed by the  [[National Football League]], the [[National Hockey League]] and, also in a modified sense, the [[PGA Tour]] ([[golf]]).  [[Baseball]] uses a unique method of tie-breaking that incorporates elements of sudden death.  In some [[Goal (sport)|goal]]-scoring games sudden-death extra time may be given in which the first goal scored wins; in association football it is called the ''[[golden goal]]'', although this has not been recognised since it was abolished from the [[Laws of the Game (association football)|Laws of the Game]] in 2004 by [[FIFA]].  In baseball, a winning run scored by the home team in an extra inning is often referred to as a '''walk-off''', as the players can immediately walk off the field.

==American football==
Sudden death has been perceived as a particularly poor fit for [[gridiron football]] because the process gives an inherent advantage to the team who starts with possession of the ball: they can score and end the game immediately (even by driving a relatively short distance into [[field goal range]] and then kicking a [[Field goal (American and Canadian football)|field goal]]), but the team on defense cannot (other than through far rarer scoring strategies such as the [[Interception|pick-six]] or the [[Safety (American football score)|safety]]).

All organized forms of American football have abolished pure sudden death for overtime as of the 2011 season. Most levels of the game, including [[high school football]] and [[college football]], never used it, instead either allowing ties to stand or using alternatives like the [[Kansas Playoff]]. The [[National Football League]] was an exception; the league used pure sudden death in its playoffs beginning in 1940 and in regular season matchups starting in 1974, finally modifying its process for playoffs in 2010 and then regular season games in 2011.

===National Football League===
Originally, all [[National Football League]] games tied at the end of regulation time ended as a tie. Late in the 1940 season, NFL President [[Carl Storck]] announced that sudden death periods would be authorized for any playoff game needed to decide either division title.  It was emphasized that this did not apply to the final championship game, which would crown co-champions in the event of a tie.&lt;ref&gt;New York Times, November 19, 1940. [https://www.nytimes.com/1940/11/19/archives/novel-plan-adopted-to-decide-playoffs-pro-football-group-title.html Novel Plan Adopted to Decide Play-Offs],  p. 22&lt;/ref&gt;  Commissioner [[Elmer Layden]] approved a similar arrangement for the 1941 season, with the same limitation. In the years when it was within the rules, the [[NFL Championship Game]] only was tied in regulation in the 1958 NFL Championship Game. A tied game in regulation did not occur in the Super Bowl until [[Super Bowl LI]] (51).

Sudden death overtime was finally approved for the NFL championship game in 1946&lt;ref&gt;New York Times, April 30, 1946. Danzig, Allison, [https://www.nytimes.com/1946/04/30/archives/pro-giants-to-play-seven-home-games-all-national-league-elevens.html Pro Giants To Play Seven Home Games], p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt; and remains in effect now.&lt;ref&gt;New York Times, December 18, 1948, [https://www.nytimes.com/1948/12/18/archives/cards-and-eagles-evenly-matched-but-chicago-team-on-basis-of-strong.html Cards And Eagles Evenly Matched], p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;New York Times,  December 11, 1950, [https://www.nytimes.com/1950/12/11/archives/sudden-death-overtime-for-playoff-contests.html Sudden Death Overtime For Play-Off Contests], p. 33&lt;/ref&gt;  The first playoff game requiring overtime was the [[NFL Championship Game, 1958|1958 NFL Championship Game]].&lt;ref&gt;Gifford and Richmond, pg. 210&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1974, the NFL adopted a 15-minute sudden-death overtime period for regular-season games; in {{NFL year|2017}} it was cut to 10 minutes.  The game ended as a tie if neither team scores in overtime.  When a team gets near the [[end zone]], it typically tried to kick a [[Field goal (football)|field goal]].  An overtime game can also be won by scoring a [[touchdown]] (in such an event, the [[extra point]] is not attempted).  This usually happened on a play that began with field position far enough away from the end zone to make a field goal difficult if not impossible, but it can also result from a team choosing not to attempt a field goal until reaching fourth down, even if the team enters an easy field goal range; this strategy only works if the team can maintain possession of the ball and does not fumble the ball away, throw an interception or lose enough yardage to back out of field goal range.  Only thrice has an overtime game been won by a [[Safety (American football score)|safety]].  In recent years, sportscasters have referred to such scoring plays as "walk-offs," as both teams can walk off the field after the play.

Since the 2010–11 playoffs, in the post-season, each team was allowed at least one possession to score in overtime, unless the team receiving the kickoff scored a touchdown or if the defensive team scored a touchdown or safety on the same possession. True sudden death rules applied if both teams have had their initial possession and the game remains tied. This rule did not actually come into use during the 2010 playoffs, with the first overtime game under the new rules not occurring until 2011, with the [[Denver Broncos]] scoring a long touchdown on their first play from scrimmage against the [[Pittsburgh Steelers]]. 

This rule was adopted for the start of the 2012 regular season.  It was adopted to counter the criticism that the outcome of overtime games was very frequently decided by the coin toss, as the team which won it usually attempted only enough offensive action to maneuver into field goal range and seldom made a real effort to score a touchdown.  In the regular season, games still tied after one full overtime period will continue to be allowed to end in a tie.

For information on games that have taken a long time under sudden death, see [[Overtime (sports)#Longest games|Overtime]].

===Arena football===
In [[arena football]], each team is allowed one overtime possession in the first overtime, after which whoever is ahead is the winner.  If the score is still tied, however, true sudden death rules apply thereafter.  (A similar, modified sudden death format, with a 10-minute limit, was used in the [[NFL Europa#Experimental rules|NFL Europa]] League.) This rule was implemented in the [[2007 Arena Football League season|2007 season]]; prior to this, the league used [[Overtime (sports)|extra time]], a fixed seven and one-half minute extra period; if the game was still tied at this point, it was recorded as a tied game.  This was later changed to a fifteen-minute maximum modified sudden death as above, but with a definite conclusion after one overtime period, again a tied game being recorded if the score was still equal.  (Only one tied game was recorded under each of the two prior overtime rules.) Since the beginning of the 2007 season, all Arena football games, both regular season and playoff, have been played to a victorious conclusion.  Any succeeding overtime periods are true sudden death periods. An exception is applied to second game of the 2018 semifinal series, provided one team wins the first game and the second game ends with the two-game aggregate score tied, the game will continue with a standard overtime even if the score of the second game is not tied.

==Association football==

{{Main|Golden goal}}
Sudden death has a controversial history in [[association football]]. Important matches were traditionally resolved by replaying the entire match, however in the era of television and tight travel schedules this is often impracticable. Replays are still used in some major competitions (like the [[FA Cup]]).

In many matches, if the score is tied after the full 90 minutes, a draw results; however, if one team must be eliminated, some form of tie-breaking must occur. Originally, two 15-minute halves of [[Overtime (sports)#Association football|extra time]] were held and if the teams remained equal at the end of the halves, [[Penalty shoot-out (association football)|kicks from the penalty mark]] are held.

To try to decrease the chances of requiring kicks from the penalty mark, the [[International Football Association Board|IFAB]], the world law making body of the sport, experimented with new rules. The [[golden goal]] rule transformed the overtime periods into sudden death until the periods were over, where shootouts would occur. As this became unpopular, the [[silver goal]] rule was instituted, causing the game to end if the scores were not equal after the first 15-minute period as well as the second. The silver goal has also fallen into disrepute so [[UEFA Euro 2004]] was the last event to use it; after which the original tie-breaking methods were restored.

The main criticism of golden goal is the quickness of ending the game, and the pressure on coaches and players. Once a goal is scored, the game is over and the opponent cannot attempt to answer the goal within the remaining time. Therefore, teams would place more emphasis on not conceding a goal rather than scoring a goal, and many golden goal extra time periods remained scoreless.

In [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]] collegiate play in the United States, however, sudden death, adopted in 1997 for all championship play in addition to regular season play, remains. In 2005, the Division II Women's Championship game ended in sudden death as a goal was scored three minutes into the overtime to end the championship match.[http://www.soccertimes.com/ncaa/2005/wgames/dec03a.htm] Sudden death is also prevalent in youth play, for the safety of players.

If the teams are still tied after the initial allocated number in the penalty shoot-out, the game goes to sudden-death penalties, where each team takes a further one penalty each, repeated until only one team scores, resulting in the winning of the game.

==Badminton==
In [[badminton]], if a set is tied at 29-all, golden point is played; whoever scores this point wins it.

==Baseball and softball==
[[Baseball]] and [[softball]] are not true sudden-death sports, but they have one comparable situation.

Baseball and softball games cannot end until both teams have had an equal number of turns at bat, unless further play (by the home team if they lead after {{Frac|8|1|2}} innings) cannot affect the outcome.  In the final scheduled inning (typically, in professional and advanced amateur leagues the ninth inning, but usually the seventh for youth leagues and softball, and the sixth for leagues for subteens such as [[Little League]]), if the visitors complete their turn at bat and still trail the hosts, the game ends.  If the visitors lead or the game is tied, the hosts take their "last ups" at bat.  If the hosts should exceed the visitors' score, the game ends at the conclusion of the play on which the hosts take this insurmountable lead.  (If the final scheduled inning ends in a tie, multiple extra innings are played with the same implications as the final scheduled inning.)

The ability to bat last is an [[Home advantage|advantage of being the home team]].  It is said that "visitors must play to win; hosts need only play to tie" because tying forces an extra inning.

A tied game in the bottom of the final scheduled inning puts pressure on the visitors.  For example, with a runner on third base and fewer than two outs, the visitors cannot afford even to get certain types of out that would let the game-ending run score after the out.

A scoring play that ends the game is called a walk-off, because after the runner scores the winning run everyone can walk off the field.  A [[walk-off home run]] is an exception to the rule stated above; the game does not end when the winning run scores, but continues until the batter and all runners score (provided they run the bases correctly).

==Basketball==
[[Basketball]] does not traditionally employ sudden death to decide games; it instead uses multiple five-minute [[Overtime (sports)#Basketball|overtime]] periods to determine the result of games tied after regulation play. The entire overtime is played; if the game remains tied, this procedure is repeated.

The [[NBA Summer League]], a developmental summer league, employs sudden death basketball after the first overtime. The rules state ''Double overtime &amp; thereafter is sudden death (first team to score a point wins).'' In the first sudden death professional basketball game, [[Devin Ebanks]] hit a game winner with 45 seconds elapsed for the D-League Select team, beating the summer league [[Atlanta Hawks]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indystar.com/story/sports/nba/2014/07/13/nba-summer-league-introduces-sudden-death-basketball/12609323/|title=NBA Summer League introduces sudden death basketball|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another form of basketball does employ a sudden-death overtime. [[3x3 (basketball)|3x3]], a formalized version of the half-court three-on-three game, uses an untimed overtime period that ends by rule once either team has scored 2&amp;nbsp;points. In this form of the sport, shots taken from behind the "three-point" arc are worth 2&amp;nbsp;points and all other shots are worth 1&amp;nbsp;point.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fiba.com/pages/eng/fc/3x3/inside3x3/p/openNodeIDs/23267/selNodeID/23267/3x3-rules-of-the-game.html |title=3x3: Rules of the game |publisher=[[FIBA]] |accessdate=March 17, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fencing==
An individual [[Fencing (sport)|fencing]] bout lasts for five touches in a poule match, or 15 touches in a direct elimination (DE) match in all three weapons (épée, foil, and sabre.  Although sabre bouts rarely go to full-time, the same time frames apply)  Matches are also timed (three minutes for a poule match, and three periods of three minutes for a DE). If neither fencer has reached five or 15 points within the time limit, the leading fencer is deemed the winner. However, if the fencers are tied after the allotted time, one minute of extra time is added.

Before resuming the bout, one fencer is randomly awarded "priority". The first fencer to score a valid hit within extra time wins the match; if no valid hits are scored within the time, that fencer with priority is declared the victor.

In the normal course of a match, there is a de facto sudden death situation if both fencers are tied at four (or 14) touches each. The final hit is called "la belle". The fencers may salute each other before playing for the final point.

==Golf==
In individual [[match play]], players level after the regulation 18 or 36 holes will play extra holes in sudden death.  In team tournaments, players may gain half a point each for a tie rather than play sudden death; this is the case in the [[Ryder Cup]], for example. In the [[Presidents Cup]], there was provision for a single-player sudden death shootout if the entire competition ended in a tie.  When this came to pass in [[2003 Presidents Cup|2003]], the tiebreak was unfinished at dusk.  There was no provision for an extra day's play, and both team captains agreed to declare the match tied and share the trophy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.usatoday.com/sports/golf/2003-11-23-presidents-cup-day4_x.htm |title=Els-Woods playoff unable to settle Presidents Cup |last=Brennan |first=Christine |date=2003-11-25 |work=[[USA Today]] |accessdate=2009-01-29}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

Traditionally, professional [[stroke play]] golf tournaments ending in a tie were [[Playoff (golf)|played off]] the next day with an eighteen-hole match.  Modern considerations such as [[television]] coverage and the tight travel schedule of most leading golfers have led to this practice being almost entirely abandoned, and in all but the most important tournaments, the champion is determined by sudden death. All players tied after the completion of regulation play are taken to a predetermined hole, and then play it and others in order as needed. If at least two players are tied, player(s) who score higher on a hole than the other competitors is/are immediately eliminated, and those still tied continue play until one remaining player has a lower score for a hole than any of the others remaining, who is declared the winner.

Of the four men's [[Men's major golf championships|major championships]], only [[Masters Tournament|The Masters]] uses a sudden-death playoff format, first used in [[1979 Masters Tournament|1979]]. Through [[2017 U.S. Open (golf)|2017]] (and last used in [[2008 U.S. Open (golf)|2008]]), the {{nowrap|[[U.S. Open (golf)|U.S. Open]]}} had an 18-hole playoff at stroke play on the day after the main tournament, with sudden-death if needed after 18 holes. A two-hole aggregate playoff is used since [[2018 U.S. Open (golf)|2018]], followed by sudden-death if needed.&lt;ref name=abandn18&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.espn.com/golf/story/_/id/22586395/us-open-abandons-18-holes-2-hole-playoff |work=ESPN |agency=Associated Press |title=U.S. Open abandons 18 holes for 2-hole playoff |date=February 26, 2018 |accessdate=June 4, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; First used in [[1989 Open Championship|1989]], [[The Open Championship]] uses a four-hole total-stroke playoff, while the [[PGA Championship]] uses a three-hole total-stroke playoff, first used in [[2000 PGA Championship|2000]]. The PGA Championship introduced the sudden-death playoff to the majors in [[1977 PGA Championship|1977]]&lt;ref name=pgahist&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pga.com/pgachampionship/2012/history/championship_history.cfm |publisher=PGA of America|title=PGA Championship: history|accessdate=June 30, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and used it seven times through [[1996 PGA Championship|1996]]. Sudden death is used if a tie exists at the end of the scheduled playoff.

==Ice hockey==
Sudden-death overtime has traditionally been used in playoff and championship games in hockey. It has been used in the [[National Hockey League]] throughout the league's history. The first NHL game with sudden-death overtime was game four of the [[1919 Stanley Cup Finals]]. Currently, the NHL, [[American Hockey League]], and [[ECHL]] also use the sudden-death system in their regular seasons, playing a five-minute overtime period when the score is tied at the end of regulation time.

In 2000, the AHL reduced the teams to four players each during the five-minute overtime.  (But any two-man advantage is administered with five-on-three play rather than four-on-two.)  The ECHL and NHL both changed to the four-on-four overtime format in 2001, with the [[International Olympic Committee]] following by no later than 2010. By 2015 the NHL went to the three-on-three format.  In the [[Southern Professional Hockey League|SPHL]], a class A minor league, the overtime is three-on-three, with the team that would be on the power play given a fourth, and a fifth attacker respectively instead, and any penalty in the final two minutes results in a [[penalty shot]] instead of a power play.

If neither team scores during this period, the teams use a penalty-shot shootout, consisting of three players in the NHL or five players in the minor leagues, to determine the winner.  In the NHL, if no team wins this shootout, a 1-by-1, sudden-death shootout ensues. No player may shoot twice until every non-goaltender on the bench has taken a shot.

During championship playoffs, however, all games are played to a conclusion resulting in a victory for one team and a loss for the other.  These are true sudden-death games, which have gone on into as many as six additional full 20-minute periods with five players, instead of the five-minute period with at least three players.

IIHF hockey uses a penalty-shot shootout for gold medal games if neither team scores after one 20-minute, sudden-death overtime period. The shootout is decided in best-of-5 rounds, then round by round (in other words, if one team scores in the 6th round or beyond and the other fails, the game ends, unlike most professional leagues), and players can shoot as many times as the team desires (first 5 rounds are done in order, then reversely thereafter; may use new or same players). (There is a 5-minute overtime in round-robin games [10 minutes in elimination/bronze medal games], plus the best-of-5-round [best-of-3 rounds in round robin] shootout procedure in elimination/bronze medal games.)

==Judo==
In the case of a tie in competition [[judo]], the match proceeds to Golden Score, another form of Sudden Death. Sudden Death in competition Judo consists of a 5 minute long match, during which the first competitor to achieve a score is awarded the match. Penalties in Judo award points to the other competitor, making fair-play of absolute importance. If no victor is decided in Golden Score, the match is decided based on a Referee's Decision. A Referee's Decision is a vote amongst the Referee and both Judges of the match.

==Mixed martial arts==
In [[mixed martial arts]] competitions that consist of an even number of rounds, a type of sudden death is sometimes used in the event that each competitor wins an equal number of points. This is not a true sudden death that ends on the first point scored, since MMA competitions do not generally score individual points. Rather, it is a final round of combat, the winner of which is declared the winner of the match. This particular rule, known as "Sudden Victory", has been commonly seen in previous seasons of the [[reality television]] show ''[[The Ultimate Fighter]]'' when the competition has consisted of two rounds.  A sudden victory round rule was also implemented in the tournament to decide [[Ultimate Fighting Championship]]'s first Flyweight Champion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://sports.yahoo.com/blogs/mma-cagewriter/sudden-death-round-tap-ufc-flyweight-tournament-182515404.html |title=Sudden death round on tap for UFC’s flyweight tournament |first=Maggie |last=Handricks |publisher=Yahoo Sports |date=February 24, 2012 |accessdate=March 18, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Professional wrestling==
Sudden death in wrestling is most commonly seen in Real Canadian Wrestling tournament matches, in which a victor must be decided. This happens in the case of a double knockout or double countout. In the United States, Sudden Death rules occurs mainly in an [[Iron Man match]] when there is a tie after the time limit have expired. (Most notably at [[Wrestlemania XII]] when the match between [[Shawn Michaels]] and [[Bret Hart]] ended 0-0 after the 60 minute limit)

An example that invoked sudden death occurred in the [[Royal Rumble (2005)|2005 Royal Rumble]]. [[John Cena]] and [[Dave Batista|Batista]] were left, and both men's feet touched the ground at the same time. A comparable draw leading to sudden death might happen if the shoulders of a wrestler applying a submission move are on the mat.

==Rugby league==
{{further|List of National Rugby League golden point games}}
Drawn [[National Rugby League]] premiership and [[State of Origin series]] games are subject to sudden death extra time after 80 minutes of play, called the [[golden point]]. Golden point consists of two five-minute halves, with the teams swapping ends at the end of the first half.

Any score (try, penalty goal, or field goal) in golden point wins the game for the scoring team - no [[Try#Conversion|conversion]] is attempted if a try is the winning score.

In the NRL, the victor in golden point receives two competition points, the loser none.  In the event that no further scoring occurs, the game is drawn, and each team receives one point each.

==Rugby union==
In the knockout stages of rugby competitions, most notably the [[Rugby World Cup]], a match drawn after 80 minutes does not proceed immediately to sudden death conditions. Two 10-minute extra time periods are played first, if scores are level after 100 minutes then the rules call for a single sudden-death period of 10 minutes to be played.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Rugby World Cup|url = http://www.rugbyworldcup.com/tournament-rules|website = www.rugbyworldcup.com|access-date = 2016-02-09|last = rugbybworldcup.com|deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160201091833/http://www.rugbyworldcup.com/tournament-rules|archivedate = 2016-02-01|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; If the sudden-death extra time period results in no scoring a kicking competition is used to determine the winner.

However, no match in the history of the Rugby World Cup has ever gone past 100 minutes into a sudden-death extra time period.

==Tennis and volleyball==
In contrast with the usual sudden-death procedure of awarding the victory to the next side to score, [[tennis]] and [[volleyball]] require that the margin of victory be two.  A volleyball game tied at the target score continues until one team's score exceeds the other's by two points.

The traditional requirement that a tennis [[Tennis score|set]] be won by two games sometimes resulted in men's five-set matches lasting over six hours (including an [[Isner–Mahut match at the 2010 Wimbledon Championships|8-hour 11-minute set at Wimbledon]]) or, in women's/doubles' three-set matches, lasting over three hours, which is a major disruption to a television schedule.  To shorten matches, sets tied at six games each can now be broken by a single tiebreaker game.  This is awarded to the first player to score seven points.  The winner must lead the loser by two points, so tiebreaker games can become lengthy in their own right.

Tiebreakers are not used in major tournaments in the final set, except at the [[U.S. Open (tennis)|US Open]] &amp; the [[Tennis at the Summer Olympics|Olympics]].

'''Visual music''', sometimes called '''colour music''', refers to the use of musical structures in visual imagery, which can also include [[silent film]]s or silent [[Lumia (art)|Lumia]] work. It also refers to methods or devices which can translate sounds or music into a related visual presentation. An expanded definition may include the translation of music to painting; this was the original definition of the term, as coined by [[Roger Fry]] in 1912 to describe the work of [[Wassily Kandinsky]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/art/3653012/The-man-who-heard-his-paintbox-hiss.html|title=The man who heard his paintbox hiss|first=Ossian|last=Ward|date=9 June 2006|publisher=|via=www.telegraph.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are a variety of definitions of visual music, particularly as the field continues to expand. In some recent writing, usually in the [[fine art]] world, visual music is often confused with or defined as [[synaesthesia]], though historically this has never been a definition of visual music. Visual music has also been defined as a form of [[intermedia]].

Visual music also refers to systems which convert music or sound directly into visual forms, such as [[film]], [[video]], [[computer graphics]], installations or performances by means of a mechanical instrument, an artist's interpretation, or a computer. The reverse is applicable also, literally converting images to sound by drawn objects and figures on a film's soundtrack, in a technique known as drawn or [[graphical sound]]. Famous visual music artists include [[Jordan Belson]], [[Oskar Fischinger]], [[Norman McLaren]], [[John Whitney Sr.]], and [[Thomas Wilfred]], plus a number contemporary artists. 

==Instruments==

&lt;blockquote&gt;''Since ancient times artists have longed to create with moving lights a music for the eye comparable to the effects of sound for the ear.''&lt;br&gt;&amp;ndash; Dr. [[William Moritz]], the best-known historian of ''visual music'' writing in English, his speciality being the work of [[Oskar Fischinger]].&lt;ref name="CVMWM"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.centerforvisualmusic.org/TAVM.htm|title=Towards an Aesthetics of Visual Music|last=Moritz|first=William|year=1986|publisher=ASIFA Canada Bulletin,|accessdate=15 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

Sometimes also called "'''color music'''", the history of this tradition includes many experiments with [[color organ]]s. Artist or inventors "built instruments, usually called 'color organs,' that would display modulated colored light in some kind of fluid fashion comparable to music".&lt;ref&gt;Moritz, W, (1997), [http://www.awn.com/mag/issue2.1/articles/moritz2.1.html The Dream of Color Music, And Machines That Made it Possible] in  Animation World Magazine&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the ''Farblichtspiele'' ('coloured-light-plays') of former [[Bauhaus]] student [[Ludwig Hirschfeld Mack]]. Several different definitions of color music exist; one is that color music is generally formless projections of colored light. Some scholars and writers have used the term color music interchangeably with visual music.

The construction of instruments to perform visual music live, as with sonic music, has been a continuous concern of this art. Color organs, while related, form an earlier tradition extending as early as the eighteenth century with the Jesuit [[Louis Bertrand Castel]] building an ''ocular harpsichord'' in the 1730s (visited by [[Georg Philipp Telemann]], who composed for it). Other prominent color organ artist-inventors include: [[Alexander Wallace Rimington]], [[Bainbridge Bishop]], [[Thomas Wilfred]], [[Charles Dockum]], [[Mary Hallock-Greenewalt]] and [[Kurt Laurenz Theinert]].{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}

==On film==
Visual music and abstract film or video often coincide. Some of the earliest known films of these two genres were hand-painted works produced by the Futurists [[Bruno Corra]]&lt;ref&gt;{{IMdB name|id=0180651|title=Bruno Corra}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Arnaldo Ginna]] between 1911 and 1912 (as they report in the [[futurism (art)|Futurist Manifesto of Cinema]]), which are now lost. [[Mary Hallock-Greenewalt]] produced several reels of [[Direct Films|hand-painted films]] (although not traditional [[film|motion pictures]]) that are held by the Historical Society of Philadelphia. Like the Futurist films, and many other visual music films, her 'films' were meant to be a visualization of [[musical form]].

Notable visual music filmmakers include: [[Walter Ruttmann]], [[Hans Richter (artist)|Hans Richter]], [[Viking Eggeling]], [[Oskar Fischinger]], [[Len Lye]], [[Jordan Belson]], [[Norman McLaren]], [http://www.centerforvisualmusic.org/Bute.htm Mary Ellen Bute] (who made a series of films she called Seeing Sound films), [[Harry Everett Smith|Harry Smith]], [[Hy Hirsh]], [[John Whitney (animator)|John]] and [[James Whitney (filmmaker)|James Whitney]], [[Steven Woloshen]] and many others up to present day.

In 2005, a US exhibition called "Visual Music" at the [[Los Angeles Museum of Contemporary Art]] and The [[Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden]] in Washington DC included documentation of color organs and featured many visual music films&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.centerforvisualmusic.org/VMFilms.htm|title=VMfilms|author=|date=|website=www.centerforvisualmusic.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; and videos as well as paintings and some color organs.

The [[Center for Visual Music]] [http://www.centerforvisualmusic.org] in Los Angeles has the world's largest collection of visual music resources. CVM owns the papers, films and much animation artwork of Oskar Fischinger; the original research collection of visual music historian Dr. William Moritz; numerous restored films by Jordan Belson; and an extensive collection of restored films by Mary Ellen Bute, John and James Whitney, Jules Engel, Charles Dockum and others. CVM consulted for and provided films, stills and research for the above-mentioned blockbuster Visual Music exhibition; CVM now provides visual music films, programs, events and talks to museums, archives, festivals and cultural centres worldwide, in addition to curating and developing its own museum exhibitions (recently, Oskar Fischinger: Experiments in Cinematic Abstraction, in Amsterdam). The Fischinger three-projector reconstruction, Raumlichtkunst, was restored and curated by CVM, and has been exhibited at the Whitney Museum NY, Tate Modern London, Len Lye Centre New Zealand, and other museums and galleries worldwide. CVM recently released the second [http://www.centerforvisualmusic.org/Fischinger/newdvd.htm Oskar Fischinger DVD], as well as a compilation Visual Music from CVM Archive DVD with films by Jordan Belson, Bute, Dockum, Engel and Barry Spinello.  A summer 2018 CVM Visual Music symposium in California is being organized.

Artist  [[Larry Cuba]], founded the iota Fund in 1994, which was later called iotaCenter. They currently own the films of such artists as [[Sara Petty]], [[Adam Beckett]], some of the films of [[Jules Engel]], [[Sky David]], [[Robert Darroll]] and others. They hosted the renowned Kinetica programs (1999–2003) touring the world introducing new audiences to the wonders of visual music.

==Computer graphics==

[[Image:Oscilloscope diagram.png|thumb|right|Oscilloscope showing a single pitch, a [[sine wave]]]] The [[cathode ray tube]] made possible the [[oscilloscope]], an early electronic device that can produce images that are easily associated with sounds from microphones. The modern [[Laser lighting display]] displays wave patterns produced by similar circuitry. The imagery used to represent audio in [[digital audio workstation]]s is largely based on familiar oscilloscope patterns.
 
The [[Animusic]] company (originally called 'Visual Music') has repeatedly demonstrated the use of computers to convert music &amp;mdash;  principally pop-rock based and composed as [[MIDI]] events &amp;mdash; to animations. Graphic artist-designed [[virtual instrumentation|virtual instruments]] which either play themselves or are played by virtual objects are all, along with the sounds, controlled by MIDI instructions.&lt;ref name="ralberts"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://digitalmedia.oreilly.com/2006/03/22/animusic-computer-music-videos.html|title=Inside Animusic's Astonishing Computer Music Videos|last=Alberts|first=Randy|date=March 22, 2006|publisher=O'Reilly Media, Inc|accessdate=15 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the image-to-sound sphere, [[MetaSynth]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uisoftware.com/MetaSynth/index.php|title=MetaSynth 5 for Mac OS|author=|date=|website=www.uisoftware.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; includes a feature which converts images to sounds. The tool uses drawn or imported bitmap images, which can be manipulated with graphic tools, to generate new sounds or process existing audio. A reverse function allows the creation of images from sounds.&lt;ref name="sasso1005"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://emusician.com/mag/emusic_ui_softwaremetasynth_mac/|title=U&amp;I SOFTWARE MetaSynth 4 (Mac)|last=Sasso|first=Len|date=Oct 1, 2005|publisher=Electronic Musician|accessdate=15 June 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100301051808/http://emusician.com/mag/emusic_ui_softwaremetasynth_mac/|archive-date=1 March 2010|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some media player software generates animated imagery or [[music visualization]] based on a piece of recorded music:
*autom@ted_VisualMusiC_ 4.0 planned and realized by [[Sergio Maltagliati]]. This program can be configured to create random multiple visual-music variations, starting from a simple sonorous/visual cell. It generates a new and original audio-visual composition each time play is clicked.

==Virtual reality==
With the increasing popularity of [[Head-mounted display|head mounted displays]] for virtual reality &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wearabletechworld.com/topics/wearable-tech/articles/416177-tractica-expect-big-sales-vr-head-mounted-displays.htm|title=Tractica: Expect Big Sales of VR Head-Mounted Displays|author=|date=|website=www.wearabletechworld.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.statista.com/statistics/458037/virtual-reality-headsets-unit-sales-worldwide/|title=Global VR headset sales by brand 2016-2017 - Statistic|author=|date=|website=Statista}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.studiodaily.com/2017/01/how-big-is-the-installed-base-for-virtual-reality/|title=How Big Is the Installed Base for Virtual Reality? - Studio Daily|author=|date=11 January 2017|website=studiodaily.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; there is an emerging new platform for visual music. While some developers have been focused on the impact of [[virtual reality]] on live music &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/mach/innovation/how-virtual-reality-redefining-live-music-n687786|title=How virtual reality is redefining live music|author=|date=|website=nbcnews.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; or on the possibilities for [[music video]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/aug/04/virtual-insanity-vr-new-frontier-music-videos-waves|title=Virtual insanity: is VR the new frontier for music videos?|first=Brian|last=Moylan|date=4 August 2016|website=the Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; virtual reality is also an emerging field for [[music visualization]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://gizmodo.com/vr-music-visualizers-are-like-tripping-without-drugs-1712457576|title=VR Music Visualizers Are Like Tripping Without Drugs|first=Chris|last=Mills|date=|website=gizmodo.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theverge.com/2015/12/28/10675270/gear-vr-virtual-reality-music-visualizer-groovr|title=Does anybody really want a virtual reality music visualizer?|author=|date=|website=theverge.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://groovr.com/|title=GrooVR Music Driven Virtual Reality - Music Visualizer|author=|date=|website=groovr.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.us.playstation.com/2015/06/17/harmonix-music-vr-coming-to-project-morpheus/|title=PlayStation.Blog|author=|date=|website=PlayStation.Blog}}&lt;/ref&gt; and visual music.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/arts/music/2013/04/01/inventor-updates-creation-bring-vision-music/4KRSQ8c35h4ejqSU2Zk4EO/story.html|title=Inventor updates ’70s creation to bring 3-D vision to music - The Boston Globe|author=|date=|website=bostonglobe.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Graphic notation==
Many composers have applied [[graphic notation (music)|graphic notation]] to write compositions. Pioneering examples are the graphical scores of [[John Cage]] and [[Morton Feldman]]. Also known is the graphical score of [[György Ligeti]]s [[Artikulation (Ligeti)|Artikulation]] designed by Rainer Wehinger.

Musical theorists such as [[Harry Partch]], [[Erv Wilson]], [[Ivor Darreg]], [[Glenn Branca]], and [[Yuri Landman]] applied [[geometry]] in detailed visual musical diagrams explaining [[microtonal]] structures and [[musical scale]]s.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19883">In [[decision theory]], the '''von Neumann-Morgenstern utility theorem''' shows that, under certain [[axiom]]s of [[rationality|rational behavior]], a decision-maker faced with [[risk]]y (probabilistic) outcomes of different choices will behave as if he or she is maximizing the [[expected value]] of some function defined over the potential outcomes at some specified point in the future. This function is known as the von Neumann-Morgenstern utility function. The theorem is the basis for [[expected utility theory]].

In 1947, [[John von Neumann]] and [[Oskar Morgenstern]] proved that any individual whose [[preference (economics)|preferences]] satisfied four axioms has a [[utility function]];&lt;ref name="VNM"&gt;[[John von Neumann|Neumann, John von]] and [[Oskar Morgenstern|Morgenstern, Oskar]], ''[[Theory of Games and Economic Behavior]]''. Princeton, NJ. Princeton University Press, 1953.&lt;/ref&gt; such an individual's preferences can be represented on an [[interval scale]] and the individual will always prefer actions that maximize expected utility. That is, they proved that an agent is (VNM-)rational ''if and only if'' there exists a real-valued function ''u'' defined by possible outcomes such that every preference of the agent is characterized by maximizing the expected value of ''u'', which can then be defined as the agent's ''VNM-utility'' (it is unique up to adding a constant and multiplying by a positive scalar). No claim is made that the agent has a "conscious desire" to maximize ''u'', only that ''u'' exists.

Any individual whose preferences violate von Neumann and Morgenstern's axioms would agree to a [[Dutch book]], which is a set of bets that necessarily leads to a loss. Therefore, it is arguable that any individual who violates the axioms is irrational.  The [[expected utility hypothesis]] is that rationality can be modeled as maximizing an [[expected value]], which given the theorem, can be summarized as "''rationality is VNM-rationality''".

VNM-utility is a ''decision utility'' in that it is used to describe ''decision preferences''. It is related but not equivalent to so-called ''E-utilities''&lt;ref name="KWS"&gt;Kahneman, Wakker and Sarin, 1997, ''Back to Bentham? Explorations of experienced utility'', The quarterly journal of economics.&lt;/ref&gt; (experience utilities), notions of utility intended to measure happiness such as that of [[Jeremy Bentham|Bentham]]'s [[Greatest happiness principle|Greatest Happiness Principle]].

== Set-up ==
In the theorem, an individual agent is faced with options called ''lotteries''. Given some [[mutually exclusive]] outcomes, a lottery is a scenario where each outcome will happen with a given [[probability]], all probabilities summing to one. For example, for two outcomes ''A'' and ''B'',

::&lt;math&gt;L = 0.25A + 0.75B &lt;/math&gt;

denotes a scenario where ''P''(''A'')&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;25% is the probability of ''A'' occurring and ''P''(''B'')&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;75% (and exactly one of them will occur).  More generally, for a lottery with many possible outcomes ''A&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'', we write

::&lt;math&gt;
L = \sum p_i A_i,
&lt;/math&gt;

with the sum of the &lt;math&gt;p_i&lt;/math&gt;s equalling 1.

The outcomes in a lottery can themselves be lotteries between other outcomes, and the expanded expression is considered an equivalent lottery: 0.5(0.5''A''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;0.5''B'')&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;0.5''C'' =&amp;nbsp;0.25''A''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;0.25''B''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;0.50''C''.

If lottery ''M'' is preferred over lottery ''L'', we write &lt;math&gt;L \prec M&lt;/math&gt;, or equivalently, &lt;math&gt;M \succ L&lt;/math&gt;.  If the agent is indifferent between ''L'' and&amp;nbsp;''M'', we write the ''indifference relation''&lt;ref name="Kreps"&gt;[[David M. Kreps|Kreps, David M.]] ''Notes on the Theory of Choice''. Westview Press (May 12, 1988), chapters 2 and 5.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;math&gt;L\sim M.&lt;/math&gt; If ''M'' is either preferred over or viewed with indifference relative to ''L'', we write &lt;math&gt;L \preceq M.&lt;/math&gt;

== The axioms ==
The four axioms of VNM-rationality are then ''completeness'', ''transitivity'', ''continuity'', and ''independence''.

Completeness assumes that an individual has well defined preferences:

:'''Axiom 1 (Completeness)''' For any lotteries ''L,M'', exactly one of the following holds:

::&lt;math&gt;\, L\prec M&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\, M\prec L&lt;/math&gt;, or &lt;math&gt;\, L \sim M  &lt;/math&gt;

(either ''M'' is preferred, ''L'' is preferred, or the individual is indifferent&lt;ref name="nop"&gt;Implicit in denoting indifference by equality are assertions like if &lt;math&gt;L\prec M = N&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt;L\prec N&lt;/math&gt;.  To make such relations explicit in the axioms, Kreps (1988) chapter 2 denotes indifference by &lt;math&gt;\,\sim&lt;/math&gt;, so it may be surveyed in brief for intuitive meaning.&lt;/ref&gt;).

[[Transitive relation|Transitivity]] assumes that preferences are consistent across any three options:

:'''Axiom 2 (Transitivity)''' If &lt;math&gt;\,L \prec M&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\,M \prec N&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;\,L \prec N&lt;/math&gt;, and similarly for &lt;math&gt;\sim&lt;/math&gt;.

Continuity assumes that there is a "tipping point" between being ''better than'' and ''worse than'' a given middle option:

:'''Axiom 3 (Continuity):''' If &lt;math&gt;\,L \preceq M\preceq N&lt;/math&gt;, then there exists a probability &lt;math&gt;\,p\in[0,1]&lt;/math&gt; such that
::&lt;math&gt;\,pL + (1-p)N\, \sim \,M&lt;/math&gt;

where the notation on the left side refers to a situation in which ''L'' is received with probability ''p'' and ''N'' is received with probability (1–''p'').

Instead of continuity, an alternative axiom can be assumed that does not involve a precise equality, called the [[Archimedean property]].&lt;ref name="Kreps" /&gt;  It says that any separation in preference can be maintained under a sufficiently small deviation in probabilities:

:'''Axiom 3′ (Archimedean property):''' If &lt;math&gt;\,L \prec M\prec N&lt;/math&gt;, then there exists a probability &lt;math&gt;\,\varepsilon\in(0,1)&lt;/math&gt; such that

::&lt;math&gt;\,(1-\varepsilon)L + \varepsilon N\, \prec \,M \, \prec \,\varepsilon L + (1-\varepsilon)N.&lt;/math&gt;

Only one of (3) and (3′) need be assumed, and the other will be implied by the theorem.

[[Independence of irrelevant alternatives]] assumes that a preference holds independently of the possibility of another outcome:

:'''Axiom 4 (Independence):''' If &lt;math&gt;\,L\preceq M&lt;/math&gt;, then for any &lt;math&gt;\,N&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\,p\in[0,1]&lt;/math&gt;,
::&lt;math&gt;\,pL+(1-p)N \preceq pM+(1-p)N.&lt;/math&gt;

The independence axiom implies the axiom on reduction of compound lotteries:&lt;ref&gt;EconPort, "Von Neumann-Morgenstern Expected Utility Theory" http://www.econport.org/content/handbook/decisions-uncertainty/basic/von.html&lt;/ref&gt;

:'''Axiom 4′ (Reduction of compound lotteries):''' For any lotteries &lt;math&gt;L, L', N&lt;/math&gt; any &lt;math&gt;p, q \in [0,1]&lt;/math&gt;, 

:: &lt;math&gt;if \qquad L\sim qL'+(1-q)N,&lt;/math&gt;
:: &lt;math&gt;then \quad pL+(1-p)N \sim pqL'+(1-pq)N.&lt;/math&gt;

To see how Axiom 4 implies Axiom 4', set &lt;math&gt;M = qL'+(1-q)N&lt;/math&gt; in the expression in Axiom 4, and expand.

== The theorem ==
For any VNM-rational agent (i.e. satisfying axioms 1–4), there exists a function ''u'' which assigns to each outcome ''A'' a real number ''u(A)'' such that for any two lotteries,

::&lt;math&gt;L\prec M \qquad \mathrm{if \, and \, only \, if} \qquad E(u(L)) &lt; E(u(M)), &lt;/math&gt;

where ''E(u(L))'', or more briefly ''Eu''(''L'') is given by

::&lt;math&gt;Eu(p_1A_1 + \ldots + p_nA_n) = p_1u(A_1) + \cdots + p_nu(A_n). &lt;/math&gt;

As such, ''u'' can be uniquely determined (up to adding a constant and multiplying by a positive scalar) by preferences between ''simple lotteries'', meaning those of the form ''pA''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;(1&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;''p'')''B'' having only two outcomes.  Conversely, any agent acting to maximize the expectation of a function ''u'' will obey axioms 1–4.  Such a function is called the agent's '''von Neumann–Morgenstern (VNM) utility'''.

=== Proof sketch ===
&lt;div id='construction'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
The proof is constructive: it shows how the desired function &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt; can be built. Here we outline the construction process for the case in which the number of sure outcomes is finite.&lt;ref name=KeeneyRaiffa1993&gt;{{Cite book

&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|132–134}}

Suppose there are ''n'' sure outcomes, &lt;math&gt;A_1\dots A_n&lt;/math&gt;. Note that every sure outcome can be seen as a lottery: it is a degenerate lottery in which the outcome is selected with probability 1. Hence, by the Completeness axiom, it is possible to order the outcomes from worst to best:
:&lt;math&gt;A_1\preceq A_2\preceq \cdots \preceq A_n&lt;/math&gt;

We assume that at least one of the inequalities is strict (otherwise the utility function is trivial—a constant). So &lt;math&gt;A_1\prec A_n&lt;/math&gt;. We use these two extreme outcomes—the worst and the best—as the scaling unit of our utility function, and define:

:&lt;math&gt;u(A_1)=0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;u(A_n)=1&lt;/math&gt;

For every probability &lt;math&gt;p\in[0,1]&lt;/math&gt;, define a lottery that selects the best outcome with probability &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; and the worst outcome otherwise:
:&lt;math&gt;L(p) = p\cdot A_n + (1-p)\cdot A_1&lt;/math&gt;
Note that &lt;math&gt;L(0)\sim A_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;L(1)\sim A_n&lt;/math&gt;.

By the Continuity axiom, for every sure outcome &lt;math&gt;A_i&lt;/math&gt;, there is a probability &lt;math&gt;q_i&lt;/math&gt; such that:
:&lt;math&gt;L(q_i) \sim A_i&lt;/math&gt;

and
:&lt;math&gt;0 = q_1\leq q_2\leq \cdots \leq q_n = 1&lt;/math&gt;

For every &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;, the utility function for outcome &lt;math&gt;A_i&lt;/math&gt; is defined as
:&lt;math&gt;u(A_i)=q_i&lt;/math&gt;

so the utility of every lottery &lt;math&gt;M=\sum_i{p_i A_i}&lt;/math&gt; is the expectation of ''u'':
:&lt;math&gt;u(M) = u(\sum_i{p_i A_i}) = \sum_i{p_i u(A_i)} = \sum_i{p_i q_i}&lt;/math&gt;

To see why this utility function make sense, consider a lottery &lt;math&gt;M = \sum_i{p_i A_i}&lt;/math&gt;, which selects outcome &lt;math&gt;A_i&lt;/math&gt; with probability &lt;math&gt;p_i&lt;/math&gt;. But, by our assumption, the decision maker is indifferent between the sure outcome &lt;math&gt;A_i&lt;/math&gt; and the lottery &lt;math&gt;q_i\cdot A_n + (1-q_i)\cdot A_1&lt;/math&gt;. So, by the Reduction axiom, he is indifferent between the lottery &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; and the following lottery:
:&lt;math&gt;M' = \sum_i{p_i [q_i\cdot A_n + (1-q_i)\cdot A_1]}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;M' = (\sum_i{p_i q_i})\cdot A_n + (\sum_i{p_i(1-q_i)})\cdot A_1&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;M' = u(M)\cdot A_n + (1-u(M))\cdot A_1&lt;/math&gt;
The lottery &lt;math&gt;M'&lt;/math&gt; is, in effect, a lottery in which the best outcome is won with probability &lt;math&gt;u(M)&lt;/math&gt;, and the worst outcome otherwise.

Hence, if &lt;math&gt;u(M)&gt;u(L)&lt;/math&gt;, a rational decision maker would prefer the lottery &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; over the lottery &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt;, because it gives him a larger chance to win the best outcome.

Hence:
::&lt;math&gt;L\prec M \; &lt;/math&gt; if and only if &lt;math&gt; E(u(L)) &lt; E(u(M)).&lt;/math&gt;

=== Reaction ===
Von Neumann and Morgenstern anticipated surprise at the strength of their conclusion.  But according to them, the reason their utility function works is that it is constructed precisely to fill the role of something whose expectation is maximized:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"Many economists will feel that we are assuming far too much ... Have we not shown too much? ... As far as we can see, our postulates [are] plausible ... We have practically defined numerical utility as being that thing for which the calculus of mathematical expectations is legitimate."&amp;nbsp;– ''VNM 1953, §&amp;nbsp;3.1.1 p.16 and §&amp;nbsp;3.7.1 p. 28''&lt;ref name="VNM" /&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Thus, the content of the theorem is that the construction of ''u'' is possible, and they claim little about its nature.

== Consequences ==

=== Automatic consideration of risk aversion ===
{{Main|Risk aversion}}

It is often the case that a person, faced with real-world [[gamble]]s with money, does not act to maximize the expected value of their ''dollar assets.''  For example, a person who only possesses $1000 in savings may be reluctant to risk it all for a 20% chance odds to win $10,000, even though

:&lt;math&gt;20\%(\$10\,000)+80\%(\$0) = \$2000 &gt; 100\%(\$1000)&lt;/math&gt;

However, ''if'' the person is VNM-rational, such facts are automatically accounted for in their utility function ''u''.  In this example, we could conclude that

:&lt;math&gt;20\%u(\$10\,000)+80\%u(\$0) &lt; u(\$1000)&lt;/math&gt;

where the dollar amounts here really represent ''outcomes'' (cf. "''[[Value theory|value]]''"), the three possible situations the individual could face.  In particular, ''u'' can exhibit properties like ''u''($1)+''u''($1) ≠ ''u''($2) without contradicting VNM-rationality at all.  This leads to a quantitative theory of [[risk aversion#Absolute risk aversion|monetary risk aversion.]]

=== Implications for the expected utility hypothesis ===
{{Main|Expected utility hypothesis}}

In 1738, [[Daniel Bernoulli]] published a treatise&lt;ref&gt;''Specimen theoriae novae de mensura sortis'' or ''Exposition of a New Theory on the Measurement of Risk''&lt;/ref&gt; in which he posits that rational behavior can be described as maximizing the expectation of a function ''u'', which in particular need not be monetary-valued, thus accounting for risk aversion.  This is the ''expected utility hypothesis''.  As stated, the hypothesis may appear to be a bold claim.  The aim of the ''expected utility theorem'' is to provide "modest conditions" (i.e. axioms) describing when the expected utility hypothesis holds, which can be evaluated directly and intuitively:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"The axioms should not be too numerous, their system is to be as simple and transparent as possible, and each axiom should have an immediate intuitive meaning by which its appropriateness may be judged directly.  In a situation like ours this last requirement is particularly vital, in spite of its vagueness: we want to make an intuitive concept amenable to mathematical treatment and to see as clearly as
possible what hypotheses this requires."&amp;nbsp;– ''VNM 1953 §&amp;nbsp;3.5.2, p. 25''&lt;ref name="VNM" /&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

As such, claims that the expected utility hypothesis does not characterize rationality must reject one of the VNM axioms.  A variety of [[generalized expected utility]] theories have arisen, most of which drop or relax the independence axiom.

=== Implications for ethics and moral philosophy ===
{{Main|Consequentialism}}

Because the theorem assumes nothing about the nature of the possible outcomes of the gambles, they could be morally significant events, for instance involving the life, death, sickness, or health of others.  A von Neumann–Morgenstern rational agent is capable of acting with great concern for such events, sacrificing much personal wealth or well-being, and all of these actions will factor into the construction/definition of the agent's VNM-utility function.  In other words, both what is naturally perceived as "personal gain", and what is naturally perceived as "altruism", are implicitly balanced in the VNM-utility function of a VNM-rational individual.  Therefore, the full range of [[Consequentialism#Agent-focused or agent-neutral|agent-focussed to agent-neutral]] behaviors are {{clarify|text=possible with various VNM-utility functions|date=March 2016}}.

If the utility of &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;pM&lt;/math&gt;, a von Neumann–Morgenstern rational agent must be indifferent between &lt;math&gt;1N&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;pM+(1-p)0&lt;/math&gt;. An agent-focused von Neumann–Morgenstern rational agent therefore cannot favor more equal, or "fair", distributions of utility between its own possible future selves.

=== Distinctness from other notions of utility ===
Some [[Utilitarianism#Average v total|utilitarian moral theories]] are concerned with quantities called the "total utility" and "average utility" of collectives, and characterize morality in terms of favoring the utility or happiness of others with disregard for one's own.  These notions can be related to, but are distinct from, VNM-utility:
* 1) VNM-utility is a ''decision utility'':&lt;ref name="KWS" /&gt; it is that according to which one decides, and thus by definition cannot be something which one disregards.
* 2) VNM-utility is not canonically additive across multiple individuals (see Limitations), so "total VNM-utility" and "average VNM-utility" are not immediately meaningful (some sort of normalization assumption is required).

The term ''E-utility'' for "experience utility" has been coined&lt;ref name="KWS" /&gt; to refer to the types of "hedonistic" utility like that of [[Jeremy Bentham|Bentham]]'s [[greatest happiness principle]].  Since morality affects decisions, a VNM-rational agent's morals will affect the definition of its own utility function (see above).  Thus, the morality of a VNM-rational agent can be characterized by ''correlation'' of the agent's VNM-utility with the VNM-utility, E-utility, or "happiness" of others, among other means, but not by ''disregard'' for the agent's own VNM-utility, a contradiction in terms.

== Limitations ==

=== Nested gambling ===
Since if ''L'' and ''M'' are lotteries, then ''pL''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;(1&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;''p'')''M'' is simply "expanded out" and considered a lottery itself, the VNM formalism ignores what may be experienced as "nested gambling".  This is related to the [[Ellsberg paradox|Ellsberg problem]] where people choose to avoid the perception of ''risks about risks''.  Von Neumann and Morgenstern recognized this limitation:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"...concepts like a ''specific utility of gambling'' cannot be formulated free of contradiction on this level.  This may seem to be a paradoxical assertion.  But anybody who has seriously tried to axiomatize that elusive concept, will probably concur with it."&amp;nbsp;– ''VNM 1953 §&amp;nbsp;3.7.1, p. 28''.&lt;ref name="VNM" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Incomparability between agents ===
Since for any two VNM-agents ''X'' and ''Y'', their VNM-utility functions ''u&lt;sub&gt;X&lt;/sub&gt;'' and ''u&lt;sub&gt;Y&lt;/sub&gt;'' are only determined up to additive constants and multiplicative positive scalars, the theorem does not provide any canonical way to compare the two.  Hence expressions like ''u&lt;sub&gt;X&lt;/sub&gt;''(''L'') + ''u&lt;sub&gt;Y&lt;/sub&gt;''(''L'') and ''u&lt;sub&gt;X&lt;/sub&gt;''(''L'')&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;''u&lt;sub&gt;Y&lt;/sub&gt;''(''L'') are not canonically defined, nor are comparisons like ''u&lt;sub&gt;X&lt;/sub&gt;''(''L'')&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;''u&lt;sub&gt;Y&lt;/sub&gt;''(''L'') canonically true or false.  In particular, the aforementioned "total VNM-utility" and "average VNM-utility" of a population are not canonically meaningful without normalization assumptions.

=== Applicability to economics ===
The [[expected utility hypothesis]], as applied to economics, has limited predictive accuracy, simply because in practice, humans do not always behave VNM-rationally. This is manifested in several experimental outcomes such as the [[Allais paradox]].
This can be interpreted as evidence that
* humans are not always rational, or
* VNM-rationality is not an appropriate characterization of rationality, or
* some combination of both, or
* humans ''do'' behave VNM-rationally but the objective evaluation of ''u'' and the construction of ''u'' are [[Intractability (complexity)|intractable]] problems.

==History==
Founded in 1923 by men and women who had [[opposed World War I]], it is a section of the London-based [[War Resisters' International]].&lt;ref name="S2012"&gt;{{cite book|author=Roger Powers S|title=Protest, Power, and Change: An Encyclopedia of Nonviolent Action|year= 2012|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-136-76482-0 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=xmlWr4aAt4EC&amp;pg=PA563 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It continues to be one of the leading radical voices in the anti-war movement.&lt;ref name="forusa.org"/&gt;

Many of the organization's founders had been jailed during [[World War I]] for refusing [[conscription in the United States|military service]].  From the [[Fellowship of Reconciliation]] many [[Jew]]s, [[suffragist]]s, [[socialist]]s, and [[anarchists]] separated to form this more [[secular]] organization.

Although the WRL was opposed to US participation in [[World War II]], it did not protest against it; the WRL complied with the [[Espionage Act of 1917|Espionage Act]], ceased public protests, and did not solicit new members during this period.&lt;ref&gt;Bennett, p. 74.&lt;/ref&gt; During [[World War II]], many members were imprisoned as conscientious objectors.&lt;ref&gt;Bennett, p. 69ff&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1950s, WRL members worked in the [[civil rights movement]] and organized protests against [[nuclear weapon]]s testing and [[United States civil defense|civil defense]] drills.&lt;ref name="history"/&gt;

In the 1960s, WRL was the first [[pacifist]] organization to call for an end to the [[Vietnam War]].&lt;ref name="history"/&gt; WRL also organized the first demonstration against the war with a September 21, 1963 vigil at the U.S. Mission to the UN, followed by an October 9, 1963 picket of [[Madame Ngo Dinh Nhu]] speaking at the [[Waldorf-Astoria in New York City]].&lt;ref&gt;''WRL News'', Nov-Dec 1963, p. 1&lt;/ref&gt; WRL was among the primary groups (along with [[Committee for Nonviolent Action]], the [[Fellowship of Reconciliation]], the [[Socialist Party]], and the [[Student Peace Union]]) to organize coordinated nationwide protests against the Vietnam War on December 19, 1964.&lt;ref&gt;''The Power of the People'', ed. Robert Cooney &amp; Helen Michalowski, [[New Society Publishers]], Philadelphia, PA, 1987, p. 182&lt;/ref&gt;

The organization's opposition to nuclear weapons was extended to include [[nuclear power]] in the 1970s and 1980s. The WRL has also been active in [[feminism|feminist]] and anti-[[racism|racist]] causes and works with other organizations to reduce the level of violence in modern culture.

==Current activities==
Presently, the War Resisters League is actively organizing against the wars in [[Iraq]] and [[Afghanistan]] as well as the impact of war at home.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Barry |first=Dan |title=A nation at war: at war at home; as wars come and go, Ralph keeps protesting |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=990CE6D91F31F931A15750C0A9659C8B63&amp;&amp;scp=9&amp;sq=%22War%20Resisters%20League%22&amp;st=cse |journal=New York Times |year=2003 |issue=March 22 |accessdate=2008-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Much of its organizing is focused on challenging military recruiters and ending corporate profit from war. It publishes an annual peace calendar, the quarterly magazine ''WIN: Through Revolutionary Nonviolence'', and other materials and is involved in a number of national peace and justice coalitions, including [[United for Peace and Justice]] and the [[National War Tax Resistance Coordinating Committee]]. Since 1958, WRL has awarded almost annually the [[War Resisters League Peace Award]] to a person or organization whose work represents the League's radical nonviolent program of action.

The War Resisters League annually publishes a pie chart showing how much of the [[US Budget|U.S. federal budget]] actually covers current and past [[Military budget of the United States|military expenses]], listing the total as 54%:
:"The figures are federal funds, which do not include trust funds — such as Social Security — that are raised and spent separately from income taxes....The government practice of [[Unified budget|combining trust and federal funds]] began during the [[Vietnam War]], thus making the human needs portion of the budget seem larger and the military portion smaller. "&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.warresisters.org/pages/piechart.htm Pie chart], warresisters.org.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.lewrockwell.com/sardi/sardi59.html|title=How Much Does It Cost Your Household for War?|last=Sardi|first=Bill |work=lewrockwell.com|accessdate=2009-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These figures are at odds with official government figures:  
:"[Dov S. Zakheim, the Pentagon comptroller pointed] out that the 2004 military budget would represent 16.6 percent of all federal spending, compared with 27.3 percent in the late 1980's."&lt;ref&gt;Wayne, Leslie.

(February 4, 2003).&lt;/ref&gt;

:"...War Resisters....count moneys appropriated for veterans' benefits and payment of the national debt as "taxes to support past wars." The group does this because the only way it can arrive at the figure of 47 percent of the federal budget going to the military is to count what they see as past military spending."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://frontpagemag.com/Articles/Read.aspx?GUID=B65F7E43-50D4-409D-9162-2BC1CEA92E94 |title=No Taxes for Freedom!|last=Jennings|first=Daniel G. |date=May 2, 2003 |publisher=FrontPageMagazine.com|accessdate=2009-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;
