'''Amnesty''' (from the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] ἀμνηστία ''amnestia'', "forgetfulness, passing over") is defined as: "A pardon extended by the government to a group or class of people, usually for a political offense; the act of a sovereign power officially forgiving certain classes of people who are subject to trial but have not yet been convicted."&lt;ref&gt;Bryan A. Gardner (ed.). 2009. Blacks Law Dictionary (9th ed.). St. Paul, MN: West, p99&lt;/ref&gt;
It includes more than [[pardon]], inasmuch as it obliterates all legal remembrance of the offense.&lt;ref name="EB1911"&gt;{{EB1911|inline=y|wstitle=Amnesty|volume=1|page=875}}&lt;/ref&gt; Amnesty is more and more used to express "freedom" and the time when prisoners can go free.

Amnesties, which in the [[United Kingdom]] may be granted by the crown or by an act of [[British Parliament|Parliament]], were formerly usual on coronations and similar occasions, but are chiefly exercised towards associations of political criminals, and are sometimes granted absolutely, though more frequently there are certain specified exceptions. Thus, in the case of the earliest recorded amnesty, that of [[Thrasybulus]] at [[Athens]], the thirty tyrants and a few others were expressly excluded from its operation; and the amnesty proclaimed on the restoration of [[Charles II of England]] did not extend to those who had taken part in the execution of his father. Other famous amnesties include: [[Napoleon]]'s amnesty of March 13, 1815 from which thirteen eminent persons, including [[Talleyrand]], were exempt; the [[Prussia]]n amnesty of August 10, 1840; the general amnesty proclaimed by the emperor [[Franz Josef I of Austria]] in 1857; the general amnesty granted by [[President of the United States]], [[Andrew Johnson]], after the [[American Civil War]] (1861–April 9, 1865), in 1868, and the French amnesty of 1905.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt; Amnesty in U.S. politics in 1872 meant restoring the right to vote and hold office to ex-Confederates, which was achieved by act of Congress.&lt;ref&gt;Robert W. Burg, "Amnesty, Civil Rights, and the Meaning of Liberal Republicanism, 1862-1872". ''American Nineteenth Century History'' 2003 4(3): 29-60.&lt;/ref&gt; Those were true amnesties, pardoning past violations without changing the laws violated.

The [[Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986]]—signed into law by President [[Ronald Reagan]] on November 6, 1986—granted amnesty to about 3 million undocumented immigrants in the United States.

==Purposes==
An amnesty may be extended when the authority decides that bringing citizens into compliance with a law is more important than punishing them for past offenses. Amnesty after a war helps end a conflict. While laws against treason, sedition, etc. are retained to discourage future traitors during future conflicts, it makes sense to forgive past offenders, after the enemy no longer exists which had attracted their support but a significant number remains in flight from authorities. Amnesty is often used to get people to turn in contraband, as in the case of China's gun restrictions,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/5151002.stm | work=BBC News | title=China sets gun amnesty deadline | date=July 5, 2006 | accessdate=April 23, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; or the Kansas City ban on pit bulls.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.ljworld.com/news/2006/aug/13/pit_bull_amnesty_convinces_some_owners_abide_ban/|title=Pit bull amnesty convinces some owners to abide by ban|work=LJWorld.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Advantages of using amnesty may include avoiding expensive prosecutions (especially when massive numbers of violators are involved); prompting violators to come forward who might otherwise have eluded authorities; and promoting reconciliation between offenders and society. An example of the latter was the amnesty that was granted to [[conscientious objector]]s and [[draft evasion|draft evader]]s in the wake of the [[Vietnam War]] in the 1970s, in an effort by President Carter to heal war wounds, given that both the war and the draft were over.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/asia/vietnam/vietnam_1-21-77.html|title=Online NewsHour: Remembering Vietnam: Carter's Pardon&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;|author=|date=|website=pbs.org|accessdate=19 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An example of an argument made for amnesty for undocumented immigrants is that they would be allowed to qualify for higher paying jobs, scholarships, and other services. According to the Center for Study of Immigration Integration, if California alone were to adopt an amnesty program, they would benefit by $16 billion (Pastor, 2010).&lt;ref&gt;Pastor, M. (2010, January 12). The Economic Benefits of Immigration Authorization In California. Retrieved October 8, 2010, from USC Center for Study of Immigrant Integration: http://csii.usc.edu/economic_benefits.html&lt;/ref&gt;

With amnesty, immigrants can seek out higher education. A RAND study found that, by the age of 30, a Mexican immigrant woman who becomes a legal resident can obtain a college degree. With a college degree she will pay $5,300 more in taxes and cost $3,900 less in government expenses each year compared to a high-school dropout with similar characteristics. Workers who lacked a high-school diploma in 2006 earned an average of only $419 per week and had an unemployment rate of 6.8 percent. In contrast, workers with a bachelor's degree earned $962 per week and had an unemployment rate of 2.3 percent, while those with a doctorate earned $1,441 and had an unemployment rate of only 1.4 percent (Gonzales, 2010).&lt;ref&gt;Gonzales, R. G. (2010). Getting A Return on Investment: The California DREAM Act. Retrieved November 1, 2010, from University of California, Berkeley Law School : {{cite web|url=http://www.law.berkeley.edu/3267.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-11-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110728073827/http://www.law.berkeley.edu/3267.htm |archivedate=2011-07-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy==
Amnesty can at times raise questions of justice. An example was the Ugandan government's offer not to prosecute alleged war criminal [[Joseph Kony]], in hopes that further bloodshed would be avoided.&lt;ref&gt;http://stinet.dtic.mil/cgi-bin/GetTRDoc?AD=ADA471234&amp;Location=U2&amp;doc=GetTRDoc.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; David Smock noted, "The downside of it is the impunity that it implies; that people can commit atrocities and say that they will only stop if they are given amnesty..."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/library/news/2006/08/mil-060801-voa20.htm|title=Amnesty Offer for Ugandan Rebel Kony Raises Controversy|author=John Pike|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A controversial issue in the United States is whether illegal immigrants should be granted some form of amnesty. It is proposed that illegal immigrants be able to come forward and immediately receive probationary status.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usimmigrationsupport.org/amnesty.html|title=Immigration Amnesty|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; California Republican Governor [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]] said an amnesty program similar to the one the federal government undertook in the late 1980s would be ill-advised today. It just didn't work. "It backfired big-time. It sent the wrong message: You come here illegally, and then we go and give you amnesty. So then, the next million come and they say, 'Hey, we get amnesty, this is really terrific'."&lt;ref&gt;Schwarzenegger, A. (n.d.). Retrieved October 31, 2010, from Government Press: http://gov.ca.gov/pdf/press/2007bills/SB%201%20Veto%20Message.pdf{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some allege that at the national level an amnesty program would cost $2.6 trillion.&lt;ref&gt;Rector, R. (2007, June 6). Amnesty Will Cost U.S. Taxpayers at Least $2.6 Trillion . Retrieved 11 November 2010, from The Heritage Foundation : http://www.heritage.org/Research/Reports/2007/06/Amnesty-Will-Cost-US-Taxpayers-at-Least-26-Trillion&lt;/ref&gt; This would only include the costs for the first year. The Federal Government would need to hire additional workers to help register immigrants, increasing costs for labor and or facilities. It is also alleged that an amnesty program would draw far more immigrants into the U.S. to receive amnesty, so the costs would continue to increase.

Some allege that due to the large number of illegal immigrants residing in the U.S., the government had to hire outside contractors. This led to mass cases of fraudulent activity. Illegal immigrants were paying off workers to falsify information, grant amnesty for family and or friends, and providing other relevant services. {{Citation needed|reason=This is a significant claim and requires a source.|date=March 2017}}

Controversies also raise towards amnesties given to alleged perpetrators of the most serious crimes of international law (or crimes of the [[Peremptory norm|''Jus Cogens'']] which include genocide, crimes against humanity, war crimes, and aggression&lt;ref&gt;M. Cherif Bassiouni. 1998. International Crimes: Jus Cogens and Obligatio Erga Omnes, Law &amp; Contemporary Problems, 59: 63-74&lt;/ref&gt;). Courts have rejected amnesties for such crimes, such as the [[International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia]]&lt;ref&gt;Prosecutor v. Furundžija, Trial Chamber Judgment. International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia, 2002, 121 International Law Reports 213 (2002)&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Special Court for Sierra Leone]].&lt;ref&gt;Special Court for Sierra Leone: Prosecutor v. Kallon and Kamara, Appeals Chamber: Decision on Challenge to Jurisdiction: Lome Accord Amnesty&lt;/ref&gt; But scholars have suggested that there should be room for amnesties which were imperative necessities to achieve peace and accompanied by effective Truth and Reconciliation Commissions.&lt;ref&gt;Antonio Cassesse. 2003. International Criminal Law. New York: Oxford University Press, pp315-316&lt;/ref&gt; One particular case was in Uruguay: the controversial [[Law on the Expiration of the Punitive Claims of the State]] pretended to put an end to unsolved issues deriving from 12 years of [[civic-military dictatorship of Uruguay|civic-military dictatorship]]; local human rights organizations challenged that law and called a [[Uruguayan amnesty referendum, 1989|referendum in 1989]] which confirmed the law by 56% of the popular vote.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.elpais.com.uy/09/02/28/predit_401629.asp |title=La ley de caducidad |accessdate=30 October 2010 |author=[[Francisco Gallinal]] |date=28 February 2009 |publisher=[[El País (Uruguay)|El País]] |language=es}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Related uses of the term ==
* The term '''amnesty''' is also any initiative where individuals are encouraged to turn over illicit items to the authorities, on the understanding that they will not be prosecuted for having been in possession of those items. A common use of such amnesties is to reduce the number of firearms or other weapons in circulation. Several public schools with a zero-tolerance policy on drugs or weapons have an "amnesty box" in which students may dispose of contraband objects brought to school without consequence.
* '''Amnesty''' was used in South Africa, during the 1990s, as part of the '''TRC''' ([[Truth and Reconciliation]])
*An '''[[amnesty law]]''' is any law that [[Ex post facto law|retroactively]] exempts a select group of people, usually military leaders and government leaders,  from criminal liability for crimes committed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.crimesofwar.org/thebook/amnesty.html Amnesty] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101121075359/http://www.crimesofwar.org/thebook/amnesty.html |date=November 21, 2010 }} By William Bourdon, [[Crimes of War Project]], The Book&lt;/ref&gt;
* In the [[Illegal immigration to the United States|illegal immigration debate]], allowing illegal immigrants to legally remain in the United States is often called, usually by its opponents, '''amnesty'''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.afsc.org/immigrants-rights/policy/legalization-amnesty.htm Legalization or Amnesty? : Immigrants' Rights : AFSC&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070712001518/http://www.afsc.org/immigrants-rights/policy/legalization-amnesty.htm |date=July 12, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some observers contend that the word amnesty is improperly applied here. One reason is that the proposals under consideration include financial penalties for illegal immigrants. Another reason is that the government's current practice is generally to deport but not prosecute illegal immigrants and so there is sometimes no legal adjudication of "guilt" to be forgiven.
* Many libraries have an '''amnesty week''' where people can return late library books and they will not be charged a fine for having them out.
* At the [[United States Military Academy]], United States Air Force Academy,  and the [[United States Naval Academy]], any head of state visiting the academy may ask the Superintendent to grant amnesty to members of the Corps of Cadets with outstanding punishment tours, freeing the restricted cadets from further punishment tours. In the past this was for all offenses, but in recent times only cadets with minor offenses (company board) are eligible for amnesty, while cadets with major offenses (regimental or higher board) are ineligible.

The oldest [[Sorbian languages|Sorbian]] Bible version, that of the New Testament of 1547, is extant in a manuscript in the Royal Library at Berlin. The translator was [[Miklawš Jakubica]],&lt;ref&gt;Tone Glavan Lužiški Srbi  - 1966 "Prvi, ki se je lotil pisanja v svojem jeziku, pravzaprav prevajanja v srbski jezik, je bil MIKLAWŠ JAKUBICA, ...

In a revised form this version was published by the British and Foreign Bible Society in 1860. The Old Testament, translated by J. F. Fritz, was printed at [[Cottbus]] in 1796.&lt;ref&gt;Text, Wort, Glaube: - Page 150  Kurt Aland, Martin Brecht  "Damit war zugleich die letzte Gelegenheit verpaßt, die seit 1728 vorliegende obersorbische Vollbibel auch zur ... doch erst am Ende des Jahrhunderts (1796), während die erste Ausgabe der niedersorbischen Vollbibel durch JF Fritz und JSF Schindler gar bis 1824 auf sich"&lt;/ref&gt; An edition of the entire Bible was published by the Prussian Bible Society in 1868.

A complete edition of the Bible, the work of different scholars, was first published at [[Bautzen]], 1728. A second revised edition was prepared by Johann Gottfried Kühn and issued in 1742; a third improved edition prepared by Johann Jacob Petschke was published in 1797. Passing over other editions, the ninth edition of the complete Bible ([[Bautzen]], 1881) was revised by H. Immisch and others and also contains a history of the Upper Lusatian Wendish Bible translation. G. Lusanski and M. Hornik translated the New Testament from the Vulgate for the Roman Catholic Wends of [[Upper Lusatia]] and published it at Bautzen, 1887–92; the Psalms were translated from the Hebrew by J. Laras (Bautzen, 1872).

[[File:Seattle - Moore Theatre - poles1.jpg|thumb| A selection of stage braces]]

In theater, a '''brace''' is a sliding  piece of [[wood]] or [[metal]] with a 'butterfly' winged nut to make it longer or shorter to fit the flat used to stabilize a flat [[set (theater)|set]] piece such as a [[flats (theatre)|flat]]. The nut is used, so that it can be changed more quickly than a screw to the floor during a quick change. Usually, a brace is painted black to make it less noticeable to the audience. Braces are often used to form a triangle between two perpendicular items (like a vertical flat and a [[stage (theatre)|stage]]. They can also make a flat piece stronger by forming an X-shape between all four corners. Another way to brace a [[rectangular]] flat is to use special braces, called ''toggles'' which run at regular intervals, [[Parallel (geometry)|parallel]] to the short end of the flat, effectively breaking it into many smaller, stronger rectangles.

'''Chakato''' is a [[West Chadic languages|West Chadic]] language spoken in [[Plateau State]], [[Nigeria]]. It was identified by [[Roger Blench]] in 2016.&lt;ref name="Blench2017"&gt;Blench, Roger. 2017.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2221">The '''de Wahl's rule''' is a rule of word formation, developed by [[Baltic German]] naval officer and teacher [[Edgar de Wahl]] and applied in the [[constructed language]] [[Interlingue]] (also called "Occidental") which was also his creation.

The rule served for the formation of certain changed grammatical forms, like adjectives and nouns, from verb infinitive.

==Rule==
Verb [[infinitive]]s in Interlingue end in '''-ar''', '''-ir''' or '''-er'''. The root is obtained by the following way:
# If, after the removal of '''-r''' or '''-er''' of the infinitive, the root ends in a vowel, the final '''-t''' is added or the final '''y''' is changed into '''t''': ''crea/r, crea/t-, crea/t/or; atiny/er, atin/t, atin/t/ion''
# If the root ends in consonants '''d''' or '''r''', they are changed into '''s''': ''decid/er, deci/s-, deci/s/ion''
# In all other cases, with six exceptions, the removal of the ending gives the exact root: ''duct/er, duct-, duct/ion''.

These six exceptions are
# ''ced/er, cess-''
# ''sed/er, sess-''
# ''mov/er, mot-''
# ''ten/er, tent-''
# ''vert/er, vers-''
# ''veni/r, vent-''
and the verbs formed out of them using prefixes.

Because the rule is actually made of three parts, it also known as the "three rules of de Wahl".

The nouns and adjectives are created by removing the ending and thus obtaining the root. After adding '''-r''' or '''-er''', one obtains the infinitive in the majority of cases: ''decora/t/ion, decora/t-, decora/r''.

==Application==
This rule is applied in the language Occidental. After a possible modification one can apply this rule to create new forms of a word especially in Romance languages or in languages which borrowed vocabulary from Romance languages.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1973">'''Deidentification''' is defined as the process in which one [[sibling]] defines their [[Identity (social science)|identity]] by intentionally attempting to be different from the other. [[Adolescent]]s begin to go through deidentification for a number of reasons. It commonly occurs as a result from issues within the [[sibling relationship]]. Adolescents go through deidentification as a [[defense mechanism]] for eliminating [[sibling rivalry]].&lt;ref name="SFF"/&gt; When siblings closely resemble each other, it can make finding an identity difficult. This can lead to strong [[Competitiveness|competitive]] behaviors and increased [[aggression]] between siblings. One survey concluded that 62% of [[high school senior]]s had physically struck their sibling in the past year.&lt;ref name="MRH"/&gt; The Process of deidentification decreases the chance of sibling rivalry. Deidentification allows them to branch off to form their own, different identity and to become familiarized with their individual [[Personality type|personality]]. According to [[research]], they may also begin the process of deidentification to protect themselves from social comparison.&lt;ref name="WSD"/&gt; Not all siblings will go through deidentification. It is more common in siblings who share common characteristics, such as age and sex.

'''Dhi''' (Sanskrit: धी), this [[Sanskrit]] word means 'understanding', 'reflection', 'religious thought', 'mind', 'design', 'intelligence', 'opinion', 'meditation', 'imagination', 'notion', 'intellect',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sanskrit Dictionary|publisher=Spokensanskrit.de|url= http://spokensanskrit.de/index.php?script=HK&amp;beginning=0+&amp;tinput=dhi+&amp;trans=Translate&amp;direction=AU }}&lt;/ref&gt; This word is directly connected with the word, [[Vāc]] (Sanskrit: वाच) meaning Speech, derived from Vac (Sanskrit: वच) meaning, 'to speak'. ''Dhi'' is the voiced ''Vāc'' or '[[Speech]]', it is the thought-mind or intellect. ''Dhi'' also means 'to hold' or 'to place', and indicates the activity of the intellect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Vedic Symbolism|author=Sri Aurobindo|publisher=Lotus Press|page=26|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iR1L8V8bxqgC&amp;pg=PA26&amp;dq=dhi+vedas&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=iWHNUtqjB8nKhAfCy4GYCA&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=dhi%20vedas&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==

The natural meaning of ''Dhi'' is '[[Thought]]' which corresponds to the [[Sanskrit]] word ''[[Buddhi]]'' which means 'the activity of mind', 'thought', 'understanding' and 'intelligence'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Hymns to the Mystic Fire|author=Sri Aurobindo|publisher=Lotus Press|page=15|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WuOFGN8s4s0C&amp;pg=PA15&amp;dq=dhi+upanishads&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=-V7NUvuqMYmShgeT7YGACw&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=dhi%20upanishads&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Vedic Sanskrit]] employs two words ''Dhi'' and [[Brahman]] for prayerful or meditative contemplation in which context ''Dhi'' means 'visionary insight', 'intense thought and reflection', and the word Brahman is derived from the root ''brh'', meaning 'to grow', 'to expand'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Integrity of the Yoga Darsana|author=Ian Whicher|publisher=SUNY Press|page=311|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_Qo9K9hPvQgC&amp;pg=PA311&amp;dq=dhi+upanishads&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=u1_NUtTwBdKShgfKjYDQBg&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=dhi%20upanishads&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Manu Smriti]] describes ten essential rules for observance of [[Dharma]] (the path of righteousness or the 'Law of Being', which binds the people of this world and the whole creation) – ''Dhriti'' ('patience'), ''[[Kshama]]'' ('forgiveness'), ''Dama'' ('self-control'), ''[[Asteya]]'' ('honesty'), ''Shauch'' ('purity'), ''Indriya-nigrah'' ('control of senses'), ''Dhi'' ('reasoning'), ''Vidya'' ('knowledge and learning'), ''[[Satya]]'' ('truthfulness') and ''[[Akrodha]]'' ('control of anger').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Basics of Hinduism|author=Shivendra Kumar Sinha|publisher=Unicorn Books|page=31|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pSOEETzRVqsC&amp;pg=PA31&amp;dq=dhi+upanishads&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=CmDNUuGSH5GjhgeqioH4Dg&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=dhi%20upanishads&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Application==

'''Dhi''', the prefix of ''Dhimahi'' and ''Dhiyo'' occurring in the [[Gayatri Mantra]] ([[Rig Veda]]III.62.10) refers to 'understanding', and its cognate word ''Buddhi'' means 'reasoning faculty of the mind', which understanding must be transcended to experience the Ultimate Reality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Indian Philosophy: An Introduction|author=M.Ram Murty|publisher=Broadview Press|page=15|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=chQjTOdnlLIC&amp;pg=PA15&amp;dq=dhi+upanishads&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=CmDNUuGSH5GjhgeqioH4Dg&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=dhi%20upanishads&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; The word, ''Dhira'', meaning 'calm', denotes the seeker whose intellect is saturated in knowledge which word is the combination of ''Dhi'' meaning 'intellect' and ''ra'' meaning 'fire' or 'wisdom'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Jnana Sankalini Tantra|author=Paramhansa Prjnananda|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|page=191|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bq-LDHAYbzAC&amp;pg=PA191&amp;dq=dhi+upanishads&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=CmDNUuGSH5GjhgeqioH4Dg&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=dhi%20upanishads&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The Non-Atman i.e. the [[Anatman (Hinduism)|Anatman]], which is by its nature disagreeable, is the object of the function of ''Dhi'' (=''buddhi'') which reveals the joy (''ananda''), the nature of the individual consciousness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Suresvara’s Vartika on Yajnavalkya’s – Maitreyi Dialogue|author=Suresvaracharya|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|page=112|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dvcrBnKaIgEC&amp;pg=PA112&amp;dq=dhi+upanishads&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=r2DNUt3nGIm7hAep9IDYBw&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=dhi%20upanishads&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Patanjali]] defines [[Yoga]] as neutralization of the alternating waves in consciousness; in the phrase ''citta vritti nirodha'' (Yoga Sutra I.2), ''[[Citta]]'' refers to the 'thinking principle' and includes 'pranic life forces', to ''[[Manas (early Buddhism)|Manas]]'' ('mind' or 'sense consciousness'), ''[[Ahamkara]]'' ('egoity') and ''[[Buddhi]]'' ('intuitive intelligence'), and ''[[Vritti]]'' refers to the waves of thought and emotion that ceaselessly arise and [[Nirodha]] refers to 'neutralization', 'cessation' or 'control'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Autobiography of a Yogi|author=Sri Paramhansa Yogananda|publisher=Diamond Pocket Books|page=224|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xsIi4ePN4hYC&amp;pg=PA224&amp;dq=dhi+upanishads&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=r2DNUt3nGIm7hAep9IDYBw&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=dhi%20upanishads&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; The root ''budh'' and its derivatives appear in the [[Vedas]] in the sense of 'kindling' or 'awakening', the word ''buddhi'' appears for the first time in ''Samkhyayana Brahmana Upanishad''. ''Dhi'' is derived from ''dhriti'' and its cognate ''didhiti'', it also refers to flash of intuition which is beyond all purely sensuous perception.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Hindu Spirituality Vedas Through Vedanta|author=Krishna Sivaraman|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|page=192,210|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lktl97WdxWkC&amp;pg=PA192&amp;dq=dhi+vedas&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=iWHNUtqjB8nKhAfCy4GYCA&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=dhi%20vedas&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; The mental organs are ''manas'' ('mind') and ''hrd'' ('heart'), and the mental faculties are ''citta'' ('thought'), ''dhi'' ('mental vision') and ''kratu'' ('mental power'). ''Manas'' is said to perform the processes indicated by the verbal roots '''cit-'', ''dhi-'' and ''man-''; ''dhi'' requires ''kratu'' in actualizing visions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Origins of Indian Psychology|author=N.Ross Reat|publisher=Jain Publishing Co.|pages=96–135|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=T0nHmSni1NEC&amp;pg=PA130&amp;dq=dhi+vedas&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=vmLNUq71OJGrhAfKuYCYAg&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=dhi%20vedas&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Connection with Vāc==

'''Dhi''' refers to 'vision' or 'inspiration which is the exceptional faculty of acquiring a sudden knowledge of transcendent truth or reality', 'the inner light of visionary insight'. [[Soma (deity)|Soma]] is the Lord of Vision who dispenses inspiration and Speech (Vāc) is inspired thought (''manisa'') or wisdom guarded by the seers on the seat of ''[[Rta]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Vedic Literature (Samhitas and Brahmanas)|author=Jan Gonda|publisher=Otto Harrasowitz Veriag|pages=66–71|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ogb24XeQOZ8C&amp;pg=PA67&amp;dq=dhi+vedas&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=iWHNUtqjB8nKhAfCy4GYCA&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=dhi%20vedas&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Rig Veda]] links language not only to thought (''manas'') but also to vision (''dhi''), a word from which comes ''[[Dhyana in Hinduism|Dhyana]]'' meaning 'meditation'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Discovering the Vedas: Origins, Mantras, Rituals, Insights|author=Frits Staal|publisher=Penguin Books|page=293|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HcE23SjLX8sC&amp;pg=PA293&amp;dq=dhi+vedas&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=iWHNUtqjB8nKhAfCy4GYCA&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=dhi%20vedas&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In the [[Yajurveda]] (29.8), [[Sarasvati]], the Goddess of Speech, is invoked to grant the gift of ''Dhi'', inspired thought, and thought is linked with ''Vāc''; [[Sarasvati River|Sarasvati]] is also known as the river of inspired thought,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Sarasvati, Riverine Goddess of Knowledge|author=Catherine Ludvik|publisher=BRILL|pages=|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4lsYKIXBOK0C&amp;pg=PA27&amp;dq=dhi+vedas&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=vmLNUq71OJGrhAfKuYCYAg&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=dhi%20vedas&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Vedas]] are the sacred texts of the [[Hindus]]. They are the repository of what is the known or required to be known, in other words, the true knowledge or the transcendent eternal wisdom articulated in [[Sound]] ('sabda') or [[Speech]] ('vāc'). The [[Vedic]] [[Rishi|seers]] have associated the power of speech or the spoken word with ultimacy and transcendence – ''ekam sat'' ([[Rig Veda]] I.164.46). They also know [[Vishwakarma]], the creator, as Vācaspati, the Lord of Speech ([[Rig Veda]] X.81.7) (who is also called [[Brihaspati]] and Brahmanaspati), and that Vāc or speech or utterance as [[Brahman]] is the creative principle and the absolute force in the universe; the person who has gained its knowledge is said to have attained the highest knowledge ([[Rig Veda]] X.125.5). As far as Brahman extends so far does ''Vāc'' ([[Rig Veda]] X.114.8).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Beyond the Written Word: Oral Aspects of Scripture in the History of Religion|author=William A.graham|publisher=Cambridge University Press|pages=|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XzYX0T-ZqTcC&amp;pg=PA70&amp;dq=vac+veda&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=6_3MUr2vGZGihgeDh4DYBA&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=vac%20veda&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Role of Vāc==

The Inspired thought (''dhi'') that precedes utterance though connected with speech undergoes some modifications while being transformed into speech; the [[Vedic]] [[Rishis]] tell us that the thoughtful one's produce speech with their mind ([[Rig Veda]] X.71.2), the different stages in transformation from ''dhi'' to ''vāc'' are described in the [[Atharvaveda]] (VII.1.1). ''Dhi'' is the voiced speech. Goddess Saraswati presides over speech but ''vāc'' extends far above and beyond Saraswati ([[Rig Veda]] X.125) beyond all known spheres ([[Rig Veda]] X.114.8). Vāc is dependent on breath or air; and the [[Aitareya Brahmana]] (IV.42.1) states ''Brahman vai vāk'', Vāc is the mother of the Vedas and the Vedas themselves ([[Shatapatha Brahmana]] (6.5.3.4).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Sarasvati, Riverine Goddess of Knowledge|author=Catherine Ludvik|publisher=BRILL|pages=33, 37, 60|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4lsYKIXBOK0C&amp;pg=PA60&amp;dq=vac+veda&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=6_3MUr2vGZGihgeDh4DYBA&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=vac%20veda&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The Vedas are a form of the ritual and cosmological ''Vāc'' (speech). Vāc is presented as consort of [[Prajapati]] (Kathaka Samhita 12.5.27.1) whom the Brahmanas  express as 'the expressed' (''nirukta'') and as the 'unexpressed' (''anirukta''), the limited and the unlimited. [[Taittiriya Aranyaka]] tells us that Vāc is the imperishable one, the (''[[Aksara]]''), the first-born of the cosmic order (''[[Rta]]''), the mother of the Vedas (''vedanam mata''), the navel of immortality (''[[Amrita]]'') and therefore Vedas themselves are infinite (''[[Ananta (infinite)|Ananta]]''), immortal (''amrta'') and imperishable (''akshita''). The ''Jaiminiya Upanishad'' tells us that [[Om|Aum]] or Om, the essence of all essences, is [[Vāc]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Authority, Anxiety, and Canon: Essays in Vedic Interpretation|author=Barbara A.Holdrege|publisher=SUNY Press|pages=2, 40, 49|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3Z8CGJBo3z4C&amp;pg=PA40&amp;dq=vac+veda&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=6_3MUr2vGZGihgeDh4DYBA&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=vac%20veda&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the human plane the mind precedes speech, and on the cosmic plane Prajapati precedes ''vāc'' as the Lord of Thought and Speech, who brings forth ''vāc'' to unite with ''vāc'' to manifest creation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Veda and Torah: Transcending the Textuality of Scripture|author= Barbara A.Holdrege|publisher=SUNY Press|page=48|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=v_H31Q_eq84C&amp;pg=PA47&amp;dq=vac+veda&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=6_3MUr2vGZGihgeDh4DYBA&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=vac%20veda&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For the purpose of invoking [[Agni]] and other ''[[Devatas (Vedanta)|devatas]]'', the [[mantra]]s of the [[Rig Veda]] have a very essential role to play because the ''Upasaka'' when meditating is required to think of the Rcs as Vāc i.e. speech; it is for this reason that the mantras are chanted and there is a prescribed way to do that chanting. Rishi [[Medhātithi|Medhatithi Kanva]] ([[Rig Veda]] I.12.11) prays:

:स नः सत्वान आ भर गायत्रेन नवीयसा |
:रयिं वीरवतिमिषम् ||

"May Agni accept the words of praise (adoration) set in newer hymns composed in Gayatri metre and devoutly sung (chanted), (May Agni) accept the oblations made in it (in the prescribed manner) of the offerings rightly earned and belonging to the performers of rites." And, Rishi Ayasya (Rig Veda IX.46.2) praying thus-

:परिष्कृतास इन्दवो योषेव पित्र्यावती |
:वायुं सोमा असृक्षत ||

informs us that having acquired the knowledge of the highest the learned people (easily) unravel the deeply hidden meaning of the most subtle kind. This means, that each experience of ours is a re-discovery of ourselves, and that in order to really re-discover ourselves so as to understand our true nature we have to firstly awaken our mind, then make the mind speak loudly enough to be heard because [[Prana]], which is the body of the mind, is that very silence waiting to be heard. A sage of the Rig Veda (Rig Veda X.20.9) states that the creator vested ''[[Agni]]'' with three coloured flames and made it brilliant, eminent, swift-acting and hot. The sage of the [[Chandogya Upanishad]] tells us that behind all things are these three colours, the rest constituted out of them are a modification and a name. Speech is Rk or ''[[Brhati]]'' identified with ''[[Prana]]'' whose lord is [[Brihaspati]], the same lord is Brahmanaspati when speech is ''[[Yajus]]'' associated with Brahman. Speech is ''Sama''; it cannot reveal itself for it is as formless as the air on which it rides; it rides upon the streams of air constituting the wind, and words once uttered do not return to the speaker.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Illumination of Knowledge|author=Ravinder Kumar Soni|publisher=GBD Books|pages=47, 77, 62, 87, 93|url=https://www.amazon.in/s?ie=UTF8&amp;field-author=Ravinder%20Kumar%20Soni&amp;page=1&amp;rh=n%3A976389031%2Cp_27%3ARavinder%20Kumar%20Soni}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Yajnavalkya]] tells King [[Janaka]] that the light that comes nearest to the supreme light of the [[Atman (Hinduism)|Atman]] is the light of Vāc i.e. speech, since it is the supreme faculty of reason that finally lifts the consciousness towards the pure self-shining awareness of the Atman, and which after serving as a pointer vanishes or goes to rest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Encyclopaedic Dictionary of the Upanishads Vol.3|author=Swami Parmeshwaranad|publisher=-Sarup and Sons|page=309|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Mgwzp6-HTTIC&amp;pg=PA309&amp;dq=vac+upanishads&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=kwXNUraJJZGThQfFwIGABw&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=vac%20upanishads&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Vedic sages have all along advocated 'Truth', 'Penance' and 'Study' as special virtues. Amongst these three special virtues Truth is held out to be the supreme virtue to be practised by all aspirants. All primary virtues are firstly imbibed from the parents; [[Satyakama Jabala]] acquired the spirit of truthfulness from his mother, and [[Sanat Kumara]] taught [[Narada]] that Truth has to be sought for realization – "when one indeed understands Truth in its reality one speaks the truth".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=In Search of True Happiness|author=Ravinder Kumar Soni|publisher=Soni Parivar|page=14|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Claim for primacy==

A sage of the [[Chandogya Upanishad]] after declaring that the syllable ''[[Om|Aum]]'', having the individual and also the cosmic efficacy, not only serves to help the meditation of the individual person but even the Sun travels the universe singing ''Aum'' as does ''Prana'' moving in the body (Ch.Up.I.5.1,3) explains that that ''[[Om|Aum]]'' is the essence of all beings on this earth, the essence of a person is speech and the essence of speech is the [[Rig Veda]] (Ch.Up.I.1.2) but the essence of [[Samaveda]], which is the essence of the Rig Veda, is ''[[Om|Udgitha]]'' which is ''Aum''. He declares that all speech is interwoven on the symbol ''Aum'', in the same manner as the leaves of a tree are woven together on a stalk (Ch.Up.II.23.3). Speech is the fuel of fire which is man (Ch.Up.V.7.1). Mind consists of 'food', the Prana consists of 'water' and speech consists of 'fire' (Ch.Up.VI.6.5). [[Narada]] is told by [[Sanat Kumara]] that all this is but a name by which one knows, even then speech is greater than name because if there is no speech neither righteousness nor unrighteousness would be known, but surely the mind is greater than speech for mind  is the entire world (Ch.Up.VII.2 &amp; 3) establishing the claim of the mind (''dhi'') for primacy over speech (''vāc'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A Constructive Survey of Upanishadic Philosophy|author=R.D.Ranade|publisher=Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan|pages=83, 214, 245|url=https://archive.org/stream/A.Constructive.Survey.of.Upanishadic.Philosophy.by.R.D.Ranade.1926.djvu/A.Constructive.Survey.of.Upanishadic.Philosophy.by.R.D.Ranade.1926_djvu.txt}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''container''' or '''wrapper format''' is a [[metafile]] [[File format|format]] whose specification describes how different elements of data and [[metadata]] coexist in a [[computer file]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pDU0DAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT146&amp;dq=container+format|title=Handbook of Digital Forensics of Multimedia Data and Devices, Enhanced E-Book|last=Ho|first=Anthony T. S.|last2=Li|first2=Shujun|date=20 May 2016|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|year=|isbn=9781118757079|location=|pages=146–(?)|oclc=953319457}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the earliest [[cross-platform]] container formats were [[Distinguished Encoding Rules]] and the 1985 [[Interchange File Format]]. Containers are frequently used in [[multimedia]] applications.

==Properties==
Since the container does not describe how data or metadata is encoded, a [[Computer program|program]] able to identify and open a container file might not be able to decode the contained data. This may be caused by the program lacking the required [[Codec|decoding algorithm]].

By definition, a container format could wrap any kind of data. Though there are some examples of such file formats (e.g. [[Microsoft Windows]]'s [[Dynamic-link library|DLL]] files), most container formats are specialized for specific data requirements. For example, a popular family of containers is found for use with multimedia file formats. Since [[Audio file format|audio]] and video streams can be coded and decoded with many different algorithms, a container format may be used to provide a single file format to the user.

==Multimedia container formats==
{{further|Audio file format|Image file format|Video file format}}
{{See also|Comparison of container formats}}

The container file is used to identify and interleave different data types. Simpler container formats can contain different types of audio formats, while more advanced container formats can support multiple audio and video streams, [[Subtitle (captioning)|subtitles]], chapter-information, and meta-data ([[Tag (metadata)|tags]]) — along with the synchronization information needed to play back the various streams together. In most cases, the file header, most of the metadata and the synchro chunks are specified by the container format. For example, container formats exist for optimized, low-quality, internet video streaming which differs from high-quality Blu-ray streaming requirements.

Container format parts have various names: "chunks" as in RIFF and PNG, "atoms" in QuickTime/MP4, "packets" in MPEG-TS (from the communications term), and "segments" in JPEG. The main content of a chunk is called the "data" or "payload". Most container formats have chunks in sequence, each with a header, while [[TIFF]] instead stores offsets.  Modular chunks make it easy to recover other chunks in case of file corruption or dropped frames or [[bit slip]], while offsets result in [[Serial communications|framing errors]] in cases of bit slip.

Some containers are exclusive to audio:
* [[Audio Interchange File Format|AIFF]] (IFF file format, widely used on [[Mac OS]] platform)
* [[WAV]]  ([[Resource Interchange File Format|RIFF]] file format, widely used on [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] platform)
* [[Extensible Music Format (XMF)|XMF]] (Extensible Music Format)

Other containers are exclusive to still images:
* [[FITS]] (Flexible Image Transport System) still images, raw data, and associated metadata.
* [[Tagged Image File Format|TIFF]] (Tagged Image File Format) still images and associated metadata.

Other flexible containers can hold many types of audio and video, as well as other media. The most popular multi-media containers are:
* [[3GP]] (used by many mobile phones; based on the [[ISO base media file format]])
* [[Advanced Systems Format|ASF]] (container for Microsoft [[Windows Media Audio|WMA]] and [[Windows Media Video|WMV]], which today usually do not use a container)
* [[Audio Video Interleave|AVI]] (the standard [[Microsoft Windows]] container, also based on [[Resource Interchange File Format|RIFF]])
* [[DVR-MS]] ("Microsoft Digital Video Recording", [[Proprietary software|proprietary]] video container format developed by Microsoft based on [[Advanced Systems Format|ASF]])
* [[Flash Video]] (FLV, F4V) (container for video and audio from [[Adobe Systems]])
* [[Interchange File Format|IFF]] (first platform-independent container format)
* [[Matroska]] (MKV) (not limited to any coding format, as it can hold virtually anything; it is an [[open standard]] container format)
* MJ2 - Motion [[JPEG 2000]] file format, based on the [[ISO base media file format]] which is defined in MPEG-4 Part 12 and JPEG 2000 Part 12
* [[QuickTime File Format]] (standard [[QuickTime]] video container from [[Apple Inc.]])
* [[MPEG program stream]] (standard container for MPEG-1 and MPEG-2 [[elementary stream]]s on reasonably reliable media such as disks; used also on [[DVD-Video]] discs)
* [[MPEG transport stream|MPEG-2 transport stream]] (a.k.a. MPEG-TS) (standard container for digital broadcasting and for transportation over unreliable media; used also on [[Blu-ray Disc]] video; typically contains multiple video and audio streams, and an [[electronic program guide]])
* [[MPEG-4 Part 14|MP4]] (standard audio and video container for the [[MPEG-4]] multimedia portfolio, based on the ISO base media file format defined in [[MPEG-4 Part 12]] and JPEG 2000 Part 12) which in turn was based on the QuickTime file format.
* [[Ogg]] (standard container for [[Xiph.Org Foundation|Xiph.org]] audio formats [[Vorbis]] and [[Opus (audio format)|Opus]] and video format [[Theora]])
* [[RealMedia|RM]] (RealMedia; standard container for [[RealVideo]] and [[RealAudio]])

There are many other container formats, such as [[FFmpeg#NUT|NUT]], [[Material Exchange Format|MXF]], [[General Exchange Format|GXF]], [[ratDVD]], SVI, [[VOB]] and [[DivX Media Format]]

==Single coding formats==
In addition to pure container formats, which specify ''only'' the wrapper but not the coding, a number of file formats specify ''both'' a storage layer and the coding, as part of [[modular design]] and [[forward compatibility]].

Examples include [[JPEG File Interchange Format]] (JFIF) for containing [[JPEG]] data, and [[Portable Network Graphics]] (PNG).

In principle, coding can be changed while the storage layer is retained; for example, [[Multiple-image Network Graphics]] (MNG) uses the PNG container format but provides animation, while [[JPEG Network Graphics]] (JNG) puts JPEG encoded data in a PNG container; in both cases however, the different formats have different [[Magic number (programming)|magic numbers]] – the format specifies the coding, though a MNG can contain both PNG-encoded images and JPEG-encoded images.

==Issues==
{{original research|section|date=January 2011}}
The differences between various container formats arise from five main issues:
# Popularity; how widely supported a container is.
# Overhead.  This is the difference in file-size between two files with the same content in a different container.
# Support for advanced codec functionality.  Older formats such as AVI do not support new codec features like [[B-frame]]s, [[Variable bitrate|VBR]] audio or [[Variable frame rate|VFR]] video natively. The format may be "hacked" to add support, but this creates compatibility problems.
# Support for advanced content, such as chapters, subtitles, meta-tags, user-data.
# Support of [[streaming media]].

He was born 19 February 1893 in [[Quiapo, Manila]], the [[Philippines]].  His ancestry was [[Philippines|Filipino]] with slight admixture of [[Han Chinese|Chinese]].  He was [[baptized]] in 1906 at the age of thirteen in [[San Isidro, Luzon]] by Bishop G.A. Miller, and was educated in the U.S. and the Philippines.  He became a Member in Full Connection of the Philippine Islands [[Annual Conference]] in 1918.  He was [[ordained]] Deacon by Bishop Eveland and Elder by Bishops Stuntz and J.W. Robinson.  Alejandro was the first delegate to the [[Central Conference]] of Southern Asia.  Prior to his election to the Episcopacy he served as an [[Evangelism|evangelist]], an [[educator]], a [[pastor]] and an [[editing|editor]].

He was elected a Bishop during the [[Japan]]ese [[Military occupation|occupation]] of the Philippines.  Thus, he was not [[consecrated]] until 1946 (i.e., after liberation).  He served the [[Manila]] Episcopal Area of the [[Philippines Central Conference]] of The Methodist Church.  He was the Presiding Bishop of the Philippines and the Northern Philippines Annual Conferences.

Dionisio Alejandro was the first president of Philippine Wesleyan College (now [[Wesleyan University (Philippines)]]) from 1946 - 1947.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4794">'''Drunk dialing''' is an [[alcohol intoxication|intoxicated]] person making phone calls that they would not likely make if [[Sobriety|sober]], often a lonely individual calling former or current love interests.

In [[Kurt Vonnegut]]'s 1969 novel ''Slaughterhouse-Five'', the main character describes his tendency to drunk dial:
{{quote|I have this disease late at night sometimes, involving alcohol and the telephone.  I get drunk, and I drive my wife away with breath like mustard gas and roses.  And then, speaking gravely and elegantly into the telephone, I ask the telephone operators to connect me with this friend or that one, from whom I have not heard in years.|[[Kurt Vonnegut]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Vonnegut |first= Kurt |title= [[Slaughterhouse-Five]] |publisher= [[Dell Publishing]] |date=December 1991 |isbn= 0-440-18029-5 |page=4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In the 2004 film ''[[Sideways (film)|Sideways]]'', Miles Raymond ([[Paul Giamatti]]) gets drunk and calls his ex-wife while at a restaurant. When he returns to the table, his friend Jack ([[Thomas Haden Church]]) asks him, "Did you drink and dial?"

Drunk [[text messaging|texting]], emailing, and editing internet sites are related phenomena, and potentially yet more embarrassing for the sender as, when the message is sent, it cannot be rescinded; the message may be misspelled (due to being drunk), and it might be reviewed and shared among many.

'''East Timorese Portuguese''' (''Português timorense'' in [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]]) is a Portuguese [[Portuguese dialects|dialect]] spoken in the country of [[Timor-Leste]] or East Timor. It is one of the official languages of Timor-Leste alongside [[Tetum]].

==History==

Timorese Portuguese is a legacy of Portuguese rule of Timor-Leste (called [[Portuguese Timor]]) from the 16th century. It had its first contact during the Portuguese discoveries of the East, but it was largely exposed to Portuguese Timor in the 18th century after its division from the rest of the island by the [[Netherlands]].  

However, Tetum remained the main [[lingua franca]] of Timor-Leste during Portuguese rule, although the most commonly used form, known as ''Tetun-Prasa'' used in [[Dili]], was heavily influenced by Portuguese. Following the [[Carnation Revolution]] in Portugal in 1974, political parties emerged in Portuguese Timor for the first time, all of which supported the continued use of Portuguese, including [[APODETI]], the only party to advocate integration with [[Indonesia]], which stated that it would support the right to "enjoy the Portuguese language" alongside Indonesian.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=LU4bAAAAMAAJ&amp;dq=Jill+Jolliffe+Nationalism+and+Colonialism&amp;q=Apodeti&amp;pgis=1 East Timor: Nationalism and Colonialism] Jill Jolliffe, University of Queensland Press, 1978, page 326&lt;/ref&gt;  

On December 7, 1975, nine days after declaring independence from Portugal, Timor-Leste was  [[Indonesian invasion of East Timor|invaded]] by [[Indonesia]], which declared the territory as its 27th province in 1976, with [[Indonesian language|Indonesian]] as the sole official language. During the [[Indonesian occupation of East Timor|Indonesian occupation]], the use of Portuguese in education, administration and the media was banned by the Indonesian authorities, which saw the language as a threat.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www1.ci.uc.pt/timor/language.htm Colonization, Decolonization and Integration: Language Policies in East Timor, Indonesia]&lt;/ref&gt;
This was despite the fact that the 'People's Assembly', which petitioned [[President of Indonesia|President]] [[Suharto]] for integration with Indonesia, conducted its proceedings in Portuguese, under a banner reading "Integração de Timor Timur na República da Indonésia" (Integration of East Timor into the Republic of Indonesia).&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20090908051521/http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,914226-2,00.html The Making of Tim-Tim], [[Robert Kroon]], ''[[TIME]]'', June 14, 1976&lt;/ref&gt;

The last school to teach in Portuguese, the Externato São José, was closed in 1992.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=55mXS56nMPkC&amp;dq=Geoffrey+Gunn+Timor+Loro+Sae%3A+500&amp;pg=PT1&amp;lpg=PT1&amp;sig=ACfU3U2uUm22QOMu6Krlfyuu3Td-2FhKLA&amp;q=externato#PPA223,M1 ''New World Hegemony in the Malay World''], Geoffrey Gunn, The Red Sea Press, 2000, page 224&lt;/ref&gt;

The reintroduction of Portuguese as an official language aroused criticism amongst Indonesian-educated youth, but according to the 2004 census, 36.7% of respondents aged 6 years and older  (or 272,638 out of a total of 741,530) said they had “a capability in Portuguese.” &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2007/07/31/world/asia/31timor.html A New Country’s Tough Non-Elective: Portuguese 101], Seth Mydans, ''[[The New York Times]]'', July 31, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

==Social context==

After independence, Portuguese was restored by the new government of Timor-Leste as one of the official languages with Tetum, with Indonesian and English as "[[working language|''working'' languages]]".  Timor-Leste asked for help from Brazil, Portugal, and the Latin Union to spread the teaching of the language, although its prominence in official and public spheres has been met with some hostility from younger Indonesian-educated East Timorese.  

Some people in Timor-Leste have complained that teachers from Portugal and Brazil are poorly equipped to teach in the country, as they do not know local languages, or understand the local culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Phonology==

The Portuguese dialect of the older people is similar to [[Brazilian Portuguese]], [[African Portuguese|African]] and other Asian dialects. The translation for “please” is ''por favor''. It is {{IPA-pt|puʁ faˈvo|}} in Brazilian colloquial speech, {{IPA-pt|poʁ faˈvoʁ|}} or {{IPA-pt|poɾ faˈvoɾ|}} in Brazilian educated speech, {{IPA-pt|po faˈvo|}} in Timor-Leste, but {{IPA-pt|puɾ fɐˈvoɾ|}} in [[European Portuguese]]. Although Brazilian and East Timorese accents are intelligible, local government and schools are strict to teach European dialect, as [[Macau]], Portugal and [[Portuguese-speaking African countries|PALOP countries]] use, because European is the chosen pronunciation, the native pronunciation is closer to European than Brazilian even though it is midway between European and Brazilian dialects, so it is common for foreigners to hear {{IPA|[puɾ fɐˈvoɾ]}} being used in Timor-Leste. The Portuguese standard phonology is not affected by Tetum and other native languages, even though it is not a mother language of the population.

==Orthography==

Timor-Leste uses two Portuguese spelling patterns: European (which is used by Portugal, [[Portuguese-speaking African countries|PALOP]] and Macau) and Brazilian, because the government asked help from Brazil to spread Portuguese to the country. Both spelling patterns are acceptable as long as they do not affect phonology.{{citation needed|date=May 2010}}

==Lexicon==

East Timorese lexicon was also similar to Brazilian, so the translation of “I love you” in Brazil and Timor-Leste is ''(eu) te amo'', but it is ''(eu) amo-te'' in the European variety. However, ''(eu) amo-te'' is more used than ''(eu) te amo'', since European vocabulary is chosen.

She earned her PhD in Linguistics in 1969, studying with John Lyons at the [[University of Edinburgh]]. She worked on the Language Universals Project at Stanford with [[Joseph Greenberg]], and two years later, joined the Linguistics Department at [[Stanford University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://wings.buffalo.edu/cogsci/People/Distinguishedspeakers/clark.htm|title = Center for Cognitive Science|date = April 6, 2004|accessdate = January 25, 2015|website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;  She is currently the Richard Lyman Professor in the Humanities at Stanford.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://shc.stanford.edu/news/experts-bureau/eve-v-clark|title = Stanford Humanities Center|date = |accessdate = January 25, 2015|website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Clark's research focuses on first language acquisition, especially the acquisition of meaning. She has done extensive observational and experimental research. She has also worked on the acquisition and use of word-formation, including comparative studies of English and Hebrew in children and adults. Some of her current studies examine what children can learn about conventional ways to say things based on adult responses to child errors during acquisition. She has studied the pragmatics of coining words.

== Selected Research ==
Eve V. Clark's work was focused heavily on first language acquisition, the acquisition of meaning, word-formation across children and language, and the varying issues in lexicon and language use. Some of her most remarkable studies come from the interaction of children with adults, where she demonstrates how vital these interactions are for further development of language for young children.

'''&lt;big&gt;Young children's uptake of new words in conversation&lt;/big&gt;'''

Clark aimed to understand how children register words they haven’t heard before by extracting the words and transcripts from five corpora (collection of written/spoken texts) (2007). She hypothesized that, because the repetition of a new word is how children place that word into their language, there will be a difference in repeat-rates for new information and given information. To test the prediction, she compared children's repetition's of the new words to the repetition in the new-to given conversation shifts. The study consisted of 701 new words that were used and exposed to the five children. An example of the way the words were said to the children are as followed:

“Deictic term (this/that/here) + new word

(This) is an + owl

(Here) is a + whisk”

(Clark &amp; Wong, 2002)

The five corpora, or collection of written/spoken speech, were analyzed by three researchers who each observed specific children: Stanley Kuczaj (child: Abe), Jacqueline Sachs (child: Naomi) and Roger Brown (children: Adam, Eve and Sarah). Each child was recorded at different intervals, ranging from twice a week to every other week. To analyze if the children are registering the new words, it was coded every time a child repeated the new word, acknowledged or moved on. Although the children all differed on who initiate the conversation first, her results found that 54% of the time, children repeated the word in their next turn, 38% of the time the child had utterances (move-ons) which were relevant to the new word and topic, and 9% of the time the children said ‘yeah’ (acknowledgement).

Even though the children's acknowledgments were very small in terms of measurement, it displays that the children are capable of understanding and acceptance of the new words, a step forward in grounding the new terms that the adults offered. Children who moved on from the new word continued the conversation in the same semantic field, meaning that although the grasping of the new word may not be verbally recognized, the meaning behind the continued conversation displays a possible grasp on integrating the context into their understanding.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Clark |first1=Eve |title=Young children's uptake of new words in conversation |journal=Language in Society |date=2007 |volume=36 |issue=2 |page=157-182 |url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/language-in-society/article/young-childrens-uptake-of-new-words-in-conversation/BDA733C3B7A4FD332B81B3C61742154D}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From this study, Clark's results displayed that children repeated the new words about twice as much as they repeated utterance information from ordinary conversations. Her hypothesis was supported in that there is a difference in the function of repetition differs between new words and new information. Children are aware of new words, and rely on the introduction of them using the deictic frame. Clark wanted to continue this phenomenon of children and how they integrate these new words into their vocabulary, so she began to use words that young children surround themselves with everyday, but do not quite get exposed to in language, and that is color.

&lt;big&gt;'''Color, reference, and expertise in language acquisition'''&lt;/big&gt; 

Eve Clark furthered her research on children's understanding of new words, while focusing specifically on the knowledge and identification of colors. She discovered that children find difficulty in learning and understanding the label for each color, so her research led her to study tips to help children. Clark emphasized [[joint attention]] as a key piece of acquiring the terms for colors. When the child and the adult share the attention together, the child is able to learn colors, and furthermore, the complex shades and hues of that color. Along with joint attention, Clark found that in order for a child to learn the terms for colors, the child and adult must interact with conversation. Without direct attention, the child will struggle to grasp concepts on their own because there is nobody to tell them what is right or wrong. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Clark |first1=Eve |title=Color, reference and expertise in language acquisition |journal=Journal of Experimental Child Psychology |date=2006 |volume=94 |pages=339-343 |doi=10.1016/j.jecp.2006.03.002 |url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022096506000385}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Furthering her explanation, Clark tells that a child must first learn the [[hue]]. Only after the child has grasped that concept can they start to learn the [[tints and shades]]. This concept specifically grows from the interaction with an adult. The child's understanding of the tints or shade of a hue increases when presented by older individuals around them.  &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Clark |first1=Eve |title=Color, reference and expertise in language acquisition |journal=Journal of Experimental Child Psychology |date=2006 |volume=94 |pages=339-343 |doi=10.1016/j.jecp.2006.03.002 |url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022096506000385}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Eve Clark's research continues on as she explores how children acquire not only the understanding and meaning of words, but how they can use those words in context. 

'''&lt;big&gt;Conventionality and contrast in language acquisition&lt;/big&gt;'''

Eve Clark looks at how conventionality and contrast both add to language. Convention is defined as a norm, a standard everyone must follow to ensure proper communication. This rule is followed in terms of language as well as general knowledge. Everyone uses the same word to relay the same meaning, and mostly in the same way. When hearing a language for the first time, a child must figure out the meaning of the word in relation to the words around it. The contrasting words give hints to what the unknown word represents. With more context and exposure, children are able to make the connection and learn their first language. If a child and parent are at a zoo learning animals, learning the difference between two striped animals is where conventionality and contrast come in (tiger vs. zebra). While this rule can differentiate between nouns, this also applies when children figure out which tense of a verb to use (telled vs. told).

Conventionality and contrast are essential factors that help build on ones language acquisition, however, Clark also expands on how language acquisition actually can build on cognitive development as well. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Clark |first1=Eve |title=Conventionality and contrast in language and language acquisition |journal=New Directions for Child &amp; Adolescent Development |date=2007 |volume=213 |issue=142 |pages=11-23 |doi=10.1002/cad.179 |url=https://doi-org.ezproxy.csusm.edu/10.1002/cd.179 |accessdate=30 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== '''How language acquisition builds on cognitive development''' ===
Clark's accomplishments and reputation in linguistics is shown in her ability relate [[language acquisition]] to cognition. She details that cognition and language are co-extensive and children first build on what they know before language, and then use language as well in constructing additional categories. Clark's concepts on cognition in relation to language acquisition reinforce that cognition and language interact in a cyclical fashion as children learn more. Clark expresses that words might be regarded as invitations to form categories and to individuate object kinds. Also, Clark believes that language might enable analogies that allow for greater complexity of thought. When discovering language, Clark says that children learn most from their adult figures in their life and how infants pick up on the most frequent nouns, verbs, and adjectives first before extending their range.This suggests that we as children, and as people in general, use representations based not only on representations linked to specific languages, but also on their cognitive development, for categorization, identification, sorting and remembering. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Clark |first1=Eve |title=Young children's uptake of new words in conversation |journal=Language in Society |date=2007 |volume=36 |issue=2 |pages=157-182}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His topics of interest included [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]], [[Gottlob Frege]], [[Friedrich Waismann]], [[Bertrand Russell]], the [[Vienna Circle]], and [[René Descartes]]. He was noted for his collaboration with [[Peter Hacker]] and his disagreements with [[Michael Dummett]].

==Biography==
Baker was educated at [[Phillips Exeter Academy]], [[Harvard University]] (major in mathematics),&lt;ref&gt;Staff. [http://www.thecrimson.com/article/1958/11/25/phi-betes-vote-pphi-beta-kappa/ "Phi Betes Vote"], ''[[The Harvard Crimson]]'', November 25, 1958. Accessed November 2, 2012. "Phi Beta Kappa elected the Senior Sixteen in its annual fall election last night. Chosen were Gordon P. Baker of Lowell House and Englewood, N.J."&lt;/ref&gt; and, as a [[Marshall Scholarship|Marshall Scholar]], at [[The Queen's College, Oxford]], where he intended to read [[Philosophy, Politics, and Economics]] but transferred to [[Literae Humaniores]] (1960). He pursued his doctorate (1963–70) while teaching at the [[University of Kent]] and latterly as a Fellow of [[St John's College, Oxford]].

He was a Trustee of the Waismann Fund.

His other interests included [[real tennis]] and the [[harpsichord]].

He was married to Ann Pimlott (1964), with whom he had three sons, Alan, Geoffrey, and Nicholas. Alan is currently a professor of philosophy at [[Swarthmore College]]. From 1992 until his death the philosopher Katherine Morris ([[Mansfield College, Oxford]]) was his acknowledged companion.

'''Jake Adelstein''' (born March 28, 1969) is a [[United States|Jewish-American]]&lt;ref&gt;Jake Adelstein, [https://twitter.com/jakeadelstein/status/614343052086259713 "Yakuza, strippers, drugs, an undercover Japanese-Jew FBI special agent? Pulp non-fiction."], ''[[Twitter]]'', June 26, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; journalist, [[crime writer]], and blogger who has spent most of his career in Japan. He is the author of ''[[Tokyo Vice|Tokyo Vice: An American Reporter on the Police Beat in Japan.]]''

==Career==
Adelstein grew up in [[Missouri]] and moved to [[Japan]] at age 19 to study Japanese literature at [[Sophia University]].&lt;ref name=Hessler&gt;Hessler, Peter. "All Due Respect" [http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2012/01/09/120109fa_fact_hessler Profile], ''[[The New Yorker]]'', January 9, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1993, Adelstein became the first non-Japanese staff writer at the ''[[Yomiuri Shinbun]]'' newspaper, where he worked for 12 years.&lt;ref name="ABC"&gt;Mark Willacy, [http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2009/10/20/2718773.htm "Exposing Japan's Insidious Underbelly"], [[ABC News (Australia)|ABC News]], October 20, 2009; accessed November 20, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

After leaving the ''Yomiuri'', Adelstein published an exposé of how an alleged crime boss, [[Tadamasa Goto]], made a deal with the FBI to gain entry to the United States for a liver transplant at the [[University of California Los Angeles]] (UCLA). In 2009, Adelstein published a memoir about his career as a reporter in Japan, ''[[Tokyo Vice]]'', in which he accused Goto of threatening to kill him over the story. &lt;ref name="adelstein post"&gt;Jake Adelstein, [https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/05/09/AR2008050902544.html "This Mob Is Big in Japan"], ''[[The Washington Post]]'', May 11, 2008, Accessed November 20, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

Adelstein was subsequently a reporter for a [[United States Department of State]] investigation into [[human trafficking]] in Japan, and now writes for the ''[[Daily Beast]]'', ''[[Vice News]]'', ''[[The Japan Times]]'' and other publications. He is a board member and advisor to the [[Lighthouse: Center for Human Trafficking Victims]] (formerly Polaris Project Japan).

On April 19, 2011, Adelstein filed a lawsuit against [[National Geographic Television]], which had hired him to help make a documentary about the yakuza, citing ethical problems with their behavior in Japan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| author = Eriq Gardner| title = NatGeo Delays Japanese Mafia Show at Center of Lawsuit (Updated)| quote =| newspaper =[[The Hollywood Reporter]]| date = May 10, 2011 | url =http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/thr-esq/natgeo-delays-japanese-mafia-show-187052| accessdate =August 1, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Superior&gt;Superior Court of the District of Columbia.

[[General]] '''Sir James Handyside Marshall-Cornwall''' [[Order of the Bath|KCB]], [[Order of the British Empire|CBE]], [[Distinguished Service Order|DSO]], [[Military Cross|MC]] (27 May 1887 – 25 December 1985) was a British Army officer and linguist.

==Early life==
James Cornwall was born in India, only son of James Cornwall, the Postmaster General of [[United Provinces of Agra and Oudh|United Provinces]] and his wife, Agnes Hunter.{{cn|date=April 2016}}

==Education==
Cornwall went to [[Rugby School]] and the [[Royal Military Academy, Woolwich]]. Commissioned into the [[Royal Field Artillery]] in 1907, during his first spell of annual leave he travelled to Germany to study German. He later passed the Civil Service Commission examination as a first-class German interpreter, the first of the eleven interpreterships he was to gain. He passed as first-class interpreter in French, Norwegian, Swedish, Hollander Dutch, and Italian.

==Military career==
On the outbreak of [[World War I]] Cornwall joined the [[Intelligence Corps (United Kingdom)|Intelligence Corps]] at [[Le Havre]]. In 1915 he was appointed to the rank of Captain at 2nd corps headquarters in the [[Second Army (United Kingdom)#World War I|Second Army]]. In 1916 he was promoted to temporary major at the general headquarters of the [[British Expeditionary Force (World War I)|British Expeditionary Force]] (BEF), under [[Douglas Haig, 1st Earl Haig|Sir Douglas Haig]]. In 1918, Cornwall was posted to the [[War Office]] as head of the [[MI3]] section of the military intelligence directorate, where he remained until the armistice.

He was decorated with the [[Military Cross]] in 1915,&lt;ref&gt;''The Edinburgh Gazette'' (23 February 1915), p. 307.&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Distinguished Service Order]] and the French [[Legion of Honour|''Legion d'Honneur'']], both in 1917,&lt;ref&gt;''The Edinburgh Gazette'' (4 June 1917), p. 1061 and (5 June 1917), p. 1093.&lt;/ref&gt; the Belgian [[Order of the Crown (Belgium)|''Ordre de la Couronne'']] and [[War Cross (Belgium)|''Croix de Guerre'']] in 1918&lt;ref&gt;''The Edinburgh Gazette'' (15 March 1918), p. 1022.&lt;/ref&gt; and the American [[Distinguished Service Medal (U.S. Army)|Distinguished Service Medal]] in 1919.&lt;ref&gt;''The Edinburgh Gazette'' (18 July 1919), p. 2427.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1919, after attending the first postwar course at the [[Staff College, Camberley]],&lt;ref&gt;Smart, p. 210&lt;/ref&gt; Cornwall was sent to the [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919|peace conference]] in [[Paris]], where he worked with [[Reginald Leeper]] and [[Harold Nicolson]] on the new boundaries of Europe. Several jobs in the Middle East in the 1920s gave him the opportunity to study Turkish and modern Greek.

In 1927, Cornwall was sent to China with the [[Royal Artillery]] ([[Shanghai Defence Force]]), to protect British life and property in the [[Shanghai International Settlement]]. This enabled him to learn Chinese and to travel extensively in the Far East with his wife.

From 1928 to 1932 he held the post of military attaché in [[Berlin]].&lt;ref name=dk&gt;[http://www.generals.dk/general/Marshall-Cornwall/Sir_James_Handyside/Great_Britain.html Generals.dk]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1934, after two years as commander of the 51st Highland division,&lt;ref name=dk/&gt; Royal Artillery, based at Perth, Scotland, Marshall-Cornwall was promoted major-general. He spent the next four years travelling in Europe, India, and the United States, then two years in Cairo as head of the British military mission to [[Egypt]].&lt;ref name=dk/&gt; Here he qualified as an interpreter in colloquial Arabic.

In 1938, he was promoted to lieutenant-general, in charge of the air defence of Great Britain.&lt;ref name=dk/&gt; In May 1940 he went to France to help evacuate British troops from Cherbourg, boarding the last ship to leave the port. He took over command of [[III Corps (United Kingdom)|III Corps]] in England in June 1940 holding the post until November 1940.&lt;ref name=dk/&gt;

In April 1941 Marshall-Cornwall became [[General Officer Commanding]] the [[Egypt Command|British troops in Egypt]].&lt;ref name=dk/&gt; Later that year he was sent by [[Winston Churchill]] to Turkey in an attempt to persuade the Turks to join the war, a mission which failed.&lt;ref name=dk/&gt;

==Personal life==
Cornwall met Marjorie Coralie Scott Owen, who was driving an ambulance for a Red Cross mission to [[White movement|White Russia]]n refugees, while encamped in the [[Izmit]] peninsula. They were married in Wales in April 1921. In 1927 he inherited a small estate in Scotland from his uncle William Marshall, on condition that he should assume the surname of Marshall. As Marshall was one of his forenames, this was achieved by the insertion of a hyphen. The Marshall-Cornwalls had a son and two daughters. Their elder daughter died aged fourteen in 1938 after an operation for appendicitis in Switzerland. Their son was killed in France in 1944. He is buried on the spot where he fell, in an orchard near Cahaignes, Normandy. After the war, the landowner presented the site of the grave to the casualty's father, who in turn, requested that the grave remain undisturbed. His other daughter Janet married [[Michael Willoughby, 12th Baron Middleton]] on 14 October 1947.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Person Page - 4655|publisher=thePeerage.com|url=http://www.thepeerage.com/p4655.htm#i46546|accessdate=2 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to critic [[Jancy James]], "In the entire history of women's writing in Kerala, Saraswathi Amma's is the most tragic case of the deliberate neglect of female genius."&lt;ref name="deepubalan"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://samyukta.info/site/node/57|title=K.

==Literary career==

K. Saraswathy Amma made her entry into the Malayalam literary scenario with a short story published in 1938, which was followed by 12 volumes of short stories, one novel, a play, and in 1958, a book of essays titled [[Purushanmarillatha Lokam]].&lt;ref name="deepubalan"/&gt; In her time she was marginalized as a 'man hater'. But current feminist scholars have celebrated her as a genius.&lt;ref name="deepubalan"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Devika&gt;{{cite journal | last = Devika | first = J. | author-link = J.

[[J. Devika]] in her article titled 'Beyond Kulina and Kulata: The Critique of Gender Difference in the Writings of K. Saraswati Amma', in [[Indian Journal of Gender Studies]] re-reads the writings of K. Saraswati Amma, whom she describes "an author marginalised within the Malayalee literary universe and labelled as an incorrigible man-hater." She considers her paper an "effort to read her writing as an engagement with the positions taken in the debates around modern gender in the early 20th-century Malayalee public sphere."&lt;ref name=Devika /&gt;

A selection of Saraswathi Amma's fiction, some of it translated into English were published in the name [[Stories from a forgotten feminist]].&lt;ref name="fishpond.com.au"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fishpond.com.au/Books/Stories-from-Forgotten-Feminist-Jancy-James-Introduction-by-K-Saraswaiti-Amma/9788185107622|title=Stories from a Forgotten Feminist, Jancy James (Introduction ) K Saraswaiti Amma - Shop Online for Books in Australia|work=fishpond.com.au}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/Stories-Forgotten-Feminist-Saraswaiti-Amma/dp/8185107629/ref=sr_1_1/189-0870180-3462954?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1383982572&amp;sr=1-1|title=Stories from a Forgotten Feminist: K.

Keel depth is useful for determining safe operating depth in shallow water.

The '''Khoe languages''' are the largest of the non-[[Bantu languages|Bantu]] [[language family|language families]] indigenous to southern Africa. They were once considered to be a branch of a [[Khoisan languages|Khoisan]] language family, and were known as '''Central Khoisan''' in that scenario. Though Khoisan is now rejected as a family, the name is retained as a term of convenience.

The most numerous and only well known Khoe language is [[Nama language|Nama]] of [[Namibia]], also known as Khoekhoegowab or Hottentot. The rest of the family is found predominantly in the [[Kalahari Desert]] of [[Botswana]].

The Khoe languages were the first Khoisan languages known to European colonists and are famous for their [[click consonant|clicks]], though these are not as extensive as in other Khoisan language families. There are two primary branches of the family, ''Khoekhoe'' of Namibia and South Africa, and ''Tshu–Khwe'' of Botswana and [[Zimbabwe]]. Except for Nama, they are under pressure from national or regional languages such as [[Tswana language|Tswana]].

==History==
Tom Güldemann believes agro-pastoralist people speaking the [[Khoe–Kwadi]] proto-language entered modern-day Botswana about 2000 years ago from the northeast (that is, from the direction of the modern Sandawe), where they had likely acquired agriculture from the expanding [[Bantu peoples|Bantu]], at a time when the Kalahari was more amenable to agriculture. The ancestors of the [[Kwadi people|Kwadi]] (and perhaps the [[Damara people|Damara]]) continued west, whereas those who settled in the Kalahari absorbed speakers of [[Juu languages]]. Thus the Khoe family proper has a Juu influence. These immigrants were ancestral to the north-eastern Kalahari peoples (Eastern Tshu–Khwe branch linguistically), whereas Juu neighbours (or perhaps [[Kx'a languages|Kx'a]] neighbours more generally) to the southwest who shifted to Khoe were ancestral to the Western Tshu–Khwe branch.

Later desiccation of the Kalahari led to the adoption of a [[hunter-gatherer]] economy and preserved the Kalahari peoples from absorption by the agricultural Bantu when they spread south.

Those Khoe who continued southwestwards retained pastoralism and became the [[Khoekhoe people|Khoekhoe]]. They mixed extensively with speakers of [[Tuu languages]], absorbing features of their languages. The expansion of the [[Nama people]] into Namibia and their absorption of client peoples such as the Damara and [[Haiǁom people|Haiǁom]] took place in the 16th century and later, at about the time of European contact and colonization.

==Classification==
The nearest relative of the Khoe family may be the extinct [[Kwadi language]] of [[Angola]]. This larger group, for which pronouns and some basic vocabulary have been reconstructed, is called '''Kwadi–Khoe'''. However, because Kwadi is poorly attested, it is difficult to tell which common words are cognate and which might be loans.  Beyond that, the nearest relative may be the [[Sandawe language|Sandawe]] isolate; the Sandawe pronoun system is very similar to that of Kwadi–Khoe, but there are not enough known correlations for regular sound correspondences to be worked out. However, the relationship has some predictive value, for example if the [[back-vowel constraint]], which operates in the Khoe languages but not in Sandawe, is taken into account.

Language classifications may list one or two dozen Khoe languages. Because many are [[dialect cluster]]s, there is a level of subjectivity involved in separating them. Counting each dialect cluster as a unit results in nine Khoe languages:

*[[Nama language|Nama]] (ethnonyms Khoekhoe, Nama, [[Damara (people)|Damara]]) is a dialect cluster including ǂAakhoe and [[Haiǁom people|Haiǁom]]
*[[Xiri language|Xiri]] is a dialect cluster also known as Griqua ([[Afrikaans language|Afrikaans]] spelling) or Cape Hottentot.

{{anchor|Unidentified}}Dozens of names are associated with the Tshu–Khwe languages, especially with the Eastern cluster.  These may be place, clan or totem names, often without any linguistically identifiable data. Examples include ''Masasi, Badza, Didi,'' and ''Dzhiki''.&lt;ref&gt;E. O. J. Westphal, "The Linguistic Prehistory of Southern Africa: Bush, Kwadi, Hottentot, and Bantu Linguistic Relationships", ''Africa: Journal of the International African Institute'', vol. 33, no. 3 (Jul. 1963), pp. 237–265.&lt;/ref&gt; It is not presently possible to say which languages correspond to which names mentioned in the anthropological literature, though the majority will likely turn out to be Shua or Tshua.&lt;ref&gt;Yvonne Treis, "Names of Khoisan Languages and their Variants"&lt;/ref&gt;

In most of the Eastern Kalahari Khoe languages, the alveolar and palatal clicks have been lost, or are in the process of being lost.  For example, the northern dialect of [[Kua language|Kua]] has lost palatal clicks, but the southern dialect retains them.  In [[Ts'ixa language|Ts'ixa]], the change has created [[doublet (linguistics)|doublet]]s with palatal clicks vs palatal plosives.

The nearest relative of the Khoe family may be the extinct [[Kwadi language]] of [[Angola]]. This larger group, for which pronouns and some basic vocabulary have been reconstructed, is called '''[[Khoe–Kwadi]]'''.

'''''Knowledge of Language: Its Nature, Origin, and Use''''' is a book by American linguist [[Noam Chomsky]], first published in 1986. In this book, Chomsky deals with topics in the [[philosophy of language]] and the [[philosophy of mind]]. He argues that the study of linguistic structures provides insight into the workings of human mind.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6461">The '''Leipzig–Jakarta list''' is a 100-word list of words used by [[linguistics|linguists]] to test the degree of chronological separation of [[language]]s by comparing words that are resistant to [[loan word|borrowing]]. The Leipzig–Jakarta list became available in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;"Linguistic Fieldwork: A Student Guide" by J. Sakel and D. L. Everett&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1950s, the linguist [[Morris Swadesh]] published a list of 200 words called the [[Swadesh list]], allegedly the 200 lexical concepts found in all languages that were least likely to be borrowed from other languages. Swadesh later whittled his list down to 100 items. The Swadesh list, however, was based mainly on intuition, according to [[Martin Haspelmath]] and [[Uri Tadmor]].&lt;ref&gt;Haspelmath, p. 72&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Loanword Typology Project]], with the [[World Loanword Database]] (WOLD), published by the Max Planck Digital Library, was established to rectify this problem. Experts on 41 languages from across the world were given a uniform vocabulary list and asked to provide the words for each item in the language on which they were an expert, as well as information on how strong the evidence that each word was borrowed was.&lt;ref&gt;http://wold.clld.org/&lt;/ref&gt; The 100 concepts that were found in most languages and were most resistant to borrowing formed the Leipzig–Jakarta list. Only 62 items on the Leipzig–Jakarta list and on the 100-word Swadesh list overlap, hence a 38% difference between the two lists.

25% of the words in the Leipzig–Jakarta list are body parts: ''[[mouth]]'', ''[[eye]]'', ''[[leg]]''/''foot'', ''[[navel]]'', ''[[liver]]'', ''[[knee]]'', etc.&lt;ref&gt;Haspelmath, p. 71&lt;/ref&gt; Six animal words appear on the list: ''[[fish]]'', ''[[bird]]'', ''[[dog]]'', ''[[louse]]'', ''[[ant]]'' and ''[[fly (insect)|fly]]'' – animals found everywhere [[human]]s can be found.&lt;ref&gt;Haspelmath, p. 72&lt;/ref&gt;

The items ''[[house]]'', ''[[name]]'', ''[[rope]]'' and ''[[Knot tying|to tie]]'' are products of human culture, but are probably found in all present-day human societies. Haspelmath and Tadmor drew the conclusion that "rope is the most basic of human tools and tying is the most basic technology".&lt;ref&gt;Haspelmath, p. 72&lt;/ref&gt;

'''MUSA (MUltichannel Speaking Automaton)''' was an early prototype of [[Speech Synthesis]] machine started in [[1975]].

== Description ==
It consisted of a stand-alone computer hardware and a specialized software that implemented a [[diphone]]-synthesis technology. It was able to read italian in intellegibile robotic voice and also to sing managing up to 8 synthesis channels in parallel. In 1978 it was released, after the building of a working prototype&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/016763939500030R Billi, R., Canavesio, F., Ciaramella, A., &amp; Nebbia, L. (1995). Interactive voice technology at work: The CSELT experience. Speech communication, 17(3-4), 263-271. ]&lt;/ref&gt;, an [[45-rpm record|45" rpm audio disk]] containing some trial content of such synthesis, including the song "[[Frère Jacques|Fra Martino Campanaro]]" in "[[a cappella]]" (multiple voices) style, attached to some commercial reviews&lt;ref&gt;(it) Cantoni, Virginio, Gabriele Falciasecca, and Giuseppe Pelosi, eds. Storia delle telecomunicazioni. Vol. 1. Firenze university press, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;. The experiment was conducted by [[CSELT]], [[Turin]], [[Italy]] and was led by [[Giulio Modena]].

Born and raised in a [[Hindu]] [[Bania (caste)|merchant caste]] family in coastal [[Gujarat]], [[India]], and trained in law at the [[Inner Temple]], London, Gandhi first employed nonviolent civil disobedience as an expatriate lawyer in South Africa, in the resident Indian community's struggle for civil rights. After his return to India in 1915, he set about organising peasants, farmers, and urban labourers to protest against excessive land-tax and discrimination. Assuming leadership of the [[Indian National Congress]] in 1921, Gandhi led nationwide campaigns for various social causes and for achieving ''[[Swaraj]]'' or self-rule.

Gandhi led Indians in challenging the British-imposed salt tax with the {{convert|400|km|mi|abbr=on}} [[Salt March|Dandi Salt March]] in 1930, and later in calling for the British to ''[[Quit India Movement|Quit India]]'' in 1942. He was imprisoned for many years, upon many occasions, in both South Africa and India. He lived modestly in a [[Sabarmati Ashram|self-sufficient residential community]] and wore the traditional Indian ''[[dhoti]]'' and shawl, woven with yarn hand-spun on a ''[[Spinning wheel#Charkha|charkha]]''. He ate simple vegetarian food, and also [[List of fasts undertaken by Mahatma Gandhi|undertook long fasts]] as a means of both self-purification and political protest.

Gandhi's vision of an independent India based on [[religious pluralism]], however, was challenged in the early 1940s by a new Muslim nationalism which was demanding a separate Muslim homeland carved out of India.&lt;ref name=Khan2007-page1&gt;{{Cite book|last=Khan|first=Yasmin|title=The Great Partition: The Making of India and Pakistan|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=i9WdQp2pwOYC&amp;pg=PA18|access-date=1 September 2013|year=2007|publisher=Yale University Press|isbn=978-0-300-12078-3|page=18|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131012210526/http://books.google.com/books?id=i9WdQp2pwOYC&amp;pg=PA18|archivedate=12 October 2013|df=dmy-all}} Quote: "the Muslim League had only caught on among South Asian Muslims during the Second World War. ...

They heard about it on the radio, from relations and friends, by reading newspapers and, later, through government pamphlets. Among a population of almost four hundred million, where the vast majority lived in the countryside, ..., it is hardly surprising that many ... did not hear the news for many weeks afterwards. For some, the butchery and forced relocation of the summer months of 1947 may have been the first they know about the creation of the two new states rising from the fragmentary and terminally weakened British empire in India." (p. 1)&lt;/ref&gt; As many displaced Hindus, Muslims, and [[Sikh]]s made their way to their new lands, religious violence broke out, especially in the [[Punjab region|Punjab]] and [[Bengal]]. Eschewing the [[Independence Day (India)|official celebration of independence]] in Delhi, Gandhi visited the affected areas, attempting to provide solace.

His decision was made suddenly, though after considerable thought – he gave no hint of it even to Nehru and Patel who were with him shortly before he announced his intention at a prayer-meeting on 12 January 1948. He said he would fast until communal peace was restored, real peace rather than the calm of a dead city imposed by police and troops.

His father, [[Karamchand Uttamchand Gandhi]] (1822–1885), served as the ''[[Dewan|diwan]]'' (chief minister) of Porbandar state.&lt;ref&gt;Mohandas K. Gandhi, ''Autobiography'' chapter 1 (Dover edition, p. 1).&lt;/ref&gt;

Although he only had an elementary education and had previously been a clerk in the state administration, Karamchand proved a capable chief minister.&lt;ref name=GuhaPP19to21&gt;Guha 2015 pp. 19–21&lt;/ref&gt; During his tenure, Karamchand married four times. His first two wives died young, after each had given birth to a daughter, and his third marriage was childless. In 1857, Karamchand sought his third wife's permission to remarry; that year, he married Putlibai (1844–1891), who also came from Junagadh,&lt;ref name=GuhaPP19to21/&gt; and was from a [[Pranami]] [[Vaishnavism|Vaishnava]] family.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Identity and Religion: Foundations of anti-Islamism in India|year=2004|page=67|url=https://books.google.com/?id=aLgB8pZg0qsC&amp;pg=PA67|isbn=9780761932277|author=Misra, Amalendu}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Mohandas: A True Story of a Man, His People, and an Empire By Gandhi|year=2006|page=5|url=https://books.google.com/?id=TEyXCoc76AEC&amp;pg=PA5|isbn=9780143104117|author=Gandhi, Rajmohan}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Tendulkar1951"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Lawyer to Mahatma: Life, Work and Transformation of M.

On 2 October 1869, Putlibai gave birth to her last child, Mohandas, in a dark, windowless ground-floor room of the Gandhi family residence in Porbandar city. As a child, Gandhi was described by his sister Raliat as "restless as mercury, either playing or roaming about. One of his favourite pastimes was twisting dogs' ears."&lt;ref&gt;Guha 2015, p. 22&lt;/ref&gt; The Indian classics, especially the stories of [[Shravan#In Hindu epics|Shravana]] and king [[Harishchandra]], had a great impact on Gandhi in his childhood. In his autobiography, he admits that they left an indelible impression on his mind. He writes: "It haunted me and I must have acted Harishchandra to myself times without number." Gandhi's early self-identification with truth and love as supreme values is traceable to these epic characters.&lt;ref name="Sorokin2002"/&gt;&lt;ref name="RudolphRudolph1983"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Rudolph, Susanne Hoeber  |author2=Rudolph, Lloyd I.  |lastauthoramp=yes |title=Gandhi: The Traditional Roots of Charisma|url=https://books.google.com/?id=JsPYNLAU9KYC&amp;pg=PA48|year=1983|publisher=University of Chicago Press|page=48|isbn=9780226731360}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The family's religious background was eclectic. Gandhi's father Karamchand was [[Hindu]] and his mother Putlibai was from a Pranami [[Vaishnava]] Hindu family.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Rajmohan|Gandhi, Rajmohan (2006)]] pp. 2, 8, 269&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=sharma11&gt;{{cite book|author=Arvind Sharma|title=Gandhi: A Spiritual Biography|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2xFGsj4PIjoC |year=2013|publisher=Yale University Press|isbn=978-0-300-18738-0|pages=11–14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gandhi's father was of Modh Baniya caste in the [[Varna (Hinduism)|varna]] of [[Vaishya]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Rudolph, Susanne Hoeber  |author2=Rudolph, Lloyd I.  |lastauthoramp=yes |title=Gandhi: The Traditional Roots of Charisma|url=https://books.google.com/?id=JsPYNLAU9KYC&amp;pg=PA17|year=1983|publisher=University of Chicago Press|page=17|isbn=9780226731360}}&lt;/ref&gt; His mother came from the medieval [[Krishna]] bhakti-based [[Pranami]] tradition, whose religious texts include the ''[[Bhagavad Gita]]'', the ''[[Bhagavata Purana]]'', and a collection of 14 texts with teachings that the tradition believes to include the essence of the [[Vedas]], the [[Quran]] and the [[Bible]].&lt;ref name=sharma11/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Gerard Toffin|editor=John Zavos et al|title=Public Hinduisms|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uuuICwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT249| year=2012|publisher= SAGE Publications|isbn=978-81-321-1696-7|pages=249–257}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gandhi was deeply influenced by his mother, an extremely pious lady who "would not think of taking her meals without her daily prayers...she would take the hardest vows and keep them without flinching. To keep two or three consecutive fasts was nothing to her."&lt;ref&gt;Guha 2015, p. 23&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1874, Gandhi's father Karamchand left Porbandar for the smaller state of Rajkot, where he became a counsellor to its ruler, the Thakur Sahib; though Rajkot was a less prestigious state than Porbandar, the British regional political agency was located there, which gave the state's ''diwan'' a measure of security.&lt;ref&gt;Guha 2015, pp. 24-25&lt;/ref&gt; In 1876, Karamchand became ''diwan'' of Rajkot and was succeeded as ''diwan'' of Porbandar by his brother Tulsidas. His family then rejoined him in Rajkot.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite book|title=Gandhi before India|year= 2015|author=Rajmohan Gandhi |publisher=Vintage Books|isbn=978-0-385-53230-3|pages=24–25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At age 9, Gandhi entered the local school in [[Rajkot]], near his home. There he studied the rudiments of arithmetic, history, the Gujarati language and geography.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; At age 11, he joined the High School in Rajkot.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;{{cite book|title=Gandhi before India|year= 2015|author=Rajmohan Gandhi | publisher=Vintage Books|isbn=978-0-385-53230-3|pages=25–26}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was an average student, won some prizes, but was a shy and tongue tied student, with no interest in games; his only companions were books and school lessons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Sankar Ghose|title=Mahatma Gandhi|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5l0BPnxN1h8C&amp;pg=PA4|year=1991|publisher=Allied Publishers|isbn=978-81-7023-205-6|page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While at high school, Gandhi's elder brother introduced him to a Muslim friend named Sheikh Mehtab. Mehtab was older in age, taller and encouraged the strictly vegetarian boy to eat meat to gain height. He also took Mohandas to a brothel one day, though Mohandas "was struck blind and dumb in this den of vice," rebuffed the prostitutes' advances and was promptly sent out of the brothel. The experience caused Mohandas mental anguish, and he abandoned the company of Mehtab.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Ramachandra Guha| title=Gandhi before India |year=2015| publisher=Vintage Books|isbn=978-0-385-53230-3|pages=27–28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 1883, the 13-year-old Mohandas was married to 14-year-old [[Kasturba Gandhi|Kasturbai Makhanji Kapadia]] (her first name was usually shortened to "Kasturba", and affectionately to "Ba") in an [[arranged marriage|arranged]] marriage, according to the custom of the region at that time.&lt;ref name="Mohanty2011"/&gt; In the process, he lost a year at school, but was later allowed to make up by accelerating his studies.&lt;ref name="Childhood"&gt;Gandhi (1940).

Recalling the day of their marriage, he once said, "As we didn't know much about marriage, for us it meant only wearing new clothes, eating sweets and playing with relatives." However, as was prevailing tradition, the adolescent bride was to spend much time at her parents' house, and away from her husband.&lt;ref name="Husband"&gt;Gandhi (1940).

He later recalled feeling jealous and possessive of her, such as when she would visit a temple with her girlfriends, and being sexually lustful in his feelings for her.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Ramachandra Guha |title=Gandhi before India |year= 2015| publisher= Vintage Books|isbn=978-0-385-53230-3|pages=28–29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In late 1885, Gandhi's father Karamchand died.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"&gt;Guha 2015, p. 29&lt;/ref&gt; Gandhi, then 16 years old, and his wife of age 17 had their first baby, who survived only a few days. The two deaths anguished Gandhi.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt; The Gandhi couple had four more children, all sons: [[Harilal Gandhi|Harilal]], born in 1888; [[Manilal Gandhi|Manilal]], born in 1892; [[Ramdas Gandhi|Ramdas]], born in 1897; and [[Devdas Gandhi|Devdas]], born in 1900.&lt;ref name="Mohanty2011"/&gt;

In November 1887, the 18-year-old Gandhi graduated from high school in [[Ahmedabad]].&lt;ref&gt;Guha 2015, p. 30&lt;/ref&gt; In January 1888, he enrolled at Samaldas College in [[Bhavnagar State]], then the sole degree-granting institution of higher education in the region. But he dropped out and returned to his family in Porbandar.&lt;ref name="autogenerated32"&gt;Guha 2015, p. 32&lt;/ref&gt;

Gandhi's uncle Tulsidas also tried to dissuade his nephew. Gandhi wanted to go. To persuade his wife and mother, Gandhi made a vow in front of his mother that he would abstain from meat, alcohol and women. Gandhi's brother Laxmidas, who was already a lawyer, cheered Gandhi's London studies plan and offered to support him. Putlibai gave Gandhi her permission and blessing.&lt;ref name="autogenerated32"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Gandhi2006a"&gt;[[#Rajmohan|Gandhi, Rajmohan (2006)]] [https://books.google.com/?id=FauJL7LKXmkC&amp;pg=PA20 pp. 20–21].&lt;/ref&gt;

On 10 August 1888, Gandhi aged 18, left Porbandar for Mumbai, then known as Bombay. Upon arrival, he stayed with the local Modh Bania community while waiting for the ship travel arrangements. The head of the community knew Gandhi's father. After learning Gandhi's plans, he and other elders warned Gandhi that England would tempt him to compromise his religion, and eat and drink in Western ways. Gandhi informed them of his promise to his mother and her blessings. The local chief disregarded it, and excommunicated him an outcast. But Gandhi ignored this, and on 4 September, he sailed from Bombay to London. His brother saw him off.&lt;ref name="autogenerated33"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;M K Gandhi (1940), [https://wikilivres.ca/wiki/The_Story_of_My_Experiments_with_Truth/Part_I/Outcaste The Story of My Experiments with Truth] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160417030706/http://wikilivres.ca/wiki/The_Story_of_My_Experiments_with_Truth/Part_I/Outcaste |date=17 April 2016 }}, Autobiography, Wikisource&lt;/ref&gt;
Gandhi attended University College, London which is a constituent college of University of London.
[[File:Gandhi student.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.85|Gandhi in London as a law student]] At UCL, he studied law and [[jurisprudence]] and was invited to enroll at [[Inner Temple]] with the intention of becoming a [[barrister]]. His childhood shyness and self withdrawal had continued through his teens, and he remained so when he arrived in London, but he joined a public speaking practice group and overcame this handicap to practise law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Thomas Weber|title=Gandhi as Disciple and Mentor|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=P8nC80pG4GIC&amp;pg=PA19|year=2004|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-1-139-45657-9|pages=19–25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His time in London was influenced by the vow he had made to his mother. He tried to adopt "English" customs, including taking dancing lessons. However, he could not appreciate the bland vegetarian food offered by his landlady and was frequently hungry until he found one of London's few vegetarian restaurants. Influenced by [[Henry Stephens Salt|Henry Salt's]] writing, he joined the [[Vegetarian Society]], was elected to its executive committee,&lt;ref name="Brown1991"&gt;[[#Brown1991|Brown (1991)]].&lt;/ref&gt; and started a local [[Bayswater]] chapter.&lt;ref name="Tendulkar1951" /&gt; Some of the vegetarians he met were members of the [[Theosophical Society]], which had been founded in 1875 to further universal brotherhood, and which was devoted to the study of [[Buddhist]] and [[Hindu]] literature. They encouraged Gandhi to join them in reading the ''[[Bhagavad Gita]]'' both in translation as well as in the original.&lt;ref name="Brown1991"/&gt;

Gandhi, at age 22, was [[Call to the bar|called to the bar]] in June 1891 and then left London for India, where he learned that his mother had died while he was in London and that his family had kept the news from him.&lt;ref name="Brown1991"/&gt; His attempts at establishing a law practice in [[Bombay]] failed because he was psychologically unable to [[cross-examination|cross-examine]] witnesses. He returned to Rajkot to make a modest living drafting petitions for litigants, but he was forced to stop when he ran afoul of a British officer.&lt;ref name="Tendulkar1951"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Brown1991"/&gt; In 1893, a Muslim merchant in Kathiawar named Dada Abdullah contacted Gandhi. Abdullah owned a large successful shipping business in South Africa. His distant cousin in Johannesburg needed a lawyer, and they preferred someone with Kathiawari heritage. Gandhi inquired about his pay for the work. They offered a total salary of £105 plus travel expenses. He accepted it, knowing that it would be at least one-year commitment in the [[Colony of Natal]], South Africa, also a part of the British Empire.&lt;ref name="Tendulkar1951"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Herman 2008 pp. 82"&gt;[[#Herman2008|Herman (2008)]], pp. 82–83&lt;/ref&gt;

===Civil rights activist in South Africa (1893–1914)===

In April 1893, Gandhi aged 23, set sail for South Africa to be the lawyer for Abdullah's cousin.&lt;ref name="Herman 2008 pp. 82"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NHOA-193"&gt;{{cite book|author1=[[Giliomee, Hermann]]  |author2=[[Mbenga, Bernard]]  |lastauthoramp=yes |title=New History of South Africa|editor=Roxanne Reid|publisher= Tafelberg|year=2007|edition=1st|page=193|chapter=3|isbn=978-0-624-04359-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; He spent 21 years in South Africa, where he developed his political views, ethics and politics.&lt;ref name="Gandhi"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Gandhi in South Africa|journal= [[The Journal of Modern African Studies]]|year= 1969|jstor=159062|author=Power, Paul F. |volume=7|issue=3|pages=441–55|doi=10.1017/S0022278X00018590}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Immediately upon arriving in South Africa, Gandhi faced discrimination because of his skin colour and heritage, like all people of colour.&lt;ref name="Parekh2001"/&gt; He was not allowed to sit with European passengers in the stagecoach and told to sit on the floor near the driver, then beaten when he refused; elsewhere he was kicked into a gutter for daring to walk near a house, in another instance thrown off a train at [[Pietermaritzburg]] after refusing to leave the first-class.&lt;ref name="Stagecoach"&gt;Gandhi (1940).

When Gandhi arrived in South Africa, according to Herman, he thought of himself as "a Briton first, and an Indian second".&lt;ref&gt;[[#Herman2008|Herman (2008)]], pp. 87–88&lt;/ref&gt; However, the prejudice against him and his fellow Indians from British people that Gandhi experienced and observed deeply bothered him. He found it humiliating, struggling to understand how some people can feel honour or superiority or pleasure in such inhumane practices.&lt;ref name=dhiman25/&gt; Gandhi began to question his people's standing in the [[British Empire]].&lt;ref name="Allen2011"&gt;{{cite book|last=Allen|first=Jeremiah|title=Sleeping with Strangers: A Vagabond's Journey Tramping the Globe|url=https://books.google.com/?id=vyl8f54UToQC&amp;pg=PT273|year=2011|publisher=Other Places Publishing|isbn=978-1-935850-01-4|page=273}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Abdullah case that had brought him to South Africa concluded in May 1894, and the Indian community organised a farewell party for Gandhi as he prepared to return to India.&lt;ref name="Herman 2008 pp. 88"&gt;[[#Herman2008|Herman (2008)]], pp. 88–89&lt;/ref&gt; However, a new Natal government discriminatory proposal led to Gandhi extending his original period of stay in South Africa. He planned to assist Indians in opposing a bill to [[Disfranchisement|deny them the right to vote]], a right then proposed to be an exclusive European right. He asked [[Joseph Chamberlain]], the British Colonial Secretary, to reconsider his position on this bill.&lt;ref name="Gandhi" /&gt; Though unable to halt the bill's passage, his campaign was successful in drawing attention to the grievances of Indians in South Africa. He helped found the [[Natal Indian Congress]] in 1894,&lt;ref name="Tendulkar1951"/&gt;&lt;ref name="(Mahatma)Fischer2002"/&gt; and through this organisation, he moulded the Indian community of South Africa into a unified political force. In January 1897, when Gandhi landed in Durban, a mob of white settlers attacked him&lt;ref&gt;{{cite wikisource|title=The Collected Works of Mahatma Gandhi|chapter=March 1897 Memorial|wslink=The_Collected_Works_of_Mahatma_Gandhi/Volume_II}}: correspondence and newspaper accounts of the incident.&lt;/ref&gt; and he escaped only through the efforts of the wife of the police superintendent. However, he refused to press charges against any member of the mob.&lt;ref name="Tendulkar1951"/&gt;

[[File:Gandhi Boer War.jpg|thumb|left|Gandhi with the stretcher-bearers of the [[Indian Ambulance Corps]]]]
During the [[Second Boer War|Boer War]], Gandhi volunteered in 1900 to form a group of stretcher-bearers as the [[Natal Indian Ambulance Corps]]. According to Arthur Herman, Gandhi wanted to disprove the imperial British stereotype that Hindus were not fit for "manly" activities involving danger and exertion, unlike the Muslim "martial races".&lt;ref&gt;[[#Herman2008|Herman (2008)]], page 125&lt;/ref&gt; Gandhi raised eleven hundred Indian volunteers, to support British combat troops against the Boers. They were trained and medically certified to serve on the front lines. They were auxiliaries at the [[Battle of Colenso]] to a White volunteer ambulance corps; then at [[Battle of Spion Kop|Spion Kop]] Gandhi and his bearers moved to the front line and had to carry wounded soldiers for miles to a field hospital because the terrain was too rough for the ambulances. Gandhi and thirty-seven other Indians received the [[Queen's South Africa Medal]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Herman2008|Herman (2008)]] chapter 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Gandhi and Kasturbhai 1902.jpg|thumb|Gandhi and his wife [[Kasturba Gandhi|Kasturba]] (1902)]]
In 1906, the [[Transvaal Colony|Transvaal]] government promulgated a new Act compelling registration of the colony's Indian and Chinese populations. At a mass protest meeting held in Johannesburg on 11 September that year, Gandhi adopted his still evolving methodology of ''[[Satyagraha]]'' (devotion to the truth), or nonviolent protest, for the first time.&lt;ref name="Rai2000"&gt;{{cite book|last=Rai|first=Ajay Shanker|title=Gandhian Satyagraha: An Analytical And Critical Approach|url=https://books.google.com/?id=Z9ZSLa6cy-8C&amp;pg=PA35|year=2000|publisher=Concept Publishing Company|isbn=978-81-7022-799-1|page=35}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Anthony Parel, Gandhi was also influenced by the Tamil text ''[[Tirukkuṛaḷ]]'' because [[Leo Tolstoy]] mentioned it in their correspondence that began with "[[A Letter to a Hindu]]".&lt;ref name="LetterToAHindu"&gt;{{cite web

====Europeans, Indians and Africans====
Gandhi focused his attention on Indians while in South Africa. He was not interested in politics. This changed after he was discriminated against and bullied, such as by being thrown out of a train coach because of his skin colour by a white train official. After several such incidents with [[White South African|Whites in South Africa]], Gandhi's thinking and focus changed, and he felt he must resist this and fight for rights. He entered politics by forming the Natal Indian Congress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1= Jones|first1= Constance|last2= Ryan|first2= James|title= Encyclopedia of Hinduism|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=OgMmceadQ3gC|access-date= 5 October 2012|year= 2009|publisher= Infobase Publishing|isbn= 978-1-4381-0873-5|pages= 158–59|deadurl= no|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20151021174237/https://books.google.com/books?id=OgMmceadQ3gC|archivedate= 21 October 2015|df= dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Ashwin Desai and Goolam Vahed, Gandhi's views on racism are contentious, and in some cases, distressing to those who admire him. Gandhi suffered persecution from the beginning in South Africa. Like with other coloured people, white officials denied him his rights, and the press and those in the streets bullied and called him a "parasite", "semi-barbarous", "canker", "squalid coolie", "yellow man", and other epithets. People would spit on him as an expression of racial hate.&lt;ref name="Desai2015p26"/&gt;

While in South Africa, Gandhi focused on racial persecution of Indians, but ignored those of Africans. In some cases, state Desai and Vahed, his behaviour was one of being a willing part of racial stereotyping and African exploitation.&lt;ref name="Desai2015p26"/&gt; During a speech in September 1896, Gandhi complained that the whites in the British colony of South Africa were degrading Indian Hindus and Muslims to "a level of [[Kaffir (racial term)|Kaffir]]". Scholars cite it as an example of evidence that Gandhi at that time thought of Indians and black South Africans differently.&lt;ref name="Desai2015p26"/&gt; As another example given by Herman, Gandhi, at age 24, prepared a legal brief for the Natal Assembly in 1895, seeking voting rights for Indians. Gandhi cited race history and European Orientalists' opinions that "Anglo-Saxons and Indians are sprung from the same Aryan stock or rather the Indo-European peoples", and argued that Indians should not be grouped with the Africans.&lt;ref name="Herman 2008 pp. 88"/&gt;

Years later, Gandhi and his colleagues served and helped Africans as nurses and by opposing racism, according to the Nobel Peace Prize winner [[Nelson Mandela]]. The general image of Gandhi, state Desai and Vahed, has been reinvented since his assassination as if he was always a saint, when in reality his life was more complex, contained inconvenient truths and was one that evolved over time.&lt;ref name="Desai2015p26"&gt;{{cite book|author1= Ashwin Desai|author2= Goolem Vahed|title=The South African Gandhi: Stretcher-Bearer of Empire|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=lZZ1CgAAQBAJ |year= 2015|publisher= Stanford University Press|isbn= 978-0-8047-9717-7 |pages= 22–26, 33–38}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, other Africa scholars state the evidence points to a rich history of co-operation and efforts by Gandhi and Indian people with nonwhite South Africans against persecution of Africans and the [[Apartheid]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Edward Ramsamy|author2=Michael Mbanaso|author3=Chima Korieh|title=Minorities and the State in Africa|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-J-EZLTRVRwC |publisher=Cambria Press|isbn=978-1-62196-874-0|pages=71–73}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1906, when the British [[Bambatha Rebellion|declared war]] against the [[Zulu Kingdom]] in Natal, Gandhi at age 36, sympathised with the Zulus, and encouraged the Indian volunteers to help as an ambulance unit.&lt;ref name="Herman2010"/&gt; He argued that Indians should participate in the war efforts to change attitudes and perceptions of the British people against the coloured people.&lt;ref name="Herman2010p281"&gt;[[#Herman2008|Herman (2008)]], pp. 280–281, 154–157&lt;/ref&gt; Gandhi, a group of 20 Indians and black people of South Africa volunteered as a stretcher-bearer corps to treat wounded British soldiers and the opposite side of the war: Zulu victims.&lt;ref name="Herman2010"/&gt;

[[File:Gandhi suit.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Gandhi photographed in South Africa (1909)]]
White soldiers stopped Gandhi and team from treating the injured Zulu, and some African stretcher-bearers with Gandhi were shot dead by the British. The medical team commanded by Gandhi operated for less than two months.&lt;ref name="Herman2010"&gt;[[#Herman2008|Herman (2008)]], pp. 136–137.&lt;/ref&gt; Gandhi volunteering to help as a "staunch loyalist" during the Zulu and other wars made no difference in the British attitude, states Herman, and the African experience was a part of his great disillusionment with the West, transforming him into an "uncompromising non-cooperator".&lt;ref name="Herman2010p281"/&gt;

In 1910, Gandhi established an idealistic community called 'Tolstoy Farm' near Johannesburg, where he nurtured his policy of peaceful resistance.&lt;ref&gt;See [http://philosophynow.org/issues/101/Satyagraha "Gandhi – A Medium for Truth" (link to article in ''Philosophy Now'' magazine)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140324184714/http://philosophynow.org/issues/101/Satyagraha |date=24 March 2014 }}.

In the years after black South Africans gained the right to vote in South Africa (1994), Gandhi was proclaimed a national hero with numerous monuments.&lt;ref name="Mbeki2006"/&gt;

=== Struggle for Indian independence (1915–1947) ===
{{See also|Indian independence movement}}
At the request of [[Gopal Krishna Gokhale]], conveyed to him by [[Charles Freer Andrews|C. F. Andrews]], Gandhi returned to India in 1915. He brought an international reputation as a leading Indian nationalist, theorist and community organiser.

Gandhi joined the [[Indian National Congress]] and was introduced to Indian issues, politics and the Indian people primarily by [[Gopal Krishna Gokhale|Gokhale]]. Gokhale was a key leader of the Congress Party best known for his restraint and moderation, and his insistence on working inside the system. Gandhi took Gokhale's liberal approach based on British Whiggish traditions and transformed it to make it look Indian.&lt;ref name="Whiggism"/&gt;

Gandhi took leadership of the Congress in 1920 and began escalating demands until on 26 January 1930 the Indian National Congress declared the independence of India. The British did not recognise the declaration but negotiations ensued, with the Congress taking a role in provincial government in the late 1930s. Gandhi and the Congress withdrew their support of the Raj when the Viceroy declared war on Germany in September 1939 without consultation. Tensions escalated until Gandhi demanded immediate independence in 1942 and the British responded by imprisoning him and tens of thousands of Congress leaders. Meanwhile, the Muslim League did co-operate with Britain and moved, against Gandhi's strong opposition, to demands for a totally separate Muslim state of Pakistan. In August 1947 the British partitioned the land with India and Pakistan each achieving independence on terms that Gandhi disapproved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Markovits, Claude |title=A History of Modern India, 1480–1950|url=https://books.google.com/?id=uzOmy2y0Zh4C|year=2004|publisher=Anthem Press|pages=367–86|isbn=9781843310044}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Role in World War I====
{{See also|Indian Army during World War I|label 1=The role of India in World War I}}
In April 1918, during the latter part of [[World War I]], the [[Frederic Thesiger, 1st Viscount Chelmsford|Viceroy]] invited Gandhi to a War Conference in Delhi.&lt;ref&gt;
[[s:Chronology of Mahatma Gandhi's life/India 1918|Chronology of Mahatma Gandhi's Life:India 1918]] in WikiSource based on the [[s:The Collected Works of Mahatma Gandhi|Collected Works of Mahatma Gandhi]]. Based on public domain volumes.&lt;/ref&gt; Gandhi agreed to actively recruit Indians for the war effort.&lt;ref name="wikilivres.ca"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Recruiting"&gt;Gandhi (1940). [http://wikilivres.ca/wiki/The_Story_of_My_Experiments_with_Truth/Part_V/Recruiting_Campaign Chapter "Recruiting Campaign"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120702044149/http://wikilivres.ca/wiki/The_Story_of_My_Experiments_with_Truth/Part_V/Recruiting_Campaign |date=2 July 2012 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast to the Zulu War of 1906 and the outbreak of World War I in 1914, when he recruited volunteers for the Ambulance Corps, this time Gandhi attempted to recruit combatants. In a June 1918 leaflet entitled "Appeal for Enlistment", Gandhi wrote "To bring about such a state of things we should have the ability to defend ourselves, that is, the ability to bear arms and to use them...If we want to learn the use of arms with the greatest possible despatch, it is our duty to enlist ourselves in the army."&lt;ref name="CollectedWorks17b"&gt;Gandhi (1965), ''Collected Works'', [http://www.gandhiserve.org/cwmg/VOL017.PDF Vol 17.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091015235028/http://www.gandhiserve.org/cwmg/VOL017.PDF |date=15 October 2009 }} Chapter "67. Appeal for enlistment", Nadiad, 22 June 1918.&lt;/ref&gt; He did, however, stipulate in a letter to the [[John Maffey, 1st Baron Rugby|Viceroy's private secretary]] that he "personally will not kill or injure anybody, friend or foe."&lt;ref name="CollectedWorks17c"&gt;Gandhi (1965), ''Collected Works'', [http://www.gandhiserve.org/cwmg/VOL017.PDF Vol 17.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091015235028/http://www.gandhiserve.org/cwmg/VOL017.PDF |date=15 October 2009 }} "Chapter 8. Letter to J. L. Maffey", Nadiad, 30 April 1918.&lt;/ref&gt;

Gandhi's war recruitment campaign brought into question his consistency on nonviolence. [[Mahadev Desai|Gandhi's private secretary]] noted that "The question of the consistency between his creed of '[[Ahimsa]]' (nonviolence) and his recruiting campaign was raised not only then but has been discussed ever since."&lt;ref name="wikilivres.ca"/&gt;

===Champaran and Kheda===

====Champaran agitations====
{{Main|Champaran Satyagraha}}
[[File:Gandhi Kheda 1918.jpg|thumb|Gandhi in 1918, at the time of the Kheda and Champaran Satyagrahas]]
Gandhi's first major achievement came in 1917 with the Champaran agitation in Bihar. The Champaran agitation pitted the local peasantry against their largely British landlords who were backed by the local administration. The peasantry was forced to grow Indigo, a cash crop whose demand had been declining over two decades, and were forced to sell their crops to the planters at a fixed price. Unhappy with this, the peasantry appealed to Gandhi at his ashram in Ahmedabad. Pursuing a strategy of nonviolent protest, Gandhi took the administration by surprise and won concessions from the authorities.&lt;ref name="Hardiman2001"/&gt;

====Kheda agitations====
{{Main|Kheda Satyagraha}}
In 1918, [[Kheda]] was hit by floods and famine and the peasantry was demanding relief from taxes. Gandhi moved his headquarters to [[Nadiad]],&lt;ref name="Laboratory"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aicc.org.in/satyagraha_laboratories_of_mahatma_gandhi.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061206050856/http://www.aicc.org.in/satyagraha_laboratories_of_mahatma_gandhi.htm |archivedate=6 December 2006 |title=Satyagraha Laboratories of Mahatma Gandhi|year=2004 |work=[[Indian National Congress]] website |publisher=[[All India Congress Committee]] |access-date=25 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; organising scores of supporters and fresh volunteers from the region, the most notable being [[Vallabhbhai Patel]].&lt;ref name="Gandhi Patel"&gt;[[#Rajmohan|Gandhi, Rajmohan (2006)]] [https://books.google.com/?id=FauJL7LKXmkC&amp;pg=196 pp. 196–97].&lt;/ref&gt; Using non-co-operation as a technique, Gandhi initiated a signature campaign where peasants pledged non-payment of revenue even under the threat of confiscation of land. A social boycott of ''mamlatdars'' and ''talatdars'' (revenue officials within the district) accompanied the agitation. Gandhi worked hard to win public support for the agitation across the country. For five months, the administration refused but finally in end-May 1918, the Government gave way on important provisions and relaxed the conditions of payment of revenue tax until the famine ended. In Kheda, Vallabhbhai Patel represented the farmers in negotiations with the British, who suspended revenue collection and released all the prisoners.&lt;ref name="Brown1974"/&gt;

====Khilafat movement====
In 1919 after the World War I was over, Gandhi (aged 49) sought political co-operation from Muslims in his fight against British imperialism by supporting the [[Ottoman Empire]] that had been defeated in the World War. Before this initiative of Gandhi, communal disputes and religious riots between Hindus and Muslims were common in British India, such as the riots of 1917–18. Gandhi had already supported the British crown with resources and by recruiting Indian soldiers to fight the war in Europe on the British side. This effort of Gandhi was in part motivated by the British promise to reciprocate the help with ''swaraj'' (self-government) to Indians after the end of World War I.&lt;ref name=robbins133/&gt; The British government, instead of self government, had offered minor reforms instead, disappointing Gandhi.&lt;ref name="green89"/&gt; Gandhi announced his ''satyagraha'' (civil disobedience) intentions. The British colonial officials made their counter move by passing the [[Rowlatt Act]], to block Gandhi's movement. The Act allowed the British government to treat civil disobedience participants as criminals and gave it the legal basis to arrest anyone for "preventive indefinite detention, incarceration without judicial review or any need for a trial".&lt;ref name=minault68/&gt;

Gandhi felt that Hindu-Muslim co-operation was necessary for political progress against the British. He leveraged the [[Khilafat movement]], wherein [[Sunni]] Muslims in India, their leaders such as the sultans of princely states in India and Ali brothers championed the Turkish [[Caliph]] as a solidarity symbol of Sunni Islamic community (''[[ummah]]''). They saw the Caliph as their means to support Islam and the Islamic law after the defeat of [[Ottoman Empire]] in World War I.&lt;ref&gt;Minault, Gail (1982) ''The Khilafat Movement Religious Symbolism and Political Mobilization in India'', Columbia University Press, {{ISBN|0231050720}}, pp. 4–8&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=paine20/&gt;&lt;ref name=ghosep161/&gt; Gandhi's support to the Khilafat movement led to mixed results. It initially led to a strong Muslim support for Gandhi. However, the Hindu leaders including Rabindranath Tagore questioned Gandhi's leadership because they were largely against recognising or supporting the Sunni Islamic Caliph in Turkey.&lt;ref name=minault68&gt;Minault, Gail (1982) ''The Khilafat Movement Religious Symbolism and Political Mobilization in India'', Columbia University Press, {{ISBN|0231050720}}, pp. 68–72, 78–82, 96–102, 108–109&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Roderick Matthews|title=Jinnah vs. Gandhi |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=r9A4AgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT31 |year=2012|publisher=Hachette|isbn=978-93-5009-078-7|page=31}}, Quote: "Rabindranath Tagore heavily criticized Gandhi at the time in private letters (...).

The increasing Muslim support for Gandhi, after he championed the Caliph's cause, temporarily stopped the Hindu-Muslim communal violence. It offered evidence of inter-communal harmony in joint Rowlatt ''satyagraha'' demonstration rallies, raising Gandhi's stature as the political leader to the British.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Bose, Sugata  |author2=Jalal, Ayesha  |lastauthoramp=yes |title=Modern South History, Culture, Political Economy|url=https://books.google.com/?id=qMJIuHL9ksAC&amp;pg=PA112|year=2004|publisher=Psychology Press|pages=112–14|isbn=9780203712535}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Brown1991|Brown (1991)]] pp. 140–47.&lt;/ref&gt; His support for the Khilafat movement also helped him sideline [[Muhammad Ali Jinnah]], who had announced his opposition to the ''satyagraha'' non-cooperation movement approach of Gandhi.

====Non-co-operation====
{{Main|Non-co-operation movement}}
With his book [[Hind Swaraj]] (1909) Gandhi, aged 40, declared that British rule was established in India with the co-operation of Indians and had survived only because of this co-operation. If Indians refused to co-operate, British rule would collapse and swaraj would come.&lt;ref&gt;Mary Elizabeth King, "Mohandas K, Gandhi and Martin Luther King, Jr.'s Bequest: Nonviolent Civil Resistance in a Globalized World" in {{cite book|author1=Lewis V.

[[File:Gandhi home.jpg|thumb|[[Sabarmati Ashram]], Gandhi's home in Gujarat is now a museum (photographed in 2006).]]

In February 1919, Gandhi cautioned the Viceroy of India with a cable communication that if the British were to pass the [[Rowlatt Act]], he will appeal Indians to start civil disobedience.&lt;ref name="Wolpert2002p99"&gt;{{cite book|author=Stanley Wolpert|title=Gandhi's Passion: The Life and Legacy of Mahatma Gandhi|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KpBy6BCupe4C|year=2002|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-515634-8|pages=99–103|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170219190635/https://books.google.com/books?id=KpBy6BCupe4C|archivedate=19 February 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The British government ignored him, passed the law stating it will not yield to threats. The ''satyagraha'' civil disobedience followed, with people assembling to protest the Rowlatt Act. On 30 March 1919, British law officers opened fire on an assembly of unarmed people, peacefully gathered, participating in ''satyagraha'' in Delhi.&lt;ref name="Wolpert2002p99"/&gt; People rioted in retaliation. On 6 April 1919, a Hindu festival day, he asked a crowd to remember not to injure or kill British people, but express their frustration with peace, to boycott British goods and burn any British clothing they own. He emphasised the use of non-violence to the British and towards each other, even if the other side uses violence. Communities across India announced plans to gather in greater numbers to protest. Government warned him to not enter Delhi. Gandhi defied the order. On 9 April, Gandhi was arrested.&lt;ref name="Wolpert2002p99"/&gt; People rioted. On 13 April 1919, people including women with children gathered in an Amritsar park, and a British officer named [[Reginald Edward Harry Dyer|Reginald Dyer]] surrounded them and ordered his troops to fire on them. The resulting [[Jallianwala Bagh massacre]] (or Amritsar massacre) of hundreds of Sikh and Hindu civilians enraged the subcontinent, but was cheered by some Britons and parts of the British media as an appropriate response. Gandhi in Ahmedabad, on the day after the massacre in Amritsar, did not criticise the British and instead criticised his fellow countrymen for not exclusively using love to deal with the hate of the British government.&lt;ref name="Wolpert2002p99"/&gt; Gandhi demanded that people stop all violence, stop all property destruction, and went on fast-to-death to pressure Indians to stop their rioting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last = Gandhi|first = Mohandas Karamchand |title = [[The Story of My Experiments with Truth|An Autobiography or The Story of My Experiments With Truth]]|publisher=Navajivan Publishing House|location= Ahmedabad|edition=2|page= 82| year = 1940|isbn = 0-8070-5909-9}} Also available at [[s:An Autobiography or The Story of my Experiments with Truth|Wikisource]].&lt;/ref&gt;

The massacre and Gandhi's non-violent response to it moved many, but also made some Sikhs and Hindus upset that Dyer was getting away with murder. Investigation committees were formed by the British, which Gandhi asked Indians to boycott.&lt;ref name="Wolpert2002p99"/&gt; The unfolding events, the massacre and the British response, led Gandhi to the belief that Indians will never get a fair equal treatment under British rulers, and he shifted his attention to ''[[Swaraj]]'' or self rule and political independence for India.&lt;ref name="Chakrabarty2008"&gt;{{cite book|last=Chakrabarty|first=Bidyut|title=Indian Politics and Society since Independence: events, processes and ideology|url=https://books.google.com/?id=QzQHZ178C24C&amp;pg=PA154|access-date=4 April 2012|year=2008|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0-415-40868-4|page=154}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1921, Gandhi was the leader of the Indian National Congress.&lt;ref name=ghosep161/&gt; He reorganised the Congress.

[[File:Gandhi spinning.jpg|left|thumb|Gandhi spinning yarn, in the late 1920s]]

Gandhi expanded his nonviolent non-co-operation platform to include the [[Swadeshi movement|''swadeshi'' policy]] – the boycott of foreign-made goods, especially British goods. Linked to this was his advocacy that ''[[khadi]]'' (homespun cloth) be worn by all Indians instead of British-made textiles. Gandhi exhorted Indian men and women, rich or poor, to spend time each day spinning ''khadi'' in support of the independence movement.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Desai|Desai]], p. 89.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to boycotting British products, Gandhi urged the people to boycott British institutions and law courts, to resign from government employment, and to forsake [[British honours system|British titles and honours]]. Gandhi thus began his journey aimed at crippling the British India government economically, politically and administratively.&lt;ref name="Shashi1996"&gt;[[#Shashi|Shashi]], p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt;

The appeal of "Non-cooperation" grew, its social popularity drew participation from all strata of Indian society. Gandhi was arrested on 10 March 1922, tried for sedition, and sentenced to six years' imprisonment. He began his sentence on 18 March 1922. With Gandhi isolated in prison, the Indian National Congress split into two factions, one led by [[Chitta Ranjan Das]] and [[Motilal Nehru]] favouring party participation in the legislatures, and the other led by [[Chakravarti Rajagopalachari]] and [[Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel]], opposing this move.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Desai|Desai]], p. 131.&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, co-operation among Hindus and Muslims ended as Khilafat movement collapsed with the rise of Ataturk in Turkey. Muslim leaders left the Congress and began forming Muslim organisations. The political base behind Gandhi had broken into factions. Gandhi was released in February 1924 for an [[appendicitis]] operation, having served only two years.&lt;ref name="Datta2006"&gt;{{cite book|last=Datta|first=Amaresh|title=The Encyclopaedia of Indian Literature (Volume Two) (Devraj To Jyoti)|url=https://books.google.com/?id=zB4n3MVozbUC&amp;pg=PA1345|access-date=4 April 2012|date=1 January 2006|publisher=Sahitya Akademi|isbn=978-81-260-1194-0|page=1345}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Salt Satyagraha (Salt March)====
{{Main|Salt Satyagraha}}
[[File:Salt March.ogg|thumb|Original footage of Gandhi and his followers marching to Dandi in the Salt Satyagraha]]

After his early release from prison for political crimes in 1924, over the second half of the 1920s, Gandhi continued to pursue ''swaraj''. He pushed through a resolution at the Calcutta Congress in December 1928 calling on the British government to grant India [[dominion]] status or face a new campaign of non-co-operation with complete independence for the country as its goal.{{sfn|Gandhi|1990|p=172}} After his support for the World War I with Indian combat troops, and the failure of Khilafat movement in preserving the rule of Caliph in Turkey, followed by a collapse in Muslim support for his leadership, some such as [[Subhas Chandra Bose]] and [[Bhagat Singh]] questioned his values and non-violent approach.&lt;ref name=paine20/&gt;&lt;ref name=ghose199/&gt; While many Hindu leaders championed a demand for immediate independence, Gandhi revised his own call to a one-year wait, instead of two.{{sfn|Gandhi|1990|p=172}}

The British did not respond favourably to Gandhi's proposal. British political leaders such as Lord Birkenhead and Winston Churchill announced opposition to "the appeasers of Gandhi", in their discussions with European diplomats who sympathised with Indian demands.&lt;ref&gt;Herman (2008) pp. 419–420&lt;/ref&gt; On 31 December 1929, the flag of India was unfurled in [[Lahore]]. Gandhi led Congress celebrated 26 January 1930 as [[Independence Day (India)|India's Independence Day]] in Lahore. This day was commemorated by almost every other Indian organisation. Gandhi then launched a new Satyagraha against the tax on salt in March 1930. This was highlighted by the famous Salt March to Dandi from 12 March to 6 April, where he marched {{convert|388|km|mi}} from Ahmedabad to Dandi, Gujarat to make salt himself. Thousands of Indians joined him on this march to the sea. This campaign was one of his most successful at upsetting British hold on India; Britain responded by imprisoning over 60,000&amp;nbsp;people.&lt;ref name="Hatt2002"&gt;Hatt (2002), [https://books.google.com/?id=f6vvy-J7vhcC&amp;pg=PA33 p. 33.]&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Sarma, Gandhi recruited women to participate in the salt tax campaigns and the boycott of foreign products, which gave many women a new self-confidence and dignity in the mainstream of Indian public life.&lt;ref name="Sarma1994"/&gt; However, other scholars such as Marilyn French state that Gandhi barred women from joining his civil disobedience movement because he feared he would be accused of using women as political shield.&lt;ref name=french219/&gt; When women insisted that they join the movement and public demonstrations, according to Thapar-Bjorkert, Gandhi asked the volunteers to get permissions of their guardians and only those women who can arrange child-care should join him.&lt;ref name=suruchi77&gt;{{cite book|author=Suruchi Thapar-Bjorkert|title=Women in the Indian National Movement: Unseen Faces and Unheard Voices, 1930–42|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2OyILUFU1NQC&amp;pg=PA77|year=2006|publisher=SAGE Publications|isbn=978-0-7619-3407-3|pages=77–79}}&lt;/ref&gt; Regardless of Gandhi's apprehensions and views, Indian women joined the Salt March by the thousands to defy the British salt taxes and monopoly on salt mining. After Gandhi's arrest, the women marched and picketed shops on their own, accepting violence and verbal abuse from British authorities for the cause in a manner Gandhi inspired.&lt;ref name=french219&gt;{{cite book|author=Marilyn French|title=From Eve to Dawn, A History of Women in the World, Volume IV: Revolutions and Struggles for Justice in the 20th Century|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Hyr9pwbqeqoC  |year=2008|publisher=City University of New York Press|isbn=978-1-55861-628-8|pages=219–220}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Gandhi as folk hero=====
[[File:Indian workers on strike in support of Mahatma Gandhi in 1930.jpg|thumb|Indian workers on strike in support of Gandhi in 1930.]]

According to Atlury Murali, Indian Congress in the 1920s appealed to [[Andhra Pradesh]] peasants by creating Telugu language plays that combined Indian mythology and legends, linked them to Gandhi's ideas, and portrayed Gandhi as a [[messiah]], a reincarnation of ancient and medieval Indian nationalist leaders and saints. The plays built support among peasants steeped in traditional Hindu culture, according to Murali, and this effort made Gandhi a folk hero in Telugu speaking villages, a sacred messiah-like figure.&lt;ref name="Murali1985"/&gt;

According to Dennis Dalton, it was the ideas that were responsible for his wide following. Gandhi criticised Western civilisation as one driven by "brute force and immorality", contrasting it with his categorisation of Indian civilisation as one driven by "soul force and morality".&lt;ref name=dennis20/&gt; Gandhi captured the imagination of the people of his heritage with his ideas about winning "hate with love". These ideas are evidenced in his pamphlets from the 1890s, in South Africa, where too he was popular among the Indian [[Indian indenture system|indentured workers]]. After he returned to India, people flocked to him because he reflected their values.&lt;ref name=dennis20/&gt;

Gandhi also campaigned hard going from one rural corner of the Indian subcontinent to another. He used terminology and phrases such as ''[[Rama]]-rajya'' from ''[[Ramayana]]'', [[Prahlada]] as a paradigmatic icon, and such cultural symbols as another facet of ''swaraj'' and ''satyagraha''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=S.

=====Negotiations=====
The government, represented by [[E. F. L. Wood, 1st Earl of Halifax|Lord Irwin]], decided to negotiate with Gandhi. The [[Gandhi–Irwin Pact]] was signed in March 1931. The British Government agreed to free all political prisoners, in return for the suspension of the civil disobedience movement. According to the pact, Gandhi was invited to attend the Round Table Conference in London for discussions and as the sole representative of the Indian National Congress. The conference was a disappointment to Gandhi and the nationalists. Gandhi expected to discuss India's independence, while the British side focused on the Indian princes and Indian minorities rather than on a transfer of power. Lord Irwin's successor, [[Freeman Freeman-Thomas, 1st Marquess of Willingdon|Lord Willingdon]], took a hard line against India as an independent nation, began a new campaign of controlling and subduing the nationalist movement. Gandhi was again arrested, and the government tried and failed to negate his influence by completely isolating him from his followers.&lt;ref name="Herman2008"&gt;[[#Herman2008|Herman (2008)]] [https://books.google.com/?id=tquxD6dk914C&amp;pg=PA375 pp. 375–77.]&lt;/ref&gt;

In Britain, [[Winston Churchill]], a prominent Conservative politician who was then out of office but later became its prime minister, became a vigorous and articulate critic of Gandhi and opponent of his long-term plans. Churchill often ridiculed Gandhi, saying in a widely reported 1931 speech:
:It is alarming and also nauseating to see Mr Gandhi, a seditious Middle Temple lawyer, now posing as a fakir of a type well known in the East, striding half-naked up the steps of the Vice-regal palace....to parley on equal terms with the representative of the King-Emperor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Arthur Herman|title=Gandhi &amp; Churchill: The Epic Rivalry that Destroyed an Empire and Forged Our Age|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tquxD6dk914C&amp;pg=PA359|year=2008|publisher=Random House|page=359|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160101071616/https://books.google.com/books?id=tquxD6dk914C&amp;pg=PA359|archivedate=1 January 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Churchill's bitterness against Gandhi grew in the 1930s. He called Gandhi as the one who was "seditious in aim" whose evil genius and multiform menace was attacking the British empire. Churchill called him a dictator, a "Hindu [[Mussolini]]", fomenting a race war, trying to replace the Raj with [[Brahmin]] cronies, playing on the ignorance of Indian masses, all for selfish gain.&lt;ref name="Herman2008p378"/&gt; Churchill attempted to isolate Gandhi, and his criticism of Gandhi was widely covered by European and American press. It gained Churchill sympathetic support, but it also increased support for Gandhi among Europeans. The developments heightened Churchill's anxiety that the "British themselves would give up out of pacifism and misplaced conscience".&lt;ref name="Herman2008p378"&gt;{{cite book|author=Arthur Herman|title=Gandhi &amp; Churchill: The Epic Rivalry that Destroyed an Empire and Forged Our Age|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tquxD6dk914C|year=2008|publisher=Random House|isbn=978-0-553-90504-5|pages=378–381|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140913065817/http://books.google.com/books?id=tquxD6dk914C|archivedate=13 September 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Round Table Conferences====
[[File:Mahadev Desai and Gandhi 2 1939.jpg|thumb|[[Mahadev Desai]] (left) was Gandhi's personal assistant, both at Birla House, Bombay, 7 April 1939]]

During the discussions between Gandhi and the British government over 1931–32 at the [[Round Table Conferences (India)|Round Table Conferences]], Gandhi, now aged about 62, sought constitutional reforms as a preparation to the end of colonial British rule, and begin the self-rule by Indians.&lt;ref name="Muldoon92"/&gt; The British side sought reforms that would keep Indian subcontinent as a colony. The British negotiators proposed constitutional reforms on a British Dominion model that established separate electorates based on religious and social divisions. The British questioned the Congress party and Gandhi's authority to speak for all of India.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Rajmohan Gandhi|title=Gandhi: The Man, His People, and the Empire|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FauJL7LKXmkC|year=2006|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-25570-8|pages=332–333|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170222104043/https://books.google.com/books?id=FauJL7LKXmkC|archivedate=22 February 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; They invited Indian religious leaders, such as Muslims and Sikhs, to press their demands along religious lines, as well as [[B.

After Gandhi returned from the Second Round Table conference, he started a new ''satyagraha''. He was arrested and imprisoned at the [[Yerwada Jail]], Pune. While he was in prison, the British government enacted a new law that granted untouchables a separate electorate.

====Congress politics====
In 1934 Gandhi resigned from Congress party membership. He did not disagree with the party's position but felt that if he resigned, his popularity with Indians would cease to stifle the party's membership, which actually varied, including communists, socialists, trade unionists, students, religious conservatives, and those with pro-business convictions, and that these various voices would get a chance to make themselves heard. Gandhi also wanted to avoid being a target for Raj propaganda by leading a party that had temporarily accepted political accommodation with the Raj.{{sfn|Gandhi|1990|p=246}}

Gandhi returned to active politics again in 1936, with the Nehru presidency and the Lucknow session of the Congress. Although Gandhi wanted a total focus on the task of winning independence and not speculation about India's future, he did not restrain the Congress from adopting socialism as its goal. Gandhi had a clash with Subhas Chandra Bose, who had been elected president in 1938, and who had previously expressed a lack of faith in nonviolence as a means of protest.&lt;ref&gt;Ghose, Sankar (1992).

====World War II and ''Quit India movement''====
{{Main|Quit India Movement}}
[[File:Gandhi and Nehru 1942.jpg|thumb|Nehru and Gandhi in 1946]]
Gandhi opposed providing any help to the British war effort and he campaigned against any Indian participation in the World War II.&lt;ref name=herman467/&gt; Gandhi's campaign did not enjoy the support of Indian masses and many Indian leaders such as Sardar Patel and Rajendra Prasad. His campaign was a failure.&lt;ref name=herman467/&gt; Over 2.5&amp;nbsp;million Indians ignored Gandhi, volunteered and joined the British military to fight on various fronts of the allied forces.&lt;ref name=herman467&gt;{{cite book|author=Arthur Herman|title=Gandhi &amp; Churchill: The Epic Rivalry that Destroyed an Empire and Forged Our Age|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tquxD6dk914C|year=2008|publisher=Random House|isbn=978-0-553-90504-5|pages=467–470|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140913065817/http://books.google.com/books?id=tquxD6dk914C|archivedate=13 September 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gandhi opposition to the Indian participation in the World War II was motivated by his belief that India could not be party to a war ostensibly being fought for democratic freedom while that freedom was denied to India itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Bipan Chandra|title=India's Struggle for Independence|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0q7xH06NrFkC&amp;pg=PT543|year=2000|publisher=Penguin Books|isbn=978-81-8475-183-3|page=543}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also condemned Nazism and Fascism, a view which won endorsement of other Indian leaders. As the war progressed, Gandhi intensified his demand for independence, calling for the British to ''Quit India'' in a 1942 speech in Mumbai.&lt;ref name="Wolpertp74"&gt;{{cite book|author=Stanley Wolpert|title=Gandhi's Passion: The Life and Legacy of Mahatma Gandhi|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KpBy6BCupe4C|year=2002|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-515634-8|pages=74–75|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170219190635/https://books.google.com/books?id=KpBy6BCupe4C|archivedate=19 February 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was Gandhi's and the Congress Party's most definitive revolt aimed at securing the British exit from India.{{sfn|Gandhi|1990|p=309}} The British government responded quickly to the Quit India speech, and within hours after Gandhi's speech arrested Gandhi and all the members of the Congress Working Committee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Gurcharan Das|title=A Fine Family|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IgbeMDKvkU0C&amp;pg=PA49 |year=1990 |publisher= Penguin Books|isbn=978-0-14-012258-9|pages=49–50}}&lt;/ref&gt; His countrymen retaliated the arrests by damaging or burning down hundreds of government owned railway stations, police stations, and cutting down telegraph wires.&lt;ref name="Wolpertp205"/&gt;

In 1942, Gandhi now nearing age 73, urged his people to completely stop co-operating with the imperial government. In this effort, he urged that they neither kill nor injure British people, but be willing to suffer and die if violence is initiated by the British officials.&lt;ref name="Wolpertp74"/&gt; He clarified that the movement would not be stopped because of any individual acts of violence, saying that the ''"ordered anarchy"'' of ''"the present system of administration"'' was ''"worse than real anarchy."''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Mahatma and mother India: essays on Gandhiʼs nonviolence and nationalism |last=Brock |first=Peter |year=1983 |publisher=[[Navajivan Publishing House]] |page=34 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=vRduAAAAMAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Mahatma Gandhi and Jawaharlal Nehru: a historic partnership |last=Limaye |first=Madhu |authorlink1=Madhu Limaye |isbn=8170185475 |publisher=B.

[[File:Gandhi writing 1942.jpg|thumb|left|Gandhi in 1942, the year he launched Quit India movement]]
Gandhi's arrest lasted two years, as he was held in the [[Aga Khan Palace]] in [[Pune]]. During this period, his long time secretary Mahadev Desai died of a heart attack, his wife Kasturba died after 18 months' imprisonment on 22 February 1944; and Gandhi suffered a severe [[malaria]] attack.&lt;ref name="Wolpertp205"&gt;{{cite book|author=Stanley Wolpert|title=Gandhi's Passion: The Life and Legacy of Mahatma Gandhi|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KpBy6BCupe4C|year=2002|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-515634-8|pages=205–211|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170219190635/https://books.google.com/books?id=KpBy6BCupe4C|archivedate=19 February 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; While in Jail, he agreed to an interview with Stuart Gelder, a British journalist. Gelder then composed and released an interview summary, cabled it to the mainstream press, that announced sudden concessions Gandhi was willing to make, comments that shocked his countrymen, the Congress workers and even Gandhi. The latter two claimed that it distorted what Gandhi actually said on a range of topics and falsely repudiated the Quit India movement.&lt;ref name="Wolpertp205"/&gt;

Gandhi was released before the end of the war on 6 May 1944 because of his failing health and necessary surgery; the Raj did not want him to die in prison and enrage the nation. He came out of detention to an altered political scene – the [[All-India Muslim League|Muslim League]] for example, which a few years earlier had appeared marginal, "now occupied the centre of the political stage"&lt;ref name="Lapping1989"/&gt; and the topic of [[Muhammad Ali Jinnah]]'s campaign for Pakistan was a major talking point. Gandhi and Jinnah had extensive correspondence and the two men met several times over a period of two weeks in September 1944, where Gandhi insisted on a united religiously plural and independent India which included Muslims and non-Muslims of the Indian subcontinent coexisting. Jinnah rejected this proposal and insisted instead for partitioning the subcontinent on religious lines to create a separate Muslim India (later Pakistan).&lt;ref name=Khan2007-page1/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Mahatma Gandhi|title=The Collected Works of Mahatma Gandhi|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0awHaT3ZmdEC|year=2000|isbn=978-81-230-0169-2|pages=456–462}}, Archive of [https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.61312/2015.61312.Gandhi-jinnah-Talks#page/n29/mode/2up Gandhi-Jinnah communications (pp. 11–34)]&lt;/ref&gt; These discussions continued through 1947.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Gandhi, Jinnah Meet First Time Since '44; Disagree on Pakistan, but Will Push Peace |access-date=25 March 2012 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1947/05/07/archives/gandhi-jinnah-meet-first-time-since-44-disagree-on-pakistan-but.html |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=7 May 1947 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130430103734/http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F30A1EFA3F58147B93C5A9178ED85F438485F9 |archivedate=30 April 2013 |df=dmy-all }} {{subscription needed}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the leaders of Congress languished in jail, the other parties supported the war and gained organizational strength. Underground publications flailed at the ruthless suppression of Congress, but it had little control over events.&lt;ref name="BhattacharyaStudies2001"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bhattacharya|first1=Sanjoy|title=Propaganda and information in Eastern India, 1939–45: a necessary weapon of war|url=https://books.google.com/?id=M2GI26jditsC&amp;pg=PA33|year=2001|publisher=Psychology Press|isbn=978-0-7007-1406-3|page=33}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of the war, the British gave clear indications that power would be transferred to Indian hands. At this point Gandhi called off the struggle, and around 100,000 political prisoners were released, including the Congress's leadership.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;[[#Shashi|Shashi]], p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Partition and independence====
{{See also|Partition of India}}
[[File:Gandhi Jinnah 1944.jpg|thumb|left|Gandhi with [[Muhammad Ali Jinnah]] in 1944]]

Gandhi opposed [[Partition (law)|partition]] of the [[Indian subcontinent]] along religious lines.&lt;ref&gt;Reprinted in [[#Fischer2002|Fischer (2002)]], pp. 106–08.&lt;/ref&gt; The Indian National Congress and Gandhi called for the [[British Empire|British]] to [[Quit India Movement|Quit India]].

Jinnah rejected Gandhi's proposal and called for [[Direct Action Day]], on 16 August 1946, to press Muslims to publicly gather in cities and support his proposal for partition of Indian subcontinent into a Muslim state and non-Muslim state. Huseyn Shaheed Suhrawardy, the Muslim League Chief Minister of Bengal – now [[Bangladesh]] and [[West Bengal]], gave Calcutta's police special holiday to celebrate the Direct Action Day.&lt;ref name="Wolpert118"&gt;{{cite book|author=Stanley Wolpert|title=Shameful Flight: The Last Years of the British Empire in India|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zuoMsBWCTBUC|year=2009|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-539394-1|pages=118–121|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131001210558/http://books.google.com/books?id=zuoMsBWCTBUC|archivedate=1 October 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Direct Action Day triggered a mass murder of Calcutta Hindus and the torching of their property, and holidaying police were missing to contain or stop the conflict.&lt;ref name="Chapter 1"&gt;[[#Wolpert|Wolpert]], [https://www.nytimes.com/books/first/w/wolpert-gandhi.html Chapter 1.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160321161002/http://www.nytimes.com/books/first/w/wolpert-gandhi.html |date=21 March 2016 }}, Oxford University Press&lt;/ref&gt; The British government did not order its army to move in to contain the violence.&lt;ref name="Wolpert118"/&gt; The violence on Direct Action Day led to retaliatory violence against Muslims across India.

[[File:Mountbattens with Gandhi (IND 5298).jpg|thumb|Gandhi in 1947, with Lord [[Louis Mountbatten, 1st Earl Mountbatten of Burma|Louis Mountbatten]], Britain's last Viceroy of India, and his wife [[Edwina Mountbatten, Countess Mountbatten of Burma|Edwina Mountbatten]]]]

[[Archibald Wavell, 1st Earl Wavell|Archibald Wavell]], the Viceroy and Governor-General of British India for three years through February 1947, had worked with Gandhi and Jinnah to find a common ground, before and after accepting Indian independence in principle. Wavell condemned Gandhi's character and motives as well as his ideas. Wavell accused Gandhi of harbouring the single minded idea to "overthrow British rule and influence and to establish a Hindu raj", and called Gandhi a "malignant, malevolent, exceedingly shrewd" politician.&lt;ref name="Dalton2012p65"/&gt; Wavell feared a civil war on the Indian subcontinent, and doubted Gandhi would be able to stop it.&lt;ref name="Dalton2012p65"&gt;{{cite book|author=Dennis Dalton|title=Mahatma Gandhi: Nonviolent Power in Action|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=shCQVfWixiAC |year= 2012|publisher= Columbia University Press|isbn= 978-0-231-53039-2|pages=64–66}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The British reluctantly agreed to grant independence to the people of the Indian subcontinent, but accepted Jinnah's proposal of partitioning the land into Pakistan and India. Gandhi was involved in the final negotiations, but [[Stanley Wolpert]] states the "plan to carve up British India was never approved of or accepted by Gandhi".&lt;ref&gt;[[#Wolpert|Wolpert]], Oxford University Press, p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;

The partition was controversial and violently disputed. More than half a million were killed in religious riots as 10 million to 12&amp;nbsp;million non-Muslims (Hindus, Sikhs mostly) migrated from Pakistan into India, and Muslims migrated from India into Pakistan, across the newly created borders of India, West Pakistan and East Pakistan.&lt;ref name="MetcalfMetcalf2006"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Metcalf|first1=Barbara Daly|last2=Metcalf|first2=Thomas R.|title=A concise history of modern India|url=https://books.google.com/?id=iuESgYNYPl0C|year=2006|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-86362-9|pages=221–22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gandhi spent the day of independence not celebrating the end of the British rule but appealing for peace among his countrymen by fasting and spinning in Calcutta on 15 August 1947. The partition had gripped the Indian subcontinent with religious violence and the streets were filled with corpses.&lt;ref name=gs/&gt; Some writers credit Gandhi's fasting and protests for stopping the religious riots and communal violence. Others do not. Archibald Wavell, for example, upon learning of Gandhi's assassination, commented, "I always thought he [Gandhi] had more of malevolence than benevolence in him, but who am I to judge, and how can an Englishman estimate a Hindu?"&lt;ref name="Dalton2012p65"/&gt;

Gandhi's death was mourned nationwide. Over two million people joined the five-mile long funeral procession that took over five hours to reach Raj Ghat from Birla house, where he was assassinated. Gandhi's body was transported on a weapons carrier, whose chassis was dismantled overnight to allow a high-floor to be installed so that people could catch a glimpse of his body. The engine of the vehicle was not used; instead four drag-ropes manned by 50 people each pulled the vehicle.&lt;ref name=ie48/&gt; All Indian-owned establishments in London remained closed in mourning as thousands of people from all faiths and denominations and Indians from all over Britain converged at [[India House, London|India House]] in London.&lt;ref name=ie48pg5/&gt;

Gandhi's assassination dramatically changed the political landscape. Nehru became his political heir. According to Markovits, while Gandhi was alive, Pakistan's declaration that it was a "Muslim state" had led Indian groups to demand that it be declared a "Hindu state".&lt;ref name="Markovits2004p57"/&gt; Nehru used Gandhi's martyrdom as a political weapon to silence all advocates of Hindu nationalism as well as his political challengers. He linked Gandhi's assassination to politics of hatred and ill-will.&lt;ref name="Markovits2004p57"/&gt;

According to Guha, Nehru and his Congress colleagues called on Indians to honour Gandhi's memory and even more his ideals.&lt;ref&gt;Guha, Ramachandra (2007), ''[[India after Gandhi]]'', Harper Collins, {{ISBN|978-0-330-50554-3}}, pp. 37–40.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gopal, Sarvepalli (1979), ''Jawaharlal Nehru'', Jonathan Cape, London, {{ISBN|0224016210}}, pp. 16–17.&lt;/ref&gt; Nehru used the assassination to consolidate the authority of the new Indian state. Gandhi's death helped marshal support for the new government and legitimise the Congress Party's control, leveraged by the massive outpouring of Hindu expressions of grief for a man who had inspired them for decades. The government suppressed the [[Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh|RSS]], the Muslim National Guards, and the [[Khaksars]], with some 200,000 arrests.&lt;ref name="Khan2011"/&gt;

For years after the assassination, states Markovits, "Gandhi's shadow loomed large over the political life of the new Indian Republic". The government quelled any opposition to its economic and social policies, despite they being contrary to Gandhi's ideas, by reconstructing Gandhi's image and ideals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Claude Markovits|title=The UnGandhian Gandhi: The Life and Afterlife of the Mahatma|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SpDvZO8xNNgC&amp;pg=PA57 |year=2004|publisher=Anthem Press|isbn=978-1-84331-127-0|pages=58–62}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Funeral and memorials====
Gandhi was cremated in accordance with Hindu tradition. Gandhi's ashes were poured into urns which were sent across India for memorial services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=LIFE|url=https://books.google.com/?id=LEEEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA76|date=15 March 1948|publisher=Time Inc|page=76|issn=0024-3019}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the ashes were immersed at the [[Sangam at Allahabad]] on 12 February 1948, but some were secretly taken away. In 1997, [[Tushar Gandhi]] immersed the contents of one urn, found in a bank vault and reclaimed through the courts, at the Sangam at Allahabad.&lt;ref name="Guardian-2008-ashes"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kumar2006"/&gt; Some of Gandhi's ashes were scattered at the source of the [[Nile River]] near [[Jinja, Uganda]], and a memorial plaque marks the event. On 30 January 2008, the contents of another urn were immersed at [[Girgaum Chowpatty]]. Another urn is at the [[Aga Khan Palace|palace]] of the [[Aga Khan]] in [[Pune]] (where Gandhi was held as a political prisoner from 1942 to 1944) and another in the [[Self-Realization Fellowship Lake Shrine]] in Los Angeles.&lt;ref name="Guardian-2008-ashes" /&gt;&lt;ref name="GWPM"/&gt;

The Birla House site where Gandhi was assassinated is now a memorial called Gandhi Smriti. The place near Yamuna river where he was cremated is the [[Raj Ghat and other memorials|Rāj Ghāt]] memorial in New Delhi.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Margot Bigg|title=Delhi|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kmP1ALZKj2cC&amp;pg=PA14|year=2012|publisher=Avalon|isbn=1-61238-490-0|page=14}}&lt;/ref&gt; A black marble platform, it bears the epigraph "Hē Rāma" ([[Devanagari]]: ''हे ! राम'' or, ''Hey [[Rama|Raam]]'').

==Principles, practices and beliefs==
Gandhi's statements, letters and life have attracted much political and scholarly analysis of his principles, practices and beliefs, including what influenced him. Some writers present him as a paragon of ethical living and pacifism, while others present him as a more complex, contradictory and evolving character influenced by his culture and circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=William Borman|title=Gandhi and Non-Violence|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=U6DE9OUvrTEC |year= 1986|publisher= State University of New York Press|isbn=978-0-88706-331-2|pages=192–195, 208–209}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Dennis Dalton|title=Mahatma Gandhi: Nonviolent Power in Action|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KxUp1igCL_0C |year=2012|publisher=Columbia University Press|isbn=978-0-231-15959-3|pages=30–35}}, Quote: "Yet he [Gandhi] must bear some of the responsibility for losing his followers along the way. The sheer vagueness and contradictions recurrent throughout his writing made it easier to accept him as a saint than to fathom the challenge posed by his demanding beliefs. Gandhi saw no harm in self-contradictions: life was a series of experiments, and any principle might change if Truth so dictated".&lt;/ref&gt;

===Influences===
[[File:Tagore Gandhi.jpg|thumb|Gandhi with poet [[Rabindranath Tagore]], 1940]]

Gandhi grew up in a [[Hindu]] and [[Jain]] religious atmosphere in his native Gujarat, which were his primary influences, but he was also influenced by his personal reflections and literature of Hindu Bhakti saints, [[Advaita Vedanta]], [[Islam]], [[Buddhism]], [[Christianity]], and thinkers such as [[Tolstoy]], [[John Ruskin|Ruskin]] and [[Thoreau]].&lt;ref name=brown93&gt;{{cite book|author1=Brown, Judith M.  |author2=Parel, Anthony  |lastauthoramp=yes |title=The Cambridge Companion to Gandhi|url=https://books.google.com/?id=KLM8kMZZu-IC&amp;pg=PA93|year=2011|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-13345-6|page=93}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Indira Carr|editor=Stuart Brown et al.|title=Biographical Dictionary of Twentieth-Century Philosophers|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UZQqBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA263 |year=2012|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-134-92796-8|pages=263–264}}, Quote: "Gandhi, Mohandas Karamchand. Indian. born: 2 October 1869, Gujarat; (...) Influences: [[Vaishnavism]], [[Jainism]] and [[Advaita Vedanta]]."&lt;/ref&gt; At age 57 he declared himself to be [[Advaita Vedanta|Advaitist Hindu]] in his religious persuasion, but added that he supported [[Dvaita|Dvaitist]] viewpoints and religious pluralism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=J.

Gandhi was influenced by his devout Vaishnava Hindu mother, the regional Hindu temples and [[Bhakti movement|saint tradition]] which co-existed with Jain tradition in Gujarat.&lt;ref name=brown93/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Anil Mishra|title=Reading Gandhi|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Xa8cD95Mt4YC&amp;pg=PA2 |year=2012|publisher=Pearson |isbn=978-81-317-9964-2|page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Historian R.B. Cribb states that Gandhi's thought evolved over time, with his early ideas becoming the core or scaffolding for his mature philosophy. He committed himself early to truthfulness, [[Temperance (virtue)|temperance]], [[chastity]], and vegetarianism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Cribb | first1 = R. B. | year = 1985 | title = The Early Political Philosophy of M. K. Gandhi, 1869–1893 | journal = Asian Profile | volume = 13 | issue = 4| pages = 353–60 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gandhi's London lifestyle incorporated the values he had grown up with. When he returned to India in 1891, his outlook was parochial and he could not make a living as a lawyer. This challenged his belief that practicality and morality necessarily coincided. By moving in 1893 to South Africa he found a solution to this problem and developed the central concepts of his mature philosophy.&lt;ref name="Crib1985"&gt;Crib (1985).&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Bhikhu Parekh, three books that influenced Gandhi most in South Africa were [[William Mackintire Salter|William Salter's]] ''Ethical Religion'' (1889); [[Henry David Thoreau]]'s ''[[Civil Disobedience (Thoreau)|On the Duty of Civil Disobedience]]'' (1849); and [[Leo Tolstoy]]'s ''[[The Kingdom of God Is Within You]]'' (1894). Ruskin inspired his decision to live an austere life on a commune, at first on the Phoenix Farm in Natal and then on the Tolstoy Farm just outside Johannesburg, South Africa.&lt;ref name="Parekh2001"/&gt; The most profound influence on Gandhi were those from Hinduism, Christianity and Jainism, states Parekh, with his thoughts "in harmony with the classical Indian traditions, specially the Advaita or monistic tradition".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Bhikhu C. Parekh|title=Gandhi|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Qwyjly4tTUUC |year=2001|publisher=Sterling Publishing|isbn=978-1-4027-6887-3|pages=43, 71}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Indira Carr and others, Gandhi was influenced by Vaishnavism, Jainism and Advaita Vedanta.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Indira Carr|editor=Stuart Brown et al.|title=Biographical Dictionary of Twentieth-Century Philosophers|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UZQqBgAAQBAJ |year=2012|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-134-92796-8|page=263}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Glyn Richards|title=Studies in Religion: A Comparative Approach to Theological and Philosophical Themes |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fQ2_DAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA64 |year=2016|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-1-349-24147-7|pages=64–78}}&lt;/ref&gt; Balkrishna Gokhale states that Gandhi was influenced by Hinduism and Jainism, and his studies of Sermon on the Mount of Christianity, Ruskin and Tolstoy.&lt;ref name="BGB"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Gokhale |first1=Balkrishna Govind |year=1972 |title=Gandhi and History |journal=History and Theory |volume=11 |issue=2 |pages=214–25 |doi=10.2307/2504587 |jstor=2504587 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additional theories of possible influences on Gandhi have been proposed. For example, in 1935, N. A. Toothi stated that Gandhi was influenced by the reforms and teachings of the [[Swaminarayan]] tradition of Hinduism. According to Raymond Williams, Toothi may have overlooked the influence of the Jain community, and adds close parallels do exist in programs of social reform in the Swaminarayan tradition and those of Gandhi, based on "nonviolence, truth-telling, cleanliness, temperance and upliftment of the masses."&lt;ref name=rbw01&gt;{{cite book|last=Williams|first=Raymond Brady|title=An introduction to Swaminarayan Hinduism|year=2001|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=0-521-65422-X|page=173}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=mhe94&gt;{{cite book|last=Meller|first=Helen Elizabeth|title=Patrick Geddes: social evolutionist and city planner|year=1994|publisher=Routledge|isbn=0-415-10393-2|page=159}}&lt;/ref&gt; Historian Howard states the culture of Gujarat influenced Gandhi and his methods.&lt;ref name=Spodek&gt;{{cite journal|last=Spodek|first=Howard|title=On the Origins of Gandhi's Political Methodology: The Heritage of Kathiawad and Gujarat|journal=Journal of Asian Studies|year= 1971| volume=30 |issue=2 |pages=361–72 |jstor=2942919 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Tolstoy====
[[File:Gandhi Tolstoy Farm.jpg|thumb|Mohandas K. Gandhi and other residents of [[Tolstoyan movement#Africa|Tolstoy Farm]], South Africa, 1910]]

Along with the book mentioned above, in 1908 [[Leo Tolstoy]] wrote ''[[A Letter to a Hindu]],'' which said that only by using love as a weapon through [[passive resistance]] could the Indian people overthrow colonial rule. In 1909, Gandhi wrote to Tolstoy seeking advice and permission to republish ''A Letter to a Hindu'' in Gujarati. Tolstoy responded and the two continued a correspondence until Tolstoy's death in 1910 (Tolstoy's last letter was to Gandhi).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Mahatma Gandhi and Leo Tolstoy: Letters |editor=B.

However, they differed sharply on political strategy. Gandhi called for political involvement; he was a nationalist and was prepared to use nonviolent force. He was also willing to compromise.&lt;ref name="Green1986"&gt;{{cite book|author=Green, Martin Burgess |title=The origins of nonviolence: Tolstoy and Gandhi in their historical settings|url=https://books.google.com/?id=D0luAAAAMAAJ|access-date=17 January 2012|year=1986|publisher=Pennsylvania State University Press|isbn=978-0-271-00414-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was at Tolstoy Farm where Gandhi and [[Hermann Kallenbach]] systematically trained their disciples in the philosophy of nonviolence.&lt;ref name="Bhana"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Bhana |first1=Surendra |year=1979 |title=Tolstoy Farm, A Satyagrahi's Battle Ground |journal=Journal of Indian History |volume=57 |issue=2/3 |pages=431–40}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Shrimad Rajchandra====
Gandhi credited [[Shrimad Rajchandra]], a poet and Jain philosopher, as his influential counsellor. In ''Modern Review'', June 1930, Gandhi wrote about their first encounter in 1891 at Dr. P.J. Mehta's residence in Bombay. Gandhi exchanged letters with Rajchandra when he was in South Africa, referring to him as ''Kavi'' (literally, "poet"). In 1930, Gandhi wrote, "Such was the man who captivated my heart in religious matters as no other man ever has till now."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gandhi|first1=Mahatma|title=Gandhi: An Autobiography|isbn=0807059099|pages=63–65|edition=Beacon Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; 'I have said elsewhere that in moulding my inner life Tolstoy and Ruskin vied with Kavi. But Kavi's influence was undoubtedly deeper if only because I had come in closest personal touch with him.'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Webber|first1= Thomas|title=Gandhi as Disciple and Mentor|date=3 March 2011|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn =0521174481|pages=33–36 |edition= 3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gandhi, in his autobiography, called Rajchandra his "guide and helper" and his "refuge [...] in moments of spiritual crisis". He had advised Gandhi to be patient and to study Hinduism deeply.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gandhi|first1=Mahatma|title=Modern Review|date=June 1930}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gandhi1957"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Weber2004"&gt;{{cite book|author=Thomas Weber|title=Gandhi as Disciple and Mentor|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=P8nC80pG4GIC&amp;pg=PA34|date=2 December 2004|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-1-139-45657-9|pages=34–36}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Religious texts====
During his stay in [[South Africa]], along with scriptures and philosophical texts of Hinduism and other Indian religions, Gandhi read translated texts of Christianity such as the [[Bible]], and Islam such as the [[Quran]].&lt;ref name=britgandhirel/&gt; A Quaker mission in South Africa attempted to convert him to Christianity. Gandhi joined them in their prayers and debated Christian theology with them, but refused conversion stating he did not accept the theology therein or that Christ was the only son of God.&lt;ref name=britgandhirel/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Martin Burgess Green|title=Gandhi: voice of a new age revolution|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=emNuAAAAMAAJ|year= 1993| publisher= Continuum| isbn=978-0-8264-0620-0|pages=123–125}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Fischer Louis|title=The life of Mahatma Gandhi|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8qwqAAAAYAAJ |year=1950|publisher=HarperCollins |isbn=978-0-06-091038-9|pages=43–44}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His comparative studies of religions and interaction with scholars, led him to respect all religions as well as become concerned about imperfections in all of them and frequent misinterpretations.&lt;ref name=britgandhirel/&gt; Gandhi grew fond of Hinduism, and referred to the ''[[Bhagavad Gita]]'' as his spiritual dictionary and greatest single influence on his life.&lt;ref name=britgandhirel&gt;{{Cite web| title=Mahatma Gandhi – The religious quest {{!}} Biography, Accomplishments, &amp; Facts| url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Mahatma-Gandhi/Resistance-and-results#toc22635| work=Encyclopædia Britannica| year=2015| access-date=3 June 2017| language=en| deadurl=no| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170513020112/https://www.britannica.com/biography/Mahatma-Gandhi/Resistance-and-results#toc22635| archivedate=13 May 2017| df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Ghose, Sankar |title=Mahatma Gandhi|url=https://books.google.com/?id=5l0BPnxN1h8C |year=1991|publisher= Allied Publishers|pages= 377–378|isbn= 9788170232056}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Richard H.

===On wars and nonviolence===
====Support for Wars====
Gandhi participated in South African war against the Boers, on the British side in 1899.&lt;ref name=ghose275/&gt; Both the Dutch settlers called Boers and the imperial British at that time discriminated against the coloured races they considered as inferior, and Gandhi later wrote about his conflicted beliefs during the Boer war. He stated that "when the war was declared, my personal sympathies were all with the Boers, but my loyalty to the British rule drove me to participation with the British in that war". According to Gandhi, he felt that since he was demanding his rights as a British citizen, it was also his duty to serve the British forces in the defence of the British Empire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Simone Panter-Brick|title=Gandhi and Nationalism: The Path to Indian Independence|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-aIcBgAAQBAJ |year=2015|publisher=I.B.Tauris|isbn=978-1-78453-023-5|pages=75–77}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Mahatma Gandhi|title=All Men Are Brothers|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LSzUAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA22 |year=2005|publisher= Bloomsbury Academic|isbn= 978-0-8264-1739-8|page=22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During World War I (1914–1918), nearing the age of 50, Gandhi supported the British and its allied forces by recruiting Indians to join the British army, expanding the Indian contingent from about 100,000 to over 1.1&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref name="green89"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Michael J.

In parallel, Gandhi's fellowmen became sceptical of his pacifist ideas and were inspired by the ideas of nationalism and anti-imperialism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Rahul Sagar|editor=David M. Malone et al.|title=The Oxford Handbook of Indian Foreign Policy|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=McwfCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA70 |year=2015 |publisher= Oxford University Press|isbn= 978-0-19-106118-9|pages=71–73}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 1920 essay, after the World War I, Gandhi wrote, "where there is only a choice between cowardice and violence, I would advise violence." Rahul Sagar interprets Gandhi's efforts to recruit for the British military during the War, as Gandhi's belief that, at that time, it would demonstrate that Indians were willing to fight. Further, it would also show the British that his fellow Indians were "their subjects by choice rather than out of cowardice." In 1922, Gandhi wrote that abstinence from violence is effective and true forgiveness only when one has the power to punish, not when one decides not to do anything because one is helpless.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Rahul Sagar|editor=David M. Malone et al.|title=The Oxford Handbook of Indian Foreign Policy|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=McwfCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA70 |year=2015 |publisher= Oxford University Press|isbn= 978-0-19-106118-9|page=70}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After World War II engulfed Britain, Gandhi actively campaigned to oppose any help to the British war effort and any Indian participation in the war. According to Arthur Herman, Gandhi believed that his campaign would strike a blow to imperialism.&lt;ref name=herman467/&gt; Gandhi's position was not supported by many Indian leaders, and his campaign against the British war effort was a failure. The Hindu leader, [[Tej Bahadur Sapru]] declared in 1941, states Herman, "A good many Congress leaders are fed up with the barren program of the Mahatma".&lt;ref name=herman467/&gt; Over 2.5&amp;nbsp;million Indians ignored Gandhi, volunteered and joined on the British side. They fought and died as a part of the allied forces in Europe, North Africa and various fronts of the World War II.&lt;ref name="herman467"/&gt;

====Truth and Satyagraha====
[[File:Mahatma Gandhi on Rumours.jpg|thumb|Plaque displaying one of Gandhi's quotes on rumour]]

Gandhi dedicated his life to discovering and pursuing truth, or ''[[Satya]]'', and called his movement as ''satyagraha'', which means "appeal to, insistence on, or reliance on the Truth".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Gene Sharp|title=Gandhi Wields the Weapon of Moral Power: Three Case Histories |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SUhuAAAAMAAJ |year=1960|publisher=Navajivan|page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first formulation of the ''satyagraha'' as a political movement and principle occurred in 1920, which he tabled as "Resolution on Non-cooperation" in September that year before a session of the Indian Congress. It was the ''satyagraha'' formulation and step, states Dennis Dalton, that deeply resonated with beliefs and culture of his people, embedded him into the popular consciousness, transforming him quickly into Mahatma.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Dennis Dalton|title=Mahatma Gandhi: Nonviolent Power in Action|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KxUp1igCL_0C |year=2012|publisher=Columbia University Press|isbn=978-0-231-15959-3|pages=30–32}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gandhi based ''Satyagraha'' on the Vedantic ideal of self-realization, ahimsa (nonviolence), vegetarianism, and universal love. William Borman states that the key to his ''satyagraha'' is rooted in the Hindu [[Upanishads|Upanishadic]] texts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=William Borman|title=Gandhi and Non-Violence|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=U6DE9OUvrTEC |year=1986|publisher=State University of New York Press|isbn=978-0-88706-331-2|pages=26–34}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Indira Carr, Gandhi's ideas on ''ahimsa'' and ''satyagraha'' were founded on the philosophical foundations of Advaita Vedanta.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Indira Carr|editor=Stuart Brown et al.|title=Biographical Dictionary of Twentieth-Century Philosophers|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UZQqBgAAQBAJ |year=2012|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-134-92796-8|page=264}}&lt;/ref&gt; I. Bruce Watson states that some of these ideas are found not only in traditions within Hinduism, but also in Jainism or Buddhism, particularly those about non-violence, vegetarianism and universal love, but Gandhi's synthesis was to politicise these ideas.&lt;ref name="Watson"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Watson |first1=I.

Gandhi stated that the most important battle to fight was overcoming his own demons, fears, and insecurities. Gandhi summarised his beliefs first when he said "God is Truth". He would later change this statement to "Truth is God". Thus, ''satya'' (truth) in Gandhi's philosophy is "God".&lt;ref name="Parel2006"&gt;{{cite book|author=Parel, Anthony |title=Gandhi's Philosophy and the Quest for Harmony|url=https://books.google.com/?id=MQhz0fW0HZUC&amp;pg=PA195|access-date=13 January 2012|year=2006|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-86715-3|page=195}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gandhi, states Richards, described the term "God" not as a separate power, but as the Being (Brahman, Atman) of the [[Advaita Vedanta]] tradition, a nondual universal that pervades in all things, in each person and all life.&lt;ref name=richards1/&gt; According to Nicholas Gier, this to Gandhi meant the unity of God and humans, that all beings have the same one soul and therefore equality, that ''atman'' exists and is same as everything in the universe, ahimsa (non-violence) is the very nature of this ''atman''.&lt;ref name=gier40&gt;{{cite book|author=Nicholas F.

The essence of [[Satyagraha]] is "soul force" as a political means, refusing to use brute force against the oppressor, seeking to eliminate antagonisms between the oppressor and the oppressed, aiming to transform or "purify" the oppressor. It is not inaction but determined passive resistance and non-co-operation where, states Arthur Herman, "love conquers hate".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Arthur Herman|title=Gandhi &amp; Churchill: The Epic Rivalry that Destroyed an Empire and Forged Our Age|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tquxD6dk914C&amp;pg=PA176 |year=2008|publisher=Random House |isbn=978-0-553-90504-5|page=176}}&lt;/ref&gt; A euphemism sometimes used for Satyagraha is that it is a "silent force" or a "soul force" (a term also used by Martin Luther King Jr. during his famous "[[I Have a Dream]]" speech). It arms the individual with moral power rather than physical power. Satyagraha is also termed a "universal force", as it essentially "makes no distinction between kinsmen and strangers, young and old, man and woman, friend and foe."&lt;ref name="rules"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Gandhi | first1 = M.K. | title = Some Rules of Satyagraha ''Young India (Navajivan)'' 23 February 1930 | journal = The Collected Works of Mahatma Gandhi | volume = 48 | page = 340 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gandhi wrote: "There must be no impatience, no barbarity, no insolence, no undue pressure. If we want to cultivate a true spirit of democracy, we cannot afford to be intolerant.

While Gandhi's idea of ''satyagraha'' as a political means attracted a widespread following among Indians, the support was not universal. For example, Muslim leaders such as Jinnah opposed the ''satyagraha'' idea, accused Gandhi to be reviving Hinduism through political activism, and began effort to counter Gandhi with Muslim nationalism and a demand for Muslim homeland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=R.

====Nonviolence====
[[File:Gandhi at Darwen with women.jpg|thumb|Gandhi with textile workers at [[Darwen]], Lancashire, 26 September 1931]]

Although Gandhi was not the originator of the principle of nonviolence, he was the first to apply it in the political field on a large scale.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last =Asirvatham|first =Eddy|title =Political Theory|publisher=S.chand|isbn=81-219-0346-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept of nonviolence (''[[ahimsa]]'') has a long history in Indian religious thought, with it being considered the highest dharma (ethical value virtue), a precept to be observed towards all living beings (''sarvbhuta''), at all times (''sarvada''), in all respects (''sarvatha''), in action, words and thought.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Christopher Chapple|title=Nonviolence to Animals, Earth, and Self in Asian Traditions|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_Y00Q0_mOkAC |year=1993|publisher=State University of New York Press|isbn=978-0-7914-1497-2|pages=16–18, 54–57}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gandhi explains his philosophy and ideas about ''ahimsa'' as a political means in his autobiography ''[[The Story of My Experiments with Truth]]''.&lt;ref name="Borman1986"&gt;{{Citation| last = Gandhi | first = Mohandis K. | date = 11 August 1920| journal = Young India | publisher = M.

Gandhi was criticised for refusing to protest the hanging of [[Bhagat Singh]], [[Sukhdev]], [[Udham Singh]] and [[Rajguru]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kamat.com/mmgandhi/onbhagatsingh.htm Mahatma Gandhi on Bhagat Singh].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Rai"&gt;{{cite book|last=Rai|first=Raghunath|title=Themes in Indian History|url=https://books.google.com/?id=zYhgvAsKGLsC&amp;pg=PA282|publisher=FK Publications|page=282|isbn=9788189611620}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was accused of accepting a deal with the King's representative Irwin that released civil disobedience leaders from prison and accepted the death sentence against the highly popular revolutionary Bhagat Singh, who at his trial had replied, "Revolution is the inalienable right of mankind".&lt;ref name=ghose199&gt;{{cite book|author=Sankar Ghose|title=Mahatma Gandhi|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5l0BPnxN1h8C |year=1991|publisher=Allied Publishers|isbn=978-81-7023-205-6|pages=199–204}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gandhi's views came under heavy criticism in Britain when it was under attack from [[Nazi Germany]], and later when the [[Holocaust]] was revealed. He told the British people in 1940, "I would like you to lay down the arms you have as being useless for saving you or humanity. You will invite Herr [[Hitler]] and Signor [[Mussolini]] to take what they want of the countries you call your possessions... If these gentlemen choose to occupy your homes, you will vacate them. If they do not give you free passage out, you will allow yourselves, man, woman, and child, to be slaughtered, but you will refuse to owe allegiance to them."&lt;ref name="Wolpert2002"&gt;[[#Wolpert|Wolpert]], p. 197.&lt;/ref&gt; [[George Orwell]] remarked that Gandhi's methods confronted 'an old-fashioned and rather shaky despotism which treated him in a fairly chivalrous way', not a totalitarian Power, 'where political opponents simply disappear.'&lt;ref&gt;Orwell, review of [[Louis Fischer]]'s ''Gandhi and Stalin'', ''The Observer'', 10 October 1948, reprinted in ''It Is what I Think'', pp. 452–453.&lt;/ref&gt;

In a post-war interview in 1946, he said, "Hitler killed five million [[Jews]]. It is the greatest crime of our time. But the Jews should have offered themselves to the butcher's knife. They should have thrown themselves into the sea from cliffs... It would have aroused the world and the people of Germany... As it is they succumbed anyway in their millions."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|year=1950|title = The life of Mahatma Gandhi|author=Fischer, Louis|publisher=Harper|page=348|url=https://books.google.com/?id=pHcGAQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA348}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gandhi believed this act of "collective suicide", in response to the Holocaust, "would have been heroism".&lt;ref&gt;George Orwell, "Reflections on Gandhi", ''Partisan Review'', January 1949.&lt;/ref&gt;

===On inter-religious relations===
====Buddhists, Jains and Sikhs====
Gandhi believed that Buddhism, Jainism and Sikhism were traditions of Hinduism, with shared history, rites and ideas. At other times, he acknowledged that he knew little about Buddhism other than his reading of [[Edwin Arnold]]'s book on it. Based on that book, he considered Buddhism to be a reform movement and the Buddha to be a Hindu.&lt;ref name="Jordens1998p107"/&gt; He stated he knew Jainism much more, and he credited Jains to have profoundly influenced him. Sikhism, to Gandhi, was an integral part of Hinduism, in the form of another reform movement. Sikh and Buddhist leaders disagreed with Gandhi, a disagreement Gandhi respected as a difference of opinion.&lt;ref name="Jordens1998p107"&gt;{{cite book|author=J.T.F. Jordens|title=Gandhi's Religion: A Homespun Shawl|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ELODDAAAQBAJ |year=1998|publisher=New York: Palgrave Macmillan|isbn=978-0-230-37389-1|pages=107–108}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Nikky-Guninder Kaur Singh|editor=Harold Coward|title=Indian Critiques of Gandhi|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=t5iQbjXgA0cC |year=2003|publisher=State University of New York Press|isbn=978-0-7914-8588-0|pages=185–188}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Jews====
According to Kumaraswamy, Gandhi initially supported Arab demands with respect to Palestine. He justified this support by invoking Islam, stating that "non-Muslims cannot acquire sovereign jurisdiction" in ''Jazirat al-Arab'' (Arabian Peninsula).&lt;ref name="Kumaraswamy2010p36"/&gt; These arguments, states Kumaraswamy, were a part of his political strategy to win Muslim support during the [[Khilafat Movement#Khilafat Movement in South Asia|Khilafat movement]]. In post-Khilafat period, Gandhi neither negated Jewish demands nor did he use Islamic texts or history to support Muslim claims against Israel. Gandhi's silence after the Khilafat period may represent an evolution in his understanding of the conflicting religious claims over Palestine, according to Kumaraswamy.&lt;ref name="Kumaraswamy2010p36"/&gt; In 1938, Gandhi spoke in favour of Jewish claims. In March 1946, he said to the Member of British Parliament [[Sidney Silverman]], "if the Arabs have a claim to Palestine, the Jews have a prior claim", a position very different from his earlier stance.&lt;ref name="Kumaraswamy2010p36"&gt;{{cite book|author=P. R. Kumaraswamy|title=India's Israel Policy|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=5EHJHVXmLeEC |year= 2010|publisher= Columbia University Press|isbn=978-0-231-52548-0|pages=36–38}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Fischer Louis|title=The life of Mahatma Gandhi|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=8qwqAAAAYAAJ|year= 1950|publisher= HarperCollins|isbn=978-0-06-091038-9|page=424}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gandhi discussed the [[History of the Jews in Germany#Jews under the Nazis (1933–1939)|persecution of the Jews in Germany]] and the [[Aliyah#Zionist Aliyah (1882 on)|emigration of Jews from Europe to Palestine]] through his lens of [[Satyagraha]].&lt;ref name=gs/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Panter-Brick, Simone (2008), ''Gandhi and the Middle East: Jews, Arabs and Imperial Interests''. London: [[I.B. Tauris]], {{ISBN|1845115848}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1937, Gandhi discussed [[Zionism]] with his close Jewish friend Hermann Kallenbach.&lt;ref name=dream&gt;Panter-Brick, Simone. [http://www.dur.ac.uk/anthropology.journal/vol16/iss2/panter-brick.pdf "Gandhi's Dream of Hindu-Muslim Unity and its two Offshoots in the Middle East"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120717192928/http://www.dur.ac.uk/anthropology.journal/vol16/iss2/panter-brick.pdf |date=17 July 2012 }}. ''Durham Anthropology Journal'', Volume 16(2), 2009: pp. 54–66.&lt;/ref&gt; He said that Zionism was not the right answer to the problems faced by Jews&lt;ref name=Jack&gt;[[#Jack|Jack]], p. 317.&lt;/ref&gt; and instead recommended Satyagraha. Gandhi thought the Zionists in Palestine represented European imperialism and used violence to achieve their goals; he argued that "the Jews should disclaim any intention of realizing their aspiration under the protection of arms and should rely wholly on the goodwill of Arabs. No exception can possibly be taken to the natural desire of the Jews to find a home in Palestine. But they must wait for its fulfillment till Arab opinion is ripe for it."&lt;ref name=gs/&gt;

In 1938, Gandhi stated that his "sympathies are all with the Jews. I have known them intimately in South Africa. Some of them became life-long companions." Philosopher [[Martin Buber]] was highly critical of Gandhi's approach and in 1939 wrote an open letter to him on the subject. Gandhi reiterated his stance that "the Jews seek to convert the Arab heart", and use "''satyagraha'' in confronting the Arabs" in 1947.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Murti, Ramana V.V. |title=Buber's Dialogue and Gandhi's Satyagraha|journal=Journal of the History of Ideas|volume= 29|issue=4 |year=1968|pages=605–13|jstor=2708297|doi=10.2307/2708297}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Simone Panter-Brick, Gandhi's political position on Jewish-Arab conflict evolved over the 1917-1947 period, shifting from a support for the Arab position first, and for the Jewish position in the 1940s.&lt;ref&gt;Simone Panter-Brick (2009), [https://www.jstor.org/stable/40262646 Gandhi's Views on the Resolution of the Conflict in Palestine: A Note], Middle Eastern Studies, Taylor &amp; Francis, Vol. 45, No. 1 (Jan. 2009), pp. 127–133&lt;/ref&gt;

====Christians====
Gandhi criticised as well as praised Christianity. He was critical of Christian missionary efforts in British India, because they mixed medical or education assistance with demands that the beneficiary convert to Christianity.&lt;ref name="Bauman2015p56"/&gt; According to Gandhi, this was not true "service" but one driven by ulterior motive of luring people into religious conversion and exploiting the economically or medically desperate. It did not lead to inner transformation or moral advance or to the Christian teaching of "love", but was based on false one-sided criticisms of other religions, when Christian societies faced similar problems in South Africa and Europe. It led to the converted person hating his neighbours and others religions, it divided people rather than bringing them closer in compassion. According to Gandhi, "no religious tradition could claim a monopoly over truth or salvation".&lt;ref name="Bauman2015p56"&gt;{{cite book|author=Chad M. Bauman|title= Pentecostals, Proselytization, and Anti-Christian Violence in Contemporary India |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Mg6aBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA56 |year=2015|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-020210-1|pages=50, 56–59, 66}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Robert Eric Frykenberg|author2=Richard Fox Young|title=India and the Indianness of Christianity|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=Jgubl3CQQDgC&amp;pg=PA211 |year=2009|publisher=Wm. B. Eerdmans|isbn=978-0-8028-6392-8|pages=211–214}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gandhi did not support laws to prohibit missionary activity, but demanded that Christians should first understand the message of Jesus, and then strive to live without stereotyping and misrepresenting other religions. According to Gandhi, the message of Jesus wasn't to humiliate and imperialistically rule over other people considering them inferior or second class or slaves, but that "when the hungry are fed and peace comes to our individual and collective life, then Christ is born".&lt;ref name=coward81&gt;{{cite book|editor=Harold Coward|title=Hindu-Christian Dialogue: Perspectives and Encounters|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6eHgNyNimoAC|author=John C.B.

Gandhi believed that his long acquaintance with Christianity had made him like it as well as find it imperfect. He asked Christians to stop humiliating his country and his people as heathens, idolators and other abusive language, and to change their negative views of India. He believed that Christians should introspect on the "true meaning of religion" and get a desire to study and learn from Indian religions in the spirit of universal brotherhood.&lt;ref name=coward81/&gt; According to [[Eric J.

====Muslims====
Gandhi believed there were material contradictions between Hinduism and Islam, and he shared his thoughts on the Quran and Muslims many times.&lt;ref name=nagler17/&gt; He stated in 1925, for example, that he had not criticised the teachings of the Quran, but he did criticise the interpreters of Quran. Gandhi believed that numerous interpreters have interpreted it to fit their preconceived notions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=M K Gandhi|title=Young India|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1XfjAAAAMAAJ|year=1925|publisher=Navajivan Publishing|pages=81–82}}&lt;/ref&gt; He believed Muslims should welcome criticism of Quran, because "every true scripture only gains from criticism". Gandhi criticised Muslims who "betray intolerance of criticism by a non-Muslim of anything related to Islam", such as the penalty of stoning to death under Islamic law. To Gandhi, Islam has "nothing to fear from criticism even if it be unreasonable".&lt;ref name="Gandhi2004p193"&gt;{{cite book|author=Mohandas Karmchand Gandhi|editor=V Geetha|title=Soul Force: Gandhi's Writings on Peace |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Wwkt5TX623UC|year=2004|publisher=Gandhi Publications Trust |isbn=978-81-86211-85-4|pages=193–194}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nagler17&gt;{{cite book|author1=Mohandas K.

One of the strategies Gandhi adopted was to work with Muslim leaders of pre-partition India, to oppose the British imperialism in and outside the Indian subcontinent.&lt;ref name=paine20&gt;{{cite book|author=Sarah C.M. Paine|title=Nation Building, State Building, and Economic Development: Case Studies and Comparisons|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cJ9sBgAAQBAJ |year=2015|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-317-46409-9|pages=20–21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ghosep161/&gt; After the World War I, in 1919–22, he won Muslim leadership support of Ali Brothers by backing the [[Khilafat Movement]] in favour the Islamic Caliph and his historic [[Ottoman Caliphate]], and opposing the secular Islam supporting [[Mustafa Kemal Atatürk]]. By 1924, Ataturk had ended the Caliphate, the Khilafat Movement was over, and Muslim support for Gandhi had largely evaporated.&lt;ref name=paine20/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kumaraswamy | first1 = P.

In 1925, Gandhi gave another reason to why he got involved in the Khilafat movement and the Middle East affairs between Britain and the Ottoman Empire. Gandhi explained to his co-religionists (Hindu) that he sympathised and campaigned for the Islamic cause, not because he cared for the Sultan, but because "I wanted to enlist the Mussalman's sympathy in the matter of cow protection".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Simone Panter-Brick|title=Gandhi and Nationalism: The Path to Indian Independence |year=2015 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=-aIcBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA118 |publisher=I.B.Tauris |isbn=978-1-78453-023-5|pages=118–119}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the historian M. Naeem Qureshi, like the then Indian Muslim leaders who had combined religion and politics, Gandhi too imported his religion into his political strategy during the Khilafat movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=M.

In the 1940s, Gandhi pooled ideas with some Muslim leaders who sought religious harmony like him, and opposed the proposed partition of British India into India and Pakistan. For example, his close friend [[Khan Abdul Ghaffar Khan|Badshah Khan]] suggested that they should work towards opening Hindu temples for Muslim prayers, and Islamic mosques for Hindu prayers, to bring the two religious groups closer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Muhammad Soaleh Korejo|title=The Frontier Gandhi: His Place in History|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JGduAAAAMAAJ|year=1993|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-577461-0|pages=77–79}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gandhi accepted this and began having Muslim prayers read in Hindu temples to play his part, but was unable to get Hindu prayers read in mosques. The Hindu nationalist groups objected and began confronting Gandhi for this one-sided practice, by shouting and demonstrating inside the Hindu temples, in the last years of his life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Stanley Wolpert|title=Gandhi's Passion: The Life and Legacy of Mahatma Gandhi|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ih1VCqkUr4gC|year=2001|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-972872-5|pages=243–244}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=godse1948/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Rein Fernhout|editor=ʻAbd Allāh Aḥmad Naʻim, Jerald Gort and Henry Jansen|title=Human Rights and Religious Values: An Uneasy Relationship?|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=plEEQnaDGYYC&amp;pg=PA126 |year= 1995|publisher= Rodopi|isbn= 978-9-05-183777-3|pages=126–131}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Sufism=====
Gandhi was acquainted with the Sufi Islam's [[Chishti Order]], which he discovered during his stay in South Africa. He attended [[Khanqah]] gatherings there at Riverside. According to Margaret Chatterjee, Gandhi as a Vaishnava Hindu shared values such as humility, devotion and brotherhood for the poor that is also found in Sufism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Chatterjee|first=Margaret|title=Gandhi and the Challenge of Religious Diversity: Religious Pluralism Revisited|date=2005|publisher=Bibliophile South Asia|isbn=9788185002460|page=119|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_06rcmT0b7UC&amp;pg=PA119|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Fiala|first=Andrew|title=The Routledge Handbook of Pacifism and Nonviolence|date=2018|publisher=[[Routledge]]|isbn=9781317271970|page=94|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Y35KDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT94|language=en}}, Fiala quotes Ambitabh Pal, "Gandhi himself followed a strand of Hinduism that with its emphasis on service and on poetry and songs bore similarities to Sufi Islam".&lt;/ref&gt;

===On life, society and other application of his ideas===
====Vegetarianism, food, and animals====
Gandhi was brought up as a vegetarian by his devout Hindu mother.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Stanley Wolpert|title=Gandhi's Passion: The Life and Legacy of Mahatma Gandhi|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KpBy6BCupe4C|year=2002|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-515634-8|pages=14, 25–27|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170219190635/https://books.google.com/books?id=KpBy6BCupe4C|archivedate=19 February 2017|df=dmy-all}}, Quote: "The Gandhis had always been strict vegetarians, as are all devout Hindus".&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=kemmerer65/&gt; The idea of vegetarianism is deeply ingrained in [[Hindu]] Vaishnavism and [[Jain]] traditions in India, such as in his native Gujarat, where meat is considered as a form of food obtained by violence to animals.&lt;ref name="Tahtinen1979p62"&gt;{{cite book|author=Unto Tähtinen|title=The Core of Gandhi's Philosophy |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gPk72b6A8yYC&amp;pg=PA61 |year=1979|publisher=Abhinav Publications|isbn=978-0-8364-0516-3|pages=61–62, 51–52}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Chitrita Banerji, ''Eating India: an odyssey into the food and culture of the land of spices'' (2007), p. 169.&lt;/ref&gt; Gandhi's rationale for vegetarianism was largely along those found in Hindu and Jain texts. Gandhi believed that any form of food inescapably harms some form of living organism, but one should seek to understand and reduce the violence in what one consumes because "there is essential unity of all life".&lt;ref name=kemmerer65&gt;{{cite book|author=Lisa Kemmerer|title=Animals and World Religions|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JowVDAAAQBAJ |year=2012|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-979068-5|pages=65–68}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=terchek204/&gt;

Gandhi believed that some life forms are more capable of suffering, and non-violence to him meant not having the intent as well as active efforts to minimise hurt, injury or suffering to all life forms.&lt;ref name=terchek204&gt;{{cite book|author=Ronald Terchek|title=Gandhi: Struggling for Autonomy|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=hg1MqCeW7OUC |year= 1998|publisher= Rowman &amp; Littlefield|isbn= 978-0-8476-9215-6|pages=204–206}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gandhi explored food sources that reduced violence to various life forms in the food chain. He believed that slaughtering animals is unnecessary, as other sources of foods are available.&lt;ref name="Tahtinen1979p62"/&gt; He also consulted with vegetarianism campaigners during his lifetime, such as with [[Henry Stephens Salt]]. Food to Gandhi was not only a source of sustaining one's body, but a source of his impact on other living beings, and one that affected his mind, character and spiritual well being.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Becker, Carol|title=Gandhi's Body and Further Representations of War and Peace|journal=Art Journal|volume= 65|issue=4 |year=2006 |page= 78|doi=10.2307/20068500}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Joseph S.

Gandhi wrote the book ''The Moral Basis of Vegetarianism'' and wrote for the London Vegetarian Society's publication.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Wolpert|Wolpert]], p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt;

Beyond his religious beliefs, Gandhi stated another motivation for his experiments with diet. He attempted to find the most non-violent vegetarian meal that the poorest human could afford, taking meticulous notes on vegetables and fruits, and his observations with his own body and his ''ashram'' in Gujarat.&lt;ref name=herman89/&gt;&lt;ref name=gandhi328/&gt; He tried fresh and dry fruits ([[Fruitarianism]]), then just sun dried fruits, before resuming his prior vegetarian diet on advice of his doctor and concerns of his friends.

He believed that each vegetarian should experiment with his or her diet because, in his studies at his ''ashram'' he saw "one man's food may be poison for another".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Joseph S.

Gandhi championed animal rights in general. Other than making vegetarian choices, he actively campaigned against dissection studies and experimentation on live animals ([[vivisection]]) in the name of science and medical studies.&lt;ref name="Tahtinen1979p62"/&gt; He considered it a violence against animals, something that inflicted pain and suffering. He wrote, "Vivisection in my opinion is the blackest of all the blackest crimes that man is at present committing against god and his fair creation."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mkgandhi.org/articles/views_on_sci.htm |title=Towards an understanding of Gandhi's views on Science |publisher=Mkgandhi.org |date=1 November 1934 |accessdate=12 July 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160311184704/http://www.mkgandhi.org/articles/views_on_sci.htm |archivedate=11 March 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Fasting====
{{See also|List of fasts undertaken by Mahatma Gandhi}}
[[File:Gandhi fasting 1948.jpg|thumb|Gandhi's last political protest using fasting, in January 1948]]

Gandhi used [[fasting]] as a political device, often threatening suicide unless demands were met. Congress publicised the fasts as a political action that generated widespread sympathy. In response the government tried to manipulate news coverage to minimise his challenge to the Raj. He fasted in 1932 to protest the voting scheme for separate political representation for Dalits; Gandhi did not want them segregated. The British government stopped the London press from showing photographs of his emaciated body, because it would elicit sympathy. Gandhi's 1943 hunger strike took place during a two-year prison term for the anticolonial Quit India movement. The government called on nutritional experts to demystify his action, and again no photos were allowed. However, his final fast in 1948, after the end of British rule in India, his hunger strike was lauded by the British press and this time did include full-length photos.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Pratt, Tim  |author2=Vernon, James  |lastauthoramp=yes |doi=10.1086/424944|title='Appeal from this fiery bed...': The Colonial Politics of Gandhi's Fasts and Their Metropolitan Reception|journal=Journal of British Studies|year=2005|volume=44|issue=1|pages=92–114}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alter states that Gandhi's fasting, vegetarianism and diet was more than a political leverage, it was a part of his experiments with self restraint and healthy living. He was "profoundly skeptical of traditional Ayurveda", encouraging it to study the scientific method and adopt its progressive learning approach. Gandhi believed yoga offered health benefits. He believed that a healthy nutritional diet based on regional foods and hygiene were essential to good health.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Alter, Joseph S. |title=Gandhi's body, Gandhi's truth: Nonviolence and the biomoral imperative of public health|journal=Journal of Asian Studies|year=1996|volume=35|issue=2|pages=305–306, 309–310, 313–317, 320–321 (all with footnotes)|jstor= 2943361| doi= 10.2307/2943361}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Women====
Gandhi strongly favoured the emancipation of women, and urged "the women to fight for their own self-development." He opposed ''[[purdah]]'', [[child marriage]], [[dowry]] and ''[[sati (practice)|sati]]''.&lt;ref name="Norvell1997"/&gt; A wife is not a slave of the husband, stated Gandhi, but his comrade, better half, colleague and friend, according to Lyn Norvell.&lt;ref name="Norvell1997"/&gt; In his own life however, according to Suruchi Thapar-Bjorkert, Gandhi's relationship with his wife were at odds with some of these values.&lt;ref name=suruchi77/&gt;

At various occasions, Gandhi credited his orthodox Hindu mother, and his wife, for first lessons in ''satyagraha''.&lt;ref name="Kishwar2008p132"&gt;{{cite book|author=Madhu Purnima Kishwar|title=Zealous Reformers, Deadly Laws|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5rSGAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA132 |year=2008 |publisher=SAGE Publications|isbn=978-81-321-0009-6|pages=132–133}}&lt;/ref&gt; He used the legends of Hindu goddess [[Sita]] to expound women's innate strength, autonomy and "lioness in spirit" whose moral compass can make any demon "as helpless as a goat".&lt;ref name="Kishwar2008p132"/&gt; To Gandhi, the women of India were an important part of the "swadeshi movement" (Buy Indian), and his goal of decolonising the Indian economy.&lt;ref name="Kishwar2008p132"/&gt;

Some historians such as Angela Woollacott and Kumari Jayawardena state that even though Gandhi often and publicly expressed his belief in the equality of sexes, yet his vision was one of gender difference and complementarity between them. Women, to Gandhi, should be educated to be better in the domestic realm and educate the next generation. His views on women's right were less liberal and more similar to puritan-Victorian expectations of women, states Jayawardena, than other Hindu leaders with him who supported economic independence and equal gender rights in all aspects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Angela Woollacott|title=Gender and Empire|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=S5YcBQAAQBAJ |year=2006|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|isbn=978-0-230-20485-0|pages=107–108}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Kumari Jayawardena|title=Feminism and Nationalism in the Third World|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Vj_OCgAAQBAJ|year=2016|publisher=Verso|isbn=978-1-78478-431-7|pages=95–99}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Brahmacharya: abstinence from sex and food====
Along with many other texts, Gandhi studied ''Bhagavad Gita'' while in South Africa.&lt;ref name="apsharma154"&gt;{{cite book|author=A. P. Sharma|title=Indian &amp; Western Educational Philosophy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2o4bTpFQtdIC |year=2010|publisher=Pustak Mahal|isbn=81-7806-201-1|pages=154–156}}&lt;/ref&gt; This Hindu scripture discusses [[jnana yoga]], [[bhakti yoga]] and [[karma yoga]] along with virtues such as non-violence, patience, integrity, lack of hypocrisy, self restraint and abstinence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Winthrop Sargeant|editor=Christopher Key Chapple|title=The Bhagavad Gita: Twenty-fifth–Anniversary Edition|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=COuy5CDAqt4C|year=2010|publisher=State University of New York Press|isbn=978-1-4384-2840-6|pages=x–xviii, 285 (verse 6.14), 415 (verse 10.5), 535 (verse 13.7)|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170415012931/https://books.google.com/books?id=COuy5CDAqt4C|archivedate=15 April 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gandhi began experiments with these, and in 1906 at age 37, although married and a father, he vowed to abstain from sexual relations.&lt;ref name="apsharma154"/&gt;

Gandhi's experiment with abstinence went beyond sex, and extended to food. He consulted the [[Jain]] scholar Rajchandra, whom he fondly called Raychandbhai.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Thomas Weber|title=Gandhi as Disciple and Mentor |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=P8nC80pG4GIC&amp;pg=PA33 |year=2004|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-1-139-45657-9|page=33}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rajchandra advised him that milk stimulated sexual passion.

Gandhi tried to test and prove to himself his ''brahmacharya''. The experiments began some time after the death of his wife in February 1944. At the start of his experiment he had women sleep in the same room but in different beds. He later slept with women in the same bed but clothed, and finally he slept naked with women. In April 1945, Gandhi referenced being naked with several "women or girls" in a letter to Birla as part of the experiments.&lt;ref name=parekh210&gt;{{cite book|author=Bhikhu C.

According to Sean Scalmer, Gandhi in his final year of life was an ascetic, looked ugly and a sickly skeletal figure, already caricatured in the Western media.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Sean Scalmer|title=Gandhi in the West: The Mahatma and the Rise of Radical Protest|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oDcXJxRR4TUC&amp;pg=PA16|year=2011|publisher=Cambridge University Press|pages=12–17 with footnotes|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160101071616/https://books.google.com/books?id=oDcXJxRR4TUC&amp;pg=PA16|archivedate=1 January 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In February 1947, he asked his confidants such as Birla and Ramakrishna if it was wrong for him to experiment his ''brahmacharya'' oath.&lt;ref name=ghose354/&gt; Gandhi's public experiments, as they progressed, were widely discussed and criticised by his family members and leading politicians. However, Gandhi said that if he would not let Manu sleep with him, it would be a sign of weakness.

====Untouchability and castes====
Gandhi spoke out against untouchability early in his life.&lt;ref name="Jaffrelotp62"&gt;{{cite book|author=Christophe Jaffrelot|title=Dr. Ambedkar and Untouchability: Fighting the Indian Caste System|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=W1590ts70g0C&amp;pg=PA60|year=2005|publisher=Columbia University Press|isbn=978-0-231-13602-0|pages=60–63}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before 1932, he and his colleagues used the term ''Antyaja'' for untouchables. One of the major speeches he made on untouchability was at [[Nagpur]] in 1920, where he called untouchability as a great evil in Hindu society. In his remarks, he stated that the phenomena of untouchability is not unique to the Hindu society, but has deeper roots because Europeans in South Africa treat "all of us, Hindus and Muslims, as untouchables; we may not reside in their midst, nor enjoy the rights which they do".&lt;ref name=gandhi149/&gt; He called it intolerable. He stated this practice can be eradicated, Hinduism is flexible to allow this, and a concerted effort is needed to persuade it is wrong and by all to eradicate it.&lt;ref name=gandhi149/&gt;

According to Christophe Jaffrelot, while Gandhi considered untouchability to be wrong and evil, he believed that caste or class are based neither on inequality nor on inferiority.&lt;ref name="Jaffrelotp62"/&gt; Gandhi believed that individuals should freely intermarry whoever they want to, but no one should expect everyone to befriend them. Every individual regardless of his or her background, stated Gandhi, has a right to choose who they welcome into their home, who they befriend and who they spend time with.&lt;ref name="Jaffrelotp62"/&gt;&lt;ref name=gandhi149&gt;MK Gandhi (1920), [https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.164029/2015.164029.The-Collected-Works-Of-Mahatma-Gandhi-Xix-November-1920--April-1921#page/n163/mode/2up Speech at Antyaj Conference], Nagpur, pages 148–155&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1932, Gandhi began a new campaign to improve the lives of the untouchables, whom he started referring to as [[Harijan]]s or "the children of god".&lt;ref name="Coward2003"/&gt; On 8 May 1933, Gandhi began a 21-day fast of self-purification and launched a one-year campaign to help the Harijan movement.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Desai|Desai]], pp. 230–89.&lt;/ref&gt; This new campaign was not universally embraced within the [[Dalit (outcaste)|Dalit]] community. Ambedkar and his allies felt Gandhi was being paternalistic and was undermining Dalit political rights. Ambedkar described him as "devious and untrustworthy".&lt;ref name="GreatSoulReview"/&gt; He accused Gandhi as someone who wished to retain the caste system.&lt;ref name="Dirks2011p267"/&gt; Ambedkar and Gandhi debated their ideas and concerns, where both tried to persuade each other.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mkgandhi.org/Selected%20Letters/amb-gandhi%20corr..htm Gandhi-Ambedkar correspondence] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170109182842/http://www.mkgandhi.org/Selected%20Letters/amb-gandhi%20corr..htm |date=9 January 2017 }}, Mahatma Gandhi writings, An Archive&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Rajmohan Gandhi|title=Gandhi: The Man, His People, and the Empire|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FauJL7LKXmkC|year=2006|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-25570-8|pages=333–359|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170222104043/https://books.google.com/books?id=FauJL7LKXmkC|archivedate=22 February 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1935, Ambedkar announced his intentions to leave Hinduism and join Buddhism.&lt;ref name="Dirks2011p267"/&gt; According to Sankar Ghose, the announcement shook Gandhi, who reappraised his views and wrote many essays with his views on castes, inter-marriage and what Hinduism says on the subject. These views contrasted with those of Ambedkar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Sankar Ghose|title=Mahatma Gandhi |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5l0BPnxN1h8C&amp;pg=PA236 |year=1991|publisher=Allied Publishers|isbn=978-81-7023-205-6|page=236}}&lt;/ref&gt; In actual elections of 1937, except for some seats in Mumbai where Ambedkar's party won, India's untouchables voted heavily in favour of Gandhi's campaign and his party, the Congress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author= Rajmohan Gandhi|title=Gandhi: The Man, His People, and the Empire |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FauJL7LKXmkC&amp;pg=PA385 |year=2006 |publisher=University of California Press|isbn= 978-0-520-25570-8|page= 385}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gandhi and his colleagues continued to consult Ambedkar, keeping him influential. Ambedkar worked with other Congress leaders through the 1940s, wrote large parts of India's constitution in the late 1940s, and converted to Buddhism in 1956.&lt;ref name="Dirks2011p267"/&gt; According to Jaffrelot, Gandhi's views evolved between the 1920s and 1940s, when in 1946 he actively encouraged inter-marriage across castes. However, Gandhi's approach to untouchability was different than Ambedkar because Gandhi championed fusion, choice and free intermixing. Ambedkar, in contrast states Jeffrelot, envisioned each segment of society to maintain their identity group, and each group then separately advanced the "politics of equality".&lt;ref name="Jaffrelotp62"/&gt;

The criticism of Gandhi by Ambedkar continued to influence the Dalit movement past Gandhi's death. According to Arthur Herman, Ambedkar's hate for Gandhi and Gandhi's ideas was so strong that after he heard the news of Gandhi's assassination, remarked after a momentary silence a sense of regret and then "my real enemy is gone; thank goodness the eclipse is over now".&lt;ref name="Herman2008p586"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author= KR Rao|editor =MVVS Murthi et al|journal=Journal of Gandhian Studies|title = Satyagraha: Gandhi's yoga of nonviolence| volume = 3|year=1975|page=48|publisher= Gandhi Bhawan, University of Allahabad}};&lt;br&gt;Laxman Kawale (2012), ''Dalit's Social Transformation: Redefining the Social Justice'', ISRJ, Volume 1, Issue XII, page 3; Quote: "Even though Ambedkar was a party to Poona Pact, he was never reconciled to it.

On the death of Gandhi he expressed, "My real enemy has gone; thank goodness the eclipse is over". He equated the assassination of Gandhi with that of Caesar and the remark of Cicero to the messenger – "Tell the Romans, your hour of liberty has come". He further remarked, "While one regrets the assassination of Mahatma Gandhi, one cannot help finding in his heart the echo of the sentiments expressed by Cicero on the assassination of Caesar".&lt;/ref&gt; According to Ramachandra Guha, "ideologues have carried these old rivalries into the present, with the demonization of Gandhi now common among politicians who presume to speak in Ambedkar's name."&lt;ref&gt;Guha, Ramachandra (22 June 2012) [https://newrepublic.com/article/books-and-arts/magazine/104203/the-other-liberal-light "The Other Liberal Light"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151024032337/http://www.newrepublic.com/article/books-and-arts/magazine/104203/the-other-liberal-light |date=24 October 2015 }}.

====Nai Talim, basic education====
{{main|Nai Talim}}
Gandhi rejected the colonial Western format of education system. He stated that it led to disdain for manual work, generally created an elite administrative bureaucracy. Gandhi favoured an education system with far greater emphasis on learning skills in practical and useful work, one that included physical, mental and spiritual studies. His methodology sought to treat all professions equal and pay everyone the same.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=V.R. Devika and G. Arulmani|editor= Gideon Arulmani et al.|title=Handbook of Career Development: International Perspectives|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=_RS4BAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA111| year=2014|publisher= Springer Science|isbn= 978-1-4614-9460-7|page=111}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=weber80/&gt;

Gandhi called his ideas ''Nai Talim'' (literally, 'new education'). He believed that the Western style education violated and destroyed the indigenous cultures. A different basic education model, he believed, would lead to better self awareness, prepare people to treat all work equally respectable and valued, and lead to a society with less social diseases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=J.J.

Nai Talim evolved out of his experiences at the Tolstoy Farm in South Africa, and Gandhi attempted to formulate the new system at the Sevagram ashram after 1937.&lt;ref name=weber80&gt;{{cite book|author=Weber, Thomas |title=Gandhi As Disciple And Mentor|url=https://books.google.com/?id=P8nC80pG4GIC&amp;pg=PA80|year=2004|publisher=Cambridge U.

In his autobiography, Gandhi wrote that he believed every Hindu boy and girl must learn [[Sanskrit]] because its historic and spiritual texts are in that language.&lt;ref name="Childhood"/&gt;

====Swaraj, self-rule====
{{Main|Swaraj}}
Gandhi believed that ''swaraj'' not only can be attained with non-violence, it can be run with non-violence. A military is unnecessary, because any aggressor can be thrown out using the method of non-violent non-co-operation. While military is unnecessary in a nation organised under ''swaraj'' principle, Gandhi added that a police force is necessary given human nature. However, the state would limit the use of weapons by the police to the minimum, aiming for their use as a restraining force.&lt;ref name="Chakrabarty"&gt;{{cite book|author=Chakrabarty, Bidyut |title=Social and political thought of Mahatma Gandhi|url=https://books.google.com/?id=4x34We-mY40C&amp;pg=PA138|year=2006|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0-415-36096-8|pages=138–139}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Gandhi, a non-violent state is like an "ordered anarchy".&lt;ref name="Chakrabarty"/&gt; In a society of mostly non-violent individuals, those who are violent will sooner or later accept discipline or leave the community, stated Gandhi.&lt;ref name="Chakrabarty"/&gt; He emphasised a society where individuals believed more in learning about their duties and responsibilities, not demanded rights and privileges. On returning from South Africa, when Gandhi received a letter asking for his participation in writing a world charter for human rights, he responded saying, "in my experience, it is far more important to have a charter for human duties."&lt;ref&gt;[[Eknath Easwaran|Easwaran, Eknath]]. ''[[Gandhi the Man]]''. Nilgiri Press, 2011. p. 49.&lt;/ref&gt;

Swaraj to Gandhi did not mean transferring colonial era British power brokering system, favours-driven, bureaucratic, class exploitative structure and mindset into Indian hands. He warned such a transfer would still be English rule, just without the Englishman. "This is not the Swaraj I want", said Gandhi.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Gillen, Paul  |author2=Ghosh, Devleena  |lastauthoramp=yes |title=Colonialism and Modernity|url=https://books.google.com/?id=bnQk28Du5poC&amp;pg=PA130|year=2007|publisher=UNSW Press|pages=129–131|isbn=9780868407357}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Anil Mishra|title=Reading Gandhi|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Xa8cD95Mt4YC |year=2012|publisher=Pearson|isbn=978-81-317-9964-2|pages=167–170}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tewari states that Gandhi saw democracy as more than a system of government; it meant promoting both individuality and the self-discipline of the community. Democracy meant settling disputes in a nonviolent manner; it required freedom of thought and expression.

In an interview with C.F. Andrews, Gandhi stated that if we believe all religions teach the same message of love and peace between all human beings, then there is neither any rationale nor need for proselytisation or attempts to convert people from one religion to another.&lt;ref name=singh79/&gt; Gandhi opposed missionary organisations who criticised Indian religions then attempted to convert followers of Indian religions to Islam or Christianity. In Gandhi's view, those who attempt to convert a Hindu, "they must harbour in their breasts the belief that Hinduism is an error" and that their own religion is "the only true religion".&lt;ref name=singh79/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Mahatma Gandhi|author2=Anand T.

He stated that spiritual studies must encourage "a Hindu to become a better Hindu, a Mussalman to become a better Mussalman, and a Christian a better Christian."&lt;ref name=singh79&gt;{{cite journal| author1=Singh AR| author2= Singh SA| title=Gandhi on religion, faith and conversion: secular blueprint relevant today | journal=Mens Sana Monographs | year= 2004 | volume= 2 | issue= 1 | pages= 79–88 | pmid=22815610 | pmc=3400300 | url= https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/elink.fcgi?dbfrom=pubmed&amp;tool=sumsearch.org/cite&amp;retmode=ref&amp;cmd=prlinks&amp;id=22815610  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Gandhi, religion is not about what a man believes, it is about how a man lives, how he relates to other people, his conduct towards others, and one's relationship to one's conception of god.&lt;ref name=parekh82&gt;{{cite book|author=Bhikhu C.

====Gandhian economics====
{{Main|Gandhian economics}}
Gandhi believed in ''sarvodaya'' economic model, which literally means "welfare, upliftment of all".&lt;ref name=rivett1&gt;{{cite journal | last=Rivett | first=Kenneth | title=The Economic Thought of Mahatma Gandhi | journal=The British Journal of Sociology | publisher=JSTOR | volume=10 | issue=1 | year=1959 | doi=10.2307/587582 | pages=1–15}}&lt;/ref&gt; This, states Bhatt, was very different economic model than the socialism model championed and followed by free India by Nehru – India's first prime minister. To both, according to Bhatt, removing poverty and unemployment were the objective, but Gandhian economic and development approach preferred adapting technology and infrastructure to suit local situation, in contrast to Nehru's large scale, socialised state owned enterprises.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bhatt | first1 = V.

To Gandhi, the economic philosophy that aims at "greatest good for the greatest number" was fundamentally flawed, and his alternative proposal ''sarvodaya'' set its aim at "greatest good for all". He believed that the best economic system not only cared to lift the "poor, less skilled, of impoverished background" but also empowered to lift the "rich, highly skilled, of capital means and landlords". Violence against any human being, born poor or rich, is wrong believed Gandhi.&lt;ref name=rivett1/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Rothermund | first=Indira | title=The Individual and Society in Gandhi's Political Thought | journal=The Journal of Asian Studies | publisher=Cambridge University Press | volume=28 | issue=2 | year=1969 | doi=10.2307/2943005 | pages=313–320}}&lt;/ref&gt; He stated that mandate theory of majoritarian democracy shouldn't be pushed to absurd extremes, individual freedoms should never be denied, and no person should ever be made a social or economic slave to the "resolutions of majorities".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Ramjee Singh|editor=Ronald Bontekoe et al|title=Justice and Democracy: Cross-cultural Perspectives  |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZcGvAzjPSboC&amp;pg=PA233 |year=1997|publisher=University of Hawaii Press|isbn=978-0-8248-1926-2|pages=233–235}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gandhi refused to endorse the view that economic forces are best understood as "antagonistic class interests".&lt;ref name=parekh5/&gt; He argued that no man can degrade or brutalise the other without degrading and brutalising himself, that sustainable economic growth comes from service, not from exploitation. Further, believed Gandhi, that in a free nation, victims exist only when they co-operate with their oppressor, and an economic and political system that offered increasing alternatives gave power of choice to the poorest man.&lt;ref name=parekh5&gt;{{cite book|author=Bhikhu C.

While disagreeing with Nehru about socialist economic model, Gandhi also critiqued capitalism that was driven by endless wants and a materialistic view of man. This, he believed, created a vicious vested system of materialism at the cost of other human needs such as spirituality and social relationships.&lt;ref name=parekh5/&gt; To Gandhi, states Parekh, both communism and capitalism were wrong, in part because both focussed exclusively on materialistic view of man, and because the former deified the state with unlimited power of violence, while the latter deified capital. A better economic system is one which does not impoverish one's culture and spiritual pursuits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Bhikhu Parekh| authorlink = Bhikhu Parekh| title=Gandhi's Political Philosophy: A Critical Examination|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sP2wCwAAQBAJ |year=1991|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|isbn=978-1-349-12242-4|pages=133–136}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Gandhism====
{{Main|Gandhism}}
''Gandhism'' designates the ideas and principles Gandhi promoted. Of central importance is nonviolent resistance. A [[:Category:Gandhians|Gandhian]] can mean either an individual who follows, or a specific philosophy which is attributed to, Gandhism.&lt;ref name="Hardiman2001"/&gt; M. M. Sankhdher argues that Gandhism is not a systematic position in metaphysics or in political philosophy. Rather, it is a political creed, an economic doctrine, a religious outlook, a moral precept, and especially, a humanitarian world view. It is an effort not to systematise wisdom but to transform society and is based on an undying faith in the goodness of human nature.&lt;ref&gt;Sankhdher, M. M. (1972), "Gandhism: A Political Interpretation", ''Gandhi Marg'', pp. 68–74.&lt;/ref&gt; However Gandhi himself did not approve of the notion of "Gandhism", as he explained in 1936:
{{quote|There is no such thing as "Gandhism", and I do not want to leave any sect after me. I do not claim to have originated any new principle or doctrine. I have simply tried in my own way to apply the eternal truths to our daily life and problems...The opinions I have formed and the conclusions I have arrived at are not final. I may change them tomorrow. I have nothing new to teach the world. Truth and nonviolence are as old as the hills.&lt;ref&gt;Kamath, M. V. (2007), ''Gandhi, a spiritual journey'', Indus Source, {{ISBN|8188569119}}, p. 195.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Literary works==
[[File:Young India.png|thumb|upright|''Young India'', a weekly journal published by Gandhi from 1919 to 1932]]
Gandhi was a prolific writer. One of Gandhi's earliest publications, ''Hind Swaraj'', published in Gujarati in 1909, became "the intellectual blueprint" for India's independence movement. The book was translated into English the next year, with a copyright legend that read "No Rights Reserved".&lt;ref name=ie12&gt;{{cite news|title=Would Gandhi have been a Wikipedian?|url=http://www.indianexpress.com/news/would-gandhi-have-been-a-wikipedian/900506/0|access-date=26 January 2012|work=The Indian Express|date=17 January 2012|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121209021916/http://www.indianexpress.com/news/would-gandhi-have-been-a-wikipedian/900506/0|archivedate=9 December 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; For decades he edited several newspapers including ''[[Harijan]]'' in Gujarati, in [[Hindi]] and in the English language; ''[[Indian Opinion]]'' while in South Africa and, ''[[Young India]]'', in English, and Navajivan, a Gujarati monthly, on his return to India. Later, Navajivan was also published in Hindi. In addition, he wrote letters almost every day to individuals and newspapers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lifepositive.com/Spirit/masters/mahatma-gandhi/journalist.asp "Peerless Communicator"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070804022748/http://www.lifepositive.com/Spirit/masters/mahatma-gandhi/journalist.asp |date=4 August 2007 }} by V. N. Narayanan. Life Positive Plus, October–December 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

Gandhi also wrote several books including his autobiography, ''[[The Story of My Experiments with Truth]] (Gujarātī "સત્યના પ્રયોગો અથવા આત્મકથા")'', of which he bought the entire first edition to make sure it was reprinted.&lt;ref name="GreatSoulReview"/&gt; His other autobiographies included: ''Satyagraha in South Africa'' about his struggle there, ''[[Hind Swaraj or Indian Home Rule]]'', a political pamphlet, and a paraphrase in Gujarati of [[John Ruskin]]'s ''[[Unto This Last]]''.&lt;ref name="Unto this last"&gt;{{Cite book |last= Gandhi |first= M.

Gandhi's complete works were published by the Indian government under the name ''[[s:The Collected Works of Mahatma Gandhi|The Collected Works of Mahatma Gandhi]]'' in the 1960s. The writings comprise about 50,000 pages published in about a hundred volumes.

==Legacy and depictions in popular culture==

* The word ''[[Mahatma]]'', while often mistaken for Gandhi's given name in the West, is taken from the [[Sanskrit language|Sanskrit]] words ''maha'' (meaning ''Great'') and ''atma'' (meaning ''Soul''). [[Rabindranath Tagore]] is said to have accorded the title to Gandhi.&lt;ref name="Tagore1998"&gt;{{cite book|last=Tagore|first=Rabindranath|editor=Dutta, Krishna |others=Robinson, Andrew |title=Rabindranath Tagore: an anthology|date=15 December 1998|publisher=Macmillan|isbn=978-0-312-20079-4|page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his autobiography, Gandhi nevertheless explains that he never valued the title, and was often pained by it.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Desai|Desai]], p. viii.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Basu Majumdar, A.

Gandhi influenced important leaders and political movements. Leaders of the [[civil rights movement]] in the United States, including [[Martin Luther King Jr.]], [[James Lawson (American activist)|James Lawson]], and [[James Bevel]], drew from the writings of Gandhi in the development of their own theories about nonviolence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mlk-kpp01.stanford.edu/index.php/kingpapers/article/kings_trip_to_india/ |title=King's Trip to India |publisher=Mlk-kpp01.stanford.edu |access-date=24 January 2012 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090321002316/http://mlk-kpp01.stanford.edu/index.php/kingpapers/article/kings_trip_to_india/|archivedate=21 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Sidner, Sara |url=http://edition.cnn.com/2009/WORLD/asiapcf/02/17/king.anniversaryvisit/index.html |title=King moved, as father was, on trip to Gandhi's memorial |work=cnn.com Asia-Pacific |publisher=CNN |date=17 February 2009 |access-date=24 January 2012 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120414101902/http://edition.cnn.com/2009/WORLD/asiapcf/02/17/king.anniversaryvisit/index.html |archivedate=14 April 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=D'Souza, Placido P. |url=http://www.sfgate.com/opinion/openforum/article/COMMEMORATING-MARTIN-LUTHER-KING-JR-Gandhi-s-2640319.php |title=Commemorating Martin Luther King Jr.: Gandhi's influence on King |work=San Francisco Chronicle |date=20 January 2003 |access-date=24 January 2012 |archivedate=10 December 2012 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6CnR0ugJA?url=http://www.sfgate.com/opinion/openforum/article/COMMEMORATING-MARTIN-LUTHER-KING-JR-Gandhi-s-2640319.php |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; King said "Christ gave us the goals and Mahatma Gandhi the tactics."&lt;ref name="Tougas2011"&gt;{{cite book|last=Tougas|first=Shelley|title=Birmingham 1963: How a Photograph Rallied Civil Rights Support|url=https://books.google.com/?id=zzWQKHKcrOMC&amp;pg=PT12|access-date=24 January 2012|date=1 January 2011|publisher=Capstone Press|isbn=978-0-7565-4398-3|page=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; King sometimes referred to Gandhi as "the little brown saint."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Cone|first=James|title=Martin &amp; Malcolm &amp; America: A Dream Or a Nightmare|year=1992|publisher=Orbis Books|isbn=0883448246}}&lt;/ref&gt; Anti-[[History of South Africa in the Apartheid Era|apartheid]] activist and former President of South Africa, [[Nelson Mandela]], was inspired by Gandhi.&lt;ref name="Mandela-2000"&gt;[[Nelson Mandela]], [http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,993025,00.html "The Sacred Warrior: The liberator of South Africa looks at the seminal work of the liberator of India"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131005014909/http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0%2C9171%2C993025%2C00.html |date=5 October 2013 }}, ''Time'', 3 January 2000&lt;/ref&gt; Others include [[Khan Abdul Ghaffar Khan]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://progressive.org/mag_amitpalabdul |title=A pacifist uncovered- Abdul Ghaffar Khan, Pakistani pacifist |author=Pal, Amitabh |work=The Progressive |date=February 2002 |access-date=24 January 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120107183114/http://progressive.org/mag_amitpalabdul |archivedate=7 January 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Steve Biko]], and [[Aung San Suu Kyi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tribuneindia.com/2004/20040222/spectrum/book1.htm |title=An alternative Gandhi |work=The Tribune |location=India |date=22 February 2004 |access-date=12 March 2009 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090514084050/http://www.tribuneindia.com/2004/20040222/spectrum/book1.htm |archivedate=14 May 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his early years, the former [[President of South Africa]] Nelson Mandela was a follower of the nonviolent resistance philosophy of Gandhi.&lt;ref name="Mandela-2000" /&gt; Bhana and Vahed commented on these events as "Gandhi inspired succeeding generations of South African activists seeking to end White rule. This legacy connects him to Nelson Mandela...in a sense Mandela completed what Gandhi started."&lt;ref name="BhanaVahed2005"/&gt;

Gandhi's life and teachings inspired many who specifically referred to Gandhi as their mentor or who dedicated their lives to spreading Gandhi's ideas. In Europe, [[Romain Rolland]] was the first to discuss Gandhi in his 1924 book ''Mahatma Gandhi,'' and Brazilian anarchist and feminist [[Maria Lacerda de Moura]] wrote about Gandhi in her work on pacifism. In 1931, notable European physicist [[Albert Einstein]] exchanged written letters with Gandhi, and called him "a role model for the generations to come" in a letter writing about him.&lt;ref name="Albano-Müller"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gandhiserve.org/streams/einstein.html |title=Einstein on Gandhi (Einstein's letter to Gandhi – Courtesy:Saraswati Albano-Müller &amp; Notes by Einstein on Gandhi – Source: The Hebrew University of Jerusalem ) |publisher=Gandhiserve.org |date=18 October 1931 |access-date=24 January 2012 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120117104005/http://www.gandhiserve.org/streams/einstein.html |archivedate=17 January 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Einstein said of Gandhi:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Mahatma Gandhi's life achievement stands unique in political history. He has invented a completely new and humane means for the liberation war of an oppressed country, and practised it with greatest energy and devotion. The moral influence he had on the consciously thinking human being of the entire civilised world will probably be much more lasting than it seems in our time with its overestimation of brutal violent forces. Because lasting will only be the work of such statesmen who wake up and strengthen the moral power of their people through their example and educational works. We may all be happy and grateful that destiny gifted us with such an enlightened contemporary, a role model for the generations to come.

Generations to come will scarce believe that such a one as this walked the earth in flesh and blood.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Lanza del Vasto]] went to India in 1936 intending to live with Gandhi; he later returned to Europe to spread Gandhi's philosophy and founded the [[Community of the Ark]] in 1948 (modelled after Gandhi's ashrams). [[Madeleine Slade]] (known as "Mirabehn") was the daughter of a British admiral who spent much of her adult life in India as a devotee of Gandhi.&lt;ref name="Dhupelia-Mesthrie2005"&gt;{{cite book|last=Dhupelia-Mesthrie|first=Uma|title=Gandhi's prisoner?: the life of Gandhi's son Manilal|url=https://books.google.com/?id=hCR0AJx-9pwC&amp;pg=PA293|access-date=26 January 2012|date=1 January 2005|publisher=Permanent Black|isbn=978-81-7824-116-6|page=293}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=In the company of Bapu|url=http://www.telegraphindia.com/1041003/asp/look/story_3824566.asp|date=3 October 2004|work=[[The Telegraph (Calcutta)|The Telegraph]]|access-date=26 January 2012|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120208170605/http://www.telegraphindia.com/1041003/asp/look/story_3824566.asp|archivedate=8 February 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

US President [[Barack Obama]] in a 2010 address to the [[Parliament of India]] said that:

Obama in September 2009 said that his biggest inspiration came from Gandhi. His reply was in response to the question 'Who was the one person, dead or live, that you would choose to dine with?'.

He ended up doing so much and changed the world just by the power of his ethics."&lt;ref name="Wakefield"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/32723625/ns/politics-white_house/t/obama-steers-clear-politics-school-pep-talk |title=Obama steers clear of politics in school pep talk |agency=Associated Press |date=8 September 2009 |publisher=MSNBC |access-date=24 January 2012 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131004223415/http://www.nbcnews.com/id/32723625/ns/politics-white_house/t/obama-steers-clear-politics-school-pep-talk/ |archivedate=4 October 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

That year, the committee chose not to award the peace prize stating that "there was no suitable living candidate" and later research shows that the possibility of awarding the prize posthumously to Gandhi was discussed and that the reference to no suitable living candidate was to Gandhi.&lt;ref name="Tønnesson"/&gt; Geir Lundestad, Secretary of Norwegian Nobel Committee in 2006 said, "The greatest omission in our 106-year history is undoubtedly that Mahatma Gandhi never received the Nobel Peace prize.

Anti-Gandhi themes have also been showcased through films and plays. The 1995 Marathi play ''Gandhi Virudh Gandhi'' explored the relationship between Gandhi and his son Harilal. The 2007 film, ''[[Gandhi, My Father]]'' was inspired on the same theme. The 1989 Marathi play ''[[Me Nathuram Godse Boltoy]]'' and the 1997 Hindi play ''Gandhi Ambedkar'' criticised Gandhi and his principles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.dnaindia.com/opinion/4153/report-its-fashionable-to-be-anti-gandhi | title=It's fashionable to be anti-Gandhi | publisher=DNA | date=1 October 2005 | access-date=25 January 2013 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130622050823/http://www.dnaindia.com/opinion/4153/report-its-fashionable-to-be-anti-gandhi | archivedate=22 June 2013 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.livemint.com/Leisure/Id8PjapDYFoJqUkyzJvG7N/Drama-king.html | title=Drama king | work=[[Mint (newspaper)|Live Mint]] | date=20 February 2009 | access-date=25 January 2013 | author=Dutt, Devina | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130430154736/http://www.livemint.com/Leisure/Id8PjapDYFoJqUkyzJvG7N/Drama-king.html | archivedate=30 April 2013 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

India, with its rapid economic modernisation and urbanisation, has rejected [[Gandhian economics|Gandhi's economics]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Ghosh, B.

Reporter Jim Yardley notes that, "modern India is hardly a Gandhian nation, if it ever was one. His vision of a village-dominated economy was shunted aside during his lifetime as rural romanticism, and his call for a national ethos of personal austerity and nonviolence has proved antithetical to the goals of an aspiring economic and military power."

'''Marovo''' is an [[Austronesian language]] of the [[Solomon Islands]]. It is spoken in the [[New Georgia Group]] on islands in [[Marovo Lagoon]] and on the neighbouring islands of [[New Georgia]], [[Vangunu]] and [[Nggatokae]]. The usual [[word order]] in sentences is [[verb]]-[[subject (grammar)|subject]]-[[object (grammar)|object]].

Names for local [[fauna]] are similar to but still much distinct from those in [[Roviana (language)|Roviana]] (and presumably other [[New Georgia languages]]).&lt;ref&gt;Read &amp; Moseby (2006)&lt;/ref&gt;

In a coffee room he visited regularly, he looked up at the glass window-sign from the inside and saw ''moor eeffoc''. He attributed profound significance to this trivial realization,  and he related it to our ability to gain new perspective on familiar things that have become trite because of time or use.  Chesterton commented that Dickens' writing shows this "elvish kind of realism...everywhere".&lt;ref name="AmChest" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1932">'''{{Lang|de|Musikdrama}}''' is a German word that means a unity of [[prose]] and [[music]]. Initially coined by [[Theodor Mundt]] in 1833, it was most notably used by [[Richard Wagner]], along with [[Gesamtkunstwerk]], to define his [[opera]]s.

== Usage ==
[[File:ThMundt.JPG|thumb|Theodor Mundt (1808–1861), who coined ''{{Lang|de|Musikdrama}}'' was a German critic and [[novelist]]. He was a member of the [[Young Germany]] group of German writers.]]

Mundt formulated his definition explicitly in contrast to [[intermezzo]], or a piece that sits in between dramatic entities. To this day, {{Lang|de|Musikdrama}} is associated with the works of Richard Wagner where poetry, music and stage performances were not to arbitrarily combined. Wagner himself composed the music and [[libretto]] and was a consultant on the [[stage design]] and [[choreography]]. This all-encompassing art, or {{Lang|de|[[Gesamtkunstwerk]]}}, called on the [[diegesis]] of {{Lang|de|Musikdrama}} in order to further the immersive feel.

Wagner himself resisted calling his works {{Lang|de|Musikdrama}}, which would imply a drama "meant for music," like a libretto. Instead he wanted to put music at the service of the drama, which indeed in its original ancient Greek form was inseparable from music. Nevertheless, the term music drama has become accepted. A major characteristic of Musikdrama is its formal unity, without interruptions or smaller closed forms such as arias or duets. Recurring [[leitmotif]]s provide support and interpretation of the text, which progresses as in a spoken drama.

The '''North American Computational Linguistics Olympiad''' ('''NACLO''') is a [[computational linguistics]] competition for high school students in the [[United States]] and [[Canada]] that has been held since 2007. Over 1500 students participate annually.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nacloweb.org/NACLOPRESSRELEASE-2017Invitational.pdf |title=NACLO 2017 Press Release |accessdate=12 November 2017 |date=May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 2008 the contest has consisted of two rounds, the second being administered to the top scorers in the first round. The top-scoring students on the second round qualify for the [[International Linguistics Olympiad]] (IOL), one of the [[international science olympiad]]s.

==History==

Since the mid-1960s, problem-solving competitions in linguistics for secondary school students have been taking place at various locations around the world. In Russia, the Moscow and St Petersburg Linguistic Olympiads are credited with inspiring hundreds of young talented scholars to choose linguistics as an academic major and profession. Presently there are national contests in Europe, Asia, South America, Australia and Africa, as well as North America. NACLO is part of a consortium that shares resources with other English-speaking contests such as the [[United Kingdom Linguistics Olympiad]], OzCLO (Australia) and the All-Ireland Linguistics Olympiad. There is also an International Linguistic Olympiad in which students from many countries compete, as well as dozens of local competitions held in individual towns and schools across Europe and the USA.

In 1998 the first US Linguistics Olympiad was held at the [[University of Oregon]] in [[Eugene, Oregon]], in 1998. 18 students participated the first year, 88 participated the second year, and 67 participated the third year of this local pilot program. From 2001 to 2006, the program existed as an informal, web-based educational activity known as the [http://webscript.princeton.edu/~ahesterb/puzzles.php Linguistics Challenge].

The two US teams in each year won several awards at the IOL in 2007 and 2008. Each year, one of the two US teams won a gold medal (or first diploma) in the team contest. In addition, several team members won individual medals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ilolympiad.spb.ru/results.html |title=The Fifth International Linguistics Olympiad: Results |accessdate=18 November 2008 |date=August 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://iol6.linguistics-bg.com/results.php |title=6th International Olympiad in Linguistics |accessdate=18 November 2008 |date=August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Format==

The format of the contest changed significantly between 2007 and 2008. The 2007 contest consisted of eight problems given in a single round open to all participants. The 2008 competition consisted of two rounds. The first round was open to all contestants and consisted of a three-hour, five-problem written examination. The top scorers on the open round advanced to the invitational round, which was a five-hour, seven-problem written examination divided into two parts; the first part lasted 3 and a half hours and contained five problems, while the second part lasted one and a half hour and contained two problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~eugene/Naclo/rules.html |title=NACLO Rules (2008) |accessdate=18 November 2008 |publisher=Carnegie Mellon University}}&lt;/ref&gt; The top eight scorers from the invitational round were selected to participate in the [[International Linguistics Olympiad|IOL]]. The booklets with problems and solutions are available on the main NACLO website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.naclo.cs.cmu.edu/practice.php |title=NACLO 2009—Practice Problems |accessdate=18 November 2008 |publisher=Carnegie Mellon University |date=October 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080513070610/http://www.naclo.cs.cmu.edu/practice.php |archivedate=May 13, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Palatography''' is a technique used to identify which parts of the mouth are used when making different sounds. This technique is often used by [[linguist]]s doing field work on little-known [[natural languages]]. A record made through palatography is called a ''[[palatogram]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last =  | first =  | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = Palatogram | work =  | publisher = Merriam Webster | date = 2002 | url = http://www.merriam-webster.com/medical/palatogram | format = | doi = | accessdate = 6 June 2013 | archiveurl =  | archivedate = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It involves painting a coloring agent, such as a [[dye]] or a mixture of [[charcoal]] and [[olive oil]] on the [[tongue]] or the [[palate|roof of a person's mouth]] and having that person pronounce a specific sound. A photograph is then made of the mouth roof and tongue in order to determine how the sound was articulated.

The technique can also be performed electronically ([[electropalatography]]) using a tool called a pseudo-palate, which consists of a [[retainer (orthodontics)|retainer]]-like plate lined with electrodes that is placed on the roof of the mouth while the speaker pronounces a sound.

A '''parting line''',  in industrial casting of [[Molding (process)|molds]], is the border line in which draft angles change direction.  That is, it is the dividing line that splits the core and cavity halves of a molded part.  It is sometimes a starting point for the mold parting surface.  In [[engineering drawing]], parting line is often abbreviated as PL. [[ASME]]'s Y14.8 standard specifies a symbol for parting line.&lt;ref&gt;http://memagazine.asme.org/Articles/2010/march/Expanding_Standard.cfm&lt;/ref&gt; Engineering applications (seals, tight running molded parts) that require precision for shape control, call for removal of [[Flash (manufacturing)|flash]]es. Many [[molders]] will repair or even replace the mold tooling so that the flash is reduced to an acceptable tolerance or eliminated altogether. Secondary operations to remove parting line flash include hand trimming, vibratory tumbling, media blasting and cryogenic deflashing.&lt;ref name="Nitrofreeze"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nitrofreeze.com/services/deflashing/|title=Cryogenic Deflashing for Molded Plastic, Rubber &amp; Silicone|publisher=Nitrofreeze Cryogenic Solutions|accessdate=2014-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Pietari Päivärinta''' (18 September 1827 in [[Ylivieska]] &amp;ndash; 26 July 1913) was a Finnish writer and [[Diet of Finland|Diet]] member. His depictions of peasant life, quickly translated and published in Germany and Scandinavia, are among the first examples of modern Finnish literature.

He was born in [[Ylivieska]], the eldest son of day labourers. His parents' ill health often obliged him to beg for the family's food. On his marriage to Liisa Tuomikoski he bought a small farm, but was at first unable to make it pay and began a career as an itinerant singer. In 1856 he obtained a post as an assistant clerk, and slowly furthered his career in the administration before entering politics. After his first wife's death he married Anna-Liisa Koskela.

He began writing for newspapers in 1858. His autobiography, ''My Life'', dates from 1877, and was written to pass the time during forced bedrest after breaking his leg.&lt;ref&gt;Arthur Reade. ''Finland and the Finns.'' Dodd, Mead and Co, 1917. Page 152.&lt;/ref&gt; He participated in the Diets of 1882, 1885, 1888 and 1891, and the Synod in 1876, 1886 and 1893.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8544">'''Precision viticulture''' is [[precision farming]] applied to optimize [[vineyard]] performance, in particular maximizing [[grape]] yield and quality while minimizing environmental impacts and [[risk]].&lt;ref&gt;Proffitt, T., R. Bramley, D. Lamb, and E. Winter.  2006.  ''Precision Viticulture: A New Era in Vineyard Management and Wine Production''.   Winetitles, Adelaide.  {{ISBN|978-0-9756850-4-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This is accomplished by measuring local variation in factors that influence grape yield and quality (soil, topography, [[microclimate (wine)|microclimate]], vine health, etc.) and applying appropriate [[viticulture]] management practices ([[trellis design (vine)|trellis design]], pruning, fertilizer application, [[irrigation (vine)|irrigation]], timing of [[harvest (wine)|harvest]], etc.).&lt;ref&gt;Bramley R.G.V., Hamilton R.P. 2004. Understanding variability in winegrape production systems. 1. Within vineyard variation in yield over several vintages. ''Australian Journal of Grape and Wine Research'' 10: 32-45.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bramley R.G.V. 2005. Understanding variability in winegrape production systems. 2. Within vineyard variation in quality over several vintages. ''Australian Journal of Grape and Wine Research'' 11: 33-42.&lt;/ref&gt;  Precision viticulture is based on the premise that high in-field variability for factors that affect vine growth and grape ripening warrants intensive management customized according to local conditions.  Precision viticulture depends on new and emerging technologies such as [[Global positioning system|global positioning systems (GPS)]], [[meteorology|meteorologic]] and other [[sensor|environmental sensors]], satellite and airborne [[remote sensing]], and [[Geographic information system|geographic information systems (GIS)]] to assess and respond to variability.

== Background ==
Precision viticulture is unique in its emphasis on vineyard management according to local variation, and in its use of science and technology to accomplish this.  While [[Australian wine|Australian viticulturists]] are generally recognized as leaders in precision viticulture, and while viticulturists worldwide have embraced the approach, the fundamental concepts have deep roots in the traditions of [[Old World wine]]making regions. ''[[Terroir]]'', a related French concept, refers to the special geographic qualities or "sense of place" embodied in the wine produced in a particular region.&lt;ref&gt;Robinson, J. (ed).  2006.  ''[[The Oxford Companion to Wine]], Third Edition''.  Oxford University Press.  {{ISBN|0-19-860990-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Precision agriculture]] emphasizes "doing the right thing, in the right place, at the right time", and is practical for viticulture because of high local variability of conditions within vineyards, and because of responsiveness to intensive management in terms of increased grape yield and quality.  According to CSIRO, Australia&lt;ref&gt;CSIRO, 2008. ''Australia Precision Viticulture Overview'',  http://www.csiro.au/science/Precision-Viticulture.html, accessed December 15, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; "Typically grape yield varies eight to ten-fold under uniform management";  "patterns of yield variation are stable in time and driven by soil and topographic variation";  and "patterns of variation in fruit quality tend to be similar to those for yield, suggesting opportunities for zonal management and selective harvest".  Australian precision viticulture has focused on yield monitoring, whereas California precision viticulture has focused on remote sensing.&lt;ref&gt;Goode, J.  2005.  ''The Science of Wine: from Vine to Glass''.  University of California Press, Berkeley. {{ISBN|0-520-24800-7}}, {{ISBN|978-0-520-24800-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Technology for characterizing vineyard variation ==
Precision viticulture uses a broad set of enabling technologies to observe and respond to vineyard variability:

*'''[[Global positioning system|Global Positioning Systems (GPS)]]''' provide satellite-based georeferencing for mapping vineyard environmental variability.
*'''[[Weather station|Meteorologic Stations]]''' monitor climatic factors important for vine growth and grape ripening, including temperature, precipitation, humidity, and wind.
*'''[[Remote sensing|Remote Sensing]]''' from satellite and airborne platforms provides images depicting vineyard conditions, for example vine productivity from [[Normalized Difference Vegetation Index|normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI)]].
*'''[[Digital elevation model|Digital Elevation Models (DEM)]]''' provide detailed topographic information.
*'''[[Soil|High Resolution Soil Surveys]]''' provide detailed information about soil fertility and hydrologic characteristics.
*'''[[Relational database|Relational Databases]]''' organize environmental and economic information.
*'''[[Geographic information system|Geographic Information Systems (GIS)]]''' provide digital tools for map-based analysis.
*'''[[Sensor|Other Environmental Sensors]]''' monitor important biophysical factors such as solar radiation, soil moisture, and temperature regimes.

== Management practices ==
Precision viticulture draws upon a variety of management approaches, including zonal management, in which different areas of the vineyard are managed according to their unique conditions, and [[adaptive management]], in which different management practices are applied according to observed needs and improved knowledge. Trellis design, in terms of row orientation and geometry of vine support, and pruning practices can be tailored to optimize vine health, to protect grapes from frost, sunburn, and mildew damage, and to ensure even grape ripening.&lt;ref&gt;Weiss, S.B., D.C. Luth, and B. Guerra. 2003.  Potential solar radiation in a VSP trellis at 38°N latitude.  ''Practical Winery and Vineyard'' 25:16-27.&lt;/ref&gt;  Irrigation and fertilizer application schedules, pest management, and selective harvest based on timing of ripening can all be managed to minimize costs and maximize vineyard performance based on observed needs. Increasingly, precision viticulture, with its focus on management according to local variability, is coupled with [[organic farming]], with its focus on environmentally friendly practices without the use of chemical pesticides and fertilizers, and with [[sustainable agriculture]], with emphasis on long-term [[Stewardship|environmental stewardship]] and economic viability.

== Future ==
Various integrative technological approaches are gaining increasing attention for application in precision viticulture:

*'''[[Sensor|Distributed Sensor Networks]]''' use strategic deployment of sensors throughout a vineyard to monitor key factors such as water stress and temperature.
*'''[[Scientific modeling|Vineyard Models]]''' simulate microclimate, vine growth, grape ripening, and economic return on investment to evaluate management options.
*'''[[Decision support system|Decision Support Systems (DSS)]]''' bring together vineyard environmental and economic databases, vineyard models, and GIS in an interactive software-based system to solve management problems and better make decisions.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2317">In [[mathematics]], the '''Seifert conjecture''' states that every nonsingular, continuous [[vector field]] on the [[3-sphere]] has a closed orbit.  It is named after [[Herbert Seifert]].  In a 1950 paper, Seifert asked if such a vector field exists, but did not phrase non-existence as a conjecture.  He also established the conjecture for perturbations of the [[Hopf fibration]].

The conjecture was disproven in 1974 by [[Paul Schweitzer]], who exhibited a &lt;math&gt;C^1&lt;/math&gt; counterexample.  Schweitzer's construction was then modified by [[Jenny Harrison]] in 1988 to make a &lt;math&gt;C^{2+\delta}&lt;/math&gt; counterexample for some &lt;math&gt;\delta &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt;.  The existence of smoother counterexamples remained an open question until 1993 when [[Krystyna Kuperberg]] constructed a very different &lt;math&gt;C^\infty&lt;/math&gt; counterexample.  Later this construction was shown to have real analytic and piecewise linear versions.

A '''temporal expression''' in a text is a sequence of tokens (words, numbers and characters) that denote time, that is express a point in time, a duration or a frequency. 
Examples:
:A point in time: 
&lt;pre&gt;He was born on &lt;TIMEX&gt;6 May, 1980&lt;/TIMEX&gt;.&lt;/pre&gt;
:A duration:
&lt;pre&gt;The show lasted &lt;TIMEX&gt;7 minutes&lt;/TIMEX&gt;.&lt;/pre&gt;
:A frequency:
&lt;pre&gt;The pump circulates the water &lt;TIMEX&gt;every 2 hours&lt;/TIMEX&gt;.&lt;/pre&gt;

Initially, temporal expressions were considered a type of named entities and their identification was part of the [[named entity recognition]] task. Since the Automatic Content Extraction program in 2004 there has been a separate task identified and called Temporal Expression Recognition and Normalisation (TERN). Timex evaluation is now evaluated in two major temporal annotation challenges: [[TempEval]] and [[i2b2]], both of which prefer the [[TimeML]]-level TIMEX3 standard.&lt;ref&gt;See [http://timeml.org/site/publications/timeMLdocs/timeml_1.2.1.html#timex3 TIMEX3 at timeml.org]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Approaches==
Similarly to NER systems, temporal expression taggers have been created either using linguistic [[formal grammar|grammar]]-based techniques or [[statistical model]]s. Hand-crafted grammar-based systems typically obtained better results, but at the cost of months of work by experienced linguists. There are many such systems available now,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Strötgen|first=Jannik|author2=Michael Gertz |title=HeidelTime: High quality rule-based extraction and normalization of temporal expressions|journal=Proceedings of the 5th International Workshop on Semantic Evaluation|year=2010|publisher=ACL}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Llorens|first=Hector|author2=Leon Derczynski |author3=Robert Gaizauskas |author4=Estela Saquete |title=TIMEN: An Open Temporal Expression Normalisation Resource|journal=LREC|year=2012|publisher=ACL}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Filannino|first=Michele|author2=Gavin Brown |author3=Goran Nenadic |title=ManTIME: Temporal identification and normalization in the TempEval-3 challenge|journal=Proceedings of the 7th International Workshop on Semantic Evaluation|year=2013|publisher=ACL}}&lt;/ref&gt; so creating a temporal expression recognizer from scratch is generally an undesirable duplication of effort. Instead, current approaches focus on novel subclasses of timex.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Brucato|first=Matteo|author2=Leon Derczynski |author3=Hector Llorens |author4=Kalina Bontcheva |author5=Christian S. Jensen |title=Recognising and Interpreting Named Temporal Expressions|journal=Proceedings of the International Conference on Recent Advances in Natural Language Processing|year=2013|publisher=ACL}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Statistical systems typically require a large amount of manually [[annotation|annotated]] training data and are usually applied to the recognition task only (although there is work done using machine learning algorithms to resolve certain ambiguities in the interpretation step).&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, {{Harvnb|Ahn|van Rantwijk|de Rijke|2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Angeli|first=Gabor|author2=Christoper Manning |author3=Daniel Jurafsky |title=Parsing time: Learning to interpret time expressions|journal=Proceedings of NAACL|year=2012|page=446|publisher=ACL}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ter''' ([[Eastern Armenian]]) or '''Der''' ([[Western Armenian]]) (literally "Lord"), is a hereditary [[honorific]] prefixed to family names of descendants of married clergy in the [[Armenian Apostolic Church]]. The first president of the modern [[Armenia]], [[Levon Ter-Petrosyan]] is a notable example. Both male and female descendants are entitled to the honorific which can be used only before the surname and not the Christian (first) names, since use of Ter or Der before the Christian name would denote a member of the clergy and is equivalent to "Reverend" or "Father" in English usage.

'''Yapese''' is a language spoken by the people on the [[island]] of [[Yap]] ([[Federated States of Micronesia]]). It belongs to the [[Austronesian languages]], more specifically to the [[Oceanic languages|Oceanic]] branch of that family.  It has been difficult to classify it further, but Yapese may prove to be one of the [[Admiralty Islands languages]].{{r|Lynchetal2002}}

==Orthography==
[[File:Oceanic languages.svg|thumb|left|The branches of the [[Oceanic languages]]. Orange is the Admiralties languages and Yapese, yellow-orange is [[St Matthias languages|St. Matthias]], green is [[Western Oceanic languages|Western Oceanic]], violet is [[Temotu languages|Temotu]], and the rest are [[Central-Eastern Oceanic languages|Central-Eastern]]: dark red [[Southeast Solomonic languages|Southeast Solomons]], blue [[Southern Oceanic languages|Southern Oceanic]], pink [[Micronesian languages|Micronesian]], and ocher [[Central Pacific languages|Central Pacific linkage]].]]

Written Yapese uses [[Latin script]]. In Yapese spelling as practised until the 1970s, the glottal stop was not written with an explicit character. A word-final glottal stop was represented by doubling the final vowel letter. [[Glottalization]] of consonants was represented with an apostrophe. In the 1970s an orthography was created which uses double vowel letters to represent long vowels; and because of the ambiguity that would occur if the glottal stop was not written, the glottal stop was written with the letter ''q''. This new orthography using the letter ''q'' is not in universal use, but many works and maps about Yap represent place names using the orthography and contain amounts of the letter ''q'' that are likely to be puzzling to persons not familiar with the language and the new orthography.

==Phonology==

Apart from a couple grammatical forms which are V, syllables are CV or CVC.

===Consonants===

Yapese is one of the relatively few languages in the world with [[ejective consonant|ejective]] [[fricative]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{SOWL|178}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Yapese ejective consonants are {{IPA|/pʼ tʼ kʼ θʼ/}}. There are also glottalised nasals {{IPA|/mˀ nˀ ŋˀ/}} and approximants {{IPA|/jˀ wˀ lˀ/}}.{{r|Jensen1977|p=30, 34-35}}

In the table below, each [[phoneme]] is listed to the left of the [[grapheme]] that represents it in Yapese orthography.

===Morphology===

====Reduplication====
Yapese makes use of [[reduplication]] for several morphological functions, including deriving stative adjectives from inchoative adjectives, as in (1a–b), as well as to make [[Diminutive|diminutives]] of verbs, as in (2a-b) {{r|Jensen1977|p=112-114}}:

:{{interlinear| number = (1a)
| roow
| become.red
| 'to become red'
}}

:{{interlinear | number = (1b)
| roow~roow
| STAT~red
| 'to be red'
}}

:{{interlinear | number = (2a)
| toey
| chop
| 'to chop'
}}

:{{interlinear | number = (2b)
| si-toey~toey
| DIM-DIM~chop
| 'to chop a little'
}}

====Pronouns====
Yapese distinguishes between three [[Grammatical number|numbers]] (singular, dual, and plural) and three [[Grammatical person|persons]] (first, second, and third), as well as [[Clusivity|clusivity]] in its personal pronouns {{r|Jensen1977|p=134}}.
