      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14315">An '''adjective phrase''' (or '''adjectival phrase''') is a [[phrase]] the [[Head (linguistics)|head]] word of which is an [[adjective]], e.g. ''fond of steak'', ''very happy'', ''quite upset about it'', etc.&lt;ref&gt;Most any grammar or syntax textbook or dictionary of linguistics terminology defines the adjective phrase in a similar way, e.g. Kesner Bland (1996:499), Crystal (1996:9), Greenbaum (1996:288ff.), Haegeman and Guéron (1999:70f.), Brinton (2000:172f.), Jurafsky and Martin (2000:362).&lt;/ref&gt; The '''adjective''' can initiate the phrase (e.g. ''&lt;u&gt;fond&lt;/u&gt; of steak''), conclude the phrase (e.g. ''very &lt;u&gt;happy&lt;/u&gt;''), or appear in a medial position (e.g. ''quite &lt;u&gt;upset&lt;/u&gt; about it''). The dependents of the head adjective—i.e. the other words and phrases inside the adjective phrase—are typically adverb or prepositional phrases, but they can also be [[clause]]s (e.g. ''louder than you are''). Adjectives and adjective phrases function in two basic ways, attributively or predicatively. An attributive adjective (phrase) precedes the noun of a [[noun phrase]] (e.g. ''a &lt;u&gt;very happy&lt;/u&gt;'' man). A predicative adjective (phrase) follows a linking verb and serves to describe the preceding subject, e.g. ''The man is &lt;u&gt;very happy&lt;/u&gt;''.

==Attributive vs. predicative==
The adjective phrases are underlined in the following example sentences. The head adjective in each of these phrases is in bold, and how the adjective phrase is functioning—attributively or predicatively—is stated to the right of each example:&lt;ref&gt;See Ouhalla (1994:34, 39) and Crystal (1997:9) concerning the distinction between adjectives and adjective phrases used attributively and predicatively.&lt;/ref&gt;

::(a). Sentences can contain &lt;u&gt;tremendously '''long'''&lt;/u&gt; phrases. – &lt;small&gt;Attributive adjective phrase&lt;/small&gt;
::(b). This sentence is not &lt;u&gt;tremendously '''long'''&lt;/u&gt;. – &lt;small&gt;Predicative adjective phrase&lt;/small&gt; 
 
::(c). A player &lt;u&gt;'''faster''' than you&lt;/u&gt; was on their team gaining weight. – &lt;small&gt;Attributive adjective phrase&lt;/small&gt;
::(d). He is &lt;u&gt;'''faster''' than you&lt;/u&gt;. – &lt;small&gt;Predicative adjective phrase&lt;/small&gt;

::(e). Sam ordered a &lt;u&gt;very '''spicy'''&lt;/u&gt; but &lt;u&gt;quite '''small'''&lt;/u&gt; pizza. – &lt;small&gt;Attributive adjective phrases&lt;/small&gt;
::(f). The pizza is &lt;u&gt;very '''spicy'''&lt;/u&gt; but &lt;u&gt;quite '''small'''&lt;/u&gt;. – &lt;small&gt;Predicative adjective phrases&lt;/small&gt;

::(g). People &lt;u&gt;'''angry''' with the high prices&lt;/u&gt; were protesting. – &lt;small&gt;Attributive adjective phrase&lt;/small&gt;
::(h). The people are &lt;u&gt;'''angry''' with the high prices&lt;/u&gt;. – &lt;small&gt;Predicative adjective phrase&lt;/small&gt;

The distinguishing characteristic of an attributive adjective phrase is that it appears inside the noun phrase that it modifies.&lt;ref&gt;For an overview of the differences in the use of adjective phrases, i.e. their distribution, see Greenbaum (1996:290ff.).&lt;/ref&gt; An interesting trait of these phrases in English is that an attributive adjective alone generally precedes the noun, e.g. ''a &lt;u&gt;proud&lt;/u&gt; man'', whereas a head-initial or head-medial adjective phrase follows its noun, e.g. ''a man &lt;u&gt;proud of his children&lt;/u&gt;''.&lt;ref&gt;See Haegeman and Guéron (1999:71) and Osborne (2003) concerning the distribution of pre- and post-noun modifiers in noun phrases.&lt;/ref&gt; A predicative adjective (phrase), in contrast, appears outside of the noun phrase that it describes, usually after a linking verb, e.g. ''The man is &lt;u&gt;proud of his children&lt;/u&gt;''.

==Adjective vs. adjectival==
There is a tendency to call a phrase an ''adjectival phrase'' when that phrase is functioning like an adjective phrase, but is not actually headed by an adjective. For example, in ''Mr Clinton is a man of wealth'', the prepositional phrase ''of wealth'' modifies ''a man'' in a manner similar to how an adjective phrase would, and it can be reworded with an adjective, e.g. ''Mr Clinton is a wealthy man''. A more accurate term for such cases is ''phrasal attributive'' or ''attributive phrase''.

== Constituency tests ==
[[Constituent (linguistics)|Constituency]] tests can also be used to identify adjectives and adjective phrases. Here are the three constituency tests, according to X-bar theory, that prove the adjective phrase is both a constituent, and an AP.&lt;ref&gt;These examples are generated based on the examples in this textbook:

Sportiche, D., Koopman, H. J., &amp; Stabler, E. P. (2014). ''An introduction to syntactic analysis and theory''. Chichester: Wiley-Blackwell.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sentence = '''Sam ordered a very spicy pizza.'''

=== Coordination test ===
1) [[Coordination (linguistics)|'''Coordination tests''']] can be used to confirm if ''&lt;u&gt;very spicy&lt;/u&gt;'' is an adjective phrase.

&lt;code&gt;Test 1:&lt;/code&gt; Sam ordered a &lt;u&gt;very spicy&lt;/u&gt; (and/but) ''&lt;u&gt;quite small&lt;/u&gt; pizza.'' (Sam ordered a &lt;u&gt;AP and AP&lt;/u&gt; pizza)

This phrase passed the coordination test because it was grammatical, and the adjective phrases were not creating ambiguous meanings when a conjunction (and/but) is used.

=== Ellipsis test ===
2) [[Ellipsis (linguistics)|'''Ellipsis tests''']] can be also be used to confirm if ''&lt;u&gt;very spicy&lt;/u&gt;'' is an adjective phrase.

&lt;code&gt;Test 2:&lt;/code&gt; ''Sam ordered a &lt;u&gt;very spicy&lt;/u&gt; pizza, but the pizza Betty ordered was not &lt;s&gt;very spicy&lt;/s&gt;.''

This phrase passed the Ellipsis test, because no ambiguity is created and the adjective phrase could be elided (deleted).

=== Movement test ===
3) Movement test, specifically [[pseudocleft]]ing, can be used to confirm if ''&lt;u&gt;very spicy&lt;/u&gt;'' is an adjective phrase.

&lt;code&gt;Test 3:&lt;/code&gt; ''Sam ordered a &lt;s&gt;very spicy&lt;/s&gt; pizza that was &lt;u&gt;very spicy.&lt;/u&gt;''

Movement tests not only prove that the constituent moved is a stand-alone constituent, but also proves that this phrase ''&lt;u&gt;very spicy&lt;/u&gt;'' is an AP if drawn in a syntax tree. Thus, because this adjective phrase could be moved to the right ([[pseudocleft]]), it's sufficient proof that it is both a [[Constituent (linguistics)|constituent]] and an adjective phrase.

== Semantic ambiguity ==
Although constituency tests can prove the existence of an AP in a sentence, the meanings of these AP may be [[Ambiguity|ambiguous]]. This ambiguity must be considered when considering the [[Semantic ambiguity|semantic]] versus [[Pragmatics|pragmatic]] meaning. The following examples prove two things:&lt;ref&gt;[[Guglielmo Cinque|Cinque, Guglielmo]]. (2014). The semantic classification of adjectives. A view from syntax. Studies in Chinese Linguistics. 35. 1-30.&lt;/ref&gt; 
# Adjective phrases that are pre-nominal create ambiguous interpretations.
# Head adjectives that move to post-nominal position creates unambiguous interpretations.

''Note: This section can be added into the [[adjective]]s page, but ambiguity can also apply to adjective phrases. Additionally, comma placements and intonations may have a role in figuring out ambiguity, but English has a written form of communication that is more ambiguous than spoken communication.''

The following examples show the different interpretive properties of pre- and post-nominal '''adjectives''' which are inside &lt;u&gt;adjective phrases&lt;/u&gt;.

=== Intersective versus non-intersective interpretation of AP ===

1) Intersective versus non-intersective

a. Ambiguous sentence: I’ve never met a &lt;u&gt;more '''beautiful'''&lt;/u&gt; dancer than Mary   
* Interpretation 1: I’ve never met a dancer who is more beautiful (as a person) than Mary (intersective)  
* Interpretation 2: I’ve never met anyone dancing more beautifully than Mary (nonintersective) 
b. Unambiguous sentence: I’ve never met a dancer &lt;u&gt;more '''beautiful'''&lt;/u&gt; than Mary  
* Interpretation 1: I’ve never met a dancer who is more beautiful (as a person) than Mary (intersective)  
* *Interpretation 2: I’ve never met anyone dancing more beautifully than Mary (*nonintersective) 
This example showed then entire adjective phrase moving, creating the same ambiguity as example 1. Therefore, the placement of the adjective relative to the subject is important for creating unambiguous statements.&lt;ref&gt;Larson, Richard K. 1995. Olga is a beautiful dancer. Ms., SUNY Stony Brook (text of a paper delivered at the 1995 Winter Meeting of the LSA, New Orleans (http:// semlab5.sbs.sunysb.edu/~rlarson/lsa95.pdf).&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Restrictive versus non-restrictive interpretation of AP ===

a. Ambiguous sentence: All the &lt;u&gt;short '''blessed'''&lt;/u&gt; people were healed. 
* Interpretation 1: All the short people were healed (non-restrictive) 
* Interpretation 2: Only the people that were short and blessed were healed (restrictive) 
b. Unambiguous sentence: All the &lt;u&gt;short&lt;/u&gt; people '''&lt;u&gt;blessed&lt;/u&gt;''' were healed.
* &lt;nowiki&gt;*&lt;/nowiki&gt;Interpretation 1: All the people were healed (* = not possible for this interpretation)
* Interpretation 2: All the people that were short and blessed were healed (restrictive)
The adjective '''blessed''' is ambiguous in pre-nominal position because it creates a restrictive and a nonrestrictive interpretation (1a), while in post-nominal position it only displays a restrictive interpretation (1b).&lt;ref&gt;Bolinger, Dwight. 1967. Adjectives in English: Attribution and predication. Lingua18: 1–34.&lt;/ref&gt; Plus, when the main adjective of the adjective phrase is moved to post-nominal position, only one interpretation is possible.

There is cross-linguistic validity, according to the multiple articles referenced in Cinque's article, which studied this adjective placement in Italian as well. Cinque discovered that exactly the same pattern was seen in Italian, because ambiguous interpretations only appeared when the adjective phrase was placed in pre-nominal position. Next, other research articles also confirm that this word order phenomenon exists in Mandarin Chinese, creating ambiguous interpretations. For example, an adjective phrase with the head adjective ''private'' in pre-object position, creates two interpretations. On the other hand, an adjective phrase with the head adjective ''private'' placed in post-object position only creates one interpretation.&lt;ref&gt;Paul, Waltraud. 2010. Adjectives in Mandarin Chinese: the rehabilitation of a much ostracized category. In Adjectives. Formal analyses in syntax and semantics. ed. Cabredo-Hofherr, P., and O. Matushansky, 115-152. Amsterdam: Benjamins&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tree diagram representations==
The structure of adjective phrases (and of all other phrase types) can be represented using tree structures. There are two modern conventions for doing this, constituency-based trees of [[phrase structure grammar]]s&lt;ref&gt;For examples of phrase structure trees similar to the ones produced here, see for instance Brinton (2000), Radford (2004), Culicover and Jackendoff (2005), and Carnie (2013).&lt;/ref&gt; and dependency-based trees of [[dependency grammar]]s.&lt;ref&gt;For examples of dependency trees similar to the ones produced here, see for example Tesnière (1959), Starosta (1988), and Eroms (2000).&lt;/ref&gt; Both types of trees are produced here. The important aspect of these tree structures—regardless of whether one uses constituency or dependency to show the structure of phrases—is that they are identified as adjective phrases by the label on the top node of each tree.

=== Head-final adjective phrases ===
The following trees illustrate head-final adjective phrases, i.e. adjective phrases that have their head adjective on the right side of the phrase:

::[[File:Head-final adjective phrases.png|Head-final adjective phrases]]

The labels on the nodes in the trees are acronyms: A = adjective, Adv = adverb, AP = adjective phrase, N = noun/pronoun, P = preposition, PP = prepositional phrase. The constituency trees identify these phrases as adjective phrases by labeling the top node with AP, and the dependency trees accomplish the same thing by positioning the A node at the top of the tree.

=== Head-initial adjective phrases ===
The following trees illustrate the structure of head-initial adjective phrases, i.e. adjective phrases that have their head on the left side of the phrase:

::[[File:Head-initial adjective phrases.png|Head-initial adjective phrases]]

=== Head-medial adjective phrases ===
The following trees illustrate the structure of head-medial adjective phrases:

The first African slaves arrived via [[Captaincy General of Santo Domingo|Santo Domingo]] to the [[San Miguel de Gualdape]] colony (most likely located in the [[Winyah Bay]] area of present-day [[South Carolina]]), founded by Spanish explorer [[Lucas Vázquez de Ayllón]] in 1526.&lt;ref name=wright&gt;{{cite journal|last=Robert Wright|first=Richard|authorlink=Richard Robert Wright|year=1941|title=Negro Companions of the Spanish Explorers|journal=Phylon|volume=2|issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The marriage between Luisa de Abrego, a free black domestic servant from [[Seville]] and Miguel Rodríguez, a white [[Segovia]]n conquistador in 1565 in [[St. Augustine, Florida|St. Augustine]] (Spanish Florida), is the first known and recorded Christian marriage anywhere in what is now the continental United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite|url=https://laflorida.org/florida-stories/|title=Luisa de Abrego: Marriage, Bigamy, and the Spanish Inquisition|publisher=University of Southern Florida|author=J.

The ill-fated colony was almost immediately disrupted by a fight over leadership, during which the slaves revolted and fled the colony to seek refuge among local [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]]. De Ayllón and many of the colonists died shortly afterwards of an epidemic and the colony was abandoned. The settlers and the slaves who had not escaped returned to [[Haiti]], whence they had come.&lt;ref name=wright/&gt;

An indentured servant (who could be white or black) would work for several years (usually four to seven) without wages. The status of indentured servants in early Virginia and Maryland was similar to slavery. Servants could be bought, sold, or leased and they could be physically beaten for disobedience or running away. Unlike slaves, they were freed after their term of service expired or was bought out, their children did not inherit their status, and on their release from contract they received "a year's provision of corn, double apparel, tools necessary", and a small cash payment called "freedom dues".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Tim |last=Hashaw |title=The First Black Americans |url=https://www.usnews.com/usnews/news/articles/070121/29african.htm |publisher=[[U.S. News &amp; World Report]] |date=January 21, 2007 |accessdate=February 13, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110202205901/https://www.usnews.com/usnews/news/articles/070121/29african.htm |archivedate=February 2, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the 1640s and 1650s, several African families owned farms around Jamestown and some became wealthy by colonial standards and purchased indentured servants of their own. In 1640, the Virginia General Court recorded the earliest documentation of lifetime slavery when they sentenced [[John Punch (slave)|John Punch]], a Negro, to lifetime servitude under his master Hugh Gwyn for running away.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=White Over Black: American attitudes Toward the Negro, 1550–1812|first=Winthrop|last=Jordan|publisher=University of North Carolina Press|year=1968|isbn=978-0807871416}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=In the Matter of Color: Race and the American Legal Process: The Colonial Period|first=A.

In the [[Spanish Florida]] some Spanish married or had unions with Pensacola, Creek or [[List of ethnic groups of Africa|African]] women, both slave and free, and their descendants created a mixed-race population of [[mestizo]]s and [[mulatto]]s. The Spanish encouraged slaves from the southern British colonies to come to Florida as a refuge, promising freedom in exchange for conversion to [[Catholicism]]. King [[Charles II of Spain]] issued a royal proclamation freeing all slaves who fled to Spanish Florida and accepted conversion and baptism. Most went to the area around [[St. Augustine, Florida|St. Augustine]], but escaped slaves also reached Pensacola. St. Augustine had mustered an all-black militia unit defending Spain as early as 1683.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite|url=https://www.nps.gov/articles/sanctuary-in-the-spanish-empire.htm|title=Sanctuary in the Spanish Empire: An African American officer earns freedom in Florida|author=Gene Allen Smith, Texas Christian University|publisher=National Park Service}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The popular conception of a race-based slave system did not fully develop until the 18th century. The [[Dutch West India Company]] introduced slavery in 1625 with the importation of eleven black slaves into [[New Amsterdam]] (present-day New York City). All the colony's slaves, however, were freed upon its surrender to the British.&lt;ref name="branchandroot"&gt;{{Citation|last=Hodges|first=Russel Graham|title=Root and Branch: African Americans in New York and East Jersey, 1613–1863|place=Chapel Hill, North Carolina |publisher=University of North Carolina Press|year=1999|edition=|url=|id=|isbn=|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Massachusetts]] was the first British colony to legally recognize slavery in 1641. In 1662, Virginia passed a law that children of enslaved women (who were of African descent and thus foreigners) took the status of the mother, rather than that of the father, as under English common law. This principle was called ''[[partus sequitur ventrum]]''.&lt;ref name="Banks"&gt;[https://digitalcommons.law.umaryland.edu/fac_pubs/52/ Taunya Lovell Banks, "Dangerous Woman: Elizabeth Key's Freedom Suit – Subjecthood and Racialized Identity in Seventeenth Century Colonial Virginia"], 41 ''Akron Law Review'' 799 (2008), Digital Commons Law, University of Maryland Law School, accessed April 21, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;PBS.

In the [[Spanish Louisiana]] although there was no movement toward abolition of the African slave trade, Spanish rule introduced a new law called ''coartación'', which allowed slaves to buy their freedom, and that of others.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.academia.edu/693820/Early_Anti-Slavery_Sentiment_in_the_Spanish_Atlantic_World_1765_1817]{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} Berquist, Emily. ''Early Anti-Slavery Sentiment in the Spanish Atlantic World, 1765–1817''&lt;/ref&gt; Although some did not have the money to buy their freedom that government measures on slavery allowed a high number of free blacks.

In the [[Spanish Louisiana]], Governor [[Bernardo de Gálvez]] organized Spanish free blackmen into two militia companies to defend [[New Orleans]] during the American Revolution. They fought in the 1779 battle in which Spain took [[Baton Rouge]] from the British. Gálvez also commanded them in campaigns against the British outposts in [[Mobile, Alabama|Mobile]], Alabama, and [[Pensacola]], Florida, he recruited slaves for the militia by pledging to free anyone who was seriously wounded and promised to secure a low price for ''coartación'' (buy their freedom and that of others) for those who received lesser wounds. During the 1790s, Governor [[Francisco Luis Héctor de Carondelet|Francisco Luis Héctor, baron of Carondelet]] reinforced local fortifications and recruit even more free blackmen for the militia. Carondelet doubled the number of free blackmen who served, creating two more militia companies—one made up of black members and the other of [[pardo]] (mixed race). Serving in the militia brought free blackmen one step closer to equality with whites, allowing them, for example, the right to carry arms and boosting their earning power. However actually these privileges distanced free blackmen from enslaved blacks and encouraged them to identify with whites.&lt;ref name="louisiana"/&gt;

Slavery had been tacitly enshrined in the [[U.S. Constitution]] through provisions such as Article I, Section 2, Clause 3, commonly known as the  [[3/5 compromise]]. Slavery, which by then meant almost exclusively African Americans, was the most important political issue in the [[antebellum United States]], leading to one crisis after another. Among these were the [[Missouri Compromise]], the [[Compromise of 1850]], the [[Fugitive Slave Act]], and the [[Dred Scott decision]].

The slaves not only constituted a large investment, they produced America's most valuable product and export: [[King Cotton|cotton]]. They not only helped build the [[U.S. Capitol]], they built the [[White House]] and other [[District of Columbia]] buildings.

African Americans quickly set up congregations for themselves, as well as schools and community/civic associations, to have space away from white control or oversight. While the post-war Reconstruction era was initially a time of progress for African Americans, that period ended in 1876.

In the last decade of the 19th century, racially discriminatory laws and racial violence aimed at African Americans began to mushroom in the United States, a period often referred to as the "[[nadir of American race relations]]".  These discriminatory acts included [[racial segregation]]—upheld by the United States Supreme Court decision in ''[[Plessy v. Ferguson]]'' in 1896—which was legally mandated by southern states and nationwide at the local level of government, voter suppression or disenfranchisement in the southern states, denial of economic opportunity or resources nationwide, and private acts of violence and mass racial violence aimed at African Americans unhindered or encouraged by government authorities.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Plessy v.

Overall, blacks in Northern and Western cities experienced [[Racism in the United States|systemic discrimination]] in a plethora of aspects of life.

By the 1950s, the [[civil rights movement]] was gaining momentum. A 1955 lynching that sparked public outrage about injustice was that of [[Emmett Till]], a 14-year-old boy from Chicago.

The [[March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom]] and the conditions which brought it into being are credited with putting pressure on Presidents [[John F. Kennedy]] and [[Lyndon B. Johnson]]. Johnson put his support behind passage of the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]] that banned discrimination in public accommodations, employment, and [[Trade union|labor unions]], and the [[Voting Rights Act]] of 1965, which expanded federal authority over states to ensure black political participation through protection of voter registration and elections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.justice.gov/crt/about/vot/intro/intro_b.php|title=History of Federal Voting Rights Laws: The Voting Rights Act of 1965|publisher=United States Department of Justice|accessdate=August 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1966, the emergence of the [[Black Power]] movement, which lasted from 1966 to 1975, expanded upon the aims of the civil rights movement to include economic and political self-sufficiency, and freedom from white authority.&lt;ref name="abbeville"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.abbeville.com/civilrights/washington.asp |title=The March On Washington, 1963 |accessdate=October 22, 2007 |publisher=Abbeville Press |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071012121716/https://abbeville.com/civilrights/washington.asp |archivedate=October 12, 2007 |deadurl=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the postwar period, many African Americans continued to be economically disadvantaged relative to other Americans. Average black income stood at 54 percent of that of white workers in 1947, and 55 percent in 1962. In 1959, median family income for whites was $5,600, compared with $2,900 for nonwhite families. In 1965, 43 percent of all black families fell into the poverty bracket, earning under $3,000 a year. The Sixties saw improvements in the social and economic conditions of many black Americans.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;The Unfinished Journey: America Since World War II by William H. Chafe&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1965 to 1969, black family income rose from 54 to 60 percent of white family income. In 1968, 23 percent of black families earned under $3,000 a year, compared with 41 percent in 1960. In 1965, 19 percent of black Americans had incomes equal to the national median, a proportion that rose to 27 percent by 1967. In 1960, the median level of education for blacks had been 10.8 years, and by the late Sixties the figure rose to 12.2 years, half a year behind the median for whites.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

In 1989, [[Douglas Wilder]] became the first African American elected governor in U.S. history. [[Clarence Thomas]] became the second African-American Supreme Court Justice. In 1992, [[Carol Moseley-Braun]] of [[Illinois]] became the first African-American woman elected to the [[United States Senate|U.S. Senate]].

In 1790, when the first [[United States Census|U.S. Census]] was taken, Africans (including slaves and free people) numbered about 760,000—about 19.3% of the population. In 1860, at the start of the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], the African-American population had increased to 4.4 million, but the percentage rate dropped to 14% of the overall population of the country. The vast majority were slaves, with only 488,000 counted as "[[Freedman|freemen]]". By 1900, the black population had doubled and reached 8.8 million.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}

In 1910, about 90% of African Americans lived in the South. Large numbers began migrating north looking for better job opportunities and living conditions, and to escape [[Jim Crow laws]] and racial violence. The [[Great Migration (African American)|Great Migration]], as it was called, spanned the 1890s to the 1970s. From 1916 through the 1960s, more than 6 million [[black people]] moved north. But in the 1970s and 1980s, [[New Great Migration|that trend reversed]], with more African Americans moving south to the [[Sun Belt]] than leaving it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Magazine|first1=Editors of Time|title=Time: Almanac 2005|publisher=Time Incorporated Home Entertainment|page=377|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JvJOP6ap07sC|language=en|date=December 7, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1990, the African-American population reached about 30 million and represented 12% of the U.S. population, roughly the same proportion as in 1900.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://lcweb2.loc.gov/ammem/aap/timelin2.html|title=Time Line of African American History, 1881–1900|publisher=Lcweb2.loc.gov|date=|accessdate=April 20, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the time of the [[United States Census 2000|2000 Census]], 54.8% of African Americans lived in the [[Southern United States|South]]. In that year, 17.6% of African Americans lived in the [[Northeastern United States|Northeast]] and 18.7% in the [[Midwestern United States|Midwest]], while only 8.9% lived in the [[Western United States|western]] states. The west does have a sizable black population in certain areas, however.

According to the 2000 Census, approximately 2.05% of [[Black Hispanic and Latino Americans|African Americans identified as Hispanic or Latino in origin]],&lt;ref name="tthqvu"/&gt; many of whom may be of [[Afro-Brazilian|Brazilian]], [[Puerto Rican people|Puerto Rican]], [[Dominican American|Dominican]], [[Afro-Cuban|Cuban]], [[Haitian Americans|Haitian]], or other [[Afro-Latin American|Latin American]] descent.

According to the [[2010 United States Census|2010 US Census]], nearly 3% of people who self-identified as black had recent ancestors who immigrated from another country.

Mixed-Race Hispanic and non-Hispanic Americans who identified as being part black, represented 0.9% of the population. Of the 12.6% of United States residents who identified as black, around 10.3% were "native black American" or ethnic African Americans, who are direct descendants of West/Central Africans brought to the U.S. as slaves. These individuals make up well over 80% of all blacks in the country.

Instead, they wrote in their own respective ethnic groups in the "Some Other Race" write-in entry. As a result, the census bureau devised a new, separate "African American" ethnic group category in 2010 for ethnic African Americans.&lt;ref name="Tcpms"&gt;{{cite web|title=2010 CENSUS PLANNING MEMORANDA SERIES|url=https://www.census.gov/2010census/pdf/2010_Census_Race_HO_AQE.pdf|publisher=United States Census Bureau|accessdate=November 3, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As with the earlier Great Migration, the New Great Migration is primarily directed toward cities and large urban areas, such as [[Atlanta]], [[Charlotte, North Carolina|Charlotte]], [[Houston]], [[Dallas]], [[Raleigh, North Carolina|Raleigh]], [[Tampa]], [[San Antonio]], [[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]], [[Nashville]], [[Jacksonville]], and so forth.&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;Greg Toppo and Paul Overberg, [https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2015/02/02/census-great-migration-reversal/21818127/ "After nearly 100 years, Great Migration begins reversal"], ''USA Today'', 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; A growing percentage of African-Americans from the west and north are migrating to the southern region of the U.S. for economic and cultural reasons.  New York City, Chicago, and Los Angeles have the highest decline in African Americans, while Atlanta, [[Dallas, Texas|Dallas]], and [[Houston, Texas|Houston]] have the highest increase respectively.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;

Among cities of 100,000 or more, [[Detroit|Detroit, Michigan]] had the highest percentage of black residents of any U.S. city in 2010, with 82%. Other large cities with African-American majorities include [[Jackson, Mississippi]] (79.4%), [[Miami Gardens, Florida]] (76.3%), [[Baltimore|Baltimore, Maryland]] (63%), [[Birmingham, Alabama]] (62.5%), [[Memphis, Tennessee]] (61%), [[New Orleans|New Orleans, Louisiana]] (60%),  [[Montgomery, Alabama]] (56.6%), [[Flint, Michigan]] (56.6%), [[Savannah, Georgia]] (55.0%), [[Augusta, Georgia]] (54.7%), [[Atlanta|Atlanta, Georgia]] (54%, see [[African Americans in Atlanta]]), [[Cleveland, Ohio]] (53.3%), [[Newark, New Jersey]] (52.35%), [[Washington, D.C.]] (50.7%), [[Richmond, Virginia]] (50.6%), [[Mobile, Alabama]] (50.6%), [[Baton Rouge, Louisiana]] (50.4%), and [[Shreveport, Louisiana]] (50.4%).

The nation's most affluent community with an African-American majority resides in [[View Park–Windsor Hills, California]] with an annual median income of $159,618.&lt;ref&gt;[https://atlantablackstar.com/2014/01/03/10-richest-black-communities-america/5/ "10 of the Richest Black Communities in America"], ''Atlanta Black Star'', January 3, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; Other largely affluent predominantly African-American communities include [[Prince George's County, Maryland|Prince George's County]] in Maryland (namely [[Mitchellville, Maryland|Mitchellville]], [[Woodmore, Maryland|Woodmore]], and [[Upper Marlboro, Maryland|Upper Marlboro]]), [[DeKalb County, Georgia|Dekalb County]] in Georgia, [[Charles City County, Virginia|Charles City County]] in Virginia, [[Baldwin Hills, Los Angeles|Baldwin Hills]] in California, [[Hillcrest, Rockland County, New York|Hillcrest]] and [[Uniondale, New York|Uniondale]] in New York, and [[Cedar Hill, Texas|Cedar Hill]], [[DeSoto, Texas|DeSoto]], and [[Missouri City, Texas|Missouri City]] in Texas. [[Queens|Queens County, New York]] is the only county with a population of 65,000 or more where African Americans have a higher median household income than White Americans.&lt;ref name=Queens/&gt;

As late as 1947, about one third of African Americans over 65 were considered to lack the literacy to read and write their own names. By 1969, [[illiteracy]] as it had been traditionally defined, had been largely eradicated among younger African Americans.&lt;ref&gt;Public Information Office, [[U.S. Census Bureau]].

US Census surveys showed that by 1998, 89 percent of African Americans aged 25 to 29 had completed a high-school education, less than whites or Asians, but more than Hispanics. On many college entrance, standardized tests and grades, African Americans have historically lagged behind whites, but some studies suggest that the [[Achievement gap in the United States|achievement gap]] has been closing.

In the New York City school district 28% of black males graduate high school compared to 57% of white males. In Newark County{{Where|date=September 2014}} 76% of black males graduated compared to 67% for white males. Further academic improvement has occurred in 2015.

Economically, African Americans have benefited from the advances made during the [[civil rights era]], particularly among the educated, but not without the lingering effects of historical marginalisation when considered as a whole.

Nationwide, the October 2008 unemployment rate for African Americans was 11.1%,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bls.gov/news.release/empsit.t02.htm|title=BLS.gov|publisher=BLS.gov|date=January 7, 2011|accessdate=January 20, 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101213004820/https://bls.gov/news.release/empsit.t02.htm|archivedate=December 13, 2010 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; while the nationwide rate was 6.5%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://data.bls.gov/PDQ/servlet/SurveyOutputServlet?data_tool=latest_numbers&amp;series_id=LNS14000000|title=BLS.gov|publisher=Data.bls.gov|accessdate=January 20, 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110120154929/https://data.bls.gov/PDQ/servlet/SurveyOutputServlet?data_tool=latest_numbers&amp;series_id=LNS14000000|archivedate=January 20, 2011 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The income gap between black and white families is also significant. In 2005, employed blacks earned 65% of the wages of whites, down from 82% in 1975.&lt;ref name="DeNavas-Walt"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Carmen DeNavas-Walt |author2=Bernadette D.

===Politics===
A large majority of African Americans support the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]]. In the [[United States presidential election, 2004|2004 Presidential Election]], Democrat [[John Kerry]] received 88% of the African-American vote compared to 11% for [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] [[George W. Bush]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.cnn.com/ELECTION/2004/pages/results/states/US/P/00/epolls.0.html|title=2004 Election Results|publisher=CNN|year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although there is an [[African-American lobby in foreign policy]], it has not had the impact that African-American organizations have had in domestic policy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=American Society and the African American Foreign Policy Lobby: Constraints and Opportunities|first=David A.|last=Dickson|journal=Journal of Black Studies|year=1996|pages=139–151|volume=27|doi=10.1177/002193479602700201|issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many African Americans were excluded from electoral politics in the decades following the end of Reconstruction. For those that could participate, until the [[New Deal]], African Americans were supporters of the Republican Party because it was Republican President Abraham Lincoln who helped in granting freedom to American slaves; at the time, the Republicans and Democrats represented the [[Sectionalism|sectional]] interests of the [[Northern United States|North]] and [[Southern United States|South]], respectively, rather than any specific ideology, and both [[Conservatism in the United States|conservative]] and [[Modern liberalism in the United States|liberal]] were represented equally in both parties.

The African-American trend of voting for Democrats can be traced back to the 1930s during the [[Great Depression]], when [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]]'s [[New Deal]] program provided economic relief to African Americans. Roosevelt's [[New Deal coalition]] turned the Democratic Party into an organization of the working class and their liberal allies, regardless of region. The African-American vote became even more solidly Democratic when Democratic presidents [[John F. Kennedy]] and [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] pushed for civil rights legislation during the 1960s. In 1960, nearly a third of African Americans voted for Republican [[Richard Nixon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=John Clifford Green|author2=Daniel J.

According to a genome-wide study by Bryc et al. (2009), the overall ancestry of African Americans was formed through historic admixture between West/Central Africans (more frequently females) and Europeans (more frequently males). Consequently, the 365 African Americans in their sample have a genome-wide average of 78.1% West African ancestry and 18.5% European ancestry, with large variation among individuals (ranging from 99% to 1% West African ancestry). The West African ancestral component in African Americans is most similar to that in present-day speakers from the non-[[Bantu languages|Bantu]] branches of the [[Niger-Congo languages|Niger-Congo]] (Niger-Kordofanian) family.&lt;ref name="Bryc2009"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Katarzyna Bryc |author2=Adam Auton |author3=Matthew R.

Correspondingly, Montinaro et al. (2014) observed that around 50% of the overall ancestry of African Americans traces back to the Niger-Congo-speaking [[Yoruba people|Yoruba]] of southwestern [[Nigeria]] and southern [[Benin]], reflecting the centrality of this West African region in the Atlantic Slave Trade. The next most frequent ancestral component found among African Americans was derived from [[Great Britain]], in keeping with historical records.

Altogether, genetic studies suggest that African Americans are a multiracial people. According to DNA analysis led in 2006 by [[Pennsylvania State University|Penn State]] geneticist [[Mark D. Shriver]], around 58 percent of African Americans have at least 12.5% European ancestry (equivalent to one European great-grandparent and his/her forebears), 19.6 percent of African Americans have at least 25% European ancestry (equivalent to one European grandparent and his/her forebears), and 1 percent of African Americans have at least 50% European ancestry (equivalent to one European parent and his/her forebears).&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Henry Louis Gates Jr.: Michelle's Great-Great-Great-Granddaddy—and Yours|url=https://historynewsnetwork.org/article/118292|author=Henry Louis Gates Jr.|date=November 8, 2009|accessdate=April 11, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Shriver, around 5 percent of African Americans also have at least 12.5% Native American ancestry (equivalent to one Native American great-grandparent and his/her forebears).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Henry Louis Gates, Jr. Reader|author=Henry Louis Gates, Jr.|publisher=Basci Civitas Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=5 Things to Know About Blacks and Native Americans|url=https://www.ebony.com/life/5-things-to-know-about-blacks-and-native-americans-119#axzz3WyEqX3XZ|date=November 20, 2012|accessdate=April 11, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Y-DNA===
According to a [[Y chromosome|Y-DNA]] study by Sims et al. (2007), the majority (~60%) of African Americans belong to various subclades of the [[Haplogroup E-V38|E3a]] (E1b1a) paternal haplogroup. This is the most common genetic paternal lineage found today among West/Central African males, and is also a signature of the historical [[Bantu migration]]s. The next most frequent Y-DNA haplogroup observed among African Americans is the [[Haplogroup R1b (Y-DNA)|R1b]] clade, which around 15% of African Americans carry. This lineage is most common today among Northwestern European males. The remaining African Americans mainly belong to the paternal [[Haplogroup I-M170|haplogroup I]] (~7%), which is also frequent in Northwestern Europe.&lt;ref name="Sims2007"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Lynn M.

===mtDNA===
According to an [[Mitochondrial DNA|mtDNA]] study by Salas et al. (2005), the maternal lineages of African Americans are most similar to haplogroups that are today especially common in West Africa (&gt;55%), followed closely by West-Central Africa and Southwestern Africa (&lt;41%). The characteristic West African haplogroups [[Haplogroup L1 (mtDNA)|L1b]], [[Haplogroup L2 (mtDNA)|L2b,c,d]], and [[Haplogroup L3 (mtDNA)|L3b,d]] and West-Central African haplogroups [[Haplogroup L1 (mtDNA)|L1c]] and [[Haplogroup L3 (mtDNA)|L3e]] in particular occur at high frequencies among African Americans.

African Americans have improved their social and economic standing significantly since the civil rights movement and recent decades have witnessed the expansion of a robust, African-American middle class across the United States. Unprecedented access to higher education and employment in addition to representation in the highest levels of American government has been gained by African Americans in the post–civil rights era.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Thernstrom|first1=Abigail|author1-link=Abigail Thernstrom|last2=Thernstrom|first2=Stephan|author2-link=Stephan Thernstrom|title=Black Progress: How far we've come, and how far we have to go|url=https://www.brookings.edu/articles/black-progress-how-far-weve-come-and-how-far-we-have-to-go/|accessdate=March 17, 2018|date= March 1, 1998|publisher=Brookings Institution}}&lt;/ref&gt;

African Americans have a long and diverse history of [[African-American Businesses|business ownership]]. Although the first [[African-American Businesses|African-American business]] is unknown, slaves captured from West Africa are believed to have established commercial enterprises as peddlers and skilled craftspeople as far back as the 17th century. Around 1900, Booker T. Washington became the most famous proponent of African American businesses. His critic and rival W.E.B.

The gains made by African Americans in the [[civil rights movement]] and in the [[Black Power movement]] not only obtained certain rights for African Americans, but changed American society in far-reaching and fundamentally important ways. Prior to the 1950s, Black Americans in the South were subject to de jure discrimination, or [[Jim Crow laws]]. They were often the victims of extreme cruelty and violence, sometimes resulting in deaths: by the post World War II era, African Americans became increasingly discontented with their long-standing inequality. In the words of [[Martin Luther King, Jr.]], African Americans and their supporters challenged the nation to "rise up and live out the true meaning of its creed that all men are created equal ..."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://usinfo.state.gov/usa/infousa/facts/democrac/38.htm|title=Martin Luther King, Jr|accessdate=May 30, 2007|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070613010952/https://usinfo.state.gov/usa/infousa/facts/democrac/38.htm|archivedate=June 13, 2007|deadurl=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The civil rights movement marked an enormous change in American social, political, economic and civic life. It brought with it [[boycott]]s, [[sit-in]]s, [[nonviolent]] demonstrations and marches, court battles, bombings and other violence; prompted worldwide media coverage and intense public debate; forged enduring civic, economic and religious alliances; and disrupted and realigned the nation's two major political parties.

Over time, it has changed in fundamental ways the manner in which blacks and whites interact with and relate to one another. The movement resulted in the removal of codified, ''de jure'' racial segregation and discrimination from American life and law, and heavily influenced other groups and movements in struggles for civil rights and social equality within American society, including the [[Free Speech Movement]], the [[Disability|disabled]], the [[Feminist movement|women's movement]], [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]], and [[migrant workers]].

Most programming on the network consists of [[Hip hop music|rap]] and [[Contemporary R&amp;B|R&amp;B]] music videos and urban-oriented movies and series. The channel also shows syndicated television series, original programs, and some public affairs programs. On Sunday mornings, BET broadcasts a lineup of network-produced Christian programming; other, non-affiliated Christian programs are also shown during the early morning hours daily.

In addition to BET there is [[BET Her]], which is a spin-off cable television channel of BET, created originally as ''BET on Jazz'' to showcase [[jazz]] music-related programming, especially that of black jazz musicians.

[[TV One (Radio One)|TV One]] is another African-American-oriented network and a direct competitor to BET, targeting African-American adults with a broad range of programming.

[[File:Soul Food at Powell's Place.jpg|thumb|A traditional [[soul food]] dinner consisting of [[fried chicken]] with [[macaroni and cheese]], [[collard greens]], breaded fried [[okra]] and [[cornbread]].]]
From their earliest presence in [[North America]], African Americans have significantly contributed literature, art, agricultural skills, cuisine, clothing styles, music, language, and social and technological innovation to American culture. The cultivation and use of many agricultural products in the United States, such as [[Sweet potato|yams]], [[peanut]]s, [[rice]], [[okra]], [[sorghum]], [[grits]], [[watermelon]], [[indigo dye]]s, and [[cotton]], can be traced to West African and African-American influences. Notable examples include [[George Washington Carver]], who created 300 products from peanuts, 118 products from sweet potatoes, and 75 products from pecans; and [[George Crum]], a local legend associates him with the creation of the potato chip in 1853.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first1=Steve |last1=Berry |first2=Phil |last2=Norman |last-author-amp=yes |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/foodanddrink/10965628/Crisps-buoyed-Britain-in-its-darkest-hour.html |title='Crisps buoyed Britain in its darkest hour' |newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]] |date=July 14, 2014 |accessdate=November 14, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.enchantedlearning.com/inventors/black.shtml|title=African-American Inventors|accessdate=May 30, 2007|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070613230925/https://www.enchantedlearning.com/inventors/black.shtml|archivedate=June 13, 2007|deadurl=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Soul food]] is a variety of cuisine popular among African Americans. It is closely related to the [[cuisine of the Southern United States]]. The descriptive terminology may have originated in the mid-1960s, when ''[[wikt:soul|soul]]'' was a common definer used to describe African-American culture (for example, [[soul music]]). African Americans were the first peoples in the United States to make fried chicken, along with [[Scottish people|Scottish]] immigrants to the South. Although the Scottish had been frying chicken before they emigrated, they lacked the spices and flavor that African Americans had used when preparing the meal. The Scottish American settlers therefore adopted the African-American method of seasoning chicken.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Advances in Deep Fat Frying of Foods|author1=Servet Gulum Sumnu |author2=Serpil Sahin |pages=1–2}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, fried chicken was generally a rare meal in the African-American community, and was usually reserved for special events or celebrations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=World of a Slave: Encyclopedia of the Material Life of Slaves in the United States|author1=Martha B.

===Language===
{{Main|African-American English}}
[[African American English]] is a [[Variety (linguistics)|variety]] ([[dialect]], [[ethnolect]], and [[sociolect]]) of [[American English]], commonly spoken by urban [[working class|working-class]] and largely [[wikt:bidialectal|bi-dialectal]] [[middle class|middle-class]] African Americans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Edwards|first=Walter|chapter=African American Vernacular English: phonology|editor-last=Kortmann|editor-first=Bernd|work=A Handbook of Varieties of English|publisher=Walter de Gruyter|year=2004|volume=2|page=383|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Dptsvykgk3IC|title=A Handbook of Varieties of English: CD-ROM|isbn=9783110175325}}&lt;/ref&gt;

African-American English evolved during the antebellum period through interaction between speakers of 16th and 17th century English of Great Britain and Ireland and various West African languages. As a result, the variety shares parts of its [[grammar]] and [[phonology]] with the [[Southern American English]] dialect. Where African American English differs from Standard American English (SAE) is in certain pronunciation characteristics, tense usage and grammatical structures that were derived from West African languages, particularly those belonging to the [[Niger-Congo languages|Niger-Congo]] family.&lt;ref name="Aave"&gt;{{cite book|title=Encyclopedia of Cross-Cultural School Psychology|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=978-0387717982|page=405|url=https://www.google.com/books?id=PaO3jsaGkeYC|accessdate=October 21, 2014|date=2010-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Virtually all habitual speakers of African American English can understand and communicate in Standard American English. As with all linguistic forms, AAVE's usage is influenced by various factors, including geographical, educational and socioeconomic background, as well as formality of setting.&lt;ref name="Aave"/&gt; Additionally, there are many literary uses of this variety of English, particularly in [[African-American literature]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Green|first1=Lisa J.|title=African American English : a linguistic introduction|date=2002|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|isbn=978-0521891387|pages=164–199|edition=1. publ., 4. print.|url=https://books.google.com/?id=bcpuNbPu-LgC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to the 1950s, and 1960s, most African-American names closely resembled those used within European American culture.&lt;ref name="Norman"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Norman|first1=Teresa|title=The African-American Baby Name Book|date=1998|publisher=Berkley Books|isbn=978-0425159392|url=https://www.google.com/books?id=XPkLGtzsKv0C|accessdate=May 1, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Babies of that era were generally given a few common names, with children using [[nickname]]s to distinguish the various people with the same name. With the rise of 1960s civil rights movement, there was a dramatic increase in names of various origins.&lt;ref name="Moskowitz"&gt;{{cite news|last=Moskowitz|first=Clara|title=Baby Names Reveal More About Parents Than Ever Before|url=https://www.livescience.com/9027-baby-names-reveal-parents.html|newspaper=Live Science|date=November 30, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the 1970s, and 1980s, it had become common among African Americans to invent new names for themselves, although many of these invented names took elements from popular existing names. Prefixes such as La/Le, Da/De, Ra/Re and Ja/Je, and suffixes like -ique/iqua, -isha and -aun/-awn are common, as are inventive spellings for common names. The book ''Baby Names Now: From Classic to Cool--The Very Last Word on First Names'' places the origins of "La" names in African-American culture in [[New Orleans]].&lt;ref name="Rosenkrantz"&gt;{{cite book|last=Rosenkrantz|first=Linda|title=Baby Names Now: From Classic to Cool--The Very Last Word on First Names|date=August 16, 2001|publisher=St. Martin's Griffin|isbn=978-0312267575|url=https://www.amazon.com/Baby-Names-Now-Classic-Cool--The/dp/B0009X1MMS/|author2=Satran, Paula Redmond}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Even with the rise of inventive names, it is still common for African Americans to use biblical, historical, or traditional European names. Daniel, Christopher, Michael, David, James, Joseph, and Matthew were thus among the most frequent names for African-American boys in 2013.&lt;ref name="Norman"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Lack|first=Evonne|title=Popular African American Names|url=https://www.babycenter.com/0_popular-african-american-names_10329236.bc|accessdate=February 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Conley"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Conley|first=Dalton|title=Raising E and Yo…|journal=Psychology Today|date=March 10, 2010|url=https://www.psychologytoday.com/articles/201003/raising-e-and-yo}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The name LaKeisha is typically considered American in origin, but has elements of it that were drawn from both French and West/Central African roots. Other names like LaTanisha, JaMarcus, DeAndre, and Shaniqua were created in the same way. Punctuation marks are seen more often within African-American names than other American names, such as the names Mo'nique and D'Andre.&lt;ref name="Norman"/&gt;

[[African-American music]] is one of the most pervasive African-American cultural influences in the United States today and is among the most dominant in mainstream popular music. [[Hip hop music|Hip hop]], [[Rhythm and blues|R&amp;B]], [[funk]], [[rock and roll]], [[soul music|soul]], [[blues]], and other contemporary American musical forms originated in black communities and evolved from other black forms of music, including [[blues]], [[doo-wop]], [[Barbershop music|barbershop]], [[ragtime]], [[Bluegrass music|bluegrass]], [[jazz]], and [[gospel music]].

African-American-derived musical forms have also influenced and been incorporated into virtually every other [[popular music]] genre in the world, including [[Country music|country]] and [[techno]]. African-American genres are the most important ethnic vernacular tradition in America, as they have developed independent of African traditions from which they arise more so than any other immigrant groups, including Europeans; make up the broadest and longest lasting range of styles in America; and have, historically, been more influential, interculturally, geographically, and economically, than other American vernacular traditions.&lt;ref name="stewart"&gt;{{cite book|last=Stewart|first=Earl L.|year=1998|title=African American Music: An Introduction|isbn=978-0-02-860294-3|page=3|publisher=Schirmer Books|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;

African Americans have also had an important role in American dance. [[Bill T. Jones]], a prominent modern choreographer and dancer, has included historical African-American themes in his work, particularly in the piece "Last Supper at Uncle Tom's Cabin/The Promised Land". Likewise, [[Alvin Ailey]]'s artistic work, including his "Revelations" based on his experience growing up as an African American in the South during the 1930s, has had a significant influence on modern dance. Another form of dance, [[Stepping (African-American)|Stepping]], is an African-American tradition whose performance and competition has been formalized through the traditionally black fraternities and sororities at universities.&lt;ref name="Anderson"&gt;{{Cite news|last=Harris|first=Samantha|title=Stepping into controversy: Some fraternity members fear film 'Stomp the Yard' portrays them as glamorized dance group, trivializes traditions|newspaper=[[The Anderson Independent-Mail]]|location=[[Anderson, South Carolina]]|date=January 25, 2007|url=https://www.independentmail.com/news/2007/jan/25/stepping-controversy-some-fraternity-members-fear-/|accessdate=January 11, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110629142134/http://www.independentmail.com/news/2007/jan/25/stepping-controversy-some-fraternity-members-fear-/|archive-date=June 29, 2011|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Literature and academics===
Many African-American authors have written stories, poems, and essays influenced by their experiences as African Americans. [[African-American literature]] is a major genre in American literature.

African-American inventors have created many widely used devices in the world and have contributed to international [[innovation]].

==Terminology==
===General===
[[File:1911 Golden Potlatch - Afro-Americans.jpg|thumb|left|This parade float displayed the word "Afro-American" in 1911.]]
The term ''African American'' carries important political overtones. Earlier terms used to describe Americans of African ancestry referred more to skin color than to ancestry, and were conferred upon the group by colonists and Americans of European ancestry; people with dark skins were considered inferior in fact and in law. Other terms (such as ''[[colored]]'', ''[[person of color]]'', or ''[[negro]]'') were included in the wording of various laws and legal decisions which some thought were being used as tools of [[white supremacy]] and [[oppression]].&lt;ref name="books.google.com"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=xoZ0POyF2YkC&amp;pg=PA86|title=Out of the Mouths of Slaves: African American Language and Educational Malpractice|author=Baugh, John|page=86|publisher=[[University of Texas Press]]|isbn=978-0-292-70873-0|year=1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Published in 1782, the book's use of this phrase predates any other yet identified by more than 50 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://blogs.harvard.edu/houghton/2015/04/23/exploring-the-origins-of-african-american/|title=Exploring the origins of "African American" Houghton Library Blog|website=blogs.harvard.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1980s, the term ''African American'' was advanced on the model of, for example, [[German-American]] or [[Irish-American]] to give descendants of American slaves and other American blacks who lived through the [[Slavery in the United States|slavery era]] a [[Cultural heritage|heritage]] and a cultural base.&lt;ref name="books.google.com"/&gt; The term was popularized in black communities around the country via word of mouth and ultimately received mainstream use after [[Jesse Jackson]] publicly used the term in front of a national audience in 1988. Subsequently, major media outlets adopted its use.&lt;ref name="books.google.com"/&gt;

Surveys show that the majority of Black Americans have no preference for ''African American'' versus ''Black American'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.gallup.com/poll/28816/black-african-american.aspx|title=Black or African American?|first=Frank|last=Newport|publisher=Gallup|date=September 28, 2007|accessdate=September 26, 2010|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100906124630/https://www.gallup.com/poll/28816/Black-African-American.aspx|archivedate=September 6, 2010 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; although they have a slight preference for ''Black American'' in personal settings and ''African American'' in more formal settings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Miller|first1=Pepper|last2=Kemp|first2=Herb|title=What's Black About?

Many African Americans have expressed a preference for the term ''African American'' because it was formed in the same way as the terms for the many other ethnic groups currently living in the nation. Some argued further that, because of the historical circumstances surrounding the capture, enslavement and systematic attempts to de-Africanize blacks in the United States under [[Slavery|chattel slavery]], most African Americans are unable to trace their ancestry to a specific African nation; hence, the entire continent serves as a geographic marker.

The term ''African American'' embraces pan-Africanism as earlier enunciated by prominent African thinkers such as [[Marcus Garvey]], [[W. E. B. Du Bois]] and [[George Padmore]]. The term ''Afro-Usonian'', and variations of such, are more rarely used.&lt;ref&gt;Timothy Brennan, ''Secular Devotion: Afro-Latin Music and Imperial Jazz'', 2008, p. 249.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.economist.com/blogs/johnson/2010/12/what_call_americans "Yankees, gringos and USAnians"], ''[[The Economist]]'', December 9, 2010, retrieved March 26, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Identity===
Since 1977, in an attempt to keep up with changing social opinion, the United States government has officially classified black people (revised to ''black'' or ''African American'' in 1997) as "having origins in any of the black racial groups of Africa."&lt;ref name="censusblack"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/prod/2001pubs/c2kbr01-5.pdf|first=Jesse|last=McKinnon|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=October 22, 2007|format=PDF|title=The Black Population: 2000 United States Census Bureau}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other federal offices, such as the [[United States Census]] Bureau, adhere to the [[Office of Management and Budget]] standards on race in its data collection and tabulations efforts.&lt;ref name="OMB"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/fedreg/1997standards.html |title=Revisions to the Standards for the Classification of Federal Data on Race and Ethnicity |year=1997 |publisher=Office of Management and Budget |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090315191301/https://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/fedreg/1997standards.html |archivedate=March 15, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In preparation for the United States 2010 Census, a marketing and outreach plan, called ''2010 Census Integrated Communications Campaign Plan'' (ICC) recognized and defined African Americans as black people born in the United States. From the ICC perspective, African Americans are one of three groups of black people in the United States.&lt;ref name="US2010ICCBlkAud"&gt;{{cite web|title=2010 Census Integrated Communications Campaign Plan|url=https://www.census.gov/2010census/partners/pdf/2010_ICC_Plan_Final_Edited.pdf|website=2010 Census|publisher=U.S. Census Bureau|page=225|format=PDF|date=August 2008|accessdate=September 6, 2012|quote=The Black audience includes all individuals of Black African descent. There are three major groups that represent the Black Audience in the United States. These groups are African Americans (Blacks born in the United States), Black Africans (Black Immigrants from Africa) and Afro-Caribbeans, which includes Haitians.|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130310013605/http://www.census.gov/2010census/partners/pdf/2010_ICC_Plan_Final_Edited.pdf|archive-date=March 10, 2013|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ICC plan was to reach the three groups by acknowledging that each group has its own sense of community that is based on geography and ethnicity.&lt;ref name="US2010ICCBstRch"&gt;{{cite web|title=2010 Census Integrated Communications Campaign Plan|url=https://www.census.gov/2010census/partners/pdf/2010_ICC_Plan_Final_Edited.pdf|website=2010 Census|publisher=U.S. Census Bureau|page=230|format=PDF|date=August 2008|accessdate=September 6, 2012|quote=Community, both geographic and ethnic, creates a sense of belonging and pride that is unique to the Black audience (African Americans, Afro-Caribbeans, and Black Africans).|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130310013605/http://www.census.gov/2010census/partners/pdf/2010_ICC_Plan_Final_Edited.pdf|archive-date=March 10, 2013|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The best way to market the census process toward any of the three groups is to reach them through their own unique communication channels and not treat the entire black population of the U.S. as though they are all African Americans with a single ethnic and geographical background. The U.S. Department of Justice Federal Bureau of Investigation categorizes black or African-American people as "A person having origins in any of the black racial groups of Africa" through racial categories used in the UCR Program adopted from the Statistical Policy Handbook (1978) and published by the Office of Federal Statistical Policy and Standards, U.S. Department of Commerce, derived from the 1977 Office of Management and Budget classification.&lt;ref name="FBIpop"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fbi.gov/about-us/cjis/ucr/additional-ucr-publications/ucr_handbook.pdf/view|title=Uniform Crime Reporting Handbook|publisher=U.S. Department of Justice.

Historically, "race mixing" between [[Black (people)|black]] and [[White American|white]] people was taboo in the United States. So-called [[anti-miscegenation laws]], barring blacks and whites from marrying or having sex, were established in [[colonial America]] as early as 1691,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=https://www.backintyme.com/essay050101.htm|title=The Invention of the Color Line: 1691—Essays on the Color Line and the One-Drop Rule |author=Frank W Sweet |publisher=Backentyme Essays|date=January 1, 2005|accessdate=January 4, 2008|deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070409160923/https://backintyme.com/essay050101.htm|archivedate=April 9, 2007|df=mdy}}&lt;/ref&gt; and endured in many Southern states until the Supreme Court ruled them unconstitutional in ''[[Loving v.

In her opinion, President [[Barack Obama]], who is the son of a Kenyan immigrant, although technically black, is not African-American.&lt;ref name="colorblind-salon"/&gt;&lt;ref name="colbertnation.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.colbertnation.com/the-colbert-report-videos/81955/february-08-2007/debra-dickerson?videoId=81955|title=The Colbert Report|author=Debra Dickerson|date=February 8, 2007|publisher=colbertnation.com|accessdate=October 7, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; She makes the argument that grouping all people of African descent together regardless of their unique ancestral circumstances would inevitably deny the lingering effects of slavery within the American community of slave descendants, in addition to denying black immigrants recognition of their own unique ancestral backgrounds. "Lumping us all together", Dickerson wrote, "erases the significance of slavery and continuing racism while giving the appearance of progress".&lt;ref name="colorblind-salon"/&gt;

Similar viewpoints have been expressed by [[Stanley Crouch]] in a ''[[New York Daily News]]'' piece, [[Charles Steele, Jr.]] of the [[Southern Christian Leadership Conference]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.ajc.com/metro/content/shared-blogs/ajc/politicalinsider/entries/2008/06/21/sclc_head_michelle_obama_treat.html|title=SCLC head: Michelle Obama treated more roughly than her husband, because of her slave heritage|work=[[Atlanta Journal Constitution]]|date=June 21, 2008|accessdate=April 20, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120608070924/http://www.ajc.com/metro/content/shared-blogs/ajc/politicalinsider/entries/2008/06/21/sclc_head_michelle_obama_treat.html|archive-date=June 8, 2012|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; and African-American columnist [[David Ehrenstein]] of the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', who accused white liberals of flocking to blacks who were ''[[Magic Negro]]s'', a term that refers to a black person with no past who simply appears to assist the mainstream white (as cultural protagonists/drivers) agenda.&lt;ref name="Obama the 'Magic Negro'"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.latimes.com/news/opinion/la-oe-ehrenstein19mar19,0,5335087.story?coll=la-opinion-center |work=Los Angeles Times|title=Obama the 'Magic Negro'|date=March 19, 2007|first=David|last=Ehrenstein}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ehrenstein went on to say "He's there to assuage white 'guilt' they feel over the role of slavery and racial segregation in American history."&lt;ref name="Obama the 'Magic Negro'"/&gt;

She has also rejected an immigrant designation for African Americans and instead prefers the term ''black'' or ''white'' to denote the African and European U.S. founding populations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://bbaaghs.org/news/?p=10|title=Book Excerpt: Condoleezza Rice: An American Life|author=[[Elisabeth Bumiller]]|date=December 22, 2007|accessdate=October 7, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Terms no longer in common use===
Before the independence of the [[Thirteen Colonies]] until the abolition of slavery in 1865, an African-American slave was commonly known as a ''[[negro]]''. ''[[Free negro]]'' was the legal status in the territory of an African-American person who was not a slave.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Frazier|first=Edward Franklin|title=The Free Negro Family|year=1968|pages=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term ''[[colored]]'' later also began to be used until the second quarter of the 20th century, when it was considered outmoded and generally gave way again to the exclusive use of ''negro''. By the 1940s, the term was commonly capitalized (''Negro''); but by the mid-1960s, it was considered disparaging. By the end of the 20th century, ''negro'' had come to be considered inappropriate and was rarely used and perceived as a [[pejorative]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Tottie|first=Gunnel|title=An Introduction to American English|url=https://books.google.com/?id=WWDUtK-f1tQC&amp;pg=PA200|year=2002|publisher=Blackwell Publishing|location=Oxford|isbn=978-0-631-19792-8|page=200}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Anderson|first=Talmadge|author2=James Stewart|title=Introduction to African American Studies|url=https://books.google.com/?id=49tXR1Ok6poC&amp;pg=PA3|year=2007|publisher=Black Classics Press|location=Baltimore|isbn=978-1-58073-039-6|page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term is rarely used by younger black people, but remained in use by many older African Americans who had grown up with the term, particularly in the southern U.S.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2010/03/they-put-negro-on-there/38094/|title=They Put 'Negro' on There?|author=Chris Good|date=March 26, 2010|website=[[The Atlantic]]|accessdate=October 7, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term remains in use in some contexts, such as the [[United Negro College Fund]], an American philanthropic organization that funds scholarships for black students and general scholarship funds for 39 private historically black colleges and universities.

There are many other deliberately insulting terms. Many were in common use (e.g., ''[[nigger]]''), but had become unacceptable in normal discourse before the end of the 20th century. One exception is the use, among the black community, of the slur ''nigger'' rendered as ''[[nigga]]'', representing the pronunciation of the word in [[African American English]]. This usage has been popularized by the [[rap]] and [[hip-hop]] music cultures and is used as part of an in-group lexicon and speech. It is not necessarily derogatory and, when used among black people, the word is often used to mean "[[homie]]" or "friend".{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}

Acceptance of intra-group usage of the word ''nigga'' is still debated, although it has established a foothold among younger generations. The [[NAACP]] denounces the use of both ''nigga'' and ''nigger''. Mixed-race usage of ''nigga'' is still considered taboo, particularly if the speaker is white. However, trends indicate that usage of the term in intragroup settings is increasing even among white youth due to the popularity of rap and hip hop culture.&lt;ref name=ENQ&gt;Kevin Aldridge, Richelle Thompson and Earnest Winston, [https://www.enquirer.com/editions/2001/08/05/loc_1the_n-word.html "The evolving N-word"], ''The Cincinnati Enquirer'', August 5, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Air quality laws'''&lt;section begin=overview /&gt;&lt;!-- This paragraph is transcluded to [[Environmental law]]. --&gt; govern the emission of [[air pollution|air pollutants]] into the [[atmosphere]]. A specialized subset of air quality laws regulate [[Indoor air quality|the quality of air inside buildings]]. Air quality laws are often designed specifically to protect human health by limiting or eliminating airborne pollutant concentrations. Other initiatives are designed to address broader ecological problems, such as limitations on chemicals that affect the [[ozone layer]], and [[emissions trading]] programs to address [[acid rain]] or [[global warming|climate change]]. Regulatory efforts include identifying and categorizing air pollutants, setting limits on acceptable emissions levels, and dictating necessary or appropriate mitigation technologies.&lt;section end=overview /&gt;

{{TOC limit|2}}

== Air pollutant classification ==

Air quality regulation must identify the substances and energies which qualify as "[[pollution]]" for purposes of further control. While specific labels vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, there is broad consensus among many governments regarding what constitutes air pollution. For example, the United States Clean Air Act identifies [[ozone]], [[particulate matter]], [[carbon monoxide]], [[nitrogen oxides]] (NO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;), [[sulfur dioxide]] (SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), and [[lead]] (Pb) as "criteria" pollutants requiring nationwide regulation.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. EPA, [http://www.epa.gov/airquality/urbanair/ What Are the Six Common Air Pollutants?]&lt;/ref&gt; EPA has also identified over 180 compounds it has classified as "hazardous" pollutants requiring strict control.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. EPA, [http://www.epa.gov/ttn/atw/188polls.html Original list of hazardous air pollutants].&lt;/ref&gt; Other compounds have been identified as air pollutants due to their adverse impact on the environment (e.g., [[CFCs]] as agents of [[ozone depletion]]), and on human health (e.g., [[asbestos]] in indoor air).&lt;ref&gt;U.S. EPA, [http://www.epa.gov/air/airpollutants.html Air Pollutants] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140623135256/http://www.epa.gov/air/airpollutants.html |date=June 23, 2014 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; A broader conception of air pollution may also incorporate [[noise pollution|noise]], [[light pollution|light]], and [[radon|radiation]]. The United States has recently seen controversy over whether [[carbon dioxide]] (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) and other [[greenhouse gases]] should be classified as air pollutants.&lt;ref&gt;See ''[[Massachusetts v. Environmental Protection Agency]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Air quality standards ==

Air quality standards are legal standards or requirements governing concentrations of [[Air pollution|air pollutants]] in breathed air, both outdoors and indoors. Such standards generally are expressed as levels of specific air pollutants that are deemed acceptable in ambient air, and are most often designed to reduce or eliminate the human health effects of air pollution, although secondary effects such as crop and building damage may also be considered.&lt;ref&gt;See generally U.S. EPA, [http://www.epa.gov/airquality/cleanair.html Air Quality].&lt;/ref&gt; Determining appropriate air quality standards generally requires up-to-date scientific data on the health effects of the pollutant under review, with specific information on exposure times and sensitive populations. It also generally requires periodic or continuous monitoring of air quality.

As an example, the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] has developed the [[National Ambient Air Quality Standards]] (NAAQS)&lt;ref&gt;See U.S. EPA [http://www.epa.gov/air/criteria.html NAAQS] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101210101749/http://www.epa.gov/air/criteria.html |date=2010-12-10 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; NAAQS set attainment thresholds for [[sulfur dioxide]], [[particulate matter]] (PM&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt; and PM&lt;sub&gt;2.5&lt;/sub&gt;), [[carbon monoxide]], [[ozone]], [[nitrogen oxide]]s NO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;, and [[lead]] (Pb) in outdoor air throughout the United States. Another set of standards, for indoor air in employment settings, is administered by the U.S. [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration]].&lt;ref&gt;See U.S. OSHA, [https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/indoorairquality/ Indoor Air Quality].&lt;/ref&gt;

A distinction may be made between mandatory and aspirational air quality standards. For example, U.S. state governments must work toward achieving NAAQS, but are not forced to meet them. On the other hand, employers may be required immediately to rectify any violation of OSHA workplace air quality standards.

== Emission standards==

{{Main article|Emission standard}}

Emission standards {{#section:emission standard|overview}}

Numerous methods exist for determining appropriate emissions standards, and different regulatory approaches may be taken depending on the source, industry, and [[air pollution|air pollutant]] under review.&lt;ref&gt;See generally, U.S. EPA [http://www.epa.gov/airquality/emissns.html Emissions] page.&lt;/ref&gt; Specific limits may be set by reference to and within the confines of more general air quality standards. Specific sources may be regulated by means of performance standards, meaning numerical limits on the emission of a specific pollutant from that source category. Regulators may also mandate the adoption and use of specific control technologies, often with reference to feasibility, availability, and cost. Still other standards may be set using performance as a benchmark - for example, requiring all of a specific type of facility to meet the emissions limits achieved by the best performing facility of the group. All of these methods may be modified by incorporating emissions averaging, market mechanisms such as emissions trading, and other alternatives.

For example, all of these approaches are used in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;See generally, U.S. EPA, [http://www.epa.gov/air/caa/standards_technology.html Setting Emissions Standards Based on Technology Performance], [http://www.epa.gov/air/caa/flexibility.html Building Flexibility with Accountability into Clean Air Programs], and linked materials.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] (responsible for air quality regulation at a national level under the [[Clean Air Act (United States)|U.S. Clean Air Act]], utilizes performance standards under the [[New Source Performance Standard]] (NSPS) program. Technology requirements are set under RACT (Reasonably Available Control Technology), BACT (Best Available Control Technology), and LAER (Lowest Achievable Emission Rate) standards.&lt;ref&gt;See U.S. EPA, [http://www.epa.gov/airquality/emission.html Emissions] page.&lt;/ref&gt;  Flexibility alternatives are implemented in U.S. programs to eliminate [[acid rain]], protect the [[ozone layer]], achieve permitting standards, and reduce greenhouse gas emissions.&lt;ref&gt;See U.S. EPA, [http://www.epa.gov/greeningepa/ghg/ EPA's Greenhouse Gas Emissions Reductions].&lt;/ref&gt;

== Control technology requirements ==

In place of or in combination with air quality standards and emission control standards, governments may choose to reduce air pollution by requiring regulated parties to adopt emissions control technologies (i.e., technology that reduces or eliminates emissions). Such devices include but are not limited to [[gas flare|flare stacks]], [[Incineration|incinerators]], [[catalytic combustion]] reactors, [[selective catalytic reduction]] reactors, [[electrostatic precipitator]]s, [[baghouse]]s, [[wet scrubber]]s, [[Cyclonic separation|cyclones]], [[thermal oxidizer]]s, [[Venturi scrubber]]s, [[Adsorption#Activated carbon|carbon adsorbers]], and [[biofilter]]s.

The selection of emissions control technology may be the subject of complex regulation that may balance multiple conflicting considerations and interests, including economic cost, availability, feasibility, and effectiveness.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, U.S. EPA's [http://www.epa.gov/ttnatw01/boiler/boilerpg.html Industrial Boiler] process and linked materials.&lt;/ref&gt; The various weight given to each factor may ultimately determine the technology selected. The outcome of an analysis seeking a technology that all players in an industry can afford could be different from an analysis seeking to require all players to adopt the most effective technology yet developed, regardless of cost. For example, the [[United States Clean Air Act]] contains several control technology requirements, including Best Available Control Technology (BACT) (used in [[New Source Review]]), Reasonably Available Control Technology (RACT) (existing sources), Lowest Achievable Emissions Rate (LAER) (used for major new sources in non-attainment areas), and Maximum Achievable Control Technology (MACT) standards.

==Bans==

Air quality laws may take the form of bans. While arguably a class of emissions control law (where the emission limit is set to zero), bans differ in that they may regulate activity other than the emission of a pollutant itself, even though the ultimate goal is to eliminate the emission of the pollutant.

A common example is a burn ban.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., [http://www.pscleanair.org/priorities/woodheating/Pages/burnbans.aspx Puget Sound Air Resources Board Burn Bans].&lt;/ref&gt; Residential and commercial burning of wood materials may be restricted during times of poor air quality, eliminating the immediate emission of particulate matter and requiring use of non-polluting heating methods. A more significant example is the widespread ban on the manufacture of [[dichlorodifluoromethane]] ([[Freon]])), formerly the standard refrigerant in automobile air conditioning systems. This substance, often released into the atmosphere unintentionally as a result of refrigerant system leaks, was determined to have a significant [[ozone depletion potential]], and its widespread use to pose a significant threat to the Earth's [[ozone layer]]. Its manufacture was prohibited as part of a suite of restrictions adopted internationally in the [[Montreal Protocol]] to the [[Vienna Convention for the Protection of the Ozone Layer]]. Still another example is the ban on use of [[asbestos]] in building construction materials, to eliminate future exposure to carcinogenic asbestos fibers when the building materials are disturbed.

==Data collection and access==

Air quality laws may impose substantial requirements for collecting, storing, submitting, and providing access to technical data for various purposes, including regulatory enforcement, public health programs, and policy development.

Data collection processes may include [[Environmental monitoring#Air quality monitoring|monitoring ambient air]] for the presence of pollutants, directly monitoring emissions sources, or collecting other quantitative information from which air quality information may be deduced. For example, local agencies may employ a [[particulate matter sampler]] to determine ambient air quality in a locality over time. Fossil power plants may required to monitor emissions at a [[flue-gas stack]] to determine quantities of relevant pollutants emitted. Automobile manufacturers may be required to collect data regarding car sales, which, when combined with technical specifications regarding fuel consumption and efficiency, may be used to estimate total vehicle emissions. In each case, data collection may be short- or long-term, and at varying frequency (e.g., hourly, daily).

Air quality laws may include detailed requirements for recording, storing, and submitting relevant information, generally with the ultimate goal of standardizing data practices in order to facilitate data access and manipulation at a later time.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example [http://www.mass.gov/eea/agencies/massdep/air/approvals/operating-permits-forms.html Massachusetts EPA Air Permit &amp; Reporting Toolkit Forms].&lt;/ref&gt; Precise requirements may be very difficult to determine without technical training and may change over time in response to, for example, changes in law, changes in policy, changes in available technology, and changes in industry practice. Such requirements may be developed at a national level and reflect consensus or compromise between government agencies, regulated industry, and public interest groups.

Once air quality data are collected and submitted, some air quality laws may require government agencies or private parties to provide the public with access to the information - whether the raw data alone, or via tools to make the data more useful, accessible, and understandable. Where public access mandates are general, it may be left to the collecting agency to decide whether and to what extent the data is to be centralized and organized. For example, the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]], [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]], [[National Park Service]], and tribal, state, and local agencies coordinate to produce an online mapping and data access tool called [http://airnow.gov AirNow], which provides real-time public access to U.S. [[air quality index]] information, searchable by location.

Once data are collected and published, they may be used as inputs in mathematical models and forecasts. For example, [[atmospheric dispersion modeling]] may be employed to examine the potential impact of new regulatory requirements on existing populations or geographic areas. Such models in turn could drive changes in data collection and reporting requirements.

==Controversy==

Proponents  of air quality law argue that they have caused or contributed to major reductions in [[air pollution]], with concomitant human health and environmental benefits, even in the face of large-scale economic growth and increases in motor vehicle use.&lt;ref&gt;See Union of Concerned Scientists, [http://www.ucsusa.org/global_warming/solutions/reduce-emissions/the-clean-air-act.html The Clean Air Act].&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, controversy may arise over the estimated cost of additional regulatory standards.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., W. Koch, [http://content.usatoday.com/communities/greenhouse/post/2011/10/obama-epa-sued-ozone-standard-asthma/1 Obama, EPA sued for nixing tougher ozone rules] (USA Today).&lt;/ref&gt;

Arguments over cost, however, cut both ways. For example, the "estimates that the benefits of reducing fine particle and ground level ozone pollution under the 1990 Clean Air Act amendments will reach approximately $2 trillion in 2020 while saving 230,000 people from early death in that year alone." According to the same report, 2010 alone the reduction of ozone and particulate matter in the atmosphere prevented more than 160,000 cases of premature mortality, 130,000 heart attacks, 13 million lost work days and 1.7 million asthma attacks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=EPA Report Underscores Clean Air Act’s Successful Public Health Protections/Landmark law saved 160,000 lives in 2010 alone|url=http://yosemite.epa.gov/opa/admpress.nsf/7ebdf4d0b217978b852573590040443a/f8ad3485e788be5a8525784600540649!OpenDocument|publisher=EPA.gov|accessdate=22 March 2012|author=Enesta Jones|date=2011-03-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Criticisms of EPA's methodologies in reaching these and similar numbers are publicly available.&lt;ref&gt;See generally EPA air quality dockets at www.regulations.gov.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Around the world==

=== International law===

[[International law]] includes agreements related to trans-national air quality, including greenhouse gas emissions:
{{#section:List of international environmental agreements|air treaties}}

===Canada===
With some industry-specific exceptions, Canadian air pollution regulation was traditionally handled at the provincial level.&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.blakesfiles.com/Guides/2012_Blakes_Environmental_Law_in_Canada_EN.pdf Environmental Law in Canada, Blakes Lawyers (2012)].&lt;/ref&gt; However, under the authority of the [[Canadian Environmental Protection Act, 1999]], the country has recently enacted a national program called the Canadian Air Quality Management System (AQMS). The program includes five main regulatory mechanisms: the Canadian Ambient Air Quality Standards (CAAQS); Base Level Industrial Emission Requirements (BLIERs) (emissions controls and technology); management of local air quality through the management of Local Air Zones; management of regional air quality through the management of Regional Airsheds; and collaboration to reduce mobile source emissions.&lt;ref&gt;Overview available at [http://www.env.gov.nl.ca/env/env_protection/science/aqms.html Newfoundland Labrador Department of Environment and Conservation].&lt;/ref&gt;

The Canadian government has also made efforts to pass legislation related to the country's greenhouse gas emissions. It has passed laws related to fuel economy in passenger vehicles and light trucks, heavy-duty vehicles, renewable fuels, and the energy and transportation sectors.&lt;ref&gt;See [www.climatechange.gc.ca Canada's Action on Climate Change].&lt;/ref&gt;

===China===
China, with severe air pollution in mega-cities and industrial centers, particularly in the north, has adapted the Airborne Pollution Prevention and Control Action Plan which aims for a 25% reduction in air pollution by 2017 from 2012 levels. Funded by $277 billion from the central government, the action plan targets [[Particulates|PM 2.5]] particulates which affect human health.&lt;ref name=China91613&gt;{{cite web|title=Airborne Pollution Prevention and Control Action Plan (2013-17)|url=http://www.china.org.cn/environment/2013-08/16/content_29742881.htm|publisher=China.org.cn|accessdate=December 10, 2014|date=August 16, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===New Zealand===
New Zealand passed its [[Clean Air Act 1972]] in response to growing concerns over industrial and urban air pollution.&lt;ref&gt;Historical information in this section adapted from [http://www.mfe.govt.nz/publications/environmental-reporting/state-new-zealand%E2%80%99s-environment-1997 The State of New Zealand’s Environment 1997], Chapter 6.&lt;/ref&gt; That Act classified sources, imposed permitting requirements, and created a process for determining requisite control technology. Local authorities were authorized to regulate smaller polluters. Within the Christchurch Clean Air Zone, burn bans and other measures were effected to control smog.

The [[Clean Air Act 1972]] was replaced by the [[Resource Management Act 1991]]. The act did not set air quality standards, but did provide for national guidance to be developed. This resulted in the promulgation of New Zealand's National Environmental Standards for Air Quality in 2004 with subsequent amendments.&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.mfe.govt.nz/air/national-environmental-standards-air-quality/about-nes About the NES].&lt;/ref&gt;

===United Kingdom===
In response to the [[Great Smog of 1952]], the [[British Parliament]] introduced the [[Clean Air Act 1956]]. This act legislated for zones where [[smokeless fuel]]s had to be burnt and relocated power stations to rural areas. The 
Clean Air Act 1968&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://wiredforbooks.org/richardadams |title=Watership Down author Richard Adams mentions his role in the Clean Air Act 1968 |access-date=2010-01-16 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100109103929/http://wiredforbooks.org/richardadams/ |archive-date=2010-01-09 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; introduced the use of tall chimneys to [[Atmospheric dispersion modeling|disperse air pollution]] for industries burning coal, liquid or gaseous fuels.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.ace.mmu.ac.uk/eae/Air_Quality/Older/Clean_Air_Acts.html |title=United Kingdom's Clean Air Acts |access-date=2010-01-16 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100126040145/http://www.ace.mmu.ac.uk/eae/Air_Quality/Older/Clean_Air_Acts.html |archive-date=2010-01-26 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The Clean Air Act was updated in 1993 and can be reviewed online [http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1993/11/contents legislation Clean Air Act 1993]. The biggest domestic impact comes from Part III, Smoke Control Areas, which are designated by local authorities and can vary by street in large towns.

===United States===
{{Main article|Clean Air Act (United States)}}
{{See also|United States environmental law}}
The primary law regulating air quality in the United States is the [[Clean Air Act (United States)|U.S. Clean Air Act]]. The law was initially enacted as the [[Air Pollution Control Act of 1955]]. Amendments in 1967 and 1970 (the framework for today's [[Clean Air Act (United States)|U.S. Clean Air Act]]) imposed national air quality requirements, and placed administrative responsibility with the newly created Environmental Protection Agency. Major amendments followed in 1977 and 1990. State and local governments have enacted similar legislation, either implementing federal programs or filling in locally important gaps in federal programs.

'''''Animal Fairy Tales''''' is a collection of short stories written by [[L. Frank Baum]], the creator of the [[Land of Oz]] series of children's books. The stories (animal tales, comparable to [[Aesop's Fables]] or the ''[[Just-So Stories]]'' and ''[[The Jungle Book|Jungle Book]]'' of [[Rudyard Kipling]]) first received magazine publication in [[1905 in literature|1905]]. For several decades in the twentieth century, the collection was a "lost" book by Baum; it resurfaced when the [[International Wizard of Oz Club]] published the stories in one volume in 1969.&lt;ref&gt;L. Frank Baum, ''Animal Fairy Tales'', Introduction by Russell P. McFall; Hong Kong, International Wizard of Oz Club and Opium Books, 1969; second edition, International Wizard of Oz Club, 1989.&lt;/ref&gt;

The nine stories in the collection were printed in consecutive monthly issues of ''[[The Delineator]]'' (a popular women's magazine of the time) from January to September 1905. The tales were part of the magazine's regular feature, "Stories and Pastimes for Children", and primarily illustrated by [[Charles Livingston Bull]];&lt;ref&gt;''Animal Fairy Tales'', 1989, Introduction, p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Delineator'' published Baum's story "[[A Kidnapped Santa Claus]]" in December 1904 with illustrations by Frederick Richardson, who had begun illustrating Baum's serialized novel ''Queen Zixi of Ix'' the previous month in ''St. Nicholas''.

Baum favored book publication for the stories; when his health declined in 1918, he worked to prepare books for future publication in the event of his death. Baum readied three manuscripts, so his publisher ([[Reilly &amp; Britton]]) could issue annual Baum books through 1921. Two of those books were the last two in his [[List of Oz books|Oz series]] (''[[The Magic of Oz]]'' and ''[[Glinda of Oz]]''), which were published in 1919 and 1920; the third book was ''Animal Fairy Tales''.&lt;ref&gt;L. Frank Baum, ''The Annotated Wizard of Oz'', Edited with an Introduction and Notes by [[Michael Patrick Hearn]]; revised edition, New York, W. W. Norton, 2000; Introduction, p. lxxxiv.&lt;/ref&gt; It is unknown why Reilly &amp; Britton did not publish the latter.

==Contents==
The collection consists of:
* "Prologue" (originally published January 1905)
* "The Story of Jaglon" (January 1905)
* "The Stuffed Alligator" (February 1905)
* "The Discontented Gopher" (March 1905)
* "The Forest Oracle" (April 1905)
* "The Enchanted Buffalo" (May 1905)
* "The Pea-Green Poodle" (June 1905)
* "The Jolly Giraffe of Jomb" (July 1905)
* "The Troubles of Pop Wombat" (August 1905)
* "The Transformation of Bayal the Porcupine" (September 1905)

Of the stories, "The Enchanted Buffalo" is the most-frequently anthologized.&lt;ref&gt;As in: ''Masterpieces of Fantasy and Wonder'', Compiled by David G. Hartwell, New York, Doubleday, 1989; and ''The American Fantasy Tradition'', Edited by Brian M. Thomsen, New York, Macmillan, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; The stories were probably written in 1903 and 1904; they resemble other animal tales that Baum wrote during the same period, some of which appeared in his ''[[American Fairy Tales]]'' (1901), ''[[The Twinkle Tales]]'' (1906) and as episodes in his novels.&lt;ref&gt;''Animal Fairy Tales'', 1989, Introduction, pp. 5-6.&lt;/ref&gt; Baum's animal tales employ his highly-imaginative style (influenced by his interest in [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|theosophy]]), and differ from the more-naturalistic tales of contemporaries such as [[Albert Bigelow Paine]]. In "The Story of Jaglon," for example, an orphaned tiger is raised by "tiger fairies." In 1953, Oz author [[Jack Snow (writer)|Jack Snow's]] expansion of this story (entitled ''Jaglon and the Tiger Fairies'') was published with illustrations by Dale Ulrey. This was the first in a series of expanded versions of all nine stories planned by [[Reilly &amp; Lee]], but the other eight were never published.

Baum wrote another story for the collection; entitled "[[The Tiger's Eye]]", it is a grim, harsh story about evil magic enchanting animals and men which was not printed until 1962.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1428">The '''Bukhara State Architectural Art Museum-Preserve''' is a [[museum]] in [[Bukhara]], [[Uzbekistan]]. It was founded in 1922 and contains archaeological and historical material relating to the region of Bukhara.

==Collections==
The museum has a collection of 19,162 objects. These are mostly coins excavated in Bukhara and the surrounding area. Coins and currency circulating in Uzbekistan from the third century BC (the [[Greco-Bactrian_Kingdom]]) to the present day are represented.

Publications have been made on nineteenth and twentieth century popular women's jewellery that mixed silver coins with pearls, beads and silver decorations. These ornaments, known as ''tillo kosh'' or ''sinsila'', were often worn by brides as symbols of prosperity and fertility.&lt;ref&gt;Niyazova, M I: "Coin in Jewellery from Bukhara" in ''Proceedings of the 13th Numismatic Congress, Madrid, 2003''&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Vincenzo Camuccini - La morte di Cesare.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|Death of Caesar, the well-known climax of [[Shakespeare]]'s play, ''[[Julius Caesar (play)|Julius Caesar]]'']]

The '''climax''' (from the [[Ancient Greek language|Greek]] word ''κλῖμαξ'', meaning "staircase" and "ladder") or '''turning point''' of a [[narrative|narrative work]] is its point of highest tension and drama, or it is the time when the action starts during which the solution is given.&lt;ref Name="Herrick"&gt;{{cite book  |author1=Robert Herrick |author2=Lindsay Todd Damon  | title = Composition and Rhetoric for Schools  | publisher = Scott, Foresman and Co.  | year=  1902  | location = Original from Harvard University  | pages = 382  | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=XwABAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA382&amp;dq=Climax+(narrative)+-wikipedia&amp;ie=ISO-8859-1   | doi =    }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref Name="Fletcher"&gt;{{cite book  |author1=Jefferson Butler Fletcher |author2=George Rice Carpenter  | title = Introduction to Theme-writing  | publisher = Allyn &amp; Bacon  | year=  1893  | location = Original from Harvard University  | pages = 84  | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=dP0AAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA84&amp;dq=Climax+(narrative)+-wikipedia&amp;ie=ISO-8859-1  | doi =    }}&lt;/ref&gt; The climax of a story is a [[literary element]].

== Examples ==
The [[punch line]] of a [[joke]] is an analogy for the climax of a fictional narrative, though the absence of any [[falling action]] is an essential difference, which may reflect the nature of [[humor]] as opposed to the nature of [[drama]].

In non-fictional narrative [[genre]]s, even though the author does not have the same freedom to control the action and "plot" as in works of fiction, the selection of subject matter, degree of detail, and emphasis permit an author to create similar structures, i.e., to construct a dramatization.

In the play ''[[Hippolytus (play)|Hippolytus]]'', by the famous Greek playwright, [[Euripides]], the climax arrives when Phaedra hears Hippolytus react badly because of her love for him. That is the moment that [[Aphrodite]]'s curse is finally fulfilled, and it is the turning point of the play.

== {{anchor|Anti-climax}} Anticlimax ==
An anticlimax is a situation in a plot in which something which would appear to be difficult to solve is solved through something trivial. For example, destroying a heavily guarded facility would require advanced technology, teamwork, and weaponry for a climax, but for an anticlimax, it may just require pushing a red button which reads, "Emergency Self-Destruct", or simply filling out an eviction notice and destroying the building. A famous example is the ending of ''[[The War of the Worlds]]'', where amidst the chaos of the extraterrestrial takeover of planet [[Earth]], the aliens are defeated by the most unexpected organism: the common cold virus. Another example could involve the protagonist faced with insurmountable odds and ultimately being killed without accomplishing his goal, despite what appears to be a turning point for the character.

The '''Commander Islands''' or '''Komandorski Islands''' or '''Komandorskie Islands''' ({{lang-ru|Командо́рские острова́}}, ''Komandorskiye ostrova'') are a group of treeless, sparsely populated [[island]]s in the [[Bering Sea]] located about {{convert|175|km|mi}} east of the [[Kamchatka Peninsula]] in the [[Russian Far East]]. The islands consist of [[Bering Island]] ({{convert|95|km|mi}} by {{convert|15|km|mi}}), [[Medny Island]] ({{convert|55|km|mi}} by {{convert|5|km|mi}}) and fifteen smaller ones ([[islets]] and rocks), the largest of which are ''[[Tufted Puffin Rock]] (Kamen Toporkov'' or ''Ostrov Toporkov)'', {{convert|15|ha|acres}}, and ''Kamen Ariy'', which are between {{convert|3|km|mi}} and {{convert|13|km|mi}} west of the only settlement, [[Nikolskoye, Kamchatka Krai|Nikolskoye]]. [[Administrative divisions of Kamchatka Krai|Administratively]], they compose [[Aleutsky District]] of [[Kamchatka Krai]] in Russia.

== Geography ==
[[File:txu-oclc-6654394-nn-58-3rd-ed.jpg|thumb|right|350px|Detailed map including the Commander Islands]]

The Commander Islands are the westernmost extension of the [[Aleutian Islands]], most of which are part of the US state of [[Alaska]], though they are separated from the closest US island, [[Attu Island]], and the rest of the chain by {{convert|207|mi|km}}. Between the two runs the [[International Date Line]]. The relief is somewhat diverse, encompassing folded-block mountains, [[volcanic plateau]]s, terraced plains and low mountains. The geologic origins are long-extinct [[volcano]]es on the edge of the [[Pacific plate|Pacific]] and [[North American Plate]]s. The highest point is Steller Peak on Bering Island at {{convert|755|m|ft|0}}. The highest point on Medny Island is Stenjeger's Peak at {{convert|647|m|ft|0}}.

The climate is relatively mild and maritime, with frequent precipitation (220–240&amp;nbsp;days/year). The cool summers are notoriously foggy.

== Population ==
[[File:Nikolskoe komandor island.jpg|thumb|Nikolskoye]]
The only permanently inhabited locality is the village of [[Nikolskoye, Kamchatka Krai|Nikolskoye]] on the northwest end of Bering Island, with an estimated population of&amp;nbsp;613 {{As of|2009|lc=y}}. This consists almost entirely of Russians and [[Aleut people|Aleut]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Derbeneva |first1=OA |last2=Sukernik |first2=RI |last3=Volodko |first3=NV |last4=Hosseini |first4=SH |last5=Lott |first5=MT |last6=Wallace |first6=DC |year=2002 |title=Analysis of Mitochondrial DNA Diversity in the Aleuts of the Commander Islands and Its Implications for the Genetic History of Beringia |url= |journal=[[American Journal of Human Genetics]] |volume=71 |issue=2| pages=415–21 |doi=10.1086/341720 |pmid=12082644 |pmc=379174 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The majority of the islands' area, as well as much of the adjacent marine habitat ({{convert|14088|sqmi|km2|0}}), is taken up by the [[Komandorsky Zapovednik]], a natural preserve. The economy is based primarily on fishing, [[mushroom gathering]], the administration of the [[zapovednik]], [[ecotourism]] and government services.

The village has a school, a satellite tracking station and a dirt airstrip south of the village.

The other settlements on the two islands are small villages or scattering of houses:

* Severnoye
* Podutesnaya
* Gladkovskeya
* Lisennova
* Peschanka
* Preobrajenskoe Settlement at Peschanaya Bay on Medniy Island – abandoned
* Glinka

[[File:О. Медный 456547.jpg|thumb|Medny Island]]
Due to the high productivity of the Bering Sea shelf and the Pacific slope and their remoteness from human influence, the Commander Islands are marked by a great abundance of marine animal life and a relative paucity of terrestrial organisms.&lt;ref name=BN&gt;{{cite journal |last=Barabash-Nikiforov |first=I. |title=Mammals of the Commander Islands and the Surrounding Sea |journal=Journal of Mammalogy |volume=19 |issue=4  |pages=423–429 |date=November 1938 |doi=10.2307/1374226 |jstor=1374226}}&lt;/ref&gt; Notably, significant numbers of [[northern fur seal]]s (some 200,000 individuals) and [[Steller sea lion]]s (approximately 5,000 individuals) summer there, both on reproductive rookeries and non-reproductive haul-outs. [[Sea otter]]s, [[common seal]]s and [[spotted seal|larga seals]] are likewise abundant. Indeed, the [[sea otter]] population is stable and possibly increasing, even as their population is falling precipitously in the rest of the Aleutian islands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Doroff |first=A. |author2=J.A. Estes |author3=M.T. Tinker|title=Sea otter population declines in the Aleutian archipelago |journal=Journal of Mammalogy |volume=84 |issue=1 |pages=55–64 |date=February 2003 |doi=10.1644/1545-1542(2003)084&lt;0055:SOPDIT&gt;2.0.CO;2 |issn=1545-1542|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The neighboring waters provide important feeding, wintering and migrating habitat for many whale species, many of which are threatened or endangered. Among these are: [[sperm whale]]s, [[orca]]s, several species of [[beaked whale]]s and [[porpoise]]s, [[humpback whale|humpbacks]] and endangered species such as the [[North Pacific right whale]]s&lt;ref name="BN" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://komandorsky.ru/eubalaena-japonica-lacepede.html|title=Командорский - Японский гладкий кит Eubalaena japonica Lacepede, 1818|author=|date=|website=komandorsky.ru|accessdate=18 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[fin whale]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://komandorsky.ru/balaenoptera-physalus.html|title=Командорский - Финвал (сельдяной кит) Balaenoptera physalus (Linnaeus, 1758)|author=|date=|website=komandorsky.ru|accessdate=18 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The much less diverse terrestrial fauna includes two distinct, endemic subspecies of [[Arctic fox]], (''Alopex lagopus semenovi'' and ''A. l. beringensis''). Though relatively healthy now, these populations had been significantly depleted in the past due to the fur trade. Most other terrestrial species, including wild [[reindeer]], [[American mink]] and [[rat]]s have all been introduced to the islands by man.&lt;ref name=BN/&gt;

Over a million seabirds gather to nest on numerous large colonies along almost all the coastal cliffs. The most common are [[northern fulmar]]; [[Common guillemot|common]], [[Brunnich's guillemot|brunnich's]] and [[pigeon guillemot]]s; [[Horned puffin|horned]] and [[tufted puffin]]s; [[cormorants]]; [[gulls]]; and [[kittiwakes]] including the extremely local [[red-legged kittiwake]] which nests in only a few other colonies in the world. [[Waterfowl]] and [[sandpiper]]s are also abundant along the pre-lake depressions and river valleys of Bering Island, though largely absent from Medny Island. Migratory birds of note with critical nesting or feeding habitat on the islands include such species as [[Steller's eider]], [[Pacific golden plover]] and [[Aleutian tern]]. Raptors of note include the rare [[Steller's sea eagle]] and [[gyrfalcon]]. In total, over 180 bird species have been registered on the Commander Islands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Johansen |first=H. |title=Revised List of the Birds of the Commander Islands |journal=The Auk |volume=78 |issue=1 |pages=44–56 |date=January 1961 |jstor=4082233}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Бухта Буяна 1.JPG|thumb|Bering Island]]
The fish fauna in the mountainous, fast running streams is composed primarily of migratory [[salmonids]], including [[Arctic char]], [[Dolly Varden trout|Dolly Varden]], [[westslope cutthroat trout|black spotted trout]], [[Chinook salmon|chinook]], [[sockeye salmon|sockeye]], [[coho]] and [[pink salmon]].

Bering Island was the only known habitat of [[Steller's sea cow]]s, an immense (over 4000&amp;nbsp;kg) [[sirenian]] similar to the [[manatee]]. The sea cow was hunted to [[extinction]] within 27 years of its discovery in 1741.&lt;ref name="Anderson1995"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Anderson |first=P. |year=1995 |title=Competition, predation, and the evolution and extinction of Steller's sea cow, ''Hydrodamalis gigas'' |journal=Marine Mammal Science |volume=11 |pages=391–394 |doi=10.1111/j.1748-7692.1995.tb00294.x |issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[spectacled cormorant]], a large essentially flightless bird in the cormorant family, was similarly driven to extinction by around 1850.&lt;ref&gt;{{IUCN2006 |assessor='''BirdLife International''' |year=2004 |id=16841 |title=Phalacrocorax perspicillatus |downloaded=10 May 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is no true forest on the Commander Islands. The vegetation is dominated by [[lichen]]s, [[moss]]es and different associations of marshy plants with low grass and dwarf trees. Very tall [[umbellifer]]s are also common.

There are no [[amphibians]] or [[reptiles]] on the Commander Islands.&lt;ref name=BN/&gt;

== History ==
[[File:Bering Island Aleuts.jpg|thumb|right|Group of [[Aleut people|Aleut]] hunters from [[Bering Island]] ([[Circa|c.]] 1884–1886)]]

The Commander Islands received their name from Commander [[Vitus Bering]], whose ship ''St. Peter'' wrecked on the otherwise uninhabited Bering Island on [[Second Kamchatka Expedition|his return voyage]] from [[Alaska]] in 1741. Bering died on the island along with much of the crew. His grave is marked by a modest monument. About half of the crew did manage to survive the winter, thanks in part to the abundance of wildlife (notably the newly discovered Steller's sea cow) and the efforts of naturalist and physician [[Georg Wilhelm Steller]], who cured many of the men of [[scurvy]] by compelling them to eat seaweed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Steller |first=G.W. |editor=O.W. Frost |title=Journal of a Voyage with Bering, 1741–1742 |others=M. A. Engel; O. W. Frost (trans.) |publisher=Stanford University Press |year=1988 |location=Stanford |isbn=0-8047-2181-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually, a smaller boat was built from the remains of the ''St.&amp;nbsp;Peter'' and the survivors found their way back to Kamchatka, heavily laden with valuable sea otter pelts. The discovery of the sea otters sparked the great rush of fur-seeking "''Promyshlenniky''" which drove the Russian expansion into Alaska. Steller's sea cow, whose habitat was apparently restricted to the kelp-beds around Bering Island, was exterminated by 1768.

[[File:1966 CPA 3446.jpg|thumb|right|250px|1966 Soviet postage stamp depicting [[Vitus Bering|Bering's]] second voyage and the discovery of the Commander Islands]]
[[Aleut people|Aleut]] (Unangan) people were transferred to the Commander Islands early in 1825 by the [[Russian-American Company]] from the [[Aleutian Islands|Aleutians]] for the [[Seal hunting|seal trade]]. Most of the Aleuts inhabiting Bering Island came from [[Atka Island]] and those who lived on Medny Island came from [[Attu Island]], now both American possessions. A [[mixed language]] called [[Medny Aleut language|Mednyj Aleut]], with Aleut roots but Russian verb inflection, developed among the inhabitants. Today the population of the islands is about ⅔ Russian and ⅓ Aleut.

The 1943 [[Battle of the Komandorski Islands]] took place in the open sea about {{convert|160|km|mi|sp=us}} south of the islands.&lt;ref&gt;Lorelli, John A. (1984) ''The Battle of the Komandorski Islands, March 1943''. Annapolis, Md: Naval Institute Press, {{ISBN|0-87021-093-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Position statements===
CNI issues position statements, articles and recommendations on Middle East-related issues and is quoted in mainstream and Middle East media. In 1988 CNI President Eugene Bird wrote about Israel's ignoring United States [[State Department]] complaints about detention and possible torture of U.S. citizens.&lt;ref&gt;Eugene Bird, [http://www.wrmea.com/backissues/1098/9810022.html "Israel Ignores U.S. Protests Over Torture, Detention Of Young American Citizen in Israeli Prison"], ''[[Washington Report on Middle East Affairs]]'', October–November 1998, pages 22, 102.&lt;/ref&gt; In early 2002, Eugene Bird criticized then-[[United States President]] [[George W. Bush]] for supporting Israel's policies in the occupied [[West Bank]].&lt;ref&gt;Eugene Bird, [http://www.wrmea.org/wrmea-archives/237-washington-report-archives-2000-2005/march-2002/4068-witnessing-a-war-for-peace-in-afghanistan-and-a-war-for-conquest-in-palestine.html "Witnessing a War for Peace in Afghanistan And a War for Conquest in Palestine"], ''[[Washington Report on Middle East Affairs]]'', March 2002, page 18.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003 CNI called for the Senate to reject [[Daniel Pipes]] as a trustee of the [[United States Institute of Peace]], charging he had "gone out of his way to say insulting things to Arabs, Palestinians, Muslim Americans, Black Muslims, Muslims and Islam."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aljazeerah.info/Opinion%20editorials/2003%20Opinion%20Editorials/July/24%20o/Daniel%20Pipes%27%20Nomination,%20By%20the%20Council%20for%20the%20National%20Interest.htm "Daniel Pipes' Nomination"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040927215017/http://aljazeerah.info/Opinion%20editorials/2003%20Opinion%20Editorials/July/24%20o/Daniel%20Pipes'%20Nomination,%20By%20the%20Council%20for%20the%20National%20Interest.htm |date=2004-09-27 }}, editorial by Council for the National Interest, [[Al Jazeera]]. July 24, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004 it opined on the probable transfer of power from [[Yasser Arafat]] to his successor.&lt;ref&gt;Claude Salhani, "Analysis: Preparing the post-Arafat era", [[United Press International]], November 4, 2004: Quote: "According to the Council for the National Interest, Palestinian Authority law states that the speaker of the Palestinian Legislative Council, Rawhi Fattouh, would step in to serve as interim president for 60 days, until elections are held. However, 60 days without leadership in the Palestinian territories would create a dangerous void. The PLO, reports CNI, could overrule this law and appoint Mahmoud Abbas in accordance with a rumored letter written by Arafat to Abbas, naming him as the successor."&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005 a representative criticized a [[World Bank]]’s proposed plan to give Palestinians money to enhance check points, noting that if those checkpoints were in the occupied territories it was against international law.&lt;ref&gt;Emad Mekay, [http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P1-105882234.html "World Bank May Fund Israeli Checkpoints"], [[Inter Press Service]], February 24, 2005, via [[Highbeam]].&lt;/ref&gt; After the U.S. Congress gave Israel a vote of confidence during its 2006 bombing of Lebanon, Eugene Bird said, "This is the usual problem with any resolution that talks about Israel—there are a lot of closet naysayer (in Congress), but they don't want to be a target of the lobby of Israel."&lt;ref&gt;Barbara Ferguson, [http://67.213.74.68/node/288177 "American Lawmakers Give Israel Their Vote of Confidence"] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20130410012609/http://67.213.74.68/node/288177 |date=2013-04-10 }}, ''[[Arab News]]'', July 25, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2006 CNI published a piece on the negative effect of [[Christian Zionists]] on U.S. foreign policy,&lt;ref&gt;CNI, [http://www.zmag.org/znet/viewArticle/2875 "Christian Zionism: An Egregious Threat to Middle East Understanding"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091121224212/http://www.zmag.org/znet/viewArticle/2875 |date=2009-11-21 }}, [[Z Communications]], October 28, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; and held a forum on the topic featuring Reverend Bob Edgar of the [[National Council of Churches]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/TheNote/story?id=2604884&amp;page=10 "Item: The Armageddon Vote in 2006: Christian Zionists and the Midterm Elections"], [[ABC News]] calendar, October 25, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2006, after professors [[John Mearsheimer]] and [[Stephen Walt]] produced their controversial paper entitled "[[The Israel Lobby and U.S. Foreign Policy]]", CNI's Paul Findley told [[National Public Radio]] he was pleased about the paper and said "I think I can pose as a foremost expert on the lobby for Israel, because I was the target the last three years I was in Congress."&lt;ref&gt;Deborah Amos, [https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=14154089 "Paper on Israel Lobby Sparks Heated Debate"], [[NPR]], April 21, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
In the first days of the 2008–2009 [[Gaza War (2008–09)|Gaza War]], CNI issued a statement comparing the attacks to the 1960 [[Sharpeville massacre]] where the [[South Africa under apartheid|South African apartheid regime]] killed 69 protesters, leading eventually to sanctions against the regime.&lt;ref&gt;Franklin Lamb, [http://www.counterpunch.org/2008/12/31/mr-mubarak-tear-down-that-wall/ "Accomplice in Cairo: Mr. Mubarak, Tear Down That Wall!"], ''[[CounterPunch]]'', December 31, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Firoz Osman, "Palestine massacre must be stopped", ''[[The Sowetan]]'', January 16, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2009 Paul Findley was quoted by the ''[[Christian Science Monitor]]'' as saying that President Obama's demands Israel stop the [[Israeli settlement|settlements]] had made him a target of the [[Israel lobby in the United States]].&lt;ref&gt;David R. Francis, [http://www.csmonitor.com/Business/2009/0805/economic-scene-sanctions-on-iran-and-israel-could-defuse-middle-east "Economic Scene: Sanctions on Iran and Israel could defuse Middle East"], ''[[The Christian Science Monitor]]'', August 5, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012 director Philip Giraldi wrote a column titled "Why I Dislike Israel", which criticized the U.S.–Israel relationship and alleged that Israeli Prime Minister [[Benjamin Netanyahu]] was "meddling" in the [[United States presidential election, 2012|2012 U.S. presidential race]].&lt;ref name=AJC2013/&gt;

=== Draft legislation ===
In 2004 CNI proposed the "Israel Accountability and Security Act of 2004". It called upon Israel to dismantle all existing settlements outside of the 1967 border, to halt construction of the [[Israeli West Bank barrier]], to end home demolitions in the West Bank and Gaza, and to dismantle its nuclear weapons program and join a Middle East non-proliferation treaty, and to engage in "serious and unconditional" negotiations with the Palestinians, Syria and Lebanon. Noncompliance would result in U.S.-imposed diplomatic, military and economic sanctions. It also commissioned a Zogby poll which found 56 per cent of Americans agreed that Congress should pass such a bill. The bill never became law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Ibrahim |last=Nafie |url=http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/2004/690/op1.htm |title=Talking to Bush |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090723210110/http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/2004/690/op1.htm |archivedate=2009-07-23 |work=[[Al-Ahram]] |date=13–19 May 2004 |issue=690}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=George |last=Bisharat |url=http://www.commondreams.org/views04/1208-26.htm |title=Advance U.S. -- not Israel's -- interests |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130617012437/http://www.commondreams.org/views04/1208-26.htm |archivedate=June 17, 2013 |work=Seattle Post-Intelligencer |date=December 8, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Joint initiatives===

CNI representatives have signed on to joint initiatives, as Eugene Bird did to the 2004 letter by 60 former U.S. diplomats who distributed a letter critical of then-[[United States President]] [[George W. Bush]]'s "endorsement of Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon's unilateral plan to reject the rights of three million Palestinians, to deny the right of refugees to return to their homeland, and to retain five large illegal settlement blocs in the occupied West Bank", reversing 
"long-standing American policy in the Middle East".&lt;ref&gt;Sam Husseini, [http://www.commondreams.org/cgi-bin/newsprint.cgi?file=/news2004/0506-12.htm "Institute for Public Accuracy news wrapup"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110605070246/http://www.commondreams.org/cgi-bin/newsprint.cgi?file=%2Fnews2004%2F0506-12.htm |date=2011-06-05 }}, published at [[Common Dreams]], May 6, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2005 CNI joined other concerned organizations in a meeting with Department of State officials regarding Israeli mistreatment of Palestinian American prisoners and called for the release of some of the prisoners.&lt;ref&gt;[http://electronicintifada.net/v2/article3621.shtml State Department to be Questioned on Silence regarding American Detainees in Israel], Press Release, Council for the National Interest, February 16, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2005 CNI joined with more than a dozen groups to protest the annual [[American Israel Public Affairs Committee]] ("AIPAC") convention.&lt;ref&gt;[http://electronicintifada.net/v2/article3865.shtml "Three Speakers Set for Protest Against Aipac's Promotion of Occupation of Palestine and War Against Iran"], CNI press release, May 21, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2006 CNI co-sponsored a protest of over 400 people at the Israeli Embassy during the [[2006 Lebanon War]] between Israel and Hezbollah.&lt;ref&gt;William Hughes, [http://baltimorechronicle.com/2006/072806HUGHES.shtml "Demonstrators in DC Charge Israel with Barbarism in Lebanon/Gaza"], ''[[Baltimore Chronicle]]'', July 28, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007 CNI joined 30 other groups calling for the U.S. government to obtain detailed site information on Israel's cluster bomb strikes in Lebanon during its 2006 attacks on that nation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/atfl-thirty-one-groups-call-for-israel-to-release-cluster-bomb-data-58058242.html Thirty-one Groups Call for Israel to Release Cluster Bomb Data], [http://www.atfl.org American Task Force for Lebanon], June 15, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012 the Council's director Alison Weir participated in a panel on AIPAC during the "Occupy AIPAC" conference in Washington, D.C., that was organized by a number of antiwar and pro-Palestinian groups.&lt;ref&gt;Dale Sprusansky, [http://www.wrmea.org/archives/507-washington-report-archives-2011-2015/may-2012/11182-waging-peace-occupy-aipac-provides-counter-narrative.html "Occupy AIPAC" Provides Counter-Narrative], [[Washington Report on Middle East Affairs]], May 2012, pg. 73-74.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://blog.adl.org/tags/council-for-the-national-interest 'Occupy AIPAC' Conference Seeks to Lambast Pro-Israel Lobby and Cast Antiwar Agenda as the '99%'], [[Anti-Defamation League]], March 2, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Polls===

CNI has commissioned several polls. A 2003 a [[Zogby International]] poll showed that while 56 percent of Americans strongly support or somewhat support a Palestinian state, 30 percent somewhat or strongly oppose a Palestinian state. Fourteen percent were not sure.&lt;ref&gt;Richard H.

===Conferences and hearings===
In April 2002 CNI's Foundation sponsored a four-day conference titled "Rescue U.S. Middle East Policy and Challenge the Lobby" meant to draw attention to what it believed was the [[George W. Bush administration]]'s lop-sided pro-Israeli policies. Speakers included former members of the United States Congress, representatives of Palestinian and Arab groups who recently had witnessed Israeli demolition of [[West Bank]] refugee camps during "[[Operation Defensive Shield]]", and members of the media who discussed the media's role in foreign policy. Conference attendees also spent a full day lobbying members of congress.&lt;ref&gt;Terry Waltz,  [http://www.wrmea.org/wrmea-archives/240-washington-report-archives-2000-2005/june-july-2002/4169-activisms.html CNIF Conference Aims to Rescue U.S. Foreign Policy], ''[[Washington Report on Middle East Affairs]]'', 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

CNI conducts public hearings on [[Capitol Hill]]. Noteworthy events included a June 2004 event CNI co-sponsored with the [[Council on American-Islamic Relations]], a presentation on "The Muslim Vote in 2004" where independent presidential candidate [[Ralph Nader]] complained that "Muslim Americans are only the latest religious and ethnic group to feel the brunt of political hysteria and abuse" and commented about Israeli leaders "The days when the chief Israeli puppeteer comes to the United States and meets with the puppet in the White House and then proceeds to Capitol Hill, where he meets with hundreds of other puppets, should be replaced." This led to a heated debate with the [[Anti-Defamation League]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/64970 "Nader Lets Loose With Anti-Israel Tirade"], [[Arutz Sheva]], July 1, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wolf Blitzer, [http://www.cnn.com/2004/US/06/29/numbers.small/index.html "Numbers may be small, but impact could be huge"], [[CNN]], June 29, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Brian Faler, [https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A58007-2004Aug11.html "Nader vs. the ADL"], ''[[The Washington Post]]'', August 12, 2004; Page A07.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ralph Nader, [http://www.counterpunch.org/nader10162004.html "Ralph Nader's letter to Abraham Foxman: Criticizing Israel is Not Anti-Semitism"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090707020003/http://www.counterpunch.org/nader10162004.html |date=2009-07-07 }}, ''[[CounterPunch]]'', October 16, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

His spokesperson told reporters Haniyya wanted direct relations with the United States and the international community and said that "Hamas is not against the efforts aiming to establish of a Palestinian state on the pre-1967 borderlines with Jerusalem as its capital". Then CNI Vice-Chair Ambassador David Newton said the group intended to "convey the reality of the humanitarian situation to the US Congress."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-227234696.html "Hamas' Haniyya makes overtures to US Administration"], [[Kuwait News Agency]], May 22, 2010, via [[Highbeam]].&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Honest Reporting Canada#Honest Reporting Canada|Honest Reporting Canada]], a pro-Israel NGO objected to Eugene Bird's comments and wrote complaints to the CBC.

'''Dalibor Brozović''' ({{IPA-sh|dǎlibor brǒːzoʋit͡ɕ|hr}}; 28 July 1927, in [[Sarajevo]] &amp;ndash; 19 June 2009, in [[Zagreb]]) was a [[Croatia]]n [[linguistics|linguist]], [[Slavic studies|Slavist]], [[dialectology|dialectologist]] and politician. He studied the history of standard [[Slavic languages]], especially [[Croatian language|Croatian]]. He was an active [[Esperantist]] since 1946, and wrote Esperanto poetry as well as translated works into the language.&lt;ref&gt;Pleadin, Josip (2002). "Biografia leksikono de kroatiaj esperantistoj" (in Esperanto). Đurđevac: Grafokom.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life and career==

He was born in [[Sarajevo]] and went to primary school in [[Zenica]]. Then he went to comprehensive secondary schools in [[Visoko, Bosnia and Herzegovina|Visoko]], Sarajevo and [[Zagreb]]. He received a BA degree in the [[Croatian language]] and [[Yugoslavia|Yugoslav]] literatures at the [[Faculty of Humanities and Social Sciences, University of Zagreb]]. In 1957, he received his Ph.D. with the thesis ''Speech in the [[Fojnica]] Valley''.

Brozović worked as an assistant at the Zagreb Theater Academy (1952–1953) and as a lecturer at the [[University of Ljubljana]] (until 1956). He subsequently went to the Faculty of Philosophy in Zadar, becoming an associate professor (1956), [[docent]] (1958), extraordinary (1962) and full (1968-1990) professor. In 1969 he worked as a visiting professor at the [[University of Michigan]], and since 1971 at the [[University of Regensburg]].

In 1975 he became an associate, and in 1977 extraordinary, and in 1986 full member of the [[Yugoslav Academy of Sciences and Arts]]. Since 1986 he was an external member of the [[Macedonian Academy of Sciences and Arts]], and since 1991 of the [[Academia Europaea]].

Since 1946 he was a member of the [[KPJ|Communist Party]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last=Bilosnić |first=Tomislav Marijan |date=13 March 2012 |title=Dr. Ante Franić: Dalekometni ciljevi Deklaracije |trans-title=Dr. Ante Franić: Long-range goals of the Declaration |url=https://archive.org/details/Deklaracija_Ante_Franic_Zadarski_List |publisher=''[[Zadarski list]]'' |page=16 |location=Zadar |issn=1333-316X |accessdate=13 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the late 1980s, he was a co-founder and vice-president of the [[Croatian Democratic Union]], which would win the [[Croatian parliamentary election, 1990|1990 elections]]. He was the vice-president of the presidency of the Republic of [[Croatia]] (in 1990) and a member of the [[Croatian Parliament]] (1992-1995). In the period 1991-2001 he headed the [[Miroslav Krleža Lexicographical Institute]]. He edited the ''Atlas of European and Slavic Dialectology''.

==Linguistic importance==
Brozović has been described as one of the most influential Croatian linguists of the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vecernji.hr/biografije/dalibor-brozovic-127 |title=Dalibor Brozović |publisher=''[[Večernji list]]'' |date= |accessdate=January 2, 2014 |language=Serbo-Croatian |location=Zagreb |issn=0350-5006}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this view is given from an extremely nationalist perspective, as Brozović was known to often abandon linguistics for an extremely nationalist discourse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Kordić, Snježana |authorlink=Snježana Kordić |title=Demagogija umjesto znanosti (odgovor Daliboru Brozoviću) |trans-title=Demagogy instead of science (response to Dalibor Brozović) |url=http://bib.irb.hr/datoteka/430252.DEMAGOGIJA_UMJESTO_ZNANOSTI.PDF |language=Serbo-Croatian |journal=Književna republika |location=Zagreb |volume=1 |issue=7–8 |pages=176–202 |year=2003 |issn=1334-1057 |id={{ZDB|2122129-7}} |archivedate=23 August 2012 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6A7zQNqNr?url=http://bib.irb.hr/datoteka/430252.DEMAGOGIJA_UMJESTO_ZNANOSTI.PDF |accessdate=17 March 2014 |df= |deadurl=yes }} [http://opak.crolib.hr/cgi-bin/unicat.cgi?form=D1440910057 (CROLIB)].&lt;/ref&gt;{{Sfn | Kordić | 2007 | pp = 184–195}} Among his main works are the book ''Standardni jezik'' ("Standard Language") (1970) and the article "Hrvatski jezik, njegovo mjesto unutar južnoslavenskih i drugih slavenskih jezika, njegove povijesne mijene kao jezika hrvatske književnosti" ("Croatian Language, Its Place among the South Slav and Other Slav Languages, Its Historical Changes as the Language of Croatian Literature") (1978). The former gives a typology of [[standard language]]s, which however meets criticism for containing disputable and vague criteria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Tolstoj |first=Nikita Iljič | authorlink= |editor1-last=Guchman |editor1-first=M.

Whereas it was widely believed that Croatian was only standardized around the time of the [[Illyrian movement]] and [[Ljudevit Gaj]], Brozović argued that the standardization began around 1600 and greatly developed around 1750. However, this Brozović’s article also faces criticism due to the fact that "in the 18th century, there was no standard language ([[Dachsprache|’überdachende’]] sprachliche Entität), which would roof [[Kajkavian dialect|Kajkavian]] and [[Shtokavian dialect|Shtokavian]]".&lt;ref&gt;"da es eine das Kajkavische und Štokavische ’überdachende’ sprachliche Entität im 18. Jh. nicht gegeben hat" ({{Harvnb | Gröschel | 2009 | p = 90}})&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, the major standardization activities took place only in the 19th century.{{Sfn | Gröschel | 2009 | pp = 8–12}}

Brozović was one of the authors of the [[Declaration on the Status and Name of the Croatian Standard Language]], an influential programmatic statement against Yugoslavian linguistic [[Serbo-Croatian#History|unitarianism]] from a Croatian nationalist perspective.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= |last= |title=SOS ili tek alibi za nasilje nad jezikom |trans-title=SOS or nothing but an alibi for violence against language |url=http://bib.irb.hr/datoteka/578565.O_Deklaraciji_Forum.jpg |language=Serbo-Croatian |location=Zagreb |publisher=''Forum'' |date=16 March 2012 |pages=38–39 |issn=1848-204X |archivedate=7 July 2012 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/68yT7x9My?url=http://bib.irb.hr/datoteka/578565.O_Deklaraciji_Forum.jpg |accessdate=9 August 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Two years before Declaration, Brozović denied the existence of Yugoslavian linguistic unitarism: "for Croato-Serbian language as language, as linguistic phenomenon, as language in the Slavic family, there has been no need to unify: it has always been a unity".&lt;ref&gt;"hrvatskosrpski jezik kao jezik, kao lingvistički fenomen, kao jedan od jezika slavenske porodice, nije ni trebalo izjednačivati: on je oduvijek bio jedan" ({{Harvnb | Brozović | 1965 | p = 38}})&lt;/ref&gt; Retrospectively, west European scientists judge the Yugoslav language policy as an exemplary one.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Busch |editor1-first=Brigitta |editor2-last=Kelly-Holmes |editor2-first=Helen |title=Language, Discourse and Borders in the Yugoslav Successor States |publisher=Multilingual Matters |pages=51, 54, 59 |location=Clevedon |year=2004 |isbn= |oclc=803615012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Mappes-Niediek |first=Norbert | authorlink= |year=2005 |language=German |title=Die Ethno-Falle: der Balkan-Konflikt und was Europa daraus lernen kann |trans-title=The Ethnic Trap: the Balkan conflict and what Europe can learn from it |location=Berlin |publisher=Christoph Links Verlag |pages=18, 64 |isbn=978-3-86153-367-2 |oclc=61665869}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Sfn | Gröschel | 2009 | p = 72}} It turned out that the Deklaracija was the work of the [[State Security Administration|secret police of Yugoslavia (UDBA)]] and that Brozović was a member of the UDBA under the pseudonym "Forum".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Ivančić |first=Viktor |authorlink=Viktor Ivančić |date=11 July 2015 |title=Udio Udbe |trans-title=Contribution of the UDBA |url=http://www.portalnovosti.com/udio-udbe |language=Serbo-Croatian |publisher=''[[Novosti (Croatia)|Novosti]]'' |location=Zagreb |issn=1845-8955 |archivedate=13 July 2015 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6ZzZYY6Sl?url=http://www.portalnovosti.com/udio-udbe |accessdate=8 August 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Mamić |first=Tomislav |url=http://www.jutarnji.hr/na-pripremi-deklaracije-o-hrvatskom-jeziku-radili-su-i-dugogodisnji-agenti-udb--e/1377401/ |title=Manolić otkriva u memoarima: na pripremi Deklaracije o hrvatskom jeziku radili su i dugogodišnji agenti Udbe!

However, Brozović advocated the term "Croato-Serbian" even in 1988.{{Sfn | Brozović | 1988 | p = 4}} As far as language status is concerned, Brozović has asserted for nearly three decades that "the Serbian and Croatian variants are (...) phenomenons, which are analogous to the English and American variants";&lt;ref&gt;"srpska i hrvatska varijanta predstavljaju [...] fenomene analogne engleskoj i američkoj varijanti" ({{Harvnb | Brozović | 1965 | pp = 35–36}})&lt;/ref&gt; "As in other cases where several nations use one standard language (German, Dutch, English, French, Spanish, Portuguese standard language), the standard Croato-Serbian language is not unified. In linguistics (especially in sociolinguistics), the realizations of such standard languages are called ''variants of a standard language''".&lt;ref&gt;"Kao i u drugim slučajevima kada se jednim standardnim jezikom služi više nacija (njemački, nizozemski, engleski, francuski, španjolski, portugalski standandardni jezik), standardni hrvatskosrpski jezik nije jedinstven. Realizacijski oblici takvih standardnih jezika nazivaju se u lingvistici (prvenstveno u sociolingvistici) ''varijantama standardnog jezika''" ({{Harvnb | Brozović | 1988 | p = 102}})&lt;/ref&gt; Brozović maintained that it is "a fact that Serbs and Croats have a common language",&lt;ref&gt;"činjenica da Srbi i Hrvati imaju zajednički jezik" ({{Harvnb | Brozović | 1965 | p = 41}})&lt;/ref&gt; and he described it as [[Pluricentric language#Serbo-Croatian|pluricentric]] even in 1992.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Brozović |first=Dalibor |editor1-last=Clyne |editor1-first=Michael G |editor1link=Michael Clyne |title=Pluricentric Languages: Differing Norms in Different Nations |publisher=Mouton de Gruyter |pages=347–380 |chapter=Serbo-Croatian as a pluricentric language |series=Contributions to the sociology of language 62 |location=Berlin &amp; New York |year=1992 |isbn=3-11-012855-1 |oclc=24668375 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1990s, Brozović became one of the leading proponents of [[linguistic purism]] in Croatia.{{Sfn | Kordić | 2007 | pp = 184–195}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Czerwiński |first=Maciej |year=2005 |title=Język – ideologia – naród: polityka językowa w Chorwacji a język mediów |trans-title=Language – ideology – nation: Language policy in Croatia and the language of media |language=Polish |location=Kraków |publisher=Scriptum |page=131 |isbn=8360163049 |oclc=64586273}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Brozović states that the list of 100 words of the basic [[Croatian language|Croatian]], [[Serbian language|Serbian]], [[Bosnian language|Bosnian]], and [[Montenegrin language|Montenegrin]] vocabulary, as set out by [[Morris Swadesh]], shows that all 100 words are identical.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Brozović, Dalibor |title=Europske integracije i hrvatski jezik |trans-title=European integrations and the Croatian language |journal=[[Jezik]] |volume=49 |issue=4 |page=124 |year=2002 |language=Serbo-Croatian |issn=0021-6925}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Swadesh, at least twenty words must differ if they are to be considered as different languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Kloss |first=Heinz | authorlink=Heinz Kloss |editor1-last=Göschel |editor1-first=Joachim |editor2-last=Nail |editor2-first=Norbert |editor3-last=van der Els |editor3-first=Gaston |title=Zur Theorie des Dialekts: Aufsätze aus 100 Jahren Forschung |publisher=F.

Brozović received the Zadar City Award for a prominent scientific activity (for the book ''Standardni jezik'') in the 1970, and an Award for Life's Work of the Republic of Croatia in 1992.

The '''Dhaneswar Khera Buddha image inscription''' is an epigraphic record on the base of a bronze image of the [[Buddha]] recording its dedication by the wife of Harirāja of the [[Gupta Empire|Gupta]] lineage. The inscription provides an important documentation on the local Gupta dynasty and has been dated to the early 5th Century AD.

==Discovery==
''Dhaneswar Khera'' (sometimes also referred to as Danesar Khera) is located near the village of Icchāwar or Nicchāwar in Jaspura Tahsil, [[Banda District]], [[Uttar Pradesh]], India. The bronze statue was discovered in the nineteenth century with two others and published by William Hooey and [[Vincent Arthur Smith]] in 1895. Since 1969 it has been kept in the [[British Museum]] where it is displayed in the Asian Gallery.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/highlights/highlight_objects/asia/b/bronze_figure_of_the_seated_bu.aspx British Museum Highlights]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; The other two statues from the hoard are in the [[Bangkok National Museum]] and the [[Nelson Atkins Museum of Art]] in Kansas City.&lt;ref&gt;Sheila E. Hoey Middleton, "The Third Buddha," ''South Asian Studies'' 18.1 (2002): pp. 67-72.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nelson-atkins.org/art/CollectionDatabase_ImageView.cfm?id=27864&amp;theme=SseAsia Nelson Atkins Collection]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Inscription==
The inscription is written in [[Sanskrit]] on the pedestal of the sculpture. It was first noted in 1949 and subsequently published by [[Dineschandra Sircar|D. C. Sircar]] in ''[[Epigraphia Indica]]''.&lt;ref&gt;''JOR'' 28 (1949): p. 185ff; D. C. Sircar, "Copper Coin of Harigupta", ''Epigraphia Indica'' 33 (1959-60): p. 97&lt;/ref&gt; The record was later discussed by P. L. Gupta.&lt;ref&gt;P. L. Gupta, ''Imperial Guptas'', p. 196.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Translation ==
A literal translation of the text is below:

1) deya-dharmmo=ya[ṃ*] Gupta=vaṅśo [read: vaṃś]-odita-śrī-Harirājasya ra [read: rā]jñī-mahādevyā[ḥ] [|*] yad=attra puṇya[ṃ*] tad=bhavatu

2) sa[rvva]-sa[TV(ttvā)nā][ṃ*] māta(tā)-pitṛ-pū[rvva]ṅgama(me)na anuttara-pada-jñāna (n-ā)vāptaye [||*]

The inscription records that the statue of the Buddha was the meritorious gift (''deyadharma'') of Mahādevī, the queen of Harirāja. The ruler Hariāja is described as being ‘born in the Gupta lineage’ who is also recorded on a copper-plate charter from [[Vārānasī]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/collection_object_details.aspx?objectId=223694&amp;partId=1 British Museum Collection]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''Friedrich Wilken''' (23 May 1777 in [[Ratzeburg]] – 24 December 1840 in [[Berlin]]) was a German [[historian]] ([[Oriental studies|orientalist]]), professor and [[librarian]].

He was born 23 May 777, at Ratzeburg, in the [[Saxe-Lauenburg|duchy of Lauenburg]]. He studied at [[Göttingen|Gottingen]], at first theology, but afterwards, classic and Oriental philology and history. In 1798 he received the prize for an essay, ''De Bellorum Cruciatorum ex Abulfeda Historia;'' in 1805 he was appointed professor of history at [[Heidelberg]], and in 1807 director of the university library. In 1817 he was called to [[Berlin]] as first librarian and professor in the university, and in 1819 he was made a member of the Academy of Sciences. He undertook a literary journey to Italy in 1826; in 1829 he went in behalf of the government to France and England, and in 1838 to [[Wiesbaden]] and [[Munich]]. He died on 24 December 1840. His main work is the ''Gesch. der Kreuzzuge nach morgenlandischen und abendlandischehn Berichten'' (Leips. 1807-32, 7 volumes). He also wrote, ''Gesch. der Bildung, Beraubung und Vernichtunag der alten Heidelberger Buchersammlung'' ( Heidelb. 1817): — ''Gesch. der koniglichen Bibliothek zu Berlin'' (Berlin, 1828). (B.P.)

      <comment>Further explained definition of what gender history does</comment>
      <model>wikitext</model>
      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10909">'''Gender history''' is a sub-field of [[history]] and [[gender studies]], which looks at the past from the perspective of [[gender]]. It is in many ways, an outgrowth of [[women's history]]. The discipline considers in what ways historical events and periodization impact women differently from men. For instance, in an influential article in 1977, "Did Women have a Renaissance?", [[Joan Kelly]] questioned whether the notion of a Renaissance was relevant to women.&lt;ref name = "kelly"&gt;"Did Women have a Renaissance?" ''Becoming Visible: Women in European History''. Houghton Mifflin, 1977.&lt;/ref&gt; 
Gender historians are also interested in how gender difference has been perceived and configured at different times and places, usually with the assumption that such differences are socially constructed. These social constructions of gender throughout time are also represented as changes in the expected norms of behavior for those labeled male or female. Those who study gender history note these changes in norms and those performing them over time and interpret what those changes say about the larger social/cultural/political climate. 

==Impact==
Despite its relatively short life, gender history (and its forerunner women's history) has had a rather significant effect on the general study of [[history]]. Since the 1960s, when the initially small field first achieved a measure of acceptance, it has gone through a number of different phases, each with its own challenges and outcomes, but always making an impact of some kind on the historical discipline. Although some of the changes to the study of history have been quite obvious, such as increased numbers of books on famous women or simply the admission of greater numbers of women into the historical profession, other influences are more subtle, even though they may be more politically groundbreaking in the end. By 1970, gender historians turned to documenting ordinary women's expectations, aspirations and status. In the 80s with the rise of the feminist movement, the focus shifted to uncovering women' oppression and discrimination. Nowadays, gender history is more about charting female agency and recognizing female achievements in several fields that were usually dominated by men.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.history.ac.uk/ihr/Focus/Gender/articles.html|title=History in Focus: articles on gender history|website=www.history.ac.uk|access-date=2017-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Within the profession===
According to historian [[Joan Wallach Scott|Joan Scott]], conflict occurred between Women's History [[List of historians|historians]] and other historians in a number of ways.&lt;ref name = "scott"&gt;"Gender: A Useful Category of Historical Analysis," [[American Historical Review]]
91, No. 5 (December 1986).&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[American Historical Association]], when [[feminism|feminists]] argued that female historians were treated unequally within the field and underrepresented in the association, they were essentially leveling charges of historical negligence by traditional historians. Notions of [[professional]]ism were not rejected outright, but they were accused of being biased.

===Supplementary history===
According to Scott, the construction of Women's History as "supplementary" to the rest of history had a similar effect. At first glance, a supplement simply adds information which has been missing from the greater story, but as Scott points out, it also questions why the information was left out in the first place. Whenever it is noticed that a woman found to be missing from [[recorded history|written history]], Women's History first describes her role, second, examines which mechanisms allowed her role to be omitted, and third, asks to what other information these mechanisms were blind.

===Gender theory===
Finally, the advent of [[gender studies|gender theory]] once again challenged commonly held ideas of the discipline, including those scholars studying Women's History. [[Postmodernism|Post-modern]] criticism of essentialising [[social construction|socially constructed]] groups, be they [[gender]] groups or otherwise, pointed out the weaknesses in various sorts of history. In the past, [[historian]]s have attempted to describe the shared experience of large numbers of people, as though these people and their experiences were homogeneous and uniform. Women have multiple identities, influenced by any number of factors including [[Race (classification of human beings)|race]] and [[Social class|class]], and any examination of history which conflates their experiences, fails to provide an accurate picture.

==History of Masculinity==
The history of masculinity emerged as a specialty in the 1990s, evidenced by numerous studies of men in groups, and how concepts of masculinity shape their values and behavior. Gail Bederman identified two approaches: one that emerged from women's history and one that ignored it:
:Two types of ‘men’s history’ are being written these days. One builds on twenty years of women’s history scholarship, analyzing masculinity as part of larger gender and cultural processes. The other . . . looks to the past to see how men in early generations understood (and misunderstood) themselves as men. Books of the second type mostly ignore women’s history findings and methodology.&lt;ref&gt;Gail Bederman, ''Journal of American History'' 84 (1997) p. 680&lt;/ref&gt;

== Gender in religion ==
All over the world, religion is formed around a divine, supernatural figure. While the idea of the divine, supernatural figure varies from religion to religion, each one is framed around different concepts of what it means to be male and female. Furthermore, the religion of a culture usually directly corresponds or is influenced by the culture's gender structure, like the family structures and/or the state. Therefore the religious structure and the gender structure work together to form and define a culture, creating the defining structures of equality and uniformity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Gender in History: Global Perspectives|last=Wiesner-Hanks|first=Merry E|publisher=Blackwell Publishing|year=2011|isbn=978-1-4051-8995-8|location=Malden, MA|pages=109,110}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7476">'''Harmonic Grammar''' is a linguistic model proposed by [[Geraldine Legendre]], [[Yoshiro Miyata]], and [[Paul Smolensky]] in 1990. It is a [[connectionism|connectionist]] approach to modeling linguistic well-formedness. More recently, Harmonic Grammar has been used to refer more generally to models of language that use weighted constraints, including ones that are not explicitly connectionist – see e.g. Pater (2009) and Potts et al. (2010).

'''Heinrich Robert Zimmer''' (6 December 1890 – 20 March 1943) was a German [[Indologist]] and historian of [[South Asia]]n art, most known for his works, ''Myths and Symbols in Indian Art and Civilization'' and ''Philosophies of India''. He was the most important German scholar in Indian [[Philology]] after [[Max Müller]] (1823-1900).&lt;ref name=hdl/&gt; In 2010, a "Heinrich Zimmer Chair for Indian Philosophy and Intellectual History" was inaugurated at [[Heidelberg University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asia-europe.uni-heidelberg.de/en/news-events/news/detail/m/indian-ambassador-inaugurates-the-chair-for-philosophy-and-intellectual-history-1.html |title=India's Ambassador inaugurates Heinrich Zimmer Chair |date=Jun 25, 2010 |publisher=[[Heidelberg University]] website |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100629025053/http://www.asia-europe.uni-heidelberg.de/en/news-events/news/detail/m/indian-ambassador-inaugurates-the-chair-for-philosophy-and-intellectual-history-1.html |archivedate=2010-06-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and education==
He was born in [[Greifswald]], Germany. Zimmer began studying [[Sanskrit]] and [[linguistics]] at the [[University of Berlin]] in 1909. He earned his doctorate in 1914 with a thesis entitled ''Studien zur Geschichte der [[Gotra]]s'' and directed by [[Heinrich Lüders]].

==Career==
Between 1920-24 he lectured at the [[University of Greifswald]], moving to [[Ruprecht Karl University of Heidelberg|Heidelberg University]] to fill the Chair of Indian [[Philology]] (1924-1938).&lt;ref name=hdl&gt;[http://www.sai.uni-heidelberg.de/en/zimmer-chair/ Heinrich Zimmer Chair for Philosophy and Intellectual History] [[Heidelberg University]].&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1938 he was dismissed by the [[Nazism|Nazis]], and he emigrated to [[England]] where between 1939-40 he taught at [[Balliol College]], [[Oxford]]. In 1940 he moved to [[New Rochelle, New York|New Rochelle]], [[New York (state)|New York]] where he eventually accepted a Visiting Lecturer position in [[Philosophy]] at [[Columbia University]]. Here, [[Joseph Campbell]], who was then working on his first book, ''A Skeleton Key to Finnegans Wake'' (1944) attended his lectures.  The two men became good friends.

Zimmer died unexpectedly of pneumonia in 1943, two years after his arrival in the United States.  According to Joseph Campbell, "Zimmer was at the opening of what would have been the most productive period of his career. . . hardly had he begun to find his stride, however, when, suddenly stricken, he passed from full career to his death within seven days." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Zimmer|first1=Heinrich|editor1-last=Campbell|editor1-first=Joseph|title=Myths and Symbols in Indian Art and Civilization|date=1973|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=USA|isbn=9788120807518|page=v Editor's Foreword}}&lt;/ref&gt; After Zimmer's  death, Campbell was given the task of editing and posthumously publishing Zimmer's papers, which he did over the next 12 years, turning Zimmer’s lecture notes into four books, in the Bollingen Series: ''Myths and Symbols in Indian Art and Civilization'', ''Philosophies of India'', ''The Art of Indian Asia'', and ''The King and the Corpse'', which in turn became Zimmer's lasting legacy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/1488076/Heinrich-Zimmer|title=Heinrich Zimmer|publisher=Britannica.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Work==
Zimmer's method was to examine religious images using their sacred significance as a key to their psychic transformation. His use of ([[India]]n) philosophy and religious history to interpret art was at odds with traditional scholarship. His vast knowledge of [[Hindu mythology]] and philosophy (particularly [[Puranic]] and [[Tantra|Tantric]] works) gave him insights into the art, insights that were appreciated by [[Joseph Campbell]] among others. Campbell edited many of Zimmer's writings after his death. In the foreword to Zimmer’s book, ''Artistic Form and Yoga in the Sacred Images of India,'' Campbell makes reference to a memorial to Heinrich Zimmer, which was read at the New York Oriental Club meeting in the spring of 1949: “Dr. Zimmer stood alone, forming a class by himself, not only for the wide range of subjects he was proficient in, but also for his unique genius of interpretation. . . Zimmer strove to understand both Eastern and Western ideas from Universal conceptions lying at the root of spiritual and psychological developments everywhere." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Zimmer|first1=Heinrich|title=Artistic form and yoga in the sacred images of India|date=1990|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=new Jersey|isbn=0691072892|page=foreword|edition=First Princeton paperback printing}}&lt;/ref&gt; The psychiatrist [[Carl Jung]] also developed a long-standing relationship with Zimmer, and incidentally edited a volume of Zimmer's entitled Der Weg zum Selbst (''The Way to the Self''). The two men first met in 1932, after which Zimmer, along with [[Richard Wilhelm (sinologist)|Richard Wilhelm]], became one of the few male friends of Jung.

Zimmer is credited by many for the popularizing of [[South Asia]]n art in the West, as he was the first to identify the radical difference between Western classical and [[Indian art]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://press.princeton.edu/catalogs/series/bshz.html |title=Works by Heinrich Zimmer, Completed and Edited by Joseph Campbell |publisher=Princeton University Press |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100720182616/http://press.princeton.edu/catalogs/series/bshz.html |archivedate=2010-07-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
In 1929 he married Christiane, daughter of Austrian novelist [[Hugo von Hofmannsthal]]. Zimmer died of pneumonia in New Rochelle, New York, on March 20, 1943.

==Quotes==
&lt;blockquote&gt;On all levels there are rituals capable of transforming man.  But it is everywhere the tradition and trend to rank the spiritual, sublime practices above the sensual and magical ones, since the general course of cultural development has favored the spiritual element over the material and feminine.  This development has taken place under the predominance of the male principle.  But with the cult of the Great Goddess in late Hinduism, the archaic heritage of sensual earth-bound rites rises once again overwhelmingly to the zenith."&lt;ref&gt;Zimmer, Heinrich.

==History==

===Establishment===
{{Main|Nathuram Premi}}
[[Image:Premijifestschrift.jpg|thumb|left|Nathuram Premi, founder of Hindi Granth Karyalay]]
On 24 September 1912, Pandit [[Nathuram Premi]] founded the publishing house ''Hindi Granth Ratnākar Kāryālay'' (now known as ''Hindi Granth Karyalay'') at C.P. Tank, Mumbai. It was to become the foremost Hindi publishing house in India and is also the oldest bookstore of [[Mumbai]]. 
Born on 26 November 1881 in Deori, in the district of [[Sagar District|Sagar]] in [[Bundelkhand]], [[Madhya Pradesh]], Nāthūrām Premī was the eldest child of Tundelal Modi, a travelling merchant of modest means, belonging to the [[Parwar (Jain)|Paravāra]] community of [[Digambara]] Jains hailing from [[Bundelkhand]]. He arrived in Mumbai in 1901, and started working for the [[Digambara Jain Tīrthakṣetra Committee]] as a clerk. The owner of Hirabaug, Seth Manikchandra, impressed by his honesty, diligence and intellect asked the young Nāthūrām Premī to take up rooms at the Hirabaug Dharmashala at the heart of the [[Mumbai]] market and start his business from there. He accepted the offer and together with Pannalal Bakhliwal started the ''Jain Granth Ratnākar Kāryālay'' in 1906. From this humble beginnings, in 1912 he started the publishing house ''Hindi Granth Ratnākar Kāryālay.''

===Early history===
The first publication of Hindi Granth Ratnākar Kāryālay was a Hindi translation of John Stuart Mill's ''Liberty'', titled ''Svādhīnatā'' translated by Pandit Mahaviraprasad Dvivedi. They published almost the entire oeuvre of [[Sharat Chandra Chatterji]], the great Bengali writer and some works of [[Rabindranath Tagore]], such as ''Ānkh kī Kirkirī'', and ''Naukā Dūbī''. Premiji also published Hindi translations of the Gujarati writer KM Munshi, such as ''Gujarāt ke Nāth'' and ''Pātan kā Prabhutva''. Other famous works published include [[Munshi Premchand]]'s classic novel, ''Godān'' and short story collections titled ''Nava Nidhi'' and ''Sapta Saroj''. He also published works of then new writers such as Hajariprasad Dvivedi, Jainendrakumar, Yashpal, Acharya Chatursen, and Pandit Sudarshan. He also published the Bengali plays of Dvijendra Lal Rai for the first time in Hindi.

In memory of Seth Manikchandra, Premiji established the ''Manikacandra Jain Granthamālā'' wherein he published Jain scriptures, for the first time systematically edited by philologists. The ''Manikacandra Jain Granthamālā'' published over 48 [[Digambara]] Jain texts, mostly written in [[Prakrit]], [[Apabhramsa|Apabhramśa]] or [[Sanskrit]]. He ran the Manikacandra Jain Granthamālā on an honorary basis between 1915 and the 1950s selling all the books at cost price. When his health began to fail, it was decided to hand over the series to ''Bhāratīya Jñānapītha'' in [[Varanasi]].

===Current management ===

Under Premiji’s tutelage, Hindi Granth Ratnākar Kāryālay became India's No. 1 publishers of Hindi literature. In recognition of his contributions to Indian literature, the acclaimed Hindi novelist Vishnu Prabhakar called Premiji the ''"Bhīsma Pitāmaha"'' of Hindi publishing.
Premiji had suffered from asthma for a long time and died owing to old age on 30 January 1960. He left behind his daughter-in-law and two grandsons. His elder grandson, Yashodhar Modi, continued his legacy till his death in 2013, along with his son, Manish Modi. Now Hindi Granth Karyalay is being managed by Premiji's great grandson Manish Modi. In Premiji's memory, his grandson Yashodhar Modi has started the '''Pandit Nathuram Premi Research Series'''. This series has published select volumes focusing on subjects as varied as Jainism, philosophy and yoga and published original texts by ancient and medieval Jain ascetics such as ''[[Kundakunda]], Samantabhadra, [[Pujyapada|Pūjyapāda]], Joindu, Prabhācandra, Vādirāja, Bhāvadeva ''and many others, usually accompanied by translation in either Hindi or English. 
Also, highly respected modern scholars such as Premiji himself, Prof. Ludwig Alsdorf, [[Maurice Bloomfield|Prof. Maurice Bloomfield]], Prof. Willem Bollée and Dr. [[Jaykumar Jalaj]] have been and are being published in the Pandit Nathuram Premi Research Series.

==Bookstore==
Hindi Granth Karyalay's bookstore is located at 9 Hirabaug, C. P. Tank, Mumbai 400004. Besides housing its own published titles, Hindi Granth Karyalay also stocks, sells and distribute Indological literature of thousands of different titles.

Despite the fact that the present day channel through which Sahibi River meanders is mostly arid with seasonal rainfalls, this river and its tributaries were the site of the flourishing Indus Valley Civilization. Throughout the course of its river bed, artifacts have been unearthed that indicates a vibrant community. Archaeological findings on the Sahibi River have confirmed habitations on its banks before the [[Harappa]]n and pre-[[Mahabharata]] periods. Both handmade and wheel-made earthenware dated from 3309–2709 BCE and 2879–2384 BCE has been found on the banks of the Sahibi River at Jodhpura. [[INTACH]]-Rewari found pottery on the Sahibi riverbed at [[Hansaka]] in the Rewari district. A red stone statue of [[Vamana]] Dev was found in the Sahibi riverbed near Bawal in 2002; the statue is now displayed at the Shri Krishna Museum, [[Kurukshetra]].{{citation needed|date=January 2014}} Other artifacts discovered in the Sahibi River include arrowheads, fishhooks, appearheads, awls, and chisels.&lt;ref&gt;A History of Ancient and Early Medieval India from the stone age to the 12th century, Pearson 2009, page 116&lt;/ref&gt;

== Identification with Vedic rivers ==
{{See also|Drishadvati river}} 
Several modern scholars identify the old [[Ghaggar-Hakra River]] (of which Tangri river is a tributary) as the [[Sarasvati river]] and the [[Sahibi River]] with the [[Drishadvati river]] of [[Vedic period]], on the banks of which [[Indus Valley Civilisation|Indus-Sarasvati civilisation]] developed. such scholars include Bhargava&lt;ref&gt;"Location of Brahmavarta and Drishadwati River is important to find earliest alignment of Saraswati River", Sudhir Bhargava, International Conference, 20–22 Nov. 2009, "Saraswati-a perspective" pages 114–117, [[Kurukshetra University]], Kurukshetra, Organised by: Saraswati Nadi Shodh Sansthan, Haryana.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Drishadwati]] River formed one border of the [[Vedic]] state of [[Brahmavarta]] and was mentioned in the ''[[Rigveda]]'', the ''[[Manusmriti]]'', and the ''Brahmin Granths'' texts.

[[File:William Merritt Chase Keying up.jpg|thumb|''"Keying Up" – The Court Jester'' by [[William Merritt Chase]] ([[Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts]])]]
A '''jester''', '''court jester''', or '''fool''', was historically an entertainer during the [[medieval]] and [[Renaissance]] eras who was a member of the household of a nobleman or a [[monarch]] employed to entertain him and his guests. A jester was also an itinerant performer who entertained common folk at fairs and markets. Jesters are also modern-day entertainers who resemble their historical counterparts.

Jesters in medieval times are often thought to have worn brightly coloured clothes and [[Cap and bells|eccentric hats]] in a [[motley]] pattern and their modern counterparts usually mimic this costume. Jesters entertained with a wide variety of skills: principal among them were song, music, and [[storytelling]], but many also employed [[acrobatics]], [[juggling]], telling [[jokes]], and [[Magic (illusion)|magic tricks]]. Much of the entertainment was performed in a comic style and many jesters made contemporary jokes in word or song about people or events well known to their audiences.

==Etymology==
The modern use of the English word ''jester'' did not come into use until the mid-16th century, during Tudor times.&lt;ref name=FJ&gt;{{cite book|last=Soutworth|first=John|title=Fools and Jesters at the English Court|year=1998|publisher=Sutton Publishing|location=Stroud|isbn=0-7509-1773-3|pages=89–93}}&lt;/ref&gt; This modern term derives from the older form ''gestour'', or ''jestour'', originally from Anglo-Norman (French) meaning ''story-teller'' or ''[[minstrel]]''. Other earlier terms included ''fol'', ''disour'', and ''bourder''. These terms described entertainers who differed in their skills and performances but who all shared many similarities in their role as comedic performers for their audiences.&lt;ref name=FJ/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Welsford|first=Enid|title=The Fool: His Social &amp; Literary History|year=1935|publisher=Faber &amp; Faber|location=London|pages=114–115}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Jester|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?allowed_in_frame=0&amp;search=jester&amp;searchmode=none|work=Online Etymology Dictionary|accessdate=28 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Early jesters were popular in Ancient Egypt, and entertained Egyptian pharaohs. The [[ancient Rome|ancient Romans]] had a tradition of professional jesters, called ''[[balatro]]nes''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Horace|Hor]]. Sat. i. 2. 2. (cited by Allen)&lt;/ref&gt; Balatrones were paid for their jests, and the tables of the wealthy were generally open to them for the sake of the amusement they afforded. Jesters were popular with the Aztec people in the 14th to 16th centuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/212748/fool|title=Jester|publisher= Encyclopædia Britannica |accessdate=2012-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===English royal court jesters===
[[File:WillSommers engraving 300dpi.jpg|thumb|left|upright|17th-century engraving of [[William Sommers|Will Sommers]], [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]]'s jester]]
[[Image:Anthonis van Dyck 013.jpg|right|thumb|''Queen Henrietta Maria with Sir Jeffrey Hudson'' by [[Van Dyck]]]]

Many [[Court (royal)|royal courts]] throughout English royal history employed entertainers and most had professional fools, sometimes called ''licensed fools''.  Entertainment included [[early music|music]], [[storytelling]], and [[physical comedy]]. It has also been suggested they performed [[acrobatics]] and [[juggling]].

[[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]] of [[England]] employed a jester named [[William Sommers|Will Sommers]].

During the reigns of [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth I]] and [[James I of England]], [[William Shakespeare]] wrote his plays and performed with his theatre company the [[Lord Chamberlain's Men]] (later called the [[King's Men (playing company)|King's Men]]). Clowns and jesters were featured in Shakespeare's plays, and the company's expert on jesting was [[Robert Armin]], author of the book ''Fooled upon Foole''. In Shakespeare's ''[[Twelfth Night]]'', [[Feste]] the jester is described as "wise enough to play the fool".

[[File:"The Court Jester" (4540421737).jpg|thumb|upright|A court jester, carrying a [[marotte]], selected for the [[Pageant of Empire]] in 1909]]
King [[James VI of Scotland]] employed a jester called [[Archibald Armstrong]]. During his lifetime Armstrong was given great honours at court. He was eventually thrown out of the King's employment when he over-reached and insulted too many influential people. Even after his disgrace, books telling of his jests were sold in London streets. He held some influence at court still in the reign of [[Charles I of England|Charles I]] and estates of land in [[Ireland]]. Charles later employed a jester called [[Jeffrey Hudson]] who was very popular and loyal. Jeffrey Hudson had the title of ''Royal [[Dwarfism|Dwarf]]'' because he was short of stature. One of his jests was to be presented hidden in a giant pie from which he would leap out. Hudson fought on the [[Cavalier|Royalist]] side in the [[English Civil War]]. A third jester associated with Charles I was called [[Muckle John]].

==Political significance==
[[File:Laughing Fool.jpg|thumb|upright|Laughing jester, unknown [[Early Netherlandish painting|Early Netherlandish]] artist (possibly [[Jacob Cornelisz van Oostsanen]]), circa 1500]]

Scholar David Carlyon has cast doubt on the "daring political jester", calling historical tales "apocryphal", and concluding that "popular culture embraces a sentimental image of the clown; writers reproduce that sentimentality in the jester, and academics in the Trickster", but it "falters as analysis".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Carlyon |first=D. |year=2002 |title=The Trickster as Academic Comfort Food |journal=The Journal of American Culture |volume=25 |issue=1–2 |pages=14–18 |doi=10.1111/1542-734X.00003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jesters could also give bad news to the King that no one else would dare deliver. In 1340, when the French fleet was destroyed at the [[Battle of Sluys]] by the English. [[Phillippe VI]]'s jester told him the English sailors "don't even have the guts to jump into the water like our brave French".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Otto |first=Beatrice K |title=Fools Are Everywhere: The Court Jester Around the World |publisher=[[University of Chicago Press]] |year=2001 |page=113}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===End of tradition===
After the [[English Restoration|Restoration]], [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] did not reinstate the tradition of the court jester, but he did greatly patronize the theatre and proto-[[music hall]] entertainments, especially favouring the work of [[Thomas Killigrew]]. Though Killigrew was not officially a jester, [[Samuel Pepys]] in his famous diary does call Killigrew "The King's fool and jester, with the power to mock and revile even the most prominent without penalty" (12 February 1668). The last British nobles to keep jesters were the [[Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon|Queen Mother]]'s family, the Bowes-Lyons.

In the 18th century, jesters had died out except in [[Russia]], [[Spain]] and [[Germany]].  In [[France]] and [[Italy]], travelling groups of jesters performed plays featuring stylized characters in a form of theatre called the ''[[commedia dell'arte]]''. A version of this passed into [[United Kingdom|British]] [[folk tradition]] in the form of a [[puppet]] show, ''[[Punch and Judy]]''. In France the tradition of the court jester ended with the [[French Revolution]].

In 1968, the [[Canada Council]] awarded a $3,500 grant to Joachim Foikis of [[Vancouver]] "to revive the ancient and time-honoured tradition of town fool".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/22907610/|date=May 14, 1968|title=The Corpus Christi Caller-Times|location=Corpus Christi, Texas|page=19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://considerthis.onlinedemocracy.ca/index.php?name=News&amp;file=article&amp;sid=345|title=Northumberland needs county jester to lighten up politics|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928112959/http://considerthis.onlinedemocracy.ca/index.php?name=News&amp;file=article&amp;sid=345|archivedate=Sep 28, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the 21st century, the jester is still seen at medieval-style [[fair]]s and pageants.

In 2015, the town of [[Conwy]] in [[North Wales]] appointed [[Russel Erwood]] (aka [[Erwyd le Fol]]) as the official resident jester of the town and its people, a post that had been vacant since 1295.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.southwales-eveningpost.co.uk/jester-700-years/story-27536385-detail/story.html|title=Welsh medieval town unveils first jester-in-residence for 700 years|date=2015-08-03|newspaper=South Wales Evening Post|access-date=2016-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/news/world/welsh-town-appoints-official-jester-700-years-article-1.2316415|title=Welsh town appoints first official jester in 700 years|newspaper=NY Daily News|access-date=2016-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/wales-news/russel-erwood-town-jester-conwy-9814519|title=This official town jester can balance a flaming barbecue on his head..!|last=Day|first=Liz|date=2015-08-08|newspaper=walesonline|access-date=2016-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Germany]], [[Till Eulenspiegel]] is a folkloric hero dating back to medieval times and ruling each year over [[Fasching]] or [[Carnival]] time,  mocking politicians and public figures of power and authority with [[political satire]] like a modern-day court jester. He holds a mirror to make us aware of our times ([[Zeitgeist]]), and his [[sceptre]], his "bauble"&lt;!--Do not link, as this redirects to Christmas tree ornament.--&gt; or [[marotte]], is the symbol of his power.

[[File:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM Hofnar van de Soesoehoenan die meedanst in de 'Garebeg Moeloed' optocht Java TMnr 10003339.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Susuhunan]] jester who participates in the "Garebeg Moeloed" procession (circa 1920s), [[Java]], [[Indonesia]]]]
In 17th century [[Spain]], [[Dwarfism|little people]], often with deformities, were employed as buffoons to entertain the king and his family, especially the children. In [[Diego Velázquez|Velázquez]]'s painting [[Las Meninas]] two dwarfs are included: Mari Bárbola a female dwarf from [[Germany]] with [[hydrocephalus]], and [[:es:Nicolasito Pertusato|Nicolasito Portusato]] from [[Italy]]. Mari Bárbola can also be seen in a later portrait of [[Margarita Teresa of Spain|princess Margarita Teresa]] in mourning by [[Juan Bautista Martinez del Mazo]]. There are other paintings by Velázquez that include court dwarves such as [[Prince Balthasar Charles With a Dwarf]].

In [[Japan]] from the 13th to 18th centuries, the ''[[taikomochi]]'', a kind of male [[geisha]], attended the feudal lords (''[[daimyō]]s''). They entertained mostly through dancing and storytelling, and were at times counted on for strategic advice. By the 16th century they fought alongside their lord in battle in addition to their other duties.

[[Tonga]] was the first royal court to appoint a court jester in the 20th century; [[Taufa'ahau Tupou IV]], the King of Tonga, appointed [[Jesse Bogdonoff|JD Bogdanoff]] to that role in 1999.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thenoodlebowl.com/jesters/images/reality/jddecree.jpg |format=JPEG |title=Tonga royal decree appointing JD Bogdanoff as court jester |accessdate=2009-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bogdanoff was later embroiled in a financial scandal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/3141297.stm |title=Tongan court jester faces trial |date=11 August 2003 |accessdate=2009-10-29 |publisher=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The jester as a symbol==
The root of the word "fool" is from the Latin ''follis'', which means "bag of wind" or bellows or that which contains air or breath.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=fool|title=Online Etymology Dictionary|website=www.etymonline.com|language=en|access-date=2017-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fool in Tarot===
In [[Tarot cards|Tarot]], [[The Fool (Tarot card)|"The Fool"]] is a card of the [[Major Arcana]].  The tarot depiction of the Fool includes a man (or less often, a woman) [[juggling]] unconcernedly or otherwise distracted, often with a dog or cat at his heels.  The fool is in the act of unknowingly walking off the edge of a cliff, precipice or other high place. (compare: [[Joker (playing card)]]).

===Fool in literature===
In literature, the jester is symbolic of common sense and of honesty, notably in ''[[King Lear]]'', where the court jester is a character used for insight and advice on the part of the monarch, taking advantage of his license to mock and speak freely to dispense frank observations and highlight the folly of his monarch. This presents a clashing irony as a greater man could dispense the same advice and find himself being detained in the dungeons or even executed. Only as the lowliest member of the court can the jester be the monarch's most useful adviser.

Author [[Alan Gordon (author)|Alan Gordon]] also writes about jesters as advisers to the king, who actually make up a super-secret spy ring that try to keep peace and control the leaders of different countries. The Fool's Guild of these novels is portrayed as a mockery to the church, and they refer to [[Jesus Christ]] as "Their Savior, The First Fool".

The [[Shakespearean fool]] is a recurring character type in the works of [[William Shakespeare]].

Shakespearean fools are usually clever peasants or commoners that use their wits to outdo people of higher social standing. In this sense, they are very similar to the real [[fool (stock character)|fool]]s, and jesters of the time, but their characteristics are greatly heightened for theatrical effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=81oZXMaib6IC&amp;pg=PA139&amp;dq=gravediggers++hamlet#PPA17,M1 |title=The fools of Shakespeare: an ... - Frederick B. Warde - Google Boeken |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=2011-12-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; The "groundlings" (theatre-goers who were too poor to pay for seats and thus stood on the 'ground' in the front by the stage) that frequented the Globe Theatre were more likely to be drawn to these Shakespearean fools. However they were also favoured by the nobility.  Most notably, Queen Elizabeth I was a great admirer of the popular actor who portrayed fools, [[Richard Tarlton]].  For Shakespeare himself, however, actor [[Robert Armin]] may have proved vital to the cultivation of the fool character in his many plays.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foolsforhire.com/info/history.html |title=History of the Fool |publisher=Foolsforhire.com |date= |accessdate=2011-12-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern usage==

===Buffoon===
In a similar vein, a '''buffoon''' is someone who provides amusement through inappropriate appearance or behavior.

Originally the term was used to describe a ridiculous but amusing person. The term is now frequently used in a derogatory sense to describe someone considered foolish, or someone displaying inappropriately vulgar, bumbling or ridiculous behavior that is a source of general amusement.

The term originates from the old Italian "buffare", meaning to puff out one's cheeks&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|page=780|title=Encyclopædia Britannica; or A Dictionary of Arts, Sciences, and Miscellaneous Literature, Volume 4|publisher=Archibald Constable and Company|date=1823}}&lt;/ref&gt; that also applies to [[bouffon]].

===Carnival and medieval reenactment===
[[File:VSAN Wgt 2015 476 Markdorf.jpg|thumb|upright|Jester in [[Weingarten, Württemberg|Weingarten]], Germany, in 2015]]

Today, the jester is portrayed in different formats of [[medieval reenactment]] and [[entertainment]], including [[film]], [[Stage (theatre)|stage]] performance, and [[carnival]]. During the Burgundian and the [[Rhenish]] [[carnival in the Netherlands|carnival]], cabaret performances in local dialect are held. In [[North Brabant|Brabant]] this person is called a "tonpraoter" or "sauwelaar", and is actually in or on a barrel. In [[Limburg (Netherlands)|Limburg]] they are named "buuttereedner" or "buutteredner" and in [[Zeeland]] they are called an "ouwoer". They all perform a cabaret speech in dialect, during which many current issues are reviewed. Often there are local situations and celebrities from local and regional politics who are mocked, ridiculed and insulted. The "Tonpraoter" or "Buuttereedner" may be considered successors of the jesters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Home Kalender Nieuws Zoekertjes Albums Copyright |url=http://www.fenvlaanderen.be/carnaval/wat-carnaval |title=Wat is carnaval? &amp;#124; Fen Vlaanderen |publisher=Fenvlaanderen.be |date= |accessdate=2014-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''London Mithraeum''', also known as the '''Temple of Mithras, Walbrook,''' is a [[Roman Britain|Roman]] [[mithraeum]] that was discovered in [[Walbrook]], a street in the [[City of London]], during a building's construction in 1954. The entire site was relocated to permit continued construction and this [[Roman temple|temple]] of the [[Greco-Roman mysteries|mystery]] god [[Mithras]] became perhaps the most famous 20th-century [[Roman Empire|Roman]] discovery in [[London]].

== Excavation and artefacts ==
[[File:White marble relief with Mithras bull-slaying scene (CIMRM 810-811), from Walbrook Mithraeum in Londinium,, AD 180-220, Museum of London (14007820699).jpg|thumb|left|White marble relief depicting Mithras slaying the bull, found at the Walbrook site and on display at the [[Museum of London]]]]
The site was excavated by [[W. F. Grimes]], director of the [[Museum of London]], in 1954.&lt;ref&gt;W. F. Grimes, in ''[[The Illustrated London News]]'', 2, 9, and 16 October 1954.&lt;/ref&gt;  The temple, initially hoped to have been an early Christian church, was built in the mid-3rd century&lt;ref&gt;It was dated to the mid-second century in Maarten J. Vermaseren, "The New Mithraic Temple in London" ''Numen'' '''2'''.1/2 (January 1955), pp. 139-145.&lt;/ref&gt;  and dedicated to [[Mithras]] or perhaps jointly to several deities popular among Roman soldiers. Then it was rededicated, probably to [[Dionysus|Bacchus]], in the early fourth century. Found within the temple, where they had been carefully buried at the time of its rededication, were finely detailed third-century white marble likenesses of [[Minerva]], [[Mercury (mythology)|Mercury]] the [[Psychopomp|guide of the souls of the dead]], and the [[Syncretism|syncretic gods]] [[Mithras]] and [[Serapis]], imported from Italy. There were several coarser locally-made clay figurines of [[Venus (mythology)|Venus]], combing her hair. The artefacts recovered were put on display in the Museum of London.
[[File:Serapis head london.jpg|thumb|upright|Head of Serapis found in the 1954 excavations.]]

Among the sculptures the archaeologists found was a head of [[Mithras]] himself, recognizable by his [[Phrygian cap]]. The base of the head is tapered to fit a torso, which  was not preserved.

Artefacts found in [[Walbrook]] in 1889 probably came from the Mithraeum, according to the archaeologist [[Ralph Merrifield]], although this was not identified at the time (Merrifield 1965, p.&amp;nbsp;179). One was a marble relief, 0.53 m tall, of Mithras in the act of killing the astral bull, the [[Tauroctony]] that was as central to Mithraism as the Crucifixion is to Christianity. On it Mithras is accompanied by the two small figures of the torch-bearing celestial twins of Light and Darkness, [[Cautes and Cautopates]], within the cosmic annual wheel of the [[zodiac]]. At the top left, outside the wheel, [[Helios|Sol–Helios]] ascends the heavens in his ''[[biga (chariot)|biga]]''; at top right Luna descends in her chariot. The heads of two wind-gods, [[Boreas (god)|Boreas]] and [[Zephyros]], are in the bottom corners. It bears the inscription
{{quote|&lt;small&gt;VLPIVS SILVANVS EMERITVS LEG II AVG VOTVM SOLVIT FACTVS ARAVSIONE &lt;/small&gt;}}
which may be translated "Ulpius Silvanus, veteran soldier of the [[Legio II Augusta|Second Augustan Legion]], in fulfilment of a vow, makes this altar [as the result of] a vision" [https://web.archive.org/web/20150220011843/http://www.roman-britain.org/places/londinium.htm] or "Ulpius Silvanus, veteran of the Second Legion Augusta, fulfilled his vow having become (a Mithraist) at Orange" [University of Edinburgh, Classics Department, teaching collection] (Collingwood and Wright 1965, No. 3).
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Mithrastemple6.jpg|thumb|Another view of the temple foundations.]]  --&gt;
Nearby were buried heads of the Roman goddess Minerva and a finely detailed bearded head of [[Serapis]], Jupiter-like in his features but securely recognizable by the grain-basket, the ''[[modius (headdress)|modius]]'', upon his head, a token of [[resurrection]].

An inscription dateable AD 307–310 at the site
{{quote| &lt;small&gt;PRO SALVTE D N CCCC ET NOB CAES DEO MITHRAE ET SOLI INVICTO AB ORIENTE AD OCCIDENTEM&lt;/small&gt;}}
may be translated "For the Salvation of our lords the four emperors and the noble Caesar, and to the god Mithras, the [[Sol Invictus|Invincible Sun]] from the east to the west" (Collingwood and Wright 1965, no. 4).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Togodumnus (Kevan White) |url=http://www.roman-britain.org/places/londinium.htm |title=Londinivm Avgvsta |publisher=Roman-britain.org |date= |accessdate=2012-01-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150220011843/http://www.roman-britain.org/places/londinium.htm |archivedate=20 February 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Parallel to the construction work between 2010 and 2014, [[Museum of London Archaeology]] led a team of over 50 archaeologists in further excavations of the site.&lt;ref name="Yeoman2013"&gt;{{cite news |last=Yeoman |first=Jon |date=6 February 2013 |title=Temple Of Mithras Stays Boxed As City’s Big Dig Continues |url=http://londonist.com/2013/02/temple-of-mithras-stays-boxed-as-citys-big-dig-continues.php |work=[[Londonist]] |accessdate=11 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Excavation recovered more than 14,000 items,{{sfn|Bloomberg|2017|p=9}} including a large assembly of tools. The varied objects are thought to have been brought to the site in landfills and soils collected elsewhere and laid down to improve the marshy banks of the [[River Walbrook]] during the rebuilding of London after the [[Boudica#Boudica.27s_uprising|Boudican revolt]] of AD 60 or 61.{{sfn|Bryan|2017|p=29}}

The local waterlogged soil conditions then preserved even organic material like leather shoes&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title='Entire streets' of Roman London uncovered in the City|date=9 April 2013 |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-22084384|work=[[BBC News]] |accessdate=11 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a large assembly of wooden writing tablets of which over 400 were found. The tablets originally held a layer of dark wax and messages were scratched into the wax with a stylus that revealed the paler wood underneath. The wax has perished, but the words were reconstructed from scratch marks left in the wood.&lt;ref name="LondonMithraeum"&gt;{{cite AV media |year=2017 |title=Voices From Roman London |medium=Television production | location=London | publisher=[[Museum of London Archaeology|MOLA]] |url=https://www.londonmithraeum.com/about}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among the messages is the oldest financial document from London, dated AD 57,{{sfn|Bryan|2017|p=26}} and two addresses from AD 62 and AD 70 containing the earliest mention of London.{{sfn|Bryan|2017|p=23}}

== Relocation history ==
The [[Roman temple]], when it was originally built, would have stood on the east bank of the now covered-over [[Walbrook#Underground river|River Walbrook]], a key freshwater source in Roman [[Londinium]]. Nearby, in its former streambed, a small square hammered lead sheet was found, on which an enemy of someone named Martia Martina had inscribed her name ''backwards'' and thrown the token into the stream, in a traditional [[Celt]]ic way of reaching the gods that has preserved metal tokens in rivers throughout Celtic Europe, from the swords at [[La Tène culture|La Tène]] to Roman times. (Compare [[wishing well]].) The temple foundations are very close to other important sites in the city of London including the historic [[London Stone]], the [[Bank of England]] and [[London Wall]]. The original [[Mithraeum]] was built partly underground, recalling the cave of [[Mithras]] where the Mithraic epiphany took place.

[[File:The Mithraic Temple (geograph 2165391).jpg|thumb|The Mithraeum in 2004 when reassembled at Temple Court, [[Queen Victoria Street, London|Queen Victoria Street]], [[EC postcode area|EC4]]]]

The temple site was uncovered in September 1954 during excavation work for the construction of [[Bucklersbury House]], a 14-storey modernist office block to house [[Legal &amp; General]]. As a compromise between redesigning the new building and abandoning the archaeological site, the ruin was dismantled and moved 100 metres to Temple Court, Queen Victoria Street, where in 1962 the foundations were reassembled at street level for an open-air public display. The reconstruction was not accurate and drew criticism for the materials used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Kennedy|first=Maev|title=Temple of Mithras comes home|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/jan/19/roman-temple-mithras|accessdate=11 April 2013|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=19 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Bryan|2017|p=91}} An interim report on the excavation included in W. F. Grimes, ''The Excavation of Roman and Mediaeval London'' (1968) was superseded by John Shepherd, ''The Temple of Mithras, Walbrook'' (an [[English Heritage]] monograph) (1998).

In 2007 plans were drawn up to return the Mithraeum to its original location, following the demolition of [[Bucklersbury House]] and four other buildings in the block for the planned creation of a new Walbrook Square development, designed by [[Foster and Partners]] and [[Jean Nouvel|Jean Nouvel Architects]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fosterandpartners.com/News/235/Default.aspx Legal &amp; General Launches Walbrook Square] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070317222422/http://www.fosterandpartners.com/News/235/Default.aspx |date=17 March 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, redesigns and disputes between freeholders [[Legal &amp; General]] and [[Metrovacesa]], who had agreed to buy the project, resulted in the Walbrook Square project being put on hold in October 2008, when [[Bovis Lend Lease]] removed their project team.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=|url=http://www.building.co.uk/news/bovis-lend-lease-stands-down-team-at-%C2%A3300m-walbrook-square/3125240.article |title=Bovis Lend Lease stands down team at £300m Walbrook Square &amp;#124; Magazine News |publisher=Building |date=2008-10-17 |accessdate=2012-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Metrovacesa]] left the project in August 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hogg |first=Simon |url=http://www.architectsjournal.co.uk/news/daily-news/walbrook-square-foster-and-nouvel-feel-the-force-of-the-recession/5206169.article |title=Walbrook Square: Foster and Nouvel feel the force of the recession &amp;#124; News |publisher=Architects Journal |date=2009-08-04 |accessdate=2012-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In May 2010 the Mithraeum remained ''in situ'' at Temple Court,&lt;ref&gt;Site visit, 29 May 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; though in the same month there was talk of reviving the Walbrook Square project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite newspaper|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/fb331862-5f7a-11df-a670-00144feab49a.html|title=British Land set to revive 'Cheesegrater'|author=Daniel Thomas|date=15 May 2010|newspaper=Financial Times|accessdate=18 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Walbrook Square project was purchased by the [[Bloomberg L.P.|Bloomberg]] company in 2010, which decided to restore the Mithraeum to its original site as part of their new European headquarters.{{sfn|Bloomberg|2017|p=21}} The new site is {{convert|7|metres}} below the modern street level, as part of an exhibition space beneath the Bloomberg building. The temple was moved a little west of its original position to preserve parts of the walls that were not uncovered in 1952–54 and are too fragile to display today. 

The ruins are reconstructed as they appeared at the end of the excavation in October 1954, reflecting the first building phase of around AD 240 without any later Roman additions to the site. A large majority of the stones and bricks are original. The wood, render and [[lime mortar]] are new, but based on mortar samples from contemporary Roman London structures.{{sfn|Bloomberg|2017|p=15}} The temple is displayed with a selection of artefacts found on the site.

''Man-Eaters of Kumaon'' is the best known of Corbett's books and contains 10 stories of tracking and shooting [[man-eater]]s in the Indian Himalayas during the early years of the twentieth century. The text also contains incidental information on flora, fauna and village life. Seven of the stories were first published privately as '''''Jungle Stories'''''.

==Book contents==

* Just Tigers: Corbett talks about the importance of conservation and his love of photographing tigers in the place of shooting them

==Origins==

After much prompting by friends and family in 1935 Corbett finally put to paper seven accounts of his jungle encounters. These were then made into a small book and 100 copies were privately published under the title ''Jungle Stories'' and distributed amongst friends. The stories were titled, "Wild Life in the Village: An Appeal," "The Pipal Pani Tiger," "The Fish of My Dreams," "A Lost Paradise," "The Terror that Walks by Night," "Purnagiri and Its Mysterious Lights," and "The Chowgarh Tigers."

In 1943, whilst Corbett was wheelchair bound recovering from typhus fever, his close friend (R.E. Hawkins) and manager of India's branch of Oxford Press convinced him to write a book for publishing. Using the 1935 ''Jungle Stories'' as a basis, Corbett wrote ''Man-Eaters of Kumaon'' (10 stories) which was first published by Oxford University Press in 1944.&lt;ref&gt;Jim Corbett, ''My Kumaon: Uncollected Writings'' (India: Oxford University Press, 2012), vii, xv.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sales &amp; success===
[[File:Abramishvili. Man-Eater of Kumaon. 2005.jpg|thumb|250px|"Man-Eater of Kumaon", 2005 painting by [[Merab Abramishvili]].]]
By May 1946 over half a million copies of ''Man-Eaters of Kumaon'' were in print. The book had been translated into four Western languages (including Spanish, Czech and Finnish) as well as six Indian languages. By 1980 the book went on to sell over four million copies worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;Martin Booth, ''Carpet Sahib; A Life of Jim Corbett'' (New York: Oxford University Press, 1991),230.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chhindwara court case===

In Chhindwara, India 1949 Jim Corbett's ''Man-Eaters of Kumaon'' was read out in court by defense for a murder charge. A villager by the name of Todal was found dead in the forest on 19 September 1949. The police's theory was that the accused conspired to murder the victim as he was in love with his wife, the defense was that the victim was killed by a man-eating tiger. Thus the defense produced Corbett's book and read passages relating relevant wounds and circumstances of an attack. The accused was later found not guilty.&lt;ref&gt;Jim Corbett, ''My Kumaon: Uncollected Writings'' (India: Oxford University Press, 2012),137-140.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Film adaptations===

In 1946 Universal Pictures brought the rights to the book and made the film ''[[Man-Eater of Kumaon]]'' (1948). The movie bore no relation to the book and centred on an American played by Wendell Corey who wounds a tiger and is later killed by it. Corbett saw the movie once and claimed that the best actor was the tiger.&lt;ref&gt;Martin Booth, ''Carpet Sahib; A Life of Jim Corbett'' (New York: Oxford University Press, 1991), 230.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1986, the BBC produced a docudrama titled ''Man-Eaters of India'' with [[Frederick Treves (actor)|Frederick Treves]] in the role of Jim Corbett. An IMAX movie, ''[[India: Kingdom of the Tiger]]'', based on Corbett's books, was made in 2002. Corbett was played by [[Christopher Heyerdahl]].

'''Mesa Verde National Park''' is an American [[national park]] and [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage site|World Heritage Site]] located in [[Montezuma County, Colorado|Montezuma County]], [[Colorado]]. The park protects some of the best-preserved [[Ancestral Puebloans|Ancestral Puebloan]] archaeological sites in the United States.

Established by [[United States Congress|Congress]] and President [[Theodore Roosevelt]] in 1906, the park occupies {{convert|52485|acres}} near the [[Four Corners]] region of the American [[Southwestern United States|Southwest]]. With more than 5,000 sites, including 600 [[cliff dwelling]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Mesa Verde National Park {{!}} Mesa Verde Country Colorado |url=https://www.mesaverdecountry.com/see-do/archaeology/mesa-verde-national-park/ |website=Mesa Verde Country Visitor Information Bureau |publisher=Mesa Verde Country Visitor Information Bureau |accessdate=20 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; it is the largest archaeological preserve in the United States.{{Citation needed|reason=superlative not verified by references|date=November 2018}} Mesa Verde (Spanish for "green table") is best known for structures such as [[Cliff Palace]], thought to be the largest cliff dwelling in North America.

Starting {{circa|7500}} BCE, Mesa Verde was seasonally inhabited by a group of nomadic [[Paleo-Indians]] known as the Foothills Mountain Complex. The variety of projectile points found in the region indicates they were influenced by surrounding areas, including the [[Great Basin]], the [[San Juan Basin]], and the [[Rio Grande Valley]]. Later, [[Archaic period in North America|Archaic]] people established semi-permanent rockshelters in and around the [[mesa]]. By 1000 BCE, the [[Basketmaker culture]] emerged from the local Archaic population, and by 750 CE the Ancestral Puebloans had developed from the Basketmaker culture.

The Mesa Verdeans survived using a combination of hunting, gathering, and subsistence farming of crops such as corn, beans, and squash. They built the mesa's first [[pueblo]]s sometime after 650, and by the end of the 12th century, they began to construct the massive cliff dwellings for which the park is best known. By 1285, following a period of social and environmental instability driven by a series of severe and prolonged droughts, they abandoned the area and moved south to locations in Arizona and New Mexico, including [[Chama River (Rio Grande)|Rio Chama]], [[Pajarito Plateau]], and Santa Fe.

==Inhabitants==

===Paleo-Indians===
[[File:Glyptodon old drawing.jpg|left|thumb|alt=A painting of two people hunting a large animal|Paleo-Indians hunting a [[Glyptodontidae|glyptodont]], by [[Heinrich Harder]] {{circa|1920}}]]
The first occupants of the [[Mesa Verde region]], which spans from southeastern Utah to northwestern New Mexico, were nomadic [[Paleo-Indians]] who arrived in the area {{circa|9500}} BCE.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Charles|2006|pp=9–10}}: Paleo-Indians; {{harvnb|Lekson|2015|p=105}}: southeastern Utah to northwestern New Mexico.&lt;/ref&gt; They followed herds of big game and camped near rivers and streams, many of which dried up as the glaciers that once covered parts of the [[San Juan Mountains]] receded. The earliest Paleo-Indians were the [[Clovis culture]] and [[Folsom tradition]], defined largely by the way in which they fashioned [[projectile point]]s. Although they left evidence of their presence throughout the region, there is little indication that they lived in central Mesa Verde during this time.{{sfn|Charles|2006|pp=9–10}}

After 9600 BCE, the area's environment grew warmer and drier, a change that brought to central Mesa Verde pine forests and the animals that thrive in them. Paleo-Indians began inhabiting the mesa in increasing numbers {{circa|7500}}, though it is unclear whether they were seasonal occupants or year-round residents. Development of the [[Spear-thrower|atlatl]] during this period made it easier for them to hunt smaller game, a crucial advance at a time when most of the region's big game had disappeared from the landscape.{{sfn|Charles|2006|p=10}}

===Archaic===
[[File:Barrier Canyon style, Sego Canyon.jpg|thumb|right|alt=A color picture of some Archaic pictographs|Archaic [[Pictogram|pictographs]], {{circa|2500}} BCE, Sego Canyon, Utah]]
6000 BCE marks the beginning of the [[Archaic period in North America]]. Archaeologists differ as to the origin of the Mesa Verde Archaic population; some believe they developed exclusively from local Paleo-Indians, called the Foothills Mountain Complex, but others suggest that the variety of projectile points found in Mesa Verde indicates influence from surrounding areas, including the [[Great Basin]], the [[San Juan Basin]], and the [[Rio Grande Valley]]. The Archaic people probably developed locally, but were also influenced by contact, trade, and intermarriage with immigrants from these outlying areas.{{sfn|Charles|2006|pp=10–11}}

The early Archaic people living near Mesa Verde utilized the atlatl and harvested a wider variety of plants and animals than the Paleo-Indians had, while retaining their primarily nomadic lifestyle. They inhabited the outlying areas of the Mesa Verde region, but also the mountains, mesa tops, and canyons, where they created rockshelters and [[rock art]], and left evidence of animal processing and [[chert]] [[knapping]]. Environmental stability during the period drove population expansion and migration. Major warming and drying from 5000 to 2500 might have led middle Archaic people to seek the cooler climate of Mesa Verde, whose higher elevation brought increased snowpack that, when coupled with spring rains, provided relatively plentiful amounts of water.{{sfn|Charles|2006|pp=10–11}}

By the late Archaic, more people were living in semi-permanent rockshelters that preserved perishable goods such as baskets, sandals, and mats. They started to make a variety of twig figurines that usually resembled sheep or deer. The late Archaic is marked by increased trade in exotic materials such as [[obsidian]] and [[turquoise]]. Marine shells and [[abalone]] from the Pacific coast made their way to Mesa Verde from Arizona, and the Archaic people worked them into necklaces and pendants. Rock art flourished, and people lived in rudimentary houses made of mud and wood. Their early attempts at plant domestication eventually developed into the sustained agriculture that marked the end of the Archaic period, {{circa|1000}}.{{sfn|Charles|2006|pp=11–12}}

===Basketmaker culture===
[[File:Zion National Park Basketmaker II basket specifimen from AD 1 to 700.jpg|left|thumb|alt=A color picture of a woven basket|Basketmaker II basket, {{circa|1 to 500}}]]
With the introduction of corn to the Mesa Verde region {{circa|1000}} BCE and the trend away from nomadism toward permanent [[pit-house|pithouse]] settlements, the Archaic Mesa Verdeans transitioned into what archaeologists call the [[Basketmaker culture]]. [[Late Basketmaker II Era|Basketmaker II]] people are characterized by their combination of foraging and farming skills, use of the atlatl, and creation of finely woven baskets in the absence of earthen pottery. By 300, corn had become the preeminent staple of the Basketmaker II people's diet, which relied less and less on wild food sources and more on domesticated crops.{{sfn|Charles|2006|pp=12–13}}{{efn|Corn was introduced to the Great Sage Plain, the regions north and west of Mesa Verde, from Mexico.{{sfn|Naranjo|2006|p=54}}}}

In addition to the fine basketry for which they were named, Basketmaker II people fashioned a variety of household items from plant and animal materials, including sandals, robes, pouches, mats, and blankets. They also made clay pipes and gaming pieces. Basketmaker men were relatively short and muscular, averaging less than {{convert|5.5|feet}} tall. Their skeletal remains reveal signs of hard labor and extensive travel, including degenerative joint disease, healed fractures, and moderate anemia associated with iron deficiency. They buried their dead near or amongst their settlements, and often included luxury items as gifts, which might indicate differences in relative social status. Basketmaker II people are also known for their distinctive rock art, which can be found throughout Mesa Verde. They depicted animals and people, in both abstract and realistic forms, in single works and more elaborate panels. A common subject was the hunchbacked flute player that the [[Hopi]] call [[Kokopelli]].{{sfn|Charles|2006|pp=14–15}}
[[File:Basket of Basketmaker Pueblo people.jpg|right|thumb|alt=A color picture of a weaved basket|Basketmaker III basket, {{circa|450 to 750}}]]
By 500, CE atlatls were being supplanted by the bow and arrow and baskets by pottery, marking the end of the Basketmaker II Era and the beginning of the [[Basketmaker III Era]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Charles|2006|pp=14–15}}: end of Basketmaker II; {{harvnb|Wilshusen|2006|p=19}} beginning of Basketmaker III.&lt;/ref&gt; Ceramic vessels were a major improvement over [[Pitch (resin)|pitch]]-lined baskets, gourds, and animal hide containers, which had been the primary water storage containers in the region. Pottery also protected seeds against mold, insects, and rodents. By 600, Mesa Verdeans were using clay pots to cook soups and stews.{{sfn|Ortman|2006|p=102}} Year-round settlements first appear around this time. The population of the San Juan Basin increased markedly after 575, when there were very few Basketmaker III sites in Mesa Verde; by the early 7th century, there were many such sites in the mesa. For the next 150 years, villages typically consisted of small groups of one to three residences. The population of Mesa Verde {{circa|675}} was approximately 1,000 to 1,500 people.{{sfn|Wilshusen|2006|pp=19–21}}

Beans and new varieties of corn were introduced to the region {{circa|700}}.{{sfn|Cordell|Van West|Dean|Muenchrath|2007|p=383}} By 775, some settlements had grown to accommodate more than one hundred people; the construction of large, above-ground storage buildings began around this time. Basketmakers endeavored to store enough food for their family for one year, but also retained residential mobility so they could quickly relocate their dwellings in the event of resource depletion or consistently inadequate crop yields.{{sfn|Wilshusen|2006|pp=19–21}} By the end of the 8th century, the smaller hamlets, which were typically occupied for ten to forty years, had been supplanted by larger ones that saw continuous occupation for as many as two generations.{{sfn|Cordell|Van West|Dean|Muenchrath|2007|pp=383–85}} Basketmaker III people established a tradition of holding large ceremonial gatherings near community pit structures.{{sfn|Wilshusen|2006|p=23}}

====Pueblo I: 750 to 900====
{{main|Pueblo I Period}}

750 marks the end of the Basketmaker III Era and the beginning of the Pueblo I period. The transition is characterized by major changes in the design and construction of buildings and the organization of household activities. Pueblo I people doubled their capacity for food storage from one year to two and built interconnected, year-round residences called [[pueblo]]s. Many household activities that had previously been reserved for subterranean pithouses were moved to these above-ground dwellings. This altered the function of pithouses from all-purpose spaces to ones used primarily for community ceremonies, although they continued to house large extended families, particularly during winter months.{{sfn|Wilshusen|2006|pp=23–24}} During the late 8th century, Mesa Verdeans began building square pit structures that archaeologists call proto[[kiva]]s. They were typically {{convert|3 or 4|feet}} deep and {{convert|12 to 20|feet}} wide.{{sfn|Lipe|2006|pp=30–31}}

The first pueblos appeared at Mesa Verde sometime after 650; by 850 more than half of Mesa Verdeans lived in them. As local populations grew, Puebloans found it difficult to survive on hunting, foraging, and gardening, which made them increasingly reliant on domesticated corn. This shift from semi-nomadism to a "sedentary and communal way of life changed ancestral Pueblo society forever".{{sfn|Wilshusen|2006|p=19}} Within a generation the average number of households in these settlements grew from one to three to fifteen to twenty, with average populations of two hundred people. Population density increased dramatically, with as many as a dozen families occupying roughly the same space that had formerly housed two. This brought increased security against raids and encouraged greater cooperation amongst residents. It also facilitated trade and intermarriage between clans, and by the late 8th century, as Mesa Verde's population was being augmented by settlers from the south, four distinct cultural groups occupied the same villages.{{sfn|Wilshusen|2006|pp=19, 24–25}}

Large Pueblo I settlements laid claim to the resources found within {{convert|15 to 30|mi2}}. They were typically organized in groups of at least three and spaced about {{convert|1|mile}} apart. By 860, there were approximately 8,000 people living in Mesa Verde.{{sfn|Wilshusen|2006|p=26}} Within the plazas of larger villages, the Pueblo I people dug massive pit structures of {{convert|800|ft2}} that became central gathering places. These structures represent early architectural expressions of what would eventually develop into the [[Pueblo II Era]] [[Great house (pueblo)|great houses]] of [[Chaco Culture National Historical Park|Chaco Canyon]]. Despite robust growth during the early and mid-9th century, unpredictable rainfall and periodic drought led to a dramatic reversal of settlement trends in the area. Many late Pueblo I villages were abandoned after less than forty years of occupation, and by 880 Mesa Verde's population was in steady decline.{{sfn|Wilshusen|2006|pp=26–27}} The beginning of the 10th century saw widespread depopulation of the region, as people emigrated south of the [[San Juan River (Colorado River)|San Juan River]] to Chaco Canyon in search of reliable rains for farming.{{sfn|Lipe|2006|p=29}} As Mesa Verdeans migrated south, to where many of their ancestors had emigrated two hundred years before, the influence of Chaco Canyon grew, and by 950 Chaco had supplanted Mesa Verde as the region's cultural center.{{sfn|Wilshusen|2006|pp=26–27}}

====Pueblo II: 900 to 1150====
{{main|Pueblo II Period}}
[[File:Square Tower House by RO.JPG|thumb|right|alt=A color picture of a large sandstone ruin under an alcove|Square Tower House]]
The Pueblo II Period is marked by the growth and outreach of communities centered around the great houses of Chaco Canyon. Despite their participation in the vast Chacoan system, Mesa Verdeans retained a distinct cultural identity while melding regional innovation with ancient tradition, inspiring further architectural advancements; the 9th century Mesa Verdean pueblos influenced two hundred years of Chacoan great house construction.{{sfn|Lipe|2006|p=29}} Droughts during the late 9th century rendered Mesa Verdean dry land farming unreliable, which led to their growing crops only near drainages for the next 150 years. Crop yields returned to healthy levels by the early 11th century.{{sfn|Adams|2006|pp=3–4}} By 1050 the population of the area began to rebound; as agricultural prosperity increased, people immigrated to Mesa Verde from the south. {{sfn|Lipe|2006|p=29}}

Mesa Verdean farmers increasingly relied on masonry reservoirs during the Pueblo II Era. During the 11th century, they built [[check dam]]s and terraces near drainages and slopes in an effort to conserve soil and runoff. These fields offset the danger of crop failures in the larger dry land fields.{{sfn|Lipe|2006|p=34}} By the mid-10th and early 11th centuries, protokivas had evolved into smaller circular structures called kivas, which were usually {{convert|12 to 15|feet}} across. These Mesa Verde-style kivas included a feature from earlier times called a [[sipapu]], which is a hole dug in the north of the chamber and symbolizes the Ancestral Puebloan's place of emergence from the underworld.{{sfn|Lipe|2006|pp=30–31}} At this time, Mesa Verdeans began to move away from the post and mud [[jacal]]-style buildings that marked the Pueblo I Period toward masonry construction, which had been utilized in the region as early as 700, but was not widespread until the 11th and 12th centuries.{{sfn|Lipe|2006|pp=32–33}}

The expansion of Chacoan influence in the Mesa Verde area left its most visible mark in the form of Chaco-style masonry great houses that became the focal point of many Mesa Verdean villages after 1075.{{sfn|Lipe|2006|p=29}} Far View House, the largest of these, is considered a classic Chaco "outlier," on which construction likely began between 1075 and 1125, although some archaeologists argue that it was begun as early as 1020.&lt;ref name=ChacoMeridian&gt;Lekson, Stephen. ''The Chaco Meridian: One Thousand Years of Political and Religious Power in the Ancient Southwest''. Rowman &amp; Littlefield, 2015&lt;/ref&gt; The era's timber and earth unit pueblos were typically inhabited for about twenty years.{{sfn|Varien|2006|p=42}} During the early 12th century, the locus of regional control shifted away from Chaco to [[Aztec Ruins National Monument|Aztec]], New Mexico, in the southern Mesa Verde region.{{sfn|Lipe|2006|p=29}}{{efn|Donna Glowacki refutes this position, suggesting that the people of Aztec never achieved the wide-spread influence of Chaco Canyon. She believes the relationship between Mesa Verde and Aztec was more likely one of competition and conflict, versus religious or social hegemony.{{sfn|Varien|2006|p=44}}}} By 1150, drought had once again stressed the region's inhabitants, leading to a temporary cessation of great house construction at Mesa Verde.{{sfn|Lipe|2006|p=30}}

====Pueblo III: 1150 to 1300====
{{main|Pueblo III Period}}
[[File:Cliff Palace.JPG|thumb|left|alt=A color picture of a large sandstone ruins, with green trees below and blue sky above|Cliff Palace is the largest cliff dwelling in Mesa Verde National Park.{{sfn|Varien|2006|p=41}}]]
A severe drought from 1130 to 1180 led to rapid depopulation in many parts of the San Juan Basin, particularly at Chaco Canyon. As the extensive Chacoan system collapsed, people increasingly migrated to Mesa Verde, causing major population growth in the area. This led to much larger settlements of six to eight hundred people, which reduced mobility for Mesa Verdeans, who had in the past frequently relocated their dwellings and fields as part of their agriculture strategy. In order to sustain these larger populations, they dedicated more and more of their labor to farming. Population increases also led to expanded tree felling that reduced habitat for many wild plant and animal species that the Mesa Verdeans had relied on, further deepening their dependency on domesticated crops that were susceptible to drought-related failure.{{sfn|Cordell|Van West|Dean|Muenchrath|2007|pp=385–86, 398–99}}

The Chacoan system brought large quantities of imported goods to Mesa Verde during the late 11th and early 12th centuries, including pottery, shells, and turquoise, but by the late 12th century, as the system collapsed, the amount of goods imported by the mesa quickly declined, and Mesa Verde became isolated from the surrounding region.{{sfn|Lipe|2006|p=36}} For approximately six hundred years, most Mesa Verdean farmers had lived in small, mesa-top homesteads of one or two families. They were typically located near their fields and walking distance to sources of water. This practice continued into the mid- to late 12th century, but by the start of the 13th century they began living in canyon locations that were close to water sources and within walking distance of their fields.{{sfn|Varien|2006|pp=40–41}}

Mesa Verdean villages thrived during the mid-Pueblo III Era, when architects constructed massive, multi-story buildings, and artisans adorned pottery with increasingly elaborate designs. Structures built during this period have been described as "among the world's greatest archaeological treasures".{{sfn|Varien|2006|p=39}} Pueblo III masonry buildings were typically occupied for approximately fifty years, more than double the usable lifespan of the Pueblo II jacal structures. Others were continuously inhabited for two hundred years or more. Architectural innovations such as towers and multi-walled structures also appear during the Pueblo III Era. Mesa Verde's population remained fairly stable during the 12th century drought.{{sfn|Varien|2006|pp=42–44}} At the start of the 13th century, approximately 22,000 people lived there.{{sfn|Cordell|Van West|Dean|Muenchrath|2007|p=385}} The area saw moderate population increases during the following decades, and dramatic ones from 1225 to 1260.{{sfn|Varien|2006|p=44}} Most of the people in the region lived in the plains west of the mesa at locations such as [[Yellow Jacket Pueblo]], near Cortez, Colorado.{{sfn|Lekson|2015|p=105}} Others colonized canyon rims and slopes in multi-family structures that grew to unprecedented size as populations swelled.{{sfn|Kantner|2004|pp=161–66}} By 1260, the majority of Mesa Verdeans lived in large pueblos that housed several families and more than one hundred people.{{sfn|Varien|2006|pp=40–41}}

The 13th century saw 69 years of below average rainfall in the Mesa Verde region, and after 1270 the area suffered from especially cold temperatures. [[Dendrochronology]] indicates that the last tree felled for construction on the mesa was cut in 1281.{{sfn|Varien|2006|pp=40, 46}} There was a major decline in [[ceramic]] imports to the region during this time, but local production remained steady.{{sfn|Glowacki|Neff|Glascock|1998|p=218}} Despite challenging conditions, the Puebloans continued to farm the area until a severely dry period from 1276 to 1299 ended seven hundred years of continuous human occupation at Mesa Verde.{{sfn|Adams|2006|pp=3–4}} Archaeologists refer to this period as the "Great Drought".{{sfn|Cameron|2006|p=140}} The last inhabitants of the mesa left the area {{circa|1285}}.{{sfn|Varien|2006|p=46}}

====Warfare====
[[File:Oak Tree House by RO.JPG|thumb|right|alt=A color picture of a large sandstone cliff dwelling|Oak Tree House]]
During the Pueblo III period (1150 to 1300), Mesa Verdeans built numerous stone masonry towers that likely served as defensive structures. They often incorporated hidden tunnels connecting the towers to associated kivas.{{sfn|Kuckelman|2006|p=128}} Warfare was conducted using the same tools the Mesa Verdeans used for hunting game, including bows and arrows, stone axes, and wooden clubs and spears. They also crafted hide and basket shields that were used only during battles.{{sfn|Kuckelman|2006|p=131}} Periodic warfare occurred on the mesa throughout the 13th century.{{sfn|Varien|2006|p=44}} Civic leaders in the region likely attained power and prestige by distributing food during times of drought. This system probably broke down during the "Great Drought", leading to intense warfare between competing clans.{{sfn|Cameron|2006|pp=140–41}} Increasing economic and social uncertainty during the century's final decades led to widespread conflict. Evidence of partly burned villages and post-mortem trauma have been uncovered, and the residents of one village appear to have been the victims of a site-wide massacre.{{sfn|Cordell|Van West|Dean|Muenchrath|2007|pp=386, 398}}

Evidence of violence and [[cannibalism]] has been documented in the central Mesa Verde region.{{sfn|Lipe|2006|p=37}}{{efn|The earliest known evidence for large-scale violence in the region was uncovered in southeastern Utah. Future Mesa Verde rediscoverer, [[Richard Wetherill]], then leading the [[Hyde Exploring Expedition]], located the site, now called "Cave 7", in which the bodies of nearly 100 men, women, and children were found. They date to the late Basketmaker II period (200 BCE to 500 CE). Evidence of defensive structures, such as palisades and stockades, dating to the 7th and 11th centuries have been uncovered near ancient Mesa Verdean farmsteads.{{sfn|Kuckelman|2006|p=127}}}} While most of the violence, which peaked between 1275 and 1285, is generally ascribed to in-fighting amongst Mesa Verdeans, archaeological evidence found at Sand Canyon Pueblo, in [[Canyons of the Ancients National Monument]], suggests that violent interactions also occurred between Mesa Verdeans and people from outside the region.{{sfn|Varien|2006|p=44}} Evidence of the attacks was discovered by members of the [[Crow Canyon Archaeological Center]] during the 1990s. The assaults, which also occurred at the national monument's Castle Rock Pueblo, were dated to {{circa|1280}}, and are considered to have effectively ended several centuries of Puebloan occupation at those sites.{{sfn|Kuckelman|2006|p=127}} Many of the victims showed signs of skull fractures, and the uniformity of the injuries suggest that most were inflicted with a small stone axe. Others were [[Scalping|scalped]], dismembered, and cannibalized. The anthropophagy (cannibalism) might have been undertaken as a survival strategy during times of starvation.{{sfn|Kuckelman|2006|pp=132–33}} The archaeological record indicates that, rather than being isolated to the Mesa Verde region, violent conflict was widespread in North America during the late 13th and early 14th centuries, and was likely exacerbated by global climate changes that negatively affected food supplies throughout the continent.{{sfn|Kuckelman|2006|p=134}}

====Migration====
The Mesa Verde region saw unusually cold and dry conditions during the beginning of the 13th century. This might have driven emigration to Mesa Verde from less hospitable locations. The added population stressed the mesa's environment, further straining an agricultural society that was suffering from drought.{{sfn|Kohler|2006|p=73}} The region's bimodal precipitation pattern, which brought rainfall during spring and summer and snowfall during autumn and winter, began to fail post-1250.{{sfn|Cameron|2006|p=140}} After 1260, there was a rapid depopulation of Mesa Verde, as "tens of thousands of people" emigrated or died from starvation.{{sfn|Varien|2006|p=44}} Many smaller communities in the Four Corners region were also abandoned during this period.{{sfn|Casey|1993|p=220}}{{sfn|Watson|1961|p=156}} The Ancestral Puebloans had a long history of migration in the face of environmental instability, but the depopulation of Mesa Verde at the end of the 13th century was different in that the region was almost completely emptied, and no descendants returned to build permanent settlements.{{sfn|Varien|2006|p=45}} While drought, resource depletion, and overpopulation all contributed to instability during the last two centuries of Ancestral Puebloan occupation, their overdependence on maize crops is considered the "fatal flaw" of their subsistence strategy.{{sfn|Kuckelman|2006|p=135}}{{efn|When the Spanish first settled in the area in 1598, they proposed that the Utes and Navajo had driven the Ancestral Puebloans away from Mesa Verde.{{sfn|Cameron|2006|p=141}} In 1891, Gustaf Nordenskiöld proposed that the Mesa Verdeans had been driven away from the area by hostile intruders. In the early 20th century, Jesse Walter Fewkes theorized that climate change had adversely affected water supplies in the region, which led to widespread crop failure and the rapid depopulation of the area. The last two theories remain at the foreground of the archaeological investigation of Mesa Verde.{{sfn|Cameron|2006|p=139}}}}

The vacating Mesa Verdeans left almost no direct evidence of their migration, but they left behind household goods, including cooking utensils, tools, and clothing, which gave archaeologists the impression that the emigration was haphazard or hurried. An estimated 20,000 people lived in the region during the 13th century, but by the start of the 14th century the area was nearly uninhabited.{{sfn|Cameron|2006|pp=139-41}}{{efn|Contemporary Native Americans do not describe the region as abandoned, but rather view it as a stage in the area's ongoing indigenous culture.{{sfn|Cameron|2006|p=139}}}} Many emigrants relocated to southern Arizona and New Mexico.{{sfn|Wenger|1991|p=74}} Although the rate of settlement is unclear, increases in sparsely populated areas, such as [[Chama River (Rio Grande)|Rio Chama]], [[Pajarito Plateau]], and Santa Fe, correspond directly with the period of migration from Mesa Verde. Archaeologists believe the Mesa Verdeans who settled in the areas near the Rio Grande, where Mesa Verde black-on-white pottery became widespread during the 14th century, were likely related to the households they joined and not unwelcome intruders. Archaeologists view this migration as a continuation, versus a dissolution, of Ancestral Puebloan society and culture.{{sfn|Cordell|Van West|Dean|Muenchrath|2007|pp=395–98}} Many others relocated to the banks of the [[Little Colorado River]], in western New Mexico and eastern Arizona.{{sfn|Cameron|2006|p=144}} While archaeologists tend to focus on the [[Human migration|"push"]] factors that drove the Mesa Verdeans away from the region, there were also several environmental "pull factors", such as warmer temperatures, better farming conditions, plentiful timber, and [[bison]] herds, which incentivized relocation to the area near the Rio Grande.{{sfn|Cameron|2006|pp=144–45}} In addition to numerous settlements along the Rio Grande, contemporary descendants of the Mesa Verdeans live in pueblos at [[Acoma Pueblo|Acomo]], [[Zuni Pueblo, New Mexico|Zuni]], [[Jemez Pueblo, New Mexico|Jemez]], and [[Laguna Pueblo|Laguna]].{{sfn|Cameron|2006|p=139}}{{efn|During this time, the entirety of the Zuni people are believed to have migrated to western New Mexico. Archaeological evidence suggests that another large group of Mesa Verdeans migrated approximately {{convert|200|miles}} to southwestern New Mexico, where they built structures that are now known as Pinnacle Ruin.{{sfn|Cameron|2006|p=142}}}}

====Organization====
Although Chaco Canyon might have exerted regional control over Mesa Verde during the late 11th and early 12th centuries, most archaeologists view the Mesa Verde region as a collection of smaller communities based on central sites and related outliers that were never fully integrated into a larger civic structure.{{sfn|Hurst|Till|2006|p=77}} Several ancient roads, averaging {{convert|15 to 45|feet}} wide and lined with earthen [[berm]]s, have been identified in the region. Most appear to connect communities and shrines; others encircle great house sites. The extent of the network is unclear, but no roads have been discovered leading to the Chacoan [[Great North Road (Ancestral Puebloans)|Great North Road]], or directly connecting Mesa Verde and Chacoan sites.{{sfn|Hurst|Till|2006|p=79}}

Ancestral Puebloan shrines, called ''[[Herradura (Ancestral Puebloans)|herradura]]s'', have been identified near road segments in the region. Their purpose is unclear, but several C-shaped herraduras have been excavated, and they are thought to have been "directional shrines" used to indicate the location of great houses.{{sfn|Hurst|Till|2006|p=80}}{{efn|Similar structures are used by modern Pueblo people.{{sfn|Hurst|Till|2006|p=80}}}}

====Architecture====
[[File:Cyark elevation fire temple.jpg|left|thumb|Section view of Kiva A in Mesa Verde's Fire Temple, cut from laser scan data collected by a [[CyArk]]/[[National Park Service]] partnership. Since Fire Temple was at least partially built to conform to the dimensions of the cliff alcove in which it was built, it is neither round in form nor truly subterranean like other structures generally defined as [[kiva]]s.]]
Mesa Verde is best known for a large number of well-preserved cliff dwellings, houses built in alcoves, or rock overhangs along the [[canyon]] walls. The structures contained within these alcoves were mostly blocks of hard [[sandstone]], held together and plastered with [[adobe]] mortar. Specific constructions had many similarities but were generally unique in form due to the individual topography of different alcoves along the canyon walls. In marked contrast to earlier constructions and villages on top of the mesas, the cliff dwellings of Mesa Verde reflected a region-wide trend towards the aggregation of growing regional populations into close, highly defensible quarters during the 13th century.{{sfn|Wenger|1991|pp=13, 47–59}}

Pueblo buildings were built with stone, windows facing south, and in ''U,'' ''E'' and ''L'' shapes.  The buildings were located more closely together and reflected deepening religious celebration. Towers were built near kivas and likely used for lookouts. Pottery became more versatile, including pitchers, ladles, bowls, jars and dishware for food and drink. White pottery with black designs emerged, the pigments coming from plants. Water management and conservation techniques, including the use of reservoirs and silt-retaining dams, also emerged during this period.{{sfn|Wenger|1991|pp=9–13, 24}}
Styles for these sandstone/mortar constructions, both surface and cliff dwellings, included T-shaped windows and doors. This has been taken by some archaeologists, including Stephen H. Lekson, as evidence of the continuing reach of the Chacoan system.{{sfn|Lekson|2015|pp=158, 175–80}} Other researchers see these elements as part of a more generalized Puebloan style or spiritual significance rather than evidence of a continuing specific elite socioeconomic system.&lt;ref&gt;Phillips, David A., Jr., 2000, [http://www.unm.edu/~dap/meridian/meridian.html "The Chaco Meridian: A skeptical analysis"] paper presented to the 65th annual meeting of the Society of American Archaeology, Philadelphia.&lt;/ref&gt;

While much of the construction in these sites is consistent with common Pueblo architectural forms, including kivas, towers, and [[Pit house#American Southwest|pit-houses]], the space constrictions of these alcoves necessitated what seems to have been a far denser concentration of their populations. Mug House, a typical cliff dwelling of the period, was home to around 100 people who shared 94 small rooms and eight kivas built against each other and sharing many of their walls; builders in these areas maximized space in any way they could, with no areas considered off-limits to construction.{{sfn|Kantner|2004|pp=161–66}}

====Astronomy====
[[File:Sun Temple by RO.JPG|thumb|right|alt=A color picture of a large sandstone ruin|The Sun Temple at Mesa Verde]]
Mesa Verdeans used astronomical observations to plan their farming and religious ceremonies, drawing on both natural features in the landscape and masonry structures built for this purpose. Several great houses in the region were aligned to the [[cardinal direction]]s, which positioned windows, doors, and walls along the path of the sun, whose rays would indicate the passing of seasons. Mesa Verde's Sun Temple is thought to have been an astronomical observatory.{{sfn|Hurst|Till|2006|p=83}}

The temple is D-shaped, and its alignment is 10.7 degrees off true east-west.{{sfn|Malville|2006|p=90}} Its location and orientation indicate that its builders understood the cycles of both the sun and the moon.{{sfn|Malville|2006|p=89}} It is aligned to the major [[lunar standstill]], which occurs once every 18.6 years, and the sunset during the [[winter solstice]], which can be viewed setting over the temple from a platform at the south end of Cliff Palace, across Fewkes Canyon. At the bottom of the canyon is the Sun Temple fire pit, which is illuminated by the first rays of the rising sun during the winter solstice. Sun Temple is one of the largest exclusively ceremonial structures ever built by the Ancestral Puebloans.{{sfn|Malville|2006|pp=85, 90–91}}{{efn|Painted wavy lines in the square tower at Cliff Palace average 18.6 marks each, suggesting that people recorded four of these events there.{{sfn|Malville|2006|p=91}} Jesse Walter Fewkes named the building Sun Temple after finding rock art in the southwest corner of the site depicting the sun.{{sfn|Malville|2006|p=90}}}}

====Agriculture and water-control systems====
[[File:Mesa verde far view procession 6.jpg|thumb|left|alt=A color picture of a long masonry wall|Far View Reservoir]]
Starting in the 6th century, the farmers living in central Mesa Verde cultivated corn, beans, squash, and gourds. The combination of corn and beans provided the Mesa Verdeans with the amino acids of a [[complete protein]]. When conditions were good, {{convert|3 or 4|acres}} of land would provide enough food for a family of three or four individuals for one year, providing they supplemented with game and wild plants. As Mesa Verdeans increasingly relied on corn as a dietary staple, the success or failure of crop yields factored heavily into their lives. The mesa tilts slightly to the south, which increased its exposure to the sun.{{sfn|Adams|2006|pp=1–4}} Before the introduction of pottery, foods were baked, roasted, and parched. Hot rocks dropped into containers could bring water to a brief boil, but because beans must be boiled for an hour or more their use was not widespread until after pottery had disseminated throughout the region. With the increased availability of ceramics after 600, beans became much easier to cook. This provided a high quality protein that reduced reliance on hunting. It also aided corn cultivation, as [[legumes]] add much needed nutrients to soils they are grown in, which likely increased corn yields.{{sfn|Ortman|2006|pp=102–03}}

The most Mesa Verdeans practiced [[Dryland farming|dry farming]], which relied on rain to water their crops, but others utilized runoff, springs, [[Seep (hydrology)|seeps]], and natural collection pools. Starting in the 9th century, they dug and maintained reservoirs that caught runoff from summer showers and spring snowmelt; some crops were watered by hand.{{sfn|Lipe|2006|pp=33–34}} Archaeologists believe that prior to the 13th century, springs and other sources of water were considered shared public resources, but as Mesa Verdeans moved into increasingly larger pueblos built near or around water supplies control was privatized and limited to members of the surrounding community.{{sfn|Hurst|Till|2006|p=78}}

Between 750 and 800, Mesa Verdeans began constructing two large water containment structures in canyon bottoms&amp;nbsp;– the Morefield and Box Elder reservoirs. Soon afterward, work began on two more: the Far View and Sagebrush reservoirs, which were approximately {{convert|90|feet}} across and constructed on the mesa top. The reservoirs lie on an east-west line that runs for approximately {{convert|6|miles}}, which suggests builders followed a centralized plan for the system. In 2004, the [[American Society of Civil Engineers]] designated these four structures as [[National Civil Engineering Historic Landmark]]s.{{sfn|Wright|2006|pp=123–24}} A 2014 geospatial analyses suggested that neither collection nor retention of water was possible in the Far View Reservoir. This interpretation views the structure as a ceremonial space with procession roads in an adaptation of Chacoan culture.{{sfn|Benson et al.|2014|pp=164–79}}

====Hunting and foraging====
[[File:Ancestral Puebloan bone awls by RO.JPG|thumb|right|alt=A color picture of three long bone tools||Ancestral Puebloan bone awls]]
Mesa Verdeans typically harvested local small game, but sometimes organized hunting parties that traveled long distances. Their main sources of animal protein came from [[mule deer]] and rabbits, but they occasionally hunted Bighorn sheep, antelope, and elk.{{sfn|Adams|2006|p=6}} They began to domesticate turkeys starting around 1000, and by the 13th century consumption of the animal peaked, supplanting deer as the primary protein source at many sites. These domesticated turkeys consumed large amounts of corn, which further deepened reliance on the staple crop.{{sfn|Kohler|2006|p=72}} Puebloans wove blankets from turkey feathers and rabbit fur, and made implements such as [[Stitching awl|awls]] and needles from turkey and deer bones. Despite the availability of fish in the area's rivers and streams, archaeological evidence suggests that they were rarely eaten.{{sfn|Adams|2006|p=6}}

Mesa Verdeans supplemented their diet by gathering the seeds and fruits of wild plants, searching large expanses of land while procuring these resources. Depending on the season, they collected piñon nuts and juniper berries, weedy goosefoot, pigweed, purslane, [[tomatillo]], [[Descurainia sophia|tansy mustard]], [[Sphaeralcea|globe mallow]], sunflower seeds, and [[yucca]], as well as various species of grass and cacti. [[Opuntia|Prickly pear]] fruits provided a rare source of natural sugar. Wild seeds were cooked and ground up into porridge. They used [[sagebrush]] and [[Cercocarpus|mountain mahogany]], along with piñon and juniper, for firewood. They also smoked wild tobacco.{{sfn|Adams|2006|pp=4–6}} Because the Ancestral Puebloans considered all material consumed and discarded by their communities as sacred, their [[midden]] piles were viewed with reverence. Starting during the Basketmaker III period, {{circa|700}}, Mesa Verdeans often buried their dead in these mounds.{{sfn|Hurst|Till|2006|p=83}}

====Pottery====

Scholars are divided as to whether pottery was invented in the Four Corners region or introduced from the south. Specimens of shallow, unfired clay bowls found at [[Canyon de Chelly National Monument|Canyon de Chelly]] indicate the innovation might have been derived from using clay bowls to parch seeds. Repeated uses rendered these bowls hard and impervious to water, which might represent the first fired pottery in the region. An alternate theory suggests that pottery originated in the [[Mogollon Rim]] area to the south, where brown-paste bowls were used during the first few centuries of the [[common era]].{{sfn|Ortman|2006|p=101}} Others believe pottery was introduced to Mesa Verde from Mexico, {{circa|300}} CE.{{sfn|Lang|2006|p=61}} There is no evidence of ancient pottery markets in the region, but archaeologists believe that local potters exchanged decorative wares between families. Cooking pots made with crushed [[igneous rock]] [[Ceramics of indigenous peoples of the Americas#Tempers|tempers]] from places like [[Ute Mountain]] were more resilient and desirable, and Puebloans from throughout the region traded for them.{{sfn|Ortman|2006|pp=104–06}}

[[Neutron activation analysis]] indicates that much of the black-on-white pottery found at Mesa Verde was produced locally. [[Cretaceous]] clays from both the [[Dakota Formation|Dakota]] and [[Menefee Formation]]s were used in black-on-white wares, and Mancos Formation clays for corrugated jars.{{sfn|Glowacki|Neff|Glascock|1998|pp=231, 234, 237}}{{efn|Mancos shale was the most commonly used clay in the region, particularly for non-decorated grey wares.{{sfn|Lang|2006|p=61}}}} Evidence that pottery of both types moved between several locations around the region suggests interaction between groups of ancient potters, or they might have shared a common source of raw materials.{{sfn|Glowacki|Neff|Glascock|1998|pp=231, 234, 237}} The Mesa Verde black-on-white pottery was produced at three locations: Sand Canyon, Castle Rock, and Mesa Verde.{{sfn|Glowacki|Neff|Glascock|1998|p=238}} Archeological evidence indicates that nearly every household had at least one member who worked as a potter. Trench kilns were constructed away from pueblos and closer to sources of firewood. Their sizes vary, but the larger ones were up to {{convert|24|feet}} long and thought to have been shared kilns that served several families. Designs were added to ceramic vessels with a Yucca-leaf brush and paints made from iron, [[manganese]], [[Cleome|beeplant]], and tansy mustard.{{sfn|Ortman|2006|pp=103–05}}

Most of the pottery found in 9th century pueblos was sized for individuals or small families, but as communal ceremonialism expanded during the 13th century, many larger, feast–sized vessels were produced.{{sfn|Ortman|2006|pp=106}} Corrugated decorations appear on Mesa Verde grey wares after 700, and by 1000 entire vessels were crafted in this way. The technique created a rough exterior surface that was easier to hold on to than regular grey wares, which were smooth.{{sfn|Lang|2006|p=62}} By the 11th century these corrugated vessels, which dissipated heat more efficiently than smoother ones, had largely replaced the older style, whose tendency to retain heat made them prone to boiling over.{{sfn|Ortman|2006|p=103}} Corrugation likely developed as ancient potters attempted to mimic the visual properties of coiled basketry.{{sfn|Ortman|2006|pp=106–07}} Corrugated wares were made using clay from formations other than Menefee, which suggests that ancient potters selected different clays for different styles.{{sfn|Glowacki|Neff|Glascock|1998|p=238}} Potters also selected clays and altered firing conditions to achieve specific colors. Under normal conditions, pots made of Mancos shale turned grey when fired, and those made of Morrison Formation clay turned white. Clays from southeastern Utah turned red when fired in a high-oxygen environment.{{sfn|Ortman|2006|p=103}}

====Rock art and murals====

Rock art is found throughout the Mesa Verde region, but its dispersion is uneven and periodic. Some locations have numerous examples; others have none, and some periods saw prolific creation, while others saw little. Styles also vary over time. Examples are relatively rare on Mesa Verde proper, but abundant in the middle San Juan River area, which might indicate the river's importance as a travel route and key source of water. Common [[Motif (visual arts)|motif]]s in the rock art of the region include, anthropomorphic figures in procession and during copulation or childbirth, handprints, animal and people tracks, wavy lines, spirals, concentric circles, animals, and hunting scenes.{{sfn|Hurst|Till|2006|p=81}} As the region's population plummeted during the late 13th century, the subject of Mesa Verdean rock art increasingly shifted to depictions of shields, warriors, and battle scenes.{{sfn|Kuckelman|2006|p=132}} Modern Hopi have interpreted the [[petroglyph]]s at Mesa Verde's Petroglyph Point as depictions of various clans of people.{{sfn|National Park Service|1986|pp=10–11}}

Starting during the late Pueblo II period (1020) and continuing through Pueblo III (1300), the Ancestral Puebloans of the Mesa Verde region created plaster [[mural]]s in their great houses, particularly in their kivas. The murals contained both painted and inscribed images depicting animals, people, and designs used in textiles and pottery dating back as far as Basketmaker III, {{circa|500}}. Others depict triangles and mounds thought to represent mountains and hills in the surrounding landscape. The murals were typically located on the face of the kiva bench and usually encircled the room. Geometric patterns that resemble symbols used in pottery and zigzag that represent stitches used in basket making are common motifs. The painted murals include the colors red, green, yellow, white, brown, and blue. The designs were still in use by the Hopi during the 15th and 16th centuries.{{sfn|Cole|2006|pp=93–98}}

==Anthropogenic ecology, geography, and climate==
Anthropogenic ecology refers to the human impact on animals and plants in an ecosystem.{{sfn|Adams|2006|p=6}} A shift from medium and large game animals, such as deer, bighorn sheep, and antelope, to smaller ones like rabbits and turkey during the mid-10th to mid-13th centuries might indicate that Mesa Verdean subsistence hunting had dramatically altered faunal populations on the mesa.{{sfn|Cordell|Van West|Dean|Muenchrath|2007|p=386}} Analysis of [[pack rat]] midden indicates that, with the exception of invasive species such as [[tumbleweed]] and [[clover]], the flora and fauna in the area have remained relatively consistent for the past 4,000 years.{{sfn|Adams|2006|pp=1–3}}

Mesa Verde's canyons were created by streams that eroded the hard sandstone that covers the area. This resulted in Mesa Verde National Park elevations ranging from about {{convert|6000|to|8572|ft|m}}, the highest elevation at Park Point.  The terrain in the park is now a transition zone between the low desert plateaus and the [[Rocky Mountains]].{{sfn|Wenger|1991|pp=9–13, 24}}

The region's precipitation pattern is bimodal, meaning agriculture is sustained through snowfall during winter and autumn and rainfall during spring and summer.{{sfn|Cameron|2006|p=140}} The climate is semi-arid. Water for farming and consumption was provided by summer rains, winter snowfall, and seeps and springs in and near the Mesa Verde villages. At {{convert|7000|ft|m}}, the middle mesa areas were typically ten degrees Fahrenheit (5.5&amp;nbsp;°C) cooler than the mesa top, which reduced the amount of water needed for farming.{{sfn|Wenger|1991|p=15}} The cliff dwellings were built to take advantage of solar energy. The angle of the sun in winter warmed the masonry of the cliff dwellings, warm breezes blew from the valley, and the air was ten to twenty degrees warmer in the canyon alcoves than on the top of the mesa. In the summer, with the sun high overhead, much of the village was protected from direct sunlight in the high cliff dwellings.{{sfn|Wenger|1991|pp=16–17}}

==Geology==
Although the area's first Spanish explorers named the feature ''Mesa Verde'', the term is a misnomer, as true mesas are almost perfectly flat. Because Mesa Verde is slanted to the south, the proper geological term is [[cuesta]], not mesa. The park is made up of several smaller cuestas located between canyons. Mesa Verde's slant contributed to the formation of the alcoves that have preserved the area's cliff dwellings.{{sfn|National Park Service (h)}}

In the late Cretaceous Period, the [[Mancos Shale]] was deposited on top of the [[Dakota Sandstone]], which is the rock formation that can be found under much of Colorado. The beds of the Mancos Shale are "fine-grained sand-stones, mudstones, and shales" which accumulated in the deep water of the Cretaceous Sea. It has a high clay content which causes it to expand when wet leading to sliding of the terrain. On top of this shale, there are three formations in the Mesaverde group which reflect the changes in depositional environment in the area over time. The first is the [[Point Lookout Sandstone]], which is named for the Point Lookout feature in the park (elevation 8427 feet). This sandstone, which formed in the marine environment of shallow water when the Cretaceous sea was receding, is "massive, fine-grained, cross-bedded, and very resistant", in its layers reflecting waves and currents that were present during the time of its formation. Its sediments are approximately 400 feet thick, and its upper layers feature fossiliferous invertebrates.{{sfn|Harris|Tuttle|Tuttle|2004|pp=91–102}}

Next is the Menefee Formation, the middle formation whose content features interbedded carbonaceous shales, siltstones, and sandstones. These were deposited in semi-marine environments of brackish water, such as swamps and lagoons. Due to its depositional environment and the organic material in its composition, there are thin coal seams running through the Menefee Formation. At the top, this formation is intruded upon by the Cliff House Sandstone.{{sfn|Harris|Tuttle|Tuttle|2004|pp=91–102}}

The Cliff House Sandstone is the area's youngest rock layer. It was formed after the Cretaceous sea had completely receded and as a result has a high sand content from beaches, dunes, etc. and from this receives its characteristic yellow tint to its canyon faces. Like the Point Lookout Sandstone, it is about 400 feet thick. It contains numerous fossil beds of different types of shells, fish teeth, and other invertebrate leftovers from the receded sea. The shale zones in this feature determine where alcoves formed where the Ancestral Puebloans constructed their dwellings.{{sfn|Harris|Tuttle|Tuttle|2004|pp=91–102}}

Continuing through the Cretaceous period and into the early [[Tertiary]], there was uplifting in the area of the Colorado Plateau, the San Juan Mountains, and the [[La Plata Mountains]], which led to the formation of the Mesa Verde pediment with the help of erosion. Small channels of water ran across this formation depositing gravel. Later in the tertiary, the last period of uplift and rock tilting towards the south caused these streams to cut rapidly into the rock removing loose sediment and forming the vast canyons seen today. This caused the isolation of the Mesa Verde pediment from surrounding rock. Today, since the climate is more arid, these erosional processes are slowed.{{sfn|Harris|Tuttle|Tuttle|2004|pp=91–102}}

==Rediscovery==
[[File:SpruceTreeHouse.JPG|left|thumb|Spruce Tree House]]
Mexican-Spanish missionaries and explorers [[Dominguez–Escalante Expedition|Francisco Atanasio Domínguez and Silvestre Vélez de Escalante]], seeking a route from [[Santa Fe, New Mexico|Santa Fe]] to California, faithfully recorded their travels in 1776. They reached Mesa Verde (''green plateau'') region, which they named after its high, tree-covered [[plateaus]], but they never got close enough, or into the needed angle, to see the ancient stone villages.{{sfn|Wenger|1991|p=77}}{{sfn|Watson|1961|pp=9–10}}  They were the first white men{{opinion|date=October 2018}} to travel the route through much of the [[Colorado Plateau]] into Utah and back through Arizona to New Mexico.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Treimer|first=Katieri|title=Site Research Report, Site Number 916, Southwest Colorado|year=1989|work=Earth Metrics and SRI International, for Contel Systems and the United States Air Force}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Mesa Verde region has long been occupied by the Utes, and an 1868 treaty between them and the United States government recognized Ute ownership of all Colorado land west of the Continental Divide. After there had become an interest in land in western Colorado, a new treaty in 1873 left the Ute with a strip of land in southwestern Colorado between the border with New Mexico and 15 miles north.  Most of Mesa Verde lies within this strip of land. The Ute wintered in the warm, deep canyons and found sanctuary there and the high plateaus of Mesa Verde. Believing the cliff dwellings to be sacred ancestral sites, they did not live in the ancient dwellings.{{sfn|Wenger|1991|p=77}}

Occasional trappers and prospectors visited, with one prospector, John Moss, making his observations known in 1873.{{sfn|Reynolds|Reynolds|2006|p=}} The following year, Moss led eminent photographer [[William Henry Jackson]] through Mancos Canyon, at the base of Mesa Verde. There, Jackson both photographed and publicized a typical stone cliff dwelling.{{sfn|Reynolds|Reynolds|2006|p=}} Geologist [[William H. Holmes]] retraced Jackson's route in 1875.{{sfn|Reynolds|Reynolds|2006|p=}} Reports by both Jackson and Holmes were included in the 1876 report of the [[Ferdinand Vandeveer Hayden|Hayden Survey]], one of the four federally financed efforts to explore the American West. These and other publications led to proposals to systematically study Southwestern archaeological sites.{{sfn|Reynolds|Reynolds|2006|p=}}

In her quest to find Ancestral Puebloan settlements, [[Virginia Donaghe McClurg|Virginia McClurg,]] a journalist for the ''[[New York Daily Graphic]]'', visited Mesa Verde in 1882 and 1885. Her party rediscovered Echo Cliff House, Three Tier House, and Balcony House in 1885; these discoveries inspired her to protect the dwellings and artifacts.{{sfn|Wenger|1991|pp=9–13, 24}}{{sfn|Robertson|2003|pp=61–72}}

===Wetherills===
A family of cattle ranchers, the Wetherills, befriended members of the Ute tribe near their ranch southwest of [[Mancos, Colorado]].  With the Ute tribe's approval, the Wetherills were allowed to bring cattle into the lower, warmer plateaus of the present [[Ute Mountain Ute Tribe|Ute reservation]] during winter. Word of the Ancestral Puebloan great houses had spread, and Acowitz, a member of the Ute tribe, told the Wetherills of a special cliff dwelling in Mesa Verde: "Deep in that canyon and near its head are many houses of the old people&amp;nbsp;– the Ancient Ones.  One of those houses, high, high in the rocks, is bigger than all the others.  Utes never go there, it is a sacred place."{{sfn|Wenger|1991|p=79}}{{sfn|Watson|1961|pp=133–37}} On December 18, 1888, [[Richard Wetherill]] and cowboy Charlie Mason rediscovered Cliff Palace after spotting the ruins from the top of Mesa Verde. Wetherill gave the ruin its present-day name. Richard Wetherill, family and friends explored the ruins and gathered artifacts, some of which they sold to the [[Historical Society of Colorado]] and much of which they kept.{{sfn|Wenger|1991|pp=79–80}}{{sfn|Watson|1961|pp=133–37}} Among the people who stayed with the Wetherills and explored the cliff dwellings was mountaineer, photographer, and author [[Frederick H. Chapin]], who visited the region during 1889 and 1890. He described the landscape and ruins in an 1890 article and later in an 1892 book, ''The Land of the Cliff-Dwellers'', which he illustrated with hand-drawn maps and personal photographs.{{sfn|Robertson|2003|pp=61–72}}

The Wetherills also hosted [[Gustaf Nordenskiöld]], the son of polar explorer [[Adolf Erik Nordenskiöld]], in 1891.{{sfn|Wenger|1991|p=81}}{{sfn|Watson|1961|p=27}} Nordenskiöld was a trained mineralogist who introduced scientific methods to artifact collection, recorded locations, photographed extensively, diagrammed sites, and correlated what he observed with existing archaeological literature as well as the home-grown expertise of the Wetherills.{{sfn|Fitzgerald|2009|p=W12}} He removed a lot of artifacts and sent them to Sweden, where they eventually went to the [[National Museum of Finland]].  Nordenskiöld published, in 1893, ''The Cliff Dwellers of the Mesa Verde''.{{sfn|Wenger|1991|pp=82–84}} When Nordenskiöld shipped the collection that he made of Mesa Verde artifacts, the event initiated concerns about the need to protect Mesa Verde land and its resources.{{sfn|Wenger|1991|pp=83–84}}

==National Park==
[[File:Mesa Verde park map.png|thumb|left|alt=A color map of Mesa Verde park map by the National Park Service|Park map]]
In 1889, Goodman Point Pueblo became the first pre-Columbian archaeological site in the Mesa Verde region to gain federal protection. It was the first such site to be protected in the US.{{sfn|Varien|2006|p=39}} Virginia McClurg was diligent in her efforts between 1887 and 1906 to inform the United States and European community of the importance of protecting the important historical material and dwellings in Mesa Verde.&lt;ref name="rancourt"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rancourt|first1=Linda M|title=Cultural Celebration|journal=National Parks|date=Winter 2006|volume=80|issue=1|page=4|url=http://web.b.ebscohost.com/ehost/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?vid=5&amp;sid=f32a47e1-3ed2-48f6-9779-dd2e7f8bc049%40sessionmgr102|accessdate=8 July 2017|issn=0276-8186|postscript={{subscription needed|via=[https://www.ebsco.com EBSCO]'s Master File Complete}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her efforts included enlisting support from 250,000 women through the Federation of Women's Clubs, writing and having published poems in popular magazines, giving speeches domestically and internationally, and forming the Colorado Cliff Dwellers Association.  The Colorado Cliff Dwellers' purpose was to protect the resources of Colorado cliff dwellings, reclaiming as much of the original artifacts as possible and sharing information about the people who dwelt there.  A fellow activist for protection of Mesa Verde and prehistoric archaeological sites included [[Lucy Evelyn Peabody|Lucy Peabody]], who, located in Washington, D.C., met with members of Congress to further the cause.{{sfn|Fitzgerald|2009|p=W12}}{{sfn|Wenger|1991|p=85}}{{sfn|Robertson|2003|pp=61–72}} Former Mesa Verde National Park superintendent Robert Heyder communicated his belief that the park might have been far more significant with the hundreds of artifacts taken by Nordenskiöld.{{sfn|Webb|Boyer|Turner|2010|p=302}}
[[File:J Walter Fewkes.jpg|thumb|Jesse Walter Fewkes at Mesa Verde cliff dwellings, {{circa|1910}}]]
[[File:Mesa Verde National Park (1917).jpg|thumb|right|Mesa Verde National Park, 1917]]

By the end of the 19th century, it was clear that Mesa Verde needed protection from people in general who came to Mesa Verde and created or sold their own collection of artifacts. In a report to the [[United States Secretary of the Interior|Secretary of the Interior]], [[Smithsonian Institution]] Ethnologist [[Jesse Walter Fewkes]] described vandalism at Mesa Verde's Cliff Palace:
{{Quote|Parties of "curio seekers" camped on the ruin for several winters, and it is reported that many hundred specimens there have been carried down the mesa and sold to private individuals. Some of these objects are now in museums, but many are forever lost to science. In order to secure this valuable archaeological material, walls were broken down&amp;nbsp;... often simply to let light into the darker rooms; floors were invariably opened and buried kivas mutilated. To facilitate this work and get rid of the dust, great openings were broken through the five walls which form the front of the ruin. Beams were used for firewood to so great an extent that not a single roof now remains. This work of destruction, added to that resulting from erosion due to rain, left Cliff Palace in a sad condition.&lt;ref&gt;[[United States Department of the Interior]], pp. 486-487, 503.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Many artifacts from Mesa Verde are now located in museums and private collections in the US and across the world. A representative selection of pottery vessels and other objects, for example, is now in the [[British Museum]] in London.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/search.aspx?place=2065&amp;plaA=2065-3-1|title=British Museum - Collection Mesa Verde|work=British Museum}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1906, President [[Theodore Roosevelt]] approved creation of the Mesa Verde National Park and the [[Antiquities Act|Federal Antiquities Act of 1906]].{{sfn|Wenger|1991|pp=84–85}} The park was an effort to "preserve the works of man" and was the first park created to protect a location of cultural significance.&lt;ref name="rancourt" /&gt; The park was named with the Spanish term for ''green table'' because of its forests of [[juniper]] and [[Pinyon pine|piñon]] trees.{{sfn|National Park Service (a)}}

===Excavation and protection===
Between 1908 and 1922, Spruce Tree House, Cliff Palace, and Sun Temple ruins were stabilised.{{sfn|Casey|1993|p=221}} Most of the early efforts were led by [[Jesse Walter Fewkes]].{{sfn|National Park Service (d)}} During the 1930s and 40s, [[Civilian Conservation Corps]] workers, starting in 1932, played key roles in excavation efforts, building trails and roads, creating museum exhibits and constructing buildings at Mesa Verde.{{sfn|National Park Service (d)}} From 1958 to 1965, Wetherill Mesa Archaeological Project included archaeological excavations, stabilization of sites, and surveys. With excavation and study of eleven Wetherill Mesa sites, it is considered the largest archaeological effort in the US.{{sfn|National Park Service (d)}} The project oversaw the excavation of Long House and Mug House.{{sfn|Nordby|2006|p=111}}

In 1966, as with all historical areas administered by the [[National Park Service]], Mesa Verde was listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]], and in 1987, the [[Mesa Verde Administrative District]] was listed on the register.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|work=National Register of Historic Places|title=Montezuma County, Colorado|url=http://www.nationalregisterofhistoricplaces.com/co/Montezuma/districts.html|accessdate=August 7, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was designated a [[World Heritage Site]] in 1978.{{sfn|National Park Service (d)}} In its 2015 travel awards, [[Sunset (magazine)|''Sunset'']] magazine named Mesa Verde National Park "the best cultural attraction" in the Western United States.{{sfn|Harden|2015}}

=== Conflicts with Local Tribes ===
Clashes between non-Indigenous environmentalists and local tribes surrounding the ruins at Mesa Verde began even before the park's official establishment. Conflicts over who laid claim to the land surrounding the ruins came to fruition in 1911, when the US government wanted to secure more land for the park that was owned by the Ute Indians. The Utes were reluctant to agree to the land swap proposed by the government, noting that the land they were seeking was the best land the tribe owned. Frederick Abbott, working with Indian Office official James McLaughlin, proclaimed to be an ally to the Ute in negotiations. Abbott later claimed that the "government was stronger than the Utes," saying that when the government finds "old ruins on land that it wants to take for public purposes, it has the right to take it..." Feeling they were left with no other options, the Utes reluctantly agreed to trade the 10,000 acres on Chapin Mesa for 19,500 acres on Ute Mountain.

The Utes continued to battle the Bureau of Indian Affairs to prevent more Ute land from being incorporated into the park. In 1935, the BIA attempted to gain back some the land traded in 1911. Additionally, superintendent Jesse Nusbaum later confessed that the Ute Mountain land traded for Chapin Mesa in 1911 belonged to the tribe anyway, meaning the government had traded land that never belonged to them in the first place.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=American Indians &amp; National Parks|last=Keller|first=Robert|last2=Turek|first2=Michael|publisher=The University of Arizona Press|year=1998|isbn=0816513724|location=Tucson|pages=30–42}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other issues unrelated to land disputes emerged as a result of park activities. In the 1920s, the park began offering "Indian ceremony" performances that gained popularity among visiting tourists; however, the ceremonies did not actually reflect the rites of the Ancient Puebloans that lived in the cliff dwellings nor the rites of the modern Ute. Navajo day laborers performed these rituals, resulting in "the wrong Indians doing the wrong dance on...the wrong land." In addition to the inaccuracy of the ceremonies, a question of whether Navajo dancers were paid fairly also resulted in questions regarding the lack of local American Indians being employed in other capacities in the park. Additionally, the park offered little financial benefits to the Ute Mountain Ute despite their land swap making much of the park possible.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Indian Country, God's Country: Native Americans and the National Parks|last=Burnham|first=Philip|publisher=Island Press|year=2000|isbn=155963667X|location=Washington, D.C.|pages=62–66}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Wildfire damage at Mesa Verde by RO.JPG|thumb|right|alt=A color picture of some burned trees|Wildfire damage on Chapin Mesa]]
During the years 1996 to 2003, the park suffered from several [[wildfire]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nps.gov/meve/parkmgmt/upload/fire_history_09.pdf ''Mesa Verde Fire History''.] Mesa Verde National Park Retrieved September 24, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; The fires, many of which were started by lightning during times of drought, burned {{convert|28340|acres}} of forest, more than half the park. The fires also damaged many archaeological sites and park buildings. They were named: Chapin V (1996), Bircher and Pony (2000), Long Mesa (2002), and the Balcony House Complex fires (2003), which were five fires that began on the same day. The Chapin V and Pony fires destroyed two rock art sites, and the Long Mesa fire nearly destroyed the museum&amp;nbsp;– the first one ever built in the National Park System&amp;nbsp;– and Spruce Tree House, the third largest cliff dwelling in the park.{{sfn|Bell|2006|p=119}}

Prior to the fires of 1996 to 2003, archaeologists had surveyed approximately ninety percent of the park. Dense undergrowth and tree cover kept many ancient sites hidden from view, but after the Chapin V, Bircher and Pony fires, 593 previously undiscovered sites were revealed&amp;nbsp;– most of them date to the Basketmaker III and Pueblo I periods. Also uncovered during the fires were extensive water containment features, including 1,189 check dams, 344 terraces, and five reservoirs that date to the Pueblo II and III periods.{{sfn|Bell|2006|pp=120–21}} In February 2008, the [[Colorado Historical Society]] decided to invest a part of its $7&amp;nbsp;million budget into a [[culturally modified trees]] project in the National Park.&lt;ref&gt;''State Historical Fund awards more than $7M in grants'', Denver Business Journal, Feb 14, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ute Mountain Tribal Park===
{{main|Ute Mountain Tribal Park}}
The [[Ute Mountain Tribal Park]], adjoining Mesa Verde National Park to the east of the mountains, is approximately {{convert|125000|acre}} along the [[Mancos River]].  Hundreds of surface sites, cliff dwellings, petroglyphs, and wall paintings of Ancestral Puebloan and [[Ute people|Ute]] cultures are preserved in the park.  Native American Ute tour guides provide background information about the people, culture, and history of the park lands. ''National Geographic Traveler'' chose it as one of "80 World Destinations for Travel in the 21st Century", one of only nine places selected in the US.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mesaverdecountry.com/tourism/archaeology/utemtn.html ''Ute Mountain Tribal Park.''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110717000555/http://www.mesaverdecountry.com/tourism/archaeology/utemtn.html |date=July 17, 2011 }} Ute Mountain Tribal Park Retrieved June 18, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

==Key sites==
In addition to the cliff dwellings, Mesa Verde boasts a number of mesa-top ruins.{{sfn|Casey|1993|pp=220–21}} Examples open to public access include the Far View Complex and Cedar Tree Tower on Chapin Mesa, and Badger House Community, on Wetherill Mesa.{{sfn|Casey|1993|p=222}}

===Balcony House===
[[File:Boy in doorway MVNP.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|Emmett Harryson, a Navajo, at a T-shaped doorway at Balcony House (1929)]]
Balcony House is set on a high ledge facing east. Its 45 rooms and 2 kivas would have been cold during the winter. Visitors on ranger-guided tours enter by climbing a 32-foot ladder and a crawling through a 12-foot tunnel.  The exit, a series of toe-holds in a cleft of the cliff, was believed to be the only entry and exit route for the cliff dwellers, which made the small village easy to defend and secure.  One log was dated at 1278, so it was likely built not long before the Mesa Verde people migrated out of the area.{{sfn|Casey|1993|pp=225–26}}{{sfn|Wenger|1991|pp=55–56}} It was officially excavated in 1910 by Jesse Nusbaum, one of the first Superintendents of Mesa Verde National Park.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mesa Verde Balcony House|url=http://www.visitmesaverde.com/discover/points-of-interest/cliff-dwellings/balcony-house.aspx|publisher=Aramark: Parks and Destinations|accessdate=October 23, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Visitors can enter Balcony House through ranger-guided tours.{{sfn|National Park Service (b)}}

===Cliff Palace===
{{main|Cliff Palace}}
[[File:Cliff Palace at Mesa Verde.jpg|thumb|left]]
This multi-storied ruin, the best-known cliff dwelling in Mesa Verde, is located in the largest alcove in the center of the Great Mesa. It was south- and southwest-facing, providing greater warmth from the sun in the winter. Dating back more than 700 years, the dwelling is constructed of sandstone, wooden beams, and mortar.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.visitmesaverde.com/discover/points-of-interest/cliff-dwellings/cliff-palace.aspx ''Cliff House''] Visit Mesa Verde Retrieved October 16, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the rooms were brightly painted.{{sfn|Wenger|1991|p=51}}{{sfn|Watson|1961|pp=3, 29, 31, 37}} Cliff Palace was home to approximately 125 people, but was likely an important part of a larger community of sixty nearby pueblos, which housed a combined six hundred or more people. With 23 kivas and 150 rooms, Cliff Palace is the largest cliff dwelling in Mesa Verde National Park.{{sfn|Varien|2006|p=41}}

===Long House===
[[File:Long House cliff dwellings at Mesa Verde, 2006May23.jpg|thumb]]
Located on the Wetherill Mesa, Long House is the second-largest Mesa Verdean village; approximately 150 people lived there. The location was excavated from 1959 through 1961, as part of the Wetherhill Mesa Archaeological Project.{{sfn|National Park Service (c)}} Long House was built {{circa|1200}}; it was occupied until 1280. The cliff dwelling features 150 rooms, a kiva, a tower, and a central plaza.{{sfn|Glowacki|Neff|Glascock|1998|p=220}} Its rooms are not clustered like typical cliff dwellings. Stones were used without shaping for fit and stability. Two overhead ledges contain storage space for grain. One ledge seems to include an overlook with small holes in the wall to see the rest of the village below. A spring is accessible within several hundred feet, and seeps are located in the rear of the village.{{sfn|Wenger|1991|p=57}}

===Mug, Oak Tree, Spruce Tree, and Square Tower houses===
Mug House is located on Wetherill Mesa; it contains 94 rooms, a large kiva, and a nearby reservoir. It received its name from four mugs the Charles Mason and the Wetherill brothers found strung together at the site.{{sfn|Wenger|1991|p=59}} Oak Tree House and neighboring Fire Temple can be visited via a 2-hour ranger-guided hike.{{sfn|National Park Service (g)}} Spruce Tree House is the third-largest village, within several hundred feet of a spring, and had 130 rooms and eight kivas. It was constructed sometime between 1211 and 1278. It is believed anywhere from 60 to 80 people lived there at one time.{{sfn|National Park Service (e)}} Because of its protective location, it is well preserved.{{sfn|Wenger|1991|p=52}}{{sfn|National Park Service (e)}} The short trail to Spruce Tree House begins at the Chapin Mesa Archeological Museum.{{sfn|National Park Service (f)}} The Square Tower House is one of the stops on the Mesa Top Loop Road driving tour.{{sfn|National Park Service (f)}} The tower is the tallest structure in Mesa Verde.{{sfn|Noel|2015|p=36}}

'''Opus Anglicanum''' or '''English work''' is fine [[needlework]] of [[Medieval England]] done for ecclesiastical or secular use on [[clothing]], hangings or other [[textiles]], often using gold and silver threads on rich velvet or linen grounds. Such English embroidery was in great demand across Europe, particularly from the late 12th to mid-14th centuries and was a luxury product often used for diplomatic gifts.

==Uses==
Most of the surviving examples of Opus Anglicanum were designed for liturgical use.  These exquisite and expensive [[embroidery]] pieces were often made as [[vestment]]s, such as [[cope]]s, [[chasuble]]s and [[orphrey]]s, or else as [[antependium|antependia]], shrine covers or other church furnishings. Secular examples, now known mostly just from contemporary inventories, included various types of garments, horse-trappings, book covers and decorative hangings.

==Manufacture==
Opus Anglicanum was usually [[embroidery|embroidered]] on [[linen]] or, later,  [[velvet]], in [[Backstitch|split stitch]] and [[couching (embroidery)|couching]] with [[silk]] and [[gold]] or [[goldwork (embroidery)|silver-gilt thread]].&lt;ref&gt;Levey, S. M. and D. King, ''The Victoria and Albert Museum's Textile Collection Vol. 3: Embroidery in Britain from 1200 to 1750'', Victoria and Albert Museum, 1993, {{ISBN|1-85177-126-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gold-wound thread, pearls and jewels are all mentioned in inventory descriptions.
Although often associated with nunneries, by the time of [[Henry III of England|Henry III]] (reg. 1216–72), who purchased a number of items for use within his own court and for [[diplomatic gift|diplomatic gifting]], the bulk of production was in lay workshops, mainly centred on London. The names of various (male) embroiderers of the period appear in the [[Pipe Rolls|Westminster royal accounts]].&lt;ref&gt;Article: Opus Anglicanum, ''Grove Dictionary of Art'', Oxford, 1996&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reputation==
[[File:Butlerbowden cope.jpg|thumb|right|500px|[[The Butler-Bowden Cope]], 1330–50, V&amp;A Museum]]

English needlework had become famous across Europe during the [[History of Anglo-Saxon England|Anglo-Saxon]] period (though very few examples survive) and remained so throughout the Gothic era.  A Vatican inventory of 1295  lists over 113 pieces from England, more than from any other country;&lt;ref&gt;Remnant 1964:111; Bonnie Young, "Opus Anglicanum" ''The Metropolitan Museum of Art Bulletin'', New Series, '''29'''.7 (March 1971:291–298) p. 291; the article was occasioned by an exhibition at The Cloisters.&lt;/ref&gt; a request by [[Pope Innocent IV]], who had envied the gold-embroidered [[cope]]s and mitres of English priests, that Cistercian religious houses send more is reported  by the Benedictine [[chronicle]]r [[Matthew Paris]] of [[St Albans]]: "This command of my Lord Pope did not displease the London merchants who traded in these embroideries and sold them at their own price."&lt;ref&gt;Quoted Young 1971:291.&lt;/ref&gt; The high water mark of style and refinement is normally considered to have been reached in the work of the 13th and early 14th centuries. An influential exhibition at the [[Victoria and Albert Museum]] from September–November 1963 displayed several examples of Opus Anglicanum from this period alongside contemporary works of wood and stone sculpture, metalwork and ivories.&lt;ref&gt;King, David (ed), ''Opus Anglicanum'' (exhibition catalogue), London, V&amp;A Press, 1963.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==
Survival rates for Opus Anglicanum are low (especially for secular works) as is clear from comparing the large number listed in contemporary inventories with the handful of examples still existing. Sometimes ecclesiastical garments were later modified for different uses, such as altar coverings or book covers. Others were buried with their owners, as with the vestments of the mid-13th century Bishops, [[Walter de Cantilupe]] and [[William de Blois (bishop of Worcester)|William de Blois]], fragments of which were recovered when their tombs in [[Worcester Cathedral]] were opened in the 18th century. The majority however were lost to neglect, destroyed by [[iconoclasm|iconoclasts]] or else unpicked or burnt to recover the precious metals from the gold and silver threads.
Although fragmentary examples can be found in a number of museums, the most important specialised collections of Opus Anglicanum garments are at the [[Cloisters Museum]] in New York, the [[Victoria and Albert Museum]] in London and in the Treasury of [[Sens Cathedral]].

Only a few [[Anglo-Saxon art|Anglo-Saxon]] pieces have survived, including three pieces at [[Durham, England|Durham]] that had been placed in the coffin of [[St Cuthbert]], probably in the 930s, after being given by [[King Athelstan]]; they were however made in [[Winchester]] between 909 and 916. These are works "of breathtaking brilliance and quality", according to Wilson, including figures of saints, and important early examples of the Winchester style, though the origin of their style is a puzzle; they are closest to a wall-painting fragment from Winchester, and an early example of [[acanthus (ornament)|acanthus]] decoration.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, 154–156, quote 155; Dodwell (1993), 26; Golden Age, 19, 44, though neither these nor any textiles could be lent for the exhibition.&lt;/ref&gt;  The earliest group of survivals, now re-arranged and with the precious metal thread mostly picked out, are bands or borders from vestments, incorporating pearls and glass beads, with various types of scroll and animal decoration. These are probably 9th century and now in a church in [[Maaseik]] in Belgium.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, 108; Dodwell (1993), 27, who gives details of further fragments.&lt;/ref&gt;  A further style of textile is a vestment illustrated in a miniature portrait of [[Saint Aethelwold]] in [[Benedictional of St. Æthelwold|his Benedictional]], which shows the edge of what appears to be a huge acanthus "flower" (a term used in several documentary records) covering the wearer's back and shoulders.  Other written sources mention other large-scale compositions.&lt;ref&gt;Dodwell (1982), 183–185; [http://img49.imageshack.us/img49/5295/benedictional1am1.jpg portrait of Saint Aethelwold]&lt;/ref&gt;

One particularly fine example is ''The Adoration of the Magi'' [[chasuble]] from c.&amp;nbsp;1325 in red velvet embroidered in gold thread and pearls at the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] in New York.  It depicts a [[Nativity of Jesus in art|nativity]] scene with emphasis on decorative motifs, flowers, animals, birds, beasts, and angels.  [[The Butler-Bowden Cope]] at the Victoria and Albert Museum is another surviving example; the same collection has a late cope made for a set of vestments given by [[Henry VII of England|Henry VII]] to [[Westminster Abbey]].

The '''Pasadena Boys Choir''' is one of the oldest civic boy choirs in the United States, founded in 1925 by Dr. John Henry Lyons.

==History==

Founded in 1925 by Dr. John Henry Lyons as an adjunct of the Pasadena school system, The '''Pasadena Boys Choir''' survives today as one of the oldest civic boy choirs in the United States. In 1971, the Choir was reorganized by its current Director, John Barron, as a private, non-profit educational institution. Today the Choir is composed of boys between the ages of 8 and 13 from all ethnic and socio-economic backgrounds who attend public, private and parochial schools throughout the greater San Gabriel and San Fernando Valleys. Since 1971, over 2,000 boys have been members of the Choir.

The organization’s admission policy is strictly non-discriminatory and non-denominational and any boy who meets the 8-to-13 age requirement is welcome to apply. All members attend their own schools and the initial time commitment on a boy’s part is two two- to three-hour classes each week, after school and on Sundays.

Over the years, the Choir has received numerous awards and commendations. Endorsements have come from the California Parent Teachers Association, the State Superintendent of Schools, and the California State Legislature in Sacramento.

'''Training Program'''

Boys that enter the Pasadena Boys Choir program are initially assigned to a Beginner’s Class for at least one semester.  There they begin a comprehensive training program which will eventually prepare them for public performance.  The Boys receive professional instruction in music theory, vocal production, ear training, stage deportment and public speaking.   Included in this initial introduction are classical, patriotic, folk, songs from musicals and contemporary pop music.

After successfully completing the beginner’s program, boys advance to the next level of training and are moved to the main performance group.  The boys are expected to remain for a full term of training through their eighth grade school year or age 13.

'''Performances'''

During a typical season from September to June, the Choir may be called upon to perform in a number of varied concert and entertainment venues.  Among these are weddings, banquets, conventions and seasonal programs.  In addition, occasional calls are received from movie, television and other production companies in the Southern California area.

'''Summer Camp'''

The choir operates during the normal school year with the exception of a two-week summer camp session during the last week of July and the first week of August.

'''Tax Status'''

The Pasadena Boys Choir is a registered nonprofit organization.

[http://ipsnews.net/news.asp?idnews=42235 ECUADOR New Constitution Addresses Demand for ‘Plurinational’ State], ipsnews.net&lt;/ref&gt;  In plurinationalism, the idea of [[nationality]] is plural, meaning there are many [[Nation|national]]s within an organized community or body of peoples.  Derived from this concept, a '''plurinational state''' is the existence of multiple political communities and constitutional asymmetry.  The usage of plurinationality assists in avoiding the division of societies within a state or country.  Furthermore, a '''plurinational democracy''' recognizes the multiple [[Glossary of rhetorical terms#D|demoi]] (common people or populace)&lt;ref name=FD&gt;[http://www.thefreedictionary.com/Demoi demos], thefreedictionary.com&lt;/ref&gt; within a polity.&lt;ref name=Pluri&gt;Keating, Michael.

==Plurinational state==
A plurinational state is formed by political and administrative [[decentralization]], wherein the administrative system is culturally [[heterogeneous]] and allows the participation of all the social sectors and groups.  The elements of a plurinational state include being [[plural]], redistributive, [[antibureaucratic]], and a [[democracy]] that defends [[solidarity]].  It also has the following additional characteristics: decentralization, [[autonomy]], [[sustainability]], [[Social equality|equality]], and [[multiculturalism|diversity]].&lt;ref name=CONAIE&gt;[http://conaie.nativeweb.org/assembly/assembly4.html The Plurinational State], CONAIE&lt;/ref&gt;

Popular Unity was founded on 21 August 2015 by twenty five parliamentarians formerly affiliated to the [[Syriza|Coalition of the Radical Left]] (Syriza),{{r|bbc21aug}} as a reaction to [[Prime Minister of Greece|Prime Minister]] [[Alexis Tsipras]]' handling of the [[Greek government-debt crisis|Greek bailout agreement of 2015]]. It is led by the former [[Ministry of Productive Reconstruction, Environment and Energy|Minister of Energy]] [[Panagiotis Lafazanis]].{{r|nytimes}} Due to receiving 2.86% (vs. the required 3%) of the popular vote in the September 2015 election it has no seats in the Parliament.{{r|reporter}}

==History==
Popular Unity was founded on 21 August 2015 by 25 parliamentarians formerly affiliated to the [[Syriza|Coalition of the Radical Left]] (Syriza),{{r|bbc21aug}} as a reaction to [[Prime Minister of Greece|Prime Minister]] [[Alexis Tsipras]]' handling of the [[Greek government-debt crisis|Greek bailout agreement of 2015]]. At foundation Popular Unity was the third largest party in the [[Hellenic Parliament|Greek parliament]].{{r|"Kouvelakis"}} It is led by the former [[Ministry of Productive Reconstruction, Environment and Energy|Minister of Energy]] in the [[First Cabinet of Alexis Tsipras|Tsipras cabinet]], [[Panagiotis Lafazanis]].{{r|nytimes}} [[Dimitris Stratoulis]] (former [[Ministry of Labour and Social Solidarity (Greece)#Ministers of Labour and Social Solidarity (since 2015)|Alternate Minister of Social Security]]) and [[Costas Isychos]] (former Alternate Minister of National Defence), who were sacked in July 2015,{{r|ekathimerini}} also joined the new party.

===Election September 2015===
On 2 September 2015, the party programme for the [[Greek legislative election, September 2015|snap election on September 20]] was published.{{r|program}} The party received about 2.9% of the vote, below the 3% threshold to win any seats in parliament. In response to the result the party said, 'we lost the game but not the war'.{{r|reporter}}

==Naming==
The name of the party is inspired by [[Popular Unity (Chile)|Popular Unity]], the [[Chile]]an political alliance led by [[Salvador Allende]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.jamaicaobserver.com/latestnews/Greece-rebels-form-new-party-ahead-of-snap-polls|title=Greece rebels form new party ahead of snap polls|date=21 August 2015|agency=AFP|accessdate=21 August 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150822184939/http://www.jamaicaobserver.com/latestnews/Greece-rebels-form-new-party-ahead-of-snap-polls|archivedate=22 August 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Policies==
The party favours [[Greek withdrawal from the eurozone|Greek withdrawal]] from the [[eurozone]] and reinstating the [[Greek drachma|drachma]] as Greece's national currency.{{r|bbc21aug}} According to founding member Stathis Kouvelakis, a former member of Syriza's Central Committee, the new party supports [[socialist internationalism]], [[pacifism]], Greece's exit from [[NATO]], and breaking military agreements with [[Israel]].&lt;ref name="Kouvelakis"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="26926">'''Prosodic bootstrapping''' (also known as '''phonological bootstrapping''') in [[linguistics]] refers to the hypothesis that learners of a primary language [[First language|(L1]]) use [[Prosody (linguistics)|prosodic features]] such as [[Pitch accent|pitch]], [[Speech tempo|tempo]], [[Rhythm (linguistics)|rhythm]], amplitude, and other auditory aspects from the speech signal as a cue to identify other properties of grammar, such as [[syntactic structure]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Child Language: Acquisition and Growth|last=Lust|first=Barbara|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2006|isbn=978-0-521-44922-9|location=Cambridge, United Kingdom|pages=290|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Acoustically signaled [[prosodic unit]]s in the stream of [[speech]] may provide critical perceptual cues by which infants initially discover [[Generative grammar|syntactic phrases]] in their language.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Although these features by themselves are not enough to help infants learn the entire syntax of their native language, they provide various cues about different grammatical properties of the language, such as identifying the ordering of [[Head (linguistics)|heads]] and [[Complement (linguistics)|complements]] in the language using [[Stress (linguistics)|stress]] prominence,&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Christophe|first=Anne|last2=Nespor|first2=Marina|last3=Guasti|first3=Maria|last4=Ooyen|first4=Brit|year=2003|title=Prosodic structure and syntactic acquisition: the case of the head-direction parameter|journal=Developmental Science|volume=6|pages=211–220|doi=10.1111/1467-7687.00273}}&lt;/ref&gt; indicating the location of [[Phrase (linguistics)|phrase boundaries]], and word boundaries.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Christophe|first=Anne|last2=Guasti|first2=Teresa|last3=Nespor|first3=Marina|last4=Dupoux|first4=Emmanuel|last5=Ooyen|first5=Brit V.|year=1997|title=Reflections on Phonological Bootstrapping: Its Role for Lexical and Syntactic Acquisition|journal=Language and Cognitive Prosesses|volume=12|pages=585–612|doi=10.1080/016909697386637}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is argued that [[Prosody (linguistics)|prosody]] of a language plays an initial role in the [[Language acquisition|acquisition of the first language]] helping children to uncover the syntax of the language, mainly due to the fact that children are sensitive to [[Prosody (linguistics)|prosodic]] cues at a very young age.&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Christophe|first=Anne|last2=Mehler|first2=Jacques|last3=Sebastían-Gallés|first3=Núria|year=2001|title=Perception of Prosodic boundary Correlates by Newborn Infants|journal=Infancy|volume=2|pages=385–394|doi=10.1207/s15327078in0203_6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Argument for ==
The argument for prosodic bootstrapping was first introduced by Gleitman and Wanner (1982), who observed that infants might use prosodic cues (particularly acoustic cues) to discover underlying [[Grammar|grammatical information]] about their native language.  These cues (e.g [[Intonation (linguistics)|intonation]] contour in a question phrase, lengthening a final segment)&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; could aid infants in dividing the speech input into different lexical units, and furthermore aid in placing these units into syntactic phrases appropriate to the language.&lt;ref name=":16"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Höhle|first=Barbara|year=2009|title=Bootstrapping mechanisms in first language acquisition|url=http://www.uni-potsdam.de/fileadmin/projects/babylab/assets/Hoehle_2009.pdf|journal=Linguistics|volume=47|pages=359–382|doi=10.1515/ling.2009.013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prosodic bootstrapping may also provide an explanation to the problem as to how infants segment continuous input.  Just like adult speakers, children are exposed to continuous speech. Hearing continuous speech poses a problem for children learning their native language because pauses in speech do not align with word boundaries. As a result, children have to construct word representations from the speech that they hear.&lt;ref name=":62"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Christophe|first=Anne|last2=Dupoux|first2=Emmanuel|last3=Bertoncini|first3=Josiane|last4=Mehler|first4=Jacques|date=1994-03-01|title=Do infants perceive word boundaries? An empirical study of the bootstrapping of lexical acquisition|url=http://scitation.aip.org/content/asa/journal/jasa/95/3/10.1121/1.408544|journal=The Journal of the Acoustical Society of America|volume=95|issue=3|pages=1570–1580|doi=10.1121/1.408544|issn=0001-4966}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A study conducted by Christophe et al (1994) showed that infants, aging three-days old, are sensitive to acoustic properties of a language. It was shown that three-day olds are able to discriminate bisyllabic stimuli with the same segments based on whether they were extracted from within a word or across a word boundary. The duration of the word initial consonant and the word final vowel are the cues for the existence of a word boundary, which infants may use to learn about [[Syntax|syntactic structure]].&lt;ref name=":62"/&gt;

Another main support for the prosodic bootstrapping hypothesis is that the use of prosodic elements to segment parts of speech can occur at a very early age, as early as 3 days,&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; where infants have shown the ability to differentiate languages based on phonological characteristics alone, and the fact that the use of prosodic cues occurs before the use of lexical or syntactic data.  This has led to hypothesis of "bootstrapping from the signal"/"prosodic bootstrapping", which has three main elements:&lt;ref name=":17"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Soderstrom|first=Melanie|last2=Seidl|first2=Amanda|last3=Kemler Nelson|first3=Deborah|last4=Jusczyk|first4=Peter|year=2003|title=The prosodic bootstrapping of phrases: Evidence from prelinguistic infants|url=|journal=Journal of Memory and Language|volume=49|pages=249–267|via=|doi=10.1016/s0749-596x(03)00024-x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

# Infants can detect and are sensitive to these acoustic properties.    
# These acoustic properties can be used by infants when processing speech.

== Phonological phrases ==
A phonological phrase boundary indicates how the continuous speech stream is broken up into smaller units, which infants use to pick out and more closely identify individual parts of the sentence.&lt;ref name=":15"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gout|first=Ariel|last2=Christophe|first2=Anne|last3=Morgan|first3=James L.|orig-year=2004|title=Phonological phrase boundaries constrain lexical data access II.  Infant data|journal=Journal of Memory and Language|volume=51|pages=548–567|doi=10.1016/j.jml.2004.07.002}}&lt;/ref&gt; A phonological phrase can contain between four to seven syllables, and can be detected by infants, due to the fact that the edges of the phrases are either strengthened or lengthened.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Various studies have been done to test if prosody helps with acquisition of syntax, morphology, and phonology.&lt;ref name=":62"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":72"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jusczyk|first=P.

Another acoustic cue that indicates a prosodic boundary is the duration of a pause.  These pauses will usually be longer in duration at the edge of a word boundary, when referring to clause boundaries.&lt;ref name=":17" /&gt; For example, the two sentences below, while seemingly similar on the surface representation, have different prosodic structure, which correlates to the different syntactic structure ("..." = longer duration of pause in speech):     
# "The boy met the girl at the teach in" → [The boy]&lt;sub&gt;NP&lt;/sub&gt; ... [met the girl]&lt;sub&gt;VP&lt;/sub&gt; ... [at the teach in]&lt;sub&gt;PP&lt;/sub&gt;     
# "The boy met the girl and the teacher" → [The boy]&lt;sub&gt;NP&lt;/sub&gt; ... [met the girl and the teacher]&lt;sub&gt;VP&lt;/sub&gt;     
Using different durations of pause, the underlying syntactic structure can be better distinguished by the listener.

=== Acquiring lexicon ===

For infants who are learning their native language, it is difficult to extract words from speech waves because pronounced words are not separated by silence. There are several proposals for lexical acquisition. The first is that children hear words in isolation: if a new piece goes between two words that are known, the new piece must be a new word. The second proposal is that there are some cues in the speech that give signal to the presence of a word boundary: duration, [[Pitch accent|pitch]], energy.&lt;ref name=":62"/&gt;

The fact that speech is presented in a continuous stream without pause only makes the task of acquiring a language more difficult for infants.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Christophe|first=Anne|last2=Dupoux|first2=Emmanuel|year=1996|title=Bootstrapping lexical acquisition: The role of prosodic structure|journal=The Linguistic Review|volume=13|pages=383–412|doi=10.1515/tlir.1996.13.3-4.383}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been proposed that prosodic features such as the strength of certain sounds, relative to their location in the word, can be used to break apart and identify fragments within the speech stream, in order to differentiate between potentially ambiguous sentences.&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mattys|first=Sven L.|last2=Jusczyk|first2=Peter W.|year=2001|title=Do Infants Segment Words or Recurring Contiguous Patterns|journal=Journal of Experimental Psychology|volume=27|pages=644–655|doi=10.1037/0096-1523.27.3.644}}&lt;/ref&gt; In English for example, the final [d] in the word "bold" tends to be "weak", in that it is not fully released.  On the other hand, an initial [d] in a word such as "dime" is more clearly released, opposed to its word-final counterpart.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; This difference in strong v. weak sounds may help to better identify where the sound occurs in the word, whether at the beginning or the end.

Studies have shown that phonological boundaries can be interpreted as word boundaries, which further aids the child in the task of developing a lexicon.&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt; For example, Millotte et al (2010) tested 16-month olds, observing how children use phonological phrase boundaries to constrain lexical access. When infants heard a prosodic boundary, they were able to detect the existence of a word boundary. In the experiments authors used the conditioned head-turn procedure which showed that when infants were trained to turn their heads for a bisyllabic word, they responded to sentences that contained this word more often than to those that contained both syllables of this word, but separated by a phonological phrase boundary.&lt;ref name=":83"/&gt;

Because prosodic boundaries will never occur inside of a word, thus infants will not be constrained in how they identify words in the speech signal.  For example, children can differentiate between words such as "'''dice'''" and "re'''d ice'''", even though both are [[Phonology|phonologically]] similar.  This is because a prosodic boundary will not appear in the middle of the word *(d][ice) but around the word instead ([dice]).&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt;

Children use phonological phrase boundaries to constrain lexical access. They infer the existence of a word boundary given a prosodic boundary. If two sequences differ in prosody while being made up of identical segments (pay per vs. paper), children treat them as different sequences. Studies that measured cues from prosody to phonological phrases have been done in a variety of languages that differ from each other, providing support that phonological phrases could possibly aid in acquiring lexicon universally.&lt;ref name=":83" /&gt;

=== Acquiring syntax ===

In addition to helping to identify lexical items, a key element of prosodic bootstrapping involves using prosodic cues to identify syntactic knowledge about the language.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Christophe|first=Anne|last2=Millotte|first2=Séverine|last3=Bernal|first3=Savita|last4=Lidz|first4=Jeffrey|year=2008|title=Bootstrapping Lexical and Syntactic Acquisition|journal=Language and Speech|volume=51|pages=61–75|doi=10.1177/00238309080510010501}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because prosodic phrase boundaries are correlated to syntactic boundaries, listeners can determine the syntactic category of a word, using only prosodic boundary information.  Christophe et al. (2008) demonstrated that adults could use prosodic phrases to determine the syntactic category of ambiguous words.  Listeners were provided two sentences with an ambiguous word [mɔʀ], which could either belong to a verb category ("mord", translated as "it bites") or a noun category ("mort", translated as the adjective "dead").&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;
{| class="wikitable"

|[le petit chien] ['''mord'''...]
|[the little dog] ['''bites'''...]
|-
|Noun (adjective)
|[le petit chien '''mort'''...]
|[the little '''dead''' dog...]
|}

The table above depicts the two sentences heard by French-speaking adults in Christophe et al. (2008), where the emboldened word is the phonetically ambiguous word, and the brackets represent phonological phrase boundaries.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Using the position of the prosodic boundaries, adults were able to determine which category the ambiguous word [mɔʀ] belonged to, since the word is assigned to a different phonological phrase, depending on its syntactic category and semantic meaning in the sentence.

An important tool for acquiring syntax is the use of [[function word]]s (e.g. [[Article (grammar)|articles]], verb morphemes, [[Preposition and postposition|prepositions]]) to point out [[Constituent (linguistics)|syntactic constituent]] boundaries.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; These function words frequently occur in language, and generally appear at the borders of [[prosodic unit]]s.  Because of their high frequency in the input, and the fact that they tend to have only one to two syllables, infants are able to pick out these function words when they occur at the edges of a prosodic unit. In turn, the function words can help learners determine the [[syntactic category]] of the neighboring words (e.g., learning that the word "the" [ðə] introduces a noun phrase, and that suffixes such as "-ed" require a verb to precede it).&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;  For example, in the sentence "The turtle is eating a pigeon", through the use of function words such as "the" and the [[auxiliary verb]] "is", children can get better sense as to where prosodic boundaries fall, resulting in a division such as [The turtle][is eating][a pigeon], where brackets indicate a boundary.  As a result, infants tend to look out for these words to better identify the beginnings and ends of the prosodic units.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;  Noun articles like "the" or "a", in English for example, can only be followed by noun, since they are the only words that can fit this category;  one would never hear a sentence such as "The *destroy was widespread".  Likewise, the use of verb morphemes (e.g past tense "-ed" [d]/[t], continuous "-ing" [iŋ], auxiliary "is" [ɪz]) indicate that a verb must precede it, and indicate that no other word can fill the category besides a verb (e.g. *"I saw that he *happyed yesterday").

In a study by Carvalho et al (2016), experimenters tested preschool children, where they showed that by the age of 4 prosody is used in real time to determine what kind of syntactic structure sentences could have. The children in the experiments were able to determine the target word as a noun when it was in a sentence with a prosodic structure typical for a noun and as a verb when it was in a sentence with a prosodic structure typical for a verb. Children by the age of 4 use phrasal prosody to determine the syntactic structure of different sentences.&lt;ref name=":92"/&gt;

== Linguistic rhythm ==

=== Stress ===

[[Isochrony|Rhythm]] is an important aspect of prosody in terms of [[Isochrony|syllable timing]] and emphasis, and varies from language to language.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ramus|first=Franck|last2=Nespor|first2=Marina|last3=Mehler|first3=Jacques|year=1999|title=Correlates of linguistic rhythm in the speech signal|journal=Cognition|volume=73|pages=265–292|doi=10.1016/s0010-0277(99)00058-x}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Languages are grouped into different categories based on their rhythm, primarily in stress based, rhythm (syllable) based, and [[Mora (linguistics)|mora]] based categories.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mazuka|first=Reiko|orig-year=2007|title=The Rhythm-based Prosodic Bootstrapping Hypothesis of Early Language Acquisition: Does It Work for Learning for All Languages?|journal=Gengo Kenkyu|volume=132|pages=1–13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Infants around 6 months of age have shown to be able to differentiate between different languages solely on the basis of these particular stress differences.  More specifically, infants by 2 months of age can from vague categories of different rhythmic structures, those that are native classes, and those that are nonnative.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Before reaching 2 months, infants can distinguish between languages of any class, but by the age of 2 months can only put languages in the native or nonnative class.  For example, English speaking infants will have a hard time differentiating between English and Dutch (since both are stress based languages), but will be able to distinguish Russian (a stress based language) and Japanese (a mora based language).&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; By 2 months however, an English speaking baby will group syllable-timed and mora-timed languages into one "nonnative" group, and thus will have a hard time differentiating languages such as French (syllable-timed) and Japanese (mora-timed).&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  This stress variance is also a useful tool for bilingual infants, and acts as a strong indicator when differentiating between different languages being learned.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bosch|first=Laura|last2=Sebastián-Gallés|first2=Núria|year=1997|title=Native-language recognition abilities in 4-month-old infants from monolingual and bilingual environments|journal=Cognition|volume=65|pages=33–69|doi=10.1016/s0010-0277(97)00040-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Detecting head direction ===

The question of whether the [[Head-directionality parameter|head direction parameter]] can be detected using prosodic cues has been tested with French babies listening to Turkish sentences,&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; in order to determine whether or not 6 to 12 weeks old babies are sensitive to prosodic prominence in speech. Setting the head direction parameter allows infants to acquire a hierarchal branching structure for a particular language, which determines whether the language is left-headed (right-branching) or right-headed (left-branching).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  This particular experiment (Christophe et al. 2003) had 6- to 12-week-old babies listening to modified "nonsense" (the modified French and modified Turkish sentences in the table below) sentences that were neither French nor Turkish, but only differed in the fact that the Turkish based sentences were [[Head-directionality parameter|head final]] and French based sentenced were [[Head-directionality parameter|head initial]].  The reasoning behind this is that infants might be able detect  prominence within these phonological phrases, as prominence has been shown to follow a systematic pattern with languages; head-initial languages have prominence on the right (French), while head-final languages have prominence on the left (Turkish).&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

These nonsense sentences were created in order to eliminate any non-prosodic interference (e.g phonological differences, different number of syllables, etc.) thus babies would only be able to differentiate between the two languages based on the prominence of prosodic cues in the sentences.

As predicted, French babies tended to prefer the modified nonsense French phrases, based solely on prosodic prominence, given by the location of the head direction parameter.

Jusczyk et al (1992) tested 9 month-olds, where they showed that infants are sensitive to acoustic correlates of main phrasal units that are present in the prosody of English sentences. The prosodic markers in the input are longer durations of the syllable that precedes a main phrasal boundary and declinations in fundamental frequency.&lt;ref name=":72"/&gt;

== Computational modeling ==
Several language models have been used to show that in a computational simulation, prosody can help children acquire syntax.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pate|first=John K.|last2=Goldwater|first2=Sharon|date=2011-01-01|title=Unsupervised Syntactic Chunking with Acoustic Cues: Computational Models for Prosodic Bootstrapping|url=http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2021096.2021099|journal=Proceedings of the 2Nd Workshop on Cognitive Modeling and Computational Linguistics|series=CMCL '11|location=Stroudsburg, PA, USA|publisher=Association for Computational Linguistics|pages=20–29|isbn=9781932432954}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In one study, Gutman et al (2015) build a computational model that used prosodic structure and function words to jointly determine the syntactic categories of words.  The model assigned syntactic labels to prosodic phrases with success, using phrasal prosody to determine the boundaries of phrases, and function words at the edges for classification. The study presented the model of how early syntax acquisition is possible with the help of prosody: children access phrasal prosody and pay attention to words placed at the edges of prosodic boundaries. The idea behind the computational implementation is that prosodic boundaries signal syntactic boundaries and function words that are used to label the prosodic phrases. As an example, a sentence "She's eating a cherry" has a prosodic structure such as [She's eating] [a cherry] where the skeleton of a syntactic structure is [VN NP] (VN is for verbal nucleus where a phrase contains a verb and adjacent words such as auxiliaries and subject pronouns). Here, children may utilize their knowledge of function words and prosodic boundaries in order to create an approximation of syntactic structure.&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gutman|first=Ariel|last2=Dautriche|first2=Isabelle|last3=Crabbé|first3=Benoît|last4=Christophe|first4=Anne|date=2015-07-03|title=Bootstrapping the Syntactic Bootstrapper: Probabilistic Labeling of Prosodic Phrases|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10489223.2014.971956|journal=Language Acquisition|volume=22|issue=3|pages=285–309|doi=10.1080/10489223.2014.971956|issn=1048-9223}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a study by Pate et al (2011), where a computational language model was presented, it was shown that acoustic cues can be helpful for determining syntactic structure when they are used with lexical information. Combining acoustic cues with lexical cues may usefully provide children with initial information about the place of syntactic phrases which supports the prosodic bootstrapping hypothesis.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;

== Criticism ==
A key criticism of the bootstrapping theory in general is that these mechanisms (whether they be syntactic, semantic, or prosodic) serve mainly as a starting point for learning the language.&lt;ref name=":16" /&gt; That is, the bootstrapping mechanisms are only useful up to a certain point in linguistic development for infants, and thus there might be some other mechanism that might be used later on, since the bootstrapping mechanisms primarily use information that is not controlled for "cross-linguistic variation" (information that varies from language to language).&lt;ref name=":16" /&gt;

Regarding prosodic bootstrapping in particular, there is speculation on how accurately prosodic phrases map to syntactic structure.&lt;ref name=":16" /&gt; That is, phrases with identical syntactic structure can have different possible prosodic structures.  In the sentence "The cat chased the rat that ate the cheese.", the prosodic structure would resemble:

[The cat] [chased the rat] [that ate the cheese]

However, the prosodic unit [chased the rat] in this case is not a syntactic constituent, demonstrating that not every prosodic unit is a syntactic unit.  Rather, one can observe that a language may not always provide [[Injective function|one-to-one mapping]] from prosodic information to linguistic units. Prosody does not give children direct and systematic information from prosodic structure to linguistic structure.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Jusczyk (1997) argued that most people who accept this theory assume that children are drawing on "a range of information available in the speech signal that extends beyond prosody",&lt;ref name=":14"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.amazon.com/Discovery-Language-Communication-Jusczyk-1997-01-10/dp/B01A0BVD18|title=The Discovery of Spoken Language|last=Jusczyk|first=Peter W.|date=1997-01-10|publisher=A Bradford Book}}&lt;/ref&gt; further explaining that relying on prosodic information alone is not enough to learn the structure of the language.

{{for|the song by Silversun Pickups|The Royal We}}
{{Refimprove|date=May 2011}}

The '''royal ''we''''', or '''majestic plural''' ({{lang|la|pluralis maiestatis}}), is the use of a [[plural]] [[pronoun]] (or corresponding plural-inflected verb forms) to refer to a single person who is a [[monarch]]. The more general word for the use of a ''we'', ''us'', or ''our'' to refer to oneself is ''[[nosism]]''.

Speakers employing the royal we refer to themselves using a [[grammatical number]] other than the singular (i.e., in plural or [[Dual (grammatical number)|dual]] form). For example, in his manifesto confirming the abdication of Grand Duke Constantine Pavlovich, Emperor [[Alexander I of Russia|Alexander I]] begins: "By the Grace of God, We, Alexander I, Emperor and Autocrat of All the Russias ....".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.imperialhouse.ru/en/dynastyhistory/dinzak3/1097.html|title=Russian Imperial House - Manifesto of Emperor Alexander I, Confirming the Abdication of Tsesarevich and Grand Duke Constantine Pavlovich and Designating Grand Duke Nicholas Pavlovich as Heir, 16 August 1823|author=|date=|website=www.imperialhouse.ru}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Western usage ==
It is commonly employed by a person of high office, such as a monarch, earl, or [[pope]]. It is also used in certain formal contexts by [[bishop]]s and university [[Rector (academia)|rectors]]. [[William Longchamp]] is credited with its introduction to England in the late 12th century, following the practice of the [[Chancery of Apostolic Briefs]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Longchamp, William de (''d''. 1197) |url= http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/16980 |last=Turner |first=Ralph V. |work=Oxford Dictionary of National Biography |publisher=Oxford University Press |date=May 2007 |doi= 10.1093/ref:odnb/16980 |accessdate=12 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the public situations in which it is used, the monarch or other dignitary is typically speaking not only in his or her personal capacity but also in an official capacity as leader of a nation or institution. In the grammar of several languages, plural forms tend to be perceived as deferential and more polite than singular forms. This grammatical feature is common in languages that have the [[T-V distinction]].  English used to have this feature but lost it over time, largely by the end of the 17th century.&lt;ref name="UofAriz"&gt;{{cite web|title=Politeness in Early Modern English: the second person pronouns|url=http://www2.nau.edu/~eng121-c/politenessin%20AME.htm|website=Northern Arizona University|publisher=Arizona Board of Regents|accessdate=22 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In diplomatic letters, such as [[Letter of credence|letters of credence]], it is customary for monarchs to use the singular first-person (''[[I (pronoun)|I]]'', ''me'', ''my'') when writing to other monarchs, while the majestic plural is used in royal letters to a president of a republic.&lt;ref name="satow1932"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Satow|first1=Ernest Mason|title=A Guide to Diplomatic Practice|date=1932|publisher=Longmans|location=London|page=37|quote=In these letters the plural "We" and "Our" are employed instead of "I" and "My," and the letters terminate thus: "Your Good Friend." This form is used mainly for Royal letters to Presidents of Republics.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Commonwealth realms]], the sovereign discharges his/her [[Commission (document)#Examples of military and naval commissions|commissions to ranked military officers]] in the capacity of ''we''.  Many official documents published in the name of the monarch are also presented with royal ''we'', such as [[letters patent]], [[proclamation]], etc.

Popes have historically used the ''we'' as part of their formal speech, for example as used in ''[[Notre charge apostolique]]'', ''[[Mit brennender Sorge]]'', and ''[[Non abbiamo bisogno]]''.  
Since [[Pope John Paul II]], however, the royal ''we'' has been dropped by popes in public speech, although formal documents may have retained it.  Recent papal documents dispensed with the majestic plural in the original Latin are given with the singular ''I'' in their official English translations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/john_paul_ii/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-04-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110430185550/http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/john_paul_ii/ |archivedate=30 April 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{full|date=November 2012}}

In 1989, [[Margaret Thatcher]], then [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom]], was met with disdain by some in the press for using the royal ''we'' when announcing news that she had become a grandmother.&lt;ref&gt;''The Phrase Finder''. [http://www.phrases.org.uk/meanings/401700.html "We are a grandmother"].&lt;/ref&gt;

== Non-Western usage ==
Several prominent [[Names of God in Judaism|epithets]] of the [[Tanakh|Bible]] describe the [[Jewish God]] in plural terms: ''[[Elohim]]'', ''[[Adonai]]'', and ''[[El Shaddai]]''. Many Christian scholars, including the post-apostolic leaders and  [[Augustine of Hippo]], have seen the use of the plural and grammatically singular verb forms as support for the doctrine of the [[Trinity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=On the Trinity |url=http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/1301.htm |publisher=New Advent |accessdate=7 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest use of this poetic device is somewhere in the 4th century AD, during the Byzantine period. Therefore, none of the authors of the books of the Bible understood the unusual grammar as a "royal we".

In the Quran, God sometimes refers to Himself as "We". Muslim exegits and theologians teach that this is specifically when referring to His great power and majesty. They understood it similar to modern Rabbinical understanding of the majestic plural. 

In [[Imperial China]] and every monarchy within its [[East Asian cultural sphere|cultural orbit]] (including [[Japanese Empire|Japan]], [[Korean Empire|Korea]], and [[Vietnamese Empire|Vietnam]]), the majestic imperial pronoun was expressed by the [[Chinese character|character]] ''zhèn'' ({{lang|zh|{{linktext|朕}}}}) ([[Old Chinese]]: ''*lrəmʔ''). This was in fact the former Chinese first-person {{em|singular}} pronoun (that is, 'I'). However, following his [[Qin's wars of unification|unification of China]], the [[List of rulers of China|emperor]] [[Shi Huangdi]] arrogated it entirely for his personal use. All other speakers and writers were obliged to choose some [[Chinese honorifics|deferential epithet]] (such as ''yú'' ({{lang|zh|愚}}), 'this foolish one') instead of using the former pronoun. While this practice did not affect the non-Chinese countries as much since their variants of ''zhèn'' ({{lang|zh|朕}}) were generally imported loanwords, it nevertheless led to a polite avoidance of pronouns throughout East Asia. {{Crossreference|(For more information, see: [[Japanese pronouns]], [[Korean pronouns]], and [[Vietnamese pronouns]])}}. This still persists, except in [[China]], following the [[May Fourth Movement]] and the [[Chinese Communist Party|Communist Party]] victory in the [[Chinese Civil War]]. In [[Modern Standard Mandarin]], the first-person singular is ''wǒ'' ({{lang|zh|{{linktext|我}}}}), which gradually emerged from a common epithet expressing 'this [worthless] body'.&lt;ref&gt;''ZDic'', {{lang|zh|《漢典》}} [''Chinese Dictionary'']. [http://www.zdic.net/z/1a/js/6211.htm "我"]. Accessed 22 August 2013. {{zh icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{contradict inline|wikt:我#Etymology|date=September 2018}}. {{Crossreference|(See also [[Chinese Pronouns]].)}} 

In [[Hindustani language|Hindustani]] and other [[Indo-Aryan languages]], the majestic plural is a common way for elder speakers to refer to themselves when addressing those younger than them, and also for persons of higher social rank or [[Indian caste system|caste]] to refer to themselves when speaking to those of a perceived inferior rank or caste. In certain communities, the singular plural (मैं, 'I') may be dispensed with altogether for self-reference, and the plural [[nosism]] used uniformly while speaking to a social inferior or superior.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Snell|Weightman|1989|p=106}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition and Redressal) Act, 2013''' is a  [[legislative act]] in [[India]] that seeks to protect women from [[sexual harassment]] at their place of work. It was passed by the [[Lok Sabha]] (the lower house of the [[Indian Parliament]]) on 3 September 2012. It was passed by the [[Rajya Sabha]] (the upper house of the Indian Parliament) on 26 February 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title="The Sexual Harassment Bill undermines the innovative spirit of Vishaka" – Naina Kapur, Lawyer and Equality Consultant|url=http://barandbench.com/brief/4/3251/the-sexual-harassment-bill-undermines-the-innovative-spirit-of-vishaka-naina-kapur-lawyer-and-equality-consultant-|accessdate=2 March 2013|newspaper=Bar and Bench|date=1 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Bill got the assent of the President on 23 April 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace  (Prevention, Prohibition and Redressal) Act, 2013 Published in The Gazette of India|url=http://pib.nic.in/newsite/erelease.aspx?relid=95069|publisher=Press Information Bureau|accessdate=26 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Act came into force from 9 December 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Law against sexual harassment at workplace comes into effect|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/Law-against-sexual-harassment-at-workplace-comes-into-effect/articleshow/27308194.cms|accessdate=14 December 2013|newspaper=Times of India}}&lt;/ref&gt; This statute superseded the [[Vishakha Guidelines]] for prevention of sexual harassment introduced by the Supreme Court of India.

==Preamble and background==
The introductory text of the Act is:

&lt;blockquote&gt;''An Act to provide protection against sexual harassment of women at workplace and for the prevention and redressal of complaints of sexual harassment and for matters connected therewith or incidental thereto.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;WHEREAS sexual harassment results in violation of the fundamental rights of a woman to equality under articles 14 and 15 of the Constitution of India and her right to life and to live with dignity under article 21 of the Constitution and right to practice any profession or to carry on any occupation, trade or business which includes a right to a safe environment free from sexual harassment;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;AND WHEREAS the protection against sexual harassment and the right to work with dignity are universally recognised human rights by international conventions and instruments such as Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of Discrimination against Women, which has been ratified on the 25th June, 1993 by the Government of India;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;AND WHEREAS it is expedient to make provisions for giving effect to the said Convention for protection of women against sexual harassment at workplace.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition and Redressal) Act, 2013|url=http://www.prsindia.org/uploads/media/Sexual%20Harassment/Sexual%20harrassment%20bill%20As%20passed%20by%20Lok%20Sabha.pdf|publisher=PRS Legislative Research|accessdate=26 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Background and provisions==
{{See also|Eveteasing|Sexism in India}}
According to the [[Press Information Bureau]] of the [[Government of India]]:
&lt;blockquote&gt;The Act will ensure that women are protected against sexual harassment at all the work places, be it in public or private. This will contribute to realisation of their right to gender equality, life and liberty and equality in working conditions everywhere. The sense of security at the workplace will improve women's participation in work, resulting in their economic empowerment and inclusive growth.&lt;ref&gt;Press Information Bureau, Government of India (4 November 2010). [http://pib.nic.in/newsite/erelease.aspx?relid=66781%7C Protection of Women against Sexual Harassment at Workplace Bill, 2010]. Retrieved 13 September 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Act uses a definition of sexual harassment which was laid down by the [[Supreme Court of India]] in Vishaka v. State of [[Rajasthan]] (1997).&lt;ref name = "ToI1"&gt;Chakrabarty, Rakhi (4 September 2012) [http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2012-09-04/india/33581408_1_internal-complaints-committee-physical-contact-and-advances-sexually-coloured-remarks "Sexual harassment at workplace Bill passed"]. ''[[Times of India]]''. Retrieved 13 September 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Article 19 (1) g of the Indian Constitution affirms the right of all citizens to be employed in any profession of their choosing or to practice their own trade or business. Vishaka v. State of Rajasthan established that actions resulting in a violation of one's rights to ‘Gender Equality’ and ‘Life and Liberty’ are in fact a violation of the victim’s fundamental right under Article 19 (1) g. The case ruling establishes that sexual harassment violates a woman's rights in the workplace and is thus not just a matter of personal injury.&lt;ref&gt;Lawyer's Collective, [http://www.lawyerscollective.org/blog/sexual-harassment-women-workplace-bill-2012-passed-lok-sabha.html Sexual harassment of women at workplace bill 2012 passed by Lok Sabha], 6 September 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; This case ruling had issued Vishaka guidelines under Article 32 of the Constitution of India. The Supreme Court had made it mandatory that these had to be followed by all originations until a legislative framework on the subject has been drawn-up and enacted. &lt;ref name="legalfront.in"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legalfront.in/legal-updates/2018/07/how-to-be-posh-compliant-are-you-compliant-with-sexual-harassment-of-women-at-workplace-prevention-prohibition-and-redressal-act-2013/|title=HOW TO BE POSH COMPLIANT? - Legal Front|date=2 July 2018|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the legislative void continued and the Supreme Court in Apparel Export Promotion Council v. A.K Chopra ((1999) 1 SCC 759) reiterated the law laid down in the Vishaka Judgment. Dr. Medha Kotwal of Aalochana (an NGO) highlighted a number of individual cases of sexual harassment stating that the Vishaka Guidelines were not being effectively implemented. Converting the letter into a writ petition, the Supreme Court took cognizance and undertook monitoring of implementation of the Vishaka Guidelines across the country. The Supreme Court asserted that in case of a non-compliance or non-adherence of the Vishaka Guidelines, it would be open to the aggrieved persons to approach the respective High Courts. &lt;ref name="legalfront.in"/&gt;

The legislative progress of the Act has been a lengthy one. The Bill was first introduced by women and child development minister [[Krishna Tirath]] in 2007 and approved by the [[Union Cabinet]] in January 2010. It was [[Table (parliamentary procedure)|tabled]] in the Lok Sabha in December 2010 and referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Human Resources Development. The committee's report was published on 30 November 2011.&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Telegraph (Calcutta)|The Telegraph]]'' (Calcutta) (18 April 2012).

==Major Features==
* The Act defines sexual harassment at the work place and creates a mechanism for redressal of complaints.  It also provides safeguards against false or malicious charges.&lt;ref name="legalfront.in"/&gt;
* The Act also covers concepts of 'quid pro quo harassment' and '[[hostile work environment]]' as forms of sexual harassment if it occurs in connection with an act or behaviour of sexual harassment.&lt;ref&gt;Handbook on the Law of Sexual Harassment at Workplace by Shivangi Prasad and Attreyi Mukherjee, available at amazon.in and bigbookshop.com&lt;/ref&gt; 
* The definition of "aggrieved woman", who will get protection under the Act is extremely wide to cover all women, irrespective of her age or employment status, whether in the organised or unorganised sectors, public or private and covers clients, customers and domestic workers as well. &lt;ref name="legalfront.in"/&gt;
* An employer has been defined as any person who is responsible for management, supervision, and control of the workplace and includes persons who formulate and administer policies of such an organisation under Section 2(g). &lt;ref name="legalfront.in"/&gt;
* While the "workplace" in the [[Vishaka Guidelines]] is confined to the traditional office set-up where there is a clear employer-employee relationship, the Act goes much further to include organisations, department, office, branch unit etc. in the public and private sector, organized and unorganized, hospitals, nursing homes, educational institutions, sports institutes, stadiums, sports complex and any place visited by the employee during the course of employment including the transportation. Even non-traditional workplaces which involve tele-commuting will get covered under this law.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| title=Is your " workplace" covered under the new sexual harassment law?|url=http://blog.ipleaders.in/is-your-workplace-covered-under-the-new-sexual-harassment-law/|accessdate=4 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref name="legalfront.in"/&gt;
* The Committee is required to complete the inquiry within a time period of 90 days. On completion of the inquiry, the report will be sent to the employer or the District Officer, as the case may be, they are mandated to take action on the report within 60 days. &lt;ref name="legalfront.in"/&gt;
* Every employer is required to constitute an Internal Complaints Committee at each office or branch with 10 or more employees.  The District Officer is required to constitute a Local Complaints Committee at each district, and if required at the block level. 
* The Complaints Committees have the powers of civil courts for gathering evidence.
* The Complaints Committees are required to provide for conciliation before initiating an inquiry, if requested by the complainant.
* The inquiry process under the Act should be confidential and the Act lays down a penalty of Rs 5000 on the person who has breached confidentiality.
* The Act requires employers to conduct education and sensitisation programmes and develop policies against sexual harassment, among other obligations. 
* Penalties have been prescribed for employers.  Non-compliance with the provisions of the Act shall be punishable with a fine of up to {{INR}} 50,000.  Repeated violations may lead to higher penalties and cancellation of licence or registration to conduct business.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Protection of Women Against Sexual Harassment at Work Place Bill, 2010|url=http://www.prsindia.org/billtrack/the-protection-of-women-against-sexual-harassment-at-work-place-bill-2010-1402/|publisher=PRS Legislative Research|accessdate=19 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Government can order an officer to inspect workplace and records related to sexual harassment in any organisation.
* Under the Act, which also covers students in schools and colleges as well as patients in hospitals, employers and local authorities will have to set up grievance committees to investigate all complaints. Employers who fail to comply will be punished with a fine of up to 50,000 [[Indian rupee|rupees]].

==Penal Code==
{{Main|Criminal Law (Amendment) Act, 2013}}
Through the [[Criminal Law (Amendment) Act, 2013]], Section 354 was added to the [[Indian Penal Code]] that stipulates what consists of a sexual harassment offence and what the penalties shall be for a man committing such an offence. Penalties range from one to three years imprisonment and/or a fine. Additionally, with sexual harassment being a crime, employers are obligated to report offences.&lt;ref name="lexology"&gt;Nishith Desai Associates, Veena Gopalakrishnan, Ajay Singh Solanki and Vikram Shroff, [http://www.lexology.com/library/detail.aspx?g=cb74f2ac-f7c5-44f8-b607-aea2f735cef4 India’s new labour law - prevention of sexual harassment at the workplace], Lexology, 30 April 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
[[Brinda Karat]], serving in the Rajya Sabha as a [[Communist Party of India (Marxist)]] member for [[West Bengal]] initially complained that the Bill does not cover women in the armed forces and excludes women agricultural workers, "a gross injustice to agricultural workers who are the single largest female component of work force in the country."&lt;ref name = "ToI1" /&gt; However, the final bill includes the clause "No woman shall be subjected to sexual harassment at any workplace" (clause 3.1), and is considered to have addressed those concerns.&lt;ref&gt;The Hindu [http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/parliament-passes-bill-to-prevent-sexual-harassment-at-workplace/article4455795.ece Parliament passes Bill to prevent sexual harassment at workplace] 26 February 2013&lt;/ref&gt; In the May 2012 draft Bill, the burden of proof is on the women who complain of harassment. If found guilty of making a false complaint or giving false evidence, she could be prosecuted, which has raised concerns about women being even more afraid of reporting offences.&lt;ref name="lexology"/&gt; Before seeing the final version of the bill, lawyer and activist [[Vrinda Grover]] said, "I hope the Bill does not have provisions for penalizing the complainant for false complaints. This is the most under-reported crime. Such provision will deter a woman to come forward and complain."&lt;ref name = "ToI1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Shajan Perappadan, Bindu (4 September 2012). [http://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/society/article3857580.ece "Safety net at hand"]. ''[[The Hindu]]''. Retrieved 13 September 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Zakia Soman]], a women's rights campaigner at [[ActionAid]] India said that "it helps to have a law and we welcome it, but the crux will lie in its implementation once it is enacted."&lt;ref name = "IBN1"&gt;[[CNN-IBN]] (5 September 2012). [http://ibnlive.in.com/news/bill-to-make-workplace-safer-for-indian-women/288478-3.html "India moves to protect women from sexual harassment at work"]. Retrieved 13 September 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

Manoj Mitta of The Times of India complained that Bill does not protect men, saying it "is based on the premise that only female employees needed to be safeguarded."&lt;ref&gt;Manoj Mitta, [http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2012-08-16/india/33232576_1_sexual-offences-sexual-assault-gender-neutrality Indian men can be raped, not sexually harassed], Times of India, 16 August 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Nishith Desai Associates, a law group, wrote a detailed analysis that included concerns about the role of the employer in sexual harassment cases. They called out the fact that there is no stipulated liability for employers in cases of employee-to-employee harassment, something upheld in many other countries. They also viewed the provision that employers are obligated to address grievances in a timely manner at the workplace as  problematic because of potentially uncooperative employees. Furthermore, the law requires a third-party [[non-governmental organisation]] to be involved, which could make employers less comfortable in reporting grievances, due to confidentiality concerns.&lt;ref name="lexology"/&gt;

Compliance to this statute has so far been left to the vagaries of the employers and government has not taken any significant step to enforce the law so far. For example, 6 months after the law came into effect, the state in UP remained dreadful as women could not participate in the workforce due to sexual harassment.&lt;ref&gt;Vikas Dhoot, http://articles.economictimes.indiatimes.com/2014-04-11/news/49058555_1_sexual-harassment-indian-women-male-harassment Abnormally high levels of sexual harassment for women at work places in UP, Times of India, 4 April 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

Some tribunals have commented on the constitutionality of some of the provisions of the statute, especially 
section 4 and Section 7.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Trivedi|first1=Anushka|title=Sexual Harassment Law in India and Constitutional Challenges  Read more: Sexual Harassment Law in India and Constitutional Challenges - iPleaders http://blog.ipleaders.in/sexual-harassment-law-in-india-and-constitutional-challenges/#ixzz3o34ZgXqI|url=http://blog.ipleaders.in/sexual-harassment-law-in-india-and-constitutional-challenges/|website=iPleaders blog|publisher=iPleaders|accessdate=9 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Statuette of Geryon''' is a 6th century BC bronze sculpture, showing the three-headed giant [[Geryon]] dressed as an ancient Greek [[hoplite]]. It was probably discovered in [[Chiusi]] in Italy, one of the towns of the [[Etruscan dodecapolis]]. It was one of the objects and artworks left to the [[musée des beaux-arts de Lyon]] by [[Jacques-Amédée Lambert]] in 1850.

In the United States, the phrase '''testing the waters''' is used to describe someone who is exploring the feasibility of becoming a candidate for political office.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fec.gov/rad/candidates/documents/CanGuideTestWater_000.pdf |accessdate=July 2, 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150703075138/http://www.fec.gov/rad/candidates/documents/CanGuideTestWater_000.pdf |archivedate=July 3, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="huffingtonpost1"&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/03/24/campaign-finance-law-2016_n_6932834.html |title='Testing The Waters': The Unseen Significance Of A Candidate Cliche |publisher=Huffingtonpost.com |date=2015-03-24 |accessdate=2015-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Testing the waters" activities are to be paid for with candidate-permissible funds.&lt;ref name="huffingtonpost1"/&gt; Once an individual begins to campaign or decides to become a candidate, funds that were raised or spent to "test the waters" apply to the $5,000 threshold for qualifying as a candidate.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt; This is because there is a [[federal law]] that once an individual raises or spends $5,000 for a campaign, they are required to register as a [[federal candidate]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://patch.com/illinois/deerfield/nancy-rotering-accused-violating-federal-campaign-law-0 |title=Nancy Rotering Accused of Violating Federal Campaign Law By Conservative Group &amp;#124; Deerfield, IL Patch |publisher=Patch.com |date=2015-07-01 |accessdate=2015-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Once that threshold is exceeded, the individual must register with the [[Federal Election Commission]] (FEC) (candidates for the [[United States House of Representatives]]) or the [[Secretary of the Senate]] (candidates for the [[United States Senate]]), and begin to file reports (including in the first report all activity that occurred prior to reaching the $5,000 threshold).&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;

Once an individual registers as a federal candidate, election restrictions apply, including 2,700 dollars on contributions.&lt;ref name="nytimes1"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/04/us/politics/jeb-bush-taking-his-time-tests-the-legal-definition-of-candidate.html|title=Jeb Bush, Taking His Time, Tests the Legal Definition of Candidate|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=2015-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, once registered as a candidate, individuals cannot coordinate with [[political action committee]]s (PACs) or [[Super PAC]]s under [[Campaign finance in the United States|campaign finance law]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/jeb-bush-eyes-new-role-for-his-super-pac-during-2016-campaign/ |title=Jeb Bush eyes new role for his super PAC during 2016 campaign |date=April 21, 2015 |accessdate=June 15, 2015 |publisher=Cbsnews.com }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reporting on "testing the waters"==
On July 1st, it was reported that Nancy Rotering allegedly received donations for her congressional campaign in excess of $5,000 as early as January and did not officially register as a candidate with the FEC until March.

On June 18, 2015, it was reported that [[Scott Walker (politician)|Scott Walker]] had formed a "testing the waters" committee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Lovelace |first=Ryan |url=http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/scott-walker-forms-a-testing-the-waters-committee/article/2566521 |title=Scott Walker forms a 'testing the waters' committee |publisher=Washington Examiner |date=2015-06-18 |accessdate=2015-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 4, 2015, it as reported that the [[Campaign Legal Center]], a nonpartisan legal organization, filed complaints with the Federal Election Commission against Democrat [[Martin O’Malley]] and Republicans Jeb Bush, Rick Santorum and Scott Walker alleging violations of federal law “testing the waters.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/campaign/243828-republican-fec-commissioner-admittedly-blocking-complaints |title=Republican FEC commissioner admittedly blocking complaints against Republicans |publisher=TheHill |date=2015-06-04 |accessdate=2015-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 3, 2015, it was reported that as of June 3, [[Jeb Bush]] was still "testing the waters", and had not registered as a federal candidate.&lt;ref name="nytimes1"/&gt;

On April 9, 2015, it was reported that [[Rick Santorum]] set up a "testing the waters" account.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/apr/9/rick-santorum-sets-testing-waters-account-ahead-po/ |title=Rick Santorum sets up 'testing the waters' account ahead of possible 2016 W.H. bid |publisher=Washington Times |date= |accessdate=2015-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Richmond, Virginia]] is filled with many different places to visit and scenic parks to explore. One of the most popular places amongst the city is located at [[Oregon Hill]]. This place is known as the '''Hollywood Cemetery'''. The Hollywood Cemetery is home to thousands of memorials, many of which are very famous. It is located within the heart of Richmond, Virginia, the capital of the state, and was created in 1849. After the Civil War was over, the government didn’t care what happened to ex-Confederate soldiers. The [[Auburn National Cemetery]] was made for those who died during the Civil War. The only problem was the government did not want to bury the Confederates in it. As a result of this, the South created the Hollywood Cemetery to properly bury the Confederate soldiers who lost their lives during a time of war.&lt;ref&gt;Krick, Robert K. "Worthy Update For Hollywood." Civil War Times 48.3 (2009): 63. Academic Search Complete. Web. 28 Oct. 2016&lt;/ref&gt; The name of the cemetery comes from all the holly trees inside it. The name was established way before movies were being created in the famous Hollywood everyone knows today.&lt;ref&gt;Riggan, Phil. "Where Am I RVA? Black Dog in Hollywood Cemetery."Richmond Times-Dispatch. Richmond Times-Dispatch, 7 Aug. 2012. Web. 04 Nov. 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; Landscaping was a very important factor to the citizens while creating the cemetery. The people of Richmond, Virginia take care of this place all the time and still do up to this day.. The area is kept up in many different ways and is open to the public daily.

==Dimmock’s Pyramid==
	A memorial in the shape of a pyramid is dedicated to 18,000 Confederate soldiers which are buried near. It is well known as the Dimmock Pyramid. Charles Henry Dimmock created this 90-foot memorial in 1869. This structure took just about a year to complete, and many people were injured and killed during the construction. It is constructed from granite and rocks. The rocks were taken from the James River, or Bell Isle, which is located very close to the cemetery. Many people spent all day hauling rocks up the hill to create the structure. The pyramid is visible from all over Oregon Hill and is a massive structure. An abundance of visitors are attracted to this site daily because there are many stories of visitors getting hit with very cold winds. People have reported hearing soldiers crying for help when near the pyramid. Also, chills and very slight moans have also been reported while near the structure. People say that the moans and cries are from the 11,000 soldiers who are unidentified and are searching for help. These reports happen mostly around the time of dusk and dark.&lt;ref&gt;Sweeney, Gary. "The Ghosts of Richmond’s Hollywood Cemetery | The Lineup." The Lineup The Ghosts of Richmond’s Hollywood Cemetery Comments., 14 July 2016. Web. 03 Nov. 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Iron Dog==

	Not too far from Dimmock’s Pyramid is a rather unique grave. The tombstone is very small and has a dog statue standing over it (Sweeney). The statue is a cast iron Newfoundland dog which is black in color. Buried underneath the dog is a three-year-old girl by the name of Bernadine Rees. She passed away at a very young age from what was believed to be scarlet fever. Her grave is often covered with toys and flowers. Bernadine loved the dog statue her uncle owned. During the civil war, soldiers were going around collecting anything they could find to make bullets with. In hopes to save the statue, her uncle brought it down to the Hollywood Cemetery and placed it on her grave. Even during a time of war, cemeteries were respected and not used as scrap metal. If it wasn’t for her uncle, the statue would have been melted down and turned into bullets. Rees’ grave attracts many visitors because of the beautiful statue, the toys and flowers placed around the grave, and the history behind the memorial. Also, the grave is right on the corner of the road, by the famous Pyramid, making it almost impossible to miss. Visitors have reported hearing growls when getting too close to the little girl's grave. Also, some have even reported seeing the dog move. The dog continues to stand guard over her grave up to this day, and will remain there for a very long time.&lt;ref&gt;Carolinas, Strange. "The Hollywood Cemetery Black Iron Dog (Richmond, VA)." Strange Carolinas: The Travelogue Of The Offbeat., 01 Jan. 1970. Web. 04 Nov. 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

===President's Circle===
One of the better known areas of the Hollywood Cemetery is the President’s Circle. It is home to former Presidents [[John Tyler]] and [[James Monroe]]. Also, it is the burial sight to very well known Confederate leaders like [[J.E.B Stuart]] and [[Jefferson Davis]] (Sweeney). The park is located at the top of Oregon Hill and overlooks the [[James River]]. Also, many other families are buried here. This area is the most famous part of the cemetery, and is seen by almost everyone who visits (Sweeney).

'''The Tibet Center''', also known as '''''Kunkhyab Thardo Ling''''', in [[New York City]], is a center for the [[Buddhist studies|study]] of [[Tibetan Buddhism]], a [[dharma center]]. The Tibet Center was founded by Venerable [[Khyongla Rato]] Rinpoche in 1975,&lt;ref&gt;Jamyang Centre website {{cite web |url=http://www.jamyang.co.uk/index.php/multimedia/audio-teachings/teachers-k-r?showall=&amp;start=2here |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-06-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140606214313/http://www.jamyang.co.uk/index.php/multimedia/audio-teachings/teachers-k-r?showall=&amp;start=2here |archivedate=2014-06-06 |df= }} accessed 2014-6-1&lt;/ref&gt; and is currently directed by Khen Rinpoche, [[Nicholas Vreeland]], who is the abbot of [[Rato Dratsang]]. The primary teachers at The Tibet Center are Khyongla Rato Rinpoche, Geshe Nicholas Vreeland, and Anthony Spina.

The Tibet Center, in partnership with the [[Richard Gere|Gere]] Foundation, has invited and hosted the [[14th Dalai Lama]] for six teaching events in NYC since 1991. Numerous other religious teachers, both Buddhist and non-Buddhist, have taught at The Tibet Center.

As well as meeting in downtown [[Manhattan]] on a weekly basis, The Tibet Center has a retreat home in [[New Jersey]].

==Name==
The [[dharma]] name of the center is ''Kunkhyab Thardo Ling'' (translation: Land Pervaded with Seekers of Liberation), a name given to the center by the 6th [[Ling Rinpoche]], who was the 97th [[Gaden Tripa]], and like many of the previous Ling Rinpoches, was the senior tutor of the [[Dalai Lama]].

==Tibet Center teachers==
The Tibet Center has three main teachers: the founder Venerable [[Khyongla Rato]] Rinpoche, who is a Tibetan incarnate lama, Venerable Khen Rinpoche, Geshe Nicholas Vreeland, and Anthony Spina, another one of Khyongla Rinpoche's long-time students.

Over the years many other Tibetan Buddhist teachers have taught at The Tibet Center. As The Tibet Center website explains, these have included, "Venerable Kyabje Ling Rinpoche, the Senior Tutor of His Holiness the Dalai Lama, Venerable [[Tsenzhab Serkong Rinpoche|Tsenshab Serkong Rinpoche]], who served as the official debating partner of H. H. the Dalai Lama, [[Sakya Trizin]] Rinpoche, the hereditary head of the [[Sakya]] order of Tibetan Buddhism, Venerable [[Trulshik Rinpoche]] of the [[Nyingma]] tradition, and Venerable [[Tenga Rinpoche]] of the [[Kagyu]] tradition."&lt;ref&gt;The Tibet Center website, History &amp; Mission, [http://thetibetcenter.org/history/] accessed 2014-6-1&lt;/ref&gt;

Buddhist teachers from the [[Chinese Chán|Chan]], [[Theravadan]] and [[Zen]] traditions have also taught at The Tibet Center. In addition, teachers from the [[Jain]], [[Hindu]] and [[Christian]] religions, as well as scientists and philosophers, have taught there.&lt;ref name="thetibetcenter.org"&gt;The Tibet Center website, History &amp; Mission, [http://thetibetcenter.org/history/] accessed 2014-5-31&lt;/ref&gt;

===Khyongla Rato===
{{Main|Khyongla Rato}}
Khyongla Rinpoche is a Tibetan incarnate lama who was born in Tibet in 1923. He left Tibet in 1959 and has lived in New York (and subsequently in New Jersey) since 1968. Khyongla Rato has taught at the Tibet Center for almost 40 years.&lt;ref&gt;Foundation for the Preservation of the Mahayana Teachings website, Teachers, Lineage Lamas, Lama Zopa Rinpoche's Teachers, Khyongla Rato Rinpoche [http://fpmt.org/teachers/lineage-lamas/khyongla-rinpoche/] Accessed 2014-5-31&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Tillya tepe''', '''Tillia tepe''' or '''Tillā tapa''' ({{lang-fa|طلا تپه}}) or (literally "Golden Hill" or "Golden Mound") is an [[archaeology|archaeological]] site in the northern [[Afghanistan]] province of [[Jowzjan Province|Jowzjan]] near [[Sheberghan]], excavated in 1978 by a [[Soviet Union|Soviet]]-[[Reigns of Nadir Shah and Zahir Shah|Afghan]] team led by the [[Greece|Greek]]-[[Russia]]n archaeologist [[Viktor Sarianidi]], a year before the [[Soviet invasion of Afghanistan]].  The hoard is often known as the '''Bactrian gold'''.

The hoard is a collection of about 20,600 ornaments, coins and other kinds of artifacts, made of gold, silver, ivory etc.,  that were found in six burial mounds (five women and one man) with extremely rich jewelry, dated to around the 1st century BCE. The ornaments include [[necklace]]s set with semi-precious stones, [[belt (clothing)|belts]], [[medallion]]s and a [[crown (headgear)|crown]]. After its discovery, the hoard went missing during the wars in Afghanistan, until it was "rediscovered" and first brought to public attention again in 2003.  A new museum in [[Kabul]] is being planned where the Bactrian gold will eventually be kept.

The heavily fortified town of Yemshi-tepe, just five kilometres to the northeast of modern Sheberghan on the road to [[Akcha]], is only half a kilometre from the now-famous necropolis of Tillia-tepe.

==Dates and context==
[[File:TilliaTepeReconstitution.jpg|thumb|left|335px|Reconstitution of two members of the Tillya Tepe burial, with corresponding artifacts: man (r. tomb IV) and woman (l. tomb II).]]
Several coins dated up to the early 1st century CE, with none dated later, suggest a 1st-century CE date for the burial. The burial could correspond to Scythian or Parthian tribes dwelling in the area, or may correspond to the extinction of the local [[Yuezhi]] royal dynasty after the conquests of all the other ''xihou''  or 'princes' in [[Daxia]] by [[Kujula Kadphises]]. (See [[Pre-Islamic period of Afghanistan]].)

[[File:BactriaMap.jpg|thumb|175px|Tillya Tepe is located in the Western portion of the region of ancient [[Bactria]].]]
A silver coin was found in one of the tombs from the reigns of the [[Parthia]]n king [[Mithridates II of Parthia|Mithridates II]], who ruled c. 123–88 BCE. The coin was found in tomb III, and was apparently held in the hand of the defunct woman.

An imitation gold coin of Parthian King [[Gotarzes I]] (95-90 BCE) was found in the left hand of the defunct woman in tomb 6. The fact that this coin is in gold, and not silver or bronze as is usually the case for Parthian coinage, suggest that this imitation was made for prestige purposes. The coin is counterstamped with the frontal depiction of what might have been a local chieftain. The counterstamp was added so as to not damage the portrait of the Parthian king, perhaps indicating some degree of dependency on the Parthians.

A gold coin was also found in tomb III showing the bust in profile of the wreath-crowned Roman Emperor [[Tiberius]]. On the reverse is an enthroned, sumptuously draped female figure holding a spray and scepter. Coins of this type were minted in the city of [[Lugdunum]] in [[Gaul]], between 16 and 21 CE.&lt;ref&gt;Sarianidi, Victor. 1985. ''The Golden Hoard of Bactria: From the Tillya-tepe Excavations in Northern Afghanistan''. Harry N. Abrams, New York.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Tilia Tepe gold token. Kabub Museum.jpg|thumb|The [[Tillya Tepe Buddhist coin]], with naked deity wearing [[chlamys]] cape and [[petasus]] hat pushing the [[Dharmachakra|Wheel of the Law]]. [[Kabul Museum]].]]
A Buddhist gold coin from India was also found in tomb IV (the male warrior). On the reverse, it depicts a lion with a [[nandipada]], with the [[Kharoshthi]] legend "Sih[o] vigatabhay[o]" ("The lion who dispelled fear"). On the obverse, an almost naked man only wearing an Hellenistic [[chlamys]] and a [[petasus]] hat (an iconography similar to that of [[Hermes]]/ [[Mercury (mythology)|Mercury]]) rolls a wheel. The legend in Kharoshthi reads "Dharmacakrapravata[ko]" ("The one who turned the Wheel of the Law"). It has been suggested that this may be an early representation of the [[Buddha]].&lt;ref&gt;"Il semble qu'on ait là la plus ancienne représentation du Buddha, selon une modalité qui n'est pas encore celle de l'iconograhie boudhique traditionnelle" (French): "It seems this might be the earliest representation of the Buddha, in a style which is not yet that of traditional Buddhist iconography", in ''Afghanistan, les trésors retouvés'', p. 280.&lt;/ref&gt;

Finally, a very worn coin has been identified as belonging to the Yuezhi chieftain [[Heraios]].

It is thought that the site belonged to [[Sakas]] (Asian [[Scythians]], who were later to migrate to India, where they are known as [[Indo-Scythians]]), although some suggest the [[Yuezhi]] (future [[Kushan]]s) or eastern [[Parthian Empire|Parthians]] as an alternative. Several of the artifacts are highly consistent with a Scythian origin, such as the royal crown or the polylobed decorated daggers discovered in the tombs. Several of the defuncts exhibited ritual deformation of the skull, a practice which is well documented among Central Asian nomads of the period.

==Cultural influences==
[[File:TritonsWithDolphins.jpg|thumb|left|310px|Hellenistic tritons with dolphins (Tomb I.).]]
These pieces have much in common with the famous [[Scythian art|Scythian]] gold artifacts recovered thousands of kilometers west on the banks of the [[Bosphorus]] and the [[Thracian Chersonese|Chersonese]].

A high cultural [[syncretism]] pervades the findings, however. [[Hellenistic civilization|Hellenistic]] cultural and artistic influences can be found in many of the forms and human depictions (from [[putto|amorini]] to rings with the depiction of [[Athena]] and her name inscribed in [[Greek language|Greek]]), attributable to the existence of the [[Seleucid empire]] and [[Greco-Bactrian Kingdom]] in the same area until around 140 BCE, and the continued existence of the [[Indo-Greek Kingdom]] in the northwestern Indian sub-continent until the beginning of our era.

The artifacts were also intermixed with items coming from much farther, such as a few [[History of China|Chinese]] artifacts (especially Chinese bronze mirrors) as well as a few [[History of India|Indian]] ones (decorated ivory plates). This seems to be a testimony to the richness of cultural influences in the area of [[Bactria]] at that time.

==Loss and re-discovery==
[[File:Bactrian treasure - ram figurine.jpg|thumb|A ram figurine found in the hoard.]]
[[File:EucratidesStatere.jpg|thumb|180px|Gold [[stater]] of the Greco-Bactrian king [[Eucratides I|Eucratides]], the largest gold coin of the Ancient World.]]
The hoard was thought to have been lost at some point in the 1990s, the [[National Museum of Afghanistan]] having been looted numerous times resulting in a loss of 70% of the 100,000 objects on display.&lt;ref name=bbcmarch2011&gt;{{cite news | url = https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-south-asia-12599726 | title = Afghan gold: How the country's heritage was saved | first = Alastair | last = Lawson |date = 1 March 2011 | work = [[BBC]] | accessdate = 1 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2003, however, it was found in secret vaults under the central bank building in Kabul.

In 1989 following a committee decision, the last Communist president of Afghanistan, [[Mohammad Najibullah]] had ordered the hoard moved from the museum to an underground vault at the [[Central Bank of Afghanistan]] in Kabul. The doors of the vault were locked with keys which were distributed to five trusted individuals.&lt;ref name=bbcmarch2011/&gt;

In 2003, after the Taliban was deposed, the new government wanted to open the vault, but the keyholders (called "tawadars") could not be summoned because their names were purposefully unknown.  [[Hamid Karzai]] had to issue a decree authorizing the attorney general to go ahead with safecracking.  But in time, the five key-holders were successfully assembled and the vault opened. Since then, the National Geographic Society has catalogued the collection, which appears to be complete – 22,000 objects.  Also witnessing the re-opening were National Geographic Explorer and Archaeology Fellow [[Fredrik Hiebert]] and the archaeologist who originally found the hoard, [[Viktor Sarianidi]].

Following an agreement between the Afghan government and [[France]], the collection was evaluated and displayed internationally in an exhibition through the cooperation of several prominent museums and the National Geographic Society.  Objects were on display from 2007-2009 variously at the [[Musée Guimet]] in [[Paris]], the [[National Gallery of Art]] in [[Washington DC]], the [[Asian Art Museum of San Francisco|Asian Art Museum]] of [[San Francisco]], the [[Museum of Fine Arts, Houston|Museum of Fine Arts]] in [[Houston]], and the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] in [[New York City|New York]].&lt;ref&gt;Fredrik Hiebert and Pierre Cambon, eds.  Afghanistan: Hidden Treasures from the National Museum, Kabul. Washington DC: National Geographic, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Exhibitions==
Some of the most spectacular finds were a part of the traveling exhibition titled "Afghanistan: Hidden Treasures From the National Museum, Kabul" or "Afghanistan: Crossroads of the Ancient World" which were first on displayed in December 2006 in France’s [[Musee Guimet]] in Paris.  The exhibition supported by The National Geographic has also been to the [[National Gallery of Art]] in Washington, D.C. from May 25 to Sept. 7th, 2008; from Oct. 24th, 2008 to Jan. 25th, 2009 the collection was at the [[Asian Art Museum of San Francisco]]; from February 22 to May 17, 2009 it traveled to [[Museum of Fine Arts, Houston|The Museum of Fine Arts]], Houston then to the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]], New York from June 23 to Sept. 20th, 2009; [[Canadian Museum of Civilization]] in Gatineau-Ottawa held the exhibition from October 23, 2009, to March 28, 2010; [[Bonn Museum]] in Germany from June 11, 2010 to January 2, 2011 and from March 3, 2011 to July 3, 2011 the [[British Museum]] in London.  From July 26 to November 26, 2014 the exhibition shows at the [[Western Australian Museum]] in Perth and from May 17 to June 17, 2017 the [[Forbidden City|Palace Museum]] in Beijing.&lt;ref&gt;http://en.dpm.org.cn/exhibitions/current/2017-03-08/2603.html&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Museum of Oriental Art (Turin)|Museum of Oriental Art]] in [[Turin]], Italy, and [[Nieuwe Kerk (Amsterdam)|Nieuwe Kerk]] in [[Amsterdam]] also saw displays.&lt;ref&gt;''Afghanistan: Hidden Treasures from the National Museum, Kabul'' (2008), pp. 18-19.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Tinkinswood''' or its full name '''Tinkinswood Burial Chamber''' ({{lang-cy|Siambr Gladdu Tinkinswood}}), also known as '''Castell Carreg''', '''Llech-y-Filiast''' and '''Maes-y-Filiast''',&lt;ref name="Stone Pages"/&gt; is a [[megalith]]ic [[Chamber tomb|burial chamber]], built around 6,000 BP ([[before Present]]), during the [[Neolithic]] period, in the [[Vale of Glamorgan]], near [[Cardiff]], Wales.

The structure is called a [[dolmen]],&lt;ref name="waymarking" /&gt; which was the most common megalithic structure in Europe. The dolmen is of the [[Severn-Cotswold tomb]] type,&lt;ref name="Stone Pages"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Wood" /&gt;  and consists of a large capstone on top, with smaller upright stones supporting it. The [[limestone]] capstone at Tinkinswood weighs approximately 40&amp;nbsp;[[long ton]]s and measures {{convert|24|ft|m}} x {{convert|14|ft|m|abbr=on}};&lt;ref name="Stone Pages"&gt;{{Cite web|url= http://www.stonepages.com/wales/tinkinswood.html|

==History==
[[File:Tinkinswood Interior.JPG|thumb|left|Inside the burial chamber with the capstone on top]]
Tinkinswood was a once a village but now all that remains is the burial chamber, which was built about 6000 [[Before Present|BP]],&lt;ref name="Tinkinswood"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.valeofglamorgan.gov.uk/enjoying/visit_the_vale/attractions/historic/tinkinswood.aspx |publisher=Vale of Glamorgan Council |title= Tinkinswood and St Lythans Burial Chambers |accessdate=29 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; about 1,000 years or so before [[Stonehenge]] was constructed.&lt;ref name="Wood"&gt;{{Cite web|url= http://www.ansari.org.uk/Tinkinswood/More%20Details%20about%20the%20Tinkinswood%20Burial%20Cairn.htm|publisher= Peter Sain ley Berry|title= More details about the Tinkinswood burial cairn|accessdate= 29 May 2008|deadurl= yes|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110904032400/http://www.ansari.org.uk/Tinkinswood/More%20Details%20about%20the%20Tinkinswood%20Burial%20Cairn.htm|archivedate= 4 September 2011|df= dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The site was excavated in 1914,&lt;ref name="Stone Pages"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Wood"/&gt; and inside the chamber there were 920 human bones, which were nearly all broken. This showed that at least forty people of all ages and sexes were buried there during the Neolithic period; it would appear to be a burial chamber used by the whole settlement.&lt;ref name="Stone Pages"/&gt;  The corpses of the dead were probably left exposed before being moved into the burial chamber. Neolithic and [[Beaker culture|Bell-Beaker style pottery]] has also been found, this showed that the burial chamber tomb was probably used by a community over a long period of time, maybe up until the early [[Bronze Age]] period.&lt;ref name="Stone Pages"/&gt;  Restoration work was carried out at the same time, with a brick pillar built to support the capstone.&lt;ref name="Stone Pages"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Wood" /&gt;

From the site two parallel lines of stones form an avenue leading away from the burial chamber to the south east. Along a second avenue to the north east lie many stones. A large single stone stands due east, and two flat parallel standing stones point to the top of the nearby Coed Sion Hill.&lt;ref name="Wood" /&gt;

The site is managed by [[Cadw]],&lt;ref name="Stone" /&gt; which is a [[Welsh Assembly Government]] body responsible for the
protection, conservation and promotion of the built heritage of Wales.  In October 2011, new excavations began at the site.&lt;ref&gt;[http://tinkinswoodarchaeology.wordpress.com/2011/10/07/revealing-the-past-through-clearance-at-tinkinswood/#comment-41 Tinkinswood Community Archaeology]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Myths and legends==
Many of the myths and legends of Tinkinswood are also associated with the nearby burial site of [[St Lythans burial chamber|St Lythans]], a short distance away.&lt;ref name="Demon"/&gt; Legend has it that anyone who spends a night at Tinkinswood on the evenings before May Day, [[Nativity of St. John the Baptist|St John's Day]] (23 June), or [[Winter solstice|Midwinter Day]] would either die, go mad, or become a poet.&lt;ref name="Stone Pages"/&gt; This legend is similar to the general legend about mountain tops. The group of boulders to the south east of the monument are said to be women who were turned to stone for dancing on the [[Sabbath in Christianity|Sabbath]] day, another legend which is associated with dolmens.&lt;ref name="Demon"/&gt;

{{IPA notice}}
A '''tone contour''', or '''contour tone''', is a [[tone (linguistics)|tone]] in a tonal language which shifts from one pitch to another over the course of the syllable or word. Tone contours are especially common in [[East Asia|East]] and [[Southeast Asia]], but occur elsewhere, such as the [[Kru languages]] of Liberia and the [[Ju languages]] of [[Namibia]].

==Contours==
[[File:Pinyin Tone Chart.svg|right|thumb|150px|Chart (which is said to be invented by a Chinese linguist [[Yuen Ren Chao]]) illustrating the contours four tones in [[Standard Chinese]]]]
When the pitch descends, the contour is called a ''falling tone;'' when it ascends, a ''rising tone;'' when it descends and then returns, a ''dipping'' or ''falling-rising tone;'' and when it ascends and then returns, it is called a ''peaking'' or ''rising-falling tone.'' A tone in a contour-tone language which remains at approximately an even pitch is called a ''level tone.'' Tones which are too short to exhibit much of a contour, typically because of a final [[plosive consonant]], may be called ''[[checked tone|checked]], abrupt, clipped,'' or ''stopped tones.''

It has been theorized that the relative timing of a contour tone is not distinctive. That is, in some accents or languages a falling tone might fall at the end and in others it might fall at the beginning, but that such differences would not be distinctive. However, in [[Dinka language|Dinka]] it is reported that the phonemic falling tone falls late (impressionistically high level + fall, {{IPA|[˥˦˩]}}) while the falling allophone of the low tone starts early (impressionistically fall + low level, {{IPA|[˥˨˩]}}).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Remijsen|first1=Bert|title=Tonal alignment is contrastive in falling contours in Dinka|journal=Language|date=2013|volume=89|issue=2|pages=297–327|doi=10.1353/lan.2013.0023}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lexical tones more complex than dipping (falling–rising) or peaking (rising–falling) are quite rare, perhaps nonexistent, though prosody may produce such effects. The [[Old Xiang]] dialect of [[Qiyang dialect|Qiyang]] is reported to have two "double contour" lexical tones, high and low fall–rise–fall, or perhaps high falling – low falling and low falling – high falling: {{IPA|˦˨˧˨}} and {{IPA|˨˩˦˨}} (4232 and 2142). The report did not determine if the final fall was lexical or merely the declination typically seen at the ends of [[prosodic unit]]s, so these may actually be dipping tones.&lt;ref&gt;Zhu &amp; Zhang (2008) "A Seven-tone Dialect in Southern China with Falling-Rising-Falling Contour".

*[[Diacritic]]s such as falling {{angbr|{{IPA|â}}}}, rising {{angbr|{{IPA|ǎ}}}}, dipping {{angbr|{{IPA|a᷉}}}}, peaking {{angbr|{{IPA|a᷈}}}}, high falling {{angbr|{{IPA|a᷇}}}}, low falling {{angbr|{{IPA|a᷆}}}}, high rising {{angbr|{{IPA|a᷄}}}} and low rising {{angbr|{{IPA|a᷅}}}}. Or the simpler ''register tones,'' where diacritics such as high {{angbr|á}}, mid {{angbr|ā}}, and low {{angbr|à}} are usually sufficient for transcription. (These are also used for high, mid, and low level contour tones.)
*[[Tone letter]]s such as mid level {{angbr|{{IPA|˧}}}}, high falling {{angbr|{{IPA|˥˩}}}}, low falling {{angbr|{{IPA|˨˩}}}}, mid rising {{angbr|{{IPA|˧˥}}}}, low rising {{angbr|{{IPA|˩˧}}}}, dipping {{angbr|{{IPA|˨˩˦}}}}, and peaking {{angbr|{{IPA|˧˦˩}}}}.
*Numerical substitutions for tone letters. The seven tones above would be written {{angbr|33}}, {{angbr|51}}, {{angbr|21}}, {{angbr|35}}, {{angbr|13}}, {{angbr|214}}, {{angbr|341}}, for an Asian language, or {{angbr|3}}, {{angbr|15}}, {{angbr|45}}, {{angbr|31}}, {{angbr|53}}, {{angbr|452}}, {{angbr|325}}, for an African or American language. (The doubling of the numeral in {{angbr|33}} in the Asian example is used to disambiguate a mid level tone from a "tone 3" (3rd tone), which in general is not at pitch level 3.)
*Different spelling for the same vowel with different tones in systems like [[Latinxua Sin Wenz]], [[Gwoyeu Romatzyh]], [[Modern Literal Taiwanese]] etc. Compare Gwoyeu Romatzyh with Hanyu Pinyin (in parentheses): bai (bāi), bair (bái), bae (bǎi), bay (bài).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8212">In sociology, '''traditional society''' refers to a [[society]] characterized by an orientation to the past, not the future, with a predominant role for custom and habit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B0080430767020283 | doi=10.1016/B0-08-043076-7/02028-3 | year=2001 | encyclopedia=International Encyclopedia of the Social | pages=15829–15833 | last1 = Langlois | first1 = S.| title=International Encyclopedia of the Social &amp; Behavioral Sciences | isbn=9780080430768 | chapter=Traditions: Social }}&lt;/ref&gt; Such societies are marked by a lack of distinction between family and business, with the [[division of labor]] influenced primarily by age, gender, and status.&lt;ref&gt;S. Langlois, Traditions: Social, In: Neil J. Smelser and Paul B. Baltes, Editors-in-Chief, ''International Encyclopedia of the Social &amp; Behavioral Sciences'', Pergamon, Oxford, 2001, Pages 15829-15833, {{ISBN|978-0-08-043076-8}}, {{doi|10.1016/B0-08-043076-7/02028-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Traditional and modern==
Traditional society has often been contrasted with modern [[industrial society]], with figures like [[Durkheim]] and [[Pierre Bourdieu]] stressing such polarities as community vs. society or mechanical vs. organic solidarity;&lt;ref&gt;M.Grenfell, ''Pierre Bourdieu: Agent Provocateur'' (2004) p. 41-4&lt;/ref&gt; while [[Claude Lévi-Strauss]] saw traditional societies as 'cold' societies in that they refused to allow the historical process to define their social sense of legitimacy.&lt;ref&gt;Claude Lévi-Strauss, ''The Savage Mind'' (1989) p. 233–36&lt;/ref&gt;

Within [[Modernization theory|modernisation theory]], traditional society is also the first stage of economic development as established in [[Walt Whitman Rostow|W.W. Rostow]]'s Economic Growth Model. Classified as "pre-newtonian," science and technology are not practiced. Life is agrarian, and family or clan relationships are the basis for social structures.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title="The Five Stages of Growth." In Development and Underdevelopment: The Political Economy of Global Inequality|last=Rostow|first=W. W.|publisher=Lynne Rienner Publishers|year=1990|isbn=|location=Boulder and London|pages=9–16|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, theories positing the simple, [[unilineal evolution]] of societies from traditional to modern industrial are now seen as too simplistic,&lt;ref&gt;Langlois, in Smelser&lt;/ref&gt; relying on an [[ideal type|ideal typology]] revolving round such polarities as subsistence/growth; face-to-face/impersonal; [[informal social control]] or [[formal social control]]; collective ownership/private ownership.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.csupomona.edu/~ddwills/courses/ant352/readings352/Traditional%20and%20Modern.htm Traditional and Modern Societies] {{Webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20121212140429/http://www.csupomona.edu/~ddwills/courses/ant352/readings352/Traditional%20and%20Modern.htm |date=2012-12-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Recent work has emphasised instead the variety of traditional cultures, and the existence of intermediate forms as well as of 'alternative' modernisations.&lt;ref&gt;John R. Hall et al, ''Sociology on Culture'' (2003) p. 71-4&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ritual==

Traditional societies have been seen as characterised by powerful collective memories sanctioned by [[ritual]], and with social guardians ensuring continuity of communal practices.&lt;ref&gt;Ulrich Bech et al, ''Reflexive Modernisation'' (1994) p. 63-5&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Practice theory]] however has recently emphasised the role of ritual in facilitating change, as well as continuity.&lt;ref&gt;Hall, p. 78&lt;/ref&gt;

==Diversity==

[[Fredric Jameson]] saw 20th century modernisation as encountering two main kinds of traditional society, tribal, as in Africa, and bureaucratic imperial, as in China and India,&lt;ref&gt;M. Hardt/K. Weeks eds., ''The Jameson Reader'' (2005) p. 319&lt;/ref&gt; but a much wider diversity of traditional societies has existed over time.

For most of human existence, small tribes of hunter-gatherers leading an almost static existence formed the only social organisation: where they survived into the 20th century, as in Australia, paintings, songs, myths and rituals&lt;ref&gt;David Attenborough, ''Life on Earth'' (1992) p. 304&lt;/ref&gt; were all used to cement links to a deep-reaching sense of continuity with ancestors and ancestral ways.&lt;ref&gt;Emile Durkheim, ''The Elementary Forms of the Religious Life'' (1971) p. 276-80&lt;/ref&gt;

The invention of farming some 10,000 years ago led to the development of [[agrarian societies]], whether nomadic or peasant, the latter in particular almost always dominated by a strong sense of traditionalism.&lt;ref&gt;Max Weber, ''The Sociology of Religion'' (1971) p. 81&lt;/ref&gt; Within agrarian society, however, a wide diversity still existed. [[Homeric]] Greece  was a society marked by powerful kinship bonds, fixed status and rigidly defined social expectations;&lt;ref&gt;M. I. Finley, ''The World of Odysseus'' (1967) p. 89 and p. 133-4&lt;/ref&gt; with the classical [[polis]], however, though festivals, in [[M. I. Finley]]'s words, still "recreated for their audiences the unbroken web of all life, stretching back over generations of men to the gods",&lt;ref&gt;Quoted J. H Plumb, ''The Death of the Past'' (1969) in p. 24-5&lt;/ref&gt; new and more complex voluntary forms of social and public life balanced traditional society in a new equilibrium.&lt;ref&gt;J.Boardman et al eds., ''The Oxford History of the Classical World'' (1991) p. 232&lt;/ref&gt;

Medieval Europe was an intensely local society of self-perpetuating peasant households,&lt;ref&gt;E. Le Roy Ladurie, ''Montaillou'' (1980) p. 283 and p. 356&lt;/ref&gt; living within a slow moving culture dominated by customary law and by respect for ancient authority&lt;ref&gt;R. W. Southern , ''The Making of the Middle Ages'' (1993) p. 74-5&lt;/ref&gt; and pervaded with an ahistorical political [[mentality]] focused upon the concepts of experience, usage, and law-as-custom.&lt;ref&gt;J. H. Hexter, ''On Historians'' (1979) p. 269-71&lt;/ref&gt;
In some villages, you find digging being done as a community. People farm together and when harvesting time comes, they share the harvests. So there is communal work as a means of simplifying work and this earns them security to themselves and their produce. This is witnessed in some parts of Buganda like in Lumanyo, Maddu, Gomba District.

==Enlightenment and post-traditionalism==

Much of the focus of [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] thinking was directed at undoing the mindset of traditional society, and replacing a focus upon such concepts as rural, hierarchical, customary or status with one centred on the ideas of urban, egalitarian, progressive or contractual. [[Modernism]] and [[modernity]] continued the process of challenging and overcoming traditional society.&lt;ref&gt;Hardt, p. 264 and p. 251-2&lt;/ref&gt;

Jameson, however, has seen as a defining feature of [[postmodernism]] the global elimination of residual, 'traditional' enclaves, giving it its one-dimensional, temporal nature that is no longer offset by living examples of the past alongside the new.&lt;ref&gt;M. Hardt, p. 240-4&lt;/ref&gt;

==Internet==

Global media such as the [[Internet]] have been seen as effective means of recreating traditional cultures.&lt;ref&gt;Kate Fox, ''Watching the English'' (2004) p. 14&lt;/ref&gt; However, a key contrast now with traditional societies as they were is that participation has become voluntary instead of being ascriptive: fixed in space, social stratification and role expectations.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Worsley ed., ''The New Modern Sociology Readings'' (1991) p. 317&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Bishop William Beveridge (6464933159).jpg|thumb]]
'''William Beveridge''' (1637 – 5 March 1708) was an English writer and clergyman who served as [[Bishop of St Asaph]] from 1704 until his death.

==Life==
Son of the Rev. William Beveridge, B.D., he was born at [[Barrow upon Soar|Barrow]], near Leicester, and baptised on February 21, 1637, at Barrow, Leicestershire, of which his grandfather, father, and elder brother John were successively vicars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=History of Leicestershire | last=Nichols |pages=iii. part i 77–78}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was first taught by his learned father and for two years was sent to [[Oakham School]], Rutland, where [[William Cave]] was his school fellow.

On 24 May 1653 he was admitted a sizar in [[St John's College, Cambridge]],&lt;ref&gt;{{acad|id=BVRG653W|name=Beveridge, William}}&lt;/ref&gt; with Bullingham as his tutor.  
Dr. [[Anthony Tuckney]] was then head of the college, and took a special interest in young Beveridge. Beveridge specially devoted himself to the learned languages, including the oriental. In his twenty-first year he published a Latin treatise on the ''Excellency and Use of the Oriental Tongues, especially Hebrew, Chaldee, Syriac, and Samaritan, together with a Grammar of the Syriac Language,'' (1658; 2nd ed. 1664). In 1656, he proceeded H.A., and in 1660 M.A. On 3 January 1660-1 he was ordained deacon by Dr. [[Robert Sanderson (theologian)|Robert Sanderson]], [[Bishop of Lincoln]].

He was rector of [[Ealing]], 1661–72, and of [[St. Peter's, Cornhill]], London, 1672–1704, when he became bishop. On 22 December 1674 he was collated to the prebend of [[Chiswick]] in St. Paul's, London. In 1679 he proceeded D.D. On 3 November 1681 he was appointed [[Archdeacon of Colchester]].&lt;ref&gt;Kennett, Biog. Coll. liii. 292&lt;/ref&gt; On 27 November 1681 he preached a sermon on the ''Excellency and Usefulness of the Common Prayer.'' It rapidly went through four editions. In 1683 he preached another popular sermon on the anniversary of the [[Great Fire of London]] in 1666. On 5 November 1684 he was made [[prebendary]] of Canterbury in succession to [[Peter du Moulin]]. In 1687-8 he joined with Dr. Horneck and others in forming religious societies for 'reformation of manners.'&lt;ref&gt;Woodward, Account of the Rise and Progress of the Religious Societies&lt;/ref&gt; In 1689 he became president of [[Sion College]]. He was installed bishop of [[St. Asaph]] on 16 July 1704.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Dictionary of National Biography | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QdceippDYIEC&amp;pg=PA447#v=onepage&amp;q=William%20beveridge&amp;f=false | last=Grosart | first=Rev. A. B. | year=1885 | pages=447–448}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He died in apartments in the cloisters of Westminster Abbey in London on 5 March 1708.

During his lifetime Beveridge refused to sit for his portrait,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A Catalogue of the Pictures, Models, Busts, &amp;c. in the Bodleian gallery, Oxford|first= John|last=Norris|pages=8–12}}&lt;/ref&gt; but following his death [[Benjamin Ferrers]], a relative, painted one, now in the [[Bodleian Library]], Oxford, from his corpse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite DNB|wstitle=Ferrers, Benjamin}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Works==
In his day he was styled "the great reviver and restorer of primitive piety" because in his sermons and other writings he dwelt on the Church of the early centuries. His collected works (incomplete) are in the ''[[Library of Anglo-Catholic Theology]]'' in 12 volumes (Oxford, 1842–48). They contain six volumes of sermons, and in addition:
*''The Doctrine of the Church of England Consonant to Scripture, Reason, and the Fathers: A Complete System of Divinity'' (2 vols.);
* [https://books.google.ru/books?id=mzWuhCgih08C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;hl=ru#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false ''Συνοδικόν, sive pandectae canonum ss. Apostolorum, et conciliorum ab ecclesia Graeca receptorum; nec non canonicarum ss. patrum epistolarum; nec non canonicarum SS. patrum epistolarum: una cum scholiis antiquorum singulis eorum annexis, et scriptis aliis huc spectantibus; ... Totum opus in duos tomos divisum Guilielmus Beveregius ... recensuit, prolegomenis munivit, &amp; annotationibus auxit,]''. ''Codex canonum ecclesiæ primitivæ vindicatus ac illustratus, with the appendices, I. Prolegomena in  Συνοδικὸν, sive pandectas canonum''; and ''II. Præfatio ad annotationes in canones apostolicos'' (2 vols.);
*''Private Thoughts on Religion, and Church Catechism Explained''.

His ''Institutionum chronotogicarum libri duo, una cum totidem arithmetices chronologicæ libellis'' (London, 1669) was once an admired treatise on chronology. In it he also includes a full explanation of the [[Chinese remainder theorem]] for the case in which the moduli are relatively prime.  This was the first general proof of the ''ta-yen'' rule.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Chinese Mathematics in the Thirteenth Century | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hChTX2NlHUgC&amp;lpg=PA263&amp;dq=William%20Beveridge%20Arithmetica&amp;pg=PA265#v=onepage&amp;q=William%20Beveridge%20Arithmetica&amp;f=false | first= Ulrich | last=Libbrecht|pages=263–265}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also said by [[Francis Fauvel Gouraud]] that a discussion on Hebrew linguistics inspired [[Richard Grey (priest)]] to create his system of mnemotechniques which later evolved in to the [[Mnemonic major system]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Phreno-mnemotechny: Or, The Art of Memory | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dawRAAAAYAAJ&amp;dq=Beveridge%20memory&amp;pg=PA62#v=onepage&amp;q=Beveridge&amp;f=false | first= Francis| last=Fauvel-Gouraud |pages=61–62}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7021">'''Winfred Philip Lehmann''' (23 June 1916, [[Surprise, Nebraska]] – 1 August 2007, [[Austin, Texas]]) was an [[United States|American]] linguist noted for his work in [[historical linguistics]], particularly [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] and [[Proto-Germanic language|Proto-Germanic]], as well as for pioneering work in [[machine translation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Drinka|2007|p=225}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
After receiving [[Bachelor's degree|B.A.]] in Humanities at [[Martin Luther College|Northwestern College]] in [[Watertown, Wisconsin]] in 1936, he went on to receive his [[Master's degree]] from the [[University of Wisconsin–Madison]] in 1938 and a [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] in 1941, both in [[Germanic philology]] at the University of Wisconsin.

Early in his career, during [[World War II]], he served in the [[Signal Corps (United States Army)|U.S. Army Signal Corps]] as Officer-in-Charge of the [[Japanese language|Japanese]] Language School and Japanese instructor. After the war he became Assistant Professor in the Department of [[German language|German]] at [[Washington University in St. Louis]], and was recruited in 1949 to the [[University of Texas at Austin]] as an Associate Professor of Germanic Linguistics. He was promoted to a Full Professor in 1951, and chaired that department from 1953 to 1964. He was largely responsible for developing that program into the Department of Linguistics at the University of Texas, and served as its first Chair, in the period 1964–1972.

==Awards and honors==
He received [[Fulbright Program|Fulbright Research Fellowship]] to [[Norway]] in 1950–51, and a [[Guggenheim Fellowship]] in 1972–73. He served as Director of the Georgetown English Language Program in [[Ankara]], [[Turkey]] in 1955–56, as Chairman of the Linguistics Delegation to the People's Republic of [[China]] in 1974, and as Co-Chairman of the Commission on Humanities and Social Sciences to the People's Republic of China in 1981. He was elected President of the Association for Computational Linguistics in 1964. He is the only person to have served as both the President of the [[Linguistic Society of America]], in 1973, and the [[Modern Language Association]] of America, in 1987.

Upon his retirement in 1986, scholars from [[Western Europe]], the [[Soviet Union]] and the U.S. gathered at the University of Texas to honor him at an IREX Conference on Linguistic Reconstruction. The volume which grew from this conference, ''Reconstructing Languages and Cultures'' (1992, edited by [[Edgar Charles Polomé]] and [[Werner Winter (linguist)|Werner Winter]]), points to the worldwide impact of Lehmann's work on Indo-European and historical linguistics.

Lehmann was also honored by two other [[Festschrift]]s, in 1977 and in 1999.

In 2007, Lehmann received the "[http://eamt.org/award.php IAMT Award of Honor]" (in memoriam) from the International Association for Machine Translation.

==Work and legacy==
Beside being responsible for launching two extremely successful departments at the University of Texas, he is also credited for the establishment of the [[Linguistics Research Center at UT Austin]], where he served as the Director from 1961 until his death.

His well-known books on Proto-Indo-European and historical linguistics include:

An important contribution was his ''Proto-Indo-European Syntax'', the first and one of the few existing treatments of Proto-Indo-European syntax in a [[generative grammar|generative]] framework.

In his last book (2002), he assembled extensive data from the nominal and verbal systems, from the lexicon, [[phonology]], and [[syntax]] of the ancient IE languages, to argue that [[Proto-Indo-European language|Pre-Indo-European]] was [[Active–stative language|active/stative]] in alignment, rather than [[Nominative–accusative language|nominative/accusative]]. With [[Tamaz V. Gamkrelidze|Gamkrelidze]] and [[Vyacheslav Ivanov (philologist)|Ivanov]], Lehmann accounted for the similarity of the IE middle and perfect paradigms to the [[Hittite language|Hittite]] ''hi''-conjugation by postulating an ancient stative ancestor for all three.

He authored over 50 books and special issues of journals as well as 250 scholarly articles. In the period 1951–1986 he directed approximately fifty doctoral dissertations. Since 1986 he was Louann and Larry Temple Centennial Professor Emeritus in the Humanities at the UT-Austin.

His wife, [[Ruth Preston Miller Lehmann]] (died in 2000), was also a distinguished historical linguist.

{{basic forms of government}}
'''World government''' or '''global government''' is the notion of a common [[political]] authority for all of humanity, yielding a global [[government]] and a single [[state (polity)|state]] that exercises [[authority]] over the entire [[Earth]]. Such a government could come into existence either through violent and compulsory [[world domination]] or through peaceful and voluntary [[supranational union]].

There has never been a worldwide [[executive (government)|executive]], [[legislature]], [[judiciary]], [[military]], or [[constitution]] with global jurisdiction. The [[United Nations]], beyond the [[United Nations Security Council]] (which has the ability to issue mandatory resolutions), is limited to a mostly advisory role, and its stated purpose is to foster co-operation between existing [[nation|national]] governments rather than exert authority over them.

==History==

===Origins of the idea===
The idea and aspiration of world government has been known since the dawn of history. Bronze Age Egyptian Kings aimed to rule "All That the Sun Encircles", Mesopotamian Kings "All from the Sunrise to the Sunset", and ancient Chinese and Japanese Emperors "All under Heaven". These four civilizations developed impressive cultures of [[Great Unity]], or Da Yitong as the Chinese put it. In 113 BC, the Han Dynasty in China erected an Altar of the Great Unity.&lt;ref&gt;[[Sima Qian]] II:38-40&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Polybius]] said that the Roman achievement of imposing one Government over the Mediterranean world was a "marvelous" achievement, and that the main task of future historians will be to explain how this was done.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.humanistictexts.org/polybius.htm | title=The Histories of Polybius | volume=1 | author=[[Polybius]] | translator=Evelyn S. Shuckburg from the text of F. Hultsch | year=1889 | accessdate=March 24, 2016 | publisher=Macmillan and Co | location=London and New York | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160328103700/http://www.humanistictexts.org/polybius.htm | archive-date=2016-03-28 | dead-url=no | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dante===
The idea of world government outlived the fall of the [[Pax Romana]] for a millennium. [[Dante]] in the fourteenth century despairingly appealed to the human race: "But what has been the condition of the world since that day the seamless robe [of Pax Romana] first suffered mutilation by the claws of avarice, we can read—would that we could not also see! O human race! what tempests must need toss thee, what treasure be thrown into the sea, what shipwrecks must be endured, so long as thou, like a beast of many heads, strivest after diverse ends! Thou art sick in either intellect, and sick likewise in thy affection. Thou healest not thy high understanding by argument irrefutable, nor thy lower by the countenance of experience. Nor dost thou heal thy affection by the sweetness of divine persuasion, when the voice of the Holy Spirit breathes upon thee, "Behold, how good and how pleasant it is for brethren to dwell together in unity!"" (''[[De Monarchia]]'', 16:1)

===Francisco de Vitoria===
{{Main|Francisco de Vitoria}}

Early father of international law, [[Spain|Spanish]] philosopher [[Francisco de Vitoria]] (c. 1483–1546) is considered the "founder of global political philosophy". De Vitoria conceived of the ''res publica totius orbis'', or the "republic of the whole world". This came at a time when the [[University of Salamanca]] was engaged in unprecedented thought concerning [[human rights]], [[international law]], and early economics based on the experiences of the [[Spanish Empire]].

===Hugo Grotius===
{{Main|Hugo Grotius}}
[[File:381px-Grotius de jure 1631.jpg|thumb|150px|Title page of the 1631 second edition of ''[[De jure belli ac pacis]]'']]

''[[De jure belli ac pacis]]'' (''On the Law of War and Peace'') is a 1625 book in Latin, written by [[Hugo Grotius]] (1583–1645) and published in Paris, on the legal status of war. It is now regarded as a foundational work in [[international law]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.library.usyd.edu.au/libraries/rare/modernity/grotius.html USYD.edu.au] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081220195422/http://www.library.usyd.edu.au/libraries/rare/modernity/grotius.html |date=2008-12-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Grotius was a philosopher, theologian, playwright, and poet. He is known for coming up with the idea of having an international law, and is still acknowledged today by the American Society of International Law.

===Immanuel Kant===
[[File:Immanuel Kant (painted portrait).jpg|thumb|right|Writing in 1795, [[Immanuel Kant]] considered World Citizenship to be a necessary step in establishing world peace]]
[[Immanuel Kant]] wrote the essay "[[Perpetual Peace: A Philosophical Sketch]] ([[:de:Zum ewigen Frieden|Zum ewigen Frieden. Ein philosophischer Entwurf.]]) (1795)". In his essay, Kant describes three basic requirements for organizing human affairs to permanently abolish the threat of present and future war, and, thereby, help establish a new era of [[Perpetual peace|lasting peace]] throughout the world. Specifically, Kant described his proposed peace program as containing two steps.

The "Preliminary Articles" described the steps that should be taken immediately, or with all deliberate speed:

# "No Secret Treaty of Peace Shall Be Held Valid in Which There Is Tacitly Reserved Matter for a Future War"
# "No Independent States, Large or Small, Shall Come under the Dominion of Another State by Inheritance, Exchange, Purchase, or Donation"
# "[[Standing army|Standing Armies]] Shall in Time Be Totally Abolished"
# "National Debts Shall Not Be Contracted with a View to the External Friction of States"
# "No State Shall by Force Interfere with the Constitution or Government of Another State,
# "No State Shall, during War, Permit Such Acts of Hostility Which Would Make Mutual Confidence in the Subsequent Peace Impossible: Such Are the Employment of Assassins (percussores), Poisoners (venefici), Breach of Capitulation, and Incitement to Treason (perduellio) in the Opposing State"

Three Definitive Articles would provide not merely a cessation of hostilities, but a foundation on which to build a peace.

# "The Civil Constitution of Every State Should Be Republican"
# "The Law of Nations Shall be Founded on a Federation of Free States"
# "The Law of World Citizenship Shall Be Limited to Conditions of Universal Hospitality"

===Johann Gottlieb Fichte===
The year of the battle at Jena (1806), when Napoleon overwhelmed Prussia, [[Johann Gottlieb Fichte|Fichte]] in ''Characteristics of the Present Age'' described what he perceived to be a very deep and dominant historical trend:

{{quote|
There is necessary tendency in every cultivated State to extend itself generally... Such is the case in Ancient History ... As the States become stronger in themselves and cast off that [Papal] foreign power, the tendency towards a Universal Monarchy over the whole Christian World necessarily comes to light... This tendency ... has shown itself successively in several States which could make pretensions to such a dominion, and since the fall of the Papacy, it has become the sole animating principle of our History... Whether clearly or not—it may be obscurely—yet has this tendency lain at the root of the undertakings of many States in Modern Times... Although no individual Epoch may have contemplated this purpose, yet is this the spirit which runs through all these individual Epochs, and invisibly urges them onward.&lt;ref&gt;Fichte, (1806). "Characteristics of the Present Age," ''Theory and Practice of the Balance of Power, 1486–1914: Selected European Writings'', (ed. Moorhead Wright, London: Rowman &amp; Littlefield, 1975, pp. 87–89).&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Joseph Smith===
{{Main|World Government (Mormonism)}}
{{See also|Theodemocracy}}

In early 19th century [[Mormon]] theology, [[Joseph Smith]] taught that a [[theodemocracy]] would guide and direct the [[Kingdom of God]] ([[Zion (Latter Day Saints)|Zion]]) on the earth during the [[end time]]s. On March 11, 1844, Smith organized a [[Council of Fifty]], who were to work under the direction of the [[Priesthood (Latter Day Saints)|Priesthood]] authorities of his church, along with a [[Council of Friends]]. This group of three organizations was expected to rule as a world government just prior to the [[Millennialism|Millennium]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Andrus |first= Hyrum Leslie |date= 1958 |title= Joseph Smith and World Government |location= Salt Lake City, Utah |publisher= [[Deseret Book]] |oclc= 4146522 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BYUR1.1"&gt;{{cite book |url= https://byustudies.byu.edu/showtitle.aspx?title=7034 |contribution= Joseph Smith and World Government |title= Book Reviews |first= Robert E. |last= Riggs |pages= 71–73 |journal= [[BYU Studies]] |volume= 1 |issue= 1 |date= Winter 1959 |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20111107125015/http://byustudies.byu.edu/showtitle.aspx?title=7034 |archivedate= 2011-11-07 |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url= https://www.sunstonemagazine.com/pdf/141-32-41.pdf |title= The Grand Fundamental Principles of Mormonism: Joseph Smith's Unfinished Reformation |first= Don |last= Bradley |date= April 2006 |journal= [[Sunstone (magazine)|Sunstone]] |pages= 32–41 |access-date= 2012-02-06 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20120904140634/https://www.sunstonemagazine.com/pdf/141-32-41.pdf |archive-date= 2012-09-04 |dead-url= no |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Alfred, Lord Tennyson===
In 1842, the English poet [[Alfred, Lord Tennyson]], published the oft-quoted lines "[[Locksley Hall]]": ''For I dipt into the future, far as human eye could see / Saw a Vision of the world, and all the wonder that would be /... / Till the war-drum throbb'd no longer / and the battle-flags were furled / In the Parliament of man, the Federation of the world. / There the common sense of most shall hold / a fretful realm in awe / And the kindly earth shall slumber / lapt in universal law''.

===Ulysses S. Grant===
President [[Ulysses S. Grant]] was convinced in 1873: "Transport, education and rapid development of both spiritual and material relationships by means of steam power and the telegraph, all this will make great changes. I am convinced that the Great Framer of the World will so develop it that it becomes one nation, so that armies and navies are no longer necessary."&lt;ref&gt;Cited in [[Clarence Streit]], [[Union Now|Union Now: The Proposal for Inter-Democracy Federal Union]], (London &amp; New York: Harper &amp; Brothers Publishers, 1940), p 31.&lt;/ref&gt;

He also commented, "I believe at some future day, the nations of the earth will agree on some sort of congress which will take cognizance of international questions of difficulty and whose decisions will be as binding as the decisions of the Supreme Court are upon us".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Schwartzberg |first= Joseph E. |authorlink= Joseph E.

===William Gladstone===
The first thinker to anticipate a kind of world unity ("great household of the world") under the American primacy seems to be British politician [[William Gladstone]]. In 1878, he wrote:

{{quote|
While we have been advancing with portentous rapidity, America is passing us by as if a canter. There can hardly be a doubt, as between America and England, of the belief that the daughter at no very distant time will ... be unquestionably yet stronger than the mother ... She [America] will probably become what we are now—head servant in the great household of the world...&lt;ref&gt;Cited in [[Hans Kohn]], "The US and Western Europe: A New Era of Understanding," ''Orbis'', 6/1,  (1962): p 17.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Kang Youwei===
In 1885, [[Kang Youwei]] published his ''One World Philosophy'', where he based his vision on the evidence of political expansion which began in the immemorial past and went in his days on.&lt;ref name="The One World Philosophy 1958, p. 85"&gt;[[K'ang Yu-wei]], (1885): ''The One World Philosophy'', (tr. Thompson, Lawrence G., London, 1958, p. 85).&lt;/ref&gt; He concludes:

{{quote|Finally, the present Powers of the world were formed.  This process [of coalescing and forming fewer, larger units] has all taken place among the 10,000 countries over several thousand years. The progression from dispersion to union among men, and the principle [whereby] the world is [gradually] proceeding from being partitioned off to being opened up, is a spontaneous [working] of the Way of Heaven (or Nature) and human affairs.&lt;ref&gt;[[K'ang Yu-wei]], (1885): ''The One World Philosophy'', (tr. Thompson, Lawrence G., London, 1958, p. 79).&lt;/ref&gt;}}

No factor, he believed, in the long run could resist the "laws of empires".&lt;ref&gt;[[Kang Youwei]], (1885): ''The One World Philosophy'', (tr. Thompson, Lawrence G., London, 1958, pp. 79–80, 85).&lt;/ref&gt; Kang Youwei projects the culmination of the ongoing world unification with the final confrontation between the United States and Germany: "Some day America will take in [all the states of] the American continent and Germany will take in all the [states of] Europe.  This will hasten the world along the road to One World."&lt;ref name="The One World Philosophy 1958, p. 85"/&gt;

===Friedrich Nietzsche===
[[Friedrich Nietzsche]] in his ''Beyond Good and Evil'' (1886) envisaged: 
{{quote|
I should rather prefer such an increase in the threatening attitude of Russia, that Europe would have to make up its mind to become equally threatening—namely to acquire one will, by means of a new caste to rule over the Continent, a persistent, dreadful will of its own, that can set its aims thousands of years ahead. The time for petty politics is past; the next century will bring the struggle for the domination of the world.&lt;ref&gt;Cited in Derwent Whittlesey, ''German Strategy of World Conquest'', (Essex: F. E. Robinson &amp; Co, 1942), p 26.&lt;/ref&gt; }}

===Vacher de Lapouge===
The French demographer, George [[Vacher de Lapouge]], followed K'ang Yu-wei in 1899 with his ''L'Aryen: Son Role Social''. Similarly, he outlined the logistic growth of empires from the Bronze Age till his days, when "six states govern... three quarters of the globe", and concluded: "The moment is close when the struggle for the domination of the world is going to take place."&lt;ref&gt;George Vacher de Lapouge, ''L'Aryen: Son Role Social'', (Nantes, 1899: chapter "L'Avenir des Aryens," p. XXXI).&lt;/ref&gt;

Vacher de Lapouge did not bet on Washington and Berlin in the final contest for world domination contrary to K'ang Yu-wei. Like his earlier compatriot, [[Alexis de Tocqueville]], he guessed the Cold War contenders correctly but he went one step further. He estimated the chances of the United States as favorite in the final confrontation:

{{quote|The reign of Europe is over, well over... The future of France seems less certain but it is unnecessary to become illusioned... I do not believe by the way that Germany might count for a much longer future... We could... envisage... the possibility that England and her immense Empire comes to surrender to the United States. The latter... is the true adversary of Russia in the great struggle to come... I also believe that the United States is appealed to triumph. Otherwise, the universe would be Russian.&lt;ref&gt;George [[Vacher de Lapouge]], ''L'Aryen: Son Role Social'', (Nantes, 1899: chapter "L'Avenir des Aryens," pp. XXXI–XXXII).&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Bahá'u'lláh===
In the second half of the 19th century, [[Bahá'u'lláh]] founded the [[Bahá'í Faith]], a religion which identified the establishment of world unity and a global federation of nations as a key principle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = Bahá'í International Community | date = 1995 | title = Turning Point for All Nations | url = http://bahai-library.com/uhj_turning_point_nations#II | access-date = 2013-03-29 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20130406044732/http://bahai-library.com/uhj_turning_point_nations#II | archive-date = 2013-04-06 | dead-url = no | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;  He envisioned a [[Bahá'í administration|set of new social structures]] based on participation and consultation among the world's peoples, including a world legislature, an international court, and an international executive empowered to carry out the decisions of these legislative and judicial bodies. [[Bahá'í Faith#Social principles|Connected principles of the Bahá'í religion]] include universal systems of weights and measures, currency unification, and the adoption of a global auxiliary language.&lt;ref name="Neusner2009"&gt;{{cite book|last=McMullen|first=Mike|editor=Neusner, Jacob|editor-link=Jacob Neusner|title=World Religions in America|edition=4th|date=2009|publisher=Westminster John Knox Press|location=Louisville, Ky|isbn=0-664-23320-1|chapter=The Bahá'í Faith}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[World Order of Bahá'u'lláh]],'' first published in 1938, [[Shoghi Effendi]], great-grandson of Bahá'u'lláh and the [[Guardian (Bahá'í Faith)|Guardian]] of the Bahá'í Faith from 1921 until his death in 1957, described the anticipated world government of that religion as the "world's future super-state" with the Bahá'í Faith as the "State Religion of an independent and Sovereign Power".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Shoghi |last=Effendi |authorlink=Shoghi Effendi |year=1938 |title=The World Order of Bahá’u’lláh |publisher=Bahá'í Publishing Trust |location=Wilmette, Illinois, USA |page=7 |chapter=Local and National Houses of Justice |chapter-url=http://reference.bahai.org/en/t/se/WOB/wob-3.html#pg7 |isbn=0-87743-231-7 |url=http://reference.bahai.org/en/t/se/WOB/index.html |access-date=2016-11-01 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161110184259/http://reference.bahai.org/en/t/se/WOB/index.html |archive-date=2016-11-10 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Shoghi Effendi, "The unity of the human race, as envisaged by Bahá'u'lláh, implies the establishment of a world commonwealth in which all nations, races, creeds and classes are closely and permanently united, and in which the autonomy of its state members and the personal freedom and initiative of the individuals that compose them are definitely and completely safeguarded. This commonwealth must, as far as we can visualize it, consist of a world legislature, whose members will, as the trustees of the whole of mankind, ultimately control the entire resources of all the component nations, and will enact such laws as shall be required to regulate the life, satisfy the needs and adjust the relationships of all races and peoples. A world executive, backed by an international Force, will carry out the decisions arrived at, and apply the laws enacted by, this world legislature, and will safeguard the organic unity of the whole commonwealth. A world tribunal will adjudicate and deliver its compulsory and final verdict in all and any disputes that may arise between the various elements constituting this universal system."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Shoghi |last=Effendi |authorlink=Shoghi Effendi |year=1938 |title=The World Order of Bahá’u’lláh |publisher=Bahá'í Publishing Trust |location=Wilmette, Illinois, USA |page=203 |chapter=World Unity the Goal |chapter-url=http://reference.bahai.org/en/t/se/WOB/wob-56.html#pg203 |isbn=0-87743-231-7 |url=http://reference.bahai.org/en/t/se/WOB/index.html |access-date=2016-11-01 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161110184259/http://reference.bahai.org/en/t/se/WOB/index.html |archive-date=2016-11-10 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his many scriptures and messages addressed to the most prominent state leaders of his time, Bahá'u'lláh called for world reconciliation, reunification, [[collective security]] and the peaceful settlement of disputes. Many of the most fundamental [[Bahá'í literature|Bahá'í writings]] address the central issue of world unity, such as the following: "The earth is but one country and mankind its citizens".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book  |author=Bahá'u'lláh  |authorlink=Bahá'u'lláh  |date=1976  |title=Gleanings from the Writings of Bahá'u'lláh  |publisher=Bahá'í Publishing Trust  |location=Wilmette, Illinois, USA  |isbn=0-87743-187-6  |url=http://reference.bahai.org/en/t/b/GWB/  |access-date=2013-03-29  |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130403063729/http://reference.bahai.org/en/t/b/GWB/  |archive-date=2013-04-03  |dead-url=no  |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt; The World Christian Encyclopedia estimated 7.1 million Bahá'ís in the world in 2000, representing 218 countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bible.ca/global-religion-statistics-world-christian-encyclopedia.htm|title=Global statistics for all religions: 2001 AD|author=|date=|website=www.bible.ca|accessdate=27 March 2018|archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/5xz7V0tX7?url=http://www.bible.ca/global-religion-statistics-world-christian-encyclopedia.htm|archive-date=2011-04-16|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===International Peace Congress===
{{Main|International Peace Congress}}
{{Expand section|date=October 2009}}

Starting in 1843, [[International Peace Congress]]es were held in [[Europe]] every two years, but lost their momentum after 1853 due to the renewed outbreak of wars in Europe ([[Crimea]]) and North America ([[American Civil War]]).

===International organizations===
{{Main|International organizations}}
[[File:Emblem of the ICRC.svg|thumb|150px|Emblem of the [[International Committee of the Red Cross]] ]]

International organizations started forming in the late 19th century – the [[International Committee of the Red Cross]] in 1863, the [[Telegraphic Union]] in 1865 and the [[Universal Postal Union]] in 1874. The increase in international trade at the turn of the 20th century accelerated the formation of international organizations, and, by the start of [[World War I]] in 1914, there were approximately 450 of them. Support for the idea of establishing international law grew during that period as well. The [[Institute of International Law]] was formed in 1873 by the Belgian Jurist [[Gustave Rolin-Jaequemyns]], leading to the creation of concrete legal drafts, for example by the Swiss [[Johaan Bluntschli]] in 1866.{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}} In 1883, [[James Lorimer (jurist)|James Lorimer]] published "The Institutes of the Law of Nations" in which he explored the idea of a world government establishing the global rule of law. The first embryonic world [[parliament]], called the [[Inter-Parliamentary Union]], was organized in 1886 by Cremer and Passy, composed of legislators from many countries. In 1904 the Union formally proposed "an international congress which should meet periodically to discuss international questions".

===H. G. Wells===
In ''[[Anticipations]]'' (1900), [[H. G. Wells]] envisaged that "the great urban region between Chicago and the Atlantic" will unify the English-speaking states, and this larger English-speaking unit, "a New Republic dominating the world", will by the year 2000 become the means "by which the final peace of the world may be assured forever". It will be "a new social Hercules that will strangle the serpents of war and national animosity in his cradle". Such a synthesis "of the peoples now using the English tongue, I regard not only as possible, but as a probable, thing".&lt;ref&gt;''[[Anticipations]]'', pp 100-101.&lt;/ref&gt; The New Republic "will already be consciously and pretty freely controlling the general affairs of humanity before this century closes..." Its principles and opinions "must necessarily shape and determine that still ampler future of which the coming hundred years is but the opening phase". The New Republic must ultimately become a "World-State".&lt;ref&gt;''[[Anticipations]]'', p 107.&lt;/ref&gt;

===League of Nations===
{{Main|League of Nations}}
{{See also|Fourteen Points}}

The [[League of Nations]] (LoN) was an inter-governmental organization founded as a result of the [[Treaty of Versailles]] in 1919–1920. At its largest size from 28 September 1934 to 23 February 1935, it had 58 members. The League's goals included upholding the [[Rights of Man]], such as the rights of non-whites, women, and soldiers; [[arms control|disarmament]], preventing war through [[collective security]], settling disputes between countries through negotiation, [[diplomacy]], and improving global [[quality of life]]. The diplomatic philosophy behind the League represented a fundamental shift in thought from the preceding hundred years. The League lacked its own armed force and so depended on the [[Great power|Great Powers]] to enforce its resolutions and economic sanctions and provide an army, when needed. However, these powers proved reluctant to do so. Lacking many of the key elements necessary to maintain world peace, the League failed to prevent World War II. Hitler withdrew Germany from the League of Nations once he planned to take over Europe. The rest of the Axis powers soon followed him. Having failed its primary goal, the League of Nations fell apart. The League of Nations consisted of the Assembly, the Council, and the Permanent Secretariat. Below these were many agencies. The Assembly was where delegates from all member states conferred. Each country was allowed three representatives and one vote.

===World Communism===
According to [[Karl Marx]]'s theory of [[historical materialism]], the capitalist epoch depends on the expansion of competing geopolitical markets across the planet, atomizing the global proletariat and thus sustaining economic disparity and rivalry between markets. Eventually, this will be succeeded by a Socialist epoch in which the working class throughout the world will unite to render national distinctiveness meaningless.

Although [[world Communism]]'s long-term goal is a worldwide [[Communist society]] that is stateless, which would entail an absence of any government, many [[anti-Communism|anti-Communists]] (especially during the [[Cold War]]) have considered it naive to think that the [[world revolution]] advocated by international Communists would lead to [[world domination]] by a single government or an alliance of several, yielding a [[de facto]] world government of a [[totalitarianism|totalitarian]] nature.

The heyday of international Communism was the period from the end of World War I (the [[revolutions of 1917–23]]) through the 1950s, before the [[Sino-Soviet split]].

===Halford Mackinder===
Anticipating environmental movements for world unity, like [[Global Scenario Group]], and such concepts as the [[Planetary phase of civilization]] and [[Spaceship Earth]], British Geographer [[Sir Halford Mackinder]] wrote in 1931:
{{quote| 
Gradually as the arts of life improved, the forests were cleared and the marshes were drained, and the lesser natural regions were fused into greater. It may perhaps be thought that with the continuance of this process all mankind will be in the end unified … Unless I mistake, it is the message of geography that international cooperation in any future that we need consider must be based on the federal idea. If our civilization is not to go down in blind internecine conflict, there must be a development of world planning out of regional planning, just as regional planning has come from town planning.&lt;ref&gt;"The Human Habitat," ''Scottish Geographical Magazine'', 47, (1931): p 333, also 335.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Nazi Germany===
{{Further|New Order (Nazism)|Lebensraum}}

The ruling [[Nazi Party]] of 1933–1945 [[Germany]] envisaged the ultimate establishment of a world government under the complete [[hegemony]] of the [[Third Reich]].&lt;ref name="Weinberg"&gt;Weinberg, Gerhard L. (1995) ''Germany, Hitler, and World War II: Essays in modern German and world history''. [[Cambridge University Press]], [https://books.google.com/books?id=9OfrTvu7CNYC&amp;pg=PA28&amp;dq=hitler+world+peace+can+be+obtained+only&amp;hl=nl&amp;ei=VqgYTcyqGYihOprn7LsJ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CDEQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=world%20peace&amp;f=false p. 36].&lt;/ref&gt; In its move to overthrow the post-[[World War I]] [[Treaty of Versailles]] Germany had already withdrawn itself from the [[League of Nations]], and it did not intend to join a similar [[Internationalism (politics)|internationalist]] organization ever again.&lt;ref&gt;Weinberg 1995, p. 37.&lt;/ref&gt; In his desire and stated political aim of expanding the living space (''Lebensraum'') of the German people by destroying or driving out "lesser-deserving races" in and from other territories dictator [[Adolf Hitler]] may have devised an ideological system of self-perpetuating [[expansionism]], in which the expansion of a state's population would require the conquest of more territory which would, in turn, lead to a further growth in population which would then require even more conquests.&lt;ref name="Weinberg"/&gt; In 1927, [[Rudolf Hess]] relayed to [[Walter Hewel]] Hitler's belief that [[world peace]] could only be acquired "when one power, the [[Racial supremacism|racially best one]], has attained uncontested supremacy". When this control would be achieved, this power could then set up for itself a world police and assure itself "the necessary living space.... The lower races will have to restrict themselves accordingly".&lt;ref name="Weinberg"/&gt;

===Imperial Japan===
During its imperial period (1868–1945), the Japanese elaborated a worldview, "''[[Hakkō ichiu]]''", translated as "eight corners of the world under one roof". This was the idea behind the attempt to establish a [[Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere|Greater Asian Coprosperity Sphere]] and behind the struggle for world domination.

===Atlantic Charter===
{{Main|Atlantic Charter}}
[[File:Atlanticcharter2.gif|thumb|right|150px|[[Winston Churchill]]'s edited copy of the final draft of the [[Atlantic Charter]] ]]

The [[Atlantic Charter]] was a published statement agreed between the [[United Kingdom]] and the [[United States]]. It was intended as the blueprint for the postwar world after [[World War II]], and turned out to be the foundation for many of the international agreements that currently shape the world. The [[General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade]] (GATT), the post-war independence of British and French possessions, and much more are derived from the Atlantic Charter. The Atlantic charter was made to show the goals of the allied powers during World War II. It first started with the United States and Great Britain, and later all the allies would follow the charter. Some goals include access to raw materials, reduction of trade restrictions, and freedom from fear and wants. The name, The Atlantic Charter, came from a newspaper that coined the title. However, Winston Churchill would use it, and from then on the Atlantic Charter was the official name. In retaliation, the Axis powers would raise their morale and try to work their way into Great Britain. The Atlantic Charter was a stepping stone into the creation of the United Nations.

===Harry Truman===
U.S. President [[Harry S. Truman]] commented: "We must make the United Nations continue to work, and to be a going concern, to see that difficulties between nations may be settled just as we settle difficulties between States here in the United States. When Kansas and Colorado fall out over the waters in the Arkansas River, they don't go to war over it; they go to the Supreme Court of the United States, and the matter is settled in a just and honorable way. There is not a difficulty in the whole world that cannot be settled in exactly the same way in a world court". -- President Truman's remarks in Omaha, Nebraska on June 5, 1948, at the dedication of the [[Memorial Park (Omaha)|War Memorial]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://trumanlibrary.org/publicpapers/viewpapers.php?pid=1647|title=Public Papers Harry S.

===World Federalist Movement===

{{Main|World Federalist Movement}}
{{Refimprove|date=March 2013}}

The years between the conclusion of World War II and 1950, when the [[Korean War]] started and the [[Cold War]] mindset became dominant in international politics, were the "golden age" of the world federalist movement. [[Wendell Willkie]]'s book ''[[One World (book)|One World]]'', first published in 1943, sold over 2 million copies. In another, [[Emery Reves]]' book ''[[The Anatomy of Peace]]'' (1945) laid out the arguments for replacing the UN with a federal world government and quickly became the "bible" of world federalists. The grassroots world federalist movement in the US, led by people such as [[Grenville Clark]], [[Norman Cousins]], [[Alan Cranston]] and [[Robert Hutchins]], organized itself into increasingly larger structures, finally forming, in 1947, the [[United World Federalists]] (later renamed to World Federalist Association, then [[Citizens for Global Solutions]]), claiming membership of 47,000 in 1949.

Similar movements concurrently formed in many other countries, leading to the formation, at a 1947 meeting in Montreux, Switzerland, of a global coalition, now called [[World Federalist Movement]]. By 1950, the movement claimed 56 member groups in 22 countries, with some 156,000 members.

===United Nations===
{{Main|United Nations}}
[[File:Emblem of the United Nations.svg|thumb|left|150px|Emblem of the [[United Nations]] ]]

[[World War II]] (1939–1945) resulted in an unprecedented scale of destruction of lives (over 60 million dead, most of them civilians), and the use of [[weapons of mass destruction]]. Some of the acts committed against civilians during the war were on such a massive scale of savagery, they came to be widely considered as [[crimes against humanity]] itself. As the war's conclusion drew near, many shocked voices called for the establishment of institutions able to permanently prevent deadly international conflicts. This led to the founding of the [[United Nations]] in 1945, which adopted the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] in 1948. Many, however, felt that the UN, essentially a forum for discussion and coordination between [[sovereignty|sovereign]] governments, was insufficiently empowered for the task. A number of prominent persons, such as [[Albert Einstein]], [[Winston Churchill]], [[Bertrand Russell]] and [[Mohandas K. Gandhi]], called on governments to proceed further by taking gradual steps towards forming an effectual federal world government. The United Nations main goal is to work on international law, international security, economic development, human rights, social progress, and eventually world peace. The United Nations replaced the League of Nations in 1945, after World War II. Almost every internationally recognized country is in the U.N.; as it contains 193 member states out of the 196 total nations of the world. The United Nations gather regularly in order to solve big problems throughout the world. There are six official languages: Arabic, Chinese, English, French, Russian and Spanish. The United Nations is also financed by some of the wealthiest nations. The flag shows the Earth from a map that shows all of the populated continents.

===Proposed United Nations Parliamentary Assembly===
{{Main|United Nations Parliamentary Assembly}}
[[File:Uno unpalogo.svg|thumb|250px|right|Emblem of the [[United Nations Parliamentary Assembly]] ]]

A [[United Nations Parliamentary Assembly]] (UNPA) is a proposed addition to the [[United Nations System]] that would allow for participation of member nations' legislators and, eventually, [[direct election]] of [[United Nations]] (UN) parliament members by citizens worldwide. The idea was raised at the founding of the [[League of Nations]] in the 1920s and again following the end of World War II in 1945, but remained dormant throughout the [[Cold War]]. In the 1990s and 2000s, the rise of global trade and the power of world organizations that govern it led to calls for a [[International parliament|parliamentary assembly]] to scrutinize their activity.&lt;ref name="CrossPartyCoalition"&gt;Watson, Graham (26 September 2007).

===Garry Davis===
In France, 1948, [[Garry Davis]] began an unauthorized speech calling for a world government from the balcony of the UN General Assembly, until he was dragged away by the guards. Davis [[renunciation of United States citizenship|renounced his American citizenship]] and started a [[Registry of World Citizens]]. On September 4, 1953, Davis announced from the city hall of [[Ellsworth, Maine]] the formation of the "World Government of World Citizens" based on 3 "World Laws"—One God (or Absolute Value), One World, and One Humanity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.worldservice.org/ells.html |title=Worldservice.org |access-date=2010-02-09 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100205043653/http://www.worldservice.org/ells.html |archive-date=2010-02-05 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Following this declaration, mandated, he claimed, by Article twenty one, Section three of the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]], he formed the United World Service Authority in New York City as the administrative agency of the new government. Its first task was to design and begin selling "World Passports", which the organisation argues is legitimatised by on Article 13, Section 2 of the UDHR.

====World Passport====
{{main|World Passport}}
The World Passport is a 45-page document sold by the [[World Service Authority]], a non-profit organization,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.romingerlegal.com/tenthcircuit/10th_circuit/99-1334.htm Romingerlegal.com&lt;!--Bot-generated title--&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100206221359/http://www.romingerlegal.com/tenthcircuit/10th_circuit/99-1334.htm|date=2010-02-06}}, 99-1334 - U.S. v. THOMAS - 07/07/2000&lt;/ref&gt; citing Article 13, Section 2, of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. World Passports have allegedly  been accepted sporadically by some 174 countries, but no immigration authority has a de facto or de jure policy of acceptance with regards to the document. The latest edition of the World Passport, which has been on sale since January 2007, is an MRD ([[Machine-readable passport|machine readable document]]) with an alphanumeric code bar enabling computer input plus an embedded "ghost" photo for security, printing overcovered with a plastic film. The document is in 7 languages: [[English language|English]], [[French language|French]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[Russian language|Russian]], [[Arabic]], [[Standard Chinese|Simplified Chinese]] and [[Esperanto]]. Two covers are available: "World Passport", and "World Government Passport" (for registered World Citizens), ("passport" is in 7 languages on both covers). Other documents sold by the WSA include a World Birth Certificate, a World Political Asylum Card, a World Marriage Certificate, and a World Identity Card. Each page within the document is numbered and each page has the World Citizen logo in the background. There are two pages for affiliation with companies, organizations, and firms. There are nineteen visa pages in the document. On the back cover there are spaces for personal information such as a person’s home address.

===Legal Realism (1954)===
{{Main|E. Adamson Hoebel}}

Legal anthropologist [[E. Adamson Hoebel]] concluded his treatise on broadening the legal realist tradition to include non-Western nations:&lt;ref&gt;''The Law of Primitive Man'' (1954:331–333)&lt;/ref&gt; "Whatever the idealist may desire, force and the threat of force are the ultimate power in the determination of international behavior, as in the law within the nation or tribe. But until force and the threat of force in international relations are brought under social control by the world community, by and for the world society, they remain the instruments of social anarchy and not the sanctions of world law. The creation in clear-cut terms of the corpus of world law cries for the doing. If world law, however, is to be realized at all, there will have to be minimum of general agreement as to the nature of the physical and ideational world and the relation of men in society to it. An important and valuable next step will be found in deep-cutting analysis of the major law systems of the contemporary world in order to lay bare their basic postulates – postulates that are too generally hidden; postulates felt, perhaps, by those who live by them, but so much taken for granted that they are rarely expressed or exposed for examination. When this is done – and it will take the efforts of many keen intellects steeped in the law of at least a dozen lands and also aware of the social nexus of the law – then mankind will be able to see clearly for the first time and clearly where the common consensus of the great living social and law systems lies. Here will be found the common postulates and values upon which the world community can build. At the same time the truly basic points of conflict that will have to be worked upon for resolution will be revealed. Law is inherently purposive".

===End of the Cold War (1992)===
While enthusiasm for multinational federalism in Europe incrementally led, over the following decades, to the formation of the [[European Union]], the onset of the [[Cold War]] (1945–1992) eliminated the prospects of any progress towards federation with a more global scope. The movement quickly shrank in size to a much smaller core of activists, and the world government idea all but disappeared from wide public discourse.

Following the end of the Cold War in 1992, interest in a federal world government and, more generally, in the global protection of human rights, was renewed. The most visible achievement of the world federalism movement during the 1990s is the [[Rome Statute]] of 1998, which led to the establishment of the [[International Criminal Court]] in 2002. In [[Europe]], progress towards forming a federal union of European states gained much momentum, starting in 1952 as a trade deal between the German and French people led, in 1992, to the [[Maastricht Treaty]] that established the name and enlarged the agreement that the [[European Union]] (EU) is based upon. The EU expanded (1995, 2004, 2007, 2013) to encompass, in 2013, over half a billion people in 28 member states. Following the EU's example, the [[African Union]] was founded in 2002 and the [[Union of South American Nations]] in 2008.

==Current global governance system==
[[File:Flag of the United Nations.svg|thumb|250px|right|Flag of the [[United Nations]]]]
[[File:Flag of WHO.svg|thumb|250px|right|Flag of the [[World Health Organization]]]]
{{As of|2018}}, there is no functioning global international [[military]], [[Executive (government)|executive]], [[legislature]], [[judiciary]], or [[constitution]] with jurisdiction over the entire planet.

The Earth is divided geographically and demographically into mutually exclusive territories and political structures called [[Sovereign state|states]] which are [[Independence|independent]] and [[sovereignty|sovereign]] in most cases. There are numerous bodies, institutions, unions, coalitions, agreements and contracts between these units of [[authority]], but, except in cases where a nation is under military occupation by another, ''all'' such arrangements depend on the continued consent of the participant nations.{{Citation needed|date=August 2015}}  Countries that violate or do not enforce international laws may be subject to penalty or coercion often in the form of economic limitations such as [[embargo]] by cooperating countries, even if the violating country is not part of the United Nations.  In this way a countries cooperation in international affairs is voluntary, but non-cooperation still has [[diplomacy|diplomatic]] consequences.

Among the voluntary organizations and international arrangements are:
* [[International law]]: Encompassing international treaties, customs and globally accepted legal principles. With the exceptions of cases brought before the ICC and ICJ (see below), the laws are interpreted by national courts. Many violations of treaty or customary law obligations are overlooked.
* [[United Nations]] (UN): The primary formal organization coordinating activities between states on a global scale and the only inter-governmental organization with a truly universal membership (193 governments). In addition to the main organs and various humanitarian programs and commissions of the UN itself, there are about 20 functional organizations affiliated with the UN's Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC), such as the [[World Health Organization]], the [[International Labour Organization]], and [[International Telecommunications Union]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.un.org/aboutun/chartlg.html UN.org] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120113054148/http://www.un.org/aboutun/chartlg.html |date=2012-01-13 }}, Chart&lt;/ref&gt; Of particular interest politically are the [[World Bank]], the [[International Monetary Fund]] and the [[World Trade Organization]].&lt;br/&gt;Militarily, the UN deploys [[peacekeeping]] forces, usually to build and maintain post-conflict peace and stability. When a more aggressive international military action is undertaken, either ''[[ad hoc]]'' coalitions (for example, the [[multinational force in Iraq]]) or regional [[military alliance]]s (for example, [[NATO]]) are used.
* [[Interpol|International Criminal Police Organization]] (Interpol): The international body for coordination and collaboration between national police agencies. Also operates the global [[Interpol notice]] system which includes the Interpol Red Notice, the "closest instrument to an international [[arrest warrant]] in use today".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.justice.gov/usao/eousa/foia_reading_room/usam/title9/crm00611.htm |title=Interpol Red Notices |website=[[United States Attorneys' Manual]] |publisher=[[United States Department of Justice]] |accessdate=1 October 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131206195827/http://www.justice.gov/usao/eousa/foia_reading_room/usam/title9/crm00611.htm |archive-date=2013-12-06 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[International Criminal Court]] (ICC): A relatively recent development in international law, the ICC (or ICCt) is the first permanent international criminal court established to ensure that the gravest international crimes ([[war crime]]s, [[genocide]], other [[crimes against humanity]], etc.) do not go unpunished. The [[Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court]] establishing the ICC and its jurisdiction was signed by 139 national governments, of which 100 ratified it by October 2005.
* [[World Bank]]/[[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF): [[United Nations Monetary and Financial Conference|Formed together]] in July 1944 at the [[Mount Washington Hotel]] in [[Bretton Woods, New Hampshire]], [[United States]] to foster global monetary cooperation and to fight poverty by financially assisting states in need. These institutions have been criticized as simply oligarchic hegemonies of the Great Powers, most notably the United States, which maintains the only veto, for instance, in the International Monetary Fund.
* [[World Trade Organization]] (WTO): Sets the rules of international trade. It has a semi-legislative body (the General Council, reaching decisions by consensus) and a judicial body (the Dispute Settlement Body). Another influential economical international organization is the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] (OECD), with membership of 30 democratic members.
* [[G7]]: A group consisting of Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom, and the United States. The leaders of the G7 countries meet annually in person to coordinate their policies in confronting [[global issue]]s, such as poverty, terrorism, infectious diseases, and climate change.
* [[G20]]: An association of twenty developing and established nations and entities, including the European Union.

In addition to the formal, or semi-formal, international organizations and laws mentioned above, many other mechanisms act to regulate human activities across national borders. In particular, international trade in goods, services and currencies (the "[[global market]]") has a tremendous impact on the lives of people in almost all parts of the world, creating deep interdependency amongst nations (see [[globalization]]). Trans-national (or multi-national) [[corporations]], some with resources exceeding those available to most governments, govern activities of people on a global scale. The rapid increase in the volume of trans-border digital communications and mass-media distribution (e.g., [[Internet]], [[satellite television]]) has allowed information, ideas, and opinions to rapidly spread across the world, creating a complex web of international coordination and influence, mostly outside the control of any formal organizations or laws. A proactive form of globalization is emerging, spawned by international corporations that wish to loosen trade restrictions. It is the global financial firms that have been the most eager proponents of this expansion. A group of advocates from different parts of the world had been pushing for an integrated global society as envisioned in the Globalist Manifesto which is the foundation of globalism ideology.&lt;ref name="Falk"&gt;Falk, Avner.

{{Main|Regional organization|Supranational union}}

The only union generally recognized as having achieved the status of a supranational union is the [[European Union]].&lt;ref name="Bauböck-2007"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bauböck|first=Rainer|date=2007|title=Why European Citizenship?

There are a number of other regional organizations that, while not supranational unions, have adopted or intend to adopt policies that may lead to a similar sort of integration in some respects.

===European Union===
[[File:Locator European Union.svg|thumb|right|150px|Map of [[European Union]] nations]]

The most relevant model{{peacock-inline|date=July 2018}} for the incremental establishment of a global federation may be the [[European Union]] (EU), which politically unites a large group of widely diverse (and some formerly hostile) nations spread over a large geographical area and encompassing over 500 million people. Although the EU is still evolving, it already has many attributes of a federal government such as open internal borders, a directly elected parliament, a court system, an official currency ([[Euro]]), and a centralized economic policy. A treaty change would be needed to allow for enlargement of the Union beyond the European continent.&lt;ref name="gissac1"&gt;Bart Gissac "Idées pour l'Union", ''[[Luxemburger Wort]]'', 5 May 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

The EU's example is being followed by the [[African Union]], the [[Union of South American Nations]], the [[Organization of Central American States]], and the [[Association of Southeast Asian Nations]]. A multitude of [[trade bloc|regional associations]], aggregating most nations of the world, are at different stages of development towards a growing extent of economic, and sometimes political, integration. The European Union consists of twenty-eight European states.  It has developed a "single market" which allows people of different countries to travel from state to state without a passport.  This also includes the same policies when it comes to trading.  The European Union is said to have 26% of the world's money.  Not all EU member states use the Euro; the United Kingdom, for example, retains the [[pound sterling]].  Where the Euro is in place, it allows easy access for the free circulation of trade goods.  Tariffs are also the same for each country allowing no unfair practices within the union.

===NATO===
[[File:North Atlantic Treaty Organization (orthographic projection).svg|thumb|150px|right|Map of [[NATO]] nations]]

The [[North Atlantic Treaty Organization]] (NATO) is an [[Intergovernmental organization|intergovernmental]] [[military alliance]] based on the [[North Atlantic Treaty]] which was signed on 4&amp;nbsp;April 1949. The organization constitutes a system of [[collective defence]] whereby its member states agree to mutual defense in response to an attack by any external party. NATO's headquarters are in [[Brussels]], Belgium, one of the 28 member states across North America and Europe, the newest of which, Albania and Croatia, joined in April 2009. An additional 22&amp;nbsp;countries participate in NATO's "[[Partnership for Peace]]", with 15&amp;nbsp;other countries involved in institutionalized dialogue programs. The combined military spending of all NATO members constitutes over 70% of [[List of countries by military expenditures|the world's defence spending]].&lt;ref name="sipri1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://milexdata.sipri.org/ |title=The SIPRI Military Expenditure Database |publisher=Milexdata.sipri.org |accessdate=22 August 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100328072123/http://milexdata.sipri.org/ |archivedate=March 28, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===CARICOM===
[[File:CARICOM Map 2010-2.png|thumb|150px|right|Map of [[CARICOM]] nations]]

The [[Caribbean Community]] (CARICOM), is an organization of 15 Caribbean nations and dependencies. CARICOM's main purpose is to promote economic integration and cooperation among its members, to ensure that the benefits of integration are equitably shared and to coordinate foreign policy. Its major activities involve coordinating economic policies and development planning; devising and instituting special projects for the less-developed countries within its jurisdiction; operating as a regional single market for many of its members [[CARICOM Single Market and Economy]] (CSME); and handling regional trade disputes.

Since the establishment of CARICOM by the mainly English Creole-speaking parts of the Caribbean region CARICOM has become multilingual in practice with the addition of Dutch speaking [[Suriname]] on 4 July 1995 (although the lingua franca in Suriname is Sranan Tongo, which is an English-based Creole like the languages spoken in much of the rest of CARICOM) and [[Haiti]], where French and Haitian Creole are spoken, on 2 July 2002. In 2001, the heads of government signed a Revised [[Treaty of Chaguaramas]] in [[Trinidad and Tobago]], clearing the way for the transformation of the idea for a [[Common Market]] aspect of CARICOM into instead a Caribbean Single Market and Economy. Part of the revised treaty among member states includes the establishment and implementation of the [[Caribbean Court of Justice]] (CCJ).

===African Union===
[[File:African Union (orthographic projection).svg|thumb|left|150px|right|Map of [[African Union]] nations]]

The [[African Union]] (AU) is an organisation consisting of all the 55 [[Africa]]n states of the continent and African waters. Established on July 9, 2002, the AU was formed as a successor to the amalgamated [[African Economic Community]] (AEC) and the [[Organisation of African Unity]] (OAU). Eventually, the AU aims to have a single currency and a single integrated defence force, as well as other institutions of state, including a cabinet for the AU Head of State.{{Citation needed|date = July 2014}} The purpose of the union is to help secure Africa's [[democracy]], [[human rights]], and a [[Economy of Africa|sustainable economy]], especially by bringing an end to intra-African conflict and creating an effective common market.

Projects for improved economic and political cooperation are also happening at a regional level with the [[Arab Maghreb Union]], the [[Economic Community of West African States]], the [[Economic Community of Central African States]] the [[Southern African Development Community]] and the [[East African Community]].

The [[Commonwealth of Independent States]] is comparable to a [[confederation]] similar to the original [[European Community]]. Although the CIS has few supranational powers, it is more than a purely symbolic organization, possessing coordinating powers in the realm of trade, finance, lawmaking, and security.  It has also promoted cooperation on [[democratization]] and cross-border [[crime prevention]]. As a regional organization, CIS participates in [[Peacekeeping|UN peacekeeping forces]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.un.org/Depts/dpko/lessons/Regional%20Organizations.pdf |title= Regional organizations in UN peacekeeping activities |access-date= 2017-06-29 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20090807012106/http://www.un.org/Depts/dpko/lessons/Regional%20Organizations.pdf |archive-date= 2009-08-07 |dead-url= no |df=  }}&amp;nbsp;{{small|(354 KB)}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the members of the CIS have established the [[Eurasian Economic Community]] with the aim of creating a full-fledged [[common market]].

===Organisation of Islamic Cooperation===
[[Image:OIC map.png|thumb|left|Map of Organisation of Islamic Cooperation members (green) and observers (red)]]

The [[Organisation of Islamic Cooperation]] (OIC) is an [[international organisation]] with a permanent delegation to the [[United Nations]]. It groups 57 member states, from the [[Middle East]], [[Africa]], [[Central Asia]], [[Caucasus]], [[Balkans]], [[Southeast Asia]] and [[South Asia]]. The organization claims it represents the Global Islamic World (''[[ummah]]'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oic-oci.org/page_detail.asp?p_id=52|title="The Organization has the singular honor to galvanize the Ummah into a unified body and have actively represented the Muslims by espousing all causes close to the hearts of over 1.5 billion Muslims of the world."|author=|date=|website=oic-oci.org|accessdate=27 March 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150926165053/http://www.oic-oci.org/page_detail.asp?p_id=52|archive-date=2015-09-26|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The official languages of the organisation are [[Arabic language|Arabic]], [[English language|English]] and [[French language|French]].

Since the 19th century, many [[Muslims]] have aspired to uniting the Muslim ''ummah'' to serve their common political, economic and social interests. Despite the presence of secularist, nationalist and socialist ideologies in modern Muslim states, they have cooperated to form the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation. The formation of the OIC happened in the backdrop of the loss of Muslim holy sites in Jerusalem. The final cause sufficiently compelled leaders of Muslim nations to meet in Rabat to establish the OIC on September 25, 1969.&lt;ref name=EIMW&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.oic-oci.org/page_detail.asp?p_id=52 |title={title} |access-date=2010-03-18 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100314053224/http://www.oic-oci.org/page_detail.asp?p_id=52 |archive-date=2010-03-14 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{POV statement|date=January 2013}}

According to its charter, the OIC aims to preserve Islamic social and economic values; promote solidarity amongst member states; increase cooperation in social, economic, cultural, scientific, and political areas; uphold international peace and security; and advance education, particularly in the fields of science and technology.&lt;ref name=EIMW/&gt;

On August 5, 1990, 45 foreign ministers of the OIC adopted the [[Cairo Declaration on Human Rights in Islam]] to serve as a guidance for the member states in the matters of human rights in as much as they are compatible with the [[Sharia]], or Quranic Law.&lt;ref name=CDHRII&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www1.umn.edu/humanrts/instree/cairodeclaration.html|title=Cairo Declaration on Human Rights in Islam|date=August 5, 1990|access-date=2010-03-18|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100603093031/http://www1.umn.edu/humanrts/instree/cairodeclaration.html|archive-date=2010-06-03|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Turkic Council===

The [[Turkic Council]] is an international organization comprising Turkic countries. Since 1992, the ''Turkic Language Speaking Countries Summit'' has been organizing amongst the Turkic countries. On October 3, 2009, four of these countries signed the Nahcivan Agreement. The organizational center is [[İstanbul]]. Additionally, the [[Joint Administration of Turkic Arts and Culture]] was founded in [[Almaty]] in 1992 and the ''Turkic Countries Parliamentarian Assembly'' was founded in [[Baku]] in 1998. All of these organizations were coopted into the Turkic Council. The Turkic Council has an operational style similar to organization like the [[Arab League]]. The member countries are [[Azerbaijan]], [[Kazakhstan]], [[Kyrgyzstan]] and [[Turkey]]. The remaining two Turkic states, [[Turkmenistan]] and [[Uzbekistan]] are not currently official members of the council. However, due to their neutral stance, they participate in international relations and are strongly predicted to be future members of the council. The idea of setting up this cooperative council was first put forward by Kazakh President [[Nursultan Nazarbayev]] back in 2006.
