{{distinguish|Alatri|Alastrim}}
'''Alatrism''' or '''alatry''' ([[Greek language|Greek]]: from the [[privative a|privative ἀ-]] + λατρεία (''latreia'') = [[worship]]) is the recognition of the existence of one or more gods, but with a deliberate lack of worship of any deity. Typically, it includes the belief that religious rituals have no [[supernatural]] significance, and that gods ignore all prayers and worship.

Alatrism is not the same as [[Deism]], which holds that one or more gods may exist, but do not intervene. Deism does not exclude worship, and alatrism does not exclude the possibility that gods intervene; alatrists usually believe that any divine intervention occurs only for the deity's/deities' own reasons, unconnected to any encouragement by devotees.

Historical alatrist groups include the [[Neopythagoreanism|Neopythagoreans]].

'''Antinatalism''', or '''anti-natalism''', is a philosophical position that assigns a negative [[value (ethics)|value]] to [[birth]]. Antinatalists argue that people should refrain from procreation because it is [[morality|morally]] [[evil|bad]] (some also recognize the procreation of other [[sentience|sentient beings]] as morally bad). In scholarly and in literary writings, various [[ethics|ethical]] foundations have been adduced for antinatalism.&lt;ref&gt;K. Akerma, ''Antinatalismus – Ein Handbuch'', epubli, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the earliest surviving formulations of the idea that it would be better not to have been born come from ancient Greece.&lt;ref&gt;W. Tatarkiewicz, ''O szczęściu'' (''On Happiness''), Warszawa: Państwowe Wydawnictwo Naukowe, 1979, pp. 420-421.&lt;/ref&gt; The term "antinatalism" is in opposition to the term "[[natalism]]" or "pro-natalism", and was used probably for the first time as the name of the position by [[Théophile de Giraud]] (born 1968) in his book ''L'art de guillotiner les procréateurs: Manifeste anti-nataliste''.&lt;ref&gt;K. Akerma, ''Antinatalismus – Ein Handbuch'', epubli, 2017, p. 301.&lt;/ref&gt;

== In religions ==

The teaching of the [[Buddha]] (c. 400 BCE) is interpreted by [[Hari Singh Gour]] (1870–1949) as follows:

{{blockquote|Buddha states his propositions in the pedantic style of his age.  He throws them into a form of [[polysyllogism|sorites]]; but, as such, it is logically faulty and all he wishes to convey is this:  Oblivious of the suffering to which life is subject, man begets children, and is thus the cause of old age and death.  If he would only realize what suffering he would add to by his act, he would desist from the procreation of children; and so stop the operation of old age and death.&lt;ref&gt;H. Singh Gour, ''The Spirit of Buddhism'', Whitefish, Montana: Kessinger Publishing, 2005, pp. 286–288.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The [[Marcionites]] believed that the visible world is an evil creation of a crude, cruel, jealous, angry [[demiurge]],  [[Yahweh]]. According to this teaching, people should oppose him, abandon his world, not create people, and trust in the good God of mercy, foreign and distant.&lt;ref&gt;H. Jonas, ''The Gnostic Religion: The Message of the Alien God and the Beginnings of Christianity'', Boston: Beacon Press, 1958, pp. 144–145.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Clement of Alexandria, ''Stromateis, Books 1–3 (The Fathers of the Church, volume 85)'', Washington D.C.: CUA Press, 2010, pp. 263–271.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;P. Karavites, ''Evil, Freedom, and the Road to Perfection in Clement of Alexandria'', Leiden: Brill, 1999, p. 94.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Encratites]] observed that birth leads to death.  In order to conquer death, people should desist from procreation:  "not produce fresh fodder for death".&lt;ref&gt;P. Brown, ''The Body and Society:  Men, Women, and Sexual Renunciation in Early Christianity'', New York: Columbia University Press, 1988, p. 96.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Clement of Alexandria, ''Stromateis'', op. cit., pp. 295–296.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;G. Quispel, ''Gnostica, Judaica, Catholica:  Collected Essays of Gilles Quispel'', Leiden: Brill, 2008, p. 228.&lt;/ref&gt;

Elliott, ''Spiritual Marriage: Sexual Abstinence in Medieval Wedlock'', Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1995, pp. 133–134.&lt;/ref&gt; believed that procreation sentences the soul to imprisonment in evil matter. They saw procreation as an instrument of an [[Dualistic cosmology#In Christianity|evil god]], demiurge, or of [[Satan]] that imprisons the divine element in matter and thus causes the divine element to suffer.

== Peter Wessel Zapffe ==

[[Peter Wessel Zapffe]] (1899–1990) viewed humans as a biological paradox. [[Consciousness]] has become over-evolved in humans, thereby making us incapable of functioning normally like other animals: cognition gives us more than we can carry. Our frailness and insignificance in the cosmos is visible to us. We want to live, and yet because of how we have evolved, we are the only species whose members are conscious that they are destined to die. We are able to analyze the past and the future, both our situation and of others, to imagine the suffering of billions of people who lived in the past and today, and also of other living beings, to feel [[compassion]] for their suffering. We yearn for justice and meaning in a world where neither occur. This ensures that the lives of conscious individuals are tragic. We have desires: spiritual needs which reality is unable to satisfy, and our species still exists only because we limit our awareness of what that reality actually entails. Human existence amounts to a tangled network of defense mechanisms, which can be observed both individually and socially, in our everyday behavior patterns. According to Zapffe, humanity should cease this self-deception, and the natural consequence would be its [[extinction]] by abstaining from procreation.&lt;ref name=autoname1&gt;P.W. Zapffe, ''The Last Messiah'', Philosophy Now, 2004, number 45, pp. 35–39.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;P. W. Zapffe, ''Om det tragiske'', Oslo: Pax Forlag, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;P. W. Zapffe, H.

== Negative ethics ==

[[Julio Cabrera (philosopher)|Julio Cabrera]] proposes a concept of "negative ethics" in opposition to what he views as "affirmative" ethics which affirm [[dasein|Being]].&lt;ref&gt;J. Cabrera, ''Projeto de Ética Negativa'', São Paulo: Edicões Mandacaru, 1989 (second edition: ''A Ética e Suas Negações, Não nascer, suicídio e pequenos assassinatos'', Rio De Janeiro: Rocco, 2011). [https://misantropiaemelancolia.wordpress.com/2017/10/24/project-of-negative-ethics/] English translation of the first chapter.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="autoname2"&gt;[http://repositorio.unb.br/bitstream/10482/17430/3/Livro_CritiqueAffirmativeMorality.pdf] J. Cabrera, ''A critique of affirmative morality (A reflection on death, birth and the value of life)'', Brasília: Julio Cabrera Editions, 2014 (English edition). J. Cabrera, ''Crítica de la moral afirmativa: Una reflexión sobre nacimiento, muerte y valor de la vida'', Barcelona: Gedisa, 1996 (original Spanish edition, second edition in 2014).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;J. Cabrera (editor), ''Ética Negativa: problemas e discussões'', Goiânia: UFG, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://repositorio.unb.br/bitstream/10482/15274/1/LIVRO_PorqueTeAmo.pdf] J. Cabrera, T. Lenharo di Santis, ''Porque te amo, Não nascerás!: Nascituri te salutant'', Brasília: LGE, 2009. 
[https://misantropiaemelancolia.wordpress.com/2017/09/28/first-chapter-of-nascituri-te-salutant/] English translation.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;J. Cabrera, ''Mal-estar e moralidade: situação humana, ética e procriação responsável'', Brasília: UnB, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; He describes procreation as a manipulation, as a harmful act, and as sending a human being into a painful and dangerous situation without their consent. For Cabrera, this situation, human life, is "structurally negative" in that its constitutive components are inherently adverse. The most prominent of these components are, according to him, the following: A) At birth, the human being gains a decreasing (or "waning") Being in the sense of a Being that begins to end from its mere emergence, following a single and irreversible direction of decay and decline, and whose complete consummation can occur at any moment. B) The human being is affected, from the beginning of its emergence, by three types of friction: [[physical pain]] (in the form of [[disease|illnesses]], [[accident|accidents]] and catastrophes to which it is always exposed); discouragement (a category that encompasses phenomena such as lack of will, [[fatigue]], lack of strength, feelings of meaninglessness, lack of [[motivation]], [[boredom]] and [[depression (mood)|depression]]); and the exposure to the aggressive action of other humans (in the form of [[discrimination]], [[gossip]], [[slander]], [[social exclusion|exclusion]], [[persecution]], [[injustice]], physical and psychological [[torture]] and even destruction), they too are subjected to the three types of friction. C) The human being is equipped with mechanisms of creation of positive values of all kinds (moral, aesthetic, religious, scientific, erotic, artistic, etc.) that work as defense against A and B, mechanisms that the human must keep constantly active against the advances of the decreasing emergence and its three types of friction. Cabrera calls the set of these characteristics A-C "terminality of Being".

According to Cabrera, all positive values that appear within human life are reactive and palliative; they are introduced by the permanent, anxious and uncertain struggle against the decreasing and attrited Being gained at birth, and are ultimately defeated by its full consummation. Cabrera points out that a huge number of humans around the world cannot withstand this steep struggle against the terminal structure of their Being, which leads to destructive consequences for them and others: suicides, major or minor nervous diseases, or mass aggression. He accepts that life may, under normal circumstances and even in abnormal and dramatic circumstances, be bearable, and also that humans are capable, through their merits and efforts, to make life not only bearable, but even very pleasant (though, for example, it may become unbearable in the face of a serious illness or great social injustice, and not everyone's life, because the price of the pleasant life of some is always the unpleasant life of others), however, he considers it problematic to procreate someone so that they can try to make their life pleasant by struggling against the difficult and oppressive situation we give them by procreating. It seems more reasonable, in Cabrera's view, simply not to put them in the situation to which they will have to react, when its results are always uncertain. He concludes that: "whatever we say to ourselves so that we can continue to live, it has no sense for someone who does not yet exist".

Cabrera regards procreation as an [[ontology|ontological]] and total manipulation: one's very Being is manufactured and used, so in contrast to intra-worldly cases where someone is placed in a harmful situation, in the case of procreation no chance of defense against that act is even available. In addition, Cabrera points out that the manipulation of procreation is generally not limited to the act of creation itself, but is continued in the process of raising the child, where they are shaped according to the preferences of the parents and for their satisfaction. He emphasizes that although manipulation is unavoidable in procreation, it is perfectly possible not to procreate, and thus the child would not be harmed in any way. According to Cabrera, in ethics, also in affirmative ethics, there is one overarching concept which he calls the "Fundamental Ethical Articulation", in short "FEA": the consideration of other people's interests, the non-manipulation and non-harm of others. Procreation for him is an obvious violation of FEA. In his view, values included in the FEA are already widely accepted by affirmative ethics, and if approached [[hypocrisy|radically]], they should lead to the refusal of procreation. Cabrera also argues that procreation is a violation of [[autonomy]] because we lack a human's consent when we act on this human's behalf through procreation, and that a [[rational agent]], having reliable information about the human situation and the ability to speak about its possible coming into existence, might not want to be born and experience the harms associated with existence (this is a reference to a [[thought experiment]] proposed by [[R. M. Hare|Richard Hare]], who claims that birth would be undoubtedly chosen). Cabrera distinguishes between "structural death" (SD, or simply mortality), the process initiated by birth, and "punctual death" (PD), the moment one ceases to exist. In his view, recognizing death (in the sense of SD) as bad and regretting having to die, should be identical to recognizing birth as bad and regretting being born, since it is not possible to be born in a non-mortal way.

In the moral problem of procreation, Cabrera attaches the utmost importance to what he describes as "moral impediment". According to negative ethics, humans are "morally disqualified": we are not able to act morally towards everyone; taking into account someone's interests and being moral towards them, always coincides with not taking into account the interests of many others and not being moral towards these others. This impediment does not occur because of the intrinsic "evil" of human nature, but because of the structural situation in which human has always been. In this situation, human beings are cornered by various kinds of pain, there is a scarcity of time and space to lead lives, and different interests often conflict with each other. We do not have to have bad intentions to treat others with disregard; we are compelled to do so in order to survive, pursue our projects and escape from suffering. The impossibility of being moral is for Cabrera the worst thing in human life and in procreation: by procreating, one creates another human who will not be able to live morally. Cabrera also draws attention to the fact that life is associated with the constant risk of experiencing strong physical pain, for example as a result of a serious illness, and maintains that the mere existence of such possibility impedes us morally, as well as that because of it, we can at any time lose, as a result of its realization, the possibility of a dignified, moral functioning even to a minimal extent. Cabrera also considers the issue of being a creator in relation to [[theodicy]] and argues that just as it is impossible to defend the idea of a good God as creator, it is also impossible to defend the idea of a good man as creator. In parenthood, the human parent imitates the divine parent, in the sense that education could be understood as a form of the pursuit of "salvation", the "right path" for a child. However, a human being could decide that it is better not to suffer at all than to suffer and be offered the later possibility of salvation from suffering. In Cabrera's opinion, evil is associated not with the [[nothing|lack of being]], but with the suffering and dying of what is alive. So, on the contrary, evil is only and obviously associated with [[being]].

== Kantian imperative ==

Julio Cabrera,&lt;ref&gt;[http://repositorio.unb.br/bitstream/10482/15274/1/LIVRO_PorqueTeAmo.pdf] J. Cabrera, T. Lenharo di Santis, ''Porque...'', op. cit, pp. 52–67.&lt;/ref&gt; [[David Benatar]] (born 1966),&lt;ref&gt;D. Benatar, ''Better Never to Have Been: The Harm of Coming into Existence'', Oxford: Clarendon Press, 2006, pp. 129–131.&lt;/ref&gt; and Karim Akerma&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tabvlarasa.de/41/Akerma.php] K. Akerma, ''Theodicy shading off into Anthropodicy in Milton, Twain and Kant'', Tabula Rasa. Die Kulturzeitung aus Mitteldeutschland, 2010, number 49.&lt;/ref&gt; all argue that procreation is contrary to  [[Immanuel Kant]]'s practical imperative (according to Kant, a man should never be used as a means to an end, but always be an end in himself). They argue that a person can be created for the sake of his parents or other people, but that it is impossible to create someone for his own good; and that therefore, following Kant's recommendation, we should not create new people. Heiko Puls argues that Kant's considerations regarding parental duties and human procreation in general imply arguments for an ethically justified antinatalism. Kant, however, according to Puls, rejects this position in his [[teleology]] for meta-ethical reasons.&lt;ref&gt;H. Puls, ''Kant’s Justification of Parental Duties'', Kantian Review 21 (1), 2016, pp. 53–75.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Negative utilitarianism ==

[[Negative utilitarianism]] argues that minimizing suffering has greater moral importance than maximizing happiness.

[[Hermann Vetter]] (born 1933) agrees with the [[The Asymmetry (population ethics)|assumptions]] of [[Jan Narveson]] (born 1936):&lt;ref&gt;J. Narveson, ''Utilitarianism and New Generations'', Mind 1967, LXXVI (301), pp. 62-67.&lt;/ref&gt;
{{ordered list
| There is no moral obligation to produce a child even if we could be sure that it will be very happy throughout its life.
| There is a moral obligation not to produce a child if it can be foreseen that it will be unhappy.}}
However, he disagrees with the conclusion that Narveson draws:
{{ordered list|start=3
| In general {{ndash}} if it can be foreseen neither that the child will be unhappy nor that it will bring disutility upon others {{ndash}} there is no duty to have or not to have a child.}}

Instead, he presents the following decision theoretic matrix:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! !! child will be more or less happy !! child will be more or less unhappy
|-
| produce the child || no duty fulfilled or violated || duty violated
|-
| do not produce the child || no duty fulfilled or violated || duty fulfilled
|}

Based on this, he concludes that we should not create people:&lt;ref name=autoname3&gt;H. Vetter, ''The production of children as a problem for utilitarian ethics'', Inquiry 12, 1969, pp. 445–447.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;H. Vetter, ''Utilitarianism and New Generations'', Mind, 1971, LXXX (318), pp. 301–302.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|It is seen immediately that the act "do not produce the child" dominates the act "produce the child" because it has equally good consequences as the other act in one case and better consequences in the other. So it is to be preferred to the other act as long as we cannot exclude with certainty the possibility that the child will be more or less unhappy; and we never can. So we have, instead of (3), the far-reaching consequence: (3') In any case, it is morally preferable not to produce a child.}}

Karim Akerma claims we should refrain from procreation because the good things in life do not compensate for the bad things. First and foremost, the best things do not compensate for the worst things such as, for example, the experience of unspeakable pain, the agonies of the wounded, sick or dying.&lt;ref&gt;K. Akerma, ''Soll eine Menschheit sein? Eine fundamentalethische Frage'', Cuxhaven-Dartford: Traude Junghans, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;K. Akerma, ''Verebben der Menschheit?: Neganthropie und Anthropodizee'', Freiburg im Breisgau: Verlag Karl Alber, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

Bruno Constestabile cites the story "[[The Ones Who Walk Away from Omelas]]" by [[Ursula K. Le Guin]]. In this story, the existence of the utopian city of Omelas and the good fortune of its inhabitants depend on the suffering of one child tortured in an isolated place and who can not be helped. The majority accepts this state of affairs and stay in the city, but there are those who do not agree with it, who do not want to participate in it and thus they "walk away from Omelas". Constestabile draws a parallel here: for Omelas to exist, the child must be tortured, and in the same way, the existence of our world is related to the fact that someone is constantly harmed. According to the author, antinatalists can be seen just as "the ones who walk away from Omelas", who do not accept such a world, and who do not want to put their hands in it. He poses the question: is all happiness able to compensate for the extreme suffering of even one person?&lt;ref name=autoname4&gt;B. Contestabile, ''The Denial of the World from an Impartial View'',
Contemporary Buddhism: An Interdisciplinary Journal, volume 17, issue 1, Taylor and Francis, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

== David Benatar ==

[[David Benatar]] argues that there is a crucial asymmetry between pleasure and pain:
# the presence of pain is bad;
# the presence of pleasure is good;
# the absence of pain is good, even if that good is not enjoyed by anyone;
# the absence of pleasure is not bad unless there is somebody for whom this absence is a deprivation.&lt;ref&gt;D. Benatar, ''Why it is Better Never to Come Into Existence'', American Philosophical Quarterly, 1997, volume 34, number 3, pp. 345–355.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;D. Benatar, ''Better...'', op. cit., pp. 30–40.&lt;/ref&gt;

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Scenario A (X exists) !! Scenario B (X never exists)
|-
| (1) Presence of pain (Bad) || (3) Absence of pain (Good)
|-
| (2) Presence of pleasure (Good) || (4) Absence of pleasure (Not bad)
|}

Regarding procreation, the argument follows that coming into existence generates both good and bad experiences, pain and pleasure, whereas not coming into existence entails neither pain nor pleasure. The absence of pain is good, the absence of pleasure is not bad. Therefore, the ethical choice is weighed in favor of non-procreation.

Benatar explains the above asymmetry using four other asymmetries that he considers quite plausible:
# We have a moral obligation not to create unhappy people, and we have no moral obligation to create happy people. The reason why there is a moral obligation not to create unhappy people is that we believe the presence of pain is bad for those who are hurt, and the absence of pain is good also when there is no someone who is experiencing this good. By contrast, the reason for which there is no moral obligation to create happy people is that although the feeling of pleasure would be good for them, the absence of pleasure when they do not come into existence will not be bad, because there will be no one who will be deprived of this good.
# It is strange to mention the interests of a potential child as a reason why we decide to create it, and it is not strange to mention the interests of a potential child as a reason why we decide not to create it. That the child may be happy is not a morally important reason to create it. By contrast, that the child may be unhappy is an important moral reason to not create it. If the absence of pleasure is bad even if someone does not exist to experience its absence, we would have a significant moral reason to create a child, and to create as many children as possible. If, however, the absence of pain wouldn't be good even if someone would not experience this good, we would not have a significant moral reason not to create a child.
# Someday we can regret for the sake of the good of a man whose existence was conditional on our decision, that we created him {{ndash}} a man can be unhappy and the presence of his pain would be a bad thing. But we will never feel regret for the sake of the good of a man whose existence was conditional on our decision, that we did not create him {{ndash}} a man will not be deprived of happiness, because he will never exist, and the absence of happiness will not be bad, because there will be no one who will be deprived of this good. 
# We feel sadness by the fact that somewhere people come into existence and suffer, and we feel no sadness by the fact that somewhere people did not come into existence and in this place there are happy people. When we know that somewhere people came into existence and suffer, we feel compassion. The fact that on some deserted island or planet people did not come into existence and suffer is good. This is because the absence of pain is good even when there is not someone who is experiencing this good. On the other hand, we do not feel sadness by the fact that on some deserted island or planet people did not come into existence and are not happy. This is because the absence of pleasure is bad only when someone exists to be deprived of this good.&lt;ref&gt;D. Benatar, ''Better...'', op. cit., pp. 30–57.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Benatar, by creating a child, we are responsible not only for this child's suffering, but we may also be co-responsible for the suffering of further offspring of this child:

{{quote|Assuming that each couple has three children, an original pair's cumulative descendants over ten generations amount to 88,572 people. That constitutes a lot of pointless, avoidable suffering. To be sure, full responsibility for it all does not lie with the original couple because each new generation faces the choice of whether to continue that line of descendants. Nevertheless, they bear some responsibility for the generations that ensue. If one does not desist from having children, one can hardly expect one's descendants to do so.&lt;ref&gt;D. Benatar, ''Better...'', op. cit., pp. 6–7.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Benatar cites statistics showing where the creation of people leads. It is estimated that:
* more than fifteen million people are thought to have died from natural disasters in the last 1,000 years,
* approximately 20,000 people die every day from hunger,
* an estimated 840 million people suffer from hunger and malnutrition,
* between 541 CE and 1912, it is estimated that over 102 million people succumbed to plague,
* the 1918 influenza epidemic killed 50 million people,
* 11 million people die every year from infectious diseases,
* malignant neoplasms take more than a further 7 million lives each year,
* approximately 3.5 million people die every year in accidents,
* approximately 56.5 million people died in 2001, that is more than 107 people per minute,
* before the twentieth century over 133 million people were killed in mass killings,
* in the first 88 years of the twentieth century 170 million (and possibly as many as 360 million) people were shot, beaten, tortured, knifed, burned, starved, frozen, crushed, or worked to death; buried alive, drowned, hanged, bombed, or killed in any other of the myriad ways governments have inflicted death on unarmed, helpless citizens and foreigners,
* there were 1.6 million conflict-related deaths in the sixteenth century, 6.1 million in the seventeenth century, 7 million in the eighteenth, 19.4 million in the nineteenth, and 109.7 million in the twentieth,
* war-related injuries led to 310,000 deaths in 2000,
* about 40 million children are maltreated each year,
* more than 100 million currently living women and girls have been subjected to genital cutting,
* 815,000 people are thought to have committed suicide in 2000&lt;ref&gt;D. Benatar, ''Better...'', op. cit., pp. 88–92.&lt;/ref&gt; (currently, it is estimated that someone commits suicide every 40 seconds, more than 800,000 people per year).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.iasp.info/wspd/2016_wspd.php] International Association for Suicide Prevention, World Suicide Prevention Day.&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to the [[philanthropic]] arguments, Benatar also posits that another path to antinatalism is the [[misanthropic]] argument,&lt;ref&gt;D. Benatar, D. Wasserman, ''Debating Procreation: Is It Wrong To Reproduce?'', Oxford University Press, New York 2015, pp. 87-121.&lt;/ref&gt; which may be described as follows:

{{quote|Another route to anti-natalism is via what I call a "misanthropic" argument. According to this argument humans are a deeply flawed and a destructive species that is responsible for the suffering and deaths of billions of other humans and non-human animals. If that level of destruction were caused by another species we would rapidly recommend that new members of that species not be brought into existence.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.philosophy.uct.ac.za/sites/default/files/image_tool/images/160/We%20Are%20Creatures%20That%20Should%20Not%20Exist%20The%20Theory%20of%20Anti-Natalism%20%28The%20Critique%2015%20July%202015%29.pdf] ''"We Are Creatures That Should Not Exist": The Theory of Anti-Natalism'', The Critique, July 15, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

== Harming other animals ==

David Benatar,&lt;ref&gt;D. Benatar, ''Better...'', op. cit., p. 109.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;D. Benatar, D. Wasserman, ''Debating...'', op. cit., pp. 93– 99.&lt;/ref&gt; Gunter Bleibohm (born 1947),&lt;ref&gt;G. Bleibohm, ''Fluch der Geburt – Thesen einer Überlebensethik'', Landau-Godramstein: Gegensich, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Gerald Harrison and Julia Tanner,&lt;ref&gt;G. Harrison, J. Tanner, ''Better Not To Have Children'', Think, 2011, volume 10, issue 27, pp. 113–121.&lt;/ref&gt; are attentive to harm caused to other sentient beings by humans. They would say that billions of non-human animals are abused and slaughtered each year by our species for the production of animal products, for experimentation and after the experiments, when they are no longer needed, as a result of the [[destruction of habitats]] or other environmental damage and for sadistic pleasure. They tend to agree with [[animal rights]] thinkers that the harm we do them is immoral. They consider the human species the most destructive on the planet, arguing that without new humans, there will be no harm caused to other sentient beings by new humans.

Some antinatalists are also [[vegetarians]] or [[vegans]] for moral reasons, and postulate that such views should complement each other as having a common denominator: not causing harm to other sentient beings.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.pro-iure-animalis.de/index.php/antinatalismus/articles/ist-der-vegetarismus-ein-antinatalismus.html] K. Akerma, ''Ist der Vegetarismus ein Antinatalismus?'', Pro iure animalis, March 24, 2014. [http://akerma.de/Is%20Vegetarianism%20an%20Antinatalism.pdf] English translation.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.marieclaire.com/culture/a14751412/antinatalism/]V. Pelley, ''This Extreme Sect of Vegans Thinks Your Baby Will Destroy the Planet'', Marie Claire, January 29, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; This attitude was already present in Manicheism and Catharism.&lt;ref&gt;K. Akerma, ''Antinatalismus – Ein Handbuch'', epubli, 2017, p. 305.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Impact on the environment ==

Volunteers of the [[Voluntary Human Extinction Movement]] argue that human activity is the primary cause of [[environmental degradation]], and therefore the refraining from reproduction is "the humanitarian alternative to human disasters".&lt;ref&gt;V. Baird, ''The No-nonsense Guide to World Population'', Oxford: New Internationalist, 2011, p. 119.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rm1QojjwGdo] An NBC interview with Les U. Knight.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://vhemt.org] The official Voluntary Human Extinction Movement website.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Adoption instead of procreation ==

Herman Vetter,&lt;ref name="autoname3" /&gt; Théophile de Giraud,&lt;ref&gt;[http://theophiledegiraud.e-monsite.com/medias/files/manifeste-anti-nataliste.pdf] T. de Giraud, ''L'art de guillotiner les procréateurs: Manifeste anti-nataliste'', Nancy: Le Mort-Qui-Trompe, 2006, p. 51.&lt;/ref&gt; Tina Rulli&lt;ref&gt;T. Rulli, ''The Ethics of Procreation and Adoption'', Philosophy Compass 11/6, 2016, pp. 305–315.&lt;/ref&gt; and Karim Akerma&lt;ref&gt;K. Akerma, ''Antinatalismus...'', op. cit., p. 74.&lt;/ref&gt; argue that presently rather than engaging in the morally problematic act of procreation, one could do good by [[adoption|adopting]] already existing children. De Giraud emphasizes that, across the world, there are millions of existing children who need care.

== Realism ==

Some antinatalists believe that most people do not evaluate reality accurately, which affects the desire to have children.

Peter Wessel Zapffe identifies four repressive mechanisms we use, consciously or not, to restrict our consciousness of life and the world:
* isolation {{ndash}} an arbitrary dismissal from our consciousness and the consciousness of others about all negative thoughts and feelings associated with the unpleasant facts of our existence. In daily life, this manifests as a tacit agreement to remain silent on certain subjects {{ndash}} especially around children, to prevent instilling in them a fear of the world and what awaits them in life, before they will be able to learn other mechanisms.
* anchoring {{ndash}} the creation and use of personal values to ensure our attachment to reality, such as parents, home, the street, school, God, the church, the State, morality, fate, the law of life, the people, the future, accumulation of material goods or authority, etc. This can be characterized as creating a defensive structure, "a fixation of points within, or construction of walls around, the liquid fray of consciousness", and defending the structure against threats. 
* distraction {{ndash}} shifting focus to new impressions to flee from circumstances and ideas we consider harmful or unpleasant. 
* sublimation {{ndash}} refocusing the tragic parts of life into something creative or valuable, usually through an aesthetic confrontation for the purpose of catharsis. We focus on the imaginary, dramatic, heroic, lyric or comic aspects of life, to allow ourselves and others an escape from their true impact.

According to Zapffe, depressive disorders are often "messages from a deeper, more immediate sense of life, bitter fruits of a geniality of thought".&lt;ref name="autoname1" /&gt; Some studies seem to confirm this, it is said about the phenomenon of [[depressive realism]], and Colin Feltham writes about antinatalism as one of its possible consequences.&lt;ref&gt;C. Feltham, ''Depressive Realism: Interdisciplinary perspectives'', Routledge, Abingdon 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

David Benatar citing numerous studies, lists three phenomena described by psychologists, which, according to him, are responsible for the fact that our self-assessments are unreliable:
# [[Optimism bias|Tendency towards optimism]] (or [[Pollyanna principle]]) – we have a positively distorted picture of our lives in the past, present, and future.
# Adaptation (or accommodation, habituation) – we adapt to negative situations and adjust our expectations accordingly. 
# Comparison – for our self-assessments, more important than how our lives goes is how our lives goes in comparison with lives of others. One of the effects of this is that negative aspects of life that affect everyone are not taken into account when assessing our own well-beings. We are also more likely to compare ourselves with those who are worse off than those who are better off.

Benatar concludes:

{{quote|The above psychological phenomena are unsurprising from an evolutionary perspective. They militate against suicide and in favour of reproduction. If our lives are quite as bad as I shall still suggest they are, and if people were prone to see this true quality of their lives for what it is, they might be much more inclined to kill themselves, or at least not to produce more such lives. Pessimism, then, tends not to be naturally selected.&lt;ref&gt;D. Benatar, ''Better...'', op. cit., pp. 64–69.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Thomas Ligotti]] (born 1953) draws attention to the similarity between Zapffe's philosophy and [[terror management theory]]. Terror management theory argues that humans are equipped with unique cognitive abilities beyond what is necessary for survival, which includes symbolic thinking, extensive self-consciousness, and perception of themselves as temporal beings aware of the finitude of their existence. The desire to live alongside our awareness of the inevitability of death triggers terror in us. Opposition to this fear is among our primary motivations. To escape it, we build defensive structures around ourselves to ensure our symbolic or literal immortality, to feel like valuable members of a meaningful universe, and to focus on protecting ourselves from immediate external threats.&lt;ref&gt;T. Ligotti, ''The Conspiracy against the Human Race: A Contrivance of Horror'', New York: Hippocampus Press, 2010, pp. 112–113.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Abortion ==

Antinatalism can lead to a particular position on [[abortion]].

David Benatar argues for abortion from a "pro-death" perspective. According to Benatar, one comes into existence in the morally relevant sense, when consciousness arises, when a fetus becomes sentient, and up until that time, an abortion is moral, whereas continued pregnancy would be immoral. Benatar refers to [[electroencephalography|EEG]] brain studies and studies on [[prenatal perception|the pain perception of the fetus]], which states that fetal consciousness arises no earlier than between twenty-eight and thirty weeks of pregnancy, before which it is incapable of feeling pain.&lt;ref&gt;D. Benatar, ''Better...'', op. cit., pp. 132–162.&lt;/ref&gt; Contrary to that, the latest report from the [[Royal Academy of Obstetrics and Gynecology]] in the United Kingdom showed that the fetus gains consciousness no earlier than week twenty-four of the pregnancy.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.rcog.org.uk/globalassets/documents/guidelines/rcogfetalawarenesswpr0610.pdf] Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, ''Fetal Awareness – Review of Research and Recommendations for Practice'', London: RCOG Press, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Some assumptions of this report regarding sentience of the fetus after the second trimester were criticized.&lt;ref&gt;[http://fn.bmj.com/content/96/4/F236.long] M. W. Platt, ''Fetal awareness and fetal pain: the Emperor's new clothes'', Archives of Disease in Childhood, 2011, volume 96, issue 4.&lt;/ref&gt; In a similar way argues Karim Akerma. He distinguishes between organisms that do not have mental properties and living beings that have mental properties. According to his view, which he calls the mentalistic view, a living being begins to exist when an organism (or another entity) produces a simple form of consciousness for the first time.&lt;ref&gt;K. Akerma, ''Lebensende und Lebensbeginn: Philosophische Implikationen und mentalistische Begründung des Hirn-Todeskriterium'', Lit, Hamburg 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;K. Akerma, ''Antinatalismus – Ein Handbuch'', epubli, Berlin 2017, p. 404.&lt;/ref&gt;

Julio Cabrera believes that the moral problem of abortion is significantly different from the moral problem of procreation, because in the case of abortion, there is already an existing being in some point of its development process, and no longer a non-being. He emphasizes that it is difficult to determine whether we kill someone when we have an abortion, but he believes that in its strictly manipulative aspect, abortion is closer to procreation than to abstention, and in his view the abortion of a healthy fetus is killing a human being, and is therefore morally unjustifiable. According to Cabrera it is a violation of autonomy and is immoral for the same reason as procreation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://repositorio.unb.br/bitstream/10482/15274/1/LIVRO_PorqueTeAmo.pdf] J. Cabrera, T. Lenharo di Santis, op. cit, pp. 68–69, 77.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7822">'''Assemblage''' (from {{lang-fr|agencement}}, "a collection of things which have been gathered together or assembled") is an ontological framework developed by [[Gilles Deleuze]] and [[Félix Guattari]], originally presented in their book ''[[A Thousand Plateaus]]'' (1980). Assemblage theory provides a bottom-up framework for analyzing social complexity by emphasizing fluidity, exchangeability, and multiple functionalities through entities and their connectivity.&lt;ref&gt;Simandan, D., 2018. Competition, contingency, and destabilization in urban assemblages and actor-networks. Urban Geography, vol. 39 (5), pp. 655-666; https://doi.org/10.1080/02723638.2017.1382307&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=UT2016&gt;Wikis.la.utexas.edu,. (2016). Assemblage Theory | University of Texas Theory. Retrieved 1 March 2016, from {{cite web|url=http://wikis.la.utexas.edu/theory/page/assemblage-theory |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-03-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160314011817/http://wikis.la.utexas.edu/theory/page/assemblage-theory |archivedate=2016-03-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Assemblage theory asserts that, within a body, the relationships of component parts are not stable and fixed; rather, they can be displaced and replaced within and among other bodies, thus approaching systems through relations of exteriority.&lt;ref name=UT2016 /&gt;

==Overview==
The term assemblage, in a philosophical sense, originally stems from the French word ''agencement'', whose meaning translates narrowly to English as "arrangement", "fitting, or "fixing".&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Phillips|first=J.|title=Agencement/Assemblage|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/026327640602300219|journal=Theory, Culture &amp; Society|volume=23|issue=2-3|pages=108–109|doi=10.1177/026327640602300219}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Agencement'' asserts the inherent implication of the connection between specific concepts and that the arrangement of those concepts is what provides sense or meaning.&lt;ref&gt;Buchanan, I., 2015. Assemblage theory and its discontents. Deleuze Studies, 9(3), pp.382-392.&lt;/ref&gt; Assemblage, on the other hand, can be more accurately described as the integration and connection of these concepts and that it is both the connections ''and'' the arrangements of those connections that provide context for assigned meanings.&lt;ref&gt;Buchanan, I., 2015. Assemblage theory and its discontents. Deleuze Studies, 9(3), pp.382-392.&lt;/ref&gt; 

John Phillips argued in 2006 that Deleuze and Guattari rarely used the term assemblage at all in a philosophical sense, and that through narrow, literal English translations, the terms became misleadingly perceived as analogous. The translation of ''agencement'' as assemblage that "give[s] rise to the connotations based on analogical impressions, which liberate elements of a vocabulary from the arguments that once helped form it." &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Deleuze and Guattari&lt;!--linked from 'Gilles Deleuze' and 'Template:Deleuze-Guattari'--&gt; ==
In ''[[A Thousand Plateaus: Capitalism and Schizophrenia]]'', Deleuze and Guattari draw from [[dynamical systems theory]], which explores the way material systems self-organize, and extend the theory to include social, linguistic, and philosophical systems in order to create assemblage theory.&lt;ref name="Stanford2008"&gt;Smith, D., &amp; Protevi, J. (2008). Gilles Deleuze. plato.stanford.edu. Retrieved 1 March 2016, from http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/deleuze/#ThoPla&lt;/ref&gt; In assemblage theory, assemblages (or relationships) are formed through the processes of coding, stratification, and territorialization&lt;ref&gt;Simandan, D., 2018. Competition, contingency, and destabilization in urban assemblages and actor-networks. Urban Geography, vol. 39 (5), pp. 655-666; https://doi.org/10.1080/02723638.2017.1382307  &lt;/ref&gt;. Any one philosophical context never operates in isolation. &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Deleuze and Guattari use the term "constellation" when they talk about assemblage.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} A constellation, like any assemblage, is made up of imaginative contingent articulations among myriad heterogeneous elements.&lt;ref name="SlackandWise"&gt;Wise, J., &amp; Slack, J. (2014). Culture and Technology. New York, NY: Lang, Peter New York.&lt;/ref&gt; This process of ordering matter around a body is called coding.&lt;ref name="Stanford2008" /&gt; According to Deleuze and Guattari, assemblages are coded by taking a particular form; they select, compose, and complete a territory.&lt;ref name="SlackandWise" /&gt; In composing a territory, there exists the creation of hierarchical bodies in the process of stratification.&lt;ref name="Stanford2008" /&gt; Drawing from the constellation metaphor, Deleuze and Guattari argue that the constellation includes some heavenly bodies but leaves out others; the included bodies being those in close proximity given the particular gathering and angle of view.&lt;ref name="SlackandWise" /&gt; The example constellation thus defines the relationships with the bodies in and around it, and therefore demonstrates the social complexity of assemblage.

Territorialization is another process of assemblage theory, and is viewed as the ordering of the bodies that create the "assemblage".&lt;ref name="Stanford2008" /&gt; Assemblages territorialize both forms of content and forms of expression. Forms of content, also known as material forms, include the assemblage of human and nonhuman bodies, actions, and reactions. Forms of expression include incorporeal enunciations, acts, and statements.&lt;ref name="SlackandWise" /&gt; Within this ordering of the bodies, assemblages do not remain static; they are further characterized by processes of [[deterritorialization]] and reterritorialization. Deterritorialization occurs when articulations are disarticulated and disconnected through components "exiting" the assemblage; once again exemplfying the idea that these forms do not and can not operate alone&lt;ref name="SlackandWise" /&gt; Reterritorialization describes the process by which new components "enter" and new articulations are forged, thus constituting a new assemblage.&lt;ref name="SlackandWise" /&gt; In this way, these axes of content/expressive and the processes of territorialization exist to demonstrate the complex nature of  assemblages.

== DeLanda ==
[[Manuel DeLanda]] detailed the concept of assemblage in his book ''[[A New Philosophy of Society]]'' (2006) where, like Deleuze and Guattari, he suggests that social bodies on all scales are best analyzed through their individual components. Like Deleuze and Guattari, DeLanda’s approach examines relations of exteriority, in which assemblage components are self-subsistent and retain autonomy outside of the assemblage in which they exist &lt;ref name="Karaman2008"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Karaman | first1 = O | year = 2008 | title = A New Philosophy of Society: Assemblage Theory And Social Complexity by Manuel DeLanda | doi = 10.1111/j.1467-8330.2008.00646.x | journal = Antipode | volume = 40 | issue = 5| pages = 935–937 }}&lt;/ref&gt; DeLanda details Deleuze and Guattari's (1987) assemblage theory of how assemblage components are organized through the two axes of material/expressive and territorializing/deterritorializing.&lt;ref name="Karaman2008" /&gt; DeLanda's additional contribution is to suggest that a third axis exists: of genetic/linguistic resources that also defines the interventions involved in the coding, decoding, and recoding of the assemblage.&lt;ref name="Karaman2008" /&gt; Like Deleuze and Guattari, DeLanda suggests that the social does not lose its reality, nor its materiality, through its complexity.&lt;ref name="UT2016" /&gt; In this way, assemblages are effective in their practicality; assemblages, though fluid, are nevertheless part of historically significant processes.

'''''Breath of the Gods – A Journey to the Origins of Modern Yoga ''''' ({{lang-de|Der atmende Gott – Reise zum Ursprung des modernen Yoga}}) is a 2012 German [[documentary]] about  the origins of modern [[Hatha yoga]].

==Summary==
Jan Schmidt-Garre depicts the life and work of [[T. Krishnamacharya]] by interviewing people who knew him. He is told how and why this pioneer started to run a public Hatha Yoga school and shares the information with the audience. Contemporary shots are intercut with historical footage. Thus he explores questions which are crucial for Western adepts, such as whether Hatha Yoga really is of ancient origin and whether it free from religion or interwoven with [[Hinduism|hinduistic]] beliefs. Finally he reveals that  Krishnamacharya regularly attended a certain temple where was inspired by ancient pictures of an ancient demonstrating [[asana]]s.

'''Clive Staples Lewis''' (29 November 1898&amp;nbsp;– 22 November 1963) was a British writer and [[lay theologian]]. He held academic positions in English literature at both [[Oxford University]] ([[Magdalen College, Oxford|Magdalen College]], 1925–1954) and [[Cambridge University]] ([[Magdalene College, Cambridge|Magdalene College]], 1954–1963). He is best known for his works of fiction, especially ''[[The Screwtape Letters]]'', ''[[The Chronicles of Narnia]]'', and ''[[The Space Trilogy]]'', and for his non-fiction Christian apologetics, such as ''[[Mere Christianity]]'', ''[[Miracles (book)|Miracles]]'', and ''[[The Problem of Pain]]''.

Lewis and fellow novelist [[J. R. R. Tolkien]] were close friends. They both served on the English faculty at Oxford University, and were active in the informal Oxford literary group known as the [[Inklings]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Inklings: C. S. Lewis, J. R. R. Tolkien and Their Friends|last=Carpenter|first=Humphrey|publisher=HarperCollins Publishers Ltd.|year=2017|isbn=9780007748693|location=London|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Lewis's memoir ''[[Surprised by Joy]]'', he was baptised in the [[Church of Ireland]], but fell away from his faith during adolescence. Lewis returned to  [[Anglicanism]] at the age of 32, owing to the influence of Tolkien and other friends, and he became an "ordinary layman of the Church of England".{{sfn|Lewis|1997|p=6}} Lewis's faith profoundly affected his work, and his wartime radio broadcasts on the subject of Christianity brought him wide acclaim.

Lewis wrote more than 30 books&lt;ref&gt;Richard B. Cunningham, ''C. S. Lewis: Defender of the Faith'', Wipf and Stock Publishers (2008), p. 14&lt;/ref&gt; which have been translated into more than 30 languages and have sold millions of copies. The books that make up ''The Chronicles of Narnia'' have sold the most and have been popularised on stage, TV, radio, and cinema. His philosophical writings are widely cited by Christian apologists from many denominations.

In 1956, Lewis married American writer [[Joy Davidman]]; she died of cancer four years later at the age of 45. Lewis died on 22 November 1963 from [[renal failure]], one week before his 65th birthday. In 2013, on the 50th anniversary of his death, Lewis was honoured with a memorial in [[Poets' Corner]] in [[Westminster Abbey]].

==Biography==

===Childhood===
[[File:Little Lea.JPG|thumb|Little Lea, home of the Lewis family from 1905 to 1930]]
Clive Staples Lewis was born in [[Belfast]], Ireland&lt;!-- not "Northern Ireland, because Northern Ireland did not exist at the time --&gt;, on 29 November 1898.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite ODNB|id=34512|title=Lewis, Clive Staples (1898–1963)|origyear=2004|year=2008|last=Bennett|first=Jack Arthur Walter|last2=Plaskitt|first2=Emma Lisa}}&lt;/ref&gt; His father was Albert James Lewis (1863–1929), a solicitor whose father Richard had come to Ireland from Wales during the mid-19th century. His mother was Florence Augusta Lewis, [[Given name#Name at birth|née]] Hamilton (1862–1908), known as Flora, the daughter of a [[Church of Ireland]] priest, and great granddaughter of both Bishop [[Hugh Hamilton (bishop)|Hugh Hamilton]] and [[John Staples]]. He had an elder brother, [[Warren Lewis|Warren Hamilton Lewis]] (known as "Warnie").&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.cslewis.org/resource/chronocsl/|title=The Life of C.S.

Lewis Biography|website=Encyclopedia of World Biography|access-date=11 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When Lewis was four, his dog Jacksie was killed by a car, and he announced that his name was now Jacksie. At first, he would answer to no other name, but later accepted Jack, the name by which he was known to friends and family for the rest of his life.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Ten Boys Who Used Their Talents|last=Howat|first=Irene|publisher=Christian Focus Publications Ltd|year=2006|isbn=978-1-84550-146-4|location=Great Britain|pages=22}}&lt;/ref&gt; When he was seven, his family moved into "Little Lea", the family home of his childhood, in the [[Strandtown]] area of East Belfast.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cslewisinstitute.org/Surprised_by_Belfast_Significant_Sites_in_the_Land_and_Life_of_CS_Lewis_Part_I_Little_Lea_FullArticle|title=Surprised by Belfast: Significant Sites in the Land and Life of C.S. Lewis, Part 1, Little Lea|last=Smith|first=Sandy|date=18 February 2016|website=C.S. Lewis Institute|access-date=7 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a boy, Lewis was fascinated with [[anthropomorphic]] animals; he fell in love with [[Beatrix Potter]]'s stories and often wrote and illustrated his own animal stories. He and his brother Warnie created the world of [[Boxen (C. S. Lewis)|Boxen]], inhabited and run by animals. Lewis loved to read; his father's house was filled with books, and he felt that finding a book to read was as easy as walking into a field and "finding a new blade of grass".{{sfn|Lewis|1966b|p=10}}
{{Quote box|align=right|quote=&lt;poem&gt;
The New House is almost a major character in my story.
I am the product of long corridors, empty sunlit rooms,
upstair indoor silences, attics explored in solitude,
distant noises of gurgling cisterns and pipes,
and the noise of wind under the tiles. Also, of endless books.&lt;/poem&gt;
|source=—''[[Surprised by Joy]]''}}
Lewis was schooled by private tutors until age 9, when his mother died in 1908 from cancer. His father then sent him to live and study at [[Wynyard School]] in [[Watford]], Hertfordshire. Lewis's brother had enrolled there three years previously. The school was closed not long afterwards due to a lack of pupils; the headmaster Robert "Oldie" Capron was soon after committed to a psychiatric hospital. Lewis then attended [[Campbell College]] in the east of Belfast about a mile from his home, but left after a few months due to respiratory problems. He was then sent to the health-resort town of [[Malvern, Worcestershire|Malvern]], Worcestershire, where he attended the preparatory school Cherbourg House, which Lewis calls "Chartres" in his autobiography. It was during this time that Lewis abandoned his childhood Christian faith and became an atheist, becoming interested in mythology and the occult.{{sfn|Lewis|1966b|p=56}} In September 1913, Lewis enrolled at [[Malvern College]], where he remained until the following June. He found the school socially competitive.{{sfn|Lewis|1966a|p=107}} After leaving Malvern, he studied privately with [[William T. Kirkpatrick]], his father's old tutor and former headmaster of [[Lurgan College]].&lt;ref name="Lewis"&gt;{{cite book |last=Lewis |first=C.S. |date=1955 |title=Surprised by Joy: The Shape of My Early Life |location=New York City |publisher=[[Harcourt Brace Jovanovich]] |pages=128–186 |isbn=0-15-687011-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a teenager, Lewis was wonder-struck by the songs and legends of what he called ''Northernness'', the ancient literature of Scandinavia preserved in the [[Icelandic sagas]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=C. S. Lewis|last=Bloom|first=Harold|publisher=Chelsea House Publishers|year=2006|isbn=0791093190|location=New York|pages=196}}&lt;/ref&gt; These legends intensified an inner longing that he would later call "joy". He also grew to love nature; its beauty reminded him of the stories of the North, and the stories of the North reminded him of the beauties of nature. His teenage writings moved away from the tales of Boxen, and he began using different art forms, such as [[epic poetry]] and opera, to try to capture his new-found interest in [[Norse mythology]] and the natural world. Studying with Kirkpatrick ("The Great Knock", as Lewis afterwards called him) instilled in him a love of [[Greek literature]] and mythology and sharpened his debate and reasoning skills. In 1916, Lewis was awarded a scholarship at [[University College, Oxford]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cslewis.com/us/about-cs-lewis|title= About C.S. Lewis |publisher=CSLewis.com | access-date =4 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within months of entering Oxford, the British Army shipped him to France to fight in the [[First World War]].&lt;ref name="Lewis" /&gt; In one of his letters, Lewis cited that his experience of the horror of war, along with the loss of his mother and his unhappiness in school, were the bases of his pessimism and atheism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=C.S. Lewis and Human Suffering: Light Among the Shadows|last=Conn|first=Marie|publisher=HiddenSpring|year=2008|isbn=9781587680441|location=Mahwah, NJ|pages=21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==="My Irish life"&lt;!--Note to editors: Lewis described this as "My Irish Life" see the bottom of this section for the title's meaning--&gt;===
[[File:CSLewisPlaque.jpg|thumb|Plaque on a park-bench in [[Bangor, County Down]]]]
Lewis experienced a certain cultural shock on first arriving in England: "No Englishman will be able to understand my first impressions of England," Lewis wrote in ''[[Surprised by Joy]]''. "The strange [[Regional accents of English speakers|English accents]] with which I was surrounded seemed like the voices of demons. But what was worst was the English landscape&amp;nbsp;... I have made up the quarrel since; but at that moment I conceived a hatred for England which took many years to heal."{{sfn|Lewis|1966b|p=24}}

From boyhood, Lewis had immersed himself in [[Norse mythology|Norse]] and [[Greek mythology|Greek]] mythology, and later in [[Irish mythology]] and [[Irish literature|literature]]. He also expressed an interest in the Irish language,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Wayne |last=Martindale |title=Beyond the Shadowlands: C. S. Lewis on Heaven and Hell |publisher=Crossway |year=2005 |page=52 |isbn=978-1581345131}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Lewis|1984|p=118}} though there is not much evidence that he laboured to learn it. He developed a particular fondness for [[W. B. Yeats]], in part because of Yeats's use of Ireland's Celtic heritage in poetry. In a letter to a friend, Lewis wrote, "I have here discovered an author exactly after my own heart, whom I am sure you would delight in, W. B. Yeats. He writes plays and poems of rare spirit and beauty about our old Irish mythology."{{sfn|Lewis|2000|p=59}}

In 1921, Lewis met Yeats twice, since Yeats had moved to Oxford.{{sfn|Lewis|2004|pp= 564–65}} Lewis was surprised to find his English peers indifferent to Yeats and the [[Celtic Revival]] movement, and wrote: "I am often surprised to find how utterly ignored Yeats is among the men I have met: perhaps his appeal is purely Irish&amp;nbsp;– if so, then thank the gods that I am Irish."&lt;ref name="On Yeats"&gt;Yeats's appeal wasn't exclusively Irish; he was also a major "magical opponent" of famed English occultist [[Aleister Crowley]], as noted extensively throughout Lawrence Sutin's [https://books.google.com/books?id=JpR0FKRIissC&amp;pg=PA69&amp;lpg=PA32&amp;dq=aleister+crowley+yeats&amp;resnum=3&amp;ct=result ''Do what thou wilt: a life of Aleister Crowley'']. New York: MacMillan (St. Martins). cf. pp. 56–78.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=King |first=Francis |year=1978 |title=The Magical World of Aleister Crowley |location=New York |publisher=Coward, McCann &amp; Geoghegan |isbn=0-698-10884-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Early in his career, Lewis considered sending his work to the major [[Dublin]] publishers, writing: "If I do ever send my stuff to a publisher, I think I shall try Maunsel, those Dublin people, and so tack myself definitely onto the Irish school."{{sfn|Lewis|2000|p=59}} After his [[conversion to Christianity]], his interests gravitated towards Christian theology and away from pagan Celtic mysticism.&lt;ref name="Thomas"&gt;{{cite book |first=Thomas C. |last=Peters |title=Simply C. S. Lewis: A Beginner's Guide to the Life and Works of C. S. Lewis |publisher=Crossway Books |year=1997 |page=70 |isbn=978-0891079484}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lewis occasionally expressed a somewhat tongue-in-cheek chauvinism toward the English. Describing an encounter with a fellow Irishman, he wrote: "Like all Irish people who meet in England, we ended by criticisms on the invincible flippancy and dullness of the Anglo-Saxon race. After all, there is no doubt, ''ami'', that the Irish are the only people: with all their faults, I would not gladly live or die among another folk."{{sfn|Lewis|2004|p= 310}} Throughout his life, he sought out the company of other Irish people living in England{{sfn|Clare|2010|pp=21–22}} and visited Northern Ireland regularly. In 1958 he spent his honeymoon there at the Old Inn, [[Crawfordsburn]],{{sfn|The Old Inn|2007|p=}} which he called "my Irish life".{{sfn|Lewis|1993|p=93}}

Various critics have suggested that it was Lewis's dismay over sectarian conflict in his native Belfast which led him to eventually adopt such an [[Ecumenism|ecumenical]] brand of Christianity.{{sfn|Wilson|1991|p=xi}} As one critic has said, Lewis "repeatedly extolled the virtues of all branches of the Christian faith, emphasising a need for unity among Christians around what the Catholic writer {{nowrap|G. K. Chesterton}} called 'Mere Christianity', the core doctrinal beliefs that all denominations share".{{sfn|Clare|2010|p=24}} On the other hand, Paul Stevens of the [[University of Toronto]] has written that "Lewis's mere Christianity&lt;!-- not a book title --&gt; masked many of the political prejudices of an old-fashioned Ulster Protestant, a native of middle-class Belfast for whom British withdrawal from Northern Ireland even in the 1950s and 1960s was unthinkable."&lt;ref&gt;Paul Stevens, review of "Reforming Empire: Protestant Colonialism and Conscience in British Literature" by Christopher Hodgkins, ''[[Modern Philology]]'', Vol. 103, Issue 1 (August 2005), pp. 137–8, citing Humphrey Carpenter, ''The Inklings'' (London: Allen &amp; Unwin, 1978), pp. 50–52, 206–7.&lt;/ref&gt;

===First World War and Oxford University===
Soon after Lewis entered Oxford in the 1917 summer term, he joined the [[Officers' Training Corps]] at the university as his "most promising route into the army".&lt;ref name=Joy&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lewis|first1=C.

He was [[demobilised]] in December 1918 and soon restarted his studies.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}

After Lewis returned to Oxford University, he received a [[British undergraduate degree classification|First]] in [[Honour Moderations]] (Greek and [[Latin literature]]) in 1920, a First in [[Literae Humaniores|Greats]] (Philosophy and Ancient History) in 1922, and a First in English in 1923. In 1924 he became a philosophy tutor at [[University College Oxford|University College]] and, in 1925, was elected a Fellow and Tutor in English Literature at [[Magdalen College, Oxford|Magdalen College]], where he served for 29 years until 1954.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}

===Jane Moore===
During his army training, Lewis shared a room with another cadet, Edward Courtnay Francis "Paddy" Moore (1898–1918). Maureen Moore, Paddy's sister, said that the two made a mutual pact{{sfn|Edwards|2007|p=133}} that if either died during the war, the survivor would take care of both of their families. Paddy was killed in action in 1918 and Lewis kept his promise. Paddy had earlier introduced Lewis to his mother, Jane King Moore, and a friendship quickly sprang up between Lewis, who was eighteen when they met, and Jane, who was forty-five. The friendship with Moore was particularly important to Lewis while he was recovering from his wounds in hospital, as his father did not visit him.

Lewis lived with and cared for Moore until she was hospitalised in the late 1940s. He routinely introduced her as his mother, referred to her as such in letters, and developed a deeply affectionate friendship with her. Lewis's own mother had died when he was a child, and his father was distant, demanding, and eccentric.

Speculation regarding their relationship resurfaced with the 1990 publication of [[A. N. Wilson]]'s biography of Lewis. Wilson (who never met Lewis) attempted to make a case for their having been lovers for a time. Wilson's biography was not the first to address the question of Lewis's relationship with Moore. [[George Sayer]] knew Lewis for 29 years, and he had sought to shed light on the relationship during the period of 14 years prior to Lewis's conversion to Christianity. In his biography ''Jack: A Life of C. S. Lewis'', he wrote:
{{quote |Were they lovers? Owen Barfield, who knew Jack well in the 1920s, once said that he thought the likelihood was "fifty-fifty". Although she was twenty-six years older than Jack, she was still a handsome woman, and he was certainly infatuated with her. But it seems very odd, if they were lovers, that he would call her "mother". We know, too, that they did not share the same bedroom. It seems most likely that he was bound to her by the promise he had given to Paddy and that his promise was reinforced by his love for her as his second mother.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Sayer |first=George |year=1997 |title=Jack: A Life of C. S. Lewis |location=London |publisher=Hodder &amp; Stoughton |page=154 |isbn=978-0340690680}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Later Sayer changed his mind. In the introduction to the 1997 edition of his biography of Lewis he wrote:
{{quote |I have had to alter my opinion of Lewis's relationship with Mrs. Moore. In chapter eight of this book I wrote that I was uncertain about whether they were lovers.  Now after conversations with Mrs. Moore's daughter, Maureen, and a consideration of the way in which their bedrooms were arranged at The Kilns, I am quite certain that they were.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.impalapublications.com/blog/index.php?/archives/5185-C.S.-Lewis-and-Mrs-Janie-Moore,-by-James-OFee.html|title=C.S. Lewis and Mrs Janie Moore, by James O'Fee|publisher=impalapublications.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Lewis spoke well of Mrs. Moore throughout his life, saying to his friend George Sayer, "She was generous and taught me to be generous, too." In December 1917, Lewis wrote in a letter to his childhood friend Arthur Greeves that Jane and Greeves were "the two people who matter most to me in the world".

In 1930, Lewis moved into "The Kilns" with his brother Warnie, Mrs. Moore, and her daughter Maureen. The Kilns was a house in the district of [[Headington Quarry]] on the outskirts of Oxford, now part of the suburb of [[Risinghurst]]. They all contributed financially to the purchase of the house, which passed to Maureen, who by then was [[Maureen Dunbar|Dame Maureen Dunbar]], when Warren died in 1973.

Jane Moore suffered from [[dementia]] in her later years and was eventually moved into a nursing home, where she died in 1951. Lewis visited her every day in this home until her death.

===Return to Christianity===
Lewis was raised in a religious family that attended the [[Church of Ireland]]. He became an atheist at age 15, though he later described his young self as being paradoxically "angry with God for not existing".{{sfn|Lewis|1966b|p=115}} His early separation from Christianity began when he started to view his religion as a chore and a duty; around this time, he also gained an interest in the occult, as his studies expanded to include such topics.&lt;ref&gt;''The Critic'', Volume 32, Thomas More Association, 1973. Original from the [[University of Michigan]].&lt;/ref&gt; Lewis quoted [[Lucretius]] (''De rerum natura'', 5.198–9) as having one of the [[Argument from poor design|strongest arguments]] for atheism:{{sfn|Lewis|1966b|p=65}}

:{{lang|lt|Nequaquam nobis divinitus esse paratam}}
:{{lang|lt|Naturam rerum; tanta stat praedita culpa}}

which he translated poetically as follows:

:Had God designed the world, it would not be
:A world so frail and faulty as we see.

(This is a highly poetic, rather than a literal translation.  A more literal translation, by William Ellery Leonard,{{sfn|Lucretius|1916}} reads: "That in no wise the nature of all things / For us was fashioned by a power divine – / So great the faults it stands encumbered with.")

Lewis's interest in the works of [[George MacDonald]] was part of what turned him from atheism. This can be seen particularly well through this passage in Lewis's ''[[The Great Divorce]]'', chapter nine, when the semi-autobiographical [[Protagonist|main character]] meets MacDonald in [[Heaven]]:
{{quote |...&amp;nbsp;I tried, trembling, to tell this man all that his writings had done for me. I tried to tell how a certain frosty afternoon at Leatherhead Station when I had first bought a copy of ''[[Phantastes]]'' (being then about sixteen years old) had been to me what the first sight of Beatrice had been to Dante: ''Here begins the new life''. I started to confess how long that Life had delayed in the region of imagination merely: how slowly and reluctantly I had come to admit that his Christendom had more than an accidental connexion with it, how hard I had tried not to see the true name of the quality which first met me in his books is Holiness.{{sfn|Lewis|2002b|pp=66–67}}}}

He eventually returned to Christianity, having been influenced by arguments with his Oxford colleague and Christian friend [[J. R. R. Tolkien]], whom he seems to have met for the first time on 11 May 1926, and the book ''[[The Everlasting Man]]'' by [[G. K. Chesterton]]. Lewis vigorously resisted conversion, noting that he was brought into Christianity like a prodigal, "kicking, struggling, resentful, and darting his eyes in every direction for a chance to escape".{{sfn|Lewis|1966b|p=229}} He described his last struggle in ''[[Surprised by Joy]]'':

{{quote |You must picture me alone in that room in Magdalen [College, Oxford], night after night, feeling, whenever my mind lifted even for a second from my work, the steady, unrelenting approach of Him whom I so earnestly desired not to meet. That which I greatly feared had at last come upon me. In the Trinity Term of 1929 I gave in, and admitted that God was God, and knelt and prayed: perhaps, that night, the most dejected and reluctant convert in all England.{{sfn|Lewis|1966b|pp=228, 229}}}}

After his conversion to [[theism]] in 1929, Lewis converted to Christianity in 1931, following a long discussion and late-night walk with his close friends Tolkien and [[Hugo Dyson]]. He records making a specific commitment to Christian belief while on his way to the zoo with his brother. He became a member of the [[Church of England]]&amp;nbsp;– somewhat to the disappointment of Tolkien, who had hoped that he would join the Catholic Church.{{sfn|Carpenter|2006}}{{Rp|needed=yes|date=March 2012}}{{incomplete short citation|date=October 2016}}

Lewis was a committed [[Church of England|Anglican]] who upheld a largely orthodox Anglican theology, though in his [[apologetics|apologetic]] writings, he made an effort to avoid espousing any one denomination. In his later writings, some believe that he proposed ideas such as purification of [[venial sin]]s after death in [[purgatory]] (''[[The Great Divorce]]'' and ''[[Letters to Malcolm]]'') and [[mortal sin]] (''[[The Screwtape Letters]]''), which are generally considered to be Roman Catholic teachings, although they are also widely held in Anglicanism (particularly in [[high church]] [[Anglo-Catholicism|Anglo-Catholic]] circles). Regardless, Lewis considered himself an entirely orthodox Anglican to the end of his life, reflecting that he had initially attended church only to receive communion and had been repelled by the hymns and the poor quality of the sermons. He later came to consider himself honoured by worshipping with men of faith who came in shabby clothes and work boots and who sang all the verses to all the hymns.{{sfn|Wilson|2002|p=147}}

===Second World War===
After the outbreak of the [[Second World War]] in 1939, the Lewises took child evacuees from London and other cities into [[The Kilns]].&lt;ref name=tst&gt;{{cite book |last=Bingham |first=Derick |title=C. S. Lewis: The Story Teller |series=Trailblazers |year=1999 |publisher=[[Christian Focus Publications]] |pages=85–87 |isbn=978-1-85792-487-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lewis was only 40 when the war started, and he tried to re-enter military service, offering to instruct cadets; but his offer was not accepted. He rejected the recruiting office's suggestion of writing columns for the [[Ministry of Information (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Information]] in the press, as he did not want to "write lies"&lt;ref name=tst2&gt;{{cite book |first=Derick |last=Bingham |title=C. S. Lewis: The Story Teller |publisher=CF4Kids |series=Trailblazers |year=2004 |page=88 |isbn=978-1857924879}}&lt;/ref&gt; to deceive the enemy. He later served in the local [[Home Guard (United Kingdom)|Home Guard]] in Oxford.&lt;ref name=tst2 /&gt;

From 1941 to 1943, Lewis spoke on religious programmes broadcast by the BBC from London while the city was under periodic air raids.&lt;ref name=tst3&gt;{{cite book |first=Derick |last=Bingham |title=C. S. Lewis: The Story Teller |year=2004 |pages=91–93 |isbn=978-1857924879}}&lt;/ref&gt; These broadcasts were appreciated by civilians and servicemen at that stage. For example, [[Donald Hardman|Air Chief Marshal Sir Donald Hardman]] wrote:

:"The war, the whole of life, everything tended to seem pointless. We needed, many of us, a key to the meaning of the universe. Lewis provided just that."&lt;ref name=tst4&gt;{{cite book |first=Derick |last=Bingham |title=C. S. Lewis: The Story Teller |year=2004 |page=93 |isbn=978-1857924879}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The broadcasts were anthologised in ''Mere Christianity''. From 1941, he was occupied at his summer holiday weekends visiting R.A.F. stations to speak on his faith, invited by the [[Royal Air Force|R.A.F.'s]] [[Chaplain-in-Chief]] [[Maurice Edwards]].&lt;ref name=tst5&gt;{{cite book |first=Derick |last=Bingham |title=C. S. Lewis: The Story Teller |year=2004 |page=94 |isbn=978-1857924879}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was also during the same wartime period that Lewis was invited to become first President of the [[Socratic Club|Oxford Socratic Club]] in January 1942,&lt;ref name=tst6&gt;{{cite book |first=Derick |last=Bingham |title=C. S. Lewis: The Story Teller |year=2004 |page=96 |isbn=978-1857924879}}&lt;/ref&gt; a position that he enthusiastically held until he resigned on appointment to Cambridge University in 1954.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}

===Honour declined===

Lewis was named on the last list of honours by [[George VI]] in December 1951 as a [[Commander of the Order of the British Empire]] (CBE) but declined so as to avoid association with any political issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cslewis.org/resources/chronocsl.html |title=Chronology of the Life of C.S.

Lewis |editor2=Walter Hooper}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chair at Cambridge University===
In 1954, Lewis accepted the newly founded chair of Mediaeval and Renaissance Literature at [[Magdalene College, Cambridge]], where he finished his career. He maintained a strong attachment to the city of [[Oxford]], keeping a home there and returning on weekends until his death in 1963.

In later life, Lewis corresponded with [[Joy Gresham|Joy Davidman Gresham]], an American writer of Jewish background, a former Communist, and a convert from atheism to Christianity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=David R. |last=Reagan |url=http://christinprophecy.org/articles/c-s-lewis-his-conversion/ |title=C.

Gresham]], and came to England with her two sons, David and [[Douglas Gresham|Douglas]].{{sfn|Haven|2006}} Lewis at first regarded her as an agreeable intellectual companion and personal friend, and it was on this level that he agreed to enter into a [[civil marriage]] contract with her so that she could continue to live in the UK.{{sfn|Hooper|Green|2002|p=268}} The civil marriage took place at the [[register office]], 42 [[St Giles', Oxford]], on 23 April 1956.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LWK59Z68ZGoC&amp;pg=PA79|last=Hooper|first=Walter|title=C.

Joy was the only woman whom he had met&amp;nbsp;... who had a brain which matched his own in suppleness, in width of interest, and in analytical grasp, and above all in humour and a sense of fun."{{sfn|Haven|2006}} After complaining of a painful hip, she was diagnosed with terminal [[bone cancer]], and the relationship developed to the point that they sought a Christian marriage. Since she was divorced, this was not straightforward in the Church of England at the time, but a friend, the Rev. Peter Bide, performed the ceremony at her bed in the [[Churchill Hospital]] on 21 March 1957.&lt;ref&gt;Schultz and West (eds), ''The C. S. Lewis Reader's Encyclopedia'' (Zondervan, Grand Rapids, Michigan, 1988), p. 249.&lt;/ref&gt;

Gresham's cancer soon went into remission, and the couple lived together as a family with [[Warren Lewis]] until 1960, when recurrence of the cancer caused her death on 13 July. Earlier that year, the couple took a brief holiday in Greece and the [[Aegean Sea|Aegean]]; Lewis was fond of walking but not of travel, and this marked his only crossing of the English Channel after 1918. Lewis's book ''[[A Grief Observed]]'' describes his experience of bereavement in such a raw and personal fashion that he originally released it under the pseudonym N. W. Clerk to keep readers from associating the book with him. Ironically, many friends recommended the book to Lewis as a method for dealing with his own grief. After Lewis's death, his authorship was made public by Faber's, with the permission of the executors.{{sfn|Lewis|1961|loc=jacket notes}}

Lewis continued to raise Gresham's two sons after her death. [[Douglas Gresham]] is a Christian like Lewis and his mother,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | url = http://www.theage.com.au/news/books/at-home-in-narnia/2005/12/03/1133422143366.html?page=fullpage | title = At home in Narnia | newspaper = The Age | location = Melbourne, Australia | date = 3 December 2005 | page = 2}}&lt;/ref&gt; while David Gresham turned to his mother's ancestral faith, becoming Orthodox Jewish in his beliefs. His mother's writings had featured the Jews in an unsympathetic manner, particularly one "[[shohet]]" (ritual slaughterer). David informed Lewis that he was going to become a ritual slaughterer to present this type of Jewish religious functionary to the world in a more favourable light. In a 2005 interview, Douglas Gresham acknowledged that he and his brother were not close, but he did say that they are in email contact.&lt;ref name = "theage.com.au"&gt;{{Cite news | url = http://www.theage.com.au/news/books/at-home-in-narnia/2005/12/03/1133422143366.html?page=4 | title = At home in Narnia | newspaper = The Age | location=Melbourne, Australia | date = 3 December 2005 | page = 4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Douglas remains involved in the affairs of the Lewis estate.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}

===Illness and death===
[[File:C. S. Lewis' grave.jpg|thumb|C. S. Lewis's grave at [[Holy Trinity Church, Headington Quarry]]]]
In early June 1961, Lewis began suffering from [[nephritis]], which resulted in blood poisoning. His illness caused him to miss the autumn term at Cambridge, though his health gradually began improving in 1962 and he returned that April. His health continued to improve and, according to his friend George Sayer, Lewis was fully himself by early 1963. On 15 July that year, he fell ill and was admitted to the hospital; he suffered a heart attack at 5:00&amp;nbsp;pm the next day and lapsed into a coma, unexpectedly waking the following day at 2:00&amp;nbsp;pm. After he was discharged from the hospital, Lewis returned to the Kilns, though he was too ill to return to work. As a result, he resigned from his post at Cambridge in August.

Lewis's condition continued to decline, and he was diagnosed with end-stage [[Chronic renal failure|renal failure]] in mid-November. He collapsed in his bedroom at 5:30&amp;nbsp;pm on 22 November, exactly one week before his 65th birthday, and died a few minutes later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=McGrath |first=Alister |year=2013 |title=C.

Lewis – A Life: Eccentric Genius, Reluctant Prophet |publisher=Tyndale House Publishers, Inc |page=358}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is buried in the churchyard of [[Holy Trinity Church, Headington Quarry|Holy Trinity Church]], [[Headington|Headington, Oxford]].{{sfn|FoHTC}} His brother [[Warren Lewis|Warren]] died on 9 April 1973 and was buried in the same grave.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://cslewis.drzeus.net/multimedia/ | work =Into the Wardrobe | title = Picture Album | publisher = Dr Zeus | access-date =7 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Media coverage of Lewis's death was almost completely overshadowed by news of the [[Assassination of John F. Kennedy|assassination of US President John F. Kennedy]], which occurred on the same day (approximately 55 minutes following Lewis's collapse), as did the death of English writer [[Aldous Huxley]], author of ''[[Brave New World]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Ruddick |first=Nicholas |year=1993 |title=Ultimate Island: On the Nature of British Science Fiction |publisher=Greenwood Press |isbn=978-0313273735 |page=28}}&lt;/ref&gt; This coincidence was the inspiration for [[Peter Kreeft]]'s book ''[[Between Heaven and Hell (novel)|Between Heaven and Hell: A Dialog Somewhere Beyond Death with John F.

[[File:Eagle and Child.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[The Eagle and Child]] pub in Oxford where the Inklings met on Tuesday mornings in 1939]]
Lewis was a prolific writer, and his circle of literary friends became an informal discussion society known as the "[[Inklings]]", including [[J. R. R.

Of Tolkien, Lewis writes in ''[[Surprised by Joy]]'':

{{quote |When I began teaching for the English Faculty, I made two other friends, both Christians (these queer people seemed now to pop up on every side) who were later to give me much help in getting over the last stile. They were HVV Dyson&amp;nbsp;... and JRR Tolkien. Friendship with the latter marked the breakdown of two old prejudices. At my first coming into the world I had been (implicitly) warned never to trust a Papist, and at my first coming into the English Faculty (explicitly) never to trust a [[philology|philologist]]. Tolkien was both.{{sfn|Lewis|1966b|p=216}}}}

===Novelist===
In addition to his scholarly work, Lewis wrote several popular novels, including the science fiction ''[[Space Trilogy]]'' for adults and the [[Narnia]] fantasies for children. Most deal implicitly with Christian themes such as sin, humanity's [[Fall of Man|fall from grace]], and redemption.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}

His first novel after becoming a Christian was ''[[The Pilgrim's Regress]]'' (1933), which depicted his experience with Christianity in the style of [[John Bunyan]]'s ''[[The Pilgrim's Progress]]''. The book was poorly received by critics at the time,&lt;ref name="Thomas" /&gt; although David [[Martyn Lloyd-Jones]], one of Lewis's contemporaries at Oxford, gave him much-valued encouragement. Asked by Lloyd-Jones when he would write another book, Lewis replied, "When I understand the meaning of prayer."{{sfn|Murray|1990}}{{Rp | needed = yes|date=March 2012}}

{{Citation needed span|The ''[[Space Trilogy]]'' (also called the ''Cosmic Trilogy'' or ''Ransom Trilogy'') dealt with what Lewis saw as the dehumanising trends in contemporary science fiction. The first book, ''[[Out of the Silent Planet]]'', was apparently written following a conversation with his friend J.R.R. Tolkien about these trends. Lewis agreed to write a "space travel" story and Tolkien a "time travel" one, but Tolkien never completed "[[The Lost Road and Other Writings|The Lost Road]]", linking his [[Middle-earth]] to the modern world. Lewis's main character [[Elwin Ransom]] is based in part on Tolkien, a fact to which Tolkien alludes in his letters.|date=November 2016}}

{{Citation needed span|The second novel, ''[[Perelandra]]'', depicts a new [[Garden of Eden]] on the planet Venus, a new [[Adam and Eve]], and a new "serpent figure" to tempt Eve. The story can be seen as an account of what might have happened if the terrestrial Adam had defeated the serpent and avoided the [[Fall of Man]], with Ransom intervening in the novel to "ransom" the new Adam and Eve from the deceptions of the enemy. The third novel, ''[[That Hideous Strength]]'', develops the theme of nihilistic science threatening traditional human values, embodied in Arthurian legend.|date=November 2016}}

Many ideas in the trilogy, particularly opposition to dehumanization as portrayed in the third book, are presented more formally in ''[[The Abolition of Man]]'', based on a series of lectures by Lewis at [[Durham University]] in 1943. Lewis stayed in Durham, where he says he was overwhelmed by the magnificence of [[Durham Cathedral|the cathedral]]. ''That Hideous Strength'' is in fact set in the environs of "Edgestow" university, a small English university like Durham, though Lewis disclaims any other resemblance between the two.{{sfn|Lewis|1945|page=}}{{Rp | needed = yes|date=March 2012}}

[[Walter Hooper]], Lewis's literary executor, discovered a fragment of another science-fiction novel apparently written by Lewis called ''[[The Dark Tower (1977 novel)|The Dark Tower]]''. Ransom appears in the story but it is not clear whether the book was intended as part of the same series of novels. The manuscript was eventually published in 1977, though Lewis scholar [[Kathryn Lindskoog]] doubts its authenticity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Washburn|first1=Jim|title=Literary Sleuth : Scholar Kathryn Lindskoog of Orange, author of 'Fakes, Frauds and Other Malarkey,' opened a can of worms by claiming a C.S.

[[File:Mourne mountains.jpg|thumb|[[Mourne Mountains|The Mountains of Mourne]] inspired Lewis to write ''The Chronicles of Narnia''.

''[[The Chronicles of Narnia]]'' is a series of seven fantasy novels for children and is considered a classic of children's literature. Written between 1949 and 1954 and illustrated by [[Pauline Baynes]], the series is Lewis's most popular work, having sold over 100 million copies in 41 languages {{Harvard citation|Kelly|2006|pp=}} {{Harvard citation|Guthmann|2005|pp=}}. {{Citation needed span|It has been adapted several times, complete or in part, for radio, television, stage and [[The Chronicles of Narnia (film series)|cinema]].|date=November 2016}}

In addition to Christian themes, Lewis also borrows characters from [[Greek mythology|Greek]] and [[Roman mythology]], as well as traditional British and Irish fairy tales.|date=November 2016}}

====Other works====
Lewis wrote several works on [[Heaven]] and [[Hell]]. One of these, ''[[The Great Divorce]]'', is a short novella in which a few residents of Hell take a bus ride to Heaven, where they are met by people who dwell there. The proposition is that they can stay if they choose, in which case they can call the place where they had come from "[[Purgatory]]", instead of "Hell", but many find it not to their taste. The title is a reference to [[William Blake]]'s ''[[The Marriage of Heaven and Hell]]'', a concept that Lewis found a "disastrous error". This work deliberately echoes two other more famous works with a similar theme: the ''[[Divine Comedy]]'' of [[Dante Alighieri]], and Bunyan's ''[[The Pilgrim's Progress]]''.

Another short work, ''[[The Screwtape Letters]]'', consists of letters of advice from senior [[demon]] Screwtape to his nephew Wormwood on the best ways to tempt a particular human and secure his [[Damnation#Religious|damnation]]. Lewis's last novel was ''[[Till We Have Faces]]'', which he thought of as his most mature and masterly work of fiction but which was never a popular success. It is a retelling of the myth of [[Cupid and Psyche]] from the unusual perspective of Psyche's sister. It is deeply concerned with religious ideas, but the setting is entirely [[paganism|pagan]], and the connections with specific Christian beliefs are left implicit.{{Citation needed|reason=standardized earlier cn request beginning with unreffed info halway up in previous paragraph|date=November 2016}}

Before Lewis's conversion to Christianity, he published two books: ''[[Spirits in Bondage]]'', a collection of poems, and ''[[Dymer]]'', a single [[narrative poetry|narrative poem]]. Both were published under the pen name Clive Hamilton. Other narrative poems have since been published posthumously, including ''Launcelot'', ''The Nameless Isle'', and ''[[The Queen of Drum]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Narrative Poems. |first=C. S. |last=Lewis |edition=Walter Hooper  |publisher=Fount Paperbacks |location=London |date=1969}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He also wrote ''[[The Four Loves]]'', which rhetorically explains four categories of love: [[philia|friendship]], [[Eros (concept)|eros]], [[storge|affection]], and [[agape|charity]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}}

In 2009, a partial draft was discovered of ''[[Language and Human Nature]]'', which Lewis had begun co-writing with J. R. R. Tolkien, but which was never completed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.txstate.edu/news/news_releases/news_archive/2009/07/CSLewis070809.html |title=Beebe discovers unpublished C.S.

===Christian apologist===
Lewis is also regarded by many as one of the most influential [[Christian apologetics|Christian apologists]] of his time, in addition to his career as an English professor and an author of fiction. ''[[Mere Christianity]]'' was voted best book of the twentieth century by ''[[Christianity Today]]'' in 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |url=http://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2000/april24/5.92.html |title=Books of the Century |date=24 April 2000 |volume=44 |issue=5 |page=92 | access-date=7 October 2010}}{{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has been called "The Apostle to the Skeptics" due to his approach to religious belief as a sceptic, and his following conversion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=CS Lewis: Apostle to the Skeptics|url=https://books.google.bg/books/about/C_S_Lewis_apostle_to_the_skeptics.html?id=3qANAQAAMAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lewis was very interested in presenting a [[Argument from reason|reasonable case]] for Christianity. ''Mere Christianity'', ''[[The Problem of Pain]]'', and ''[[Miracles (book)|Miracles]]'' were all concerned, to one degree or another, with refuting popular objections to Christianity, such as the question, "How could a good God allow pain to exist in the world?" He also became a popular lecturer and broadcaster, and some of his writing originated as scripts for radio talks or lectures (including much of ''Mere Christianity'').{{sfn|Lewis|1997|page=}}{{Rp | needed = yes|date=March 2012}}

According to George Sayer, losing a 1948 debate with [[G. E. M. Anscombe|Elizabeth Anscombe]], also a Christian, led Lewis to re-evaluate his role as an apologist, and his future works concentrated on devotional literature and children's books.&lt;ref name = rilstone-refuted&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.aslan.demon.co.uk/cslfaq.htm#_Toc5085891 |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20021202084439/http://www.aslan.demon.co.uk/cslfaq.htm#_Toc5085891 |archivedate=2 December 2002 |title=Were Lewis's proofs of the existence of God from 'Miracles' refuted by Elizabeth Anscombe? |work=Frequently Asked Questions | publisher = Alt.books.cs-lewis |first=Andrew |last=Rilstone |authorlink=Andrew Rilstone}}&lt;/ref&gt; Anscombe had a completely different recollection of the debate's outcome and its emotional effect on Lewis.&lt;ref name=rilstone-refuted /&gt; Victor Reppert also disputes Sayer, listing some of Lewis's post-1948 apologetic publications, including the second and revised edition of his ''Miracles'' in 1960, in which Lewis addressed Anscombe's criticism.&lt;ref name="Reppert 2005 https://books.google.com/books?id=hn1gaNlri1cC&amp;pg=PA266 266"&gt;{{Cite book | first =Victor |last=Reppert |authorlink= Victor Reppert |chapter= The Green Witch and the Great Debate: Freeing Narnia from the Spell of the Lewis-Anscombe Legend |chapterurl= https://books.google.com/books?id=hn1gaNlri1cC&amp;pg=PA260 |editor= Gregory Bassham and Jerry L.

Certainly Anscombe herself believed that Lewis's argument, though flawed, was getting at something very important; she thought that this came out more in the improved version of it that Lewis presented in a subsequent edition of ''Miracles''&amp;nbsp;– though that version also had 'much to criticize in it'."{{Cite quote|date=October 2018}}

Lewis also wrote an autobiography titled ''Surprised by Joy'', which places special emphasis on his own conversion. (It was written before he met his wife, Joy Gresham; the title of the book came from the first line of a poem by [[William Wordsworth]].) His essays and public speeches on Christian belief, many of which were collected in ''[[God in the Dock]]'' and ''[[The Weight of Glory and Other Addresses]]'', remain popular today.|date=November 2016}}

His most famous works, the ''Chronicles of Narnia'', contain many strong Christian messages and are often considered [[allegory]]. Lewis, an expert on the subject of allegory, maintained that the books were not allegory, and preferred to call the Christian aspects of them "[[supposition]]al". As Lewis wrote in a letter to a Mrs. Hook in December 1958:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
If Aslan represented the immaterial Deity in the same way in which Giant Despair &lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;a character in ''[[The Pilgrim's Progress]]''&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt; represents despair, he would be an allegorical figure. In reality, he is an invention giving an imaginary answer to the question, 'What might Christ become like, if there really were a world like Narnia and He chose to be incarnate and die and rise again in that world as He actually has done in ours?' This is not allegory at all.{{sfn|Martindale|Root|1990|pp=}}
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===="Trilemma"====
{{Main|Lewis's trilemma}}
In a much-cited passage from ''Mere Christianity'', Lewis challenged the view that Jesus was a great moral teacher but not God. He argued that Jesus made several implicit claims to divinity, which would logically exclude that claim:

{{quote|I am trying here to prevent anyone saying the really foolish thing that people often say about Him: 'I'm ready to accept Jesus as a great moral teacher, but I don't accept his claim to be God.' That is the one thing we must not say. A man who was merely a man and said the sort of things Jesus said would not be a great moral teacher. He would either be a lunatic&amp;nbsp;– on the level with the man who says he is a poached egg&amp;nbsp;– or else he would be the Devil of Hell. You must make your choice. Either this man was, and is, the Son of God, or else a madman or something worse. You can shut him up for a fool, you can spit at him and kill him as a demon or you can fall at his feet and call him Lord and God, but let us not come with any patronising nonsense about his being a great human teacher. He has not left that open to us. He did not intend to.{{sfn|Lewis|1997|p=43}}}}

Although this argument is sometimes called "Lewis's trilemma", Lewis did not invent it but rather developed and popularized it. It has also been used by Christian apologist [[Josh McDowell]] in his book ''More Than a Carpenter''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citation|McDowell|2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been widely repeated in Christian apologetic literature, but largely ignored by professional theologians and biblical scholars.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |first=Stephen T. |last=Davis |chapter=Was Jesus Mad, Bad, or God? |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=xLtu0IwjK5oC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;cad=0#PPA221,M1 |editor=Stephen T.

Lewis's Christian apologetics, and this argument in particular, have been criticised. Philosopher John Beversluis described Lewis's arguments as "textually careless and theologically unreliable",&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |first=John |last=Beversluis |title=C. S. Lewis and the Search for Rational Religion |publisher=[[W. B. Eerdmans]] |location=Grand Rapids, Michigan |year=1985 |isbn=0-8028-0046-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; and this particular argument as logically unsound and an example of [[false dilemma]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |first=John |last=Beversluis |title=C.

T. Wright]] criticises Lewis for failing to recognise the significance of Jesus' Jewish identity and setting&amp;nbsp;– an oversight which "at best, drastically short-circuits the argument" and which lays Lewis open to criticism that his argument "doesn't work as history, and it backfires dangerously when historical critics question his reading of the gospels", although he believes this "doesn't undermine the eventual claim".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite magazine |first=N.

Lewis used a similar argument in ''[[The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe]]'', when [[Digory Kirke|the old Professor]] advises the young heroes that their sister's claims of a magical world must logically be taken as either lies, madness, or truth.&lt;ref name="Reppert 2005 https://books.google.com/books?id=hn1gaNlri1cC&amp;pg=PA266 266" /&gt;

====Universal morality====
One of the main theses in Lewis's apologia is that there is a common morality known throughout humanity, which he calls "[[natural law]]". In the first five chapters of ''Mere Christianity'' Lewis discusses the idea that people have a standard of behaviour to which they expect people to adhere. Lewis claims that people all over the earth know what this law is and when they break it. He goes on to claim that there must be someone or something behind such a universal set of principles.{{sfn|Lindskoog|2001|p=144}}
&lt;blockquote&gt;
These then are the two points that I wanted to make. First, that human beings, all over the earth, have this curious idea that they ought to behave in a certain way, and cannot really get rid of it. Secondly, that they do not in fact behave in that way. They know the Law of Nature; they break it. These two facts are the foundation of all clear thinking about ourselves and the universe we live in.{{sfn|Lewis|1997|p=21}}
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Lewis also portrays Universal Morality in his works of fiction. In ''The Chronicles of Narnia'' he describes Universal Morality as the "deep magic" which everyone knew.{{sfn|Lindskoog|2001|p=146}}

In the second chapter of ''Mere Christianity'' Lewis recognises that "many people find it difficult to understand what this Law of Human Nature&amp;nbsp;... is." And he responds first to the idea "that the Moral Law is simply our herd instinct" and second to the idea "that the Moral Law is simply a social convention". In responding to the second idea Lewis notes that people often complain that one set of moral ideas is better than another, but that this actually argues for there existing some "Real Morality" to which they are comparing other moralities. Finally he notes that sometimes differences in moral codes are exaggerated by people who confuse differences in beliefs about morality with differences in beliefs about facts:

{{quote |I have met people who exaggerate the differences, because they have not distinguished between differences of morality and differences of belief about facts. For example, one man said to me, "Three hundred years ago people in England were putting witches to death. Was that what you call the Rule of Human Nature or Right Conduct?" But surely the reason we do not execute witches is that we do not believe there are such things. If we did&amp;nbsp;– if we really thought that there were people going about who had sold themselves to the devil and received supernatural powers from him in return and were using these powers to kill their neighbours or drive them mad or bring bad weather, surely we would all agree that if anyone deserved the death penalty, then these filthy [[quisling]]s did. There is no difference of moral principle here: the difference is simply about matter of fact. It may be a great advance in knowledge not to believe in witches: there is no moral advance in not executing them when you do not think they are there. You would not call a man humane for ceasing to set mousetraps if he did so because he believed there were no mice in the house.{{sfn|Lewis|1997|p=26}}}}

Lewis also had fairly progressive views on the topic of "animal morality", in particular the suffering of animals, as is evidenced by several of his essays: most notably, ''On Vivisection''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=C. S. |last=Lewis |title=Vivisection by CS&lt;!--sic--&gt; Lewis |publisher=Irish Anti-Vivisection Society |access-date=2 August 2009 |url=http://www.irishantivivisection.org/cslewis.html |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080516055451/http://www.irishantivivisection.org/cslewis.html |archivedate=16 May 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and "On the Pains of Animals".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite magazine |title=C.

Lewis and the Gender Debates'', Mary Stewart Van Leeuwen finds in Lewis's work "a hierarchical and essentialist view of class and gender" corresponding to an Edwardian upbringing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Van Leeuwen |first=Mary Stewart |title=A Sword between the Sexes? C. S. Lewis and the Gender Debates |location=Grand Rapids |publisher=Brazos Press |year=2010 |page=247 |isbn=978-1-58743-208-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most of Lewis's posthumous work has been edited by his literary executor [[Walter Hooper]]. [[Kathryn Lindskoog]], an independent Lewis scholar, argued that Hooper's scholarship is not reliable and that he has made false statements and attributed forged works to Lewis.{{sfn|Lindskoog|2001}} C. S. Lewis's stepson [[Douglas Gresham]] denies the forgery claims, saying, "The whole controversy thing was engineered for very personal reasons&amp;nbsp;... Her fanciful theories have been pretty thoroughly discredited."{{sfn|Gresham|2007}}

A bronze statue of Lewis's character Digory from ''The Magician's Nephew'' stands in Belfast's [[Holywood]] Arches in front of the Holywood Road Library.{{sfn|BBC News|2004}}

Several C. S. Lewis Societies exist around the world, including one which was founded in Oxford in 1982 to discuss papers on the life and works of Lewis and the other Inklings, and generally appreciate all things Lewisian.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://lewisinoxford.googlepages.com |title=Oxford University C.

'''Chronocentrism''' is the assumption that certain time periods (typically the [[present]]) are better, more important, or a more significant frame of reference than other time periods, either past or future.

==History==
Chronocentrism (from the Greek ''[[wikt:chrono-|chrono-]]'' meaning "time") was coined by sociologist Jib Fowles in an article in the journal ''Futures'' in February, 1974. Fowles described chronocentrism as "the belief that one's own times are paramount, that other periods pale in comparison".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Fowles |first1=Jib |title=On Chronocentrism |work=Futures |volume=6 |number=1 |doi=10.1016/0016-3287(74)90008-1 |date=February 1974 |page=249}}&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, it has been defined as "the egotism that one's own generation is poised on the very cusp of history".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Standage |first=Tom |authorlink=Tom Standage |title=[[The Victorian Internet|The Victorian Internet: The Remarkable Story of the Telegraph and the Nineteenth Century's On-line Pioneers]] |year=2007 |publisher=Walker &amp; Company |isbn=0-8027-1604-0 |pages=256}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The term had been used earlier in a study about attitudes to ageing in the workplace. Chronocentricity: "...only seeing the value of one's own age cohort...described the tendency for younger managers to hold negative perceptions of the abilities or other work-related competencies of older employees."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Lyon |first1=Phil |last2=Pollard |first2=D|title=Perceptions of the older employee: is anything really changing?|journal=Personnel Review|volume=26 |number=4 |doi=10.1108/00483489710172051|date=1 January 1997 |page=249}}&lt;/ref&gt; This type of discrimination is a form of [[ageism]].

==Ethnocentrism==

Chronocentrism as [[ethnocentrism]] is the perceiving and judging of a culture's historical values in terms of the standards of one's own time period.

==Antichronocentrism==

The [[Long Now Foundation]] is an organization that encourages the use of 5-digit years, e.g. "02016" instead of "2016," to help emphasize how early the present time is in their vision of the timeline of humanity.  The use of two-digit years before [[Y2K]] was an example of chronocentrism (in the early years of computing, the years 2000 and 1899 were believed to be too far in the future or the past, and thus of less importance than being able to save two digits in computerizing and typing out years).

==In science==
The "Copernican time principle" is a temporal analog of the [[Copernican principle]] for space, which states that no spatial location is any more or less special of a frame of reference than any other spatial location (i.e., that our physical universe has no center). Some authors have extended this to also include that no point in time is any more or less special than any other point in time (e.g., in outdated [[steady-state theories]]), though this cannot be universally applied (e.g., the [[Big-Bang singularity]] is a special point in time that can be logically used as a frame of reference to date later events.)

'''Commensurability''' is a concept in the [[philosophy of science]] whereby [[Scientific theory|scientific theories]] are commensurable if scientists can discuss them using a shared [[nomenclature]] that allows direct comparison of theories to determine which theory is [[scientific realism|more valid or useful]].  On the other hand, theories are '''incommensurable''' if they are embedded in starkly contrasting [[Paradigm|conceptual frameworks]] whose languages do not overlap sufficiently to permit scientists to directly compare the theories or to cite [[empirical evidence]] favoring one theory over the other.  Discussed by [[Ludwik Fleck]] in the 1930s,&lt;ref&gt;[https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/fleck/ Ludwik Fleck (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy)]; Fleck's term for incommensurability was "''niewspółmierność''".&lt;/ref&gt; and popularized by [[Thomas Kuhn]] in the 1960s, the problem of incommensurability results in scientists talking past each other, as it were, while comparison of theories is muddled by confusions about terms, contexts and consequences.

== Introduction of the term ==

In 1962, [[Thomas Kuhn]] and [[Paul Feyerabend]] both independently introduced the idea of incommensurability to the philosophy of science. In both cases the [[concept]] came from [[mathematics]] and in its original sense is defined as the absence of a common unit of measurement that would allow a direct and exact measurement of two [[variable (research)|variables]], such as the prediction of the [[diagonal]] of a [[square (geometry)|square]] from the relationship of its [[Edge (geometry)|sides]].

The term commensurability was coined because of a series of problems that both authors found when trying to interpret successive scientific [[theories]]. Without doubt its implementation is better understood thanks to the critiques that both Kuhn and Feyerabend have made in response to certain [[thesis|theses]] proposed by followers of the [[received view of theories]]. These include the famous ''thesis on the accumulation of scientific knowledge'', which states that the body of [[scientific knowledge]] has been increasing with the passage of time. Both Kuhn and Feyerabend reject this thesis, in favor of a [[scientific modelling|model]] that sees both [[Paradigm shift|revolutions]] and periods of [[Normal science|normalcy]] in the [[history of science]].

Another equally important thesis proposes the existence of a [[standard language|neutral language]] of comparison which can be used to formulate the [[empiricism|empirical consequences]] of two competing theories. This would allow one to choose the theory with the greatest empirically verified contents or explanatory powers &amp;ndash; or the greatest content that is not falsified if the formulation is [[Karl Popper|Popperian]].

The idea at the root of this second thesis does not just relate to the existence of said language but also implies at least two further postulates.{{original research inline|date=March 2015}} Firstly, this choice between theories presupposes that they can be intertranslated, for example between theory A and its successor B – and in the case of Popper that B can be deduced from A. Secondly, it is assumed that the choice is always carried out under the same standards of [[rationality]].

In both cases the concept of incommensurability makes the viability of the thesis impossible. In the first, by showing that certain empirical consequences are lost between successive theories. In the second case, by confirming that it is possible to make a rational choice between theories even when they can not be translated into a neutral language. However, although the reasons for the introduction of these counter arguments, and the criticism from which they arise, are the same, the sense in which the coauthors use them are in no way identical. For this reason the idea of incommensurability will be discussed for each coauthor separately.

== Perspectives ==

=== Feyerabend's perspectives ===
Feyerabend locates incommensurability within a principle from the field of [[semantics]] which has the underlying idea that the change in significance in the basic terms of a theory changes the totality of the terms of the new theory, so that there are no empirically common meanings between T and T'.

Feyerabend is credited with coining the modern philosophical sense of "incommensurability,"&lt;ref&gt;[[Bas Van Fraassen|Van Fraassen]], Bas. ''The Empirical Stance''. Yale UP: 2002. p. 114.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Oberheim and Hoyningen-Huene. [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/incommensurability/#FeyRouInc "The Incommensurability of Scientific Theories"] in ''The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy''. "...he had developed his notion of the incommensurability of scientific theories more than ten years prior to the appearance of Kuhn's Structure of Scientific Revolutions (1962)"&lt;/ref&gt; which lays the foundation for much of his philosophy of science. He first presented his notion of incommensurability in 1952 to [[Karl Popper]]'s [[London School of Economics]] seminar and to a gathering of illustrious Wittgensteinians ([[Elizabeth Anscombe]], [[Peter Geach]], [[H. L. A. Hart]] and [[Georg Henrik von Wright]]) in [[G. E. M. Anscombe|Anscombe's]] Oxford flat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/feyerabend/|title = Paul Feyerabend |accessdate=4 February 2012|author = Preston, John|date = 1 June 2009|publisher = [[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Feyerabend argued that frameworks of thought, and thus [[scientific paradigm]]s, can be incommensurable for three reasons. Briefly put, Feyerabend's notion of incommensurability is as follows:
# The interpretation of observations is implicitly influenced by theoretical assumptions. It is therefore impossible to describe or evaluate observations independently of theory.
# Paradigms often have different assumptions about which intellectual and operational scientific methods result in valid scientific knowledge.
# Paradigms can be based on different assumptions regarding the structure of their domain, which makes it impossible to compare them in a meaningful way. The adoption of a new theory includes and is dependent upon the adoption of new terms. Thus, scientists are using different terms when talking about different theories. Those who hold different, competing theories to be true will be talking over one another, in the sense that they cannot a priori arrive at agreement given two different discourses with two different theoretical language and dictates.

According to Feyerabend, the idea of incommensurability cannot be captured in [[formal logic]], because it is a phenomenon outside of logic's domain.

==== Theories ====
In 1989, Feyerabend presented an idea informed by Popper's [[critical rationalism]] whereby "investigation starts with a problem. The problem is the result of a conflict between an expectation and an observation, which, in its turn, is formed by the expectation." (Feyerabend, 1989; pp.&amp;nbsp;96). [[Scientific method]]ology then resolves problems by inventing theories that should be relevant and falsifiable, at least to a greater degree than any other alternative solution. Once an alternative theory is presented the critical phase commences regarding T' which must answer the following questions: (a) why has theory T been successful up until now and (b) why has it failed. If the new theory T' answers both questions then T is discarded.

That is, a new theory T', in order to be an adequate successor to the refuted theory T, must have a collection of additional predictions regarding T (Class A), as well as a collection of successful predictions that coincide to a certain degree with the old theory (Class S). These Class S predictions constitute those parts of the new theory containing new truths and they therefore exclude a series of consequences of T, the failures in the old theory, which are part of the untrue (false) contents of the new theory (Class F).

Given this model it is possible to construct [[Relational theory|relational statements]] between certain terms from T and from T', which will be the basis for the comparison between the theories. This will allow a choice between the two in the light of their empirical contents. But, if we come across a theory T' in which Class S is empty then the theories are incommensurable with each other.

However, Feyerabend clarifies this by stating that, incommensurability between T and T' will depend on the interpretation given to the theories. If this is instrumental, every theory that refers to the same language of [[observation]] will be commensurable. In the same way, if a [[Philosophical realism|realist]] perspective is sought then it will favour a unified position which employs the most highly abstracted terms of whatever theory is being considered in order to describe both theories, giving a significance to the observational statements as a function of these terms, or, at least to replace the habitual use they are given.

It can be noted that the instrumentalist interpretation recognizes the existence of certain statements whose truth is not only dependent on the observational statements but also on the evaluation criteria they are subjected to, which are anchored in the theories. For example, to afirm the relational character of [[longitude]], this asseveration can not be decided solely using observational terms. Its truth value, in part, depends on the theory that establishes the sense in which the terms are used. In this case they relate to [[quantum mechanics]] (QM) as opposed to [[classical mechanics]] (CM). In this sense, the instrumentalist position only deals with the empirical consequences and leaves to one side the relationship that the concepts have with each other.

In this same way Feyerabend comments that:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/13238504|title=Philosophical papers|last=Feyerabend|first=Paul|date=1985|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=|isbn=0521316421|edition=1st|location=Cambridge|pages=|oclc=13238504}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|It is certain, of course, that the relativist scheme has very often given us numbers that are practically identical to the numbers obtained from CM, but this does not mean that the concepts are very similar...[For] even if ...yielding strictly identical predictions can be used as an argument to show that the concepts must match, at least in this case, different magnitudes based on different concepts can give identical values for their respective scales while being different magnitudes...[So] it is not possible to make a comparison of the contents, nor is it possible to make a judgement regarding its verisimilitude.|[[Paul Feyerabend]]}}

==== Realist objections ====

In relation to realist objections, Feyerabend returns to an [[argument]] elaborated by [[Carnap]] and comments that the use of such abstract concepts leads to an impossible position, as "...theoretical terms receive their interpretation by being connected with an observational language and those terms are empty without that connection." (Feyerabend, pp.&amp;nbsp;373). As before it follows that they can not be used to confer significance to the observational language as this observational language is its only source of significance, with which it is not possible to make a translation but only a restatement of the term.

Therefore, Feyerabend considers that both the instrumentalist and the realist interpretations are flawed, as they try to defend the idea that incommensurability is a legitimately unsolvable idea with which to revoke the theses of the accumulation of knowledge and [[panrationalism]] in science. 
 
This leads to the following consideration: if each new theory has its own observational basis, within the meaning of the theoretical framework, how can we hope that the observations that are produced could eventually refute it. Furthermore, how can we actually recognize that the new position explains what it is supposed to explain or if it is deviating off into other areas and therefore how can the theories be definitively compared.

Feyerabend's answer to the first consideration lies in noting that the initial terms of a theory depend on the postulates of the theory and their associated grammatical rules, in addition, the predictions derived from the theory also depend on the underlying conditions of the system. Feyerabend doesn't explore the point further, but it can be assumed that if the prediction does not agree with the observation and if we have a high degree of confidence in the description that we have made from the initial [[material conditional|conditions]] than we can be sure that the error must be present in our theory and in its underlying terms. 
 
In dealing with the second consideration Feyerabend asks "why should it be necessary to have a [[terminology]] that allows us to say that two theories refer to the same experiment. This supposes a unificationist or possibly a realist aspiration, whose objective appears to be the truth, however, it is assumed that the theory can be compared under a criterion of empirical adequacy. Such an approach would build on the relationship established between the observational statement that describes the outcome of an experiment formulated for each theory independently, which is compared with the predictions that each theory posits. In this way the selection is made when a theory is an empirically better fit. If the objection to the possible deviation of the new theory is not answered it is irrelevant as often history has shown that in fact differing points of view change or modify their fields of application, for example the physics of [[Aristotle]] and [[Isaac Newton|Newton]]."

==== Theory selection ====
{{See also|Models of scientific inquiry#Choice of a theory}}
The above implies that the process of choosing between theories does not obey a universal rationality. Feyerabend has the following view regarding whether the absence of a universal rationality constitutes an irrational position:

{{quote|No, because each individual event is rational in the sense that some of its features can be explained by reasons that are or were accepted at the time in which they occurred, or that were invented in the course of their development. Yes, because even these local reasons, which change over time, are not sufficient to explain all the important features of a particular event.|[[Paul Feyerabend]]|source={{citation needed|date=April 2016}}}}

Feyerabend uses this reasoning to try to shed light on one of Popper's arguments, which says that we are always able to change any statement, even those reference systems that guide our critical thinking. However, the two thinkers reach different conclusions, Popper assumes that it is always possible to make a criticism once the new criteria have been accepted, so the selection can be seen as the result of a rationality "''[[Empirical evidence|a posteriori]]''" to the selection. While, Feyerabend's position is that this solution is merely a verbal ornament whenever the standards are influenced by Popper's first world, the physical world, and they are not just developed in the third world. That is, the standards are influenced by the expectations of their originators, the stances they imply and the ways of interpreting the world they favour, but this is strictly analogous to the same process of the scientific revolution, that leads us to believe that the thesis of incommensurability can also be applied to standards, as is shown by the following asseveration:

{{quote|Even the most puritanical rationalist will be forced to stop arguing and use propaganda, for example, not because some of their arguments have become invalid, but because the psychological conditions have disappeared that allowed effective argument and therefore influence over the others|[[Paul Feyerabend]]|source={{citation needed|date=April 2016}}}}

Feyerabend states that the Popperian criticism is either related to certain clearly defined procedures, or is totally abstract and leaves others with the task of fleshing it out later with specific contents, making Popper's rationality a "mere verbal ornament." This does not imply that Feyerabend is an [[irrationalist]] but that he considers that the process of scientific change can not be explained in its totality in the light of some rationality, precisely because of incommensurability.

=== Kuhn's perspectives ===
The second coauthor of the thesis of incommensurability is [[Thomas Kuhn]], who introduced it in his 1962 book, ''[[The structure of scientific revolutions]]'', in which he describes it as a universal property that defines the relationship between successive [[paradigm]]s. Under this meaning incommensurability goes beyond the field of semantics and covers everything relating to its practical application, from the study of problems to the associated methods and rules for their resolution. However, the meaning of the term was continually refined throughout Kuhn's work, he first placed it within the field of semantics and applied a narrow definition, but later he redefined it in a [[Taxonomy (general)|taxonomic]] sense, wherein changes are found in the relationships between similarities and differences that the subjects of a defining matrix draw over the world.

In The Structure of Scientific Revolutions Kuhn wrote that "the historian of science may be tempted to exclaim that when paradigms change, the world itself changes with them".&lt;ref name=SSR/&gt;{{rp|111}} According to Kuhn, the proponents of different scientific paradigms cannot fully appreciate or understand the other's point of view because they are, as a way of speaking, living in different worlds. Kuhn gave three reasons for this inability:
# Proponents of competing paradigms have different ideas about the importance of solving various scientific problems, and about the standards that a solution should satisfy.
# The vocabulary and problem-solving methods that the paradigms use can be different: the proponents of competing paradigms utilize a different conceptual network.
# The proponents of different paradigms see the world in a different way because of their scientific training and prior experience in research.

In a postscript (1969) to ''[[The Structure of Scientific Revolutions]]'', Kuhn added that he thought that incommensurability was, at least in part, a consequence of the role of [[similarity sets]] in normal science. Competing paradigms group concepts in different ways, with different similarity relations. According to Kuhn, this causes fundamental problems in communication between proponents of different paradigms. It is difficult to change such categories in one's mind, because the groups have been learned by means of exemplars instead of definitions. This problem cannot be resolved by using a neutral language for communication, according to Kuhn, since the difference occurs prior to the application of language.

Kuhn's thinking on incommensurability was probably in some part influenced by his reading of [[Michael Polanyi]] who held that there can be a logical gap between belief systems and who also said that scientists from different schools, "think differently, speak a different language, live in a different world."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/1008553295|title=Personal knowledge : towards a post-critical philosophy|last=Polanyi|first=Michael|publisher=|year=|isbn=9780203442159|location=London|pages=151|oclc=1008553295}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Phases ====

Given his changing definition of incommensurability Pérez Ransanz has identified three phases in Kuhn's work, or at least in how it deals with this concept. As we have seen above the first phase was seen in ''The Structure of Scientific Revolutions'' (SSR) and it is characterized by an overall vision that is applied to paradigms. This perspective was replaced in the 1970s by a localist and semanticist vision in which incommensurability is now defined as the relationship between two theories that are articulated in two languages that are not completely interchangeable, as Kuhn states in the following extract:&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/756577696|title=The structure of scientific revolutions|last=Kuhn|first=Thomas S.|publisher=|others=Hacking, Ian,|year=|isbn=9780226458113|edition= Fourth|location=Chicago|pages=|oclc=756577696}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|The phrase "without common measure" is converted into "without common language". To state that two theories are incommensurable means that there is no neutral language, or other type of language, into which both theories, conceived as sets of statements, can be translated without remainder or loss... [Although] the majority of the terms shared by the two theories function in the same way in both...|[[Thomas Kuhn]]}}

The above only prohibits one type of comparison, that which is carried out between the statements of these two theories in a one-to-one relationship. An idea that underlies this formulation is that translation implies [[symmetry]] and [[transitive relation|transitivity]] so that if theory T is translatable with theory T', then T' can be translated to T, and furthermore if there is a third theory T'' and this can be translated to T', then theories T and T' cannot be incommensurable, as long as the transitive relationship and the symmetrical relationship assures that their statements can be compared one to another.

It should be noted that Kuhn did not deny that two incommensurable theories may have a common reference environment and in this sense he did not state that it was impossible to compare them, his thesis solely refers to the ability to translate the statements belonging to two theories in a one-to-one relationship, as is shown in the following passage:&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

{{quote|The terms that retain their meanings following a change in theory provide a suitable base for the discussion of the differences and for the comparisons that are relevant in the selection of theories. [Continued in a footnote] It may be noted that these terms are not independent of the theory, but they are simply used in the same way in the two theories in question. It follows that the comparison is a process that compares the two theories, it is not a process that can evaluate the theories separately.|[[Thomas Kuhn]]}}

This is relevant because it allow us to elucidate that Kuhn's sense of [[rationality]] is linked to the ability to comprehend, and not to the same capacity for translation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/43602287|title=Kuhn y el cambio científico|last=Pérez Ransanz|first=Ana Rosa|date=1999|publisher=Fondo de Cultura Económica|year=|isbn=9681641892|edition=1st|location=México|pages=|language=es|oclc=43602287}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the third stage of Kuhn's work the formulation of the thesis of incommensurability became refined in [[Taxonomy (general)|taxonomic]] terms and is explained as a function of the change in the relations of similarity and difference between two theories. Kuhn declared that this change relates to the concepts of Class A not only because there is a change in the way of referring to the concepts but also because their underlying structure becomes altered, that is, the meaning changes – its intention – but also its reference. In this way Kuhn states that not all of the semantic changes are changes that lead to incommensurability, they are only those that, by being made in the basic categories, operate in a [[Holism|holistic manner]] meaning that all the relationships between these terms becomes altered. This uses taxonomic terms to define incommensurability as the impossibility to prove the taxonomic structures of two theories, an impossibility that is expressed as a necessarily incomplete translation of the terms.

==== Taxonomic characterization ====

[[Taxonomy (biology)|Taxonomic]] characterization allowed Kuhn to postulate his no-overlap [[principle]], since, if the taxonomic categories are divisions in a logical sense then this implies that the relations established between these concepts and the rest are necessarily hierarchical. It is for exactly this type of relationship that the changes in categories are holistic, as the modification of a category necessarily implies the modification of the surrounding categories, which explains why once the change takes place the taxonomies can not be comparable – they are isomorphic. 
  
This characterization was already present in Kuhn's writing along with remnants of semantic characterization, which he developed in full towards the end of the 1980s in his taxonomic characterization. An advantage of this characterization is the belief that the criteria that allow the identification of a concept with its references are many and varied, so that a coincidence of criteria is not necessary for successful communication except for those categories that are implicated. Kuhn saw the relations between concepts as existing in a multidimensional space, the categories consist of partitions in this space and they must coincide between the communicators, although this is not the case for the criteria that establish a connection between this space and the associated reference.

==== Reluctance ====

An important clarification that should be made, and which constantly appears in Kuhn's writing, is his reluctance to equate translation and interpretation, a comparison that Kuhn attributes to the analytical tradition of [[philosophy]]. Translation is an almost mechanical activity which produces a Quinean translation manual that relates sequences of words in such a way that their truth values are conserved. However, the process of interpretation implies the development of translation hypotheses, which have to be successful when they allow external preferences to be understood in a coherent and meaningful way. Kuhn then rejected the idea of a universal translatability but not the principle of universal intelligibility, a distinction that is very important in understanding Kuhn's rejection of his critics, such as [[Karl Popper|Popper]] and [[Donald Davidson (philosopher)|Davidson]].

However, without a doubt the previous idea invites us to question how is it that we are able to interpret in the first place. Kuhn's solution consists in affirming that this is like learning a new language. How is it that we are able to learn a new language when we are confronted with a holistic change such as is implied by the notion of incommensurability? Kuhn's work suggests four aspects to this question:

* Firstly, in order to carry out such an [[assimilation (psychology)|assimilation]] it is necessary that the complementary [[vocabulary]] is easily understood.
* Secondly, definitions must fulfill a minimal role, it is the paradigmatic examples that introduce the use of the new concepts, in such a way that an ostensive or stipulative component is essential.
* Thirdly, [[Class (philosophy)|class concepts]] cannot be learned in isolation, but in relation to a series of contrast sets.
* Fourthly, the process of learning involves the generation of expectations, which are the basis of the projectability of the class terms, in such a way that in their turn they form the basis of, among other things, inductive inferences. And lastly, as the criteria for relating the class and its reference vary, this forms the way of learning the subject matter.

=== Conclusion ===

It can be concluded that Kuhn's idea of incommensurability, despite its various reformulations, manages to seriously problematize both the idea of accumulation of a neutral language as well as of the very idea of a neutral language, without falling into [[irrationalism]] nor stating that the common reference level is irrelevant. An idea that differentiates him from Feyerabend who states in books such as ''Problems of Empiricism'' and ''[[Against Method]]'' that if the new theory deviates into new areas, this is not a problem of the theory, as often the conceptual progress leads to the disappearance and not to the refutation or resolution of the old questions.

==Meta-incommensurability==
A more general notion of incommensurability has been applied to the sciences at the meta-level in two significant ways.

Eric Oberheim and [[Paul Hoyningen-Huene]] argue that [[Scientific realism|realist]] and [[Anti-realism#Anti-realism in science|anti-realist]] philosophies of science are also incommensurable, thus scientific theories themselves may be meta-incommensurable.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=OBERHEIM|first=Eric|last2=HOYNINGEN-HUENE|first2=Paul|date=1997|title=INCOMMENSURABILITY, REALISM AND META-INCOMMENSURABILITY|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/23917953|journal=Theoria: An International Journal for Theory, History and Foundations of Science|volume=12|issue=3(30)|pages=447–465}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly, Nicholas Best describes a different type of incommensurability between philosophical theories of [[Meaning (philosophy of language)|meaning]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Best|first=Nicholas W.|date=September 2015|title=Meta-Incommensurability between Theories of Meaning: Chemical Evidence|url=https://doi.org/10.1162/POSC_a_00176|journal=Perspectives on Science|language=en|volume=23|issue=3|pages=361–378|doi=10.1162/posc_a_00176|issn=1063-6145|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He argues that if the meaning of a first-order scientific theory depends on its second-order theory of meaning, then two first order theories will be meta-incommensurable if they depend on substantially different theories of meaning. Whereas Kuhn and Feyerabend’s concepts of incommensurability do not imply complete incomparability of scientific concepts, this incommensurability of meaning does.

According to the endurantist view, material objects are persisting three-dimensional individuals wholly present at every moment of their existence, which goes with an [[A-theory of time]]. This conception of an individual as always present is opposed to [[perdurantism]] or [[four dimensionalism]], which maintains that an object is a series of [[temporal parts]] or stages, requiring a [[B-theory of time]]. The use of "endure" and "perdure" to distinguish two ways in which an object can be thought to persist can be traced to [[David Lewis (philosopher)|David Lewis]].

The term "'''commitmentphobia'''" was coined in the popular self-help book ''Men Who Can't Love'' in 1987.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Men Who Can't Love|author= [[Steven A.

"The reconstitution of the family in the kibbutz." European Journal of Sociology 25.01 (1984): 1-27.&lt;/ref&gt;

The use of the term "fear" or "phobia" imparts an inherent linguistic bias. It recasts specific lifestyle decisions (such as [[bachelor]]hood vs. [[marriage]], or a conscious decision to remain [[childfree]] by choice) implicitly as generalised, irrational [[phobia]]s while failing to identify, describe or address an individual's specific motives. For instance, the [[men's rights movement]], citing high [[divorce]] rates and expensive [[alimony]] and legal costs, would speak not in terms of ''fear of commitment'' but of ''marriage strike'' to reflect their position that non-marriage is an entirely valid, logical position based on rational consideration of the very real economic factors involved.&lt;ref name="SacksThompson"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ifeminists.com/introduction/editorials/2002/0709a.html|title=Have Anti-Father Family Court Policies Led to a Men's Marriage Strike?|author=Glenn Sacks|authorlink=Glenn Sacks|author2=Dianna Thompson |date=2002-07-09|publisher=ifeminists.com|accessdate=2013-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=smith&gt;{{cite book|author=Helen Smith|title=Men on Strike: Why Men Are Boycotting Marriage, Fatherhood, and the American Dream-And Why It Matters|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9m6kMQEACAAJ|chapter=The Marriage Strike: why men don't marry|date=4 June 2013|publisher=ENCOUNTER BOOKS|isbn=978-1-59403-675-0|pages=1–39}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="McElroy"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,94415,00.html|title=The Marriage Strike|author=Wendy McElroy|authorlink=Wendy McElroy|date=2003-08-12|publisher=Fox News - Opinion|accessdate=2013-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Embryogenesis|development]] of [[Vertebrate|vertebrate animals]], the '''functional matrix hypothesis''' is a phenomenological description of bone growth.  It proposes that "the origin, development and maintenance of all skeletal units are secondary, compensatory and mechanically obligatory responses to temporally and operationally prior demands of related functional matrices."&lt;ref&gt;Salentijn, L. ''Functional anatomy of the head and neck'', [[Columbia University College of Dental Medicine]] post-graduate dental lecture series, 2009{{vs|date=April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The fundamental basis for this hypothesis, laid out by [[Columbia University College of Dental Medicine|Columbia]] [[Human anatomy|anatomy]] professor [[Melvin Moss]]  is that bones do not ''grow'' but ''are grown'',&lt;ref&gt;Fonseca, Raymond J. [https://books.google.com/books?id=XjLdFSotfiEC&amp;pg=PA246&amp;lpg=PA246&amp;dq=functional+matrix+theory&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=EDL48mQFLi&amp;sig=bzpqlQ9rJ9DTl3PUp0Xs26fw52g&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=GACvSvP_J422lAeBr7XmBg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=8#v=onepage&amp;q=functional%20matrix%20theory&amp;f=false Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery, Volume 6], p 246.&lt;/ref&gt; thus stressing the [[ontogeny|ontogenetic]] primacy of function over form.&lt;ref name="FHA"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Moss ML |title=The functional matrix hypothesis revisited. 3.

'''Gerhold K. Becker''' (born 22 July 1943) is a German philosopher.

==Biographical sketch==
Gerhold K. Becker grew up in [[Bad Salzschlirf]], Hesse, the eldest son of the violinist Josef Becker and his wife Agnes née Goldbach. After graduating from the humanistic high school at [[Fulda]], he studied [[philosophy]] and [[theology]] at universities in [[Frankfurt/Main]], [[University of Heidelberg|Heidelberg]], and [[Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich|Munich]], with, among others, [[Hans-Georg Gadamer]], [[Dieter Henrich]], Hermann Krings, [[Robert Spaemann]], Michael Theunissen, [[Ernst Tugendhat]] and Heinrich Fries, Alois Grillmeier, [[Wolfhart Pannenberg]], [[Karl Rahner]], Trutz Rendtorff and Eugen Biser, under whose direction he completed a summa cum laude dissertation on the thinking of [[Ernst Troeltsch]]. In 1975-1986 he taught at [[Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich|Munich University’s]] Institute for Christian World View and Philosophy of Religion. During this time he met his future wife, the musicologist and concert pianist [[Siglind Bruhn]]. In January 1986 he accepted a position at the Department of Religion and Philosophy of what is now [[Hong Kong Baptist University]]. In 1987 his wife joined him in Hong Kong, where she taught for six years at The [[University of Hong Kong]]. In 1991 Becker was asked to establish Hong Kong’s first [[Centre for Applied Ethics]] and become its founding director; in 1992, he was elected as an Ordinary Member to the [[European Academy of Sciences and Arts]]. From 1996-2004, he served on the Hong Kong Government’s Council on  [[Reproductive endocrinology and infertility|Human Reproductive Technology]], initially as a member, then as the chairman of its Ethics Committee. Since 2004 he is a regular visiting professor at the [[Graduate School of Philosophy and Religion]], [[Assumption University (Thailand)|Assumption University of Thailand]], [[Bangkok]].

'''Gregory Victor Loewen''' (born 1966) is a social philosopher in the traditions of [[hermeneutics]] and [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]]. The author of over twenty books, he is "the most prolific scholar of [[Generation X]]", and is age-relative one of a number of modern period academic writers to have produced a significant body of work early in their careers, along with [[Herder]], [[Edward de Bono|de Bono]], [[Afrikan Spir|Spir]], [[Joad]], [[Aguilera (philosopher)|Aguilera]], and [[Schelling]]. 

== Biography ==
Born in Victoria, January 31, 1966, Loewen was educated at the University of Victoria with a BA and MA in anthropology and at the University of British Columbia, receiving the PhD in anthropology in 1997. He held two tenure stream positions in the United States before taking up his academic position in Saskatoon, Canada, in 2005, where he was chair of the sociology department for five years and from which he retired in 2018. He lives on Vancouver Island and is married to the sociologist Jennifer Lynn Heller.

== Ideas ==
Loewen's work fits squarely in the overlapping traditions of hermeneutics and phenomenology, where it is assumed that all human perception is subject to variable comprehension and the coming to a shared understanding of texts, worldviews, and even natural objects and forces is an exercise in the arts and uses of language.

In ''Hermeneutic Pedagogy'', Loewen "aims to expound the educational process in the hermeneutical tradition, but is also an essay on the educational model the author calls the ''hermeneutical circle of experiential pedagogy''. Loewen elaborates a conception of learning which considers the dynamic relations between the conservative, the technical and the moral dimensions of education."&lt;ref name="Ione"&gt;{{cite web|last=Ionel|first=Lucian|title=Philosophy in the educational process: Understanding what cannot be taught|url=http://www.metajournal.org//articles_pdf/417-421recenzie-ionel-meta8-tehno.pdf%20|work=Metajournal|accessdate=2 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The book defines the relationships amongst hexis, or custom, praxis, or applied theory, and phronesis, the Aristotelian understanding of practical wisdom, to which the critical interpretive process of learning ultimately aims. "Custom is only a first step in the dialectical process of learning. Not only do we forget and alter what we are taught, but also come to contest. Customs are reinterpreted, theory adjusted to suit reality, the social reality of tradition is reshaped, and the episteme of the serious business of constructing knowledge takes on its new historical task." The second step of a learning process is ''praxis'' applied theory. Its aim is to expand knowledge, to use it for progressive purposes. The institutions, says Loewen, are now the medium through which a paradigm comes into being. While 'repetition' is the key word for ''hexis'' and 'extension' for ''praxis'', the process of learning fulfils itself in phronesis or practical knowledge. "While custom presents a ready-made reality for our consumption and oblation, and theory presents to us the revolution of consciousness that overturns that world, practical wisdom shines upon the light of worldliness, the way in which the world worlds itself." Through ''phronesis'' the hermeneutical circle of experiential pedagogy, as Loewen calls it, closes and accomplishes itself. It enlightens the other two constitutive dimensions, it puts them into question and reveals the abilities they do not capture, but which are central to the human being as a learning being. ''Phronesis'' names the radical learning experience that one individual has, experience which cannot be taught."&lt;ref name="Ione" /&gt; Loewen's (2003, 2004, 2012) studies of educational processes expose the tacit expectations and latent functions of institutions and discourses, and owe much to the pioneering works of [[Bourdieu]] and [[Passeron]]. But Loewen balances critique that is found within the dialectic with an attempt at reconstructing learning through the dialogue of hermeneutics.

Loewen's work on religion runs from general discussions of the relationships between science and religion, reason and faith (2008 and 2012),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=cf. also Fetish, Cult and Disenchantment: Sociological Studies of the Projected Self|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Fetish_Cult_and_Disenchantment.html?id=87DvtgAACAAJ&amp;redir_esc=y}}&lt;/ref&gt; to scholarly investigations into the hermeneutic dimensions of religious experience, and studies of [[William James]], [[Heidegger]], [[Weber]] and [[Durkheim]] (2009). His popular books have a distinctively Durkheimian tone. In ''What is God?'' Loewen asserts that it is the combination of human aspiration to be more than our mortality allows, along with the anxiety regarding that very same mortality that provides the subjective inclination for the religious life. The cultural necessity for religion is grounded in the need for human community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What is God? Musings on Human Anxiety and Aspiration|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYZrkg5UWRA|accessdate=2 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''On the Afterlife'', he presents a new comparative and historical model of beliefs in the purposes and meanings of life after death which calls into operation his anthropological training. He suggests that all known societies are categorized by one of five patterns, either thinking that the soul returns unevaluated to the world, it returns evaluated, it is evaluated and does not return, or it remains unevaluated and does not return. The conception of nothingness is a peculiarly modern understanding, but Loewen argues that it does not hamper our ethical efforts while we are alive to imagine that mortality comes to an abrupt and final halt. He concludes that each of these five models are aiming to remind us of the same human condition, one that he sees historically as presenting each of us both a gift and a task. His notion of 'phenomemnemonics', the study of objects by which we use to remember other experiences, also has particular relevance to the links between biography and religious traditions.

''Becoming a Modest Society'' distinguishes the uncritical and reflective meanings held within a number of oft confused pairs of concepts, including morals and ethics, prudence and prudishness, bravery and bravado, pessimism and skepticism and modesty and humility, amongst others. Loewen clearly favors conceptions of society that are critical, interpretive, and bring to the fore our shared human ability to not merely be curious about the social world, but to hone the ability to 'unexpect the expected' from ourselves and those around us, that is, to be suspicious of the routine relations that we observe in society as a whole, as well as between or amongst individuals. Loewen has developed several other phenomenological concepts that are then used in the analysis of political and social relations, including 'antigonality', which is encapsulated as "the politics of doubt, the doubting of politics".

The '''Hegel Archives''' (German: ''Hegel-Archiv'') were founded in 1958 in [[North Rhine-Westphalia]] to encourage historical-critical efforts to study the collected works of [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]].  

The North-Rhine/Westphalian Academy of Sciences and the Felix Meiner Publishing House, Hamburg, are publishers of the collected works of Hegel.  Since 1968 the Hegel Archives has served as a facility for the faculty of Philosophy, Education and Journalism of the [[Ruhr University Bochum]].

==Research==
Apart from publishing activity, the Hegel Archives also promotes Hegel research.  For example, it coordinates the following efforts:
#the yearbook of Hegel studies (''Hegel Studien'') that since 1961 has provided a forum for research papers and a new bibliography;
#its own writings and conferences;
#a special library building that covers the work of Hegel's students;
#an entire research literature beside Hegel's own works; and
#Hegel's own monographs.

This library is open to Hegel researchers and international guests as well.

==Director==
The Hegel Archives was founded in 1958 by [[Otto Pöggeler]], who is a German representant of [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]] and [[hermeneutics]].

The Director of the Hegel Archives is actually Professor [[Walter Jaeschke]], who is also the Editor of the publication of the Collected Works of Hegel.  He is also the author of ''Reason in Religion: the Foundation of Religion in Hegel's Philosophy'' (1986).

Professor Jaeschke also assisted Dr. [[Peter C. Hodgson]] and a team of scholars at the [[University of California at Berkeley]], who, in 1990, published a new translation of Hegel's ''[[Lectures on the Philosophy of Religion]] (1818-1831)''.  This publication radically changed the direction of 20th-century Hegel studies, according to some researchers in the [[Hegel Society of America]].

In the review ''Hegel Studien'' were published works by Otto Pöggeler, [[Ernst Bloch]], [[Hans-Georg Gadamer]], [[Martin Heidegger]], [[Karl Löwith]], [[Heinz Heimsoeth]], [[Dieter Henrich]], [[Annemarie Gethmann-Siefert]], [[Walter Jaeschke]], [[Robert Brandom]], [[John Sallis]], [[Robert Pippin]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.forschungszentrum-kdp.ruhr-uni-bochum.de/philosophy/forschung_kdp/hegel-studien.html.de Contents of Hegel Studien]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Henri Frédéric Amiel''' ({{IPA-fr|amjɛl|lang}}; 27 September 1821 – 11 May 1881) was a Swiss [[moral philosophy|moral philosopher]], poet, and critic.

==Biography==
Born in [[Geneva]] in 1821, he was descended from a [[Huguenot]] family driven to [[Switzerland]] by the revocation of the [[Edict of Nantes]].{{says who?|date=October 2018}}

After losing his parents at an early age, Amiel travelled widely, became intimate with the intellectual leaders of [[Europe]], and made a special study of [[German philosophy]] in [[Berlin]]. In 1849 he was appointed professor of aesthetics at the academy of Geneva, and in 1854 became professor of moral philosophy.

These appointments, conferred by the democratic party, deprived him of the support of the aristocratic party, whose patronage dominated all the culture of the city.  This isolation inspired the one book by which Amiel is still known, the ''Journal Intime'' ("Private Journal"), which, published after his death, obtained a European reputation.  It was translated into [[English language|English]] by British writer [[Mary Augusta Ward]] at the suggestion of academic [[Mark Pattison (academic)|Mark Pattison]].&lt;ref&gt;Sanders, Valerie (1996). ''Eve's Renegades: Victorian Anti-Feminist Women Novelists.'' New York: St. Martin's Press, p. 37.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although modest in volume of output, Amiel's ''Journal'' gained a sympathy that the author had failed to obtain in his life. In addition to the ''Journal'', he produced several volumes of [[poetry]] and wrote studies on [[Erasmus]], [[Madame de Stael]] and other writers. His extensive correspondence with Égérie, his muse name for Louise Wyder, was preserved and published in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;Henri Frédéric Amiel, Louise Wyder, Louis Vannieuwenborgh - 2004 Louise Wyder, " Égérie ", est l'une d'entre elles. Proche ou lointaine, elle a accompagné Amiel pendant près de trente-trois ans.&lt;/ref&gt;

He died in Geneva.

The phrase ''horizontal evolution'' is used in evolutionary biology to refer to:
* [[Concerted evolution]], whereby individual members of a DNA family within one species are more closely related to each other than to members of the same type of DNA family in other species;&lt;ref&gt;EG: ''"Primary sequence of baboon CR1 demonstrates concerted evolution within the CR1 gene"'', Clemenza et al. {{doi|10.1016/S0161-5890(97)00040-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Horizontal gene transfer]], where genes are transferred from one organism to another by means other than genes received from an ancestor&lt;ref&gt;EG: ''"Evolution of Aminoacyl-tRNA Synthetases—Analysis of Unique Domain Architectures and Phylogenetic Trees Reveals a Complex History of Horizontal Gene Transfer Events"'', Wolf et al. {{doi|10.1101/gr.9.8.689}}&lt;/ref&gt;
It is sometimes used by creationists as a synonym for
* [[Microevolution]], development of genetic changes below the speciation threshold &lt;ref&gt;EG: [http://www.icr.org/article/microwave-evolution/ ''"The Microwave of Evolution"''], Henry Morris, Institute for Creation Research&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Institute Vienna Circle''' (IVC) (''Society for the Advancement of the Scientific World Conception''), founded in October 1991 is an international [[nonprofit organization]]  which is dedicated to the work and influence of the [[Vienna Circle]] of [[Logical Empiricism]]. Since 2011 the IVC is also a subunit of the Faculty of Philosophy and Education at the [[University of Vienna]]. The Institute’s founder and scientific director is [[Friedrich Stadler]].

==Objectives==
&lt;blockquote&gt;Its goal is the documentation and continued development of the Vienna Circle's work in science and public education, areas which have been neglected until now, as well as the maintenance and application of logical-empircial, critical-rational and linguistic analytical thought and construction of a scientific philosophy and world view in conjunction with general socio-cultural trends. One of the Institute's main objectives is to democratize knowledge and science as a process of enlightenment, counteracting all forms of irrational, dogmatic or fundamentalist thought, in a societal context and taking into account the latest developments in international research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.univie.ac.at/ivc/e_institut/index.htm|title=Institute Vienna Circle|website=Univie.ac.at|accessdate=23 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[File:Grave of James Frederick Ferrier, St Cuthberts, Edinburgh.JPG|thumb|Grave of James Frederick Ferrier, [[St Cuthbert's Church, Edinburgh]].]]

'''James Frederick Ferrier''' (16 June 1808, [[Edinburgh]]&amp;nbsp;– 11 June 1864, [[St Andrews]]) was a Scottish [[metaphysics|metaphysical]] writer and philosopher. He introduced the word ''[[epistemology]]'' in philosophical English.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Oxford English Dictionary |date=2014 |publisher=Oxford University Press |edition=3rd |chapter=Epistemology}}. See also [[Epistemology#Etymology]].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education and early writings==
Ferrier was born at 15 Heriot Row&lt;ref&gt;Edinburgh Post Office Directory 1810/11&lt;/ref&gt; in Edinburgh, the son of John Ferrier, [[writer to the signet]]. He was educated at the [[Royal High School (Edinburgh)|Royal High School]], the [[University of Edinburgh]] and [[Magdalen College, Oxford]], and subsequently, his metaphysical tastes having been fostered by his intimate friend, [[Sir William Hamilton, 9th Baronet|Sir William Hamilton]], spent some time at [[university of Heidelberg|Heidelberg]] studying [[German philosophy]].

In 1842 he was appointed professor of [[civil history]] at Edinburgh University, and in 1845 professor of [[moral philosophy]] and [[political economy]] at the [[University of St Andrews]]. He was twice an unsuccessful candidate for chairs in Edinburgh, for that of [[moral philosophy]] on Wilson's resignation in 1852, and for that of [[logic]] and metaphysics in 1856, after Hamilton's death. He remained at St Andrews till his death. He married his cousin, Margaret Anne, daughter of John Wilson. He had five children, one of whom became the wife of [[Alex Grant (poet)|Sir Alexander Grant]].

==Early career==
Ferrier's first contribution to metaphysics was a series of articles in ''[[Blackwood's Magazine]]'' (1838–1839), entitled ''An Introduction to the Philosophy of Consciousness''. In these he condemns previous philosophers for ignoring in their psychological investigations the fact of [[consciousness]], which is the distinctive feature of man, and confining their observation to the so-called states of the mind. Consciousness comes into manifestation only when the man has used the word with full knowledge of what it means. This notion he must originate within himself. Consciousness cannot spring from the states which are its object, for it is in [[wikt:antagonism|antagonism]] to them. It originates in the will, which in the act of consciousness puts the "I" in the place of our sensations. [[Morality]], [[conscience]], and [[Moral responsibility|responsibility]] are necessary results of consciousness.

These articles were succeeded by a number of others, of which the most important were ''The Crisis of Modern Speculation'' (1841), ''Berkeley and Idealism'' (1842), and an important examination of Hamilton's edition of [[Thomas Reid|Reid]] (1847), which contains a vigorous attack on the philosophy of [[common sense]]. The perception of matter is pronounced to be the ''[[ne plus ultra]]'' of thought, and Reid, for presuming to analyse it, is declared to be a [[representationist]] in fact, although he professed to be an [[intuitionist]]. A distinction is made between the perception of matter and our apprehension of the perception of matter. [[Psychology]] vainly tries to analyse the former. [[Metaphysics]] shows the latter alone to be analysable, and separates the subjective element, our apprehension, from the objective element, the perception of matter; not matter per se, but the perception of matter is the existence independent of the individuals thought. It cannot, however, be independent of thought. It must belong to some mind, and is therefore the property of the [[Divine Mind]]. There, he thinks, is an indestructible foundation for the a priori argument for the [[existence of God]].

==Later writings==
Ferrier's matured philosophical doctrines find expression in the ''Institutes of Metaphysic the Theory of Knowing and Being'' (1854), in which he claims to have met the twofold obligation resting on every system of philosophy, that it should be reasoned and true. His method is that of [[Baruch Spinoza|Spinoza]], strict demonstration, or at least an attempt at it. All the errors of natural thinking and psychology must fall under one or other of three topics: [[Knowledge|Knowing and the Known]], [[Ignorance]], and [[Being]]. These are all-comprehensive, and are therefore the departments into which philosophy is divided, for the sole end of philosophy is to correct the inadvertencies of ordinary thinking.

Self-evident truths concerning knowing and the known are discussed in the ''Institutes of Metaphysic'' (Ferrier is thought to have coined the term [[epistemology]] in this work, p.&amp;nbsp;46). It explains that the fact that any intelligence, in addition to knowing whatever it knows, must as the ground or condition of its knowledge have some [[self-awareness|cognizance of itself]] as the basis of the whole philosophical system. In addition, the only possible kind of knowable is one which is both known of an object and known by a subject (Object + Subject, or Thing + Intelligence). This leads to the conclusion that the only independent [[universe]] which any mind can think of is the universe in synthesis with some other mind or ego.

The leading contradiction which is corrected in the ''Agnoiology or Theory of Ignorance'' claims that there can be an ignorance of that of which there can be no knowledge. It is corrected by appealing to the fact that Ignorance is a defect, and argues that there is no defect in not knowing what cannot be known by any intelligence (for example, that two and two make five), and therefore there can be an ignorance only of that of which there can be a knowledge, that is, of some-object-plus-some-subject. Therefore, the knowable alone is the ignorable. Ferrier lays special claim to originality for this division of the Institutes.

''The Ontology or Theory of Being'' forms a discussion of the origin of knowledge, in which Ferrier traces all the perplexities and errors of philosophers to the assumption of the absolute existence of matter. The conclusion arrived at is that the only true real and independent existences are minds-together-with-that-which-they-apprehend, and that the one strictly necessary absolute existence is a supreme and infinite and everlasting mind in synthesis with all things.

[[Encyclopædia Britannica Eleventh Edition|1911 ''Encyclopædia Britannica'']] adjudges Ferrier's works as remarkable for their unusual charm and simplicity of style, qualities which are especially noticeable in the ''Lectures on Greek Philosophy'', one of the best introductions on the subject in the English language.

A complete edition of his philosophical writings was published in 1875, with a memoir by [[Edmund Law Lushington]]. See also the monograph by [[Elizabeth Sanderson Haldane]] in the ''Famous Scots Series'' (link below).

==Family==
His mother was a sister of [[John Wilson (Scottish writer)|John Wilson]] (pseudonym Christopher North), making Wilson his uncle. His younger brother was named John wilson Ferrier.

James is buried with his family in [[St Cuthbert's Church, Edinburgh|St. Cuthberts Churchyard]] in [[Edinburgh]] just to the north-east of the church. Ferrier was also the great great grandfather of [[Ludovic Kennedy]] .

He was cousin to [[Susan Ferrier]] and is buried with her.

{{Jews and Judaism sidebar}}
'''Jewish Kalam''' was an early medieval style of [[Jewish philosophy#Jewish scholarship after destruction of Second Temple|Jewish philosophy]] that evolved in response to the [[Kalam|Islamic Kalam]], which in turn was a reaction against [[Aristotelianism|Aristotelian philosophy]].

The term "Jewish Kalam" is used by modern historians, but is not a term by which Jewish thinkers designated themselves. In all likelihood, they were simply known by the Arabic term ''Mutakallimūn'' ("Kalamists"), as they are referred to by [[Maimonides]] and other Jewish writers.

The best known practitioner of Jewish Kalam was [[Saadia Gaon]], and Jewish Kalam represented the philosophical battlefield upon which Saadia attacked the proponents of [[Karaite Judaism]]. Maimonides in his ''[[The Guide for the Perplexed]]'' frequently references and disputes positions of Kalam, both Jewish and Muslim, and in general conveys an opinion of Kalam that is highly uncomplimentary. [[Judah Halevi]] also makes reference to Jewish followers of the Kalam, but mentions only Karaite Jews.{{sfn|Wolfson|1967}}

==Basic principles of Jewish Kalam==
Some of the basic principles of the Jewish Kalam are as follow .{{sfn|Stroumsa|2003}} See also Maimonides's characterization of the principles below.
* Observation of the natural world reveals the existence of a Creator
* The world/universe must have been created ''[[ex nihilo]]'' rather than from preexisting matter
* The Creator is absolutely different from anything in the created world
* The Creator is a perfect unity, with no division
* Human moral criteria '''can''' be applied to God. To say God is "wise" or God is "good" is to apply those terms ''meaningfully'', and their meaning is related to the mundane meaning of those terms (cf. Maimonides)

==Maimonides' characterization==
Maimonides refers repeatedly to the ''Mutakallimūn'' (Kalam philosophers) in ''The Guide for the Perplexed ''. Some examples of his characterization of Kalamic thought can be found at the end of Book I (Chapters 73–76).&lt;ref&gt;see also {{Harv|Wolfson|1967}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quotation|As for that scanty bit of argument (kalam) regarding the notion of the unity of God and regarding what depends on this notion, which you will find in the writings of some [[Gaonim]] and in those of the Qaraites, the subject matter of this argument was taken over by them from the Mutakallimūn of [[Islam]] and that this bit is very scanty indeed if compared to what Islam has compiled on this subject. Also it has so happened that Islam first began to take this road owing to a certain sect, namely, the [[Muʿtazila]], from whom our co-religionists took over certain things walking upon the road the Muʿtazila had taken. After a certain time another sect arose in Islam, namely, the [[Ashʿari]]yya, among whom other opinions arose. You will not find any of these latter opinions among our co-religionists. This was not because they preferred the first opinion to the second, but because it so happened that they had taken over and adopted the first opinion and considered it a matter proven by demonstration|Maimonides|{{Harv|Pines|1963}}}}

Maimonides continues in that section to provide a history of Kalamic thought, its sources and subsequent development, and then proceeds to condemn a certain laxity of thought to be found in this philosophical school. In particular, Maimonides takes strong issue with the Kalamic proof of God's existence and unity from the Creation of the World in time. While Maimonides himself ''does'' regard the world as having been created ''ex nihilo'' (rather than being eternally existing, as [[Aristotle]] would have it; see GP, Book II Chapter 25, for example), Maimonides also considers this proposition as being far from obvious, and in all likelihood not susceptible to proof. He thus regards the Kalamic approach as starting from a position of ''convenience'' rather than from an irrefutable premise, and their methodology as being entirely tainted by their eagerness to produce certain results which support their prior beliefs.

Additionally he considers their premises to "run counter to the nature of existence that is perceived." He writes that "every one of their premises, with few exceptions, is contradicted by what is perceived of the nature of that which exists, so that doubts come up with regard to them." However, it can be noted below, that in many cases the Kalamists were indeed more prescient than Maimonides himself in their beliefs regarding the discrete nature of matter, existence of vacuum, and other physical characteristics of the natural world.

===Principles of Kalam according to Maimonides===
{{see also|Atomism}}
In Book I Chapter 73, Maimonides presents the 12 premises of the Mutakallimūn, and disputes most of them. The premises are, in brief, as follow:

# Existence of atoms: The world is composed of small particles which are not divisible, and which have no identifying essential properties (only accidents).
# Existence of vacuum: There exist certain spaces which are devoid of all substance and material.
# Time is discrete: Time is made up of fundamental ''instants'' which are not themselves subject to further division.
# Every body is subject to accidents: Any body must have either an accident (non-essential feature) or its opposite. A body cannot be without accidents.
# These accidents exist in the atom.
# An atom has one-instant duration: An atom does not persist (its accidents do not persist) more than one moment of time. God must repeatedly create these accidents at each time instant, or they permanently go out of existence.
# Accidents in bodies also do not persist and must be recreated. This and the previous principle constitute a denial of [[causality]].
# Only substance and accident exist: Bodies differ only in regard to their accidents.
# Accidents subsist in a common substratum: An accident cannot subsist in another accident.
# Any state of affairs which can be imagined is admissible in intellectual argument.
# All kinds of infinity are impossible.
# The senses may be in error: The senses should not be trusted in matters of demonstration.

Not all of these principles were elements of the Jewish Kalam as practiced by particular thinkers. For example, ''atomism'' was a principle embraced by earlier Karaite Jews but not by the Geonim or later Karaites. Wolfson considers it doubtful whether any Jewish thinkers ever embraced the denial of causality.

===Arguments of Kalam according to Maimonides===
In Book I Chapter 74, Maimonides reproduces the seven methods by which the Mutakallimūn demonstrate that the world is created in time. In Chapter 75, Maimonides reproduces the five methods by which the Mutakallimūn demonstrate the unity of God. In Chapter 76, Maimonides reproduces the three methods by which the Mutakallimūn demonstrate the incorporeality of God. Needless to say, Maimonides finds most of these methods to be philosophically inadequate and naïve.

==Jewish Kalam personalities==
Among the personalities associated with the Jewish Kalam are the following, many of whom were Karaites:

===Rabbinites===
* Saadia Gaon
* [[Hai Gaon]]
* [[David ibn Merwan al-Mukkamas]]
* [[Samuel ben Hofni]]

:Note: Jewish Kalam is adopted by the Rabbinite Academies of [[Kairouan]], [[Fustat]], [[Lucena, Córdoba|Lucena]], [[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]] and [[Córdoba, Spain|Córdoba]] as the Babylonian Jewish Academies in [[Sura Academy|Sura]], [[Pumbedita]], [[Basra]] and [[Baghdad]] closed and transferred their intellectual and religious heritage to [[al-Andalus]].

===Karaites===
* [[Jacob Qirqisani]]
* [[Yefet ben Ali]]
* [[Jeshua ben Judah]]
* [[Daniel al-Kumisi]]
* [[Joseph ben Abraham]]
* [[Jeshua ben Judah]]
* [[Judah Hadassi]]

Because the composition of written works was yet uncommon at the time that the Jewish Kalam flourished, there are few surviving books from this era.{{sfn|Wolfson|1967}} Instead, what we have are selected quotes and paraphrases such as found in Maimonides and Saadia, but mostly we have what Wolfson calls "mere names," individuals who are identified as prominent Kalamic thinkers but who left no evidence of their work or lives. Wolfson provides a list of some of these "mere names." He also suggests that ''all'' the Jewish thinkers of this period were likely referred to as Mutakallimūn, as suggested by references from [[Moses ibn Ezra]] and others.

==Legacy of the Kalam==
Jewish Kalamic thought had influences on many later Jewish philosophers, including Judah Halevi, [[Joseph ibn Tzaddik]], [[Bahya ibn Paquda]], and Maimonides, who criticized it vigorously. Many of the works of the Jewish Kalamists were not translated from Arabic into [[Mishnaic Hebrew]], and so their influence greatly diminished as the Golden Age of Arabic-language Jewish scholarship drew to a close.{{sfn|Stroumsa|2003}}

'''Johannes Althusius''' (c. 1563 – August 12, 1638)&lt;ref name = JohanEB&gt;{{Citation | title = Encyclopædia Britannica | contribution-url = http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9005931/Johannes-Althusius | contribution = Johannes Althusius}}.&lt;/ref&gt; was a German jurist and [[Calvinist]] [[political philosopher]].

He is best known for his 1603 work, ''"Politica Methodice Digesta, Atque Exemplis Sacris et Profanis Illustrata"''.{{Efn | Latin for "Politics Methodically Digested, Illustrated with [[Sacred and Profane]] Examples".}} revised editions were published in 1610 and 1614.  The ideas expressed therein relate to the early development of federalism in the 16th and 17th centuries and the construction of [[subsidiarity]].

==Biography==
Althusius was born around 1563, to a family of modest means in [[Diedenshausen]], County Sayn-Wittgenstein ([[Siegen-Wittgenstein]]),&lt;ref name=JohanEB/&gt; a Calvinist County in what is now the state of [[North Rhine Westphalia]] but was then the seat of an independent ''Grafschaft'' or County.  Under the patronage of a local count, he attended the Gymnasium Philippinum in [[Marburg]] from 1577 and began his studies in 1581, concentrating in law and philosophy.  He first studied Aristotle in [[Cologne]], then he studied later law around 1585/86 under [[Denis Godefroy]] at [[Basel]].&lt;ref name="On Law and Power"&gt;Johannes Althusius, ''[http://www.clpress.com/publications/law-and-power On Law and Power]''. CLP Academic, 2013, p.xx.&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1586, Althusius received his doctorate in civil and canon law from the [[University of Basel]]. While studying at Basel, Althusius lived with [[Johann Jakob Grynaeus|Johannes Grynaeus]] for a period of time, with whom he studied theology.&lt;ref name="On Law and Power"/&gt;

In 1586, after completing his studies, Althusius became the first professor of law at the Protestant-Calvinist [[Herborn Academy]] of Nassau County.&lt;ref name="On Law and Power"/&gt; From 1592 to 1596, he taught at the Calvinist Academy in Burgsteinfurt/Westphalia, and was afterward appointed president of the Nassau College in [[Siegen]] (removed in this town from 1596 to 1600) in 1599/1600 and in Herborn in 1602,&lt;ref name = JohanEB /&gt; also beginning his political career by serving as a member of the [[Nassau, Germany|Nassau]] (Germany) county council.  For the next several years, he became involved in various colleges throughout the area, variously serving as their president and lecturing on law and philosophy, and in 1603, he was elected to be a municipal trustee of the city of [[Emden]], in [[East Frisia]], where he ultimately made his fame. He became a city [[Syndic]] in 1604, which placed him at the helm of Emden's governance until his death.

In 1617, Althusius published his principal judicial work, ''Dicaeologicae''.  In this work, he categorized laws into types main types: natural laws and positive laws, and argued that natural law is "the will of God for men."&lt;ref&gt;Johannes Althusius, ''[http://www.clpress.com/publications/law-and-power On Law and Power]''. CLP Academic, 2013, pp.lvi.&lt;/ref&gt; Althusius contended that terms such as "common law" and "moral law" were other names for natural law.  In order to know the true dictates of natural law, he argued, we must carefully study Scripture and tradition, as well as revelation and reason.&lt;ref&gt;Johannes Althusius, ''[http://www.clpress.com/publications/law-and-power On Law and Power]''. CLP Academic, 2013, p.lviii.&lt;/ref&gt;

Johannes Althusius died on August 12, 1638, in Emden.&lt;ref name=JohanEB /&gt;

After his death, Althusius remained a controversial thinker.  His ''Politica'' was attacked by [[Henning Arnisaeus]] and [[Hugo Grotius]] during the seventeenth century for its defense of local autonomies against the rise of territorial absolutism and proponents of the modern unitary nation state.&lt;ref&gt;Johannes Althusius, ''[http://www.clpress.com/publications/law-and-power On Law and Power]''. CLP Academic, 2013, p.xxiii.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
{{unreferenced section|date=August 2017}}
By the time Althusius began his formal studies in 1581, the [[Dutch Revolt]] against Spain had already come to a head, and it was not to be settled until Dutch independence was recognized in 1609.  Because the nature of the conflict was largely religious – Calvinist states rebelling against their Catholic overlords – it was of especial interest to Calvinist political thinkers such as Althusius.

In the late sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries, Emden in East Frisia (now Germany) was at the crossroads of political and religious activity in the region.  A prosperous seaport situated between the Netherlands and the [[Holy Roman Empire]], with convenient maritime access to England, Emden was a prominent city in the politics and policy of all three nations, and was thus able to retain a significant amount of political freedom.  It was located within the overlapping territories of the [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]] [[Habsburg]] emperor and a [[Lutheran]] provincial lord, but its population was mainly Calvinist, and the city had a strong Calvinist spirit.  Emden also played host to two Protestant synods, first in 1571 and again in 1610, and was widely regarded as the "Geneva of the North" or the "alma mater" of the [[Dutch Reformed Church]].  These attributes made the city the ideal place for Althusius to propose his particular brand of political philosophy; Emden's theological and political prominence coupled with its yen for religious and civic independence made the Althusian political theory both topical and popular.

==Works==
* ''Civilis conversationis libri duo'', 1601
* ''Politica'', the first edition of which was completed in 1603, is considered not only the most fully developed scheme of Calvinist political theory, but also the only systematic justification of the Dutch Revolt. Althusius took from thinkers in various fields, including [[Aristotle]], [[John Calvin|Calvin]], [[Jean Bodin|Bodin]], [[Machiavelli]], [[Grotius]], and [[Peter Ramus]]; ''Politica'' cited close to 200 books in all; the first edition of ''Politica'' was received with wide acclaim in Emden and in the Netherlands beyond. It may have been influential on American via [[Alexander Henderson (theologian)|Alexander Henderson]].
* ''Dicaeologica libri tres, totum et universum Jus'', Frankfurt, 1618.  Sections of this work have been recently translated into English and published by Christian's Library Press as ''On Law and Power'' (2013).

==Family==
He was married in 1596 in Siegen to Margarethe Neurath (born 1574), with whom he had at least six children.

==Biography==
Born in [[Salisbury]], [[Wiltshire]], Keynes was the son of Dr John Keynes (1805–1878) and his wife Anna Maynard Neville (1821–1907).  He was educated at [[Amersham Hall |Amersham Hall School]], [[University College London]] and [[Pembroke College, Cambridge|Pembroke College]], [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]], where he became a fellow in 1876.&lt;ref&gt;{{acad|id=KNS872JN|name=Keynes, John Neville}}&lt;/ref&gt; He held a lectureship in [[Faculty of Philosophy, University of Cambridge|Moral Sciences]] from 1883 to 1911.  He was elected as [[Registrary]] in 1910, and held that office until 1925.

He divided [[economics]] into "positive economy" (the study of what is, and the way the economy works), "normative economy" (the study of what should be), and the "art of economics" ([[applied economics]]). The art of economics relates the lessons learned in positive economics to the normative goals determined in normative economics. He tried to synthesise [[deductive reasoning|deductive]] and [[inductive reasoning]] as a solution to the "[[Methodenstreit]]".  His main works were:
* [https://archive.org/details/studiesandexerc01keyngoog ''Studies and Exercises in Formal Logic''] (1884)
* ''[http://socserv.mcmaster.ca/econ/ugcm/3ll3/keynesjn/Scope.pdf The Scope and Method of Political Economy]'' (1891)

In 1882 he married [[Florence Ada Brown]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Keynes, John Neville |journal=Who's Who,|year=1907|volume= 59|pages=980–981 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yEcuAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA981}}&lt;/ref&gt; who was later a Mayor of Cambridge.  They had two sons and a daughter:

* [[John Maynard Keynes]] (1883–1946), the economist.
* [[Geoffrey Keynes]] (1887–1982), a surgeon.
* Margaret Neville Keynes (1890–1974), who married [[Archibald Hill]] (winner of the 1922 Nobel Prize for Physiology) in 1913.

He outlived his elder son by three years; he died in [[Cambridge]], aged 97.

'''John of St. Thomas,''' born '''João Poinsot''' ([[Help:IPA|\ʒwau̇ⁿ\]]; 9 June 1589 – 17 June 1644) was a [[Kingdom of Portugal|Portuguese]] [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] friar and [[Thomism|Thomist]] [[theology|theologian]]-[[philosophy|philosopher]].

==Biography==
Of noble parentage, he was sent early to the [[University of Coimbra]], displayed talents of the first order, completed his humanities and philosophy, and obtained the degree of Master of Arts. He then entered the [[Old University of Louvain|University of Louvain]]. Here, too, he showed remarkable ability, and won the title of Bachelor of Theology at an early age. He joined the Dominicans at Madrid in 1612 or 1613, taking the name of John of St. Thomas, by which he is known to history. As professor of philosophy and theology in a monastery at Alcalá, he soon took rank among the most learned men of the time, and was placed successively (1630 and 1640) in charge of the two principal chairs of theology in the university of that city. His renown drew the largest number of scholars that had ever attended its theological faculties.

No man enjoyed a greater reputation in Spain, or was more frequently consulted on points of doctrine and ecclesiastical matters. His theological and philosophical writings, which have gone through many editions, are among the best expositions of [[Thomas Aquinas]]'s doctrine, of which he is acknowledged to be one of the foremost interpreters. Though he took an active part in the scholastic discussions of his times, his courtesy was such that he is said never to have hurt an opponent's feelings. So faithful was he to the traditions of his order and the principles of the Angelic Doctor that in his last illness he could declare that, in all the thirty years he had devoted to teaching and writing, he had not taught or written anything contrary to St. Thomas. His humility and his devotion to education caused him to refuse many dignities offered him by the Church and his order. In 1643 Philip IV offered him the office of royal confessor, a position which only religious obedience could induce him to accept. His writings comprise: ''Cursus philosophicus Thomisticus'' (9 vols.); ''Cursus Theologici'' (9 vols.), which is a commentary on the ''Summa Theologica'' of St. Thomas; ''Tractatus de Approbatione, Auctoritate, et Puritate Doctrinae D. Thomae Aquinatis''; ''A Compendium of Christian Doctrine'' (in Spanish); and ''A Treatise on a Happy Death'' (in Spanish), written at the command of Philip IV.&lt;ref&gt;Quétif and Echard, Scriptores Ord. Praed., II (Paris, 1721), 538; Touron, Hommes illustres de l'ordre de St. Dominique, V (Paris, 1749), 248; Hurter, Nomenclator, I (2nd ed., Innsbruck, 1892), 375; Année Dominicaine, II June, 358-365.&lt;/ref&gt;  He died at [[Fraga]], [[Spain]].&lt;ref&gt;{{CathEncy|wstitle=John of St. Thomas}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==JDWC® Redefining Cotillion for the 21st Century==
Over the last 65 years Jon D. Williams Cotillions® has redefined the term cotillion by rendering the traditional 'formal ball' to be applicable in the 21st century.

Williams III).

Thus began the illustrious career of [[Jon and Vivian Williams]] as the number one national instructional team of [[Arthur Murray]]. Soon the perfect dance partners became partners in life and were married. After World War II, Jon was contacted by [[Fred Astaire]] and offered the position of setting up Fred Astaire Studios across the country.

Williams III]], son of the founder and president of the organization, now leading the next generation.

'''Jorge Aníbal Romero Brest''' (October 2, 1905 &amp;ndash; February 12, 1989) was an influential [[art critic]] in Argentina, who helped popularize [[avant-garde art]] in his country.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pensamientonacional.com.ar/contenedor.php?idpg=efemeridesdeoctubre.html Pensamiento Nacional: Efemérides de Octubre] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110523093954/http://www.pensamientonacional.com.ar/contenedor.php?idpg=efemeridesdeoctubre.html |date=2011-05-23 }} {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life and work==
Born in [[Buenos Aires]] in 1905, Romero Brest enjoyed multiple interests in his youth, and excelled in a variety of sports. His father, Enrique Romero Brest, established the National Institute of Physical Education.  Jorge Brest began writing for his father's [[sports magazine]], ''Revista de Educación Física''. His research for these articles familiarized him with [[André Dunoyer de Segonzac]]'s illustrations on the subject, and he developed an intellectual interest in art. He enrolled at the [[University of Buenos Aires]] in 1926, earned a [[Law degree]] in 1933, and married Amelia Rossi.&lt;ref name=brest&gt;[http://www.archivoromerobrest.com.ar/indice/autobiografia.htm Archivo Romero Brest: Autobiografía] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706080706/http://www.archivoromerobrest.com.ar/indice/autobiografia.htm |date=2011-07-06 }} {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His interest in [[art theory]] as a hobby resulted in his first book, ''El problema del arte y del artista contemporáneos'' (''The Problems of Contemporary Art and Artists''), in 1937. Brest was a talented speaker, and first gained renown as an art critic and commentator in a 1943 conference entitled "The element of rhythm in film and sports."  He wrote columns on the philosophy of sport for the socialist newspaper ''La Vanguardia'' at the invitation of its editor, [[Mario Bravo]], in 1939 and 1940.&lt;ref name=plana&gt;[http://www.magicasruinas.com.ar/revdesto029.htm ''Revista Primera Plana'' (April 1967): Jorge Romero Brest.] {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Romero Brest became known as a confrontational art critic, and was initially disdainful of [[Surrealism (art)|Surrealism]] in art, writing highly critical reviews of an exhibit by Orion Group painter [[Luis Barragán (painter)|Luis Barragán]] and others, recommending they first "learn to paint".  He then published a biography of the renowned Argentine [[Realism (art)|Realist]] painter [[Prilidiano Pueyrredón]], in 1942, and a study of [[Michelangelo]]'s famed ''[[David (Michelangelo)|David]]'', in 1943.  He published the first two volumes of his ''History of Art'' in 1945, publishing the third and fourth in 1946 and 1958, respectively.  This latter work was subsequently used as a textbook in several Latin American universities.&lt;ref name=plana/&gt;

The affiliation of many in the arts with the [[Socialist Party of Argentina|Socialist Party]] led to harassment by government officials, particularly by the populist President [[Juan Perón]]. In 1947, Perón ordered the Altamira Art Academy dissolved, leaving painters [[Emilio Pettoruti]] and [[Raúl Soldi]], sculptor [[Lucio Fontana]], and Romero Brest, who served as the academy's [[art history]] professor, among others, without a teaching post.  Brest continued an active schedule of conferences and workshops, and founded the arts review journal ''Ver y Estimar'' (''Look and Consider'').  He taught a course in Aesthetics and Art History at the Fray Mocho bookstore, and drew large numbers of students.  His 1952 text, ''La pintura europea contemporánea'' (''Contemporary Painting in Europe''), was a success, and a series of international seminars followed.&lt;ref name=plana/&gt;

The [[Revolución Libertadora|military dictatorship]] that overthrew Perón in 1955 named Brest director of the [[Museo Nacional de Bellas Artes (Buenos Aires)|National Museum of Fine Arts]]. Both the museum and its collections were modernized and expanded during his tenure as director.  A temporary exhibits pavilion was opened in 1961, and the museum acquired a large volume of [[modern art]] though its collaboration with the [[Torcuato di Tella Institute]], a leading promoter of local [[avant-garde art]]ists.&lt;ref name=dt&gt;[http://html.rincondelvago.com/instituto-di-tella.html Instituto Di Tella: Promoción del arte. Experimentación audiovisual. Investigación y financiación artística] {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the artists whose work Brest introduced to the museum were [[Raúl Soldi]], Héctor Basaldúa, Guillermo Butler, [[Lino Enea Spilimbergo]], [[Emilio Pettoruti]], and [[Ramón Gómez Cornet]], as well as painters from the same Orion Group whose work he lampooned in the 1940s.  He organized the museum's first [[Abstract Art]] exposition in 1960, showing works by Sarah Grilo, [[José Antonio Fernández Muro]], [[Octavio Ocampo]], [[Kazuya Sakai]], and  [[Clorindo Testa]], and its first exhibit of [[Neo-figurative]] art in 1963, with works by [[Jorge de la Vega]], [[Luis Felipe Noé]], [[Ernesto Deira]], and [[Rómulo Macció]], known among local art circles as the "four horsemen of the apocalypse".&lt;ref&gt;''Jorge Romero Brest. La cultura como provocación.'' Buenos Aires: Ediciones de autor, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; 
  
Brest resigned from his post at the National Fine Arts Museum in 1963, and was named director of the Center for Visual Arts at the Torcuato di Tella Institute. The institute then became the leading Argentine center for [[pop art]], [[experimental theatre]], and [[conceptual art]], drawing artists such as [[León Ferrari]], [[Nacha Guevara]], [[Gyula Kosice]], [[Nicolás García Uriburu]], and [[Antonio Seguí]].  Brest also promoted the center's famed [[Happening]]s, notably those of [[Marta Minujín]], whose interactive displays and mazes helped make the institute Buenos Aires' ''mazana loca'' (''city block of madness'').&lt;ref name=dt/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pagina12.com.ar/1998/suple/radar/mayo/98-05-24/nota2_a.htm ''Página/12'' (5/24/1998)] {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The director's often challenging style did not endear him to all whose work bore his scrutiny, and some became his enemies over the years.  These conflicts were satirized by a Happening staged by Federico Manuel Peralta, in which a [[tug-of-war]] was arranged on [[Florida Street]] with many of the institute's artists on one end, and the unflappable Brest on the other.&lt;ref name=p12&gt;[http://www.pagina12.com.ar/diario/suplementos/libros/14-2006-07-23.html ''Página/12'': El gran Romero Brest]{{dead link|date=April 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1966 [[Revolución Argentina|military coup]] limited [[freedom of expression]] at the institute and elsewhere.  Facing conditions such as this, numerous avant-garde artists (and others, [[Noche de los Bastones Largos|particularly in academia]]) left Argentina, many never to return.&lt;ref name=crawley&gt;Crawley, Eduardo. ''A House Divided: Argentina 1880–1980''. St. Martin's Press, 1985.&lt;/ref&gt;  Brest's tenure ended in 1969, and the institute closed shortly afterward.  He published ''Ensayo sobre la contemplación artística'' (''Essay on Artistic Contemplation''), and explained that his promotion of avant-garde art at the center had been based on creative input from the artists, and "a certain objective quality, not just a belated imitation of European movements."&lt;ref name=plana/&gt;

He also served as a jurist in numerous international [[biennale]]s, notably for a number of [[Venice Biennale]]s and for [[Documenta]] IV ([[Kassel]], [[Germany]]), in 1968.  He retired upon the closure of the Center for Visual Arts, though his byline appeared in occasional reviews for art magazines in Argentina and [[Colombia]].&lt;ref name=brest/&gt;

Brest lived during this period in a distinctive blue house in suburban [[City Bell]] designed for him by one of the artists made famous at the Di Tella Institute: Edgardo Giménez. The residence was peculiar also for Brest's bed, which was suspended five feet (1.5 m) off the ground, and could only be accessed by a ladder.&lt;ref name=p12/&gt;

Brest was frank when discussing the [[neurosis]], which had earned him notoriety among colleagues,&lt;ref name=brest/&gt; and admitted to having benefited as much from [[psychotherapy]] as he did from his second wife, Marta Bontempi, who chastised his irascible moments by ordering him to "be quiet, Enrique!" (in reference to Brest's disciplinarian father).&lt;ref name=plana/&gt;

He later relocated to a [[Barrio Norte, Buenos Aires|northside]] Buenos Aires apartment, and died in 1989, at age 83.&lt;ref name=p12/&gt;

'''Jurij Moskvitin''' (Robert Jurij Moskvitin Hansen, January 6, 1938 – May 25, 2005) was a classical pianist, composer, philosopher, mathematician and boheme.
[[File:Jurij Blixen &amp; Stravinskij.jpg|frame|Jurij Moskvitin accompanying Karen Blixen at her meeting with [[Igor Stravinsky]] at the [[Copenhagen City Hall]]]]

Jurij Moskvitin grew up in Denmark; his mother a Russian aristocrat and his father was a Danish civil engineer. After [[World War II]] he studied at [[The Royal Danish Academy of Music]] in Copenhagen. He then obtained a master's degree in Philosophy at the [[University of Copenhagen]].

He was a friend of Isak Dinesen ([[Karen Blixen]]), [[Simon Spies]], [[Tao Nørager]] and Henrik Stangerup.

His works include:
*Essay on The Origin of Thought 1974 (philosophy)
*Det er spændende at tænke 1976 (philosophy)
*Music to the movie "Jorden Er Flad or The Earth is Flat" 1977 by Henrik Stangerup 
*Den store undren 1992 (philosophy)
*Simon Spies. Historien om et venskab 1984–1999 (biography)
*Den døve øgle 2001 (Self-Portraits) 
*Du må ikke sjuske med dit liv 2008 (biography; Henrik Stangerup)

He was one of the main characters in the documentary "En aften i november" the other being Ilja Bergh. He was also interviewed in the documentary "At skrive eller dø &amp; At forråde virkeligheden" about his relationship with Henrik Stangerup. He regularly appeared in the Danish TV-program "Smagsdommerne" until his death. He also appears in the radio documentary "Eliten fra Minefeltet" where he talks about his relationship to the pianist Klaus Heerfordt.

==Essay on the Origin of Thought 1974==
[[File:Jurij moskvitin portrait.jpg|thumb|right|Jurij Moskvitin in a thoughtful moment in 1996, "This is how I want to be remembered after my death."]]
In this book, Moskvitin records a collection of his theories on the beginnings of thought and language. In his view, the origin of language and thought lie in spontaneous and rare creative acts, often inspired in a human in a stressful and dangerous situation.

These thoughts are inspired by a period in which the author turned his attention "from 'what he thinks' to 'how he thinks'", a turn to introspection. Moskvitin describes how he came to observe "states of mind when consciousness is kept somewhere halfway between the waking state and dream." Moskvitin became aware of strange "sparks" and "smoke-like forms", which "upon close and intense observation became the elements of waking dreams, forming persons, landscapes, strange mathematical [[fractal]] forms." Moskvitin came to believe that the [[hypnagogic]] patterns he was observing were the actual `material' out of which the conscious mind `builds' its representation of the external world. Our inner world of dreams and visions comes before the outer one of sensory stimuli ([[Closed-eye hallucination]]).

For Moskvitin, this inner world of sequential impressions we observe as our experience. Aggregates of lower-level forms creates concepts and higher-level ideas. In his view, humans have a tendency to relate their experience to the already known, dealing with situations in the world with methods and ideas created prior. It is only when this tendency to the familiar is reversed, or the use of it is nullified, such as in a dangerous situation, does a creative act emerge. The totality of those prior ideas and concepts (the totality of [[memes]]) he labels the 'anthroposphere'. For Moskvitin, the origin and development of this anthroposphere is in the multi-thousand year accumulation of rare and fortunate creative acts by individuals put in demanding situations.

Analyzing the creative act itself, Moskvitin postulates the existence of a 'projection mechanism' in humans - a mechanism which combines a few sustained impressions into a new aggregate, an idea. Building on what is essentially the stream model of consciousness, the mechanism depends on memory to store sequentially occurring impressions and the combinatorial projecting mechanism which provides the creating actor with the "vision" of the new idea from the lower-level forms mentioned above.

Jurij speculates about schizophrenia as an inability to distinguish between lower-level, interior forms and the exterior. He further postulates that the act of creation might involve a temporary state of schizophrenia. There are also further explorations of the topics of mysticism, occultism, and mathematics.

==Det er spændende at tænke 1976 (It's Exciting to Think)==
This book was made by Moskvitin in an effort to kick start a child's imagination. It contains classical examples in philosophy and [[logic]] and features illustrations by Jakob Hoffmeyer. It was published by Sommer og Sørensen.

== Den store undren 1992 (The Great Wonder) ==
This book takes up the philosophical questions: What is time? who am I? What is real? Why does anything exist at all? and presents them for the adult reader while guiding the reader through the history of philosophy. The book was published by Lindhart og Ringhof in 1992. Shortly thereafter Moskvitin wrote a highly critical and devastating review of his book in the Danish newspaper [[Politiken]] under a pen name. The aim was to create debate and interest in the book, but Moskvitin's plan backfired and the result was a low sale.

==Simon Spies. Historien om et venskab 1984,1999 (Simon Spies. The Story of a Friendship)==
This book was published twice. Immediately after Spies's death April 16, 1984 Moskivitin began Writing the book which he managed to publish within the same year under the title "Simon Spies – en myte" (Simon Spies a myth). The book received a critical reception in that it painted an honest, but non-glamorous portrait of the Danish [[tycoon]]. The book concerns itself with the [[psychedelic era]] of Simon Spies's life during the late 60's in which Moskvitin and Spies were close friends. Years later Moskivitin decided to edit out some of the more obscene details while making the book more readable. This "final version" called "Historien om et venskab" was published in 1999 by Lindhardt og Ringhof.

==Den døve øgle 2001 (The Deaf Lizard)==
[[File:Jurij moskvitin portrait 2.jpg|thumb|right|Image from the same photo session in 1996 as above]]
Moskvitin wrote this self-portrait as the first of two books, the second of which was never published. It contains the story of Moskvitin's childhood and youth. Moskvitin notably describes how he became friends with [[Karen Blixen]], how he had his first sexual intercourse in Paris, his first great concert in [[Cairo]], and his mother's aristocratic friends. The book follows Moskvitin in his never ending search for women, drugs and spiritual insight. The book was published in 2001 by Lindhardt og Ringhof.

== Du må ikke sjuske med dit liv 2008 (Thou Shalt Not Waste Thy Life) ==

Shortly after the death of Henrik Stangerup in 1998, Jurij Moskvitin started writing Stangerup's biography. It was completed in the spring of 1999. It was due to be released later that year by the publisher Lindhardt &amp; Ringhof, though the latter canceled the publication in the last moment due to concerns about Henrik's posthumous reputation. Only after the journalist Poul Pilgaard, having heard about the manuscript while interviewing pianist Ilja Bergh, tracked down a person possessing a copy, was the book published by Pilgaard's own publishing house Bianco Luno. The publication date was August 29, 2008, three years after Jurij Moskvitin's death.

[[File:31337 h4x0r.jpg|thumb|A "31337 h4x0r" laptop sticker, along with a [[Kevin Mitnick]] sticker]]
'''Leet''' (or "'''1337'''"), also known as '''eleet''' or '''leetspeak''', is a system of modified spellings used primarily on the [[Internet]]. It often uses character replacements  in ways that play on the similarity of their [[glyph]]s via [[reflection (mathematics)|reflection]] or other resemblance. Additionally, it modifies certain words based on a system of suffixes and alternate meanings. There are many [[dialects]] or [[Variety (linguistics)|linguistic varieties]] in different [[online communities]].

The term "leet" is derived from the word ''[[elite]]'', used as an adjective to describe formidable prowess or accomplishment, especially in the fields of [[online game|online gaming]] and [[Hacker (hobbyist)|computer hacking]]. The leet lexicon includes spellings of the word as ''1337'' or ''l33t''.

==History==
Leet originated within [[bulletin board system]]s (BBS) in the 1980s,&lt;ref name=mitchell&gt;Mitchell.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=bbc&gt;An Explanation of l33t Speak.&lt;/ref&gt; where having "elite" status on a BBS allowed a user access to file folders, games, and special chat rooms.  The [[Cult of the Dead Cow]] hacker collective has been credited with the original coining of the term, in their text-files of that era.&lt;ref&gt;Mello, John P.(2015) "[http://www.ecommercetimes.com/story/Google-Expands-Bug-Bounty-Program-81668.html] Google Expands Bug Bounty Program" February 2, 2015. ''E-Commerce Times''&lt;/ref&gt;  One theory is that it was developed to defeat text filters created by BBS or [[Internet Relay Chat]] [[system operators]] for message boards to discourage the discussion of forbidden topics, like [[Software cracking|cracking]] and [[Hacker (computer security)|hacking]].&lt;ref name=mitchell/&gt; Creative misspellings and ASCII-art-derived words were also a way to attempt to indicate one was knowledgeable about the culture of computer users. 

Once the reserve of [[Hacker (computer security)|hackers]], crackers, and [[script kiddie]]s, leet has since entered the mainstream.&lt;ref name=mitchell/&gt; It is now also used to mock [[newbie|newbies]], also known colloquially as noobs, or newcomers, on web sites, or in gaming communities.&lt;ref name=rome&gt;Rome.&lt;/ref&gt; Some consider [[emoticon]]s and [[ASCII art]], like smiley faces, to be leet, while others maintain that leet consists of only symbolic word encryption. More obscure forms of leet, involving the use of symbol combinations and almost no letters or numbers, continue to be used for its original purpose of encrypted communication. It is also sometimes used as a script language. Variants of leet have been used for censorship purposes for many years; for instance "@$$" (ass) and "$#!+" (shit) are frequently seen to make a word appear censored to the untrained eye but obvious to a person familiar with leet.

Leet symbols, especially the number 1337, are [[Internet meme]]s that have spilled over into popular culture. Signs that show the numbers "1337" are popular motifs for pictures and shared widely across the Internet.

==Orthography==

One of the hallmarks of leet is its unique approach to [[orthography]], using substitutions of other characters, letters or otherwise, to represent a letter or letters in a word.&lt;ref name=sterling&gt;Sterling, 70.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="goss 80"&gt;Blashki &amp; Nichol, 80.&lt;/ref&gt; For more casual use of leet, the primary strategy is to use [[homoglyph]]s, symbols that closely resemble (to varying degrees) the letters for which they stand. The choice of symbol is not fixed—anything that the reader can make sense of is valid. However, this practice is not extensively used in regular leet; more often it is seen in situations where the [[argot]] (i.e., secret language) characteristics of the system are required, either to exclude newbies or outsiders in general, i.e., anything that the ''average'' reader ''cannot'' make sense of is valid; a valid reader should himself try to make sense, if deserving of the underlying message. Another use for Leet orthographic substitutions is the creation of paraphrased passwords.&lt;ref name=mitchell/&gt; Limitations imposed by websites on password length (usually no more than 36) and the characters permitted (usually alphanumeric and underscore){{citation needed|date=October 2017}} require less extensive forms of Leet when used in this application.

Some examples of leet include ''[[B1ff]]'' and ''[[Newbie|n00b]]'', a term for the stereotypical [[newbie]]; the l33t programming language; and the web-comic ''[[Megatokyo]]'', which contains characters who speak leet.

==Morphology==

Text rendered in leet is often characterized by distinctive, recurring forms.

;''-xor'' suffix
:The meaning of this suffix is parallel with the English ''-er'' and ''-r'' suffixes (seen in ''hacker'' and ''lesser''),&lt;ref name=bbc/&gt; in that it derives [[agent noun]]s from a verb [[stem (linguistics)|stem]]. It is realized in two different forms: ''-xor'' and ''-zor'', {{IPAc-en|-|s|ɔːr}} and {{IPAc-en|-|z|ɔːr}}, respectively. For example, the first may be seen in the word ''hax(x)or'' (''H4x0r'' in leet) {{IPAc-en|ˈ|h|æ|k|s|ɔːr}} and the second in ''[[pwn]]zor'' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|oʊ|n|z|ɔːr}}. Additionally, this [[nominalization]] may also be [[inflection|inflected]] with all of the suffixes of regular [[English verbs]]. The letter 'o' is often replaced with the numeral 0.

;''-age'' suffix
:Derivation of a noun from a verb stem is possible by attaching ''-age'' to the base form of any verb. Attested derivations are ''pwnage'', ''skillage'',  and ''speakage''. However, leet provides exceptions; the word ''leetage'' is acceptable, referring to actively being ''leet''.&lt;ref name="goss 79"&gt;Blashki &amp; Nichol, 79.&lt;/ref&gt; These nouns are often used with a form of "to be" rather than "to have," e.g., "that was pwnage" rather than "he has pwnage". Either is a more emphatic way of expressing the simpler "he pwns," but the former implies that the person is ''embodying'' the trait rather than merely possessing it.

;''-ness'' suffix
:Derivation of a noun from an adjective stem is done by attaching ''-ness'' to any adjective. This is entirely the same as the English form, except it is used much more often in Leet. Nouns such as ''lulzness'' and ''leetness'' are derivations using this suffix.

;Words ending in ''-ed''
:When forming a past participle ending in ''-ed'', the Leet user may replace the ''-e'' with an apostrophe, as was common in [[poetry]] of previous centuries, (e.g. "pwned" becomes "pwn'd"). Sometimes, the apostrophe is removed as well (e.g. "pwned" becomes "pwnd"). The word ending may also be substituted by ''-t'' (e.g. ''pwned'' becomes ''pwnt'').&lt;ref name="blanc33"&gt;LeBlanc, 33.&lt;/ref&gt;

;Use of the ''-&amp;'' suffix
:Words ending in ''-and'', ''-anned'', ''-ant'', or a similar sound can sometimes be spelled with an [[ampersand]] (''&amp;'') to express the ending sound (e.g. "This is the [[Sandbox (software development)|s&amp;box]]," "I'm sorry, you've been b&amp;", "&amp;hill/&amp;farm"). This is most commonly used with the word ''banned.'' An alternate form of "B&amp;" is "B7", as the ampersand is typed with the "7" key in the standard US keyboard layout.  It is often seen in the phrase "IBB7" (in before banned), which indicates that the poster believes that a previous poster will soon be banned from the site, channel, or board on which they are both posting.

==Grammar==

Leet can be pronounced as a single syllable, {{IPA|/ˈliːt/}}, rhyming with ''eat,'' by way of [[aphesis]] of the initial vowel of "elite". It may also be pronounced as two syllables, {{IPA|/ɛˈliːt/}}. Like [[Jargon File|hacker slang]], leet enjoys a looser grammar than standard English.&lt;ref name=rome/&gt; The loose grammar, just like loose spelling, encodes some level of emphasis, ironic or otherwise. A reader must rely more on intuitive [[parsing]] of leet to determine the meaning of a sentence rather than the actual sentence structure. In particular, speakers of leet are fond of [[verbing]] nouns, turning verbs into nouns (and back again) as forms of emphasis, e.g. "Austin rocks" is weaker than "Austin roxxorz" (note spelling), which is weaker than "Au5t1N is t3h r0xx0rz" (note grammar), which is weaker than something like "0MFG D00D /\Ü571N 15 T3H l_l83Я 1337 Я0XX0ЯZ" ([[SMS language#Common abbreviations|OMG]], dude, Austin is the [[über]]-elite rocks-er!). In essence, all of these mean "Austin rocks," not necessarily the other options. Added words and misspellings add to the speaker's enjoyment. Leet, like hacker slang, employs analogy in construction of new words. For example, if ''haxored'' is the past tense of the verb "to hack" (hack → haxor → haxored), then ''winzored'' would be easily understood to be the past tense conjugation of "to win," even if the reader had not seen that particular word before.

Leet has its own colloquialisms, many of which originated as jokes based on common typing errors, habits of new computer users, or knowledge of [[cyberculture]] and history.&lt;ref name="goss 81"&gt;Blashki &amp; Nichol, 81.&lt;/ref&gt; Leet is not solely based upon one language or character set. Greek, Russian, and other languages have leet forms, and leet in one language may use characters from another where they are available. As such, while it may be referred to as a "[[cipher]]", a "dialect", or a "language", leet does not fit squarely into any of these categories. The term ''leet'' itself is often written ''31337'', or ''1337'', and many other variations. After the meaning of these became widely familiar, ''10100111001'' came to be used in its place, because it is the [[Binary numeral system|binary]] form of ''1337'' decimal, making it more of a puzzle to interpret.&lt;ref group="Notes"&gt;This appears as an in-joke for technical illustrations such as these: [[:Commons:File:Ami encoding.svg|''(a)'']][[:Commons:File:Manchester encoding.svg|''(b)'']]&lt;/ref&gt; An increasingly common characteristic of leet is the changing of grammatical usage so as to be deliberately incorrect. The widespread popularity of deliberate misspelling is similar to the cult following of the "[[All your base are belong to us]]" phrase. Indeed, the online and computer communities have been international from their inception, so spellings and phrases typical of non-native speakers are quite common.

==Vocabulary==

Many words originally derived from leet slang have now become part of the modern [[Internet slang]], such as "[[pwn]]ed".&lt;ref name=mitchell/&gt; The original driving forces of new vocabulary in leet were common misspellings and typing errors such as "[[teh]]" (generally considered lolspeak), and intentional misspellings,&lt;ref name="goss 83"&gt;Blashki &amp; Nichol, 83.&lt;/ref&gt; especially the "z" at the end of words ("skillz").&lt;ref name=mitchell/&gt; Another prominent example of a surviving leet expression is ''[[w00t]]'', an exclamation of joy.&lt;ref name=bbc/&gt; w00t is sometimes used as a [[backronym]] for "We owned the other team."

New words (or corruptions thereof) may arise from a need to make one's username unique. As any given Internet service reaches more people, the number of names available to a given user is drastically reduced. While many users may wish to have the username "CatLover," for example, in many cases it is only possible for one user to have the moniker. As such, degradations of the name may evolve, such as "C@7L0vr." As the leet cipher is highly dynamic, there is a wider possibility for multiple users to share the "same" name, through combinations of spelling and transliterations.

Additionally, ''leet''—the word itself—can be found in the [[User (computing)|screen-names]] and [[gamertags]] of many Internet and video games. Use of the term in such a manner announces a high level of skill, though such an announcement may be seen as baseless [[hubris]].&lt;ref name=hope&gt;Computer Hope Dictionary.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!-- NOTE: ANY FURTHER ADDITIONS MUST HAVE A PROPER REFERENCE OR WILL BE REMOVED PER WP:OR --&gt;

===Terminology and common misspellings===

''[[Warez]]'' (nominally {{IPAc-en|w|ɛər|z}}) is a plural shortening of "software", typically referring to cracked and redistributed software.&lt;ref name=hope/&gt; ''[[Phreaking]]'' refers to the hacking of telephone systems and other non-Internet equipment.&lt;ref name=mitchell/&gt; ''[[Teh]]'' originated as a typographical error of "the", and is sometimes spelled ''t3h''.&lt;ref name=mitchell/&gt;&lt;ref name="blanc34 35"&gt;LeBlanc, 34-35.&lt;/ref&gt; ''j00'' takes the place of "you",&lt;ref name=bbc/&gt; originating from the [[affricate]] sound that occurs in place of the [[palatal approximant]], {{IPA|/j/}}, when ''you'' follows a word ending in an [[alveolar consonant|alveolar]] [[plosive]] consonant, such as {{IPA|/t/}} or {{IPA|/d/}}. Also, from German, is ''[[wiktionary:Über|über]]'', which means "over" or "above"; it usually appears as a prefix attached to adjectives, and is frequently written without the [[Umlaut (diacritic)|umlaut]] over the ''u''.&lt;ref name=dutch&gt;Van de Velde &amp; Meuleman.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Haxor and suxxor (suxorz)===

''Haxor'', and derivations thereof, is leet for "hacker",&lt;ref name="blanc30 32"&gt;LeBlanc, 30; 32.&lt;/ref&gt; and it is one of the most commonplace examples of the use of the ''-xor'' suffix. ''Suxxor'' (pronounced suck-zor) is a derogatory term which originated in warez culture and is currently used in multi-user environments such as multiplayer video games and [[instant messaging]]; it, like ''haxor'', is one of the early leet words to use the ''-xor'' suffix. ''Suxxor'' is a modified version of "sucks" (the phrase "to suck"), and the meaning is the same as the English slang. Its negative definition essentially makes it the opposite of ''roxxor'', and both can be used as a verb or a noun. The letters ''ck'' are often replaced with the Greek Χ (chi) in other words as well.

===n00b===
{{main|Newbie}}

Within leet, the term ''n00b'', and derivations thereof, is used extensively. The word means and derives from ''newbie'' (as in new and inexperienced or uninformed),&lt;ref name="goss 83"/&gt;&lt;ref name=dutch/&gt;&lt;ref name=acronym/&gt; and is used as a means of segregating them as less than the "elite," or even "normal," members of a group.

===Owned and pwned===
{{Main|Owned|Pwn}}

''Owned'' and ''pwn3d'' (generally pronounced "owned" and "poned", respectively) both refer to the domination of a player in a video game or argument (rather than just a win), or the successful hacking of a website or computer.&lt;ref name=mitchell/&gt;&lt;ref name=dutch/&gt;&lt;ref name="blanc32 33"&gt;LeBlanc, 32-33.&lt;/ref&gt;

As is a common characteristic of leet, the terms have also been adapted into noun and adjective forms,&lt;ref name=dutch/&gt; ''ownage'' and ''pwnage'', which can refer to the situation of ''pwning'' or to the superiority of its subject (e.g., "He is a very good player. He is pwnage.").

===Pr0n&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Pr0n]] --&gt;===

''Pr0n'' is [[slang]] for ''[[pornography]]''.&lt;ref name=mitchell/&gt; This is a deliberately inaccurate spelling/pronunciation for ''porn'',&lt;ref name=acronym&gt;The Acronym Finder.&lt;/ref&gt; where a zero is often used to replace the letter O. It is sometimes used in legitimate communications (such as email discussion groups, [[Usenet]], chat rooms, and Internet web pages) to circumvent language and [[content filter]]s, which may reject messages as offensive or [[spam (electronic)|spam]]. The word also helps prevent [[search engines]] from associating commercial sites with pornography, which might result in unwelcome traffic.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} ''Pr0n'' is also sometimes spelled backwards (n0rp) to further obscure the meaning to potentially uninformed readers.&lt;ref group="Notes"&gt;This can be observed by searching for "n0rp" on a search engine.&lt;/ref&gt; It can also refer to [[ASCII art]] depicting pornographic images, or to photos of the internals of consumer and industrial hardware. ''Prawn'', a spoof of the misspelling, has started to come into use, as well; in ''[[Grand Theft Auto: Vice City]]'', a pornographer films his movies on "Prawn Island". Conversely, in the [[Role-playing game|RPG]] ''[[Kingdom of Loathing]]'', ''[[prawn]]'', referring to a kind of [[crustacean]], is spelled ''pr0n'', leading to the creation of food items such as "pr0n chow mein".

'''Linguistic criticism''' is probably the oldest form of [[biblical criticism]] or [[textual criticism]] to develop.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070311055432/http://campus.queens.edu/depts/history/Syllabi/H391%201st%20Christ/quest.htm Queens University of Charlotte, History Department]&lt;/ref&gt;  It relies heavily upon the study and knowledge of the Biblical languages - not just [[Koine Greek]] and [[Biblical Hebrew language|Hebrew]], but also [[Aramaic]] (the language Jesus himself most likely spoke) and [[Egyptian language|Egyptian]] (Moses' mother tongue).

Besides the influence that Aramaic and Egyptian would have on particular texts, i.e. the words we have written down in the extant Hebrew and Greek [[manuscripts]] being shaped into that form after first being contrived in the minds of writers whose mother tongues were Aramaic and Egyptian, we also have portions of texts written directly in those languages.

There are numerous Egyptian [[loanwords]] in the [[Torah]].  For instance, in the account of Moses being placed in the river in an ark (basket) behind the bullrushes (Sh'mot/Exodus 2:3), the words for ark, river, and bullrushes are all transliterated into Hebrew from Egyptian.  [[Abraham Yahuda|Yahuda]] counts at least eighteen Egyptian loanwords in the full account of Moses’ infancy.&lt;ref&gt;A. S. Yahuda, ''The Accuracy of the Bible'' (London: William Heinemann, Ltd., 1934), p. xxi.&lt;/ref&gt;  Large sections of Daniel and Ezra, as well as portions of Jeremiah and Nehemiah are written directly in Aramaic, as well as a few phrases found in the [[Synoptic Gospels]] and the [[Pauline epistles]].  Other languages that are very important for linguistic criticism include Akkadian, Ugaritic, and Latin.  Moreover, Arabic, Hittite, Eblamite, Canaanite, and Phoenician may be helpful depending on the interests of the critic.

Linguistic criticism is not the same as [[textual criticism]], though it does fall under that discipline.  Where textual criticism may examine phenomena that occur within a single language, like [[elision]], and even the likelihood of scribal error in recording what is dictated to him; linguistic criticism specifically inspects how languages affect one another in the process of translating from one to another, and how a language changes over time, [[psycholinguistics|psycholinguistically]] and aurally.

A scholar employing linguistic criticism would look at a passage such as Matthew 27: 46/Mark 15:34, which the Greek text renders as "My God, My God! Why have you deserted Me?" ([[Complete Jewish Bible|CJB]]), and instead of blindly accepting the Greek rendering of the Aramaic words Jesus spoke on the execution stake, would look to the Aramaic language for the meaning of that passage and discover that the Greek mistranslated it and that the correct interpretation is, in fact, "My God, My God! For this moment I have been spared!" or "My God, My God! This is my destination!"  It would be immediately obvious from a study of the Aramaic passage that the word in the text "shabaktani" does ''not'' mean ''forsaken'' or ''deserted'' (that word would be ''nashatani''); it means ''spared'' or ''destined''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.v-a.com/bible/matthew-27.html Victor Alexander,  ''Aramaic Bible'', (1998), footnote]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://rosicrucianzine.tripod.com/peshitta.htm Charles Weber.  “Peshitta: A New Look at an Old Book.”  ''Rays from the Rose Cross Magazine'', (March/April 1996)]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Marco Sgarbi''' (14 August 1982) is an Italian [[philosopher]] and an [[historian of knowledge]]. He is associate professor of history of philosophy and Vice Provost of Communication and Development at the [[Ca' Foscari University of Venice]].

==Biography==
Marco Sgarbi was born in 1982 in [[Mantua]], [[Italy]], and received his Ph.D. from the [[Università di Verona]]. He taught history of philosophy, history of concepts and computational linguistics for philosophical texts at the [[Università di Verona]] from 2010 to 2012.

He was Frances A. Yates Short-Term Research fellow at the [[Warburg Institute]], research fellow at the [[Università di Verona]], [[Fritz Thyssen]] fellow at [[Herzog August Bibliothek]], [[Wolfenbüttel]], research fellow at the [[Accademia dei Lincei]]–[[British Academy]], and Jean-François Malle-Harvard I Tatti Fellow at [[Villa I Tatti]], The Harvard University Center for Italian Renaissance Studies.

He is the editor of [http://philosophicalreadings.org/ Philosophical Readings],  a four-monthly on-line journal, and of Studies and Sources in the History of Philosophy Series by [http://www.aemmeedizioni.it Aemme Edizioni]. He is also member of the editorial board of [http://www.losguardo.net/ Lo Sguardo], [http://www.marilia.unesp.br/#!/departamentos/dfil/cpek/revista-estudos-kantianos/ Estudios Kantianos], [http://www.centrodefilosofia.com/publicacaodetalhe.php?id=190 philosophy@lisbon].
 
He is the Principal investigator of the [http://aristotleinthevernacular.org/ ERC Starting Grant 2013 - Aristotle in the Italian Vernacular: Rethinking Renaissance and Early-Modern Intellectual History (c. 1400–c. 1650)].

He is the editor of the series [http://www.bloomsbury.com/uk/series/bloomsbury-studies-in-the-aristotelian-tradition/ Bloomsbury Studies in the Aristotelian Tradition].

==Research==

His work has focused on [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]], [[Aristotelianism]], [[Renaissance philosophy]] and [[intellectual history]]. In his "Logica e metafisica nel Kant-precritico" and "La Kritik der reinen Vernunft nel contesto della tradizione logica aristotelica", Sgarbi follows [http://www.idih.org/wiki/Giorgio_Tonelli Giorgio Tonelli]'s investigations and he examines the intellectual situation of Königsberg in the years of the formation of the Kantian philosophy, assuming that Königsberg with its university are the framework from which Kant actually took fundamental ideas and problems. In particular he focuses on the Aristotelian tradition, on Schulphilosophie, and on the Eclectic movement, which dominated Königsberg up to the advent of Kant’s critical philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;[[Riccardo Pozzo]], Kant: «Bentornato Aristotele!», Il Sole-24 Ore, 11-7-2010, 35&lt;/ref&gt; In "La logica dell'irrazionale", which is also translated in Spanish, Sgarbi shows that the third Critique is neither a book on aesthetics nor on teleology, but on an hermeneutical not-conceptual logic.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jocelyn Benoist]], Che cos'è un'esperienza kantiana, Il Sole-24 Ore, 28-11-2010, 50&lt;/ref&gt; "Kant on Spontaneity" is the first full-length study of the problem of spontaneity in Kant. He demonstrates that spontaneity is a crucial concept in relation to every aspect of Kant's thought. He begins by reconstructing the history of the concept of spontaneity in the German Enlightenment prior to Kant and goes on to define knowing, thinking, acting and feeling as spontaneous activities of the mind that in turn determine Kant's logic, ethics and aesthetics. He shows that the notion of spontaneity is key to understanding both Kant's theoretical and practical philosophy.

In [[intellectual history]], he proposes an original methodology based on the [[history of problems]], in competition with the methodology of the [[history of ideas]] and [[Begriffsgeschichte]]. In his view, history of problem is 1) based on original elements of human experience; 2) always new, because the experience of problems and their solutions are always new; 3) rich, because to one problem refers to multiple ideas and conceptualities; 4) infinite, because the solutions and approaches to the problems are infinite; 5) interdisciplinary, because different sciences can solve the same problem from different points of view; 6) intercultural, because problems are common elements of the various civilizations; 7) able to open new ways to find new solutions.&lt;ref&gt;"Theory of the History of Problems.

In March 2014 at the [http://convention2.allacademic.com/one/rsa/rsa14/index.php?click_key=1&amp;cmd=Multi+Search+Search+Load+Session&amp;session_id=206269&amp;PHPSESSID=c1osaru00uq65dfoad55r33ih6 Renaissance Society of America Annual Meeting] in New York, Sgarbi presented his conception of Renaissance, called "Liquid Renaissance" and based on reflexive historiography. He employs “liquid” in the same way of contemporary historians and sociologist to characterize “[[Delegative democracy|liquid democracy]]” or “liquid society”, that is when one or more parts  of the whole constitute dynamically, voluntarily or involuntarily, the whole itself that circularly and continuously redefines the parts. He emphasizes that we cannot help seeing the past from the point of view of the present, but we should do it in a correct way, otherwise, certain aspects of the past may be overlooked or misunderstood. Renaissance should be carefully historically qualified according to time and place and should be constantly redefined according to the progress of scholarship, since what the Renaissance was or is shifts almost kaleidoscopically, establishing the existence of many Renaissances.

'''Maxwell John Charlesworth''' [[Order of Australia|AO]] [[Australian Academy of the Humanities|FAHA]] (30 December 1925 – 2 June 2014) was an Australian philosopher and public intellectual. He taught and wrote on a wide range of areas including the [[philosophy of religion]] and the [[Separation of church and state|role of the Church]] in a liberal democratic society, [[Australian Aboriginal culture]] and [[Australian Aboriginal mythology|religions]], European philosophy from [[Medieval philosophy|medieval]] to [[Continental philosophy|continental]], [[bioethics]] and modern science’s role in society, as well as the [[philosophy of education]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.smh.com.au/comment/obituaries/obituary-max-charlesworth-20140613-3a2zx.html|title=Obituary: Max Charlesworth|last=Kirsner|first=Douglas|date=13 June 2014|website=The Sydney Morning Herald|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1990, he was made an Officer of the [[Order of Australia]] for his contributions to Australian society in the fields of education and bioethics.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kirsner|first=Douglas|last2=Lee|first2=Jenny|date=Summer 1991|title=Introduction|url=|journal=Meanjin|volume=50|issue=4|pages=444–446|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Charlesworth has been described as 'exceptional among Australian philosophers for his integrity, for his capacity to change and develop as the balance of evidence shifted, and for his willingness to pioneer new developments.'&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Australian Religious Thought|last=Hudson|first=Wayne|publisher=Monash University Press|year=2015|isbn=9781922235763|location=|pages=152}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biography ==
Charlesworth was born in [[Numurkah]] in country [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] on 30 December 1925, the younger son of William and Mabel Charlesworth.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; He was educated at government schools in Numurkah, and then at [[Assumption College, Kilmore|Assumption College]], Kilmore. Charlesworth moved to [[Melbourne]] in order to study at the [[University of Melbourne]], obtaining a [[Bachelor of Arts]] with honours in 1946 and a [[Master of Arts|Masters of Arts]] in 1948.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;
[[File:Young MJC.jpg|thumb|Charlesworth as a young man]]
Charlesworth was awarded the first [[Daniel Mannix|Mannix]] Travelling Scholarship for overseas study in 1950, the same year he married Stephanie Charlesworth (née Armstrong).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; However, having contracted [[tuberculosis]], Charlesworth was forced to delay taking up the scholarship and spent the next two years at the Gresswell Sanatorium in Victoria.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

After recovering, Charlesworth followed the advice of his mentor, Professor [[Alexander Boyce Gibson]] and continued his postgraduate studies in 1953 at the [[Catholic University of Leuven (1834–1968)|Université Catholique de Louvain]] (UCL) in Belgium.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This decision was based on the University’s reputation for excellence in both [[theology]] and contemporary [[continental philosophy]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.humanities.org.au/Portals/0/documents/Fellows/Obituaries/MaxCharlesworth.pdf|title=Max Charlesworth|last=Coady|first=Tony|date=|website=Annual Report 2013-2014|publisher=Australian Academy of the Humanities|pages=28–30|access-date=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160301140500/http://humanities.org.au/Portals/0/documents/Fellows/Obituaries/MaxCharlesworth.pdf|archivedate=1 March 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was attracted in particular by the archives of [[Edmund Husserl]], the German [[phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenologist]], which were based at UCL, and indeed planned to write his dissertation on phenomenology. However his PhD supervisor, Professor [[Georges van Riet]], insisted that Charlesworth undertake instead a critical study of linguistic analysis, bringing Charlesworth into productive contact with leading Wittgensteinian philosophers such as [[Elizabeth Anscombe]] and [[Peter Geach]]. Charlesworth gained his [[Doctor of Philosophy|Doctorate in Philosophy]], ''avec la plus grande distinction'', from UCL in 1955 and was then appointed to a lectureship at the [[University of Auckland]] in 1956.

Charlesworth's first book, ''[https://www.amazon.com/Philosophy-Linguistic-Analysis-M-Charlesworth/dp/B0032QI5OC Philosophy and Linguistic Analysis]'', which was based on his PhD, was published in 1959, the same year he was appointed to the Philosophy Department at the University of Melbourne.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Over the next sixteen years at Melbourne, Charlesworth initiated a broad philosophical syllabus.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; He introduced a course on the philosophy of religion, to the dismay of many in the university community who thought the study of religion was inappropriate in a secular institution.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Charlesworth also established a course in [[Medieval philosophy]], a subject largely ignored in Australian philosophical circles until that point.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Perhaps most controversially, he introduced a course on [[continental philosophy]], encountering scepticism from his colleagues, the majority of whom were analytic philosophers.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

During his time at Melbourne University, Charlesworth was also a Nuffield Fellow at the [[Warburg Institute]] in London from 1963 until 1964 and a [[Visiting scholar|Visiting Professor]] at the [[University of Notre Dame]], Indiana, United States between 1968 and 1969.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hutchings|first=Patrick|date=December 2014|title=In Memoriam: Maxwell John Charlesworth|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11841-014-0457-6|journal=Sophia|edition= 4|volume=53|pages=425–426|doi=10.1007/s11841-014-0457-6|issn=1873-930X|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Charlesworth served as Chair of the Philosophy Department from 1974-1975&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; and was appointed Foundation Dean of Humanities at the new [[Deakin University]] in [[Geelong]] in 1975.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=McCarthy|first=Kathleen|date=December 2015|title=War and Peace: The Catholic Church, Max Charlesworth and B. A. Santamaria|url=https://search.informit.com.au/documentSummary;dn=761440500416413;res=IELHSS|journal=The Australasian Catholic Record|edition= 4|volume=92|pages=433–446|doi=|issn=0727-3215|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At Deakin Charlesworth created a distinctive philosophy department with interests in [[Psychoanalysis|psychoanalytic theory]], continental philosophy, religious studies, and [[Indian philosophy]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; He retired in 1990, and was appointed as [[Emeritus|Emeritus Professor]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

During his time at Deakin, Charlesworth became a Visiting Professor at the [http://www.fmsh.fr/en Fondation Maison des Sciences de l’Homme] in 1980. He was a Visiting Professor at his ''alma mater'', the [[Université catholique de Louvain|Université Catholique de Louvain]], in 1972 and again in 2006.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

Charlesworth’s influence extended beyond the academy; he believed that philosophy should concern itself less with arcane technicalities and more with the problems facing society.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; An example of his influence is his role as Chairman of the Victorian Consultative Committee for the [[United Nations]] [[International Year of Peace]] in 1986.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Charlesworth served on the National Consultative Committee on Bioethics as well as in the [[Government of Victoria (Australia)|Victorian Government]]'s Standing Committee on Infertility.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; He was also the Chair of the Advisory Committee for the [[Monash University|Monash University's]] [[Centre for Human Bioethics]] from 1987-1990,&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; before becoming the Director of the National Institute for Law, Ethics and Public Affairs at [[Griffith University]] in Queensland from 1992-1994.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

Charlesworth is also one of only two Australian philosophers (the other being [[John Passmore]]) to be invited to deliver the [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation|Australian Broadcasting Corporation's]] annual [[Boyer Lectures|Boyer lectures]]. In 1989, his series of lectures, entitled ''[http://catalogue.nla.gov.au/Record/2901029 Life, Death, Genes and Ethics: Biotechnology and Bioethics]'', focussed on the dilemmas in bioethics.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

For his contributions to Australian society in education and bioethics, Charlesworth was made and Officer of the [[Order of Australia]] in 1990.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; He was also elected as a Fellow of the Australian Academy of the Humanities.
[[File:MJC at home.jpg|thumb|Charlesworth at his Melbourne apartment]]
As a Catholic influenced by the ideas of [[John Henry Newman]], [[John Stuart Mill]], and [[John Courtney Murray]], Charlesworth had a strong commitment to the pivotal role of conscience in both religion and public life.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; This sometimes put him at odds with the hierarchy of the Australian [[Catholic Church]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Charlesworth opposed the anti-communist ‘Movement’ during the 1950s and 1960s, led by [[B. A. Santamaria|B. A. Santamaria’s]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; He considered that the Movement’s insistence that Christian values should have a privileged place in society distorted the proper relationship between Church and State.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Charlesworth aired his critique in the pages of the ''Catholic Worker'', a journal he co-edited, with [[C. A. J. Coady|Tony Coady]], in the late 1960s and early 1970s.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; The journal was denounced by members of the Catholic clergy and its distribution in Churches forbidden.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=B.A. Santamaria - Running The Show: Selected Documents 1939-1996|last=|first=|publisher=Miegunyah Press|year=2008|isbn=9780522854978|editor-last=Morgan|editor-first=Patrick|location=|pages=35–38}}&lt;/ref&gt; Integrating his liberal philosophy with a progressive social vision,&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Charlesworth and other contributors to the ''Catholic Worker'' questioned the moral case for the [[Vietnam War]] and Catholic teachings on [[Birth control|contraception]], [[abortion]], and [[divorce]] among others.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Some of this intellectual activism was inspired by developments in [[Second Vatican Council|Vatican II]], with the Council’s more accommodating and open attitudes to other religions and to the non-religious.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kelly|first=Gerard|date=April 2014|title=The Impact of the Second Vatican Council|url=|journal=Australasian Catholic Record|volume=91|issue=2|pages=146–159|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, in 1970, Charlesworth was appointed to the Vatican’s Secretariat for Non-Believers.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

Charlesworth's co-founded of the academic journal ''[[Sophia (journal)|Sophia]]'' with [[Graeme E. de Graaff]]  in 1962 to promote study of philosophy of religion.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Charlesworth was the co-editor of the journal from its inception until 1990.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; In 2012, the journal published a special 50th anniversary volume celebrating Charlesworth and his work, in which Charlesworth himself wrote an article entitled ‘[https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11841-012-0337-x Translating Religious Texts]’.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Charlesworth died in 2014 survived by his wife, Stephanie, their seven children, and eleven grandchildren.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

After his death, Charlesworth was awarded a posthumous Honorary [[Doctor of Letters|Doctorate of Letters]] in 2014 from [[Deakin University]] "for distinguished academic services in the fields of education, humanities and bioethics."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.deakin.edu.au/about-deakin/reputation/honorary-awards|title=Honorary Awards at Deakin University|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [http://www.foundationhouse.org.au/ Foundation House], the Victorian Foundation for Survivors of Tourture, of which Charlesworth was a founding patron, also instituted the annual Max Charlesworth Oration lecture series in his honour.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.foundationhouse.org.au/max-charlesworth-oration/|title=Foundation House - The Max Charlesworth Oration|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Philosophy ==
Charlesworth was classically trained in philosophy, but his approach to its practice was unusual for the time in Australia. He emphasised the importance of philosophical engagement in current social dilemmas and presentation of philosophical ideas accessibly.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

Charlesworth had a pluralistic approach to both philosophy and religion, which shaped his ideas on life in liberal democratic societies.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; This pluralism prompted Charlesworth to work on a wide range of topics. As he grew older he became less inclined to study concepts themselves and more inclined to study how knowledge is constructed and by whom.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;
[[File:MJC giving lecture.png|thumb|323x323px|Charlesworth delivering his ‘Liberal Education and Religious Values’ lecture at [[Monash University]]'s Religious Centre to mark the beginning of the Academic Year, 5 March 1981.]]

=== Religion ===
While Charlesworth was brought up as a Catholic, he came to challenge orthodox views on the relationship between Church and State.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Charlesworth was not solely interested in [[Catholicism]] or even just the greater Christian tradition: he had a fundamental curiosity in the variety of the world’s religions, how they worked, and why. He examined the way different religions responded to basic ethical questions, producing a children’s book, illustrated by [[Robert Ingpen]], entitled ''[http://trove.nla.gov.au/work/13453613?q&amp;sort=holdings+desc&amp;_=1458454882486&amp;versionId=22173819 Religious Worlds]''. Wayne Hudson has noted that "without abandoning his personal Catholicism, [Charlesworth] embraced the more stringent implications of pluralism within the framework of liberal political philosophy".&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; He came indeed to see all religions as creative inventions.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

=== Australian Aboriginal culture ===
Charlesworth wrote much on [[Australian Aboriginal land rights]], [[Australian Aboriginal culture|cultures]], and [[Australian Aboriginal mythology|religious]] traditions. Working with anthropologists, Charlesworth insisted that Aboriginal religions should be taken seriously in their own right as systems of spiritual meaning rather than simply as cultural artefacts.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

This was an aspect of his attempts to influence the way that Australian Settler society understood Aboriginal society.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

=== European philosophy ===
From [[medieval philosophy]] Charlesworth identified religious thinkers with modern relevance. He translated and commented on [[Anselm of Canterbury|St. Anselm’s]] ''[[Proslogion]]'' as well as 'The World Order', the 15th volume of [[Thomas Aquinas|St. Thomas Aquinas’]] [[Summa Theologica|''Summa Theologiae'']] from the original [[Latin]].&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; The role of translation continued to fascinate Charlesworth and his last article, written in 2012 for ''[[Sophia (journal)|Sophia]]'', was on the problems of translating religious texts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Charlesworth|first=Max|date=December 2012|title=Translating Religious Texts|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11841-012-0337-x|journal=Sophia|volume=51|issue=4|pages= 423–448|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Charlesworth was also engaged by contemporary European philosophies, from [[existentialism]] to [[Postmodernism/Philosophy|postmodernism]]. In 1975, Charlesworth produced a series of radio programmes for the [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation|ABC]], which were later turned into a book, called ''The Existentialists and Jean-Paul Sartre.'' These broadcasts introduced an Australian audience to the main tenets of existentialism, including through interviews with [[Jean-Paul Sartre]] and [[Simone de Beauvoir]], as well as various critiques.

=== Bioethics and the social role of science ===
The 1980s saw the development of new scientific technologies affecting human life, including [[Assisted reproductive technology|assisted reproductive technologies]] such as [[in vitro fertilisation]] and [[surrogacy]]. Debates about the ethical implications of these technologies were polarised between some scientists arguing for freedom in experimentation and some religious groups, contending for restraints on these developments in line with religious beliefs.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Singer|first=Peter|date=Summer 1991|title=A Philosopher among the Test Tubes|url=|journal=Meanjin|edition= |volume=50|issue=4|page=|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Charlesworth attempted to bridge the divide between the two groups, while acknowledging the difficulty of resolving ethical issues in a liberal democratic society where there exists no common standard of morality.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; These ideas are most fully developed in his [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation|ABC]] [[Boyer Lectures]] ''[http://catalogue.nla.gov.au/Record/2901029 Life, Death, Genes and Ethics: Biotechnology and Bioethics].''

Charlesworth was also concerned with the social role of modern science. He wrote on the effect of science in society, and on the nature of scientific communities themselves, co-authoring ''Life Among the Scientists''. This was an anthropological study of scientists at the [[Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research]] in Melbourne.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Life Among the Scientists: An Anthropological Study of an Australian Scientific Community|last=Charlesworth|first=Max|last2=Farrall|first2=Lyndsay|last3=Stokes|first3=Terry|last4=Turnbull|first4=David|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1989|isbn=0195549996|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Education ===
Charlesworth wrote extensively on the [[philosophy of education]], particularly the role of universities in modern society.

As Foundation Dean of Humanities at [[Deakin University]] in Geelong, Charlesworth worked to make higher education available to mature-age students and others who found access difficult, developing a model influenced by the [[Open University]] in the [[United Kingdom|UK]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Charlesworth devised [[Interdisciplinarity|interdisciplinary]] courses that brought many apparently disparate philosophical fields together. The idea was not to train professional philosophers but to allow philosophy to make a significant difference in people’s lives beyond the university.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This same ethos motivated Charlesworth's 2007 book ''[http://www.uqp.uq.edu.au/book.aspx/828/Philosophy%20For%20Beginners Philosophy for Beginners].''

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12658">'''''Property Rules, Liability Rules and Inalienability: One View of the Cathedral''''' is an article in the scholarly legal literature (''[[Harvard Law Review]]'', Vol.85, p.&amp;nbsp;1089, April 1972), authored by Judge [[Guido Calabresi]] (''of the [[United States Court of Appeals]] for the Second Circuit'') and A. [[Douglas Melamed]], currently a professor at [[Stanford Law School]].

The article is a seminal contribution to the field of [[law and economics]], offering an ambitious attempt to treat various areas of the law through a uniform approach. It is grounded in the fact that the various interests created by the law enjoy various degrees and methods of protection. Certain interests are deemed [[human right]]s and inalienable as such. Other interests are protected by the [[criminal law]]; meaning that the state will bear the cost of initiating legal action if violations of such interests are brought to its attention; here begins the criminal law. The burden of proof required for the state to prevail in such cases is higher; thus the beginning of [[criminal procedure]]. Other interests give an injured party merely the option of petitioning for [[injunctive relief]]. There are yet other interests whose violation gives the injured party no more than the right to seek monetary damages, and only if the victim is willing to bear the costs of initiating legal action; such interests make up the essence of [[Civil law (common law)|civil law]]. The burden of proof in such cases is less than in actions initiated under criminal law; thus the beginning of [[civil procedure]].

== Thesis ==
The title of the article references artist [[Claude Monet]]'s series of paintings of [[Rouen Cathedral]], modestly implying that the authors' ensuing academic analysis is but one look at a subject that can be considered from various points of view. The primary thesis of the article focuses on the notion of "entitlements," or rights, which can be protected by either property, liability, or inalienability rules. The authors' main goal, as noted in the Introduction, is to provide a conceptual framework within which the separate legal subject areas of Property and Torts can be approached from a unified perspective. The article then undertakes an analysis of the classic Law and Economics "Pollution Problem" and an analysis of various criminal sanctions, all within the new framework the authors have put forth.

== The Concept of Entitlements ==
The article begins by discussing the crucial concept of "entitlements," which are defined as the rights established and protected by law, the absence of which would result in a "[[might makes right]]" world where either the strongest or shrewdest emerge victorious  in any conflict. Thus, as the authors point out, the fundamental thing that law (the setting of entitlements) does is to decide which of the conflicting parties will be entitled to prevail. The authors also point out, however, that successfully enforcing these entitlements (the law) is as important as establishing them in order to avoid the "might makes right" world.  From this notion, the authors consider three types of entitlements: entitlements protected by property rules, entitlements protected by liability rules, and inalienable entitlements. According to Calabresi and Melamed, an entitlement protected by a property rule is one that must be bought in a voluntary transaction in which the value of the entitlement is agreed upon by the buyer and seller. With an entitlement protected by property rule, a collective decision is made as to who is to be given the initial entitlement, but not as to the value of the entitlement itself. An entitlement protected by a liability rule, however, involves a collective decision as to the value of the entitlement without the need for a voluntary transaction. A destroyer of an initial entitlement protected by a liability rule must pay an objectively valued sum to the holder of the entitlement. The final entitlement the authors consider in the article is an entitlement protected by an inalienability rule. As the authors define it, an entitlement is inalienable to the extent that its transfer is not permitted between a willing buyer and a willing seller. Under this rule, the state intervenes to determine the initial entitlement, to forbid its sale or purchase, and to determine compensation to be paid if it is sold or destroyed. To conceptualize these three entitlements, the authors use the example of an individual homeowner whose house may be protected by a property rule where another individual wishes to purchase it, a liability rule where the government seizes the home by eminent domain, or an inalienability rule where the homeowner is drunk or incompetent. Having defined the concept of entitlements and laid out the three rules that they will focus on, the article proceeds to explore the following two questions: (1) In what circumstances should a particular entitlement be granted? And, (2) In what circumstances should a property, liability or inalienability rule be used to protect an entitlement?

== The Birth of Rule 4 ==
In answering these questions, Calabresi and Melamed expanded upon the pre-existing Law and Economics literature and added to the discussion the breakthrough that has come to be known as "Rule 4." In keeping with the classic Law and Economics hypothetical of the Polluter and the Resident (whereby P (Polluter)'s affirmative actions have encroached upon R (Resident)'s passive enjoyment of his property), the authors advocate a novel approach to the problem whereby a court might permit Polluter to continue his actions unless Resident chose to pay Polluter damages in order to enjoin further pollution. Modeled along with the traditional Law and Economics approaches to the Polluter / Resident problem, the scheme of available remedies appears thus:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Initial Entitlement
! Injunction / Property Rule
! Damages / Liability Rule
|-
| ''Resident''
| Rule 1: Court issues an injunction against Polluter
| Rule 2: Court finds a nuisance but permits pollution to continue if the Polluter chooses to pay damages
|-
| ''Polluter''
| Rule 3: Court finds the pollution not to be a nuisance and permits the Polluter to continue without paying damages
| Rule 4: Court permits Polluter to continue unless Resident chooses to pay Polluter damages in order to enjoin further pollution
|}

Coincidentally, at approximately the same time that Calabresi and Melamed postulated their Rule 4 as an additional approach to the Polluter / Resident problem, an [[Arizona Supreme Court|Arizona state supreme court]] decision independently illustrated the practical application of the "Rule 4" approach in deciding a case that had come before the court. In 1972 in ''[[Spur Industries, Inc. v. Del E. Webb Development Co.]]'', [[Del E. Webb Construction Company|Del Webb]], an Arizona real-estate developer developing a retirement community, sued for an injunction against Spur Industries, a pre-existing feedlot owner whose activities resulted in an alleged nuisance to the encroaching retirement community (causing Del Webb difficulties in selling properties close to the feedlot). In handing down its decision, the Arizona state supreme court ruled that Spur Industries' activities did create a nuisance, but Del Webb had come to the nuisance and brought its unwitting retirees along with it. Balancing the various factors in the case, including the fact that Del Webb but not Spur Industries could have foreseen the nuisance problem and the fact that the residents of the retirement community had been dragged to the nuisance unwittingly, the court ruled that Spur Industries would be forced to move, but that Del Webb had to indemnify the business for its troubles.

Though independent of Calabresi and Melamed's article, Spur Industries proved that "Rule 4's" novel approach could be practicably applied. Furthermore, Spur Industries showed that a successful balancing of efficiency, distributional, and other justice concerns, concerns articulated in the article that Calabresi and Melamed intended Rule 4 to blend, could be achieved.

== Rule 5: An Expansion of the Cathedral ==
With the opportunity to use either liability or property-based rules to protect entitlements, the academic community soon concluded that the key to figuring out which rule to use turned on the transaction costs. Therefore, if there were low transaction costs, then property rules should be used. If the transaction costs were high, then liability rules should be used.&lt;ref name="Krier1995p451"&gt;Krier &amp; Schwab (1995), p. 451.&lt;/ref&gt; 
   
[[A. Mitchell Polinsky]], Josephine Scott Crocker Professor of Law and Economics at [[Stanford Law School]], argued that transactions costs are not the only impediments to bargaining, there is also the problem of assessment costs.&lt;ref name="Krier1995p453"&gt;Krier &amp; Schwab (1995), p. 453.&lt;/ref&gt; Assessment costs are the costs associated in obtaining and processing information.&lt;ref name="Krier1995p453" /&gt;  There is a long understanding in the academic community that when transaction costs are high a liability rule will help substitute for bargaining.&lt;ref name="Krier1995p454"&gt;Krier &amp; Schwab (1995), p. 454.&lt;/ref&gt; Judges, however, may have a difficult time in obtaining and processing information in order to assess damages. There are two ways to assess damages. An objective method uses the market price. The market price, however, can underestimate the truth of the matter. A subjective method of calculation is the alternative. Under the subjective method, the amount of damages is the minimum price the entitlement holder would accept in a bilateral exchange. Unfortunately, the objective method does not capture the correct amount of damages, and the subjective method would be difficult for a judge to implement

Rule 5, as advocated by [[James E. Krier]], Earl Warren DeLano Professor of Law at the [[University of Michigan Law School]], and [[Stewart Schwab]], Professor of Law at [[Cornell Law School]], in ''Property Rules and Liability Rules: the Cathedral in another Light'' provides for a solution for the shortfalls of Rule 4. Under Rule 5, the court would use a best-chooser principle:

All other things being equal, when liability rules are used the party who is the best chooser should be confronted with the decision whether or not to force a sale upon the other party.&lt;ref name="Krier1995p470"&gt;Krier &amp; Schwab (1995), p. 470.&lt;/ref&gt; 
Krier and Schwab argue that the best-chooser principle is "faithful to the approach of Calabrasi &amp; Melamed [because] other things being equal, costs of activity 'should be put on the party or activity which can with the lowest transaction costs act … to correct an error in entitlements by inducing the party who can avoid social costs most cheaply to do so.'"&lt;ref name="Krier1995p87"&gt;Krier &amp; Schwab (1995), p. 87.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first step in implementing Rule 5 begins with picking the best chooser. Usually, the best chooser is the smallest number party. The best chooser will then have to "compare its own opportunity cost to the opportunity cost (figured by the judge) of the other party or parties."&lt;ref name="Krier1995p471"&gt;Krier &amp; Schwab (1995), p. 471.&lt;/ref&gt; The second step is the implementation of the double-reverse twist proposed by Krier and Schwab.  First, the judge estimates the other party's social costs (damages caused by the best chooser).&lt;ref name="Krier1995p471" /&gt;  Then, the judge enters an order requiring the best chooser to decide whether to continue causing damage to the other party without receiving any compensation or stop causing damage and receive compensation.&lt;ref name="Krier1995p471" /&gt;  Therefore, if the best chooser decides to stop causing harm to the other party, then the other party will have to pay the best chooser damages calculated by the judge. Should the best chooser decide to stay, then the best chooser continues to cause harm and receives no payment.

The '''Rahbani Brothers''' ({{lang-ar|'''الأخوان رحباني'''}}), [[Assi Rahbani]] ({{lang-ar|'''عاصي الرحباني'''}}; May 4, 1923 – June 21, 1986), and [[Mansour Rahbani]] ({{lang-ar|'''منصور الرحباني'''}}; born 1925 – January 13, 2009) were Lebanese [[composers]], musicians, songwriters, authors, playwrights/dramatists. They are best known for their work with [[Lebanese people|Lebanese]] singer [[Fairuz]].

==History==
===Early career===
Coming originally from "Rahbe" a simple town in the North of Lebanon , the Rahbani Brothers were not involved in music besides the extensive reading that their parents made sure they had. Though Assi and Mansour occasionally helped the local priest in arranging the vocals and instrumentation of their [[Antiochian Orthodox Church|Antiochian Orthodox]] [[Divine Liturgy|liturgies]], their musical career began when Assi obtained a job at the Near East Radio channel.

While working as police officers in [[Beirut]], Mansour and Assi started at the radio channel as paperboys, dealing with the music sheets and lyrical editing. They eventually composed their own jingle and suggested it to the supervisor at the channel, [[Halim El Roumi]], the father of singer [[Majida El Roumi]]. He was impressed with their effort and further encouraged them by paying them for their work and broadcasting it on the channel airwaves. The jingles or pieces were usually broadcast live and the brothers' perfectionism became one of their trademarks as they demanded a lot of time in rehearsal and preparation and efforts from the singers to yield the maximal results.

In 1951, Nouhad Haddad (later known as [[Fairuz]]), one of the singers in the channel's chorus, came to the attention of [[Halim El Roumi]]. Assi composed her very first song, "Itab" ("Blame").

Halim el-Roumi attended the recording session and asked Assi to compose additional songs for her. Assi and Mansour Rahbani and Fairuz soon became one of the most prominent groups on the Lebanese music scene. The trio released about 50 songs in the following three years and found it more convenient to split from the channel and work on their own without the employment restrictions. The Rahbani Brothers and Fairuz became a musical team.  Both of the Rahbani Brothers composed and both of them wrote lyrics as they always clarified in interviews and as attested by their family members as well as by artists who collaborated and worked with them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= The Sword Breaks The Song Continues, Literacy in the Rahbani brothers' work of art |last= Chouairi |first= Rajaa | authorlink= |author2= |year= 2006 |publisher= [Hofstra University] |location= NY |isbn= 9781109863918 |url= |page= 86 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
     
In 1953, Assi proposed to Fairuz and the couple was married in 1954.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Colors of Enchantment: Theater, Dance, Music, and the Visual Arts of the Middle East |last= Zuhur |first= Sherifa |authorlink= |author2= |year= 2001 |publisher= [[American University in Cairo]] Press |location= Cairo &lt;!--|isbn= 977-424-607-1--&gt; |url= |page= 307 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1957, the trio performed for the first time at the [[Baalbeck International Festival]]; it was the first time that local Lebanese artists had appeared in the festival.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Popular Culture and Nationalism in Lebanon |last= Stone |first= Christopher |authorlink= |author2= |year= 2007 |publisher= [[Routledge]] |location=  |isbn= 0-203-93932-8 |url= |page= 3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The 1960s===

Fairuz and the Rahbani Bros started building their career based on the numerous songs they recorded and released. Radio and TV became the primary media through which their music was spread. Assi and Mansour also began writing musicals, plays with musical dialogs, and interpretations of patriotic themes that appealed to the Lebanese public.

The musicals mostly focused on the village life, the innocence of growing up, the problems of love, parental care, and the mischief of youth. One of them was made into a feature movie, ''Biyya'el Khawatem'' (''Rings Merchant'') directed by Egyptian film director [[Youssef Chahine]].

===The 1970s===

During the 1970s, the trio's combined sales passed the 30 million mark due to the international exposure of their music. The Rahbani Brothers also launched the careers of artists who first worked as backup singers for Fairuz or acted in their musicals; many of them became major forces in the Arab music industry. Georgette Sayegh, [[Najat Al Saghira]], [[Sabah (singer)|Sabah]], [[Wadih El Safi]], Ronza, Fadia Tanb El-Hage, and Huda, Fairuz's younger sister were the most prominent of the Rahbani Brothers' proteges.

Fairuz, Assi, and Mansour were introduced to the Western world during their 1971 tour of the United States. Initially, managers and event-organizers in the US doubted the popularity and drawing power of Fairuz and the Rahbani Brothers. However, after a concert of June 6, 1971 at [[Carnegie Hall]] sold out, Fairuz proved that she could be a viable artist abroad. After four months of extensively touring the US, Canada, and Mexico, the trio returned to Beirut where Assi and Mansour started working on the musical ''Al Mahatta'' (''The Station''), and a TV show called ''Al Mawasem'' (''Seasons'') starring Huda.

On September 22, 1972 Assi suffered a brain hemorrhage and was rushed to the hospital. Fans crowded outside the hospital praying for him and lighting candles. After three surgeries, Assi's brain hemorrhage was halted.
[[Ziad Rahbani]], the eldest son of Fairuz and Assi, at age 16, decided to take over his father's composition for the musical ''Saaloui n'Nass'' (''The People Asked Me''). Three months after suffering the hemorrhage, Assi attended the premiere performance of the musical in [[Piccadilly Theatre (Beirut)|Piccadilly Theatre]] in [[Rue Hamra|Hamra Street]]. [[Elias Rahbani]], Assi's younger brother, took over the orchestration and musical arrangement for the performance.

Within a year, Assi had returned to composing and writing with his brother. They continued to produce musicals, which became increasingly political in nature. After the [[Lebanese Civil War]] erupted, the brothers continued to use political satire and sharp criticism in their plays. In 1977, their musical ''Petra'' was shown in both the Muslim western and Christian eastern portions of [[Beirut]].

In 1978, the trio toured Europe and the Gulf nations, including a concert at the [[Paris Olympia]]. As a result of this busy schedule, Assi's medical and mental health began to deteriorate. Fairuz and the brothers agreed to end their professional and personal relationship in 1979. Fairuz began to work with a production team helmed by her son, [[Ziad Rahbani]], whilst Assi and Mansour composed for other artists such as Ronza.

===The 1980s===

Assi and Mansour Rahbani continued to compose musicals for Ronza and Fadia Tanb El-Hage (Ronza's sister). They re-made their musical ''Al Sha'khs'' (''The Person'') which they had first performed with Fairuz in the early-1970s. The songs were re-recorded with Ronza's voice; the production featured a small role played by Rima Rahbani, Fairouz's and Assi's daughter.

On June 26, 1986 Assi Rahbani died after spending several weeks in a coma. The nation went into mourning. He was buried in East Beirut; in order to make way for his funeral procession, the city's warring Muslim and Christian factions declared a cease fire and opened the city's checkpoints.{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}}

===The 1990s===

In the summer of 1998, Fairouz, Mansour Rahbani, Elias Rahbani, and Ziad Rahbani re-staged a number of their old musicals at the [[Baalbeck International Festival]]. The sold out shows ended with three new songs composed by Mansour and Elias Rahbani, their first collaboration in almost 25 years. 
At the end of the show, Fairouz sang to Assi: "I came to Baalbeck after 20 years, asking where you are, but no one could tell me. Don't say you are not here, your shadow is still fluttering on these stairs, calling into the echoes..." {{Citation needed|date=October 2008}}

==Critical interpretation – links to critical articles ==

A dearth of artistic-literary criticism exists on the works of the Rahbani Brothers, Ziad Rahbani, and Fairouz. One of the main reasons being their works are seen from a Nationalistic point of view. Proper literary criticism remains to be created most probably in later years. However, one of the most important literary interpretations are found in Nizar Mroueh's "In Lebanese Arabic Music and the Rahbani Musical Theatre".&lt;ref&gt;في الموسيقى اللبنانية العربية والمسرح الغنائي الرحباني"، نزار مروة&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8660">{{Anthroposophy}}
[[Rudolf Steiner]] developed exercises aimed at cultivating new [[cognitive]] faculties he believed would be appropriate to contemporary individual and cultural development. According to Steiner's view of history, in earlier periods people were capable of direct spiritual perceptions, or [[clairvoyance]], but not yet of rational thought; more recently, rationality has been developed at the cost of spiritual perception, leading to the [[Social alienation|alienation]] characteristic of modernity. Steiner proposed that humanity now has the task of synthesizing the rational and contemplative/spiritual components of cognition, whereby spiritual perception would be awakened through intensifying thinking.&lt;ref name=RAMcD/&gt; 

A central principle of Steiner's proposed path to spiritual development is that [[self-development]] - inner transformation - is a necessary part of the spiritual path: "for every step in spiritual perception, three steps are to be taken in [[morality|moral development]]." According to the spiritual philosophy Steiner founded, [[anthroposophy]], moral development:&lt;ref name="Schneider"&gt;Peter Schneider, ''Einführung in die Waldorfpädogogik'', Klett-Cotta, 1982, {{ISBN|3-608-93006-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Hemleben&gt;Johannes Hemleben, ''Rudolf Steiner: A documentary biography'', Henry Goulden Ltd, 1975, {{ISBN|0-904822-02-8}}, pp. 91-94 (German edition: Rowohlt Verlag, 1990, {{ISBN|3-499-50079-5}})&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Tummer&gt;Lía Tummer, ''Rudolf Steiner and Anthroposophy for Beginners'', Writers and Readers Publishing, 2001, {{ISBN|0-86316-286-X}}, pp. 79-84&lt;/ref&gt;
* reveals the extent to which a person has achieved control over his or her inner life;
* ensures that he or she lives in harmony with the surrounding natural and social world;
* correlates with his or her progress in spiritual development, the fruits of which are given in spiritual perception; and
* guarantees the capacity to distinguish between true perceptions and illusions, or to distinguish in any perception between the influence of subjective elements and objective realities.

==Meditative path==
Steiner described three stages of meditative progress: imaginative cognition, inspiration and intuition.&lt;ref name="Hammer"&gt;Olav Hammer, ''Claiming Knowledge'', {{ISBN|90-04-13638-X}}, pp. 424ff&lt;/ref&gt; 

*In imaginative cognition, the meditant aims to achieve thinking independent of sensory perception through concentration on either visual forms of symbolic significance never encountered in the sensory world (e.g. a black cross with a circle of seven red roses superimposed upon it), metamorphoses (e.g. the growth cycle of a plant from seed to mature flower), or mantric verses spoken aloud or silently (e.g. verses for each week of the year intended to connect the meditant with the rhythms of nature).
*In inspiration, the meditant seeks to eliminate all consciously chosen meditative content to open a receptive space in which objective spiritual content (impressions stemming from objective spiritual beings) may be encountered. The meditative activity established in inspirative cognition is set forth without concrete content.
*The stage of intuition is achieved through practicing exercises of will (e.g. reviewing the sequence of the day's events in reverse order).&lt;ref name="Willmann"&gt;Carlo Willmann, ''Waldorfpädogogik: Theologische und religionspädagogische Befunde'', Böhlau Verlag, 1998, {{ISBN|3-412-16700-2}}, pp. 11-14&lt;/ref&gt; At this stage, the meditant seeks unity with the creative forces of the cosmos without any loss of his or her individualized consciousness.

This sequence of meditative stages has the ultimate goal of the meditant experiencing his or her own karma and previous incarnations, as well as the "Akashic record" of historical events.&lt;ref name="Hammer"/&gt;

==Preliminary requirements for embarking on a spiritual training==
Steiner believed that in order for a spiritual training to bear "healthy fruits," a person would have to attend to the following:&lt;ref name=Hemleben/&gt;&lt;ref name=Tummer/&gt;&lt;ref name="Willmann"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt; Florin Lowndes 'Enlivening the Chakra of the Heart: The Fundamental Spiritual Exercises of Rudolf Steiner' {{ISBN|1-85584-053-7}} &lt;/ref&gt;

*Striving to develop a healthy body and soul.
*Feeling connected with all of existence; to recognize oneself in everything, and everything in oneself; not to judge others without standing in their shoes.
*Recognizing that one's thoughts and feelings have as significant an influence as one's deeds, and that work on one's inner life is as important as work on one's outer life.
*Recognizing that the true essence of a human being does not lie in the person's outer appearance, but rather in the inner nature, in the soul and spiritual existence of this person. 
*Finding the genuine balance between having an open heart for the demands of the outer world and maintaining inner strength and "unshakeable endurance."
*The ability to be true to a decision once made, even in the face of daunting adversity, until one comes to the conclusion that it was or is made in error.
*Developing thankfulness for everything that meets us, and that universal love which allows the world to reveal itself fully to oneself.

==Supplementary exercises==
Steiner suggested that a special group of general exercises should accompany all meditational practices as a measure of protection against possible negative influences caused by the meditation in the life of the individual. These six exercises are:&lt;ref name=Tummer/&gt;&lt;ref name="Willmann"/&gt;
* Practicing self-control over one's thinking. For example: for a period of time -at least five minutes- contemplate any object and concentrate one's thoughts exclusively on this object. (A pencil or a paper clip might do.)
* Development of initiative. For example, choose any positive but free deed, i.e. one that nothing is influencing you to do, and choose a regular time of day or day of the week to practice this. 
* Equanimity. Quiet reactive emotions. 
* Positivity. See the positive aspects of everything, and make the best out of every situation.
* Open-mindedness. Be open to new experiences and ideas, never letting expectations based upon the past close your mind to the lessons of the moment.
* Harmony. Find a harmonious, balanced relationship between the above five qualities, practicing them regularly and becoming able to move dynamically between them.

The initial three exercises are intended to enable a person to attain self-discipline in [[thinking]], [[Will (philosophy)|willing]] and [[feeling]].&lt;ref name=RAMcD&gt;Robert A. McDermott, "Rudolf Steiner and Anthroposophy", in Faivre and Needleman, ''Modern Esoteric Spirituality'', {{ISBN|0-8245-1444-0}}, pp. 303ff&lt;/ref&gt;

==Individual exercises==
Exercises developed in anthroposophy include:
*Review of the day. Each evening, going backwards through the day recalling its events, its sequential unfolding (experienced here reversed in time), the people one has met, etc.
*Experiencing the year's unfolding. Exercises Steiner suggested here include:
**Drawing the same plant or tree or landscape over the course of a year.
**Meditating the sequence of 52 mantric verses that Steiner wrote to deepen one's experience of the course of the seasons and the year and to bring the inner life of the soul into dialogue with nature, the ''Soul Calendar''.&lt;ref&gt;''Calendar of the Soul: Facsimile Edition of the Original Book Containing the Calendar Created by Rudolf Steiner for the Year 1912-1913'' {{ISBN|978-0880105347}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Preface to the Second Edition (1918)[http://wn.rsarchive.org/Articles/GA040/English/AP1982/GA040_preface.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sexual selection''' is a mode of [[natural selection]] where members of one [[biological sex]] [[mate choice|choose mates]] of the other [[sex]] to [[mating|mate]] with (intersexual selection), and compete with members of the same sex for access to members of the opposite sex (intrasexual selection). These two forms of selection mean that some individuals have better [[reproductive success]] than others within a [[population]], either from being more attractive or preferring more attractive partners to produce [[offspring]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Biology: The Unity &amp; Diversity of Life |year=2013 |publisher=Cengage Learning |page=281 |author=Cecie Starr |edition=Ralph Taggart, Christine Evers, Lisa Starr}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="PHYS-20140129"&gt;{{cite news |last=Vogt |first=Yngve |title=Large testicles are linked to infidelity |url=http://phys.org/news/2014-01-large-testicles-linked-infidelity.html |date=January 29, 2014 |work=[[Phys.org]] |accessdate=January 31, 2014 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140131114327/http://phys.org/news/2014-01-large-testicles-linked-infidelity.html |archivedate=January 31, 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, in the breeding season, [[sexual selection in frogs]] occurs with the males first gathering at the water's edge and making their [[mating call]]s: croaking. The females then arrive and choose the males with the deepest croaks and best territories. Generalizing, males benefit from frequent mating and monopolizing access to a group of fertile females. Females have a limited number of offspring they can have and they maximize the return on the energy they invest in reproduction.

The concept was first articulated by [[Charles Darwin]] and [[Alfred Russel Wallace]] who described it as driving species adaptations and that many organisms had evolved features whose function was deleterious to their individual survival,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Darwin |first1=Charles |author2=A.

Sexual selection can, typically, lead males to extreme efforts to demonstrate their [[fitness (biology)|fitness]] to be chosen by females, producing [[sexual dimorphism]] in [[secondary sexual characteristic]]s, such as the ornate [[plumage]] of [[birds]] such as [[birds of paradise]] and  [[peafowl]], or the antlers of [[deer]], or the manes of [[lion]]s, caused by a [[positive feedback]] mechanism known as a [[Fisherian runaway]], where the passing-on of the desire for a trait in one sex is as important as having the trait in the other sex in producing the runaway effect. Although the [[sexy son hypothesis]] indicates that females would prefer male offspring, [[Fisher's principle]] explains why the [[sex ratio]] is 1:1 almost without exception. Sexual selection is also found in [[plant]]s and [[fungi]].

The maintenance of sexual reproduction in a highly competitive world is one of the major puzzles in biology given that [[asexual reproduction]] can reproduce much more quickly as 50% of offspring are not males, unable to produce offspring themselves. Many non-exclusive hypotheses have been proposed,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Hartfield |first1=Matthew |author2=P. D.

== History ==

=== Darwin ===
Sexual selection was first proposed by Charles Darwin in ''[[The Origin of Species]]'' (1859) and developed in ''[[The Descent of Man and Selection in Relation to Sex]]'' (1871), as he felt that natural selection alone was unable to account for certain types of non-survival adaptations. He once wrote to a colleague that "The sight of a feather in a [[peahen|peacock]]'s tail, whenever I gaze at it, makes me sick!" His work divided sexual selection into male-male competition and female choice.

{{quote|... depends, not on a struggle for existence, but on a struggle between the males for possession of the females; the result is not death to the unsuccessful competitor, but few or no offspring.&lt;ref name=origin&gt;Darwin, Charles (1859). On the Origin of Species (1st edition). Chapter 4, page 88. "And this leads me to say a few words on what I call Sexual Selection. This depends ..." {{cite web |url=http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=side&amp;itemID=F373&amp;pageseq=12 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-05-22 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111105031643/http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=side&amp;itemID=F373&amp;pageseq=12 |archivedate=2011-11-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

{{quote|... when the males and females of any animal have the same general habits ... but differ in structure, colour, or ornament, such differences have been mainly caused by sexual selection.&lt;ref&gt;Darwin, Charles (1859). On the Origin of Species (1st edition). Chapter 4, page 89. {{cite web |url=http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=side&amp;itemID=F373&amp;pageseq=12 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-05-22 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111105031643/http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=side&amp;itemID=F373&amp;pageseq=12 |archivedate=2011-11-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

These views were to some extent opposed by [[Alfred Russel Wallace]], mostly after Darwin's death. He accepted that sexual selection could occur, but argued that it was a relatively weak form of selection. He argued that male-male competitions were forms of natural selection, but that the "drab" peahen's coloration is itself adaptive as [[camouflage]]. In his opinion, ascribing mate choice to females was attributing the ability to judge standards of beauty to animals (such as [[beetle]]s) far too cognitively undeveloped to be capable of [[aesthetic]] feeling.&lt;ref name="Wallace"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Wallace|first1=Alfred Russel|title=Note on Sexual Selection (S459: 1892)|url=http://people.wku.edu/charles.smith/wallace/S459.htm|publisher=Smith, Charles|accessdate=13 January 2017|date=1892|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170217215250/http://people.wku.edu/charles.smith/wallace/S459.htm|archivedate=17 February 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ronald Fisher ===

[[Ronald Fisher]], the [[England|English]] [[statistician]] and [[evolutionary biologist]] developed a number of ideas about sexual selection in his 1930 book ''[[The Genetical Theory of Natural Selection]]'' including the [[sexy son hypothesis]] and [[Fisher's principle]]. The [[Fisherian runaway]] describes how sexual selection accelerates the preference for a specific ornament, causing the preferred trait and female preference for it to increase together in a [[positive feedback]] runaway cycle. In a remark that was not widely understood&lt;ref name=Blind /&gt; for another 50 years he said:

{{quote|... plumage development in the male, and sexual preference for such developments in the female, must thus advance together, and so long as the process is unchecked by severe counterselection, will advance with ever-increasing speed. In the total absence of such checks, it is easy to see that the speed of development will be proportional to the development already attained, which will therefore increase with time [[exponential growth|exponentially]], or in [[geometric progression]]. —''Ronald Fisher, 1930''}}

[[File:South Africa-Tshwane-Rietvlei-Long-tailed Widowbird-01 cropped.jpg|thumb|Male [[long-tailed widowbird]]]]

This causes a dramatic increase in both the male's conspicuous feature and in female preference for it, resulting in marked [[sexual dimorphism]], until practical physical constraints halt further exaggeration. A [[positive feedback]] loop is created, producing extravagant physical structures in the non-limiting sex. A classic example of female choice and potential runaway selection is the [[long-tailed widowbird]]. While males have long tails that are selected for by female choice, female tastes in tail length are still more extreme with females being attracted to tails longer than those that naturally occur.&lt;ref&gt;Andersson, M, Sexual Selection, Princeton University Press, Princeton, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt; Fisher understood that female preference for long tails may be passed on genetically, in conjunction with genes for the long tail itself. Long-tailed widowbird offspring of both sexes inherit both sets of genes, with females [[Gene expression|expressing]] their genetic preference for long tails, and males showing off the coveted long tail itself.&lt;ref name=Blind /&gt;

[[Richard Dawkins]] presents a non-mathematical explanation of the runaway sexual selection process in his book ''[[The Blind Watchmaker]]''.&lt;ref name=Blind&gt;Dawkins, Richard (1986). [https://books.google.com/books?id=sPpaZnZMDG0C&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q=%22sexual%20selection%22&amp;f=false The Blind Watchmaker]. Longman, London. Published in Penguin Books 1988, 1991, and 2006. Chapter 8, Explosions and Spirals.&lt;/ref&gt; Females that prefer long tailed males tend to have mothers that chose long-tailed fathers. As a result, they carry both sets of genes in their bodies. That is, genes for long tails and for preferring long tails become [[Linkage disequilibrium|linked]]. The taste for long tails and tail length itself may therefore become correlated, tending to increase together. The more tails lengthen, the more long tails are desired. Any slight initial imbalance between taste and tails may set off an explosion in tail lengths. Fisher wrote that:

{{quote|The exponential element, which is the kernel of the thing, arises from the rate of change in hen taste being proportional to the absolute average degree of taste. —''Ronald Fisher, 1932''&lt;ref&gt;[[Ronald Fisher]] in a letter to [[Charles Galton Darwin]], 22 November 1932, cited in Fisher, R. A., Bennett, J. H. 1999. ''The genetical theory of natural selection: A complete variorum edition'', Oxford University Press, Oxford, p. 308&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[File:Peacock Flying.jpg|thumb|The peacock tail in flight, the classic example of a [[Fisherian runaway]]]]

The female widow bird chooses to mate with the most attractive long-tailed male so that her progeny, if male, will themselves be attractive to females of the next generation - thereby fathering many offspring that carry the female's genes. Since the rate of change in preference is proportional to the average taste amongst females, and as females desire to secure the services of the most sexually attractive males, an additive effect is created that, if unchecked, can yield exponential increases in a given taste and in the corresponding desired sexual attribute.

{{quote|It is important to notice that the conditions of relative stability brought about by these or other means, will be far longer duration than the process in which the ornaments are evolved. In most existing species the runaway process must have been already checked, and we should expect that the more extraordinary developments of sexual plumage are not due like most characters to a long and even course of evolutionary progress, but to sudden spurts of change. —''Ronald Fisher, 1930''}}

Since Fisher's initial conceptual model of the 'runaway' process, Russell Lande&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Lande | first1=R. | year=1981 | title=Models of speciation by sexual selection on polygenic traits | url=| journal=PNAS | volume=78 | issue=6| pages=3721–3725 | doi=10.1073/pnas.78.6.3721 | pmid=16593036 | pmc=319643 }} {{cite web |url=http://www.pnas.org/content/78/6/3721 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-06-11 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130612012041/http://www.pnas.org/content/78/6/3721 |archivedate=2013-06-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and Peter O'Donald&lt;ref&gt;O'Donald, Peter (1980). Genetic Models of Sexual Selection. Cambridge University Press, New York, NY. 250 pp.&lt;/ref&gt; have provided detailed mathematical proofs that define the circumstances under which runaway sexual selection can take place.

==Theory==
===Reproductive success===
[[File:Irish Elk front.jpg|thumb|right|Extinct [[Irish elk]] (''Megaloceros giganteus''). These antlers span {{convert|2.7|m|ft}} and have a mass of {{convert|40|kg|lb|0|abbr=on}}.]]

The [[reproductive success]] of an organism is measured by the number of [[offspring]] left behind, and their quality or probable [[fitness (biology)|fitness]].

Sexual preference creates a tendency towards [[assortative mating]] or [[homogamy (biology)|homogamy]]. The general conditions of sexual discrimination appear to be (1) the acceptance of one mate precludes the effective acceptance of alternative mates, and (2) the rejection of an offer is followed by other offers, either certainly, or at such high chance that the risk of non-occurrence is smaller than the chance advantage to be gained by selecting a mate.

The conditions determining which sex becomes the more limited resource in intersexual have been hypothesized with the [[Bateman's principle]], which states that the sex which invests the most in producing offspring becomes a limiting resource over which the other sex competes, illustrated by the greater [[parental investment|nutritional investment]] of an egg in a [[zygote]], and the limited capacity of females to reproduce; for example, in humans, a woman can only give birth every ten months, whereas a male can become a father numerous times.

===Modern interpretation===
[[File:Susa group, mountain gorilla.jpg|thumb|left|Male [[mountain gorilla]], a tournament species]]
The sciences of [[evolutionary psychology]], [[human behavioural ecology]], and [[sociobiology]] study the influence of sexual selection in humans.

Darwin's ideas on sexual selection were met with scepticism by his contemporaries and not considered of great importance in the early 20th century, until in the 1930s biologists decided to include sexual selection as a mode of natural selection.&lt;ref&gt;[[Geoffrey Miller (psychologist)|Miller, Geoffey]], The Mating Mind, p.24&lt;/ref&gt; Only in the 21st century have they become more important in [[biology]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://edge.org/conversation/sexual-selection-and-the-mind Sexual Selection and the Mind] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150610185636/https://edge.org/conversation/sexual-selection-and-the-mind |date=2015-06-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The theory however is generally applicable and analogous to natural selection.&lt;ref name="Hosken2011"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hosken|first1=David J.|last2=House|first2=Clarissa M.|title=Sexual Selection|journal=Current Biology|date=January 2011|doi=10.1016/j.cub.2010.11.053|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960982210015198|volume=21|pages=R62–R65}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Tribolium castaneum87-300.jpg|thumb|Flour beetle]]
[[File:Tungara frog (Physalaemus pustulosus).jpg|thumb|Tungara frog]]

Research in 2015 indicates that sexual selection, including [[mate choice]], "improves population health and protects against extinction, even in the face of genetic stress from high levels of inbreeding" and "ultimately dictates who gets to reproduce their genes into the next generation - so it's a widespread and very powerful evolutionary force." The study involved the [[flour beetle]] over a ten-year period where the only changes were in the intensity of sexual selection.&lt;ref name="popben"/&gt;

Another theory, the [[handicap principle]] of [[Amotz Zahavi]], [[Russell Lande]] and [[W. D. Hamilton]], holds that the fact that the male is able to survive until and through the age of reproduction with such a seemingly maladaptive trait is taken by the female to be a testament to his overall fitness. Such handicaps might prove he is either free of or resistant to [[disease]], or that he possesses more speed or a greater physical strength that is used to combat the troubles brought on by the exaggerated trait. Zahavi's work spurred a re-examination of the field, which has produced an ever-accelerating number of theories. In 1984, Hamilton and [[Marlene Zuk]] introduced the "Bright Male" hypothesis, suggesting that male elaborations might serve as a marker of health, by exaggerating the effects of disease and deficiency. In 1990, Michael Ryan and A.S. Rand, working with the [[tungara frog]], proposed the hypothesis of "Sensory Exploitation", where exaggerated male traits may provide a sensory stimulation that females find hard to resist. Subsequently, the theories of the "Gravity Hypothesis" by Jordi Moya-Larano et al. (2002), invoking a simple biomechanical model to account for the adaptive value for smaller male spiders of speed in clmbing vertical surfaces,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1111/j.1365-2435.2007.01335.x | volume=21 | title=Gravity still matters | year=2007 | journal=Functional Ecology | pages=1178–1181 | last1 = Moya-Laraño | first1 = J.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and "Chase Away" by Brett Holland and William R. Rice have been added. In the late 1970s, Janzen and Mary Willson, noting that male flowers are often larger than female flowers, expanded the field of sexual selection into [[plant]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wilson|first=Mary F|date=June 1979|title=Sexual Selection In Plants|url=|journal=The American Naturalist|volume=113, No. 6|pages=777-790|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the past few years, the field has exploded to include other areas of study, not all of which fit Darwin's definition of sexual selection. These include [[cuckold]]ry, nuptial gifts, [[sperm competition]], [[infanticide]] (especially [[infanticide in primates|in primates]]), physical [[beauty]], mating by subterfuge, species isolation mechanisms, male parental care, ambiparental care, mate location, polygamy, and homosexual rape in certain male animals.

Focusing on the effect of [[sexual conflict]], as hypothesized by William Rice, Locke Rowe et Göran Arnvist, [[Thierry Lodé]] argues that divergence of interest constitutes a key for evolutionary process. Sexual conflict leads to an [[antagonistic co-evolution]] in which one sex tends to control the other, resulting in a tug of war. Besides, ''the sexual propaganda theory'' only argued that mates were opportunistically lead, on the basis of various factors determining the choice such as phenotypic characteristics, apparent vigour of individuals, strength of mate signals, trophic resources, territoriality etc. and could explain the maintenance of genetic diversity within populations.&lt;ref&gt;Thierry Lodé (2006). "La guerre des sexes chez les animaux " Eds Odile Jacob, Paris. {{ISBN|2-7381-1901-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several workers have brought attention to the fact that elaborated characters that ought to be costly in one way or another for their bearers (e.g., the [[tail]]s of some species of [[Xiphophorus]] fish) do not always appear to have a cost in terms of energetics, performance or even survival. One possible explanation for the apparent lack of costs is that "compensatory traits" have evolved in concert with the sexually selected traits.&lt;ref&gt;[http://idea.ucr.edu/documents/flash/sexual_selection_costs/story.htm Sexual Selection Costs &amp; Compensations] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140606234023/http://idea.ucr.edu/documents/flash/sexual_selection_costs/story.htm |date=2014-06-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Toolkit of natural selection===
[[File:Protarchaeopteryx 4713.JPG|thumb|right|''[[Protarchaeopteryx]]'' - skull based on ''[[Incisivosaurus]]'' and wings on ''[[Caudipteryx]]'']]

Sexual selection may explain how certain characteristics (such as feathers) had distinct survival value at an early stage in their evolution. [[Geoffrey Miller (psychologist)|Geoffrey Miller]] proposes that sexual selection might have contributed by creating evolutionary modules such as ''[[Archaeopteryx]]'' feathers as sexual ornaments, at first. The earliest proto-birds such as China's ''[[Protarchaeopteryx]]'', discovered in the early 1990s, had well-developed feathers but no sign of the top/bottom asymmetry that gives wings lift. Some have suggested that the feathers served as insulation, helping females incubate their eggs. But perhaps the feathers served as the kinds of sexual ornaments still common in most bird species, and especially in birds such as peacocks and [[birds-of-paradise]] today. If proto-bird courtship displays combined displays of forelimb feathers with energetic jumps, then the transition from display to aerodynamic functions could have been relatively smooth.&lt;ref name=Miller /&gt;

Sexual selection sometimes generates features that may help cause a species' extinction, as has been suggested&lt;ref name=Miller&gt;Miller, Geoffrey (2000). The Mating Mind.

===Sexual dimorphism===
{{uncited section|date=November 2017}}
{{main article|Sexual dimorphism}}

Sex differences directly related to reproduction and serving no direct purpose in [[courtship]] are called [[primary sexual characteristics]]. Traits amenable to sexual selection, which give an organism an advantage over its rivals (such as in courtship) without being directly involved in [[reproduction]], are called [[secondary sex characteristic]]s.

[[Image:Descent of Man - Figure 16.jpg|thumb|The [[rhinoceros beetle]] is a classic case of [[sexual dimorphism]]. Plate from Darwin's ''[[Descent of Man]]'', male at top, female at bottom]]

In most sexual species the [[males]] and [[females]] have different [[Nash equilibrium|equilibrium]] strategies, due to a difference in relative investment in producing offspring. As formulated in Bateman's principle, females have a greater initial investment in producing offspring ([[pregnancy]] in mammals or the production of the egg in [[birds]] and [[reptiles]]), and this difference in initial investment creates differences in variance in expected reproductive success and bootstraps the sexual selection processes. Classic examples of reversed sex-role species include the [[pipefish]], and [[Wilson's phalarope]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sagebakken|first=Gry|last2=Kvarnemo|first2=Charlotta|last3=Ahnesjö|first3=Ingrid|date=2017-03-22|title=Nutritional state – a survival kit for brooding pipefish fathers|url=https://academic.oup.com/biolinnean/article/121/2/312/3077155|journal=Biological Journal of the Linnean Society|language=en|volume=121|issue=2|pages=312–318|doi=10.1093/biolinnean/blx002|issn=0024-4066}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Also, unlike a female, a male (except in [[monogamous]] species) has some uncertainty about whether or not he is the true parent of a child, and so is less interested in spending his energy helping to raise offspring that may or may not be related to him. As a result of these factors, males are typically more willing to mate than females, and so females are typically the ones doing the choosing (except in cases of [[forced copulation]]s, which can occur in certain species of [[primate]]s, [[duck]]s, and others). The effects of sexual selection are thus held to typically be more pronounced in males than in females.

Differences in secondary sexual characteristics between males and females of a species are referred to as [[sexual dimorphism]]s. These can be as subtle as a size difference (sexual size dimorphism, often abbreviated as SSD) or as extreme as horns and colour patterns. Sexual dimorphisms abound in nature. Examples include the possession of antlers by only male [[deer]], the brighter coloration of many male birds in comparison with females of the same species, or even more distinct differences in basic morphology, such as the drastically increased eye-span of the male [[stalk-eyed fly]]. The [[peacock]], with its elaborate and colourful tail feathers, which the [[peahen]] lacks, is often referred to as perhaps the most extraordinary example of a dimorphism. Male and female [[black-throated blue warbler]]s and [[Guianan cock-of-the-rock]]s also differ radically in their plumage. Early naturalists even believed the females to be a separate species. The largest sexual size dimorphism in [[vertebrates]] is the [[shell dwellers|shell dwelling]] [[cichlid]] [[fish]] ''[[Neolamprologus callipterus]]'' in which males are up to 30 times the size of females&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ota|first=Kazutaka|last2=Kohda|first2=Masanori|last3=Sato|first3=Tetsu|date=2010-05-01|title=Unusual allometry for sexual size dimorphism in a cichlid where males are extremely larger than females|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12038-010-0030-6|journal=Journal of Biosciences|language=en|volume=35|issue=2|pages=257–265|doi=10.1007/s12038-010-0030-6|issn=0250-5991}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Many other fish such as [[guppy|guppies]] also exhibit sexual dimorphism. Extreme sexual size dimorphism, with females larger than males, is quite common in [[spiders]] and [[birds of prey]].

== The Role of Male-Male Competition in Sexual Selection ==
Male-male competition is when two males of the same species compete for the opportunity to mate with a female. [[Sexual dimorphism|Sexually dimorphic]] traits, size, sex ratio &lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Weir|first=Laura K.|date=2012-11-22|title=Male–male competition and alternative male mating tactics influence female behavior and fertility in Japanese medaka (Oryzias latipes)|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs00265-012-1438-9|journal=Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology|language=en|volume=67|issue=2|pages=193–203|doi=10.1007/s00265-012-1438-9|issn=0340-5443}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the social situation &lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=PROCTER|first=D.

There are multiple types of male-male competition that may occur in a population at different times depending on the conditions. Competition variation occurs based on the frequency of various mating behaviours present in the population.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; One factor that can influence the type of competition observed is the population density of males.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; When there is a high density of males present in the population, competition tends to be less aggressive and therefore sneak tactics and disruptions techniques are more often employed.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  These techniques often indicate a type of competition referred to as scramble competition.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In Japanese medaka, ''[[Japanese rice fish|Oryzias latipes]]'', sneaking behaviours refer to when a male interrupts a mating pair during copulation by grasping on to either the male or the female and releasing their own sperm in the hopes of being the one to fertilize the female.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Disruption is a technique which involves one male bumping the male that is copulating with the female away just before his sperm is released and the eggs are fertilized.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

However, all techniques are not equally successful when in competition for reproductive success. Disruption results in a shorter copulation period and can therefore disrupt the fertilization of the eggs by the sperm, which frequently results in lower rates of fertilization and smaller clutch size.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==== Resource Value and Social Ranking ====
Another factor that can influence male-male competition is the value of the resource to competitors. Male-male competition can pose many risks to a male's fitness, such as high energy expenditure, physical injury, lower sperm quality and lost paternity.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nelson-Flower|first=Martha J.|last2=Ridley|first2=Amanda R.|date=2015-09-24|title=Male-male competition is not costly to dominant males in a cooperatively breeding bird|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs00265-015-2011-0|journal=Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology|language=en|volume=69|issue=12|pages=1997–2004|doi=10.1007/s00265-015-2011-0|issn=0340-5443}}&lt;/ref&gt; The risk of competition must therefore be worth the value of the resource. A male is more likely to engage in competition for a resource that improves their reproductive success if the resource value is higher. While male-male competition can occur in the presence or absence of a female, competition occurs more frequently in the presence of a female.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The presence of a female directly increases the resource value of a territory or shelter and so the males are more likely to accept the risk of competition when a female is present.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The smaller males of a species are also more likely to engage in competition with larger males in the presence of a female.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Due to the higher level of risk for subordinate males, they tend to engage in competition less frequently than larger, more dominant males and therefore breed less frequently than dominant males.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; This is seen in many species, such as the Omei treefrog, ''[[Rhacophorus omeimontis]],'' where larger males obtained more mating opportunities and successfully mated with larger mates. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Luo|first=Zhenhua|last2=Li|first2=Chenliang|last3=Wang|first3=Hui|last4=Shen|first4=Hang|last5=Zhao|first5=Mian|last6=Gu|first6=Qi|last7=Liao|first7=Chunlin|last8=Gu|first8=Zhirong|last9=Wu|first9=Hua|date=2016-02-23|title=Male-male competition drives sexual selection and group spawning in the Omei treefrog, Rhacophorus omeimontis|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs00265-016-2078-2|journal=Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology|language=en|volume=70|issue=4|pages=593–605|doi=10.1007/s00265-016-2078-2|issn=0340-5443}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Winner-Loser Effects ====
A third factor that can impact the success of a male in competition is [[Winner and loser effects|winner-loser effects]].&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Zeng|first=Yang|last2=Zhou|first2=Feng-Hao|last3=Zhu|first3=Dao-Hong|date=2018-06-26|title=Fight outcome briefly affects the reproductive fitness of male crickets|url=https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-27866-4|journal=Scientific Reports|language=En|volume=8|issue=1|doi=10.1038/s41598-018-27866-4|issn=2045-2322|pmc=6018733|pmid=29946077}}&lt;/ref&gt; Burrowing crickets, ''velarifictorous aspersus,'' compete for burrows to attract females using their large mandibles for fighting. &lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Female burrowing crickets, are more likely to choose winner of a competition in the 2 hours after the fight.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;  The presence winning male suppresses mating behaviours of the losing males because the winning male tends to produce more frequent and enhanced mating calls in this period of time.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

=== Effect of Male-Male Competition on Female Fitness ===
Male-male competition can both positively and negatively affect female fitness. When there is a high density of males in a population and a large number of males attempting to mate with the female, she is more likely to resist mating attempts, resulting in lower fertilization rates.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; High levels of male-male competition can also result in a reduction in female investment in mating.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Many forms of competition can also cause significant distress for the female negatively impacting her ability to reproduce.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; An increase in male-male competition can affect a females ability to select the best mates, and therefore decrease the likelihood of successful reproduction.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cayuela|first=Hugo|last2=Lengagne|first2=Thierry|last3=Kaufmann|first3=Bernard|last4=Joly|first4=Pierre|last5=Léna|first5=Jean-Paul|date=2016-06-24|title=Larval competition risk shapes male–male competition and mating behavior in an anuran|url=https://academic.oup.com/beheco/article/27/6/1726/2453477|journal=Behavioral Ecology|language=en|volume=27|issue=6|pages=arw100|doi=10.1093/beheco/arw100|issn=1045-2249}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, some techniques can improve the fitness of the female. Group mating can positively affect the fitness of a female in Japanese medaka due to an increase in genetic variation, a higher likelihood of paternal care and a higher likelihood of successful fertilization.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Examples ===
[[File:Narnia_femorata_P1080912a.jpg|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Narnia_femorata_P1080912a.jpg|thumb|A leaf-footed cactus bug, ''Narnia femorata.'']]
In Japanese medaka, females mate daily during mating season.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Males compete for the opportunity to mate with the female by displaying themselves aggressively and chasing each other.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; To obtain the selection of the females, they court the females prior to copulation by performing a courting behaviour referred to as "quick circles".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In [[Coreidae|leaf-footed cactus bugs]], ''Narnia femorata'', males compete for territories where females can lay their eggs.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Males compete more intensely for cacti territories with fruit to attract females. &lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In this species, the males possess sexually dimorphic traits, such as their larger size and hind legs, which are used to gain the most advantage over competitors when females are present, but are not used in the absence of females.

Anuran (such as [[Frog|frogs]]) select habitats (pools) free of conspecifics in order to minimize male-male competition for both themselves and their offspring.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Displays are used in attempt to keep competitors out of their territory and deter sneaking behaviours, while fighting is only used when necessary due to the high costs and risks associated with fighting.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

Today, biologists say that certain evolutionary traits can be explained by [[intraspecific competition]] - competition between members of the same species - distinguishing between competition before or after [[sexual intercourse]].

[[File:Descent of Man fig48.jpg|thumb|upright|Illustration from ''The Descent of Man'' showing the [[tufted coquette]] ''Lophornis ornatus'': female on left, ornamented male on right]]

Before [[sexual intercourse|copulation]], ''intrasexual selection'' - usually between males - may take the form of ''male-to-male combat''. Also, ''intersexual selection'', or ''[[mate choice]]'', occurs when females choose between male mates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1=Campbell | first1=N. A. | author2=J. B. Reece | title=Biology | publisher=Benjamin Cummings | year=2005 | pages=1230 | isbn=0-8053-7146-X }}&lt;/ref&gt; Traits selected by male combat are called secondary sexual characteristics (including horns, antlers, etc.), which Darwin described as "weapons", while traits selected by mate (usually female) choice are called "ornaments". Due to their sometimes greatly exaggerated nature, secondary sexual characteristics can prove to be a hindrance to an animal, thereby lowering its chances of survival. For example, the large antlers of a moose are bulky and heavy and slow the creature's flight from predators; they also can become entangled in low-hanging tree branches and shrubs, and undoubtedly have led to the demise of many individuals. Bright colourations and showy ornamenations, such as those seen in many male birds, in addition to capturing the eyes of females, also attract the attention of predators. Some of these traits also represent energetically costly investments for the animals that bear them.  Because traits held to be due to sexual selection often conflict with the survival fitness of the individual, the question then arises as to why, in nature, in which [[survival of the fittest]] is considered the rule of thumb, such apparent liabilities are allowed to persist. However, one must also consider that intersexual selection can occur with an emphasis on resources that one sex possesses rather than morphological and physiological differences. For example, males of ''[[Euglossa imperialis]]'', a non-social bee species, form aggregations of territories considered to be leks, to defend fragrant-rich primary territories. The purpose of these aggregations is only facultative, since the more suitable fragrant-rich sites there are, the more habitable territories there are to inhabit, giving females of this species a large selection of males with whom to potentially mate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kimsey | first1 = Lynn Siri | year = 1980 | title = The behaviour of male orchid bees (Apidae, Hymenoptera, Insecta) and the question of leks | url = | journal = Animal Behaviour | volume = 28 | issue = 4| pages = 996–1004 | doi=10.1016/s0003-3472(80)80088-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After copulation, male–male competition distinct from conventional [[aggression]] may take the form of [[sperm competition]], as described by [[Geoff Parker|Parker]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Parker | first1=Geoffrey A. | authorlink=Geoff Parker | year=1970 | title=Sperm competition and its evolutionary consequences in the insects | url=| journal=[[Biological Reviews]] | volume=45 | pages=525–567 | doi=10.1111/j.1469-185x.1970.tb01176.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1970. More recently, interest has arisen in [[Female sperm storage|''cryptic'' female choice]],&lt;ref&gt;Eberhard, WG. (1996) ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=A0kcDzAlYy4C&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Female control: Sexual selection by cryptic female choice].'' Princeton, Princeton University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; a phenomenon of internally fertilised animals such as mammals and birds, where a female can get rid of a male's [[sperm]] without his knowledge.

[[File:Darwin sexual caricature.gif|thumb|upright|Victorian cartoonists quickly picked up on Darwin's ideas about display in sexual selection. Here he is fascinated by the apparent [[steatopygia]] in the latest fashion.]]

Finally, [[sexual conflict]] is said to occur between breeding partners,&lt;ref&gt;Locke Rowe, Göran Arnvist. (2013) ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=3g0fAgAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Sexual conflict]'', Princeton Univ Press. {{page needed|date=December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; sometimes leading to an [[evolutionary arms race]] between males and females. Sexual selection can also occur as a product of [[pheromone]] release, such as with the stingless bee, ''[[Trigona corvina]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |title=The Trail Pheromone of a Stingless Bee, Trigona corvina (Hymenoptera, Apidae, Meliponini), Varies between Populations |url=http://chemse.oxfordjournals.org/content/35/7/593 |journal=Chemical Senses |date=2010 |issn=0379-864X |pmid=20534775 |pages=593–601 |volume=35 |issue=7 |doi=10.1093/chemse/bjq057 |first=Stefan |last=Jarau |first2=Jochen |last2=Dambacher |first3=Robert |last3=Twele |first4=Ingrid |last4=Aguilar |first5=Wittko |last5=Francke |first6=Manfred |last6=Ayasse |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160101123601/http://chemse.oxfordjournals.org/content/35/7/593 |archivedate=2016-01-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Female mating preferences are widely recognized as being responsible for the rapid and divergent evolution of male secondary sexual traits.&lt;ref&gt;Andersson M (1994). Sexual Selection. Princeton Univ Press, Princeton, NJ. {{page needed|date=December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Females of many animal species prefer to mate with males with external ornaments - exaggerated features of morphology such as elaborate sex organs. These preferences may arise when an arbitrary female preference for some aspect of male morphology — initially, perhaps, a result of [[genetic drift]] — creates, in due course, selection for males with the appropriate ornament. One interpretation of this is known as the [[sexy son hypothesis]]. Alternatively, genes that enable males to develop impressive ornaments or fighting ability may simply show off greater [[immune system|disease resistance]] or a more efficient [[metabolism]], features that also benefit females. This idea is known as the [[sexy son hypothesis#Good genes theory|good genes hypothesis]].

Bright colors that develop in animals during mating season function to attract partners. It has been suggested that there is a causal link between strength of display of ornaments involved in sexual selection and free radical biology.&lt;ref name="pmid10081154"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=von Schantz T, Bensch S, Grahn M, Hasselquist D, Wittzell H |title=Good genes, oxidative stress and condition-dependent sexual signals |journal=Proc. Biol. Sci. |volume=266 |issue=1414 |pages=1–12 |date=January 1999 |pmid=10081154 |pmc=1689644 |doi=10.1098/rspb.1999.0597 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  To test this idea, experiments were performed on male [[Ctenophorus pictus|painted dragon lizards]].&lt;ref name="pmid22834746"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Olsson M, Tobler M, Healey M, Perrin C, Wilson M |title=A significant component of ageing (DNA damage) is reflected in fading breeding colors: an experimental test using innate antioxidant mimetics in painted dragon lizards |journal=Evolution |volume=66 |issue=8 |pages=2475–83 |date=August 2012 |pmid=22834746 |doi=10.1111/j.1558-5646.2012.01617.x |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Male lizards are brightly conspicuous in their breeding coloration, but their color declines with aging.  Experiments involving administration of [[antioxidant]]s to these males led to the conclusion that breeding coloration is a reflection of innate [[antioxidant|anti-oxidation]] capacity that protects against [[oxidative stress|oxidative damage]], including [[DNA oxidation|oxidative DNA damage]].&lt;ref name="pmid22834746" /&gt;   Thus color could act as a “health certificate” that allows females to visualize the underlying [[oxidative stress]] induced damage in potential mates.

Darwin conjectured that [[Heritability|heritable]] traits such as beards and hairlessness in different human populations are results of [[sexual selection in humans]]. [[Geoffrey Miller (psychologist)|Geoffrey Miller]] has hypothesized that many human behaviours not clearly tied to survival benefits, such as humour, music, visual art, verbal creativity, and some forms of [[altruism]], are courtship adaptations that have been favoured through sexual selection. In that view, many human artefacts could be considered subject to sexual selection as part of the [[extended phenotype]], for instance clothing that enhances sexually selected traits. Some argue that the [[evolution of human intelligence]] is a sexually selected trait, as it would not confer enough fitness in itself relative to its high maintenance costs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.plosone.org/article/fetchArticle.action?articleURI=info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0000062 PLoS ONE: Sexual Selection and the Evolution of Brain Size in Primates] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930013143/http://www.plosone.org/article/fetchArticle.action?articleURI=info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0000062 |date=2007-09-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Buddhism]], a '''sotāpanna''' ([[Pali]]), '''srotāpanna''' ([[Sanskrit]]; {{zh|p=rùliú|t=入流}}, [[Tibetan alphabet|Tibetan]]: རྒྱུན་ཞུགས་, [[Wylie transliteration|Wylie]]: ''rgyun zhugs''&lt;ref&gt;Meditative States in Tibetan Buddhism By Lati Rinpoche, Denma Locho Rinpoche, Leah Zahler, Jeffrey Hopkins. pg 63&lt;/ref&gt;), "stream-winner",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.accesstoinsight.org/glossary.html#sotapanna|title=A Glossary of Pali and Buddhist Terms|publisher=[[Access to Insight]]|accessdate=2010-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; or "stream-entrant"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Snyder|first1=David|title=Definition of a Buddhist|url=http://www.thedhamma.com/definition.htm|website=The Dhamma}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a person who has seen the [[Dharma (Buddhism)|Dharma]] and consequently, has dropped the first three [[Fetter (Buddhism)|fetters]] (''saŋyojana'') that bind a being to rebirth, namely self-view (''sakkāya-ditthi''), clinging to rites and rituals (''sīlabbata-parāmāsa''), and skeptical indecision ([[Vicikitsa]]).

The word ''sotāpanna'' literally means "one who entered (''āpanna'') the stream (''sota'')", after a metaphor which calls the [[Noble Eightfold Path|noble eightfold path]] a stream which leads to [[Nirvana (Buddhism)|nibbāna]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bhikkhu|first1=Thanissaro|title=Intro the Stream: A Study Guide on the First Stage of Awakening|url=http://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/study/into_the_stream.html|website=Access to Insight|quote="Very good, Sariputta! Very good! This noble eightfold path — right view, right resolve, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, right concentration — is the stream."}}&lt;/ref&gt; Entering the stream (''sotāpatti'') is the first of the [[four stages of enlightenment]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Sujato|first1=Bhikkhu|title=A Swift Pair of Messengers|url=http://santipada.org/aswiftpairofmessengers/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/A_Swift_Pair_of_Messengers_Bhikkhu_Sujato.html|website=Santipada}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Attainment==

The first moment of the attainment is termed the path of stream-entry (''sotāpatti-magga''), which cuts through the first three fetters. The person who experiences it is called a stream-winner (''sotāpanna'').&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/authors/khema/allofus.html |title=All of Us|accessdate=2009-03-16|publisher=Access to Insight|last=Sister Ayya Khema}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/authors/bodhi/waytoend.html|title= The Noble Eightfold Path|accessdate=2009-03-16|publisher=Access to Insight|last=Bhikkhu Bodhi}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The sotāpanna is said to attain an intuitive grasp of the dharma,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Tan|first1=Piya|title=Sarakani Sutta 1|url=http://dharmafarer.org/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/3.6-Sarakani-S-1-s55.24-piya.pdf|website=The Dharmafarers|accessdate=25 June 2015|quote=Even these great sal trees,43 Mahanama, if they could understand what is well spoken and what is ill spoken, I would declare them to be streamwinners, no longer bound to the lower world, of fixed destiny, sure of awakening!}}&lt;/ref&gt; this [[Prajñā (Buddhism)|wisdom]] being called [[Noble Eightfold Path#Right view|right view]] (''sammā diṭṭhi'')&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bhikkhu|first1=Thanissaro|title=Maha-cattarisaka Sutta: The Great Forty|url=http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/mn/mn.117.than.html|website=Access to Insight|quote="And what is the right view that is noble, without effluents, transcendent, a factor of the path? The discernment, the faculty of discernment, the strength of discernment, analysis of qualities as a factor for awakening, the path factor of right view[1] in one developing the noble path whose mind is noble, whose mind is without effluents, who is fully possessed of the noble path. This is the right view that is noble, without effluents, transcendent, a factor of the path.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has unshakable confidence in the [[Buddha]], [[Dharma]], and [[Sangha (Buddhism)|Sangha]]. The Buddha, Dharma, and Sangha, sometimes taken to be the [[Three Jewels|triple refuge]], are at other times listed as being objects of recollection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Tan|first1=Piya|title=(Agata,phala) Mahanama Sutta|url=http://dharmafarer.org/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/15.3-Agataphala-Mahanama-S-a6.10-piya.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; In general though, confirmed confidence in the ''Buddha''', ''Dharma'' and ''Sangha'', respectively, is considered to be one of the four limbs of stream-winning (''sotāpannassa angāni'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bhikkhu|first1=Thanissaro|title=Nandiya Sutta: To Nandiya|url=http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/sn/sn55/sn55.040.than.html|quote=There is the case where a disciple of the noble ones is endowed with verified confidence in the Awakened One...Furthermore, the disciple of the noble ones is endowed with verified confidence in the Dhamma...Furthermore, the disciple of the noble ones is endowed with verified confidence in the Sangha...|website=Access to Insight}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Nyanatiloka|first1=Maha Thera|title=Sotapannassa angani|url=http://www.dhammawiki.com/index.php?title=Sotapannassa_angani|website=Dhamma Wiki}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sotapanna is said to have "opened the eye of the Dhamma" (''dhammacakka''), because they have realized that whatever arises will cease (impermanence).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bhikkhu|first1=Thanissaro|title=Upatissa-pasine: Upatissa's (Sariputta's) Question|url=http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/vin/mv/mv.01.23.01-10.than.html|website=Access to Insight|accessdate=25 June 2015|quote=Then to Sariputta the wanderer, as he heard this Dhamma exposition, there arose the dustless, stainless Dhamma eye: "Whatever is subject to origination is all subject to cessation."}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their conviction in the true dharma would be unshakable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Tan|first1=Piya|title=Sarakani Sutta 1|url=http://dharmafarer.org/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/3.6-Sarakani-S-1-s55.24-piya.pdf|website=The Dharmafarers|accessdate=25 June 2015|quote=11 The 4 qualities of a streamwinner: (1) unshakable faith in the Buddha, (2) in the Dharma, and (3) in the Sangha; and (4) moral virtue dear to the saints.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

They have had their first glimpse of the unconditioned element, the ''asankhata'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Nyanatiloka|first1=Maha Thera|title=Manual of Buddhist Terms and Doctrines|url=http://www.dhammawiki.com/index.php?title=Asankhata|website=Dhamma Wiki|accessdate=25 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; in which they see the [[Nirvana (Buddhism)|goal]], in the moment of the fruition of their path (magga-phala). Whereas the stream-entrant has seen nibbāna and, thus has verified confidence in it, the [[Arhat|arahant]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bhikkhu|first1=Thanissaro|title=Sekha Sutta: The Learner|url=http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/sn/sn48/sn48.053.than.html|website=Access to Insight|accessdate=25 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; can drink fully of its waters, so to speak, to use a simile from the Kosambi Sutta (SN 12.68) — of a "well", encountered along a desert road.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bhikkhu|first1=Thanissaro|title=Kosambi Sutta: At Kosambi (On Knowing Dependent Co-arising)|url="My friend, although I have seen properly with right discernment, as it actually is present, that 'The cessation of becoming is Unbinding,' still I am not an arahant whose fermentations are ended. [2] It's as if there were a well along a road in a desert, with neither rope nor water bucket. A man would come along overcome by heat, oppressed by the heat, exhausted, dehydrated, &amp; thirsty. He would look into the well and would have knowledge of 'water,' but he would not dwell touching it with his body. [3] In the same way, although I have seen properly with right discernment, as it actually is present, that 'The cessation of becoming is Unbinding,' still I am not an arahant whose fermentations are ended."|website=Access to Insight}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sotapanna "may state this about himself: 'Hell is ended; animal wombs are ended; the state of the hungry shades is ended; states of deprivation, destitution, the bad bourns are ended! I am a stream-winner, steadfast, never again destined for states of woe, headed for self-awakening!'".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bhikkhu|first1=Thanissaro|title=Vera Sutta: Animosity|url=http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/an/an10/an10.092.than.html|website=Access to Insight}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the remaining three paths, namely: once-return (sakadāgāmin), non-return (anāgāmin), and sainthood (arahatta) become 'destined' (''sammatta niyāma'') for the stream-entrant.  Their enlightenment as a disciple (''ariya-sāvaka'') becomes inevitable within seven lives transmigrating among gods and humans;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Thera|first1=Piyadassi|title=Ratana Sutta|url=http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/kn/snp/snp.2.01.piya.html|website=Access to Insight}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Tan|first1=Piya|title=Velama Sutta|url=http://dharmafarer.org/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/16.6-Velama-S-a9.20-piya.pdf|website=The Dharmafarers|quote=Furthermore, Sariputta, here a certain person fulfills moral virtue, but gains only limited concentration, gains only limited wisdom.20 With the total destruction of the three fetters, he is a seven-at-most,21 having re-arisen and wandered amongst gods and humans for seven lives at the most, makes an end of suffering.22}}&lt;/ref&gt; if they are diligent (''appamatta'', ''appamāda'') in the practice of the Teacher's (''satthāra'') message, they may fully awaken within their present life. They have very little future suffering to undergo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bhikkhu|first1=Thanissaro|title=Nakhasikha Sutta|url=http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/sn/sn13/sn13.001.than.html|website=Access to Insight|accessdate=25 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Pāli Canon|early Buddhist texts]] (e.g. the Ratana Sutta) say that a stream-entrant will no longer be born in the animal womb, or hell realms; nor as a hungry ghost. The pathways to unfortunate rebirth destinations (''duggati'') have been closed to them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bhikkhu|first1=Thanissaro|title=Cakkhu Sutta|url=http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/sn/sn25/sn25.001.than.html|website=Access to Insight|accessdate=25 June 2015|quote=He is incapable of doing any deed by which he might be reborn in hell, in the animal womb, or in the realm of hungry shades. He is incapable of passing away until he has realized the fruit of stream-entry.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Three fetters===
In the [[Pali Canon]], the qualities of a sotāpanna are described as:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/mn/mn.022.than.html|title=Alagaddupama Sutta|accessdate=2009-03-16|publisher=Access to Insight}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|…those monks who have abandoned the three fetters, are all stream-winners, steadfast, never again destined for states of woe, headed for self-awakening. This is how the Dharma well-proclaimed by me is clear, open, evident, stripped of rags.|Alagaddupama Sutta}}

The three fetters which the sotāpanna eradicates are:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/study/stream2.html|title=Stream Entry|accessdate=2009-03-16|publisher=Access to Insight|last=Thanissaro Bhikkhu}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/authors/bodhi/waytoend.html|title=The Noble Eightfold Path|accessdate=2009-03-16|publisher=Access to Insight|last=Thanissaro Bhikkhu}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# '''Self-view''' — The view of substance, or that what is compounded (''sankhata'') could be eternal in the [[Skandha#The five skandhas|five aggregates]] (form, feelings, perception, intentions, cognizance), and thus possessed or owned as [[Ātman (Buddhism)|'I']], 'me', or 'mine'. A sotāpanna doesn't actually have a view about self (''sakkāya-ditthi''), as that doctrine is proclaimed to be a subtle form of clinging.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/mn/mn.011.ntbb.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# '''Clinging to rites and rituals''' - Eradication of the view that one becomes pure simply through performing rituals (animal sacrifices, [[Ritual purification|ablutions]], chanting, etc.) or adhering to rigid [[moralism]] or relying on a god for non-causal delivery (''issara nimmāna''). Rites and rituals now function more to obscure, than to support the right view of the sotāpanna's now opened dharma eye. The sotāpanna realizes that deliverance can be won only through the practice of the [[Noble Eightfold Path]]. It is the elimination of the notion that there are shortcuts to perfecting all virtues.
# '''Skeptical doubt''' - Doubt about the Buddha, his teaching (Dharma), and his community (Sangha) is eradicated because the sotāpanna personally experiences the true nature of reality through insight, and this insight confirms the accuracy of the Buddha’s teaching. Seeing removes doubt, because the sight is a form of vision (''dassana''), that allows one to know (''ñāṇa'').

===Defilements===
According to the Pali Commentary, six types of defilement would be eventually abandoned by a sotāpanna, and no major transgressions:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/authors/nyanaponika/wheel061.html|title=The Simile of the Cloth &amp; The Discourse on Effacement|accessdate=2009-03-16|publisher=Access to Insight|last=Nyanaponika Thera}}&lt;/ref&gt;
#Envy
#Jealousy
#Hypocrisy
#Fraud
#Denigration
#Domineering

===Rebirth===
A sotāpanna will be safe from falling into the states of misery (they will not be born as an animal, [[ghost]], or hell being). Their lust, hatred and delusion will not be strong enough to cause rebirth in the lower realms. A sotāpanna will have to be reborn at most only seven more times in the human or heavenly worlds before attaining nibbāna.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/authors/bodhi/wheel277.html|title=Transcendental Dependent Arising|accessdate=2009-03-16|publisher=Access to Insight|last=Bhikkhu Bodhi}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is not necessary for a sotāpanna to be reborn seven more times before attaining nibbāna, as an ardent practitioner may progress to the higher stages in the same life in which he/she reaches the Sotāpanna level by making an aspiration and persistent effort to reach the final goal of nibbāna.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/authors/gunaratana/wheel351.html|title=The Jhanas|accessdate=2009-03-16|publisher=Access to Insight|last=Henepola Gunaratana}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Buddha, there are three types of sotapannas classifiable according to their possible rebirths:
(1) "If a man, after the disappearance of the 3 fetters (personality-belief, skeptical doubt, attachment to rules and rituals;(samyojana), has entered the stream (to Nibbāna), he is no more subject to rebirth in lower worlds, is firmly established, destined to full enlightenment. After having passed amongst the heavenly and human beings only seven times more through the round of rebirths, he puts an end to suffering. Such a man is called 'one with 7 births at the utmost' (sattakkhattu-parama).
(2) "If a man, after the disappearance of the 3 fetters.... is destined to full enlightenment, he, after having passed among noble families two or three times through the round of rebirths, puts an end to suffering. Such a man is called 'one passing from one noble family to another' (kolankola).
(3) "If a man, after the disappearance of the 3 fetters.... is destined to full enlightenment, he, after having only once more returned to human existence, puts an end to suffering. Such a man is called 'one germinating only once more' (eka-bījī).
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sotapanna|url=http://www.dhammawiki.com/index.php?title=Sotapanna|website=Dhamma Wiki}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Six actions that are not committed===
A sotāpanna will not commit six wrong actions:

#Murdering one's own mother.
#Murdering one's own father.
#Murdering an [[Arahant (Buddhism)|arahant]].
#Maliciously injuring the Buddha to the point of drawing blood.
#Deliberately creating a schism in the monastic community.
#Taking another Teacher [besides Buddha].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Tan|first1=Piya|title=Bahu Dhatuka Sutta|url=http://dharmafarer.org/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/29.1a-Bahudhatuka-S-m115-piya.pdf|website=The Dharmafarers|accessdate=25 June 2015|quote=(4) He understands that it is impossible, there is no chance, that an individual attained to right view, would deprive his mother of life—this is not possible.41 And he understands that it is possible, there is the chance, that an ordinary worldling, would deprive his mother of life—this is possible. (5) He understands that it is impossible, there is no chance, that [65] an individual attained to right view, would deprive his father of life—this is not possible. And he understands that it is possible, there is the chance, that an ordinary worldling, would deprive his father of life—this is possible. (6) He understands that it is impossible, there is no chance, that an individual attained to right view, would deprive an arhat of life—this is not possible. And he understands that it is possible, there is the chance, that an ordinary worldling, would deprive an arhat of life—this is possible. (7) He understands that it is impossible, there is no chance, that an individual attained to right view, would draw the Tathagata’s blood—this is not possible. And he understands that it is possible, there is the chance, that an ordinary worldling, would draw the Tathagata’s blood—this is possible. (8) He understands that it is impossible, there is no chance, that an individual attained to right view, would divide the monastic order [the Sangha]—this is not possible. And he understands that it is possible, there is the chance, that an ordinary worldling, would divide the monastic order—this is possible. (9) He understands that it is impossible, there is no chance, that an individual attained to right view, would proclaim another Teacher—this is not possible.42 And he understands that it is possible, there is the chance, that an ordinary worldling, would declare another Teacher—this is possible.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Textual references==

===Suttas===
The Buddha spoke favorably about the sotapanna on many occasions, and even though it is (only) the first of ''ariya sangha'' members, he or she is welcomed by all other sangha-members for he or she practices for the benefit and welfare of many. In the literature, the ''arya sangha'' is described as "the four" when taken as pairs, and as "the eight" when taken as individual types. This refers to the four supra-mundane fruits (attainments: "phala") and the corresponding four supra-mundane paths (of those practicing to attain those fruits: "magga").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.accesstoinsight.org/ptf/sangha.html|title=Sangha|accessdate=2010-08-22|publisher=Access to Insight}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{quote|"The Sangha of the Blessed One's disciples who have practiced well... who have practiced straight-forwardly... who have practiced methodically... who have practiced masterfully — in other words, the four types [of noble disciples] when taken as pairs, the eight when taken as individual types — they are the Sangha of the Blessed One's disciples: worthy of gifts, worthy of hospitality, worthy of offerings, worthy of respect, the incomparable field of merit for the world."|[[Anguttara Nikaya]], 11.12}}

This is called "the recollection of the Sangha" (''sanghanussati''). It can also be interpreted as, "They are the Blessed One's disciples, who have practiced well, who have practiced directly, who have practiced insight-fully, those who practice with integrity (to share what they have learned with others). They give occasion for incomparable goodness to arise in the world because gifts to them bear great fruit and benefit to the giver.
The fifty-fifth Samyutta of the [[Samyutta Nikaya]] is called the Sotāpatti-saṃyutta, and concerns sotapannas and their attainment. In the discourse-numbers (of that chapter) 1-4, 6-9, 11-14, 16-20, 22-36, 39-49, 51, 53, 54, sotapannas are praised as Sangha members by and to: the sick, lay followers, people on their deathbed, bhikkhunis, bhikkhus, and devas, and end up becoming the well-being and benefit of many.

'''''The Theory of Good and Evil''''' is a 1907 book about [[ethics]] by the English philosopher [[Hastings Rashdall]]. It has been seen as Rashdall's most important philosophical work. Rashdall's work has been compared to that of the philosopher [[G. E. Moore]].

==Summary==
{{expand section|date=November 2018}}
''The Theory of Good and Evil'' is dedicated to the philosophers [[Thomas Hill Green]] and [[Henry Sidgwick]]. In the work, Rashdall discusses ethics. Subjects addressed include [[utilitarianism]], the work of the philosopher [[G. E. Moore]], including ''[[Principia Ethica]]'' (1903), the work of [[F. H. Bradley]], and [[Christian theology]].{{sfn|Rashdall|2004|pages=v–vii}} In his second volume, he deals with potential objections to his views.{{sfn|Rashdall|2004|pages=iii, 1, 83, 287, 311}}

==Publication history==
''The Theory of Good and Evil'' was first published by the [[Clarendon Press]] in 1907. In 2004, it was republished by Elibron Classics.{{sfn|Rashdall|2004|page=ii}}

==Reception==
===Academic journals===
''The Theory of Good and Evil'' was discussed by Daniel Shannon in ''Saint Anselm Journal''. Shannon described the book as Rashdall's best known work, but criticized Rashdall's evaluation of Christian theology.{{sfn|Shannon|2009|pages=1–19}}

===Evaluations in books===
The philosopher [[Richard Wollheim]] described ''The Theory of Good and Evil'' as "a compendious work marred by priggishness" in ''F. H. Bradley'' (1969).{{sfn|Wollheim|1969|page=271}} The philosopher [[John Rawls]] compared Rashdall's ethical views to those of Moore, writing in ''[[A Theory of Justice]]'' (1971) that the position that the capacity for a higher life may be grounds for treating men unequally is implicit in ''Principia Ethica''.{{sfn|Rawls|1999|page=287}} James W. Allard described ''The Theory of Good and Evil'' as Rashdall's most important philosophical work in ''[[The Cambridge Dictionary of Philosophy]]'' (1999).{{sfn|Allard|1999|page=771}} R. S. Downie considered Rashdall's dedication of ''The Theory of Good and Evil'' to Green and Sidgwick appropriate, noting in ''[[The Oxford Companion to Philosophy]]'' (2005) that Rashdall was indebted to both philosophers. He suggested that Rashdall had been "unfairly eclipsed as a moral philosopher" by Moore.{{sfn|Downie|2005|page=782}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3256">'''Touchless knockout''' or '''no-touch knockout''' is a supposed technique by which a person can be [[knockout|rendered unconscious]] solely by application of ''[[qi]]'', ''[[kiai]]'' or similar methods, without making physical contact. This differs from [[pressure point]] techniques which involve light or slight contact to specific areas of the body causing unconsciousness. [[Skepticism|Skeptics]] believe apparent demonstrations of touchless knockout techniques to be [[hypnotism]] of, or acting ([[collusion]]) on the part of, the apparent victims of the technique.

One notable practitioner of the touchless knockout is [[George Dillman]]; he attempted to demonstrate the technique for a [[National Geographic Channel]] program about him and was unable to knock out volunteers previously unknown to him.&lt;ref name="mma.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mixedmartialarts.com/news/435883/No-touch-martial-arts-master-meets-reality/|title=No touch martial arts master meets reality|work=mixedmartialarts.com|accessdate=19 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another martial artist who claimed but was unable to prove an ability to knock out without contact is Harry Thomas "Tom" Cameron, who was featured in episode eight of season one of ''[[Stan Lee's Superhumans]]'' and, unusually for that program, judged not to have any superhuman ability whatsoever. Cameron was also debunked in a [[Fox Network|Fox]] news investigation.&lt;ref name="fightland"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fightland.vice.com/blog/martial-art-pretenders-a-history-of-imitators-and-snake-oil|title=Martial Art Pretenders: A History of Imitators and Snake Oil|work=Fightland|accessdate=19 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="skeptoid"&gt;{{Skeptoid|id=4189|number=189|date=19 January 2010|title=Bullshido: Martial Arts Magic|accessdate=22 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other people who have claimed, but been unable to prove under controlled conditions, an ability to perform a touchless knockout include Yanagi Ryuken of [[Japan]]&lt;ref name="mma.com" /&gt;&lt;ref name="atlantic"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/national/archive/2013/04/what-martial-arts-have-to-do-with-atheism/275273/|title=What Martial Arts Have to Do With Atheism|work=The Atlantic|accessdate=19 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; (sometimes misidentified as Kiai Master Ryukerin);&lt;ref name="skeptoid" /&gt; Jukka Lampila of [[Finland]];&lt;ref name="patheos"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.patheos.com/blogs/friendlyatheist/2013/12/13/after-showing-up-to-his-live-event-skeptics-debunk-promoter-of-touchless-karate/|title=After Showing Up to His Live Event, Skeptics Debunk Promoter of ‘Touchless’ Karate|work=Friendly Atheist|accessdate=19 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and numerous practitioners of the Yellow Bamboo school of martial arts centered on [[Bali]] in [[Indonesia]].&lt;ref name="skepdic"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://skepdic.com/yellowbamboo.html|title=Yellow Bamboo|work=skepdic.com|accessdate=19 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="hoaxes"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hoaxes.org/weblog/comments/the_ancient_art_of_yellow_bamboo|title=The Ancient Art of Yellow Bamboo|work=Museum of Hoaxes|accessdate=19 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13492">'''True-believer syndrome''' is an informal or rhetorical term used by [[M. Lamar Keene]] in his 1976 book ''The Psychic Mafia''. Keene used the term to refer to people who continued to believe in a paranormal event or phenomenon even after it had been proven to have been staged.&lt;ref name=mafia&gt;Keene, Lamar M. (1976). ''The Psychic Mafia''. St. Martin's Press; New York&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=spraggett1&gt;Keene and Spragett, p.151&lt;/ref&gt; Keene considered it to be a [[cognitive disorder]],&lt;ref name=sumer1&gt;{{cite book |author=Davis, W. Sumer |title=Just Smoke and Mirrors: Religion, Fear and Superstition in Our Modern World |isbn=0-595-26523-5 |pages= 11–12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=skepdic&gt;{{cite web |url=http://skepdic.com/truebeliever.html |title=true believer syndrome |accessdate= 2007-08-19 |work=Skeptic's Dictionary}}&lt;/ref&gt; and regarded it as being a key factor in the success of many [[mediumship|psychic mediums]].&lt;ref name=spraggett1/&gt;

The term "true believer" was used earlier by [[Eric Hoffer]] in his 1951 book ''[[The True Believer]]'' to describe the psychological roots of fanatical groups.

==Psychology==
In an article published in [[Skeptical Inquirer]], psychologist Matthew J. Sharps and his colleagues analyze and dissect the psychology of True Believers and their behavior after the predicted apocalypse fails to happen.  Using the [[2012 phenomenon|2012 Mayan apocalypse prophecy]] as example, and citing several other similar cases, Sharps contributes four psychological factors that compel these people to continue their belief (or even stronger belief) despite the conflicted reality.&lt;ref name=sharps&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sharps|first1=Matthew|last2=Liao|first2=Schuyler|last3=Herrera|first3=Megan|title=Remembrance of Apocalypse Past|journal=Skeptical Inquirer|volume=38|issue=6|pages=54–58|year=2014|publisher=CSI|url=http://www.csicop.org/si/show/remembrance_of_apocalypse_past/}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*''Subclinical dissociative tendencies'': While not suffering from mental illness, people with subclinical [[dissociation (psychology)|dissociative]] tendencies have a higher inclination to experience disconnection with immediate physical reality and propensity to see highly improbable things with enhanced credulity.  Such subclinical dissociation is usually associated with [[paranormal]] thinking.&lt;ref name=sharps/&gt;
*''[[Cognitive dissonance]]'': The more one invests in a belief, the more value one will place in this belief and, as a  consequence, be more resistant to facts, evidence or reality that contradict this belief.  Some of the True Believers in the Keech case in the example above had left their spouses, jobs and given up their possessions to prepare to board the alien spacecraft.  When the world did not end, cognitive dissonance-reducing activity ([[Cognitive dissonance#Belief disconfirmation|belief disconfirmation]] response) provided an enhancement of their beliefs and outlet for their heavy investment and discomfort in front of reality.&lt;ref name=festinger/&gt;&lt;ref name=sharps/&gt;
*''[[Gestalt psychology|Gestalt processing]]'': In the continuum in human information processing, people with Gestalt processing will consider a concept without detailed analysis (as opposed to feature-intensive thinking) and accept the idea as a whole relatively uncritically.  Sharps suggests a relationship between dissociative tendencies and gestalt processing.   People who incline to believe paranormal activities will be more likely to credulously entertain the ancient Mayan prophecies whose details most people know little about.&lt;ref name=sharps/&gt;
*''[[Availability heuristic]]'': Under the mental shortcut of availability heuristic, people place more importance and give more weight to a belief when examples related to the idea are more readily recalled, most often because they are recent information and latest news.&lt;ref name="autogenerated3"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tversky|first1=Amos|last2=Kahneman|first2=Daniel|title=Availability: A heuristic for judging frequency and probability|journal=Cognitive Psychology|volume=5|issue=2|year=1973|pages=207–232|issn=0010-0285|doi=10.1016/0010-0285(73)90033-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The information of Mayan prophecies has been abundantly available, especially in the media, before the expected apocalyptic date.  People's judgments tend to bias toward this latest news, particularly those with dissociative tendency toward supernatural and favor gestalt processing.&lt;ref name=sharps/&gt;

==Examples==

===M. Lamar Keene and "Raoul"===
In his book ''The Psychic Mafia'', Keene told of his partner, a [[psychic]] [[mediumship|medium]] named "Raoul" in the book. Some in their congregation still believed that Raoul was genuine even after he openly admitted that he was a fake. Keene wrote "I knew how easy it was to make people believe a lie, but I didn't expect the same people, confronted with the lie, would choose it over the truth. ... No amount of logic can shatter a faith consciously based on a lie."&lt;ref name=mafia/&gt;&lt;ref name=spraggett2&gt;Keene and Spraggett,  pp.141–151&lt;/ref&gt;

===José Alvarez and "Carlos"===
According to ''[[The Skeptic's Dictionary]]'', an example of this syndrome is evidenced by an event in 1988 when stage magician [[James Randi]], at the request of an Australian news program, coached stage performer José Alvarez to pretend he was channelling a two-thousand-year-old spirit named "Carlos". Even after it was revealed to be a fictional character created by Randi and Alvarez, many people continued to believe that "Carlos" was real.&lt;ref name=skepdic/&gt; Randi commented: "no amount of evidence, no matter how good it is or how much there is of it, is ever going to convince the true believer to the contrary."&lt;ref name=abc1&gt;ABC News (1998-10-06) "The Power of Belief: How Our Beliefs Can Impact Our Minds", ABC News (2007-06-04)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Marian Keech and "Clarion"===
In the book ''[[When Prophecy Fails]]'', [[Leon Festinger|Festinger]] and his colleagues observed a fringe group led by "[[When_Prophecy_Fails#Overview|Marian Keech]]" (researchers' [[Pseudonym#Concealing_identity|pseudonym]]) who believed that the world would be destroyed on December 21, 1954 and the true believers would be rescued by aliens on a spaceship to a fictional planet, Clarion.  When nothing happened, the group believed that their devotion convinced God to spare the world and they became even more feverish in [[proselytizing]] their belief.   This is one of the first cases that led Festinger to form the theory of [[cognitive dissonance]].&lt;ref name=festinger&gt;{{cite book | last =Festinger | first =Leon | authorlink =Leon Festinger |author2=Henry W.

{{Atheism sidebar |arguments}}

The '''Ultimate Boeing 747 gambit''' is a counter-argument to modern versions of the &lt;!--[surplus here?: [[William Paley|Paley]]-style --&gt; [[Teleological argument|argument from design]] for the [[existence of God]]. It was introduced by [[Richard Dawkins]] in chapter 4 of his 2006 book ''[[The God Delusion]]'', "Why there almost certainly is no God".

The argument is a play on the notion of a "[[Junkyard tornado|tornado sweeping through a junkyard to assemble a Boeing 747]]" employed to decry [[abiogenesis]] and [[evolution]] as vastly unlikely and better explained by the existence of a [[Creator deity|creator god]]. According to Dawkins, this logic is self-defeating as the [[Theism|theist]] must now account for the god's existence and explain whether or how the god was created. In his view, if the existence of highly complex life on Earth is the equivalent of the implausible junkyard Boeing 747, the existence of a highly complex god is the "ultimate Boeing 747" that truly does require the seemingly impossible to explain its existence.

== Context and history ==
[[File:Richard dawkins lecture.jpg|thumb|upright|The "ultimate Boeing 747 gambit" was originally proposed by [[Richard Dawkins]] in his 2006 book ''[[The God Delusion]]''.]]
Richard Dawkins begins ''The God Delusion'' by making it clear that the God he talks about is the [[Abrahamic]] concept of a [[personal god]] who is susceptible to worship. He considers the existence of such an entity to be a scientific question, because a universe with such a god would be significantly different from a universe without one, and he says that the difference would be [[Empiricism|empirically]] discernible. Therefore, Dawkins concludes, the same kind of reasoning can be applied to the God hypothesis as to any other scientific question.

After discussing some of the most common arguments for the existence of God in chapter 3, Dawkins concludes that the [[argument from design]] is the most convincing. The extreme improbability of life and a universe capable of hosting it requires explanation, but Dawkins considers the God hypothesis inferior to [[evolution by natural selection]] as [[Evolution of biological complexity|an explanation for the complexity of life]]. As part of his efforts to refute [[intelligent design]], he redirects the [[Irreducible complexity|argument from complexity]] in order to show that God must have been designed by a superintelligent designer, then presents his argument for the improbability of God's existence.&lt;ref name="shermer"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Arguing for Atheism |author=Michael Shermer |journal=Science |url=http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/315/5811/463 |volume=315 |issue=5811 |date=2007-01-26 |accessdate=2007-03-15 |doi=10.1126/science.1138989 |pages=463 }} (also available via [http://www.screaming-penguin.com/node/6988 the second review here] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070210162827/http://www.screaming-penguin.com/node/6988 |date=10 February 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dawkins's name for the statistical demonstration that God almost certainly does not exist is the "Ultimate Boeing 747 gambit". This is an allusion to the [[junkyard tornado]]. [[Astrophysics|Astrophysicist]] [[Fred Hoyle]], who was a [[Darwinist]], [[Atheism|atheist]], [[Antitheism|anti-theist]] and advocate of the [[panspermia]] theory of life,&lt;ref group="n"&gt;Collisions of debris as the vehicle for the distribution of biological material across space.&lt;/ref&gt; is reported as having stated that the "probability of life originating on Earth is no greater than the chance that a hurricane, sweeping through a scrapyard, would have the luck to assemble a [[Boeing 747]]."&lt;ref name="tgd113"&gt;''The God Delusion'', p. 113.&lt;/ref&gt; Arguments against empirically based theism date back at least as far as the eighteenth-century philosopher [[David Hume#Design argument|David Hume]], whose objection can be paraphrased as the question "[[Argument from design#Contradictory premises lead to an infinite regress|Who designed the designer?]]". According to philosopher [[Daniel Dennett]], however –&amp;nbsp;one of Dawkins's fellow "[[Brights movement|brights]]"&amp;nbsp;– the innovation in Dawkins's argument is twofold: to show that where design fails to explain complexity, evolution by natural selection succeeds as the only workable solution; and to argue how this should illuminate the confusion surrounding the [[anthropic principle]].&lt;ref group="n"&gt;The notion that "observations of the physical universe must be compatible with [[Consciousness|conscious]] and [[Sapience|sapient]] life that observes it" (see [[Anthropic principle]]).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="dennett"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Review of Richard Dawkins, The God Delusion |author=Daniel Dennett |authorlink=Daniel Dennett |journal=Free Inquiry |volume=27 |issue=1 |date=2006-10-16 |url=http://ase.tufts.edu/cogstud/papers/dawkinsreview.pdf |accessdate=2006-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Dawkins's statement ==
&lt;!--This section heading linked below--&gt;

Dawkins summarizes his argument as follows;&lt;ref&gt;''The God Delusion'', p. 157–8.&lt;/ref&gt; the references to "[[Darwin's Dangerous Idea#Skyhooks and cranes|crane]]" and "[[Darwin's Dangerous Idea#Skyhooks and cranes|skyhook]]" are to notions from Daniel Dennett's book ''[[Darwin's Dangerous Idea]]''.
{{Quotation |
# One of the greatest challenges to the human intellect, over the centuries, has been to explain how the complex, improbable appearance of design in the universe arises.
# The natural temptation is to attribute the appearance of design to actual design itself. In the case of a man-made [[wikt:artefact|artefact&lt;!--UK SPELLING: please don't change (Dawkins is British)--&gt;]] such as a watch, the designer really was an intelligent engineer. It is tempting to apply the same logic to an eye or a wing, a spider or a person.
# The temptation is a false one, because the designer hypothesis immediately raises the larger problem of who designed the designer. The whole problem we started out with was the problem of explaining statistical improbability. It is obviously no solution to postulate something even more improbable. We need a "crane", not a "skyhook"; for only a crane can do the business of working up gradually and plausibly from simplicity to otherwise improbable complexity.
# The most ingenious and powerful crane so far discovered is Darwinian evolution by natural selection. Darwin and his successors have shown how living creatures, with their spectacular statistical improbability and appearance of design, have evolved by slow, gradual degrees from simple beginnings. We can now safely say that the illusion of design in living creatures is just that{{spndash}}an illusion.
# We don't yet have an equivalent crane for physics. Some kind of multiverse theory could in principle do for physics the same explanatory work as Darwinism does for biology. This kind of explanation is superficially less satisfying than the biological version of Darwinism, because it makes heavier demands on luck. But the [[anthropic principle]] entitles us to postulate far more luck than our limited human intuition is comfortable with.
# We should not give up hope of a better crane arising in physics, something as powerful as Darwinism is for biology. But even in the absence of a strongly satisfying crane to match the biological one, the relatively weak cranes we have at present are, when abetted by the anthropic principle, self-evidently better than the self-defeating skyhook hypothesis of an intelligent designer.}}

A central thesis of the argument is that compared to supernatural abiogenesis, evolution by natural selection requires the supposition of fewer hypothetical processes; according to [[Occam's razor]], therefore, it is a better explanation. Dawkins cites a paragraph where [[Richard Swinburne]] agrees that a simpler explanation is better but reasons that theism is simpler because it only invokes a single &lt;!--[is "substance" sic?:]--&gt;substance (God) as a cause and maintainer of every other object. This cause is seen as [[omnipotent]], [[omniscient]] and totally "free". Dawkins argues that an entity that monitors and controls every particle in the universe and listens to all thoughts and prayers cannot be simple. Its existence would require a "mammoth explanation" of its own. The theory of natural selection is much simpler –&amp;nbsp;and thus preferable&amp;nbsp;– than a theory of the existence of such a complex being.&lt;ref&gt;''The God Delusion'', p. 147–149.&lt;/ref&gt;

Dawkins then turns to a discussion of [[Keith Ward]]'s views on [[divine simplicity]] to show the difficulty "the theological mind has in grasping where the complexity of life comes from." Dawkins writes that Ward is sc&lt;!--UK SPELLING (please don't change)--&gt;eptical of [[Arthur Peacocke]]'s ideas that evolution is directed by other forces than only natural selection and that these processes may have a propensity toward increasing complexity. Dawkins says that this sc&lt;!--UK SPELLING (please don't change)--&gt;epticism is justified, because complexity does not come from biased mutations. Dawkins writes:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
[Natural selection], as far as we know, is the only process ultimately capable of generating complexity out of simplicity. The theory of natural selection is genuinely simple. So is the origin from which it starts. That which it explains, on the other hand, is complex almost beyond telling: more complex than anything we can imagine, save a God capable of designing it.&lt;ref name="tgd151"&gt;''The God Delusion'', p. 151.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Assessment and criticism ==

Theist authors have presented extensive opposition, most notably by theologian [[Alister McGrath]] (in ''[[The Dawkins Delusion?]]'') and philosophers [[Alvin Plantinga]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=God Is Great, God Is Good |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rX3tGSzi16AC&amp;pg=PA247#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |accessdate=30 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="plantinga"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.christianitytoday.com/bc/2007/002/1.21.html |title=The Dawkins Confusion — Naturalism ad absurdum |work=Books &amp; Culture, a Christian Review |author=[[Alvin Plantinga]] |year=2007 |accessdate=2007-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--

 --&gt; Another negative review, by biologist [[H. Allen Orr]], sparked heated debate, prompting, for example, the mathematician [[Norman Levitt]] to ask why theologians are assumed to have the exclusive right to write about who "rules" the universe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=What a Friend We Have in Dawkins |author=Norman Levitt |work=eSkeptic |url=http://www.skeptic.com/eskeptic/07-01-31.html |date=2007-01-31 |accessdate=2007-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--

 --&gt; The philosopher Sir [[Anthony Kenny]] also considers this argument to be flawed.&lt;ref&gt;[[Anthony Kenny]], 2007 Presidential [[Royal Institute of Philosophy]] Annual Lecture (published in ''Philosophy'' Volume 82 number 321 (July 2007), pp. 381-397.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--
 --&gt; Cosmologist [[Stephen Barr]]&lt;ref name="Stephen M Barr 2003"&gt;Stephen M Barr (2003), ''Modern Physics and Ancient faith'' ({{ISBN|0-268-03471-0}}).&lt;/ref&gt; responded as follows: "[[William Paley|Paley]] finds a [[Watchmaker analogy|watch and asks how]] such a thing could have come to be there by chance. Dawkins finds an immense automated factory that blindly constructs watches, and feels that he has completely answered Paley's point."&lt;ref&gt;Modern Physics and Ancient Faith Paperback – February 15, 2006 by Stephen M Barr&lt;/ref&gt;

===Simplicity of God and materialist assumptions===
Both Alvin Plantinga and Richard Swinburne raise the objection that God is not complex. Swinburne gives two reasons why a God that controls every particle can be simple: first, a person, as indicated by phenomena such as [[split-brain]]s, is not the same as their highly complex brain but "is something simpler" that can "control" that brain; and second, simplicity is a [[Quality (philosophy)|quality that is intrinsic]] to a hypothesis, not related to its empirical consequences.&lt;ref name="swinburne"/&gt;

Plantinga writes:
{{Quote
 | So first, according to classical theology, God is simple, not complex. More remarkable, perhaps, is that according to Dawkins's own definition of complexity, God is not complex. According to his definition (set out in ''[[The Blind Watchmaker]]''), something is complex if it has parts that are "arranged in a way that is unlikely to have arisen by chance alone." But of course God is a spirit, not a material object at all, and hence has no parts. ''A fortiori'' (as philosophers like to say) God doesn't have parts arranged in ways unlikely to have arisen by chance. Therefore, given the definition of complexity Dawkins himself proposes, God is not complex."
}}
He continues:
{{Quote
 | "But second, suppose we concede, at least for purposes of argument, that God is complex. Perhaps we think the more a being knows, the more complex it is; God, being [[omniscient]], would then be highly complex. Given [[materialism]] and the idea that the ultimate objects in our universe are the elementary particles of physics, perhaps a being that knew a great deal would be improbable{{spndash}}how could those particles get arranged in such a way as to constitute a being with all that knowledge? Of course we aren't given materialism.&lt;ref name="plantinga"/&gt;
}}
In other words, Plantinga concludes that this argument, to be valid, would require materialism to be true; but, as materialism is not compatible with traditional theology,{{clarify|date=November 2014}} the argument [[Begging the question|begs the question]] by requiring its [[premise]] to assume God's non-existence.&lt;ref name="plantinga"/&gt;

In an extensive analysis published in ''[[Science and Christian Belief]]'', Patrick Richmond suggests that "Dawkins is right to object to unexplained organised complexity in God" but that God is simply specified and lacks the sort of composition and limitations found in [physical] creatures; hence the theist can explain why nature exists without granting unexplained organised complexity or the extreme improbability of God.&lt;ref&gt;Patrick Richmond, "Richard Dawkins's Darwinian Objection to Unexplained Complexity in God", ''[[Science and Christian Belief]]'' Vol. 19 No. 2 (2007), pp. 99-106.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some respondents, such as [[Stephen Law]], have suggested that God is or would indeed be complex if responsible [[Creator deity|for creating]] and [[God the Sustainer|sustaining the universe]];&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3fGJq04rUc ''The Strengths and Weaknesses of the God Delusion''] (YouTube).&lt;/ref&gt; God's omniscience would require the retention of and ability to use all knowledge. Concepts such as [[Kolmogorov complexity]] have also been used to argue that God is or would need to be complex.&lt;ref&gt;[http://omnisaffirmatioestnegatio.wordpress.com/2010/06/12/dawkins-and-the-ultimate-747-gambit/ ''Dawkins and the Ultimate Boeing 747 Gambit'']&lt;/ref&gt;

===Necessity of external explanations===
There are many variations on how to express this objection. [[William F. Vallicella]] holds that organized complexity as such does not need explanation, because when in search of an ultimate explanation, one must in the end accept an entity whose complexity has no external explanation.&lt;ref name="vallicella"&gt;[http://maverickphilosopher.powerblogs.com/posts/1167878240.shtml Vallicella's discussion with] [[Erik Wielenberg]].&lt;/ref&gt; Dawkins has stated that we should search for simple beginnings for explanations, like in evolution which moves from simple to complex, and so what we ultimately accept with no external explanation must be simple for it to be a good explanation.&lt;ref name="Dawkins-Lennox"&gt;[http://www.fixed-point.org/index.php/video/35-full-length/164-the-dawkins-lennox-debate The God Delusion Debate: Richard Dawkins vs John Lennox] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110625134059/http://www.fixed-point.org/index.php/video/35-full-length/164-the-dawkins-lennox-debate |date=25 June 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; And Plantinga writes that when ''not'' in search for an ultimate explanation of organized complexity, it is perfectly fine to explain one kind of complexity, that of terrestrial life, in terms of another kind of complexity, namely divine activity.&lt;ref name="plantinga"/&gt; Dawkins addresses this point in his debate with John Lennox over ''The God Delusion'', saying that it would be perfectly reasonable to infer from artifacts on earth or another planet that an intelligence existed, but that you would still need to explain that intelligence, which evolution does, while for God's existence there is no such explanation.&lt;ref name="Dawkins-Lennox"/&gt;

Alister McGrath suggests that the leap from the recognition of complexity to the assertion of improbability is problematic, as a [[theory of everything]] would be more complex than the theories it would replace, yet one would not conclude that it is less probable. Dawkins has responded to this point in his debate with Lennox and at other times, saying that while physics is hard to understand, fundamentally, unlike biology, it is simple.&lt;ref name="Dawkins-Lennox"/&gt; McGrath then argues that probability is not relevant to the question of existence: life on earth is highly improbable and yet we exist. The important question in his view is not whether God is ''probable'', but whether God is ''actual''.&lt;ref&gt;''The Dawkins Delusion?'', pp. 24–25&lt;/ref&gt; In interviewing McGrath for ''The Root of All Evil'', Dawkins responds that the existence of life on Earth is indeed highly improbable, but this is exactly why a theory such as evolution is required to explain that improbability.&lt;ref&gt;[http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=6474278760369344626# Root of All Evil? The Uncut Interviews] (Google Video).&lt;/ref&gt; In the case of God, Dawkins says, there is no such satisfactory explanation.

On the point of probability, Alvin Plantinga claims that if God is a [[Argument from contingency|necessary being]], as argued by classical theism, God is, by definition, maximally probable; thus an argument that there is no necessary being with the qualities attributed to God is required to demonstrate God's improbability.&lt;ref name="plantinga"/&gt; Eric MacDonald has pointed out that theists assume the coherence of their position when they make arguments for God when, by Plantinga's standards, they would have to present an argument that the concept of God is not logically incoherent before discussing other arguments.&lt;ref&gt;[http://choiceindying.com/2011/05/18/duking-it-out-over-the-god-delusion/ ''Duking it Out Over the God Delusion'']&lt;/ref&gt; Plantinga's objection would seem to apply to all atheist arguments that contend that God is improbable, such as evidential arguments about the [[problem of evil]] and the [[argument from nonbelief]]. But the reason why theists and atheists do not usually address this prior to making their arguments is because they want to go beyond merely discussing whether God is maximally probable or impossible.

===Dawkins's response to criticism in ''The God Delusion''===
Dawkins writes about his attendance at a conference in Cambridge sponsored by the [[John Templeton Foundation|Templeton Foundation]],&lt;ref name="tgd151"/&gt; where he challenged the theologians present to respond to the argument that a creator of a complex universe would have to be complex and improbable.&lt;ref&gt;''The God Delusion'', p. 153.&lt;/ref&gt; He reports the strongest response as the claim he was imposing a scientific [[epistemology]] on a question that lies beyond the realm of science. When theologians hold God to be simple, who is a scientist like Dawkins "to dictate to theologians that their God had to be complex?"&lt;ref name="tgd154"&gt;''The God Delusion'', p. 154.&lt;/ref&gt; Dawkins writes that he did not feel that those employing this "evasive" defence were being "wilfully dishonest", but that they were "defining themselves into an epistemological safe-zone where rational argument could not reach them because they had ''declared by fiat'' that it could not."&lt;ref name="tgd154"/&gt;

Theologians, Dawkins writes, demand that there be a [[Cosmological argument|first cause]] named "God". Dawkins responds that it must have been a simple cause and contends that unless "God" is divested of its normal associations, it is not an appropriate name. Postulating a prime mover that is capable of indulging in intelligent design is, in Dawkins's opinion, "a total abdication of the responsibility to find an explanation"; instead, he seeks a "self-bootstrapping crane" ([[#Dawkins's statement|see above]]) that can "lift" the universe into more complex states. This, he states, does not necessitate a {{clarify-span|narrowly scientific|date=November 2014}} explanation, but does require a "crane" rather than a "skyhook" (''[[#Dawkins's statement|ibid.]]'') if it is to account for the complexity of the natural world.&lt;ref name="tgd155"&gt;''The God Delusion'', p. 155.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''white poppy''' is a flower used as a symbol of [[pacifism]], worn either in place of or in addition to the red [[remembrance poppy]] for [[Remembrance Day]] or [[Anzac Day]].

== History ==
In 1926, a few years after the introduction of the red poppy in the UK, the idea of [[pacifist]]s making their own poppies was put forward by a member of the [[No More War Movement]] (as well as the proposal that the black centre of the [[The Royal British Legion|British Legion's]] red poppies should be imprinted with "No More War").&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/nov/04/the-great-poppy-war-how-did-we-get-here|title=The great 'poppy war': how did we get here?|last=Usborne|first=Simon|date=4 November 2016|newspaper=The Guardian|language=en|access-date=19 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their intention was to remember casualties of all wars, with the added meaning of a hope for the end of all wars; the red poppy signified only the [[British military]] dead.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ppu.org.uk/whitepoppy/index.html|title=White Poppies for Peace|website=www.ppu.org.uk|language=en|access-date=19 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, they did not pursue the idea.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The first white poppies were sold by the [[Co-operative Women's Guild]] in 1933&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1502478/British-Legion-reaches-a-truce-with-the-white-poppy-movement.html|title=British Legion reaches a truce with the white poppy movement|last=Iggulden|first=By Amy|work=Telegraph.co.uk|access-date=19 July 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The [[Peace Pledge Union]] (PPU) took part in their distribution from 1936, and white poppy wreaths were laid from 1937 as a pledge to peace that war must not happen again&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/this-britain/the-big-question-why-are-we-asked-to-wear-a-poppy-and-is-its-significance-being-lost-1807573.html|title=The Big Question: Why are we asked to wear a poppy, and is its|work=The Independent|access-date=19 July 2018|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Anti-war organisations such as the [[Anglican Pacifist Fellowship]] now support the White Poppy Movement.

Those who promote the wearing of white poppies argue that the red poppy also conveys a specific political standpoint, and point to the divisive nature of the red poppy in [[Northern Ireland]], where it is worn mainly by [[Unionism in Ireland|unionist]] but boycotted by [[Irish republican]]s.&lt;ref&gt;John Montgomery, quoted in the ''Irish News'', 10 November 1986, p.1&lt;/ref&gt;

Sales of white poppies steadily rose throughout the 2010s, often causing supporters of the PPU to become targets of abuse. On 1 November 2018 sales of white poppies were higher than in any previous year since white poppies were founded in 1933. As of 7 November 2018, 119,555 white poppies had been sold. The final figure was 122,385. The previous record was 110,000 white poppies in 2015. Until 2014, the record was around 80,000 in 1938.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.thenews.coop/133716/sector/community/white-poppies-sales-highest-level-ever/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.ppu.org.uk/news/white-poppy-sales-break-all-records | title=White poppy sales break all records &amp;#124; Peace Pledge Union}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2018, St John Ambulance allowed its volunteers to wear the white poppy for the first time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | url=https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/oct/15/st-john-ambulance-volunteers-white-poppy-red-poppy-remembrance-day | title=St John Ambulance to let volunteers wear white remembrance poppy| newspaper=The Guardian| date=15 October 2018| last1=Correspondent| first1=Robert Booth Social Affairs}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Those who endorse the white poppy campaign include actor [[Mark Rylance]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/history/world-war-two/9772658/Remembrance-Day-poppies-should-be-white.html | title=Remembrance Day poppies should be white| date=31 December 2012| last1=Ross| first1=Tim}}&lt;/ref&gt; poet [[Benjamin Zephaniah]]&lt;ref&gt;https://twitter.com/bzephaniah/status/263218391295336448&lt;/ref&gt; and rapper [[Lowkey]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.facebook.com/Whitepeacepoppy/photos/a.372484435286/10160994200320287/?type=3&amp;theater | title=The White Poppy for Peace Campaign}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Children's author [[Michael Morpurgo]] described his decision to wear a white poppy alongside his red one in a ''Radio Times'' article:
"Wearing the red poppy for me is not simply a ritual, not worn as a politically correct nod towards public expectation. It is in honour of them, in respect and in gratitude for all they did for us. But I wear a white poppy alongside my red one, because I know they fought and so many died for my peace, our peace. And I wear both side by side because I believe the nature of remembrance is changing, and will change, as the decades pass since those two world wars."

=== New Zealand ===
In New Zealand, a ''White Poppy Annual Appeal'' has been run since 2009 by Peace Movement Aotearoa in the week preceding [[Anzac Day]], with all proceeds going to ''White Poppy [[peace studies|Peace Scholarships]]''.&lt;ref name="scoop"&gt;[http://www.scoop.co.nz/stories/CU0904/S00238.htm 2009 White Poppy Annual Appeal] on [[scoop.co.nz]], retrieved 25 April 2009&lt;/ref&gt; The appeal was controversial for some, with Veterans' Affairs Minister Judith Collins claiming the white poppy appeal was "incredibly disrespectful to those who served their country".&lt;ref name="stuff"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/3603373/Rival-poppy-campaign-angers-veterans |title=Rival poppy campaign angers veterans |author=Hank Schouten and Paul Easton |date=21 April 2010 |work=[[The Dominion Post (Wellington)|The Dominion Post]] |accessdate=3 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

White poppies have also been worn in New Zealand to mark [[Remembrance Day]]. In previous years, the annual white poppy appeal was run as a fundraiser for the [[Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament]] around the time of [[Hiroshima Day]] in August. Responsibility for organising the annual appeal was transferred to Peace Movement Aotearoa, as the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament in New Zealand closed down in 2008.&lt;ref name="scoop"/&gt;

The [[Royal British Legion]] has no official opinion on the wearing of white poppies, stating that it "is a matter of choice, the Legion doesn't have a problem whether you wear a red one or a white one, both or none at all".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/this-britain/red-white-or-none-at-all-the-great-poppy-debate-6230165.html|title=Red, white, or none at all?

Some groups such as Northern Irish nationalists though still see the red poppy as primarily remembering the British dead and not those who were victims in wars against the British, hence the belief that the red poppy is a political symbol.&lt;ref&gt; Breen, Paul (2016).

In 1986, [[John Baker (bishop)|John Baker]], Bishop of Salisbury, stated in his diocesan newsletter that he had been asked about the appropriateness of the white poppy. Baker responded "let's not be hurt if we see a white poppy...there is plenty of space for red and white to bloom side by side."&lt;ref name="wh"&gt;{{cite book |first=William |last=Hetherington |title=Swimming Against the Tide: The Peace Pledge Union Story |publisher=The Peace Pledge Union |location=London |year=2009 |isbn=978-0-902680-51-7 |pages=48–49 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Salisbury MP [[Robert Key (politician)|Robert Key]] disagreed, and later that year asked British prime minister [[Margaret Thatcher]] her opinion on the issue.

[[Image:Ernst Haeckel 2.jpg|thumb|170px|right| [[Ernst Haeckel]] wrote about the ''World Riddle'' in 1895]]

The term "'''world riddle'''" or "'''world-riddle'''" has been associated, for over 100 years, with [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] (who mentioned ''Welträthsel'' in several of his writings)
and with the [[biologist]]-[[philosopher]] [[Ernst Haeckel]], who, as a [[professor]] of [[zoology]] at the [[University of Jena]],&lt;ref name=Ha1911&gt;
     "Biography of Ernst Heinrich Haeckel, 1834&amp;ndash;1919" ([[Article (publishing)|article]]),

&lt;/ref&gt;
wrote the book ''Die Welträthsel'' in 1895&amp;ndash;1899, in modern spelling ''Die Welträtsel'' ([[German language|German]] "The World-riddles"), with the English version published under the title ''The Riddle of the Universe'', 1901.&lt;ref name=Ha1911/&gt;

The term "world riddle" concerns the nature of the universe and the [[meaning of life]].

The question and answer of the World Riddle has also been examined as an inspiration or [[allegory|allegorical meaning]] within some musical compositions, such as the unresolved harmonic progression at the end of ''[[Also sprach Zarathustra (Strauss)|Also sprach Zarathustra]]'' (1896) by [[composer]] [[Richard Strauss]], made famous in the film ''[[2001: A Space Odyssey (film)|2001: A Space Odyssey]]''.&lt;ref&gt;

== View of Nietzsche ==
[[Image:FWNietzscheSiebe.jpg|thumb|120px|right| [[Friedrich Nietzsche]].]]

[[Friedrich Nietzsche]] referred to the "World Riddle" (''Welträthsel'') in several of his writings; however, his direct influence was limited to a few years, by his failing health.{{cn|date=June 2015}}

== View of Haeckel ==
[[Ernst Haeckel]] viewed the World Riddle as a dual-question of the form, "What is the nature of the physical universe and what is the nature of human thinking?" which he explained would have a single answer since humans and the universe were contained within one system, a mono-system, as Haeckel wrote in 1895:
&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;
:: [From ''Monism as Connecting Religion and Science'' by Ernst Haeckel (translated):]
:: "The following lecture on [[Monism]] is an informal address delivered extemporaneously on October 9, 1892, at Altenburg, on the seventy-fifth anniversary of the ''"Naturforschende Gesellschaft des Osterlandes."'' ... The "exacting" [[Berlin]] [[physiologist]] shut this knowledge out from his mind, and, with a short-sightedness almost inconceivable, placed this special [[neurological]] question alongside of the one great "'''world-riddle'''," the fundamental question of substance, the general question of the connection between matter and energy.  As I long ago pointed out, these two great questions are not two separate "'''world-riddles'''." The neurological problem of [[consciousness]] is only a special case of the all-comprehending [[cosmology|cosmological]] problem, the question of substance. "If we understood the nature of matter and energy, we should also understand how the substance underlying them can under certain conditions feel, desire, and think." Consciousness, like feeling and willing, among the higher animals is a mechanical work of the [[ganglion|ganglion-cells]], and as such must be carried back to chemical and physical events in the [[plasma (physics)|plasma]] of these.  -Ernst Haeckel, 1895 &lt;ref name=PGmono/&gt;

Haeckel had written that human behavior and feeling could be explained, within the laws of the physical universe, as "mechanical work of the ganglion-cells" as stated.

== View of William James ==
The [[philosopher]] [[William James]] in his book ''[[Pragmatism]]'' (1907) wrote about the world-riddle, as follows:

:: [From ''Pragmatism'' (Lecture VII) by William James:]
:: "All the great single-word answers to the world's riddle, such as God, the One, Reason, Law, Spirit, Matter, Nature, Polarity, the [[Dialectic]] Process, the Idea, the Self, the Oversoul, draw the admiration that men have lavished on them from this oracular role. By amateurs in philosophy and professionals alike, the universe is represented as a queer sort of petrified sphinx whose appeal to man consists in a monotonous challenge to his divining powers. THE Truth: what a perfect idol of the rationalistic mind!"
:::::::::::: --William James, ''Pragmatism'', 1907.&lt;ref name=GutenWJ&gt;
     "The Project Gutenberg EBook of Pragmatism, by William James" (text),
     Project Gutenberg, 2002, Gutenberg.org webpage:
     [http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext04/prgmt10.txt Gutenberg-Pragmatism].
&lt;/ref&gt;

William James has questioned the attitude of thinking that a single answer applies to everything or everyone.  In the passage, the capitalized "THE" signifies the viewpoint meaning "the one and only" [[absolute truth]].

== Emil du Bois-Reymond ==
[[Emil du Bois-Reymond]] used the term "World Riddle" in 1880 for [[Emil_du_Bois-Reymond#The_Seven_World_Riddles|seven great questions]] of science, such as the ultimate nature of matter and the origin of simple sensations. In the lecture to the [[Prussian Academy of Sciences|Berlin Academy of Sciences]] he declared that neither science nor philosophy could ever explain these riddles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=|title=Emil du Bois-Reymond: Neuroscience, Self, and Society in Nineteenth-Century Germany|last=Finkelstein|first=Gabriel Ward|date=2013|publisher=The MIT Press|isbn=9780262019507|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|page=272}}&lt;/ref&gt;[https://archive.org/details/berdiegrenzende07reygoog]
