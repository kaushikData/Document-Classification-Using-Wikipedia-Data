The '''Act for the Government and Protection of Indians''' (Chapter 133, [[California Statutes|Cal. Stats.]], April 22, 1850) was enacted by the first session of the [[California State Legislature]].&lt;ref name=OHP&gt;{{cite web|last1=Dutschke|first1=Dwight|title=A History of American Indians in California |url=http://ohp.parks.ca.gov/pages/1054/files/american%20indians%20in%20california.pdf|website=California Office of Historic Preservation, Five Views: An Ethnic Historic Site Survey for California|date=2014|accessdate=10 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The act "facilitated removing California Indians from their traditional lands, separating at least a generation of children and adults from their families, languages, and cultures (1850 to 1865). This California law provided for "apprenticing" or indenturing Indian children and adults to Whites, and also punished "vagrant" Indians by "hiring" them out to the highest bidder at a public auction if the Indian could not provide sufficient bond or bail."&lt;ref name="Johnston-Dodds"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Johnston-Dodds|first1=Kimberly|title=Early California Laws and Policies Related to California Indians|url=https://www.library.ca.gov/crb/02/14/02-014.pdf|website=50 California Research Bureau, California State Library|accessdate=10 October 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141012063249/https://www.library.ca.gov/crb/02/14/02-014.pdf|archive-date=2014-10-12|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was amended in 1860.&lt;ref name="Johnston-Dodds"/&gt; Although the California legislature repealed parts of the statute after the [[13th Amendment to the United States Constitution]] abolished involuntary servitude,&lt;ref name=OHP/&gt;
it was not repealed in its entirety until 1937.&lt;ref name="Johnston-Dodds"/&gt;

The Act for the Government and Protection of Indians is in line with other laws passed in the state of California during this time, such as the [[Greaser Act]] in 1855 and the [[Foreign Miners' Tax Act of 1850]] (repealed in 1851 and reinstated in 1852). &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.oac.cdlib.org/search?style=oac4;Institution=California%20State%20Library;idT=001482545|title=Foreign Miners Tax documents, 1850-1867.|website=www.oac.cdlib.org|access-date=2017-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://clerk.assembly.ca.gov/sites/clerk.assembly.ca.gov/files/archive/Statutes/1855/1855.PDF#page=229|title=The Statutes of California passed at the Sixth Session of the Legislature|last=|first=|date=1855|website=|access-date=3 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The monolith was carved in the [[Mesoamerican chronology#Postclassic Period|Mesoamerican Postclassic Period]], between [[1250]] and [[1521]] AD. There are no clear indications about the exact year of the size, authorship and purpose of the monolith, although there are certain references to the construction of a huge block of stone by the Mexicas in their last stage of splendor. According to Diego Duran the emperor [[Axayacatl|Axayácatl]] "was also busy in carving the famous and large stone, very carved where the figures of the months and years, days 21 and weeks were sculpted"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.historicas.unam.mx/publicaciones/revistas/nahuatl/pdf/ecn07/ecn07.html|title=Los cinco soles cosmogónicos |last= Moreno de los Arcos |first=Roberto |date=1967 |website= |publisher=Estudios de Cultura Náhuatl |access-date= |quote=También estaba ocupado en labrar la piedra famosa y grande, muy labrada donde estaban esculpidas las figuras de los meses y años, días 21 y semanas}}&lt;/ref&gt;

described in his Monarchy Indiana, how [[Moctezuma Xocoyotzin]] ordered to bring a large rock from Tenanitla, today [[San Ángel|San Angel]], to Tenochtitlan, but on the way it fell on the bridge of the Xoloco neighborhood.&lt;ref name="LopezLujan"/&gt;

The parent rock from which it was extracted comes from the [[Xitle]] volcano, and could be obtained from San Ángel or Xochimilco.&lt;ref name="HistoryinStone"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.inah.gob.mx/images/stories/Multimedia/Interactivos/monolitos/ |title= History in Stone |last= |first= |date= |website= |publisher= |access-date= |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The geologist Ezequiel Ordoñez in 1893 determined such an origin and ruled it as olivine basalt. It was probably dragged by thousands of people from a maximum of 22 kilometers to the center of [[Tenochtitlan|Mexico-Tenochtitlan]].&lt;ref name="HistoryinStone"/&gt;

After the conquest, it was transferred to the exterior of the Templo Mayor, to the west of the then [[National Palace (Mexico)|Palacio Virreinal]] and the Acequia Real, where it remained uncovered, with the relief upwards for many years.&lt;ref name="LopezLujan"/&gt; According to Durán himself, it was during the leadership of [[Alonso de Montúfar]] as archbishop when he ordered to bury the Calendar Stone so that "the memory of the ancient sacrifice that was made there would be lost".&lt;ref name="LopezLujan"/&gt;

Towards the end of the 18th century, the viceroy [[Juan Vicente de Güemes, 2nd Count of Revillagigedo|Juan Vicente de Güemes]] initiated a series of urban reforms in the capital of New Spain. One of them was the construction of new streets and the improvement of certain areas of the city, through the introduction of drains and sidewalks. In the case of the then called Plaza Mayor, sewers were built, the floor was leveled and areas were remodeled. It was [[José Damián Ortiz de Castro]], master of urban works executed, who reported the finding of the Piedra del Sol on December 17, 1790. The monolith was found half a yard from the ground (about 40 centimeters) and 60 meters to the west of the second door of the viceregal palace,&lt;ref name="LopezLujan"/&gt; and removed from the earth with a "real rigging with double pulley".&lt;ref name="LopezLujan"/&gt; [[Antonio de León y Gama]] came to the discovery site to observe and determine the origin and meaning of the monument found.&lt;ref name="LopezLujan"/&gt; According to Chavero,&lt;ref name="Chavero"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://cdigital.dgb.uanl.mx/la/1080028399/1080028399.PDF|title=Calendario Azteca: un ensayo arqueológico |last=Chavero |first=Alfredo |date= 1876 |website= |publisher=Imprenta de Jens y Zapiaine |access-date= |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; it was Antonio who gave it the name of Aztec Calendar, believing it to be an object of public consultation. León y Gama said the following:

{{Quote |... On the occasion of the new paving, the floor of the Plaza being lowered, on December 17 of the same year, 1790, it was discovered only half a yard deep, and at a distance of 80 to the West from the same second door of the Royal Palace, and 37 north of the Portal of Flowers, the second Stone, by the back surface of it.| León y Gama, as cited by Chavero&lt;ref name="Chavero"/&gt;}}

Gama himself interceded before the canon of the Cathedral, José Uribe, in order that the monolith found would not be buried again for his alleged pagan origin, for which almost two centuries before he had been buried.&lt;ref name="SculptureMexica"&gt;Matos Moctezuma, Eduardo. "La Piedra del Sol o Calendario Azteca", in {{cite web |url= |title=Escultura Monumental Mexica |last= Matos Moctezuma|first=Eduardo |date= 2012|website= |publisher=Fondo de Cultura |access-date= |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gama argued that in countries like Italy there was much that was invested in rescuing and publicly showcasing monuments of the past.&lt;ref name="SculptureMexica"/&gt; It is noteworthy that, for the spirit of the time, efforts were made to exhibit the monolith in a public place and also to promote its study.&lt;ref name="SculptureMexica"/&gt; Gama defended in his writings the artistic character of the stone, in competition with arguments of authors like George-Louis Buffón, who gave lesser value to those born in the American continent, including their artistic talent.&lt;ref name="SculptureMexica"/&gt;

The monolith was placed on one side of the west tower of the Metropolitan Cathedral on July 2, 1791. There they observed it, among others, [[Alexander von Humboldt]], who made several studies on his iconography.&lt;ref name="LopezLujan"/&gt; During the [[Mexican–American War]], soldiers of the United States Army who occupied the plaza used the Piedra del Sol for target shooting.&lt;ref name="LopezLujan"/&gt;

In August 1855, the stone was transferred to the Monolith Gallery of the Archaeological Museum on Moneda Street, on the initiative of Dr. Jesús Sánchez, director of the same.&lt;ref name="LopezLujan"/&gt; Through documents from the time, it is known of the popular animosity that caused the "confinement" of a public reference of the city.&lt;ref name="LopezLujan"/&gt;

In 1964 the stone was transferred to the [[National Museum of Anthropology (Mexico)|National Museum of Anthropology and History]], where the stone presides over the Mexica Hall of the museum and is inscribed in various Mexican coins.

Before the discovery of the monolith of [[Tlaltecuhtli]], deity of the earth, with measurements being 4 by 3.57 meters high, it was thought that the Calendar Stone was the largest Mexica monolith in dimensions.&lt;gallery mode="slideshow" widths="60" heights="60"&gt;

== Physical description and iconography  ==
[[File:File-Monolito de la Piedra del Sol (centro).jpg|thumb|right|250px|Detail of the two innermost circles of the monolith]]

The sculpted motifs that cover the surface of the stone refer to central components of the [[Mexica]] [[cosmogony]].

=== Central disk ===
In the center of the monolith is the face of the solar deity, [[Tonatiuh]],&lt;ref&gt;The [[:commons:Image:AntropologyMuseumAztecSoneOfTheSun.jpg|public description by the National Anthropology Museum]] {{Dead link|date=February 2016}} assigns the face to the fire god, [[Xiuhtecuhtli]].&lt;/ref&gt; which appears inside the glyph for "movement" ([[Nahuatl]]: ''Ōllin''), the name of the current era. The central figure is shown holding a human heart in each of his clawed hands, and his tongue is represented by a stone sacrificial knife ([[Tecpatl]]).

=== Four previous suns or eras ===
The four squares that surround the central deity represent the [[five suns|four previous suns]] or eras, which preceded the present era, '''4 Movement''' ([[Nahuatl]]: ''Nahui Ōllin''). The Aztecs changed the order of the suns and introduced a fifth sun named ''4 Movement'' after they seized power over the central highlands.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title= The Aztec Calendar Stone |last1= Villela |first1= Khristaan |publisher= Getty Research Institute |year=2010 |location= Los Angeles |pages= 258 |chapter= The Stone of the Sun |author2= Michel Graulich |isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each era ended with the destruction of the world and humanity, which were then recreated in the next era.
* The top right square represents '''4 Jaguar''' ([[Nahuatl]]: ''Nahui Ōcēlotl''&lt;nowiki/&gt;), the day on which the first era ended, after having lasted 676 years, due to the appearance of monsters that devoured all of humanity.
* The top left square shows '''4 Wind''' ([[Nahuatl]]: ''Nahui Ehēcatl''&lt;nowiki/&gt;), the date on which, after 364 years, hurricane winds destroyed the earth, and humans were turned into monkeys.
* The bottom left square shows '''4 Rain''' ([[Nahuatl]]: ''Nahui Quiyahuitl''&lt;nowiki/&gt;). This era lasted 312 years, before being destroyed by a rain of fire, which transformed humanity into turkeys.
* The bottom right square represents '''4 Water''' ([[Nahuatl]]: ''Nahui Atl''&lt;nowiki/&gt;), an era that lasted 676 years and ended when the world was flooded and all the humans were turned into fish.

The duration of the ages is expressed in years, although they must be observed through the prism of Aztec time. In fact the common thing to figures 676, 364 and 312 is that they are multiples of 52, and 52 years is the duration of 1 Aztec century, and that is why they can express a certain amount of Aztec centuries. Thus, 676 years are 13 Aztec centuries; 364 years are 7, and 312 years are 6 Aztec centuries.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Citation|title=Piedra del Sol|date=2018-10-18|url=https://es.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Piedra_del_Sol&amp;oldid=111372221|work=Wikipedia, la enciclopedia libre|language=es|access-date=2018-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Placed among these four squares are three additional dates, '''1 Flint''' (''Tecpatl''), '''1 Rain''' (''Atl''), and '''7 Monkey''' (''Ozomahtli''), and a '''Xiuhuitzolli''', or ruler's turquoise diadem, glyph. It has been suggested that these dates may have had both historical and cosmic significance, and that the diadem may form part of the name of the Mexica ruler [[Moctezuma II]].&lt;ref&gt;Umberger, Emily. "The Structure of Aztec History". ''Archaeoastronomy'' IV, no. 4 (Oct-Dec 1981): 10–18.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== First ring ===

The first concentric zone or ring contains the signs corresponding to the 20 days of the 18 months and five [[Nēmontēmi|nemontemi]] of the Aztec Calendar. Beginning at the symbol just left of the large point in the previous zone, these symbols are read [[counterclockwise]]. The order is as follows: &lt;blockquote&gt;[[cipactli|1. cipactli]] - crocodile, 2. [[Ehecatl|ehécatl]] - wind, 3. calli - house, 4. cuetzpallin - lizard, 5. cóatl - serpent, 6. miquiztli - skull/death, 7. mázatl - deer, 8. tochtli - rabbit, 9. atl - water, 10. itzcuintli - dog, 11. ozomatli - monkey, 12. malinalli - herb, 13. ácatl - cane, 14. océlotl - jaguar, 15. cuauhtli - eagle, 16. cozcacuauhtli - vulture, 17.

=== Second ring ===
The second concentric zone or ring contains several square sections, with each section containing five points. Directly above these square sections are small arches are said to be feather ornaments. Directly above these are spurs or peaked arches that appear in groups of four.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; There are also eight angles that divide the stone into eight parts, which likely represent the sun's rays placed in the direction of the cardinal points.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Third and outermost ring ===
Two fire serpents take up almost this entire zone. They are characterized by the flames emerging from their bodies, the square shaped segments that make up their bodies, the points that form their tails, and their unusual heads/mouths. At the very bottom of the surface of the stone, are human heads emerging from the serpent's mouths. Scholars have tried to identify these profiles of human heads as deities but have not come to a consensus.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 
[[File:Aztec sun stone JC 03.JPG|left|thumb|Some of the edge region is visible in this photograph.]]
In the upper part of this zone, a square carved between the tails of the snakes represents the date ''Matlactli Omey-Ácatl'' ("13-reed"). This is said to correspond to 1479, the year in which the Fifth Sun emerged in Teotihuacan during the reign of Axayácatl, and at the same time, the year in which this monolith was carved.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Edge of stone ===
The edge of the stone measures approximately 8 inches and contains a band of a series of dots as well as what have been said to be flint knives. This area has been interpreted as representing a starry night sky.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

From the moment the Sun Stone was discovered in 1790, many scholars have worked at making sense of the stone's complexity. This provides a long history of over 200 years of archaeologists, scholars, and historians adding to the interpretation of the stone.&lt;ref name="colonial_latin_america_p23"&gt;K. Mills, W. B. Taylor &amp; S. L. Graham (eds), ''Colonial Latin America: A Documentary History'', 'The Aztec Stone of the Five Eras', p. 23&lt;/ref&gt; Modern research continues to shed light or cast doubt on existing interpretations as discoveries such as further evidence of the stone's pigmentation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Solís|first=Felipe|date=2000|title=La Piedra del Sol|url=|journal=Arqueología Mexicana|volume=VII|issue=41|pages=32–39|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; As Eduardo Matos Montezuma stated in 2004:&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/57716237|title=The Aztec calendar and other solar monuments|last=Eduardo.|first=Matos Moctezuma,|date=2004|publisher=Conaculta-Instituto Nacional de Antropologia e Historia|others=Solís Olguín, Felipe R.|year=|isbn=9680300323|location=México, D.F.|pages=13, 48–59, 68, 70, 72, 74|oclc=57716237}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quote/sandbox|text=“In addition to its tremendous aesthetic value, the Sun Stone abounds in symbolism and elements that continue to inspire researchers to search deeper for the meaning of this singular monument.”|sign=[[Eduardo Matos Moctezuma]]|source=The Aztec Calendar Stone and Other Solar Monuments}}

The earliest interpretations of the stone relate to what early scholars believed was its use for astrology, chronology, or as a sundial. In 1792, two years after the stone's unearthing, Mexican scholar [[Antonio de León y Gama]] wrote one of the first treatises on Mexican archaeology on the Aztec calendar and Coatlicue.&lt;ref&gt;Antonio de León y Gama: ''Descripción histórica y cronológica de las dos piedras'' [http://memory.loc.gov/service/rbc/rbc0001/2006/2006kislak2/2006kislak2.pdf León y Gama]&lt;/ref&gt; He correctly identified that some of the [[glyphs]] on the stone are the glyphs for the days of the month.&lt;ref name="colonial_latin_america_p23" /&gt; [[Alexander von Humboldt]] also wanted to pass on his interpretation in 1803, after reading Leon y Gama's work. He disagreed about the material of the stone but generally agreed with Leon y Gama's interpretation. Both of these men incorrectly believed the stone to have been vertically positioned, but it was not until 1875 that [[Alfredo Chavero]] correctly wrote that the proper position for the stone was horizontal. Roberto Sieck Flandes in 1939 published a monumental study entitled ''How Was the Stone Known as the Aztec Calendar Painted?'' which gave evidence that the stone was indeed pigmented with bright blue, red, green, and yellow colors, just as many other Aztec sculptures have been found to have been as well''.'' This work was later to be expanded by Felipe Solís and other scholars who would re-examine the idea of coloring and create updated digitized images for a better understanding of what the stone might have looked like.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; It was generally established that the four symbols included in the Ollin glyph represent the four past suns that the Mexica believed the earth had passed through.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=State and Cosmos in the Art of Tenochtitlan|last=Townsend|first=Casey|publisher=Dumbarton Oaks|year=1979|isbn=|location=Washington, DC|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another aspect of the stone is its religious significance. One theory is that the face at the center of the stone represents [[Tonatiuh]], the Aztec deity of the sun. It is for this reason that the stone became known as the "Sun Stone." Richard Townsend proposed a different theory, claiming that the figure at the center of the stone represents [[Tlaltecuhtli]], the Mexica earth deity who features in Mexica creation myths.&lt;ref name="colonial_latin_america_p23" /&gt; Modern archaeologists, such as those at the [[Museo Nacional de Antropología|National Anthropology Museum]] in Mexico City, believe it is more likely to have been used primarily as a ceremonial basin or ritual altar for [[Human sacrifice in Aztec culture|gladiatorial sacrifices]], than as an astrological or astronomical reference.&lt;ref name="getty.edu"/&gt;

Yet another characteristic of the stone is its possible geographic significance. The four points may relate to the four corners of the earth or the cardinal points. The inner circles may express space as well as time.&lt;ref&gt;K. Mills, W. B. Taylor &amp; S. L. Graham (eds), ''Colonial Latin America: A Documentary History'', 'The Aztec Stone of the Five Eras', pp. 23, 25&lt;/ref&gt;

Lastly, there is the political aspect of the stone. It may have been intended to show [[Tenochtitlan]] as the center of the world and therefore, as the center of authority.&lt;ref&gt;K. Mills, W. B. Taylor &amp; S. L. Graham (eds), ''Colonial Latin America: A Documentary History'', 'The Aztec Stone of the Five Eras', pp. 25-6&lt;/ref&gt; Townsend argues for this idea, claiming that the small glyphs of additional dates amongst the four previous suns—'''1 Flint''' (''Tecpatl''), '''1 Rain''' (''Atl''), and '''7 Monkey''' (''Ozomahtli'')—represent matters of historical importance to the Mexica state. He posits, for example, that 7 Monkey represents the significant day for the cult of a community within Tenochtitlan. His claim is further supported by the presence of Mexica ruler [[Moctezuma II]]'s name on the work. These elements ground the Stone's iconography in history rather than myth and the legitimacy of the state in the cosmos.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/912811300|title=State and cosmos in the art of Tenochtitlan|last=Townsend|first=Richard Fraser|date=1997-01-01|publisher=Dumbarton Oaks, Trustees for Harvard University|year=|isbn=9780884020837|location=|pages=|oclc=912811300|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Modern use ==
[[File:Aztec calendar on Amate.jpg|thumb|Mexican [[Amate]] paper craft on Aztec calendar stone]]

The calendar stone image is displayed on the obverse the Mexican 20 Peso gold coin, which has a gold content of  {{convert|15|g|ozt|4|abbr=off|lk=out}} and was minted from 1917-1921 and restruck with the date 1959 from the mid 1940s to the late 1970s. Different parts of the calendar are represented on the current Mexican coins, each denomination has a different section.

The calendar stone image also has been adopted by modern Mexican and Mexican American/Chicano culture figures, and is used in folk art and as a symbol of cultural identity.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=aIB86sT9ItwC&amp;pg=PA73&amp;lpg=PA73&amp;dq=%22aztec+calendar+stone%22+%22mexican+culture%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=77ewOoXIwT&amp;sig=SBCVGJTAkfkUYr4B0bwmnq7nlAs&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=tff_TsLFComPigLakvHsDQ&amp;ved=0CFUQ6AEwBw#v=onepage&amp;q=%22aztec%20calendar%20stone%22%20%22mexican%20culture%22&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other calendar stones==
There are several other known monuments and sculptures that bear similar inscriptions. Most of them were found underneath the center of Mexico City, while others are of unknown origin. Many fall under a category known as [[temalacatl]], large stones built for ritual combat and sacrifice. Matos Moctezuma has proposed that the Aztec Calendar Stone might also be one of these.&lt;ref name="Escultura1"&gt;{{cite book|last=Matos Moctezuma|first=Eduardo|title=Escultura monumental mexica|year=2012|publisher=[[Fondo de Cultura Económica]]|location=México|isbn=9786071609328|chapter=La Piedra de Tízoc y la del Antiguo Arzobispado}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:PSM V31 D091 Sacrificial stone or cuauhxicalli of tizoc.jpg|thumb|left|Sacrificial stone or Cuauhxicalli of Tizoc]]
The [[Stone of Tizoc]]'s upward-facing side contains a calendrical depiction similar to that of the subject of this page. Many of the formal elements are the same, although the five glyphs at the corners and center are not present. The tips of the compass here extend to the edge of the sculpture. The Stone of Tizoc is currently located in the [[National Anthropology Museum]] in the same gallery as the Aztec Calendar Stone.

The [[Stone of Motecuhzoma I]] is a massive object approximately 12 feet in diameter and 3 feet high with the 8 pointed compass iconography. The center depicts the sun deity [[Tonatiuh]] with the tongue sticking out.&lt;ref name="Brittany"/&gt;

The [[Philadelphia Museum of Art]] has another, [http://www.philamuseum.org/collections/permanent/51311.html viewable here]. This one is much smaller, but still bears the calendar iconography and is listed in their catalog as "Calendar Stone". The side surface is split into two bands, the lower of which represents Venus with knives for eyes; the upper band has two rows of ''citlallo'' star icons.&lt;ref name="Brittany"/&gt;

A similar object is on display at the [[Yale University Art Gallery]], on loan from the [[Peabody Museum of Natural History]]. This object can be viewed [http://b01.deliver.odai.yale.edu/03/6b/036bd439-4bb3-479d-b746-3a9fe80a3df9/ANT019231-large.jpg here].&lt;ref&gt;Peabody Museum http://collections.peabody.yale.edu/search/Record/YPM-ANT-019231&lt;/ref&gt; The sculpture, officially known as Aztec Calendar Stone in the museum catalog but called ''Altar of the Five Cosmogonic Eras'',&lt;ref name="Brittany"/&gt; bears similar hieroglyphic inscriptions around the central compass motif but is distinct in that it is a rectangular prism instead of cylindrical shape, allowing the artists to add the symbols of the four previous suns at the corners.&lt;ref name="Brittany"/&gt; It bears some similarities to the Coronation Stone of Moctezuma II, listed in the next section.

===Calendar iconography in other objects===
The ''Coronation Stone of [[Moctezuma II|Motecuhzoma II]]'' (also known as the ''Stone of the Five Suns'') is a sculpture measuring 55.9 x 66 x 22.9&amp;nbsp;cm (22 x 26 x 9 in&lt;ref name="AIC"&gt;Art Institute of Chicago https://www.artic.edu/artworks/75644/coronation-stone-of-motecuhzoma-ii-stone-of-the-five-suns&lt;/ref&gt;), currently in the possession of the [[Art Institute of Chicago]]. It bears similar hieroglyphic inscriptions to the Aztec Calendar Stone, with 4-Movement at the center surrounded by 4-Jaguar, 4-Wind, 4-Rain, and 4-Water, all of which represent one of the five suns, or "cosmic eras". The year sign 11-Reed in the lower middle places the creation of this sculpture in 1503, the year of Motecuhzoma II's coronation, while 1-Crocodile, the day in the upper middle, may indicate the day of the ceremony.&lt;ref name="AIC" /&gt; The date glyph 1-Rabbit on the back of the sculpture (not visible in the image to the right) orients Motecuhzoma II in the cosmic cycle because that date represents "the beginning of things in the distant mythological past."&lt;ref name="AIC" /&gt;

The ''Throne of [[Montezuma]]'' uses the same cardinal point iconography&lt;ref name="AncientEU"&gt;https://www.ancient.eu/article/648/throne-of-montezuma/&lt;/ref&gt; as part of a larger whole. The monument is on display at the [[National Museum of Anthropology]] alongside the Aztec Calendar Stone and the Stone of Tizoc. The monument was discovered in 1831 underneath the [[National Palace (Mexico)|National Palace]]&lt;ref&gt;https://mesoamericanonlinemuseum.weebly.com/moctezumas-throne.html&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Mexico City]] and is approximately 1 meter square at the base and 1.23 meters tall.&lt;ref name="AncientEU" /&gt; It is carved in a temple shape, and the year at the top, 2-House, refers to the traditional founding of [[Tenochtitlan]] in 1345 CE.&lt;ref name="AncientEU" /&gt;

The compass motif with ''Ollin'' can be found in stone alters built for the [[New Fire ceremony]].&lt;ref name="Brittany"&gt;Matos Moctezuma, ''The Aztec Calendar and other Solar Monuments''&lt;/ref&gt; Another object, the Ceremonial Seat of Fire which belongs to the [[Santa Cecilia Acatitlan#Museum|Eusebio Davalos Hurtado Museum of Mexica Sculpture]],&lt;ref name="Brittany"/&gt; is visually similar but omits the central ''Ollin'' image in favor of the [[Sun]].

The [[British Museum]] possesses a [[cuauhxicalli]] which may depict the tension between two opposites, the power of the sun (represented by the solar face) and the power of the moon (represented with lunar iconography on the rear of the object). This would be a parallel to the [[Templo Mayor]] with its depictions of [[Huitzilopochtli]] (as one of the two deities of the temple) and the large monument to [[Coyolxauhqui]].&lt;ref name="Brittany"/&gt;

A '''chamber tomb''' is a [[tomb]] for [[burial]] used in many different [[culture]]s. In the case of individual burials, the chamber is thought to signify a higher status for the interree than a simple [[grave (burial)|grave]]. Built from [[Rock (geology)|rock]] or sometimes [[wood]], the chambers could also serve as places for storage of the dead from one family or social group and were often used over long periods for multiple burials. 

Most chamber tombs were constructed from large stones or [[megalith]]s and covered by [[cairn]]s, [[tumulus|barrows]] or earth. Some chamber tombs are [[rock-cut architecture|rock-cut]] [[monument]]s or wooden-chambered tombs covered with [[long barrow|earth barrows]]. [[Grave good]]s are a common characteristic of chamber tomb burials.

In [[Neolithic]] and [[Bronze Age]] [[Europe]], stone-built examples of these burials are known by the generic term of [[megalithic tomb]]s. Chamber tombs are often distinguished by the layout of their chambers and entrances or the shape and material of the structure that covered them, either an earth barrow or stone cairn. A wide variety of local types has been identified, and some designs appear to have influenced others.

A  '''city attorney''' can be an [[election|elected]] or [[wikt:appointment|appointed]] position in [[local government in the United States|city and municipal government]] in the [[United States]]. The city attorney is the [[Attorney at law (United States)|attorney]] representing the city or municipality.

In some small towns, the city attorney is usually a [[lawyer]] in [[Practice of law|private practice]] and handles only governmental matters. In other towns or cities, he or she also prosecutes minor crimes.

A city attorney generally handles all legal matters for the city, from [[traffic ticket]]s to civil [[lawsuit]]s to acting as a [[general counsel]], giving [[legal advice]] for city [[Government agency|departments]].

Areas of focus may include:
*[[Civil law (common law)|Civil]] [[Claim (legal)|claims]] against the city (such as claims against the city [[Law enforcement agency|police department]])
*[[Criminal law|Criminal]] - Prosecute [[misdemeanor]]s and violations ([[Felony|felonies]] are usually prosecuted by a [[district attorney]], [[State's Attorney]] or [[Commonwealth's Attorney]]) 
*[[Real estate]] - Drug/alcohol nuisances, substandard housing or [[code enforcement]]

'''Comics studies''' (also '''comic'''('''s''') '''art studies''', '''sequential art studies'''&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=DQhVAAAAMAAJ&amp;q= ''International Journal of Comic Art'', volume 7], 2005, p. 574.&lt;/ref&gt; or '''graphic narrative studies''')&lt;ref&gt;Pramod K. Nayar, ''The Indian Graphic Novel: Nation, History and Critique'', Routledge, 2016, p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt; is an academic field that focuses on [[comics]] and [[sequential art]].  Although comics and [[graphic novel]]s have been generally dismissed as less relevant [[popular culture|pop culture]] [[Text (literary theory)|texts]], scholars in fields such as [[semiotics]], [[composition studies]] and [[cultural studies]] are now re-considering comics and graphic novels as complex texts deserving of serious scholarly study.

Not to be confused with the technical aspects of comics creation, comics studies exists only with the creation of '''comics theory'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt;—which approaches comics critically as an art—and the writing of '''comics historiography'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt; (the study of the [[history of comics]]).&lt;ref name="Crucifix"&gt;Benoît Crucifix, [https://www.academia.edu/25698596/Redrawing_Comics_into_the_Graphic_Novel._Comics_Historiography_Canonization_and_Authors_Histories_of_the_Medium "Redrawing Comics into the Graphic Novel: Comics Historiography, Canonization, and Authors' Histories of the Medium"], "Whither comics studies?" panel, International conference of the French Association for American Studies, Toulouse (France), May 24–27, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; Comics theory has significant overlap with the '''philosophy of comics'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt;, i.e., the study of the [[ontology]],&lt;ref name="Meskin"&gt;Aaron Meskin, [http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1747-9991.2011.00450.x/abstract;jsessionid=178329FBF825056FF0EF32CB3F3D8263.f03t01?userIsAuthenticated=false&amp;deniedAccessCustomisedMessage= "The Philosophy of Comics"], ''Philosophy Compass'' '''6'''(12), December 2011, pp. 854–864.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Iain Thomson]], in his "Deconstructing the Hero" (in Jeff McLaughlin, ed., ''Comics as Philosophy'' (Jackson: University Press of Mississippi, 2005), pp. 100–129), develops the concept of comics as philosophy.&lt;/ref&gt; [[epistemology]]&lt;ref&gt;Meskin, Aaron and Roy T. Cook (eds.), ''The Art of Comics: A Philosophical Approach'', Wiley-Blackwell, 2012, p. xxxi.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[aesthetics]]&lt;ref&gt;[[David Carrier]], ''The Aesthetics of Comics'', Penn State University Press, 2000, Part 1: "The Nature of Comics."&lt;/ref&gt; of comics, the relationship between comics and other art forms, and the relationship between text and image in comics.&lt;ref name="Meskin"/&gt;

Comics studies is also interrelated with '''comics criticism'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt;, the analysis and evaluation of comics and the comics medium.&lt;ref&gt;Bramlett, Frank, Roy Cook and Aaron Meskin (eds.), ''The Routledge Companion to Comics'', Routledge, 2016, p. 330.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theorizing comics==
Although there has been the occasional investigation of comics as a valid art form, specifically in [[Gilbert Seldes]]' ''The 7 Lively Arts'' (1924), Martin Sheridan's ''Classic Comics and Their Creators'' (1942), and David Kunzle's ''The Early Comic Strip: Narrative Strips and Picture Stories in the European Broadsheet from c. 1450 to 1825'' (1973), contemporary [[English-speaking world|Anglophone]] comics studies in North America can be said to have burst onto the academic scene with both [[Will Eisner]]'s ''[[Comics and Sequential Art]]'' in 1985 and [[Scott McCloud]]'s ''[[Understanding Comics]]'' in 1993. [[Continental philosophy|Continental]] comics studies can trace its roots back to the work of semioticians such as [[Roland Barthes]] (particularly his 1964 essay "Rhetoric of the Image", published in English in the anthology ''Image—Music—Text'')&lt;ref&gt;[[Roland Barthes]], [http://www.persee.fr/doc/comm_0588-8018_1964_num_4_1_1027 "Rhétorique de l'image"], ''Communications'' '''4'''(1), 1964, pp. 40–51, translated as "Rhetoric of the Image", in: Roland Barthes, ''Image–Music–Text'', essays selected and translated by Stephen Heath, New York 1977, pp. 32–51.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Umberto Eco]] (particularly his 1964 book ''Apocalittici e integrati'').&lt;ref&gt;[[Umberto Eco]], ''Apocalittici e integrati: comunicazioni di massa e teorie della cultura di massa'', Bompiani, 1964. Cf. also: Umberto Eco (1972). "Epilogue", in: Walter Herdeg and David Pascal (eds.): ''The Art of the Comic Strip'', Zurich: The Graphis Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

More recently, analysis of comics have begun to be undertaken by cognitive scientists, the most prominent being [[Neil Cohn]], who has used tools from linguistics to detail the theoretical structure of comics' underlying "visual language", and has also used psychological experimentation from cognitive neuroscience to test these theories in actual comprehension. This work has suggested similarities between the way that the brain processes language and the way it processes sequential images.&lt;ref&gt;[[Neil Cohn]], ''The Visual Language of Comics: Introduction to the Structure and Cognition of Sequential Images'', London: Bloomsbury, 2013, p. 1[[wikt:ff.#Abbreviation|ff.]]&lt;/ref&gt; Cohn's theories are not universally accepted with other scholars like [[Thierry Groensteen]], Hannah Miodrag, and Barbara Postema offering alternative understandings.

===Defining comics===
{{quote box
| source = — [[R. C. Harvey]], 2001{{sfn|Harvey|2001|p=76}}
| width = 30em
|"Comics&amp;nbsp;... are sometimes four-legged and sometimes two-legged and sometimes fly and sometimes don't&amp;nbsp;... to employ a metaphor as mixed as the medium itself, defining comics entails cutting a Gordian-knotted enigma wrapped in a mystery&amp;nbsp;..."}}

[[File:Scott McCloud.Making Comics Tour.RISD.gk.JPG|thumb|alt=Photo of a middle-aged man in glasses|Cartoonist and comics theorist [[Scott McCloud]] ]]

Similar to the problems of defining literature and film,{{sfn|Groensteen|2012|pp=128–129}} no consensus has been reached on a definition of the comics medium,{{sfn|Groensteen|2012|p=124}} and attempted definitions and descriptions have fallen prey to numerous exceptions.{{sfn|Groensteen|2012|p=126}}  Theorists such as Töpffer,{{sfn|Thomas|2010|p=158}} [[R.&amp;nbsp;C. Harvey]], [[Will Eisner]],{{sfn|Beaty|2012|p=65}} [[David Carrier]],{{sfn|Groensteen|2012|pp=126, 131}} Alain Rey,{{sfn|Groensteen|2012|p=124}} and Lawrence Grove emphasize the combination of text and images,{{sfn|Grove|2010|pp=17–19}} though there are prominent examples of pantomime comics throughout its history.{{sfn|Groensteen|2012|p=126}}  Other critics, such as Thierry Groensteen{{sfn|Grove|2010|pp=17–19}} and Scott McCloud, have emphasized the primacy of sequences of images.{{sfn|Thomas|2010|pp=157, 170}}  Towards the close of the 20th century, different cultures' discoveries of each other's comics traditions, the rediscovery of forgotten early comics forms, and the rise of new forms made defining comics a more complicated task.{{sfn|Groensteen|2012|p=112–113}}

===Composition studies===
In the field of [[composition studies]], an interest in comics and graphic novels is growing, partially due to the work of comics theorists but also due to composition studies' growing focus on multimodality and [[visual rhetoric]]. Composition studies theorists are looking at comics as sophisticated texts, and sites of complex [[literacy]].

[[Gunther Kress]] defines multimodality as "the use of several semiotic modes in the design of a semiotic product or event, together with the particular way in which these mode are combined"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Kress, Gunther and Theo Van Leeuwen|title=Multimodal Discourse: The Modes and Media of Contemporary Communication|page=20|publisher=Arnold Publishers|year=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; or, more simply as "any text whose meanings are realized through more than one semiotic code".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Kress, Gunther and Theo van Leeuwen|title=Reading Images: The Grammar of Visual Design|edition=2nd|page=177|publisher=Routledge|year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Kristie S. Fleckenstein]] sees the relationship between image and text as "mutually constitutive, mutually infused"—a relationship she names "imageword". Fleckenstein sees "imageword" as offering "a double vision of writing-reading based on [the] fusion of image and word, a double vision of literacy".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Fleckenstein, Kristie|title=Embodied Literacies: Imageword and a Poetics of Teaching|page=2|publisher= Southern Illinois University Press|year= 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Dale Jacobs]] sees the reading of comics as a form of "multimodal literacy or [[multiliteracy]], rather than as a debased form of print literacy".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Jacobs, Dale|title=Marvelling at The Man Called Nova: Comics as Sponsors of Multimodal Literacy|journal=The Journal of the Conference on College Composition and Communication|volume=59 | issue = 2 |page=182}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Jacobs, comics can help educators to move "toward attending to multimodal literacies" that "shift our focus from print only to multiple modalities".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Jacobs, Dale|title=Marvelling at The Man Called Nova: Comics as Sponsors of Multimodal Literacy|journal=The Journal of the Conference on College Composition and Communication|volume=59 | issue = 2 |page=201}}&lt;/ref&gt; He encourages educators to embrace a pedagogy that will give students skills to effectively negotiate these multiple modalities.

===Comics historiography&lt;!--'Comicphilia' redirects here--&gt;===
Comics historiography (the study of the [[history of comics]])&lt;ref name="Crucifix"/&gt; studies the historical process through which comics became an autonomous [[art medium]]&lt;ref&gt;Williams, Paul and James Lyons (eds.), ''The Rise of the American Comics Artist: Creators and Contexts'', University Press of Mississippi, 2010, p. 106.&lt;/ref&gt; and an integral part of culture.&lt;ref&gt;[[Coulton Waugh|Waugh, Coulton]], ''The Comics'', University Press of Mississippi, 1991, p. xiii.&lt;/ref&gt; An area of study is [[premodern]] sequential art; some scholars such as Scott McCloud consider [[Egyptian hieroglyphic]]s and [[Egyptian painting|paintings]] and [[pre-Columbian era|pre-Columbian]] [[Americas|American]] picture manuscripts to be the very first form of comics and sequential art.&lt;ref&gt;[[Scott McCloud]], ''Understanding Comics'', Harper Perennial, 1993, pp. 10–15.&lt;/ref&gt; Another area of study is the 20th-century emergence of the [[subculture]] of comics readers and '''comicphilia'''&lt;ref&gt;Alexandre Linck Vargas, [https://repositorio.ufsc.br/handle/123456789/135497 ''A invenção dos quadrinhos: teoria e crítica da sarjeta''] (''The invention of Comics: Theory and Criticism of Gutters''), Ph.D. thesis, Federal University of Santa Catarina, 2015, Abstract: "we stumble upon the inventions of a comics artistry, from the 1960's&lt;!--sic; apostrophe in the original--&gt; on, through conflicts with the art world (Pop Art, Lowbrow Art and exhibitions), through the emergence of an authorial disposal and of an institutionalized comicphilia..."&lt;/ref&gt; (the passionate interest in comic books).

==Educational institutions==
Comics studies is becoming increasingly more common at academic institutions across the world.

==Scholarly publications==
Since 2000 many new scholarly journals have appeared dedicated to comics studies. Three of the most important peer refereed journals in English are: ''Journal of Graphic Novels and Comics'', ''Studies in Comics'', and ''European Comic Art''. Other notable journals include: ''ImageTexT'' (a [[peer review]]ed, [[open access journal]] that began in the spring of 2004 and is based at the [[University of Florida]]), ''Image and Narrative'' (stylized as ''Image [&amp;] Narrative'', a peer-reviewed [[e-journal]] on [[visual narratology]]), ''SANE: Sequential Art Narrative in Education'' (based at the [[University of Nebraska–Lincoln]]), ''Inks: The Journal of the Comics Studies Society'' (published by the [[Ohio State University Press]]), ''The Comics Grid: Journal of Comics Scholarship'', and the ''[[International Journal of Comic Art]]''.

==Conferences==
Although presentations dedicated to comics are commonplace at conferences in many fields, entire conferences dedicated to this subject are becoming more common. There have been conferences at [[School of the Art Institute of Chicago|SAIC]] (International Comic Arts Forum), [[Manchester Metropolitan University|MMU]] (The International Bande Dessinée Society Conference), [[University of Technology Sydney|UTS]] (Sequential Art Studies Conference), [[Georgetown University|Georgetown]], [[Ohio State University|Ohio State]] (Festival of Cartoon Art),&lt;ref name="Con"&gt;[http://www.comicsresearch.org/academic.html "Regularly Held Conferences"].&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Bowling Green State University|Bowling Green]] (Comics in Popular Culture conference),&lt;ref&gt;Robert G. Weiner (ed.), ''Graphic Novels and Comics in Libraries and Archives: Essays on Readers, Research, History and Cataloging'', McFarland, 2010, p. 264.&lt;/ref&gt; and there is a yearly conference at [[University of Florida]] (Conference on Comics and Graphic Novels).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.english.ufl.edu/comics/conference.shtml |work=www.english.ufl.edu|title=Comics Conference}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, there is an annual [[Michigan State University]] Comics Forum, which brings together academics and professionals working in the industry. Notable regularly held movable conferences include the Comic Art and Comics Area of the Popular Culture Association of America and the conference of the International Society for [[Humor Studies]].&lt;ref name="Con"/&gt;

The International Comics Arts Forum (ICAF), begun in 1995 at Georgetown University by Guy Spielmann and Tristan Fonlladosa, is an annual academic conference distinguished by its international focus and scholarly rigor&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work=internationalcomicartsforum.org|url=http://www.internationalcomicartsforum.org/about-icaf.html|title=The History of ICAF}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The German ''Gesellschaft für Comicforschung'' (ComFor, Society for Comics Studies) has organized yearly academic conferences since 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.comicgesellschaft.de/?page_id=4&amp;lang=en|title=Gesellschaft für Comicforschung|date= |accessdate=2010-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Comics Arts Conference]] has met regularly since 1992 in conjunction with [[San Diego Comic-Con International]] and [[WonderCon]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://comicsforum.org/2014/02/22/the-comics-arts-conference-and-public-humanities-by-kathleen-mcclancy/ ''The Comics Arts Conference and Public Humanities''].&lt;/ref&gt; Another important conference is the annual International Graphic Novels and Comics Conference held since 2010 organized by British academics. This conference has been held in conjunction with the longer running International Bande Dessinée Society conference. ''Comics Forum'', a UK-based community of international comics scholars, also holds an annual conference at [[Leeds Central Library]]; the first was held in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://comicsforum.org/|title=Comics Forum|website=Comics Forum|language=en-US|access-date=2017-02-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2607">'''Defeasibility''' is the property of something – such as a [[contract]], a [[proposition]] or an understanding – that can be [[annul]]led, [[Validity (logic)|invalidated]], or similarly "defeated". In [[law]], it refers to the possibility of a contract or other legal agreement being terminated by circumstances that arise later, or of legal reasoning being overturned. In [[philosophy]] – especially in [[epistemology]], [[ethics]], or the [[philosophy of law]] – it refers to the possibility of a particular principle, rule or understanding being overridden in appropriate circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |title=defeasibility |encyclopedia=The Blackwell Dictionary of Western Philosophy |editor1-last=Bunnin |editor1-first=Nicholas |editor2-first=Jiyuan |editor2-last=Yu |year=2004 |publisher=Blackwell |doi=10.1111/b.9781405106795.2004.x |url=http://www.blackwellreference.com/subscriber/tocnode.html?id=g9781405106795_chunk_g97814051067955_ss1-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[pragmatics]], a subfield of [[linguistics]], it refers to the fact that certain kinds of implicitly conveyed information such as [[conversational implicature]]s and [[presupposition]]s can be "defeated" without sounding contradictory. For example, "[[Flag of Libya#Great Socialist People's Libyan Arab Jamahiriya (1977–2011)|This flag]] is green" normally implicates that it is ''completely'' green; but "[[Flag of Bangladesh|This flag]] is green. It contains a red disc" is no contradiction. Likewise, "John never stopped smoking" normally presupposes that he used to smoke (and still does), but you can say "John never stopped smoking because actually he never did smoke" without contradiction.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | publisher = Cambridge University Press | isbn = 0-521-22235-4 | last = Levinson | first = Stephen C. | title = Pragmatics | location = Cambridge | series = Cambridge Textbooks in Linguistics | year = 1983 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Jean Mignon - The Transformation of Actaeon - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|Print by [[Jean Mignon]], ''The Transformation of Actaeon'', with his pursuit and death shown in the background]] 
The myth of '''Diana and Actaeon''' can be found within Ovid’s ''[[Metamorphoses]]''. The tale recounts the unfortunate fate of a young hunter named [[Actaeon]], who was a grandson of [[Cadmus]], and his encounter with chaste [[Artemis]], known to the Romans as [[Diana (mythology)|Diana]], goddess of the hunt. The latter is nude and enjoying a bath in a spring with help from her escort of nymphs when the mortal man unwittingly stumbles upon the scene. The nymphs scream in surprise and attempt to cover Diana, who, in a fit of embarrassed fury, splashes water upon Actaeon. He is transformed into a deer with a dappled hide and long antlers, robbed of his ability to speak, and thereafter promptly flees in fear. It is not long, however, before his own hounds track him down and kill him, failing to recognize their master.&lt;ref&gt;Ovid. ''Metamorphoses'', translated by A.D. Melville (New York: Oxford University Press, 1986, 2003).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Art==
The story became very popular in the Renaissance. The most common scene shown was Actaeon surprising Diana, but his transformation and his death were also sometimes shown. [[Titian]] painted the first two scenes in two of his greatest late ''poesies'' for [[Philip II of Spain]], in [[Diana and Actaeon (Titian)|''Diana and Actaeon'']] and ''[[The Death of Actaeon]]''.  The latter actually shows the transformation still in progress; like many depictions the head is shown transformed, but most of the body remains human. Less often Actaeon is fully transformed when caught by his dogs.  The story was popular on Italian Renaissance [[maiolica]].

== Ballet == 
The origins of the ''Diana and Actaeon Pas de Deux,'' a ''divertissement'' created for a 1935 version of ''La Esmeralda,'' lie in two earlier ballet productions. The first of these was ''Tsar Kandavl'' (aka ''Le Roi Candaule''), premiered in 1868 by the Imperial Russian Ballet in Saint Petersburg.&lt;ref&gt;Horst Koegler, ''The Concise Oxford Dictionary of Ballet'' (Oxford University Press, 1976).&lt;/ref&gt; Based on a story told by Herodotus in his ''Histories,''&lt;ref&gt;Herodotus, ''The Histories,'' translated by Robin Waterfield (New York: Oxford University Press, 2008).&lt;/ref&gt; this four-act ballet, choreographed by [[Marius Petipa]] to music by [[Cesare Pugni]], included a ''pas de trois'' for dancers portraying Diana, the Roman goddess of the moon, the hunt, and chastity; Endymion, a beautiful shepherd, and a Satyr. This ''divertissement'' told of a poetic encounter in which Diana (or Selene, another name for the moon goddess) looked down upon the sleeping youth, descended to earth, kissed him, and fell in love.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Bulfinch, ''Bulfinch's Mythology: The Age of Fable,'' edited by Norma Lorre Goodrich (New York: Plume Books, 1995).&lt;/ref&gt; In a production mounted in the early twentieth century, Anna Pavlova was among those who danced Diana, and Vaslav Nijinsky appeared as the Satyr.&lt;ref&gt;Bronislava Nijinska, ''Bronislava Nijinska: Early Memoirs'' (New York: Holt, Rinehart, and Winston, 1983).&lt;/ref&gt; In 1917, George Balanchine, then Balanchivadze, also danced the role of the Satyr, with Lydia Ivanova as Diana and Nicholas Efimov as Endymion.&lt;ref&gt;George Balanchine Foundation, "Roles Performed by Balanchine" at Balanchine Catalogue online, http://balanchine.org. Retrieved 5 February 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1886, Petipa incorporated a new ''pas de deux,'' set to music by Riccardo Drigo, into his production of Pugni's ''La Esmeralda'' for the Maryinsky Ballet,&lt;ref&gt;Lincoln Kirstein, "La Esmeralda," in ''Movement and Metaphor: Four Centuries of Ballet'' (New York: Pitman, 1970).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Marius Petipa, ''The Diaries of Marius Petipa,'' translated and edited by Lynn Garafola, "Studies in Dance History," vol. 3.1 (Spring, 1992).&lt;/ref&gt; as the Imperial Russian Ballet had come to be called. This ''pas de deux'' was based on the Greek myth of Artemis (predecessor to the Roman Diana), in her aspect of virgin goddess of the hunt, and Actaeon, a Theban hero. According to Ovid's ''Metamorphoses,'' Actaeon, out on a hunt, stumbled upon Artemis while she was bathing at a spring. Outraged and embarrassed that he had seen her naked, she punished him by destroying his power of speech and turning him into a stag, with antlers and a shaggy coat. In deer form, he was torn to pieces by his own hunting dogs, whipped into a raging fury by Artemis.

In 1935, [[Agrippina Vaganova]] staged a new production of ''La Esmeralda'' for the Kirov Ballet in Leningrad,&lt;ref&gt;Vera Krasovskaya, ''Agrippina Iakovlevna Vaganova'' (Leningrad, 1989).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kirstein, "La Esmeralda" (1970).&lt;/ref&gt; as the company and the city were then known. She created a new, bravura ''pas de deux'' for Diana and Actaeon, joining the names of the modest Roman goddess and the hapless Greek hunter. She included a few spectacular "stag leaps" for the male dancer, but she largely abandoned the well-known story of Actaeon in creating this ''divertissement'' and made instead a rapturous dance for two lovers, set to music by Pugni. Diana is seen as the beautiful goddess of the moon and the hunt, usually wearing a wispy red chiton and carrying a small golden bow; Actaeon is portrayed as a strong, handsome, mortal youth, clad in a short chiton or loincloth. At the premiere, Diana was danced by Galina Ulanova and Actaeon by Vaktang Chabukiani.&lt;ref&gt;"Diana and Actaeon pas de deux," American Ballet Theater website, http://www.abt.org/performanes. Retrieved 5 February 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; Vaganova's popular ''pas de deux,'' which might have been better called ''Diana and Endymion,'' is still performed today as a spectacular showpiece for a ballerina and her partner.

A '''discourse community''' is a group of people who share a set of [[discourse]]s, understood as basic values and assumptions, and ways of communicating about those goals. Linguist John Swales defined discourse communities as "groups that have goals or purposes, and use communication to achieve these goals".&lt;ref&gt;Borg, Erik. [http://eltj.oxfordjournals.org/content/57/4/398.full.pdf+html Discourse communities] (ELT Journal 57:4)&lt;/ref&gt;

Some examples of a discourse community might be those who read and/or contribute to a particular  academic journal, or members of an email list for [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]] fans. Each discourse community has its own unwritten rules about what can be said and how it can be said: for instance, the journal will not accept an article with the claim that "Discourse is the coolest concept"; on the other hand, members of the email list may or may not appreciate a Freudian analysis of Madonna's latest single.  Most people move within and between different discourse communities every day.

Since the discourse community itself is intangible, it is easier to imagine discourse communities in terms of the fora in which they operate.  The hypothetical journal and email list can each be seen as an example of a forum, or a "concrete, local manifestation of the operation of the discourse community".&lt;ref name="porter"&gt;Porter, J. (1992).  Audience and Rhetoric: An Archaeological Composition of the Discourse Community.  New Jersey: Prentice Hall.&lt;/ref&gt;

The term was first used by [[sociolinguist]] Martin Nystrand in 1982,&lt;ref name="nystrand"&gt;Nystrand, M. (1982) ''What Writers Know: The Language, Process, and Structure of Written Discourse.'' New York: Academic&lt;/ref&gt; and further developed by American linguist [[John Swales]].&lt;ref name="swales"&gt;[[John Swales|Swales, J. M.]] (1990) ''Genre Analysis: English in academic and research settings''. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;  Writing about the acquisition of academic writing styles of those who are learning [[English as an additional language]], Swales presents six defining characteristics:

:A discourse community:
:# has a broadly agreed set of common public goals.
:# has mechanisms of intercommunication among its members.
:# uses its participatory mechanisms primarily to provide information and feedback.
:# utilizes and hence possesses one or more genres in the communicative furtherance of its aims.
:# in addition to owning [[genre]]s, it has acquired some specific [[lexis (linguistics)|lexis]].
:# has a threshold level of members with a suitable degree of relevant content and discoursal expertise.

[[James Porter (scholar)|James Porter]] defined the discourse community as: "a local and temporary constraining system, defined by a body of texts (or more generally, practices) that are unified by a common focus.  A discourse community is a textual system with stated and unstated conventions, a vital history, mechanisms for wielding power, institutional hierarchies, vested interests, and so on."&lt;ref name="porter" /&gt;

[[Argumentation theory|Argumentation theorists]] [[Chaim Perelman]] and Lucie Olbrechts-Tyceta offer the following statement on the conditioned nature of all discourse, which has applicability to the concept of discourse community: "All language is the language of community, be this a community bound by biological ties, or by the practice of a common discipline or technique.  The terms used, their meaning, their definition, can only be understood in the context of the habits, ways of thought, methods, external circumstances, and tradition known to the users of those terms.  A deviation from usage requires justification ..."&lt;ref name="Perelman and Olbrechts-Tyceta"&gt;Perelman, Chaim and Lucie Olbrechts-Tyceta (1969) ''The New Rhetoric: A Treatise on Argumentation''. Trans.  John Wilkinson and Purcell Weaver.&lt;/ref&gt;

"Producing text within a discourse community," according to [[Patricia Bizzell]], "cannot take place unless the writer can define her goals in terms of the community's interpretive conventions."&lt;ref name="bizzell"&gt;Bizzell, P. (1992) ''Academic Discourse and Critical Consciousness.'' Pittsburgh: University of Pittsburgh Press.&lt;/ref&gt;  In other words, one cannot simply produce any text—it must fit the standards of the discourse community to which it is appealing.  If one wants to become a member of a certain discourse community, it requires more than learning the lingo.  It requires understanding concepts and expectations set up within that community.

The language used by discourse communities can be described as a [[Register (sociolinguistics)|register]] or diatype, and members generally join a discourse community through training or personal persuasion. This is in contrast to the [[speech community]] (or the 'native discourse community', to use Bizzell's term), who speak a language or [[dialect]] inherited by birth or adoption.

==Designing a discourse community==
[[File:Discourse Community Map.png|thumb|A discourse community map created for fitness|left|502x502px]] 
One tool that is commonly used for designing a discourse community is a map. 
The map could provide the common goals, values, specialized vocabulary and specialized genre of the discourse community.  This tool may be presented to all members as a mission statement. As a new generation of members enter into a discourse community, new interests may appear. What was originally mapped out may be recreated to accommodate any updated interests.&lt;ref&gt;Little, M., C.F.C. Jordens, and E.-J. Sayers. "Discourse Communities And The Discourse Of Experience." Health 7.1 (2003): 73–86. Scopus®. Web. 6 Nov. 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; The way in which a discourse community is designed, ultimately controls the way in which the community functions. A discourse community differs from any other type of grouping because the design will either constrain or enable participants.&lt;ref&gt;Kehus, Marcella, Kelley Walters, and Melanie Shaw. "Definition And Genesis Of An Online Discourse Community." ''International Journal of Learning'' 17.4 (2010): 67–85. ''Education Source''. Web. 30 Oct. 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development of online discourse communities==
A discourse community can be viewed as a social network, built from participants who share some set of communicative purposes.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Kehus, Marcella1, Kelley2 Walters, and Melanie3 Shaw. "Definition And Genesis Of An Online Discourse Community." International Journal of Learning 17.4 (2010): 67–85. Education Source. Web. 30 Oct. 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; In the digital age, social networks can be examined as their own branches of discourse communities. A genesis of online discourse is created through four phases: orientation, experimentation, productivity, and transformation. Just as the digital world is constantly evolving, "discourse communities continually define and redefine themselves through communications among members", according to Berkenkotter.&lt;ref&gt;Berkenkotter, C. (1993, October). A 'rhetoric for naturalistic inquiry' and the question of genre. Research in the Teaching of English, 27, 293–304.&lt;/ref&gt; A community of practice requires a group of people negotiating work and working toward a common goal using shared or common resources.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt; These virtual discourse communities consist of a group of people brought together "by natural will and a set of shared ideas and ideals".&lt;ref&gt;Kowch, E., &amp; Schwier. (1997, February 21). Building learning communities with technology. Presented at the National Congress on Rural Education. Saskatchewan, Canada.&lt;/ref&gt; The virtual discourse communities become a separate entity from any other discourse community when, "enough people carry on those public relationships long enough to form webs of personal relationships in cyberspace".&lt;ref&gt;Rheingold, H. (1993). The virtual community: Homesteading on the electronic frontier. Reading, MA: Addison-Wesley.&lt;/ref&gt;

"The term discourse community has been criticized in being imprecise and inaccurate, by emphasizing the uniformity, symmetrical relations and cooperation within text circulation networks."&lt;ref&gt;C, B., &amp; P, P. (2005). Issue Brief: Discourse Communities. Retrieved November 15, 2015, from http://www.ncte.org/college/briefs/dc&lt;/ref&gt; Social collectivities within a discourse community can be interpreted as controversial whether by design or mistake. Members of the discourse community take on either assigned or maintained roles which serve as discursive authority, rights, expectations and constraints. Within an online discourse community text oftentimes circulate in what can be considered to be heterogeneous groupings, as teachers write to audiences of administrators, scholars, colleagues, parents and students. The circulation of texts form groups of communities that might not otherwise existed prior to being untied by the circulation of documents. "These and other social complexities suggest a more subtle and varied sociological vocabulary is needed to describe the set of relations within text circulation networks as well as to describe the ways genres mediate the actions and relations within these social collectivities, such as that provided by sociocultural theories of genre and activity."&lt;ref&gt;Bazerman, C. (2009, November 22). Issue Brief: Discourse Communities. Retrieved November 13, 2015, from http://www.ncte.org/college/briefs/dc&lt;/ref&gt;

==Culture==

Discourse communities are not limited to involvement of people from different linguistic and cultural backgrounds. These people begin to adapt to standards of that discourse community. However, involvement in one discourse community does not hinder participation in other groups based on a pursuit of a common goal. In some cases, under specific standards, traces of discourse interference may appear from other standards.&lt;ref&gt;Duszak, A. (1997). Culture and styles of academic discourse. Berlin: Mouton de Gruyter.&lt;/ref&gt;

Yerrick and Gilbert discuss the impact of discourse perpetuates [[marginalization]] of underrepresented students.  Their study discuss their frustration of the overwhelming number of school policies and practices creating obstacles for certain students voices to be heard.
Therefore, minimizing lower-track students' input shaping mainstream academic curriculum. These students are given few opportunities to contribute in the classroom and when they did, they would only be permitted to echo someone else's voice on particular views and opinions. With resentment, Yerrick and Gilbert state "There was no attempt to match the home-based discourse with the academic discourse promoted in the classroom, as has been proven problematic through other studies as well."&lt;ref&gt;Yerrick, R. K., &amp; Gilbert, A. (2011). Constraining the discourse community: How science discourse perpetuates marginalization of underrepresented students. Journal of Multicultural Discourses, 6(1), 67–91. {{doi|10.1080/17447143.2010.510909}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Related terms==
Discourse communities are studied in the larger field of [[genre analysis]]. Related terms include Miller's "rhetorical community"&lt;ref&gt;Miller, Carolyn R. "Rhetorical community: The cultural basis of genre." Genre and the new rhetoric (1994): 67–78.&lt;/ref&gt; and, focusing on the communication rather than the community, Yates &amp; Orlikowski's "genres of organizational communication"&lt;ref&gt;[[JoAnne Yates]] and [[Wanda Orlikowski|Wanda J. Orlikowski]]. "Genres of organizational communication: A structurational approach to studying communication and media." [[Academy of Management Review]] 17.2 (1992): 299–326.&lt;/ref&gt;

James Paul Gee uses discourse as a way of "(writing)-doing-being-valuing-believing combinations" (Gee 142). Discourse can be connected to the concept of audience in that both the audience and the writer partake in a series of historical contingencies that place the writer and audience into a larger conversation with one another. It is an "identity kit" of sorts: "A Discourse is a sort of 'identity kit' which comes complete with the appropriate costume and instructions on how to act, talk, and often write, so as to take on a particular social role that others will recognize. Imagine what an identity kit to play the role of Sherlock Holmes would involve: certain clothes, certain ways of using language (oral language and print), certain attitudes and beliefs, allegiance to a certain life style, and certain ways of interacting with others. We can call all these factors together, as they are integrated around the identity of 'Sherlock Holmes, Master Detective' the 'Sherlock Holmes Discourse'. This example also makes clear that 'Discourse', as I am using the term, does not involve just talk or just language. (Gee 142) Furthermore, discourses are not individualistic, but rather community-based, in official (institutional frameworks) capacities, unofficial (social groups) capacities, or both. Specifically, "Discourses are always embedded in a medley of social institutions, and often involve various 'props' like books and magazines of various sorts, laboratories, classrooms, buildings of various sorts, various technologies, and a myriad of other objects from sewing needles (for sewing circles) through birds (for bird watchers) to basketball courts and basketballs (for basketball players)" (143).

Regarding contemporary rhetorical communities, Zappen, et al., states, "Thus a contemporary rhetorical community is less a collection of people joined by shared beliefs and values than a public space or forum that permits these people to engage each other and form limited or local communities of belief."&lt;ref&gt;Zappen, James P., Laura J. Gurak, and Stephen Doheny-Farina. "Rhetoric, Community, and Cyberspace." Rhetoric Review 1997: 400. JSTOR Journals. Web. 10 Oct. 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; Incorporating this factor suggests an introduction to a democratic system in discourse communities and has also been educationally termed "Accountable Talk" by researchers,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ardasheva|first1=Yuliya|last2=Howell|first2=Penny B.|last3=Magaña Margarita|first3=Vidrio|title=Accessing the Classroom Discourse Community Through Accountable Talk: English Learners' Voices|journal=TESOL Journal/TESOL Quarterly|date=September 2016|volume=7|issue=3|pages=667–99|doi=10.1002/tesj.237|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/browse/publications?type=journal|accessdate=18 January 2017|publisher=Wiley|language=English|issn=1949-3533}}&lt;/ref&gt; indicating the diversity of communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Vadacs|first1=Bea|title=Banal Nationalism, Football, and Discourse Community in Africa|journal=Studies in Ethnicity and Nationalism|date=April 2011|volume=11|issue=1|pages=25–41|doi=10.1111/j.1754-9469.2011.01105.x|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/browse/publications?type=journal|accessdate=18 January 2017|publisher=Wiley Journals|location=US|language=English|format=Print/web}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Easy Riders, Raging Bulls: How the Sex-Drugs-and-Rock 'N Roll Generation Saved Hollywood''''' is a book written by [[Peter Biskind]] and published by [[Simon &amp; Schuster]] in 1998. ''Easy Riders, Raging Bulls'' is about the [[New Hollywood|1970s Hollywood]], a period of American film known for the production of such films such as ''[[The Godfather]],'' ''[[The Godfather Part II]],'' ''[[Chinatown (1974 film)|Chinatown]],'' ''[[Taxi Driver]],'' ''[[Jaws (film)|Jaws]],'' ''[[Star Wars (film)|Star Wars]],'' ''[[The Exorcist (film)|The Exorcist]],'' and ''[[The Last Picture Show]]''. The title is taken from films which bookend the era: ''[[Easy Rider]]'' (1969) and ''[[Raging Bull]]'' (1980). The book follows Hollywood on the brink of the [[Vietnam War]], when a group of young Hollywood film directors known as the "movie brats" are making their names. It begins in the 1960s and ends in the 1980s.

The book was the basis of a 2003 documentary film of the same name directed by Kenneth Bowser and narrated by actor [[William H. Macy]]. It was screened out of competition at the [[2003 Cannes Film Festival]].&lt;ref name="festival-cannes.com"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.festival-cannes.com/en/archives/ficheFilm/id/4090051/year/2003.html |title=Festival de Cannes: Easy Riders, Raging Bulls |accessdate=2009-11-08|work=festival-cannes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Rotten Tomatoes]] gives the film a score of 100% based on reviews from 8 critics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/easy_riders_raging_bulls/|title=Easy Riders---Raging Bulls|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy and criticism==
Several of the film-makers profiled in the book have criticized Biskind. Robert Altman denounced both the book and Biskind's methods, saying "It was hate mail. We were all lured into talking to this guy because people thought he was a straight guy but he was filling a commission from the publisher for a hatchet job. He's the worst kind of human being I know."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Full exposure | author = Tim Adams | work = [[The Observer]] | date = 22 August 2004 | url = https://www.theguardian.com/film/2004/aug/22/film1 | archivedate = 2013-12-03 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20131203134613/http://www.theguardian.com/film/2004/aug/22/film1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Francis Ford Coppola was similarly critical, alleging that Biskind interviewed only people with negative opinions of him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=‘Easy Riders, Raging Bulls’ Author Peter Biskind Looks Back at the New Hollywood |author=Susan Wloszczyna |work=[[IndieWire]] |date=July 18, 2014 |url=http://www.indiewire.com/2014/07/easy-riders-raging-bulls-author-peter-biskind-looks-back-at-the-new-hollywood-191482/ |accessdate=August 3, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Critic [[Roger Ebert]] noted that Steven Spielberg said of ''Easy Riders, Raging Bulls'' that: "Every single word in that book about me is either erroneous or a lie."&lt;ref name="Ebert"&gt;{{cite web| title=TINSELTOWN AUTHOR GETS 'DOWN AND DIRTY,' INDEED |author=[[Roger Ebert]] |work=Rogerebert.com |date=February 22, 2004 |url=http://www.rogerebert.com/answer-man/tinseltown-author-gets-down-and-dirty-indeed |accessdate=August 3, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ebert himself notes that: "Biskind has a way of massaging his stories to suit his agenda."&lt;ref name="Ebert"/&gt; When asked about Biskind's portrayal of him as "a womanizer, a tyrant and a bully," William Friedkin said: "I've actually never read the book, but I've talked to some of my friends who are portrayed in it, and we all share the opinion that it is partial truth, partial myth and partial out-and-out lies by mostly rejected girlfriends and wives."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=The Exorcist Director William Friedkin Tells All in His No-Bullshit Memoir |author=Paul Teetor |work=[[LA Weekly]] |date=April 11, 2013 |url=http://www.laweekly.com/arts/the-exorcist-director-william-friedkin-tells-all-in-his-no-bullshit-memoir-4184306 |accessdate=August 3, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Peter Bogdanovich was equally furious, saying: "I spent seven hours with that guy over a period of days, and he got it all wrong".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Bogdanovich Epilogue: A Word About Biskind And Cher |author=David Poland |work=Movie City News |date=February 14, 2006 |url=http://moviecitynews.com/2006/02/bogdanovich-epilogue-a-word-about-biskind-and-cher/ |accessdate=August 3, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5611">'''Ecovention''' was a term invented by Amy Lipton and [[Sue Spaid]] in 1999 to refer to an [[ecological art]] intervention in environmental degradation.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.eyebeam.org/ecovention-current-art-to-transform-ecologies Eyebeam "Current Art to Transform Ecologies."&lt;/ref&gt; The Ecovention movement in art is associated with [[land art]], earthworks, and [[environmental art]], and [[landscape architecture]], but remains its own distinct category. Many ecoventions bear tendencies similar to public works projects such as sewage and waste-water treatment plants, public gardens, landfills, mines, and sustainable building projects.&lt;ref&gt;http://greenmuseum.org/c/ecovention/sect1.html#landart Greenmuseum.org Ecoventions&lt;/ref&gt;

The term ‘Ecovention’ appears by the composition of the terms 'ecology' and 'innovation' or 'intervention'. The intention was to concrete a kind of art that alludes to the interventions that artists were made in degraded natural territories, pretending to generate a public consciousness, showing the existence of solutions&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=MARÍN RUIZ|first1=Carmen|title=‘Arte medioambiental y ecología. Elementos para una reflexión crítica.’|date=2014|page=42}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The fact of restoring make the artists enter in a collaboration process with the nature in a social way. They help to generate a new paradigm teaching how art could help the society not only in a social or political criticism, but getting directly involved in the world. They are responsible for extending the various environmental principles and practices to the community. 

Artists will focus on various aspects like: biological, cultural, political or historical. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ecovention: current art to transform ecologies.|url=http://greenmuseum.org/c/ecovention/sect11.html|website=Greenmuseum}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, different professionals work that are fundamental; architects, botanists, zoologists, engineers, ecologists... all based on the imaginative idea of an artist&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=MARÍN RUIZ|first1=Carmen|title=‘Arte medioambiental y ecología. Elementos para una reflexión crítica.’|date=2014|page=98}}&lt;/ref&gt; 4.
Activism, the re-evaluation of territories, the study of diversity and the recovery of spaces will be some of its main characteristics. To carry them out, they use new techniques in order to transform that local ecology in order to reestablish natural resources and stabilize environments. His works have as a common goal to motivate the viewer to visit these spaces generating awareness and in turn encourage more interventions. 


Artists associated with ecovention include: [[Joseph Beuys]], [[Mel Chin]], [[Agnes Denes]], Helen and Newton Harrison, Ocean Earth, [[Robert Smithson]], Alan Sonfist, and [[Mierle Laderman Ukeles]], among others.

==Exhibitions==
''Ecovention'' is also the title of a 2002 exhibition at the ''Cincinnati [[Contemporary Arts Center]]'' in [[Ohio]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Ground works : environmental collaboration in contemporary art.|date=2005|publisher=Carnegie Mellon University|location=Pittsburgh, PA|isbn=978-0-9772053-1-8|page=21|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ffYQeG4MrRAC&amp;lpg=PA21&amp;dq=%22Ecovention%22%20lipton&amp;pg=PA21#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the title of exhibition catalog, joint published with the Greenmuseum.&lt;ref&gt;http://greenmuseum.org/c/ecovention/intro_frame.html Greenmuseum.org.

[[Image:Waka altar.jpg|thumb|250px|right| Carved [[altar]] from El Perú (Waka') in [[Guatemala]].]]
'''El Perú''' (also known as '''Waka' '''), is a [[pre-Columbian]] [[Maya civilization|Maya]] [[archeological site]] occupied during the [[Mesoamerican chronology|Preclassic]] and [[Mesoamerican chronology|Classic]] cultural chronology periods (roughly 500 BC to 800 AD). The site was the capital of a Maya [[city-state]] and is located near the banks of the [[San Pedro River (Guatemala)|San Pedro River]] in the [[Petén (department)|Department of Petén]] of northern [[Guatemala]]. El Perú is {{convert|60|km|mi|abbr=on}} west of [[Tikal]].

==Research==
The [[Maya civilization|Maya]] city of Waka' was rediscovered by oil prospectors in the 1960s. In the 1970s [[Ian Graham]], a Harvard researcher, documented monuments at the site. Then in 2003 [[David Freidel]], of Southern Methodist University, and Héctor Escobedo, of the University of San Carlos, began to [[excavate]] Waka'.&lt;ref name="Hardman (2008)"&gt;Hardman (2008): p. 57 [http://connection.ebscohost.com/c/articles/32045918/woman-power-maya-world].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
The site was named "El Perú" when rediscovered in the twentieth century. [[Hieroglyph]]s identified and deciphered at the site have indicated that the ancient name for the site was ''Waka'.'' While both names are currently used interchangeably, El Perú predominates on extant maps. In the published literature, a conflated name is generally used, El Perú-''Waka'.''

==History==
The first recorded meeting between [[Teotihuacan]] and the Maya occurred at Waka' in 378, 10 days prior to their arrival at Tikal. This moment is known among [[Mesoamerica]]n [[archaeologist]]s as “La Entrada.” During the early phases of the Early Classic, Waka’ was allied with [[Tikal]].

Waka’, however, later betrayed Tikal and forged an [[Political alliance|alliance]] with Calakmul. This alliance was solidified by K'inich Balam (“Sun Faced Jaguar”), who ruled from the late 7th century to the early 8th century and was married to Lady T'abi, a [[royal family|royal]] [[princess]] from [[Calakmul]], capital of the Kan [[dynasty]] at the time. This union was a [[Arranged marriage|political maneuver]] that linked El Peru (K’inich Balam) to Calakmul and its leader [[Calakmul#Known rulers|Yuknom Cheen]] in a [[military]] [[Political alliance|alliance]]. Lady T’abi was later given the title ''ix kaloomté'' ("empress" or "warlord”), a high title used in ancient Maya [[Written language|texts]]. Yuknom Cheen was attempting to gather several Maya [[monarchy|kingdom]]s into a larger [[polity]]

Waka’s downfall was likely initiated by its alliance with Calakmul. Following Tikal’s re-emergence from its hiatus in the Late Classic, Calakmul fell to its military might. Calakmul’s ruler Yik'in Chan K'awiil, likely the brother of Lady T'abi, was defeated, captured, and [[Sacrifice in Maya culture|sacrificed]] in Tikal’s central plaza in 732. Waka’ was converted into a [[vassal state]] of Tikal. Yik'in Chan K'awiil defeated Waka' in 743. After his victory he took an image of a celestial serpent from Waka' and brought it to Tikal. According to [[Robert Sharer]] the celestial serpent was possibly Waka's patron deity. Evidence for Yik'in Chan K'awiil's act can be found on Tikal's Temple IV. Not a year later he defeated Naranjo.&lt;ref name="Sharer (2006)"&gt;Sharer (2006).&lt;/ref&gt; Waka' was eventually destroyed a decade later, an event that included the capture and sacrifice of K'inich Balam's successor.

==Trading Power==
As a trading power, Waka' held proximity to the San Pedro River which flowed westward from the Petén. Waka also had access to a north-south overland route. This route connected south [[Campeche]] and the [[Petén Basin|Petén]]. The close location to the dominant [[Maya civilization|Maya]] capitals [[Calakmul]] and [[Tikal]] contributed to the trading power of Waka'.&lt;ref name="Hardman (2008)"/&gt; Waka's market included [[maize]], [[beans]], [[chili pepper]]s, [[avocados]], [[chicle]], and [[latex]]. Waka', also, obtained [[jade]] and [[quetzal]] feathers, used for costumes.

==Population and Layout==
Around 400, Waka' had a population containing tens of thousands people. According to Chris Hardman in "Woman Power in the Maya World," this was the political peak of the city. The reason for the high population was the ideal location and trading power of the city.

The city included hundreds of buildings, four [[plaza]]s, and [[ceremonial]] centers.&lt;ref name="Hardman (2008)"/&gt;
[[Archaeology|Archaeologists]] have divided El Perú into different groups and plazas. Plaza 1 is in the center of the site. Other plazas, built neighboring Plaza 1, include residence compounds. The Northwest group is located near Plaza 1 and a [[ballcourt]]. The Paal group can be found near Plaza 2 and south of Plaza 1. South east of Plaza 1 are the Chok and Tolok groups. Just below these groups is the [[El Mirador|Mirador]] Complex.&lt;ref name="Eppich (2009): p.3"&gt;Eppich (2009): p.3 [http://www.mesoweb.com/pari/journal/archive/PARI1002.pdf].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recent discoveries==
A number of tombs have recently been discovered at Waka' that contribute to the understanding of past Maya culture.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mesoweb.com/reports/waka2.html Tomb finds at El Peru]&lt;/ref&gt; One that is particularly important is the “Queen’s Tomb.” This [[feature (archaeology)|feature]] contains the remains of a female in a [[tomb]] containing a rich assortment of [[grave good]]s. Of particular importance is the presence of a [[Bloodletting rituals in Maya culture|bloodletting]] paraphernalia in the form of a [[ceremonial]] [[stingray|stingray spine]]. This object was in clear association with the individual’s [[genital]] region, and indicates that royal women practiced genitalia bloodletting [[ritual]]s.

An additional tomb for an elite individual was recently found within an 18 meter tall [[Mesoamerican pyramid|pyramid]] located in the site’s central core. The tomb’s chamber, which is 5.1 meters long by 1.5 meters wide, contained a rich [[Assemblage (archaeology)|assemblage]] of grave goods, including [[Jade use in Mesoamerica|jade offerings]], [[gastropod shell|shell]] artifacts, [[ceramic]] vessels, 12 [[Mesoamerican ballgame|ballgame player]] [[figurine]]s, the paws of [[jaguar]], and stones from the [[Geography of Mesoamerica|Eastern Highlands]] and the [[Soconusco|Pacific Lowlands]], which were used as signs of [[wealth]]. The early date of the tomb, between c. 200 and 400, indicates Waka’s early regional importance in the southern Maya lowlands.

Recent research at the site of [[Zapote Bobal]] suggests a strong connection between that site and El Perú. It is possible that El Perú may have had a strong influence on the dynasty centered at Zapote Bobal.&lt;ref&gt;Breuil et al. (2004).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Emblem Glyph===

====Early Classic====
The Early Classic period [[emblem glyph]] of El Perú consists of an [[Ajaw]] glyph connected to a zoomorphic head. According to Stanley Paul Guenter, this is similar to the Chapa(h)t [[logogram]]. Guenter also believes the zoomorphic head represents a centipede or creature with a face like a centipede's. The main sign of this glyph says ''Wak''. Guenter says this could be a word used for centipede however there is little evidence for this in previous knowledge of Mayan.&lt;ref name="Guenter (2007)"/&gt;

====Late Classic====
The Late classic shows a transition from iconographic logogram usage for the emblem glyph to use of syllables to spell out the name.

The "Snake Head Emblem" was originally thought to represent El Perú. This idea came from a pair of [[looted]] stelea [[Ian Graham]] said came from the site. Scholars [[David Stuart (Mayanist)|David Stuart]], [[Stephen Houston]], and others have found a different [[emblem glyph]] they believe provides a better representation of El Perú during the [[Late Classic]].

[[Simon Martin (Mayanist)|Simon Martin]] was the first to study this glyph in 2000. The emblem includes two [[hieroglyphs]]. The first glyph contains three different signs. The K'uh sign is a prefix for the glyph and according to Stanley Paul Guenter of [[Southern Methodist University]] the sign is used to represent something "divine." A male head with a spot on his cheek makes up the second part of the hieroglyph. Guenter says this is most likely a representation of the [[maize god]]. Above the head's ear is a K'in sign. On top of the male head is a sign David Stuart, and Stephen Houston read as Nal. Guenter says the sign requires further study before it can be legitimately read as Nal.

The second hieroglyph also contains three signs. The glyph includes an [[Ajaw]], a leadership title, superfix. Below this sign is the syllable ''ka''. The syllable ''wa'' makes the third sign. Simon Martin says this glyph should be read as ''Wak Ajaw''. He has identified '' Waka' '' as the ancient toponym for El Perú. In Stanley Paul Guenter's article, "Emblem Glyph of El Perú" he says ''-a' '' refers to the [[Maya language|Maya]] word used for water. Therefore, Waka' means "Wak-water" or "Wak-place." The possible meanings for ''wak'' include the number six or the description of a location on an escarpment. The latter possibility comes from ''wa''' meaning "stood up."

Kings in the Late Classic differed from Early Classic because they attached a second part to the emblem. This second part recognized new rulers and an alliance with [[Calakmul]].&lt;ref name="Guenter (2007)"&gt;Guenter (2007)[http://www.mesoweb.com/pari/publications/journal/802/PARI0802.pdf].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Stela 15===
Stela 15 is a monument containing only [[Maya script|Maya glyphs]]. Keith Eppich dates the stela to 416. The monument contains the names of rulers back until the mid 4th century.&lt;ref name="Eppich (2009): p.2"&gt;Eppich (2009):p.2.&lt;/ref&gt; The monument also describes how a foreign war leader Siyaj K'ahk, or [[Siyaj K'ak']] came to Waka' during January of 378. According to [[epigrapher]] [[David Stuart (Mayanist)]], this stela supports the idea of Siyaj K'ahk' traveling through Waka'  roughly eight days before taking over [[Tikal]]'s government.&lt;ref name="Freidel (2007)"&gt;Freidel (2007)[http://connection.ebscohost.com/c/articles/26608052/once-future-maya].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Stela 16===
[[Stela]] 16 was first sketched by [[Ian Graham]] in the early 1970s and later in 2004 by [[David Freidel]].

The monument, found a few yards away from Stela 15, shows a man wearing a headdress and royal outfit similar to rulers of [[Teotihuacan]]. The man holds a bird-headed staph on his right and a bundle on his left. [[David Freidel]] suggests the bird head is a symbol for "[[Spearthrower Owl]]." This was one name used for a certain king of [[Teotihuacan]], and the father of Siyaj K'ahk'. Epigrapher Stanley Guenter deciphered part of the [[Maya script]] on Stela 16 and believes it says "planted [his] banner stone, Siyaj K'ahk". Freidel thinks this monument is a depiction of the war leader many years after he had traveled through Waka'.&lt;ref name="Freidel (2007)"/&gt;

===Stela 30===
The text of [[stela]] 30 describes the contact of El Perú's king Mah-Kina-Balam and his wife to the king Jaguar-Paw, of [[Calakmul]]. The stela says they participated, along with other kings from western kingdoms, in the ritual of accession for Jaguar-Paw. One of these kings may have included Flint-Sky-God K of [[Dos Pilas]], well known for his many captives. The stela describes how Mah-Kina-Balam and his wife were a part of the period-ending rites and displayed the God K [[scepter]] to Jaguar-Paw. Stela 30 also gives proof of Jaguar-Paw's visits to El Perú.&lt;ref name="Schele and Freidel (1990)"&gt;Schele and Freidel (1990).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Stela 34===
This stela portrays a woman identified as Lady K'abel who is described as a lady warlord. She was the wife of king K'inich B'ahlam II and daughter of the [[Calakmul]] king Yuknoom Yich'aak K'ak'. The stela was found by a looter in the 1960s. It is believed to be dated to 692. Stela 34 would have been situated in one of the plazas.&lt;ref name="Hardman (2008): p.58"&gt;Hardman (2008): p.58.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lady K'abel's Tomb===
In 2004 [[tomb]], dating  between 650 and 750, was discovered by José Ambrosio Díaz. This tomb holds the remains of a high status woman. The tomb was identified as a royal [[tomb]] due to the amount of [[jade]]. [[Archaeology|Archaeologists]] believe the tomb may belong to Lady K'abel because the items within the tomb are similar to the image of her on Stela 34. The tomb was found in the main courtyard, under a building. Within the tomb were 23 vessels used for offerings, beads, shells, and a ''huunal'' jewel. This jewel was often placed on ''ko'haws'', helmets. These helmets were worn by war leaders. This suggests the woman was more powerful than most women of her time. [[Archaeology|Archaeologists]] do not believe this helmet necessarily means she was a war leader. It is more likely she was acting as a [[:wikt:guardian|guardian]] of items used in battle.&lt;ref name="Hardman (2008): p.58"/&gt;

===Tomb of Two Women===
In 2005 archaeologists Michelle Rich and Jennifer Piehl found the remains of two, possibly royal, women. The [[tomb]] is 4 feet high and 6.5 feet long. The two women were laid on top of each other with their backs touching. The woman on the bottom was pregnant. At the time of their death they were between the ages of 25 and 35. These women are believed to be royal because of their great condition of health and the [[Bowl|vessels]] within their tomb. Rich believes these women were [[sacrificed]] by a new ruler who sought to eliminate the current family in power.&lt;ref name="Hardman (2008): p.59"&gt;Hardman(2008): p.59.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Burial #39===
In 2006, Field Director Michelle Rich and her team discovered a collapsed [[tomb]] of a supposed ruler who died in the early 7th century. Burial #39 was located at pyramid O14-04 in the "adosada," also known as the front platform.&lt;ref name="Rich (2010)"&gt;Rich (2010).&lt;/ref&gt; The tomb was sealed by a stone wall which took the [[Archaeology|archaeologists]] five days to remove. The [[Artifact (archaeology)|artifacts]] within this tomb include painted and carved bones, [[mosaics]], jade, [[Mirrors in Mesoamerican culture|mirrors]], snake-like figurines, and ceramic figurines. The value of the items within this [[burial]] suggest the individual was a king.&lt;ref name="Freidel (2010)"&gt;Freidel (2010).&lt;/ref&gt; The king ruled after Muwaan Bahlam and before K'inich Bahlam II.&lt;ref name="Rich (2010)"/&gt;

====23 Ceramic Figurines====
Within Burial #39 a group of 23 figurines were found. In [[David Freidel]]'s article, "Resurrecting the Maize King," he discusses how these figurines are a depiction of a royal court performing a ceremony. More specifically the figures show a king kneeling with his arms crossed. The king figure's hair is similar to that of the [Maize God]. Freidel therefore names the unknown deceased individual the Maize King. Beside the king is a deer spirit, possibly healing the king. This deer spirit may have been the ''[[wayob|way]]'', spirit companion, of a different king watching the ceremony.

A figurine of a female singer conjures the deer spirit. Evidence for this includes the pigtail associated with [[shaman]]. She is also full of a red paint, thought to be the color of life. She holds sticks under her arm which may have been quill pens or used for counting. 
Beside the singer is a dwarf wearing a [[headdress]] similar to a deer. The dwarf is holding a shell trumpet which may have been used to conjure the deer from the underworld. Above the dwarf is a toad, often symbolic of birth in [ancient Maya] culture. Two other dwarf figurines are wearing helmets and look as if they are about to fight. Freidel suggests they might be boxers. [[Karl Taube]], of the University of California, and [[Marc Zender]], of Harvard University, believe boxing may have been a sport of ancient [[Meso-America]].

Two figures, thought to be the successor of Waka' and his queen, are situated on the left of the deer spirit. The king figure is called Scribe King because his headdress resembles a monkey and the monkey gods were associated with [[scribes]]. The headdress contains a green mask inside a red seashell, held by a thumb. Freidel says this represents life rising from the underworld and the resurrection of the dead ruler's soul.&lt;ref name="Freidel (2010)"/&gt;

====Olmec Style Figurine====
Another notable item found in Burial #39 includes an [[Olmec]]-like figurine. The figurine was found north of the buried ruler’s head. It was located inside two lip-to-lip [[Treasure trove|cache]] vessels. The inside of these vessels were coated with a red pigment partially made of [[cinnabar]]. According to Michelle Rich, ancient [[Maya peoples|Maya]] associated cinnabar coated caches, containing [[Sacrifice|offerings]], with resurrecting rulers, more specifically the [[maize god]]. A trefoil sprout on the crown of the figurine provides further evidence of a connection to the maize god. According to Michelle Rich this is used as a symbol for the maize god.

The figurine has one leg up, possibly showing dance movement. The left arm is bent and the right arm is missing. The top of the figurine’s head forms a fin. This represents either a fish or shark. The mouth of the figurine resembles a jaguar’s and contains a tooth much like a shark tooth. The crescent shape of the eyes are similar to the Olmec [[death god]]’s eyes, connecting the figurine to death. The low eye-lids of the figurine show a cross-bands [[Motif (visual arts)|motif]] on the right and a U shape on the left. These are often used as symbols of kingship. The figurine also has an engraving of the [[quatrefoil]] motif on the back. This suggests the figurine provides a way into the supernatural world.

The figurine is believed to be an [[heirloom]] of a dancing boy, representative of resurrection. This figurine was an important discovery because it is evidence that the ancient [[Maya peoples|Maya]] knew about the Olmec maize god.&lt;ref name="Rich (2010)"/&gt;

===Tolok Group Deposit===
A [[deposit (archeology)|deposit]] was found near the main residential compound, referred to as N14-2 by [[excavators]], of the Tolok group. This deposit contained the remains of two individuals, a two-year-old in burial #18 and a middle aged male in burial #19. The man was found under the staircase of N14-2 and had tabular modification of his skull. The two individuals had each been placed between two rocks and buried on top of broken ceramics. It is possible the deceased were sacrifices. Along with these individuals were items that suggested to researches the deposit was used for a [[ritual]] feasting event, important for establishing social position. The items included many bowls, plates, vases, bones of animals, ceramic figurines of a jaguar head and monkey wearing a headdress,  and musical instruments. Keith Eppich of [[Southern Methodist University]] believes the items were intentionally broken in the deposit for the feasting ritual. The location of the deposit gives further indication of a feasting ritual. The ritual occurred at the stairs of N 14-2, a common location for the dedication ritual called Och-Otot which means "enters house." This ritual was an act of paying debt to otherworldly powers and was often used with the construction of new architecture. Eppich says the two individuals were sacrificed and then became the "soul" of the building, N14-2.&lt;ref name="Eppich (2009): p.2-16"&gt;Eppich (2009): p.2-16.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Maya Warrior Queen===

In October 2012, the suspected tomb and remains of an important Maya queen were discovered at the site. During excavations led by [[David Freidel]] of [[Washington University in St. Louis]] uncovered a tomb in the city’s main pyramid temple and it was identified as belonging to Lady Ka’bel, the military ruler of the Wak kingdom between AD672 and 692.&lt;ref name=NG&gt;{{cite web| title=Tomb of Maya Queen Found—"Lady Snake Lord" Ruled Centipede Kingdom | author=James Owen| publisher=National Geographic| url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2012/10/121004-tomb-maya-warrior-queen-science-archaeology/|  date=4 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The body inside was buried with various offerings, including “ceramic vessels, jade jewellery, stone figurines, and a small alabaster jar carved in the shape of a conch shell, out of which the carved head and arms of an old woman emerge”.&lt;ref name=NG /&gt; Maya hieroglyphs on the back of the jar include the names "Lady Water Lily Hand" and "Lady Snake Lord," according to the study team. Both names are thought to refer to Lady K'abel, who governed the Wak kingdom for her family, the empire-building Kan, or "Snake," dynasty, based in the Maya capital [[Calakmul]].&lt;ref name=NG /&gt;

===El Peru altar===
An altar has been discovered at El Peru, featuring a [[quatrefoil]] on the back of a [[zoomorphic]] creature in which sits a ruler.&lt;ref&gt;FREIDEL, D.A., L. SCHELE &amp; J. PARKER. 1993.

Washington (D.C.): Dumbarton Oaks: 441&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"While the imagery bears remarkable similarities to that of [[Izapa]] Stela 8, the text of the El Peru altar elucidates the significance of the quatrefoil, describing it as ''tu yol ahk'', 'at the heart af the turtle' or 'in the portal of the turtle', a reference to the creation narrative of the [[Maize god]]'s rebirth".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1017/S0003598X00096009| title = Monument 3 from La Blanca, Guatemala: A Middle Preclassic earthen sculpture and its ritual associations| journal = Antiquity| volume = 81| issue = 314| pages = 920–932| year = 2007| last1 = Love | first1 = M. | last2 = Guernsey | first2 = J. | url = https://www.academia.edu/10688677/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==El Perú today==
While open to the public, Waka' is a difficult site to get to. It sits atop an [[escarpment]] in the Laguna del Tigre National Park (part of the [[Maya Biosphere Reserve]]), six kilometers north of the San Pedro River. The site can be reached via an arduous route from [[Flores, El Petén|Flores]], the closest town with an airport (the [[Mundo Maya International Airport]]).

[[Image:Genji emaki azumaya.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Detail from ''[[The Tale of Genji]]'' handscroll]]
{{Nihongo|'''''Emakimono'''''|絵巻物|emaki-mono|literally 'picture scroll'}}, often simply called {{Nihongo|'''''emaki'''''|絵巻}}, is a horizontal, illustrated narrative form created during the 11th to 16th centuries in [[Japan]]. ''Emakimono'' combines both text and pictures, and is drawn, painted, or stamped on a [[handscroll]].  They depict battles, romance, religion, folk tales, and stories of the supernatural world. 

==History and physical characteristics==
The [[handscroll]] and the [[hanging scroll]] are the two most common forms of Japanese painting.&lt;ref&gt;[http://web-japan.org/museum/emaki/about_em.html Overview of Scroll Painting (Emaki)]&lt;/ref&gt;  Handscrolls are painted on paper or silk, backed with paper. The farthest (left) end is fitted with a roller around which the scroll is rolled.  When rolled up, the scrolls are secured with a braided silk cord and can be safely carried, placed on shelves, or stored in a [[lacquerware]] box. Handscrolls range in size, averaging 30 centimeters (1 ft.) in height and 9 to 12 meters (30 to 40 ft.) in length.  A normal story covers one to three scrolls.

[[File:Takezaki suenaga ekotoba3.jpg|320px|thumb|Japanese [[samurai]] boarding [[ Mongol invasions of Japan|Mongol ships]] in 1281, from the ''[[Mōko Shūrai Ekotoba|Mōko shūrai ekotoba]]'' handscroll]]
''Emakimono'' are read by exposing an arms-length of the scroll at a time, from right to left, as [[Japanese language|Japanese]] is written.  It was common for there to be a written account of the story being illustrated either at the start of the scroll, or interspersed between the pictures.  It is expected that the person viewing the scroll will re-roll the scroll back in its original form, much as one is supposed to rewind [[video tape]] after viewing it.

''Emakimono'' also serve as some of the earliest and greatest examples of the ''[[otoko-e]]'' (Men's pictures) and ''[[onna-e]]'' (Women's pictures) styles of painting. There are many fine differences in the two styles, appealing to the aesthetic preferences of the genders. But perhaps most easily noticeable are the differences in subject matter. ''Onna-e'', epitomized by the Tale of Genji handscroll, typically deals with court life, particularly the court ladies, and with romantic themes. ''Otoko-e'', on the other hand, often recorded historical events, particularly battles. The [[Siege of Sanjō Palace|Siege of the Sanjō Palace]] (1160), depicted in the painting "Night Attack on the Sanjō Palace" is a famous example of this style.

==Well known examples==
The most often discussed example of ''emakimono'' is the [[The Tale of Genji#Illustrated scroll|''Genji monogatari emaki'']] dating from about 1130.  This ''emaki'' illustrates [[Murasaki Shikibu]]'s epic ''[[The Tale of Genji]]''.  Written about the year 1000, the novel deals with the life and loves of Genji and the world of the Heian court after his death.  While only 15% of the original scrolls remain, the fragments are protected as [[National Treasures of Japan|national treasures]].

The ''[[Chōjū giga]]'' (Scroll of Frolicking Animals) is unusual in its own medium, as it does not contain any text, only pictures.  It depicts scenes of animals in amusing scenes, analogizing Japanese society in the 12th century.

'''Feminist art criticism''' emerged in the 1970s from the wider [[feminist movement]] as the critical examination of both visual representations of women in art and art [[women artists|produced by women]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Deepwell|first=Katie|title=12 Step Guide to Feminist Art, Art History and Criticism|journal=n.paradoxa|date=Sep 2012|volume=online|issue=21|page=8|url=http://www.ktpress.co.uk/pdf/nparadoxaissue21.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; It continues to be a major field of [[art criticism]].

== Emergence ==
[[Linda Nochlin]]'s 1971 groundbreaking essay, "[[Why Have There Been No Great Women Artists?]]", analyzes the embedded privilege in the predominantly white, male, Western art world and argued that women's outsider status allowed them a unique viewpoint to not only critique women's position in art, but to additionally examine the discipline's underlying assumptions about gender and ability.&lt;ref name="Nochlin women artists"&gt;{{cite book|last=Nochlin|first=Linda|author-link=Linda Nochlin|title=Why Have There Been No Great Women Artists?| work = Women, Art and Power and Other Essays | year=1971 |publisher= Westview Press|url=|accessdate = 2014-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nochlin's essay develops the argument that both formal and social education restricted artistic development to men, preventing women (with rare exception) from honing their talents and gaining entry into the art world.&lt;ref name="Nochlin women artists" /&gt; In the 1970s, feminist art criticism continued this critique of the institutionalized sexism of art history, art museums, and galleries, as well as questioning which genres of art were deemed museum-worthy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1= Atkins |first1= Robert |author-link1= |year= 2013|title= Artspeak: A Guide to Contemporary Ideas, Movements, and Buzzwords, 1945 to the Present |edition= 3rd|location= New York|publisher= Abbeville Press |isbn= 9780789211507 |oclc=855858296}}&lt;/ref&gt; This position is articulated by artist [[Judy Chicago]]: "...it is crucial to understand that one of the ways in which the importance of male experience is conveyed is through the art objects that are exhibited and preserved in our museums. Whereas men experience presence in our art institutions, women experience primarily absence, except in images that do not necessarily reflect women's own sense of themselves."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Chicago|first1=Judy|author-link1=Judy Chicago|last2=Lucie-Smith|first2=Edward|author-link2=Edward Lucie-Smith|title=Women and Art: Contested Territory|year=1999|publisher=Watson-Guptill Publications|location=New York|isbn=0-8230-5852-2|page=10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Genius===
Nochlin challenges the myth of the Great Artist as 'Genius' as an inherently problematic construct. '[[Genius]]' “is thought of as an atemporal and mysterious power somehow embedded in the person of the Great Artist.”&lt;ref name="Nochlin women artists" /&gt;
This ‘god-like’ conception of the artist’s role is due to "the entire romantic, elitist, individual-glorifying, and monograph-producing substructure upon which the profession of art history is based."&lt;ref name="Nochlin women artists" /&gt; She develops this further by arguing that "if women had the golden nugget of artistic genius, it would reveal itself. But it has never revealed itself. Q.E.D. Women do not have the golden nugget of artistic genius."&lt;ref name="Nochlin women artists" /&gt; Nochlin deconstructs the myth of the 'Genius' by highlighting the unjustness in which the Western art world inherently privileges certain predominantly white male artists. In Western art, ‘Genius’ is a title that is generally reserved for artists such as, van Gogh, Picasso, Raphael, and Pollock—all white men.&lt;ref name="Nochlin women artists" /&gt; As recently demonstrated by Alessandro Giardino, when the concept of artistic genius started collapsing, women and marginal groups emerged at the forefront of artistic creation.&lt;ref&gt; Alessandro Giardino, ''[https://www.academia.edu/35257521/_Caravaggio_and_the_Enfranchisement_of_Women._New_Discoveries_Theory_in_Action_2017 "Caravaggio and the Enfranchisement of Women. New Discoveries"_]'', 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Museum organizations===
Similar to Nochlins’ assertions on women’s position in the art world, art historian [[Carol Duncan]] in the 1989 article, “The MoMA Hot Mamas”, examines the idea that institutions like the [[MoMA]] are masculinized. In MoMA’s collection, there is a disproportionate amount of sexualized female bodies by male artists on display compared to a low percentage of actual women artists included.&lt;ref name="Duncan MoMA"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/776968?uid=3739400&amp;uid=2&amp;uid=3737720&amp;uid=4&amp;sid=21104799788381 | title=The MoMA Hot Mamas | work=Art Journal | date=1998 | accessdate=2014-11-28 | last=Duncan | first=Carol | pages=171–178}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to data accumulated by the Guerrilla Girls, “less than 3% of the artists in the Modern Art section of New York’s Metropolitan Museum of Art are women, but 83% of the nudes are female”, even though “51% of visual artists today are women.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Get the Facts|work = National Museum of Women in the Arts |url= http://nmwa.org/advocate/get-facts |accessdate = 2014-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Duncan claims that, in regards to women artists:

&lt;blockquote&gt;In the MoMA and other museums, their numbers are kept well below the point where they might effectively dilute its masculinity. The female presence is necessary only in the form of imagery. Of course, men, too, are occasionally represented. Unlike women, who are seen primarily as sexually accessible bodies, men are portrayed as physically and mentally active beings who creatively shape their world and ponder its meanings.&lt;ref name="Duncan MoMA" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This article narrows its focus on one institution to use as an example to draw from and expand on. Ultimately to illustrate the ways in which institutions are complicit in patriarchal and racist ideologies.

=== Intersectionality ===

Women of color in the art world were often not addressed in earlier feminist art criticism. An intersectional analysis that includes not only gender but also race and other marginalized identities is essential.

[[Audre Lorde]]’s 1984 essay “[http://www.muhlenberg.edu/media/contentassets/pdf/campuslife/sdp%20reading%20lorde.pdf The Master’s Tools Will Never Dismantle The Master’s House],” briefly addresses a vital dilemma that artists who are women of color are often overlooked or tokenized in the visual arts. She argues that "in academic feminist circles, the answer to these questions is often, ‘We did not know who to ask.’ But that is the same evasion of responsibility, the same cop-out, that keeps Black women's art out of women's exhibitions, Black women's work out of most feminist publications except for the occasional ‘Special Third World Women's Issue,’ and Black women's texts off your reading lists.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite| last = Lorde| first = Audre| author-link = Audre Lorde | title = The Master’s Tools Will Never Dismantle The Master’s House| work = [[Sister Outsider]]: Essays and Speeches| year=1984|publisher=Crossing Press|location=Berkeley|pages=110–114|accessdate = 2014-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lorde’s statement brings up how important it is to consider intersectionality in these feminist art discourses, as race is just as integral to any discussion on gender.

Furthermore, [[bell hooks]] expands on the discourse of black representation in the visual arts to include other factors. In her 1995 book, ''Art on My Mind'', hooks positions her writings on the visual politics of both race and class in the art world. She states that the reason art is rendered meaningless in the lives of most black people is not solely due to the lack of representation, but also because of an entrenched colonization of the mind and imagination and how it is intertwined with the process of identification.&lt;ref name="hooks Art"&gt;{{Cite book| last =hooks| first = bell| author-link = bell hooks | date=1995|title = Art on My Mind: Visual Politics|url=http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/31737494|location= New York|publisher= New Press|isbn= 9781565842632|accessdate = 2014-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|4}} Thus she stresses for a “shift [in] conventional ways of thinking about the function of art. There must be a revolution in the way we see, the way we look,"&lt;ref name="hooks Art" /&gt;{{rp|4}} emphasizing how visual art has the potential to be an empowering force within the black community. Especially if one can break free from "imperialist white-supremacist notions of the way art should look and function in society."&lt;ref name="hooks Art" /&gt;{{rp|5}}

== Intersection with other schools of thought ==
Feminist art criticism is a smaller subgroup in the larger realm of [[feminist theory]], because feminist theory seeks to explore the themes of [[discrimination]], [[sexual objectification]], [[oppression]], [[patriarchy]], and [[stereotyping]], feminist art criticism attempts similar exploration.

This exploration can be accomplished through a variety of means. [[Structuralism|Structuralist theories]], [[deconstructionist]] thought, [[psychoanalysis]], [[Queer theory|queer analysis]], and [[semiotic]] interpretations can be used to further comprehend gender symbolism and representation in artistic works. The social structures regarding gender that influence a piece can be understood through interpretations based on stylistic influences and biographical interpretations.

=== Freudian Psychoanalytic Theory ===

[[Laura Mulvey]]'s 1975 essay, "[[Visual Pleasure and Narrative Cinema]]" focuses on the gaze of the spectator from a Freudian perspective. Freud's concept of [[scopophilia]] relates to the objectification of women in art works. The gaze of the viewer is, in essence, a sexually charged instinct.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|last= Mulvey|first= Laura|author-link= Laura Mulvey|editor1-first= Karyn|editor1-last= Kay|editor2-first= Gerald|editor2-last= Peary|editor2-link= Gerald Peary|encyclopedia= Women and the Cinema: A Critical Anthology|title= Visual Pleasure and Narrative Cinema|year= 1977|publisher= Dutton|location= New York|isbn= 0525474595|oclc= 3315936}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of the gender inequity that exists in the art sphere, the artist's portrayal of a subject is generally a man's portrayal of women. Other [[Freudian]] symbolism can be used to comprehend pieces of art from a feminist perspective—whether gender specific symbols are uncovered through psychoanalytic theory (such as [[phallic]] or [[yonic]] symbols) or specific symbols are used to represent women in a given piece.

=== Realism and Reflectionism ===
Are the women depicted in an artistic work realistic portrayals of women? Writer [[Toril Moi]] explained in her 1985 essay "'Images of Women' Criticism" that "reflectionism posits that the artist's selective creation should be measured against 'real life,' thus assuming that the only constraint on the artist's work is his or her perception of the 'real world.'"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|last= Moi|first= Toril|author-link= Toril Moi|editor-first= Moi|editor-last= Toril|editor-link= Toril Moi|encyclopedia= Sexual/Textual Politics: Feminist Literary Theory|title= 'Images of women’ criticism|year= 1985|publisher= Methuen|location= London|isbn= 0416353606|oclc= 12103885|pages= 42ff.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Journals and publication ==
The 1970s also saw the emergence of feminist art journals, including ''The Feminist Art Journal'' in 1972&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Elizabeth A. Sackler Center for Feminist Art: Feminist Timeline: United States|url=http://www.brooklynmuseum.org/eascfa/feminist_timeline/plain_text.php|accessdate=1 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[Heresies: A Feminist Publication on Art and Politics|Heresies]]'' in 1977. The journal ''[[n.paradoxa]]'' has been dedicated to an international perspective on feminist art since 1996.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ktpress.co.uk/feminist-art-magazines.asp A List of Past and Present Feminist Art Journals on n.paradoxa's information pages]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Beyond the academy ==
In 1989, the [[Guerrilla Girls|Guerilla Girls]]' poster protest&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=HOW WOMEN GET MAXIMUM EXPOSURE IN ART MUSEUMS|url=http://www.guerrillagirls.com/posters/getnaked.shtml|accessdate=1 February 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131125204514/http://www.guerrillagirls.com/posters/getnaked.shtml|archivedate=25 November 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]]'s gender imbalance brought this feminist critique out of the academy and into the public sphere.

===Exhibition===
In 2007, the exhibit "[[WACK! Art and the Feminist Revolution]]" presented works of 120 international artists and artists’ groups at the Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| last = Johnson| first = Ken| author-link1 = Ken Johnson (art critic)|title = WACK!: Art and the Feminist Revolution - Art - Review| work = New York Times| accessdate = 2014-11-28| date = 2008-02-15| url = https://www.nytimes.com/2008/02/15/arts/design/15wack.html?_r=0}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was the first show of its kind that employed a comprehensive view of the intersection between feminism and art from the late 1960s to the early 1980s.&lt;ref name="Ozler Wack"&gt;{{Cite web| last = Ozler| first = Levent| title = Wack!: Art and the Feminist Revolution| work = Dexigner| accessdate = 2014-11-28| date = 2007-02-16| url = https://www.dexigner.com/news/10312}}&lt;/ref&gt; WACK! “argues that feminism was perhaps the most influential of any postwar art movement-on an international level-in its impact on subsequent generations of artists.”&lt;ref name="Ozler Wack" /&gt;

Rosemary Betteron’s 2003 essay, “Feminist Viewing: Viewing Feminism”, insists that older feminist art criticism must adapt to newer models, as our culture has shifted significantly since the late twentieth century. Betterton points out:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Feminist art criticism is no longer the marginalized discourse that it once was; indeed it had produced some brilliant and engaging writing over the last decade and in many ways has become a key site of academic production. But, as feminist writers and teachers, we need to address ways of thinking through new forms of social engagement between feminism and the visual, and of understanding the different ways in which visual culture is currently inhabited by our students.&lt;ref name="Betterton Feminist"&gt;{{Cite book| last = Betterton| first = Rosemary| title = Feminist Viewing: Viewing Feminism| work = The Feminist Visual Cultural Reader| year=2003|publisher=Routledge|location=London|pages=11–14|accessdate = 2014-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

According to Betterton, the models used to critique a Pre-Raphaelite painting are not likely to be applicable in the twenty-first century.&lt;ref name="Betterton Feminist" /&gt; She also expresses that we should explore ‘difference’ in position and knowledge, since in our contemporary visual culture we are more used to engaging with "multi-layered text and image complexes" (video, digital media, and the Internet).&lt;ref name="Betterton Feminist" /&gt; Our ways of viewing have changed considerably since the 1970s.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9024">In [[linguistics|linguistic]] [[semantics]], a '''generalized quantifier''' ('''GQ''') is an expression that denotes a [[set of sets]].  This is the standard semantics assigned to [[Quantifier (linguistics)|quantified]] [[noun phrase]]s. For example, the generalized quantifier ''every boy''  denotes the set of sets of which every boy is a member. 

:: &lt;math&gt;\{X  \,|\, \{x \,|\, \mbox{x is a boy}\} \subseteq X \}&lt;/math&gt;

This treatment of quantifiers has been essential in achieving a [[compositionality|compositional]] [[semantics]] for sentences containing quantifiers.&lt;ref&gt; [[Richard Montague|Montague, Richard]]: 1974, '[http://www.blackwellpublishing.com/content/BPL_Images/Content_store/Sample_chapter/9780631215417/Portner.pdf The proper treatment of quantification in English]',
in R. Montague, Formal Philosophy, ed. by R. Thomason (New Haven). &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Barwise, Jon and Robin Cooper. 1981. Generalized quantifiers and natural language. ''Linguistics and Philosophy'' 4: 159-219.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Type theory==
A version of [[type theory]] is often used to make the semantics of different kinds of expressions explicit. The standard construction defines the set of types [[recursion|recursively]] as follows:
#''e'' and ''t'' are types.
#If ''a'' and ''b'' are both types, then so is &lt;math&gt;\langle a,b\rangle&lt;/math&gt;
#Nothing is a type, except what can be constructed on the basis of lines 1 and 2 above.

Given this definition, we have the simple types ''e'' and ''t'', but also a [[countable]] [[infinity]] of complex types, some of which include:
::&lt;math&gt;\langle e,t\rangle;\qquad \langle t,t\rangle;\qquad \langle\langle e,t\rangle, t\rangle; \qquad\langle e,\langle e,t\rangle\rangle; \qquad \langle\langle e,t\rangle,\langle \langle e, t\rangle, t\rangle\rangle;\qquad \ldots&lt;/math&gt;

*Expressions of type ''e'' denote elements of the [[universe of discourse]], the set of entities the discourse is about. This set is usually written as &lt;math&gt;D_e&lt;/math&gt;.  Examples of type ''e'' expressions include ''John'' and ''he''. 
*Expressions of type ''t'' denote a [[truth value]], usually rendered as the set&lt;math&gt;\{0,1\}&lt;/math&gt;, where 0 stands for "false" and 1 stands for "true".   Examples of expressions that are sometimes said to be of type ''t'' are ''sentences'' or ''propositions''.
*Expressions of type &lt;math&gt;\langle e,t\rangle&lt;/math&gt; denote [[Function (mathematics)|functions]] from the set of entities to the set of truth values. This set of functions is rendered as &lt;math&gt;D_t^{D_e}&lt;/math&gt;. Such functions are [[Indicator function|characteristic functions]] of [[Set (mathematics)|sets]].   They map every individual that is an element of the set to "true", and everything else to "false."  It is common to say that they denote ''sets'' rather than characteristic functions, although, strictly speaking, the latter is more accurate. Examples of expressions of this type are [[predicate (grammar)|predicates]], [[noun]]s and some kinds of [[adjective]]s. 
*In general, expressions of complex types &lt;math&gt;\langle a,b\rangle&lt;/math&gt; denote functions from the set of entities of type &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; to the set of entities of type &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt;, a construct we can write as follows: &lt;math&gt;D_b^{D_a}&lt;/math&gt;.

We can now assign types to the words in our sentence above (Every boy sleeps) as follows.
**Type(boy)=&lt;math&gt;\langle e,t\rangle&lt;/math&gt;
**Type(sleeps)=&lt;math&gt;\langle e,t\rangle&lt;/math&gt;
**Type(every)= &lt;math&gt;\langle\langle e,t\rangle,\langle \langle e, t\rangle, t\rangle\rangle&lt;/math&gt;

Thus, every denotes a function from a ''set'' to a function from a set to a truth value.  Put differently, it denotes a function from a set to a set of sets.  It is that function which for any two sets ''A,B'', ''every''(''A'')(''B'')= 1 if and only if &lt;math&gt;A\subseteq B&lt;/math&gt;.

==Typed lambda calculus==
A useful way to write complex functions is the [[lambda calculus]]. For example, one can write the meaning of ''sleeps'' as the following lambda expression, which is a function from an individual ''x'' to the proposition that ''x sleeps''.
::&lt;math&gt;\lambda x. sleep'(x)&lt;/math&gt;
Such lambda terms are functions whose domain is what precedes the period, and whose range are the type of thing that follows the period. If ''x'' is a variable that ranges over elements of &lt;math&gt;D_e&lt;/math&gt;, then the following lambda term denotes the [[identity function]] on individuals:
::&lt;math&gt;\lambda x.x&lt;/math&gt;

We can now write the meaning of ''every'' with the following lambda term, where ''X,Y'' are variables of type &lt;math&gt;\langle e,t\rangle&lt;/math&gt;:

::&lt;math&gt;\lambda X.\lambda Y. X\subseteq Y&lt;/math&gt;

If we abbreviate the meaning of ''boy'' and ''sleeps'' as "''B''" and "''S''", respectively, we have that the sentence ''every boy sleeps'' now means the following:
::&lt;math&gt;(\lambda X.\lambda Y. X\subseteq Y)(B)(S)&lt;/math&gt; — [[Lambda calculus#β-reduction|β-reduction]]
::&lt;math&gt;(\lambda Y. B \subseteq Y)(S)&lt;/math&gt; — β-reduction
::&lt;math&gt;B\subseteq S&lt;/math&gt;

The expression ''every'' is a [[determiner (linguistics)|determiner]]. Combined with a [[noun]], it yields a ''generalized quantifier'' of type &lt;math&gt;\langle\langle e,t\rangle,t\rangle&lt;/math&gt;.

==Properties==
===Monotonicity===
====Monotone increasing GQs====
A ''generalized quantifier'' GQ is said to be [[monotone increasing]], also called [[upward entailing]], just in case, for any two sets ''X'' and ''Y'' the following holds:
::if &lt;math&gt;X\subseteq Y&lt;/math&gt;, then GQ(''X'') [[Entailment|entail]]s GQ(''Y'').
The GQ ''every boy'' is monotone increasing. For example, the set of things that ''run fast'' is a subset of the set of things that ''run''. Therefore, the first sentence below [[Entailment|entail]]s the second:
#Every boy runs fast.
#Every boy runs.

====Monotone decreasing GQs====
A GQ is said to be [[monotone decreasing]], also called [[downward entailing]] just in case, for any two sets ''X'' and ''Y'', the following holds:
::If &lt;math&gt;X\subseteq Y&lt;/math&gt;, then GQ(''Y'') entails GQ(''X'').
An example of a monotone decreasing GQ is ''no boy''. For this GQ we have that the first sentence below entails the second.
#No boy runs.
#No boy runs fast.
The lambda term for the [[determiner (linguistics)|determiner]] ''no'' is the following. It says that the two sets have an empty [[Intersection (set theory)|intersection]].
::&lt;math&gt;\lambda X.\lambda Y. X\cap Y= \emptyset&lt;/math&gt;
Monotone decreasing GQs are among the expressions that can license a [[negative polarity item]], such as ''any''. Monotone increasing GQs do not license negative polarity items.
#Good: No boy has '''any''' money.
#Bad: *Every boy has '''any''' money.

====Non-monotone GQs====
A GQ is said to be ''non-monotone'' if it is neither monotone increasing nor monotone decreasing. An example of such a GQ is ''exactly three boys''. Neither of the following two sentences entail the other.
#Exactly three students ran.
#Exactly three students ran fast.
The first sentence doesn't entail the second. The fact that the number of students that ran is exactly three doesn't entail that each of these students ''ran fast'', so the number of students that did that can be smaller than 3. Conversely, the second sentence doesn't entail the first.  The sentence ''exactly three students ran fast'' can be true, even though the number of students who merely ran (i.e. not so fast) is greater than 3.

The lambda term for the (complex) [[determiner (linguistics)|determiner]] ''exactly three'' is the following. It says that the [[cardinality]] of the [[Intersection (set theory)|intersection]] between the two sets equals 3.
::&lt;math&gt;\lambda X.\lambda Y. |X\cap Y|=3&lt;/math&gt;

===Conservativity===
A determiner D is said to be ''conservative'' if the following equivalence holds:
::&lt;math&gt;D(A)(B)\leftrightarrow D(A)(A\cap B)&lt;/math&gt;
For example, the following two sentences are equivalent.
#Every boy sleeps.
#Every boy is a boy who sleeps.

It has been proposed that ''all'' natural language determiners (i.e. in every language) are conservative ([[Jon Barwise|Barwise]] and Cooper 1981).  The expression ''only'' is not conservative. The following two sentences are not equivalent.  But it is, in fact not common to analyze ''only'' as a [[determiner (linguistics)|determiner]]. Rather, it is standardly treated as a [[focus-sensitive]] [[adverb]].
#Only boys sleep.
#Only boys are boys who sleep.

'''Glencairn''' (1928-39) is a castle-like mansion in [[Bryn Athyn, Pennsylvania]], that was home to the Pitcairn family for more than 40 years. Now the '''Glencairn Museum''', it contains a collection of about 8,000 artworks, mostly religious in nature, from cultures such as [[ancient Egypt]], [[ancient Greece]], the [[Roman Empire]] and medieval Europe, as well as [[Islam]]ic, [[Asia]]n, and [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] works. The museum is affiliated with [[The New Church]], and the building is on the [[National Register of Historic Places]]. 

==Mansion==
[[File:Glencairn Museum - Great Room.jpg|thumb|left|Great Hall, May 2017]]
Multi-millionaire businessman [[Raymond Pitcairn]] (1885–1966) and his wife, Mildred Glenn (died 1979) built "Glencairn" between 1928 and 1939. Its name was a combination of their surnames. Pitcairn, a member of the New Church himself, had no formal training in architecture and designed the [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]]-style building using a series of models. The nine-story, [[granite]]-and-ruddy-colored-stone mansion features more than 90 rooms on 10 floors. It has three main sections &amp;ndash; a central rectangle, and two large rectangular wings &amp;ndash; that together measure approximately 175 feet by 135 feet. The exterior features a nine-story tower, carved doorways, pillars, and wall insets. The building also contains elaborate interior mosaics, [[monel]] metalwork, Early Medieval stained glass windows, and a [[Replicas of the Jewish Temple|replica of the Biblical tabernacle]].&lt;ref name="arch"&gt;{{cite web| url = https://www.dot7.state.pa.us/ce/SelectWelcome.asp| title = National Historic Landmarks &amp; National Register of Historic Places in Pennsylvania| publisher = CRGIS: Cultural Resources Geographic Information System| format = Searchable database}} ''Note:'' This includes {{cite web| url = {{NRHP-PA|H000536_01H.pdf}}| title = National Register of Historic Places Inventory Nomination Form: Glencairn| accessdate = 2012-03-24|author1=Rev.

The Pitcairn fortune derived from control of [[PPG Industries|Pittsburgh Plate Glass Company]], of which his father [[John Pitcairn, Jr.]] (1841-1916), was director, 1896-1906. Adjacent to "Glencairn" is Raymond Pitcairn's first architectural success, the [[Gothic Revival]] [[Bryn Athyn Cathedral]] (1913–19), and his father's house "[[Cairnwood]]." The Pitcairns were funders of the [[American Liberty League]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pitcairn.com/ Pitcairn Financial Group]&lt;/ref&gt;  Following Mildred's death in 1979 (Raymond died in 1966), the mansion, with its collections and Pitcairn archives, was given to the Academy of the New Church.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.glencairnmuseum.org/ Glencairn Museum]&lt;/ref&gt; 

"Glencairn" was added to the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 1978 and is a contributing property of the [[Bryn Athyn Historic District]].&lt;ref name="nris"/&gt;

==Glencairn Museum==
Guided tours of the building and collection are available year-round. Tours are offered Tuesday through Friday at 2:30pm or by appointment, and weekends at 1:00, 1:45, 2:30 and 3pm. The Museum's first floor, including the Great Hall, Upper Hall, Bird Room, and current temporary exhibition, is open free of charge for self-guided viewing on weekends from 1:00 to 4:30 pm.

Glencairn Museum also offers a variety of events and exhibitions throughout the year.

'''Ichkeul Lake''' ({{lang-ar|بحيرة اشكل}}) is a [[lake]] in northern [[Tunisia]], located 20 kilometres ( 12 miles) to [[Bizerte]], the northernmost city in Africa on the [[Mediterranean Sea]]. The lake and [[wetlands]] of '''Ichkeul National Park''' are an important stopping-over point for hundreds of thousands of [[bird migration|migrating birds]] each year. Among the lake's visitors are [[duck]]s, [[goose|geese]], [[stork]]s, and [[Flamingo|pink flamingoes]]. [[Dam]] construction on the lake's feeder rivers has produced major changes to the [[ecology|ecological]] balance of the lake and wetlands.

==History==
[[File:Ichkeul National Park-130277.jpg|thumb|200px|The Ichkeul lake]]

Because dams have sharply reduced the freshwater inflow to the lakes and [[marsh]]es, the [[reedbed]]s, [[Cyperaceae|sedges]], and other fresh-water plant species have been replaced with salt-loving plants. These changes have produced a sharp reduction in the migratory bird populations, which depend on the mix of plants that used to exist.

According to the UNESCO Website, the Tunisian government has undertaken some steps to retain freshwater and reduce [[salinity]], and the lake was removed from UNESCO's list of World heritage in danger in 2006.

However some reports from the [[World Conservation Union]] suggest that the salinity has already become excessively high and the possibility for rehabilitation may be rapidly disappearing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/IOTD/view.php?id=6209|title=Ichkeul Lake, Tunisia : Image of the Day|date=0001-11-30|website=earthobservatory.nasa.gov|language=en|access-date=2017-07-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"'''In God We Trust'''" is the [[United States national motto|official motto]] of the [[United States|United States of America]], [[Nicaragua]], and of the [[U.S. state]] of [[Florida]]. It was adopted as the nation's motto in 1956 as a replacement or alternative to the unofficial motto of ''[[E pluribus unum]]'', which was adopted when the [[Great Seal of the United States]] was created and adopted in 1782.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CxtVAAAAYAAJ&amp;q=In+1956,+an+official+national+motto+was+adopted,+%22In+God+We+Trust,%22+replacing+the+unofficial+%22E+Pluribus+Unum.%22&amp;dq=In+1956,+an+official+national+motto+was+adopted,+%22In+God+We+Trust,%22+replacing+the+unofficial+%22E+Pluribus+Unum.%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=BGKsadjbfausdghasudghflasgdihasl;rghawuilrgfarhuglarhugzaehgl%20iuhalrighuafT4q_IKfj0QGWg6n_AQ&amp;ved=0CDIQ6AEwAA|title=Annual report – American Civil Liberties Union, Volume 5|year=1951|publisher=[[American Civil Liberties Union]]|quote=In 1956, an official national motto was adopted, "In God We Trust," replacing the unofficial "E Pluribus Unum."|accessdate=1 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=N6lrAmPlbvIC&amp;pg=PA79&amp;dq=#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Refiguring Mass Communication: A History|date=24 March 2010|publisher=[[University of Illinois Press]]|quote=He held high the Declaration of Independence, the Constitution, and the nation's unofficial motto, ''e pluribus unum'', even as he was recoiling from the party system in which he had long participated.|accessdate=1 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A law passed in a Joint Resolution by the 84th Congress (P.L. 84-140) and approved by President [[Dwight Eisenhower]] on July 30, 1956, declared "In God We Trust" must appear on American currency. This phrase was first used on paper money in 1957, when it appeared on the one-dollar silver certificate. The first paper currency bearing the phrase entered circulation on October 1, 1957.&lt;ref name="USTreasury"/&gt; The 84th Congress later passed legislation (P.L. 84-851), also signed by President Eisenhower on July 30, 1956, declaring the phrase to be the national motto.&lt;ref&gt;{{USC|36|302}} ''National motto''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="USTFS"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.treasury.gov/about/education/Pages/in-god-we-trust.aspx|title=U.S. on the History of "In God We Trust"|publisher=United States Department of the Treasury|accessdate=2009-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="USPL84-851"&gt;[http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/STATUTE-70/pdf/STATUTE-70-Pg732-2.pdf United States Public Law 84-851], United States Public Law 84-851.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some groups and people have expressed objections to its use, citing its religious reference that violates the [[Establishment Clause]] of the [[First Amendment]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=12 Mar 2010 |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/northamerica/7426824/Atheist-in-battle-to-remove-In-God-We-Trust-from-US-currency.html |title=Atheist in battle to remove 'In God We Trust' from US currency |publisher=Telegraph |date=2010-03-12 |accessdate=2014-02-04 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; These groups believe the phrase should be removed from currency and public property.

In 1860, the phrase was used in the [[Coat of arms of New Westminster]], Canada. The phrase has been included in many hymns and religious-patriotic songs. During the [[American Civil War]], the [[125th Pennsylvania Infantry]] for the [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] [[Union Army|Army]] assumed the motto "In God we trust" in early August 1862.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=The Regimental Committee|first=125th PA Volunteers, 1862–1863|title=Regimental History|year=2009|publisher=Cornell University Library|location=Ithaca, NY|isbn=978-1-112-13570-5|pages=150–152}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Alexander|first=ted|title=The Battle of Antietam|year=2011|publisher=The History Press|location=Charleston, SC|isbn=978-1-60949-179-6|page=76}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite av media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fLc6WDOMUwA|title=125th PA Vol. Infantry: IN GOD WE TRUST|date=28 June 2012|work=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt; William W. Wallace, coiner, circa August 1862, of the motto "In God We Trust"{{sfn| Regimental Committee| 1906|p=151}} was Captain of Company C of the 125th Pennsylvania Infantry.

The Reverend [[Mark R. Watkinson]] of '[[Ridleyville]]', [[Pennsylvania]], (pastor of Prospect Hill Baptist Church in present-day [[Prospect Park, Pennsylvania]]) in a letter dated November 13, 1861, petitioned the Treasury Department to add a statement recognizing "[[Almighty God]] in some form on our coins" in order to "relieve us from the ignominy of heathenism".&lt;ref name=Treasury&gt;{{cite web|title=History of 'In God We Trust'|url=http://www.treasury.gov/about/education/Pages/in-god-we-trust.aspx|publisher=U.S. Department of the Treasury|accessdate=3 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="US-CSS"&gt;United States (1897). ''Congressional Serial Set''. US: Government Printing Office, [https://books.google.com/books?id=Yv0qAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA260 p. 260.]&lt;/ref&gt; At least part of the motivation was to declare that [[God]] was on the Union side of the [[American Civil War|Civil War.]]&lt;ref name="history"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.treasury.gov/about/education/Pages/in-god-we-trust.aspx|title=History of 'In God We Trust'|work=treasury.gov|accessdate=2016-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Treasury Secretary [[Salmon P. Chase]] acted on this proposal and directed the then-Philadelphia [[Director of the United States Mint|Director of the Mint]], [[James Pollock]], to begin drawing up possible designs that would include the religious phrase. Chase chose his favorite designs and presented a proposal to Congress for the new designs in late 1863.&lt;ref&gt;Duncan, Ann W. (2008). [https://books.google.com/books?id=zzOn09EaETgC&amp;pg=PA63 Religion, Rhetoric, and Ritual in the U.S. Government,"] ''Church-state Issues in America Today''. Westport CT: Greenwood Publishing Group, [https://books.google.com/books?id=zzOn09EaETgC&amp;pg=PA77 pp. 77.]&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 1863, [[Abraham Lincoln]]'s Secretary of the Treasury decided on a new motto, "In God We Trust," to engrave on U.S. coins. Lincoln's involvement in this decision is unclear.&lt;ref&gt;According to The ''Congressional Record'' (1908, House), p. 3387, the motto was adopted "doubtless with his [Lincoln's] knowledge and approval."
&lt;/ref&gt;

A version of the motto made an early appearance on obverse side of the [[Interest bearing note#Denominational set of interest bearing notes|twenty dollar interest bearing note]] issued in 1864 along with the motto "God and our Right".

As Chase was preparing his recommendation to Congress, it was found that the Act of Congress dated January 18, 1837 prescribed the mottoes and devices that should be placed upon the coins of the United States. This meant that the mint could make no changes without the enactment of additional legislation by the Congress. Such legislation was introduced and passed as the [[Coinage Act of 1864]] on April 22, 1864, allowing the Secretary of the Treasury to authorize the inclusion of the phrase on one-cent and two-cent coins.&lt;ref name="history" /&gt;

An Act of Congress passed on March 3, 1865, allowed the Mint Director, with the Secretary's approval, to place the motto on all gold and silver coins that "shall admit the inscription thereon".&lt;ref name="history" /&gt;&lt;ref name=CR1956p13917&gt;[http://www.nonbeliever.org/images/CR102-13917.pdf ''Congressional Record'', 1956, p. 13917], via NonBeliever.org&lt;/ref&gt; In 1873, Congress passed the Coinage Act, granting that the Secretary of the Treasury "may cause the motto IN GOD WE TRUST to be inscribed on such coins as shall admit of such motto".

The similar phrase 'In God is our Trust' appears in "[[The Star-Spangled Banner]]", adopted as the national anthem of the United States in 1931. Written by [[Francis Scott Key]] during the [[War of 1812]], the fourth stanza includes the phrase, "And this be our motto: 'In God is our Trust'", which was adapted as the national motto.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |url=http://time.com/4179685/in-god-we-trust-currency-history/ |title=How 'In God We Trust' Got on the Currency in the First Place |first=Sarah |last=Begley |magazine=Time |date=January 13, 2016 |access-date=February 24, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{better source|reason=We have one 2016 article that mentions this supposed concious adaptation, but are there any other secondary sources that make this claim? For instance, are there any mentions of this connection from 1863, 1931 or 1956? Or maybe a later scholarly analysis of the motto?|date=March 2018}}

The use of "In God We Trust" has been interrupted. The motto disappeared from the five-cent coin in 1883, and did not reappear until production of the Jefferson nickel began in 1938.&lt;ref name="history"/&gt; However, at least two other coins minted in every year in the interim still bore the motto,{{citation needed|date=August 2015}} including the [[Morgan dollar]] and the [[United States Seated Liberty coinage|Seated Liberty half dollar]]. The omission of the motto "In God We Trust" on the [[Indian Head eagle]] coin caused public outrage, and prompted [[United States Congress|Congress]] to pass a bill mandating its inclusion.  Mint Chief Engraver [[Charles E. Barber]] added the words and made minor modifications to the design. In 1908, Congress made it mandatory that the phrase be printed on all coins upon which it had previously appeared. This decision was motivated after a public outcry following the release of a $20 coin which did not bear the motto.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.republicanpresidents.net/10-interesting-facts-about-theodore-roosevelt/ |title=10 Interesting Facts About Theodore Roosevelt |publisher=Republicanpresidents.net |date= |accessdate=2014-02-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; The motto has been in continuous use on the one-cent coin since 1909, and on the ten-cent coin since 1916. It also has appeared on all gold coins and silver dollar coins, half-dollar coins, and quarter-dollar coins struck since July 1, 1908.&lt;ref name="history"/&gt; Since 1938, all US coins have borne the motto.&lt;ref name="USTreasury"/&gt;

==Society and culture==
===Religion===
In [[Judaism]] and [[Christianity]], the official motto "In God We Trust" resounds with several verses from the [[Bible]], including {{Bibleverse||Proverbs|3:5|KJV}}, {{Bibleverse||Psalm|118:8|KJV}}, {{Bibleverse||Psalm|40:3|KJV}}, {{Bibleverse||Psalm|73:28|KJV}}, and {{Bibleverse||Proverbs|29:25|KJV}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=In God We Trust: The Motto|url=http://www.allabouthistory.org/in-god-we-trust.htm|publisher=All About History|accessdate=2013-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Melkote Ramaswamy, a Hindu American scholar, writes that the presence of the phrase "In God We Trust" on American currency is a reminder that "there is God everywhere, whether we are conscious or not."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Ramaswamy |first=Melkote |url=http://www.indystar.com/article/20120811/LIFE04/208110323/In-Hinduism-there-just-one-God-many-forms |title=Faith/Values &amp;#124; Indianapolis Star |publisher=indystar.com |date=2012-08-11 |accessdate=2014-02-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141019115759/http://www.indystar.com/article/20120811/LIFE04/208110323/In-Hinduism-there-just-one-God-many-forms |archivedate=2014-10-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

*In the 1994 film ''[[Miracle on 34th Street (1994 film)|Miracle on 34th Street]]'', just as Henry is about to make his decision, Susan walks up to him with a Christmas card containing a $1 bill. On the back, the words "In God We Trust" are circled. He realizes that, since the U.S. Department of Treasury can put its official faith in God with no hard evidence, then the people can believe in Santa in the same way. Left with no choice, an elated Henry dismisses the case and declares that Santa is real, existing in the person of Kris.

==Criticism==
Advocates of [[Separation of church and state in the United States|separation of church and state]] have questioned the legality of this motto asserting that it is a violation of the United States Constitution, prohibiting the government from passing any law respecting an establishment of religion.&lt;ref name=Views&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vonnZcMHs8kC&amp;pg=PA60|title=The Dynamic Constitution: an Introduction to Americans Constitutional Law|author=Richard H.

Its use is of patriotic or ceremonial character and bears no true resemblance to a governmental sponsorship of a religious exercise."&lt;ref&gt;Aronow, 432 F.2d at 243.&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[Lynch v.

Mr. Justice Brewer in the ''Holy Trinity'' case, ''supra'', mentioned many of these evidences of religion, and Mr. Justice Douglas in the ''Zorach'' case referred to&amp;nbsp;...

To this list may be added tax exemption of churches, chaplaincies in the armed forces, the "Pray for Peace" postmark, the widespread observance of Christmas holidays, and, in classrooms, singing the fourth stanza of ''America'' which is prayer invoking the protection of God, and the words "in God is our trust" as found in the National Anthem, and the reciting of the Pledge of Allegiance to the Flag, modified by an Act of Congress of June 14, 1954, to include the words "under God.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2005, [[Michael Newdow]] announced he wants to have "In God We Trust" removed from [[Coins of the United States dollar|U.S. coins]] and [[Federal Reserve Note|banknotes]]. In 2004, he received the special Recognition Freethought Hero Award for his case to remove "In God We Trust"  from currency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ffrf.org/awards/special/2004_newdow.php |title=Freethought Hero Award 2004 – Mike Newdow |accessdate=2007-07-29 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070729192510/http://ffrf.org/awards/special/2004_newdow.php |archivedate=2007-07-29 |df= }}, [[Freedom From Religion Foundation]]  2004-10-30&lt;/ref&gt; In a November 14, 2005 interview with [[Fox News]]'s [[Neil Cavuto]], Newdow compared "In God We Trust" appearing on United States currency with [[racial segregation]] (specifically separate drinking fountains), saying, "How can you not compare those? What is the difference there? Both of them [whites and blacks] got equal water. They both had access. It was government saying that it's okay to separate out these two people on the basis of race. Here we're saying it's okay to separate two people on the basis of their religious beliefs."

In June 2006, a federal judge rejected Newdow's Establishment Clause lawsuit on the grounds that the minted words amount to a secular national slogan, and do not dictate anyone's beliefs. Newdow stated that he would appeal the ruling,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,199211,00.html | title=Federal Judge Nixes 'In God We Trust' Lawsuit | publisher=[[Fox News Channel]] | date=2006-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; although it should be noted that ''[[Aronow v. United States]]'' was decided on the same grounds in the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit]] and the lower court was required to return the same ruling, likewise the Ninth Circuit does not traditionally overrule previous Ninth Circuit rulings.

On December 4, 2007, Newdow argued before a three-judge panel of the Ninth Circuit to remove both "under God" from the Pledge of Allegiance (''Roe v. Rio Linda Union School District''),{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}} and "In God We Trust" from United States currency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fl1.findlaw.com/news.findlaw.com/hdocs/docs/religion/newdowus91405opn.pdf|title=Newdow v.

In 2015, [[David F. Bauman]] dismissed a case against the [[Matawan-Aberdeen Regional School District]] brought by a student of the district and the [[American Humanist Association]] that argued that the phrase "under God" in the [[Pledge of Allegiance (United States)|Pledge of Allegiance]] created a climate of discrimination because it promoted religion, making non-believers "second-class citizens".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.northjersey.com/news/hearing-under-god-in-pledge-of-allegiance-does-not-violate-rights-of-atheist-students-nj-judge-rules-1.1332137|title=Hearing 'Under God' in Pledge of Allegiance does not violate rights of atheist students, NJ judge rules|author=Salvador Rizzo|work=NorthJersey.com|access-date=February 29, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/maureensullivan/2015/02/07/judge-refuses-to-kick-god-out-of-public-schools/#11e06914435f|title=Judge Refuses To Kick God Out Of Public Schools|date=February 7, 2015|work=Forbes|access-date=February 29, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He noted; "As a matter of historical tradition, the words 'under God' can no more be expunged from the national consciousness than the words 'In God We Trust' from every coin in the land, than the words 'so help me God' from every presidential oath since 1789, or than the prayer that has opened every congressional session of legislative business since 1787."

Aside from constitutional objections, President [[Theodore Roosevelt]] took issue with using the motto on coinage as he considered using God's name on money to be [[sacrilege]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1907/11/14/archives/roosevelt-dropped-in-god-we-trust-president-says-such-a-motto-on.html|title=ROOSEVELT DROPPED 'IN GOD WE TRUST'; President Says Such a Motto on Coin Is Irreverence, Close to Sacrilege.

In September 2014, a proposal to add displays of "In God We Trust" on public property in [[Ballwin, Missouri]] was defeated following a plea to a meeting of aldermen by a local atheist.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.riverfronttimes.com/newsblog/2014/09/24/ballwin-rejects-in-god-we-trust-sign-after-atheist-mothers-passionate-plea-video&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.stltoday.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/ballwin-rejects-in-god-we-trust-sign/article_ed39ceaf-242c-509d-aed6-1f9892489ae3.html&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Christopher Houston Carson''' (December 24, 1809&amp;nbsp;– May 23, 1868), better known as '''Kit Carson''', was an American [[frontiersman]]. He was a [[mountain man]] ([[North American fur trade|fur trapper]]), wilderness guide, [[Indian agent]], and [[United States Army|U.S. Army]] officer. Carson became a frontier legend in his own lifetime via biographies and news articles. Often exaggerated, versions of his exploits were the subject of [[dime novel]]s. His understated nature belied confirmed reports of his fearlessness, combat skills, tenacity, and profound effect on the westward expansion of the United States.

Carson left home in rural present-day [[Missouri]] at age 16 to become a mountain man and [[Animal trapping|trapper]] in the West. In the 1830s, he accompanied [[Ewing Young]] on an expedition to [[Alta California|Mexican California]] and joined fur-trapping expeditions into the [[Rocky Mountains]]. He lived among and married into the [[Arapaho]] and [[Cheyenne]] tribes.

In the 1840s, Carson was hired as a guide by [[John C. Frémont]]. Frémont's expeditions covered much of [[California]], [[Oregon]], and the [[Great Basin]] area. Frémont mapped and wrote reports and commentaries on the [[Oregon Trail]] to assist and encourage westward-bound [[American pioneers]]. Carson achieved national fame through Frémont's accounts of his expeditions. Under Frémont's command, Carson participated in the [[Conquest of California|conquest]] of [[Centralist Republic of Mexico|Mexican]] California at the beginning of the [[Mexican–American War]]. Later in the war, Carson was a scout and courier, celebrated for his rescue mission after the [[Battle of San Pasqual]] and for his coast-to-coast journey from California to [[Washington, D.C.]] to deliver news of the conflict in California to the U.S. government. In the 1850s, he was appointed as the [[Indian agent]] to the [[Ute Indians]] and the [[Jicarilla]] Apaches.

During the [[American Civil War]], Carson led a regiment of mostly Hispanic volunteers from [[New Mexico]] on the side of the [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] at the [[Battle of Valverde]] in 1862. When the Confederate threat to New Mexico was eliminated, Carson led forces to suppress the [[Navajo people|Navajo]], [[Mescalero]] Apache, and the [[Kiowa]] and [[Comanche]] peoples by destroying their food sources.

Carson was [[brevet (military)|brevetted]] a [[Brigadier General]] and took command of [[Fort Garland, Colorado]]. He was there only briefly: poor health forced him to retire from military life. Carson was married three times and had ten children. The Carson home was in [[Taos, New Mexico]]. Carson died at [[Fort Lyon, Colorado]], of an [[aortic aneurysm]] on May 23, 1868. He is buried in [[Taos, New Mexico]], next to his third wife, Josefa Jaramillo.

== Early life (1809–1829) ==

[[File:Early photo of Kit Carson.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1|alt=Kit Carson wearing a beaver hat|Early photograph (possibly the first) of Kit Carson wearing a beaver hat.]]

Carson was born in [[Kentucky]] on [[Christmas Eve]], 1809. His parents were Lindsay (or Lindsey) Carson and his second wife, Rebecca Robinson. Lindsay had had five children by his first wife Lucy Bradley, and ten more children by Rebecca. Kit was their sixth, making him the eleventh of Lindsay's offspring.&lt;ref name=Roberts1&gt;Roberts 54–55&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Guild and Carter 3&lt;/ref&gt;

Lindsay Carson had a Scots-Irish [[Presbyterianism|Presbyterian]] background.&lt;ref name=Sides1&gt;Sides 8–9&lt;/ref&gt; He was a farmer, a cabin builder, and a [[veteran]] of the [[American Revolutionary War]] and the [[War of 1812]].&lt;ref name=Roberts1 /&gt; He fought Indians on the American frontier, losing two fingers on his left hand in a battle with the Fox and Sauk Indians.&lt;ref name=Sides1 /&gt;

The Carson family moved to Boone's Lick, [[Howard County, Missouri]], when Kit was about one year old. The family settled on a tract of land owned by the sons of [[Daniel Boone]], who had purchased the land from the Spanish. The Boone and Carson families became good friends, working and socializing together, and intermarrying. Lindsay's oldest son William married Boone's grand-niece, Millie Boone, in 1810. Their daughter Adaline became Kit's favorite playmate.&lt;ref&gt;Guild and Carter 9&lt;/ref&gt;

Missouri was then the frontier of American expansionism west; cabins were "forted" with tall stockade fences to defend against Indian attacks. As men worked in the fields, sentries were posted with weapons, to protect the farmers. These men were ready to kill any Indian who attacked.&lt;ref name=Roberts1 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Sides1 /&gt; Carson wrote in his ''Memoirs'': "For two or three years after our arrival, we had to remain forted and it was necessary to have men stationed at the extremities of the fields for the protection of those that were laboring."&lt;ref name=Roberts1 /&gt;

In 1818 Lindsay Carson died instantly when a tree limb fell on him while he was clearing a field. Kit was about 8 years old. Despite being penniless, his mother took care of her children alone for four years. She then married Joseph Martin, a widower with several children.&lt;ref&gt;Guild and Carter 10&lt;/ref&gt; Kit was a young teenager at the time and did not get along with his stepfather. The decision was made to apprentice him to David Workman, a saddler in [[Franklin, Missouri]]. Kit wrote in his ''Memoirs'' that Workman was "a good man, and I often recall the kind treatment I received."&lt;ref&gt;Guild and Carter 15&lt;/ref&gt;

Franklin was situated at the eastern end of the [[Santa Fe Trail]], which had opened two years earlier. Many of the customers at the saddle shop were trappers and traders, from whom Carson heard stirring tales of the West. Carson found work in the saddlery not to his taste: he once stated "the business did not suit me, and I concluded to leave".&lt;ref&gt;Carter 38–39&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Santa Fe Trail ===

In August 1826, against his mother's wishes, Kit ran away from his apprenticeship. He went west with a caravan of fur trappers, tending their livestock. They made their trek over the Santa Fe Trail to [[Santa Fe, New Mexico|Santa Fe]], the capital of [[Santa Fe de Nuevo México]], reaching their destination in November 1826. Kit settled in [[Taos, New Mexico|Taos]].&lt;ref&gt;Guild and Carter 27&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Roberts2&gt;Roberts 56–57&lt;/ref&gt;

Carson lived with [[Mathew Kinkead]], a trapper and explorer who had served with Carson's older brothers during the War of 1812.&lt;ref name=Carter2&gt;Carter 42–50.&lt;/ref&gt; Carson was mentored by Kinkead in learning the skills of a trapper, while learning the necessary languages for trade. Eventually he became fluent in Spanish and several Indian languages.

Workman put an advertisement in a local newspaper back in Missouri. He wrote that he would give a one cent [[Bounty (reward)|reward]] to anyone who brought the boy back to Franklin. No one claimed the reward. It was a bit of a joke, but Carson was free.&lt;ref name=Roberts2 /&gt; The advertisement featured the first printed description of Carson: "Christopher Carson, a boy about 16 years old, small of his age, but thick set; light hair, ran away from the subscriber, living in Franklin, Howard county, Missouri, to whom he had been bound to learn the saddler's trade."&lt;ref name=Roberts2 /&gt;

Between 1827 and 1829, Carson worked as cook, translator, and wagon driver in the southwest. He also worked at a copper mine near the [[Gila River]] in southwestern [[New Mexico]].&lt;ref&gt;Sides 14&lt;/ref&gt; In later life, Carson never mentioned any women from his youth. There are only three specific women mentioned in his writing: Josefa Jaramillo, his third and last wife; a comrade's mother in [[Washington, DC]]; and Mrs. Ann White, a victim of Indian atrocities.&lt;ref&gt;Guild and Carter 26&lt;/ref&gt;

== Mountain man (1829–1841) ==
{{See also|Fur trade}}
[[File:Carson and his horse Apache.jpg|thumb|upright=1|alt=Mountain man Kit Carson and his favorite horse|Mountain man Kit Carson and his favorite horse, Apache, from ''The Life and Adventures of Kit Carson, the Nestor of the Rocky Mountains'' by De Witt C. Peters. The book was Carson's first biography, and was printed in 1858.]]
At the age of nineteen, Carson began his career as a mountain man. He traveled through many parts of the American West with famous [[mountain men]] like [[Jim Bridger]] and [[Old Bill Williams]]. He spent the winter of 1828–1829 as a cook for [[Ewing Young]] in Taos.&lt;ref&gt;Guild and Carter 32&lt;/ref&gt; He joined Young's trapping expedition of 1829. The leadership of Young and the experience of the venture are credited with shaping Carson's early life in the mountains.

During August 1829 the party went into [[Apache]] country along the [[Gila River]]. The expedition was attacked, being Carson's first experience of combat. Young's party continued on into [[Alta California]] trapping and trading in California from [[Sacramento]] in the north to [[Los Angeles]] in the south, returning to Taos, New Mexico in April 1830 after trapping along the [[Colorado River]].&lt;ref&gt;Carter 42–50&lt;/ref&gt;

Carson joined a wagon train rescue party after entering Taos, and although the perpetrators had fled the scene of atrocities Young had the opportunity to witness Carson's horsemanship and courage. Carson joined another expedition led by Thomas Fitzpatrick and William Levin in 1831. Fitzpatrick, Levin and his trappers went north to the central [[Rocky Mountains]]. Carson would hunt and trap in the West for about ten years. He was known as a reliable man and a good fighter.&lt;ref&gt;Guild and Carter 48&lt;/ref&gt;

Life for Carson as a mountain man was not easy. After collecting beavers from traps, he had to hold onto them for months at a time until the annual [[Rocky Mountain Rendezvous]],&lt;ref&gt;Sides 15&lt;/ref&gt; held in remote areas of the West like the banks of the Green River in [[Wyoming]]. With the money received for the pelts, necessities of an independent life including [[fish hook]]s, [[flour]] and [[tobacco]] were procured. As there was little to no medical access in the varied regions he worked in, Carson had to dress his wounds and nurse himself.&lt;ref&gt;Cleland 44&lt;/ref&gt; Conflict with particular Indians sometimes occurred.&lt;ref&gt;Cleland 40–41&lt;/ref&gt; Carson's primary clothing at the time was in deer skins that had stiffened after being left outdoors for a time. This suit offered some protection against particular weapons employed by Indians.&lt;ref&gt;Cleland 21&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Grizzly bear]]s were one of the mountain man's greatest enemies.&lt;ref&gt;Cleland 43&lt;/ref&gt; A particular incident involving the animals happened to Carson in 1834 as he was hunting an elk alone. Two bears crossed paths with him and quickly chased him up a tree. One of the bears tried to make him fall by shaking the tree, but was not successful and eventually went away. Carson returned to his camp as fast as he could. He wrote in his ''Memoirs'' that: "[The bear] finally concluded to leave, of which I was heartily pleased, never having been so scared in my life."&lt;ref name="Roberts 80"&gt;Roberts 80&lt;/ref&gt;

The last rendezvous was held in 1840.&lt;ref&gt;Sides 33–34&lt;/ref&gt; At that time, the fur trade began to drop off. Fashionable men in [[London]], [[Paris]], and [[New York City|New York]] wanted [[silk]] hats instead of beaver hats. In addition, beaver populations across [[North America]] were declining rapidly from over-exploitation. Carson knew it was time to find other work. He wrote in his ''Memoirs'' that "Beaver was getting scarce, it became necessary to try our hand at something else."

In 1841, he was hired at [[Bent's Fort]] in [[Colorado]], at the largest building on the Santa Fe Trail. Hundreds of people worked or lived there. Carson hunted buffalo, antelope, deer, and other animals to feed these people. He was paid one dollar a day. He returned to Bent's Fort several times during his life to again provide meat for the fort's residents.&lt;ref name="Roberts 99-101"&gt;Roberts 99–101&lt;/ref&gt;

== Indian fighter ==

Carson was nineteen when he set off with Ewing Young's expedition to the Rocky Mountains in 1829. In addition to furs and the company of free-spirited, rugged mountain men, Carson sought action and adventure. He found what he was looking for in killing and [[scalping]] Indians. Carson probably killed and took the scalp of his first Indian when he was nineteen years old, during Ewing Young's expedition.&lt;ref&gt;Sides 16&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Jim Bridger.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Jim Bridger|Jim Bridger.]]
Carson's ''Memoirs'' are replete with stories about hostile Indian encounters with the memoirist. In January 1833, for example, warriors of the Crow tribe stole nine horses from Carson's camp. Carson and two other men sprayed the Crow camp with gunfire, killing almost every Crow. Carson wrote in his ''Memoirs'': "During our pursuit for the lost animals, we suffered considerably but, the success of having recovered our horses and sending many a redskin to his long home, our sufferings were soon forgotten."&lt;ref&gt;Roberts 82&lt;/ref&gt;

Carson viewed the Blackfoot nation as a hostile tribe, believing they posed the greatest threat to his livelihood, safety, and life. He hated the Blackfeet, and killed them at every opportunity. Historian David Roberts has written: "It was taken for granted that the Blackfeet were bad Indians; to shoot them whenever he could was a mountain man's instinct and duty."&lt;ref&gt;Roberts 85&lt;/ref&gt;

Carson had several encounters with the Blackfeet. His last battle with the Blackfeet took place in spring 1838. He was traveling with about one hundred mountain men led by [[Jim Bridger]]. In Montana territory, the group found a teepee with three Indian corpses inside. These three had died of [[smallpox]]. Bridger wanted to move on, but Carson and the other young men wanted to kill the Blackfeet.&lt;ref name="Roberts 87-88"&gt;Roberts 87–88&lt;/ref&gt;

They found the Blackfoot village and killed ten Blackfeet warriors. The Blackfeet found some safety in a pile of rocks but were driven away. It is not known how many Blackfeet died in this incident. Historian David Roberts writes: "[I]f anything like pity filled Carson's breast as, in his twenty-ninth year, he beheld the ravaged camp of the Blackfeet, he did not bother to remember it." Carson wrote in his ''Memoirs'' that this battle was "the prettiest fight I ever saw."&lt;ref name="Roberts 87-88" /&gt;

Carson's notions about Indians softened over the years. He found himself more and more in their company as he grew older. His notions about Indians became more understanding and more humane. He urged the government to set aside lands called reservations for their use. As an Indian agent, he saw to it that those under his watch were treated with honesty, fairness, and clothed and fed properly. Historian David Roberts believes his first marriage to an Arapaho woman named Singing Grass "softened the stern and pragmatic mountaineer's opportunism."&lt;ref name="Roberts 80" /&gt;

== Expeditions with John Charles Frémont (1842–1848) ==

[[File:J c fremont.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|left|alt=John Charles Frémont|[[John Charles Frémont]], the photographer and date are unknown.]]

In April 1842, Carson went back to his childhood home in Missouri to put his daughter Adaline in the care of relatives.&lt;ref name="Roberts 99-101" /&gt; On the return trip, Carson met [[John C. Frémont]] aboard a steamboat on the [[Missouri River]]. Frémont was a United States Army officer in the [[Corps of Topographical Engineers]]. He was about to lead an expedition into the West. After a brief conversation, Frémont hired Carson as a guide at $100 a month. It was the best-paying job of Carson's life.&lt;ref&gt;Roberts 123&lt;/ref&gt; Frémont wrote, "I was pleased with him and his manner of address at this first meeting. He was a man of medium height, broad-shouldered, and deep-chested, with a clear steady blue eye and frank speech and address; quiet and unassuming."&lt;ref&gt;Roberts 102–103&lt;/ref&gt;

=== First expedition, 1842 ===

In 1842, Carson guided Frémont across the [[Oregon Trail]] to [[South Pass, Wyoming]]. This was their first expedition into the West together. The purpose of this expedition was to map and describe the Oregon Trail as far as South Pass. A guidebook, maps, and other paraphernalia would be printed for westward-bound migrants and settlers. After the five-month, trouble-free mission was accomplished, Frémont wrote his government reports. These reports made Carson's name known across the United States, and spurred a migration of settlers westward to Oregon via the Oregon Trail.&lt;ref&gt;Sides 50–53&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Second expedition, 1843 ===

In 1843, Carson agreed to join Frémont's second expedition. He guided Frémont across part of the Oregon Trail to the [[Columbia River]] in Oregon. The purpose of the expedition was to map and describe the Oregon Trail from South Pass, Wyoming to the Columbia River. They also side-tripped to [[Great Salt Lake]] in [[Utah]], using a rubber raft to navigate the waters.&lt;ref&gt;Roberts 130&lt;/ref&gt; On the way to California, the party suffered from bad weather in the [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierra Nevada Mountains]], but were saved by Carson's good judgement and his skills as a guide. They found American settlers who fed them. The expedition then headed to California. This was illegal and dangerous because California was Mexican territory. The Mexican government ordered Frémont to leave. Frémont finally went back to Washington, D.C. The government liked his reports, but ignored his illegal trip into Mexico. Frémont was made a captain. The newspapers nicknamed him "The Pathfinder".&lt;ref&gt;Sides 59–61&lt;/ref&gt;

During this expedition, Frémont trekked into the [[Mojave Desert]]. His party met a Mexican man and boy. The two told Carson that Native Americans had [[ambush]]ed their party of travelers. The male travelers were killed; the women travelers were staked to the ground, sexually mutilated, and killed. The murderers then stole the Mexicans' thirty horses. Carson and a mountain man friend named [[Alexis Godey]] went after the murderers. They took two days to find them. They rushed into their camp, killing and scalping two of the murderers. The stolen horses were recovered and returned to the Mexican man and boy. This deed brought Carson even greater fame. It confirmed his [[Social status|status]] as a western hero in the eyes of the American people.&lt;ref&gt;Sides 62–64&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Third expedition, 1845 ===
{{Refimprove section|date=April 2015}}

In 1845, Carson guided Frémont on their third and last expedition.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.historynet.com/kit-carson-the-legendary-frontiersman-remains-an-american-hero.htm|title=Kit Carson: The Legendary Frontiersman Remains an American Hero|last=Reidhead|first=S.J.|date=2006-06-12|website=HistoryNet.com|language=en-US|access-date=2017-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; They went to California and Oregon. Frémont made scientific plans, but the expedition appeared to be political in nature. Frémont may have been working under secret government orders. President Polk wanted the province of Alta California for the United States. Once in California, Frémont started to rouse the American settlers into a patriotic fervor. The Mexican government ordered him to leave. Frémont went north to Oregon, though not before instigating the [[Sacramento River massacre]], in which at least 150 Indians were killed in an unprovoked attack. The party moved up along the Sacramento River, continuing to kill Indians as they went, then camped near [[Klamath Lake]]. Messages from Washington, DC made it clear that President Polk wanted California.

At Klamath Lake in southern Oregon, Frémont's party was hit in a revenge attack by 15–20 Indians on the night of May 9, 1846. Two or three men in camp were killed. The attackers fled after a brief struggle. Carson was angry that his friends had been killed. He took an axe and avenged the death of his friends by chopping away at a dead Indian's face. Frémont wrote, "He knocked his head to pieces."&lt;ref&gt;Sides 78–81&lt;/ref&gt;

In retaliation for the attack, a few days later Frémont's party massacred a village of Klamath people along the Williamson River in the [[Klamath Lake massacre]].&lt;ref name=Couture&gt;Amy Couture. [http://archive.ijpr.org/Feature.asp?FeatureID=1705 ''Captain John C. Fremont Clashes With Klamath Indians''], Jefferson Public Radio, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; The entire village was razed and at least 14 men, women and children were killed. There was no evidence that the village in question had anything to do with the previous attack.

=== Bear Flag Revolt ===
In June 1846, Frémont and Carson both participated in a California uprising against Mexico called the [[Bear Flag Revolt]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Mexico ordered all Americans to leave California. They did not want to go, and declared California an independent [[republic]]. American settlers in California wanted to be free of the Mexican government. The Americans found courage to oppose Mexico because they had Frémont and his troops behind them. Frémont wrote an oath of [[allegiance]]. He and his men were able to give some protection to the Americans. He ordered Carson to execute an old Mexican man named [[José de los Reyes Berreyesa]] and his two adult nephews. These three were captured when they stepped ashore at [[San Francisco Bay]]. They were executed to keep them from taking reports to Mexico about the uprising.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|jstor=25613577|title=Kit Carson in California: With Extracts from His Own Story|first=Charles L.|last=Camp|date=May 1, 2018|publisher=|journal=California Historical Society Quarterly|volume=1|issue=2|pages=111–151|accessdate=|doi=10.2307/25613577}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Frémont worked hard to win California for the United States. Fremont for a time fashioned himself as its military governor, until being replaced by General Kearney, who out-ranked him.&lt;ref&gt;Sherman, W.T., Memoirs&lt;/ref&gt; Carson took military records to the [[Secretary of War]] in Washington, DC. Frémont wrote, "This was a service of great trust and honor ... and great danger also." In 1847 and 1848, Carson made two quick trips to Washington, DC with messages and reports. In 1848, he took news of the California Gold Strike to the nation's capitol.

==1853==

In July 1853, Carson was in northern Nevada, with 7,000 sheep from Santa Fe. He was taking them to settlers in northern California, and southern Oregon. Carson had with him six "Spaniards" (possibly [[Basque Americans#Migration and shepherding|Basque]]s) to herd the sheep.&lt;ref name="diary"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Beeson |first1=Welborn |editor1-first=Bert |editor1-last=Webber |title=The Oregon &amp; Applegate Trail Diary of Welborn Beeson in 1853 |edition=Second |year=1993 |publisher=Webb Research Group |location=Medford, Oregon |isbn=0-936738-21-9 |pages=80 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Books and dime novels (1847–1859) ==

Carson's fame spread throughout the United States with government reports, dime novels, newspaper accounts, and word of mouth. The dime novels celebrated Carson's adventures, but were usually colored with exaggeration. A factual biography was attempted by DeWitt C. Peters in 1859, but has been criticized for inaccuracies and exaggerations. Carson became the hero of [[children's literature|juvenile fiction]] not just in the United States, but also published in French, German, Portuguese, Gujarati, Hindi, Singhalese, Arabic and Japanese.

=== Dime novels ===

[[File:Fighting Trapper, or Kit Carson to the Rescue.jpg|thumb|upright=1|alt=dime novel with Carson's picture|An 1874 dime novel with Carson's picture on the cover.]]

The first story about Carson's adventures was printed in 1847. It was called ''An Adventure of Kit Carson: A Tale of the Sacramento''. It was printed in ''Holden's Dollar Magazine''. Other stories were also printed, such as ''Kit Carson: The Prince of the Goldhunters'' and ''The Prairie Flower''. Writers thought Carson the perfect mountain man and Indian fighter. His exciting adventures were printed in the story ''Kiowa Charley, The White Mustanger; or, Rocky Mountain Kit's Last Scalp Hunt''. In this story, an older Kit is said to have "ridden into Sioux camps unattended and alone, had ridden out again, but with the scalps of their greatest warriors at his belt."&lt;ref&gt;Roberts 52, 79&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Indian captive Mrs. Ann White ===
{{Main|White Massacre}}

In 1849, Carson guided soldiers on the trail of Mrs. Ann White and her baby daughter. They had been captured by Apaches. No one paid attention to Carson's advice about a rescue attempt, and Mrs. White was found dead with an arrow in her heart. She had been horribly abused, and may have been raped. Her child had been carried away, and was never found.

A soldier in the rescue party wrote: "Mrs. White was a frail, delicate, and very beautiful woman, but having undergone such usage as she suffered nothing but a wreck remained; it was literally covered with blows and scratches. Her countenance even after death indicated a hopeless creature. Over her corpse, we swore vengeance upon her persecutors."

Carson discovered a book about himself in the Apache camp. This was the first time that he found himself in print. He was the hero of adventure stories. He was sorry for the rest of his life that Mrs. White had been killed. He wrote in his ''Memoirs'': "In camp was found a book, the first of the kind I had ever seen, in which I was made a great hero, slaying Indians by the hundreds ... I have often thought that Mrs. White read the same ... [and prayed] for my appearance that she might be saved."&lt;ref&gt;Sides 258–259&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Memoirs ===

In 1856, Carson told his life story to someone who wrote it down. This book is called ''Memoirs''. The [[manuscript]] was lost when taken East to find a professional writer who would work it into a book. [[Washington Irving]] was asked, but declined. The lost manuscript was found in a trunk in [[Paris]] in 1905. It was later printed. The first [[biography]] of Carson was written by DeWitt C. Peters in 1859. The book was called ''Kit Carson, the Nestor of the Mountains, from Facts Narrated by Himself''. When the book was read to Carson he said, "Peters laid it on a leetle too thick."&lt;ref&gt;Roberts 253–254&lt;/ref&gt;

== Mexican–American War (1846–1848) ==
{{See also|Mexican–American War}}

Lasting from 1846 to 1848, the [[Mexican–American War]] was an armed conflict between the United States and Mexico. At war's end, Mexico was forced to sell the territories of [[Alta California]] and [[New Mexico]] to the United States under The [[Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo]].

One of Carson's best known adventures took place during this war. In December 1846, Carson was ordered by General [[Stephen W. Kearny]] to guide him and his troops from [[Socorro, New Mexico]] to [[San Diego, California]]. Mexican soldiers attacked Kearny and his men near the village of [[San Pasqual Valley, San Diego|San Pasqual, California]].

Kearny was outnumbered. He knew he could not win; he ordered his men to take cover on a small hill. On the night of December 8, Carson, a naval lieutenant named Beale, and an Indian scout left Kearny to bring reinforcements from San Diego, {{convert|25|mi|km}} away. Carson and the lieutenant removed their shoes because they made too much noise, and walked barefoot through the desert. Carson wrote in his ''Memoirs'': "Finally got through, but had the misfortune to lose our shoes. Had to travel over a country covered with prickly pear and rocks, barefoot."&lt;ref&gt;Sides 163&lt;/ref&gt;

By December 10, Kearny believed reinforcements would not arrive. He planned to break through the Mexican lines the next morning, but 200 mounted American soldiers arrived in San Pasqual late that night. They swept the area, driving the Mexicans away. Kearny was in San Diego on December 12.&lt;ref&gt;Sides 164–165&lt;/ref&gt;

== Military career (1861–1868) ==

In April 1861, the [[American Civil War]] broke out. Carson left his job as an Indian agent and joined the Union Army as a [[lieutenant]]. He led the 1st New Mexico Volunteer Infantry and trained the new men. In October 1861, he was made a [[colonel]]. The Volunteers fought the [[Confederate States of America|Confederate forces]] in the [[Battle of Valverde]] in New Mexico, in February 1862. The Confederates won this battle but were later defeated in June and retreated to Texas.

=== Campaign against the Apaches ===
[[File:James Henry Carleton.jpg|thumb|upright=1|alt=|General James Henry Carleton]]

Once the Confederates were driven from New Mexico, Carson's commander Major General [[James Henry Carleton]] turned his attention to the Native Americans. Author and historian [[Edwin L. Sabin|Edwin Sabin]] writes that this officer had a "psychopathic hatred of the Apaches".&lt;ref&gt;Roberts 255&lt;/ref&gt; Carleton led his forces deep into the [[Mescalero]] Apache territory. The Mescaleros were tired of fighting and put themselves under Carson's protection. Carleton put these Apaches on a remote and lonely reservation on the [[Pecos River]].&lt;ref&gt;Roberts 257&lt;/ref&gt;

Carson disliked the Apaches as well. He wrote in a report that the Jicarilla Apaches "were truly the most degraded and troublesome Indians we have in our department ... [W]e daily witness them in a state of intoxication in our plaza."&lt;ref name="Roberts 258"&gt;Roberts 258&lt;/ref&gt; Carson half-heartedly supported Carleton's plans. He was tired and had suffered an injury two years before that gave him great trouble. He resigned from the Army in February 1863. Carleton refused to accept the resignation because he wanted Carson to lead a campaign against the Navajo.&lt;ref name="Roberts 258" /&gt;

=== Campaign against the Navajo ===
Carleton had chosen a bleak site on the Pecos River for his reservation, which was called Bosque Redondo (Round Grove). He chose this site for the Apaches and Navajos because it was far from white settlements. He also wanted these Apaches and Navajo to act as a buffer for any aggressive acts committed upon the white settlements from Kiowas and Comanches to the east of Bosque Redondo. He thought as well that the remoteness and desolation of the reservation would discourage white settlement.&lt;ref&gt;Roberts 259&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Hweeldi3.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|left|alt=Navajo at Fort Sumner|The Navajo at Fort Sumner, the end of The Long Walk.]]

The Mescalero Apaches walked {{convert|130|mi}} to the reservation. By March 1863, four hundred Apaches had settled around nearby Fort Sumner. Others had fled west to join fugitive bands of Apaches. By middle summer, many of these people were planting crops and doing other farm work.

On July 7, Carson, with little heart for the Navajo roundup, started the campaign against the tribe. His orders were almost the same as those for the Apache roundup: he was to shoot all males on sight and take the women and children captives. No peace treaties were to be made until all the Navajo were on the reservation.&lt;ref&gt;Roberts 260&lt;/ref&gt;

Carson searched far and wide for the Navajo. He found their homes, fields, animals, and orchards, but the Navajo were experts at disappearing quickly and hiding in their vast lands. The roundup proved frustrating for Carson. He was in his 50s, tired, and ill. By autumn 1863, Carson started to burn the Navajo homes and fields and remove their animals from the area. The Navajo would starve if this destruction continued. One hundred eighty-eight Navajo surrendered and were sent to Bosque Redondo. Life at the Bosque had turned grim; murders took place. The Apaches and Navajos fought. The water in the Pecos contained minerals that gave people cramps and stomach aches. Residents had to walk {{convert|12|mi}} to find firewood.&lt;ref&gt;Roberts 262&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Canyon de Chelly ===
{{Main|Battle of Canyon de Chelly}}

Carson wanted to take a winter break from the campaign. Major General Carleton refused, ordering him to invade the [[Canyon de Chelly]], where many Navajos had taken refuge. Historian David Roberts writes, "Carson's sweep through the Canyon de Chelly in the winter of 1863–1864 would prove to be the decisive action in the Campaign."&lt;ref&gt;Roberts 263&lt;/ref&gt;

The Canyon de Chelly was a sacred place for the Navajo. They believed that it would now be their strongest sanctuary. Three hundred Navajo took refuge on the canyon rim at a place called [[Fortress Rock]]. They resisted [[Battle of Canyon de Chelly|Carson's invasion]] by building rope ladders and bridges, lowering water pots into a stream, and keeping quiet and out of sight. These three hundred Navajo survived the invasion. In January 1864, Carson swept through the {{convert|35|mi|adj=on}} Canyon with his forces. The thousands of peach trees in the canyon were cut down. Few Navajo were killed or captured. Carson's invasion, however, proved to the Navajo that the [[United States]] could invade their country at any time. Many Navajo surrendered at [[Fort Canby]].&lt;ref&gt;Roberts 265–269&lt;/ref&gt;

By March 1864, there were 3,000 refugees at Fort Canby. An additional 5,000 arrived in the camp. They were suffering from the intense cold and hunger. Carson asked for supplies to feed and clothe them. The thousands of Navajo were led to [[Bosque Redondo]]. Many died along the way. Stragglers in the rear were shot and killed. In Navajo history, this horrific trek is known as [[Long Walk of the Navajo]]. By 1866, reports indicated that Bosque Redondo was a complete failure, and Major General Carleton was fired. Congress started investigations. In 1868, a treaty was signed, and the Navajo were allowed to return to their homeland. Bosque Redondo was closed.&lt;ref&gt;Roberts 270–281&lt;/ref&gt;

=== First Battle of Adobe Walls ===

On November 25, 1864, Carson led his forces against the southwestern tribes at the [[First Battle of Adobe Walls]] in the [[Texas]] panhandle. Adobe Walls was an abandoned trading post blown up by its inhabitants to prevent a take-over by hostile Indians. Combatants at the First Battle were the United States Army and Indian scouts against Kiowas, Comanches, and Plains Apaches. It was one of the largest engagements fought on the [[Great Plains]].

The battle was the result of General Carleton's belief that Indians were responsible for the continuing attacks on settlers along the Santa Fe Trail. He wanted to punish them and brought in Carson to do the job. With most of the Army engaged elsewhere during the American Civil War, the protection the settlers sought was almost nonexistent. Carson led 260 cavalry, 75 infantry, and 72 Ute and Jicarilla Apache Army scouts. In addition, he had two mountain howitzer cannons.&lt;ref name="Guild 255"&gt;Guild 255&lt;/ref&gt;

}}

On the morning of November 25, Carson discovered and attacked a Kiowa village of 176 lodges. After destroying this village, he moved forward to Adobe Walls. Carson found other Comanche villages in the area, and realized he would face a very large force of Native Americans. A Captain Pettis estimated that 1,200 to 1,400 Comanche and Kiowa began to assemble. That number would swell, according to some accounts, to an implausible 3,000.&lt;ref&gt;Kavanagh, Thomas W. ''The Comanches'' Lincoln: U of NE Press, 1999, pp. 472-473. In 1869, five years later, the total population of the three tribes was estimated to be 6,565, of which not more that one-fourth, or about 1,600, would be adult males. Plus, it is unlikely that all potential fighters were present nearby or participated.&lt;/ref&gt; Four to five hours of battle ensued. When Carson ran low on ammunition and howitzer shells, he ordered his men to retreat to a nearby Kiowa village. There they burned the village and many fine buffalo robes. His Indian scouts killed and mutilated four elderly and weak Kiowas.&lt;ref name="Guild 255" /&gt;

The retreat to New Mexico was then begun. There were few deaths among Carson's men. General Carleton wrote to Carson: "This brilliant affair adds another green leaf to the laurel wreath which you have so nobly won in the service of your country." &lt;ref name="Guild 255" /&gt;

== Personal life ==

In 1847, General [[William Tecumseh Sherman]] met Kit Carson in [[Monterey]], [[California]]. Sherman wrote: "His fame was then at its height, ... and I was very anxious to see a man who had achieved such feats of daring among the wild animals of the Rocky Mountains, and still wilder Indians of the plains ... I cannot express my surprise at beholding such a small, stoop-shouldered man, with reddish hair, freckled face, soft blue eyes, and nothing to indicate extraordinary courage or daring. He spoke but little and answered questions in monosyllables."

Colonel [[Edward W. Wynkoop]] wrote: "Kit Carson was five feet five and one half-inches tall, weighed about 140 pounds, of nervy, iron temperament, squarely built, slightly bow-legged, and those members apparently too short for his body. But, his head and face made up for all the imperfections of the rest of his person. His head was large and well-shaped with yellow straight hair, worn long, falling on his shoulders. His face was fair and smooth as a woman's with high cheekbones, straight nose, a mouth with a firm, but somewhat sad expression, a keen, deep-set but beautiful, mild blue eye, which could become terrible under some circumstances, and like the warning of the rattlesnake, gave notice of attack. Though quick-sighted, he was slow and soft of speech, and posed great natural modesty."

Lieutenant George Douglas Brewerton made one coast-to-coast dispatch-carrying trip to Washington, D.C. with Carson. Brewerton wrote: "The Kit Carson of my ''imagination'' was over six feet high&amp;nbsp;— a sort of modern Hercules in his build&amp;nbsp;— with an enormous beard, and a voice like a roused lion ... The real Kit Carson I found to be a plain, simple ... man; rather below the medium height, with brown, curling hair, little or no beard, and a voice as soft and gentle as a woman's. In fact, the hero of a hundred desperate encounters, whose life had been mostly spent amid wilderness, where the white man is almost unknown, was one of Dame Nature's gentleman ..."&lt;ref&gt;Roberts 187&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Freemasonry ===

Carson joined Freemasonry in the Santa Fe Territory of New Mexico petitioning in Montezuma Lodge No. 101. He was initiated an Entered Apprentice on April 22, 1854, passed to the degree of Fellowcraft June 17, 1854, and raised to the sublime degree of Master Mason December 26, 1854,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://mastermason.com/Millennium382/Papers/KitCarson.pdf|title=Christopher Houston "Kit" Carson|last=Brunton, 33rd|first=Grover W.|date=April 11, 2004|website=|publisher=|access-date=February 2, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; just two days after his forty-fifth birthday. Kit, together with several other Freemasons in Taos, petitioned to Charter Bent Lodge No. 204 (now Bent Lodge # 42) from the Grand Lodge of Missouri AF&amp;AM, a request which was granted on June 1, 1860, with Kit elected Junior Warden of the lodge.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.kitcarsonhomeandmuseum.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/GuideYoung.pdf|title=Meet Kit Carson: A guide for young people|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=The Kit Carson Home and Museum|access-date=February 2, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Masonic fraternity continued to serve him and his family, well after his death. In 1908, the Grand Lodge of New Mexico erected a wrought iron fence around his family burial plot.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.ca/books?id=IWARDgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT188&amp;dq=kit+carson+1908+grand+lodge&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiQotb4_KzeAhVpw1QKHXWKAugQ6AEIPzAE#v=onepage&amp;q=kit%20carson%201908%20grand%20lodge&amp;f=false ''199 Cemeteries to see before you die'']&lt;/ref&gt; The following year, the Grand Lodge challenged Bent Lodge to purchase and preserve Kit's home.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.kitcarsonmuseum.org/the-house/acquisition/|title=Acquisition|newspaper=Kit Carson Home and Museum|access-date=2017-02-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; More than a century later, the Kit Carson Home &amp; Museum is still managed by the lodge today.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://bentlodge42.org/|title=Bent Lodge No. 42 AF &amp; AM Taos, New Mexico USA|website=bentlodge42.org|access-date=2017-02-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Marriages ===

Carson was married three times. His first two wives were Native American. His third wife was Mexican. Carson was the father of ten children. He never wrote about his first two marriages in his ''Memoirs''. He may have thought he would be known as a "squaw man". Such men were not welcomed by polite society.&lt;ref&gt;Roberts 71&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1836, Carson met an Arapaho woman named Waanibe (Singing Grass, or Grass Singing) at a mountain man rendezvous held along the Green River in [[Wyoming]]. Singing Grass was a lovely young woman, and many mountain men were in love with her.&lt;ref&gt;Sides pp. 29–30.&lt;/ref&gt; Carson was forced to fight a duel with a French trapper named Chouinard for Waanibe's hand in marriage. Carson won, but he had a very narrow escape. The French trapper's bullet singed his hair. The duel was one of the best known stories about Carson in the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;Roberts 70&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Josefacarson02crop.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|alt=Josefa Carson|Josefa Carson, Carson's third and last wife. She holds Carson's son.]]

Carson married Singing Grass. She tended to his needs, and went with him on his trapping trips. They had a daughter named Adaline (or Adeline). Singing Grass died after giving birth to Carson's second daughter, in about 1841. This second child did not live long: in 1843, she fell into a kettle of boiling soap in [[Taos, New Mexico]].&lt;ref&gt;Roberts 98&lt;/ref&gt;

Carson's life as a mountain man was too hard for a little girl so he took Adaline to live with his sister Mary Ann Carson Rubey in [[St. Louis]], Missouri. Adaline was taught in a school for girls called a seminary. Carson brought her West when she was a teenager. She married a George Stilts of St. Louis, and divorced. In 1858, she went to the California goldfields. Adaline died in 1860&lt;ref&gt;Roberts 101–102&lt;/ref&gt; or after 1862, probably in [[Mono County, California]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Kit Carson &amp; His Three Wives: A Family History|author=Marc Simmons|publisher=UNM Press|date=2003 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=8M5iW1cYt7IC&amp;lpg=PA165&amp;dq=%22Adaline%20carson%22&amp;pg=PA165#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Adaline%20carson%22&amp;f=false|isbn=978-0-8263-3296-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1841, Carson married a Cheyenne woman named Making-Out-Road. They were together only a short time. Making-Out-Road divorced him in the way of her people by putting Adaline and all of Carson's property outside their tent. Making-Out-Road left Carson to travel with her people through the west.

About 1842, Carson met Josefa Jaramillo. She was the daughter of a wealthy and prominent Mexican couple living in Taos. In order to marry her, Carson left the [[Presbyterianism|Presbyterian]] Church for the [[Catholic Church]]. He married 14-year-old Josefa on February 6, 1843. They had eight children.

=== Illiteracy ===

Carson was illiterate. He was embarrassed by this, and tried to hide it.&lt;ref&gt;Sides 50–51&lt;/ref&gt; In 1856, he dictated his ''Memoirs'' to another and stated then:
"I was a young boy in the school house when the cry came, Injuns! I jumped to my rifle and threw down my spelling book, and thar it lies."&lt;ref&gt;''The Legendary Mountain Men of North America'' {{ISBN|978-1-312-92151-1}} p.87&lt;/ref&gt;

Carson enjoyed having other people read to him, and preferred the poetry of [[George Gordon, Lord Byron]]. Carson thought Sir [[Walter Scott]]'s long poem, ''[[The Lady of the Lake (poem)|The Lady of the Lake]]'' was "the finest expression of outdoor life."&lt;ref&gt;Roberts 186&lt;/ref&gt; Carson eventually learned to write "C. Carson", but it was very difficult for him. He made his mark on official papers, and this mark was then witnessed by a [[clerk]] or other official.&lt;ref&gt;Roberts 55&lt;/ref&gt;

==Final days==
[[File:FinalKitCarsonPhoto.jpg|upright|thumb|alt=The last known photograph of Carson|The last known photograph of Carson, taken around March 20, 1868, during Carson's visit to Boston with Ouray and Ute chiefs, two months before his death, by photographer James Wallace Black and signed by Carson. It is the largest extant photograph of him.]]

When the Civil War ended, and the Indian Wars campaigns were in a lull, Carson was appointed [[Brevet (military)|brevet]] brigadier general (dated March 13, 1865) and appointed commandant of [[Ft. Garland, Colorado]], in the heart of Ute country. Carson had many Ute friends in the area and assisted in government relations.&lt;ref&gt;[[#sabin|Sabin, 1914]], p. 468, 477-478&lt;/ref&gt;

After being [[muster (military)|mustered]] out of the Army, Carson took up ranching, settling at [[Boggsville]] in [[Bent County, Colorado|Bent County]]. In 1868, at the urging of Washington and the Commissioner of Indian Affairs, Carson journeyed to Washington D.C., where he escorted several Ute Chiefs to meet with the President of the United States to plead for assistance to their tribe.&lt;ref&gt;[[#sides|Sides, 2006]], p.487—488&lt;/ref&gt;

Soon after his return, his wife Josefa died from complications after giving birth to their eighth child. Her death was a crushing blow to Carson. He died a month later at age 58 on May 23, 1868, in the presence of Dr. Tilton and his friend Thomas Boggs in the surgeon's quarters at [[Fort Lyon]], Colorado. His last words were "Goodbye, friends. ''Adios, compadres''". The cause of his death was [[abdominal aortic aneurysm]]. His resting place is Taos, New Mexico.&lt;ref&gt;[[#sides|Sides, 2006]], p.482-483&lt;/ref&gt;

== Legacy ==

[[File:KitCarson-FrederickWilliamMacMonnies-BMA.jpg|thumb|upright=1|left|alt=Kit Carson bronze statue|Kit Carson bronze statue by [[Frederick William MacMonnies]], 1906.]]

Carson's home in Taos, New Mexico is today a museum called the [[Kit Carson House|Kit Carson Home and Museum]]. A monument was raised in the plaza at Santa Fe by the New Mexico Grand Army. In Denver, a statue of a mounted Kit Carson can be found atop the Mac Monnies Pioneer Monument. Another equestrian statue can be seen in [[Trinidad, Colorado]]. [[Carson National Forest]] in New Mexico was named for him, as well as [[Kit Carson County, Colorado|a county]] and [[Kit Carson, Colorado|a town]] in Colorado. A river in [[Nevada]] is named for Carson as well as the state's capital, [[Carson City]]. Fort Carson, an army training post near Colorado Springs, was named for him during [[World War II]] by popular vote of the men training there.&lt;ref&gt;Guild 283–284&lt;/ref&gt; [[Kit Carson Park]] in [[Escondido, California]] is named for him.

Carson has been widely depicted in film and television series. In 1966, the actor [[Phillip Pine]] played Carson with [[Michael Pate]] as fellow Fremont scout Frenchy Godey in the episode "Samaritans, Mountain Style" of the [[Television syndication|syndicated]] series, ''[[Death Valley Days]]'', hosted by [[Robert Taylor (actor)|Robert Taylor]]. In the story line, Carson and Godey stop to help a settler in dire straits.

In the 1960s and 1970s, Carson came under the scrutiny of contemporary historians, and ideas regarding his historical legacy began to change. Earlier accounts portrayed Carson as an American hero, but in scholarship of this period he became an arch-villain in the military campaigns against the Indians. In 1992, for example, a young professor at [[Colorado College]] was successful in demanding that a period photograph of Carson be removed from the [[ROTC]] office. In 1992, a tourist told a journalist at the Carson home in Taos, "I will not go into the home of that racist, genocidal killer." In the 1970s, a Navajo at a trading post said, "No one here will talk about Kit Carson. He was a butcher." In 1993, a symposium was organized to air various views on Carson, but the Navajo spokespeople refused to attend.&lt;ref&gt;Roberts 292–295&lt;/ref&gt;

Over time, historical analysis of Carson shifted again. David Roberts writes, "Carson's trajectory, over three and a half decades, from thoughtless killer of Apaches and Blackfeet to defender and champion of the Utes, marks him out as one of the few frontiersmen whose change of heart toward the Indians, born not of missionary theory but of first hand experience, can serve as an exemplar for the more enlightened policies that sporadically gained the day in the twentieth century."&lt;ref&gt;Roberts 294&lt;/ref&gt;

== Media portrayals ==

[[Harry Carey (actor)|Harry Carey]] played Carson in the 1936 film ''[[Sutter's Gold]]''.

[[Jon Hall (actor)|Jon Hall]] played Carson in the 1940 [[Western (genre)|Western]] film ''[[Kit Carson (film)|Kit Carson]]''.

[[Rip Torn]] played Carson in the 1986 [[miniseries]] ''[[Dream West]]''.

Carson was the inspiration for a same named character in the popular Italian comic book series ''[[Tex Willer]]''.

== Reputation ==
Carson's contributions to western history have been reexamined by historians, journalists and Indian activists since the 1960s. In 1968, Carson biographer Harvey L. Carter stated:

{{quote|In respect to his actual exploits and his actual character, however, Carson was not overrated. If history has to single out one person from among the Mountain Men to receive the admiration of later generations, Carson is the best choice. He had far more of the good qualities and fewer of the bad qualities than anyone else in that varied lot of individuals.&lt;ref&gt;Carter 210&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Some journalists and authors during the last 25 years presented an alternative view of Kit Carson. For instance, [[Virginia Hopkins]] stated in 1988 that "Kit Carson was directly or indirectly responsible for the deaths of thousands of Indians".&lt;ref&gt;Hopkins 40&lt;/ref&gt;

Historian [[Hampton Sides]] said that Carson believed the Native Americans needed reservations as a way of physically separating and shielding them from white hostility and white culture. He is said to have viewed the raids on white settlements as driven by desperation, "committed from absolute necessity when in a starving condition." Indian hunting grounds were disappearing as waves of white settlers filled the region.&lt;ref&gt;Sides 334&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014 there was a petition to rename Kit Carson Park in Taos, NM Red Willow Park. Despite the support of the [[Taos Pueblo]] and the residents of Taos Valley the park was not renamed and still bears the Kit Carson moniker.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2014/07/03/not-so-fast-kit-carson-park-taos-nm-might-not-be-renamed-155628|title=Not So Fast: Kit Carson Park in Taos, NM, Might NOT Be Renamed|last=jrobertson|date=July 3, 2014|website=Indian Country Today Media Network.com|access-date=October 7, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Charles Dickens 3.jpg|thumb]]

'''The letters of [[Charles Dickens]]''', of which more than 14,000 are known, range in date from about 1821, when Dickens was 9 years old, to 8 June 1870, the day before he died.{{sfn|Easson|2011|p=335}}  They have been described as "invariably idiosyncratic, exuberant, vivid, and amusing…widely recognized as a significant body of work in themselves, part of the Dickens canon".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.themorgan.org/blog/charles-dickenss-letters |title=Charles Dickens's Letters |last=Kiely |first=Declan |date=10 November 2011 |publisher=The Morgan Library &amp; Museum |access-date=3 November 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  They were written to family, friends, and the contributors to his literary periodicals, who included many of the leading writers of the day.  Their letters to him were almost all burned by Dickens because of his horror at the thought of his private correspondence being laid open to public scrutiny.  The reference edition of Dickens's letters is the 12-volume Pilgrim Edition, edited by Graham Storey ''et al.'' and published by [[Oxford University Press]].

==Dickens as a letter-writer==
[[File:Charles Dickens Autograph.jpg|thumb|Dickens's signature from a letter, incorporating his personal flourish]]

[[Charles Dickens|Dickens]] received, by his own count, 60 to 80 letters every day, and when pressure of work permitted he replied to them without delay.{{sfn|Hartley|2012|p=viii}}  For most of his life he did not employ a secretary but conducted his correspondence himself.  Exceptions were made for begging letters, which his sister-in-law [[Georgina Hogarth]] answered, and for routine business connected with his two magazines, ''[[Household Words]]'' and ''[[All the Year Round]]'', which was handled by his assistant editor [[William Henry Wills (journalist)|W. H. Wills]], although Dickens preferred to correspond with the contributors himself.{{sfn|Hartley|2012|p=xiv}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Pearson |first1=Hesketh |author-link1=Hesketh Pearson |year=1949 |title=Dickens |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=KP4NAQAAMAAJ&amp;q=%22explanation+and+advice+to+his+contributors%22&amp;dq=%22explanation+and+advice+to+his+contributors%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiIgJeBt5jXAhUCElAKHXy6CdQQ6AEIJjAA |location=London |publisher=Four Square |page=180 |access-date=3 November 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  He wrote with a goose quill rather than a steel pen, and at first used black ink (now aged to brown), switching in the late 1840s to blue ink on blue paper.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.themorgan.org/collection/A-Letter-from-Charles-Dickens |title=A Letter from Charles Dickens |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=n.d. |publisher=The Morgan Library &amp; Museum |access-date=3 November 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  His biographer [[Percy Hetherington Fitzgerald|Fitzgerald]] described his handwriting as "so 'prompt', so alert, finished and full of purpose and decision; legible also, but requiring familiarity and training to read".  He often ended his signature with an exuberant flourish, which became a kind of trademark.{{sfn|Hartley|2012|pp=xv-xvi}}

==His correspondents==

Dickens's correspondents spanned the whole social scale of 19th century England from reformed street prostitutes to [[Queen Victoria]] herself.  They included family members, of course, and Dickens's publishers; writers like [[Robert Browning]], [[Thomas Carlyle]], [[Wilkie Collins]], [[George Eliot]], [[John Forster (biographer)|John Forster]], [[Alfred, Lord Tennyson|Alfred Tennyson]] (not yet ennobled), and [[William Makepeace Thackeray]]; the artists [[Clarkson Frederick Stanfield|Clarkson Stanfield]] and [[Daniel Maclise]]; and the actor [[William Macready]].  Letters to several of his friends have little or no representation in the surviving correspondence because they were destroyed by the recipients, their heirs, or by random accidents of history.  These correspondents include his daughter [[Kate Perugini|Katey]], [[Augustus Egg]], [[Chauncy Hare Townshend]], [[Hablot Knight Browne|Hablot K. Browne ("Phiz")]], [[Richard Barham]], [[James Muspratt]], and his lover [[Ellen Ternan]].{{sfn|Hartley|2012|pp=xii-xiii, xix}}{{sfn|Paroissien|2008|p=35}}

==Subject matter==

The letters are the only extended autobiographical writing by Dickens that has survived.  Attempts at writing a diary seldom lasted long and for the most part the manuscripts are lost, while a memoir of his childhood was discontinued and converted into some of the early chapters of ''[[David Copperfield]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Collins |first1=Philip |chapter=Diaries and Autobiography of Dickens |editor1-last=Schlicke |editor1-first=Paul |title=The Oxford Comapnion to Charles Dickens: Anniversary Edition |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=AYCcAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA158&amp;dq=%22diaries+are+mentioned+in+letters%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwitsaS8xaXXAhVO3KQKHcf4BakQ6AEIJjAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22diaries%20are%20mentioned%20in%20letters%22&amp;f=false |location=Oxford |publisher=Oxford University Press |page=158 |isbn=9780199640188 |access-date=4 November 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The letters therefore give the most immediate and vivid expression of Dickens's life as seen by himself, even though they rarely examine his interior life.{{sfn|Hartley|2012|pp=viii-ix, xi}}  They give a unique insight into the way Dickens's processes of composition worked as he wrestled with the novels we know and considered others which were never written, such as the "book whereof the whole story shall be on the top of the [[Great St Bernard Pass|Great St. Bernard]]".{{sfn|Hartley|2012|p=x}}  Dickens's almost constant travelling is also reflected.  [[George Gissing]] wrote that "If he makes a tour in any part of the British Isles, he writes a full description of all he sees, of everything that happens, and writes it with such gusto, such mirth, such strokes of fine picturing, as appear in no other private letters ever given to the public."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Gissing |first1=George |year=1898 |title=Charles Dickens: A Critical Study |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=ZWg6AQAAMAAJ&amp;q=%22gusto+such+mirth%22&amp;dq=%22gusto+such+mirth%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjYgc_Dx6XXAhXN26QKHcrYD9g4FBDoAQgrMAE |location=London |publisher=Blackie |page=235 |access-date=4 November 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The range of subject-matter of the letters is described by his editor, Jenny Hartley:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Scotland, Paris, and Venice…child exploitation, [[Ragged school|Ragged Schools]], and soup kitchens…[[the Great Exhibition]], women smoking, and dresses for reformed prostitutes…ravens, waistcoats, and recipes for punch…[[Animal magnetism|mesmerism]] and dreams…terrible acting and wonderful children's birthday parties".{{sfn|Hartley|2012|p=xx}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Manuscripts==

Dickens's early sensational success as the author of ''[[The Pickwick Papers]]'' induced many people to keep any letters he might send them.  This, along with his huge output of letters, ensured that many thousands have survived.{{sfn|Easson|2011|p=335}}{{sfn|Paroissien|2008|p=35}}  In 1965 the editors of his letters reckoned them to number nearly 12,000; by 2002 they had amended the total to 14,252.{{sfn|House|Storey|1965|p=xxxiv}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |year=2002 |editor1-last=Storey |editor1-first=Graham |title=The Letters of Charles Dickens.

In contrast, few letters to Dickens are known.  Dickens often expressed his opposition to the publication of private letters, and was determined to suffer from it himself as little as possible.  He burned those letters that had been sent to him in a mass bonfire in 1860, commenting, "Would to God that every letter I had ever written was on that pile".  He burned more in 1869, the year before he died.{{sfn|Easson|2011|p=336}}{{sfn|Paroissien|2008|p=34}}  As a result, hardly more than 250 letters to Dickens have survived to the present day.{{sfn|House|Storey|1965|p=xxx}}

==Editions==
[[File:Lettre de Dickens à Angela Burdett-Coutts.jpg|thumb|A letter to [[Angela Burdett-Coutts]], written from the [[Champs-Élysées]], Paris in 1856]]

The reading public's first chance to study large numbers of Dickens letters came shortly after his death with the publication of ''The Life of Charles Dickens'' (1872–74) by his lifelong friend John Forster.  Many of Dickens's letters to Forster were included, but they were heavily and rather dishonestly edited to make Forster seem a more central figure in Dickens's life than he had always been.{{sfn|House|Storey|1965|pp=xi-xvii}}

In 1878 it was announced that a collection of Dickens's letters would be edited by his sister-in-law, Georgina Hogarth.  In collaboration with Dickens's eldest daughter [[Mary Dickens|Mary]] she duly produced ''The Letters of Charles Dickens'' in three volumes, which were published by [[Chapman &amp; Hall]] between 1880 and 1882.  A second edition in two volumes followed in 1882, and a third in one volume, published by [[Macmillan Publishers|Macmillan]], in 1893. Altogether they included roughly a thousand letters, many were heavily cut for reasons of taste, and some were created by cut-and-pasting together extracts from several different letters in a way which was considered unacceptable even by late-Victorian standards.{{sfn|House|Storey|1965|p=ix-x}}

1938 saw the publication in three volumes of almost 6,000 of the letters, edited by Walter Dexter as part of the Nonesuch Edition of Dickens's Works.{{sfn|House|Storey|1965|p=xvii}}  This was an expensively-priced edition limited to 877 copies, and was therefore not easily accessible to the ordinary reader unless he had either ample means or access to a university library.  Moreover, Dexter's editorial practices were far from rigorous: there was hardly any annotation, and many of the letters were simply copied from previous editions rather than from the originals, with the inevitable result that the texts were not always accurate.{{sfn|Paroissien|1985|p=xii}}{{sfn|Easson|2011|p=337}}

In 1949 the publisher [[Rupert Hart-Davis]] set a new edition in motion, with a grant of £6000 from the [[Pilgrim Trust]] and the Dickens scholar Humphry House in place as editor.  In 1955, with almost 10,000 letters transcribed, House died unexpectedly.  His widow Madeline House took over the project in collaboration with the critic [[Graham Hough]], though Graham Storey soon took over Hough's role.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |year=1985 |editor1-last=Hart-Davis |editor1-first=Rupert |title=The Lyttelton Hart-Davis Letters.

The editorial team changed over the years, with Madeline House, Graham Storey, Kathleen Tillotson, K. J. Fielding, Nina Burgis and Angus Easson all being named as editor at various points.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://copac.jisc.ac.uk/id/34284786?style=html&amp;title=letters%20of%20Charles%20Dickens |title=Copac catalogue entry |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |website=Copac |access-date=4 November 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[British Academy]] took over the financing of the project, and from 1995 it was renamed the British Academy – Pilgrim Trust Edition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |year=1998 |editor1-last=Storey |editor1-first=Graham |title=The Letters of Charles Dickens.

Not all of the originals of these letters can be found; some are printed from short extracts in sale catalogues and similar sources, and some are only known from mentions of their existence in other letters.{{sfn|Hartley|2012|p=viii}}  Dickens's biographer [[Claire Tomalin]] reported that "Each volume of this edition wins acclaim as it appears, and it is right that it should do so";&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://copac.jisc.ac.uk/id/14338634?style=html&amp;title=letters%20of%20Charles%20Dickens |title=Copac catalogue entry |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |website=Copac |access-date=4 November 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; one such critic thought that "it brings Dickens so close you can almost smell the cigar smoke".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.f.waseda.jp/vicky/students/help/mistakes/almost-ex.html |title=Examples of ''almost'' |last=Muehleisen |first=Victoria |publisher=Waseda University |access-date=4 November 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Dissenting voices have been few, and though Joel J. Brattin noted that there were some errors and omissions of transcription he endorsed it as being in general extremely accurate, and thought the project as a whole "of incomparable value".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Brattin |first1=Joel J. |year=2011 |orig-year=1999 |chapter=Criticism and Scholarship |editor1-last=Schlicke |editor1-first=Paul |title=The Oxford Companion to Charles Dickens: Anniversary Edition |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=AYCcAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA146&amp;dq=%22despite+some+errors+and+omissions%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiK5o_f9KXXAhVLyKQKHXL8AI0Q6AEIRzAG#v=onepage&amp;q=%22despite%20some%20errors%20and%20omissions%22&amp;f=false |location=Oxford |publisher=Oxford University Press |pages=146–147 |isbn=9780199640188 |access-date=4 November 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

New Dickens letters are discovered at the rate of about 20 per year, and they were for some years edited and published in Supplements to the Pilgrim Edition in ''The Dickensian'', the journal of the [[Dickens Fellowship]].  They have also been made accessible online by the Charles Dickens Letters Project, and it is intended eventually to publish a supplementary volume to the Pilgrim Edition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://pure.qub.ac.uk/portal/files/34843306/Supplement_1.pdf |title=The Letters of Charles Dickens: Supplement – I |last=Easson |first=Angus |website=The Charles Dickens Letters Project |publisher=Queen's University Belfast |access-date=4 November 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://pure.qub.ac.uk/portal/files/34843324/Supplement_19.pdf |title=The Letters of Charles Dickens: Supplement XIX |last1=Easson |first1=Angus |last2=Litvack |first2=Leon |last3=Brown |first3=Margaret |last4=Dicks |first4=Joan |website=The Charles Dickens Letters Project |publisher=Queen's University Belfast |access-date=4 November 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dickensletters.com |title=The Charles Dickens Letters Project |last=Litvack |first=Leon |publisher=Dickens Fellowship |access-date=4 November 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Selections==

The costliness of both the Nonesuch and Pilgrim volumes, and the fragmentary or routine business nature of many of the letters included, has encouraged the publication of selections of Dickens's letters, intended for the general reader rather than the scholar.  In 1985 David Paroissien edited ''The Selected Letters of Charles Dickens'', taking his texts from the Nonesuch Edition, substantive textual variants from the first five volumes of the Pilgrim Edition (the only ones then published) being listed in the notes.{{sfn|Paroissien|1985|pp=x-xii}}  The scholar [[John Espey]] wrote that this selection constitutes "a full review of almost all that we know of Dickens' activities as editor, public figure, father, husband, lecturer and lover", and that it "should satisfy for some time both the general reader and the specialist".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Espey |first1=John |date=23 February 1986 |title=Selected Letters of Charles Dickens: Edited and Arranged by David Paroissien |url=http://articles.latimes.com/1986-02-23/books/bk-10839_1_david-paroissien |journal=Los Angeles Times |access-date=5 November 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, Dickens's bicentenary year, Jenny Hartley edited a one-volume selection from the Pilgrim Edition.  [[Claire Harman (writer)|Claire Harman]], writing in the ''[[The Times Literary Supplement|Times Literary Supplement]]'', welcomed it with enthusiasm, while noting the sparse annotation and the fact that Hartley had chosen a representative selection of the letters, including a few rather trivial ones, rather than "a series of epistolary knock-out blows".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Harman |first1=Claire |date=8 February 2012 |title=What an Amazing Man! |url=https://www.the-tls.co.uk/articles/public/charles-dickens-letters-amazing-man/ |journal=Times Literary Supplement |access-date=5 November 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Boyd Tonkin, in the ''[[The Independent|Independent]]'', found it to be "edited with unobtrusive intelligence and insight",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Tonkin |first1=Boyd |date=3 February 2012 |title=The Selected Letters of Charles Dickens, Edited by Jenny Hartley |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/books/reviews/the-selected-letters-of-charles-dickens-edited-by-jenny-hartley-6298396.html |journal=The Independent |access-date=5 November 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Joyce Carol Oates]] thought it "more revealing and more intimate than any biography",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Oates |first1=Joyce Carol |date=16 August 2012 |title=The Mystery of Charles Dickens |url=http://www.nybooks.com/articles/2012/08/16/mystery-charles-dickens/ |journal=The New York Review of Books |access-date=5 November 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the critic [[Nicholas Lezard]] recommended it in the ''[[The Guardian|Guardian]]'' with the words, "The whole book bursts with the author’s energy, and you will love him and know him better after reading even a few of these letters."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Lezard |first1=Nicholas |date=14 July 2015 |title=The Selected Letters of Charles Dickens: Review – The Man Behind the Novels |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/jul/14/selected-letters-charles-dickens-review |journal=The Guardian |access-date=5 November 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in 2012, a 4-hour audiobook was issued by [[Naxos Records|Naxos]] under the title ''Charles Dickens: A Portrait in Letters'', the readers being David Timson and [[Simon Callow]].  One reviewer wrote that they "create myriad personalities with varying accents, tones, class distinctions, and personal idiosyncrasies that are nearly flawless".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.audiofilemagazine.com/reviews/read/77105/charles-dickens-a-portrait-in-letters-by-charles-dickens/ |title=[Review] |author=S.

'''Lochtegate''' is a name of a scandal involving United States swim team members [[Ryan Lochte]], [[Jimmy Feigen]], [[Gunnar Bentz]], and [[Jack Conger]] during the [[2016 Summer Olympics]] held in [[Rio de Janeiro]], Brazil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Alex Butler|title=#LochteGate: Gunnar Bentz gives statement, says Ryan Lochte damaged gas station|url=http://www.upi.com/Sports_News/2016/08/20/LochteGate-Gunnar-Bentz-gives-statement-says-Ryan-Lochte-damaged-gas-station/7371471712215|website=UPI.com|publisher=UPI|accessdate=August 25, 2016|date=August 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Scott Eric Kaufman |title=#LochteGate explained: Everything we know about U.S. Olympic swimmers alleged robbery, so far|url=http://www.salon.com/2016/08/18/lochtegate-explained-everything-we-know-about-u-s-olympic-swimmers-alleged-robbery-so-far/|website=Salon.com|publisher=Salon|accessdate=August 25, 2016|date=August 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="time"&gt;{{cite news|author1=Cady Lang|title=These Are the Best Memes of the 2016 Rio Olympics|url=http://time.com/4456849/rio-2016-best-olympics-memes/|website=Time.com|publisher=Time|accessdate=August 25, 2016|date=August 19, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Billy Bush on Lochtegate: I played ‘devil’s advocate’ to Al Roker in debate|url=http://www.today.com/video/billy-bush-on-lochtegate-i-played-devil-s-advocate-to-al-roker-in-debate-748473923884|website=Today.com|publisher=Today|accessdate=August 25, 2016|date=August 22, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=#Lochtegate|url=http://www.msnbc.com/all-in/watch/lochtegate-746993731763|website=MSNBC.com|publisher=NBC|accessdate=August 25, 2016|date=August 18, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; While initial news stories reported that Lochte and three other US swimmers had been robbed at gunpoint after a night out in Rio, later details emerged that the "armed robbers posing as police" were actually security guards at a gas station where the swimmers had urinated outside the bathroom and Lochte vandalized a framed poster, and ended with the swimmers providing money to the guards. Some of the swimmers were detained in Brazil as witnesses. Two of the swimmers told police that Lochte's story had been fabricated.

Ultimately, the athletes each released statements, and one swimmer paid a fine of approximately $10,800 to a Brazilian charity in order to get his passport back. Lochte apologized for lying about the gas station dispute, and for overshadowing the ongoing Olympic games.&lt;ref name="WGN"&gt;{{cite web|author1=Erik Runge|title=Lochte apologies for lying about Rio incident: `I`m so sorry`|url=https://wgntv.com/2016/08/19/ryan-lochte-posts-apology-on-instagram-i-am-so-sorry/|website=WGNtv.com|publisher=WGN |accessdate=August 30, 2018|date=August 19, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Three days later, Lochte lost all four of his commercial sponsors.

Lochte was charged in Brazil with falsely reporting a crime.  The scandal gained significant media attention and "embarrassed the host city, angered the police and government and dominated news coverage of South America's first Olympics."&lt;ref name="reuters"&gt;{{cite web|author1=Cassandra Garrison|author2=Caroline Stauffer|title=Two U.S. swimmers land in Miami after Olympic Committee apology|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-olympics-rio-lochte-idUSKCN10U109|website=reuters.com|publisher=Reuters |accessdate=August 26, 2016|date=August 19, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2017 the court in Brazil dismissed the charges against Lochte, because his false claims were "made to a broadcaster and not to police."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.com/sport/swimming/40623647 Ryan Lochte: Court dismisses robbery claim charges against US swimmer].

On August 26, when asked about whether the US would consider a request from Brazil to [[extradite]] Lochte, White house press secretary [[Josh Earnest]] replied "the United States will certainly adhere to the terms of any extradition treaty that we’ve signed with any country in the world.  Obviously, as we’ve discussed in a very different context, we remain committed to following those guidelines assiduously, and allowing the guidelines of those treaties and the law here in the United States to guide those discussions and to guide those decisions.

During an appearance on ''[[Good Morning America]]'' on August 30, 2016, Lochte said his claim of being held up at gunpoint was a "very big mistake," but regarding the ensuing scandal, "I think it's everyone blowing this way out of proportion. I think that's what happened."  Regarding his claim that a gun was held to his head, he stated, "Like I said, I did lie about that one part." and that it was made while still intoxicated the next day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/ryan-lochte-made-mistake-rio-robbery-claim-moving/story?id=41738959 |title=Ryan Lochte Made a 'Very Big Mistake' in Rio Robbery Claim, Moving Forward on 'Dancing With the Stars' - ABC News |publisher=Abcnews.go.com |date= |accessdate=2016-08-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lochte's attorney, Jeffrey M.

After Bentz returned to the United States, he released a statement August 19 about the incident. He started by stating "I want to offer a sincere apology to the United States Olympic Committee, USA Swimming, the extraordinary women and men of Team USA, and the University of Georgia." He continued with "While I am anxious to put this matter behind me and rejoin my Georgia teammates in classes, practices and competitions, I feel compelled to stress several key points. 1. I was never a suspect in the case from the beginning (Brazilian law enforcement officials saw me only as a witness). 2.

After Conger returned to the United States, he issued a statement on August 19, 2016, in which he stated "Let me begin by emphasizing that I have been completely truthful in my statements throughout this unfortunate situation, including the information I provided to US officials before leaving Brazil. In fact, the Brazilian authorities made clear to me from the very beginning that I was being considered only a witness, not a suspect." He apologized by saying "we pulled into a gas station to use the restroom, but ultimately relieved ourselves outside, for which I apologize."&lt;ref name="stmt"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/statement-from-gold-medal-olympic-swimmer-jack-conger-300316139.html |title= Statement From Gold Medal Olympic Swimmer Jack Conger |date=August 20, 2016 |publisher=[[PR Newswire]] |access-date= August 20, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 18, [[U.S. Olympic Committee]] CEO Scott Blackmun apologized for the incident&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Bill Chappell Twitter |url=https://www.npr.org/sections/thetorch/2016/08/18/490572609/we-apologize-to-rio-and-brazil-u-s-olympic-committee-chief-says |title='We Apologize' To Rio And Brazil, U.S. Olympic Committee Chief Says : The Torch |publisher=NPR |date=2016-08-18 |accessdate=2016-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; On August 19, the International Olympic Committee created a disciplinary commission for the four swimmers, to investigate the matter and potentially sanction the athletes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aol.com/article/2016/08/19/cnn-lochte-will-be-suspended-by-usa-swimming-us-olympic-commit/21455277/ |title=IOC sets up disciplinary commission for four US swimmers |publisher=AOL |date= |accessdate=2016-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ansari |first=Azadeh |url=http://edition.cnn.com/2016/08/20/sport/us-olympics-swimmers-reported-robbery-future/ |title=Ryan Lochte: 'I over-exaggerated' Olympics robbery story - CNN.com |publisher=Edition.cnn.com |date=2016-08-22 |accessdate=2016-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On August 21, Blackmun stated that further action would occur involving the four, without commenting on specific disciplinary actions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.espn.com/olympics/summer/swimming/story/_/id/17359335/scott-blackmun-us-olympic-committee-ceo-says-ryan-lochte-fellow-swimmers-disciplined |title=Scott Blackmun, U.S. Olympic Committee CEO, says Ryan Lochte, fellow swimmers will be disciplined |publisher=Espn.com |date=2016-08-21 |accessdate=2016-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== United States suspensions ====
On September 8, both the U.S. Olympic Committee and USA Swimming suspended Lochte for 10 months and Bentz, Conger and Feigen for four months.&lt;ref name="punishment1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.espn.com/olympics/swimming/story/_/id/17493633/ryan-lochte-suspended-10-months-united-states-olympic-committee-usa-swimming |title=Ryan Lochte suspended 10 months by United States Olympic Committee, USA Swimming |publisher=Espn.com |date= |accessdate=2016-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Additionally, Lochte was required to complete 20 hours of community service and Bentz required to complete 10 hours.&lt;ref name="punishment1" /&gt;  All were made ineligible for financial support during their suspensions, removed from the U.S. Olympic delegation to the White House, barred from U.S. Olympic training centers, and blocked from attending USA Swimming's year-end Golden Goggles celebration.&lt;ref name="punishment1" /&gt;

Lochte's lawyer, Jeff Ostrow, declined to comment on the appropriateness of the sanctions, and reiterated that "Ryan did not commit a crime."&lt;ref name="punishment1" /&gt;  Conger stated, "I do not agree in any way with these sanctions," and maintained that all he did wrong was to urinate publicly at the gas station.&lt;ref name="punishment1" /&gt;

Blackmun's statement noted, "As we have said previously, the behavior of these athletes was not acceptable. It unfairly maligned our hosts and diverted attention away from the historic achievements of Team USA,"&lt;ref name="punishment2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.latimes.com/sports/sportsnow/la-sp-sn-swimmers-punished-20160908-snap-story.html |title=Ryan Lochte and three U.S. teammates receive penalties for lying about Rio robbery |publisher=LA Times |date= |accessdate=2016-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; and "Each of the athletes has accepted responsibility for his actions and accepted the appropriate sanctions."&lt;ref name="punishment1" /&gt; Chuck Wielgus of USA Swimming stated, "Unfortunately, this storyline took attention away from the athletes who deserved it the most" and "These [swimmers] took accountability for their mistakes and are committed to represent themselves and our country with the great character and distinction we expect."&lt;ref name="punishment2" /&gt;

==Early life==
Mahmoud Ahmadinejad was born on 28 October 1956 near [[Garmsar]], in the village of [[Aradan, Iran|Aradan]], in [[Semnan province]]. His mother, Khanom, was a [[Sayyid]]a, an [[honorific]] title given to those believed to be direct bloodline descendants of the Islamic prophet [[Muhammad]].&lt;ref name="bookref1"/&gt; His father, Ahmad, was a grocer and barber, and was a religious [[Shia Islam|Shia]] who taught the [[Quran]].&lt;ref name="bookref1"&gt;{{cite book|last=Melman|first=Yossi|first2=Meir |last2=Javedanfar|title=The Nuclear Sphinx of Tehran: Mahmoud Ahmadinejad and the State of Iran|publisher=Basic Books|year=2007|pages=1–3|isbn=9780786718870}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When Mahmoud was one year old, his family moved to [[Tehran]]. Mahmoud's father changed their [[family name]] from "Saborjhian"&lt;ref name=bioTait&gt;{{cite news|first=Robert |last=Tait|title=A humble beginning helped to form Iran's new hard man|newspaper=The Guardian|date=2 July 2005|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2005/jul/02/iran.roberttait|accessdate=27 July 2009 |location=Tehran}}&lt;/ref&gt; or "Sabaghian"{{efn|Kasra Naji says that the name was 'Sabaghian,' which means 'dye-masters' in [[Persian language|Persian]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Kasra|last=Naji|title=Ahmadinejad: The Secret History of Iran's Radical Leader|publisher=University of California Press |year=2008|isbn=9781845116361|page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} to Ahmadinejad in 1960 to avoid discrimination when the family moved to the city. ''Sabor'' is Persian for thread painter,{{efn|In 2009, some media reports claimed that Sabourjian is a common Iranian Jewish name, and that ''Sabor'' is the name for the Jewish [[tallit]] (prayer shawl) in Persia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=[[Daily Telegraph]]|date=3 October 2009|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/middleeast/iran/6256173/Mahmoud-Ahmadinejad-revealed-to-have-Jewish-past.html |title=Mahmoud Ahmadinejad revealed to have Jewish past}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Meir Javedanfar]], a blogger at ''The Guardian'', disputed this claim, citing experts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=5 October 2009|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2009/oct/05/mahmoud-ahmadinejad-jewish-family |title=Ahmadinejad has no Jewish roots|access-date=10 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} a once common occupation within the Semnan carpet industry. Ahmadinejad's uncle and his brother [[Davoud Ahmadinejad]] have confirmed that the previous surname was "Sabbaghian" ({{lang-fa|صباغیان}}).&lt;ref name=Sabbaghian /&gt; Ahmadinejad is a composite name: Ahmadi Nejad. Ahmad is to a name applied for Muhammad, the prophet of Islam, and namely virtuous. The suffix ''Nejad'' in Persian means race, therefore the term Ahmadi Nejad means "the race of Muhammad". According to the interviews with the relatives of Ahmadi Nejad, his father who works in small shop, sold his house in Tehran and bought a smaller one, giving the leftover to charity and poor people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first1=Anoushiravan|last1=Enteshami |first2=Mahjoob|last2=Zweiri |title=Iran and the rise of Neoconservatives, the politics of Tehran's silent Revolution|year=2007 |page=53|publisher=I. B. Tauris}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1976, Ahmadinejad took Iran's national university entrance examination. According to his autobiography, he was ranked 132nd out of 400,000 participants that year,&lt;ref name=EABBBC20060814 &gt;{{cite news|title=Iran's president launches weblog |publisher=BBC|date=14 August 2006|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/4790005.stm|accessdate=28 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and soon enrolled in the [[Iran University of Science and Technology]] (IUST), located at Tehran, as an undergraduate student of civil engineering. He would later earn his doctorate in 1997 in transportation engineering and planning from Iran University of Science and Technology as well, when he was the mayor of Ardabil Province, located at the north-west of the country.

==Administrative and academic careers==
Some details of Ahmadinejad's life during the 1980s are not publicly known, but it is known that he held a number of administrative posts in the province of [[West Azerbaijan]], [[Iran]].&lt;ref name=JLAnderson /&gt;

Many reports say that after [[Saddam Hussein]] ordered the invasion of Iran, Ahmadinejad joined the [[Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps]]&lt;ref name="bioGS" /&gt; and served in their intelligence and security apparatus,&lt;ref name="bioGS" /&gt; but his advisor Mojtaba Samareh Hashemi says, "He has never been a member or an official member of the Revolutionary Guards", having been a [[Basiji]]-like volunteer instead.&lt;ref name=EABFT20080530&gt;{{cite web| first=Najmeh |last=Bozorgmehr|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/3c04bcbc-2d9e-11dd-b92a-000077b07658,dwp_uuid=be75219e-940a-11da-82ea-0000779e2340.html?nclick_check=1|title=Interview transcript: Mojtaba Samareh-Hashemi|accessdate=28 July 2009|date=30 May 2008|work=[[Financial Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ahmadinejad was accepted to a [[Master of Science]] program at his alma mater in 1986. He joined the faculty there as a lecturer in 1989,&lt;ref name="bioIR" /&gt;&lt;ref name="bioSenate"&gt;{{cite web|first=Hussein D.|last=Hassan|title=Profile and Statements of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad|publisher=[[Library of Congress]]|date=16 January 2007|url=http://brownback.senate.gov/public/legissues/foreignpol_crsreportiranprofilestateofpres.pdf|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100106163238/http://brownback.senate.gov/public/legissues/foreignpol_crsreportiranprofilestateofpres.pdf|archivedate=6 January 2010 |accessdate=28 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1997 received his [[doctorate]] in civil engineering and traffic transportation planning.&lt;ref name="bioIR" /&gt;&lt;ref name="bioGS" /&gt;

==Early political career==
After the [[Islamic Revolution]], Ahmadinejad became a member of the [[Office for Strengthening Unity]],&lt;ref name="bioIC" /&gt; an organization developed to prevent students from sympathizing or allying with the budding [[People's Mujahedin of Iran|Mojahedin-e Khalq]].&lt;ref name="bioIC" /&gt;

He first took political office as unelected governor to both [[Maku, Iran|Maku]] and [[Khoy]] in [[West Azarbaijan Province]] during the 1980s.&lt;ref name="bioGS" /&gt; He eventually became an advisor to the governor general of [[Kurdistan province (Iran)|Kurdistan Province]] for two years.&lt;ref name="bioIR" /&gt;&lt;ref name="bioSenate" /&gt; During his doctoral studies at Tehran, he was appointed governor general of newly formed [[Ardabil Province]] from 1993 until [[Mohammad Khatami]] removed him in 1997,&lt;ref name="bioSenate" /&gt; whereupon he returned to teaching.&lt;ref name="bioGS" /&gt;

==Mayor of Tehran==
The 2003 mayoral race in Tehran elected [[conservative]] candidates from the [[Alliance of Builders of Islamic Iran]] to the [[City Council of Tehran]]. The Council appointed Ahmadinejad [[Mayor of Tehran|mayor]].&lt;ref name="bioGS" /&gt;

As mayor, he reversed changes made by previous [[moderate]] and [[reformism|reformist]] mayors. He put religious emphasis on the activities of cultural centres they had founded, publicised the separation of [[elevator]]s for men and women in the municipality offices,&lt;ref name="entekhab2006" /&gt; and suggested that people killed in the [[Iran–Iraq War]] be buried in major [[city square]]s of Tehran. He also worked to improve the traffic system and put an emphasis on [[Charity (virtue)|charity]], such as distributing free soup to the poor.

After his election to the presidency, Ahmadinejad's resignation as the Mayor of Tehran was accepted on 28 June 2005. After two years as mayor, Ahmadinejad was one of 65 finalists for [[World Mayor]] in 2005, selected from 550 nominees, only nine of them from Asia.&lt;ref name="world mayor" /&gt; He was among three strong candidates for the top-ten list, but his resignation made him ineligible.&lt;ref name="world mayor"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldmayor.com/results05/worldmayor_finalists05.html|title=The 2005 World Mayor finalists|publisher=World Mayor|accessdate=18 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of his goals was "putting the petroleum income on people's tables", meaning Iran's oil profits would be distributed among the poor.&lt;ref name=AT20060119&gt;{{cite news |first= S. |last= Moubayed|title=Iran and the art of crisis management|newspaper=Asia Times |date=19 January 2006|url=http://www.atimes.com/atimes/Middle_East/HA19Ak03.html|accessdate=28 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ahmadinejad announced controversial ministerial appointments for his second term. [[Esfandiar Rahim Mashaei]] was briefly appointed as first vice president, but opposed by a number of Majlis members and by the intelligence minister, [[Gholam-Hossein Mohseni-Eje'i]]. Mashaei followed orders to resign. Ahmadinejad then appointed Mashaei as chief of staff, and fired Mohseni-Eje'i.&lt;ref name=clashes727&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2009/jul/27/world/fg-iran27|title=Iran president clashes with conservatives|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=27 July 2009|accessdate=18 June 2011|first1=Borzou|last1=Daragahi|first2=Ramin |last2=Mostaghim}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 26 July 2009, Ahmadinejad's government faced a legal problem after he sacked four ministers. Iran's constitution (Article 136) stipulates that, if more than half of its members are replaced, the cabinet may not meet or act before the Majlis approves the revised membership.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Deshmukh|first=Jay |url=https://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5jYm2jkM3p-MmD8B1Oh9ZDxXNG6xw |title=Ahmadinejad 'sacks four Iran ministers'|publisher=Google|date=26 July 2009|accessdate=7 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The vice chairman of the Majlis announced that no cabinet meetings or decisions would be legal, pending such a re-approval.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://aftabnews.ir/vdchzinw.23nzmdftt2.html|title=آفتاب – باهنر: جلسات دولت نهم از این پس غیرقانونی است|work=Aftab News|accessdate=7 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[http://www.payvand.com/news/07/jan/1295.html "Ahmadinejad's Achilles Heel"]&lt;/ref&gt; Interest rates were cut by presidential decree to below the inflation rate. One unintended effect of this stimulation of the economy has been the bidding up of some urban real estate prices by two or three times their pre-Ahmadinejad value by Iranians seeking to invest surplus cash and finding few other safe opportunities. The resulting increase in the cost of housing hurt poorer, non-property owning Iranians, the putative beneficiaries of Ahmadinejad's populist policies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Letter from Tehran, The rationalist|first=Laura|last=Secor |page=31|work=The New Yorker|date=2 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Management and Planning Organisation, a state body charged with mapping out long-term economic and budget strategy, was broken up and its experienced managers were fired.&lt;ref name="donkey"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.newstatesman.com/economy/2008/09/iran-economic-ahmadinejad |title=Economics is for donkeys|work=New Statesman|date=11 September 2008|accessdate=21 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ahmadinejad publicly responded harshly to the letter and denounced the accusations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailystar.com.lb/Business/Middle-East/2006/Jun-16/72571-iranian-economists-lash-out-at-ahmadinejads-policies.ashx|title=Iranian economists lash out at Ahmadinejad's policies|newspaper=Daily Star|location=Libya|date=16 June 2006|accessdate=18 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/money/world/2006-09-04-iran-economy-usat_x.htm |title=Geopolitics casts pall on hobbled Iranian economy|date=5 September 2006|first=David J.|last=Lynch|location=Tehran|work=[[USA Today]]|access-date=26 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ahmadinejad called for "middle-of-the-road" compromises with respect to Western-oriented [[capitalism]] and [[socialism]].

President Ahmadinejad changed almost all of his economic ministers, including oil, industry and economy, since coming to power in 2005. In an interview with Fars News Agency on April 2008, [[Davoud Danesh Jaafari]] who acted as minister of economy in Ahmadinejad's cabinet, harshly criticized his economic policy: "During my time, there was no positive attitude towards previous experiences or experienced people and there was no plan for the future. Peripheral issues which were not of dire importance to the nation were given priority. Most of the scientific economic concepts like the effect of liquidity on inflation were put in question."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5jPjMFDWR5wix280l0R7irdv5THEg|title=Ahmadinejad slammed by outgoing economy minister|work=AFP|date=22 April 2008|accessdate=21 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response to these criticisms, Ahmadinejad accused his minister of not being "a man of justice" and declared that the solution to Iran's economic problem is "the culture of martyrdom".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5jelVVHDZfukEAiK80qF88B6Q1Tpg|title=Martyrdom would solve Iran's economic woes: Ahmadinejad|work=AFP|date=24 April 2008 |accessdate=21 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2008, the petroleum minister of Iran admitted that the government illegally invested 2 billion dollars to import petrol in 2007.

He also instituted cuts in the interest rates that private and public banking facilities could charge.&lt;ref name="InterestRates"/&gt;&lt;ref name="MPO"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.tehrantimes.com/index_View.asp?code=175959 |title=Assembly of Experts to study economic reform plan: Rafsanjani |accessdate=23 August 2008 |date=23 August 2008 |newspaper=Tehran Times |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080912183345/http://www.tehrantimes.com/index_View.asp?code=175959 |archivedate=12 September 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; He issued a directive that the [[Management and Planning Organisation of Iran|Management and Planning Organization]] be affiliated to the government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.payvand.com/news/06/oct/1192.html|title=Iran: Debate heats up over restructuring of Management and Planning Organization|accessdate=27 April 2009|date=18 October 2006|newspaper=Payvand}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2011, Ahmadinejad announced that he would temporarily run the Oil Ministry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2011/WORLD/meast/05/16/iran.ahmadinejad.oil/index.html?hpt=Sbin|work=CNN|title=Iran's leader taking over Oil Ministry temporarily, news agency says|date=16 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Family planning and population policy===
{{See also|Family planning in Iran}}

In October 2006, Ahmadinejad began calling for the scrapping of Iran's existing birth-control policies which discouraged Iranian couples from having more than two children. He told [[Member of Parliament|MPs]] that Iran could cope with 50 million more people than the current 70 million. In November 2010, he urged Iranians to marry and reproduce earlier: "We should take the age of marriage for boys to 20 and for girls to about 16 and 17."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/World/Middle-East/2010/1122/Ahmadinejad-calls-on-Iranian-girls-to-marry-at-16 |title=Ahmadinejad calls on Iranian girls to marry at 16|website=[[The Christian Science Monitor]]|first=Scott |last=Peterson|date=22 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; His remarks have drawn criticism and been called ill-judged at a time when Iran was struggling with surging inflation and rising unemployment, estimated at around 11%. Ahmadinejad's call was reminiscent of a call for Iranians to have more children made by Ayatollah [[Ruhollah Khomeini]] in 1979. The policy had increased Iran's population by 16 million in seven years&lt;ref name=RWDreams/&gt;{{rp|321}} but had eventually been reversed in response to the resultant economic strain.&lt;ref name="Guard-Child"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2006/oct/23/iran.roberttait |first=Robert|last=Tait|location=Tehran|date=23 October 2006|title=Ahmadinejad urges Iranian baby boom to challenge West|work=The Guardian|access-date=11 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, the government sent the "Family Protection Bill" to the Iranian parliament. Women's rights activists criticized the bill for removing protections from women, such as the requirement that a husband obtain his wife's consent before [[polygamy|marrying a second wife]]. Women's rights in Iran are more religiously based than those in secular countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/ebadi-protests-against-iran-s-polygamy-bill/article1-328872.aspx |title=Ebadi protests against Iran's polygamy bill|work=[[Hindustan Times]]|accessdate=21 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Housing===

The first legislation to emerge from his newly formed government was a 12 trillion [[Iranian rial|rial]] ([[US$]]1.3 billion) fund called ''"Reza's Compassion Fund"'',&lt;ref name=rooz06&gt;{{cite web|url=http://roozonline.com/01newsstory/012137.shtml|title="Reza's Compassion Fund" project archived|accessdate=17 October 2006|work=[[Rooz]]|language=fa |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061021113903/http://roozonline.com/01newsstory/012137.shtml|archivedate=21 October 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; named after [[Shi'a Islam|Shi'a]] [[Shi'a Imam|Imam]] [[Ali al-Rida]]. Ahmadinejad's government said this fund would tap Iran's oil revenues to help young people get jobs, afford marriage, and buy their own homes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://irannegah.com/Video.aspx?id=593 |title=Video of Imam Reza Love Fund|website=IranNegah.com |access-date=18 May 2008|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120306113836/http://irannegah.com/Video.aspx?id=593 |archivedate=6 March 2012 |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fund also sought charitable donations, with a [[trustee|board of trustees]] in each of Iran's 30 provinces. The legislation was a response to the cost of urban housing, which is pushing up the national average marital age (currently around 25 years for women and 28 years for men). In 2006 the Iranian parliament rejected the fund. However, Ahmadinejad ordered the administrative council to execute the plan.&lt;ref name=rooz06/&gt;

Responses to dissent have varied. Human Rights Watch writes that "the Ahmadinejad government, in a pronounced shift from the policy under former president Mohammed Khatami, has shown no tolerance for peaceful protests and gatherings." In December 2006, Ahmadinejad advised officials not to disturb students who engaged in a protest during a speech of his at the [[Amirkabir University of Technology]] in Tehran,&lt;ref name=Raja3739&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.rajanews.com/News/?3739 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080307115938/http://www.rajanews.com/News/?3739 |archivedate=7 March 2008|title=گزارش اختصاصي رجانيوز از حاشيه هاي مراسم امروز دانشگاه اميركبير|trans-title=Exclusive report from the margins of today's ceremony Amir Kabir University|website=Rajanews.com |date=7 March 2008 |deadurl=yes|language=Persian|access-date=11 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Raja3737 /&gt; although speakers at other protests have included among their complaints that there had been a crackdown on dissent at universities since Ahmadinejad was elected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Fathi|first=Nazila|url=http://www.deseretnews.com/article/650214386/Students-disrupt-speech-by-Iran-chief.html |title=Students disrupt speech by Iran chief|work=Deseret News|agency=The New York Times News Service |date=12 December 2006 |location=Tehran|access-date=12 December 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2007, the Tehran police, which is under Khamenei's supervision, began a crackdown on women with "improper [[hijab]]." This led to criticism from associates of Ahmadinejad.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.baztab.com/news/65372.php |title=

In 2006, Ahmadinejad's government applied a 50% [[Racial quota|quota]] for male students and 50% for female students in the university entrance exam for [[medicine]], [[dentistry]] and [[pharmacy]]. The plan was supposed to stop the growing presence of female students in the universities. In a response to critics, Iranian minister of health and medical education, [[Kamran Bagheri Lankarani]] argued that there are not enough facilities such as dormitories for female students.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} Masoud Salehi, president of Zahedan University said that presence of women generates some problems with transportation.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} Also, Ebrahim Mekaniki, president of [[Babol University of Medical Sciences]], stated that an increase in the presence of women will make it difficult to distribute facilities in a suitable manner.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} Bagher Larijani, the president of [[Tehran University of Medical Sciences]] made similar remarks.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} According to [[Rooz|Rooz Online]], the quotas lack a legal foundation and are justified as support for "family" and "religion."{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}

In response to the students' slogans, the president said: "We have been standing up to dictatorship so that no one will dare to establish dictatorship in a millennium even in the name of freedom.

===Nuclear program===

Ahmadinejad has been a vocal supporter of [[Nuclear program of Iran|Iran's nuclear program]], and has insisted that it is for peaceful purposes. He has repeatedly emphasized that building a [[nuclear weapon|nuclear bomb]] is not the policy of his government. He has said that such a policy is "illegal and against our religion."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/persian/iran/story/2006/01/060111_mj-ir-nuke-ahmadinejad.shtml "Ahamadinejad: We will reach the nuclear energy in near future."] [[BBC News]].

In April 2006, Ahmadinejad announced that Iran had successfully refined [[uranium]] to a stage suitable for the [[nuclear fuel cycle]]. In a speech to students and academics in [[Mashhad]], he was quoted as saying that Iran's conditions had changed completely as it had become a nuclear state and could talk to other states from that stand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.arabicnews.com/ansub/Daily/Day/060413/2006041301.html |title=Ahmadinejad: Iran can now talk to world from vantage point of a nuclear state |website=ArabicNews.com |access-date=29 October 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060422084214/http://www.arabicnews.com/ansub/Daily/Day/060413/2006041301.html |archivedate=22 April 2006 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 13 April 2006, Iran's news agency, [[Islamic Republic News Agency]] (IRNA), quoted Ahmadinejad as saying that the peaceful Iranian nuclear technology would not pose a threat to any party because "we want peace and stability and we will not cause injustice to anyone and at the same time we will not submit to injustice."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.upi.com/Business_News/Security-Industry/2006/04/13/AhmadinejadIran-nuke-right-non-negotiable/UPI-84261144938178/ |title=Ahmadinejad: Iran nuke right non-negotiable |publisher=UPI|date=13 April 2006 |access-date=12 June 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, Iran's nuclear policy under Ahmadinejad's administration has received much criticism, spearheaded by the United States and Israel. The accusations include that Iran is striving to obtain nuclear arms and developing long-range firing capabilities—and that Ahmadinejad issued an order to keep [[UN]] inspectors from freely visiting the nation's nuclear facilities and viewing their designs, in defiance of an [[IAEA]] resolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Ravid |first=Barak|url=http://www.haaretz.com/print-edition/news/sources-un-watchdog-hiding-evidence-on-iran-nuclear-program-1.282217 |title=Sources: UN watchdog hiding evidence on Iran nuclear program.|work=Haaretz|date=12 June 2011|accessdate=18 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/02/05/AR2006020500877.html |title=Nuclear Inspections Are Curbed by Iran |work=The Washington Post |first=Ali Akbar |last=Dareini |agency=Associated Press |date=6 February 2006 |location=Tehran |access-date=11 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/international/countriesandterritories/iran/nuclear_program/index.html |title=Iran's Nuclear Program |work=The New York Times |access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/2007/09/26/mahmoud-ahmadinejad-nuclear-issue-iran-is-now-closed/ |title=Mahmoud Ahmadinejad: 'Nuclear Issue of Iran Is Now Closed' |publisher=Fox News |agency=Associated Press |access-date=11 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following a May 2009 test launch of a long-range [[missile]], Ahmadinejad was quoted as telling the crowd that with its nuclear program, Iran was sending the West a message that "the Islamic Republic of Iran is running the show."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/05/21/world/middleeast/21iran.html?_r=1 |title=Iran Test-Fires Missile With 1,200-Mile Range |work=The New York Times |first1=David E.  |last=Sanger |first2=Nazila |last2=Fathimay  |date=20 May 2009 |access-date=11 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite Ahmadinejad's vocal support for the program, the office of the Iranian president is not directly responsible for nuclear policy. It is instead set by the [[Supreme National Security Council]]. The council includes two representatives appointed by the [[Supreme Leader]], military officials, and members of the executive, judicial, and legislative branches of government, and reports directly to Supreme Leader [[Ali Khamenei]], who issued a [[fatwa]] against nuclear weapons in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Recknagel |first=Charles |url=http://www.rferl.org/content/article/1059517.html |title=Iran: Election Of Ahmadinejad Unlikely To Affect Nuclear Negotiations |publisher=[[Radio Free Europe]] |date=27 June 2005 |access-date=11 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Khamenei has criticized Ahmadinejad's "personalization" of the nuclear issue.&lt;ref name=moderating&gt;{{cite news |url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/Iran-rebukes-its-prez-over-N-policy/articleshow/1319950.cms |title=Iran rebukes its prez over N-policy |work=[[The Times of India]] |date=19 January 2007 |access-date=26 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"No one in Iran will accept suspension," Mousavi has said, adding that if elected, his policy would be to work to provide "guarantees" that Tehran's nuclear activities would never divert to non-peaceful aims.&lt;ref name="PressTV-2009-04-14"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.presstv.ir/detail.aspx?id=91361&amp;sectionid=351020101 |title=Mousavi: Iran will never halt enrichment |date=14 April 2009 |publisher=PressTV |accessdate=1 July 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090417033036/http://www.presstv.ir/detail.aspx?id=91361&amp;sectionid=351020101 |archivedate=17 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2009, the [[United States]], [[France]], and [[Russia]] proposed a U.N.-drafted deal with Iran regarding its nuclear program, in an effort to find a compromise between Iran's stated need for a nuclear reactor and the concerns of those who are worried that Iran harbors a secret intent of developing a nuclear weapon. After some delay in responding, on 29 October, Ahmadinejad seemed to change his tone towards the deal. "We welcome fuel exchange, nuclear co-operation, building of power plants and reactors and we are ready to co-operate," he said in a live broadcast on state television.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aljazeera.com/news/middleeast/2009/10/2009102984633409448.html|title=Iran 'ready for nuclear agreement' – Middle East |publisher=Al Jazeera|date=29 October 2009|accessdate=7 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, he added that Iran would not retreat "one iota" on its right to a sovereign nuclear program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2009/10/29/us-iran-nuclear-idUSLT25626120091029|agency=Reuters |title=Iran proposes big changes to draft atom deal: report|date=29 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Domestic criticism and controversies==

===Accusations of corruption===
{{see also|2011 Iranian embezzlement scandal|Iran Insurance embezzlement case}}

According to Brussels-based NGO [[International Crisis Group]], Ahmadinejad has been criticized for attacking private "plunderers" and "corrupt officials," while engaging in "cronyism and political favouritism". Many of his close associates were appointed to positions for which they have no obvious qualifications, and "billion dollar no-bid contracts" were awarded to the [[Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps]] (IRGC), an organization with which he is strongly associated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.crisisgroup.org/home/index.cfm?id=4647&amp;l=1|title=Iran: Ahmadi-Nejad's Tumultuous Presidency |publisher=International Crisis Group|date=6 February 2007|accessdate=21 June 2009|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080709030746/http://www.crisisgroup.org/home/index.cfm?id=4647&amp;l=1|archivedate=9 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Najmeh Bozorgmehr of [[Financial Times]], "Iran has a long history of cronyism and corruption under its monarchies and the Islamic Republic. But the scale of corruption under Mr. Ahmadinejad was of a different order, according to both reform-minded and conservative politicians."&lt;ref name="Financial Times"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/8df9c092-ca2f-11e3-bb92-00144feabdc0.html|title=Iran: Rogue trader|work=Financial Times|date=5 June 2014 |accessdate=20 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2007, Ahmadinejad was criticized by some Iranian parliament members over his remark about [[Christianity]] and [[Judaism]]. According to Aftab News Agency, Ahmadinejad stated: "In the world, there are deviations from the right path: Christianity and Judaism. Dollars have been devoted to the propagation of these deviations. There are also false claims that these [religions] will save mankind. But Islam is the only religion that [can] save mankind." Some members of Iranian parliament criticized these remarks as being fuels to religious war.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbn.com/cbnnews/CWN/121605iran.aspx |title="Iran's President Threatens Crackdown on Christianity" |accessdate=2010-02-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080504173742/http://www.cbn.com/cbnnews/CWN/121605iran.aspx |archivedate=4 May 2008 |df= }} ''CBN News''.

Conservative MP Rafat Bayat has accused Ahmadinejad for a decline in observance of the required [[hijab]] for women, calling him "not that strict on this issue".&lt;ref&gt;Harrison, Frances.

===The UN and football stadiums===
There are two statements that led to criticism from some religious authorities. One concerns his speech at [[the United Nations]], and the other concerns the attendance of women at football matches. During a visit to group of Ayatollahs in [[Qom]] after returning from his 2005 speech to the [[UN General Assembly]], Ahmadinejad stated he had "felt a halo over his head" during his speech and that a hidden presence had mesmerized the unblinking audience of foreign leaders, foreign ministers, and ambassadors. Ahmedinejad closed his speech with a call for the "mighty Lord" to "hasten the emergence" of [[Imam Mahdi]].&lt;ref name=bgreg8&gt;{{cite news|last=Bruno|first=Greg|title=The Iranian political structure |url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/The+Iranian+political+structure.-a0182127664|accessdate=3 August 2013|newspaper=Iran Times International|date=11 July 2008|location=Washington DC}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Iranian-American journalist [[Hooman Majd]], the response given to Ahmedinejad at the assembly was offensive to the conservative religious leaders because an ordinary man cannot presume a special closeness to God or any of the [[Imamah (Shi'a doctrine)|Imams]], nor can he imply the presence of the Mahdi.&lt;ref name=majd2008p79&gt;{{cite book |authorlink=Hooman Majd |last=Majd |first=Hooman |title=The Ayatollah Begs to Differ: The Paradox of Modern Iran |publisher=Doubleday |year=2008 |isbn=0767928016 |page=79}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In another statement in 2006, Ahmadinejad proclaimed (without consulting the clerics beforehand), that women be allowed into football stadiums to watch male football clubs compete. This proclamation "was quickly overruled" by clerical authorities, one of whom, Grand Ayatollah [[Mohammad Fazel Lankarani]] "refused for weeks to meet with President Ahmadinejad" in early 2007.&lt;ref name=majd2008p79/&gt;

===Constitutional conflict===
In 2008, a serious conflict emerged between the Iranian President and the head of parliament over three laws approved by the Iranian parliament: "the agreement for civil and criminal legal cooperation between Iran and Kyrgyzstan", "the agreement to support mutual investment between Iran and Kuwait", and "the law for registration of industrial designs and trademarks". The conflict was so serious that the Iranian leader stepped in to resolve it. Ahmadinejad wrote a letter to the parliamentary speaker [[Gholam-Ali Haddad-Adel]], furiously denouncing him for the "inexplicable act" of bypassing the presidency by giving the order to implement legislation in an official newspaper.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newsmax.com/International/Ahmadinejad-under-fire/2008/04/23/id/323501|title=Iran President Ahmadinejad In Rows With 3 Leading Officials |date=23 April 2008 |location=Tehran|website=Newsmax.com |publisher=Agence France Presse |accessdate=21 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ahmadinejad accused the head of parliament of violating Iranian constitutional law. He called for legal action against the parliament speaker.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iran-press-service.com/ips/articles-2008/april-2008/ahmadinejad-attacks-haddad-adel.shtml|title=Ahmadinejad Attacks Haddad Adel |work=Iran-Press-Service.com |date=April 2008|accessdate=21 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.presstv.ir/detail.aspx?id=52720&amp;sectionid=351020101 |title=Haddad-Adel: Constitution not violated |agency=PressTV |date=23 April 2008 |accessdate=21 June 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081207114200/http://www.presstv.ir/detail.aspx?id=52720&amp;sectionid=351020101 |archivedate=7 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Haddad-Adel responded to Ahmadinejad accusing him of using inappropriate language in his remarks and letters.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.alef.ir/vdcg3z9x.ak9nt4prra.html?25046 الف – پاسخ رئیسمجلس به رئیسجمهور] ''Alef'' {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141018125358/http://www.alef.ir/vdcg3z9x.ak9nt4prra.html?25046 |date=18 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ali Kordan===
{{Main|Ali Kordan}}
In August 2008, Ahmadinejad appointed [[Ali Kordan]] as interior minister. Kordan's appointment was heavily criticized by Iranian parliamentarians, media and analysts after it came to light that a doctoral degree purportedly awarded to Kordan was fabricated, and that the putative issuer of the degree, [[Oxford University]], had no record of Kordan receiving any degree from the University.&lt;ref name="oxfordstatement"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ox.ac.uk/media/news_stories/2008/080815.html |title=Statement: Mr Ali Kordan |date=15 August 2008 |accessdate=17 August 2008 |publisher=The University of Oxford |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080817131229/http://www.ox.ac.uk/media/news_stories/2008/080815.html |archivedate=17 August 2008 |df=dmy}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was also revealed that he had been jailed in 1978 for moral charges.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.roozonline.com/archives/2008/08/post_8726.php|title=سوابق اخلاقي|date=14 August 2008|accessdate=14 August 2008|work=[[Rooz|Rooz online]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080822005850/http://www.roozonline.com/archives/2008/08/post_8726.php|archivedate=22 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2008, Ahmadinejad announced that he was against impeachment of Kordan by Iranian parliament. He refused to attend the parliament on the impeachment day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.africasia.com/services/news/newsitem.php?area=mideast&amp;item=081104102917.yxb25ese.php |title=News |work=Africasia |accessdate=21 June 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081207134205/http://www.africasia.com/services/news/newsitem.php?area=mideast&amp;item=081104102917.yxb25ese.php |archivedate=7 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kordan was expelled from office by Iranian parliament on 4 November 2008. 188 MPs voted against him. An impeachment of Kordan would push Ahmadinejad close to having to submit his entire cabinet for review by parliament, which was led by one of his chief political opponents. Iran's constitution requires that step if more than half the cabinet ministers are replaced, and Ahmadinejad replaced nine of 21 until that date.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/11/03/AR2008110301757.html?hpid=moreheadlines |title=Scandal, Fistfight Erupt Over Impeachment Move in Iran|newspaper=The Washington Post|date=4 November 2008|accessdate=21 June 2009|first=Thomas|last=Erdbrink}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/7707963.stm |title=Iran minister sacked over forgery|publisher=BBC News|date=4 November 2008|accessdate=21 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Conflict with Parliament===
[[File:Mahmoud Ahmadinejad in the Iranian Majlis (1).jpg|thumb|250px|Ahmadinejad speaking in the Majlis, Chairman [[Ali Larijani]] is also pictured]]
In February 2009, after [[Supreme Audit Court of Iran]] reported that $1.058 billion of surplus [[oil revenue]] in the (2006–2007) budget hadn't been returned by the government to the national treasury,&lt;ref name="international1"&gt;{{cite news  |url=http://www.upi.com/Energy_Resources/2009/02/16/Iran_examines_missing_oil_revenue/UPI-25891234800966/|title=Iran examines missing oil revenue|date=16 February 2009|work=United Press International|accessdate=23 February 2009
}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ali Larijani]], [[Majlis of Iran|Iran's parliamentary]] speaker, called for further investigations to make sure the missing funds are returned to the treasury as soon as possible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.presstv.ir/detail.aspx?id=84719&amp;sectionid=351020102 |title=Iran looks into missing $1B oil money |date=5 February 2009 |work=PressTV |accessdate=23 February 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090211131103/http://www.presstv.ir/detail.aspx?id=84719&amp;sectionid=351020102 |archivedate=11 February 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Tensions between Larijani and Ahmadinejad continued into 2013.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/05/world/middleeast/high-level-feud-bares-tensions-in-iran.html High level feud bares tensions in Iran] ''The New York Times'', 5 February 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

Ahmadinejad criticized the National Audit Office for what he called its "carelessness", saying the report "incites the people" against the government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.payvand.com/news/09/feb/1229.html#s364827|title=Oil Money Report Rejected|date=21 February 2009|work=Iran newspaper|accessdate=23 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The head of the parliament energy commission, Hamidreza Katouzian, reported "The government spent $5 billion to import fuel, about $2 billion more than the sum parliament had authorized." Katouzian quoted Iran's Oil Minister, Gholam-Hossein Nozari, as saying that President Ahmadinejad had ordered the extra purchase.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.presstv.com/detail.aspx?id=85792&amp;sectionid=351020102 |title=Majlis searching for $1B missing oil money |date=15 February 2009 |agency=PressTV |accessdate=23 February 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120308095614/http://www.presstv.com/detail.aspx?id=85792&amp;sectionid=351020102 |archivedate=8 March 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2011, several members of parliament threatened to initiate impeachment proceedings against Ahmadinejad after his merger of eight government ministries and the firing of three ministers without parliament's consent. According to the Majles news website, MP [[Mohammad Reza Bahonar]] stated, "legal purging starts with questions, which lead to warnings and end with impeachment." On 25 May, parliament voted to investigate another allegation, that Ahmadinejad had committed election irregularities by giving cash to up to nine million Iranians before the 2009 presidential elections. The vote came within hours after the allegations appeared in several popular conservative news sites associated with supreme leader [[Ali Khamenei]], suggesting the supreme leader supported the investigation.&lt;ref name=wayout&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.insideiran.org/domestic-relations/is-ahmadinejad-on-his-way-out/ |title=Is Ahmadinejad on His Way Out? |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110725083453/http://www.insideiran.org/domestic-relations/is-ahmadinejad-on-his-way-out/ |archivedate=25 July 2011 |website=InsideIran.org |date=25 May 2011 |first=Shayan |last=Ghajar |access-date=11 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The disputes were seen as part of the clash between Ahmadinejad and other conservatives and former supporters, including supreme leader Khamenei, over what the conservatives see as Ahmadinejad's confrontational policies and abuse of power.&lt;ref name="wayout"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/ayatollah-irans-president-bewitched-by-senior-aide/2011/05/15/AF7vOG4G_story.html |title=Ayatollah: Iran's president 'bewitched' by senior aide |first=Thomas |last=Erdbrink |work=The Washington Post |date=15 May 2011 |access-date=11 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hugo Chavez's funeral===
Ahmedinejad was criticised by the religious and political groups in Iran for photographs taken of him embracing Elena Frias de Chavez, the mother of recently deceased Venezuelan president [[Hugo Chavez]], at his funeral. In the image, Ahmedinejad was thought to be holding her hands and in a cheek-to-cheek embrace; such an act, touching an unrelated woman, is considered [[haraam]] (forbidden) in Islam.&lt;ref name="National Post, 'Lost control:' Iran's Ahmadinejad under fire..."&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.nationalpost.com/news/irans-ahmadinejad-under-fire-from-conservative-critics-for-picture-of-him-consoling-hugo-chavezs-mother|work=National Post|title='Lost control:' Iran's Ahmadinejad under fire from conservative critics for picture of him consoling Hugo Chavez's mother|author=National Post Staff and The Associated Press |date=11 March 2013|accessdate=11 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NBC mother"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://worldnews.nbcnews.com/_news/2013/03/11/17272211-ahmadinejads-scandalous-moment-with-hugo-chavezs-mother?lite |title=NBC News, Ahmadinejad's scandalous moment with Hugo Chavez's mother |date=11 March 2013 |accessdate=17 March 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130314004548/http://worldnews.nbcnews.com/_news/2013/03/11/17272211-ahmadinejads-scandalous-moment-with-hugo-chavezs-mother?lite |archivedate=14 March 2013 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Iranian government officials responded by stating that the image was a fake, then released a second photo showing Ahmadinejad in the same pose, but in this case hugging a man.&lt;ref name=hug&gt;{{cite news|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2013/03/13/opinion/gmez-chavez-ahmadinejad-america/index.html|publisher=CNN|title=Ahmadinejad's hug and the future of Chavez's alliance|date=13 March 2013|accessdate=17 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; This later photograph was debunked when it was discovered that the other man was Egyptian opposition leader [[Mohamed ElBaradei]], who had not been at the funeral.&lt;ref name=hug /&gt;

===Nepotism===
One of the most frequent criticisms about Ahmedinejad has been [[nepotism]] in his governments.

==Foreign relations==
{{Main|Foreign policy of Mahmoud Ahmadinejad}}
[[File:IRAN PresidentMahmoud AhmadinejadPresidential Trips.png|thumb|Countries visited by President Ahmadinejad during his terms in office]]
During Ahmadinejad's tenure as President of Iran the foreign policy of the country took a different approach from the previous administration. Relations with [[developed country|developed countries]] generally soured while relations with [[Developing country|less-developed countries]], including Africa and Latin America, rose. In light of the calls for sanctions on Iran for its nuclear weapons programme, Ahmadinejad and his foreign minister, Manouchehr Mottaki, traveled extensively throughout the two regions, as well as hosted other leaders. Relations with the [[Bolivarian Alliance for the Americas|ALBA]] states, and [[Venezuela]], [[Bolivia]], and [[Ecuador]], in particular, were most strengthened. Relations with America during the [[Presidency of George W. Bush|Bush administration]] and Israel deteriorated further.

Ahmadinejad is an outspoken critic of the [[Western world]] and is often criticized for his hostility towards the [[United States]], [[Israel]], the [[United Kingdom]] and other Western nations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.jpost.com/International/Ahmadinejad-blames-West-for-AIDS|title=Ahmadinejad blames West for AIDS|publisher=Associated Press |work=[[The Jerusalem Post]]|date=29 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="President Ahmadinejad, Part 2"&gt;{{YouTube|QW1DltEt5z4|President Ahmadinejad, Part 2}}, [[CBS]]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Israel===

Ahmadinejad abides by Iran's long-standing policy of refusing to recognize [[Israel]] as a legitimate state, and wants the Jewish people who immigrated to Israel to return to their "fatherlands" (''translated'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2006/WORLD/meast/04/24/iran.nuclear/index.html?_s=PM:WORLD |title=Iran president says UN sanctions unlikely |publisher=CNN|date=24 April 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, Ahmadinejad, in  a speech praising the Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khomeini, was translated by Iranian state-run media as saying that "Israel must be wiped off the map."&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070927213903/http://www.iribnews.ir/Full_en.asp?news_id=200247 "Ahmadinejad: Israel must be wiped off the map"], IRIB News, 26 October 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Nazeela|first=Fathi|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/10/27/world/middleeast/irans-new-president-says-israel-must-be-wiped-off-the-map.html |title=Iran's New President Says Israel 'Must Be Wiped Off the Map'|work=The New York Times|date=27 October 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/4378948.stm |title=Iran leader's comments attacked |publisher=BBC |date=2005-10-27 |accessdate=2015-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; A controversy erupted over the translation, with specialists such as [[Juan Cole]] of the University of Michigan and  Arash Norouzi of the Mossadegh Project pointing out that the original statement in [[Persian language|Farsi]] did not say that Israel should be wiped off the map, but instead that it would collapse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Kessler |first1=Glenn |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/fact-checker/post/did-ahmadinejad-really-say-israel-should-be-wiped-off-the-map/2011/10/04/gIQABJIKML_blog.html |title=Did Ahmadinejad really say Israel should be 'wiped off the map'? |work=Washington Post |date=5 October 2011 |accessdate=2015-07-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Friedman |first=Uri |url=http://www.thewire.com/global/2011/10/debating-every-last-word-ahmadinejads-wipe-israel-map/43372/ |title=Debating Every Last Word of Ahmadinejad's 'Wipe Israel Off the Map' |work=The Wire |date=2011-10-05 |accessdate=2015-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Steele|first=Jonathan|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2006/jun/14/post155|title=Lost in translation|work=The Guardian|date=14 June 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The words  'Israel', 'map', and 'to wipe off'  are non-existent in the Iranian speech's original.

In [[Katajun Amirpur]]'s analysis, there is no implication in the text that Iran intended destroying Israel or annihilating the Jewish people, any more than Khomeini was suggesting with his words that the Russians, or the Iranian people themselves under the Shah would be extinguished.&lt;ref name="Amirpur" /&gt; Ahmadinejad is on the record as stating that Iran had no plans to attack Israel.&lt;ref name="Amirpur" /&gt; The statement itself was in fact a citation, with a minute verbal variation, of a remark made by Ayatollah Khomeini in 1979, which had created no furor at the time, but did so when Ahmadinejad quoted them in 2005.&lt;ref name =Hooglund&gt;{{cite book|first=Eric |last=Hooglund|chapter=Decoding Ahmadinejad's rhetoric on Israel|editor-first1=Eric |editor-last1=Hooglund|editor-first2=Leif |editor-last2=Stenberg|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YNzFBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT206  |title=Navigating Contemporary Iran: Challenging Economic, Social and Political Perceptions|publisher=Routledge |year=2013|pages=198–206}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Dan Meridor]], Israel's minister of intelligence and atomic energy said during an [[Al Jazeera]] interview that Ayatollah Ali Khamenei had repeatedly said "that Israel is an unnatural creature, it will not survive. They didn't say, 'We'll wipe it out,' you're right, but, 'It will not survive.'" adding "If Iran says this, and continues to pile up uranium that they enrich, and build missiles in big numbers, and have a nuclear military plan—if you put all this together, you can't say, they don't really mean it."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.israelhayom.com/site/newsletter_article.php?id=3984|title=Meridor: Ahmadinejad didn't say, 'Wipe Israel off the map'|date=17 April 2012|website=Israel Hayom|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Washington Post's fact-checker editor Glenn Kessler says the interpretation gets murkier when Ahmadinejad's quote is set against other Iranian propaganda. Karim Sadjadpour, an Iranian specialist at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, cites proof that the Iranian government releases propaganda that clearly says Israel should be "wiped off."

==After presidency==
[[File:Mahmoud Ahmadinejad in his office as former President of Islamic Republic of Iran 01.jpg|thumb|Ahmadinejad in his [[Museum|presidential museum]], known as Office of the Former President of Islamic Republic of Iran]]
Ahmedinejad left his office at  Pasteur st. on 3 August 2013 and returned to his private house in [[Narmak]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tabnak.ir/fa/news/336282/%D8%B1%D9%88%D8%AD%D8%A7%D9%86%DB%8C-%D8%AF%D8%B1-%D9%BE%D8%A7%D8%B3%D8%AA%D9%88%D8%B1-%D9%85%D8%B3%D8%AA%D9%82%D8%B1-%D8%B4%D8%AF News] ''Tabnak''&lt;/ref&gt;

In an interview with [[CNN]], Ahmadinejad said that, after the end of his presidency, he would return to the university and retire from politics. However, Ahmadinejad announced from Russia on the sidelines of an [[OPEC]] summit on 2 July 2013 that he might stay involved with politics by creating a new party or [[non-governmental organization]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://khabaronline.ir/detail/301621/Politics/election احمدی نژاد: در سیاست باقی می‌مانم/ دو سال قبل به اردوغان گفتم می‌توان مسئله سوریه را حل کرد&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; In late July, ''Mehr news agency'' reported that Ahmadinejad obtained permission from the [[Supreme Cultural Revolution Council]] to launch a university for post-graduate studies in Tehran.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Nasseri|first=Ladane|title=Iran's Ahmadinejad to Set Up University After Exit From Office|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-07-28/iran-s-ahmadinejad-to-set-up-university-after-exit-from-office.html|accessdate=29 July 2013|agency=Bloomberg|date=29 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 5 August 2013, the Supreme Leader [[Ali Khamenei]] issued a decree appointing Ahmedinejad as a member of the [[Expediency Council]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Ahmadinejad in new appointment|url=http://www.albawaba.com/news/ahmadinejad-new-appointment-512025|accessdate=5 August 2013|newspaper=Albawaba|date=5 August 2013|agency=FNA|location=Tehran}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 15 June 2015, a number of Ahmadinejad's cabinet ministers established a new political party, called [[YEKTA Front]]. The party published list for [[Iranian legislative election, 2016|2016 legislative election]] and some of Ahmadinejad's cabinet members (like [[Hamid-Reza Haji Babaee]], [[Sadeq Khalilian]], [[Mohammad Abbasi]] and [[Mahmoud Bahmani]]) registered for the election, but Ahmadinejad did not support any list in the election.

In December 2015, it was reported that he had begun his presidential campaign by appointing his campaign's chiefs. He also began provincial travels in April 2016 by traveling to [[Amol]].

Since 2005, Ahmadinejad has introduced himself as non-partisan, even anti-party and did not try to gain support of political parties despite being supported by the [[Iranian Principlists|conservative camp]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first1=Azam|last1=Moghadas|first2=Masuod|last2=Ghaffari|url=http://www.ajssh.leena-luna.co.jp/AJSSHPDFs/Vol.5(4)/AJSSH2016(5.4-04).pdf|title=Civil Society and Democratization in Iran (1979-2009)|journal=Asian Journal of Social Sciences &amp; Humanities|volume=5|number=4|pages=37–44|year=November 2016|issn=2186-8492|location=Chikusei, Japan}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[National Democratic Institute]] report published in 2009 states that Ahmadinejad is self-described "[[Iranian Principlists|Principlist]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite|url=https://www.ndi.org/es/node/5495|title=Presidential Candidates|work=National Democratic Institute|date=21 May 2009|access-date=8 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ahmadinejad is widely known for his [[vulgarism]], undiplomatic language and usage of [[slang]] terms.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=https://www.rferl.org/a/The_Language_Of_Ahmadinejad_The_Boogeyman_Snatched_The_Boob/2125263.html|title=The Language Of Ahmadinejad: 'The Bogeyman Snatched The Boob'|author=Golnaz Esfandiari|date=11 August 2010|access-date=1 August 2017|publisher=Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is active on [[Twitter]], where he engages his followers primarily in English and tweets about sports, the United States, and current events using pop cultural references that have been described as funny and "woke".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.dailydot.com/layer8/ahmadinejad-twitter/|title=Iran's Mahmoud Ahmadinejad can't stop responding to tweets today|date=2018-10-16|work=The Daily Dot|access-date=2018-10-16|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.jpost.com/Middle-East/The-curious-case-of-woke-Ahmadinejad-569537|title=The curious case of ‘woke’ Ahmadinejad|work=The Jerusalem Post {{!}} JPost.com|access-date=2018-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a poll conducted by ''Information and Public Opinion Solutions LLC'' (iPOS) in March 2016, Ahmadinejad is the least popular political figure in Iran, while he has 57% approval and 39% disapproval ratings, thus a +18% net popularity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ipos.me/polls/2016/05/24/zarif/|title= ظریف محبوب‌ترین چهره سیاسی ایران |work=Information and Public Opinion Solutions LLC|date=24 May 2016|access-date=24 May 2016|language=Persian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Manovo-Gounda St. Floris National Park''' is a national park and [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]] located in the [[Central African Republic]] prefecture [[Bamingui-Bangoran]], near the [[Chad]] border. It was inscribed to the list of World Heritage Sites in 1988 as a result of the diversity of life present within it. Notable species include [[black rhinoceros]]es, [[African elephant|elephant]]s, [[Sudan cheetah]]s, [[African leopard|leopard]]s, [[red-fronted gazelle]]s, and [[African buffalo|buffalo]], [[Kordofan giraffe|giraffe]]s, [[West African lion|lion]]s; a wide range of waterfowl species also occurs in the northern floodplains. The site is under threat due to its rare wildlife dying and animals species being wiped out. The [[western black rhinoceros]] that was indigenous to the Central African Republic has gone extinct in 2011. The site was added to the [[List of World Heritage in Danger]] after reports of illegal grazing and poaching by heavily armed hunters, who may have harvested as much as 80% of the park's wildlife. The shooting of four members of the park staff in early 1997 and a general state of deteriorating security brought all development projects and tourism to a halt. The government of the Central African Republic proposed to assign site management responsibility to a private foundation. The preparation of a detailed state of conservation report and rehabilitation plan for the site was recommended by the World Heritage Committee at its 1998 session. People are working on breeding programs to revive the natural wildlife.

== Location ==
The park occupies most of the eastern end of [[Bamingui-Bangoran]] province in the north of the country. The park's northern boundary is the international border with [[Chad]] on the Aouk (Bahr) and Kameur Rivers. The eastern border is the Vakaga River, the western border is the Manovo River about 40&amp;nbsp;km east of [[N'Délé]], and the southern border is the ridge of the [[Massif des Bongo]]. The [[Ndéle-Birao road]] runs through the park.

'''Mokilese''' also known as '''Mwoakilloan''', '''Mwokilese''', or '''Mwoakilese''' is a [[Micronesian languages|Micronesian language]] originally spoken on [[Mokil Atoll|Mwoakilloa]], [[Federated States of Micronesia]]. Of the 1200 Mokilese speakers, only about 500 live on [[Mokil Atoll|Mwoakilloa]].&lt;ref&gt;Lewis, M. Paul (ed.), 2009. Ethnologue: Languages of the World, Sixteenth edition. Dallas, Tex.: SIL International. Online version: http://www.ethnologue.com/.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Introduction==
===History===
Mokilese originated from the [[Mokil Atoll|Mokil]] (or Mwoakilloa) Atoll, but speakers have also migrated approximately 100 miles west, to the [[Pohnpei]] Islands, and parts of the [[United States]]. [[Mwoakilloa]] and [[Pohnpei]] are both geographically part of the [[Caroline Islands]] just above [[Papua New Guinea]]. Mwoakilloa is a district of the outlying islands of [[Pohnpei]] of the [[Federated States of Micronesia]]. 

Before [[Western world|Western]] contact, Mokilese only had contact with its neighboring islands: [[Pohnpei]], [[Pingelap]], [[Kosrae]], and the [[Marshall Islands]]. After [[Spanish people|Spanish]] explorers "rediscovered" Mokil Atoll, they colonized it in 1886  (Hezel, 1992). Shortly after they lost the [[Spanish-American]] War in 1898, they sold it to [[Germany]] (Encyclopædia Britannica, 2014). Later, in 1914, it was seized by [[Japan]] and heavily fortified during [[World War II]], until [[Japan]] surrendered and passed it on to the [[United States]] in August 1945 (Hezel, 1992). Thereafter, it became a part of the [[UN trust territory]] under U.S. jurisdiction in 1947 until the trust territory dissolved in 1986 (Encyclopædia Britannica, 2014).

===Population===
Mokilese is both the name of the Mokil population and the language which they speak. It is currently spoken on [[Mokil Atoll|Mokil]] Atoll, the [[Pohnpei]] Islands, and in some parts of the [[United States]]. There are only approximately 1,500 speakers of this language left. 1,050 of whom reside in [[Micronesia]]; a little over 900 in [[Pohnpei]] and less than 150 in [[Mokil]] Atoll. The other 450 speakers are scattered across the [[United States]] (Lewis, Simons, &amp; Fennig, 2013). Although this language originated in Mokil Atoll, there are now only around 150 speakers who live in Mokil Atoll, while the rest live in diaspora communities ―approximately 100 miles west― to Pohnpei, where they remain until this day (Rehg &amp; Bender, 1990).

===Classification===
Mokilese is a Micronesian language, and therefore, a part of the [[Austronesian language family]]. Mokilese belongs to the [[Ponapeic subgrouping]], and is the sister language of [[Pingelapese language|Pingelapese]] and [[Pohnpeian language|Pohnpeian]]. Mokilese shares approximately 79%  [[lexical similarity]] with [[Pingelapese language|Pingelapese]], and 75% with [[Pohnpeian language|Pohnapeian]] (Lewis, Simons, &amp; Fennig, 2013).

==Sounds==
===Consonants===
The Mokilese language consists of the following consonant [[phonemes]]: /p, b, f, v, m, θ, ð, t, d, s, z, n, l, r, c, j, ŋ̃, y, k, g, ŋ, pʷ, mʷ, and w/ (Harrison &amp; Albert, 1976). Note, that these are not the number of consonants that they use in writing, but rather the number of different consonant sounds they produce. There are also quite a few consonant [[allophones]] in the Mokilese language: /p, pʷ, m, mʷ, t, θ, d, ð, n, ŋ̃, ŋ/.

===Vowels===
The vowel phonemes present in Mokilese are: /i, e, ɛ, ɨ, ʉ, ə, ʌ, a, u, o, and ɔ/ (Harrison &amp; Albert, 1976). Mokilese use both long and short vowels for all existing vowels. Mokilese also allows [[triphthongs]] in their language, which is rare among the Pacific languages.

*''jaua'' – sweet taro
*''doau'' – climb

===Syllable structure===
Mokilese uses words which begin and end with a consonant, begin and end with a vowel, begin with a vowel and end with a consonant, and even ones that begin with a consonant and end with a vowel. However, this does not mean that there are no rule at all. Mokilese syllable still maintain a set of rules as explained by Harrison and Albert (1976):

# In Mokilese, a sequence of consonants within a word does not normally belong to the same syllable, because it is difficult to produce a sequence like CCV. If two consonants come together within a word, place a [[syllable boundary]] between them. (Remember that ng is a single consonant even though it is written with two letters.)
#: ''angkoa'' ‘anchor’ ''ang-koa''
#: ''dipkelkel'' ‘to stumble’ ‘‘dip-kel-kel’’
#: ''janjal'' ‘clear’ ‘‘jan-jal’’

# If a single consonant occurs between two vowels within a word, place a syllable boundary before the consonant.
#: ‘‘dangahnga’’ ‘lazy’ ‘‘da-ngah-nga’’
#: ‘‘widek’’ ‘to pour’ ‘‘wi-dek’’
#: ‘‘pere’’ ‘room’ ‘‘pe-re’’

# If two vowels come together within a word, place a syllable boundary between them.
#: ‘‘duhrion’’ ‘kind of tree’ ‘‘duh-ri-on’’
#: ‘‘injinjued’’ ‘sad’ ‘‘in-jin-ju-ed’’
#: ‘‘kia’’ ‘to not want’ ‘‘ki-a’’

==Grammar==
===Basic word order===
The basic [[word order]] for Mokilese is Subject-Verb-Object (Harrison &amp; Albert, 1976).

‘‘ex. Woal lapp-o loakjid phon woss-o. ’’
Man old-that to fish on reef-that
That old man is fishing on the reef.

This example shows the subject (man) comes first, then the verb (to fish), and lastly, the object (reef).

===Reduplication===
There are many forms of [[reduplication]] in Mokilese. The most common reduplication form is a reduplication of the first CVC of a word.

*‘‘poadok’’ –to plant something
**‘‘poadpoadok’’ – to be planting something
*‘‘loang’’ – fly
**‘‘loangloang’’ – full of flies

Next, there’s the CVh reduplication form. This is the reduplication of the first CV of a word and lengthening of the vowel with /h/.

*‘‘wia’’ – to do
**‘‘wihwi’a’’ – to be doing 
*‘‘no’’ – a wave
**‘‘nohno’’ – lots of waves

Another reduplication form Mokilese has is VCC. When reduplicating VC, the consonant is also [[geminated]].

*‘‘oapi’’ – to pull something
**‘‘oappoap’’ – to pull
*‘‘ir’’ – to string
**‘‘irrir’’ – to be stringing

There is also the CV reduplication, which reduplicates the first CV of a word. However, sometimes the CV reduplication can become CVV.

*mwahl’’ – bad
**mwamwahl’’ – to treat badly
*‘‘doa’’ – to sew something
**‘‘doadoa’’ – to sew
	
Lastly, there is also the CVC reduplication form. CVC reduplicates the last CVC of a word rather than the first, and it is also a suffix, unlike the other forms, which are prefixes.

*‘‘pwirej’’ – dirt
**‘‘pwirejrej’’ – dirty
*‘‘sakai’’ – rock
**‘‘sakaikai’’ – rocky

===Numerals===
Mokilese has a base 10 counting system. Rather than having just one set of numbers, Mokilese has four sets, each used to count different things. Each number consist of a [[numeral prefix]] and a [[numeral classifier]]. Most of the numeral prefixes are similar across the four different sets, it is the general classifier that distinguishes one set from another. The four general classifiers are ‘‘–w, ‘‘–men, ‘‘–pas, and ‘‘–kij, as shown in the chart below.

{| class="wikitable" |

|e-men
|e-pas

|walu-w
|wal-men
|wal-pas
|wal-lij
|-
|''Nine''
|duoa-w
|doh-man
|doh-pas
|doh-kij
|}

‘‘–w’’ is a general classifier; it is used to count numbers and describe other objects that are not covered by the other number classifiers.

*‘‘puk riaw’’ – two books

‘‘-men’’ describes animate nouns such as people, bird, animal, fish, etc.

*‘‘woal roahmen’’ – two men

‘‘-pas’’ is used to describe long objects like pencil, canoe, songs, stories, road, etc.
*‘‘suhkoa rahpas’’ – two trees

‘‘-kij’’ is for describing things that have parts and pieces such as slices of bread, sheets of paper, fragment of a mirror, etc.

*‘‘wija ijkij’’ – seven pieces of land

Mokilese’s numerals can also reach up to the billions. However, most of the higher numerals are rarely used because there are only so many things that they would need to count in millions or billions.

==Vocabulary==
===Indigenous vocabulary===
*‘‘soa’’ - leaf
*‘‘ros’’ - dark
*‘‘ringoaingoai’’ - thin
*‘‘pik’’ - sand
*‘‘war’’ - canoe
*‘‘doahk’’ - dog
*‘‘ad" - name

===Loanwords===
Mokilese has borrowed numerous words from languages of foreigners who traveled into [[Micronesia]], as well as from other Micronesian languages. Some Micronesian languages that influenced Mokilese were [[Pohnpeian language|Pohnpeian]], [[Marshallese language|Marshallese]], [[Pingelapese language|Pingelapese]], and [[Kosraean language|Kusaiean]] (Rehg &amp; Bender, 1990). The reason why Mokilese borrowed words from these languages was because they had lived in close contact with the people of these islands for many years. Because of how this borrowing occurred, it is hard to tell exactly when the words were borrowed, especially since there were hardly any documentations from back then. On top of that, not all [[loanwords]] are easy to identify because these languages are all, more or less, closely related to Mokilese. Sheldon P. Harrison (1976) believed there to be more loanwords from other Micronesian languages, but “it is difficult to tell exactly how many because of the problems in distinguishing such borrowings from native Mokilese words.” With that said, a few loanwords from these places have been identified.

Words derived from [[Pohnpeian language|Pohnpeian]]:

*‘‘indan’’ – popular
*‘‘pohnkahke’’ – lazy
*‘‘rahnmwahu’’ – greetings
*‘‘wahnpoaroan’’ – minister

Words derived from Marshallese:

*‘‘moado’’ – skilled navigator
*‘‘mej’’ – exhausted

Word derived from Marshallese:

*‘‘doa’’ – sugar cane

Mokilese also borrowed words from foreign languages such as [[German language|German]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[Japanese language|Japanese]], and [[English language|English]]. These borrowings occurred due to colonization. The first of these languages to come in contact with Mokilese was [[Spanish language|Spanish]], which occurred in the 16th century, when Spanish explorers discovered [[Micronesia]] (Hezel, 1992). Then they colonized the [[Mokil Atoll|Mokil]] Atoll in 1886. Shortly after, Spain sold the island to [[Germany]] after they lost the [[Spanish–American War]] in 1898  (Encyclopædia Britannica, 2014). Later, in 1914, the island was seized by [[Japan]] in 1919, and heavily fortified during [[World War II]], until they surrendered and passed it on to [[United States]] in August of 1945 (Hezel, 1992). Thereafter, it became part of a UN trust territory under U.S. jurisdiction in 1947 until the trust territory dissolved in 1986 (Encyclopædia Britannica, 2014). All this outside contact introduced many loanwords to Mokilese, although there are only a few for [[Spanish language|Spanish]] and [[German language|German]] because their contact durations were shorter.

Word derived from [[Spanish language|Spanish]]:

*‘‘pwohla’’ – ball
*‘‘mihsa’’ – mass

Word derived from [[German language|German]]:

*‘‘dois’’ – Germany
*‘‘mahk’’ – mark/German money

Word derived from [[Japanese language|Japanese]]:

*‘‘sasimi’’ – raw fish, from ‘‘sashimi
*‘‘middo’’ – catcher’s mitt, from ‘‘mitto
*‘‘aramaki’’ – belly band, from ‘‘haramaki
*‘‘ansu’’ – apricot tree, from ‘‘anzu no ki
*‘‘ohdai’’ – bandage, from ‘‘hotai
*‘‘jidohsa’’ – car, from ‘‘jidosha
*‘‘jikeng’’ – test, from ‘‘shiken
*‘‘pehnggohsi’’ – defender, from ‘‘bengosha

Word derived from [[English language|English]] (before WWII):
	
*‘‘sehpil’’ – table
*‘‘jip’’ – ship
*‘‘kepden’’ – captain
*‘‘ama’’ – hammer
*‘‘pilahwa’’ – flour, bread
*‘‘roam’’ – rum
*‘‘ju’’ – shoe
*‘‘ehl’’ – Hell
*‘‘krihn’’ – green
*‘‘inj’’ – inch
*‘‘dainj’’ – dance

Word derived from English (after WWII):

*‘‘delpwohn’’ – telephone
*‘‘kias’’ – gasoline
*‘‘klohraks’’ – bleach
*‘‘kirajiweid’’ – graduate
*‘‘koangkiris’’ – congress

==Endangerment==
===Materials===
	Not only is the Mokilese language [[endangered]], it also lacks extensive documentation. The complete published resources are a Mokilese-English Dictionary (Harrison &amp; Albert, 1977) and a Mokilese Reference Grammar (Harrison &amp; Albert, 1976). However these resources are fairly outdated since they were written in the 1960s and the language is changing rapidly. Other physical materials in Mokilese are books of chants, songs, accounts and tales of Mokil Atoll, which are few. There is also one short interview video, and a couple of war dance videos on YouTube. However, there are no websites, TV shows, or radio stations in their language.

===Vitality===
	Mokilese is an endangered language. It is only spoken at home, and the [[intergenerational transmission]] is getting worse with each generation. This is because the younger generations are not fluent speakers, they prefer learning [[Pohnpeian language|Pohnpeian]] and [[English language|English]] instead, so only the elders and adults are actually fluent (Poll, 2013). This is just for the Mokilese speakers in [[Pohnpei]] and [[Mokil Atoll|Mokil]] Atoll; the speakers in the U. S. are all old and have no domains of use, so when they die, there will be no more speakers in the United States (Lewis, Simons, &amp; Fennig, 2013). On top of that, Mokilese not only does not have government recognition, there is not even a single school that teaches Mokilese (Poll, 2013).

'''Mr. Creosote''' is a fictional character who appears in [[Monty Python|Monty Python's]] ''[[Monty Python's The Meaning of Life|The Meaning of Life]]''. He is a monstrously [[Obesity|obese]] restaurant patron who is served a vast amount of food whilst vomiting repeatedly. After being persuaded to eat an after-dinner mint, he explodes in a very graphic way. The sketch opens the film's segment titled "Part VI: The Autumn Years".

The character is played by [[Terry Jones]], who directed the film.&lt;ref name=lunch&gt;{{citation |first=John | last=Hind|url=https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2012/may/20/terry-jones-interview-mr-creosote |title=Lunch with Terry Jones| work=[[The Guardian]] |publisher=Guardian media Group|location=London, England|date=20 May 2012|accessdate=5 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Synopsis==
In the sketch, Mr. Creosote dines at a [[French cuisine|French]] restaurant. The entrance of this morbidly obese middle-aged man is accompanied by ominous music.  One of the fish in the aquarium exclaims "Oh shit—it's Mr. Creosote!" as he passes, causing all the fish to swim for cover.  The scene opens with a short dialogue between Mr. Creosote and the [[Maître d'hôtel|maître d']], played by [[John Cleese]]:

*'''Maître d':''' "Ah, good afternoon, sir; and how are we today?"
*'''Mr. Creosote:''' "Better."
*'''Maître d':''' "Better?"
*'''Mr. Creosote:''' "Better get a bucket, I'm gonna throw up."

Creosote is then led to his table, and once seated starts projectile-vomiting, failing to hit the bucket he had requested a moment before. The floor quickly becomes covered in {{em|vomitus}}, and so do the cleaning woman and the maître d's trousers. Creosote listens patiently while highlights of the evening's menu are recited to him; after vomiting on the menu held open in front of him by the maître d', he orders all of the dishes listed by the maitre d'. As a result, he is served [[Mussel|moules marinières]], [[Foie gras|pâté de foie gras]], beluga [[caviar]], [[Eggs Benedict]], a leek [[tart]], [[frog legs|frogs' legs]] [[amandine (culinary term)|amandine]] and [[Quail eggs|quail's eggs]] with puréed mushrooms all mixed in a bucket with the quail eggs on top and a double helping of pâté. The appetizers are followed by the main course of [[jugging|jugged]] [[hare]], with a sauce of truffles, bacon, Grand Marnier, anchovies and cream. For drinks, Mr. Creosote has six bottles of [[Château Latour]] 1945, a [[Wine bottle#Sizes|Methuselah]] (Double Jeroboam/6 litres) of champagne, and half a dozen crates of [[brown ale]] (144 bottles)—considerably less than his usual fare.

*'''Maitre D''': Bon, and the usual brown ales&amp;nbsp;...?
*'''Mr. Creosote''': Yeah… No wait a minute&amp;nbsp;... I think I can only manage six crates today.

He finishes the feast, and several other courses, vomiting profusely all over himself, his table, and the restaurant's staff throughout his meal, causing other diners to lose their appetite, and in some cases, throw up as well. Finally, after being persuaded by the smooth maître d' to eat a single "wafer-thin mint", his stomach begins to rapidly expand until it explodes: covering the restaurant and diners with viscera and partially digested food—even starting a "vomit-wave" among the other diners, who leave in disgust.

When the explosion clears, Creosote is amazingly still alive, but his chest cavity and abdomen are now blasted open, revealing his spread ribs and intact, still-beating heart, and viscera. As he looks around, seemingly confused by what has just happened, the maître d' calmly walks up to him and presents, "the cheque, monsieur."

==Production==
In the documentary ''The Meaning of Making 'The Meaning of Life''' (2003), John Cleese said that the sketch, originally written by Jones and [[Michael Palin]], was initially rejected. Cleese said the sketch suffered from a flawed construction and rewrote it with [[Graham Chapman]]. At the ''U.S. Comedy Arts Festival&amp;nbsp;— Tribute to Monty Python'' it was claimed Cleese was taken with the unflappable maître d' character. Jones thought Creosote should be played by fellow Python [[Terry Gilliam]], before Gilliam persuaded Jones to play the role instead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.yorkshirepost.co.uk/news/features/the_yorkshire_post_video_interview_python_terry_jones_1_2341143|title=The Yorkshire Post video interview: Python Terry Jones|work=[[The Yorkshire Post]]|publisher=Johnston Press|location=Leeds, England|date=3 April 2009|accessdate=13 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jones was transformed into Mr. Creosote by British prosthetic make-up artist [[Christopher Tucker]], who also created the prosthetic effects for the American film drama [[The Elephant Man (film)|''The Elephant Man'']] (1980).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Jonathan|last=Sanger|title=Making The Elephant Man: A Producer’s Memoir|date=2016|publisher=McFarland &amp; Co.|location=Jefferson, North Carolina|isbn=978-1476666624|page=72|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=zQBODQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA72&amp;lpg=PA72&amp;dq=%22christopher+tucker%22+%22elephant+man%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=5_aVJVyyTK&amp;sig=I-bG3MSK08QKLA40Xnxm6q5SDIg&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjA5pK29fnWAhUV_mMKHQcxCBMQ6AEIdTAO#v=onepage&amp;q=%22christopher%20tucker%22%20%22elephant%20man%22&amp;f=false|accessdate=18 October 2017|ref=Sanger}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The {{em|vomitus}} was portrayed using large amounts of condensed [[Minestrone|minestrone soup]].

==Reception==
When asked about his proclivity toward gruesome film violence, director [[Quentin Tarantino]] said that the "Mr. Creosote" scene was the only time he had been disturbed by a graphic or gruesome film sequence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Quentin Tarantino on Kill Bill Vol. 2|url=http://www.film4.com/special-features/interviews/quentin-tarantino-on-kill-bill-vol2|author= | publisher=[[Channel 4]] | accessdate=23 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his ''2015 Movie Guide'', [[Leonard Maltin]] described Mr. Creosote as having "an unforgettable scene, like it or not".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Leonard|last=Maltin |year=2014 |title=Leonard Maltin's 2015 Movie Guide |publisher=[[Penguin Books]]|location=London, England|isbn=0698183614}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Native Hawaiians''' ([[Hawaiian language|Hawaiian]]:&amp;nbsp;''kānaka ʻōiwi'', ''kānaka maoli'', and ''Hawaiʻi maoli'') are the [[Indigenous peoples|aboriginal]] [[Polynesians|Polynesian]] people of the [[Hawaiian Islands]] or their descendants.&lt;ref name="dictionary"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.ahdictionary.com/word/search.html?q=native+hawaiian |title=American Heritage Dictionary Entry: native hawaiian |work=[[The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language]] |edition=Fifth |accessdate= March 23, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Native Hawaiians trace their ancestry back to the original Polynesian settlers of Hawaii. In total, 527,000 Americans consider themselves Native Hawaiian.&lt;ref name=Hixson /&gt;

According to the [[2010 U.S. Census]], there are 371,000 people who identified themselves as being "Native Hawaiian" alone or in combination with one or more other races or Pacific Islander groups. 156,000 people identified themselves as being "Native Hawaiian" alone.

The majority of Native Hawaiians reside in the state of [[Hawaii]] (two-thirds), and the rest are scattered among other states, especially in the American Southwest, and with a high concentration in [[California]].

The history of Native Hawaiians, like the [[history of Hawaii]], is commonly classified into four major periods:
* the [[Ancient Hawaii|pre-unification period]] (before c. 1800)
* the unified [[Kingdom of Hawaii|monarchy]] and [[Republic of Hawaii|republic]] period (c. 1800 to 1898)
* the [[Territory of Hawaii|US territorial period]] (1898 to 1959)
* the [[Hawaii|US statehood period]] (1959 to present)

==Origins==
One theory is that the first [[Polynesians]] arrived in Hawaii in the 3rd century from the [[Marquesas]] by travelling in groups of [[waka (canoe)|waka]]s, and were followed by [[Tahitians]] in AD 1300, who then conquered the original inhabitants. Another is that a single, extended period of settlement populated the islands.&lt;ref name="KirchGreen2001"&gt;{{cite book |last=Kirch |first=Patrick Vinton |last2=Green |first2=Roger C |title=Hawaiki, ancestral Polynesia : an essay in historical anthropology |publisher=Cambridge University Press |publication-place=Cambridge New York |year=2001 |isbn=9780521783095 |oclc=57218655 |url=http://www.worldcat.org/title/hawaiki-ancestral-polynesia-an-essay-in-historical-anthropology/oclc/462284942/viewport}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Evidence for a Tahitian conquest of the islands include the legends of [[Hawaiiloa|Hawai{{okina}}iloa]] and the navigator-priest [[Paʻao|Pa{{okina}}ao]], who is said to have made a voyage between Hawaii and the island of "Kahiki" (Tahiti) and introduced many customs. Early historians, such as Fornander and Beckwith, subscribed to this Tahitian invasion theory, but later historians, such as Kirch, do not mention it. [[King Kalakaua]] claimed that [[Pa'ao]] was from [[Samoa]].

Some writers claim that other settlers in Hawai{{okina}}i were forced into remote valleys by newer arrivals. They claim that stories about the [[Menehune]], little people who built [[heiau]] and [[Ancient Hawaiian aquaculture|fishponds]], prove the existence of ancient peoples who settled the islands before the Hawaiians.&lt;ref&gt;The best survey of these stories, all collected in the latter part of the 19th century, is found in Beckwith's ''Hawaiian mythology'', pp. 321-336.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Demographics==
{{see also|Hawaii#Demographics}}
At the time of [[James Cook|Captain Cook]]'s arrival in 1778, the population is estimated to have been between 250,000 and 800,000.&lt;ref name="Schmitt"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Schmitt |first=Robert C. |date=June 1971 |title=New Estimates of the Pre-censal Population of Hawaii |journal=[[Polynesian Society|Journal of the Polynesian Society]] |volume=80 |issue=2 |pages=237–243 |location=Auckland, New Zealand |publisher=[[Polynesian Society]] |issn=0032-4000 |oclc=557485930 |accessdate=May 19, 2012 |url=http://hdl.handle.net/2027/mdp.39015012883578 |quote=Contemporary estimates for the date of first contact ranged from 200,000 to 400,000, and retrospective guesses by later historians dipped as low as 100,000.

Native Hawaiians had no resistance to [[influenza]], [[smallpox]], [[measles]], or [[whooping cough]], among others. The [[1900 U.S. Census]] identified 37,656 residents of full or partial native Hawaiian ancestry.&lt;ref name="tab26.pdf"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/population/www/documentation/twps0056/tab26.pdf |title=Table 26.

==Hawaiian language==
{{main|Hawaiian language}}
The Hawaiian language (or ʻŌlelo Hawaiʻi) was once the primary language of the native Hawaiian people; today, native Hawaiians predominantly speak the [[English language]]. A major factor for this change was an 1896 law that required that English "be the only medium and basis of instruction in all public and private schools". This law prevented the Hawaiian language from being taught as a second language. In spite of this, some native Hawaiians (as well as non-native Hawaiians) have learned ʻŌlelo as a second language.&lt;ref name="Warner"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/304242908 |title=I ola ka 'olelo i na keiki: Ka 'apo 'ia 'ana o ka 'olelo Hawai'i e na keiki ma ke Kula Kaiapuni [That the Language Live through the Children: The Acquisition of the Hawaiian Language by the Children in the Immersion School.] (Ph.D. thesis; abstract visible here) |website=ProQuest.com |author=Warner, Sam L. |date=1996 |accessdate=1 May 2018}}{{subscription required|s}}&lt;/ref&gt; As with others local to Hawaii, native Hawaiians often speak [[Hawaiian Creole English]] (referred to in Hawai'i as Pidgin), a creole which developed during Hawaiʻi's plantation era in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries with the influence of the various ethnic groups living in Hawaii during that time.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}

Nowadays ʻŌlelo Hawaiʻi is the official language of the State of Hawaii, alongside [[English language|English]]. The Hawaiian language has been promoted for revival most recently by a state program of cultural preservation enacted in 1978. Programs included the opening of Hawaiian language immersion schools, and the establishment of a Hawaiian language department at the [[University of Hawaiʻi at Mānoa]]. As a result, Hawaiian language learning has climbed among all races in Hawaiʻi.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}

In 2006, the [[University of Hawaii at Hilo]] established a masters program in the Hawaiian Language.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=1143838 Master's Degree in Hawaiian], npr.org&lt;/ref&gt; In fall 2006, they established a doctoral ([[Ph.D]]) program in the Hawaiian Language. In addition to being the first doctoral program for the study of Hawaiian, it is the first doctoral program established for the study of any native language in the [[United States|United States of America]]. Both the masters and doctoral programs are considered by global scholars as pioneering in the revival of native languages.

Hawaiian is still spoken as the primary language by the residents on the private island of [[Niʻihau]].&lt;ref name=Lyovin&gt;{{cite book |last=Lyovin |first=Anatole V |date=1997 |title=An Introduction to the Languages of the World |location=New York |publisher=Oxford University Press, Inc. |page=258 |isbn=0-19-508116-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hawaiʻi Sign Language==
{{main|Hawai'i Sign Language}}
Alongside ʻŌlelo Hawaiʻi, some Maoli (Native Hawaiians) spoke Hawaiʻi Sign Language (or HSL). Little is known about the language by Western academics and efforts are being made to preserve and revitalize the language.

==Education==

{{see also|Hawaii#Education|Hawai'i Department of Education|List of elementary schools in Hawaii|List of middle schools in Hawaii|List of high schools in Hawaii}}

Hawaiian children are publicly educated under the same terms as any other children in the United States. In Hawaii, native Hawaiians are publicly educated by the Hawaiʻi State Department of Education, an ethnically diverse school system that is the United States' largest and most centralized. Hawaiʻi is the only U.S. state without local community control of public schools.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}

Under the administration of Governor [[Benjamin J. Cayetano]] from 1994 to 2002, the state's educational system established special Hawaiian language immersion schools. In these schools, all subject courses are taught in the Hawaiian language and use native Hawaiian subject matter in curricula. These schools were created in the spirit of cultural preservation and are not exclusive to native Hawaiian children.&lt;ref name="Warner"/&gt;

Native Hawaiians are eligible for an education from the [[Kamehameha Schools]], established through the last will and testament of [[Bernice Pauahi Bishop]] of the [[House of Kamehameha|Kamehameha Dynasty]]. The largest and wealthiest private school in the United States, Kamehameha Schools was intended to benefit indigents and orphans, with preference given to native Hawaiians. The Kamehameha Schools provides a quality education to thousands of children of whole and part native Hawaiian ancestry at its campuses during the regular school year, and also has quality summer and off-campus programs that are not restricted by ancestry. Kamehameha Schools' practice of accepting primarily gifted students, in lieu of intellectually challenged children, has been a controversial topic amongst the native Hawaiian community. Many 'rejected' families feel that the gifted students could excel at any learning institution, public or private. Thus, the Hawaiian community may be better served by educating children from high-risk, high-crime districts so that a greater proportion of disadvantaged youths may grow up to be responsible community contributors.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}

As with other children in Hawaiʻi, some native Hawaiians are educated by other prominent private academies in the Aloha State. They include: [[Punahou School]], [[Saint Louis School]], [[Mid-Pacific Institute]], and [[Iolani School]].

==Native Hawaiian Ways of Learning==

Native Hawaiians exemplify patterns of [[Learning by Observing and Pitching In|Learning by Observing and Pitching In (LOPI)]], a model that captures seven interrelated descriptions, or facets, of learning found in Indigenous communities in the Americas.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Rogoff, B. (2014). Learning by Observing and Pitching In to Family and Community Endeavors. Learning by Observing and Pitching In to Family and Community Endeavors: An Orientation, 4(57), 69-81. doi:10.2259/000356757&lt;/ref&gt; Native Hawaiian views on learning flow from three basic tenets that correspond directly to the [[Learning by Observing and Pitching In|LOPI]] model: “''I ka nānā no a ʻike'': by observing, one learns. ''I ka hoʻolohe no a hoʻomaopopo:'' by listening, one commits to memory. ''I ka hana no a ʻike'': by practice one masters the skill.” &lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Pukui, M. K., Haertig, E. W., Lee, C. A., &amp; Queen Liliʻuokalani Children's Center. (1972). Nānā i ke kumu: Look to the source. Honolulu, HI: Hui Hanai.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Learner Incorporated and Contributing'''

Similar to the Indigenous communities of the Americas, Native Hawaiian children enthusiastically contribute alongside the adults, and the adult's presence is there to offer support. In most Native Hawaiian communities, household work tasks, such as ironing and cooking, etc., play a major role in contributing to the home life and children’s participation enhances their importance within the family.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Boggs, Joan. 1968. Hawaiian Adolescents And Their Families. Studies In A Hawaiian Community : Na Makamaka O Nanakuli. Honolulu: Bernice P. Bishop Museum, Dept. of Anthropology. &lt;nowiki&gt;http://ehrafworldcultures.yale.edu/document?id=ov05-021&lt;/nowiki&gt;. ; P. 66 &amp; 72.&lt;/ref&gt; Native Hawaiian children have shared aspirations to accomplish [[Collaboration|collaborative]] tasks, and they individually take initiative to work together.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;Weisner, T. S., Gallimore, R. and Jordan, C. (1988), Unpackaging Cultural Effects on Classroom Learning: Native Hawaiian Peer Assistance and Child-Generated Activity. Anthropology &amp; Education Quarterly, 19: 327–353. doi:10.1525/aeq.1988.19.4.05x0915e&lt;/ref&gt; Children absorb very early the community-wide belief that ''hana'' (work) is respected and laziness is shameful. The phrase “''E hoʻohuli ka lima i lalo''” (The palms of the hands should be turned down) was used to communicate the idea that idleness (associated with upturned palms) was to be avoided.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

'''Collaborative and Flexible Ensembles'''

Native Hawaiian children [[Cooperation|cooperate]] with flexible leadership to combine their skills, ideas, and abilities, like that found in [[Learning by Observing and Pitching In|Learning by Observing and Pitching In (LOPI)]] in the Indigenous Communities of the Americas. Family organization is a “shared-function” system that includes flexible roles and fluid responsibility within the group. Basic family values include interdependence, responsibility for others, sharing of work and resources, obedience, and respect. Children assume important family responsibilities early and act as members of a sibling workforce that is held collectively responsible for completing tasks.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;G. Tharp, Cathie Jordan, Gisela E. Speidel, Kathryn Hu-pei Au, Thomas W. Klein, Roderick P. Calkins, Kim C. M. Sloat, Ronald Gallimore (2007). Education and Native Hawaiian Children: Revisiting KEEP. Hulili,4, 269-318, Retrieved from: &lt;nowiki&gt;http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.569.1814&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Children also take initiative to help others in the classroom.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; It has been observed that when children are working in a group with their peers and face difficulty, they will scan the room for an adult to assist or turn to their close fellows to either ask for help. Children also scan to provide help to others when necessary. In this way, children shift between the roles of assisted and assistant. Adults were present and available, but the children were more often found to take the initiative to learn from, and teach, one another how to perform tasks such as sweeping, homework, and caring for younger siblings.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

'''Learning to Transform Participation'''

Among Native Hawaiians, the goal of learning is to transform [[Youth participation|participation]] to encompass conscientious accountability as active contributing members of the community,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; like that found in [[Learning by Observing and Pitching In|LOPI]]. For example, in some Native Hawaiian communities, parent(s) teach the older siblings the necessary skills of care taking. Sibling care-taking skills can relate to Indigenous American ways of learning by the children becoming considerate of their parents and taking on the responsibility when needed in case of a tragic incident with the parents.&lt;ref&gt;Cicirelli, V. (1994). Sibling Relationships in Cross-Cultural Perspective. Journal of Marriage

and Family,56(1), 7-20. doi:10.2307/352697
&lt;/ref&gt; Within the classroom and home settings, adults are present but are not always directly monitoring the children. Children ask for help when necessary, but adults appear to rarely interject. Children appeared to adapt to tasks and situations by observations and go off on their own to collectively work out how and what to do to complete the task.

[[Fosterage|Assuming and initiating care]] has been found across Polynesian cultures, and Native Hawaiian practices are in keeping with this trend. One study observed, interviewed, and evaluated families on the Polynesian Island Sikaiana and found that fostering children from other families within the community is a common shared endeavor that serves to construct relationships, support the community, and nurture compassion and sympathy [[Aloha|(''aloha'']]).&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;Donner, W. W. (1999). Sharing and Compassion: Fosterage in a Polynesian Society. Journal of Comparative Family Studies, 30(4), autumn, 703-722. Retrieved May 25, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; As children mature within the family, they go through a process of having their needs attended and learn to provide and care for the younger children alongside the adults. Adolescent girls who are active caretakers are referred to as parents, even if there is no biological connection.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

'''Wide and Keen Attention for Contribution'''

The Hawaiians’ ways of learning include wide keen attention from the children while adults are available for guidance, also found in the model of [[Learning by Observing and Pitching In]]. Children were found to learn from adults by participating in group activities where they had the chance to observe the performance of more experienced participants as well as having errors in their own performance corrected by more seasoned group members.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Because the children [[Observational learning|learn through observation]], and then are encouraged to practice among their peers, we can speculate the children have keen attention to events around them, which is an expectation of adults and community members who are there to assist when needed.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; It has been observed that Hawaiian children were successful at completing tasks which greatly depend on visual and memory process skills, which coincides with Hawaiian mother’s frequent use of non-verbal communication.&lt;ref&gt;Speidel, G. E., Farran, D. C., &amp; Jordan, C. (1989). 6: On the Learning and Thinking Styles of Hawaiian Children. In Thinking Across Cultures (pp. 55-77). Hillsdale, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Coordination Through Shared Reference'''

In some Native Hawaiian communities, there is a constant use of [[Storytelling|“talk story”]] which plays an essential role in promoting solidarity in the community by not overpowering or making the members of the community feel inadequate for not understanding something. Talk story can consist of recalled events, folktales, and joking. Joking can be used to tease and guide the children about how to do a chore better or to avoid serious trouble.&lt;ref&gt;Smith-Hefner, N. J. (1987), Speaking Relating and Learning: A Study of Hawaiian Children at Home and at School: Stephen T. Boggs. TESOL Quarterly, 21: 759–763. doi:10.2307/3586993&lt;/ref&gt; Talk story relates to an Indigenous way of learning by providing conversations such as narratives and dramatizations with verbal and nonverbal communication between the elder and children.

Another example of verbal communication in the Native Hawaiian culture is through the use of [[chant]]ing, which can allow a child to understand the relationship of their present experiences to those of their ancestors, both alive and deceased. Chanting also allows children to understand the connections of their chants to mother earth. For instance, chanting can voice the need for rain to produce plants and induce ponds to grow fish for harvest.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;Meyer, Manu Aluli (1998) Native Hawaiian Epistemology: Sites of Empowerment and Resistance, Equity &amp; Excellence in Education, 31:1, 22-28, DOI: 10.1080/1066568980310104&lt;/ref&gt;

A study comparing Midwestern and Hawaiian mother – Kindergartener pairs presented with a novel task,&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; found Hawaiian mothers to be much lower than their Midwestern counterparts in the use of verbal-control techniques and much higher in non-verbal communication, a finding which implies coordination through [[Nonverbal communication|non-verbal]] and verbal means.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Aspects of togetherness, continuity, purpose, and significance are a part of learning and coincide with the Native Hawaiian’s spiritual connection to earth and environment.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

'''Feedback That Appraises Mastery and Support for Learning'''

There is verbal and nonverbal guidance from parents to children with chores and other activities. For example, a pat on the shoulder can communicate to the child that he/she is doing the activity at hand the correct way.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; This example relates to the [[Learning by Observing and Pitching In|LOPI]] model by there being an appraisal from the parent(s) in order to support their progress in learning and contributing better in the community. As the child gradually advances towards more complex tasks, the goal of mastery and feedback on the adequacy of their contributions become more pronounced.

In the context of producing objects e.g. baskets, mats, or quilts, there was a belief that a child must produce a perfect end-product before moving on to learn the skills of producing something else. Perfection in these products was judged by more experienced craftspeople and was attained by repeated attempts interspersed with feedback. The perfected final products were kept as a special reminder and never used. Their production was seen as a necessary first step in “clearing the way” for other products to come; an indication of mastery for that skill set.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Throughout several research articles, it becomes clear that many of the Native Hawaiian ways of learning resemble the defining characteristics of [[Learning by Observing and Pitching In|LOPI]], which is common in many Indigenous communities of the Americas.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Hawaiian cultural revival==

{{see also|Culture of the Native Hawaiians|Hawaii#Culture}}

Native Hawaiian culture has seen a revival in recent years as an outgrowth of decisions made at the [[1978 Hawaiʻi State Constitutional Convention]], held 200 years after the arrival of Captain Cook. At the convention, the Hawaiʻi state government committed itself to a progressive study and preservation of native Hawaiian culture, history, and language.

A comprehensive Hawaiian culture curriculum was introduced into the State of Hawaiʻi's public elementary schools teaching: ancient Hawaiian art, lifestyle, geography, [[hula]], and Hawaiian language vocabulary. Intermediate and high schools were mandated to impose two sets of Hawaiian history curricula on every candidate for graduation.

Statutes and charter amendments were passed acknowledging a policy of preference for Hawaiian place and street names. For example, with the closure of [[Barbers Point Naval Air Station]] in the 1990s, the region formerly occupied by the base was renamed [[Kalaeloa]].

==Office of Hawaiian Affairs==
{{main|Office of Hawaiian Affairs}}
Another important outgrowth of the 1978 Hawaiʻi State Constitutional Convention was the establishment of the Office of Hawaiian Affairs, more popularly known as OHA. Delegates that included future Hawaiʻi political stars [[Benjamin J. Cayetano]], [[John D. Waihee III]], and [[Jeremy Harris (politician)|Jeremy Harris]] enacted measures intended to address injustices toward native Hawaiians since the [[Overthrow of the Hawaiian Kingdom|overthrow of the Kingdom of Hawaiʻi]] in 1893. OHA was established as a trust, administered with a mandate to better the conditions of both native Hawaiians and the Hawaiian community in general. OHA was given control over certain public lands, and continues to expand its land-holdings to this day (most recently with Waimea Valley, previously Waimea Falls Park).&lt;ref name="OHA Waimia Valley press release"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.oha.org/content.asp?contentid=561 |title=OHA gains Waimea Valley title |first=Manu |last=Boyd |date=July 3, 2006 |publisher=[[Office of Hawaiian Affairs]] |location=Honolulu, HI, USA |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060927173615/http://www.oha.org/content.asp?contentid=561 |archivedate=September 27, 2006 |deadurl= |accessdate=May 19, 2012 |quote= |ref= |separator= |postscript=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Besides purchases since its inception, the lands initially given to OHA were originally crown lands of the Kingdom of Hawaiʻi used to pay the expenses of the monarchy (later held by the Provisional Government following the fall of the monarchy in 1893). Upon the declaration of the Republic of Hawaiʻi, they were officially designated as public lands. They were ceded to federal control with the establishment of the [[Territory of Hawaiʻi]] in 1898, and finally returned to the State of Hawaiʻi as public lands in 1959.

OHA is a semi-autonomous government body administered by a nine-member board of trustees, elected by the people of the State of Hawaiʻi through popular suffrage. Originally, trustees and the people eligible to vote for trustees were restricted to native Hawaiians. [[Rice v. Cayetano]]—suing the state to allow non-Hawaiians to sit on the board of trustees, and for non-Hawaiians to be allowed to vote in trustee elections—reached the [[United States Supreme Court]], which ruled in favor of Rice on February 23, 2000, forcing OHA to open its elections to all residents of the State of Hawaiʻi, regardless of ethnicity.

==Federal developments==

===Native American Programs Act===
In 1974, the Native American Programs Act was amended to include native Hawaiians. This paved the way for native Hawaiians to become eligible for some, but not all, federal assistance programs originally intended for [[Native Americans in the United States|Continental Native Americans]]. Today, Title 45 CFR Part 1336.62 defines a Native Hawaiian as "an individual any of whose ancestors were natives of the area which consists of the Hawaiian Islands prior to 1778".

There is some controversy as to whether or not native Hawaiians should be considered in the same light as Native Americans.&lt;ref name="Indian Country Today"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Editors Report |date=August 13, 2001 |title=Native Hawaiian recognition is overdue |journal=[[Indian Country Today]] |volume= |series= |issue= |page= |pages= |at= |chapter= |location=New York, NY, USA |publisher=Indian Country Today Media Network |id={{oclc|61312545|43291273}} |issn=0744-2238 |accessdate=May 19, 2012 |url=http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/ictarchives/2001/08/13/native-hawaiian-recognition-is-overdue-84826 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061025002449/http://www.indiancountry.com/content.cfm?id=73 |archivedate=October 25, 2006 |deadurl=no |quote=Native Hawaiians have rightfully demanded recognition of their aboriginal standing by the United States.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=conklin&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kenconklin.org/mediawiki/index.php?title=Are_kanaka_maoli_indigenous_to_Hawai%27i%3F|title=Are kanaka maoli indigenous to Hawai'i?|work=kenconklin.org|accessdate=June 16, 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150501082145/http://kenconklin.org/mediawiki/index.php?title=Are_kanaka_maoli_indigenous_to_Hawai%27i%3F|archivedate=May 1, 2015|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States apology resolution===
On November 23, 1993, [[President of the United States|U.S. President]] [[Bill Clinton]] signed United States Public Law 103-150, also known as the [[Apology Resolution]], which had previously passed Congress. This resolution "apologizes to Native Hawaiians on behalf of the people of the United States for the overthrow of the Kingdom of Hawaii".&lt;ref&gt;[[s:US Public Law 103-150]]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Native Hawaiian Government Reorganization Act of 2009===
In the early 2000s, the Congressional delegation of the State of Hawaiʻi introduced the Native Hawaiian Federal Recognition Bill, beginning the process of [[US federal recognition of Native Hawaiians|recognizing and forming a Native Hawaiian government]] entity to negotiate with state and federal governments. The significance of the bill is that it would establish, for the first time in the history of the islands, a new political and legal relationship between a Native Hawaiian entity and the federal government. This Native Hawaiian entity would be a newly created one without any historical precedent in the islands, or direct institutional continuity with previous political entities (unlike many Native American Indian groups, for example).{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}

This bill came under scrutiny by the Bush administration's Department of Justice, as well as the United States Senate Judiciary Committee. The political context surrounding the Akaka Bill is both controversial and complex. Proponents, who consider the legislation an acknowledgement and partial correction of past injustices, include Hawaiʻi's Congressional delegation, as well as the former [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] Governor, [[Linda Lingle]]. Opponents include the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights, (who question the constitutionality of creating race-based governments), libertarian activists, (who challenge the historical accuracy of any claims of injustice), and other Native [[Hawaiian sovereignty movement|Hawaiian sovereignty activists]], (who feel the legislation would thwart their hopes for complete independence from the United States).{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}

A Ward Research poll commissioned in 2003 by the Office of Hawaiian Affairs reported that "Eighty-six percent of the 303 Hawaiian residents polled by Ward Research said 'yes.' Only 7 percent said 'no,' with 6 percent unsure ... Of the 301 non-Hawaiians polled, almost eight in 10 (78 percent) supported federal recognition, 16 percent opposed it, with 6 percent unsure."&lt;ref name="Apoliona"&gt;{{cite news |url= http://archives.starbulletin.com/2005/04/03/editorial/commentary3.html |title=Another Perspective: Scientific poll shows majority favors Hawaiian programs |first=Haunani |last=Apoliona |newspaper=[[Honolulu Star-Bulletin]] |location=Honolulu, HI, USA |publisher= [[Black Press|Black Press Group Ltd]] |issn=0439-5271|id={{OCLC|9188300|433678262|232117605|2268098}} |date=April 3, 2005 |accessdate=June 2, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[IBOPE Zogby International|Zogby International]] poll commissioned in 2009 by the [[Grassroot Institute|Grassroot Institute of Hawaii]] indicated that a plurality (39%) of Hawaiʻi residents opposed the Native Hawaiian Reorganization Act of 2009, and that 76% indicated that they were unwilling to pay higher taxes to cover any loss in tax revenues that might be incurred by the act.&lt;ref name="Zogby-Grassroot"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://grassrootinstitute.org/system/attachments/32/FINAL_topline_Grassroot_Institute_of_Hawaii_11-30-2.pdf |title=Results from Zogby International interactive poll commissioned by the Grassroot Institute of Hawaii |others=[[IBOPE Zogby International|Zogby International]] |work=grassrootinstitute.org |first=Cheryl |last=Korn |publisher=[[Grassroot Institute|Grassroot Institute of Hawaii]] |location=Honolulu, Hawaii |date=November 24, 2009 |accessdate=June 2, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101223043001/http://grassrootinstitute.org/system/attachments/32/FINAL_topline_Grassroot_Institute_of_Hawaii_11-30-2.pdf |archivedate=December 23, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ka Huli Ao: Center for Excellence in Native Hawaiian Law===
In 2005, with the support of Senator Daniel Inouye, federal funding through the Native Hawaiian Education Act created the [http://law.hawaii.edu/kahuliao Center for Excellence in Native Hawaiian Law] at the University of Hawaiʻi at Mānoa's [[William S. Richardson School of Law]]. A few years later, the program became known as Ka Huli Ao: Center for Excellence in Native Hawaiian Law. The inaugural director of Ka Huli Ao is Honolulu attorney [http://www.law.hawaii.edu/personnel/mackenzie/melody Melody Kapilialoha MacKenzie]. MacKenzie is also recognized as the chief editor of the Native Hawaiian Rights Handbook, which is a legal publication that describes Native Hawaiian law, a subset of laws of the State of Hawaiʻi. MacKenzie worked as a clerk to the school of lawʻs namesake, William S. Richardson, for four years, and also served as the Executive Director of the Native Hawaiian Legal Corporation for four years, then worked as a senior staff attorney for another six years.

Ka Huli Ao focuses on research, scholarship, and community outreach. Ka Huli Ao provides a monthly lunch-time discussion forum referred to as ''Maoli Thursday'', which is free and open to the public. Ka Huli Ao maintains its own [http://uhm-nativehawaiianlaw.blogspot.com/ blog], as well as a Twitter account and a Facebook group. Ka Huli Ao also provides law students with summer fellowships. Law school graduates are eligible to apply for post-J.D. fellowships that last for one year.

==Notable Native Hawaiians==
{{main|List of Native Hawaiians}}

In 1873 the first native Hawaiian's were given permission from King Lunalilo (prior emigration of native Hawaiians was not allowed) to permanently emigrate to the United States (Salt Lake City, Utah) whose names were Kiha Kaawa, and Kahana Pukahi. Kiha was adopted by Mormon Missionary President George Nebeker immediately upon arrival making Kiha Kaawa(Nebeker) the first native Hawaiian to become a US citizen in 1873.

==Culture and arts==
{{main|Culture of the Native Hawaiians}}
[[File:Native Hawaiian man pounding taro into poi with two children by his sides., c. 1890s.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|right|Hawaiian man with his two children, circa 1890.]]
Several cultural preservation societies and organizations have been established over the course of the twentieth century. The largest of those institutions is the Bernice Pauahi [[Bishop Museum]], established in 1889 and designated as the Hawaiʻi State Museum of Natural and Cultural History. Bishop Museum houses the largest collection of native Hawaiian artifacts, documents, and other information available for educational use. Most objects are held for preservation alone. The museum has links with major colleges and universities throughout the world to facilitate research.

With the support of the Bishop Museum, the [[Polynesian Voyaging Society]]'s double-hulled canoe, ''[[Hokulea|Hōkūle&amp;lsquo;a]]'', has contributed to rediscovery of native Hawaiian culture, especially in the revival of non-instrument navigation, by which ancient Polynesians originally settled Hawaiʻi.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hawaiireef.noaa.gov/heritage/welcome.html|title=Hawaiian Cultural Heritage|last=Unattributed|date=July 25, 2007|work=Papahānaumokuākea Marine National Monument|publisher=United States [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]]|language=en-US, haw|accessdate=September 6, 2008|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080916044123/http://www.hawaiireef.noaa.gov/heritage/welcome.html|archivedate=September 16, 2008|df=mdy-all}} Discusses ''Hōkūle&amp;lsquo;a's'' ''[[Hokulea#2003 - 2004 Navigating Change project|Navigating Change]]'' voyage which also raised consciousness of the interdependence of Hawaiians, their environment, and their culture.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
One of the most commonly known arts of Hawaii is [[hula]] dancing. It is an interpretive dance, famous for its grace and romantic feel, that expresses stories and feelings from almost any phase of life.

In the [[Psychoanalysis|psychoanalytic]] theory of [[Jacques Lacan]], '''''objet petit a''''' stands for the unattainable object of [[desire (psychoanalysis)|desire]]. It is sometimes called the object cause of desire. Lacan always insisted that the term should remain untranslated, "thus acquiring the status of an algebraic sign" (''Écrits'').

'The "a" in question stands for "''autre''" (other), the concept having been developed out of the Freudian "object" and Lacan's own exploitation of "otherness." &lt;ref&gt;Alan Sheridan, "Translator's Note", Jacques Lacan, ''The Four Fundamental Concepts of Psycho-analysis'' (London 1994) p. 282&lt;/ref&gt;

==Psychoanalytic origins==

[[Jacques-Alain Miller]] pointed to the origins of object (a) in [[Freud]]'s 'lost object...the function that Freud discovered in the ''Three Essays''...and that [[Karl Abraham]] made the crux of his theory of development from which he derived the first premises of the "partial object"'.&lt;ref&gt;Jacques-Alain Miller, "Microscopia", in Jacques Lacan, ''Television'' (London 1990) p. xxxi&lt;/ref&gt;

Thereafter, according to Miller, [[Melanie Klein]] 'located the partial object at the centre of psychic economy...hence it was that [[Winnicott]] glimpsed the [[transitional object]].' &lt;ref&gt;Miller, "Microscopia" p. xxxi&lt;/ref&gt; That long prehistory of object relations 'is what Lacan sums up, condenses, justifies and constructs with object ''a''.' &lt;ref&gt;Miller, "Microscopia" p. xxxi&lt;/ref&gt;

==Lacanian development==

'In Lacan's seminars of the late 1950s and early 1960s, the evolving concept of the ''objet (petit) a'' is viewed in the ''[[matheme]]'' of phantasy as the object of desire sought in the other...a deliberate departure from British Object Relations psychoanalysis'.&lt;ref&gt;Mary Jacobus, ''The Poetics of Psychoanalysis'' (Oxford 2005) p. 26n&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1957, in his Seminar ''Les formations de l'inconscient'', Lacan introduces the concept of ''objet petit a'' as the (Kleinian) imaginary part-object, an element which is imagined as separable from the rest of the body. In the Seminar ''Le transfert'' (1960–1961) he articulates objet a with the term ''agalma'' (Greek, an ornament). Just as the ''agalma'' is a precious object hidden in a worthless box, so ''objet petit a'' is the object of desire which we seek in the [[Other (philosophy)|Other]]. The "box" can take many forms, all of which are unimportant, the importance lies in what is "inside" the box, the cause of desire.

In the Seminars ''L'angoisse'' (1962–1963) and [[The Four Fundamental Concepts of Psychoanalysis]] (1964), ''objet petit a'' is defined as the leftover, the remnant left behind by the introduction of the Symbolic in the [[Jacques Lacan#The Real|Real]]. This is further elaborated in the Seminar ''The Other Side of Psychoanalysis'' (1969–1970), where Lacan elaborates his [[Four discourses]]. In the discourse of the Master, one signifier attempts to represent the subject for all other signifiers, but a surplus is always produced: this surplus is ''objet petit a'', a surplus meaning, a surplus of [[jouissance]].

[[Slavoj Žižek]] explains this ''objet petit a'' in relation to [[Alfred Hitchcock]]'s [[MacGuffin]]: "[The] MacGuffin is ''objet petit a'' pure and simple: the lack, the remainder of the [[Jacques Lacan#The Real|Real]] that sets in motion the symbolic movement of interpretation, a hole at the center of the [[The Symbolic|symbolic order]], the mere appearance of some secret to be explained, interpreted, etc." (''Love thy symptom as thyself'').

==Hierarchy of ''object (a)''==

Speaking of the "fall" of the ''a'', Lacan noted that 'the diversity of forms taken by that object of the fall ought to be related to the manner in which the desire of the Other is apprehended by the subject.' &lt;ref&gt;Jacques Lacan, ''Television'' (London 1990) p. 85&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest form is 'something that is called the breast...this breast in its function as object, ''object a'' cause of desire.' &lt;ref&gt;Jacques Lacan, ''The Four Fundamental Concepts of Psycho-analysis'' (London 1994) p. 168&lt;/ref&gt;

Next there emerges 'the second form: the anal object. We know it by way of the phenomenology of the gift, the present offered in anxiety.' &lt;ref&gt;Jacques Lacan, "Introduction to the Names-of-the-Father Seminar", in ''Television'' p. 85&lt;/ref&gt; The third form appears 'at the level of the genital act...[where] Freudian teaching, and the tradition that has maintained it, situates for us the gaping chasm of castration.' &lt;ref&gt;Lacan, "Introduction" p. 85-6&lt;/ref&gt;

Lacan also identified 'the function of ''petit a'' at the level of the scopophilic drive. Its essence is realized in so far as, more than elsewhere, the subject is captive of the function of desire.' &lt;ref&gt;Lacan, "Introduction" p. 86&lt;/ref&gt; The final term relates to 'the ''petit a'' source of the [[Id, ego, and super-ego|superego]]...the fifth term of the function of ''petit a'', through which will be revealed the gamut of the object in its - pregenital - relation to the demand of the - post-genital - Other.' &lt;ref&gt;Lacan, "Introduction" p. 87&lt;/ref&gt;

==Analyst and the ''a''==

For [[transference]] to take place, the analyst must incorporate the ''a'' for the analysand: 'analysts who are such only insofar as they are object - the object of the analysand'.&lt;ref&gt;Lacan, ''Television'' p. 4&lt;/ref&gt; For Lacan, 'it is not enough that the analyst should support the function of [[Tiresias]]. He must also, as [[Apollinaire]] tells us, have breasts' &lt;ref&gt;Jacques Lacan, ''The Four Fundamental Concepts of Psycho-analysis'' (London 1994) p. 270&lt;/ref&gt; - must represent or incorporate the (missing) object of desire.

Working through the transference thereafter entails moving 'beyond the function of the ''a''': the 'analyst has to...be the support of the separating ''a'',' &lt;ref&gt;Lacan ''Concepts'' p. 273&lt;/ref&gt; so as to allow the analysis eventually to be completed. 'If the analyst during the analysis will come to be this object, he will also at the end of analysis not be it. He will submit himself to the fate of any object that stands in for ''a'', and that is to be discarded.' &lt;ref&gt;Stuart Schneiderman, ''Returning to Freud'' (New York 1980) p. 8&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''Saint Vincent Panels''''', or the ''Adoration of Saint Vincent'' panels, are a [[polyptych]] consisting of six panels that were perhaps painted in the 1450s. They are attributed to the [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] [[Painting|painter]] [[Nuno Gonçalves]], who was active from 1450 to 1471. Traditionally, the polyptych is dated to the 1450s due to the putative prominence of Prince [[Henry the Navigator]] among the persons represented in the panels (Henry died in 1460). Controversy concerning the true nature of Henry's presence in the panels - if any - along with the inclusion of figures that can be identified as his brothers, all of whom died before 1450, renders it difficult to assign any secure date for the creation of the panels other than sometime during the ''[[floruit]]'' of the painter Gonçalves.

The original retable, during its stay in the Cathedral of Lisbon, contained "over twelve" panels, as a source from 1767 states.&lt;ref&gt;Adriano de Gusmão, Nuno Gonçalves; The Burlington Magazine Vol. 98, No. 638 (May, 1956), pp. 166+169&lt;/ref&gt; They were displayed in the cathedral at least until 1690 and were set aside in the cathedral until 1742. They were then transferred to the palace of Mitra, where they escaped the devastating [[1755 Lisbon earthquake|earthquake of Lisbon in 1755]].

The panels are now housed in the [[Museu Nacional de Arte Antiga]] (National Museum of Antique Art), in [[Lisbon]], [[Portugal]].

== Discovery ==

Found during the late 1880s in the [[monastery]] of [[Monastery of São Vicente de Fora|Saint Vicente de Fora]] in Lisbon, the panels depict scenes associated with the veneration of [[Vincent of Saragossa|Saint Vincent of Saragossa]]. This polyptych consists of six separate panels of [[oak]] painted with oil or [[tempera]].

The only reference that art historians can use to support the attribution of the creation of the panels to the painter Gonçalves was written in the 16th century by [[Francisco de Holanda]].&lt;ref&gt;Francisco de Holanda, Da pintura antiga (Lisbon, 1548)&lt;/ref&gt; The reference mentions a great work of art made by him that is inferred to be these panels. There has also been speculation that the father of [[Hugo van der Goes]] collaborated in the painting of the panels, but no firm evidence to support this hypothesis exists.  In any case, the ''Saint Vincent Panels'' are regarded as the greatest achievement of pre-modern Portuguese art.

[[File:Nuno Gonçalves. Paineis de São Vicente de Fora.jpg|thumb|center|750px|''Saint Vincent Panels''. From left to right: Panel of the Friars, Panel of the Fishermen, Panel of the Prince, Panel of the Archbishop, Panel of the Knights, and Panel of the Relic]]

==Interpretations ==

Since their discovery in the late 19th century, there has been a continuing dispute over the identity of the painter and the subjects portrayed on the panels. Some basic questions, still unanswered, are these:

* What scene, or scenes, are depicted in the panels?
* Who are the sixty persons portrayed?
* What symbolism is expressed in the panels?
* Who commissioned these panels to be painted?

The majority of experts who have studied this polyptych agree that the panels display several social groups of 15th-century Portugal. They also agree that the children of King [[John I of Portugal|John I]] are represented on these panels, but there is disagreement about their placement and identity.

=== Panel of the Prince: alternative hypothesis ===

[[Image:Painéis de São Vicente3.jpg|thumb|right|220px|The third panel - Panel of the Prince]]

One of the more controversial issues concerning the panels is the depiction of Prince [[Henry the Navigator]]. At first glance, the appearance of the man in black in the third panel is quite compatible with traditional conceptions of Prince Henry's likeness: a man with a light moustache and distinctive black [[Chaperon (headgear)|round chaperon]] such as can be found in numerous representations today. However, there are strong reasons to doubt that this is him.&lt;ref name="Marques"&gt;António Salvador Marques, 1998, [http://paineis.org/INDICE.htm Painéis de S. Vicente de Fora] (accessed 15-8-2010)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Henry the Navigator (Cronicas).jpg|thumb|left|150px|Frontispiece in Zurara's ''Crónicas dos Feitos de Guiné'' (Paris codex)]]
The most basic problem in identifying the man-in-the-chaperon in the Saint Vincent Panels derives from the lack of confirmed portraits of Prince Henry that date from his lifetime. The only other 15th-century image of the man-in-the-chaperon is found in the frontispiece of a copy (currently held by the [[Bibliothèque nationale de France]]) of [[Gomes Eanes de Zurara]]'s ''Crónicas dos Feitos de Guiné'', written in 1453.&lt;ref name="Marques"/&gt; Zurara's book is an account of the early [[Portuguese discoveries]] in Africa along with a [[hagiography]] of Prince Henry, to whom the author assigned singular credit for the discoveries. As a result, it has been assumed that the frontispiece depicts Henry, especially since the motto underneath it seems to have been Henry's own.
 
One alternative hypothesis postulates that the man-in-the-chaperon in Zurara's book might actually be King [[Edward of Portugal]] (r. 1431-38), Prince Henry's brother.&lt;ref name="Marques"/&gt; It has been pointed out that critical phases of the discoveries were launched during his reign, and it would not be unusual for a portrait of a king to adorn a chronicle of events that occurred during his reign.

This alternative hypothesis can be used to help clarify the identity of the figures  surrounding St. Vincent in the Panel of the Prince. Specifically, it offers an explanation for the symmetrical arrangement of men and women as pairings of kings and queens. In this interpretation, the standing pair would be King Edward (in a black chaperon), standing at the right and balanced on the left by his wife, Queen [[Eleanor of Aragon, Queen of Portugal|Eleanor of Aragon]]. Below them would be their son, King [[Afonso V of Portugal]], kneeling on the right and facing his consort, Queen [[Isabella of Coimbra]], who is kneeling on the left. The boy in the panel would then be Edward's heir, the future King [[John II of Portugal]].&lt;ref name="Marques"/&gt;

This alternative hypothesis seems more logical than the original hypothesis that insists on identifying the man-in-the-chaperon as Prince Henry. Since Henry was a bachelor, it is not obvious what woman would be suitable to pair with him as the standing figure on the left. His closest female relatives were his mother [[Philippa of Lancaster|Philippa]] and sister, [[Isabella of Portugal (1397–1471)|Isabella]], Duchess of Burgundy, both of whom would be more properly paired with their husbands. Moreover, Isabella did not live in Portugal after 1430, thus her lack of involvement with Portuguese society at the time the panel was painted would probably disqualify her from inclusion. If the uncle of a king were to be incorporated in the panel, it would more properly be [[Peter, Duke of Coimbra]], who was once the regent of Afonso V and the father of his bride.

Another interpretation of the figures includes Henry in the panel, but proposes Edward as the kneeling king and Afonso V as the boy. Regardless, all traditional means of explaining Henry's presence in the panel strike one as forced, formulated simply to accommodate a preconceived notion that Henry must be the man-in-the-chaperon. Since Edward was the brother of Henry, it is perfectly possible that he bore a close enough resemblance to Henry that the traditional identification in the Zurara book is perfectly correct, and that Edward's appearance in the panel is only coincidentally similar to what is depicted for Henry in the Zurara book.

The alternative hypothesis with King Edward as the man-in-the-chaperon is more logical; pairs of kings and queens are all that are featured in the panel, with no intrusion from other family members, except for the minor son of one of the royal pairs.  Other relatives are featured in a panel of their own (see below). In consideration of this, the Panel of the Prince perhaps ought to be called the Panel of Kings instead, with the king intended to be featured most prominently apparently Afonso V, who was the reigning king of Portugal throughout the ''floruit'' of Nuno Gonçalves, thus the most likely candidate as patron for the preparation of the panels.

=== Panel of the Knights: alternative hypothesis ===

[[Image:Nuño Gonçalves 001.jpg|thumb|right|150px|The fifth panel - Panel of the Knights]]

Hypotheses that assert Henry the Navigator is not the man-in-the-chaperon identify him in another panel: the fifth panel known as the "Panel of the Knights". This alternative interpretation posits that the four knights featured in the panel are the four younger brothers of King [[Edward of Portugal]],&lt;ref name="Marques"/&gt; as follows:
* On the right is [[Infante Peter, Duke of Coimbra|Peter, Duke of Coimbra]], who was prince regent during the minority of Afonso V; he is wearing a belt of the [[Order of the Garter]]. 
* On the left is [[John, Constable of Portugal|John of Reguengos]], Constable of Portugal, in the red color and blade-holding pose typical of the [[Order of Saint James of the Sword]], of which he was the master.
* On top, helmeted and bearded in black, is [[Ferdinand the Holy Prince]], who died after spending many years as a hostage in a Moroccan prison.  His beard, long hair and emaciated face may reflect his long captivity.  It is possible that the reflection on his helmet is intended to represent the end of a Moorish prison window or (in conjunction with his beard), a [[Cross fleury]], the badge of the [[Order of Aviz]], of which he was the master.
* Below, kneeling in purple, is Prince [[Henry the Navigator]], master of the [[Order of Christ (Portugal)|Order of Christ]], with what seems like that order's cross pendant on his neck and a loose belt of the Order of the Garter.  The face of this grey-haired Henry is very different from traditional portrayals.

There has also been much discussion around the possible political significances of this panel.&lt;ref name="Marques"/&gt; It seems, in particular, that by the poses, this panel aims to humiliate Henry the Navigator, possibly for allying himself with [[Afonso, 1st Duke of Braganza|Afonso of Braganza]] against his full brother Peter, Duke of Coimbra, in the [[Battle of Alfarrobeira]] in 1449.  These features of the portrait have been noted: 
* Henry is on his knees, seemingly begging for forgiveness, while Peter and John seem to "stand guard" over him.  
* The pendant Order of Christ cross around Henry's neck is broken.
* Henry's garter belt is untied and disheveled, whereas Peter's is worn properly. 
* The pommel of Henry's sword is twisted, dull and draped in black thread, whereas Peter and John's swords are shiny, laced with gold and silver threads.
* Henry's head is penitently uncovered, whereas Peter and John wear the caps of nobles.
* Peter and John are wearing white gloves, perhaps to denote guilt-free "clean hands", whereas Henry is ungloved.
* Henry seems to gaze straight across to another panel, as if her were asking forgiveness from the royal dynasty he had "wronged", whereas Peter and John look at the spectators.

It is worth remarking that the colors chosen for the princes seem to match the [[liturgical colors]] of the [[Roman rite]]—black (Ferdinand) for mourning of the dead, green (Peter) for ordinary, red (John) for passion and sacrifice and purple (Henry) for penance and mortification.&lt;ref&gt;"Liturgical Colors" at Catholic Encyclopedia [http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04134a.htm online]&lt;/ref&gt;

If this interpretation is valid, then the polyptych of St. Vincent may very well have been conceived by Nuno Gonçalves as a piece of anti-Braganza political propaganda, one possible reason it might have remained hidden for years.&lt;ref name="Marques"/&gt; It would also set up a ''[[terminus post quem]]'' for the creation of the panels; they would have to have been painted after 1449 (the date of the Battle of Alfarrobeira). That would tend to support the traditional belief that they date from the 1450s (when passions left over from that conflict would still have been fresh), however if the boy depicted in the Panel of the Prince can be identified as the future King John II (b. 1455), his height and appearance would certainly indicate a child older than five years' old, thus a date in the 1460s would be more likely.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5768">[[File:Abraham Teniers - Kaartspelende apen.jpg|thumb|270px|''Card playing monkeys'', [[Abraham Teniers]], mid-17th century]]
'''''Singerie''''' is the name given to a visual arts [[genre]] depicting [[monkeys]] imitating human behavior, often fashionably attired, intended as a diverting sight, always with a gentle cast of mild [[satire]].  The term is derived from the [[French language|French]] word for "Monkey Trick".

==History==
The practise can be traced as far back as Ancient Egypt; [[Cyril Aldred]] detected a love of ''singerie'' that he found characteristic of the late [[Eighteenth Dynasty of Egypt]];&lt;ref&gt;Cyril Alfred, 1955. ''New Kingdom Art in Ancient Egypt''&lt;/ref&gt;  Throughout the medieval period in Europe, monkeys were seen "as a symbol of downgraded humanity",&lt;ref name="Duffy2003"&gt;{{cite book|author=Jean H. Duffy|title=Signs and Designs: Art and Architecture in the Work of Michel Butor|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=c1CgfS5boKoC&amp;pg=PA267|year=2003|publisher=Liverpool University Press|isbn=978-0-85323-788-4|pages=267–}}&lt;/ref&gt; and were used to mimic man and his foibles, often appearing in the margins of illuminated manuscripts.&lt;ref name="Garnier-PelleForray-Carlier2011"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Nicole Garnier-Pelle|author2=Anne Forray-Carlier|author3=Marie-Christine Anselm|title=The Monkeys of Christophe Huet: Singeries in French Decorative Arts|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FxxvkgAACAAJ|year=2011|publisher=J. Paul Getty Museum|isbn=978-1-60606-065-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Taylor1807"&gt;{{cite book|author=Charles Taylor|title=The Literary Panorama|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=A94RAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PT427|year=1807|pages=427|quote=The prayer book written for Charles V. of Austria by his mistress, had, on every page, monkeys mimicking religious ceremonies, in the most incongruous manner}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Comical scenes with monkeys appearing in human attire and a human environment originated as a pictorial genre in [[Flemish painting]] in the 16th century and were further developed in the 17th century. The Flemish engraver [[Pieter van der Borcht the Elder|Pieter van der Borcht]] introduced the singerie as an independent theme around 1575 in a series of prints, which are strongly embedded in the artistic tradition of [[Pieter Bruegel the Elder]].  These prints were widely disseminated and the theme was then picked up by other Flemish artists, in particular by those in Antwerp such as [[Frans Francken the Younger]], [[Jan Brueghel the Elder]] and [[Jan Brueghel the Younger|the Younger]], [[Sebastiaen Vrancx]] and [[Jan van Kessel the Elder]]. [[David Teniers the Younger]] became the principal practitioner of the genre and developed it further with his younger brother [[Abraham Teniers]].  The two brothers were able to cater to the prevailing taste in the art market and were thus instrumental in spreading the genre outside Flanders.  Later in the 17th century artists like [[Nicolaes van Verendael]], principally known as a painter of flower [[still life]]s started to paint ‘monkey scenes’ as well.&lt;ref&gt;Bert Schepers, ''Monkey Madness in Seventeenth-Century Antwerp'', in: The Rubenianum Quarterly, 2012 2, p. 5&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Antoine Watteau 032.jpg|thumb|left|A copy of ''The Monkey Sculptor'', originally painted c. 1710 by [[Jean-Antoine Watteau|Antoine Watteau]]]] 
''Singeries'' became popular among French artists in the early 18th century. French decorator and designer [[Jean Berain the Elder]] included dressed figures of monkeys in many wall decorations, the great royal ''[[ébéniste]]'' [[André Charles Boulle]] used them in his work&lt;ref&gt;R.H.

A complete monkey orchestra was produced in [[Meissen porcelain]]. In France the most famous such rococo decor are [[Christophe Huet]]'s ''Grande Singerie'' and ''Petite Singerie'' decors at the [[Château de Chantilly]]; in England the French painter [[Andieu de Clermont]] is also known for his ''singeries'': the most famous decorates the ceiling of the Monkey Room at Monkey Island Hotel, located on [[Monkey Island, Bray|Monkey Island]] in [[Bray-on-Thames]], [[England]]. The Grade I listed buildings, which have housed guests since 1840 were built in the 1740s by [[Charles Spencer, 3rd Duke of Marlborough]].

Singeries regained popularity in the 19th century and artists then successful in this genre included [[Zacharie Noterman]], [[Emmanuel Noterman]], Sir Edwin [[Henry Landseer]], [[Edmund Bristow]], [[Alexandre-Gabriel Decamps]], Charles Monginot and [[Paul Friedrich Meyerheim]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artoftheprint.com/artistpages/noterman_zacharias_the_litigants.htm Zacharias Noterman, ''Les Plaideurs ('The Litigants')] at Art of the Print&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sten Konow''' (17 April 1867&amp;nbsp;– 29 June 1948) was a Norwegian [[Indologist]].
He was professor of Indic philology at the [[University of Oslo|Christiania University]], [[Oslo]], from 1910, moving to [[Hamburg University]] in 1914, where he was professor for Indian history and culture. He returned to Oslo as professor for Indian languages and history in 1919.

He translated [[Rajasekhara]]'s ''Karpuramanjari'', which was published as volume 4 of the [[Harvard Oriental Series]] in 1901.

[[File:GeorgeStephenson.PNG|thumb|[[George Stephenson]] - the English Civil Engineer who built the first railway line in the world to use steam-powered locomotives and known as the 'Father of Railways' - was just one of Britain's globally significant transport visionaries.]]

The '''Transport Trust''' is a British [[registered charity]] that aims to encourage the preservation of, and public interest in, artefacts and records of British transport history.&lt;ref&gt;
http://www.transporttrust.com&lt;/ref&gt;

The Trust seeks to act as a hub for the transport preservation movement, providing advice and assistance, organising public events, and working to secure suitable accommodation and maintenance facilities for historic items. The Trust was founded in 1965.

==Objectives==

The Trust is a registered charity that supports restoration campaigns and projects.

The Trust also offers legal and technical advice to conservation groups and bodies such as [[Heritage Link]], the [[Heritage Lottery Fund]] and the [[UK Government]]. It presents annual restoration awards &lt;ref&gt;http://www.transporttrust.com/awards&lt;/ref&gt; and has a particular mission to encourage young people to take part in restoration projects. The Trust's Patron is [[Prince Michael of Kent]].

==Pressures on heritage preservation==

The [[Heritage Lottery Fund]] commissioned the Transport Trust to assess pressures on the transport heritage movement, and the state of artefacts and locations to help them prioritise applications for funding support. The resulting 145 page report,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|author=Heritage Lottery Fund
|title=Transport Heritage: An Assessment of Needs and Potential |url=http://www.hlf.org.uk/NR/rdonlyres/72515D6F-7F5E-43F3-8DE6-C8C392A0401B/0/Transport_report_full.PDF

|archivedate=10 June 2008
|accessdate=21 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Transport Heritage: An Assessment of Needs &amp; Potential', provides a unique snapshot of the health of the transport preservation movement in Britain. The movement '''is''' important, touching people at many levels and has a wide appeal - it is estimated that audiences and participants in heritage transport activities exceed '''15 million people a year''', making it '''one of Britain's most important leisure activities'''. Britain's particularly rich transport history has no doubt played a catalytic role to build up this level of grass roots participation. [[File:LAA – Elly Sallingboe.JPG|thumb|Elly Sallingboe was awarded the Transport Trust Lifetime Achievement Award in 2008 in recognition of over thirty years of dedication to the preservation and operation of Britain's only airworthy [[Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress]] - the '[[Sally B]]' - as a flying memorial to the tens of thousands of American aircrew who lost their lives over Britain and mainland Europe in her sister aircraft during the Second World War.]]

Surprisingly, although there are good collections of artefacts in public sector museums, it is the private sector preservationists that have made the most significant contribution to conservation and to the provision of the active enjoyment of transport by the public. A supreme example is the restoration to flight status of [[Avro Vulcan XH558]], which represents the most complex restoration project ever undertaken globally, was funded entirely by public donations and for which the Chief Executive of the [[Vulcan To The Sky Trust]], Dr Robert Pleming, was presented the Transport Trust Preservationist of The Year award by [[Prince Michael of Kent]].

The key conclusions for each major transport area were:

===Aviation===
The widespread preservation of aircraft in the UK began in the 1960s when a large number of obsolete military aircraft became available. A push to co-ordinate the movement led to founding of the [[British Aviation Preservation Council]] (BAPC) in 1967, but very few private collections are represented. Although over 2,500 aircraft survive and are capable of preservation, little progress has been made to develop a clear preservation strategy, with 4% of the highest graded and as many as 26% of the second kept outside. Historically, insufficient attention has also been paid to preserving airfield architecture, although the designation in 2007 of Duxford Aerodrome as a [[Conservation Area]] will help preserve a virtually intact site, first established as a Royal Flying Corps base in 1916 and fully operational as an RAF base until 1961. This [[Battle of Britain]] airfield, home to [[Douglas Bader]]'s [[Big Wing]] experiments and the first [[RAF]] base to receive the [[Supermarine Spitfire]], now houses the [[Imperial War Museum Duxford]], the largest centre of European aviation history and home to the largest collection of American aircraft outside of the US.

The key needs for the aviation category are to prioritise individual aircraft for preservation; to move middle grade airframes into hangarage; to pay greater attention to civil aircraft; to deal with pressing gaps in conservation skills.

===Buses and coaches===
There are about 4,000 buses and coaches in preservation of which some 45% are in a recognised collection or museum, private or public, but less than 30% are restored. Most in museums are from the 1950s and 1960s, with only 10% from before 1940, but
over 80% of the total are owned by private individuals - with little support they have been responsible for the majority of bus conservation. Little progress has been made in prioritising this assortment, which is scattered all over the country, with some concentration in the cities.

The key needs for the bus and coach category are the completion of a category register of preserved buses as a prelude to
introducing a grading system; a strategy for accommodating at least the most important vehicles under cover (presently 50% of all preserved buses are stored in the open); the conservation of the most important vehicles; facilities for improved public access and education; an archive of papers, ephemera and small artefacts which might otherwise disappear.

===Railways===
[[File:Goathland station.jpg|thumb|[[Goathland railway station]] on the [[North Yorkshire Moors Railway]], showing preserved rolling stock, buildings and infrastructure.]]
With over 400 miles of track, nearly 600 stations and about 150 locations around the country, heritage railways and the items in museums represent a big investment. Amassing a combined annual turnover in excess of £30 million and around 9 million passengers a year, they form a prime element of the British leisure industry. Incredibly, over 1,000 steam engines survive, though less than 20% are operable at any one time due to the high cost of overhaul. In addition, over 700 diesel locomotives and about 150 passenger units are in preservation together with a regrettably small number of electric units. Over 3,000 passenger carriages and 2,500 freight vehicles are also held in various states of conservation. The [[Heritage Railway Association]] provides support and advice to heritage lines. The busiest heritage line in Britain is the [[North Yorkshire Moors Railway]], which operates over 100 days a year over the bulk of the 24 mile trackbed constructed by [[George Stephenson]] and which opened in 1836.

The key needs for the railways category are a grading system for vehicles and lines to focus funding on the most worthy; safe access for the public to workshops and sheds to increase visitor appeal; covered accommodation for both restoration work and carriage storage; a concerted effort to conserve electric trains; support for private enthusiast restoration projects to increase capacity; archive storage to minimise losses of priceless records.

===Maritime===
This diverse and scattered category is highly dependent on private individuals. Only canal and inland waterways craft have a degree of structure, largely because of their links with the waterways. Others such as fishing boats, lifeboats and traditional river craft are found all round the UK. In museums smaller vessels are typically overshadowed by larger ones. Steam has a strong following. Most boats are privately owned and the majority are sailable. There are probably about 500 small boats of major historical importance which should be preserved - their interests are managed by a plethora of ‘umbrella’ organisations, to which the [[National Maritime Museum]] is attempting to bring a degree of co-ordination. The [[National Small Boat Register]], managed by the [[National Maritime Museum Cornwall]], maintains listings of over 1,200 small craft (under 12m/40&amp;nbsp;ft) that embrace rarity, historic and cultural value. The [[Advisory Committee for National Historic Ships]] maintains a register of larger historic vessels [over 10.1m/33&amp;nbsp;ft] that have demonstrably strong UK associations.

The key needs for the maritime category are a common grading system across the category is needed in order to prioritise
conservation efforts; the preservation of the 500 small craft of significant heritage importance could be enhanced by relatively modest supporting sums; more training in traditional skills; safe storage where boats at risk could be placed pending restoration.

===General conclusions===
[[File:Calshot Red Plaque-1.JPG|thumb|right|Transport Heritage plaque on the former Sunderland flying boat hangar at [[RAF Calshot|Calshot]].]]
[[File:Hythe Pier Red Plaque-1.jpg|thumb|right|Transport Heritage plaque at [[Hythe Pier, Railway and Ferry|Hythe Pier and Railway]] the oldest working pier railway in the world.]] 
Despite the rich diversity of Britain's transport heritage, there are many common threads.  Strategic leadership and vision is vital and umbrella organisations can play a vital role. Undercover storage is also critical for artefacts that have long exceeded their envisaged working lives. And, finally, since transport is appreciated most when used, many irreplaceable historical relics are wearing out and should be replaced by working replicas.

=='Red Wheel heritage plaque' programme==

The Trust runs a scheme that creates and places Red Wheel transport heritage plaques on especially important and unusual sites of transport heritage.
The Trust is open to nominations for Red Wheel plaques at sites which would otherwise be ignored or their value under appreciated by members of the public.
To nominate a site the Trust has an online proposal process on their website &lt;ref&gt;http://www.transporttrust.com/nominate-red-wheel-site&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''treasure binding''', or '''jewelled bookbinding''' / '''jeweled bookbinding''' is a luxurious [[book cover]] using [[metalwork]] in gold or silver, jewels or [[ivory]], perhaps in addition to more usual [[bookbinding]] material for book-covers such as leather, velvet, or other cloth.  The actual bookbinding technique is the same as for other medieval books, with the folios, normally of [[vellum]], stitched together and bound to wooden cover boards.  The metal furnishings of the treasure binding are then fixed, normally by tacks, onto these boards.  Treasure bindings appear to have existed from at least [[Late Antiquity]], though there are no surviving examples from so early, and [[Early Medieval]] examples are very rare.  They were less used by the end of the Middle Ages, but a few continued to be produced in the West even up to the present day, and many more in areas where [[Eastern Orthodoxy]] predominated.  The bindings were mainly used on grand [[illuminated manuscript]]s, especially [[Gospel book]]s designed for the altar and use in church services, rather than study in the library.

The vast majority of these bookbindings were later destroyed as their valuable gold and jewels were removed by looters, or the owners when in need of cash.  Others survive without their jewels, and many are either no longer attached to a book, or have been moved to a different book.&lt;ref&gt;See for example the [[Lindau Gospels]]; as removing and attaching cover plates is relatively easy, moving them between books seems to have been common at all periods. In the last 200 years many art dealers have preferred to treat book and cover as different objects, and have separated them&lt;/ref&gt;  Some survive in major libraries - for example the [[Morgan Library]] in [[New York City]], the [[John Rylands Library]] in [[Manchester]], the [[British Library]] in [[London]] and the [[Bibliothèque Nationale]] in [[Paris]].  As the carved ivory reliefs often used could not usually be recycled, these survive in much larger numbers, giving a better idea of the numbers of treasure bindings that once existed.  Other examples are recorded in documentary sources but though the books survive the covers do not.  The [[Book of Kells]] lost its binding after a robbery, and the fate of the missing cover of the [[Book of Lindisfarne]] is not recorded.

In the Eastern Orthodox churches treasure bindings have continued to be produced, mainly for liturgical Gospel books, up to the present day, and exist in many different artistic styles. Other styles of binding using gems, and typically pearls, have a covering of [[velvet]] or other textile, to which the gems are sewn or otherwise fixed.  These were more likely to be for the private books of a grand person, especially the prayer books and [[books of hours]] of female royalty, and may also include [[embroidery]].

==Technique and Production==
The techniques for producing jewelled bookbinding have evolved over the course of history with the technologies and methods used in creating books. During the fourth century of the Christian era, manuscripts on [[papyrus]] or [[vellum]] scrolls first became flattened and turned into books with cut pages tied together through holes punched in their margins. Beginning in the fifth century, books were sewn together in this manner using leather thongs to make the bind stronger and longer lasting with wooden boards placed on top and bottom to keep the pages flat. These thongs then came to be laced into the boards and covered entirely by leather.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Johnson|first=Pauline|title=Creative Bookbinding|year=1990|publisher=Dover Publications|location=New York|pages=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Boards afforded the opportunity for decorative ornamentation, with metal casings set into the wood for the installation of precious gems, stones, and jewels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Johnson|first=Pauline|title=Creative Bookbinding|year=1990|publisher=Dover Publications|location=New York|pages=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cover material would then be laid over the casings by hand and cut around the rim of the casings to reveal the jewels. The books typically bound were Gospels and other religious books made for use within the church. In the Middle Ages, the responsibility of creating adorned books went to metalworkers and guilders, not the bookbinders, who worked with sheets of gold, silver, or copper to create jewelled and enamelled panels that were nailed separately into the wooden boards.&lt;ref name="Marks 1998 56"&gt;{{cite book|last=Marks|first=P.J.M.|title=The British Library Guide to Bookbinding: History and Techniques|year=1998|publisher=University of Toronto Press|location=Toronto|pages=56}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other Forms===
Metalwork [[book furniture]] also included metal clasps holding the book shut when not in use, and isolated metal elements decorating a leather or cloth cover, which were very common in grander libraries in the later Middle Ages.  Decorative book clasps or straps were made with jewels or [[repoussé]] metal from the 12th century onward, particularly in Holland and Germany.&lt;ref name="Foot"&gt;{{cite web|last=Foot|first=Miriam M.|title=Bookbinding|work=Oxford Art Online|accessdate=27 February 2012|author2=Robert C. Akers }}&lt;/ref&gt; In Scotland and Ireland from the ninth century or earlier, books that were regarded as [[relic]]s of monastic leaders were enshrined in a decorated metal [[reliquary]] box called a [[cumdach]], and thereafter were probably not used as books. These were even carried into battle as a kind of standard, worn around the neck by a soldier like a protective amulet. Jewelled slipcases or boxes were also used to house small editions of the [[Qur’an]] during this time period.&lt;ref name="Marks 1998 56"/&gt;

In fashion in the 16th century were 'books of golde': small, devotional books adorned with jewelled or enamelled covers worn as a girdle or around the neck like pieces of jewellery by the English court. These pieces can be seen in portraits from the period and records of jewels from the reigns of [[Henry VIII]] and [[Edward VI]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Foot|first=Miriam M.|title=Bookbinding 1400-1557|work=Cambridge Histories Online|publisher=Cambridge University Press|accessdate=28 February 2012|pages=123}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

Treasure bindings were a luxury affordable only by wealthy elites, and were commissioned by wealthy private collectors, churches and senior clergy and royalty, and were often commissioned for presentation by or to royal or noble persons.&lt;ref name="Foot"/&gt;  The earliest reference to them is in a letter of [[Saint Jerome]] of 384, where he "writes scornfully of the wealthy Christian women whose books are written in gold on [[purple vellum]], and clothed with gems...".&lt;ref name="Needham, 21"&gt;Needham, 21&lt;/ref&gt;  From at least the 6th century they are seen in mosaics and other images, such as the 6th century icon of [[Christ Pantocrator]] from [[Saint Catherine's Monastery]] and the famous mosaic of [[Justinian I]] in the [[Basilica of San Vitale]] in [[Ravenna]].  The ivory panels often placed in the centre of covers were adapted from the style of [[consular diptych]]s, and indeed a large proportion of surviving examples of those were reused on book covers in the Middle Ages.&lt;ref name="Needham, 21"/&gt;  Some bindings were created to contain [[relic]]s of saints, and these large books were sometimes seen suspended from golden rods and carried in the public processions of [[Byzantine emperor]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Diehl|first=Edith|title=Bookbinding: Its Background and Technique Vol. 1|year=1980|publisher=Dover Publications|location=New York|pages=19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Especially in the [[Celtic Christianity]] of Ireland and Britain, relatively ordinary books that had belonged to monastic saints became treated as relics, and might be rebound with a treasure binding, or placed in a [[cumdach]].

The gems and gold do not merely create an impression of richness, though that was certainly part of their purpose, but served both to offer a foretaste of the bejewelled nature of the [[Celestial city]] in religious contexts, and particular types of gem were believed to have actual powerful properties in various "scientific", medical and magical respects, as set out in the popular [[lapidary (text)|lapidary books]].&lt;ref&gt;Metz, 26-30&lt;/ref&gt;  Several liturgical books given rich bindings can be shown by textual analysis to lack essential parts of the normal textual apparatus of a "working" version of their text, like the [[Book of Kells]] and the [[Codex Aureus of Echternach]].  They may have been used for readings at services, but in a monastery were essentially part of the furnishings of the church rather than the library; as records from the [[Abbey of Kells]] show, the book of Kells lived in the [[sacristry]].

[[Byzantine]] and Western medieval treasure bindings are often not entirely unified in style. Apart from being completed at different times, and sometimes in different countries, elements were also removed and readapted for other volumes or reset with new pieces as time passed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Prideaux|first=Sarah Teverbian|title=An Historical Sketch of Bookbinding|year=1893|publisher=Lawrence and Bullen|location=London|pages=179|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1VlAAAAAYAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=An+Historical+Sketch+of+Bookbinding&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=WHZqT8r-CMbZgQeo7dGrBg&amp;ved=0CD0Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|author2=Edward Gordon Duff }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the covers now on the [[Lindau Gospels]] come from different parts of South Germany, with the lower or back cover created in the eighth century (earlier than the book they now adorn) while the upper or front cover was completed in the ninth century; both incorporate gilded metal ornamented with jewels.  It is not known when they were first used on this manuscript.&lt;ref&gt;Needham, 24-29&lt;/ref&gt;

Outside the monasteries, the emerging bookbinders’ guilds of the Middle Ages were often restricted by law with quantitative limitations on the application of jewels. Though this did not significantly affect the craft of decorating books, it did mandate the number of jewels allowed depending on the position or rank of the commissioner of the work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Diehl|first=Edith|title=Bookbinding: Its Background and Technique Vol. 1|year=1980|publisher=Dover Publications|location=New York|pages=52}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hardly any early medieval English treasure bindings survived the [[dissolution of the monasteries]] and the [[English Reformation]], when ecclesiastical libraries in England were rounded up and treasure bindings removed under an act to ‘to strip off and pay into the king’s treasury all gold and silver found on Popish books of devotion.’ Comparable depredations were not as thorough in the Continental [[Protestant Reformation]], but most bindings survive from Catholic areas that avoided later war and revolutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Prideaux|first=Sarah Teverbian|title=An Historical Sketch of Bookbinding|year=1893|publisher=Lawrence and Bullen|location=London|pages=2|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1VlAAAAAYAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=An+Historical+Sketch+of+Bookbinding&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=WHZqT8r-CMbZgQeo7dGrBg&amp;ved=0CD0Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|author2=Edward Gordon Duff }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the commoditisation of book production due to the printing press, the artistic tradition of jewelled bookbinding continued in England, though less frequently and often in simpler designs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Davenport|first=Cyril|title=Cantor Lectures on Decorative Bookbinding|year=1898|publisher=William Trounce|location=London|pages=8|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WrnPAAAAMAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=cantor+lectures+on+decorative+bookbinding&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=PXpqT60Wh-qCB6q9sLoG&amp;ved=0CE4Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; Luxury bindings were still favoured by the English Court, which is evident from the records on the private library of [[Queen Elizabeth I]], who favoured velvet bindings. On a visit to the Royal Library in 1598, [[Paul Hentzner]] remarked on the books ‘bound in velvet of different colours, though chiefly red, with clasps of gold and silver; some have pearls, and precious stones, set in their bindings.’&lt;ref name="Marks 1998 57"&gt;{{cite book|last=Marks|first=P.J.M.|title=The British Library Guide to Bookbinding: History and Techniques|year=1998|publisher=University of Toronto Press|location=Toronto|pages=57}}&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, the style evolved to be one using velvet, satin, silk, and canvas in bookbinding decorated less with jewels and more with embroidery, metal threads, pearls, and sequins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Marks|first=P.J.M.|title=The British Library Guide to Bookbinding: History and Techniques|year=1998|publisher=University of Toronto Press|location=Toronto|pages=59}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Revival===
{{external media | width = 210px | align = right
 | video1 = [http://smarthistory.khanacademy.org/lindau-gospels-cover.html Lindau Gospels Cover], [[Smarthistory]]&lt;ref name="smarth"&gt;{{cite web | title =Lindau Gospels Cover | work = | publisher =[[Smarthistory]] at [[Khan Academy]] | url =http://smarthistory.khanacademy.org/lindau-gospels-cover.html | accessdate =May 8, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; }}
After jewelled bookbinding enjoyed its renaissance, the practice waned until it experienced a revival near the turn of the twentieth century in England. Highly influential in the revival of this style were [[Francis Sangorski]] and George Sutcliffe of the [[Sangorski &amp; Sutcliffe]] bindery. Their bindings were not large uncut gems as in Mediaeval times, but semi-precious stones ''[[en cabochon]]'' set into beautifully designed bindings with multi-coloured leather inlays and elaborate gilt tooling. The craftsmanship of these bindings was unsurpassable; only their competitors [[Robert Riviere|Riviere]] produced work of similar quality. The most famous of these bindings is "[[The Great Omar]]" (1909) on a large copy of [[Edward FitzGerald (poet)|FitzGerald's]] ''[[Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam]]'', which included good tooling, inlays of coloured leather, and 1050 jewels in a peacock design scheme.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Middleton|first=Bernard|title=A History of English Craft Bookbinding Technique|year=1996|publisher=The British Library|location=London|pages=125–126|edition=4th}}&lt;/ref&gt; It went down with the ''[[RMS Titanic|Titanic]]'' in 1912. Today, a third reproduction of this binding is the only one to survive, after the second one, reproduced to Sutcliffe’s design by his nephew Stanley Bray, was damaged in the [[The Blitz|Blitz]] during [[World War II]]. Bray’s second attempt at recreating the design, the third version that survives, was placed in the [[British Library]] in 1989.&lt;ref name="Marks 1998 57"/&gt;

Other binderies creating books in this style during this period were the companies of Rivière and [[Zaehnsdorf]].  The largest collection of these masterpieces was the Phoebe Boyle one; over 100 jewelled bindings were sold in 1923. Jewelled bindings occasionally appear at auction; literature on them is surprisingly scant given their superb quality.

In 1998, Rob Shepherd of [http://www.bookbinding.co.uk/ Shepherds Bookbinders] bought both Zaehnsdorf and Sangorski &amp; Sutcliffe. Presently, binding with jewels is a rare practice, and binding companies both large and small are finding the art form becoming less viable in today’s society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Severs|first=John|title=A Model, Modern Artisan|journal=Printweek|date=27 March 2009|pages=22–23}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Bindings that exist today are housed in private collections or can be found in libraries and museums across the world.

'''Verulamium''' was a town in [[Roman Britain]]. It was sited in the southwest of the modern city of [[St Albans]] in [[Hertfordshire]], [[Great Britain]]. A large portion of the Roman city remains unexcavated, being now park and agricultural land, though much has been built upon.&lt;ref&gt;[http://pleiades.stoa.org/places/79739/boundary-of-settlement-walls-approx./ Boundary of settlement walls] , Pleiades&lt;/ref&gt; The ancient [[Watling Street]] passed through the city. Much of the site and its environs is now classed as a [[scheduled ancient monument]].&lt;ref&gt;{{NHLE|num=1003515 |desc=|accessdate=13 November 2013}} and related schedules.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Before the Romans established their settlement, there was already a tribal centre in the area which belonged to the [[Catuvellauni]]. This settlement is usually called [[Verlamion]]. The etymology is uncertain but the name has been [[linguistic reconstruction|reconstructed]] as *''Uerulāmion'', which would have a meaning like "[the tribe or settlement] of the broad hand" (''Uerulāmos'') in [[Common Brittonic|Brittonic]].&lt;ref name="Isaac"&gt;Isaac, Graham R. "Place-Names in Ptolemy's Geography: An Electronic Data Base with Etymological Analysis of the Celtic Name-elements". Aberystwyth : CMCS Publications, 2004. Computer file : CD-ROM.&lt;/ref&gt; In this pre-Roman form, it was among the first places in [[Great Britain|Britain]] recorded by name. The settlement was established by [[Tasciovanus]], who minted coins there.

The Roman settlement was granted the rank of ''[[municipium]]'' around AD&amp;nbsp;50, meaning its citizens had what were known as "Latin Rights", a lesser citizenship status than a ''[[Colonia (Roman)|colonia]]'' possessed. It grew to a significant town, and as such received the attentions of [[Boudica]] of the [[Iceni]] in 61, when Verulamium was sacked and burnt on her orders: a black ash layer has been recorded by archaeologists, thus confirming the Roman written record. It grew steadily; by the early 3rd century, it covered an area of about {{convert|125|acre|km2}}, behind a deep ditch and wall. It is the location of the martyrdom of the first British martyr saint, [[Saint Alban]], who was a Roman patrician converted by the priest [[Amphibalus]].&lt;ref&gt;This story is recorded by [[Bede]] and also by the monks of the abbey of the town, notably Brother [[Matthew Paris]] in his Anglo-Norman ''Vie de Seint Auban''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Verulamium contained a [[forum (Roman)|forum]], [[basilica]] and a [[Roman theatre (structure)|theatre]], much of which were damaged during two fires, one in 155 and the other in around 250. One of the few extant Roman inscriptions in Britain is found on the remnants of the forum (see [[Verulamium Forum inscription]]). The town was rebuilt in [[Rock (geology)|stone]] rather than [[timber]] at least twice over the next 150 years. Occupation by the Romans ended between 400 and 450.

There are a few remains of the Roman city visible, such as parts of the [[city walls]], a [[hypocaust]] still [[in situ]] under a mosaic floor, and the theatre, as well as items in the Museum (below). More remains under the nearby agricultural land which have never been excavated were for a while seriously threatened by deep [[ploughing]].

Verulamium is mentioned in a Latin inscription on a [[Wax tablet]], dated to AD 62, discovered in London during the Bloomberg excavations, 2010-14:&lt;ref&gt;Tomlin, R.S.O., Roman London's first voices. Writing tablets from the Bloomberg excavations, 2010-14, London 2016, writing tablet 45.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Roman Theatre===
{{Main|Roman Theatre, St Albans}}
[[File:RomanTheatreVerulamium-PS1.jpg|thumb|right| alt=Roman theatre packed-earth entryway and central stage surrounded by grass-covered seating hillocks (ruins)|Roman theatre]]
Although there are other Roman theatres in Britain (for example at [[Camulodunum]]), the one at Verulamium has been claimed to be the only example of its kind, being a theatre with a stage rather than an [[amphitheatre]].&lt;ref name="GE"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.gorhamburyestate.co.uk/The-Roman-Theatre |title=The Roman Theatre |website=www.gorhamburyestate.co.uk |access-date=2017-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sub-Roman times===
[[St Albans Cathedral|St Albans Abbey]] and the associated [[Anglo-Saxon settlement of Britain|Anglo-Saxon]] settlement were founded on a hill outside the Roman city. The site of the abbey may have been a location where there was reason to believe that [[St Alban]] was executed or buried. More certainly, the abbey is near the site of a Roman cemetery, which, as was normal in Roman times, was outside the city walls. It is unknown whether there are Roman remains under the medieval abbey. An archaeological excavation in 1978, directed by [[Martin Biddle]], failed to find Roman remains on the site of the medieval [[chapter house]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.stalbanscathedral.org/history/chapter-house/history |title=Chapter House History - The Cathedral and Abbey Church of Saint Alban |publisher=Stalbanscathedral.org |date= |accessdate=2013-11-13 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131113154308/http://www.stalbanscathedral.org/history/chapter-house/history |archive-date=13 November 2013 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[David Nash Ford]] identifies the community as the {{nowrap|''Cair Mincip''}}&lt;ref&gt;[[Nennius]] ({{abbr|attrib.|Traditional attribution}}). [[Theodor Mommsen]] ({{abbr|ed.|Editor}}). [[s:la:Historia Brittonum#VI. CIVITATES BRITANNIAE|''Historia Brittonum'', VI.]] Composed after {{sc|ad}}&amp;nbsp;830. {{la icon}} Hosted at [[s:la:Main Page|Latin Wikisource]].&lt;/ref&gt; ("[[Caer|Fort]] [[Municipium]]") listed by [[Nennius]] among the 28 cities of [[Sub-Roman Britain|Britain]] in his ''[[Historia Brittonum|History of the Britains]]''.&lt;ref name=nashford&gt;Ford, David Nash. "[http://www.britannia.com/history/ebk/articles/nenniuscities.html The 28 Cities of Britain]" at Britannia. 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; As late as the eighth century the Saxon inhabitants of St Albans nearby were aware of their ancient neighbour, which they knew alternatively as ''Verulamacæstir'' or, under what [[H. R. Loyn]] terms "their own hybrid", ''Vaeclingscæstir'', "the fortress of the followers of Wæcla", possibly a pocket of British-speakers remaining separate in an increasingly Saxonised area.&lt;ref&gt;Loyn, ''Anglo-Saxon England and the Norman Conquest'', 2nd ed. 1991:11.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Loss and recovery==
The city was quarried for building material for the construction of medieval St Albans; indeed, much of the [[St Albans Abbey|Norman abbey]] was constructed from the remains of the Roman city, with Roman brick and stone visible. The modern city takes its name from [[Saint Alban|Alban]], either a citizen of ''Verulamium'' or a [[Roman army|Roman soldier]], who was condemned to death in the 3rd century for sheltering [[Amphibalus]], a [[Christian]]. Alban was converted by him to Christianity, and by virtue of his death, Alban became the first British Christian [[martyr]].

Since much of the modern city and its environs is built over Roman remains, it is still common to unearth Roman artefacts several miles away. A complete tile [[kiln]] was found in [[Park Street, Hertfordshire|Park Street]] some six miles (10&amp;nbsp;km) from Verulamium in the 1970s, and there is a Roman mausoleum near [[Rothamsted Park]] five miles (8&amp;nbsp;km) away.

Within the walls of ancient ''Verulamium'', the [[Elizabethan era|Elizabethan]] philosopher, essayist and statesman [[Sir Francis Bacon]] built a "refined small house" that was thoroughly described by the 17th century diarist [[John Aubrey]]. No trace of it is left, but Aubrey noted, "At Verulam is to be seen, in some few places, some remains of the wall of this Citie".

Moreover, when Bacon was ennobled in 1618, he took the title [[Baron Verulam]] after ''Verulamium''. The barony became extinct after he died without heirs in 1626.

This title was revived in 1790 for [[James Grimston, 1st Earl of Verulam|James Grimston]], a Hertfordshire politician. He was later made [[Earl of Verulam]], a title still held by his descendants.

==Verulamium Museum==
[[File:Verulamium-Museum-20031112-011.jpg|thumb|The Verulamium Museum in 2003]]
The Verulamium Museum is run by the [[St Albans City Council|district council]] in [[Verulamium Park]] (adjacent to [[St. Michael's Church, St. Albans|St Michael's Church]]), which contains much information about the town, both as a [[Roman Empire|Roman]] and [[Iron Age]] settlement, plus Roman history in general.
The museum was established following the excavations carried out by [[Mortimer Wheeler]] and his wife, [[Tessa Wheeler]], during the 1930s.

Between September 1996 and May 1997, the museum was extended. During the building work, an excavation of the site took place.&lt;ref name="vm"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.stalbansmuseums.org.uk/collection/verulamium-museum-excavation/ |title=Museum excavation |website=www.stalbansmuseums.org.uk |access-date=2017-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
It has won an architectural award for its domed entrance (designed by [[Peter Melvin]]).{{fact|date=December 2018}}

===Collections===
It is noted for the large and colourful mosaics and many other artefacts, such as [[pottery]], jewellery, tools and [[coin]]s, from the Roman period. Many were found in formal excavations, but some, particularly a [[coffin]] still containing a male skeleton, were unearthed nearby during building work.

==Other==
The [[asteroid]] [[4206 Verulamium]] was named in honour of the ancient city.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12744">'''Wesley Newcomb Hohfeld''' (9 August 1879, [[Oakland, California]]{{spaced ndash}}21 October 1918, [[Alameda, California]])&lt;ref&gt;The [[Yale Law Journal]]. Vol. 28, No. 2, Dec., 1918, page 167: [https://www.jstor.org/stable/786851?seq=2 "Wesley Newcomb Hohfeld"].&lt;/ref&gt; was an American [[jurist]]. He was the author of the seminal ''Fundamental Legal Conceptions as Applied in Judicial Reasoning and Other Legal Essays'' (1919).

During his life he published only a handful of law journal articles. After his death the material forming the basis of ''Fundamental Legal Conceptions'' was derived from two articles in the ''[[Yale Law Journal]]'' (1913) and (1917) that had been partially revised with a view to publication. Editorial work was undertaken to complete the revisions and the book was published with the inclusion of the manuscript notes that Hohfeld had left, plus seven other essays.

The work remains a powerful contribution to modern understanding of the nature of [[rights]] and the implications of [[liberty]]. To reflect Hohfeld's continuing importance, a chair at [[Yale University]] is named after him.  The chair is unoccupied as of 2016 but was last held by [[Jules Coleman]], who retired in 2012.

==Career==
Wesley Newcomb Hohfeld was born in California in 1879.  He graduated from the [[University of California, Berkeley]] in 1901.  He went on to [[Harvard Law School]], where he served as editor of the ''[[Harvard Law Review]]'', and graduated in 1904 with honors.

From 1905 to 1913 Hohfeld taught at [[Stanford Law School]].  He then moved to [[Yale Law School]], where he taught until his death in 1918.&lt;ref&gt;Dictionary of American Biography 5:124 (Charles Scribner's Sons, New York 1933); Guide to American Law 6:58 (St. Paul, West Publishing 1984); ''see also'' Hohfeld's obituary, "Wesley Newcomb Hohfeld", 28 Yale Law Journal 166 (1918) and Walter W. Cook, "Hohfeld's Contributions to the Science of Law", 28 Yale Law Journal 721 (1918).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hohfeld as professor of jurisprudence==
[[Jurisprudence]] is the branch of [[philosophy]] which deals with principles of law and the legal systems through which the law is applied. Hohfeld's contribution was to simplify; he created a very precise analysis which distinguished between fundamental legal concepts and then identified the framework of relationships between them. His work offers a sophisticated method for deconstructing broad legal principles into their component elements.  By showing how legal relationships are connected to each other, the resulting analysis illuminates policy implications and identifies the issues which arise in practical decision making.&lt;ref&gt;Luca Fiorito and Massimiliano Vatiero (2011), "Beyond Legal Relations: Wesley Newcomb Hohfeld's Influence on American Institutionalism". Journal of Economics Issues, 45 (1): 199-222.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hohfeldian analysis==
===Overview===
Hohfeld noticed that even respected jurists conflate various meanings of the term ''right'', sometimes switching senses of the word several times in a single sentence. He wrote that such imprecision of language indicated a concomitant imprecision of thought, and thus also of the resulting legal conclusions. In order to both facilitate reasoning and clarify rulings, he attempted to disambiguate the term ''rights'' by breaking it into eight distinct concepts. To eliminate ambiguity, he defined these terms relative to one another, grouping them into four pairs of Jural Opposites and four pairs of Jural Correlatives.

This use of the words ''right'' and ''privilege'' correspond respectively to the concepts of [[claim rights and liberty rights]].

Hohfeld argued that right and duty are correlative concepts, i.e. the one must always be matched by a claim about the other. If A has a right against B, this is equivalent to B having a duty to honor A's right. If B has no duty, that means that B has a privilege, i.e. B can do whatever he or she pleases because B has no duty to refrain from doing it. Each individual is located within a matrix of relationships with other individuals. By summing the rights held and duties owed across all these relationships, the analyst can identify both the degree of liberty — A would have perfect liberty if A has no duty to refrain from acting and others have a duty never to interfere with A's actions — and whether the concept of liberty is comprised by commonly followed practices, thereby establishing general moral principles and [[civil rights]].

===Examples of Hohfeldian analysis===
Hohfeld defines the correlatives in terms of the relationships between two individuals. In the theory of "[[in rem]] rights", there is a direct relationship between a person and a thing. Real rights are in this respect unlike claim rights or "rights in personam", which by nature must be exercised against a person, the best example being when someone is owed money by another. Hohfeld demonstrates that this way of understanding rights in general is wrong. In particular, Hohfeld demonstrates that there is no such thing as a legal relation between a person and a thing, since a legal relation always operates between two people. As the legal relations between any two people are complex, it is helpful to break them down into their simplest forms. Legal rights do not correspond to single Hohfeldian relations, but are compounds of them. A right can be defined as an aggregate of the Hohfeldian relations with other people.

Hohfeld replaces the concept of "right in personam" by "paucital right" and "right in rem" by a compound or aggregate of "multital rights". Rights held by a person against one or a few definite persons are paucital (or "in personam"), and rights held by a person against a large indefinite class of people are multital (or "in rem"). A contract right is paucital (or "in personam") because it can be enforced only against the specific parties to the contract. A property right is multital (or "in rem") because a landowner has the right to exclude not only specific people from his land but the "whole world". The landowner has many rights, privileges, powers, and immunities; his multital rights are composed of many paucital rights. For example, the owner has a right that others do not step on his land but there is not just one such right against a mass of persons (the community), but many separate although usually identical paucital rights with this content (as many instances as there are people in the community). This is what Hohfeld calls "multital" rights.

Consider also the definition of liberty. In Hohfeldian analysis, liberty is defined by an absence both of a duty and of a right. B is free because he has no duty to refrain from acting and because A has no right that he not act. That does not deny that B might decide to do what A wants because that is the essence of liberty. Nor does it deny the possibility that B might accept a duty to A to give a benefit to C. In that situation, C would have no right and would have to rely on A to enforce the duty. The truth is that liberty is significant from both a legal and a moral point of view because only liberty ensures that an individual has control over his or her choices on whether and how to act. If something interferes with this choice, the natural reaction is to resent it and to seek a remedy. The correlative between right and duty inevitably describes the way in which two people are limited in their choices to act, and the outside observer cannot capture the legal and moral implications without examining the nature of the right held by A. Hence, this relationship is qualitatively different. An interference with liberty would be considered wrongful without having to ask for detailed evidence. Yet whether A's relationship with B is morally suspect could only be determined by evaluating evidence on precisely what B's duty requires B to do or not to do.

'''''What We Lose''''' is the debut novel of American author [[Zinzi Clemmons]]. It was loosely based on her own experiences caring for her mother who was dying of cancer. 

==Background==
{{Expand section|date=May 2018}}

Clemmons was a graduate student in the fiction MFA program at [[Columbia University]], working on a novel, when her mother was diagnosed with [[breast cancer]]. She finished her degree but set aside the novel, instead writing journals of her experiences caring for and ultimately grieving her mother's death. These became the basis of a more experimental project than her unfinished linear novel, a fragmentary and chronologically disrupted "exercise in autofiction".&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

==Plot==
Thandi, the daughter of an [[South Africa]] mother and an American father, comes of age in [[Pennsylvania]]. When she is in college, her mother is stricken by cancer and dies, causing Thandi's life to fall apart as she struggles to process her grief.

Shortly thereafter, Thandi discovers she is pregnant by her boyfriend Peter. She decides to carry the pregnancy to term and has a son she names Mahpee. She and Peter quickly marry and he moves to New York City to be with her and their child. However their marriage quickly falls apart and after she cheats on him, she decides to ask for a separation. 

Thandi begins to forget her mother and slowly begins to heal, though she realizes her mother's death will haunt her for the rest of her life.

==Style==
In ''[[The Guardian]]'', Marta Bausells described ''What We Lose'' as "highly experimental, told in intimate vignettes including blogposts, photos, hand-drawn charts and hip-hop lyrics".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/aug/10/zinzi-clemmons-what-we-lose-interview|title=Zinzi Clemmons on her first novel: 'I’m proud of it, because I didn’t hold anything back'|last1=Bausells|first1=Marta|date=August 10, 2017|work=The Guardian|accessdate=January 13, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[Vogue (magazine)|Vogue]]'', Megan O'Grady notes the book's "boldly innovative and frankly sexual" style, noting "the collage-like novel mixes hand-drawn charts, archival photographs, rap lyrics, sharp disquisitions on the [[Nelson Mandela|Mandelas]] and [[Oscar Pistorius]], and singular meditations on racism’s brutal intimacies."&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.vogue.com/article/zinzi-clemmons-what-we-lose-interview|title=Zinzi Clemmons Has Written the Debut Novel of the Year|last=O'Grady|first=Megan|date=July 20, 2017|work=Vogue|access-date=2018-05-09|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; O'Grady compared Clemmons to authors like [[Karl Ove Knausgård|Karl Ove Knausgaard]], [[Meghan O'Rourke|Meghan O’Rourke]], and [[Claudia Rankine]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; 

Clemmons cites [[Toni Morrison]]'s ''[[The Bluest Eye]]'' as a significant influence for ''What We Lose''.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;
