The following is an overview of the events of '''2011 in film''', including the highest-grossing films, film festivals, award ceremonies and a list of films released and notable deaths.

More film [[sequel]]s were released in 2011 than any other year before it, with 28 sequels released.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://boxofficemojo.com/news/?id=3063|title=2011 Preview: Sequels - Now, More Than Ever|work=[[Box Office Mojo]]|accessdate=April 20, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Film critic Scout Tafoya considers 2011 as the best year for cinema, countering the notion of [[1939 in film|1939]] being film's best year overall and citing important developments in cinematic expression during 2011.

==Evaluation of the year==
[[Richard Brody]] of ''[[The New Yorker]]'' observed that the best films of 2011 "exalt the metaphysical, the fantastical, the transformative, the fourth-wall-breaking, or simply the impossible, and—remarkably—do so .... These films depart from 'reality' ... not in order to forget the irrefutable but in order to face it, to think about it, to act on it more freely".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Adams|first1=Ryan|title=Richard Brody names "The 26 Best Films of 2011"|url=http://www.awardsdaily.com/2011/12/07/richard-brody-names-the-26-best-films-of-2011/|website=[[Sasha Stone|Awards Daily]]|publisher=Sasha Stone|accessdate=18 September 2016|date=7 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Film critic and filmmaker Scout Tafoya of ''[[RogerEbert.com]]'' considers the year of 2011 as the best year for cinema, countering the notion of [[1939 in film|1939]] being film's best year overall, citing examples such as ''[[Drive (2011 film)|Drive]]'', ''[[The Tree of Life (film)|The Tree of Life]]'', ''[[Once Upon a Time in Anatolia]]'', ''[[Keyhole (film)|Keyhole]]'', ''[[Contagion (film)|Contagion]]'', ''[[The Adventures of Tintin (film)|The Adventures of Tintin]]'', and ''[[Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows]]''. He stated that "2011 housed not just some of the greatest art films of our age, but a revolution in the language of blockbuster filmmaking. One big-budget action film after another used digital cameras to show the world behind explosions in starker, stranger light, while constructing a backbone of classical ideas and images."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Tafoya|first1=Scout|title=The Unloved, Part 24: "Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows"|url=http://www.rogerebert.com/mzs/the-unloved-part-24-sherlock-holmes-a-game-of-shadows|website=RogerEbert.com|publisher=Ebert Digital LLC|accessdate=18 September 2016|date=1 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{refimprovesect|date=March 2016}}
The company was founded by Greg MacKellan and Stephanie Rhoads in 1993.&lt;ref name=highbeam&gt;[http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P3-114467819.html "Unearthing rare musical gems (summary of article)"] ''Stage Directions'', December 1, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;  It has presented the American premiere of musical scores by Jerome Kern (''Three Sisters'' and ''The Cabaret Girl'') and Johnny Mercer (''The Good Companions''). 42nd Street Moon also produced the first American revivals of Rodgers &amp; Hart’s 1926 musical ''[[Peggy-Ann]]'' and André Previn's ''[[Coco (musical)|Coco]]''.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}  For its first 15 seasons, the company presented its productions as staged concerts.&lt;ref&gt;Chavez, Adele. [http://www.sfbaytimes.com/article_p.php?article_id=7867 "''Student Gypsy'' – A Charming Find"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121016063656/http://www.sfbaytimes.com/article_p.php?article_id=7867 |date=2012-10-16 }}.  Sfbaytimes.com, April 3, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2008, it began to produce "fully staged" musicals, with costumes and choreography.&lt;ref&gt;[http://42ndstmoon.org/history "History"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110726043815/http://www.42ndstmoon.org/history |date=2011-07-26 }} 42ndstmoon.org, accessed August 8, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the production of ''Strike Up the Band'' in 2011 had choreography by Alex Hsu and costumes reviewed as "to-die-for 1920s attire" by Scarlett Kellum.&lt;ref&gt;Katz, Leslie. [http://www.sfexaminer.com/entertainment/theater/2011/04/all-s-fair-war-and-cheese-strike-band "All’s fair in war and cheese in ''Strike Up the Band''"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120617071827/http://www.sfexaminer.com/entertainment/theater/2011/04/all-s-fair-war-and-cheese-strike-band |date=2012-06-17 }}. ''San Francisco Examiner'', April 13, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

Two of 42nd Street Moon's productions have been recorded as [[Cast album]]s: Cole Porter's ''[[Something for the Boys]]'' and ''[[Leave It to Me!|Leave it to Me]]''. Both represent the first full English language records for either of these two musicals, with ''Leave It to Me'' being sponsored in part by the [[National Endowment for the Arts]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}  Videos of most of 42nd Street Moon's productions are available for viewing at the [[Museum of Performance &amp; Design]] in San Francisco.{{cn|date=March 2016}}

[[Artistic Director]] MacKellan has led developed several musical salons, each dedicated to exploring and celebrating the work of some of Broadway's greatest songwriters.  In 2013, ''[[Once In Love With Loesser]]'' was performed, in celebration of [[Frank Loesser]] and built around the three stages of his career: as a [[Tin Pan Alley]] lyricist, then working in Hollywood, and finally as a Broadway songwriter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url = http://www.huffingtonpost.com.au/entry/some-like-it-shot_b_3498021|title = Some Like It Shot|date = 26 June 2013|accessdate = 30 September 2016|first = George|last = Heymont|newspaper = [[Huffington Post]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
A young, hardworking Iranian man named Arash lives with and takes care of his heroin-addicted father, Hossein. They are harassed by a cruel, drug-dealer pimp named Saeed, who seizes the young man's prized car in exchange for money the father owes him. In a crime of opportunity, Arash steals a pair of diamond earrings from the wealthy young woman he works for, Shaydah.

Saeed comes across a strange young woman in a [[chador]] at night. She seduces Saeed to take him back to his apartment. While there, she grows long fangs and first bites off his finger, then goes for his neck, killing him. As she leaves, she passes by Arash, who has come to offer the earrings for his car. He finds Saeed dead, and takes back his car keys along with a suitcase of drugs and cash. Arash decides to sell the drugs, allowing him to quit his job working for Shaydah. Later, he goes to a costume party at a night club dressed up as Dracula, where he is seduced by Shaydah into taking one of the [[MDMA|ecstasy]] pills he is selling. Under the influence, he is rejected by her, and ends up lost at night on the street.

The woman with the chador spends her time listening to music alone in her apartment, skateboarding, or bedeviling pedestrians at night, until she comes across the lost Arash. He shows vulnerability and compassion, and she takes him to her home, where they listen to music, and she resists his exposed neck. They meet the next night, and she says that he does not know the terrible things she has done. He is unfazed, gives her the earrings and – at her request – pierces her ears with a safety pin, but she eventually leaves.

Atti, a prostitute who worked for Saeed, is followed at night by the woman, and they retreat to the prostitute's apartment. The woman gives Atti the payment Saeed owed her. They have a conversation during which the woman realizes that Atti no longer remembers what it is to desire. She leaves.

Suffering from [[heroin withdrawal]], Hossein has an episode where he believes that Arash's cat is his dead wife. Infuriated by his father, Arash gives him drugs and money and throws him out, telling him to take the cat with him. Hossein goes to Atti and forces her to take heroin with him. They are found by the woman, who kills Hossein. After Atti helps her dispose of Hossein's body, she tells her to take the cat and leave.

The following morning, Arash discovers Hossein's body. Distressed, he runs to the apartment of the woman and begs her to run away with him. As she is gathering up her things, the cat appears and Arash realizes that she had something to do with his father's death. Arash and the woman drive off together but he pulls off to the side of the road, angry and undecided about what to do. He eventually gets back in the car and the two continue their trip onwards.

'''Alexandre-Gabriel Decamps''' (March 3, 1803{{snd}}August 22, 1860) was a French painter noted for his Orientalist works.

==Life==
Decamps was born in Paris. In his youth he travelled in the East, and reproduced Oriental life and scenery with a bold fidelity to nature that puzzled conventional critics. His powers, however, soon came to be recognized, and he was ranked along with [[Eugène Delacroix|Delacroix]] and [[Ingres]] as one of the leaders of the French school. At the [[Exposition Universelle (1855)|Paris Exhibition of 1855]] he received the grand or council medal. Most of his life was passed in the neighborhood of Paris. He was fond of animals, especially dogs, and indulged in all kinds of field sports.&lt;ref name="EB1911"&gt;{{EB1911|inline=1|wstitle=Decamps, Alexandre Gabriel |volume=7 |page=909}} Endnote:
*[[Adolphe Moreau]], ''Decamps et son oeuvre'' (Paris, 1869)&lt;/ref&gt;

He died in 1860 in consequence of being thrown from a horse while hunting at [[Fontainebleau]].

==Founding father of Orientalism==
Decamps was the founding father of Orientalism since he revealed everyday Oriental life in the 1831 Salon in Paris. His subjects and style with strong contrast of light and thick material became the reference for painters but also photographers and writers.
He was the most influential painter on Orientalism and was proclaimed the chief of the new Orientalist School.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Garnier|first1=Nicole|title=Delacroix et l'aube de l'orientalisme, de Decamps à Fromentin|date=2012|publisher=Somogy Editions d'art - Domaine de Chantilly|location=Paris|isbn=978-2-7572-0609-6|page=40}}&lt;/ref&gt; Delacroix referred to him in the ''Women of Algiers'' (1834),  and the ''Fanatics of Tangiers'' (1838). Théophile Gautier’s ''Constantinople'' (1853) was described as an “immense verbal Decamps” by Henry James.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=James|first1=Henry|title=French Poets and Novelists|date=1878|publisher=Macmillan and Co|location=London|page=54}}&lt;/ref&gt; Maxime Du Camp named him the Christopher Columbus of the Orient&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Du Camp|first1=Maxime|title=Les Beaux-Arts à l'Exposition universelle de 1855|date=1855|publisher=Librairie nouvelle|location=Paris|page=150}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Théophile Gautier compared his role as the discoverer of the Orient to the role of Jean-Jacques Rousseau as the discoverer of nature in the eighteenth century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gautier|first1=Théophile|title=Les Beaux-Arts en Europe|date=1855|publisher=Michel Lévy frères|location=Paris |page=193 of 217}}&lt;/ref&gt; Christine Peltre concludes that the only equivalent to his fame were the ''Arabian Nights'' (''One Thousand and One Nights'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Peltre |first1=Christine |title=L'Atelier du voyage |date=1995 |publisher=Le Promeneur |location=Paris |page=89; 90}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Works==
Decamps' style was characteristically and intensely French. It was marked by vivid dramatic conception, bold and even rough brushstrokes, and startling contrasts of color and of light and shade. His subjects embraced an unusually wide range. He availed himself of his travels in the East in dealing with scenes from [[Biblical canon|Scripture history]], which he was probably the first of European painters to represent with their true and natural local background. Of this class were his ''Joseph sold by his Brethren'', ''Moses taken from the Nile'', and his scenes from the life of [[Samson]], nine vigorous sketches in charcoal and white.
[[File:La pattuglia turca.jpg|left|thumb|A version of ''The Turkish Patrol'' (1831)]]
Perhaps the most impressive of his historical pictures is ''Defeat of the Cimbri'', representing the conflict between a horde of barbarians and a disciplined army. Decamps produced a number of genre pictures, chiefly scenes from French and Turkish domestic life, the most marked feature of which is humour. The same characteristic attaches to many of his numerous animal paintings; Decamps was especially fond of painting monkeys. His well-known painting ''The Monkey Connoisseurs'' satirizes the jury of the [[French Academy of Painting]], which had rejected several of his earlier works on account of their divergence from any known standard.

His paintings and drawings were first made familiar to the English public through the lithographs of [[Eugene le Rouit]].

'''''An Area of Darkness''''' is a book written by [[V. S. Naipaul]] in 1964. It is a [[Travel literature|travelogue]] detailing Naipaul's trip through India in the early sixties. It was the first of Naipaul's acclaimed Indian trilogy which includes ''[[India: A Wounded Civilization]]'' and ''[[India: A Million Mutinies Now]]''.  The narration is anecdotal and descriptive.

A deeply pessimistic work, ''An Area of Darkness'' conveys the acute sense of disillusionment which the author experiences on his first visit to his ancestral land. The book was immediately banned in India for its "negative portrayal of India and its people".&lt;ref name="Hindu"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.thehindu.com/books/you-cant-read-this-book/article2953626.ece | title=You can't read this book | work=[[The Hindu]] | accessdate=5 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Art Nouveau''' ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|ɑː|r|t|_|n|uː|ˈ|v|oʊ|,_|ˌ|ɑː|r}}; {{IPA-fr|aʁ nuvo|lang}})  is an international [[style (visual arts)|style]] of art, architecture and [[applied art]], especially the [[decorative arts]], that was most popular between 1890 and 1910.&lt;ref&gt;Sterner (1982), 6.&lt;/ref&gt;  A reaction to the [[academic art]] of the 19th century, it was inspired by natural forms and structures, particularly the curved lines of plants and flowers.

English uses the French name Art Nouveau (new art).  The style is related to, but not identical with,  styles that emerged in many countries in Europe at about the same time:  in Austria it is known as ''[[Vienna Secession|Secessionsstil]]'' after ''[[Wiener Secession]]''; in Spanish ''Modernismo''; in Catalan ''[[Modernisme]]''; in Czech ''Secese''; in Danish ''Skønvirke'' or ''Jugendstil''; in German ''Jugendstil'', Art Nouveau or ''Reformstil''; in Hungarian ''Szecesszió''; in Italian Art Nouveau, ''Stile Liberty'' or  ''Stile floreale''; in Lithuanian ''Modernas''; in Norwegian ''Jugendstil''; in Polish ''Secesja''; in Slovak ''Secesia''; in Ukrainian and Russian ''Модерн'' (Modern)&lt;!--''Ар-нуво'' [Ar-nuvo] or ''Югендстиль'' [JUgendstil']--&gt;; in Swedish and Finnish ''Jugend''.

Art Nouveau is a [[gesamtkunstwerk|total art style]]: It embraces a wide range of fine and decorative arts, including architecture, painting, graphic art, interior design, jewelry, [[Art Nouveau furniture|furniture]], textiles, ceramics, glass art, and metal work. 

By 1910, Art Nouveau was already out of style. It was replaced as the dominant European architectural and decorative style first by [[Art Deco]] and then by [[Modernism]].&lt;ref&gt;Henry R. Hope, review of H. Lenning, ''The Art Nouveau'', ''The Art Bulletin'', vol. 34 (June 1952), 168–171 (esp. 168–169): Discussing the state of Art Nouveau during 1952, the author notes that Art Nouveau, which had become disfavored, was not yet an acceptable study for serious art history or a subject suitable for major museum exhibitions and their respective catalogs. He predicts an impending change, however.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="grove"&gt;Michèle Lavallée, "Art Nouveau", ''[[Grove Dictionary of Art]]'', [[Oxford University Press]] [accessed 11 April 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Naming==
Art Nouveau took its name from the ''Maison de l'Art Nouveau'' (''House of the New Art''), an art gallery opened in 1895 by the Franco-German [[art dealer]] [[Siegfried Bing]] that featured the new style. In France, Art Nouveau was also sometimes called by the British term "Modern Style" due to its roots in the [[Arts and Crafts movement]], ''Style moderne'', or ''Style 1900.''&lt;ref name="duncan23" /&gt; It was also sometimes called ''Style Jules Verne'', ''Le Style Métro'' (after Hector Guimard's iron and glass subway entrances), ''Art Belle Époque'', and ''Art fin de siècle''.&lt;ref name="Gontar, Cybele 2006" /&gt;

In Belgium, where the architectural movement began, it was sometimes termed ''Style nouille'' (noodle style) or ''Style coup de fouet'' (whiplash style).&lt;ref name="Gontar, Cybele 2006" /&gt;

In Britain, it was known as the ''Modern Style'', or, because of the Arts and Crafts movement led by [[Charles Rennie Mackintosh]] in Glasgow,  as the [[Glasgow School|"Glasgow" style]].

In Italy, because of the popularity of designs from London's [[Liberty (department store)|Liberty &amp; Co]] department store (mostly designed by [[Archibald Knox (designer)|Archibald Knox]]), it was sometimes called the ''Stile Liberty'' ("Liberty style"),  ''Stile floral'', or ''Arte nova'' (New Art).

In the United States, due to its association with [[Louis Comfort Tiffany]], it was often called the "Tiffany style".&lt;ref name="grove" /&gt;&lt;ref name="grove" /&gt;&lt;ref name="duncan23" /&gt;&lt;ref name="duncan23"&gt;Duncan (1994): 23–24.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Germany and Scandinavia, a related style emerged at about the same time; it was called ''Jugendstil'', after the popular German art magazine of that name.&lt;ref name="Gontar, Cybele 2006" /&gt;  In Austria and the neighboring countries then part of the [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]], a similar style emerged, called ''Secessionsstil'' in German, ({{lang-hu|szecesszió}}, {{lang-cs|secese}}) or ''Wiener Jugendstil'', after the artists of the [[Vienna Secession]].

The style was called ''Modern'' (Модерн) in Russia and ''Nieuwe Kunst'' (new art) in the Netherlands.&lt;ref name="grove" /&gt;&lt;ref name="duncan23" /&gt; In Spain the related style was known as ''Modernismo'', ''Modernisme'' (in Catalan), ''Arte joven'' ("young art"); and in Portugal ''Arte nova'' (new art). 

Some names refer specifically to the organic forms that were popular with the Art Nouveau artists: ''Stile Floreal'' ("floral style") in France; ''Paling Stijl'' ("eel style") in the Netherlands;  and ''Wellenstil'' ("wave style") and ''Lilienstil'' ("lily style") in Germany.&lt;ref name="duncan23" /&gt;

==History==

===Origins===

&lt;/gallery&gt;
The new art movement had its roots in Britain, in the floral designs of [[William Morris]], and in the [[Arts and Crafts movement]] founded by the pupils of Morris. Early prototypes of the style include the Red House of Morris (1859), and the lavish [[Peacock Room]] by [[James Abbott McNeill Whistler]]. The new movement was also strongly influenced by the [[Pre-Raphaelite]] painters, including [[Dante Gabriel Rossetti]] and [[Edward Burne-Jones]], and especially by British graphic artists of the 1880s, including [[Selwyn Image]], [[Heywood Sumner]], [[Walter Crane]], [[Alfred Gilbert]], and especially [[Aubrey Beardsley]].&lt;ref&gt;Bouillon, Jean-Paul, ''Journal de l'Art Nouveau'' (1985), p. 6&lt;/ref&gt;

In France, the style combined several different tendencies. In architecture, it was influenced by the architectural theorist and historian [[Eugène Viollet-le-Duc]], a declared enemy of the historical [[Beaux-Arts architecture|Beaux-Arts architectural style]]. In his 1872 book ''Entretiens sur l'architecture'', he wrote, "use the means and knowledge given to us by our times, without the intervening traditions which are no longer viable today, and in that way we can inaugurate a new architecture. For each function its material; for each material its form and its ornament."&lt;ref&gt;Viollet le-Duc, ''Entretiens sur l'architecture''&lt;/ref&gt;  This book influenced a generation of architects, including [[Louis Sullivan]], [[Victor Horta]], [[Hector Guimard]], and [[Antoni Gaudí]].{{Sfn|Bouillon|1985|page=24}}

The French painters [[Maurice Denis]], [[Pierre Bonnard]] and [[Édouard Vuillard]] played an important part in integrating fine arts painting with decoration. "I believe that before everything a painting must decorate", Denis wrote in 1891. "The choice of subjects or scenes is nothing. It is by the value of tones, the colored surface and the harmony of lines that I can reach the spirit and wake up the emotions."&lt;ref&gt;Interview in ''L'Écho de Paris'', 28 December 1891, cited in Bouillon (1985)&lt;/ref&gt;  These painters all did both traditional painting and decorative painting on screens, in glass, and in other media.{{Sfn|Bouillon|1985|page=26}}

Another important influence on the new style was [[Japonism]]: the wave of enthusiasm for Japanese [[woodblock printing]], particularly the works of [[Hiroshige]], [[Hokusai]], and [[Utagawa Kunisada]] which were imported into Europe beginning in the 1870s. The enterprising [[Siegfried Bing]] founded a monthly journal, ''Le Japon artistique'' in 1888, and published thirty-six issues before it ended in 1891. It influenced both collectors and artists, including [[Gustav Klimt]]. The stylized features of Japanese prints appeared in Art Nouveau graphics, porcelain,  jewelry, and furniture.

New technologies in printing and publishing allowed Art Nouveau to quickly reach a global audience. Art magazines, illustrated with photographs and color [[lithographs]], played an essential role in popularizing the new style. ''[[The Studio (magazine)|The Studio]]'' in England, ''Arts et idèes'' and ''Art et décoration'' in France, and ''[[Jugend]]'' in Germany allowed the style to spread rapidly to all corners of Europe. [[Aubrey Beardsley]] in England, and [[Eugène Grasset]], [[Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec]], and [[Félix Vallotton]] achieved international recognition as illustrators.{{Sfn|Lahor|2007|page=30}}

With the posters by [[Jules Cheret]] for dancer [[Loie Fuller]] in 1893, and by [[Alphonse Mucha]] for actress [[Sarah Bernhardt]] in 1895, the poster became not just advertising, but an art form. [[Toulouse-Lautrec]] and other artists achieved international celebrity status.

===Maison de l'Art Nouveau (1895)===

&lt;/gallery&gt;
The Franco-German art dealer and publisher [[Siegfried Bing]] played a key role in publicizing the style. In 1891, he founded a magazine devoted to the art of Japan, which helped publicize [[Japonism]] in Europe. In 1892, he organized an exhibit of seven artists, among them [[Pierre Bonnard]], [[Félix Vallotton]], [[Édouard Vuillard]], [[Toulouse-Lautrec]] and [[Eugène Grasset]], which included both modern painting and decorative work. This exhibition was shown at the [[Société Nationale des Beaux-Arts|Société nationale des beaux-arts]] in 1895. In the same year, Bing opened a new gallery at [[Rue de Provence|22 rue de Provence]] in Paris, the ''[[Maison de l'Art Nouveau]]'', devoted to new works in both the fine and decorative arts. The interior and furniture of the gallery were designed by the Belgian architect [[Henry Van de Velde]], one of the pioneers of Art Nouveau architecture. The ''Maison de l'Art Nouveau'' showed paintings by [[Georges Seurat]], [[Paul Signac]] and [[Toulouse-Lautrec]], glass from [[Louis Comfort Tiffany]] and [[Emile Gallé]], jewelry by [[René Lalique]], and posters by [[Aubrey Beardsley]]. The works shown there were not at all uniform in style. Bing wrote in 1902, "Art Nouveau, at the time of its creation, did not aspire in any way to have the honor of becoming a generic term. It was simply the name of a house opened as a rallying point for all the young and ardent artists impatient to show the modernity of their tendencies."{{Sfn|Bouillon|1985}}

===Beginning of Art Nouveau architecture (1893–1898)===

&lt;/gallery&gt;
The first Art Nouveau houses, the [[Hôtel Tassel]] by Victor Horta and the [[Bloemenwerf]] house by [[Henry Van de Velde]], were built in Brussels in 1893–1895. Both Horta and Van de Velde designed not only the houses, but also all of the interior decoration, furniture, carpets, and architectural details.

Horta, an architect with classical training, designed the residence of a prominent Belgian chemist, Émile Tassel, on a very narrow and deep site. The central element became the stairway, beneath a high skylight. The floors were supported by slender iron columns like the trunks of trees. The mosaic floors and walls were decorated with delicate arabesques in floral and vegetal forms, which became the most popular signature of Art Nouveau.{{Sfn|Lahor|2007|page=127}}

Van de Velde was by training a designer, not an architect, and collaborated with an architect on the plan of the [[Bloemenwerf]], the house that he built for himself. He was inspired by the British Arts and Crafts Movement, particularly William Morris's Red House, and like them he designed all aspects of the building, including the furniture, wallpaper and carpets.

After visiting Horta's Hôtel Tassel, [[Hector Guimard]] built the [[Castel Béranger]], the first Paris building in the new style, between 1895 and 1898. Parisians had been complaining of the monotony of the architecture of the boulevards built under [[Napoleon III]] by [[Georges-Eugène Haussmann]]. They welcomed Guimard's colorful and picturesque style; the Castel Béranger was chosen as one of the best new façades in Paris, launching Guimard's career. Guimard was given the commission to design the entrances for the new [[Paris Métro]] system, which brought the style to the attention of the millions of visitors to the city's 1900 [[Exposition Universelle (1900)|''Exposition Universelle'']].&lt;ref name="Gontar, Cybele 2006"&gt;[http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/artn/hd_artn.htm Gontar, Cybele.

===Paris ''Exposition universelle'' (1900)===

&lt;/gallery&gt;
The Paris 1900 [[Exposition Universelle (1900)|''Exposition universelle'']] marked the high point of Art Nouveau. Between April and November 1900, it attracted nearly fifty million visitors from around the world, and showcased the architecture, design, glassware, furniture and decorative objects of the style. The architecture of the Exposition was often a mixture of Art Nouveau and [[Beaux-Arts architecture]]: the main exhibit hall, the [[Grand Palais]] had a Beaux-Arts façade completely unrelated to the spectacular Art Nouveau stairway and exhibit hall in the interior.

The Exposition particularly highlighted French designers, who all made special works for the Exhibition: [[Lalique]] crystal and jewelry; jewelry by [[Henri Vever]] and [[Georges Fouquet]]; [[Daum (studio)|Daum]] glass; the [[Manufacture nationale de Sèvres]] in [[porcelain]]; ceramics by [[Alexandre Bigot]]; sculpted glass lamps and vases by [[Emile Gallé]] and [[Louis Comfort Tiffany]], and Company from the United States; furniture by [[Édouard Colonna]] and [[Louis Majorelle]]; and many other prominent arts and crafts firms from around Europe and the world. At the 1900 Paris Exposition, [[Siegfried Bing]] presented a pavilion called '' Art Nouveau Bing'', which featured six different interiors entirely decorated in the Style.&lt;ref name="eidelberg"&gt;Martin Eidelberg and Suzanne Henrion-Giele, "Horta and Bing: An Unwritten Episode of L'Art Nouveau", ''The Burlington Magazine'', vol. 119, Special Issue Devoted to European Art Since 1890 (Nov. 1977), pp. 747–752.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="duncanbing"&gt;Duncan (1994), pp. 15–16, 25–27.&lt;/ref&gt;

While the Paris Exposition was by far the largest, other expositions did much to popularize the style. The [[1888 Barcelona Universal Exposition]] marked the beginning of the [[Modernisme]] style in Spain, with some buildings of [[Lluís Domènech i Montaner]]. The [[Esposizione Internazionale d'Arte Decorativa Moderna (1902)|''Esposizione internazionale d'arte decorativa moderna'']] of 1902 in [[Turin]], Italy, showcased designers from across Europe.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

Following the 1900 Exposition, the capital of Art Nouveau was Paris. The most extravagant residences in the style were built by [[Jules Lavirotte]], who entirely covered the façades with ceramic sculptural decoration. The most flamboyant example is the [[Lavirotte Building]], at 29 avenue Rapp (1901). Office buildings and department stores featured high courtyards covered with stained glass cupolas and ceramic decoration. The style was particularly popular in restaurants and cafés, including ''[[Maxim's]]'' at [[Rue Royale, Paris|3 rue Royale]], and [[Le Train Bleu (restaurant)|''Le Train bleu'']] at the [[Gare de Lyon]] (1900).{{Sfn|Texier|2012|pages=86–87}}

The city of [[Nancy, France|Nancy]] in [[Lorraine]] became the other French capital of the new style. In 1901, the ''Alliance provinciale des industries d'art'', also known as the ''[[École de Nancy]]'', was founded, dedicated to upsetting the hierarchy that put painting and sculpture above the decorative arts.  The major artists working there included the glass vase and lamp creators [[Emile Gallé]], the [[Daum (studio)|Daum]] brothers in glass design, and the designer [[Louis Majorelle]], who created furniture with graceful floral and vegetal forms. The architect [[Henri Sauvage]] brought the new architectural style to Nancy with his [[Villa Majorelle]] in 1898.

The French style was widely propagated by new magazines, including ''The Studio'', ''Arts et Idées'' and ''Art et Décoration'', whose photographs and color lithographs made the style known to designers and wealthy clients around the world.

In France, the style reached its summit in 1900, and thereafter slipped rapidly out of fashion,  virtually disappearing from France by 1905. Art Nouveau was a luxury style, which required expert and highly-paid craftsmen, and could not be easily or cheaply mass-produced. One of the few Art Nouveau products that could be mass-produced was the perfume bottle, and these continue to be manufactured in the style today.

Belgium was an early center of the Art Nouveau, thanks largely to the architecture of [[Victor Horta]], who designed the first Art Nouveau houses, the [[Hôtel Tassel]] in 1893, and the [[Hôtel Solvay]] in 1894. Horta met and had a strong influence on the work of the young [[Hector Guimard]]. Other important designers included architect [[Paul Hankar]], who built an Art Nouveau house in 1893; the architect and furniture designer [[Henry van de Velde]], the decorator [[Gustave Serrurier-Bovy]], and the graphic artist [[Fernand Khnopff]].&lt;ref&gt;Lahor, ''L'Art Nouveau'', p. 91.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="unescohorta"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/1005|title=Major Town Houses of the Architect Victor Horta (Brussels)|first=UNESCO World Heritage|last=Centre|website=whc.unesco.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sterner (1982), pp. 38–42.&lt;/ref&gt;  Belgian designers took advantage of an abundant supply of [[ivory]] imported from the [[Belgian Congo]]; mixed sculptures, combining stone, metal and ivory, by such artists as [[Philippe Wolfers]], was popular.{{Sfn|Riley|2004|page=323}}

In the Netherlands, the style was known as the ''Nieuwe Kunst'', the New Art. Architects included [[Hendrik Petrus Berlage]], who designed a more functional, rational variant, while [[Carel Adolph Lion Cachet]], [[Theo Nieuwenhuis]] and [[Gerrit Willem Dijsselhof]] designed a more picturesque and decorative style. Furniture design was influenced by the importation of exotic woods from the Dutch East Indies (modern [[Indonesia]]), while textiles were influenced by the designs and techniques of [[batik]].{{Sfn|Riley|2004|page=323}}

Prominent Swiss artists of the period included painter and graphic artist [[Théophile Steinlen]], creator of the famous poster for the Paris [[cabaret]] [[Le Chat Noir|''Le Chat noir'']], and the artist, sculptor and decorator [[Eugène Grasset]], who moved from Switzerland to Paris where he designed graphics, furniture, tapestries, ceramics and posters. In Paris, he taught at the Guérin school of art (''École normale d'enseignement du dessin''), where his students included [[Augusto Giacometti]] and [[Paul Berthon]].&lt;ref&gt;Lahor, ''L'Art Nouveau'', p. 104&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="duncan37"&gt;Duncan (1994), p. 37.&lt;/ref&gt;

Art Nouveau had its roots in Britain, in the [[arts and crafts movement]] of the 1880s, which called for a closer union between the fine arts and decorative arts, and a break away from historical styles to designs inspired by function and nature. One notable early example [[Arthur Mackmurdo]]'s design for the cover of his essay on the city churches of [[Sir Christopher Wren]], published in 1883.

Other important innovators in Britain included the graphic designers [[Aubrey Beardsley]] whose drawings featured the curved lines which became the most recognizable feature of the style. free-flowing [[wrought iron]] from the 1880s could also be adduced, or some flat floral textile designs, most of which owed some impetus to patterns of 19th century design. Other British graphic artists who had an important place in the style included [[Walter Crane]] and [[Charles Robert Ashbee|Charles Ashbee]].&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huntfor.com/arthistory/c19th/artnouveau.htm|title=Art Nouveau - Art Nouveau Art|date=22 February 2013|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130222070337/http://www.huntfor.com/arthistory/c19th/artnouveau.htm|archivedate=22 February 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Liberty (department store)|Liberty]] department store in London played an important role, through its colorful stylized floral designs for textiles, and the silver, pewter, and jewelry designs of Manxman (of Scottish descent) [[Archibald Knox (designer)|Archibald Knox]]. His jewelry designs in materials and forms broke away entirely from the historical traditions of jewelry design.

For Art Nouveau architecture and furniture design, the most important center in Britain was [[Glasgow, Scotland|Glasgow]], with the creations of [[Charles Rennie Mackintosh]] and the [[Glasgow School]], whose work was inspired by the French Art Nouveau, Japanese art, symbolism and Gothic revival. Beginning in 1895, Mackintosh displayed his designs at international expositions in London, Vienna, and Turin; his designs particularly influenced the Secession Style in Vienna. His architectural creations included the Glasgow Herald Building (1894) and the library of the [[Glasgow School of Art]] (1897). He also established a major reputation as a furniture designer and decorator, working closely with his wife, [[Margaret Macdonald Mackintosh]], a prominent painter and designer. Together they created striking designs which combined geometric straight lines with gently curving floral decoration, particularly a famous symbol of the style, the ''Glasgow Rose".{{Sfn|Lahor|page=160}}

[[Léon-Victor Solon]], made an important contribution to Art Nouveau ceramics as art director at Mintons. He specialised in plaques and in [[Tubelining|tube-lined]] vases marketed as "secessionist ware" (usually described as named after the [[Viennese Secession|Viennese art movement]]).&lt;ref name="Muter"&gt;{{cite journal | jstor=41809144 | title=Leon Solon and John Wadsworth | work=Journal of the Decorative Arts Society | year=1985 | author=Muter, Grant}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Apart from ceramics, he designed textiles for the [[Thomas Wardle (industrialist)|Leek silk industry]]&lt;ref&gt;He was commissioned by the Wardle family of dyers and printers, trading as "Thomas Wardle &amp; Co" and "Bernard Wardle and Co".[http://www.whitworth.manchester.ac.uk/collection/recentprojects/wardle/ The Wardel Pattern Books Revealed]{{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203044031/http://www.whitworth.manchester.ac.uk/collection/recentprojects/wardle/ |date=3 December 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[doublure (bookbinding)|doublure]]s for a bookbinder (G.T.Bagguley of Newcastle under Lyme), who patented the ''Sutherland'' binding in 1895.

The Edward Everard building in Bristol, built during 1900–01 to house the [[Former Everard's Printing Works|printing works of Edward Everard]], features an Art Nouveau façade. The figures depicted are of [[Johannes Gutenberg]] and [[William Morris]], both eminent in the field of printing. A winged figure symbolises the "Spirit of Light", while a figure holding a lamp and mirror symbolises light and truth.

&lt;/gallery&gt;
German Art Nouveau is commonly known by its German name, ''Jugendstil''. The name is taken from the artistic journal, ''[[Jugend (magazine)|Die Jugend]]'', which was published in Munich and which espoused the new artistic movement. It was founded in 1896 by [[Georg Hirth]] (Hirth remained editor until his death in 1916, and the magazine continued to be published until 1940). The magazine was instrumental in promoting the style in Germany. As a result, its name was adopted as the most common German-language term for the style: ''Jugendstil'' ("youth style"). Although, during the early 20th century, the word was applied to only two-dimensional examples of the graphic arts,&lt;ref&gt;A. Philip McMahon, "review of F. Schmalenbach, ''Jugendstil''", ''Parnassus'', vol. 7 (Oct., 1935), 27.&lt;/ref&gt; especially the forms of organic [[typography]] and [[graphic design]] found in and influenced by German magazines like ''[[Jugend (magazine)|Jugend]]'', ''[[Pan (magazine)|Pan]]'', and ''[[Simplicissimus]]'', it is now applied to more general manifestations of Art Nouveau visual arts in Germany, the [[Netherlands]], the [[Baltic states]], and [[Nordic countries]].&lt;ref name="grove" /&gt;&lt;ref name="heller"&gt;Reinhold Heller, "Recent Scholarship on Vienna's "Golden Age", Gustav Klimt, and Egon Schiele", ''The Art Bulletin'', vol. 59 (Mar., 1977), pp. 111–118.&lt;/ref&gt; The two main centres for Jugendstil art in Germany were [[Munich]] and [[Darmstadt]] ([[Darmstadt Artists' Colony|Mathildenhöhe]]).

Two other journals, ''[[Simplicissimus]]'', published in Munich, and ''[[Pan (magazine)|Pan]]'', published in Berlin, proved to be important proponents of the Jugendstil. The magazines were important for spreading the visual idiom of ''Jugendstil'', especially the graphical qualities. Jugendstil art includes a variety of different methods, applied by the various individual artists and features the use of hard lines as well as sinuous curves. Methods range from classic to romantic. One feature of Jugendstil is the typography used, the letter and image combination of which is unmistakable. The combination was used for covers of novels, advertisements, and [[Art exhibition|exhibition]] [[poster]]s. Designers often used unique display [[typeface]]s that worked harmoniously with the image.

One of the most famous German artists associated with both ''Die Jugend'' and ''Pan'' was [[Otto Eckmann]]. His favourite animal was the swan, and such was his influence in the German movement that the swan came to serve as the [[leitmotif]] for the Jugendstil.

One of the most prominent German designers in the style was [[Richard Riemerschmid]], who made furniture, pottery, and other decorative objects in a sober, geometric style that pointed forward toward Art Deco.{{Sfn|Lahor|2007|page=52}}

{{Main article|Vienna Secession}}
Vienna became the center of a distinct variant of Art Nouveau, which became known as the [[Vienna Secession]], an art movement that was founded in April 1897 by a group of artists which included [[Gustav Klimt]], [[Koloman Moser]], [[Josef Hoffmann]], [[Joseph Maria Olbrich]], [[Max Kurzweil]], and [[Otto Wagner]]. The painter Klimt became the president of the group. They objected to the conservative orientation toward [[historicism]] expressed by [[Vienna Künstlerhaus]], the official union of artists. The Secession founded a magazine, ''[[Ver Sacrum]]'', to promote their works in all media. The Secession style was notably more feminine, less heavy and less nationalist than the ''Jugendstil'' in neighboring Germany.{{Sfn|Lahor|2007|page=63}} The architect Joseph Olbrich designed the domed Secession building in the new style, which became a showcase for the paintings of Gustav Klimt and other Secession artists. The architectural style of the Vienna Secession had an influence well beyond the city. Buildings in the style appeared in the other major cities of the Empire and beyond; one of the most famous examples is the [[Stoclet Palace]] built by Josef Hoffmann in Brussels in 1905–11. The interior is entirely decorated in Secession style, including notable paintings by Gustav Klimt.

Klimt became the best-known of the Secession painters, often erasing the border between fine art painting and decorative painting. [[Koloman Moser]] was an extremely versatile artist in the style; his work including magazine illustrations, architecture, silverware, ceramics, porcelain, textiles, stained glass windows, furniture, and more. He often worked in collaboration with Hoffmann and Klimt; the three together created the interiors, furnishing and even clothing to be worn in the Stoclet Palace in Brussels. In 1903, he and Hoffmann founded the [[Wiener Werkstätte]], a training school and workshop for designers and craftsmen of furniture, carpets, textiles and decorative objects.{{Sfn|Lahor|2007|page=120}}

&lt;/gallery&gt;
In the capitals of Central Europe, then ruled by the [[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian Empire]] in Vienna, national forms of Art Nouveau are quick to appear, and often took on historical or folkloric elements. The furniture designs of [[Ödön Faragó]] in [[Budapest]] ([[Hungary]]) combined traditional popular architecture, oriental architecture and international Art Nouveau in a highly picturesque style. [[Pál Horti]], another Hungarian designer, had a much more sober and functional style, made of oak with delicate traceries of ebony and brass.

[[Prague]], in the [[Czech Republic]], has a notable collection of Art Nouveau architecture, including the ''Hotel Central'' and the [[Jubilee Synagogue]], built in 1908.

The style of combining Art Nouveau and national architectural elements was typical also for a [[Slovakia|Slovak]] architect [[Dušan Jurkovič]] who was under the influence of Hungarian Art Nouveau. His most original works are the Cultural House in [[Skalica]] in [[Slovakia]] (1905), buildings of spa in [[Luhačovice]] in the [[Czech Republic]] (1901–1903) and 35 war cemeteries near [[Nowy Żmigród]] in [[Galicia (Eastern Europe)|Galicia]] (now Poland), most of them heavily influenced by local Lemko ([[Rusyns|Rusyn]]) folk art and carpentry (1915–1917). Another example of Secession architecture in Slovakia is the [[Church of St. Elisabeth (Bratislava)|Church of St. Elisabeth]] (The Little Blue Church) in [[Bratislava]].

&lt;/gallery&gt;

Italy's ''Stile Liberty'' took its name from the British department store [[Liberty (store)|Liberty]], the colorful textiles of which were particularly popular in Italy. Notable Italian designers included [[Galileo Chini]], whose ceramics were inspired both by [[majolica]] patterns and by Art Nouveau. He was later known as a painter and a scenic designer; he designed the sets for two Puccini operas  ''[[Gianni Schicchi]]'' and ''[[Turandot]]''.

The [[Teatro Massimo]] in [[Palermo]], by the architect [[Ernesto Basile]], is an example of the Italian variant of the style, architectural style, which combined Art Nouveau and classical elements.

The most important figure in Italian Art Nouveau furniture design was [[Carlo Bugatti]], the son of an architect and sculptor, and brother of the famous automobile designer. He studied at the [[Brera Academy|Milanese Academy of Brera]], and later the [[Académie des Beaux-Arts]] in [[Paris]]. His work was distinguished by its exoticism and eccentricity, included silverware, textiles, ceramics, and musical instruments, but he is best remembered for his innovative furniture designs, shown first in the 1888 Milan Fine Arts Fair. His furniture often featured a keyhole design, and had unusual coverings, including parchment and silk, and inlays of bone and ivory. It also sometimes had surprising organic shapes, copied after snails and cobras.{{Sfn|Riley|2007|page=310}}

&lt;/gallery&gt;

In Spain, a highly original variant of the style, Catalan ''[[Modernisme]]'', appeared in [[Barcelona]]. Its most famous creator was [[Antoni Gaudi|Antoni Gaudí]], who used Art Nouveau's floral and organic forms in a very novel way in ''[[Palau Güell]]'' (1886).{{Sfn|Lahor|2007|page=142}}&lt;ref&gt;James Grady, ''Special Bibliographical Supplement: A Bibliography of the Art Nouveau'', in "The Journal of the Society of Architectural Historians", vol. 14 (May, 1955), pp. 18–27.&lt;/ref&gt; His designs from about 1903, the ''[[Casa Batlló]]'' (1904–1906) and ''[[Casa Milà]]'' (1906–1908), are most closely related to the stylistic elements of Art Nouveau.&lt;ref name="duncan52"&gt;Duncan (1994): 52.&lt;/ref&gt; However, famous structures such as the ''[[Sagrada Família]]'' characteristically contrast the modernising Art Nouveau tendencies with revivalist [[Neo-Gothic]].&lt;ref name="duncan52" /&gt; Besides the dominating presence of Gaudí, [[Lluís Domènech i Montaner]] also used Art Nouveau in Barcelona in buildings such as the [[Castell dels Tres Dragons]] (1888), [[Palau de la Música Catalana]] and [[Casa Lleó Morera]] (1905).&lt;ref name="duncan52" /&gt; Another major modernista was [[Josep Puig i Cadafalch]], who designed the [[Casa Martí]] and its Quatre Gats café, the Casimir Casaramona textile factory (now the [[Caixa Forum|CaixaFòrum]] art museum), Casa Macaya, [[Casa Amatller]], the Palau del Baró de Quadras (housing Casa Àsia for 10 years until 2013) and the Casa de les Punxes ("House of Spikes"). Also well-known is [[Josep Maria Jujol]], with houses in [[Sant Joan Despí]] (1913–1926), several churches near [[Tarragona]] (1918 and 1926) and the sinuous Casa Planells (1924) in [[Barcelona]]. A few other major architects working outside of Barcelona were Lluís Muncunill i Parellada, with a magnificent textile factory in [[Terrassa]] (Vapor Aymerich, Amat i Jover, now the Science and Technology Museum of Catalonia – Museu de la Ciència i de la Tècnica de Catalunya) and a "farmhouse"/small manor house called Masia Freixa in the same city; and [[Cèsar Martinell i Brunet]], with his spectacular "wine cathedrals", housing town cooperative wineries throughout southern and central [[Catalonia]]. A [[Valencian Country|Valencian]] architect who worked in Catalonia before emigrating to the [[United States|States]] was [[Rafael Guastavino]]. Attributed to him is the Asland Cement Factory in [[Castellar de n'Hug]], among other buildings.

The Catalan furniture designer Gaspar Homar (1870–1953), influenced by Antoni Gaudí, often combining marquetry and mosaics with his furnishings.{{Sfn|Riley|2007|page=311}} Examples of Art Nouveau (''Arte nova''), based largely on the French model, appeared in Portugal in [[Porto]] and [[Aveiro, Portugal|Aveiro]].  A notable example is the '[[Livraria Lello]]' bookstore in [[Porto]], designed by Xavier Esteves (1906).

Art Nouveau was popular in the [[Nordic countries]], where it was usually known as [[Jugendstil]], and was often combined with the [[National Romantic Style]] of each country. In [[Norway]] the Art Nouveau was connected with a revival inspired by [[Viking]] folk art and crafts. Notable designers included Lars Kisarvik, who designed chairs with traditional Viking and [[Celts|Celtic]] patterns, and [[Gerhard Munthe]], who designed a chair with a stylized dragon-head emblem from ancient Viking ships, as well as a wide variety of posters, paintings and graphics.{{Sfn|Riley|2007|page=312}} Other examples include the [[Skien Church]] (1887–1894) and [[Fagerborg Church]] in [[Kristiania]] (Oslo) (1900–1903).

In [[Finland]], good examples are the [[Helsinki Central railway station]], designed by [[Eliel Saarinen]], father of the famous American modernist architect [[Eero Saarinen]]. Examples of the style include the [[Finnish National Theatre]], [[Kallio Church]], the [[Finnish National Museum]], and [[Tampere Cathedral]]. In contrast to the very elaborate furniture of the Norwegian Art Nouveau, Finnish Art Deco was extremely simple and functional, as in the chairs designed by Eliel Saarinen (1907-1908).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.visitfinland.com/article/the-charm-of-old-helsinki/|title=The Charm of Old Helsinki — VisitFinland.com|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.artnouveau.eu/en/city.php?id=136|title=Art Nouveau European Route : Cities|website=www.artnouveau.eu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;
A very colorful Russian variation of Art Nouveau appeared in Moscow and [[Saint Petersburg]] in 1898 with the publication of a new art journal, "Мир искусства" (transliteration: ''[[Mir Iskusstva]]'') ("The World of Art"), by Russian artists [[Alexandre Benois]] and [[Léon Bakst]], and chief editor [[Sergei Diaghilev]]. The magazine organized exhibitions of leading Russian artists, including [[Mikhail Vrubel]], [[Konstantin Somov]], [[Isaac Levitan]], and the book illustrator [[Ivan Bilibin]]. The World of Art style made less use of the vegetal and floral forms of French Art Nouveau; it drew heavily upon the bright colors and exotic designs of Russian folklore and fairy tales. The most influential contribution of the "World of Art" was the creation by Diaghilev of a new ballet company, the ''[[Ballets Russes]]'', headed by Diaghilev, with costumes and sets designed by Bakst and Benois. The new ballet company premiered in Paris in 1909, and performed there every year through 1913. The exotic and colorful sets designed by Benois and Bakst had a major impact on French art and design. The costume and set designs were reproduced in the leading Paris magazines, ''[[L'Illustration]]'', [[La Vie Parisienne (magazine)|''La Vie parisienne'']] and [[Gazette du Bon Ton|''Gazette du bon ton'']], and the Russian style became known in Paris as ''à la Bakst''. The company was stranded in Paris first by the outbreak of World War I, and then by the [[Russian Revolution]] in 1917, and ironically never performed in Russia.&lt;ref&gt;Duncan, Alistair, ''Art déco'', Thames and Hudson (1988), pp. 147–48&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Moscow]] and [[Saint Petersburg]] have several prominent Art Nouveau buildings constructed in the last years before the Revolution; notably the [[Hotel Metropol (Moscow)|Hotel Metropol]] in Moscow, which features a ceramic mural on the façade, ''The Princess of Dreams'', by scenic designer [[Mikhail Vrubel]];  and the [[Vitebsk Railway Station]] in Saint Petersburg (1904)

&lt;/gallery&gt;
In the United States, the firm of [[Louis Comfort Tiffany]] played a central role in American Art Nouveau. Born in 1848, he studied at the [[National Academy Museum and School|National Academy of Design]] in New York, began working with glass at the age of 24, entered the family business started by his father, and 1885 set up his own enterprise devoted to fine glass, and developed new techniques for its coloring. In 1893, he began making glass vases and bowls, again developing new techniques that allowed more original shapes and coloring, and began experimenting with decorative window glass. Layers of glass were printed, marbled and superimposed, giving an exceptional richness and variety of color In 1895 his new works were featured in the Art Nouveau gallery of Siegfried Bing, giving him a new European clientele. After the death of his father in 1902, he took over the entire Tiffany enterprise, but still devoted much of his time to designing and manufacturing glass art objects. At the urging of [[Thomas Edison]], he began to manufacture electric lamps with multicolored glass shades in structures of bronze and iron, or decorated with mosaics, produced in numerous series and editions, each made with the care of a piece of jewelry. A team of designers and craftsmen worked on each product. The Tiffany lamp in particular became one of the icons of the Art Nouveau, but Tiffany's craftsmen (and craftswomen) designed and made extraordinary windows, vases, and other glass art. Tiffany's glass also had great success at the [[Exposition Universelle (1900)|''1900 Exposition Universelle'']] in Paris; his stained glass window called the ''Flight of Souls'' won a gold medal.{{Sfn|Lahor|2007|page=167}}

Another important figure in American Art Nouveau was the architect [[Louis Sullivan]], best known as the architect of some of the first American iron-framed skyscrapers. At the 1893 [[World's Columbian Exposition]] in Chicago, most famous for the neoclassical architecture of its renowned ''White City'', he designed a spectacular Art Nouveau entrance to the Transportation Building. The Columbian Exposition was also an important venue for Tiffany; a chapel he designed was shown at the Pavilion of Art and Industry. The Tiffany Chapel, along with one of the windows of Tiffany's home in New York, are now on display at the [[Charles Hosmer Morse Museum of American Art]] in [[Winter Park, Florida]].

==Form and character==
[[File:Théophile-Alexandre Steinlen - Tournée du Chat Noir de Rodolphe Salis (Tour of Rodolphe Salis' Chat Noir) - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|left|upright|''La tournée du Chat noir de Rodolphe Salis'' (1896) by [[Théophile Steinlen]]]]

Although Art Nouveau acquired distinctly localised tendencies as its geographic spread increased, some general characteristics are indicative of the form. A description published in ''Pan'' magazine of [[Hermann Obrist]]'s wall hanging ''Cyclamen'' (1894) described it as "sudden violent curves generated by the crack of a whip", which became well known during the early spread of Art Nouveau.&lt;ref name="duncan27"&gt;Duncan (1994): 27–28.&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, not only did the work itself become better known as ''The Whiplash'' but the term "whiplash" is frequently applied to the characteristic curves employed by Art Nouveau artists.&lt;ref name="duncan27" /&gt; Such decorative "whiplash" motifs, formed by dynamic, undulating, and flowing lines in a syncopated rhythm and asymmetrical shape, are found throughout the architecture, painting, sculpture, and other forms of Art Nouveau design.

The origins of Art Nouveau are sometimes attributed in the resistance of the artist [[William Morris]] to the cluttered compositions and the [[Gothic revival|revival]] tendencies of the 19th century and his theories that helped initiate the [[Arts and crafts movement]].&lt;ref name="duncan10"&gt;Duncan (1994): 10–13.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Arthur Mackmurdo]]'s book-cover for ''[[Christopher Wren|Wren]]'s City Churches'' (1883), with its rhythmic floral patterns, is also sometimes described as the first realisation of Art Nouveau.&lt;ref name="duncan10" /&gt; About the same time, the flat perspective and strong colors of [[Ukiyo-e|Japanese wood block prints]], especially those of [[Katsushika Hokusai]], had a strong effect on the formulation of Art Nouveau.&lt;ref name="duncan14"&gt;Duncan (1994): 14–18.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Japonisme]]'' that was popular in Europe during the 1880s and 1890s was particularly influential on many artists with its organic forms and references to the natural world.&lt;ref name ="duncan14" /&gt; Besides being adopted by artists like [[Emile Gallé]] and [[James Abbott McNeill Whistler]], Japanese-inspired art and design was championed by the businessmen [[Siegfried Bing]] and [[Arthur Lasenby Liberty]] at their stores&lt;ref&gt;Before opening the ''Maison de l'Art Nouveau'', Bing managed a shop specialising in items from Japan; after 1888, he promoted Japanism with his magazine [[Artistic Japan|''Le Japon artistique'']]: Duncan (1994): 15–16.&lt;/ref&gt; in Paris and London, respectively.&lt;ref name="duncan14" /&gt; &lt;!--If confirmed: "One of the first Art Nouveau paintings can be found at [[Roquetaillade castle]] (France). [[Viollet-le-Duc]] restored the castle during the 1850s, and, even though his ideal was to create a [[Gothic revival]], his [[fresco]] in the keep of the castle is a pure example of "pre" Art Nouveau style—organic movement and color. "--&gt;

In architecture, [[hyperbola]]s and [[parabola]]s in windows, arches, and doors are common, and decorative [[:molding (decorative)|mouldings]] 'grow' into plant-derived forms. Like most design styles, Art Nouveau sought to harmonise its forms. The text above the Paris Metro entrance uses the qualities of the rest of the iron work in the structure.&lt;ref&gt;Sterner (1982), 21.&lt;/ref&gt;

Art Nouveau in architecture and interior design eschewed the eclectic revival styles of the 19th century. Though Art Nouveau, designers selected and 'modernised' some of the more abstract elements of [[Rococo]] style, such as [[flame]] and [[Animal shell|shell]] textures, they also advocated the use of very stylised organic forms as a source of inspiration, expanding the 'natural' repertoire to use [[seaweed]], [[grass]]es, and insects. The softly-melding forms of 17th-century [[auricular style]], best exemplified in Dutch silverware, was another influence.

==Relationship with contemporary styles and movements==
[[File:Gustav Klimt, 1907, Adele Bloch-Bauer I, Neue Galerie New York.jpg|thumb|left|upright0.1||''[[Portrait of Adele Bloch-Bauer I]]'' by [[Gustav Klimt]] (1907)]]
As an art style, Art Nouveau has affinities with the [[Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood|Pre-Raphaelites]] and the [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolist]] styles, and artists like [[Aubrey Beardsley]], [[Alphonse Mucha]], [[Edward Burne-Jones]], [[Gustav Klimt]] and [[Jan Toorop]] could be classed in more than one of these styles. Unlike Symbolist painting, however, Art Nouveau has a distinctive appearance; and, unlike the [[artisan]]-oriented [[Arts and Crafts Movement]], Art Nouveau artists readily used new materials, machined surfaces, and [[abstraction]] in the service of pure design.

Art Nouveau did not eschew the use of machines, as the Arts and Crafts Movement did. For sculpture, the principal materials employed were glass and wrought iron, resulting in sculptural qualities even in architecture. Ceramics were also employed in creating editions of sculptures by artists such as [[Auguste Rodin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.musee-rodin.fr/communication/images/CPrevejaponais_anglais.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-06-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110726155845/http://www.musee-rodin.fr/communication/images/CPrevejaponais_anglais.pdf |archivedate=26 July 2011 |df=dmy }} Edmond Lachenal produced editions of Rodin's sculptures&lt;/ref&gt;

Art Nouveau architecture made use of many [[technology|technological]] innovations of the late 19th century, especially the use of exposed iron and large, irregularly shaped pieces of glass for architecture.
 
Art Nouveau tendencies were also absorbed into local styles. In [[Denmark]], for example, it was one aspect of ''Skønvirke'' ("aesthetic work"), which itself more closely relates to the [[Arts and Crafts style]].&lt;ref&gt;Jennifer Opie, ''A Dish by Thorvald Bindesbøll'', in ''The Burlington Magazine'', vol. 132 (May, 1990), pp. 356.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Claire Selkurt, "New Classicism: Design of the 1920s in Denmark", in ''The Journal of Decorative and Propaganda Arts'', vol. 4 (Spring, 1987), pp. 16–29 (esp. 18 n. 4).&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, artists adopted many of the floral and organic motifs of Art Nouveau into the ''[[Młoda Polska]]'' ("Young Poland") style in [[Poland]].&lt;ref&gt;Danuta A. Boczar, ''The Polish Poster'', in ''Art Journal'', vol. 44 (Spring, 1984), pp. 16–27 (esp. 16).&lt;/ref&gt; ''Młoda Polska'', however, was also inclusive of other artistic styles and encompassed a broader approach to art, literature, and lifestyle.&lt;ref&gt;Danuta Batorska, "Zofia Stryjeńska: Princess of Polish Painting", in ''Woman's Art Journal'', vol. 19 (Autumn, 1998–Winter, 1999), pp. 24–29 (esp. 24–25).&lt;/ref&gt;

The graphic arts flourished in the Art Nouveau period, thanks to new technologies of printing, particularly color [[lithography]] which allowed the mass production of color posters. Art was no longer confined to galleries, museums and salons; it could be found on Paris walls, and in illustrated art magazines, which circulated throughout Europe and to the United States. The most popular theme of Art Nouveau posters was women; women symbolizing glamour, modernity and beauty, often surrounded by flowers.

In Britain, the leading graphic artist in the Art Nouveau style was [[Aubrey Beardsley]] (1872-1898). He began with engraved book illustrations for ''[[Le Morte d'Arthur]]'', then black and white illustrations for [[Salome]] by [[Oscar Wilde]] (1893), which brought him fame. In the same year, he began engraving illustrations and posters for the art magazine ''The Studio'', which helped publicize European artists such as [[Fernand Khnopff]] in Britain. The curving lines and intricate floral patterns attracted as much attention as the text. {{Sfn|Lahor|2007|page=99}}

The Swiss-French artist [[Eugène Grasset]] (1845-1917) was one of the first creators of French Art Nouveau posters. He helped decorate the famous cabaret [[Le Chat Noir|Le Chat noir]] in 1885 and made his first posters for the ''Fêtes de Paris''. He made a celebrated posters of [[Sarah Bernhardt]] in 1890, and a wide variety of book illustrations. The artist-designers [[Jules Chéret]], [[Georges de Feure]] and the painter [[Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec]] all made posters for Paris theaters, cafés, dance halls cabarets. The [[Czechs|Czech]] artist [[Alphonse Mucha]] (1860–1939) arrived in Paris in 1888, and in 1895 made a poster for actress Sarah Bernhardt in the play ''[[Gismonda]]'' by [[Victorien Sardou]]. The success of this poster led to a contract to produce posters for six more plays by Bernhardt. Over the next four years, he also designed sets, costumes, and even jewelry for the actress.&lt;ref name="Johnston"&gt;''[http://www.mala.bc.ca/~Johnstoi/praguepage/muchalecture.htm An Introduction to the Work of Alphonse Mucha and Art Nouveau]'', lecture by [[Ian Johnston (academic)|Ian Johnston]] of [[Malaspina University-College]], [[Nanaimo]], British Columbia.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fraser, Julie. H. [http://www.style2000.com/p05b.html "Recycling art"] style2000.com.&lt;/ref&gt; Based on the success of his theater posters, Mucha made posters for a variety of products, ranging from cigarettes and soap to beer biscuits, all featuring an idealized female figure with an hourglass figure.  He went on to design products, from jewelry to biscuit boxes, in his distinctive style. {{Sfn|Lahor|2007|page=112}}

In Vienna, the most prolific designer of graphics and posters was [[Koloman Moser]] (1868-1918), who actively participated in the Secession movement with [[Gustav Klimt]] and [[Josef Hoffmann]], and made illustrations and covers for the magazine of the movement, ''Ver Sacrum'', as well as paintings, furniture and decoration.{{Sfn|Lahor|pages=120-121}}

&lt;/gallery&gt;
Painting was another important domain of Art Nouveau, though most Art Nouveau painters were also associated with other art movements, particularly the [[Nabis]] in France and the [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolists]] in France and Austria. In 1892, [[Siegfried Bing]] organized an exhibition in Paris featuring seven painters, including [[Pierre Bonnard]], [[Édouard Vuillard]], [[Félix Vallotton]], and [[Maurice Denis]]; and his ''Maison de l'Art Nouveau'' exhibited paintings by [[Georges Seurat]], [[Paul Signac]], and [[Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec]]. [[Eugène Grasset]], [[Koloman Moser]] and [[Gustav Klimt]] moved comfortably in the avant-garde and Art Nouveau. In Belgium, [[Fernand Khnopff]] worked in both painting and graphic design. Paintings by Gustav Klimt were an integral part of he decorative scheme of [[Josef Hoffmann]] for the [[Palais Stoclet]]. One common theme of both symbolist and Art Nouveau painters of the period was the stylized depiction of women. One popular subject was the American dancer [[Loie Fuller]], portrayed by French and Austrian painters and poster artists.&lt;ref&gt;Bouillon, Jean-Paul, ''Journal de l'Art Nouveau (1870-1914)'', Skira, 1985&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Glass art]] was a medium in which Art Nouveau found new and varied ways of expression. Intense amount of experimentation went on, particularly in France, to find new effects of transparency and opacity: in engraving win cameo, double layers, and acid engraving, a technique which permitted production in series. The city of [[Nancy, France|Nancy]] became an important center for the French glass industry, and the workshops of [[Emile Gallé]] and the [[Daum (studio)|Daum]] studio, led by [[Auguste Daum|Auguste]] and Antonin Daum, were located there. They worked with many notable designers, including [[Ernest Bussière]], [[Henri Bergé]], and [[Amalric Walter]]. They developed a new method of incrusting glass by pressing fragments of different color glass into the unfinished piece. They often collaborated with the furniture designer [[Louis Majorelle]], whose home and workshops were in Nancy. Another feature of Art Nouveau was the use of stained glass windows with that style of floral themes in residential salons, particularly in the Art Nouveau houses in Nancy. Many were the work of Jacques Gruber, who made windows for the [[Villa Majorelle]] and other houses.{{Sfn|Riley|2007|page=318}}

In Belgium, the leading firm was the glass factory of [[Val Saint Lambert]], which created vases in organic and floral forms, many of them designed by [[Philippe Wolfers]]. Wolfers was noted particularly for creating works of [[symbolist]] glass, often with metal decoration attached. In [[Bohemia]], then a region of the [[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian Empire]] noted for crystal manufacture, the companies [[Lobmeyr]] and [[Loetz-Witwe]] also experimented with new coloring techniques, producing more vivid and richer colors. In Germany, experimentation was led by Karl Köpping, who used blown glass to create extremely delicate glasses in the form of flowers; so delicate that few survive today.{{Sfn|Riley|2007|page=320}}

In Vienna, the glass designs of the Secession movement were much more geometrical than those of France or Belgium; [[Otto Prutscher]] was the most rigorous glass designer of the movement.{{Sfn|Riley|2007|page=320}}

In Britain, a number of floral stained glass designs were created by [[Margaret Macdonald Mackintosh]] for the architectural display called "The House of an Art Lover."

In the United States, [[Louis Comfort Tiffany]] and his designers became particularly famous for their lamps, whose glass shades used common floral themes intricately pieced together. Tiffany lamps gained popularity after the [[World's Columbian Exposition]] in Chicago in 1893, where Tiffany displayed his lamps in a Byzantine-like chapel. Tiffany experimented extensively with the processes of coloring glass, patenting in 1894 the process [[Favrile glass]], which used metallic oxides to color the interior of the molten glass, giving it an iridescent effect. His workshops produced several different series of the [[Tiffany lamp]] in different floral designs, along with stained glass windows, screens, vases and a range of decorative objects. His works were first imported to Germany, then to France by [[Siegfried Bing]], and then became one of the decorative sensations of the 1900 Exposition. An American rival to Tiffany, [[Steuben Glass]], was founded in 1903 in [[Corning (city), New York|Corning, NY]], by [[Frederick Carder]], who, like Tiffany, used the Fevrile process to create surfaces with iridescent colors. Another notable American glass artist was [[John La Farge]], who created intricate and colorful stained glass windows on both religious and purely decorative themes.{{Sfn|Riley|2007|page=320}}

The 19th-century architectural theorist [[Viollet-le-Duc]] had advocated showing, rather than concealing the iron frameworks of modern buildings, but Art Nouveau architects [[Victor Horta]] and [[Hector Guimard]] went a step further: they added iron decoration in curves inspired by floral and vegetal forms both in the interiors and exteriors of their buildings. They took the form of stairway railings in the interior, light fixtures, and other details in the interior, and balconies and other ornaments on the exterior. These became some of the most distinctive features of Art Nouveau architecture. The use of metal decoration in vegetal forms soon also appeared in silverware, lamps, and other decorative items.{{Sfn|Riley|2007|page=322}}

In the United States, the designer [[George Grant Elmslie]] made extremely intricate cast iron designs for the balustrades and other interior decoration of the buildings of Chicago architect [[Louis Sullivan]].

While French and American designers used floral and vegetal forms, [[Joseph Maria Olbrich]] and the other Secession artists designed teapots and other metal objects in a more geometric and sober style.{{Sfn|Riley|2007|page=324}}

Art Nouveau is characterized done by soft, curved shapes and lines, and usually features natural designs such as flowers, birds and other animals. The female body is a popular theme and is featured on a variety of jewelry pieces, especially cameos. It frequently included long necklaces made of pearls or sterling-silver chains punctuated by glass beads or ending in a silver or gold pendant, itself often designed as an ornament to hold a single, faceted jewel of [[amethyst]], [[peridot]], or [[citrine quartz|citrine]].&lt;ref name="Art Nouveau Jewelry"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.collectorsweekly.com/fine-jewelry/art-nouveau|title=Art Nouveau Jewelry|accessdate=2016-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Art Nouveau period brought a notable stylistic revolution to the jewelry industry, led largely by the major firms in Paris. For the previous two centuries, the emphasis in fine jewelry had been creating dramatic settings for diamonds. During the reign of Art Nouveau, diamonds usually played a supporting role. Jewelers experimented with a wide variety of other stones, including [[agate]], [[garnet]] [[opal]], [[moonstone (gemstone)|moonstone]], [[Beryl#Aquamarine and maxixe|aquamarine]] and other semi-precious stones, and with a wide variety of new techniques, among others [[vitreous enamel|enameling]], and new materials, including [[horn (anatomy)|horn]], molded glass, and [[ivory]].

Early notable Paris jewelers in the Art Nouveau style included [[Louis Aucoc]], whose family jewelry firm dated to 1821. The most famous designer of the Art Nouveau period, [[René Lalique]], served his apprenticeship in the Aucoc studio from 1874 to 1876. Lalique became a central figure of Art Nouveau jewelry and glass, using nature, from [[dragonfly|dragonflies]] to grasses, as his model. Artists from outside of the traditional world of jewellery, such as [[Paul Follot]], best known as a furniture designer, experimented with jewellery designs. Other notable French Art Nouveau jewellery designers included [[Jules Brateau]] and Georges Henry. In the United States, the most famous designer was [[Louis Comfort Tiffany]], whose work was shown at the shop of [[Siegfried Bing]] and also at the 1900 Paris Exposition.

In Britain, the most prominent figure was the Liberty &amp; Co. designer [[Archibald Knox (designer)|Archibald Knox]], who made a variety of Art Nouveau pieces, including silver belt buckles. [[C. R. Ashbee]] designed pendants in the shapes of peacocks. The versatile [[Glasgow]] designer [[Charles Rennie Mackintosh]] also made jewellery, using traditional Celtic symbols. In Germany, the center for ''Jugendstil'' jewelry was the city of [[Pforzheim]], where most of the German firms, including [[Theodor Fahrner]], were located. They quickly produced works to meet the demand for the new style.

&lt;/gallery&gt;
Art Nouveau architecture was a reaction against the eclectic styles which dominated European architecture in the second half of the 19th century. It was expressed through decoration. The buildings were covered with ornament in curving forms, based on flowers, plants or animals: butterflies, peacocks, swans, irises, cyclamens, orchids and water lilies. Façades were asymmetrical, and often decorated with polychrome ceramic tiles. The decoration usually suggested movement; there was no distinction between the structure and the ornament.&lt;ref&gt;Renault and Lazé, ''Les styles de l'architecture et du mobilier'' (2006), pp. 107-111&lt;/ref&gt;

The style first appeared in Brussels' [[Hôtel Tassel]] (1894) and [[Hôtel Solvay]] (1900) of [[Victor Horta]]. The Hôtel Tassel was visited by [[Hector Guimard]], who used the same style in his first major work, the [[Castel Béranger]] (1897–98). In all of these houses, the architects also designed the furniture and the interior decoration, down to the doorknobs and carpeting. In 1899, based on the fame of the Castel Béranger, Guimard received a commission to design the entrances of the stations of the new [[Paris Métro]], which opened in 1900. Though few of the originals survived, These became the symbol of the Art Nouveau movement in Paris.

In Paris, the architectural style was also a reaction to the strict regulations imposed on building facades by [[Georges-Eugène Haussmann]], the prefect of Paris under [[Napoleon III]]. [[Bow window]]s were finally allowed in 1903, and Art Nouveau architects went to the opposite extreme, most notably in the houses of [[Jules Lavirotte]], which were essentially large works of sculpture, completely covered with decoration. An important neighborhood of Art Nouveau houses appeared in the French city of [[Nancy, France|Nancy]], around the [[Villa Majorelle]] (1901–02), the residence of furniture designer [[Louis Majorelle]]. It was designed by [[Henri Sauvage]] as a showcase for Majorelle's furniture designs.&lt;ref&gt;Renault and Lazé, (2006), pp. 107-111&lt;/ref&gt;

Furniture design in the Art Nouveau period was closely associated with the architecture of the buildings;  the architects often designed the furniture, carpets, light fixtures, doorknobs, and other decorative details. The furniture was often complex and expensive; a fine finish, usually polished or varnished, was regarded as essential, and continental designs were usually very complex, with curving shapes that were expensive to make. It also had the drawback that the owner of the home could not change the furniture or add pieces in a different style without disrupting the entire effect of the room. For this reason, when Art Nouveau architecture went out of style, the style of furniture also largely disappeared.

In France, the center for furniture design and manufacture was in [[Nancy, France|Nancy]], where two major designers, [[Émile Gallé]] and [[Louis Majorelle]] had their studios and workshops, and where the ''Alliance des industries d'art'' (later called the School of Nancy) had been founded in 1901. Both designers based on their structure and ornamentation on forms taken from nature, including flowers and insects, such as the dragonfly, a popular motif in Art Nouveau design. Gallé was particularly known for his use of [[marquetry]] in relief, in the form of landscapes or poetic themes. Majorelle was known for his use of exotic and expensive woods, and for attaching bronze sculpted in vegetal themes to his pieces of furniture. Both designers used machines for the first phases of manufacture, but all the pieces were finished by hand. Other notable furniture designers of the Nancy School included [[Eugène Vallin]] and [[Émile André]]; both were architects by training, and both designed furniture that resembled the furniture from Belgian designers such as Horta and Van de Velde, which had less decoration and followed more closely the curving plants and flowers. Other notable French designers included [[Henri Bellery-Desfontaines]], who took his inspiration from the neo-Gothic styles of [[Eugène Viollet-le-Duc|Viollet-le-Duc]]; and [[Georges de Feure]], [[Eugène Gaillard]], and Édouard Colonna, who worked together with art dealer [[Siegfried Bing]] to revitalize the French furniture industry with new themes. Their work was known for "abstract naturalism", its unity of straight and curved lines, and its [[rococo]] influence. The furniture of de Feure at the Bing pavilion won a gold medal at the 1900 Paris Exposition. The most unusual and picturesque French designer was [[François-Rupert Carabin]], a sculptor by training, whose furniture featured sculpted nude female forms and symbolic animals, particularly cats, who combined Art Nouveau elements with [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolism]]. Other influential Paris furniture designers were [[Charles Plumet]], and [[Alexandre Charpentier]].{{sfn|Riley|2007|page=302}}  In many ways the old vocabulary and techniques of classic French 18th-century [[Rococo]] furniture were re-interpreted in a new style.&lt;ref name="Gontar, Cybele 2006" /&gt;

In Belgium, the pioneer architects of the ''Art Nouveau movement'', [[Victor Horta]] and [[Henry van de Velde]], designed furniture for their houses, using vigorous curving lines and a minimum of decoration.  The Belgian designer [[Gustave Serrurier-Bovy]] added more decoration, applying brass strips in curving forms. In the Netherlands, where the style was called ''Nieuwe Kunst'' or New Art, H.P. Berlag, Lion Cachet and Theodor Nieuwenhuis followed a different course, that of the English [[Arts and Crafts]] movement, with more geometric rational forms.

In Britain, the furniture of [[Charles Rennie Mackintosh]] was purely Arts and Crafts, austere and geometrical, with long straight lines and right angles and a minimum of decoration.&lt;ref name="Lucie-Smith, 160"&gt;Lucie-Smith, 160&lt;/ref&gt; Continental designs were much more elaborate, often using curved shapes both in the basic shapes of the piece, and in applied decorative motifs. In Germany, the furniture of [[Peter Behrens]] and the [[Jugendstil]] was largely rationalist, with geometric straight lines and some decoration attached to the surface. Their goal was exactly the opposite of French Art Nouveau; simplicity of structure and simplicity of materials, for furniture that could be inexpensive and easily mass-manufactured. The same was true for the furniture of designers of the [[Wiener Werkstätte]] in Vienna, led by [[Otto Wagner]], [[Josef Hoffmann]], Josef Maria Olbrich and [[Koloman Moser]]. The furniture was geometric and had a minimum of decoration, though in style it often followed national historic precedent, particularly the [[Biedemeier]] style.{{Sfn|RIley|2007|page=308}}
 
Italian and Spanish furniture design went off in their own direction. [[Carlo Bugatti]] in Italy designed the extraordinary Snail Chair, wood covered with painted parchment and copper, for the Turin International Exposition of 1902. In Spain, following the lead of [[Antoni Gaudi]] and the ''Modernismo'' movement, the furniture designer Gaspar Homar designed works that were inspired by natural forms with touches of Catalan historic styles.{{Sfn|Riley|2007|page=312}}

In the United States, furniture design was more often inspired by the Arts and Crafts movement, or by historic American models, than by the Art Nouveau. One designer who did introduce Art Nouveau themes was [[Charles Rohlfs]] in Buffalo, New York, whose designs for American white oak furniture were influenced by motifs of [[Celtic Art]] and [[Gothic art]], with touches of Art Nouveau in the metal trim applied to the pieces.{{Sfn|Riley|2007|page=312}}

The last part of the 19th century saw many technological innovation in the manufacture of ceramics, particularly the development of high temperature (''grand feu'') porcelain with crystallised and matte glazes. At the same time, several lost techniques, such as oxblood glaze, were rediscovered. Art Nouveau ceramics were also influenced by traditional and modern Japanese and Chinese ceramics, whose vegetal and floral motifs fitted well with the Art Nouveau style. In France, artists also rediscovered the traditional [[Stoneware|''grés'']] methods and reinvented them with new motifs. Ceramics also found an important new use in architecture: Art Nouveau architects, [[Jules Lavirotte]] and [[Hector Guimard]] among them, began to decorate the façades of buildings with ceramic tiles, many of them made by the firm of [[Alexandre Bigot]], giving them a distinct Art Nouveau sculptural look. In the Art Nouveau ceramics quickly moved into the domain of sculpture and architecture.{{Sfn|Riley|2007|pages=314-15}}

One of the pioneer French Art Nouveau ceramists was [[Ernest Chaplet]], whose career in ceramics spanned thirty years. He began producing stoneware influenced by Japanese and Chinese prototypes. Beginning in 1886, he worked with painter [[Paul Gauguin]] on stoneware designs with applied figures, multiple handles, painted and partially glazed, and collaborated with sculptors [[Félix Bracquemond]], [[Jules Dalou]] and [[Auguste Rodin]]. His works were acclaimed at the 1900 Exposition.

The major national ceramics firms had an important place at the 1900 Paris Exposition: the [[Manufacture nationale de Sèvres]] outside Paris; [[Nymphenburg]], [[Meissen]], [[Villeroy &amp; Boch]] in Germany, and [[Doulton Industrial Products|Doulton]] in Britain. Other leading French ceramists included [[Taxile Doat]], {{Interlanguage link multi|Pierre-Adrien Dalpayrat|fr}}, [[Edmond Lachenal]], {{Interlanguage link multi|Albert Dammouse|fr}} and [[Auguste Delaherche]].&lt;ref&gt;''Edmond Lachenal and His Legacy'', by Martin Eidelberg, Claire Cass, Hudson Hills Press; illustrated edition (25 February 2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

In France, Art Nouveau ceramics sometimes crossed the line into sculpture. The porcelain figurine ''Dancer with a Scarf'' by [[Agathon Léonard]], made for the [[Manufacture nationale de Sèvres]], won recognition in both categories at the 1900 Paris Exposition.

The [[Zsolnay|Zsolnay factory]] in [[Pécs]], [[Hungary]], was led by [[Miklós Zsolnay]] (1800–1880) and his son, [[Vilmos Zsolnay]] (1828–1900,) with [[Tádé Sikorski]] (1852–1940) chief designer, to produce stoneware and other ceramics in 1853. In 1893, Zsolnay introduced porcelain pieces made of [[eosin]]. He led the factory to worldwide recognition by demonstrating its innovative products at world fairs and international exhibitions, including the [[Weltausstellung 1873 Wien|1873 World Fair in Vienna]], then at the [[Exposition Universelle (1878)|1878 World Fair in Paris]], where Zsolnay received a ''Grand Prix''. Frost-resisting Zsolnay building decorations were used in numerous buildings, specifically during the Art Nouveau movement.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.magyarkeramia.hu/keramia/zsolnay/page_en.html Timeline], accessed 1/23/08&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;
Textiles and wallpapers were an important vehicle of Art Nouveau from the beginning of the style, and an essential element of Art Nouveau interior design. In Britain, the textile designs o[[William Morris]] had helped launch the [[Arts and Crafts Movement]] and then Art Nouveau. Many designs were created for the [[Liberty (department store)|Liberty department store]] in London, which popularized the style throughout Europe. One such designer was the [[Silver Studio]], which provided colorful stylized floral patterns. Other distinctive designs came from [[Glasgow School]], and [[Margaret Macdonald Mackintosh]]. The Glasgow school introduced several distinctive motifs, including stylized eggs, geometric forms and the "Rose of Glasgow".

In France, a major contribution was made by designer [[Eugène Grasset]] who in 1896 published ''La Plante et ses applications ornamentales'', suggesting Art Nouveau designs based on different flowers and plants. Many patterns were designed for and produced by for the major French textile manufacturers in Mulhouse, Lille and Lyon, by German and Belgian workshops. The German designer [[Hermann Obrist]]  specialized in floral patterns, particularly the cyclamen and the "whiplash" style based on flower stems, which became a major motif of the style. The Belgian [[Henry van de Velde]] presented a textile work, ''La Veillée d'Anges'', at the Salon ''La Libre Esthéthique'' in Brussels, inspired by the symbolism of [[Paul Gauguin]] and of the [[Nabis]]. In the Netherlands, textiles were often inspired by [[batik]] patterns from the Dutch colonies in the [[East Indies]]. Folk art also inspired the creation of tapestries, carpets, embroidery and textiles in Central Europe and Scandinavia, in the work of [[Gerhard Munthe]] and [[Frida Hansen]] in Norway. The ''Five Swans'' design of [[Otto Eckmann]] appeared in more than one hundred different versions. The Hungarian designer [[János Vaszary]] combined Art Nouveau elements with folkloric themes.{{Sfn|Riley|2007|page=328}}

The '''Baker Building''', also known as '''Baker's Opera House''', in [[Dover, New Jersey|Dover]], [[Morris County, New Jersey|Morris County]], [[New Jersey]], United States, is a historic theater built of brick in the mid-1880s. Built in the Eclectic style, it has three stories plus a tower.  On the north side facing Blackwell Street, there are recessed brick panels, granite lintels and window sills, and a granite panel reading "Baker Building."  A Mail Pouch Tobacco sign covers the south side of the building.&lt;ref name=DHS/&gt;

The "Opera House" was built by William Henry Baker as a [[vaudeville]] theater.  The grand opening was on April 5, 1886 with the Alfa Norman English Opera Company performing ''The Bobetuian Girl''. On April 6 the same company performed ''[[The Mikado]]''. Tickets cost $1.00 to $1.50. Later fare included other [[Gilbert and Sullivan]] comic operas, magic shows and [[minstrel show]]s featuring Arthur Deming.  In 1906 the theater was thoroughly reconstructed and started showing silent films along with vaudeville performances after it reopened on December 5, 1906.&lt;ref name=DHS/&gt;&lt;ref name="BT in D"&gt;{{cite web|title=Baker Theatre in Dover|url=http://cinematreasures.org/theaters/10217|publisher=Cinema Treasures|accessdate=October 18, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The renovation cost $75,000 and included many plaster ornaments and friezes. Movies started at 7 P.M. with five vaudeville acts started at 8 P.M. with both shows accompanied by a seven piece orchestra. After W. H. Baker died in 1910 his son Henry O. Baker took over the business closing it for another reconstruction and fireproofing in 1924.  It reopened with 1,600 seats on December 22, 1924. Stanley Fabian later took over the theater, which showed its first [[talking picture]], ''[[On Trial (1928 film)|On Trial]]'' on March 18, 1929.&lt;ref name="BT in D"/&gt;

Stars who have visited the theater or appeared on the stage include [[Al St. John]], [[Buster Keaton]], [[Pearl White]], [[DeWolf Hopper]], [[Helen Hayes]], [[Lillian Russell]], [[Ethel Barrymore]] and [[Abbott and Costello]].&lt;ref name="BT in D"/&gt;

The building was nearly demolished in 1977 before its purchase by the Morris County Trust for Historic Preservation. It was then listed on the New Jersey registry of historic sites and in 1981 on the [[National Register of Historic Places]].&lt;ref name=DHS&gt;{{cite web|title=A Tour of the Historic Dover Area |url=http://doverhistoricalsociety.com/library/pdfs/dovertour2011.pdf |publisher=Dover (New Jersey) Historical Society |accessdate=October 18, 2012 }}{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5289">The '''Beethoven Quartet Society''' was a [[music]]al society established in 1845 in [[London]], [[England]] dedicated to the [[String quartet]]s of [[Ludwig van Beethoven]].

The society was established by [[Thomas Massa Alsager]] (1779–1846). Its establishment was encouraged by Alsager's "Queen Square Select Society" and [[John Ella]]'s ''Musical Union''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first= Philip| last=Taylor|others= |title= Anton Rubinstein: A Life in Music|origyear= |month= |format= |accessdate= |edition= |series= |volume= |date=14 June 2007|publisher=Indiana University Press |location= |isbn= 9780253116758|oclc= |doi=  |pages=70}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Beethoven Quartet Society was based at the ''Beethoven Rooms'' at 76 [[Harley Street]], London. Concerts were given under the title "Honour to Beethoven", and included works by other composers. One of its express aims was to study the late quartets from [[Sheet music|score]]. After Alsager's death in 1846 [[France|French]] cellist [[Scipion Rousselot]] directed the society.&lt;ref name = "berlioz"&gt;Berlioz, ''Les Soirées de l’orchestre''&lt;/ref&gt; Violist [[Henry Hill (musician)|Henry Hill]] (1837–1856) undertook writing the programme notes.

The society were the first to present a performance of the complete cycle of the Beethoven string quartets, running from April 21, 1845 and June 16, 1845, with [[Camillo Sivori]], [[Prosper Sainton]], Henry Hill and Scipion Rousselot.

Other musicians, who played at the society's concerts, include [[Joseph Joachim]], [[Henryk Wieniawski]] (both as violinist and violist), [[Heinrich Wilhelm Ernst]], [[Alfredo Piatti]], [[Louis Ries]], [[William Sterndale Bennett]] and [[Ludwig Strauss]].

One particular line-up during the 1850s was noted by Joachim's biographer Andreas Moser with Joachim and Ernst playing the [[violin]], Wieniawski the [[viola]], and Piatti the [[cello]]. This, however, is highly unlikely since Wieniawski first visited England in 1859 and Ernst's last stay dates from 1858 or even 1856.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rowe|first1=Mark W.|title=Heinrich Wilhelm Ernst.

[[Hector Berlioz]] attended at least one of the society's concerts at the "New Beethoven Room" (at the building at 27 Queen Anne Street, where Berlioz lived) and this made enough of an impression to mention it in his book ''Evenings with the Orchestra''.&lt;ref name = "berlioz"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mahaim, ''The First Complete Beethoven Quartet Cycles, 1845-1851: Historical Notes on the London Quartett Society''&lt;/ref&gt;

The {{nihongo|'''Casio Loopy'''|ルーピー|Rūpī|lead=yes}}, subtitled ''My Seal Computer SV-100'', is a [[32-bit]] [[home video game console]]. Released exclusively in [[Video gaming in Japan|Japan]] in October 1995,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uk.playright.dk/raretitel.php?id=29220|title=Play:Right Rare &gt; Hardware &gt; Casio Loopy|accessdate=2008-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; it was unique in that the marketing for it was completely targeted to [[Women and video games|female gamers]].

The Loopy includes a built-in thermal color [[Computer printer|printer]] that can be used to create [[sticker]]s from game screenshots. An optional accessory, called {{nihongo|''Magical Shop''|マジカルショップ|Majikaru Shoppu}}, is a video capture device to obtain images from [[Videocassette recorder|VCRs]] and [[DVD player]]s. Users may add text to these images and make stickers. Including Magical Shop's own built-in software, the Loopy game library contains 11 titles. The Loopy features one controller port for use with a standard [[game controller]] or with a mouse (sold separately). Developer [[Kenji Terada]] worked on ''Loopy Town no Oheya ga Hoshii!''.

Casio dropped the support of the console in 1996, only one year after its release.

'''Cinéaste One''' is an arts and cultural organization based in [[Karachi]] formed for the purpose of establishing an infrastructure to encourage and promote short film making in [[Pakistan]]. It organizes workshops and seminars promoting film literacy and produces the [[Cinéaste One Student Film Festival]].

==History==
Cinéaste One film organization was formed in 2012 after [[Rumman Zia]]'s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tribune.com.pk/story/796177/getting-to-know-karachi-in-five-films/ |title=Cinéaste One's Rumman Zia at Karachi Conference |publisher=[[The Express Tribune]] |date=2014-11-24 |accessdate=2014-12-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dawn.com/news/1152317/role-of-audience-in-creative-process-discussed |title=Rumman Zia discusses art at the Herald Forum |publisher=[[Dawn (newspaper)|Dawn]] |date= |accessdate=2014-12-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; ‘Cinema 101’ workshops became a regular feature of [[Alliance Francaise]] de Karachi (AFK) cultural activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.danka.pk/?var_action=event_details&amp;event_id=17182 |title=Cinema 101}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Zia and AFK agreed to publicly showcase the films coming out of the workshop. Cinéaste One Student Film Festival (COSFF) was produced; highlighting selected short films from workshop participants. The first time filmmaker’s efforts were lauded and the affair was deemed a success.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.afkarachi.com/spip.php?article284&amp;decoupe_recherche=Cin%C3%A9aste%20One%20 |title=COSFF12 - Alliance française de Karachi |publisher=Afkarachi.com |date= |accessdate=2013-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://soundcloud.com/#cineasteone/cineaste-one-radio-coverage |title=COSFF12 radio coverage |publisher=SoundCloud |date= |accessdate=2013-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Zia decided to capitalize on the event’s success. With an eye on cultivating the film scene, a bigger event was launched the following year. Cinéaste One Student Film Festival 2013 (COSFF13) assimilated Karachi’s major film schools:[http://www.saampt.org/ SAAMPT], [[SZABIST]], [[Indus Valley School of Art and Architecture]], [[Iqra University]] and Cinema 101 workshops, on a single platform, supporting upcoming filmmakers and fashioning a film culture. A film-rating system was developed and an external jury composed of foreign and local artists and filmmakers were assembled.
An indie-rock band opened the event and COSFF13 marked a celebration rewarding the best coming out of Karachi’s film schools. .&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thenews.com.pk/Todays-News-4-169426-Cineaste-One-Student-Film-Festival-begins-tomorrow |title=COSFF13 press release |publisher=[[The News International]] |date=2013-04-05 |accessdate=2013-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://soundcloud.com/cineasteone/cosff-13-radio-coverage |title=COSFF13 radio coverage |date=2013-05-01 |accessdate=2013-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dawn.com/2013/04/08/kurrachee-wins-at-cineaste-one-student-film-festival/ |title=Kurrachee wins best film at COSFF13 |publisher=[[Dawn (newspaper)|Dawn]] |date= |accessdate=2013-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The next Cinéaste One Film Festival took place on Dec 20th 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.afkarachi.com/spip.php?article566 |title=COSFF14 - Alliance française de Karachi |publisher=Afkarachi.com |date= |accessdate=2013-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.magtheweekly.com/31jan%2D06feb2015/last_page4.asp |title=MAG interviews Cinéaste One's Rumman Zia |work=magtheweekly.com |date= |accessdate=2015-02-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Filmistan===
In 2015, Cinéaste One organized an art exposition titled Filmistan from April 18 - April 25.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.afkarachi.com/spip.php?article608 |title=Filmistan - Where did those days go ? - Alliance française de Karachi |publisher=Afkarachi.com |date= |accessdate=2015-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dawn.com/news/1176764/journey-of-films-the-bygone-days |title=Journey of films: the bygone days |publisher=[[Dawn (newspaper)|Dawn]] |date= |accessdate=2015-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fimistan featured a series of exhibitions showcasing Pakistani film posters, art and memorabilia from a bygone era.
Most of the memorabilia at the exhibition comes from the private collection of [[Guddu]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dawn.com/news/1171575/guddu-the-last-of-lollywood-aficionados |title=Guddu: The last of lollywood aficionados |publisher=[[Dawn (newspaper)|Dawn]] |date= |accessdate=2015-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Gimp color selector 03.gif|thumb|[[GIMP]] color picker.]]
A '''color picker''' (also '''color chooser''' or '''color tool'''), is a [[graphical user interface]] [[widget (GUI)|widget]], usually found within [[graphics software]] or online, used to select colors and sometimes to create [[color scheme]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Feisner and Reed 2014, Chapter 5: "Digital Color Media and Technology", Glossary: "Color picker"&lt;/ref&gt;

==Purpose==
A color picker is used to select and adjust color values. In [[graphic design]] and [[graphics software|image editing]], users typically choose colors via an interface with a visual representation of a color&amp;mdash;organized with quasi-perceptually-relevant [[hue]], [[lightness (color)|lightness]], and [[colorfulness|saturation]] dimensions ([[HSL and HSV|HLS]]) – instead of keying in [[alphanumeric]] text values. Because color appearance depends on comparison of neighboring colors (see [[color vision]]), many interfaces attempt to clarify the relationships between colors.

==Interface==
Color tools can vary in their interface. Some may use sliders, buttons, text boxes for color values, or [[direct manipulation interface|direct manipulation]]. Often a two dimensional square is used to create a range of color values (such as lightness and saturation) that can be clicked on or selected in some other manner. Drag and drop, color droppers, and various other forms of interfaces are commonly used as well.

Usually color values are also displayed numerically, so they can be precisely remembered and keyed-in later, such three values of 0-255 representing red, green, and blue, respectively.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1506">'''Cormac Mac Con Midhe''', a.k.a. '''Cormac mac Cearbhaill Mac Con Midhe''' (died 1627) was an early [[Modern Irish]] [[poet]].

[[Manuscript]] H.5.6, held at [[Trinity College, Dublin]], contains a [[poem]] of 24 [[stanza]]s apparently written by Mac Con Midhe for Toirealach Ó Néill of Sliocht Airt Óig of Tyrone and his wife, Sorcha. It survives in another copy of 188 lines in MS 1291 (formerly H.1.17), also in Trinity, both being made by Hugh O'Daly in the middle 18th century for a Dr. Sullivan. According to Ó Diobhlin (2000), "Because of the corruptness of the copy the poem has never been edited, nor have its contents been deciphered ... Toirealach was transplanted to Connacht, and then he disappears from history after the [[Jacobite rebellion]]."

'''''Diana Vreeland: The Eye Has to Travel''''' is a 2011 documentary about the life and career of [[Diana Vreeland]], a fashion legacy famous for her time at ''[[Harper’s Bazaar]]'' and ''[[Vogue (magazine)|Vogue]]''.  The film was directed and produced by Lisa Immordino Vreeland (Diana’s granddaughter-in-law), Bent-Jorgen Perlmutt, and Frédéric Tcheng. It premiered at the 2011 [[Venice International Film Festival]] and the [[Telluride Film Festival]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| title=About the Film|url=http://www.dianavreeland.com/page/posts/op/read/id/20 |accessdate=February 15, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has a total running time of 86 minutes, and can be seen with English, French, and Italian subtitles.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| title=Diana Vreeland: The Eye Has to Travel.| url=http://www.musicboxtheatre.com/features/diana-vreeland| accessdate=February 15, 2014| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140626022326/http://www.musicboxtheatre.com/features/diana-vreeland| archivedate=June 26, 2014| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Synopsis==
The film features recorded audio and filmed interviews of Vreeland, as well as interviews with colleagues, family, and friends of Vreeland. Beginning with an exploration of Vreeland’s childhood, the film offers a glimpse of fashionable Paris during the [[Belle Époque]], a time when Vreeland had access to exciting and influential friends of her parents, such as ballet dancer [[Sergei Diaghilev]]. She even claimed to have ridden with [[Buffalo Bill Cody]], though the documentary makes it clear that Vreeland would occasionally exaggerate for the sake of storytelling. 

The film then focuses on Diana’s move to New York City in the 1920s, where she was inspired by the dancing, jazz, and new fashions of the time, and her subsequent move to London with her husband, Reed Vreeland. Here she opened a lingerie shop, thus beginning her career in fashion. Shortly after moving back to New York when war broke out in Europe, Vreeland was asked to do a column in ''Harper’s Bazaar'' called “Why Don’t You…?”  She quickly became the magazine’s fashion editor and, as such, revolutionized fashion by doing such acts as popularizing the blue jean and the bikini.

Much of the documentary looks at Vreeland’s time at ''Vogue'', where she began working after nearly two-and-a-half decades at ''Harper’s Bazaar''.  Vreeland quickly became the editor-in-chief at ''Vogue'', making the magazine into a much-loved artistic publication. The documentary features several accounts from people who worked with Vreeland during this time, including models, photographers, and fellow editors, discussing Vreeland’s drive and her vision for the magazine.

The film ends with Vreeland’s time as a consultant for the Costume Institute of the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]], which she became after being asked to leave Vogue in 1971, and final recollections of Vreeland and her fashion legacy.

==Reception==
The film has received positive critical review.
John DeFore of ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' claims, “The vibrant, entertaining and of course stylish doc should enjoy a nice arthouse run before becoming an essential presence on the DVD shelves of fashionistas everywhere.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| title=About the Film|url=http://www.dianavreeland.com/page/posts/op/read/id/20 |accessdate=February 15, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Comstock 1832 title page.jpg|thumb|Heavy foxing on the title page of an 1832 textbook]]

'''Foxing''' is an age-related process of deterioration that causes spots and browning on old paper [[document]]s such as [[book]]s, [[postage stamp]]s and [[wikt:certificate|certificate]]s. The name may derive from the [[red fox|fox]]-like reddish-brown color of the stains,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.conservation-wiki.com/w/index.php?title=Foxing_(PCC)|title=Foxing (PCC) - Wiki|website=www.conservation-wiki.com|accessdate=1 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; or the rust chemical [[ferric oxide]] which may be involved.  Paper so affected is said to be "foxed".

Although unsightly and a negative factor in the value of the paper item for collectors, foxing does not affect the actual integrity of the paper.

Foxing also occurs in biological study skins or specimens, as an effect of chemical reactions or [[mold]] on [[melanin]].

Aside from foxing, other types of age-related paper deterioration include destruction of the [[lignin]] by sunlight and absorbed atmospheric pollution, typically causing the paper to go brown and crumble at the edges, and acid-related damage to cheap paper such as [[newsprint]], which is manufactured without neutralizing acidic contaminants.

== Causes of foxing ==
The causes of foxing are not well understood. One theory is that foxing is caused by a [[fungal]] growth on the [[paper]]. Another theory is that foxing is caused by the effect on certain [[paper]]s of the [[oxidation]] of [[iron]], [[copper]], or other substances in the [[Wood pulp|pulp]] or [[Cloth|rag]] from which the paper was made. It is possible that multiple factors are involved. High humidity may contribute to foxing.

== Repairing foxed documents ==

Foxed documents can be repaired, with greater or lesser success, using [[sodium borohydride]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://blog.bookstellyouwhy.com/bid/230209/how-to-prevent-and-reverse-foxing-in-rare-books|title=How to Prevent and Reverse Foxing in Rare Books|first=Kristin|last=Masters|publisher=|accessdate=1 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; or proprietary bleaches, dilute [[hydrogen peroxide]] or lasers. Each method risks side effects or damage to the paper or ink. 

Another method is to scan the image and process that image using a high-level [[image processing]] program. This can usually remove the effects of foxing while leaving text and images intact.

== In biological specimens ==
It is generally not advisable to repair study specimens, except perhaps for mechanical damage. [[Type specimen]]s should – if at all possible – not be altered in any way. If foxing affects the study value of a specimen (e.g. in [[bird]] or [[mammal]] skins or in [[insects]], where it might affect diagnostic coloration), this might rather be remarked on the specimen label. Color standards{{sfn|Smithe|1974}} can provide a means of documenting coloration before or in the early stages of foxing.

'''Hell, etc.''' was [[Marilyn Manson]]'s third [[art exhibition]], held in [[Athens]], [[Greece]]. The exhibition was opened to the public from April 28, 2010 until May 2, 2010. Manson's more recent artworks and newly revealed pieces, of the time, were displayed.

==Background==
The art exhibition was scheduled to run from April 21, 2010, until April 25, 2010, however due to the volcanic ash cloud was postponed to begin on April 28, 2010, and be open from that date until May 2, 2010. This was correctly reported by [http://new.e-go.gr/exodos/article.asp?catid=6472&amp;subid=2&amp;pubid=7812548 E-Go.Gr].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.providermodule.com/marilyn_manson_news.php?fn_mode=fullnews&amp;fn_id=94 E-Go.Gr update on Hell, etc. by Marilyn Manson. Art exhibition postponed due volcanic ash.]&lt;/ref&gt;

The exhibition was held at the Athenian Cultural Centre. The exhibition opened at 10:00 daily and was open until 22:00. Flash photography was prohibited inside the exhibition, as the watercolor paintings were extremely sensitive to the [[Flash (photography)|flash]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mansonwiki.com/wiki/Hell,_etc._(exhibition) Information of the Hell, etc. art exhibition.]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Holly Marie Combs''' (born December 3, 1973)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://movies.msn.com/celebrities/celebrity-biography/holly-marie-combs|title=Holly Marie Combs: Biography|publisher=MSN Movies|accessdate=July 16, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; is an American actress and television producer. She is known for her roles as Kimberly Brock in the [[CBS]] series ''[[Picket Fences]]'' (1992–1996), [[Piper Halliwell]] in [[The WB]] series ''[[Charmed]]'' (1998–2006) and [[Ella Montgomery]] in the [[Freeform (TV channel)|Freeform]] series ''[[Pretty Little Liars]]'' (2010–2017).

==Early life==
Combs was born in [[San Diego, California]] and has described herself as being of [[Irish people|Irish]] descent.&lt;ref name="cosmopolitan"&gt;{{cite news|title=Holly Charms Hollywood|url=http://charmed-net.de/en/webtv/show_article.asp?id=47|work=Cosmopolitan|date=December 2000|author=Kizis, Deanna|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080528234106/http://charmed-net.de/en/webtv/show_article.asp?id=47|archivedate=May 28, 2008|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Peeple:Holly Marie Combs"&gt;{{cite news|title=Holly Marie Combs Dishes on Life With Her Boys|url=http://celebritybabies.people.com/2008/09/17/holly-marie-com|work=People|date=September 17, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time of her birth, her mother, Lauralei Combs (née Berckhem), was 16 years old, and her father was 17.&lt;ref name="cosmopolitan"/&gt; Combs's biological parents married, but the two split up after two years,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.askmen.com/women/actress_150/176_holly_marie_combs.html |title=Profile: Holly Marie Combs|website= askmen.com|access-date= January 7, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; feeling they were too young to make a marriage work. 

While Combs was learning to walk, she fell and hit her head on a marble table, resulting in a noticeable 'split' at the top of her right eyebrow. She lived in many different homes with her mother, near the beach in San Diego, often having very little privacy, while her mother attempted to pursue an acting career.&lt;ref name=tv.com&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.tv.com/people/holly-marie-combs|title=People: Holly Marie Combs|website=tv.com|accessdate=September 15, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; When Combs was 7, she and her mother moved to [[New York City]] where she spent most of her growing years. Combs was 12 when her mother married her stepfather. In New York City, Combs attended Beekman Hill Elementary and then the [[Professional Children's School]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pcs-nyc.org/page.cfm?page=1302}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In an interview when she was in [[Sydney]], [[Australia]], for [[Supanova Expo]], she said that she was a certified [[scuba diver]] at 13.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://au.news.yahoo.com/thewest/video/watch/31914652/charmed-stars/?cmp=st&amp;cmp=st|title=Charmed stars|website=Yahoo!

When she was 14 years old, Combs landed her first major role in ''[[Sweet Hearts Dance]]'' (1988), a [[comedy drama]] film directed by [[Robert Greenwald]]. She played Debs Boon, the daughter of Wiley Boon (played by [[Don Johnson]]) and Sandra Boon (played by [[Susan Sarandon]]).&lt;ref name="yahoo!bio"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://movies.yahoo.com/person/holly-marie-combs/biography.html|title=Holly Marie Combs Biography|work=Yahoo!

Inc|accessdate=July 15, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her next major role was in [[Oliver Stone]]'s ''[[Born on the Fourth of July (film)|Born on the Fourth of July]]'' (1989), a film adaptation of the best selling [[autobiography]] of the [[Born on the Fourth of July|same name]] by [[Vietnam War]] veteran [[Ron Kovic]]. Combs portrayed Jenny in the film, which also starred [[Tom Cruise]].&lt;ref name="yahoo!bio"/&gt; Her other roles included Helena in the 1989 [[anthology film]] ''[[New York Stories]]'', and Kim Fields in [[Hal Hartley]]'s ''[[Simple Men]]'' (1992).&lt;ref name="yahoo!bio"/&gt; Also in 1992, Combs made an appearance in [[Temístocles López]]'s ''[[Chain of Desire]]'' as Diana, and in the [[slasher film]] ''[[Dr. Giggles]]'', in which she played Jennifer Campbell, the 19-year-old daughter of Tom Campbell (played by [[Cliff De Young]]) and girlfriend of Max Anderson (played by [[Glenn Quinn]]).

Combs's first major breakthrough as an actress came at the age of 18, in the [[CBS]] television series ''[[Picket Fences]]''.&lt;ref name="yahoo!bio"/&gt; She portrayed Kimberly Brock, the daughter of Sheriff Jimmy Brock (played by [[Tom Skerritt]]) and his first wife Lydia for the show's four seasons (1992–96).&lt;ref name="yahoo!bio"/&gt; Jimmy's second wife, Dr. Jill Brock (played by [[Kathy Baker]]), was  her stepmother.  Combs auditioned for the role in New York. The casting agent told her that she wasn't right for the part because she "didn't have a big enough heart." Combs retorted, "If you're looking for someone with a big heart, what the hell are you doing in New York?". She was later called back and offered the job.&lt;ref name="cosmopolitan"/&gt; Combs won a [[Young Artist Award]] for her performance on the show.&lt;ref name="PF" /&gt;&lt;ref name="PF2" /&gt; During 1996, Combs starred as Sophie DiMatteo in ''[[Sins of Silence]]'', a drama/horror [[television film]] directed by [[Sam Pillsbury]]. The following year, Combs portrayed real-life convicted murderer [[Diane Zamora]] in the television film ''[[Swearing Allegiance|Love's Deadly Triangle: The Texas Cadet Murder]]'', and appeared in the fact-based drama film ''[[Daughters (1997 TV film)|Daughters]]'' as Alex Morell, one of the two daughters of a murdered heiress.&lt;ref name="yahoo!bio"/&gt;

=== Later work: 1998–present ===
In 1998, Combs landed a lead role in [[The WB]] television series ''[[Charmed]]'', in which she portrayed [[Piper Halliwell]], the middle of three sisters who are [[witch]]es.&lt;ref name="yahoo!bio"/&gt; Following [[Shannen Doherty]]'s departure after [[Charmed (season 3)|season three]] (2000–01), Combs's character became the eldest sister for the remaining five seasons of the show.&lt;ref name="yahoo!bio"/&gt; Combs also became a producer for ''Charmed'' from [[Charmed (season 5)|season five]] onwards.&lt;ref name="imdb"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0158552/combined|title=Charmed&amp;nbsp;– Full Cast and Crew|publisher=IMDb.com|accessdate=June 21, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The series ended its eight-season run on May 21, 2006. In 2007 and 2008, [[AOL]] named Combs's character Piper the third greatest witch in television history.&lt;ref name="tv witch 07"/&gt;&lt;ref name="tv witch 08"/&gt; Combs was the only cast member to appear in every episode of the series, including the original unaired pilot.

During ''Charmed'', Combs made a cameo appearance in [[Steven Soderbergh]]'s ''[[Ocean's Eleven]]'' (2001), and starred opposite [[Charisma Carpenter]] in the [[romantic comedy]] film ''[[See Jane Date]]'' (2003), portraying the role of "a struggling actress whose career benefits from an affair with an A-list actor."&lt;ref name="yahoo!bio"/&gt; In 2007, she starred in the [[Lifetime (TV network)|Lifetime]] television film ''Point of Entry'' (also titled ''Panic Button'') as Kathy Alden, a wife and mother of a single child whose family moves to a "beautiful and supposedly secure gated community after she's the victim of a violent house break-in."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tvjots.com/panic-button-pipers-no-longer-charmed/|title=Panic Button: Piper's No Longer Charmed in Dull 'Suspense' Yarn|publisher=Tvjots.com|date=November 3, 2007|accessdate=July 16, 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120125041523/http://tvjots.com/panic-button-pipers-no-longer-charmed/|archivedate=January 25, 2012|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following year, Combs signed a contract with Lifetime to produce and star in a series ''[[Mistresses (U.S. TV series)|Mistresses]]'', based on the [[Mistresses (UK TV series)|British series of the same name]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tvguide.com/news/Charmed-Holly-Lifetimes-14813.aspx|title=Charmed Holly Is One of Lifetime's Mistresses|publisher=Tvguide.com|date=July 9, 2008|accessdate=July 15, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, that version of the show never made it to air. ([[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] later made a version featuring Combs's former ''Charmed'' co-star [[Alyssa Milano]].) In 2010, Combs was cast in the [[Freeform (TV channel)|Freeform]] series ''[[Pretty Little Liars]]'' as Ella Montgomery, the mother of one of the main characters, [[Aria Montgomery]] (played by [[Lucy Hale]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ausiello|first=Michael|url=http://insidetv.ew.com/2010/04/10/holly-marie-combs-pretty-little-liars/|title=Exclusive: Holly Marie Combs joins 'Pretty Little Liars'|work=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|publisher=[[Time Inc]]|date=April 10, 2010|accessdate=July 15, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Combs was a series regular for the first three seasons, but became credited as a special guest star from season four onwards.

In 1993, Combs married actor Bryan Travis Smith; they divorced in 1997.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Charmed star Holly Marie Combs files for divorce from second husband David Donoho|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-2060523/Charmed-star-Holly-Marie-Combs-files-divorce-second-husband-David-Donoho.html|work=People Magazine|date=November 11, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 14, 2004, she married her long-time boyfriend and the former ''Charmed'' key-grip David Donoho.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2448">'''Hymnology''' (from [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] ὕμνος ''hymnos'', "song of praise" and -λογία ''-logia'', "study of") is the [[scholar]]ly study of [[religious]] [[song]], or the [[hymn]], in its many aspects, with particular focus on [[choir|choral]] and [[Wiktionary:congregation|congregational]] song. It may be more or less clearly distinguished from ''[[Hymn|hymnody]]'', the creation and practice of such song. Hymnologists, such as [[Erik Routley]], may study the history and origins of hymns and of traditions of sung worship, the biographies of the women and men who have written hymns that have passed into choral or congregational use, the interrelationships between text and tune, the historical processes, both folk and redactional, that have changed hymn texts and [[hymn tune]]s over time, and the sociopolitical, theological and aesthetic arguments concerning various styles of sung worship.

Hymnology is sometimes more strictly construed, as in ''[[A Dictionary of Hymnology]]'',&lt;ref&gt;John Julian, ed., (1902/1985), ''A Dictionary of Hymnology'', Grand Rapids, MI:  Kregel.&lt;/ref&gt; edited by [[John D. Julian]], which concerns itself very largely with the history, textual changes, and translations of hymns, and with the biographies of [[hymnographer]]s, and very little with the [[Metre (poetry)|poetic metres]] of these hymns, or with the [[hymn tune]]s to which these are sung.

'''''I Spit on Your Grave III: Vengeance Is Mine''''' is a 2015 American [[Rape and revenge films|rape and revenge]] [[horror film]], directed by R.D. Braunstein from a screenplay by Daniel Gilboy. It is the third installment in the series. [[Sarah Butler]] reprises her role as [[Jennifer Hills]] from the 2010 film ''[[I Spit on Your Grave (2010 film)|I Spit on Your Grave]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://bloody-disgusting.com/exclusives/3337017/anchor-bay-acquires-spit-grave-vengeance-mine-exclusive/ |title=I Spit On Your Grave: Vengeance is Mine |accessdate=2015-10-18 |publisher= | work =Bloody Disgusting}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Plot==
The film follows the life of [[Jennifer Hills]], continuing her story from ''[[I Spit on Your Grave (2010 film)|I Spit on Your Grave]]''. After Jennifer survived her assault and exacted revenge on the men who raped her, she avoided conviction for her killing spree and settled in Los Angeles. She is no longer an aspiring writer and now devotes herself between working as an assault hotline operator and going to group counseling under the assumed name Angela Jitrenka. She is also periodically shown attending personal therapy for her ordeal. Jennifer's scarring experience has left her highly distrustful and defensive towards most men, including her colleague Matthew, who has a seemingly genuine interest in her.

While in group counseling, Jennifer develops a bond with one of the girls in the group, Marla, who also does not trust men. The duo began their own personal crusade, by exacting poetic justice for victims of sexual assault. However, just as Jennifer begins to enjoy life, Marla dies under mysterious circumstances and no one is found guilty of her death. She becomes acquainted with Detective McDylan, an investigator to Marla's death who, however, fails to bring justice for Marla nor closure for Jennifer. Distraught and enraged at how the law could not help Marla nor the rape victims in her support group, she decides to get revenge for them.

One by one, Jennifer stalks and lures the unpunished rapists to a private place to torture and kill them. Her first victim is Marla's estranged boyfriend and alleged murderer, soon followed by the stepfather of a teenage member of the group. After befriending Oscar, the only male member of the support group who lost his daughter to suicide after a sexual assault, Jennifer tracks down his daughter's rapist. The man manages to overpower her as she tries to attack him, until he is shot dead by the police, whose attention Jennifer had been drawing through her actions. The police take Jennifer in for questioning, revealing their knowledge of her real identity in an attempt to obtain a confession. However Oscar, who had grown sympathetic to Jennifer's cause, walks into the police station after slashing his own arms, and publicly admits to the murders before dying from his wounds.

No longer the prime suspect, Jennifer is released but stays under police watch as a person of interest. She has a nervous breakdown, becoming further disillusioned with society and no longer able to discern well-meaning men from sexual predators. Clad in a suggestive red dress in order to bait men, Jennifer leaves her home, evading the police watch. First she unsuccessfully attacks Matthew and scares him away, then she tries to lure a local thug who had been harassing her. As Jennifer is about to kill him, she is shot and arrested by McDylan, who had been trailing her the whole time.

It is now revealed Jennifer's personal therapy sessions were part of her mandatory treatment following a two-year sentence for attempted murder, lacking evidence of the murders she actually committed. After completing the final session before her release, Jennifer leaves the doctor's office and switches the "therapist" sign on the door to read "the rapist". She then imagines being attacked by two inmates, who she kills, before killing her therapist who had left the room to stop it, revealing that her fantasies of killing are not over. The film ends as she walks down the hallway smiling.

==Merger with Chicago Review Press==
In 1987, IPG was acquired by '''''[[Chicago Review Press]]''''' (CRP) an independent publisher founded at about the same time as IPG.

==Acquisition of other book distributors==
IPG acquired Paul &amp; Company, an 11-year-old distributor of university presses, in 2001. IPG now sells directly to universities.

In 2006, IPG acquired Trafalgar Square Publishing, founded in 1973, which is the distributor of more than 100 publishers from the UK, Australia, New Zealand, China, and Germany, representing more than 20,000 titles. Its roster includes [[HarperCollins]], [[Pan Macmillan]], and [[Penguin Random House]] from the UK and [[Allen and Unwin]] and Penguin Random House from Australia; these publisher's titles are not always issued in US editions.

In 2018, IPG acquired International Specialized Book Services (ISBS), an academic book distributor.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| title = IPG Acquires ISBS| work = PublishersWeekly.com| accessdate = 2018-07-08| url = https://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/by-topic/industry-news/industry-deals/article/76510-ipg-acquires-isbs.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2019, IPG acquired the book distributor, [[Midpoint Trade Books]]. Speaking to Publishers Weekly, IPG's CEO, Joe Matthews said that the publishing industry "is consolidating because distribution rewards scale, requires expensive technology, and demands high-level access to customers."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work=Publishers Weekly |title=IPG Acquires Midpoint Trade Books|first=Claire |last=Kirch |date=2018-09-04|url=https://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/by-topic/industry-news/industry-deals/article/77902-ipg-acquires-midpoint-trade-books.html

[[File:Antique Persian Kerman Rug.jpg|thumb|right|Antique Persian Kerman Rug]]
'''Kerman carpets''' (sometimes "Kirman") are one of the traditional classifications of [[Persian carpet]]s. Kerman is both a city and a province located in south central [[Iran]], though the term sometimes describes a type which may have been made elsewhere.
Kerman rugs are prized for a wide range of designs, a broad palette, use of natural dyes and fibers, great tensile strength and abrasion resistance, and expert color combinations. Typical manufacturing used an asymmetrical knot on cotton foundation, but rare examples include silk or part silk piles, or silk foundations with wool pile.

==Designs and motifs of the Kerman region==
Because of the tremendous demand for rugs produced in Kerman and the complex demographics of this demand, a surprising variety of styles and designs were produced. Some Kerman rugs were woven explicitly for monied buyers from the West, some for local consumers with very different tastes.

Damask Rose is the most popular motif in Kerman rug designs, particularly in "Sabzikar Ravar" and "Gol Sorkhi" (Red Rose) rugs. 
Other well-known motifs are "Ghab Ghora'ani", "Setooni", "Ghabi", "Kheshti", "Saraam Atiyeh", "Jangali", "Shekargah" and "Lachak-Toranj". Kerman antique carpets often use the Toranj motif border of margins and narrow lines. Floral patterns woven into Kerman carpets in the 19th century are derived from the patterns of Kerman shawls, also made in Kerman at this time. 

A distinct variation of Kerman carpets is the Lavar or Ravar Kerman. These carpets were produced in Ravar village next to Kerman city in the northern region and are known particularly for their fine weave and elegant, classically derived design of allover and central medallion formats. Most Ravar or Lavar Kerman carpets include a signature, either that of the weaver or the person for whom the carpet was woven. 

[[File:Antique Persian Kerman Rug with Blue Field.jpg|thumb|right|Antique Persian Kerman Rug]]


Vase carpets, a type of Kerman rug distinctive of the 16th and 17th centuries, are characterized by an allover pattern of stylized flowers and oversized palmettes with vases placed throughout the field.

Kerman carpets of the 18th century and later very often use "lattice" patterns, with the central field divided by a lattice design giving many small compartments. A notable illustration is a carpet having belonged to [[William Morris]], now on display at the [[Victoria and Albert Museum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Carpet|work=V&amp;A|url=http://images.vam.ac.uk/item/O98834/carpet/|accessdate=January 2, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later all sorts of designs were made in Kerman, including large figurative ones. The [[Victoria and Albert Museum]] in London has a carpet of 1909 with a design copying a painting by the 18th century French artist [[Antoine Watteau]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://collections.vam.ac.uk/item/O75721/carpet/ V&amp;A Watteau Kirman carpet]&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Beattie|first=May H.|title=Carpets of Central Persia: With Special Reference to the Rugs of Kirman|isbn=978-0-905035-17-8|publisher =Al Tajir-World of Islam Trust|year=1976}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern Kerman rugs, made for western markets, are often woven in gentle and light colors such as amber, pink, and blue-gray. They may  employ western patterns, such as stripes and various repetitive motifs, as well as more traditional vase and garden themes, animal shapes, and pictorial designs. 

==Technique==

May Beattie has defined seven classes of Kerman carpets and identified a unique structure she called the "Vase technique" characterised by three shoots of [[weft]] between rows of knots.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Beattie|first=May H.|title=Carpets of Central Persia: With Special Reference to the Rugs of Kirman|isbn=978-0-905035-17-8|publisher =Al Tajir-World of Islam Trust|year=1976}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first and third are typically woolen and at high tension, while the second one, at low tension, is normally made of silk or cotton. [[Warp (weaving)|Warps]] are markedly displaced and the Persian knot is open to the left. This technique distinguishes Kerman carpets from both the Safavid (1501-1722) and subsequent (1722-1834) periods. Most Persian carpets, in contrast, used the "[[Turkish knot]]".&lt;ref name="m336"/&gt; 


The dye process for Kerman carpets took place while the wool was still in flock and before spinning, allowing for uniform color. The palette for Kerman carpets is as brilliant as it is varied. Tones can range from ivory, blue and magenta to a more golden and saffron cast.

==History==
[[File:Antique Persian Kerman Rug with Allover Pattern.jpg|thumb|left|Antique Persian Kerman Rug]]
Kerman has been a major center for the production of high quality carpets since at least the 15th century. 

By the 17th century Kerman's designers were at their most inventive and their weaving techniques of a sophistication not seen in other parts of the Persian empire. For instance, the weavers had learned to set their looms so that the cotton warps were on two different levels. They then threaded the wool wefts, leaving some tight and others sinuous, giving an immediately recognisable wavy finish to the surface of the carpet

In the 18th century some authors considered the carpets from the province, especially at Siftan, to be the finest of all Persian carpets,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Beawes|first1=Wyndham|last2=Savary des Brusions|first2=Jacques|title=Lex mercatoria redivida|page=644|publisher=James Williams |year=1773}}&lt;/ref&gt;  partly because of the high quality of the wool from the region,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Smith|first=John|year=1747|title=Chronicon rusticum-commerciale|page=462|publisher=T. Osborne}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Masson de Morvillier|first=Nicolas|year=1784|title=Encyclopédie méthodique: géographie moderne, vol 2|language=French|publisher=Panckouke|page=127}}&lt;/ref&gt; known as Carmania wool. 
[[Nader Shah]], [[Naser al-Din Shah Qajar|Naser al-Din Shah]] commissioned carpets from Kerman.&lt;ref&gt;Maktabi, 337&lt;/ref&gt; in the 18th century.

By the 19th century, the city of Kerman had a long history of urban workshops, very fine wool, master weavers and a reputation for the artistic superiority of its designs.&lt;ref name="m336"&gt;Maktabi, 336&lt;/ref&gt;

Starting in 1995, the KWA organised the annual Khmer Literature Festival.  It also staged competitions for novel and poetry writing, and gave out two awards:  the Preah Sihanouk Reach Award and the 7 January Award.

Lacking funds, the festival and awards did not continue after 2000.&lt;ref name="culturalprofiles.net"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.culturalprofiles.net/cambodia/units/182.html|title=Khmer Writers’ Association|date=24 July 2005|work=culturalprofiles.net|accessdate=16 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Khorāsānī style''' (Persian: ''sabk-i Khorāsānī'' 'the style of Khurāsān', also known as ''sabk-i Turkistānī'' 'the style of Turkistan', also transliterated ''Khurāsānī'') was a movement in Persian poetry associated with the court of the [[Ghaznavids]], associated with [[Greater Khorasan]] (now divided between Iran, Afghanistan, and Uzbekistan).

==History==

The term was coined in the early twentieth century.&lt;ref&gt;'Persian Poetry', in ''The Princeton Handbook of World Poetries'', ed. by Roland Greene and Stephen Cushman (Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 2017), p. 419.&lt;/ref&gt; It is traditionally considered to characterise the first period of [[New Persian]] poetry, running from the ninth century CE into the second half of the twelfth. It is characterized by its plain poetic technique, concrete images and metaphors, and some archaic linguistic features. While showing limited use of Arabic loan-words, poetry in this style was influenced by Arabic verse, particularly in terms of its prosody, and the dominant genre was the praise-poem.&lt;ref&gt;A. A. Seyed-Gohrab, ''Courtly Riddles: Enigmatic Embellishments in Early Persian Poetry'' (Leiden: Leiden University Press, 2010), p. 20; Angela Sadeghi Tehrani, 'Modernist Poetry in Iran and the Pioneers', ''Asian Journal of Multidisciplinary Studies'', 2.7 (July 2014), 167-69 (p. 167).&lt;/ref&gt;

The Khurāsānī period was succeeded by the ''[[sabk-i ‘Irāqī]]'' ('style of Iraq'), with its greater use of Arabisms, more elaborate metaphors and imagery, and turn towards spiritualism.&lt;ref&gt;A. A. Seyed-Gohrab, ''Courtly Riddles: Enigmatic Embellishments in Early Persian Poetry'' (Leiden: Leiden University Press, 2010), p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the transition between the periods was not a sharp one.&lt;ref&gt;Asghar Seyed-Gohrab, 'Stylistic Continuities in Classical Persian Poetry: Reflections on Manuchehri from Dāmghān and Amir Mo‘ezzi', in ''The Age of the Seljuqs, ed. by Edmund Herzig and Sarah Stewart, The Idea of Iran, 6 (I. B. Tauris).&lt;/ref&gt; The style saw a return to popularity with the so-called literary revival (''bazgasht-e abadi'') of the eighteenth to twentieth centuries.&lt;ref&gt;Angela Sadeghi Tehrani, 'Modernist Poetry in Iran and the Pioneers', ''Asian Journal of Multidisciplinary Studies'', 2.7 (July 2014), 167-69 (p. 168).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Exponents==

The pre-eminent study of the style was by Muḥammad Jaʻfar Maḥjūb in 1971.&lt;ref&gt;''Sabk-i Khurāsānī dar shiʻr-i Fārsī : barrasī-i mukhtaṣṣāt-i sabkī-i shiʻr-i Fārsī az āghāz-i ẓuhūr tā pāyān-i qarn-i panjum hijrī'' [The Khorasani style in Persian poetry: studies of the stylistic character of Persian poetry from its origins to the end of the fifth century of the Hegira] ([Tihrān]: Intishārāt-i Firdaws, 199-? [first publ. 1971]).&lt;/ref&gt; The chief representatives of this lyricism are [[Asjadi]], [[Farrukhi Sistani]], [[Unsuri]], and [[Manuchihri|Manuchehri]]. Panegyric masters such as [[Rudaki]] were known for their love of nature, their verse abounding with evocative descriptions.

==Example==

A. A. Seyed-Gohrab contrasts the following passages to illustrate the Khorāsānī style.&lt;ref&gt;A. A. Seyed-Gohrab, ''Courtly Riddles: Enigmatic Embellishments in Early Persian Poetry'' (Leiden: Leiden University Press, 2010), pp. 39-42, drawing on Julie Scott Meisami, 'Palaces and Paradises: Palace Description in Medieval Persian Poetry', in ''Islamic Art and Literature'', ed. by O. Grabar and C. Robinson (Princeton, 2001), pp. 21-54.&lt;/ref&gt; The first is a description of a palace from ''Qaṣīda 31'' by Farrukhī Sistānī, writing in the earlier eleventh century. It is plain and concrete in its description:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
: There was a kingly palace in the middle of the garden
: The top of the parapets was situated between two turrets
: Within the palace, there were decorated porticoes
: Each opening towards a belvedere
: One was adorned like Chinese brocade
: The other contained pictures as in Mani's ''Artang''
: In this palace, the images of the King of the East
: Were carved/painted in several places:
: In one place, he is fighting, holding in his hand a small javelin
: In another place, he is feasting, holding in his hand a cup of wine.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The second is from the end of the ''sabk-i Khurāsānī'' period, near to the ''sabk-i ‘Irāqī'' period: a description of a palace built by [[Arslan-Shah of Ghazna|Arslān Shah of Ghazna]], composed by [[‘Uthmān Mukhtārī]] in the vicinity of 1100. This description is far less concrete and much more spiritual in tone:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
: The ancient sphere established the centre of the world's empire
: Through this place, through which Jupiter exercises its heavenly influence.
: When the sun saw its parapets from the sky,
: It bowed its head to the ground, and its eyes to the threshold.
: [When] the virgins of paradise beheld it from their gardens,
: They took this palace for gold, and paradise as the mine.
: They considered the earth insignificant because of its firm structure;
: The air in this palace was so fine that the air (outside) was heavy.
: The architect used his intellect and soul to design this edifice
: Through the firmness of his intellect and the grace of his soul.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[File:Lombardic capitals Ambraser Heldenbuch folio 75v.jpg|thumb|Lombardic capitals in a manuscript (the Ambraser Heldenbuch, fol. 75v, c.1516)]]
'''Lombardic capitals''' is the name given to a type of decorative [[Letter case|upper-case]] letters used in inscriptions and, typically, at the start of a section of text in medieval manuscripts.&lt;ref name="Harris"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Harris|first1=David|title=The Art of Calligraphy: a practical guide to the skills and techniques|date=1995|publisher=Dorling Kindersley|location=London [u.a.]|isbn=9780751301496|pages=62–4|edition= 1st American}}&lt;/ref&gt; Paul Shaw describes it as a 'relative' of uncial writing.&lt;ref name="Black Letter Primer"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Shaw|first1=Paul|title=Black Letter Primer: an introduction to Gothic alphabets|date=1982|publisher=Taplinger Pub. Co.|location=New York|isbn=9780800808105|pages=52|edition= Rev.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Jenson De viris illustribus.jpg|thumb|Lombardic capitals in an early printed book ([[Cicero]]'s ''De viris illustribus'', [[Nicolas Jenson]] c.1470)]]
The term ''Lombardic'' comes from the study of [[Incunable|incunabula]].&lt;ref name="Schneider"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Schneider|first1=Karin|title=Paläographie und Handschriftenkunde für Germanisten. Eine Einführung|date=2014|location=Berlin, Boston|isbn=978-3-11-033704-4|edition= 3rd|page=155}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:ParticolareCampanileSantaChiara.jpg|thumb|Inscription in Lombardic Capitals on the campanile of [[Santa Chiara, Naples]]]]
[[File:Lombardic Caps metal type.jpg|thumb|Goudy's Lombardic Capitals, metal type]]
A characteristic form of text decoration in manuscripts and early printed books with hand colouring was to use alternating red and blue Lombardic capitals for the start of each successive paragraph.&lt;ref name="Schneider" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hellinga|first1=Lotte|title=Incunabula in Transit: People and Trade|date=2018|publisher=Brill|location=Leiden, Boston|isbn=978-90-04-34036-7|pages=183–184|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=CMZKDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA183|accessdate=27 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Unlike [[Historiated initial|historiated]] or [[inhabited initial]]s, Lombardic capitals are devoid of further decoration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Schneider|editor1-first=Ulrich Johannes|title=Textkünste. Buchrevolution um 1500.|date=2016|publisher=Wissenschafliche Buchgesellschaft|location=Darmstadt|isbn=978-3-8053-5100-3|page=219|edition= 2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In modern times, fonts of Lombardic capitals have been designed by many [[typographers]], such as [[Frederic Goudy]], who included a set as an alternative uppercase for his Goudy Text font.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Goudy Text Lombardic Capitals|url=https://catalog.monotype.com/font/monotype/goudy-text/lombardic-capitals|publisher=Monotype|accessdate=27 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|text=First, Lombardic, or the national hand of Italy, which was a development of the uncial and was first used in northern Italy. The Lombardic character is a most useful and interesting form and presents less of the fixed quality of the Roman. There are many and wide variations of it as developed by the scribes in different countries. It was the favorite form selected for initials and versals in manuscripts, which were usually painted in, in colors and gold, the solidity of the bodystrokes making it especially adaptable for this purpose. At its best this Lombardic letter preserves much of the feeling of the uncials of the sixth and seventh centuries.

'''Ludmila Zeman''' (born 23 April 1947) is a [[Czech Canadians|Czech–Canadian]] artist, animator, and creator of [[children's book]]s. She is the daughter of filmmaker [[Karel Zeman]].&lt;ref name="library"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.collectionscanada.gc.ca/read-up-on-it/015020-6061-e.html |title=Archived Content: Ludmila Zeman |publisher=[[Library and Archives Canada]] |date=2002-09-25&lt;!--date modified--&gt; |accessdate=2013-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="embassy"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.canadainternational.gc.ca/japan-japon/events-evenements/gallery-20110525-galerie.aspx?view=d |title=Children's Story Books and Animations by Ludmila Zeman: June 14 – July 22, 2011: Embassy of Canada Prince Takamado Gallery |publisher=[[Government of Canada]] (canadainternational.gc.ca) |date=2012-06-04&lt;!--date modified--&gt; |accessdate=2013-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="tundra"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tundrabooks.com/authors/Zeman_l.html |title=Tundra Books Online: Ludmila Zeman|publisher=[[Tundra Books]] (tundrabooks.com) |date=|accessdate=2013-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Zeman was born in the Moravian Czech city of [[Zlín]] (renamed Gottwaldov in 1949, through 1989).&lt;ref name=library/&gt;&lt;!-- ref source gives Gottwaldov; source for explanation is our linked article --&gt; She graduated from the college of art (Střední uměleckoprůmyslová škola) in [[Uherské Hradiště]].&lt;ref name=Storymakers&gt;{{cite book |author=[[Canadian Children's Book Centre]] |title=The Storymakers: Illustrating Children's Books: 72 Artists and Illustrators Talk About Their Work|location=Markham, Ontario|publisher=Pembroke Publishers|year=1999|pages=150–51 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6kkJ7RXwdqMC&amp;pg=PA150 |accessdate=2013-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; She worked as her father's assistant for his final films, and married Eugen Spálený, the chief animator at his studio. They had two children, Linda and Malvinia.&lt;ref name=Grutz/&gt; She launched a career in story books and animation for children.&lt;ref name="embassy"/&gt;

In 1983, Zeman and her husband were invited to teach [[film technique]] at [[Emily Carr University of Art and Design]] in Vancouver. When the couple attempted to emigrate, the Czechoslovakian communist government refused them permission, accusing them of pro-Western leanings. Zeman was told to leave the animation studio, and Spálený was drafted into menial construction work. In the summer of 1984, the family escaped through [[Yugoslavia]] to a refugee camp in [[Austria]], finally arriving in Canada to accept the teaching posts.&lt;ref name=Grutz/&gt;

''The Cedar Tree of Life'', a thirty-second animated segment the couple produced for the Canadian edition of ''[[Sesame Street]]'', attracted the attention of the [[National Film Board of Canada]], which invited the couple to make a short film on a topic of their choice.&lt;ref name=Grutz/&gt; Zeman's production was ''Lord of the Sky'', based on myths of the [[aboriginal peoples in Canada|Canadian north Pacific First Nations]]&lt;ref name="embassy"/&gt; and produced using [[cutout animation|paper cutouts]]. The film was a success, winning eleven international awards, including a blue ribbon at the [[American Film Festival]] in 1993; it was shown at the [[Sundance Film Festival]] the following year and was shortlisted for an [[Academy Award]] nomination.&lt;ref name=Grutz/&gt;

Following ''Lord of the Sky'', Zeman and Spálený planned a feature-length animated film based on the ''[[Epic of Gilgamesh]]''. Karel Zeman had introduced the epic, which was among his favorite books, to Ludmila when she was eleven.&lt;ref name=Grutz/&gt; The concept was eventually developed into a trilogy of children's books written and illustrated by Zeman: ''Gilgamesh the King'' (1991), ''The Revenge of Ishtar'' (1993), and ''The Last Quest of Gilgamesh'' (1995).&lt;ref name=Grutz&gt;{{cite journal |title=Zeman's Gilgamesh |last=Grutz|first=Jane Waldron |journal=[[Saudi Aramco World]] |date=May–June 1996|pages=18–26 |url=http://archive.aramcoworld.com/issue/199603/zeman.s.gilgamesh.htm |accessdate=2018-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; The final book in the trilogy won the [[1995 Governor General's Awards|1995 Governor General's Award for Children's Illustration]].&lt;ref name=gg&gt;{{cite web |title=1995 Winners|url=http://ggbooks.canadacouncil.ca/en/about-apropos/archives/1995/Winners.aspx |work=[[Governor General's Awards]] |publisher=[[Canada Council for the Arts]] (canadacouncil.ca) |accessdate=2013-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Embassy of Canada]] in Japan presented an exhibition of Ludmila Zeman's work in Tokyo in 2011.&lt;ref name="embassy"/&gt;

==Plot==
A wealthy, mild-mannered doctor, Miles Hawkins, is shot in the spine during a riot, leaving him paralyzed from the waist down.

After losing a lawsuit against a police officer he holds responsible, he uses his company's resources to invent a [[powered exoskeleton]] that not only enables him to walk but gives him superhuman abilities in the process.

Using a vast array of technology, including a large underwater lab and a [[hovercraft]] called the ''Crysalid'' to fly around the city, he assumes the persona of the vigilante "M.A.N.T.I.S." (Mechanically Augmented Neuro Transmitter Interception System).

The pilot featured [[Gina Torres]] as pathologist Dr. Amy Ellis, [[Bobby Hosea]] as reporter Yuri Barnes, and [[Wendy Raquel Robinson]] and [[Chris M. Brown (actor)|Christopher M. Brown]] as a pair of African students studying under Hawkins.

In the series, the supporting cast was changed to John Stonebrake, Taylor Savage and Lt. Maxwell, with the plot being completely rebooted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= 'M.A.N.T.I.S.'

The bulk of the series' run depicted the M.A.N.T.I.S. operating in a vigilante role, frequently pursued by police, and battling industrialist Solomon Box ([[Brion James]] / [[Andrew Robinson (actor)|Andrew J. Robinson]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= TV REVIEWS : 'Mantis' a Super-Hero Without a Prayer |publisher= [[The Los Angeles Times]]|date=1994-01-24|url= http://articles.latimes.com/1994-01-24/entertainment/ca-14729_1_mantis-ii|accessdate=2011-01-14|first=Howard|last=Rosenberg}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the series' final installment, Miles Hawkins and Lt. Maxwell are killed disposing of an invisible prehistoric dinosaur.  John Stonebrake seals off the records and technology that had created the M.A.N.T.I.S., thus averting an apocalyptic future.  While the title character's death was given a sense of finality, the story was left open in one respect: when Miles Hawkins returned to 1994 from the year 2026 (a 32-year difference), he did so precisely 32 seconds after his vehicle sent him forward in time, thus altering the computer-controlled future that his disappearance had led to. As such, Miles Hawkins, while dying in the reality that he returned to, was also sent forward in time to an unknown future, leaving his actual fate ambiguous.

==Production==
The series was produced in [[Vancouver]], [[British Columbia]], Canada. Many Vancouver landmarks, such as the dome of Science World, appear. It took three years to film due to Carl Lumbly being busy filming ''[[Nightjohn (film)|Nightjohn]]''. There were a number of differences between the pilot and the series. For example, in the pilot, Hawkins wore a suit over the exo-skeleton, it lacked a skullcap, and the headpiece was larger. The setting was changed from Oceania City to Port Columbia, and all of the characters, with Hawkins being an exception, were changed.

Poor ratings led to an extensive retooling of the concept.  Midway through the show's run, minor characters were jettisoned, and more fantasy adventure elements were incorporated into the premise, including [[Parallel universe (fiction)|parallel universes]], [[time travel]], super-villains, and monsters.  In one particular episode, the M.A.N.T.I.S. is accidentally thrown 32 years into the future, where he finds that his own technology has been exploited to create a supercomputer that is being used to enslave the Port Columbia population.  He destroys it and sets the human population free before returning to his own time.

Some, akin to [[attorney–client privilege]], offer [[Bank secrecy|banker–client privilege]].]]
A '''non-disclosure agreement''' ('''NDA'''), also known as a '''confidentiality agreement''' ('''CA'''), '''confidential disclosure agreement''' ('''CDA'''), '''proprietary information agreement''' ('''PIA''') or '''secrecy agreement''' ('''SA'''), is a [[law|legal]] [[contract]] between at least two [[party (law)|parties]] that outlines confidential material, knowledge, or information that the parties wish to share with one another for certain purposes, but wish to restrict access to or by third parties. The most common forms of these are in [[Physician–patient privilege|doctor–patient confidentiality]] (physician–patient privilege), [[attorney–client privilege]], [[priest–penitent privilege]], and [[Bank secrecy|bank–client confidentiality]] agreements.  

It is a contract through which the parties agree not to disclose information covered by the agreement. An NDA creates a confidential relationship between the parties to protect any type of confidential and proprietary information or [[trade secret]]s. As such, an NDA protects non-public business information. Like all contracts, they cannot be enforced if the [[Illegal agreement|contracted activities are felonies]]. NDAs are commonly signed when two companies, individuals, or other entities (such as partnerships, societies, etc.) are considering doing business and need to understand the processes used in each other's business for the purpose of evaluating the potential business relationship. NDAs can be "mutual", meaning both parties are restricted in their use of the materials provided, or they can restrict the use of material by a single party. It is also possible for an employee to sign an NDA or NDA-like agreement with an employer. In fact, some employment agreements will include a clause restricting employees' use and dissemination of company-owned confidential information. In legal disputes resolved by [[Settlement (litigation)|settlement]], the parties often sign a confidentiality agreement relating to the terms of the settlement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Confidentiality and Non-Disclosure Clauses in Commercial Contracts – Is it worth the Effort? |date=March 17, 2016 |author=Henry Pharr III |publisher=Real Estate Drill Down |url=https://realestatedrilldown.com/2016/03/17/confidentiality-and-non-disclosure-clauses-in-commercial-contracts-is-it-worth-the-effort/ |quote=[M]ost landlords and tenants are united in interest in not wanting the terms of their settlement publicized in a public forum where they may be misunderstood or misinterpreted as being weak, scared or simply not feeling strongly about their business and their actions.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Joe Davies |year=2014 |title=Confidentiality Provisions in Settlement Agreements |publisher=Vann Attorneys |quote=If you've ever signed a settlement agreement resolving some dispute, chances are pretty good it contained a confidentiality provision.

== General types ==
A non-disclosure agreement (NDA) may be classified as unilateral, bilateral, or multilateral:

=== Unilateral ===
A unilateral NDA (sometimes  referred to as a one-way NDA) involves two parties where only one party (i.e., the disclosing party) anticipates disclosing certain information to the other party (i.e., the receiving party) and requires that the information be protected from further disclosure for some reason (e.g., maintaining the secrecy necessary to satisfy patent laws&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web 
 |url=http://www.tms.org/pubs/journals/JOM/matters/matters-9405.html
 | title=Understanding Confidentiality Agreements
 | first=David V.
 | last=Radack
 | year=1994
 | work=JOM
 | publisher=[[The Minerals, Metals &amp; Materials Society]]
 | quote=Second, the use of confidentiality agreements can prevent the forfeiture of valuable patent rights
}}&lt;/ref&gt; or legal protection for trade secrets, limiting disclosure of information prior to issuing a press release for a major announcement, or simply ensuring that a receiving party does not use or disclose information without compensating the disclosing party).

=== Bilateral ===
A bilateral NDA (sometimes referred to as a mutual NDA or a two-way NDA) involves two parties where both parties anticipate disclosing information to one another that each intends to protect from further disclosure. This type of NDA is common when businesses are considering some kind of joint venture or merger.

When presented with a unilateral NDA, some parties may insist upon a bilateral NDA, even though they anticipate that only one of the parties will disclose information under the NDA. This approach is intended to incentivize the drafter to make the provisions in the NDA more "fair and balanced" by introducing the possibility that a receiving party could later become a disclosing party or vice versa, which is not an entirely uncommon occurrence.

=== Multilateral ===
A multilateral NDA involves three or more parties where at least one of the parties anticipates disclosing information to the other parties and requires that the information be protected from further disclosure. This type of NDA eliminates the need for separate unilateral or bilateral NDAs between only two parties. E.g., a single multiparty NDA entered into by three parties who each intend to disclose information to the other two parties could be used in place of three separate bilateral NDAs between the first and second parties, second and third parties, and third and first parties.

A multilateral NDA can be advantageous because the parties involved review, execute, and implement just one agreement. However, this advantage can be offset by more complex negotiations that may be required for the parties involved to reach a unanimous consensus on a multilateral agreement.

== Content ==
A non-disclosure agreement can protect any type of information that is not generally known. However, nondisclosure agreements may also contain clauses that will protect the person receiving the information so that if they lawfully obtained the information through other sources they would not be obligated to keep the information secret.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://smallbusiness.yahoo.com/r-article-a-57763-m-4-sc-25-intellectual_property_using_confidentiality_agreements-i |title=Intellectual Property: Using Confidentiality Agreements |publisher=Yahoo! Small Business |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090323220129/http://smallbusiness.yahoo.com/r-article-a-57763-m-4-sc-25-intellectual_property_using_confidentiality_agreements-i |archivedate=23 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, the nondisclosure agreement typically only requires the receiving party to maintain information in confidence when that information has been directly supplied by the disclosing party. However, it is sometimes easier to get a receiving party to sign a simple agreement that is shorter, less complex and does not contain safety provisions protecting the receiver.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}

Some common issues addressed in an NDA include:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* outlining the parties to the agreement;
* the definition of what is confidential, i.e. the information to be held confidential. Modern NDAs will typically include a [[wikt:laundry list|laundry list]] of types of items which are covered, including unpublished [[patent application]]s, know-how, schema, [[finance|financial]] information, verbal representations, customer lists, vendor lists, business practices/strategies, etc.;
* the disclosure period – information not disclosed during the disclosure period (e.g., one year after the date of the NDA) is not deemed confidential;
* the exclusions from what must be kept confidential. Typically, the restrictions on the disclosure or use of the confidential data will be invalid if
** the recipient had prior knowledge of the materials;
** the recipient gained subsequent knowledge of the materials from another source;
** the materials are generally available to the public; or
** the materials are subject to a [[subpoena]] – although many practitioners regard that fact as a category of permissible disclosure, not as a categorical exclusion from confidentiality (because court-ordered secrecy provisions may apply even in case of a subpoena). In any case, a subpoena would more likely than not override a contract of any sort;
* provisions restricting the transfer of data in violation of laws governing export control and [[national security]];
* the term and conditions (in years) of the confidentiality, i.e. the time period of confidentiality;
* the term (in years) the agreement is binding;
* permission to obtain [[injunction|ex-parte injunctive relief]];
* description of the actions need to be done with the confidential materials upon agreement ending;
* the obligations of the recipient regarding the confidential information, typically including some version of obligations:
** to use the information only for enumerated purposes;
** to disclose it only to persons with a need to know the information for those purposes;
** to use appropriate efforts (not less than reasonable efforts) to keep the information secure. Reasonable efforts is often defined as a standard of care relating to confidential information that is no less rigorous than that which the recipient uses to keep its own similar information secure; and
** to ensure that anyone to whom the information is disclosed further abides by obligations restricting use, restricting disclosure, and ensuring security at least as protective as the agreement; and
* types of permissible disclosure – such as those required by [[law]] or [[court order]] (many NDAs require the receiving party to give the disclosing party prompt notice of any efforts to obtain such disclosure, and possibly to cooperate with any attempt by the disclosing party to seek judicial protection for the relevant confidential information).
* the law and [[jurisdiction]] governing the parties. The parties may choose exclusive jurisdiction of a court of a [[country]].

===Australia===
Deeds of confidentiality and fidelity (also referred to as deeds of confidentiality or confidentiality deeds) are commonly used in [[Australia]]. These documents generally serve the same purpose as and contain provisions similar to non-disclosure agreements (NDAs) used elsewhere. However, these documents are legally treated as [[deed]]s and are thus binding, unlike [[contract]]s, without [[consideration]].

===California===
In [[California]], (and some other states), there are some special circumstances relating to non-disclosure agreements and [[non-compete clause]]s.

The '''odor detection threshold''' is the lowest concentration of a certain [[odor]] compound that is perceivable by the human [[olfaction|sense of smell]]. The threshold of a chemical compound is determined in part by its [[Molecular geometry|shape]], [[Chemical polarity|polarity]], [[partial charge]]s, and [[molecular mass]]. The olfactory mechanisms responsible for a compound's different detection threshold is not well understood. As such, odor thresholds cannot be accurately predicted. Rather, they must be measured through extensive tests using human subjects in laboratory settings.

[[Optical isomer]]s can have different detection thresholds because their conformations may cause them to be less perceivable for the human nose. It is only in recent years that such compounds were separated on [[gas chromatograph]]s.

==Values==
* The [[odor threshold value|threshold value]] is the concentration an aroma or taste can be detected (air, water and fat).
* The [[odor recognition threshold|recognition threshold]] or [[arousal threshold]] of [[olfactory neurons]]  is the concentration at which you can identify an odor (air, water and fat).
* The [[odour activity value]] is the concentration divided by the threshold.
* The [[flavor impact]] is the value the rate of change in perception with concentration.
* The [[flavor contribution]] of an [[aroma component]] in a mixture to the total profile can be calculated from the total odor units and the number contributed by that aroma chemical.

===Odor detection value===
''Odor threshold value (OTV)'' (also ''aroma threshold value (ATV)'', ''Flavor threshold'') is defined as the most minimal [[concentration]] of a substance that can be detected by a [[human nose]]. Some substances can be detected when their concentration is only few [[milligram]]s per 1000 [[tonnes]], which is less than a [[Drop (unit)|drop]] in an [[Olympic swimming pool]]. Odor threshold value can be expressed as a concentration in water or concentration in air.

Two major types of flavor thresholds can be distinguished: the absolute and the difference threshold. The odor detection threshold and the odor recognition threshold are absolute thresholds; the first is the minimum concentration at which an odor can be detected without any requirements to identify or recognize the stimulus, while the second is the minimum concentration at which a stimulus can be identified or recognized.&lt;ref&gt;L.J. van Gemert (2003) Flavour thresholds&lt;/ref&gt;

The odor threshold value of an odorant is influenced by the medium.

Examples of substances with strong odors:

* (Z)-8-[[tetradecenal]] (OTV = 0.009 ppb in water)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Sabine|first=Widder|title=8-tetradecenal as fragrance and flavoring substance|url=https://www.google.com/patents/US7332468|work=Google Patents|accessdate=20 July 2017|author2=Symrise GmbH &amp; Co. KG}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* p-[[vinylguaiacol]] (OTV = 10 [[Parts per billion|ppb]])&lt;ref&gt;H.H. Baek, K.R. Cadwallader (1999) Contribution of Free and Glycosidically Bound Volatile Compounds to the Aroma of Muscadine Grape Juice
Journal of Food Science 64 (3), 441–444 {{doi|10.1111/j.1365-2621.1999.tb15059.x}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

==Variables==
Threshold in a food is dependent upon:
* The threshold of the aroma in air.
* Concentration in the food.
* Solubility in oil and water.
* Partition coefficient between the air and the food.
* The [[pH]] of the food. Some aroma compounds are affected by the pH: weak organic acids are protonated at low pH making them less soluble and hence more volatile.
* Number and functionality of odorant receptors in the observer's nose.

The concentration of an odor above a food is dependent on its solubility in that food and its [[vapor pressure]] and concentration in that food.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2315">'''Papua New Guinean art''' has a long rich diverse tradition. In particular, it is world-famous for carved wooden sculpture: masks, canoes and story-boards. Papua New Guinea also has a wide variety of clay, stone, bone, animal and natural die art. Many of the best collections of these are held in overseas museums.

Some of the artists regarded as being in the first wave of contemporary art in Papua New Guinea are: [[Mathias Kauage]] [[Order of the British Empire|OBE]] (born 1944), [[Timothy Akis]], [[Jakupa Ako]] and [[Joe Nalo]], all from the tough urban area of [[Port Moresby]].  Kauage won Australia's [[Blake Prize for Religious Art]], four of his works are in the [[Glasgow Museum of Modern Art]], and he had a solo show in 2005 at the Horniman Museum, "Kauage's Visions: Art from Papua New Guinea". Other noted Papua New Guinean visual artists include [[Larry Santana]], [[Martin Morububuna]] and [[Heso Kiwi]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.niuginiarts.com/artists/ Niugini Arts]&lt;/ref&gt;

The works shown below, in composite images, were done while the artists were visiting California but are traditional in content and medium.  See http://www.stanford.edu/~mjpeters/png/.

'''Photography and the Archive Research Centre''' ('''PARC''') is an organisation in [[London]] that commissions new research into [[photography]] and [[culture]], curates and produces exhibitions and publications, organises seminars, study days, symposia&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.timeout.com/london/things-to-do/the-big-conversation-martin-parr-and-grayson-perry The Big Conversation: Martin Parr and Grayson Perry ]", [[Time Out (magazine)]]. Accessed 7 July 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; and conferences, and supervises PhD students. It is a part of [[University of the Arts London]] (UAL), is based at UAL's [[London College of Communication]] at [[Elephant &amp; Castle]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = https://www.theguardian.com/durham-business-school/university-of-london1 | accessdate = 6 July 2014 | newspaper = [[The Guardian]] | title = Research to change the world}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was designated by UAL in 2003.

According to PARC's website its activities span the history and culture of photography, particularly post-war British photography, the documentation of war and conflict, the photography of fashion and style, the visualization of the counterculture and photographers as filmmakers.

==Details==
[[Val Williams]] is its director and [[Brigitte Lardinois]] its deputy director. The Centre has a core group of members including [[Tom Hunter (artist)|Tom Hunter]], Alistair O'Neill, [[Patrick Sutherland]], Wiebke Leister, Jennifer Good (née Pollard), David Moore, Paul Lowe, Corinne Silva, Paul Tebbs, Mark Ingham, Martina Caruso, Peter Cattrell, Monica Biaglioli, Anne Williams, [[Jananne Al-Ani]], [[Sophy Rickett]], Joanna Love and Sara Davidmann. Current staff are Corinne Silva (Research Fellow), Robin Christian (Projects Manager) and Melanie King (Research Administrator).

Many of PARC's activities are conducted in conjunction with other arts organisations and universities including [[University of Sunderland]], [[National Media Museum]] in Bradford, [[Library of Birmingham]], [[Canterbury Christ Church University]], Street Level Photoworks in Glasgow, [[Wolverhampton Art Gallery]], [[Ffotogallery]] in Cardiff, [[Imperial War Museum]] in London, [[Photoworks (agency)|Photoworks]] in Brighton, [[University of Western Ontario]] in Canada, Expressions of Humankind and Max Ström publishers in Stockholm, Sune Jonsson Archive in Umea, Tate Modern and [[University of Wales, Newport]].

Two of PARC's divisions are War and Conflict Research Hub and Photography and the Contemporary Imaginary Research Hub.

PARC publishes ''Fieldstudy'' twice yearly, both in print and online, covering projects from PARC's staff, members and students.

PARC and Bloomsbury co-host the journal ''Photography &amp; Culture'', co-edited by Kathy Kubicki, Thy Phu and Val Williams, published three times a year by Berg.&lt;ref&gt;"[https://www.facebook.com/home.php?sk=group_119212018141597 Journal of Photography &amp; Culture]", Journal of Photography &amp; Culture. Accessed 6 August 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

PARC leads the ''Directory of Photographic Collections in the UK'', a portal to UK institutions holding publicly accessible photographic collections.

==Collections held within the Photography and the Archive Research Centre==

PARC currently houses three collections within its archive, ‘Camerawork’, ‘Photography Exhibition Posters’ and ‘The John Wall archive of the Directory of British Photographic Collections in the UK’. 'Photography Exhibition Posters' is a collection of over 300 posters dating back to the 1970s that features examples of partnerships between designers and galleries. The ‘Camerawork’ collection includes papers and objects from the Half Moon Photography Workshop and Camerawork’s early years, publication and touring exhibition programme. ‘The John Wall archive of the Directory of British Photographic Collections in the UK’ includes correspondence, research papers and file cards of this 1970s project.

There are many '''religious views on euthanasia''', although many moral theologians are critical of the procedure.

== Buddhism ==
{{Main|Buddhism and euthanasia}}
There are many views among Buddhists on the issue of euthanasia, but many are critical of the procedure.

An important value of Buddhism teaching is compassion.  Compassion is used by some Buddhists as a justification for euthanasia because the person suffering is relieved of pain.&lt;ref name="Keown, Damien 2005"&gt;Keown, Damien. “End of life: the Buddhist View,” Lancet 366 (2005): 953. SocINDEX with full text, EBSCOhost.&lt;/ref&gt;  However, it is still immoral "to embark on any course of action whose aim is to destroy human life, irrespective of the quality of the individual's motive." &lt;ref&gt;Keown, Damien. “End of life: the Buddhist View,” Lancet 366 (2005): 954. SocINDEX with full text, EBSCOhost.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Theravada Buddhism]] a [[upasaka|lay person]] daily recites the simple formula: "I undertake the precept to abstain from destroying living beings."&lt;ref&gt;This is the first of the [[Five Precepts]].  It has various interpretations.&lt;/ref&gt;  For Buddhist monastics (''[[bhikkhu]]'') however the rules are more explicitly spelled out. For example, in the monastic code (''[[Patimokkha]]''), it states:
:"Should any bhikkhu intentionally deprive a human being of life, or search for an assassin for him, or praise the advantages of death, or incite him to die (thus): 'My good man, what use is this wretched, miserable life to you? Death would be better for you than life,' or with such an idea in mind, such a purpose in mind, should in various ways praise the advantages of death or incite him to die, he also is defeated and no longer in communion."&lt;ref name="Keown, Damien 2005"/&gt;
&lt;ref name=ThanissaroParajika&gt;[[Thanissaro Bhikkhu]] (1994). [http://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/authors/thanissaro/bmc1/ch04.html ''Buddhist Monastic Code I'': Chapter 4, Parajika] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090427071937/http://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/authors/thanissaro/bmc1/ch04.html |date=2009-04-27 }}.

==Christianity==

=== Catholicism ===
The [[Declaration on Euthanasia]] is the Church's official document on the topic of euthanasia, a statement that was issued by the [[Sacred Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith]] in 1980.&lt;ref name="vatican-euth"&gt;
{{cite web
|url = http://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/congregations/cfaith/documents/rc_con_cfaith_doc_19800505_euthanasia_en.html
|publisher = Sacred Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith
|title = Declaration on Euthanasia
|date = 5 May 1980}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Catholic teaching condemns euthanasia as a "crime against life" and a "crime against God".&lt;ref name="vatican-euth" /&gt; The teaching of the Catholic Church on euthanasia rests on several core principles of Catholic ethics, including the [[sanctity of life|sanctity of human life]], the [[dignity]] of the human person, concomitant [[human rights]], due [[Proportionality (law)|proportionality]] in [[Casuistry|casuistic]] remedies, the inevitability of death, and the importance of [[charity (virtue)|charity]].&lt;ref name="vatican-euth" /&gt; It has been argued that these are relatively recent positions,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/belief/2009/aug/27/religion-catholicism McDougall H, ''It's popularly believed that Catholics are anti-euthanasia. Do Catholics believe we don't have the freedom to do as we like?'' The Guardian 27 August 2009 ]&lt;/ref&gt; but whatever the position of individual Catholics, the Roman Catholic Church's viewpoint is unequivocal.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.usccb.org/beliefs-and-teachings/what-we-believe/catechism/catechism-of-the-catholic-church/ Catechism of the Catholic Church]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Protestantism ===
[[Protestant]] [[Christian denomination|denomination]]s vary widely on their approach to euthanasia and physician assisted death. Since the 1970s, [[Evangelicalism|Evangelical]] churches have worked with Roman Catholics on a sanctity of life approach, though some Evangelicals may be adopting a more exceptionless opposition. While [[liberal Protestant]] denominations have largely eschewed euthanasia, many individual advocates (such as [[Joseph Fletcher]]) and euthanasia society activists have been Protestant clergy and laity. As physician assisted dying has obtained greater legal support, some liberal Protestant denominations have offered religious arguments and support for limited forms of euthanasia. However, they are more lenient than the Roman Catholic Church

=== Christians in support of euthanasia ===
Groups claiming to speak for Christians rather than the official viewpoints of the Christian clergy have sprung up in a number of countries.&lt;ref&gt;In Australia: http://www.christiansforve.org.au/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hinduism==
{{see also|Prayopavesa}}
There are two Hindu points of view on euthanasia. By helping to end a painful life a person is performing a good deed and so fulfilling their moral obligations.Euthanasia may also be acceptable if it is used for selfless motives. On the other hand, by helping to end a life, even one filled with suffering, a person is disturbing the timing of the cycle of death and rebirth. This is a bad thing to do, and those involved in the euthanasia will take on the remaining karma of the patient
Death is a natural process, and will come in time.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

It is clearly stated in the Vedas that man has only two trustworthy friends in life, the first is called Vidya (knowledge), and the 2nd is called Mrityu (Death). The former is something that is beneficial and a requirement in life, and the latter is something that is inevitable sometimes even unexpected.  It is not the euthanasia that is the act of sin, but worldly attachment which causes euthanasia to be looked upon as an act of sin. Even a Sannyasin or Sannyasini if they decide to, are permitted to end his or her life with the hope of reaching [[moksha]] i.e. emancipation of the soul.

== Islam ==
Muslims are against euthanasia. They believe that all humans life is sacred because it is given by God, and that God chooses how long each person lives. Human beings should not interfere in this.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

  | nopp = true}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Jainism==
{{Main|Sallekhana}}
[[Jainism]] is based on the principle of non-violence (''[[Ahimsa in Jainism|ahinsa]]'') and is best known for it.{{sfn|Kakar|2014|p=175}} Jainism recommends voluntary death or ''sallekhana'' for both [[Jain monasticism|ascetics]] and [[Śrāvaka#Jainism|srāvaka]] (householders) at the end of their life.{{sfn|Jain|2011|p=102}} ''[[Sallekhana]]'' (also known as ''Santhara'', ''Samadhi-marana'') is made up of two words ''sal'' (meaning 'properly') and ''lekhana'', which means to thin out. Properly thinning out of the passions and the body is ''sallekhana.''{{sfn|Kakar|2014|p=174}} A person is allowed to fast unto death or take the vow of ''sallekhana'' only when certain requirements are fulfilled. It is not considered suicide as the person observing it, must be in a state of full consciousness.{{sfn|Kakar|2014|p=174}} When observing ''sallekhana'', one must not have the desire to live or desire to die. Practitioner shouldn't recollect the pleasures enjoyed or, long for the enjoyment of pleasures in the future.{{sfn|Jain|2011|p=111}} The process is still controversial in parts of India. Estimates for death by this means range from 100 to 240 a year.&lt;ref&gt;"Fasting to Death" in: Docker C, Five Last Acts – The Exit Path, 2013:428-432 (details benefits and difficulties)&lt;/ref&gt; Preventing santhara invites social ostracism.&lt;ref&gt;Colors of Truth Religion, Self and Emotions: Perspectives of Hinduism, Buddhism, Jainism, Zoroastrianism, Islam, Sikhism and Contemporary Psychology by Sonali Bhatt Marwaha, 2006:125.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Judaism ==
Like the trend among Protestants, [[Jewish medical ethics]] have become divided, partly on denominational lines, over euthanasia and [[End-of-life (medical treatment)|end of life treatment]] since the 1970s. Generally, [[Jewish]] thinkers oppose voluntary euthanasia, often vigorously,&lt;ref&gt;For example, [[J. David Bleich]], [[Eliezer Waldenberg]]&lt;/ref&gt; though there is some backing for voluntary passive euthanasia in limited circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;Such as the writings of [[Daniel Sinclair]], [[Moshe Tendler]], [[Shlomo Zalman Auerbach]], [[Moshe Feinstein]]&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, within the [[Conservative Judaism]] movement, there has been increasing support for passive euthanasia (PAD)&lt;ref&gt;See [[Elliot Dorff]] and, for earlier speculation, [[Byron Sherwin]].&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Reform Judaism]] [[responsa]], the preponderance of anti-euthanasia sentiment has shifted in recent years to increasing support for certain passive euthanasia options.{{Citation needed|date=May 2007}} Secular Judaism is a separate category with increasing support for euthanasia.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.shj.org/physician-assisted-death/&lt;/ref&gt; A popular sympathiser for euthanasia is Rabbi Miriam Jerris.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ifshj.net/id91.html&lt;/ref&gt;

A study performed in 2010 investigated elderly Jewish women who identified themselves as either Hasidic Orthodox, non-Hasidic Orthodox, or secularized Orthodox in their faith.  The study found that all of the Hasidic Orthodox responders disapproved of voluntary euthanasia whereas a majority of the secularized Orthodox responders approved of it.&lt;ref&gt;Baeke, Goedele, Jean-Pierre Wils, and Bert Broeckaert, “‘We are (not) the master of our body’: elderly Jewish women’s attitudes towards euthanasia and assisted suicide,” Ethnicity and Health 16, no. 3 (2011): 259-278, SocINDEX with full text, EBSCOhost.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Shinto==
In [[Japan]], where the dominant religion is [[Shinto]], 69% of the religious organisations agree with the act of voluntary passive euthanasia.&lt;ref name="Japan"&gt;
{{cite web
|url=http://www.eubios.info/ABC4/abc4288.htm
|title=9.3. Implications of Japanese religious views toward life and death in medicine
|publisher=www.eubios.info
|accessdate=2009-02-14
|last=
|first=
}}
&lt;/ref&gt; The corresponding figure was 75% when the family asked for it. In Shinto, the prolongation of life using artificial means is a disgraceful act against life.&lt;ref name="Japan" /&gt; Views on active euthanasia are mixed, with 25% Shinto and Buddhist organisations in Japan supporting voluntary active euthanasia.

==Unitarian Universalism==
The Unitarian Universalist Association (UUA) recommends observing the ethics and culture of the resident country when determining euthanasia. In 1988 the UUA gathered to share a commitment to The Right to Die with Dignity document which included a resolution supporting self-determination in dying.&lt;ref&gt;Euthanasia: A Reference Handbook - Page 24, Jennifer Fecio McDougall, Martha Gorman - 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

== Influence of religious views ==
Religious views on euthanasia are both varied and complicated.  While one's view on the matter doesn't necessarily connect directly to their religion, it often impacts a person's opinion. While the influence of religion on one's views toward palliative care do make a difference, they often play a smaller role than one may think.  An analysis of the connection between the religion of US adults and their view on euthanasia was done in order to see how they combine.  The findings concluded that the religious affiliation one associates with does not necessarily connect with their stance on euthanasia. &lt;ref&gt;Moulton, Benjamin E., Terrence D. Hill, and Amy Burdette. "Religion and Trends in Euthanasia Attitudes among U.S. Adults, 1977–2004." Sociological Forum 21.2 (2006): 249-72. Web.&lt;/ref&gt; Research shows that while many belong to a specific religion, they may not always see every aspect as relevant to them.

Some metadata analysis has supported the hypothesis that nurses’ attitudes towards euthanasia and physician assisted suicide are influenced by religion and world view. Attributing more importance to religion also seems to make agreement with euthanasia and physician assisted suicide less likely.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kuleuven.be/thomas/images/cms/Elisabeth/Gielen%20Religion%20and%20Nurses%20Attitudes%20to%20Euthanasia%20and%20Physician%20Assisted%20Suicide.pdf Religion and Nurses’ Attitudes to Euthanasia and Physician Assisted Suicide, Nursing Ethics 2009]. The subject is also dealt with at length in Johannes A. van der Ven, Hans-Georg Ziebertz (eds.) ''Human Rights and the Impact of Religion,'' Koninklijke 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; A 1995 study of public opinion found that the tendency to see a distinction between active euthanasia and suicide was clearly affected by religious affiliation and education.&lt;ref&gt;Caddell D, Newton R, ''[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7660180 Euthanasia: American attitudes toward the physician's role].'' Soc Sci Med. 1995 Jun;40(12):1671-81.&lt;/ref&gt; In Australia, more doctors without formal religious affiliation were sympathetic to active voluntary euthanasia, and acknowledged that they had practised it, than were doctors who gave any religious affiliation. Of those identifying with a religion, those who reported a Protestant affiliation were intermediate in their attitudes and practices between the agnostic/atheist and the Catholic groups. Catholics recorded attitudes most opposed, but even so, 18 per cent of Catholic medical respondents who had been so requested, recorded that they had taken active steps to bring about the death of patients.&lt;ref&gt;Baume P, O'Malley E, Bauman A, ''[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1376534/ Professed religious affiliation and the practice of euthanasia].'' J Med Ethics 1995;21(1): 49–54.&lt;/ref&gt;

She won the [[Royal Television Society]]'s Writer of the Year Award for the 2009 mini-series [[Unforgiven (TV series)|''Unforgiven'']].&lt;ref name=RTS-Unforgiven-2009&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rts.org.uk/programme-awards-2009 |title=Programme Awards 2009 |website=[[Royal Television Society]] Yorkshire |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120312213133/http://www.rts.org.uk/programme-awards-2009 |archivedate=12 March 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Wainwright is known for her creation of the [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] drama series ''[[Scott &amp; Bailey]]'' (2011–2016''), [[Last Tango in Halifax]]'' (2012–2016), and ''[[Happy Valley (TV series)|Happy Valley]]'' (2014–present).&lt;ref name=Independent-HValley-2014&gt;{{cite news|last1=Gilbert|first1=Gerard|title=Happy Valley, BBC1 - TV review: Homegrown, Yorkshire-set drama is better than Fargo|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/tv/reviews/happy-valley-bbc1--tv-review-homegrown-yorkshireset-drama-is-better-than-fargo-9303078.html|accessdate=20 January 2015|work=[[The Independent]]|date=30 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=WSJ-HValley-2014&gt;{{cite news|last1=DeWolf Smith|first1=Nancy|title=In Yorkshire's Green but Not Pleasant Land|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/tv-review-the-bbc-crime-drama-happy-valley-comes-to-netflix-1408062549|accessdate=20 January 2015|work=[[The Wall Street Journal]]|date=14 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Last Tango in Halifax'' won the [[British Academy Television Award for Best Drama Series]] in 2013, whilst ''Happy Valley'' won the same award in both 2015 and 2017.

== Early life ==
Wainwright was born in [[Huddersfield]], [[West Yorkshire]], to Harry Wainwright and Dorothy Wainwright (née Crowther).&lt;ref name=BBC-LastTango-S1-2012&gt;{{cite news|title=Last Tango In Halifax: Derek Jacobi and Anne Reid lead cast in a new drama series for BBC One. Interview with writer, Sally Wainwright|url=http://www.bbc.com/corporate2/mediacentre/mediapacks/tango/writer|work=[[BBC One]]|date=11 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wainwright was brought up in [[Sowerby Bridge]] where she attended Triangle C of E Primary School and [[Sowerby Bridge High School]].&lt;ref name=YorkshirePost-ScottBailey-2011 &gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.yorkshirepost.co.uk/news/community/nostalgia/sally-wainwright-my-yorkshire-1-3453120 |title=Sally Wainwright: My Yorkshire |newspaper=[[Yorkshire Post]] | date=13 June 2011|accessdate=5 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; She attended the [[University of York]], reading English and Related Literature.&lt;ref name="WainwrightTT"/&gt; She has an older sister Diane Hilton, a housing professional with The Guinness Partnership.

Wainwright said that she had always wanted to write, and had started writing when she was young, from the time she was 9 years old, and wanted to write for ''[[Coronation Street]].''&lt;ref name=BBC-WritersRoom-2012&gt;{{cite news|title=2012 Manchester Literature Festival: Q&amp;A with...

== Career ==
While at [[University of York]], Wainwright took an original play called ''Hanging On'' to the [[Edinburgh Festival]] and found an agent, Meg Davis, for her writing in the process.&lt;ref name="WainwrightTT"/&gt; Meanwhile, she worked as a bus driver.&lt;ref name="WainwrightTT"/&gt; When she was 24, she left the driving job after she started writing for the Radio 4 series ''[[The Archers]].''&lt;ref name=BBC-WritersRoom-2012 /&gt; One of her contributions was to write an atypical story for the long running radio soap in which the village shop was robbed. After that she wrote for ''[[Coronation Street]]'', developing her writing skills, from 1994 to 1999. She has since said that working on continuing drama was a great education in discipline and a lesson that great stories are hard work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://guru.bafta.org/sally-wainwright-meets-matthew-barry-guru-encounters|title=Sally Wainwright meets Matthew Barry|date=30 September 2015|website=BAFTA Guru Encounters}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was mentored by [[Kay Mellor]] who encouraged her to stop writing for soaps and to concentrate instead on original work. She created the TV series ''[[At Home with the Braithwaites]]'' about a woman who had secretly won the lottery. The programme was nominated for many awards.&lt;ref name=did/&gt; In 2006 she wrote the drama series [[Jane Hall (TV series)|Jane Hall]], which depicts the life of a female bus driver in London. Wainwright drew on her own experiences in scripting the series.&lt;ref name=bus&gt;{{cite news |url=http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/tv_and_radio/article679975.ece |title=In the driving seat |first1=Daphne |last1=Lockyer |newspaper=[[The Times]] |date=1 July 2006 |accessdate=3 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She won the 2009 Writer of the Year Award given by the [[Royal Television Society|RTS]] in 2009 for [[Unforgiven (TV series)|''Unforgiven'']] which took several awards including best TV series.&lt;ref name=RTS-Unforgiven-2009 /&gt;

Wainwright says that her strong female flawed characters are almost real to her and arrive fully formed in her imagination. She likes to control the television that is created and has done some directing and production of her own work&lt;ref name=did&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/features/desert-island-discs/castaway/e539c4a2#b04k7b73 |title=Sally Wainwright Desert Island Discs |publisher=[[BBC Radio 4]] |date=5 October 2014 |type=Broadcast |accessdate=12 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; partly to ensure the scenery and dialogue reflects Yorkshire.&lt;ref name=Guardian-HappyValley-S1-2014&gt;{{cite news|last1=Frost|first1=Vicky|title=Sally Wainwright: 'I like writing women, they're heroic'|url=https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2014/jun/06/sally-wainwright-i-like-writing-women-theyre-heroic-happy-valley|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=6 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011 she wrote ''[[Scott &amp; Bailey]]'', a series about two female police officers. The idea for the series came from the leading actresses and former Detective Inspector Diane Taylor, who assisted with bringing the series to the air.&lt;ref name=cop&gt;{{cite news|title=TV cop dramas irritated me, so I made my own, says the former Detective Inspector behind Scott And Bailey|url=http://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/whats-on/film-and-tv/tv-cop-dramas-irritated-me-863725|accessdate=5 October 2014|newspaper=[[Manchester Evening News]]|date=June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wainwright based the plot of her series ''[[Last Tango in Halifax]]'' on the story of her mother who was widowed in 2001.&lt;ref name="WainwrightTT"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/features/10531953/last-tango-in-halifax-wedding-sally-wainwright-love-bbc-derek-jacobi-anne-reid.html|title=My mother's late-life love is charming the nation|first=Charlotte|last=Williamson|date=22 December 2013|newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]]|accessdate=6 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her mother, Dorothy, moved to Oxfordshire to live with her daughter and rediscovered a lost love, Alec Walker, via [[Friends Reunited]].&lt;ref name="WainwrightTT"/&gt; With her mother's permission, Wainwright developed the story of how she remarried so rapidly, publishing series extracts to her mother before broadcast.&lt;ref name=did/&gt;

When she told the story to [[Nicola Shindler]], she suggested she turn her mother's experience into a television series. Shindler became the series' executive producer.&lt;ref name=WainwrightDM&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-2229865/Screenwriter-Sally-Wainwright-Can-fall-love-75.html|title=Can you fall in love at 75?

The former was voted by [[BAFTA]] to be best series in 2012 and Wainwright was given the award for best writer.&lt;ref name=award&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.radiotimes.com/news/2013-10-09/cant-bold-and-memorable-female-characters-be-part-of-any-drama |title=Can't "bold and memorable female characters" be part of any drama? |first1=Alison |last1=Graham |newspaper=[[Radio Times]] |year=2013 |accessdate=5 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2015, it was announced that Wainwright would be writing and directing a two-hour drama special for [[BBC One]] entitled ''[[To Walk Invisible|To Walk Invisible: The Bronte Sisters]]''. Its subject is the [[Brontë family]], particularly the relationship the three sisters, [[Anne Brontë|Anne]], [[Emily Brontë|Emily]] and [[Charlotte Brontë|Charlotte]], had with their brother, [[Branwell Brontë|Branwell]]. On the drama, Wainwright said that "I am thrilled beyond measure that I've been asked by the BBC to bring to life these three fascinating, talented, ingenious Yorkshire women."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/mediacentre/latestnews/2015/to-walk-invisible|title=BBC One announces new drama by award-winner writer Sally Wainwright|work=BBC Media Centre}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2016, Wainwright told ''[[The Guardian]]'' that her next project (for the BBC) is about [[Anne Lister]], a Yorkshire diarist with an openly lesbian lifestyle in the 1800s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Ellis-Petersen |first=Hannah |date=24 November 2016 |title=Sally Wainwright to write show about diarist Anne Lister for BBC |url=https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/nov/24/sally-wainwright-show-diarist-anne-lister-bbc-happy-valley |newspaper= |location=London |access-date=5 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11369">'''Sound poetry''' is an artistic form bridging literary and [[musical composition]], in which the [[phonetic]] aspects of [[human speech]] are foregrounded instead of more conventional [[semantic]] and [[syntax|syntactic]] values; "verse without words". By definition, sound poetry is intended primarily for [[performance poetry|performance]].

==History and development==

===The vanguards of the 20th century===
While it is sometimes argued that the roots of sound poetry are to be found in [[oral poetry]] traditions, the writing of pure sound texts that downplay the roles of meaning and structure is a 20th-century phenomenon. The [[Futurist]] and [[Dadaist]] Vanguards of the beginning of this century were the pioneers in creating the first sound poetry forms. [[Marinetti|Filippo Tommaso Marinetti]] discovered that onomatopoeias were useful to describe a battle in Tripoli where he was a soldier, creating a sound text that became a sort of a spoken photograph of the battle. Dadaists were more involved in sound poetry and they invented different categories:
*''Bruitist poem'' it is the phonetic poem, not so different from the futurist poem. Invented by [[Richard Huelsenbeck]].
*''Simultaneous poem'' a poem read in different languages, with different rhythms, tonalities, and by different persons at the same time. Invented by [[Tristan Tzara]].
*''Movement poem'' is the poem accompanied by primitive movements.

===Later developments===
Sound poetry evolved into [[visual poetry]] and [[concrete poetry]], two forms based in visual arts issues although the sound images are always very compelling in them. Later on, with the development of the magnetic [[tape recorder]], sound poetry evolved thanks to the upcoming of the [[concrete music]] movement at the end of the 1940s. Some sound poetics were used by later poetry movements like the [[beat generation]] in the fifties or the [[spoken word]] movement in the 80's, and by other art and music movements that brought up new forms such as [[text sound art]] that may be used for sound poems which more closely resemble "fiction or even essays, as traditionally defined, than poetry".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ubu.com/papers/kostelanetz.html|title=U B U W E B :: Text Sound Art : A Survey|website=www.ubu.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Zang Tumb Tumb]]'' (1914) is a sound poem and concrete poem by Italian futurist [[F. T. Marinetti]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1Yld7wGWEI|title=Zang Tumb Tumb   Filippo Tommaso Marinetti|first=|last=Mizar4590|date=2 June 2011|publisher=|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Hugo Ball]] performed [[I Zimbra|a piece]] of sound poetry in a reading at [[Cabaret Voltaire (Zürich)|Cabaret Voltaire]] in 1916:
:"I created a new species of verse, 'verse without words,' or sound poems....I recited the following:
:::gadji beri bimba
:::glandridi lauli lonni cadori..."
::::(Albright, 2004)

[[Kurt Schwitters]]' ''Ursonate'' (1922–32, "Primal Sonata") is a particularly well known early example:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6X7E2i0KMqM|title=Kurt Schwitters - Ursonate  (1932)|first=|last=Laurent Cournoyer|date=24 October 2010|publisher=|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first movement [[rondo]]'s principal [[theme (music)|theme]] being a word, "fmsbwtözäu" pronounced ''Fümms bö wö tää zää Uu'', from a 1918 poem by [[Raoul Hausmann]], apparently also a sound poem. Schwitters also wrote a less well-known sound poem consisting of the sound of the letter W. (Albright, 2004)

Chilean Vicente Huidobro's explores phonetic mutations of words in his book "Altazor" (1931).

In his story ''The Poet at Home'', [[William Saroyan]] refers to a character who practices a form of pure poetry, composing verse of her own made-up words.

==Female practitioners==

It has been argued that "there is a paucity of information on women's involvement in sound poetry, whether as practitioners, theorists, or even simply as listeners".&lt;ref&gt;[[Irene Gammel|Gammel, Irene]] and Suzanne Zelazo, "[http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/modernism-modernity/v018/18.2.gammel.html Harpsichords Metallic Howl—": The Baroness Elsa von Freytag-Loringhoven's Sound Poetry]." Modernism/modernity (Johns Hopkins UP), 18.2 (April 2011), 259.&lt;/ref&gt; Among the earliest female practitioners are Berlin poet [[Else Lasker-Schüler]], who experimented in what she called "Ursprache" (Ur-language), and the New York Dada poet and performer [[Elsa von Freytag-Loringhoven|Baroness Elsa von Freytag-Loringhoven]]. The Baroness’s poem "Klink-Hratzvenga (Death-wail)" was published in ''The Little Review'' in March 1920 to great controversy. Written in response to her husband Leopold von Freytag-Loringhoven’s suicide, the sound poem was "a mourning song in nonsense sounds that transcended national boundaries".&lt;ref&gt;Gammel, Irene. ''Baroness Elsa: Gender, Dada and Everyday Modernity.'' Cambridge, MA: MIT Press, 2002. 243.&lt;/ref&gt; The Baroness was also known for her sexually charged sound poetry, as seen in "Teke Heart (Beating of Heart)", only recently published.&lt;ref&gt;Freytag-Loringhoven, Elsa von. ''Body Sweats: The Uncensored Writings of Elsa von Freytag-Loringhoven''. Ed. Irene Gammel and Suzanne Zelazo. Cambridge, MA: MIT Press, 2011. 184-85.&lt;/ref&gt;

Europe has produced at least 2 accomplished sound poets in the persons of Greta Monach (Netherlands) &amp; Katlin Ladik (Hungary), who released an EP of her work, "Phonopoetica", in 1976. In England, Paula Claire has been working with improvisational sound since the 1960s.

The United States has produced at least one accomplished sound poet, [[Tracie Morris]], from Brooklyn, New York. She began presenting sound poetry in the mid-1990s. Her live and installation sound poetry has been featured in numerous venues including the Whitney Biennial in 2002.

==Other examples of sound poets==

Later prominent sound poets include [[Henri Chopin]], [[Bob Cobbing]], [[Ada Verdun Howell]], [[bpNichol]], Bill Bissett, [[William S. Burroughs]], [[Giovanni Fontana (poet)|Giovanni Fontana]],&lt;ref&gt;[[:it:Giovanni Fontana (poeta)]]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bernard Heidsieck]], [[Enzo Minarelli]], [[François Dufrene]], [[Mathias Goeritz]], [[Maurizio Nannucci]], [[Andras Petocz]], [[Joan La Barbara]], Paul Dutton, multidisciplinary artists [[Jeremy Adler]], [[Jean-Jacques Lebel]], [[John Giorno]], Henrik Aeshna, a Paris-based poet, artist and performer who experiments with [[Noise]], [[shamanism]] and [[visual poetry]], New York City jazz poet Steve Dalachinsky, [[Yoko Ono]], [[Young Thug]],&lt;ref&gt;"[https://www.wired.com/2015/10/young-thug-evolution-of-language Young Thug Isn't Rapping Gibberish, He's Evolving Language]". [[Wired magazine]]. Retrieved 15 February 2017&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Jaap Blonk]], a Dutch sound poet who often works with improvising musicians.

The poet [[Edith Sitwell]] coined the term '''''abstract poetry''''' to describe some of her own poems which possessed more aural than literary qualities, rendering them essentially meaningless: "The poems in ''Façade'' are ''abstract'' poems—that is, they are patterns of sound. They are...virtuoso exercises in technique of extreme difficulty, in the same sense as that in which certain studies by Liszt are studies in transcendental technique in music." (Sitwell, 1949)

An early Dutch artist, Theo van Doesburg, was another prominent sound poet in the early 1900s.

==Theories==

In their essay "Harpsichords Metallic Howl—", Irene Gammel and Suzanne Zelazo review the theories of sound by [[Charles Bernstein]], Gerald Bruns, Min-Quian Ma, [[Rachel Blau DuPlessis]], Jeffrey McCaffery and others to argue that sonic poetry foregrounds its own corporality. Thus "the Baroness's sound poems let her body speak[;] through her expansive use of sound, the Baroness conveys the fluidity of gender as a constantly changing, polysemous signifier." In this way, somatic art becomes the poet's own "space-sound."&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Gammel and Zelazo, "Harpsichords Metallic Howl." 259, 261.&lt;/ref&gt;

Of course, for many dadaists, such as Hugo Ball, sound poetry also presented a language of trauma, a cacophony used to protest the sound of the cannons of World War I. It was as T. J. Demos writes, "a telling stutter, a nervous echolalia."&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Gammel and Zelazo, "Harpsichords Metallic Howl." 259.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Fingernail Test''''' is a painting by the [[Dutch Golden Age painter]] [[Frans Hals]] or [[Judith Leyster]], painted in 1626 and now in the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]], [[New York City]]. 

==Painting ==
The [[painting]] is also known as ''Boy with a glass and a lute'' and shows a young lute-player wearing a beret and a draped cloak over his chest, tilting his glass to show it is empty while facing the viewer in order to say "time is up". It was attributed to Hals for centuries until [[Claus Grimm]] called it a product of his circle. According to Hofrichter, the positioning of a figure sitting behind a table is a typical Leyster theme, and the upward glance is reminiscent of her ''Violin player'', while the application of paint is similar to her ''Two children with a cat''.&lt;ref&gt;''Judith Leyster: A Woman Painter in Holland's Golden Age'', by Frima Fox Hofrichter, Doornspijk, 1989, Davaco Publishers, {{ISBN|90-70288-62-1}}, catalog #32&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 17th-century, the gesture of tipping the glass down to see if a drop of wine appears on a fingernail was a method to show one wanted a refill. The scene is often shown with figures in theatrical costumes.

In his 1910 catalog of Frans Hals works [[Hofstede de Groot]] noted this painting may be the same one as a painting sold in Rotterdam in 1825 and wrote: "86. THE FINGER-NAIL TEST (or, The Mandoline-Player with a Wine-Glass). M. 210. Half-length. A mandoline-player sits at a table, with his body turned three-quarters right, but facing the spectator. In his uplifted right hand, with the little finger erect, he holds a green goblet downwards ; under it is his left hand, also with the little finger erect. 
The top of his orange-yellow mandoline rests on his left arm ; the bottom of it lies on the table. He has long hair, and wears a cap on the back of his head, to the right. He has a bright red costume with a greyish-purple cloak, white frills at his wrists, and a white band at the throat. An olive- green curtain hangs behind him. [Compare 74.] 

Canvas, 28 inches by 23 inches. Exhibited at Dublin, 1857. In the collection of J. Napper of Lough Crew Castle, Oldcastle, Meath. Sale. Dublin, autumn of 1906 (3990, Sulley). In the possession of the London dealers Dowdeswell. In the possession of the London dealer C. Wertheimer. In the possession of the Paris dealers Kleinberger and Wildenstein. In the collection of B. Altman, New York. "&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/catalogueraisonn03hofsuoft#page/23/mode/1up Hofstede de Groot] on The Fingernail Test; catalog numbers 74 and 86&lt;/ref&gt; 

This painting could be related to ''[[Young Man with a Skull]]'' in which a boy is also wearing a beret and draped cloak, and is also similar to a painting with the same alternate name, ''[[Boy with a Glass and a Lute]]''.

'''''The Guest House''''' is a 2012 [[lesbian]] [[romance film]] written, produced and directed by [[Michael Baumgarten (filmmaker)|Michael Baumgarten]]. It stars [[Ruth Reynolds]] and [[Madeline Merritt]] as two women who fall in love over a weekend at a Los Angeles [[guest house]]. The film has received mixed reviews from critics.

==Plot==
Rachel is a rebellious 18-year-old musician who lives with her father, Frank, at their Los Angeles home. Before leaving on a business trip one morning, her father informs her that his new employee, a recent college graduate named Amy, will be coming to stay in their [[guest house]] for a few days while she gets settled. Amy arrives and Rachel, lonely and still affected by the death of her mother, feels drawn to Amy. Over the course of the weekend, the two women spend much time together and become close. Eventually they become lovers. When Frank returns, he is shocked to find them in bed together and lashes out at both of them. To Rachel's shock, it is revealed that her father and Amy slept with each other. Disgusted and feeling betrayed, Rachel breaks off their relationship.

Some time later, Rachel performs a show at a small club in San Francisco. Afterwards, she exits and finds Amy waiting outside. The two reconcile and decide to pursue their relationship further.

==Cast==
*[[Ruth Reynolds]] as Rachel
*[[Madeline Merritt]] as Amy
*Tom McCafferty as Frank
*Jake Parker as Jason
*Jennifer Barlow as Rachel's Mom

==Production==
Madeline Merritt originally read for the role of Rachel before being cast as Amy. Neither she nor Reynolds had portrayed a [[lesbian]] character on screen prior to this film, though Merritt had previously starred in a stage production of ''[[Boston Marriage (play)|Boston Marriage]]'' while at university.&lt;ref name=James&gt;{{cite web|last=James|first=Toni|title=The Guest House – Interview with Ruth Reynolds and Madeline Merritt|url=http://www.whensallymetsally.co.uk/entertainment/film-and-art/the-guest-house-lesbian-film-review-interview|website=When Sally Met Sally|date=June 18, 2012|access-date=August 7, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reynolds found that their experience on-set mirrored that of their characters, saying, "It was a challenge because we are considered straight, so it was kind of cool to find out how comfortable it was to be with someone of the same gender...even though its something that’s completely new. So aside from our characters, we discovered it in real life as well".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hoffman|first=Kim|title=The Guest House|url=http://www.curvemag.com/Curve-Magazine/Web-Articles-2012/The-Guest-House/|website=Curve|date=July 2, 2012|access-date=August 7, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two women became friends during filming. Merritt recalled, "When Ruth and I had callbacks, we read together and we just clicked. The chemistry and connection were just there: it wasn't something we had to work at, we really played well off of each other from the start."&lt;ref name=James /&gt; Reynolds also relished the opportunity to play a musician.&lt;ref name=James /&gt;

==Critical response==
''The Guest House'' received mixed reviews from critics. Writing for ''[[AfterEllen]]'', Danielle Riendeau summed up her review by saying: "''Guest House'' is largely a fun piece of fluff, with attractive leads and a fun premise, but the film is far, far too chatty for its own good. The writing is spotty, with a few clunky lines, and the final third dives far into melodramatic territory." However, she also noted the "fantastic chemistry between Reynolds and Merritt" and found the love scenes "decidedly hot".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Riendeau|first=Danielle|title="The Guest House" is a sexy but flawed story of lesbian love|url=http://www.afterellen.com/general-news/104192-the-guest-house-is-a-sexy-but-flawed-story-of-lesbian-love|website=AfterEllen|date=November 7, 2012|access-date=August 7, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dora Mortimer gave the film a negative review for [[Diva (magazine)|''Diva'' magazine]] and found that it lacked authenticity, saying: "If you're looking for a lesbian film – hunt elsewhere. This film's only claim to LGBT issues is having two very femmey members of the same sex feign interest in each other. It is written and directed by a man and it shows."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Mortimer|first=Dora|title=DVD review: The Guest House|url=http://divamag.co.uk/category/arts-entertainment/dvd-review-the-guest-house.aspx|website=Diva|date=June 21, 2012|access-date=August 7, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lauren Shiro of [[Curve (magazine)|''Curve'' magazine]] was much more positive, saying: "''The Guest House'' is a cute, fun, and highly enjoyable movie. This is a perfect light-hearted, feel good movie for fun weekend entertainment."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Shiro|first=Lauren|title=The Guest House|url=http://www.curvemag.com/Reviews/The-Guest-House-913/|website=Curve|date=January 24, 2016|access-date=August 7, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The House of Hunger''''' ([[1978 in literature|1978]]) is a [[short story collection]] that was the first book by [[Zimbabwe]]an writer [[Dambudzo Marechera]] (1952–1987), published three years after he left university.&lt;ref name=bbaw&gt;[http://www.bbawriting.com/dambudzo-marechera/ "Dambudzo Marechera"], bbawriting.com.&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes subtitled ''Short Stories'', this work is actually a collection of one novella of 80-odd pages ("House of Hunger") and nine satellite short stories.  The small group of texts in its entirety reflects the author’s vision of (mainly township) life in [[Rhodesia]] (specifically, the period of [[Ian Smith]]’s rule of the country that at independence became Zimbabwe) — with a minority of the shorter pieces in the book depicting an African exile's experience of life in [[Great Britain|Britain]] (mainly at [[Oxford University]], where Marechera had studied).

==Content and reception==
Commenting on the semi-autobiographical nature of the book, April McCallum has said: "Marechera’s debut ''The House of Hunger'' is as much a product of being down and out in [[Oxford]], sleeping rough, being beaten up by thugs and policeman alike and struggling with alcoholism, as it is of the Rhodesia it describes.... The 'hunger' of the book’s title does not refer only to the literal starvation which was ravaging post-independent Zimbabwe at the time. Rather it implies a more far reaching and metaphorical hunger of the soul – the vacuous yearning and emptiness within the national consciousness, aspiring for more but held back by poverty and corruption."&lt;ref&gt;April McCallum, [https://theculturetrip.com/africa/zimbabwe/articles/dambudzo-marechera-and-the-house-of-hunger/ "Zimbabwe, Literature: Dambudzo Marechera and The House of Hunger"], The Culture Trip.&lt;/ref&gt;

First published to critical acclaim in 1978 ([[Heinemann African Writers Series]], no. 207), ''The House of Hunger'' the following year was joint winner — alongside [[Neil Jordan]]'s ''Night In Tunisia'' — of the [[Guardian Fiction Prize]]. At the award ceremony,  with typically unconventional and disruptive behaviour, Marechera threw plates at his fellow guests.&lt;ref name=Witness /&gt; [[Doris Lessing]] wrote that reading Marechera's work was "like overhearing a scream".&lt;ref&gt;Chris Power, [https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2014/jan/07/survey-short-story-dambudzo-marechera "A brief survey of the short story, part 54: Dambudzo Marechera"], ''The Guardian'', 7 January 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; Because it was so vivid about the experience of growing up in slum conditions in [[Harare]], [[James Currey]] (his former publisher as editorial director of [[Heinemann Educational Books]]) has described it as "a shocking book".&lt;ref name=Witness&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p024mfks "Zimbabwe's Rebel Writer"], ''Witness'', [[BBC World Service]], 18 August 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Helon Habila]] has called the book's opening line ("''I got my things and left''") "the coolest opening line in African fiction" as well as being "a fair summary of the writer's life."&lt;ref name=Habila&gt;Helon Habila, [http://www.vqronline.org/essay/dambudzo-marechera-life-and-times-african-writer "On Dambudzo Marechera: The Life and Times of an African Writer"], ''VQR'', Winter 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

Novelist Drew Johnson said in 2009: "Marechera’s knack for surprise and ambush would be the envy of any airport thriller writer, yet here it’s entirely divorced from plot.  Surprise is managed in a way that I don’t know how to explain or what exactly to compare it to—it’s just genuinely unexpected.  ''The House of Hunger'' shocked me, not because it brought me the news about some bit of brutality or another—literature from every continent and era has made that more or less routine—but because I was shocked by the words on the page, the book in my hands.  Marechera seemed to be coming at me with everything, yet with an enormous artistry.  His life seemed to be at stake in his words and, while I was reading, so did mine."&lt;ref&gt;Drew Johnson, [http://therumpus.net/2009/11/drew-johnson-the-last-book-i-loved-the-house-of-hunger/ "The Last Book I Loves, ''The House of Hunger''"], ''The Rumpus'', 18 November 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Scapegoat''''' (1854–56) is a painting by [[William Holman Hunt]] which depicts the "[[scapegoat]]" described in the [[Book of Leviticus]]. On the [[Day of Atonement]], a goat would have its horns wrapped with a red cloth – representing the sins of the community – and be driven off.

Hunt started painting on the shore of the [[Dead Sea]], and continued it in his studio in London. The work exists in two versions, a small version in brighter colours with a dark-haired goat and a rainbow, in [[Manchester Art Gallery]], and a larger version in more muted tones with a light-haired goat in the [[Lady Lever Art Gallery]] in [[Port Sunlight]]. Both were created over the same period, with the smaller Manchester version being described as "preliminary" to the larger Lady Lever version, which was the one exhibited.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.liverpoolmuseums.org.uk/picture-of-month/displaypicture.aspx?id=379 ''The Scapegoat''], Lady Lever Art Gallery&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

In the [[Royal Academy]] exhibition catalogue Hunt wrote that "the scene was painted at [[Jabal Usdum|Oosdoom]], on the margin of the salt-encrusted shallows of the [[Dead Sea]]. The mountains beyond are those of [[Edom]]."&lt;ref name = "bron"&gt;Bronkhurst, Judith, ''Wiliam Holman Hunt, A Catalogue Raisonné'', vol. 1, p.180.&lt;/ref&gt; He painted most of the work on location in 1854, but completed the work in London in the following year, adding some touches in 1856 before it was exhibited at the academy in that year.&lt;ref name = "bron"/&gt;

The painting was the only major work completed by Hunt during his first trip to the Holy Land, to which he had travelled after a crisis of religious faith. Hunt intended to experience the actual locations of the Biblical narratives as a means to confront the relationship between faith and truth. While in [[Jerusalem]], Hunt had met [[Henry Wentworth Monk]], a [[millenarianism|millenarian]] prophet who had distinctive theories about the meaning of the scapegoat and the proximity of the [[Last Judgement]]. Monk was particularly preoccupied with [[Christian Zionism]].

Hunt chose a subject derived from the [[Torah]] as part of a project to convert Jews to Christianity. He believed that Judaic views of the scapegoat were consistent with the Christian conception of the Messiah as a suffering figure. He wrote to his friend [[John Everett Millais|Millais]], "I am sanguine that [the Scapegoat] may be a means of leading any reflecting Jew to see a reference to the Messiah as he was, and not as they understand, a temporal King."&lt;ref&gt;Fleming, G.H.,'' John Everett Millais: A Biography'', 1998, Constable, p.158&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Book of Leviticus]] describes a "scapegoat" which must be ritually expelled from the flocks of the Israelite tribes as part of a sacrificial ritual of cleansing. In line with traditional Christian theology, Hunt believed that the scapegoat was a prototype for the redemptive sacrifice of Jesus, and that the goat represented that aspect of the [[Messiah]] described in [[Isaiah]] as a "suffering servant" of God. Hunt had the picture framed with the quotations "Surely he hath borne our Griefs and carried our Sorrows; Yet we did esteem him stricken, smitten of GOD and afflicted." ([[Book of Isaiah|Isaiah]] 53:4) and "And the Goat shall bear upon him all their iniquities unto a Land not inhabited." ([[Leviticus]] 16:22)

==Critical reception==

The reaction to the painting was not as Hunt expected. In his autobiography ''Pre-Raphaelitism and the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood'', Hunt relates the first reaction to the painting by art dealer [[Ernest Gambart]]:
{{quote|Gambart, the picture-dealer, was ever shrewd and entertaining. He came in his turn to my studio, and I led him to ''The Scapegoat''. "What do you call that?"&lt;br/&gt;"''The Scapegoat''."&lt;br/&gt;"Yes; but what is it doing?"&lt;br/&gt;"You will understand by the title, ''Le bouc expiatoire''."&lt;br/&gt;"But why ''expiatoire''?" he asked.&lt;br/&gt;"Well, there is a book called the Bible, which gives an account of the animal. You will remember."&lt;br/&gt;"No," he replied, "I never heard of it."&lt;br/&gt;"Ah, I forgot, the book is not known in France, but English people read it more or less," I said, "and they would all understand the story of the beast being driven into the wilderness."&lt;br/&gt;"You are mistaken. No one would know anything about it, and if I bought the picture it would be left on my hands. Now, we will see," replied the dealer. "My wife is an English lady, there is a friend of hers, an English girl, in the carriage with her, we will ask them up, you shall tell them the title; we will see. Do not say more."&lt;br/&gt;The ladies were conducted into the room. "Oh how pretty! what is it?" they asked.&lt;br/&gt;"It is ''The Scapegoat''." I said.&lt;br/&gt;There was a pause. "Oh yes," they commented to one another, "it is a peculiar goat, you can see by the ears, they droop so."&lt;br/&gt;The dealer then, nodding with a smile towards me, said to them, "It is in the wilderness."&lt;br/&gt;The ladies: "Is that the wilderness now? Are you intending to introduce any others of the flock?" And so the dealer was proved to be right, and I had over-counted on the picture's intelligibility.|William Holman Hunt, loc cit.&lt;ref name=Hunt1906 /&gt; }}
[[Dante Gabriel Rossetti]], in a letter to [[William Allingham]] in 1856, called the painting "a grand thing, but not for the public". [[Ford Madox Brown]] wrote in his diary: "Hunt's ''Scapegoat'' requires to be seen to be believed in. Only then can it be understood how, by the might of genius, out of an old goat, and some saline encrustations, can be made one of the most tragic and impressive works in the annals of art.". Ernest Gambart, as related by Hunt, was less enthusiastic, and was later to remark: "I wanted a nice religious picture and he painted me a great goat."&lt;ref name=Rossetti1856 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Cook1905 /&gt;  ''[[The Art Journal]]'' in 1860, at the time of the exhibition of Hunt's later work ''[[The Finding of the Saviour in the Temple]]'', was to characterise the painting as "having disappointed even his warmest admirers".&lt;ref name=AJ1860 /&gt;

At the time of the exhibition of ''The Scapegoat'' itself, in 1856, ''The Art Journal'' questioned Hunt's eye for colour in the painting, casting doubt that the mountains of [[Edom]], seen in the background, really were in actual appearance as painted – which Matthew Dennison, writing in ''[[The Spectator]]'' in 2008 described the Manchester version as "Day-Glo striations of lilac, crimson and egg-yolk yellow". Dennison suggests the possibility that Hunt was painting the scene from memory, when he was finishing the painting in London after he had returned from his trip to the Dead Sea, and mis-remembered it.&lt;ref name=Dennison2008 /&gt; Hunt's own description of the landscape that he painted is that "never was so extraordinary a scene of beautifully arranged horrible wilderness. It is black, full of asphalte scum and in the hand slimy, and smarting as a sting – No one can stand and say that it is not accursed of God."&lt;ref name=Dennison2008 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Fuller1989 /&gt; Art critic [[Peter Fuller]], in 1989, described the landscape of the painting as "a terrible image &amp;#91;&amp;hellip;&amp;#93; of the world as a god-forsaken wasteland, a heap of broken images where the sun beats".&lt;ref name=Fuller1989 /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5692">A '''tour manager''' (or '''concert tour manager''') is the person who helps to organize the administration for a schedule of appearances of a [[musical ensemble|musical group (band) or artist]] at a sequence of [[Music venue|venue]]s (a [[concert tour]]). In general, [[road manager]]s handle small to medium-sized tours, and tour managers are used on large-scale tours.

The performances on a concert tour are booked by the act’s [[Talent agent#Music agents|booking agent]], who works with [[Promoter (entertainment)|concert promoters]] to place the act in suitable venues and [[Music festival|festivals]] in a time frame and territory agreed with the act’s [[Talent manager|management]]. Individual concert promoters negotiate the financial, technical and hospitality requirements of the artist  and make an offer to the booking agent for the show. The tour is announced and tickets put on sale when agreement is reached on the tour dates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Waddell|last2=Barnet|last3=Berry|title=This Business of Concert Promotion and Touring: A Practical Guide to Creating, Selling, Organizing, and Staging Concerts|publisher=Billboard Books|location=New York|year=2007|page=19}}&lt;/ref&gt; As modern concert touring involves complex financial, legal and technical arrangements, the booking agent or artist manager hire a concert tour manager to organize the logistics. Concert tour managers are usually [[freelancer]]s working on a tour-by-tour basis.

==Duties==

The tour manager is given the itinerary for the tour by the booking agent. Working from this itinerary, the tour manager handles the following activities.

===Financial===
The itinerary includes information about the potential ticket income (fees) for each show. Using this information the tour manager can produce a budget for the tour, calculating costs for crew wages, [[per diem]]s, accommodation, transport, sound, lighting and video equipment, visas and work permits, rehearsals and other expenses such as booking agent commissions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Reynolds|title=The Tour Book|publisher=Cengage Learning|location=Boston|year=2007|page=13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Weekly reports are submitted to the business manager. Tour manager are on financial stabilities due to them being ahead of the whole tour.

===Advancing===
Advancing is the process of contacting each promoter and venue to ensure the entire [[Rider (theater)|artist's technical and hospitality demands]] (the ''rider'') are met and to resolve any problems the promoter or venue can foresee. The artist's rider covers catering, production (sound, lights, stagehands needed), security, general show, and legal issues. During the advancing process the tour manager checks contact names and addresses, arrival times, equipment load-in times, sound check and performance times, any supporting/opening acts, and live music curfews.

This information is collated into a "tour book" which is issued to the band and crew.

===On the road===
The tour manager travels with the band on the tour. The job on the road varies depending on the type and success level of the act. A tour manager's day-to-day workload can include:&lt;ref&gt;One for the Road: How to Be a Music Tour Manager by Mark Workman&lt;/ref&gt;
*Overseeing hotel departures on time
*Settling accommodation bills
*Overseeing travel arrangements; i.e. band and crew onto the bus or to the airport in good time
*Paying per diems to the band/artist and crew

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3787">'''''Treasures of the Underworld''''' was an exhibition featured in the [[New Zealand]] pavilion of [[Seville Expo '92]]. 

==The exhibition==

The exhibition featured 48 works, comprising a total of 399 individual pieces. It was extremely successful with over half a million visitors to New Zealand's Pavilion, making it the most-visited exhibition of New Zealand art to that time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lloyd-Jenkins|first1=Douglas|last2=Hammond|first2=Lucy|title=Crafts and applied arts - Craft in the 1990s|url=http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/crafts-and-applied-arts/page-9|website=Te Ara - the Encyclopedia of New Zealand|accessdate=24 January 2015|date=31 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The exhibition was curated by the art curator [[James Mack]] and featured commissions completed by New Zealand's top practitioners of object art in glass and clay at that time. 

The artists who contributed works were:

*[[Len Castle]]
*[[Ann Robinson (artist)| Ann Robinson]]
*[[Steve Fullmer]]
*[[Ann Verdcourt]]
*[[Darryl Robertson]]
*[[Christine Boswijk]]
*[[Richard Parker (potter)| Richard Parker]]
*[[Barry Brickell]]
*[[Paerau Corneal]]
*[[Brian Gartside]]
*[[Julia van Helden]]
*[[Christine Hellyar]]
*[[Chester Nealie]]
*[[Robyn Stewart]]

==Exhibition theme==

The theme of the commissions was the celebration of the 500th anniversary of Christopher Columbus's first voyage to America. This emphasis on voyage and discovery influenced the artists to explore the connections with New Zealand and the familiar world of the South Pacific. [[James Mack]] urged each artist to stretch both materials and technique beyond Eurocentric influences. 

==Influence==

The interest the works generated came as a surprise. [[Ian Fraser (broadcaster)|Ian Fraser]] the Commissioner at the NZ Expo said &lt;blockquote&gt;We were overwhelmed by the enthusiasm of the response....&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.christchurchartgallery.org.nz/Bulletin/96/Bulletin96.pdf The Robert MccDougall Art Gallery Bulletin No. 96 June/July 1995] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081016112650/http://www.christchurchartgallery.org.nz/Bulletin/96/Bulletin96.pdf |date=2008-10-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The work produced for this exhibition has and continues to influence the development of object art in New Zealand. The success of the exhibition also boosted the profile of ceramic and glass artists in New Zealand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lloyd-Jenkins|first1=Douglas|last2=Hammond|first2=Lucy|title=Crafts and applied arts - Craft in the 1990s|url=http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/photograph/45327/treasures-of-the-underworld-seville-expo-92|website=Te Ara - the Encyclopedia of New Zealand|accessdate=24 January 2015|date=10 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After a personal request from Queen Beatrice of Holland, the exhibition toured to Die Nieuwe Kerk, Amsterdam, Holland, before returning to New Zealand for a nationwide tour.

After the tours were complete the artworks were accessioned into the permanent collection of the New Zealand National Art Gallery - now the [[Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8923">[[File:Pala di San Zaccaria (Venezia).jpg|thumb|upright|''San Zaccaria Altarpiece'', 1505; oil on canvas, [[Transfer of panel paintings|transferred from panel]]; [[San Zaccaria]], Venice.]]
From the latter part of the 15th century, [[Venice]] had a distinctive, thriving, and influential artistic environment. Beginning with the work of [[Giovanni Bellini]] (c. 1430–1516) and his brother [[Gentile Bellini]] (c. 1429–1507) and their workshops, the major artists of the '''Venetian school''' included [[Giorgione]] (c. 1477–1510), [[Titian]] (c. 1489–1576), [[Tintoretto]] (1518–1594), [[Paolo Veronese]] (1528–1588) and [[Jacopo Bassano]] (1510–1592) and his brothers. Considered to give primacy of colour over line,&lt;ref name="PradoGuide"&gt;Prado Guide, p. 248.&lt;/ref&gt; the tradition of the Venetian school contrasted with the [[Mannerism]] prevalent in the rest of Italy. The Venetian style exerted great influence upon the subsequent development of [[Western painting]].&lt;ref name="Gardner"&gt;Gardner, p. 679.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early development==
During the early-15th century, Venetian art was dominated by the earlier styles arising from its [[Byzantine]] links,&lt;ref name="PradoGuide" /&gt; as exemplified by the work of the [[Vivarini]] family. From the late-15th century, Venetian painting developed through links with [[Andrea Mantegna]] (1431–1506) (from nearby [[Padua]]) and of a visit by [[Antonello da Messina]] (c. 1430–1479), who introduced the [[oil painting]] technique of [[Early Netherlandish painting]], probably acquired through his training in [[Naples]].&lt;ref&gt;Prado Guide, p. 223.&lt;/ref&gt; Another external factor was the visit by [[Leonardo da Vinci]], who was particularly influential on Giorgione.&lt;ref name="PradoGuide" /&gt;

During his long career, Bellini has been credited with creating the Venetian style.&lt;ref name="Gardner" /&gt; From his earlier works, such as his ''[[Madonna of the Small Trees]]'' (c. 1487) which largely reflect the linear approach of Mantegna, he later developed a softer style, where glowing colours are used to represent form and suggest an atmospheric haze. Applying this approach in his ''[[San Zaccaria Altarpiece]]'' (1505), the high viewpoint, the uncluttered and interconnected figures arranged in space, and the subtle gestures all combine to form a tranquil yet majestic image.&lt;ref name="Gardner_a"&gt;Gardner, p. 681.&lt;/ref&gt; With such works he has been described as reaching the [[High Renaissance]]&lt;ref name="Gardner_a" /&gt; ideals, and certainly expresses the key distinctive factors of the Venetian school.

== Giorgione and Titian ==
[[File:Frari (Venice) nave left - Altar of Madona di Ca'Pesaro.jpg|300py|left|thumb|[[Titian|Titian's]] early and dramatically composed ''[[Pesaro Madonna]]'' (1526), with rich Venetian colouring. ]]
Giorgione and Titian were both apprentices at Bellini's workshop. They collaborated on numerous paintings, and their styles could be so similar that it is difficult to conclusively assign authorship. A speciality of Giorgione's were idyllic [[Arcadia (utopia)|Arcadian]] scenes, with an example being his ''[[The Three Philosophers|Three Philosophers]]'', and this element was adopted by his master Bellini, who increased the landscape in his many Madonnas,&lt;ref&gt;Gardner, pg. 680&lt;/ref&gt; and by Titian in work like ''[[Pastoral Concert]]'' (1508) and ''[[Sacred and Profane Love]]'' (1515). This emphasis on nature as a setting was a major contribution of the Venetian School.

Titian, through his long and productive life, with a wide variety of themes and subjects was the most influential and greatest of all the Venetian School painters.&lt;ref&gt;Gardner, p. 684&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Prado Guide, p. 248&lt;/ref&gt; His early ''[[Pesaro Madonna]]'' (1519–1528) shows a bold new composition for such a traditional religious subject,&lt;ref&gt;Gardner, p. 685&lt;/ref&gt; putting the focal point of the Madonna off from the centre and on a steep diagonal. Colours are used to enliven the painting, but also to unify the composition, such as by the large red flag on the left counterbalancing the red in the Madonna&lt;ref&gt;Gombrich, p. 254&lt;/ref&gt; and such skilful and sumptuous use of colour became a hallmark of the Venetian style.

[[File:Tizian 102.jpg|300px|thumb|[[Titian|Titian's]] reclining ''[[Venus of Urbino|Venus]]'' (1538) an erotic work, with a lapdog on the right, balancing the face on the left.]]
Although pre-figured by the ''[[Sleeping Venus (Giorgione)|Sleeping Venus]]'' (completed by Titian after Giorgione's death in 1510) Titian is credited with establishing the reclining female [[Art nude|nude]] as an important subgenre in art. Using mythological subjects, works such as the ''[[Venus of Urbino]]'' (1538) richly depict the fabrics and other textures, and use a composition that is carefully controlled by organising colours. As an example, in this painting the diagonal of the nude is matched by the opposite diagonal between the red of the cushions in the front with the red skirts of the woman in the background.&lt;ref&gt;Gardner, p. 686&lt;/ref&gt;
With such paintings, readily transported by virtue of being oils on canvas, Titian became famous, and helped establish a reputation for Venetian art. Possession of such paintings symbolised luxurious wealth,&lt;ref&gt;Prado Guide, p. 244&lt;/ref&gt; and for his skills in portraiture he was sought by powerful, rich individuals, such as in his long relationship working for Emperor [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]] and [[Philip II of Spain|Philip II]] of Spain.&lt;ref&gt;Prado Guide, p. 254&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gardner, p. 687&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later developments==
[[File:Accademia - Miracle of the Slave by Tintoretto.jpg|300px|thumb|''[[Miracle of the Slave]]'' (1548), one of a trio of Tintoretto works on St Mark, the patron saint of Venice.]]
Although [[Tintoretto]] is sometimes classified as a [[Mannerist]] artist,&lt;ref&gt;Gombrich, p. 283&lt;/ref&gt; he also incorporates Venetian and individualistic aspects. 
In his ''[[Miracle of the Slave]]'' (1548), the Mannerist features include the crowded scene, the twisting linking of figures (as in the central figures, from the foreshortened slave on the ground to the miraculous figure of St. Mark in the sky, through the turbaned, grey-robed figure), and the drama in the gestures and poses. But the colouring maintains the warm reds, golds and greens of the Venetian school, and the figures are arranged in real three-dimensional space, in contrast to the more compressed compositions of many Mannerist works, and with its  intensely theatrical, stage-like display his painting is a forerunner of the [[Baroque painting|Baroque]].&lt;ref&gt;Gardner, p. 688&lt;/ref&gt;

Following Tintoretto came [[Paolo Veronese]] and the [[Jacopo Bassano|Bassano]]. These are a few of the most outstanding in the [[List of painters and architects of Venice|great number of artists in the Venetian tradition]], many originally from outside the Republic's territory.

==Legacy==
The Venetian school had a great influence of subsequent painting, and the history of later Western art has been described as a dialogue between the more intellectual and sculptural/linear approach of the [[Florentine School|Florentine]] and [[Rome|Roman]] traditions, and the more sensual, poetic, and pleasure-seeking of the colourful Venetian school.&lt;ref&gt;Gardner, pp. 682–683.&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically through the presence of Titian in Spain, the Venetian style influenced later Spanish art, including that of [[Velázquez]],&lt;ref&gt;Prado Guide, p. 118.&lt;/ref&gt; and through [[Rubens]] was more broadly transmitted through the rest of Europe.

In the 18th century Venetian painting had a final flowering in [[Giovanni Battista Tiepolo|Tiepolo]]'s decorative painting and [[Canaletto]]'s and [[Francesco Guardi|Guardi's]] ''[[veduta]]'' or panoramic views, mostly of the city itself. The extinction of the Republic by French Revolutionary armies in 1797 effectively brought the distinctive Venetian style to an end; it had at least arguably outlasted its rival [[Florence]] in that respect.

The '''Women's Art Association of Canada''' ('''WAAC''') is an organization founded in 1887 to promote and support women artists and craftswomen in Canada, including artists in the visual media, performance artists and writers. At one time it had almost 1,000 members. Although smaller today, it still plays an active role in fundraising and providing scholarships for young artists.

==Inception==
In 1886 the young Canadian artist [[Mary Dignam]] (1857–1938) returned from six years in Europe, where she had supported herself by organizing art tours for young ladies in Italy and the Netherlands.{{sfn|Mckillop|2011|p=57}}
She joined the staff of Miss E.K. Westmacott's Associated Artists' School of Art and Design, founded in Toronto in 1884, which taught handicrafts to women. She began to teach classes in drawing, painting and modelling in the school's studio on the 2nd floor of the [[Arcade Building (Toronto)|Arcade building]]. 
In 1887 Dignam created a young women's artists organization which shared the premises of the handicrafts school.{{sfn|Mckillop|2011|p=58}}
The organization was part of the Lyceum Club.{{sfn|Lerner|Williamson|1991|p=24}}{{efn|
The WAAC was closely associated with the Toronto Lyceum Club. The 1887 organization was part of the Lyceum Club.{{sfn|Lerner|Williamson|1991|p=24}}
The property at #21 Prince Arthur Avenue was occupied by the Lyceum Club, next door to the WAAC house at #23.{{sfn|McClelland|1993|p=84}}
It was purchased by the WAAC in 1924.{{sfn|Gallery Rentals, Women's Art Association of Canada}}
The name was retained. [[Emily Carr]] exhibited at the Lyceum Club, Toronto in 1936 and 1941.{{sfn|Emily Carr, Belkin Art Gallery}}
[[Lillian McGeoch]] exhibited at the Toronto Lyceum Club in 1957.{{sfn|MCGEOCH, Lillian Jean, Concordia}}
The painter [[Charlotte Schreiber]] (1834–1922) had exhibited at the Toronto Lyceum Club in 1892. 
Her work was again exhibited at the Toronto Lyceum Club in 1967.{{sfn|Charlotte Mount Brock Schreiber, Archive Canada}}
[[Barker Fairley]] exhibited at the Lyceum Club, Women's Art Association, Toronto in 1972.{{sfn|Barker Fairley, La Parete Gallery}}
}}
After two years, Dignam replaced Miss Westmacott as president of the school.{{sfn|Mckillop|2011|p=58}}

In 1890 Dignam incorporated the artist's organization as the Women's Art Club. It was renamed the Women's art Association of Canada in 1892.{{sfn|Mckillop|2011|p=58}}
Dignam wrote later, "We had a Royal Academy branch in Toronto but I found I had to do something to open the door for women and the only way seemed to be the organization of the Women's Art Association."{{sfn|Mary Ella Dignam, Celebrating Women's Achievements}}
The association adopted the motto of the [[Plantin Press]] of Antwerp, ''Labore et Constantia'' (Labour and Constancy), the colours of red and white and the wild rose as emblem.{{sfn|Lyceum Club and Women's Art Association of Pbo, Trent U}}

==Objectives==

The goal of the association was to encourage and support Canadian women artists, including those involved in branches of fine art, applied and performance arts.{{sfn|Holmlund|Youngberg|2003|p=216}}
According to the 1907 ''Bill No.30 An Act To Incorporate The Women's Art Association of Canada'', "The objects of the Association shall be the creating of a general interest in art and the encouragement of women's work for the purpose of mutual help and co-operation of its members, the establishment of art lectures and reading clubs, the holding of exhibitions of painting, designs, sculpture, engraving and the industrial arts, and the encouragement and development of the art handicrafts and home industries of Canada."{{sfn|History, WAAC}}

In a 1917 article in ''[[Woman's Century]]'' the WAAC stated, "Service is the keynote to happiness. Every part of the Art Association's activities is based on service to the individual, to the community, and to the nation."{{sfn|Huneault|Anderson|2012|p=39}}
The 1919 ''National Council of Women of Canada Yearbook'' defined the purpose of the WAAC as "to create a general interest in art, to encourage art handicrafts and home industries, and to establish art lectures and exhibitions of painting, sculpture and design." The yearbook added that "In this way it hopes to supply in some measure that great need of the artist: a public able to understand and trained to appreciate the best in art."{{sfn|Holmlund|Youngberg|2003|p=216}}
The WAAC appreciated and promoted the different cultural heritages of native Canadians, French Canadians and immigrants from different countries.{{sfn|Holmlund|Youngberg|2003|p=216}}

==Early years==
[[File:Her Excellency Lady Aberdeen (HS85-10-10178).jpg|thumb|[[Ishbel Hamilton-Gordon, Marchioness of Aberdeen and Temair|Lady Aberdeen]], first patron of the WAAC (1898)]]
The first branches after the 1992 incorporation in Toronto were founded in [[Winnipeg]], [[London, Ontario]], and [[Montreal]].{{sfn|McLeod|1999|p=38}}
The [[Hamilton, Ontario|Hamilton]], branch was established in 1894.{{sfn|Lerner|Williamson|1991|p=207}}
Late in 1893 the WAAC became the first women's organization to affiliate with the [[National Council of Women of Canada]], which had been founded on the initiative of [[Ishbel Hamilton-Gordon, Marchioness of Aberdeen and Temair|Lady Aberdeen]], wife of the [[Governor General of Canada]] from 1893 to 1898. 
The WAAC elected Lady Aberdeen as patron.{{sfn|Mckillop|2011|p=59}}{{efn|The WAAC and the National Council of Women of Canada were among a number of Women's organizations founded around this time and run by exceptionally capable women, others being the [[Imperial Order of the Daughters of the Empire]] (IODE), the [[Young Women's Christian Association]] (YWCA), the [[Girls' Friendly Society]] of Canada, the [[Dominion Women's Enfranchisement Association]], [[Women's Institutes]] and the [[Woman's Christian Temperance Union]] (WCTU).{{sfn|McLeod|1999|p=38}} }}
This established a tradition that has been followed since then by all the wives of Governors General.{{sfn|Women's Art Association of Canada, CMH}}
[[Florence Deeks]], who in 1912 prepared a "historical sketch" of the early years of the association, seems likely to have joined in the mid-1890s.{{sfn|Mckillop|2011|p=58}}

The group held thirteen annual exhibitions from 1889 to 1901, and occasional loan exhibitions after that.
The catalogues for the early exhibitions include paintings and sketches by members, and works on loan from private collections. Often there were also handicrafts made by members. In the 1900 exhibition there were oil and watercolour paintings, pastel drawings, designs, miniatures and 112 handicraft items. There was also  a loan exhibit that showed decorative art from many different places and ages. The catalogue said these specimens were intended to show "the possibilities open to women of artistic bent".{{sfn|Lerner|Williamson|1991|p=24}}
In 1896 the WAAC proposed that a [[State Dinner Service of Canada|State Dinner Service]] of painted china be made by [[Alice Mary Egan]] of [[Halifax, Nova Scotia]] and twelve other artists from Ontario and Quebec. The service was made and was a success.{{sfn|Lerner|Williamson|1991|p=271}}

The WAAC opened branches across Canada, eventually reaching Alberta in the west and New Brunswick in the east.{{sfn|Holmlund|Youngberg|2003|p=216}}
By 1898 there were almost 1,000 members.{{sfn|Mary Ella Dignam, Celebrating Women's Achievements}}
The [[Montreal]] branch of the Women''s Art Association was founded in 1894 by Mary Martha Phillips and Mary Alice Peck.
In 1907 it broke away from the WAAC and formed the independent Women's Art Society of Montreal. 
This was extremely successful, and in 1911 had to impose a cap of 350 members.
Despite taking the name ''l'Association culturelle des femmes de Montréal'' in 1981, it remained essentially Anglophone.
The Montreal society remains active today.{{sfn|About Us, Women's Art Society of Montreal}}{{efn|The Montreal WAAC was a precursor of the [[Canadian Handicrafts Guild]]. 
The same women were involved in both organizations.{{sfn|McLeod|1999|p=65}}
The Handicrafts Guild, led by Alice Peck and May Phillips, was incorporated in 1906.{{sfn|McLeod|1999|p=140}} }}

The [[Winnipeg]] Branch of the WAAC was established in February 1894.
It separated its members into "active" and "honorary", the first group being professional artists or serious students of art, and the second being women who were interested in the arts.
Membership rose from about 20 in 1894 to 188 in 1907. 
Most of the members grew impatient with the degree of control exerted by Mary Dignam, and broke away in 1908 to form the Western Art Association.
The last groups associated with the WAAC in Winnipeg disbanded in 1909.{{sfn|WAAC, Winnipeg Branch}}

==Later evolution==
[[File:Mary Ella Dignam.jpg|thumb|[[Mary Dignam]], the founder and long-time president, {{circa|1903}}]]
In 1912 the Toronto-based association was formally incorporated under federal legislation as the Women's Art Association of Canada.{{sfn|Women's Art Association of Canada, CMH}}
Mary Dignam was president until 1913, and remained in an advisory role for many years after.
In 1936 she returned as president for the 50th anniversary of the WAAC.{{sfn|Mary Ella Dignam, Celebrating Women's Achievements}}
[[Matilda Ridout Edgar]] (1844–1910), historian, feminist and wife of the politician and businessman [[James David Edgar]], was also associated with the WAAC in its early years.{{sfn|Holmlund|Youngberg|2003|p=84}}

Howard and [[Lorrie Dunington-Grubb]], well-known landscape gardeners, moved to Toronto in 1911 and soon after founded [[Sheridan Nurseries]].{{sfn|Butts|Stensson|2012|p=18}}
Howard became a member of [[the Arts and Letters Club of Toronto]], but Lorrie was unable to join since she was a woman.{{sfn|Butts|Stensson|2012|p=25}}
Lorrie became involved with the Women's Art Association around 1915 and was president of the WAAC from 1925 to 1930.{{sfn|Butts|Stensson|2012|p=26}}
Lorrie was also an active member of the Lyceum Club of Toronto and the [[Heliconian Club]], both devoted to women's involvement in the arts.{{sfn|Butts|Stensson|2012|p=29}}
In April 1930 the WAAC became affiliated with the Lyceum Club of London, England, and changed its name to the Lyceum Club and Women's Art Association of Canada.{{sfn|Lyceum Club and WAAC - St. Thomas}}

The branch in [[St. Thomas, Ontario]] illustrates the evolution of one local branch.
It was founded by eleven members at a meeting at the St. Thomas Business College on 26 March 1895, with the painter and teacher Miss Susan Paul as first president. 
The branch met at different locations, including the YWCA, the St. Thomas-Elgin Art Gallery and Sifton House at [[Alma College (St. Thomas, Ontario)|Alma College]]. 
Membership fees were the main source of funding, but the branch also held exhibitions, lectures, teas and other events.
The branch arranged tours of studios and museums, and sponsored display of artwork in schools.
It was most active from the late 1940s to the mid 1950s, when it usually had more than 100 paid members.
After this the branch slowly declined in activity and membership, and closed around 1990.{{sfn|Lyceum Club and WAAC - St. Thomas}}

The sculptor [[Frances Loring]] was president of the WAAC  from 1938 to 1940.{{sfn|Presidents, WAAC}}
The name was changed back to the Women's Art Association of Canada after [[World War II]] (1939–45).{{sfn|History, WAAC}}
The WAAC remains active, and as of 2014 had 200 members, including women and men. 
It is based in a Victorian-era house in downtown Toronto.{{sfn|Home, Women's Art Association of Canada}}
The building at 23 Prince Arthur Avenue was purchased in 1916 for $13,000. The adjoining house at 21 Prince Arthur Avenue was purchased in 1924.
It contains the Dignam Gallery and has a large  garden landscaped in traditional style.{{sfn|Gallery Rentals, Women's Art Association of Canada}} 
The houses at #21-23 Prince Arthur are in Second Empire style. Roughcast stucco was later covered by siding.
Neighboring houses have eclectic architectural styles ranging from Italianate to crenelated [[Tudor Revival]].{{sfn|McClelland|1993|p=86}}
The garden is named after Lorrie Dunington-Grubb.{{sfn|Butts|Stensson|2012|p=27}}

==Activities==

The WAAC founded a gallery where its members' work could be exhibited, and arranged sales and shows of paintings and sculpture.{{sfn|Holmlund|Youngberg|2003|p=216}}
The organization arranged lectures and even staged outdoor dramatic productions.
It provided courses in jewellery making, weaving and ceramics.{{sfn|Mary Ella Dignam, Celebrating Women's Achievements}}
The Home Industries Department supported craftswomen involved in pottery, weaving and embroidery, and gave them a means to become known to the public and to sell their work.{{sfn|Holmlund|Youngberg|2003|p=216}}
It marketed products such as traditional hooked rugs and French-Canadian homespuns.{{sfn|Mary Ella Dignam, Celebrating Women's Achievements}}

[[Emily Carr]] held her first solo show in eastern Canada in 1935 at the WAAC gallery in Toronto.{{sfn|Holmlund|Youngberg|2003|p=216}}{{efn|Carr noted in her diary on 19 October 1935 "I have known for some days that I was to have an exhibition at the "Woman's Art." I felt a little thrilled about this&amp;mdash;a chance to see if my work means anything to the outside world."{{sfn|Carr|1966|p=201}}
The ''[[Saturday Night (magazine)|Saturday Night]]'' review of her showing at the WAAC at 23 Prince Arthur Avenue was enthusiastic, saying, "She paints quickly and with a fierceness and passion that are completely convincing. Her technique is astonishing... there is in her work, despite its strength and dynamic movement, a joyous quality reminiscent of the early work of Vlaminck..."{{sfn|Carr|1966|p=210}} }}
The gallery often showed sculptures by [[Frances Loring]] and [[Florence Wyle]].
The WAAC also sponsored music, dance and literature. 
It arranged scholarship for young performance artists, and arranged concerts and readings.{{sfn|Holmlund|Youngberg|2003|p=216}}
In the 1920s and 1930s the WAAC staged tableaux vivants in their garden in Toronto.
From 1917 they have held an annual garden party there.{{sfn|Gallery Rentals, Women's Art Association of Canada}}

The WAAC remained active in the National Council of Women until the 1970s.{{sfn|Holmlund|Youngberg|2003|p=216}}
The WAAC continues to provide scholarships to students at institutions such as [[Canada's National Ballet School]], [[The Royal Conservatory of Music]], the [[University of Toronto]] Faculty of Music, [[OCAD University]], [[Sheridan College]] and [[George Brown College]].
Members raise funds through art shows and auctions, an annual garden party, textile shows and book sales.
The gallery and garden of the headquarters building are available for rental for use in shows and events.{{sfn|Home, Women's Art Association of Canada}}

The '''Yale school''' is a colloquial name for an influential group of [[literary criticism|literary critics]], [[literary theory|theorists]], and [[continental philosophy|philosophers]] of [[literature]] that were influenced by [[Jacques Derrida]]'s philosophy of [[deconstruction]]. Many of the theorists were affiliated with [[Yale University]] in the late 1970s, although a number of the theorists &amp;mdash; including [[Derrida]] himself &amp;mdash; subsequently moved to or became affiliated with the [[University of California at Irvine]].

==Relationship to deconstruction==
As a school of thought, the Yale School is more closely allied with the [[post-structuralist]] dimensions of deconstruction as opposed to its [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenological]] dimensions. Additionally, the Yale School is more similar to the 1970s version of deconstruction that [[John D. Caputo]] has described as a "[[Friedrich Nietzsche|Nietzschean]] free play of signifiers" and not the 1990s version of deconstruction that was far more concerned with political and ethical questions.&lt;ref&gt;(2002) Raschke, Carl "Loosening Philosophy’s Tongue: A Conversation with Jack Caputo" http://www.jcrt.org/archives/03.2/caputo_raschke.shtml&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;(2006) Zizek, Slavoj "A Plea for a Return to Differance (with a minor 'Pro Domo Sua')" ''Critical Inquiry'' 32 (2): 226-249&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==
During the period between the late 1960s and the early 1980s, [[Yale University]] was the home of a variety of thinkers who were indebted to [[deconstruction]]. The group included high-profile literary scholars such as [[Paul de Man]], [[Geoffrey Hartman]], [[J. Hillis Miller]], and [[Harold Bloom]].  This group came to be known as the ''Yale School'' and was especially influential in literary criticism because de Man, Miller, Hartman and Bloom are all considered to be prominent literary critics. The four critics listed above, along with Derrida, contributed to an influential anthology, ''Deconstruction and Criticism''. However, Harold Bloom's position was always somewhat different from that of the rest of the group, and he later distanced himself from deconstruction.

==Book summaries==

===Deconstruction and Criticism (1979)===
In his introduction to ''Deconstruction and Criticism'', Hartman draws a distinction between Derrida, Miller, and de Man on the one hand, and himself and Bloom on the other.  The former category he refers to as "boa-deconstructors"&lt;ref&gt;Bloom, Harold, et al.  ''Deconstruction and Criticism'' (New York: Continuum, 1979), ix.&lt;/ref&gt; who pursue deconstruction to its utmost conclusions and who are more philosophically rigorous in their writings.  

Hartman claims that both himself and Bloom are "barely deconstructionists" and that they "even write against it on occasion."&lt;ref&gt;''Deconstruction and Criticism'', ix.&lt;/ref&gt; Hartman claims that his writing style in particular is more reliant on the traditional role of [[pathos]] as a fundamental impetus for literary language.  In contrast, deconstruction as advocated by Derrida seeks to reveal that the very notion of pathos is caught up in the rhetorical play which is endemic to language.

==Move to Irvine==
After teaching at Yale from 1972 to 1986, [[J. Hillis Miller]] left for the [[University of California, Irvine]], where he is today Distinguished Research Professor of English and Comparative Literature.

Shortly after J. Hillis Miller's arrival at UC Irvine in 1986, Derrida himself became Professor of the Humanities at UCI. Derrida remained at UCI until 2003, one year before his death. Until his death, Derrida had slowly been turning over lecture manuscripts, journals and other materials to UCI’s special collections library under an agreement he signed in 1990. After Derrida’s death, his widow and sons said they wanted copies of UCI’s archives shared with the Institute of Contemporary Publishing Archives in France. The university had sued in an attempt to get manuscripts and correspondence from Derrida’s widow and children that it believed the philosopher had promised to UC Irvine’s collection, although the suit was dropped in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.continental-philosophy.org/2007/02/15/uc-irvine-drops-suit-over-derridas-personal-papers/&lt;/ref&gt;

The Irvine Langson Library Special Collections also houses the [[Paul de Man]] Papers, a collection of personal and professional papers documenting de Man's work in comparative literature.

'''Yiddish cinema''' ({{lang-yi|יידישע קינא, יידיש-שפראכיגע קינא}}; trans. ''Idish-Sprakhige Kino'', ''Idishe Kino'') refers to the [[film industry]] in the [[Yiddish language]]. Some 130 full-length motion pictures and 30 short ones were produced during its heyday, between 1911 and 1940. Yiddish film almost disappeared after [[World War II]], due to the [[Holocaust]] and the linguistic acculturation of Jewish immigrants, though new pictures are still made sporadically.

==Silent era==
In September 1911, at the [[Minsk]] Electric Theatre, a Jewish troupe led by one A.M. Smolarsky accompanied a short projection of silent motion pictures with the Yiddish song ''A Brivele der Mamen'' (Letter to Mother). This was the first documented instance that may be considered as Yiddish cinema.{{sfn|Hoberman|2010|pp=3–4}} At the very same time, short silent films with Yiddish [[intertitles]] were already spontaneously being directed for the Jewish public in the [[Pale of Settlement]] and [[Congress Poland]]. The most notable producer was the [[Warsaw]]-based Mordka Towbin, whose studio Siła released four short features adapted from the plays of [[Jacob Gordin]] within the year: ''Der Vilder Foter'' ("Cruel Father"), with [[Zina Goldstein]] and [[Ester Rachel Kaminska]], directed by Marek Arnstein; ''der Metoiref'' ("The Madman"); ''Got, mentsh un tayvl'' ("God, Man and Satan"); and ''[[Mirele Efros]]''. Another series of similar shorts based on plays were directed by a further Warsaw studio, Kosmofilm, founded by Shmuel Ginzberg and Henryk Finkelstein. Both companies  employed the prominent actors of the city's [[Yiddish theater]] scene. In total, including several ones meted out in Russia, some 20 silent court métrage pictures with Yiddish titles were made before the end of World War I.{{sfn|Nowell-Smith|1997|pp=175–176}}

The postwar years saw the production of full-length features. [[Sidney M. Goldin]], born in [[Odessa]] as Shmuel Goldstein, directed several films in America before moving to [[Vienna]] in the early 1920s and trying his luck with Yiddish. He produced two films: the 1923 ''Mazel Tov'', starring [[Molly Picon]] in a comedy of errors about a young American visiting her traditional family in [[Galicia (Eastern Europe)|Galicia]]; and the 1924 ''Yizkor'', with [[Maurice Schwartz]] as a Jewish guardsman who rebuffs a Christian noblewoman. In the [[Soviet Union]], two silent Yiddish films were released during the decade. These were Alexander Granovsky's 1925 ''Idishe Glikn'' ("Jewish Luck"), based on [[Sholem Aleichem]]'s wheeler-dealer character Menachem Mendel, starring [[Solomon Mikhoels]], and the 1928 ''Durkh Trennen'' ("Through Tears"), which likewise adapted Sholem Aleichem's ''[[Motl, Peysi the Cantor's Son]]'' and was directed by Grigori Gritscher-Tscherikower.&lt;ref&gt;Chantal Catherine Michel, ''Das Jiddische Kino: Aufstiegsinszenierungen zwischen Schtetl und American Dream''. Metropol, 2012. p. 46-48.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Second Polish Republic|independent Poland]], executive Leo Forbert was responsible for three silent Yiddish features which did well at the box office: ''Tkies Khaf'' (1924), based on [[S. Ansky]]'s play ''[[The Dybbuk]]'', ''Der [[Lamed Vav|Lamed-Wownik]]'' (1925), set in the 1863 [[January Uprising]], and ''In di Poylishe Velder'' (1927). These films were even exported to [[Romania]] and other countries for local Jewish audiences. Forbert's productions represented the pinnacle of Yiddish cinema up to that time, and were of relatively high artistic quality. However, they were the last for several years.{{sfn|Hoberman|2010|p=143}} New York had a thriving Yiddish cultural scene, and in 1926 Maurice Schwartz directed the first American picture in the language, ''Tsebrokhene Hertser'' ("Broken Hearts"), based on the play by [[Jacob Adler]] and starring Schwartz and [[Lila Lee]].{{sfn|Goldman|1979|p=52}}

==Talkies==
In 1929, Sydney M. Goldin returned from Vienna to the [[Lower East Side]], where he formed a partnership with producer Max Cohen. They decided to commence using the already popularized sound technology. In May 1929 they completed ''East Side Sadie'', which had a few scenes with synchronized dialogue: [[J. Hoberman]] noted that in fact, it "contained scarcely more Yiddish than the few words heard in ''[[The Younger Generation]]''". Then, on 25 October, they released ''Ad Mosay'' ("Until When"; English title: ''The Eternal Prayer''). With a budget of $3,000, this 36-minute musical [[revue#film revues|revue]] loosely inspired by the [[1929 Hebron massacre]] was the first real Yiddish talkie. Goldin then allied with executive Joseph Seiden, who established the studio Judea Film and was keen on reaching the large Yiddish-speaking immigrant public. The pair produced eight rather short sound pictures within just a year, each within a $3,000 budget and a single day of principal photography. The artistic quality of these films was deemed so low that the Yiddish Actors' Union prohibited its members from appearing in them, lest they damage the union's reputation.{{sfn|Crafton|1999|pp=413–414}}{{sfn|Hoberman|2010|pp=152–153}}

Goldin chose to attempt a more serious – and expensive – approach. He found new investors and, in 1931, spent $20,000 on making the musical ''Zayn Vayb's Liubovnik'' ("His Own Wife's Lover"), the first full-length sound feature film in the language. Goldin continued to direct, and though leading as the most prolific Yiddish film director in history with 29 titles, he was joined by a few others in the field. George Roland, for one, created eight Yiddish films in America during the 1930s. New York, with its bustling ethnic cinema industry which aimed to satisfy the immigrants' demand for films in their native languages (from Spanish to Ukrainian), now surpassed Eastern Europe in producing Yiddish-language films.{{sfn|Koszarski|2008|pp=249–250}}

In the Soviet Union, while Jewish-themed film was not uncommon, only a single Yiddish sound motion picture was ever produced. This was Boris Shpis' 1932 ''Nosn Beker fort Aheym'' ("Return of Nathan Beker"), about a Soviet-Jewish worker who travels to America only to be disillusioned with capitalism. In Poland, Alexander Marten's 1935 ''Al Khet'' ("For the Sin") had synchronized sound and was also the country's first Yiddish film after an eight-year hiatus.{{sfn|Hoberman|2010|pp=193, 225}}

The move to sound was also accompanied by an attempt to reach the market in [[Mandatory Palestine]]. However, Yiddish raised the bitter ire of [[Battalion for the Defence of the Language|Hebrew-only proponents]], who led a vigorous campaign to suppress the language in the country. On 27 September 1930, Goldin's ''A Idishe Mame'' ("A Jewish Mother") opened in [[Tel Aviv]]. A violent disturbance erupted and the screen was pelted with ink-filled eggs. The distributors backed down and agreed to release the film in a silent format. Ya'akov Davidon dubbed Yiddish films into Hebrew for the next few years, the only way they could be allowed under what [[Ella Shohat]] termed "the unofficial banning of Yiddish in the [[Yishuv]]".{{sfn|Shohat|2010|pp=47–48}}

==Brief golden age==
Producer [[Joseph Green (actor)|Joseph Green]] was dissatisfied with the low artistic merit of American Yiddish film. He concluded that in Poland he would be able to minimize production costs and yet have access to first-rate actors and equipment. After enlisting [[Molly Picon]] at a relatively astronomical fee of $10,000, he travelled to Warsaw and directed ''[[Yiddle with His Fiddle]]'' in 1936. At a total budget of $50,000, the story of a young woman who dresses as a man and joins her father's [[klezmer]] band became a worldwide hit among Jewish audiences. Expenses were covered even before its American premiere. The film was exported to Australia, South Africa, and Western Europe, where it was greeted by local Jewish immigrants. While no detailed records were kept, hundreds of thousands of tickets were sold. It was even sent to [[Nazi Germany]], where Jews were banned from Aryan movie theaters and [[Jüdischer Kulturbund|had to hold their own screenings]].{{sfn|Hoberman|2010|pp=241–247}}

''Yiddle''{{`s}} commercial success inaugurated a short boom of Yiddish cinema. Convinced there was a large enough market, producer Roman Rebush hired director [[Edgar G. Ulmer]] to adapt [[Peretz Hirschbein]]'s play ''Green Fields''. Hirschbein's piece depicted a scholarly, melancholic ''[[yeshiva]] bokhr'' (student) who leaves the study hall to meet "real Jews" and falls in love with a peasant's daughter whom he secretly tutors in Hebrew. Ulmer's ''[[Green Fields (film)|Green Fields]]'' had an international acclaim rivaling ''Yiddle with his Fiddle'', again with hundreds of thousands (even a million, according to one reporter) of viewers.{{sfn|Hoberman|2010|pp=247–253}}{{sfn|Koszarski|2008|pp=381–382}}

Green and Ulmer both remained in the Yiddish cinema and each directed several other films until the end of the decade. In 1937, [[Michał Waszyński]] directed ''[[The Dybbuk (film)|The Dybbuk]]'' in Warsaw. Investors were impressed with the success of ''[[Le Golem]]'' and ''The Dybbuk'' was targeted also at non-Jewish viewers, the only Yiddish film conceived so. While not paralleling the sales of ''Yiddle'' or ''Green Fields'',{{sfn|Hoberman|2010|p=279-284}} it is considered by most critics as the highest quality and most artistically accomplished production in the history of Yiddish cinema.{{sfn|Nowell-Smith|1997|pp=175–176}}

The fourth great Yiddish film of the era was directed by Maurice Schwartz in 1939. ''[[Tevya (film)|Tevya]]'', starring Schwartz as Sholem Aleichem's milkman, had a particularly high budget of $70,000 and a dark, contemplative plot, unlike most Yiddish productions which were popular [[melodrama]]s. Photographed in [[Long Island]], it became the first non-English production to be selected for preservation by the American [[National Film Registry]] in 1991.{{sfn|Hoberman|2010|pp=53–54}}{{sfn|Koszarski|2008|p=385}}

In addition to these four major pieces, more than 20 Yiddish motion pictures were directed in the United States and Poland until 1940. Most were lighthearted comedies or emotional family dramas, like [[Shimon Dzigan]]'s and [[Israel Shumacher]]'s 1937 ''Freylikhe Kabtzonim''.{{sfn|Hoberman|2010|pp=277–278}}&lt;ref&gt;Cf. also the List of Yiddish Films at the external links' section.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Decline and survival==     
At the very moment the industry seemed to be gaining momentum, the outbreak of World War II brought it to a complete halt. Six months before the war, Poland's last Yiddish film ''On a Heym'' ("Homeless") was released on 21 February 1939. 1940 still saw the completion of six pictures in the United States, including Ulmer's ''Amerikaner Shadkhn'' ("American Matchmaker") and ''Der Vilner Balabesl'' ("Overture to Glory") starring [[Moishe Oysher]]. Joseph Seiden's low-quality ''Mazel Tov, Iden'', an edited compilation of musical numbers, was the last, distributed in 1941.{{sfn|Hoberman|2010|pp=314–316}}{{sfn|Koszarski|2008|pp=379–380}}

With the extermination of Eastern Europe's Jews, Yiddish culture lost the bulk of its audience. In the US, the Americanization of the immigrants' children and their exodus from the East Coast's crowded neighbourhoods to suburbia signaled its demise, as well.{{sfn|Koszarski|2008|p=384}} In the Soviet Union, most Jews voluntarily eschewed [[Yiddishist movement|Yiddishist]] efforts in favour of cultural and linguistic [[Russification]] already in the 1930s; their children were raised speaking Russian, and state-led purges destroyed the remaining Yiddishist institutions.{{sfn|Shneer|2004|pp=13–14}}

In 1946, Saul Goskind founded the ''Kinor'' cooperative in Poland, producing newsreels and documentaries in Yiddish. In 1947 and 1948 ''Kinor'' released two full-length films, ''Mir Leben Geblibene'' ("We Who Remained Alive") and ''Unzere Kinder'' ("Our Children"), directed by Nathan Gross. ''[[Long Is the Road (film)|Long Is the Road]]'' from 1948, the only Yiddish film to be made in Germany, was screened for the audiences at the [[displaced persons camp]]s. Meanwhile, Yiddish cinema disappeared in the United States along with the other ethnic film industries. The two last commercially distributed American films, ''Got, Mentsh un Tayvl'' (again an adaptation of Gordin's namesake play), and ''Honeymoon in the Catskills'', were released just a week apart on 21 and 27 January 1950. In 1957, a short documentary about the [[Jewish Theatre, Warsaw|Warsaw Jewish Theatre]] was the last Yiddish production in Poland.{{sfn|Hoberman|2010|pp=328–331}}

Joseph Seiden recalled that the few remaining filmmakers had high hopes about a market in the newly independent Israel,{{sfn|Hoberman|2010|p=336}} but the state, and more so society, enforced a Hebrew-only approach. While official censorship was mild, Yiddish culture was still severely frowned upon and sometimes even legally persecuted; Dzigan and Shumacher had to introduce Hebrew parts into their shows to avoid complications.{{sfn|Helman|2014|pp=42–43}} Ironically, at the very same time, the Israeli government produced two Yiddish short films, though not for internal consumption. ''Dos Getzelt'' (1950) and ''Di Toyer iz Ofen'' (1957) were both produced for the purposes of propaganda and fund-raising among American Jews.{{sfn|Hoberman|2010|p=336}}{{sfn|Koszarski|2008|p=383}} Only in the 1960s did the anti-Yiddish cultural climate sufficiently relax to allow the projection of Yiddish films with their original dialogue.{{sfn|Shohat|2010|pp=47–48}}

The language did not disappear from the screen. Apart from select lines in many Jewishly-themed pictures, the 1975 film ''[[Hester Street (film)|Hester Street]]'' was mostly in Yiddish as was the 1982 Belgian feature ''Bruxelles-transit''.{{sfn|Hoberman|2010|pp=347–348}} In 1983 the first Israeli full-length Yiddish film was released, ''Az Men Gibt – Nemt Men'' ("When They Give – Take"), directed by Alfred Steinhardt. A second, ''The Last Love of Laura Adler'', about an elderly Yiddish actress dying from cancer, was distributed in 1990.{{sfn|Shohat|2010|pp=54}} In 2005, the emerging home video industry in [[Haredi Judaism|Ultra-Orthodox]] circles also meted out an edutainment Yiddish piece, ''[[A Gesheft]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Nadia Valman, Laurence Roth. ''The Routledge Handbook of Contemporary Jewish Cultures''. Routledge, 2014. {{ISBN|9781135048556}}. p. 268.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, the student film ''My Father's House'', about two Holocaust survivors during the [[1948 Arab–Israeli War]], was made in Israel. The 2010 ''Romeo and Juliet in Yiddish'' was an independent production which employed formerly ultra-Orthodox nonprofessional actors. The 2014 ''[[Felix and Meira]]'' and 2017 ''[[Menashe (film)|Menashe]]'' depicted scenes from the life of [[Hasidic Judaism|Hasidim]].
