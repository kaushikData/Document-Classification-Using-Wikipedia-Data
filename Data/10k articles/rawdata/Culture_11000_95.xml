The festival took place on 29 May 2015 in the city of [[Yangon]], [[Myanmar]].

[[File:AHHAA.jpg|thumb|AHHAA]]
'''Science Centre AHHAA''' is the biggest [[science centre]] in [[Estonia]] and the [[Baltic states]], located in [[Tartu]]. The main purpose of AHHAA is promoting [[science]], [[technology]] and the scientific approach to solve common disadvantages.

Since 7 May 2011, Science Centre AHHAA has been located in a building in the centre of Tartu.

==History==
AHHAA was established as a project of the [[University of Tartu]] on 1 September 1997 and by 2004 it had developed into a [[Foundation (nonprofit)|foundation]] constituted by the city of Tartu and the University of Tartu.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ahhaa.ee/about-us&lt;/ref&gt; From the very beginning, the head of Science Centre AHHAA was [[Tiiu Sild]]. In 2008, the AHHAA [[4D film|4D Adventure Cinema]] was opened in the Lõunakeskus [[shopping centre]] in Tartu. In 2009, a [[branch office]] of Science Centre AHHAA was opened in [[Tallinn]] at the [[Freedom Square, Tallinn|Freedom Square]] (the Tallinn branch was closed at the end of 2013). On 7 May 2011 Science Centre AHHAA in Tartu opened the doors of its new, 11,156 m² building engineered by [[architects]] [[Vilen Künnapu]] and [[Ain Padrik]] in the heart of the city.

The activities of the Science Centre AHHAA Foundation are coordinated by a [[committee]] composed of Hannes Astok, Anneli Saro, Jaanus Karv, Mart Laidmets, Reno Laidre and Vallo Mulk.

Additionally, the practical aspects of the activities of the foundation are appraised by a science committee composed of experts.

==Planetarium==
Science Centre AHHAA offers a view of the starry skies in a fully spherical hybrid planetarium (which means that there is a possibility to show the skies with both [[optical]] and [[Digital cinema|digital projection]], which can be displayed either separately or together).

===Constructional and technical side===
The uniqueness of AHHAA's planetarium lies in the fact that in addition to the ordinary view on the ceiling and the walls, the image of the skies in the planetarium of the centre also extends under the floor, which is the reason why the [[glass floor|floor of the planetarium is made of glass]].&lt;ref name=Aru&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Aru|first1=Margus|title=Under One Dome: AHHAA Science Centre Planetarium|journal=Planetarian: Journal of the International Planetarium Society|date=March–June 2012|volume=41|issue=2|page=57|url=http://issuu.com/planetarian/docs/june2012smaller|accessdate=2014-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===General===
*9 meters in diameter
*20+5 seats
*The first planetarium in Europe to use the MEGASTAR projector
*Currently the first and the only hybrid-planetarium (multiple projector system) in the Baltic states

The AHHAA Planetarium belongs to two organisations:
*The Nordic Planetarium Association
*The International Planetarium Society

==4D Adventure Cinema==
Science Centre AHHAA had a 4D Adventure Cinema, located in the Lõunakeskus shopping centre on the southern edge of Tartu. The cinema was open from 18.07.2008 to 31.12.2017&lt;ref&gt;https://en.astri.ee/lounakeskus/ahhaa-4d-elamuskino/&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Mullitorn.jpg|thumb]]

==Events==
The Science Centre AHHAA Foundation regularly organizes special events. Some of the most reputable events are listed below:

*The annual Researchers' Night [[Science festival|Festival]] – organized all over Estonia in the end of September and consisting of different events promoting a scientific approach to matters (such as Science Cafés, science theatre shows, tours in laboratories, workshops etc.).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.teadlasteoo.ee/en&lt;/ref&gt;

==International representation==

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6469">The '''ARChive of Contemporary Music''' (ARC) is a non-profit music library and archive based in [[New York City]]. It contains over 5 million items.

==People==

The ARC was founded in 1985 by current Director, [[B. George]] and David Wheeler (1957–1997) in [[TriBeCa|Lower Manhattan]]. Since then it has been supported by a prestigious Board of Advisors, currently composed of [[John Benitez|Jellybean Benitez]], [[Jonathan Demme]], [[Michael Feinstein]], [[Youssou N'Dour]], [[Keith Richards]], [[Nile Rodgers]], [[Todd Rundgren]], [[Fred Schneider]], [[Martin Scorsese]], [[Paul Simon]] and [[Jerry Leiber and Mike Stoller|Mike Stoller]]. Past Board members include [[David Bowie]],  [[John H. Hammond|John Hammond]] (1910–1987), [[Ellie Greenwich]] (1940–2009), [[Jerry Leiber and Mike Stoller|Jerry Leiber]] (1933–2011), [[Lou Reed]] (1942–2013) and [[Jerry Wexler]] (1917–2008).

==Collection==

The ARC focuses on commercially released popular music on [[gramophone record|record]], created since the advent of [[microgroove]] recording in the mid-1940s.  The collection contains two million sound recordings and over three million pieces of attendant support material including photographs, videos, DVDs, books, press kits, sheet music, ephemera and memorabilia.

The collection began with 47,000 sound recordings donated by Mr. George accumulated through his work as a DJ, producer and discographer.  Mr. George is the co-author of'' [[Volume, The International Discography of the New Wave]]'', and released [[Laurie Anderson]]’s first recording, ''[[O Superman]]'', on his One Ten Records label.

Major collections deeded to ARC include The Jeep Holland Collection (100,000 recordings, 1987), The Rockpool Collection (30,000 recordings, 1991), The NBC Music Library Collection (10,000 recordings, 1991), the Robert Hall Library of Sound Effects (20,000 recordings, 1997), The ABC 45 rpm Record Collection (62,000 recordings, 1999), Jean Gallia Collection of French Popular Music (6000 recordings, 2004), Ron Saja / Footlight Records Collection (35,000 recordings, 2005),  The Adam Goldstone Collection (10,000 recordings, 2007), The James Doran Piano Jazz Collection (2008), and the Jerry Rappaport Collection (6000 recordings, 2009).

The Keith Richards’ Blues Collection is the first specialty collection started by an ARChive Board member.  Since 1991 Mr. Richards, a passionate devotee of early [[Blues]] music, has supported this collection, now numbering over 8,000 discs, including a rare [[Robert Johnson (musician)|Robert Johnson]] 78, "Me and The Devil Blues"/"Little Queen of Spades." ([[Vocalion Records|Vocalion]], 04108, 78rpm, 10", 1937)

==Projects==

While the primary function is preservation, ARC has provided research services and material to many projects - film, music, and academic.

Amongst the film and reissue projects ARC has contributed to are [[Ken Burns]]’ series ''[[Baseball (TV series)|Baseball]]'' (1994); [[Jonathan Demme]]'s, ''[[Philadelphia (film)|Philadelphia]]'' (1993), ''[[Beloved (1998 film)|Beloved]]'' (1998) and ''[[The Manchurian Candidate]]'' (2004); [[Martin Scorsese]]’s ''[[The Last Temptation of Christ (film)|The Last Temptation of Christ]]'' (1988) and ''[[Goodfellas]]'' (1990); and [[Ang Lee]]’s ''[[Taking Woodstock]]'' (2009).

Larger projects include providing metadata and images for [[Microsoft]]’s Music Central, the [[Jazz at Lincoln Center|Nesuhi Ertegun Jazz Hall of Fame]] in Lincoln Center in New York and the [[Grammy Hall of Fame Award|Grammy Hall of Fame and Museum]] in Los Angeles.  In 2009 ARC partnered with [[Columbia University School of the Arts|Columbia University]] to “assist future research and help further integrate the arts into the University's educational experience.”

[[Muslim World Music Day]] is collaborative project with the libraries and the Arts Initiative at Columbia University, [[Gracenote]] and the [[Internet Archive]], which took place on April 12, 2011.  They have continued their annual ‘'World Music Days”, online databases dedicated to highlighting a country, culture or genre of music. On September 7, 2012 the ARC celebrated Brazilian Music Day.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20818">{{linguistics}}
In [[sociolinguistics]], an '''abstand language''' is a [[variety (linguistics)|language variety]] or cluster of varieties with significant [[linguistic distance]] from all others, while an '''ausbau language''' is a [[standard language|standard]] variety, possibly with related [[autonomy and heteronomy (sociolinguistics)|dependent varieties]]. The terms were introduced by [[Heinz Kloss]] in 1952 to denote two separate and largely independent sets of criteria for recognizing a "language": one based on linguistic properties compared to related varieties ({{lang-de|Abstand}}, {{IPA-de|ˈʔapˌʃtant|IPA|De-Abstand.ogg}}, "distance"), and the other based on [[Political sociology|sociopolitical]] functions ({{lang-de|Ausbau}}, {{IPA-de|ˈʔaʊsˌbaʊ|IPA|De-Ausbau.ogg}}, "expansion").{{sfn|Kloss|1967|p=29}}

This framework addresses situations in which multiple varieties from a [[dialect continuum]] have been standardized, so that they are commonly considered distinct languages even though they may be [[mutually intelligible]]. The continental [[Scandinavian languages]] are usually cited as an example of this situation. One of the applications of this theoretical framework is language standardization (examples since the 1960s being [[Basque language|Basque]] and [[Romansh language|Romansh]]).

==Abstand languages==

''Abstandsprache'' literally means "distance language". Kloss suggested the English translation "language by distance", referring to linguistic differences rather than geographical separation.{{sfn|Kloss|1967|p=29}} ''Abstand'' means a distance of ongoing separation, e.g. a clearance by mechanical design. In the context of language varieties, ''abstand'' indicates the discontinuity of two dialects; in the words of Kloss, there is a "definite break" between the varieties.{{sfn|Kloss|1967|p=30}}

An ''abstand'' language is a cluster of varieties that is distinctly separate from any other language. European examples include [[Basque language|Basque]] and [[Breton language|Breton]].{{sfn|Kloss|1967|p=30}} Kloss also spoke of degrees of ''abstand'' between pairs of varieties.{{sfn|Kloss|1967|p=33}} He did not specify how the differences between two varieties would be measured, assuming that linguists would apply objective criteria.{{sfn|Kloss|1967|p=30}} A standard linguistic criterion is [[mutual intelligibility]], though this does not always produce consistent results, for example when applied to a [[dialect continuum]].{{sfn|Chambers|Trudgill|1998|pp=3–4}}

An ''abstand'' language does not need to have a standard form. This is often the case with minority languages used within a larger state, where the minority language is used only in private, and all official functions are performed in the majority language.

==Ausbau languages==

The German verb ''ausbauen'' (literally "to build out") expresses core meanings of "expanding" something or "developing something to completion", e.g. adding to an existing structure. (Croatian linguist {{ill|Žarko Muljačić|hr}} translated ''ausbausprache'' into French as ''langue par élaboration''.){{sfn|Goebl|1989|p=278}} Kloss suggested the English translation "language by development", referring to the development of a [[standard variety]] from part of a [[dialect continuum]]:{{sfn|Kloss|1967|p=29}}
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Languages belonging in this category are recognized as such because of having been shaped or reshaped, molded or remolded—as the case may be—in order to become a standardized tool of literary expression.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Kloss identified several stages of this development, beginning with use of the variety for humour or [[folklore]], followed by lyrics and then narrative prose. The next phase, which he considered crucial, was use for serious non-fiction. From this point, the variety could be further developed for use in technical, scientific or government domains.{{sfn|Haugen|1966|p=930}}

A standard variety developed in this way may be mutually intelligible with other standard varieties. A commonly cited example occurs in the [[North Germanic languages|Scandinavian dialect continuum]] spanning Norway, Sweden and Denmark. The three standardized languages [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]], [[Swedish language|Swedish]] and [[Danish language|Danish]] (or four if Norwegian ''[[Bokmål]]'' and ''[[Nynorsk]]'' are distinguished) are mutually distinct ''ausbau'' languages, even though speakers of the different standards can readily understand each other.

This classification invokes the criterion of social and political functions of language use. The sociolinguist [[Peter Trudgill]] has linked Kloss's theoretical framework with [[Einar Haugen]]'s framework of [[autonomy and heteronomy]], with the statement that a variety is an ''ausbau'' language corresponding to the statement that it is used "autonomously" with respect to other related languages.{{sfn|Trudgill|2004|pp=2–3}} Such a language has an independent cultural status, even though it may be mutually intelligible with other ''ausbau'' languages from the same continuum.{{sfn|Trudgill|2004|p=3}} This typically means that it has its own standardized form independent of neighbouring standard languages, it is typically taught in schools, and it is used as a written language in a wide variety of social and political functions, possibly including that of an official national language. In contrast, varieties that are not ''ausbau'' languages are typically only spoken and typically only used in private contexts. Trudgill expands the definition to include related varieties:{{sfn|Trudgill|2004|p=3}}
&lt;blockquote&gt;
[A]n Ausbau language is an autonomous standardized variety together with all the nonstandard dialects from that part of the dialect continuum which are heteronomous with respect to it i.e. dependent on it.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Roofing==
Kloss described an ''ausbau'' language as providing a "roof" (German: ''Dach'') over dependent varieties, whereas non-standard varieties without a reference standard were "roofless dialects".{{sfn|Ammon|2004|p=280}} He used the term "near-dialectized sister languages" for varieties roofed by a standard variety to which they are closely related but not mutually intelligible, such as [[Low Saxon language|Low Saxon]] (roofed by [[Standard German]]), [[Occitan language|Occitan]] and [[Haitian Creole]] (roofed by [[Standard French]]), and [[Sardinian language|Sardinian]] (roofed by [[Standard Italian]]).{{sfn|Kloss|1967|pp=34–38}}

Muljačić introduced the term ''Dachsprache'', or "roofing language", for a dialect that serves as a [[standard language]] for other  dialects.{{sfn|Muljačić|1993|p=95}} These dialects would usually be in a [[dialect continuum]], but may be so different that mutual intelligibility is not possible between all dialects, particularly those separated by significant geographical distance. In 1982, "Rumantsch Grischun" was developed by [[Heinrich Schmid]] as such a ''Dachsprache'' for a number of quite different [[Romansh language]] forms spoken in parts of [[Switzerland]].{{citation needed|date=February 2012}} Similarly, [[Standard Basque]] and the [[Southern Quechua]] literary standard were both developed as standard languages for dialect continua that had historically been thought of as discrete languages with many dialects and no "official" dialect.{{citation needed|date=February 2012}} [[Standard German]] and [[Italian language|Standard Italian]], to some extent, function in the same way. Perhaps the most widely used ''Dachsprache'' is [[Modern Standard Arabic]], which links together the speakers of many different, often mutually unintelligible [[varieties of Arabic]].

==Distance between ausbau languages==
Kloss recognized three degrees of separation between ausbau languages.{{sfn|Kloss|1967|p=31}}

When two standards are based on identical or near-identical dialects, he considered them as variants of the same standard, constituting a [[pluricentric language]]. Examples include British and American variants of English, and Portuguese and Brazilian variants of [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]].{{sfn|Kloss|1967|p=31}}
[[Hindi-Urdu|Hindi and Urdu]] also have a common dialect basis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Dua |first=Hans Raj |editor1-last=Clyne |editor1-first=Michael G |editor1link=Michael Clyne|title= Pluricentric Languages: Differing Norms in Different Nations |publisher=Mouton de Gruyter |pages=381–400 |chapter=Hindi-Urdu as a pluricentric language |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=wawGFWNuHiwC&amp;pg=PA381&amp;lpg=PA381&amp;dq=hindi+urdu+pluricentric&amp;hl=hr#v=onepage&amp;q=hindi%20urdu%20pluricentric&amp;f=false |series=Contributions to the sociology of language 62 |location=Berlin &amp; New York |year=1992 |isbn=3-11-012855-1 |oclc=24668375 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The same is the case with Serbian, Croatian, Bosnian and Montenegrin, which also have the same dialect basis ([[Shtokavian dialect|Shtokavian]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gröschel |first=Bernhard| authorlink=Bernhard Gröschel |year=2009 |language=German |title=Das Serbokroatische zwischen Linguistik und Politik: mit einer Bibliographie zum postjugoslavischen Sprachenstreit |trans-title=Serbo-Croatian Between Linguistics and Politics: With a Bibliography of the Post-Yugoslav Language Dispute |series=Lincom Studies in Slavic Linguistics 34 |location=Munich |publisher=Lincom Europa |page=451 |isbn=978-3-929075-79-3 |oclc=428012015 |lccn=2009473660 |ol=15295665W}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Language secessionism#In Serbo-Croatian|consequently constitute]] four standard variants of the [[Pluricentric language#Serbo-Croatian|pluricentric Serbo-Croatian language]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Blum |first=Daniel |year=2002 |language=German |title=Sprache und Politik : Sprachpolitik und Sprachnationalismus in der Republik Indien und dem sozialistischen Jugoslawien (1945-1991)| trans-title=Language and Policy: Language Policy and Linguistic Nationalism in the Republic of India and the Socialist Yugoslavia (1945-1991) |series=Beiträge zur Südasienforschung ; vol. 192 |location=Würzburg |publisher=Ergon |page=200 |isbn=3-89913-253-X |oclc=51961066 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Bunčić |first=Daniel |editor1-last=Kempgen |editor1-first=Sebastian |title=Deutsche Beiträge zum 14.

Standards created from different dialects, but with little ''abstand'', would not be considered separate abstand languages, but constitute distinct ausbau languages, as noted above for [[Danish language|Danish]], [[Swedish language|Swedish]] and [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]].{{sfn|Kloss|1967|p=31}} The concept of ''ausbau'' is particularly important in cases where the local spoken varieties across a larger region form a dialect continuum. In such cases, the question of where the one language ends and the other starts is often a question more of ''ausbau'' than of ''abstand.'' In some instances, ''ausbau'' languages have been created out of dialects for purposes of [[nation-building]]. This applies, for instance, to [[Luxembourgish language|Luxembourgish]] ''vis-a-vis'' German (the vernaculars in Luxembourg are varieties of [[Moselle Franconian]], which is also spoken in the German sections of the [[Moselle]] River valley and neighbouring French département of [[Moselle (department)|Moselle]]). Other examples of groups of vernaculars lacking ''abstand'' internally but that have given rise to multiple ''ausbau'' languages are: [[Persian language|Persian]] of Iran and Afghanistan (''cf.'' [[Dari (Afghanistan)|Dari]]); [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]] and [[Macedonian language|Macedonian]], because they have different dialect bases.

Finally, the ''ausbau'' languages may be so different that they also constitute ''abstand'' languages. Examples include [[Dutch language|Dutch]] versus [[German language|German]], [[Persian language|Persian]] versus [[Pashto language|Pashto]], and [[Tamil language|Tamil]] versus [[Telugu language|Telugu]].{{sfn|Kloss|1967|p=31}}

== Change of roles over time ==
There are several instances of languages and language pairs that have undergone role changes over time. [[Low German]], for instance, was both an ausbau language and a roof of local dialects in the [[Netherlands]] and [[Germany]] and in parts of the Baltic states and their formerly German vicinity. With the end of the [[Hanseatic League]], Low German lost its status as an official language to a large degree. Approximately at the same time, Dutch started to replace Low German as a roof of the Low German dialects in the Netherlands that form today's [[Dutch Low Saxon]] group, and most Central German dialects went under the "roof" of the evolving [[High German]].{{sfn|Stellmacher|1981|loc=part 1}} Low German ceased to be spoken on the eastern rim of the Baltic Sea. Today, its dialects surviving in northern Germany have come under the roof of [[Standard German]].{{sfn|Kloss|1967|p=36}} Local Low German dialects spoken in the Netherlands have come under the roof of Dutch.{{sfn|Stellmacher|1981|loc=part 1}} This happened despite the effect of notable migration streams in both directions between the Western (Dutch) and Eastern (Prussian, now mainly Polish and Russian) areas of the region of the Low German languages, motivated by both religious intolerance and labour need. In several spots along the Dutch–German border, identical dialects are spoken on both sides, but are deemed to belong to different roofing according to which side of the border they are on.{{sfn|Goltz|Walker|2013|pp=31–32}}

'''Actor–network theory''' ('''ANT''') is a theoretical and methodological approach to [[social theory]] where everything in the social and natural worlds exists in constantly shifting networks of relationship.&lt;ref name="doi.org"&gt;Simandan, D., 2017. Competition, contingency, and destabilization in urban assemblages and actor-networks. Urban Geography, pp.1-12. https://doi.org/10.1080/02723638.2017.1382307&lt;/ref&gt; It posits that nothing exists outside those relationships. All the factors involved in a social situation are on the same level, and thus there are no external social forces beyond what and how the network participants interact at present. Thus, objects, ideas, processes, and any other relevant factors are seen as just as important in creating social situations as humans. ANT holds that social forces do not exist in themselves, and therefore cannot be used to explain social phenomena.  Instead, strictly empirical analysis should be undertaken to "describe" rather than "explain" social activity.  Only after this can one introduce the concept of social forces, and only as an abstract theoretical concept, not something which genuinely exists in the world.&lt;ref&gt;Latour, Bruno. Reassembling the social: An introduction to actor-network-theory. Oxford university press, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; The fundamental aim of ANT is to explore how networks are built or assembled and maintained to achieve a specific objective.&lt;ref&gt;[https://ulir.ul.ie/handle/10344/2579 Carroll, N., Richardson, I., and Whelan, E. (2012). Service science: an actor-network theory approach. International Journal of Actor-Network Theory and Technological Innovation (IJANTTI);4(3), pp. 51-69]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=rpx_BAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA115&amp;lpg=PA115&amp;dq=carroll+A+Bureaucratic+View+of+Public+Service+Innovation&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=OrMOvhK-8k&amp;sig=YljSfKMKSn1HchgCBBiJYmRnMMc&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwit-ITauIrQAhXDA8AKHbdPBS0Q6AEIKjAD#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Carroll, N.

Actor-Network Theory: A Bureaucratic View of Public Service Innovation, Chapter 7, Technological Advancements and the Impact of Actor-Network Theory, pp. 115-144, Publisher IGI Global, Hershey, PA]&lt;/ref&gt; Although it is best known for its controversial insistence on the capacity of [[non human|nonhumans]] to act or participate in systems or [[Social network|networks]] or both, ANT is also associated with forceful critiques of conventional and critical sociology. Developed by [[science and technology studies]] (STS) scholars [[Michel Callon]] and [[Bruno Latour]], the sociologist [[John Law (sociologist)|John Law]], and others, it can more technically be described as a "material-semiotic" method. This means that it maps relations that are simultaneously material (between things) and [[semiotic]] (between concepts). It assumes that many relations are both material and semiotic.

Broadly speaking, ANT is a [[social constructivism|constructivist]] approach in that it avoids [[essentialist]] explanations of events or innovations (i.e. ANT explains a successful theory by understanding the combinations and interactions of elements that make it successful, rather than saying it is true and the others are false). Likewise, it is not a cohesive theory in itself.&lt;ref name="doi.org"/&gt; Rather, ANT functions as a strategy that assists people in being sensitive to terms and the often unexplored assumptions underlying them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mol|first=A.|date=2010|title=Actor-Network Theory: sensitive terms and enduring tensions|url=http://dare.uva.nl/search?identifier=75bbc661-0a89-475a-9eef-8c8c5a2e9904|journal=Kölner Zeitschrift für Soziologie und Sozialpsychologie. Sonderheft|volume=50}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is distinguished from many other [[science and technology studies|STS]] and sociological [[Social network|network theories]] for its distinct material-semiotic approach.

==Background and context==
ANT was first developed at the [[Centre de Sociologie de l'Innovation]] (CSI) of the [[École nationale supérieure des mines de Paris]] in the early 1980s by staff ([[Michel Callon]] and [[Bruno Latour]]) and visitors (including [[John Law (sociologist)|John Law]]). The 1984 book co-authored by John Law and fellow-sociologist Peter Lodge (''Science for Social Scientists''; London: Macmillan Press Ltd.) is a good example of early explorations of how the growth and structure of knowledge could be analyzed and interpreted through the interactions of actors and networks.  Initially created in an attempt to understand processes of innovation and knowledge-creation in science and technology, the approach drew on existing work in [[Science and technology studies|STS]], on studies of [[large technical system|large technological systems]], and on a range of French intellectual resources including the semiotics of [[Algirdas Julien Greimas]], the writing of philosopher [[Michel Serres]], and the [[Annales School]] of history.

ANT appears to reflect many of the preoccupations of French [[post-structuralism]], and in particular a concern with non-foundational and multiple material-semiotic relations. At the same time, it was much more firmly embedded in English-language academic traditions than most post-structuralist-influenced approaches. Its grounding in (predominantly English) [[science and technology studies]] was reflected in an intense commitment to the development of theory through qualitative empirical case-studies. Its links with largely US-originated work on large technical systems were reflected in its willingness to analyse large scale technological developments in an even-handed manner to include political, organizational, legal, technical and scientific factors.

Many of the characteristic ANT tools (including the notions of translation, generalized symmetry and the “heterogeneous network”), together with a [[scientometric]] tool for mapping innovations in science and technology (“co-word analysis”) were initially developed during the 1980s, predominantly in and around the CSI. The “state of the art” of ANT in the late 1980s is well-described in Latour’s 1987 text, ''Science in Action''.&lt;ref name=science&gt;Latour, B. (1987). ''[[Science in Action: How to Follow Scientists and Engineers Through Society]].'' Milton Keynes: Open University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

From about 1990 onwards, ANT started to become popular as a tool for analysis in a range of fields beyond STS. It was picked up and developed by authors in parts of organizational analysis, informatics, health studies, geography, sociology, anthropology, feminist studies, technical communication&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Network: Theorizing Knowledge Work in Telecommunications|last=Spinuzzi|first=Clay|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2008|isbn=9780521895040|location=New York|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Read|first=Sarah|last2=Swarts|first2=Jason|date=2015|title=Visualizing and Tracing: Research Methodologies for the Study of Networked, Sociotechnical Activity, Otherwise Known as Knowledge Work|url=https://doi.org/10.1080/10572252.2015.975961|journal=Technical Communication Quarterly|volume=24|issue=1|pages=14-44|doi=10.1080/10572252.2015.975961|via=Taylor &amp; Francis}}&lt;/ref&gt; and economics.&lt;ref name="Müller, M 2016. pp.217-229"&gt;Müller, M. and Schurr, C., 2016. Assemblage thinking and actor‐network theory: conjunctions, disjunctions, cross‐fertilisations. Transactions of the Institute of British Geographers, 41(3), pp.217-229.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{as of|2008}}, ANT is a widespread, if controversial, range of material-semiotic approaches for the analysis of heterogeneous relations. In part because of its popularity, it is interpreted and used in a wide range of alternative and sometimes incompatible ways. There is no orthodoxy in current ANT, and different authors use the approach in substantially different ways. Some authors talk of “after-ANT” to refer to “successor projects” blending together different problem-focuses with those of ANT.&lt;ref&gt;John Law and John Hassard (eds) (1999). ''Actor Network Theory and After'' (Oxford and Keele: Blackwell and the Sociological Review).&lt;/ref&gt;

==A material-semiotic method==
Although it is called a “[[Philosophical theory|theory]]”, ANT does not usually explain “why” or "how" a network takes the form that it does.&lt;ref name=RtS /&gt; Rather, ANT is a way of thoroughly exploring the relational ties within a network (which can be a multitude of different things). As Latour notes,&lt;ref name=technology&gt;Latour, B. (1999). [http://www.bruno-latour.fr/sites/default/files/46-TECHNOLOGY-DURABLE-GBpdf.pdf "Technology Is Society Made Durable"]. In Law, J., ed., ''Sociology of Monsters''.&lt;/ref&gt; "explanation does not follow from description; it is description taken that much further." It is not, in other words, a theory "of" anything, but rather a method, or a "how-to book" as Latour &lt;ref name=RtS /&gt; puts it.

The approach is related to other versions of material-semiotics (notably the work of philosophers [[Gilles Deleuze]], [[Michel Foucault]], and feminist scholar [[Donna Haraway]]). It can also be seen as a way of being faithful to the insights of [[ethnomethodology]] and its detailed descriptions of how common activities, habits and procedures sustain themselves.  Similarities between ANT and [[symbolic interactionist]] approaches such as the newer forms of [[grounded theory]] like [[situational analysis]], exist,&lt;ref&gt;Fernback, J., 2007. “Beyond the Diluted Community Concept: A Symbolic Interactionist Perspective on Online Social Relations.” ''New Media &amp; Society'', 9(1), pp.49-69. [[doi:10.1177/1461444807072417]]&lt;/ref&gt; although Latour&lt;ref&gt;Blok, A, &amp; Elgaard Jensen, T. (2011). ''[http://www.excursions-journal.org.uk/index.php/excursions/article/download/100/134 Bruno Latour: Hybrid thoughts in a hybrid world] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150524023006/http://www.excursions-journal.org.uk/index.php/excursions/article/download/100/134 |date=May 24, 2015 }}''. Suffolk: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt; objects to such a comparison.

Although ANT is mostly associated with studies of science and technology and with the sociology of science, it has been making steady progress in other fields of sociology as well.  ANT is adamantly empirical, and as such yields useful insights and tools for sociological inquiry in general. ANT has been deployed in studies of identity and subjectivity, urban transportation systems, and passion and addiction.&lt;ref&gt;See e.g. Gomart, Emilie, and Hennion, Antoin (1999) “[https://www.academia.edu/866668/A_Sociology_of_Attachment_Music_Amateurs_Drug_Addicts A Sociology of Attachment: Music Amateurs, Drug Users]”.

==The actor-network==
As the term implies, the actor-network is the central concept in ANT. The term "network" is somewhat problematic in that as Latour &lt;ref name=RtS /&gt;&lt;ref name=technology /&gt;&lt;ref name=on&gt;Latour, B. "[http://www.bruno-latour.fr/sites/default/files/P-67%20ACTOR-NETWORK.pdf On Actor Network Theory: A Few Clarifications]"&lt;/ref&gt; notes, it has a number of unwanted connotations. Firstly, it implies that what is described takes the shape of a network, which is not necessarily the case. Secondly, it implies "transportation without deformation," which, in ANT, is not possible since any actor-network involves a vast number of [[#Translation|translations]]. Latour,&lt;ref name=on /&gt; however, still contends that network is a fitting term to use, because "it has no a priori order relation; it is not tied to the axiological myth of a top and of a bottom of society; it makes absolutely no assumption whether a specific locus is macro- or micro- and does not modify the tools to study the element 'a' or the element 'b'." This use of the term "network" is very similar to Deleuze and Guattari's [[Rhizome (philosophy)|rhizomes]]; Latour &lt;ref name=technology /&gt; even remarks tongue in cheek that he would have no objection to renaming ANT "actant-rhizome ontology" if it only had sounded better, which hints at Latour's uneasiness with the word "theory".

Actor–network theory tries to explain how material–semiotic networks come together to act as a whole; the clusters of actors involved in creating meaning are both material and semiotic. As a part of this it may look at explicit strategies for relating different elements together into a network so that they form an apparently coherent whole. These networks are potentially transient, existing in a constant making and re-making.&lt;ref name=RtS&gt;Latour, B., 2005. ''[[Bruno Latour#Reassembling the Social|Reassembling the Social: An Introduction to Actor-Network-Theory]]''. Oxford: Oxford UP.&lt;/ref&gt; This means that relations need to be repeatedly “performed” or the network will dissolve. They also assume that networks of relations are not intrinsically coherent, and may indeed contain conflicts. Social relations, in other words, are only ever in process, and must be [[Performativity|performed]] continuously.

Actants denote human and non-human actors, and in a network take the shape that they do by virtue of their relations with one another. It assumes that nothing lies outside the network of relations, and as noted above, suggests that there is no difference in the ability of technology, humans, animals, or other non-humans to act (and that there are only enacted alliances). As soon as an actor engages with an actor-network it too is caught up in the web of relations, and becomes part of the [[entelechy]].

If taken to its logical conclusion, then, nearly any actor can be considered merely a sum of other, smaller actors. A car is an example of a complex system. It contains many electronic and [[machine|mechanical]] components, all of which are essentially hidden from view to the driver, who simply deals with the car as a single object. This effect is known as ''punctualisation'', and is similar to the idea of [[Encapsulation (object-oriented programming)|encapsulation]] in [[object-oriented programming]].

When an actor network breaks down, the punctualisation effect tends to cease as well. In the automobile example above, a non-working engine would cause the driver to become aware of the car as a collection of parts rather than just a vehicle capable of transporting them from place to place. This can also occur when elements of a network act contrarily to the network as a whole. In his book ''Pandora’s Hope'', Latour likens depunctualization to the opening of a black box. When closed, the box is perceived simply as a box, although when it is opened all elements inside it becomes visible.

==Human and non-human actors==
ANT is often associated with the equal treatment of human and non-human actors. ANT assumes that all entities in a network can and should be described in the same terms. This is called the principle of ''[[generalized symmetry]]''. The rationale for this is that differences between them are generated in the network of relations, and should not be presupposed.&lt;ref name="Müller, M 2016. pp.217-229"/&gt;

===Intermediaries and mediators===
The distinction between intermediaries and mediators is key to ANT sociology. Intermediaries are entities which make no difference (to some interesting state of affairs which we are studying) and so can be ignored. They transport the force of some other entity more or less without transformation and so are fairly uninteresting. Mediators, on the other hand, are entities which multiply difference and so should be the object of study. Their outputs cannot be predicted by their inputs. From an ANT point of view, sociology has tended to treat too much of the world as intermediaries.

For instance, a sociologist might take silk and nylon as intermediaries, holding that the former “means”, “reflects”, or “symbolises” the upper classes and the latter the lower classes. In such a view, the real-world silk–nylon difference is irrelevant — presumably, many other material differences could also, and do also, transport this class distinction. But taken as mediators, these fabrics would have to be engaged with by the analyst in their specificity: the internal real-world complexities of silk and nylon suddenly appear relevant, and are seen as actively constructing the ideological class distinction which they once merely reflected.

For the committed ANT analyst, social things like class distinctions in taste, as in the silk and nylon example, are examples of social construction, but also groups and power must constantly be constructed or performed anew through complex engagements with complex mediators. There is no stand-alone social repertoire lying in the background to be reflected off, expressed through, or substantiated in, interactions (as in an intermediary conception). That being said, it doesn't make sense to say there are social aspects of things. Things themselves are a constitutive part of the social reality they are able to enact.&lt;ref name=RtS /&gt;

==Other central concepts==

===Translation===
{{main|Translation (sociology)}}
Central to ANT is the concept of translation which is sometimes referred to as '''sociology of translation''', in which innovators attempt to create a ''forum,'' a central network in which all the actors agree that the network is worth building and defending. In his widely debated 1986 study of how marine biologists try to restock the St Brieuc Bay in order to produce more scallops,&lt;ref&gt;Michel Callon (1986). “[http://www.vub.ac.be/SOCO/tesa/RENCOM/Callon%20%281986%29%20Some%20elements%20of%20a%20sociology%20of%20translation.pdf Some Elements of a Sociology of Translation: Domestication of the Scallops and the Fishermen of St Brieuc Bay]”. In John Law (ed.), ''Power, Action and Belief: A New Sociology of Knowledge'' (London: Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul).&lt;/ref&gt; [[Michel Callon]] has defined 4 moments of translation: [[problematization]], [[interessement]], enrollment and mobilisation of allies.  Also important to the notion is the role of network objects in helping to smooth out the translation process by creating equivalencies between what would otherwise be very challenging people, organizations or conditions to mesh together.  Bruno Latour spoke about this particular task of objects in his work ''Reassembling the Social'' (2005).

=== Tokens, or quasi-objects ===
In the above examples, “social order” and “functioning car” come into being through the successful interactions of their respective actor-networks, and actor-network theory refers to these creations as ''tokens'' or ''quasi-objects'' which are passed between actors within the network.

As the token is increasingly transmitted or passed through the network, it becomes increasingly punctualized and also increasingly [[Reification (Marxism)|reified]]. When the token is decreasingly transmitted, or when an actor fails to transmit the token (e.g., the oil pump breaks), punctualization and reification are decreased as well.

== Actor network theory and specific disciplines ==
Recently, there has been a movement to introduce Actor Network Theory as an analytical tool to a range of applied disciplines outside of sociology, including nursing, public health, business (Klein and Czarniawska, 2005), library and information science (Beagle, 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{ Cite journal|url = |title = The Sociotechnical Networks of Scholarly Communication.|last = Beagle|first = Donald|date = 2001|journal = Portal: Libraries and the Academy |volume=1 |issue=4 |pages=421–443|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt;); urban studies (Farias and Bender, 2010), and community, urban, and regional planning (Beauregard, 2012;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Planning with Things|last = Beauregard|first = Robert|date = 2012|journal = Journal of Planning Education and Research |volume=32 |pages=182–190|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Beauregard and Lieto, 2015; Rydin, 2012;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Using Actor-Network Theory to understand planning practice: Exploring relationships between actants in regulating low-carbon commercial development|last = Rydin|first = Yvonne|date = 2012|journal = Planning Theory |volume=12 |issue=1 |pages=23–45|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Rydin and Tate, 2016, Tate, 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Growth management implementation in Metro Vancouver: Lessons  from actor network theory.|last = Tate|first = Laura|date = 2013|journal = Environment and Planning B |volume=40 |issue= |pages=783–800|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt;).

=== ANT and international relations ===
Actor-Network Theory has become increasingly prominent within the discipline of [[International Relations]] and [[Political Science]].

Theoretically, scholars within IR have employed ANT in order to disrupt traditional world political binaries (civilised/barbarian, democratic/autocratic, etc.),&lt;ref name="ejt.sagepub.com"&gt;Austin, Jonathan Luke., 2015. [http://ejt.sagepub.com/content/early/2015/11/26/1354066115616466.abstract "We have never been civilized: Torture and the Materiality of World Political Binaries."] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151204051611/http://ejt.sagepub.com/content/early/2015/11/26/1354066115616466.abstract |date=2015-12-04 }} ''European Journal of International Relations'', [[doi:10.1177/1354066115616466]]&lt;/ref&gt; consider the implications of a posthuman understanding of IR,&lt;ref&gt;Cudworth, E. and Hobden, S, 2013. “Of parts and wholes: International Relations beyond the human.” ''Millennium: Journal of International Studies', 41(3), pp.430-450.&lt;/ref&gt; explore the infrastructures of world politics,&lt;ref&gt;Barry, A., 2013. “Material Politics.”&lt;/ref&gt; and consider the effects of technological agency.&lt;ref&gt;Leander, A., 2013. “Technological agency in the co-constitution of legal expertise and the US drone program.” ''Leiden Journal of International Law', 26(4), pp.811-831.&lt;/ref&gt;

Empirically, IR scholars have drawn on insights from ANT in order to study phenomena including political violences like the use of torture and drones,&lt;ref name="ejt.sagepub.com"/&gt; piracy and maritime governance,&lt;ref&gt;Bueger C., 2013. “Practice, pirates, and coast guards.” ''Third World Quarterly', 34(10), pp.1811-1827.&lt;/ref&gt; and garbage.&lt;ref&gt;Acuto, M., 2014. “Everyday International Relations.” ''International Political Sociology', 8(4).&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ANT and design ===
The Actor-Network Theory can also be applied to design, using a perspective that is not simply limited to an analysis of an object's structure. From the ANT viewpoint, design is seen as a series of features that account for a social, psychological, and economical world. ANT argues that objects are designed to shape human action and mold or influence decisions. In this way, the objects' design serves to mediate human relationships and can even impact our morality, ethics, and politics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Yaneva|first=Albena|title=Making the Social Hold: Towards an Actor-Network Theory of Design|journal=Design and Culture|publication-date=2009|volume=1|issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
Actor–network theory insists on the capacity of [[non human|nonhumans]] to be actors or participants in networks and systems. Critics including figures such as [[Langdon Winner]] maintain that such properties as ''[[intentionality]]'' fundamentally distinguish humans from animals or from “things” (see [[Activity Theory]]).&lt;ref&gt;Winner, L. (1993). [http://www.nyu.edu/projects/nissenbaum/papers/openingblackbox.pdf "Upon Opening the Black Box and Finding It Empty : Social Constructivism and the Philosophy of Technology Science, Technology, &amp; Human Values"] (Vol. 18, pp. 362-378).&lt;/ref&gt; ANT scholars {{Who|date=December 2012}} respond with the following arguments:
* They do not attribute intentionality and similar properties to [[non human|nonhumans]].
* Their conception of [[human agency|agency]] does not presuppose intentionality.
* They locate agency neither in human “subjects” nor in non-human “objects”, but in heterogeneous associations of humans and nonhumans.

ANT has been criticized as amoral. [[Wiebe Bijker]] has responded to this criticism by stating that the amorality of ANT is not a necessity. Moral and political positions are possible, but one must first describe the network before taking up such positions. This position has been further explored by Stuart Shapiro who contrasts ANT with the history of ecology, and argues that research decisions are moral rather than methodological, but this moral dimension has been sidelined.&lt;ref&gt;Shapiro, S. (1997). Caught in a web: The implications of ecology for radical symmetry in STS. Social Epistemology, 11(1), 97-110. [[doi:10.1080/02691729708578832]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Whittle and Spicer note that "ANT has also sought to move beyond deterministic models that trace organizational phenomena back to powerful individuals, social structures, hegemonic discourses or technological effects. Rather, ANT prefers to seek out complex patterns of causality rooted in connections between actors." They argue that ANT's ontological realism makes it "less well equipped for pursuing a critical account of organizations—that is, one which recognises the unfolding nature of reality, considers the limits of knowledge and seeks to challenge structures of domination." &lt;ref&gt;Andrea Whittle and [[André Spicer]], 2008. Is actor network theory critique? ''Organization Studies'' 2008 29: 611&lt;/ref&gt; This implies that ANT does not account for pre-existing structures, such as power, but rather sees these structures as emerging from the actions of actors within the network and their ability to align in pursuit of their interests. Accordingly, ANT can be seen as an attempt to re-introduce [[Whig history]] into [[science and technology studies]]; like the myth of the [[Heroic theory of invention and scientific development|heroic inventor]], ANT can be seen as an attempt to explain successful innovators by saying only that they were successful. Likewise, for organization studies, Whittle and Spicer assert that ANT is, "ill suited to the task of developing political alternatives to the imaginaries of market managerialism."

Key early criticism came from other members of the STS community, in particular the "Epistemological Chicken" debate between Collins and Yearley with responses from Latour and Callon as well as Woolgar.{{Citation needed|date=May 2014}} Collins and Yearley accused ANTs approach of collapsing into an endless relativist regress.&lt;ref&gt;Collins, H. M., &amp; Yearley, S. (1992). Epistemological Chicken. In A. Pickering (Ed.), Science as Practice and Culture (pp. 301-326). Chicago: The University of Chicago Press.&lt;/ref&gt;   Some critics&lt;ref&gt;Amsterdamska, O. (1990). 'Surely You're Joking, Mr Latour!'. Science, Technology, Human Values. Vol.15(4) pp.495-504.&lt;/ref&gt; have argued that research based on ANT perspectives remains entirely descriptive and fails to provide explanations for social processes. ANT—like comparable social scientific methods—requires judgement calls from the researcher as to which actors are important within a network and which are not. Critics{{Who|date=July 2013}} argue that the importance of particular actors cannot be determined in the absence of “out-of-network” criteria. Similarly, others{{Who|date=October 2014}} argue that actor-networks risk degenerating into endless chains of association ([[six degrees of separation]]—we are all networked to one another). Other research perspectives such as [[social constructionism]], [[social shaping of technology]], [[social network theory]], [[normalization process theory]], [[Diffusion of Innovations]] theory are held to be important alternatives to ANT approaches.

In a workshop called “On Recalling ANT”, [[Bruno Latour]] stated that there are four things wrong with actor-network theory: “actor”, “network”, “theory” and the hyphen.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lancaster.ac.uk/sociology/research/publications/papers/latour-recalling-ant.pdf Keynote Speech: On Recalling ANT] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714210351/http://www.lancaster.ac.uk/sociology/research/publications/papers/latour-recalling-ant.pdf |date=July 14, 2014 }}, Lancester University, Department of Sociology&lt;/ref&gt; In a later book however (''[[Bruno Latour#Reassembling the Social|Reassembling the Social: An Introduction to Actor–Network–Theory]]''), Latour reversed himself, accepting the wide use of the term, “''including'' the hyphen” (Latour 2005:9).{{Full citation needed|date=May 2014}} He also remarked how he had been helpfully reminded that the ANT acronym “was perfectly fit for a blind, myopic, workaholic, trail-sniffing, and collective traveler” (the ant, Latour 2005:9) — qualitative hallmarks of actor-network [[epistemology]].

'''''Behind the Candelabra''''' is a 2013 American [[Biographical film|biographical]] [[Drama (film and television)|drama film]] directed by [[Steven Soderbergh]]. It dramatizes the last ten years in the life of pianist [[Liberace]] and the relationship he had with [[Scott Thorson]]. It is based on Thorson's memoir, ''[[Behind the Candelabra: My Life with Liberace]]'' (1988).&lt;ref name="earlyword" /&gt; [[Richard LaGravenese]] wrote the screenplay. [[Jerry Weintraub]] was the executive producer.

==Plot==
In 1977, 18-year-old [[Scott Thorson]] ([[Matt Damon]]), who works as an [[Animal training|animal trainer]] for films, meets Bob Black ([[Scott Bakula]]), a Hollywood producer, in a gay bar in Los Angeles.  At Black's urging, he leaves his adopted home in search of better-paying work.  Black introduces Thorson to [[Liberace]] ([[Michael Douglas]]), who takes an immediate liking to the handsome younger man.  Liberace invites the two backstage and then to his luxurious home in Las Vegas.  Thorson observes that one of Liberace's beloved dogs is suffering from a temporary form of blindness, and with his veterinary assistant background, informs the famous pianist that he knows how to cure the condition.  After treating the dog, Thorson becomes Liberace's "assistant" at the performer's request. Thorson also becomes employed as Liberace's stage chauffeur, driving a Rolls-Royce limousine onto the stage for Liberace's grand entrances.

Thorson moves in with Liberace and becomes his lover.  At this point, Thorson says that he is [[Bisexuality|bisexual]] because he is also attracted to women.  Liberace is sympathetic, informing him that he wanted and tried to love women, but was exclusively attracted to men.  He relates a story of a "divine healing" in which a "messenger" informed him that God still loved him.

It gradually becomes clear that Liberace is trying to mold Thorson into a younger version of himself.  He asks his plastic surgeon, Dr. Jack Startz ([[Rob Lowe]]), to transform Scott's face to more closely resemble his own and makes an unsuccessful attempt to formally adopt him.  Thorson soon turns to drugs as he becomes more angry and frustrated with Liberace trying to control him as well as Liberace's obsession to publicly hide their romance at any cost.

By 1982, Thorson's increasing drug abuse and Liberace's interest in younger men, including dancer Cary James ([[Boyd Holbrook]]), creates a rift that ultimately destroys their relationship.  When Liberace begins visiting pornographic peep shows and suggests that they each see other people, Thorson becomes upset.  Thorson retains an attorney to seek his financial share of the property by suing Liberace for over $100,000,000 in [[palimony]].  As a result, Liberace ends their formal partnership and involves himself with his most recent, and much younger, "assistant".  In 1984, Thorson's palimony lawsuit starts where he gives details about his five-year romance with the entertainer, while Liberace flatly denies any sexual relationship.

Not long thereafter, in December 1986, Thorson receives a phone call from Liberace telling him that he is very sick with what is later revealed to be [[HIV/AIDS|AIDS]] and that he would like Thorson to visit him again.  Thorson agrees and drives to Liberace's retreat house in Palm Springs, where he and Liberace have one last, emotional conversation. Liberace dies a few months later in February 1987.  Thorson attends Liberace's funeral, in which he imagines seeing Liberace performing one last time with his traditional flamboyance, before being lifted to Heaven with a stage harness.

[[File:Liberace's rhinestone car TWC jeh.jpg|thumb|Car used in the production]]

Director [[Steven Soderbergh]] first spoke with [[Michael Douglas]] about the idea of doing a [[Liberace]] film during the production of'' [[Traffic (2000 film)|Traffic]]'' (2000), but had trouble figuring out an angle for it that would differentiate it from a traditional biopic.&lt;ref name="OAAN"&gt;{{cite web|last=Azzopardi|first=Chris|title=Behind the ‘Candelabra’|url=http://www.outandaboutnashville.com/story/behind-candelabra|publisher=Out &amp; About Nashville|accessdate=June 2, 2013|date=May 16, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the summer of 2008, Soderbergh contacted screenwriter [[Richard LaGravenese]] with the idea of adapting [[Scott Thorson]]'s memoir ''[[Behind the Candelabra: My Life with Liberace]]''.&lt;ref name="collider"&gt;{{cite web |last= Radish |first= Christina |title= Richard LaGravenese Talks BEHIND THE CANDELABRA, Signing on to the Film, Input from Matt Damon and Michael Douglas &amp; Working with Steven Soderbergh |url= http://collider.com/richard-lagravenese-behind-the-candelabra-interview/ |publisher= Collider.com |accessdate = June 1, 2013 |date= May 26, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2008, the project was officially announced with [[Matt Damon]] close to signing on to play Thorson and Douglas in talks to portray Liberace.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last= Chen |first= David |title= Soderbergh To Direct "Liberace" Biopic, Michael Douglas To Play Lead |url= http://www.slashfilm.com/soderbergh-to-direct-liberace-biopic-michael-douglas-to-play-lead/ |publisher= [[/Film]] |accessdate= June 1, 2013 |date= September 11, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Black Forest Costume Museum''' ({{lang-de|Schwarzwälder Trachtenmuseum}}) is a [[museum]] in the [[convent]] building of the former [[Order of Friars Minor Capuchin|Capuchin]] abbey in [[Haslach im Kinzigtal]] in the Baden-Württemberg county of [[Ortenaukreis]] in south [[Germany]].

The museum was opened in 1980 in the renovated buildings of the [[abbey]]. It portrays the history and development of traditional [[folk costume]] in the [[Black Forest]] and its surrounding regions.

A host of [[traditional costume]] was developed in the Black Forest for farmers as well as for townsfolk. The Black Forest is thus one of the most important regions in Germany for learning about local costume.

== Exhibits ==

The museum houses some of the most important original costumes from the following regions:

* [[Central Black Forest]]
* [[Southern Black Forest]]
* [[Northern Black Forest]] (Foothills on the Upper Rhine Plain)
* Black Forest perimeter
* Ried
* [[Breisgau]]
* [[Markgräflerland]]

Over 100 life-size figures are displayed with many charming details for special occasions and from everyday.

=== Themes ===

* Bonnets and hats, e. g. the ''[[Bollenhut]]''
* [[Bridal crown]]s (''Schäppel'')
* Civic dress
* Work clothing

[[File:Brother jonathan.jpg|thumb|upright|Brother Jonathan in striped pants, somber overcoat, and Lincolnesque stove-pipe hat, as drawn by [[Thomas Nast]].]]

'''Brother Jonathan''' is the [[National personification#Personifications by country or territory|personification]] of [[New England]]. He was also used as an emblem of the USA in general, and can be an [[allegory]] of [[capitalism]]. The catch phrase "Brother Jonathan" came into use when George Washington struggled to provision his armies during the [[American War for Independence]].  When considering the state, or lack of, munitions and supplies, he would state, "We must consult Brother Jonathan" in reference to [[Jonathan Trumbull]], governor of Connecticut—the only British governor who sided with the revolutionaries and who, as a trader and mercantilist, was arranging supplies for the revolutionary armies.&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan Trumbull, Governor of Connecticut, 1769-1784 by Jonathan Trumbull on p. 326. https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=5yBCAAAAIAAJ&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA1&amp;dq=jonathan+trumbull+governor&amp;ots=VF919JKBdx&amp;sig=Z8buRBltMhPFk1S_eqteD1h7RqE#v=onepage&amp;q=debt&amp;f=false&gt; &lt;/ref&gt; "Brother" was a reference to Washington's close friendship with Trumbull. Washington repeated the phrase every time he needed provisions. Ultimately, Jonathan Trumbull indebted himself to a ruinous level ($14,000) in his efforts to secure war supplies. He could only keep the debt collectors at bay until the year before his death. The state of Connecticut was too bankrupt to repay Trumbull.&lt;ref&gt;http://museumofcthistory.org/2015/08/jonathan-trumbull//&lt;/ref&gt; The epithet "Brother Jonathan" was originally one for the USA and not just New England, as described in Jonathan Trumbull's biography (cited above).

Brother Jonathan soon became a stock [[fictional character]], developed as a good-natured parody of all New England during the early American Republic.  He was widely popularized by the weekly newspaper ''[[Brother Jonathan (newspaper)|Brother Jonathan]]'' and the humor magazine ''Yankee Notions.''&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=ZcEcAQAAMAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Yankee+notions&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=AQgXUtebMKi0iQLo54DIDQ&amp;ved=0CCEQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Yankee%20notions&amp;f=false ''Yankee Notions'' in Google Books.]&lt;/ref&gt;  

Brother Jonathan was usually depicted in [[editorial cartoon]]s and [[patriotic]] posters outside New England as a long-winded New Englander who dressed in striped trousers, somber black coat, and stove-pipe hat. Inside New England, "Brother Jonathan" was depicted as an [[Capitalism|enterprising]] and active businessman who blithely boasted of [[Yankee]] conquests for the Universal Yankee Nation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.teachushistory.org/files/brotherjontojohnbull.pdf Teach Us History] - Here, "Brother Jonathan" is clearly a representative of a "Yankee," a New Englander, administering pear-juice to John Bull on behalf of Admiral Perry, during the War of 1812.&lt;/ref&gt;

After 1865, the garb of Brother Jonathan was emulated by [[Uncle Sam]], a common personification of the continental [[American government|government of the United States]].

== History ==
[[File:CanadianAmericaRelationsCartoon1886.gif|thumb|upright|left|"Mrs. Britannia" and her daughter "Miss Canada" discussing whether "Cousin Jonathan" aspires to 'marriage' with Canada, in an 1886 political cartoon about fears of American aspirations to bring Canada into the Union]]

The term dates at least to the 17th century, when it was applied to [[Puritan]] [[roundheads]] during the [[English Civil War]].&lt;ref name="Hart1995"&gt;{{cite book|author=James D. Hart|title=The Oxford Companion to American Literature|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hvmfshZxPf0C&amp;pg=PA91|edition=6th.|date=12 October 1995|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-506548-0|page=91}}&lt;/ref&gt; It came to include residents of colonial New England, who were mostly Puritans in support of the Parliamentarians during the war. It probably is derived from the Biblical words spoken by [[King David|David]] after the death of his friend [[Jonathan (1 Samuel)|Jonathan]], "I am distressed for thee, my brother Jonathan" (2 Samuel 1:26) . As [[Kenneth Hopper]] and [[William Hopper]] put it, "Used as a term of abuse for their ... Puritan opponents by Royalists during the English Civil War, it was applied by British officers to the rebellious colonists during the American Revolution".&lt;ref&gt;Hopper, Kenneth and William, ''The Puritan Gift: Triumph, Collapse and Revival of an American Dream'', I.B.Tauris, 2007, p.63.&lt;/ref&gt;

A popular folk tale about the origin of the term holds that the character is derived from [[Jonathan Trumbull]] (1710–85), Governor of the State of [[Connecticut]], which was the main source of supplies for the Northern and Middle Departments during the [[American Revolutionary War]]. It is said that [[George Washington]] uttered the words, "We must consult Brother Jonathan," when asked how he could win the war.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = Gould, Dudley C | title= Times of Brother Jonathan: What He Ate, Wore, Believed in &amp; Used for Medicine During the War of Independence| publisher = Southfarm Press|year=2001|isbn=978-0-913337-40-0|pages=9–10|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=ZTGZ7ur2t30C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=times+of+brother+jonathan&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=nd_AUPaZE-qs0AGGl4GwBA&amp;ved=0CDAQ6AEwAA&amp;pg=PA9}}&lt;/ref&gt; That origin is doubtful, however, as neither man made reference to the story during his lifetime and the first appearance of the story has been traced to the mid-19th century, long after their deaths.&lt;ref name="OED"&gt;The first printed usage of "Jonathan" as a generic name for a representative Yankee in the Oxford English Dictionary (second edition) is from 1816.&lt;/ref&gt;

The character was adopted by citizens of New England from 1783 to 1815, when Brother Jonathan became a nickname for any [[New England|Yankee]] sailor, similar to the way that [[G.I. (military)|G.I.]] is used to describe members of the U.S. Army.

The term "[[Uncle Sam]]" is thought to date approximately to the [[War of 1812]]. ''Uncle Sam'' appeared in newspapers from 1813 to 1815, and in 1816 he appeared in a book.

The weekly newspaper ''Brother Jonathan'' was first published in 1842, issued out of New York, and it exposed North America to the character named "Brother Jonathan".  ''Yankee Notions, or Whittlings of Jonathan's Jack-Knife'' was a high-quality humor magazine, first published in 1852, that used the stock character to lampoon Yankee acquisitiveness and other peculiarities.  It, too, was issued out of New York, which was a rival with neighboring New England before the Civil war. It was a popular periodical with a large circulation, and people both inside and outside New England enjoyed it as good-natured entertainment.  These jokes were often copied in newspapers as far away as California, where natives encountered Yankee ships and peddlers, inspiring Yankee impersonations in comedy burlesques. ''Brother Jonathan: or, the New Englanders'' was also the title of a book released in three volumes by John Neal.&lt;ref&gt;[http://catalog.hathitrust.org/Record/001692793 Hathi Trust Digital Library]&lt;/ref&gt;  This was published in Edinburgh, illustrating the impact that the crafty New England character had on British literature.

Around the same time, the New England-based [[Know Nothing Party]], which ''Yankee Notions'' also lampooned, was divided into two camps—the moderate Jonathans and the radical Sams.  Eventually, Uncle Sam came to replace Brother Jonathan, and the victors applied "Yankee" to all of the country by the end of the century, after the "Yankee" section had won the [[American Civil War]]. Likewise, "Uncle Sam" was applied to the Federal government.&lt;ref&gt;Note:  Brother Jonathan fought the enemy "John Bull" during the War of 1812; so also did the North again fight ''Johnny'' (for example, [[Johnny Reb]] meant a Confederate soldier). However, the song "[[When Johnny Comes Marching Home]]" was sung on both sides.&lt;/ref&gt;  Uncle Sam came to represent the United States as a whole over the course of the late 19th century, supplanting Brother Jonathan.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/uncle+sam Uncle Sam]", Dictionary.com; accessed 2013.09.18.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to an article in the 1893 ''The Lutheran Witness'', Brother Jonathan and Uncle Sam were different names for the same person:

"When we meet him in politics we call him Uncle Sam; when we meet him in society we call him Brother Jonathan.  Here of late Uncle Sam ''alias'' Brother Jonathan has been doing a powerful lot of complaining, hardly doing anything else." (sic)&lt;ref&gt;December 7, 1893 "A Bit of Advice" ''The Lutheran Witness''  pg 100&lt;/ref&gt;

== Legacy ==

The phrase "We must consult Brother Jonathan" appears on the [[Diploma|graduation certificates]] of [[Yale University]]'s [[Trumbull College]], also named for Trumbull.&lt;ref&gt;[http://trumbull.yalecollege.yale.edu/about/history "Trumbull College History"].&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Code-mixing''' is the mixing of two or more languages or [[Variety (linguistics)|language varieties]] in speech.{{efn|Although this article uses the terms ''speech'' and ''speaking'' following common practice in linguistics, these descriptions apply equally to [[Sign language|signed languages]].}}

Some scholars use the terms "code-mixing" and "[[code-switching]]" interchangeably, especially in studies of [[syntax]], [[Morphology (linguistics)|morphology]], and other [[Formalism (philosophy)|formal]] aspects of language.&lt;ref name="Muysken2000"&gt;Muysken, Pieter. 2000. ''Bilingual Speech: A Typology of Code-mixing''. Cambridge University Press. {{ISBN|0-521-77168-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Bokamba&gt;Bokamba, Eyamba G. 1989. Are there syntactic constraints on code-mixing? World Englishes, 8(3), 277-292.&lt;/ref&gt; Others assume more specific definitions of code-mixing, but these specific definitions may be different in different subfields of [[linguistics]], [[education theory]], [[Communications#Communication as academic discipline|communications]] etc.

Code-mixing is similar to the use or creation of [[pidgin]]s; but while a pidgin is created across groups that do not share a common language, code-mixing may occur within a [[multilingual]] setting where speakers share more than one language.

==As code-switching==
{{main|Code-switching}}
Some linguists use the terms code-mixing and code-switching more or less interchangeably. Especially in formal studies of syntax, morphology, etc., both terms are used to refer to [[utterance]]s that draw from elements of two or more [[Grammar|grammatical systems]].&lt;ref name="Muysken2000"/&gt; These studies are often interested in the alignment of elements from distinct systems, or on constraints that limit switching. 

Some work defines code-mixing as the placing or mixing of various linguistic units (affixes, words, phrases, clauses) from two different grammatical systems within the same sentence and speech context, while code-switching is the placing or mixing of units (words, phrases, sentences) from two codes within the same speech context. The structural difference between code-switching and code-mixing is the position of the altered elements—for code-switching, the modification of the codes occurs intersententially, while for code-mixing, it occurs intrasententially.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=BOKAMBA|first1=Eyamba G.|title=CODE-MIXING, LANGUAGE VARIATION, AND LINGUISTIC THEORY: Evidence from Bantu Languages|journal=Lingua|date=February 1988|volume=76, Issue 1|pages=21-62|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0024384188900174|accessdate=10 October 2017|doi=10.1016/0024-3841(88)90017-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In other work the term code-switching emphasizes a multilingual speaker's movement from one grammatical system to another, while the term code-mixing suggests a hybrid form, drawing from distinct grammars. In other words, ''code-mixing'' emphasizes the formal aspects of language structures or [[linguistic competence]], while ''code-switching'' emphasizes [[linguistic performance]].{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}

While many linguists have worked to describe the difference between code-switching and [[Loanword|borrowing]] of words or phrases, the term code-mixing may be used to encompass both types of language behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|year=2001|first=Shana|last=Poplack|title=Code switching (linguistic)|editors=N. J. Smelser &amp; B. Baltes|encyclopedia=International Encyclopedia of the Social and Behavioral Sciences|pages=2062-2065}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In sociolinguistics==
While linguists who are primarily interested in the structure or form of code-mixing may have relatively little interest to separate code-mixing from code-switching, some sociolinguists have gone to great lengths to differentiate the two phenomena. For these scholars, code-switching is associated with particular [[Pragmatics|pragmatic]] effects, [[discourse]] functions, or associations with group [[Identity (social science)|identity]].{{efn|See especially [[Code-switching#Social motivations|Social motivations for code-switching]].}} In this tradition, the terms ''code-mixing'' or ''language alternation'' are used to describe more stable situations in which multiple languages are used without such pragmatic effects. See also [[#As fused lect|Code-mixing as fused lect]], below.

==In language acquisition==
In studies of bilingual [[language acquisition]], ''code-mixing'' refers to a developmental stage during which children mix elements of more than one language. Nearly all bilingual children go through a period in which they move from one language to another without apparent discrimination.&lt;ref name="King"&gt;King, Kendall A. 2006. "Child language acquisition." In R. Fasold and J. Connor-Linton (eds.) ''An Introduction to Language and Linguistics''. Cambridge University Press. pp. 205-224.&lt;/ref&gt; This differs from code-switching, which is understood as the socially and grammatically appropriate use of multiple varieties.

Beginning at the [[babbling]] stage, young children in bilingual or multilingual environments produce utterances that combine elements of both (or all) of their developing languages. Some linguists suggest that this code-mixing reflects a lack of control or ability to differentiate the languages. Others argue that it is a product of limited vocabulary; very young children may know a word in one language but not in another. More recent studies argue that this early code-mixing is a demonstration of a developing ability to code-switch in socially appropriate ways.&lt;ref name="King"/&gt;

For young bilingual children, code-mixing may be dependent on the linguistic context, cognitive task demands, and interlocutor. Code-mixing may also function to fill gaps in their lexical knowledge. Some forms of code-mixing by young children may indicate risk for [[Language disorder|language impairment]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Greene|first=Kai J |author2=Elizabeth D Peña |author3=Lisa M Bedore|title=Lexical choice and language selection in bilingual preschoolers|journal=Child Language Teaching and Therapy|year=2012|volume=29|issue=1|pages=27–39|doi=10.1177/0265659012459743}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In psychology and psycholinguistics==
In [[psychology]] and in [[psycholinguistics]] the label ''code-mixing'' is used in theories that draw on studies of language alternation or code-switching to describe the cognitive structures underlying bilingualism. During the 1950s and 1960s, psychologists and linguists treated bilingual speakers as, in Grosjean's term, "two monolinguals in one person".&lt;ref name="Grosjean"&gt;Grosjean, Francois. 1989. Neurolinguists, beware! The bilingual is not two monolinguals in one person. Brain language 36(1):3-15.&lt;/ref&gt; This "fractional view" supposed that a bilingual speaker carried two separate mental grammars that were more or less identical to the mental grammars of monolinguals and that were ideally kept separate and used separately. Studies since the 1970s, however, have shown that bilinguals regularly combine elements from "separate" languages. These findings have led to studies of code-mixing in psychology and psycholinguistics.&lt;ref name="Sridhar"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Sridhar | first1 = S.N. | last2 = Sridhar | first2 = Kamal K. | year = 1980 | title = The syntax and psycholinguistics of bilingual code-mixing | url = | journal = Canadian Journal of Psychology | volume = 34 | issue = 4| pages = 407–416 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sridhar and Sridhar define code-mixing as "the transition from using linguistic units (words, phrases, clauses, etc.) of one language to using those of another within a single sentence".&lt;ref name="Sridhar"/&gt; They note that this is distinct from code-switching in that it occurs in a single sentence (sometimes known as ''intrasentential switching'') and in that it does not fulfill the pragmatic or discourse-oriented functions described by sociolinguists. (See [[#In sociolinguistics|Code-mixing in sociolinguistics]], above.) The practice of code-mixing, which draws from competence in two languages at the same time suggests that these competences are not stored or processed separately. Code-mixing among bilinguals is therefore studied in order to explore the mental structures underlying language abilities.

==As fused lect== &lt;!-- [[Code-switching]] links here --&gt;
A ''[[mixed language]]'' or a ''fused lect'' is a relatively stable mixture of two or more languages. What some linguists have described as "codeswitching as unmarked choice"&lt;ref name="Scotton1993"&gt;Myers-Scotton, Carol. 1993. ''Social Motivations of Codeswitching''. Oxford: Clarendon Press.&lt;/ref&gt; or "frequent codeswitching"&lt;ref name="Poplack1979"&gt;Poplack, Shana. 1979. Sometimes I'll start a sentence in Spanish y termino en espanol: toward a typology of code-switching. Linguistics 18(233-234): 581-618.&lt;/ref&gt; has more recently been described as "language mixing", or in the case of the most strictly [[Grammaticalisation|grammaticalized]] forms as "fused lects".&lt;ref name="Auer1999"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Auer | first1 = Peter | year = 1999 | title = From code-switching via language mixing to fused lects: toward a dynamic typology of bilingual speech | url = | journal = International Journal of Bilingualism | volume = 3 | issue = 4| pages = 309–332 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In areas where code-switching among two or more languages is very common, it may become normal for words from both languages to be used together in everyday speech. Unlike code-switching, where a switch tends to occur at [[Semantics|semantically]] or [[Sociolinguistics|sociolinguistically]] meaningful junctures,{{efn|See also [[Contextualization (sociolinguistics)]].}} this code-mixing has no specific meaning in the local context. A fused lect is identical to a mixed language in terms of semantics and pragmatics, but fused lects allow less variation since they are fully grammaticalized. In other words, there are grammatical structures of the fused lect that determine which source-language elements may occur.&lt;ref name="Auer1999"/&gt;

A mixed language is different from a [[creole language]]. Creoles are thought to develop from pidgins as they become [[Nativization|nativized]].&lt;ref&gt;Wardhaugh, Ronald. 2002. "Pidgins and Creoles." In ''An Introduction to Sociolinguistics'' (fourth ed.). Blackwell. pp. 57–86&lt;/ref&gt; Mixed languages develop from situations of code-switching. (See the distinction between code-mixing and pidgin above.)

===Local names===
There are many names for specific mixed languages or fused lects. These names are often used facetiously or carry a [[pejorative]] sense.&lt;ref&gt;Romaine, Suzanne and Braj Kachru. 1992.

'''Contraflow lane reversal''' is the altering of the normal flow of traffic, typically on a [[controlled-access]] highway (such as a freeway or motorway), to either aid in an [[emergency evacuation]] (the most common usage of the term in the [[United States]]) or, as part of [[Planned maintenance|routine maintenance]] activities, to facilitate widening or reconstruction of one of the highway's [[carriageway]]s (the most common usage in the [[United Kingdom]]).

Usually, the term is used to refer to reversal of lanes which are normally configured for travel in one direction; routinely changing the configuration of [[reversible lane#Entire roadway routinely reversed|reversible lanes]] (such as during [[rush hour]]) is not normally considered contraflow lane reversal.

==Emergency evacuation==
In an emergency evacuation, contraflow lane reversal roughly doubles the number of lanes available for evacuation traffic. Crossover sections are used to move outgoing traffic to these lanes. All incoming traffic is blocked until the end of the evacuation.

Contraflow lane reversal is usually done on freeways and other controlled-access roadways; however, some examples listed below (particularly in [[South Carolina]]) are divided and undivided roadways. Use of contraflow lane reversal is generally considered to be an emergency measure, as the contraflow lanes (and any associated ramps at interchanges) lack proper [[traffic sign|signage]], [[traffic signal|signals]], and other traffic control devices needed to orderly conduct traffic in the opposite direction.

Generally, a significant number of police officers or other officials are needed to manually direct traffic during a lane reversal (especially at [[interchange (road)|interchanges]], where ramp traffic in the wrong direction must intersect with other roadways that are operating normally).

===Hurricane evacuation===
[[Image:Hurricane evacuation route marking.JPG|200px|thumb|right|Hurricane evacuation route marking near the Texas Gulf Coast]]
From the 1990s, many states in the [[Southeastern United States]] adopted [[hurricane]] [[Hurricane evacuation route|evacuation routes]] from coastal areas using contraflow lane reversals on [[Interstate Highways]]. State highway departments have coordinated on plans for traffic direction with state [[highway patrol]] agencies, constructed highway median crossovers, and installed signage for drivers and barriers and swing arms to inhibit wrong-way collisions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.floridaits.com/Contraflow_Evac.htm |title=Contraflow Evacuation |publisher=Floridaits.com |date= |accessdate=2008-09-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080922105826/http://www.floridaits.com/Contraflow_Evac.htm |archivedate=2008-09-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most evacuation plans involve only a single state; however, the states of [[Louisiana]] and [[Mississippi]] have developed coordinated plans to evacuate the [[New Orleans metropolitan area]] by using [[Interstate 55]] and [[Interstate 59]].

Current contraflow evacuation plans exist for:

==Highway reconstruction==
When roads are undergoing [[Roadworks|construction]] amid heavy traffic, one lane of traffic may be blocked and another lane reversed.

===Single track roads===
[[Single track road]]s are often closed during reconstruction.

===Two-lane arterials===
[[File:Contraflow traffic through roundabout on North Beach Road.ogv|thumb|right|Traffic controllers direct traffic through half of a roundabout with STOP / SLOW signs, using contraflow conditions]]
A [[construction worker]] or [[police officer]] directs traffic with a "Stop/Slow Paddle", which is a sign displaying "STOP" on one side and "SLOW" on the other. The sign is turned, and the other side proceeds. [[Traffic signal]]s are also sometimes used, especially during bridge construction or any situation in which a lane must be closed during times when construction crews are not at work. Other cases include treating the street as a temporary one-way street in areas in which several nearby parallel streets are available as a detour for the opposing side.

===Roads with four or more lanes===
If road construction necessitates the complete closure of one half of a road with four or more lanes, two lanes of traffic may be shifted to the other roadway. If the road being constructed is a highway, the used half is called a [[semi-highway]].

===Freeways and motorways===

{{Main|Semi-highway}}
When [[controlled-access highway]]s undergo reconstruction, both sides are often reduced to one lane. In some cases, traffic may be shifted onto one half, making it a temporary [[two-lane freeway]] corridor. An example of this is [[Interstate 10]] in [[Arizona]], in which eastbound traffic is reduced to one lane and shifted onto the westbound half of the road.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://maps.google.com/?ie=UTF8&amp;z=17&amp;ll=33.630566,-114.41146&amp;spn=0.004315,0.008347&amp;t=k&amp;om=1 |title=Google Maps |publisher=Maps.google.com |date= |accessdate=2008-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Another technique is to treat the rightmost [[hard shoulder]] as a travel lane. On a six-lane freeway (i.e., one containing three lanes in each direction), a third lane may be kept open for the busier direction, or the shoulder may be opened to allow for four lanes of traffic but with little or no shoulder space; emergency breakdown areas may be added. In these situations, temporary "YIELD" or "STOP" signs are usually posted on merge ramps on freeways, expressways, and uncontrolled roads with interchanges. In such cases, opposing directions are separated by [[jersey barrier]]s, or in rare circumstances, [[traffic cone]]s.

==Sporting events==
At the beginning and end of major sporting events, the center turn lanes of roads around a stadium or arena may be used to accommodate event traffic. Because these lanes are typically not subject to lane control, this can be considered a limited form of contraflow reversal.
[[Image:I-93ContraflowLaneReversalConcordNH.jpg|275px|thumb|right|Contraflow lane reversal in operation on [[Interstate 93|I-93]] in [[Concord, New Hampshire]] after completion of a [[NASCAR]] [[2013 Camping World RV Sales 301|race]] at [[New Hampshire Motor Speedway]], looking south.]]

Twice annually, upon completion of [[NASCAR]] races at [[New Hampshire Motor Speedway]] in [[Loudon, New Hampshire]], a form of contraflow lane reversal, referred to as "borrow a lane" is conducted on [[Interstate 93]] in [[Concord, New Hampshire]]. In this case, the left lane of northbound Interstate 93 is temporarily "borrowed" to use as a third southbound lane. Southbound traffic has the option of transferring to the "borrowed" lane north of the [[Interstate 393]] interchange and can travel southbound in the left northbound lane to allow a bypass of heavy race traffic entering I-93 southbound from I-393 at Exit 15. The two lanes of traffic in the normal southbound lanes, and traffic in the bypass "borrowed" lane rejoin on the southbound side of the interstate just south of the [[Interstate 89]] interchange in [[Bow, New Hampshire|Bow]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nh.gov/dot/media/nr2013/20130708-nascar-traffic-controls.htm |title=Traffic Control Plans for the July 14 NASCAR Race at New Hampshire Motor Speedway in Loudon |publisher=NHDOT |date= |accessdate=2013-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Contraflow lane reversal is also used for [[Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series]] and [[IndyCar Series]] races at [[Pocono Raceway]] in [[Long Pond, Pennsylvania]]. For these races, two-lane [[Pennsylvania Route 115]] becomes one-way southbound between [[Interstate 80 in Pennsylvania|Interstate 80]] and the track the morning of the race until everyone has arrived at the track. After the race concludes, PA 115 becomes one-way northbound between Pocono Raceway and I-80 until everyone has left the track.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Staff|title=Special traffic patterns planned for Pocono race|publisher=WFMZ-TV|location=Allentown, PA|date=July 29, 2014|url=http://www.wfmz.com/news/Regional-Poconos-Coal/Local/special-traffic-patterns-planned-for-pocono-race/27202978|accessdate=2014-09-21|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150623003052/http://www.wfmz.com/news/Regional-Poconos-Coal/Local/special-traffic-patterns-planned-for-pocono-race/27202978|archive-date=2015-06-23|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Staff|title=Special traffic patterns planned for Pocono race|publisher=WFMZ-TV|location=Allentown, PA|date=June 30, 2014|url=http://www.wfmz.com/news/Regional-Poconos-Coal/Local/special-traffic-patterns-planned-for-pocono-race/26729224|accessdate=2014-09-21|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150623015430/http://www.wfmz.com/news/Regional-Poconos-Coal/Local/special-traffic-patterns-planned-for-pocono-race/26729224|archive-date=2015-06-23|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In literature and drama, the term '''everyman''' has come to mean an ordinary individual&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wordnetweb.princeton.edu/perl/webwn?s=everyman|title=WordNet Search - 3.0|publisher=[[Princeton University]]|accessdate=August 30, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Merriam-Webster"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/everyman|title=Everyman - Definition and More From the Free Merriam-Webster Dictionary|publisher=[[Merriam-Webster]]|accessdate=August 30, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; with whom the audience or reader is supposed to be able to identify easily and who is often placed in extraordinary circumstances.

==Description==
The name derives from a 15th-century [[England|English]] [[morality play]] called ''[[Everyman (play)|Everyman]]''.&lt;ref name="Merriam-Webster"/&gt;

The contemporary everyman differs from his (or her) medieval counterpart in many respects. While the medieval everyman was devoid of definite marks of individuality in order to create a universality in the moral message of the play, the contemporary storyteller may use an everyman for amoral, immoral, or demonstrative purposes.{{citation needed|date=October 2012}}

==Uses==
{{Unreferenced section|date=July 2013}}
The everyman character is constructed so that the audience can imagine themselves in the same situation without having to possess knowledge, skills, or abilities that transcend human potential. Such characters react realistically in situations that are often taken for granted with traditional heroes.

Alternatively, an everyman occupies the role of [[protagonist]] without being a "[[hero]]" and without necessarily being a [[round character]] or a [[dynamic character]]. In this scenario, the everyman is developed like a secondary character, but the character's near omnipresence within the narrative shifts the focus from character development to events and story lines surrounding the character. Some audiences or readers may project themselves into this character, if no dominant characteristic of the everyman prevents them from doing so. Others may ignore the character and concentrate on the story arc, the visual imagery, the irony or satire, and any other aspect of the story which the orchestrator(s) of the story have focused upon or, indeed, whatever personally interests the reader.{{citation needed|date=October 2012}}

An everyman character may occasionally be used as a narrator for the action, or to gloss over or fill in temporal gaps in the flow of a story. This allows for the presence of narrators without drawing attention to their role, by having a character commentating on events from within the dramatic action rather than separate from it. When employed in this way, the everyman character may by necessity have to break the convention of the [[fourth wall]], speaking directly to the audience. Examples of this role would include the character of Ché in the musical ''[[Evita (musical)|Evita]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Miller, S., [http://www.newlinetheatre.com/evitachapter.html Inside ''Evita'' – background and analysis]"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gans, A. "[http://www.playbill.com/news/article/159561-In-Upcoming-Revival-of-Evita-Che-Will-Be-The-Everyman-Not-Che-Guevara In upcoming revival of ''Evita'', Che will be the "everyman", not Che Guevara]," ''Playbill,'' February 10, 2012. Retrieved January 18, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Rice &amp; Barton's Big Gaiety Spectacular Extravaganza Co.  - Gaiety Dancers.png|thumb|A poster showing the [[chorus line|chorus girls]] of a 1900 extravaganza.]]
An '''extravaganza''' is a literary or musical work (often [[musical theatre]]) characterized by freedom of style and structure and usually containing elements of [[Victorian burlesque|burlesque]], [[pantomime]], [[music hall]] and parody. It sometimes also has elements of cabaret, circus, [[revue]], variety, [[vaudeville]] and [[mime]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/topic-199143/extravaganza |title=Encyclopædia Britannica online |publisher=Britannica.com |date= |accessdate=2014-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;  ''Extravaganza'' may more broadly refer to an elaborate, spectacular, and expensive theatrical production.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Ewen, David|title=Panorama of American Popular Music|publisher=Prentice Hall|year=1957}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term was widely used to describe a type of 19th-century British drama made popular by [[James Planché]].  Planché defined it as "the whimsical treatment of a poetical subject."&lt;ref&gt;Planché.  ''The recollections and reflections of J.R. Planché (Somerset herald): a professional biography'' (1872), Vol. II, p. 43&lt;/ref&gt;

The term is derived from the Italian word ''stravaganza'', meaning extravagance.

[[File:Cat guarding geese c1120 BC Egypt.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Anthropomorphism|Anthropomorphic]] cat guarding geese, Egypt, ca. 1120 [[BCE]]]]
'''Fable''' is a literary genre: a succinct [[fiction|fictional]] story, in [[prose]] or [[verse (poetry)|verse]], that features [[animal]]s, [[legendary creature]]s, [[plant]]s, inanimate objects, or forces of nature that are [[Anthropomorphism|anthropomorphized]] (given human qualities, such as the ability to speak [[human language]]) and that illustrates or leads to a particular [[moral]] lesson (a "moral"), which may at the end be added explicitly as a pithy [[maxim (philosophy)|maxim]]&lt;!-- ''most'' of this page is too specific to serve as the only target --&gt; or [[saying]]&lt;!-- this is too much of a compendium to serve as the only target --&gt;.

A fable differs from a [[parable]] in that the latter ''excludes'' animals, plants, inanimate objects, and forces of nature as actors that assume speech or other powers of humankind.

Usage has not always been so clearly distinguished. In the [[King James Version]] of the [[New Testament]], "{{lang|grc|μῦθος}}" ("''[[mythos]]''") was rendered by the [[Translation|translators]] as "fable"&lt;ref&gt;For example, in ''[[First Epistle to Timothy|First Timothy]]'', "neither give heed to fables...", and "refuse profane and old wives' fables..." (1 Tim 1:4 and 4:4, respectively).&lt;/ref&gt; in the [[First Epistle to Timothy]], the [[Second Epistle to Timothy]], the [[Epistle to Titus]] and the [[First Epistle of Peter]].&lt;ref&gt;
Strong's 3454. μύθος muthos moo’-thos; perhaps from the same as 3453 (through the idea of tuition); a tale, i.e. &lt;U&gt;fiction&lt;/U&gt; ("myth"):—fable.&lt;br /&gt;"For we have not followed cunningly devised fables, when we made known unto you the power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, but were eyewitnesses of his majesty." (2nd Peter 1:16)&lt;/ref&gt;

A person who writes fables is a '''fabulist'''.

==History==
The fable is one of the most enduring forms of [[folklore|folk literature]], spread abroad, modern researchers agree,&lt;ref&gt;''Enzyklopädie des Märchens'' (1977), see "Fabel", "Äsopica" etc.&lt;/ref&gt; less by literary anthologies than by oral transmission. Fables can be found in the literature of almost every country.

===Aesopic or Aesop's fable===
The varying corpus denoted ''Aesopica'' or ''[[Aesop's Fables]]'' includes most of the best-known western fables, which are attributed to the [[legend]]ary [[Aesop]], supposed to have been a slave in [[ancient Greece]] around 550 BCE. When [[Babrius]] set down fables from the ''Aesopica'' in verse for a [[Hellenistic]] Prince "Alexander," he expressly stated at the head of Book II that this type of "myth" that Aesop had introduced to the "sons of the Hellenes" had been an invention of "Syrians" from the time of "[[Ninus|Ninos]]" (personifying [[Nineveh]] to Greeks) and [[Belus (Assyrian)|Belos]] ("ruler").&lt;ref&gt;Burkert 1992:121&lt;/ref&gt; [[Epicharmus of Kos]] and Phormis are reported as having been among the first to invent comic fables.&lt;ref&gt;P. W. Buckham, p. 245&lt;/ref&gt; Many familiar fables of Aesop include "[[The Crow and the Pitcher]]", "[[The Tortoise and the Hare]]" and "[[The Lion and the Mouse]]". In ancient Greek and Roman education, the fable was the first of the ''[[progymnasmata]]''—training exercises in prose composition and public speaking—wherein students would be asked to learn fables, expand upon them, invent their own, and finally use them as persuasive examples in longer forensic or deliberative speeches. The need of instructors to teach, and students to learn, a wide range of fables as material for their declamations resulted in their being gathered together in collections, like those of Aesop.

===Africa===
[[Oral tradition|African oral culture]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/atim-oton/arits-fables-kids-series_b_1001656.html |author=Atim Oton |title=Reaching African Children Through Fables and Animation |publisher=Huffingtonpost.com |date=October 25, 2011 |accessdate=May 8, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; has a rich story-telling tradition. As they have for thousands of years, people of all ages in Africa continue to interact with nature, including plants, animals and earthly structures such as rivers, plains, and mountains. Grandparents enjoy enormous respect in African societies and fill the new role of story-telling during retirement years. Children and, to some extent, adults are mesmerized by good story-tellers when they become animated in their quest to tell a good fable.

[[Joel Chandler Harris]] wrote African-American fables in the Southern context of slavery under the name of [[Uncle Remus]]. His stories of the animal characters Brer Rabbit, Brer Fox, and Brer Bear are modern examples of African-American story-telling, this though should not transcend critiques and controversies as to whether or not Uncle Remus was a racist or apologist for slavery. The Disney movie ''[[Song of the South]]'' introduced many of the stories to the public and others not familiar with the role that storytelling played in the life of cultures and groups without training in speaking, reading, writing, or the cultures to which they had been relocated to from world practices of capturing Africans and other indigenous populations to provide slave labor to colonized countries.

===India===
India has a rich tradition of fabulous novels, mostly explainable by the fact that the culture derives traditions and learns qualities from natural elements. Most of the gods are some form of animals with ideal qualities. Also, hundreds of fables were composed in [[History of India|ancient India]] during the [[1st millennium BC|first millennium BCE]], often as [[Story within a story|stories within]] [[frame story|frame stories]]. Indian fables have a mixed cast of humans and animals. The dialogues are often longer than in fables of Aesop and often witty as the animals try to outwit one another by trickery and deceit. In Indian fables, man is not superior to the animals. The tales are often comical. The Indian fable adhered to the universally known traditions of the fable. The best examples of the fable in India are the Panchatantra and the [[Jataka tales]]. These included [[Vishnu Sarma]]'s ''[[Panchatantra]]'', the ''[[Hitopadesha]]'', ''[[Baital Pachisi|Vikram and The Vampire]]'', and [[Syntipas]]' ''[[Seven Wise Masters]]'', which were collections of fables that were later influential throughout the [[Old World]]. Ben E. Perry (compiler of the "[[Perry Index]]" of Aesop's fables) has argued controversially that some of the Buddhist ''Jataka tales'' and some of the fables in the ''Panchatantra'' may have been influenced by similar [[Greek language|Greek]] and [[Near East]]ern ones.&lt;ref&gt;Ben E. Perry, "Introduction", p. xix, in ''Babrius and Phaedrus'' (1965)&lt;/ref&gt; Earlier [[Indian epic poetry|Indian epics]] such as [[Krishna Dwaipayana Vyasa|Vyasa's]] ''[[Mahabharata]]'' and [[Valmiki]]'s ''[[Ramayana]]'' also contained fables within the main story, often as [[side story|side stories]] or [[back-story]]. The most famous folk stories from the Near East were the ''[[One Thousand and One Nights]]'', also known as the ''Arabian Nights''.

===Europe===
Fables had a further long tradition through the [[Middle Ages]], and became part of European high literature. During the 17th century, the [[France|French]] fabulist [[Jean de La Fontaine]] (1621–1695) saw the soul of the fable in the moral — a rule of behavior. Starting with the Aesopian pattern, La Fontaine set out to satirize the court, the church, the rising [[bourgeoisie]], indeed the entire human scene of his time.&lt;ref&gt;Translations of his 12 books of fables are available online at [http://oaks.nvg.org/fontaine.html oaks.nvg.org]&lt;/ref&gt; La Fontaine's model was subsequently emulated by England's [[John Gay]] (1685–1732);&lt;ref&gt;His two collections of 1727 and 1738 are available in one volume on Google Books at [https://books.google.com/books?id=X_Y0AAAAMAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=john+gay+++%22fables%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=_ChY5dZunN&amp;sig=5qBAeejDOY8U5EgxDr4Pgnw68ao&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=EcNNTLKfGpL24AbX5uCaDA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=7&amp;ved=0CCsQ6AEwBjgK#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false books.google.co.uk]&lt;/ref&gt; Poland's [[Ignacy Krasicki]] (1735–1801);&lt;ref&gt;His ''Bajki przypowiesci'' (Fables &amp; Parables, 1779) are available online at [http://literat.ug.edu.pl/ikbajk/index.htm ug.edu.pl]&lt;/ref&gt; Italy's [[:it:Lorenzo Pignotti|Lorenzo Pignotti]] (1739–1812)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6CSQZlaZjE0C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=pignotti+++favola&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=n8Mlm8LQld&amp;sig=ubnkrD47WARSbDJKUXgNCj7_Vgo&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=8DhNTP-rOt3NjAeEtLDYDA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CBUQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=His '&amp;#39;Favole e Novelle'&amp;#39; (1785) is available on Google Books |publisher=Books.google.co.uk |date= |accessdate=May 8, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Verify source|date=May 2012}} and [[:it:Giovanni Gherardo de Rossi|Giovanni Gherardo de Rossi]] (1754–1827);&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rKoTAAAAQAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=pignotti+++favola&amp;source=gbs_similarbooks_s&amp;cad=1#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=His '&amp;#39;Favole'&amp;#39; (1788) is available on Google Books |publisher=Books.google.co.uk |date= |accessdate=May 8, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Verify source|date=May 2012}} Serbia's [[Dositej Obradović]] (1739–1811); Spain's [[Félix María de Samaniego]] (1745–1801)&lt;ref&gt;9 books of fables are available online in Spanish at [http://amediavoz.com/samaniego.htm amediavoz.com]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Tomás de Iriarte y Oropesa]] (1750–1791);&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Zr0DAAAAQAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Tom%C3%A1s+de+Iriarte+y+Oropesa+fabulas&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=WbHNxf22GV&amp;sig=zrfOpn4x0K8bAykQBwrXmq_zHfQ&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=mElNTMGZO5mW4gbNyLCaDA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=4&amp;ved=0CCUQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=His '&amp;#39;Fabulas Literarias'&amp;#39; are available on Google Books |publisher=Books.google.co.uk |date= |accessdate=May 8, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Verify source|date=May 2012}} France's [[Jean-Pierre Claris de Florian]] (1755–94);&lt;ref&gt;His five books of fables are available online in French at [http://www.shanaweb.net/florian/la-vie-de-florian.htm shanaweb.net] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100612144726/http://shanaweb.net/florian/la-vie-de-florian.htm |date=2010-06-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and Russia's [[Ivan Krylov]] (1769–1844).&lt;ref&gt;5 books of fables are available online in Russian at [http://www.friends-partners.org/friends/literature/19century/krylov2.html friends-partners.org]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modern era===
In modern times, while the fable has been trivialized in children's books, it has also been fully adapted to modern adult literature. [[Felix Salten]]'s ''[[Bambi, A Life in the Woods|Bambi]]'' (1923) is a ''[[Bildungsroman]]'' — a story of a [[protagonist]]'s coming-of-age — cast in the form of a fable. [[James Thurber]] used the ancient fable style in his books ''[[Fables for Our Time and Famous Poems Illustrated|Fables for Our Time]]'' (1940) and ''[[Further Fables for Our Time]]'' (1956), and in his stories "[[The Princess and the Tin Box]]" in ''The Beast in Me and Other Animals'' (1948) and "The Last Clock: A Fable for the Time, Such As It Is, of Man" in ''Lanterns and Lances'' (1961). [[Władysław Reymont]]'s ''The Revolt'' (1922), a [[metaphor]] for the [[Bolshevik]] [[Russian Revolution of 1917|Revolution of 1917]], described a revolt by animals that take over their farm in order to introduce "equality." [[George Orwell]]'s ''[[Animal Farm]]'' (1945) similarly satirized [[Stalinist Communism]] in particular, and [[totalitarianism]] in general, in the guise of animal fable.

In the 21st century, the Neapolitan writer Sabatino Scia is the author of more than two hundred fables that he describes as “western protest fables.” The characters are not only animals, but also things, beings, and elements from nature. Scia’s aim is the same as in the traditional fable, playing the role of revealer of human society. In Latin America, the brothers Juan and Victor Ataucuri Garcia have contributed to the resurgence of the fable. But they do so with a novel idea: use the fable as a means of dissemination of traditional literature of that place. In the book ''[http://www.childrenslibrary.org/icdl/BookPreview?bookid=atafabu_00510018&amp;route=author_Spanish&amp;lang=Spanish&amp;msg&amp;ilang=Spanish "Fábulas Peruanas"] published in 2003, they have collected myths, legends, beliefs of Andean and Amazonian Peru, to write as fables. The result has been an extraordinary work rich in regional nuances. Here we discover the relationship between man and his origin, with nature, with its history, its customs and beliefs then become norms and values.&lt;ref&gt;Juan y Víctor Ataucuri García, "Fábulas Peruanas", Gaviota Azul Editores, Lima, 2003 {{ISBN|9972-2561-0-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6321">In [[artificial intelligence]] and in heuristic [[decision-making]], a '''fast-and-frugal tree''' is a type of [[classification tree]]. Fast-and-frugal trees can be used as  decision-making tools which operate as lexicographic classifiers, and, if required, associate an action (decision) to each class or category.&lt;ref name=naive&gt;Martignon, Laura; Vitouch, Oliver; Takezawa, Masanori; Forster, Malcolm. [https://www.researchgate.net/publication/27278577_Naive_and_Yet_Enlightened_From_Natural_Frequencies_to_Fast_and_Frugal_Decision_Trees "Naive and Yet Enlightened: From Natural Frequencies to Fast and Frugal Decision Trees"], published in ''Thinking : Psychological perspectives on reasoning, judgement and decision making'' (David Hardman and Laura Macchi; editors), Chichester: John Wiley &amp; Sons, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; The original fast-and-frugal trees introduced in 2003 by [[Laura Martignon]], et al. are simple both in execution and in construction, and constitute a kind of simple [[heuristic]] in the adaptive toolbox postulated by [[Gerd Gigerenzer]] and the Center for Adaptive Behavior and Cognition.&lt;ref name=naive /&gt; Similar models had been previously used by Martignon &amp; Hoffrage, 1999; Green and Mehr, 1997  {{ran|GM}}; Dhami and Ayton, 2001 {{ran|DA}}; Dhami and Harries, 2001 {{ran|DH}} and Fischer, Steiner, Zucol, Berger, Martignon, et al. 2002 {{ran|FZBM}}. 

Yet recent developments in several fields of application have maintained the simplicity in execution, introducing subtle, relevant  procedures for construction that have proven extremely useful for users.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21381858 ''Luan, Sheng Hua, Schooler, Lael &amp; Gigerenzer Gerd Psychol Rev.''] 2011 Apr;118(2):316-38. doi: 10.1037/a0022684. A signal-detection analysis of fast-and-frugal trees. Luan, S.; Schooler, LJ; Gigerenzer, G.&lt;/ref&gt;

== How a fast-and-frugal tree works ==
The basic elements on which to ground a binary classification are (sets of) cues.  The fast-and-frugal tree establishes a ranking and, according to the ranking, a “topology” of the tree. Once the ranking is established, the fast-and-frugal tree checks one cue at a time, and at each step, one of the possible outcomes of the considered cue is an exit node which allows for a decision.

Fast-and-frugal trees can also be described in terms of their building blocks. First, they have a search rule: They inspect cues in a specific order. Second, they have a stopping rule: Each cue has one value that leads to an exit node and hence to a classification, and another value that leads to consulting the next cue in the cue hierarchy (the exception being the last cue in the hierarchy, which has two exit nodes). Finally, they have a classification rule.  

[[File:Fast-and-Frugal-Tree.jpg|alt=Example of Fast-and-Frugal Tree|thumb|410x410px|Figure 1: An example of Fast-and-Frugal Tree]]
Figure 1 illustrates a fast-and-frugal tree for classifying a patient as “high risk” of having a heart stroke and thus having to be sent to the “coronary care unit” or “low risk” and thus having to be sent to a “regular nursing bed {{ran|GM}} (Green&amp; Mehr, 1997). 
Fast-and-frugal trees have been characterized mathematically as lexicographic classifiers (Martignon, Katsikopoulos and Woike, 2008) and as linear classifiers with non-compensatory weights (Martignon, Katsikopoulos and Woike, 2008) {{ran|MKW}}. Their “topology” and construction has been analysed using signal detection theory (Luan, Schooler and Gigerenzer, 2011) {{ran|LSG}} and their performance and robustness when compared to regression and CARts has been studied by Laskey and Martignon (2014){{ran|LM}}. An extensive study on the robustness, the predictive value and sensitivity/specificity of Fast-And-Frugal trees compared to those of [[Naive Bayes]] and of Full Natural Frequency Trees has been carried out by{{ran|WHM}}.

In 2017, Phillips, Neth, Woike and Gaissmaier {{ran|PNWG}} introduced the R package [https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=FFTrees FFTrees], which uses new algorithms to construct and evaluate FFTs. A simulation study across ten real-world data sets shows that FFTs created by FFTrees can predict data as well as more complex classification algorithms, while remaining simple enough for anyone to understand and use.

The '''Ghent-Bruges School''' is a manner or movement of [[Illuminated manuscript|manuscript illumination]] from about 1475 to about 1550 that developed in southern Netherlands, now Belgium. The term was first used in 1891 by Joseph Destree, author of ''Recherches sur les elumineurs flamands'' and art historian [[Paul Durrieu]].&lt;ref name="Turner p. 118"&gt;Jane Turner. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=6BIXXNwEOv8C&amp;pg=PA118 The Grove Dictionary of Art: From renaissance to impressionism : styles and movements in western art 1400-1900]''. St. Martin's Press; 2000. {{ISBN|978-0-312-22975-7}}. p. 118.&lt;/ref&gt;

It replaced the "courtly style" of about 1440 to 1474 during the southern Netherlands reigns of [[Philip the Good]] and [[Charles the Bold]]. That mid-15th-century style consisted of works in primary colors of "wooden, clumsily painted stock figures".&lt;ref name="Turner p. 118" /&gt; 

The Ghent-Bruges School style created illuminated manuscripts with realistic images of people, including half- and full-length portraits, colorful landscapes and the use of bright and pastel colors.&lt;ref name="Turner p. 118" /&gt;

'''''Half-Life''''' (stylized as '''''HλLF-LIFE''''') is a [[first-person shooter]] video game developed by [[Valve Corporation|Valve]] and published by [[Sierra Entertainment|Sierra Studios]] for [[Microsoft Windows]] in 1998. It was Valve's debut product and the first in the [[Half-Life (series)|''Half-Life'' series]]. Players assume the role of [[Gordon Freeman|Dr. Gordon Freeman]], who must fight his way out of the Black Mesa research facility after an experiment goes  wrong, fighting enemies and solving puzzles.

Unlike many other games at the time, the player has almost complete uninterrupted control of Freeman, and the story is told mostly through [[scripted sequence]]s seen through his eyes. Valve co-founder [[Gabe Newell]] said the team aimed to create an immersive world rather than a "shooting gallery". The game's [[Game engine|engine]], [[GoldSrc]], is a heavily modified version of the [[Quake engine|''Quake'' engine]] licensed from [[id Software]].

''Half-Life'' received acclaim for its graphics, realistic gameplay, and seamless narrative. It won over fifty PC "Game of the Year" awards and is considered one of the [[List of video games considered the best|greatest video games of all time]].&lt;ref name=gamasutra&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamasutra.com/features/20060901/quantum_01.shtml |title=The Gamasutra Quantum Leap Awards: First-Person Shooters |accessdate=September 3, 2006|website=Gamasutra|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130511073515/http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/130249/the_gamasutra_quantum_leap_awards_.php?print=1 |archivedate=May 11, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It influenced first-person shooters for years after its release.

''Half-Life'' had sold eight million copies {{As of|2004|11|16|alt=by November 16, 2004}}, and 9.3 million copies by December 2008. It was [[Porting|ported]] to the [[PlayStation 2]] in 2001, and [[OS X]] and [[Linux]] in 2013. It was followed in 2004 by ''[[Half-Life 2]]''.

== Gameplay ==
[[File:halflife ingame.jpg|thumb|left|In this scene, the player must bypass a dam reservoir guarded by an [[Boeing AH-64 Apache|Apache helicopter]], a group of [[United States Marine Corps|marines]], and a cannon emplacement.]]

''Half-Life'' is a first-person shooter that requires the player to perform combat tasks and puzzle solving to advance through the game. Unlike most of its peers at the time, ''Half-Life'' used scripted sequences, such as a [[Vortigaunt]] ramming down a door, to advance major plot points. Compared to most first-person shooters of the time, which relied on [[cutscene|cut-scene intermissions]] to detail their plotlines, ''Half-Life''{{'}}s story is told mostly by means of scripted sequences (bar one short cutscene), keeping the player in control of the [[first-person (video games)|first-person viewpoint]]. In line with this the player rarely loses the ability to control [[Gordon Freeman|Gordon]], who never speaks and is never actually seen in the game; the player sees "through his eyes" for the entire length of the game. ''Half-Life'' has no "levels"; it instead divides the game into chapters, whose titles flash on the screen as the player moves through the game. Progress through the world is continuous, except for short pauses for loading.&lt;ref name="game guide"&gt;{{cite book|title=Half-Life : Prima's Official Strategy Guide |author=Bell, Joe Grant |date=November 25, 1998 |publisher=[[Prima Games]] |isbn=0-7615-1360-4 |url=https://www.amazon.com/Half-Life-Primas-Official-Strategy-Guide/dp/0761513604 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070330015424/http://www.amazon.com/Half-Life-Primas-Official-Strategy-Guide/dp/0761513604 |archivedate=March 30, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The game regularly integrates puzzles, such as navigating a maze of conveyor belts or using nearby boxes to build a small staircase to the next area the player must travel to. Some puzzles involve using the environment to kill an enemy, like turning on a steam valve to spray hot steam at their enemies. There are few "bosses" in the conventional sense, where the player defeats a superior opponent by direct confrontation. Instead, such organisms occasionally define chapters, and the player is generally expected to use the terrain, rather than firepower, to kill the "boss". Late in the game, the player receives a "long jump module" for the [[HEV suit]], which allows the player to increase the horizontal distance and speed of jumps by crouching before jumping. The player must rely on this ability to navigate various platformer-style [[jumping puzzles]] in [[Xen (Half-Life)|Xen]] toward the end of the game.&lt;ref name="game guide" /&gt;

For the most part the player battles through the game alone, but is occasionally assisted by non-player characters; specifically security guards and scientists who help the player; the guards will fight alongside the player, and both guards and scientists can assist in reaching new areas and impart relevant plot information. A wide array of alien enemies populate the game, including [[headcrab]]s, [[Creatures in the Half-Life series|bullsquids]], [[Headcrab#Headcrab zombie|headcrab zombies]], and [[Vortigaunt]]s. The player also faces human opponents, in particular, Hazardous Environment Combat Unit (HECU) Marines and black ops assassins who are dispatched to contain the extra-dimensional threats and silence all witnesses.

== Synopsis ==

=== Setting ===
Most of the game is set in a remote desert area of [[New Mexico]] in the [[Black Mesa Research Facility]], a fictional complex that bears many similarities to both the [[Los Alamos National Laboratory]] and [[Area 51]], &lt;!-- Don't add speculation as to the actual day, the game's manual states that Freeman merely begins work on May 15, not that the game is actually on May 15. --&gt; at some point during the 2000s. The game's protagonist is the [[theoretical physics|theoretical physicist]] [[Gordon Freeman]], who holds a [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] from [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]]. Freeman becomes one of the survivors of an experiment at Black Mesa that goes horribly wrong, when an unexpected "resonance cascade"—a fictitious phenomenon—rips [[dimension]]al seams, devastating the facility. Aliens from the [[Xen (Half-Life)|Xen]] dimension subsequently enter the facility through these dimensional seams (an event known as the "Black Mesa Incident").&lt;ref name="game guide" /&gt;

As Freeman tries to make his way out of the ruined facility, he soon discovers that he is caught between two sides: the hostile aliens and the [[Hazardous Environment Combat Unit]], a [[U.S. Marine Corps]] [[U.S. special operations forces|special operations]] unit dispatched to eliminate the organisms and the other surviving Black Mesa personnel including Dr. Freeman to cover up the incident or destroy all contamination. Throughout the game, a mysterious figure known (but not actually referred to in-game) as the "[[G-Man (Half-Life)|G-Man]]" regularly appears and seems to be monitoring Freeman's progress. Ultimately, Freeman uses the cooperation of surviving scientists and security officers to work his way towards the mysterious "Lambda Complex" of Black Mesa (signified with the Greek lambda character "[[Lambda|λ]]"), where a team of survivors teleports him to the alien world Xen to kill the Nihilanth, the gigantic entity keeping Xen's side of the dimensional rift open.&lt;ref name="game guide" /&gt;

The game's plot was originally inspired by the [[video game]]s ''[[Doom (1993 video game)|Doom]]'' and ''[[Quake (video game)|Quake]]'' (both [[PC game]]s produced by [[id Software]]), [[Stephen King]]'s [[short story]]/[[novella]] ''[[The Mist]]'', and an episode of ''[[The Outer Limits (1963 TV series)|The Outer Limits]]'' called "[[The Borderland]]".&lt;ref name="raisebar"&gt;{{cite book | author = Hodgson, David | year = 2004 | title = Half-Life 2: Raising the Bar | publisher = Prima Games | isbn = 0-7615-4364-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was later developed by Valve's in-house writer and author, [[Marc Laidlaw]], who wrote the books ''[[Dad's Nuke]]'' and ''[[The 37th Mandala]]''.

=== Plot ===
Physicist Gordon Freeman arrives late for work at the Black Mesa Research Facility. He dons his Hazardous Environment (HEV) suit to carry out an experiment taking place in the Anomalous Materials of Sector C of the facility. When he pushes an unusual material into an anti-mass spectrometer for analysis, the spectrometer explodes, creating a "resonance cascade" that opens a portal to another dimension, [[Xen (Half-Life)|Xen]].

Gordon escapes the destroyed lab. Survivors tell him that communications with the outside world have been cut and urge him to head to the surface. Gordon fights his way through Black Mesa, defending himself against hostile Xen creatures — such as [[Vortigaunts]] and parasitic [[headcrab]]s, which attach themselves to human hosts — and US Marines sent to [[Cover-up|cover up]] the incident. 

On the surface, Gordon learns that scientists from the Lambda Complex may have found a way to close the portal. Gordon travels to the other end of the facility to assist them. Along the way, he activates a [[rocket engine test facility]] to destroy a giant [[Creatures in the Half-Life series#Tentacle|tentacled creature]] and uses a disused railway system to reach and launch a satellite rocket. After he is captured by marines and left for dead in a garbage compactor, he escapes and makes his way to an older part of the facility, where he discovers Xen specimens collected before the resonance cascade.

Overwhelmed by the aliens, the marines pull out of Black Mesa and begin [[airstrike]]s. Scaling cliffs and navigating destroyed buildings and underground water channels, Gordon arrives at the Lambda Complex, where scientists developed the teleportation technology that allowed travel to Xen. The remaining staff tell Gordon that the satellite failed to reverse the effects of the resonance cascade as an immensely powerful being on the other side of the rift is keeping it open. The scientists activate the teleporter to send Gordon to Xen and stop the being. 

In Xen, Gordon encounters the remains of researchers before him and defeats [[Gonarch]], the huge egg-laying headcrab. At a factory creating alien soldiers, he defeats levitating creatures and enters a giant portal. In a vast cave, Gordon confronts the [[Nihilanth]], the entity maintaining the rift, and destroys it. Gordon is awoken by the mysterious [[G-Man (Half-Life)|G-Man]], who has been watching his progress and praises his performance. The G-Man explains that his "employers" wish to employ Gordon. If he accepts, the G-Man congratulates him and places him into stasis. If he refuses, he is teleported to an area full of aliens and dies.

| quote = Half-Life in many ways was a reactionary response to the trivialization of the experience of the first-person genre.

[[Valve Corporation|Valve]], based in [[Kirkland, Washington]], was founded in 1996 by former [[Microsoft]] employees [[Mike Harrington]] and [[Gabe Newell]].&lt;ref name="fhhalflife2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uk.gamespot.com/features/halflife_final/part2.html |title=Final Hours of Half-Life: The Microsoft Millionaires |website=GameSpot |accessdate=September 12, 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120520110111/http://uk.gamespot.com/features/halflife_final/part2.html |archivedate=May 20, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; For its first product, Valve settled on a concept for a horror [[first-person shooter]] (FPS) using the [[Quake engine|''Quake'' engine]] licensed from [[id Software]].&lt;ref name="flhalflife22"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uk.gamespot.com/features/halflife_final/part22.html |title=The Final Hours of Half-Life: The id visit |website=GameSpot |accessdate=September 12, 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110223141855/http://uk.gamespot.com/features/halflife_final/part22.html |archivedate=February 23, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Valve eventually modified 70% of the engine's code, adding [[skeletal animation]] and [[Direct3D]] support.&lt;ref name="fhhalflife2" /&gt;

According to designer Harry Teasley, id's 1993 FPS ''[[Doom (1993 video game)|Doom]]'' was a major influence, and the team wanted ''Half-Life'' to "scare you like ''Doom'' did". The project had the working title ''Quiver'', after the ''Arrowhead'' military base from [[Stephen King]]'s 1980 novella ''[[The Mist]]'', an early inspiration for the game.&lt;ref name="fhhalflife3"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uk.gamespot.com/features/halflife_final/part3.html |title=The Final Hours of Half-Life: The Valve Difference |website=GameSpot |accessdate=September 14, 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110224220138/http://uk.gamespot.com/features/halflife_final/part3.html |archivedate=February 24, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The name ''Half-Life'' was chosen because it was evocative of the theme, not clichéd, and had a corresponding visual symbol: the [[Greek alphabet|Greek letter]] λ (lower-case [[lambda]]), which represents the ''decay constant'' in the [[half-life]] equation.&lt;ref name="raisebar" /&gt; According to ''Half-Life''{{'}}s level designer Brett Johnson, the game's level design was inspired by the environments depicted in the [[Japanese cyberpunk]] [[manga]] series ''[[Akira (manga)|Akira]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Half-Life tiene varias referencias a Akira |url=https://as.com/meristation/2018/08/29/noticias/1535543681_545901.html |work=[[:es:MeriStation|MeriStation]] |publisher=''[[Diario AS]]'' |date=August 29, 2018 |language=es}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Valve struggled to find a publisher, as many believed the game was too ambitious for a first-time developer. [[Sierra On-Line]] signed Valve for a one-game deal as it was interested in making a 3D action game, especially one based on the ''Quake'' engine.&lt;ref name="flhalflife24"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uk.gamespot.com/features/halflife_final/part24.html |title=The Final Hours of Half-Life: The Right E-mail, the Right Time |website=GameSpot |accessdate=September 14, 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110224220100/http://uk.gamespot.com/features/halflife_final/part24.html |archivedate=February 24, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Valve first showed ''Half-Life'' in early 1997; it was a success at [[Electronic Entertainment Expo]] that year, where Valve demonstrated the game's animation and [[Artificial intelligence in video games|artificial intelligence]].&lt;ref name="flhalflife34"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uk.gamespot.com/features/halflife_final/part34.html |title=The Final Hours of Half-Life: The Public Debut |website=GameSpot |accessdate=September 14, 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100308234131/http://uk.gamespot.com/features/halflife_final/part34.html |archivedate=March 8, 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Valve aimed for a November 1997 release to compete with ''[[Quake II]]''.&lt;ref name="birdwell gamasutra"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/131815/the_cabal_valves_design_process_.php |title=The Cabal: Valve's Design Process For Creating Half-Life |first=Ken |last=Birdwell |date=December 10, 1999 |accessdate=February 14, 2017 |work=[[Gamasutra]] |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161116140435/http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/131815/the_cabal_valves_design_process_.php |archivedate=November 16, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="fhhalflife4"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uk.gamespot.com/features/halflife_final/part4.html |title=The Final Hours of Half-Life: Reassembling the Pieces |website=GameSpot |accessdate=September 14, 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110928033502/http://uk.gamespot.com/features/halflife_final/part4.html |archivedate=September 28, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; By September 1997, the team found that while they had built a number of innovative aspects in weapons, enemies, and level design, the game was not fun and there was little design cohesion.&lt;ref name="birdwell gamasutra"/&gt; The company postponed the release and reworked every level. They took a novel approach of assigning a small team to build a prototype level containing every element in the game, and then spent a month iterating on the level.&lt;ref name="birdwell gamasutra"/&gt; When the rest of the team played the level, which designer Ken Birdwell described as "''[[Die Hard]]'' meets ''[[Evil Dead]]''", they agreed to use it as a baseline.&lt;ref name="birdwell gamasutra"/&gt; The team developed three theories about what made the level fun. First, the level had a number of interesting things happen in it and all when the player came into near proximity of the event, rather than based on time elements, so that the player would set the pace of the level. Second, the level had means to respond to any player action, even for something as simple as adding graphic decals to wall textures to show a bullet impact. Finally, the level warned the player of imminent danger to allow them to avoid it, rather than killing the player with no warning.&lt;ref name="birdwell gamasutra" /&gt;

To move forward with this unified design, Valve sought a game designer, but found no one suitable for the job. Instead, Valve created the "cabal", initially a group of six individuals from across all departments that worked primarily for six months straight in six-hour meetings four days a week. The cabal was responsible for all elements of design, including level layouts, key events, enemy designs, narrative, and the introduction of gameplay elements relative to the story.&lt;ref name="birdwell gamasutra" /&gt; The collaboration proved successful, and once the cabal had come to decisions on types of gameplay elements that would be needed, mini-cabals formed from other departments most affected by the choice were formed to implement these elements. Membership in the main cabal rotated, since commitment required created [[Occupational burnout|burnout]].&lt;ref name="birdwell gamasutra" /&gt; The cabal produced a 200-page [[Software design description|design document]] detailing nearly every aspect of the game. They also produced a 30-page document for the game's narrative, and hired a writer, novelist [[Marc Laidlaw]], to help manage that script.&lt;ref name="birdwell gamasutra" /&gt;&lt;ref name="fhhalflife3" /&gt; The soundtrack was composed by Kelly Bailey.&lt;ref name="fhhalflife4" /&gt;

Within a month of the cabal's formation, the other team members started detailed game development, and within another month, began [[playtesting]] through Sierra. The cabal were intimately involved with playtesting, monitoring the player but otherwise not interacting. They noted any confusion or inability to solve a game's puzzles and made them into [[action item]]s to be fixed on the next iteration. Later, with most of the main adjustments made, the team included means to benchmark players' actions which they then collected and interpreted statistically to further fine-tune levels.&lt;ref name="birdwell gamasutra" /&gt; Between the cabal and playtesting, Valve identified and removed parts that proved unenjoyable. Birdwell said that while there were struggles at first, the cabal approach was critical for ''Half-Life''{{'}}s success, and was reused for ''[[Team Fortress 2]]'' from the start.&lt;ref name="birdwell gamasutra" /&gt;

A few days prior to the release, the developers discovered an error in the source code. They fixed the error by adding corrections into a single line.{{Citation needed|date=August 2017}} Much of the detail of ''Half-Life''{{'}}s development has been lost; according to employee Erik Johnson, two or three months before release, their [[volume shadow copy|volume shadow service]] "exploded"; they had to compile what they could from was otherwise stored on individual computers at that time, meaning that only the last month of technical changes were preserved. This included saving the source to GoldSrc.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/291408/Valve_explains_why_well_never_see_the_full_history_of_HalfLifes_development.php|title=Valve explains why we'll never see the full history of Half-Life's development|last=Wawro|first=Alex|date=February 13, 2017|work=[[Gamasutra]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170214102632/http://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/291408/Valve_explains_why_well_never_see_the_full_history_of_HalfLifes_development.php|archivedate=February 14, 2017|deadurl=no|accessdate=February 13, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Release ==
''Half-Life'' was released in November 1998.&lt;ref name="fhhalflife5"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uk.gamespot.com/features/halflife_final/part5.html |title=The Final Hours of Half-Life: Reassembling the Pieces |website=GameSpot |accessdate=September 14, 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110225022620/http://uk.gamespot.com/features/halflife_final/part5.html |archivedate=February 25, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The revised version of ''Half-Life'' shown at E3 1998 was given [[Game Critics Awards]] for "Best PC Game" and "Best Action Game".&lt;ref name="fhhalflife4" /&gt; Valve released two [[game demo|demos]] for ''Half-Life.'' The first, ''Half-Life: Day One'', contained the first fifth of the game and was distributed with certain graphic cards. The second demo, ''Half-Life: Uplink'', was released on February 12, 1999, featuring heavily revised variations of levels cut during ''Half-Life''{{'}}s development phase.{{Citation needed|date = February 2016}}

=== Ports ===
''Half-Life'' was [[porting|ported]] to the [[PlayStation 2]] by [[Gearbox Software]] and released in 2001. This version of the game had a significant overhaul in terms of both character models, weapons, and more advanced and extended levels and general map geometry, incorporated from work on a planned [[Dreamcast]] version. Also added in is a head-to-head play and a co-op expansion called ''[[Half-Life: Decay]]'' that allowed players to play as the two female scientists Dr. Cross and Dr. Green at Black Mesa. Another interesting feature allowed players to use a USB mouse and keyboard, a feature previously unused on the platform.{{Citation needed|date=May 2018}}

A version for [[Mac OS]], ported by Logicware, was announced but never released.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.planetfortress.com/syndicate/files/HLmac1.txt | title = SIERRA STUDIOS TO DELIVER BEST-SELLING HALF-LIFE TO THE MAC | last = Ostergrad | first = Genevieve | date = April 23, 1999 | website = PlanetFortress.com | publisher = [[IGN Entertainment]] | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120223180543/http://www.planetfortress.com/syndicate/files/HLmac1.txt | archivedate = February 23, 2012 | accessdate = July 18, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Captivation Digital Laboratories, Inc. was slated to develop a port to the [[Dreamcast]], to be released near the end of 2000. The Dreamcast version revamped the graphics of the game with double the polygon count of the original models. Like ''Opposing Force'' for PC and ''Decay'' for PlayStation 2, the Dreamcast version was set to have its own exclusive expansion, ''Blue Shift''. However, after many delays, the Dreamcast version was canceled in June 2001 due to "changing market conditions".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2001/06/18/not-given-half-a-chance-the-cancellation-of-half-life |title=Not Given Half A Chance: The Cancellation of Half-Life |last=Chau |first=Anthony |date=June 18, 2001 |website=[[IGN]] |publisher=[[IGN Entertainment]] |accessdate=July 18, 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160804093350/http://www.ign.com/articles/2001/06/18/not-given-half-a-chance-the-cancellation-of-half-life |archivedate=August 4, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Blue Shift'' expansion was then preserved and ported over to become ''Half-Life''{{'s}} [[Half-Life: Blue Shift|second expansion]] for PC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2001/03/30/ready-to-jump-back-into-the-black-mesa-research-facility |title=Ready to Jump Back into the Black Mesa Research Facility? |author=IGN Staff |date=March 29, 2001 |website=[[IGN]] |publisher=[[IGN Entertainment]] |accessdate=July 18, 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160820095527/http://www.ign.com/articles/2001/03/30/ready-to-jump-back-into-the-black-mesa-research-facility |archivedate=August 20, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Dreamcast version, in a near finished state, was eventually leaked onto the internet.&lt;ref name="ignnews"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dreamcast.ign.com/articles/095/095905p1.html |title=Not Given Half A Chance: The Cancellation of ''Half-Life'' |website=IGN |accessdate=2006-09-03 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060924201012/http://dreamcast.ign.com/articles/095/095905p1.html |archivedate=September 24, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

That year, Sierra On-Line showed its [[PlayStation 2]] port at [[Electronic Entertainment Expo|E3]] 2001. This version was released in North America in late October of the same year, followed by a European release just a month later. Around the same time, ''Half-Life: Blue Shift'', which was intended to be the Dreamcast-exclusive [[side story]], was eventually released on Windows as the second ''Half-life'' Expansion Pack. It featured the "[[Half-Life High Definition Pack|High Definition Pack]]", upgraded models originally in the Dreamcast version, which overhauled the graphics of the original ''Half-Life'' and ''Opposing Force'' as well.{{Citation needed|date=May 2018}}

On January 29, 2013, Valve released beta versions of ports for [[OS X]] and [[Linux]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://steamcommunity.com/games/70/announcements/detail/1028213578633336572 |title=Half-Life 1 Beta released |author=alfred |date=January 29, 2013 |website=[[Steam (software)|Steam]] |publisher=[[Valve Corporation]] |accessdate=July 18, 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160814194237/http://steamcommunity.com/games/70/announcements/detail/1028213578633336572 |archivedate=August 14, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and finalized them on February 14, 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://steamcommunity.com/games/70/announcements/detail/1027089396435496714 |title=Half-Life 1 update released |author=alfred |date=February 14, 2013 |website=[[Steam (software)|Steam]] |publisher=[[Valve Corporation]] |accessdate=July 18, 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160814160823/http://steamcommunity.com/games/70/announcements/detail/1027089396435496714 |archivedate=August 14, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Expansions and sequels ==

=== Expansions ===
{{Main|Half-Life: Opposing Force|Half-Life: Blue Shift|Half-Life: Decay}}

Two [[expansion pack]]s by outside developer [[Gearbox Software]] have been released for the PC version: ''[[Half-Life: Opposing Force]]'' (1999) and ''[[Half-Life: Blue Shift]]'' (2001). The former returns the player to Black Mesa during the events of ''Half-Life's'' storyline, but this time from the perspective of [[Adrian Shephard]], one of the Marines in the [[Hazardous Environment Combat Unit]] sent to cover up evidence of the incident. It introduced several new weapons, new [[non-player character]]s, both friendly and hostile and new, previously unseen areas of the facility. The expansion is shorter than ''Half-Life'', having 11 chapters to the original's 19.{{Citation needed|date=May 2018}}

''Blue Shift'' returns the player to ''Half-Life'''s Black Mesa timeline once more, this time as [[Barney Calhoun]], one of the facility's security guards. The expansion was originally developed as a bonus mission for the canceled Dreamcast version. ''Blue Shift'' came with the [[Half-Life High Definition Pack|High Definition Pack]], that gave the player the option to update the look of ''Half-Life'', ''Opposing Force'', and the new ''Blue Shift'' content. ''Blue Shift'' had relatively little new content compared to ''Opposing Force'': aside from a few variations on existing models, all content was already present in the original ''Half-Life''.{{Citation needed|date=May 2018}}

''[[Half-Life: Decay]]'' was another expansion by Gearbox, released only as an extra with the [[PlayStation 2]] version of ''Half-Life''. The add-on featured cooperative gameplay in which two players could solve puzzles or fight against the many foes in the ''Half-Life'' universe.{{Citation needed|date=May 2018}}

In 2000, a compilation pack titled the ''Half-Life: Platinum Pack'' was released, including (with their respective manuals) ''Half-Life'', ''[[Counter-Strike (video game)|Counter-Strike]]'', ''[[Team Fortress Classic]]'', ''[[Half-Life: Opposing Force]]''. In 2002, the pack was re-released under the new titles ''Half-Life Platinum Collection'' and ''Half-Life: Generation''. These new iterations also included the ''[[Half-Life: Blue Shift]]'' expansion pack; though if registered on Steam, ''[[Day of Defeat]]'', as well as ''[[Ricochet (2000 video game)|Ricochet]]'' and ''[[Deathmatch Classic]]'' were also included. In 2005, ''Half-Life 1: Anthology'' was released, containing [[Steam (software)|Steam]]-only versions of the following games on a single [[DVD]]: ''Half-Life'', ''[[Half-Life: Opposing Force]]'', ''[[Half-Life: Blue Shift]]'', and ''[[Team Fortress Classic]]''.{{Citation needed|date=May 2018}}

=== Sequels ===
{{Main|Half-Life 2|Half-Life 2: Episode One|Half-Life 2: Episode Two}}

''[[Half-Life 2]]'' was announced at [[Electronic Entertainment Expo|E3]] in May 2003 and released on November 16, 2004. The player controls Gordon Freeman 20 years after the Black Mesa incident in the [[dystopia|dystopic]] [[City 17]], where he must fight as part of a rebellion against an alien regime. It was followed by two [[Episodic video game|episodic]] sequels, ''[[Half-Life 2: Episode One]]'' and ''[[Half-Life 2: Episode Two]]'', released on June 1, 2006, and October 10, 2007, respectively.&lt;ref name="ep2.ep3.confirmation"&gt;{{cite web|last=Thorsen |first=Tor |url=http://www.gamespot.com/articles/half-life-2-episode-one-gold-two-dated-three-announced/1100-6151796/ |title=Half-Life 2: Episode One gold, Two dated, Three announced |website=GameSpot |date=May 24, 2006 |accessdate=April 27, 2007 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131125150657/http://www.gamespot.com/articles/half-life-2-episode-one-gold-two-dated-three-announced/1100-6151796/ |archivedate=November 25, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Remakes ===
{{Main|Black Mesa (video game)}}
To experience firsthand the processes mod-makers would have to go through with the new engine, Valve [[porting|ported]] ''Half-Life'' (dubbed ''Half-Life: Source'') and ''Counter-Strike'' to their new [[Source (game engine)|Source engine]]. ''Half-Life: Source'' is a straight port, lacking any new content or the ''Blue Shift'' High Definition pack. However, it does take advantage of [[shader|vertex and pixel shaders]] for more realistic water effects, as well as ''Half-Life 2's'' realistic physics engine. They also added several other features from ''Half-Life 2'', including improved dynamic lightmaps, vertex maps, ragdolls, and a shadowmap system with cleaner, higher resolution, specular texture and normal maps, as well as utilization of the render-to-texture soft shadows found in ''Half-Life 2'''s Source engine, along with 3D [[skybox (video games)|skybox]] replacements in place of the old 16-bit color prerendered bitmap skies. The ''Half-Life'' port possesses many of the Source engine's graphical strengths as well as control weaknesses that have been noted in the Source engine. Later updates added a [[Field of view in video games|field of view]] option, support for OS X and Linux, an optional high-definition texture pack, among other improvements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://steamcommunity.com/games/280/announcements/detail/2003264815716395225 |title=Half-Life: Source update released |work=Steam |publisher=Valve Corporation |date=September 25, 2013 |accessdate=March 9, 2015 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150320153942/http://steamcommunity.com/games/280/announcements/detail/2003264815716395225 |archivedate=March 20, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Half-Life: Source'' is available with special editions of ''Half-Life 2'', or separately on [[Steam (software)|Steam]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=March 27, 2008|url=http://www.theinquirer.net/en/inquirer/news/2004/09/18/half-life-2-release-candidate-goes-to-vivendi|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080604175605/http://www.theinquirer.net/en/inquirer/news/2004/09/18/half-life-2-release-candidate-goes-to-vivendi |archivedate=June 4, 2008|title=Half Life 2 release candidate goes to Vivendi |publisher=[[The Inquirer]]|date=September 18, 2004|author=Harris, Wil }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Half-Life: Source'' had been criticized for not fully utilizing many of the features of the Source engine found in ''Half-Life 2'', as it still uses textures and models from the original game. In response to this, a third-party mod remake called ''[[Black Mesa (video game)|Black Mesa]]'' was developed with Valve's approval.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.pcgamer.com/the-story-of-half-life-remake-black-mesa/ | title=  The story of Half-Life remake Black Mesa | first = Andy | last =Kelly | date =November 2, 2017 | accessdate = September 16, 2018 | work = [[PC Gamer]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; The first part of the Black Mesa modification, lacking only the final Xen chapter, was released on September 14, 2012.

On June 10, 2005, Valve announced through their Steam update news service an upcoming port of ''Half-Life Deathmatch'', the multiplayer portion of the original game, much in the same fashion as the earlier released ''Half-Life: Source''. No exact release date was given, simply the words "In the coming weeks ..." On July 2, 2005, ''Half-Life Deathmatch: Source'' was released.{{Citation needed|date=May 2018}}

=== Third-party mods ===
{{Main|List of GoldSrc engine mods}}
''Half-Life'' saw fervent support from independent game developers, due in no small part to support and encouragement from Valve. [[Valve Hammer Editor|Worldcraft]], the level-design tool used during the game's development, was included with the game software. Printed materials accompanying the game indicated Worldcraft's eventual release as a retail product, but these plans never materialized. Valve also released a [[software development kit]], enabling developers to modify the game and create [[mod (video gaming)|mods]]. Both tools were significantly updated with the release of the [[Software versioning|version]] 1.1.0.0 [[patch (computing)|patch]]. Many supporting tools (including texture editors, model editors, and rival level editors like the multiple engine editor [[Quake Army Knife|QuArK]]) were either created or updated to work with ''Half-Life''.{{Citation needed|date=May 2018}}

The ''Half-Life'' software development kit served as the development base for many [[multiplayer video game|multiplayer]] mods, including the Valve-developed ''[[Team Fortress Classic]]'' and ''Deathmatch Classic'' (an updated version of ''[[Quake (video game)|Quake]]'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Valve releases Deathmatch Classic mod for Half-Life |first=Trey |last=Walker |date=June 7, 2001 |url=http://www.gamespot.com/articles/valve-releases-deathmatch-classic-mod-for-half-life/1100-2771202/ |website=[[GameSpot]] |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161022201459/http://www.gamespot.com/articles/valve-releases-deathmatch-classic-mod-for-half-life/1100-2771202/ |archivedate=October 22, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other mods such as ''Counter-Strike'' and ''[[Day of Defeat]]'' (''DOD'') began life as the work of independent developers (self-termed "modders") who later received aid from Valve. Other multiplayer mods include ''[[Action Half-Life]]'', ''[[Firearms (video game)|Firearms]]'', ''[[Science and Industry]]'', ''[[The Specialists]]'', ''[[Pirates, Vikings and Knights]]'', ''[[Natural Selection (video game)|Natural Selection]]'' and ''[[Sven Co-op]]''.{{Citation needed|date=July 2016}}

Numerous single player mods have also been created, like ''[[USS Darkstar]]'' (1999, a futuristic action-adventure on board a zoological research spaceship), ''The Xeno Project 1 and 2'' (1999–2005, a two-part mod starting in Xen and again including spaceships), ''Edge of Darkness'' (2000, which features some unused Half-Life models), ''Half-Life: Absolute Redemption'' (2000, which brings back Gordon Freeman for four additional episodes and another encounter with the G-Man), ''[[They Hunger]]'' (2000–2001, a [[survival horror]] [[Total conversion (gaming)|total conversion]] trilogy involving zombies), ''[[Poke646]]'' (2001, a follow-up to the original ''Half-Life'' story with improved graphics), ''[[Someplace Else]]'' (2002, Side story to the original ''Half-Life''), and ''Heart of Evil'' (2003, Vietnam war with zombies).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=March 27, 2008 |url=http://www.gamesover.com/walkthroughs/darkstar_uk.htm |title=Half Life Single Player MOD: USS Darkstar |publisher=Games Over |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080227040228/http://www.gamesover.com/walkthroughs/darkstar_uk.htm |archivedate=February 27, 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some ''Half-Life'' modifications eventually landed on retail shelves. ''Counter-Strike'' was the most successful, having been released in six different editions: as a standalone product (2000), as part of the Platinum Pack (2000), as an [[Xbox (console)|Xbox]] version (2003), as a single player spin-off called ''[[Counter-Strike: Condition Zero]]'' (2004), ''[[Counter-Strike: Source]]'', which runs on ''Half-Life 2'''s Source engine, and the newest addition [[Counter-Strike: Global Offensive]], also running on the Source engine. ''[[Team Fortress Classic]]'', ''[[Day of Defeat]]'', ''[[Gunman Chronicles]]'' (2000, a futuristic [[Western (genre)|Western movie]]-style [[Total conversion (gaming)|total conversion]] with emphasis on its single-player mode) and ''Sven Co-op'' were also released as stand-alone products.{{Citation needed|date=May 2018}}

In 2003, Valve's network was [[Valve Corporation#Network intrusions|infiltrated by hackers]].

''Half-Life'' has a score of 96 out of 100 on aggregate review website [[Metacritic]]. ''[[Computer Gaming World]]''{{'}}s [[Jeff Green (writer)|Jeff Green]] said that the game "is not just one of the best games of the year. It's one of the best games of any year, an instant classic that is miles better than any of its immediate competition, and - in its single-player form - is the best shooter since the original ''[[Doom (1993 video game)|Doom]]''".&lt;ref name=cgw&gt;{{cite web | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20020209221334/http://www.gamespot.com/action/halflif/review_cgw.html | url=http://www.gamespot.com/action/halflif/review_cgw.html | archivedate=February 9, 2002 | date=February 1, 1999 | last=Green | first=Jeff | work=[[Computer Gaming World]] | title=Half-Life | accessdate=April 14, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[IGN]] described it as "a tour de force in game design, the definitive single player game in a first person shooter".&lt;ref name="IGNrev"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uk.pc.ign.com/articles/153/153107p1.html |title=Half-Life Review |website=IGN |accessdate=April 25, 2007 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071126130226/http://uk.pc.ign.com/articles/153/153107p1.html |archivedate=November 26, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; IGN has also described the game as one of the most influential video games,&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2007/12/11/igns-top-10-most-influential-games?page=2 |title=Top 10 Most Influential Games |website=IGN |accessdate=January 6, 2008 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170312131702/http://www.ign.com/articles/2007/12/11/igns-top-10-most-influential-games?page=2 |archivedate=March 12, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; saying that the history of the FPS genre "breaks down pretty cleanly into pre-''Half-Life'' and post-''Half-Life'' eras."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ign.com/top/shooters/1|title=Half-Life - #1 Top Shooters|date=September 13, 2013|website=IGN.com|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140228203738/http://www.ign.com/top/shooters/1|archivedate=February 28, 2014|deadurl=no|accessdate=February 23, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[GameSpot]] claimed that it was the "closest thing to a revolutionary step the genre has ever taken".&lt;ref name="Gamespotrev"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/half-life-review/1900-2537398/ |title=Half-Life Review |website=GameSpot |accessdate=April 25, 2007 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131031232543/http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/half-life-review/1900-2537398/ |archivedate=October 31, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[GameSpot]] inducted ''Half-Life'' into their "Greatest Games of All Time" list in May 2007.&lt;ref name="gamespotfame"&gt;{{cite web|last=Rorie |first=Matthew |url=http://www.gamespot.com/articles/greatest-games-of-all-time-half-life/1100-6171044/ |title=Greatest Games of All Time: Half-Life |website=GameSpot |date=May 18, 2007 |accessdate=March 31, 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150119235122/http://www.gamespot.com/articles/greatest-games-of-all-time-half-life/1100-6171044/ |archivedate=January 19, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004, [[GameSpy]] held a Title Fight, in which readers voted on what they thought was the "greatest game of all time", and Half-Life was the overall winner of the survey.&lt;ref name="Gamespyrev"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.gamespy.com/titlefight/matches/0601.shtml |title=Gamespy Title Fight! - Championship Final |website=[[GameSpy]] |accessdate=February 22, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100523065248/http://archive.gamespy.com/titlefight/matches/0601.shtml |archivedate=May 23, 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the November 1999, October 2001, and April 2005 issues of ''[[PC Gamer]]'', ''Half-Life'' was named "Best Game of All Time"/"Best PC Game Ever".{{Citation needed|date=May 2018}}

The immersive gaming experience and the interactive environment were cited by several reviewers as being revolutionary.&lt;ref name="Allgame" /&gt; [[AllGame]] said, "It isn't everyday that you come across a game that totally revolutionizes an entire genre, but Half-Life has done just that".&lt;ref name="Allgame" /&gt; Hot Games commented on the realism of the game, and how the environment "all adds up to a totally immersive gaming experience that makes everything else look quite shoddy in comparison".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=March 30, 2008|url=http://pc.hotgames.com/games/halfli/review.htm|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030201114816/http://pc.hotgames.com/games/halfli/review.htm |archivedate=February 1, 2003|title=Half-Life review |publisher=Hot Games }}&lt;/ref&gt; Gamers Depot found the game engaging, stating that they have "yet to play a more immersive game period".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=March 30, 2008|url=http://www.gamers-depot.com/games/rev-game-half-life.htm|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050308103126/http://www.gamers-depot.com/games/rev-game-half-life.htm |archivedate=March 8, 2005 |title=Half-Life review |publisher=Gamers Depot }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the praise that the game has received, there have also been some complaints. [[The Electric Playground]] said that ''Half-Life'' was an "immersive and engaging entertainment experience", but said that this only lasted for the first half of the game, explaining that the game "peaked too soon".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=March 30, 2008 |url=http://www.elecplay.com/reviews_article.php?article=204 |title=Half-Life |publisher=[[The Electric Playground]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070910123915/http://www.elecplay.com/reviews_article.php?article=204 |archivedate=September 10, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Guinness World Records]]'' awarded ''Half-Life'' with the world record for Best-Selling First-Person Shooter of All Time (PC) in the ''Guinness World Records: Gamer's Edition 2008''.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}

{{human appearance}}
'''Human physical appearance''' is the outward [[phenotype]] or look of human beings.

There are infinite variations in human phenotypes, though society reduces the variability to distinct categories. Physical appearance of humans, in particular those attributes which are regarded as important for [[physical attractiveness]], are believed by [[anthropologist]]s to significantly affect the development of personality and [[social relations]]. Humans are acutely sensitive to their physical appearance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Anderson-Fye|first=EP|url=https://modificazione.files.wordpress.com/2015/06/anthropological-perspectives-on-physical-appearance-and-body-images.pdf|format=PDF|editor-last=Cash|editor-first=Thomas F.|title=Anthropological Perspectives on Physical Appearance and Body Image|date=2012|department=Body Image and Its Disorder in Anthropology|publisher=Academic Press|volume=1|page=19|doi=10.1016/B978-0-12-384925-0.00003-1|accessdate=August 9, 2018|quote=[Cases] of immigration have repeatedly shown that if a person who is obese believes that his or her body is beyond individual control but is placed into a medical system that assumes individual rational actors in its treatments, adherence is likely to be low and those treatments are ineffective...[Young] ethnic Fijian women associated the thin body ideal with a particular lifestyle that they found desirable}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some differences in human appearance are [[genetics|genetic]], others are the result of [[senescence|age]], [[Lifestyle (sociology)|lifestyle]] or [[disease]], and many are the result of personal [[adornment]].

Some people have linked some differences, with [[Race (classification of human beings)|ethnicity]], such as skeletal shape, [[prognathism]] or elongated stride. Different cultures place different degrees of emphasis on physical appearance and its importance to social status and other phenomena.

== Factors affecting physical appearance ==
Various factors are considered relevant in relation to the physical appearance of humans.

=== Physiological differences ===
Humans are distributed across the globe with the exception of Antarctica, and form a variable species. In adults, average weight varies from around 40 kilos for the smallest and most lightly built tropical people to around 80 kilos for the heavier northern peoples.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Anthropometric Reference Data for Children and Adults: United States, 2003–2006|url=https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhsr/nhsr010.pdf|accessdate=9 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Size also varies between the sexes, the [[sexual dimorphism]] in humans being more pronounced than that of [[chimpanzee]]s, but less than the dimorphism found in gorillas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Shea|first=Brian T.|title=The ontogeny of sexual dimorphism in the African apes|journal=American Journal of Primatology|date=1985|volume=8|issue=2|pages=183–188|doi=10.1002/ajp.1350080208}}&lt;!--|accessdate=9 March 2014--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The colouration of skin, hair and eyes also varies considerably, with darker pigmentation domination in tropical climates and lighter in polar regions.
*Genetic, ethnic affiliation, geographical ancestry.
* [[Human height|Height]], [[body weight]], [[human skin color|skin tone]], [[androgenic hair|body hair]], [[sexual organ]]s, [[mole (skin marking)|moles]], [[birthmark]]s, [[freckle]]s, [[hair color]], [[hair texture]], [[eye color]], [[human eye|eye]] shape (see [[epicanthic fold]]), [[human nose|nose]] shape (see [[nasal bridge]]), [[ear]]s shape (see [[earlobes]]), [[body shape]]
*Body deformations, mutilations and other variations such as [[amputation]]s, [[scar]]s, [[Burn (injury)|burns]] and [[wound]]s.

=== Long-term physiological changes ===
*[[Senescence|Aging]]
*[[Hair loss]]
=== Short-term physiological changes ===
*[[Blushing]], [[crying]], [[fainting]], [[hiccup]], [[yawning]], [[laughing]], [[stuttering]], [[sexual arousal]], [[sweating]], [[shivering]], [[nose bleeding]], [[sun tanning|skin color changes]] due to [[Sunlight|sunshine]] or [[frost]].

=== {{Visible anchor|Clothing, personal effects, and intentional body modifications}} ===&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Clothing]] --&gt;
*[[clothing]], including [[headgear]] and [[footwear]]; some clothes alter or mold the shape of the body (e.g. [[corset]], support pantyhose, [[bra]]). As for [[footwear]], [[High-heeled footwear|high heels]] make a person look taller.
* style and colour of [[haircut]] (see also [[Mohawk hairstyle|mohawk]], [[dreadlocks]], [[braid]]s, [[ponytail]], [[Wig (hair)|wig]], [[hairpin (fashion)|hairpin]], [[facial hair]], [[beard]] and [[moustache]])
*[[cosmetics]], stage makeup, [[body painting]]s, [[permanent makeup]]
*[[body modification]]s, such as [[body piercing]]s, [[tattoo]]s, [[scarification]], [[subdermal implants]]
*[[plastic surgery]]
*decorative objects ([[jewelry]]) such as a [[necklace]]s, [[bracelet]]s, [[finger ring|rings]], [[earring]]s
*medical or body shape altering devices (''e.g.'', [[tooth braces]], [[bandage]]s, [[Cast (orthopedic)|casts]], [[hearing aids]], [[cervical collar]], [[crutches]], [[contact lens]]es of different colours, [[glasses]], [[Grill (jewelry)|gold teeth]]). For example, the same person's appearance can be quite different, depending on whether they use any of the aforementioned modifications.
*exercises, for example, [[bodybuilding]]

==History==
===Founding===
In 1909, [[Eugène Schueller|Eugène Paul Louis Schueller]], a 
young [[French people|French]] [[chemist]] of [[Germany|German]] [[Ancestry|descent]],&lt;ref&gt;.[http://thefashionfoot.com/2013/02/18/eugene-schueller-founder-of-loreal/ The Fashion Foot.]&lt;/ref&gt; developed a hair dye formula called ''Auréale''. Schueller formulated and manufactured his own products, which he then decided to sell to [[Paris]]ian hairdressers.
On 31 July 1919, Schueller registered his company,&lt;ref&gt;[https://prezi.com/a2vt6eplmrmn/corporate-financial-reporting/ Corporate financial reporting by Amberr Aslamm on Prezi]. Prezi.com. Retrieved on 12 April 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; the Société Française de Teintures Inoffensives pour Cheveux (Safe Hair Dye Company of France). The guiding principles of the company, which eventually became L'Oréal, were research and innovation in the field of beauty. In 1920, the company employed three chemists. By 1950, the team was 100 strong; that number reached 1,000 by 1984 and is nearly 82,000 today.

Schueller provided financial support and held meetings for [[La Cagoule]] at L'Oréal headquarters. La Cagoule was a violent French [[fascist]]-leaning and anti-[[communist]] group whose leader formed a political party [[Mouvement Social Révolutionnaire]] (MSR, Social Revolutionary Movement) which in Occupied France supported the Vichy collaboration with the Germans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gladwell.com/2011/2011_03_28_a_color_of_money.html |title=The Color of Money |date=28 March 2011 |work=[[The New Yorker]] |last=Gladwell |first=Malcolm |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120505045702/http://gladwell.com/2011/2011_03_28_a_color_of_money.html |archivedate=5 May 2012  }}&lt;/ref&gt; L'Oréal hired several members of the group as executives after [[World War II]], such as [[Jacques Corrèze]], who served as [[CEO]] of the [[United States]] operation. This involvement was extensively researched by [[Michael Bar-Zohar]] in his book, ''Bitter Scent''.

L'Oréal got its start in the hair-colour business, but the company soon branched out into other cleansing and beauty products. L'Oréal currently markets over 500 brands and thousands of individual products in all sectors of the beauty business: hair colour, permanents, [[Hairstyle|hair styling]], body and skin care, [[Cleanser|cleansers]], makeup and fragrance. The company's products are found in a wide variety of distribution channels, from hair salons and perfumeries to hyper - and supermarkets, health/beauty outlets, pharmacies and direct mail.

===Research and development facilities===
L'Oréal has six worldwide [[research and development]] centres: two in France: [[Aulnay-sous-Bois|Aulnay]] and [[Chevilly-Larue|Chevilly]]; one in the [[United States|U.S.]]: [[Clark, New Jersey|Clark]], [[New Jersey]]; one in [[Japan]]: [[Kawasaki, Kanagawa|Kawasaki]], [[Kanagawa Prefecture]]; in 2005 one was established in [[Shanghai]], [[People's Republic of China|China]], and one in [[India]]. A future facility in the US will be in [[Berkeley Heights, New Jersey]].

===Media===
From 1988 to 1989, L'Oréal controlled the film company [[Paravisión|Paravision]], whose properties included the [[Filmation]] and [[De Laurentiis Entertainment Group|De Laurentiis]] libraries. [[StudioCanal]] acquired the Paravision properties in 1994.

==Acquisitions==
L'Oréal purchased Synthélabo in 1973 to pursue its ambitions in the pharmaceutical field. Synthélabo merged with [[Sanofi]] in 1999 to become [[Sanofi-Synthélabo]].  Sanofi-Synthélabo merged with [[Aventis]] in 2004 to become [[Sanofi-Aventis]].

On 17 March 2006, L'Oréal purchased cosmetics company [[The Body Shop]] for [[Pound sterling|£]]562 million.

L'Oréal's [[advertising slogan]] is "Because I'm worth it". In the mid 2000s, this was replaced by "Because you're worth it". In late 2009, the slogan was changed again to "Because we're worth it" following motivation analysis and work into consumer psychology of Dr. Maxim Titorenko. The shift to "we" was made to create stronger consumer involvement in L'Oréal philosophy and lifestyle and provide more consumer satisfaction with L'Oréal products. L'Oréal also owns a Hair and Body products line for kids called [[L'Oréal Kids]], the slogan for which is "Because we're worth it too".

==Marketing==
In 1987, during the growth years of the mail order business, L'Oréal and [[3 Suisses]]  founded Le Club des Créateurs de Beauté for mail-order sales of cosmetic products, with brands including Agnès b., Cosmence and Professeur Christine Poelman among others.  In March 2008, L'Oréal acquired 3 Suisse's stake, taking sole control of the company.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cosmeticsdesign-asia.com/Business-Financial/L-Oreal-buys-stake-in-beauty-brand "L'Oreal buys stake in beauty brand"], ''Cosmetics Design Asia''. Retrieved on 13 June 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2013, L'Oréal announced that Le Club des Créateurs de Beauté would cease activity in the first half of 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.premiumbeautynews.com/en/l-oreal-to-end-the-activity-of,6187|title=L'Oréal to end the activity of Beauté Créateurs its mail-order subsidiary|accessdate=12 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2012, L'Oréal inaugurated the largest factory in the [[Cikarang|Jababeka Industrial Park, Cikarang]], Indonesia, with a total investment of US$100 million.&lt;ref&gt;[http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/slideshows/day-in-pics/november-08-2012/loreal-opens-largest-factory-in-cikarang/slideshow/17140910.cms "L'Oreal opens largest factory in Cikarang"], ''The Economic Times'', India, 8 November 2012. Retrieved on 13 June 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; The production will be absorbed 25 percent by domestic market and the rest will be exported. In 2010, significant growth occurred at Indonesia with 61 percent increase of unit sales or 28 percent of net sales.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.asianewsnet.net/home/news.php?id=17498&amp;sec=2 L'Oreal to build its largest factory worth $50m in Indonesia]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other acquisitions===
In January 2014, L'Oréal finalised the acquisition of major [[China|Chinese]] beauty brand Magic Holdings for $840 million.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2014-01-16/loreal-acquires-chinese-beauty-brand-magic-holdings-for-840m L'Oréal Acquires Major Chinese Beauty Brand]&lt;/ref&gt;

On 11 February 2014 it was announced that L'Oreal had sealed a deal worth €3.4bn to buy back 8% of its shares from Swiss consumer goods giant Nestle. As a result of the deal, Nestle's stake in L'Oreal will be reduced from 29.4pc to 23.29pc while the Bettencourt Meyers family's stake will increase from 30.6pc to 33.2pc. Nestle has owned a stake in L'Oreal since 1974 when it bought into the company at the request of [[Liliane Bettencourt]], the daughter of the founder of L'Oreal and world's richest woman, who was trying to prevent the French state's intervention in the company.

On 20 February 2014, Shiseido agreed to sell its Carita and Decléor brands to L'Oréal for €227.5 million (US$312.93 million (2014)).&lt;ref name="Shiseido Sells Carita, Decléor to L'Oréal"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.wwd.com/beauty-industry-news/financial/shiseido-sells-carita-declor-to-loral-7487620?src=n/newsAlert/20140219-7 | title=Shiseido Sells Carita, Decléor to L'Oréal | publisher=WWD | date=19 February 2014 | accessdate=20 February 2014 | author=Kaiser, Amanda}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 18 June 2014, L'Oréal agreed to acquire [[NYX Cosmetics]] for an undisclosed price, bolstering its makeup offer in [[North America]] where its consumer-products unit has faltered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businessweek.com/news/2014-06-18/l-oreal-agrees-to-acquire-u-dot-s-dot-makeup-artist-brand-nyx-cosmetics|title=L'Oreal Agrees to Buy U.S. Makeup-Artist Brand NYX Cosmetics|accessdate=18 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2014, L'Oréal announced it had agreed to purchase [[Brazil]]ian hair care company Niely Cosmeticos Group for an undisclosed amount.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release | publisher=Reuters| date=8 September 2014| title=L'Oreal to buy Brazilian hair care group Niely Cosmeticos | url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2014/09/08/us-l-oreal-m-a-brazil-idUSKBN0H30EN20140908}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The world's largest hair salon is located inside the head office building. As of 2005, 90 hairdressers served 300 women, including retirees, students, and unemployed people, per day; the customers are used as test subjects for new hair colours.&lt;ref&gt;Klawitter, Nils.

===Joint ventures and minority interests===
L'Oréal holds 10.41% of the shares of [[Sanofi-Aventis]], the world's number three and Europe's number one pharmaceutical company.  The '''Laboratoires Innéov''' is a [[joint venture]] in nutritional cosmetics between L'Oréal and [[Nestlé]]; they draw on L'Oréal's knowledge in the fields of [[nutrition]] and [[food safety]].

===Corporate social responsibility===

====Group-wide sustainability plan====
L'Oreal announced a new sustainability plan in 2013, which they hope will help reach the goal of 1 billion new consumers by 2020 by producing more products with less environmental impact and helping customers make sustainable lifestyle choices. The main commitments to achieve by 2020 include: aiming for 100 percent of its products to have an environmental or social benefit; reducing the company's environmental footprint by 60 percent; and empowering consumers to make sustainable consumption choices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marketingweek.co.uk/news/loral-outlines-2020-sustainability-goals/4008356.article|title=L'Oréal Outlines 2020 Sustainability Goals|accessdate=14 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Sustainable development====
In 2009, L'Oréal declared their intention to cut greenhouse gas emissions, water consumption and waste by 50% over the period 2005-2015 &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.environmentalleader.com/2009/04/23/loreal-to-reduce-ghg-emissions-water-consumption-and-waste-by-50/|title= L'Oreal to Reduce GHG Emissions, Water Consumption and Waste by 50%|publisher= Environmental Leader|date= 23 April 2009|accessdate=11 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; – a deduction in carbon dioxide emissions that is to be in part achieved by the use of solar panels, biogas and electricity and hot water produced from the combustion of methane gas recovered from agricultural waste.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uk.fashionmag.com/news/L-Oreal-wants-to-cut-its-CO2-emissions-in-half-by-2015,60830.html#.UimqX9K8Bag|title= L'Oréal wants to cut its CO2 emissions in half by 2015|publisher= Fashionmag.com|date=21 April 2009|accessdate=11 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, the company declared a 37.1% deduction in C02 Emissions, a 24% deduction in water consumption and a 22% deduction in transportable waste, and was named a sector leader by [[Climate Counts]] for its practices and achievements in the management of carbon emissions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.csrwire.com/press_releases/34964-L-Or-al-Recognized-by-Climate-Counts-as-Sector-Leader-for-Managing-Reporting-and-Reducing-its-Carbon-Emissions| title= L'Oréal Recognized by Climate Counts as Sector Leader for Managing, Reporting and Reducing its Carbon Emissions |publisher= CSR Wire|date= 5 December 2012|accessdate=11 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 2014, L'Oréal made the commitment to ensure that none of its products were linked to deforestation, and to source 100% renewable raw materials by 2020.&lt;ref name=cosmeticsdesigneurope&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cosmeticsdesign-europe.com/Business-Financial/L-Oreal-reiterates-sustainability-importance-with-zero-deforestation-commitment| title= L'Oréal reiterates sustainability importance with ‘zero deforestation' commitment |publisher= Cosmetics design-europe.com|date= 15 January 2014|accessdate=6 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The group was included in the Corporate Knights "Global 100" list of the 100 most sustainable companies.&lt;ref name=cosmeticsdesigneurope/&gt;

====Position on animal testing====
Since the 80s, L'Oréal has invested €900 million in researching [[alternatives to animal testing]] for product safety, using methods such as reconstructed skin models, like the Episkin model&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cosmeticsdesign-europe.com/Formulation-Science/L-Oreal-builds-on-skin-testing-capabilities |title=L'Oreal builds on skin testing capabilities|accessdate=12 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; at their research centers in Gerland, France, and [[Pudong]], China.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://answers.loreal.com/animaltesting/en/our-position/|title=Our Position|publisher=L'Oréal Answers|accessdate=12 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nevertheless, this is complicated by markets such as China,&lt;ref name=bweekchina&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businessweek.com/news/2013-08-21/china-animal-testing-complicates-l-oreal-s-expansion-retail|title=China Animal Testing Complicates L'Oreal's Expansion|date=21 August 2013|accessdate=12 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; where animal testing of all cosmetics for human use is mandatory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2181468/Big-beauty-brands-dropping-cruelty-free-animal-testing-policies-sell-products-China.html | location=London | work=Daily Mail | title=L'Occitane and Yves Rocher: The big-name beauty brands among those ditching cruelty-free animal testing policies to sell their products to China}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cosmetics by brands such as [[The Body Shop]], which refuses to do [[animal testing]], are thus not available for sale in the Chinese market.

In 2013, L'Oréal was part of a consortium calling on the EU to invest more in research on alternatives to animal testing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/jul/18/animal-testing-talk-about-medical-research|title=Animal testing – it's time to talk about it again|author=Bibi van der Zee|publisher=The Guardian|date=18 July 2013|accessdate=12 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Community involvement and awards===
In 2014, L'Oreal was listed 61st among 1200 of India's most trusted brands according to the [[The Brand Trust Report|Brand Trust Report]] 2014, a study conducted by Trust Research Advisory, a brand analytics company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.trustadvisory.info/allindia_2014.html |title=India's Most Trusted Brands 2014 |date= |accessdate= |website= |publisher= |last= |first= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150502221904/http://www.trustadvisory.info/allindia_2014.html |archivedate= 2 May 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, L'Oréal was named Europe's top business employer by the European Student Barometer,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.trendence.de/fileadmin/pdf/ESB_2008.pdf|title=The European Student Barometer 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;  a survey conducted by Trendence that covers 20 European countries and incorporates the responses of over 91,000 students.

The [[L'Oréal-UNESCO Awards for Women in Science]] was established to improve the position of women in science by recognizing outstanding women researchers who have contributed to scientific progress.

The awards are a result of a partnership between the French cosmetics company L'Oréal and the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization ([[UNESCO]]) and carry a grant of $100,000 USD for each laureate.

The same partnership awards the UNESCO-L'Oréal International Fellowships, providing up to $40,000 USD in funding over two years to fifteen young women scientists engaged in exemplary and promising research projects.&lt;ref&gt;[http://portal.unesco.org/en/ev.php-URL_ID=14633&amp;URL_DO=DO_TOPIC&amp;URL_SECTION=201.html/ UNESCO/L'ORÉAL Co-Sponsored Fellowships for Young Women in Life Sciences] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141010122943/http://portal.unesco.org/en/ev.php-URL_ID%3D14633%26URL_DO%3DDO_TOPIC%26URL_SECTION%3D201.html |date=10 October 2014 }}. Portal.unesco.org.&lt;/ref&gt;

L'Oréal organises the yearly L'Oréal Brandstorm, a business game for students in 43 countries. The game is related to marketing and has a first prize of $10,000, a second prize of $5,000 and a third prize of $2500.

L'Oréal is also a founding member of the "Look Good...Feel Better" project, a charity which was formed over 16 years ago to help women combat the visible side effects of cancer treatment.

In 2015, [[Standard Ethics Aei]] gave a rating to L'Oreal in order to include it in its Standard Ethics French Index.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.standardethicsindices.eu/standard-ethics-french-index.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=11 April 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160403113833/http://standardethicsindices.eu/standard-ethics-french-index.html |archivedate=3 April 2016  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research and innovation==

===Episkin===
Episkin is a reconstructed skin model developed by engineers at L'Oréal France to provide an alternatives to animal testing.&lt;ref name="Skin Replaces Animal Tests"&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.animalliberationfront.com/Philosophy/Animal%20Testing/SkinReplacesAnimTests.htm | work= Animal Liberation Front|title= Human Skin to Replace Animal Tests|date=12 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Human [[skin cells]] left over from breast surgery &lt;ref name="Skin Replaces Animal Tests" /&gt; are developed under [[in vitro]] laboratory conditions to form sheets of reconstructed skin.&lt;ref name="Build on Animal Testing"&gt;{{cite news| url= http://www.cosmeticsdesign-europe.com/Formulation-Science/L-Oreal-builds-on-skin-testing-capabilities | work=Cosmetic Design Europe| title=L'Oréal Builds on Skin Testing Capabilities| date=12 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; This has advantages over animal testing other than the sparing of animals: it can be adapted to create reconstructions of a range of skin colours, as well as younger and older skin, meaning that safety tests give more relevant results for humans.&lt;ref name="Build on Animal Testing" /&gt;
In 2006, the Episkin division acquired SkinEthic, a leading [[tissue engineering]] company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url= http://www.euroinvestor.fr/actualites/2006/02/28/loreal-episkin-subsidiary-of-loreal-acquires-skinethic-leader-in-tissue-engineering/9331794 | work=Euro Investor| title=L´OREAL : EPISKIN, SUBSIDIARY OF L´OREAL, ACQUIRES SKINETHIC, LEADER IN TISSUE ENGINEERING| date=12 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The aim for L'Oréal is to produce products that cater to their diverse customers specifically, in the emerging markets that currently account for 53% of the entire global beauty market.&lt;ref name="GCI"&gt;{{cite news| url= http://www.gcimagazine.com/business/management/innovation/111854374.html?page=1| work=GCI| title=L'Oréal Unveils New Research and Innovation Strategy| date=10 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through these research methods L'Oréal aims to tap into one billion new consumers &lt;ref name="GCI" /&gt; in these markets for the upcoming years.

In 2003, the L'Oréal Institute for Ethnic Hair &amp; Skin Research was inaugurated in Chicago to continue their research on African American hair and skin among other ethnicities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url= http://www.capitalfm.co.ke/lifestyle/2012/11/09/4th-loreal-workshop-on-african-hair-and-skin-currently-underway/| work=LIFESTYLE Mahazine| title=4th L'Oreal workshop on African hair and skin currently underway | date=9 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The L'Oréal Group opened ''the Predictive Evaluation Center'' in Lyon, France in 2011. This centre is devoted to evaluating the quality of the products without testing on animals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url= https://www.wizness.com/wizness/go.asp?u=/pub/NP&amp;nid=494&amp;lngWiz=EN| work=Wizness| title= L'Oreal 2011 Sustainability Report &gt; Towards Responsible Beauty? | date=3 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, L'Oréal built an international "Consumer Insights" division as well as, regional Research and Innovation centres in six countries: [[Japan]], [[China]], [[India]], the United States, [[Brazil]], and [[France]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url= http://lecercle.lesechos.fr/entrepreneur/marketing-communication/221147734/how-oreal-fights-commoditization-with-reverse-innovat| work=Les Echos| title=How L'Oréal fights commoditization with reverse innovation| date=8 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The aim of these centres is to collect information on their diverse consumers in order to develop products according to their various needs.  In 2011, L'Oréal announced its intention to build a ''Research and Innovation Center'' in Bom Jesus Island Rio de Janeiro, [[Brazil]]. Estimated at 30 million euros (70,000,000 reals), this project is expected to create about 150 jobs by 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url= http://www.premiumbeautynews.com/en/l-oreal-a-new-research-and,3682| work=Premium Beauty News| title=L'Oréal: a new research and innovation centre in Rio| date=20 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The L'Oreal Global Hair Research Centre, a facility in Paris Saint-Ouen opened in March 2012. It serves as the headquarters for the international departments of hair color, hair care and hair styling. One of the largest investments in company R&amp;I history, the 25,000m² Centre hosts 500 employees. These include chemists, physico-chemists, opticians, materials scientists, metrologists, rheologists, computer scientists and statisticians. The facility offers automation, modelling and sensory evaluation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.cosmeticsandtoiletries.com/networking/news/company/144637335.html?page=1

===Human skin 3D printing===
L'Oreal announced in May 2015 that it was partnering with bioprinting startup [[Organovo]] to figure out how to 3D print living, breathing derma that can be used to test products for toxicity and efficacy. "We're the first beauty company that Organovo has worked with," said Guive Balooch, global vice president of L'Oreal's tech incubator.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-05-18/l-oreal-s-plan-to-start-3d-printing-human-skin| work=Bloomberg| title=L'Oreal's Plan to Start 3D Printing Human Skin| date=18 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modiface===
On 16 March 2018, L'Oréal announced that it had acquired Modiface, a beauty tech company that uses [[augmented reality]] to allow users to digitally try on different makeup products and hairstyles.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theverge.com/2018/3/16/17131260/loreal-modiface-acquire-makeup-ar-try-on|title=L’Oreal acquires Modiface, a major AR beauty company|work=The Verge|access-date=19 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Litigation==

===Advertising===
In May 2007, L'Oréal was one of several cosmetic manufacturers (along with Clinique, Estee Lauder, Payot, Lancôme)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = Beauty and the publicity beast|date = 9 May 2007|last = Costello|first = John|work = The Evening Herald|url = http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-163157135.html|accessdate = 14 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; ordered by the [[Therapeutic Goods Administration]] in Australia to withdraw advertising regarding the [[wrinkle (skin)|wrinkle]] removal capabilities of their products.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Wrinkle creams are a rip-off|url=http://www.news.com.au/entertainment/story/0,23663,21682971-36557,00.html|publisher=[[The Daily Telegraph (Sydney)]]|date=7 May 2007|accessdate=20 July 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the UK, L'Oréal has faced criticism from [[OFCOM]] regarding the truth of their advertising and marketing campaigns concerning the product performance of one of their mascara brands. In July 2007, the British [[Advertising Standards Authority (United Kingdom)|Advertising Standards Authority]] attacked L'Oréal for a television advert on its "Telescopic" [[mascara]], featuring [[Penélope Cruz]], stating, "it will make your [[eyelash]]es 60% longer." In fact, it only made the lashes look 60% bigger, by separating and thickening at the roots and by thickening the tips of the lashes. They also failed to state that the model was wearing [[Eyelash extensions|false eyelash]]es.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asa.org.uk/asa/adjudications/Public/TF_ADJ_42910.htm |title=L'Oréal (UK) Ltd |publisher=Asa.org.uk |date=25 July 2007 |accessdate=31 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2011, the British Advertising Standards Authority took action against L'Oréal, banning two airbrushed [[Lancôme]] advertisements in the UK featuring actress [[Julia Roberts]] and supermodel [[Christy Turlington]]. The agency issued the ban after British politician [[Jo Swinson]] argued that the two ads misrepresented reality and added to the self-image problem amongst females in the UK. L'Oréal acknowledged that the photos had been airbrushed but argued that the two cosmetic products could actually produce the results depicted in the ads and that the results of the products had been scientifically proven.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2011/WORLD/europe/07/28/airbrushed.advertisements.ban/index.html?&amp;hpt=hp_c2 |title=Britain bans airbrushed Julia Roberts make-up ad |publisher=CNN |date=29 July 2011 |accessdate=29 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2014 the company reached agreement with the U.S. [[Federal Trade Commission]] not to make claims about its anti-aging products unless it had credible scientific evidence supporting the claims. The settlement followed an investigation by the commission into claims being made in relation to two products, which the commission described as "false and unsubstantiated."

L'Oréal has a team of 400 members of staff who post content to [[Facebook]] every day, according to Marc Menesguen, the company's chief marketing officer.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vanityfair.com/business/2013/05/facebook-future-mark-zuckerberg-sheryl-sandberg A Facebook of the Future: Mark Zuckerberg and Sheryl Sandberg Show Us Their New Content, New Algorithms, and New Alliances | Vanity Fair&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Human resources===
On 11 August 2005, the [[Supreme Court of California]] ruled that former L'Oréal sales manager Elyse Yanowitz had adequately pleaded a cause of action for retaliatory termination under the [[California Fair Employment and Housing Act]], and remanded the case for trial.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;''Yanowitz v. L'Oréal USA, Inc.'', [http://online.ceb.com/CalCases/C4/36C4t1028.htm 36 Cal. 4th 1028] (2005).&lt;/ref&gt; The case arose out of a 1997 incident in which Jack Wiswall, then the general manager for designer fragrances, allegedly told Yanowitz to fire a [[Person of color|dark-skinned]] sales associate despite the associate's good performance. When Yanowitz refused, Wiswall pointed to a "sexy" blonde-haired woman and said "God damn it, get me one that looks like that."  Wiswall retired as president of the luxury products division of L'Oréal USA at the end of 2006.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1" /&gt;

The company has recently faced discrimination lawsuits in France related to the hiring of spokesmodels and [[institutional racism]]. In July 2007, the [[Garnier]] division and an external employment agency were fined €30,000 for recruitment practices that intentionally excluded non-white women from promoting its hair wash, "Fructis Style".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.soxfirst.com/50226711/loreal_found_guilty_of_racism.php |title=L'Oreal found guilty of racism |publisher=Sox First |accessdate=31 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; L'Oréal is reported as saying the decision was "incomprehensible",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.africaresource.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=425:loreal-tells-women-of-color-to-take-a-hike&amp;catid=136:race&amp;Itemid=351 |title=L'Oreal Tells Women of Color to Take a Hike - AfricaResource: The Place for Africa on the Net |publisher=AfricaResource |date=30 August 2007 |accessdate=31 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and would challenge the measure in court.

In August 2017, L'Oréal dismissed Munroe Bergdorf, a [[mixed-race]] [[transgender]] model, after she responded to the [[Unite the Right rally]] in [[Charlottesville, Virginia]] by stating in a [[Facebook]] post that racism is institutionalized in society by white people. Shortly after terminating Bergdorf, L'Oréal released a statement reaffirming their commitment to "[support] diversity and tolerance towards all people irrespective of their race, background, gender and religion" and had terminated their partnership with Bergdorf because her comments were "at odds with those values."&lt;ref name="theguardianonthelorealcismrow"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Iqbal|first1=Nosheen|title=Munroe Bergdorf on the L’Oréal racism row: ‘It puzzles me that my views are considered extreme’|url=https://www.theguardian.com/global/2017/sep/04/munroe-bergdorf-on-the-loreal-racism-row-it-puzzles-me-that-my-views-are-considered-extreme|accessdate=5 September 2017|work=The Guardian|date=4 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nytimeslorealdropstransgendermodel"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Fortin|first1=Jacey|title=L’Oréal Drops Transgender Model Over Comments on Race|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/02/business/munroe-bergdorf-loreal-transgender.html?mcubz=1&amp;_r=0|accessdate=5 September 2017|work=The New York Times|date=2 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Animal testing==
L'Oréal pays companies to test on animals for the China market &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.peta.org/living/beauty/beauty-brands-that-you-thought-were-cruelty-free-but-arent/ | title = These Beauty Brands Are Still Tested on Animals | publisher = [[PETA]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; as China requires cosmetics companies perform animal testing in government labs before regulators approve products for sale. 
All brands that import products to sell in China must animal test. In CNBC's 2017 article, "In China, Big Cosmetic Firms are Selling Products Tested on Animals," the author reached out to L'Oréal for a comment but they didn't respond.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.cnbc.com/2017/04/19/in-china-big-cosmetics-firms-are-selling-products-tested-on-animals.html | title = In China, big cosmetics firms are selling products tested on animals | publisher = [[CNBC]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy==
[[Eugène Schueller]], the company's founder, was an alleged [[Nazi]] sympathizer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.forbes.com/2005/03/18/cz_sh_0318oreal_bill05.html | work=Forbes | title=Father's Past Haunts French Billionaire | date=18 March 2005 | first=Suzanne | last=Hoppough}}&lt;/ref&gt; L'Oréal concedes that Schueller was an [[anti-Semitic]] [[fascist]].&lt;ref name="Business Notes Scandal L'Oreal's"&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,157348,00.html | work=Time | title=Business Notes Scandal L'Oreal's | date=24 June 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He was also a member of [[La Cagoule]], which supported the [[Vichy regime]], and was a violent, pro-fascist and anti-communist organization.  Eugène bankrolled La Cagoule and some meetings of [[La Cagoule]] were held at L'Oréal headquarters. Some of the criminal activities perpetrated by La Cagoule include firearms transportation, assassinating a former minister, and firebombing six synagogues.&lt;ref name="André Bettencourt"&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/1570119/Andre-Bettencourt.html | location=London | work=The Daily Telegraph | title=André Bettencourt | date=22 November 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Pascal"&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/books/reviews/loreal-took-my-home-by-monica-waitzfelder-translated-by-peter-bush-432358.html |title= L'Oreal Took My Home, by Monica Waitzfelder, translated by Peter Bush| location=London | work=The Independent | first=Julia | last=Pascal | date=16 January 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other controversy arose when [[Jean Frydman]], a shareholder and board member of Paravision, a film subsidiary of L'Oréal, was fired. He claims that he was let go because L'Oréal wanted to avoid an Arab boycott of businesses associated with Jews. In turn, Frydman decided to expose the past of L'Oréal executives. [[André Bettencourt]] who married Schueller's daughter, [[Liliane Bettencourt]], and became deputy chairman for L'Oréal, wrote 60 articles for La Terre Française. La Terre Française was an anti-Semitic Nazi propaganda sheet. André has admitted ownership of the [[propaganda]] but claimed he was poisoned by the [[Vichy France|Vichy]] regime and said, "I have repeatedly expressed my regrets concerning them in public and will always beg the Jewish community to forgive me for them."&lt;ref name="André Bettencourt"/&gt; André Bettencourt also sheltered Schueller and several collaborators from the [[French Resistance]] after Liberation.&lt;ref name="Pascal"/&gt; It was also revealed that Eugène Schueller hired [[Jacques Correze]], who was the honorary head of L'Oréal's U.S. affiliate, Cosmair, and was involved with [[La Cagoule]].&lt;ref name="Business Notes Scandal L'Oreal's"/&gt;

Further controversy arose when it was revealed that L'Oréal had its German headquarters for over 30 years, before being sold in 1991, on land confiscated from a Jewish family during [[World War II]]. The Jewish family has been battling for restitution from the company for three generations, the latest of which is Edith Rosenfelder, a [[The Holocaust|Holocaust]] survivor. Fritz Rosenfelder, was forced to sell the house to a Nazi official, of which the family never received the proceeds of the sale. Instead, the family was deported. The Allies passed Jewish restitution legislation which states that transactions with Nazis, even if appearing to be with the owner's consent, can be considered invalid. As the land was sold to an offshoot of L'Oréal, which was later bought out in 1961 by L'Oréal, the company claims that it is not responsible for anything that happened before then. The basis for Rosenfelder's argument is that since the original sale was illegal, all subsequent sales are equally unlawful. There was restitution paid in 1951 to the [[Jewish Restitution Successor Organization]], though this was done without the family's consent and none of the money ever reached the family. A book by Monica Waitzfelder, daughter of Edith Rosenfelder, published in French as ''L'Oréal a pris ma maison'' and in English as ''L'Oréal stole my house!'', details how L'Oréal, took over the Waitzfelder home in the [[Germany|German]] city of [[Karlsruhe]] (after the Nazis had engineered the removal of the family) to make it its German headquarters.&lt;ref name="Gentleman"&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2004/oct/13/secondworldwar.germany | location=London | work=The Guardian | first=Amelia | last=Gentleman | title=L'Oréal profited from victims of Nazis, court told | date=13 October 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Monica Waitzfelder is quoted as saying, "All the other businesses which took Jewish property have since returned it, without any great debate. I don't understand why L'Oréal should be any different from the others." A case was brought before the Supreme Court in France, but the public prosecutor ruled that there could be no trial.  As of 2007, she is bringing the case to the [[European Court of Human Rights]].&lt;ref name="Pascal"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Gentleman"/&gt;

Following L'Oréal's 2006 purchase of [[The Body Shop]], which does not support [[animal testing]], The Body Shop's founder [[Anita Roddick]] was forced to defend herself against allegations of abandoning her principles over L'Oréal's track record on animal testing. Calls were made for shoppers to boycott The Body Shop.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20100424192639/http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/this-britain/anitas-163652m-sellout-470379.html "Anita's £652m sell-out"], ''The Independent'' (London). 18 March 2006.

Published on p. 3 of the ''Freeman's Journal'' of 28 January 1863]]

A '''letter to the editor'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uwp.duke.edu/wstudio/resources/documents/letter_to_editor.pdf |title=Definition from Duke University's University Writing Program |publisher=Uwp.duke.edu |date= |accessdate=2011-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; (sometimes [[Abbreviation|abbreviated]] '''LTTE''' or '''LTE''') is a [[Letter (message)|letter]] sent to a [[publication]] about issues of concern from its readers. Usually, letters are intended for publication. In many publications, letters to the editor may be sent either through [[Mail|conventional mail]] or [[electronic mail]].

Letters to the editor are most frequently associated with [[newspapers]] and [[newsmagazines]]. However, they are sometimes published in other [[periodical]]s (such as entertainment and technical magazines), and [[radio station|radio]] and [[television station|television]] stations. In the latter instance, letters are sometimes read on the air (usually, on a news broadcast or on [[talk radio]]). In that presentation form, it can also be described as '''viewer mail''' or '''listener mail''', depending on the medium.

In [[academic publishing]], letters to the editor of an [[academic journal]] are usually open [[postpublication review]]s of a paper, often critical of some aspect of the original paper. The authors of the original paper sometimes respond to these with a letter of their own. Controversial papers in mainstream journals often attract numerous letters to the editor. Good [[citation index]]ing services list the original papers together with all replies. Depending on the length of the letter and the journal's style, other types of headings may be used, such as '''peer commentary'''. There are some variations on this practice. Some journals request open commentaries as a matter of course, which are published together with the original paper, and any authors' reply, in a process called [[open peer commentary]]. The introduction of the "[[Electronic article|epub]] ahead of print" practice in many journals now allows unsolicited letters to the editor (and authors' reply) to appear in the same print issue of the journal, as long as they are sent in the interval between the electronic publication of the original paper and its appearance in print.

==Subject matter==
The subject matter of letters to the editor vary widely. However, the most common topics include:

* Supporting or opposing a stance taken by the publication in its [[editorial]], or responding to another writer's letter to the editor.
* Commenting on a current issue being debated by a governing body – local, regional or national depending on the publication's circulation. Often, the writer will urge elected officials to make their decision based on his/her viewpoint.
* Remarking on materials (such as a news story) that have appeared in a previous edition. Such letters may either be critical or praising.
* Correcting a perceived error or misrepresentation.

==History==
{{globalize|section|date=December 2010}}

LTEs always have been a feature of American newspapers.  Much of the earliest news reports and commentaries published by early-American newspapers were delivered in the form of letters, and by the mid-18th century, LTEs were a dominant carrier of political and social discourse.  Many influential essays about the role of government in matters such as personal freedoms and economic development took the form of letters — consider [[Cato's Letters]] or [[Letters from a Farmer in Pennsylvania]], which were widely reprinted in early American newspapers. Through the 19th century, LTEs were increasingly centralized near the editorials of newspapers, so that by the turn of the 20th century LTEs had become permanent fixtures of the opinion pages.

Modern LTE forums differ little from those earlier counterparts.  A typical forum will include a half-dozen to a dozen letters (or excerpts from letters). The letters chosen for publication usually are only a sample of the total letters submitted, with larger-circulation publications running a much smaller percentage of submissions and small-circulation publications running nearly all of the relatively few letters they receive.  Editors generally read all submissions, but in general most will automatically reject letters that include profanity, libelous statements, personal attacks against individuals or specific organizations, that are unreasonably long (most publications suggest length limits ranging from 200 to 500 words) or that are submitted anonymously.

The latter criterion is a fairly recent development in LTE management. Prior to the Cold War paranoia of the mid-20th century, anonymous LTEs were common; in fact, the right to write anonymously was central to the free-press/free-speech movement (as in the 1735 trial against [[John Peter Zenger]], which started with an anonymous essay).  By the 1970s, editors had developed strong negative attitudes toward anonymous letters, and by the end of the 20th century, about 94 percent of newspapers automatically rejected anonymous LTEs. Some newspapers in the 1980s and '90s created special anonymous opinion forums that allowed people to either record short verbal opinions via telephone (which were then transcribed and published) or send letters that were either unsigned or where the author used a pseudonym. Although many journalists derided the anonymous call-in forums as unethical (for instance, someone could make an unfounded opinion without worry of the consequences or having to back the comment up with hard facts), defenders argued that such forums upheld the free-press tradition of vigorous, uninhibited debate similar to that found in earlier newspapers.

Although primarily considered a function of print publications, LTEs also are present in electronic media.  In broadcast journalism, LTEs have always been a semi-regular feature of 60 Minutes and the news programs of National Public Radio.  LTE's also are widespread on the Internet in various forms.

By the early 21st century, the Internet had become a delivery system for many LTEs via e-mail and news Web sites (in fact, after several envelopes containing a powder suspected to be anthrax were mailed to lawmakers and journalists, several news organizations announced they would only accept e-mail LTEs). Because the Internet broadly expanded the potential readership of editorials and opinion columns at small newspapers, their controversial editorials or columns could sometimes attract much more e-mail than they were used to handling — so much so that a few newspapers had their e-mail servers crash.

Editors are a frequent target of letter-writing campaigns, also called “[[astroturfing]],” or “fake grass-roots” operations where sample letters are distributed on the Internet or otherwise, to be copied or rewritten and submitted as personal letters.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dosomething.org/actnow/actionguide/how-organize-a-letter-writing-campaign Action Tips: Organize a Letter Writing Campaign] Dosomething.org&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jewishfederations.org/page.aspx?id=79797 Sample LTE] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120803065007/http://www.jewishfederations.org/page.aspx?id=79797 |date=2012-08-03 }} The Jewish Federations of North America&lt;/ref&gt;

Although LTE management gets little attention in trade journals, one organization, the National Conference of Editorial Writers, often includes essays on LTE management in its newsletter, The Masthead, and at its annual meetings.  Among the NCEW's strongest champions for LTEs was Ronald D. Clark of the St. Paul Pioneer Press, who wrote, "Consider letters as a barometer of how well (you are) engaging readers or viewers. The more you receive, the more you're connecting. The fewer you receive, the stronger the sign that you're putting the masses to sleep."

On the other hand many editors will allow the publication of anonymous letters where the details of name and address of the author are not printed, but are disclosed to the editor.  This can promote a debate of issues that are personal, contentious or embarrassing, yet are of importance to raise in a public debate.

Sometimes a letter to the editor in a local newspaper, such as the [[Dear IRS]] letter written by Ed Barnett to the ''[[Wichita Falls Times Record News]]'' in [[Wichita Falls, Texas]], will end up receiving attention from the national media.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.suntimes.com/business/1467702,w-dear-irs-texas-barnett-taxes030909.article 'Dear IRS' rant against taxes hits nerve], Chicago Sun-Times, March 9, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

==Misrepresentation==
Submitting a letter under a false name to [[shill]] in support or to criticize an opponent can have significant consequences. For example, Canadian politician [[Paul Reitsma]]'s career ended in scandal in 1999, after he signed letters addressed to newspapers as "Warren Betanko" praising himself and attacking his political opponents. His local paper wrote a [[wikt:front page|front-page]] story under the headline of "[[Member of the Legislative Assembly|MLA]] Reitsma is a liar and we can prove it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/disgraced-b-c-mla-reitsma-seeks-political-redemption-1.1028847|title=Disgraced B.C. MLA Reitsma seeks political redemption|date=September 24, 2011|newspaper=CBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 1966 [[Israel]], the [[Herut]] Party of then opposition leader [[Menachem Begin]] was shaken by scandal when letters sharply attacking Begin, which had been published in major dailies, were proven to have been authored by Begin's rivals for the party leadership and sent to the papers under various aliases and false names. As a result, the rivals were discredited and eventually expelled from the party, which helped buttress Begin's leadership position up to win the 1977 general elections and become [[Prime Minister of Israel]].

In the [[sport]] of [[cricket]], if a ball in play cannot be found or recovered, any fielder may call '''lost ball'''. The game then proceeds as described in Law 20 of the [[laws of cricket]].

This Law prescribes that the ball immediately [[Dead ball (cricket)|ceases to be in play]]. In cricket the same [[Cricket ball|ball]] is used for each delivery and only changed rarely: either at request of the fielding captain after a set number of fair deliveries (80 in [[Test cricket]]) or when the ball is damaged. Also, the wear on a ball determines how it behaves in the air and when it pitches. As a result of this, when 'lost ball' is called, Law 20 requires the [[Umpire (cricket)|umpires]] replace the ball with one which had comparable wear to the previous ball.

When 'lost ball' is called, the batting side keeps any penalty that would have been declared if the delivery was not fair (see [[no-ball]] and [[Wide (cricket)|wide]]) plus 6 runs, or whatever they have in fact run before the call of 'lost ball' was made.

A call of 'lost ball' is unusual in professional cricket, and nowadays only really happens in recreational games where cricket fields may include rabbit warrens, molehills or the like, or where there is a tree in the field of play and no local rule about what happens when it is hit. Previously 'lost ball' could only be called when the ball could not be found. This has resulted in some ridiculous local games where batsmen scored a large number of runs whilst the fielding side fetched a ladder to climb up a tree the ball had got lodged in. (The ball not being lost as it was readily visible.) The current version of the Law prevents this, as now 'lost ball' can also be called when the ball cannot be recovered without outside assistance.

'''Mathematics and architecture''' are related, since, [[mathematics and art|as with other arts]], [[architect]]s use [[mathematics]] for several reasons. Apart from the mathematics needed when engineering [[building]]s, architects use [[geometry]]: to define the spatial form of a building; from the [[Pythagoreanism|Pythagoreans]] of the sixth century BC onwards, to create forms considered harmonious, and thus to lay out buildings and their surroundings according to mathematical, [[aesthetic]] and sometimes religious principles; to decorate buildings with mathematical objects such as [[tessellation]]s; and to meet environmental goals, such as to minimise wind speeds around the bases of tall buildings.

In &lt;!--[[History of Science and Technology in China|Ancient China]], Needs section in article before we put this here--&gt;[[Ancient Egyptian architecture|Ancient Egypt]], [[Ancient Greek architecture|Ancient Greece]], [[Architecture of India|India]], and the [[Islamic architecture|Islamic world]], buildings including [[Egyptian pyramids|pyramids]], temples, mosques, palaces and [[mausoleum]]s were laid out with specific proportions for religious reasons. In Islamic architecture, [[Geometry|geometric]] shapes and [[Islamic geometric patterns|geometric tiling patterns]] are used to decorate buildings, both inside and outside. Some Hindu temples have a [[fractal]]-like structure where parts resemble the whole, conveying a message about the infinite in [[Hindu cosmology]]. In [[Chinese architecture]], the [[tulou]] of [[Fujian province]] are circular, communal defensive structures. In the twenty-first century, mathematical ornamentation is again being used to cover public buildings.

In [[Renaissance architecture]], [[symmetry]] and proportion were deliberately emphasized by architects such as [[Leon Battista Alberti]], [[Sebastiano Serlio]] and [[Andrea Palladio]], influenced by [[Vitruvius]]'s ''[[De architectura]]'' from [[Ancient Rome]] and the arithmetic of the Pythagoreans from Ancient Greece.
At the end of the nineteenth century, [[Vladimir Shukhov]] in [[Russia]] and [[Antoni Gaudí]] in [[Barcelona]] pioneered the use of [[hyperboloid structures]]; in the [[Sagrada Família]], Gaudí also incorporated [[hyperbola|hyperbolic]] [[paraboloid]]s, tessellations, [[catenary arch]]es, [[catenoid]]s, [[helicoid]]s, and [[ruled surface]]s. In the twentieth century, styles such as [[modern architecture]] and [[Deconstructivism]] explored different geometries to achieve desired effects. [[Minimal surface]]s have been exploited in tent-like roof coverings as at [[Denver International Airport]], while [[Richard Buckminster Fuller]] pioneered the use of the strong [[thin-shell structure]]s known as [[geodesic dome]]s.

==Connected fields==
[[File:CdM, presunto autoritratto di leon battista alberti, white ground.jpg|thumb|upright|In the [[Renaissance]], an [[architect]] like [[Leon Battista Alberti]] was expected to be knowledgeable in many disciplines, including [[arithmetic]] and [[geometry]].]]

The architects Michael Ostwald and Kim Williams, considering the relationships between [[architecture]] and [[mathematics]], note that the fields as commonly understood might seem to be only weakly connected, since architecture is a profession concerned with the practical matter of making buildings, while mathematics is the pure [[Number theory|study of number]] and other abstract objects. But, they argue, the two are strongly connected, and have been since [[Classical antiquity|antiquity]]. In Ancient Rome, [[Vitruvius]] described an architect as a man who knew enough of a range of other disciplines, primarily [[geometry]], to enable him to oversee skilled artisans in all the other necessary areas, such as masons and carpenters. The same applied in the [[Middle Ages]], where graduates learnt [[arithmetic]], geometry and [[aesthetics]] alongside the basic syllabus of grammar, logic, and rhetoric (the [[trivium]]) in elegant halls made by master builders who had guided many craftsmen. A master builder at the top of his profession was given the title of architect or engineer. In the [[Renaissance]], the [[quadrivium]] of arithmetic, geometry, music and astronomy became an extra syllabus expected of the [[Renaissance man]] such as [[Leon Battista Alberti]]. Similarly in England, Sir [[Christopher Wren]], known today as an architect, was firstly a noted astronomer.&lt;ref name=Ostwald1&gt;{{cite book |editor1=Williams, Kim |editor2=Ostwald, Michael J. |title=Architecture and Mathematics from Antiquity to the Future: Volume I: from Antiquity to the 1500s |publisher=Birkhäuser |year=2015 |isbn=978-3-319-00136-4 |pages=chapter 1. 1–24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Williams and Ostwald, further overviewing the interaction of mathematics and architecture since 1500 according to the approach of the German sociologist [[Theodor W. Adorno|Theodor Adorno]], identify three tendencies among architects, namely: to be [[revolutionary]], introducing wholly new ideas; [[reactionary]], failing to introduce change; or [[revivalist artist|revivalist]], actually going backwards. They argue that architects have avoided looking to mathematics for inspiration in revivalist times. This would explain why in revivalist periods, such as the [[Gothic Revival architecture|Gothic Revival]] in 19th century England, architecture had little connection to mathematics. Equally, they note that in reactionary times such as the Italian [[Mannerism]] of about 1520 to 1580, or the 17th century [[Baroque]] and [[Palladian]] movements, mathematics was barely consulted. In contrast, the revolutionary early 20th century movements such as [[Futurism]] and [[Constructivist architecture|Constructivism]] actively rejected old ideas, embracing mathematics and leading to [[Modernist]] architecture. Towards the end of the 20th century, too, [[fractal]] geometry was quickly seized upon by architects, as was [[aperiodic tiling]], to provide interesting and attractive coverings for buildings.&lt;ref name=Ostwald48&gt;{{cite book |editor1=Williams, Kim |editor2=Ostwald, Michael J. |title=Architecture and Mathematics from Antiquity to the Future: Volume II: The 1500s to the Future |publisher=Birkhäuser |year=2015 |isbn=978-3-319-00142-5 |pages=chapter 48. 1–24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Architects use mathematics for several reasons, leaving aside the necessary use of mathematics in the [[Architectural engineering|engineering of buildings]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Architectural Engineering Overview |url=http://www.careercornerstone.org/pdf/archeng/archeng.pdf |publisher=Sloan Career Cornerstone Center |accessdate=11 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Firstly, they use geometry because it defines the spatial form of a building.&lt;ref name=Leyton&gt;{{cite book |last1=Leyton |first1=Michael |title=A Generative Theory of Shape |date=2001 |publisher=Springer |isbn=978-3-540-42717-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Secondly, they use mathematics to design forms that are [[aesthetic|considered beautiful]] or harmonious.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Stakhov |first1=Alexey |last2=Olsen |first2=Olsen |title=The Mathematics of Harmony: From Euclid to Contemporary Mathematics and Computer Science |date=2009 |publisher=World Scientific |isbn=978-981-277-582-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; From the time of the [[Pythagoreanism|Pythagoreans]] with their religious philosophy of number,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Smith |first1=William |authorlink1=William Smith (lexicographer) |title=[[Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology]] |date=1870 |publisher=Little, Brown |page=620}}&lt;/ref&gt; architects in [[Greek architecture|Ancient Greece]], [[Ancient Rome]], the [[Islamic architecture|Islamic world]] and the [[Renaissance architecture|Italian Renaissance]] have chosen the [[proportion (architecture)|proportion]]s of the built environment – buildings and their designed surroundings – according to mathematical as well as aesthetic and sometimes religious principles.&lt;ref name=Vitruvius2009/&gt;&lt;ref name=Tennant/&gt;&lt;ref name=Rai/&gt;&lt;ref name=StAndrewsArchitecture/&gt; Thirdly, they may use mathematical objects such as [[tessellation]]s to decorate buildings.&lt;ref name=Utrecht&gt;{{cite web |last1=van den Hoeven |first1=Saskia |last2=van der Veen |first2=Maartje |title=Muqarnas: Mathematics in Islamic Arts |url=http://www.jphogendijk.nl/projects/muqarnas2010.pdf |publisher=Utrecht University |accessdate=30 September 2015 |date=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Cucker103&gt;{{cite book |last1=Cucker |first1=Felipe |title=Manifold Mirrors: The Crossing Paths of the Arts and Mathematics |date=2013 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-72876-8 |pages=103–106}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fourthly, they may use mathematics in the form of computer modelling to meet environmental goals, such as to minimise whirling air currents at the base of tall buildings.&lt;ref name=Freiberger/&gt;

====Vitruvius====

[[File:Giovanni Paolo Panini - Interior of the Pantheon, Rome - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|left|upright|The interior of the [[Pantheon (Rome)|Pantheon]] by [[Giovanni Paolo Panini]], 1758]]

The influential Ancient Roman architect Vitruvius argued that the design of a building such as a temple depends on two qualities, proportion and ''symmetria''. Proportion ensures that each part of a building relates harmoniously to every other part. ''Symmetria'' in Vitruvius's usage means something closer to the English term modularity than [[Reflection symmetry|mirror symmetry]], as again it relates to the assembling of (modular) parts into the whole building. In his Basilica at [[Fano]], he uses ratios of small integers, especially the [[triangular number]]s (1, 3, 6, 10,&amp;nbsp;...) to proportion the structure into [[Vitruvian module|(Vitruvian) modules]].{{efn|In Book 4, chapter 3 of ''[[De architectura]]'', he discusses modules directly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Vitruvius |title=VITRUVIUS, BOOK IV, CHAPTER 3 On the Doric order |url=http://www.vitruvius.be/boek4h3.htm|website=Vitruvius.be |accessdate=6 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} Thus the Basilica's width to length is 1:2; the aisle around it is as high as it is wide, 1:1; the columns are five feet thick and fifty feet high, 1:10.&lt;ref name="Vitruvius2009"&gt;{{cite book |author=Vitruvius |title=On Architecture |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lBLNbOp46CYC&amp;pg=PR9 |year=2009 |publisher=Penguin Books |isbn=978-0-14-193195-1 |pages=8–9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Dehio 1 Pantheon Floor plan.jpg|thumb|upright|Floor plan of the Pantheon]]

Vitruvius named three qualities required of architecture in his ''[[De architectura]]'', c. 15 B.C.: firmness, usefulness (or "Commodity" in [[Henry Wotton]]'s 16th century English), and delight. These can be used as categories for classifying the ways in which mathematics is used in architecture. Firmness encompasses the use of mathematics to ensure a building stands up, hence the mathematical tools used in design and to support construction, for instance to ensure stability and to model performance. Usefulness derives in part from the effective application of mathematics, reasoning about and analysing the spatial and other relationships in a design. Delight is an attribute of the resulting building, resulting from the embodying of mathematical relationships in the building; it includes aesthetic, sensual and intellectual qualities.&lt;ref name="WilliamsOstwald2015"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Williams |first1=Kim |last2=Ostwald |first2=Michael J. |title=Architecture and Mathematics from Antiquity to the Future: Volume I: Antiquity to the 1500s |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fWKYBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA42 |date=9 February 2015 |publisher=Birkhäuser |isbn=978-3-319-00137-1 |pages=42, 48}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====The Pantheon====
{{main article|Pantheon (Rome)}}

The [[Pantheon (Rome)|Pantheon]] in Rome has survived intact, illustrating classical Roman structure, proportion, and decoration. The main structure is a dome, the apex left open as a circular [[oculus]] to let in light; it is fronted by a short colonnade with a triangular pediment. The height to the oculus and the diameter of the interior circle are the same, {{convert|43.3|m|ft}}, so the whole interior would fit exactly within a cube, and the interior could house a sphere of the same diameter.&lt;ref name=Roth&gt;{{cite book | last=Roth | first=Leland M. | title=Understanding Architecture: Its Elements, History, And Meaning | publisher=Westview Press | location=Boulder | year=1992 | isbn=0-06-438493-4 |page=36}}&lt;/ref&gt; These dimensions make more sense when expressed in [[ancient Roman units of measurement]]: The dome spans 150 [[Roman foot|Roman feet]]{{efn|A [[Roman foot]] was about {{convert|0.296|m|ft}}.}}); the oculus is 30 Roman feet in diameter; the doorway is 40 Roman feet high.&lt;ref name=Claridge&gt;{{cite book | last=Claridge | first=Amanda | title=Rome | series= Oxford Archaeological Guides |publisher=Oxford University Press | location=Oxford Oxfordshire | year=1998| isbn=0-19-288003-9 |pages=204–5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Pantheon remains the world's largest unreinforced concrete dome.&lt;ref name=Lancaster&gt;{{cite book | last=Lancaster | first=Lynne C. | title=Concrete Vaulted Construction in Imperial Rome: Innovations in Context | publisher=Cambridge University Press | location=Cambridge | year=2005 | isbn=0-521-84202-6 |pages=44–46}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Renaissance===
{{further information|Renaissance architecture}}
[[File:Santa Maria Novella.jpg|thumb|Facade of [[Santa Maria Novella]], [[Florence]], 1470. The frieze (with squares) and above is by [[Leon Battista Alberti]].]]

The first Renaissance treatise on architecture was Leon Battista Alberti's 1450 ''[[De re aedificatoria]]'' (On the Art of Building); it became the first printed book on architecture in 1485. It was partly based on Vitruvius's ''De architectura'' and, via Nicomachus, Pythagorean arithmetic. Alberti starts with a cube, and derives ratios from it. Thus the diagonal of a face gives the ratio 1:{{radic|2}}, while the diameter of the sphere which circumscribes the cube gives 1:{{radic|3}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=March |first1=Lionel |title=Renaissance mathematics and architectural proportion in Alberti's De re aedificatoria |journal=Architectural Research Quarterly |date=1996 |volume=2 |issue=1 |pages=54–65 |doi=10.1017/S135913550000110X}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Sphere circumscribing a cube |url=http://www.mathalino.com/reviewer/solid-mensuration-solid-geometry/013-insciribed-and-circumscribed-sphere-about-cube-volume- |website=Mathalino.com Engineering Math Review |accessdate=4 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alberti also documented [[Filippo Brunelleschi]]'s discovery of [[linear perspective]], developed to enable the design of buildings which would look beautifully proportioned when viewed from a convenient distance.&lt;ref name=StAndrewsArchitecture/&gt;

[[File:Houghton Typ 525.69.781 - Serlio, 69.jpg|thumb|left|Architectural perspective of a stage set by [[Sebastiano Serlio]], 1569&lt;ref&gt;Typ 525.69.781, Houghton Library, Harvard University&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The next major text was [[Sebastiano Serlio]]'s ''Regole generali d'architettura'' (General Rules of Architecture); the first volume appeared in Venice in 1537; the 1545 volume (books 1 and 2) covered geometry and [[perspective (graphical)|perspective]]. Two of Serlio's methods for constructing perspectives were wrong, but this did not stop his work being widely used.&lt;ref name="Andersen2008"&gt;{{cite book |last=Andersen |first=Kirsti |title=The Geometry of an Art: The History of the Mathematical Theory of Perspective from Alberti to Monge |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8B_JeMxNUIkC&amp;pg=PA120 |year=2008 |publisher=Springer |isbn=978-0-387-48946-9 |pages=117–121}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Villa Pisani.jpg|thumb|right|[[Andrea Palladio]]'s plan and elevation of the [[Villa Pisani (Bagnolo)|Villa Pisani]]]]
In 1570, [[Andrea Palladio]] published the influential ''[[I quattro libri dell'architettura]]'' (The Four Books of Architecture) in [[Venice]]. This widely printed book was largely responsible for spreading the ideas of the Italian Renaissance throughout Europe, assisted by proponents like the English diplomat Henry Wotton with his 1624 ''The Elements of Architecture''.&lt;ref name=Ruhl&gt;{{cite web |last1=Ruhl |first1=Carsten |title=Palladianism: From the Italian Villa to International Architecture |url=http://ieg-ego.eu/en/threads/europe-on-the-road/educational-journey-grand-tour/carsten-ruhl-palladianism |publisher=European History Online |accessdate=3 October 2015 |date=7 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The proportions of each room within the villa were calculated on simple mathematical ratios like 3:4 and 4:5, and the different rooms within the house were interrelated by these ratios. Earlier architects had used these formulas for balancing a single symmetrical facade; however, Palladio's designs related to the whole, usually square, villa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Copplestone, Trewin |year=1963 |title=World Architecture |publisher=Hamlyn |page=251}}&lt;/ref&gt; Palladio permitted a range of ratios in the ''Quattro libri'', stating:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Wassell |first1=Stephen R. |title=The Mathematics Of Palladio's Villas: Workshop '98 |url=http://www.emis.de/journals/NNJ/Wassell.html |publisher=Nexus Network Journal |accessdate=3 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Palladio, Andrea |title=I quattro libri dell'architettura |author2=Tavernor, Robert; Schofield, Richard (trans.) |publisher=MIT Press |year=1997 |origyear=1570 |page=book I, chapter xxi, page 57}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|There are seven types of room that are the most beautiful and well proportioned and turn out better: they can be made circular, though these are rare; or square; or their length will equal the diagonal of the square of the breadth; or a square and a third; or a square and a half; or a square and two-thirds; or two squares.{{efn|In modern algebraic notation, these ratios are respectively 1:1, {{radic|2}}:1, 4:3, 3:2, 5:3, 2:1.}}&lt;!--end efn--&gt;}}

In 1615, [[Vincenzo Scamozzi]] published the late Renaissance treatise ''L'Idea dell'Architettura Universale'' (The Idea of a Universal Architecture).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Scamozzi, Vincenzo |title=The Idea of a Universal Architecture |origyear=1615 |year=2003 |author2=Vroom, W.

In the [[De Stijl]] movement, the horizontal and the vertical were seen as constituting the universal. The architectural form consists of putting these two directional tendencies together, using roof planes, wall planes and balconies, which either slide past or intersect each other, as in the 1924 [[Rietveld Schröder House]] by [[Gerrit Rietveld]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Rietveld Schröderhuis (Rietveld Schröder House) | work=World Heritage Centre | publisher=[[UNESCO]] | url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/965 | accessdate=13 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Mathematical Pyramid.svg|thumb|Base:hypotenuse (b:a) ratios for pyramids like the [[Pyramid of Khufu]] could be: 1:φ ([[Kepler triangle]]), 3:5 ([[3-4-5 triangle]]), or 1:4/π]]

The [[pyramid]]s of [[Ancient Egypt]] are [[Ancient Egyptian funerary practices|tombs]] constructed with deliberately chosen proportions, but which these were has been debated. The face angle is about 51°85’, and the ratio of the slant height to half the base length is 1.619, less than 1% from the [[golden ratio]]. If this was the design method, it would imply the use of [[Kepler triangle|Kepler's triangle]] (face angle 51°49’).&lt;ref name=Markowsky1992&gt;{{cite journal | author=Markowsky, George | url=http://www.math.nus.edu.sg/aslaksen/teaching/maa/markowsky.pdf | title=Misconceptions About the Golden Ratio | journal=The College Mathematics Journal |volume=23 | issue=1 | date=January 1992}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=Socrates G. | last=Taseos | title=Back in Time 3104 B.C. to the Great Pyramid | publisher=SOC Publishers | date=1990}}&lt;/ref&gt; However it is more likely that the pyramids' slope was chosen from the [[Special right triangles|3-4-5 triangle]] (face angle 53°8’), known from the [[Rhind Mathematical Papyrus]] (c. 1650 – 1550 BC); or from the triangle with base to hypotenuse ratio 1:4/π (face angle 51°50’).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=Midhat | last=Gazale | title=Gnomon: From Pharaohs to Fractals | publisher=Princeton University Press | date=1999 | page= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cooke concludes that Cantor's conjecture remains uncertain: he guesses that the Ancient Egyptians probably did know the Pythagorean theorem, but that "there is no evidence that they used it to construct right angles".&lt;ref name=Cooke2011/&gt;

[[Vaastu Shastra]], the ancient [[India]]n canons of architecture and town planning, employs symmetrical drawings called [[mandala]]s. Complex calculations are used to arrive at the dimensions of a building and its components. The designs are intended to integrate architecture with nature, the relative functions of various parts of the structure, and ancient beliefs utilizing geometric patterns ([[yantra]]), symmetry and [[Direction (geometry, geography)|directional]] alignments.&lt;ref&gt;Kramrisch, Stella (1976), The Hindu Temple Volume 1 &amp; 2, {{isbn|81-208-0223-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Vibhuti Sachdev, Giles Tillotson |title=Building Jaipur: The Making of an Indian City |date=2004 |isbn=978-1-86189-137-2 |pages=155–160}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, early builders may have come upon mathematical proportions by accident.

[[File:Plan of Meenakshi Amman Temple Madurai India.jpg|thumb|upright|Plan of [[Meenakshi Amman Temple]], [[Madurai]], from 7th century onwards. The four gateways (numbered I-IV) are tall [[gopuram]]s.]]

The mathematics of [[fractals]] has been used to show that the reason why existing buildings have universal appeal and are visually satisfying is because they provide the viewer with a sense of scale at different viewing distances. For example, in the tall [[gopuram]] gatehouses of [[Hindu]] temples such as the [[Virupaksha Temple, Hampi|Virupaksha Temple]] at [[Hampi]] built in the seventh century, and others such as the [[Kandariya Mahadev Temple]] at [[Khajuraho]], the parts and the whole have the same character, with [[fractal dimension]] in the range 1.7 to 1.8. The cluster of smaller towers (''shikhara'', lit. 'mountain') about the tallest, central, tower which represents the holy [[Mount Kailash]], abode of Lord [[Shiva]], depicts the endless repetition of universes in [[Hindu cosmology]].&lt;ref name=Rian/&gt;&lt;ref name=Yale&gt;{{cite web |title=Fractals in Indian Architecture |url=https://classes.yale.edu/fractals/Panorama/Architecture/IndianArch/IndianArch.html |publisher=Yale University |accessdate=1 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The religious studies scholar William J. Jackson observed of the pattern of towers grouped among smaller towers, themselves grouped among still smaller towers, that:

The [[Meenakshi Amman Temple]] is a large complex with multiple shrines, with the streets of [[Madurai]] laid out concentrically around it according to the shastras.

===Ancient Greece===
{{further information|Greek architecture|golden ratio|Pythagoreanism|Euclidean geometry}}
[[File:The Parthenon Athens.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Parthenon]] was designed using [[Pythagoreanism|Pythagorean]] ratios.]]

[[Pythagoras]] (c. 569 – c. 475 B.C.) and his followers, the Pythagoreans, held that "all things are numbers". They observed the harmonies produced by notes with specific small-integer ratios of frequency, and argued that buildings too should be designed with such ratios. The Greek word ''symmetria'' originally denoted the harmony of architectural shapes in precise ratios from a building's smallest details right up to its entire design.&lt;ref name=StAndrewsArchitecture&gt;{{cite web |last1=O'Connor |first1=J.

[[File:Parthenon-top-view.svg|thumb|upright|Floor plan of the Parthenon]]
The [[Parthenon]] is {{convert|69.5|m|ft}} long, {{convert|30.9|m|ft}} wide and {{convert|13.7|m|ft}} high to the cornice. This gives a ratio of width to length of 4:9, and the same for height to width. Putting these together gives height:width:length of 16:36:81, or to the delight&lt;ref name="Maor2007"&gt;{{cite book|last=Maor|first=Eli|title=The Pythagorean Theorem: A 4,000-year History|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Z5VoBGy3AoAC&amp;pg=PA19|year=2007|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=0-691-12526-0|page=19}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the Pythagoreans 4&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;:6&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;:9&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. This sets the module as 0.858&amp;nbsp;m. A 4:9 rectangle can be constructed as three contiguous rectangles with sides in the ratio 3:4. Each half-rectangle is then a convenient 3:4:5 right triangle, enabling the angles and sides to be checked with a suitably knotted rope. The inner area (naos) similarly has 4:9 proportions ({{convert|21.44|m|ft}} wide by 48.3&amp;nbsp;m long); the ratio between the diameter of the outer columns, {{convert|1.905|m|ft}}, and the spacing of their centres, {{convert|4.293|m|ft}}, is also 4:9.&lt;ref name=StAndrewsArchitecture/&gt;

The Parthenon is considered by authors such as [[John Julius Norwich]] "the most perfect Doric temple ever built".&lt;ref name=Norwich/&gt; Its elaborate architectural refinements include "a subtle correspondence between the curvature of the stylobate, the taper of the [[naos (architecture)|naos]] walls and the ''entasis'' of the columns".&lt;ref name=Norwich&gt;{{cite book |author=Norwich, John Julius |title=Great Architecture of the World |publisher=Artists House |year=2001 |page=63}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Entasis]]'' refers to the subtle diminution in diameter of the columns as they rise. The stylobate is the platform on which the columns stand. As in other classical Greek temples,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Penrose, Francis |title=Principles of Athenian Architecture |publisher=Society of Dilettanti |year=1973 |origyear=1851 |page=ch. II.3, plate 9}}&lt;/ref&gt; the platform has a slight parabolic upward curvature to shed rainwater and reinforce the building against earthquakes. The columns might therefore be supposed to lean outwards, but they actually lean slightly inwards so that if they carried on, they would meet about a mile above the centre of the building; since they are all the same height, the curvature of the outer stylobate edge is transmitted to the [[architrave]] and roof above: "all follow the rule of being built to delicate curves".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Stevens, Gorham P. |title=Concerning the Impressiveness of the Parthenon |journal=American Journal of Archaeology |volume=66 |issue=3 |date=July 1962 |pages=337–338 |doi=10.2307/501468}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The golden ratio was known in 300 B.C., when [[Euclid]] described the method of geometric construction.&lt;ref&gt;[[Euclid's Elements|Euclid. ''Elements'']]. Book 6, Proposition 30.&lt;/ref&gt; It has been argued that the golden ratio was used in the design of the Parthenon and other ancient Greek buildings, as well as sculptures, paintings, and vases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Archibald, R.

The [[Selimiye Mosque]] in [[Edirne]], Turkey, was built by [[Mimar Sinan]] to provide a space where the [[mihrab]] could be see from anywhere inside the building. The very large central space is accordingly arranged as an octagon, formed by 8 enormous pillars, and capped by a circular dome of {{convert|31.25|m|ft}} diameter and {{convert|43|m|ft}} high. The octagon is formed into a square with four semidomes, and externally by four exceptionally tall minarets, {{convert|83|m|ft}} tall. The building's plan is thus a circle inside an octagon inside a square.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Art and Architecture of Islam 1250-1800 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-mhIgewDtNkC&amp;pg=PA226 |publisher=Yale University Press |year=1995 |isbn=0-300-06465-9 |first=Sheila |last=Blair |first2=Jonathan M. |last2=Bloom}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The white marble [[mausoleum]], decorated with [[pietra dura]], the great gate (''Darwaza-i rauza''), other buildings, the gardens and paths together form a unified hierarchical design. The buildings include a [[mosque]] in red sandstone on the west, and an almost identical building, the Jawab or 'answer' on the east to maintain the bilateral symmetry of the complex. The formal [[charbagh]] ('fourfold garden') is in four parts, symbolising the four rivers of paradise, and offering views and reflections of the mausoleum. These are divided in turn into 16 parterres.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last=Koch | first=Ebba | title=The Complete Taj Mahal: And the Riverfront Gardens of Agra| edition=1st| publisher=Thames &amp; Hudson | isbn=0-500-34209-1| pages=24 and passim | date=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Taj Mahal complex was laid out on a grid, subdivided into smaller grids. The historians of architecture Koch and Barraud agree with the traditional accounts that give the width of the complex as 374 Mughal yards or [[gaz (measure)|gaz]],{{efn|1 gaz is about {{convert|0.86|m|ft}}.}} the main area being three 374-gaz squares. These were divided in areas like the bazaar and caravanserai into 17-gaz modules; the garden and terraces are in modules of 23 gaz, and are 368 gaz wide (16 x 23). The mausoleum, mosque and guest house are laid out on a grid of 7 gaz. Koch and Barraud observe that if an octagon, used repeatedly in the complex, is given sides of 7 units, then it has a width of 17 units,{{efn|A square drawn around the octagon by prolonging alternate sides adds four right angle triangles with hypotenuse of 7 and the other two sides of {{radic|49/2}} or 4.9497..., nearly 5.

[[Antoni Gaudí]] used a wide variety of geometric structures, some being minimal surfaces, in the [[Sagrada Família]], [[Barcelona]], started in 1882 (and not completed as of 2015).

For example, in the Passion Façade of Sagrada Família, Gaudí assembled stone "branches" in the form of hyperbolic paraboloids, which overlap at their tops (directrices) without, therefore, meeting at a point. In contrast, in the colonnade there are hyperbolic paraboloidal surfaces that smoothly join other structures to form unbounded surfaces.

==Defence==

===Europe===
{{further information|Star fort}}

The architecture of [[fortification]]s evolved from [[medieval fortification|medieval fortresses]], which had high masonry walls, to low, symmetrical [[star fort]]s able to resist [[artillery]] bombardment between the mid-fifteenth and nineteenth centuries. The geometry of the star shapes was dictated by the need to avoid dead zones where attacking infantry could shelter from defensive fire; the sides of the projecting points were angled to permit such fire to sweep the ground, and to provide crossfire (from both sides) beyond each projecting point. Well-known architects who designed such defences include [[Michelangelo]], [[Baldassare Peruzzi]], [[Vincenzo Scamozzi]] and [[Sébastien Le Prestre de Vauban]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Duffy, C. |year=1975 |title=Fire &amp; Stone, The Science of Fortress Warfare 1660–1860 |publisher=Booksales |isbn=978-0-7858-2109-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Chandler |first1=David |title=The Art of Warfare in the Age of Marlborough |date=1990 |publisher=Spellmount |isbn=978-0-946771-42-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The architectural historian [[Siegfried Giedion]] argued that the star-shaped fortification had a formative influence on the patterning of the Renaissance [[Urban planning|ideal city]]: "The Renaissance was hypnotized by one city type which for a century and a half—from Filarete to Scamozzi—was impressed upon all utopian schemes: this is the star-shaped city."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Giedion, Siegfried |authorlink=Siegfried Giedion |title=Space, Time and Architecture |publisher=Harvard University Press |origyear=1941 |date=1962 |page=43}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Chinese architecture]], the [[tulou]] of [[Fujian province]] are circular, communal defensive structures with mainly blank walls and a single iron-plated wooden door, some dating back to the sixteenth century. The walls are topped with roofs that slope gently both outwards and inwards, forming a ring. The centre of the circle is an open cobbled courtyard, often with a well, surrounded by timbered galleries up to five stories high.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=O'Neill |first1=Tom |title=China's Remote Fortresses Lose Residents, Gain Tourists |url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2015/01/150102-hakka-china-tulou-fujian-world-heritage-culture-housing/ |publisher=[[National Geographic (magazine)|National Geographic]] |accessdate=6 January 2017 |date=4 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mechanics' Institutes''' are educational establishments, originally formed to provide [[adult education]], particularly in technical subjects, to working men. Similar organisation are sometimes simply called [[Institute|Institutes]]. As such, they were often funded by local industrialists on the grounds that they would ultimately benefit from having more knowledgeable and skilled employees (such philanthropy was shown by, among others, [[Robert Stephenson]], [[James Nasmyth]], [[John Davis Barnett]] and [[Joseph Whitworth]]). The Mechanics' Institutes were used as 'libraries' for the adult working class, and provided them with an alternative pastime to gambling and drinking in pubs.

==Origins==
The world's first Mechanics' Institute was established in [[Edinburgh]], [[Scotland]] in October 1821 as the School of Arts of Edinburgh (later [[Heriot-Watt University]]), with the provision of technical education for working people and professionals. Its purpose was to "address societal needs by incorporating fundamental scientific thinking and research into engineering solutions". The school revolutionised access to education in science and technology for ordinary people.

The second Institute in Scotland was incorporated in [[Glasgow]] in November 1823, built on the foundations of a group started at the turn of the previous century by [[George Birkbeck]]. Under the auspices of the Andersonian University (est. 1796), Birkbeck had first instituted free lectures on arts, science and technical subjects in 1800.  This mechanics' class continued to meet after he moved to London in 1804, and in 1823 they decided to formalise their organisation by incorporating themselves as the Mechanics' Institute.

The first Mechanics' Institute in England was opened at [[Liverpool]] in July 1823.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=cXZKAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA152&amp;dq=liverpool+mechanics+july+1823&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=jT_mTrndKcfh8AOQyumHBA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=6&amp;ved=0CGQQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q=liverpool%20mechanics%20july%201823&amp;f=false Speeches of Henry, Lord Brougham] Vol. II, 1841, Lea and Blanchard, Philadelphia&lt;/ref&gt; The London Mechanics' Institute (later [[Birkbeck, University of London|Birkbeck College]]) followed in December 1823, and the Mechanics' Institutes in [[Ipswich]] and [[Manchester]] (later to become [[UMIST]]) in 1824.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Kidd, Alan J. |title=Manchester (Town and city histories) |publisher=Ryburn |location=Manchester |year=1993 |isbn=1-85331-016-6 | pages = 57–8}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the mid-19th century, there were over 700 institutes in towns and cities across the UK and overseas, some of which became the early roots of other colleges and universities. See for example the [[University of Gloucestershire]], which has the Cheltenham Mechanics' Institute (1834) and Gloucester Mechanics' Institute (1840) within its history timeline. It was as a result of delivering a lecture series at the Cheltenham Mechanics' Institute that the famous radical [[George Holyoake]] was arrested and then convicted on a charge of blasphemy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Politics in Mechanics' Institutes 1820–1850, Turner, C M, Thesis (PhD), 1980 |url= http://hdl.handle.net/2381/35680|website=Leicester University  Research Archives|publisher=Turner, C M, Leicester University}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Notes of Mr Hunt reporter August 15 1842, The Trial of George Jacob. Holyoake on an Indictment for blasphemy |url= https://www.bl.uk/ |website=British Library main catalogues|publisher=British Library }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Australia, the first Mechanics' Institute was established in [[Hobart]] in 1827, followed by the [[Sydney Mechanics' School of Arts]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sydneymsa.com.au|title=SMSA (Sydney Mechanics' School of Arts)|work=SMSA}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1833, [[Newcastle, New South Wales|Newcastle]] School of Arts in 1835, then the [[Melbourne]] Mechanics' Institute established in 1839 (renamed The [[Athenaeum, Melbourne|Melbourne Athenaeum]] in 1873). From the 1850s, Mechanics' Institutes quickly spread throughout [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] wherever a hall, library or school was needed. Over 1200 Mechanics' Institutes were built in Victoria but just over 500 remain today, and only six still operate their lending library services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Lowden, Bronwyn |title=Mechanics' Institutes, Schools of Arts, Athenaeums, etc.: An Australian Checklist – 3rd Edition |publisher=Lowden Publishing Co. |location=Donvale, Australia |year=2010 |isbn=978-1-920753-16-0 | pages = 64–111}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Industrial Revolution]] created a new class of reader in Britain by the end of the 18th century, 'mechanics,' who were civil and mechanical engineers in reality. The [[Birmingham]] Brotherly Society was founded in 1796 by local mechanics to fill this need, and was the forerunner of Mechanics' Institutes, which grew in England to over seven hundred in number by 1850.&lt;ref name="Kilgour, Frederick 1998, p. 99"&gt;Kilgour, Frederick, The Evolution of the Book. New York, Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1998, p. 99.&lt;/ref&gt;

G. Jefferson explains that: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;The first phase, the Mechanics Institute movement, grew in an atmosphere of interest by a greater proportion of the population in scientific matters revealed in the public lectures of famous scientists such as Faraday. More precisely, as a consequence of the introduction of machinery a class workmen emerged to build, maintain and repair, the machines on which the blessing of progress depended, at a time when population shifts and the dissolving influences of industrialization in the new urban areas, where these were concentrated, destroyed the inadequate old apprentice system and threw into relief the connection between material advancement and the necessity of education to take part in its advantages.&lt;ref name=Jefferson&gt;Jefferson, G.. Libraries and Society. Cambridge &amp; London, Great Britain: James Clark &amp; CO. LTD., 1969, p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

Small tradesmen and workers could not afford subscription libraries, so for their benefit, benevolent groups and individuals created "Mechanics' Institutes" that contained inspirational  and vocational reading matter, for a small rental fee. Later popular non-fiction and fiction books were added to these collections.  The first known library of this type was the Birmingham Artisans' Library, formed in 1823.  [[Image:Wakefield Museum.jpg|thumb|Wakefield's Mechanics' Institution (1825) put to a new use in the 21st century]]Some mechanics' libraries only lasted a decade or two, many eventually became public libraries or were given to local public libraries after the [[Public Libraries Act 1850]] passed. Though use of the mechanics' library was limited, the majority of the users were favourable towards the idea of free library use and service, and were a ready to read public when the establishment of free libraries occurred.&lt;ref name=Harris&gt;Harris, Michael. History of Libraries in the Western World. 4th ed. Metuchen, N.J.: Scarecrow Press, 1995, p. 153.&lt;/ref&gt;
Beyond a [[lending library]], Mechanics' Institutes also provided lecture courses, laboratories, and in some cases contained a museum for the member's entertainment and education. The [[Glasgow]] Institute, founded in 1823, not only had all three, it was also provided free light on two evenings a week from the local [[gas lighting|Gas Light Company]]. The London Mechanics' Institute installed gas illumination by 1825, revealing the demand and need for members to use the books.&lt;ref name="Kilgour, Frederick 1998, p. 99"/&gt;

[[File:Dirck Hals - Merry Company at Table - WGA11040.jpg|thumb|[[Dirck Hals]], ''Merry Company at Table'', 1627–29]]

'''Merry company''' is the term in [[art history]] for a painting, usually from the 17th century, showing a small group of people enjoying themselves, usually seated with drinks, and often music-making.  These scenes are a very common type of [[genre painting]] of the [[Dutch Golden Age painting|Dutch Golden Age]] and [[Flemish Baroque painting|Flemish Baroque]]; it is estimated that nearly two thirds of Dutch genre scenes show people drinking.&lt;ref&gt;Hagen, II, 395&lt;/ref&gt;

The term is the usual translation of the [[Dutch language|Dutch]] ''geselschapje'',&lt;ref&gt;Slive, 123&lt;/ref&gt; or ''vrolijk gezelschap'', and is capitalized when used as a title for a work, and sometimes as a term for the type. The scenes may be set in the home, a garden, or a tavern, and the gatherings range from decorous groups in wealthy interiors to groups of drunk men with prostitutes.  Gatherings that are relatively decorous and expensively dressed, with similar numbers of men and women, often standing, may be called ''Elegant Company'' or ''Gallant Company'', while those showing people who are clearly [[peasant]]s are more likely to use that word in their title.  Such subjects in painting are most common in Dutch art between about 1620 and 1670.

==Scope of the term==
[[File:Honthorst, Gerard van - Merry Company - 1623.jpg|thumb|right|Prostitution is clearly indicated in this scene by [[Gerard van Honthorst]] of 1623, complete with aged procuress, low cleavage, and a feathered headdress on the second girl.&lt;ref&gt;Discussed in Franits, 78–82&lt;/ref&gt;]] 
[[File:A merry company in a taverne Abraham II van den Hecke.jpg|thumb|right|[[Abraham van den Hecken]], ''A Merry Company in a Tavern'', 1640s]]

The definition of a "merry company" is far from rigid, and overlaps with several other types of painting. Portraits of family groups or bodies such as militia companies may borrow an informal style of composition from them, but works where the figures were intended to represent specific individuals are excluded.  There are normally between four and about a dozen figures shown, which typically includes both men and women, but may just consist of men, perhaps with female servants, as in the Buytewech illustrated. Contemporary Dutch descriptions of paintings from inventories, auction catalogues and the like, use (no doubt somewhat arbitrarily) other terms for similar compositions including "a ''buitenpartij'' (an outdoor party or picnic), a ''cortegaarddje'' (a barrack-room or '''guardroom scene'''), a ''borddeeltjen'' (a bordello scene), and a ''beeldeken'' or ''moderne beelden'' (a picture with little figures or modern figures)".&lt;ref&gt;Slive, 123&lt;/ref&gt; 

"Musical party" or "concert" is often used when some of the main figures are playing instruments.  More generally such works may be referred to as "company paintings" or  "company subjects" (but this is not to be confused with Indian [[Company painting]], a style patronized by the [[British East India Company]]).  Few if any titles used for 17th century genre paintings can be traced to the artist; those used by museums and art historians today may derive from a record in the [[provenance]] or be made up in modern times.

Paintings showing specific celebrations such as weddings or the festivities for [[Twelfth Night]], the main mid-winter celebration in the Netherlands, or the playing of specific games, are likely to have titles relating to these where the subject is still clear.  For example, a painting by [[Godfried Schalcken]] (1665–1670, [[Royal Collection]]) is known from his biography by his pupil [[Arnold Houbraken]] to represent ''The game of 'Lady, Come into the Garden''', and is so titled, although the rules of this are now unknown but "clearly involved the removal of clothes", at least by some male participants.&lt;ref&gt;Lloyd, 147; [http://www.royalcollection.org.uk/eGallery/object.asp?maker=12516&amp;object=405343&amp;row=1 "The game of 'Lady, Come into the Garden'"], Royal Collection online&lt;/ref&gt;  In ''La Main Chaud'' ("the hot hand") male participants just got smacked.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/paintings/follower-of-hieronymus-janssens-ladies-and-gentlemen-playing-la-main-chaude ''Ladies and Gentlemen playing La Main Chaude''], National Gallery, London. The game is shown in other paintings, including two by [[Jan Miense Molenaer]] with peasants. In the variant described at Schama, 439, it is the "rump" that gets smacked.&lt;/ref&gt;  Paintings showing the [[parable of the Prodigal Son]] in his prodigal phase are conceived as merry company scenes of the brothel type, though they are often larger, as was expected of a [[history painting]].

==Interpretation==
As with other types of Netherlandish genre painting, the body of merry company paintings include some with a clear moralistic intention, carrying a message to avoid excess in drink, lavish spending, low company and fornication.  Others seem merely to celebrate the pleasures of sociability, often with a socially aspirational element.  Many fall somewhere in between, are hard to interpret, and "contain within them an obvious contradiction between their goal of condemning certain types of excessive behaviour and the amusing and attractive aspect of this very behaviour and its representation".&lt;ref&gt;Alejandro Vergara, "The Subject Matter of Paintings of Domestic Interiors" in ''Vermeer and the Dutch Interior'', 2003, (orig. ''Vermeer y El Interior Holandes''), excerpted at [http://www.essentialvermeer.com/dutch-painters/dutch_art/subject_matter.html www.essentialvermeer.com]&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[File:Jacob Ochtervelt - Musical Company in an Interior - WGA16621.jpg|thumb|left|[[Jacob Ochtervelt]], ''Musical Company in an Interior'', c. 1670]]

Often the art historian wishing to interpret them has first to decide such questions as whether the scene is placed in a home, a tavern or a brothel, and if a tavern whether the women present are respectable or prostitutes, or whether the artist had a intention to convey definite meaning to his contemporary viewers on these questions at all.&lt;ref&gt;Franits, 20, 68–69, 78–82, 106–107, 124, 201; van de Pol; Schama, 462–464; Webster&lt;/ref&gt;  The titles given later to paintings often distinguish between "[[tavern]]s" or "[[inn]]s" and "[[brothel]]s", but in practice these were very often the same establishments, as many taverns had rooms above or behind set aside for sexual purposes: "Inn in front; brothel behind" was a Dutch [[proverb]].&lt;ref&gt;Friedman, Mira, "On Diderot's Art Criticism", [http://arts.tau.ac.il/departments/images/stories/journals/arthistory/Assaph2/assaph2-08friedman.pdf p. 123] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721134904/http://arts.tau.ac.il/departments/images/stories/journals/arthistory/Assaph2/assaph2-08friedman.pdf |date=2011-07-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Scenes with prostitutes do not reflect the realities of 17th century prostitution in many ways, but offer a conventionalized visual code.&lt;ref&gt;Schama, 466–480; van de Pol; Franits, 68–69&lt;/ref&gt;  The madam or (as art historians like to call them) "procuress" is always an aged crone, whereas court records for [[Amsterdam]] (the national centre for Dutch prostitution) show that most were still fairly young, and 40% in their twenties.&lt;ref&gt;van de Pol, 40% is Amsterdam 1650–99; Schama, 477&lt;/ref&gt;  The presence of a procuress figure is by itself sufficient to justify interpreting a painting as a brothel scene.&lt;ref&gt;Franits, 20, 177&lt;/ref&gt; Fine clothes (rented from the madam) and in particular feathers in headresses are said to be signifiers of prostitutes,&lt;ref&gt;van de Pol&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the more obvious loosened clothes, low cleavages, and a provocative frontal stance. But in the later part of the century demure downcast looks by the woman feature in many scenes thought to represent prostitution;&lt;ref&gt;Franits, 106–107, 124, 201&lt;/ref&gt; in the famously ambiguous threesome ''[[The Gallant Conversation]]'' by [[Gerard ter Borch]], the young woman is seen only from behind.&lt;ref&gt;Franits, 146–147&lt;/ref&gt;  Of one painting by [[Jacob Ochtervelt]], (c. 1670, now Cleveland, illustrated at left) Wayne Franits says: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;At first glance, the ''Musical Company in an Interior'' appears to be an elegant gathering of well-heeled youths [and women and a servant]... The picture exudes an aura of calmness and finesse.  Nevertheless, the series of female portraits on the wall behind the figures discloses the true nature of its subject.  There is strong evidence that actual brothels displayed portraits like these to assist clients in selecting their partners.&lt;ref&gt;Franits, 201; the pictures are high on the back wall and not easy to make out in reproduction.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[File:Simon de Vos - Merrymakers in an Inn - Walters 371741.jpg|thumb|[[Simon de Vos]], 1630s; according to the owning museum "Well-bred young ladies did not join parties in public inns; these smiling women are prostitutes".&lt;ref&gt;[http://art.thewalters.org/detail/23727 ''Merrymakers at an Inn''], [[Walters Art Museum]]&lt;/ref&gt;]]

According to [[Simon Schama]],

&lt;blockquote&gt;...when we are unsure whether we are looking at a picture of a home or a tavern, or whether what seems to be a tavern is actually a brothel, it may not be because we lack hard-and-fast clues to the artist's unambiguous intention, but because he meant us to be unsure. ... It would be futile to attempt to distinguish between scenes of good homely fun and public-house dissipation, because the figurative and actual territories were themselves deliberately mixed up. Where goings-on take place in a household or, conversely, children run around with gleeful worldliness in a tavern, there is a good chance that the picture is about the conmingling of innocence and corruption.&lt;ref&gt;Schama, 462–463&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Jan Steen]] owned a tavern for a period, living on the premises, and often included portraits of himself and members of his family in "genre" works.&lt;ref&gt;Schama, 463; Slive, 169-171&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gerrit van Honthorst]], who painted several scenes that, like the one illustrated here, clearly do show prostitution, married the daughter of the proprietress of a tavern and a wine merchant, who was a distant cousin and something of an heiress.  The traditional interpretation and title of his ''Prodigal Son'' in [[Munich]] has been challenged, with the assertion that it merely shows a "festive" tavern scene, despite the presence of an older woman and feathers in the girls' hair, often taken as diagnostic of a brothel scene.&lt;ref&gt;Hagen, I, 328–329; [[:File:Gerard van Honthorst 004.jpg|image]]&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[File:Duck-scène-galante.jpg|thumb|left|[[Jacob Duck]], 1635-40]]
[[File:Gerard van Honthorst - The Prodigal Son - WGA11660.jpg|thumb|right|[[Gerrit van Honthorst]] ''Prodigal Son''.]]

Elmer Kolfin, in "the first comprehensive study to date on the merry company in Dutch art during the first half of the seventeenth century" divides the pictures "into three iconographic categories: "idealistic", which present mainly positive views of the festive activities depicted; "moralistic", in which such activities are condemned from a moral point of view; and "satirical", in which they are held up for ridicule, but chiefly for comic rather than moralizing effect" seeing a movement away from moralistic to idealistic treatments from the 16th to the 17th century.&lt;ref&gt;Nevitt, reviewing Kolfin&lt;/ref&gt;  Other scholars see a large group of paintings as deliberately ambiguous or open in their meaning; the limited evidence we have suggests they were often displayed in the main rooms of their owners' houses.&lt;ref&gt;Nevitt; Webster; Schama, 461–464&lt;/ref&gt;

The exceptional freedom allowed to Dutch women amazed and usually horrified foreign visitors; according to the visiting Englishman [[Fynes Moryson]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;... mothers of good fame permit their daughters at home after they themselves go to bed, to sit up with young men all or most part of the night, banqueting and talking, yea with leave and without leave to walk abroad with young men in the streets by night.  And this they do out of a customed liberty without prejudice to their fame whereas the Italian women, strictly kept, think it folly to omit every opportunity they can get to do ill".&lt;ref&gt;Quoted by Schama, 403&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Many paintings have lightly worn allegorical schemes; a plate of food, tobacco pipe, musical instrument and a squeeze, kiss or slap will be enough to make any group into an ''Allegory of the Five Senses''.&lt;ref&gt;Franits, 27, 31&lt;/ref&gt;  Many may illustrate the endless supply of moralistic Dutch proverbs.

==Development of the type==
[[File:Jan van Hemessen - The Prodigal Son - WGA11358.jpg|thumb|left|[[Jan van Hemessen]], ''The Prodigal Son'', 1536]]

Courtly party scenes, typically of couples of young lovers in a "garden of love", were popular in the late Middle Ages, mostly in [[illuminated manuscript]]s and [[old master print|prints]] rather than [[panel painting]]s, and often as part of calendar series showing the months, or book illustrations.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.google.com/culturalinstitute/asset-viewer/merry-company/hgHsn_TInoCy4g?projectId=art-project&amp;hl=en-gb "Merry Company"], Istvan Nemeth, Museum of Fine Arts, Budapest, for Google Cultural Institute&lt;/ref&gt;  In the Renaissance such scenes tended to be given specific settings from religion or classical mythology, such as the ''[[Feast of the Gods (art)|Feast of the Gods]]'' which, unlike merry company scenes, was an excuse for copious amounts of nudity.  In 16th century [[Dutch and Flemish Renaissance painting]] traditions of genre painting of festivities or parties began to develop, most famously in the peasant scenes of [[Pieter Bruegel the Elder]], which were the first large paintings to have peasant life as their sole subject. 

There was also a tradition of moralizing urban scenes, including subjects such as the "Ill-matched Couple" and "Prodigal Son",&lt;ref&gt;Franits, 68–69, 72–75; van de Pol&lt;/ref&gt; and a court tradition of recording actual or typical entertainments at a particular court, with portraits of the leading personages.&lt;ref&gt;Vlieghe, 151, and more generally the "Festival book" and related traditions.&lt;/ref&gt;  The ''[[Feast of Herod with the Beheading of St John the Baptist]]'' by the German-[[Silesia]]n artist [[Bartholomeus Strobel]] (c. 1630-43, [[Prado]]) is an exceptionally large treatment of a subject often used since the 15th century to depict a courtly banquet. ''[[The Feast in the House of Levi]]'' by [[Paolo Veronese]] (1573, [[Gallerie dell'Accademia]], [[Venice]]) is another famous and huge treatment of a grand feast.

The "courtly company scene" with anonymous genre figures developed in the first years of the 17th century in both the Northern and Southern Netherlands, now separated by the [[Eighty Years War]].  As the subject type developed, so did differences between the two regions: Flemish painting covered a wider range of settings in terms of class, with peasant scenes remaining strongly represented, and many scenes showing court milieus.  Dutch painting concentrated on a class spectrum that might all be called middle-class, though ranging from elegant patrician companies to scruffy and rowdy groups.  Flemish scenes tend to have far more characters, and the tranquil middle class group of four or five people sitting round a table at home is not seen.&lt;ref&gt;Vlieghe, 154&lt;/ref&gt;  Whereas most Dutch paintings, except for those by the [[Utrecht Caravaggisti]], had small figures, the "monumental company scene" remained part of Flemish painting, with [[Jacob Jordaens]] producing several examples, especially of Twelfth Night festivities.&lt;ref&gt;Vlieghe, 166–171&lt;/ref&gt;  By the 1630s artists in both regions, but especially the north, tended to specialize in particular genres, and the merry company was no exception.&lt;ref&gt;Vlieghe, 7-8; Slive, 123&lt;/ref&gt;

==Painters==
[[File:Adriaen Brouwer - Inn with drunken peasants.jpg|thumb|left|[[Adriaen Brouwer]], ''Inn with Drunken Peasants'', 1620s]]

The first generation of Dutch painters included [[Willem Pieterszoon Buytewech]] (1591/1592–1624), who can claim to have invented the small interior merry company,&lt;ref&gt;Slive, 125–126; [https://www.google.com/culturalinstitute/asset-viewer/merry-company/hgHsn_TInoCy4g?projectId=art-project&amp;hl=en-gb Google art project, Budapest example]&lt;/ref&gt; Other early artists were [[David Vinckboons]] (1576–1629),&lt;ref&gt;Slive, 124–125; Franits, 53–57&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Esaias van de Velde]] (1587–1630), who was an even more significant pioneer of realistic [[landscape painting]], in a completely different style to his elegant garden parties.&lt;ref&gt;Slive, 125; 180–183&lt;/ref&gt;  The famous portraitist [[Frans Hals]] was attributed with a single very early merry company, a gallant picnic of about 1610, which was destroyed in [[Berlin]] in World War II;&lt;ref&gt;Slive, 123–125&lt;/ref&gt; he also painted a "close-up" genre depiction of three revellers.&lt;ref&gt;Liedke, 14-18&lt;/ref&gt;  His younger brother [[Dirck Hals]] (1591–1656) was a prolific specialist in small merry company groups.&lt;ref&gt;Slive, 125–127&lt;/ref&gt;

By about 1630 active painters included [[Hendrik Gerritsz. Pot]] (1587–1657), also a portraitist, [[Anthonie Palamedesz.]] (1601–1673), [[Pieter Codde]] (1599–1678), and [[Jacob Duck]] (1600–1667). Codde and Duck, with [[Willem Duyster]], were also painters of "guardroom scenes", which showed soldiers specifically, and became popular in the 1630s; as Lucy van de Pol notes, the sailors who made up a great part of the clientele of taverns and brothels, at least in Amsterdam, are very rarely represented.&lt;ref&gt;Slive, 126, 131–133; van de Pol; Franits, 57–64; Rosen covers the guardroom scene very fully&lt;/ref&gt;  

After about the mid-century many "company paintings" showed smaller and more quiet groups more firmly located in homes, often with more narrative elements and a greater concentration on effects of lighting and texture.  Pictures showing many of the same interests as "company" works, but just using couples or individuals become very common.  The paintings of [[Vermeer]], none of which quite fall into the category of "merry company" works, exemplify this trend, which is also seen in those of [[Gerard ter Borch]], [[Gabriel Metsu]], [[Gerrit Dou]], and [[Pieter de Hooch]].&lt;ref&gt;See Franits and Slive on these artists, via indices&lt;/ref&gt;  The works of [[Jan Steen]] (c. 1626–1679) maintained the tradition of rowdy drinking groups, but usually with a setting showing a specific occasion, or illustrating a proverb. Many show family groups, and often a self-portrait is included.&lt;ref&gt;Slive, 169–176; Franits, 203–214&lt;/ref&gt;  
[[File:El Jardín del Amor (Rubens) (alta resolución).jpg|thumb|[[Peter Paul Rubens]], ''[[The Garden of Love (Rubens)|Garden of Love]]'', 1630–35, the apotheosis of the outdoor courtly company]]

Flemish artists include [[David Vinckboons]], who moved to the north as a young adult, [[Frans Francken II]] with [[Hieronymus Francken I|his uncle Hieronymus I]] and [[Hieronymus Francken II|brother Hieronymus II]], [[Sebastian Vrancx]], [[Louis de Caullery]], all painting courtly scenes, often with small figures and much attention given to the architectural settings in or outside sumptuous palaces. [[Simon de Vos]] (1603–1676), painted smaller scenes closer to the Dutch style.&lt;ref&gt;Vlieghe, 150–152&lt;/ref&gt;

The Bruegel tradition of peasant scenes was continued by his sons [[Jan Brueghel I]] and [[Peter Brueghel the Younger]], mostly painting ''[[Kermesse (festival)|kermesse]]''-type festivities with large numbers of figures, most often outdoors.  Smaller groups in interiors were pioneered by the intensely naturalistic [[Adriaen Brouwer]], who was Flemish but also worked and sold in [[Haarlem]] in the north, where he greatly influenced [[Adriaen van Ostade]], the leading Dutch painter of peasants.  Brouwer's sordid scenes are short on merriment, but van Ostade softened and sentimentalized his style.&lt;ref&gt;Vlieghe, 149–150, 154–159, 162; Slive, 133–137&lt;/ref&gt;

[[David Teniers the Elder]], his son [[David Teniers the Younger]] as well as other members of the family included many peasant scenes in their large and varied output.&lt;ref&gt;Vlieghe, 160–162&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the works of all these painters lie outside the typical boundaries of the "merry company", in terms of the number of figures or their class, but many fall within; there was also a later generation of Flemish painters of peasant scenes.&lt;ref&gt;Vlieghe, 162–166&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Rubens]], who owned 17 paintings by Adriaen Brouwer, painted a few ''kermesse'' and other peasant scenes that are highly successful, despite their very heroic style.  He also painted a few large courtly company scenes, including his ''[[The Garden of Love (Rubens)|Garden of Love]]'', ([[Prado]], 1634-5).&lt;ref&gt;Vlieghe, 152, 159&lt;/ref&gt;

Apart from Jordaens and Rubens, Flemish painters of monumental company scenes included [[Theodoor Rombouts]] (1597–1637), who made several large paintings of card-players, [[Cornelis de Vos]], and [[Jan Cossiers]].&lt;ref&gt;Vlieghe, 167–171&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''nuno sa punso''' ("old man of the mound"), or simply '''nuno''' ("old man" or "grandparent"), is a [[dwarf (mythology)|dwarf]]-like nature spirit (''[[anito]]'') in [[Philippine mythology]].  It is believed to live in an anthill or [[termite]] mound, hence its name, literally 'Ancestor/Grandparent living in the anthill'.

==Description==
"The "nono"  are the spirits of the elderly. When a tree is to be felled, or a piece of virgin ground broken, or on many other occasions, permission is asked of the nono, in order to avoid the misfortune that would come from angering it. The ''nuno'' is described to be a small old man with a long beard, but differs from a [[dwarf (mythology)|duwende]] or dwarf of Philippine folklore.  The duwende is a playful [[hobgoblin]] who shows himself to children, while the ''nuno'' is a goblin easily angered that will do harm to those who damage or disturb his mound, and will seek retribution, for example by causing the foot of someone who kicked his mound to become swollen.  Nuno sa punso are also believed to inhabit places such as underneath large rocks, trees, riverbanks, caves, or a backyard.

==Magical abilities==
Nunos have the ability to curse trespassers. A curse may include the following:
* Swelling or pain on any part of the body
* Vomiting of blood
* Urinating black liquid
* Excessive hair growth on the back

In order for a nuno to successfully curse a person, the trespasser must be in close proximity to the nuno. If the trespasser is within range, the Nuno can spit on any part of the trespasser's body.  The trespasser will then experience aches or soreness on the affected part of the body, such as [[stomach]] pains, swollen genitals (after urinating on the mound), or swollen feet (after kicking the mound).

==Countering ''nuno'' curses==
It is a common belief in the Philippines that if modern [[medicine]] is unable to cure a particular illness, the ailment may be due to a ''nuno'''s curse.  The victim is brought to an ''[[albularyo]]'', a Philippine practitioner of [[traditional medicine]].  The ''albularyo'' will perform a type of divination known as ''pagtatawas''.  During this ritual, a burning piece of [[alum]] (''tawas'') or a candle is melted and poured onto a disc or spoon. The molten matter is then dribbled over a basin of water, allowing the alum or wax to cool and form shapes on the water’s surface. These will then be interpreted by the ''albularyo'' as signs pointing to the cause of the patient's illness and wheither a curse has transpired.

In order to be cured, the victim's family may be asked to provide an [[Votive offering|offering]] to the nuno such as fruits or other food, [[libation|drink]], or a material object. If the victim is still sick after the offering, it may be necessary to personally ask the nuno's forgiveness, which is believed to be a wise measure in order to prevent permanent [[Demonic possession|possession]] of the victim by an evil spirit, which could later cause insanity. 

It is also possible to kill the nuno by catching it and crushing its head between a person's fingers or thighs. This will remove any spell cast by the nuno. But this method is often not recommended as it could incur the wrath of a nuno's kin and friends.

Legends also state that placing an obese or plump woman by the roadside after midnight will lure the nuno out of hiding, thus allowing those afflicted to seek vengeance on the spirit. This is due to the belief that the nuno has an odd affinity for large-bodied mammals of the opposite sex.

==Precautions==
To avoid the wrath of a nuno sa Punso, children are reminded not to play outside between noon and three o'clock in the afternoon. They are also asked by their parents to come home before six o'clock in the evening.  Children are also instructed to avoid being noisy at places where nuno are believed to dwell.  Children are also warned to ask permission or give fair notice before passing by such places inhabited by the nuno, which is done by saying ''"tabi tabi po"''(literally ''"please be on the side"'' or ''"please move aside"'', that is, you tell the nuno to stand aside), or "please let me pass by" or "I mean no harm as I pass through your territory, Old Man of the Mound".

==Disrespect==
Although most people that believe in the spirit respect the nuno and will abide by the many unwritten rules that ensure a peaceful coexistence between [[human beings]] and nuno, others will, for a variety of reasons, actively seek to disrespect or offend them. A disrespectful person will purposely trample around in tall grassy areas, places where nuno are also believed to inhabit or will intentionally [[urinate]] on suspected nuno anthills to display dominance over the mound dweller.

An '''old master print''' is a [[work of art]] produced by a [[printing]] process within the Western tradition. The term remains current in the [[art trade]], and there is no easy alternative in English to distinguish the works of "[[fine art]]" produced in [[printmaking]] from the vast range of decorative, utilitarian and [[popular prints]] that grew rapidly alongside the artistic print from the 15th century onwards. Fifteenth-century prints are sufficiently rare that they are classed as old master prints even if they are of crude or merely workmanlike artistic quality. A date of about 1830 is usually taken as marking the end of the period whose prints are covered by this term.

The main techniques used, in order of their introduction, are [[woodcut]], [[engraving]], [[etching]], [[mezzotint]] and [[aquatint]], although there are others. Different techniques are often combined in a single print.  With rare exceptions printed on textiles, such as silk, or on [[vellum]], old master prints are printed on [[paper]]. This article is concerned with the artistic, historical and social aspects of the subject; the article on [[printmaking]] summarizes the techniques used in making old master prints, from a modern perspective.

Many great European artists, such as [[Albrecht Dürer]], [[Rembrandt]], and [[Francisco Goya]], were dedicated printmakers. In their own day, their international reputations largely came from their prints, which were spread far more widely than their paintings. Influences between artists were also mainly transmitted beyond a single city by prints (and sometimes drawings), for the same reason. Prints therefore are frequently brought up in detailed analyses of individual paintings in [[art history]].  Today, thanks to colour photo reproductions, and public galleries, their paintings are much better known, whilst their prints are only rarely exhibited, for conservation reasons.  But some museum [[print room]]s allow visitors to see their collection, sometimes only by appointment.

==History==

===Woodcut before Albrecht Dürer===
The oldest technique is woodcut, or woodblock printing, which was invented as a method for printing on cloth in China, and perhaps separately in Egypt in the [[Byzantine]] period. This had reached Europe via the [[Byzantine]] or [[Islamic]] worlds before 1300, as a method of printing patterns on textiles. [[Paper]] arrived in Europe, also from China via [[Islamic Spain]], slightly later, and was being manufactured in Italy by the end of the thirteenth century, and in Burgundy and Germany by the end of the fourteenth.&lt;ref&gt;Griffiths (1980), 16.&lt;/ref&gt; Religious images and [[playing cards]] are documented as being produced on paper, probably printed, by a German in [[Bologna]] in 1395.&lt;ref&gt;Field, Richard (1965). ''Fifteenth Century Woodcuts and Metalcuts''. Washington, D.C.: National Gallery of Art.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the most impressive printed European images to survive from before 1400 are printed on cloth, for use as hangings on walls or furniture, including altars and [[lectern]]s. Some were used as a pattern to embroider over. Some religious images were used as bandages, to speed healing.&lt;ref&gt;Hind (1935).&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest print images are mostly of a high artistic standard, and were clearly designed by artists with a background in painting (on walls, panels or manuscripts). Whether these artists cut the blocks themselves, or only inked the design on the block for another to carve, is not known. During the fifteenth century the number of prints produced greatly increased as paper became freely available and cheaper, and the average artistic level fell, so that by the second half of the century the typical woodcut is a relatively crude image. The great majority of surviving 15th-century prints are religious, although these were probably the ones more likely to survive. Their makers were sometimes called "Jesus maker" or "saint-maker" in documents. As with manuscript books, monastic institutions sometimes produced, and often sold, prints. No artists can be identified with specific woodcuts until towards the end of the century.&lt;ref&gt;Landau and Parshall, 1–6, quotes 2, 33–42. Mayor, 5–10.&lt;/ref&gt;

The little evidence we have suggests that woodcut prints became relatively common and cheap during the fifteenth century, and were affordable by skilled workers in towns. For example, what may be the earliest surviving Italian print, the "Madonna of the Fire", was hanging by a nail to a wall in a small school in [[Forlì]] in 1428. The school caught fire, and the crowd who gathered to watch saw the print carried up into the air by the fire, before falling down into the crowd. This was regarded as a miraculous escape and the print was carried to [[Forlì Cathedral]], where it remains, since 1636 in a special chapel, displayed once a year. Like the majority of prints before approximately 1460, only a single impression (the term used for a copy of an old master print; "copy" is used for a print copying another print) of this print has survived.&lt;ref&gt;Mayor, 10.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:5086 bassenge german 1480.jpg|thumb|left|230px|Anonymous German 15th century woodcut, about 1480, with hand-colouring, including (unusually) spots of gold. 5.2 x 3.9 cm (similar to the original size on most screens)]]
[[File:Saint Christopher. Woodcut. Wellcome V0031876.jpg|thumb|230px|A woodcut of St Christopher dated 1420]]
Woodcut blocks are printed with light pressure, and are capable of printing several thousand impressions, and even at this period some prints may well have been produced in that quantity. Many prints were hand-coloured, mostly in [[watercolour]]; in fact the hand-colouring of prints continued for many centuries, though dealers have removed it from many surviving examples. Italy, Germany, France and the Netherlands were the main areas of production; England does not seem to have produced any prints until about 1480. However prints are highly portable, and were transported across Europe. A Venetian document of 1441 already complains about cheap imports of [[playing cards]] damaging the local industry.&lt;ref&gt;Mayor, 14–17.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Block book|Block-books]] were a very popular form of (short) book, where a page with both pictures and text was cut as a single woodcut. They were much cheaper than manuscript books, and were mostly produced in the Netherlands; the ''Art of Dying'' ([[Ars moriendi]]) was the most famous; thirteen different sets of blocks are known.&lt;ref&gt;Mayor, 24–27.&lt;/ref&gt; As a relief technique (see [[printmaking]]) woodcut can be printed easily together with movable type, and after this invention arrived in Europe about 1450 printers quickly came to include woodcuts in their books. Some book owners also pasted prints into prayer books in particular.&lt;ref&gt;A number have survived pasted on the inside of the lids of boxes or chests, like  [http://gallica.bnf.fr/anthologie/notices/00340.htm this example].&lt;/ref&gt; [[Playing card]]s were another notable use of prints, and French versions are the basis of the traditional sets still in use today.

By the last quarter of the century there was a large demand for woodcuts for book-illustrations, and in both Germany and Italy standards at the top end of the market improved considerably. [[Nuremberg]] was the largest centre of German publishing, and [[Michael Wolgemut]], the master of the largest workshop there worked on many projects, including the gigantic [[Nuremberg Chronicle]].&lt;ref&gt;Landau and Parshall, 34–42. Mayor, 32–60. Bartrum (1995), 17–19.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Albrecht Dürer]] was apprenticed to Wolgemut during the early stages of the project, and was the godson of Anton Koberger, its printer and publisher. Dürer's career was to take the art of the woodcut to its highest development.&lt;ref&gt;Bartrum, 17–63. Landau and Parshall, 167–174.&lt;/ref&gt;

===German engraving before Dürer===
[[File:Martyrium des hl. Sebastian (Meister der Spielkarten).jpg|thumb|"Martyrdom of [[St Sebastian]]", engraving by the [[Master of the Playing Cards]], c. 1445]]

Engraving on metal was part of the [[goldsmith]]'s craft throughout the Medieval period, and the idea of printing engraved designs onto paper probably began as a method for them to record the designs on pieces they had sold. Some artists trained as painters became involved from about 1450–1460, although many engravers continued to come from a goldsmithing background. From the start, engraving was in the hands of the luxury tradesmen, unlike woodcut, where at least the cutting of the block was associated with the lower-status trades of carpentry, and perhaps sculptural wood-carving. Engravings were also important from very early on as models for other artists, especially painters and sculptors, and many works survive, especially from smaller cities, which take their compositions directly from prints. Serving as a pattern for artists may have been a primary purpose for the creation of many prints, especially the numerous series of [[Twelve apostles|apostle]] figures.

The surviving engravings, though the majority are religious, show a greater proportion of secular images than other types of art from the period, including [[woodcut]]. This is certainly partly the result of the relative survival rates—although wealthy fifteenth-century houses certainly contained secular images on walls (inside and outside), and cloth hangings, these types of image have survived in tiny numbers. The Church was much better at retaining its images. Engravings were relatively expensive and sold to an urban middle-class that had become increasingly affluent in the belt of cities that stretched from the Netherlands down the Rhine to Southern Germany, Switzerland and Northern Italy. Engraving was also used for the same types of images as [[woodcut]]s, notably devotional images and [[playing cards]], but many seem to have been collected for keeping out of sight in an album or book, to judge by the excellent state of preservation of many pieces of paper over five hundred years old.&lt;ref&gt;Landau and Parshall, 46–51, 64.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Maître E. S. Les Amoureux sur un banc de gazon L.211.jpg|thumb|[[Master E. S.]], "''Liebespaar auf der Rasenbank''"]]
Again unlike woodcut, identifiable artists are found from the start. The German, or possibly German-Swiss, [[Master of the Playing Cards]] was active by at least the 1440s; he was clearly a trained painter.&lt;ref&gt;Shestack (1967a), numbers 1–2. Mayor, 115–117.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Master E. S.]] was a prolific engraver, from a [[goldsmith]]ing background, active from about 1450–1467, and the first to sign his prints with a monogram in the plate. He made significant technical developments, which allowed more impressions to be taken from each plate. Many of his faces have a rather pudding-like appearance, which reduces the impact of what are otherwise fine works. Much of his work still has great charm, and the secular and comic subjects he engraved are almost never found in the surviving painting of the period. Like the Otto prints in Italy, much of his work was probably intended to appeal to women.&lt;ref&gt;Shestack (1967b). Shestack (1967a), numbers 4–19. Spangeberg, 1–3. Mayor, 118–123. Landau and Parshall, 46–50.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first major artist to engrave was [[Martin Schongauer]] (c. 1450–1491), who worked in southern Germany and was also a well-known painter. His father and brother were goldsmiths, so he may well have had experience with the burin from an early age. His 116 engravings have a clear authority and beauty and became well known in Italy as well as northern Europe, as well as much copied by other engravers. He also further developed engraving technique, in particular refining [[cross-hatching]] to depict volume and shade in a purely linear medium.&lt;ref&gt;Shestack (1967a), numbers 34–115.

The other notable artist of this period is known as the [[Housebook Master]]. He was a highly talented German artist who is also known from drawings, especially the Housebook album from which he takes his name. His prints were made exclusively in [[drypoint]], scratching his lines on the plate to leave a much shallower line than an engraver's [[Burin (engraving)|burin]] would produce; he may have invented this technique. Consequently, only a few impressions could be produced from each plate—perhaps about twenty—although some plates were reworked to prolong their life. Despite this limitation, his prints were clearly widely circulated, as many copies of them exist by other printmakers. This is highly typical of admired prints in all media until at least 1520; there was no enforceable concept of anything like copyright. Many of the Housebook Master's print compositions are only known from copies, as none of the presumed originals have survived — a very high proportion of his original prints are only known from a single impression. The largest collection of his prints is at Amsterdam; these were probably kept as a collection, perhaps by the artist himself, from around the time of their creation.&lt;ref&gt;Filedt Kok. Mayor, 124–129.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Meckenem.jpg|thumb|The first self-portrait, by the first businessman in the history of printmaking, [[Israhel van Meckenam]], with his wife]]
[[Israhel van Meckenam]] was an engraver from the borders of Germany and the Netherlands, who probably trained with Master ES, and ran the most productive workshop for engravings of the century between about 1465 and 1503. He produced over 600 plates, most copies of other prints, and was more sophisticated in self-presentation, signing later prints with his name and town, and producing the first print self-portrait of himself and his wife. Some plates seem to have been reworked more than once by his workshop, or produced in more than one version, and many impressions have survived, so his ability to distribute and sell his prints was evidently sophisticated. His own compositions are often very lively, and take a great interest in the secular life of his day.&lt;ref&gt;Landau and Parshall, 56–63. Mayor, 138–140.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The earliest Italian engravings===
Printmaking in [[woodcut]] and [[engraving]] both appeared in Northern Italy within a few decades of their invention north of the Alps, and had similar uses and characters, though within significantly different artistic styles, and with from the start a much greater proportion of secular subjects. The earliest known Italian woodcut has been mentioned above. Engraving probably came first to [[Florence]] in the 1440s; [[Vasari]] typically claimed that his fellow-Florentine, the goldsmith and [[niello]]ist [[Maso Finiguerra]] (1426–64) invented the technique. It is now clear this is wrong, and there are now considered to be no prints as such that can be attributed to him on anything other than a speculative basis. He may never have made any printed engravings from plates, as opposed to taking impressions from work intended to be nielloed. There are a number of complex [[niello]] religious scenes that he probably executed, and may or may not have designed, which were influential for the Florentine style in engraving. Some paper impressions and sulphur casts survive from these. These are a number of paxes in the [[Bargello]], Florence, plus one in the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]], New York which depict scenes with large and well-organised crowds of small figures. There are also drawings in the [[Uffizi, Florence]] that may be by him.&lt;ref&gt;Levinson. Landau and Parshall, 65.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Florence====
[[File:Battle of the Naked Men MetNY.jpg|thumb|[[Antonio Pollaiuolo]], "[[Battle of the Nudes (engraving)|Battle of the Nude Men]]"]]
Where German engraving arrived into a still [[Gothic art]]istic world, Italian engraving caught the very early Renaissance, and from the start the prints are mostly larger, more open in atmosphere, and feature classical and exotic subjects. They are less densely worked, and usually do not use cross-hatching. From about 1460–1490 two styles developed in Florence, which remained the largest centre of Italian engraving. These are called (although the terms are less often used now) the "Fine Manner" and the "Broad Manner", referring to the typical thickness of the lines used. The leading artists in the Fine Manner are [[Baccio Baldini]] and the "Master of the Vienna Passion", and in the Broad Manner, [[Francesco Rosselli]] and [[Antonio Pollaiuolo]], whose only print was the ''[[Battle of the Nudes (engraving)|Battle of the Nude Men]]'' (right), the masterpiece of 15th-century Florentine engraving.&lt;ref&gt;Langdale. Landau and Parshall, 65, 72–76.&lt;/ref&gt; This uses a new zigzag "return stroke" for modelling, which he probably invented.&lt;ref&gt;Langdale.&lt;/ref&gt;

A chance survival is a collection of mostly rather crudely executed Florentine prints now in the [[British Museum]], known as the Otto Prints after an earlier owner of most of them. This was probably the workshop's own reference set of prints, mostly round or oval, that were used to decorate the inside covers of boxes, primarily for female use. It has been suggested that boxes so decorated may have been given as gifts at weddings. The subject matter and execution of this group suggests they were intended to appeal to middle-class female taste; lovers and cupids abound, and an [[allegory]] shows a near-naked young man tied to a stake and being beaten by several women.&lt;ref&gt;Landau and Parshall, 89. Levinson.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Ferrara ====
The other notable early centre was [[Ferrara]], from the 1460s, which probably produced both sets of the so-called "[[Mantegna Tarocchi]]" cards, which are not playing cards, but a sort of educational tool for young humanists with fifty cards, featuring the Planets and Spheres, [[Apollo]] and the [[Muses]], personifications of the Seven [[liberal arts]] and the four Virtues, as well as "the Conditions of Man" from Pope to peasant.&lt;ref&gt;Landau and Parshall, 71–72. Spangeberg, 4–5.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Mantegna in Mantua====
[[File:Herkules und Antäus (Mantegna).jpg|thumb|left|"[[Hercules]] and [[Antaeus]]", [[engraving]], 1490–1500, School of Mantegna&lt;ref&gt;Levinson, no. 83.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

[[Andrea Mantegna]] who trained in [[Padua]], and then settled in [[Mantua]], was the most influential figure in Italian engraving of the century, although it is still debated whether he actually engraved any plates himself (a debate revived in recent years by [[Suzanne Boorsch]]). A number of engravings have long been ascribed to his school or workshop, with only seven usually given to him personally. The whole group form a coherent stylistic group and very clearly reflect his style in painting and drawing, or copy surviving works of his. They seem to date from the late 1460s onwards.&lt;ref&gt;Landau and Parshall, 65–71. Mayor, 187–197. Spangeberg, 16–17.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The impact of Dürer===
{{Main|Albrecht Dürer}}

In the last five years of the fifteenth century, Dürer, then in his late twenties and with his own workshop in Nuremberg, began to produce woodcuts and engravings of the highest quality which spread very quickly through the artistic centres of Europe. By about 1505 most young Italian printmakers went through a phase of directly copying either whole prints or large parts of Dürer's landscape backgrounds, before going on to adapt his technical advances to their own style. Copying of prints was already a large and accepted part of the printmaking culture but no prints were copied as frequently as Dürer's.&lt;ref&gt;Bartrum (2002). Bartrum (1995), 22–63. Landau and Parshall, see index. Mayor, 258–281.&lt;/ref&gt;

Dürer was also a painter, but few of his paintings could be seen except by those with good access to private houses in the Nuremberg area. The lesson of how he, following more spectacularly in the footsteps of Schongauer and Mantegna, was able so quickly to develop a continent-wide reputation very largely through his prints was not lost on other painters, who began to take much greater interest in printmaking.&lt;ref&gt;Pon. Landau and Parshall, 347–358. Bartrum (1995), 9–11.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Italy 1500–1515===
For a brief period a number of artists who began by copying Dürer made very fine prints in a range of individual styles. They included [[Giulio Campagnola]], who succeeded in translating the new style [[Giorgione]] and [[Titian]] had brought to [[Venice|Venetian]] painting into engraving. [[Marcantonio Raimondi]] and [[Agostino Veneziano]] both spent some years in Venice before moving to [[Rome]], but even their early prints show classicizing tendencies as well as Northern influence.&lt;ref&gt;Pon. Landau and Parshall, see index.&lt;/ref&gt; The styles of the Florentine [[Cristofano Robetta]], and [[Benedetto Montagna]] from [[Vicenza]] are still based in Italian painting of the period, and are also later influenced by [[Giulio Campagnola]].&lt;ref&gt;Levinson, 289–334, 390–414. Landau and Parshall, 65–102 (see also index). Mayor, 143–156, 173, 223, 232.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Giovanni Battista Palumba]], once known as "Master IB with the Bird" from his monogram, was the major Italian artist in [[woodcut]] in these years, as well as an engraver of charming mythological scenes, often with an erotic theme.&lt;ref&gt;Levinson, 440–455. Landau and Parshall, 199, 102.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The rise of the reproductive print===
[[File:Moses (Matham).jpg|thumb|Reproductive engraving by [[Jacob Matham]], in this case of a [[sculpture]], "[[Moses]]", by [[Michelangelo]], 1593]]

Prints copying prints were already common, and many fifteenth century prints must have been copies of paintings, but not intended to be seen as such, but as images in their own right. [[Andrea Mantegna|Mantegna]]'s workshop produced a number of engravings copying his ''Triumph of Caesar'' (now [[Hampton Court Palace]]), or drawings for it, which were perhaps the first prints intended to be understood as depicting paintings—called ''reproductive prints''. With an increasing pace of innovation in art, and of a critical interest among a non-professional public, reliable depictions of paintings filled an obvious need. In time this demand was almost to smother the old master print.&lt;ref&gt;Pon. Landau &amp; Parshall, chapter IV, whose emphasis is disputed by Bury, 9–12.&lt;/ref&gt;

Dürer never copied any of his paintings directly into prints, although some of his portraits base a painting and a print on the same drawing, which is very similar. The next stage began when [[Titian]] in Venice, and [[Raphael]] in Rome, almost simultaneously began to collaborate with printmakers to make prints to their designs. Titian at this stage worked with Domenico Campagnola and others on woodcuts, whilst Raphael worked with Raimondi on engravings, for which many of Raphael's drawings survive.&lt;ref&gt;Pon. Landau and Parshall, 117–146.&lt;/ref&gt; Rather later, the paintings done by the [[School of Fontainebleau]] were copied in etchings, apparently in a brief organised programme including many of the painters themselves.&lt;ref&gt;Jacobson, parts III and IV.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Italian partnerships were artistically and commercially successful, and inevitably attracted other printmakers who simply copied paintings independently to make wholly reproductive prints. Especially in Italy, these prints, of greatly varying quality, came to dominate the market and tended to push out original printmaking, which declined noticeably from about 1530–40 in Italy. By now some publisher/dealers had become important, especially Dutch and Flemish operators like [[Philippe Galle]] and [[Hieronymus Cock]], developing networks of distribution that were becoming international, and much work was commissioned by them.  The effect of the development of the print-selling trade is a matter of scholarly controversy, but there is no question that by the mid-century the rate of original printmaking in Italy had declined considerably from that of a generation earlier, if not as precipitously as in Germany.&lt;ref&gt;Landau and Parshall develop the traditional view of decline, which Bury contests in his Introduction, pp.&amp;nbsp;9–12, and seeks to demonstrate the opposite view throughout his work.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The North after Dürer===
[[File:5168 bassenge leyden.jpg|thumb|left|"The Milkmaid'", engraving by [[Lucas van Leyden]], 1510]]

Although no artist anywhere from 1500 to 1550 could ignore Dürer, several artists in his wake had no difficulty maintaining highly distinctive styles, often with little influence from him.   [[Lucas Cranach the Elder]] was only a year younger than Dürer, but he was about thirty before he began to make woodcuts, in an intense Northern style reminiscent of [[Matthias Grünewald]].  He was also an early experimenter in the [[chiaroscuro]] woodcut technique.  His style later softened, and took in the influence of Dürer, but he concentrated his efforts on painting, in which he became dominant in Protestant Germany, based in [[Saxony]], handing over his very productive studio to his son at a relatively early age.&lt;ref&gt;Bartrum (1995), 166–178.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Lucas van Leyden]] had a prodigious natural talent for engraving, and his earlier prints were highly successful, with an often earthy treatment and brilliant technique, so that he came to be seen as Dürer's main rival in the North. However, his later prints suffered from straining after an Italian grandeur, which left only the technique applied to far less dynamic compositions. Like Dürer, he had a "flirtation" with etching, but on copper rather than iron. His Dutch successors for some time continued to be heavily under the spell of Italy, which they took most of the century to digest.&lt;ref&gt;Landau and Parshall, 316–319, 332–333, 333 quoted.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Albrecht Altdorfer]] produced some Italianate religious prints, but he is most famous for his very Northern landscapes of drooping larches and firs, which are highly innovative in painting as well as prints.  He was among the most effective early users of the technique of [[etching]], recently invented as a printmaking technique by [[Daniel Hopfer]], an armourer from [[Augsburg]]. Neither Hopfer nor the other members of his family who continued his style were trained or natural artists, but many of their images have great charm, and their "ornament prints", made essentially as patterns for craftsmen in various fields, spread their influence widely.&lt;ref&gt;Mayor, 228, 304–308, 567. Bartrum (1995), 11–12, 144, 158, 183–197. Landau and Parshall, 323–328 (Hopfers); 202–209, 337–346 (Altdorfer).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Hans Burgkmair]] from [[Augsburg]], [[Nuremberg]]'s neighbour and rival, was slightly older than Dürer, and had a parallel career in some respects, training with [[Martin Schongauer]] before apparently visiting Italy, where he formed his own synthesis of Northern and Italian styles, which he applied in painting and woodcut, mostly for books, but with many significant "single-leaf" (i.e. individual) prints. He is now generally credited with inventing the coloured [[Chiaroscuro woodcut|chiaroscuro (coloured) woodcut]].&lt;ref&gt;Bartrum (1995), 130–146. Landau and Parshall, see index, 179–202 on the chiaroscuro woodcut.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hans Baldung]] was Dürer's pupil, and was left in charge of the Nuremberg workshop during Dürer's second Italian trip. He had no difficulty in maintaining a highly personal style in woodcut, and produced some very powerful images.&lt;ref&gt;Bartrum (1995), 67–80.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Urs Graf]] was a Swiss mercenary and printmaker, who invented the [[white-line woodcut]] technique, in which his most distinctive prints were made.&lt;ref&gt;Bartrum (1995), 212–221.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Little Masters===
[[File:The Little Fool.jpg|thumb|left|"The Little Fool" by [[Sebald Beham]], 1542, 4.4 x 8.1 cm]]

The [[Little Masters]] is a term for a group of several printmakers, who all produced very small finely detailed engravings for a largely bourgeois market, combining in miniature elements from Dürer and from [[Marcantonio Raimondi]], and concentrating on secular, often mythological and erotic, rather than on religious themes.  The most talented were the brothers [[Bartel Beham]] and the longer-lived [[Sebald Beham]].  Like [[Georg Pencz]], they came from Nuremberg and were expelled by the council for [[atheism]] for a period.  The other principal member of the group was [[Heinrich Aldegrever]], a convinced [[Lutheran]] with [[Anabaptist]] leanings, who was perhaps therefore forced to spend much of his time producing ornament prints.&lt;ref&gt;Bartrum (1995), 99–129. Mayor, 315–317. Landau and Parshall, 315–316.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another convinced Protestant, [[Hans Holbein the Younger]], spent most of his adult career in England, then and for long after too primitive as both a market and in technical assistance to support fine printmaking. Whilst the famous blockcutter Hans Lützelburger was alive, he created from Holbein's designs the famous small woodcut series of the ''Dance of Death''. Another Holbein series, of ninety-one Old Testament scenes, in a much simpler style, was the most popular of attempts by several artists to create Protestant religious imagery. Both series were published in [[Lyon]] in France by a German publisher, having been created in [[Switzerland]].&lt;ref&gt;Bartrum (1995), 221–237.&lt;/ref&gt;

After the deaths of this very brilliant generation, both the quality and quantity of German original printmaking suffered a strange collapse; perhaps it became impossible to sustain a convincing Northern style in the face of overwhelming Italian productions in a "commoditized" Renaissance style. The Netherlands now became more important for the production of prints, which would remain the case until the late 18th century.&lt;ref&gt;Bartrum (1995), 12–13.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mannerist printmaking==
[[File:5136 bassenge ghisi.jpg|thumb|left|"[[Hercules]]", engraving by [[Giorgio Ghisi]], after Bertani, 1558]]

Some Italian printmakers went in a very different direction to either Raimondi and his followers, or the Germans, and used the medium for experimentation and very personal work. [[Parmigianino]] produced some etchings himself, and also worked closely with [[Ugo da Carpi]] on chiaroscuro woodcuts and other prints.&lt;ref&gt;Landau and Parshall, 146–161.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Giorgio Ghisi]] was the major printmaker of the Mantuan school, which preserved rather more individuality than Rome.  Much of his work was reproductive, but his original prints are often very fine.  He visited Antwerp, a reflection of the power the publishers there now had over what was now a European market for prints. A number of printmakers, mostly in etching, continued to produce excellent prints, but mostly as a sideline to either painting or reproductive printmaking.  They include [[Battista Franco]], [[Il Schiavone]], [[Federico Barocci]] and [[Ventura Salimbeni]], who only produced nine prints, presumably because it did not pay. [[Annibale Carracci]] and his cousin [[Ludovico Carracci|Ludovico]] produced a few influential etchings, while Annibale's brother Agostino engraved. Both brothers influenced [[Guido Reni]] and other Italian artists of the full [[Baroque]] period in the next century.&lt;ref&gt;Bury. Reed and Walsh, 105–114 on Annibale and subsequent artists in etching. Mayor, 410, 516.&lt;/ref&gt;

===France===
The Italian artists known as the [[School of Fontainebleau]] were hired in the 1530s by King [[Francis I of France]] to decorate his showpiece Chateau at Fontainebleau. In the course of the long project, etchings were produced, in unknown circumstances but apparently in Fontainebleau itself and mostly in the 1540s, mostly recording wall-paintings and plasterwork in the Chateau (much now destroyed). Technically they are mostly rather poor—dry and uneven—but the best powerfully evoke the strange and sophisticated atmosphere of the time.  Many of the best are by [[Leon Davent]] to designs by [[Primaticcio]], or [[Antonio Fantuzzi]]. Several of the artists, including Davent, later went to Paris and continued to produce prints there.&lt;ref&gt;Jacobson, parts III and IV. Mayor, 354–357.&lt;/ref&gt;

Previously the only consistent printmaker of stature in France had been [[Jean Duvet]], a goldsmith whose highly personal style seems halfway between Dürer and [[William Blake]].  His plates are extremely crowded, not conventionally well-drawn, but full of intensity; the opposite of the languorous elegance of the Fontainebleau prints, which were to have the greater effect on French printmaking. His prints date from 1520 to 1555, when he was seventy, and completed his masterpiece, the twenty-three prints of the Apocalypse.&lt;ref&gt;Marqusee. Jacobson, part II. Mayor, 358–359.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Netherlands===
[[File:GoltziusFarneseHerc.jpg|thumb|The "[[Farnese Hercules]]", engraving by [[Hendrick Goltzius|Goltzius]]]]

[[Cornelius Cort]] was an Antwerp engraver, trained in Cock's publishing house, with a controlled but vigorous style, and excellent at depicting dramatic lighting effects. He went to Italy and in 1565 was retained by [[Titian]] to produce prints of his paintings (Titian having secured his "privileges" or rights to exclusively reproduce his own works).  Titian took considerable trouble to get the effect he wanted; he said that Cort could not work from the painting alone, so he produced special [[drawing]]s for him to use. Eventually, the results were highly effective and successful, and after Titian's death Cort moved to Rome, where he taught a number of the most successful printmakers of the next generation, notably [[Hendrik Goltzius]], [[Francesco Villamena]] and [[Agostino Carracci]], the last major Italian artist to resist the spread of etching.&lt;ref&gt;Mayor, 403–407, 410.&lt;/ref&gt;

Goltzius, arguably the last great engraver, took Cort's style to its furthest point. Because of a childhood accident, he drew with his whole arm, and his use of the swelling line, altering the profile of the burin to thicken or diminish the line as it moved, is unmatched.  He was extraordinarily prolific, and the artistic, if not the technical, quality of his work is very variable, but his finest prints look forward to the energy of Rubens, and are as sensuous in their use of line as he is in paint.&lt;ref&gt;Mayor, 419–421. Spangeberg, 107–108.&lt;/ref&gt;

At the same time [[Pieter Brueghel the elder]], another Cort-trained artist, who escaped to paint, was producing prints in a totally different style; beautifully drawn but simply engraved.  He only etched one plate himself, a superb landscape, the ''Rabbit Hunters'', but produced many drawings for the Antwerp specialists to work up, of peasant life, satires, and newsworthy events.&lt;ref&gt;Mayor, 422–426.&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, numerous other engravers in the Netherlands continued to produce vast numbers of reproductive and illustrative prints of widely varying degrees of quality and appeal—the two by no means always going together. Notable dynasties, often publishers as well as artists,  include the [[Wierix family]], the Saenredams, and [[Aegidius Sadeler]] and several of his relations. [[Philippe Galle]] founded another long-lived family business. [[Theodor de Bry]] specialised in illustrating books on new colonial areas.&lt;ref&gt;Mayor, 373–376, 408–410.&lt;/ref&gt;

==17th century==
[[File:Rembrandt aux yeux hagards.jpg|thumb|left|Self-portrait by [[Rembrandt]], 1630]]

The 17th century saw a continuing increase in the volume of commercial and reproductive printmaking; [[Rubens]], like Titian before him, took great pains in adapting the trained engravers in his workshop to the particular style he wanted, though several found his demands too much and left.&lt;ref&gt;Mayor, 427–432.&lt;/ref&gt; The generation after him produced a number of widely dispersed printmakers with very individual and personal styles; by now etching had become the normal medium for such artists.

[[Rembrandt]] bought a printing-press for his house in the days of his early prosperity, and continued to produce etchings (always so called collectively, although Rembrandt mixed techniques by adding engraving and drypoint to some of his etchings) until his bankruptcy, when he lost both house and press.  Fortunately his prints have always been keenly collected, and what seems to be a high proportion of his intermediate states have survived, often in only one or two impressions. He was clearly very directly involved in the printing process himself, and probably selectively wiped the plate of ink himself to produce effects ''surface tone'' on many impressions.  He also experimented continually with the effects of different papers. He produced prints on a wider range of subjects than his paintings, with several pure landscapes, many self-portraits that are often more extravagantly fanciful than his painted ones, some erotic (at any rate obscene) subjects, and a great number of religious prints. He became increasingly interested in strong lighting effects, and very dark backgrounds. His reputation as the greatest etcher in the history of the medium was established in his lifetime, and never questioned since. Few of his paintings left Holland whilst he lived, but his prints were circulated throughout Europe, and his wider reputation was initially based on them alone.&lt;ref&gt;White; Mayor, 472–505; Spangeberg, 164–168.&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of other [[Dutch Golden Age painting|Dutch artists of the century]]  produced original prints of quality, mostly sticking to the same categories of genre they painted.  The eccentric [[Hercules Seghers]] and [[Jacob van Ruysdael]] produced landscapes in very small quantities, [[Nicolaes Berchem]] and [[Karel Dujardin]] Italianate landscapes with animals and figures, and [[Adriaen van Ostade]] peasant scenes.  None was very prolific, but the Italianate landscape was the most popular type of subject; Berchem had a greater income from his prints than his paintings.&lt;ref&gt;Mayor, 467–471. Spangeberg, 156–158 (Seghers), 170 (van Ostade), 177 (Berchem).&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Die Auferweckung das Lazarus (Castiglione).jpg|thumb|"The Raising of Lazarus", etching by [[Giovanni Benedetto Castiglione|Castiglione]]]]
[[File:Jacques Callot Massacre des Innocents.jpg|thumb|"Massacre of the Innocents", by [[Jacques Callot|Callot]], 13.7 x 10.5 cm, showing the use of multiple stoppings-out]]

[[Giovanni Benedetto Castiglione]] grew up in [[Genoa]] and was greatly influenced by the stays there of Rubens and [[van Dyck]] when he was a young artist. His etching technique was extremely fluent, and in all mediums he often repeats the same few subjects in a large number of totally different compositions. His early prints include a number of bravura treatments of classical and pastoral themes, whilst later religious subjects predominate.  He also produced a large series of small heads of exotically dressed men, which were often used by other artists. He was technically innovative, inventing the [[monotype]] and also the [[oil sketch]] intended to be a final product. He, like Rembrandt, was interested in [[chiaroscuro]] effects (contrasts of light and dark), using a number of very different approaches.&lt;ref&gt;Reed and Wallace, 262–271. Mayor, 526–527.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jusepe de Ribera]] may have learned etching in Rome, but all his fewer than thirty prints were made in [[Naples]] during the 1620s when his career as a painter seems to have been in the doldrums.  When the painting commissions began to flow again, he all but abandoned printmaking. His plates were sold after his death to a Rome publisher, who made a better job of marketing them than Ribera himself. His powerful and direct style developed almost immediately, and his subjects and style remain close to those of his paintings.&lt;ref&gt;Reed and Wallace, 279–285.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jacques Bellange]] was a court painter in [[Duchy of Lorraine|Lorraine]], a world that was to vanish abruptly in the [[Thirty Years War]] shortly after his death. No surviving painting of his can be identified with confidence, and most of those sometimes attributed to him are unimpressive. His prints, mostly religious, are Baroque extravaganzas that were regarded with horror by many 19th century critics, but have come strongly back into fashion—the very different Baroque style of another Lorraine artist [[Georges de La Tour]] has enjoyed a comparable revival. He was the first Lorraine printmaker (or artist) of stature, and must have influenced the younger [[Jacques Callot]], who remained in Lorraine but was published in [[Paris]], where he greatly influenced French printmaking.&lt;ref&gt;Griffiths and Hartley. Jacobson, part X. Mayor, 453–460.&lt;/ref&gt;

Callot's technical innovations in improving the recipes for etching ground were crucial in allowing etching to rival the detail of engraving, and in the long term spelt the end of artistic engraving. Previously the unreliable nature of the grounds used meant that artists could not risk investing too much effort in an etched plate, as the work might be ruined by leaks in the ground. Equally, multiple stoppings-out, enabling lines etched to different depths by varying lengths of exposure to the acid, had been too risky.&lt;ref&gt;Mayor, 455–460.&lt;/ref&gt; Callot led the way in exploiting the new possibilities; most of his etchings are small but full of tiny detail, and he developed a sense of recession in landscape backgrounds in etching with multiple bitings to etch the background more lightly than the foreground. He also used a special etching needle called an ''échoppe'' to produce swelling lines like those created by the burin in an engraving, and also reinforced the etched lines with a burin after biting; which soon became common practice among etchers.  Callot etched a great variety of subjects in over 1400 prints, from grotesques to his tiny but extremely powerful series ''[[Les Grandes Misères de la guerre]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Hind (1923), 158–160.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Abraham Bosse]], a Parisian illustrative etcher popularized Callot's methods in a hugely successful manual for students. His own work is successful in his declared aim of making etchings look like engravings, and is highly evocative of French life at the middle of the century. 
[[File:6409 bassenge2vaillerant.jpg|thumb|left|Early [[mezzotint]] by [[Wallerant Vaillant]], Siegen's assistant or tutor]]

[[Wenzel Hollar]] was a [[Bohemia]]n ([[Czechs|Czech]]) artist who fled his country in the Thirty Years War, settling mostly in England (he was besieged at [[Basing House]] in the [[English Civil War]], and then followed his Royalist patron into a new exile in Antwerp, where he worked with a number of the large publishers there). He produced great numbers of etchings in a straightforward realist style, many topographical, including large [[Bird's-eye view|aerial views]], portraits, and others showing costumes, occupations and pastimes.&lt;ref&gt;Mayor, 344.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Stefano della Bella]] was something of an Italian counterpart to Callot, producing many very detailed small etchings, but also larger and freer works, closer to the Italian drawing tradition.&lt;ref&gt;Reed and Wallace, 234–243. Mayor, 520–521, 538, 545.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Anthony van Dyck]] produced only a large series of portrait prints of contemporary notables, the ''Iconographia'' for which he only etched a few of the heads himself, but in a brilliant style, that had great influence on 19th century etching.&lt;ref&gt;Mayor, 433–435.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ludwig von Siegen]] was a German soldier and courtier, who invented the technique of [[mezzotint]], which in the hands of better artists than he was to become an important, mostly reproductive, technique in the 18th century.&lt;ref&gt;Griffiths (1980), 83–88. Mayor, 511–515.&lt;/ref&gt;

The last third of the century produced relatively little original printmaking of great interest, although illustrative printmaking reached a high level of quality. French portrait prints, most often copied from paintings, were the finest in Europe and often extremely brilliant, with the school including both etching and engraving, often in the same work. The most important artists were [[Claude Mellan]], an etcher from the 1630s onwards, and his contemporary {{Interlanguage link multi|Jean Morin (engraver)|fr|3=Jean Morin (artiste)}}, whose combination of engraving and etching influenced many later artists.  [[Robert Nanteuil]] was official portrait engraver to [[Louis XIV]], and produced over two hundred brilliantly engraved portraits of the court and other notable French figures.&lt;ref&gt;Mayor, 289–290.&lt;/ref&gt;

==18th century==
[[File:Piranesi-Ponte-Milvio.jpg|thumb|One of [[Giovanni Battista Piranesi|Piranesi]]'s views of Rome]]

The extremely popular engravings of [[William Hogarth]] in England were little concerned with technical printmaking effects; in many he was producing reproductive prints of his own paintings (a surprisingly rare thing to do) that only set out to convey his crowded moral compositions as clearly as possible. It would not be possible, without knowing, to distinguish these from his original prints, which have the same aim. He priced his prints to reach a middle and even upper working-class market, and was brilliantly successful in this.&lt;ref&gt;Mayor, 550–555.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Canaletto]] was also a highly successful painter, and though his relatively few prints are [[vedute]], they are rather different from his painted ones, and fully aware of the possibilities of the etching medium.  [[Giovanni Battista Piranesi|Piranesi]] was primarily a printmaker, a technical innovator who extended the life of his plates beyond what was previously possible.  His ''Views of Rome''—well over a hundred huge plates—were backed by a serious understanding of Roman and modern architecture and brilliantly exploit the drama both of the ancient ruins and Baroque Rome.  Many prints of Roman views had been produced before, but Piranesi's vision has become the benchmark.  [[Gianbattista Tiepolo]], near the end of his long career produced some brilliant etchings, subjectless capricci of a landscape of classical ruins and pine trees, populated by an elegant band of beautiful young men and women, philosophers in fancy dress, soldiers and satyrs.  Bad-tempered owls look down on the scenes.  His son Domenico produced many more etchings in a similar style, but of much more conventional subjects, often reproducing his father's paintings.&lt;ref&gt;Mayor, 576–584.&lt;/ref&gt;

The technical means at the disposal of reproductive printmakers continued to develop, and many superb and sought-after prints were produced by the English [[mezzotint]]ers (many of them in fact Irish) and by French printmakers in a variety of techniques.&lt;ref&gt;Griffiths (1996), 134–158 on English mezzotints and their collectors.&lt;/ref&gt; French attempts to produce high quality colour prints were successful by the last part of the century, although the techniques were expensive.  Prints could now be produced that closely resembled [[drawing]]s in [[crayon]] or [[watercolour]]s. Some original prints were produced in these methods, but few major artists used them.&lt;ref&gt;Spangeberg, 221–222. Mayor, 591–600.&lt;/ref&gt;

The rise of the [[novel]] led to a demand for small, highly expressive, illustrations for them.  Many fine French and other artists specialised in these, but clearly standing out from the pack is the work of [[Daniel Chodowiecki]], a German of Polish origin who produced over a thousand small etchings. Mainly illustrations for books, these are wonderfully drawn, and follow the spirit of the times, through the cult of sentiment to the revolutionary and [[nationalist]] fervour of the start of the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;Mayor, 568, 591–600.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Goya War2.jpg|thumb|One of ''[[Los desastres de la guerra]]'', [[aquatint]] by [[Goya]]]]
[[Goya]]'s superb but violent [[aquatint]]s often look as though they are illustrating some unwritten work of fiction, but their meaning must be elucidated from their titles, often containing several meanings, and the brief comments recorded by him about many of them. His prints show from early on the macabre world that appears only in hints in the paintings until the last years.  They were nearly all published in several series, of which the most famous are: ''Caprichos'' (1799), ''[[Los desastres de la guerra]]'' (''The Disasters of War'' from after 1810, but unpublished for fifty years after). Rather too many further editions were published after his death, when his delicate aquatint tone had been worn down, or reworked.&lt;ref&gt;Bareau. Mayor, 624–631.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[William Blake]] was as technically unconventional as he was in subject-matter and everything else, pioneering a relief etching process that was later to become the dominant technique of commercial illustration for a time. Many of his prints are pages for his books, with text and image on the same plate, as in the 15th century block-books.&lt;ref&gt;Mayor, 608–611. Spangeberg, 262.&lt;/ref&gt; The Romantic Movement saw a revival in original printmaking in several countries, with Germany taking a large part once again; many of the [[Nazarene movement]] were printmakers.&lt;ref&gt;Griffiths and Carey.&lt;/ref&gt; In England, [[John Sell Cotman]] etched many landscapes and buildings in an effective, straightforward style. [[J. M. W. Turner]] produced several print series including one, the ''[[Liber Studiorum]]'', which consisted of seventy-one etchings with mezzotint that were influential on landscape artists; according to Linda Hults, this series of prints amounts to "Turner's manual of landscape types, and&amp;nbsp;... a statement of his philosophy of landscape."&lt;ref&gt;Hults, 522.&lt;/ref&gt; With the relatively few etchings of [[Eugène Delacroix|Delacroix]] the period of the old master print can be said to come to an end.&lt;ref&gt;Spangeberg, 260–261&lt;/ref&gt; Printmaking was to revive powerfully later in the 19th and 20th centuries, in a great variety of techniques.&lt;ref&gt;Mayor, 660 onwards. Spangeberg, 263 onwards.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{about|the musical term||Perpetual motion (disambiguation)}}{{See also|Round (music)|Canon (music)}}{{refimprove|date=October 2016}}
In music, '''''perpetuum mobile''''' ([[Latin]] and English pronunciation /pəːˌpɛtjʊəm ˈməʊbɪleɪ, ˈməʊbɪli; literally, "perpetual motion"), '''''moto perpetuo''''' ([[Italian language|Italian]]), '''''mouvement perpétuel''''' ([[French language|French]]), '''''movimento perpétuo''''' ([[Portuguese Language|Portuguese]]) '''''movimiento perpetuo''''' ([[Spanish language|Spanish]]), carries two distinct meanings: first, as pieces or parts of pieces of [[music]] characterised by a continuous stream of notes, usually at a rapid [[tempo]]; and also as whole pieces, or large parts of pieces, which are to be played in a repititious fashion, often an indefinite number of times.

==Types of ''perpetuum mobile'' composition==
[[File:Chopin sonata2 finale.svg|thumb|550px|A well-known example as a technique is the ''presto'' finale of [[Frédéric Chopin]]'s ''[[Piano Sonata No. 2 (Chopin)|Piano Sonata No. 2]]:'' This figuration of rapid triplet quavers (eighth notes) continues for the duration of the movement.]]
{{Listen|type=music|filename=David Popper - Elfentanz (Hans Goldstein, cello).ogg|title="Elfentanz"|description=A ''perpetuum mobile'' for cello and piano by [[David Popper]], consisting of continuous ''spiccato''. Hans Goldstein ({{H:title|Yep, a cello|cello}}) and Mellicia Straaf (piano).}}
As a distinct composition, ''perpetuum mobile'' can be defined as one in which part or most of the piece is intended to be repeated an often unspecified number of times, without the "motion" of the melody being halted when a repeat begins.

[[Canon (music)|Canon]] are often intended to be performed in a ''moto perpetuo'' fashion, and can thus be called ''canon perpetuus''.

In some cases the repeats of a "perpetuum mobile" piece are at a different pitch, while a [[Modulation (music)|modulation]] or a [[chord progression]] occurs during the repeatable part. Some of the ''riddle canons'' of [[Johann Sebastian Bach|Bach]]'s {{lang|de|[[The Musical Offering|Das Musikalische Opfer]]}} are examples of this particular kind of ''perpetuum mobile''/''canon perpetuus''.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}

''Perpetuum mobile'' as a [[Music genre|genre]] of separate musical compositions was at the height of its popularity by the end of the 19th century. Such pieces would often be performed as virtuoso [[encore (concert)|encore]]s, in some cases increasing the tempo along the repeats.

==Examples==
''Perpetuum mobile'' pieces of both kinds include:

===Classical period===
* The finale of [[Haydn]]'s String Quartet No. 53 in D major ("The Lark"), Op. 64, No. 5

[[File:Jimi Hendrix Experience.png|alt=|thumb|The [[Jimi Hendrix Experience]]]]
A '''power trio''' is a [[rock and roll]] band format having a lineup of [[electric guitar]], [[bass guitar]] and [[drum kit]] (drums and cymbals), leaving out the second [[rhythm guitar]] or [[Musical keyboard|keyboard]] instrument (e.g., [[Hammond organ]]) that are used in other rock music bands that are quartets and quintets. Larger rock bands use one or more additional [[rhythm section]] to fill out the sound with chords and harmony parts. 

Most power trios in [[hard rock]] and [[heavy metal music]] use the [[electric guitar]] player in two roles; during much of the song, they play [[rhythm guitar]], playing the [[chord progression]] for the song and performing the song's important [[ostinato|riff]]s, and then switching to a [[lead guitar]] role during the [[guitar solo]]. While one or more band members typically sing while they play their instruments, power trios in [[hard rock]] and [[heavy metal music]] generally emphasize instrumental performance and overall sonic impact over vocals and lyrics.&lt;ref name=HistoryOfRockAndRoll&gt;{{cite book|last=Larson|first=Tom|title=History of Rock and Roll|year=2004|publisher=Kendall/Hunt|isbn=978-0787299699|page=183}}&lt;/ref&gt; An example of a power trio is [[Motörhead]], which consisted of a bassist, guitarist and drummer, with [[Lemmy]], the bass guitarist, singing lead vocals simultaneously while he played bass.

==History==
The rise of the power trio in the 1960s was made possible in part by developments in [[amplifier]] technology that greatly enhanced the volume of the electric guitar and bass. Particularly, the popularization of the electric bass guitar defined the bottom end and filled in the gaps. Since the amplified bass could also now be louder, the rest of the band could also play at higher volumes, without fear of being unable to hear the bass. This allowed a three-person band to have the same sonic impact as a large band but left far more room for improvisation and creativity, unencumbered by the need for detailed arrangements. As with the [[organ trio]], a 1960s-era [[soul jazz]] group centered on the amplified [[Hammond organ]], a three-piece group could fill a large bar or club with a big sound for a much lower price than a large rock and roll band. A power trio, at least in its [[blues rock]] incarnation, is also generally held to have developed out of [[Chicago blues|Chicago-style blues]] bands such as [[Muddy Waters]]' trio.

[[File:Cream Clapton Bruce Baker 1960s.jpg|thumb|left|[[Cream (band)|Cream]]]]
In addition to technological improvements, another impetus for the rise of the power trio was the virtuosity of guitarists such as [[Eric Clapton]], [[Jimi Hendrix]], and [[Rory Gallagher]], who could essentially cover both the [[rhythm guitar]] and [[lead guitar]] roles in a live performance. In 1964, [[Frank Zappa]] played guitar in a power trio the Muthers, with Paul Woods on bass and Les Papp on drums.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Frank Zappa: The Negative Dialectics of Poodle Play |first1=Ben |last1=Watson |publisher=Quarted Books |year=1994 |isbn=0-7043-7066-2 |page=26 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=y9T7GwAACAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1966, the prototypical blues-rock power trio [[Cream (band)|Cream]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Encyclopedia of Recorded Sound |first1=Frank |last1=Hoffmann |publisher=Routledge |year=2004 |isbn=978-1-135-94950-1 |page=505 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-FOSAgAAQBAJ}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=-FOSAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA505 Extract of page 505]&lt;/ref&gt; was formed, consisting of [[Eric Clapton]] on guitar/vocals, [[Jack Bruce]] on bass/vocals, and [[Ginger Baker]] on drums.

[[File:Prester John.jpg|thumb|250px|"''Preste''" as the [[Emperor of Ethiopia]], enthroned on a map of East Africa in an atlas prepared by the Portuguese for [[Mary I of England|Queen Mary]], 1558. ([[British Library]])]]
'''Prester John''' ({{lang-la|Presbyter Johannes}}) was a legendary Christian patriarch, [[presbyter]] ([[Elder (Christianity)|elder]]) and king who was popular in European chronicles and tradition from the 12th through the 17th centuries. He was said to rule over a [[Nestorianism|Nestorian]] ([[Church of the East]]) Christian nation lost amid the Muslims and pagans of the [[Orient]], in which the Patriarch of the [[Saint Thomas Christians]] resided. The accounts are varied collections of medieval popular fantasy, depicting Prester John as a descendant of the [[Three Magi]], ruling a kingdom full of riches, marvels, and strange creatures.

At first, Prester John was imagined to reside in [[Indian subcontinent|India]]; tales of the Nestorian Christians' evangelistic success there and of [[Thomas the Apostle]]'s subcontinental travels as documented in works like the ''[[Acts of Thomas]]'' probably provided the first seeds of the legend. After the coming of the [[Mongols]] to the Western world, accounts placed the king in [[Central Asia]], and eventually Portuguese explorers convinced themselves that they had found him in [[Horn of Africa|Ethiopia]].

== Origin of the legend ==
Though its immediate genesis is unclear, the legend of Prester John drew strongly from earlier accounts of the Orient and of Westerners' travels there. Particularly influential were the stories of Saint Thomas the Apostle's proselytizing in India, recorded especially in the 3rd-century work known as the ''Acts of Thomas''. This text inculcated in Westerners an image of "India" as a place of exotic wonders and offered the earliest description of Saint Thomas establishing a Christian sect there, motifs that loomed large over later accounts of Prester John.&lt;ref&gt;Silverberg, pp. 17–18.&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, distorted reports of the [[Church of the East]]'s movements in Asia informed the legend as well. This church, also called the Nestorian church and centered in [[Persia]], had gained a wide following in the Eastern nations and engaged the Western imagination as an assemblage both exotic and familiarly Christian.&lt;ref&gt;Silverberg, p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt; Particularly inspiring were the Nestorians' missionary successes among the [[Mongols]] and [[Turkic peoples|Turks]] of Central Asia; French historian [[René Grousset]] suggests that one of the origins of the story may have come from the [[Kerait]] clan, which had thousands of its members converted to Nestorian Christianity shortly after the year 1000. By the 12th century, the Kerait rulers were still following a custom of bearing Christian names, which may have fueled the legend.&lt;ref&gt;Grousset, p. 191&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:PriesterJohannes.jpg|thumb|250px|Prester John from [[Hartmann Schedel]]'s ''[[Nuremberg Chronicle]]'', 1493]]

Additionally, the tradition may have drawn from the shadowy early Christian figure [[John the Presbyter]] of [[Syria]], whose existence is first inferred by the ecclesiastical historian and bishop [[Eusebius of Caesarea]] based on his reading of earlier church fathers.&lt;ref&gt;Eusebius of Caesarea. ''[[Church History (Eusebius)|Historia Ecclesiastica]]'', III, xxxix, 4.&lt;/ref&gt; This man, said in one document to be the author of two of the [[Epistles of John]],&lt;ref&gt;According to the 5th-century ''[[Decretum Gelasianum]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; was supposed to have been the teacher of the martyr bishop [[Papias of Hierapolis|Papias]], who had in turn taught Eusebius' own teacher [[Irenaeus]]. However, little links this figure, supposedly active in the late 1st century, to the Prester John legend beyond the name.&lt;ref&gt;Silverberg, pp. 35–39.&lt;/ref&gt; The title "Prester" is an adaptation of the Late Latin word "[[presbyter]]", literally meaning "elder" and used as a title of [[priest]]s holding a high office (indeed, ''presbyter'' is the origin of the English word ''priest'').&lt;ref&gt;{{OEtymD|Prester John}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://geography.about.com/od/historyofgeography/a/presterjohn.htm|title=Prester John|last=Rosenberg|first=Matt|date=2016|website=geography.about.com|publisher=about|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The later accounts of Prester John borrowed heavily from literary texts concerning the East, including the great body of ancient and medieval geographical and travel literature. Details were often lifted from literary and pseudohistorical accounts, such as the tale of [[Sinbad the Sailor]].&lt;ref&gt;Silverberg, pp. 16, 49–50.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Alexander romance]], a fabulous account of [[Alexander the Great]]'s conquests, was especially influential in this regard.&lt;ref&gt;Silverberg, pp. 46–48.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Prester John legend as such began in the early 12th century with reports of visits of an [[Archbishop]] of India to [[Constantinople]], and of a Patriarch of India to Rome at the time of [[Pope Callixtus II]].&lt;ref&gt;Silverberg, pp. 29–34.&lt;/ref&gt; These visits, apparently from the Saint Thomas Christians of India, cannot be confirmed, evidence of both being secondhand reports. What is certain is that German chronicler [[Otto of Freising]] reported in his ''Chronicon'' of 1145 that the previous year he had met [[Hugh of Jabala|Hugh]], bishop of [[Jabala]] in Syria, at the court of [[Pope Eugene III]] in [[Viterbo]].&lt;ref name=halsall&gt;Halsall, Paul (1997). [http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/source/otto-prester.html "Otto of Freising: The Legend of Prester John"]. Internet Medieval Sourcebook. Retrieved June 20, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Silverberg, pp. 3–7&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bowden, p. 177&lt;/ref&gt; Hugh was an emissary of Prince [[Raymond of Antioch|Raymond]] of [[Principality of Antioch|Antioch]], sent to seek Western aid against the Saracens after the [[Siege of Edessa]]; his counsel incited Eugene to call for the [[Second Crusade]]. Hugh told Otto, in the presence of the pope, that Prester John, a Nestorian Christian who served in the dual position of priest and king, had regained the city of [[Ecbatana]] from the brother monarchs of [[Medes]] and Persia, the Samiardi, in a great battle "not many years ago". Afterwards Prester John allegedly set out for [[Jerusalem]] to rescue the Holy Land, but the swollen waters of the [[Tigris]] compelled him to return to his own country. His fabulous wealth was demonstrated by his emerald scepter; his holiness by his descent from the [[Biblical Magi|Three Magi]].&lt;ref&gt;Fertur enim iste de antiqua progenie illorum, quorum in Evangelio mentio fit, esse Magorum, eisdemque, quibus et isti, gentibus imperans, tanta gloria et habundancia frui, ut non nisi sceptro smaragdino uti dicatur (It is reported that he is the descendant of those Magi of old who are mentioned in the Gospel, and to rule over the same nations as they did, enjoying such glory and prosperity that he uses no sceptre but one of emerald). Otto von Freising, ''Historia de Duabus Civitatibus,'' 1146, in Friedrich Zarncke, ''Der Priester Johannes,'' Leipzig, Hirzel, 1879 (repr. Georg Olms Verlag, Hildesheim and New York, 1980, p.848; [https://archive.org/details/ottonisepiscopif45otto Adolf Hofmeister, ''Ottonis Episcopi Frisingensis Chronica; sive, Historia de Duabus Civitatibus,'' Hannover. 1912, p.366.]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Robert Silverberg]] connects this account with historical events of 1141, when the [[Kara-Khitan Khanate]] under [[Yelü Dashi]] defeated the [[Seljuk Turks]] near [[Samarkand]]. The Seljuks ruled over Persia at the time and were the most powerful force in the Muslim world, and the defeat at Samarkand weakened them substantially. While the Kara-Khitan at the time were [[Buddhists]] and not Christian, and there is no reason to suppose Yelü Dashi was ever called Prester John.&lt;ref name="rossabi-5" /&gt; However, several vassals of the Kara-Khitan practiced Nestorian Christianity, which may have contributed to the legend, as well as the possibility that the Europeans, who were unfamiliar with Buddhism, assumed that if the leader was not Muslim, he must be Christian.&lt;ref&gt;Silverberg, pp. 12–13.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jackson, pp. 20–21&lt;/ref&gt; The defeat encouraged the Crusaders and inspired a notion of deliverance from the East, and it is possible Otto recorded Hugh's confused report to prevent complacency in the Crusade's European backers; according to his account, no help could be expected from a powerful Eastern king.&lt;ref&gt;Silverberg, p. 8&lt;/ref&gt;

== Letter of Prester John ==
No more of the tale is recorded until about 1165 when copies of what was likely a forged ''Letter of Prester John'' started spreading throughout Europe.&lt;ref name="rossabi-5"&gt;Rossabi, p. 5&lt;/ref&gt; An epistolary wonder tale with parallels suggesting its author knew the ''[[Alexander romance|Romance of Alexander]]'' and the above-mentioned ''Acts of Thomas'', the ''Letter'' was supposedly written to the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine Emperor]] [[Manuel I Comnenus]] by Prester John, descendant of one of the Three Magi and King of India.&lt;ref&gt;Silverberg, pp. 40–73.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Michael Uebel]], ''Ecstatic Transformation: On the Uses of Alterity in the Middle Ages'', Palgrave/Macmillan (2005), contains a full English translation and a discussion of the ''Letter''.&lt;/ref&gt; The many marvels of richness and magic it contained captured the imagination of Europeans, and it was translated into numerous languages, including [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]]. It circulated in ever more embellished form for centuries in manuscripts, examples of which still exist. The invention of [[printing]] perpetuated the letter's popularity in printed form; it was still current in popular culture during the period of [[Age of Discovery|European exploration]]. Part of the letter's essence was that a lost kingdom of Nestorian Christians still existed in the vastnesses of Central Asia.

The credence given to the reports was such that [[Pope Alexander III]] sent a letter to Prester John via his physician Philip on September 27, 1177. Nothing more is recorded of Philip, but it is most probable that he did not return with word from Prester John.&lt;ref&gt;Silverberg, pp. 58–60&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Letter'' continued to circulate, accruing more embellishments with each copy. In modern times, [[Content analysis|textual analysis]] of the letter's variant Hebrew versions has suggested an origin among the [[Jew]]s of northern Italy or [[Languedoc]]: several Italian words remained in the Hebrew texts.&lt;ref&gt;Bar-Ilan, Meir (1995). [http://faculty.biu.ac.il/~barilm/presjohn.html "Prester John: Fiction and History"]. In ''History of European Ideas'', vol. 20 (1–3), pp. 291–298. Retrieved June 20, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; At any rate, the ''Letter''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s author was most likely a Westerner.

== Mongol Empire ==
[[File:WangKhan.JPG|thumb|right|250px|Depiction of the [[Keraite]] ruler [[Toghrul]] as "Prester John" in "Le Livre des Merveilles", 15th century]]

In 1221, [[Jacques de Vitry]], [[Latin Catholic Diocese of Acre|Bishop of Acre]], returned from the disastrous [[Fifth Crusade]] with good news: King David of India, the son or grandson of Prester John, had mobilized his armies against the Saracens. He had already conquered Persia, then under the [[Khwarezmian Empire]]'s control, and was moving on towards [[Baghdad]] as well. This descendant of the great king who had defeated the Seljuks in 1141 planned to reconquer and rebuild Jerusalem.&lt;ref&gt;Jacques de Vitry; Huygens, R. B. C. (Ed.) (1970). ''Lettres de Jacques de Vitry''. Leiden.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Silverberg, pp. 71–73.&lt;/ref&gt; Controversial Soviet historian and ethnologist [[Lev Gumilev]] speculated that the much reduced [[Crusades|crusader]] [[Kingdom of Jerusalem]] in the [[Levant]] resuscitated this legend in order to raise Christian hopes and to persuade European monarchs who had lost interest by that time in getting involved in costly crusades in a distant region that was far removed from their own states and affairs.&lt;ref&gt;Lev Gumilev – Searching for an Imaginary Kingdom : The Legend of the Kingdom of Prester John (1970), p.342&lt;/ref&gt;

The bishop of Acre was correct in thinking that a great king had conquered Persia; however "King David", as it turned out, was the [[Tengrist]] Mongol ruler, [[Genghis Khan]]. His reign took the story of Prester John in a new direction. Though Genghis Khan was at first seen as a scourge of Christianity's ''enemies'', he proved to be tolerant of religious faiths among those subjects that did not resist the empire and was the first East Asian ruler to invite clerics from three major religions (Christianity, Islam, and Buddhism) to a [[symposium]] so that he might learn more about their beliefs.&lt;ref name="chua"&gt;{{cite book|title=Day of Empire: How Hyperpowers Rise to Global Dominance |last=Chua |first=Amy |authorlink=Amy Chua |publisher=Doubleday |year=2007 |isbn=978-0-385-51284-8 |series=Chapter on the surprising religious tolerance of the Mongol Court, as Chua describes it; to which she attributes the administrative success of the Khan's descendants. Chua describes the unique debate between 13th-century Buddhist, Christian and Muslim clerics as having been ultimately resolved over copious quantities of drink, with the Great Khan undecided, according to accounts by the first Christian visitors to the Mongol court}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Mongol ruler was also reputed to have a Nestorian Christian favorite among his many wives, whom the Europeans imagined as influential in the disastrous Mongol sack of Baghdad.&lt;ref name="chua" /&gt;

The [[Mongol Empire]]'s rise gave Western Christians the opportunity to visit lands that they had never seen before, and they set out in large numbers along the empire's secure roads. Belief that a lost Nestorian kingdom existed in the east, or that the [[Crusader states]]' salvation depended on an [[Franco-Mongol alliance|alliance with an Eastern monarch]], was one reason for the numerous Christian ambassadors and missionaries sent to the Mongols. These include [[Franciscan]] explorers [[Giovanni da Pian del Carpine]] in 1245 and [[William of Rubruck]] in 1253.&lt;ref&gt;Silverberg, p. 86.&lt;/ref&gt;

The link between Prester John and Genghis Khan was elaborated upon at this time, as the Prester became identified with Genghis' foster father, [[Toghrul]], king of the [[Keraites]], given the [[Jin dynasty (1115–1234)|Jin]] title Ong Khan Toghrul. Fairly truthful chroniclers and explorers such as [[Marco Polo]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Marco Polo|Polo, Marco]]; Latham, Ronald (translator) (1958). ''[[The Travels of Marco Polo|The Travels]]'', pp. 62–65. New York: Penguin Books. {{ISBN|0-14-044057-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Crusader-historian [[Jean de Joinville]],&lt;ref name="Joinville"&gt;Jean de Joinville; [[Geoffrey of Villehardouin|Geffroy de Villehardouin]]; and Shaw, Margaret R. B. (translator) (1963). ''Chronicles of the Crusades''. New York: Penguin. {{ISBN|0-14-044124-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and the Franciscan voyager [[Odoric of Pordenone]]&lt;ref&gt;Odoric of Pordenone; [[Henry Yule|Yule, Henry]] (translator); Chiesa, Paolo (introduction) (December 15, 2001). ''The Travels of Friar Odoric''. Grand Rapids, Michigan: Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing Company. {{ISBN|0-8028-4963-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; stripped Prester John of much of his otherworldly veneer, portraying him as a more realistic earthly monarch. Odoric places John's land to the west of [[Cathay]] en route to Europe, and mentions its capital as Casan, which may correspond to [[Kazan]], the [[Tatars|Tatar]] capital near Moscow. Joinville describes Genghis Khan in his chronicle as a "wise man" who unites all the Tartar tribes and leads them to victory against their strongest enemy, Prester John.&lt;ref name="Joinville" /&gt; William of Rubruck says a certain "Vut", lord of the Keraites and brother to the Nestorian ''King'' John, was defeated by the Mongols under Genghis Khan. Genghis Khan made off with Vut's daughter and married her to his son, and their union produced [[Möngke Khan|Möngke]], the Khan at the time William wrote.&lt;ref&gt;William of Rubruck; Jackson, Peter; Ruysbroeck, Willem van; Morgan, David (editors) (1990). ''The Mission of Friar William of Rubruck''. London: Hakluyt Society. {{ISBN|0-904180-29-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Marco Polo's ''[[The Travels of Marco Polo|Travels]]'', the war between the Prester and Genghis Khan started when Genghis Khan, new ruler of the rebellious Tartars, asked for the hand of Prester John's daughter in marriage. Angered that his lowly vassal would make such a request, Prester John denied him in no uncertain terms. In the war that followed, Genghis Khan triumphed, and Prester John perished.&lt;ref&gt;[[Marco Polo]], pp. 65.&lt;/ref&gt;

The historical figure behind these accounts, Toghrul, was in fact a Nestorian Christian monarch defeated by Genghis Khan. He had fostered the future Khan after the death of his father [[Yesugei]] and was one of his early allies, but the two had a falling-out. After Toghrul rejected a proposal to wed his son and daughter to Genghis Khan's children, the rift between them grew until war broke out in 1203. Genghis Khan captured [[Sorghaghtani Beki]], daughter of Toghrul's brother Jaqa Gambu, and married her to his son [[Tolui]]; they had several children, including Möngke, [[Kublai Khan|Kublai]], [[Hulagu Khan|Hulagu]], and [[Ariq Böke]].

The major characteristic of Prester John tales from this period is the king's portrayal not as an invincible hero, but merely one of many adversaries defeated by the Mongols. But as the Mongol Empire collapsed, Europeans began to shift away from the idea that Prester John had ever really been a Central Asian king.&lt;ref&gt;Silverberg, p. 139.&lt;/ref&gt; At any rate they had little hope of finding him there, as travel in the region became dangerous without the security the empire had provided. In works such as ''[[John Mandeville|The Travels of Sir John Mandeville]]''&lt;ref&gt;Halsall, Paul (March 1996). [http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/source/mandeville.html "Mandeville on Prester John"]. Internet Medieval Sourcebook. Retrieved June 20, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mosely, C. W. R. D. (1983). ''The Travels of Sir John Mandeville'', pp. 167–171. New York: Penguin Books. {{ISBN|0-14-044435-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Historia Trium Regum'' by [[John of Hildesheim]],&lt;ref&gt;John of Hildesheim (1997). ''The Story of the Three Kings''. Neumann Press. {{ISBN|0-911845-68-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Prester John's domain tends to regain its fantastic aspects and finds itself located not on the steppes of Central Asia, but back in India proper, or some other exotic locale. [[Wolfram von Eschenbach]] tied the history of Prester John to the [[Holy Grail]] legend in his poem ''[[Parzival]]'', in which the Prester is the son of the Grail maiden and the Saracen knight [[Feirefiz]].&lt;ref&gt;Wolfram von Eschenbach; [[Arthur Thomas Hatto|Hatto, A. T.]] (1980). ''Parzival'', p. 408. New York: Penguin. {{ISBN|0-14-044361-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

A theory was put forward by the Russian scholar Ph. Bruun in 1876, who suggested that Prester John might be found among the kings of [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], which, at the time of Crusades, experienced military resurgence challenging the Muslim power. However, this theory, though regarded with certain indulgence by [[Henry Yule]] and some modern Georgian historians, was summarily dismissed by [[Friedrich Karl Theodor Zarncke|Friedrich Zarncke]].&lt;ref&gt;Arthur Percival Newton, E. D. Hunt (1996), ''Travel and travellers of the Middle Ages'', p. 190. [[Routledge]], {{ISBN|0-415-15605-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Prester John map.jpg|thumb|250px|right|A map of Prester John's kingdom as Ethiopia]]

Prester John had been considered the ruler of India since the legend's beginnings, but "India" was a vague concept to the Europeans. Writers often spoke of the "Three Indias", and lacking any real knowledge of the [[Indian Ocean]], they sometimes considered [[Ethiopia]] one of the three. Westerners knew that Ethiopia was a powerful Christian nation, but contact had been sporadic since the rise of Islam. No Prester John was to be found in Asia, so European imagination moved him around the blurry frontiers of "India" until it found an appropriately powerful kingdom for him in Ethiopia.&lt;ref&gt;Silverberg, pp. 163–164.&lt;/ref&gt; Evidence has suggested that locating Prester John's kingdom in Ethiopia entered the collective consciousness around 1250.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=A Cultural History of the Atlantic World, 1250-1820|last=Thornton|first=Joe|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2012|isbn=9780521727341|location=|pages=16–17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Marco Polo]] had discussed Ethiopia as a magnificent Christian land&lt;ref&gt;Marco Polo, pp. 303–307.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox Christians]] had a legend that the nation would one day rise up and invade [[Arabian Peninsula|Arabia]],&lt;ref&gt;Silverberg, pp. 176–177.&lt;/ref&gt; but they did not place Prester John there. Then in 1306, 30 Ethiopian ambassadors from Emperor [[Wedem Arad]] came to Europe, and Prester John was mentioned as the patriarch of their church in a record of their visit.&lt;ref&gt;Silverberg, pp. 164–165.&lt;/ref&gt; Another description of an African Prester John is in the ''Mirabilia Descripta'' of [[Catalans|Catalan]] [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] missionary [[Jordanus Catalani]], around 1329.&lt;ref&gt;Jordanus Catalani, ''Mirabilia'', chapter VI (2).&lt;/ref&gt; In discussing the "Third India", Jordanus records a number of fanciful stories about the land and its king, whom he says Europeans call Prester John.

After this point, an African location became increasingly popular. This may have resulted from increasing ties between Europe and Africa as 1428 saw the Kings of Aragon and Ethiopia actively negotiating the possibility of a strategic marriage between the two kingdoms.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; On 7 May 1487, two Portuguese envoys, [[Pêro da Covilhã]] and [[Afonso de Paiva]], were sent traveling secretly overland to gather information on a possible sea route to India, but also to inquire about Prester John. Covilhã managed to reach Ethiopia. Although well received, he was forbidden to depart. More envoys were sent in 1507, after [[Socotra]] was taken by the Portuguese. As a result of this mission, and facing Muslim expansion, regent queen [[Eleni of Ethiopia]] sent ambassador [[Mateus (Ethiopia)|Mateus]] to king [[Manuel I of Portugal]] and to the pope, in search of a coalition. Mateus reached Portugal via [[Goa]], having returned with a Portuguese embassy, along with priest [[Francisco Álvares]] in 1520. Francisco Álvares' book, which included the testimony of Covilhã, the ''Verdadeira Informação das Terras do Preste João das Indias'' ("A True Relation of the Lands of Prester John of the Indies") was the first direct account of Ethiopia, greatly increasing European knowledge at the time, as it was presented to the pope, published and quoted by [[Giovanni Battista Ramusio]].&lt;ref&gt;Cecil H. Clough, David B. Quinn, Paul Edward Hedley Hair, [https://books.google.com/books?id=Dg-8ZOeBqcYC&amp;lpg=PA85&amp;dq=Jo%C3%A3o%20Gomes%20socotra%20Albuquerque&amp;as_brr=3&amp;pg=PA85#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false "The European outthrust and encounter: the first phase c.1400-c.1700", p.85-86], Liverpool University Press, 1994, {{ISBN|0-85323-229-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the time Emperor [[Dawit II of Ethiopia|Lebna Dengel]] and the Portuguese had established diplomatic contact with each other in 1520, Prester John was the name by which Europeans knew the [[Emperor of Ethiopia]].&lt;ref name="emperor"&gt;Silverberg, pp. 188–189.&lt;/ref&gt; The Ethiopians, though, had never called their emperor that. When ambassadors from Emperor [[Zara Yaqob]] attended the [[Council of Florence]] in 1441, they were confused when council prelates insisted on referring to their monarch as Prester John. They tried to explain that nowhere in Zara Yaqob's list of regnal names did that title occur. However, their admonitions did little to stop Europeans from calling the King of Ethiopia Prester John.&lt;ref&gt;Silverberg, p. 189.&lt;/ref&gt; Some writers who used the title did understand it was not an indigenous honorific; for instance Jordanus seems to use it simply because his readers would have been familiar with it, not because he thought it authentic.&lt;ref&gt;Silverberg, p. 166–167.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ethiopia has been claimed for many years as the origin of the Prester John legend, but most modern experts believe that the legend was simply adapted to fit that nation in the same fashion that it had been projected upon Ong Khan and Central Asia during the 13th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Salvadore|first=Matteo|title=The African Prester John and the Birth of Ethiopian-European Relations  (Introduction)|url=https://www.academia.edu/25983362/The_African_Prester_John_and_the_Birth_of_Ethiopian-European_Relations_Introduction_|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Modern scholars find nothing about Prester John or his country in the early material that would make Ethiopia a more suitable identification than any place else, and furthermore, specialists in Ethiopian history have effectively demonstrated that the story was not widely known there until well after European contact. [[Czech people|Czech]] Franciscan Remedius Prutky asked Emperor [[Iyasu II of Ethiopia|Iyasu II]] about this identification in 1751, and Prutky states that the man was "astonished, and told me that the kings of Abyssinia had never been accustomed to call themselves by this name."&lt;ref&gt;Arrowsmith-Brown, p. 115.&lt;/ref&gt; In a footnote to this passage, [[Richard Pankhurst (academic)|Richard Pankhurst]] states that this is apparently the first recorded statement by an Ethiopian monarch about this tale, and they were likely unaware of the title until Prutky's inquiry.&lt;ref&gt;Arrowsmith-Brown, p. 115 n 24.&lt;/ref&gt;

== End of the legend and cultural legacy ==
17th-century academics like German [[Orientalism|orientalist]] [[Hiob Ludolf]] demonstrated that there was no actual native connection between Prester John and the Ethiopian monarchs,&lt;ref&gt;Ludolf, Hiob (1681). ''Historia Aethiopica''.&lt;/ref&gt; and search for the fabled king gradually ceased. But the legend had affected several hundred years of European and world history, directly and indirectly, by encouraging Europe's explorers, missionaries, scholars, and treasure hunters.

The prospect of finding Prester John had long since vanished, but the tales continued to inspire through the 20th century. [[William Shakespeare]]'s 1600 play ''[[Much Ado About Nothing]]'' contains an early modern reference to the legendary king,&lt;ref&gt;Shakespeare, William (1600). ''Much Ado About Nothing'', act II, scene 1, line 225. '...bring you the length of Prester John’s foot...'&lt;/ref&gt; as does [[Tirso de Molina]]'s ''[[El Burlador de Sevilla]]''.&lt;ref&gt;de Molina, Tirso (1630). ''El Burlador de Sevilla y convidado de piedra'', jornada II.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1910 Scottish novelist and politician [[John Buchan]] used the legend in his sixth book, ''[[Prester John (novel)|Prester John]]'', to supplement a plot about a [[Zulu people|Zulu]] uprising in South Africa. This book is an archetypal example of the early 20th-century [[adventure novel]], and proved very popular in its day.  

Perhaps because of Buchan's work, Prester John appeared in [[pulp magazine|pulp fiction]] and [[comics]] throughout the century. For example, [[Marvel Comics]] has featured "[[Prester John (comics)|Prester John]]" in issues of ''[[Fantastic Four]]'' and ''[[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]]''. He was a significant supporting character in several issues of the [[DC Comics]] fantasy series ''[[Arak (comics)|Arak: Son of Thunder]]''. [[Charles Williams (UK writer)|Charles Williams]], a member of the 20th-century literary group the [[Inklings]], made Prester John a messianic protector of the Holy Grail in his 1930 novel ''War in Heaven''. 

Prester John and his kingdom also figure prominently in [[Umberto Eco]]'s 2000 novel ''[[Baudolino]]'', in which the titular protagonist enlists his friends to write the ''Letter of Prester John'' for his adoptive father [[Frederick Barbarossa]], but it is stolen before they can send it out.

==Heraldry==
Various [[attributed arms]] have been given to Prester John. ''Azure, the Saviour on the Cross or'' is given by [[Thomas Willement]] in ''Heraldic Notices of Canterbury Cathedral'', 1827.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Willement, ''Heraldic Notices of Canterbury Cathedral'', 1827, p.140, number 732, note [https://books.google.com/books?id=I4NPAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA140&amp;lpg=PA140&amp;dq=prester+john+lion+rampant&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=mU5sJreSOH&amp;sig=1GPMliY-6OT9J6efeQZBQoKsmZE&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiS8Nf5vZ7QAhXnCcAKHTOmBEwQ6AEIMjAF#v=onepage&amp;q=prester%20john%20lion%20rampant&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt; They are shown as ''A lion rampant facing to the sinister holding in its paws a quasi-Tau cross of full height'' on a 16th century map of Africa by [[Abraham Ortelius]].&lt;ref&gt;16th c. map of Africa by Abraham Ortelius (1527-1598), ''Presbiteri Johannis, sive, Abissinorum Imperii descriptio'' ("A Description of the Empire of Prester John, that is to say, of the Abysinians").

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15545">'''Proto-Bantu''' is the reconstructed common ancestor of the [[Bantu languages]], a subgroup of the [[Benue-Congo]] family.&lt;ref&gt;Erhet &amp; Posnansky, eds. (1982), Newman (1995)&lt;/ref&gt; It is thought to have originally been spoken in West/Central [[Africa]] in the area of what is now [[Cameroon]].&lt;ref name=Dim&gt;Dimmendaal, Gerrit J. (2011). ''Historical Linguistics and the Comparative Study of African Languages'', pp. 337ff.&lt;/ref&gt; 
Approximately 3000–4000 years ago, it split off from other [[Southern Bantoid|Bantoid languages]] when the [[Bantu expansion]] began to the south and east.&lt;ref&gt;Newman (1995), Shillington (2005)&lt;/ref&gt; Two theories have been put forward about the way the languages expanded: one is that the Bantu-speaking people moved first to the Congo region and then a branch split off and moved to East Africa; the other (more likely) is that the two groups split from the beginning, one moving to the Congo region, and the other to East Africa.&lt;ref name=Dim /&gt;

Like other [[proto-language]]s, there is no record of Proto-Bantu. Its words and pronunciation have been [[linguistic reconstruction|reconstructed]] by linguists. From the common vocabulary which has been reconstructed on the basis of present-day Bantu languages, it appears that agriculture, fishing, and the use of boats were already known to the Bantu people before their expansion began, but iron-working was still unknown. This places the date of the start of the expansion somewhere between 3000 BC and 800 BC.&lt;ref&gt;Vansina (1995) quoted by Schadeberg, T. C. in Nurse, D. &amp; Philippson, G. (eds) (2006) ''The Bantu Languages'', p. 160.&lt;/ref&gt;

Doubts continue to be raised as to whether Proto-Bantu, as a unified language, actually existed in the time before the Bantu expansion, or whether, if we were to go back in time to that period we would find not a single language but a group of related dialects. One scholar, [[Roger Blench]], writes: "The argument from comparative linguistics which links the highly diverse languages of zone A to a genuine reconstruction is non-existent. Most claimed Proto-Bantu is either confined to particular subgroups, or is widely attested outside Bantu proper."&lt;ref&gt;Blench, Roger [http://www.rogerblench.info/Language/Niger-Congo/General/Niger-Congo%20an%20alternative%20view.pdf]. Paper circulated before the Niger-Congo conference of September 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; According to this view, Bantu is a [[Polyphyly|polyphyletic]] group that combines a number of smaller language families which ultimately belong to the (much larger) [[Southern Bantoid languages|Southern Bantoid]] [[language family]].

==Phonology==
Proto-Bantu is generally reconstructed to have a relatively small set of sounds of 11 consonants and 7 vowels.&lt;ref name="Hyman"&gt;Hyman, Larry (2003). In Nurse, D. &amp; Philippson, G. (eds) ''The Bantu Languages''. pp. 42ff. [http://linguistics.berkeley.edu/~hyman/Bantu_segmental.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Consonants===
{| class="wikitable" style="text-align: center"
|-
!
! [[Labial consonant|Labial]]
! [[Coronal consonant|Coronal]]
! [[Palatal consonant|Palatal]]
! [[Velar consonant|Velar]]
|-
! [[Nasal stop|Nasal]]
| *m

! [[Voice (phonetics)|Voiceless]]
| *p
| *t
| *c
| *k
|-
! [[Voice (phonetics)|Voiced]]
| *b
| *d
| *j
| *g
|}
The above [[phoneme]]s exhibited considerable [[allophony]], and the exact realisation of many of them is unclear.

* Voiceless consonants *p, *t, *k were almost certainly articulated as simple [[plosive consonant|plosives]] {{IPA|[p]}}, {{IPA|[t]}}, {{IPA|[k]}}.
* Voiced consonants *b and *g may also have been [[fricative consonant|fricatives]] {{IPA|[β]}} (or {{IPA|[v]}}) and {{IPA|[ɣ]}} in some environments.
* *d was a plosive {{IPA|[d]}} before a high vowel (*i, *u) and a [[lateral consonant|lateral]] {{IPA|[l]}} before other vowels.&lt;ref name="nurse-philippson"/&gt;
* *c and *j may have been plosives {{IPA|[c]}} and {{IPA|[ɟ]}}, [[affricate consonant|affricates]] {{IPA|[tʃ]}} and {{IPA|[dʒ]}} or even [[sibilant consonant|sibilants]] {{IPA|[s]}} and {{IPA|[z]}}. {{IPA|[j]}} is also possible for *j.

Consonants could not occur at the end of a syllable, only at its beginning. Thus, the syllable structure was generally V or CV, and there were only [[open syllable]]s.&lt;ref name="Hyman"/&gt;

Consonant clusters did not occur except for the "pre-nasalised" consonants.

The so-called "pre-nasalised" consonants were sequences of a nasal and a following obstruent.&lt;ref name="nurse-philippson"/&gt; They could occur anywhere a single consonant was permitted, including word-initially. Pre-nasalised voiceless consonants were rare, as most were voiced. The nasal's articulation adapted to the articulation of the following consonant so the nasal can be considered a single unspecified nasal phoneme (indicated as ''*N'') which had four possible allophones. Conventionally, the labial pre-nasal is written *m while the others are written *n.
* *mb, *mp; phonemically *Nb, *Np
* *nd, *nt; phonemically *Nd, *Nt
* *nj, *nc; phonemically *Nj, *Nc (actually pronounced as *ɲj, *ɲc)
* *ng, *nk; phonemically *Ng, *Nk (actually pronounced as *ŋg, *ŋk)

The earlier velar nasal phoneme {{IPA|/ŋ/}}, which was present in the [[Bantoid languages]], had been lost in Proto-Bantu.&lt;ref name="nurse-philippson"&gt;Derek Nurse, Gérard Philippson (eds) (2006) ''The Bantu Languages''.&lt;/ref&gt; It still occurred phonetically in pre-nasalised consonants but not as a phoneme.

===Vowels===
{| class="wikitable" style="text-align:center"
|-
!
! [[Front vowel|Front]]
! [[Back vowel|Back]]
|-
! [[Close vowel|Close]]
| *i
| *u
|-
! [[Near-close vowel|Near-close]]
| *ɪ
| *ʊ
|-
! [[Open-mid vowel|Open-mid]]
| *e
| *o
|-
! [[Open vowel|Open]]
| colspan="2" | *a
|}

The representation of the vowels may differ in particular with respect to the two "middle" levels of closedness. Some prefer to denote the near-close set as *e and *o, with the more open set represented as *ɛ and *ɔ.

Syllables always ended in a vowel but could also begin with one. Vowels could also occasionally appear in a sequence but did not form [[diphthong]]s; two adjacent vowels were separate syllables. If two of the same vowel occurred together, that created a long vowel, but that was rare.

===Tones===
Proto-Bantu distinguished two [[tone (linguistics)|tones]], low and high. Each syllable had either a low or a high tone. A high tone is conventionally indicated with an acute accent (´), and a low tone is either indicated with a grave accent (`) or not marked at all.

==Morphology==
===Noun classes===
Proto-Bantu, like its descendants, had an elaborate system of [[noun class]]es. Noun stems were prefixed with a noun prefix to specify their meaning. Other words that related or referred to that noun, such as adjectives and verbs, also received a prefix that matched the class of the noun ("[[agreement (linguistics)|agreement]]" or "concord").

Maho offers a broad characterization of five types of Bantu concordial systems.&lt;ref name=Maho&gt;Maho, J. F. (1999). ''A comparative study of Bantu noun classes''.&lt;/ref&gt; Languages descended from Proto-Bantu can be classified into each of the five types.
* '''Type A''': Traditional, strictly formal
* '''Type B''': Traditional with general animate concords
* '''Type C''': Animacy-based SG/PL-marking
* '''Type D''': SG/PL-marking only
* '''Type E''': No concords at all

The following table gives a reconstruction of the system of nominal classes. Spellings have been normalised to use the ''ɪ'' and ''ʊ'' notations. Guthrie's original work uses ''y'' to describe the palatal semi-vowel, which has been normalised to use the ''j'' notation.&lt;ref name=Maho&gt;Maho, J. F. (1999). ''A comparative study of Bantu noun classes''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Guthrie&gt;Guthrie, M. (1970). ''Collected Papers on Bantu Linguistics''.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Wilhelm Bleek]]’s reconstruction consisted of sixteen noun prefixes. [[Carl Meinhof]] adapted Bleek’s prefixes, changing some phonological features and adding more prefixes, bringing the total number to 21. [[A. E. Meeussen]] reduced Meinhof’s reconstructed prefixes to 19, but added an additional locative prefix numbered 23. [[Malcolm Guthrie]] later reconstructed the same 19 classes as Meeussen, but removed locative prefix numbered 23.&lt;ref name=Maho&gt;Maho, J. F. (1999). ''A comparative study of Bantu noun classes''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hendrikse and Poulos proposed a semantic continuum for Bantu noun classes. Numbers identifying noun classes in the table are referenced from the above table giving a reconstruction of nominal classes.&lt;ref name=Maho&gt;Maho, J. F. (1999). ''A comparative study of Bantu noun classes''.&lt;/ref&gt;

This arrangement permits the classification of noun classes via nonlinguistic factors like perception and cognition. Hendrikse and Poulos have grouped singular and plural classes (such as classes 1 and 2) together, and created "hybrid positions" between the varying categories (such as the placement of class 14).&lt;ref name=Maho&gt;Maho, J. F. (1999). ''A comparative study of Bantu noun classes''.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Noun class pairings====
Classes 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, and 13 are generally accepted as being the plural forms of noun classes in Proto-Bantu. Classes 14 onward do not have a plural form defined as concretely as classes 1-13 do.

Meeussen proposed pairings of 1/2, 3/4, 5/6, 7/8, 9/10, 11/10, 12/13, 14/6, 15/6, and "probably" 19/13.&lt;ref name=Maho&gt;Maho, J. F. (1999). ''A comparative study of Bantu noun classes''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Guthrie proposed pairings of 1/2, 1a/2, 3/4, 3, 5/6, 5, 6, 7/8, 9/10, 9, 11/10, 12/13, 14, 14/6.&lt;ref name=Maho&gt;Maho, J. F. (1999). ''A comparative study of Bantu noun classes''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Guthrie&gt;Guthrie, M. (1970). ''Collected Papers on Bantu Linguistics''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Maho combines pairings by De Wolf, Meeussen, and Guthrie, offering alternative pairings such as 3/10, 3/13, 9/4, 11/4, 12/4, 14/4, 14/10, 15/4, 19/4, and 19/10.&lt;ref name=Maho&gt;Maho, J. F. (1999). ''A comparative study of Bantu noun classes''.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Vocabulary==
During the last hundred years, beginning with [[Carl Meinhof]] and his students, great efforts have been made to examine the vocabulary of the approximately 550 present day Bantu languages and to try to reconstruct the proto-forms from which they presumably came. Among other recent works is that by Bastin, Coupez, and Mann, which assembled comparative examples of 92 different words from all the 16 [[Guthrie classification of Bantu languages|language zones]] established by [[Malcolm Guthrie|Guthrie]].&lt;ref&gt;Bastin, Yvonne, André Coupez, and Michael Mann (1999). [https://doi.org/10.1515/jall.2005.26.1.111 ''Continuity and Divergence in the Bantu Languages: Perspectives from a Lexicostatistic Study.''] (Annales, 162.) Tervuren: Musée royal de l’Afrique Centrale.  225 pp.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Schadeberg&gt;Schadeberg, T. C. in Nurse, D. &amp; Philippson, G. (eds) (2006) ''The Bantu Languages'', pp. 154ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although some words are found only in certain of the Guthrie zones, others are found in every zone. These include for example *''mbʊa'' [HL] 'dog', *''-lia'' 'eat', *''ma-béele'' 'breasts', *''i-kúpa'' 'bone', *''i-jína'' 'name', *''-genda'' 'walk', *''mʊ-kíla'' 'tail', *''njɪla'' 'path', and so on.&lt;ref name=Schadeberg /&gt; (The asterisks show that these are reconstructed forms, indicating how the words are presumed to have been pronounced before the Bantu expansion began.)

Other vocabulary items tend to be found in either one or the other of the two main Bantu dialect groups, the Western group (mainly covering Guthrie zones A, B, C, H, K, L, R) or the Eastern group (covering zones D, E, F, G, M, N, P, and S). Words reconstructed for these two groups are known as "Proto-Bantu A" ("PB-A") and "Proto-Bantu B" ("PB-B") respectively, whereas those which extend over the whole Bantu area are known as "Proto-Bantu X" (or "PB-X").&lt;ref&gt;Bostoen &amp; Bastin (2016), p. 4 (see External links).&lt;/ref&gt;

Building on the work done by [[A. E. Meeussen]] in the 1960s, a publicly searchable database of all the Bantu vocabulary items which have been established or proposed so far is maintained by the [[Royal Museum for Central Africa]] at [[Tervuren]] in Belgium (see External links).

The '''quadrigatus''' was a medium-sized silver coin produced by the [[Roman Republic]] during the 3rd century BC.&lt;ref&gt;Roman Republican coinage,  Michael H. Crawford. Cambridge Press, 1974&lt;/ref&gt; The obverse featured a young [[wikt:janiform|janiform]] bust and the reverse featured [[Victoria (mythology)|Victory]] driving a [[quadriga]] (four-horse chariot), giving the coin its name, with the inscription "ROMA" below.

The coin weighed about 6.8 [[gram]]s (6 [[Apothecaries' system#Origins|scruple]]s), consistent with the weight of a south Italian Greek [[didrachm]]. It was minted for a number of years until shortly before the introduction of the [[denarius]] (211 BC or a little earlier). Gold coins of similar style were also issued at this time (staters and half-staters) which featured the same obverse type as the quadrigatus and the reverse type of two soldiers performing an oath over a third soldier holding a pig, with the inscription "ROMA" below. The choice of [[Janus (mythology)|Janus]] for these coins is believed to coincide with the closing of the doors of the [[Janus in the (Roman Forum)|Temple of Janus]], indicating the absence of warfare, a rare occasion. [[Michael Crawford (historian)|Michael Crawford]], however, has suggested that the janiform head represents the [[Dioscuri]], since Janus is usually a mature and bearded figure.&lt;ref&gt;[[Michael Crawford (historian)|Michael H. Crawford]], ''Roman Republican Coinage'' (Cambridge University Press, 1974), p. 715.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Roman historiography|Roman-era historians]] such as [[Livy]] and [[Plutarch]] often refer to these early coins as [[denarius|denarii]],&lt;ref&gt;Handbook to Life in Ancient Rome, Lesley Adkins and Roy A. Adkins. Oxford University Press, New York 1994.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Plutarch's Lives, Vol 2, John Langhorne, DD, William Langhorne, AM, London 1813&lt;/ref&gt; but modern numismatic references consider these coins as anonymous Roman silver, produced before the standardization of the denarius around 211 B.C.&lt;ref&gt;Coinage and history of the Roman empire: c. 82 B.C. - A.D. 480, Volume 2, David L. Vagi, Fitzroy Dearborn, Chicago 2000&lt;/ref&gt; The name quadrigatus comes from the quadriga or four-horse chariot on the reverse, which was the prototype for the most common designs used on Roman silver coins for the next 150 years.

The [[victoriatus]] was a later coin of the same fabric that was valued at half a quadrigatus (3 scruples).

'''''Quantum Break''''' is a [[science fiction]] [[Action-adventure game|action-adventure]] [[third-person shooter]] [[video game]] developed by [[Remedy Entertainment]] and published by [[Microsoft Studios]]. The game was released worldwide for [[Microsoft Windows]] and [[Xbox One]] in April 2016. The game centers on Jack Joyce, granted time manipulation powers after a failed time-machine experiment, as he comes into conflict with former friend Paul Serene over how to deal with an apocalyptic "End of Time". In addition, the game includes [[platform game]] elements in less action-oriented segments. There are also "junction points" that affect the game's outcome. The game features episodes of an integrated live-action television show, featuring the actors of the characters. The characters interact with the player's choices, displaying the results of the decisions made.

The game originally was envisioned as a sequel to Remedy's previous game, ''[[Alan Wake]]''. The game's focus was shifted to time travel, as Microsoft wanted a new [[intellectual property]] with interactive storytelling. The team consulted scientists while creating the fictional science in this game. While the video game portion was developed internally by Remedy and directed by studio veteran [[Sam Lake]], the TV side of the game was developed by Lifeboat Productions and directed by [[Ben Ketai]]. [[Shawn Ashmore]], [[Aidan Gillen]] and [[Lance Reddick]] portrayed important roles in the game. The game uses a new engine developed by Remedy, the Northlight engine, and a technology called [[Digital Molecular Matter]].

The game was announced in mid-2013 and was set to release in 2015, but its release was delayed to avoid competition with other Xbox One exclusives. It received a positive reception, with critics praising the game's graphics, gameplay, presentation, and story. Critics had mixed opinions regarding the platforming elements, the convergence of video game and television, and the overall quality of the TV show. The [[Windows 10]] version was criticized for its technical issues. ''Quantum Break'' was the best-selling new intellectual property published by Microsoft since the launch of Xbox One.

==Gameplay==
''Quantum Break'' is an [[action-adventure]] video game played from a [[third-person perspective]]. Players play as Jack Joyce, who has time manipulation powers in a world where time stutters, making everything freeze except Joyce.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2013-12-07-fresh-gameplay-footage-of-xbox-one-exclusive-quantum-break |title=Gameplay footage of Xbox One exclusive Quantum Break |last=Phillips |first=Tom |date=8 December 2013 |work=[[Eurogamer]] |accessdate=8 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Players face a variety of enemies, including Monarch security guards; Strikers, who are equipped with specially-designed suits which allow them to manipulate time;&lt;ref name ="GRadarPowers"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.gamesradar.com/all-quantum-breaks-time-powers-explained/ |title=All of Quantum Breaks time powers, explained |first=Joe |last=Skrebels |work=[[GamesRadar]] |date=11 February 2016 |accessdate=28 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Juggernauts, heavily armored enemies equipped with very strong firearms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.ign.com/videos/2016/04/06/quantum-break-the-heavily-armored-monarch-juggernaut-is-a-tough-fight |title=Quantum Break: The Heavily Armored Monarch Juggernaut is a Tough Fight |work=[[IGN]] |date=6 April 2016 |accessdate=28 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Different enemies have different behaviors, and the game requires players to deploy different tactics and strategies in order to defeat them.&lt;ref name="VentureBeatTips"/&gt;

[[File:Quantum Break gameplay screenshot.jpg |thumb |left |In this screenshot, the [[player character]] is using Time Stop to defeat enemies]]
To defeat enemies, players can make use of various offensive and defensive abilities. Jack can find four types of firearms: pistols, assault rifles, shotguns, and carbine rifles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.primagames.com/games/quantum-break/feature/best-guns-quantum-break |title=The Best Guns in Quantum Break |first=Robert |last=Workman |work=[[Prima Games]] |date=8 April 2016 |accessdate=28 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also possesses several types of time manipulating powers, which increase his efficiency in combat. "Time Stop" freezes time around enemies with a time bubble. If the player shoots an opponent trapped in the bubble, its power amplifies, and the bullets will kill the enemy when the bubble vanishes after a short period of time.&lt;ref name= "GRadarPowers"/&gt; "Time Rush" allows Jack to dash next to an enemy and perform an immediate melee takedown.&lt;ref name="DSpy"/&gt; He can also use this power to speed up time and dodge between cover to confuse unaware enemies as to his location.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.destructoid.com/quantum-break-piqued-my-curiosity-but-it-still-has-a-lot-to-prove-279726.phtml |title=Quantum Break piqued my curiosity, but it still has a lot to prove| first=Brett| last=Makedonski| work=[[Destructoid]]| date=21 August 2015| accessdate=4 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Time Blast" levitates enemies and freezes them.&lt;ref name="VentureBeatTips"&gt;{{cite web |url= https://venturebeat.com/2016/04/05/quantum-break-tips-and-tricks-that-will-keep-you-from-getting-stuck-in-time/ |title=Quantum Break tips and tricks that keep you from getting stuck in time |first=Dean |last=Takahashi |work=[[VentureBeat]] |date=5 April 2016 |accessdate=28 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The defensive ability "Time Shield" deflects all incoming damage, while "Time Dodge" allows players to dash quickly to evade attacks. Most of these time manipulating powers have a short [[cooldown]] period after use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.gamespot.com/articles/killing-time-in-quantum-break/1100-6434682/ |title=Killing Time in Quantum Break |first=Tamoor |last=Hussain |work=[[GameSpot]] |date=11 February 2016| accessdate=28 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In combat, Jack automatically takes cover when he is standing next to environmental objects.&lt;ref name="DSpytips"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.digitalspy.com/gaming/xbox-one/feature/a788867/quantum-break-guide-tips-and-tricks-for-taking-on-monarch/ |title=Quantum Break guide: Tips and tricks for taking on Monarch |first=Sam |last=Loveridge |work=[[Digital Spy]] |date=1 April 2016 |accessdate=28 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the [[artificial intelligence]] in the game is designed to push the player out of cover by coordinating with each other.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.gamesradar.com/quantum-break-secretly-sweet-max-payne-game/| title=Quantum Break is secretly a sweet Max Payne game|first=Joe |last= Skerebels |work=[[GamesRadar]] |date=11 February 2016| accessdate=28 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jack has other time powers that are not used in combat. "Time Vision" reveals points of interest, and highlights interactive objects and enemies.&lt;ref name="GRadarPowers"/&gt; "Time Echoes" allow him to locate enemies and allies, and replay past events, providing additional information about the story.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://news.xbox.com/2016/04/08/a-deeper-look-at-quantum-breaks-time-shifting-powers/ |title=A Deeper Look at Quantum Break’s Time-Shifting Powers |first=Andrew |last=Fitch |work=Xbox.com |date=8 April 2016 |accessdate=28 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.pcgamer.com/hands-on-with-quantum-breaks-strange-blend-of-gunplay-and-tv-show/ |title=Hands on with Quantum Break's strange blend of gunplay and TV show |first=Tim |last=Clark |work=[[PC Gamer]] |date=1 March 2016 |accessdate=28 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The game features several types of collectibles known as "narrative objects",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.destructoid.com/quantum-break-plays-like-a-dream-345679.phtml|title=Quantum Break plays like a dream|first=Steven|last=Hansen|work=[[Destructoid]]|date=1 March 2016|accessdate=28 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; including quantum ripples, documents, computers, and media. They give players additional insight into the game's story and background. Players can collect "chronon sources", which can be used as [[experience (gaming)|experience point]]s to purchase time power enhancements.&lt;ref name="VentureBeatTips"/&gt;

There are also less action-oriented segments in the game, where players have to solve [[puzzle game|environmental puzzles]], which usually function as a [[Video game graphics|3D]] [[platform game|platformer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2014-08-20-is-quantum-break-more-than-a-run-of-the-mill-third-person-shooter |title=Is there more to Quantum Break than run-of-the-mill third-person shooting? |first=Wesley |last=Yin-Poole |work=[[Eurogamer]] |date=20 August 2014 |accessdate=4 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; With time stuttering and collapsing, objects may get trapped in a time loop and either become platforms for players to proceed into the next section of the game, or create dangerous environmental hazards, which are extremely unstable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.vg247.com/2015/08/11/quantum-breaks-action-looks-familiar-but-its-fmv-twist-is-fresh/ |title=Quantum Break’s action looks familiar, but its FMV twist is fresh |first=Alex |last=Donaldson |work=[[VG247]] |date=11 August 2015| accessdate=4 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.videogamer.com/xboxone/quantum_break/preview-3763.html |title=Quantum Break: Gaming's Hollywood action-thriller – Gamescom 2014 |first=John |last=Robertson |work=VideoGamer.com |date=15 August 2014 |accessdate=4 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the latter case they become obstacles that block the player's path. Jack can overcome them by using his time manipulation powers, such as slowing down or stopping time, so that he can proceed without getting hurt. He can also revive frozen [[non-playable characters]] at several specific points of the game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://uk.ign.com/articles/2014/08/13/gamescom-2014-quantum-break-looks-fun-to-play-but-will-it-be-fun-to-watch |title=Gamescom 2014: Quantum Break Looks Fun To Play, But Will It Be Fun To Watch? |first=Tristan |last=Oglivie |date=13 August 2014 |accessdate=4 October 2015 |work=[[IGN]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The gameplay splits into five acts. After playing through an act of the game as Jack Joyce, players take control of the antagonist Paul Serene for a pivotal concurrent decision that impacts the plot, before an episode of the digital show will play. In the game, the video game portion tells the story of the protagonists while the show tells the story of the antagonists. Players can make choices at the beginning of each episode of the TV show, also known as "junction points." These decisions influence the state of the game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.gameinformer.com/b/news/archive/2013/11/22/remedy-s-sam-lake-details-quantum-break-s-transmedia-approach.aspx |title=Remedy’s Sam Lake Details Quantum Break’s Transmedia Approach |first=Mike |last=Futter |work=[[Game Informer]] |date=22 November 2013 |accessdate=28 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="DSpyadventure"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.digitalspy.com/gaming/feature/a662707/quantum-break-is-part-game-part-live-action-tv-show-part-choose-your-own-adventure.html#~pq8TNpEq0EmqDi |title=Quantum Break is part game, part live-action TV show, part choose your own adventure |first=Matthew |last=Reynolds |work=[[Digital Spy]] |date=15 August 2015 |accessdate=4 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; As Paul Serene has [[precognition|precognitive]] power, players can view the consequences of each choice before making a decision.&lt;ref name="VentureBeatTips"/&gt;

''Quantum Break'' is set at and around Riverport, where, due to miscalculations by Paul Serene, a [[time travel]] experiment goes wrong.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.polygon.com/2013/6/13/4427698/quantum-break-xbox-one |title=Quantum Break Brings Binge Viewing To Video Games |last=Plante |first=Chris |work=[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]] |date=13 June 2013 |accessdate=21 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Doused in chronon radiation, the material that makes time travel possible, Jack Joyce and Paul Serene are granted time-based abilities; for example, both can freeze time and move at higher speeds, whilst a higher dose of chronons means Serene can [[Precognition|see into the future]] to decide which choices to make in the present.&lt;ref name="wondering"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://kotaku.com/quantum-breaks-creator-says-its-tv-game-hybrid-makes-p-512948212 |title=If You're Wondering What The Hell Quantum Break Is, Here You Go |last=Amini |first=Tina |work=[[Kotaku]] |date=12 June 2013 |accessdate=21 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, the collapse of the machine damages the structure of time, causing a "fracture" that sporadically freezes the passage of time for all without time-travel abilities or the correct equipment. Joyce and his ally, Beth Wilder, are subsequently pursued by Monarch Solutions, a corporation founded by Serene.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://remedygames.com/quantum-break-e3-trailer/?_ga=1.11838388.1246741597.1427452777|title = Quantum Break E3 trailer|date = 10 June 2013|accessdate = 4 August 2015|website = [[Remedy Games]]|publisher = |last = |first = |deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20151117014932/http://remedygames.com/quantum-break-e3-trailer/?_ga=1.11838388.1246741597.1427452777|archivedate = 17 November 2015|df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The rules of the story stress that time cannot be changed through traveller actions as per the [[Novikov self-consistency principle]]; Paul Serene gives an example of trying to save a dead vagrant he and Jack discovered in their youth, only to startle the vagrant and cause the fall that killed him when he goes back in time. Another enforced rule is that travelers can only move between machines located at different times using the same core: as such, it is impossible for the characters to travel back before the first power-up of the core, nor would they be able to travel between different time machines as the cores would be different. The game features narration from Jack himself.&lt;ref name="VG" /&gt;

=== Plot ===
{{See also|List of Quantum Break episodes}}
Agreeing to help his best friend Paul Serene with a demonstration, Jack Joyce learns that Paul has been expanding on the physics work of Jack's estranged brother, William, and has built a time machine that works using "chronon particles." Paul activates the machine, only for it to jam shut and break as William appears. Will demands Jack and Paul stop their actions, else "time will break." The machine becomes unstable and douses Jack and Paul in chronon radiation that gives them time-based powers. Monarch Solutions soldiers appear and steal the time machine's core, Jack and Will meet an older Paul. Claiming to have seen the "End of Time", this Paul refuses Will's suggestions of fixing the fracture, claiming time cannot be changed. Paul has the building detonated, causing Will to be seemingly killed by falling debris. Jack is knocked unconscious and captured by Monarch.

Escaping Monarch during a time stutter, Jack rescues either Nick or Amy, students apprehended by Monarch who agree to help him. Working off a clue with Beth Wilder, a friend of Will's working as double agent inside Monarch, Jack heads to the abandoned Bradbury Swimming Pool, where he finds that Will has built his own time machine and a counter-measure to fix the fracture, called the Chronon Field Regulator (CFR), but the time machine is inoperable. Jack suggests they kidnap Dr. Sofia Amaral, Paul's head of chronon research. Learning she will be attending a Monarch gala, Jack surrenders to Monarch and learns that Paul was accidentally sent to the end of time in the future, only escaping by traveling in Will's machine back to its first activation in 1999. Escaping through the Monarch Labs, Jack and Beth pull Amaral out of the path of a hacked drone before it explodes. Beth escapes by the sea with Amaral while Jack steals Paul's car.

Paul revealed to be dying from "chronon syndrome,"{{efn|Caused by overexposure to chronon radiation, the illness is detrimental to his health and incurable and requires medical chronon exposure, similarly to real-life [[radiotherapy]]. The disease is implied to be what allows him to see possible futures, unlike Jack.}} lashes out at his second-in-command Martin Hatch, as Amaral was the only one capable of administering his treatment. Now paranoid, Paul places all of his trust in either Amaral or Hatch, who claims that Amaral left willingly with Jack. Paul recognizes Beth from security footage— she was also at the end of time and attempted to kill Serene.

Taking Amaral to the Bradbury Pool, Jack and Beth force her to help repair the time machine. With Will's documents noting that the CFR disappeared in 2010, Jack and Beth plot to head to 2010 and steal it, closing a [[causal loop]]. Beth steps into the machine as Amaral sabotages the computer and alerts Monarch. Leaving Amaral with Nick/Amy, Jack heads to 2010 and finds Beth, much older and disturbed. Beth explains that Amaral sent her to the end of time, where she met the younger Paul. Failing to kill him, Beth followed him back to the first activation in 1999 and stopped him from murdering Will. After directing Will to create the CFR, she has waited eleven years for Jack to arrive in 2010.

Beth and Jack reach Will's workshop and find the CFR, but Paul corners Beth and shoots her when she refuses to co-operate. The CFR is accidentally activated, causing a chronon burst; the exposure throws Jack forward to 2016 again and causes Paul's chronon syndrome. Beth shuts off the CFR but is executed by Paul while Jack can only watch through time.

Increasingly paranoid and ill, Paul is informed that, despite his lab being destroyed by Hatch, one damaged treatment has been recovered. Paul either decides to take it and buy time for himself and his plan or succumb to paranoia and illness. As stutters become nearly constant, Jack fights through the Monarch HQ with the guidance of either head of surveillance Charlie Wincott or Wincott's close friend Fiona Miller. Reaching Paul's lab, Jack finds either Wincott or high-level Monarch security officer Liam Burke, who is intent on stopping him. Acquiring the CFR, Jack learns that Paul was using it to power a "lifeboat," a small bunker where researchers could devise a solution to the end of time while protected from it. Unable to work the CFR, Jack uses Monarch's time machine (equipped with the stolen university core) to travel back to its first activation: the night of Will's death.

Rushing through the University, Jack narrowly rescues Will from the falling debris. Will warns Jack he cannot simply repair the fracture then and there, as it would erase key future events and risk a [[time paradox]]. Passing a frozen Beth during a stutter, Jack reaches to unfreeze her but hesitates and leaves. Reaching the Bradbury Pool, Jack and Will travel forward in time, only to find Paul and Monarch waiting for them. Paul is intent on either retrieving the CFR or destroying it. Jack fights and kills him. Hooking the CFR into his time machine, Will asks Jack to [[jump start (vehicle)|jumpstart]] it with chronon energy. The CFR activates and blasts the area with chronons, fixing the tear and vaporizing Paul. As Will examines the CFR, burnt out from the blast, Jack has a vision of his future self-traveling to the end of time and begins exhibiting symptoms of chronon syndrome.

In a flash-forward, Jack is shown approaching the frozen Beth back at the University, whispering that he'll come back for her. An epilogue shows Jack leaving an interview and being approached by Hatch,{{efn|Despite Hatch's death being shown in Episode 4, additional collectibles and a [[Flashback (narrative)|flashback]] imply that Hatch is a shifter capable of self-control and living in spaces with time.}} who explains everything has been simply blamed on Paul, and offers Jack a place at the renewed Monarch; Jack is shown seeing a split pathway similarly to Paul, ending before he makes a decision.&lt;ref name="VG"&gt;{{cite video game |title=Quantum Break |developer=[[Remedy Entertainment]] |publisher=[[Microsoft Studios]] |date=5 April 2016 |platform=[[Xbox One]] |version=1.0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development==

===Origin===
[[File:Sam Lake-MichaelFörtsch.jpg|thumb|150px|right|''Quantum Break'' is directed by [[Sam Lake]].]]
''Quantum Break'' was developed by Finnish developer [[Remedy Entertainment]] and published by [[Microsoft Studios]]. In 2010, the company released ''[[Alan Wake]]'', another title published by Microsoft. The game received high critical praise but was not a significant commercial success for either company. Remedy intended to develop a sequel to ''Alan Wake'' after the release of the first game, and hoped to include live action elements into the game. The concept was pitched to Microsoft, who showed no interest in publishing another ''Alan Wake'' game and wanted to diversify their games lineup.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.polygon.com/features/2015/4/20/8450329/alan-wake-2-prototype-video-interview |title=Introducing The Alan Wake 2 You Will Never Play |first=Brian |last=Crecente |work=[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]] |date=20 April 2015 |accessdate=29 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, Microsoft was impressed by the idea of having a live action show within a video game, wanted to publish a game featuring interactive narrative. They hoped to partner with Remedy for a new [[intellectual property]], in which Remedy could expand the live action part of the game; Remedy agreed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2016-03-07-remedy-is-still-in-talks-about-alan-wake-2| title=Remedy still in talks about Alan Wake 2 |first=Martin |last=Robinson |work=[[Eurogamer]] |date=7 March 2016| accessdate=29 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The team believed that one of the best themes that can accommodate a story with choices was [[time travel]], as the general idea of this kind of story is to change past events. The idea of having a game about quantum physics originated from ''Alan Wake''{{'}}s additional TV show called 
"Quantum Suicide".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.gameinformer.com/b/features/archive/2015/11/16/new-gameplay-and-insight-into-quantum-breaks-origins.aspx| title=Microsoft's Long Game: Inside Quantum Break's Challenging Development| first=Ben| last=Hanson| work=[[Game Informer]]| date=16 November 2015| accessdate=30 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.gamespot.com/articles/on-building-dueling-narratives-in-quantum-break/1100-6435197/ |title=On Building Dueling Narratives in Quantum Break |first=Alexa |last=Ray Corriea |work=[[GameSpot]] |date=1 March 2016 |accessdate=30 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; After settling on the genre, the team pitched the project to Microsoft again and was accepted.&lt;ref name="PolyFeature"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.polygon.com/2015/8/6/9107169/quantum-break-details-gamescom-xbox-one-remedy-sam-lake |title=How you'll play and watch Quantum Break (and why you shouldn't skip the cutscenes) |first=Dave |last=Tach |work=[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]] |date=6 August 2015 |accessdate=29 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The game was directed by [[Sam Lake]], the writer of ''Alan Wake'' and Remedy's previous games, ''[[Max Payne (video game)|Max Payne]]'' and ''[[Max Payne 2: The Fall of Max Payne]]''. Greg Louden, who received an [[Academy Award for Visual Effects]] for his work in ''[[Gravity (film)|Gravity]]'', served as a narrative designer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.gameinformer.com/b/news/archive/2014/03/05/remedy-s-greg-louden-discusses-his-work-on-gravity-and-quantum-break.aspx |title=Remedy’s Greg Louden Discusses His Work On Gravity And Quantum Break |first=Mike |last=Futter |work=[[Game Informer]] |date=5 March 2014 |accessdate=30 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ben Ketai]] was the TV show's director.&lt;ref name="show director"/&gt; Pre-production of the game began in 2011; approximately 100 people worked on the game.&lt;ref name="Complicated story"&gt;{{cite web|url= https://venturebeat.com/2016/03/01/how-remedy-kept-control-of-a-very-complicated-story-across-the-quantum-break-games-and-video-episodes/ |title=How Remedy controlled a complicated story across the Quantum Break games and videos |first=Dean |last=Takahashi |work=[[VentureBeat]] |date=1 March 2016 |accessdate=30 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Story===
{{quotebox|quote= "We really consciously wanted to take our learnings from the previous games and push the idea of what makes a good Remedy game forward. Take all the storytelling lessons from ''Alan Wake'', take the cinematic action lessons from ''Max Payne'', and combine it all into one game." |width=33% |source = — [[Sam Lake]], creative director of the game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.standard.co.uk/stayingin/tech-gaming/quantum-break-interview-sam-lake-on-storytelling-scifi-blockbusters-and-why-it-s-the-ultimate-remedy-a3215536.html |title=Quantum Break interview: Sam Lake on storytelling, sci-fi blockbusters, and why it’s ‘the ultimate Remedy game’ |first=Ben |last=Travis |work=[[Standard.co.uk]] |date=March 31, 2016 |accessdate=June 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The game's story was written by a team of three full-time writers along with Lake, with a goal of making it "believable". As a result, the team drew numerous inspirations from [[popular culture|pop culture]] and included various references to films like ''[[Inception]]'' and ''[[Interstellar (film)|Interstellar]]''. The team was also inspired by ''[[The Matrix]]'', ''[[The Terminator]]'', ''[[Back to the Future]]'', ''[[Primer (film)|Primer]]'', ''[[Looper (film)|Looper]]'', and other films.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.gameinformer.com/b/features/archive/2015/11/18/remedy-s-favorite-tv-shows-and-the-time-travel-movies-influencing-quantum-break.aspx?PostPageIndex=2 |title=Remedy’s Top TV Shows And The Time-Travel Movies Influencing Quantum Break |first=Kyle |last=Hilliard| work=[[Game Informer]] |date=18 November 2015 |accessdate=30 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The game's story was described as "complicated", and Louden had to create a chart for the team to keep track of the story progression.&lt;ref name="Complicated story"/&gt; Lake described the game as Remedy's most ambitious project and the "ultimate Remedy game", since the team learnt from ''Alan Wake'' and attempted to refine the formula. As in ''Alan Wake'', the game's theme revolves around family. Lake also drew inspiration from the pacing and plot twists of TV shows, and hoped that the game's story would be unpredictable.&lt;ref name="GSpot TPS"&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.gamespot.com/articles/quantum-break-interview-its-the-most-ambitious-gam/1100-6434705/ |title=Quantum Break Interview: "It’s The Most Ambitious Game We’ve Worked On" |first=Tamoor |last=Hussain |work=[[GameSpot]] |date=12 February 2016 |accessdate=30 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also reinterpreted familiar film [[cliché]]s in an attempt to make dated ideas fresh again.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2016/04/a-remedy-for-cliches-sam-lake-on-quantum-break.html |title=A Remedy for Clichés: Sam Lake on Quantum Break |first=Cameron |last=Kunzelman   |date=1 April 2016 |accessdate=30 June 2016 |work=[[Paste Magazine]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; To add dimensions, the team took inspirations from postmodern literature and included many self-references, such as a standalone TV show called ''Alan Wake's Return''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.pcgamer.com/sam-lake-quantum-break-alan-wake-max-payne-interview/ |title=Sam Lake on Quantum Break and what's next for Alan Wake |first=Tyler |last=Wilde |work=[[PC Gamer]] |date=1 April 2016 |accessdate=30 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The game's "junction point" concept was created by Louden. There are approximately 40 variations in the game TV show, triggered by "quantum ripples", which unlock deleted scenes and give players additional insight on the story, and junction points. The player plays part of the game as Paul Serene and makes decisions as him at these points. Inspired by ''[[Die Hard]]'', the writers hoped that this approach would allow them to create a complex villain with depth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.gameinformer.com/b/news/archive/2013/11/22/remedy-s-sam-lake-details-quantum-break-s-transmedia-approach.aspx |title=Remedy’s Sam Lake Details Quantum Break’s Transmedia Approach |first=Mike |last=Futter |work=[[Game Informer]] |date=22 November 2013| accessdate=30 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Louden, the story characters are not "black and white", and depending on the player's perspective, players will feel sympathy for the villain and feel torn when making the choices. Junction points were a tool used by Remedy to add replayability to the game, unlocking alternate content and changing the state of the world,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.shacknews.com/article/93637/quantum-break-narrative-designer-discusses-junction-points-time-powers-and-episodic-gaming |title=Quantum Break narrative designer discusses Junction points, time powers, and episodic gaming |first=Ozzie |last=Mejia |work=[[Shacknews]] |date=8 March 2016 |accessdate=30 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the gameplay segments remain identical regardless of players' choices.&lt;ref name="Complicated story"/&gt;

''Quantum Break'' was described as a "transmedia action-shooter video game and television hybrid".&lt;ref name="feature"/&gt; At its core the game is an [[action-adventure game|action-adventure]] game with a live action TV show bundled with it. According to Lake, the product was designed to be a complete package, players are encouraged to both play the game and watch the show. While the game allows players to skip the TV show completely, Remedy advise against such behaviors, as players may miss crucial details if they do not watch the show. The game features many collectibles, which serve a narrative purpose. Lake explained that once players find a collectible, they will trigger a [[butterfly effect]], whose consequences will be shown during the show. The show also shows some objects, which can be found in the core game. Through this approach, the team hoped that they could offer an experience that is unique and personalized for all players, and increase the depth of the story.&lt;ref name="PolyFeature"/&gt; Initially, the game and the TV show were to tell drastically different stories featuring a completely different set of characters. However, Lake eventually scrapped the idea, and the game and the show echo each other more closely.&lt;ref name="venturebeat"&gt;{{cite web|url= https://venturebeat.com/2016/04/11/remedys-sam-lake-stepped-up-the-creativity-and-ambition-with-microsofts-quantum-break/ |title=How Remedy’s Sam Lake stepped up the ambition and creativity of Quantum Break | first=Dean| last=Takahashi |work=[[VentureBeat]] |date=11 April 2016 |accessdate=29 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lake described the TV show as a "natural progression" for the studio, having experimented with the format with the two ''Max Payne'' games, which feature televisions, and ''Alan Wake'', which has the ''Bright Falls'' live action show,&lt;ref name="NL"/&gt; and ''[[Alan Wake: American Nightmare]]'', which features live-action cutscenes.&lt;ref name="venturebeat"/&gt; Producer Thomas Puha added that the game is "the culmination of 21 years of work".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=  https://www.vg247.com/2016/03/04/quantum-break-gameplay/ |title=Quantum Break is "the culmination of 21 years of work" |first=Danny |last=Wadeson |work=[[VG247]] |date=4 March 2016 |accessdate=30 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lake added that the TV part can serve as an entry point for people who do not play video games frequently, and draw them into video gaming.&lt;ref name="feature"/&gt; To keep both parts consistent, the team also consulted a filmmaker who gave them advice regarding the game's camera styles and depth of field to allow smooth transitions between the two mediums.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.polygon.com/2014/8/12/5991679/quantum-break-remedy-entertainment-cinematic-director |title=A filmmaker is helping to make Quantum Break the most cinematic game Remedy has ever made |first=Emily |last=Gera |date=12 August 2014 |accessdate=30 June 2016 |work= [[Polygon (website)|Polygon]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lake initially thought Microsoft was not particularly enthusiastic about the idea, but had accepted the pitch mainly because of Microsoft's vision of having Xbox One as an entertainment device with rich TV features at that time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=  http://www.mcvuk.com/news/read/remedy-s-quantum-leap-sam-lake-on-the-studio-s-most-ambitious-game-yet/0164881 |title=Remedy's Quantum leap: Sam Lake talks about the studio's most ambitious game yet |first=Alex |last=Calvin |work=[[Market for Home Computing and Video Games]] |date=1 April 2016 |accessdate=30 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, as the TV show was not part of Microsoft's project, the closure of [[Xbox Entertainment Studios]] did not affect the progress of the TV show production.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.engadget.com/2014/07/18/quantum-break-not-impacted-by-xbox-entertainment-studios-closure/ |title=Quantum Break not impacted by Xbox Entertainment Studios closure| first=Sinan| last=Kubba| work=[[Engadget]]| date=18 July 2014| accessdate=30 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was created by Lifeboat Productions, who worked closely with Remedy through [[Skype]] conversation and screenplay review. Many scenes had to be shot twice due to the game's alternate content and branching nature. Three writers from Remedy also contributed to the TV show content.&lt;ref name="Complicated story"/&gt;

With Microsoft's funding, Remedy hired lots of high-profile actors, including [[Shawn Ashmore]], [[Aidan Gillen]], [[Lance Reddick]] and [[Dominic Monaghan]]. During the game's announcement and first gameplay reveal at [[Gamescom 2014]], Jack Joyce was portrayed by Shaun Derry. According to Louden, they were creating the animation for Ashmore's character, and did not have sufficient time to finalize them before the event, so they used their game prototype, which has Derry starring as the lead character, as the game's demo. The change in lead actors also prompted the studio to update and change the game cover art.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/08/15/quantum-break-gets-box-art-redesign |title=New Quantum Break Box Art Revealed |first=Alex |last=Osborn |work=[[IGN]] |date=15 August 2015 |accessdate=30 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ashmore, Monaghan and Gillen were announced as the game's protagonists and antagonists a year later, and Derry starred in the game as Nick.&lt;ref name="venturebeat"/&gt;

===Design===
While developing the game, Remedy consulted Syksy Räsänen, a scientist who is a lecturer at [[Helsinki University]] and had worked at [[CERN]]. She taught them how to write the plot in such a way that it adhered to current [[theoretical physics]] and [[quantum physics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wired.co.uk/article/quantum-break-interview-sam-lake|title=How real physics impacted time-travel game Quantum Break|work=[[Wired.co.uk]]|date=30 March 2016|accessdate=30 June 2016|first=Matt|last=Kamen}}&lt;/ref&gt; The development team held several brainstorming sessions, which inspired the team and helped them to fix the design of the game's time machine. The team was also inspired, when creating their own fictional "Meyer-Joyce particle" and "Meyer-Joyce field", by the [[Higgs boson]] and Higgs fields.&lt;ref name="venturebeat"/&gt;

According to Lake, they experimented with different gameplay mechanics, some of which they judged to make the game too slow or too tactical. They intended to "recapture the action spectacle" featured in their ''[[Max Payne (video game)|Max Payne]]'' series, along with several modern iterations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://metro.co.uk/2016/03/09/quantum-break-hands-on-preview-and-interview-we-wanted-to-recapture-the-action-spectacle-we-had-with-max-payne-5741405/ |title=Quantum Break hands-on preview and interview – ‘we wanted to recapture the action spectacle we had with Max Payne’ |first=David |last=Jenkins |work=[[Metro (magazine)|Metro]] |date=9 March 2016 |accessdate=30 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The game was designed to be fast-paced, but the concept of time-travel did not accommodate the elements of this kind of gameplay. As a result, the team opted to include a broader theme: time itself. They set the game in a world where time collapses, leading to various dangerous situations. According to Lake, the theme of time connected all the elements featured in the game. The setting also allowed the team to add new gameplay mechanics, such as the time manipulation powers.&lt;ref name="venturebeat"/&gt; They created ''Quantum Break'' as a [[third-person shooter]] because of their past experiences with the genre and because they thought that the third-person perspective would allow them to show a strong leading character, while a purely story-oriented game would not feel like a [[AAA (video game industry)|triple A]] title.&lt;ref name="GSpot TPS"/&gt;

Louden says the team put a lot of work into the game's difficulty. They hoped that the time powers would let the player feel like a [[superhero]], while still allowing for challenging moments.&lt;ref name="Complicated story"/&gt; Learning from criticism of ''Alan Wake'', they introduced several puzzles in order to increase variety and change the pace.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= https://www.telegraph.co.uk/gaming/what-to-play/quantum-break-interview-pc-release-date-and-new-trailer/ |title=Quantum Break interview, PC release date and new trailer |first=Tom |last=Hoggins |work=[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]] |date= 11 February 2015 |accessdate= 30 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The puzzles also serve to remind players of their arsenal of abilities. Some of the environmental puzzles, including the rewind feature, were inspired by titles like ''[[Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time]]'' and ''[[Life Is Strange]]'', while the stutter sequences were inspired by ''[[Salvador Dali (film)|Salvador Dali]]'' and ''Inception'''s dream sequence.&lt;ref name="Complicated story"/&gt;

When time stutters occur, the game's visual changes to inform players that they will encounter new enemies and obstacles. The levels in the game were designed to feature open environments to allow players to use the time manipulation powers freely and encouraging them to explore. Kyle Rowley, lead designer of the game, described them as "arenas". The stutters were also designed to convey stories: Players can inspect the [[non-playable character]]s stuck in a time stutter and learn about what happened to them when time freezes. To prevent the game from relying excessively on its cover system, the [[artificial intelligence]] (AI) of the game was designed to attack the player aggressively in order to drive the player out from cover. Time powers affect AI behaviors, and Remedy built a new system that allows the AI to search for the player character after Time Rush is used.&lt;ref name="level design"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-quantum-breaks-developers-tackled-time-manipul/1100-6436820/ |title=How Quantum Break's Developers Tackled Time Manipulation Combat |first=Justin |last=Haywald |work=[[GameSpot]] |date=3 April 2016 |accessdate=30 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Technology===
The game utilizes a new in-house engine called the Northlight Engine.&lt;ref name="NL"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gameinformer.com/games/quantum_break/b/xboxone/archive/2013/06/21/remedy-s-sam-lake-talks-quantum-break-and-alan-wake-2.aspx|title=Remedy’s Sam Lake Talks Quantum Break And Alan Wake 2|first=Tim|last=Turi|work=[[Game Informer]]|date=21 June 2013|accessdate=29 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; To represent the idea of "broken time" and have a detailed destruction system, the team created lots of environments which put the player character in the midst of destruction, utilizing technologies ranging from geometric distortion waves to Thinking Particles.&lt;ref name="tech"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fxguide.com/featured/time-for-destruction-the-tech-of-quantum-break/|title=Time for destruction: the tech of Quantum Break|first=Ian|last=Failes|work=FX Guide|date=21 April 2016|accessdate=29 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The team also used [[Digital Molecular Matter]], a technology developed by Pixelux that allows structures and objects to react in the game the same way they would in reality. According to Mikko Uromo, the technology allows them to "simulate complex scenarios on a scale that hasn't been possible before" and is crucial to the game's development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.videogamer.com/xboxone/quantum_break/news/quantum_break_gets_advanced_digital_molecular_matter_destruction_tech.html |title=Quantum Break gets advanced 'Digital Molecular Matter' destruction tech |first=David |last=Scammell |work=VideoGamer.com |date=25 November 2013 |accessdate=29 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The team also worked significantly on the game's lighting system. It was designed to be dynamic, and the team refined it to include eyes and hair. They also created a new [[global illumination]] system for indirect lighting.&lt;ref name="tech"/&gt; The game's [[Display resolution|resolution]] foundation was [[720p]], but Remedy attempted to raise it to [[1080p]] by using [[3D reconstruction|temporal reconstruction]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.gamespot.com/articles/quantum-breaks-resolution-is-a-complicated-issue-s/1100-6435898/ |title=Quantum Break's Resolution Is a Complicated Issue, Says Dev |first=Tamoor |last=Hussain |work=[[GameSpot]] |date=22 March 2016 |accessdate=30 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The team spent a lot of resources in carrying out detailed [[motion capture]], to enhance players' engagement with the story and make it easier for them to form emotional attachments to characters, and to keep the game and the TV show consistent with each other. They also hoped that use of this technology would add realism to the game and prevent players from getting distracted by the characters' unrealistic behaviors and appearances.&lt;ref name="feature"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.polygon.com/2013/6/13/4427698/quantum-break-xbox-one |title=Quantum Break Brings Binge Viewing To Video Games |first=Chris |last=Plante |work=[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]] |date=13 June 2013 |accessdate=26 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lake added that one of the challenges when recording motion capture is to convince the inexperienced actors, who thought that the system lacked complexity, not to overact. According to Lake, the game features a technology that creates realistic digital counterparts of the characters and records every little detail of their faces.&lt;ref name="NL"/&gt; The team initially did the recording at [[Los Angeles]], where actors need to wear spandex suits with tracking marks and head cameras. Remedy invited the actors to Remedy's office in [[Helsinki]], where they used their own technology to carry out extremely detailed motion capturing of facial expressions and movements in dialogue. Ashmore described the chamber for motion capturing as a "Sweat Box", as actors must remain steady, moving only their faces, in order to prevent the motion capture data from getting ruined.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite interview |last=Ashmore |first=Shawn |subject= |subject-link= Shawn Ashmore |interviewer= Matthew Jarvis |title=Quantum Break actor details Remedy's 'Sweat Box' method for photorealistic facial capture |url= http://www.develop-online.net/news/quantum-break-actor-details-remedy-s-sweat-box-method-for-photorealistic-facial-capture/0219650 |format= |date= 26 April 2016 |access-date=30 June 2016 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20160427114012/http://www.develop-online.net/news/quantum-break-actor-details-remedy-s-sweat-box-method-for-photorealistic-facial-capture/0219650 |archive-date=27 April 2016 |dead-url=no |quote= It’s this tiny little room with nine cameras and it captures your facial performance to an almost photo-real level.

As you can imagine the game is highly action-oriented, and very emotional – there’s a lot of emotion and yelling and screaming and breaking down, for all the characters for various different reasons.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Audio===
According to Remedy, audio drives the visual effects. The development team put a lot of effort into differentiating normal time and time stutters. When time enters a stutter, many audio effects change, with guns firing at a lower pitch, while dialogue and music began stretching.&lt;ref name="level design"/&gt; The goal for the change was to allow players to recognize the change of time state "with their eyes shut". The team wrote a reference guide, describing the sound of time stutters. They chose words including "violent" and "unpredictable", but avoided using "sci-fi" and "digital". The team also used [[Audiokinetic Wwise]] to sync audio with gameplay.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.develop-online.net/interview/heard-about-quantum-break/0218665 |title=Heard About: Quantum Break |first=John |last=Broomhall |work=[[Develop (magazine)|Develop]] |date=1 April 2016 |accessdate=30 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The game's soundtrack was composed by Petri Alanko, the composer of ''Alan Wake''. Alanko made use of the modular audio software [[Reaktor]], but was not satisfied with the software's built-in instruments and decided to create his own set of custom sounds. The music in the game was described by Alanko as "meandering" and "sublime" to support the game's emotional moments, while intentionally avoiding aggressive tones.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/272143/Making_waves_The_organic_process_of_creating_Quantum_Breaks_score.php |title= Making waves: The organic process of creating Quantum Break's score |first=Chris |last=Kerr |work=[[Gamasutra]] |date=9 May 2016 |accessdate=30 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The soundtrack was inspired by albums from [[Tangerine Dream]], [[Hecq]], [[Michael Stearns]] and [[Aphex Twin]], and Reznorian. He intended to add [[orchestra]]l soundtrack into the game, but Microsoft rejected the idea. The music changed to an [[electronic music|electronic]] style, and he used artificial instruments such as [[Roland Corporation|Roland]] synthesizers.&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube |6iXK45viIuo |Petri Alanko on composing for Quantum Break with Roland AIRA System-1M}}, promotional video taken from the official Roland YouTube channel, accessed 9 April 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.gamespot.com/articles/listen-to-quantum-breaks-soundtrack-early/1100-6435775/ |title=Listen to Quantum Break's Soundtrack Early |work=[[GameSpot]] |date=18 March 2016 |accessdate=30 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[iam8bit]] is set to release a [[Gramophone record|vinyl]] limited edition of the game's soundtrack in the third quarter of 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/04/05/quantum-break-soundtrack-coming-to-vinyl |title=Quantum Break Soundtrack Coming To Vinyl |first=Luke |last=Reilly |work=[[IGN]]| date=5 April 2016| accessdate=30 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015 Lifeboat Productions hired [[John Kaefer]] for the soundtrack of the TV show. Kaefer and Alanko did not cooperate with each other closely as the level of interactivity between the two mediums are different. Due to the game's alternate content, he had to compose several music pieces for some scenes. As the TV show served to expand on the story and provide explanation, the music reflects the "ideas of intrigue, deception, tension, love, and loss".&lt;ref name="show director"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.gamespot.com/articles/quantum-break-tv-show-composer-talks-about-working/1100-6438668/ |title=Quantum Break TV Show Composer Talks About Working on His First Game |first=Eddie |last=Makuch |work=[[GameSpot]] |date=9 April 2016 |accessdate=30 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As Remedy encouraged [[YouTubers]] to make videos about the game and players to share their experience with others, the team introduced an audio option which allows players to turn off licensed music. This allows YouTubers to upload their videos online without having to worry about [[copyright infringement]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/269409/Remedy_listens_to_YouTubers_makes_Quantum_Breaks_licensed_jams_optional.php |title=Remedy listens to YouTubers, makes Quantum Break's licensed jams optional |first=Alex |last=Wawro |work=[[Gamasutra]] |date=31 March 2013 |accessdate=30 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The licensed music featured in the game was specially chosen by Lake, and is played at the end of each act and the credits scene.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.engadget.com/2016/03/29/quantum-break-stream-safe-music/ |title='Quantum Break' has an audio setting just for streamers |first=Timothy J. |last=Seppala |work=[[Joystiq]] |date=29 March 2016 |accessdate=30 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Release==
''Quantum Break'' was announced on 21 May 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/05/21/remedy-announces-new-title-quantum-break |title=Remedy Announces Quantum Break |first=Anthony |last=Gallegos |work=[[IGN]] |date=21 May 2013 |accessdate=30 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gameplay trailers were released at major conventions, including [[Electronic Entertainment Expo 2013]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/06/18/e3-2013-quantum-break-gives-you-control-of-games-and-tv |title=E3 2013: Quantum Break Gives You Control of Games And TV |first=Mitch |last=Dyer |work=[[IGN]] |date=18 June 2013 |accessdate=30 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Spike Video Game Awards|VGX]] Awards 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.videogamer.com/xboxone/quantum_break/news/quantum_break_gameplay_trailer_revealed_at_vgx.html |title=Quantum Break gameplay trailer revealed at VGX |first=David |last=Scammell |work=VideoGamer.com |date=30 June 2016 |accessdate=30 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Remedy released the first gameplay demo at Microsoft's conference at [[Gamescom 2014]], with Lake saying that the demo would make viewers "speechless".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-one-exclusive-quantum-break-will-leave-you-sp/1100-6421562/ |title=Xbox One-Exclusive Quantum Break Will "Leave You Speechless" |first=Eddie |last=Makuch |work=[[GameSpot]] |date=7 August 2014 |accessdate=30 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The game was originally set for release in 2015, but Microsoft held it to 2016 to avoid competition with other Xbox One exclusives including ''[[Halo 5: Guardians]]'', ''[[Rise of the Tomb Raider]]'', and ''[[Forza Motorsport 6]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://venturebeat.com/2015/04/02/quantum-break-delayed-to-2016-to-ease-xbox-ones-crowded-holiday/ |title=Quantum Break delayed to 2016 to ease Xbox One’s crowded holiday |first=Mike |last=Minotti |work=[[VentureBeat]] |date=2 April 2015| accessdate=30 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; incidentally giving Remedy more time to refine the game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-quantum-break-benefited-from-delay/1100-6436228/ |title=How Quantum Break Benefited From Delay |first=Mat |last=Paget |work=[[GameSpot]] |date=1 April 2016 |accessdate=30 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; At Gamescom 2016, Microsoft announced that the title would be released on 6 April 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.gamezone.com/news/xbox-one-exclusive-quantum-break-release-date-announced-3422657 |title=Xbox One exclusive Quantum Break release date announced |first=Mike |last=Boccher |work=GameZone |date=4 August 2015 |accessdate=30 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The show was released separately and was not available in the game's retail edition in an effort to save disc space.

Though ''Quantum Break'' was originally announced as a Xbox One exclusive, Microsoft announced in February 2016 that the game would be released for [[Windows 10]] ([[Universal Windows Platform]]) as well, to launch simultaneously with the Xbox One version. Developed internally by Remedy, the PC version would only be released on [[Windows Store]] and would require [[DirectX 12]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2016/02/microsoft-needs-to-stop-forcing-console-like-restrictions-on-windows-store-pc-games/ |title=Microsoft needs to stop forcing console-like restrictions on Windows Store PC games |last=Walton |first=Mark |work=[[Ars Technica]] |date=29 February 2016 |accessdate=2 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; This created a backlash among players, who criticized Microsoft for misleading them into buying a Xbox One by not revealing the PC version's existence when the game was announced. Microsoft's [[Phil Spencer (business executive)|Phil Spencer]] replied by saying that delivering a game to a broader audience "a good thing" and that it could increase the game's sales.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2016-02-12-not-everyones-thrilled-with-microsofts-quantum-break-pc-announcement |title=Not everyone's thrilled with Microsoft's Quantum Break PC announcement |first=Wesley |last=Yin-Poole |work=[[Eurogamer]] |date=12 February 2016 |accessdate=30 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lake added that he was "confused" and "baffled" by the responses of the community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.mcvuk.com/news/read/remedy-baffled-by-fanboy-fury-over-quantum-break-pc-release/0164875 |title=Remedy 'baffled' by fanboy fury over Quantum Break PC release |first=Alex |last=Calvin |work=[[Market for Home Computing and Video Games]] |date=1 April 2016 |accessdate=30 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2016-03-04-i-was-slightly-confused-by-the-reaction |title="I was slightly confused by the reaction" |first=Martin |last=Robinson |work=[[Eurogamer]] |date=4 March 2016 |accessdate=30 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Players who purchase the Xbox One version of the game would receive a digital code for the Windows 10 version. ''Alan Wake'', along with its two [[downloadable content|downloadable]] special episodes "The Signal" and "The Writer", as well as ''American Nightmare'', would be available for free for players who purchased the game through [[backward compatibility]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2016-02-11-quantum-break-is-coming-to-pc-too|title=Quantum Break is coming to PC, too|first=Wesley|last=Yin-Poole|work=[[Eurogamer]]|date=11 February 2016|accessdate=30 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Players who had not reached 18 years old by the game's release would get ''[[Kameo: Elements of Power]]'' as their pre-order bonus instead.{{efn |''Quantum Break'' is rated [[PEGI]] 16, and ''American Nightmare'' is rated PEGI 18.

Critical reception for ''Quantum Break'' was divided but generally positive, according to aggregator [[Metacritic]], with the Xbox One version receiving better reviews than the Windows version. Critics generally praised the game's graphics, gameplay and story, but had mixed opinions regarding the game's TV show and the choices featured in the game.

The game's graphics received critical acclaim, with Sam Loveridge from [[Digital Spy]] proclaiming it as one of the "best-looking" video games available for the [[Xbox One]].&lt;ref name="DSpy"/&gt; Critics also praised the game's detailed character models, which makes the game's characters look more lively. Some critics were impressed by the game's various particle effects and destruction mechanics, especially during the stutter moments, which were described as "impressive" by Peter Brown from [[GameSpot]],&lt;ref name="GSpotRev"/&gt; "gorgeous" by David Houghton from [[GamesRadar]],&lt;ref name="GRadarRev"/&gt; and "eye-popping" by Tristan Ogilvie from [[IGN]].&lt;ref name="IGNRev"/&gt; Matt Buchholtz from ''[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]'' thought that the locations featured in the game fit the game's atmosphere,&lt;ref name="EGMRev"/&gt; Peter Paras from [[Game Revolution]] criticized them for being too similar to each other.&lt;ref name="GameRevReview"/&gt;

The game's gameplay was positively reviewed, with Buchholtz describing it as one of the game's standout points&lt;ref name="EGMRev"/&gt; It was described it as "fun", "excellent" "exhilarating", "enjoyable" and "quick",&lt;ref name="EGMRev"/&gt;&lt;ref name="GRadarRev"/&gt;&lt;ref name="VGRev"/&gt; though Ogilvie, Paras and Dean Takahashi from [[VentureBeat]] considered it too easy for players and become repetitive.&lt;ref name="GameRevReview"/&gt;&lt;ref name="IGNRev"/&gt;&lt;ref name="VBRev"/&gt; Takahashi noted that the variety of time manipulation powers offered to players could be overwhelming, but as they progress, the experience offered is satisfying.&lt;ref name="VBRev"/&gt; Loveridge further added that these powers were addictive.&lt;ref name="DSpy"/&gt; Tom Orry from VideoGamer.com applauded these powers for being "cool" to use,&lt;ref name="VGRev"/&gt; and Ben Reeves from ''[[Game Informer]]'' praised them for adding variety to the game.&lt;ref name="GIRev"/&gt; As powers can be combined to form a chain of attacks, the game was praised for giving players freedom to explore and experiment with them.&lt;ref name="DestructRev"/&gt;&lt;ref name="GSpotRev"/&gt; Houghton complained that as most powers were available early on in the game, the development team missed the opportunity to fully "evolve" them.&lt;ref name="GRadarRev"/&gt; The cover system received negative opinions from critics, who complained that they sometimes got stuck in the cover during combat.&lt;ref name="DSpy"/&gt;&lt;ref name="PolyRev"/&gt; Brown and Stephen Totilo from [[Kotaku]] thought that the gunplay system was not as refined as the powers, and that the weapons featured were "generic".&lt;ref name="GSpotRev"/&gt;&lt;ref name="KotakuRev"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kotaku.com/quantum-break-the-kotaku-review-1768387991|title=Quantum Break: The Kotaku Review|first=Stephen|last=Totilo|work=[[Kotaku]]|date=5 April 2016|accessdate=17 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many critics lamented that the final boss character is too hard to defeat, leading to players' frustration.&lt;ref name="GIRev"/&gt;&lt;ref name="VBRev"/&gt; The [[Platform game|platforming]] section received mixed reviews. Orry and Arthur Gies from ''[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]]'' praised them for being "cool" to use and diluting the game's action,&lt;ref name="VGRev"/&gt;&lt;ref name="VBRev"/&gt; while Brown and Jeff Gerstmann from [[Giant Bomb]] described them as clumsy and ill-conceived due to the game's loose movement system.&lt;ref name="GSpotRev"/&gt;&lt;ref name="GBRev"/&gt;&lt;ref name="PCGRev"/&gt;

The game's story received a generally favourable reception. Brett Makedonski from [[Destructoid]] praised it as offering a very entertaining experience and engaging the player from start to finish,&lt;ref name="DestructRev"/&gt; while Takahashi thought that the narration was "ambitious".&lt;ref name="VBRev"/&gt; Orry further added that the story was very "complicated".&lt;ref name="VGRev"/&gt; The game's narrative objects were praised for providing players new insight on the game's story by Buchholtz,&lt;ref name="EGMRev"/&gt; though Houghton and Brown criticized that they broke the flow of gameplay and contain too much significant story information.&lt;ref name="GSpotRev"/&gt;&lt;ref name="GRadarRev"/&gt; Some critics believe that as the story progresses with the player's choices, it becomes easier to connect emotionally with the characters. The choices were thought to be important, weighty, and significant, and many claimed that they add replayability to the game&lt;ref name="DSpy"/&gt;&lt;ref name="IGNRev"/&gt; and more control to players.&lt;ref name="VBRev"/&gt; Gies  added that this approach to choice is new and unique to this game.&lt;ref name="PolyRev"/&gt; However, some critics were disappointed that these choices do not alter the outcome of the story.&lt;ref name="GIRev"/&gt;&lt;ref name="GSpotRev"/&gt;

The TV portion of the game received a generally positive reception. Andy Kelly from ''[[PC Gamer]]'' noted its high production values&lt;ref name="PCGRev"/&gt; and Takahashi, Gies and Ogilvie praised the performance of the actors,&lt;ref name="IGNRev"/&gt;&lt;ref name="VBRev"/&gt; with Gies singling out Gillen and Reddick as Paul Serene and Martin Hatch respectively.&lt;ref name="PolyRev"/&gt; The perspective offered in the TV series was applauded by Houghton, Loveridge, and Ogilvie for successfully filling many gaps in the story and added additional depth to the game's characters,&lt;ref name="DSpy"/&gt;&lt;ref name="GRadarRev"/&gt;&lt;ref name="IGNRev"/&gt; as well as humanizing the game's villains according to Gies and Kelly.&lt;ref name="PCGRev"/&gt;&lt;ref name="PolyRev"/&gt; Other critics held a completely different opinion, with Paras saying that the show is mediocre and far below the industry's standard, criticizing it for being irrelevant.&lt;ref name="GameRevReview"/&gt; Reeves felt that the show was unnecessary, since the TV characters rarely show up in the game.&lt;ref name="GIRev"/&gt; Both Orry and Buchholtz criticized the show for disconnecting the player from the game, and that the time spent on working on the TV show could have been saved by using in-engine [[cutscene]]s.&lt;ref name="EGMRev"/&gt;&lt;ref name="VGRev"/&gt; Peter Brown from [[GameSpot]] criticized the show's dialogue, calling them "cheesy", and obvious product placement. The show's costuming is eccentric, and some critics complained of excessive reuse of props throughout the four episodes.&lt;ref name="GSpotRev"/&gt;

Critics had mixed opinions regarding the overall package. Timothy J. Seppala from ''[[Engadget]]'' considered it "a legitimate reason to buy an Xbox One",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= https://www.engadget.com/2016/04/07/quantum-break-is-a-legitimate-reason-to-buy-an-xbox-one/ |title='Quantum Break' is a legitimate reason to buy an Xbox One |first=Timothy |last=J. Seppala |work=[[Engadget]] |date=4 July 2016 |accessdate=1 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Loveridge and Gies thought that Remedy had set a foundation for future storytelling by blending the two mediums together, making this game a unique title.&lt;ref name="DSpy"/&gt;&lt;ref name="PolyRev"/&gt; Reeves thought that the game had the best gameplay and storytelling of all other Remedy games.&lt;ref name="GIRev"/&gt; Totilo added that the game innovates with the TV show, and that it makes the title something "extraordinary".&lt;ref name="KotakuRev"/&gt; Martin Robinson from [[Eurogamer]] concluded that the game has more style than substance, but recognized the title's uniqueness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2016-04-01-quantum-break-review |title=Quantum Break review 
|first=Martin |last=Robinson |work=[[Eurogamer]] |date=1 April 2016 |accessdate=1 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both Houghton and Gerstmann agreed that it is an ambitious project,&lt;ref name="GRadarRev"/&gt; However, Gerstmann was disappointed that the elements did not connect well enough&lt;ref name="GBRev"/&gt; and Houghton felt that the complicated format dragged down the game as they were never combined together cohesively.&lt;ref name="GRadarRev"/&gt;

The PC version was poorly received due to numerous performance and stability issues, mostly on [[Nvidia]] [[GPU]]s,&lt;ref name="Hamilton"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.gamespot.com/articles/quantum-break-on-pc-cant-run-at-60-fps-doesnt-have/1100-6438677/ |title=Quantum Break on PC Can't Run at 60 FPS, Doesn't Have Quit Button |last=Hamilton |first=Kirk |date=8 April 2016 |work=[[GameSpot]] |accessdate=9 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; along with restrictions imposed by the [[Universal Windows Platform]] that keep users from resorting to third-party workarounds.&lt;ref name="Linneman"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/digitalfoundry-2016-what-went-wrong-with-quantum-break-pc |title=What went wrong with Quantum Break on PC? |last=Linneman |first=John |date=8 April 2016 |work=[[Eurogamer]] |accessdate=9 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Remedy later announced that they were working actively to fix the issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.polygon.com/2016/4/13/11420482/quantum-break-pc-problems-framerate-crashes |title=Studio acknowledges big problems in Quantum Break on PC, says fixes are on the way |first=Owen S. |last=Good |work=[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]] |date=13 April 2016 |accessdate=1 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; A Steam release was announced, and this version is compatible with [[Windows 7]] or higher.

===Sales===
According to Aaron Greenberg, an executive at Microsoft, the pre-order sales had exceeded their expectation, and the title has the potential to become a massive success.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.vg247.com/2016/04/01/quantum-break-pre-orders-strong-game-could-be-mega-hit/ |title=Quantum Break pre-orders "really strong", could be a "mega hit," says Greenberg |first=Sherif |last=Saed |work=[[VG247]] |date=1 April 2016 |accessdate=1 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  ''Quantum Break'' was the best-selling retail game in its first week of release in the UK, outselling competitor ''[[Dirt Rally]]'' by 139 sales. It was also the best-selling original property released by Microsoft since the release of Xbox One, outselling games like ''[[Sunset Overdrive]]'', ''[[Ori and the Blind Forest]]'' and ''[[Ryse: Son of Rome]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2016-04-11-quantum-break-uks-best-selling-boxed-game |title=Quantum Break UK's best-selling boxed game |first=Wesley |last=Yin-Poole |work=[[Eurogamer]] |date=11 April 2016 |accessdate=11 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Theatre of Ancient Greece]] and [[classical drama]], the '''''skene''''' was the structure at the back of a theatre stage.The word skene means "tent" or "hut," and it is thought that the original structure for these purposes was a tent or light building of wood, and was a [[temporary structure]].&lt;ref&gt;Broadman, 168&lt;/ref&gt; It was initially a very light structure or just cloth hanging from a rope, but over the course of time the skene underwent fundamental changes. First it became a permanent building, whose roof could sometimes be used to make speeches and as time passed it was raised up from the level of the orchestra, creating a proskenion, or "space in front of the ''skene''".  The facade of the proskenion was behind the orchestra, and provided a space for supporting stage scenery. During the Roman Period the skene had become a large and complex, elaborately decorated, stone building on several levels. Actors emerged from the skene and could use its steps and balconies to speak from.  It was also where costumes were stored and to which the [[periaktoi]] (painted panels serving as the background) were connected.&lt;ref&gt;Perseus&lt;/ref&gt;
== Classical Greece ==
Ancient Greek theatre began in the 6th century B.C. and traces its origins to religious rituals such as the Festival of Dionysus and choral odes to the gods known as dithyrambs. Early Greek theaters were simple open air structures built on the slope of a hill. The Theatre of Dionysus Eleuthereus in Athens is thought to have been the first purpose-built theatre. Around the middle of the 5th century B.C. the skene began to appear in Greek Theatre. Placing a skene behind the ''orchestra'' where the performers acted, played, and danced broke what is thought to have been the original [[theatre in the round]] nature of Greek theatre.  The skene also served as another "hidden stage." At times some of the action went on inside, in which case it was up to the audience to decide what was happening based on the noises coming from the inside.  It was a convention of the dramas of the classic period that characters never died on stage, instead usually retreating into the skene to do so.

"At some point at Athens in the classical period a small stoa colonnade was constructed behind the scene-building with its back to the theater and would have provided a permanent backdrop for the action."&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=A Guide to Ancient Greek Drama|last=Storey|first=Ian|publisher=Blackwell Publishing|year=2005|isbn=|location=Malden, MA|pages=39}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Hellenistic Period ==
The Hellenistic period started around the time of Alexander the Great's death in 323 B.C. and lasted until the Roman Victory at the Battle of Actium in 31 B.C. As Ancient Greece began to change from a culture consisting of ethnic and city-state Greeks to one governed by large monarchies, theatre architecture to include the stage buildings began to experience significant changes. In the 4th century B.C. the Skene became a permanent stone structure and the stage was raised off the ground. In surviving examples this stage seems to have been raised by 2.43 m to 3.96 m above the orchestra, and to have been from 1.92 m to 3.96 m deep, terminated by the skene.&lt;ref&gt;Grove&lt;/ref&gt; As the [[Greek chorus]] declined in importance compared to a smaller group of main actors, the chorus remained in the orchestra to perform, while the main actors generally performed from the stage on top of the proskenion. This important change occurred in the [[Hellenistic period]], between the 3rd and 1st century BC.  The skene itself became increasingly elaborate, and was also available as a place for actors to declaim from, so that the performers between them had three levels available. "The roof of the skene was called the ''theologian'' ("god-speaking"), from which one might assume that its primary use was for the advent of deities, either at the start or close of the drama."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Most theaters still standing today date from the Hellenistic period.   

== Roman Period ==
In [[Roman theatre (structure)|Roman theatres]], [[scaenae frons]] ("facade of the skene") is the term for the elaborately decorated stone screens, rising two or three stories, that the skene had now become. By the 1st century BC, the skene was as elaborate as its Roman development which dispensed with the orchestra altogether, leaving a relatively low ''proscaenium'' facade, often decorated, and a wide stage or ''pulpitum'' behind, ending in an elaborate scaenae frons with three or more doors, and sometimes three stories.  The evolution of the [[actor]], who assumed an individual part and answered to the chorus (the word for actor, hypokrites, means answerer), introduced into drama a new form, the alternation of acted scenes, or [[episode]]s. The skene no longer supported painted sets in the Greek manner but relied for effect on elaborate permanent architectural decoration and consisted of a series of complex stone buildings. To each side there was a ''paraskenion''.  The ''episkenion'' was the upper floor of the skene, which might be deepened to give a third stage level, seen through ''thyromata'' or openings.  The interior of the ''logeion'' ("building") behind the skene facade remained normally outside the view of the audience, and fulfilled the original function as a changing room and place for props.

 |ShortSummary = Opening around five years before the arrival of Spartacus, Batiatus finds himself administering his father's [[Gladiator#Schools and training|ludus]], while his father is in [[Sicilia]] living in semi-retirement. Seeking fame, he (with the support of his old friend Solonius) tries to win favor with a local nobleman, Tullius, by paying 50 dinars for a Gallic slave worth only 10 named Crixus - by noting his potential to be a great fighter. Arriving at the ludus, Crixus soon meets veteran gladiator Oenomaus (who has a slave wife named Melitta), as well as Syrian slave recruits Ashur and Dagan. Meanwhile, Lucretia welcomes the sudden return to Capua of Gaia, a young but recently widowed friend, and "party girl" from Rome who is attracted to both the delights of the ludus and of opium. In an attempt to participate in the opening games of the soon to be completed arena, Batiatus selects his most skilled gladiator, Gannicus the Celt, the original champion of the House of Batiatus, for a duel in the marketplace. Unknown to Batiatus, however, is that young Vettius, the owner of a rival ludus, is merely an agent of Tullius -- leading to deadly consequences as he is soon outmaneuvered in his own game. Tullius wishes to purchase Gannicus and when Batiatus refuses the offer, he is savagely beaten.

 |ShortSummary = A week has now passed since the murder of his bodyguard and severe beating at the hands of Tullius' men and Batiatus continues to recover. Tullius sends him a message, via Batiatus' good friend Solonius, and offers to double his offer for Gannicus to 400. Batiatus is in no mood to compromise, however, and soon plans his own revenge on Vettius with the aid of the Syrians. Quintillius Varis comes to Capua to select gladiators for his games, but Gaia and Lucretia seemingly bump into him, and offer to have him wait at Batiatus' house -- where Batiatus will seemingly act surprised, but then offer his ludus' services instead. Meanwhile, Doctore is irked when Batiatus criticizes him as his father's man, and names Oenomaus to succeed him. Shamed, he suddenly challenges Oenomaus to a duel, in which Oenomaus eventually kills him and becomes the new Doctore. Meanwhile, inside the ludus, Gannicus (victorious from his bout with Crixus) and Melitta are ordered to have sex for Varis' entertainment, leaving both of them troubled, but with Batiatus succeeding in securing the position of primus for Gannicus in the upcoming games.

 |ShortSummary = Batiatus is pleased with himself for having arranged Varis' primus. He and the household are not, however, prepared for the sudden return of the [[lanista]] and [[pater familias]], his father, Titus, who treats his son's caretaking skills with disdain. He laughs when he hears that Gannicus will represent the house in the games, and sets out to make amends with Tullius, thereby undermining most of the younger Batiatus' schemes. Titus manages to mend relations with Tullius and follows his terms, to pit his own men against each other in some more honorable afternoon games. While father and son are away, Varis returns to the Batiatus home with a friend, Cossutius, expecting to again experience the pleasures of his previous visit, this time with one of the virgin slave women - Diona. In the arena, Barca's lover Auctus and newcomer Crixus, duel in the arena and the lesser experienced Crixus manages to kill him, thereby earning the mark of the brotherhood. Surprised by his son's newfound gladiator, the father sees some merit in his son's plans and abilities after all, and decides never to leave the ludus again - much to his son's chagrin.

 |ShortSummary = The tensions between the younger and the elder Batiatus continue, particularly in the old arena where the elder continually reminds his son of his place and station. At home, the Roman women are also having difficulty accepting the father's ongoing - and seemingly permanent - presence. When Gaia meets an acquaintance at the market, she introduces him to Lucretia and he immediately comments on the pleasures available at her home. Gaia again sees an opportunity, but the elder Batiatus would never condone such debauchery. His son, however, manages to convince him to leave for [[Naples|Neapolis]], ostensibly to purchase new slaves and receive the salt air. Lucretia agrees to proceed, with Solonius as chaperone, and the night seems to go well, until the unexpected arrival of Tullius, who wishes to fight Gannicus - a duel the gladiator is ordered to lose. Recovering from his wounds, Gannicus is, however, able to share an intimate moment with Melitta. During their liaison, Gaia underestimates Tullius and she dies at his hand. The sudden return of the Batiatus' father simply make matters worse yet again, particularly for Lucretia.

In responding to his father's ultimatum that he choose between his home and his wife, Batiatus attempts to gain time is not appreciated by Lucretia who believes she would have him leave. She also has her own solution to her husband's desire for a son - via a liaison with Gallic virility in the form of Crixus. Meanwhile, Titus announces a tournament to determine the worth of the new men that make up half his stable of gladiators, with the losers to be sent to the mines. Tullius again visits the ludus, still seeking Gannicus while offering preferential matches in the new arena. Meanwhile, Melitta and Gannicus increasingly desire after one another, but Gannicus, sensing despair, deliberately lowers his guard allowing Crixus to win and sealing his sale to Tullius. Titus, weakened and now bedridden by the ongoing poisonings of Lucretia, finds himself at her mercy when the others leave seeking medicine. He is finally silenced by the honeyed-wine given to him by Tullius but poisoned by her - and, perhaps deliberately, so is Melitta. Quintus and Doctore return, and begin to mourn the dead.

|ShortSummary = Batiatus now seeks vengeance against Tullius for all that has befallen him, including the death of his father. Gannicus pushes Batiatus to complete his sale to Tullius so that he may seek revenge for the House of Batiatus by killing Tullius himself, but Solonius counsels caution and a more sensible, if final, solution. Meanwhile, Naevia replaces Melitta as the personal body-slave to Lucretia, who promises her that no man will ever touch her as happened to Diona. In the end, Tullius and Vettius both fall into the trap - Tullius is bricked into the foundations of the new arena, and at the opening of the new Capua arena, Vettius informs of the sale of his ludus to Solonius and departs for Antioch. Batiatus now has a new rival, his former friend whom he has distanced by his continual rebukes, and one willing to use his own methods against him. The opening games begin with the execution of captured fugitives (including Diona), and after winning the final mass night-battle of the opening ceremony, Gannicus (at Solonius' suggestion) receives his freedom from the magistrate. He soon departs the ludus - but not before entrusting his champion necklace to Crixus.

{{Technical|date=August 2016}}
A '''speech act''' in [[linguistics]] and the [[philosophy of language]] is an utterance that has [[performativity|performative function]] in language and communication. 
According to [[Kent Bach]], "almost any speech act is really the performance of several acts at once, distinguished by different aspects of the speaker's intention: there is the act of saying something, what one does in saying it, such as requesting or promising, and how one is trying to affect one's audience".
The contemporary use of the term goes back to [[J. L. Austin]]'s development of [[performative utterance]]s and his theory of [[Locutionary act|locutionary]], [[Illocutionary act|illocutionary]], and [[perlocutionary act]]s. Speech acts are commonly taken to include such acts as promising, ordering, greeting, warning, inviting and congratulating.

==Locutionary, illocutionary and perlocutionary acts==
Speech acts can be analysed on three levels: 
# A [[locutionary act]], the performance of an utterance: the actual utterance and its ostensible meaning, comprising phonetic, phatic and rhetic acts corresponding to the verbal, syntactic and semantic aspects of any meaningful utterance; 
# an [[illocutionary act]]: the pragmatic 'illocutionary force' of the utterance, thus its intended significance as a socially valid verbal action (see below); 
# and in certain cases a further [[perlocutionary act]]: its actual effect, such as persuading, convincing, scaring, enlightening, inspiring, or otherwise getting someone to do or realize something, whether intended or not (Austin 1962)

==Illocutionary acts==
The concept of an [[illocutionary act]] is central to the concept of a speech act. Although there are numerous opinions regarding how to define 'illocutionary acts', there are some kinds of acts which are widely accepted as illocutionary, as for example promising or commanding.

Following the usage of, for example, [[John R. Searle]], "speech act" is often meant to refer just to the same thing as the term [[illocutionary act]], which [[John L. Austin]] had originally introduced in ''[[How to Do Things with Words]]'' (published posthumously in 1962).  Searle's work on speech acts is also commonly understood to refine Austin's conception. However, some philosophers have pointed out a significant difference between the two conceptions: whereas Austin emphasized the conventional interpretation of speech acts, Searle emphasized a psychological interpretation (based on beliefs, intentions, etc.).&lt;ref&gt;Sbisa, Marina, "How to read Austin", in ''Pragmatics'', 17:3 (2007), p. 461-73.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bruno Ambroise, From Speech Act Theory to Pragmatics: The loss of the illocutionary point. (= Pragmatics today) [http://halshs.archives-ouvertes.fr/docs/00/51/48/10/PDF/From_speech_acts_theory_to_pragmatics_-_Bologna.pdf].&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Austin's preliminary informal description, the idea of an "illocutionary act" can be captured by emphasizing that "by saying something, we ''do'' something", as when someone issues an order to someone to go by saying "Go!", or when a minister joins two people in marriage saying, "I now pronounce you husband and wife." (Austin would eventually define the "[[illocutionary act]]" in a more exact manner.)

An interesting type of illocutionary speech act is that performed in the utterance of what Austin calls [[performative utterance|performative]]s, typical instances of which are "I nominate John to be President", "I sentence you to ten years' imprisonment", or "I promise to pay you back." In these typical, rather explicit cases of performative sentences, the action that the sentence describes (nominating, sentencing, promising) is performed by the utterance of the sentence itself.

== Perlocutionary acts ==
While illocutionary acts relate more to the speaker, perlocutionary acts are centered around the listener. Perlocutionary acts always have a 'perlocutionary effect' which is the effect a speech act has on a listener. This could affect the listener's thoughts, emotions or even their physical actions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Blackwell Textbook In Linguistics|last=Birner|first=Betty J.|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|year=2013|isbn=|location=|pages=187}}&lt;/ref&gt; An example of this could be if someone uttered the sentence "I'm hungry." The perlocutionary effect on the listener would persuade them to maybe make a sandwich for the speaker.

==Indirect speech acts==
In the course of performing speech acts we ordinarily communicate with each other. The content of communication may be identical, or almost identical, with the content intended to be communicated, as when a stranger asks, "What is your name?"

However, the meaning of the linguistic means used (if ever there are linguistic means, for at least some so-called "speech acts" can be performed non-verbally) may also be different from the content intended to be communicated. One may, in appropriate circumstances, request Peter to do the dishes by just saying, "Peter ...!", or one can promise to do the dishes by saying, "Me!" One common way of performing speech acts is to use an expression which indicates one speech act, and indeed performs this act, but also performs a further speech act, which is indirect. One may, for instance, say, "Peter, can you close the window?", thereby asking Peter whether he will be able to close the window, but also requesting that he does so. Since the request is performed indirectly, by means of (directly) performing a question, it counts as an indirect speech act.

An even more indirect way of making such a request would be to say, in Peter's presence in the room with the open window, "I'm cold." The speaker of this request must rely upon Peter's understanding of several items of in-explicit information: that the window is open and is the cause of her being cold, that being cold is an uncomfortable sensation and she wishes it to be taken care of, and that Peter cares to rectify this situation by closing the window. This, of course, depends much on the relationship between the requester and Peter—he might understand the request differently if she were his boss at work than if she were his girlfriend at home. The more presumed information pertaining to the request, the more indirect the speech act may be considered to be.

Indirect speech acts are commonly used to reject proposals and to make requests. For example, a speaker asks, "Would you like to meet me for coffee?" and another replies, "I have class." The second speaker used an indirect speech act to reject the proposal. This is indirect because the literal meaning of "I have class" does not [[logical consequence|entail]] any sort of rejection.

This poses a problem for [[linguists]] because it is confusing (on a rather simple approach) to see how the person who made the proposal can understand that his proposal was rejected. Following substantially an account of [[H. P. Grice]], Searle suggests that we are able to derive meaning out of indirect speech acts by means of a cooperative process out of which we are able to derive multiple illocutions; however, the process he proposes does not seem to accurately solve the problem. [[Sociolinguistics]] has studied the social dimensions of conversations. This discipline considers the various contexts in which speech acts occur.

In other words this means that one does not need to say the words apologize, pledge, or praise in order to show they are doing the action. All the examples above show how the actions and indirect words make something happen rather than coming out straightforward with specific words and saying it.

==History==
For much of the history of linguistics and the [[positivist]] philosophy of language, language was viewed primarily as a way of making factual assertions, and the other uses of language tended to be ignored, as Austin states at the beginning of Lecture 1, "It was for too long the assumption of philosophers that the business of a 'statement' can only be to 'describe' some state of affairs, or to 'state some fact', which it must do either truly or falsely."&lt;ref&gt;Austin, J. L. 1962. How to do things with words. London: Oxford University Press, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ludwig Wittgenstein|Wittgenstein]] came up with the idea of "don't ask for the meaning, ask for the use," showing language as a new vehicle for social activity.&lt;ref&gt;Bach, Kent. "Speech Acts." Speech Acts. Routledge Encyclopedia of Philosophy, n.d. Web. 10 Feb. 2014&lt;/ref&gt; Speech act theory hails from Wittgenstein’s philosophical theories.  Wittgenstein believed meaning derives from pragmatic tradition, demonstrating the importance of how language is used to accomplish objectives within specific situations.  By following rules to accomplish a goal, communication becomes a set of language games. Thus, utterances do more than reflect a meaning, they are words designed to get things done.&lt;ref&gt;Littlejohn, S. (2009). Speech act theory. In S. Littlejohn, &amp; K. Foss (Eds.), Encyclopedia of communication theory. (pp. 919-921). Thousand Oaks, CA: SAGE Publications, Inc. {{DOI|10.4135/9781412959384.n356}}&lt;/ref&gt; The work of [[J. L. Austin]], particularly his ''How to Do Things with Words'', led philosophers to pay more attention to the non-declarative uses of language. The terminology he introduced, especially the notions "[[locutionary act]]", "[[illocutionary act]]", and "[[perlocutionary act]]", occupied an important role in what was then to become the "study of speech acts". All of these three acts, but especially the "illocutionary act", are nowadays commonly classified as "speech acts".

Austin was by no means the first one to deal with what one could call "speech acts" in a wider sense. The term 'social act' and some of the theory of this ''[[sui generis]]'' type of linguistic action are to be found in the fifth of [[Thomas Reid]]'s Essays on the Active Powers of the Human Mind (1788, chapter VI, Of the Nature of a Contract).
"A man may see, and hear, and remember, and judge, and reason; he may deliberate and form purposes, and execute them, without the intervention of any other intelligent being. They are solitary acts. But when he asks a question for information, when he testifies a fact, when he gives a command to his servant, when he makes a promise, or enters into a contract, these are social acts of mind, and can have no existence without the intervention of some other intelligent being, who acts a part in them. Between the operations of the mind, which, for want of a more proper name, I have called solitary, and those I have called social, there is this very remarkable distinction, that, in the solitary, the expression of them by words, or any other sensible sign, is accidental. They may exist, and be complete, without being expressed, without being known to any other person. But, in the social operations, the expression is essential. They cannot exist without being expressed by words or signs, and known to the other party."&lt;ref&gt;Mulligan, K. ''Promisings and other social acts - their constituents and structure.'' in Mulligan, K., editor ''Speech Act and Sachverhalt: Reinach and the Foundations of Realist Phenomenology''. Nijhoff, Dordrecht/Boston/Lancaster 1987. Quote from Reid 1969, 437-438)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Schuhmann | first1 = Karl | last2 = Smith | first2 = Barry | year = 1990 | title = Elements of Speech Act Theory in the Work of Thomas Reid | url = | journal = History of Philosophy Quarterly | volume = 7 | issue = | pages = 47–66 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Brock | first1 = Jarrett | year = 1981 | title = An Introduction to [[Charles Sanders Peirce|Peirce]]'s Theory of Speech Acts | url = | journal = Transactions of the Charles S.

[[Adolf Reinach]] (1883–1917)&lt;ref&gt;Mulligan, K. ''Promisings and other social acts - their constituents and structure.'' in Mulligan, K., editor ''Speech Act and Sachverhalt: Reinach and the Foundations of Realist Phenomenology''. Nijhoff, Dordrecht/Boston/Lancaster 1987.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Stanislav Škrabec]] (1844–1918){{Citation needed|date=March 2013}} have been both independently credited with a fairly comprehensive account of social acts as performative utterances dating to 1913, long before Austin and Searle. 

The term "Speech Act" had also been already used by [[Karl Bühler]].&lt;ref&gt;"Die Axiomatik der Sprachwissenschaften”, ''Kant-Studien'' 38 (1933), 43, where he discusses a ''Theorie der Sprechhandlungen''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Sprachtheorie'' (Jena: Fischer, 1934) where he uses "''Sprechhandlung''" and "''Theorie der Sprechakte''"&lt;/ref&gt;

The term [[metalocutionary act]] has also been used to indicate a speech act that refers to the forms and functions of the discourse itself rather than continuing the substantive development of the discourse, or to the configurational functions of [[Prosody (linguistics)|prosody]] and [[punctuation]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2013}}

==In language development==
Dore (1975) proposed that children's utterances were realizations of one of nine primitive speech acts:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dore|first=John|date=1975|title=Holophrases, Speech Acts and Language Universals|url=https://search-proquest-com.ezproxy.uta.edu/llba/docview/85490541/8DB33390F414459PQ/2?accountid=7117|journal=Journal of Child Language|volume=2|pages=|via=LLBA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Formalization==

There is no agreed formalization of Speech Act theory. A first attempt to give some grounds of an illocutionary logic has been given by [[John Searle]] and D. Vandervecken 1985.&lt;ref&gt;Searle, J.R., Vandervecken, D.: Foundations of Illocutionary Logic. Cambridge University Press: Cambridge 1985&lt;/ref&gt; Other attempts have been proposed by [[Per Martin-Löf]]  for a treatment of the concept of assertion inside intuitionistic type theory, and by [[Carlo Dalla Pozza]], with a proposal of a formal pragmatics connecting propositional content (given with classical semantics) and illocutionary force (given by intuitionistic semantics). Up to now the main basic formal application of speech act theory are to be found in the field of human-computer interaction (in chatboxes and other tools: see below).

==In computer science==

[[Computational speech act model]]s of [[Human–computer interaction|human–computer conversation]] have been developed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference|location=Hartford, CT|conference=Bioengineering Conference, 1991., Proceedings of the 1991 IEEE Seventeenth Annual Northeast|pages=263–264|url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/Xplore/login.jsp?url=/iel2/549/4024/00154675.pdf?isnumber=4024&amp;prod=CNF&amp;arnumber=154675&amp;arSt=263&amp;ared=264&amp;arAuthor=Morelli%2C+R.A.%3B+Bronzino%2C+J.D.%3B+Goethe%2C+J.W.|title=A computational speech-act model of human-computer conversations|author1=R. A. Morelli|author2= J. D. Bronzino |author3=J. W. Goethe|doi=10.1109/NEBC.1991.154675|year=1991}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Speech act theory has been used to model [[conversation]]s for automated classification and retrieval.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference|url=http://www.scils.rutgers.edu/~aakhus/lap/Twitchell%20et%20al%20-%20SAT%20for%20classification.pdf|title=Using Speech Act Theory to Model Conversations for Automated Classification and Retrieval|author1=Douglas P. Twitchell|author2=Mark Adkins|author3=Jay F. Nunamaker Jr.|author4=Judee K. Burgoon|conference=Proceedings of the 9th International Working Conference on the Language-Action Perspective on Communication Modelling (LAP 2004) |year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another highly-influential view of Speech Acts has been in the 'Conversation for Action' developed by [[Terry Winograd]] and [[Fernando Flores]] in their 1987 text "Understanding Computers and Cognition: A New Foundation for Design". Arguably the most important part of their analysis lies in a state-transition diagram (in Chapter 5) that Winograd and Flores claim underlies the significant illocutionary (speech act) claims of two parties attempting to coordinate action with one another (no matter whether the agents involved might be human–human, human–computer, or computer–computer).

A key part of this analysis is the contention that one dimension of the social domain-tracking the illocutionary status of the transaction (whether individual participants claim that their interests have been met, or not) is very readily conferred to a computer process, regardless of whether the computer has the means to adequately represent the real world issues underlying that claim. Thus a computer instantiating the 'conversation for action' has the useful ability to model the status of the current social reality independent of any external reality on which social claims may be based.

This transactional view of speech acts has significant applications in many areas in which (human) individuals have had different roles—for instance, a patient and a physician might meet in an encounter in which the patient makes a request for treatment, the physician responds with a counter-offer involving a treatment she feels is appropriate, and the patient might respond, etc. Such a "Conversation for Action" can describe a situation in which an external observer (such as a computer or health information system) may be able to track the ILLOCUTIONARY (or Speech Act) STATUS of negotiations between the patient and physician participants even in the absence of any adequate model of the illness or proposed treatments. The key insight provided by Winograd and Flores is that the state-transition diagram representing the SOCIAL (Illocutionary) negotiation of the two parties involved is generally much, much simpler than any model representing the world in which those parties are making claims; in short, the system tracking the status of the 'conversation for action' need not be concerned with modeling all of the realities of the external world. A conversation for action is critically dependent upon certain stereotypical CLAIMS about the status of the world made by the two parties. Thus a "Conversation for Action" can be readily tracked and facilitated by a device with little or no ability to model circumstances in the real world other than the ability to register claims by specific agents about a domain.

=== Uses in technology ===

In making useful ''applications'' of technology to domains such as healthcare, it is helpful to discriminate between problems which are very, very hard (such as deep understanding of pathophysiology as it relates to genetic and various environmental influences) and problem which are relatively easier, such as following the status of negotiations between a patient and a health care provider. Speech Act (Illocutionary) Analysis allows for a useful understanding of the status of a negotiation between (for instance) a health care provider and a patient INDEPENDENT of any well-accepted credible and comprehensive understanding of a disease process as it might apply to that patient. For this reason, systems which track the status of PROMISES and REJECTED-PROPOSALS and ACCEPTED-PROMISES can help us to understand the situations in which (human or computer) AGENTS find themselves as they attempt to fulfill ROLES involving other agents, and such systems can facilitate both human and human–computer systems in achieving role-associated goals.

===Rules===
In the past, philosophy has discussed rules for when expressions are used. The two rules are ''constitutive'' and ''regulative rules''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Searle|first1=John|title=What is a Speech Act?|url=https://faculty.unlv.edu/jwood/unlv/Articles/SearleWhatIsASpeechAct.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of [[John_Searle#Speech_acts|constitutive rules]] finds its origin in [[Wittgenstein]] and [[John Rawls|Rawls]],&lt;ref&gt;John Rawls: ''Two Concepts of Rules'' (1955)&lt;/ref&gt; and has been elaborated by [[G.C.J. Midgley]],&lt;ref&gt;G.C.J. Midgley: ''Linguistic Rules'' (1959)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Max Black]],&lt;ref&gt;Max Black: ''Models and Metaphors'' (1962)&lt;/ref&gt; [[G.H. von Wright]],&lt;ref&gt;G.H. von Wright: ''Norm and Action'' (1963)&lt;/ref&gt; [[David Shwayder]],&lt;ref&gt;David Schwayder: ''The Stratification of Behaviour'' (1965)&lt;/ref&gt; and [[John Searle]].&lt;ref&gt;Searle: ''Speech Acts'' (1969)&lt;/ref&gt;

Whereas ''regulative rules'' are prescriptions that regulate a pre-existing activity (whose existence is logically independent of the rules), ''constitutive rules'' constitute an activity the existence of which is logically dependent on the rules.

For example: traffic rules are ''regulative rules'' that prescribe certain behaviour in order to regulate the traffic. Without these rules however, the traffic would not cease to be. In contrast: the rules of chess are ''constitutive rules'' that constitute the game. Without these rules chess would not exist, since the game is logically dependent on the rules. &lt;ref&gt;Kathrin Glüer and Peter Pagin: ''Rules of Meaning and Practical Reasoning'' (1998)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== In multiagent universes ===

Multi-agent systems sometimes use speech act labels to express the intent of an agent when it sends a message to another agent. For example the intent "inform" in the message "inform(content)" may be interpreted as a request that the receiving agent adds the item "content" to its knowledge-base; this is in contrast to the message "query(content)" which may be interpreted (depending on the semantics employed) as a request to see if the item content is currently in the receiving agents knowledge base. There are at least two standardisations of speech act labelled messaging [[KQML]] and [[FIPA]].

KQML and FIPA are based on the Searlian, that is, psychological semantics of speech acts. [[Munindar P. Singh]] has long advocated moving away from the psychological to a social semantics of speech acts—one that would be in tune with Austin's conception.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Social and Psychological Commitments in Multiagent Systems|url=http://www.csc.ncsu.edu/faculty/mpsingh/papers/mas/fall-symp-91-longer.pdf|accessdate=24 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Andrew Jones&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dcs.kcl.ac.uk/staff/ajijones/ Andrew J. I. Jones]&lt;/ref&gt; has also been a critic of the psychological conception. A recent collection of manifestos by researchers in agent communication reflects a growing recognition in the multiagent systems community of the benefits of a social semantics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Research Directions in Agent Communication|url=http://www.csc.ncsu.edu/faculty/mpsingh/papers/mas/TIST-13-AC-manifestos.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In political science==
In political science, the Copenhagen School adopts speech act as a form of felicitous speech act (or simply 'facilitating conditions'), whereby the speaker, often politicians or players, act in accordance to the truth but in preparation for the audience to take action in the directions of the player that are driven or incited by the act. This forms an observable framework under a specified subject matter from the player, and the audience who are 'under-theorised [would] remain outside of the framework itself, and would benefit from being both brought in and drawn out.'&lt;ref&gt;[http://wrap.warwick.ac.uk/1232/1/WRAP_McDonald_0671572-pais-270709-mcdonald_securitisation_and_construction_of_security_ejir_forthcoming_2008.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; It is because the audience would not be informed of the intentions of the player, except to focus on the display of the speech act itself. Therefore, in the perspective of the player, the truth of the subject matter is irrelevant except the result produced via the audience.&lt;ref&gt;''Barry Buzan, Ole Waever and Jaap de Wilde'' (1998) where he discussed the lens of perseption in speech act''&lt;/ref&gt;

The study of Speech Acts is prevalent in legal theory since laws themselves can be interpreted as speech acts. Laws issue out a command to their constituents which can be realized as an action. When forming a legal contract, speech acts can be made when people are making or accepting an offer.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://lsolum.typepad.com/legaltheory/2012/03/legal-theory-lexicon-speech-acts.html|title=Legal Theory Lexicon: Speech Acts|website=Legal Theory Blog|access-date=2018-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Considering the theory of freedom of speech, some speech acts may not be legally protected. For example, a death threat is a type of speech act and is considered to exist outside of the protection of freedom of speech as it is treated as a criminal act.

==In finance==
In finance, it is possible to understand mathematical models as speech acts: the notion of "financial Logos"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.ribaf.2016.01.022 |title=The financial Logos : The framing of financial decision-making by mathematical modelling |journal=Research in International Business and Finance |volume=37 |pages=597–604 |year=2016 |last1=Walter |first1=Christian }}&lt;/ref&gt; is defined in Walter (2016) as the speech act of mathematical financial risk models. The action of the financial Logos on financial practices is the following: the framing of financial decision-making by risk modelling.

'''''Spilt Milk''''' (original title in [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]]: ''Leite Derramado'') is a novel written by [[Chico Buarque]].

== Synopsis ==
A very old man is in a hospital bed. A member of a traditional Brazilian family, he presents the history of his family in a monologue addressed to his daughter, the nurses, and anyone else who will listen. He follows his family's path from his Portuguese ancestors, including a baron of the [[Empire of Brazil|Empire]], and a [[First Brazilian Republic|First Republic's]] Senator, down to his grandson, a youth from [[Rio de Janeiro]]. His family saga is characterized by social and economic decadence against the background  of Brazilian history over the last two centuries.

'''''The Bridge of San Luis Rey''''' is American author [[Thornton Wilder]]'s second novel, first published in 1927 to worldwide acclaim. It tells the story of several interrelated people who die in the collapse of an [[Inca rope bridge]] in [[Peru]], and the events that lead up to their being on the bridge. A friar who has witnessed the accident then goes about inquiring into the lives of the victims, seeking some sort of cosmic answer to the question of why each had to die. The novel won the [[Pulitzer Prize for the Novel|Pulitzer Prize]] in 1928, and was the best-selling work of fiction that year.

== Plot ==

===Part One: Perhaps an Accident===

The first few pages of the first chapter of ''The Bridge of San Luis Rey'' explain the book's basic premise: this story centers on a (fictional) event that happened in Peru on the road between Lima and Cusco, at noon on Friday, July 20, 1714. A bridge woven by the Incas a century earlier collapsed at that particular moment, while five people were crossing it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/08/science/08bridg.html?ei=5087%0A&amp;em=&amp;en=387989ff3aaa8379&amp;ex=1178856000&amp;pagewanted=all |title=How the Inca Leapt Canyons |author=John Noble Wilford |date=2007-05-08 |publisher=''[[The New York Times]]'' |accessdate=2007-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; The collapse was witnessed by Brother Juniper, a Franciscan monk who was on his way to cross it. Wanting to show the world God's Divine Providence, he sets out to interview everyone he can find who knew the five victims. Over the course of six years, he compiles a huge book of all of the evidence he gathers to show that the beginning and end of a person is all part of God's plan for that person. Part One foretells the burning of the book that occurs at the end of the novel, but it also says that one copy of Brother Juniper's book survives and is at the library of the University of San Marco, where it sits neglected.

===Part Two: the Marquesa de Montemayor; Pepita===

The second section focuses on one of the victims of the collapse: Doña María, the Marquesa de Montemayor. She was the daughter of a wealthy cloth merchant, an ugly child who eventually entered into an arranged marriage and bore a daughter, Clara, whom she loved dearly. Clara was indifferent to her mother, though, and became engaged to a Spanish man and moved across the ocean to Spain where she married. Doña María visits her daughter, but when they cannot get along, she returns to Lima. The only way that they can communicate comfortably is by letter, and Doña María pours her heart into her writing, which becomes so polished that her letters will be read in schools for hundreds of years after her death.

Doña María takes as her companion Pepita, a girl raised at the Convent of Santa María Rosa de la Rosas. When she learns that her daughter in Spain is pregnant, Doña María decides to make a pilgrimage to the shrine of Santa María de Cluxambuqua. Pepita goes along as company and to supervise the staff. When Doña María is out at the shrine, Pepita stays at the inn and writes a letter to her patron, the Abbess, complaining about her misery and loneliness. Doña María sees the letter on the table when she gets back and reads it. Later, she asks Pepita about the letter, and Pepita says she tore it up because the letter was not brave. Doña María has new insight into the ways in which her own life and love for her daughter have lacked bravery. She writes her "first letter" (actually Letter LVI) of courageous love to her daughter, but two days later, returning to Lima, she and Pepita are on the bridge when it collapses.

===Part Three: Esteban===

Esteban and Manuel are twins who were left at the Convent of Santa María Rosa de la Rosas as infants. The Abbess of the convent, Madre María del Pilar, developed a fondness for them as they grew up. When they became older, they decided to be scribes. They are so close that they have developed a secret language that only they understand. Their closeness becomes strained when Manuel falls in love with Camila Perichole.

Perichole flirts with Manuel and swears him to secrecy when she retains him to write letters to her lover, the Viceroy. Esteban has no idea of their relationship until she turns up at the twins' room one night in a hurry and has Manuel write to a bullfighter with whom she is having an affair. Esteban encourages his brother to follow her, but instead Manuel swears that he will never see her again.

Manuel cuts his knee on a piece of metal and it becomes infected. The surgeon instructs Esteban to put cold compresses on the injury: the compresses are so painful that Manuel curses Esteban, though he later remembers nothing of his curses. Esteban offers to send for Perichole, but Manuel refuses. Soon after, Manuel dies.

When the Abbess comes to prepare the body, she asks Esteban his name, and he says he is Manuel. Gossip about his ensuing strange behavior spreads all over town. He goes to the theater but runs away before Perichole can talk to him; the Abbess tries to talk to him, but he runs away, so she sends for Captain Alvarado.

Captain Alvarado goes to see Esteban in Cuzco and hires him to sail the world with him, far from Peru. Esteban agrees, then refuses, then acquiesces if he can get all his pay in advance to buy a present for the Abbess before he departs. That night Esteban attempts suicide but is saved by Captain Alvarado. The Captain offers to take him back to Lima to buy the present, and at the ravine, the Captain goes down to a boat that is ferrying some materials across the water. Esteban goes to the bridge and is on it when it collapses.

===Part Four: Uncle Pio; Don Jaime===

Uncle Pio acts as Camila Perichole's valet, and, in addition, "her singing-master, her coiffeur, her masseur, her reader, her errand-boy, her banker; rumor added: her father." The story tells of his background. He was born the bastard son of a Madrid aristocrat, has traveled widely engaged in a wide variety of dubious, though legal, businesses, most related to being a go-between or agent of the powerful, including (briefly) conducting interrogations for the Inquisition. His life "became too complicated" and he fled to Peru. He came to realize that he had just three interests in the world: independence; the constant presence of beautiful women; and work with the masterpieces of Spanish literature, particularly in the theater.

He finds work as the confidential agent of the Viceroy of Peru. One day, he discovers a twelve-year-old café singer, [[Micaela Villegas]], and takes her under his protection. Over the course of years, as they travel from tavern to tavern throughout Latin America, she becomes beautiful and talented. Uncle Pio teaches her and goads her to greatness by expressing perpetual disappointment with her performances. She develops into The Perichole, the most honored actress in Lima.

After years of success, Perichole becomes bored with the stage. The Viceroy takes her as his mistress, and she and Uncle Pio and the Archbishop of Peru and, eventually, Captain Alvarado meet frequently at midnight for dinner at the Viceroy's mansion. Through it all, Uncle Pio is faithfully devoted, but as Camila ages and has three children by the Viceroy she focuses on becoming a lady, not an actress. She avoids Uncle Pio, and when he talks to her she tells him to not use her stage name.

When a smallpox epidemic sweeps through Lima, Camila is disfigured by it. She takes her son Jaime to the country. Uncle Pio sees her one night trying hopelessly to cover her pock-marked face with powder: ashamed, she refuses to ever see him again. He begs her to allow him to take her son and teach the boy as he taught her. They leave the next morning. Uncle Pio and Jaime are the fourth and fifth people on the bridge to Lima when it collapses.

===Part Five: Perhaps an Intention===

Brother Juniper works for six years on his book about the bridge collapse, trying various mathematical formulas to measure spiritual traits, with no results beyond conventionally pious generalizations. He compiles his huge book of interviews with complete faith in God's goodness and justice, but a council pronounces his work heresy, and the book and Brother Juniper are burned in the town square.

The story shifts back in time to the day of a service for those who died in the bridge collapse. The Archbishop, the Viceroy, and Captain Alvarado are at the ceremony. At the Convent of Santa María Rosa de la Rosas, the Abbess feels, having lost Pepita and the twin brothers, that her work will die with her. A year after the accident, Camila Perichole seeks out the Abbess to ask how she can go on, having lost her son and Uncle Pio. Camila gains comfort and insight from the Abbess and, it is revealed later, becomes a helper at the Convent. Later, Doña Clara arrives from Spain, also seeking out the Abbess. She is greatly moved by the work of the Abbess in caring for the deaf, the insane, and the dying. The novel ends with the Abbess's observation: "There is a land of the living and a land of the dead and the bridge is love, the only survival, the only meaning."

==Themes and sources==
Thornton Wilder said that the book poses the question: "Is there a direction and meaning in lives beyond the individual's own will?"&lt;ref name=tws&gt;[http://www.tcnj.edu/~wilder/works/bridge.html "The Bridge of San Luis Rey (1927)"], Thornton Wilder Society.&lt;/ref&gt; Describing the sources of his novel, Wilder explained that the plot was inspired &lt;blockquote&gt;
in its external action by a one-act play [''Le Carrosse du Saint-Sacrement''] by [the French playwright] [[Prosper Mérimée]], which takes place in Latin America and one of whose characters is a [[courtesan]]. However, the central idea of the work, the justification for a number of human lives that comes up as a result of the sudden collapse of a bridge, stems from friendly arguments with my father, a strict [[Calvinist]]. Strict [[Puritan]]s imagine God all too easily as a petty schoolmaster who minutely weights guilt against merit, and they overlook God's '[[Charity (virtue)|Caritas]]' which is more all-encompassing and powerful. God's love has to transcend his just retribution. But in my novel I have left this question unanswered. As I said earlier, we can only pose the question correctly and clearly, and have faith one will ask the question in the right way.&lt;ref name=tws/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; When asked if his characters were historical or imagined, Wilder replied, "The Perichole and the Viceroy are real people, under the names they had in history [a street singer named [[Micaela Villegas]] and her lover [[Manuel de Amat y Junyent]], who was [[Viceroy of Peru]] at the time]. Most of the events were invented by me, including the fall of the bridge."&lt;ref name=tws/&gt; He based the Marquesa's habit of writing letters to her daughter on his knowledge of the great French letter-writer, [[Madame de Sévigné]].&lt;ref name=tws/&gt;

The bridge itself (in both Wilder's story and Mérimée's play) is based on the great [[Inca]] road suspension bridge across the [[Apurímac River]], erected around 1350, still in use in 1864, and dilapidated but still hanging in 1890.{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}} When asked by the explorer [[Victor Wolfgang von Hagen]] whether he had ever seen a reproduction of [[E. G. Squier]]'s woodcut illustration of the bridge as it was in 1864, Wilder replied: "It is best, von Hagen, that I make no comment or point of it."&lt;ref name=Von_Hagen_1955&gt;

"'''The Wishing-Table, the Gold-Ass, and the Cudgel in the Sack'''" is a fairytale by the [[Brothers Grimm]]. The original [[German language|German]] name is ''Tischlein deck dich, Goldesel und Knüppel aus dem Sack''.

==Plot==

A [[tailor]] had three sons who were all fed by the milk of their goat. The oldest son was given the task to let the animal graze at the finest grass fields. At the end of the day the son asked the goat whether it had eaten enough and the animal confirmed this. However, when they returned home the goat claimed the opposite, causing the tailor to get upset and drive his son out of the house. This pattern repeats itself with the second oldest and youngest son too, who are also falsely blamed by the goat for not feeding it enough and as a result are kicked out of the house as well. Only when the father goes out to feed the goat himself and discovers that the creature still claims it hasn't eaten enough does he realize he misjudged his sons. He takes his [[razor]], shaves the goat bare and uses his [[whip]] to drive it out of his house. The tailor is left alone in his house longing for his sons' return.

The story then follows each son individually. The first one went to a maker of [[furniture]] and learned the craft. After his service his master gave him a magic table as a sign of gratitude. Whenever he says "Table, Deck Yourself" the table decks itself with the finest food and wine. The son decides to travel home and show his father what he learned and earned. On his way he visits a local [[inn]], where he demonstrates the powers of the magic table. At night the inn keeper steals the table and switches it for a normal table, without the son being aware. When the son arrives home and tries to show the powers of the table to his father nothing happens, which upsets his father once again.
[[File:Grimm1917-00104.png|thumb|&lt;center&gt;Arthur Rackham, 1917&lt;/center&gt;]]
The second son goes to work for a [[miller]]. His master gives him a magical [[donkey]] who is able to produce [[gold]] out of its mouth and behind at the command of "Bricklebrit!" Just like the oldest son, the second son decides to travel home and happens to visit the same inn his brother did. He too demonstrates the powers of the donkey to the innkeeper who once again steals the animal at night and replaces it with a normal donkey, without the son being aware of what happened. When the son arrives home and tries to show the powers of the donkey instead of gold pieces landing on the cloth, it is droppings like an ordinary donkey, which upsets his father once again.

The third son went to work for a [[woodsmith]] and is given a magic [[cudgel]] in a bag. Whenever someone is injust the owner of the cudgel just needs to say: "Cudgel, out the sack!" and the object will start clobbering the wrongdoer. Only when the owner says: "Cudgel in the sack!" will the thing return in the bag. Just like his brothers, the son visits the same inn, because he learned from their letters on what had happened. Instead of demonstrating the powers of his possession he deliberately remains vague about it, making the inn keeper curious enough to go out at night and try to look what's in the bag. Anticipating this, the son orders the cudgel to beat the inn keeper up until he returns everything he has stolen. When the son returns home with the table, donkey and cudgel he tells his father what had happened and demonstrates the powers of the objects. His father finally makes peace with his sons and they all live a rich life ever after.

As an [[epilogue]], the story also informs the reader what happened to the goat. The shaven animal went to hide inside a fox hole. When the fox returned home it was scared away by the goat's eyes. The fox asks a bear for help, but he is also too frightened to go in. Finally they take a [[bee]] along with them, who stings the goat, causing the animal to run away in pain. The storyteller concludes that nobody knows where she is now.

==In popular culture==

The table (since 1999), donkey (since 1956) and cudgel (since 1963) are exhibited in the Dutch theme park [[De Efteling]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.efteling.com/NL/Over-de-Efteling/Sprookjes-bestaan/Efteldingen-Sprookjes/Lees-hier-alle-Sprookjes/Tafeltje-Dek-je.html&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Velificatio''''' is a stylistic device used in [[Roman art|ancient Roman art]] to frame a [[List of Roman deities|deity]] by means of a billowing garment. It represents "vigorous movement," an [[theophany|epiphany]],&lt;ref&gt;Paul Rehak, ''Imperium and Cosmos: Augustus and the Northern Campus Martius'' (University of Wisconsin Press, 2006), p. 111.&lt;/ref&gt; or "the vault of heaven," often appearing with celestial, weather, or sea deities.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Turcan, ''Les religions de l'Asie dans la vallée du Rhône'' (Brill, 1972), p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt; It is characteristic of the [[iconography]] of the [[Aura (mythology)|Aurae]], the Breezes [[personification|personified]], and one of the elements which distinguish representations of Luna, the Roman [[Moon goddess|goddess of the Moon]], alluding to her astral course.&lt;ref&gt;Stefania Sorrenti, "Les représentations figurées de Jupiter Dolichénien à Rome," in ''La terra sigillata tardo-italica decorata del Museo nazionale romano'', «L'Erma» di Bretschneider, 1999), p. 370.&lt;/ref&gt;

A figure so framed is a '''''velificans''''' (plural '''''velificantes'''''). Not all deities are portrayed as ''velificantes'', but the device might be used to mark a member of the [[Roman Emperor|Imperial family]] who had been divinized (a [[Divus|''divus'' or ''diva'']]).&lt;ref&gt;Lise Vogel, ''The Column of Antoninus Pius'' (Harvard University Press, 1973), p. 45.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Velificatio'' is a frequent device in Roman art,&lt;ref&gt;Hélène Walter, ''La Porte Noire de Besançon'' (Presses Univ. Franche-Comté, 1984), vol. 1, p. 332.&lt;/ref&gt; including painting, [[mosaic]], [[relief]], and [[Roman sculpture|sculpture]], though it poses technical difficulties for freestanding sculpture. The Athenian sculptor [[Praxiteles]] was able to achieve it.&lt;ref&gt;Pliny, ''Natural History'' 36.29; Davide Stimilli, ''The Face of Immortality: Physiognomy and Criticism'' (State University of New York Press, 2005), p. 172.&lt;/ref&gt; The term is also used to describe [[Hellenistic art]].&lt;ref&gt;Brunilde Sismondo Ridgway, ''Hellenistic Sculpture II: The Styles of ca. 200–100 B.C.'' (University of Wisconsin Press, 2000), ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=Y6Jj6rcIup4C&amp;pg=PA124&amp;dq=velificatio+OR+velificantes+OR+velificans&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=c5ZJTYfmBIKClAez4ZXYDw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CEMQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=velificatio%20OR%20velificantes%20OR%20velificans&amp;f=false passim.]''&lt;/ref&gt; The device continued to be used in later [[Western art history|Western art]], in which it is sometimes described as an ''aura'', "a breeze that blows from either without or from within that lifts the veil to reveal the face of an otherwise invisible being."&lt;ref&gt;The term is so used in the art criticism of [[Walter Benjamin]]; Aleida Assmann and Jan Assmann, "Air From Other Planets Blowing: The Logic of Authenticity and the Prophet of the Aura," in ''Mapping Benjamin: The Work of Art in the Digital Age'' (Stanford University Press, 2003), pp. 153–154.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Usage and examples==
In [[classical Latin]], the [[abstract noun]] ''velificatio'' is uncommon,&lt;ref&gt;It occurs in [[Cicero]], ''Ad familiares'' 1.9.21, and not again in Latin literature until Fronto, 267,4–5; Michel P.J. van den Hout, ''A Commentary on the Letters of M. Cornelius Fronto'' (Brill, 1999), p. 608.&lt;/ref&gt; and refers to the act of setting sail, from ''velum'', "sail" (but also "cloth, garment, veil") and the ''-fic-'' combining element from ''-ficio, -ficere'' (= ''facio, facere'', "do, make"). The verbal form was the basis for modern scholarly usage. [[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]] describes ''[[Aura (mythology)|Aurae]] velificantes sua veste'', the Breezes "making a sail with their own garment"&lt;ref&gt;[[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]], ''Natural History'' 36.29.&lt;/ref&gt; at the [[Porticus Octaviae]] ("[[Portico]] of [[Octavia the Younger|Octavia]]").&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Köves-Zulauf, "Plinius d. Ä. und die römische Religion," ''Aufstieg und Niedergang der römischen Welt'' II.16.1 (1978), p. 277.&lt;/ref&gt; Such depictions of the Aurae are known from extant Roman art, and have been used as comparative material to identify the pair of ''velificantes'' in a scene from the [[Ara Pacis|Augustan Altar of Peace]]. On the basis of a passage from the ''[[Carmen Saeculare]]'' of [[Horace]], composed and performed for [[Augustus]]'s staging of the [[Saecular Games]] in 17 BC, the central figure is often identified as Tellus (Earth):

&lt;blockquote&gt;Fertile in produce and cattle, let Tellus grant Ceres a crown of grain; let the healthful waters and breezes of Jove nourish offspring.&lt;ref&gt;''Fertilis frugum pecorisque Tellus / spicea donet Cererem corona; / nutriant fetus et aquae salubres / et Iovis aurae''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Not all scholars agree on this analysis of the scene. The creatures on which the ''velificantes'' are seated also suggest [[Nereids]], and the reference may point to the [[Cult of the Nymphs]].&lt;ref&gt;Babette Stanley Spaeth, "The Goddess Ceres in the Ara Pacis Augustae and the Carthage Relief," ''American Journal of Archaeology'' 98 (1994), pp. 77–78.&lt;/ref&gt;

The significance of the veil is sometimes explained in terms of the [[initiation rite]]s of the [[mystery religions]]. Initiates wore drapery or a veil which was lifted by a priestess. The veil was a symbol of death, and its removal in the rite signified the initiate's rebirth. The ''velificatio'' thus appears in scenes on [[sarcophagi]] and in other [[funerary art]].&lt;ref&gt;Elisabeth Matelli, "Hieronymous in Athens and Rhodes", in ''Lyco of Troas and Hieronymous of Rhodes'' (Transaction Publishers, 2004), pp. 294–295.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Wasta''' or '''wasata''' (Arabic: واسِطة ''wāsiṭah'') is an Arabic word that loosely translates into [[nepotism]], '[[Wiktionary:clout#Noun|clout]]' or 'who you know'. It refers to using one’s connections and/or influence to get things done, including government transactions such as the quick renewal of a passport, waiving of traffic fines, and getting hired for or promoted in a job.

In other words, it amounts to getting something through favoritism rather than merit, or what is informally spoken of in English as "pull" from connections (the opposite of "push"). The English word [[cronyism]] overlaps in meaning but is not precisely the same. Roughly equivalent words in other languages include [[sociolismo]] in Cuba; [[Blat (Russia)|blat]] in Russia; [[guanxi]] in Chinese  and ''Vetternwirtschaft'' in German, ''protektzia'' in Israeli slang, ''un pituto'' in Chilean Spanish, In Brazilian-Portuguese it is referred to as "pistolão", "QI" (''Quem Indica'', or Who Indicates), or in the slang "peixada", "Pidi Padu" in [[Malayalam]], "arka" or "destek" in Turkish, "plecy" in Polish, "štela" in Bosnian.

==Etymology==
Wasta is derived from the Modern Standard [[Arabic]] word واسِطَة (''wāsiṭah'') which can mean ''medium, means'' but also ''personal connection used to gain something''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Hans Wehr]] (1979), ''[[Arabic-English Dictionary]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Furthermore, companies in the [[Arab world]] rarely have a 'no-[[nepotism]]' policy in place, so one can often find a workforce with friends and friends relatives who may or may not be qualified. This takes place in both the public and private sectors.

In many Arab countries, such as [[Oman]], [[Iraq]], [[Lebanon]], [[Kuwait]], [[UAE]], [[Saudi Arabia]] and especially [[Jordan]], wasta affects hiring and promotion decisions. This is not restricted to Arab nationals but is also practised by expatriates who use their connections as wastas.

With respect to recruitment, there seems to be a movement away from this wasta, especially in the case of multinationals and professional firms. However, Wasta is still widely used in the region.
