The '''1998 United States Capitol shooting incident''' was an attack on July 24, 1998, which led to the deaths of two [[United States Capitol Police]] officers. Officer [[Jacob Chestnut]] and Detective [[John Gibson (police officer)|John Gibson]] were killed when Russell Eugene Weston, Jr., entered the [[United States Capitol|Capitol]] and opened fire.&lt;ref name=CNN&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.cnn.com/US/9807/24/dc.shooting.03/ | title = 2 dead, 2 hurt in U.S. Capitol shooting | publisher = CNN.com | accessdate = January 19, 2007 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20061029233005/http://www.cnn.com/US/9807/24/dc.shooting.03/ |archivedate = October 29, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chestnut was killed instantly and Gibson died during surgery at [[George Washington University Hospital]]. Weston's exact motives are unknown, but he has a [[mental disorder]] and maintains a strong distrust of the federal government. He remains in a mental institution due to [[paranoid schizophrenia]] and has yet to be tried in court.

==Shooting==
On the day of shooting, Officer Chestnut and another officer were assigned to operate the X-ray machine and magnetometer at the Document Door entrance located on the East Front of the Capitol, which was open only to [[Member of Congress|Members of Congress]] and their staff. Detective Gibson was assigned to the dignitary protection detail of Rep. Tom DeLay (R-TX) and was in his suite of offices near this door. Weston, armed with a [[.38 S&amp;W|.38 caliber]] [[Smith &amp; Wesson]] six-shot revolver, entered the Document Door at 3:40&amp;nbsp;p.m. At the same time, Officer Chestnut was providing directions to a tourist and his son while his partner escorted another tourist towards the restroom.&lt;ref name=buried/&gt; Weston reportedly walked around the [[metal detector]] just inside the entrance; Chestnut requested he go back through the detector.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/national/longterm/shooting/stories/main072598.htm | title = Gunman Shoots His Way Into Capitol; Two Officers Killed, Suspect Captured | publisher = Washingtonpost.com | accessdate = January 12, 2007 | date=January 30, 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; Weston suddenly produced the gun and without warning, shot Chestnut in the back of the head at point-blank range. According to witnesses, he turned down a short corridor and pushed through a door which leads to a group of offices used by senior Republican representatives including then [[Party whips of the United States House of Representatives|Majority Whip]] [[Tom DeLay]] and Representative [[Dennis Hastert]], future [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives|Speaker of the House]] and a close [[Mentorship|protégé]] of then [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives|Speaker]] [[Newt Gingrich]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.emergency.com/capshoot.htm | title = Attack on Capitol Hill | publisher = EmergencyNet News | accessdate = January 11, 2007 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20061208155832/http://emergency.com/capshoot.htm |archivedate = December 8, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Detective Gibson, who was in plainclothes, was shot after the suspect entered DeLay's office. Despite being mortally wounded, Detective Gibson was able to return fire and wound the suspect, who was apprehended in that office.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = https://www.nytimes.com/1998/07/25/us/capitol-hill-slayings-the-overview-gunman-invades-capitol-killing-2-guards.html?sec=health | title = Capitol Hill Slayings: The Overview; Gunman Invades Capitol, Killing 2 Guards | publisher = Newyorktimes.com | accessdate = January 11, 2007 | first=Francis X. | last=Clines | date=July 25, 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; A female tourist was grazed by bullets on her shoulder and face.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4196/is_19980726/ai_n10434376 "Horrifying Capitol ordeal began with officer's execution"].

General Hospital.&lt;ref name=CNN/&gt;

==After the shooting==
[[File:Capitol Police Honor Guard - 1998 shooting.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|A Capitol Police Honor Guard salutes the coffins of Officer Jacob Chestnut and Detective John Gibson in the Capitol Rotunda as they lie in repose]]

Officers Chestnut and Gibson were the two people killed in the attack. Following the shooting, both officers received the tribute of [[lying in honor]] in the [[United States Capitol rotunda]]. They were the first police officers, and Chestnut was the first [[African American]], to receive the honor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c105:H.R.4347: | title = Authorizing the use of the Rotunda of the Capitol... | publisher = United States Senate}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1999, Weston was found incompetent to stand trial due to mental illness as he was a man with [[schizophrenia]] who stopped taking his medication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url= http://www.cnn.com/ALLPOLITICS/stories/1999/04/22/capitol.shooting/ | title = Weston found incompetent to stand trial for Capitol shooting | publisher = CNN.com | accessdate = January 11, 2007 | first=Terry | last=Frieden}}&lt;/ref&gt; A judge of the [[United States District Court for the District of Columbia]] ordered that he be treated with [[antipsychotic drugs|antipsychotic medication]] without his consent in 2001, and the [[United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit]] upheld the decision.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nypress.com/14/29/news&amp;columns/feature.cfm |title=Capitol Shooter Russell Weston, Three Years Later |publisher=New York Press |accessdate=January 11, 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061128114804/http://www.nypress.com/14/29/news%26columns/feature.cfm |archivedate=November 28, 2006 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004, the court determined that Weston still was not competent to be tried, despite ongoing treatment, and suspended but did not dismiss the [[Criminal law|criminal]] charges against him. Weston was known to the [[United States Secret Service]] prior to the incident as a person who had threatened the President of the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.cnn.com/US/9807/24/dc.shooting.04/ | title = Capitol shooting suspect was 'low-level threat' to Clinton | publisher = CNN.com | accessdate = January 11, 2007 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20050913025541/http://www.cnn.com/US/9807/24/dc.shooting.04/ |archivedate = September 13, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Officer Jacob Chestnut, USCP.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Officer Jacob Chestnut, [[United States Capitol Police|USCP]]]]

The shooting led to the creation of the United States Capitol Police Memorial Fund, a nonprofit organization managed by the [[Capitol Police Board]] which provides funds for the families of Chestnut and Gibson.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/02/1953- | title= U.S. Code Title 2, 1953 | publisher= Cornell Law School | accessdate= January 17, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2005, the fund was expanded to include the family of Sgt. Christopher Eney, a USCP officer killed during a training accident in 1984.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.house.gov/list/press/az01_renzi/flagfootball.html | title = Members, Capitol Police Square Off in 2006 "Longest Yard" Flag Football Game | publisher = Rep.

The legislation authorizing the construction of the facility was introduced by [[Washington, D.C.]] [[Delegate (United States Congress)|Delegate]] [[Eleanor Holmes Norton]] and was entitled the ''Jacob Joseph Chestnut-John Michael Gibson United States Capitol Visitor Center Act of 1998''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c105:H.R.4347: | title = Jacob Joseph Chestnut-John Michael Gibson United States Capitol Visitor Center Act of 1998 (Introduced in House)

(Introduced in Senate) | publisher = United States Senate | accessdate = January 18, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 6, 2008, Weston filed a motion requesting a hearing on his mental status. The hearing was held on May 6 with Weston appearing via teleconference from the [[Federal Correctional Complex, Butner|Federal Medical Center, Butner]] with his public defender Jane Pierce and two witnesses he selected, a psychologist and vocational rehabilitation specialist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Emily |last=Yehle |title= Weston unlikely to ever be tried |format= |work= Roll Call |publisher= Roll Call, Inc. |location= Washington, D.C. |id= |pages= 1, 16 |date= May 7, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Federal judge Earl Britt denied Weston's request to be released from the federal facility, arguing that he failed to present enough evidence that he no longer needed to be committed. During the hearing defense psychologist Holly Rogers stated that, "sometimes there are individuals who simply do not respond to medication", implying that Weston was not ready for release. Had Weston been released from the facility, it would have made it possible for him to be taken to Washington, D.C. to stand trial for the murders of Gibson and Chestnut.&lt;ref name="Yehle 1, 18"/&gt;

==Officers==

[[Image:Detective John Gibson, USCP.jpg|thumb|upright|Detective John Gibson, USCP]]

[[Detective]] '''John Michael Gibson''' (March 29, 1956 – July 24, 1998) was a United States Capitol Police officer assigned to the dignitary protection detail of Congressman Tom DeLay. He is buried in [[Arlington National Cemetery]] after [[lying in honor]] with Chestnut in the Capitol rotunda. Detective Gibson had served with the agency for 18 years. He was a native of [[Massachusetts]] who married the niece of Representative [[Joe Moakley]], Democrat of Massachusetts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = https://www.nytimes.com/1998/07/27/us/capitol-hill-slayings-the-police-congress-to-pay-tribute-to-slain-officers.html?sec=health | title = Capitol Hill slayings: The Police; Congress to Pay Tribute to Slain Officers | publisher = Newyorktimes.com| accessdate = January 17, 2007 | first=Eric | last=Schmitt | date=July 27, 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; He had three children, a 17-year-old daughter and two boys, ages 15 and 14.&lt;ref name=buried&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.arlingtoncemetery.net/gib-ches.htm | title = Capitol Police Officers laid to rest in Arlington National Cemetery | publisher = Michael Robert Patterson | accessdate = January 11, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Growing up in New England, Det. Gibson was a lifelong [[Boston Red Sox]] fan, and on August 11, 1998, his beloved team had a moment of silence in his honor prior to a game with the [[Kansas City Royals]].{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}

Officer '''Jacob Joseph Chestnut''' (April 28, 1940 – July 24, 1998), was the first [[African American]] to [[lying in honor|lie in honor]] at the Capitol. Chestnut is buried in [[Arlington National Cemetery]]. His funeral included a speech by President [[Bill Clinton]] and a fly-over by military jets in a [[missing man formation]]. A United States Post Office located in Fort Washington, Maryland has been renamed in their honor.&lt;ref name=buried/&gt;

==Suspect==
'''Russell Eugene Weston, Jr.''' (born December 28, 1956), also known as Rusty, grew up in [[Valmeyer, Illinois|Valmeyer]], [[Illinois]]. Weston attended Valmeyer High School, the only high school in a town of 900 people. Shortly after graduating from high school in 1974, Weston moved to [[Rimini, Montana]], rarely returning to Valmeyer. The only attempt his high school classmates made at inviting him to a class reunion was returned with obscenities written across it.&lt;ref name=hospitalized&gt;{{cite news | url = https://www.nytimes.com/1998/07/26/us/capitol-hill-slayings-the-suspect-man-hospitalized-in-96-for-ominous-letters.html?sec=health&amp;pagewanted=all | title = Capitol Hill Slayings: The Suspect; Man Hospitalized in '96 for Ominous Letters | publisher = Newyorktimes.com | accessdate = January 19, 2007 | date=July 26, 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of Weston's Montana neighbors had disliked him, and often ignored him. They considered him to be unusual, and sometimes [[Eccentricity (behavior)|eccentric]]. Weston had once thought that his neighbor was using his [[television]] [[satellite dish]] to spy on his actions and believed Navy SEALs were hiding in his cornfield.&lt;ref name=hospitalized/&gt;

[[Image:Russellwestonhome.jpg|thumb|left|Weston's cabin next to the lower [[Tenmile Creek (Lewis and Clark County, Montana)|Tenmile Creek]] in [[Montana]] following a search by the police]]

He was diagnosed with [[Schizophrenia|paranoid schizophrenia]] six years before the shooting and spent fifty-three days in a mental hospital after threatening a Montana resident. He was released after testing as being of no danger to himself or anyone else.&lt;ref name=access/&gt; Eighteen months before the shooting, he moved back to Valmeyer from Montana. Once home, he was known to compulsively hack at trees which filled his back yard following the [[Great Flood of 1993|Mississippi River floods of 1993]]. There was so much downed timber on his family's homestead that they had to ask him to stop cutting at trees.&lt;ref name=access&gt;{{cite news | url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/national/longterm/shooting/stories/weston081098.htm | title = Before the Shootings, a String of Excesses | publisher = Washingtonpost.com | accessdate = January 11, 2007 | date=January 30, 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two days prior to the Capitol shooting, at his grandmother's insistence to do something about nearby [[cat]]s which were becoming a nuisance, Weston shot and killed 14 cats with a single-barreled shotgun, leaving several in a bucket and burying the rest.&lt;ref name=access/&gt;

Following the Capitol shooting, Weston was transferred to a psychiatric center at [[Butner Federal Correctional Institution]] in [[Butner, North Carolina]]. In an interview with a court-appointed psychiatrist he explained that he stormed the Capitol to prevent the United States from being annihilated by disease and legions of cannibals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/national/longterm/shooting/stories/weston042399.htm | title = Capitol Shooter's Mind-Set Detailed | publisher = Washingtonpost.com | accessdate = January 26, 2010 | date=April 23, 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He has never been charged with any crime due to apparent mental [[culpability|inculpability]]. One contentious issue of Weston's incarceration is that of forced medication. Weston has thus far refused to take any medications voluntarily. His lawyers helped enable this, in order to protect him from the death penalty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/03/03/opinion/insanity-goes-back-on-trial.html?pagewanted=all | work=The New York Times | first=Sally | last=Satel | title=Insanity Goes Back on Trial | date=March 3, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2001, a federal judge authorized doctors to treat Weston involuntarily. A panel from a federal appeals court ruled in July 2001 that Weston could be forced to take the drugs which he was forced to do for 120 days.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?sec=health&amp;res=9F07E5DE153BF930A3575BC0A9649C8B63&amp;n=Top%2fReference%2fTimes%20Topics%2fPeople%2fC%2fChestnut%2c%20Jacob%20J%2e | title = Judge Rules Capitol Gunman Can Be Forced to Take Medicine | publisher = Newyorktimes.com | accessdate = January 19, 2007 | date=August 3, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; He remains in the Butner facility indefinitely.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}

'''Abu Muhammad ar-Rashid Abd al-Wahid''' ({{lang-ar|أبو محمد الرشيد عبد الواحد بن المأمون}};  Abū Muḥammad Ar-Rashīd `Abd al-Wāḥid ibn Al-Mā'mūn; died 4 December 1242)  was an [[Almohad Caliphate|Almohad]] rival caliph who reigned from 1232 until his death.

Abd al-Wahid succeeded his father [[Idris al-Ma'mun|Idris I]], who had died while marching against [[Yahya, Almohad Caliph|Yahya]], who was in control of the capital [[Marrakesh]].  His reign marked the beginning of the final fragmentation of the Almohad empire. He was not able to oust Yahya from Marrakesh, while the [[Kingdom of Tlemcen|Emir of Tlemcen]] become independent from 1236 (founding the [[Zayyanid dynasty]]), following the example of the [[Hafsid dynasty|Hafsid]] ruler [[Abu Zakariya Yahya]] in [[Tunisia]].

==Death==
In 1242 he ordered his governor to fight another secession, that of the [[Marinid dynasty|Marinid]] [[Abu Yahya ibn Abd al-Haqq]], who had captured [[Fes]]. However, Abd al-Wahid was discovered drowned in a pool (or he died from a fall) in his palace in December of the same year. He was succeeded  by his brother [[Abu al-Hasan as-Said al-Mutadid]].

'''Ada of Huntingdon''' ({{circa|1139}} &amp;ndash; after 1206) was a Scottish noblewoman and [[Count of Holland|Countess of Holland]] by marriage to [[Floris III, Count of Holland]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.historici.nl/Onderzoek/Projecten/DVN/lemmata/data/AdavanSchotland/en Online Dictionary of Dutch Women]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
Ada was born in [[Kingdom of Scotland|Scotland]], the daughter of [[Henry, Earl of Northumbria|Henry of Huntingdon]] (1114–1152) and [[Ada de Warenne]] (died {{circa|1178}}). Henry was the son of King [[David I of Scotland]] and [[Maud, Countess of Huntingdon]], and Ada's siblings include the Scottish kings [[Malcolm IV of Scotland|Malcolm IV]], [[William the Lion]], and David of Scotland, Earl of Huntingdon.

=== Countess of Holland ===
In 1162 she was asked for her hand in marriage to [[Floris III, Count of Holland]] ({{circa|1141}}&amp;ndash;1190) by the Abbot of [[Egmond Abbey|Egmond]], Holland. Together, the Abbot and Ada traveled back to Holland, where the wedding ceremony occurred, probably in Egmond, on 28 August 1162. Ada received the [[County of Ross]] in the Scottish Highlands as a wedding gift.

Ada was not actively involved in the governance of the [[County of Holland]] but was occasionally mentioned in documents. Floris, her husband was a loyal ally of the Holy Roman Emperor, [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick I]], and often went with him into battle. Dutch chronicler [[Melis Stoke]] states that she supported her son in the war with William of Cleves during the War of Succession. In addition, Ada is known to have read Latin. Ada died after 1206 and was probably buried in the Abbey of [[Middelburg]], to which she had already made donations of £64.

Ada and Floris had 8 or 10 children, of whom some died young

==Issue==

# [[Ada of Holland|Ada]] (died after 1205), married 1176 Margrave [[Otto I, Margrave of Brandenburg|Otto I of Brandenburg]]

The '''American paddlefish''' (''Polyodon spathula'') is a species of [[Basal (phylogenetics)|basal]] [[ray-finned fish]] closely related to [[sturgeon]]s in the [[Order (biology)|order]] [[Acipenseriformes]]. Fossil records of [[paddlefish]] date back over 300{{nbsp}}million years, nearly 50{{nbsp}}million years before dinosaurs first appeared.  American paddlefish are smooth-skinned freshwater fish commonly called paddlefish, but are also referred to as Mississippi paddlefish, spoon-billed cats, or spoonbills.  They are one of only two [[extant taxon|extant species]] in the paddlefish family, [[Polyodontidae]]. The other is the critically endangered [[Chinese paddlefish]] (''Psephurus gladius'') [[endemic]] to the [[Yangtze River]] basin in [[China]].  American paddlefish are often referred to as [[primitive fish]], or [[Relict (biology)|relict species]] because they retain some morphological characteristics of their early ancestors, including a skeleton that is almost entirely [[cartilaginous]], a paddle-shaped [[Rostrum (anatomy)|rostrum]] (snout) that extends nearly one-third their body length, and a [[heterocercal]] tail or [[caudal fin]], much like that of [[sharks]]. American paddlefish are a highly [[Synapomorphy|derived]] fish because they have evolved with adaptations such as filter feeding.  Their rostrum and cranium are covered with tens of thousands of sensory receptors for locating swarms of [[zooplankton]], which is their primary food source.

American paddlefish are native to the [[Mississippi River]] basin and once moved freely under the relatively natural, unaltered conditions that existed prior to the early 1900s.  They commonly inhabited large, free-flowing rivers, [[braided river|braided channels]], backwaters, and [[oxbow lake]]s throughout the Mississippi River drainage basin, and adjacent Gulf drainages.  Their peripheral range extended into the [[Great Lakes]], with occurrences in Lake Huron and Lake Helen in Canada until about 90 years ago.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dfo-mpo.gc.ca/species-especes/species-especes/paddlefish-spatulaire-eng.htm |publisher=Fisheries and Oceans Canada |title=Aquatic Species at Rick&amp;nbsp;— The Paddlefish |date=June 28, 2010 |accessdate=December 10, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140807085933/http://www.dfo-mpo.gc.ca/species-especes/species-especes/paddlefish-spatulaire-eng.htm |archivedate=August 7, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  American paddlefish populations have declined dramatically primarily because of [[overfishing]], habitat destruction, and pollution.  [[Poaching]] has also been a contributing factor to their decline and will continue to be as long as the demand for [[caviar]] remains strong.  Naturally occurring American paddlefish populations have been [[Local extinction|extirpated]] from most of their peripheral range, as well as from [[New York (state)|New York]], [[Maryland]], [[Virginia]], and [[Pennsylvania]].  The current range of American paddlefish has been reduced to the [[Mississippi River|Mississippi]] and [[Missouri River]] tributaries and Mobile Bay drainage basin. They are currently found in twenty-two states in the U.S., and those populations are protected under state, federal and international laws.

==Taxonomy, etymology and evolution==
[[File:Paddlefish underwater.jpeg|thumb|260px|An American paddlefish in a large aquarium tank]]

American paddlefish are closely related to [[sturgeons]] in the order [[Acipenseriformes]], an order of [[Basal (phylogenetics)|basal]] [[ray-finned fish]]es that includes sturgeon and [[paddlefish]], several species of which are now extinct.&lt;ref name="RSPB"&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/274/1609/489.full.pdf |publisher=The Royal Society |title=A New Time-Scale for Ray-Finned Fish Evolution |author=Imogen A.

In 1797, French naturalist [[Bernard Germain de Lacépède]] established the genus ''Polyodon'' for paddlefish, which today includes a single extant species, ''Polyodon spathula''. Lacépède disagreed with [[Pierre Joseph Bonnaterre]]'s description in ''[[Tableau encyclopédique et méthodique]]'' (1788), which suggested paddlefish were a species of shark.  Lacépède noted, "The country and habits of this fish are still unknown."  When Lacépède established the [[binomial nomenclature|binomial]], ''Polydon feuille'', he was unaware the species had already been named in 1772 by taxonomist, [[Johann Julius Walbaum]], who described paddlefish as ''[[Squalus]] spathula''.&lt;ref name="JStorHist"&gt;{{cite journal | jstor=1445053 |publisher=American Society of Ichthyologists and Herpetologists | title=History of a Neglected Account of the Paddlefish, ''Polyodon spathula'' | author=Daniel McKinley | journal=Copeia | volume=1984 | issue=1 | pages=201–204| date=February 1984| doi=10.2307/1445053}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="AFS"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.paddlefishfarming.com/files/UpdatesAug2013/Mims_2005_Aquaculture_in_the_21_century-paddlefish.pdf |title=Paddlefish |publisher=American Fisheries Society |editor1=Anita Kelly |editor2=Jeff Silverstein |author1=Steven Mims |author2=William L.

American paddlefish are smooth-skinned and almost entirely cartilaginous. Their eyes are small and directed laterally. They have a large, tapering [[Operculum (fish)|operculum flap]], a large mouth, and a flat, paddle-shaped rostrum that measures approximately one-third of their body length. During the initial stages of development from [[embryo]] to [[hatchling]], American paddlefish have no rostrum. It begins to form shortly after hatching.&lt;ref name="LSU"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.lamer.lsu.edu/pdfs/NFC_Section1.pdf | publisher=Louisiana State University | title=Biology of the Paddlefish | work=Louisiana Marine Education Resources, Classroom Projects | accessdate=June 9, 2014 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714195741/http://www.lamer.lsu.edu/pdfs/NFC_Section1.pdf | archivedate=July 14, 2014 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="FWSBrochure"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fws.gov/midwest/fisheries/library/broch-paddle.pdf|title=Paddlefish ''Polyodon Spathula''|publisher=U.S. Fish &amp; Wildlife Service|date=May 16, 2001|accessdate=June 20, 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924045947/http://www.fws.gov/midwest/fisheries/library/broch-paddle.pdf|archivedate=September 24, 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rostrum is an extension of the cranium, not of the upper and lower jaws or [[Olfactory receptor|olfactory system]] as with the long snouts of other fishes.&lt;ref name="BioScience"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Jennings" /&gt; Other distinguishing characteristics include a deeply forked heterocercal caudal fin and dull coloration, often with mottling, ranging from bluish gray to black [[Dorsal (anatomy)|dorsally]] grading to a whitish underbelly.&lt;ref name="TSU"/&gt;

==Feeding ecology and physiology==
Scientists began to debate the function of the American paddlefish's rostrum when the species was described in the late 1700s.&lt;ref name="OhioEdu" /&gt; They had once believed it was used to excavate bottom substrate or functioned as a balancing mechanism and navigational aid.&lt;ref name="LSU"/&gt; However, laboratory experiments in 1993 that utilized advanced technology in the field of [[electron microscopy]] have established conclusively that the rostrum of American paddlefish is covered with tens of thousands of sensory receptors.  These receptors are morphologically similar to the [[ampullae of Lorenzini]] of sharks and [[Ray (fish)|rays]], and are indeed passive [[Ampullary Receptor|ampullary]]-type [[electroreceptor]]s used by American paddlefish to detect [[plankton]].&lt;ref name="OhioEdu" /&gt;  Clusters of electroreceptors also cover the head and operculum flaps. The American paddlefish's diet consists primarily of [[zooplankton]]. Their electroreceptors can detect weak electrical fields, which signal not only the presence of zooplankton, but also the individual feeding and swimming movements of zooplankton appendages.&lt;ref name="LSU" /&gt; When a swarm of zooplankton is detected, the paddlefish swims forward continuously with their mouth wide open, forcing water over the gill rakers to filter out prey. Such feeding behavior is considered ram suspension-feeding. Further research has indicated that their electroreceptors may also serve as a navigational aid for obstacle avoidance.&lt;ref name="OhioEdu" /&gt;&lt;ref name="LSU"/&gt;

American paddlefish have small undeveloped eyes that are directed laterally. Unlike most fishes, American paddlefish hardly respond to overhead shadows or changes in illumination. [[Electroreception]] appears to have largely replaced vision as a primary sensory modality, which indicates a reliance on electroreceptors for detecting prey.&lt;ref name="OhioEdu" /&gt;&lt;ref name="LSU" /&gt;  However, the rostrum is not their only means of food detection.  Some reports suggest a damaged rostrum would render American paddlefish less capable of foraging efficiently to maintain good health, but laboratory experiments and field research indicate otherwise.&lt;ref name="BioScience" /&gt;&lt;ref name="LSU" /&gt;  As well as electroreceptors on the rostrum, American paddlefish have sensory pores covering nearly half of the skin surface extending from the rostrum to the top of the head down to the tips of the operculum flaps. Studies have indicated that American paddlefish with damaged or abbreviated rostrums are still able to forage and maintain good health.&lt;ref name="BioScience" /&gt;&lt;ref name="LSU" /&gt;

==Reproduction and life cycle==

[[File:American paddlefish fry at 30 days of age - 2013.jpg|thumb|260px|Stages of rostrum development|right]]

American paddlefish are long-lived, sexually late maturing [[pelagic fish]].  Females do not begin spawning until they are seven to ten years old, some as late as sixteen to eighteen years old. Females do not spawn every year, rather they spawn every second or third year.  Males spawn more frequently, usually every year or every other year beginning around age seven, some as late as nine or ten years of age.&lt;ref name="LSU"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ND"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gf.nd.gov/fishing/other-fishing-information/paddlefish-snagging-season/paddlefish-questions-and-answers |publisher=North Dakota Game and Fish Department |title=Paddlefish Questions and Answers |date=2012 |accessdate=June 9, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150624063851/http://gf.nd.gov/fishing/other-fishing-information/paddlefish-snagging-season/paddlefish-questions-and-answers |archivedate=June 24, 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

American paddlefish begin their upstream spawning migration sometime during early spring; some begin in late fall.&lt;ref name="ND"/&gt; They spawn on silt-free gravel bars that would otherwise be exposed to air or covered by very shallow water were it not for the rises in the river from snow melt and annual spring rains that cause flooding.&lt;ref name="MDC"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://nature.mdc.mo.gov/discover-nature/field-guide/search/paddlefish |publisher=Missouri Department of Conservation |title=Paddlefish, ''Polyodon spathula'' |work=Discover Nature Field Guide |accessdate=June 9, 2014 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170824024506/https://nature.mdc.mo.gov/discover-nature/field-guide/search/paddlefish |archivedate=August 24, 2017 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Although availability of preferred spawning habitat is essential, there are three precise environmental events that must occur before American paddlefish will spawn.&lt;ref name="EWS"/&gt;&lt;ref name="LSU" /&gt;  The water temperature must be from {{convert|55|to|60|F|C}}; the lengthened [[Photoperiodism|photoperiod]] which occurs in spring triggers biological and behavioral processes that are dependent on increasing day length; and there must be a proper rise and flow in the river before a successful spawn can occur.  Historically, American paddlefish did not spawn every year because the precise environmental events only occurred once every 4 or 5 years.&lt;ref name="EWS" /&gt;

American paddlefish are [[broadcast spawner]]s, also referred to as mass spawners or synchronous spawners.  [[Gravid]] females release their [[Egg (biology)|eggs]] into the water over bare rocks or gravel at the same time males release their sperm.  Fertilization occurs externally.  The eggs become sticky after they are released into the water and will attach to the bottom substrate. Incubation varies depending on water temperature, but in {{convert|60|F|C|abbr=on}} water the eggs will hatch into larval fish in about seven days.&lt;ref name="ND" /&gt; After hatching, the [[larval fish]] drift downstream into areas of low flow velocity where they forage on zooplankton.&lt;ref name="ND"/&gt;

Young American paddlefish are poor swimmers which makes them susceptible to predation.  Therefore, rapid first-year growth is important to their survival.&lt;ref name="ND" /&gt;  [[Juvenile fish|Fry]] can grow about {{convert|1|in|cm|abbr=on}} per week,&lt;ref name="PA"&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.fish.state.pa.us/anglerboater/1999/jf99/padlfish.htm |title=Progress with Paddlefish Restoration |publisher=Commonwealth of Pennsylvania Fish and Boat Commission |work=Pennsylvania Angler and Boater |author=Dudley Parr |issue=January/February 1999 |accessdate=August 28, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140903095036/https://www.fish.state.pa.us/anglerboater/1999/jf99/padlfish.htm |archivedate=September 3, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and by late July the [[Fingerling (fish)|fingerlings]] are around {{convert|5|-|6|in|cm|abbr=on}} long.&lt;ref name="ND"/&gt;  Their rate of growth is variable and highly dependent on food abundance.  Higher growth rates occur in areas where food is not limited.  The feeding behavior of fingerlings is quite different from that of older juveniles and adults. They capture individual plankton one by one, which requires detection and location of individual ''[[Daphnia]]'' on approach, followed by an intercept maneuver to capture the selected prey.&lt;ref name="OhioEdu" /&gt;  By late September fingerlings have developed into juveniles, and are around {{convert|10|-|12|in|cm|abbr=on}} long.  After the 1st year their growth rate slows and is highly variable.  Studies indicate that by age 5 their growth rate averages around {{convert|2|in|cm|abbr=on}} per year depending on the abundance of food and other environmental influences.&lt;ref name="TSU"/&gt;

==Habitat and distribution==
[[File:Paddlefish distribution.png|thumb|260px|Map of the United States showing distribution of paddlefish]]

American paddlefish are highly mobile and well adapted to living in rivers.&lt;ref name=UMESC/&gt; They inhabit many types of riverine habitats throughout much of the Mississippi Valley and adjacent Gulf slope drainages.  They occur most frequently in deeper, low current areas such as side channels, oxbows, backwater lakes, bayous, and tailwaters below dams.  They have been observed to move more than {{convert|2000|mi|km|abbr=on}} in a river system.&lt;ref name=UMESC/&gt;

American paddlefish are endemic to the Mississippi River Basin, historically occurring from the Missouri and Yellowstone rivers in the northwest to the Ohio and Allegheny rivers of the northeast; the headwaters of the Mississippi River south to its mouth, from the San Jacinto River in the southwest to the Tombigbee and Alabama rivers of the southeast.&lt;ref name="Jennings"/&gt; They were extirpated from New York, Maryland and Pennsylvania, as well as from much of their peripheral range in the Great Lakes region, including Lake Huron and Lake Helen in Canada.&lt;ref name=IUCN2/&gt;&lt;ref name=EWS/&gt; In 1991, Pennsylvania implemented a reintroduction program utilizing hatchery-reared American paddlefish in an effort to establish self-sustaining populations in the upper Ohio and lower Allegheny rivers. In 1998, New York initiated a stocking program upstream in the Allegheny Reservoir above Kinzua Dam, and a second stocking in 2006 in Conewango Creek, a relatively unaltered section of their historic range. Reports of free ranging adults captured by gill nets have since been documented in Pennsylvania and New York, but there is no evidence of natural reproduction.&lt;ref name="Status"&gt;{{cite journal | publisher=American Fisheries Society|title=Status of Paddlefish in the United States |editor1=Craig P.

===Propagation and culture===

The artificial propagation of American paddlefish began with the efforts of the Missouri Department of Conservation during the early 1960s, and focused primarily on maintenance of the sport fishery.&lt;ref name="Propagation"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.paddlefishfarming.com/Mims_2009_Propagation_and_Culture_of_Paddlefish.pdf |publisher=American Fisheries Society |journal=Paddlefish Management, Propagation, and Conservation in the 21st Century |editor1=Craig P.

The number of eggs a female may produce depends on the size of the fish and can range anywhere from 70,000–300,000 eggs.  Unlike most [[teleostei|teleosts]], the [[oviduct]] branches of American paddlefish and sturgeons are not directly attached to the [[ovary|ovaries]]; rather, they open dorsally into the body cavity.  To determine the status of progression toward maturation, ova staging is performed.  The process begins with a minor procedure that involves a small abdominal incision from which to extract a few sample [[oocyte]]s.  The oocytes are boiled in water for a few minutes until the yolk is hardened, and then they are cut in half to expose the nucleus.  The exposed nucleus is examined under a microscope to determine stage of maturity.&lt;ref name="Propagation"/&gt;

Once maturation is confirmed, one of three procedures is used to extract the eggs from a female paddlefish.  The three procedures are (1) the traditional hand-stripping method, considered to be time consuming and laborious; (2) [[Caesarean section]], a relatively quick surgical method of extracting eggs through a {{convert|4|in|cm|abbr=on}} abdominal incision; considered faster than hand stripping, suturing can be time consuming and the incision may result in muscular stress and poor suture retention which lowers survival rate; and (3) MIST, (minimally invasive surgical technique) which is the fastest of the three procedures because it requires less handling of the fish and eliminates the need for suturing.  A small internal incision is made in the dorsal area of the oviduct, which allows direct stripping of eggs from the body cavity through the [[gonopore]] bypassing the oviductal funnels.&lt;ref name="SRAC"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www2.ca.uky.edu/wkrec/PaddlefishProduction.pdf |publisher=Southern Regional Aquaculture Center |title=Production of Paddlefish |author1=Steven D.

A spermiating male indicates successful production of mature [[Spermatozoon|spermatozoa]] which results in the release of large volumes of [[milt]] over the course of three to four days. Milt is collected by inserting a short plastic tube with syringe attached into the urogenital opening of the male and applying light suction with the syringe to draw the milt. The collected milt is diluted in water just prior to adding it to the eggs and the combination is gently stirred for about a minute to achieve fertilization. Fertilized eggs are adhesive and [[demersal]], therefore if incubation is to take place in a flow-through hatching jar, the eggs must be treated to prevent clumping.  Incubation usually takes anywhere from five to twelve days.&lt;ref name="Propagation"/&gt;

===Global commercial market===
[[File:Paddlefish caviar.png|thumb|260px|Tin of freshly processed paddlefish caviar|right]]
Advancements in biotechnology have created a global commercial market for the [[polyculture]] of American paddlefish.  In 1970, American paddlefish were stocked in several rivers in Europe and Asia. Introduction began when five thousand hatched larvae from Missouri hatcheries in the United States were exported to the former [[USSR]] for [[aquaculture|aquacultural]] utilization.&lt;ref name="Doiserbia"&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://www.doiserbia.nb.rs/img/doi/0354-4664/2006/0354-4664060327PL.pdf | publisher=Sinisa Stankovic Institute for Biological Research | title=First Record of the North American Paddlefish (''Polyodon spathula'', Walbaum 1792) in the Serbian Part of the Danube River | author=Mirjana Lenhardt | author2=A.

American paddlefish are now being raised in Ukraine, Germany, Austria, the Czech Republic, and the Plovdiv and Vidin regions in Bulgaria.  In May 2006, specimens of different sizes and weights were caught by professional fisherman near Prahovo in the Serbian part of the Danube River.&lt;ref name="Doiserbia"/&gt;

In 1988, fertilized American paddlefish eggs and larvae from Missouri hatcheries were first introduced into China.&lt;ref name="Doiserbia"/&gt;  Since that time, China imports approximately 4.5{{nbsp}}million fertilized eggs and larvae every year from hatcheries in Russia and the United States.  Some American paddlefish are polycultured in carp ponds and sold to restaurants while others are cultured for brood stock and caviar production.  China has also exported American paddlefish to Cuba, where they are farmed for caviar production.&lt;ref name="Mims"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://pdf.gaalliance.org/pdf/GAA-Mims-Feb06.pdf |publisher=The Global Aquaculture Alliance |title=Paddlefish Culture: Development Expanding Beyond U.S., Russia, China |author=Steven D.

===Sport fishing===
American paddlefish are a popular [[sport fish]] where their populations are sufficient to allow such activity.  Areas where there are no self-sustaining populations rely on state and federal restocking programs to maintain a viable fishery. A 2009 report includes the following states as allowing American paddlefish sport fishing per their respective state and federal regulations: Arkansas, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, North Dakota, Nebraska, Oklahoma, Montana, South Dakota and Tennessee.&lt;ref name="Status" /&gt;  Since American paddlefish are filter-feeders, they will not take bait or [[Fishing lure|lures]], and must be caught by snagging. The official state record in Kansas is a {{convert|144|lb|kg|abbr=on}} American paddlefish snagged in 2004; Montana, a {{convert|142.5|lb|kg|abbr=on}} American paddlefish snagged in 1973; and in North Dakota, a {{convert|130|lb|kg|abbr=on}} American paddlefish snagged in 2010.&lt;ref name="ND"/&gt;  The largest American paddlefish on record was captured in [[West Okoboji Lake]], Iowa in 1916 by a spear fisherman, and measured {{convert|85|in|m|abbr=on}} long, and weighed an estimated {{convert|198|lb|kg|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name="ND"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://siouxcityjournal.com/sports/recreation/outdoors/seeking-paddlefish-on-the-missouri/article_4f6f500e-867d-5eb3-86c6-eb877b937265.html |publisher=Sioux City Journal |title=Seeking paddlefish on the Missouri : Outdoors |date=October 11, 2012 |accessdate=December 12, 2014 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170824024506/http://siouxcityjournal.com/sports/recreation/outdoors/seeking-paddlefish-on-the-missouri/article_4f6f500e-867d-5eb3-86c6-eb877b937265.html |archivedate=August 24, 2017 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Population declines==
[[File:Angler has paddlefish by rostrum.png|thumbnail|260px|Angler landing a large paddlefish]]

===Overfishing and habitat destruction===
American paddlefish populations have declined dramatically, primarily as a result of overfishing and habitat destruction.  In 2004 they were listed as Vulnerable (VU A3de ver 3.1) on the [[IUCN Red List of Threatened Species]].  They are currently proposed for listing as VU 3de throughout their range as the result of a U.S. Fish &amp; Wildlife Service assessment.  The assessment concluded that "an overall population size reduction of at least 30% may occur within the next 10 years or three generations due to actual or potential levels of exploitation and the effects of introduced taxa, pollutants, competitors or parasites."&lt;ref name="IUCN"/&gt; American paddlefish are filter-feeding pelagic fish that require large, free-flowing rivers with braided channels, backwater areas, oxbow lakes that are rich in zooplankton, and gravel bars for spawning.&lt;ref name="MDC" /&gt;  Series of dams on rivers such as those constructed on the [[Missouri River]] have impounded large populations of American paddlefish, and blocked their upstream migration to spawning shoals.&lt;ref name="MDC" /&gt; [[River engineering#Channelization|Channelization]] and [[groynes]] or wing dykes have caused the narrowing of rivers and altered flow, destroying crucial spawning and nursery habitat.&lt;ref name="EWS" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Jennings"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Status" /&gt;  As a result, most impounded populations are not self-sustaining and must be stocked to maintain a viable sport fishery.&lt;ref name="MDC" /&gt;

===Zebra mussels===
[[Zebra mussel]] infestations in the Mississippi River,  Great Lakes and other Midwest rivers are also negatively affecting American paddlefish populations.  Zebra mussels are an [[invasive species]] well adapted for explosive population growth as a result of high rates of [[fecundity]] and recruitment.  As filter feeders, zebra mussels rely on plankton and can filter significant amounts of [[phytoplankton]] and zooplankton from the water, altering the availability of an important food source for paddlefish and native [[unionidae]].&lt;ref name="EWS"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ZM"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://home.nps.gov/mnrr/planyourvisit/upload/Zebra-mussel.pdf | publisher=National Park Service | title=Don't Move a Mussel | author=National Park Service | work=Missouri National Recreational River Zebra Mussel Bulletin | accessdate=June 21, 2014 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714130155/http://home.nps.gov/mnrr/planyourvisit/upload/Zebra-mussel.pdf | archivedate=July 14, 2014 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  A few days after the fertilization of zebra mussel eggs, a microscopic larva emerges called a [[veliger]].  During this initial stage of development, which usually lasts a few weeks, veligers are able to swim freely in the water column with other microscopic animals comprising zooplankton.  Veligers are poor swimmers, making them susceptible to predation by any animal that feeds on zooplankton.&lt;ref name=Biokids&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.biokids.umich.edu/critters/Dreissena_polymorpha/ | publisher = University of Michigan | title = ''Dreissena polymorpha'' | author = Tiffany Murphy | work = Animal Diversity Web | date = 2008 | accessdate = October 20, 2014 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20141030152522/http://www.biokids.umich.edu/critters/Dreissena_polymorpha/ | archivedate = October 30, 2014 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, natural predation of zebra mussels at any stage of development has not made a significant contribution to the long-term reduction of zebra mussel populations.&lt;ref name=TandF&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10641269709388593#.VE4w2b6k8f0 | publisher=CRC Press LLC | title=Natural Enemies of Zebra Mussels&amp;nbsp;— Predators, Parasites, and Ecological Competitors | author=Daniel P.

===Poaching===
[[Poaching]] has been a contributing factor to declining populations of American paddlefish in the states where they are commercially exploited, particularly while the demand for [[caviar]] remains strong.&lt;ref name="Status" /&gt; Since the 1980s, a trade [[embargo]] on [[Iran]] restricted imports of the highly sought after and most expensive [[beluga caviar]] from the [[Caspian Sea]], limiting U.S. sources of caviar.  The most sought after caviar is produced by sturgeons in the Northern Caspian Sea, but overfishing and poaching have exhausted the supply. American sturgeon and paddlefish populations were targeted as likely substitutes.&lt;ref name="LSU" /&gt;

The [[Fish roe|roe]] of American paddlefish can be processed into caviar similar in taste, color, size and texture to [[sevruga]] sturgeon caviar from the Caspian Sea.&lt;ref name=EWS /&gt;&lt;ref name="SRAC"/&gt;  Several cases of mislabeled American paddlefish roe sold as Caspian Sea caviar have been prosecuted by the [[U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service]] (USFWS).&lt;ref name="LSU"/&gt;  State and federal regulations restricting the harvest of American paddlefish populations in the wild, and the illegal trafficking of their roe are strictly enforced. Related violations such as the illegal transport of American paddlefish roe have resulted in convictions with substantial fines and prison sentences.&lt;ref name="FWSIndict"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.fws.gov/news/ShowNews.cfm?ID=07401D8C-0A8F-B153-D150CDEC1E8F306B | publisher=U.S. Fish &amp; Wildlife Service | title=Seven Men Indicted for Alleged Trafficking of Paddlefish Caviar | author=Gavin Shire | date=April 15, 2013 | accessdate=June 20, 2014 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140821175511/http://www.fws.gov/news/ShowNews.cfm?ID=07401D8C-0A8F-B153-D150CDEC1E8F306B | archivedate=August 21, 2014 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Tulsa"&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://www.tulsaworld.com/news/courts/man-gets-prison-term-in-paddlefish-caviar-criminal-case/article_6924b3e0-3866-11e3-be81-0019bb30f31a.html | publisher=John R.

'''Avida''' is an [[artificial life]] software platform to study the [[evolutionary biology]] of [[self-replication|self-replicating]] and [[evolution|evolving]] [[computer program]]s ([[digital organism]]s). Avida is under active development by [[Charles Ofria]]'s Digital Evolution Lab at [[Michigan State University]]; the first version of Avida was designed in 1993 by Ofria, [[Chris Adami]] and C. Titus Brown at [[Caltech]], and has been fully reengineered by Ofria on multiple occasions since then.  The software was originally inspired by the [[Tierra (computer simulation)|Tierra]] system.

== Design principles ==

[[Tierra (computer simulation)|Tierra]] simulated an evolutionary system by introducing computer programs that competed for computer resources, specifically processor (CPU) time and access to main memory. In this respect it was similar to [[Core Wars]], but differed in that the programs being run in the simulation were able to modify themselves, and thereby evolve. Tierra's programs were artificial life organisms.{{citation needed|date=February 2012}}

Unlike Tierra, Avida assigns every digital organism its own protected region of memory, and executes it with a separate virtual [[Central processing unit|CPU]]. By default, other digital organisms cannot access this memory space, neither for reading nor for writing, and cannot execute code that is not in their own memory space.

A second major difference is that the virtual CPUs of different organisms can run at different speeds, such that one organism executes, for example, twice as many instructions in the same time interval as another organism. The speed at which a virtual CPU runs is determined by a number of factors, but most importantly, by the ''tasks'' that the organism performs: logical computations that the organisms can carry out to reap extra CPU speed as bonus.

== Use in research ==

Adami and Ofria, in collaboration with others, have used Avida to conduct research in digital evolution, and the scientific journals ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' and ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'' have published four of their papers.

The 2003 paper "The Evolutionary Origin of Complex Features" describes the evolution of a mathematical [[Equality (mathematics)|equal]]s [[operator (programming)|operation]] from simpler bitwise operations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lenski|first1=R.

'''Cassius Baloyi''', (born on 5 November 1974 in [[Malamulele]], [[South Africa]]), is a retired professional [[boxing|boxer]].

==Professional career==
Known as "Mr. Shy Guy", Baloyi turned pro in 1994 and captured the Vacant IBF Super Featherweight Title in 2006 with a TKO win over [[Manuel Medina (boxer)|Manuel Medina]]. He lost the title in his first defense to [[Gairy St Clair]] later in the year, but regained the title by defeating compatriot Mzonke Fana on 12 April 2008. His most recent defense in September 2008 was against Javier Osvaldo Alvarez, whom he knocked down three times on the way to a TKO victory. On 12 April 2008, Baloyi lost his title to Malcolm Klassen when the referee stopped the fight during the seventh round after Klassen overpowered Baloyi. After the fight it was reported that Baloyi was disappointed with his trainer. Baloyi has retired from professional boxing and is now a Pro and Amateur boxing coach in Johannesburg.

Baloyi is the only South African to ever win 6 World Titles.
Baloyi was named "Boxer of the Year" for 2008 at the Boxing SA Annual Awards at a banquet held at Carnival City in [[Brakpan]].[http://www.fightnews.com/?p=4458]

[[Yasser Arafat]], who was the [[President of the Palestinian National Authority]] and [[Chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organization]], died unexpectedly on 11 November 2004, 75 years of age, after a short period of illness. The '''cause of Arafat's death''' has since been debated, although several different theories concerning it have been suggested.

==History of illness==
Arafat's illness began on 12 October 2004 with [[nausea]], [[vomiting]], [[abdominal pain]], and [[diarrhea]]. Soon afterward, his general health deteriorated.&lt;ref name=pmid24120205&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(13)61834-6 |pmid=24120205 |title=Improving forensic investigation for polonium poisoning |journal=The Lancet |volume=382 |issue=9900 |pages=1308 |year=2013 |last1=Froidevaux |first1=Pascal |last2=Baechler |first2=Sébastien |last3=Bailat |first3=Claude J |last4=Castella |first4=Vincent |last5=Augsburger |first5=Marc |last6=Michaud |first6=Katarzyna |last7=Mangin |first7=Patrice |last8=Bochud |first8=François O }}&lt;/ref&gt; Following visits by other doctors, including teams from Tunisia, Jordan, and Egypt, Arafat was taken to France on a French government jet, and was admitted to the [[Hôpital d'instruction des armées Percy]] in [[Clamart]], a suburb of Paris, on 29 October 2004.&lt;ref name=pmid24120205/&gt;&lt;ref name="Funeral"&gt;{{cite news|title=Arafat's funeral held in Cairo: Mystery illness |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/4005027.stm|first=Peter|last=Biles|publisher=BBC|date=12 November 2004|accessdate=2 November 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On admission, he was suffering from diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, and generalised abdominal pain, along with mild [[liver failure|liver]] and [[kidney failure]] linked to [[disseminated intravascular coagulation]].&lt;ref name=pmid24120205/&gt; His condition deteriorated with [[acute renal failure]], and, on 3 November, he lapsed into a gradually deepening coma.&lt;ref name=pmid24120205/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.volokh.com/posts/chain_1100148783.shtml|title=Arafat: If he is "brain-dead," he is dead|first=Jim|last=Lindgren|date=4 November 2004|work=The Volokh Conspiracy using passage published by France-Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A controversy erupted between officials of the PNA and [[Suha Arafat]] when officials from the PNA traveled to France to see Yasser Arafat. Suha stated, "They are trying to bury Abu Ammar [Arafat] alive".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Julie|last=Stahl|title='They're Trying to Bury My Husband Alive' Suha Arafat Says|url=http://www.cnsnews.com/ViewForeignBureaus.asp?Page=/ForeignBureaus/archive/200411/FOR20041108c.html|work=CNS News|publisher=Cybercast News Service|date=8 November 2004|accessdate=11 October 2007|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929103031/http://www.cnsnews.com/ViewForeignBureaus.asp?Page=%2FForeignBureaus%2Farchive%2F200411%2FFOR20041108c.html|archivedate=29 September 2007|deadurl=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Law of France|French law]] forbids physicians from discussing the condition of their patients with anybody, with the exception, in the case of a grave prognosis, of close relatives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/WAspad/UnArticleDeCode?commun=&amp;code=CSANPUNL.rcv&amp;art=L1110-4|title=Code of Public Health|date=5 March 2002|publisher=Legifrance|language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt; Accordingly, all communications concerning Arafat's health had to be authorized by his wife.

==Death==
[[File:Mausoleo Arafat (Muqata, Ramallah) 02.JPG|thumb|right|Arafat mausoleum]]

Arafat was pronounced incapacitated on 11 November 2004 at 03:30&amp;nbsp;[[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]] at the age of 75 of what French doctors called a massive haemorrhagic [[cerebrovascular accident]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://s3.documentcloud.org/documents/393851/hospitalization-report-english.pdf |title=Hospitalization|publisher=D Cloud|accessdate=28 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=AP-exhume&gt;{{cite news|url=http://bigstory.ap.org/article/palestinians-ready-exhume-arafat-body-tests |title=New tests revive debate over Arafat death |publisher=Associated Press|date=4 July 2012|accessdate=27 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the underlying infection was declared unknown.&lt;ref name=NYT&gt;{{cite news|title=Medical records say Arafat died from a stroke|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/09/08/international/middleeast/08arafat.html?_r=1&amp;pagewanted=all|accessdate=12 July 2012|newspaper=The New York Times|date=8 September 2005|author=Steven Erlanger|author2=Lawrence K.

The ''[[Le Canard enchaîné|Canard Enchaîné]]'' newspaper reported alleged leaks of information by unnamed medical sources at Percy hospital that had access to Arafat and his medical file. According to the newspaper, the doctors at Percy hospital suspected, from Arafat's arrival, grave lesions of the liver responsible for an alteration of the composition of the blood; Arafat was therefore placed in a [[hematology]] service. [[Leukemia]] was "soundly ruled out". According to the same source, the reason why this diagnosis of [[cirrhosis]] could not be made available was that, in the mind of the general public, cirrhosis is generally associated with the consequences of alcohol abuse. Even though the diagnosis was not of alcoholic cirrhosis and Arafat was not known for consuming any alcohol, there was a likelihood of rumors. The source explained that Arafat's living conditions did little to improve the situation. Thus, according to the source, the probable causes of the disease were multiple; Arafat's coma was a consequence of the worsened cirrhosis. The French newspaper ''[[Le Monde]]'' quoted doctors as saying that he suffered from "an unusual blood disease and a liver problem".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Palestinians head to Paris to probe Arafat's death |url=http://www.despardes.com/oscartango/111704.html |work=Oscar-Tango |publisher=Despardes Inc. |date=17 November 2004 |accessdate=26 September 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070404023909/http://www.despardes.com/oscartango/111704.html |archivedate=4 April 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After Arafat's death, the [[Minister of Defence (France)|French Ministry of Defence]] said that Arafat's medical file would be transmitted to only his [[next of kin]]. It was determined that Arafat's nephew and PNA envoy to the UN, [[Nasser al-Qudwa]], was a close enough relative, thus working around Suha Arafat's silence on her husband's illness. Nasser al-Qudwa was given a copy of Arafat's 558-page medical file by the French Ministry of Defence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Arafat doctors found 'no poison':Tests on Yasser Arafat's body showed no traces of any known poisons, according to medical files released on Monday. |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/4032257.stm|publisher=BBC News|date=22 November 2004|accessdate=2 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theories about the cause of death==
[[File:Yasser Arafat's tombstone.jpg|thumb|right|Palestinian honor guard stationed at Arafat's temporary tomb in Ramallah]]
There are numerous theories about the cause of Arafat's death. Initially Arafat records were withheld by senior Palestinian officials. In 2004, Palestinian Foreign Minister Nabil Shaath has said after talks with Arafat's French doctors that they had "ruled out completely poison". However, Shaath recently stated in "The Price of Kings",  a documentary on Arafat's leadership, "I have no doubt that he was assassinated. The French said that whatever toxic material was in his body did not test positive in their toxicology table, saying in plain words "this was a poison we did not have in our laboratories."&lt;ref&gt;https://www.spiritlevelfilm.com/thepriceofkings/landingb/ {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130601032941/http://www.spiritlevelfilm.com/thepriceofkings/landingb/# |date=1 June 2013 }}{{full citation needed|date=February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Al-Kurdi, Arafat's personal physician for 18 years, said "I would usually be summoned to attend to Arafat immediately, even when all he had was a simple cold ... But when his medical situation was really deteriorating, they chose not to call me at all", and Arafat's wife, Suha, refused to allow him to visit Arafat in the private Paris hospital where he was being treated. Later he was denied access to Arafat's body after his death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Rubinstein|first=Danny|url=http://www.haaretz.com/news/arafat-s-doctor-there-was-hiv-in-his-blood-but-poison-killed-him-1.227303|title=Arafat's doctor: There was HIV in his blood, but poison killed him |publisher=Haaretz|date=12 August 2007|accessdate=28 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Al-Kurdi also lamented that Arafat's widow Suha had refused an autopsy, which he said would have answered many questions regarding cause of death.&lt;ref name="Al-Kurdi Claims"&gt;{{cite news|first=Danny|last=Rubenstein|authorlink=Danny Rubenstein |url=http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/pages/ShArt.jhtml?itemNo=892231&amp;contrassID=1&amp;subContrassID=1|title=Arafat's doctor: There was HIV in his blood, but poison killed him|date=8 September 2005|work=Haaretz}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Steven|last=Erlanger|author2=Lawrence K.

Medical records released in 2005 showed that Arafat's doctors could not agree on the cause of death, stating that he died from a stroke that stemmed from an unknown condition. Analysis based on those records suggested him dying from poisoning, AIDS, or an infection.&lt;ref name="AIDS"/&gt;&lt;ref name="MSNBC"&gt;{{cite news|title=Arafat's doctor wants autopsy|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/6472056/ |agency=Associated Press|date=12 November 2004|accessdate=12 December 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, newly released medical records revealed that French doctors initially diagnosed Arafat with gastroenteritis.&lt;ref name=Telegraph&gt;{{cite news|title=Yasser Arafat medical records show health was blamed on gastroenteritis|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/middleeast/palestinianauthority/9396397/Yasser-Arafat-medical-records-show-health-was-blamed-on-gastroenteritis.html|accessdate=12 July 2012|newspaper=The Telegraph|date=12 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===AIDS===
In September 2005, based on obtained Arafat records, an Israeli [[HIV/AIDS|AIDS]] expert claimed that Arafat bore all the symptoms of AIDS, while ''[[The New York Times]]'' claimed it was highly unlikely that Arafat died from AIDS.&lt;ref name="AIDS"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/4225332.stm |title=Cause of Arafat death 'unknown' Medical records of former Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat appear to show that doctors could not determine the underlying cause of his death|date=8 September 2005 |publisher=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[John Loftus (author)|John Loftus]] reported on ABC radio that Arafat had died of AIDS. According to Loftus, the [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] had knowledge of his condition, and convinced Israel not to assassinate him and wait for his inevitable death of the disease, since the subsequent widespread connotations of the disease with homosexuality would discredit him.&lt;ref name=McDermott&gt;{{Cite book|title=Presidential leadership, illness, and decision making|last=McDermott|first=Rose|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2008|isbn=978-0-521-88272-9|page=244|postscript=&lt;!-- Bot inserted parameter. Either remove it; or change its value to "." for the cite to end in a ".", as necessary. --&gt;{{inconsistent citations}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; Arafat's personal doctor for 18 years, Dr. Ashraf Al-Kurdi, said Arafat suffered from AIDS.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=palestinian arafat died of H.I.V (AIDS), DR al-kurdi. أبو عمار|website=[[YouTube]]|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZCoW7Sagti8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However an article published in a number of American news publications rejected the assertion that Arafat had AIDS, stating, "An Israeli infectious disease specialist said he would have performed the test, if only to be thorough and to refute the rumors that surrounded the case. He said news accounts during Arafat's illness made him strongly suspect that Arafat had AIDS. But after studying the records, he said that was improbable, given the sudden onset of the intestinal troubles", though AIDS-associated opportunistic infections such as [[cryptosporidiosis]] can begin in this way. This same article also states that it is "highly unlikely" that Arafat had died from poisoning, and further asserts that Arafat had died from a stroke linked to an "underlying infection."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.sfgate.com/2005-09-08/news/17388635_1_medical-records-percy-army-teaching-hospital-unexplained-death-last-year|work=The San Francisco Chronicle|title=Best Books Of 2003|first1=Steven|last1=Erlanger|first2=Lawrence K.|last2=Altman|date=8 September 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/09/08/international/middleeast/08arafat.html?_r=2&amp;n=Top%2FReference%2FTimes%20Topics%2FSubjects%2FP%2FPoisoning%20and%20Poisons&amp;pagewanted=print|work=The New York Times| title=Medical Records Say Arafat Died From a Stroke|first1=Steven|last1=Erlanger|first2=Lawrence K.|last2=Altman|date=8 September 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===High-tech laser===
In 2005, Palestinian ambassador to [[Sri Lanka]] Attalah Quiba alleged that Arafat was killed by two Israelis with a high-tech [[laser]], and the two Israelis attempted to flee but were "wrestled down by Palestinian Security personnel". Quiba also alleged that 16 countries had tested the blood of Arafat, and determined that Arafat was poisoned through "high technology".&lt;ref name="Fox 35"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,151209,00.html|title=An End to the 35-hour French Workweek|publisher=Fox News Channel|date=22 March 2005|accessdate=20 September 2012|author=Levine, Michael}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gastroenteritis===
New medical records that were released in July 2012 showed that Arafat's condition was initially diagnosed as viral [[gastroenteritis]] by his Arab doctors who took care of him in the [[West Bank]] in the [[Mukataa]] before he was airlifted to France, although his condition later improved and he even joined in the fast of [[Ramadan]]. However, there was persistent vomiting and diarrhea, Arafat began feeling weaker, and his blood platelet count dropped. On 28 October, his medical team decided to send him abroad, and he was flown to France the next morning.&lt;ref name="TelegraphGastro"&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/middleeast/palestinianauthority/9396397/Yasser-Arafat-medical-records-show-health-was-blamed-on-gastroenteritis.html|title=Yasser Arafat medical records show health was blamed on gastroenteritis|work=The Telegraph|date=12 July 2012| accessdate=15 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="APGastro"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5g1ple-ADLrr_vMRu6EP5Lyzm4XXw?docId=8b152bbe62d3498da9b15012fcaf6c56|title=New Arafat medical file released in death probe|agency=Associated Press |date=12 July 2012|accessdate=15 July 2012|author=Laub, Karin}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dr Joseph Zimmerman, an Israeli specialist who reviewed the Ramallah medical file said Arafat's early symptoms were not consistent with viral gastroenteritis, and did not believe that type of viral infection would lead to death. He also said that poisoning appeared unlikely, even by a radioactive substance such as polonium-210. He reminded people that Arafat's platelet counts dropped suddenly and stayed low, and that Arafat eventually exhibited signs of liver dysfunction, which could have been caused by a bacterial infection, but is not typical of poisoning.&lt;ref name="TelegraphGastro"/&gt;&lt;ref name="APGastro"/&gt;

===Platelet disorder===
A report by the French doctors who treated him states that a [[platelet]] disorder caused Arafat's death. The cause of this platelet disorder is unknown, although poison is a possibility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Family: Platelet disorder killed Arafat|url=http://www.maannews.net/eng/ViewDetails.aspx?ID=435849|agency=[[Ma'an News Agency]]|date=11 October 2011|accessdate=4 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Poisoning===
In 2004, Palestinian Foreign Minister Nabil Shaath said after talks with Arafat's French doctors that they had "ruled out completely poison".&lt;ref name="MSNBC"/&gt; A 2005 article in ''[[The New York Times]]'' said that based on his records it was highly unlikely that Arafat died from poisoning.&lt;ref name="AIDS"/&gt; Meanwhile, al-Kurdi called for the creation of an independent commission to carry out investigations concerning Arafat's suspicious death, stating, "any doctor would tell you that these are the symptoms of a poisoning".&lt;ref name="Al-Kurdi Claims"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Amnon|last=Kapeliouk|title=Yasser Arafat a-t-il été assassiné?

Former Knesset member, peace activist and personal friend of Arafat [[Uri Avnery]] claimed at the time of Arafat's death that he had been poisoned, and repeated the claim in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;[[Uri Avnery]],[http://www.counterpunch.org/2012/07/06/poisoning-arafat/ Poisoning Arafat], at [[CounterPunch]], 6–8 July 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Another "senior Israeli physician" claimed in an article in ''[[Haaretz]]'' that it was "a classic case of food poisoning", probably caused by a meal eaten four hours before he fell ill that may have contained a toxin such as [[ricin]], rather than a standard bacterial poisoning. However, in the same week as the report in ''Haaretz'', ''The New York Times'' published a separate report, also based on access to Arafat's medical records, which claimed that it was highly unlikely that Arafat had [[Foodborne illness|food poisoning]].&lt;ref name="AIDS"/&gt;&lt;ref name="MSNBC"/&gt;

====Poisoning with thallium====
In 2009, [[Bassam Abu Sharif]], Arafat's former advisor, alleged that [[Mossad]], the national intelligence agency of Israel, had poisoned Arafat by a lethal dose of [[Thallium poisoning|thallium]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.maannews.net/eng/ViewDetails.aspx?ID=349911 ''Arafat's aide: New information on president's death''], Ma'an News Agency, 10 January 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; a rare chemical whose effects are difficult to trace,&lt;ref name="AA"/&gt; via Arafat's daily medications. Abu Sharif alleged that the [[Israel Defense Forces]] (IDF) had held the driver of a Palestinian ambulance that brought him his medications, for a minimum of 30 minutes while the IDF searched it. According to Abu Sharif, this incident would have allowed Israel to replace Arafat's medications with poison.&lt;ref name="Bassam Abu Sharif's claim about poisoning"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aljazeerah.info/News/2009/July/21%20n/Israeli%20Mossad%20poisoned%20Arafat%20through%20his%20medications,%20says%20Bassam%20Abu%20Sharif.htm |title=Israeli Mossad poisoned Arafat through his medications|date=22 July 2009|work=Al-Jazeerah}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his book ''Arafat and the Dream of Palestine: An Insider's Account'', Abu Sarif wrote, "I was positive they were poisoning his food on a daily basis and doing it right under our very eyes."&lt;ref name="Abu Sharif"&gt;{{cite book|title=Arafat and the Dream of Palestine: An Insider's Account|publisher=Macmillan|author=Abu Sharif, Bassam|year=2009|page=251|isbn=0230608019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, Abu Sarif alleged that an investigation conducted by "the most prominent forensic toxicology expert in the UK" had revealed that thallium was responsible for poisoning Arafat. According to Abu Sharif, European toxicology experts are not familiar with thallium and only this forensic toxicology expert could have identified the thallium. However, Abu Sharif did not reveal the names of the expert or the institution responsible for the research.&lt;ref name="AA"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alarabiya.net/articles/2011/01/11/133028.html| title=Arafat death caused by rare poison: top adviser|publisher=Al Arabiya|date=11 January 2011|accessdate=20 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a result of Abu Sharif's allegations, the delegates at the August 2009 Fatah convention in [[Bethlehem]] voted for a resolution which blamed Israel for poisoning Yasser Arafat. An editorial in ''[[The Jerusalem Post]]'' questioned the legitimacy of Abu Sharif's allegations, noting that "nobody asked how Abu Sharif came to possess this information, whether he can back it up or why he chose to divulge it so late".&lt;ref name="JPost edit"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jpost.com/Opinion/Editorials/Article.aspx?id=276287|title=Arafat's death|work=The Jerusalem Post|date=4 July 2012|accessdate=20 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; A leader of Fatah and a nephew of Arafat said that an investigation indicated a "high possibility of poisoning" but that there was not any proof.&lt;ref name="NYT fatah"&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/11/world/middleeast/11fatah.html?_r=0|title=Fatah Turns to Nation Building, Though It Doesn't Discard the Rifle|work=The New York Times|date=10 August 2009|accessdate=20 September 2012|author=Kershner, Isabel}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Poisoning with polonium====
According to Israel Radio, a former Palestinian intelligence officer, attorney Fahmi Shabana, said that Yasser Arafat's political rivals were responsible for his death, and that he was poisoned with [[polonium]]. Shabana, who took part in the investigation into Arafat's death in a French hospital in 2004, also said that several months after his death, the same cell murdered the head of military intelligence in [[Gaza City|Gaza]], General [[Moussa Arafat]], a relative of the PLO leader, in order to prevent a blood feud. The lawyer called on Palestinian Authority president [[Mahmoud Abbas]] to reopen the investigation into Arafat's death."&lt;ref&gt;[[Kol Yisrael]] English news, 17 January 2011, 0430 [[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.aljazeera.net/news/pages/676ce5b7-f085-45d4-9c97-5c7a32864c06|title=الأخبار - ضابط فلسطيني: خصوم عرفات قتلوه عربي|publisher=Al Jazeera|date=17 January 2011|accessdate=28 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On ''[[Newsnight]]'' on UK TV on 21 January 2016, during a feature on the 2006 assassination of [[Alexander Litvinienko]], [[George Galloway]] claimed to have been with Yasser Arafat in Paris when he died of polonium-210 poisoning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode |title=George Galloway and Alex Goldfarb on Litvinenko inquiry |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0om8ii5XVs&amp;t=113 |series=[[Newsnight]] |network=[[BBC Television|BBC]] |date=21 January 2016 |time=1:53 |access-date=28 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Al Jazeera's investigation=====
On 4 July 2012, [[Al Jazeera]] reported that a nine-month investigation by Al Jazeera had revealed that none of the causes of Arafat's death suggested in several rumors were true, as Arafat was in good health until he suddenly fell ill on 12 October 2004. Tests carried out by the ''Institut de Radiophysique'' (Institute of Radiation Physics) at the [[University of Lausanne]] in [[Switzerland]] found traces of polonium, a rare, highly [[radioactive decay|radioactive]] element, on Arafat's personal belongings, which suggested that there was a high level of polonium inside his body when he died. The lethal element was found in quantities much higher than could occur naturally, and further, that 60%–80% of that polonium (depending on the item being tested) had not come from natural sources.&lt;ref name=AJ_widow_calls&gt;[http://www.aljazeera.com/programmes/whatkilledarafat/2012/07/20127383653774794.html "Arafat's widow calls for body to be exhumed"].

BBC, 4 July 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2010, an official press release from the Institut de Radiophysique, where those items were analyzed, had stated that:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"an unexplained quantity of Polonium-210 has been detected on the personal effects of Mr. Arafat. However, this is not sufficient to determine the causes of death. In particular, it will be recalled that, contrary to what happened in the case of the former Russian spy [[Alexander Litvinenko]], Mr. Arafat did not lose his hair, and some of the findings in the forensic report are inconsistent with an acute radiation syndrome."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.chuv.ch/ira/ira_home/actu-xml-list/actueve_detail.htm?id=3278 |title=Institut de radiophysique |publisher=[[University Hospital of Lausanne|University Hospital of Lausanne (CHUV)]] |date=14 October 2010 |accessdate=28 January 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130118203653/http://www.chuv.ch/ira/ira_home/actu-xml-list/actueve_detail.htm?id=3278 |archivedate=18 January 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In July 2012, a spokesman for the Institut de Radiophysique stressed that the "clinical symptoms described in Arafat's medical reports were not consistent with polonium-210 and that conclusions could not be drawn as to whether the Palestinian leader was poisoned or not", and that "the only way to confirm the findings would be to exhume Arafat's body to test it for polonium-210".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Bart|first=Katharina|date=3 July 2012|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2012/07/03/us-palestinians-arafat-idUSBRE8621CL20120703|title=Swiss institute finds polonium in Arafat's effects|agency=Reuters}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Arafat poisoned by polonium: report|url=https://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5gC3BrMO_aYwFIwTAtXLsWoQnAing?docId=CNG.b427100ac45d92b76358ffa0029eb52a.261|agency=Agence France-Presse|date=2 July 2012|accessdate=2 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; François Bochud, who heads the Institute of Radiation Physics in Lausanne, Switzerland, stated that "our results are clearly not a proof of any poisoning".&lt;ref name=AP-exhume/&gt; Alastair Hay, professor of environmental toxicology at the University of Leeds in England, stated: "You don't know much about the provenance of the clothing and whether it had been tampered with later on. You'd want to test the body."&lt;ref name=AP-exhume/&gt;

In response to Al Jazeera's report, Dr [[Ely Karmon]], at [[International Institute for Counter-Terrorism|Herzliya's Institute for Counterterrorism]], a specialist in chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear terrorism, said that "the half-life of the substance [i.e., slightly more than 138 days 9 hours] would make it impossible for polonium to have been discovered at such high levels if it had been used to kill Arafat eight years ago. If it had been used for poisoning, minimal levels should be seen now. Yet much higher levels were found. Someone planted the polonium much later." He went on to question why Arafat's widow, Suha Arafat, who provided the researchers with Arafat's belongings was not also poisoned while she was by his side at the hospital touching him and his clothing.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jpost.com/MiddleEast/Article.aspx?id=276447 Polonium found on Arafat's clothing was planted], ''The Jerusalem Post'', 5 July 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

Israel has denied any connection to the rumours. Deputy Spokesman of [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Israel)|Israeli Foreign Ministry]] Paul Hirschson was skeptical of the rumours, joking, "All of a sudden, Suha's checking her wash basket and discovered clothes that weren't washed for eight years. Suddenly, out of nowhere a couple of garments turn up; we test them, and presto! There's Polonium." Avi Dichter, who was in charge of the Shin Bet when Arafat died, told Army radio that "Yasser Arafat had many enemies, domestically, abroad. But let them investigate. ... The Palestinians know well how to investigate what goes on in their house. Let them investigate and find out."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/world/2012-07/05/c_131697980.htm|title=Israeli officials deny Arafat poisoning rumors|publisher=Xinhua|date=5 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 12 October 2013, the British medical journal ''[[The Lancet]]'' published a peer-reviewed article titled "Improving forensic investigation for polonium poisoning".&lt;ref name=pmid24120205/&gt; In the article, a group of Swiss doctors suggested that Arafat could have died of polonium poisoning. The team analysed 38 samples of Arafat's clothes and belongings and 37 reference samples which were known to be polonium-free. Several of the Arafat samples were notably more radioactive than the controls, but not all. The team believed that an autopsy could be useful in this case. After testing Arafat's personal belongings and samples of his body fluids, the chief of the Federal Medical-Biological Agency of Russia, Vladimir Uiba, concluded that polonium was not the cause of his death,&lt;ref name="ansamed.info"&gt;http://www.ansamed.info/ansamed/en/news/sections/generalnews/2013/10/15/Arafat-Russia-rules-death-caused-polonium-poisoning_9462946.html{{full citation needed|date=February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the Agency then denied that Uiba's comments were official.&lt;ref name=Reuters_Arafat_poisoned&gt;[http://www.haaretz.com/news/middle-east/1.556656 "Swiss team: Arafat poisoned to death with polonium"]. Reuters/''Haaretz'', 6 November 2013&lt;/ref&gt; British forensic scientist Professor David Barclay said the Swiss team's findings were a "smoking gun", and that it was "absolutely certain" that polonium had been the cause of his death.&lt;ref name=Reuters_Arafat_poisoned/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Yasser Arafat: Tests 'Support' Polonium Claims |url=http://news.sky.com/story/1164820/yasser-arafat-tests-support-polonium-claims |accessdate=6 November 2013 |publisher=[[Sky News]] |date=6 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the results of the French and Russian tests became public, David Barclay did not comment or communicate any more on the case.

The French tests found some polonium but stated it was from "natural environmental origin".&lt;ref name="wtop.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wtop.com/220/3531404/Russia-Arafats-death-not-caused-by-radiation |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-12-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131230234655/http://www.wtop.com/220/3531404/Russia-Arafats-death-not-caused-by-radiation |archivedate=30 December 2013 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Later the Russian tests released in December 2013 found that Arafat's death was not caused by radiation. [[Vladimir Uiba]], the head of the Russian Federal Medical and Biological Agency, stated that Yasser had died of natural causes and they had no plans to conduct further tests.&lt;ref name="wtop.com"/&gt;

=====Call for new investigation=====

Following Al Jazeera's revelations, [[Suha Arafat]], Arafat's widow, called for the exhumation of Arafat's body for further testing, in response to the [[Al Jazeera]] story about [[polonium]].&lt;ref name=AJ_widow_calls/&gt; In response, Abbas ordered a committee to be formed, and stated that there were no religious or political obstacles to exhuming the body.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://english.wafa.ps/index.php?action=detail&amp;id=20203|title=WAFA - Abbas Orders Committee to Investigate Arafat's Death|access-date=12 July 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131112134732/http://english.wafa.ps/index.php?action=detail&amp;id=20203#|archive-date=12 November 2013|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Nimr Hamad, an aide to Abbas, stated that a team of experts would first be sent to [[Europe]] to learn more from the Swiss institute and from the French military hospital where Arafat died. Abbas stated that he would only order an autopsy if the family agreed, but did not define whom in the family he meant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/aide-palestinian-leader-arafat-16715648 |title=International News|publisher=ABC|date=24 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, Abbas stated that they would only investigate "if necessary".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.jpost.com/Health/Article.aspx?id=276549|title=Abbas: We'll open new Arafat probe|publisher=JPost|date=11 November 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tawfiq Tirawi, the head of the committee in charge of investigating Arafat's death, stated: "We are certain that there are Palestinian hands that contributed to the elimination of Yasser Arafat." With regards to those people, Tirawi stated that they "will be subject to severe penalties and doomed to death".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.palpress.co.uk/arabic/?action=detail&amp;id=54114|title=وكالة فلسطين برس للأنباء|publisher=Palpress}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 30 July 2012, Tirawi added, "We haven't initiated the investigation based on the hypothesis that Arafat was killed by poison, but we agreed to begin an investigation searching directly for the killer regardless of the medical reports which will eventually show the method of killing and name of the toxin."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.maannews.net/eng/ViewDetails.aspx?ID=508459|title=Arafat inquiry like looking for 'needle in the ocean'|publisher=MAAN|accessdate=28 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tunisia also requested that the [[Arab League]] convene a ministerial meeting to discuss Arafat's death and study the circumstances in which he died.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Harel|first=Amos |url=http://www.haaretz.com/news/middle-east/tunisia-requests-arab-league-meeting-over-suspicions-arafat-murdered-1.449067|title=Tunisia requests Arab League meeting over suspicions Arafat murdered|publisher=Haaretz|date=5 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Arab League Secretary-General [[Nabil Elaraby]] stated that a permanent representative meeting would be held to discuss Arafat's death, and that permanent representatives would prepare a report and raise proposals over necessary action, which they would present in the soonest Arab League ministerial meeting.&lt;ref name="aljazeera"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/news/europe/2012/07/2012710211321389670.html|title=Arafat's widow seeks French probe into death |publisher=Al Jazeera|date=10 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Exhumation of Arafat's remains==
On 9 July 2012, Palestinian Authority President [[Mahmoud Abbas]] approved the exhumation of Arafat's body in response to the [[Al Jazeera]] story about [[polonium]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Khadder|first=Kareem|title=Palestinian leader signs off on Arafat exhumation, PLO official says|url=http://www.cnn.com/2012/07/09/world/meast/mideast-arafat-exhumation/index.html|publisher=CNN|accessdate=9 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 8 August 2012, Swiss experts were invited to the West Bank to prepare for the examination of Yasser Arafat's remains to investigate possible poisoning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Daraghmeh|first=Mohammed|title=Swiss experts invited to conduct Arafat Autopsy|url=http://hosted.ap.org/dynamic/stories/A/ARAFATS_DEATH?SITE=AP&amp;SECTION=HOME&amp;TEMPLATE=DEFAULT&amp;CTIME=2012-08-08-12-29-45|agency=Associated Press|accessdate=8 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The lab said that they wanted guarantees that the investigation would not be used for political purposes, saying, "Meanwhile, our main concern is to guarantee the independence, the credibility and the transparency of any involvement that we may have."&lt;ref name="Lab politics"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.jpost.com/International/Article.aspx?id=280602|title=Swiss lab wants guarantee in Arafat death inquiry|work=The Jerusalem Post|agency=Reuters|date=9 August 2012|accessdate=9 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 27 November 2012, three teams of international investigators collected samples from Arafat's body and the surrounding soil in the mausoleum in [[Ramallah]]. A French, a Swiss and a Russian team have independently investigated the samples.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aljazeera.com/news/middleeast/2012/11/2012112795443645353.html "Yasser Arafat's body exhumed in Ramallah"].

Publication of the results of the studies was delayed, reportedly on the request of the Palestinian Authority, which feared they could have negative impact on the peace talks.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jpost.com/Middle-East/Experts-late-with-test-results-in-Arafat-death-case-327627 "Experts late with test results in Arafat death case"]. Khaled abu Toameh, ''Jerusalem Post'', 2 October 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

On 6 November 2013, Al Jazeera reported that the Swiss forensic team had found levels of polonium in Arafat's ribs and pelvis 18 times higher than normal, and were 83%  confident that polonium poisoning had occurred, but Professor Bochud disagreed with this interpretation by Al Jazeera and only stated that the poisoning hypothesis by polonium was "moderately supported".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.aljazeera.com/investigations/killing-arafat/qa-francois-bochud-arafat-report-2013117184743478799.html{{full citation needed|date=February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a journalist from the Swiss daily newspaper [[Le Temps]], Luis Lema, the Swiss experts had concluded that on a probability scale ranging from one to six, death by polonium poisoning was around five &lt;ref name=LT24.05.14/&gt;. 

Arafat's widow Suha stated her belief that he was a victim of a "political assassination" but refrained from finger-pointing and said she would await the French forensic results.&lt;ref name=Reuters_Arafat_poisoned/&gt;&lt;ref name=Guardianpolonium&gt;Angelique Chrisafis, Harriet Sherwood,[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/nov/06/yasser-arafat-poisoned-polonium-tests-scientists'Yasser Arafat may have been poisoned with polonium, tests show,'] ''The Guardian'', 6 November 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;David Poort and Ken Silverstein,[http://www.aljazeera.com/investigations/killing-arafat/swiss-study-polonium-found-arafats-bones-201311522578803512.html 'Swiss study: Polonium found in Arafat's bones,'] al-Jazeera, 6 November 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Joods Actueel]], a Belgian monthly newspaper, claimed that most experts in forensics disagreed that the results were consistent with polonium poisoning and that the conclusions of the Swiss study were not in line with the results obtained.&lt;ref&gt;[http://joodsactueel.be/2013/11/19/deskundigen-maken-brandhout-van-zwitsers-rapport-na-vraag-belgische-onderzoeker/ Is the "Arafat was poisoned" hypothesis "moderately" supported by the Swiss report, "strongly wrong"?]&lt;/ref&gt;

Forensic biologist Nathan Lents of the [[John Jay College of Criminal Justice]] said the report's results were consistent with a possible polonium poisoning, but "There's certainly not a smoking gun here."

Derek Hill, a professor in radiological science at [[University College London]] who was not involved in the investigation, said: "I would say it's clearly not overwhelming proof, and there is a risk of contamination (of the samples), but it is a pretty strong signal. ... It seems likely what they're doing is putting a very cautious interpretation of strong data."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://bigstory.ap.org/article/al-jazeera-reports-evidence-arafat-poisoning |title=Possible evidence of Arafat poisoning is reported |publisher=Associated Press|date=6 November 2013|accessdate=27 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the testing of Arafat's remains by the Russian team, the Russian Medical-Biological Agency concluded that polonium was not the cause of his death.&lt;ref name="ansamed.info"/&gt; However, the government scientific body later denied that it had made any official statement about the research, saying only that it had handed its results to the Russian Foreign Ministry.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.msn.com/world/russian-official-rules-out-arafat-polonium-poisoning?ocid=msnnws Arafat: Russia rules out death caused by polonium poisoning]. ANSA, 15 October 2013&lt;/ref&gt; However, Al Jazeera found that the Russian scientists had only investigated four out of 20 samples, being the samples that were unlikely to show the amount of radioactive exposure. The scientists also appear to have been restricted by the Russian Foreign Ministry in how to present the report. According to Al Jazeera's source, "Russia's goal was to fulfill the Palestinian Authority's request, not offend Israel by helping the PA, and not create a new hotbed in the Middle East".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aljazeera.com/investigations/killing-arafat/experts-question-russian-arafat-findings-2013118102237239238.html "Experts question Russian Arafat findings"], Al Jazeera, 8 November 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2013, an unidentified person leaked what were claimed to be the results of the French investigation to [[Agence France-Presse|AFP]], saying that "the report rules out the poisoning theory and goes in the sense of a natural death".&lt;ref name="afp-leak"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.afp.com/en/news/topstories/arafat-was-not-poisoned-say-french-experts|title=Arafat 'was not poisoned' say French experts|date=2013-12-03|agency=AFP|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131204022408/http://www.afp.com/en/news/topstories/arafat-was-not-poisoned-say-french-experts|archivedate=2013-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the leaker, the report says Arafat died of a "generalised infection".&lt;ref name="bbc-leak"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-25205170|title=Yasser Arafat 'was not poisoned' - leaked French report|publisher=BBC News|date=2013-12-03|author=Fraser, Christian|accessdate=2013-12-04|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203180722/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-25205170|archivedate=2013-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; On December 4, Al Jazeera quoted Suha Arafat speaking at a press conference after having received the French report: "Is it the poisoned body that would have contaminated the environment outside? Or is it the opposite? The first one is the conclusion of the Swiss. The Swiss think that the body was poisoned and contaminated the environment. And the French reach the opposite conclusion—that it's actually the environment outside which explains the presence of polonium 210."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aljazeera.com/news/europe/2013/12/french-experts-rule-out-arafat-poisoning-2013123145211499109.html Al Jazeera: French Experts Rule Out Arafat Poisoning]&lt;/ref&gt; Later that same month, a Russian investigative team from the Federal Medico-Biological Agency agreed that Arafat did not die from poisoning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/reuters/2013/12/26/world/europe/26reuters-arafat-death-russia.html|title=Russia Says Arafat Died of Natural Causes: Interfax|date=26 December 2013|work=New York Times|agency=Reuters|accessdate=26 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike the Swiss report, the French and Russian reports were not made public, at the time.&lt;ref name=LT24.05.14&gt;{{fr}} Luis Lema, [http://www.letemps.ch/Page/Uuid/afa176fe-e2a3-11e3-a6a0-66e041ce382a/Yasser_Arafat_la_valse_des_isotopes "Yasser Arafat, la valse des isotopes"], ''[[Le Temps]]'', Saturday 24 May 2014, p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; The French later announced that foul play was not involved.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/mar/16/yasser-arafat-french-rule-out-foul-play Yasser Arafat: French rule out foul play in former Palestinian leader's death]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Lausanne University Hospital|CHUV]] published in February 2016 a paper in [[Science Direct]] to justify their conclusions. They admitted: "The evidences gathered during this expert report are not clear-cut: we cannot exclude &lt;sup&gt;210&lt;/sup&gt;Po as a cause of death, but we cannot be sure that &lt;sup&gt;210&lt;/sup&gt;Po was the cause of death."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.forsciint.2015.09.019 |pmid=26707208 |title=210Po poisoning as possible cause of death: Forensic investigations and toxicological analysis of the remains of Yasser Arafat |journal=Forensic Science International |volume=259 |pages=1–9 |year=2016 |last1=Froidevaux |first1=Pascal |last2=Bochud |first2=François |last3=Baechler |first3=Sébastien |last4=Castella |first4=Vincent |last5=Augsburger |first5=Marc |last6=Bailat |first6=Claude |last7=Michaud |first7=Katarzyna |last8=Straub |first8=Marietta |last9=Pecchia |first9=Marco |last10=Jenk |first10=Theo M. |last11=Uldin |first11=Tanya |last12=Mangin |first12=Patrice }}&lt;/ref&gt;
In an other document the CHUV explains "...these results do not then define the probability to which Yasser Arafat would have been poisoned by polonium, but must be integrated into the larger context of the police and legal investigations in connection to this case, and which are beyond our field of expertise" which shows several press articles using probability figures were completerly wrong in interpreting the results.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20161204184407/http://www.chuv.ch/ira/ira-arafat-faq.pdf Page 1 Frequently asked questions regarding the expertise conducted on President Yasser Arafat's personal belongings and remains] Lausanne, 15 December 2015 (corrected version of 15 February 2016)&lt;/ref&gt;

Joods Actueel publishes in July 2016 an updated document whereby it states that their previous analysis was confirmed by CHUV. According to them, the conclusions that are based only on [[Bayes' theorem|Bayes analysis]] are not valid as they are not documented with figures.&lt;ref&gt;[http://joodsactueel.be/wp-content/uploads-pjact001/2016/06/2_PDFsam_20160702-chuv-arafat-no-proof.pdf Two years after, the CHUV (Swiss scientists) admits no proof of Arafat's poisoning.]&lt;/ref&gt; It also reminds juridical errors based on such method as the case of [[Sally Clark]].

==Murder inquiry==

After Al Jazeera's presentation in July 2012 of the results of its nine-month investigation, Arafat's widow [[Suha Arafat]] declared her intention to launch a court case in France into the death of her husband.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nydailynews.com/news/world/yasser-arafat-widow-seeks-french-probe-death-poisoning-probe-article-1.1111556 ''Yasser Arafat's widow seeks French probe of his death amid poisoning probe'']. Associated Press, 10 July 2012&lt;/ref&gt; Suha Arafat told Al Jazeera that she had long suspected that her former husband was murdered, noting that both Israel and the United States regarded him as an obstacle to peace.&lt;ref name="aljazeera"/&gt;

On 31 July 2012, Suha Arafat and her daughter Zawra lodged a murder complaint in the Paris western suburb of Nanterre. On 28 August, French prosecutors opened a murder inquiry.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/france-opens-arafat-murder-enquiry-sources-.aspx?pageID=238&amp;nID=28856&amp;NewsCatID=351 France opens Arafat murder enquiry: sources]. AFP, 28 August 2012&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2015, a French prosecutor announced that Arafat's death was from natural causes, and found that the polonium 210 and lead 210 discovered in Arafat's grave were of an environmental nature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=French Experts Say No Foul Play in Arafat Death|url=http://www.naharnet.com/stories/en/171773-french-experts-say-no-foul-play-in-arafat-death|accessdate=17 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jpost.com/Arab-Israeli-Conflict/Arafat-was-not-poisoned-French-prosecutor-says-394173 Arafat was not poisoned, French prosecutor says]&lt;/ref&gt;

Later, a French investigation by three judges unanimously concluded that "it has not been demonstrated that Mr Yasser Arafat was murdered by polonium-210 poisoning" and that the investigation should be dropped.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.almanar.com.lb/english/adetails.php?fromval=1&amp;cid=22&amp;frid=22&amp;eid=229052|agency=AFP|issue=02-09-2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the end of June 2016, a French Court of Appeal confirmed the previous conclusions.&lt;ref&gt;http://staging.hosted.ap.org/dynamic/stories/E/EU_FRANCE_ARAFAT_DEATH?SITE=AP&amp;SECTION=HOME&amp;TEMPLATE=DEFAULT&amp;CTIME=2016-06-24-03-56-31{{full citation needed|date=February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Allegation of killing of Arafat by Israel==
Israeli officials denied in 2012 any connection with the recent finds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/world/2012-07/05/c_131697980.htm|title=Israeli officials deny Arafat poisoning rumors|date=5 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Israeli journalist [[Yossi Melman]], who specializes in espionage stories, reported that, based on his research with [[Dan Raviv]],&lt;ref&gt;released in their book ''Spies Against Armageddon: Inside Israel's Secret Wars'', {{ISBN|0985437812}}{{page needed|date=February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Israel did not kill Arafat. Melman stated that the [[Israel Defense Forces|IDF]] had wanted to take harsh action against Arafat, ranging from killing him to expelling him, but Prime Minister [[Ariel Sharon|Sharon]] rejected these ideas, stating that the advantages wouldn't outweigh being accused of killing Arafat, and Arafat already seemed to be an irrelevant leader who wasn't trusted by the international community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2012/07/10/israel-didn-t-kill-arafat.html|title=Israel Didn't Kill Arafat|work=The Daily Beast|date=10 July 2012|author=Yossi Melman}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He said "Israel as a state, is a country that has access to Polonium, had the capability to assassinate the late leader, and expressed clear interest in getting rid of him".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.imemc.org/article/66394 "Al-Qodwa: 'Arafat Died By Poison, Israel Responsible'"].

On 11 September 2003, the Israeli security Cabinet decided to "remove" Arafat. In a statement it said "Recent days' events have proven again that Yasser Arafat is a complete obstacle to any process of reconciliation... Israel will act to remove this obstacle in the manner, at the time, and in the ways that will be decided on separately..."&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/3102154.stm ''Excerpts: Israeli security cabinet statement''].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2234">'''Chore charts''' are also called reward charts, behavior charts, chore calendars, chore lists or task lists. A '''chore chart''' is a listing used to track and organize the [[house work]]. The [[chart]] can be physical or [[Virtuality|virtual]] and is often a means used by parents to post [[chores]] expected of their children.

Different homes have different ways of organizing and implementing a chore system, including simple paper charts tacked on the refrigerator. There has been a lot of research, experiential evidence and discussion of chore charts.&lt;ref name="The Telegraph"&gt;[http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=NTGB&amp;p_theme=ntgb&amp;p_action=search&amp;p_maxdocs=200&amp;p_topdoc=1&amp;p_text_direct-0=10B98D25041EDAF8&amp;p_field_direct-0=document_id&amp;p_perpage=10&amp;p_sort=YMD_date:D&amp;s_trackval=GooglePM The Telegraph]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Denver Post"&gt;[http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=DP&amp;p_theme=dp&amp;p_action=search&amp;p_maxdocs=200&amp;p_topdoc=1&amp;p_text_direct-0=0EAF44E58284CFC5&amp;p_field_direct-0=document_id&amp;p_perpage=10&amp;p_sort=YMD_date:D&amp;s_trackval=GooglePM Denver Post]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Age appropriate chores ==
Chore charts list household tasks, sometimes one chore chart per child and sometimes a combined list. Since children of different abilities and ages can handle various responsibilities, the chores featured on a chore chart can be divided by age.&lt;ref name="Los Angeles Times"&gt;[https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/latimes/access/58475642.html?dids=58475642:58475642&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;date=Jan+23%2C+1986&amp;author=BONNIE+McCULLOUGH&amp;pub=Los+Angeles+Times+(pre-1997+Fulltext)&amp;desc=Getting+Kids+to+Help+With+the+Housework&amp;pqatl=google Los Angeles Times]&lt;/ref&gt; Younger [[children]] may not responsibly handle complex chores, but may still be able and want to help around the house.

== Reward for chores ==
While some parents do not give [[allowance (money)|allowance]] or [[Bounty (reward)|reward]] for household chores, there is evidence that allowance and reward helps to create financially sound adults and teach [[financial]] responsibility.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.investopedia.com/articles/pf/07/kids_allowance.asp?viewed=1&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17053">A '''coroner''' in [[Washington state]] is a [[quasi-judicial]], public official principally charged with the certification of human death. It is completely identical in authority to the parallel office of '''medical examiner''', which also exists in the state. Washington uses a "mixed system" of death investigation with some counties employing coroners, and some employing medical examiners. 

As of 2017, 24 of Washington's 39 counties have a coroner or a medical examiner. In 15 rural counties there are neither coroners nor medical examiners;  duties normally performed by a coroner or medical examiner are instead discharged by the county's prosecuting attorney. 

This article uses the term "coroner" to refer to coroners, medical examiners, and county attorneys discharging the duties of coroners. 

==History==

===Background and early history===
The office of Coroner originated in England no later than 1194, though uncertain evidence indicates a possible older history.&lt;ref name="psq"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gross|first1=Charles|title=The Early History and Influence of the Office of Coroner|journal=[[Political Science Quarterly]]|date=December 1892|volume=7|issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the reign of [[Edward I]], there were four coroners in each county, elected to serve for life.&lt;ref name="psq"/&gt; Coroners were charged with recording and investigating deaths, of administering [[treasure trove]], and of substituting for the Sheriff when he was a party to a matter or incapacitated; the elected Coroner eventually evolved into a check on the power of the Crown-appointed Sheriff.&lt;ref name="psq"/&gt; The system of coronial death investigation was brought to North America by British colonists; one of the earliest coroners empowered in North America was appointed by [[William Penn]] in 1682 after a dead body was discovered on the banks of a river.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Lycoming County Coroner|url=http://www.lyco.org/Elected-Officials/Coroner/History|website=lyco.org|publisher=[[Lycoming County]]|accessdate=September 3, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Washington Territory]] was established in 1853 and, the following year, the Territorial Legislature passed "An Act Relative to Coroners" which required each of the territory's counties to organize an election for coroner and to hold a new election every two years thereafter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Rochester|first1=Junius|title=Washington Territory and Washington State, Founding of|url=http://www.historylink.org/File/5661|website=HistoryLink|publisher=[[HistoryLink]]|accessdate=September 3, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="wat"&gt;{{cite book|title=Journal of the Council of the Territory of Washington: Together with the Memorials and Joint Resolutions of the First Session of Legislative Assembly, Begun and Held at Olympia, February 27th, 1854|date=1855|publisher=Washington Territory|pages=105-106}}&lt;/ref&gt; This act also authorized the Coroner to perform the duties of the Sheriff in certain matters:&lt;ref name="wat"/&gt;

{{cquote|The Coroner shall perform the duties of sheriff in all cases where the sheriff is interested, or otherwise incapacitated from serving; and when the coroner acts as the sheriff, he shall possess the powers and perform all duties of the sheriff ...}}

===Efforts at reform===
As early as 1907, legislative attempts were made to require elected coroners be licensed physicians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Walla Walla Undertakes Differ in Views on the Coroners' Bill|url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/194795709/?terms=coroner|accessdate=August 26, 2017|work=Evening Statesman|publisher=[[newspapers.com]]|date=February 1, 1907}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1913 the legislature abolished the office of coroner in all counties, except "counties of the first class" (the largest counties in the state), devolving the duties of coroner to the office of county attorney. However, A.R. Maulsby, the coroner of Snohomish County - an office which had been abolished by the statute - refused to stand-down, declaring the act of the legislature to be unconstitutional. The state's Supreme Court eventually sided with Maulsby, noting that the state constitution, as it then read, required a system of county government "uniform throughout the state". In 1948, the constitution was substantially amended to allow differential forms of county government in certain circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=County Forms of Government|url=http://mrsc.org/Home/Explore-Topics/Governance/Forms-of-Government-and-Organization/County-Forms-of-Government.aspx|website=mrsc.org|publisher=Municipal Research and Services Center|accessdate=September 3, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1960 the Washington State Medical Association called for the complete abolition of the office of coroner, supporting its replacement with a system of state medial examiners and, in 1969, legislation was passed by the state's House of Representatives to do just that, however, the legislation failed in the state Senate.

[[File:Medical_Examiner_staff_member.jpg|thumb|A staff member of the King County Medical Examiner's office moves human remains in Seattle in 2016.]]
The [[Revised Code of Washington]], as of 2017, provides for the creation of an office of coroner in each county with a population of 40,000 or more.&lt;ref name="cdc"&gt;{{cite web|title=Washington|url=https://www.cdc.gov/phlp/publications/coroner/washington.html|website=Public Health Law Program|publisher=[[Centers for Disease Control]]|accessdate=August 26, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In counties with a population less than 40,000, no independent office of coroner is authorized and the duties which normally fall to a corner are discharged by the county's attorney instead.&lt;ref name="cdc"/&gt; In addition, counties which have a population greater than 250,000 may choose to replace the office of corner with that of medical examiner.&lt;ref name="cdc"/&gt;&lt;ref name="WACME"/&gt; Medical examiners are elected by the legislative authority of the county in which they hold office and are required to be certified as a forensic pathologist by the American Board of Pathology, while coroners are elected by the voters of the county in which they hold office and are required to have no qualifications other than the right to vote.&lt;ref name="cdc"/&gt;&lt;ref name="WACME"/&gt;&lt;ref name="e"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Mattarresse|first1=Andy|title=Anybody can run for coroner, but does that mean they should?|url=http://www.dailyrecordnews.com/members/anybody-can-run-for-coroner-but-does-that-mean-they/article_f14e9ed4-e2e3-11e3-b6c3-0019bb2963f4.html|accessdate=August 26, 2017|work=[[Ellensburg Daily Record]]|date=May 24, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref name="cdc"/&gt;&lt;ref name="WACME"&gt;{{cite web|title=Coroner or Medical Examiner?|url=http://www.wacme.org/coronerormedicalexaminer.html|website=WACME|publisher=Washington Association of Coroners and Medical Examiners|accessdate=August 26, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 1968, prior to the enactment of the medical examiner statute, 17 counties had coroners while the remaining 22 counties had no coroners, the county prosecuting attorney discharging the duties of coroner, instead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Legislative Viewpoint|url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/20137137/|accessdate=August 26, 2017|work=Port Angeles Evening News|publisher=[[newspapers.com]]|date=April 19, 1968}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2017 in Washington, 18 counties have coroners, six have medical examiners, and 15 have neither coroners nor medical examiners, the county attorney performs the functions otherwise discharged by a coroner or medical examiner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Death Investigation|url=https://www.islandcountywa.gov/Coroner/Pages/Investigations.aspx|website=Island County Coroner|publisher=[[Island County]]|accessdate=August 30, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Duties and authority==
===Acting Sheriff===
As of 2017, Washington law provides that a county coroner shall "perform the duties of the sheriff in all cases where the sheriff is interested or otherwise incapacitated from serving", wording unchanged from the original statute enacted by the Territorial Legislature in 1854.
[[File:Thurston County Coroner.jpg|thumb|Entrance to the Thurston County Coroner's office in 2017]]

===Death investigations===
In general, deaths in Washington are either certified by physicians, or by licensed funeral directors using information obtained from a physician pertaining to a decedant's cause of death. Certification is made to one of a number of regional registries each administered by a designated "deputy registrar" who approves each addition to the death registry. However, state law provides that deaths arising from one of a list of prescribed mechanisms (including drowning, hanging, electrocution, radiation, sodomy, strangulation, etc.), or involving a healthy person who had not received medical attention in the 36 hours preceding his or her death, or in which the death occurred in a jail or prison, or in which the identity of the decedant is unknown, or in which the death occurred under suspicious circumstances, can only be certified by a county coroner. Physicians, deputy registrars, or any person discovering a body (such as a police officer) are legally obligated to refer these cases directly to coroners who are authorized to take possession of the body, to order a forensic autopsy on it, to pronounce the cause and mechanism of death, and to determine if the death was the result of unlawful homicide, which is necessary to bring criminal charges against a person. 

In 2015, approximately 8.2 percent of all decedants in Washington were autopsied. 

====Inquests====
The coroner is, additionally, empowered to convene an inquest to advise him on the cause of death prior to certifying the death. Inquests are conducted by a jury of at least four citizens convened by the coroner, hear evidence presented by him, and make an advisory verdict. The proceedings of an inquest are open to the public (investigations held outside an inquest are otherwise confidential and information produced by it - including autopsy reports - can only be released to certain individuals, such as law enforcement officers and next of kin).

The procedure is rarely used, but has been invoked on occasions where a death is controversial and the coroner feels public scrutiny would be warranted. In 2016, following the shooting death of an Hispanic man by police in [[Franklin County, Washington]], the coroner convened an inquest of six jurors - appointing three Hispanic persons to the jury - to ensure that "the public can’t say, ‘it’s the cops investigating the cops'".&lt;ref name="nyt"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Oppel|first1=Richard|title=County Coroner in Washington Plans Inquest Amid Furor Over Police Killing|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/14/us/county-coroner-in-washington-plans-inquest-amid-furor-over-police-killing.html?mcubz=1|accessdate=August 26, 2017|work=[[New York Times]]|date=February 13, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The inquest was only the third convened in Franklin County in the preceding twenty years and ultimately ruled the death was [[Justifiable_homicide#Examples_in_the_United_States|justifiable homicide]] by gunshot.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Inquest Jury: Shooting Justified|url=http://kpq.com/inquest-jury-shooting-justified/|accessdate=August 26, 2017|work=[[KPQ (AM)]]|date=December 15, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nyt"/&gt;

Prior to 2016, coroners had the authority to issue arrest warrants should an inquest determine a cause of death as unlawful homicide.&lt;ref name="herald"/&gt; Since that time, a change in state law has required coroners to refer findings of homicide to a county prosecuting attorney for charging.&lt;ref name="herald"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Cary|first1=Anette|title=Change in coroner inquest law affects Zambrano-Montes case|url=http://www.tri-cityherald.com/news/local/crime/pasco-police-shooting/article80217522.html|accessdate=August 26, 2017|work=[[Tri-City Herald]]|date=May 26, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Unclaimed remains===
Coroners are responsible for arranging for the disposal of human remains in cases in which "there is no other person willing to provide for the disposition of the body".

==Related agencies, organizations, and programs==

===Death Investigations Account===
The costs of retaining a forensic pathologist to conduct autopsies ordered by county coroners or medical examiners are reimbursed to counties by the state from the Death Investigations Account, which is held by the [[Washington State Treasurer]].

Darkforest is of similar strength to programs like [[Crazy Stone (software)|CrazyStone]] and Zen.&lt;ref&gt;http://livestream.com/oxuni/StracheyLectureDrDemisHassabis&lt;/ref&gt; It has been tested against a professional human player at the 2016 [[Computer Go UEC Cup|UEC cup]]. [[Google]]'s [[AlphaGo]] program won against a professional player in October 2015 using a similar combination of techniques.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/jan/28/go-playing-facebook-spoil-googles-ai-deepmind|title=No Go: Facebook fails to spoil Google's big AI day|last=90210|first=HAL|date=2016-01-28|newspaper=The Guardian|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077|access-date=2016-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Darkforest is named after [[Liu Cixin]]'s science fiction novel ''[[The Dark Forest]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://xw.qq.com/tech/20160301024236/TEC201603010242360D|title=FB围棋项目负责人谈人机大战|date=2016-03-01|publisher=Tencent|language=Chinese|trans-title=FB Go Project Manager Discusses Man vs Machine Showdown}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==
Competing with top human players in the ancient game of Go has been a long-term goal of artificial intelligence. Go’s high [[branching factor]] makes traditional search techniques ineffective, even on cutting-edge hardware, and Go’s [[evaluation function]] could change drastically with one stone change. However, by using a Deep [[Convolutional neural network|Convolutional Neural Network]] designed for long-term predictions, '''Darkforest''' has been able to substantially improve the win rate for bots over more traditional [[Monte Carlo tree search|Monte Carlo Tree Search]] based approaches.

=== Matches ===
Against human players, '''Darkfores2''' achieves a stable ''[[Go ranks and ratings|3d ranking]]'' on [[KGS Go Server]], which roughly corresponds to an advanced amateur human player. However, after adding [[Monte Carlo tree search|Monte Carlo Tree Search]] to '''Darkfores2''' to create a much stronger player named '''darkfmcts3,''' it can achieve a ''5d ranking'' on the KGS Go Server.

==== Against other AI ====
'''darkfmcts3''' is on par with state-of-the-art Go AIs such as Zen, DolBaram and [[Crazy Stone (software)|Crazy Stone]] but lags behind AlphaGo.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Mastering the game of Go with deep neural networks and tree search|url = https://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v529/n7587/full/nature16961.html|journal = [[Nature (journal)|Nature]]| issn= 0028-0836|pages = 484–489|volume = 529|issue = 7587|doi = 10.1038/nature16961|pmid = 26819042|first1 = David|last1 = Silver|author-link1=David Silver (programmer)|first2 = Aja|last2 = Huang|author-link2=Aja Huang|first3 = Chris J.|last3 = Maddison|first4 = Arthur|last4 = Guez|first5 = Laurent|last5 = Sifre|first6 = George van den|last6 = Driessche|first7 = Julian|last7 = Schrittwieser|first8 = Ioannis|last8 = Antonoglou|first9 = Veda|last9 = Panneershelvam|first10= Marc|last10= Lanctot|first11= Sander|last11= Dieleman|first12=Dominik|last12= Grewe|first13= John|last13= Nham|first14= Nal|last14= Kalchbrenner|first15= Ilya|last15= Sutskever|author-link15=Ilya Sutskever|first16= Timothy|last16= Lillicrap|first17= Madeleine|last17= Leach|first18= Koray|last18= Kavukcuoglu|first19= Thore|last19= Graepel|first20= Demis |last20=Hassabis|author-link20=Demis Hassabis|date= 28 January 2016|bibcode = 2016Natur.529..484S|accessdate=10 December 2017}}{{closed access}}&lt;/ref&gt; It won 3rd place in [https://www.gokgs.com/tournEntrants.jsp?sort=s&amp;id=1005 January 2016 KGS Bot Tournament] against other Go AIs.

=== News Coverage ===
After [[Google]]'s [[AlphaGo]] won against [[Fan Hui]] in 2015, [[Facebook]] made its AI's hardware designs public, alongside releasing the code behind DarkForest as open-source, along with heavy recruiting to strengthen its team of AI engineers.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Style of play ==
'''Darkforest''' uses a neural network to sort through the 10&lt;sup&gt;100&lt;/sup&gt; board positions, and find the most powerful next move.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.technologyreview.com/s/544181/how-facebooks-ai-researchers-built-a-game-changing-go-engine/|title=How Facebook’s AI Researchers Built a Game-Changing Go Engine|website=MIT Technology Review|access-date=2016-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, neural networks alone cannot match the level of good amateur players or the best search-based Go engines, and so '''Darkfores2''' combines the neural network approach with a search-based machine. A database of 250,000 real Go games were used in the development of '''Darkforest''', with 220,000 used as a training set and the rest used to test the neural network's ability to predict the next moves played in the real games.  This allows Darkforest to accurately evaluate the global state of the board, but local tactics were still poor. Search-based engines have poor global evaluation, but are good at local tactics. Combining these two approaches is difficult because search-based engines work much faster than neural networks, a problem which was solved in '''Darkfores2''' by running the processes in parallel with frequent communication between the two.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Conventional strategies ===
Go is generally played by analyzing the position of the stones on the board. Some advanced players have described it as playing in some part subconsciously. Unlike chess and checkers, where AI players can simply look farther forward at moves than human players, but with each round of Go having on average 250 possible moves, that approach is ineffective. Instead, neural networks copy human play by training the AI systems on images of successful moves, the AI can effectively learn how to interpret how the board looks, as many grandmasters do.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.wired.com/2015/12/google-and-facebook-race-to-solve-the-ancient-game-of-go/|title=Google and Facebook Race to Solve the Ancient Game of Go With AI|website=WIRED|language=en-US|access-date=2016-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2015, Facebook demonstrated the combination of MCTS with neural networks, which played with a style that "felt human".&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

=== Flaws ===
It has been noted that Darkforest still has flaws in its play style. Sometimes the bot plays [[tenuki]] ("move elsewhere") pointlessly when local powerful moves are required. When the bot is losing, it shows the typical behavior of MCTS, it plays bad moves and loses more. The Facebook AI team has acknowledged these as areas of future improvement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-35419141|title=Facebook trains AI to beat humans at Go board game - BBC News|website=BBC News|language=en-GB|access-date=2016-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Program architecture ==
The family of '''Darkforest''' computer go programs is based on [[Convolutional neural network|convolution neural networks]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The most recent advances in '''Darkfmcts3''' combined convolutional neural networks with more traditional [[Monte Carlo tree search]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Darkfmcts3 is the most advanced version of Darkforest, which combines Facebook's most advanced convolutional neural network architecture from Darkfores2 with a [[Monte Carlo tree search]].

'''Darkfmcts3''' relies on a [[Convolutional neural network|convolution neural networks]] that predicts the next k moves based on the current state of play. It treats the board as a 19x19 image with multiple channels. Each channel represents a different aspect of board information based upon the specific style of play. For standard and extended play, there are 21 and 25 different channels, respectively. In standard play, each players [[List of Go terms#Liberty|liberties]] are represented as six binary channels or planes. The respective plane is true if the player one, two, or three or more liberties available. [[List of Go terms#Ko|Ko]] (i.e. illegal moves) is represented as one binary plane. Stone placement for each opponent and empty board positions are represented as three binary planes, and the duration since a stone has been placed is represented as real numbers on two planes, one for each player. Lastly, the opponents rank is represented by nine binary planes, where if all are true, the player is a 9d level, if 8 are true, a 8d level, and so forth. Extended play additionally considers the boarder (binary plane that is true at the border), position mask (represented as distance from the board center, i.e. &lt;math&gt; x^{(-0.5 * distance^2)}&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is a real number at a position), and each player's territory (binary, based on which player a location is closer to).

Darkfmct3 uses a 12-layer full convolutional network with a width of 384 nodes without weight sharing or pooling. Each convolutional layer is followed by a [[Rectifier (neural networks)|rectified linear unit]], a popular activation function for deep neural networks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last2=Bengio|first2=Yoshua|last3=Hinton|first3=Geoffrey|date=27 May 2015|title=Deep learning|journal=Nature|volume=521|issue=7553|pages=436–444|doi=10.1038/nature14539|last1=LeCun|first1=Yann|pmid=26017442|bibcode=2015Natur.521..436L}}&lt;/ref&gt; A key innovation of Darkfmct3 compared to previous approaches is that it uses only one [[softmax function]] to predict the next move, which enables the approach to reduce the overall number of parameters.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Darkfmct3 was trained against 300 random selected games from an empirical dataset representing different game stages. The learning rate was determined by vanilla [[stochastic gradient descent]].

Darkfmct3 [[Synchronization (computer science)|synchronously]] couples a convolutional neural network with a [[Monte Carlo tree search]]. Because the convolutional neural network is computationally taxing, the Monte Carlo tree search focuses computation on the more likely game play trajectories. By running the neural network synchronously with the Monte Carlo tree search, it is possible to guarantee that each node is expanded by the moves predicted by the neural network.

== Comparison with other systems ==
'''Darkfores2''' beats '''Darkforest''', its neural network-only predecessor, around 90% of the time, and Pachi, one of the best search-based engines, around 95% of the time.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; On the [[Go ranks and ratings|Kyu rating system]], Darkforest holds a 1-2d level. '''Darkfores2''' achieves a stable 3d level on KGS Go Server as a ranked bot.&lt;ref name="facebook-paper2" /&gt; With the added [[Monte Carlo tree search]], '''Darkfmcts3''' with 5,000 rollouts beats Pachi with 10k rollouts in all 250 games; with 75k rollouts it achieves a stable 5d level in KGS server, on par with state-of-the-art Go AIs (e.g., Zen, DolBaram, CrazyStone); with 110k rollouts, it won the 3rd place in January KGS Go Tournament.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

He was found [[Acquittal|not guilty]] but admitted in a press interview to having helped up to 300 people to die.&lt;ref name=mssm&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mssm.edu/msjournal/69/v69_5_page317_328.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-07-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070510133752/http://www.mssm.edu/msjournal/69/v69_5_page317_328.pdf |archivedate=2007-05-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was the first doctor in Britain to be tried solely for the mercy killing of a patient.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/uk/1999/may/12/claredyer?commentpage=1 Guardian]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Moor worked as a GP in [[Stamfordham, Northumberland|Stamfordham]], [[Northumberland]], but retired just before his trial in 1999.

==George Liddell==
George Liddell was an 85-year-old ex-ambulance driver and a widower, who was suffering from [[colorectal cancer|cancer of the bowel]]. An operation was done to remove part of his bowel, but there was still some cancerous tissue left in surrounding fatty tissue and the [[liver]]. Liddell was sent home by the hospital to live with his daughter, and be treated by Moor and a team of nurses. The patient's condition deteriorated and he became depressed and appeared to be in significant pain. Moor prescribed 5&amp;nbsp;mg of [[diamorphine]] to be taken at intervals, but this had to be doubled when the pain got worse. It was agreed by his carers he was "[[terminally ill]]".&lt;ref name=mssm/&gt;

It was agreed to send Liddell to a [[hospice]]. Moor set the diamorphine level at a rate of 30&amp;nbsp;mg per 24-hours by means of a [[syringe driver]]. Liddell's breathing got worse and on 19 July 1997 Moor gave him an injection of diamorphine and [[chlorpromazine]]. Within about 20 minutes Liddell was dead.&lt;ref name=mssm/&gt;

The case would have gone unnoticed, but when ''[[The Sunday Times]]'' published an article by [[Michael Irwin]] on euthanasia, a journalist [[Rachel Ellis]] asked Moor his opinion on the subject. Moor said that he had given many patients [[overdose]]s of diamorphine, a comment he repeated in an interview on television. In particular, his statement that "This week I helped two patients on the way to a pain-free release from their painful agony and suffering" and that he had perhaps helped 10 patients per year for 30 years attracted considerable media attention. One newspaper called Moor "Britain’s greatest [[serial killer]]" and referred to him as "Doctor Death".&lt;ref name=mssm/&gt;

==Trial==
The trial, presided over by Mr Justice Hooper, took place at [[Newcastle upon Tyne|Newcastle]] [[Crown Court]] on 4 April 1999 and concluded on 11 May 1999. It was prosecuted by James Goss [[Queen's Counsel|QC]] and Moor was defended by Anthony Arlidge QC. One key turning point in the case was the exclusion of [[toxicology|toxicological]] evidence regarding the amount of diamorphine given, calling into question whether the final injection had in fact caused death.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/uk/1999/may/12/claredyer?commentpage=1 'All I tried to do was relieve his agony, his distress and suffering' | UK news | The Guardian&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

The jury took 65 minutes to find Moor not guilty.&lt;ref name=mssm/&gt; Mr Justice Hooper awarded the defence team only two-thirds of their costs, because Moor had brought the prosecution on himself by "very silly remarks to the press" and by lying to the [[National Health Service|NHS]] and the police.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

Patient and former model Fiona McAndrew ran The Friends Of Dr Moor support campaign. They marched through the streets of Newcastle carrying a banner calling for the doctor to be acquitted. Former medical director Dr Micheal Urvin also attended the march he carried the banner alongside Fiona McAndrew. More than 300 of the doctors patients and supporters turned out for the March.

==Reaction==
Dr [[Michael Wilks]], chairman of the [[British Medical Association]]'s ethics committee, said after the trial that guidelines for doctors were insufficiently clear: "We are no further along the road towards any change in the law on euthanasia [...] This case just tells us that doctors who take the law into their own hands, who intend to kill their patients, as it was originally thought that Dr Moor had, are likely to be prosecuted."&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/340981.stm BBC News | Health | Moor acquittal prompts strong reaction&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Broadcaster [[Ludovic Kennedy]] said: "Dr Moor should never have been tried - the whole trial was a complete waste of time and money [...] He was only doing what hundreds and hundreds of doctors do in this country every year. The sooner the law is changed to allow doctors to legally help people on their way, the better."&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/341525.stm BBC News | Health | Medics review 'doctor-assisted suicide'&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Death Watch''''' ({{lang-fr|La Mort en direct}}) is a 1980 [[science fiction film]] directed by [[Bertrand Tavernier]]. It is based on the novel ''[[The Unsleeping Eye]]'' by [[David G. Compton]], also known as ''The Continuous Katherine Mortenhoe.'' The film was entered into the [[30th Berlin International Film Festival]].&lt;ref name="imdb"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0081182/awards|title=IMDB.com: Awards for Death Watch|accessdate=2010-08-20|work=imdb.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film had 1,013,842 admissions in France and was the 35th most attended film of the year.&lt;ref name="JPBox Office"&gt;http://www.jpbox-office.com/fichfilm.php?id=7460&amp;affich=france&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
The film is set in a future where death from illness has become rare. When Katherine Mortenhoe ([[Romy Schneider]]) is diagnosed as having an incurable disease, she becomes a celebrity and is besieged by journalists. The television company NTV (headed by Vincent Ferriman) offers her a large sum of money if she will allow her last days to be filmed and made into a [[reality television]] show – they have already spied on her as she is told of her diagnosis (her doctor is colluding with them) and prepared posters for the show which show her face (to her annoyance when she sees the posters on display before they have contacted her).
   
Katherine pretends to agree but evades NTV's employees and goes on the run with the assistance of a casual acquaintance called Roddy ([[Harvey Keitel]]).  The audience knows – but she does not – that Roddy is, in fact, a senior NTV cameraman who has undergone an experimental surgical procedure which implants cameras and transmitters behind his eyes, so that everything he sees is relayed back to NTV, who use it as the basis for their reality show. Roddy has done this mainly for money to give his estranged wife and their son. A side-effect of the procedure is that he will go blind if he experiences more than a short period of darkness; he uses drugs to keep awake, has learned to sleep for brief periods with his eyes open, and carries a [[flashlight]] which he shines on his eyes at night.  Meanwhile, Katherine's doctor has discovered that she is not actually dying and he informs NTV who tell no one and continue with the show, broadcasting an edited version of Roddy's feed.

Continuing on the lam, Katherine asks Roddy to take her to Land's End. The two arrive and sit on the beach and have a long talk. Katherine then asks Roddy to take her to town and buy her some lipstick. He persuades her to stay by the beach knowing that she will be recognized if she goes with him. In town, Roddy sees "Death Watch" playing in a pub and begins to cry. He returns to the beach as night is falling and has an emotional breakdown, losing his flashlight. Katherine comes to him and he asks her to help him. She finds the flashlight and shines it in his eyes, but he has already gone blind. Roddy admits who he is, and what he is doing, to her. 

As the feed has ended to NTV due to Roddy's blindness, they send a helicopter to Land's End with a film crew to finally reveal to Katherine that she is not dying. However, Roddy and Katherine leave undetected as the helicopter arrives. Katherine takes Roddy to her husband's (Von Sydow) home in the country nearby. She has not seen her husband Gerald in 6 years. After the two stay overnight, Katherine and Gerald talk about their relationship as Roddy sleeps in a chair outside. NTV calls Gerald's home and after he speaks with them, he tells Katherine they are coming and that she is not dying and needs to stop taking the medicine she was given. Instead, Katherine takes all of it. Gerald is angry at first but finally accepts her decision. Roddy awakens and Gerald informs him that Katherine has died. NTV arrives by helicopter with producer Vincent and Roddy's wife in tow. Roddy and Gerald threaten to kill Vincent and he and the rest of the NTV crew leave with Roddy's wife staying behind. Roddy reconciles with his wife and introduces her to Gerald.

==Filming==
Much of the filming took place in and around [[Glasgow]], including: [[Glasgow Necropolis]], [[Glasgow Cathedral]], the former Queen's Dock on the [[River Clyde]] and the [[Glasgow City Chambers]].  The film is dedicated to deceased film director Jacques Turner.

'''Doomsday''' is a fictional [[supervillain]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[DC Comics]], commonly as an adversary of [[Superman]], as well as the [[Justice League]]. Created by writer-artist [[Dan Jurgens]], the character had a cameo appearance in ''[[Superman: The Man of Steel]]'' #17 (November 1992) and made his first full appearance in ''Superman: The Man of Steel'' #18 (December 1992).

Doomsday ranked as #46 on IGN's list of the Top 100 Comic Book Villains of All Time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://comics.ign.com/top-100-villains/46.html | title=Doomsday is number 46 | work=[[IGN]] | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6B59UfRH1?url=http://comics.ign.com/top-100-villains/46.html | archivedate=2012-10-01 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; He is best known as the only character who supposedly killed Superman in combat in ''[[The Death of Superman]]'' story arc. The character appears in the 2016 film ''[[Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice]]'', voiced and performed by [[Robin Atkin Downes]] through motion-capture.

==Publication history==
[[File:Doomsday (concept design).jpg|thumb|right|Concept art for Doomsday by [[Dan Jurgens]].]]
Doomsday was conceived in 1991 during an annual brainstorming session with the editors and writers of Superman comics, in response to a concern by some writers that most of Superman's foes at this point either relied on technology or their intellect to outmaneuver Superman or had some natural advantage against him, wanting to create a new foe with great physical power to match him. Several writers proposed having Superman die at the hands of a "bestial foe", and editor [[Mike Carlin]] scribbled this idea on the wall chart as "doomsday for Superman". Inspired, they chose "Doomsday" as the name for this villain.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Tye|2012}}: "Next [Mike Carlin] scribbled on his story board "doomsday for Superman." Others chimed in, trying to imagine a villain omnipotent enough to do in Superman and how a world without him would look. By the time they left the room they had a rough outline for a series of stories. Superman would duke it out with an all-new evil predator who was tearing apart Metropolis. What to call him or it? The answer was there on Carlin’s chart: Doomsday."&lt;/ref&gt;

Doomsday had a cameo appearance in ''[[Superman: The Man of Steel]]'' #17 (Nov. 1992) and made his first full appearance in ''[[Superman: The Man of Steel]]'' #18 (Dec. 1992).

==Fictional character biography==
Doomsday is depicted as a deadly monster genetically-engineered from the depths of prehistoric [[Krypton (comics)|Krypton]].  His creator imbued him with few feelings, mostly hate and destruction, which led to him destroying worlds and eventually finding Earth where he meets Superman. The character is best known as [[Superman]]'s murderer in the 1992 [[plot (narrative)|storyline]], "[[The Death of Superman]]".

===''The Ultimate Killing Machine''===
Originally known as "The Ultimate", Doomsday was born in prehistoric times on [[Krypton (comics)|Krypton]], long before the humanoid Kryptonian race gained dominance over the planet about 250,000 years ago. It was a violent, hellish world where only the absolute strongest of creatures could survive.&lt;ref name="hunter"&gt;{{Cite comic

The baby's remains were collected and used to [[cloning|clone]] a stronger version. This process was repeated over and over for decades as a form of accelerated natural evolution. The agony of these repeated deaths was [[Lamarckism|recorded in his genes]], driving the creature to hate all life.

As it evolved, the child eventually became able to survive the high temperatures and searing atmosphere, only to be quickly slain by the vicious predators that inhabited the planet. Over time, and without the assistance of Bertron's technology, he gained the ability to thrive on [[solar energy]] without the need for food or air, to return to life and adapt in order to overcome whatever had previously killed him. The Ultimate hunted and exterminated the dangerous predators of Krypton. He then killed Bertron himself, whom he had come to identify as an enemy.&lt;ref name="hunter" /&gt;

The Ultimate escaped Krypton via a ship that regularly arrived to deliver supplies to Bertron (who had wanted little contact with the planet's natives) and went on a killing spree across several planets. It began 245,000 years earlier on planet Bylan 5, where Apokoliptian prince Uxas (the future [[Darkseid]]) was about to wed a princess (in order to obtain that planet's chemical deposits for [[Apokolips]]'s weapons factories). The Ultimate killed Uxas' ally Master Mayhem almost instantly and instilled great fear on Uxas after watching their fight. Just as the Ultimate and Uxas were about to meet in combat, Uxas was forced to flee; Ultimate's rampage had caused the planet's atmosphere to become toxic, thereby rendering the chemicals worthless to Apokolips. The Ultimate hitched a ride on an escaping shuttle, which crashed on [[Khund]]ia. The warring Khundian clans united in order to build protective armor for a warrior named Kobald, who they hoped would survive long enough to force the Ultimate onto a rocket. Once the rocket was in space, the Ultimate killed Kobald and the resulting explosion sent him hurling through space.

He next crossed paths with a [[Green Lantern]] named Zharan Pel who was beaten to death. The Ultimate took the Lantern's [[Power ring (DC Comics)|power ring]] and, sensing the power of the [[Guardians of the Universe]], headed towards them. The thousands of Green Lanterns that were sent to stop him were slaughtered. He continued to [[Oa]], where a single Guardian fought him, wary of the others joining the fight, fearing the Ultimate would absorb their powers as he believed was happening to his powers, so as a last resort sacrificed himself in battle to defeat him. The release of energies by the Guardian caused a tear in space through which the Ultimate fell.

Eventually arriving on the planet Calaton, he ravaged that world for three years.&lt;ref name="hunter" /&gt; With only the capital city left, the royal family combined their life forces into a single energy being, the Radiant.&lt;ref name="hunter" /&gt;&lt;ref name="dc-ency"&gt;{{Cite book | last = Greenberger | first = Robert | author-link = Robert Greenberger | contribution = Doomsday | editor-last = Dougall | editor-first = Alastair | title = The DC Comics Encyclopedia | page = 108 | publisher = [[Dorling Kindersley]] | place = New York | year = 2008 | isbn = 0-7566-4119-5 | oclc = 213309017 | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Radiant killed the Ultimate with a huge blast of energy (laying waste to over a fifth of his planet in the process). In common Calatonian burial procedures, the Ultimate's seemingly dead body was suited and shackled to prevent his spirit from escaping into the afterlife, and he was shot into space because the murders he committed made him unworthy of burial on Calaton. Eventually, his metallic casket crashed on Earth, the force of the impact driving it deep underground.&lt;ref name="hunter" /&gt;

===''The Death of Superman''===
{{Main article|The Death of Superman}}
[[File:Superman The Man of Steel 18 (December 1992).jpg|thumb|upright|Doomsday's first full appearance, on the cover of ''Superman: The Man of Steel'' vol. 1 #18 (December 1992). Art by [[Jon Bogdanove]] and [[Dennis Janke]].]]
After freeing one arm and smashing his way out of his buried vault, The Ultimate went on a rampage in Midwestern America, where he first encountered the [[Justice League]]. He defeated the entire team of [[superhero]]es in a matter of minutes, which in turn attracted the attention of Superman.&lt;ref name="dc-ency" /&gt; Most notable is the fact that the creature fought the whole time literally with one hand tied behind his back (due to his ancient burial cables), yet was still able to lay waste to all opposition and much of the surrounding area. The only Justice Leaguer who could defend herself against the creature was [[Maxima (comics)|Maxima]]. The creature gained its new name when League member [[Booster Gold]] remarked how the rampage resembled "the arrival of [[Doomsday event|Doomsday]]". The comment reached the broadcast media and led to the creature becoming known by its new name of Doomsday. Five Leaguers, including Superman, combined their energy powers in an attempt to take Doomsday down, but succeeded only in destroying the last of his ancient burial cables, allowing him to use both hands.

During his rampage, Doomsday's interest was captured by billboards and television spots advertising violent wrestling competitions held in [[Metropolis (comics)|Metropolis]], which appealed to his blood lust and thus enticed the otherwise mindless creature to head towards the city. In counterattacking the creature, Superman quickly found that his opponent's power was a match for his own and was getting stronger, and he realized that if Doomsday actually reached Metropolis, the resulting battle could conceivably destroy the city and kill millions of innocent people. Doomsday developed a strong desire to murder Superman, a desire that was later explained in the ''Hunter/Prey'' miniseries: from the agony of continually dying during his creation process, Doomsday developed in his genes the ability to sense anyone Kryptonian, as well as an overriding instinct to treat any such being as an automatic threat.

In the space of a few issues of the Superman comic book series, Doomsday battled Superman in a titanic struggle, leading the hero to conclude that the creature would continue to attack relentlessly and endlessly, with no fear or compassion. Matters came to a head in ''Superman'' (vol. 2) #75, wherein both Doomsday and Superman beat each other to death in front of the Daily Planet building in Metropolis.&lt;ref name="dc-ency" /&gt;

Following the battle, four super-beings appeared and took up Superman's mantle, two of them declaring themselves to be the real Superman. One was a [[Hank Henshaw|half-man/half-machine]] who greatly resembled Superman with [[Cybernetics|cybernetic]] implants where Superman had sustained the greatest amount of damage from Doomsday's blows. This "Superman" took custody of Doomsday's body. After strapping the body to an [[asteroid]] with an electronic device attached, the cyborg flung Doomsday into deep space on a trajectory supposedly certain to never intersect any other planet. The issue ended with a frame of a reawakened and laughing Doomsday, still chained to the asteroid but otherwise alive.

===Rematch: ''Hunter/Prey''===
Eventually, after passing through a [[wormhole]], Doomsday's asteroid was accidentally found by a deep-space scavenger ship. Upon closer examination of the peculiar-looking drifting rock, the ship's crew retrieved the object, hoping to find something of value. The scavenger vessel happened to be on a route to Apokolips, the home of the now-powerful tyrant Darkseid, empowered by the fabled Omega Force long after his first encounter with Doomsday. Doomsday was fully rested and, after slaughtering the crew of the salvage ship, found himself landing on the harsh world. This was to be the setup for a final showdown between Doomsday and Superman, who had been uneasy about the possibility of Doomsday's resurrection. With the help of his [[Justice League]] contacts, Superman procured a [[Mother Box]], a sentient computer, after Darkseid's servant [[Desaad]] contacted Earth about a problem on Apokolips.

Unknown to Superman, Doomsday had faced and beaten Darkseid in single combat, even after withstanding the full effect of Darkseid's Omega Beams, and was laying waste to Apokolips. Unfortunately, before Superman could deal with Doomsday, Desaad opened a [[boom tube]] to Calaton—the first world where Doomsday was successfully defeated—and sent Doomsday through, to what he believed was his defeat at the hands of the Radiant. Doomsday was able to adapt, however, and overcome any opponent because of the process by which he was created, so, although the Radiant had defeated him once, he would not be able to defeat him again. Likewise, even though Superman had killed Doomsday once before, he was unable to do so again. Superman, while knowing this — having been filled in on Doomsday's history by the time-manipulating [[Waverider (comics)|Waverider]] — was obsessed with stopping Doomsday and followed him to Calaton. He fought Doomsday again with the help of the Mother Box, but, despite it providing him with extra weapons such as an ultrasonic gun and an [[energy sword]], Superman met with defeat as Doomsday's evolutions rendered him immune to Superman's attacks, such as his auditory channels being sealed by new bone growths or his knuckle-bones being able to shoot out of his body to 'pin' Superman in the air. Eventually, with his left arm having suffered a compound fracture and most of his weapons lost, Superman was forced to use one of Waverider's time travel devices to leave Doomsday stranded at the End of Time, where Doomsday met the one force he could not overcome: [[Heat death of the universe|entropy]]. Upon returning Superman to the present, the Mother Box healed Superman's injuries and then "died." On Apokolips, Darkseid became fascinated with Doomsday's abilities after learning his origin from Waverider.

===''The Doomsday Wars''===
Doomsday returned yet again in the miniseries ''The Doomsday Wars''. In this series, Prin Vnok, an underling of [[Brainiac (character)|Brainiac]], uses his technology to travel to the End of Time to retrieve Doomsday in order to combine the beast's massive power with Brainiac's formidable intellect after his original body was badly injured in his last fight with Superman (this was explained as having taken place at the time of the timeline's reconstruction following the events of "[[Zero Hour (comics)|Zero Hour]]"; the reconstruction of time meant that Brainiac was able to change the events of Doomsday's defeat). He was unable to erase Doomsday's consciousness with drugs, however, because he reacted too fast for the process to work. With Doomsday's strength of will too strong for Brainiac to permanently overwhelm him on his own, Brainiac instead opted to use a human host to genetically engineer a Doomsday clone without the mind of the original, while temporarily lodging in Doomsday's head to use the creature's strength until he would be forced out. He chose to use [[Pete Ross]] and [[Lana Lang]]'s newborn baby, born eight weeks premature and transported by Superman to a hospital. Brainiac intercepted Superman and stole the baby to hurt his long-time foe, correctly deducing that it was the child of someone close to Superman and feeling that the baby's still-malleable DNA would make him ideal for the plan. In the end, Superman thwarted Brainiac's plot by driving him out of Doomsday's body via the use of a telepathy-blocking "psi-blocker", simultaneously rescuing the baby from Brainiac's equipment after his foe's treatments brought the child to full-term before infusing him with Doomsday's DNA. He then lured Doomsday to the moon, where he placed him in a kind of [[Stasis (fiction)|stasis]] with four Justice League [[Teleportation|teleporters]]. Perpetually transporting between those four booths, Doomsday would never be more than 25% integrated, and was thus unable to escape.

===''Our Worlds at War''===
Following these events, Doomsday was released by [[Manchester Black]]'s [[Suicide Squad#Adventures of Superman|Suicide Squad]] to battle [[Imperiex]], a threat that was judged to be even greater than Doomsday himself.&lt;ref name="dc-ency" /&gt; Once freed, Doomsday slaughtered the Squad, then went on to battle Imperiex's numerous probes (his mind having been altered by Black to regard them as the threat he normally perceived Superman to be), which had thus far managed to seriously injure or kill most of Earth's heroes. Doomsday tore through numerous probes with seemingly little effort, while aided by Superman—the only time the two enemies would come close to teaming up—before finally confronting Imperiex himself. Imperiex proved too much for Doomsday—he blasted the creature, reducing him to a glowing skeleton.

===Sentience===
''Superman'' (vol. 2) #175 commemorated the 100th issue since the death of Superman in battle with Doomsday, by staging a rematch. Doomsday's skeleton was retrieved and his flesh regrown by [[Lex Luthor]] (using Superman's Kryptonian DNA), who handed Doomsday over to Darkseid to repay Earth's war debt to Apokolips. By this time, Doomsday had evolved intelligence and [[sentience]]. Luthor arranged for the [[Joker (character)|Joker]] to set Doomsday loose in Washington, D.C., to demonstrate that he was "in good working condition". It also happened to be the anniversary of the day that Superman had died while stopping Doomsday. Despite being weakened by [[kryptonite]] exposure when Luthor attempted to exploit Doomsday's Kryptonian origins, Superman's heart was restarted by [[Black Lightning]] and he reached Doomsday just as the monster was struggling with the [[Martian Manhunter]] (J'onn J'onzz). Learning from J'onzz that Doomsday wanted to kill Luthor because he blamed Luthor for his "death" in the Imperiex War, Superman would soon fight Doomsday again and, this time, humbly defeat the creature by knocking him out and proving to himself and the world that Doomsday would never be Superman's equal anymore:

&lt;blockquote&gt;You're different now. You can think for yourself. So think about this. Before, you were a mindless thing. Nothing could hurt you. You couldn't feel pain, much less understand it. But once you have felt it—it changes you—forever. And you'll begin to understand something new. Fear. I've lived with it all my life. You don't want to die again, do you? The agony of what's happened to you affects your speed—your strength...and that little bit of doubt—that you cannot win today—grows. You understand now, don't you? You will never hurt me again. You will never kill me again. Never again!&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Darkseid attempted to replicate Doomsday, producing an army of Doomsday "clones". Darkseid was not able to duplicate perfectly the creature in all its raw power, and they were defeated by a combination of heat vision and [[Batman]]'s explosive [[batarang]]s during an attack on [[Themyscira (DC Comics)|Paradise Island]], while Darkseid kidnapped the newly arrived [[Supergirl|Kara Zor-El/Supergirl]].&lt;ref&gt;''Superman/Batman'' #10 (2004)&lt;/ref&gt;

When Superman traveled to Apokolips to reclaim the life of [[Steel (John Henry Irons)|Steel]], [[Mortalla]] (Darkseid's wife) ordered his troops to release Doomsday in an attempt to help Darkseid. Doomsday's short freedom was quickly halted by Steel in the Entropy Aegis, an armor with incredible power that had been built out of the remains of an Imperiex probe.&lt;ref&gt;''Superman VS Darkseid: Apokolips Now!'' (2003)&lt;/ref&gt; Doomsday disappeared and was seen wandering the harsh lands of Apokolips.

With his newfound intelligence, Doomsday managed to escape Apokolips and return to Earth. Upon his arrival, Doomsday encountered a series of emotions previously alien to him—love, compassion, and kindness. Exploring the full range of these new emotions, Doomsday made his way to Metropolis once more, though not in the destructive manner he had before. Upon his arrival in Metropolis, Doomsday found Superman at the brink of death at the hands of [[Gog (DC Comics)|Gog]] and intervened to help Superman in an ultimately futile fight against Gog's army.

In a new future, Doomsday was remembered as one of Earth's greatest heroes, who continued Superman's legacy by leading an army under his name against the army of Gog. This new timeline ended when it was revealed that Superman was still alive, trapped and tortured with kryptonite for two centuries by Gog. Ultimately, Superman managed to convince Gog of the error of his ways. Gog offered to correct the past by returning Doomsday to an earlier point in the timeline but, in the process, Doomsday would lose his intelligence and humanity. Returned to the present, an unconscious Doomsday was transported away by a younger version of Gog to an unknown location for an unknown purpose.

===Infinite Crisis===
During ''[[Infinite Crisis]]'', Doomsday was freed from captivity in a cavern near the center of the Earth by [[Doctor Psycho]] and [[Warp (comics)|Warp]]. Doctor Psycho mind-controlled him and used him as the "spear-carrier" of a super villain assault on Metropolis.&lt;ref&gt;''Villains United Infinite Crisis Special'' (June 2006)&lt;/ref&gt; As he came into full view in front of [[Green Arrow]], he was stopped by [[Superman|Kal-El]] and [[Superman (Earth-Two)|Kal-L]], who made quick work of the villain as, for the first time since the first Crisis, the two Supermen acted as a team.&lt;ref&gt;''Infinite Crisis'' #6 (May 2006)&lt;/ref&gt;

===New Krypton===
{{Main article|Superman: New Krypton}}
Doomsday returned in the final page of ''Superman'' (vol. 1) #681, crashing in Metropolis shortly after the representatives of [[Kandor (comics)|Kandor]] met with the President. Doomsday was then apparently killed on [[Earth]]'s [[moon]] when Superman, Supergirl, and many of Kandor's inhabitants jumped him to death in ''Action Comics'' #871, crushing the monster's skull.

After the fight, Doomsday's mangled corpse ended up in the hands of General [[Sam Lane (comics)|Sam Lane]], who was in charge of a mysterious government agency determined to halt the Kryptonian "invasion" of Earth. It has been hinted at that General Lane sent Doomsday after the Kandorians in the first place, and the creature is only one of the "weapons" at Lane's disposal. General Lane put Lex Luthor to work on apparently "improving" Doomsday who, by the end of ''New Krypton'', had still not awoken from his most recent death.

During the fight, Zor-El (Superman's uncle) told him that Doomsday was created by Kryptonians on ancient Krypton through "forced evolution" and, as a result, the creature hates all Kryptonians.

===Reign of Doomsday===
{{Main article|Reign of Doomsday}}
Doomsday returned to carve a new path of destruction throughout the DC Universe. His journey started in the [[Steel (John Henry Irons)|Steel]] one-shot and continued into ''[[Outsiders (comics)|Outsiders]]'' #37, ''[[Justice League of America]]'' #55, ''[[Superman/Batman]]'' Annual #5, ''[[Superboy (Kon-El)|Superboy]]'' #6 and into the milestone ''[[Action Comics]]'' #900.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://dcu.blog.dccomics.com/2011/01/04/dcu-in-2011-what-does-doomsday-want DCU in 2011: What does Doomsday want?]''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://dcu.blog.dccomics.com/2011/01/20/six-things-you-need-to-know-about-action-comics-issue-900 Six Things You Need to Know about ACTION COMICS Issue 900]&lt;/ref&gt;
Doomsday, exhibiting an increased, broadened power set which seemed to adapt to each of his opponents, attacked, defeated and abducted Steel, the Cyborg Superman, the [[Eradicator (comics)|Eradicator]], Supergirl and Superboy, before taking them to a cloaked satellite at the former location of New Krypton. Superman discovered that this was all part of a plot by Lex Luthor, which had become obsolete. After locating the satellite, Superman attempted to free his allies, only for them all to discover the apparently still-inert body of Doomsday, as well as three separate clones or copies—each with a different power set.&lt;ref&gt;''Action Comics'' #900 (April 2011)&lt;/ref&gt;

Attempting to flee from the clones with Doomsday, the Superman Family discovered that their ship is now on course for Earth with the potential to trigger an [[Extinction event|extinction-level event]] if it were to strike. Their attempt to divert the ship was interrupted by a being called "Doomslayer", who resembled a cyborg version of Doomsday and was later revealed to be a Doomsday who was tossed down an infinite tube that gave it time to evolve. Doomslayer effortlessly tore Eradicator apart and proclaimed that Earth must die for the future.&lt;ref&gt;''Action Comics'' #901 (May 2011)&lt;/ref&gt;

Doomslayer believed the original Doomsday to be an infection, so it planned to destroy Earth, as it considered Earth to be ground zero for Doomsday's "infection". Superman and his friends escaped the ship with the original Doomsday and stopped the ship from crashing on Earth, pushing it into Metropolis's bay. Afterward, Doomslayer attacked the city with the Doomsday clones, determined to erase all trace and knowledge of Doomsday from existence.&lt;ref&gt;''Action Comics'' #902 (June 2011)&lt;/ref&gt; The clones spread across the world, wreaking havoc, while Doomslayer's second plan was to entice the Doomsdays to reach the Earth's core so that he could expand the universe inside the ship's tower and destroy the planet from within, thus erasing all knowledge of Doomsday from the universe.

In [[S.T.A.R. Labs]], Superman's allies used the original Doomsday's body to try to find a way to stop the Doomsday clones. Doomsday awakened, but Eradicator (who was thought to be killed by Doomslayer) was in control. As Eradicator and the heroes attack the Doomsday clones, he warned that Doomsday's mind was beginning to awaken.&lt;ref&gt;''Action Comics'' #903 (July 2011)&lt;/ref&gt; In the final battle, a weakened Superman made contact with the ship's artificial intelligence before it reached Earth's core, hoping to have the tower teleport away. Meanwhile, the Doomsday clones were defeated by Earth's heroes and sent back into the pit in which the tower was located. Eradicator arrived and defended Superman, now very weak, from Doomslayer, quickly throwing Superman out of the tower and allowing himself to be trapped with Doomslayer before the tower teleports away.&lt;ref&gt;''Action Comics'' #904 (August 2011)&lt;/ref&gt;

===''The New 52''===
In ''[[The New 52]]'' (a 2011 reboot of the DC Comics universe), Doomsday made his official debut in September 2013 as a part of "[[Villains Month]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Khouri |first=Andy |title=DOOMSDAY: Greg Pak Brings The Superman-Killer Into The New 52 For 'Villains Month' [Interview] |url=http://www.comicsalliance.com/2013/06/05/doomsday-dc-comics-villains-month-greg-pak-interview-batman-superman/ |publisher=Comics Alliance |accessdate=June 5, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130608194527/http://www.comicsalliance.com/2013/06/05/doomsday-dc-comics-villains-month-greg-pak-interview-batman-superman/ |archivedate=June 8, 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[Batman/Superman]]'' #3.1 Doomsday attacked Krypton many years ago when [[Lara Lor-Van|Lara]] was a lieutenant in the elite military seminary. [[General Zod|Colonel Zod]] faced him wearing an ancient armor of Krypton's warrior founders but their battle caused the death of thousands of Kryptonians. Zod apparently defeated Doomsday sending him to the Phantom Zone. Years later, General Zod, now also imprisoned in the Phantom Zone, communicated with the child [[Supergirl (Kara Zor-El)|Kara Zor-El]], telling her how he admired the creature because it destroyed everything, an attribute he seeks in order for his people to be strong as years of complacency have made the Kryptonians weak. [[Zor-El]] narrates a prophecy in which the last knight of the House of El will travel to a distant planet after the destruction of Krypton. Doomsday will find and battle the last knight to save his people, but sacrificing his own life to do so.&lt;ref&gt;''Batman/Superman'' #3.1&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Superman/Wonder Woman'', Doomsday mysteriously appears in the North Atlantic Ocean and fights Wonder Woman, breaking her arm before vanishing into thin air. After describing her attacker to Superman, both travel to the Fortress of Solitude where Diana identifies Doomsday on a Phantom Zone viewing device. Superman assumes that the walls of the Phantom Zone are failing, which has allowed the momentary escapes for Doomsday.

Months later, the creature once again escapes the Phantom Zone to wreak havoc across the globe, changing as it goes into an even deadlier form; now, every living thing in its vicinity dies, and even physical structures crumble. Superman, Wonder Woman, Steel and the Justice League struggle to defeat it, even calling on the aid of Lex Luthor; in the end, Superman drags Doomsday's body to the planet Venus and incinerates it. Believing Doomsday dead, Superman returns to Earth, only to watch in horror as the creature teleports to Earth. Finally realizing he has no choice, Superman kills Doomsday, slicing the monster in half and, as it disintegrates, inhaling its ash-like remains to contain them within his indestructible body. However, soon after, he starts to change; mentally showing signs of exacerbated stress and aggression, and gradually physically as well, resembling Doomsday itself more and more. It is revealed Doomsday was released by the Phantom King (Xa-Du), on instigation of [[Brainiac (character)|Brainiac]]; the latter orchestrated it to get rid of Superman as he prepared to assimilate the consciousnesses of all human beings in the world. Superman managed to take control of the raging power and fury of Doomsday for long enough, however, to attack and defeat Brainiac's gigantic mother ship, dragging it into a black hole—ridding himself of the Doomsday infection in the process.&lt;ref&gt;''Superman: Doomed''&lt;/ref&gt;

===''DC Rebirth''===
After the death of the New 52 Superman, the pre-''[[Flashpoint (comics)|Flashpoint]]'' Superman appears to confront Lex Luthor as he attempts to proclaim his new role as Metropolis's protector in the absence of the Man of Steel, but their fight is interrupted when Doomsday emerges from a coffin that was being transported by an unidentified group in a hovercar above them.&lt;ref&gt;''Action Comics: Rebirth'' #1&lt;/ref&gt; As Superman and Lex attempt to fight the creature, Superman is troubled to realize that this Doomsday operates at a strength level similar to the creature he faced for the first time in his world, but also has some degree of strategic planning, attacking passing trains and civilians to distract Superman and Luthor.&lt;ref&gt;''Action Comics'' Vol. 1 #959&lt;/ref&gt; As Wonder Woman appears to assist, Doomsday departs, but Superman and Wonder Woman are able to intercept him before he reaches Superman's wife, Lois, and their son Jon.&lt;ref&gt;''Action Comics'' Vol. 1 #960&lt;/ref&gt; While Wonder Woman takes Lois and Jon to the JLA Watchtower for safety, Superman is confused when an unknown group appears to attack Doomsday,&lt;ref&gt;''Action Comics'' Vol. 1 #961&lt;/ref&gt; but they are swiftly defeated. He subsequently manages to lure Doomsday to his own makeshift Fortress and use the Phantom Zone projector to trap his foe, but he is unaware that the unknown group led by Mr. Oz intercepted the Phantom Zone beam and have captured Doomsday for their own unknown future purposes.&lt;ref&gt;''Action Comics'' Vol. 1 #962&lt;/ref&gt;

==Powers and abilities==

===Regenerative healing factor===
Doomsday was created through the process of repetitive cloning. The clones were subsequently killed repeatedly by some of the most dangerous species in the universe in one of the harshest habitats in all of existence: prehistoric Krypton. Through cloning technology, the infant continually returned to life and evolved, becoming resistant or immune to whatever killed him before, ultimately permanently acquiring the capability to regenerate and evolve without technology. After the Radiant killed him the first time they fought, Doomsday grew immune to the Radiant's energy-projection and even managed to withstand Darkseid's full Omega-Effect.&lt;ref name="SDHP"&gt;''Superman/Doomsday: Hunter/Prey''&lt;/ref&gt; The amount of damage dealt to Doomsday determined the length of time it took for him to fully recover. During his outwardly undamaged death at Superman's hands, he only needed some days to recover, but when [[Imperiex]] reduced him to a skeleton, it took months. His entombment in a Calatonian burial suit and metal vault lasted hundreds of millennia. After being killed by the Radiant and subsequently undergoing the impact of the casket on Earth, his body was sealed underground in total darkness. Deprived of solar energy, necessary to nourish his Kryptonian anatomy, he could only revive extremely slowly and naturally.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}

Doomsday had a highly accelerated healing factor that allowed him to quickly regenerate from most damage. When his side was cut by Superman with a plasma sword, it closed within moments. As a result of his engineering, Doomsday did not need to eat, drink, breathe, or sleep, and his body was almost solid mass with no internal organs.&lt;ref name="SDHP" /&gt;

===Resistance===
Doomsday also was able to develop/evolve resistance from ordinary injuries. Superman once used a sound gun to greatly discomfort him, but Doomsday's auditory canals closed up, making him impervious to Superman's weapon.&lt;ref name="SDHP" /&gt; [[Waverider (comics)|Waverider]] once paralyzed Doomsday with energy while seeking to perceive Doomsday's present, but the second attempt backfired as Doomsday triggered a feedback burst that briefly disrupted Waverider.&lt;ref name="SDHP" /&gt;

In essence, Doomsday gradually became more invulnerable if not injured beyond his ability to recover, which has so far been undefined. Doomsday developed weapons and abilities that countered the powers of an opponent. He managed to cancel out the pure-energy Radiant by slamming into him while generating a dark counter-energy; to greatly extend his claws and develop a poison to strike Superman in flight and reel him in;&lt;ref name="SDHP" /&gt; to breathe flames against the fire-sensitive [[Martian Manhunter]], and apparently neutralize his defensive phase-shifting power.&lt;ref name="S#175"&gt;''Superman'' (vol. 2) #175&lt;/ref&gt; Doomsday's skeleton protruded through his skin in razor-sharp spurs, which provided protection to his few vital organs (brain, eyes and nervous system), and acted as claw-like weapons on his hands, elbows, and knees. In addition, the tips of these protrusions are lethally poisonous.

Doomsday was immensely resistant to heat, cold, and conventional damage, allowing him to survive in the most inhospitable worlds, or in the vacuum of space. His superhuman endurance and invulnerability were able to withstand Darkseid's full-powered "Omega Effect" without any apparent damage.&lt;ref name="SDHP" /&gt;

Waverider's words suggest that Doomsday's body could have been completely destroyed after his battle with the Radiant, suggesting that his healing factor has its limits, but it should be noted that at this point Doomsday was left so damaged that he remained 'comatose' for several thousand years while trapped and cut off from the solar energy he required to sustain himself, making it unlikely that anything is capable of doing sufficient damage to him to bring him to this state again after his subsequent evolutions.&lt;ref name="SDHP" /&gt;

===Strength===
Doomsday possessed extreme superhuman strength that, variable as it was, at one point enabled him to effortlessly stand his ground against the entire Justice League, including Superman and [[Orion (comics)|Orion]].&lt;ref name="TDW"&gt;''The Doomsday Wars''&lt;/ref&gt; He was able to break Superman's left arm with limited effort, as well as outmatch and beat Darkseid unconscious in combat.&lt;ref name="SDHP" /&gt; However, his strength has limits: the immensely strong Calatonian alloy cables, in which he was entombed, continued to partially restrain him during his initial rampage on Earth, with the last of the cables only being destroyed when the Justice League unleashed a full-power assault to try and stop him. It was never stated how long he had struggled to free his left hand before his escape.

Doomsday possessed seemingly inexhaustible stamina, and was not noticeably slowed down from fighting Superman for an entire day. His speed and agility were vastly disproportionate to his bulky stature, and he was able to match Superman in this regard, once even managing to grab the [[Wally West|Flash]] while the hero was in motion. He could not fly, but traveled by leaping miles at a time. Superman took advantage of this in their first battle by trying to keep him airborne by flying into the sky.

After being regrown by Lex Luthor, Doomsday was genetically part-[[Kryptonian]] due to his genes having been spliced with Kal-El's. However, with the exception of his flame-breath, he displayed no additional abilities. In fact, he was shown to be weaker than previously when he was single-handedly beaten by Superman. This was attributed to intelligence that he developed, causing him to fear the death that awaited him if he lost, but did not explain how a simple minor [[concussion]] could incapacitate his healing factor for the time he remained unconscious.&lt;ref name="S#175" /&gt; However, he apparently lost his intelligence when he was sent back in time, reverting him to his original state of fearlessness.{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}}

Once he gained some of Superman's Kryptonian DNA, he became susceptible to [[kryptonite]]. Unlike Superman, it caused him pain, but could not kill him.{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}} This rendered him controllable.

===Other powers===
During his confrontation with Steel, Doomsday spontaneously developed the power of flight, and the ability to cover his body with metallic armor, capable of resisting even Steel's paralyzing [[Nanorobotics|nanites]].&lt;ref&gt;''Reign of Doomsday: Steel'' #1&lt;/ref&gt; In a later confrontation with the [[Outsiders (comics)|Outsiders]], as he sought to confront the [[Eradicator (comics)|Eradicator]], he demonstrated the ability to absorb energy from [[Looker (comics)|Looker]] and [[Halo (comics)|Halo]]'s attacks and send it back to them in a massive burst manipulating raw power like the Eradicator.&lt;ref&gt;''Outsiders'' #37&lt;/ref&gt; During his battle with the Cyborg-Superman, the Cyborg tore through portions of Doomsday's body, which were quickly replaced with bionic parts of his own, giving itself vast technopathy.&lt;ref&gt;''Superman/Batman Annual'' #5&lt;/ref&gt; And again, when confronting Superboy, the monster showcased a blue glow in its eyes, indicating Tactile Telekinesis power even greater than his own.&lt;ref&gt;''Superboy'' #6&lt;/ref&gt; However, it has since been revealed that these Doomsdays were actually clones of the original, each specifically designed to take out Steel, Henshaw, Eradicator and Superboy, putting them at a disadvantage when pitted against the other Supermen.&lt;ref&gt;''Action Comics'' #900&lt;/ref&gt; 

In the DCnU revamp, Doomsday was revealed to grow and evolve in stages since its genesis. Growing as well as gaining in biomass and power over the course of its own development cycle, it was soon revealed that when it killed Superman post reboot, it was only in its larval stage.&lt;ref&gt;''Superman: Doomed'' #1&lt;/ref&gt; While undergoing its adolescence phase, the monster created a giant clump of its own biomass as a makeshift cocoon, which steadily built up its physiological structure to its current state by feeding on the natural wildlife around it. Whence it hatched from its incubator, Doomsday became only that much greater an extinction level threat. Now, able to move to and from the phantom zone at will, using it as a hub for spontaneous teleportation.&lt;ref&gt;''Superman/Wonder Woman'' #2&lt;/ref&gt; This was made possible due to its physical strength being vastly augmented to the point it could breach the dimensional barrier through physical force alone.&lt;ref&gt;''Batman/Superman'' #11&lt;/ref&gt; He'd grown so powerful in such a short amount of time that the creature could overpower the demigoddess Diana of Themyscira in a straight forward battle with ease, going so far as to break both of her arms.&lt;ref&gt;''Superman/Wonder Woman'' Vol 1 #2&lt;/ref&gt; 

Doomsday was still in the stages of his evolution, to help it along he developed a form of death aura which sapped the life out of anything and everything around him within a couple hundred yards.&lt;ref&gt;''Action Comics'' (Volume 2) #16&lt;/ref&gt; Growing more and more powerful the more he killed and the more lifeforce he consumed, an extension of this power was a toxic spore cloud he emitted from his own body which expedited the leeching process. Doomsday's deadly miasma had the effect of making everything around him wither and die at an accelerated rate; such as sand glossing over into black onyx, sentient life burst' into flames several meters away, even buildings spontaneously dissolving at a molecular level upon exposure to his poisonous fugue. Even a solar powered Kryptonian couldn't stand to be in his presence for more than a few minutes at a time.&lt;ref&gt;''Action Comics'' (Volume 2) #17&lt;/ref&gt; The virulent also has the effect of turning anyone and everyone affected by it into an iteration of Doomsday himself.&lt;ref&gt;''Doomed'' #1&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, those who kill him become a receptacle for his essential self, taking on his more vicious and bloodthirsty characteristics as well as his powers.&lt;ref&gt;''Action Comics'' (Volume 2) #33&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other versions==
* In the non-continuity book ''[[All-Star Superman]]'', [[Grant Morrison]]'s modern take on the [[Silver Age of Comic Books|Silver Age]] includes the [[Project Cadmus|D.N.A. P.R.O.J.E.C.T.]], which is resurrected by a scientist named Leo Quintum. Under Quintum's guidance, the P.R.O.J.E.C.T. was dedicated to "the engineering of new human forms" including [[Bizarro]] worker drones, giants called "Voyager Titans" who could travel through space under their own power, and microscopic "nanonauts" who could unlock the mysteries of the sub-atomic world. The P.R.O.J.E.C.T.'s ultimate goal was to create a replacement Superman, in case something were to happen to the original. In ''All-Star Superman'' #4, it was revealed that the P.R.O.J.E.C.T. (with support from the U.S. Army's Cadmus Division) created a formula to bestow Superman-level strength and durability on a normal human, but all of their test subjects ultimately burned out. [[Jimmy Olsen]] shot himself with a syringe gun containing a formula marked "Do Not Open Until Doomsday", and transformed into a hulking, gray-skinned figure with bony protrusions. He succeeded in stopping a black [[kryptonite]]-afflicted Superman and transformed back into his normal form before the formula had a chance to kill him. It is not discussed as to whether Superman fought an original Doomsday in this universe.&lt;ref&gt;''All Star Superman'' #4&lt;/ref&gt;
* The Doomsday of the [[Bizarro World]] was assumed to become weaker to things (due to Doomsday developing resistance).
* During the "Lifeline" storyline that ran in ''[[Wonder Woman]]'', an imperfect duplicate of Doomsday was created by an artificial intelligence based on the son of scientist Doctor Julian Lazarus,&lt;ref&gt;''Wonder Woman'' vol. 2 #104&lt;/ref&gt; but was destroyed when Wonder Woman's allies were able to feed the clone so much power that its bones covered it and it reverted to a statue-like state that she could shatter with relative ease.&lt;ref&gt;''Wonder Woman'' vol.2 #106&lt;/ref&gt;
* In an attempt to understand death, [[Mister Mxyzptlk]] created a temporary copy of Doomsday, which he called "Bada-Bing-Bada-Boomsday", although he erased it once again after it temporarily killed ''him''. This version had light yellow skin instead of the grey tinge of the mainstream version, in addition to more spikes.&lt;ref&gt;''Superman: The Man of Steel'' #75&lt;/ref&gt;
* In the [[Tangent Comics|Tangent Universe]], Doomsday was a member of the [[Doom Patrol]].&lt;ref&gt;''Tangent Comics: Doom Patrol'' #1&lt;/ref&gt;
* In ''[[JLA/Avengers]]'' #4 Doomsday was shown in a panel near the end of the heroes' battle against [[Krona (comics)|Krona]]'s enthralled army of villains, where he was apparently defeated by [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]].&lt;ref&gt;''JLA/Avengers'' #1-4&lt;/ref&gt;
* In the ''[[Young Justice]]'' crossover story "World Without Young Justice", the past of all of the team members was changed. [[Superboy (Kon-El)|Superboy]] was now one of two clone attempts after Superman's death. His nemesis was a teenage version of Doomsday known as "Doomsboy".&lt;ref&gt;''Young Justice'' #40-45&lt;/ref&gt;
* In ''[[Action Comics]]'' #856, a [[Bizarro|Bizarro No. 1]] created a "Bizarro Doomsday".&lt;ref&gt;''[[Action Comics]]'' #856&lt;/ref&gt;
* In the ''Superboy'' story "Hypertension" (vol 3 #60-65), [[Black Zero]] had a collection of dozens of Doomsdays from alternate realities.&lt;ref&gt;''Superboy'' #60-65&lt;/ref&gt;
* In ''[[Superman: Red Son]]'', Doomsday was one of the many rogues created by [[Lex Luthor|Dr. Luthor]].&lt;ref&gt;''Superman: Red Son'' #1-3&lt;/ref&gt;
* A Doomsday-like creature codenamed "All-American Boy", was introduced in the ''[[Superman/Batman]]'' storyline "The Search for Kryptonite".&lt;ref&gt;''Superman/Batman'' #44-49&lt;/ref&gt; All-American Boy was an experiment to use kryptonite to bond cell scrapings taken from Doomsday to a human host (Joshua Walker).&lt;ref&gt;''Superman/Batman'' #47&lt;/ref&gt; Walker, a local [[Smallville (comics)|Smallville]] hero turned soldier, under mind control battled Superman, devastating [[Smallville (comics)|Smallville, Kansas]], in the process. [[Batman]] located Josh's parents, who convinced him to stop, and he regained consciousness. Project leader [[Amanda Waller]] was forced to contribute towards the repairs of Smallville in return for her dealings in the AAB project to remain secret.&lt;ref&gt;''Superman/Batman'' #48&lt;/ref&gt;
* In the ''Superman/Batman'' storyline "Mash-Up", elements of Doomsday were combined with parts of [[Deathstroke]], creating the villain "Doomstroke".&lt;ref&gt;''Superman/Batman'' #60&lt;/ref&gt;
* In the alternate timeline of the ''[[Flashpoint (comics)|Flashpoint]]'' event, Doomsday was part of the military's "Project Six". After being discovered lying dormant in an underground vault, Project Six's DNA was used by the government's [[List of minor DC Comics characters#Sam Lane|Sam Lane]] to create [[supersoldier]]s. The volunteer supersoldier was [[Apollo (comics)|Neil Sinclair]].&lt;ref&gt;''Flashpoint: Project Superman #1 (June 2011)''&lt;/ref&gt; Later, Project Six, controlled by General [[Captain Atom|Nathaniel Adam]] via a mental interface, was sent to attack [[Booster Gold]], who was believed to be an [[Atlantis (DC Comics)|Atlantean]] threat.&lt;ref&gt;''Booster Gold'' vol. 2 #44 (May 2011)&lt;/ref&gt; During the battle, Adam's control device was disrupted by a [[Metahuman]] woman named Alexandra Gianopoulos, which caused Project Six's true personality to surface.&lt;ref&gt;''Booster Gold'' vol. 2 #45 (June 2011)&lt;/ref&gt; Project Six attacked and nearly beat Booster Gold to death, with Booster only survived because Project Six was at a more basic level of evolution than the Doomsday with which Booster was familiar. With the immediate threat defeated, Project Six began to rampage, killing innocent people, but after regaining consciousness, Booster Gold put Project Six's helmet back on, returning control back to General Adam. However, the General, believing that Project Six was naturally mindless and incapable of doing anything without being under the control of something else, attributed its rampage to Booster, commanding Project Six to capture him.&lt;ref&gt;''Booster Gold'' vol. 2 #46 (July 2011)&lt;/ref&gt; When General Adam attempted to have Booster Gold subjected to mind-crippling interrogation due to his disbelief of Booster's story, Booster Gold shot down a girder, knocking the control helmet off him. At the same time, an image of "Project Superman" appeared on a computer screen. The two events caused Project Six's true personality to resurface again. As Project Six rampaged, badly beating Booster Gold, Alexandra put on the control helmet, forcing him to rip open his own chest, killing himself.&lt;ref&gt;''Booster Gold'' (vol. 2) #47 (August 2011)&lt;/ref&gt;
* Doomsday prominently appeared in ''[[Injustice: Gods Among Us]]'' prequel comic. While entering a submarine looking for a captured [[Lois Lane]], Superman encountered him. He grabbed Doomsday and flew into outer space with him, assuming that this action would be nonlethal. In all actuality however, this supposed "Doomsday" was Lois Lane. Superman was under the effects of [[Scarecrow (DC Comics)|Scarecrow]]'s fear toxin, causing him to interpret Lois as Doomsday. [[Joker (character)|Joker]] had previously set a nuclear bomb in Metropolis to Lane's heartbeat. If she were to die, the bomb would detonate. The effects of the toxin wore off, and Superman watched in horror as Lois perished (along with their unborn son) and Metropolis exploded as a result of his actions. This had a traumatic effect on Superman, causing him to have a new outlook on morality and setting the events of the game's story in motion.&lt;ref&gt;''Injustice: Gods Among Men'' #2&lt;/ref&gt; The true Doomsday was later captured and kept under control with a special harness that limited his ability to act independently.
* In the ''[[DC Bombshells]]'' continuity, [[Faora]] injects herself with Raven's blood from when Raven transformed into an unstable demonic monster after her father's death, altering her body to turn herself into this dimension's version of Doomsday.

Created as [[General Zod]]'s and [[Faora]]'s "son" from the strongest creatures' DNA on Krypton, this version had the human-esque [[alter ego]] "'''[[Davis Bloome]]'''" ([[Sam Witwer]]) that mutated into the recognizable monster form and blacked out for the periods when Doomsday was active, and was portrayed as a "[[Villain|tragic villain]]" rather than a completely uncontrollable monster.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode|title=Bloodline|series=Smallville|credits=Caroline Dries (writer) and Michael Rohl (director)|network=The CW|airdate=November 6, 2008|season=8|number=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; When [[Clark Kent (Smallville)|Clark Kent]]'s secret is revealed to the world, Davis realized Clark was the Kryptonian he had been sent to kill; Clark then went back in time and altered history so Davis never learned this,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode|title=Infamous|series=Smallville|credits=Caroline Dries (writer) &amp; Glen Winter (director)|network=The CW|airdate=March 12, 2009|season=8|number=15}}&lt;/ref&gt; resulting in Davis increasingly struggling to control his alter ego as he and Clark discover their connection to each other. In the season finale, [[Chloe Sullivan]] splits Davis and Doomsday using [[Black Kryptonite|black kryptonite]] and Clark is able to trap Doomsday deep below the Earth while keeping Davis alive, believing Davis could be saved. However, Davis snaps anyway and kills [[Jimmy Olsen]]. Before he could kill Chloe, Jimmy pushes Davis onto spikes, impaling and killing him before Jimmy succumbs to his own wounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode|title=Doomsday|series=Smallville|credits=Brian Peterson, Kelly Souders (writers) &amp; James Marshall (director)|network=The CW|airdate=May 14, 2009|season=8|number=22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jimmy's death at Davis's hands sends Clark into a state of depression as Clark chose to save Davis rather than kill as originally stressed by colleagues until Chloe manages to make Clark see this error.
* Doomsday appears in ''[[Krypton (TV series)|Krypton]]''. In this version, he is a super-weapon created by the Zods and the Els, kept in cryogenic stasis to keep him from waking up and destroying Kandor. In the sixth episode of season 1 "Civil Wars", when [[Seg-El]] wants to use him, [[Adam Strange|Adam]] is forced to convince him of the danger Doomsday posed in the future, having only been stopped by an already-matured Superman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://comicbook.com/dc/2017/07/22/krypton-tv-doomsday/|title=Doomsday Set To Appear On Television Series Krypton|author=|date=July 22, 2017|website=Comic Book|accessdate=August 7, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the final scene of episode 10 "The Phantom Zone", Doomsday breaks free of his cage.

* Doomsday was considered to make an appearance in ''[[Superman: The Animated Series]]'', but [[Paul Dini]] refused to include Doomsday.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldsfinestonline.com/WF/sections/backstage/unused/superman/doomsday.php Unused Villains Database - Doomsday] at The World's Finest&lt;/ref&gt; 
* Doomsday appears in ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]'', voiced by [[Michael Jai White]]. It's revealed that this version was actually an altered clone of [[Superman]] genetically engineered by [[Project Cadmus]] to be the Man of Steel's superior and indoctrinated into hatred. When he became too difficult to control, Cadmus abandoned the project and launched Doomsday into space in a rocket. His strength, however, had been underestimated, and he was able to damage his rocket-propelled prison cell enough before it could leave the planet's orbit, causing it to crash back on Earth (with its remains being the 'meteorite' seen in his earlier appearance). The episode "The Doomsday Sanction" revealed that Cadmus extracted Doomsday after being defeated and kept him prisoner. After Doomsday's brain had regenerated, disgraced and enraged Cadmus member [[Professor Milo|Dr. Achilles Milo]] released Doomsday to kill [[Amanda Waller]] after explaining that Doomsday's hatred of Superman was manufactured. However, Doomsday killed Milo (off-screen) instead and went to fight Superman. Like his comic book counterpart, his skull had adapted a heavy bone-plate to prevent the same trick from working twice. After a brutal fight, Doomsday is defeated when Superman threw him into an [[active volcano]], encasing him in lava. The [[Justice League]] then tried to get some answers from the captured Doomsday regarding Cadmus, which did not work as Doomsday was unaffected by [[Martian Manhunter]]'s telepathy. Superman then resorted to sending Doomsday into the [[Phantom Zone]], since he's too dangerous to imprison anywhere else.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9GoX98qxJX4 |title=JLU Superman vs. Doomsday full fight on YouTube |publisher=Youtube.com |date= |accessdate=2011-01-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Doomsday also appeared briefly in the ''[[Legion of Super Heroes (TV series)|Legion of Super Heroes]]'' animated series. In the episode "Phantoms", he's shown as a prisoner within the Phantom Zone along with many other Phantom Zone villains.

* [[Robin Atkin Downes]] voices and provides motion-capture for Doomsday in the 2016 film ''[[Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Robin Atkin Downes |url=https://twitter.com/Robin_A_Downes/status/703245558652080129 |title="Very proud to release that I helped bring #Doomsday to life in the upcoming @BatmanvSuperman #Dreamgigs" |publisher=Twitter.com |date=2016-02-26 |accessdate=2016-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; After learning Kryptonian information from the historical archives on a scout ship that crashed, [[Lex Luthor in other media|Lex Luthor]] uses '''[[General Zod]]''''s body to create a "Kryptonian Deformity", an act which had been forbidden by the Kryptonian Council prior to the planet's destruction. Luthor places the lifeless corpse into the Genesis Chamber and gives the creature life with his own blood. In the climax of the film, Luthor sets the creature loose upon hatching from its "egg sack" to kill Superman, after Batman fails to do so, deeming the creature the Man of Steel's "Doomsday". During the battle, Doomsday displays massive superhuman strength, durability and stamina, as well as the ability to "evolve" and regenerate at an incredibly fast pace, growing bone protrusions and gaining more muscle mass, in addition to being able to absorb energy and fire heat blasts from his eyes and mouth. When Superman flies the monster into space and the military fires a [[nuclear missile]] with the hopes of incinerating him, Doomsday survives and absorbs the nuclear energy, gaining the ability to discharge electrical blasts from his body, capable of levelling a few city blocks at once. Although [[Wonder Woman]] soon joins the battle, Doomsday's strength proves to be far greater than that of the two heroes combined. However, Batman later surmises that because Doomsday was created from Kryptonian technology, he shares Superman's vulnerability to kryptonite. Lois retrieves the spear while Wonder Woman cuts off Doomsday's right hand and holds him down using the Lasso of Truth and Batman uses his last kryptonite round to weaken the monster.  Doomsday is then killed when Superman impales him with Batman's kryptonite spear, but not before the creature gets a chance to stab the hero with a new large bone protrusion from his severed wrist, resulting in the demise of both characters. However Superman was later resurrected in ''[[Justice League (film)|Justice League]]'' in the chamber used to create Doomsday.&lt;ref name="Doomsday"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/article/new-batman-v-superman-trailer-debuts-never-before-seen-footage|title=DOOMSDAY ARRIVES IN NEW "BATMAN V SUPERMAN" TRAILER|author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line--&gt;|publisher=[[Comic Book Resources]]|date=December 3, 2015|accessdate=December 3, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bustle.com/articles/149261-16-batman-v-superman-spoilers-for-those-too-eager-to-wait 16 'Batman v Superman' Spoilers For Those Too Eager To Wait]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Animation====
* Doomsday appears in the 2007 animated [[direct-to-video]] film ''[[Superman: Doomsday]]''. Like his first appearance in the comics, he did not speak but only roared. Doomsday's origin was simplified, with a [[Superman robots|Superman robot]] informing Superman that Kryptonian records reporting him as an improperly programmed Doomsday [[biomechanics|biomechanical]] supersoldier, a literal [[weapon of mass destruction]] or [[doomsday device]], one which could not determine friend from foe, destroying everyone and everything in sight "because it ''must''". After going on a killing spree, it was engaged in battle by Superman throughout Metropolis. Doomsday was finally defeated when a severely wounded Superman flew him into outer space, then returned with him, slamming him into the pavement and killing him. The blast resulted in the mortal wounding of Superman, though Superman's condition was discovered by [[Kelex|the robot]] to be merely a deathlike reduced metabolic healing state. Unlike the comics, there was nothing to indicate Doomsday returned from the dead.
* An army of Doomsday clones appear in ''[[Superman/Batman: Apocalypse]]''. They are created by Darkseid and sent to attack [[Themyscira (DC Comics)|Themyscira]]. However, these clones are significantly weaker than the original Doomsday. After a lengthy battle, the Doomsday clones are all killed when Superman uses his heat vision to incinerate them. After the battle, the heroes realize the clones were only used to distract them as Darkseid killed [[Harbinger (DC Comics)|Lyla]] and kidnapped Kara Zor-El.
* Doomsday appears in a two-part animated film that serves as a faithful re-adaptation of ''The Death of Superman'' set in the animated movie continuity that began in ''[[Justice League: The Flashpoint Paradox]]'' and ''[[Justice League: War]]''. In the first part, titled ''[[The Death of Superman (film)|The Death of Superman]]'', meteorite holding Doomsday emerged from a Boom Tube and crashes to Earth while obliterating Hank Henshaw's shuttle. Doomsday, whose containment suit is gradually destroyed, goes on a killing rampage and overpowers the Justice League while reaching Metropolis where Superman confronts the monster. Throughout the fight, Doomsday continually adapts and gains new abilities to combat his opponents. The resulting long brawl takes its toll on Superman's physical wellbeing before Lois's attempt to save Superman provokes Doomsday to execute her via a bone protrusion, with Superman putting all his strength into a punch that managed to kill Doomsday at the cost of being impaled in the chest. By the end of the movie, Doomsday's corpse is in custody of S.T.A.R. Labs before it can be jettisoned into the sun.

====Web videos====
* Doomsday appears in the 2012 short film ''[[The Death and Return of Superman (film)|The Death and Return of Superman]]'' by [[Max Landis]]. Doomsday, played by [[Elden Henson]], is created by [[Bertron]] and later goes to Metropolis and kills Superman.

===Video games===
* Doomsday appeared in ''[[The Death and Return of Superman]]'' video game adaptation of the major comic book storyline of the same name, appearing as the second boss in the game.
* A Doomsday clone appeared in ''[[Justice League Heroes]]'', voiced by Charles Gideon Davis. [[Brainiac (character)|Brainiac]] unleashed him into the [[Justice League Satellite]] where he knocked out Martian Manhunter until he was defeated by the heroes.
* Doomsday appeared in ''[[DC Universe Online]]'', voiced by Benjamin Jansen. In the "Smallville Alert", LexCorp had been performing an experiment that involved using Doomsday's DNA on some of Smallville's citizens, resulting in their becoming Doomsday-like creatures. After the players defeated the Doomsday-like creatures and the LexCorp Scientists, the players stops the DNA transfer from Doomsday, which also frees him so he must be fought and trapped again. On the hero campaign when it came to the fight against Doomsday, the players would be assisted by [[Black Canary]], [[Green Arrow]], [[Red Tornado]], and [[Steel (John Henry Irons)|Steel]]. On the villain campaign when it came to the fight against Doomsday, the players would be assisted by [[Bizarro]], [[Deathstroke]], [[Killer Frost]], and [[Solomon Grundy (comics)|Solomon Grundy]].
**Doomsday is unleashed in the [[Kandor (comics)|Kandor]] Central Tower raid by [[Lex Luthor]].
**A more modern version of Doomsday is the primary antagonist of the episode "The Death of Superman", now carrying a spore plague courtesy of Xa-Du. He must be fought and forced to retreat as a daily mission. He is also fought in the eponymous "Doomsday" raid where, upon defeat, he will also apparently kill Superman in a mutual blow.
* Doomsday appears in ''[[Injustice: Gods Among Us]]'', voiced by [[Khary Payton]]. He was revealed to be a playable character after a glitch on [[GameStop]]'s site (which was promoting the game) caused the information to be leaked. In the story, Doomsday was among the villains battling the Justice League on the "Prime Earth" before being defeated and thrown far into space by Superman. On the parallel Regime-dominated Earth, the alternate Doomsday was captured by Superman's Regime and kept tame by the use of a control collar. Later, Doomsday was used by the alternate Superman in his attack on Metropolis when people began to rebel against the Regime's rule and was defeated by the "Prime" Superman. The "Prime" Superman claims that "Doomsday is not today" and throws Doomsday into the Phantom Zone. In Doomsday's ending, Doomsday used technology in the Fortress of Solitude to terraform Earth into the image of prehistoric Krypton. Eventually, Doomsday departed Earth seeking a challenge and finding it in the form of the intergalactic mercenary [[Lobo (DC Comics)|Lobo]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5153">'''Fadel Shana'a''' (27 March 1984 – 16 April 2008) was a [[Palestinian people|Palestinian]] journalist working as a [[cameraman]] for [[Reuters]]. He was killed, along with eight bystanders (aged 12 to 20)&lt;ref name="ReutersShana'a"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/2008/08/13/uk-palestinians-israel-journalist-idUKLD61073920080813 |title=Israel clears troops who killed Reuters cameraman |publisher=[[Reuters]] |date=13 August 2008 |accessdate=1 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; by a [[flechette]] shell fired by an [[Israel]]i [[tank]] in the [[Gaza Strip]] (the [[Al Bureij massacre]]).

Shana'a's video footage shows the tank firing and a glimpse of the incoming shell before going black at the moment of impact.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.reuters.com/article/video/idUSL1632826120080416?videoId=80475 Reuters cameraman killed in Gaza]&lt;/ref&gt; The then Reuters Editor-in-chief [[David Schlesinger]] called for an investigation, as did [[Human Rights Watch]], whose Middle East director stated, "Israeli soldiers did not make sure they were aiming at a military target before firing, and there is evidence suggesting they actually targeted the journalists."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.hrw.org/news/2008/04/18/israel-investigate-death-gaza-civilians |title=Israel: Investigate Death of Gaza Civilians |publisher=[[Human Rights Watch]] |date=19 April 2008 |accessdate=1 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Al Mezan Center for Human Rights]] denounced the killing as a deliberate [[war crime]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mezan.org/en/details.php?id=1606 |title=Al Mezan Denounces IOF's Deliberate Killing of Journalist Fadel Shana'a |publisher=[[Al Mezan Center for Human Rights]] |date=17 April 2008 |accessdate=1 January 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140102194156/http://www.mezan.org/en/details.php?id=1606 |archivedate=2 January 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Israel Defense Forces]] (IDF) released a statement saying "The IDF wishes to emphasize that unlike terrorist organizations, not only does it not deliberately target uninvolved civilians, it also uses means to avoid such incidents... Reports claiming the opposite are false and misleading."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/04/22/world/middleeast/22gaza.html |title=Israel to Investigate Killing of Newsman in Clash in Gaza |publisher=[[The New York Times]] |date=22 April 2008 |accessdate=1 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 13 August 2008, it was reported that the IDF had closed an investigation into the death of Shana'a without taking disciplinary action against the tank crew that killed him.&lt;ref name="ReutersShana'a"/&gt; "In light of the reasonable conclusion reached by the tank crew and its superiors, that the characters were hostile and were carrying an object most likely to be a weapon, the decision to fire at the targets ... was sound",&lt;ref name="ReutersShana'a"/&gt; the then Chief [[Military Advocate General]] [[Avichai Mandelblit]] said in a letter sent to Reuters. David Schlesinger said that "I'm extremely disappointed that this report condones a disproportionate use of deadly force in a situation the army itself admitted had not been analysed clearly" and "They would appear to take the view that any raising of a camera into position could garner a deadly response". In a statement issued at its London headquarters, Reuters said the army probe could effectively give soldiers a "free hand to kill," without being sure of the identity of their targets.&lt;ref name="ReutersShana'a"/&gt;

'''Faithfulness''' is the concept of unfailingly remaining [[loyalty|loyal]] to someone or something, and putting that loyalty into consistent practice regardless of extenuating circumstances. It may be exhibited by a [[husband]] or [[wife]] who, in a sexually exclusive marriage, does not engage in [[adultery|sexual relationships outside of the marriage]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/faithful |title=Faithful Meaning in the Cambridge English Dictionary |publisher=[[Cambridge Advanced Learner's Dictionary]] |accessdate=October 15, 2018 |deadurl=no }}&lt;/ref&gt; It can also mean keeping to one's promises no matter the prevailing circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/faithful |title=Definition of faithful |publisher=[[Merriam Webster]] |accessdate=June 7, 2018 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Literally, it is the state of being full of [[faith (disambiguation)|faith]] in the sense of steady devotion to a person, thing or concept.

== Etymology ==
Its [[etymology]] is distantly related to that of [[fidelity]]; indeed, in modern electronic devices, a machine with high "fidelity" is considered "faithful" to its source material,{{cn|date=September 2018}} whereas a spouse who, inside a sexually exclusive relationship, has sexual relations outside of marriage could equally be considered as being "unfaithful" as having committed "infidelity".&lt;ref&gt; David M Newman, Elizabeth Grauerholz, ''Sociology of Families'', Pine Forge Press, USA, 2002, p. 267&lt;/ref&gt;

== Religions ==
Faithfulness in the marriage is a [[Theological virtues|virtue]] in [[Christianity]]. In [[Catholicism]], it is one of the four pillars of marriage.&lt;ref&gt; Catechism of the Catholic Church, [http://www.vatican.va/archive/ccc_css/archive/catechism/p2s2c3a7.htm The sacrament of Matrimony], Official Website, Vatican, Retrieved May 27, 2017&lt;/ref&gt; In other Christian churches ([[Orthodoxy]], [[Protestantism]], [[Evangelicalism]]), it is an ethical invitation.&lt;ref&gt; Gerald R. McDermott, ''The Oxford Handbook of Evangelical Theology'', Oxford University Press, UK, 2013, p. 453&lt;/ref&gt;{{definition|date=September 2018}} It is a commitment in [[Jewish]] marriage,&lt;ref&gt; Don S. Browning, M. Christian. Green, John Witte Jr., ''Sex, Marriage, and Family in World Religions'', Columbia University Press , USA, 2009, p. 2&lt;/ref&gt; and an obligation of [[Islam]].&lt;ref&gt; Ina Taylor, ''Religion and Life with Christianity and Islam'', Heinemann, UK, 2005, p. 50&lt;/ref&gt;

{{DISPLAYTITLE:H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-translocating pyrophosphatase family}}
Members of the '''H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-translocating Pyrophosphatase (M&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;''-PPase)'' Family''' ([http://www.tcdb.org/search/result.php?tc=3.a.10 TC# 3.A.10]) are found in the vacuolar ([[Vacuole|tonoplast]]) membranes of higher plants, [[algae]], and [[protozoa]], and in both bacteria and [[archaea]]. They are therefore ancient enzymes.

== Classification ==
Full-length members of the H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-PPase family have been sequenced from numerous bacteria, archaea and eukaryotes. These H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; pumping enzymes, which are probably homodimeric, have been reported to fall into two phylogenetic subfamilies.&lt;ref name="Belogurov_2002"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Belogurov GA, Turkina MV, Penttinen A, Huopalahti S, Baykov AA, Lahti R | title = H+-pyrophosphatase of Rhodospirillum rubrum.

Those from respiratory and photosynthetic bacteria as well as archaea are less dependent upon K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;. However, exceptions may exist.&lt;ref name="Belogurov_2002" /&gt; It is not sure whether K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; is transported.

The archaeon, ''[[Methanosarcina]]'' ''mazei'' Gö1, encodes within its genome two H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-translocating [[pyrophosphatase]]s (PPases), Mvp1 and Mvp2. Mvp1 resembles bacterial PPases while Mvp2 resembles plant PPases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bäumer S, Lentes S, Gottschalk G, Deppenmeier U | title = Identification and analysis of proton-translocating pyrophosphatases in the methanogenic archaeon Methansarcina mazei | journal = Archaea | volume = 1 | issue = 1 | pages = 1–7 | date = March 2002 | pmid = 15803653 | pmc = 2685546 | doi = 10.1155/2002/371325 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Mvp2 was shown to translocate 1 H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; per pyrophosphate hydrolyzed.

Some PPases from ''[[Anaerostipes caccae]]'', ''Chlorobium limicola'', ''[[Clostridium tetani]]'', and ''[[Desulfuromonas acetoxidans]]'' have been identified as K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-dependent Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; transporters.&lt;ref name="Luoto_2011"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Luoto HH, Belogurov GA, Baykov AA, Lahti R, Malinen AM | title = Na+-translocating membrane pyrophosphatases are widespread in the microbial world and evolutionarily precede H+-translocating pyrophosphatases | journal = The Journal of Biological Chemistry | volume = 286 | issue = 24 | pages = 21633–42 | date = June 2011 | pmid = 21527638 | pmc = 3283130 | doi = 10.1074/jbc.M111.244483 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Phylogenetic analysis led to the identification of a monophyletic clade comprising characterized and predicted Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-transporting PPases (Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-PPases) within the K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-dependent subfamily. H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-transporting PPases (H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-PPases) are more heterogeneous and form at least three independent clades in both subfamilies.&lt;ref name="Luoto_2011" /&gt;

== Function ==
The plant enzymes probably pump one H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; upon hydrolysis of pyrophosphate, thereby generating a [[proton motive force]], positive and acidic in the tonoplast lumen. They establish a pmf of similar magnitude to that generated by the H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-translocating ATPases in the same vacuolar membrane. The bacterial and archaeal proteins may catalyze fully reversible reactions, thus being able to synthesize pyrophosphate when the pmf is sufficient. The enzyme from ''R. rubrum'' contributes to the pmf when light intensity is insufficient to generate a pmf sufficient in magnitude to support rapid ATP synthesis. Both C-termini of the [[Protein dimer|dimeric]] subunits of V-PPase are on the same side of the membrane, and they are close to each other.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Liu TH, Hsu SH, Huang YT, Lin SM, Huang TW, Chuang TH, Fan SK, Fu CC, Tseng FG, Pan RL | title = The proximity between C-termini of dimeric vacuolar H+-pyrophosphatase determined using atomic force microscopy and a gold nanoparticle technique | journal = The FEBS Journal | volume = 276 | issue = 16 | pages = 4381–94 | date = August 2009 | pmid = 19614743 | doi = 10.1111/j.1742-4658.2009.07146.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; Transmembrane domain 6 of vacuolar H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-[[pyrophosphatase]] appears to mediate both protein targeting and proton transport.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Pan YJ, Lee CH, Hsu SH, Huang YT, Lee CH, Liu TH, Chen YW, Lin SM, Pan RL | title = The transmembrane domain 6 of vacuolar H(+)-pyrophosphatase mediates protein targeting and proton transport | journal = Biochimica et Biophysica Acta | volume = 1807 | issue = 1 | pages = 59–67 | date = January 2011 | pmid = 20937245 | doi = 10.1016/j.bbabio.2010.10.006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The generalized transport reaction catalyzed by H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-PPases is:&lt;blockquote&gt;pyrophosphate (P&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O + H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; (cytoplasm) → inorganic phosphate (2 P&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;) + H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; (external milieu or vacuolar lumen).&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Structure ==
Eukaryotic members of the H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-PPase family are large proteins of about 770 amino acyl residues (aas) with fifteen or sixteen putative transmembrane α-helical spanners (TMSs). The N-termini are predicted to be in the vacuolar lumen while the C-termini are thought to be in the cytoplasm. These proteins exhibit a region that shows convincing sequence similarity to the regions surrounding the DCCD-sensitive glutamate in the C-terminal regions of the c-subunits of F-type ATPases ([http://www.tcdb.org/search/result.php?tc=3.A.2 TC #3.A.2]). The H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-pyrophosphatase of ''[[Streptomyces coelicolor]]'' has been shown to have a 17 TMS topology with the substrate binding domain exposed to the cytoplasm. The C-terminus is hydrophilic with a single C-terminal TMS. The basic structure is believed to have 16 TMSs with several large cytoplasmic loops containing functional motifs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Mimura H, Nakanishi Y, Hirono M, Maeshima M | title = Membrane topology of the H+-pyrophosphatase of Streptomyces coelicolor determined by cysteine-scanning mutagenesis | journal = The Journal of Biological Chemistry | volume = 279 | issue = 33 | pages = 35106–12 | date = August 2004 | pmid = 15187077 | doi = 10.1074/jbc.M406264200 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Several acidic residues in the ''[[Arabidopsis]]'' H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-PPase have been shown to be important for function. Some plants possess closely related H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-PPase isoforms. These enzymes have the enzyme commission number [[EC 3.6.1.1]].

Lin et al. (2012) reported the crystal structure of a ''[[Vigna radiata]]'' H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-PPase (VrH&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-PPase) in complex with a non-hydrolysable substrate analogue, imidodiphosphate (IDP), at 2.35 Å resolution. Each VrH&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-PPase subunit consists of an integral membrane domain formed by 16 transmembrane helices.&lt;ref name="Lin_2012"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lin SM, Tsai JY, Hsiao CD, Huang YT, Chiu CL, Liu MH, Tung JY, Liu TH, Pan RL, Sun YJ | title = Crystal structure of a membrane-embedded H+-translocating pyrophosphatase | journal = Nature | volume = 484 | issue = 7394 | pages = 399–403 | date = March 2012 | pmid = 22456709 | doi = 10.1038/nature10963 }}&lt;/ref&gt; IDP is bound in the cytosolic region of each subunit and trapped by numerous charged residues and five Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; ions. A previously undescribed proton translocation pathway is formed by six core transmembrane helices. Proton pumping can be initialized by PP(i) hydrolysis, and H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; is then transported into the vacuolar lumen through a pathway consisting of Arg 242, Asp 294, Lys 742 and Glu 301. Lin et al. (2012) proposed a working model of the mechanism for the coupling between proton pumping and PP(i) hydrolysis by H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-PPases. Membrane-integral pyrophosphatases (M-PPases) are crucial for the survival of plants, bacteria, and protozoan parasites. They couple pyrophosphate hydrolysis or synthesis to Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; or H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; pumping.&lt;ref name="Lin_2012" /&gt; The 2.6Å structure of ''[[Thermotoga maritima]]'' H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-PPase in the resting state revealed a previously unknown solution for ion pumping.&lt;ref name="Kellosalo_2012"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kellosalo J, Kajander T, Kogan K, Pokharel K, Goldman A | title = The structure and catalytic cycle of a sodium-pumping pyrophosphatase | journal = Science | volume = 337 | issue = 6093 | pages = 473–6 | date = July 2012 | pmid = 22837527 | doi = 10.1126/science.1222505 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The hydrolytic center, 20 angstroms above the membrane, is coupled to the gate formed by the conserved Asp(243), Glu(246), and Lys(707) by an unusual 'coupling funnel' of six α helices. Helix 12 slides down upon substrate binding to open the gate by a simple binding-change mechanism. Below the gate, four helices form the exit channel. Superimposing helices 3 to 6, 9 to 12, and 13 to 16 suggests that M-PPases arose through gene triplication.&lt;ref name="Kellosalo_2012" /&gt; By comparing the active sites, fluoride inhibition data and the various models for ion transport, Kajander et al. concluded that membrane-integral PPases probably use binding of pyrophosphate to drive pumping.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kajander T, Kellosalo J, Goldman A | title = Inorganic pyrophosphatases: one substrate, three mechanisms | journal = FEBS Letters | volume = 587 | issue = 13 | pages = 1863–9 | date = June 2013 | pmid = 23684653 | doi = 10.1016/j.febslet.2013.05.003 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Human Research Program logo.png|thumb|300px|Human Research Program Logo]]

The '''[http://www.nasa.gov/exploration/humanresearch/ Human Research Program (HRP)]''' was created in October 2005 at [[Johnson Space Center]] (JSC) in response to [[NASA|NASA's]] desire to move [[human]] [[research project]] management away from headquarters to JSC and to focus its research investment on investigating and mitigating the highest risks to [[astronaut]] [[health]] and performance in support of [[space exploration|exploration]] missions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Human Research Program|url=http://humanresearchroadmap.nasa.gov/intro/|accessdate=8 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The HRP is an applied research and technology program that investigates and mitigates risks to astronaut health and performance in support of exploration missions and provides countermeasures and technologies for human space exploration.

==Goals==
The goal of the HRP is to provide human health and performance countermeasures, knowledge, technologies and tools to enable safe, reliable and productive human [[space]] exploration.&lt;ref name=HRR&gt;{{cite web|title=Human Research Roadmap Architecture|url=http://humanresearchroadmap.nasa.gov/architecture/}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Human Research Program also aims to educate the public on the  challenges of [[human space flight]].  &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About Human Health and Safety|url=http://www.nasa.gov/exploration/humanresearch/|accessdate=8 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Human Research Roadmap==
The [http://humanresearchroadmap.nasa.gov/ Human Research Roadmap (HRR)] is a [[Internet|web-based tool]] that is used to communicate the content of the [http://humanresearchroadmap.nasa.gov/Documents/IRP_Rev_G_signed.pdf Integrated Research Plan (IRP)].  The IRP is utilized to identify the approach and research activities planned to address risks to human health and performance in space which are assigned to specific Elements within the program.&lt;ref name=HRR /&gt;

With this tool, users can search for items as gaps associated with a risk, the tasks associated with a given gap, the cross-integration of a task across multiple gaps or risks and deliverables associated with a gap or risk.&lt;ref name=HRR /&gt;

===Evidence===
Reviews of the accumulated evidence from medical records, space flight operations and research findings are compiled into [http://humanresearchroadmap.nasa.gov/evidence/ Evidence Reports].  This evidence provides the basis for identifying the highest priority human risks in space exploration, which comprise the risk portfolio within the HRP. It also provides the basis for identifying gaps and tasks in the research plan.&lt;ref name=HRR /&gt;

===Risks===
Risks include [[physiology|physiological]] effects of [[radiation]], low [[gravity]], [[terrestrial planet|terrestrial environments]] as well as unique challenges in medical support, human factors and behavioral health support.  Risks are identified in the [http://www.nasa.gov/pdf/559800main_HRP-47052.pdf Program Requirements Document (PRD)] and assigned to an Element within HRP to quantify, mitigate or monitor.&lt;ref name=HRR /&gt;

A current list of risks being evaluated can be found at the [[Portal:Human Health and Performance in Space|Human Health and Performance in Space]] portal as well as at the [http://humanresearchroadmap.nasa.gov/Risks/ HRR] website.

===Gaps===
For each risk, the HRP Element identifies [http://humanresearchroadmap.nasa.gov/Gaps/ gaps] in knowledge about the risk and the ability to mitigate the risk. The degree of uncertainty in understanding the likelihood, consequence and/or time-frame of a particular risk are the major factors that drive the gaps. Knowledge or mitigation gaps often appear in multiple risks, and many of the specific research tasks address multiple gaps.&lt;ref name=HRR /&gt;

===Tasks===
[http://humanresearchroadmap.nasa.gov/Tasks/ Tasks] partially or completely close a gap by better defining a risk or developing mitigation strategies to reduce the risk to an acceptable level. In some cases, a task can address multiple gaps across multiple risks.&lt;ref name=HRR /&gt;

===Deliverables===
Each task culminates in a deliverable or other agreed upon end-product such as recommended standards, flight rules,  processes, countermeasures and new technology.&lt;ref name=HRR /&gt;

==Elements==
There are currently seven elements in the HRP.&lt;ref name="Human Research"&gt;{{cite web|title=Human Research|url=http://www.nasa.gov/exploration/humanresearch/|accessdate=8 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Humane Slaughter Association''' (HSA) supports research, training, and development to improve the [[animal welfare|welfare]] of [[livestock]] during [[Transportation of animals|transport]] and [[animal slaughter|slaughter]]. It provides technical information about handling and slaughter on its website, training for farmer staff and vets, advice to governments and industry, and funding of science and technology to make slaughter more [[humane slaughter|humane]].&lt;ref name=OurWork&gt;{{cite web|title=Our Work|url=http://www.hsa.org.uk/our-work-introduction/our-work|website=Humane Slaughter Association|accessdate=1 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; HSA is the sister charity to [[Universities Federation for Animal Welfare]].&lt;ref name=UFAWSisterCharity&gt;{{cite web|title=International Development: UFAW – The International animal Welfare Science Society |url=http://www.ufaw.org.uk/internationaldevelopment.php |website=Universities Federation for Animal Welfare |accessdate=1 July 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150618185336/http://www.ufaw.org.uk/internationaldevelopment.php |archivedate=18 June 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

In 1911, the Council of Justice to Animals (CJA) was created to improve the slaughter of livestock and address the killing of unwanted pets. Novelist [[Thomas Hardy]] was a member. In 1928, CJA merged with the Humane Slaughter of Animals Association to become the Council of Justice for Animals and the Humane Slaughter Association, which is most often called "the HSA.".&lt;ref name=HSANewsletterMarch2011&gt;{{cite web|title=Humane Slaughter Association Newsletter March 2011|url=http://www.hsa.org.uk/downloads/annual-reports-and-newsletters/News%202011.pdf|website=Humane Slaughter Association|accessdate=1 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 1 April 2016 the Humane Slaughter Association became a charitable incorporated organization and the Council of Justice for Animals was dropped from the name.

[[File:Cattle Market- Everyday Life at Cattle Markets in Kent, England, UK, 1944 D22206.jpg|thumb|Sheep at Maidstone cattle market, Kent, England, UK, 1944]]

In the early 1920s, HSA introduced and demonstrated a mechanical stunner, which led to the adoption of humane [[stunning]] "by 28 London boroughs and later by 494 other local authorities." HSA helped improve water, shelter, and handling conditions at animal markets. It lobbied for transporting cattle by train instead of on foot, and in 1941, rail lines were built to a major slaughterhouse for this reason.&lt;ref name=History&gt;{{cite web|title=History of the HSA|url=http://www.hsa.org.uk/about/history-of-the-hsa|website=Humane Slaughter Association|accessdate=1 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

HSA played a key role in passage of
* UK's Slaughter of Animals Act 1933, requiring mechanical stunning of cows and [[electrical stunning]] of pigs&lt;ref name=History /&gt; (The law excluded pig facilities without electricity, sheep, and Jewish/Muslim meat.&lt;ref name=LeeseShechita&gt;{{cite web|last1=Leese|first1=Arnold|title=The Legalised Cruelty Of Shechita: The Jewish Method Of Cattle-Slaughter|url=http://www.jrbooksonline.com/HTML-docs/cattle-slaughter.htm|accessdate=1 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;)
* UK's Slaughter of Animals (Pigs) Act 1954, which required mechanical stunning of pigs outside slaughterhouses&lt;ref name=History /&gt;
* Canada's 1960 humane-slaughter regulations, partially inspired by HSA's captive-bolt demonstrations in 1950&lt;ref name=HSANewsletterMarch2011 /&gt;
* UK's ban on live exports for slaughter in the early 1970s (reversed in 1975).&lt;ref name=History /&gt;
HSA was asked for its views on the UK Slaughterhouses Act 1958 and the Prevention of Cruelty and Hygiene Regulations. HSA was mentioned in the House of Lords debates over UK's Slaughter of Poultry Act 1967.&lt;ref name=History /&gt;

==Research support==

===Humane Slaughter Award===

HSA aims to encourage research and development of more humane livestock-slaughter methods with its Humane Slaughter Award, which recognizes "individuals or organisations, based anywhere in the world, whose work has resulted in significant advances in the humane slaughter of farmed livestock."&lt;ref name=HumaneSlaughterAward&gt;{{cite web|title=Humane Slaughter Award|url=http://www.hsa.org.uk/grants--awards/humane-slaughter-award|website=Humane Slaughter Association|accessdate=1 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Scholarships===

HSA has given a total of 48 Dorothy Sidley Scholarships of £2,000 each "to enable students or trainees in the industry to carry out a project which is clearly aimed at improving the welfare of food animals in markets, during transport or at slaughter." Research supported has included the welfare of sheep while transported at sea, handling methods for poultry, rejection of carcases in religious slaughter, and captive-bolt stunning of alpacas.&lt;ref name=DorothySidleyScholarships&gt;{{cite web|title=Dorothy Sidley Scholarships|url=http://www.hsa.org.uk/grants--awards/dorothy-sidley-memorial-scholarships|website=Humane Slaughter Association|accessdate=1 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, HSA gave a Research Training Scholarship for PhD research to Jessica Hopkins of the [[Scottish Agricultural College]] for exploration of humane mechanical methods to kill sick or injured chickens in emergency situations on farms, as an improvement over [[cervical dislocation]], which is thought to not be completely humane.&lt;ref name=CentenaryScholarship&gt;{{cite web|title=HSA awards Centenary Scholarship to develop humane mechanical methods for killing chickens|url=http://www.hsa.org.uk/downloads/press/archive/2011-05-27%20Media%20release%20Centenary%20Scholarship.pdf|website=Humane Slaughter Association|accessdate=1 July 2014|date=27 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=VeterinaryRecordHopkins2011&gt;{{cite journal|title=HSA awards research training scholarship|journal=Veterinary Record|date=2011|volume=168|issue=23|doi=10.1136/vr.d3554}}&lt;!--|accessdate=1 July 2014--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=PoultryHopkins2011&gt;{{cite news|title=Scholarship for Humane Chicken Slaughter Methods|url=http://www.thepoultrysite.com/poultrynews/22733/scholarship-for-humane-chicken-slaughter-methods|accessdate=1 July 2014|agency=The Poultry Site|publisher=5M Publishing|date=27 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=MeatTradeHopkins2011&gt;{{cite news|title=UK - Killing chickens |url=http://www.meattradenewsdaily.co.uk/news/170611/uk___killing_chickens.aspx |agency=Meat Trade News Daily |accessdate=1 July 2014 |date=17 Jun 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111210054132/http://meattradenewsdaily.co.uk/news/170611/uk___killing_chickens.aspx |archivedate=10 December 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The research has been presented at several conferences.&lt;ref name=CentenaryResearchUpdate2013&gt;{{cite web|title=HSA Centenary Research Training Scholarship|url=http://www.hsa.org.uk/news-events/news/post/6-hsa-centenary-research-training-scholarship|website=Humane Slaughter Association|accessdate=1 July 2014|date=14 Sep 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Humanistic education''' (also called '''person-centered education''') is an approach to education based on the work of [[Humanistic psychology|humanistic psychologists]], most notably [[Abraham Maslow]] and [[Carl Rogers]].&lt;ref name="Clark 218"&gt;{{cite book|last=Power|first=F. Clark|title=Moral Education|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn=0313336474|pages=218}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hall|first=Eric|title=Human relations in education|year=1988|publisher=Psychology Press|isbn=041502532X|pages=14|author2=Carol Hall}}&lt;/ref&gt; Carl Rogers has been called{{by whom|date=February 2014}} the "Father of Humanistic Psychology" and devoted much of his efforts toward applying the results of his psychological research to person-centered teaching where empathy, caring about students, and genuineness on the part of the learning facilitator were found to be the key traits of the most effective teachers{{citation needed|date=February 2014}}. He edited a series of books dealing with humanistic education in his "Studies of the Person Series," which included his book, ''Freedom to Learn''&lt;ref&gt;Rogers, Carl R. ''Freedom to Learn''. Columbus, Ohio: Charles E. Merrill, 1969&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Learning to Feel - Feeling to Learn - Humanistic Education for the Whole Man,'' by Harold C. Lyon, Jr.&lt;ref&gt;Lyon, Harold C. Jr. ''Learning to Feel - Feeling to Learn''. Columbus, OH: Charles E. Merrill. 1971.&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1970s the term "humanistic education" became less popular after conservative groups equated it with "Secular Humanism" and attacked the writings of Harold Lyon as being anti-Christian. That began a successful effort by Aspy, Lyon, Rogers, and others to re-label it "person-centered teaching", replacing the term "humanistic education."  In a more general sense the term includes the work of other humanistic pedagogues, such as [[Rudolf Steiner]],&lt;ref&gt;"The Waldorf Schools offer an approach to humanistic education which has stood the test of time." Sarah W. Foster, "An Introduction to Waldorf Education", ''The Clearing House'', Vol. 57, No. 5 (Jan., 1984), pp. 228-230&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Timothy Leonard, ''Pedagogies of the Imagination: Mythopoetic Curriculum in Educational Practice'', Springer 2008, p. 232&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;R. C. S. Trahair, ''Utopias and Utopians: an historical dictionary'', Greenwood Press, 1999, p. 348&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Maria Montessori]]. All of these approaches seek to engage the "whole person"{{citation needed|date=February 2014}}: the intellect, feeling life{{clarify|date=February 2014}}, social capacities, and artistic and practical skills are all important focuses for growth and development. Important objectives include developing children's self-esteem, their ability to set and achieve appropriate goals, and their development toward full [[autonomy]].{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}

==History==
Humanistic education has its roots in [[Renaissance philosophy|Renaissance philosophers]] who emphasised the study of [[the humanities]]: grammar, rhetoric, history, poetry, and moral philosophy; these in turn built upon Classical models of education.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Oskar Kristeller, Renaissance Thought II: Papers on Humanism and the Arts (New York: Harper Torchbooks, 1965), p. 178.&lt;/ref&gt;

The growing Humanist-inspired emphasis on [[education in Scotland]] cumulated with the passing of the [[Education Act 1496]].

== Principles ==
{{Refimprove section|date=December 2012}}

=== Choice and control ===
The [[humanistic]] approach places a great deal of emphasis on students' choice and control over the course of their [[education]]. Students are encouraged to make choices that range from day-to-day activities to periodically setting future life goals. This allows for students to focus on a specific subject of interest for any amount of time they choose, within reason. Humanistic teachers believe it is important for students to be motivated and engaged in the material they are [[learning]], and this happens when the topic is something the students need and want to know.

=== Felt concerns ===
Humanistic [[education]] tends to focus on the felt concerns and interests of the students intertwining with the [[intellect]]. It is believed that the overall mood and feeling of the students can either hinder or foster the process of [[learning]].

=== The whole person ===
Humanistic [[educator]]s believe that both feelings and [[knowledge]] are important to the [[learning]] process. Unlike traditional educators, humanistic teachers do not separate the [[cognitive]] and affective domains. This aspect also relates to the curriculum in the sense that lessons and activities provide focus on various aspects of the student and not just rote memorization through note taking and lecturing.

=== Self evaluation ===
Humanistic [[educator]]s believe that grades are irrelevant and that only self-evaluation is meaningful. Grading encourages students to work for a grade and not for intrinsic satisfaction. Humanistic educators disagree with routine testing because they teach students rote memorization as opposed to meaningful [[learning]]. They also believe testing doesn't provide sufficient [[educational]] feedback to the teacher.

=== Teacher as a facilitator ===
"The tutor or lecturer tends to be more supportive than critical, more understanding than judgmental, more genuine than playing a role." &lt;ref&gt;Rowan, J. (n.d.). Humanistic education. Retrieved from {{cite web|url=http://www.ahpweb.org/rowan_bibliography/chapter17.html |accessdate=September 24, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111028171856/http://www.ahpweb.org/rowan_bibliography/chapter17.html |archivedate=October 28, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Their job is to foster an engaging environment for the students and ask inquiry-based questions that promote meaningful learning.

===Field studies on humanistic education===
David Aspy and Flora Roebuck performed the largest field study ever done{{citation needed|date=February 2014}}, in 42 states and 7 countries, in the 1970s and 80s, funded by the National Institute of Mental Health over a 12-year period, focusing on what led to achievement, [[creativity]], more student thinking and interactivity, less violence, and both teacher and student satisfaction. Their conclusions corroborated the earlier findings of Carl Rogers's that the more effective teachers were empathic, caring for or prizing their students, and were authentic or genuine in their classroom presence.&lt;ref&gt;Aspy, David, and Roebuck, Flora:  (1977) ''Kids Don't Learn from People They Don't Like'' Amherst, MA: Human Resources Development Press.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010 Jeffrey Cornelius-White and Adam Harbaugh published a large meta-analysis on Learner Centered Instruction including in their analysis all the higher quality studies on person-centered or humanistic education ever done since 1948.&lt;ref&gt;Cornelius-White, J. and Harbaugh, A: (2010) ''Learner Centered Instruction ''Los Angeles: Sage&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, Rogers, Lyon, and Tausch published ''On Becoming an Effective Teacher -- Person-centered Teaching, [[Psychology]], [[Philosophy]], and Dialogues with Carl R. Rogers and Harold Lyon'',&lt;ref&gt;Rogers, CR, Lyon, Harold C. Jr, and Tausch: (2013) ''On Becoming an Effective Teacher- On–Person-centered Teaching, [[Psychology]], [[Philosophy]], and Dialogues with Carl R. Rogers and HaroldLyon''.&amp;nbsp;London Routledge&lt;/ref&gt; which contained Rogers' last unpublished work on teaching and documented the research results of four highly related, independent studies which comprise the largest collection of data ever accumulated{{citation needed|date=February 2014}} to test a person-centered theory in the field of [[education]].

=== In environment ===
The [[Built environment|environment]] in a school which focuses their practice on humanistic [[education]] tends to have a very different setting than a traditional school. It consist of both indoor and outdoor environments with a majority of time being spent outdoors. The indoor setting may contain a few tables and chairs, bean bags for quiet reading and relaxation, book shelves, hide-aways, kitchens, lots of color and art posted on the walls. The outdoor environment is very engaging for students. You might find tree houses, outdoor kitchens, sand boxes, play sets, natural materials, sporting activities etc. The wide range of activities are offered for students allowing for free choices of interest.

==Related movements==
A number of contemporary school movements incorporate humanistic perspectives within a larger, holistic context: these include the [[Waldorf education|Waldorf]], [[Montessori education|Montessori]], [[Reggio Emilia]], and [[Neohumanism|Neohumanist]] schools. These originated independently of the humanistic psychology movement and at least some of them incorporate spiritual perspectives absent from the traditional humanistic approach.&lt;ref&gt;Lucila Telles Rudge, [http://etd.ohiolink.edu/view.cgi/Rudge%20Lucila%20T.pdf?osu1213289333 "Holistic Education: An Analysis of its Pedagogical Application"], dissertation, Ohio State University&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Internal fertilization''' is the union of an [[egg cell]] with a [[sperm]] during [[sexual reproduction]] inside the body of a parent. For this to happen there needs to be a method for the male to introduce the sperm into the female's reproductive tract. In [[mammal]]s, [[reptile]]s, some [[bird]]s, some [[fish]] and certain other groups of animals, this is done by [[copulation]], the [[penis]] or other [[intromittent organ]] being introduced into the [[vagina]] or [[cloaca]].&lt;ref name="Hyman1992"&gt;{{cite book|author=Libbie Henrietta Hyman|title=Hyman's Comparative Vertebrate Anatomy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VKlWjdOkiMwC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q=fertilization&amp;f=false|date=15 September 1992|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=978-0-226-87013-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Austin"/&gt; In most birds, the [[cloacal kiss]] is used, the two animals pressing their cloacas together while transferring sperm.&lt;ref name=VB /&gt; [[Salamander]]s, [[spider]]s, some [[insect]]s and some [[mollusc]]s undertake internal fertilization by transferring a [[spermatophore]], a bundle of sperm, from the male to the female.

==Expulsion==
{{main|Modes of reproduction}}

At some point, the growing [[egg (biology)|egg]] or [[offspring]] must be expelled. There are several possible [[modes of reproduction]]. These are traditionally classified as follows:

* [[Oviparity]], as in most [[insect]]s and reptiles, [[monotreme]]s, dinosaurs and all birds which lay eggs that continue to develop after being laid, and hatch later.&lt;ref&gt;[[Thierry Lodé]] (2001). ''Les stratégies de reproduction des animaux'' (Reproduction Strategies in Animal Kingdom). Eds. Dunod Sciences. Paris.&lt;/ref&gt; 
* [[Viviparity]], as in almost all mammals (such as [[whale]]s, [[kangaroo]]s and [[human]]s) which bear their young live. The developing young spend proportionately more time within the female's reproductive tract.  The young are later released to survive on their own, with varying amounts of help from the [[parent]] (s) of the [[species]].&lt;ref&gt;Blackburn, D. G. (2000).

* [[Ovoviviparity]], as in the [[garter snake]], most [[Viperidae|vipers]], and the [[Madagascar hissing cockroach]], which have eggs (with [[Eggshell|shells]]) that hatch as they are laid, making it resemble live birth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Biology of Sharks and Their Relatives |editor1=Carrier, J.C. |editor2=Musick, J.A. |editor3=Heithaus, M.R. |year=2012 |publisher=CRC Press |isbn=1439839247 |pages=296–301}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Into Thin Air: Death on Everest''''' is a 1997 American [[Disaster film|disaster]] [[television film]] based on [[Jon Krakauer]]'s memoir ''[[Into Thin Air]]'' (1997). The film, directed by [[Robert Markowitz]] and written by [[Robert J. Avrech]], tells the story of the [[1996 Mount Everest disaster]]. It was broadcast on the [[American Broadcasting Company]] on November 9, 1997.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Into Thin Air: Death on Everest|date=November 9, 1997|url=https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/178032/Into-Thin-Air-Death-on-Everest/overview}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
The film portrays the [[1996 Mount Everest disaster]] and the events that preceded it. The film mainly follows [[Jon Krakauer]], the author of the book on which the film is based (''[[Into Thin Air]]: A Personal Account of the Mt. Everest Disaster'' (1997)); it also follows the climbing teams of summit guides [[Rob Hall]] and [[Scott Fischer]].

The film begins with Krakauer giving a monologue about the events about the disaster. The guides, Rob Hall (Nat Parker), and Scott Fischer (Peter Horton) introduce themselves, their teams, and discuss with the clients how they intend to reach the summit by the set date. Hall's group contains Doug Hansen, a mailman from Seattle, Krakauer, Yasuko Namba, and several others. Fischer's group contains a New York socialite, Sandy Pittman, who will perform what Krakauer does for Hall's group, reporting and bring attention. At base camp, Hall speaks with his pregnant wife Jan, in New Zealand, about potential names for their daughter. The groups slowly make their way through camps 2, 3, and 4, and then begin their ascent for the summit. However, in camp 2, Fischer is forced to go all the way back down, so he can take a sick client, Dale Cruz, down for help. Scott refuses help, and returns exhausted and out of breath.

The ascent begins well, with both groups making steady pace. However, upon reaching the bottom of the Hillary step, they realize that there are no fixed ropes. The Sherpa there states it's a two-person job, and the other Sherpa never arrived, mostly due to being too tired and sick from dragging Pittman and all of her heavy equipment all the way up. Mountain Madness guides Anatoli Boukreev and Neil Beidelman set the fixed ropes, but by then dozens of climbers had already reached the step, and now a large jam is at the bottom. Krakauer continues up, and reaches the summit with Anatoli Boukreev, where shortly afterward they are joined by Adventure Consultants guide Andy Harris. Krakauer begins his descent, but reaches the step only the find the jam has only gotten worse, and is forced to wait it out. Meanwhile, Hall is forced to tell client Doug Hansen that they have to turn around and go back. Hansen refuses, as he failed to reach the summit the year before, and he knows he won't be able to afford a third attempt. Hall and Hansen argue before Hall finally caves in and they continue, missing Hall's 2:00 PM turnaround time. Finally, the path down the step clears and Harris begins to descend; Krakauer meanwhile begins to hallucinate from a lack of oxygen. Earlier he had asked Harris to decrease his oxygen flow, but Harris instead increased it, and Krakauer nearly falls over the side, but manages to catch himself. He makes his way down the step and to Harris, and realizes something is wrong with Harris, who thinks the completely full bottles at the oxygen drop are empty. As he descends, he runs into Hansen and Hall, and points out to Hansen that storm clouds are making their way up through the valley and up the mountain.

Shortly after 3 PM, the majority of Hall's and Fischer's groups finally reach the summit. As Krakauer continues his descent, he runs into Scott Fischer, who is completely exhausted and refuses to turn around. Shortly after 4 PM, Rob Hall and Doug Hansen finally reach the summit, where Hall remarks to Hansen that a storm is coming. As he continues to go down, and the weather starts to get bad, Krakauer runs into Beck Weathers, sitting alone by himself in snow. Weathers had eye surgery performed prior to the trip, and has lost vision in his eyes during the summit ascent. He declines to leave with Krakauer, explaining he had promised Rob Hall that he would wait for him to go down. At 4:30, Fischer and his Sherpa, Lopsang, finally reach the summit where Scott feels ill and collapses. Around 5, Krakauer finally reaches the tents at camp 4, where he goes to sleep. The weather continues to worsen, and later, Beidelman, Mike Groom, and the majority of both teams' clients stop to rest, where they run into Beck Weathers, who agrees to descend with them. Storm clouds and thick snowfall cause the guides to lose their positions and not know where they need to go. Higher on the mountain,  Hall and Hansen watch as Scott Fischer is dragged by them, so weak he can no longer stand.

Night falls, and Krakauer is awoken in his tent by Rob's Sherpa, Angdorjee, who informs him that the storm is getting increasingly worse, and that Rob and majority of the clients have yet to return. The pair make an attempt to find them, but quickly turn back when they realize the conditions are too treacherous. Meanwhile, Rob attempts to convince Doug to stand up and continue descending, but Doug begs Rob to leave him, telling Rob he will die if he attempts to save him. Rob refuses to leave him behind, and they continue. Scott, suffering from edema, walks off the side of the mountain, and is only saved when his Sherpa pulls him back up with their connected short rope. Scott then begins to fall into unconsciousness, and Lopsang radios for help. Rob continues to struggle down with Doug. In the darkness, Rob slips and falls down, and becomes separated from a hallucinating Doug. He then watches helplessly as Doug, too far away to help, tumbles over the side to his death. Rob is then found by Andy, who attempts to help him up. Andy then leaves, telling Rob he is going to get help. Despite Rob's plea's, Andy continues to go. Andy disappears from view. Rob then hears him cry out, and crawls forward to find Andy's hat lying next to a large drop off, and assumes that Andy has fallen to his death. Rob, buried under snow, communicates with Krakauer attempting to get direction on where he can find oxygen. He gets direction, but then falls down again, and begins to moan. The oxygen bottles are then revealed to be less than twenty feet away from him, but he doesn't see them. Beidelman and Groom's group becomes hopelessly lost, and they take only the clients who can walk with them, dropping Yasuko, Beck, Sandy Pittman, and Charlotte Fox. Scott continues to drift in and out of consciousness, only muttering the words "I am invincible" to his Sherpa, before again losing consciousness. Anatoli Boukreev appears, and helps down Charlotte Fox and Pittman, but is unable to get a third client. Rob begins to hallucinate about seeing his wife Jan, but then snaps outs of it, to realize he is still stuck. He also begins to realize that his hands and his legs are getting extremely frostbitten, and he is having trouble moving. He then blacks out again.

Rob then awakens the next morning, to realize that he is still alive, but barely. He radios the camp, who put him onto the radio with his wife Jan. He asks her if Sarah would be an appropriate name for their daughter, and she agrees. They both tell each other they love them, and then Rob says goodbye to his wife. He dies shortly afterward from hypothermia. Beck Weathers then wakes up, somehow having survived being buried under the snow with no oxygen. Still blinded, he stumbles back to camp, where he receives help. Meanwhile, Anatoli climbs up, and finds the now frozen corpse of Scott Fischer. He says goodbye, and after pulling Fischer's backpack over his face, he leaves. Back at base camp the survivors reminisce about the friends that they have lost.

'''Karl Struss''', A.S.C. (November 30, 1886 – December 15, 1981) was an American [[photographer]] and a [[cinematographer]] of the 1900s through the 1950s. He was also one of the earliest pioneers of [[3-D film]]s. While he mostly worked on [[films]], such as [[F. W. Murnau]]'s ''[[Sunrise: A Song of Two Humans]]'' and [[Charlie Chaplin]]'s ''[[The Great Dictator]]'' and ''[[Limelight (1952 film)|Limelight]]'', he was also one of the cinematographers for the [[television series]] ''[[Broken Arrow (TV series)|Broken Arrow]]'' and photographed 19 episodes of ''[[My Friend Flicka]]''.

==Life and career==
Karl Struss was born in [[New York, New York]], in 1886. After an illness in high school, Karl's father, Henry, removed his son from school and placed him as a labor operator at Seybel &amp; Struss bonnet wire factory.&lt;ref name="NYtoHollywood"&gt;{{Cite book |title=New York to Hollywood, The Photography of Karl Struss |last=McCandless |first=Barbara |last2=Yochelson |first2=Bonnie |last3=Koszarski |first3=Richard |work="A Commitment to Beauty"  |publisher=Amon Carter Museum |year=1995 |isbn=0-8263-1637-9 |publication-place=Fort Worth, TX |publication-date=1995 |pages=14, 17}}&lt;/ref&gt; He began to develop an interest in photography, experimenting with an 8 x 10 camera, and, beginning in 1908, attended [[Clarence H. White]]'s evening art photography course at Teachers College, [[Columbia University]], concluding his studies in 1912&lt;ref&gt;''New York to Hollywood'' 1995, pp. 19, 92.&lt;/ref&gt; Early in his studies, he explored the properties of camera lenses and eventually invented, in 1909, what he attempted to patent as the Struss Pictorial Lens, a soft-focus lens&lt;ref&gt;''New York to Hollywood'' 1995, pp. 20-21.&lt;/ref&gt; This lens was considered popular with pictorial photographers of the time. The Struss Pictorial lens was the first soft-focus lens introduced into the motion picture industry in 1916.&lt;ref name="ANB" /&gt;

Initially, Struss gained attention in the photo world when twelve of his pictorial works were chosen by [[Alfred Stieglitz]] for the Albright Art Gallery International Exhibition of Pictorial Photography in 1910. This was the final exhibition of the [[Photo-Secession]], an organization that promoted photography as fine art.&lt;ref name="ANB" /&gt; Struss' reputation was solidified by his inclusion in the exhibition "What the Camera Does in the Hand of the Artist" at the Newark Art Museum, held in April 1911, and an invitation by the Teacher's College for Struss to organize a one-person exhibition of his views of New York as well as to teach White's course in the summer of 1912 while White was away.&lt;ref&gt;''New York to Hollywood'' 1995, pp. 24-25.&lt;/ref&gt; Struss was invited by Stieglitz to join the [[Photo-Secession]] in 1912, which led to the publication of Struss' photographs in the group's magazine ''Camera Work''. In 1913 Struss, in collaboration with Edward Dickson, [[Clarence White]], [[Alvin Langdon Coburn]], and [[Paul Lewis Anderson|Paul Anderson]], began their own publication, ''Platinum Print''. In 1914, he resigned his position at the family business and asserted his identity as a professional photographer by assuming Clarence White's former studio space in June of that year &lt;ref&gt;''New York to Hollywood'' 1995, p. 30.&lt;/ref&gt;

At the suggestion of Coburn, Struss submitted prints to the American Invitational Section of the annual exhibition of the [[Royal Photographic Society]] in London, initiating an exhibiting practice he would continue into the 1920s.&lt;ref&gt;''New York to Hollywood'' 1995, p. 33.&lt;/ref&gt; He also participated in numerous exhibitions organized by photography clubs and other associations, including the Pittsburgh Salon of National Photographic Art and the annual photography display organized by the Philadelphia department store [[Wanamaker's]].&lt;ref&gt;''New York to Hollywood'' 1995, pp. 226-228. See the appendix (pp. 225-235) for Struss' Lifetime Exhibition Record&lt;/ref&gt; As Struss continued his exhibitions and specialized commissions, he produced commercial photography for magazines including ''[[Vogue (magazine)|Vogue]]'', ''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'', and ''[[Harper's Bazaar]]''.&lt;ref name="ANB"&gt;{{cite book | title=Struss, Karl Fischer | publisher=American National Biography | author=McCandless, Barbara | year=1999 | location=Cary, North Carolina | pages=57–59}}&lt;/ref&gt; (However, he was quick to insist that he was not doing [[fashion photography|''fashion'' photography]].) His photographic practice was interrupted by [[World War I]]. In 1917, he registered for the draft and then enlisted with the aim of fulfilling his military service through photography.&lt;ref&gt;''New York to Hollywood'' 1995, pp. 34-35.&lt;/ref&gt; He trained to teach aerial photography but an investigation into Struss's German affiliations launched by the Military Intelligence Department led to his demotion from the rank of Sergeant to private and, after a limbo period in confinement in [[Ithaca, New York]], where he had originally gone to teach in the new School of Military Aeronautics, a transfer to [[United States Disciplinary Barracks|Fort Leavenworth]] to serve as a prison guard and then as a file clerk.&lt;ref&gt;''New York to Hollywood'' 1995, pp. 35-41.&lt;/ref&gt; In the latter role, he took up photography again, documenting the prisoners. Near the close of the war, in an attempt to clear his record of rumors of anti-Americanism, he applied and was accepted into Officer's Training Camp at the rank of corporal.&lt;ref&gt;''New York to Hollywood'' 1995, p. 42.&lt;/ref&gt; While Struss was eventually honorably discharged, it is likely that the failure of his business in New York in his absence and the fracturing of many of his professional relationships in the wake of the military investigation led him to be disinclined to resume his former roles in New York.&lt;ref&gt;''New York to Hollywood'' 1995, p. 43.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1919, after his discharge, he moved to [[Los Angeles]] and signed on with [[Cecil B. DeMille]] as a cameraman, initially for the film ''[[For Better, for Worse (1919 film)|For Better, For Worse]]'' starring [[Gloria Swanson]], followed by another Swanson film ''[[Male and Female]]'' and leading to a two-year contract with the studio&lt;ref&gt;''New York to Hollywood'' 1995, p. 48.&lt;/ref&gt; In early 1921, he married Ethel Wall, who helped to support him in his photographic work independent of the film studios, which included pictorial views set in California&lt;ref&gt;''New York to Hollywood'' 1995, p. 50.&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1920s, Struss worked on such films as ''[[Ben-Hur (1925 film)|Ben-Hur]]'' and F. W. Murnau's ''Sunrise: A Song of Two Humans''. In 1927, he contracted with [[United Artists]], where he worked with [[D. W. Griffith]] on such films as ''[[Drums of Love]]'' and also filmed [[Mary Pickford]]'s first talking film ''[[Coquette (film)|Coquette]]''&lt;ref&gt;''New York to Hollywood'' 1995, pp. 179-180.&lt;/ref&gt; He continued his experimental work with camera technology, developing the "Lupe Light" and a new bracket system for the Bell &amp; Howell camera &lt;ref&gt;''New York to Hollywood'' 1995, p. 181.&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1931 through 1945, Struss worked as a cameraman for Paramount, where he worked on a variety of material including films featuring Mae West, Bing Crosby, and Dorothy Lamour&lt;ref&gt;''New York to Hollywood'' 1995, p. 182-183.&lt;/ref&gt; Struss also aimed to shape the field through publishing; for example, in 1934 he authored "Photographic Modernism and the Cinematographer" for ''American Cinematographer''. Struss was later admitted to the [[American Society of Cinematographers]], and was a founding member of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | title=Karl Struss | encyclopedia=MacMillan Biographical Encyclopedia of Photographic Artists and Innovators. | publisher=MacMillan Publishing Co. | last1=Brown |first1=Turner |last2=Partnow |first2=Elaine | year=1983 |isbn=978-0-02-517500-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1949, while working as a freelancer, he began his work in "stereo cinematography", becoming one of the first proponents of that art form. Unfortunately, he did most of his [[3D film]] work in [[Italy]] and none of his films were subsequently released in 3D in the [[United States]].

Struss's photographic archive of exhibition prints, film stills, negatives and papers (3 linear feet of materials) is available at the [[Amon Carter Museum of American Art]] located in [[Fort Worth]], Texas.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cartermuseum.org/library/archives Amon Carter Museum Library &amp; Archives]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Awards==
In his career, Struss was nominated for an [[Academy Award for Best Cinematography]] four times. The first time, and the only time he won, was for [[F. W. Murnau]]'s ''[[Sunrise: A Song of Two Humans]]'' in 1929, sharing that award with [[Charles Rosher]]. He was nominated again in 1932 for ''[[Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde (1931 film)|Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde]]'', in 1934 for ''[[The Sign of the Cross (1932 film)|The Sign of the Cross]]'', and in 1942 for ''[[Aloma of the South Seas (1941 film)|Aloma of the South Seas]]'' with [[Wilfred M. Cline]], A.S.C. and [[William E. Snyder (cinematographer)|William E. Snyder]], A.S.C.

{{Nihongo|'''King Ghidorah'''|キングギドラ|Kingu Gidora}} is a [[kaiju|film monster]] originating from [[Toho]]'s  ''[[Ghidorah, the Three-Headed Monster]]'' (1964). Although Toho officially trademarks the character as '''King Ghidorah''',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://img2.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20131211004826/godzilla/images/b/b3/Monster_Icons_-_King_Ghidorah.png|title=King Ghidorah Official Trademark|publisher=Toho|accessdate=September 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; the character was originally referred to as '''Ghidrah''' in some English markets.{{sfn|Ryfle|1998|p=117}}

Although King Ghidorah's design has remained largely consistent throughout its appearances (an armless, bipedal, golden-scaled bat-winged dragon with three heads and two tails), its origin story has varied from being an [[Extraterrestrial life|extraterrestrial]] planet-killing dragon,&lt;ref name="GTHM"/&gt;&lt;ref name="RoMIII"/&gt; a [[Genetic engineering|genetically engineered]] monster from the future,&lt;ref name="GvKG"/&gt; or a guardian monster of ancient Japan.&lt;ref name="GMK"/&gt; The character is usually portrayed as an [[archenemy]] of [[Godzilla]] and [[Mothra]],&lt;ref name="GTHM"/&gt;&lt;ref name="RoMIII"&gt;''[[Rebirth of Mothra III]]'' (1998). Directed by Okihiro Yoneda. [[Toho]]&lt;/ref&gt; though it has had one appearance as an ally of the latter.&lt;ref name="GMK"/&gt;

Despite rumors that Ghidorah was meant to represent the threat posed by [[China]], which had at the time of the character's creation just developed [[nuclear weapon]]s,&lt;ref&gt;Jess-Cooke, C. (2009), ''Film Sequels: Theory and Practice from Hollywood to Bollywood'', Edinburgh University Press, p. 38, {{ISBN|0748689478}}&lt;/ref&gt; director [[Ishirō Honda]] denied the connection and stated that Ghidorah was simply a modern take on the dragon [[Yamata no Orochi]].&lt;ref&gt;David Milner, [http://www.davmil.org/www.kaijuconversations.com/honda.htm "Ishiro Honda Interview"], ''Kaiju Conversations'' (December 1992)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
===Development===
The initial idea for ''[[Ghidorah, the Three-Headed Monster]]'' came from [[Tomoyuki Tanaka]], who also created Godzilla. Tanaka's inspiration came from an illustration of the [[Lernaean Hydra]] in a book about Greek Mythology, and [[Yamata no Orochi|Orochi]] of Japanese folklore. Tanaka was enamored with the idea of Godzilla fighting a multi-headed serpent, but considered seven or eight heads to be too excessive, and thus the number of heads was reduced to three.&lt;ref name="cho"&gt;{{cite web|author=CHO Japan |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLGd5Nnl_Uw&amp;list=UUU03keCaesfRWZPYV1FUxXw |title=1970's Godzilla FX Director - PART I - ７０年代のゴジラの特技監督 (SciFi Japan TV #06) |publisher=YouTube |date=2012-10-31 |accessdate=2015-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; The final version was an armless three-headed [[dragon]] with large wings, two tails and of extraterrestrial origin.&lt;ref name="dvdcommentary"/&gt;

===Shōwa era (1964-1973)===
[[File:Showa King Ghidorah 1965.png|thumb|Shōwa King Ghidorah]]
In its debut film, ''[[Ghidorah, the Three-Headed Monster]]'', Ghidorah is portrayed as an ancient extraterrestrial entity responsible for the destruction of the [[Venusians|Venusian]] civilization, five thousand years before the film's events. Its attempt to destroy Earth is thwarted by the combined efforts of [[Godzilla]], [[Rodan]] and [[Mothra]].&lt;ref name="GTHM"&gt;''[[Ghidorah, the Three-Headed Monster]]'' (1964). Directed by [[Ishirō Honda]]. [[Toho]].&lt;/ref&gt; 

Subsequent Shōwa era films would portray Ghidorah as the pawn of various alien races seeking to subjugate Earth.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Invasion of Astro-Monster]]'' (1965). Directed by [[Ishirō Honda]]. [[Toho]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[[Destroy All Monsters]]'' (1968). Directed by [[Ishirō Honda]]. [[Toho]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[[Godzilla vs. Gigan]]'' (1972). Directed by [[Jun Fukuda]]. [[Toho]].&lt;/ref&gt; King Ghidorah also appears in the fifth and sixth episodes of the television series ''[[Zone Fighter]]'', where it is revealed that it is a creation of the Garoga aliens.&lt;ref&gt;"Attack King Ghidorah!". ''[[Zone Fighter]]''. Directed by [[Jun Fukuda]]. April 30, 1973&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"King Ghidorah's Counterattack!". ''[[Zone Fighter]]''. Directed by [[Jun Fukuda]]. May 7, 1973&lt;/ref&gt;

Screenwriter [[Shinichi Sekizawa]] insisted that the Ghidorah suit be fabricated using light-weight silicon-based materials in order to grant the wearer greater mobility.{{sfn|Kalat|2010|p=77}}{{sfn|Kalat|2010|p=78}} The final Ghidorah design was constructed by special effects artist Teizo Toshimitsu,&lt;ref name="inoue"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scifijapan.com/articles/2012/02/24/yasuyuki-inoue-1923-2012/|title=Yasuyuki Inoue: 1922-2012|work=SciFi Japan|date=|accessdate=April 26, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; who had initially painted it green in order to further differentiate it from [[Godzilla]], [[Rodan]] and [[Mothra]], but changed it to gold on the insistence of [[Eiji Tsuburaya]], after his assistant noted that being a creature from [[Venus]], the "gold planet", Ghidorah should be that color.&lt;ref name="cho"/&gt; 

The monster suit itself was built by Akira Watanabe, and worn by [[Shoichi Hirose]],{{sfn|Ryfle|1998|p=116}} who also played King Kong in Toho's ''[[King Kong vs. Godzilla]]''.{{sfn|Ryfle|1998|p=84}} Hirose walked hunched over inside the Ghidorah costume, holding a metal bar for balance, while puppeteers would control its heads, tails and wings off-camera like a marionette.&lt;ref name="dvdcommentary"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oYfzXLDv-94|title=Audio Commentary by David Kalat|work=Ghidorah, the Three-Headed Monster - Classic Media 2007 DVD Release|date=|accessdate=April 26, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The monster's heads were each fitted with remotely controlled motors, which were connected to operators via a wire extending from the suit's backside.&lt;ref name="inoue"/&gt;

Performing as Ghidorah proved challenging to Hirose, as he had to time his movements in a way that would not conflict with the separately operated heads and wings, as doing so would have resulted in the overhead wires tangling.{{sfn|Kalat|2010|p=77}}{{sfn|Kalat|2010|p=78}} Because of the suit's weight, it frequently snapped the overhead wires supporting it.&lt;ref name="inoue"/&gt; Special effects were added as the creature is capable emitting destructive, lightning-like "gravity beams" from its mouths and generating hurricane-force winds from its wings.&lt;ref&gt;King Ghidorah character profile - Godzilla Movie Studio Tour (PC Game), 1998&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite King Ghidorah's central role in the film's plot, the character was given little screen time, as Hirose had fallen out with special effects director [[Eiji Tsuburaya]], who never forgave Hirose for accepting a Hollywood deal, and subsequently he hired Susumu Utsumi to play King Ghidorah after ''[[Invasion of Astro-Monster]]''.{{sfn|Kalat|2010|p=77}}{{sfn|Kalat|2010|p=78}} In that film, King Ghidorah was given a darker shade of gold, and its movements both on land and in the air were more fluid than during ''Ghidorah the Three-Headed Monster'', as the special effects crew had at that point learned from the shortcomings of the previous film's depiction of the creature.{{sfn|Ryfle|1998|p=124}}

===Heisei era (1991-1998)===
[[File:Heisei_Ghidorah_1991.png|thumb|right|Heisei King Ghidorah.]]
In ''[[Godzilla vs. King Ghidorah]]'' (1991), the creature's backstory is completely re-envisioned: it originates as a trio of diminutive genetically engineered creatures called "Dorats" owned by members of the 23rd century Equal Environment Earth Union, a group dedicated to [[Balance of power (international relations)|equalizing the power]] of Earth's nations. Seeking to stop Japan's global economic dominance in their timeline by transforming the Dorats into King Ghidorah through nuclear exposure, the Earth Unionists hope to plant the Dorats on Lagos Island during the [[Castle Bravo|1954 H-bomb tests]] there. Prior to doing so, they remove the dinosaur that would ultimately become [[Godzilla]] from the island, so that the resulting King Ghidorah would be able to attack Japan without opposition. In 1992, the Earth Unionists unleash Ghidorah onto Japan, but he is defeated by a recreated Godzilla. The wounded King Ghidorah lies dormant under the sea for two centuries before being outfitted with robotic parts by a disillusioned Earth Unionist and sent back to 1992 as Mecha-King Ghidorah in order to stop Godzilla's rampage.&lt;ref name="GvKG"&gt;''[[Godzilla vs. King Ghidorah]]'' (1991). Directed by [[Kazuki Ōmori]]. [[Toho]]&lt;/ref&gt; 

The character's ruffs of hairs surrounding its heads were replaced with horns, as it proved difficult for the special effects team to superimpose the individual strands of hair onto footage of people escaping the monster.&lt;ref name="nishikawa"&gt;David Milner, [http://www.davmil.org/www.kaijuconversations.com/nishikaw.htm "Shinji Nishikawa Interview"], ''Kaiju Conversations'' (December 1995)&lt;/ref&gt; Special effects director [[Koichi Kawakita]] had originally planned on having each of Ghidorah's heads fire differently colored beams, but this was ultimately scrapped in favor of the classic yellow color.&lt;ref name="kawakita"&gt;David Milner, [http://www.davmil.org/www.kaijuconversations.com/kawakit.htm "Koichi Kawakita Interview"], ''Kaiju Conversations'' (December 1994)&lt;/ref&gt; This version of King Ghidorah was portrayed by [[Hurricane Ryu]].{{sfn|Ryfle|1998|p=364}}

In ''[[Godzilla vs. Mechagodzilla II]]'' (1993), Mecha-King Ghidorah's robotic middle head is salvaged by the United Nations Godzilla Countermeasures Center (UNGCC) and [[Reverse engineering|reverse engineered]] to create [[Mechagodzilla]].&lt;ref name="GvMGII"&gt;''[[Godzilla vs. Mechagodzilla II]]'' (1993). Directed by [[Takao Okawara]]. [[Toho]]&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[Rebirth of Mothra III]]'' (1998), King Ghidorah is depicted as an extraterrestrial that landed on earth during the [[Cretaceous Period]] of the [[Mesozoic Era]] and [[Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event|wiped out]] the [[dinosaur]]s by draining them of their life energies. Ghidorah left Earth and returns in modern times to feed on humans. [[Mothra]] fails to defeat the monster and travels back to the Cretaceous in order to kill Ghidorah retroactively. Mothra defeats the younger Ghidorah, but the monster's severed tail allows it to regenerate back into its adult form in modern times. Mothra finally kills the monster by transforming into a new form: "Armor Mothra".&lt;ref name="RoMIII"/&gt; This version of King Ghidorah was portrayed by [[Tsutomu Kitagawa]].{{sfn|Solomon|2017|p=102}}

===Millennium era (2001)===
[[File:Millennium_King_Ghidorah_2001.png|thumb|right|Millennium King Ghidorah.]]
In ''[[Godzilla, Mothra and King Ghidorah: Giant Monsters All-Out Attack]]'', Ghidorah is portrayed as having been one of the three Guardians of Yamato, originating 1,000 years before the events of the film. Initially an antagonist, Ghidorah was imprisoned in [[Mount Fuji]], only to be reawakened in 2001 to halt Godzilla's destruction of Tokyo. Ghidorah is defeated, but then revived and empowered by ally [[Mothra]].&lt;ref name="GMK"&gt;''[[Godzilla, Mothra and King Ghidorah: Giant Monsters All-Out Attack]]'' (2001). Directed by [[Shusuke Kaneko]]. [[Toho]].&lt;/ref&gt; 

Director [[Shūsuke Kaneko]] had originally planned on using [[Varan]] as Godzilla's principal antagonist, but was pressured by Toho chairman [[Isao Matsuoka]] to use the more recognizable and profitable King Ghidorah,&lt;ref name="kaneko"&gt;Ed Godziszewski and Norman England, "Interview with Shusuke Kaneko", ''Japanese Giants'' #9 (June 2002)&lt;/ref&gt; as the previous film in the franchise, ''[[Godzilla vs. Megaguirus]]'', which featured an original and unfamiliar antagonist, was a box office and critical failure. In order to emphasize Ghidorah's heroic role in the movie, the creature's size was greatly reduced, and was portrayed by [[Akira Ohashi]], who moved the creature's heads as hand puppets.{{sfn|Kalat|2010|p=240}}{{sfn|Kalat|2010|p=241}}

===Anime trilogy (2017-2018)===

===MonsterVerse era (2019-)===
[[File:MonsterVerse_King_Ghidorah_2019.png|thumb|right|MonsterVerse King Ghidorah.]]
In 2014, [[Legendary Pictures]] announced their acquisition of the licenses to King Ghidorah, [[Mothra]], and [[Rodan]] from [[Toho]] to use in their [[MonsterVerse]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Jeffries |first=Adrianne |url=https://www.theverge.com/2014/7/26/5940259/godzilla-2-confirmed-with-director-gareth-edwards |title=Gareth Edwards returns to direct 'Godzilla 2' with Rodan and Mothra |publisher=The Verge |date=July 26, 2014 |accessdate=August 15, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The trio were introduced in ''[[Kong: Skull Island]]'' in a [[post-credits scene]] depicting cave paintings of all three monsters, including Godzilla.&lt;ref name="KSI Cameo"/&gt;

In June 2017, a press release confirmed that Rodan, Mothra, and King Ghidorah will be featured in ''[[Godzilla: King of the Monsters (2019 film)|Godzilla: King of the Monsters]]''.&lt;ref name="pr"&gt;{{cite press release|url=https://www.warnerbros.com/studio/news/warner-bros-pictures-and-legendary-pictures-monsterverse-kicks-gear-next-godzilla|title=Warner Bros.

Other actors will perform the body.&lt;ref name="Jason"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thewrap.com/rampage-breakout-star-jason-liles-cast-as-godzillas-archenemy-in-godzilla-king-of-monsters-exclusive/|title=‘Rampage’ Breakout Star Jason Liles Joins ‘Godzilla: King of Monsters’ (Exclusive)|last=Verhoeven|first=Beatrice|work=The Wrap|date=April 26, 2018|accessdate=April 26, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Additional KG performers"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.empireonline.com/movies/rampage-2/rampage-jason-liles-playing-king-ghidorah-godzilla-king-monsters/|title=Rampage's Jason Liles Playing King Ghidorah In Godzilla: King Of Monsters|last=White|first=James|work=Empire|date=April 26, 2018|accessdate=April 28, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; This version of Ghidorah stands 521 ft (158.8 m) tall and is referred to as "Monster Zero" by Monarch. According to Monarch's database, ancient civilizations called the monster "Ghidorah".&lt;ref name="Monarch Files"/&gt;

===Abilities===
Throughout the creature's appearances, the only consistent abilities are [[flight]] and the capacity to fire "gravity beams" from its mouths. In ''[[Ghidorah, the Three-Headed Monster]]'', the first incarnation is shown travelling through space within a [[meteor]] capable of generating magnetic fields.&lt;ref name="GTHM"/&gt; ''[[Godzilla vs. King Ghidorah]]'' features a robotic version - Mecha-King Ghidorah - equipped with grappling cables and a mechanical arm that can discharge electricity and is capable of lifting Godzilla.&lt;ref name="GvKG"/&gt;

In ''[[Rebirth of Mothra III]]'', King Ghidorah gains energy from eating victims and can construct a dome to house its victims for future consumption. It is also portrayed as capable of firing lightning bolts from its wings and regenerating its entire body from severed body parts.&lt;ref name="RoMIII"/&gt; ''[[Godzilla, Mothra and King Ghidorah: Giant Monsters All-Out Attack]]'' features a version that can electrocute enemies via its teeth and can gain power by absorbing the spirits of dead monsters, allowing it to form an energy shield capable of deflecting Godzilla's atomic heat ray.&lt;ref name="GMK"/&gt; 

In ''[[Godzilla: King of the Monsters (2019 film)|Godzilla: King of the Monsters]]'', Ghidorah has a divergent frontal lobe density in each of its heads, rendering each head capable of independent thoughts. Its scales are capable of running bioelectrical currents through its body and its dermal layer is coated with aurum. It can generate "hurricane-force" winds due to hyper-tensile on the muscle tendons of the wings. Its body's electro-receptor molecular biology can create electrical currents and localized storm systems as it travels. This results in the [[stratosphere]] being torn open by thunder and lightning as it takes flight.&lt;ref name="Monarch Files"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://screenrant.com/godzilla-2-monarch-site-every-secret/|title=Here's Every Hidden Secret On Godzilla 2's Viral Website|first=Hannah|last=Shaw-Williams|work=Screen Rant|date=July 18, 2018|accessdate=July 18, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reception===
The character has been well-received and is considered to be the most famous enemy of Godzilla. [[WatchMojo.com]] listed King Ghidorah as #1 on their "Top 10 Godzilla Villains" list,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4zR__HFvn0|title=Top 10 Godzilla Villains|last=WatchMojo.com|first=|work=YouTube|date=September 25, 2015|accessdate=September 25, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and #6 on their "Top 10 Giant Movie Monsters" list,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Eex1-DTbgc|title=Top 10 Giant Movie Monsters|last=WatchMojo.com|first=|work=YouTube|date=August 31, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; while [[IGN]] listed the creature as #2 on their "Top 10 Japanese Movie Monsters" list.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/05/15/top-10-japanese-movie-monsters?page=2|title=Top 10 Japanese Movie Monsters|last=Hawker|first=Tom|work=IGN|date=May 15, 2014|accessdate=May 17, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Complex (magazine)|Complex]]'' listed the character as #4 on its "The 15 Most Badass Kaiju Monsters of All Time" list, calling it "iconic" and "...simply looks cooler than some of the more powerful bugs, crabs, and robots."&lt;ref&gt;Josh Robertson, [http://uk.complex.com/pop-culture/2014/05/most-badass-kaiju-monsters-of-all-time/ "The 15 Most Badass Kaiju Monsters of All Time"], ''[[Complex (magazine)|Complex]]'' (May 18, 2014)&lt;/ref&gt;

In his review of ''[[Ghidorah, the Three-Headed Monster]]'', Ethan Reed of ''Toho Kingdom'' praised King Ghidorah, calling it "a fantastic addition to the franchise" and "no less than pure evil, a relentless force of destruction that wipes out the life of entire planets just for the sake of it" and concluded that "King Ghidorah is not only one the best characters in the series, but one [of] the best movie villains as well."&lt;ref&gt;Ethan Reed, [http://www.tohokingdom.com/reviews/sub/ethan_reed/gtthm.htm "Review: Ghidorah, the Three-Headed Monster (1964)"], ''Toho Kingdom'' (July 22, 2009)&lt;/ref&gt; Similar views were expressed in ''[[Paste (magazine)|Paste]]'', which listed Ghidorah as #5 on its "10 Best Movie Dragons", describing it as "probably the deadliest beast in all of Godzilla lore".&lt;ref&gt;Curt Holman, [https://www.pastemagazine.com/blogs/lists/2013/01/the-10-best-movie-dragons.html "The 10 Best Movie Dragons"], ''[[Paste (magazine)|Paste]]'' (January 3, 2013)&lt;/ref&gt;

Godzilla historian Steve Ryfle, however, has criticized Ghidorah's design in ''Godzilla vs. King Ghidorah'', citing its stiff movements and recycled [[Rodan]] roar, as well as noting that it did not deviate enough from Eiji Tsuburaya's original design.{{sfn|Ryfle|1998|p=271}}{{sfn|Ryfle|1998|p=272}}

'''Maintenance''' of an organism is the collection of processes to stay alive, excluding production processes. The [[Dynamic Energy Budget]] theory delineates two classes
* Somatic maintenance mainly comprises the turnover of structural mass (mainly proteins) and the maintenance of concentration gradients of metabolites across membranes (e.g., counteracting leakage). This is related to [[maintenance respiration]].
* Maturity maintenance concerns the maintenance of defence systems (such as the [[immune system]]), and the preparation of the body for reproduction.

The theory assumes that maturity maintenance costs can be reduced more easily during starvation than somatic maintenance costs. Under extreme starvation conditions, somatic maintenance costs are paid from structural mass, which causes shrinking. Some organism manage to switch to the [[turpor]] state under starvation conditions, and reduce their maintenance costs.

'''Maternity blues''', also known as '''baby blues''' and '''postpartum blues''', is a transient condition that 75-80% of mothers could experience shortly after [[childbirth]] with a wide variety of symptoms which generally involve mood [[lability]], tearfulness, and some mild [[anxiety]] and depressive symptoms. Baby blues is not [[postpartum depression]], unless it is abnormally severe.

==Symptoms==
* Weepiness and bursting into tears.
* Sudden [[mood swings]].
* Anxiousness and hypersensitivity to criticism.
* Low spirits and irritability.
* Poor concentration and indecisiveness.
* Feeling 'unbonded' with the baby.
* Restless insomnia.

==Causes==
After the [[placenta]] is delivered, the placental "hormone factory" shuts down causing radical changes in hormone levels, and the woman can suffer symptoms due to withdrawal from the high pregnancy levels of [[Estrogen|estrogen]], [[progesterone]] and [[endorphins]]. Combined with this shift in hormone levels is the physical, mental and emotional exhaustion - as well as [[sleep deprivation]] typical of parenting a newborn. All of these factors contribute to the condition.

It can also be normal for the ovaries (having been virtually inactive for the last six months of the pregnancy) to take a number of weeks to return to producing normal pre-pregnancy hormone levels.

This condition may also be associated with thyroid dysfunction.&lt;ref name="pmid9564106"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Ijuin T, Douchi T, Yamamoto S, Ijuin Y, Nagata Y |title=The relationship between maternity blues and thyroid dysfunction |journal=J. Obstet. Gynaecol. Res. |volume=24 |issue=1 |pages=49–55 |date=February 1998 |pmid=9564106 |doi= 10.1111/j.1447-0756.1998.tb00052.x|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An association with [[serotonin]] has been suggested.&lt;ref name="pmid18502014"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Doornbos B, Fekkes D, Tanke MA, de Jonge P, Korf J |title=Sequential serotonin and noradrenalin associated processes involved in postpartum blues |journal=Prog. Neuropsychopharmacol. Biol. Psychiatry |volume=32 |issue=5 |pages=1320–5 |date=July 2008 |pmid=18502014 |doi=10.1016/j.pnpbp.2008.04.010 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0278-5846(08)00112-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Baby pinks==
Instead of having the baby blues, some women experience ''baby pinks'' when they are overly and illogically on top of the world (a mild to severe form of [[mania]]). These symptoms can sometimes be a trigger for a pending depressive imbalance, such as [[postpartum depression]] or [[postnatal psychosis]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

The '''Mingo Oak''' (also known as the '''Mingo White Oak''') was a [[Quercus alba|white oak]] (''Quercus alba'') in the [[U.S. state]] of [[West Virginia]]. First recognized for its age and size in 1931, the Mingo Oak was the oldest and largest living white oak tree in the world until its death in 1938.

The Mingo Oak stood in [[Mingo County, West Virginia|Mingo County]], West Virginia, in a [[Cove (Appalachian Mountains)|cove]] at the base of Trace Mountain near the headwaters of the Trace Fork of Pigeon Creek, a tributary stream of [[Tug Fork]]. The tree reached a height of over {{convert|200|ft|m}}, and its [[Trunk (botany)|trunk]] was {{convert|145|ft|m}} in height. Its [[Crown (botany)|crown]] measured {{convert|130|ft|m}} in [[diameter]] and {{convert|60|ft|m}} in height. The tree's trunk measured {{convert|9|ft|10|in|m}} in diameter and the [[circumference]] of its base measured {{convert|30|ft|9|in|m}}. Assessments of its potential board [[lumber]] ranged from {{convert|15000|ft|m}} to {{convert|40000|ft|m}}. Following the tree's [[felling]] in 1938, it was estimated to weigh approximately {{convert|5500|t|LT|order=flip}}.

While the tree had long been known about for its size, the unique status of the Mingo Oak was not recognized until 1931, when John Keadle and Leonard Bradshaw of [[Williamson, West Virginia|Williamson]] took measurements of the tree, and found it to be the largest living white oak in the world. Various estimates place the Mingo Oak's seeding between 1354 and 1361 AD. Using borings from the tree, the [[Smithsonian Institution]] determined that the Mingo Oak was the oldest tree of its species. The Island Creek Coal Company, the North East Lumber Company, and the Cole and Crane Real Estate Trust leased {{convert|1.5|acre|ha}} encompassing the tree to the [[West Virginia Division of Natural Resources|West Virginia Game, Fish, and Forestry Commission]] for it to be managed as a [[state park]] for the life of the tree. The commission cleared the surrounding land and made improvements such as seating and picnic accommodations for visitors.

By the spring of 1938, the Mingo Oak failed to produce leaves, and on May of that year, West Virginia state forester D.&amp;nbsp;B. Griffin announced the tree's death. The prevailing theory is that the tree died from the release of poisonous gases and [[sulfur]] fumes from a burning [[spoil tip]] in nearby Trace Gap. The tree was felled with fanfare on September 23, 1938, with transections being sent to the Smithsonian Institution and the West Virginia State Museum. Under the terms of the Island Creek Coal Company's lease with the West Virginia Game, Fish, and Forestry Commission, the land's lease around the former tree reverted to the company following the tree's felling.

== Geography and setting ==
[[File:Cumberlandplateaumap.png|upright|thumb|right|A map illustrating the [[Allegheny Plateau]] and the [[Allegheny Mountains|Allegheny]] and [[Cumberland Mountains|Cumberland]] mountain ranges of the [[Appalachian Mountains]]|alt=A map illustrating the Allegheny Plateau and the Allegheny and Cumberland mountain ranges of the Appalachian Mountains]]
Prior to the arrival of [[European American]] [[settler]]s and [[Exploration|explorers]], the [[Allegheny Plateau]] region of [[West Virginia]], lying to the west of the [[Allegheny Mountains|Allegheny]] and [[Cumberland Mountains|Cumberland]] mountain ranges of the [[Appalachian Mountains]], was overlaid with [[old-growth forest]]s consisting predominantly of [[deciduous]] mixed [[oak]]s and [[chestnut]] trees.&lt;ref name = "Lewis1"&gt;{{Harvnb|Lewis|1998|p=18.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Cove (Appalachian Mountains)|cove forests]] of the Appalachian Mountains were undisturbed for approximately 300 million years, and the ample moisture and deep soils of cove topography allowed for the proliferation of [[temperate broadleaf and mixed forest]] species.&lt;ref name = "Abramson1"&gt;{{Harvnb|Abramson|Haskell|2006|p=53.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The largest of the tree [[species]] in this virgin timbershed was the [[Quercus alba|white oak]] (''Quercus alba''), which often exceeded {{convert|100|ft|m}} in [[height]] and {{convert|6|ft|m}} in [[diameter]].&lt;ref name = "Lewis1"/&gt; While the white oak's range encompasses most of the [[Eastern United States]], the most favorable environments for its growth are on the western slopes of the Appalachian Mountains.&lt;ref name = "Core1"&gt;{{Harvnb|Core|1971|p=19.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "USFS1"&gt;{{Silvics | volume = 2 | genus = Quercus | species = alba | last = Rogers | first = Robert | accessdate = October 6, 2015 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20151006022342/http://www.na.fs.fed.us/pubs/silvics_manual/volume_2/quercus/alba.htm | archive-date = October 6, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[botany|botanist]] [[Earl Lemley Core]], the species flourishes on northern mountain flanks, and in coves, which are small valleys or ravines between two ridge lines that are closed at one or both ends.&lt;ref name = "Core1"/&gt; White oaks also thrive in moist lowlands and in upland topography, with the exception of extremely dry ridges with shallow soil.&lt;ref name = "Core1"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "USFS1"/&gt;

The Mingo Oak, known alternatively as the Mingo White Oak, was a white oak that stood in such a cove at the base of Trace Mountain on a shelf near the [[River source|headwaters]] of the Trace Fork of Pigeon Creek, a tributary stream of [[Tug Fork]].&lt;ref name="BPH1"&gt;{{cite news | last = Talbott | first = Lowell | title = Mingo Oak, State's Oldest 'Resident' Died in '38 | newspaper = Beckley Post-Herald and The Raleigh Register | publication-place = [[Beckley, West Virginia]] | date = October 3, 1965 | page = 6 | url = https://www.newspapers.com/image/40930224/ | accessdate = October 5, 2015 | via = [[Newspapers.com]] | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20151006072020/http://www.newspapers.com/image/40930224/ | archivedate = October 6, 2015 | df = mdy-all }} {{Open access}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "Randall1"&gt;{{Harvnb|Randall|Edgerton|1938|p=100.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "Vanscoy1"&gt;{{Harvnb| Vanscoy |1938|p=16.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The tree was located near the [[census-designated place]] of [[Holden, West Virginia|Holden]], {{convert|10|mi|km}} from [[Logan, West Virginia|Logan]] and {{convert|1|mi|km}} from the [[Logan County, West Virginia|Logan County]] line in [[Mingo County, West Virginia|Mingo County]], from which it took its name.&lt;ref name = "Randall1"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "HHA1"&gt;{{cite news| last = King | first = Henry  | title =Mingo County White Oak Will Be Felled Friday, Fungus Is Fatal To Forest Giant After 584 Years | newspaper = Huntington Herald-Advertiser | publication-place = [[Huntington, West Virginia]] | date =September 18, 1938 | url = http://www.wvculture.org/history/parks/mingooak02.html | accessdate = October 6, 2015 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20151006022736/http://www.wvculture.org/history/parks/mingooak02.html | archive-date = October 6, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The county was in turn named for the [[Mingo]] [[Iroquois]] peoples, of which [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] war leader [[Logan (American Indian leader)|Logan]] was affiliated.&lt;ref name = "WVL1"&gt;{{Harvnb|West Virginia Legislature|2011|p=828.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "WVDCH2"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.wvculture.org/history/counties/mingo.html | title = Mingo County: County Facts | work = West Virginia Archives and History | publisher = West Virginia Division of Culture and History | accessdate = October 6, 2015 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150205110520/http://www.wvculture.org/history/counties/mingo.html | archive-date=February 5, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Holden was the base of operations of the Island Creek Coal Company, which leased the land where the tree was located.&lt;ref name = "HHA1"/&gt;

[[File:MingoOak2-closeup of growth rings.jpg|thumb|upright|The Mingo Oak's [[Dendrochronology#Growth rings|growth rings]]|alt=Cross section cut of an oak tree's trunk which reveals its growth rings]]
The Mingo Oak was the largest specimen of these giant white oaks that dotted the old-growth forests of pre-settlement West Virginia.&lt;ref name = "Lewis1"/&gt; The tree was found to be the largest living white oak in the United States, and in the world, following a survey of white oaks throughout the country.

Ownership of the timber land around the tree was eventually acquired by the Cole and Crane Real Estate Trust, which leased the timbering rights to the North East Lumber Company. Under the lease agreement, the North East Lumber Company only paid for the lumber that it cleared from the land. The company found the Mingo Oak too large to cut down, and assessed that its removal was too costly to undertake.&lt;ref name = "HHA1"/&gt; The Cole and Crane Real Estate Trust also leased out the land where the tree was located to the Island Creek Coal Company for mining.&lt;ref name = "WVDCH1"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.wvculture.org/history/parks/mingooak03.html | title = Mingo Oak: Correspondence Between Emmett Keadle and Governor William Conley Regarding the Mingo Oak| work = West Virginia Archives and History | publisher = West Virginia Division of Culture and History | accessdate = October 6, 2015 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20151006023027/http://www.wvculture.org/history/parks/mingooak03.html | archive-date = October 6, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The land around the tree continued to be developed. A highway connecting Logan to Williamson, was built parallel to the Trace Fork of Pigeon Creek, opposite the Mingo Oak. While the tree had long been known for its size, the unique status of the Mingo Oak was not recognized until 1931, when John Keadle and Leonard Bradshaw of Williamson took measurements of the tree, and found it to be the largest living white oak in the world.&lt;ref name = "CDM1"/&gt; Upon this finding by the two men, Cole and Crane Real Estate Trust and the Island Creek Coal Company agreed to make a joint deed conveying the property to the state of West Virginia. In late 1931, Emmett Keadle of the West Virginia Oil and Grease Company wrote a letter to Governor [[William G. Conley]] informing him of the tree's significance and the companies' willingness to lease the land to the state. Governor Conley responded to Keadle and suggested the companies convey the property to the [[West Virginia Division of Natural Resources|West Virginia Game, Fish, and Forestry Commission]].&lt;ref name = "WVDCH1"/&gt;

The Island Creek Coal Company, the North East Lumber Company, and the Cole and Crane Real Estate Trust leased to the commission {{convert|1.5|acre|ha}} encompassing the tree for it to be managed as a [[state park]] for the lifetime of the tree.&lt;ref name = "HHA1"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "BDT1"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "CDM1"/&gt; The commission removed vegetation from the immediate land around the tree, constructed a fence around the plot, and built a bridge crossing the Trace Fork of Pigeon Creek so that motorists could access the park from the highway.&lt;ref name = "HHA1"/&gt; The state built cooking ovens, [[picnic table]]s, and benches along the tree's southern slopes.&lt;ref name = "HHA2"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "CDM1"/&gt; Also, due to its enormous size and advanced age, the Mingo Oak acquired spiritual and inspirational significance. It became a place of worship, and a pulpit and benches were built beneath its branches. During the summer months, outdoor sermons were delivered by preachers at the tree. The Mingo Oak was also credited with raising awareness of conservation.&lt;ref name = "BPH1"/&gt;

The Mingo Oak became a popular attraction for visitors. Conferences, such as the annual conference of the West Virginia [[Parent-Teacher Association]] in 1933, included visits to the tree as part of their itineraries.&lt;ref name="CDM2"&gt;{{cite news| title =State P.-T.

== Death ==
In the summer of 1937, the Mingo Oak scarcely sprouted leaves on only a couple of its branches.&lt;ref name = "HHA2"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "Chafin1"&gt;{{Harvnb|Chafin|2014|p=102.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 1938, biologist Earl M. Vanscoy wrote in ''[[Castanea (journal)|Castanea]]'' that the tree was "almost dead" due to the release of poisonous gases and [[sulfur]] fumes from a coal [[spoil tip]] of the Island Creek Coal Company, which had been burning nearby in Trace Gap.&lt;ref name = "BPH1"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "Vanscoy1"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "Clarkson1"&gt;{{Harvnb|Clarkson|1964|p=7.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the spring of 1938, the tree failed to produce any leaves.&lt;ref name = "HHA1"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "NYT1"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "Chafin1"/&gt; White oaks flower in the spring at approximately the same time as their leaves form, between late March and late May.&lt;ref name = "USFS1"/&gt; On May 4, 1938, West Virginia's state forester, D.&amp;nbsp;B. Griffin, announced that the Mingo Oak was dead.&lt;ref name = "Randall1"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "NYT1"/&gt; Griffin also noted that a [[fungus]] that only lived on dead or dying trees had been present on the tree for several months prior to its death.&lt;ref name = "NYT1"/&gt; The prevailing theory is that the tree died as a result of suffocation from the fumes of the burning pile of coal waste;&lt;ref name = "BPH1"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "Vanscoy1"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "Clarkson1"/&gt; however, local media initially reported that the tree was killed as a result of fungal growth.&lt;ref name = "HHA1"/&gt;

== Felling ==
In preparation for the tree's felling, some preliminary cutting was undertaken in the tree's north side in the afternoon hours of September 22. This work was done in order to manipulate the course of the tree's fall, and to estimate the length of time it would take to cut through the remainder of the trunk. After a saw had been worked approximately {{convert|2|ft|m}} into the trunk, it was discovered that the tree was [[decomposition|decomposing]] and open in its center. The lumber crews trimmed the tree's initial cut, and the further work to topple the tree was adjourned until the following morning.&lt;ref name = "HHA2"/&gt;

The tree was felled on September 23 during a ceremony attended by between 2,500 and 3,000 people.&lt;ref name = "BPH1"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "HHA1"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "Chafin1"/&gt; Among those in attendance were state forester D.&amp;nbsp;B. Griffin, the president of the Island Creek Coal Company, E.&amp;nbsp;P. Rice, and representatives from other companies that had previously owned and leased the land where the tree was located.&lt;ref name = "BPH1"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "HHA1"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "HHA2"/&gt; In addition to standard cameras photographing the event, two [[movie camera]]s were brought to capture the felling and its associated events. Uniformed West Virginia Game, Fish, and Forestry Commission officers, Mingo County sheriffs' deputies, and other law enforcement personnel were also on hand to provide security and direct traffic.&lt;ref name = "HHA2"/&gt;

Two lumberman were brought in to facilitate the cutting and toppling of the tree: Paul Criss of Charleston and Ed Meek of [[Indianapolis]].&lt;ref name = "HHA2"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "RE1"&gt;{{cite news| title =Largest White Oak Tree to Be Cut Down | newspaper =Reading Eagle | publication-place = [[Reading, Pennsylvania]] | date = September 23, 1938 | page = 14 | url = https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=phkxAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=luEFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2394%2C4369147 | accessdate = October 6, 2015| via = [[Google News Archive]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Criss brought with him a team of [[Woodchopping|woodchoppers]] and [[Sawyer (occupation)|sawyers]] representing the Kelly Ax and Tool Works Company.&lt;ref name = "HHA2"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "SGM1"/&gt; Criss was a [[public relations]] spokesperson for the Kelly Ax and Tool Works Company.&lt;ref name = "SGM1"/&gt; Meek arrived with his own crew from the E.&amp;nbsp;C. Atkins and Company, a [[saw]] manufacturer. Griffin also enlisted the assistance of a crew of [[game warden]]s and [[Park ranger|rangers]]. A nearby [[Civilian Conservation Corps]] camp also provided a team to assist in the felling and dismemberment of the tree. The E.&amp;nbsp;C. Atkins and Company also brought a {{convert|9|ft|m|adj=on}} saw. Most of the readily available [[crosscut saw]]s measured {{convert|6|ft|m}} in length, thus rendering them ineffective at cutting through the tree's wide trunk, which measured over {{convert|6|ft|m}} in diameter {{convert|3|ft|m}} from the ground.&lt;ref name = "HHA2"/&gt;

Prior to the tree's cutting, Criss shaved Meek's face with his [[axe]]. He lathered Meek's face and neck and moved his axe blade over Meek's bristles, drawing blood at his chin line. Criss commented: "That's the trouble with having a lot of officials around. I've shaved a thousand men with that axe and that's the first time I ever drew blood. These officials get me a little nervous."&lt;ref name = "HHA2"/&gt;

By 09:00, hundreds of people had arrived to observe the tree's toppling. At 10:00, the final cutting commenced. Criss decided to topple the tree downhill onto a ledge, which narrowed between the two ravines that emptied into Trace Fork. While it was assessed that the shelf was not long enough for the tree to land on, it was agreed upon by all the participants that given the rotten nature of the tree's top section, it would fracture notwithstanding the orientation of its fall. Prior to Criss cutting further into the tree, he assured the crews: "I can put her anywhere you want her gentlemen. Lay a [[United States ten-dollar bill|$10 bill]] anywhere you like and I'll guarantee the trunk will cover it."&lt;ref name = "HHA2"/&gt;

The cutting of the tree began when the {{convert|9|ft|m|adj=on}} saw, operated by six men, was positioned across the trunk. The saw penetrated the trunk, and the adjacent area was cleared of bystanders. The spectators were repositioned up the hillside to the south and across the ravine to land that had previously been cleared by the Civilian Conservation Corps camp. The men moved the saw backward and forward, as woodchoppers widened the open wedge. After approximately 30 minutes, Criss yelled, "We're through boys."&lt;ref name = "HHA2"/&gt; The men removed the saw, and the woodchoppers continued to pick at the open wedge. The tree made a crackling sound, its upper limbs dipped, and the Mingo Oak crashed onto its designated felling location.&lt;ref name = "HHA2"/&gt; While it had been intended that the tree be down by 10:30, it was not until 11:00 that this occurred.&lt;ref name = "Chafin1"/&gt; To assist in the segmentation of the collapsed tree, competitions were held in woodchopping and log sawing. Saw manufacturer E.&amp;nbsp;C. Atkins and Company furnished saws for the competitors.&lt;ref name = "HHA1"/&gt;

Because of the tree's advanced decomposition within the center of its base, the trunk's lowest {{convert|24|ft|m}} were assessed to be worthless; however, {{convert|66|ft|m}} of the trunk was salvaged in one entire piece. Another cutting yielded a {{convert|40|ft|m|adj=on}} log in length, that averaged {{convert|54|in|cm}} in diameter. The Island Creek Coal Company sent the {{convert|66|ft|m|adj=on}} log to the [[Meadow River Lumber Company]] plant in [[Rainelle, West Virginia|Rainelle]], which had the largest [[Miter saw|cutoff saw]] in the Eastern United States. From this log, transections were cut, and other divisions of it produced lumber, tabletops, and novelty items.&lt;ref name = "HHA2"/&gt; Various segments of the tree were cut and given to the West Virginia State Museum and the Smithsonian Institution.&lt;ref name = "BPH1"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "Chafin1"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="64326">The term "'''missing women'''" indicates a shortfall in the number of women relative to the expected number of women in a region or country. It is most often measured through male-to-female [[sex ratio]]s, and is theorized to be caused by [[sex-selective abortion]]s, [[female infanticide]], and inadequate healthcare and nutrition for female children. It is argued that technologies that enable prenatal [[sex selection]], which have been commercially available since the 1970s, are a large impetus for missing female children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Sen | first1 = A | year = 2003 | title = Missing women--revisited: reduction in female mortality has been counterbalanced by sex selective abortions | journal = British Medical Journal | volume = 327 | issue = 7427| pages = 1297–1299 | doi=10.1136/bmj.327.7427.1297 | pmid=14656808 | pmc=286281}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The phenomenon was first noted by the Indian [[Nobel Prize in Economics|Nobel Prize]]-winning [[economist]] [[Amartya Sen]] in an essay in ''[[The New York Review of Books]]'' in 1990,&lt;ref name="Sen"&gt;{{cite journal|first=Amartya |last=Sen |authorlink=Amartya Sen |title=More Than 100 Million Women Are Missing |journal=New York Review of Books |volume=37 |issue=20 |date=20 December 1990 |url=http://ucatlas.ucsc.edu/gender/Sen100M.html |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130504072819/http://ucatlas.ucsc.edu/gender/Sen100M.html |archivedate=4 May 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and expanded upon in his subsequent academic work. Sen originally estimated that more than a hundred million women were "missing." Later researchers found differing numbers, with most recent estimates around ninety to 101 million women.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="hudsonboer" /&gt; These effects are concentrated in countries typically in [[Asia]], the [[Middle East]] and northern [[Africa]].&lt;ref name="Sen" /&gt; However, the disparity has also been found in Chinese and Indian [[Immigration|immigrant]] communities in the [[United States]], albeit to a far lesser degree than in Asia. An estimated 2000 Chinese and Indian female unborn children were aborted between 1991 and 2004, and a shortage can be traced back as far as 1980.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Are There Missing Girls in the United States? Evidence from Birth Data|first=Jason|last=Abrevaya|date=1 March 2009|journal=American Economic Journal: Applied Economics|volume=1|issue=2|pages=1–34|doi=10.1257/app.1.2.1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some countries in the [[former Soviet Union]] also saw declines in female births after the [[revolutions of 1989]], particularly in the [[Caucasus]] region.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=https://www.economist.com/europe/2013/09/21/gendercide-in-the-caucasus|title=Gendercide in the Caucasus|journal=The Economist|date=2013-09-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other economists, notably [[Emily Oster]], have questioned Sen's explanation, and argued that the shortfall was due to a higher prevalence of the [[hepatitis B]] virus in Asia compared to Europe; however, her later research established that Hepatitis B cannot account for more than an insignificant fraction of the missing women.&lt;ref name="revision" /&gt; Researchers have also argued that other diseases, [[HIV/AIDS|HIVS/AIDS]], natural causes, and female abduction are also responsible for missing women.&lt;ref name="Diseases" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Stillwaggon" /&gt;&lt;ref name="rjhmam" /&gt;&lt;ref name="N1" /&gt; However, son preference, as well as associated reasons to care for male well-being over female well-being, is still considered to the primary cause.&lt;ref&gt;John, Mary E., Ravinder Kaur, Rajni Palriwala, Sarawati Raju, and Alpana Sagar. 2008. ''Planning Families, Planning Gender: The Adverse Child Sex Ratio in Selected Districts of Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, Himachal Pradesh, Haryana, and Punjab''. New Delhi: Action
Aid/IDRC&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to the health and wellbeing of women, the missing women phenomenon has led to an excess of males in society and an imperfectly balanced marriage market. Because of the association of missing women with female neglect, countries with higher rates of missing women also tend to have higher rates of women in poor health, leading to higher rates of infants in poor health.&lt;ref name="Sen update" /&gt;

Researchers argue that increasing women's education and women's employment opportunities can help decrease the number of missing women, but the effects of these policy solutions differ greatly between countries due to differing levels of ingrained sexism between cultures.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Sen 1992 587" /&gt; Various international measures have been instituted to combat the problem of missing women.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; For example, to bring awareness to the problem of missing women, the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development|OECD]] measures the number of missing women through the "Son preference" parameter in its [[Social Institutions and Gender Index|SIGI index]].&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

==The problem and prevalence==
According to Sen, even though women make up the majority of the world's population, the proportion of women in each country's population varies drastically from country to country, with various countries having fewer women than men.&lt;ref name=Sen /&gt; This runs contrary to research that females tend to have better survival rates than males, given the same amount of nutritional and medical attention.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Waldron|first=Ingrid|year=1983|title=Sex differences in human mortality: The role of genetic factors|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&amp;_udi=B6VBF-4665DFS-NT&amp;_user=1047253&amp;_coverDate=12%2F31%2F1983&amp;_rdoc=1&amp;_fmt=high&amp;_orig=gateway&amp;_origin=gateway&amp;_sort=d&amp;_docanchor=&amp;view=c&amp;_searchStrId=1708949007&amp;_rerunOrigin=google&amp;_acct=C000050919&amp;_version=1&amp;_urlVersion=0&amp;_userid=1047253&amp;md5=8bc4a448ab82f1c5a46dad1c803f2e00&amp;searchtype=a|journal=Social Science &amp; Medicine|volume=17|issue=6|pages=321–333|doi=10.1016/0277-9536(83)90234-4|accessdate=7 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; To capture this divergence from natural sex ratios, the count of "missing women" is measured as a comparison of a country's male-to-female (or female-to-male) sex ratio compared to the natural sex ratio. Unlike female mortality rates, estimates of "missing women" include counts of sex-specific abortions, which Sen cites as a large factor contributing to the disparity of sex ratios from country to country.&lt;ref name="Sen" /&gt; Furthermore, female mortality rates fail to account for intergenerational effects from female discrimination, while a comparison of a country's sex ratio to natural sex ratios would.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite journal|last2=Wink|first2=Claudia|year=2003|title=Missing Women: Revisiting the Debate|journal=Feminist Economics|volume=9|issue=2–3|page=270|doi=10.1080/1354570022000077999|last1=Klausen|first1=Stephan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sen's original research found that while there are typically more women than men in European and North American countries ([[List of countries by sex ratio|at around 0.98 men to 1 woman for most countries]]), the sex ratio of developing countries in Asia, as well as the Middle East, is much higher (in number of males for each female). For example, in China, the ratio of men to women is 1.06, far higher than most countries. The ratio is much higher than that for those born after 1985, when [[ultrasound]] technology became widely available. Using actual numbers, this means that in China alone, there are 50 million women "missing" – that should be there but are not. Adding up similar numbers from South and West Asia results in a number of "missing" women higher than 100 million.&lt;ref name="Sen"/&gt;

According to Sen, "These numbers tell us, quietly, a terrible story of inequality and neglect leading to the excess mortality of women."&lt;ref name="Sen" /&gt;

===Estimates===
Since Sen's original research, continued research in the field has led to varying estimates on the total numbers of missing women. Much of this variation is because of underlying assumptions for "normal" birth sex ratios and expected post-birth mortality rates for men and women.

Sen's original calculations using 1980s and 1990s data for missing women were indexed using the average sex ratio in Western Europe and North America as the natural sex ratio, through assuming that in these countries men and women received equal care. After further research, he updated these numbers with Sub-Saharan African sex ratios. Using these countries' sex ratios as the baseline and male-female populations from other countries as the data, he concluded that over 100 million women were missing, primarily in Asia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sen|first=Amartya|year=1990|title=More than 100 million women are missing.|journal=The New York Review of Books|volume=37}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, later authors pointed out that Europe tended to have higher rates of male mortality due to multiple wars and generally risky behavior.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Due to male workers migrating from rural to urban regions, [[immigration]], and world war, a culture of "high masculinity" existed in these countries, while on the other hand, in other countries such as India, traditions regarding the discriminatory treatment of female children were stronger from the late 1950s to mid-1980s.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Coale|first=Ansley|year=1991|title=Excess Female Mortality and the Balance of the Sexes in the Population: An Estimate of the Number of "Missing Females|journal=Population and Development Review|series=3|volume=17|issue=3|pages=517–523|doi=10.2307/1971953|jstor=1971953}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a result of this disparity between countries, American demographer [[Ansley J. Coale|Coale]] re-estimated the Sen's original numbers of missing women using a different methodology. Using data from his [[Ansley J. Coale|Regional Model Life Tables]], Coale found that the natural male-to-female sex ratio, accounting for different country fertility rates and circumstances, had an expected value of 1.059. Using the number, he then arrived at an estimate of 60 million missing women, much lower than Sen's original estimate.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; However, a few years later, [http://wiki-goettingen.de/index.php?title=Stephan_Klasen Klasen] re-calculated the count of missing women using Coale's methodology with updated data. He found 69.3 million missing women, which was higher than Coale's original estimate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Klasen|first=Stephan|date=1994|title="Missing Women" reconsidered|url=|journal=World Development|volume=22|issue=7|pages=1061–1071|doi=|pmid=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also noted a problem with the Regional Model Life Tables; they were based on countries with higher female mortality, which would bias Coale's numbers of missing women downwards. Furthermore, Klasen and Wink noted that both Sen's and Coale's methodologies were flawed because Sen and Coale assume that optimal sex ratios are constant across time and space, which they are often not.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Klasen and Wink conducted a study in 2003 with updated census data. Using life expectancy to instrument for sex ratio at birth (which would account for non-constant sex ratios as well as biases from the Regional Model Life Tables), they estimated 101 million missing women across the world.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Overall they found trends that showed that while West Asia, North Africa and most of South Asia saw more equal sex ratios, China's and South Korea's ratios worsened. In fact, Klasen and Wink noted that China was responsible for 80% of the rise in missing women from between 1994 and 2003.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Sex-selective abortions were given as reasons for the lack of improvement in India and China, while women's growing educational and employment opportunities were cited as reasons for the ratio improvement in other previously low ratio countries such as Sri Lanka.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Klasen|first=Stephan|date=2002|title=A turning point in gender bias in mortality? An update on the number of missing women|journal=Population and Development Review|series=2|volume=28|issue=2|pages=285–312|doi=10.1111/j.1728-4457.2002.00285.x|author2=Claudia Wink|citeseerx=10.1.1.594.9344}}&lt;/ref&gt; Klasen and Wink also noted that similar to both Sen's and Coale's results, Pakistan had the world's highest percentage of missing girls relative to its total pre-adult female population.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Later estimates have tended to have higher numbers of missing women. For example, a 2005 study estimated that over 90 million females were "missing" from the expected population in [[Afghanistan]], [[Bangladesh]], [[China]], [[India]], [[Pakistan]], [[South Korea]] and [[Taiwan]] alone.&lt;ref name="hudsonboer"&gt;VALERIE M.

===Differences within countries/states===
Even within countries, the prevalence of missing women can vary drastically. Das Gupta observed that the preference for boys and the resulting shortage of girls was more pronounced in the more highly developed [[Haryana]] and [[Punjab (India)|Punjab]] regions of India than in poorer areas. This prejudice was most prevalent among the more educated and affluent women and mothers in those two regions. In the Punjab region, girls did not receive inferior treatment if a girl was born as a first child in a given family, when the parents still had high hopes for obtaining a son later. However, subsequent births of girls were unwelcome, because each such birth diminished a chance of the family having a son. Because more affluent and educated women would have fewer offspring, they were therefore under more acute pressure to produce a son as early as possible. As ultrasound imaging and other techniques increasingly allowed early prediction of the child's sex, more affluent families opted for an abortion. Alternatively, if the girl was born, the family would decrease her chance of survival by not providing sufficient medical or nutritional care. As a result, in India there are more missing women in developed urban areas, than in rural regions.&lt;ref name="Rosenberg"&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/23/magazine/23FOB-idealab-t.html?_r=1&amp;scp=1&amp;sq=The%20Daughter%20Deficit&amp;st=cse "The Daughter Deficit"] by Tina Rosenberg, The New York Times Magazine, August 23, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Das Gupta|first=Monica|date=2005|title=Explaining Asia's "Missing Women": A New Look at the Data|url=|journal=Population and Development Review|issue=31(3)|pages=529–535|doi=|pmid=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, in China, rural areas have a larger missing women problem than urban areas. China's regional differences lead to different attitudes towards the one-child policy.  Urban areas have been found to be easier to enforce the policy, due to the danwei system, a generally more educated urban population – understanding that one child is easier to care for and keep healthy than two.  In more rural areas where farming is labor-intensive and couples depend on male offspring to take care of them in old age, males children are preferred to females.&lt;ref name="N1" /&gt;

Even developed countries face problems with missing women. The bias against girls is very evident among the relatively highly developed, middle-class dominated nations ([[Taiwan]], [[South Korea]], [[Singapore]], [[Armenia]], [[Azerbaijan]], [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]]) and the immigrant Asian communities in the [[United States]] and [[United Kingdom|Britain]]. Only recently and in some countries (particularly South Korea) have the development and educational campaigns begun to turn the tide, resulting in more normal gender ratios.&lt;ref name="Rosenberg" /&gt;

===Under-reporting===
Some evidence suggests that in Asia, especially in China with its [[one-child policy]], additional fertility behavior, infant deaths, and female birth information may be hidden or not reported. Instead of policy expanding women's opportunities for gainful employment policy, from 1979 onward the one-child policy has added upon the son preference causing the largest number of missing women in any country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bulte|first=Erwin |author2=Nico Heenrink |author3=Xiaobo Zhang|title=China's One‐Child Policy and 'the Mystery of Missing Women': Ethnic Minorities and Male‐Biased Sex Ratios*.|journal=Oxford Bulletin of Economics and Statistics|date=2011|volume=73|series=1|pages=21–39|doi=10.1111/j.1468-0084.2010.00601.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
As parents are eager to have sons and are allowed only one child, some first born females are not reported with the hope that their next child will be a son.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Merli|first=Giovanna|author2=Adrian E. Raftery|title=Are births underreported in rural China? Manipulation of statistical records in response to China's population policies.|journal=Demography|year=2000|volume=37|series=1|pages=109–126|doi=10.2307/2648100|pmid=10748993|issue=1|jstor=2648100}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Goodkind|first=Daniel|title=Child underreporting, fertility, and sex ratio imbalance in China.|journal=Demography|year=2011|volume=48|issue=1|series=1|pages=291–316|doi=10.1007/s13524-010-0007-y|pmid=21336689|url=https://zenodo.org/record/1232976|type=Submitted manuscript}}&lt;/ref&gt; Surviving children who live unreported suffer by not having access to [[health insurance]], lower chances receiving and education and often live with the feeling that they are a burden to their families.

In the other direction, migration, especially to GCC countries, has become a larger issue for sex ratio estimates. Because many male migrants move across borders without their families, there is a large influx in the number of males, which would bias the sex ratios towards more missing women, even when there are not.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==Causes==

===Sen's original argument===
Sen argued that the disparity in sex ratio across eastern Asian countries like India, China, and Korea when compared to North America and Europe, as seen in 1992, could only be explained by deliberate nutritional and health deprivations against women and female children. These deprivations are caused by cultural mechanisms, such as traditions and values, that vary across countries and even regionally within countries.&lt;ref name="Sen update"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.frontline.in/static/html/fl1822/18220040.htm|title=MANY FACES OF GENDER INEQUALITY|last=Sen|first=Amartya|publisher=Frontline|accessdate=2014-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the inherent bias toward male children in many of these countries, female children, if born despite many instances of sex-selective abortion, are born without the same sense of priority given to men. This is especially true in the medical care given to men and women, as well as prioritizing who gets food in less privileged families, leading to lower survival rates than if both genders were treated equally.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = More Than 100 Million Women Are Missing|url = http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/1990/dec/20/more-than-100-million-women-are-missing/|newspaper = The New York Review of Books|date = 1990-12-20|access-date = 2015-09-15|issn = 0028-7504|first = Amartya|last = Sen}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Missing women: adults ====
[[File:Sex ratio over 65 per country smooth 2.png|thumb|450px|The sex ratio by country for the population aged above 65. Red represents &lt;span style="color:red;"&gt;more women&lt;/span&gt;, blue &lt;span style="color:Blue;"&gt;more men&lt;/span&gt; than the world average of 0.79 males/female.]]According to Sen's cooperative conflict model,&lt;ref name="Model"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sen|first=Amartya|title=Gender and cooperative conflicts.|journal=Helsinki: World Institute for Development Economics Research|year=1987}}&lt;/ref&gt; the relations within the household are characterized by both cooperation and conflict: cooperation in the addition of resources and conflict in the division of resources among the household. These intra-household processes are influenced by perceptions of one's [[self-interest]], contribution and welfare.  One's fall back position is the situation for each party once the bargaining process has failed and also determines the ability of each party to survive outside of the relationship.&lt;ref name="Model"/&gt;

Typically, the fall-back position for men who have land ownership rights, more economic opportunities and less care work related to children is better than a woman's fall-back position, who is dependent on her husband for land and income.  According to this framework, when women lack a perception of personal interest and have greater concern for their family welfare gender inequalities are sustained.  Sen argues that women's lower [[bargaining power]] in household decision contributes to the shortfall in female populations across eastern Asia.&lt;ref name="Model"/&gt;

Sen argues that the trend of lower female bargaining power may be positively correlated to the outside [[earning power]] and sense of contribution of women when compared to men. However, not all forms of outside work contribute equally to increasing women's bargaining power in the household; the type of outside work women do has bearing on their entitlements and fall-back position. Women can be doubly exploited in some cases: in [[Narsapur, Medak district|Narsapur,]] India, lace-makers not only face lower bargaining power in the household, but often work for exploitatively low wages. Since lace-making is done in the home, it is perceived as only supplementary to male work rather than a gainful outside contribution. On the other hand, in Allahabad, India, women making cigarettes both gained an independent source of income and an increase in the community's view of their perceived contribution to the household.&lt;ref name="Model" /&gt;

====Missing women: children====
[[File:Sex ratio below 15 per country smooth 2.png|thumb|450px|The sex ratio by country for the population aged below 15. Red represents &lt;span style="color:red;"&gt;more women&lt;/span&gt;, blue &lt;span style="color:Blue;"&gt;more men&lt;/span&gt; than the world average of 1.06 males/female.]]

Sen suggests that in areas with high proportions of missing women, the care and nutrition female children receive are tied to the community's view of their importance. Parents, even mothers, often avoid daughters because of the traditional patriarchal culture in the countries where the elimination of females takes place. Boys are more prized in these regions because they are looked upon as having an economically productive future, while women are not. As parents grow older they can expect much more help and support from their independent sons, than from daughters, who post-marriage functionally become the property of their husbands' families. Even if these daughters are educated and generate significant income, they have limited ability to interact with their natal families. Women are also often practically unable to inherit real estate, so a mother-widow will lose her family's (in reality her late husband's) plot of land and become indigent if she had had only daughters. Poor rural families have meager resources to distribute among their children, which reduces the opportunity to discriminate against girls.&lt;ref name="Rosenberg" /&gt;

Because of selective parental valuation of daughters, even as women are able to afford better healthcare and economic opportunities outside the home, the missing women problem still persists. Notably, [[ultrasound]] technology has exacerbated the problem of missing female children. Ultrasound treatment allows parents to screen out unwanted female fetuses before they are even born. Sen refers to this inequality as "high tech [[sexism]]." He concludes that these biases against women were so "entrenched" that even relative economic improvements in the lives of households have only enabled these parents a different avenue for rejecting their female children. Sen then argued that instead of just increasing women's economic rights and opportunities outside the home a greater emphasis needed to be placed on raising consciousness to eradicate the strong biases against female children.&lt;ref name="Sen update" /&gt;

====The role of fertility====
The natural sex ratio at birth is approximately 105 males for 100 females.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Guilmoto | first1 = C. Z. | year = 2012 | title = Skewed sex ratios at birth and future marriage squeeze in China and India, 2005–2100 | url = | journal = Demography | volume = 49 | issue = 1| pages = 77–100 | doi=10.1007/s13524-011-0083-7| pmid = 22180130 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, because of sex-selective abortions, the sex ratio at birth in countries with high proportions of missing women have ranged 108.5 in India to 121.2 in China.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; As a result, counts of missing women are often due to missing female children.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

Various researchers argue that declining fertility contributes to an intensified problem of missing women.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;Klasen, S. 2008. Missing Women: Some Recent Controversies on Levels and Trends in Gender Bias in Mortality. Ibero America Institute Discussion Paper No. 168. Forthcoming in Basu, K. and R. Kanbur (eds.) Arguments for a better world: Essays in honour of Amartya Sen. Oxford: Oxford University Press (forthcoming).&lt;/ref&gt; This is because families have a preference for sons; a decrease in fertility would mean that families would no longer have children of multiple sexes, but rather a single male child.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; However, Klasen's research has found that other than in countries where policies severely restrict family planning (i.e. China due to the [[One-child policy|One Child Policy]]), fertility is not often associated with higher prevalence of missing women.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; This is because declining fertility is endogenous with other improvements of female well-being such as increasing female education, increasing female employment, and a decrease in gender bias. In fact, as Klasen notes, "In countries where fertility decline has been the largest, the share of missing women has fallen the most."&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

However, this varies between countries. Das Gupta finds that in South Korea, the male-to-female sex ratio spiked from 1.07 to 1.15 between the 1980s and 1990s because of the rising prevalence of ultrasound technology for the use of sex-selective abortions, but declined afterwards between 1990 and 2000 because of increasing modernization, education, and economic opportunities.&lt;ref&gt;Chung, W. and M. Das Gupta, M. 2007. Why is son preference declining in South Korea?
Population and Development Review (forthcoming).&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, in a study contrasting India and Bangladesh, researchers found that India's declining fertility caused a large intensification in son preference and thus an increase in the number of missing women, while declining fertility in Bangladesh led to less missing women.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

===Hepatitis B virus explanation===
In her PhD dissertation at [[Harvard]], Emily Oster argued that Sen's hypothesis did not take account of the different rates of prevalence of the Hepatitis B virus between Asia and other parts of the world.&lt;ref name="phd"&gt;{{cite journal | title=Hepatitis B and the Case of the Missing Women | year=2005 | journal=Journal of Political Economy | volume=113 | issue=6 | pages=1163&amp;ndash;1216 | url=http://home.uchicago.edu/~eoster/hepb.pdf | accessdate=2007-08-01 | doi=10.1086/498588 | last1=Oster | first1=Emily | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070703224905/http://home.uchicago.edu/~eoster/hepb.pdf | archivedate=2007-07-03 | df= | citeseerx=10.1.1.319.912 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Regions with higher rates of Hepatitis B infection tend to have higher ratios of male to female births for biological reasons which are not yet well understood, but which have been extensively documented.

While the disease is fairly uncommon in US and Europe, it is [[endemic (epidemiology)|endemic]] in China and very common in other parts of Asia. Oster argued that this difference in disease prevalence could account for about 45% of the supposed "missing women", and even as high as 75% of the ones in China. Furthermore, Oster showed that the introduction of a [[Hepatitis B vaccine]] had a lagged effect of equalizing the gender ratio towards what one would expect if other factors did not play a role.&lt;ref name="phd"/&gt;

====Subsequent research====
Oster's challenge was met with counter arguments of its own as researchers tried to sort out the available data and control for other possible confounding factors. Avraham Ebenstein questioned Oster's conclusion based on the fact that among first born children the sex ratio is close to the natural one. It is the skewed female-male ratios among second and third born children that account for the bulk of the disparity. In other words, if Hepatitis B was responsible for the skewed ratio then one would expect it to be true among all children, regardless of [[birth order]].

However, the fact that the skewness arose less among the later born than among the first born children, suggested that factors other than the disease were involved.&lt;ref name="avi"&gt;{{cite journal | title=Fertility Choices and Sex Selection in Asia: Analysis and Policy | last=Ebenstein | first=Avraham Y. | date=February 2007 |  url=http://www.demog.berkeley.edu/~ebenstei/Ebenstein_Avraham_JM1.pdf | accessdate=19 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Das Gupta pointed out that the female-male ratio changed in relation to average household income in a way that was consistent with Sen's hypothesis but not Oster's. In particular, lower household income eventually leads to a higher boy/girl ratio. Furthermore, Das Gupta documented that the gender birth order was significantly different conditional on the sex of the first child.

If the first child was male, then the sex of the subsequent children tended to follow the regular, biologically determined sex pattern (boys born with probability 0.512, girls born with probability 0.488). However, if the first child was female, the subsequent children had a much higher probability of being male, indicating that conscious parental choice was involved in determining the sex of the child. Neither of these phenomena can be explained by the prevalence of hepatitis B.

They are, however, consistent with Sen's contention that it is purposeful human action – in the form of selective abortion and perhaps even [[infanticide]] and female infant neglect – that is the cause of the skewed gender ratio.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Oster | first=Emily | authorlink=Emily Oster | title=Explaining Asia's "Missing Women": A New Look at the Data &amp;ndash; Comment | journal=Population and Development Review | date=September 2005 | volume=31 | issue=3 | pages=529–535 | url=http://home.uchicago.edu/~eoster/dasgupta.pdf | accessdate=19 May 2009 | doi=10.1111/j.1728-4457.2005.00082.x | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080830045057/http://home.uchicago.edu/~eoster/dasgupta.pdf | archivedate=30 August 2008 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Oster's theory refuted====
Part of the difficulty in discerning between the two competing hypotheses was the fact that while the link between Hepatitis B and a higher likelihood of male birth had been documented, there was little information available on the strength of this link and how it varied by which of the parents were the carriers. Furthermore, most prior medical studies did not use a sufficiently high number of observations to convincingly estimate the magnitude of the relationship.

However, in a 2008 study published in the ''[[American Economic Review]]'', Lin and Luoh utilized data on almost 3 million births in [[Taiwan]] over a long period of time and found that the effect of maternal Hepatitis B infection on the probability of male birth was very small, about one quarter of one percent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Lin | first=Ming-Jen | first2=Ming-Ching | last2=Luoh | year=2008 | title=Can Hepatitis B Mothers Account for the Number of Missing Women? Evidence from Three Million Newborns in Taiwan | journal=American Economic Review | volume=98 | issue=5 | pages=2259&amp;ndash;73 | doi=10.1257/aer.98.5.2259| citeseerx=10.1.1.704.7977 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This meant that the rates of Hepatitis B infection among mothers could not account for the vast majority of missing women.

The remaining possibility was that it was the infection among fathers that could lead to a skewed birth ratio. However, Oster, together with Chen, Yu and Lin, in a follow up study to Lin and Luoh examined a data set of 67,000 births (15% of whom were Hepatitis B carriers) and found no effect of infection on birth ratio for either the mothers or fathers. As a result, Oster retracted her earlier hypothesis.&lt;ref name="revision"&gt;{{cite web | last=Oster | first=Emily | authorlink=Emily Oster | last2=Chen | first2=Gang | last3=Yu | first3=Xinsen | last4=Lin | first4=Wenyao | title=Hepatitis B Does Not Explain Male-Biased Sex Ratios in China | year=2008 | url=http://home.uchicago.edu/~eoster/hbvnotecon.pdf | accessdate=19 May 2009 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100118130724/http://home.uchicago.edu/~eoster/hbvnotecon.pdf | archivedate=18 January 2010 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other diseases===
In a 2008 study, Anderson and Ray claim that other diseases may explain the "excess female mortality" across Asia and sub-Saharan Africa.&lt;ref name="Diseases"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Anderson|first=Siwan|author2=Debraj Ray|title=Missing women: age and disease.|journal=The Review of Economic Studies|year=2010|volume=77|series=4|pages=1262–1300|url=http://restud.oxfordjournals.org/content/77/4/1262.short|issue=4|doi=10.1111/j.1467-937x.2010.00609.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; By comparing relative death rates of females to males in developed countries to the country in question, Anderson and Ray find that 37 to 45% of the missing women in China can be traced to pre-birth and infancy stage termination factors, whereas only around 11% of India's missing women were caused by similar factors, pointing to the fact that the loss is spread across different ages. They find that by and large, the main cause for female deaths in India is [[cardiovascular disease]]. "Injuries" is the number two cause of female deaths in India. Both of these causes are far greater than maternal mortality and [[abortion]] of fetuses, though "Injuries" may be directly related to gender discrimination.&lt;ref name="Diseases"/&gt;

Their findings for China also attribute missing women of older ages to cardiovascular and other non-communicable diseases, accounting for a large portion of excess female deaths. However, the largest bracket of missing women is in the 0-4 age group, suggesting discrimination factors at work in accordance to Sen's original theories.&lt;ref name="Diseases"/&gt;

In sub-Saharan Africa, in contrast to Sen's contention and average statistics, Anderson and Ray find a large number of women are missing.&lt;ref name="Sen update"/&gt; Sen used the sex ratio of 1.022 for sub-Saharan Africa in work done in 2001, to avoid comparing advanced countries to developing ones. Just as Sen believed, in their study they find no evidence to impute the missing women to birth discrimination such as sex-selective abortions or neglect. To account for the high number of young women missing they discovered that [[HIV/AIDS]] was the main cause, surpassing [[malaria]] and maternal mortality.  Anderson and Ray estimated an annual excess female death rate 600,000 due to HIV/AIDS alone. The age groups with the highest numbers of missing women were the 20- to 24- and 25- to 29-year-old ranges. The high prevalence of HIV/AIDS seems to suggest, according to Anderson and Ray, an imbalance in women's access to healthcare as well as different attitudes about sexual and cultural norms.&lt;ref name="Diseases"/&gt;

In an article in 2008, Eileen Stillwaggon, showed that higher rates of HIV/AIDS are the consequence of deep-rooted gender inequalities in sub-Saharan Africa.  In countries where women cannot own property they are in a more precarious fall-back position, having less [[bargaining power]] to "insist on safe sex without risking abandonment" by their husbands.&lt;ref name="Stillwaggon"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Stillwaggon|first=Eileen|title=Race, sex, and the neglected risks for women and girls in sub-Saharan Africa.|journal=Feminist Economics|date=2008|volume=14|issue=4|series=4|pages=67–86|doi=10.1080/13545700802262923}}&lt;/ref&gt;  She claims that a person's vulnerability to HIV depends on their overall health, and as misinformed practices, such as the belief that having sex with a female virgin will cure a male of AIDS, dry sex, and household activities that expose women to diseases contribute to weakening women's immune systems which leads to higher HIV mortality rates. Stillwaggon argues for increased focus on sanitation and nutrition rather than just [[abstinence]] or safe sex.  As women become healthier the chances of an infected female transmitting HIV to a male partner decline significantly.&lt;ref name="Stillwaggon"/&gt;

===Natural causes to high or low human sex ratio===
Other scholars question the assumed normal sex ratio, and point to a wealth of historical and geographical data that suggest sex ratios vary naturally over time and place, for reasons not properly understood.

* there are equal numbers of X and Y chromosomes in mammalian sperms
* X and Y stand equal chance of achieving conception
* therefore equal number of male and female zygotes are formed, and that
* therefore any variation of sex ratio at birth is due to sex selection between conception and birth.

James cautions that available scientific evidence stands against the above assumptions and conclusions. He reports that there is an excess of males at birth in almost all human populations, and the natural sex ratio at birth is usually between 102 and 108. However the ratio may deviate significantly from this range for natural reasons such as early marriage and fertility, teenage mothers, average maternal age at birth, paternal age, age gap between father and mother, late births, ethnicity, social and economic stress, warfare, environmental and hormonal effects.&lt;ref name=James-JournalofEndocrinology/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;JAN GRAFFELMAN and ROLF F.

James's hypothesis is supported by historical birth sex ratio data before technologies for ultrasonographic sex-screening were discovered and commercialized in the 1960s and 1970s, as well by reversed sex ratios currently observed in Africa. Michel Garenne reports that many African nations have, over decades, witnessed birth sex ratios below 100, that is more girls are born than boys.&lt;ref&gt;Michel Garenne, Southern African Journal of Demography, Vol. 9, No. 1 (June 2004), pp. 91-96&lt;/ref&gt; [[Angola]], [[Botswana]] and [[Namibia]] have reported birth sex ratios between 94 and 99, which is quite different than the presumed 104 to 106 as natural human birth sex ratio.&lt;ref&gt;Michel Garenne, Southern African Journal of Demography, Vol. 9, No. 1 (June 2004), page 95&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Graunt]] noted that in London over a 35-year period in the 17th century (1628–1662),&lt;ref&gt;RB Campbell, [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11512687 John Graunt, John Arbuthnott, and the human sex ratio], Hum Biol. 2001 Aug;73(4):605-610&lt;/ref&gt; the birth sex ratio was 1.07; while Korea's historical records suggest a birth sex ratio of 1.13, based on 5 million births, in 1920s over a 10-year period.&lt;ref&gt;Ciocco, A. (1938), Variations in the ratio at birth in USA, Human Biology, 10:36–64&lt;/ref&gt;

===Female abduction and sale===
Evidence has shown that number of missing women may be due to other reasons than sex selective abortions or female migrant work.  Specifically, female babies, girls and women have been preyed upon by [[Human trafficking|human traffickers]].  In China families are less willing to sell male babies even though they carry a higher price in the trade.  Females born exceeding the one-child policy can be sold to wealthier families while the parents claim selling their female baby is better than other alternatives.&lt;ref name="N1"&gt;{{cite book|last=Pearson|first=Veronica|title="A Broken Compact." China's Deep Reform: Domestic Politics in Transition|date=2006|page=431}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Overseas adoption services for Chinese children have been involved in baby trafficking to reap the profits of donations from foreign adopters.&lt;ref name="N3"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Meier|first=Patricia J.|author2=Xiaole Zhang|title=Sold into adoption: the Hunan baby trafficking scandal exposes vulnerabilities in Chinese adoptions to the United States|journal=Cumberland Law Review|date=2008|volume=39|issue=87|url=http://www.childtrafficking.com/Docs/meier_08_sold_adoption_1009.pdf|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140413145141/http://www.childtrafficking.com/Docs/meier_08_sold_adoption_1009.pdf|archivedate=2014-04-13|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  One study notes that between 2002 and 2005 approximately 1000 trafficked babies were placed with adopting parents, each baby costing $3000.&lt;ref name="N2"&gt;{{cite news|last=Goodman|first=Peter S.|title=Stealing Babies for Adoption: With U.S. Couples Eager to Adopt, Some Infants Are Abducted and Sold in China|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/03/11/AR2006031100942.html|accessdate=4/11/14|newspaper=Washington Post|date=Mar 12, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;  To keep up supply of orphans for adoption, orphanages and retirement homes hire women as baby traffickers.&lt;ref name="N2"/&gt;

Overall, underreporting and trafficking may be too small to account for the staggering numbers of missing women across south-eastern Asia and sub-Saharan Africa though they may be related in causal factors.{{synthesis inline|date=October 2015}}

==Consequences==
Some research has also noted that in the mid-1990s a reverse began in the observed trends in the regions of Asia where originally the male/female ratios were high. In line with the studies of Das Gupta described above, as income increases the bias in the sex ratio towards boys decreases.

===Societal health===
Female discrimination and neglect is not just affecting girls and women.  Sen described the effects of female [[malnutrition]] and other forms of discrimination on men's health.&lt;ref name="Sen update"/&gt;  As pregnant women suffer from nutritional neglect the fetus suffers, leading to [[low birth weight]] for male as well as female babies.  Medical studies have found a close relationship to [[low birth weight]] and [[cardiovascular diseases]] at later stages in life.&lt;ref name="Sen update"/&gt; While underweight female babies are at risk for continuing undernourishment, ironically, Sen points out that even decades after birth, "men suffer disproportionately more from cardiovascular diseases."&lt;ref name="Sen update"/&gt;

With high per capita income growth in many parts of India and China during the late 1990s and the 2000s, male/female ratios have begun shifting towards "normal" levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Dyson | first=Tim | year=2001 | title=The Preliminary Demography of the 2001 Census of India | journal=Population and Development Review | volume=27 | issue=2 | pages=341&amp;ndash;356 | doi=10.1111/j.1728-4457.2001.00341.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Klasen | first=Stephan | first2=Claudia | last2=Wink | year=2002 | title=A Turning Point in Gender Bias in Mortality? an update on the number of missing women | journal=Population and Development Review | volume=28 | issue=2 | pages=285&amp;ndash;312 | doi=10.1111/j.1728-4457.2002.00285.x| citeseerx=10.1.1.594.9344 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, for India and China, this appears to be due to a fall in adult female mortality rates, relative to male adults, rather than a change in the sex ratio among children and newborns.

In general, these conditions amount to widespread deprivations of women across East and South Asia.  According to Nussbaum's Capabilities Approach, as millions of females are discriminated against they are being deprived of their essential capabilities to such as life, bodily health and bodily integrity, among others. According this framework, policy should focus on increasing women's capabilities even at the cost of changing long held traditions.&lt;ref name=nussbaum&gt;{{cite journal|last=Nussbaum|first=Martha|title=Women and equality: the capabilities approach.|journal=International Labour Review|year=1999|volume=138|issue=3|series=3|pages=227–245|doi=10.1111/j.1564-913X.1999.tb00386.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Missing brides===
Some have speculated that the disparity in the sex ratio may affect the [[marriage market]] in such a way that may turn the tide of missing women.&lt;ref name=brides&gt;{{cite journal|last=d'Albis|first=Hippolyte|author2=David De La Croix|title=Missing daughters, missing brides?.|journal=Economics Letters|year=2012|volume=116|issue=3|series=3|pages=358–360|doi=10.1016/j.econlet.2012.03.032|hdl=2078/109963}}&lt;/ref&gt;   [[David de la Croix|David De La Croix]] and Hippolyte d'Albis developed the Missing Bride Index and a mathematical model showing that over time, as rich and affluent families continue to abort female babies and raise male children and as less wealthy families have girls, more males will be more affluent and the prospects for women to marry will increase.  They predict that prospects for girls in the marriage market may become so auspicious that bearing female children may be seen as a positive rather than a negative.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kaur|first=Ravinder|title=Missing women and brides from faraway: Social consequences of the skewed sex ratio in India.|journal=AAS (Austrian Academy of Sciences) Working Papers in Social Anthropology, Approbated|year=2008|pages=1–13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Excess men===
Since the advent of sex-selective abortions via [[ultrasound]] and other medical procedures in the 1980s, the gender discriminations that have caused the “missing women” have simultaneously produced cohorts of excess men.  Many speculated that this group of excess men would cause social disturbances such as crime and abnormal sexual behaviors without the opportunity to marry.  In a 2011 study, Hesketh found [[crime]] rates to not differ significantly from areas with known higher populations of excess men.  She found that instead of being prone to aggression these men are more likely to feel outcast and suffer from feelings of failure, loneliness and associated psychological problems.&lt;ref name=Hesketh&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hesketh|first=Therese|title=Selecting sex: The effect of preferring sons.|journal=Early Human Development|date=2011|volume=87|issue=11|pages=759–761|doi=10.1016/j.earlhumdev.2011.08.016|pmid=21920680}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others are using [[emigration]] to other countries like the U.S or Russia as a solution.&lt;ref name="Hesketh"/&gt;

To combat runaway sex-ratio disparity, Hesketh recommends government policy to intervene by making sex selective abortion illegal and promoting awareness to fight son preference paradigms.&lt;ref name=Hesketh /&gt;

===Other effects===
A different development occurred in [[South Korea]] which in the early 1990s had one of the highest male to female ratios in the world. By 2007 however, South Korea, had a male to female ratio comparable to that found in Western Europe, the US and [[sub-Saharan Africa]].

This development characterized both adult ratios as well as the ratios among new births. According to Chung and Das Gupta rapid economic growth and development in South Korea has led to a sweeping change in social attitudes and reduced the preference for sons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi=10.1111/j.1728-4457.2007.00196.x | last=Chung | first=Woojin | first2=Monica | last2=Das Gupta | year=2007 | title=The Decline of Son Preference in South Korea: the roles of development and public policy | journal=Population and Development Review | volume=33 |issue=4 | pages=757&amp;ndash;783}}&lt;/ref&gt; Das Gupta, Chung, and Shuzhuo conclude that it is possible that China and India will experience a similar reversal in trend towards normal sex ratio in the near future if their rapid economic development, combined with policies that seek to promote gender equality, continue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Das Gupta |first=Monica |authorlink= |author2=Chung, Woojin |author3=Shuzhuo, Li  |date=February 2009 |title=Is There an Incipient Turnaround in Asia's 'Missing Girls' Phenomenon? |journal=World Bank Policy Research Working Paper |volume=4846 |issue= |pages= |ssrn=1354952 |quote= |doi=10.1596/1813-9450-4846|series=Policy Research Working Papers }}&lt;/ref&gt; This reversal has been interpreted as the latest phase of a more complex cycle called the "sex ratio transition".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Guilmoto |first=Christophe Z.|year=2009 |title=The Sex Ratio Transition in Asia |journal=CEPED Working Paper |volume=5 |issue= |pages= |url=http://www.ceped.org/biblio/files/guilmoto/2009/95_Guilmoto2009.pdf |accessdate=2009-11-19 |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Policy solutions ==
Policy solutions are complicated by the fact that patterns of "missing women" are not uniform in all parts of developing nations. Studies find large variations between missing women.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://www.nybooks.com/articles/1990/12/20/more-than-100-million-women-are-missing/|title=More Than 100 Million Women Are Missing|last=Sen|first=Amartya|date=20 December 1990|journal=The New York Review of Books|access-date=21 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, there is an "excess" of women in Sub-Saharan Africa rather than deficit: the ratio of women to men is 1.02.&lt;ref name="Sen" /&gt; On the other hand, there are disproportionately large numbers of missing women in India and China.&lt;ref name="Sen"/&gt; Researchers argue that the prevalence of "missing women" is often intertwined with a society's culture and history, and as a result, it is difficult to create broad policy solutions. For example, Jafri argues that the relegation of women to an inferior position in Muslim society perpetuates the "missing women" issue.&lt;ref&gt;Jafri, S. M. (2007). Missing Women: Trends, Protraction and Economic Development in Muslim Countries. Pakistan Horizon, 60(4), 1-25.&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, there is evidence suggesting that even in the sixteenth through nineteenth centuries, Western European countries did not face sex ratios as skewed as the ones we see today in various developing countries.&lt;ref&gt;Lynch, K. A. (2011). Why weren't (many) European women ‘missing’?. The History of the Family,16(3), 250-266.&lt;/ref&gt; Even between India and Bangladesh, two countries with similar levels of education and gender disparity today, there are differences in missing women: the same measures to improve female welfare in Bangladesh do much worse in India.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kabeer | first1 = N. | last2 = Huq | first2 = L. | last3 = Mahmud | first3 = S. | year = 2014 | title = Diverging stories of "missing women" in South Asia: Is son preference weakening in Bangladesh? | url = | journal = Feminist Economics | volume = 20 | issue = 4| pages = 138–163 | doi=10.1080/13545701.2013.857423}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kabeer argues that this is the case because India is stratified by social caste, while Bangladesh is more homogenous; as a result, progressive ideas such as improving the welfare of women can more easily disseminate in Bangladesh.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

Regardless of cultural variation, Sen argues that in general, policies aimed to address education and women's employment opportunities outside the home may improve the missing women situation and fight the stigma attached to female children.&lt;ref name="Sen 1992 587"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sen|first=Amartya|year=1992|title=Missing Women|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1881324/pdf/bmj00063-0009.pdf|journal=BMJ: British Medical Journal|volume=304|issue=6827|pages=587–8|pmc=1881324|pmid=1559085|doi=10.1136/bmj.304.6827.587}}&lt;/ref&gt; Much research has been conducted in this area.

===Education===
Findings from the Indian Census in 2001 suggest that women's increased educational attainment was associated with the rise in the female-to-male sex ratio of India.&lt;ref name="Sen update"/&gt; Similarly, Dito's research in Ethiopia shows that in families where females are highly educated, have many brothers, and are close in age to their husbands, women tend to be more well-off, leading to lower counts of missing women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Dito | first1 = B. B. | year = 2015 | title = Women's Intrahousehold Decision-Making Power and Their Health Status: Evidence from Rural Ethiopia | url = | journal = Feminist Economics | volume = 21 | issue = 3| pages = 168–190 | doi=10.1080/13545701.2015.1007073}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, in some countries, increasing access to education has helped

On the other hand, later studies of India showed that increasing education may actually worsen the missing women phenomenon.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Increasing female education may actually increase the rate of sex-selective abortion and thus increase the male-to-female sex ratio, as more well-educated female adults realize that opportunities in their society for their male children are much better than opportunities for their female children.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; In addition, female children are seen as a cost on the family because of their lack of employment opportunities, the paying of dowry, and their limited ability to own property.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Mukherjee argues that this is further exacerbated by the fact that despite higher female education in India, there is a scarcity of jobs for highly educated women, suggesting that even with higher education, women's place in society does not expand much.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Mukherjee | first1 = S. S. | year = 2013 | title = Women's empowerment and gender bias in the birth and survival of girls in urban India | url = | journal = Feminist Economics | volume = 19 | issue = 1| pages = 1–28 | doi=10.1080/13545701.2012.752312}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Employment opportunities===
Sen argues that a woman's opportunity to participate in the labor force affords her more bargaining power within the home. In Sub-Saharan Africa, where there are fewer missing women, a woman is generally able to earn income from outside the home, increasing her contributions to her household and contributing to a different overall view of the value of women compared to that of Southeast and East Asia.&lt;ref name="Sen" /&gt; However, Sen's contention about gainful work outside the home has led to some debates. Berik and Bilginsoy researched Sen's premise that improved women's economic opportunities outside of the home will diminish the disparity in the sex ratio in Turkey. They found that as women participated more in the work force and maintained their unpaid labor the sex ratio disparity grew, contrary to Sen's original prediction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Berik|first=Günseli|year=2000|title=Type of work matters: women's labor force participation and the child sex ratio in Turkey.|url=http://ac.els-cdn.com/S0305750X99001643/1-s2.0-S0305750X99001643-main.pdf?_tid=def80c20-b55c-11e3-80dc-00000aab0f26&amp;acdnat=1395889803_3baae17ace5d3ad69903f49b1a6a904c|journal=World Development|series=5|volume=28|issue=5|pages=861–878|doi=10.1016/s0305-750x(99)00164-3|author2=Cihan Bilginsoy}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, Sen notes that in Narsapur, India, lace-makers have less bargaining power from their labor because lace-making is done in the home and perceived as supplementary, rather than gainful, labor. However, women making cigarettes in Allahabad, India, were viewed as having gainful labor, which helped boost the community's view of women.&lt;ref name="Model" /&gt; As Sen argues, only gainful labor is useful for dismantling the phenomenon of missing women.

Qian adds to these analyses by noting that a rise in female income is not enough to solve the missing women problem; rather, the rise in female income must be relative to male income. In her 2008 study, Qian shows that when females in China earn a 10% increase in household income while male income is held constant, male births fall by 1.2 percentage points. This female-specific wage boost also increases parents' investment in female children, with female children gaining 0.25 years more education. As a result, an increase in female-specific economic productivity helped boost both the survival of and investment in female children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Qian | first1 = N | year = 2008 | title = Missing women and the price of tea in China: The effect of sex-specific earnings on sex imbalance | url = | journal = The Quarterly Journal of Economics | volume = 123 | issue = 3| pages = 1251–1285 | doi=10.1162/qjec.2008.123.3.1251}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, if women become more economically productive themselves, it may alter the view of female children as economically unproductive as well. This may increase girls' chances of surviving to birth and receiving the care and attention during childhood that they need.&lt;ref name="Sen 1992 587" /&gt;

===International organizations and currently implemented policies===
Despite the variations in studies on which policies help decrease the number of missing women, several international organizations and independent countries have taken measures to attempt to help the problem. The OECD includes "missing women" as a measure under the Son preference parameter of its Social Inclusion and Gender Index, bringing awareness to it as an issue.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;“Social Institutions &amp; Gender Index”. OECD Development Center. http://www.genderindex.org/data&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;Boris Branisa, Stephan Klasen, Maria Ziegler, Denis Drechsler, and Johannes Jütting (2013): The institutional basis of gender inequality: the Social Institutions and Gender Index (SIGI). Feminist Economics, Published online: 11 Dec 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, the 1989 Convention on the Rights of the Child noted the importance of children in measuring a society's level of equality, while the Fourth UN Conference for Women in 1995 developed the [[Beijing Platform for Action|Beijing platform]], which recognized the rights of the female child.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;Croll, E. J. (2001). Amartya Sen's 100 Million Missing Women. Oxford Development Studies,29(3), 225-244.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, due to international pressure, India and China have both banned the use of ultrasounds for the purpose of sex-selective abortions.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

In 2014, Kabeer, Huq, and Mahmud used a comparison of India and Bangladesh to argue that cultural dissemination of progressive ideas boosting the place of women in society is key for solving the problem of missing women.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; They show that NGOs in Bangladesh, which are present in over seventy percent of Bangladeshi villages, can be a helpful tool to mobilize change and culture.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; On the other hand, they argue that culturally instituted inequities such as India's caste system, which stratifies its society, prevent the spread of more progressive ideas, and as a result, cause a higher prevalence of missing women.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

'''''Muselmann''''' (pl. '''''Muselmänner''''', the [[German language|German]] version of [[Musulman]], meaning [[Muslim people|Muslim]]) was a slang term used among captives of [[World War II]] [[Nazi concentration camp]]s to refer to those suffering from a combination of [[starvation]] (known also as "hunger disease") and exhaustion and who were resigned to their impending death.&lt;ref name= levi/&gt;&lt;ref name="Czech1996"&gt;{{cite book|author=Danuta Czech|title=Auschwitz: Nazi Death Camp|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Je1mAAAAMAAJ|year=1996|publisher=Auschwitz-Birkenau State Museum|isbn=978-83-85047-56-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Muselmann prisoners exhibited severe [[emaciation]] and physical weakness, an [[apathy|apathetic]] listlessness regarding their own fate, and unresponsiveness to their surroundings owing to the barbaric treatment by the Nazis and [[Kapo (concentration camp)|prisoner functionaries]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wsg-hist.uni-linz.ac.at/auschwitz/html/Muselmann.html Muselmann definition] [[Johannes Kepler University of Linz]], official website. Insitut für Sozial und Wirtschaftsgeschichte. Retrieved November 30, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Buchenwald-J-Rouard-12.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[Buchenwald]] inmates, 16 April 1945 when camp was liberated]]
Some scholars argue that the term possibly comes from the Muselmann's inability to stand for any time due to the loss of leg muscle, thus spending much of the time in a prone position, recalling the position of the [[Musulman]] (Muslim) during prayers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www1.yadvashem.org/odot_pdf/Microsoft%20Word%20-%206474.pdf Muselmann definition] (PDF) [[Yad Vashem]], official website. Shoah Resource Center, The International School for Holocaust Studies. Retrieved November 30, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; It has also been suggested by Giorgio Agamben that the term hails from the Islamic fatalism which characterizes Sunnite orthodoxy, i.e. the idea that there are no such things as causality but that God performs every occurrence in the world, meaning that everything including men simply undergoes the workings of God and does not act on its own. Muselmann would then be the darkest interpretation of this fatalism. 

==Usage of the term in literature==
The American psychologist [[David P. Boder]] assisted in identifying the term ''musselman'' when in 1946 he conducted interviews with camp survivors in Europe. He asked them to describe, spell and pronounce the word for camp inmates so emaciated that they had lost the will to live.&lt;ref name="Ritchie2011"&gt;{{cite book |author=Ritchie, Donald A. |title=The Oxford Handbook of Oral History |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gNkL6T8Zx4cC&amp;pg=PA245 |year=2011 |publisher=Oxford University Press, USA |isbn=978-0-19-533955-0 |pages=245&amp;nbsp;ff}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Rosen2010"&gt;{{cite book |author=Alan Rosen|title=The Wonder of Their Voices: The 1946 Holocaust Interviews of David Boder |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BvJ6UnmktUAC&amp;pg=PA306|date=18 October 2010 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-978076-1 |pages=306&amp;nbsp;ff}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Primo Levi]] tried to explain the term (he also uses ''Musselman''), in a footnote of ''[[If This Is a Man]]'', his autobiographical account of his time in [[Auschwitz]]:&lt;ref name=levi&gt;{{cite book |author=Levi, Primo |title=[[If This Is a Man]] |chapter=The Truce |publisher=Abacus |year=1987 |ISBN=0349100136 |page=94}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quote|text=This word ‘Muselmann’, I do not know why, was used by the old ones of the camp to describe the weak, the inept, those doomed to selection.|sign=[[Primo Levi]]|source=''[[If This Is a Man]]'', chapter "The Drowned and the Saved".}}

The [[psychology|psychologist]] and [[Auschwitz]] survivor [[Viktor Frankl]], in his book ''[[Man's Search for Meaning]]'', provides the example of a prisoner who decides to use up his last cigarettes (used as currency in the concentration camps) in the evening because he is convinced he won't survive the ''[[Appellplatz|Appell]]'' (roll call assembly) the next morning; his fellow captives derided him as a ''Muselmann''.

Italian philosopher [[Giorgio Agamben]] defined his key examples of 'bare life', the Muselmann and the patient in an overcoma, in relation to their passivity and inertia. The Muselmann was for him "a being from whom humiliation, horror and fear had so taken away all consciousness and personality as to make him absolutely apathetic", "[m]ute and absolutely alone ... without memory and without grief."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Elliott |first1=Jane |title=Suffering Agency: Imagining neoliberal personhood in North America and Britain |journal=Social Text |date=Summer 2013 |issue=31 |page=86}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Canadian Jewish author [[Eli Pfefferkorn]] published a novel in 2011 with title ''The Müselmann at the Water Cooler''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Pfefferkorn |first=Eli |date=2011 |title=The Müselmann at the Water Cooler |url=https://www.amazon.ca/M%C3%BCselmann-at-Water-Cooler/dp/1936235668 |publisher=Academic Studies Press |isbn=978-1936235667}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin and alternative slang terms==

The term spread from [[Auschwitz-Birkenau]] to other concentration camps. Its equivalent in the [[Majdanek concentration camp]] was ''Gamel'' (derived from German ''gammeln'' - colloquial for "rotting") and in the [[Stutthof concentration camp]], ''Krypel'' (derived from German ''Krüppel'', "cripple"). When prisoners reached this emaciated condition, they were selected by camp doctors and murdered by gas, bullet or various other methods.

==Criticism==
Critics of the word Muselmann often proclaim that it is rooted in [[Islamophobia]].

The word Muselmann frequents texts which use the term in a demeaning manner. For example, in his book ''Man's Search for Meaning'' author Victor Frankl mentions the frequent use of the word "Musselman" in the concentration camps of the Nazi regime. In ''Man's Search for Meaning'', Frankl berates the attitudes of those who fit his definition of the word Musselman by associating the word with those who are unable to fight the oppressive tactics utilized by the Nazis.

[[File:Noel Coward Allan warren edit 1.jpg|thumb|Coward in 1972]]
'''Sir Noël Peirce&lt;!--YES, it is spelled PEIRCE--&gt; Coward''' (16 December 1899{{snd}}26 March 1973) was an English playwright, composer, director, actor and singer, known for his wit, flamboyance, and what ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine called "a sense of personal style, a combination of cheek and chic, pose and poise".&lt;ref name=Time1969&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,941819-2,00.html "Noel Coward at 70",] ''Time'', 26 December 1969, accessed 2 May 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

Coward attended a dance academy in London as a child, making his professional stage début at the age of eleven. As a teenager he was introduced into the high society in which most of his plays would be set. Coward achieved enduring success as a playwright, publishing more than 50 plays from his teens onwards. Many of his works, such as ''[[Hay Fever (play)|Hay Fever]]'', ''[[Private Lives]]'', ''[[Design for Living]]'', ''[[Present Laughter]]'' and ''[[Blithe Spirit (play)|Blithe Spirit]]'', have remained in the regular theatre repertoire. He composed hundreds of songs, in addition to well over a dozen musical theatre works (including the operetta ''[[Bitter Sweet]]'' and comic [[revue]]s), screenplays, poetry, several volumes of short stories, the novel ''Pomp and Circumstance'', and a three-volume autobiography. Coward's stage and film acting and directing career spanned six decades, during which he starred in many of his own works.

At the outbreak of the Second World War Coward volunteered for war work, running the British propaganda office in Paris. He also worked with the Secret Service, seeking to use his influence to persuade the American public and government to help Britain. Coward won an [[Academy Honorary Award]] in 1943 for his naval film drama, ''[[In Which We Serve]]'', and was knighted in 1969. In the 1950s he achieved fresh success as a cabaret performer, performing his own songs, such as "[[Mad Dogs and Englishmen (song)|Mad Dogs and Englishmen]]", "[[London Pride (song)|London Pride]]" and "[[I Went to a Marvellous Party]]".

Coward's plays and songs achieved new popularity in the 1960s and 1970s, and his work and style continue to influence popular culture. He did not publicly acknowledge his homosexuality, but it was discussed candidly after his death by biographers including [[Graham Payn]], his long-time partner, and in Coward's diaries and letters, published posthumously. The former Albery Theatre (originally the New Theatre) in London was renamed the [[Noël Coward Theatre]] in his honour in 2006.

== Biography ==

=== Early years ===
Coward was born in 1899 in [[Teddington]], [[Middlesex]], a south-western suburb of London. His parents were Arthur Sabin Coward (1856{{ndash}}1937), a piano salesman, and Violet Agnes Coward (1863{{ndash}}1954), daughter of [[s:A Naval Biographical Dictionary/Veitch, Henry Gordon|Henry Gordon Veitch]], a captain and surveyor in the [[Royal Navy]].&lt;ref&gt;Morley, p. 2&lt;/ref&gt; Violet's cousin, Rachel Veitch, was mother of Field-Marshal [[Douglas Haig, 1st Earl Haig|Douglas Haig]].&lt;ref&gt;Hoare, p. 2&lt;/ref&gt; Noël Coward was the second of their three sons, the eldest of whom had died in 1898 at the age of six.&lt;ref&gt;Morley, p. 3&lt;/ref&gt; Coward's father lacked ambition and industry, and family finances were often poor.&lt;ref&gt;Morley, pp. 4, 8 and 67&lt;/ref&gt; Coward was bitten by the performing bug early and appeared in amateur concerts by the age of seven. He attended the [[Chapel Royal]] Choir School as a young child. He had little formal schooling but was a voracious reader.&lt;ref name=Kenrick1&gt;[[John Kenrick (theatre writer)|Kenrick, John]]. [http://www.musicals101.com/noelbio.htm "Noel Coward – Biographical Sketch"], Coward 101 at ''Musicals 101: The Cyber Encyclopedia of Musical Theatre, TV and Film'', 2000, accessed 9 March 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

Encouraged by his ambitious mother, who sent him to a dance academy in London,&lt;ref&gt;Hoare, p. 19&lt;/ref&gt; Coward's first professional engagement was in January 1911 as Prince Mussel in the children's play ''The Goldfish''.&lt;ref&gt;"The Little Theatre", ''The Times'', 28 January 1911, p. 12&lt;/ref&gt; In ''Present Indicative'', his first volume of memoirs, Coward wrote:
{{quote|One day{{space}}... a little advertisement appeared in the ''[[Daily Mirror]]''.... It stated that a talented boy of attractive appearance was required by a Miss Lila Field to appear in her production of an all-children fairy play: ''The Goldfish.'' This seemed to dispose of all argument. I was a talented boy, God knows, and, when washed and smarmed down a bit, passably attractive. There appeared to be no earthly reason why Miss Lila Field shouldn't jump at me, and we both believed that she would be a fool indeed to miss such a magnificent opportunity.&lt;ref&gt;Coward (''Present Indicative''), pp. 21–22&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[File:coward Hawtrey 1911.jpg|left|thumb|Coward ''(left)'' with [[Lydia Bilbrook]] ''(centre)'' and [[Charles Hawtrey (actor born 1858)|Charles Hawtrey]], 1911]]
The leading actor-manager [[Charles Hawtrey (actor born 1858)|Charles Hawtrey]], whom the young Coward idolised and from whom he learned a great deal about the theatre, cast him in the children's play ''[[Where the Rainbow Ends]]''. Coward played in the piece in 1911 and 1912 at the [[Garrick Theatre]] in London's [[West End theatre|West End]].&lt;ref&gt;Hoare, pp. 23–26&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=times1912&gt;"Garrick Theatre", ''The Times'', 12 December 1912, p. 8&lt;/ref&gt; In 1912 Coward also appeared at the [[Savoy Theatre]] in ''An Autumn Idyll'' (as a dancer in the ballet) and at the [[London Coliseum]] in ''A Little Fowl Play'', by Harold Owen, in which Hawtrey starred.&lt;ref&gt;"The Savoy Theatre", ''The Times'', 26 June 1912, p. 10; "The Coliseum", 29 October 1912, p. 8; and "Varieties etc", 18 November 1912, p. 1&lt;/ref&gt; [[Italia Conti Academy|Italia Conti]] engaged Coward to appear at the [[Liverpool Playhouse|Liverpool Repertory Theatre]] in 1913, and in the same year he was cast as the [[Lost Boys (Peter Pan)|Lost Boy]] Slightly in ''[[Peter and Wendy|Peter Pan]]''.&lt;ref&gt;"The Cult of Peter Pan", ''The Times'', 24 December 1913, p. 8&lt;/ref&gt; He reappeared in ''Peter Pan'' the following year, and in 1915 he was again in ''Where the Rainbow Ends''.&lt;ref&gt;"Fairies at the Garrick", ''The Times'', 28 December 1915, p. 10&lt;/ref&gt; He worked with other child actors in this period, including [[Hermione Gingold]] (whose mother threatened to turn "that naughty boy" out);&lt;ref&gt;Castle, p. 12&lt;/ref&gt; [[Fabia Drake]]; [[Esmé Wynne-Tyson|Esmé Wynne]], with whom he collaborated on his earliest plays; Alfred Willmore, later known as [[Micheál Mac Liammóir]]; and [[Gertrude Lawrence]] who, Coward wrote in his memoirs, "gave me an orange and told me a few mildly dirty stories, and I loved her from then onwards."&lt;ref name=times1912 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hoare, pp. 27, 30 and 51&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=times1916&gt;"The Happy Family", ''The Times'', 19 December 1916, p. 11&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Noel Coward in his teens.jpg|upright=.57|thumb|right|Coward in his early teens]]
In 1914, when Coward was fourteen, he became the protégé and probably the lover of [[Philip Streatfeild]], a society painter.&lt;ref&gt;Hoare, pp. 33–34&lt;/ref&gt; Streatfeild introduced him to Mrs Astley Cooper and her high society friends.{{#tag:ref|Evangeline Julia Marshall, an eccentric society hostess (1854–1944), married Clement Paston Astley Cooper, grandson of [[Astley Paston Cooper|Sir Astley Paston Cooper]], on 10 July 1877. She inherited Hambleton Hall from her brother Walter Marshall (d. 1899), and there she entertained rising talents in the artistic world, including Streatfeild, the conductor [[Malcolm Sargent]] and the writer [[C. K. Scott Moncrieff|Charles Scott Moncrieff]], as well as the young Coward.&lt;ref&gt;[[Simon Callow|Callow, Simon]].

Coward continued to perform during most of the First World War, appearing at the [[Scala Theatre|Prince of Wales's Theatre]] in 1916 in ''The Happy Family''&lt;ref name=times1916 /&gt; and on tour with [[Amy Brandon Thomas]]'s company in ''[[Charley's Aunt]]''. In 1917, he appeared in ''The Saving Grace'', a comedy produced by Hawtrey. Coward recalled in his memoirs, "My part was reasonably large and I was really quite good in it, owing to the kindness and care of Hawtrey's direction. He took endless trouble with me{{space}}... and taught me during those two short weeks many technical points of comedy acting which I use to this day."&lt;ref&gt;Coward (''Present Indicative''), p. 66&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1918, Coward was conscripted into the [[Artists Rifles]] but was assessed as unfit for active service because of a tubercular tendency, and he was discharged on health grounds after nine months.&lt;ref&gt;Lesley, pp. 41–42&lt;/ref&gt; That year he appeared in the [[D. W. Griffith|D W Griffith]] film ''[[Hearts of the World]]'' in an uncredited role. He sold short stories to several magazines to help his family financially.&lt;ref name=Kenrick1 /&gt; He also began writing plays, collaborating on the first two (''Ida Collaborates'' (1917) and ''Women and Whisky'' (1918)) with his friend Esmé Wynne.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.noelcoward.net/html/plays.html "Plays and Musicals"], The Noel Coward Society, accessed 8 February 2009&lt;/ref&gt; His first solo effort as a playwright was ''[[The Rat Trap]]'' (1918) which was eventually produced at the [[Everyman Cinema, Hampstead|Everyman Theatre]], [[Hampstead]], in October 1926.&lt;ref&gt;Thaxter, John.

=== Inter-war successes ===
In 1920, at the age of 20, Coward starred in his own play, the light comedy ''I'll Leave It to You''. After a tryout in [[Manchester]], it opened in London at the New Theatre (renamed the [[Noël Coward Theatre]] in 2006), his first full-length play in the West End.&lt;ref name=Thaxter&gt;Thaxter, John. [http://www.britishtheatreguide.info/reviews/illleave-rev.htm ''I'll Leave It To You''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110610013510/http://www.britishtheatreguide.info/reviews/illleave-rev.htm |date=10 June 2011 }}, British Theatre Guide, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; [[Neville Cardus]]'s praise in ''[[The Guardian|The Manchester Guardian]]'' was grudging.&lt;ref&gt;Cardus, Neville. "Gaiety Theatre", ''[[The Manchester Guardian]]'', 4 May 1920, p. 13&lt;/ref&gt; Notices for the London production were mixed, but encouraging.&lt;ref name=Kenrick1 /&gt; ''[[The Observer]]'' commented, "Mr Coward... has a sense of comedy, and if he can overcome a tendency to smartness, he will probably produce a good play one of these days."&lt;ref&gt;Ervine, St John. "At the Play", ''The Observer'', 25 July 1920, p. 9&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Times'', on the other hand, was enthusiastic: "It is a remarkable piece of work from so young a head – spontaneous, light, and always 'brainy'."&lt;ref&gt;"I'll Leave It to You", ''The Times'', 22 July 1920, p. 10&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Coward pestle.jpg|left|thumb|upright=.57|Coward in ''[[The Knight of the Burning Pestle]]'' in 1920]]
The play ran for a month (and was Coward's first play seen in America),&lt;ref name=Thaxter /&gt; after which Coward returned to acting in works by other writers, starring as Ralph in ''[[The Knight of the Burning Pestle]]'' in [[Birmingham Repertory Theatre|Birmingham]] and then London.&lt;ref&gt;Coward (''Present Indicative''), pp. 104–05 and 112&lt;/ref&gt; He did not enjoy the role, finding [[Francis Beaumont]] and his sometime collaborator [[John Fletcher (playwright)|John Fletcher]] "two of the dullest Elizabethan writers ever known&amp;nbsp;... I had a very, very long part, but I was very, very bad at it".&lt;ref&gt;Castle, p. 38&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, ''The Manchester Guardian'' thought that Coward got the best out of the role,&lt;ref&gt;"The Knight of the Burning Pestle", ''The Manchester Guardian'', 25 November 1920, p. 14&lt;/ref&gt; and ''The Times'' called the play "the jolliest thing in London".&lt;ref&gt;"A Jacobean Romp", ''The Times'', 25 November 1920, p. 10&lt;/ref&gt;

Coward completed a one-act satire, ''The Better Half'', about a man's relationship with two women. It had a short run at The Little Theatre, London, in 1922. The critic [[St. John Greer Ervine|St John Ervine]] wrote of the piece, "When Mr Coward has learned that tea-table chitter-chatter had better remain the prerogative of women he will write more interesting plays than he now seems likely to write."&lt;ref&gt;Ervine, St John. "New Grand Guignol Series", ''The Observer'', 4 June 1922, p. 9&lt;/ref&gt; The play was thought to be lost until a typescript was found in 2007 in the archive of the [[Lord Chamberlain's Office]], the official censor of stage plays in the UK until 1968.&lt;ref&gt;Thorpe, Vanessa. [https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2007/sep/16/theatrenews.books "Coward's long-lost satire was almost too 'daring' about women",] ''The Observer'', 16 September 2007, accessed 22 September 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1921, Coward made his first trip to America, hoping to interest producers there in his plays. Although he had little luck, he found the Broadway theatre stimulating.&lt;ref name=Kenrick1 /&gt; He absorbed its smartness and pace into his own work, which brought him his first real success as a playwright with ''The Young Idea''. The play opened in London in 1923, after a provincial tour, with Coward in one of the leading roles.&lt;ref&gt;Hoare, pp. 89–91&lt;/ref&gt; The reviews were good: "Mr Noël Coward calls his brilliant little farce a 'comedy of youth', and so it is. And youth pervaded the Savoy last night, applauding everything so boisterously that you felt, not without exhilaration, that you were in the midst of a 'rag'."&lt;ref&gt;"New Play at the Savoy", ''The Times'', 2 February 1923, p. 8&lt;/ref&gt; One critic, who noted the influence of [[George Bernard Shaw|Bernard Shaw]] on Coward's writing, thought more highly of the play than of Coward's newly found fans: "I was unfortunately wedged in the centre of a group of his more exuberant friends who greeted each of his sallies with 'That's a Noëlism!'"&lt;ref&gt;"The Young Idea", ''The Observer'', 4 February 1923, p. 11&lt;/ref&gt;{{#tag:ref|Coward himself acknowledged that Shaw's ''[[You Never Can Tell (play)|You Never Can Tell]]'' was the primary inspiration for ''The Young Idea''.&lt;ref&gt;Coward (''Present Indicative''), p. 114&lt;/ref&gt;|group= n}} The play ran in London from 1 February to 24 March 1923, after which Coward turned to [[revue]], co-writing and performing in [[André Charlot]]'s ''[[London Calling!]]''&lt;ref&gt;Coward (''Present Indicative''), pp. 112 and 150&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Lilian Braithwaite &amp; Noël Coward.jpg|right|thumb|Coward with [[Lilian Braithwaite]], his co-star in ''[[The Vortex]]'' and the mother of his close friend [[Joyce Carey]]]]
In 1924, Coward achieved his first great critical and financial success as a playwright with ''[[The Vortex]].'' The story is about a nymphomaniac socialite and her cocaine-addicted son (played by Coward). Some saw the drugs as a mask for homosexuality;&lt;ref&gt;Hoare, p. 129&lt;/ref&gt; [[Kenneth Tynan]] later described it as "a [[jeremiad]] against narcotics with dialogue that sounds today not so much stilted as high-heeled".&lt;ref name=tynan&gt;Tynan, pp. 286–88&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Vortex'' was considered shocking in its day for its depiction of sexual vanity and drug abuse among the upper classes. Its notoriety and fiery performances attracted large audiences, justifying a move from a small suburban theatre to a larger one in the West End.&lt;ref&gt;Coward (''Present Indicative''), pp. 182–85&lt;/ref&gt; Coward, still having trouble finding producers, raised the money to produce the play himself. During the run of ''The Vortex'', Coward met [[John C. Wilson|Jack Wilson]], an American stockbroker (later a director and producer), who became his business manager and lover. Wilson used his position to steal from Coward, but the playwright was in love and accepted both the larceny and Wilson's heavy drinking.&lt;ref name=Kenrick2&gt;Kenrick, John.

The success of ''The Vortex'' in both London and America caused a great demand for new Coward plays. In 1925 he premiered ''[[Fallen Angels (play)|Fallen Angels]]'', a three-act comedy that amused and shocked audiences with the spectacle of two middle-aged women slowly getting drunk while awaiting the arrival of their mutual lover.&lt;ref&gt;"Fallen Angels", ''The Manchester Guardian'', 23 April 1925, p. 12&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Hay Fever (play)|Hay Fever]]'', the first of Coward's plays to gain an enduring place in the mainstream theatrical repertoire, also appeared in 1925. It is a comedy about four egocentric members of an artistic family who casually invite acquaintances to their country house for the weekend and bemuse and enrage each other's guests. Some writers have seen elements of Coward's old mentor, Mrs Astley Cooper, and her set in the characters of the family.&lt;ref&gt;Hoare, pp. 42–43&lt;/ref&gt; By the 1970s the play was recognised as a classic, described in ''The Times'' as a "dazzling achievement; like ''[[The Importance of Being Earnest]]'', it is pure comedy with no mission but to delight, and it depends purely on the interplay of characters, not on elaborate comic machinery."&lt;ref name=timesobit /&gt; By June 1925 Coward had four shows running in the West End: ''The Vortex'', ''Fallen Angels'', ''Hay Fever'' and ''[[On with the Dance (musical)|On with the Dance]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Morley, p. 107&lt;/ref&gt; Coward was turning out numerous plays and acting in his own works and others'. Soon, his frantic pace caught up with him, and he collapsed on stage in 1926 while starring in a stage adaptation of ''[[The Constant Nymph (novel)|The Constant Nymph]]'' and had to take an extended rest, recuperating in [[Hawaii]].&lt;ref name=Kenrick2 /&gt;

Other Coward works produced in the mid-to-late 1920s included the plays ''[[Easy Virtue (play)|Easy Virtue]]'' (1926), a drama about a divorcée's clash with her snobbish in-laws; ''[[The Queen Was in the Parlour]]'', a [[Ruritanian romance]]; ''[[This Was a Man]]'' (1926), a comedy about adulterous aristocrats; ''The Marquise'' (1927), an eighteenth-century costume drama; ''Home Chat'' (1927), a comedy about a married woman's fidelity; and the revues ''On with the Dance'' (1925) and ''[[This Year of Grace]]'' (1928). None of these shows has entered the regular repertoire, but the last introduced one of Coward's best-known songs, "A Room with a View".&lt;ref name=ncsongs&gt;[http://www.noelcowardmusic.com/ncmi/appendices/appendix3.html "Appendix 3 (The Relative Popularity of Coward's Works)"], Noël Coward Music Index, accessed 29 November 2015&lt;/ref&gt; His biggest failure in this period was the play ''[[Sirocco (play)|Sirocco]]'' (1927), which concerns free love among the wealthy. It starred [[Ivor Novello]], of whom Coward said, "the two most beautiful things in the world are Ivor's profile and my mind".&lt;ref&gt;Richards, p. 56&lt;/ref&gt; Theatregoers hated the play, showing violent disapproval at the curtain calls and spitting at Coward as he left the theatre.&lt;ref name=Kenrick2 /&gt; Coward later said of this flop, "My first instinct was to leave England immediately, but this seemed too craven a move, and also too gratifying to my enemies, whose numbers had by then swollen in our minds to practically the entire population of the British Isles."&lt;ref&gt;Richards, p. 26&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1929 Coward was one of the world's highest-earning writers, with an annual income of £50,000, more than £2,000,000 in terms of 2007 values.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.measuringworth.com/ppoweruk/ "Purchasing Power of British Pounds from 1264 to 2007"], Measuring Worth website, accessed 10 March 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Coward thrived during the [[Great Depression]], writing a succession of popular hits.&lt;ref name=lahr93&gt;Lahr, p. 93&lt;/ref&gt; They ranged from large-scale spectaculars to intimate comedies. Examples of the former were the [[operetta]] ''[[Bitter Sweet]]'' (1929), about a woman who elopes with her music teacher,&lt;ref name=C&amp;N&gt;Norton, Richard C. [http://operetta-research-center.org/coward-novello/ "Coward &amp; Novello"], Operetta Research Center, 1 September 2007, accessed 29 November 2015&lt;/ref&gt; and the historical extravaganza ''[[Cavalcade (play)|Cavalcade]]'' (1931) at [[Theatre Royal, Drury Lane|Drury Lane]], about thirty years in the lives of two families, which required a huge cast, gargantuan sets and a complex hydraulic stage. Its [[Cavalcade (1933 film)|1933 film adaptation]] won the [[Academy Award]] for best picture.&lt;ref&gt;[http://awardsdatabase.oscars.org/ampas_awards/DisplayMain.jsp?curTime=1386188010849 "Best Picture – 1932/33 (6th)"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140221152803/http://awardsdatabase.oscars.org/ampas_awards/DisplayMain.jsp?curTime=1386188010849 |date=21 February 2014 }} Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, accessed 4 December 2013&lt;/ref&gt; Coward's intimate-scale hits of the period included ''[[Private Lives]]'' (1930) and ''[[Design for Living]]'' (1932). In ''Private Lives'', Coward starred alongside his most famous stage partner, Gertrude Lawrence, together with the young [[Laurence Olivier]]. It was a highlight of both Coward's and Lawrence's career, selling out in both London and New York. Coward disliked long runs, and after this he made a rule of starring in a play for no more than three months at any venue.&lt;ref name=Kenrick2 /&gt; ''Design for Living'', written for [[Alfred Lunt]] and [[Lynn Fontanne]], was so risqué, with its theme of bisexuality and a ''ménage à trois'', that Coward premiered it in New York, knowing that it would not survive the censor in London.&lt;ref&gt;Hoare, p. 249&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1933 Coward wrote, directed and co-starred with the French singer [[Yvonne Printemps]] in both London and New York productions of an operetta, ''[[Conversation Piece (musical)|Conversation Piece]]'' (1933).&lt;ref name=Kenrick2 /&gt; He next wrote, directed and co-starred with Lawrence in ''[[Tonight at 8:30]]'' (1936), a cycle of ten short plays, presented in various permutations across three evenings.{{#tag:ref|The cycle effectively comprised only nine plays: although Coward wrote ten works for the cycle, ''[[Star Chamber (play)|Star Chamber]]'' was dropped after a single performance.&lt;ref&gt;Hoare, pp. 268–70&lt;/ref&gt;|group= n}} One of these plays, ''[[Still Life (play)|Still Life]]'', was expanded into the 1945 [[David Lean]] film ''[[Brief Encounter]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Morley, pp. 226–28 and 230&lt;/ref&gt; ''Tonight at 8:30'' was followed by a musical, ''[[Operette (musical)|Operette]]'' (1938), from which the most famous number is "The Stately Homes of England", and a revue entitled ''[[Set to Music]]'' (1938, a [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] version of his 1932 London revue, ''Words and Music'').&lt;ref&gt;Morley, pp. 237 and 239&lt;/ref&gt; Coward's last pre-war plays were ''[[This Happy Breed]]'', a drama about a working-class family, and ''[[Present Laughter]]'', a comic self-caricature with an egomaniac actor as the central character. These were first performed in 1942, although they were both written in 1939.&lt;ref&gt;Lahr, pp. 32 and 93&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1929 and 1936 Coward recorded many of his best-known songs for [[The Gramophone Company|His Master's Voice]] (HMV), now reissued on CD, including the romantic "[[I'll See You Again]]" from ''Bitter Sweet'', the comic "[[Mad Dogs and Englishmen (song)|Mad Dogs and Englishmen]]" from ''Words and Music'', and "Mrs Worthington".&lt;ref&gt;Naxos CDs 8.120559 and 8.120623&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Second World War ===
With the outbreak of the Second World War Coward abandoned the theatre and sought official war work. After running the British propaganda office in Paris, where he concluded that "if the policy of His Majesty's Government is to bore the Germans to death I don't think we have time",&lt;ref&gt;Richards, p. 105&lt;/ref&gt; he worked on behalf of British intelligence.&lt;ref&gt;Koch, Stephen. [https://www.nytimes.com/2008/04/13/books/review/Koch-t.html "The Playboy was a Spy"], ''The New York Times'', 13 April 2008, accessed 4 January 2009&lt;/ref&gt; His task was to use his celebrity to influence American public and political opinion in favour of helping Britain.{{#tag:ref|[[Harold Nicolson]], speaking for the Ministry of Information, stated that Coward "possesses contacts with certain sections of opinion which are very difficult to reach through ordinary sources".&lt;ref&gt;Lesley, p. 215&lt;/ref&gt;|group= n}} He was frustrated by British press criticism of his foreign travel while his countrymen suffered at home, but he was unable to reveal that he was acting on behalf of the Secret Service.&lt;ref name=hastings&gt;Hastings, Chris. [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1568190/Winston-Churchill-vetoed-Coward-knighthood.html "Winston Churchill vetoed Coward knighthood"], Telegraph.co.uk, 3 November 2007, accessed 4 January 2009&lt;/ref&gt; In 1942 [[George VI]] wished to award Coward a knighthood for his efforts, but was dissuaded by [[Winston Churchill]]. Mindful of the public view of Coward's flamboyant lifestyle, Churchill used, as his reason for withholding the honour, Coward's £200 fine for contravening currency regulations in 1941.&lt;ref name=hastings /&gt;

Had the Germans invaded Britain, Coward was scheduled to be arrested and killed, as he was in [[The Black Book]] along with other figures such as [[Virginia Woolf]], [[Paul Robeson]], [[Bertrand Russell]], [[C. P. Snow]] and [[H. G. Wells]]. When this came to light after the war, Coward wrote: "If anyone had told me at that time I was high up on the [[Nazi]] blacklist, I should have laughed&amp;nbsp;... I remember [[Rebecca West]], who was one of the many who shared the honour with me, sent me a telegram which read: 'My dear – the people we should have been seen dead with'."&lt;ref&gt;Coward (''Future Indefinite''), p. 121&lt;/ref&gt;

Churchill's view was that Coward would do more for the war effort by entertaining the troops and the home front than by intelligence work: "Go and sing to them when the guns are firing – that's your job!"&lt;ref&gt;Morley, p. 246&lt;/ref&gt; Coward, though disappointed, followed this advice. He toured, acted and sang indefatigably in Europe, Africa, Asia and America.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,857528-1,00.html "Light Entertainment",] ''Time'', 19 July 1954, accessed 4 January 2009&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote and recorded war-themed popular songs, including "[[London Pride (song)|London Pride]]" and "[[Don't Let's Be Beastly to the Germans]]". His London home was wrecked by German bombs in 1941, and he took up temporary residence at the [[Savoy Hotel]].&lt;ref&gt;Hoare, p. 317&lt;/ref&gt; During one air raid on the area around the Savoy he joined [[Carroll Gibbons]] and [[Judy Campbell]] in impromptu cabaret to distract the captive guests from their fears.&lt;ref&gt;Hoare, p. 318&lt;/ref&gt; Another of Coward's wartime projects, as writer, star, composer and co-director (alongside David Lean), was the naval film drama ''[[In Which We Serve]]''. The film was popular on both sides of the Atlantic, and he was awarded an [[Academy Honorary Award|honorary certificate of merit]] at the [[15th Academy Awards|1943 Academy Awards]] ceremony.&lt;ref&gt;[http://awardsdatabase.oscars.org/ampas_awards/DisplayMain.jsp?curTime=1386189663593 "In Which we Serve"] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20131205161150/http://awardsdatabase.oscars.org/ampas_awards/DisplayMain.jsp?curTime=1386189663593 |date=5 December 2013 }}, Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, accessed 5 December 2013&lt;/ref&gt; Coward played a naval captain, basing the character on his friend [[Louis Mountbatten, 1st Earl Mountbatten of Burma|Lord Louis Mountbatten]]. Lean went on to direct and adapt film versions of several Coward plays.&lt;ref name=Kenrick2 /&gt;

Coward's most enduring work from the war years was the hugely successful black comedy ''[[Blithe Spirit (play)|Blithe Spirit]]'' (1941), about a novelist who researches the [[occult]] and hires a medium. A séance brings back the ghost of his first wife, causing havoc for the novelist and his second wife.&lt;ref name=Kenrick2 /&gt; With 1,997 consecutive performances, it broke box-office records for the run of a West End comedy, and was also produced on Broadway, where its original run was 650 performances.{{#tag:ref|The record (1,466 performances) had been held by ''[[Charley's Aunt]]'' since the 1890s.&lt;ref&gt;Gaye, p. 1525&lt;/ref&gt; ''Blithe Spirit's'' West End record was overtaken by ''[[Boeing Boeing (play)|Boeing Boeing]]'' in the 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20060321201520/http://www.globetheatrelive.com/20052006season/Blithe%20Spirit/Blithe%20Spirit%20Study%20Guide.pdf ''Blithe Spirit''], 2005/2006 Study Guide, Globe Theatre Guide, accessed 4 January 2009&lt;/ref&gt;|group= n}} The play was adapted into a [[Blithe Spirit (film)|1945 film]], directed by Lean. Coward toured during 1942 in ''Blithe Spirit'', alternating the piece with his comedy ''Present Laughter'' and his working-class drama ''This Happy Breed''.&lt;ref&gt;Hoare, p. 331&lt;/ref&gt;

In his ''Middle East Diary'' Coward made several statements that offended many Americans. In particular, he commented that he was "less impressed by some of the mournful little [[Brooklyn]] boys lying there in tears amid the alien corn with nothing worse than a bullet wound in the leg or a fractured arm".&lt;ref&gt;Calder, Robert. [https://books.google.com/books?id=HcpChZmn9s4C&amp;pg=PA103&amp;lpg=PA103#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false ''Beware the British serpent''], p. 103&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hoare, p. 341&lt;/ref&gt; After protests from both ''[[The New York Times]]'' and ''[[The Washington Post]]'', the Foreign Office urged Coward not to visit the United States in January 1945. He did not return to America again during the war. In the aftermath of the war, Coward wrote an [[alternate history|alternative reality]] play, ''[[Peace in Our Time (play)|Peace In Our Time]]'', depicting an England occupied by [[Nazi Germany]].&lt;ref name=lahr93 /&gt;

=== Post-war career ===
Coward's new plays after the war were moderately successful but failed to match the popularity of his pre-war hits.&lt;ref&gt;Lahr, p. 136&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Relative Values (play)|Relative Values]]'' (1951) addresses the culture clash between an aristocratic English family and a Hollywood actress with matrimonial ambitions; ''[[South Sea Bubble (play)|South Sea Bubble]]'' (1951) is a political comedy set in a British colony; ''[[Quadrille (play)|Quadrille]]'' (1952) is a drama about Victorian love and elopement; and ''[[Nude with Violin]]'' (1956, starring [[John Gielgud]] in London and Coward in New York) is a satire on modern art and critical pretension.&lt;ref&gt;Lesley, pp. 314, 370 and 361&lt;/ref&gt; A revue, ''[[Sigh No More (musical)|Sigh No More]]'' (1945), was a moderate success,&lt;ref&gt;Morley, p. 308&lt;/ref&gt; but two musicals, ''[[Pacific 1860]]'' (1946), a lavish [[South Seas (genre)|South Seas]] romance, and ''[[Ace of Clubs (musical)|Ace of Clubs]]'' (1949), set in a night club, were financial failures.&lt;ref&gt;Lesley, pp. 248 and 289&lt;/ref&gt; Further blows in this period were the deaths of Coward's friends Charles Cochran and Gertrude Lawrence, in 1951 and 1952 respectively. Despite his disappointments, Coward maintained a high public profile; his performance as King Magnus in Shaw's ''[[The Apple Cart]]'' for the Coronation season of 1953, co-starring [[Margaret Leighton]], received much coverage in the press,&lt;ref&gt;"Haymarket Theatre", ''The Times'', 8 May 1953, p. 12; and Brown, Ivor. "Royal and Ancient", ''The Manchester Guardian'', 8 May 1953, p. 5&lt;/ref&gt; and his cabaret act, honed during his wartime tours entertaining the troops, was a supreme success, first in London at the [[Café de Paris (London)|Café de Paris]], and later in [[Las Vegas Strip|Las Vegas]].&lt;ref&gt;Morley, pp. 339–40&lt;/ref&gt; The theatre critic Kenneth Tynan wrote:
{{quote|To see him whole, public and private personalities conjoined, you must see him in cabaret&amp;nbsp;... he padded down the celebrated stairs{{space}}... halted before the microphone on black-suede-clad feet, and, upraising both hands in a gesture of benediction, set about demonstrating how these things should be done. Baring his teeth as if unveiling some grotesque monument, and cooing like a [[baritone]] dove, he gave us "I'll See You Again" and the other bat's-wing melodies of his youth. Nothing he does on these occasions sounds strained or arid; his tanned, leathery face is still an enthusiast's.... If it is possible to romp fastidiously, that is what Coward does. He owes little to earlier wits, such as [[Oscar Wilde|Wilde]] or [[Henry Labouchère|Labouchere]]. Their best things need to be delivered slowly, even lazily. Coward's emerge with the staccato, blind impulsiveness of a machine-gun.&lt;ref name=tynan /&gt;}}

In 1955 Coward's cabaret act at Las Vegas, recorded live for the gramophone, and released as ''[[Noël Coward at Las Vegas]]''&lt;ref&gt;Reissued in 2003 on CD by CBS – DRG 19037&lt;/ref&gt; was so successful that [[CBS]] engaged him to write and direct a series of three 90-minute television specials for the 1955–56 season. The first of these, ''Together With Music'', paired Coward with [[Mary Martin]], featuring him in many of the numbers from his Las Vegas act.&lt;ref&gt;Kenrick, John.

Despite excellent reviews, the audience viewing figures were moderate.&lt;ref&gt;Payn and Morley, pp. 287–88, 304 and 314&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Private Lives Theatre De Lys.jpg|left|thumb|"Dad's Renaissance": Coward's popularity surged in the 1960s; this poster features [[Al Hirschfeld|Al Hirschfeld's]] drawing of Coward rather than the stars of this 1968 revival.]]
During the 1950s and 1960s Coward continued to write musicals and plays. ''[[After the Ball (musical)|After the Ball]]'', his 1953 adaptation of ''[[Lady Windermere's Fan]]'', was the last musical he premiered in the West End; his last two musicals were first produced on Broadway. ''[[Sail Away (musical)|Sail Away]]'' (1961), set on a luxury cruise liner, was Coward's most successful post-war musical, with productions in America, Britain and Australia.&lt;ref&gt;Lesley, pp. 410–14, and 428–29&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Girl Who Came to Supper]]'', a musical adaptation of ''[[The Sleeping Prince (play)|The Sleeping Prince]]'' (1963), ran for only three months.&lt;ref&gt;Lesley, p. 430&lt;/ref&gt; He directed the successful 1964 Broadway musical adaptation of ''Blithe Spirit'', called ''[[High Spirits (musical)|High Spirits]]''. Coward's late plays include a farce, ''[[Look After Lulu!]]'' (1959), and a tragi-comic study of old age, ''[[Waiting in the Wings (play)|Waiting in the Wings]]'' (1960), both of which were successful despite "critical disdain".&lt;ref&gt;[[John Simon (critic)|Simon, John]]. [http://nymag.com/nymetro/arts/theater/reviews/1773/ "Waiting in the Wings",] ''The NY Magazine'', 3 January 2000, accessed 8 February 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Coward argued that the primary purpose of a play was to entertain, and he made no attempt at modernism, which he felt was boring to the audience although fascinating to the critics. His comic novel, ''Pomp and Circumstance'' (1960), about life in a tropical British colony, met with more critical success.&lt;ref&gt;Payn and Morley, pp. 451 and 453&lt;/ref&gt;{{#tag:ref|Coward's fictional [[South Sea Islands]] colony, "Samolo", was loosely based on Jamaica, where he had a home; he used it as the setting not only for his novel, but for two plays (''Point Valaine'' and ''[[South Sea Bubble (play)|South Sea Bubble]]'') and a musical (''[[Pacific 1860]]'').&lt;ref&gt;Coward, ''Plays, Six'', p. xi&lt;/ref&gt;|group= n}}

Coward's final stage success came with ''Suite in Three Keys'' (1966), a trilogy set in a hotel penthouse suite. He wrote it as his swan song as a stage actor: "I would like to act once more before I fold my bedraggled wings."&lt;ref&gt;Coward, ''Plays, Five'', introduction, unnumbered page&lt;/ref&gt; The trilogy gained glowing reviews and did good box office business in the UK.&lt;ref&gt;Morley, p. 375&lt;/ref&gt; In one of the three plays, ''[[A Song at Twilight]]'', Coward abandoned his customary reticence on the subject and played an explicitly homosexual character. The daring piece earned Coward new critical praise.&lt;ref&gt;"Noel Coward's Skeleton Feast", ''The Times'', 15 April 1966, p. 16&lt;/ref&gt; He intended to star in the trilogy on Broadway but was too ill to travel. Only two of the ''Suite in Three Keys'' plays were performed in New York, with the title changed to ''Noël Coward in Two Keys'', starring [[Hume Cronyn]].&lt;ref&gt;Hoare, p. 502&lt;/ref&gt;

Coward won new popularity in several notable films later in his career, such as ''[[Around the World in 80 Days (1956 film)|Around the World in 80 Days]]'' (1956), ''[[Our Man in Havana (film)|Our Man in Havana]]'' (1959), ''[[Bunny Lake Is Missing]]'' (1965), ''[[Boom! (film)|Boom!]]'' (1968) and ''[[The Italian Job]]'' (1969).&lt;ref&gt;Hoare, pp. 380, 414, 491, 507 and 508&lt;/ref&gt; Stage and film opportunities he turned down in the 1950s included an invitation to compose a musical version of ''[[Pygmalion (play)|Pygmalion]]'' (two years before ''[[My Fair Lady]]'' was written), and offers of the roles of the king in the original stage production of ''[[The King and I]]'', and Colonel Nicholson in the film ''[[The Bridge on the River Kwai]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Hoare, pp. 387, 386, and 473&lt;/ref&gt; Invited to play the title role in the 1962 film ''[[Dr. No (film)|Dr. No]]'', he replied, "No, no, no, a thousand times, no."&lt;ref&gt;Day, p. 310&lt;/ref&gt; In the same year, he turned down the role of Humbert Humbert in ''[[Lolita (1962 film)|Lolita]]'', saying, "At my time of life the film story would be logical if the 12-year-old heroine was a sweet little old lady."&lt;ref&gt;Richards, p. 83&lt;/ref&gt;

In the mid-1960s and early 1970s successful productions of his 1920s and 1930s plays, and new revues celebrating his music, including ''[[Oh, Coward!]]'' on Broadway and ''[[Cowardy Custard]]'' in London, revived Coward's popularity and critical reputation. He dubbed this comeback "Dad's Renaissance".&lt;ref&gt;Hoare p. 479 ''et seq.''&lt;/ref&gt; It began with a hit 1963 revival of ''Private Lives'' in London and then New York.&lt;ref&gt;Morley, pp. 370–72&lt;/ref&gt; Invited to direct ''Hay Fever'' with [[Edith Evans]] at the [[Royal National Theatre|National Theatre]], he wrote in 1964, "I am thrilled and flattered and frankly a little flabbergasted that the National Theatre should have had the curious perceptiveness to choose a very early play of mine and to give it a cast that could play the Albanian telephone directory."&lt;ref&gt;Morley, p. 369&lt;/ref&gt;

Other examples of "Dad's Renaissance" included a 1968 [[Off-Broadway]] production of ''Private Lives'' at the [[Lucille Lortel Theatre|Theatre de Lys]] starring [[Elaine Stritch]], [[Lee Bowman]] and [[Betsy von Furstenberg]], and directed by [[Charles Nelson Reilly]]. Despite this impressive cast, Coward's popularity had risen so high that the theatre poster for the production used an [[Al Hirschfeld]] caricature of Coward (''pictured'') {{#tag:ref|The caricature was also used in connection with other Coward works, for example on his album of his ballet suite, "London Morning" (1959; reissued in 1978 on LP on DRG SL 5180 with the Hirschfeld drawing on the cover)|group= n}} instead of an image of the production or its stars. The illustration captures how Coward's image had changed by the 1960s: he was no longer seen as the smooth 1930s sophisticate, but as the doyen of the theatre. As ''[[New Statesman|The New Statesman]]'' wrote in 1964, "Who would have thought the landmarks of the Sixties would include the emergence of Noël Coward as the grand old man of British drama? There he was one morning, flipping verbal tiddlywinks with reporters about "Dad's Renaissance"; the next he was{{space}}... beside [[E. M. Forster|Forster]], [[T. S. Eliot]] and the [[Order of Merit|OMs]], demonstrably the greatest living English playwright."&lt;ref&gt;Ronald Bryden in ''The New Statesman'', August 1964, ''quoted'' in Hoare, p. 479&lt;/ref&gt; ''Time'' wrote that "in the 60s... his best work, with its inspired inconsequentiality, seemed to exert not only a period charm but charm, period."&lt;ref name=Time1969 /&gt;

By the end of the 1960s, Coward suffered from [[arteriosclerosis]] and, during the run of ''Suite in Three Keys'', he struggled with bouts of memory loss.&lt;ref&gt;Hoare, p. 501&lt;/ref&gt; This also affected his work in ''The Italian Job'', and he retired from acting immediately afterwards.&lt;ref&gt;Lesley, p. 454&lt;/ref&gt; Coward was [[Knight Bachelor|knighted]] in 1969 and was elected a fellow of the [[Royal Society of Literature]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ukwhoswho.com/view/article/oupww/whowaswho/U153506/COWARD_Sir_Noel?index=1&amp;results=QuicksearchResults&amp;query=0 "Coward, Sir Noël"], ''Who Was Who'', A &amp; C Black, 1920–2008; online edition, Oxford University Press, December 2007, accessed 12 March 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; He received a [[Tony Award]] for lifetime achievement.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.noelcoward.net/html/chronology.html "Chronology"], The Noël Coward Society], May 2001, accessed 27 August 2008&lt;/ref&gt; In 1972, he was awarded an honorary [[Doctor of Letters]] degree by the [[University of Sussex]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.sussex.ac.uk/webteam/gateway/file.php?name=list-of-honorary-graduates.pdf&amp;site=76 "List of Honorary Graduates"], University of Sussex, accessed 17 December 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

Coward died at his home, [[Firefly Estate]], in [[Jamaica]] on 26 March 1973 of heart failure&lt;ref name=timesobit /&gt; and was buried three days later on the brow of Firefly Hill, overlooking the north coast of the island.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, Scott.

McFarland &amp; Company (2016) {{ISBN|0786479922}}&lt;/ref&gt; A memorial service was held in [[St Martin-in-the-Fields]] in London on 29 May 1973, for which the [[Poet Laureate]], [[John Betjeman]], wrote and delivered a poem in Coward's honour, {{#tag:ref|"We are all here today to thank the Lord for the life of Noel Coward.&lt;br /&gt;Noel with two dots over the 'e'&lt;br /&gt;And the firm decided downward stroke of the 'l'.&lt;br /&gt;We can all see him in our mind's eye&lt;br /&gt;And in our mind's ear&lt;br /&gt;We can hear the clipped decided voice".&lt;ref&gt;Lesley, p. 481&lt;/ref&gt;|group= n}} John Gielgud and Laurence Olivier read verse and [[Yehudi Menuhin]] played [[Johann Sebastian Bach|Bach]]. On 28 March 1984 a memorial stone was unveiled by the [[Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon|Queen Mother]] in [[Poets' Corner]], [[Westminster Abbey]]. Thanked by Coward's partner, [[Graham Payn]], for attending, the Queen Mother replied, "I came because he was my friend."&lt;ref&gt;Day, p. 725&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Noël Coward Theatre]] in [[St Martin's Lane]], originally opened in 1903 as the New Theatre and later called the Albery, was renamed in his honour after extensive refurbishment, re-opening on 1 June 2006.&lt;ref&gt;Davies, Hugh. "Coward is the toast of theatreland again", ''The Daily Telegraph'', 1 July 2006, p. 14&lt;/ref&gt; A statue of Coward by [[Angela Conner]] was unveiled by the Queen Mother in the foyer of the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane in 1998.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/230250.stm "Coward statue unveiled"], BBC news, 8 December 1998, accessed 8 February 2009&lt;/ref&gt; There are also sculptures of Coward displayed in New York and Jamaica,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.noelcoward.net/html/centenary.html "Centenary Year – 1999"], The Noël Coward Society, accessed 10 March 2009 and Koss, p. 163&lt;/ref&gt; and a bust of him in the library in Teddington, near where he was born.&lt;ref&gt;{{NHLE|num=1396400 |desc=Teddington Library|accessdate=|ps=none}}, accessed 3 July 2014&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008 an exhibition devoted to Coward was mounted at the National Theatre in London.&lt;ref name=byrne&gt;Byrne, Ciar.

=== Personal life ===
[[File:Coward as Slightly.jpg|left|thumb|upright|Coward as [[Lost Boys (Peter Pan)|Slightly]] in ''[[Peter Pan]]'' in 1913]]
Coward was homosexual but, following the convention of his times, this was never publicly mentioned.&lt;ref name=C&amp;N /&gt; The critic Kenneth Tynan's description in 1953 was close to an acknowledgment of Coward's sexuality: "Forty years ago he was Slightly in ''Peter Pan'', and you might say that he has been wholly in ''Peter Pan'' ever since. No private considerations have been allowed to deflect the drive of his career; like Gielgud and [[Terence Rattigan|Rattigan]], like the late Ivor Novello, he is a congenital bachelor."&lt;ref name=tynan /&gt; Coward firmly believed his private business was not for public discussion, considering "''any'' sexual activities when over-advertised" to be tasteless.&lt;ref&gt;Payn, p. 248&lt;/ref&gt; Even in the 1960s, Coward refused to acknowledge his sexual orientation publicly, wryly observing, "There are still a few old ladies in [[Worthing]] who don't know."&lt;ref&gt;Hoare, p. 509&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this reticence, he encouraged his secretary Cole Lesley to write a frank biography once Coward was safely dead.&lt;ref&gt;Lesley, p. xvii&lt;/ref&gt;

Coward's most important relationship, which began in the mid-1940s and lasted until his death, was with the South African stage and film actor Graham Payn.&lt;ref&gt;Payn, ''passim''&lt;/ref&gt; Coward featured Payn in several of his London productions. Payn later co-edited with [[Sheridan Morley]] a collection of Coward's diaries, published in 1982. Coward's other relationships included the playwright Keith Winter, actors [[Louis Hayward]] and [[Alan Webb (actor)|Alan Webb]], his manager [[John C. Wilson|Jack Wilson]] and the composer [[Ned Rorem]], who published details of their relationship in his diaries.&lt;ref&gt;Hoare, pp. 162–63, 258, 261–62, 275, 273–74, and 469–70&lt;/ref&gt; Coward had a 19-year friendship with [[Prince George, Duke of Kent]], but biographers differ on whether it was platonic.&lt;ref&gt;Hoare, p. 122&lt;/ref&gt; Payn believed that it was, although Coward reportedly admitted to the historian Michael Thornton that there had been "a little dalliance".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.express.co.uk/expressyourself/304572/Upstairs-life-of-a-royal-rogue "Upstairs life of a royal rogue"], ''[[The Daily Express]]'', 26 February 2012&lt;/ref&gt; Coward said, on the duke's death, "I suddenly find that I loved him more than I knew."&lt;ref&gt;Lesley, p. 231&lt;/ref&gt;

Coward maintained close friendships with many women, including the actress and author Esmé Wynne-Tyson, his first collaborator and constant correspondent; [[Gladys Calthrop]], who designed sets and costumes for many of his works; his secretary and close confidante Lorn Loraine; the actresses Gertrude Lawrence, [[Joyce Carey]] and Judy Campbell; and "his loyal and lifelong ''amitié amoureuse''", [[Marlene Dietrich]].&lt;ref&gt;Lesley, p. 176&lt;/ref&gt;

In his profession, Coward was widely admired and loved for his generosity and kindness to those who fell on hard times. Stories are told of the unobtrusive way in which he relieved the needs or paid the debts of old theatrical acquaintances who had no claim on him.&lt;ref name=timesobit /&gt; From 1934 until 1956, Coward was the president of the [[Actors Orphanage]], which was supported by the theatrical industry. In that capacity, he befriended the young [[Peter Collinson (film director)|Peter Collinson]], who was in the care of the orphanage. He became Collinson's godfather and helped him to get started in show business. When Collinson was a successful director, he invited Coward to play a role in ''The Italian Job''. Graham Payn also played a small role in the film.&lt;ref&gt;Payn and Morley, p. 668&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Sir Noel Coward Switzerland Allan Warren.jpg|thumb|upright|right|Coward in his home in Switzerland in 1972]]
In 1926, Coward acquired [[Goldenhurst Farm]], in [[Aldington, Kent]], making it his home for most of the next thirty years, except when the military used it during the Second World War.&lt;ref&gt;Clark, Ross. [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/property/3337128/Mad-about-the-house.html "Mad about the house"], ''The Telegraph'', 24 November 2004, accessed 27 August 2016&lt;/ref&gt; It is a [[Grade II* listed buildings in Kent|Grade II listed building]].&lt;ref&gt;{{NHLE|num=1071221 |desc=Goldenhurst Manor|accessdate=|ps=none}}, accessed 24 August 2016&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1950s, Coward left the UK for tax reasons, receiving harsh criticism in the press.&lt;ref&gt;Lesley, p. 355&lt;/ref&gt; He first settled in [[Bermuda]] but later bought houses in Jamaica and Switzerland (in the village of [[Les Avants]], near [[Montreux]]), which remained his homes for the rest of his life.&lt;ref&gt;Lesley, p. 395&lt;/ref&gt; His expatriate neighbours and friends included [[Joan Sutherland]], [[David Niven]], [[Richard Burton]] and [[Elizabeth Taylor]], and [[Julie Andrews]] and [[Blake Edwards]] in Switzerland&lt;ref&gt;Lesley, p. 437&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Ian Fleming]] and his wife [[Ann Fleming|Ann]] in Jamaica. Coward was a witness at the Flemings' wedding, but his diaries record his exasperation with their constant bickering.&lt;ref&gt;Lesley, p. 310; and Payn and Morley, p. 463&lt;/ref&gt;

Coward's political views were conservative, but not unswervingly so: he despised the government of [[Neville Chamberlain]] for its policy of [[appeasement|appeasing]] Nazi Germany, and he differed sharply with Winston Churchill over the [[Edward VIII abdication crisis|abdication crisis]] of 1936. Whereas Churchill supported [[Edward VIII]]'s wish to marry "his cutie", [[Wallis, Duchess of Windsor|Wallis Simpson]], Coward thought the king irresponsible, telling Churchill, "England doesn't wish for a Queen Cutie."&lt;ref&gt;Lesley, pp. 187 and 197&lt;/ref&gt; Coward disliked propaganda in plays; "The theatre is a wonderful place, a house of strange enchantment, a temple of illusion. What it most emphatically is not and never will be is a scruffy, ill-lit, fumed-oak drill hall serving as a temporary soap box for political propaganda."&lt;ref name=m101&gt;Kenrick, John. [http://www.musicals101.com/noelquot.htm "Noel Coward 101: Cowardy Quotations"], Musicals101.com, The Cyber Encyclopedia of Musical Theatre, TV and Film, accessed 8 February 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, his own views sometimes surfaced in his plays: both ''Cavalcade'' and ''This Happy Breed'' are, in the words of the playwright [[David Edgar (playwright)|David Edgar]], "overtly Conservative political plays written in the [[Bertolt Brecht|Brechtian]] epic manner."&lt;ref&gt;Kaplan, p. 4&lt;/ref&gt; In religion, Coward was agnostic. He wrote of his views, "Do I believe in God? I can't say No and I can't say Yes, To me it's anybody's guess."&lt;ref&gt;Coward (''Not Yet the Dodo''), p. 54.&lt;/ref&gt;{{#tag:ref|Coward also said, "I keep an open mind, but I will be somewhat surprised if St Peter taps me on the shoulder and says: 'This way, Noël Coward, come up and try your hand on the harp.' I am no harpist."&lt;ref&gt;Richards, pp. 64–65&lt;/ref&gt;|group= n}}

Coward spelled his first name with the [[Diaeresis (diacritic)|diæresis]] ("''I'' didn't put the dots over the 'e' in Noël. The language did. Otherwise it's not Noël but Nool!").&lt;ref&gt;Richards, p. 58&lt;/ref&gt; The press and many book publishers failed to follow suit, and his name was printed as 'Noel' in ''The Times'', ''The Observer'' and other contemporary newspapers and books.{{#tag:ref|Even Cole Lesley's 1976 biography refers to Coward as "Noel": "...I have also forgone the use of his beloved diaeresis over the 'e' in his name, having no wish to dizzy the eye of the reader."&lt;ref name=lxx&gt;Lesley, p. xx&lt;/ref&gt;|group= n}} The papers of Noël Coward are held in the [[University of Birmingham]].{{#tag:ref|The papers were transferred from the flat of Mrs J.

"Why", asked Coward, "am I always expected to wear a dressing-gown, smoke cigarettes in a [[Cigarette holder|long holder]] and say 'Darling, how wonderful'?"&lt;ref&gt;Richards, p. 59&lt;/ref&gt; The answer lay in Coward's assiduous cultivation of a carefully crafted image. As a suburban boy who had been taken up by the upper classes he rapidly acquired the taste for high life: "I am determined to travel through life first class."&lt;ref&gt;Richards, p. 28&lt;/ref&gt; He first wore a dressing gown onstage in ''The Vortex'' and used the fashion in several of his other famous plays, including ''Private Lives'' and ''Present Laughter''.&lt;ref&gt;Sacheli, Robert. [http://www.dandyism.net/?p=258#more-258 "Joyeux Noel"], Dandyism.net, 16 December 2006, accessed 17 March 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Private Lives'', Act II, ''passim''&lt;/ref&gt; [[George Walden]] identifies him as a modern [[dandy]].&lt;ref&gt;Barbey D'Aurevilly, p. 45&lt;/ref&gt; In connection with the National Theatre's 2008 exhibition, ''[[The Independent]]'' commented, "His famous silk, polka-dot dressing gown and elegant cigarette holder both seem to belong to another era. But 2008 is proving to be the year that Britain falls in love with Noël Coward all over again."&lt;ref name=byrne /&gt;

As soon as he achieved success he began polishing the Coward image: an early press photograph showed him sitting up in bed holding a cigarette holder: "I looked like an advanced Chinese decadent in the last phases of dope."&lt;ref&gt;Castle, p. 66&lt;/ref&gt; Soon after that, Coward wrote, "I took to wearing coloured turtle-necked jerseys, actually more for comfort than for effect, and soon I was informed by my evening paper that I had started a fashion. I believe that to a certain extent this was true; at any rate, during the ensuing months I noticed more and more of our seedier West-End chorus boys parading about London in them."&lt;ref&gt;Coward (''Present Indicative''), p. 183&lt;/ref&gt; He soon became more cautious about overdoing the flamboyance, advising [[Cecil Beaton]] to tone down his outfits: "It is important not to let the public have a loophole to lampoon you."&lt;ref&gt;Hoare, p. 201&lt;/ref&gt; However, Coward was happy to generate publicity from his lifestyle.&lt;ref name=Kenrick2 /&gt; In 1969 he told ''Time'' magazine, "I acted up like crazy. I did everything that was expected of me. Part of the job." ''Time'' concluded, "Coward's greatest single gift has not been writing or composing, not acting or directing, but projecting a sense of personal style, a combination of cheek and chic, pose and poise."&lt;ref name=Time1969 /&gt;

Coward's distinctive clipped diction arose from his childhood: his mother was deaf and Coward developed his staccato style of speaking to make it easier for her to hear what he was saying; it also helped him eradicate a slight lisp.&lt;ref&gt;Hoare, p. 16&lt;/ref&gt; His nickname, "The Master", "started as a joke and became true", according to Coward. It was used of him from the 1920s onwards.&lt;ref name=lxx /&gt; Coward himself made light of it: when asked by a journalist why he was known as "The Master", he replied, "Oh, you know – Jack of all trades, master of none."&lt;ref&gt;Richards, p. 65&lt;/ref&gt; He could, however, joke about his own immodesty: "My sense of my importance to the world is relatively small. On the other hand, my sense of my own importance to myself is tremendous."&lt;ref&gt;Richards, p. 67&lt;/ref&gt; When a ''Time'' interviewer apologised, "I hope you haven't been bored having to go through all these interviews for your [70th] birthday, having to answer the same old questions about yourself", Coward rejoined, "Not at all. I'm fascinated by the subject."&lt;ref name=Time1969 /&gt;

== Critical reputation and legacy ==
{{Main|Cultural impact of Noël Coward}}

The playwright [[John Osborne]] said, "Mr Coward is his own invention and contribution to this century. Anyone who cannot see that should keep well away from the theatre."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.noelcoward.com/ "Noel Coward"], Introduction page to NoelCoward.com, accessed 8 February 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Tynan wrote in 1964, "Even the youngest of us will know, in fifty years' time, exactly what we mean by 'a very Noel Coward sort of person'."&lt;ref name=tynan /&gt; In praise of Coward's versatility, [[Louis Mountbatten, 1st Earl Mountbatten of Burma|Lord Mountbatten]] said, in a tribute on Coward's seventieth birthday, "There are probably greater painters than Noël, greater novelists than Noël, greater librettists, greater composers of music, greater singers, greater dancers, greater comedians, greater tragedians, greater stage producers, greater film directors, greater cabaret artists, greater TV stars. If there are, they are fourteen different people. Only one man combined all fourteen different labels – The Master."&lt;ref&gt;Day, p. 3&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Noel Coward (1963) by Erling Mandelmann - 2.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Coward in 1963]]
Tynan's was the first generation of critics to realise that Coward's plays might enjoy more than ephemeral success. In the 1930s, [[Cyril Connolly]] wrote that they were "written in the most topical and perishable way imaginable, the cream in them turns sour overnight".&lt;ref&gt;Lahr, p. 2&lt;/ref&gt; What seemed daring in the 1920s and 1930s came to seem old-fashioned in the 1950s, and Coward never repeated the success of his pre-war plays.&lt;ref name=tynan /&gt; By the 1960s, critics began to note that underneath the witty dialogue and the [[Art Deco]] glamour of the inter-war years, Coward's best plays also dealt with recognisable people and familiar relationships, with an emotional depth and pathos that had been often overlooked.&lt;ref&gt;Kaplan, pp. 7–13&lt;/ref&gt; By the time of his death, ''The Times'' was writing of him, "None of the great figures of the English theatre has been more versatile than he", and the paper ranked his plays in "the classical tradition of [[William Congreve|Congreve]], [[Richard Sheridan|Sheridan]], Wilde and Shaw".&lt;ref name=timesobit&gt;"Obituary: Sir Noel Coward", ''The Times'', 27 March 1973, p. 18&lt;/ref&gt;

A symposium published in 1999 to mark the centenary of Coward's birth listed some of his major productions scheduled for the year in Britain and North America, including ''Ace of Clubs, After the Ball, Blithe Spirit, Cavalcade, Easy Virtue, Hay Fever, Present Laughter, Private Lives, Sail Away, A Song at Twilight, The Young Idea'' and ''Waiting in the Wings'', with stars including Lauren Bacall, [[Rosemary Harris]], [[Ian McKellen]], [[Corin Redgrave]], [[Vanessa Redgrave]] and Elaine Stritch.&lt;ref&gt;Kaplan, pp. 217–21&lt;/ref&gt; In another tribute, [[Tim Rice]] said of Coward's songs: "The wit and wisdom of Noël Coward's lyrics will be as lively and contemporary in 100 years' time as they are today",&lt;ref name=m101 /&gt; and many have been recorded by [[Damon Albarn]], [[Ian Bostridge]], [[The Divine Comedy (band)|The Divine Comedy]], [[Elton John]], [[Valerie Masterson]], [[Paul McCartney]], [[Michael Nyman]], [[Pet Shop Boys]], [[Vic Reeves]], [[Sting (musician)|Sting]], Joan Sutherland, [[Robbie Williams]] and others.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldcat.org/title/twentieth-century-blues-the-songs-of-noel-coward/oclc/44734242&amp;referer=brief_results "Twentieth-century blues: the songs of Noel Coward"], [http://www.worldcat.org/title/ian-bostridge-noel-coward-songbook/oclc/815766527&amp;referer=brief_results "Ian Bostridge: Noël Coward songbook"]; and [http://www.worldcat.org/title/sutherland-sings-noel-coward-songs-from-bitter-sweet-after-the-ball-and-more-featuring-noel-coward/oclc/51236890&amp;referer=brief_results "Sutherland sings Noel Coward"], WorldCat, accessed 5 December 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

Coward's music, writings, characteristic voice and style have been widely parodied and imitated, for instance in ''[[Monty Python]]'', ''[[Round the Horne]]'' and ''[[Privates on Parade]]''.&lt;ref&gt;"Sir Noel (Pierce) Coward", ''Cambridge Encyclopedia'', Vol. 69&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nichols, Peter: ''Privates on Parade'', Act 2, Scene 1 ("Noël, Noël")&lt;/ref&gt; Coward has frequently been depicted as a character in plays,&lt;ref&gt;Hoare, Philip.

Coward was an early admirer of the plays of [[Harold Pinter]] and backed Pinter's film version of ''[[The Caretaker]]'' with a £1,000 investment.&lt;ref name=hoare458&gt;Hoare, p. 458&lt;/ref&gt; Some critics have detected Coward's influence in Pinter's plays.&lt;ref&gt;Hoare, p. 269&lt;/ref&gt; Tynan compared Pinter's "elliptical patter" to Coward's "stylised dialogue".&lt;ref name=hoare458 /&gt; Pinter returned the compliment by directing the National Theatre's revival of ''Blithe Spirit'' in 1976.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.haroldpinter.org/directing/directing_spirit.shtml "Blithe Spirit by Noel Coward, The National Theatre, June 1976 (and tour)"] at haroldpinter.org, 2003, accessed 7 March 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

Coward was no fan of the works of [[Gilbert and Sullivan]],{{#tag:ref|"I went to ''[[Iolanthe]]''... beautifully done and the music lovely but dated. It's no use, I ''hate'' Gilbert and Sullivan".&lt;ref&gt;Day, p. 125&lt;/ref&gt;|group= n}} but as a songwriter was nevertheless strongly influenced by them. He recalled: "I was born into a generation that still took light music seriously. The lyrics and melodies of Gilbert and Sullivan were hummed and strummed into my consciousness at an early age. My father sang them, my mother played them{{space}}... my aunts and uncles, who were legion, sang them singly and in unison at the slightest provocation."&lt;ref&gt;Programme note for ''[[Cowardy Custard]]'' (1972) quoting ''The Noël Coward Song Book''&lt;/ref&gt; His colleague Terence Rattigan wrote that as a lyricist Coward was "the best of his kind since [[W. S. Gilbert]]."&lt;ref&gt;Day, p. 257&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:KeepstoneFetchcropped.JPG|thumb|right|A [[Border Collie]] [[Sheepdog trial|herding]]. This behaviour is an example of modified prey drive.]]
:''Eye-stalking, the tendency to watch potential prey, redirects here. For the study of eye movement, see [[eye tracking]]. For eyes on the ends of stalks, see [[eyestalk]]''
'''Prey drive''' is the [[instinct]]ive inclination of a [[carnivore]] to find, pursue and capture [[prey]]. The term is chiefly used to describe and analyse habits in [[dog training]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.darnfar.com/Dog%20Training/how_to_choose_the_right_breed.htm |title=How To Choose The Right Breed |publisher=Darnfar.com |date= |accessdate=2011-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;
==Aspects==
In all predators the prey drive follows an inevitable sequence: Search (orient, eye); Stalk; Chase; Bite (grab-bite, kill-bite); Dissect; Consume.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Coppinger|first=Raymond|title=Dogs, A New Understanding of Canine Origin, Behavior, and Evolution|year=2001|publisher=University of Chicago Press|pages=116}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Lindley&gt;[http://www.dogways.info/the-canine-prey-drive-instinct] article, "The Canine Prey Drive Instinct," Paul Lindley.&lt;/ref&gt; In wolves, the prey drive is complete and balanced, as it utilises the whole range from search to kill, ending in the consumption of the prey.&lt;ref name=Lindley/&gt;

In different breeds of dog certain steps of these five have been amplified or reduced by human-controlled [[selective breeding]] for various purposes.  The "search" aspect of the prey drive, for example, is most valuable in detection dogs such as [[bloodhound]]s and [[beagle]]s. The "eye-stalk" is a strong component of the behaviors used by [[herding dog]]s. The "chase" is seen most clearly in racing dogs such as [[Greyhounds]] and [[Lurcher]]s, while the "grab-bite" and "kill-bite" are valuable in the training of [[terrier]]s. 

In many breeds of dog, prey drive is so strong that the chance to satisfy the drive is its own reward, and extrinsic reinforcers are not required to compel the dog to perform the behaviour.

==Benefits==
In dog training, prey drive can be used as a performative advantage because dogs with strong prey drive are also willing to pursue moving objects such as toys, which can then be used to encourage certain kinds of behavior, such as that of [[greyhound racing]] or the speed required in [[dog agility]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thedogathlete.com/playing-with-prey-drive/ |title=Playing with Prey Drive: The Key to Attitude and Enthusiasm in Performance Dogs |publisher=The Dog Athlete |date= |accessdate=2011-12-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111127044930/http://www.thedogathlete.com/playing-with-prey-drive/ |archivedate=2011-11-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Prey drive can be an important component of pet [[dog training]], [[obedience training]] and [[schutzhund]] as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://flyballdogs.com/prey_drive.html |title=Understanding Prey Drive |publisher=Flyballdogs.com |date=1997-01-07 |accessdate=2011-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Games such as fetch and tug-of-war can be an effective motivator and reward for learning.

Certain aspects of the prey drive can be a disadvantage in some dogs.  In [[retriever]]s, for example, the dog is expected to chase prey and bring it back to the human hunter, but not bite or damage it.  Herding dogs must exhibit the stalking and chasing aspects of prey drive, but should have strongly inhibited grab bite and kill bite stages to prevent them wounding stock.  [[Bull Terrier]]s such as the [[Staffordshire bull terrier]] have an amplified grab-bite as they were originally bred to [[bull-baiting|bait bulls]] (restrain bulls by hanging onto their noses), but never needed to find or stalk the prey.

==Degrees==
Levels of prey drive often vary substantially in different dogs.  Therefore, a dog with low drive does not make a successful detection or search dog, but a dog who is too high in prey drive may be unsuitable as a pet for a suburban home, as it may become bored and destructive when its high drive is not regularly satisfied.

==Balance==
Dogs are happiest and most balanced in overall behavior when their prey drive is properly stimulated and satisfied through [[play (animal behavior)|play]]{{Citation needed|date=April 2017}}. Many professional dog trainers consider [[dog bite tug]] to be an effective training tool in prey drive and "retrieve" skills development.

The '''Savage Land''' is a hidden [[prehistory|prehistoric]] land appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. It is a [[Tropics|tropical]] preserve hidden in [[Antarctica]]. Throughout time, it has served as a basis for many story arcs in ''[[Uncanny X-Men]]'' as well as in related books.

==Publication history==
The Savage Land first appeared in ''[[X-Men]]'' #10 (March 1965) and was created by [[Stan Lee]] and [[Jack Kirby]].

==Fictional history==
{{In-universe|section|date=October 2009}}
The Savage Land was created by the alien [[List of alien races in Marvel Comics#N|Nuwali]] at the behest of the other-dimensional, nigh-omnipotent aliens known as the [[List of alien races in Marvel Comics#B|Beyonders]] who sought to observe the process of evolution under relatively controlled conditions and had the Nuwali set up a number of game preserves on several planets. One of these planets was Earth during the [[Triassic]] period where the Nuwali chose a valley in Antarctica surrounded by active [[volcano]]es, where they installed a number of advanced technological devices in order to maintain a tropical climate. The aliens then stocked the area with all manner of Earth life over the following several millennia. They also brought over the Man-Apes, earlier [[hominid]] ancestors of ''Homo sapiens''.

The Beyonders eventually grew bored with the experiment, and the Nuwali stopped maintaining the Savage Land during the Late [[Pleistocene]] (the Ice Age era). However, the self-maintaining technology that allowed the pocket of tropical climate was left running, and many species which became extinct in other areas of the Earth continued to thrive within the Savage Land.

Later on, a group of [[human]] survivors from [[Features of the Marvel Universe#Regions and countries|Atlantis]] sailed to Antarctica before the "Great Cataclysm" which sank Atlantis into the ocean. There, they discovered a cavern where they found an immense climate-controlling device and harnessed the technology used to keep the Savage Land's volcanoes working. They named their location "[[Pangaea|Pangea]]", which is Atlantean for "paradise".

They mastered [[genetic engineering]], which had been used on the Man-Apes when the Nuwali were still maintaining the Savage Land area. They used their genetic engineering techniques to transform other Savage Land inhabitants like the Golden People, the Lizard Men, the Reptile Men, the Tubantis, and others. The Atlanteans then forced them to work for them until these animal people revolted. After a time of war, the animal people demanded civil rights and the Atlanteans used technology to expand the Savage Land's surface area for the animal people to live in. When the Great Cataclysm struck, the Atlantean empire fell and thanks to the machines, the Savage Land locations were spared from sinking into the sea.

In more recent years, the Savage Land was rediscovered by Lord Robert Plunder, who took back a sample of the metal known as "anti-metal" or "Antarctic [[vibranium]]" with him. This mysterious metal had the ability to produce vibrations which would liquefy all other metals. Fleeing from those who sought to steal this discovery, Plunder took his eldest son Kevin with him for a second trip into the Savage Land. Unfortunately, the elder Plunder was killed by a local tribe of Man-Apes.

Kevin survived, thanks to the timely intervention of the orphaned [[Smilodon|sabretooth tiger]] later known as [[Zabu]]. He grew to adulthood in the Savage Land, becoming the adventurer known as [[Ka-Zar (comics)|Ka-Zar]]. Ka-Zar had many team-ups with the [[X-Men]], who first revealed the Savage Land's existence, [[Spider-Man]], and many other superheroes who had visited the Savage Land. He later met and married [[Shanna the She-Devil]].

The Savage Land's existence is common knowledge throughout the world. At one time, there were press junkets, sponsored by the oil company [[Roxxon Energy Corporation|Roxxon]]. ''[[Daily Bugle]]'' photographer [[Spider-Man|Peter Parker]] was sent and helped uncover Roxxon's unethical and dangerous manipulation of the local resources.

At one point, Spider-Man teamed up with Ka-Zar to save [[Gwen Stacy]] from [[Kraven the Hunter]] and [[Gog (Marvel Comics)|Gog]] at the time when her class and [[J. Jonah Jameson]] were visiting the Savage Land.&lt;ref&gt;''Amazing Spider-Man'' #103-104&lt;/ref&gt;

Many villains have threatened the Savage Land, including [[Sauron (comics)|Sauron]], [[Garokk]], [[Magneto (comics)|Magneto]], and [[Thanos]].

In issue #257 of "The Avengers" the Savage Land was decimated by an evil alien named Terminus (or one of his pawns) when he destroyed the machines that maintained the tropical climate. Many of the Savage Land's native people were saved from the ensuing destruction by M'rin: The Warlord of The Skies who took them into her own native dimension to safety. Ka-Zar, Shanna, and Zabu wandered until the [[High Evolutionary]] (with help from the X-Men, M'rin and Garokk) restored the region and its creatures, allowing them to return to the Savage Land with their newborn son. The other natives who had taken refuge in M'rin's dimension returned as well.

Sometime after that, Spider-Man had [[Devil Dinosaur]] and [[Moon-Boy]] emigrated to the Savage Land after rescuing them from [[Ringmaster (comics)|Ringmaster]].&lt;ref&gt;''Amazing Spider-Man Annual'' 1998&lt;/ref&gt;

Evidence in the pages of the ''[[The New Avengers (comics)|New Avengers]]'' suggests that [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] is operating in the Savage Land, mining vibranium while using the indigenous population as slave labor, but these operations have been classified, and the operation was apparently decimated by a missile strike from the [[Helicarrier]] during an attack by the New Avengers. The team only survived thanks to [[Iron Man]]'s force field.

The Savage Land is featured in the limited series ''Claws'', serving as a place of revenge for [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]] and [[Black Cat (Marvel Comics)|Black Cat]] on [[Arcade (Marvel Comics)|Arcade]] and [[White Rabbit (comics)|White Rabbit]]. After defeating the two villains, the heroes left them stranded.

In ''[[X-Men: Divided We Stand]]'', Cyclops and Emma Frost were vacationing there until Archangel contacted them about San Francisco looking like the 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;''Uncanny X-Men'' #495&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Kraven the Hunter (Alyosha Kravinoff)|Alyosha Kravinoff]] fled to the Savage Land after [[Punisher]] sabotaged his zoo.&lt;ref&gt;Punisher War Journal Vol. 2 #13-15&lt;/ref&gt;

During the ''[[Secret Invasion]]'' storyline, Ka-Zar and Shanna discover Skrulls mining for vibranium. The [[The New Avengers (comics)|New Avengers]] and the [[The Mighty Avengers|Mighty Avengers]] head toward the Savage Land where a downed [[Skrull]] ship was sighted. [[Luke Cage]] opens the downed Skrull ship and a large group of Marvel superheroes with older appearances and costumes come out, speaking as if they believe themselves to be authentic. They soon break out into a fight where the Spider-Man from the ship is killed by a Tyrannosaurus and regresses to a Skrull. The [[Hawkeye (comics)|Hawkeye]] from the ship is killed by Ronin and regresses to a Skrull. This causes the superheroes from the ship to scatter into the jungle. The New Avengers' Spider-Man is knocked away by a Tyrannosaurus and ends up confronting Ka-Zar, Shanna, Zabu, and Sauron as well as some of the other locals (ranging from the Sun People, the Swamp Men, and the Tree People). At the point where Spider-Man accuses Ka-Zar and Shanna for being Skrulls, the Captain America from the ship attacks who thinks the same thing for Spider-Man.&lt;ref&gt;''New Avengers'' #41&lt;/ref&gt; When the Captain America is hit by a dart coated in some type of poison, it regresses to a Skrull named Pit'o Nilli and is then killed by Shanna. The ship's [[Beast (comics)|Beast]] is trapped underground with [[Wonder Man]]. The two try to escape together, but Beast betrays Wonder Man as the two are about to return to the surface. During this, Iron Man uses an abandoned scientific facility nearby to try and recreate his original armor. When it came to the confrontation with both Avengers teams, the Savage Land natives, and the heroes from the ship, [[Mister Fantastic]] and Abigail Brand used a laser to identify the heroes from the ship as Skrulls. Ka-Zar joined the Avengers teams into fighting the Skrulls in New York while Shanna and the other Savage Land natives hunted down the remaining Skrulls hiding out in the Savage Land.

After the events of ''[[Second Coming (comics)|Second Coming]]'' during the ''[[Heroic Age (comics)|Heroic Age]]'' storyline, Cyclops takes some time off to go hunting in the Savage Land during which he encounters Steve Rogers. Steve Rogers suggests to Cyclops that he brings the X-Men out of the shadows and into the light as heroes. Steve Rogers also arranges to have the president award Scott the Presidential Medal of Freedom which sways the people of San Francisco to welcome the X-Men back.

Around the same time following their defeat after the hunt for "spiders" in the ''[[The Gauntlet and Grim Hunt|Grim Hunt]]'' storyline, the Kravinoff Family are also currently residing in the Savage Land.

It is later revealed that [[Miek]] and the other Imperials and Natives from Sakaar that came with Hulk back in ''[[World War Hulk]]'' had settled in the Savage Land constructing a village called New Imperia.&lt;ref&gt;''Incredible Hulk'' #622&lt;/ref&gt;

During the ''[[Avengers vs. X-Men]]'' storyline, Captain America ends up fighting Gambit in the Savage Land.&lt;ref&gt;''AVX Vs.'' #2&lt;/ref&gt;

As part of the ''[[Marvel NOW!]]'' event, some of The Garden's evolution seeds had fallen into the Savage Land. While working to get it under control, the Avengers find that A.I.M. is also there where they test the extracted formula from one of the pods and tests it on their intern Dr. Jema. The formula puts a strain on Dr. Jema just as the Avengers arrive.&lt;ref&gt;''Avengers'' Vol. 5 #4&lt;/ref&gt;

As part of the "[[All-New, All-Different Marvel]]", Magneto led a new team of X-Men to protect mutant-kind at all costs with their base in the Savage Land.&lt;ref&gt;''Uncanny X-Men'' Vol. 4#1-19&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conservational status==
The [[Marvel Universe]]'s version of the [[United Nations]] considers the Savage Land an international wildlife preserve and forbids any commercial exploitation of its resources.&lt;ref name="mnyc"&gt;{{cite book | last = Sanderson | first = Peter | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = ''The Marvel Comics Guide to New York City'' | publisher = [[Pocket Books]] | year = 2007 | location = New York City | pages = 64–73 | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = 1-4165-3141-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Savage Land races==
There are many types of races in the Savage Land and Pangea. The Nuwali transported primitive man now known as the Man-Apes, which unlike the rest of the world thrived until the 21st century. The next arrivals were the Ancient Atlanteans who added the region as part of their empire. They used the Nuwali technology to mutate the Man-Apes into various Beast-Men to perform certain tasks. These slaves rebelled after the great Cataclysm and made Pangea their home. Many Atlanteans remained and their decedents became the various human tribes, with some clinging to the old ways and technology but most forget and resort to more primitive [[hunter-gatherer]] societies. Among the Savage Land races are:

* '''Aerians''' – The Aerians are a race of [[List of avian humanoids|humanoids with large feathered wings]] which allow them to fly. Each member has a different color of skin and matching feathers (green, blue, orange, etc.). They are located in the city of Aerie Shalan which is located on a stone pillar high above Pangea. They are ruled by a technocracy, led by a chief scientist. Their technology advanced far beyond that of human scientists because they adapted and improved upon surviving antediluvian Atlantean technology. The Aerians became the principal allies of Ka-Zar and Shanna the She-Devil in Pangea, who aided them in their war with the Pterons.&lt;ref name="Ka-Zar Vol. 3 #2"&gt;''Ka-Zar'' Vol. 3 #2&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Ape-Men''' – The Ape-Men consist of all the species of upright [[ape]]s that developed into man. Each group lives in its own territory and has its own level of technology. The most advanced species of Ape-Man (the [[Neanderthal]]s) are the most dominant human race of the Savage Land and are capable of bringing down even the largest of dinosaurs.&lt;ref&gt;''Amazing Adventures'' #3&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Awakilius''' – The Awakilius are a tribe of [[Pygmy peoples|pygmies]] that live in the Savage Land and are descended from the immigrants that came from Africa. Ka-Zar and Shanna the She-Devil prevented the Awakilius chief from sacrificing a Lemuran.&lt;ref&gt;''Ka-Zar'' Vol. 3 #16&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Bhadwuans''' – The Bhadwuans are a society of advanced people that live in the Savage Land that are the supposed descendants of the Atlanteans. They specialize in magic, they can fly, and they can discharge energy when they act in unison. The live in the mystical realm of Bhadwuan and watched the Earth for a millennium. Some Bhadwuans wanted to change the Savage Land's environment only for them to be stopped by Ka-Zar.&lt;ref name="Ka-Zar Vol. 4 #1"/&gt;
* '''Cat People''' – The Cat People are a nomadic [[cat]]-like race that dwell in Pandori, Pangea and in the periphery of the Lemuran society. They are a [[hunter-gatherer]] society. The Cat People worship and kill the [[Smilodon]]s and other big cats that live in the Savage Land. These Cat People are much different from the [[Cat People (comics)|Cat People]] that are associated with [[Tigra]].&lt;ref&gt;''Ka-Zar'' #1&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Cliff Forest People''' – The Cliff Forest People are a tribe of humans that live on a steep cliff in the Savage Land. They were allied with the Durammi against an unnamed barbarian tribe.&lt;ref name="Savage Tales #10"&gt;''Savage Tales'' #10&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Dissians''' – The Dissians (also known as the '''Children of Dis''') are underground yellow-skinned humanoids who are the descendants of the Dante's Crew. They reside in the underground city of Belasco beneath the Savage Land. Some Dissians can emit bursts of energy from their eyes.&lt;ref&gt;''Ka-Zar'' Vol. 3 #11&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Durammi''' – The Durammi are a tribe of humans that live in a peaceful valley within the Savage Land. They were allied with the Cliff Forest People against an unnamed barbarian tribe.&lt;ref name="Savage Tales #10"/&gt;
* '''Ethereals''' – The Ethereals are a race of advanced humanoids that were genetically enhanced by the Nuwali thousands of years ago. Until recently, they were considered to be mythical by the other tribes of the Savage Land. They are culturally arrogant and hostile to outsiders.&lt;ref&gt;''Ka-Zar'' Vol. 5 #2&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Fall People''' – The Fall People are a hunter-gatherer tribe that live in villages, and are led by a chieftain. Their appearance and culture were similar to the [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]]. Ka-Zar was very friendly with the Fall People, and their chieftain Tongah was his best friend. Most of the Fall People were killed in attacks by the Sun People and the extraterrestrial Quarlians. The Fall People later befriended the X-Men. The Fall People are a strong faction in the United Tribes.&lt;ref name="Astonishing Tales #3"/&gt;
* '''Golden People''' – The Golden People are a race of yellow-skinned humans that reside in the Savage Land. They are the descendants of the Gortokians of [[Subterranea (comics)|Subterranea]]. They are longtime allies of Ka-Zar and have salvaged Atlantean technology.&lt;ref name="Marvel Super-Heroes Vol. 2 #19"&gt;''Marvel Super-Heroes'' Vol. 2 #19&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Gondorans''' – The Gondorans are a tribe of humans that inhabit Gondora, a city in a dormant volcano. It was ruled by a God-Man whose actual name was Montgomery Ford, a rogue scientist from the outside world. He used technology to build the city and rule with an iron fist.

* '''Gorankians''' – The Gorankians are a race of gray-skinned, [[ape]]-like, semi-intelligent, humanoid creatures with small tusks coming from their lower jaw, pointed ears, and surprisingly small amount of hair. They are tribal in nature and led by Etuban. The Gorankians are a hunter-gatherer society and are long-time enemies of the Uruburians. Ka-Zar helped settle their dispute by having them play different games which includes [[baseball]] in order to prevent an all-out war.&lt;ref name="Ka-Zar Vol. 3 #1"&gt;''Ka-Zar'' Vol. 3 #1&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Gwundas''' – The Gwundas are a race of primitive humans that live in the Savage Land. They are a hunter-gatherer society. Ka-Zar once saved their tribe from a Tyrannosaurus that they accidentally unleashed.&lt;ref name="Ka-Zar Vol. 3 #1"/&gt;
* '''Hauk'kas''' – The Hauk'kas are a race of Saurians that evolved from dinosaurs the same time way that humanity has evolved from apes. The Hauk'kas possess technology, culture, and civilization that rivals the human race. The Hauk'kas have a good knowledge of the superhuman side of the human race. A council of older Saurians serve as the leaders of the Hauk'kas. The X-Men first encountered the Hauk'kas when investigating the mysterious resurrection of Psylocke at the same time when the Hauk'kas were capturing the Saurians that the X-Men once helped to emigrate to the Savage Land. The Hauk'kas are currently on neutral terms with the human race.&lt;ref&gt;''Uncanny X-Men'' #445&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Hill-Forest People''' – The Hill-Forest People are a race of primitive humans that live in the Savage Land. They are an agricultural tribe when they stumbled upon a capsule containing Grond of Gondwanaland (who was placed in suspended animation by his creators).

* '''Jeriens''' – The Jeriens are a race of humanoid [[Pterosaur]]-like creatures that live in the Savage Land.&lt;ref&gt;''Ka-Zar'' Vol. 3 #20&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Kantos''' – The Kantos are a race of primitive humans that live near an underground river.&lt;ref name="Savage Tales #8"/&gt;
* '''Karems''' – The Karems are a race of primitive humans that live in the Savage Land. They are a hunter-gatherer society. Many of the Karem were abducted by the Nuwali and [[Plunderer (character)|Plunderer]] using the Motyka Bone (a teleportation bone that was lost for centuries), but were rescued by Ka-Zar and Shanna the She-Devil.&lt;ref&gt;''Ka-Zar'' Vol. 3 #32&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Klantorrs''' – The Klantorrs are a race of Saurian-like beings with [[Pterosaur]]-like wings that inhabit the forest-country surrounding Palandor. They have a taste for human flesh. Possibly resulted from the genetic tinkering of the ancient Atlanteans just like the genetic tinkering that resulted in the creations of the Aerians and Pterons. They have occasionally hunted the Palandorians.&lt;ref name="Savage Tales #9"&gt;''Savage Tales'' #9&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Lemurans''' – The Lemurans are a society of humans that inhabit Lemura, an area of the section of Pangea known as Zarhan. Their level of technology is the same as [[England in the Middle Ages|Medieval England]]. These humans are strongly loyal to their monarchy. The Lemurans were longtime allies of the Pterons.&lt;ref name="Ka-Zar Vol. 3 #1"/&gt;
* '''[[List of reptilian humanoids|Lizard Men]]''' – The Lizard Man are a [[lizard]]-like race that were one of the Beast-Men created by the Ancient Atlanteans. There had been two different Lizard Men that lived in the Savage Land where they are much different from the Lizard Men of [[Subterranea (comics)|Subterranea]] and the Lizard Men of Tok (from the Microverse).
** '''Lizard Men of Vala Kuri''' – The first group of Lizard Men are a hunter-gatherer society and reside in the city of Vala Kuri. The Lizard Men of Vala Kuri are peaceful in nature. They are protected from the Sun People by Ka-Zar and Garokk. They have ancestors in the Reptile Men and the Waidians.&lt;ref name="Astonishing Tales #3"&gt;''Astonishing Tales'' #3&lt;/ref&gt;
** '''Queen Iranda's Lizard Men''' –  The second group of the Lizard Men were actually a group of mystically-altered humans that went missing from their village and turned into Lizard Men by Queen Iranda. When Ka-Zar comes to their aid, he barely escapes them and manages to escape with Queen Iranda's crown which regressed Queen Iranda back to a lizard and the Lizard Men back to their human forms.&lt;ref&gt;''Astonishing Tales'' #8&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Locot''' – The Locots are a society of hunter-gatherers that have been at war with the Noweks.&lt;ref name="Incredible Hulk #454"&gt;''Incredible Hulk'' Vol. 2 #454&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Man-Apes''' – The Man-Apes are tribal, highly primitive cave-dwelling humanoids that resemble [[Neanderthal]]s. These savage creatures were the first humanoid beings native to Earth to inhabit the Savage Land. Atlantean scientists used Man-Apes as subjects in the experiments by which they created the various non-human races of the Savage Land. The members of the Man-Ape known as Maa-Gor's tribe are said to have been the last living Man-Apes in the Savage Land. Ka-Zar killed all the male Man-Apes of Maa-Gor's tribe except for Maa-Gor himself. It seems likely that the Man-Apes are the only remaining humanoids on Earth that haven't had their genome tampered with, like the other races in Savage Land or like the humans in the outside world were experimented with by the Celestials.&lt;ref name="X-Men #10"&gt;''X-Men'' #10&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''N'Galans''' – The N'Galans are humanoid dinosaurs with possible links to the Lizard-Men and are a hunter-gatherer society. Most are highly superstitious.

The Nhu'Gari once allied with Magneto. Their city was later destroyed by volcanic upheavals.&lt;ref&gt;''X-Men: The Hidden Years'' #2&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Nowek''' – The Noweks are a society of hunters and gatherers that have been at war against the tribes that are less developed.&lt;ref name="Incredible Hulk #454"/&gt;
* '''Palandorians''' – The Palandorians are a tribe of humans that live on an island surrounded by a lake in the original Savage Land. They live in the city of Palandor and ride giant [[lizard]]s. Their culture likely derives form ancient Atlantis (same as the Lemurans). The Palandorians were often preyed upon by the Klantorrs. During the reign of Queen Omel, the Palandorians performed human sacrifices which ceased when a mutated Apatosaurus destroyed the temple which killed Queen Omel.&lt;ref name="Savage Tales #9"/&gt;
* '''Pterons''' – The Pterons greatly resemble humanoid Pteranodons, and have the ability to fly with their enormous wings. They inhabit the caverns of Athmeth beneath Pangea. They are ruled by their king Khalf. The Pterons launched a war against the Aerians which ended with the deaths of much of the Pteron race in a cave-in.&lt;ref name="Ka-Zar Vol. 3 #2"/&gt;
* '''Reptile Men''' – The Reptile Men are a race of green-skinned Saurians that reside in the marshes of the Savage Land. They are a hunter and gatherer society. When the alien Quor crash-landed on Earth and encountered the Reptile Men, he convinced them to make him their leader and provided them with advanced technology. The Reptile Men started to plunder the Vibranium deposits of the other tribes like the Golden People which attracted the attention of Ka-Zar. Once Ka-Zar managed to defeat Quor with the help of the Golden People, the Reptile Men retreated.&lt;ref name="Marvel Super-Heroes Vol. 2 #19"/&gt;
* '''Rock Tribe''' – The Rock Tribe are a group of stone-like humanoids.
* '''Saurians''' – The Saurians (also known as "The People") were originally [[lizard]]s that were exposed to the first nuclear bomb test in New Mexico. It took them awhile for them to evolve and they built an underground city. They did have an encounter with [[Carol Danvers|Ms. Marvel]] when she discovered their underground city. When the [[Dire Wraith]]s attacked, the Saurians encountered [[Rom (comics)|Rom]]. The Saurian survivors hid from the humans until they later learned of the Savage Land. The Saurians were spotted by some people when traveling through Argentina and were rescued by the X-Men who helped them get to the Savage Land. They became part of the United Tribes at the time when the Savage Land Mutates attacked. Sometime later, the Saurians were captured by the Hauk'ka yet were rescued by the X-Men.&lt;ref&gt;''Ms. Marvel'' #20&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Snowmen''' – The Snowmen lived on the high steppes of Pangea and resemble [[Yeti]]-like creatures. They are a hunter-gatherer society. Ka-Zar and Shanna the She-Devil encountered two of them channeling the lava from Mt. Flavius.&lt;ref&gt;''Ka-Zar'' Vol. 3 #28&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Sun People''' – The Sun People control the Sun Empire, formerly ruled by their priestess-queen Zaladane. They were the most powerful grouping of sentient beings within the Savage Land and they established a small empire through conquest. They conquered in the name of their sun god Garokk. Although the Sun People were depicted as green-skinned in Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe #19 (December 1987), they are in fact indistinguishable from ordinary Caucasians (see Zaladane). The cited Handbook entry in fact erroneously depicted a Sheenarian, member of an extradimensional race who once invaded the Savage Land (first seen in Ka-Zar: Lord of the Hidden Jungle #14). During the ''[[Secret Invasion]]'' storyline, the Sun People were depicted among Ka-Zar's allies in his fight against the Skrulls, presumably as a result of the aforementioned error being used as reference.&lt;ref name="Astonishing Tales #3"/&gt;
* '''Swamp Men''' – The Swamp Men are humanoids covered head to toe in hair that live in the swamplands of the Savage Land. These tribal people have a level of technology comparable to that of Europe's Dark Ages, ride giant [[bird]]s, and are highly skilled in devising weaponry. They are continual enemies of Ka-Zar. The Swamp Men long worshipped Umbu the Unliving, a gigantic robot constructed by the alien Saggitarians. The Savage Land Mutates are Swamp Men who Magneto subjected to mutation by artificial means. During the ''[[Secret Invasion]]'' storyline, some of the Swamp Men joined Ka-Zar in his fight against the Skrulls.&lt;ref name="X-Men #10"/&gt;
* '''Sylandans''' – The Sylandans are a society of humans that are descendants of the ancient Atlanteans. They live in Sylanda, a city of glass located in the Savage Land's Mountain of Darkness. They cling to their Atlantean ways as their level of technology is high. The Sylandans use the Water of Life to cure all diseases and used it to treat the people of the Savage Land for centuries. Their city was later damaged by a large dinosaur.&lt;ref&gt;''Savage Tales'' #7&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Tandar-Kaans''' – The Tandar-Kaans are a tribe of people that live in the Savage Land. They are expert [[Shipbuilding|ship builders]] and [[Fisherman|fishermen]]. They formed a community of barges on the river Tabar allowing them to move to new shores when they want to.&lt;ref&gt;''Ka-Zar'' Vol. 2 #6&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Tokchis''' – The Tokchis have not yet been seen in the comics yet have been mentioned a lot. They are mentioned to be a human society of hunters and gatherers that use walkie-talkies. Ka-Zar formed an alliance with them to coordinate efforts to hunt.&lt;ref name="Ka-Zar Vol. 3 #2"/&gt;
* '''Tordon-Naans''' – The Tordon-Naans inhabit a city called Tordon-Naa in a secluded valley deep in the Savage Land behind the "curtain of gods' tears." They worship the god Ilaka-Aron and their beliefs were manipulated Sylitha who sought greater power. The Tordon-Naans are a lost [[Hindu]] colony as their culture closely resembles that of ancient India.&lt;ref&gt;''Ka-Zar'' Vol. 2 #10&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Tree People''' – The Tree People are a race that looks much like humans though they have long, prehensile [[monkey]]-like tails. They live in Botor (a treetop village in Pangea) and are a hunter-gatherer society. Shanna the She-Devil was briefly married to one of the Tree People named Mele. During the ''[[Secret Invasion]]'' storyline, some of the Tree People joined Ka-Zar in his fight against the Skrulls.&lt;ref&gt;''Ka-Zar'' Vol. 3 #13&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Tribe of Fire''' – The Tribe of Fire is a tribe of humans that live in the Savage Land. They are a hunter and gatherer society. Some of the tribe members were used in an experiment conducted by an Apocalypse robot until it was destroyed by Wolverine. The [[cyborg]]s from these experiments joined the Tribe of Fire.&lt;ref&gt;''Wolverine: Jungle Adventures'' #1&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Tubanti''' – The Tubantis are a race of [[List of piscine and amphibian humanoids|fish people]] that dwell in Pangea's inland Gorahn Sea. They briefly served the demon Belasco when he tried to conquer the Savage Land. The Tubantis are allies with the Lemurans and the other races of the Savage Land.&lt;ref&gt;''Ka-Zar'' Vol. 3 #30&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Uruburians''' – The Uruburians are a race of unspecified humanoid beasts with fangs that live in the Savage Land as a hunter-gatherer tribe. The Uruburians are long-time enemies of the Gorankians. Ka-Zar helped settle their dispute by having them play different games which includes baseball in order to prevent an all-out war.&lt;ref name="Ka-Zar Vol. 3 #1"/&gt;
* '''Waidians''' – The Waidians are a race of green-skinned Saurians that live in the Savage Land. They are a hunter and gatherer society and are very peaceful. When Ka-Zar was a teenager, he was trained by the wise Waidian [[Wise old man|sage]] named Benazu.&lt;ref name="Ka-Zar Vol. 4 #1"/&gt;

* '''[[Zebra]] People''' – The Zebra People are swamp dwellers and are also known as the Swamp Tribe. They are a racially integrated society made of up both white and black people, who wear makeup over their body in the form of zebra-like stripes. White Zebra People wear black stripes and black Zebra People wear white stripes. The Zebra People are known to ride dinosaurs that they have domesticated.&lt;ref name="Ka-Zar Vol. 2 #12"&gt;''Ka-Zar'' Vol. 2 #12&lt;/ref&gt;
** '''Lizard People''' – There is also a rogue faction of the Zebra People called the Lizard People which wore reptilian armor and worked for Zaur and Sheeas the Witch. Zaur and those that were members of the Lizard People returned to the Zebra People after the death of Sheeas the Witch. Of course some of them may have preserved the traditions of the Lizard People.&lt;ref name="Ka-Zar Vol. 2 #12"/&gt;

==Other versions==
===Age of Apocalypse===
In the ''[[Age of Apocalypse]]'' reality, the Savage Land houses Avalon, a secret haven for humans and mutants. A method to reach it exists, but it will only cost the refugee everything they own and even then, there is no guarantee of arriving alive. It is led by [[Destiny (Irene Adler)|Destiny]], a pacifist [[Juggernaut (comics)|Juggernaut]] and [[Cypher (comics)|Douglas Ramsey]], the latter of whom provides a field that allows everybody to understand each other despite speaking different languages. Avalon was eventually found by Apocalypse forces and destroyed by the [[Shadow King]] who mind-controlled its inhabitants into killing each other. He was defeated, but casualties were high.

===Age of Ultron===
During the ''[[Age of Ultron]]'' storyline, the superhero resistance against [[Ultron]] had relocated to the Savage Land to come up with a plan to defeat Ultron.&lt;ref&gt;''Age of Ultron'' #4&lt;/ref&gt;

===Marvel Zombies Return===
In ''[[Marvel Zombies Return]]'', the Savage Land, like everywhere else on Earth, has been eaten by the superhuman zombies, with the surviving zombies musing that the Savage Land was their 'number one' meal in the aftermath, as it contained such an abundance of food that they were actually full for a full hour after eating there, as opposed to the usual ravenous hunger they feel. It is also the location of the final battle between the zombies and 'New Avengers'- three zombies who have beaten their hunger and the cyborg James Rhodes- at the storyline's conclusion, with Rhodes using one of his fingers to lure the zombies into an ambush.

===Earth X===
In the ''[[Earth X]]'' universe, the Savage Land is where Magneto built his sanctuary called Sentinel City.

===House of M===
In the ''[[House of M]]'' reality created by an insane Scarlet Witch, the Savage Land was known as "Pangea." It is also known that Kevin Plunder has been granted political asylum in the United States for his human rights activism in this prehistoric land.

===Marvel 2099===
In the alternate future depicted in [[Marvel 2099]], an alien attack floods much of the earth rendering the Savage Land the only habitable space. Thousands of refugees (including [[Spider-Man 2099|Miguel O'Hara]] and most of [[X-Nation 2099|X-Nation]] and [[X-Men 2099|X-Men]]) make new homes here. It is not without its own dangers.

===The Transformers===
In the ''[[The Transformers (Marvel Comics)|Transformers]]'' Marvel comics continuity, shortly after the ''[[Ark (Transformers)|Ark]]''' spacecraft crashed on Earth 4 million years before the present day, the computer aboard the Ark detected [[Shockwave (Transformers)|Shockwave]] landing on the prehistoric Savage Land. The ''Ark'' used the last of its capabilities to revive the five [[Autobot]] warriors by scanning the Savage Land's dominant lifeform: dinosaurs, and rebuild them into the [[Dinobots]]. The Dinobots fought Shockwave, a battle that ended in permanent stalemate when [[Snarl (Transformers)|Snarl]] brought down the mountain that Shockwave stood upon, knocking all of them into a tar pit. They remained deactivated until the year 1984. Since the Dinobots' alt-mode forms resemble creatures that were long-extinct by 4 million years ago, the Savage Land provided author [[Simon Furman]] a way to explain this within the canon timeline.

===Ultimate Marvel===
In the [[Ultimate Marvel]] universe, the Savage Land is a large island somewhere in the southern hemisphere. It was originally said to have been created by [[Magneto (comics)|Magneto]], using theories and methods developed by [[Professor X]], as the site for genetic experiments. Magneto's goal there was to create a new human race who would be less trouble to rule than the current one, that he decided to restart evolution from scratch, and control the process to his own specifications. As a result of this, at its current level of advancement, it has dinosaurs and that Magneto has shown no further interest in advancing the evolution of the Savage Land. It has remained in its dinosaur state since the departure of Professor X. This story is later revealed as false (see below).

Magneto's original base was on the Savage Land. When it was destroyed in the first arc of ''[[Ultimate X-Men]]'', the computer controlling the base gained self-awareness, and hijacked the genetic experiment project to create an army of [[Phalanx (comics)|nanotech-enhanced, zombie-like thralls]]. It planned to take over the world, but was stopped by [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]], [[Cyclops (Marvel Comics)|Cyclops]], and [[Kitty Pryde]].

The Savage Land is now the home of [[Longshot (Marvel Comics)|Longshot]], who managed to get there in a small boat which launched from [[Genosha]]. Longshot recently aided Magneto in breaking out of prison, and the two may be planning something.

In ''[[Ultimates]] 3'', it is revealed that the dinosaurs were conjured by [[Scarlet Witch]] as a result of her reality warping abilities and not by Magneto's creation. The aboriginal inhabitants were wiped out and only a small tribe of survivors including Ka-Zar and Shanna remain.

The inhabitants help the Ultimates remove the last of Magneto's forces as of ''[[Ultimatum (Ultimate Marvel)|Ultimatum]]''.

===What If?===
The Savage Land appears in a ''[[What If (comics)|What If]]'' story where the Savage Land was terraforming and has taken over New York. Both Ka-Zar and Parnival sacrifice themselves to return New York to normal, with Shanna the only survivor of his "family."&lt;ref&gt;''What If?'' Vol. 2 #112&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, in the ''What If'' issues involving alternative outcomes to the Age of Ultron, a group composed of Wolverine, the Hulk, Peter Parker and a Ghost Rider venture to the Savage Land in order to prevent a [[Master Mold]] under the control of a future version of [[Zeke Stane|Ezekiel Stane]] from unleashing a wave of Stark armors on the world.&lt;ref&gt;''What If? Age of Ultron'' #2&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Silurians''' are a fictional race of [[Reptilian humanoid|reptile-like humanoids]] in the long-running British [[science fiction television]] series ''[[Doctor Who]]''. The species first appeared in ''Doctor Who'' in the 1970 serial ''[[Doctor Who and the Silurians]]'', and were created by [[Malcolm Hulke]]. The first Silurians introduced are depicted as prehistoric and scientifically advanced sentient humanoids who predate [[Human evolution|the dawn of man]]; in their backstory, the Silurians went into self-induced hibernation to survive what they predicted to be a large atmospheric upheaval caused by the Earth capturing the [[Moon]]. The Silurians introduced in the 1970 story are broad, three-eyed land-dwellers. The 1972 serial ''[[The Sea Devils]]'', also by Hulke, introduced their amphibious cousins, the so-called "Sea Devils". Both Silurians and Sea Devils made an appearance in 1984's ''[[Warriors of the Deep]]''. After ''Warriors of the Deep'', the Silurians did not appear in the show again before its 1989 cancellation. Heavily redesigned Silurans were reintroduced to the series in 2010, following the show's 2005 revival, and have recurred frequently since then.

[[File:Silurian2.jpg|thumb|left|An original-style Silurian, in ''Doctor Who and the Silurians''.]]
Drawing on the ideas of the [[Bernard Quatermass|Quatermass]] serials, producer [[Peter Bryant]] and producer and script editor [[Derrick Sherwin]] decided that for the series' [[Doctor Who (season 7)|seventh season]], the show's [[protagonist]] [[The Doctor (Doctor Who)|the Doctor]] should be restricted to contemporary Earth and work alongside the [[UNIT]] organisation, featured prominently in the [[Doctor Who (season 6)|sixth season]]'s serial ''[[The Invasion (Doctor Who)|The Invasion]]''. Producer [[Barry Letts]] and script editor [[Terrance Dicks]], inheriting this new vision for the series, also wanted their stories for the seventh season to have a serious, deeper subtext. They approached [[Malcolm Hulke]], co-writer of the [[Patrick Troughton]] serials ''[[The Faceless Ones]]'' (1967) and ''[[The War Games]]'' (1969), to write a serial for this new season.&lt;ref name="unit family"&gt;{{cite AV media |people=[[Nicholas Courtney|Courtney, Nicholas]]; [[Terrance Dicks|Dicks, Terrance]]; [[Caroline John|John, Caroline]]; [[Barry Letts|Letts, Barry]]; [[John Levene|Levene, John]]; [[Derrick Sherwin|Sherwin, Derrick]]; [[Derek Ware (actor)|Ware, Derek]] |date=2006 |title=The U.N.I.T Family part one |trans-title= |medium= |language= |url= |access-date= |archive-url= |archive-date= |format=DVD |time= |location= |publisher=[[BBC Worldwide]] |id=BBCDVD3671 |isbn= |oclc= |quote= |ref= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hulke saw limitations with this earthbound format&amp;nbsp;– he believed there would be two types of stories, one featuring mad scientists and the other alien invasions. Terrance Dicks claims credit for thinking of the idea of creatures that had been there all along;&lt;ref name="unit family"/&gt; however, other sources{{citation needed|date=May 2016}} give Hulke credit for deliberately thinking his way outside his earlier preconceptions.

While planning stories for ''Doctor Who'''s [[Doctor Who (season 9)|ninth season]], Dicks and Letts decided to revive the Silurian concept, this time with the twist of these new Silurians originating in the sea. Originally dubbed "Sea Silurians", they were rechristened "Sea Devils" for dramatic effect as Hulke's storyline was edited.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media |people=Cann, David; [[Michael E.

[[Johnny Byrne (writer)|Johnny Byrne]], writer of the [[Peter Davison]] serial ''[[Warriors of the Deep]]'' (1984), notes that the Myrka creature was created to absolve the Silurians from the guilt of genocide, using the creature as a weapon of last resort.

==Appearances==

===Television===
In their first appearance in ''[[Doctor Who and the Silurians]]'' (1970), a group of Silurians are awakened from [[suspended animation|hibernation]] by the energy from a nearby nuclear power research center in Derbyshire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.radiotimes.com/blog/2009-09-21/doctor-who-and-the-silurians |title=Doctor Who and the Silurians ***** |last1=Braxton |first1=Mark |last2= |first2= |date=21 September 2009 |website=[[Radio Times]] |publisher= |access-date=21 January 2017 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Third Doctor]] ([[Jon Pertwee]]) initially manages to negotiate an honourable compromise with the colony's leader. Unfortunately, the colony's leader is murdered by a younger Silurian who becomes the new leader, intent on a far more aggressive policy. To that end, the Silurians then attempt to reclaim the planet from humanity by releasing a deadly virus and attempting to disperse the [[Van Allen radiation belt]]. Both plans were thwarted by the Doctor. Despite the Doctor's best efforts to broker a peaceful solution, the Silurians are still determined to exterminate humanity, only to have their base destroyed by the fictional organisation [[UNIT]] on the orders of [[Brigadier Lethbridge-Stewart]] ([[Nicholas Courtney]]) to preempt this open threat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite serial |title=Doctor Who and the Silurians |title-link=Doctor Who and the Silurians |episode= |url= |series=Doctor Who |series-link=Doctor Who |first=Malcolm (writer) |last=Hulke |author-link=Malcolm Hulke |first2=Timothy (director) |last2=Combe |author-link2=Timothy Combe |credits= |network=[[BBC]] |station=[[BBC1]] |date=31 January – 14 March 1970 |number= |minutes= |transcript= |transcripturl=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Doctor Who 50th Celebration (11278505066).jpg|thumb|right|The Sea Devils, shown at a 50th Anniversary event.]]
In ''The Sea Devils'' (1972), an amphibious variety of Silurians are awakened from their hibernation by a renegade [[Time Lord]] known as [[The Master (Doctor Who)|the Master]] ([[Roger Delgado]]), who persuades them to reclaim the planet from the human race. Despite the Third Doctor's efforts to convince them otherwise, the Sea Devils eventually decide to go to war, forcing the Doctor to destroy their base. It is revealed, however, that there were many colonies still in hibernation around the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite serial |title=The Sea Devils |title-link=The Sea Devils |episode= |url= |series=Doctor Who |series-link=Doctor Who |first=Malcolm (writer) |last=Hulke |author-link=Malcolm Hulke |first2=Michael (director) |last2=Briant |author-link2=Michael E.

Set in the year 2084 during a prolonged "[[Cold war (general term)|cold war]]" between factions of humanity, the serial describes the Sea Devils as being elite warriors; they sport bulletproof samurai-style armour. The [[Fifth Doctor]] ([[Peter Davison]]) tries in vain to prevent any bloodshed against either species; he tells companions [[Tegan Jovanka|Tegan]] ([[Janet Fielding]]) and [[Vislor Turlough|Turlough]] ([[Mark Strickson]]) to give the Silurians oxygen to keep them safe from the hexachromite gas he released into the base's atmosphere. The last surviving Silurian in the episode, however, is killed by Turlough, leaving the Doctor despondent.

Silurians are reintroduced to the series, following its cancellation and revival, in the 2010 two-parter "[[The Hungry Earth]]" / "[[Cold Blood (Doctor Who)|Cold Blood]]", in which Silurians are awoken in 2020 by an underground drilling operation. These Silurians lack the third eye of their 1970–1984 counterparts, and wear masks. Having misinterpreted the drilling as a deliberate attack, the Silurians take hostages. After a protracted conflict, the [[Eleventh Doctor]] ([[Matt Smith (actor)|Matt Smith]]) leaves behind two humans in the Silurian city to act as ambassadors to the human race when the Silurians re-awaken in a thousand years.&lt;ref name="the hungry earth"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite episode |title=Cold Blood |episode-link=Cold Blood (Doctor Who) |url= |access-date= |series=Doctor Who |series-link=Doctor Who |first=Chris (writer) |last=Chibnall |author-link=Chris Chibnall |first2=Ashley (director) |last2=Way |author-link2=Ashley Way |network=[[BBC]] |station=[[BBC One]] |date=29 May 2010 |season= |series-no=5 |number=9 |minutes= |time= |transcript= |transcript-url= |quote= |language=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In "[[The Pandorica Opens]]" (2010), some Silurians appear in A.D. 102 alongside various alien enemies of the Doctor (including alien [[Dalek]]s, [[Sontaran]]s, [[Auton|Nestenes]] and other species) to imprison the Doctor in the mythical "Pandorica" in order, as they see it, to save the universe from him.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite episode |title=The Pandorica Opens |episode-link=The Pandorica Opens |url= |access-date= |series=Doctor Who |series-link=Doctor Who |first=Steven (writer) |last=Moffat |author-link=Steven Moffat |first2=Toby (director) |last2=Haynes |author-link2=Toby Haynes |network=[[BBC]] |station=[[BBC One]] |date=19 June 2010 |season= |series-no=5 |number=12 |minutes= |time= |transcript= |transcript-url= |quote= |language=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Recurring character [[Madame Vastra, Jenny Flint, and Strax|Madame Vastra]] ([[Neve McIntosh]]) is then introduced in "[[A Good Man Goes to War]]" (2011) as a Silurian detective in the Victorian era, who befriended the Doctor after a brief rampage on the London Underground.

In "The Crimson Horror", Vastra claims to be from 65 million years ago.

Silurians are mentioned in the 2011 ''[[Torchwood: Miracle Day]]'' episode "[[The Blood Line]]" (2011); [[Jack Harkness]] ([[John Barrowman]]) briefly muses that the Blessing (an ancient phenomenon beneath the Earth's surface) could be out of "Silurian mythology".

A Silurian doctor named Malohkeh (played by [[Richard Hope (actor)|Richard Hope]]) is seen attending to [[Winston Churchill]] ([[Ian McNeice]]) in "[[The Wedding of River Song]]" in an aborted timeline. Hope plays another Silurian in "[[Dinosaurs on a Spaceship]]" (2012), seen briefly on a computer screen. The titular spaceship is a Silurian Ark searching for a new planet with a cargo of [[dinosaur]]s, the Silurian colony on board having been ejected from the ship by Solomon ([[David Bradley (English actor)|David Bradley]]) prior to the episode. The ship is shown to have reached a planet named Siluria with its dinosaurs at the episode's conclusion.

In "[[The Time of the Doctor]]" (2013), many Silurian Arks are seen among the ships gathered round Trenzalore.

===Literature===
All of the Silurian stories on television prior to 2010 were [[novelization|novelised]]. The novelisation of ''Doctor Who and the Silurians'', ''Doctor Who and the Cave-Monsters'' (1974) adds a prologue which features the beginning of the Silurians' hibernation; the novelisation avoids referring to the reptiles as Silurians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Hulke |first=Malcolm |author-link=Malcolm Hulke |date=17 January 1974 |title=Doctor Who and the Cave-Monsters |title-link=Doctor Who and the Silurians#In print |series=[[List of Doctor Who novelisations|''Doctor Who'' novelisations]] |location= |publisher=[[Target Books]] |page= |isbn=978-0-426-10292-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Terrance Dicks]]' novelisation of ''Warriors of the Deep'' (1984) describes Icthar, the sole survivor of the Silurian Triad, as a survivor of the Silurian colony in the caves near the nuclear research facility from ''Doctor Who and the Silurians''; according to this book, the Silurians were only sealed away, not destroyed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Dicks |first=Terrance |author-link=Terrance Dicks |orig-year=1984 |date=1985 |title=Warriors of the Deep |title-link=Warriors of the Deep#In print |series=[[List of Doctor Who novelisations|''Doctor Who'' novelisations]] |location=London |publisher=[[Target Books]] |pages=45; 58; 102 |isbn=0 426 19561 2}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Seventh Doctor]] [[Virgin New Adventures]] novel ''[[Blood Heat]]'' (1993), Silurians of an [[Parallel universe (fiction)|alternate reality]] have conquered Earth after the Third Doctor was killed in their initial appearance, with the Seventh Doctor eventually forcing the humans and Silurians of this world into a truce.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Mortimore |first=Jim |author-link=Jim Mortimore |date=October 1993 |title=Blood Heat |title-link=Blood Heat |series=[[Virgin New Adventures]] |location= |publisher=[[Virgin Books]] |page= |isbn=978-0-426-20399-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Contradicting the ''Warriors of the Deep'' novelisation, the novel ''[[The Scales of Injustice]]'' (1996) mentions that Icthar's shelter awoke forty years before the events of ''Doctor Who and the Silurians'', and that the shelter is located on the other side of the world to the British Isles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Russell |first=Gary |author-link=Gary Russell |orig-year=1996 |date=2014 |title=The Scales of Injustice: The Monster Collection Edition |title-link=The Scales of Injustice |series=[[Virgin Missing Adventures]] |location= |publisher=[[BBC Books]] |page=96 |isbn=978 1 849 90780 4}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''The Scales of Injustice'', the power-hungry Silurian Auggi plans to eradicate humanity, beginning with an invasion fleet of Silurian hybrids on the Kent coast.

===Comics===
The Silurians also make a number of appearance in comic books. Comic book story "Twilight of the Silurians" (1980) is set during the species' last days pre-hibernation, where Silurians observe captive "ape-men" in their zoological research station, millions of years ago.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite comic | writer = [[Steve Moore (comics)|Moore, Steve]] | artist = [[David Lloyd (comics)|Lloyd, David]] | story = Twilight of the Silurians | title = [[Doctor Who Magazine|Doctor Who Weekly]] | volume = | issue = #21–22 | date = 5–12 March 1980 | publisher = [[Marvel UK]] | location = London | page = | panel = | id = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The comic book "City of Devils" (1983) features two ''Doctor Who'' companions, journalist [[Sarah Jane Smith]] and robot dog [[K-9 (Doctor Who)|K-9]] uncover a hidden city of Silurians (here, 'Eocenes') in an Egyptian archaeological dig, who seek peaceful coexistence with humans; this comic strip is based on the premise of the television spin-off special ''[[K9 and Company]]''. In the story arc "Final Genesis" (1993), an alternate universe is depicted wherein Silurians made peace with humanity and the two races live in harmony; UNIT is renamed URIC, the 'United Races Intelligence Command'. In the ''[[Doctor Who Magazine]]'' comic strip cycle "The Cybermen" (1994–1996), the cyborg race of [[Cyberman|Cybermen]] discover Silurians and Sea Devils living on their own planet [[Mondas (Doctor Who)|Mondas]] during an unspecified time in the past; in ''Doctor Who'', Mondas is Earth's former "twin planet". The strip also portrays Golgoth, a primordial humanoid reptile god-figure, who resembles a Sea Devil and may have some link to the Silurians. [[Madame Vastra, Jenny Flint, and Strax|Madame Vastra]] co-stars in the ''Doctor Who Magazine'' comic strip "The Crystal Throne" (2014).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite comic | writer = [[Scott Gray (writer)|Gray, Scott]] | artist = [[Mike Collins (comics)|Collins, Mike]] | coartists = [[David Roach (comics)|David A Roach]] | story = The Crystal Throne | title = [[Doctor Who Magazine]] | volume = | issue = #475–476 | date = August – September 2014 | publisher = [[Panini Comics|Panini UK Ltd]] | location = Tunbridge Wells | page = | panel = | id = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Audio drama===
Silurians also feature in the [[Big Finish Productions]] audio play ''[[Bloodtide (audio drama)|Bloodtide]]'' (2001), in which the [[Sixth Doctor]] intervenes when [[Charles Darwin]] and the [[HMS Beagle|HMS ''Beagle'']] expedition encounter a rogue Silurian group in the [[Galápagos Islands]]. The audio drama reveals that the leader of this group had been responsible for creating humanity's prehistoric ancestors via a forbidden breeding program, sabotaging the Silurian stasis chambers to escape punishment for his actions. In the audio drama ''[[The Poison Seas]]'' (2003), from the ''[[Bernice Summerfield]]'' series of adventures, Summerfield travels to the planet Chosan sometime in the future to assist a colony of Earth Reptiles (Sea Devils) under threat there. In ''[[UNIT: The Coup]]'' (2004), the Silurians attempt to finally make peace with the humans, though the general public believes it to be a stunt involving men in rubber suits. In ''[[UNIT: The Wasting]]'' (2005), Silurians aid UNIT in finding a cure for a deadly plague. In 2017, the Silurians appear in the Seventh Doctor audio ''[[The Silurian Candidate]]'', where the Silurian Triad of 2088 attempt to infiltrate a crucial peace conference by brainwashing one of the participants so that he will kill himself and the other major leader in a manner that would trigger a nuclear war, but the Doctor is able to avert this plan, and instead proposes a new plan where the Silurian colonies will come out of suspended animation millennia in the future after Earth recovers from being ravaged by solar flares (as referenced in ''[[The Ark in Space]]''), colonies gradually 'waking up' so that humanity and Silurians will essentially rebuild Earth without either side possessing numerical superiority.

===Outside ''Doctor Who''===
Silurians also appear outside ''Doctor Who''-related media. A cave drawing of a Silurian and a Sea Devil appear in a cave on [[Mars]] in a work of [[steampunk]] fiction by [[D'Israeli (cartoonist)|D'Israeli]], ''[[Scarlet Traces|Scarlet Traces: The Great Game]]''. Silurians and Sea Devils are referenced in the second volume of [[Alan Moore]]'s ''[[League of Extraordinary Gentlemen]]'' where they were connected to [[Gill-man|the creature]] [[The Creature from the Black Lagoon|from the Black Lagoon]]; ''League of Extraordinary Gentlemen'' is set in a fictional universe which reconciles the exploits of all fictional characters in one continuity.

A 2018 journal article set to be published in the ''International Journal of Astrobiology'', in which the authors discuss the detectability of past industrial civilizations in Earth's geologic record,  makes reference to the "Silurian Hypothesis" in its title.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite arxiv|last=Schmidt|first=Gavin A.|last2=Frank|first2=Adam|date=2018-04-10|title=The Silurian Hypothesis: Would it be possible to detect an industrial civilization in the geological record?|eprint=1804.03748|class=astro-ph.EP}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The Sea Devils also feature in an animated version of ‘Dr Poo’, a character from scattological adult comic Viz based on Tom Baker’s portrayal of Doctor Who.

The '''skvader''' ({{IPA-sv|ˈskvɑːdɛr|pron}}) is a [[Sweden|Swedish]] fictional creature that was constructed in 1918 by the [[taxidermist]] Rudolf Granberg and is permanently displayed at the museum at Norra Berget in [[Sundsvall]]. It has the forequarters and hindlegs of a [[European hare]] (''Lepus europaeus''), and the back, wings and tail of a female [[Western capercaillie|wood grouse]] (''Tetrao urogallus''). It was later jokingly given the Latin name ''Tetrao lepus pseudo-hybridus rarissimus'' L.

==Name==
The name is a combination of two words, and this is the explanation provided by the ''[[Svenska Akademiens ordbok]]'' (Dictionary of the Swedish Academy): "The prefix ''skva-'' from 'skvattra' (quack or chirp), and the suffix ''-der'' from 'tjäder' ([[Western capercaillie|wood grouse]])".

==Origins==
The skvader originates from a [[tall tale]] hunting story told by a man named Håkan Dahlmark during a dinner at a restaurant in Sundsvall in the beginning of the 20th century. To the amusement of the other guests, Dahlmark claimed that he in 1874 had shot such an animal during a hunt north of Sundsvall. On his birthday in 1907, his [[Housekeeper (domestic worker)|housekeeper]] jokingly presented him with a painting of the animal, made by her nephew and shortly before his death in 1912, Dahlmark donated the painting to a local museum. During an exhibition in [[Örnsköldsvik]] in 1916 the manager of the museum became acquainted with the [[taxidermist]] Rudolf Granberg. He then mentioned the hunting story and the painting and asked Granberg if he could re-construct the animal. In 1918 Granberg had completed the skvader and it has since then been a very popular exhibition item at the museum, which also has the painting on display.

==Similar creatures==
[[File:Wolpertinger.jpg|thumb|Wolpertinger edited from a drawing of a [[hare]] by [[Albrecht Dürer]].]]
A strikingly similar creature called the "rabbit-bird" was described by [[Pliny the Elder]] in ''[[Natural History (Pliny)|Natural History]]''.  This creature had the body of a bird with a rabbit's head and was said to have inhabited the [[Alps]].&lt;ref name = "pliny"&gt;[[Pliny the Elder]] (77–79 CE). ''[[Natural History (Pliny)|Natural History]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other similar creatures include the [[Bavaria|Bavarian]] ''[[wolpertinger]]'', the [[Austria|Austrian]] ''raurakl'', the [[Thuringian Forest]]'s ''[[rasselbock]]'', the [[Palatinate (region)|Palatinate]]'s ''[[Elwedritsche]]'', and the [[United States of America|American]] ''[[jackalope]]''.

==Symbolism==
[[Image:Skvader sign.jpg|thumb|left|A road sign on the approach to the museum warns drivers for skvaders on the road.]]
The skvader has since then often been seen as an unofficial symbol for Sundsvall and when the province [[Medelpad]] was to be given a provincial animal (in addition to the provincial flower) in 1987, many locals voted for the skvader. The final choice was a kind of compromise, the [[mountain hare]], which is the front-end of the skvader.

==Other uses==
[[Image:Mercedes-Benz LPO 322.jpg|thumb|A typical "skvader" bus]]
The term "skvader" is nowadays used colloquially in [[Swedish language|Swedish]] to mean "a bad compromise" or "a combination of contradicting elements".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sok.saol.se/pages/P846_M.jpg |title="Skvader" in '&amp;#39;Svenska Akademiens ordlista över svenska språket'&amp;#39; |date= |accessdate=2014-05-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Skvader" also became the nickname in the 1950s and 1960s for a combination [[bus]] and lorry ([[truck]]), or [[Bruck (vehicle)|bruck]], which was commonly used on small bus routes in [[Norrland]]; the front-end was a bus taking passengers and the back-end was an open loading bay, often used for delivering milk from small farmers to the nearest [[dairy]].

"Skvaderns" is also a herbal liquer made with herbs from the forest Lunde Skog, the place Skvaderns first were shot at.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.systembolaget.se/87941|title=Produktsida|publisher=|accessdate=1 April 2016}}{{dead link|date=May 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The mission was launched on a [[Saturn IB]] rocket on May 25, 1973, and carried a three-person crew to the station. The name Skylab 2 also refers to the vehicle used for that mission. The Skylab 2 mission established a twenty-eight-day record for human spaceflight duration. Furthermore, its crew were the first space station occupants ever to return safely to Earth –  the only previous space station occupants, the crew of the 1971 [[Soyuz 11]] mission that had manned the [[Salyut 1]] station for twenty-four days, died upon reentry due to unexpected cabin [[depressurization]].

The manned Skylab missions were officially designated ''Skylab 2'', ''3'', and ''4''. Miscommunication about the numbering resulted in the mission emblems reading ''Skylab I'', ''Skylab II'', and ''Skylab 3'' respectively.&lt;ref name="Skylab Numbering Fiasco"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.collectspace.com/resources/naming_spacecraft.html|title=Naming Spacecraft: Confusion Reigns|last=Pogue|first=William|publisher=collectSPACE|accessdate=April 24, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Skylab]] station suffered significant damage on its May 14 launch: its micrometeorite shield, and one of its primary [[Photovoltaic module|solar array]]s had torn loose during launch, and the remaining primary solar array was jammed. Without the shield which was designed to also provide thermal protection, Skylab baked in the Sun, and rising temperatures inside the workshop released toxic materials into the station's atmosphere and endangered on-board film and food. The first crew was supposed to launch on May 15, but instead had to train practicing repair techniques as they were developed by the engineers.&lt;ref name="livingandworking"&gt;Benson, Charles Dunlap and William David Compton. ''[https://history.nasa.gov/SP-4208/contents.htm Living and Working in Space: A History of Skylab]''. NASA publication SP-4208.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|253–255,259}} Ground controllers purged the atmosphere with pure nitrogen four times, before refilling it with the nitrogen/oxygen atmosphere for the crew.&lt;ref&gt;''Skylab: A Chronology'', May 14&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 25, Skylab 2 lifted from LC-39B, the first Saturn IB launch in almost five years and only the second-ever launch from Pad 39B. Booster performance was nominal except for one momentary glitch that could have threatened the mission - when the Commit signal was sent to the Saturn at ignition, the instrument unit sent a command to switch the launch vehicle from internal to external power. This would have shut down the Saturn's electrical system, but not the propulsion system and likely cause the disaster scenario of an uncontrollable booster, requiring the Launch Escape System to be activated and the Command Module pulled away to safety, followed by Range Safety destroying the errant launch vehicle. However, the duration of the cutoff signal was less than one second, too short a time for the electrical relay in the booster to be activated, thus nothing happened and the launch proceeded as planned. This glitch was traced to a modification of the pad electrical equipment and corrective steps were subsequently taken to prevent it from happening again.&lt;ref name="livingandworking"/&gt;{{rp|269}}&lt;ref&gt;https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/19730025087.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; On reaching the station, Conrad flew their [[Apollo Command/Service Module]] (CSM) around it to inspect the damage, then soft-docked with it to avoid the necessity of [[orbital station-keeping|station keeping]] while the crew ate, and flight controllers planned the first repair attempt. Then they undocked so that Conrad could position the Apollo by the jammed solar panel, so that Weitz could perform a stand-up [[Extra-vehicular activity|EVA]], trying to free the array by tugging at it with a 10-foot hooked pole, while Kerwin held onto his legs. This failed, and consumed a significant amount of the Skylab's nitrogen maneuvering fuel to keep it steady in the process.

The crew then attempted to perform the hard dock to Skylab, but the capture latches failed to operate. After eight failed attempts, they donned their pressure suits again and partially dis-assembled the CSM's docking probe; the next attempt worked. Once inside the station, the crew deployed a collapsible parasol through the small scientific airlock to act as a sunshade. (This approach was suggested and designed by NASA's "Mr. Fix It" [[Jack Kinzler]], who was awarded the [[NASA Distinguished Service Medal]] for the effort.)  Successful deployment of the sunshade dropped inside temperatures to sustainable levels.&lt;ref name="SP400ch4"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://history.nasa.gov/SP-400/ch4.htm |title=SP-400 Skylab, Our First Space Station |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |year=1977 |website= |publisher=[[NASA]] |accessdate=May 8, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Skylab 2 Deorbiting.jpg|thumb|View of Skylab from the Skylab 2 Command/Service Module during the final flyaround inspection.]]
Two weeks later, Conrad and Kerwin performed a second EVA, finally freeing the stuck solar panel and increasing the electrical power to the workshop. They had prepared for this repair by [[Neutral buoyancy simulation as a training aid|practicing]] in the [[Neutral Buoyancy Simulator]] at the [[Marshall Space Flight Center]]. Without power from the panel, the second and third Skylab missions would have been unable to perform their main experiments, and the station's critical battery system would have been seriously degraded.&lt;ref name="livingandworking"/&gt;{{rp|271–276}}  During this EVA, the sudden deployment of the solar panel structure caused both astronauts to be flung from the Skylab hull, testing their nerves as well as the strength of their safety tethers.  After recovering their composure, both astronauts returned to their positions on Skylab and completed the EVA.&lt;ref&gt;David J. Shayler, [[British Interplanetary Society|FBIS]], ''Walking in Space'', 2004, p. 213, Praxis Publishing Ltd.&lt;/ref&gt;

For nearly a month they made further repairs to the workshop, conducted medical experiments, gathered solar and Earth science data, and performed a total of 392 hours of experiments. The mission tracked two minutes of a large [[solar flare]] with the [[Apollo Telescope Mount]]; they took and returned some 29,000 frames of film of the sun.&lt;ref name="livingandworking"/&gt;{{rp|291}} The Skylab 2 astronauts spent 28 days in space, which doubled the previous U.S. record. The mission ended successfully on June 22, 1973, when Skylab 2 splashed down in the Pacific Ocean 9.6&amp;nbsp;km from the recovery ship [[USS Ticonderoga (CV-14)|USS ''Ticonderoga'']]. Skylab 2 set the records for the longest duration manned spaceflight, greatest distance traveled and greatest mass docked in space. Conrad set the record for most time in space for an astronaut.

==Mission insignia==
The Skylab 1 patch was designed by [[Frank Kelly Freas|Kelly Freas]], a well-known artist highly regarded in the science fiction community, who was suggested to NASA by science fiction author and editor [[Ben Bova]]. The insignia features Skylab above the earth with the sun in the background. In an article for Analog Science Fiction/Science Fact magazine, Freas said, "Among the suggestions the astronauts had made was the idea of a solar eclipse as seen from Skylab. It soon became clear that this idea would solve several problems at once: it pointed up the solar study function of Skylab, it would give me the large circular shape of the Earth as counterpoint to the angularity of the cluster, and it would establish firmly the connection of Skylab to the Earth. In addition, it would give a chance to get the necessary high contrast for good visibility of the tiny finished patch. ... I made several studies of cloud patterns on the planet, reducing them finally to very conventionalized swirls. The Skylab cluster was simplified and simplified again, till it became simply a black form with a white edgelight to set it off."

The organization and definition of groups within a social system depend on various shared characteristics such as location, socioeconomic status, race, religion, societal function, or other distinguishable features.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/social-system.html|title=What is social system? definition and meaning|website=BusinessDictionary.com|language=en|access-date=2017-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Notable theorists ==
The study of social systems is integral to the fields of sociology and public policy. Social systems have been studied for as long as sociology has existed.

=== Talcott Parsons ===
[[Talcott Parsons]] was the first to formulate a systematic theory of social systems, which he did as a part of his [[AGIL paradigm]]. He defined a social system as only a segment (or a "subsystem") of what he called [[Action theory (sociology)|action theory]].&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Social System|last=Parsons|first=Talcott|publisher=Routledge|year=1951|isbn=0-203-99295-4|location=England|pages=15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Parsons organized social systems in terms of action units, where one action executed by an individual is one unit. He defines a social system as a network of interactions between actors.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; According to Parsons, social systems rely on a system of language, and [[culture]] must exist in a society in order for it to qualify as a social system.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Parsons' work laid the foundations for the rest of the study of social systems theory and ignited the debate over what framework social systems should be built around, such as actions, communication, or other relationships.

=== Niklas Luhmann ===
[[Niklas Luhmann]] was a prominent sociologist and social systems theorist who laid the foundations of modern social system thought.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cambriapress.com/cambriapress.cfm?template=4&amp;bid=339|title=Observing Society: Meaning, Communication, and Social Systems  By Daniel B. Lee and Achim Brosziewski|website=www.cambriapress.com|language=en|access-date=2017-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; He based his definition of a "social system" on the mass network of communication between people and defined society itself as an "autopoietic" system, meaning a self-referential and self-reliant system that is distinct from its environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SMlvNXfpxfoC&amp;pg=PA117&amp;lpg=PA117&amp;dq=social+systems&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=9Tk1wDUDhX&amp;sig=JWsWpj5thEmyB7Afc3fu-JBTbK4&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjKj8uipq3UAhVi2IMKHZGlDtg4HhDoAQhXMAg#v=onepage&amp;q=social%20systems&amp;f=false|title=Luhmann's "social Systems" Theory: Preliminary Fragments for a Theory of Translation|last=Vermeer|first=Hans J.|date=2006|publisher=Frank &amp; Timme GmbH|isbn=9783865961020|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Luhmann considered social systems as belonging to three categories: societal systems, organizations, and interaction systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mayrhofer|first=Wolfgang|date=2004|title=Social Systems Theory as Theoretical Framework for Human Resource Management – Benediction or Curse?|jstor=41783463|journal=Management Revue|volume=15|issue=2|pages=178–191}}&lt;/ref&gt; Luhmann considered societal systems, such as religion, law, art, education, science, etc., to be closed systems consisting of different fields of interaction.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Niklas Luhmann and Organizational Studies|last=David Seidl|first=Kai Helge Becker|publisher=CBS press|year=2013|isbn=978-87-630-0304-9|location=Denmark|pages=35–42}}&lt;/ref&gt; Organizations were defined as a network of decisions which reproduce themselves; his definition is difficult to apply in terms of finding a real-world example.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Finally, interaction systems are systems that reproduce themselves on the basis of communication rather than decision making.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Jay Wright Forrester ===
[[Jay Wright Forrester]] founded the field of [[system dynamics]], which deals with the simulation of interactions in dynamic systems. In his work on social systems, he discusses the possibilities of social system dynamics, or modeling social systems using computers with the aim of testing the possible effects of passing new public policies or laws. In his paper he recognized the difficulty of producing a reliable computer model system, but argued that an imperfect model was better than none and simply implementing new policy.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.constitution.org/ps/cbss.htm|title=Jay W. Forrester: Counterintuitive Behavior of Social Systems|access-date=2017-06-09|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Forrester argued that unsuccessful public policies aim to treat the symptoms rather than the causes of social issues and that they also generally focus on  rather than  efforts. This occurs because there is either an incomplete understanding or a misunderstanding of the causes of an issue on the part of the policymakers, which often leads to ineffective or detrimental policies which aggravate the issues they were implemented to correct or cause other issues to arise. Another problem Forrester notes is that some policies which may work in the long run may aggravate an issue in the short run. A successful policy according to Forrester must target the correct leverage points, in this case the aspect of the social problem which, if modified, will produce a sizeable enough effect to correct the problem.

== Modeling ==
One significant problem with studying social systems is the difficulty of forming and testing theories; social systems are not easily manipulated or controlled and large-scale systems cannot be reproduced in a lab setting.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=JACKSON|first=MICHAEL C.|date=1985-01-01|title=Social Systems Theory and Practice: The Need for a Critical Approach|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/03081078508934877|journal=International Journal of General Systems|volume=10|issue=2-3|pages=135–151|doi=10.1080/03081078508934877|issn=0308-1079}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the rapid increase in the availability of digital [[data]] over the last decade gives scientists studying the behaviors of social systems very detailed and much more holistic pictures of how social systems respond to various events and how networked social systems behave.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Vespignani|first=Alessandro|date=24 July 2009|title=Predicting the Behavior of Techno-Social Systems|url=http://www.gleamviz.org/wp-content/uploads/2009/04/science2009.pdf|journal=Science|volume=325|pages=425–428|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, the development and popularity of social media platforms such as [[Facebook]] and [[Twitter]] offer new ways to study the evolution of social systems and social networking behaviors with [[social graph]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://thesystemsthinker.com/extending-systems-thinking-to-social-systems/|title=Extending Systems Thinking to Social Systems - The Systems Thinker|date=2016-01-23|work=The Systems Thinker|access-date=2017-06-09|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even though the behaviors of these systems may be surprising or not yet well understood, the digital age offers a new frontier for the study of social systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.simonsfoundation.org/multimedia/simons-science-series/online-social-systems/|title=Online Social Systems {{!}} Simons Foundation|website=www.simonsfoundation.org|language=en-US|access-date=2017-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Notable past models are the WORLD2 and [[World3|WORLD3]] models: these both aimed to outline the world's distribution of resources. WORLD3 was based on the [[Club of Rome]]'s ''[[The Limits to Growth|Limits to Growth]].''

[[Image:Mech plonnik mlode sporofity.jpg|thumb|350px|Young sporophytes of the common [[moss]] ''[[Tortula muralis]]''. In mosses, the gametophyte is the dominant generation, while the sporophytes consist of sporangium-bearing stalks growing from the tips of the [[gametophyte]]s]] 

A '''sporophyte''' ({{IPAc-en|s|p|ɔː|r|əʊ|ˌ|f|aɪ|t}}) is the [[diploid]] [[multicellular]] stage in the [[Biological life cycle|life cycle]] of a [[plant]] or [[alga]]. It develops from the [[zygote]] produced when a [[haploid]] egg cell is fertilized by a haploid [[sperm]] and each sporophyte cell therefore has a double set of [[chromosome]]s, one set from each parent. All [[Embryophyta|land plants]], and most multicellular algae, have life cycles in which a multicellular diploid sporophyte phase alternates with a multicellular haploid [[gametophyte]] phase.  In the [[Spermatophyte|seed plants]], (''gymnosperms'') and [[flowering plant]]s (''angiosperms''), the sporophyte phase is more prominent than the gametophyte, and is the familiar green plant with its roots, stem, leaves and cones or flowers. In flowering plants the gametophytes are very reduced in size, and are represented by the germinated [[pollen]] and  the [[Ovule#Megagametophyte|embryo sac]].

The sporophyte produces [[spore]]s (hence the name) by [[meiosis]], a process also known as "reduction division" that reduces the number of chromosomes in each spore mother cell by half. The resulting meiospores develop into a gametophyte. Both the spores and the resulting gametophyte are haploid, meaning they only have one set of [[chromosome]]s. The mature gametophyte produces male or female [[gamete]]s (or both) by [[mitosis]]. [[Sexual reproduction of plants|The fusion of male and female gametes]] produces a diploid zygote which develops into a new sporophyte. This cycle is known as [[alternation of generations]] or alternation of phases.

[[Image:Acer palmatum BotGartenMuenster Faecherahorn 6691.jpg|350px|thumb|In [[flowering plant]]s, the sporophyte comprises the whole multicellular body except the [[pollen]] and [[Ovule#Megagametophyte|embryo sac]]]] 

[[Bryophytes]] ([[moss]]es, [[Marchantiophyta|liverwort]]s and [[hornworts]]) have a dominant gametophyte phase on which the adult sporophyte is dependent for nutrition. The [[embryo]] sporophyte develops by [[cell division]] of the zygote within the female sex organ or [[archegonium]], and in its early development is therefore nurtured by the gametophyte.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ralf Reski]](1998): Development, genetics and molecular biology of mosses. In: Botanica Acta. Bd. 111, S. 1-15.&lt;/ref&gt;
Because this embryo-nurturing feature of the life cycle is common to all land plants they are known collectively as the [[embryophytes]].
[[Image:Physcomitrella Sporophyt.JPG|thumb| Cleistocarpous sporophyte of the moss ''[[Physcomitrella patens]]'']]

Most algae have dominant gametophyte generations, but in some species the gametophytes and sporophytes are [[Morphology (biology)|morphologically]] similar ([[isomorphic]]). An independent sporophyte is the dominant form in all [[clubmoss]]es, [[horsetail]]s, [[fern]]s, gymnosperms, and angiosperms that have survived to the present day. Early land plants had sporophytes that produced identical spores ([[isosporous]] or [[homosporous]]) but the ancestors of the gymnosperms evolved complex [[heterosporous]] life cycles in which the spores producing male and female gametophytes were of different sizes, the female [[megaspore]]s tending to be larger, and fewer in number, than the male [[microspore]]s.

During the [[Devonian]] period several plant groups independently evolved [[heterospory]] and subsequently the habit of endospory, in which the gametophytes develop in miniaturized form inside the spore wall. By contrast in exosporous plants, including modern ferns, the gametophytes break the spore wall open on germination and develop outside it. The [[megagametophyte]]s of endosporic plants such as the [[Pteridospermatophyta|seed ferns]] developed within the sporangia of the parent sporophyte, producing a miniature multicellular female gametophyte complete with female sex organs,  or archegonia.  The [[oocytes]] were fertilized in the archegonia by free-swimming [[flagella]]te sperm produced by windborne miniaturized male gametophytes in the form of pre-pollen. The resulting zygote developed into the next sporophyte generation while still retained within the pre-[[ovule]], the single large female meiospore or megaspore contained in the modified [[sporangium]] or [[nucellus]] of the parent sporophyte. The evolution of heterospory and endospory were among the earliest steps in the evolution of [[seed]]s of the kind produced by gymnosperms and angiosperms today.

{{copy edit|for=improvement of English: clearly not written by a native speaker.|date=August 2018}}
In global optimization, a '''state transition algorithm (STA)''' is an [[iterative method]] that generates a sequence of improving approximate solutions for an [[optimization problem]]. Due to its intrinsic properties, an STA has the ability to find a global optimal solution in probability and can guarantee an optimal solution.

The state transition algorithm &lt;ref name=Zhou2012State/&gt;&lt;ref name=Zhou2014Nonlinear/&gt;&lt;ref name=Zhou2016Optimal/&gt;&lt;ref name=Zhou2016Discrete/&gt; was first proposed by Zhou et al. It is a stochastic global optimization method and aims to find a possible global or approximate optimal solution in a reasonable amount of time. In the context of the STA, a solution to an optimization problem is regarded as a state, and updating a solution can be regarded as a state transition. Using the state-space representation,&lt;ref name=Friedland2005Control/&gt; it describes solutions updating in a unified framework, and the execution operators to update solutions are expressed as state transition matrices, which make it easy to understand and flexible to implement:
: &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{x}_{k+1} = A_k \mathbf{x}_k + B_k \mathbf{u}_k&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{y}_{k+1} = f(\mathbf{x}_{k+1})&lt;/math&gt;
where:
: &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{x}_k &lt;/math&gt; stands for a current state, corresponding to a solution to an optimization problem;
: &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{u}_k &lt;/math&gt; is a function of &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{x}_{k} &lt;/math&gt; and historical states;
: &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{y}_k &lt;/math&gt; is the fitness value at &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{x}_{k} &lt;/math&gt;;  
: &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{A}_k, \mathbf{B}_k &lt;/math&gt; are state transformation matrices, which can be considered as execution operators; 
:  &lt;math&gt; f(\cdot) &lt;/math&gt; is the objective function or evaluation function. 
As a stochastic global optimization method, STA has the following properties:
* globality, STA has the ability to search the whole space;
* optimality, STA can guarantee to find an optimal solution; 
* convergence, the sequence generated by STA is convergent;
* rapidity, inherent advantages existing in STA to reduce the computational complexity;
* controllability, STA can control the search space flexibly.

== Continuous state transition algorithm (CSTA) ==
In continuous STA, &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{x}_k \in \mathbb{R}^n  &lt;/math&gt; is a continuous variable, and four special state transformation operators are designed to generate new candidate solutions.

=== State transformation operators ===
(1) Rotation transformation (RT)
: &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{x}_{k+1} = \mathbf{x}_k + \alpha \frac{1}{n\|\mathbf{x}_k\|_2} R_r \mathbf{x}_k &lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt; \alpha &lt;/math&gt; is a positive constant, called the rotation factor, &lt;math&gt; R_r \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times n} &lt;/math&gt; is a random matrix with its entries being uniformly distributed random variables defined on the interval [-1,1], and &lt;math&gt; \|\cdot\| &lt;/math&gt; is the 2-norm of a vector. 
The rotation transformation has the functionality to search in a hypersphere with maximal radius &lt;math&gt; \alpha &lt;/math&gt; , that is to say, &lt;math&gt; \|\mathbf{x}_{k+1} - \mathbf{x}_{k}\|_2 \leq \alpha &lt;/math&gt;.

(2) Translation transformation (TT)
: &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{x}_{k+1} = \mathbf{x}_k + \beta R_t \frac{\mathbf{x}_k - \mathbf{x}_{k-1}}{\|\mathbf{x}_k - \mathbf{x}_{k-1}\|_2} &lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt; \beta &lt;/math&gt; is a positive constant, called the translation factor, and &lt;math&gt; R_t \in  \mathbb{R} &lt;/math&gt;
is a uniformly distributed random variable defined on the interval [0,1]. The translation transformation has the functionality to search along a line from &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{x}_{k-1} &lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{x}_k &lt;/math&gt; at the starting point &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{x}_k &lt;/math&gt; with maximal length &lt;math&gt; \beta &lt;/math&gt;.

(3) Expansion transformation (ET)
: &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{x}_{k+1} = \mathbf{x}_k + \gamma R_e \mathbf{x}_k &lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt; \gamma &lt;/math&gt; is a positive constant, called the expansion factor, and &lt;math&gt; R_e \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times n} &lt;/math&gt; is a random diagonal matrix with its entries obeying the Gaussian distribution. The expansion transformation has the functionality to expand the entries in  &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{x}_k &lt;/math&gt; to the range of &lt;math&gt; [-\infty, +\infty] &lt;/math&gt;, searching in the whole space.

(4) Axesion transformation (AT)
: &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{x}_{k+1} = \mathbf{x}_k + \delta R_a \mathbf{x}_k &lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt; \delta &lt;/math&gt; is a positive constant, called the axesion factor, and &lt;math&gt; R_a \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times n} &lt;/math&gt; is a random diagonal matrix with its entries obeying the Gaussian distribution and with only one random position having nonzero value. The axesion transformation aims to search along the axes.

=== Regular neighbourhood and sampling ===
For a given solution &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{x}_k &lt;/math&gt;, a candidate solution &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{x}_{k+1} &lt;/math&gt; is generated by using one time of the aforementioned state transformation operators. Since the state transition matrix in each state transformation is random, the generated candidate solution is not unique. Based on a given point, it is not difficult to imagine that a '''regular neighbourhood''' will be automatically formed when using certain state transformation operators.

Since the entries in state transition matrix obey certain stochastic distribution, for any given solution, the new candidate becomes a random vector and its corresponding solution (the value of a random vector) can be regarded as a '''sample'''. Considering that any two random state transition matrices in each state transformation operator are independent,
several times of state transformation (called the degree of search enforcement, &lt;math&gt; SE &lt;/math&gt; for short) based on the given solution are performed for certain state transformation operator, yielding &lt;math&gt; SE &lt;/math&gt; samples.

=== An update strategy ===
As mentioned above, based on the incumbent best solution, a total number of ''SE'' candidate solutions are sampled. A new best solution is selected from the candidate set by virtue of the evaluation function, denoted as &lt;math&gt; newBest &lt;/math&gt;. 
Then, an update strategy based on '''greedy criterion''' is used to update the incumbent best solution:

: &lt;math&gt; \text{Best} = \text{newBest} &lt;/math&gt;, if &lt;math&gt; f(\text{newBest}) &lt; f(\text{Best}), &lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt; \text{Best} = \text{Best} &lt;/math&gt; , otherwise

=== Algorithm procedure of the basic continuous STA ===
With the state transformation operators, sampling technique and update strategy, the basic continuous STA can be described as follows:

Step 1: Initiate a random solution &lt;math&gt; Best &lt;/math&gt; and set &lt;math&gt; \alpha = \alpha_{\max} = 1, \alpha_{\min} = 10^{-4}, &lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt; \beta = 1, \gamma = 1, \delta = 1, fc = 2, k = 0; &lt;/math&gt;

Step 2: Generate &lt;math&gt; SE &lt;/math&gt; samples based on incumbent &lt;math&gt; Best &lt;/math&gt; using '''Expansion Transformation''', and then update the incumbent &lt;math&gt; Best &lt;/math&gt;  using greedy criterion incorporating &lt;math&gt; SE &lt;/math&gt; samples and incumbent &lt;math&gt; Best &lt;/math&gt; . Let us denote &lt;math&gt; newBest &lt;/math&gt; the best solution in &lt;math&gt; SE &lt;/math&gt; samples, if &lt;math&gt; f(newBest) &lt; f(Best) &lt;/math&gt;, then perform the '''Translation Transformation''' similarly to update the incumbent &lt;math&gt; Best &lt;/math&gt;;

Step 3: Generate &lt;math&gt; SE &lt;/math&gt; samples based on incumbent &lt;math&gt; Best &lt;/math&gt; using '''Rotation Transformation''', and then update the incumbent &lt;math&gt; Best &lt;/math&gt;  using greedy criterion incorporating &lt;math&gt; SE &lt;/math&gt; samples and incumbent &lt;math&gt; Best &lt;/math&gt; . If &lt;math&gt; f(newBest) &lt; f(Best) &lt;/math&gt;, then perform the '''Translation Transformation''' similarly to update the incumbent &lt;math&gt; Best &lt;/math&gt;;

Step 4: Generate &lt;math&gt; SE &lt;/math&gt; samples based on incumbent &lt;math&gt; Best &lt;/math&gt; using '''Axesion Transformation''', and then update the incumbent &lt;math&gt; Best &lt;/math&gt;  using greedy criterion incorporating &lt;math&gt; SE &lt;/math&gt; samples and incumbent &lt;math&gt; Best &lt;/math&gt; . If &lt;math&gt; f(newBest) &lt; f(Best) &lt;/math&gt;, then perform the '''Translation Transformation''' similarly to update the incumbent &lt;math&gt; Best &lt;/math&gt;;

Step 5: set &lt;math&gt; k = k + 1 &lt;/math&gt;, if &lt;math&gt; \alpha &lt; \alpha_{\min} &lt;/math&gt;, set  &lt;math&gt; \alpha = \alpha_{\max} &lt;/math&gt;, else set  &lt;math&gt; \alpha = \alpha /fc &lt;/math&gt;, and return to Step 2 until the maximum of iterations is met.

=== Philosophy behind the continuous STA ===
* The '''expansion transformation''' contributes to the globality since it has the functionality to search the whole space; 
*  The '''rotation transformation''' benefits the optimality since when &lt;math&gt; \alpha &lt;/math&gt; is sufficiently small, the incumbent best solution becomes a local optimal solution;
* The update strategy based on '''greedy criterion''' contributes to the convergence, that is to say, the sequence &lt;math&gt; \{f(\text{Best}_k)_{k=1}^\infty \}&lt;/math&gt; is convergent due to &lt;math&gt; f(\text{Best}_{k+1}) \leq f(\text{Best}_k) &lt;/math&gt; and the [[monotone convergence theorem]];
* The '''sampling technique''' (it can avoid complete enumeration) and the '''alternate use''' of state transformation operators help to reduce computational complexity;
* The parameters like &lt;math&gt; \alpha, \beta, \gamma, \delta &lt;/math&gt; can be adjusted to control the search space.

==Applications of STA==

STA has found a variety of applications, like image segmentation,&lt;ref name=Han2015multi/&gt; 
task assignment,&lt;ref name=Dong2015discrete/&gt; energy consumption in the alumina evaporation process,&lt;ref name=Wang2016Optimization/&gt; resolution of overlapping linear

The '''''Testament and Death of Moses''''' is a fresco attributed to the Italian Renaissance painters [[Luca Signorelli]] and [[Bartolomeo della Gatta]],  executed in around 1482 and located in the [[Sistine Chapel]], [[Rome]].

==History==
On 27 October 1480 a group of Florentine painters left for Rome, where he had been called as part of the reconciliation project between [[Lorenzo de' Medici]], the ''de facto'' ruler of [[Republic of Florence|Florence]], and [[Pope Sixtus IV]]. The Florentines started to work in the [[Sistine Chapel]] as early as the Spring of 1481, along with [[Pietro Perugino]], who was already there. Neither Bartolomeo della Gatta nor Luca Signorelli (who was thirty at the time) appear in the official contracts signed between the Papal court and the painters, but they were most likely among the assistants of Perugino, who was the general superintendent of the works. Signorelli is mentioned in the Sistine Chapel after his master left in 1482, as the author of the ''Disputation over Moses' Body'' on the entrance wall (repainted by [[Matteo da Lecce]] in 1574 due to its poor state).
[[File:Signorelli, testamento e morte di mosè 03.jpg|left|thumb|220px|Detail of the fresco.]]
It has been supposed that Perugino provided at least the layout of the fresco, while its realization, basing on a comment by [[Giorgio Vasari]], had been assigned traditionally to Signorelli. Studies by art historians such as [[Mario Salmi]], reduced Signorelli's presence in the work, and attributed most of the painting to Bartolomeo della Gatta, a painter influenced by the purity of [[Piero della Francesca]] and the early Perugino.

The theme of the decoration was a parallel between the Stories of Moses and those of Christ, as a sign of continuity between the [[Old Testament|Old]] and the [[New Testament]]. A continuity also between the divine law of the Tables and the message of Jesus, who, in turn, chose Peter (the first alleged bishop of Rome) as his successor: this would finally result in  a legitimation of the latter's successors, the popes of Rome.

==Description==
The fresco portrays the last episode in Moses' life, in two sectors: a foreground one including two scenes, and a background one, with three further scenes and, on the right, a landscape. Moses is always recognizable through his yellow garments and the green cloak, as in the rest of the cycle. The artist made an extensive use of gold painting.

On the background Moses, on the [[Mount Nebo (Jordan)|Mount Nebo]], receives by an angel the command baton, which gives him the authority to lead the Israelites towards the [[Promised Land]]. Below, Moses descends from the mountain with the baton in his hand, similarly to [[Cosimo Rosselli]]'s ''[[Descent from Mount Sinai (Sistine Chapel)|Descent from Mount Sinai]]'' nearby. In the foreground, on the right, is a 120-year-old Moses  speaking at the crowd while holding the baton and a Holy Book: rays of light stem from his head. At his feet is the [[Ark of the Covenant]], opened to show the [[Twelve Tables]] and the vase of the [[Manna]]. In the center, the procession includes a woman holding a child on her shoulders, wearing silk,  an elegant youth portrayed from behind and a naked man sitting. The latter two characters are attributed to Luca Signorelli, as well as the man with a stick next the throne of Moses.

On the left is the appointment of [[Joshua]] as Moses' successor; the former kneels to receive the command baton, while the prophet has  his cloak opened, showing a red-lined interior. Finally, on the left background, is the corpse of Moses on a shroud, surrounded by the dismayed Israelites.

'''Thangthong Klongjan''' ({{lang-th|แท่งทอง คลองจันทร์}}; formerly: '''Tongdaeng Klongjan''' (ทองแดง คลองจันทร์); August 13, 1978 – May 26, 2012), who boxes as ''' Thangthong Kiettaweesuk''' (แท่งทอง เกียรติทวีสุข)  is a former [[Thailand|Thai]] [[professional boxer]] and [[amateur boxer]] who fought in [[Bantamweight]] and [[Super bantamweight]] division.

==Boxing career==
Thangthong (nicknamed: Daeng; แดง&lt;ref name=แดง/&gt;) was born on August 13, 1978 at a remote village in [[Tambon]] Nong Bon, [[Amphoe Bo Rai]], [[Trat province]]. he started his boxing career as a [[Muay Thai]] kickboxer which he got a moderate success, occupying the Muay Thai 105lb title of famous [[Lumpinee Boxing Stadium]] during 1999–2001.  Then, he turned to amateur boxing, being a member of the Thailand national team and winning a bronze medal Bantamweight in the [[2005 Southeast Asian Games|2005 SEA Games]] at [[Manila]], [[Philippines]].

Later in 2007 he turned to professional boxing and won the [[International Boxing Federation|IBF]] Pan Pacific Bantamweight title in his seventh fight by defeating North Korean boxer, I-hon Kim on November 23, 2007 at Bangkok Bus Terminal (Morchit), [[Chatuchak District]], [[Bangkok]] and defended all 10 times.

In 2010 he won the vacant [[World Boxing Council|WBC]] International Bantamweight by points over Kenyan boxer, Nick Otieno at [[Ratchaburi province]] and he defended his IBF title 15 time by defeating the points over Richard Samosir an Indonesian challenger on May 20, 2011 at [[Rayong province]].

On May 18, 2012 he won the IBF [[Junior featherweight]] [[interim title]]&lt;ref name=ทอง/&gt;&lt;ref name=แดง&gt;{{cite web|url=http://test.thairath.co.th/content/261606|title=แท่งทองชนะน็อก คว่ำซินยาบียก10 ได้ขึ้นชิงแชมป์โลก |date=2012-05-19|accessdate=2017-09-17|language=Thai|work=[[Thairath]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; over Macbute Sinyabi South Africans by [[Knockout|KO]] in the 10th round at [[Nakhon Ratchasima province]] in the elimination fight for winner to challenge with the winner of the IBF-[[World Boxing Organization|WBO]] unification fight between [[Nonito Donaire]] and [[Jeffrey Mathebula]] in order of IBF.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ช็อกวงการ ยอดมวย 'แท่งทอง' รถแหกโค้งเสียชีวิต |url=https://www.thairath.co.th/content/263610|date=2012-05-27|accessdate=2017-09-17|language=Thai|work=Thairath}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Car accident==
But after only eight days on May 26, 2012 he was tragically killed in a car accident with his family, including Theeraporn Klongjan his wife and twin nephews at [[Sukhumvit Road]], [[Chanthaburi province]] which also ended his record to 24-0 (17KOs).&lt;ref name=ทอง&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.voicetv.co.th/thailand/40105.html|title=นักชก 'แท่งทอง' แหกโค้งเสียชีวิตที่เมืองจันท์|work=[[Voice TV]]|language=Thai|accessdate=2017-09-17|date=2012-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=box&gt;{{boxrec|id=386562}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Seventh Seal''''' ({{lang-sv|'''Det sjunde inseglet'''}}) is a 1957 Swedish [[historical fantasy]] film written and directed by [[Ingmar Bergman]]. Set in Denmark&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Raw |first=Laurence |url=https://books.google.com/?id=NG64WN7WruAC |title=The Ridley Scott Encyclopedia |publisher=The Rowman &amp; Littlefield Publishing Group, Inc. |year=2009 |page=284|isbn=9780810869523 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Litch |first=Mary M. |url=https://books.google.com/?id=bItUHBmB8YIC |title=Philosophy Through Film  |publisher=Routledge | year=2010|page=193|isbn=9780203863329 }}&lt;/ref&gt; during the [[Black Death]], it tells of the journey of a medieval [[knight]] ([[Max von Sydow]]) and a game of [[chess]] he plays with the [[Death (personification)|personification of Death]] ([[Bengt Ekerot]]), who has come to take his life. Bergman developed the film from his own play ''Wood Painting''. The title refers to a passage from the [[Book of Revelation]], used both at the very start of the film, and again towards the end, beginning with the words "And when [[Lamb of God|the Lamb]] had opened the [[seven seals|seventh seal]], there was silence in heaven about the space of half an hour".{{bibleref2c|Rev.|8:1|KJV}} Here the motif of silence refers to the "silence of God," which is a major theme of the film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Bragg |first=Melvyn |authorlink=Melvyn Bragg |url=https://books.google.com/?id=oahZAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=Melvyn+Bragg+(Det+Sjunde+Inseglet)&amp;dq=Melvyn+Bragg+(Det+Sjunde+Inseglet) |title= The Seventh Seal (Det Sjunde Inseglet) |publisher=BFI Publishing |year= 1998 |page=45|isbn=9780851703916 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.criterion.com/current/posts/1171-the-seventh-seal-there-go-the-clowns |title=''The Seventh Seal'': There Go the Clowns |last=Giddins |first=Gary |publisher=The Criterion Collection |date=June 15, 2009 |accessdate=April 7, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Seventh Seal'' is considered a classic of [[world cinema]], as well as one of the [[List of films considered the best|greatest movies of all time]]. It established Bergman as a world-renowned director, containing scenes which have become iconic through homages, critical analysis, and parodies.

==Plot==
Disillusioned knight Antonius Block ([[Max von Sydow]]) and his [[nihilism|nihilistic]] [[squire]] Jöns ([[Gunnar Björnstrand]]) return after fighting in the [[Crusades]] and find Denmark being ravaged by [[Black Death|the plague]]. On the beach immediately after their arrival, the knight encounters Death ([[Bengt Ekerot]]), personified as a pale, black-cowled figure resembling a monk. The knight, in the middle of a chess game he has been playing alone, challenges Death to a [[chess]] match, believing that he can forestall his demise as long as the game continues. Death agrees, and they start a new game.

The other characters in the story, except for Jof in the end, do not see Death, and when the chess board comes out at various times in the story, they believe the knight is continuing his habit of playing alone.

[[File:Ingmar Bergman-The Seventh Seal-01.jpg|thumb|left|Death and Antonius Block choose sides for the chess game; Death gets the black pieces.]]
The knight with his squire heads for his castle. Along the way, they pass some actors, Jof ([[Nils Poppe]]) and his wife Mia ([[Bibi Andersson]]), with their infant son Mikael and their actor-manager Jonas Skat ([[Erik Strandmark]]). Jof is also a juggler and has [[visions of Jesus and Mary]], although Mia is skeptical of them (especially since Jof is also given to lying).

Block and Jöns enter a church where a fresco of the ''[[Danse Macabre|Dance of Death]]'' is being painted. The squire draws a small figure representing himself, while chiding the artist for colluding in the religious and ideological fervour which has led to the disastrous crusade. Still hoping for resolution and comfort within his faith, the knight goes to the [[confessional]] where he is joined by Death in the robe of a priest. During confession, Block admits that his life has been futile and without meaning, but that he wants to perform "one meaningful deed".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title = The Seventh Seal | author=[[Ingmar Bergman]] | publisher=Touchstone | year= 1960 | pages = 147}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon revealing the [[chess strategy]] that will save his life, the knight discovers that the priest is Death, who promises to remember the [[chess tactics|tactics]]. Leaving the church, the knight speaks to a young woman ([[Maud Hansson]]) who has been condemned to be [[burned at the stake]] for consorting with [[the devil]]. He believes she will tell him about life beyond death, only to discover a woman beyond her sanity.

Shortly thereafter, Jöns searches an abandoned village for water. He saves a mute servant girl ([[Gunnel Lindblom]]) from being [[rape]]d by a man robbing a corpse. He recognizes the man as Raval ([[Bertil Anderberg]]), a theologian, who ten years prior had convinced the knight to leave his wife and join a crusade to the Holy Land. The squire promises to brand the theologian on the face if they meet again. The servant girl joins the squire. The trio ride into town, where the actors met earlier are performing. Skat the actor-manager introduces the other actors to the crowd, then is enticed by Lisa ([[Inga Gill]])—wife of the sentimental and violent blacksmith Plog—away for a tryst. They run off together. The actors' performance is interrupted by the arrival of a procession of [[flagellants]].

At the town's public house, Plog—jealous and wounded—is looking for Lisa. Both Jof and the manipulative Raval are also present: for the sake of mischief, Raval tells Plog that Jof knows what Lisa is doing. Raval manipulates Plog and the other customers into intimidating Jof, and forces Jof to dance on the tables like a bear. The bullying is broken up by the appearance of Jöns, who once again recognises Raval: true to his word, he slashes and permanently scars the theologian's face.&lt;ref&gt;Bergman, 1960 p. 164-165&lt;/ref&gt; Both knight and squire are reacquainted with Jof's family, with a repentant Plog also joining them. The knight enjoys a country picnic of milk and wild strawberries gathered by Mia. The knight says: "I'll carry this memory between my hands as if it were a bowl filled to the brim with fresh milk...And it will be an adequate sign—it will be enough for me."&lt;ref name="Bergman, 1960 p.172"&gt;Bergman, 1960 p.172.&lt;/ref&gt;

Moved by the simple love of Jof and Mia, Block relaxes his pursuit of religious meaning. He invites Plog and the actors to shelter in his [[castle]], where he believes they will be safer from the plague. Along the way, the party encounters Skat and Lisa in the forest. Dissatisfied with her new lover (and well aware that her husband will quickly forgive her), Lisa abandons Skat and returns to Plog, while Skat uses his acting skills—and possibly Jof's collusion—to fake a remorseful suicide. Once the group has moved on, Skat climbs a tree for the night. Appearing and informing the actor that his time is up, Death then cuts down the tree and kills him.

The travellers pass the condemned young woman again, now tied to a stake and awaiting burning. Block asks the woman again to summon [[Satan]], so he can ask him about God. The girl claims already to have done so, but the knight cannot see him, only her terror. As her execution fire is lit, the knight gives her herbs to take away her pain.&lt;ref&gt;Bergman, 1960 p.135&lt;/ref&gt; Jöns and Block watch, grimly, as her sentence is carried out.

Further along in the journey, Raval reappears: dying of the plague, he pleads for water. The servant girl attempts to bring him some, but Jöns stops her, and Raval dies alone and uncomforted. Jof tells his wife that he can see the knight playing chess with Death, and decides to flee with his family while Death is preoccupied.&lt;ref&gt;Bergman, 1960 p. 191.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Det-sjunde-inseglet-The-Seventh-Seal-Bergman-1957-dance-of-death.png|thumb|The final scene depicting the ''[[Danse Macabre]]''.]]
After hearing Death state "No one escapes me", Block knocks the chess pieces over, deliberately distracting Death while Jof's family slips away. Death places the pieces back on the board, then wins the game on the next move. He announces that when they meet again, the knight's time—and that of all those traveling with him—will be up. Before departing, Death asks if the knight has accomplished his one "meaningful deed" yet; Block replies that he has.

Block is reunited with his wife, Karin ([[Inga Landgré]]), the sole occupant of his castle (all the servants having fled). The party shares one "last supper" before Death comes for them. The knight prays to God, "Have mercy on us, because we are small and frightened and ignorant."&lt;ref name="berg-p195"&gt;Bergman, 1960 p. 195.&lt;/ref&gt; The mute servant girl speaks her only line: "It is finished."

Meanwhile, away from the castle, Jof's family sits out a storm which the juggler interprets to be "the ''Angel of Death''... and he's very big". The next morning, the juggler, with his [[second sight]], sees the knight and his followers being led away over the hills in a solemn ''Dance of Death''.

==Production==
[[File:Sjunde inseglet 1957.jpg|thumbnail|Filming of ''The Seventh Seal'' at [[Filmstaden]]]]
Bergman originally wrote the play ''Trämålning'' (''Wood Painting'') in 1953 / 1954 for the acting students of [[Malmö City Theatre]]. The first time it was performed in public was in radio in 1954, directed by Bergman. He also directed it on stage in [[Malmö]] the next spring, and in the autumn it was staged in [[Stockholm]], directed by [[Bengt Ekerot]] who would later play the character Death in the film version.&lt;ref name=svenskfilmografi&gt;[http://www.sfi.se/sv/svensk-film/Filmdatabasen/?itemid=4522&amp;type=MOVIE&amp;iv=Comments Det sjunde inseglet – Pressreaktion &amp; Kommentar Svensk Filmografi] (in Swedish). [[Swedish Film Institute]]. Retrieved on 17 August 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

In his autobiography, ''The Magic Lantern'', Bergman wrote that "''Wood Painting'' gradually became ''The Seventh Seal'', an uneven film which lies close to my heart, because it was made under difficult circumstances in a surge of vitality and delight."&lt;ref&gt;Ingmar Bergman (1988). ''The Magic Lantern''. Penguin Books. London. p. 274.&lt;/ref&gt; The script for the ''Seventh Seal'' was commenced while Bergman was in the [[Karolinska Hospital]] in [[Stockholm]] recovering from a stomach complaint.&lt;ref&gt;Bragg, 1998 p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt; It was at first rejected{{Who|date=January 2010}} and Bergman was given the go-ahead for the project from Carl-Anders Dymling at [[Svensk Filmindustri]] only after the success at Cannes of ''[[Smiles of a Summer Night]]''&lt;ref&gt;Bragg, 1998 p. 48.&lt;/ref&gt; Bergman rewrote the script five times and was given a schedule of only thirty-five days and a budget of $150,000.&lt;ref&gt;Bragg, 1998 p. 49.&lt;/ref&gt; It was to be the seventeenth film he had directed.&lt;ref&gt;Bragg, 1998 p. 46&lt;/ref&gt;

All scenes except two were shot in or around the [[Filmstaden]] studios in [[Solna Municipality|Solna]]. The exceptions were the famous opening scene with Death and the Knight playing chess by the sea and the ending with the [[Danse Macabre|dance of death]], which were both shot at [[Hovs Hallar]], a rocky, precipitous beach area in north-western [[Scania]].&lt;ref name=f2f&gt;[http://www.ingmarbergman.se/page.asp?guid=0A7C85BA-E1D8-410F-B9E0-95A5DC3CC844 Ingmar Bergman Face to Face – Shooting the film The Seventh Seal] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100823185840/http://www.ingmarbergman.se/page.asp?guid=0A7C85BA-E1D8-410F-B9E0-95A5DC3CC844 |date=23 August 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the ''Magic Lantern'' autobiography Bergman writes of the film's iconic penultimate shot: "The image of the Dance of Death beneath the dark cloud was achieved at hectic speed because most of the actors had finished for the day. Assistants, electricians, and a make-up man and about two summer visitors, who never knew what it was all about, had to dress up in the costumes of those condemned to death. A camera with no sound was set up and the picture shot before the cloud dissolved."&lt;ref&gt;Ingmar Bergman (1988). ''The Magic Lantern''. Penguin Books. London. pp. 274–275.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Portrait of the Middle Ages==
With regard to the relevancy of historical accuracy to a film that is heavily metaphorical and allegorical, John Aberth, writing in ''A Knight at the Movies'', holds
&lt;blockquote&gt;
the film only partially succeeds in conveying the period atmosphere and thought world of the fourteenth century. Bergman would probably counter that it was never his intention to make an historical or period film. As it was written in a program note that accompanied the movie's premier "It is a modern poem presented with medieval material that has been very freely handled...The script in particular—embodies a mid-twentieth century existentialist angst....Still, to be fair to Bergman, one must allow him his artistic license, and the script's modernisms may be justified as giving the movie's medieval theme a compelling and urgent contemporary relevance...Yet the film succeeds to a large degree because it is set in the Middle Ages, a time that can seem both very remote and very immediate to us living in the modern world....Ultimately ''The Seventh Seal'' should be judged as a historical film by how well it combines the medieval and the modern."&lt;ref&gt;John Aberth (2003). ''A Knight at the Movies''. Routledge. pp. 217–218.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Similarly defending it as an allegory, Aleksander Kwiatkowski in the book ''Swedish Film Classics'', writes
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The international response to the film which among other awards won the jury's special prize at Cannes in 1957 reconfirmed the author's high rank and proved that ''The Seventh Seal'' regardless of its degree of accuracy in reproducing medieval scenery may be considered as a universal, timeless allegory.&lt;ref&gt;''Swedish Film Classics by Aleksander Kwiatkowski'', Svenska filminstitutet p. 93&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Much of the film's imagery is derived from medieval art. For example, Bergman has stated that the image of a man playing chess with a skeletal Death was inspired by a medieval church painting from the 1480s in [[Täby kyrka]], [[Täby]], north of [[Stockholm]], painted by [[Albertus Pictor]].&lt;ref&gt;Stated in Marie Nyreröd's interview series (the first part named ''Bergman och filmen'') aired on [[Sveriges Television]] Easter 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Taby kyrka Death playing chess.jpg|thumb|upright|Death playing chess, from [[Täby Church]], fresco by [[Albertus Pictor]]]]

However, the medieval Sweden portrayed in this movie includes creative anachronisms. The [[flagellant]] movement was foreign to Sweden, and large-scale [[witch]] persecutions only began in the 15th century.&lt;ref&gt;Said by Swedish historian [[Dick Harrison]] in an introduction to the movie on [[Sveriges Television]], 2005. Reiterated in his book ''Gud vill det!'' {{ISBN|91-7037-119-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Generally speaking, historians [[Johan Huizinga]], [[Friedrich Heer]] and [[Barbara Tuchman]] have all argued that the late Middle Ages of the 14th century was a period of "doom and gloom" similar to what is reflected in this film, characterized by a feeling of pessimism, an increase in a penitential style of piety that was slightly masochistic, all aggravated by various disasters such as the Black Plague, famine, the [[Hundred Years' War]] between France and England, and [[papal schism]].&lt;ref name="Tuchman"&gt;Barbara Tuchman (1978). ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=5oUIhm81B-gC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false A Distant Mirror: The Calamitous 14th Century]''. New York: Alfred A. Knopf. {{ISBN|0-394-40026-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is sometimes called the [[crisis of the Late Middle Ages]] and Barbara Tuchman regards the 14th century as "[[A Distant Mirror|a distant mirror]]" of the 20th century in a way that echoes Bergman's sensibilities. Nonetheless, the main period of the [[Crusades]] is well before this era; they took place in a more optimistic period.&lt;ref name="Tuchman"/&gt;

==Major themes==
The title refers to a passage about the end of the world from the [[Book of Revelation]], used both at the very start of the film, and again towards the end, beginning with the words "And when the Lamb had opened the [[seven seals|seventh seal]], there was silence in heaven about the space of half an hour" ([[Book of Revelation|Revelation]] 8:1). Thus, in the confessional scene the knight states: "Is it so cruelly inconceivable to grasp God with the senses? Why should He hide himself in a mist of half-spoken promises and unseen miracles?...What is going to happen to those of us who want to believe but aren't able to?"&lt;ref&gt;Bergman, 1960 pp. 145–146.&lt;/ref&gt; Death, impersonating the confessional priest, refuses to reply. Similarly, later, as he eats the strawberries with the family of actors, Antonius Block says: "[[Faith]] is a torment – did you know that? It is like loving someone who is out there in the darkness but never appears, no matter how loudly you call."&lt;ref name="Bergman, 1960 p.172"/&gt; [[Melvyn Bragg|Bragg]] notes that the concept of the "Silence of God" in the face of evil, or the pleas of believers or would-be-believers, may be influenced by the punishments of silence meted out by Bergman's father, a chaplain in the State [[Lutheran]] Church.&lt;ref&gt;Bragg, 1998 pp. 40, 45.&lt;/ref&gt; In Bergman's original radio play sometimes translated as ''A Painting on Wood'', the figure of Death in a [[Dance of Death]] is represented not by an actor, but by [[silence]], "mere nothingness, mere absence...terrifying...the void."&lt;ref&gt;Martin Esslin. ''Mediations: Essays on Brecht, Beckett and the Media''. Abacus. London. 1980. p. 181.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the powerful influences on the film were [[Pablo Picasso|Picasso]]'s picture of the two acrobats, [[Carl Orff]]'s ''[[Carmina Burana (Orff)|Carmina Burana]]'', [[Strindberg]]'s dramas ''Folkungasagan'' ("The Saga of the Folkung Kings") and ''[[To Damascus|The Road to Damascus]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=5xYa6Q9VPfoC | author=Egil Törnqvist | title=Bergman's Muses: Æsthetic Versatility in Film, Theatre, Television and Radio  |publisher=McFarland &amp; Company, Inc. | year=2003|page=218| isbn=9780786482023 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the frescoes at Härkeberga church and a painting by [[Albertus Pictor]] in Täby church.&lt;ref name="Bragg, 1998 p. 49"&gt;Bragg, 1998 p. 49&lt;/ref&gt; Just prior to shooting Bergman directed for radio the play ''Everyman'' by [[Hugo von Hofmannsthal]].&lt;ref name="Bragg, 1998 p. 49"/&gt; By this time he had also directed plays by [[Shakespeare]], [[Strindberg]], [[Albert Camus|Camus]], [[G. K. Chesterton|Chesterton]], [[Anouilh]], [[Tennessee Williams]], [[Pirandello]], [[Lehár]], [[Molière]] and [[Alexander Ostrovsky|Ostrovsky]].&lt;ref&gt;Bragg, 1998 p. 29.&lt;/ref&gt; The actors [[Bibi Andersson]] (with whom Bergman was in a relationship 1955–59) who played the juggler's wife Mia, and [[Max von Sydow]], whose role as the knight was the first of many star parts he would bring to Bergman's films and whose rugged Nordic dignity became a vital resource within Bergman's "troupe" of key actors,&lt;ref&gt;Höök, Marianne, ''Ingmar Bergman'', Wahlström &amp; Widstrand, Stockholm, 1962 p.115f&lt;/ref&gt; both made a strong impact on the mood and style of the film.

Bergman grew up in a home infused with an intense Christianity, his father being a charismatic [[Rector (ecclesiastical)|rector]] (this may have explained Bergman's adolescent infatuation with [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]], which later deeply tormented him).&lt;ref&gt;Bragg, 1998 p. 44.&lt;/ref&gt; As a six-year-old child, Bergman used to help the gardener carry corpses from the Royal Hospital Sophiahemmet (where his father was chaplain) to the mortuary.&lt;ref name="Bragg, 1998 p. 43"&gt;Bragg, 1998 p. 43&lt;/ref&gt; When, as a boy, he saw the film ''[[Black Beauty (1921 film)|Black Beauty]]'', the fire scene excited him so much he stayed in bed for three days with a temperature.&lt;ref name="Bragg, 1998 p. 43"/&gt; Despite living a [[Bohemianism|Bohemian]] lifestyle in partial rebellion against his upbringing, Bergman often signed his scripts with the initials "S.D.G" (''Soli Deo Gloria'') — "To God Alone the Glory" — just as [[Johann Sebastian Bach|J.&amp;nbsp;S.&amp;nbsp;Bach]] did at the end of every musical composition.&lt;ref&gt;Bragg, 1998 p. 28.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Gerald Mast]] writes,
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Like [[The Gravediggers|the gravedigger]] in ''[[Hamlet]]'', the Squire [...] treats death as a bitter and hopeless joke. Since we all play chess with death, and since we all must suffer through that hopeless joke, the only question about the game is how long it will last and how well we will play it. To play it well, to live, is to love and not to hate the body and the mortal as the [[Roman Catholic Church|Church]] urges in Bergman's metaphor."&lt;ref&gt;Gerald Mast ''A Short History of the Movies.'' p. 405.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Melvyn Bragg]] writes,
&lt;blockquote&gt;"[I]t is constructed like an argument. It is a story told as a sermon might be delivered: an allegory...each scene is at once so simple and so charged and layered that it catches us again and again...Somehow all of Bergman's own past, that of his father, that of his reading and doing and seeing, that of his Swedish culture, of his political burning and religious melancholy, poured into a series of pictures which carry that swell of contributions and contradictions so effortlessly that you could tell the story to a child, publish it as a storybook of photographs and yet know that the deepest questions of religion and the most mysterious revelation of simply being alive are both addressed."&lt;ref&gt;Bragg, 1998 pp. 64–65&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Jesuit publication ''America'' identifies it as having begun "a series of seven films that explored the possibility of faith in a post-Holocaust, nuclear age".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.americamagazine.org/content/article.cfm?article_id=10155 |title=Ingmar Bergman, Theologian? |author=Richard A. Blake |date=August 27, 2007 |website=|publisher=America magazine |accessdate=14 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, film historians Thomas W. Bohn and Richard L. Stromgren identify this film as beginning "his cycle of films dealing with the conundrum of religious faith".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Light and shadows: a history of motion pictures |last=Bohn |first=Thomas |authorlink= |author2=Richard L.

==Reception==
Upon its original Swedish release, ''The Seventh Seal'' was met with a somewhat divided critical response; its cinematography was widely praised, while "Bergman the scriptwriter [was] lambasted."&lt;ref name="BergmanReferenceGuide"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eJCGNAlqB0gC&amp;pg=PA224|title=Ingmar Bergman: A Reference Guide|page=224|last=Steene|first=Birgitta|publisher=Amsterdam University Press|date=2005|isbn=978-9053564066}}&lt;/ref&gt; Swedish journalist and critic Nils Beyer, writing for ''[[Social-Demokraten|Morgon-tidningen]]'', compared it to [[Carl Theodor Dreyer]]'s ''[[The Passion of Joan of Arc]]'' and ''[[Day of Wrath]]''. While finding Dreyer's films to be superior, he still noted that "it isn't just any director that you feel like comparing to the old Danish master." He also praised the usage of the cast, in particular Max von Sydow whose character he described as "a pale, serious [[Don Quixote]] character with a face as if sculpted in wood", and "Bibi Andersson, who appears as if painted in faded watercolours but still can emit small delicious glimpses of female warmth." Hanserik Hjertén for ''[[Arbetaren]]'' started his review by praising the cinematography but soon went on to describe the film as "a horror film for children" and said that beyond the superficial, it is mostly reminiscent of Bergman's "sophomoric films from the 40s."&lt;ref name=svenskfilmografi /&gt;

Bergman's international reputation, on the other hand, was largely cemented by ''The Seventh Seal''.&lt;ref name="BergmanReferenceGuide"/&gt; [[Bosley Crowther]] had only positive things to say in his 1958 review for ''[[The New York Times]]'', and praised how the themes were elevated by the cinematography and acting: "the profundities of the ideas are lightened and made flexible by glowing pictorial presentation of action that is interesting and strong. Mr. Bergman uses his camera and actors for sharp, realistic effects."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|authorlink=Bosley Crowther|last=Crowther|first=Bosley|date=14 October 1954|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1958/10/14/archives/seventh-seal-swedish-allegory-has-premiere-at-paris.html|title=Seventh Seal; Swedish Allegory Has Premiere at Paris|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=21 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The film is now regarded as a masterpiece of [[cinematography|cinema]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last =Ebert | first =Roger | authorlink =Roger Ebert | title =The Seventh Seal | work=RogerEbert.com| publisher=Ebert Digital LLC| date =16 April 2000 | url =https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/great-movie-the-seventh-seal-1957 | accessdate =18 August 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Empire (magazine)|Empire]]'' magazine ranked it the eighth-greatest film of world cinema in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = The 100 Best Films Of World Cinema - 8.

The film was selected as the Swedish entry for the [[Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film|Best Foreign Language Film]] at the [[30th Academy Awards]], but was not nominated.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}

On the [[review aggregator]] website [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the film holds an approval rating of 93% based on 54 reviews, with an average rating of 9.1/10. The website's critical consensus reads: "Narratively bold and visually striking, ''The Seventh Seal'' brought Ingmar Bergman to the world stage — and remains every bit as compelling today".&lt;ref name=rotten&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/seventh_seal/|title=The Seventh Seal (1957)|publisher=[[Fandango Media]] |work=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|accessdate=21 March 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170725024520/https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/seventh_seal/|archivedate=25 July 2017|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Impact==
''The Seventh Seal'' significantly helped Bergman in gaining his position as a world-class director. When the film won the [[Jury Prize (Cannes Festival)|Special Jury Prize]] at the [[1957 Cannes Film Festival]],&lt;ref name="festival-cannes.com"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.festival-cannes.com/en/archives/ficheFilm/id/3563/year/1957.html |title=Festival de Cannes: The Seventh Seal |accessdate=8 February 2009|work=festival-cannes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; the attention generated by it (along with the previous year's ''[[Smiles of a Summer Night]]'') made Bergman and his stars Max von Sydow and Bibi Andersson well-known to the European film community, and the critics and readers of ''[[Cahiers du Cinéma]]'', among others, discovered him with this movie.  Within five years of this, he had established himself as the first real [[auteur]] of Swedish cinema. With its images and reflections upon death and the meaning of life, ''The Seventh Seal'' had a symbolism that was "immediately apprehensible to people trained in literary culture who were just beginning to discover the 'art' of film, and it quickly became a staple of high school and college literature courses... Unlike Hollywood 'movies,' ''The Seventh Seal'' clearly was aware of elite artistic culture and thus was readily appreciated by intellectual audiences."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Monaco |first=James |authorlink= |title=How To Read a Film |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2000 |location= |pages=311–312 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=TSSfJb011QgC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |isbn=978-0-19-513981-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:DeathSeventhSeal.png|thumb|[[Bengt Ekerot]] as [[Death (personification)|Death]]]]
The representation of Death as a white-faced man who wears a dark cape and plays chess with mortals has been a popular object of parody in other films and television.

Several films and comedy sketches portray Death as playing games other than or in addition to chess. In the final scene of the 1968 film ''[[The Dove (1968 film)|De Düva]]'' (mock Swedish for "The Dove"), a 15-minute [[pastiche]] of Bergman's work generally and his ''[[Wild Strawberries (film)|Wild Strawberries]]'' in particular, the protagonist plays badminton against Death and wins when the droppings of a passing dove strike Death in the eye. Death's costume is also soiled, to his annoyance as he said it was just [[Dry cleaning|dry cleaned]].  The photography imitates throughout the style of Bergman's cinematographers Sven Nykqvist and Gunnar Fischer.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.slate.com/id/2171423/ Remembering De Düva (The Dove)], a 30 July 2007 ''Slate'' article&lt;/ref&gt;

The protagonists of the 1991 science-fiction comedy ''[[Bill &amp; Ted's Bogus Journey]]'' return to life by defeating Death (played by [[William Sadler (Actor)|William Sadler]]) at [[Battleship (game)|''Battleship'']], [[Cluedo|''Clue'']], [[electric football]], and [[Twister (game)|''Twister'']]. After each of the first three games, Death insists that the competition be extended to a "best-of-three," "-five," and then "-seven" series, but after being beaten in four games he concedes defeat.

In ''[[Last Action Hero]]'', Death (played by [[Ian McKellen]]) emerges from the film of the same name (''The Seventh Seal'').

In ''[[Monty Python and the Holy Grail]]'' the flagellant scene is depicted by monks smacking themselves in the head while reciting lines from the Dies Irae. In ''[[Monty Python's Meaning of Life]]'' Death appears at a dinner party in much the same guise. A few minutes later, in a parody of the "Dance of Death", we see the partygoers following Death through space.

In the animated feature ''[[Animalympics]]'', the film is alluded to as the newest cinematic project of actor and sports commentator Bjorn Freeborg, with one "Ingmar Birdman" (a nominal parody of the film's director) directing. This sequence utilizes the reproduction of a screenshot of the famous chess-play scene, with Freeborg playing the role of Death.

[[Woody Allen]]'s one-act play entitled ''Death Knocks'', part of his anthology ''Getting Even'', depicts a man playing [[gin rummy]] against Death. Allen, an enormous fan of Ingmar Bergman,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.time.com/time/arts/article/0,8599,1648917,00.html | work=Time | first=Richard | last=Corliss | title=Woody Allen on Ingmar Bergman | date=1 August 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; references Bergman's work in his serious dramas as well as his comedies;&lt;ref&gt;See {{Cite book |last=Girgus |first=Sam  |authorlink= |title=The Films of Woody Allen |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=2002 |location= |page=132 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=GZbcl1o3kOQC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |isbn=978-0-521-81091-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; his ''[[Love and Death]]'', a broad parody of 19th-century Russian novels, closes with a "Dance of Death" scene imitating Bergman's.

The film is also seen in the [[Håkan Bråkan (TV series)|Håkan Bråkan]], the 2003 SVT Christmas calendar series, based on works by [[Anders Jacobsson and Sören Olsson]]s, where Håkan watches the movie&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dn.se/kultur-noje/hakan-brakan-stor-julfriden/|title=Håkan Bråkan stör julfriden|publisher=Dagens nyheter|language=Swedish|author=Henrik Arvidsson|date=10 December 2003|accessdate=25 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; — even an animated version appears.

=== Popular music ===
The song "The Seventh Seal" on [[Scott Walker (singer)|Scott Walker]]'s 1969 album ''[[Scott 4]]'' is based on the film.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

The film is referred to in [[Bruce Cockburn|Bruce Cockburn]]'s song "How I Spent My Fall Vacation", from his 1979 album [[Humans (Bruce Cockburn album)|Humans]]. The song's narrative is bracketed by two young men watching the film in a cinema. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cockburnproject.net/songs&amp;music/hismfv.html |website=The Cockburn Project |accessdate=16 September 2018|title=Bruce Cockburn - Songs - How I Spent My Fall Vacation }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On ''[[Dance of Death (album)|Dance of Death]]'' (2003), the thirteenth studio album by British [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]] band [[Iron Maiden]], the album's title track was inspired by the final scene of ''The Seventh Seal'', at the end of which, according to guitarist [[Janick Gers]], "these figures on the horizon start doing a little jig, which is the dance of death.".&lt;ref name="Wall373"&gt;{{cite book |author=Wall, Mick |title=Iron Maiden: Run to the Hills, the Authorised Biography | edition = 3rd |publisher=Sanctuary Publishing |year=2004 |isbn=978-1-86074-542-3 |page=373 |authorlink=Mick Wall}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Opera===
In 2016 composer [[João MacDowell]]  premiered in [[New York City]] at [[Scandinavia House]] the music for the first act of "The Seventh Seal" a work in progress under contract with the [[Ingmar Bergman]] Foundation, sung in Swedish.

In the fictional universe of ''[[Warhammer 40,000]]'', the '''Tyranids''' are a race and a playable army in the tabletop miniatures wargame.

The Tyranids are aliens from outside the galaxy who have come to devour all life, one planet at a time.  They are collectively controlled by a highly intelligent hive mind which can not be reasoned with.  Tyranids come in diverse forms, each individual having been engineered to fulfill a specific role.  All of their technology is biological, named in the Universe as biomorphs due to their components being alive.

==In the miniature wargame==
[[File:Tyranid miniatures WH40K.jpg|right|thumb|Tyranid miniatures, for the wargame ''[[Warhammer 40,000]]''.]]
Tyranids are a playable army in the science-fiction-oriented [[Miniature wargaming|miniature wargame]] known as ''Warhammer 40,000''.

Tyranid infantry units tend to be fast, hard-hitting, but frail.  They are also cheap, meaning Tyranid armies in play tend to be large.

Tyranids have the most powerful counter-measures against enemies with psychic powers.  Many Tyranid units possess the "Shadow in the Warp" trait, which makes it harder for nearby enemy psykers to use their powers.

== Development ==
Tyranids were first described in Rick Priestley's ''[[Rogue Trader (Warhammer 40,000)|Rogue Trader]]'', the first edition of the ''Warhammer 40,000''.&lt;ref name="Rogue Trader"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Rogue Trader|first=Rick|last=Priestley|year=1992|publisher=Games Workshop|location=Eastwood|isbn=1-872372-27-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; At that time they were not an emphasized race in the game, instead representing a limited number of occasionally encountered alien antagonists. Their physical appearance was not imposing or especially horrific: they were depicted as six limbed, relatively diminutive creatures (an appearance which would later be assigned to Tyranid termagants). In later iterations of Warhammer 40,000-related products (starting with the release of [[Advanced Space Crusade]]) the Tyranids were given a complete makeover and became a major race, popularized by a number of successful expansions. 

Tyranids often form a fast-moving close-combat army that relies on overwhelming its enemies through waves and waves of mostly small but deadly creatures, while larger creatures provide a source of powerful attacks. They may also rely heavily on ranged combat, if different selections are made, or field an impressive but small array of monstrous titans rather than a typical swarm.  Tyranid armies are therefore able to bring a varied threat to bear on their opponents.

==History==

Games Workshop has introduced three main hive fleets, called Behemoth, Kraken, and Leviathan. The most recent Codex has also introduced a number of smaller hive fleets and splinter fleets, such as Hydra and Gorgon, among a number of others, although the book primarily focuses on the three main fleets. It is noted that these names are given by the scholars of the [[Imperium (Warhammer 40,000)|Imperium]], rather than the Tyranids themselves. In fact, there is no evidence in the fiction that Tyranids have language or civilization, at least not as understood by other species native to the [[Milky Way]]. In many stories, they communicate with a complex array of insectoid clicking and buzzing noises, as well as reptilian war cries, growls, and hissing sounds. Tyranids are thought to communicate primarily via a strong synaptic link to the so-called Hive Mind.

There have been three major Tyranid hive fleets to date; Hive Fleet Behemoth and Hive Fleet Kraken of whom both were defeated, and Hive Fleet Leviathan, which is one of the current threats to the known galaxy. There are many other Tyranid hive fleets that have been destroyed or are still emerging, such as Hive Fleets Jormungand, Colossus, Tiamet, Scarabus, Ouroboros, Nemesis,  Reatherus, Gorgon and  Hydra among many others.

Tyranids were first mentioned in the 1987 rulebook ''[[Warhammer 40,000: Rogue Trader]]'' under the heading ''Tyranids and the Hive Fleets'', and were illustrated in a form not too different from that of Gaunts.&lt;ref name="Rogue Trader"/&gt;

The first Tyranids used conventional, non-biological equipment such as lasguns and flak armor (although the rulebook stated that these represented organic equipment with similar capabilities).&lt;ref name="Genesis of the Tyranids"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://us.games-workshop.com/games/40k/tyranids/articles/genesis.htm |title=Genesis of the Tyranids |publisher=Games Workshop |accessdate=2007-04-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060505085830/http://us.games-workshop.com/games/40k/tyranids/articles/genesis.htm |archivedate=2006-05-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The principal unit available to the Tyranids was the [[Zoat]], a [[centaur]]-like creature enslaved to fight on the behalf of their Tyranid masters.

Games Workshop introduced the first [[Genestealer]] figures in 1989 in the game [[Space Hulk]]. The first recognizable incarnation of Tyranid warriors appeared in [[Advanced Space Crusade]] in 1990, featuring biological weaponry such as boneswords and deathspitters.&lt;ref name="Space Hulk"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Space Hulk|first=Dean| last=Bass|author2=Colston, Chris |year=1993|publisher=Games Workshop|location=Eastwood|id=ASIN: B000KOPQVO}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Second Edition ''Warhammer 40,000'', released in 1993, featured the Tyranids in the supplemental books ''Wargear'' and ''Codex Imperialis'', and then later in their own devoted army ''Codex''. An extensive model range was released, representing most of the units described in these publications. The army was, however, very different from the factions previously seen in the game.&lt;ref name="Codex Tyranids 2nd Edition"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Warhammer 40,000 Codex: Tyranids|first=Andy|last=Chambers|edition=2nd|publisher=Games Workshop|location=Nottingham|isbn=1-872372-90-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Tyranid player now had access to a range of unit types roughly equivalent to that of the other factions, including the ''Hive Tyrant'', ''Termagants'', ''Hormagaunts'', the main adversary in Space Hulk ''Genestealers'', ''Gargoyles'' previously seen in ''Epic 40,000'', ''Tyranid Warriors'', the ''Carnifex'', ''Zoanthropes'' (a Tyranid [[psyker]] in addition to the Hive Tyrant), ''Lictors'', and the ''Biovore''.

[[File:Tyranids Cover 3rd.jpg|thumb|right|Cover of the 3rd Edition '''Codex: Tyranids''']]

In the Tyranid supplement to Third Edition ''Warhammer 40,000'' there was an emphasis on revamping the rules for the various units while maintaining the overall structure of the army, so that veteran players would not find their older collections unusable or less useful in the new edition. The supplement did however add some new units and adjust the behavior of others. A brand-new model range, somewhat different from the older one, was released to coincide with the new publication.&lt;ref name="Codex Tyranids 3rd Edition"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Warhammer 40,000 Codex: Tyranids|first=Phil|last=Kelly|author2=Chambers, Andy |year=2002|edition=3rd|publisher=Games Workshop|location=Nottingham|isbn=1-84154-468-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; New units included: the ''Tyrant Guard'' and ''Raveners''.

The Third Edition Codex, as with a number of subsequent publications, included an army list which permitted far greater flexibility to the player than previous army lists, allowing extensive customization of units. Unit types noted as a 'Mutable Genus' in the main army list were permitted to be extensively modified by choosing from numerous options in the 'Custom Hive Fleet' section of the book. The options available bore a resemblance to the random equipment tables featured in ''Rogue Trader'', but were no longer randomized.

The nature of the army list in Third Edition further cemented the Tyranid army's reputation for fielding vast numbers of models, allowing the player to overwhelm an opponent with weight of numbers. This was even more pronounced in the variant ''Seeding Swarm'' army list published in White Dwarf and later in Chapter Approved, which represented the initial stages of a massive Tyranid assault and even further emphasized the use of many expendable, 'cannon-fodder' type units.&lt;ref name="Chapter Approved 2003"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Warhammer 40,000 Codex: Tyranids|first=Andy|last=Chambers|edition=1st|publisher=Games Workshop|location=Nottingham|isbn=1-84154-317-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The release of the fourth edition codex added a new model range, new rules, and new units, most notably the Broodlord, a larger alpha genestealer, and revamped units such as the Carnifex. This new codex also enables Tyranid players to field a total of eight large Tyranids to be deployed in a medium-sized battle, although the player would still have to field compulsory troop choices. With this concept Tyranid armies can now consist of many troops and/or a just few powerful units. One of the more overlooked abilities was the new "without number" rule, which allowed for an unlimited number of gaunts in a single game, emphasizing the "cannon-fodder" trait of the Tyranids.&lt;ref name="Codex Tyranids"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Warhammer 40,000 Codex: Tyranids|first=Phil|last=Kelly|author2=Chambers, Andy |year=2004|edition=4th|publisher=Games Workshop|location=Nottingham|isbn=1-84154-650-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A new Tyranid codex was released on 16 January 2010, written by Robin Cruddance. It included 15 new species of Tyranid, and legendary heroes like the Swarmlord, Old One Eye and the Doom of Malan'tai.  In addition, some models saw a point cost reduction, which allowed certain Tyranid armies to field more units, although this was not the case for all Tyranid units.  The Carnifex, a mainstay of previous editions, saw its point cost almost double, with many of its options removed and with no corresponding increase in effectiveness.

The Tyranids received new rules for the eighth edition of Warhammer 40,000 in Index: Xenos 2, released in June 2017. An updated version of these rules will be released on 11 November 2017 in the new Codex: Tyranids.

==Fictional in-game history==

The first recorded contact between the Imperium and the Tyranids was in 745.M41 on the Eastern Fringes of the Milky Way galaxy. There are rumors that the Ordo Xenos of the Inquisition had identified possible appearances of the Tyranids as far back as the 35th Millennium.

The Tyranids emerged from the intergalactic space of the Local Group of galaxies, their Hive Mind drawn to the Milky Way by the psychic beacon of the Astronomican transmitted by the Imperium of Man's Emperor. The first officially recorded contact with the Tyranids for the Imperium of Man came during an attack on the Forge World of Tyran by hive fleet Behemoth, and from there the fleet continued through the Ultramar sector of imperial space, consuming all the worlds in its path. The Tyranids were defeated, by the efforts of the Ultramarines Chapter of Space Marines and suffered devastating losses
during the Battle of Macragge 

In 942.M41, Commissar [[Ciaphas Cain]], on a mission in the Ice World, Nusquam {{not a typo|Fundumentibus}}, discovered hibernating Tyranids buried deep in the permafrost; the swarm was apparently carried to the planet by a Hive Ship that had crashed on the planet, prior to any human colonization. The Inquisition was unsettled by the fact that the Tyranids possibly developed a presence in the galaxy before the start of the Imperium; it is unknown whether the crashed bio-ship was on a scouting mission when it was lost, was a casualty in a pre-Imperium Tyranid invasion force that was defeated by unknown adversaries, or part of a plan by a Tyranid super-intelligence that may have "seeded" the galaxy with many slumbering broods.

In 993.M41, the Tyranids returned to the Milky Way with Hive Fleet Kraken, changing tactics from assaulting targets as a single massed Hive Fleet to instead splitting into smaller fleets, each enveloping star systems before reinforcements can arrive. The brunt of this new attack was borne by the Space Marine Chapters known as the Scythes of the Emperor and the Lamenters. Eventually the backbone of the Hive Fleet was broken by its defeats at the Battle of Ichar IV and at the Eldar Craftworld Iyanden. The cost to the Imperium was still great, Craftworld Iyanden lost more than half of its population, and many splinter fleets broke off from Kraken to later wreak havoc deep within Imperial space.

In 997.M41, Hive Fleet Leviathan appeared from "below" the plane of the galaxy (on the Z axis) and attacked from two points, cutting off large portions of the galaxy from reinforcements. It threatened the defenses of the Segmentum Solar and Terra, the capital of the Imperium of Man, but the Tyranids were distracted by being deflected into the star system of a powerful Ork empire. The Orks are managing to stem the main Tyranid Hive Fleet's advance.

== The Battle for Macragge ==

The Tyranids were a major race in the fourth edition of Warhammer 40k, especially due to their presence in the Battle for Macragge [[Warhammer 40,000|boxed game]], released in 2004. The set included six Genestealers, ten Termagants, and eight Spore Mines. The box set represented the Battle for Macragge, one of the most detailed battles for both the Tyranids and the Ultramarines Chapter of [[Space Marines (Warhammer 40,000)|Space Marines]].

Famed for their close combat attacks, Tyranids were chosen to be the aliens who set about destroying the [[Space Marines (Warhammer 40,000)|Ultramarines]] homeworld of Macragge. In the preceding months Hive Fleet Behemoth (The Hive Fleet responsible) had been scouring the Ultramar sector leaving dead and barren planets in their wake, so when they arrived at Macragge they found a planet ready for battle. As well as Macragge's Starnova defense stations, the planet's defenses were bolstered by fleets seeking revenge, wanting to protect their homeworlds and some because they could do nothing else with their helms manned by those loyal to Marneus Calgar, Chapter Master of the Ultramarines. When Behemoth arrived at Macragge it fought with all its might in space and on land to subdue and consume the Ultramarines. This led to a fateful stand on Cold Steel Ridge. The Hive Mind dispatched its deadliest servant to the front lines - the Swarmlord, an ancient Hive Tyrant whose consciousness had been reincarnated through countless battles. This beast had struck the final blow on many worlds against many foes, and as soon as it stepped onto the battlefield, the swarm's ferocity was paired with keen strategy. It rent and tore the chapter master and left him lying on the ground. In the end, only the battleship Dominus Astra detonating its warp drives in the heart of the Tyranid fleet succeeded in destroying the central Tyranid hive ship, the lynchpin of the aliens' psychic control, throwing the swarm into disarray and putting an end to the invasion. Even though the Tyranids failed in their attempt, among the innumerable lives taken and damage caused both in space and on the ground, they managed to wipe out all one hundred members of the Ultramarines' elite 1st Company during a desperate last stand to defend one of the planet's two polar orbital defense facilities, a feat never before accomplished, and never repeated since, by any other enemy of the Imperium.

The Tyranids are represented in three of the '''Specialist Games''' produced by '''[[Games Workshop]]''': '''[[Battlefleet Gothic|Battlefleet: Gothic]]''', '''[[Epic (game)|Epic]]''', and '''[[Inquisitor (game)|Inquisitor]]'''.

In '''Battlefleet: Gothic''', a game focusing on spaceship to spaceship fleet combat, they are represented by four models that represent the massive biologically constructed ships of the Tyranid Hivefleet.&lt;ref name="Official Specialist Games Website"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.specialist-games.com | title= Specialist Games| publisher=Games Workshop|  accessdate=2007-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; In '''Epic''', the game of large scale combat using smaller miniatures, they are represented by a combination of [[Tyranid Titans (Warhammer 40,000)|Titans]] and standard Tyranid troops.&lt;ref name="Trial Tyranid Rules for Epic"&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.specialist-games.com/assets/FinalNidv7.pdf | title = Trial Tyranid Epic Rules | publisher = Games Workshop | accessdate = 2007-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Games-Workshop Online Store"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://uk.games-workshop.com/storefront/store.uk | title=Games-Workshop Online Store | publisher=Games Workshop | accessdate=2007-05-29 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070530125424/http://uk.games-workshop.com/storefront/store.uk | archivedate=2007-05-30 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In '''Inquisitor''', the narrative skirmish game using ''Warhammer 40,000'' type characters, the Tyranids are represented by the [[Genestealer]] and [[Genestealer#Hybrids|Hybrid]] models&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://uk.games-workshop.com/storefront/store.uk| title=Games-Workshop Online Store| publisher=Games Workshop| accessdate=2007-05-29| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070530125424/http://uk.games-workshop.com/storefront/store.uk| archivedate=2007-05-30| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; under the generic roleplaying category of "aliens." They are individual members of the [[Genestealer#Genestealer Cultists|Genestealer Cults]] who work towards espionage and propagating their species in secret to weaken a planet's defenses before an invasion, as opposed to being part of the Hivefleet army that seeks to swarm over all in their path and consume them.&lt;ref name="Official Specialist Games Website"/&gt;

== In video games ==

[[Warhammer 40,000: Dawn of War II]] currently includes Tyranids as a playable race along with the Imperial Guard, Chaos Space Marines, Eldar, Orks, and Space Marines. The playable "heroes" (commander units) include the Hive Tyrant, Ravener Alpha and Lictor Alpha, and the forces of a Tyranid splinter fleet act as the primary antagonists in the single player campaign; the campaign is only playable from the point of view of the Blood Raven chapter of Space Marines.&lt;ref name="Official Dawn of War Multiplayer Details"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.dawnofwar2.com/us/info/multiplayer/tyranids | title= Game Info/ Multiplayer| accessdate=2009-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in the expansion ''Retribution'', they are a playable race in the single-player Campaign. 
Notably, the Tyranids are one of the few ''Warhammer 40,000'' factions that were not in the first game, [[Warhammer 40000: Dawn of War]]. The fact that Tyranids were not present is likely due to their nature; as Tyranids do not create structures or technology in the same way as the other races (not to mention the lack of usable wargear because of this), it would be difficult to have them perform as the other races do in the game. Relic has also repeatedly stated {{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} that they wanted to include the Tyranids in Dawn Of War, but the game's graphic engine "wouldn't do them justice". Other issues cited included significant differences in economy. The altered overall game mechanics of the aforementioned sequel, together with improved graphical capabilities of later computers apparently allowed them to depict Tyranids in a manner the developers found acceptable.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6150">'''Æthelstan Half-King''' (fl. 932 – 956) was an important and influential [[Ealdorman]] of [[East Anglia]] who interacted with five kings of England, including his adopted son [[Edgar the Peaceful]]. Many of Æthelstan's close relatives were also involved in important affairs, but soon after the death of king [[Eadred]] in 955, he left his position and became a monk at [[Glastonbury Abbey]].

==Origins==
Æthelstan was the son of [[Æthelfrith of Mercia|Æthelfrith]] an Ealdorman, who held lands in [[Somerset]], [[Berkshire]], and [[Middlesex]].&lt;ref&gt;Henson, pp. 125 &amp; 127; {{PASE|9007|Æthelfrith 3}}, retrieved 2007-01-28; Stenton, p. 351.&lt;/ref&gt; His mother was Æthelgyth, daughter of Æthelwulf.&lt;ref&gt;{{PASE|9117|Æthelgyth 1}}, retrieved 2007-01-28&lt;/ref&gt; His brothers Ælfstan, Æthelwald, and [[Eadric, Ealdorman of Wessex|Eadric]], were Ealdormen of [[Mercia]], of [[Kent]], and of [[Wessex]], respectively.&lt;ref&gt;Henson, pp. 125&amp;ndash;127; Miller.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The rise of Æthelstan's family began in the reign of King [[Edward the Elder]], when Æthelfrith, whose family background is presumed to lie in Wessex, was appointed an Ealdorman in southern Mercia. Mercia was then ruled by Edward's sister [[Æthelflæd]] and her husband [[Æthelred, Earl of Mercia|Æthelred]].

==Career==
Æthelstan seems to have been appointed Ealdorman of East Anglia and other parts by King [[Æthelstan]] in about 932. The lands King Æthelstan gave him had mostly been part of the [[Danelaw]] which had only been forced out of the area after the [[Battle of Tempsford]] in [[Bedfordshire]] fifteen years earlier in 917. Æthelstan's brother Ælfstan became Ealdorman of some parts of Mercia at about the same time and both of them may have participated in king Æthelstan's invasion of Scotland in 934. His other brothers, Eadric and Æthelwald, were witnessing charters as Ealdormen by 940.

Æthelstan and his family were supporters of the monastic reforms of [[Saint Dunstan]] which introduced the [[Benedictine]] rule to Glastonbury. Both Glastonbury, and [[Abingdon Abbey]], were endowed by Æthelstan.&lt;ref&gt;Higham, p. 4; Williams.&lt;/ref&gt;

Æthelstan's wife was named Ælfwynn. Her family came from the east Midlands. She was foster-mother of King [[Edgar of England]]. Ælfwynn's lands would later endow [[Ramsey Abbey]], refounded by Bishop [[Æthelwold of Winchester]], Bishop [[Oswald of Worcester]], and Æthelstan's son Æthelwine. [[Byrhtferth]] of Ramsey, author of a ''Life of Saint Oswald'' in the early 11th century, devoted considerable space to Æthelstan's family, several of whom were buried at Ramsey. The epithet Half-King comes from Byrhtferth's writings. Several members of the family were buried, or reburied, at Ramsey.

The position of Æthelstan and his brothers in the middle of the 10th century has been compared with the similar dominance of the family of [[Godwin, Earl of Wessex]] in the 11th century.&lt;ref&gt;Higham, p. 4; Miller; Williams.&lt;/ref&gt; It is possible that Æthelstan's withdrawal to Glastonbury may not have been voluntary.&lt;ref&gt;Higham, p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the death of Æthelwald in 962 resulted in the family's offices in Wessex passing to their chief rivals, the family of Ealdorman [[Ælfhere]]. The result of this was that the two families were roughly equal in influence. Ælfhere's death in the early 970s did not result in a return of the old dominance of Æthelstan's family.&lt;ref&gt;Higham, pp. 5 &amp; 68&amp;ndash;69.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Family==

People associated with Æthelstan's family include Ealdorman [[Byrhtnoth]], whose defeat at the [[Battle of Maldon]] is commemorated in [[The Battle of Maldon|verse]].&lt;ref&gt;Higham, p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt;

Æthelstan's children included:
* [[Æthelwald, Ealdorman of East Anglia|Æthelwald]] (died c. 962), Ealdorman of Essex, then of East Anglia after his father became a monk. Queen [[Ælfthryth, Queen of England|Ælfthryth]], daughter of Ealdorman [[Ordgar]], who was later the third wife of King Edgar, was first married to Æthelwald.
* Ælfwald, called ''dux'' in charters.&lt;ref&gt;Byrhtferth of Ramsey (''The Life of Saint Oswald'', iii, 14) writes of Ælfwald: "He was exalted with such great authority, that he even disdained to become an ealdorman; {{PASE|8092|Ælfwald 42}}, retrieved 2007-01-28.  Ælfwald was a prominent supporter of the monasteries and ordered the death of one Leofsige who was attempting to claim lands belonging to the monastery of [[Peterborough]].&lt;/ref&gt; 
* Æthelwig, Ealdorman.
* Æthelsige, became king Edgar's [[Chamberlain (office)|chamberlain]] (died c.986).
* [[Æthelwine, Ealdorman of East Anglia|Æthelwine]] (died 992), Ealdorman of East Anglia after Æthelwald, youngest son of Æthelstan. Chief Ealdorman from 983.&lt;ref&gt;Byrhtferth of Ramsey (''The Life of Saint Oswald'', iii, 14) presents Æthelwine as a key supporter of the monasteries in land disputes, along with Ælfwald; Miller; Williams.&lt;/ref&gt;
