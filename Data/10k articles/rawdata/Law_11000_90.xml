The '''1916 Zoning Resolution''' in [[New York City]]  was the first citywide zoning code in the US. The zoning resolution reflected both borough and local interests, and was proposed after the development of 120 Broadway (the [[Equitable Building (Manhattan)|Equitable Building]]) in [[lower Manhattan]]. It was a measure adopted primarily to stop massive buildings from preventing light and air from reaching the streets below, and established limits in building [[massing]] at certain heights, usually interpreted as a series of [[Setback (architecture)|setbacks]] and, while not imposing height limits, restricted towers to a percentage of the lot size. The chief authors of this resolution were [[George McAneny]] and [[Edward M. Bassett]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Dunlap|first1=David W.|author-link1=David W. Dunlap|title=Zoning Arrived 100 Years Ago. It Changed New York City Forever.|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/26/nyregion/new-yorks-first-zoning-resolution-which-brought-order-to-a-chaotic-building-boom-turns-100.html?_r=0|date=July 26, 2016|newspaper = [[The New York Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Impact==
The 1916 Zoning Resolution had a major impact on [[urban development]] in the US and internationally.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www1.nyc.gov/site/planning/zoning/background.page|title=Background|website=www1.nyc.gov|access-date=2017-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Architectural delineator [[Hugh Ferriss]] popularized these new regulations in 1922 through a series of massing studies, clearly depicting the possible forms and how to maximize building volumes. "By the end of the 1920s the setback skyscraper, originally built in response to a New York zoning code, became a style that caught on from Chicago to Shanghai," observe Eric Peter Nash and Norman McGrath,&lt;ref&gt;Nash and McGrath, ''Manhattan Skyscrapers'' 2005:55.&lt;/ref&gt; discussing the [[Williamsburgh Savings Bank Building]], which rose in isolation in [[Brooklyn]], where no such zoning dictated form.  The tiered [[Art Deco]] skyscrapers of the 1920s and 1930s are a direct result of this resolution.

==Legacy==
By mid-century most new [[International Style (architecture)|International Style]] buildings had met the setback requirements by adopting the use of plazas or low-rise buildings surrounding a monolithic tower centered on the site. This approach was criticized.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news 
  | last = Dunlap  | first = David W.  | title = At New Trade Center, Seeking Lively (but Secure) Streets
  | newspaper = The New York Times  | date = December 7, 2006  | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2006/12/07/nyregion/07blocks.html  | accessdate = 2008-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1961 the city reformed its zoning ordinance. The new zoning solution used the [[Floor Area Ratio]] (FAR) regulation instead of setback rules. A building’s maximum floor area is regulated according to the ratio that was imposed to the site where the building is located. Another feature of new zoning solution was adjacent public open space. If developers put adjacent public open space to their buildings, they could get additional area for their building as a bonus. This incentive bonus rule was created because of the strong influence from two representative skyscrapers. The [[Seagram building]] by [[Mies van der Rohe]] with [[Philip Johnson]], and the [[Lever House]] by [[Skidmore, Owings &amp; Merrill]] introduced the new ideas about office building with open space. These buildings changed the skyline of New York City with both the advent of simple glass box design and their treatment of adjacent open spaces. The new zoning encouraged privately owned public space to ease the density of the city.&lt;ref&gt;W. Bressi, Todd (1993). Planning and Zoning New York City. Rutgers, the State University of New Jersey. pp. 9–12.&lt;/ref&gt;

The term '''aggravated felony''' was created by the [[United States Congress]] as part of the [[Immigration and Nationality Act]] (INA) to define a special category of [[crime|criminal offenses]].&lt;ref name=a-f-1988/&gt;&lt;ref name=a-f-1996/&gt; The INA says that some [[alien (law)#United States|aliens]] "convicted of an aggravated felony shall be considered to have been convicted of a [[particularly serious crime]]."&lt;ref name="particularly serious crime"/&gt; Every "legal immigrant," including a "[[national of the United States|national]] but not a citizen of the United States,"&lt;ref name="nationals but not citizens of the United States"/&gt; who has been convicted of any aggravated felony is statutorily barred from obtaining [[citizenship of the United States]].&lt;ref name=1101(a)(19)/&gt;&lt;ref name=1101(f)(8)/&gt;&lt;ref name=1427(d)-(e)/&gt;&lt;ref name="a-f-1996"/&gt;&lt;ref name=OPA/&gt;&lt;ref name=OPA2/&gt; Other than a [[refugee]],&lt;ref name="Matter of H-N-"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Matter of J-H-J-"/&gt;&lt;ref name=refugee/&gt; every alien who has been convicted of any aggravated felony is statutorily barred from receiving a [[visa policy of the United States|visa]] or being admitted to the United States, unless its "term of [[imprisonment]] was completed within the previous 15 years."&lt;ref name=a-f-1996/&gt;&lt;ref name="aliens previously removed"&gt;{{uscsub|8|1182|a|9|A|iii}} ("Clauses (i) and (ii) '''''shall not apply''''' to an alien seeking admission within a period if, prior to the date of the alien's reembarkation at a place outside the United States or attempt to be admitted from foreign contiguous territory, '''''the Attorney General has consented''''' to the alien's reapplying for admission.")

In 1986, less than a year before the [[United Nations Convention against Torture]] (CAT) became effective, Congress expressly and intentionally expanded the definition of "[[national of the United States|nationals]] but not [[citizenship of the United States|citizens of the United States]]" by adding paragraph (4) to 8 U.S.C. § 1408, which reads as follows:{{Quote|Unless otherwise provided in section [https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/8/1401 1401] of this title, the following ''shall'' be '''''nationals, but not citizens, of the United States''''' at birth: .... (4) '''''A person''''' born outside the United States '''''and''''' its [[territories of the United States|outlying possessions]] of parents one of whom is an [[alien (law)#United States|alien]], and the other a '''''national, but not a citizen, of the United States''''' who, prior to the birth of such person, was physically present in the '''''United States''''' or its outlying possessions for a period or periods &lt;u&gt;totaling not less than seven years in any continuous period of ten years&lt;/u&gt;—(A) '''''during which the [[national of the United States|national]] [[parent]] was not outside the United States''''' or its outlying possessions '''''for a continuous period of more than one year''''', and (B) at least five years of which were after attaining the age of fourteen years.&lt;ref name="nationals but not citizens of the United States"&gt;{{USC|8|1408}} (emphasis added); see also {{USC|8|1436}} ("Nationals but not citizens....").&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Alabama v.

In ''Popal v.

According to {{USC|8|1326}}, it is a federal [[crime]] for any non-criminal alien to illegally enter the United States after that alien has been denied entry, excluded, removed, deported, or if he or she has departed the United States while an order of removal was outstanding. The maximum sentence for this crime is 2 years of [[imprisonment]]. However, if he or she was a criminal alien and "whose removal was subsequent to a conviction for commission of three or more [[classes of offenses under United States federal law|misdemeanors]] involving drugs, crimes against the person, or both, or a [[classes of offenses under United States federal law|felony]] (other than an aggravated felony), such alien shall be fined under title 18, imprisoned not more than 10 years, or both."&lt;ref&gt;{{uscsub|8|1326|b|1}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The penalty can be increased to as high as 20 years of imprisonment in the case of an alien convicted for illegally reentering the United States after he or she was lawfully deported as an aggravated felon. Such penalty, however, is extremely rare since no alien has received that many years of imprisonment. Most defendants in such cases receive around 5 years of imprisonment. In ''[[Almendarez-Torres v. United States]]'', {{ussc|523|224|1998}}, the U.S. Supreme Court held that this increased maximum sentence did not violate the [[Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Sixth Amendment]] to the U.S. Constitution. The only person saved from guilt and serving any imprisonment for illegal reentry after deportation is someone like the [[petitioner]] in ''United States v. Aguilera-Rios'', [https://casetext.com/case/united-states-v-aguilera-rios-2#p629 769 F.3d 626], 628-29 (9th Cir. 2014), who "was not originally removable as charged, and so could not be convicted of illegal reentry."

'''''Allcard v Skinner''''' (1887) 36 Ch D 145 is a judicial decision under [[English law]] dealing with [[undue influence in English law|undue influence]]. 

==Facts==
Miss Allcard was introduced by the Revd Mr Nihill to Miss Skinner, a lady superior of a religious order named "Protestant Sisters of the Poor". She had to observe vows of [[poverty]] and [[Vow of obedience|obedience]]. Three days after becoming a member, Miss Allcard made a will bequeathing all property to Miss Skinner, and passed on railway [[Shares|stock]] that she came into possession of in 1872 and 1874. She then claimed the money back after she left the sisterhood.

==Judgement==
[[Nathaniel Lindley, Baron Lindley|Lindley LJ]], held that she was unduly influenced but barred by [[Laches (equity)|laches]] from getting restitution. And in any case she would only have been able to recover as much of the gift as remained in the defendant’s hands after some of it had been spent in accordance with her wishes.&lt;ref&gt;at 182-3&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:LordLindley cropp.jpg|thumb|right|Lord Lindley.]]
{{Cquote|What then is the principle? Is it that it is right and expedient to save persons from the consequences of their own folly? or is it that it is right and expedient to save them from being victimised by other people? In my opinion the doctrine of undue influence is founded upon the second of these two principles. Courts of Equity have never set aside gifts on the ground of the folly, imprudence, or want of foresight on the part of donors. The Courts have always repudiated any such jurisdiction. ''[[Huguenin v Baseley]]'' 14 Ves 273 is itself a clear authority to this effect. It would obviously be to encourage folly, recklessness, extravagance and vice if persons could get back property which they foolishly made away with, whether by giving it to charitable institutions or by bestowing it on less worthy objects. On the other hand, to protect people from being forced, tricked or misled in any way by others into parting with their property is one of the most legitimate objects of all laws; and the equitable doctrine of undue influence has grown out of and been developed by the necessity of grappling with insidious forms of spiritual tyranny and with the infinite varieties of fraud.}}

[[Henry Cotton (judge)|Cotton LJ]] said,
{{Cquote|First where the court has been satisfied that the gift was the result of influence expressly used by the donee for the purpose; second, where the relations between the donor and donee have at or shortly before the execution of the gift been such as to raise a presumption that the donee had influence over the donor.}}

'''BLIPS''' is an [[acronym]] for ''Bond Linked Issue Premium Structure'', or ''Bond Linked Investment Premium Strategy''. It is a type of tax shelter involving investors who take out bank loans that the government considers illegitimate. These loans are then shifted to partnerships to claim tax losses.&lt;ref&gt;Lynnley Browning, Judge Rules a Tax Shelter in KPMG Case Is Legitimate, ''[[The New York Times]]'', July 21, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

BLIPS are invalid in the eyes of the [[Internal Revenue Service]] (IRS).&lt;ref&gt;''Vaughn v. United States IRS'', 765 F.3d 1174, 1177 (10th Cir. 2014).&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
BLIPS represent one of four abusive tax shelters that the [[Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations]] investigated in 2003. The Subcomittee found that [[KPMG]] had sold to at least 350 people from 1997 to 2001, earning fees of $124 million. Those shelters cost the Treasury at least $1.4 billion in unpaid taxes, according to the subcommittee. In the investigation, KPMG argued that investors knew they were taking a risk that the IRS might not accept the claims.&lt;ref&gt;''Becnel v. KPMG LLP'', 387 F. Supp. 2d 984, 2005-2 U.S. Tax Cas. (CCH) paragr. 50,573 (W.D. Ark. 2005) (Federal court had subject matter jurisdiction, based on "substantial federal question," in connection with controversy removed from Arkansas state court to Federal district court).&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''British and Irish Association of Law Librarians''' ('''BIALL,''' http://www.biall.org.uk/) is a professional body which represents information professionals working with legal information. BIALL is a self-supporting association which draws its income primarily from membership subscriptions.

== History ==
BIALL was set up in 1969 following workshops on law librarianship held at [[Harrogate]] in 1968 and 1969. Two strands led to the formation of BIALL. Firstly, the law librarians in London, Oxford, Cambridge and Ireland had been in contact and working together since the late 1940s, reinforced by their membership of the International Association of Law Librarians (IALL).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iall.org/ International Association of Law Librarians]&lt;/ref&gt; Secondly, the outreach programme of [[Leeds Polytechnic|Leeds Library School]] led to one of the School’s staff, Don Daintree, organising Workshops on Law Librarianship in Harrogate in 1968 and 1969. They brought together the foremost law library figures as speakers and those few people who were working in law libraries as students of the Workshops.  The inspiration for the Workshops was the [[Chartered Institute of Library and Information Professionals|Library Association]]’s List C papers on the bibliography and librarianship of subjects.

The 1st Harrogate Workshop in February was held at the Russell Hotel and a meeting at the end of the Workshop set up an ad hoc Committee to look into the possibility of establishing an association of law librarians. Committee members were [[Wallace Breem]], Don Daintree, [[Betty Moys]], Willi Steiner and Derek Way. The 2nd Harrogate Workshop in April concluded with a meeting which set up an Association of Law Librarians. This was the inaugural meeting and those who were present are BIALL’s founder members. The first AGM was held in a basement room of the old IALS building in [[Russell Square]] on Monday 22 September. It was chaired by Willi Steiner, several hours were spent debating the minutiae of the draft Constitution. One of the decisions was to form a separate organisation, not affiliated to, or part of, the Library Association, resulting from strong arguments that organisations (especially law firms) who had no professional librarians, would be excluded from membership if the Association were part of the LA. The principle of welcoming professionally qualified and non-qualified law librarians into BIALL has prevailed ever since.

The first officers were Don Daintree (Chairman), [[Wallace Breem]] (Secretary and Treasurer) and Betty Moys (Editor). An Executive Committee was subsequently elected and in November it set up a Sub-Committee of Betty Moys, Allan Appleby of [[Sweet and Maxwell]], and [[Wallace Breem]] to produce a journal.

== BIALL Conference ==

BIALL organises an annual Conference&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://biall.org.uk/annual-conference/|title=BIALL Conference|last=|first=|date=|website=BIALL|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=10 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; every year which all BIALL members are invited to attend. The Conference is an opportunity to listen to talks delivered by Legal Information Professionals and Industry experts as well as network with colleagues. The most recent Conference took place in [[Birmingham]] on 7th-9th June 2018, with the next conference (the 50th anniversary of both the organisation, and the conference) taking place in [[Bournemouth]] in June 2019.

Previous Conferences have taken place in [[Manchester]] (2017), [[Dublin]] (2016), [[Brighton]] (2015), [[Harrogate]] (2014), [[Glasgow]] (2013), [[Belfast]] (2012), [[Gateshead]] (2011), [[Brighton]] (2010), [[Manchester]] (2009), [[Dublin]] (2008), [[Sheffield]] (2007), [[Brighton]] (2006), [[Harrogate]] (2005),  [[Edinburgh]] (2004), and [[Cardiff]] (2003).

== Awards and other activities ==

BIALL administers and presents several awards at its annual conference dinner including the BIALL Supplier of the Year Award, the LexisLibrary Awards (formerly the Halsbury's Awards), the biannual [[Wallace Breem]] Award, the [[Betty Moys]] Award, the Legal Journals Award, and the Wildy Law Librarian of the Year Award.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://biall.org.uk/awards-2/|title=BIALL Awards|last=|first=|date=|website=BIALL|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=10 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Captive killer whales''' are live [[killer whales]] (Orcinus orca) which are held in [[Captivity (animal)|captivity]] by humans, often for breeding or performance purposes. The practice of capturing and displaying these whales in exhibitions began in the 1960s, soon becoming popular attractions at [[public aquarium]]s and [[marine mammal park|aquatic theme parks]] due to their intelligence, trainability, striking appearance, playfulness, and sheer size. As of September, 2016, there were 56 [[List of captive orcas|orcas in captivity worldwide]], 33 of which are captive-born.&lt;ref&gt;[http://us.whales.org/wdc-in-action/fate-of-captive-orcas-in-2014 The Fate of Captive Orcas in 2014]&lt;/ref&gt; There are 13 live orcas in the Seaworld parks.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}

The practice of keeping killer whales in captivity is controversial, due to the separation of their familial "pod" during capture, and their living conditions and health in captivity.&lt;ref name="Orcas in captivity"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wdcs.org/dan/publishing.nsf/allweb/A141A8A02A2FE3C7802568F60029D1F9 |title=Orcas in captivity |publisher=Whale and Dolphin Conservation Society |accessdate=July 25, 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070805220554/http://www.wdcs.org/dan/publishing.nsf/allweb/A141A8A02A2FE3C7802568F60029D1F9 |archivedate=August 5, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  There have been 4 human deaths involving orcas as of 2018, 3 of which involved a whale called [[Tilikum (orca)|Tilikum]]. Of the reported [[killer whale attack|killer whale attacks]] in the wild, none have been fatal.

Killer whales are large, active and intelligent. Males range from {{Convert|6|to|9.7|m|0|abbr=on}} and weigh over {{Convert|8|tonne}}, while females range from {{Convert|5|to|7|m|abbr=on}} and weigh {{Convert|3|to|5|tonne}}.&lt;ref name=Baird2002&gt;{{Cite book|last=Baird|first=Robin W|year=2002|title=Killer whales of the world: natural history and conservation|isbn=0-89658-512-3|publisher=Voyageur Press|location=Stillwater, Minnesota}}&lt;/ref&gt; The killer whale (''Orcinus orca'') is the largest species of the Dolphin family. The species is found in all the world's oceans, from the frigid [[Arctic]] and [[Antarctica|Antarctic]] regions to warm, tropical seas. Killer whales are intelligent, versatile and opportunistic predators.

==Capture and breeding==
It is extremely difficult to capture killer whales and to provide a healthy environment for the captives. Early attempts in the 1960s caused many injuries and deaths. However, with experience the teams who specialized in the business became more adept and post-capture survival rates improved. Live captures peaked in the early 1970s, but have become increasingly rare as the marine parks have learned how to maintain theme park populations through captive breeding and artificial insemination.

During the 1960s and early 1970s, nearly 50 killer whales were taken from Pacific waters for exhibition. The Southern Resident community of the Northeast Pacific lost 48 of its members to captivity. By 1976, only 80 killer whales were left in the community, which remains endangered. With subsequent captures, the theme parks learned more about avoiding injury during capture and subsequent care of killer whales, and discovered that they could be trained to perform tricks, making them a great attraction to visitors. As commercial demand increased, growing numbers of Pacific orcas were captured, peaking in 1970.&lt;ref name="Heimlich"&gt;Heimlich, Sara and Boran, James. ''Killer Whales'' (2001) Voyageur Press, Stillwater, Minnesota.&lt;/ref&gt;

A turning point came with a mass capture of orcas from the L-25 pod in August 1970 at Penn Cove, Puget Sound off the coast of [[Washington (U.S. state)|Washington]]. The Penn Cove capture became controversial due to the large number of wild killer whales that were taken (seven) and the number of deaths that resulted: four juveniles died, as well as one adult female who drowned when she became tangled in a net while attempting to reach her calf. In his interview for the [[CNN]] documentary ''[[Blackfish (film)|Blackfish]]'', former diver John Crowe told how all five of the whales had their abdomen slit open and filled with rocks, their tails weighted down with anchors and chains, in an attempt to conceal the deaths.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Aguilar|first=Rose|title=Blackfish: Highlighting the plight of captive orcas|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/opinion/2013/10/blackfish-highlighting-plight-captive-orcas-201310256590532291.html|work=[[Aljazeera]]|publisher=Aljazeera Satellite Network|accessdate=November 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The facts surrounding their deaths were discovered three months later after three of the dead whales washed ashore on [[Whidbey Island]]. Public concern about the welfare of the animals and the effect of captures on the wild pods led to the [[Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972|Marine Mammal Protection Act]] being passed in 1972 by the [[United States Congress|US Congress]], protecting orcas from being harassed or killed, and requiring special permits for capture. Since then, few wild orcas have been captured in Northeastern Pacific waters.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.inkokomo.com/dolphin/orca.html "The Capture of Orcas"] In Kokomo.

===Icelandic captures===
[[File:Keiko-weighing.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Keiko is weighed as he is loaded into his specially made transport tank at the Oregon State Aquarium, on September 9, 1998.]]

When the US Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972 effectively stopped the capture of Pacific orcas, exhibitors found an area more tolerant of killer whale captures in [[Iceland]]. Icelandic herring fishermen had traditionally seen killer whales as competitors for their catch, and sale of live killer whales promised a large new source of income. 48 live killer whales captured in Icelandic waters were exported to marine parks between 1976 and 1988. The capture process was based on luring the orcas by dumping leftovers from [[herring]] fishing in front of the pod, capturing the killer whales in a [[purse seine]] net, selecting desirable animals and hauling them on board in a specially designed frame, then placing them in foam-lined boxes full of seawater.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.orcahome.de/iceland.htm ''The Icelandic live-capture fishery for killer whales 1976–1988''] Orca Home. Retrieved March 7, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; However, restrictions on US killer whale import permits and advances in captive breeding programs meant that the market never became as large as expected. Growing concern from [[conservationists]] and [[animal rights activists]] has caused the Icelandic government to limit the number of orcas that may be captured each year.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/whales/keiko/world.html "A Whale of a Business"] PBS, Reproduced from "The Performing Orca, Why the Show Must Stop" by [[Erich Hoyt]]. Retrieved February 14, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

Perhaps the best known of the Icelandic captives is [[Keiko (orca)|Keiko]], caught in 1979 and sold to the Icelandic aquarium in [[Hafnarfjörður]]. Three years later, he was sold to Marineland Canada, where he first started performing for the public and developed skin [[lesion]]s indicative of poor health. He was then sold to [[Reino Aventura]] (now named [[Six Flags Mexico]]), an [[amusement park]] in Mexico City, in 1985. He was the star of the 1993 movie ''[[Free Willy]]'', the publicity from which led to an effort by [[Warner Bros.|Warner Brothers Studio]] to find him a better home. Using donations from the studio, [[Craig McCaw]] the [[Oregon Coast Aquarium]] in [[Newport, Oregon]] spent over $7 million to construct facilities to return him to health with the hope of returning him to the wild. He was airlifted to his new home in January 1996, where he soon regained weight. In September 1998, he was flown to Klettsvik Bay in [[Vestmannaeyjar]] in Iceland, and gradually reintroduced to the wild, returning to the open sea in July 11, 2002. Keiko died from pneumonia in December 12, 2003 at the age of 27 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.keiko.com/history.html |title=Keiko's Story: The Timeline |publisher=Keiko.com |date=December 12, 2003 |accessdate=April 29, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.keiko.com/ |title=The Free Willy Keiko Foundation |publisher=Keiko.com |date= |accessdate=April 29, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140517145357/http://keiko.com/ |archivedate=May 17, 2014 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; He had become lethargic and had a loss of appetite.

The practice of exhibiting killer whales born in captivity is less controversial than of retaining free-born orcas, since the captive-born orcas have known no other world and may not be able to adapt to life in the wild.

===Mundo Marino===
{{Main|Mundo Marino}}
Mundo Marino, located south of [[Buenos Aires]] in the coastal town of San Clemente del Tuyú, Argentina, is the largest aquarium in South America. Mundo Marino is home to one male killer whale, Kshamenk, that was stranded, or force-stranded, in 1992.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Humane Society|title=Held Captive: Orcas|url=http://www.humanesociety.org/issues/captive_marine/facts/captive_orcas.html|accessdate=July 25, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kshamenk is estimated to have been around 4 1/2 years old when captured.

===Tank size and water conditions===
Legal requirements for tank size vary greatly from country to country. In the US, the minimum enclosure size is set by the [[Code of Federal Regulations]], {{CodeFedReg |9|3|104}}, under the ''Specifications for the Humane Handling, Care, Treatment, and Transportation of Marine Mammals''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=c7a201bd3f7d31d5f8218167efcd49ba&amp;node=9:1.0.1.1.3.5.31.5&amp;rgn=div8 ''Title 9 CFR Part 3, Subpart E''] Retrieved March 10, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; In 9 CFR 3.104, Table III classifies killer whales as Group I [[cetacea]]ns with an average length of {{convert|24|ft}}. Based on length, Table I states up to two killer whales may be held in a pool with a minimum horizontal dimension (the diameter of a circular pool of water) of twice that length or {{convert|48|ft}} and a minimum depth of {{convert|12|ft}}, giving a minimum volume of {{convert|615|m3|ft3|order=flip}} for two killer whales. Each additional killer whale requires a pool with an additional {{convert|308|m3|ft3|order=flip}} of volume. 9 CFR 3.104 also requires a minimum of {{convert|63|m2|ft2|order=flip}} surface area per killer whale in Table IV (the example with a cylindrical tank {{convert|48|ft}} in diameter for two whales provides {{convert|905|ft2|m2}} of surface area per killer whale). [[Swiss]] regulations require a larger minimum volume: {{convert|400|m2}} × {{convert|4|m}} deep for two killer whales, or {{convert|1600|m3}}. The Alliance of Marine Mammal Parks and Aquariums (AMMPA) goes further, and recommends {{convert|1918|m3}} for two killer whales.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.waza.org/virtualzoo/factsheet.php?id=111-002-004-001&amp;view=Marine%20Mammals ''Killer whale''] World Association of Zoos and Aquariums.

The tanks in most marine parks are considerably larger than the minimum sizes required by regulations. However, the Miami Seaquarium  has been criticized for the small size of the tank holding their sole killer whale, Lolita, which is less than two of her body lengths wide at any point. Building a new tank would be costly and there is little prospect of replacing the aging Lolita.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.miaminewtimes.com/2008-08-21/news/seaquarium-activists-push-to-free-lolita-the-whale ''Seaquarium Activists Push to Free Lolita the Whale''] Village Voice Media.

===Nutrition and medical care===
On average, an adult killer whale in the wild may eat about three to four percent of their body weight daily,&lt;ref&gt;[http://library.thinkquest.org/TQ0311684/orcadietandlocation.html ''Orca diet and location''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090307063412/http://library.thinkquest.org/TQ0311684/orcadietandlocation.html |date=March 7, 2009 }} Oracle ThinkQuest.

To maintain their alertness, the killer whales are fed at sporadic intervals throughout the day (as would happen in the wild) and feeding is often combined with training and shows. Each batch of fish is carefully tested to determine its nutritive composition, and each killer whale's weight, activity and health is carefully monitored to determine any special dietary requirements.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.seaworld.org/ask-shamu/faq.htm#sw-animals ''Ask Shamu''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131003114525/http://www.seaworld.org/ask-shamu/faq.htm#sw-animals#sw-animals |date=October 3, 2013 }} SeaWorld.

===Training===
Whales are trained using a system of reward (called "[[positive reinforcement]]" by trainers) by giving the killer whale food or other reinforcement when they are successful, and withholding it when they are not.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/whales/debate/trainers.html |title=The Debate – Dangers To Trainers &amp;#124; A Whale Of A Business &amp;#124; FRONTLINE |publisher=PBS |date= |accessdate=April 29, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Secondary reinforcement—things not essential to life, such as play time, tactile rewards and fun games—can also be used as rewards.&lt;ref name=Resnick1994&gt;{{Cite book|last=Resnick|first=Jane|year=1994|title=All about training Shamu|isbn=1-884506-11-9|publisher=Third Story Books|location=Bridgeport, Conn.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Issues with captivity==
The practice of keeping killer whales in captivity is controversial, and organizations such as [[World Animal Protection]] and the [[Whale and Dolphin Conservation]] campaign against the captivity of killer whales. Orcas in captivity may develop physical pathologies, such as the [[dorsal fin]] collapse seen in 80–90% of captive males. {{cn|date=October 2018}}

The captive environment bears little resemblance to their wild habitat, and the social groups that the killer whales are put into are foreign to those found in the wild.&lt;ref name="Orcas in captivity"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wdcs.org/dan/publishing.nsf/allweb/A141A8A02A2FE3C7802568F60029D1F9 |title=Orcas in captivity |publisher=Whale and Dolphin Conservation Society |accessdate=July 25, 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070805220554/http://www.wdcs.org/dan/publishing.nsf/allweb/A141A8A02A2FE3C7802568F60029D1F9 |archivedate=August 5, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Critics claim that captive life is stressful due to small tanks, false social groupings and chemically altered water.

===Disease and lifespan===
The lifespan of killer whales in captivity versus wild killer whales is disputed.  Several studies published in scientific journals show that the average mortality rate for captive killer whales is approximately three times higher than in the wild.&lt;ref name="ECM2013"&gt;{{cite book|author=Parsons, ECM|title=An Introduction to Marine Mammal Biology and Conservation|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XbyxI-d5idcC&amp;pg=PA170|year=2013|publisher=Jones &amp; Bartlett Publishers|isbn=978-0-7637-8344-0|page=170}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2015 study in the ''[[Journal of Mammalogy]]'', authored by SeaWorld's vice-president of theriogenology, Todd Robeck,&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Robeck|first=Todd R.|last2=Willis|first2=Kevin|last3=Scarpuzzi|first3=Michael R.|last4=O’Brien|first4=Justine K.|date=2015-07-10|title=Comparisons of life-history parameters between free-ranging and captive killer whale (Orcinus orca) populations for application toward species management|url=http://jmammal.oxfordjournals.org/content/early/2015/07/09/jmammal.gyv113|journal=Journal of Mammalogy|language=en|pages=gyv113|doi=10.1093/jmammal/gyv113|issn=0022-2372|pmc=4668992|pmid=26937049|volume=96}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/seaworld-tilikum-orca-announcement-uses-misleading-statistics-on-life-expectancy_uk_56e2c472e4b096ed3adbcfc3|title=The Real Story Behind SeaWorld's 'Clearly Wrong' Statement On Its Dying Orca|website=The Huffington Post|language=en-GB|access-date=2016-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; concluded that the life expectancy for killer whales born at SeaWorld is the same as those in the wild.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Green|first1=Amy|title=Study Concludes Life Expectancy of SeaWorld Orcas Same As In The Wild|url=http://www.wmfe.org/study-concludes-life-expectancy-of-seaworld-orcas-same-as-in-the-wild/51238|accessdate=23 July 2015|agency=WMFE}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the wild, female killer whales have a typical lifespan of 60–80 years, and a maximum recorded lifespan of 103 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=World's oldest orca spotted near Vancouver Island|url=http://metronews.ca/news/victoria/1032108/worlds-oldest-orca-whale-spotted-near-vancouver-island/}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The average lifespan for males in the wild is 30 years, but some live up to 50–60 years.&lt;ref name=nmfssd&gt;{{cite web|title=Killer Whale (Orcinus Orca)|url=http://www.nmfs.noaa.gov/pr/species/mammals/cetaceans/killerwhale.htm#description|accessdate=September 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 2015 study has been criticised by Trevor Willis, senior lecturer in marine biology at the University of Portsmouth, who stated that the study is misleading, "clearly wrong" and indicative of "poor practice".

"There are no predators in a swimming pool. Second, and in the absence of any other information, it appears they’ve looked at the survival rate of calves in the first two years of life and extrapolated it out 50 years into the future."

The shallowness of orca tanks forces orcas to spend a lot of time at the surface. So much time at the surface leads to prolonged exposure to [[ultraviolet]] (UV) rays. Prolonged exposure to the surface and UV rays is attributed to sunburns and the development of cataracts in orcas in captivity. Orcas in the wild would live at higher latitudes, meaning less intense sun, and spend more time in deeper, darker waters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://theorcaproject.wordpress.com/2011/01/20/keto-tilikum-express-stress-of-orca-captivity/ |date=2011 |accessdate=October 6, 2015|title=Keto and Tilikum Express the Stress of Orca Captivity}}&lt;/ref&gt; While it is uncertain the effects of prolonged UV exposure to orcas' skin, since captive orca necropsies are extremely secretive,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hsi.org/assets/pdfs/orca_white_paper.pdf |date=2011 |accessdate=October 6, 2015|title=Killer Controversy: Why Orcas Should No Longer Be Kept in Captivity}}&lt;/ref&gt; it seems logical that prolonged exposure to UV rays on unprotected skin would have the same negative effects such as [[melanoma]] (skin cancer) on orcas as it does on humans.

===Dorsal fin collapse===
[[File:Orca collapsed dorsal fin.jpg|thumb|right|300px|This male ([[Tilikum (orca)|Tilikum]]), at [[SeaWorld Orlando]], had a collapsed dorsal fin.]]
Most captive male killer whales, and some females, have a [[dorsal fin]] that is partially or completely collapsed to one side. Several hypotheses exist as to why this happens. A dorsal fin is held erect by [[collagen]], which normally hardens in late adolescence.

Scientists from the [[National Marine Fisheries Service]] (NMFS) have reported that "the collapsed dorsal fins commonly seen in captive killer whales do not result from a pathogenic condition, but are instead thought to most likely originate from an irreversible structural change in the fin's collagen over time. Possible explanations for this include: (1) alterations in water balance caused by the stresses of captivity dietary changes, (2) lowered [[blood pressure]] due to reduced activity patterns, or (3) overheating of the collagen brought on by greater exposure of the fin to the ambient air."&lt;ref name=ConservationPlan/&gt; According to SeaWorld's website, another reason for the fin to bend may be the greater amount of time that captive whales spend at the surface, where the fin is not supported by water pressure.&lt;ref name=askshamu&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.seaworld.org/ask-shamu/faq.htm#sw-animals|title=Ask Shamu: Frequently Asked Questions|publisher=SeaWorld/Busch Gardens|accessdate=May 5, 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131003114525/http://www.seaworld.org/ask-shamu/faq.htm#sw-animals#sw-animals|archive-date=October 3, 2013|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Whale and Dolphin Conservation]] says that dorsal fin collapse is largely explained by captive killer whales swimming in small circles due to the inadequate space in which they have to swim.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wdcs.org/submissions_bin/orcareport.pdf|title=Captive Orcas 'Dying to Entertain You'|last=Williams|first=Vanessa|date=April 30, 2001|publisher=Whale and Dolphin Conservation Society|accessdate=May 5, 2008|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; SeaWorld, however, claims that "Neither the shape nor the droop of a whale's dorsal fin are indicators of a killer whale's health or well-being."&lt;ref name=askshamu/&gt;

Collapsed or collapsing dorsal fins are rare in most wild populations and usually result from a serious injury to the fin, such as from being shot or colliding with a vessel.&lt;ref name=ConservationPlan&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nwr.noaa.gov/Marine-Mammals/Whales-Dolphins-Porpoise/Killer-Whales/Conservation-Planning/upload/SRKW-propConsPlan.pdf |title=Proposed Conservation Plan for Southern Resident Killer Whales (Orcinus orca) |date=August 2005 |accessdate=May 7, 2007 |author=National Marine Fisheries Service Northwest Regional Office |format=PDF |work= |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070221111451/http://www.nwr.noaa.gov/Marine-Mammals/Whales-Dolphins-Porpoise/Killer-Whales/Conservation-Planning/upload/SRKW-propConsPlan.pdf |archivedate=February 21, 2007 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; After the 1989 [[Exxon Valdez oil spill|''Exxon Valdez'' oil spill]], the dorsal fins of two male resident killer whales who had been exposed to the oil collapsed, and the animals subsequently died.

Those living in a limited area, such as Puget Sound or the Strait of Juan de Fuca, are termed "resident" whales, while "transient" whales roam the oceans at will. These "transient" types have to be more aggressive, in order to assert themselves in a wide range of territories and to prey on a variety of different species. This increased aggressiveness does not disappear in captivity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.time.com/time/health/article/0,8599,1968249,00.html |title=Killer-Whale Tragedy: What Made Tilikum Snap? |date=February 26, 2010 |work=Time Magazine |publisher= |accessdate=March 5, 2010 | first=Jeffrey | last=Kluger}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, captivity itself has been asserted to aggravate aggressive behavior, resulting in a "cetacean equivalent of anxiety disorder."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cosmiclog.msnbc.msn.com/archive/2010/02/25/2212623.aspx |title=Inside the mind of a 'killer whale' |date=February 25, 2010 |work=Cosmic Log (website) |publisher=MSNBC |accessdate=March 9, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100301075958/http://cosmiclog.msnbc.msn.com/archive/2010/02/25/2212623.aspx |archivedate=March 1, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Captive killer whale attacks on humans seem to fall mostly into the categories of: biting during feeding, ramming in the water, and holding under water. Killer whales biting trainers during feeding or shows is generally the mildest form of attack seen, but can escalate to an animal dragging the trainer underwater and holding them there until they lose consciousness or drown. Trainers who have had killer whales ram into them in the water tend to suffer from a range of injuries including internal bleeding, broken bones, ruptured organs, and heart attack.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.keepwhaleswild.org/trainer-incidents.php |title=Keep Whales Wild: Trainer Incidents |accessdate=November 5, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On Christmas Eve of 2009, 29-year-old [[Death of Alexis Martínez|Alexis Martínez]] of Loro Parque, [[Tenerife]], Spain was killed by a whale named Keto. After spending two and a half minutes at the bottom of the 12-meter-deep main pool, his body was retrieved but he could not be revived. The park initially characterized the death as an "accident" and claimed that the body showed no signs of violence, but the subsequent autopsy report stated that Martinez died due to grave injuries sustained by an orca attack, including multiple compression fractures, tears to vital organs, and the bite marks of the animal on his body.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=M.

===Aggression between captive orcas===
One infamous incident of killer whale aggression took place in August 1989, when the dominant female Icelandic killer whale at SeaWorld San Diego, [[Kandu V]], attempted to "rake" a female newcomer named [[Corky (killer whale)|Corky]]. Raking is a way orcas show dominance by forcefully scratching at another with their teeth. Kandu charged at Corky, attempting to rake her, missed and continued swimming into the back pool, where she ended up ramming the wall, rupturing an artery in her jaw. The crowd was quickly ushered out of the stadium. Forty-five minutes later Kandu V sank to the bottom of the pool and died.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.orca-zone.com/aboutorcas/corkysstory.html "Corky's Story"] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120910135912/http://www.orca-zone.com/aboutorcas/corkysstory.html |date=September 10, 2012 }} The Orca Zone.

[[Kanduke]], a male captured from T pod in British Columbia, Canada in August 1975, often fought with a younger Icelandic male named Kotar. The aggression became increasingly serious, leading to an incident in which Kotar bit a part of Kanduke's genitals and caused an infection. It is not known if such serious aggression and injury would occur in the open seas.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20091025114033/http://geocities.com/orca2000uk/Kanduke.html  "Kanduke"] Orca Spirit.

===Early pregnancy and related issues===
Captive killer whales often give birth at a much younger age than in the wild, sometimes as young as age seven. The young mothers may have difficulty raising their offspring. The calves have a relatively low survival rate, though some have lived into adulthood.

[[Corky (killer whale)|Corky (II)]], a female from the [[A5 Pod]] in [[British Columbia]], [[Canada]] became the first killer whale to become pregnant in captivity, giving birth on February 28, 1977. The calf died after 18 days. Corky went on to give birth six more times, but the longest surviving calf, Kiva, lived only 47 days.&lt;ref&gt;[http://orcalab.org/2008/12/08/corkys-saddest-day-december-11th-2008/ "Corky's saddest day"] Orca Lab.

A killer whale named [[Katina (whale)|Katina]], captured near Iceland at about three years of age in October 1978, became pregnant in early spring of 1984 at SeaWorld San Diego and gave birth in September 1985 to a female named [[Kalina (whale)|Kalina]]. Although ten years was an extremely young age for a killer whale to become a mother, Kalina was the first killer whale calf to be successfully born and raised in captivity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wdcs.org/submissions_bin/orcareport.pdf "Captive Orcas 'Dying to Entertain You'"] Whale and Dolphin Conservation Society.

[[Gudrun (whale)|Gudrun]] was an Icelandic female caught in the 1970s. In 1993, she gave birth to Nyar, a female who was both mentally and physically ill, and who Gudrun tried to drown during several shows. Nyar died from an illness a few months later. Gudrun died in 1996 from stillbirth complications.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http://www.geocities.com/orca2000uk/Gudrun.html&amp;date=2009-10-26+00:03:05  "Gudrun"] GeoCities.

[[Taima (whale)|Taima]] is a transient/Icelandic hybrid female killer whale born in captivity to Gudrun in 1989.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.seaworld.org/whats-new/znn/2007/march/seaworld-welcomes-newest.htm  SeaWorld Welcomes Newest "Pea" to Pod], press release, SeaWorld Orlando, March 12, 2007.

In May 1998, Taima gave birth to a male calf named Sumar. They were separated when he was about eight months old because of the aggression between them. On one occasion while performing, Taima started biting Sumar and throwing him out of the pool onto the [[animal trainer|trainer]]'s platform. She then slid out herself, and continued to bite him. In November 2000, Taima gave birth to a male named Tekoa. The two were separated after only nine months due to aggression between them.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.freewebs.com/beyondtheblue/taima.htm "Beyond the Blue: Taima"] Free Webs.

Taima seemed to be a better mother this time, and no notable occurrences of aggression were reported; this may be in part due to the fact that Kalina acted as "aunt" to Malia and helped Taima to look after her. Kalina was a very experienced mother and would often be kept with Malia, while Taima was given time with her mate, Tilikum.
Taima died in 2010 during the birthing process of her fourth calf.  The calf, fathered by Tilikum, was stillborn.

[[Kayla (whale)|Kayla]], a killer whale born in captivity, gave birth to her first calf on October 9, 2005, a female named Halyn. Kayla rejected her calf, perhaps because she had never been exposed to a young calf before and did not know how to deal with it. Halyn was moved to a special animal care facility to be hand raised. Halyn died unexpectedly on June 15, 2008.&lt;ref name="WOAI"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.woai.com/news/local/story.aspx?content_id=F016E77F-495E-4F8D-80D0-C067CAF7B562&amp;gsa=true= |title=Killer whale at SeaWorld San Antonio dies |accessdate=June 15, 2008 |date= |work= |publisher=[[Dallas Morning News]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090308112825/http://www.woai.com/news/local/story.aspx?content_id=F016E77F-495E-4F8D-80D0-C067CAF7B562&amp;gsa=true%3D |archivedate=March 8, 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 13, 2010, Kohana, an eight-year-old female killer whale, gave birth to a male calf at Loro Parque's "Orca Ocean" exhibit after a four-hour labor. The calf weighed about 150 kilograms (330&amp;nbsp;lb), and was two meters (6&amp;nbsp;ft 7 in) long. Kohana has yet to establish a "maternal bond" with her calf, forcing trainers to take the first steps in hand rearing him. The outcome of this pregnancy was not considered surprising, since Kohana was separated from her own mother, Takara, at three years of age, and was never able to learn about maternal care, compounded by the fact that she spent the formative years of her life surrounded by the three other juvenile killer whales at Loro Parque.

'''Commonwealth Oil Refineries''' (COR) was an [[Australia]]n oil company that operated between 1920 and 1952 as a joint venture of the Australian government and the [[Anglo-Persian Oil Company]].

==Early history==

In 1924 it opened Australia's first oil refinery near [[Laverton, Victoria]], north of the [[Port Fairy railway line|Melbourne - Geelong railway]], adjacent to Kororoit Creek Road.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A History of Altona and Laverton: Industrial Development|url=http://www.alhs.com.au/altona-laverton-history/a-history-of-altona/industrial-development.html|publisher=Altona and Laverton Historical Society|accessdate=2013-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | author1=Commonwealth Oil Refineries (Australia) | title=The romance of the C.O.R. : a great national institution | publication-date=1938 | publisher=C.O.R | url=http://trove.nla.gov.au/work/18541936 | accessdate=20 June 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The refinery received its first shipment of crude oil on 12 March 1924, with product coming "on-stream" on 17 May 1924. The refinery had an annual processing capacity of 100,000 tons of crude oil. The refinery was shut down on 6 August 1955, eclipsed by much larger refineries being built around the country.

In the 1930s the company was involved in oil search ventures.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | author1=Amos, D. J.

==BP==
In 1952, the [[Robert Menzies|Menzies]] [[Coalition (Australia)|Coalition]] government sold the Australian government's interest in COR to the [[Anglo-Iranian Oil Company]], which became the [[British Petroleum|British Petroleum Company]] (BP) in 1954.

The '''Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act of 1970''', {{USStatute|91|513|84|1236|1970|10|27}}, is a [[United States federal law]] that, with subsequent modifications, requires the [[pharmaceutical industry]] to maintain physical security and strict record keeping for certain types of [[drugs]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Electronic prescribing of controlled substances [electronic resource]: addressing health care and law enforcement priorities: hearing before the Committee on the Judiciary, United States Senate, One Hundred Tenth Congress, first session, December 4, 2007.|publisher=United States Senate Committee on the Judiciary |year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Controlled substances]] are divided into five schedules (or classes) on the basis of their potential for abuse, accepted medical use, and accepted safety under medical supervision. Substances in Schedule I have a high potential for abuse, no accredited medical use, and a lack of accepted safety. From Schedules II to V, substances decrease in potential for abuse. The schedule a substance is placed in determines how it must be controlled. Prescriptions for drugs in all schedules must bear the physician's federal Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) license number, but some drugs in Schedule V do not require a prescription. State schedules may vary from federal schedules.

The [[Controlled Substances Act]] (CSA), Title II of the Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act of 1970, is the legal foundation of the government's fight against the abuse of [[recreational drug use|drugs]] and other substances. This law is a consolidation of numerous laws regulating the manufacture and distribution of [[narcotic]]s, [[stimulant]]s, [[depressant]]s, [[hallucinogen]]s, [[anabolic steroid]]s, and chemicals used in the illicit production of controlled substances. The act also provides a mechanism for substances to be controlled, added to a schedule, decontrolled, removed from control, rescheduled, or transferred from one schedule to another.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Recognizing Signs of Prescription Drug Abuse and Addiction, Part I |last=Felicilda-Reynaldo, |first=Rhea Faye D |journal=Medsurg Nursing |volume=23 |issue=6 |pages=391–96 |year=November–December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Proceedings to add, delete, or change the schedule of a drug or other substance may be initiated by the [[Drug Enforcement Administration]] (DEA), the [[Department of Health and Human Services]] (HHS), or by petition from any interested party, including the manufacturer of a drug, a medical society or association, a pharmacy association, a public interest group concerned with drug abuse, a state or local government agency, or an individual citizen. When a petition is received by the DEA, the agency begins its own investigation of the drug.

The DEA also may begin an investigation of a drug at any time based upon information received from law enforcement laboratories, state and local law enforcement and regulatory agencies, or other sources of information.

Once the DEA has collected the necessary data, the Administrator of the Drug Enforcement Association, by authority of the [[United States Attorney General|Attorney General]], requests from the HHS a scientific and medical evaluation and recommendation as to whether the drug or other substance should be controlled or removed from control. This request is sent to the Assistant Secretary of Health of the HHS. Then, the HHS solicits information from the Commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration and evaluations and recommendations from the [[National Institute on Drug Abuse]], and on occasion, from the scientific and medical community. The Assistant Secretary, by authority of the Secretary, compiles the information and transmits back to the DEA a medical and scientific evaluation regarding the drug or other substance, a recommendation as to whether the drug should be controlled, and in what schedule it should be placed.

The medical and scientific evaluations are binding to the DEA with respect to scientific and medical matters. The recommendation on scheduling is binding only to the extent that if HHS recommends that the substance not be controlled, the DEA may not control the substance.

Once the DEA has received the scientific and medical evaluation from HHS, the Administrator will evaluate all available data and make a final decision whether to propose that a drug or other substance be controlled and into which schedule it should be placed.

The CSA also creates a closed system of distribution for those authorized to handle controlled substances. The cornerstone of this system is the registration of all those authorized by the DEA to handle controlled substances. All individuals and firms that are registered are required to maintain complete and accurate inventories and records of all transactions involving [[controlled substances]], as well as security for the storage of controlled substances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Real Property, Trust, and Estate Law: Rents, Refi's, and Reefer Madness|last=Painter|first=J.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="971">The '''Convention on the Regulation of Antarctic Mineral Resource Activities''' is a treaty that is part of the [[Antarctic Treaty System]]. The convention was concluded at [[Wellington]] on 2 June 1988. The government of New Zealand is the depository of the treaty.

The convention was signed by 19 states, but no states have ratified it. Therefore, the convention has not entered into force and has been replaced by the 1998 [[Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty]] (Madrid Protocol).

[[File:Informe-Diego-Barros-Arana.1890.jpg|200px|thumb|Report of the Chilean Expert on marking the frontier line [[Diego Barros Arana]] to his government showing the different interpretation of the 1881's treaty in Chile and Argentina]]
'''The Cordillera of the Andes Boundary Case''' ({{lang-es|Laudo limítrofe entre Argentina y Chile de 1902}}) was a British arbitration in 1902 that established the present day boundaries between [[Argentina]] and [[Chile]]. In northern and central [[Patagonia]], the borders were established between the latitudes of 40° and 52° S as an interpretation of the [[Boundary treaty of 1881 between Chile and Argentina]]. 

As result of the arbitration, some Patagonian lakes, such as [[O'Higgins/San Martín Lake]], became divided by a national boundary. Additionally the preferences of settled colonists in a cultivated part of the area in dispute had been canvassed. The boundary proposed in the arbitration was a compromise between the boundary preferences of the two disputing governments, which neither strictly followed the alignment of highest peaks nor the fluvial watershed, and was published in the name of King [[Edward VII]].

==Background==
*[[Pactos de Mayo]]
*[[Boundary treaty of 1881 between Chile and Argentina]]
*[[Uti possidetis]]
*[[Drainage divide|Divortium aquorum]]

==Preparations and geographic surveys==
*[[Francisco Perito Moreno]]
*[[Hans Steffen]]

==British arbitration==

The escalation in tension between Chile and Argentina suggested armed conflict had become a distinct probability towards the end of the 19th Century as both had [[Argentina Chile relations#Claims on Patagonia|claims on Patagonia]].  The Argentinian [[Pablo Riccheri|Riccheri]] Law continued to provide for selective national service; the expansion of the Argentine armed forces after the campaigns and subjugation of the Pampas and expanded southwards and westwards into Patagonia in the "[[Conquest of the Desert]]".  Argentina and Chile had successfully reached a measure of mutual agreement in the [[Boundary treaty of 1881 between Chile and Argentina|Boundary Treaty of 1881]] and subsequently identified other boundary alignment issues to be resolved by binding arbitration under the [[Pactos de Mayo|1902 "May Pact"]]  and sought the involvement of the UK as mediator.

Commissioners [[Francisco Moreno]] (Argentina), [[Diego Barros Arana]] (Chile) and [[Thomas Holdich|Sir Thomas Holdich]] (UK) visited the Andean Patagonian valleys to make site-based observations following the written submissions presented previously by the two parties to the Arbitration Panel.

Since 1885, this [[Welsh Patagonia#Expansion towards the Andes 1885.E2.80.931902|valley]] had been settled by many Welsh emigrants.  This fertile east-west aligned valley was initially awarded to Chile. Subsequently the commissioners visited Trevelin and received the views of the inhabitants of the "Colonia del Valle 16 de Octubre" on 30 April 1902, for three days, in School Number 18, which had been founded in 1895 next to the river Corintios by the Argentine National Government.  The arbitration award finally adjudicated in favour of the Republic of Argentina, and Trevelin, Esquel and other adjacent settlements were subsequently incorporated into Chubut province.

Research by Gustavo De Vera and Jorge Fiori starting in 1998 was published as the "Winds of War" in 2002 to coincide with the centenary, for the Directorate of Culture, Trevelin, has investigated the background and events around the "1902 Referendum".  They have concluded that the views of the inhabitants, whilst not the sole determinate, were certainly influential in founding an acceptable alignment for the national boundary in this part of Patagonia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=1902 Referendum: historical research book|url=http://www.patagonia.com.ar/Esquel/53E_1902+Referendum%3A+historical+research+book.html|publisher=Patagonia.com.ar|accessdate=9 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Boundary==
In some areas such as [[Aysén Region]], the Chilean claims were partly agreed, giving Chile foothold on the lakes and plains east of the Andes, while in some other areas the Argentine thesis of the ''Snowy Cordillera'' prevailed as the boundary.

==Subsequent Disputes==
In the area of the ''Campo de Hielo Sur'', the large, ice-covered area in the Patagonian Andes, the border discussions have continued after 1902. (See [[:es:Litigio del campo de hielo Patagónico Sur]].)

{{Politics of the European Union}}
'''Council Implementing Regulation (EU) No. 282/2011''' was adopted by the [[Council of the European Union]] on 15 March 2011. This was mainly because the terms and wording of Directive 2006/112/EC (hereinafter "[[VAT]] Directive") have been inconclusive in some cases. The Regulation provided new implementing measures for the VAT Directive. Especially due to the amendment of the VAT Directive itself and the consistent case-law of the [[European Court of Justice]], the former Implementing Regulation (EC) No. 1777/2005 had to be recast and clarified in certain aspects. This Implementing Regulation became effective on 1 July 2011 and does not have to be transported into national legislation of the individual [[member states of the European Union]] (unlike a directive) and thus is directly applicable.

===Directives===

A [[Directive (European Union)|directive]] is a binding act of general application as a legal instrument of the [[Institutions of the European Union|European institutions]] addressed to the Member States to implement their policies, cf. Article 288 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union ([http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:C:2010:083:0047:0200:en:PDF TFEU]). To apply direct effect in national law the directive has to be transposed by the Member States.&lt;ref&gt;Communication department of the European Commission.

==Legal basis==

The statutory basis of '''Implementing Regulations''' is set out in Articles 164 and 178 of the TFEU, regarding the Implementing Regulations of the [[European Social Fund]] and the [[European Regional Development Fund]]s.
The validity of Implementing Regulations as legal acts depends on the "basic Regulations". The latter lay down the fundamental rules, while the implementing regulations set out the technical provisions.&lt;ref&gt;Communication department of the European Commission. ''The decision-making process and the work of the institutions''. Retrieved 25 July 2011, from http://europa.eu/legislation_summaries/institutional_affairs/decisionmaking_process/l14522_en.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structure==

The structure of Regulation (EU) No. 282/2011 follows the structure of the VAT Directive and affects almost all areas:

&lt;small&gt;1. &lt;u&gt;'''Recitals (No. 1-46)'''&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/small&gt;

&lt;small&gt;2. &lt;u&gt;'''Chapters (Ch. I-XII)'''&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/small&gt;

{|
|-
| &lt;small&gt;''Chapter I'' Subjekt matter (Art. 1)&lt;/small&gt; || &lt;small&gt;''Chapter VII'' Rates (Art. 43)&lt;/small&gt;
|-
| &lt;small&gt;''Chapter II'' Scope (Art. 2-4)&lt;/small&gt; || &lt;small&gt;''Chapter VIII'' Exemptions (Art. 44-51)&lt;/small&gt;
|-
| &lt;small&gt;''Chapter III'' Taxable persons (Art. 5)&lt;/small&gt; || &lt;small&gt;''Chapter IX'' Deductions (Art. 52)&lt;/small&gt;
|-
| &lt;small&gt;''Chapter IV'' Taxable transactions (Art. 6-9)&lt;/small&gt; || &lt;small&gt;''Chapter X'' Obligations of taxable persons (Art. 53-55)&lt;/small&gt;

|-
| &lt;small&gt;''Chapter VI'' Taxable amount (Art. 42)&lt;/small&gt; || &lt;small&gt;''Chapter XII'' Final provisions (Art. 64-65)&lt;/small&gt;
|}

&lt;small&gt;3. &lt;u&gt;'''Appendix (App. I-IV)'''&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/small&gt;
----

==Aim and subject==

As mentioned in recital No. 1 of the Regulation a number of substantial changes are to be made to Council Regulation (EC) No. 1777/2005 of 17 October 2005 laying down implementing measures for Directive 77/388/EEC on the common system of value added tax. It is desirable, for reasons of clarity and rationalization, that the provisions in question should be recast.
One of the main reasons for the need of amendment, referring to recital No. 3 of the Regulation, is the transpose of changes resulting from the adoption of Council Directive 2008/8/EC of 12 February 2008 amending Directive 2006/112/EC as regards the place of supply of services. Additionally the adoption of the Commission Regulation (EC) No. 520/2009 – covering changes to the place of supply and service – requires the mentioned modification.
The objective is to ensure uniform application of the current VAT system by laying down rules implementing Directive 2006/112/EC, in particular in respect of taxable persons, the supply of goods and services, and the place of taxable transactions (cf. recital No. 4 Reg.).

==Scope of application==

In accordance with Article 5 subparagraph 4 of the [[Treaty of European Union]] ([http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:C:2006:321E:0001:0331:EN:PDF TEU]) this Regulation does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve the abovementioned objective (principle of proportionality; cf. recital No. 4 Reg.).  
Referring to recital No. 5 of the Regulation these implementing provisions contain specific rules in response to selective questions of application and are designed to bring uniform treatment throughout the Union to those specific circumstances only. They are therefore not conclusive for other cases and, in view of their formulation, are to be applied restrictively.

==Major subjects and most relevant changes==

===Definition of the scope of restaurant and catering services (Art. 6 Reg.)===

Art. 6 of the Regulation contains that restaurant and catering services are deemed to be services consisting of the supply of prepared or unprepared food or beverages, for human consumption, accompanied by sufficient support services allowing for the immediate consumption thereof. If no such accompanying support services are provided, the supply shall not be considered a supply of services in the form of restaurant and catering services [http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:C:2011:130:0006:0006:EN:PDF (cf. European Court of Justice C-497/09 "C-Bog", C-499/09 "CinemaxX", C-501/09 "Lohmeyer", C 502/09 "Fleischerei Nier")].&lt;ref&gt;Martin Schmitz. VAT Newsletter. ''EU issues binding implementing regulation on the VAT Directive''. KPMG AG, 2011, p.6. Retrieved 25 July 2011 from http://www.kpmg.de/docs/vat_newsletter_2011_05_engl.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Using an example that means the supply of a soda can through a drinks dispenser is not a restaurant and catering service within the meaning of Art. 6 of the Regulation.

===Concepts of the place of business and fixed establishment (Art. 10-13 Reg.)===

The definition of the "place where the business of a taxable person is established" deserves special attention, which is stated as the "place where the functions of the business's central administration are carried out" (cf. Art. 10 Reg.).
This clarifies that the focus should not be on the day-to-day operations.&lt;ref&gt;PwC AG. ''Neue Durchführungsverordnung zur Mehrwertsteuer-Systemrichtlinie''. PwC AG, 2011. Retrieved 25 July 2011 from http://tax-news.pwc.de/steuern-und-recht/2011/06/neue-durchf%C3%BChrungsverordnung-zur-mehrwertsteuersystemrichtlinie.html&lt;/ref&gt; To specify the place of business, account must be taken of the place where:
:* essential decisions are taken on the general management of the business
:* the registered office of the business is located and
:* management meets.
Where these criteria do not allow the place of establishment of a business to be determined with certainty, the place where essential decisions concerning the general management of the business are taken shall take precedence (cf. Art 10 Nr. 2 Reg.).
Mere presence of a postal address may not be taken to be the place of establishment of a business of a taxable person (cf. Art. 10 No. 3 Reg.).

The term "fixed establishment" is characterized in Art. 11 of the Regulation by a "sufficient degree of permanence and a suitable structure" relating to "human and technical resources to enable it to provide the service which it supplies". Thus it is not required that the branch provides services by itself. Merely it needs to have the ability to receive and use such. Even if the services are only provided for the head office the conditions are met.&lt;ref&gt;PwC AG. ''Neue Durchführungsverordnung zur Mehrwertsteuer-Systemrichtlinie''. PwC AG, 2011. Retrieved 25 July 2011 from http://tax-news.pwc.de/steuern-und-recht/2011/06/neue-durchf%C3%BChrungsverordnung-zur-mehrwertsteuersystemrichtlinie.html&lt;/ref&gt;  Nevertheless, where the resources of the fixed establishment are only used for administrative support they will not be regarded as being used for the supply of goods or services. Having a VAT number does not equal having a fixed establishment (cf. Art. 11 No. 3 Reg.).&lt;ref&gt;PwC Bulgaria. ''VAT Regulation 282/2011''. PwC LLP, 2011. Retrieved 25 July 2011 from http://www.amcham.bg/Libraries/AmCham%20Events/VAT%20Regulation%20282%20workshop%20July%202011%20EN%20Ver.sflb&lt;/ref&gt;

These provisions are important for purposes of determining the place of supply of a Business-to-Business transaction pursuant to Art. 44 of the VAT Directive.&lt;ref&gt;Martin Schmitz. VAT Newsletter. ''EU issues binding implementing regulation on the VAT Directive''. KPMG AG, 2011, p.6. Retrieved 25 July 2011 from http://www.kpmg.de/docs/vat_newsletter_2011_05_engl.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

===Concepts of status, capacity and location of the customer (Art. 17-25 Reg.)===

The correct application of the rules based on the place of supply of services relies mainly on the status of the customer as a taxable person or non-taxable person, and on the capacity in which he is acting.&lt;ref&gt;Deloitte Hungary. Tax Allert ''Preparing for the new implementing Regulation of the VAT Directive''. Deloitte Global Service Limited, 30 March 2011. Retrieved 25 July 2011 from http://www.deloitte.com/assets/Dcom-Hungary/Local%20Assets/Documents/Newsletters/Tax%20Alert%20_English/FY%202011/Preparing%20for%20the%20new%20implementing%20Regulation%20of%20the%20VAT%20Directive_20110323.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

====EU established customer====
As mentioned in Art. 18 No. 1a of the Regulation a customer can be assumed as being a taxable person if the customer has communicated his VAT number and the supplier obtains confirmation of the validity of that identification number. The validity can be checked at the [http://ec.europa.eu/taxation_customs/vies/ web site] of the European Commission.
Where the customer has not received a VAT number yet (Art. 18 No. 1b Reg.) the supplier shall obtain any other proof which demonstrates that the customer is a taxable person; and the supplier carries out a reasonable level of verification of the accuracy of the information.
In accordance with Art. 18 No. 2 of the Regulation the customer is a non-taxable person if no identification number is provided.

====Customer established outside EU====
According to Art. 18 Nr. 3a of the Regulation the customer can be regarded as a taxable person if he provides to the supplier a certificate issued by the competent tax authorities that the customer is engaged in economic activities in order to enable him to obtain a refund of VAT. If no such document is available the customer should provide to the supplier:
:* VAT number or similar number; or
:* any other proof that the customer is a taxable person, and
:* the supplier carries out a reasonable level of verification of the accuracy of the information provided by the customer (cf. Art. 18 Nr. 3b Reg.).
The improvement of those provisions for the suppliers is to reduce the VAT risk and strengthen the cases where the supplier acts in good faith.&lt;ref&gt;Deloitte Hungary. Tax Allert ''Preparing for the new implementing Regulation of the VAT Directive''. Deloitte Global Service Limited, 30 March 2011. Retrieved 25 July 2011 from http://www.deloitte.com/assets/Dcom-Hungary/Local%20Assets/Documents/Newsletters/Tax%20Alert%20_English/FY%202011/Preparing%20for%20the%20new%20implementing%20Regulation%20of%20the%20VAT%20Directive_20110323.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

====Capacity of the customer====
For the purpose of determining the place of supply in accordance with Art. 44 (Business-to-Business transactions) and Art. 45 (Business-to-Consumer transactions) of the VAT Directive, Art 19 of the Regulation clarifies that taxable persons or legal persons deemed to be taxable persons who receive services exclusively for private use, including by their staff, shall be regarded as non taxable persons.

===Definition of the concept of admission to cultural events (Art. 32-33 Reg.)===

Art. 32 and Art. 33 of the Regulation define the right of admission within the meaning of Art. 53 of the VAT Directive to cultural and similar events and services. The Regulation distinguishes between services in respect of admission to events (cf. Art. 32 Reg.) and the ancillary services (cf. Art. 33 Reg.). 
Art. 32 of the Regulation shall be applicable for the therein specified services except the use of facilities such as gymnastics halls and suchlike, in exchange for the payment of a fee (cf. Art. 32 No. 3 Reg.).
Art. 33 of the Regulation includes services which are directly related to admission to events and includes in particular the use of sanitary facilities but shall not include mere intermediary services relating to the sale of tickets.

==Advantages and disadvantages==

* The Regulation provides more clarity concerning special concepts of the VAT Directive, which was necessary in respect to a uniform application within the European Union.&lt;ref&gt;PwC AG. ''Neue Durchführungsverordnung zur Mehrwertsteuer-Systemrichtlinie''. PwC AG, 2011. Retrieved 25 July 2011 from http://tax-news.pwc.de/steuern-und-recht/2011/06/neue-durchf%C3%BChrungsverordnung-zur-mehrwertsteuersystemrichtlinie.html&lt;/ref&gt;
* The Implementing Regulation is a sign for the inexactitude of the legislator when drafting the VAT Directive. The resulting inadequacies are indented to be corrected by the presented Regulation.&lt;ref&gt;PwC AG. ''Neue Durchführungsverordnung zur Mehrwertsteuer-Systemrichtlinie''. PwC AG, 2011.

* Furthermore, the Implementing Regulation – being an equal regulation in comparison to the VAT Directive – will not lead to a better transparency or overview. In most cases it would have been wiser to transform the VAT Directive itself in respect to the necessary changes.&lt;ref&gt;PwC AG. ''Neue Durchführungsverordnung zur Mehrwertsteuer-Systemrichtlinie''. PwC AG, 2011.

The U.S. [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) is an agency of the [[United States Department of Health and Human Services]] and is responsible for the safety regulation of most types of [[food]]s, [[dietary supplement]]s, [[Medication|drugs]], [[vaccine]]s, [[Biopharmaceutical|biological medical products]], [[blood transfusion|blood products]], [[medical device]]s, [[Electromagnetic radiation|radiation]]-emitting devices, veterinary products, and [[cosmetics]].

The economist [[Milton Friedman]] has claimed that the regulatory process is inherently biased against approval of some worthy drugs, because the adverse effects of wrongfully banning a useful drug are undetectable, while the consequences of mistakenly approving a harmful drug are highly publicised and that therefore the FDA will take the action that will result in the least public condemnation of the FDA regardless of the health consequences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Carpenter DP | title=The political economy of FDA drug review: processing, politics, and lessons for policy | journal= [[Health Affairs]] | volume=23 | issue=1 | year=2004 | pages=53–63 | url=http://content.healthaffairs.org/content/23/1/52.long | id= | pmid=15002628 | doi=10.1377/hlthaff.23.1.52}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=[[Milton Friedman]]| author2 = [[Rose Friedman]] | year = 1990 |origyear=1980 | title = Free to Choose | chapter = Chapter 7 -- Who Protects the Consumer? | edition = First Harvest | publisher = [[Harvest House]] | pages = 203–210 | isbn = 978-0-15-633460-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Concerns about the length of the drug approval process were brought to the fore early in the [[AIDS epidemic]]. In the late 1980s, [[ACT-UP]] and other [[HIV]] activist organizations accused the FDA of unnecessarily delaying the approval of medications to fight HIV and [[opportunistic infection]]s, and staged large protests, such as a confrontational October 11, 1988 action at the FDA campus which resulted in nearly 180 arrests.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.actupny.org/documents/cron-88.html ACT-UP NY timeline].&lt;/ref&gt; In August 1990, [[Louis Lasagna]], then chairman of a presidential advisory panel on drug approval, estimated that thousands of lives were lost each year due to delays in approval and marketing of drugs for [[cancer]] and [[AIDS]].&lt;ref&gt;Faster Approval of AIDS Drugs Is Urged.

===Allegations that FDA regulation causes higher drug prices===
Studies published in 2003 by Joseph DiMasi and colleagues estimated an average cost of approximately $800 million to bring a new drug to market,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=DiMasi J |title=The value of improving the productivity of the drug development process: faster times and better decisions |journal=PharmacoEconomics |volume=20 Suppl 3 |issue= |pages=1–10 |year= 2002|pmid=12457421 |doi=10.2165/00019053-200220003-00001}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=DiMasi J, Hansen R, Grabowski H |title=The price of innovation: new estimates of drug development costs |journal=J Health Econ |volume=22 |issue=2 |pages=151–85 |year=2003 |pmid=12606142 |doi=10.1016/S0167-6296(02)00126-1|last2=Hansen |last3=Grabowski }}.&lt;/ref&gt; while a 2006 study estimated the cost to be anywhere from $500 million to $2 billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Adams C, Brantner V |title=Estimating the cost of new drug development: is it really 802 million dollars? |journal=Health Aff (Millwood) |volume=25 |issue=2 |pages=420–8 |year= 2006|pmid=16522582 |doi=10.1377/hlthaff.25.2.420|last2=Brantner }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[consumer advocacy]] group [[Public Citizen]], using a different methodology, estimated the average cost for development to be under $200 million, about 29% of which is spent on FDA-required [[clinical trial]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.citizen.org/documents/rdmyths.pdf 2001 Public Citizen Report on Drug Development Costs].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.citizen.org/congress/reform/drug_industry/articles.cfm?ID=6532 Public Citizen response to 2003 DiMasi papers].&lt;/ref&gt; DiMasi rejects the claim that high R&amp;D costs alone are responsible for high drug prices. Instead, in a published letter, DiMasi writes, "...longer development times increase R&amp;D costs and shorten the period during which drug companies can earn the returns they need to make investment financially viable. Other things being equal, longer development times reduce innovation incentives. As a consequence, fewer new therapies might be developed."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=DiMasi JA |title=What's time got to do with it? |journal=Health Aff (Millwood) |date=Jul–August 2006 |volume=25 |issue=4 |pmid=16835212 |pages=1188 |doi=10.1377/hlthaff.25.4.1188}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Nobel prize]]-winning economist [[Gary S. Becker]] has argued that FDA-required clinical trials for new drugs do contribute to high drug prices for consumers, mainly because of patent protection that provides a temporary monopoly which disallows cheaper alternatives from entering the market. He advocates dropping many FDA requirements, many of which provide no additional safety or valuable information, as this would hasten the development of new drugs, because they would be faster to bring to market, thereby increasing supply, and as a consequence would lead to lower prices.&lt;ref&gt;Becker, Gary.

===Allegations of censorship in food and drug labeling===
The FDA has been criticized by advocates for the supplement industry for prohibiting [[dietary supplement]] manufacturers from making research supported claims of effectiveness on the labels of their products. Manufacturers of supplements, which are considered foods for regulatory purposes, are allowed to make only limited "[[structure/function claims]]" and are prohibited from claiming that the supplement can prevent, cure, or mitigate a disease or condition regardless of whether or not the supplement undergoes actual testing of its safety and efficacy. [[Ron Paul]] ([[Republican Party (United States)|R]]-[[Texas|TX]]) opined: "But the FDA and the drug companies are in bed together and they squeeze out competitions and build up their monopolies and they love government medicine because they make more money."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.dailypaul.com/225780/ron-paul-fda-and-big-pharma-are-in-bed-together | title=Ron Paul: FDA And Big Pharma 'Are In Bed Together' | publisher=Dailypaul.com | date=April 10, 2012 | accessdate=18 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ron Paul also introduced a bill on November 10, 2005 titled the "Health Freedom Protection Act" (H.R. 4282),&lt;ref&gt;[http://archive.lewrockwell.com/paul/paul288.html] "Free Speech and Dietary Supplements" by Representative Ron Paul, Before the US House of Representatives, November 10, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/109/hr4282] Health Freedom Protection Act&lt;/ref&gt; which proposed to stop "the FDA from censoring truthful claims about the curative, mitigative, or preventative effects of dietary supplements, and adopts the federal court’s suggested use of disclaimers as an alternative to censorship."&lt;ref&gt;http://archive.lewrockwell.com/paul/paul288.html "Free Speech and Dietary Supplements"&lt;/ref&gt;

==Charges of under-regulation==
In addition to those who see the FDA as a source of excessive regulation, other critics believe that the FDA does not regulate some products strictly enough. According to this view, the FDA allows unsafe drugs on the market because of pressure from pharmaceutical companies, fails to ensure safety in drug storage and labelling, and allows the use of dangerous agricultural chemicals, food additives, and food processing techniques.

A $1.8 million 2006 [[Institute of Medicine]] report on pharmaceutical regulation in the U.S. found major deficiencies in the current FDA system for ensuring the safety of drugs on the American market. Overall, the authors called for an increase in the [[regulations|regulatory powers]], funding, and independence of the FDA.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite news |first=Diedtra |last=Henderson |title=Panel: FDA needs more power, funds |work= Boston Globe |date=September 23, 2006}} [https://www.webcitation.org/5NkCrjdpd?url=http://www.boston.com/business/healthcare/articles/2006/09/23/panel_fda_needs_more_power_funds/]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.nap.edu/execsumm_pdf/11750.pdf] Executive Summary of the 2006 IOM Report ''The Future of Drug Safety: Promoting and Protecting the Health of the Public''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Allegations that the FDA covered up exportation of unsafe products===
In the 1980s, [[Cutter Laboratories]] introduced a heat-treated version of [[Factor VIII]] concentrate in the US, designed to eliminate the risk of [[HIV]] transmission. However, Cutter continued to market the untreated product overseas, potentially spreading HIV while the safer product was marketed in the US.

Cutter initially had a voluntary agreement with the FDA to stop marketing the untreated product. However, when it became clear that Cutter was not complying with the agreement, the FDA ordered the company to cease marketing untreated blood products, stating: "It was unacceptable for them to ship that material overseas." At the same time, the FDA, according to Cutter's internal documents, asked that the issue be "quietly solved without alerting the Congress, the medical community and the public", leading to charges that the FDA was complicit in covering up Cutter's actions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | work = The New York Times | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2003/05/22/business/2-paths-of-bayer-drug-in-80-s-riskier-one-steered-overseas.html | title = 2 Paths of Bayer Drug in 80's: Riskier One Steered Overseas | first = Walt | last = Bogdanovich |author2=Eric Koli | date = May 22, 2003 | accessdate = January 27, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Allegations that unsafe drugs are approved===
Some critics believe that the FDA has been too to overlook safety concerns in approving new drugs, and is slow to withdraw approved drugs once evidence shows them to be unsafe. Rezulin ([[troglitazone]]) and [[Vioxx]] (rofecoxib) are high-profile examples of drugs approved by the FDA which were later withdrawn from the market for posing unacceptable risks to patients.

[[Troglitazone]] is a [[diabetes]] drug that was also available abroad at the time the FDA approved it.  Post-marketing safety data indicated that the drug had dangerous side-effects (in this case [[liver failure]]). The drug was pulled off that market in the UK in 1997, but was not withdrawn by the FDA until 2000, before which time it is claimed that thousands of Americans were injured or killed by the drug.&lt;ref name="Graham"&gt;[https://www.senate.gov/~finance/hearings/testimony/2004test/111804dgtest.pdf] David Graham's 2004 testimony to Congress&lt;/ref&gt;

In the case of [[Vioxx]], a pre-approval study indicated that a group taking the drug had four times the risk of heart attacks when compared to another group of patients taking another anti-inflammatory, [[naproxen]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Bombardier C, Laine L, Reicin A |title=Comparison of upper gastrointestinal toxicity of rofecoxib and naproxen in patients with rheumatoid arthritis.

In 2005, the results of a randomized, placebo-controlled study showed that Vioxx users suffered a higher rate of heart attacks and other cardiovascular disorders than patients taking no medication at all.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Bresalier RS, Sandler RS, Quan H |title=Cardiovascular events associated with rofecoxib in a colorectal adenoma chemoprevention trial |journal=N.

He argued that an inherent conflict of interest exists when the office responsible for post-approval monitoring of drug safety is controlled by the same organization which initially approved those same drugs as safe and effective.  He said that after testifying against Vioxx, he was "marginalized by FDA management and not asked to participate in the evaluation of any new drug safety issues. It's a type of ostracism."&lt;ref name="Graham"/&gt; In a 2006 survey sponsored by the Union of Concerned Scientists, almost one-fifth of FDA scientists said they "have been asked, for non-scientific reasons, to inappropriately exclude or alter technical information or their conclusions in a FDA scientific document."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ucsusa.org/news/press_release/fda-scientists-pressured.html] 2006 Union of Concerned Scientists survey of FDA Scientists&lt;/ref&gt;

===Allegations that unsafe food additives and processing technologies are approved===
Food safety advocates have criticized the FDA for allowing meat manufacturers to use carbon monoxide gas mixtures during the packaging process to prevent discoloration of meat, a process that may hide signs of spoilage from the consumer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/06050/657804.stm | work=Pittsburgh Post-Gazette | title=Some raising red flag over use of gas to keep meat in the pink | date=February 19, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The FDA has been criticised for allowing the use of recombinant [[Bovine somatotropin|bovine growth hormone]] (rBGH) in dairy cows. rBGH-treated cows secrete higher levels of [[insulin-like growth factor 1]] (IGF-1) in their milk than do untreated cows. IGF-1 signalling is thought to play a role in sustaining the growth of some tumors, although there is little or no evidence that exogenously absorbed IGF could promote tumor growth. The FDA approved rBGH for use in dairy cows in 1993, after concluding that humans drinking such milk were unlikely to absorb biologically significant quantities of bovine IGF-1.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Juskevich JC, Guyer CG |title=Bovine growth hormone: human food safety evaluation |journal=Science |volume=249 |issue=4971 |pages=875–84 |date=August 1990 |pmid=2203142 |doi= 10.1126/science.2203142|url=|last2=Guyer }}&lt;/ref&gt; A 1999 report of the European Commission Scientific Committee on Veterinary Measures relating to Public Health noted that scientific questions persist regarding the theoretical health risks of milk from rBGH-treated cows, particularly for feeding to infants.&lt;ref&gt;http://ec.europa.eu/food/fs/sc/scv/out19_en.html 1999 report of the European Commission Scientific Committee on Veterinary Measures relating to Public Health&lt;/ref&gt; Since 1993, all EU countries have maintained a ban on rBGH use in dairy cattle.

The FDA has also been criticised for permitting the routine use of [[antibiotic]]s in healthy domestic animals to promote their growth, a practice which allegedly contributes to the [[evolution]] of antibiotic-resistant strains of bacteria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Myllys V, Honkanen-Buzalski T, Huovinen P, Sandholm M, Nurmi E |title=Association af changes in the bacterial ecology of bovine mastitis with changes in the use of milking machines and antibacterial drugs |journal=Acta Vet Scand |volume=35 |issue=4 |pages=363–9 |year=1994 |pmid=7676918|last2=Honkanen-Buzalski |last3=Huovinen |last4=Sandholm |last5=Nurmi }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
The FDA has taken recent steps to limit the use of antibiotics in farm animals.  In September 2005, the FDA withdrew approval for the use of the [[fluoroquinolone]] antibiotic [[enrofloxacin]] (trade name Baytril) in poultry, out of concern that this practice could promote bacterial resistance to important human antibiotics such as [[ciprofloxacin]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fda.gov/cvm/FQWithdrawal.html FDA statement on withdrawal of Baytril for use in poultry&lt;/ref&gt;

The FDA has received criticism for its approval of certain coal tar derived food dyes such as FDC [[Tartrazine|yellow 5]] and [[Sunset Yellow FCF|6]], which are banned in most European countries. On September 6, 2007, the British [[Food Standards Agency]] revised advice on certain artificial food additives, including tartrazine.

Professor Jim Stevenson from Southampton University, and author of the report, said: "This has been a major study investigating an important area of research. The results suggest that consumption of certain mixtures of artificial food colours and sodium benzoate preservative are associated with increases in hyperactive behaviour in children.

The following additives were tested in the research:
* [[Sunset Yellow FCF|Sunset yellow]] (FD&amp;C Yellow #6) – Reddish-yellow coloring used in many foods and cosmetics
* [[Azorubine|Carmoisine]] – Red coloring used in jellies
* Tartrazine (FD&amp;C Yellow #5) – Yellow coloring
* [[Ponceau 4R]] – Red coloring
* [[Sodium benzoate]] – Preservative
* [[Quinoline Yellow WS|Quinoline yellow]] – Food coloring

The FDA has also been criticized for giving permission for [[Cloning|cloned animals]] to be sold as food without any special labelling, although "cloned products may not reach the U.S. market for years." and "Authorities lack the authority to require labeling of products from cloned animals."&lt;ref&gt;Catherine Larkin, "Cloned Animals Are Safe for U.S. Food, Agency Says (Update7)", found at [https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601087&amp;sid=aqTf2NGww878&amp;refer=home Bloomberg.com website].

==Charges of FDA bias==

===Allegations of undue pharmaceutical industry influence===

====Pressure to allow pharmaceuticals====
After his resignation, from his post as Commissioner of the Food and Drugs Administration in December 1969, Dr. [[Herbert L. Ley, Jr.]]  In an interview to ''[[The New York Times]]'', warned the public about the FDA’s inability to safeguard consumers. People were being misled, he believed “The thing  that bugs me is that the people think the FDA is protecting them - it isn’t. What the FDA is doing and what the public thinks it’s doing are as different as night and day,” he said. The agency, in his opinion, did not have the motivation to protect consumers, faced budget shortfalls, and lacked support from the [[United States Department of Health and Human Services|Department of Health, Education, and Welfare]]. Dr. Ley was critical of Congress, the Administration and the drug industry, stating that he had "constant, tremendous, sometimes unmerciful pressure" from the drug industry, and that the drug company lobbyists, combined with the politicians who worked on behalf of their patrons, could bring “tremendous pressure” to bear on him and his staff, to try preventing FDA restrictions on their drugs. Ley stated that the entire issue was about money, “pure and simple”.&lt;ref&gt;Jennifer ross-nazzal.

====Viewing the pharmaceutical industry as FDA clients====
In a 2005 interview, Dr. [[David Graham (epidemiologist)|David J. Graham]], associate director of the FDA's Office of Drug Safety, stated that "FDA is inherently biased in favor of the pharmaceutical industry. It views industry as its client, whose interests it must represent and advance. It views its primary mission as approving as many drugs it can, regardless of whether the drugs are safe or needed"&lt;ref&gt;DICK CAROZZA (September/October 2005) [http://www.fraud-magazine.com/article.aspx?id=4294967770 FDA Incapable of Protecting U.S., Scientist Alleges] .

On April 14, 2017, House and Senate leaders announced a bipartisan agreement to extend the FDA’s ability to collect high user fees from drug companies and medical device manufacturers.  This allows the FDA to charge huge licensing fees to drug manufacturers, which has led to enormous increases in generic drug pricing.  In 2013 and 2014, generic drug pricing for over 200 drugs increased over 100%.  Many of those drugs had price hikes over 1000%.  It has been reported that 75% of the FDA generic drug oversight budget comes directly from private drug companies.&lt;ref&gt;http://abettersurgery.com/2017/04/19/new-bipartisan-deal-allows-drug-companies-to-reap-huge-benefits/&lt;/ref&gt;

====Bias toward more expensive drug====
A historical example of how the FDA seemingly favors the pharmaceutical industry either from clandestine direct money payments to FDA directors and scientific advisers or other undisclosed or unknown means was seen with the generic drug [[droperidol]].  Droperidol was a widely used [[antiemetic]] used perioperatively safely for over 30 years.  During that time there had never been a case reported in peer-reviewed medical literature of cardiac arrhythmias or cardiac issues when given at doses typically used for post-operative nausea and vomiting.   Nonetheless, and without warning, in 2001 the FDA issued a [[black box warning]] regarding [[QTc prolongation]] (a dangerous finding on an ECG which can lead to cardiac arrest) with the use of droperidol.  This effectively killed the common use of droperidol and made way for heavy usage of the much more expensive non-generic 5-HT3 serotonin receptor antagonists on the market even though these newer drugs had also been shown to prolong QTc as much, if not more than droperidol.  In addition, each of the 5-HT3 antagonists available at that time had peer-reviewed reports of causing significant cardiac abnormalities, and in some cases, death.  Despite an apparent discrepancy that deeply concerned the anesthesia community, the FDA persisted in keeping the black box warning, while at the same time did not place any restrictions on the  more expensive 5-HT3 antagonists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Scuderi Phillip E | year = 2005 | title = You (still) can't disprove the existence of dragons | url = | journal = Anesthesiology | volume = 102 | issue = 6| pages = 1081–1082 | doi=10.1097/00000542-200506000-00003}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Scuderi PE | year = 2003 | title = Droperidol: Many questions, few answers (editorial) | url = | journal = Anesthesiology | volume = 98 | issue = | pages = 289–90 | doi=10.1097/00000542-200302000-00002}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Habib AS, Gan TJ | year = 2003 | title = Food and drug administration black box warning on the perioperative use of droperidol: A review of the cases | doi = 10.1213/01.ane.0000063923.87560.37 | journal = Anesth Analg | volume = 96 | issue = | pages = 1377–9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = White PF | year = 2002 | title = Droperidol: A cost-effective antiemetic for over thirty years (editorial) | url = | journal = Anesth Analg | volume = 95 | issue = | pages = 789–90 | doi=10.1097/00000539-200210000-00001}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Keefe Deborah L | year = 2002 | title = The cardiotoxic potential of the 5-HT3 receptor antagonist antiemetics: is there cause for concern?. | url = | journal = The Oncologist | volume = 7 | issue = 1| pages = 65–72 | doi=10.1634/theoncologist.7-1-65}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Allegations of bias against gay men in blood donation process===
Blood collecting organizations, such as the [[American Red Cross]], have policies in accordance with FDA guidelines that prohibit accepting blood donations from any "male who has had sex with another male since 1977, even once". The inclusion of homo- and bisexual men on the prohibited list has created some controversy,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.harbus.org/2002/American-Red-Cross-Dogged-1043/ 2002 article in The Harbus regarding the blood donor guideline controversy&lt;/ref&gt; but the FDA and [[Red Cross]] cite the need to protect blood recipients from HIV as justification for the continued ban.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fda.gov/cber/faq/bldfaq.htm CBER blood products FAQ&lt;/ref&gt;  Even with [[PCR]]-based testing of blood products, a "[[window period]]" may still exist in which an HIV-positive unit of blood would test negative.  All potential donors from HIV high-risk groups are deferred for this reason, including men who have sex with men. The issue has been periodically revisited by the Blood Products Advisory Committee within the FDA Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, and was last reconfirmed on May 24, 2007.  Documentation from these meetings is available to the public.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fda.gov/ohrms/dockets/ac/acmenu.htm FDA advisory committee documents&lt;/ref&gt;

However, in 2006, the AABB, America's Blood Centers and American Red Cross recommended to the FDA that the deferral period for men who had sex with other men should be changed to be equivalent with the deferral period for heterosexual's judged to be at risk.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aabb.org/Content/Members_Area/Members_Area_Regulatory/Donor_Suitability/bpacdefernat030906.htm AABB Homepage&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The FDA chose to uphold the blood ban. Female sexual partners of [[Men who have sex with men|MSM]] (men who have sex with men) are deferred for one year since the last exposure.  This is the same policy used for any sexual partner of someone in a high-risk group.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fda.gov/oashi/aids/1992policy.html 1992 Recommendations for the prevention of Human Immunodeficiency Virus Transmission by Blood and Blood Products&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070629190236/http://www.fda.gov/oashi/aids/1992policy.html |date=June 29, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The intent of these policies is to ensure that blood is collected from a population that is at low risk for disease, since the tests are not perfect and human error may lead to infected units not being properly discarded.  The policy was first put in place in 1985.&lt;ref name="harbus"&gt;{{cite web | title=American Red Cross Dogged by Allegations of Discrimination (published: January 28, 2002) |publisher=The Harvard business school newspaper |url=http://www.harbus.org/2002/American-Red-Cross-Dogged-1043/ | accessdate=2006-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Criticism of FDA's rejection of medical cannabis===
In April 2005, the FDA issued a statement asserting that [[Cannabis (drug)|cannabis]] had no medical value and should not be accepted as a medicine, despite a great deal of research suggesting the opposite.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5356029 FDA on Medical Marijuana: Science or Politics?] Joanne Silberner&lt;/ref&gt; The supporters of [[medical cannabis]] legalization criticized the FDA's statement as a politically motivated one instead of one based on solid science. A group of congressmen led by [[Maurice Hinchey]] wrote a letter to FDA's commissioner [[Andrew von Eschenbach]], expressing their disapproval of the FDA's statement and pointed out the FDA's rejection of medical cannabis was inconsistent with the findings of the [[Institute of Medicine]], which stated cannabis does have medical benefits.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.safeaccessnow.org/article.php?id=3343 Hinchey Leads Bipartisan House Coalition In Calling For FDA] [[Americans for Safe Access]]&lt;/ref&gt; While the FDA has not approved marijuana it has approved THC (a compound found in cannabis) as an active ingredient for medicinal use.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.usdoj.gov/dea/ongoing/marinol.html "Medical" Marijuana – The Facts]&lt;/ref&gt; Critics argue that this approval is a politically motivated attempt to allow special interest groups to have patents over the substance,&lt;ref&gt;[http://media.www.thetigernews.com/media/storage/paper863/news/2005/02/04/News/Researchers.Scramble.For.Thc.Patent-1991694.shtml Researchers scramble for THC patent]&lt;/ref&gt; perhaps because the patents on previously patented competing substances have expired.

{{History of Spain}}
In the [[Iberian peninsula]], the '''crown rabbi''' ([[Spanish language|Spanish]]: '''{{lang|es|rabino mayor}}''' or [[Old Portuguese]]: '''{{lang|pt|arrabi mor}}''' (''chief rabbi'') ) was a secular, administrative post occupied by a member of the Jewish community for the benefit of the governing state, and existed in the kingdoms of [[Kingdom of Castile|Castile]], [[Kingdom of Aragon|Aragon]], [[Kingdom of Navarre|Navarre]] and [[Kingdom of Portugal|Portugal]] as far back as the 13th century, and is referred to as '''crown rabbi''' by historians in English, as well as by '''court rabbi''' and other terms.

== Terminology ==

In Spanish this position was known as ''[[:es:rabino mayor|rabino mayor]]'' or {{lang|es|rab de la corte}}, which can be translated literally as "chief rabbi" or "court rabbi", respectively, and which is referred to in some English sources as "crown rabbi"&lt;ref name="Kaplan2010"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |encyclopedia=The YIVO Encyclopedia of Jews in Eastern Europe |editor-last1=Kaplan Appel |editor-first1=Tamar |editor-link1= |title=Crown Rabbi |last1= |first1= |author-link1= |url=http://www.yivoencyclopedia.org/article.aspx/Crown_Rabbi |date=3 August 2010 |publisher=Yale University Press |location= |edition= |series= |volume= |isbn=9780300119039 |oclc=170203576 |pages= |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150327120806/http://www.yivoencyclopedia.org/article.aspx/Crown_Rabbi |archivedate=2015-03-27 |accessdate=2015-05-31 |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ray-2004" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Burns2015" /&gt;&lt;ref name="EB-Crescas" /&gt; and in others as "court rabbi".&lt;ref name="Berlin-2011" /&gt;&lt;ref name="JE-1906-Senior" /&gt;  In Sicily (part of Aragon) the position was known locally as the ''[[Dayan (rabbinic judge)|dayyan]] kalali''&lt;ref name="Stow-2009" /&gt; and in Portuguese  as ''arrabi-mor''.&lt;ref name="Herculano-1854" /&gt;&lt;ref name="oap-1903" /&gt;&lt;ref name="SingerAdler1907" /&gt;  The derivation of arrabi mor is through a very unusual, three-language merger of parts in [[Judaeo-Portuguese]], from Hebrew ''rabi'' (noun, "rabbi") preceded by [[Arabic definite article]] ''ar'' ("the", from [[Sun and moon letters|''al'' + initial ''r-'' consonsant]]), and Portuguese ''mor'' (''adj.'', "chief", in [[Portuguese_grammar#Adjectives|normal postposition]]).&lt;ref name="Wexler-2006"&gt;{{cite book |last=Wexler |first=Paul  |title=Jewish and Non-Jewish Creators of "Jewish" Languages: With Special Attention to Judaized Arabic, Chinese, German, Greek, Persian, Portuguese, Slavic (modern Hebrew/Yiddish), Spanish, and Karaite, and Semitic Hebrew/Ladino ; a Collection of Reprinted Articles from Across Four Decades with a Reassessment |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ic5Kth7aiusC&amp;pg=PA513 |year=2006 |publisher=Otto Harrassowitz Verlag |location=Wiesbaden |isbn=978-3-447-05404-1 |page=513 |chapter=IX.

== History ==

The concept of an official rabbi performing administrative duties and acting as an intermediary existed as far back as the 13th century in the kingdoms of [[Kingdom of Castile|Castile]], [[Kingdom of Aragon|Aragon]], and [[Kingdom of Portugal|Portugal]] and elsewhere in the Iberian peninsula. 

The crown rabbi was one of the chief ways for the kingdoms in the peninsula to exert power over their Jewish communities. Those officials fulfilling this position often acquired significant secular power over their communities, and sometimes over provinces or even kingdoms.&lt;ref name="Ray-2004"&gt;{{cite book |editor=Jack Wertheimer |date=2004-03-20 |title=Jewish Religious Leadership: Image and Reality, Vol. 1 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PvUlAQAAIAAJ |volume=I |page=307-332 |chapter=Royal Authority and the Jewish Community: The Crown Rabbi in Medieval Spain and Portugal |last=Ray |first=Jonathan |publisher=Jewish Theological Seminary |isbn=978-0873340977 |doi= |oclc= |access-date=2014-03-19 |quote=One of the most significant ways in which royal power came to influence the Jewish community was through the development of the post of Crown Rabbi, a product of the general expansion of royal administrations, which took place throughout the Iberian kingdoms in the second half of the thirteenth century.  Buttressed by the royal court, these Jewish magistrates quickly became the preeminent fiscal and judicial authorities with the local Jewish community ([[aljama]]) and in some instances, over the Jewries of entire provinces and kingdoms.  The nature and development of the rabbinate is one of the most important and controversial issues in medieval Jewish history, and a comprehensive study of the topic remains a desideratum. ... The common designation of "rabbi" used to describe both traditional Jewish legists and Jewish officials appointed by the crown has led some scholars to confuse the two. This confusion stems, in large part, from the relatively fluid and imprecise manner with which medieval Christian documents employ various renderings of the Hebrew term ''rav'' (lit. "teacher"), such as ''rabi'', ''arrabi'', ''rab'' and ''rap''. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Castile and Aragon===

In Castile, the Court Rabbinate extended as an institution from 1255 until [[Alhambra Decree|Expulsion]] in 1492.  They were often laymen, not rabbis, and had near dictatorial authority of their flock.  They presided in appeals cases and international synods, and might also be a court physician, as well as tax collector over both the Jewish as well as the Christian community.  The last one to hold the office of crown rabbi of Castile was [[Abraham Seneor]] who became a ''[[converso]]'' rather than be expelled.&lt;ref name="Stow-2009"&gt;{{cite book|last=Stow|first=Kenneth|title=Alienated Minority: The Jews of Medieval Latin Europe|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kfLmJK-h3UIC&amp;pg=PA163|accessdate=5 June 2015|date=1 June 2009|publisher=Harvard University Press|location=Cambridge, Mass.|isbn=978-0-674-04405-0|page=163}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1386 in the [[Kingdom of Aragon]] for example, King [[John I of Aragon|John I]] in the context of a time of political reform, issued edicts defining the functions and duties of the {{lang|es|Rab Mayor}} as intermediary between the power of the kingdom and that of the ''[[aljama]]'', or Jewish community.  There were various requirements as to the good character and faith of the person holding this charge, as well as a requirement that he live among the entourage of the Court, and thus away from his community, and in constant contact with the Christian majority population. His powers and authorities over the {{lang|es|aljama}} of Castile, economic, judicial, and otherwise, were specified.&lt;ref name="Alvarez-2001"&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://dialnet.unirioja.es/servlet/articulo?codigo=209673 |journal=Edad Media: revista de historia (Middle Ages: History Magazine |language=Spanish |title=El cargo de Rab Mayor de la Corte según un documento de Juan II fechado en 1450 (The post of ''Rab Mayor'' in the Court according to a document of John II issued in 1450) |last1=Crespo Álvarez |first1=Macarena |date=2001 |website= |publisher=Á |volume= |number=4 |issn=1138-9621 |issue= |pages=157-198 |doi= |accessdate= |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===the ''arrabi'' in Portugal===

In Portugal, the ''arrabi'' was a Jewish official who acted as a private municipal judge in a locality, chosen from among the community.&lt;ref name="Herculano-1854" /&gt;  

The term ''arrabi'' is attested from the late 12th century in Latin and Portuguese under [[Afonso III of Portugal|Afonso III]], and is mentioned in a judicial sense in municipal legislation documents.  Sometimes it appears as ''Rabi''.  Documents from [[Lisbon]], [[Leiria]] and elsewhere suggest that there was one ''arrabi'' per community, who was an outpost of royal authority, parallel to and separate from the traditional rabbi who tended to their flock's religious and spiritual needs.&lt;ref name="Ray-2006"&gt;{{cite book |last=Ray |first=Jonathan |title=The Sephardic Frontier: The Reconquista and the Jewish Community in Medieval Iberia |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wSXsSxs6n_8C&amp;pg=PA124 |accessdate=4 June 2015 |year=2006 |publisher=Cornell University Press |location=Ithaca, NY |isbn=0-8014-4401-2 |chapter=5. Jewish Communal Organization and Authority |pages=124–128 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Presiding above the ''arrabis'' was a high functionary of the crown known as the ''arrabi mor'' (or arrabi-môr; ''chief rabbi'') and reporting to the King.&lt;ref name="Ray-2006" /&gt;  Besides supervising the administration of justice, he also was in charge of fiscal administration&lt;ref name="Ray-2006" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Herculano-1854"&gt;{{cite book |last=Herculano |first=Alexandre |title=História da origem e estabelecimento da Inquisição em Portugal |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xshGAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA86 |volume=Tomo I. |year=1854 |publisher=Imprensa Nacional |location=Lisbon |page=86 |language=Portuguese |trans-title=History of the Origin and Establishment of the Inquisition in Portugal |accessdate=5 June 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and presided over the ''ouvidores'' (auditors) of the kingdom.&lt;ref name="oap-1903"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Cardozo de Bethencourt |editor=J Leite de Vasconcellos |journal=O Archeólogo português |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EXQNAQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA37 |accessdate=5 June 2015 |volume=8 |date=March 1903 |publisher=Museu Ethnográphico Português |language=Portuguese, French |page=37 |title=Inscriptions Hébraïques du Portugal |trans-title=Hebrew Inscriptions of Portugal |number=2 |quote=Dans la grande division administrative du Judaisme Portugais, vers 1402, Faro fut le siege de l'un des sept auditeurs, ''ouvidores'', relevant de l{{'}}''arrabi-mor.}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The position of ''arrabi mor'' emerged in Portugal as a result of efforts begun in the 12th century to centralize the legal and fiscal system in the country.  By the late 13th century this effort extended to all of Portuguese Jewry, as manifested by the creation of a network of Jewish officials in each locality.  The head of this network was the ''arrabi mor'' (chief rabbi) who acted as the royal tax collector similar to the position of the ''almoxarife mayor''&lt;ref name="Ray-2006" /&gt; (chief financial administrator&lt;ref name="Roth2014"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |encyclopedia=Medieval Jewish Civilization: An Encyclopedia |editor-last1=Roth |editor-first1=Norman |editor-link1= |title=Abravanel Family |last1=Roth |first1=Norman  |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hvhRAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA6 |date=8 April 2014 |publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis |orig-year=2003 |location=New York |edition= |series= |volume= |isbn=978-1-136-77154-5 |oclc=827973299 |pages=6 |access-date=2015-06-08 |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;) in Castile.  Under him were seven officials also called ''arrabis'' or ''ouvidores'' (auditors) who were responsible for taxes in their region (''arrabiado''); the local ''arrabis'' were assigned to individual communities after the model in Castile and Aragon.&lt;ref name="Ray-2006" /&gt;

The high post tended to be filled by wealthy Jews, and the post was handed down and controlled by family dynasties.  The first ''arrabi mor'' mentioned was Don Judah in the 13th century under [[Denis of Portugal|King Dinis]], followed by his son Guedelha. The main duties were judicial, and fiscal.  Judicially, the decisions of the ''arrabi mor'' concerning matters in the Jewish community were final, per a decree by [[Afonso III of Portugal|Afonso III]] in 1266, and he was responsible only for the highest issues, as the simpler suits and appeals were judged by the local ''arrabis''.&lt;ref name="Ray-2006" /&gt;

A powerful ''arrabi-mor'' could sometimes influence the laws of the kingdom in favor of the ''aljama''.&lt;ref name="SingerAdler1907"&gt;{{citation |last1=Singer |first1=Isidore |authorlink1=Isidore Singer |last2=Adler |first2=Cyrus |authorlink2=Cyrus Adler |title=The Jewish Encyclopedia: A Descriptive Record of the History, Religion, Literature, and Customs of the Jewish People from the Earliest Times to the Present Day |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eTsyAQAAMAAJ |accessdate=5 June 2015 |year=1907 |publisher=Funk &amp; Wagnalls Company |location=New York |page=193 |chapter=Moses Navarro |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eTsyAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA193}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Such a man was Moses Navarro under King [[John I of Portugal]].  Following the carnage and forced conversions in the [[History of the Jews in Spain#Massacre of 1391|1391 massacre]] of Jews in Seville and its aftermath in other kingdoms of the Iberian peninsula, the devastation threatened to spill across the border into Portugal, but Moses Navarro exercised his power and influence with the monarch and his knowledge of edicts from the [[Catholic Church|Vatican]] by Popes [[Boniface IX]] and [[Clement VI]] friendly to Jews to prevent any harm from coming to Portuguese Jewry.&lt;ref name="Kayserling1867"&gt;{{cite book |last=Kayserling |first=Meyer |authorlink=Meyer Kayserling |title=Geschichte der Juden in Portugal |trans-title=History of the Jews in Portugal |page=25 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7S0rYUA2kIwC |accessdate=5 June 2015 |year=1867 |publisher=Oskar Leiner |location=Leipzig |language=German |quote=That the fanaticism of this period did not claim victims in Portugal as well, was primarily due to the measures taken by then chief rabbi D. Moses Navarro.  Full of apprehension, the clergy in an excess of zeal could become carried away by such labors of love here as well.  In Coimbra at the end of 1391, the chief rabbi (who was also the king's personal physician) acting on behalf of all of Portuguese Jewry, presented his Lord and King a [[papal bull]] of [[Pope Boniface IX]] dated July 2, 1389, which in turn was based on an earlier edict of July 5, 1347 by a predecessor, namely the Jewish-friendly [[Pope Clement VI]]. In this bull, which was especially translated into Portuguese, it was strictly forbidden for a Christian to force a Jew to be baptised, or to strike him, rob him, or slay him; or to interrupt the [[Jewish festivals]] and ceremonies, or to disturb their cemeteries, dig up Jewish corpses, or by means of force to induce Jews to perform a job or a service which they were not legally obliged to perform in earlier times.  According to a decree issued in Coimbra on July 17, 1392, [[John I of Portugal|King John]] not only publicized the bull in all cities of the kingdom, but also promulgated a law to the same effect. &amp;nbsp; {{gray|Dass der Fanatismus um diese Zeit nicht auch in Portugal seine Opfer forderte, war vornehmlich den Vorkehrungen des damaligen Oberrabiners D. Moses Navarro zu danken.  Voller Besorgniß, die Geistlichkeit könnte in ihrem übernatürlichen Eifer sich auch hier zu solchen Liebesdiensten hinreißen lassen, überreichte der Oberrabbiner, der auch zugleich des Königs Leibarzt war, seinem Herrn und Könige gegen Ende des Jahres 1391 in Coimbra im Namen der ganzen portugiesischen Judenheit eine Bulle des Papstes Bonifacius IX vom 2. Juli 1389, der ein Früherer Erlaß eines Vorgängers desselben, des judenfreundlichen Papstes Clemens VI, vom 5. Juli 1347 zu Grunde lag. In dieser, eigens ins Portugiesische übersetzten Bulle wurde aufs Strengste verboten, daß ein Christ einen Juden zur Taufe zwinge, ihn Schlage, beraube oder tödte, die Fest- und Feierlichkeiten der Juden störe, ihre Begräbnißplätze verletze, die jüdischen Leichen ausgrabe und die Juden zu einem Dienste oder einer Arbeit mit Gewalt verhalte, zu denen sie in früheren Zeiten gezetzlich nicht verpflichtet waren. Diese Bullen liess D. João, laut einer in Coimbra am 17. Juli 1392 getroffenen Verfügung, nicht allein in allen Städten des Reiches publiciren, er erliess auch gleichzeitig ein dem Inhalte derselben analoges Gesetz.}} }}&lt;/ref&gt;  King John upon hearing of the edicts, immediately promulgated a law on July 17, 1392 prohibiting any persecution, which was obeyed gladly by his subjects due to the extent of his popularity in the land.  As a result, Portugal became a safe haven for Jews escaping persecution in Spain.&lt;ref name="Graetz-1897"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Graetz |first1=Heinrich |authorlink1=Heinrich Graetz |author2=Philipp Bloch |title=History of the Jews |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MIMrAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA173 |volume=IV.

The first draft of the 442-page ''CryptoParty Handbook'' (the hard copy of which is available at cost), was pulled together in three days using the [[book sprint]] approach,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20121009/06132920660/cryptoparty-like-its-1993.shtml |title=CryptoParty Like It's 1993 |publisher=Techdirt |date=2012-10-11 |accessdate=2013-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was released 2012-10-04 under a [[CC-BY-SA]] license; it remains under constant revision.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://cryptoparty.org/wiki/CryptoPartyHandbook |title=CryptoPartyHandbook |publisher=CryptoParty |date=2013-01-31 |accessdate=2013-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Attack and site takedown==

In April and May 2013, the movement's main wiki page, cryptoparty.org, was subject to a series of [[Spamming|spam attack]]s that eventually resulted in the site being taken out of service. Protection against spam attacks was rendered more difficult than on other wikis by a site-specific policy permitting edits from users employing anonymization services. Spam attacks were also facilitated by the use of inappropriate MediaWiki settings in ConfirmEdit plugin. The use of [[Captcha|SimpleCaptcha]] is not recommended by the ConfirmEdit authors (" [...] used by very few wikis outside WMF if any, probably because of scarce effectiveness").&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Extension:ConfirmEdit#Not_recommended ConfirmEdit, Mediawiki extension.] mediawiki.org 15-06-2013. Retrieved 23-06-2013&lt;/ref&gt;

==Edward Snowden involvement==

In May 2014, ''Wired'' reported that Edward Snowden, while employed by [[Dell]] as an NSA contractor, organized a local CryptoParty at a small [[hackerspace]] in [[Honolulu]], [[Hawaii]] on December 11, six months before becoming well known for leaking tens of thousands of secret U.S. government documents. During the CryptoParty, Snowden taught 20 Hawaii residents how to encrypt their hard drives and use the Internet anonymously. The event was filmed by Snowden's then-girlfriend, but the video has never been released online. In a follow-up post to the CryptoParty wiki,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://besva.de/mirror-cryptoparty.org/wiki/Oahu.html |title=Snowden's Post in the CryptoParty Wiki |date=2012 |accessdate=2015-03-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Snowden pronounced the event a "huge success."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Kevin Poulsen |url=https://www.wired.com/2014/05/snowden-cryptoparty/ |title=Snowden's First Move Against the NSA Was a Party in Hawaii |publisher=Wired |date=2014-05-21 |accessdate=2014-05-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Cyber defamation''' is not a specific criminal offense, misdemeanor or tort, but rather defamation or slander conducted via digital media, usually through the [[Internet]].

Penalties for "cyber defamation" vary from country to country, but the fundamental rights covered in the UN Declaration of Human Rights and [[European Union]] Fundamental Human Rights.&lt;ref&gt;[http://europa.eu/legislation_summaries/human_rights/fundamental_rights_within_european_union/index_en.htm EU Fundamental Rights]&lt;/ref&gt;

Stopping or addressing defamation can be difficult. If the person has no serious grudge, then a cease and desist letter may stop the behavior and get the statements removed from the Internet. On the other hand, if the person is acting out of spite, it may be necessary to file a report with the police depending on local law.

== South Korea ==

The cyber defamation law that the [[Government of South Korea|Korean government]] pursues allows police to crack down on hateful comments without any reports from victims.  The only country where such cyber defamation law is being implemented is [[China]].   [[South Korea]] is the first democratic country in the process of introducing the law.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/opinon/2009/02/202_29634.html Growing Responsibility] 08-19-2008 [[The Korea Times|Korea Times]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Korea Communications Commission]] (KCC), South Korea's telecommunications and broadcasting regulator, has been considering revising the current Telecommunications Law and put more regulations and deeper scrutiny on major Internet portals.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/biz/2008/12/123_36365.html Online Portals Face More Regulation, Deeper Scrutiny] 12-18-2008 by Kim Tong-hyung Korea Times&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Controversies ===
There have been talks about introducing the stricter laws in cyberspace.  A famous celebrity's suicide in South Korea,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/opinon/2009/02/202_32176.html Insults on Internet] 10-05-2008 Korea Times&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.straitstimes.com/Breaking%2BNews/Asia/Story/STIStory_289173.html Seoul rushes Internet Bill] Oct 13, 2008 by Lee Tee Jong, South Korea Correspondent, [[The Straits Times]]&lt;/ref&gt; triggered the controversies once again as to whether such law is necessary. The law supported by the governing [[Grand National Party]] (GNP), if implemented, will allow police to investigate the cyber defamation cases without any complaints of the victims. The opposition [[Democratic Party (South Korea, 2008)|Democratic Party]] has been against the introduction of such law.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/nation/2009/01/116_37632.html Parties Clash Over Freedom of Expression] 01-11-2009 by Kang Hyun-kyung, Korea Times&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Advocate views ====
* The current laws have failed to prevent the number of the victims from increasing at an escalating rate.
* [[Freedom of speech]] comes with responsibility.
* Because information and rumors can travel in a matter of seconds across the Internet, [[cyber-bullying]] and cyber defamation could take a significant toll on each victim without such strict regulations by authorities.

==== Opposing views ====
* There are already ways to regulate the cyberspace with the current laws.
* It is potentially possible for the law to be exploited by authorities in an attempt to crack down on people who express opposite views.
* Such law might cause a harmful effect on [[freedom of speech]].
* "Defamation" is too ambiguous to be defined by a third party, other than the victims.

=== Survey ===
A Research &amp; Research survey of 800 Korean people conducted on Jan. 14, 2009 showed that 60% supported the [[Grand National Party|GNP]]-led bill dealing with cyber defamation, and 32.1% opposed it.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/nation/2009/01/116_37888.html 50% Say 'Green New Deal' Will Boost Economy] 01-15-2009 By Kang Hyun-kyung, Korea Times&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Celebrities' suicide ===
Some Korean celebrities have suffered from severe depression, caused in part by malicious online comments, before committing suicide.
*[[Lee Eun-ju]]
*[[Jung Da Bin]]
*[[U;Nee]]
* [[Choi Jin-sil]]

=== Online gaming ===
Vast majority of cyber defamation police reports arise from online games. League of Legends is a game which is notorious for such acts. In 2015 alone, South Korean law enforcement received and investigated over 8000 reports of cyber defamation; over half of these cases involve League of Legends where players head to police stations as a retaliation after being verbally abused by teammates or opponents. &lt;ref&gt;[http://m.hankookilbo.com/news/read/201509100455164359]&lt;/ref&gt;

There are even 'settlement fee hunters', where players enter games and grief with intention of being insulted by other players. In some cases, such settlement fee hunters file police reports against over 50 other individuals at once. Most of the victims of settlement fee hunters are teenagers, since many parents are willing to pay settlement fees ranging from 300 thousand to 2 million KRW (300 to 2000 USD) to avoid their children having to go to trial and risk gaining criminal records.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1166">The '''Decree''', or '''Firman''', '''of Muharram''' can refer to a number of [[decree]]s or [[firman (decree)|firman]]s issued by the [[Ottoman Empire]] in the [[Islamic calendar|Islamic month]] of [[Muharram]]. The most important of which, both issued by [[‘Abdu’l-Hamid II]] during the [[decline of the Ottoman Empire]], are:

* Firman issued in Muharram 1299 [[Islamic calendar|AH]] (December 1881 [[Common Era|CE]]) which turned over a large proportion of the Ottoman Empire's revenue to the [[Ottoman Public Debt Administration|Public Debt Administration]] for the repayment of foreign creditors, practically [[National bankruptcy|bankrupting]] the Ottomans after the [[Russo-Turkish War, 1877-1878]].
* Firman issued on 5 Muharram 1311 [[Islamic calendar|AH]] (18 July 1893 [[Common Era|CE]]) which regarded the appointment of a [[Chief Rabbi]] of [[Jerusalem]] and the rights of the [[Jew]]ish community in that province.[http://www.sephardicstudies.org/firman.html]

Additionally, the term may be used to refer to the [[Islam]]ic tradition that it is unlawful (''[[haraam|haram]]'') to go to war in Muharram.

'''''[[John Doe|Doe]] v. Unocal''''', [http://openjurist.org/395/f3d/932 395 F.3d 932] ([[United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit|9th Cir.]] 2002), opinion vacated and rehearing en banc granted, 395 F.3d 978 (9th Cir. 2003), was a lawsuit filed against [[Unocal]] for alleged human rights violations.

==Events==
In September 1996, four [[Burma|Burmese]] villagers filed suit against [[Unocal]] and its parent company, the Union Oil Company of California under the [[Alien Tort Claims Act]] (also known as the Alien Tort Statute), and in October 1996, another fourteen villagers also brought suit.&lt;ref&gt;''Doe I v. Unocal Corp.'',
395 F.3d 932, 942-43 (9th Cir. 2002)&lt;/ref&gt; The suits alleged various human rights violations, including forced labor, wrongful death, false imprisonment, assault, intentional infliction of emotional distress and negligence, all relating to the construction of the [[Yadana Project|Yadana gas pipeline project]] in [[Myanmar]], formerly Burma.  In September and October 2000, some of those plaintiffs also filed lawsuits in the Superior Court of California for many of the same state-law tort claims.&lt;ref name=complaint-state-b&gt;{{cite web |url=http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b0/Doe_v_Unocal_Plaintiffs_Complaint_and_conformed_face_sheet.pdf |format=PDF|title=Plaintiff's Complaint for Damages |date=2000-09-29 |accessdate=2007-12-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Case==
EarthRights International, the [[Center for Constitutional Rights]], Paul Hoffman, Hadsell &amp; Stormer, and [[Judith Brown Chomsky]] served as co-counsel to the plaintiffs. 

In 1997, a U.S. federal district court in Los Angeles agreed to hear ''Doe v. Unocal''. The Court ruled that corporations and their executive officers can be held legally responsible under the Alien Tort Claims Act for violations of international human rights norms in foreign countries, and that U.S. courts have the authority to adjudicate such claims. In 2000, the district court dismissed the case on the grounds that Unocal could not be held liable unless Unocal wanted the military to commit abuses, and that plaintiffs had not made this showing. 

Plaintiffs appealed this decision, and on September 18, 2002, a three-judge panel of the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit]] reversed portions of the district court’s decision, allowing the lawsuit against Unocal to go forward. [http://openjurist.org/395/f3d/932 395 F.3d 932].  However, in February 2003, the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit|Ninth Circuit Court]] vacated the panel decision and agreed to rehear the appeal before an eleven-judge ''en banc'' panel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.earthrights.org/site_blurbs/doe_v._unocal_case_history.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-07-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090715024320/http://www.earthrights.org/site_blurbs/doe_v._unocal_case_history.html |archivedate=2009-07-15 |df= }} EarthRights Int'l, ''Doe v. Unocal'' Case History&lt;/ref&gt;

Following a ruling in the California state court actions that would have permitted those cases to proceed toward a trial as to Unocal's liability, and shortly prior to when the case was to be argued before the Ninth Circuit ''en banc'' court in December 2004 (the argument had been delayed in order to address the impact of the recent [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] ruling in ''[[Sosa v. Alvarez-Machain]]''), the parties announced that they had reached a tentative settlement.  Once the settlement was finalized in March 2005, the federal appeal was withdrawn and the state cases were voluntarily dismissed.  According to a joint statement released by the parties, "the settlement will compensate plaintiffs and provide funds enabling plaintiffs and their representatives to develop programs to improve living conditions, health care and education and protect the rights of people from the pipeline region. These initiatives will provide substantial assistance to people who may have suffered hardships in the region."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.earthrights.org/legalfeature/final_settlement_reached_in_doe_v._unocal.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-10-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090715025607/http://www.earthrights.org/legalfeature/final_settlement_reached_in_doe_v._unocal.html |archivedate=2009-07-15 |df= }} EarthRights Int'l, ''Doe v.

In the Holy Roman Empire, the '''Domfreiheit''' ([[German language|German]]: Cathedral Freedom) or '''Domimmunität''' (Cathedral Immunity) was the area immediately around the seat of the [[Bishop]] of a [[cathedral]] and its [[cathedral chapter]], which was managed by the [[Domdechant]]; the English term is [[cathedral close]]. This area stretched only a few hundred metres from the outbuildings of the cathedral, at most, and was usually surrounded by a fortified wall ([[Domburg (civic structure)|Domburg]]). They belonged to the secular domain or [[Hochstift]] of the bishop.

The area of the Domfreiheit was not part of the surrounding city's jurisdiction, but had its own jurisdiction, which included both the clergy and their servants. It contained the residences of the [[Domherr]]en and their staff. This area was not subject to civic taxes - hence the term "''Freiheit''" (Freedom). There were, thus, two distinct sovereign entities within the city walls.

This led to ever greater tension in many cities over the centuries, as is clear, for example, from the entry for 1612 in the Speyerer Chronicle by town secretary Christoph Lehmen. He says: "There have been many long and distinct quarrels between the citizenry and the clergy in the state. Therefore [[Rudolf II, Holy Roman Emperor|King Rudolph]] ordained by treaty that the civic council should be in charge of it."

Where the [[Reformation]] found root, most cloisters were secularised and, as a rule, the Domfreiheit also ceased to exist. It did not last much longer in the cities which remained Catholic. With the secularisation of the [[Diocese of Bremen]] as [[Bremen-Verden]] in 1648, after almost eighty years as a [[Lutheran]] bishopric, its [[Dombezirk, Bremen|Domfreiheit]] in the centre of the city came under [[Sweden|Swedish]] control. From 1715 it belonged to [[Electorate of Brunswick-Lüneburg|Hanover]] and only in 1803 did it come under the control of the surrounding city.
After the abolition of the [[Diocese of Ratzeburg]] in the Reformation, its property was incorporated into the [[Principality of Ratzeburg]], which was awarded to the duchy of [[Mecklenburg]] in 1648 and formed the western part of [[Grand Duchy of Mecklenburg-Strelitz|Mecklenburg-Strelitz]] after 1701. The rest of the city of Ratzeburg, however, belonged to the [[Saxe-Lauenburg|Duch of Lauenburg]].

Relatively well preserved Domfreiheiten include those in [[Halberstadt]], [[Hildesheim]], [[Magdeburg]], [[Merseburg]], [[Münster]], [[Meissen]], [[Naumburg]] und [[Trier]].

The '''duty of fair representation''' is incumbent upon [[United States|U.S.]] [[trade union|labor unions]] that are the exclusive bargaining representative of workers in a particular group. It is the obligation to represent all employees fairly, in good faith, and without discrimination. Originally recognized by the [[United States Supreme Court]] in a series of cases in the mid-1940s involving racial discrimination by railway workers' unions covered by the [[Railway Labor Act]], the duty of fair representation also applies to workers covered by the [[National Labor Relations Act]] and, depending on the terms of the statute, to public sector workers covered by state and local laws regulating labor relations.

==Application==
The duty applies to virtually every action that a union might take in dealing with an employer as the representative of employees, from its negotiation of the terms of a [[collective bargaining agreement]], to its handling of grievances arising under that agreement, as well as its operation of an exclusive [[hiring hall]] and its enforcement of the [[union shop|union security]] provisions of a collective bargaining agreement. However, the duty does not ordinarily apply to rights that a worker can enforce independently; the union has no duty to assist the employees it represents in filing claims under a [[workers' compensation]] statute or other laws.

The duty likewise does not apply for the most part to unions' internal affairs, such as their right to discipline employees for violation of the union's own rules or union officers' handling of union funds, which are regulated instead by the [[Labor Management Reporting and Disclosure Act]]. The courts have, on the other hand, applied the same principles that govern the duty of fair representation to union members' suits to enforce union constitutions.

==Courts' view==
Generally the courts have taken a deferential approach to reviewing unions' decisions challenged as a breach of their duty of fair representation. Recognizing that the collective bargaining process typically requires compromises, which may favor some workers at the expense of others, the courts have held that a union only breaches its duty if it acts arbitrarily, in bad faith or discriminatorily. Practical considerations have also led the courts to refuse to second-guess unions' decisions: if a court or jury could substitute its judgment as to whether a particular grievance had merit, then unions could not function, since their decisions would rarely be final in any practical sense. Accordingly, the courts have refused to overturn union decisions as arbitrary so long as they were based on a reasoned decision by the union, even if the court might believe that this decision was wrong.

==New applications==
In recent years the courts and the [[National Labor Relations Board]] have applied the duty of fair representation to regulate the manner in which unions enforce the union security provisions of a collective bargaining agreement. Unlike the standard applied to unions' decisions concerning grievance handling and collective bargaining negotiations, the courts and the Board have regulated this area very extensively. They have specified the types of expenses that a union can include in the fees that it charges employees who choose not to join the union but are required to pay dues under an agency shop or union shop clause, the accounting procedures used to calculate those amounts, the procedures which the union and employees must follow if an individual worker objects to paying the full amount of dues or challenges the union's calculation of the lesser amount that non-members can be required to pay, and the procedures that the union must follow before it can force the employer to fire an employee for non-payment of dues. Even stricter standards are applied to unions covered by the Railway Labor Act and to unions of governmental employees on constitutional grounds.

The NLRB applies a similarly strict standard in reviewing unions' enforcement of exclusive hiring halls, i.e., those in which the employer is bound, by contract, to hire only employees referred to it by the union. The NLRB requires unions to establish clear procedures and to follow those procedures in order to minimize the likelihood that the union would use a hiring hall procedure to exclude non-members or those out of favour with the union from the workplace. On the other hand, the NLRB applies the more deferential standard applied to union decisions generally in the case of non-exclusive hiring halls, i.e., those in which the union has the power to refer applicants for employment but the employer may also hire employees "off the street"; in those cases the union is barred from acting arbitrarily, in bad faith or discriminatorily.

==Violations==
The NLRB recognizes a breach of the duty of fair representation as a violation of the National Labor Relations Act. However, because the duty of fair representation was originally created by judicial interpretation, rather than as an express statutory prohibition, employees covered by the National Labor Relations Act may sue their unions directly, without being required to first exhaust any administrative procedures provided under the National Labor Relations Board. The same is true for workers covered by the Railway Labor Act, which does not provide any administrative procedure for pursuing claims against a union. Employees' claims under either Act are governed by a six-month [[statute of limitations]].

The NLRB and the courts provide different solutions against unions that breached their duty of fair representation. Because the Board does not usually have the jurisdiction to enforce the collective bargaining agreement or to issue a remedial order against an employer that has violated it, the NLRB often cannot award complete relief to employees. A court, on the other hand, may order an employer to reinstate or pay back pay to an employee if it finds that the employer violated the collective bargaining agreement and may, in some instances, order the union to pay attorneys' fees to a successful plaintiff. These distinctions do not apply to workers covered by the Railway Labor Act since, as noted above, they have no administrative procedures to enforce their rights.

A union may, in some limited circumstances, require employees to exhaust any internal appeals procedures provided under the union's constitution before filing suit. Unions and employers may also generally require employees to exhaust their rights under the grievance arbitration procedures provided for under the collective bargaining agreement before suing the employer for breach of contract. However employees do not usually have to exhaust such procedures if they are suing only the union, since very few collective bargaining agreements even allow for the filing of a grievance against the union by covered employees. To the extent that an employee might have a breach of contract claim against a union arising out of its performance of its duty to represent that employee, the courts will apply the same deferential standards and procedural requirements that they would employ if the worker sued the union on a breach of the duty of fair representation theory.

The '''European Law Students' Association''' ('''ELSA''') is an international, independent, non-political, non-profit, [[non-governmental organisation]] run by and for law students. ELSA-activities comprise a large variety of academic and professional events that are organised to fulfill the stated vision of ELSA.

==History==
Five law students from [[Austria]], [[Hungary]], [[Poland]] and [[West Germany]] founded ELSA on 4 May 1981. It claims to be the world's largest independent law students association and to be represented at nearly 375 law faculties in 44 countries&lt;ref&gt;https://elsa.org/about/network/&lt;/ref&gt; across Europe with membership of some 50,000 students and young lawyers.&lt;ref&gt;https://elsa.org/#home&lt;/ref&gt;

ELSA-activities comprise a large variety of academic and professional events that are organised to fulfill the stated vision of ELSA and in order to provide its members opportunities to enhance their skills and to interact with each other.

==Organization==
ELSA is organized into local member groups active at university level (Local Group), national member groups active on a national level (National Group), and ELSA International active on an international level. 

Membership of ELSA for individual law students is possible through the Local Groups (for instance ELSA Leiden&lt;ref&gt;https://www.elsaleiden.nl/nl/&lt;/ref&gt;). The Local Groups are member of a National Group (for instance ELSA the Netherlands&lt;ref&gt;http://elsa-thenetherlands.org/&lt;/ref&gt;). The National Groups are part of the international ELSA network, which is managed by ELSA International with headquarters in [[Brussels]], [[Belgium]]. ELSA International consists of the International Board, the ELSA International Team, and the Auditors of ELSA.&lt;ref&gt;https://elsa.org/about/team/&lt;/ref&gt; 

The International Board is the supreme executive body of the association. Its members are elected at an International Council Meeting (ICM) (which consists of all the National Groups) for a one-year period. The International Board's responsibilities include the overall co-ordination of the organisation as a whole including the support of member groups both locally and nationally. The International Board also co-ordinates and develops ELSA's collaboration with various international organisations and institutions, governments, law firms, and companies across Europe.

==Identity==
ELSA's 350 university-based local groups and 44 national groups as well as the international board are entirely student-managed and administered. Similar to a small franchise, each group creates its own plan of operation in line with the overall goals of the association. Each group recruits and trains its volunteer executives and markets ELSA's programmes to the academic and business community. In combination with the university curriculum, ELSA prepares its members for their future entry into professional life, especially when working in an international environment. The philosophy of ELSA is defined by the following statements regarding its vision, purpose, and means&lt;ref&gt;https://elsa.org/about/&lt;/ref&gt;: 

''Vision:''&lt;br&gt;"A just world in which there is respect for human dignity and cultural diversity".

''Purpose:''&lt;br&gt;"To contribute to legal education, to foster mutual understanding and to promote social responsibility of law students and young lawyers".

''Means:''&lt;br&gt;
*Providing opportunities for law students and young lawyers to learn about other cultures and legal systems in a spirit of critical dialogue and scientific co-operation.
*Assisting law students and young lawyers to be internationally minded and professionally skilled.
*Encouraging law students and young lawyers to act for the good of society.

==Institutional relations==
ELSA has gained consultative status with several United Nations bodies. In 1994, ELSA was granted Consultative Status in Category C in [[UNESCO]] (United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization)&lt;ref&gt;https://en.unesco.org/partnerships/non-governmental-organizations/european-law-students-association&lt;/ref&gt;, and in 1997 ELSA obtained Special Consultative Status with [[ECOSOC]] (United Nations Economic and Social Council)&lt;ref&gt;See section II http://undocs.org/E/2016/INF/5&lt;/ref&gt;. In addition [[UNCITRAL]] (United Nations Commission on International Trade Law) is inviting ELSA delegations to participate in their sessions.{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}}

ELSA was part of the Diplomatic Conference of 1998 in [[Rome]] where the [[Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court]] was adopted to establish the [[International Criminal Court]]. ELSA participated with a delegation as an NGO represented by an observer.&lt;ref&gt;See Annex IV http://legal.un.org/icc/statute/finalfra.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2000, ELSA was granted Participatory Status with the [[Council of Europe]]&lt;ref&gt;http://coe-ngo.org/#/ingos&lt;/ref&gt;. This cooperation was further widened with the signing of a Human Rights Partnership between Council of Europe and ELSA in 2008&lt;ref&gt;https://www.coe.int/en/web/human-rights-channel/elsa&lt;/ref&gt;.

Furthermore, ELSA has a co-operation agreement with [[UNHCR]] (United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees).{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}} In October 2005, ELSA obtained Observer Status with [[WIPO]] (World Intellectual Property Organization)&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wipo.int/members/en/organizations.jsp?type=ngo_int&lt;/ref&gt;.

Since 2002, ELSA organizes the [[John H. Jackson Moot Court Competition]] (formerly known as ELSA Moot Court Competition) with the support of the WTO.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.wto.org/english/tratop_e/dispu_e/emc2_maps_e.htm&lt;/ref&gt; The final round is held at the WTO headquarters in [[Geneva]], [[Switzerland]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.wto.org/english/news_e/news17_e/disp_06jun17_e.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

==Activities==
ELSA's activities include the organization of:

*[[John H. Jackson Moot Court Competition]] (previously called ELSA Moot Court Competition) on WTO Law.
*Lectures, seminars, and conference (both local and international)
*Study visits
*Institutional visits
*[[Essay]] competitions
*[[Moot court|Moot courts]]
*Participation in international delegations (see [[European Law Students' Association#Delegations|Delegations]])
*[[Trainee|Traineeships]] for students 
*Trainings
*Intensive legal courses (ELSA Law Schools&lt;ref&gt;https://lawschools.elsa.org/about-law-schools/&lt;/ref&gt;)

==ELSA Network==
ELSA has members and observers in [[Albania]], [[Armenia]], [[Austria]], [[Azerbaijan]], [[Belarus]], [[Belgium]], [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], [[Bulgaria]], [[Croatia]], [[Cyprus]], [[Czech Republic]], [[Denmark]], [[Estonia]], [[Finland]], [[France]], [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], [[Germany]], [[Greece]], [[Hungary]], [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]], [[Italy]], [[Iceland]], [[Latvia]], [[Lithuania]], [[Luxembourg]], [[Republic of Macedonia|Macedonia]], [[Malta]], [[Moldova]], [[Montenegro]], the [[Netherlands]], [[Norway]], [[Poland]], [[Portugal]], [[Romania]], [[Russia]], [[Serbia]], [[Slovak Republic]], [[Slovenia]], [[Spain]], [[Sweden]], [[Switzerland]], [[Turkey]], [[Ukraine]] and the [[United Kingdom]].&lt;ref&gt;https://elsa.org/about/network/&lt;/ref&gt;

Furthermore, ELSA co-operates with other student organisations across the world, for instance the Asian Law Students' Association (ALSA) in Asia.&lt;ref&gt;http://alsainternational.org/elsa-3/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Publications==

'''Synergy'''&lt;br&gt;Synergy is a biannual publication that is printed in 10,000 copies and distributed throughout the network.&lt;ref&gt;https://elsa.org/synergy-magazine/&lt;/ref&gt; It contains articles written by members, academics and institutions. The magazine was first published as a newsletter back in 1987.

The '''France–Italy Maritime Boundary Agreement''' is a 1986 [[treaty]] between [[France]] and [[Italy]] which [[Boundary delimitation|delimits]] the [[maritime boundary]] between the two countries in the [[Strait of Bonifacio]].&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, Ewan W. (2003). ''International Boundaries: A Geopolitical Atlas,'' p.&amp;nbsp;419; Charney, Jonathan I. ''et al.'' (2005). ''International Maritime Boundaries,'' pp.&amp;nbsp;1571–1580.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Strait of Bonifacio separates the French island of [[Corsica]] from the Italian island of [[Sardinia]]. The treaty was signed in [[Paris]] on 28 November 1986. The [[border|boundary]] set out by the text of the treaty is a relatively short 40 [[nautical miles]] long and consists of five straight-line [[ocean|maritime]] segments defined by six individual coordinate points. The agreed-to boundary is an approximate equidistant line between the two islands.

The treaty came into force on 15 May 1989 after both countries had [[ratification|ratified]] it. The full name of the treaty is ''Agreement between the Government of the French Republic and the Government of the Italian Republic on the Delimitation of the Maritime Boundaries in the Area of the Strait of Bonifacio''.

'''Health law''' is the federal, state, and local law, rules, regulations and other jurisprudence among providers, payers and vendors to the health care industry and its patients; and (2) delivery of health care services; all with an emphasis on operations, regulatory and transactional legal issues.&lt;ref&gt;Definition of Health Law by the [http://www.tbls.org Texas Board of Legal Specialization]&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, The Florida Bar defines it as "legal issues involving federal, state, or local law, rules or regulations and health care provider issues, regulation of providers, legal issues regarding relationships between and among providers, legal issues regarding relationships between providers and payors, and legal issues regarding the delivery of health care services." &lt;ref&gt;https://www.floridabar.org/divexe/rrtfb.nsf/FV/78D3C48D7D2058B885256BC300493159&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="floridabar.org"&gt;https://www.floridabar.org/DIVCOM/PI/CertSect.nsf/9736b6935363096385256fd4005e5cea/4d9a883151e439a285256fd4005c0efe!OpenDocument&lt;/ref&gt; American University's college of law, in health law and policy, divides health law into 4 areas: health care law (focused on treatment), public and population health law (focused on prevention), bioethics, and global health law.

Health Law was first adopted as a separate legal specialty in which attorneys could become "board certified" and in which they could hold themselves out as a "legal specialist" or "legal expert" by The Florida Bar's Board of Legal Specialization in 1995.&lt;ref name="floridabar.org"/&gt; Later Texas adopted a similar program in 2002 modeling its program after Florida's.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tbls.org/WhyChooseBoardCertified.aspx|title=Why Choose Board Certified|author=|date=|website=www.tbls.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Becoming Board Certified in Health Law can be a challenging process, structured to allow only those attorneys who are most qualified in the area to become certified by the bar or licensing authority.&lt;ref&gt;For an example of Florida's requirements, see {{cite web|title=Florida Health Law Certification|url=https://www.floridabar.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/health-law-cert-flyer.pdf|website=Florida State Bar|accessdate=17 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One way in which an attorney in the United States can obtain additional education to practice health law or to use in becoming certified in the specialty of health law, is through one of the Master of Laws (LL.M.) programs that are offered by certain law schools. The LL.M. is considered to be a postgraduate law degree which shows a higher level of course work and study above the basic law degree (J.D. or B.S.L.). Some law schools with graduate law programs do offer a general LL.M. with a course emphasis on health law, global health law, public health law, forensic medicine or similar studies. Presently, twenty-five U.S. law schools offer health law programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Graduate Law Practice Areas - Health|url=http://www.nationaljurist.com/llm-programs/health|website=The National Jurist|publisher=Cypress Magazines|accessdate=17 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the U.S. particularly, medicine and the law are interconnected. The law intervenes to regulate the duty to treat, that essentially is ruled by contract law, which gives a doctor the right to refuse treatment, in the absence of an emergency, when no previous doctor patient relationship existed. However Doctors cannot discriminate because of disability, ADA, abandon a patient, or not render services in an emergency according to EMTALA (it aims doctors in emergency rooms, where they need to screen, stabilize and transfer.
It also regulates the fiduciary duties of doctor-patient, such as privacy HIPAA, informed consent (battery unlawful touch), conflict of interests, (Moore case) etc.

Medical malpractice is also an area where law and medicine are interconnected, which it relates to the standard of care, where custom similar locality rule may apply. There may be different schools of thought, where reputability is the issue at hand, and alternative theories that can be based on the hand formula.

There are other aspects of importance within the area of medical malpractice, such as causation, where medical probability and loss of chance are present. Damages, where the value of life and tort reforms appear to differ, and affirmative defenses, within the doctrine of informed consent, where waivers cannot suffice. There are rules such as the discovery rule that states that the statute of limitations starts to run when the injury has been discovered and not when it took place.

Some areas of law it includes are:
* [[Contract law]]
* [[Medical malpractice]]
* [[Medical law]]
* [[Administrative law]]
* [[Public health law]]
* [[Consent]]

==Basic terms==
The terms "[[legislation]]" and "[[law]]" are used to refer generically to statutes, regulation and other legal instruments (e.g. ministerial decrees) that may be the forms of law used in a particular country.

In general, there are a wide range of regulatory strategies that might be used to ensure people's [[health]] and safety. Increasingly, regulators are taking an approach of "responsive regulation". This involves using mechanisms that are responsive to the context, conduct and culture of those being regulated, providing for a range of regulatory mechanisms to achieve the behavior desired. Where appropriate, the aim is to use incentives before sanctions. However, when those being regulated do not respond accordingly, escalating sanctions can be invoked. These strategies may be broadly classified into five groups:

#voluntarism: voluntary compliance undertaken by an individual organization without any coercion;
#self-regulation : for example, an unorganized group that regulates the behavior of its own members through a voluntary code of practice;
#economic instruments: for example, supply funding sanctions or incentives for health care providers, and/or demand-side measures that give more power to consumers;
#meta-regulation: involving an external regulatory body to ensure that health care providers implement safety and quality practices and programs;
#command and control mechanisms : involving enforcement by government

'''Human Rights and Climate Change''' is a conceptual and legal framework under which international [[human rights]] and their relationship to [[global warming]] are studied, analyzed, and addressed. The framework has been employed by governments, [[United Nations]] organizations, [[Intergovernmental organization|intergovernmental]] and [[non-governmental organizations]], human rights and environmental advocates, and academics to guide national and international policy on climate change under the [[United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change]] (UNFCCC) and the core [[international human rights instruments]].
	
	Human rights and climate change analysis focuses on the anticipated consequences to humans associated with global environmental phenomena including [[sea level rise]], [[desertification]], temperature increases, extreme weather events, and changes in precipitation, as well as [[climate change adaptation|adaptation]] and [[climate change mitigation|mitigation]] measures taken by governments in response to those phenomena that may involve human rights or related legal protections.

==History==
In 2005, Inuit activist [[Sheila Watt-Cloutier]] filed a petition to the [[Inter-American Commission on Human Rights]] seeking relief "from human rights violations resulting from the impacts of global warming and climate change caused by acts and omissions of the United States."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Petition to the Inter American Commission on Human Rights Seeking Relief from Violations Resulting from Global Warming Caused by Acts and Omissions of the United States|date=7 December 2005|url=http://www.inuitcircumpolar.com/files/uploads/icc-files/FINALPetitionICC.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The petition was rejected, but the Commission invited and heard testimony on the relationship between human rights and climate change from representatives for the Inuit in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Sieg|first=Richard|title=At International Commission, Inuit Want to See Change in U.S. Policy on Global Warming|url=http://www.vjel.org/news/NEWS100058.html|accessdate=25 April 2012|date=2 March 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

That same year, the Malé Declaration on the Human Dimension of Global Climate Change "stated explicitly (and for the first time in an international agreement) that 'climate change has clear and immediate implications for the full enjoyment of human rights' and called on the United Nations human rights system to address the issue as a matter of urgency."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Limon|first=Marc|title=HUMAN RIGHTS AND CLIMATE CHANGE: CONSTRUCTING A CASE FOR POLITICAL ACTION|journal=Harvard Environmental Law Review|year=2009|volume=33|issue=2|pages=439–476|url=http://www.law.harvard.edu/students/orgs/elr/vol33_2/Limon.pdf|accessdate=25 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Malé Declaration on the Human Dimension of Global Climate Change|date=14 November 2007|url=http://www.ciel.org/Publications/Male_Declaration_Nov07.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The following year, the [[United Nations Human Rights Council#Climate change|UN Human Rights Council]] (HRC) unanimously adopted Resolution 7/23, recognizing that "climate change poses an immediate and far-reaching threat to people and communities around the world and has implications for the full enjoyment of human rights," and citing the [[Charter of the United Nations]], the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]], the [[International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights]], and the [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=HRC|title=UNHRC Resolution 7/23, Human rights and climate change|date=28 March 2008|url=http://ap.ohchr.org/documents/E/HRC/resolutions/A_HRC_RES_7_23.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The HRC reaffirmed and expanded these statements with resolutions 10/4 of 25 March 2009&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=HRC|title=UNHRC Resolution 10/4, Human rights and climate change|date=25 March 2009|url=http://ap.ohchr.org/documents/E/HRC/resolutions/A_HRC_RES_10_4.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and 18/22 of 30 September 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=HRC|title=A/HRC/RES/18/22 Human rights and climate change|date=30 September 2011|url=http://daccess-ods.un.org/TMP/6246410.01224518.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, the [[Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights]] (OHCHR) released an analytical study identifying specific rights and people groups likely to be adversely affected by climate disruptions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=OHCHR|title=Report of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights on the relationship between climate change and human rights|date=15 January 2009|issue=A/HRC/10/61|url=http://daccess-dds-ny.un.org/doc/UNDOC/GEN/G09/103/44/PDF/G0910344.pdf?OpenElement}}&lt;/ref&gt; The report drew on the submissions of some 30 nations as well as ten [[List of specialized agencies of the United Nations|United Nations Agencies]] and dozens of other organizations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=OHCHR|title=OHCHR study on the relationship between climate change and human rights: Submissions and reference documents received|url=http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Issues/HRAndClimateChange/Pages/Submissions.aspx|accessdate=25 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The report identified displaced persons, conflict and security risks as well as impaired rights of indigenous peoples, women, and children as major concerns.&lt;ref&gt;''See'' {{cite journal|title=Report|url=http://daccess-dds-ny.un.org/doc/UNDOC/GEN/G09/103/44/PDF/G0910344.pdf?OpenElement}}, n.8, at 15-22.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, the [[United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change#Annex I, Annex II countries and developing countries|Conference of Parties to the UNFCCC]] reproduced the HRC's language identifying the relationship between human rights and climate change in its report on the [[2010 United Nations Climate Change Conference]] in [[Cancun]], Mexico.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Conference of the Parties|title=FCCC/CP/2010/7/Add.1, Report of the Conference of the Parties on its sixteenth session, held in Cancun from 29 November to 10 December 2010, Addendum, Part Two: Action taken by the Conference of the Parties at its sixteenth session|date=15 March 2011|url=http://unfccc.int/resource/docs/2010/cop16/eng/07a01.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The report on the outcome of the Conference emphasized that "Parties should, in all climate change related actions, fully respect human rights."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=''Id.''|journal=Decision 1/CP.16, The Cancun Agreements:  Outcome of the work of the Ad Hoc Working Group on Long-term Cooperative Action under the Convention|date=15 March 2011|url=http://unfccc.int/resource/docs/2010/cop16/eng/07a01.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Recent years have seen an increased recognition of the link between human rights and the environment, yet there are still many questions surrounding the relationship between them. As a result, in 2012 the HRC established a mandate on human rights obligations relating to the enjoyment of a safe, clean, healthy and sustainable environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=HRC|title=UNHRC Resolution 19/10, Human rights and the environment|date=19 April 2012|url=https://documents-dds-ny.un.org/doc/RESOLUTION/GEN/G12/131/59/PDF/G1213159.pdf?OpenElement}}&lt;/ref&gt; A preliminary report by the appointed Independent Expert, John H. Knox, further stated that there needed to be priority in providing greater conceptual clarity to the application of human rights obligations related to the environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=UNHRC|title=Report of the Independent Expert on the issue of human rights obligations relating to the enjoyment of a safe, clean, healthy and sustainable environment|date=24 December 2012|issue=A/HRC/22/43|url=http://www.ohchr.org/Documents/HRBodies/HRCouncil/RegularSession/Session22/A-HRC-22-43_en.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, all 78 of the United Nations Special Procedures Mandate Holders issued a joint statement on [[Human Rights Day]] calling for states to incorporate their existing obligations under the human rights framework into climate change negotiations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=15393&amp;|title=OHCHR {{!}} Statement of the United Nations Special Procedures Mandate Holders on the occasion of the Human Rights Day Geneva, 10 December 2014|website=www.ohchr.org|language=en-US|access-date=2017-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; This would have the effect of bringing the rights of those affected by climate change to the forefront of all response strategies. 

As of March 2015, there is now a [[United Nations special rapporteur|Special Rapporteur]] on human rights and the environment, an extension of the mandate of the former Independent Expert on human rights obligations relating to the enjoyment of a safe, clean, healthy and sustainable environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=HRC|title=UNHRC Resolution 28/11, Human rights and the environment|date=7 April 2015|url=https://documents-dds-ny.un.org/doc/UNDOC/GEN/G15/071/78/PDF/G1507178.pdf?OpenElement}}&lt;/ref&gt; Leading up to the [[2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference]] in Paris, the Special Rapporteur informed states that they should ensure their human rights obligations encompass the appropriate perspective towards climate change when negotiating future agreements.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=16836&amp;LangID=E|title=OHCHR {{!}} COP21: "States’ human rights obligations encompass climate change" – UN expert|website=www.ohchr.org|language=en-US|access-date=2017-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Paris Agreement''', as adopted on the 12 December 2015 at the Conference of the Parties, is the most important indication of increasing awareness towards the relationship between climate change and human rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=UNHRC|title=Report of the Special Rapporteur on the issue of human rights obligations relating to the enjoyment of a safe, clean, healthy and sustainable environment|date=1 February 2016|issue=A/HRC/31/52|url=https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2729611}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Paris Agreement is the first climate agreement to recognise the relevance of human rights, stating:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=UNFCCC|date=12 December 2015|title=Adoption of the Paris Agreement|url=https://unfccc.int/resource/docs/2015/cop21/eng/l09r01.pdf|issue=FCCC/CP/2015/L.9/Rev.1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Parties should, when taking action to address climate change, respect, promote and consider their respective obligations on human rights, the right to health, the rights of indigenous peoples, local communities, migrants, children, persons with disabilities and people in vulnerable situations and the right to development, as well as gender equality, empowerment of women and intergenerational equity.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Human rights law and climate change ==
Climate change is inducing not only ecological adjustments, but is also impacting the social, economic, political, cultural and legal aspects of societies around the world. The HRC has affirmed that human rights obligations have the ability to strengthen both international and national policy-making in the area of climate change.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=HRC|title=UNHRC Resolution 10/4, Human rights and climate change|date=25 March 2009|url=http://ap.ohchr.org/documents/E/HRC/resolutions/A_HRC_RES_10_4.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 1972 [[United Nations Conference on the Human Environment|Stockholm Declaration]] provided the basis for further elaboration of a human right to environmental quality.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/271647969|title=International law and the environment|last=W.|first=Birnie, Patricia|date=2009|publisher=Oxford University Press|others=Boyle, Alan E., Redgwell, Catherine.|isbn=9780198764229|edition=3rd|location=Oxford|oclc=271647969}}&lt;/ref&gt; Environmental protection is not commonly included in human rights treaties. Rather environmental protection is derived from the rights that those treaties protect, such as the rights to life, food and water and health.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/724352139|title=Human rights and climate change : a review of the international legal dimensions.|last=1974-|first=McInerney-Lankford, Siobhán Alice,|date=2011|publisher=World Bank|others=Darrow, Mac., Rajamani, Lavanya., World Bank.|isbn=9780821387207|location=Washington, D.C.|oclc=724352139}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moving forward, human rights law in the context of climate change policy-making may help to establish minimum standards of basic human rights that can be adopted in international and national mitigation and adaption measures.

==Rights implicated==
	Most international statements on human rights and climate change have emphasized the potential adverse impacts of climate change on the rights to [[right to life|life]], [[right to food|food]], [[right to water|water]], [[right to health|health]], [[right to housing|housing]], [[right to development|development]], and [[right to self-determination|self-determination]].&lt;ref&gt;''See'' Malé Declaration, n.4; UNHRC Resolution 18/22, n.7; A/HRC/10/61, n.8; FCCC/CP/2010/7/Add.1, n.10.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Human rights, climate change and cross-border displacement|url = http://www.universal-rights.org/urg-policy-reports/human-rights-climate-change-and-cross-border-displacement-the-role-of-the-international-human-rights-community-in-contributing-to-effective-and-just-solutions/|website = Universal Rights Group|access-date = 2016-02-10|language = en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; These rights are enumerated in the core conventions of [[international human rights law]], though not all HRC members or UNFCCC parties are signatories of these conventions.

=== Right to life ===
The right to life is protected by Article 6 of the ICCPR where every human being has the inherent right to life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=OHCRC|title=International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights|date=23 March 1976|url=http://www.ohchr.org/Documents/ProfessionalInterest/ccpr.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The right to life is inextricably linked to the measure of fulfilment of other rights. There are both projected and observed effects that climate change will have on the right to life. The [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]] ('''IPCC''') [[IPCC Fourth Assessment Report|fourth assessment report]] projected an increase in people suffering from death and injury occurring from an increase in floods, storms, heatwaves, fires and droughts.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal|last=UNHRC|title=Report of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights on the relationship between climate change and human rights|date=15 January 2009|issue=A/HRC/10/61|url=http://www.ohchr.org/Documents/Press/AnalyticalStudy.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Climate change will equally affect the right to life through an increase in hunger and malnutrition and related disorder impacting child growth and development, respiratory morbidity and ground-level ozone.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Rising sea levels is one of the flow-on effects of climate change, resulting from warming water and melting ice sheets.

Observed effects are those where the right to life has already inhibited the right to life.

=== Right to food ===
This is derived from Article II of the ICESCR where States party to the Covenant have to maximise their available resources to the achieve the right to adequate food.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights|1966}}: article 2(1), 11(1) and 23.&lt;/ref&gt; Climate change is going to affect all four pillars of [[food security]]; availability, access, utilization and stability. A 2008 report by the Special Rapporteur on the right to food has stated that the way the world grows food will have to undergo radical change to cope with a growing population and the effects of climate change, while avoiding environmental collapse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=De Schutter|first=Olivier|title=Report of the Special Rapporteur on the right to food, Building resilience: a human rights framework for world food and nutrition security |date=8 September 2008|issue=A/HRC/9/23|url=http://www2.ohchr.org/english/issues/food/docs/A.HRC.9.23.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Paris Agreement recognises the fundamental priority of ensuring food security and the particular vulnerabilities of food production systems to the adverse impacts of climate change.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Article 2 calls for adaption to the adverse impacts of climate change and the lowering of greenhouse gas emissions in a manner that will not threaten food production.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The IPCC fourth assessment report projects that food production will increase in the mid to high latitudes with a temperature increase of between 1° and 3&amp;nbsp;°C, however at lower latitudes crop productivity is set to decrease which increases the risk of food insecurity in poorer regions of the world.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The [[United Nations Development Programme]] estimate an additional 600 million people will face malnutrition due to climate change.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=UNDP|first=|date=2007|title=Fighting climate change: Human solidarity in a divided world|url=http://www.undp.org/content/dam/undp/library/corporate/HDR/2006%20Global%20HDR/HDR-2006-Beyond%20scarcity-Power-poverty-and-the-global-water-crisis.pdf|journal=Human Development Report|volume=|pages=8|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is likely to have a particularly devastating effect on Sub-Saharan Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=IPCC|title=Working Group II Report|date=2007|issue=AR4|url=https://www.ipcc.ch/pdf/assessment-report/ar4/wg2/ar4_wg2_full_report.pdf|pages=275|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Right to water ===
The [[Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights]] ('''CESCR''') notes that the right to water is not only an essential condition to survival, but also that it is inextricably linked with other rights, such as; [[right to housing|housing]], [[right to health|attainable standard of health]], [[right to an adequate standard of living|adequate standard of living]], and [[right to food]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=CESCR|title=General Comment No. 15: The Right to Water (Arts. 11 and 12 of the Covenant)  |date=20 January 2003|issue=E/C.12/2002/11|url=http://www.refworld.org/pdfid/4538838d11.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Stern Review]] states that people will feel the effects of climate change the most strongly through changes in patterns of water distribution around the globe.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=2006-12-01|title=The Stern Review on the Economic Effects of Climate Change|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1728-4457.2006.00153.x/abstract|journal=Population and Development Review|language=en|volume=32|issue=4|pages=|doi=10.1111/j.1728-4457.2006.00153.x|issn=1728-4457|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Those areas that are already experiencing dry conditions will experience a further decrease in water availability, with several (but not all) climate models predicting up to a 30 per cent decrease in annual run-off in the Mediterranean Basin, parts of southern Africa and South America for a 2&amp;nbsp;°C global temperature rise, and 40 – 50 per cent for 4&amp;nbsp;°C rise.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/652432164|title=Human rights and climate change|last=|first=|date=2010|publisher=Cambridge University Press|others=Humphreys, Stephen.|year=|isbn=9780521762762|location=Cambridge|pages=|oclc=652432164}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[IPCC Fifth Assessment Report|IPCC fifth assessment report]] states that freshwater-related risks increase significantly with increasing greenhouse gas concentrations, with climate change over the 21st century projected to reduce renewable surface water and groundwater resources significantly in most dry subtropical regions.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=IPCC|first=|date=2014|title=IPCC Fifth Assessment Report|url=https://www.ipcc.ch/pdf/assessment-report/ar5/syr/SYR_AR5_FINAL_full_wcover.pdf|journal=|volume=AR5|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Right to health ===
Article 12 of the '''ICESCR''' identifies the "right to the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights|1966}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most national constitutions protect the right to health in some manner, and it is widely safeguarded in other international and regional instruments.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Human Rights and Climate Change : A Review of the International Legal Dimensions|last1=McInerney-Lankford|first1=Siobhan|last2=Darrow|first2=Mac|last3=Rajamani|first3=Lavanya|publisher=World Bank Publications|year=2011|isbn=9780821387207|location=|pages=|at=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Climate change is going to amplify health disparities between the rich and poor in different parts of the world. The [[World Health Organization|World Health Organisation]] ('''WHO''') estimates that since 1970, climate change is responsible for 150,000 deaths every year through increasing incidence in the spread of diarrhoea, malaria and malnutrition predominantly in Africa and other developing regions.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Just a 1&amp;nbsp;°C increase in global temperature from pre-industrial levels could double the annual deaths from climate change (according to WHO).&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

==Specific issues==

===Displacement===
Potential climate induced migration is currently one of the most disputed flow-on effects from climate change. Research suggests that climate change may create some 50 to 200 million new [[internally displaced persons]] and international [[refugees]] by the year 2100.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Docherty|first=Bonnie|author2=Tyler Giannini|title=Confronting a Rising Tide: A Proposal for a Convention on Climage Change Refugees|journal=Harvard Environmental Law Review|year=2009|volume=33|pages=349–403|url=http://www.law.harvard.edu/students/orgs/elr/vol33_2/Docherty%20Giannini.pdf|accessdate=25 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Mega-deltas" in Asia, Africa, and small islands are at high risk of floods and storms, which will cause large-scale displacement of the local populations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.brookings.edu/research/displacement-caused-by-the-effects-of-climate-change-who-will-be-affected-and-what-are-the-gaps-in-the-normative-framework-for-their-protection/|title=Displacement Caused by the Effects of Climate Change: Who Will Be Affected and What Are the Gaps in the Normative Framework for Their Protection? {{!}} Brookings Institution|date=2017-02-16|newspaper=Brookings|access-date=2017-02-16|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Climate change induced migration will either affect or violate basic international human right norms.

=== Climate justice ===
There is significant discussion around the concept of climate justice for the [[environmental migrant]] or 'climate refugee'. This concept aims to fill a gap in the legal and political sectors for the millions of people that are not able to receive international legal protection as this source of migration is yet to be included in regional and international law.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/987699915|title=Climate change, migration and human rights law and policy perspectives|others=Manou, Dimitra,, Baldwin, Andrew, 1970-, Cubie, Dug,, Mihr, Anja, 1969-, Thorp, Teresa M., 1968-|isbn=9781317222330|location=London|oclc=987699915}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is currently no established definition for who can be classified as a climate refugee because it has not yet been enshrined in international law. In 2014 Siego Alesana left the [[Small Island Developing States|small island developing state]] of [[Tuvalu]] because of the uncertainty surrounding the adverse effects of climate change.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Citation|title=AD (Tuvalu )|date=4 June 2014|url=http://www.nzlii.org/cgi-bin/sinodisp/nz/cases/NZIPT/2014/501370.html?query=AD%20(Tuvalu)|issue=501370|accessdate=2017-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tuvalu is only 4.6m above sea level and faces the imminent danger posed by rising sea levels. Although the impacts of climate change were put forward on behalf of Alesana and his family, the case rested largely on humanitarian grounds. However the [[Immigration and Protection Tribunal]] did state that environmental degradation caused by climate change was already a feature of life in Tuvalu.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; Although this decision wasn't based on impacts of climate change that is not to say that climate change related factors weren't taken into consideration at all.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.vernonrive.com/home/climate-refugees-revisited-a-closer-look-at-the-tuvalu-decision|title="Climate refugees" revisited: a closer look at the Tuvalu decision|website=Vernon Rive|access-date=2017-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[International Organization for Migration]] has put forward a working definition of environmental migrant:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.iom.int/definitional-issues|title=Definitional Issues|date=2015-01-29|work=International Organization for Migration|access-date=2017-09-09|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt;Environmental migrants are persons or groups of persons who, predominantly for reasons of sudden or progressive change in the environment that adversely affects their lives or living conditions, are obliged to leave their habitual homes, or choose to do so, either temporarily or permanently, and who move within their country or abroad.&lt;/blockquote&gt;Until there is a legally binding definition of what constitutes an environmental migrant, it will be difficult for any true justice to be served. The concept of climate justice would see all human rights implemented in the most transparent way in order to maintain basic standards in the face of the somewhat unknown impacts that will be created by climate change.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

===Conflict===
International peacebuilding NGO [[International Alert]] names 46 countries where climate change effects (including water scarcity, loss of arable land, extreme weather events, shortened growing seasons, and melting glaciers) may interact with economic, social, and political forces to create "a high risk of violent conflict."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Smith|first=Dan|author2=Janani Vivekananda|title=A CLIMATE OF CONFLICT: The links between climate change, peace and war|journal=International Alert|date=November 2007|url=http://www.international-alert.org/sites/default/files/publications/A_climate_of_conflict.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Indigenous peoples===
[[Indigenous peoples]] have a unique position when it comes to discussion of the impacts climate change will have on a population. Many indigenous populations live subsistence lifestyles, which in turn are disrupted severely when it comes to the impact of climate change. In many countries, municipal law differs in application to indigenous peoples than the rest of the population which complicates any legal remedy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/811732784|title=Climate change and Indigenous peoples : the search for legal remedies|date=2013|publisher=Edward Elgar|others=Abate, Randall., Kronk, Elizabeth Ann.|isbn=9781783474172|location=Cheltenham, UK|oclc=811732784}}&lt;/ref&gt; Climate change impacts indigenous peoples differently not only because of their physical and spiritual connections to the land and water, but also because they have a specialised ecological and traditional knowledge that can be used to find the best mitigation strategy of those effects.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gerrard|first=Emily|date=2008|title=Climate change and human rights : issues and opportunities for Indigenous peoples|url=|journal=University of New South Wales Law Journal|volume=31|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

UN Human Rights organs have identified the [[rights of indigenous peoples]] as particularly vulnerable to the disruptive effects of climate change.&lt;ref&gt;OHCHR: Climate change and indigenous peoples, http://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/ClimateChangeIP.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hampson|first=Françoise|title=THE HUMAN RIGHTS SITUATION OF INDIGENOUS PEOPLES IN STATES AND TERRITORIES THREATENED WITH EXTINCTION FOR ENVIRONMENTAL REASONS|date=13 July 2004|issue=E/CN.4/Sub.2/AC.4/2004/CRP.1|url=http://www.ohchr.org/Documents/Issues/IPeoples/WG/crp1.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to climate change, indigenous people have been threatened with their livelihood and cultural idententies across the world North America, Europe, Latin America, Africa, Asia and the Pacific. Approximately 370 million indigenous people are affected.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Williams|first=Jay|date=2012-05-01|title=The impact of climate change on indigenous people – the implications for the cultural, spiritual, economic and legal rights of indigenous people|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/13642987.2011.632135|journal=The International Journal of Human Rights|volume=16|issue=4|pages=648–688|doi=10.1080/13642987.2011.632135|issn=1364-2987}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Child Rights===
Researchers at the [[Overseas Development Institute]] identified that children in South Asia may be particularly vulnerable to violations of human rights following climate related disasters. These can include gender-based violence, child labour, family break-ups and barriers to their development and learning. The researchers argue that [[child rights]] are rarely prioritised in policies to reduce disaster risk or adapt to climate change and that [[climate change adaptation]] policies must tailor interventions to address critical aspects of child rights, particularly child protection and education.&lt;ref&gt;Katie Harris and Kelly Hawrylyshyn, Climate extremes and child rights in South Asia: a neglected priority, http://www.odi.org.uk/sites/odi.org.uk/files/odi-assets/publications-opinion-files/7832.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

===Development===
Given that many of the world's poorest citizens depend directly on the environment for all or part of their daily livelihoods, many international development agencies see climate change and development as "inextricably linked."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=U.S. Agency for International Development|title=Integrating Climate Change into Development|date=November 2008|url=http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDACM036.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=The International Bank for Reconstruction and Development|author2=The World Bank|title=DEVELOPMENT AND CLIMATE CHANGE A Strategic Framework for the World Bank Group|year=2008|url=http://siteresources.worldbank.org/EXTCC/Resources/407863-1219339233881/DCCSFTechnicalReport.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Khoday|first=Kishan|title=Climate Change and the Right to Development.

{{International relations theory sidebar|liberalism}}
'''Idealism''' in foreign policy holds that a state should make its internal political [[philosophy]] the goal of its foreign policy.  For example, an idealist might believe that ending poverty at home should be coupled with tackling poverty abroad. U.S. President [[Woodrow Wilson]] was an early advocate of idealism. Wilson's idealism was a precursor to [[liberal international relations theory]], which would arise amongst the "institution-builders" after [[World War II]]. It particularly emphasized the ideal of [[American exceptionalism]].

More generally, [[Michael W. Doyle]] describes idealism as based on the belief that other nations' stated good intentions can be relied on, whereas Realism holds that good intentions are in the long run subject to the [[security dilemma]] described by [[John H. Herz]].

[[Hedley Bull]] wrote:&lt;ref&gt;Quoted from [[Donald Markwell]], ''[[John Maynard Keynes]] and International Relations: Economic Paths to War and Peace'', Oxford University Press, 2006, page 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|By the 'idealists' we have in mind writers such as Sir [[Alfred Zimmern]], S. H. Bailey, [[Philip Noel-Baker]], and David Mitrany in the United Kingdom, and James T. Shotwell, Pitman Potter, and Parker T. Moon in the United States. ... The distinctive characteristic of these writers was their belief in progress: the belief, in particular, that the system of international relations that had given rise to the First World War was capable of being transformed into a fundamentally more peaceful and just world order; that under the impact of the awakening of democracy, the growth of 'the international mind', the development of the League of Nations, the good works of men of peace or the enlightenment spread by their own teaching, it was in fact being transformed; and that their responsibility as students of international relations was to assist this march of progress to overcome the ignorance, the prejudices, the ill-will, and the sinister interests that stood in its way.}}

==History==
[[File:Ww28.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Official White House portrait of Woodrow Wilson]]
Since the 1880s, there has been growing study of the major writers of this idealist tradition of thought in international relations, including Sir [[Alfred Zimmern]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Donald Markwell]] (1986), 'Sir Alfred Zimmern Revisited: Fifty Years On', Review of International Studies. [[Donald Markwell]], 'Sir Alfred Eckhard Zimmern', Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Norman Angell]], [[John Maynard Keynes]],&lt;ref&gt;E.g. [[Donald Markwell]], ''John Maynard Keynes and International Relations: Economic Paths to War and Peace'', Oxford University Press,2006,7.&lt;/ref&gt; [[John A. Hobson]], [[Leonard Woolf]], [[Gilbert Murray]], [[Florence Stawell]] (known as Melian Stawell), [[Philip Henry Kerr, 11th Marquess of Lothian]], [[Arnold J. Toynbee]], [[Lester Pearson]] and [[David Davies, 1st Baron Davies|David Davies]].

Much of this writing has contrasted these idealist writers with '[[Realism (international relations)|realists]]' in the tradition of [[E. H. Carr]], whose ''The Twenty Years' Crisis'' (1939) both coined the term 'idealist' and was a fierce and effective assault on the inter-war idealists.
Idealism is centered on the notion that states are rational actors capable of ensuring lasting peace and security rather than resorting to war.

Idealism is also marked by the prominent role played by [[international law]] and [[international organizations]] in its conception of policy formation.  One of the most well-known tenets of modern idealist thinking is [[democratic peace theory]], which holds that states with similar modes of democratic governance do not fight one another.  Wilson's idealistic thought was embodied in his [[Fourteen points]] speech, and in the creation of the [[League of Nations]].

Idealism transcends the [[Left-wing politics|left]]-[[Right-wing politics|right]] political spectrum.  Idealists can include both [[human rights]] campaigners (traditionally, but not always, associated with the left) and [[Neoconservatism in the United States|American neoconservatism]] which is usually associated with the right.

Idealism may find itself in opposition to [[Realism (international relations)|Realism]], a [[worldview]] which argues that a nation's [[national interest]] is more important than [[ethics|ethical]] or [[Morality|moral]] considerations; however, there need be no conflict between the two (see [[Neoconservatism]] for an example of a confluence of the two). Realist thinkers include [[Hans Morgenthau]], [[Niccolò Machiavelli]], [[Otto von Bismarck]], [[George F. Kennan]] and others. Recent practitioners of Idealism in the United States have included [[Ronald Reagan]] and [[George W. Bush]].&lt;ref name="fl100204"&gt;{{Cite news | first=Michael | last=Gerson | title=Syndicated column:Realism and regime change - US solidarity could aid Iran's Green Revolution| url=http://townhall.com/columnists/MichaelGerson/2010/02/03/realism_and_regime_change_in_iran| work= | publisher=Florida Today | location=Melbourne, Florida | pages= 11A | date=4 February 2010 | id= | accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!---reference is internally consistent with print version but not online version---&gt;

Link finds that Wilson from his earliest days had imbibed the beliefs of his denomination - in the omnipotence of God, the morality of the Universe, a system of rewards and punishments and the notion that nations, as well as man, transgressed the laws of God at their peril.&lt;ref&gt;Arthur S. Link, "A Portrait of Wilson," ''Virginia Quarterly Review''1956 32(4): 524-541&lt;/ref&gt; Blum (1956) argues that  he learned from [[William Ewart Gladstone]] a mystic conviction in the superiority of Anglo-Saxons, in their righteous duty to make the world over in their image. Moral principle, constitutionalism, and faith in God were among the prerequisites for alleviating human strife. While he interpreted international law within such a brittle, moral cast, Wilson remained remarkably insensitive to new and changing social forces and conditions of the 20th century. He expected too much justice in a morally brutal world which disregarded the self-righteous resolutions of parliaments and statesmen like himself. Wilson's triumph was as a teacher of international morality to generations yet unborn.&lt;ref&gt;John Morton Blum, ''Woodrow Wilson and the Politics of Morality'' (1956), pp. 10, 197-99&lt;/ref&gt; [[Daniel Patrick Moynihan]] sees Wilson's vision of world order anticipated humanity prevailing through the "Holy Ghost of Reason," a vision which rested on religious faith.&lt;ref&gt;David Steigerwald, ''Wilsonian Idealism in America'' (1994), 230&lt;/ref&gt;

Wilson's diplomatic policies had a profound influence on shaping the world. Diplomatic historian [[Walter Russell Mead]] has explained:&lt;ref&gt;Walter Russell Mead, [http://www.randomhouse.com/knopf/authors/mead/excerpt.html ''Special Providence''], (2001)&lt;/ref&gt;

Wilson's views were based on the future welfare of humankind. He called for a world made safe democracy, this was organized around     political, economic and social standards. These principles were stated in his [[Fourteen Points|14- point peace program]]. Wilson thought of this program as an American commitment to show man kind the way of liberty. The core of Wilson's program was a [[League of Nations|league of nations]] committed to peace, and bringing down tyranny which was thought to be the root of war. The idea was that if democracy could be widespread peace and prosperity              would prevail.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The World Transformed|last=Michael|first=Hunt|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2004|isbn=978-0-19-937102-0|location=New York|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:Wilson's principles survived the eclipse of the Versailles system and they still guide European politics today: self-determination, democratic government, collective security, international law, and a league of nations. Wilson may not have gotten everything he wanted at [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919|Versailles]], and his treaty was never ratified by the Senate, but his vision and his diplomacy, for better or worse, set the tone for the twentieth century. [[French Third Republic|France]], [[German Empire|Germany]], [[Kingdom of Italy (1861–1946)|Italy]], and [[United Kingdom|Britain]] may have sneered at Wilson, but every one of these powers today conducts its European policy along Wilsonian lines. What was once dismissed as visionary is now accepted as fundamental. This was no mean achievement, and no European statesman of the twentieth century has had as lasting, as benign, or as widespread an influence.

American foreign relations since 1914 have rested on Wilsonian idealism, says historian David Kennedy, even if adjusted somewhat by the "realism" represented by [[Franklin Delano Roosevelt]] and [[Henry Kissinger]]. Kennedy argues that every president since Wilson has "embraced the core precepts of [[Wilsonianism]]. Nixon himself hung Wilson's portrait in the White House Cabinet Room. Wilson's ideas continue to dominate American foreign policy in the twenty-first century. In the aftermath of 9/11 they have, if anything, taken on even greater vitality."&lt;ref&gt;David M. Kennedy, "What 'W' Owes to 'WW': President Bush May Not Even Know It, but He Can Trace His View of the World to Woodrow Wilson, Who Defined a Diplomatic Destiny for America That We Can't Escape", ''The Atlantic Monthly'' Vol: 295. Issue: 2. (March 2005) pp 36ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Descendant theories ==

Idealism proper was a relatively short-lived school of thought, and suffered a crisis of confidence following the failure of the League of Nations and the outbreak of [[World War II]].  However, subsequent theories of international relations would draw elements from Wilsonian Idealism when constructing their world views.

=== Liberalism ===
{{main|Liberal international relations theory}}

Liberalism manifested a tempered version of Wilson's idealism in the wake of World War II.  Cognizant of the failures of Idealism to prevent renewed [[isolationism]] following World War II, and its inability to manage the [[balance of power in international relations|balance of power]] in Europe to prevent the outbreak of a new war, liberal thinkers devised a set of international institutions based on rule of law and regularized interaction.  These international organizations, such as the [[United Nations]]  and the [[NATO]], or even international regimes such as the [[Bretton Woods system]], and [[General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade]] (GATT), were calculated both to maintain a balance of power as well as regularize cooperation between nations.

=== Neoconservatism ===
{{main|Neoconservatism}}

Neoconservatism drew from Liberalism its intense focus on the promotion of "[[universal value]]s", in this case [[democracy]], [[human rights]], [[free trade]], [[women's rights]] and [[minority group|minority]] protections. However, it differs in that it is less wedded to the importance of preserving international institutions and treaties while pursuing assertive or aggressive stances which it deems morally worthy, and is willing to use force or the threat of force, unilaterally if necessary, to push for its goals.

The '''Indian Reorganization Act''' of June 18, 1934, or the '''Wheeler-Howard Act''', was U.S. federal legislation that dealt with the status of Native Americans in the United States.  It was the centerpiece of what has been often called the "'''Indian [[New Deal]]'''".  The major goal was to reverse the traditional goal of assimilation of Indians into American society and to strengthen, encourage and perpetuate the tribes and their historic traditions and culture.

The Act also restored to Indians the management of their assets—land and mineral rights—and included provisions intended to create a sound economic foundation for the inhabitants of [[Indian reservation]]s.  The law did not apply to Hawaii; Alaska and Oklahoma were added under another law in 1936. (American Indian tribes in Oklahoma had their land allotted and land title extinguished, so did not have any reservations left.) The census counted 332,000 Indians in 1930 and 334,000 in 1940, including those on and off reservations in the 48 states. Total spending on Indians averaged $38 million a year in the late 1920s, dropping to an all time low of $23 million in 1933, and reaching $38 million in 1940.&lt;ref&gt;US Bureau of the Census, ''Statistical Abstract of the United States: 1951'' (1951) pp 14, 306&lt;/ref&gt;

The IRA was the most significant initiative of [[John Collier (sociologist)|John Collier]], who was President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]]'s Commissioner of the [[Bureau of Indian Affairs]] (BIA) from 1933 to 1945. He had long studied Indian issues and worked for change since the 1920s, particularly with the [[American Indian Defense Association]].  He intended to reverse the assimilationist policies that had resulted in considerable damage to Native American cultures, and to provide a means for American Indians to re-establish sovereignty and self-government, to reduce the losses of reservation lands, and to build economic self-sufficiency. He believed that Indian traditional culture was superior to that of modern America, and thought it worthy of emulation. His proposals were considered highly controversial, as numerous powerful interests had profited from the sale and management of Native lands. Congress revised Collier's proposals and preserved oversight of tribes and reservations by the Bureau of Indian Affairs within the Department of Interior.

The self-government provisions would automatically go into effect for a tribe unless a clear majority of the eligible Indians voted it down. When approved, a tribe would adopt a variation of the model constitution drafted by BIA lawyers.

==History==

===Background===
At the time the Act passed, it was United States policy to eliminate Indian reservations, dividing the communal territory and allotting 160-acre plots to individual heads of households, to be owned in severalty. Before allotment, reservation territory was not owned in the usual European-American sense, but was reserved for the benefit of entire Indian tribes. The communal benefits were apportioned to tribe members according to tribal law and custom.  Generally, Indians held the land in a communal fashion. Non-Indians were not allowed to own land on reservations, a fact which limited the value of the land to the Indians. (It reduced the market for it).

The process of allotment started with the [[Dawes Act|General Allotment Act]] of 1887. By 1934, two thirds of Indian land had converted to traditional private ownership (i.e. it was owned in fee simple). Most of that had been sold by  Indian allottees, often because they had no means to pay local taxes on the lands, for which they were newly responsible. The IRA provided a mechanism for the recovery of land that had been sold—including land that had been sold to tribal Indians. They would lose individual property under the law.

John Collier was appointed Commissioner of the Indian Bureau (it is now called the [[Bureau of Indian Affairs]], BIA) in April 1933 by President [[Franklin Delano Roosevelt]]. He had the full support of his boss, Secretary of the Interior [[Harold L. Ickes]], who was also an expert on Indian issues.&lt;ref&gt;T. H. Watkins, ''Righteous Pilgrim: The Life and Times of Harold L. Ickes, 1874-1952'' (1990), pp 530-48.&lt;/ref&gt;

The federal government held land in trust for many tribes. Numerous claims cases had been presented to Congress because of failures in the government's management of such lands. There were particular grievances and claims due to the government's failure to provide for sustainable forestry. The [[Indian Claims Act]] included a requirement that the Interior Department manage Indian forest resources "on the principle of sustained-yield management." Representative [[Edgar Howard]] of Nebraska, co-sponsor of the Act and Chairman of the House Committee on Indian Affairs, explained that the purpose of the provision was "to assure a proper and permanent management of the Indian Forest" under modern sustained-yield methods so as to "assure that the Indian forests will be permanently productive and will yield continuous revenues to the tribes."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Shaunnagh Dorsett|author2=Lee Godden|title=A Guide to Overseas Precedents of Relevance to Native Title|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sngSc7rT5oAC&amp;pg=PA228|year=1998|publisher=Aboriginal Studies Press|page=228}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Implementation and results===
The act slowed the practice of allotting communal tribal lands to individual tribal members. It did not restore to Indians land that had already been patented to individuals, but much land at the time was still unallotted or was allotted to an individual but still held in trust for that individual by the U.S. government.  Because the Act did not disturb existing private ownership of Indian reservation lands, it left reservations as a [[Checkerboarding (land)|checkerboard]] of tribal or individual trust and fee land, which remains the case today.          .

However, the Act also allowed the U.S. to purchase some of the fee land and restore it to tribal trust status.  Due to the Act and other actions of federal courts and the government, more than two million acres (8,000&amp;nbsp;km²) of land were returned to various tribes in the first 20 years after passage.

In 1954, the [[United States Department of the Interior]] (DOI) began implementing the [[Indian termination policy|termination]] and relocation phases of the Act, which had been added by Congress. These provisions were the result of the continuing interest by some members of Congress in having American Indians assimilate to the majority society. Among other effects, termination resulted in the legal dismantling of 61 tribal nations within the United States and ending their recognized relationships with the federal government. This also ended the eligibility of the tribal nations and their members for various government programs to assist American Indians.&lt;ref&gt;Canby, William (2004). ''American Indian Law'', p. 24. {{ISBN|0-314-14640-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of the "Dismantled Tribes" 46 regained their legal status as indigenous communities.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}

===Constitutional challenges===
Since the late 20th century and the rise of Indian [[activism]] over [[sovereignty]] issues, as well as many tribes' establishment of [[casino gambling]] on reservations as a revenue source, the US Supreme Court has been repeatedly asked to address the IRA's constitutionality.  The provision of the Act that is controversial is the one that allows the US government to acquire non-Indian land (by voluntary transfer) and convert it to Indian land ("take it into trust").  In so doing, the US government partially removes the land from the jurisdiction of the state, which makes certain activities, such as casino gambling, possible on the land for the first time. It also makes the land exempt from state property taxes and some other state taxes.  Consequently, many people oppose implementation of this part of the Act and, typically represented by state or local governments, they sue to prevent it.

In 1995, South Dakota challenged the authority of the [[United States Secretary of the Interior|Interior Secretary]], under the IRA, to take {{convert|91|acre|m2}} of land into trust on behalf of the [[Lower Brule Sioux Tribe]] (based on the [[Lower Brule Indian Reservation]]), in ''South Dakota v. United States Dep't of the Interior'', 69 F.3d 878, 881-85 (8th Cir. 1995). The [[Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals]] found Section 5 of the IRA to be unconstitutional, ruling that it violated the non-delegation doctrine and that the Secretary of Interior did not have the authority to take the land into trust.&lt;ref name=doj&gt;[http://www.justice.gov/enrd/4522.htm ''South Dakota v. Dept. of Interior'' (1995)], Department of Justice&lt;/ref&gt;

The US Department of the Interior (DOI) sought U.S. Supreme Court review. But, as DOI was implementing new regulations related to land trusts, the agency asked the Court to remand the case to the lower court, to be reconsidered with the decision to be based on the new regulations. The US Supreme Court granted Interior's petition, vacated the lower court's ruling, and remanded the case back to the lower court.&lt;ref name=doj/&gt;

Justices Scalia, O'Connor and Thomas dissented, stating that "[t]he decision today—to grant, vacate, and remand in light of the Government's changed position—is both unprecedented and inexplicable." They went on, "[W]hat makes today's action inexplicable as well as unprecedented is the fact that the Government's change of legal position does not even purport to be applicable to the present case."&lt;ref&gt;''Dep't of the Interior v South Dakota'', 519 U.S. 919, 919-20, 136 L. Ed. 2d 205, 117 S. Ct. 286 (1996)&lt;/ref&gt; Seven months after the Supreme Court's decision to grant, vacate, and remand, the DOI removed the land in question from trust.&lt;ref name=doj/&gt;

In 1997, the Lower Brulé Sioux submitted an amended trust application to DOI, requesting that the United States take the {{convert|91|acre|m2}} of land into trust on the Tribe's behalf. South Dakota challenged this in 2004 in district court, which upheld DOI's authority to take the land in trust. The state appealed to the Eighth Circuit, but when the court reexamined the constitutionality issue, it upheld the constitutionality of Section 5 in agreement with the lower court. The US Supreme Court denied the State's petition for ''certiorari''. Since then, district and circuit courts have rejected non-delegation claims by states. The Supreme Court refused to hear the issue in 2008.&lt;ref name=doj/&gt;

In 2008 (before the US Supreme Court heard the ''Carcieri'' case below), in ''MichGO v Kempthorne'', Judge [[Janice Rogers Brown]] of the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals wrote a dissent stating that she would have struck down key provisions of the IRA. Of the three circuit courts to address the IRA's constitutionality, Judge Brown is the only judge to dissent on the IRA's constitutionality.  The majority opinion upheld its constitutionality.&lt;ref&gt;United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit [http://pacer.cadc.uscourts.gov/common/opinions/200804/07-5092-1113553.pdf ''MichGO v Kempthorne&lt;--dead link'']&lt;/ref&gt; The U.S. Supreme Court did not accept the ''MichGO'' case for review, thus keeping the previous precedent in place.  The First, Eighth and Tenth Circuits of the U.S. Court of Appeals have upheld the constitutionality of the IRA.&lt;ref&gt;''Carcieri v Kempthorne'', 497 F.3d 15, 43 (1st Cir. 2007), overruled as ''Carcieri v. Salazar'' (U.S. Supreme Court);  ''South Dakota v United States Dep't of Interior'', 423 F.3d 790, 798-99 (8th Cir. 2007); ''Shivwits Band of Paiute Indians v. Utah'', 428 F.3d 966, 974 (10th Cir. 2005).&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, ''Carcieri v Kempthorne'' was argued before the U.S. Supreme Court; the Court ruled on it in 2009, with the decision called ''[[Carcieri v. Salazar]]''.&lt;ref&gt;555 U.S. 379 (Feb. 24, 2009)&lt;/ref&gt; In 1991, the [[Narragansett Indian]] tribe bought {{convert|31|acre|m2}} of land. They requested that the DOI take it into trust, which the agency did in 1998, thus exempting it from many state laws. The State was concerned that the tribe would open a [[casino]] or tax-free business on the land and sued to block the transfer. The state argued that the IRA did not apply because the Narragansett was not "now under federal jurisdiction" as of 1934, as distinguished from "federally recognized."&lt;ref&gt;''Carcieri'' ("[i]n 1934, the Narragansett Indian Tribe ... was neither federally recognized nor under the jurisdiction of the federal government.")&lt;/ref&gt;  In fact, the Narragansett had been placed under [[Rhode Island]] guardianship since 1709.  In 1880, the tribe was illegally pressured into relinquishing its tribal authority to Rhode Island. The tribe did not receive federal recognition until 1983, after the 1934 passage of the IRA. The US Supreme Court agreed with the State.

In a challenge to the U.S. DOI's decision to take land into trust for the [[Oneida Indian Nation]] in present-day [[New York (state)|New York]], [[Upstate Citizens for Equality]] (UCE), New York, [[Oneida County, New York|Oneida County]], [[Madison County, New York|Madison County]], the town of [[Verona, New York|Verona]], the town of [[Vernon, New York|Vernon]], and others argue that the IRA is unconstitutional.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.upstate-citizens.org/USDC-UCE-v-US.htm Actual Complaint filed in court]&lt;/ref&gt;  Judge Kahn dismissed UCE's complaint, including the failed theory that the IRA is unconstitutional, on the basis of longstanding and settled law on this issue.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20130205075716/http://www.uticaod.com/news/x1224398048/Another-ruling-supports-Oneidas-trust-land-push "Judge dismisses citizen-group's claims"], ''Utica OD''&lt;/ref&gt;  The US Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit affirmed the dismissal.&lt;ref&gt;Upstate Citizens for Equality v. United States, No. 15-1688 (2d Cir. 2016)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Approval by tribes ===

Section 18 of the IRA required that members of the affected Indian nation or tribe vote on whether to accept it within one year of the effective date of the act (25 U.S.C. 478), and had to approve it by a majority. There was confusion about who should be allowed to vote on creating new governments, as many non-Indians lived on reservations many Indians owned no land there, and also over the effect of abstentions.
Under the voting rules, abstentions were counted as yes votes,&lt;ref&gt;Terry Anderson, Sovereign Nations or Reservations: An Economic History of American Indians. Pacific Research Institute for Public Policy 1995, p. 143&lt;/ref&gt; but in [[Oglala Lakota]] culture, for example, abstention had traditionally equaled a no vote.  The resulting confusion caused disputes on many reservations about the results.
When the final results were in, 172 tribes had accepted the act, and 73 had rejected it.&lt;ref&gt;T. H. Watkins, ''Righteous Pilgrim: The Life and Times of Harold L. Ickes, 1874-1952'' (1990) p 541&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://indiancountrymedianetwork.com/history/events/franklin-delano-roosevelt-a-new-deal-for-indians/ Indian Country Today August 9. 2016 reports 174 approved and 78 disapproved]&lt;/ref&gt;  The largest tribe, the [[Navajo Nation|Navajo]], had been badly hurt by the federal [[Navajo Livestock Reduction]] Program, which took away half their livestock and jailed dissenters. They strongly opposed the act, John Collier the chief promoter, and the entire Indian New Deal.&lt;ref&gt;Donald A. Grinde Jr, "Navajo Opposition to the Indian New Deal." ''Integrated Education'' (1981) 19#3-6  pp: 79-87.&lt;/ref&gt; Historian Brian Dippie notes that the Indian Rights Association denounced Collier as a 'dictator' and accused him of a "near reign of terror" on the Navajo reservation. Dippie adds that, "He became an object of 'burning hatred' among the very people whose problems so preoccupied him."&lt;ref&gt;Brian W. Dippie, ''The Vanishing American: White Attitudes and U.S. Indian Policy'' (1991) pp 333-36, quote p 335&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
Historians have mixed reactions to the Indian New Deal. Many praise Collier's energy and his initiative. Philp praised Collier's Indian New Deal for protecting Indian freedom to engage in traditional religious practices, obtaining additional relief money for reservations, providing a structure for self-government, and enlisting the help of anthropologists who respected traditional cultures. However, he concludes that the Indian New Deal was unable to stimulate economic progress nor did it provide a usable structure for Indian politics. Philp argues these failures gave ammunition to the return to the previous policy of termination that took place after Collier resigned in 1945.&lt;ref&gt;Kenneth R. Philp, "Termination: A Legacy of the Indian New Deal." ''Western Historical Quarterly'' (1983) pp: 165-180.&lt;/ref&gt;  In surveying the scholarly literature, Schwartz concludes that there is:
:a near consensus among historians of the Indian New Deal that Collier temporarily rescued Indian communities from federal abuses and helped Indian people survive the Depression but also damaged Indian communities by imposing his own social and political ideas on them.&lt;ref&gt;E. A. Schwartz, "Red Atlantis Revisited: Community and Culture in the Writings of John Collier," ''American Indian Quarterly'' (1994) 18#45 p 508.&lt;/ref&gt;

Collier's reputation among the Indians was mixed—praised by some, vilified by others.{{sfn|Wallis|Parsons|2001|p=78}}  He antagonized the [[Navajo Nation|Navajo]], the largest tribe, as well as the [[Seneca people]],{{sfn|Hauptman|1979|pp=15-22; 60-62}}  [[Iroquois]], and many others.{{sfn|Hauptman|1988|p=xii}} Anthropologists criticized him for not recognizing the diversity of Native American lifestyles.{{sfn|Hauptman|1979|pp=15-22; 60-62}} Hauptman argues that his emphasis on Northern Pueblo arts and crafts and the uniformity of his approach to all tribes are partly explained by his belief that his tenure as Commissioner would be short, meaning that packaging large, lengthy legislative reforms seemed politically necessary.{{sfn|Hauptman|1988|p=xii, 29}}

The Reorganization Act was wide-ranging legislation authorizing tribal self-rule under federal supervision, putting an end to land allotment and generally promoting measures to enhance tribes and encouraging education.&lt;ref&gt;Graham D. Taylor, ''The New Deal and American Indian Tribalism: The Administration of the Indian Reorganization Act, 1934-45'' (U of Nebraska Press, 1980), ch 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

Having described the American society as "physically, religiously, socially, and aesthetically shattered, dismembered, directionless",&lt;ref&gt;John Collier, "Does the Government Welcome the Indian Arts?" ''The American Magazine of Art. Anniversary Supplement'' vol. 27, no. 9, Part 2 (1934): 10-13&lt;/ref&gt; Collier was later criticized for his romantic views about the moral superiority of traditional society as opposed to modernity.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen J. Kunitz, "The social philosophy of John Collier." ''Ethnohistory'' (1971): 213-229. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/481531 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;   Philp says after his experience at the Taos Pueblo, Collier "made a lifelong commitment to preserve tribal community life because it offered a cultural alternative to modernity....His romantic stereotyping of Indians often did not fit the reality of contemporary tribal life."&lt;ref&gt;Kenneth R. Philp. "Collier, John" [http://www.anb.org/articles/15/15-00139.html;  ''American National Biography Online'' Feb. 2000. Access Date: May 05 2015]&lt;/ref&gt;

The act has helped conserve the communal tribal land bases. Collier supporters blame Congress for altering the legislation proposed by Collier, so that it has not been as successful as possible. On many reservations, its provisions exacerbated longstanding differences between traditionals and those who had adopted more European-American ways. Many Native Americans believe their traditional systems of government were better for their culture.&lt;ref&gt;William Canby, ''American Indian Law'' (2004) p 25.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Indiana Harbor Belt Railroad Co. v. American Cyanamid Co.''''', 916 [[F.2d]] 1174 ([[United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit|7th Cir.]] 1990) is a decision of the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit]] authored by [[Judge]] [[Richard Posner]].  The case has subsequently become a staple of first year [[Torts]] courses taught in [[Law school in the United States|American law schools]], where the case is used to address the question of when it is better to use [[negligence]] liability or [[strict liability]].&lt;ref&gt;David Rosenberg, "The Judicial Posner on Negligence Versus Strict Liability: ''Indiana Harbor Belt Railroad Co. v. American Cyanamid Co.''", in ''The Harvard Law Review'' (2007), p. 1210.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
[[American Cyanamid]] was a [[manufacturer]] that [[Chemical industry|produced chemicals]], including [[acrylonitrile]], which is used in making [[acrylic fiber]]s, [[plastics]], [[dyes]], [[Pharmaceutical industry|pharmaceutical chemicals]], and other products.&lt;ref&gt;''Indiana Harbor Belt Railroad Co. v. American Cyanamid Co.'', 916 F.2d 1174, 1174 (7th Cir. 1990)&lt;/ref&gt;  In January 1979, American Cyanamid wanted to ship acrylonitrile from its [[Chemical plant|plant]] in [[Louisiana]] to its plant in [[New Jersey]].&lt;ref name="Cir 1990"&gt;''Indiana Harbor Belt Railroad Co. v. American Cyanamid Co.'', 916 F.2d 1174, 1175 (7th Cir. 1990)&lt;/ref&gt;  It therefore [[leased]] a [[tank car]] from the North American Car Corporation, filled it with 20,000 gallons of liquid acrylonitrile, and the [[Missouri Pacific Railroad]] then picked up the car from the Louisiana plant.&lt;ref name="Cir 1990"/&gt;  Missouri Pacific Railroad delivered the car to the [[Indiana Harbor Belt Railroad]], a [[Switching and terminal railroad|switching railroad]], who were to switch the car to [[Consolidated Rail Corporation|Conrail]] for final delivery to the New Jersey plant.&lt;ref name="Cir 1990"/&gt;

However, several hours after the car arrived at the Blue Island [[Rail yard|Rail Yard]] in [[Riverdale, Illinois]] (on Riverdale's border with [[Blue Island, Illinois]]), Indiana Harbor Belt Railroad employees noticed that acrylonitrile was gushing out of the car because the lid on the outlet was broken.&lt;ref name="Cir 1990"/&gt;  Concerned because acrylonitrile is [[flammable]], highly [[toxic]], and possibly a [[carcinogen]], local officials ordered an evacuation until the leak could be stopped and the car moved to a remote part of the rail yard.&lt;ref name="Cir 1990"/&gt;

Worried that the leak may have resulted in [[soil contamination]] and [[water contamination]], the [[Illinois Environmental Protection Agency]] subsequently ordered Indiana Harbor Belt Railroad to [[Environmental remediation|clean up]] the site.&lt;ref name="Cir 1990"/&gt;  Indiana Harbor Belt Railroad ultimately spent approximately $980,000 on cleaning up the rail yard.&lt;ref name="Cir 1990"/&gt;

Indiana Harbor Belt Railroad [[Lawsuit|brought suit]] against American Cyanamid seeking to recover the cleanup costs from American Cyanamid.  The suit set forth two legal theories: (1) that American Cyanamid had [[negligence|negligently]] maintained the leased car; and (2) that, since American Cyanamid was involved in an abnormally dangerous activity, it was [[strict liability|strictly liable]] for the consequences of a spill or other accident to the shipment en route.&lt;ref name="Cir 1990"/&gt;

American Cyanamid [[Motion (legal)|moved]] to [[motion (legal)#Motion to dismiss|dismiss]] Indiana Harbor Belt Railroad's strict liability claim against it, but the [[United States federal judge|district judge]] denied this motion.&lt;ref name="Cir 1990"/&gt;  Indiana Harbor Belt Railroad therefore moved for [[summary judgment]] and won.&lt;ref name="Cir 1990"/&gt;  The district judge then dismissed Indiana Harbor Belt Railroad's negligence claim so that American Cyanamid could appeal the strict liability decision to the Seventh Circuit.&lt;ref&gt;''Indiana Harbor Belt Railroad Co. v. American Cyanamid Co.'', 916 F.2d 1174, 1176 (7th Cir. 1990)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Opinion==
Circuit Judge Posner begins by stating that this case presents a [[case of first impression]] so there is no [[precedent]] directly governing the disposition of the case, and leaving the court to decide the case on the basic principles underlying [[Illinois]] tort law. To address the question of whether [[strict liability]] is appropriate in this case, Posner turns to several foundational 19th century cases, including ''[[Rylands v. Fletcher]]'' (1868) and ''[[Guille v. Swan]]'' (1822), and then consults the [[Restatement of Torts, Second|Restatement (Second) of Torts]]. Section 520 of the Restatement sets out six factors for determining when strict liability is appropriate: "Guille is a paradigmatic case for strict liability. (a) The risk (probability) of harm was great, and (b) the harm that would ensue if the risk materialized could be .. great ... The confluence of these two factors established the urgency of seeking to prevent such accidents. (c) Yet such accidents could not be prevented by the exercise of due care ... (d) The activity [is] not a matter of common usage ... (e) The activity [is] inappropriate to the place in which it took place ... [and], (f) Reinforcing(d), [is] the value to the community of the activity great enough to offset its unavoidable risks[?]"
Posner explains the relationship between negligence and strict liability as follows: &lt;blockquote&gt;The baseline [[common law]] regime of tort liability is [[negligence]]. When it is a workable regime, because the hazards of an activity can be avoided by being careful (which is to say, nonnegligent), there is no need to switch to [[strict liability]]. Sometimes, however, a particular type of accident cannot be prevented by taking care but can be avoided, or its consequences minimized, by shifting the activity in which the accident occurs to another locale, where the risk or harm of an accident will be less..., or by reducing the scale of the activity in order to minimize the number of accidents caused by it.... By making the actor strictly liable—by denying him in other words an excuse based on his inability to avoid accidents by being more careful—we give him an [[incentive]], missing in a negligence regime, to experiment with methods of preventing accidents that involve not greater exertions of care, assumed to be futile, but instead relocating, changing, or reducing (perhaps to the vanishing point) the activity giving rise to the accident... The greater the risk of an accident...and the costs of an accident if one occurs..., the more we want the actor to consider the possibility of making accident-reducing activity changes; the stronger, therefore, is the case for strict liability.&lt;ref&gt;''Indiana Harbor Belt Railroad Co. v. American Cyanamid Co.'', 916 F.2d 1174, 1177 (7th Cir. 1990)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Turning from these general principles to the case, Posner states that "we have been given no reason...for believing that a negligence regime is not perfectly adequate to remedy and deter, at reasonable cost, the accidental spillage of acrylonitrile from rail cars."&lt;ref name="Cir 1990x"&gt;''Indiana Harbor Belt Railroad Co. v. American Cyanamid Co.'', 916 F.2d 1174, 1179 (7th Cir. 1990)&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, the court says that under the facts of this case, the chemical spill was caused by the negligence of either (a) the North American Car Corporation in failing to maintain or inspect the rail car properly; (b) American Cyanamid in failing to maintain or inspect the car; or (c) the Missouri Pacific Railroad when it had custody of the rail car.&lt;ref name="Cir 1990x"/&gt;  Under a negligence regime, the role of the courts is to consider the evidence and reach a determination as to which party's negligence caused the spill, and the negligent party would then have to pay the cleanup costs.  Under a strict liability regime, American Cyanamid would have to pay the cleanup costs, even if it did not act negligently, and the court is not convinced that there are compelling reasons to force American Cyanamid to bear the cleanup costs if it was not negligent.

The court rejected a number of arguments made by Indiana Harbor Belt Railroad as to why strict liability should be applied in this case. Indiana Harbor Belt Railroad argued that the potentially calamitous nature of a chemical spill meant that strict liability should be imposed on shippers shipping hazardous chemicals. The court, however, found that "if a tank car is carefully maintained the danger of a spill of acrylonitrile is negligible. If this is right there is no compelling reason to move to a regime of strict liability."&lt;ref name="Cir 1990"/&gt;

Indiana Harbor Belt Railroad also argued that a strict liability regime would encourage manufacturers not to ship hazardous materials through densely populated cities and instead choose alternate routes. The court rejected this argument on the grounds that given the US railway system's [[Spoke-hub distribution paradigm|hub and spoke]] design, it was difficult for shippers to avoid shipping their goods through densely populated neighborhoods, because the hubs of this system are all located in large cities.&lt;ref&gt;''Indiana Harbor Belt Railroad Co. v. American Cyanamid Co.'', 916 F.2d 1174, 1180 (7th Cir. 1990)&lt;/ref&gt; The court said that Indiana Harbor Belt Railroad had failed to demonstrate that the shipment of acrylonitrile by rail through populated areas is so hazardous an activity that even when shippers exercise due care, the law should nevertheless create incentives to relocate the activity to nonpopulated areas or to reduce the scale of the activity.&lt;ref name="Cir 1990y"&gt;''Indiana Harbor Belt Railroad Co. v. American Cyanamid Co.'', 916 F.2d 1174, 1181 (7th Cir. 1990)&lt;/ref&gt;

Indiana Harbor Belt Railroad also pointed to concerns of [[Distributive justice|distributional fairness]], arguing that American Cyanamid was a huge firm better able to bear the costs of an environmental cleanup, while Indiana Harbor Belt Railroad was a struggling regional railroad that nearly went bankrupt after it was ordered to pay the cleanup costs in this case. The court was unconvinced by this argument, and noted that Indiana Harbor Belt Railroad was a [[Joint railway|jointly owned subsidiary]] of [[Consolidated Rail Corporation|Conrail]] and the [[Soo Line Railroad]], corporations with [[Deep pocket|pockets just as deep]] as American Cyanamid's.&lt;ref name="Cir 1990y"/&gt; The court concluded that concerns about distributional fairness did not therefore require imposing strict liability on shippers.&lt;ref name="Cir 1990y"/&gt; Implicit in much of Posner's reasoning is the idea that, because each of the potential defendants are interlinked in a commercial chain, liability imposed on any one defendant would simply lead to higher prices passed on to the others. This makes an exact determination of where liability lies unnecessary.

The court therefore held that a shipper of a hazardous chemical by rail is not strictly liable for the consequences of a spill or other accident to the shipment en route. A shipper may, however, be held liable if a plaintiff can prove that the shipper acted negligently.

The current incarnation arose as a resurrection of the original site that was taken down by legal action from the [[MPAA]]; it is not associated in any way with the old staff or owners of the site, and is to be understood as a separate continuation.&lt;ref name=Resurrected-TF&gt;{{cite web|author1=Ernesto|title=IsoHunt Resurrected Less Than Two Weeks After $110 Million MPAA Deal|url=http://torrentfreak.com/isohunt-resurrected-less-than-two-weeks-after-110-million-mpaa-deal-131029/|website=[[TorrentFreak]]|accessdate=4 June 2015|date=29 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It originated in 2003 as isohunt.com website for [[Direct Client-to-Client|IRC files]] search and reached over 13.7 million&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://isohunt.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=115374 |title=Toolbar and Stats |publisher=Isohunt.com |date= |accessdate=2013-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; torrents in its database and 20 million [[Peer-to-peer|peers]] from [[index (search engine)|indexed]] torrents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://isohunt.com/stats.php?mode=btSites |title=BitTorrent Sites Statistics |publisher=Isohunt.com |date= |accessdate=2009-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; With 7.4 million unique visitors {{as of|2006|5|lc=on}}, isoHunt was one of the most popular [[BitTorrent]] search engines. Thousands of torrents were added to and deleted from it every day. Users of isoHunt performed over 40 million unique searches per month. On October 19, 2008, isoHunt passed the 1 [[petabyte]] mark for torrents indexed globally. The site was the third most popular BitTorrent site {{as of|2008|lc=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://torrentfreak.com/top-10-torrent-sites-of-2008-081228/ |title=Top 10 Most Popular Torrent Sites of 2008 (stats from Alexa and Compete) |publisher=Torrentfreak.com |date=2008-12-28 |accessdate=2009-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to isoHunt, the total amount of shared content was more than 14.11 [[petabytes]] {{as of|2012|06|13|lc=on|df=US}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://isohunt.com/|title=Isohunt Home|date=2009-11-03|accessdate=2011-09-29|publisher=isohunt}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The site came to an end when the legal battles that isoHunt's founder had been in for years with conglomerates of [[IP rights]] holders over allegations of [[copyright infringement|copyright infringing]] came to a head. A settlement with the [[MPAA]] was reached in 2013, stipulating a $110 million reimbursement for damages and the site's closure that followed on October 21, 2013.&lt;ref name=110million-TF&gt;{{cite web|author1=Ernesto|title=IsoHunt Shuts Down After $110 Million Settlement With The MPAA|url=http://torrentfreak.com/isohunt-shuts-down-after-110-million-settlement-with-the-mpaa-131017/|website=[[TorrentFreak]]|accessdate=4 June 2015|date=17 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the end of October 2013 however, two sites with content presumably mirrored from isohunt.com were reported in media. One of them— isohunt.to became a de facto replacement of the original site.&lt;ref name=Resurrected-TF /&gt;

== History ==
isoHunt was founded in January 2003 by Gary Fung, a Canadian national. Its name is derived from the term [[ISO image]], used to describe a 1:1 soft copy of a disk (typically a CD or DVD).

On February 23, 2006, the [[Motion Picture Association of America|Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA)]] issued a press release stating they were suing isoHunt for copyright infringement.

On September 2, 2009, isoHunt announced the launch of a spinoff site, hexagon.cc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://torrentfreak.com/isohunt-launches-social-bittorrent-site-090902/ |title=isoHunt Launches ‘Social’ BitTorrent Site |publisher=torrentfreak.com |date= |accessdate=2009-12-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; The goal of hexagon.cc was to have a place for social groups based on certain niches to share specific content relevant to their interests.  It is down until further notice.

In early 2010, users in the US and along south eastern Canada were redirected to a stripped-down version called isoHunt Lite in order to remove some of the factors that were used in determining liability for infringement; however, full access was restored in early 2012.

In October 2013 Isohunt announced it would shut down indefinitely. After years of court battles over copyright infringement with the MPAA, Isohunt agreed to a settlement. Under the terms of the settlement Isohunt will shut down the site, and close three other sites that redirect to the Isohunt domain: Podtropolis, TorrentBox, and Edtk-it.com. Fung also agreed to pay $110 million in damages.

The site was shut down on October 21, 2013, two days earlier than originally planned, leaving a farewell message from Gary Fung that also explained that the rush was to prevent backup activity — possibly the one reported to have been started by [[ArchiveTeam]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://torrentfreak.com/archiveteam-works-hard-to-avert-isohunt-data-massacre-131020/ |title=ArchiveTeam Works Hard to Avert isoHunt Data Massacre |date=20 October 2013 |website=TorrentFreak |accessdate=21 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Legal ==

=== Correspondence with the MPAA ===
Selected items of email correspondence between Gary Fung and the [[MPAA]] have been posted on isoHunt.com.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=IH |url=http://isohunt.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=9273 |title=isoHunt Forum&amp;nbsp;— Letters from MPAA |publisher=Isohunt.com |date=2003-01-21 |accessdate=2009-10-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101007095929/http://isohunt.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=9273 |archivedate=October 7, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Lawsuit ===
In February 2006 it was announced that the [[MPAA]] had launched legal proceedings against isoHunt, [[TorrentBox]], [[TorrentSpy]], [[ed2k-it]], and several other BitTorrent indexing or tracker sites, alleging that these sites facilitate copyright infringement. On February 28, 2006 a lawsuit was filed against Gary Fung in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. Fung stands to oppose the [[Motion Picture Association of America|MPAA]] on legal grounds.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://isohunt.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=126788 |title=isoHunt Forums :: View topic&amp;nbsp;— isoHunt tells court why Hollywood is wrong |publisher=Isohunt.com |date= |accessdate=2009-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; On August 18, 2006, Judge Stanton granted a motion for case transfer from New York to California on the grounds of inconvenienced parties and similar cases already filed in the District Court of Central California.

On December 21, 2009, the court granted the MPAA's motion for [[summary judgment]], finding isoHunt and Fung liable for copyright infringement on the theory of inducement. The MPAA had presented evidence showing that the majority of content linked to on IsoHunt was infringing content, that the search engine was tuned to assist users in finding infringing works, and that Fung himself had made remarks suggesting the purpose of the site was to allow users to download infringing content. The court found that IsoHunt had not presented any satisfactory evidence to counter these claims, and at its core it was merely an "evolutionary modification" of [[Napster]] and [[Grokster]], two P2P systems that had previously been held liable for inducing copyright infringement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/news/2009/12/judge-slams-isohunt-infringement-old-wine-in-a-new-bottle.ars | title =isoHunt loses big: infringement "old wine in a new bottle"| author=John Timmer| publisher=Ars Technica}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a result, the court went on to issue a permanent injunction prohibiting IsoHunt to continue indexing and linking to infringing content.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/news/2010/05/1-down-5-to-go-isohunt-neutered-by-us-judge.ars|title=1 down, 5 to go? isoHunt neutered by US judge|author=Nate Anderson|publisher=Ars Technica}}&lt;/ref&gt; The case on appeal, dubbed ''[[Columbia Pictures Industries, Inc. v. Fung]]'', upheld the district court's findings on copyright infringement, but found that the injunction was overly burdensome to the extent it could prevent Fung from seeking legitimate employment, as certain provisions in the injunction would have prevented Fung from working in any technology company whose services could be used to infringe copyrighted content even if those companies were not engaged in copyright infringement.

=== DMCA takedown notices ===
IsoHunt has a history of complying with [[DMCA]] [[takedown notice]]s, and has worked with various copyright owners in the past, such as the [[RIAA]] and [[Microsoft]]. The site uses an [[ex-gratia]] takedown process modelled on the DMCA, even though the servers were relocated to [[Canada]] in January 2007 where the DMCA does not apply.&lt;ref name="dmca-cr"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://isohunt.com/dmca-copyright.php |title=isoHunt DMCA Copyright Policy |publisher=Isohunt.com |date=2007-01-22 |accessdate=2009-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cdfreaks.com/news/isoHunt-gets-shutdown-by-ISP-and-moves-to-Canada.html isoHunt gets shutdown by ISP and moves to Canada] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080906182434/http://www.cdfreaks.com/news/isoHunt-gets-shutdown-by-ISP-and-moves-to-Canada.html |date=2008-09-06 }}, CD Freaks&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Lawsuit against the CRIA ===
On September 8, 2008 Gary Fung announced on the isoHunt front page&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://isohunt.com|title=isohunt.com|author=|date=|work=isohunt.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; that he had made a preemptive move against an impending lawsuit from the [[Canadian Recording Industry Association|CRIA]] by filing a petition to the Supreme Court of British Columbia. Fung argues that isoHunt is merely a search engine to find torrents that are scattered around the web, much the same as [[Google]] or any other search engine can be used in the same way.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://isohunt.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=141381 |title=isoHunt Forums :: View topic&amp;nbsp;— isoHunt sues CRIA on legality of search engines |publisher=Isohunt.com |date= |accessdate=2009-10-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090216031028/http://isohunt.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=141381 |archivedate=February 16, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Internet service providers ===
On January 16, 2007, isoHunt was taken off-line, stating "Lawyers from our primary [[ISP]] decided to pull our plug without any advance notice". After a major hardware upgrade,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://isohunt.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=80731 |title=Hardware upgrade after servers move to Canada |publisher=Isohunt.com |date= |accessdate=2009-10-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090622030322/http://isohunt.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=80731 |archivedate=June 22, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the site resumed normal operation by January 22, 2007, although experiencing several brief periods of subsequent downtime due to server changes.

On July/August 2013, [[Federazione Industria Musicale Italiana|Federation of the Italian Music Industry]] obtained an order from the Court of Milan which demands [[Internet service provider|ISP]]s to block isoHunt's domain and IP address.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://torrentfreak.com/isohunt-blocked-by-court-order-following-music-industry-demand-130801/|title=IsoHunt Blocked By Court Order Following Music Industry Demand|author=|date=|work=TorrentFreak}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Shutdown as part of settlement with MPAA ===
On October 17, 2013 [[Variety.com]] announced the website isoHunt would shut down by Oct. 23, 2013, as part of a settlement in a massive copyright infringement suit filed by Hollywood studios, agreeing to pay $110 million for claims that the site induced the violation of copyrighted movies and TV shows although isoHunt never hosted such content. The settlement terms included a $110 million judgment against isoHunt and its owner, Gary Fung, ending a seven-year legal battle over its operations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2013/biz/news/isohunt-to-shut-down-as-part-of-settlement-with-studios-1200734509/|title=isoHunt To Shut Down As Part of Settlement With Studios - Variety|author=Ted Johnson|date=|work=Variety}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to court documents cited by the BBC, Fung's company will likely be able to pay only between two and four million dollars though.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-24580130|title=Piracy site IsoHunt to shut down and pay $110m|author=|date=|work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The site shut down on 21 October 2013, 2 days earlier than the announced date, leaving a note from Gary Fung and a link to a [[YouTube]] "trailer for the movie [[Terminator Salvation]]" that is actually a [[Rickroll]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/news/isohunt-shuts-early-to-prevent-archiving-owner-gary-fung-rickrolls-fans-8897103.html|title=IsoHunt shuts early to prevent archiving, owner Gary Fung rickrolls|author=James Vincent|date=25 October 2013|work=The Independent}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quotation|'''Initiating Self Destruct'''

This is it. We are shutting down isoHunt services a little early. I'm told there was this Internet archival team that wants to make historical copy of our .torrent files, I'm honoured that people thinks our site is worthy of historical preservation, but the truth is about 95% of those .torrent files can be found off Google regardless and mostly have been indexed from other BitTorrent sites in the first place. So I might as well do a proper send-off to you dear isoHunt users, before final shutdown sequence on Tuesday. It's been an adventure in the last 10.5 years working on isoHunt, a privilege working with some of the smartest guys I've worked with, and my life won't be the same without it. For what I'm working on next, please look up my blog on Google and follow me there. Because as the Terminator would say with a German accent,

'''''I'll be backkk'''''.|Gary Fung&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://torrentfreak.com/isohunt-shuts-down-early-to-block-backup-plan-131021/|title=isoHunt Shuts Down Early to Block Backup Plan|author=|date=|work=TorrentFreak}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Technical details==
In the beginning of 2007, isoHunt restructured its server setup and bought mostly new hardware for the cluster that operates the site. The cluster had a total of 34 [[AMD Opteron]] cores, 70 GB in [[RAM]] and 30 [[hard drive]]s ranging from [[SATA]]s to 15,000 [[Revolutions per minute|rpm]] [[SCSI]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.isohunt.com/forum/viewtopic.php?p=208021#208021 |title=Technical Details |publisher=Isohunt.com |date= |accessdate=2009-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The network started with a [[D-Link]] [[network switch|switch]] but due to multiple failures, isoHunt moved to a [[Force10]] switch. IsoHunt was uplinked through Neutral Data Centers Corp to a mix of bandwidth providers.

On October 30, 2013, two weeks following the shutdown of the original website, a group of people claiming to be dedicated to isoHunt's continuance brought a near-identical [[Website mirror|clone]] of the original website online, accessible via isohunt.to.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kerr|first=Dara|title=Isohunt BitTorrent site rises from the dead as Isohunt.to|url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-1023_3-57610145-93/isohunt-bittorrent-site-rises-from-the-dead-as-isohunt.to/|work=CNET Article|accessdate=31 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Former staff member of original isoHunt has made it clear that the team behind isohunt.com has not been involved in any way in 'resurrection' of isoHunt.&lt;ref name=Resurrected-TF /&gt;

Another site, isohunt.ee, has also been reported to be an unauthorized clone of the original site.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2013/10/not-even-two-weeks-after-shutdown-bittorrent-search-site-isohunt-is-back/|title=Not even two weeks after shutdown, clone of BitTorrent search site isoHunt opens|author=|date=|work=Ars Technica}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== OldPirateBay.org and The Open Bay ==
{{see also|The Pirate Bay#December 2014 raid}}

=== OldPirateBay.org ===
On December 13, 2014, just 4 days after a raid by [[Swedish police]] took ThePirateBay.se offline, the isoHunt.to team launched a new website, ''OldPirateBay.org'', mirroring the contents of a recent snapshot of [[The Pirate Bay]]. It is branded in isoHunt's style, featuring both a ghostly blue theme and the isoHunt logo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=OldPirateBay.org Search By IsoHunt Team|url=http://blog.isohunt.to/370/|accessdate=17 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The team stated that they would gladly take their copy of the site down if and when the original Pirate Bay came back online, which occurred on January 31, 2015.

=== The Open Bay ===
On December 19, 2014, isoHunt.to released a tool called The Open Bay at [https://web.archive.org/web/20131014003025/http://www.isohunt.com/ Openbay.isohunt.to], providing original source code and additional tools in order to allow users to deploy their own version of The Pirate Bay website.&lt;ref name="venture openbay"&gt;{{Cite web| title = isoHunt now lets anyone launch their own version of The Pirate Bay| author = Protalinski, Emil| work = VentureBeat| date = 19 December 2014| accessdate = 19 December 2014| url = https://venturebeat.com/2014/12/19/isohunt-now-lets-anyone-launch-their-own-version-of-the-pirate-bay/

Jersey's [[List of national legal systems|legal system]] is 'mixed' or '[[Legal pluralism|pluralistic]]', and sources of law are in French and English languages, although since the 1950s the main [[working language]] of the legal system is English.

== Sources of law ==

=== Legislation adopted by the States of Jersey ===
Jersey's legislature, the [[States of Jersey|States Assembly]] makes [[legislation]] affecting most areas of activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lawinstitute.ac.je/default.asp?contentID=629 |publisher=Institute of Law |title=Study Guide for Jersey Legal System and Constitutional Law, chapter 8 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131228104105/http://www.lawinstitute.ac.je/default.asp?contentID=629 |archivedate=2013-12-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Laws ====
[[File:1771 onwards Jersey Recueil des Lois.jpg|thumb|''Recueil de Lois de Jersey'' from 1771]]
The highest form of legislation made by the States is 'Laws'. If a proposed Law is likely to be controversial, the general desirability of having new legislation on the topic may be debated before the Law drafted. The procedure for making Laws is set out in the Standing Orders of the States of Jersey.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jerseylaw.je/Law/lawsinforce/consolidated/16/16.800.15_StandingOrdersoftheStatesofJersey_RevisedEdition_1January2011.pdf|title=Standing Orders of the States of Jersey|date=1 January 2011}}; {{cite web|first=Lucy|last=Marsh-Smith|title=The Production of Legislation in the Crown Dependencies|year=2010|publisher=Jersey Law Review|url=http://www.jerseylaw.je/Publications/jerseylawreview/feb10/JLR1002_Marsh-Smith.aspx|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120316221553/http://www.jerseylaw.je/Publications/jerseylawreview/feb10/JLR1002_Marsh-Smith.aspx|archivedate=2012-03-16|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Once the Law is in draft from, it starts the legislative process as a ''projet de loi'', which may be introduced to the States by a [[Cabinet of Jersey|Minister]], any States Member, a [[scrutiny panel]] or the Comité des [[Connétable (Jersey and Guernsey)|Connétables]]. At the stage known as 'first reading', the title of the projet is read out and the projet is 'lodged [[Greffier|au Greffe]]' providing a two to six week breathing space for Members to read the draft Law. Under Article 16 of the Human Rights (Jersey) Law 2000,&lt;ref name="HRLaw"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jerseylaw.je/Law/display.aspx?url=lawsinforce%5Chtm%5CLawFiles%5C2000%2FJersey_Law_19-2000.htm|title=Human Rights (Jersey) Law 2000|publisher=JerseyLaw|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131224110631/http://www.jerseylaw.je/Law/display.aspx?url=lawsinforce%5Chtm%5CLawFiles%5C2000%2FJersey_Law_19-2000.htm|archivedate=2013-12-24|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Minister or other person lodging the projet au Greffe must make a written statement that the provisions of the projet are compatible with [[ECHR|Convention rights]] or 'make a statement that although [he or she] is unable to make a statement of compatibility, [he or she] nevertheless wants the States to proceed with the projet'. At the next 'second reading' stage, there is a formal debate in the States chamber during which members consider the principle of the projet and then scrutinise the draft in detail. At 'third reading' stage there is an opportunity for minor drafting errors to be corrected. Finally, members vote to adopt the law.

The Law is then submitted via the [[Lieutenant Governor of Jersey|Lieutenant Governor]]'s office for transmission to London, where [[Politics of Jersey#Relations with the United Kingdom|officials]] in the [[Ministry of Justice (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Justice]] examine the Law. In 2010, the [[House of Commons Justice Committee]] was highly critical of the UK Government's approach, finding that 'The Islands are more than adequately advised by their own Law Officers and Parliamentary Counsel. It seems a strange use of Ministry of Justice resources ... to engage in a kind of legislative oversight which does not restrict itself to the constitutional grounds for scrutiny'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=House of Commons Justice Committee|title=Crown Dependencies, 8th Report of 2009-10, HC 56-1, para 62|url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200910/cmselect/cmjust/56/5607.htm#a6}}&lt;/ref&gt; This process may take several months. In an unusual move in 2011, campaigners against a Law that sought to reduce the number of Senators in the States petitioned the Privy Council to advise the Queen to refuse Royal Assent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Save Senators plea reaches Privy Council|publisher=Jersey Evening Post|date=7 June 2011|url=http://www.thisisjersey.com/2011/06/07/save-senators-plea-reaches-privy-council/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Once official scrutiny is complete in London, the Law is formally presented to Her Majesty for [[Royal Assent]] at a meeting of the [[Privy Council of the United Kingdom|Privy Council]], usually held at Buckingham Palace or Windsor Castle.

After a Law receives Royal Assent, the final step is for it be registered with the [[Royal Court of Jersey]]. At this point it is 'passed'. The Law is then brought into force at a date decided by the relevant Jersey minister. There may be a considerable delay between a Law being passed and it becoming legally effective if, for example, civil servants need to be trained, computer systems put in place or money found to pay for the new scheme.

Laws adopted and passed are published in print as ''Recueil de Lois'' de Jersey and online by the [[Jersey Legal Information Board]] on the Jersey Law&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jerseylaw.je/Law/LawsInForce/default.aspx|title=Laws in Force|publisher=JerseyLaw|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120928234724/http://www.jerseylaw.je/Law/LawsInForce/default.aspx|archivedate=2012-09-28|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; website.

==== Other types of legislation ====
In Jersey, there are other types of legislation in addition to Laws.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Institute of Law | title = Jersey Legal System and Constitutional Law | chapter = 8 | publisher = Institute of Law | year = 2011 | location = Jersey | url = http://www.lawinstitute.ac.je/downloads/2011.10.20%20Jersey%20Legal%20System%20-%20FINAL%20with%20ISBN.pdf | accessdate = 2012-03-27 | isbn = 978-1-908716-00-2 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120314235510/http://www.lawinstitute.ac.je/downloads/2011.10.20%20Jersey%20Legal%20System%20-%20FINAL%20with%20ISBN.pdf | archivedate = 2012-03-14 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Regulations''': these are used where a Law delegates to the States Assembly power to make legally binding rules to implement a named Law.
* '''Triennial Regulations''': since the 18th century, the States of Jersey has had power to make provisional regulations of up to three years' duration.
* '''Orders and Rules''': these are generally made by a Minister, within the scope of powers set out in a Law.

=== Customary law ===
Custom is a source of law in the Jersey legal system. It has been described as "the product of generally accepted usage and practice. It has no formal sanction or authority behind it other than the general consensus of opinion within the community".&lt;ref&gt;Snell v Beadle [2001] UKPC 5 at [16] http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKPC/2001/5.html&lt;/ref&gt; It differs from [[English common law]] where rules stated by a judge of a senior court are binding law ''because'' they are stated by a judge. In customary law, the role of the [[Judiciary of Jersey (list)|judiciary]] is to look for evidence of what is "generally accepted usage and practice".

Many rules of customary law have crystallised to such an extent (through repeated acknowledgment by the [[Royal Court of Jersey|Royal Court]] and in the way people conduct their affairs) that everyone accepts them as binding without discussion. The boundaries of the [[Parishes of Jersey|Parishes]], the existence of the office of [[Bailiff (Channel Islands)#Bailiff of Jersey|Bailiff]] and various rules relating to possession of land and inheritance fall into this category. Many rules of customary law are to be found discussed in the texts of the "Commentators" and the case law of the Jersey courts.  Where the works of the commentators do not deal with situation, the Jersey courts look at factual evidence to work out is the "generally accepted usage and practice".&lt;ref&gt;See e.g. ''Moran v Deputy Registrar for the Parish of St Helier'' [2007] JRC 151 http://www.jerseylaw.je/Judgments/UnReportedJudgments/Documents/Display.aspx?url=2007/07-08-02_Moran_and_Kemp_and_The_Deputy_Registrar_for_St_Helier_151.htm {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120113055727/http://www.jerseylaw.je/Judgments/UnReportedJudgments/Documents/Display.aspx?url=2007%2F07-08-02_Moran_and_Kemp_and_The_Deputy_Registrar_for_St_Helier_151.htm |date=2012-01-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The customary law of the [[Duchy of Normandy]] is particularly influential as a source of law in Jersey, even though Jersey ceased to part of Normandy in 1204. Norman law developed in two main epochs–the "Ancienne coutume" (1199–1538) and the "Coutume reformée" (1538–1804).

==== Ancienne coutume of Normandy ====
The northern and western regions of Medieval Europe "were a patchwork of territorial areas in which the main source of law was customs, usages and practices which had become relatively fixed and settled".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Institute of Law | title = Jersey Legal System and Constitutional Law | chapter = Chapter 2 | publisher = Institute of Law | year = 2011 | location = Jersey | url = http://www.lawinstitute.ac.je/downloads/2011.10.20%20Jersey%20Legal%20System%20-%20FINAL%20with%20ISBN.pdf | accessdate = 2012-03-27 | isbn = 978-1-908716-00-2 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120314235510/http://www.lawinstitute.ac.je/downloads/2011.10.20%20Jersey%20Legal%20System%20-%20FINAL%20with%20ISBN.pdf | archivedate = 2012-03-14 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Norman law was based on oral tradition and repeated practices in [[Feudal]] society.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

When in 1309 [[Edward II of England]] sent Justices to Jersey, the people of Jersey were "asked by what law they claimed to be governed, the law of England, of Normandy, or by some special customs of their own? They answered 'By the law of Normandy, and referred the Justices to the ''Summa of Malcael'' [the Jersey name for the Grand Coutumier], where the Norman laws are well embodied'... But they added, and this a clause that caused much trouble later, 'except that we have certain customs used in this island from time immemorial".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

In the 16th century, two commentaries on the Grand Coutumier, written in Normandy, have been influential in Jersey law. [[:fr:Guillaume Le Rouillé|Guillaume Rouillé of Alençon]] (also known as Le Rouillé) was the author of ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=3-xCAAAAcAAJ&amp;dq=intitle%3ALe%20intitle%3AGrant%20intitle%3ACoustumier&amp;pg=PT3#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Le Grant Coustumier du pays &amp; duché de Normendie : tres utile &amp; profitable a tous practiciens]'' (1534; 1539). He also produced commentary on the neighbouring province of [[Maine (province)|Maine]] (pictured).

Guillaume Terrien's ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=xYaA_5KCB04C&amp;dq=Commentaires%20du%20droit%20civil%20tant%20public%20que%20priv%C3%A9%20observ%C3%A9%20au%20pays%20et%20Duch%C3%A9%20de%20Normandie&amp;pg=PP3#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Commentaires du droit civil, tant public que privé, observé au pays et Duché de Normandie]'' was first published in 1574. Dawes explains: "Terrien’s own work comprised the selecting of texts from the ''Grand Coutumier'', putting them into an order which suited his scheme (even to the point of cutting and pasting quite disparate texts) and then commenting on the resulting amalgam. To this commentary a further author added notes headed 'Additio', more often than not in Latin".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| last =Dawes| first =Gordon| authorlink =| title =A note on Guillaume Terrien and his work| journal =Jersey and Guernsey Law Review| volume =| issue =| pages =| publisher =Jersey and Guernsey Law Review Ltd| location =| year =2007| language =| url =http://www.jerseylaw.je/Publications/jerseylawreview/feb07/JLR0702_Dawes.aspx| jstor =| issn =| doi =| id =| mr =| zbl =| jfm =| accessdate =27 August 2011| deadurl =yes| archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20120113055355/http://www.jerseylaw.je/Publications/jerseylawreview/feb07/JLR0702_Dawes.aspx| archivedate =13 January 2012| df =}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two modern versions of the text of the Grand Coutumier have been produced. The first was by [[Jurat]] William Laurence de Gruchy entitled ''L’Ancienne Coutume de Normandie: Réimpression, éditée avec de légères annotations'' (1881), based on Le Rouillé’s 1539 edition, using a double-column format setting out the Latin and French texts side by side.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

==== Coutume Reformée of Normandy ====
[[File:Berault_Coutume_Reformée_3rd_edn_1620.jpg|thumb|Berault's 1620 commentary]]
The second period in the development of Norman custom was between 1583 and 1804 and is known as the ''Coutume reformée'' (the reformed custom). In 1453, [[Charles VII of France]] issued orders that all the customary laws of France should be "redacted", in other words set out systematically and approved under royal authority. The [[Duchy of Normandy]] was the last part of France to comply with this order but the new text was eventually prepared and received royal approval in 1585 by [[Henry III of France]].

There are two reasons why the Coutume reformée might be thought to have little relevance to [[Jersey]]: it was created 380 years after Jersey had ceased formally to be part of the [[Duchy of Normandy]] and it was a text sanctioned by the king of France. Nonetheless, Jersey lawyers and courts made frequent references to the Coutume reformée and by virtue of its assimilation into Jersey law over the centuries it is regarded as a source of the island's law.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

Within France, customary law was abolished in 1804 with the introduction of uniform [[Napoleonic code|codes]] of civil and criminal law across the whole of France.

==== Jersey commentators on custom ====
As well as relying on commentaries produced in France, Jersey has an indigenous legal literature on custom. In the 17th century, [[Jean Poingdestre]] (1609–1691) and [[Philippe Le Geyt]] (1635–1716) wrote several works. Some chapters of [[Charles Sydney Le Gros|C.S. Le Gros]]' 20th century work, ''Traité du Droit Coutumier d l'Ile de Jersey'' also remain relevant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=C.S.|last=Le Gros|title=Traité du Droit Coutumier d l'Ile de Jersey|location=St Helier|publisher=Jersey and Guernsey Law Review Ltd|year=1943|ISBN=978-0-9557611-0-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Legislative reforms of custom ====
Many rules of customary law have been amended or abolished by legislation in the later 19th and 20th centuries. Examples of this include:
* “Any rule of customary law, that a contract passed before the Royal Court for the transfer of immovable property may be annulled, at the instance of the heirs or devisees, as the case may be, of the transferor, if he or she dies within 40 days of the passing of the contract, is abolished” (Customary Law Amendment (No. 2) (Jersey) Law 1984).
* In customary law, the age of majority was 20 years; the Age of Majority (Jersey) Law 1999 reduces this to 18 years.
* “The rule under customary law that all gifts to a concubine are null is hereby abolished” (Wills and Successions (Jersey) Law 1993).
* Customary law did not permit a cause of action for/against a person to survive the person’s death against/for the benefit of the person’s estate; Customary Law Amendment (Jersey) Law 1948 reversed this situation.
* The ''année de jouissance'' (the right of an executor to have the income arising during the administration of a moveable estate for a year and a day) was abolished by the Wills and Successions (Jersey) Law 1993.

=== Influence of English and French law ===
Some fields of Jersey, such as negligence and administrative law, are heavily influenced by [[English common law#Common law|English common law]]. In other branches of law, notably contract, Jersey courts may have regard to [[French civil law]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Jersey Law Commission |title=Consultation Paper No. 5: The Jersey Law of Contract |date=October 2002 |url=http://www.lawcomm.gov.je/Contract.htm }}&lt;BR&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Institute of Law |title=Study Guide on Jersey Contract Law |url=http://www.lawinstitute.ac.je/default.asp?contentID=629 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131228104105/http://www.lawinstitute.ac.je/default.asp?contentID=629 |archivedate=2013-12-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Human rights ===
The Human Rights (Jersey) Law 2000,&lt;ref name="HRLaw"/&gt; based closely on the United Kingdom's [[Human Rights Act 1998]], requires Jersey courts so far as possible to interpret legislation so that it is compatible with rights and freedoms guaranteed by the [[European Convention on Human Rights]]. Jersey public bodies are required to act in conformity with Convention rights.

In January 2012, Jersey introduced laws to recognise same-sex civil partnerships.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-jersey-16536572 | work=BBC News | title=Jersey recognises civil partnerships | date=13 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Language of Jersey law ==
During the 20th century, the main working language of the Jersey legal system changed from French to English.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Timothy|last=Hanson|title=The Language of Law: the importance of French|year=2005|publisher=Jersey Law Review|url=http://www.jerseylaw.je/Publications/jerseylawreview/june05/JLR0506_Hanson.aspx|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120316221249/http://www.jerseylaw.je/Publications/jerseylawreview/june05/JLR0506_Hanson.aspx|archivedate=2012-03-16|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before the 1930s, almost all legislation passed by the States Assembly was in French. Since then, French is used only where new legislation makes amendments to legislation originally drafted in French.&lt;ref&gt;All legislation is available on the [http://www.jerseylaw.je/ Jersey Law] website.&lt;/ref&gt;

The conveyancing of immoveable property was carried out using contracts drafted in French until October 2006,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Richard|last=Falle|title=The structure of a pro forma Jersey conveyance|year=2004|publisher=Jersey Law Review|url=http://www.jerseylaw.je/Publications/jerseylawreview/june04/JLR0406_Falle.aspx|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120316221329/http://www.jerseylaw.je/Publications/jerseylawreview/june04/JLR0406_Falle.aspx|archivedate=2012-03-16|df=}}&lt;BR&gt;{{cite web|first=David|last=Trotter|title=Commentary on Jersey Conveyance|year=2005|publisher=Jersey Law Review|url=http://www.jerseylaw.je/Publications/jerseylawreview/june05/JLR0506_Trotter.aspx|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120316221404/http://www.jerseylaw.je/Publications/jerseylawreview/june05/JLR0506_Trotter.aspx|archivedate=2012-03-16|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; after which contracts were required to be in English.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Richard|last=Falle|title=At the stroke of a pen …|year=2007|publisher=Jersey and Guernsey Law Review|url=http://www.jerseylaw.je/Publications/jerseylawreview/feb07/JLR0702_Falle.aspx#page83|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120316221411/http://www.jerseylaw.je/Publications/jerseylawreview/feb07/JLR0702_Falle.aspx#page83|archivedate=2012-03-16|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several French [[Jersey Legal French|words and expressions]] used in Jersey differ from [[Standard French]].

==Precedent and law reporting==
[[File:Tables des Décisions de La Cour Royale de Jersey.jpg|thumb|''Tables de Décisions de la Cour Royal de Jersey'' 1885-1978]] The Jersey legal system does not follow the strict rules of [[binding precedent]] that exist in common law jurisdictions such as [[English law|England and Wales]].&lt;ref&gt;''Qatar v Al Thani'' 1999 Jersey Law Reports 118.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Courts of Jersey#Royal Court|Royal Court]] is not bound by its own previous decisions on a point of law but it will generally follow them unless persuaded that the earlier decision was wrongly decided. A similar approach is taken by the [[Courts of Jersey#Appeal courts|Court of Appeal]]. All Jersey courts are, however, bound by points of law decided by the [[Judicial Committee of the Privy Council]] in previous Jersey appeals to that court.

During the 19th and 20th centuries a series of improvements to the system of writing and reporting judgments was put in place. In 1885, the [[Royal Court of Jersey|Royal Court]] began to publish the ''Tables des Décisions de la Cour Royal de Jersey''–a subject index to decided cases, prepared by the [[Greffier]].&lt;ref&gt;Institute of Law, Jersey, ''Jersey Legal System and Constitutional Law'' (2011), chapter 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1950, [[Charles Thomas Le Quesne]] [[Queen's Counsel|KC]] returned to Jersey from practice at the [[Barristers in England and Wales|English Bar]] and was appointed [[Lieutenant Bailiff of Jersey|Lieutenant Bailiff]]. Up to this point, the [[Royal Court of Jersey|Royal Court]]'s judgments were in the French style of ''jugements motivés'',{{French spelling}} written in French by the [[Greffier]] rather than the judge, and expressing the reasons for the court's decision only very briefly. Le Quesne changed the language of judgments to English and adopted the [[common law]] style of judgments, where the judge gives detailed reasons for accepting or rejecting the rival submissions made at trial by [[counsel]].&lt;ref&gt;''Attorney General v Weston'' 1979 Jersey Judgments 141.&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1950 and 1984, the Royal Court published its and the Court of Appeal judgments in a series of [[law reports]] known as the ''Jersey Judgments'' (eleven volumes in total). From 1984, judgments have been published a new series of [[law reports]] known as the ''Jersey Law Reports''.&lt;ref&gt;Law Reports International Ltd {{cite web |url=http://www.lawreports.com/jersey.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-08-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120123022208/http://www.lawreports.com/jersey.htm |archivedate=2012-01-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, the Jersey Legal Information Board (JLIB) was set up to promote "accessibility of the written law and legal processes to the public and of an integrated and efficient legal system, through the use of information technology and by other means".&lt;ref&gt;Jersey Legal Information Board (Incorporation) Law 2004 {{cite web |url=http://www.jerseylaw.je/Law/display.aspx?url=lawsinforce%2fconsolidated%2f16%2f16.335_JerseyLegalInformationBoard%28Incorporation%29Law2004_RevisedEdition_1January2006.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-05-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303181215/http://www.jerseylaw.je/Law/display.aspx?url=lawsinforce%2Fconsolidated%2F16%2F16.335_JerseyLegalInformationBoard%28Incorporation%29Law2004_RevisedEdition_1January2006.htm |archivedate=2016-03-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Judgments of the Royal Court and Court of Appeal are published online on [https://web.archive.org/web/20120929022406/http://www.jerseylaw.je/Search/default.aspx?target=uj www.jerseylaw.je], with open access to "unreported" judgments as part of the [[Free Access to Law Movement]].

== Judiciary ==
The head of the [[Judiciary of Jersey (list)|judiciary in Jersey]] is the [[Bailiff of Jersey|Bailiff]], who as well as performing the judicial functions of a [[chief justice]] is also the President ([[Speaker (politics)|presiding officer]]) of the [[legislature|States of Jersey]] and has certain civic, ceremonial and executive functions. The Bailiff's functions may be exercised by the [[Judiciary of Jersey (list)#Deputy Bailiffs of Jersey|Deputy Bailiff]].

=== Judicial appointments processes ===
The posts of Bailiff and [[Judiciary of Jersey (list)#Deputy Bailiffs of Jersey|Deputy Bailiff]] are Crown appointments, formally made by Her Majesty the Queen, on [[Politics of Jersey#The Crown|advice]] of the UK government's [[Secretary of State for Justice]].

[[File:Juges Jour d'la Libéthâtion 2009 a.jpg|thumb|The Bailiff and Jurats outside the Royal Court in 2009]]An appointment process has developed in recent years, without a legislative basis, for vacancies for the [[Judiciary of Jersey (list)#Deputy Bailiffs of Jersey|Deputy Bailiff]], Attorney General for Jersey and Solicitor General for Jersey. This involves advertising for candidates and the preparation of a shortlist by a selection panel consisting of the Bailiff (in the chair), the senior [[Jurat]] and the chairman of the [[Jersey Appointments Commission]]. A process of consultation is then carried out, including the Jurats, the [[States Consultative Panel]] (which includes the [[Chief Minister of Jersey|Chief Minister]]), a number of elected members of the States, senior lawyers (the [[Bâtonnier]], the President of the Law Society, the former President of the [[Law Society of Jersey]] and the President of the [[Chambre des Ecrivains]]), the other Crown Officers and the local [[Judiciary of Jersey (list)#Commissioners|Commissioner]] of the [[Courts of Jersey#Royal Court|Royal Court]]. All candidates on the shortlist are then interviewed by the selection panel. A single name is then sent by the Lieutenant Governor to the Secretary of State for Justice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Evidence of Mr M Birt (Bailiff), public hearing 4 May 2010|pages=5–15|publisher=Review of the Roles of the Crown Officers|url=http://www.gov.je/SiteCollectionDocuments/Government%20and%20administration/R%20Bailiff%20Transcript%2020100504%20WM.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This process has not been used for appointment to the office of Bailiff on the basis that "The Secretary of State has accepted that the position of Deputy Bailiff is a training ground for the position of Bailiff, and that, therefore, all things being equal, you would expect to move up, assuming of course that you have performed to everyone's satisfaction".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Evidence of Mr M Birt (Bailiff), public hearing 4 May 2010|page=14|publisher=Review of the Roles of the Crown Officers|url=http://www.gov.je/SiteCollectionDocuments/Government%20and%20administration/R%20Bailiff%20Transcript%2020100504%20WM.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jurat]]s are elected by an [[electoral college]] consisting of the Bailiff, the Jurats, the [[Constable#Channel Islands|Connétables]], the elected members of the states, advocates and solicitors of the Royal Court.&lt;ref name="RoyalCourtLaw"&gt;Article 4 of the {{cite web|title=Royal Court (Jersey) Law 1948|url=http://www.jerseylaw.je/law/display.aspx?url=lawsinforce%2fconsolidated%2f07%2f07.770_RoyalCourtLaw1948_RevisedEdition_1January2011.htm#Toc268785111|publisher=JerseyLaw|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120316221620/http://www.jerseylaw.je/law/display.aspx?url=lawsinforce%2Fconsolidated%2F07%2F07.770_RoyalCourtLaw1948_RevisedEdition_1January2011.htm#Toc268785111|archivedate=2012-03-16|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Voting is by secret ballot.

Commissioners of the Royal Court are appointed by the Bailiff for the hearing of a specified cause or matter or a specified term.&lt;ref name="RoyalCourtLawII"&gt;Part II of the {{cite web|title=Royal Court (Jersey) Law 1948|url=http://www.jerseylaw.je/law/display.aspx?url=lawsinforce%2fconsolidated%2f07%2f07.770_RoyalCourtLaw1948_RevisedEdition_1January2011.htm#Toc268785122|publisher=JerseyLaw|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120316221620/http://www.jerseylaw.je/law/display.aspx?url=lawsinforce%2Fconsolidated%2F07%2F07.770_RoyalCourtLaw1948_RevisedEdition_1January2011.htm#Toc268785122|archivedate=2012-03-16|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Bailiff appoints the [[Courts of Jersey#Magistrate's Court|Magistrate]] and the Assistant Magistrate (who hold full-time salaried posts) and part-time Relief Magistrates (legal practitioners who carry out duties on a daily fee-paid basis).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Loi (1864) concernant la charge de Juge d’Instruction|url=http://www.jerseylaw.je/law/display.aspx?url=lawsinforce%2fconsolidated%2f07%2f07.525_Loi%281864%29ConcernantLaChargeDeJugeD%2527Instruction_RevisedEdition_1January2012.htm|publisher=JerseyLaw}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is now normal for the Bailiff to convene a panel to advise on salaried appointments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Evidence of Mr M Birt (Bailiff), public hearing 4 May 2010|pages=17–18|publisher=Review of the Roles of the Crown Officers|url=http://www.gov.je/SiteCollectionDocuments/Government%20and%20administration/R%20Bailiff%20Transcript%2020100504%20WM.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Removal from office===
The Bailiff, Deputy Bailiff and members of the [[Jersey Court of Appeal]] 'hold office during good behaviour'.&lt;ref&gt;In relation to the Court of Appeal: {{cite web|title=Court of Appeal (Jersey) Law 1961|url=http://www.jerseylaw.je/Law/display.aspx?url=lawsinforce%2fconsolidated%2f07%2f07.245_CourtofAppealLaw1961_RevisedEdition_1January2010.htm#Toc249951726|publisher=JerseyLaw|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120316221706/http://www.jerseylaw.je/Law/display.aspx?url=lawsinforce%2Fconsolidated%2F07%2F07.245_CourtofAppealLaw1961_RevisedEdition_1January2010.htm#Toc249951726|archivedate=2012-03-16|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whereas senior judges in England and Wales who are appointed by Crown may only be removed from office with the consent of both Houses of Parliament,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Senior Courts Act (previously known as the Supreme Court Act) 1981, section 11(3)|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1981/54/section/11|publisher=Legislation.gov.uk}}&lt;BR&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.judiciary.gov.uk/about-the-judiciary/the-judiciary-in-detail/jud-acc-ind/judges-and-parliament|title=Judges and parliament|publisher=Judiciary of England and Wales}}&lt;/ref&gt; the United Kingdom [[Secretary of State for Justice]] may dismiss a Jersey judge appointed by the Crown without the agreement [[States of Jersey]]. This happened in 1992, when the then Deputy Bailiff [[Vernon Tomes]] was dismissed from office by the [[Home Secretary]] (the UK minister who at the time was responsible for the [[Crown Dependencies]]) on grounds of his delays in producing written judgments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=House of Commons|title=Debates vol 208 cc93-4W|date=19 May 1992|url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/written_answers/1992/may/19/jersey-bailiff-dismissal#S6CV0208P0_19920519_CWA_184}}&lt;BR&gt;{{cite news|last=Dyer|title='Dismissal of "slow" Judge angers Jersey|newspaper=The Guardian|date=13 May 1992}}&lt;BR&gt;{{cite news|first=Nick|last=Cohen|title=Jersey in revolt after Clarke sacks judge|newspaper=The Independent|date=13 May 1992}}&lt;BR&gt;{{cite news|first=Nick|last=Cohen|title=Jersey to review constitutional links with UK|newspaper=The Independent|date=14 May 1992}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jurats hold office up to the age of 72 years. A Jurat who 'in the opinion of the Court, is permanently unable, through physical or mental incapacity, or for any other reason, efficiently to carry out the duties of the office, may be called upon by the Court to resign'. A Jurat who refuses to resign may be removed from office by Order of Her Majesty in Council on the petition of the Superior Number (the Bailiff and five or more Jurats) of the [[Courts of Jersey#Royal Court|Royal Court]].&lt;ref&gt;Article 9 of the Royal Court (Jersey) Law 1948&lt;/ref&gt;

The Bailiff may if he 'thinks fit, terminate the appointment of a Commissioner on the ground of incapacity or misbehaviour'.&lt;ref name="RoyalCourtLawII"/&gt;

The Magistrates, who are also appointed by the Bailiff not the Crown, may not be removed from office 'except by virtue of an Order of Her Majesty in Council'.&lt;ref&gt;Article 2(3) of the {{cite web|title=Loi (1864) concernant la charge de Juge d’Instruction|url=http://www.jerseylaw.je/law/display.aspx?url=lawsinforce%2fconsolidated%2f07%2f07.525_Loi%281864%29ConcernantLaChargeDeJugeD%2527Instruction_RevisedEdition_1January2012.htm|publisher=JerseyLaw}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2008, the Chief Minister informed the [[States of Jersey]] that the Magistrate-Designate, Ian Christmas, has 'agreed not to sit as a judge following a discussion with the former Bailiff as a result of a criminal investigation into an alleged [[fraud]]'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.statesassembly.gov.je/AssemblyQuestions/2009/3%20Deputy%20of%20St%20Martin%20to%20CM%20re%20suspension%20of%20Magistrate%20designate.pdf|title=Extract from States of Jersey Hansard|year=2009|publisher=States of Jersey}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=States of Jersey|title=Official Report ('Hansard')|date=8 June 2010|url=http://www.statesassembly.gov.je/Pages/Hansard.aspx?docid=30cbb644c43134fba74ddd68c3b4e9e6_StatesAssembly#_Toc264536235|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131224111039/http://www.statesassembly.gov.je/Pages/Hansard.aspx?docid=30cbb644c43134fba74ddd68c3b4e9e6_StatesAssembly#_Toc264536235|archivedate=24 December 2013|df=}}&lt;BR&gt;{{cite web|title=Further delay in fraud case|publisher=Jersey Evening Post|date=15 March 2011|url=http://www.thisisjersey.com/2011/03/15/further-delay-in-fraud-case/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mr Christmas was subsequently convicted of one count of fraud and sentenced to fifteen months in prison.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jerseylaw.je/judgments/unreportedjudgments/documents/display.aspx?url=2012%2f12-10-05_AG-v-Lewis_Christmas_Foot_and_Cameron_177.htm|title=Attorney General v Lewis, Christmas, Foot and Cameron (2012) JRC 177|publisher=JerseyLaw|date=5 October 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131224110638/http://www.jerseylaw.je/judgments/unreportedjudgments/documents/display.aspx?url=2012%2F12-10-05_AG-v-Lewis_Christmas_Foot_and_Cameron_177.htm|archivedate=24 December 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been reported that the Bailiff's Office has asked the United Kingdom [[Ministry of Justice]] to arrange for a UK judge to undertake a disciplinary investigation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thisisjersey.com/news/2012/07/27/what-next-for-fraud-judge/|title=What next for fraud judge?|publisher=Jersey Evening Post|date=27 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thisisjersey.com/news/2012/09/25/christmas/|title=New inquiry to decide whether Christmas retains his position|date=25 September 2012|publisher=Jersey Evening Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tonymusings.blogspot.co.uk/2012/10/ian-christmas-legal-background.html|title=Ian Christmas: the Legal Background|publisher=Tony's musings|date=9 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Judicial independence in Jersey===

====Code of Conduct====
All judges in Jersey are bound by a [http://www.gov.je/Government/NonexecLegal/BailiffsChambers/Pages/CodeConduct.aspx code of conduct] promulgated by the [[Jersey Judicial Association]] in 2007. This requires judges to 'uphold the integrity and independence of the judiciary and perform their duties with competence, diligence and dedication'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Code of conduct for members of the judiciary of Jersey, paragraph 1|year=2007|url=http://www.gov.je/Government/NonexecLegal/BailiffsChambers/Pages/CodeConduct.aspx|publisher=Jersey Government}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====ECHR Article 6====
All courts in Jersey are required under [[Article 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights]] to be 'independent and impartial'.&lt;ref name="HRLaw"/&gt; In 2000, the [[European Court of Human Rights]] held in ''McGonnell v United Kingdom''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bailii.org/eu/cases/ECHR/2000/62.html|title=McGonnell v United Kingdom (2000) ECHR 62|publisher=British and Irish Legal Information Institute}}&lt;/ref&gt; that there was a breach of Article 6 in ''Guernsey'' where the Bailiff or Deputy Bailiff sat as President of the [[States of Guernsey]] when proposed legislation was being debated and then subsequently sat as a judge of the [[Royal Court of Guernsey]] in a case where that legislation was relevant. The Court, noting that there was no suggestion that the Bailiff 'was subjectively biased', stated that the 'mere fact' that this happened was capable of casting doubt on the Bailiff's impartiality. A Bailiff and Deputy Bailiff in Jersey is able to avoid a ''McGonnell'' situation simply by not sitting in the [[Royal Court of Jersey|Royal Court]] in cases concerned with legislation that was debated when he presided in the [[States of Jersey|States]]. The current Bailiff, Mr [[Michael Birt (Bailiff of Jersey)|Michael Birt]] has conceded that 'we probably need to improve our systems to be very compliant with ''McGonnell'' and that one probably ought to keep a running list of those statutes where I have presided so at least I could invite the parties to consider whether they wanted to object or not'.&lt;ref&gt;Pages 46-47, Review of the Roles of the Crown Officers, Public Hearing 4 May 2010&lt;/ref&gt; In a recent review chaired by [[Lord Carswell]], set up by the [[States of Jersey]], a legal opinion was commissioned from [[Rabinder Singh (Barrister)|Rabinder Singh]] QC in which he expressed the view that 'there is no reason in law why the present constitutional arrangements in respect of the Bailiff should be altered. However, the trend suggests that the tide of history is in favour of reform and that the legal position will be different in 10 years time'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gov.je/Government/Pages/StatesReports.aspx?ReportID=491|title=Report into Review of Crown Officers|publisher=Jersey Government|date=6 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The report of Lord Carswell's inquiry concluded that Mr Singh's opinion 'provides an additional reason why the Bailiff should cease to be the President of the States'.&lt;ref&gt;Para 5.16 of Report into Review of Crown Officers&lt;/ref&gt; The [[States of Jersey]] have not accepted this aspect of the Carswell report.

In recent years, a former [[States of Jersey|State's]] member Mr [[Stuart Syvret]] has argued in legal proceedings in England and Jersey that all members of [[Judiciary of Jersey (list)|the Jersey judiciary]] lack the appearance of independence and impartiality. In March 2009, the High Court in London refused him permission to commence a judicial review claim against [[Home Secretary]] [[Jack Straw]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/jersey/7946988.stm |title=Jersey abuse case review rejected |first= |last=Anon|work=[[BBC News]] |date=17 March 2009 |publisher=[[BBC]] |location=[[London, England|London]] |accessdate=5 September 2011}}; {{cite web |url= http://www.channelonline.tv/channelonline_jerseynews/displayarticle.asp?id=400612 |title=Syvret loses High Court bid |first= |last=Anon |work=channelonline.tv |date=17 March 2009 |accessdate=5 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Jersey, subsequent proceedings related to a criminal prosecution for a data protection offence (he named a former nurse on his [[blog]], who he said was guilty of murdering patients), judicial reviews and appeals relating to that criminal case, and a separate civil action brought by Syvret against fellow politicians and Law Officers in connection with his removal from office as minister for health.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example:&lt;BR&gt;{{cite news|title=Nursing a grievance in Jersey|newspaper=Private Eye (no 1288)|date=13 May 2011|page=30}}&lt;BR&gt;{{cite news|title=Former Jersey senator jailed over data-breach blog|newspaper=The Daily Telegraph|date=19 November 2010|page=11}}&lt;BR&gt;{{cite news|title=Hemming shields man|newspaper=Birmingham Evening Mail|date=26 October 2009|page=8}} (referring to Liberal Democrat MP [[John Hemming (politician)|John Hemming]]'s assistance to Syvret)&lt;BR&gt;{{cite news|first=Andrew|last=Hough|title=Jersey senator to claim asylum at Commons|newspaper=The Daily Telegraph|date=26 October 2009|page=16}}&lt;BR&gt;{{cite news|title=Charge against senator in abuse cover-up claim|newspaper=The Times|date=20 July 2009|page=26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Syvret argues that he cannot have a fair trial in the island and there is a lack of appearance of independence and impartiality because judges are appointed by the [[Bailiff (Channel Islands)|Bailiff]] and the other judges have attended social events with the Bailiff. Syvret's arguments relating to lack of independence and impartiality have been rejected by the Royal Court and Court of Appeal in Jersey on a number of occasions between 2009 and 2011.&lt;ref&gt;Judgment of Sir Richard Tucker (sitting as a Commissioner of the Royal Court) in {{cite web|title=Syvret v Attorney General (2009) JRC 165 |url=http://www.jerseylaw.je/Judgments/UnreportedJudgments/Documents/Display.aspx?url=2009/09-08-18_Syvret-v-AG_165.htm |publisher=JerseyLaw |date=18 August 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131224105155/http://www.jerseylaw.je/Judgments/UnreportedJudgments/Documents/Display.aspx?url=2009%2F09-08-18_Syvret-v-AG_165.htm |archivedate=24 December 2013 |df= }}&lt;BR&gt;Judgement of Clare Montgomery QC (sitting as a judge of the Court of Appeal) in {{cite web|title=Syvret v Attorney General (2009) JCA 181 |url=http://www.jerseylaw.je/Judgments/UnreportedJudgments/Documents/Display.aspx?url=2009/09-09-04_Syvret-v-AG_JCA181.htm |publisher=JerseyLaw |date=4 September 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131224111432/http://www.jerseylaw.je/Judgments/UnreportedJudgments/Documents/Display.aspx?url=2009%2F09-09-04_Syvret-v-AG_JCA181.htm |archivedate=24 December 2013 |df= }}&lt;BR&gt;Judgment of Mr Julian Clyde-Smith (sitting as a Commissioner of the Royal Court) in {{cite web|title=Syvret v Attorney General (2010) JRC 179 |url=http://www.jerseylaw.je/Judgments/UnreportedJudgments/Documents/Display.aspx?url=2010/10-10-08_Syvret-v-AG_and_Connetable_of_Grouville_179.htm |publisher=JerseyLaw |date=6 October 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131224111747/http://www.jerseylaw.je/Judgments/UnreportedJudgments/Documents/Display.aspx?url=2010%2F10-10-08_Syvret-v-AG_and_Connetable_of_Grouville_179.htm |archivedate=24 December 2013 |df= }}&lt;BR&gt;Judgment of Jonathan Sumption QC (sitting as a Commissioner of the Royal Court) in {{cite web|title=Syvret v Chief Minister and others (2011) JRC 116 |url=http://www.jerseylaw.je/Judgments/UnreportedJudgments/Documents/Display.aspx?url=2011/11-06-20_Syvret-v-Chief_Minister_and_Others_116.htm |publisher=JerseyLaw |date=20 June 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131224103945/http://www.jerseylaw.je/Judgments/UnreportedJudgments/Documents/Display.aspx?url=2011%2F11-06-20_Syvret-v-Chief_Minister_and_Others_116.htm |archivedate=24 December 2013 |df= }}&lt;BR&gt;Judgment of MS Jones QC (sitting in the Jersey Court of Appeal) in {{cite web|title=Syvret v HM Attorney General (2011) JCA 130 |url=http://www.jerseylaw.je/Judgments/UnreportedJudgments/Documents/Display.aspx?url=2011/11-07-05_Syvret-v-AG_and_Connetable_of_Grouville_JCA130.htm |publisher=JerseyLaw |date=5 July 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131224095020/http://www.jerseylaw.je/Judgments/UnreportedJudgments/Documents/Display.aspx?url=2011%2F11-07-05_Syvret-v-AG_and_Connetable_of_Grouville_JCA130.htm |archivedate=24 December 2013 |df= }}&lt;BR&gt;Judgment of the Court of Appeal (Michael Beloff QC, Clare Montgomery QC and Christopher Nugee QC) in {{cite web|title=Syvret v HM Attorney General (2011) JCA 146 |publisher=JerseyLaw |url=http://www.jerseylaw.je/Judgments/UnreportedJudgments/Documents/Display.aspx?url=2011/11-07-28_Syvret-v-AG_and_Connetable_of_Grouville_JCA146.htm |date=28 July 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131224112152/http://www.jerseylaw.je/Judgments/UnreportedJudgments/Documents/Display.aspx?url=2011%2F11-07-28_Syvret-v-AG_and_Connetable_of_Grouville_JCA146.htm |archivedate=24 December 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Jersey legal profession ==
[[File:Institute of Law, St Helier, Jersey.jpg|thumb|Institute of Law, Seale Street, St Helier|upright]]The Jersey legal profession has three types of Jersey-qualified lawyers - Advocates, Solicitors and [[Public notary#United Kingdom|Notaries Public]].&lt;ref name="1997Law"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jerseylaw.je/Law/display.aspx?url=lawsinforce%2fconsolidated%2f07%2f07.070_AdvocatesandSolicitorsLaw1997_RevisedEdition_1January2009.htm#Toc203181030|title=Advocates and Solicitors Law 1997|publisher=JerseyLaw|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120316221753/http://www.jerseylaw.je/Law/display.aspx?url=lawsinforce%2fconsolidated%2f07%2f07.070_AdvocatesandSolicitorsLaw1997_RevisedEdition_1January2009.htm#Toc203181030|archivedate=2012-03-16|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Vict/6-7/90|title=Public Notaries Act 1843}} (United Kingdom), section 4&lt;/ref&gt; [[Advocate#Advocates in the Channel Islands|Advocates]] have rights of audience to represent clients in all courts. Jersey solicitors have no general rights of audience. Notaries have no rights of audience. The Law Society of Jersey&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jerseylawsociety.je/ Law Society of Jersey ]&lt;/ref&gt; is the professional body responsible for professional conduct. Notaries are regulated by the Faculty Office of the Archbishop of Canterbury through the [[Dean of the Arches]], referred to as the [[Master of the Faculties]], who is normally an English [[Queen's Counsel|QC]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.facultyoffice.org.uk|title=Faculty Office}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some law firms focus on legal practice relating to Jersey's [[Economy of Jersey#Financial .26 legal services|finance industry]], the largest being: [[Appleby Spurling Hunter|Appleby]]; Bedell Cristin; [[Carey Olsen]]; [[Mourant Ozannes]]; and [[Ogier (law firm)|Ogier]], all of which are regarded as part of the "[[offshore magic circle]]". Smaller firms and sole practitioners also provide a wide range of legal services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jerseylawsociety.je/lawfirms.htm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110613012913/http://www.jerseylawsociety.je/lawfirms.htm|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2011-06-13|title=Law Firms|publisher=Law Society of Jersey}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several law firms now have offices in both Jersey and [[Guernsey]] but the legal professions of the two islands are separate, as they are separate from those in England, Wales and Scotland. Most notaries in Jersey are employed by, or are partners in, local firms of Jersey Advocates or Solicitors, although some are in English solicitors firms or practising purely as notaries, independent of the general legal profession. There is a local Jersey Notaries Society.

The Law Officers of the Crown are responsible for criminal prosecution work and for providing legal advice to the Crown, ministers and other members of the Assembly of the [[States of Jersey]]. The Attorney General and his deputy, the Solicitor General, are non-voting members of the States Assembly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gov.je/Government/NonexecLegal/LawOfficers/Pages/index.aspx|title=Law Officers|publisher=Jersey Government}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The process of qualifying as a Jersey lawyer is regulated by the Advocates and Solicitors (Jersey) Law 1997&lt;ref name="1997Law"/&gt; and is similar for both advocates and solicitors. Since 2009, candidates for the [[Jersey law]] examinations are required to enrol on the Jersey Law Course run by the Institute of Law, Jersey.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lawinstitute.ac.je/ Institute of Law]&lt;/ref&gt; They are required to take five compulsory papers: (i) Jersey legal system and constitutional Law; (ii) Law of contract and the law relating to security on moveable property and bankruptcy; (iii) testate and intestate succession; law of immoveable property and conveyancing; and civil and criminal procedure. In addition, candidates must take one of three option papers: (i) company law; (ii) trusts law; or (iii) family law.

The admission of lawyers as Notaries in Jersey is governed by an order of the [[Master of the Faculties]]. It is necessary to show that a prospective Notary has been in actual practise in Jersey as a Jersey-qualified Advocate or Solicitor for a period of 5 years and is required to pass an examination in Notarial Practice. The Master does however retain a discretion to admit those who are not so qualified "...in appropriate circumstances".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.facultyoffice.org.uk/TheNotaries%28JerseyandGuernsey%29AdmissionOrder2012.pdf|title=The Notaries (Jersey and Guernsey) Admission Order 2012|publisher=Faculty Office|date=5 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Legal aid ==
There is no publicly funded [[legal aid]] system in Jersey, though the [[States of Jersey]] may exercise discretion to pay defence legal fees in serious criminal trials&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A system in need of overhaul|publisher=Jersey Evening Post|date=15 September 2010|url=http://jerseyeveningpost.com/news/2010/09/15/a-system-in-need-of-overhaul/}}.&lt;BR&gt;{{cite web|first=Elaine|last=Byrne|title=£3m cost may lead to legal aid review|publisher=Jersey Evening Post|date=21 October 2009|url=http://jerseyeveningpost.com/news/2009/10/21/3m-cost-may-lead-to-legal-aid-review/}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in cases involving children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Dolores|last=Cowburn|title=Serious case review cost the Island over £600,000|publisher=Jersey Evening Post|date=15 September 2010|url=http://www.thisisjersey.com/2010/09/15/serious-case-review-cost-the-island-over-600000/}}&lt;BR&gt;{{cite web|title=The Bailiff champions welfare of children|publisher=Jersey Evening Post|date=1 July 2008|url=http://www.thisisjersey.com/2008/07/01/the-bailiff-champions-welfare-of-children/}}&lt;/ref&gt; During their first 15 years of practice, Jersey Advocates and Solicitors, but not Notaries, are required to participate in a scheme organised by the profession to ensure so far as possible that people without sufficient resources are not prevented from pursuing or defending civil and criminal cases in the island's courts. The scheme is administered on behalf by the [[Bâtonnier]] (a senior member of the profession). Cases accepted by the Bâtonnier as eligible are allocated to lawyers on the basis of the 'Tour de Rôle' (i.e. according to one's turn). Depending on the litigants' income and assets, lawyers may work [[pro bono]] or charge a reasonable fee in accordance with published guidelines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Jersey Citizen's Advice Bureau|title=Legal Aid|url=http://www.cab.org.je/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=106&amp;Itemid=66}}&lt;/ref&gt; A lawyer assigned a legal aid case may choose to pay another lawyer to handle the case and several firms have established specialist legal aid departments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Harry|last=McRandle|title=Law firm stops taking legal aid divorce cases|publisher=Jersey Evening Post|date=5 November 2005|url=http://www.thisisjersey.com/2005/11/05/law-firm-stops-taking-legal-aid-divorce-cases/}}&lt;/ref&gt; There have been numerous and long-standing calls for reform of the present system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Ben|last=Quérée|title=Public should pay for legal aid, says Bailiff|publisher=Jersey Evening Post|date=14 September 2007|url=http://www.thisisjersey.com/2007/09/14/public-should-pay-for-legal-aid-says-bailiff/}}&lt;BR&gt;{{cite web|first=Andy|last=Sibcy|title=Taxpayers "may have to foot bill for legal aid"|publisher=Jersey Evening Post|date=12 September 2003|url=http://www.thisisjersey.com/2003/09/12/taxpayers-may-have-to-foot-bill-for-legal-aid/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Law reform ==
The Jersey Law Commission&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lawcomm.gov.je/ Jersey Law Commission]&lt;/ref&gt; was established by the [[States of Jersey]] in 1996 to keep Jersey [[Law commission|law under review]] and bring forward proposals for law reform.

The '''Madras Public Libraries Act''', subsequently renamed as the '''Tamil Nadu Public Libraries Act''', was enacted in [[Madras State]], India, in 1948. The act was the first of its kind to be enacted in India after independence. The [[Connemara Public Library]] became the first library to come under the purview of this act, as a "State central library". Subsequently, nine district libraries were added during the [[Five-Year plans of India#First Five-Year Plan, 1951–1956|Five year plan from 1951]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Panda|first=B. D.|title=Handbook of Public Library System|publisher=Anmol Publications |year=1993|page=115|isbn=9788170417736|oclc=36878321|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pPb9vQFKgI4C&amp;lpg=PA9&amp;dq=madras%20public%20library%20act&amp;pg=PA115#v=snippet&amp;q=madras%20public%20library%20act%201948&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; The act was enacted based on research and activity by [[S. R. Ranganathan]] and the [[Madras Library Association]]. Other [[States and territories of India|states]] have enacted public library acts modelled on the Madras Public Libraries Act.

==Background==
R. K. Bhatt has highlighted how free-to-access public library systems are a necessary adjunct to a developing society, with growing industrialisation and improving rates of literacy, and argues that legislation "is an essential need in any country because it puts the structure, management and finance of library systems on proper legal footing".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bhatt|first=Ramesh Kumar|title=History and Development of Libraries in India|publisher=Mittal Publications |location=New Delhi |year=1995|pages=114–116|isbn=978-81-7099-582-1|oclc=33162755|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Jbmdowzuv0QC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ranganathan recognised this. He had spent time training as a librarian in London around 1923 and was impressed by the system of public library legislation which existed there. Upon returning to India he began to campaign for something similar to exist in his own country. The situation was complicated by the existence of various types of government, including provinces which were administered by the British Raj and various States under the control of princes. The fruits of his research and consultations were presented at the First All India Educational Conference in 1930. This report included a proposed Model Library Act.&lt;ref name=Sardana2002pp383-387&gt;{{cite book |title=Libraries and information studies in retrospect and prospect: essays in honour of Prof. D. R. Kalia |volume=2 |first=Narasimha |last=Raju |editor-first=J.

Although some areas, such as [[Baroda]], had established public library systems prior to 1945,&lt;ref name=Malleshappapp389-390&gt;{{cite book |title=Libraries and information studies in retrospect and prospect: essays in honour of Prof. D.

This was followed in 1948 by the Madras Public Libraries Act, which became the first such Act to be passed in the newly independent republic of India. Acts for other areas, such as [[Kerala]] and [[Haryana]], followed and generally improved on the earlier legislation.&lt;ref name=Sardana2002pp383-387/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bhatt|first=Ramesh Kumar|title=History and Development of Libraries in India|publisher=Mittal Publications |location=New Delhi |year=1995|page=116|isbn=978-81-7099-582-1|oclc=33162755|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Jbmdowzuv0QC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to the Act, the principal library of Madras was the Connemara Public Library, which had opened in 1860 and became a public library in 1896. A small refundable deposit was required to use it but it was essentially free. It became the State Central Library in 1948 and, in 1981, a depository library.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Patel|first=Jashu|author2=Kumar, Krishan|title=Libraries and Librarianship in India|publisher=Greenwood Press|location=Westport, Connecticut|year=2001|pages=80, 97 |isbn=978-0-313-29423-5|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KXVrsPSzeNAC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Provisions==
The Madras Public Libraries Act provides for overall governance by a [[State Library Committee]], presided over by the incumbent Education Minister for the State. The committee comprises members from various walks of life, including representatives from universities and from the State Library Association, as well as a Secretary whose primary function is as assistant to the Director of Public Libraries (DPL). The latter role is assumed by the incumbent [[Director of Public Instruction]].&lt;ref name=Bhatt1995pp118-122&gt;{{cite book|last=Bhatt|first=Ramesh Kumar|title=History and Development of Libraries in India|publisher=Mittal Publications |location=New Delhi |year=1995|pages=118–120|isbn=978-81-7099-582-1|oclc=33162755|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Jbmdowzuv0QC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Revenue is obtained via a [[cess]], a tax which is collected by local administrative bodies such as the [[Nagar Palika]]s and [[Panchayat]]s. Those bodies remit the tax to their [[Local Library Association]] (LLA), which operates as an [[umbrella organisation]] at the mid-tier District administrative level. The rate of taxation is fixed in law but the LLA can request a higher rate if the State government agrees to it. The State government matches the funds generated by the cess. The LLA determines the conditions of entry to the libraries under its control.&lt;ref name=Bhatt1995pp118-122/&gt;&lt;ref name=Taher1994p97/&gt;

Cities with a population in excess of 50,000 must have a central library of their own and provisions exist for expansion to include branch libraries and other means of devolved access if demand should require such. In addition to libraries that are administered by the LLA, the Act provides for a register of other libraries. This is maintained by the DPL, who has the power to issue grants from State resources to those institutions listed. With the exception of the city of Madras, these grants cannot be less than the cess collected elsewhere.&lt;ref name=Bhatt1995pp118-122/&gt;

Further resources are obtained by a modification caused by the Act. The Press and Registration of Books Act of 1857 is amended such that a situation somewhat akin to [[copyright library|copyright libraries]] exists. All publishers within the State are required to provide five copies of their output to the State government, which in turn passes on four of those copies to the State Central Library.&lt;ref name=Bhatt1995pp118-122/&gt;&lt;ref name=Taher1994p97&gt;{{cite book |title=Librarianship and library science in India: an outline of historical perspectives |series=Concepts in communication informatics &amp; librarianship |volume=60 |first=Mohamed |last=Taher |publisher=Concept Publishing Company |location=New Delhi |year=1994 |page=97 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qRLXDBX5KzkC |isbn=978-81-7022-524-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Until various reorganisations of States, the Act applied to parts of what are now Andhra Pradesh and Kerala.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Libraries in India's national developmental perspective: a saga of fifty years since independence |first=Mohamed |last=Taher |publisher=Concept Publishing Company |location=New Delhi |year=2001 |page=331 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rQk5iINMD2IC |isbn=978-81-7022-842-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Librarianship and library science in India: an outline of historical perspectives |series=Concepts in communication informatics &amp; librarianship |volume=60 |first=Mohamed |last=Taher |publisher=Concept Publishing Company |location=New Delhi |year=1994 |page=131 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qRLXDBX5KzkC |isbn=978-81-7022-524-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Evolution==
Several perceived failings in the Madras Public Libraries Act have been addressed in subsequent Acts elsewhere. For example, the Hyderabad legislation, which later became the Andhra Pradesh Public Libraries Act, states that there should be a completely separate department of government to administer the libraries; that the head of the State Library Committee (in this case called the State Library Council) should be elected rather than defaulting to the portfolio of the current Education Minister; and that all local administrative areas should have their own library authority. Furthermore, the amount and extent of the cess collected was improved by extending the range of taxes upon which the surcharge was levied; and the government, through the State Library Council, has a duty to train the librarians.&lt;ref name=Bhatt1995pp118-122/&gt; A key strategy which was embodied in the Act was the formulation of a hierarchical system whereby the local libraries were connected to the District libraries and they, in turn, were connected to the State Central Library and the National Library. Centralised acquisition and resource sharing was envisaged. This strategy had formed a part of the [[Five-Year plans of India#Second Five-Year Plan.2C 1956.E2.80.931961|Second Five Year Plan]] but it appears not to have been enforced with any haste; Brahmanda Barua wrote in 1992 that throughout India "The network principle has nowhere been applied in organising the libraries."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=National policy on library and information systems and services for India: perspectives and projections |first=Brahmanda Pratap |last=Barua |publisher=Popular Prakashan |location=Bombay |year=1992 |pages=83, 88 |isbn=978-81-7154-730-2 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IBB8drHUz7YC |accessdate=2011-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bhatt believes that the Karnataka Public Libraries Act is the most adequate and best functioning in the evolution of such Acts, and notes that the lack of provision for a cess in the later Acts for Maharashtra and West Bengal are a significant failing. In the case of Karnataka, there is a State Library Authority which is presided over by the Minister for Education, and also a fully-fledged Department of Public Libraries and local administrative bodies. The cess applies to a wide range of taxes, including those on property and vehicles, and there is further funding in non-city areas as a consequence of the stipulation that the State government must give to the local bodies 3% of all revenues received from land taxes in their area. The financing of the State Library Authority is determined by the lower authorities and private libraries can request grants but are not automatically entitled to them.&lt;ref name=Bhatt1995pp118-122/&gt;

==Recent situation nationally==
By 2002 there had been a total of 12 public library acts in place, although two of those - for [[Hyderabad State|Hyderabad]] and Kolhapur - had been superseded due to changes in the administrative structure of those areas,&lt;ref name=Sardana2002pp383-387/&gt; and two others had not been enforced.&lt;ref name=Malleshappapp389-390/&gt; Narasimha Raju considered that these Acts had proved to be "by and large ineffective", due to a combination of poor financing, poor administrative structure and, in some States, the "lethargy and negative attitude" of their governments. Raju also identified problems with the rapidly changing face of technology and noted that most of the libraries were unable to adapt to developments in television, radio and video recording. The [[Indian Library Association]] had taken on the campaign to improve matters, principally by promoting new legislation to replace that which already existed and Raju noted that many believed legislation should exist for the entire country rather than being a piecemeal system.&lt;ref name=Sardana2002pp383-387/&gt; 

Despite only eight Acts being in force, all twenty-five States and seven [[Union Territory|Union Territories]] had a central library and 75% of the Districts, which are the next tier of administration, had a similar facility. While legislated areas such as [[Maharashtra]] (1967) relied on volunteers and development of free libraries from the core of an existing [[subscription library]] system, Tamil Nadu, [[Karnataka]] (1965) and [[Andhra Pradesh]] (1960) were thought by T. Malleshappa to be the most developed when quantified by density of libraries and percentage of the population who had free access.&lt;ref name=Malleshappapp389-390/&gt; D. B. Eswara Reddy, writing in the same publication, bemoaned the poor provision below District level, with 90% of the rural population not having access even to a reading room or [[circulating library]], let alone modern multimedia and computing technology. Despite legislation and theoretical targets, library facilities remained the preserve of the urban elite and, for example, in Andhra Pradesh most children in rural areas were first-generation literates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Libraries and information studies in retrospect and prospect: essays in honour of Prof. D.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6469">On October 17, 2005, [[National Basketball Association]] [[commissioner]] [[David Stern]] announced the implementation of a mandatory '''[[dress code]]''' for all NBA and [[NBA Development League]] players. This was especially noteworthy because the NBA became the first [[major professional sports league]] to implement such a rule, although [[National Hockey League]] rules state that a player is supposed to wear a jacket and tie to games and on charters if not told otherwise by the [[head coach]] or general manager.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Scott BurnsideNHLFollowArchive |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nhl/columns/story?id=2198862 |title=Dress code suits NHLers just fine - NHL - ESPN |publisher=Sports.espn.go.com |date=2005-10-20 |accessdate=2012-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; The dress code went into effect at the start of the [[2005–06 NBA season]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nba/news/story?id=2194537 |title=NBA adopts 'business casual' dress code - NBA - ESPN |publisher=Sports.espn.go.com |date=2005-10-18 |accessdate=2012-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Details of the dress code==
Stern's dress code stated that all players must dress in business or conservative attire while arriving and departing during a scheduled game, on the bench while injured, and when conducting official NBA business (press interviews, [[Charitable organization|charity]] events, etc.). The new dress code banned fashions most often associated with [[hip-hop culture]], specifically: jerseys, [[jeans]], hats, [[do-rags]], T-shirts, large [[jewelry]], sneakers and [[caulk boots]].&lt;ref name=ESPN&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nba/news/story?id=2195141 |title=Stern sure players will comply with dress code - NBA - ESPN |publisher=Sports.espn.go.com |date=2005-10-20 |accessdate=2012-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This particular clothing is not allowed to be worn by players to interviews, games (on and off the bench), charity events, or any other occasion affiliated with the NBA or the NBDL (now the [[NBA G League|G League]]).  Violators of the dress code are fined and may be suspended with repeat offenses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eskimo.com/~pbender/fines.html |title=NBA Fines and Suspensions |publisher=Eskimo.com |date= |accessdate=2012-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; The dress code was developed with the intention of combating image problems that have plagued the NBA in recent history.

Under current NBA dress regulations, if a player does not dress to participate in a game, he must dress in a manner suitable for a coach.  In the NBA, a suit or a [[sport coat]] is required for coaches,&lt;ref name=ESPN /&gt; as well as a [[necktie]].

==Supporting arguments==
The league's image was in bad shape following the [[Pacers–Pistons brawl]] in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nba/news/story?id=1927380 |title=Artest, Jackson charge Palace stands - NBA - ESPN |publisher=Sports.espn.go.com |date=2004-11-21 |accessdate=2012-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Supporters also claim that most [[business]]es require their employees to adhere to a dress code of some kind so the NBA is not making any unusual demands. Moreover, the NBA was not requiring players to wear a suit and tie, as had been rumored initially. Further, many NBA teams already had dress codes, as dictated by coaches or general managers. Penalties for non-compliance usually involved fines such as having to pay for one's own airfare to wherever the team was going, rather than flying on the team charter.

==Opposing arguments==
Critics such as [[Allen Iverson]], [[Stephen Jackson]] and [[Paul Pierce]] claim that the dress code will not change a person's [[moral character|character]] regardless of what type of clothing they wear, and that associating hip-hop style of dress with [[crime]] or a bad image is [[Racism|racist]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nba/news/story?id=2198089 | title=Richardson says dress code targets black players | publisher=[[ESPN]].com | work=[[Associated Press]] | date=October 19, 2005 | accessdate=February 1, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://seattletimes.com/html/sports/2002571873_nba20.html | title=NBA notebook: Dress code targets blacks, says Jackson | publisher=[[Seattle Times]] | date=October 20, 2005 | accessdate=February 1, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Iverson was also quoted to say, "the dress code is not who I am and doesn't allow me to express myself."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://bleacherreport.com/articles/490598-allen-iverson-last-of-a-dying-breed | title=Allen Iverson: Last of a Dying Breed | publisher=[[Bleacher Report]] | date=October 13, 2010 | accessdate=February 1, 2014 | author=Sawyer, Jameel}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many NBA and non-NBA sports figures also claim that it targets young black males and is a slap against [[hip-hop culture]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/10/22/AR2005102201386.html | title=Opinions on the NBA's Dress Code Are Far From Uniform | publisher=[[Washington Post]] | date=October 23, 2005 | accessdate=February 1, 2014 | author=Wise, Mike}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2005/writers/phil_taylor/10/12/taylor1012/index.html | title=Balancing act | publisher=[[SI.com]] | date=October 12, 2005 | accessdate=February 1, 2014 | author=Taylor, Phil}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most NBA players are sponsored by companies such as [[Nike Inc.|Nike]], [[Adidas]], [[Puma SE|Puma]] and [[Converse (shoe company)|Converse]].

==Impact==

Writing for ''[[Rolling Stone]]'', Zack Graham said that although players were initially critical of the dress code, "Over the years, NBA players accepted, then embraced and eventually began to have fun with the new dress code, changing men's fashion in the process."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.rollingstone.com/sports/features/david-sterns-nba-dress-code-legacy-w448591 | title = How David Stern's NBA Dress Code Changed Men's Fashion | date= 4 November 2016 | accessdate = 7 November 2016 | publisher = ''Rolling Stone'' | author = Zack Graham}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9617">The '''National Moot Court Competition''' is one of the oldest [[moot court]] competitions in the [[United States]]. Co-sponsored by the [[New York City Bar Association]] and the [[American College of Trial Lawyers]], the competition includes up to 191 teams from 124 law schools, who compete in regional competitions in November with the top two in each region advancing  to the national competition held in the landmark [[House of the New York City Bar Association]] in February.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nycbar.org/law-students/national-moot-court&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

[[File:2015 National Moot Court Competition Winners.jpg|thumb| left| 220px| Dane Shikman and Kyle Singhal (center) of the [[George Washington University Law School]] won the 2015 National Moot Court Competition, defeating [[Georgetown University]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;before a seven-justice bench.]]
The National Moot Court Competition was created in 1947 by [[Harrison Tweed]], then president of the New York City Bar Association, as part of a campaign to recruit younger members to the City Bar in the years following [[World War II]].

The first competition was held at the City Bar's building in January 1950. Twelve law school teams debated the legality of "rainmaking," or the use by farmers of rainmaking devices to divert water from adjacent land. The program was formatted as a mock appeal, in order to develop the skills of appellate advocacy among law students.&lt;ref&gt;"Fifty Years of Moot Court." ''44th Street Notes.'' February, 2001. p. 3. Published by the New York City Bar Association.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the years since, the moot court competition has expanded to include competitions in 15 regions throughout the continental United States.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nycbar.org/law-students/national-moot-court/competition-rules&lt;/ref&gt;  The cases argued traditionally focus on a timely issue arising under the [[United States Constitution]], in keeping with the competition's original theme of appellate advocacy. The final national competition continues to be held in New York, and the final argument between the top two teams is judged by a seven-person mock court, including prominent jurists, the president of the New York City Bar Association and the president of the American College of Trial Lawyers.

==Organization==
[[Image:Final Argument National Moot Court 2008.jpg|thumb|right| 250px| Judges of the 2008 competition during final arguments, from left to right: Mikel L. Stout; The Honorable Richard Andrias; The Honorable Julio M. Fuentes; Honorable Deanell Reece Tacha; The Honorable Theodore T. Jones, Jr.; The Honorable Roslynn Mauskopf; Barry M. Kamins]]

In both the regional and national competitions, all teams are required to argue the same single case on appeal. The case consists of two issues drawn from current legal issues that are likely to be considered by the Supreme Court in the near future. The cases are devised and prepared each year by the Young Lawyers Committee of the New York City Bar Association.

The National Moot Court Competition begins on the regional level. The United States is divided into fifteen regions, each of which hosts its own regional competition for teams whose law schools fall within their jurisdiction. Each fall, the New York City Bar Association invites all [[American Bar Association|ABA]]-accredited law schools to field moot court teams of two to three students to participate in regional competitions. 
The regional winners and runners-up compete in a four-day national competition, as the 30-team field narrows to sixteen, eight, four, two, and ultimately one champion over the course of the competition.

The best overall team is presented with the Fulton Haight Award,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.actl.com/Content/NavigationMenu/AboutUs/AwardsandCompetitions/NationalMootCourt/default.htm&lt;/ref&gt; which includes a trophy and a cash reward. The team presenting the best oral arguments is awarded the [[John W. Davis]] award, which includes an engraved silver cup. Best individual speaker and runner-up for best individual speaker are both awarded crystal obelisks by the American College of Trial Lawyers.

==Rules==

Every participating team is required to submit a brief in advance of the regional and (if they qualify to attend) national competitions.  At each competition, teams are required to argue both sides of their appeal. Competitors are judged 40% on written briefs, and 60% on oral presentation.  The Competition is administered by, and governed by Rules drafted by, the New York City Bar's Young Lawyers Committee.

==Notable Past Participants==

The National Moot Court Competition has attracted a prestigious roster of past judges and competitors. [[United States Supreme Court]] Justices [[Thurgood Marshall]], [[Potter Stewart]], [[Byron White]], [[William Rehnquist]], [[Ruth Bader Ginsburg]], [[Sandra Day O'Connor]], and [[Anthony Kennedy]] have all judged past final rounds. Other notable judges have included Hon. [[Barrington D. Parker]], Hon. [[Judith S. Kaye]], and Hon. [[Amalya Kearse]].

{{canon law}}
In the [[canon law (Catholic Church)|canon law]] of the [[Catholic Church]], '''obrogation''' is the enacting of a contrary law that is a revocation of a previous law.&lt;ref&gt;Della Rocca, ''Manual'', 69.&lt;/ref&gt; It may also be the partial cancellation or amendment of a law, decree, or legal regulation by the imposition of a newer one.

==Obrogation==
In the [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]], obrogation is the modification or repeal of a law in whole or in part by issuing a new law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Obrogate |work=[[Merriam-Webster Dictionary]] |publisher=Merriam-Webster.com. |accessdate=March 24, 2016 |url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/obrogate}}{{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=obrogate |work=[[Black's Law Dictionary]] |edition=7th |page=1104 |first1=Bryan A. |last1=Garner |authorlink1=Bryan A. Garner |publisher=[[West Publishing]] |location=St. Paul, Minnesota |year=1999 |isbn=0-314-22864-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[1983 Code of Canon Law]] governs here in Canon 53: {{quote|If decrees are contrary one to another, where specific matters are expressed, the specific prevails over the general; if both are equally specific or equally general, the one later in time&lt;ref name=Can53/&gt; obrogates ([[Ecclesiastical Latin|Latin]]: ''obrogat''&lt;ref&gt;Caparros ''et al.'', ''[[1983 Code of Canon Law]] Annotated'', canon 53 (pg. 66)&lt;/ref&gt; from ''obrogare''{{sfn|Black|Nolan|Connolly|1979|page=971}}) the earlier insofar as it is contrary to it.&lt;ref name=Can53&gt;[[1983 Code of Canon Law]], [http://www.intratext.com/IXT/ENG0017/_P6.HTM Canon 53], accessed 24 March 2016&lt;/ref&gt;}}

This canon incorporates Rule 34 in VI of the ''[[Regulae Iuris]]'': ''"Generi per speciem derogatur"'' or "The specific derogates from the general."&lt;ref&gt;Coriden ''et al.'', ''Commentary'', pg. 54 (commentary on canon 53).&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19178">'''Public Interest Litigation''' is directly filed by an individual or group of people in the [Supreme Court of India] and High Courts of India and judicial member. It was felt that their interests are undermined by the government .In such a situation, the court directly accepts the public interest litigation. It is a new legal horizon in which court of law can initiate and enforce action to serve and secure significant Public Interest Litigation.

==History==
{{See also|Constitution of India}}
In December 1979, [[Kapila Hingorani]] had filed a petition regarding the condition of the prisoners detained in the Bihar jail, whose suits were pending in the court. The special thing about this petition was that it was not filed by any single prisoner, rather it was filed by various prisoners of the Bihar jail. The case was filed in the [[Supreme Court of India|Supreme Court]] before the bench headed by Justice P.N.Bhagwati. This petition was filed by the name of the prisoner, Hussainara Khatoon, hence the petition came to be known as ''Hussainara Khatoon Vs State of Bihar''. In this case, the Supreme Court upheld that the prisoners should get benefit of free legal aid and fast hearing. Because of this case 40,000 prisoners, whose suits were pending in the court, were released from the jail. There after many cases like this have registered in the supreme court. It was in the case of SP Gupta vs  Union of India that the Supreme Court of India defined the term "public interest litigation" in the Indian Context.

The concept of Public Interest Litigation (PIL) is in consonance with the principles enshrined in [[Article 39A]] of the [[Constitution of India]] to protect and deliver prompt social justice with the help of law. Before the 1980s, only the aggrieved party could approach the courts for justice. After the [[Indian Emergency (1975–1977)|emergency era]] the high court reached out to the people, devising a means for any person of the public (or an NGO) to approach the court seeking [[legal remedy]] in cases where the public interest is at stake. Justice [[P.&amp;nbsp;N. Bhagwati]] and Justice [[V.&amp;nbsp;R. Krishna Iyer]] were among the first judges to admit PILs in court.&lt;ref name="pil"&gt;[http://www.legalserviceindia.com/articles/pil.htm PIL A Boon Or A Bane]&lt;/ref&gt; Filing a PIL is not as cumbersome as a usual legal case; there have been instances when letters and telegrams addressed to the court have been taken up as PILs and heard.&lt;ref name="let"&gt;[http://www.karmayog.org/pil/pil_10720.htm Introduction to Public Interest Litigation]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Supreme Court of India|The Court]] entertained a letter from two professors at the [[University of Delhi]] seeking enforcement of the constitutional right of inmates at a protective home in [[Agra]] who were living in inhuman and degrading conditions. In ''Miss Veena Sethi v. State of Bihar'', 1982 (2) SCC 583  : 1982 SCC (Cri) 511  : AIR 1983 SC 339, the court treated a letter addressed to a judge of the court by the Free Legal Aid Committee in [[Hazaribagh]], [[Bihar]] as a [[Writ|writ petition]]. In ''Citizens for Democracy through its President v. State of Assam and Others'', 1995 KHC 486  : 1995 (2) KLT SN 74  : 1995 (3) SCC 743  : 1995 SCC (Cri) 600  : AIR 1996 SC 2193, the court entertained a letter from Shri [[Kuldip Nayar]] (a journalist, in his capacity as President of Citizens for Democracy) to a judge of the court alleging [[human-rights]] violations of [[Terrorist and Disruptive Activities (Prevention) Act]] (TADA) detainees; it was treated as a petition under Article 32 of the [[Constitution of India]].&lt;ref&gt;Constitution of India&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Divine Retreat Centre Vs. State of Kerala and Others'' [AIR 2008 SC 1614&lt;/ref&gt;

==Frivolous PILs not permitted==
PIL is a ''rule of law'' declared by the courts of record. However, the person (or entity) filing the petition must prove to the satisfaction of the court that the petition is being filed for the public interest and not as a frivolous litigation for pecuniary gain. The 38th Chief Justice of India, [[S.&amp;nbsp;H. Kapadia]], has stated that substantial "fines" would be imposed on litigants filing frivolous PILs. His statement was widely welcomed, because the instance of frivolous PILs for pecuniary interest has increased; a bench of the high court has also expressed concern over the misuse of PILs. The bench has issued a set of guidelines it wanted all courts in the country to observe when entertaining PILs.

In a September 2008 speech, Prime Minister [[Manmohan Singh]] expressed concern over the misuse of PILs: “Many would argue that like in so many things in public life, in PILs too we may have gone too far. Perhaps a corrective was required and we have had some balance restored in recent times”.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}} In what may be a tool against frivolous PILs, the Union [[Ministry of Law and Justice (India)|Ministry of Law and Justice]] is preparing a law regulating PILs. Helping the ministry was former Chief Justice of India late P.&amp;nbsp;N. Bhagwati  who pioneered PIL. Justice [[V.&amp;nbsp;R. Krishna Iyer]], was also part of it till his death on  4 December 2014.

The judgment said: “This court wants to make it clear that an action at law is not a game of [[chess]]. A litigant who approaches the court must come with clean hands. He cannot prevaricate and take inconsistent positions”. Since the Amar Singh petition was vague, not in conformance with the rules of procedure and contained inconsistencies, the court did not explore his primary grievance (infringement of privacy). One positive outcome of the case was the court’s request that the government “frame certain statutory guidelines to prevent interception of telephone conversation on unauthorised requests”. In this case, [[Reliance Communications]] acted upon a forged request from police.

In ''Kalyaneshwari vs [[Union of India]]'', the court cited the misuse of public-interest litigation in business conflicts. A writ petition was filed in the [[Gujarat High Court]] seeking the closure of [[asbestos]] units, stating that the material was harmful to humans. The high court dismissed the petition, stating that it was filed at the behest of rival industrial groups who wanted to promote their products as asbestos substitutes. A similar petition was then submitted to the Supreme Court. The plea was dismissed, and the plaintiff was assessed a fine of  {{INR}} 100,000. The judgment read: “The petition lacks ''[[bona fide]]'' and in fact was instituted at the behest of a rival industrial group, which was interested in banning of the activity of mining and manufacturing of asbestos. A definite attempt was made by it to secure a ban on these activities with the ultimate intention of increasing the demand of cast and ductile iron products as they are some of the suitable substitute for asbestos. Thus it was litigation initiated with ulterior motive of causing industrial imbalance and financial loss to the industry of asbestos through the process of court”. The court stated that it was its duty in such circumstances to punish the petitioners under the Contempt of Courts Act; it must “ensure that such unscrupulous and undesirable public interest litigation be not instituted in courts of law so as to waste the valuable time of the courts as well as preserve the faith of the public in the justice delivery system”.

“By now it ought to be plain and obvious that this Court does not approve of an approach that would encourage petitions filed for achieving oblique motives on the basis of wild and reckless allegations made by individuals, i.e., busybodies”, a bench of Justices B.&amp;nbsp;Sudershan Reddy and S.&amp;nbsp;S. Nijjar observed in their judgment. The bench overturned an April 2010 [[Andhra Pradesh High Court]] decision, which set aside the services of a retired [[Indian Police Service]] (IPS) officer employed by the [[Tirumala Venkateswara Temple]]. The high court’s decision concerned a public-interest petition filed by S.&amp;nbsp;Mangati Gopal Reddy, who alleged in court that the former IPS officer was involved in the loss of “300 gold dollars” from the temple and should not continue in office. The Supreme Court found that the high court decided against the accused with little information about Reddy himself.

“The parameters within which PILs can be entertained have been laid down. The credentials, the motive and the objective of the petitioner have to be apparently and patently aboveboard. Otherwise the petition is liable to be dismissed at the threshold”, the judgment stated. As for why it is skeptical about a large number of PILs, the bench spoke for the Supreme Court when it said that the “judiciary has to be extremely careful to see that behind the beautiful veil of public interest an ugly private malice, vested interest and/or publicity-seeking is not lurking. This Court ([[Supreme Court of India]]) must not allow its process to be abused for oblique considerations by masked phantoms who monitor at times from behind”.

=== Importance of PIL ===
* Public interest litigation gives a wider description to the right to equality, life and personality which is guaranteed under part III of the Constitution of India.
* It has introduced some kinds of reliefs or remedies under the writ jurisdiction.
* It also functions as an effective instrument for changes in the society or social welfare.
* Through public interest litigation, any public or person can seek remedy on behalf of the oppressed class by introducing a PIL.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://intolegalworld.com/2017/10/24/pil-and-difference-between-pubilc-interest-litigation-and-private-interest-litigation/|title=PIL AND DIFFERENCE BETWEEN "PUBILC INTEREST LITIGATION" AND "PRIVATE INTEREST LITIGATION" - Into Legal World|work=Into Legal World|access-date=2017-12-07|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== PIL can be filed against govt only, not individuals===
A PIL may be filed against state government, central government, municipal authority not any private party. But, private person may be included in PIL as ‘Respondent’, after concerned of state authority. i.e. a private factory in Mumbai which is causing pollution then public interest litigation can be file against government of Mumbai, state pollution central board including that private factory of Mumbai.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://intolegalworld.com/2017/10/24/pil-and-difference-between-pubilc-interest-litigation-and-private-interest-litigation/|title=PIL AND DIFFERENCE BETWEEN "PUBILC INTEREST LITIGATION" AND "PRIVATE INTEREST LITIGATION" - Into Legal World|work=Into Legal World|access-date=2017-12-07|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Filing of PIL under article 32, 226 Constitution of India or section 133 Cr. P. C.===
The court must be satisfied that the Writ petition fulfils some basic needs for PIL as the letter is addressed by the aggrieved person, public spirited individual and a social action group for the enforcement of legal or Constitutional rights to any person who are not able to approach the court for redress. Any citizen can file a public case by filing a petition:
* Under Art 32 of the Indian Constitution, in the Supreme court.
* Under Art 226 of the Indian Constitution, in the High court.
* Under sec. 133 of the Criminal Procedure Code, in the court of Magistrate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://intolegalworld.com/2017/10/24/pil-and-difference-between-pubilc-interest-litigation-and-private-interest-litigation/|title=PIL AND DIFFERENCE BETWEEN "PUBILC INTEREST LITIGATION" AND "PRIVATE INTEREST LITIGATION" - Into Legal World|work=Into Legal World|access-date=2017-12-07|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Landmark PIL cases ===
* '''''Vishaka v. State of Rajasthan'''''
This case was against sexual harassment at work place, brought by Bhanwari Devi to stop the marriage of a one year old girl in rural Rajasthan. Five men raped her. She faced numerous problems when she attempted to seek justice. Naina Kapoor decided to initiate a PIL to challenge sexual harassment at work place, in this supreme court.

The judgement of the case recognized sexual harassment as a violation of the fundamental constitutional rights of '''Article 14''', '''Article 15 and Article 21'''. The guidelines also directed for sexual harassment prevention.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://intolegalworld.com/2017/10/24/pil-and-difference-between-pubilc-interest-litigation-and-private-interest-litigation/|title=PIL AND DIFFERENCE BETWEEN "PUBILC INTEREST LITIGATION" AND "PRIVATE INTEREST LITIGATION" - Into Legal World|work=Into Legal World|access-date=2017-12-07|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''''M. C. Mehta v. Union of India'''''
In this case, the court passed three landmark judgements and several orders against polluting industries which were more than 50,000 in the Ganga basin. The court shut down numerous industries and allowing them to reopen only after controlled pollution. At the end, millions of people escaped air and water pollution in the Ganga basin, including eight states in India.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://intolegalworld.com/2017/10/24/pil-and-difference-between-pubilc-interest-litigation-and-private-interest-litigation/|title=PIL AND DIFFERENCE BETWEEN "PUBILC INTEREST LITIGATION" AND "PRIVATE INTEREST LITIGATION" - Into Legal World|work=Into Legal World|access-date=2017-12-07|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== {{anchor|Empirical study on PIL results}} Study on the impact of PIL ==
According to a controversial study by social scientist Hans Dembowski, PIL has been successful in making official authorities accountable to NGOs. While Dembowski also found some effect at the [[Grassroots democracy|grassroots]] level, PIL cases dealing with major environmental grievances in the Kolkata [[urban agglomeration]] did not tackle underlying problems (such as inadequate town planning). Dembowski's book ''Taking the State to Supreme Court - Public Interest Litigation and the Public Sphere in Metropolitan India'' was originally published by [[Oxford University Press]] in 2001. The publisher, however, discontinued distribution because of [[contempt of court]] proceedings initiated by the [[Calcutta High Court]]. The author (who claimed he was never officially notified by the court) has republished the book online with German NGO [[Asia House (Essen)|Asia House]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.asienhaus.de/public/archiv/taking%20the%20state%20to%20court.pdf ''Taking the State to Court'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

=={{anchor|Arguments Against PIL}}Further considerations==
A [[Bench (law)|bench]] consisting  of Justices [[G.&amp;nbsp;S. Singhvi]] and [[Asok Kumar Ganguly]] pointed out that laws enacted for achieving the goals set out in the [[Preamble to the Constitution of India|Preamble to the Constitution]] were inadequate; the benefits of welfare measures embodied in the legislation had not reached millions of poor people, and efforts to bridge the gap between rich and poor did not yield the desired results.

Writing the judgment in a case concerning sewage workers, Justice Singhvi stated: “The most unfortunate part of the scenario is that whenever one of the three constituents of the state i.e., the judiciary issues directions for ensuring that the right to equality, life, and liberty no longer remains illusory for those who suffer from the handicap of poverty, illiteracy and ignorance, and directions are given for implementation of the laws enacted by the legislature for the benefit of the have-nots, a theoretical debate is started by raising the bogey of judicial activism or overreach”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Supreme Court Judgment on Scavengers working under the Delhi Jal Board (Civil Appeal No 5322 of 2011)|url=http://indiacurrentaffairs.org/supreme-court-judgement-on-scavengers/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The bench clarified that it was necessary to erase the impression on some that the superior courts, by entertaining PIL petitions for the poor (who could not seek protection of their rights), exceeded the unwritten boundaries of their jurisdiction. The judges said it was the duty of the judiciary (like that of the legislative and executive constituents of the state) to protect the rights of every citizen and ensure that all lived with dignity.

Such cases may be filed in the public interest when victims lack the capability to commence litigation, or their freedom to petition the court has been encroached. The court may proceed ''[[suo motu]]'', or cases can proceed on the petition of an individual or group. Courts may also proceed on the basis of letters written to them, or newspaper reports.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3482">A '''quasi-contract''' (or '''implied-in-law contract''' or '''constructive contract''') is a [[Legal fiction|fictional]] [[contract]] recognised by a court. The notion of a quasi-contract can be traced to [[Roman law]] and is still a concept used in some modern legal systems.

== History ==
In [[common law]] jurisdictions, the law of quasi-contract can be traced to the medieval [[form of action]] known as ''indebitatus assumpsit''. In essence, the plaintiff would recover a money sum from the defendant ''as if'' the defendant had promised to pay it: that is, ''as if'' there were a contract subsisting between the parties. The defendant's promise—their agreement to be bound by the "contract"—was implied by law. The law of quasi-contract was generally used to enforce [[Restitution in English law|restitutionary]] obligations.&lt;ref&gt;See generally, Sir John Baker, ''An Introduction to English Law History'' (4th ed)&lt;/ref&gt;

The form of action known as ''indebitatus assumpsit'' came to include various sub-forms known as the common money counts. The most important of these for the later development of the law of quasi-contract included: (i) actions for money had and received to the plaintiff's use; (ii) actions for money paid to the defendant's use; (iii) ''[[quantum meruit]]''; and (iv) ''quantum valebat''.&lt;ref&gt;See generally, Sir John Baker, ''An Introduction to English Legal History'' (4th ed)&lt;/ref&gt;

Quasi-contractual actions were generally (but not exclusively) used to remedy what would now be called [[unjust enrichment]]. In most common law jurisdictions the law of quasi-contract has been superseded by the [[Unjust enrichment|law of unjust enrichment]].&lt;ref&gt;See generally, Mitchell et al, ''[[Goff &amp; Jones|Goff &amp; Jones Law of Unjust Enrichment]]'' (8th ed, 2011); Carter et al, ''Mason &amp; Carter's Restitution Law in Australia'' (2nd ed, 2008); Graham Virgo, ''The Principles of the Law of Restitution'' (3rd ed, 2015)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Quasi-contract and contract ==
A quasi-contract was distinct from a contract implied in fact. 
* ''Contract implied in fact.'' A person's assent to be bound by an agreement can be expressed or implied. In the latter case, assuming the [[English contract law|requisite formalities]] for a valid contract are met, there is a perfectly normal contract. The only distinction between a contract arising by express agreement between two people and a contract implied-in-fact is that the latter was recognised by a court drawing inferences from facts proved at trial. When the plaintiff sued on either sort of contract, she was suing in the law of contract in respect of a consensually assumed obligation and her remedy for the defendant's breach was damages. 
* ''Quasi-contract''. In contrast, quasi-contract refers to situations in which a defendant is bound ''as if'' there were a contract. When the plaintiff sued on such a 'contract' by bringing an action of ''indebitatus assumpsit'', she was not enforcing some consensually assumed obligation, but rather an obligation imposed by law.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8395">In [[Parliamentary procedure|legislative procedure]], a '''rider''' is an additional provision added to a [[bill (proposed law)|bill]] or other measure under the consideration by a [[legislature]], having little connection with the subject matter of the bill.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/rider|title=Definition of RIDER|author=|date=|website=www.merriam-webster.com|accessdate=4 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Riders are usually created as a tactic to pass a controversial provision that would not pass as its own bill. Occasionally, a controversial provision is attached to a bill not to be passed itself but to prevent the bill from being passed (in which case it is called a [[wrecking amendment]] or [[poison pill#Politics|poison pill]]).

==United States==

=== Federal legislation ===
The use of riders is prevalent and customary in the Senate of the [[Congress of the United States]], as the Senate's rules of germaneness are much more tolerant than those of the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]]. In the House, riders are generally not allowed, as any amendment to a bill must deal with the substance of the bill under consideration.

Riders are most effective when attached to an important bill, such as an [[appropriation bill]], because to [[veto]] or postpone such a bill could delay funding to governmental programs, causing serious problems.

When the veto is an all-or-nothing power as it is in the [[United States Constitution]], the executive must either accept the riders or reject the entire bill. The practical consequence of the custom of using riders is to constrain the veto power of the [[executive branch|executive]].

The [[Line Item Veto Act of 1996]] was passed to allow the [[President of the United States]] to veto single objectionable items within bills passed by [[United States Congress|Congress]], but the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] struck down the act as [[Constitutionality|unconstitutional]] in ''[[Clinton v. City of New York]]''.

Riders may be unrelated to the subject matter of bills to which they are attached and are commonly used to introduce unpopular provisions. For example, a rider to stop [[net neutrality]] was attached to a bill relating to military and veteran construction projects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://voices.washingtonpost.com/posttech/2010/12/senator_kay_bailey_hutchison_r.html|title=Post Tech - Sen. Hutchison moves to block funds for FCC on net neutrality rules|author=|date=|website=washingtonpost.com|accessdate=4 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another rider has been the [[Hyde Amendment]] which since 1976 has been attached to [[Appropriations bill (United States)|Appropriation Bill]]s to prevent [[Medicaid]] paying for most [[abortions]]. Another was the [[Boland Amendment]] in 1982 and 1983 to restrict financing of the Contras in Nicaragua.

A recent notable example of a rider was in the [[Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010]]. An amended version of the [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act]] in 2010 that was signed into law by [[Barack Obama]] only one week before, the amended bill included a rider for the [[Student Aid and Fiscal Responsibility Act]], whose [[student loan]] reform was completely unrelated to the broader bill's primary focus on [[Health care reform in the United States|health care reform]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.opencongress.org/bill/111-h4872/text?version=rh&amp;nid=t0:rh:13783 Text of H.R.4872 as Reported in House: Health Care and Education Affordability Reconciliation Act of 2010 - U.S OpenCongress&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== State legislation ===
Riders exist at the state level as well.  For just one example,a 2005 bill in [[West Virginia]] that was primarily focused on limiting the number of members that cities can appoint to boards of parks and recreation unexpectedly included a rider that made the [[English language]] the official language of the state of West Virginia. Most members of the [[West Virginia Legislature]] did not realize that the rider had been entered into the bill until it had already passed both [[West Virginia House of Delegates|state]] [[West Virginia Senate|houses]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2005/apr/12/20050412-103016-1211r/|title=English as state language slipped into W.Va. bill|first=The Washington Times|last=http://www.washingtontimes.com|date=|website=washingtontimes.com|accessdate=4 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Then-West Virginia governor [[Joe Manchin]], although a personal supporter of the [[English-only movement]], promptly vetoed the bill due to a provision in the [[Constitution of West Virginia]] that [[Single-subject rule|limits bills to one topic]], which also makes riders ''[[de facto]]'' unconstitutional in West Virginia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/nation/2005-04-16-official-english_x.htm|title=USATODAY.com - W. Va. vetoes bill to make English its official language|author=|date=|website=usatoday30.usatoday.com|accessdate=4 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  To counteract riders, 43 of the 50 [[U.S. state]]s have provisions in their [[State constitution (United States)|state constitutions]] allowing the use of [[line item veto]]s so that the executive can veto single objectionable items within a bill, without affecting the main purpose or effectiveness of the bill.

==Europe==

=== France ===
The [[Constitutional Council of France]] has taken an increasingly hard view against riders, which it considers unconstitutional and contrary to the rules of procedure of the [[Parliament of France|parliamentary assemblies]]. In 1985 the Council started striking down amendment to laws because they were unrelated to the subject of the law.&lt;ref name="CC-amendement"&gt;Services of the [[Constitutional Council of France]], [http://www.conseil-constitutionnel.fr/conseil-constitutionnel/root/bank_mm/pdf/Conseil/droitamd.pdf État de la jurisprudence du Conseil constitutionnel sur le droit d'amendement]&lt;/ref&gt; Two special categories of riders merit mention: the "budgetary riders", attached to budget bills,&lt;ref name="CC-amendement"/&gt; and "social riders", attached to the budget bill for social security organizations,&lt;ref name="CC-amendement"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Les Cahiers du Conseil constitutionnel, Cahier n°&amp;nbsp;22, [http://www.conseil-constitutionnel.fr/conseil-constitutionnel/root/bank/download/2006-544DC-ccc_544dc.pdf Commentaire] de la [http://www.conseil-constitutionnel.fr/conseil-constitutionnel/francais/les-decisions/depuis-1958/decisions-par-date/2006/2006-544-dc/decision-n-2006-544-dc-du-14-decembre-2006.1016.html décision n° 2006-544 DC du 14 décembre 2006]&lt;/ref&gt; clauses that have no link to the budget or to the social security budgets, respectively.

=== Hungary ===
In 2005, the [[Constitutional Court of Hungary]] struck down the yearly national budget law in its entirety, because almost half of the paragraphs were not related to state fiscals at all, but modified 44 other existing pieces of legislation, which concerned health regulations, public education and foreign relations. This judicial ruling restricted the government's future options in bypassing due parliamentary debate and imposing certain reforms unilaterally.

=== United Kingdom ===
In some legislative systems, such as the [[British Parliament]], riders are prevented by the existence of the [[long title]] of a bill that describes the full purpose of the bill. Any part of the bill that falls outside the scope of the long title would not be permitted. However, legislators often bypass this limitation by naming a bill vaguely, such as by appending "and for connected purposes" to the name.

==Examples==
* [[Cybersecurity_Information_Sharing_Act|CISA Act]] (2015)
* [[REAL ID Act]] (2005)
* [[Illicit Drug Anti-Proliferation Act]] (2003)
* [[Lautenberg Amendment]]
* [[Hyde Amendment]]
* The rider "Confirmation of antitrust status of graduate medical resident matching programs" was attached to [[the Pension Funding Equity Act]] and gave the [[Association of American Medical Colleges]] a victory in the anti-trust case [[Jung v. Association of American Medical Colleges]].

:''See [[Rogation days]] for usage pertaining to the Christian calendar of the Western Church.''

In [[Constitution of the Roman Republic|Roman constitutional law]], '''''rogatio''''' is the term (from [[Latin]]  ''rogo'', "ask, place a question before") for a [[Bill (proposed law)|legislative bill]] placed before an [[Legislative Assemblies of the Roman Republic|Assembly of the People]] in ancient Rome. The ''rogatio'' procedure underscores the fact that the [[Roman senate]] could issue decrees, but was not a legislative or [[parliament]]arian body. Only [[SPQR|the People]] could pass legislation.&lt;ref&gt;[[Fergus Millar]], ''The Crowd in Rome in the Late Republic'' (University of Michigan Press, 1998), pp. 157–158 [https://books.google.com/books?id=YVBNzYQy5vYC&amp;pg=PA157&amp;dq=%22it+was+only+by+the+people+that+legislation+could+be+passed%22&amp;lr=&amp;as_drrb_is=q&amp;as_minm_is=0&amp;as_miny_is=&amp;as_maxm_is=0&amp;as_maxy_is=&amp;as_brr=0#v=onepage&amp;q=%22it%20was%20only%20by%20the%20people%20that%20legislation%20could%20be%20passed%22&amp;f=false online.]&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[Roman magistrate|magistrate]] with the right to summon the assembly could propose a bill (''rogatio legis''); the proposed laws themselves were ''leges rogatae''. A bill's proposer was its ''lator''; a supporter was an ''auctor''.&lt;ref&gt;Millar, ''The Crowd in Rome'' p. 26.&lt;/ref&gt; Discussions in the senate would contribute to the drafting of a bill, which would be published (''promulgare rogationem'', that is, ''[[promulgation|promulgatio]]'') three weeks or more before it was formally submitted to the assembly. During this period, citizens could discuss the bill and propose changes, or more rarely ask for its withdrawal, at informal sessions (''contiones''). After the bill had been brought before the assembly for the vote, it could no longer be modified.&lt;ref&gt;George Mousourakis, ''The Historical and Institutional Context of Roman Law'' (Ashgate, 2003), p. 182 [https://books.google.com/books?id=8qE1zFHyGXoC&amp;pg=PA182&amp;dq=rogatio&amp;lr=&amp;as_drrb_is=b&amp;as_minm_is=0&amp;as_miny_is=1990&amp;as_maxm_is=0&amp;as_maxy_is=2009&amp;num=100&amp;as_brr=3#v=onepage&amp;q=rogatio&amp;f=false online.]&lt;/ref&gt;

The legislator who introduced the bill asked ''Velitis iubeatis, Quirites?'' ("Citizens, are you going to approve and order?"&lt;ref&gt;Or, "Citizens, is it your will that you should order it?"&lt;/ref&gt;) and the people responded [[yea or nay]] without discussion. If a bill was withdrawn after the ''rogatio'' but before the vote was taken, it was usually because a [[tribune]] threatened to use his veto power against it, or less frequently because it proved unpopular among the ''[[plebs]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Andrew Lintott]], ''Judicial reform and land reform in the Roman Republic'' (Cambridge University Press, 1992), pp. 6–7 [https://books.google.com/books?id=bcc9AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA6&amp;dq=rogatio+OR+rogation+inauthor:Lintott&amp;lr=&amp;as_drrb_is=b&amp;as_minm_is=0&amp;as_miny_is=1990&amp;as_maxm_is=0&amp;as_maxy_is=2009&amp;num=100&amp;as_brr=3#v=onepage&amp;q=rogatio%20OR%20rogation%20inauthor%3ALintott&amp;f=false online.] Lintott believes [[Cicero]] exaggerates the extent to which the ''plebs'' could influence withdrawal.&lt;/ref&gt; If a bill was passed (''rogatio lata est''), it became a law (''[[Roman law|lex]]'') after the presiding magistrate made a formal announcement (''renuntiatio'') of the assembly's decision.

In the Early [[Roman Republic|Republic]], the senate had to approve the constitutionality of a law before it was enacted; after the passage of the ''[[Conflict of the Orders#The end of the Conflict of the Orders (367-287 BC)|Lex Publilia Philonis]]'' in 339 BC, which required that at least one of the two ''[[Roman censor|censores]]'' be a plebeian, this approval (''patrum [[auctoritas]]'') was required before the bill was put to a vote in the assembly. With controversial [[populares|popularist]] measures, however, the senate was sometimes bypassed. 
If a bill was proposed for the purpose of declaring war, it had to be brought before the [[Centuriate Assembly]].&lt;ref&gt;Fergus Millar, ''Rome, the Greek World, and the East'' (University of North Carolina Press, 2002), p. 116.&lt;/ref&gt;

A bill that became law was inscribed on copper or marble tablets and kept in the state treasury (''[[aerarium]] populi romani'') under the supervision of the [[quaestor]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Mousourakis, p. 183.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 63 BC, [[Cicero]] managed to [[Obstructionism|obstruct]] a ''rogatio Servilia'' by making a speech before the people; this appears to be the only time in the Late Republic when oratory blocked a popular piece of legislation, which in this case had provided for the distribution of land to the poor. Or so Cicero claims; the bill's sponsor, the tribune [[Servilius Rullus]], more likely withdrew it because of the threat of veto from one of his fellow tribunes, and it never reached the ''[[comitia]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Henrik Mouritsen, ''Plebs and Politics in the Late Roman Republic'' (Cambridge University Press, 2001), pp. 54–55 [https://books.google.com/books?id=8iQQ7Xe2y-wC&amp;pg=PA66&amp;dq=rogatio&amp;lr=&amp;as_drrb_is=b&amp;as_minm_is=0&amp;as_miny_is=1990&amp;as_maxm_is=0&amp;as_maxy_is=2009&amp;num=100&amp;as_brr=3#v=onepage&amp;q=rogatio&amp;f=false online.] Further discussion of the ''rogatio Servilia'' by [[Erich S.

'''Seal culling in South Australia''' was strongly advocated for in 2015 in response to increasing interactions of ''[[Arctocephalus forsteri]]'', the [[Indigenous (ecology)|indigenous ]] '''long-nosed fur seal''' (also known as the '''New Zealand fur seal'''), with the state's fishing industry. In the 19th century, both fur seals and Australian sea lions were hunted for their hides. During the 20th century, seals were sometimes culled on the assumption that they were competing with fishermen. As of 2018 seal culling is illegal, but remains a topic of public debate. All [[Pinniped|pinnipeds]] in South Australia remain fully protected under the ''[[National Parks and Wildlife Act 1972]]'' as listed Marine Mammals. As of 2016, there were an estimated 100,000 long-nosed fur seals in South Australian waters.

== History ==
Despite confusion stemming from its common name, the [[New Zealand fur seal]] (''Arctocephalus forsteri)'' is a [[pinniped]] native to South Australia. Efforts to overcome this confusion have led to increasing use of the common name, '''long-nosed fur seal'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = The long-nosed fur seal (Arctocephalus forsteri) in South Australia in 2013–14: abundance, status and trends|url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1071/ZO14103|journal = Australian Journal of Zoology|date = 2015-01-01|pages = 101–110|volume = 63|issue = 2|first = P. D.|last = Shaughnessy|first2 = S. D.|last2 = Goldsworthy|first3 = A. I.|last3 = Mackay|doi=10.1071/zo14103}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 1800-1899 ===
The species was heavily hunted by sealers in the early 1800s. Seals were clubbed to death by men who raided seal colonies and rookeries by boat, sometimes swimming ashore armed with clubs and knives. The sealers typically bludgeoned the animals to death and used knives to skin the carcasses. Pups were often killed along with their mothers or sometimes kept as pets. The hides of the slain seals were then pickled in brine and exported.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = SEAL HUNTING. BYGONE AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRY.|url = http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article32271038|newspaper = The West Australian|date = 6 April 1929|access-date = 2015-07-09|pages = 4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Seal hunting continued to occur in Gulf St. Vincent in the 1880s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = SOUTH AUSTRALIA. ADELAIDE, Thursday.|url = http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article150429320|newspaper = Geelong Advertiser|date = 12 February 1883|access-date = 2015-07-09|pages = 3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The colony of South Australia was only officially established in 1836, and as such, no baseline data exists for the South Australian seal population prior to the impact of hunting. Their population's gradual recovery, spanning the past century, has brought them into increasing conflict with the state's fishing industry.

=== 1900-1949 ===
The killing of seals in South Australian waters continued into the 20th century, on the assumption that they were in competition with fishermen.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = A SEAL THIEF.|url = http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article88732135|newspaper = Chronicle|date = 26 April 1913|access-date = 2015-07-09|pages = 14}}&lt;/ref&gt; 7,000 to 8,000 were estimated to have been killed in the six months prior to August 1918. One man alone, Mr S. H. Sheridan of Glenelg admitted to having killed 1,430 seals during this period on the islands of [[Spencer Gulf]].&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite news|title = OUR SEALS. Are They Doomed?.|url = http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article60373647|newspaper = The Register|date = 23 August 1918|access-date = 2015-07-09|pages = 5}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Samuel Albert White|Captain S. A. White]], an "ardent nature lover", said of calls that seals should be killed for allegedly competing with fishermen:&lt;blockquote&gt;"It is not the seals, poor creatures, but that ever destructive being, man, who has created the dearth [of fish]. It is high time the Governments of this country let a glimmer of natural science into their deliberations, and not go for advice to those who are fighting against nature and bringing dire consequences upon their heads."&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;White estimated that prior to the European colonisation of South Australia, hundreds of thousands of seals likely inhabited its waters.

In 1929, ''The Advertiser'' reported that men had been landing on islands in Spencer Gulf and "molesting seals." At this time the animals were protected under the ''Animals and Bird Protection Act''. It was prohibited "for any person to land on Dangerous Reef with a gun or a dog, or to take seals on any of the islands or reefs within St. Vincent or Spencer Gulf north of a line from [[Cape Catastrophe]] to [[Cape Borda]], continued to [[Cape Hart Conservation Park|Cape Hart]] at the south-eastern corner of [[Kangaroo Island]], thence to the mouth of the [[Murray River|River Murray]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = SEALS IN SPENCER GULF|url = http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article73783494|newspaper = The Advertiser|date = 1929-11-26|access-date = 2015-08-05|pages = 23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Seals were known to enter inland river systems and were seen as far up the Murray-Darling system as [[Deniliquin]], 1,000 miles from the mouth of the Murray. A hotel at [[Conargo]] once displayed the skin of a seal shot in the river nearby.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = FRESHWATER SEALS|url = http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article139561517|newspaper = Western Grazier|date = 1943-01-08|access-date = 2015-08-05|pages = 2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other accounts of inland seal sightings prior to 1933 include at [[Tyntynder]], [[Pental Island, Victoria|Pental Island]], [[Echuca]] and near [[Swan Hill]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = Nature Notes and Queries Inland Seals|url = http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article11720775|newspaper = The Argus|date = 1933-12-15|access-date = 2015-08-05|pages = 5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other sighting locations include Loxton and Mildura.

In 1940 some fishermen claimed to have suffered damage to their nets which they attributed to seals. The Chief Inspector of Fisheries and Game at the time suspected that some of the damage had not been done by seals, but rather by sharks. At this time, fishermen in the neighboring state of [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] were allowed to shoot seals which interfered with their fishing efforts or equipment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = FISHERMEN CANNOT SHOOT SEALS IN MOST S.A.

=== 1950-1999 ===
In 1954, W. W. Jenkins suggested in Parliament that an open season should be called to keep seal numbers in check.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article164351913|title=M.P. SUGGESTS OPEN SEASON FOR SEALS|last=|first=|date=1954-11-12|work=|newspaper=Victor Harbour Times|access-date=2015-08-15|via=Trove}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fisherman A. W. Lundstrom wrote that before the barrages were built across the River Murray, seals were often seen near the town of [[Goolwa, South Australia|Goolwa]].&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article47627403|title=Habits Of Seals To The Editor|date=6 November 1954|newspaper=The Advertiser|access-date=2015-07-09|pages=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Construction of the barrages began in 1935 and they were completed in 1940.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.murrayriver.com.au/about-the-murray/barrages/|title=Goolwa Barrages, South Australia near Murray Mouth &amp; Coorong|website=murrayriver.com.au|accessdate=2015-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lundstrom, acting as President of the Southern Fishermen's Association wrote of the seals:&lt;blockquote&gt;"We as fishermen still maintain that the seal is a menace to the fishing industry in the same way as the [[rabbits]], [[dingoes]] or [[kangaroos]] are to the landholder."&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;At the time, three fishermen in the Victor Harbor area had permission to shoot seals which interfered with their fishing nets. One of them, Mr A. J. Jenkins called for an "open season" on seals, stating:&lt;blockquote&gt;"We want the seals' sanctuary on [[The Pages|the islands]] abolished and a continuous open season declared so these pests may be destroyed at their breeding grounds."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = SEALS HAPPY ON ISLAND OFF VICTOR|url = http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article130974895|newspaper = News|date = 4 November 1954|access-date = 2015-07-09|pages = 17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;The article in which Jenkins is quoted also claimed that seals consumed up to {{convert|40|lb}} of fish each day. In a written reply, A. Keith Minchin, Director of Adelaide's Koala Farm, called the claim "a colossal exaggeration" and wrote that even a large seal would consume less than {{convert|12|lb}} of fish daily.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = Habits Of Seals To The Editor|url = http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article47600654|newspaper = The Advertiser|date = 13 November 1954|access-date = 2015-07-09|pages = 4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1967 it was alleged that fishermen were harpooning seals and dolphins in South Australian waters and using the meat as crayfish bait. The claim was refuted by Mr. Thompson, a government fisheries inspector. Thompson stated that permits to cull seals could be made available, and had been previously when net damage caused by seals had been demonstrated. At the time such permits were to be issued "only when deemed absolutely necessary."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = Seals Not Used for Cray Bait|url = http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article187329777|newspaper = Victor Harbour Times|date = 1967-01-20|access-date = 2015-08-05|pages = 7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1984, Australian sea lions were reportedly responsible for damaging the nets of fishermen near Victor Harbor. Fishermen's applications for permits to kill the animals were rejected due to the species' low population.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = Fish feast for seals is costly|url = http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article185633660|newspaper = Victor Harbour Times|date = 1984-03-14|access-date = 2015-08-05|pages = 9}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2015, the Australian sea lion remains an endangered species.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Neophoca cinerea (Australian Sealion, Australian Sea Lion)|url = http://www.iucnredlist.org/details/14549/0|website = iucnredlist.org|accessdate = 2015-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 2000-present ===
The southern bluefin tuna ranching industry was established in the early 1990s and reported increasing interactions with fur seals in the 2010s. This led the industry to seek permission to kill seals that they claim they can recognise.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.samuseum.sa.gov.au/media/unlocked/kangaroo-island-seal-survey|title=South Australian Museum - Kangaroo Island Seal Survey|last=|first=|date=2013-01-09|website=www.samuseum.sa.gov.au|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-01-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Marcus Stehr, son of [[Hagen Stehr]] and executive of the Stehr Group told ''The Advertiser'' in 2012 that fur seal interactions were costing their [[southern bluefin tuna]] ranching aquaculture business "at least $1 million" annually. He stated:&lt;blockquote&gt;"Seals cost the entire industry millions of dollars every year and we do need support from the State Government to look at how we manage them. In SA we have failed to develop any strategies to manage growing seal numbers and it's vital that this begins."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;In 2013 [[Brian Jeffriess]] told ''The Advertiser'':&lt;blockquote&gt;"Attacks by seals are a major problem for tuna ranching. They are the largest cause of tuna deaths in the pontoons and frighten the other tuna so they do not eat for days."&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;In 2013 ''The Advertiser'' reported that New Zealand fur seals ate an average of 4.5 kilograms of marine species each per day. At that time the state population was estimated at over 85,000 animals.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Fur seals devastating marine eco-system|url = http://www.adelaidenow.com.au/news/south-australia/fur-seals-devastating-marine-ecosystem/story-fni6uo1m-1226687806768|accessdate = 2015-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, Dr Brad Page told the ABC that the population had reached 100,000 animals. He also stated that most of the fur seals' diet consists of [[red bait]] and [[Nototodarus gouldi|arrow squid]], and not species which are typically caught and sold for human consumption.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Seals wreak havoc in South Australia|url = http://www.abc.net.au/pm/content/2015/s4223423.htm|date = 2015-04-24|accessdate = 2015-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2014, two decapitated New Zealand fur seals were found in [[Louth Bay]], southern [[Spencer Gulf]]. The circumstances of their death were regarded as suspicious.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Headless seals found on beach treated as suspicious|url = http://www.abc.net.au/news/2014-08-25/headless-seals-discovered-in-sa/5693974|website = ABC News|accessdate = 2015-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2015, the prospect of seal culling in South Australia became a subject of increasing public debate and controversy. Mounting frustration among fishermen has led some to admit that they will consider taking action themselves in order to protect their livelihoods. A seal was also killed at Murray Bridge after being hit by a boat during a ski-racing event. Approximately five seals were seen in the area, and the event was cancelled after the animal was hit. Its injuries were assessed by a local vet who then euthanized the seal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Seal killed during ski racing|url = https://au.news.yahoo.com/video/watch/28370261/seal-killed-during-ski-racing/#page1|accessdate = 2015-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2015, fishermen from the Lower Lakes and Coorong region reported that fur seals had damaged their fishing nets.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Aggressive seals attacking rare birds, pelicans and fishing nets, SA fishermen warn|url = http://www.abc.net.au/news/2015-04-24/fur-seals-attack-rare-birds-pelicans-fishing-nets-coorong-lower/6418046|website = ABC News|accessdate = 2015-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2015, Narrinjeri elder and fisherman Darrell Sumner admitted to having killed at least four seals and injuring another. He threatened to kill more animals in the future, and believes that the seals are killing pelicans- his people's totem animal. The Narrinjeri believe that pelicans embody the spirits of their dead ancestors,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Aboriginal elder threatens cull of booming Coorong seal population if Govt doesn't intervene|url = http://www.abc.net.au/news/2015-08-05/aboriginal-elder-threatens-cull-of-booming-coorong/6674366|website = ABC News|accessdate = 2015-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has said that he doesn't care that killing or hurting the animals is an illegal act under "white man's law".

Fishermen believe that seals are competing with wild catch fisheries, and have reported net damage that they claim was caused by fur seals. [[Southern bluefin tuna]] ranchers have reported stock losses at their seacage aquaculture operations. Regions in which claims have been made that fur seals are impacting fisheries and aquaculture businesses include: Kangaroo Island, the [[Lake Alexandrina (South Australia)|Lower lakes]] and Coorong, and southern [[Spencer Gulf]].

== Status ==
A spokesperson for the Environment Department of the [[Government of South Australia]] told ''[[The Advertiser (Adelaide)|The Advertiser]]'' in 2012:&lt;blockquote&gt;"The Government does not support culling, sterilisation or relocation of NZ fur seals in SA. Attempts interstate and overseas to manage seal populations through culling, sterilisation or relocation have proven resource-hungry and largely ineffectual and any benefit received from relocating a small number of seals would likely be lost due to the influx of new seals."&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Kangaroo Island may cull New Zealand fur seals to save penguins|url = http://www.adelaidenow.com.au/news/kangaroo-island-may-cull-new-zealand-fur-seals-to-save-penguins/story-e6frea6u-1226347635430|accessdate = 2015-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;In April 2016, South Australia's environment minister Ian Hunter reaffirmed the Government's position stating "the best available science" showed a cull "would not work". He told ''The Advertiser'' that the Government was instead "focusing our resources on measures to reduce the impact of long nosed fur seal populations, including trialing different nets and underwater cracker deterrents.”&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.adelaidenow.com.au/news/south-australia/federal-mp-jamie-briggs-joins-call-for-seal-cull-after-witnessing-massacre-of-fairy-penguins/news-story/74166569ac708de1134d04ebc4c864f4|title=Federal MP Jamie Briggs joins call for seal cull after witnessing ‘massacre’ of fairy penguins|last=Williams|first=Tim|date=2016-04-03|work=|newspaper=The Advertiser|access-date=2016-04-03|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Advocates for culling ==
[[File:Jamie Briggs.jpg|alt=Jamie Briggs|thumb|[[Jamie Briggs]]]]

Culling seals in South Australian waters has been advocated for most strongly by fishermen and aquaculture operators who claim that their businesses have suffered as a result of the population's recovery.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Proposal to cull 'mongrel' fur seals in South Australia criticised|url = http://www.abc.net.au/news/2015-07-02/plan-to-cull-mongrel-fur-seals-in-south-australia-criticised/6590166|website = ABC News|accessdate = 2015-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other advocates include Liberal Party politicians,&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; conservative newspaper columnist and Liberal member [[Nicolle Flint]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Nicolle Flint: Why it's time to kill our killer feral seals|url = http://www.adelaidenow.com.au/news/opinion/nicolle-flint-why-its-time-to-kill-our-killer-feral-seals/story-fni6unxq-1227431122375|website = adelaidenow.com.au|accessdate = 2015-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = The Paranoid Case For ABC Bias {{!}} newmatilda.com|url = https://newmatilda.com/2013/05/15/paranoid-case-abc-bias|website = newmatilda.com|accessdate = 2015-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; a penguin tour operator in Kangaroo Island and their supporters.

The owner of the Kangaroo Island Penguin Centre, John Ayliffe has advocated for the culling of fur seals on Kangaroo Island, which he believes have impacted [[little penguin]] colonies, and therefore his business.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Fur seals taking over - penguins, pelicans, tuna and fish at risk|url = http://www.theislanderonline.com.au/story/3187920/fur-seals-taking-over-penguins-pelicans-tuna-and-fish-at-risk/?cs=12|accessdate = 2015-07-08|first = The|last = Islander}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Politicians advocating for the commencement of a cull have included [[Liberal Party of Australia|Liberal Party]] MPs [[Adrian Pederick]],&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; [[Michael Pengilly]]&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; and [[Jamie Briggs]].&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

== Opposition to culling ==
[[File:Robert Brokenshire 3.jpg|alt=Robert Brokenshire|thumb|[[Robert Brokenshire]]]]

Dr Peter Shaughnessy of the South Australian Museum advised that the culling of seals in South Australia would be a bad idea.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; Political opposition to the culling of seals in South Australia has been demonstrated by [[animal rights activists]], including [[Animals Australia]] and the Seals of Nam. Both organisations have created petitions encouraging people to sign and express their opposition to any future cull.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Say NO to South Australia's seal slaughter bill!|url = http://www.animalsaustralia.org/take_action/save-south-australian-seals|website = animalsaustralia.org|accessdate = 2015-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Seal Hunt Petitions - The Seals of Nam|url = http://www.thesealsofnam.org/seal-hunt-petitions/|accessdate = 2015-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Australian Greens]] MLC [[Tammy Franks]] has spoken out against culling, along with the [[Humane Society International]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

While [[Family First Party|Family First]] politician [[Robert Brokenshire]] has been critical of the Government's "do nothing" approach, he has also expressed concern over the impact that seal culling could have on the State's reputation and tourism industry. He told the ABC:&lt;blockquote&gt;"Some people have called for culling, now the reality is that we can't do that. It would just damage our economy, it would ruin our tourism."&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Culling in other Australian states ==
SA Shark Industry spokesman Kyri Toumazos suggested that a permitting scheme for seal culling operates in [[Tasmania]].&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; According to the Tasmanian government, all seals in Tasmanian waters are protected. In response to the question "Do seals threaten fisheries?" the Tasmanian government has stated:&lt;blockquote&gt;"Some fishermen complain about seals, accusing them of taking all their fish. Occasionally fishermen suggest that seals should be culled and that this will increase fish stocks and there will then be more available for human consumption. However, closer examination of seal-fishery interactions at the ecosystem level suggests that removing or culling seals may in fact be detrimental to fish stocks rather than beneficial. Remove a top predator and the whole system runs the risk of collapse."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Living with Seals|url = http://dpipwe.tas.gov.au/wildlife-management/living-with-wildlife/living-with-seals|website = dpipwe.tas.gov.au|accessdate = 2015-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In legal terms, the '''right of substitution''' is a [[statutory]] right of all parties except the [[Sovereign state|state]].  It is the right to change the [[judge|presiding court official]] with or without [[Bias|cause]].

Judges are usually given cases randomly within a [[jurisdiction]] (unless there is only one judge in a jurisdiction, in which case they receive all cases).  The right of substitution does not give a [[litigant]] the right to choose a judge, just the random selection of another judge in the jurisdiction.  If the right is exercised in a jurisdiction with one judge usually a judge from a neighboring jurisdiction will take the case, although on occasion a [[Reserve Judge]] or [[Commissioner]] may be used.

==Right of substitution with cause==
{{Main|Judicial disqualification}}
The right of substitution, where applicable, may be exercised by [[Criminal law|criminal]] and [[juvenile (law)|juvenile]] [[defendants]] and all parties in a [[civil action]].  Substitution for cause can be for any bias a judge may have in the case, such as an association with a party (family, friendship or even stock ownership), having made vocal comments in the past on the topic at trial, etc.  

The right of substitution with cause does not have a limitation on the number of times it may be called for, such that parties may exercise the right until they find a neutral judge.  Substitution with cause may be moved for at any time after a party realizes a bias exists.  However many jurisdictions require the right be exercised within a certain time after the bias has been discovered by a party or else the right will be [[Waiver|waived]], often 30–60 days.

This right rarely must be exercised by parties, as judges will usually raise the bias {{lang|la|[[sua sponte]]}} and [[recuse]] him or herself from a case before a party may even have known of the [[conflict of interest]]. 

==Right of substitution without cause==

The right of substitution without cause is only applicable in some US States and not in the [[United States federal courts|federal court system]].  It is uncommon outside the United States.  This right may only be used once per case whereas the right of substitution for cause may be used until a neutral judge can be found.

Substitution without cause must be [[Motion (legal)|moved for]] prior to the first order by a judge.  It can therefore be moved for in [[Civil procedure|civil court]] after [[complaint]]s and [[answer (law)|answer]]s have been filed but prior to the first order, often a scheduling order for [[discovery (law)|discovery]] procedure.  In criminal or juvenile courts the right may be exercised after [[arraignment]] or [[indictment]] but before a [[preliminary hearing]].  Sometimes the motion must be made a certain number of days before the "prelim" or scheduling order is held.

{{Positive criminology sidebar}}
'''Therapeutic jurisprudence''' ("'''TJ'''") studies law as a social force (or agent) which inevitably gives rise to [[unintended consequences]], which may be either beneficial (therapeutic) or harmful (anti-therapeutic).  These consequences flow from the operation of legal rules or legal procedures—or from the behavior of legal actors (such as lawyers and judges). TJ researchers and practitioners typically make use of social science methods and data to study the extent to which a legal rule or practice affects the psychological well-being of the people it affects, and then explore ways in which anti-therapeutic consequences can be reduced, and therapeutic consequences enhanced, without breaching due process requirements.&lt;ref&gt;David B Wexler, Michael L Perlin, Michel Vols et al. 'Editorial: Current Issues in Therapeutic Jurisprudence' (2016) 16(3) ''QUT Law Review'' pp. 1-3. ISSN: Online- 2201-7275 https://lr.law.qut.edu.au/article/view/692/616&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early development==

The term was first used by Professor [[David B. Wexler|David Wexler]], of the [[University of Arizona]] Rogers College of Law and [[University of Puerto Rico]] School of Law, in a paper delivered to the [[National Institute of Mental Health]] in 1987. Constance Backhouse, a leading legal historian from Canada, has published a biography of Wexler and his work.&lt;ref&gt;Constance B. Backhouse, An Introduction to David Wexler, the Person Behind Therapeutic Jurisprudence, 2016, http://ssrn.com/abstract=2747488&lt;/ref&gt; Along with Professor [[Bruce Winick]] of the [[University of Miami School of Law]], who developed the area with Wexler, these law professors suggested the need for a new perspective, TJ, to study the extent to which substantive rules, legal procedures, and the role of legal actors ([[lawyers]] and [[judge]]s primarily) produce therapeutic or antitherapeutic consequences for individuals involved in the legal process. 
In the early 90’s, legal scholars began to use the term when discussing mental health law, including Wexler in his 1990 book Therapeutic Jurisprudence: The Law as a Therapeutic Agent, and  Wexler and Winick in their 1991 book, ''[[Essays in Therapeutic Jurisprudence]]''.  The TJ Approach soon spread beyond mental health law to include TJ work in [[criminal law]], family and juvenile law, health law, [[tort law]], contracts and commercial law, trusts and estates law, disability law, constitutional law, evidence law, and legal profession.  In short, TJ became a mental health approach to law generally.&lt;ref&gt;Wexler and Winick, 1996, Law in a Therapeutic Key: Developments in Therapeutic Jurisprudence.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;David B. Wexler, The Development of Therapeutic Jurisprudence: From Theory to Practice, 68 Revista Juridica Universidad de Puerto Rico 691-705 (1999).&lt;/ref&gt;

The approach was soon applied to the way various legal actors—[[judge]]s, [[lawyers]], [[police officers]], and [[psychologists and criminal justice professionals]]—play their roles, suggesting ways of doing so that would diminish unintended antitherapeutic consequences and increase the psychological well-being of those who come into contact with these legal figures.  In 1999 in a Notre Dame Law Review article&lt;ref&gt;Hora, Schma and Rosenthal, “Therapeutic Jurisprudence and the Drug Treatment Court Movement: Revolutionizing the Criminal Justice System’s Response to Drug Abuse and Crime in America,” 74 NDLR 439 (1999)&lt;/ref&gt; TJ was applied to [[drug court|drug treatment courts]] (DTC) for the first time and the authors asserted that DTCs were TJ in action and that TJ provided the jurisprudential underpinnings of DTCs.  TJ has emerged as the theoretical foundation for the increasing number of "problem-solving courts" that have transformed the role of the judiciary.  These include, in addition to DTCs, domestic violence courts, [[mental health courts]], re-entry courts, teen courts, and community courts.&lt;ref&gt;Winick and Wexler, 2003, Judging in a Therapeutic Key: Therapeutic Jurisprudence and the Courts.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some countries embraced the TJ movement more than others: particularly the United States where it originated, as well as Canada,  Australia and New Zealand, with England slower until recently,  while nevertheless developing some problem-solving courts.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=wz9lDxCz3iIC The International Problem-Solving Court Movement] James L. Nolan, Princeton University Press, 31 Mar 2009, pg 77&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, TJ concepts have entered  into the systems of various other countries, such as Israel, Pakistan,&lt;ref&gt;[http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1917748 Therapeutic Jurisprudence and Legal Education in Pakistan: A Quest for Innovation in Study of Law to Mend Attitudes of Law Professionals Towards Litigants] Muhammad Amir Munir, Pakistan Law Journal, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; India, and Japan. Now, the field is fully international and robust, as evidenced by the recent launch of the International Society for Therapeutic Jurisprudence&lt;ref&gt; https://www.intltj.com&lt;/ref&gt;, a society with a comprehensive and authoritative website.

==Reframing roles==

Therapeutic Jurisprudence also has been applied in an effort to reframe the role of the [[lawyer]].  It envisions lawyers practicing with an ethic of care and heightened interpersonal skills, who value the psychological well being of their clients as well as their legal rights and interests, and to actively seek to prevent legal problems through creative drafting and problem-solving approaches.&lt;ref&gt;Stolle, Wexler, and Winick, 2000, Practicing Therapeutic Jurisprudence: Law as a Helping Profession.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wexler, Rehabilitating Lawyers: Principles of Therapeutic Jurisprudence for Criminal Law Practice (Carolina Academic Press 2008).&lt;/ref&gt;  TJ also has begun to transform legal education, in particular clinical legal education.&lt;ref&gt;2005 symposium issue of the St. Thomas University Law Review, "Therapeutic Jurisprudence and Clinical Legal Education and Skills Training."&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mainstreaming==
Traditionally, TJ was closely associated with problem-solving courts, such as drug treatment courts, because such courts were designed to invite the use of TJ practices (such as procedural justice, judge-client personal interaction, demonstration of empathy, active listening, and the like). Many desire the expansion of problem-solving courts, but for a number of reasons, especially economic ones, expansion on a large scale seems unlikely; in fact, in some jurisdictions, economic factors have even led to the elimination of such courts.  For these and other reasons, a current interest on the part of many TJ scholars and proponents is to "mainstream" TJ—that is, to try to apply TJ practices and principles in "ordinary" courts, especially in criminal, juvenile, and perhaps family matters.

In order to mainstream TJ, a first analytical step is to see to what extent existing provisions of current codes are "friendly"to TJ—that is, whether their legal structure is sufficient to permit the introduction of TJ practices. If so, educational programs should be instituted to discuss how the law may be implemented in a more therapeutic manner. If not, a discussion would be necessary about the desirability and feasibility of [[legal reform]]. The analytical methodology in use here employs the metaphor of "wine" and "bottles", where the TJ practices and techniques are the wine and the governing legal structures are the bottles.&lt;ref&gt;http://ssrn.com/abstract=2065454&lt;/ref&gt; The mainstreaming project is facilitated by a Blog entitled ''Therapeutic Jurisprudence in the Mainstream''.&lt;ref&gt;http://mainstreamtj.wordpress.com/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Related concepts==

Therapeutic jurisprudence has been described as a subset of [[legal psychology]], meaning the scientific study of mind and behavior as it affects or is affected by the law. As well, the term [[psychological jurisprudence]] has been used to describe study of the law as it is affected by and affects mind and behavior.&lt;ref&gt;[https://litigation-essentials.lexisnexis.com/webcd/app?action=DocumentDisplay&amp;crawlid=1&amp;srctype=smi&amp;srcid=3B15&amp;doctype=cite&amp;docid=37+St.+Louis+L.J.+675&amp;key=6c8796ba634acfaf00723789e42cea27 Legal Psychology and Therapeutic Jurisprudence] Mark A. Small, Saint Louis University Law Journal, Spring 1993, 37&lt;/ref&gt; Another related concept is [[restorative justice]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://guides.lib.monash.edu/content.php?pid=293490&amp;sid=3419721#12224305 Non-Adversarial Justice: Resources for alternative dispute resolution, restorative justice, therapeutic jurisprudence and commercial arbitration] Retrieved March 2014&lt;/ref&gt; The fields of [[forensic psychology]] and [[forensic psychiatry]] also operate at the juncture of law and the mind.

The idea that the law can have a therapeutic role should not be confused with any idea that psychological therapies should be attempted to be used for legal ends (such as coercion) rather than clinically for clinical reasons. TJ theorists have also warned against the legal system uncritically accepting psychological experts and theories, and to not allow legal issues to masquerade as clinical ones if they are not.

Coming from the opposite direction, a related approach now dubbed 'jurisprudent psychology' (originally therapy) looks at whether psychological interventions are conducted fairly and consistently with legal concepts of justice.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=Zg_h5H4fr1QC&amp;pg=PA51&amp;lpg=PA51 Criminal Mental Health and Disability Law, Evidence and Testimony: A Comprehensive Reference Manual for Lawyers, Judges, and Criminal Justice Professionals] John Parry, American Bar Association, 1 Jan 2009, pg 49-&lt;/ref&gt;

Therapeutic jurisprudence is also linked to the [[positive criminology]] perspective,&lt;ref&gt;Wexler, D. B. (2013). Getting and giving: What therapeutic jurisprudence can get from and give to positive criminology. ''Arizona Legal Studies.'' Retrieved from http://ssrn.com/abstract=2220509&lt;/ref&gt; which is a conceptual approach to criminology that places an emphasis on social inclusion and on forces at individual, group, social and spiritual levels that are associated with the limiting of crime.

The '''Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981''' is an [[Act of Parliament]] in the [[United Kingdom]] implemented to comply with European Council [[Birds Directive|Directive 2009/147/EC on the conservation of wild birds]]. In short, the act gives protection to native species (especially those at threat), controls the release of non-native species, enhances the protection of [[Site of Special Scientific Interest|Sites of Special Scientific Interest]] and builds upon the rights of way rules in the [[National Parks and Access to the Countryside Act 1949]]. The Act is split into 4 parts covering 74 sections; it also includes 17 schedules.

The legislation has strength; few amendments have been made to it, and it has acted as a foundation for later legislation to build upon. The compulsory 5 year review of schedules 5 and 8 make it dynamic in terms of the species which it protects.

== History ==

===Wild Birds Protection Act 1902===

The '''Wild Birds Protection Act 1902''' ([[2 Edw 7]] c. 6) was an [[Act of Parliament]] of the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]], given the royal assent on 22 July 1902 and repealed in 1954.

It provided that where any person was convicted of an offence against the Wild Birds Protection Acts 1880 to 1896 (the 1880, 1881, 1894 and 1896 Acts), the court was empowered to dispose of any bird or bird's egg in respect of which the offence had been committed.&lt;ref&gt;''The Public General Acts Passed in the Second Year of the Reign of His Majesty King Edward the Seventh''. London: printed for His Majesty's Stationery Office. 1902.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Chronological table of the statutes''; HMSO, London. 1993.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Act was repealed and replaced by the [[Protection of Birds Act 1954]]. '''Bird Sanctuary Orders''' (BSOs) under this Act were replaced by '''Areas of Special Protection''' (AoSPs) under the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jncc.defra.gov.uk/page-1527|title=Protected areas designations directory|publisher=Joint Nature Conservation Committee|accessdate=2 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Birds Directive===
The 1979 [[Bern Convention on the Conservation of European Wildlife and Natural Habitats]] covered the [[natural heritage]] of Europe, as well as in some African countries. It encouraged European co-operation in protecting natural habitats; and the conservation of flora and fauna, including migratory species and particularly [[endangered species]].

The convention became open for signature on 19 September 1979 as a binding international legal instrument; it came into force on 1 June 1982. The UK ratified the convention and adopted the European Directive on the Conservation of Wild Birds (among other directives).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.coe.int/t/dg4/cultureheritage/nature/bern/default_en.asp Bern Convention on the Conservation of European Wildlife and Natural Habitats], Council of Europe, (2011) [Accessed: 24 March 2011]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[European Directive 79/409/EC]] on the Conservation of Wild Birds was adopted on 2 April 1979. The main provisions included: protection of vulnerable species; classification of [[Special Protection Areas]], protection for all wild birds; and restrictions on killing/selling/keeping wild birds.&lt;ref&gt;JNCC, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1981 several acts have passed as UK legislation to comply with the European Directive on the Conservation.&lt;ref&gt;JNCC, 2010a&lt;/ref&gt; The Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 strengthened protection of SSSIs introduced by the [[National Parks and Access to the Countryside Act 1949]]. The pre-dated acts:
*Protection of Birds Acts of 1954, 1964 and 1967
*[[Conservation of Wild Creatures and Wild Plants Act 1975]]
:were repealed by the passing of the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981.
:&lt;ref&gt;Naturenet, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

'''1982'''- The Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 was implemented.

'''1985'''- The UK ratified the Bonn [[Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals]] (1979).  Adopted in Bonn, Germany in 1979 and coming into force in 1985, the Bonn Convention worked to conserve migratory species and their habitats. Listed in Appendix I are species which are endangered, Appendix II contains species which would benefit from international cooperation.

Appendix 1 migratory species listed in the convention were amended into the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981.

Further UK legislation to comply with the European Directive on the Conservation include:
*Wildlife (Northern Ireland) Order 1985
*Nature Conservation and Amenity Lands Order 1985
*Conservation Regulations 1995
*Offshore Marine Conservation Regulations 2007
*Conservation Regulations 2010

== Regulators ==

===Regulated by Natural England===

As well as being a regulator of the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981, Natural England acts as an advisor (to individuals, companies, government, etc.) in relation to nature conservation. Additionally Natural England helps with land management through grants, projects and information.

Legally responsible for [[Site of Special Scientific Interest|Sites of Special Scientific Interest]] (SSSIs) and enforce law when necessary. Damage, destruction or disturbance of SSSI habitats and features can lead to the following actions by Natural England:

*information- awareness and education can stop harmful activities&lt;ref name="naturalengland2007"&gt;[http://www.english-nature.org.uk/Special/sssi/images/EnforcementPolicyNotice.pdf SSSI Enforcement Policy], Natural England, (2007) [Accessed: 23 March 2011].
&lt;/ref&gt;
*warning letters- request harmful activity to stop and request agreement for restoration&lt;ref name="naturalengland2007"/&gt;
*formal investigations- collection of evidence by trained investigators following legal evidence requirements&lt;ref name="naturalengland2007"/&gt;
*cautions- if prosecution is not an appropriate action then a caution is issued if necessary evidence has been collected (to have a good chance of conviction)&lt;ref name="naturalengland2007"/&gt;
*prosecution- only occurs when evidence collected makes conviction reasonably certain or where prosecution is in the public interest. Natural England always try to recover costs and publicise prosecutions to the press. Specific penalties are applied, consideration of profit gained from offence is considered and often added to fines, application for a formal restoration order is made making the offender responsible for restoration of SSSI (at offender's expense).&lt;ref name="naturalengland2007"/&gt;
*civil action- in most serious cases where all other options have been explored, Natural England can take civil action to claim possession of SSSIs under serious threat.&lt;ref name="naturalengland2007"/&gt;

===Regulated by Countryside Council of Wales and Scottish Natural Heritage===

Similar responsibilities to Natural England, but responsible in Wales and Scotland.

===Regulated by the police===

Within the police there are several aspects to regulating wildlife crime; intelligence, enforcement and prevention.&lt;ref&gt;IEEM, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

The police are responsible for enforcing part I of the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981, often advised by Natural England&lt;ref name="naturalengland2007"/&gt; and will investigate wildlife offences; usually performed by wildlife crime officers (WCOs).

The [[National Wildlife Crime Unit]] (NWCU) is a law enforcement unit which helps agencies with enforcement. Wildlife crime investigations, statistics and intelligence are provided.

===Regulated by the Environment Agency===

The [[Environment Agency]] deal with reports from the public in relation to wildlife crime; under duties to prosecute environmental crimes, offences such as damage to habitats and wildlife are included. The EA work closely with the RSPB and wildlife crime officers.&lt;ref name="environmentlaw2010"&gt;[http://www.environmentlaw.org.uk/rte.asp?id=206 Regulators and Agencies], Environmentlaw, (2010) [Accessed: 27 March 2011]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Regulated by local authorities===

Local authorities (e.g. Southampton City Council) are responsible for regulating public rights of way and enforcing rights of way legislation.&lt;ref name="legislation2010"/&gt; Issues such as obstructions and misleading signs are usually reported by members of the public and then are dealt with by the local authority.&lt;ref name="southamptoncitycouncil2009"&gt;[http://www.southampton.gov.uk/s-environment/rightsofway/maintenance.aspx Maintaining Public Rights of Way], Southampton City Council, (2009) [Accessed: 27 March 2011]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Monitored by===

*Regulatory bodies (mentioned above).
*NGOs; the RSPB and RSPCA work with the police to prevent and identify wildlife crime.&lt;ref name="environmentlaw2010"/&gt;
*General public.
*The [[Partnership for Action against Wildlife Crime]] (PAW)- a multi-agency body which encourages both statutory and NGO organisations to work together in the combat of wildlife crime.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.defra.gov.uk/paw/ Partnership for Action Against Wildlife Crime], Defra, (2011) [Accessed: 27 March 2011]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Offences ==

===Land owners and occupiers===

===Exemptions===

'''Exemptions to Part 1- Wildlife'''

There are various exemptions applied to part one providing protection for wildlife, thus no lawful act or offence will be committed, if:

*an authorised person for example by obtaining a licence from Natural England or DEFRA kills or takes a wild bird, damages or destroys the nest of a bird and damages or removes eggs from the nest.
*an authorised person for example has obtained a licence for killing or injuring an animal in schedule 5 and can provide sufficient evidence stating it was necessary to prevent damage and protect livestock, crops, vegetables, fruit, growing timber and fisheries.
*a wild bird or animal has been taken if injured and that  person’s intention is to tend and return the bird or animal to the wild when fully recovered. If it is so severely injured beyond recovery then it can be killed in the most humane way possible.

All sick and injured birds and animals which are being cared for must be registered with DEFRA.

*it can be shown that the destruction of a nest, egg, bird, animal or an animal’s shelter was accidental from a lawful operation and could not have been avoided.
*an individual can provide evidence showing it was necessary to kill or injure a protected animal or bird in order to protect livestock, crops, vegetables, fruit, growing timber and fisheries.&lt;ref name="legislation2010"/&gt;
