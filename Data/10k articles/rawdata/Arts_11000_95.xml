== History ==
Operating through more than a dozen subsidiaries, AECOM traces its origins to Kentucky-based [[Ashland Inc.|Ashland Oil &amp; Refining Company]], which in turn grew out of Swiss Drilling Company, founded in Oklahoma in 1910 by J. Fred Miles. He gained control of some 200,000 acres and formed Swiss Oil Company in Lexington. In 1924 Miles launched a refining operation called Ashland Refining Company, headed by Paul Blazer. While the parent company struggled, leading to the ouster of Miles, Ashland prospered under Blazer's leadership, and in 1936 he was named chief executive officer of the reorganized company, [[Ashland Inc.|Ashland Oil &amp; Refining Company]]. In 1966 Ashland acquired Warren Brothers and became involved in highway construction and construction materials. The company was able to take advantage of refinery byproducts to produce asphalt. Ashland grew into one of the nation's major road-construction firms, and laid a foundation for AECOM. Through a series of acquisitions and technological developments prior to the buyout, Ashland grew to include chemical, petrochemical, highway construction, and construction materials firms within its realm, laying the groundwork for the management buyout of Ashland Technology in 1985.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.marketwatch.com/story/engineering-firm-aecom-bulks-up-eyes-ipo|title=Aecom IPO back on after four-year wait|date=24 January 2007|publisher=Marketwatch|accessdate=2 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1970s Ashland Oil &amp; Refining became Ashland Oil, Inc. Five years later the company consolidated its construction assets into a construction division and also formed a coal subsidiary, indicative of a changing focus at Ashland. Although it generated more than $1 billion a year in sales, Ashland was a small player in the oil industry at a time when the cost of exploration was prohibitively expensive. By 1980 Ashland sold its production assets, and a year later was reorganized as a modified holding company. A new corporate strategy was implemented as Ashland now focused on refining and marketing, and sought to grow its non-refining businesses. In 1984 Ashland acquired Daniel, Mann, Johnson &amp; Mendenhall (DMJM), a global provider of transportation-related engineering services. Originally focused on military projects, after World War II it had become one of the first integrated engineering and architectural firms in the western United States. The acquisition of DMJM also included its president, [[Richard G. Newman]], AECOM's future chief executive and chairman. In 1985 DMJM became part of a new subsidiary, Ashland Technology Corporation. Two years later Newman was named its new president.&lt;ref name="AECOM Technology Corporation - Company Profile, Information, Business Description, History, Background Information on AECOM Technology Corporation"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.referenceforbusiness.com/history2/12/AECOM-Technology-Corporation.html |title=AECOM History, Date Dec 13, 2007 |publisher=referenceforbusiness.com |accessdate=Feb 16, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When Ashland chose to return to its core petroleum refining business in the late 1980s, Newman recommended an employee buyback proposal, resulting in the spin-off of Ashland Technology and the creation of AECOM (Architecture, Engineering, Consulting, Operations, and Maintenance) in 1990. The company went on to acquire a number of engineering, design and planning firms including engineering company [[Maunsell]], urbanism and sustainability practice [[EDAW]], Economic Research Associates (ERA), environmental management firm ENSR and The RETEC Group Inc., architects [[Ellerbe Becket]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bizjournals.com/kansascity/stories/2009/10/26/daily2.html|title=AECOM Technology buys Ellerbe Becket|date=26 October 2009|publisher=Biz Journals|accessdate=2 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Davis Langdon]], the quantity surveyors and construction consultants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aecom.com/News/_news/AECOM+completes+Davis+Langdon+acquisition+in+Australia,+New+Zealand,+Europe,+Middle+East,+United+States |archive-url=https://archive.is/20131127110108/http://www.aecom.com/News/_news/AECOM+completes+Davis+Langdon+acquisition+in+Australia,+New+Zealand,+Europe,+Middle+East,+United+States |dead-url=yes |archive-date=November 27, 2013 |title=AECOM corporate website - press release on Davis Langdon merger |publisher=AECOM |year=2013 |accessdate=November 13, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

EDA is also an acronym for Excellent Dynamic Activism.&lt;ref name=eda-awards&gt;{{cite web|title=EDA Awards|url=http://awfj.org/eda-awards-2/|publisher=AWFJ|accessdate=9 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; These awards have been reported on in recent years by a number of mainstream media sources including ''[[Time (magazine)|TIME]]'', ''[[USA Today]]'', and ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'', and are also included in ''[[The New York Times]]''{{'}} movie reviews awards lists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Women film journalists hail 'Zero Dark Thirty,' Bigelow|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/movies/2013/01/08/alliance-of-female-journalists-zero-dark-thirty-kathryn-bigelow/1817081/|work=USA Today|accessdate=28 May 2013|first1=Susan|last1=Wloszczyna|date=8 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Bad Boy: Adam Sandler Vehicle Is Named to Misogyny ‘Hall of Shame’|url=http://entertainment.time.com/2013/01/08/bad-boy-adam-sandler-vehicle-is-2012-movie-named-to-misogyny-hall-of-shame/|publisher=TIME|accessdate=28 May 2013|date=8 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=‘Zero Dark Thirty’ tops Alliance of Women Film Journalists kudos|url=https://variety.com/2013/film/news/zero-dark-thirty-tops-alliance-of-women-film-journalists-kudos-1118064320/|publisher=Variety Media LLC|accessdate=28 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The Diving Bell and the Butterfly (2007)|url=https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/395604/The-Diving-Bell-and-the-Butterfly/awards|work=The New York Times Company|accessdate=28 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, AWFJ released a [http://awfj.org/2007/06/25/awfjs-top-100-films-list/ Top 100 Films List] in response to the [[American Film Institute]] revision of their [[AFI's 100 Years...100 Movies|100 Years, 100 Films]] list.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Alliance of Women Film Journalists' Top 100 Films|url=http://www.buzzsugar.com/Alliance-Women-Film-Journalists-Top-100-Films-346444|accessdate=28 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The AWFJ created their list to see if their members would come up with a substantially different list from AFI.

'''''An Ancient Burial Mound by Raklev on Refsnæs'''''is a Danish landscape painting by [[Johan Thomas Lundbye]] from 1839. The painting is executed in the national romantic tradition, as advocated by [[Niels Laurits Høyen]].

In the foreground of the painting's central motif, a [[Tumulus|barrow]]. The painting uses this very prominent figure, a giant mound that pushes the image background back to give great depth to the painting.

'''Architectural painting''' (also '''Architecture painting''') is a form of [[Genre art|genre painting]] where the predominant focus lies on architecture, both outdoors views and interiors. While architecture was present in many of the earliest paintings and illuminations, it was mainly used as background or to provide rhythm to a painting. In the Renaissance, architecture was used to emphasize the perspective and create a sense of depth, like in [[Masaccio]]'s ''[[Holy Trinity (Masaccio)|Holy Trinity]]'' from the 1420s.

In Western art, architectural painting as an independent genre developed in the 16th century in Flanders and the Netherlands, and reached its peak in 16th and 17th century Dutch painting.&lt;ref name=Muller&gt;{{cite book|last1=Muller|first1=Sheila D.|title=Dutch Art: An Encyclopedia|date=2013|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781135495749|page=20|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZPhLoy0FICMC&amp;pg=PA21 |chapter=Architectural painting}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Fredericksen|first1=Burton B.|title=Masterpieces of Painting in the J. Paul Getty Museum: Second Edition|date=1988|publisher=Getty Publications|isbn=9780892361373|page=21|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xg8WAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, it developed in a tool for Romantic paintings, with e.g. views of ruins becoming very popular. Closely related genres are architectural fantasies and trompe-l'oeils, especially [[illusionistic ceiling painting]], and [[cityscape]]s.

==Western artists specialized in architectural painting==

===16th century===
[[File:Hans Vredeman de Vries - Architectural Landscape - WGA25387.jpg|thumb|''Architectural landscape'' by [[Hans Vredeman de Vries]], now in the [[Hermitage Museum]]]]
The 16th century saw the development of architectural painting as a separate genre in Western art. The main centers in this period were Flanders and the Netherlands. The first important architectural painter was Dutch [[Hans Vredeman de Vries]] (1527-1607), who was both an architect and a painter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Waagen|first1=Gustav Friedrich|title=Handbook of Painting: The German, Flemish, and Dutch Schools.|date=1860|publisher=John Murray|page=245|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YatRAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA245 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Students of Hans Vredeman de Vries, both in Flanders and in the Netherlands, include his sons Salomon and Paul, and [[Hendrik van Steenwijk I]]. Through them the genre was popularized and their family and students turned it into one of the main domains of [[Dutch Golden Age painting]].

'''''Blood in the Face''''' is a 1991 [[documentary film]] about [[white supremacy]] groups in North America. It was directed by Anne Bohlen, [[Kevin Rafferty]] and [[James Ridgeway]]. It features many interviews with various white supremacist leaders, and archival footage of others.

==Production details==
''Blood in the Face'' was inspired by a nonfiction book by author James Ridgeway, who is also credited as one of the film's directors. This documentary was largely shot in [[Cohoctah Township, Michigan]]. It focuses on a gathering of [[neo-Nazi]]s, [[racist]]s, and [[conspiracy theorist]]s who expect [[people of color]] to ignite a [[Racial Holy War]] in the U.S.

Filmmakers Anne Bohlen and Kevin Rafferty take an intentionally leisurely, conversational tack with supremacists who have assembled for lectures and workshops on everything from getting their message out via home videos to moving all like-minded "[[Christian Identity|white Christians]]" to the Northwest, especially the [[Idaho Panhandle]].

According to the audio commentary on the [[Roger &amp; Me]] DVD, [[Academy Award]]-winning American filmmaker [[Michael Moore]] appears as an off-screen interviewer because he was originally contacted to arrange a meeting between the filmmakers and the supremacists since he had previously interviewed them for a magazine.  At the last minute, the filmmakers backed out of the interview and Moore stepped in to conduct it.  Moore is thanked in the end credits.

Michael Moore does appear on camera during one interview, and can be heard during another interview.

The '''Book League of America, Inc.''' was a [[United States|US]]  [[Book publishing|book publisher]]  and [[mail order]] [[book sales club]]. It was established in 1930, a few years after the [[Book of the Month Club]].&lt;ref name="nytimes" /&gt; Its founder was [[Lawrence Lamm]], previously an editor at [[Macmillan Publishers (United States)|Macmillan]].&lt;ref name="nytimes" /&gt; The company was located at 100 [[Fifth Avenue]], [[New York City]], [[New York (state)|New York]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.profitfrog.com/small-business/chapter-9.htm |title=Book Clubs |accessdate=2008-08-06  |publisher=Profitfrog.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; in a {{convert|240000|sqft|m2|adj=on}} office building that was constructed in 1906.&lt;ref name="therealdeal"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://therealdeal.com/newyork/articles/atlas-flips-100-fifth-avenue-for-152m|title=Atlas flips 100 Fifth Avenue for $152M|date=February 21, 2008|work=therealdeal.com|publisher=The Real Deal Online|accessdate=28 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; It [[Publishing#Printing|printed]] and  [[Publishing#Distribution|distributed]] a variety of volumes in the 1920s, 1930s, 1940s, and 1950s. A victim of the [[Great Depression]],&lt;ref name="nytimes" /&gt; the Book League of America was purchased by [[Doubleday (publisher)|Doubleday]] in 1936.

==Products==
Book League of America printed and published contemporary and classic books.  The clothbound [[hardcover]] was commonly a dark navy-blue, though sometimes red or black.  There was an embossed logo on the front.  Depending upon a variety of exposure conditions and perhaps publishing years, the spine cloth faded differently, with some of the spines remaining dark navy, while others turned purple or navy-green.  The spine featured book title and author in gold or silver [[Gilding|gilt]] lettering, along with decorative scrolling, sometimes in an [[art deco]] motif.

Most of the pages were smooth-cut on the top and bottom edges, and [[deckle]]d on the outer edge.  Some books contained the note: "This book is standard length, complete and unabridged.  Manufactured under wartime conditions in conformity with all government regulations controlling the use of paper and other materials."  This explains the yellowed or tanning paper condition, more noticeable in some books than others.  Some books were illustrated. Many of the books did not include a publish date.  [[Dust jacket]]s were not included.

==Services==
Approximately 5,000 [[Subscription business model|subscribers]] received monthly [[Flyer (pamphlet)|fliers]] that offered a selection from a variety of contemporary and [[Classic book|world classic literature]] choices.&lt;ref name="nytimes"&gt;{{cite news |first=Lawrence |last=Van Gelder |title=Lawrence Lamm, 99, Pioneer in Book Packaging |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1995/08/30/obituaries/lawrence-lamm-99-pioneer-in-book-packaging.html |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=1995-08-30 |accessdate=2008-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;   
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"The famous Board of Editors selects for you 2 books each month: the best new book -AND- one of the greatest classics.  The Book League of America supplies these 2 books each month at 1/3 of the usual cost!&lt;ref name="tias"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tias.com/cgi-bin/showcase-item.cgi?itemKey=1923062207&amp;store=/stores/mspackratz |title=1930s - The Book league of America ad |accessdate=2008-08-06 |publisher=tias.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Some books, published by other companies but carrying the Book League of America [[imprint (trade name)|imprint]], were included in the club sales offerings.  These publishers included:

'''C. R. Makepeace &amp; Company''', established in 1889, was a nationally active firm of mill architects based in [[Providence, Rhode Island]]. It was dissolved in 1944.

==Charles R. Makepeace==
Founder Charles R. Makepeace was born in [[Fayetteville, North Carolina]] on May 20, 1860. He attended [[Duke University]], then known as Trinity College, but left without graduating in 1880. He then worked on a number of cotton mills in [[Randolph County, NC|Randolph County]], before eventually making his way to [[Rhode Island]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hpo.ncdcr.gov/nr/CO0753.pdf Edenton Cotton Mill Historic District NRHP Nomination]. 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; He first practiced as a member of D. M. Thompson &amp; Company in Providence. When David M. Thompson left the partnership to manage mills for [[Benjamin Knight|B. B.]] &amp; [[Robert Knight (industrialist)|R. Knight]], Makepeace formed a new partnership, [[Hall &amp; Makepeace]], with established architect [[Clifton A. Hall]]. This lasted from 1884 to 1886. Hall was prominent as both a designer of industrial buildings as well as those that normally made up an architect's practice. 

In 1886 Makepeace left, and opened his own office.&lt;ref name="Monkhouse"&gt;Jordy, William H. and Christopher P. Monkhouse. ''Buildings on Paper: Rhode Island Architectural Drawings, 1825-1945''. 1982.&lt;/ref&gt; He established C. R. Makepeace &amp; Company in 1889.&lt;ref&gt;''American Elite and Sociologist Bluebook''. Ed. Thomas William Herringshaw. Chicago: American Blue Book, 1922.&lt;/ref&gt; Circa 1892 he made his designer, Charles A. M. Praray, a partner.&lt;ref name="Praray"&gt;''Fibre and Fabric'' 19 March 1898: 52. Boston.&lt;/ref&gt; He added new associates when Praray left in 1898. Makepeace's son, the MIT-trained C. Salisbury Makepeace, joined the office in 1916, upon graduating.&lt;ref&gt;''Technology Review'' Nov. 1916: 969. Cambridge.&lt;/ref&gt; 
==Later history==
After Makepeace's death in 1926, the company was presumably managed by C. Salisbury Makepeace. Henry A. McClean purchased the firm in 1928, and managed it until 1944, when it was dissolved. McClean died in [[West Warwick, RI|West Warwick]] in 1950.&lt;ref&gt;''Engineering News-Record'' 14 Sept. 1950: 67. New York.&lt;/ref&gt; C. Salisbury Makepeace died in August 1949.&lt;ref&gt;''Phillips Bulletin'' Winter 1950: 22. Andover, MA.&lt;/ref&gt;
==Charles A. M. Praray==
Charles Praray first emerges as the chief designer and construction engineer of the Makepeace firm, and was made a partner circa 1892.&lt;ref name="Praray"/&gt; As designer, in 1894, he patented what was known as "Praray's Improved Construction", a system of mill construction which separated the structure of the roof and floors of a mill from that of the walls, allowing much more daylight to enter the building. Visually, Praray's design may be most noted for its unusual window patterns, which emerge from the brick piers in a zig-zag pattern.&lt;ref&gt;Kidder, Frank E. ''The Architect's and Builder's Pocket-Book''. New York: John Wiley &amp; Sons, 1908.&lt;/ref&gt; Only five these mills have been documented as being built, but Chas. A. M. Praray &amp; Company touted it in advertisements for many years. Prior to its demolition around 2014, the Selma Cotton Mill of 1896 in [[Alabama]] was the best-preserved example of Praray's mill design.&lt;ref name="Selma"&gt;[https://www.loc.gov/pictures/collection/hh/item/al1286/ "Selma Cotton Mill, 218 Morgan Avenue, Selma, Dallas County, AL"]. ''https://www.loc.gov/''. n.d.&lt;/ref&gt; The only surviving example with walls intact is one of the Holt mills in [[Haw River, North Carolina]].

Praray has also been identified as the designer of Makepeace &amp; Co.'s Petersburg Silk Mills in [[Scranton, Pennsylvania]], designed in 1897. He prepared "several sets" of designs, one of which was likely to be a Praray's Improved Construction design. However, this was rejected in favor of a conventional design.&lt;ref name="Scranton"&gt;''Textile America: Silk and Silk Fabrics'' 27 Nov. 1897: 26. New York.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1898 Praray left to establish his own office, Chas. A. M. Praray &amp; Company, with William Whittam, Jr. The firm had two offices, one at Providence, and one at [[Charlotte, North Carolina]], managed by Whittam. The partnership existed until about 1909. Praray then took his son, Charles W. Praray, into partnership, as C. A. M. Praray &amp; Son. He died in 1910.&lt;ref name="Davidson"&gt;Davidson, Lisa Pfueller.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5944">{{See also|Neo-Aristotelianism (rhetorical criticism)}}
The '''Chicago School''' of [[literary criticism]] was a form of criticism of English literature begun at the [[University of Chicago]] in the 1930s, which lasted until the 1950s. It was also called [[Neo-Aristotelianism]], due to its strong emphasis on [[Aristotle]]’s concepts of plot, character and genre. It was partly a reaction to [[New Criticism]], a then highly popular form of literary criticism, which the Chicago critics accused of being too subjective and placing too much importance on irony and figurative language. They aimed instead for total objectivity and a strong classical basis of evidence for criticism. The New Critics regarded the language and poetic diction as most important, but the Chicago School considered such things merely the building material of poetry.  Like [[Aristotle]], they valued the structure or form of a literary work as a whole, rather than the complexities of the language. Despite this, the Chicago School is considered by some to be a part of the New Criticism movement.

==Beginnings==

[[Ronald Salmon Crane]] (1886–1967) is considered the founder of the Chicago Aristotelians. He began teaching at the [[University of Chicago]] in 1924, was made a professor in 1925, and chaired the English department there from 1935–1947. In 1935, he wrote “History versus Criticism in the Study of Literature” (published in ''English Journal'' 24 [1935]:645-67), in which he defined literary criticism as “simply the disciplined consideration, at once analytical and evaluative, of literary works as works of art.” Crane was greatly influenced by [[Richard McKeon]], a professor of philosophy at the University, who stressed [[Aristotle]]’s idea of "pluralism," which says that many systems of criticism are necessary to completely understand literature, specifically poetry, or in the case of philosophy, the world. Crane said that “the only rational ground for adhering to one [form of criticism] rather than to any of the others is its superior capacity to give us the special kind of understanding and evaluation of literature we want to get, at least for the time being.”

==Theory==

The question for the Chicago School (as it was for Aristotle) was always what the purpose of the theory of criticism was, what hypotheses were brought to bear by the theory about the nature of literature (for instance, whether it consisted of the words alone, or whether it was to be thought of as part of a larger context such as an era or an artist's life), and the definitions of words (such as the definition of tragedy or comedy).

The Chicago School claimed not to preclude other theories of criticism. It did, however, criticize those who were not clear or consistent about the initial hypotheses and definitions behind their theories. It thus appeared to many of the proponents of those theories that the Chicago School was claiming that theirs was the only good and effective approach to literature. For this reason, they were considered by some critics (including W.K. Wimsatt, whose essay "The Chicago Critics" is a critical assessment of their work) to be hypocritical, although they would vehemently deny this.

==Purpose==

Many of the ideas of the Chicago School are thought to have come out of the reorganization of undergraduate education at the [[University of Chicago]] by [[Robert Maynard Hutchins]], then President there. He placed great importance on primary sources and interdisciplinary studies for all students. Crane and his colleagues were forced to defend English as a valid topic of study, and the Chicago School might have developed partly from this pressure to put the study of English on a sound classical basis.

Other key figures in the Chicago School were W.R. Keast, [[Norman Maclean]], [[Elder Olson]], and Bernard Weinberg.  After this first generation, the most important critics to carry on the theory were [[Wayne C. Booth]] (who taught at the University of Chicago from 1947-1950 and again from 1962 until his death in 2005) and his contemporaries, Richard L. Levin, Sheldon Sacks, Robert Marsh, Arthur Heiserman, and Ralph W. Rader. Booth loosened the rigid categories of genre originally set forth by the Chicago School, and moved the concentration away from poetry towards rhetoric. The Chicago School has demonstrated continuing importance, and continuing flexibility, in the work of the third-generation Chicago critics, including Michael Boardman, Barbara Foley, [[Walter A. Davis]], Dorothy Hale, Elizabeth Langland, [[James Phelan (literary scholar)|James Phelan]], [[Peter J. Rabinowitz]], David H. Richter, and Harry Shaw, among others.

==Works==

Great works in the Chicago School include ''Critics and Criticism'' (Crane, ed. Chicago, 1952), ''The Languages of Criticism and the Structure of Poetry'' (Crane, Toronto, 1953), and ''The Rhetoric of Fiction'' (Booth. Chicago, 1983).&lt;br /&gt;

A '''cultural district''' is traditionally conceived as a well-recognized, labeled, [[mixed-use]] area of a [[Human settlement|settlement]] in which a high concentration of cultural facilities serves as the anchor of attraction.

A debate has emerged on the concept of the cultural district, promoting potentially ground-breaking initiatives, even if most of the literature has concentrated on urban clusters, cities of art and cities of culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Creative cities, cultural clusters and local economic development|author1=Cooke, P. |author2= Lazzeretti, L. |last-author-amp=yes |publisher = Edward Elgar|year = 2008|isbn = |location = Cheltenham|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Tourism, creativity and development|last = Richards, G., &amp; Wilson, J. (Eds.)|first = |publisher = Routledge|year = 2007|isbn = |location = London|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Facilities include: [[performance]] spaces, [[museums]], [[art museum|galleries]], artist studios, arts-related retail shops, music or media production studios, dance studios, high schools or colleges for the arts, libraries, [[arboretum]]s and gardens.{{fact|date=January 2017}}
Because they are [[mixed-use development]]s, cultural districts incorporate other facilities such as office complexes, [[retail]] spaces and, occasionally, [[residential area]]s.

The creation of a cultural district implies [[collaboration]] between the arts and the local community. Cultural districts may be seen by local authorities as a way to revitalize the “brownfields” of the urban core: areas of abandoned buildings that encourage businesses and residents to leave the [[citie]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.artsusa.org/information_services/research/impact_areas/arts_environments/001.asp |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-12-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081201051356/http://www.artsusa.org//information_services/research/impact_areas/arts_environments/001.asp |archivedate=2008-12-01 |df= }} Cultural Districts, Americans for the Arts&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cultural Districts, ‘The Arts as a Strategy for Revitalizing our Cities’, Americans for the Arts, 1998&lt;/ref&gt;

The developing theory of cultural districts increasingly conceives them as development models for local systems, where the term ‘district’ refers to supra-urban area.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Learning to design cultural districts and learning from designing them|url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09654313.2015.1133565|journal = European Planning Studies|date = 2016-01-19|issn = 0965-4313|pages = 1–19|volume = 0|issue = 0|doi = 10.1080/09654313.2015.1133565|first = Alberto|last = Francesconi|first2 = Claudia|last2 = Dossena}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sacco, P.

Such a linear top-down approach to analysis and design, however, exhibits many limitations when used for organizational settings characterized by a complex web of interdependencies.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The view of a cultural district as a complex adaptive system suggests new ideas and approaches for policy-makers, designers and managers. It also opens up debate on issues of organizational design and change.

==United States activities==
More than 90 cities in the [[United States]] have planned or implemented cultural districts, positioning the arts at the center of their urban revitalization efforts.{{fact|date=January 2017}}
All cultural districts are unique, reflecting their cities’ unique environment, including history of land use, urban growth and cultural development. There is no standard model.
Most cultural districts are built to take advantage of other city attractions such as historic features, [[Convention (meeting)|convention]] spaces and parks and other natural [[amenities]].

Structural considerations within or near the district, [[community]] leadership and social forces all influence the development of a cultural district and the type of [[district]] that results. Factors influencing the siting of cultural districts include: perceived need for urban revitalization, existing investment, property value and preexisting cultural facilities.

Unlike a cultural center or a [[shopping mall]], a cultural district comprises a large number of property owners, both public and private, who control the various properties involved, hence a structural [[complexity]]. The [[effectiveness]] of the coordinating agency in guiding the direction of the cultural district varies according to its size, budget, mandated functions and degree of authority, resulting in widespread variation in the coordinated cultural programming and administration services offered by cultural districts. The coordinated [[Government agency|agency]] appointed for the district must work carefully to ensure inclusiveness of concerns and to balance potentially conflicting interests.

Cultural districts offer two major types of [[tertiary sector of the economy|service]]s: one targets the arts community, providing [[marketing]] /promotion, [[box office]] services and property management; the other targets the district’s business and property owners, offering urban [[design]] and development services or administrative support.

The excitement and attraction of a cultural district is a high mixture of interesting things to do, places to see, and places to visit (both cultural and noncultural), across the day and evening.

Some artist-activists are promoting the concept of a "Naturally Occurring Cultural District," or NOCD, patterned after the demographic concept of a [[naturally occurring retirement community]]. A NOCD "supports existing neighborhood cultural assets rather than imposing arts institutions somewhere new," according to Tamara Greenfield, co-director of NOCD-New York. Co-director Caron Atlas explained: "If a cultural district has emerged 'naturally,' then it grows from, builds on and validates existing community assets rather than importing assets from outside a community."&lt;ref&gt;Urban Omnibus, [http://urbanomnibus.net/2010/11/naturally-occurring-cultural-districts/ Naturally Occurring Cultural Districts], Nov. 17, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, different conceptions of cultural districts include self-organization and emergence in different degrees (e.g. Lazzeretti, 2003; Le Blanc, 2010; Sacco et al., 2013; Stern &amp; Seifert, 2007). Many authors argue that districtualization is essentially spontaneous and that the conditions for formation can be recognized and sustained, not created from the top.&lt;ref name="Lazzeretti 635–648"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = City of art as a High Culture local system and cultural districtualization processes: the cluster of art restoration in Florence|url = http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1468-2427.00470/abstract|journal = International Journal of Urban and Regional Research|date = 2003-09-01|issn = 1468-2427|pages = 635–648|volume = 27|issue = 3|doi = 10.1111/1468-2427.00470|first = Luciana|last = Lazzeretti}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stern, M.

&lt;/ref&gt; If the conception of a cultual district as a complex adaptive system were accepted, the design process would be conceived as something more flexible, dynamic and in evolution. Complexity theory and complex adaptive systems should move understanding of supra-urban cultural districts towards a more holistic and bottom-up approach&lt;ref name="Lazzeretti 635–648"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Cultural Districts, A New Strategy for Regional Development?

This does not suggest inhibiting any attempt at prediction or planning. The use of qualitative analysis and rough estimations or agent-based modelling can represent a fertile ground for both future research, policy-making and managerial implications.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;

Between the late 1990s and early 2000s, Dentaa appeared on British TV dramas including EastEnders, Holby City, [[Judge John Deed]], Run Baby Run, and [[Prime Suspect]].&lt;ref name="Joy"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://entertainment.myjoyonline.com/pages/news/200705/5120.php |title=Dentaa retires from music |publisher=My Joy Online |date=29 August 2007 |accessdate=3 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ghana Celebrities"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ghanacelebrities.com/2010/03/19/congratulationsdentaa-gives-birth-to-another-cute-baby-boy |title=Congratulations:Dentaa Gives Birth to Another Cute Baby Boy |author=Chris-Vincent Agyapong Febiri |publisher=Ghana Celebrities.com |date=19 March 2010 |accessdate=3 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, she released a gospel album entitled "Wu Ye Nyame", through Alordia Promotions and Goodies Music Production. The album received airplay on radio stations in Ghana and Dentaa supported the release with a global tour.&lt;ref name="Album" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Jamati" /&gt;

=== The Dentaa Show ===

In 2006, Dentaa produced and fronted a new TV show for British ethnic minority channel [[OBE TV|OBE (Original Black Entertainment) TV]] called "The Dentaa Show". The 30-minute syndicated magazine programme, broadcast on [[Sky (UK and Ireland)|Sky]] Channel 155, was filmed in front of a live audience and split into three segments exploring the Ghanaian and African entertainment scene through interviews with celebrities, coverage of entertainment events and a focus on the latest music chart videos.&lt;ref name="Joy" /&gt; The show was Ghana's most-watched entertainment programme.&lt;ref name="Ambassador"&gt;{{cite journal |journal=The Ambassador |year=2010 |volume=1 |issue=1 |page=11 |title=GUBA to honour Ghanaian businesses in the UK |author=Davis, Rickie |url=http://issuu.com/magazineproduction/docs/ambassadormag_ezine |accessdate=3 December 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and in its first year, scored the highest ratings in first-run syndication in the 18 – 40 years [[demographic]], out-performing established [[talk shows]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.modernghana.com/music/16065/3/dentaa-show-to-hit-your-screens.html |title=Dentaa Show To Hit Your Screens |publisher=Modern Ghana |date=31 August 2011 |accessdate=3 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Dentaa Show ran for three seasons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.voiceofafricaradio.com/faces-of-the-week/432-faces-week-12-2010.html |title=Faces of the Week |publisher=Voice of Africa Radio |accessdate=3 December 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121130021300/http://voiceofafricaradio.com/faces-of-the-week/432-faces-week-12-2010.html |archivedate=30 November 2012 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Other TV shows and hosting appearances ===

Dentaa co-hosted Miss Ghana UK in 2007&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/NewsArchive/artikel.php?ID=129910 |title=Mzbel, Wutah, FBS storm U.K |publisher=GhanaWeb |date=31 August 2007 |accessdate=3 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the following year became a co-host on the fourth series of Mentor — Ghana's equivalent of [[The X Factor (TV series)|The X-Factor]]&lt;ref name="Ambassador"/&gt;  — on Ghanaian TV channel [[TV3 Ghana|TV3]], alongside Kofi Okyere Darko (aka "KOD").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.modernghana.com/music/8492/3/tv3-mentor-returns.html |title=TV3 Mentor Returns |author=Ameyaw Debrah |publisher=Modern Ghana|date=6 December 2008 |accessdate=3 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009 she co-hosted the Ghana Music Awards, performing a duet with [[Batman Samini]], and in 2010 presented Ghana's first make-over show, Darling Beauty Diaries. She did not, however, return for the fifth series of Mentor in 2010 as she was by then pregnant with her second child.&lt;ref name="Ghana Celebrities" /&gt;

In August 2012, it was announced that Dentaa would be making a return to TV with new weekly show '''Dinner with Dentaa''', which features celebrity guests cooking for her.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ameyawdebrah.com/dinner-with-dentaa-coming-soon/ |title= Dinner with Dentaa coming soon! |author=[[Ameyaw Debrah]] |publisher=Modern Ghana |date=30 August 2012 |accessdate=3 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== GUBA Awards ==

{{main article|Ghana UK-Based Achievement Awards}}

Outside of broadcasting, Dentaa is known as the founder and [[CEO]] of non-profit organisation the Ghana UK Based Achievement (GUBA) Awards which organises an annual [[awards ceremony]] in Britain recognising the ‘hugely significant’ contribution that British-Ghanaians make to society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.voice-online.co.uk/article/tony-and-cherie-blair-back-guba-awards |title=Tony and Cherie Blair back GUBA awards |publisher=The Voice |date=30 October 2012 |accessdate=3 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dentaa founded the awards in 2009 with the first awards ceremony taking place in London, England, in October 2010.&lt;ref name="Fab"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fabmagazineonline.com/fab-event-guba-2012-so-far/ |title=FAB Event: GUBA 2012 So Far |author=Claudia Andrews |publisher=Fab Magazine |date=4 November 2012 |accessdate=3 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dentaa, who describes herself as a "proud Ghanaian", had the idea to set up the awards as she felt that there was "nothing out there promoted and enriched my heritage".

GUBA was the first ceremony of its kind to specifically recognise Ghanaian achievement&lt;ref name="Africa News" /&gt; and has since been endorsed by dignitaries and organisations including The Ghana High Commission to the UK &amp; Ireland, The British High Commission in Ghana, The Ghana Ministry of Tourism, former British Prime Minister [[Tony Blair]] and wife [[Cherie Blair|Cherie]], [[Paul Boateng|Lord Paul Boateng]], [[Diane Abbott|Diane Abbott MP]] and [[FIFA]] President [[Sepp Blatter]].&lt;ref name="Fab" /&gt;

Dentaa's achievements with GUBA were acknowledged in 2011 when she was announced as one of the "Young Social Entrepreneurs of the Year" in the annual Future 100 Awards, and again in 2013 when she received the African Women in Europe (AWE) Award.&lt;ref name="AWE" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.modernghana.com/music/16632/3/dentaa-of-speak-to-dentaa-guba-awards-named-one-of.html |title=Dentaa of Speak To Dentaa &amp; GUBA Awards named one of the Future 100 Young Social Entrepreneurs for 2011 |publisher=Modern Ghana |date=15 November 2011 |accessdate=3 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dentaa has recently been nominated for two categories at the annual Women4Africa awards to be held in London in May 2014

== Connection with professional football ==

Dentaa has a strong connection to the world of football. She is the Manager of Ghana and former [[Sunderland FC|Sunderland]] [[Striker (football)|striker]] [[Asamoah Gyan]], and played an "influential role" in helping Ghana's national football team, popularly known as the [[The Black Stars|Black Stars]], secure the services of [[Arsenal FC|Arsenal]] [[midfielder]] [[Emmanuel Frimpong]].&lt;ref name="List"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.modernghana.com/music/16355/3/guba-ceo-dentaa-makes-the-list.html |title=GUBA CEO Dentaa makes the List |author=Kay Sarpong |publisher=Modern Ghana |date=6 October 2011 |accessdate=3 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2012, she organised the launch of the Benjani Mwaruwari Foundation, set up by [[Portsmouth FC|Portsmouth]] and [[Zimbabwe national football team]] striker [[Benjani Mwaruwari]] to build a [[football academy]] for [[Underprivileged children|underprivileged youths]] in [[Zimbabwe]].&lt;ref name="Filla"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ghanafilla.net/dentaa-to-host-benjani-mwaruwari-foundation-in-zimbabwe-with-guest-appearances-by-emmanuel-adebayor-yaya-and-kolo-toure-kanu-and-jay-jay-okocha/ |title=Dentaa to host Benjani Mwaruwari Foundation in Zimbabwe |publisher=GhanaFilla.net |date=26 May 2012 |accessdate=3 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following month, in June 2012, Dentaa helped the Arthur Wharton Foundation present a statuette of [[Arthur Wharton]] — the first professional black football player — to [[FIFA]] President Sepp Blatter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.caribdirect.com/2012/06/11/first-black-professional-footballer-arthur-wharton-honoured-by-guba-and-fifa/ |title=First black professional footballer, Arthur Wharton honoured by GUBA and FIFA |publisher=GhanaFilla.net |date=7 June 2012 |accessdate=3 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Arthur Wharton Marquette Statue is now displayed in the presidents' lounge at FIFA headquarters in [[Zurich]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-tees-18340408 |title=World's first black professional footballer Arthur Wharton honoured |publisher=BBC.co.uk |date=7 June 2012 |accessdate=3 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dentaa's work in the sporting arena was recognised in 2011, when she was nominated for the 2011 Black List Awards — a UK-based awards scheme that acknowledges the contribution of the black community for achievements across all levels of football, and which is supported by [[the Football Association]], [[Professional Footballers' Association]] and Black Collective of Media in Sport (BCOMS), among others. Her management of Gyan and influence in the signing of Frimpong to the Ghana national team were "key factors" in her nomination.&lt;ref name="List" /&gt;

First used by the [[Paracas culture]], it was later adopted by the [[Nazca culture|Nazca]]. While at first the Paracas tended to incise designs derived from the art of the [[Chavin culture]] on the surface of the vessels,&lt;ref&gt;[http://collections.lacma.org/node/197367 ''Covered Double Spout and Bridge Vessel, 800-100 B.C.'' Entry on the website of the LACMA] retrieved 11 May 2009&lt;/ref&gt; later on they began to treat the vessel as a sculptural form, an advance facilitated by developments in ceramic technology that allowed them construct vessels with thinner walls.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/ho/04/sac/ho_63.232.55.htm "Gourd bottle &amp;#91;Peru; Topará&amp;#93; (63.232.55)".] In Heilbrunn Timeline of Art History. New York: The Metropolitan Museum of Art, 2000–. (October 2006) Retrieved 11 May 2009&lt;/ref&gt; This tradition was continued by the Nazca, whose vessels were elaborately figurative (see illustration below right), decorated with polychrome glazes, or both. 
 
The vessels were constructed by the [[coiling (pottery)|coil method]]. The Nazca would then apply multicolored [[slip (ceramics)|slip]] to achieve polychrome effects before the vessels were fired, an advance over the Paracas, who had painted the vessels with resins after firing. The Nazca technique allowed for much brighter and more permanent colors, whose sheen was enhanced by burnishing after the vessel was fired.&lt;ref name = "Brit"&gt;[https://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/highlights/highlight_objects/aoa/d/double_spout_and_bridge_vessel.aspx ''Double spout and bridge vessel with hummingbirds''], on the Website of the British Museum. Retrieved 11 May 2009. Slip firing fuses the pigmented minerals with the clay itself, while resin simply sat on the surface, and as an organic material was subject to decay&lt;/ref&gt;

Both the Paracas and the Nazca appear to have used this type of vessel for ritual purposes, as they are most often found in graves.&lt;ref name = "Brit" /&gt;

'''Eric Newton''' (1893–1965) was an English artist, writer, broadcaster and art critic. He produced several books in addition to his newspaper and radio work and created mosaics for Ludwig Oppenheimer Ltd, mostly on a religious theme. His radio broadcasts made him well known to the British public in the 1930s.

==Career==
After gaining a BA from [[Manchester University]] in 1913, he worked as a designer at Ludwig Oppenheimer Ltd, the [[mosaic]] firm founded by his grandfather and based in Old Trafford, Manchester. His work, and that of the Oppenheimer firm is still to be seen in several churches in Britain and Ireland. He took part in the [[International Exposition of Modern Industrial and Decorative Arts|Paris exhibition]] in 1925.&lt;ref name=obittimes&gt;{{Cite news |title=Obituary. Mr. Eric Newton |newspaper=The Times |date=11 March 1965}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He is best known as an art critic and writer. He was appointed art critic of the [[Manchester Guardian]] in 1930, although he had provided copy for that paper for some years prior to this. He was art critic for [[The Times]] for three years from 1947,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dictionaryofarthistorians.org/newtone.htm | title=Dictionary of Art Historians. E. Newton}}&lt;/ref&gt; and wrote frequently for the [[New York Times]], [[Time and Tide (magazine)|''Time and Tide'']] magazine&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=Eric Newton, 71, London Art Critic. Newsman, author, Teacher and Lecturer Is Dead |newspaper=The New York Times |date=11 March 1965}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[ArtReview]]&lt;ref name="art review twitter"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://twitter.com/ArtReview_/status/895275374342537217 |title=''ArtReview 'Thoughts about promise'' Eric Newton}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Newton delivered radio lectures on art, notably the 1935 [[British Broadcasting Corporation|BBC]] 12 part series "The Artist and his Public" subsequently turned into the first of several books.&lt;ref name=Rfield&gt;{{cite web |title=''L. Oppenheimer Ltd and the Mosaics of Eric Newton.''|url=http://www.tilesoc.org.uk/events/conference2006/papers/pdf/field.pdf  Robert Field}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= |first= |year= 1935 |title= The artist and His Public |url= |location= |publisher=Allen &amp; Unwin |isbn= |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and took part in the radio arts series ''The Critics''. In this programme, his Times Obituary states "his lucidity and critical sense were trenchantly displayed".&lt;ref name=obittimes /&gt; The Oxford Dictionary of Art describes him as "a clear and polished writer and also an articulate lecturer and radio broadcaster".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= |first= |year= 1952 |title= Oxford Dictionary of Art |url= |location= |publisher=OUP |isbn=978-0-19-172762-7 |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

These broadcasts made his name well known and local newspaper archives reveal that Newton was clearly in demand, delivering public lectures across the country in the late 1930s and 1940s.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=26 March 1942 |title= Modern Painting Exhibition at Plymouth.

Newton undertook lecture tours to North America in 1937, 1953 and 1956, the 1937 tour of Canada was sponsored by the [[National Gallery of Canada]]. His diary of this tour was subsequently published (see below). The 1956 tour included the [[Memorial University of Newfoundland]] where he lectured on modern art.

==Personal life==
Newton was born in 1893 to Lehmann James Oppenheimer and Edith née Newton. His mother was from [[Heaton Mersey]].&lt;ref&gt;1911 census&lt;/ref&gt; In 1908 he was awarded a Foundation Scholarship to [[Hulme Grammar School]] from [[William Hulme#Hulme.27s Charity|Hulme's Charity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=Hulme's Charity |newspaper=Manchester Courier |date=1 October 1908}}&lt;/ref&gt; After graduation from Manchester University, he served in the army during the [[First World War]], joining the [[Manchester Regiment]] as a 2nd Lieutenant from the Manchester University Contingent of the [[Officer Training Corps]] on 14 November 1914.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=28973 |date=13 November 1914 |page=9276 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was promoted to temporary captain in September 1915.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=29312 |date=1 October 1915 |page=9664 }}&lt;/ref&gt; His medal card suggests he served in France and was awarded the [[Victory Medal (United Kingdom)|Victory Medal]] and [[British War Medal]].&lt;ref&gt;[[National Archives (UK)|National Archives]] Catalogue Reference:WO/372/14&lt;/ref&gt;

His father (also a mosaic manufacturer in the family firm) served as a lieutenant in the London Regiment ([[Artists Rifles|Artists' Rifles]]) and died in 1916&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/regimentalrollof00highiala#page/10/mode/2up|title=The regimental roll of honour and war record of the Artists' Rifles (1/28th, 2/28th and 3/28th battalions, the London Regiment T.

Lehmann is buried in the [[Boulogne]] Eastern Cemetery (Grave ref VII.

Though the [[London Gazette]] records the recruitment of "Eric Newton Oppenheimer", and promotion of "Eric N. Oppenheimer", it was after the war that he formally changed his name from Oppenheimer to his mother's maiden name of Newton, the latter sounding less German. He married his first wife, Isabel Aileen Vinicombe on 29 November 1915 at the Church of St James, Birch in [[Rusholme]],.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lan-opc.org.uk/Manchester/Rusholme/stjames/marriages_1896-1921.html|title=Lancashire OnLine Parish Clerk Project |accessdate=9 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; the couple divorced in 1934 after which Newton married the fashion designer [[Stella Mary Newton|Stella Mary Pearce]]. The couple moved to London, living at 3 Cumberland Gardens. Newton died in his London office in 1965.

Filmed in [[Bathurst, New Brunswick|Bathurst]], [[New Brunswick]], Canada, it was tipped as the first-ever New Brunswick Acadian movie, but was actually the second New Brunswick Acadian movie after ''Jerome's Secret'' (1994) ''Le secret de Jérôme'' by Phil Comeau.&lt;ref&gt;[http://jam.canoe.ca/Movies/Reviews/F/Full_Blast/2000/04/07/752965.html Jam!

}}'''Guerrilla Girls''' is an anonymous group of feminist, female artists devoted to fighting sexism and racism within the [[art world]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artists/guerrilla-girls-6858 Guerrilla Girls in Tate Modern Collection]&lt;/ref&gt; The group formed in New York City in 1985 with the mission of bringing [[gender inequality|gender]] and [[racial inequality]] into focus within the greater arts community. The group employs [[culture jamming]] in the form of posters, books, billboards, and public appearances to expose discrimination and corruption. To remain anonymous, members don [[gorilla suit|gorilla masks]] and use pseudonyms that refer to deceased female artists. According to GG1, identities are concealed because issues matter more than individual identities,  "[M]ainly, we wanted the focus to be on the issues, not on our personalities or our own work."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title=Guerilla Girls Bare All| url=http://www.guerrillagirls.com/interview/index.shtml| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140113012650/http://www.guerrillagirls.com/interview/index.shtml| archivedate=2014-01-13| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In the spring of 1985, seven women launched the Guerrilla Girls in response to the [[Museum of Modern Art]]'s exhibition "An International Survey of Recent Painting and Sculpture" [1984), whose roster of 165 artists included only 13 women.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.moma.org/d/c/press_releases/W1siZiIsIjMyNzM2OSJdXQ.pdf?sha=6bd28a21a15dd204 MoMA Fact Sheet]&lt;/ref&gt; Inaugurating MoMA's newly renovated and expanded building, this exhibition claimed to survey that era's most important painters and sculptors from 17 countries.&lt;ref name=Brenson&gt;{{cite news|last=Brenson|first=Michael|title=A Living Artists Show at the Modern Museum|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1984/04/21/arts/a-living-artists-show-at-the-modern-museum.html?pagewanted=all|accessdate=27 February 2013|newspaper=The New York Times|date=April 21, 1984}}&lt;/ref&gt; The proportion of artists of color was even smaller, and none of them were women. [[File:Guerrilla Girls - V&amp;A Museum, London.jpg|thumb|400x400px|Guerrilla Girls at the V&amp;A Museum, London|left]]
 
A comment by the show's curator, [[Kynaston McShine]], further highlights that era's explicit art world gender bias: "Kynaston McShine gave interviews saying that any artist who wasn't in the show should rethink '''his''' career."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Guerrilla Girls|title=Confessions of the Guerrilla Girls, with an essay by Whitney Chadwick|date=1995|publisher=Harper Perennial|location=New York|isbn=9780060950880|page=13}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In reaction to the exhibition and McShine's overt bias, they protested in front of MoMA. Thus, the Guerrilla Girls were born.

When the protests yielded little success, the Guerrilla Girls wheat-pasted posters throughout downtown Manhattan, particularly in the [[SoHo]] and [[East Village, Manhattan|East Village]] neighborhoods.&lt;ref name="Cooper1"&gt;{{cite web | author=Ashton Cooper | year=2010 | title=Guerrilla Girls speak on social injustice, radical art | work=A&amp;E | publisher=Columbia Spectator | url=http://www.columbiaspectator.com/2010/09/22/guerrilla-girls-speak-social-injustice-radical-art | accessdate=20 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Soon after, the group expanded their focus to include racism in the art world, attracting artists of color. They also took on projects outside of New York, enabling them to address sexism and racism nationally and internationally. Though the art world has remained the group's main focus, the Guerrilla Girls' agenda has included sexism and racism in films, mass and popular culture, and politics. [[Tokenism]] also represents a major group concern.&lt;ref name="Cooper1"/&gt;

During its first years, the Guerrilla Girls conducted "weenie counts," such that members visited institutions like the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] and counted artworks' male-to-female subject ratios. Data gathered from the Met's public collections in 1989 showed that women artists had produced less than 5% of the works in the Modern Art Department, while 85% of the nudes were female.
[[File:Guerrilla Girls!.jpg|thumb|Guerrilla Girls wear gorilla masks whenever making public appearances.|left]]

Early organizing was based around meetings, during which members evaluated statistical data gathered regarding gender inequality within the New York City's art scene. The Guerrilla Girls also worked closely with artists, encouraging them to speak to those within the community to bridge the [[sex ratio|gender gap]] where they perceived it.&lt;ref name="Oral1" /&gt;

When asked about the masks, the girls answer "We were Guerrillas before we were Gorillas. From the beginning the press wanted publicity photos. We needed a disguise. No one remembers, for sure, how we got our fur, but one story is that at an early meeting, an original girl, a bad speller, wrote 'Gorilla' instead of 'Guerrilla.' It was an enlightened mistake. It gave us our 'mask-ulinity.'"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.guerrillagirls.com/interview/index.shtml |title=Interview |publisher=Guerrilla Girls |date= |accessdate=2014-07-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140113012650/http://www.guerrillagirls.com/interview/index.shtml |archivedate=2014-01-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In an interview with [[Interview Magazine|New York Times]] the Guerrilla Girls were quoted, "Anonymous free speech is protected by the Constitution. You'd be surprised what comes out of your mouth when you wear a mask."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.guerrillagirls.com/info/interview%20mag.shtml |title=Interview Magazine |publisher=Guerrilla Girls |date= |accessdate=2014-07-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140805212205/http://www.guerrillagirls.com/info/interview%20mag.shtml |archivedate=2014-08-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 1985, the Guerrilla Girls have worked for an increased awareness of sexism and greater accountability on the part of curators, art dealers, collectors and critics.&lt;ref name="guerrillagirls.com"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.guerrillagirls.com/interview/index.shtml |title=Guerrilla Girls Bare All: An Interview |publisher=Guerrilla Girls |date= |accessdate=2014-01-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140113012650/http://www.guerrillagirls.com/interview/index.shtml |archivedate=2014-01-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The group is credited, above all, with sparking dialogue, and bringing national and international attention to issues of sexism and racism within the arts.

== Influences ==
Many feminist artists in the 1970s dared to imagine that female artists could produce authentically and radically different art, undoing the prevailing visual paradigm. The pioneering feminist critic, [[Lucy Lippard]] curated an all-women exhibition in 1974, effectively protesting what most deemed a deeply flawed approach, that of merely assimilating women into the prevailing art system.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Chave, Anna C. "The Guerrilla Girls' Reckoning." ''Art Journal'' 70.2 (2011): 102-11. Web.&lt;/ref&gt; Shaped by the 1970s women's movement, the Guerrilla Girls resolved to devise new strategies. Most noticeably, they realized that 1970s-era tools such as pickets and marches proved ineffective, as evidenced by how easily MoMA could ignore 200 protestors from the [[Women's Caucus for Art]]. "We had to have a new image and a new kind of language to appeal to a younger generation of women," recalls one of the founding Guerrilla Girls, who goes by "Liubov Popova."&lt;ref&gt;"Oral history interview with Guerrilla Girls Elizabeth Vigée LeBrun and Liubov Popova." January 19, 2008. ''Archives of American Art''. Smithsonian Institution.&lt;/ref&gt; The Guerrilla Girls sought an alternative approach, one that would defeat views of the 1970s Feminist movements as man-hating, anti-maternal, strident, and humorless:&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt; Versed in poststructuralist theories, they adopted 1970s initiatives, but with a different language and style. Earlier feminists tackled grim and unfunny issues such as sexual violence, inspiring the Guerrilla Girls to keep their spirits intact by approaching their work with wit and laughter, thus preventing a backlash.&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt;

==Work: actions, posters and billboards==
===Art world===
[[File:La Barbe et les Guerrilla Girls sous l'oeil d'Alice Coffin.jpg|thumb|French feminist group [[La Barbe]] (Beard) meets the Guerrilla Girls at the Palais de Tokyo (Paris, 2013).]]
Throughout their existence, the Guerrilla Girls have gained the most attention for their bold [[protest art]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.brooklynmuseum.org/eascfa/feminist_art_base/guerrilla-girls|title=Brooklyn Museum: Guerrilla Girls|website=www.brooklynmuseum.org|access-date=2017-02-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The Guerrilla Girls' projects (mostly posters at first) express observations, concerns, and ideals regarding numerous social topics. Their art has always been fact-driven, and informed by the group's unique approach to data collection, such as "weenie counts." To be more inclusive and to make their posters more eye-catching, the Guerrilla Girls tend to pair facts with humorous images.&lt;ref&gt;"We use facts, humor and outrageous visuals to expose sexism, racism and corruption in politics, art, film and pop culture."&lt;/ref&gt; Although the Guerrilla Girls gained fame for wheat-pasting provocative campaign posters around New York City, the group has also enjoyed public commissions and indoor exhibitions.

In addition to posting posters around downtown Manhattan, they passed out thousands of small [[handbills]] based on their designs at various events.&lt;ref name="Oral1" /&gt; The first posters were mainly black and white fact-sheets, highlighting inequalities between male and female artists with regard to number of exhibitions, gallery representation and pay. Their posters revealed how sexist the art world was in comparison to other industries and to national averages. For example, in 1985 they printed a poster showing that the salary gap in the art world between men and women was starker than the United States average, proclaiming "Women in America earn only 2/3 of what men do. Women artists earn only 1/3 of what men do." These early posters often targeted specific galleries and artists. Another 1985 poster listed the names of some of the most famous working artists, such as [[Bruce Nauman]] and [[Richard Serra]]. The poster asked "What do these artists have in common?" with the answer "They allow their work to be shown in galleries that show no more than 10% of women or none at all."
 
The group were also activists for equal representation of women in institutional art, and highlighted artist [[Louise Bourgeois]] in their "Advantages to Being a Women artist," poster in 1988 as one line read, "Knowing your career might not pick up till after you're 80."&lt;ref&gt;Louise Bourgeois; The Spider, The Mistress &amp; The Tangerine. Directed by Marian Cajori and Amei Wallach. 2008. New York, NY: Zeitgeist Films, 2009. DVD&lt;/ref&gt; Their pieces are also notable for their use of combative statements such as "When racism and sexism are no longer fashionable, what will your art collection be worth?"&lt;ref name="Cooper1" /&gt;''

Dearest Art Collector (1986)
Dearest Art Collector is a 560x430 mm screen-print on paper. This is one of thirty posters published in a portfolio entitled Guerrilla Girls Talk Back. This print is unusual in the portfolio in that it takes the form of an enlarged handwritten letter on baby pink paper. The extremely rounded cursive script crowned with a frowning flower exudes femininity, symbolizing the biting sarcasm for which the Guerrilla Girls were known for. The Guerrilla Girls sent this poster to well- known art collectors across the United States, pointing out how few works they owned by women artists. This send up of femininity is aimed at the expectation that, even when presenting a serious complaint, women should do so in a socially acceptable 'nice' way. "We know that you feel terrible about this" appeals to the feelings of the recipient. This piece was a commentary on how hard it is for female artists, and what lengths they must go through in order to be recognized and taken seriously. Women are constantly expected to perform a certain way and this print is the embodiment of how tumultuous it is for women all around the world to be recognized in the eyes of men with power.  The group later transcribed it into other languages and sent it to collectors outside the U.S. A practical joke with serious implications, this poster is now (somewhat ironically) a collector's item.

&lt;blockquote&gt;The posters were rude; they named names and they printed statistics (and almost always cited the source of those statistics at the bottom, making them difficult to dismiss). They embarrassed people. In other words, they worked.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Tallman|first=Susan|title=Guerrilla Girls|journal=Arts Magazine|year=1991|volume=65|issue=8|pages=21–2|url=http://www.susan-tallman.com/guerilla-girls.pdf|accessdate=27 February 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130702074700/http://www.susan-tallman.com/guerilla-girls.pdf|archivedate=2 July 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Guerrilla Girls' first color poster, which remains the group's most iconic image, is the 1989 Metropolitan Museum poster, which used data from the group's first "weenie count." In response to the overwhelming amount of female nudes counted in the Modern Art sections, the poster asks, sarcastically, ''"Do women have to be naked to get into the Met. Museum?"''. Next to the text is an image of the [[Jean Auguste Dominique Ingres]] painting [[La Grande Odalisque]], one of the most famous female nudes in Western art history, with a gorilla head placed over the original face.

In 1990, the group designed a [[billboard]] featuring the [[Mona Lisa]] that was placed along the [[West Side Highway]] supported by the New York City public art fund. For one day, New York's [[MTA Bus Company]] also displayed bus advertisements with Met. Museum poster. [[Stickers]] also became popular [[Business card|calling cards]] representative of the group.

The Guerrilla Girls infiltrated the bathrooms of the newly opened [[Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum|Guggenheim Soho]], placing stickers regarding [[Gender inequality|female inequality]] on the walls.&lt;ref name="Oral1" /&gt; 
In 1998, Guerrilla Girls West protested at the [[San Jose Museum of Art]], over low representation of women artists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.metroactive.com/papers/metro/04.23.98/guerrillagirls-9816.html| title=Masking for Art | work=Metro| date=April 29, 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to researching and exposing sexism in the art world, the Guerrilla Girls have received commissions from numerous organizations and institutions, such as [[The Nation]] (2001),&lt;ref name="thenation.com"&gt;https://www.thenation.com/issue/april-2-2001/&lt;/ref&gt; Fundación Bilbao Arte (2002), [[Istanbul Modern]] (2006) and [[Witte de With Center for Contemporary Art]] (2007). They have also partnered with [[Amnesty International]], contributing pieces to a show under the organization's "Protect the Human" initiative.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.amnesty.org.uk/news_details.asp?NewsID=16632 |title=Press releases in 2014 |publisher=Amnesty International UK |accessdate=2014-01-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120213002545/http://www.amnesty.org.uk/news_details.asp?NewsID=16632 |archivedate=2012-02-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Public commissions===
In 2005, the group exhibited large-format posters ''Welcome to the Feminist Biennale'' at the [[Venice Biennale]] (the first in 110 years to be overseen by women), scrutinizing 101 years of Biennale history in terms of diversity. ''Where Are the Women Artists of Venice?'' explored the fact that most works owned by Venice's historical museums are kept in storage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Robinson|first=Walter|title=Festive Venice|url=http://www.artnet.com/Magazine/reviews/walrobinson/robinson6-10-05.asp|work=Artnet|accessdate=27 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.economist.com/node/4032689 "Girl Power." ''The Economist''. June 2, 2005]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Carol Vogel. "Subdued Biennale forgoes shock factor." ''The New York Times''. June 13, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2005, the Guerrilla Girls have been invited to produce special projects for international institutions, sometimes for the very institutions they have criticized. Offers that pose a dilemma are carefully considered, so as to avoid censure, since one way to improve institutions is to criticize them from inside.&lt;ref&gt;"Guerrilla Girl Gig," SUNY Stony Brook, NY, October, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

Their 2006 poster ''The Future For Turkish Women Artists as Revealed by the Guerrilla Girls'', commissioned by [[Istanbul Modern]], demonstrated that the status of women artists in Turkey was better than in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;
http://vis129f.wikifoundry.com/page/Guerrilla+Girls%3A+"The+Future+for+Turkish+Women+Artists"-+Nicole+Young&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2007, the [[Washington Post]] published their ''Horror on the National Mall!'', a one-page newspaper spread attacking the absence of diversity among tax-payer supported museums on the Mall in Washington, DC.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/artsandliving/museums/features/2007/feminism-and-art/guerrilla_girls.html&lt;/ref&gt; During the 2007 ART-ATHINA, the Guerrilla Girls projected "Dear Art Collector" in Greek onto the entrance's façade. In 2015, they projected their "Dear Art Collector" animation onto a museum façade, taking on collectors who fail to pay employees a living wage.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.artinamericamagazine.com/news-features/news/your-art-fair-antidote-the-guerrilla-girls-turn-30/&lt;/ref&gt;
To commemorate the 20th Anniversary of the [[École Polytechnique massacre]], the University of Quebec commissioned their ''Troubler Le Repos'' (Disturbing The Peace) poster, whose texts addressed anti-women [[hate-speech]] since [[Ancient Greece]] to [[Rush Limbaugh]].

In 2009, they launched ''I'm not a feminist, but If I were this is what I'd complain about ... '', an interactive graffiti wall that enables women who don't see themselves as feminists the means to target gender issues with the hope that active participation will broaden their perspectives.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nwci.ie/?/news/article/guerrilla_girls_take_on_irish_arts_exclusion_of_women&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, this traveled to Krakòw's Art Boom Festival.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/julian-vigo/guerrilla-girls-plant-a-b_b_3462596.html&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, an advertising truck towed ''Do women Have To Be Naked To Get Into Boston Museums?'' around Boston.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.bostonglobe.com/arts/theater-art/2012/09/22/guerrilla-girls-launch-art-protest-targeting-museum-fine-arts/953Q0IyP3H9WxrWIcUhXUJ/story.html&lt;/ref&gt; Invited by Yoko Ono to participate in the 2013 [[Meltdown Festival]], the Guerrilla Girls updated their 2003 ''Estrogen Bomb'' poster, which had premiered in [[The Village Voice]] in 2003.

During Winter 2016, they participated in "Twin City Takeover," art exhibitions and art projects organized by a consortium of local art organizations sited around Minneapolis and St. Paul.&lt;ref&gt;https://wedompls.org/urban-projects/guerrilla-girls/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.walkerart.org/magazine/2015/guerrilla-girls-30th-anniversary&lt;/ref&gt;

===Film world===
[[File:Guerrilla Girls Billboard.jpg|thumb|right|Guerrilla Girls billboard in Los Angeles protesting white male dominance at the [[Academy Awards|Oscars]] in 2002.]]

To protest the dearth of female directors, the Guerrilla Girls distributed stickers during the 2001 [[Sundance Film Festival]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.thenation.com/article/west-indies/&lt;/ref&gt; [[The Nation]] invited them to 
present ''Birth of Feminism'',&lt;ref name="thenation.com"/&gt; which they updated and presented in 2007 as a banner outside Witte de With Center for Contemporary Arts. Since 2002, Guerrilla Girls Inc. have designed and installed billboards during the Oscars that address white male dominance in the [[film industry]], such as: "Anatomically Correct Oscars," "Even the Senate is More Progressive than Hollywood," "The Birth of Feminism,"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.juliethebolt.net/page/page/319287.htm]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120325230231/http://www.juliethebolt.net/page/page/319287.htm |date=March 25, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; "Unchain the Women Directors."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://art-for-a-change.com/blog/2006/02/guerrilla-girls-vs-king-kong.html |title=» Guerrilla Girls vs. King Kong |publisher=Art-for-a-change.com |date=2006-02-05 |accessdate=2014-01-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 2015 Reykjavik Arts Festival, the Guerrilla Girls displayed ''National Film Quiz'', a billboard criticizing the fact that 87% of national funding for films goes to men, despite women playing an important part of Iceland's public and private sectors.&lt;ref&gt;http://grapevine.is/culture/movies-theatre/2015/06/24/the-boys-club-men-are-strong-and-carry-around-big-cameras/&lt;/ref&gt; 
In light of 2016's #Oscarssowhite campaign, the Guerrilla Girls updated the above billboards, presenting them on downtown Minneapolis streets for "Twin City Takeover."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.guerrillagirls.com/exhibitions/&lt;/ref&gt;

===Politics and social issues===
Although the Guerrilla Girls' protest art directed at the art world remains their most well-known work, throughout their existence the group has periodically targeted politicians, specifically conservative [[Republican Party (United States)|Republicans]]. Those criticized have included [[George H.W. Bush|George Bush]], [[Newt Gingrich]], and most recently [[Michele Bachmann]]. In 1991, the Artist and Homeless Collaborative invited them to work with homeless women to create posters in response to homelessness and the first Gulf War. 
Between 1992 and 1994, Guerrilla Girl posters addressed the 1992 Presidential election, reproductive rights (done for march on Washington in 1992), gay and lesbian rights, and the LA riots.  During the 2012 election, they displayed their ''Even Michele Bachman believes. ...   '' on a billboard adjacent a football stadium to advertise her plan to: ban same-sex marriages, require Voter Id Checks, and spend money implementing statewide voter IDs.&lt;ref&gt;http://articles.latimes.com/2012/oct/19/entertainment/la-et-cm-guerrilla-girls-use-twist-to-make-bachmann-a-gay-marriage-booster-20121019&lt;/ref&gt; Their 2013 posters discussed the Homeland Terror Alert system and Arnold Schwarzenegger's gubernatorial campaign.

In 2016, the Guerrilla Girls launched the "President Trump Announces New Commemorative Months" campaign in the form of stickers and posters, which they distributed during the "Women's March on Washington" in LA and NYC, as well as the J20 event at the Whitney Museum of Art&lt;ref&gt;http://www.artnews.com/2017/01/20/speak-out-on-inauguration-day-words-at-the-whitney-museum-take-aim-at-trump/&lt;/ref&gt; and the Fire Fink protest at MoMA.&lt;ref&gt;https://hyperallergic.com/360236/protesters-demand-moma-drop-trump-advisor-from-its-board/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Work: publications and merchandise==

To shed light on inequality in the art world, the Guerrilla Girls have published numerous books. In 1995, they published their first book, ''Confessions of the Guerrilla Girls,'' a compilation of 50 works plus a self-interview.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.amazon.com/Confessions-Guerrilla-Girls-Guerilla/dp/0060950889&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mark Dery. "Art Attack." ''The New York Times Book Review''. July 30, 1995&lt;/ref&gt; In 1998, they published ''The Guerrilla Girls Bedside Companion to the History of Western Art'', a consciousness-raising comic book that sold 82,000 copies, as it explores how art history's male domination constrained several female artists' careers.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.amazon.com/Guerrilla-Bedside-Companion-History-Western/dp/014025997X&lt;/ref&gt; In 2003, they published ''Bitches, Bimbos and Ballbreakers'', a down and dirty catalogue of "The Top Stereotypes from Cradle to Grave." Offering thumbnail histories for cultural clichés ranging from "Daddy's Girl," "the Girl Next Door," "the Bimbo/Dumb Blonde" to "the Bitch /Ballbreaker", each is given "trademark Guerrilla Girl treatment: pointed factoids and cool graphics."&lt;ref&gt;Hoban, Phoebe (January 4, 2004). [https://www.nytimes.com/2004/01/04/theater/art-masks-still-in-place-but-firmly-in-the-mainstream.html "Masks Still in Place but Firmly in the Mainstream"], ''The New York Times''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.motherjones.com/media/2004/01/bitches-bimbos-and-ballbreakers&lt;/ref&gt;

Their 2004 book ''The Guerrilla Girl's Museum Activity Book'' (reissued in 2012) parodies children's museum activity books. Meant to teach children how to both appreciate and critique museums, this book provides activities that reveal the problematic aspects of museum culture and major museum collections. In 2009, they published a history of hysteria, ''The Hysterical Herstory Of Hysteria And How It Was Cured From Ancient Times Until Now''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.guerrillagirls.com/books |title=Books by the Guerrilla Girls |publisher=Guerrilla Girls |accessdate=2016-12-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; MFC-Michèle Didier reprinted it in 2011 and 2016.

==Presentations==
An important part of Guerrilla Girls' outreach since 1985 has been presentations and workshops at colleges, universities, art organizations and sometimes at museums. The presentations, known as "gigs", attract hundreds and sometimes thousands of attendees. In the gig, they play music, videos, show slides and talk about the history of their work, how it has evolved. At the end the GGs interact with audience members. New work is always included and gig material changes all the time. They have done hundreds of these events and have travelled to nearly every state as well as Europe, South America and Australia.

In recognition of their work, the Guerrilla Girls have been invited to give talks at world-renowned museums, including a presentation at the MoMA's 2007 "Feminist Futures" Symposium. They have also been invited to speak at art schools and universities across the globe, and gave a 2010 commencement speech at the [[School of the Art Institute of Chicago]].
To mark the 30th anniversary of the Guerrilla Girls, [[Matadero Madrid]] hosted "Guerrilla Girls: 1985-2015," an exhibition featuring most of the collective's production accompanied by a series of events including a talk/performance by Guerrilla Girl members Frida Kahlo and Käthe Kollwitz.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mataderomadrid.org/ficha/4093/guerrilla-girls.html|title=Guerrilla Girls 1985-2015|website=MataderoMadrid|access-date=2016-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://vimeo.com/119127188|title=GUERRILLA GIRLS CONFERENCIA / PERFORMANCE|website=Vimeo|access-date=2016-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; The exhibition also showed the 1992 documentary "Guerrilla in Our Midst" by Amy Harrison.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://guerrillasinourmidst.com/|title=Guerrillas In Our Midst|website=guerrillasinourmidst.com|access-date=2016-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversies==

===Diversity===
Despite having routinely challenged art institutions to display more artists of color, both members and critics want the Guerrilla Girls to be more diverse. Zora Neale Hurston recalls Guerrilla Girl membership as "mostly white" and largely mirroring the art world demographics that they critiqued.&lt;ref name=":45"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.aaa.si.edu/collections/interviews/oral-history-interview-guerrilla-girls-zora-neale-hurston-and-agnes-martin-15840|title=Oral history interview with Guerrilla Girls Zora Neale Hurston and Agnes Martin, 2008 May 17 - Oral Histories {{!}} Archives of American Art, Smithsonian Institution|last=Richards|first=Judith Olch|last2=Hurston|first2=Zora Neale|date=2008-05-17|website=www.aaa.si.edu|access-date=2016-06-07|last3=Martin|first3=Agnes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite sporting gorilla masks to downplay personal identity, some members attribute Guerilla Girl interests to the fact that de facto leaders "Frida Kahlo" and "Kathe Kollwitz" are both white.&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt; ("Frida Kahlo" has also been criticized for her appropriation of a Latina artist's name.)&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=No No's: Guerrilla Girls at the State Theatre|last=Lodu|first=Mary|date=March 2016|work=INREVIEW|access-date=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, any precise information on the demographics of the Guerrilla Girls is impossible, for they have "staunchly, and problematically, resisted being surveyed as to the makeup of their own membership."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Several Guerrilla Girls who are people of color have faced numerous challenges. Despite the Guerrilla Girls' stance against tokenism, some artists of color abandoned Guerrilla Girl membership due to [[tokenism]], silencing, disrespect, and [[Whitewashing (censorship)|whitewashing]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":45" /&gt; As a woman of color, "Alma Thomas" describes having felt uncomfortable wearing the Guerrilla Girls' signature gorilla mask.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.aaa.si.edu/collections/interviews/oral-history-interview-guerrilla-girls-jane-bowles-and-alma-thomas-15838|title=Oral history interview with Guerrilla Girls Jane Bowles and Alma Thomas, 2008 May 8 - Oral Histories {{!}} Archives of American Art, Smithsonian Institution|last=Richards|first=Judith Olch|last2=Bowles|first2=Jane|date=2008-05-08|website=www.aaa.si.edu|access-date=2016-06-07|last3=Thomas|first3=Alma}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Thomas" recalls little effort being devoted to understanding the challenges of artists of color. "Their whiteness was such that they. ...   didn't understand that blacks were being put in a completely separate world in the art world, that black male artists and black female artists are completely separated, completely segregated to this day."&lt;ref name=":45" /&gt; Ultimately, this widespread antagonism led to many "artists of color [leaving] after a few meetings because they could sense the unspoken hierarchy in the group."&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Stein|first=Gertrude|date=Summer 2011|title=Guerrilla Girls and Guerrilla Girls BroadBand: Inside Story|jstor=41430727|journal=Art Journal|doi=|pmid=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Second-wave feminism and essentialism ===
[[File:Good Luck getting that estrogen bomb.jpg|thumb|Anonymous MCAD student protest against the Guerrilla Girls]]Emerging at the tail end of the [[Second-wave feminism|second-wave feminist movement]], the Guerrilla Girls navigated the differences between established and emerging feminist theory during the 1980s. "Alma Thomas" describes this grey-area that the Guerrilla Girls occupied as "universalist feminism," bordering on [[Gender essentialism|essentialism]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Art Historian Anna Chave considers the Guerrilla Girls' essentialism much more profound, leading the group to be "assailed by ... a rising generation of women wise in the ways of poststructuralist theory, for [their] putative naiveté and susceptibility to essentialism."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Essentialist views are most clearly exhibited in two Guerrilla Girl books:''The Guerrilla Girls Bedside Companion to the History of Western Art'' (1998) and the controversial ''Estrogen Bomb'' (2003–13) campaign. Regarding the former, "Alma Thomas" worried that ''The Guerrilla Girls Bedside Companion to the History of Western Art'' "was so embedded in that second-wave feminist and even pre-second-wave essentialism" that it fulfilled some assumption that all women artists are feminist artists.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Students at [[Minneapolis College of Art and Design]] criticized their ''Estrogen Bomb'' poster campaign, describing it as insensitive towards transgender people since it ties the female gender to estrogen, the same sort of essentialist link the Guerilla Girls aim to critique.&lt;ref&gt;Cherneff, Lila, 2015-12-28, "Guerrilla Girls Stumble at MCAD," Radio Program, https://soundcloud.com/minneculture/guerrilla-girls-stumble-at-mcad, 2016-05-31, KFAI&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.tcdailyplanet.net/guerrilla-girls-exclusionary-feminism/|title=The Guerrilla Girls, 'estrogen bombs' and exclusionary feminism|last=Jones|first=Hannah|date=2016-04-20|website=Twin Cities Daily Planet|publisher=Adaobi Okolue|language=en-US|access-date=2016-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aside from essentialism, the Guerrilla Girls have also been critiqued for failing to integrate [[intersectionality]] into their work.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

=== Internal disputes ===
Leading up to a highly publicized 2003 lawsuit, there was increasing animosity toward "Frida Kahlo" and "Käthe Kollwitz." Despite founding members' initial intention to create a non-hierarchal, equitable power structure, there was an increasing sense that two people were making "the final decisions no matter what you said."&lt;ref name=":45" /&gt; Several Guerrilla Girls felt that their second book, ''The Guerrilla Girls Bedside Companion to the History of Western Art'', primarily represented the views of "Kahlo" and "Kollwitz". Some even felt that "Kahlo" and "Kollwitz" completely controlled the book, despite their having selected material created collectively by all Guerrilla Girls. There was even suspicion that these two not only claimed all the credit, but took all of the profits. Some members condemned the book as "undemocratic and ... against the spirit of the [Guerrilla] Girls."&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

As the Guerilla Girls gained in popularity, tensions led to what the Girls later called the "banana split," as five members actually split from the collective. Soon after several members stepped aside to form Guerrilla Girls Broadband, "Kahlo" and "Kollwitz" moved to trademark the name "Guerrilla Girls, Inc." to distinguish their realm from those of Guerrilla Girls BroadBand and [[Guerrilla Girls On Tour|Guerrilla Girls On Tour!]], whose focus is discrimination in the theater world.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Even though their former colleague "Gertrude Stein" was in the on-tour group, "Kahlo" and "Kollwitz" charged them with copyright and trademark infringement and unjust enrichment. Many members of the group felt especially betrayed that "Kahlo" and "Kollwitz" had launched their lawsuit under their real names, Jerilea Zempel and Erika Rothenberg.&lt;ref name="Jeffrey Toobin 2005"&gt;Jeffrey Toobin. "Girls Behaving Badly."''New Yorker''. May 30, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

This prompted negative reactions from both current and former Guerrilla Girls, who objected to "Kahlo" and "Kollwitz" claiming responsibility for having created the collective effort, as well as the flippancy with which they exchanged their anonymity for legal standing.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

[[Louis L. Stanton|Judge Louis L. Stanton]], who handled the case, rejected the "bizarre" suggestion that defendants sporting gorilla masks be allowed to testify in his courtroom. He also stated that "Mundane court procedures for adjudicating legal rights and the ownership of property require direct and cross-examination of real persons with real addresses and attributes."&lt;ref name="Jeffrey Toobin 2005"/&gt;

In their forty-five page complaint, "Kahlo" and "Kollwitz" described themselves as the group's "guiding forces," even though the Guerrilla Girls were "informally organized, [and] had no official hierarchy." Initially, they asked the court to stop Guerrilla Girls Broadband from calling themselves Guerrilla Girls and sought millions of dollars in damages. In 2006, they settled with the theatre group who agreed to go by Guerrilla Girls on Tour.

=== Selling-out ===
Upon their 1985 debut, the Guerrilla Girls were "lauded by the very establishment they sought to undermine." They have since exhibited at Tate Modern, Venice Biennale, Centre Pompidou, MoMA, which additionally grants them a broader audience for their concerns.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/guerrilla-girl-power-have-americas-feminist-artists-sold-out-1666140.html|title=Guerrilla girl power: Have America's feminist artists sold out?|last=Adams|first=Guy|date=2009-04-08|website=The Independent|publisher=Independent Print Limited|language=en-GB|access-date=2016-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, this relationship has only intensified, as the Guerrilla Girls presented their exhibitions in museums and even allowed their works to be collected by hegemonic institutions. Although some have questioned the efficacy, if not hypocrisy, of the group's working within the system that they originally denigrated, few would challenge their decision to let the Getty Institute house their archives.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

==Members and names==
[[File:2016GuerrillaGirlsRochesterArtCenter.jpg|thumb|left|Two members of the Guerrilla Girls join a panel discussion at the Rochester Art Center in 2016 in Rochester, Minnesota]]

Membership in the New York City group is by invitation only, based on relationships with current and past members, and one's involvement in the [[contemporary art]] world. A [[mentoring]] program was formed within the group, pairing a new member with an experienced Guerrilla Girl to bring them into the fold. Due to the lack of formality, the group is comfortable with individuals outside of their base claiming to be Guerrilla Girls; Guerrilla Girl 1 stated in a 2007 interview: "It can only enhance us by having people of power who have been given credit for being a Girl, even if they were never a Girl." Men are not allowed to become Guerrilla Girls, but may support the group by assisting in promotional activities.&lt;ref name="Oral1" /&gt;

Guerrilla Girls names are [[wikt:pseudonym|pseudonyms]] generally based on dead female artists. Members goes by names such as [[Kathe Kollwitz]], [[Alma Thomas]], [[Rosalba Carriera]], [[Frida Kahlo]], [[Alice Neel]], [[Julia de Burgos]], and [[Hannah Höch]]. Guerrilla Girls' "Carriera" is credited with the idea of using pseudonyms as a way to not forget female artists. Having read about Rosalba Carriera in a footnote of ''Letters on Cézanne'' by [[Rainer Maria Rilke]], she decided to pay tribute to the little-known female artist with her name. This also helped to solve the problem of media interviews; the group was often interviewed by phone and would not give names, causing problems and confusion amongst the group and the media. Guerrilla Girl 1 joined in the late 1980s, taking on her name as a way to memorialize women in the art community who have fallen under the radar and did not make as notable as an impact as the names takes on by other members.&lt;ref name="Oral1"&gt;{{cite web | author=Judith Olch Richards | year=2007 | title=Interview with Guerrilla Girls Rosalba Carriera and Guerrilla Girl 1  | work= | publisher=Archives of American Art | url=http://www.aaa.si.edu/collections/interviews/oral-history-interview-guerrilla-girls-rosalba-carriera-and-guerrilla-girl-1-15843 | accessdate=10 Jun 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gorilla symbolism==
[[File:Kingkongposter.jpg|thumb|270x270px|The 1933 film ''King Kong'' was influential to the concept of a Guerilla Girl.]]
The idea to adopt the gorilla as the group's symbol stemmed from a spelling error. One of the first Guerrilla Girls accidentally spelled the group's name at a meeting as "gorilla."&lt;ref name="guerrillagirls.com" /&gt; Despite the fact that the idea of using a gorilla as group symbol might have been accidental, the choice is nevertheless pertinent to the group's overall message in several key ways.

To begin with, the gorilla in popular culture and media is often associated with [[King Kong]], or other images of trapped and tamed apes. In the 2010 SAIC Commencement, the comparison between institutionalized artists and tamed apes was explicitly made:

&lt;blockquote&gt; And last, but not least, be a great ape. In 1917, Franz Kafka wrote a short story titled ''A Report to An Academy'', in which an ape spoke about what it was like to be taken into captivity by a bunch of educated, intellectual types. The published story ends with the ape tamed and broken by the stultified academics. But in an earlier draft, Kafka tells a different story. The ape ends his report by instructing other apes NOT to allow themselves to be tamed. He says instead: break the bars of your cages, bite a hole through them, squeeze through an opening ... and ask yourself where do YOU want to go&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.guerrillagirls.com/books/images/SAICcommencement5%2022%2010.pdf |title=School of the Art Institute of Chicago Commencement Address |publisher=Guerrillagirls.com |date=May 22, 2010 |accessdate=2014-01-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131005181705/http://www.guerrillagirls.com/books/images/SAICcommencement5%2022%2010.pdf |archivedate=October 5, 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Guerillagirlad.png|left|thumb|210x210px|This is Guerrilla Girl ad using an Ingres image with the trademark gorilla mask with facts about gender inequality in the art industry.]] --&gt;
The gorilla is also typically associated with masculinity. The Met. Museum poster is in part shocking because of its juxtaposition of the eroticized female [[odalisque]] body, and the large, snarling gorilla head. The addition of the head detracts from the male [[gaze]] and changes the way in which viewers are able to look at or understand the highly sexualized image. Further, the addition of the gorilla questions and modifies stereotypical notions of female beauty within Western art and popular culture, another stated goal of the Guerrilla Girls. [[File:Jean Auguste Dominique Ingres, La Grande Odalisque, 1814.jpg|thumbnail|The original image by Ingres without the addition of the gorilla head represents the kind of art that the Guerrilla Girls take issues with, like the common issues of exoticism and sexualization of women.|left|199x199px]]

&lt;blockquote&gt;Guerrilla Girls, who wear the masks of big, hairy, powerful jungle creatures whose beauty is hardly conventional ... believe all animals, large and small, are beautiful in their own way.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Girls|first=Guerrilla|title=Bitches, Bimbos, and Ballbreakers: The Guerrilla Girls' Illustrated Guide to Female Stereotypes'|year=2003|publisher=Penguin|location=London|isbn=978-0-14-200101-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Though this goal has never been explicitly stated by the group, in the history of Western art, primates have often been associated with the visual arts, and with the figure of the artist. The idea of ''ars simia naturae'' ("art the ape of nature") maintains that the job of art is to "ape", or faithfully copy and represent nature. This was an idea first popularized by Renaissance thinker [[Giovanni Boccaccio]] who alleged that "the artist in imitating nature only follows Nature's own command."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Jason|first=H.W.|title=Apes and Ape Lore in the Renaissance and Middle Ages|year=1952|publisher=The Warburg Institute, University of London|location=London|page=291}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Hans Schwarz''', (29 December 1922 – 28 May 2003) was a prolific Austrian artist, who spent most of his life in Britain and was notable for his portrait painting, several examples of which are held by the [[National Portrait Gallery, London|National Portrait Gallery]] in London. Schwarz was [[Jewish]] and was forced to leave Austria in 1938 when the Nazis took over and he went into exile in Britain.&lt;ref name=APayne&gt;{{cite web |author=Alice Payne|url=http://www.artuk.org/discover/stories/five-artists-who-fled-their-country-of-origin/ |title=Five artists who fled their country of origin|date=30 August 2016|accessdate=5 September 2016|work=Art UK}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Schwarz was born in Vienna to Jewish parents. His mother died when he was 12 years old, two years before he entered art school in Vienna. With the [[Anschluss]], in 1938, Schwarz was forced to abandon his studies. Shortly, afterwards he left Austria aboard a [[Kindertransport]] and made his way to England. His father, a bank clerk, failed to escape Vienna and later died in the [[Auschwitz concentration camp]].&lt;ref name=SFenwick&gt;{{cite web |author=Simon Fenwick|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/hans-schwarz-36602.html|title=Obituary:Hans Schwarz|date=6 June 2003|accessdate=5 September 2016|work=[[The Independent]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Arriving in England, the young Schwarz worked as a labourer for a year at [[Bournville]] before he was interned on the [[Isle of Man]] as an [[enemy alien]]. When he was released from internment in 1941, Schwarz enrolled at the [[Birmingham College of Art]] and studied there until 1943.&lt;ref name="BuckmanVol2"&gt;{{cite book|author=David Buckman|publisher=Art Dictionaries Ltd|year=1998|title=Artists in Britain Since 1945 Vol 2, M to Z |ISBN=0 95326 095 X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Schwarz then spent two years working in a commercial art studio before, when the Second World War ended, establishing himself as a freelance commercial illustrator.&lt;ref name=SFenwick/&gt; He completed several murals for public buildings and also some work for the 1951 [[Festival of Britain]].&lt;ref name=Estate&gt;{{cite web |author=|url=http://hansschwarz.co.uk/biography/|title=Biography: Hans Schwarz|year=2014|accessdate=6 September 2016|work=hansschwarz.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; For almost twenty years Schwarz worked for several high-profile clients, including [[Royal Dutch Shell|Shell]], the Post Office and [[British Overseas Airways Corporation|BOAC]], until in 1964 he decided to concentrate full-time on his painting and sculpture.&lt;ref name=CourtG&gt;{{cite web |author=|url=http://www.courtgallery.com/artists/Schwarz.html|title=Hans Schwarz 1922-2003|year=|accessdate=6 September 2016|work=The Court Gallery}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1966 Schwarz and his family moved to Somerset, from [[Hampstead]], where he expanded the range of his work, painting more landscapes, undertaking more sculptures and using watercolours for the first time.&lt;ref name=Estate/&gt;
 
From 1970 until his death, Schwarz lived and worked in [[Greenwich]] and produced some of his finest work at his studio there. In 1984 the National Portrait Gallery commissioned Schwarz to produce a group portrait of several trade union leaders.&lt;ref name=M1gall&gt;{{cite web |author=|url=http://www.m1fineart.com/news/?post_id=33
|title=Hans Schwarz (1922-2003) - The Greenwich Years|date=11 September 2015|accessdate=6 September 2016|work=M1 Fine Art}}&lt;/ref&gt; The resulting picture of [[Joe Gormley (trade unionist)|Joe Gormley]], [[Sidney Weighell|Sid Weighell]] and [[Thomas Jackson (trade unionist)|Tom Jackson]] in [[Trafalgar Square]] with pigeons flying around them is possibly his best known work. Other notable portraits by Schwarz from this period include depictions of [[Janet Suzman]], [[Nikolaus Pevsner]] and the poet [[Ivor Cutler]].&lt;ref name=M1gall/&gt; From Greenwich, Schwarz painted several urban landscapes often featuring the streets in his immediate vicinity but also [[Canary Wharf]] and the [[Isle of Dogs]]. Schwarz wrote several books on artistic techniques and, with his wife Lena, a book on the [[Halesowen]] district of the West Midlands.&lt;ref name=Estate/&gt;

In 1981, Schwarz won the [[Hunting Art Prize]] for a watercolour painting. Throughout the 1980s and 1990s he held a number of well-received exhibitions at commercial galleries. These included a series at the Thackeray Gallery and individual shows at the Compton Gallery in 1983, the [[Ben Uri Gallery]] in 1985, the Woodlands Art Gallery in 1991, the [[Sternberg Centre]] in 1992 and the New Academy Gallery in both 1995 and 2001. The auction house [[Bonhams]] sold the contents of his studio in 2004.&lt;ref name="BuckmanVol2"/&gt;

'' '''Hoofdletters, Tweeling- en Meerlingdruk''' ''was a Dutch book published in 1958. In the book, author Dr. [[George van den Bergh]] made several propositions for a more economical arrangement of type in books. The book was featured in [[Herbert Spencer (graphic designer)|Herbert Spencer]]'s ''[[Typographica]]'' (Old Series, number 16, 1959) in and [[Eye (magazine)|''Eye'' magazine]] [[List of Eye magazine issues|(no. 47, vol. 12, Spring 2003)]]. [http://www.eyemagazine.com/feature.php?id=85&amp;fid=451] In [[Rick Poynor]]'s ''Typographica'' he translates the Dutch title as "Capitals, twin- and multi-print." &lt;ref&gt;''Typographica'', p. 131, by [[Rick Poynor]], Princeton Architectural Press, New York, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

There were three principles in van den Bergh's proposals. The first was that printing in all caps (''Hoofdletters'' in Dutch means [[uppercase]] letters) would save the space wasted by the ascenders and descenders of [[lowercase]] letters. The second principle involved double printing texts that could be screened by overlaying sheets that masked every other line of text. The third principle involved double printing texts in red and green: the reader could then read through red or green "spectacles" that filtered out one text.

Erik Kindel, author of the 2003 ''Eye'' article sums up with a contemporary evaluation of the book:
{{cquote|Casting a cold eye over ''Hoofdletters, Tweeling- en Meerlingdruk'', it is difficult to see it as anything more than an earnest but bizarre solution to what was undoubtedly a real problem in postwar Europe, and the Netherlands in particular. Most designers, typographers and readers will probably find its technically deterministic contravention of long-established typographic practice merely naïve, resulting in a harmless curiosity that merits little consideration, only incredulity. But if ''Hoofdletters'' is designated a practical failure, a typography in extremis, something stops us from dismissing it out of hand. With a warmer eye it resolves into an enlightening object of mirth. While there is no indication that Van den Bergh regarded Hoofdletters with anything but complete seriousness, 45 years on it, too, operates, if accidentally, as an ingenious satire – on the preoccupations of legibility research, or the promise of technology so readily associated with the period of its invention"&lt;ref&gt;''Eye'', Number 47, Volume 12, Spring 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

'''Insular art''', also known as '''Hiberno-Saxon art''', is the style of art produced in the [[sub-Roman Britain|post-Roman history]] of [[Ireland]] and [[Great Britain|Britain]]. The term derives from ''insula'', the [[Latin language|Latin]] term for "island"; in this period Britain and Ireland shared a largely common style different from that of the rest of Europe. Art historians usually group insular art as part of the [[Migration Period art]] movement as well as Early Medieval Western art, and it is the combination of these two traditions that gives the style its special character.&lt;ref&gt;Honour &amp; Fleming, 244–247; Pächt, 65–66; Walies &amp; Zoll, 27–30&lt;/ref&gt;

Most Insular art originates from the [[Hiberno-Scottish mission|Irish monastic]] movement of [[Celtic Christianity]], or metalwork for the secular elite, and the period begins around 600 with the combining of [[Celtic art|Celtic]] and [[Anglo-Saxon art|Anglo-Saxon]] styles. One major distinctive feature is [[interlace (art)|interlace]] decoration, in particular the [[interlace (visual arts)|interlace]] decoration as found at [[Sutton Hoo]], in [[East Anglia]], which is now applied to decorating new types of objects mostly copied from the Mediterranean world, above all the [[codex]] or book.&lt;ref&gt;No manuscripts are commonly dated before 600, but some jewellery, mostly Irish, is dated to the 6th century. Youngs 20–22. The early history of Anglo-Saxon metalwork is dominated by the early-7th-century finds at [[Sutton Hoo]], but it is clear these were the product of a well-established tradition of which only smaller pieces survive. Wilson, 16–27. The earliest Pictish stones may date from the fifth century however. Laing, 55–56.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The finest period of the style was brought to an end by the disruption to monastic centres and aristocratic life of the [[Viking expansion|Viking raids]] which began in the late 8th century.  These are presumed to have interrupted work on the [[Book of Kells]], and no later Gospel books are as heavily or finely illuminated as the masterpieces of the 8th century.&lt;ref&gt;Dodwell (1993), 85, 90; Wilson, 141&lt;/ref&gt; In England the style merged into [[Anglo-Saxon art]] around 900, whilst in Ireland the style continued until the 12th century, when it merged into [[Romanesque art]].&lt;ref&gt;Ryan&lt;/ref&gt; Ireland, [[Scotland]] and the kingdom of [[Northumbria]] in northern England are the most important centres, but examples were found also in southern England, Wales&lt;ref&gt;The late [[Ricemarch Psalter]] is certainly Welsh in origin, and the much earlier [[Hereford Gospels]] is believed by many to be Welsh (see Grove Art Online, S2); the 10th-century [[Book of Deer]], the earliest manuscript with [[Scottish Gaelic]], is an Insular product of eastern Scotland (Grove).&lt;/ref&gt; and in Continental Europe, especially [[Gaul]] (modern France), in centres founded by the [[Hiberno-Scottish mission]] and Anglo-Saxon missions. The influence of insular art affected all subsequent European medieval art, especially in the decorative elements of Romanesque and Gothic manuscripts.&lt;ref&gt;Henderson, 63–71&lt;/ref&gt;

Surviving examples of Insular art are mainly [[illuminated manuscript]]s, metalwork and carvings in stone, especially [[High cross|stone crosses]].  Surfaces are highly decorated with intricate patterning, with no attempt to give an impression of depth, volume or recession.  The best examples include the [[Book of Kells]], [[Lindisfarne Gospels]], [[Book of Durrow]], brooches such as the [[Tara Brooch]] and the [[Ruthwell Cross]]. [[Carpet pages]] are a characteristic feature of Insular manuscripts, although [[historiated initial]]s (an Insular invention), [[canon table]]s and figurative miniatures, especially [[Evangelist portrait]]s, are also common.

==Use of the term==
The term was derived from its use for [[Insular script]], first cited by the ''[[OED]]'' in 1908,&lt;ref&gt;[[OED]] "Insular" 4 b., though as it seems clear from their 1908 quotation that the use of the term was already established; [[Carola Hicks]] dates the first use to 1901.&lt;/ref&gt; and is also used for the group of [[Insular Celtic languages]] by linguists.&lt;ref&gt;Apparently a more recent usage from the ?1970s on, in works such as {{cite book| last=Cowgill |first=Warren |authorlink=Warren Cowgill |year=1975 |chapter=The origins of the Insular Celtic conjunct and absolute verbal endings |editor=H. Rix (ed.) |title=Flexion und Wortbildung: Akten der V. Fachtagung der Indogermanischen Gesellschaft, Regensburg, 9.–14. September 1973 |location=Wiesbaden |pages=40–70 |publisher=Reichert |isbn=978-3-920153-40-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Initially used mainly to describe the style of decoration of illuminated manuscripts, which are certainly the most numerous type of major surviving objects using the style, it is now used more widely across all the arts.  It has the advantage of recognising the unity of styles across the Britain and Ireland, while avoiding the use of the term ''[[British Isles]]'', a sensitive topic in Ireland, and also circumventing arguments about the origins of the style, and the place of creation of specific works, which were often fierce in the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;Schapiro, 225–241, Nordenfalk, 11–14, Wailes &amp; Zoll, 25–38, Wilson, 32–36, give accounts of some of these scholarly controversies; [[Oxford Art Online]] "Insular art", [http://www.enotes.com/oxford-art-encyclopedia/insular-art The Oxford Dictionary of Art] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090905081448/http://www.enotes.com/oxford-art-encyclopedia/insular-art |date=5 September 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some sources distinguish between a "wider period between the 5th and 11th centuries, from the departure of the Romans to the beginnings of the Romanesque style" and a "more specific phase from the 6th to 9th centuries, between the conversion to Christianity and the Viking settlements".&lt;ref&gt;Hicks&lt;/ref&gt; C. R. Dodwell, on the other hand, says that in Ireland "the Insular style continued almost unchallenged until the [[Norman invasion of Ireland|Anglo-Norman invasion of 1170]]; indeed examples of it occur even as late as the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries".&lt;ref&gt;Dodwell (1993), 90.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Insular decoration==
[[File:KellsDecoratedInitial.jpg|thumb|right|One of hundreds of small initials from the ''Book of Kells'']]
The Insular style is most famous for its highly dense, intricate and imaginative decoration, which takes elements from several earlier styles.  Late [[Iron Age]] Celtic art or "Ultimate [[La Tène style|La Tène]]", gave the love of spirals, [[triskele]]s, circles and other geometric motifs. These were combined with animal forms probably mainly deriving from the Germanic version of the general [[Eurasia]]n [[animal style]], though also from Celtic art, where heads terminating scrolls were common. [[Interlace (visual arts)|Interlace]] was used by both these traditions, as well as Roman art (for example in floor [[mosaic]]s) and other possible influences such as [[Coptic art]], and its use was taken to new levels in insular art, where it was combined with the other elements already mentioned.  There is no attempt to represent depth in manuscript painting, with all the emphasis on a brilliantly patterned surface.  In early works the human figure was shown in the same geometric fashion as animal figures, but reflections of a classical figure style spread as the period went on, probably mostly from the southern Anglo-Saxon regions, though northern areas also had direct contacts with the Continent.&lt;ref&gt;Grove, Wilson, 38–40, Nordenfalk, 13–26, Calkins Chapter 1, Laing 346–351&lt;/ref&gt; The origins of the overall format of the carpet page have often been related to Roman floor mosaics,&lt;ref&gt;Henderson, 97–100&lt;/ref&gt; Coptic carpets and manuscript paintings,&lt;ref&gt;Nordenfalk, 19–22, Schapiro, 205–206&lt;/ref&gt; without general agreement being reached among scholars.

==Background==
[[File:Sutton.Hoo.ShoulderClasp2.RobRoy.jpg|thumb|Early Anglo-Saxon shoulder-clasps from [[Sutton Hoo]], early 7th century. Gold, garnet, and [[millefiori]] glass.]]
Unlike contemporary [[Byzantine art]], and that of most major periods, insular art does not come from a society where common stylistic influences were spread across a great number of types of object in art, [[applied art]] and [[decorative art]].  Across all the islands society was effectively entirely rural, buildings were rudimentary, and architecture has no Insular style.  Although related objects in many more perishable media certainly existed and have not survived, it is clear that both religious and secular Insular patrons expected individual objects of dazzling virtuousity, that were all the more dazzling because of the lack of visual sophistication in the world in which they were seen.&lt;ref&gt;Henderson 48–55, Dodwell, 19 and throughout Chapter 7&lt;/ref&gt;

Especially in Ireland, the clerical and secular elites were often very closely linked; some Irish [[Abbot|abbacies]] were held for generations among a small kin-group.&lt;ref&gt;Youngs, 13–14&lt;/ref&gt; Ireland was divided into very small "kingdoms", almost too many for historians to keep track of, whilst in Britain there was a smaller number of generally larger kingdoms. Both the Celtic (Irish and [[Pict]]ish) and Anglo-Saxon elites had long traditions of metalwork of the finest quality, much of it used for the personal adornment of both sexes of the elite. The Insular style arises from the meeting of their two styles, Celtic and Anglo-Saxon [[animal style]], in a Christian context, and with some awareness of Late Antique style. This was especially so in their application to the book, which was a new type of object for both traditions, as well as to metalwork.&lt;ref&gt;Youngs, 15–16, 72; Nordenfalk, 7–11, Pächt, 65–66&lt;/ref&gt;

The role of the [[Kingdom of Northumbria]] in the formation of the new style appears to have been pivotal.  The northernmost Anglo-Saxon kingdom continued to expand into areas with Celtic populations, but often leaving those populations largely intact in areas such as [[Dál Riata]], [[Elmet]] and the [[Kingdom of Strathclyde]]. The Irish monastery at [[Iona]] was established by Saint [[Columba]] (Colum Cille) in 563, when Iona was part of a Dál Riata that included territory in both Ireland and modern Scotland. Although the first conversion of a Northumbrian king, that of [[Edwin of Northumbria|Edwin]] in 627, was effected by clergy from the [[Gregorian Mission]] to Kent, it was the [[Celtic Christianity]] of Iona that was initially more influential in Northumbria, founding [[Lindisfarne]] on the eastern coast as a satellite in 635.  However Northumbria remained in direct contact with Rome and other important monastic centres were founded by [[Wilfrid]] and [[Benedict Biscop]] who looked to Rome, and at the [[Synod of Whitby]] it was the Roman practices that were upheld, while the Iona contingent walked out, not adopting the Roman Easter dating until 715.&lt;ref&gt;Nordenfalk, 8–9; Schapiro, 167–173&lt;/ref&gt;

==Insular metalwork==
[[File:Derrynaflan paten.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Derrynaflan paten]], 8th or 9th century.]]
Christianity discouraged the burial of grave goods so that, at least from the Anglo-Saxons, we have a larger number of pre-Christian survivals than those from later periods.&lt;ref&gt;Dodwell (1982), 4&lt;/ref&gt; The majority of examples that survive from the Christian period have been found in archaeological contexts that suggest they were rapidly hidden, lost or abandoned. There are a few exceptions, notably portable [[shrine]]s ("[[cumdach]]s") for books or [[relic]]s, several of which have been continuously owned, mostly by churches on the Continent—though the [[Monymusk Reliquary]] has always been in Scotland.&lt;ref&gt;Youngs, 134–140 catalogues two examples from Italy and one from Norway. See also Laing, who describes major pieces by period and area at various points.&lt;/ref&gt; In general it is clear that most survivals are only by chance, and that we have only fragments of some types of object—in particular the largest and least portable. The highest quality survivals are either secular jewellery, the largest and most elaborate pieces probably for male wearers, or tableware or altarware in what were apparently very similar styles—some pieces cannot be confidently assigned between altar and royal dining-table.  It seems possible, even likely, that the finest church pieces were made by secular workshops, often attached to a royal household, though other pieces were made by monastic workshops.&lt;ref&gt;Youngs, 15–16, 125&lt;/ref&gt; The evidence suggests that Irish metalworkers produced most of the best pieces,&lt;ref&gt;Youngs, 53&lt;/ref&gt; however the finds from the royal burial at [[Sutton Hoo]], from the far east of England and at the beginning of the period, are as fine in design and workmanship as any Irish pieces.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, 16–25&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Ardagh chalice.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Ardagh Chalice]], c.? 750]]

There are a number of large brooches, including several of comparable quality to the [[Tara brooch]].  Almost all of these are in the [[National Museum of Ireland]], the [[British Museum]], the [[National Museum of Scotland]], or local museums in the islands.  Each of their designs is wholly individual in detail, and the workmanship is varied in technique and superb in quality.  Many elements of the designs can be directly related to elements used in manuscripts.  Almost all of the many techniques known in metalwork can be found in Insular work.  Surviving stones used in decoration are semi-precious ones, with [[amber]] and [[rock crystal]] among the commonest, and some [[garnet]]s.  Coloured glass, [[Vitreous enamel|enamel]] and [[millefiori]] glass, probably imported, are also used.&lt;ref&gt;Youngs, 72–115, and 170–174 on techniques; Ryan, Michael in [[Oxford Art Online]], S2, Wilson, 113–114, 120–130&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Ardagh Chalice]] and the [[Derrynaflan Chalice|Derrynaflan]] Hoard of chalice, [[paten]] with stand, strainer, and basin (only discovered in 1980) are the most outstanding pieces of church metalware to survive (only three other chalices, and no other paten, survive).  These pieces are thought to come from the 8th or 9th century, but most dating of metalwork is uncertain, and comes largely from comparison with manuscripts.  Only fragments remain from what were probably large pieces of church furniture, probably with metalwork on wooden frameworks, such as shrines, crosses and other items.&lt;ref&gt;Youngs, 125–130, and catalogue entries following, including the Derrynaflan Hoard.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Cross of Cong]] is a 12th-century Irish processional cross and [[reliquary]] that shows insular decoration, possibly added in a deliberately revivalist spirit.&lt;ref&gt;Rigby, 562&lt;/ref&gt; The [[gilt-bronze]] "[[Athlone]] Crucifixion Plaque" ([[National Museum of Ireland]], perhaps 8th century) is much the best known of a group of nine recorded Irish metal plaques with ''Crucifixions'', and is comparable in style to figures on many high crosses; it may well have come from a book cover.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, Ruth. ''Irish Crucifixion Plaques: Viking Age or Romanesque?'', The Journal of the Royal Society of Antiquaries of Ireland, Vol. 128, (1998), pp. 95–106. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/25549845 JSTOR]. [http://gravelwalks.com/files/Bronze_Plaque_from_Athlone.jpg Image] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110711123122/http://gravelwalks.com/files/Bronze_Plaque_from_Athlone.jpg |date=11 July 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The fittings of a major abbey church in the insular period remain hard to imagine; one thing that does seem clear is that the most fully decorated manuscripts were treated as decorative objects for display rather than as books for study.  The most fully decorated of all, the Book of Kells, has several mistakes left uncorrected, the text headings necessary to make the Canon tables usable have not been added, and when it was stolen in 1006 for its cover in precious metals, it was taken from the [[sacristy]], not the library.  The book was recovered, but not the cover, as also happened with the Book of Lindisfarne.  None of the major insular manuscripts have preserved their elaborate jewelled metal covers, but we know from documentary evidence that these were as spectacular as the few remaining continental examples.&lt;ref&gt;Calkins 57–60. The 8th-century pocket gospel book [[Book of Dimma]] has a fine 12th-century cover.&lt;/ref&gt; The re-used metal back cover of the [[Lindau Gospels]] (now in the [[Morgan Library]], New York&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.themorgan.org/collections/collections.asp?id=70|title=Gospel Book|author=|date=13 July 2017|website=themorgan.org|accessdate=9 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140709172139/http://www.themorgan.org/collections/collections.asp?id=70|archivedate=9 July 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;) was made in southern Germany in the late 8th or early 9th? century, under heavy insular influence, and is perhaps the best indication as to the appearance of the original covers of the great insular manuscripts, although one gold and garnet piece from the Anglo-Saxon [[Staffordshire Hoard]], found in 2009, may be the corner of a book-cover.  The Lindau design is dominated by a cross, but the whole surface of the cover is decorated, with interlace panels between the arms of the cross.  The [[cloisonné]] enamel shows Italian influence, and is not found in work from the Insular homelands, but the overall effect is very like a carpet page.&lt;ref&gt;Lasko, 8–9, and plate 2; [http://www.themorgan.org/collections/collections.asp?id=67 Lindau Gospels cover] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100613042530/http://themorgan.org/collections/collections.asp?id=67 |date=13 June 2010 }}, from Morgan Library&lt;/ref&gt;

==Insular manuscripts==
[[File:CathachOfStColumba.jpg|thumb|upright|Cathach of St. Columba, 7th century]]
{{main|Insular illumination}}
Although many more examples survive than of large pieces of metalwork, the development of the style is usually described in terms of the same outstanding examples:

'''[[Cathach of St. Columba]]'''.
An Irish Latin [[psalter]] of the early 7th century,&lt;ref&gt;Or "the second half of the sixth century" according to Schapiro, 229. Calkins, 31–32 gives no date, Nordenfalk, 12–13 says 7th century.&lt;/ref&gt; this is perhaps the oldest known Irish manuscript of any sort.  It contains only decorated letters, at the beginning of each Psalm, but these already show distinctive traits.  Not just the initial, but the first few letters are decorated, at diminishing sizes.  The decoration influences the shape of the letters, and various decorative forms are mixed in a very unclassical way. Lines are already inclined to spiral and metamorphose, as in the example shown. Apart from black, some orange ink is used for dotted decoration.  The classical tradition was late to use capital letters for initials at all (in Roman texts it is often very hard to even separate the words), and though by this time they were in common use in Italy, they were often set in the left margin, as though to cut them off from the rest of the text.  The insular tendency for the decoration to lunge into the text, and take over more and more of it, was a radical innovation.&lt;ref&gt;Pächt, 63–64, in his chapter on the initial, which gives a thorough treatment of the subject. Nordenfalk, 12–13 has other images.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Bobbio Jerome]] which according to an inscription dates to before 622, from [[Bobbio Abbey]], an Irish mission centre in northern Italy, has a more elaborate initial with colouring, showing Insular characteristics still more developed, even in such an outpost. From the same [[scriptorium]] and of similar date, the [[Bobbio Orosius]] has the earliest [[carpet page]], although a relatively simple one.&lt;ref&gt;Schapiro, 227–229; Wilson, 60&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:BookOfDurrowBeginMarkGospel.jpg|thumb|left|upright|The beginning of the Gospel of Mark from the Book of Durrow.]]

'''[[Gospel Book Fragment (Durham Cathedral Library, A. II. 10.)|Durham Gospel Book Fragment]]'''.
The earliest painted Insular manuscript to survive, produced in [[Lindisfarne]] c. 650, but with only seven leaves of the book remaining, not all with illuminations. This introduces interlace, and also uses Celtic motifs drawn from metalwork. The design of two of the surviving pages relates them as a two-page spread&lt;ref&gt;Calkins, 32–33; Nordenfalk, 14–15, 28, 32–33&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Book of Durrow]]'''.
The earliest surviving Gospel Book with a full programme of decoration (though not all has survived): six extant carpet pages, a full-page miniature of the four evangelist's symbols, four full-page miniatures of the evangelists' symbols, four pages with very large initials, and decorated text on other pages.  Many minor initial groups are decorated.  Its date and place of origin remain subjects of debate, with 650–690 and [[Durrow, County Offaly|Durrow]] in Ireland, [[Iona]] or [[Lindisfarne]] being the normal contenders.  The influences on the decoration are also highly controversial, especially regarding [[Copt]]ic or other Near Eastern influence.&lt;ref&gt;Calkins, 33–63 gives a full account with many illustrations; Nordenfalk, 34–47, and 19–22 on Coptic influences; see also Schapiro Index (under Dublin), Wilson, 32–36 and index.&lt;/ref&gt;

After large initials the following letters on the same line, or for some lines beyond, continue to be decorated at a smaller size.  Dots round the outside of large initials are much used.  The figures are highly stylised, and some pages use Germanic interlaced animal ornament, whilst others use the full repertoire of Celtic geometric spirals. Each page uses a different and coherent set of decorative motifs. Only four colours are used, but the viewer is hardly conscious of any limitation from this.  All the elements of Insular manuscript style are already in place. The execution, though of high quality, is not as refined as in the best later books, nor is the scale of detail as small.&lt;ref&gt;Calkins, 33–63 gives a full account with many illustrations; Nordenfalk, 34–47.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Meister des Book of Lindisfarne 002.jpg|thumb|right|Carpet page from the Lindisfarne Gospels]]
'''[[Lindisfarne Gospels]]'''
Produced in Lindisfarne by [[Eadfrith]], [[Bishop of Lindisfarne]], between about 690 and his death in 721 (perhaps towards the end of this period), this is a Gospel Book in the style of the Book of Durrow, but more elaborate and complex.  All the letters on the pages beginning the Gospels are highly decorated in a single composition, and many two-page openings are designed as a unit, with carpet pages facing an ''incipit'' ("Here begins..") initial page at the start of each Gospel.  Eadfrith was almost certainly the scribe as well as the artist.  There are four [[Evangelist portrait]]s, clearly derived from the classical tradition but treated without any sense of depth; the borders around them are far plainer than the decoration of the text pages, and there is clearly a sense of two styles which Eadfrith does not attempt to integrate wholly.  The carpet-pages are enormously complex, and superbly executed.&lt;ref&gt;Calkins, 63–78; Nordenfalk, 60–75&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Lichfield Gospels]]'''
Likely made in Lichfield around 730, this deluxe gospel-book contains eight major decorated pages, including a stunning cross-carpet page and portraits of the evangelists Mark and Luke. The gospels of Matthew and Mark and the beginning of Luke survives. From its time in Wales, pages include marginalia representing some of the earliest examples of Old Welsh writing. The manuscript has been at [[Lichfield Cathedral]] since the late 10th century, except for a brief period during the English Civil War. 

'''[[St Petersburg Bede]]'''.
Attributed to [[Monkwearmouth-Jarrow Abbey]] in Northumbria between about 730–746, this contains larger opening letters in which metalwork styles of decoration can clearly be seen. There are thin bands of interlace within the members of letters. It also contains the earliest [[historiated initial]], a bust probably of [[Pope Gregory I]], which like some other elements of the decoration, clearly derives from a Mediterranean model.  Colour is used, although in a relatively restrained way.&lt;ref&gt;Schapiro, 199–224; Wilson, 63&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Book of Kells]]'''
Usually dated to around 800, although sometimes up to a century earlier, the place of origin is disputed between Iona and [[Kells, County Meath|Kells]], or other locations.&lt;ref&gt;Dodwell, 84&lt;/ref&gt; It is also often thought to have been begun in Iona and then continued in Ireland, after disruption from [[Viking]] raids; the book survives nearly intact but the decoration is not finished, with some parts in outline only.  It is far more comprehensively decorated than any previous manuscript in any tradition, with every page (except two) having many small decorated letters.  Although there is only one carpet page, the ''incipit'' initials are so densely decorated, with only a few letters on the page, that they rather take over this function.  Human figures are more numerous than before, though treated in a thoroughly stylised fashion, and closely surrounded, even hemmed in, by decoration as crowded as on the initial pages.  A few scenes such as the ''Temptation'' and ''Arrest of Christ'' are included, as well as a Madonna and Child, surrounded by angels (the earliest Madonna in a Western book).  More miniatures may have been planned or executed and lost.  Colours are very bright and the decoration has tremendous energy, with spiral forms predominating.  Gold and silver are not used.&lt;ref&gt;Calkins, 78–92; Nordenfalk, 108–125&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other books===
[[File:BookMullingFol193StJohnPortrait.jpg|thumb|left|St John from the Book of Mulling]]
A distinctive Insular type of book is the '''pocket gospel book''', inevitably much less decorated, but in several cases with Evangelist portraits and other decoration.  Examples include the [[Book of Mulling]], [[Book of Deer]], [[Book of Dimma]], and the smallest of all, the [[Stonyhurst Gospel]] (now [[British Library]]), a 7th-century Anglo-Saxon text of the Gospel of John, which belonged to [[St Cuthbert]] and was buried with him.  Its beautifully tooled goatskin cover is the oldest Western bookbinding to survive, and a virtually unique example of insular leatherwork, in an excellent state of preservation.&lt;ref&gt;Bloxham &amp; Rose, and [http://faculty.luther.edu/~martinka/art43/daily/2nd/ston.jpg images] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051125092823/http://faculty.luther.edu/~martinka/art43/daily/2nd/ston.jpg |date=25 November 2005 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Both Anglo-Saxon and Irish manuscripts have a distinctive rougher finish to their vellum, compared to the smooth-polished surface of contemporary continental and all late-medieval vellum.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, 32&lt;/ref&gt; It appears that, in contrast to later periods, the scribes copying the text were often also the artists of the illuminations, and might include the most senior figures of their monastery.&lt;ref&gt;Alexander, 9 and 72. The tradition that St [[Cuthbert]] copied the Stonyhurst Gospel himself may be correct, though that attributing the Book of Kells to St [[Columba]] himself seems impossible.  For other high-ranking Anglo-Saxon monastic artists see [[Eadfrith of Lindisfarne]], [[Spearhafoc]] and [[Dunstan]], all bishops.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Movement to Anglo-Saxon art===
{{main|Anglo-Saxon art}}
In England the pull of a Continental style operated from very early on; the [[Gregorian mission]] from Rome had brought the [[St Augustine Gospels]] and other manuscripts now lost with them, and other books were imported from the continent early on.  The 8th-century [[Bede, Ecclesiastical History (British Library, MS Cotton Tiberius C. II)|Cotton Bede]] shows mixed elements in the decoration, as does the [[Stockholm Codex Aureus]] of similar period, probably written in [[Canterbury]].&lt;ref&gt;Nordenfalk, 96–107&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Vespasian Psalter]] it is clear which element is coming to dominate.  All these and other members of the "Tiberius" group of manuscripts were written south of the river [[Humber]],&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, 91–94&lt;/ref&gt; but the [[Codex Amiatinus]], of before 716 from Jarrow, is written in a fine [[uncial]] script, and its only illustration is conceived in an Italianate style, with no insular decoration; it has been suggested this was only because the volume was made for presentation to the Pope.&lt;ref&gt;Alexander, 72–73&lt;/ref&gt; The dating is partly known from the grant of additional land secured to raise the generations of cattle, amounting to 2,000 head in all, which were necessary to make the [[vellum]] for three complete but unillustrated Bibles, which shows the resources necessary to make the large books of the period.

Many Anglo-Saxon manuscripts written in the south, and later the north, of England show strong Insular influences until the 10th century or beyond, but the pre-dominant stylistic impulse comes from the continent of Europe; carpet-pages are not found, but many large figurative miniatures are. Panels of interlace and other Insular motifs continue to be used as one element in borders and frames ultimately classical in derivation.  Many continental manuscripts, especially in areas influenced by the Celtic missions, also show such features well into the early Romanesque period.  "Franco-Saxon" is a term for a school of late Carolingian illumination in north-eastern France that used insular-style decoration, including super-large initials, sometimes in combination with figurative images typical of contemporary French styles. The "most tenacious of all the Carolingian styles", it continued until as late as the 11th century.&lt;ref&gt;Dodwell (1998), 74(quote)–75, and see index.; Pächt, 72–73&lt;/ref&gt;

===Legacy of Insular art===
[[File:Meister der Franko-Sächsischen Gruppe 001.jpg|thumb|left|9th-century [[Carolingian art|Carolingian]] Franco-Saxon ''Incipit'' initial combines Insular decoration with classicising [[Evangelist portrait]]s.]]

The true legacy of insular art lies not so much in the specific stylistic features discussed above, but in its fundamental departure from the classical approach to decoration, whether of books or other works of art.  The barely controllable energy of Insular decoration, spiralling across formal partitions, becomes a feature of later medieval art, especially Gothic art, in areas where specific Insular motifs are hardly used, such as architecture. The mixing of the figurative with the ornamental also remained characteristic of all later medieval illumination; indeed for the complexity and density of the mixture, Insular manuscripts are only rivalled by some 15th-century works of late Flemish illumination. It is also noticeable that these characteristics are always rather more pronounced in the north of Europe than the south; Italian art, even in the Gothic period, always retains a certain classical clarity in form.&lt;ref&gt;Henderson, 63–71; A major theme of Pächt, see in particular chapter II and pp. 173–177&lt;/ref&gt;

Unmistakable Insular influence can be seen in [[Carolingian art|Carolingian]] manuscripts, even though these were also trying to copy the Imperial styles of Rome and Byzantium. Greatly enlarged initials, sometimes inhabited, were retained, as well as far more abstract decoration than found in classical models. These features continue in [[Ottonian]] and contemporary French illumination and metalwork, before the Romanesque period further removed classical restraints, especially in manuscripts, and the capitals of columns.&lt;ref&gt;Pächt, 72–73, and Henderson 63–71&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Muiredach s Cross.jpg|thumb|right|Muiredach's High Cross, Monasterboice]]

==Sculpture==
{{main|High cross}}
Large stone [[high cross]]es, usually erected outside monasteries or churches, first appear in the 8th century in Ireland,&lt;ref&gt;[[Grove Art Online]] S4&lt;/ref&gt; perhaps at [[Carndonagh]], [[Donegal]], a monastic site with [[Iona|Ionian]] foundations,&lt;ref&gt;Michael Herity, ''Studies in the layout, buildings and art in stone of early Irish monasteries'', Pindar Press, 1995&lt;/ref&gt; apparently later than the earliest [[Anglo-Saxon cross]]es, which may be 7th-century.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, 54–56, 113–129&lt;/ref&gt; Later insular carvings found throughout Britain and Ireland were almost entirely geometrical, as was the decoration on the earliest crosses.  By the 9th century figures are carved, and the largest crosses have very many figures in scenes on all surfaces, often from the [[Old Testament]] on the east side, and the New on the west, with a [[Crucifixion]] at the centre of the cross.  The 10th-century [[Muiredach's High Cross]] at [[Monasterboice]] is usually regarded as the peak of the Irish crosses.  In later examples the figures become fewer and larger, and their style begins to merge with the Romanesque, as at the Dysert Cross in Ireland.&lt;ref&gt;Grove&lt;/ref&gt;

The 8th-century [[Northumbria]]n [[Ruthwell Cross]] (now in [[Scotland]]), unfortunately damaged by [[Presbyterian]] [[iconoclasm]], is the most impressive remaining [[Anglo-Saxon art|Anglo-Saxon]] cross, though as with most Anglo-Saxon crosses the original cross head is missing.  Many Anglo-Saxon crosses were much smaller and more slender than the Irish ones, and therefore only had room for carved foliage, but the [[Bewcastle Cross]], [[Easby Cross]] and [[Sandbach Crosses]] are other survivals with considerable areas of figurative [[relief]]s, with larger-scale figures than any early Irish examples.  Even early Anglo-Saxon examples mix vine-scroll decoration of Continental origin with interlace panels, and in later ones the former type becomes the norm, just as in manuscripts.  There is literary evidence for considerable numbers of carved stone crosses across the whole of England, and also straight shafts, often as grave-markers, but most survivals are in the northernmost counties.  There are remains of other works of [[monumental sculpture]] in Anglo-Saxon art, even from the earlier periods, but nothing comparable from Ireland.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson deals extensively with the sculptural remains, 74–84 for the 8th century, 105–108, 141–152, 195–210 for later periods.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pictish standing stones==
{{main|Pictish stones}}
[[File:HiltonofCadboll01.JPG|thumb|upright|A replica of the [[Hilton of Cadboll Stone]], carved in the Pictish [[Easter Ross]] style 800–900 AD]]

The stone monuments erected by the [[Picts]] of [[Scotland]] north of the Clyde-Forth line between the 6th–8th centuries are particularly striking in design and construction, carved in the typical [[Easter Ross]] style related to that of insular art, though with much less classical influence. In particular the forms of animals are often closely comparable to those found in Insular manuscripts, where they typically represent the Evangelist's symbols, which may indicate a Pictish origin for these forms, or another common source.&lt;ref&gt;Laing, 54–55, Henderson, 59&lt;/ref&gt; The carvings come from both pagan and early Christian periods, and the Pictish symbols, which are still poorly understood, do not seem to have been repugnant to Christians.  The purpose and meaning of the stones are only partially understood, although some think that they served as personal memorials, the symbols indicating membership of [[clan]]s, lineages, or kindreds and depict ancient ceremonies and rituals&lt;ref&gt;Laing, 53–56. See also [http://www.megalithic.co.uk/article.php?sid=17730 C. Michael Hogan, ''Eassie Stone'', The Megalithic Portal, editor: Andy Burnham, 2007] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304085342/http://www.megalithic.co.uk/article.php?sid=17730 |date=4 March 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples include the [[Eassie Stone]] and the [[Hilton of Cadboll Stone]]. It is possible that they had subsidiary uses, such as marking tribal or lineage territories.  It has also been suggested that the [[symbol]]s could have been some kind of [[pictograph]]ic system of writing.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

There are also a few examples of similar decoration on Pictish silver jewellery, notably the Norrie's Law Hoard, of the 7th century or perhaps earlier, much of which was melted down on discovery,&lt;ref&gt;Youngs, 26–27&lt;/ref&gt; and the 8th-century [[St Ninian's Isle]] Hoard, with many brooches and bowls.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, 117–118; Youngs, 108–112, see also [http://photos.shetland-museum.org.uk/index.php?a=subjects&amp;s=gallery&amp;key=SYToyOntpOjA7aTozMTg7aToxO3M6MTY6IlN0IE5pbmlhbidzIElzbGUiO30= Shetland museum images] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110727053200/http://photos.shetland-museum.org.uk/index.php?a=subjects&amp;s=gallery&amp;key=SYToyOntpOjA7aTozMTg7aToxO3M6MTY6IlN0IE5pbmlhbidzIElzbGUiO30%3D |date=27 July 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The surviving items from both are now held by [[National Museums Scotland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nms.scran.ac.uk/s/pictish+silver|title=Search Results|first=Ian Brooks; Sven Edge; Xabier Garcia; Jamie Wheeler; Andy|last=Main|date=|website=nms.scran.ac.uk|accessdate=9 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6075">A '''line producer''' is a type of [[film producer]] who is the key manager during daily operations of a [[feature film]], [[Television advertisement|advertisement film]], [[television film]], or an [[episode]] of a [[TV program]]. A line producer usually works on one film at a time.&lt;ref name="Film Connection Film Institute"&gt;{{cite web |title=The Importance of a Line Producer|url=http://www.filmconnection.com/reference-library/film-entrepreneurs/importance-of-a-line-producer|accessdate = March 10, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are responsible for [[human resources]] and handling any problems that come up during production.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A producer who is responsible for managing every person and issue during the making of a film. Line producers only work on one film at a time|url=https://www.imdb.com/glossary/L|accessdate = March 10, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Responsibilities==
According to [[Producers Guild of America]] (PGA) guidelines, the Line Producer is the individual who reports directly to the individual(s) receiving "Produced By" credit on the theatrical motion picture and is the single individual who has the primary responsibility for the logistics of the production, from pre-production through completion of production; all Department Heads report to the Line Producer.&lt;ref name="Discovery"&gt;{{cite web|title=Producer's Code of Credits|url=http://www.producersguild.org/?coc_tmp_2|publisher=Producers Guild of America|accessdate=2 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The line producer functions like a [[chief operations officer]] in running the production company. During pre-production, responsibilities include supervising the assembly of the shooting company, recruitment of key personnel and services, and production organization for how to shoot the script and transform it into a movie.  The line producer plans start dates for everyone and everything, and monitors the budget in the lead up to picture. Film production generally follows a rigorous schedule. The line producer facilitates casting, [[location scouting]], set building and decorating, offices and stages, wardrobe, props, stunts, physical and visual effects, camera, lighting, rigging, transportation, cast, crew and union relations, travel, cast and crew accommodation, contracting of legal permissions and agreements, safety and risk management, prep and shooting schedule. In short, the line producer oversees the joint planning, negotiations, implementation and accounting for production.

In the studio system, the line producer reports to the studio and typically liaises with key executives of production divisions inside the studio such as physical production, legal, labor relations, insurance, and finance. The line producer supports the [[Director (film)|director]]'s vision and direct influence on the creative expression or narrative of the film,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web 
|title=A line producer is basically there to make the director's vision achievable.|url=http://www.creativeskillset.org/film/stories/development/article_3400_1.asp|accessdate = March 10, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though it could be argued that, through a line producer's ability to influence aspects of the film, like allocation of resources to certain departments, they can change important aspects of the film that have creative consequences, e.g., production value. For example, they can affect the project's look by influencing the choice of [[filming location]]s.&lt;ref name="Discovery"/&gt; While the director is in charge of all purely artistic decisions, the line producer helps to substantiate the director's creative ideas by taking care of [[logistics]] and related issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Runs the more practical aspects of the production such as logistics and personnel, as opposed to the creative content|url=http://www.mediacollege.com/employment/television/producer.html|accessdate = March 10, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; From [[pre-production]] through [[principal photography]], the line producer oversees the [[production budget]] and physical needs of the shoot.  By the first day of production, several versions of the budget have usually been drafted. A finalized or "locked" budget is the basis for the production to move forward. A key objective of a line producer is to respect this "locked" budget and deliver in time.

While in production, the line producer oversees the execution of many decisions that must be made to deliver each day's shoot.  The administrative aspects, especially those that have any financial impact, are all crucial areas of the line producer's work.  These areas include but are not limited to negotiating compensation (usually during pre-production) of crew members (both for union and non-union productions) and resolving daily production issues (in conjunction with the [[assistant director|first assistant director]] and possibly the [[unit production manager]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=A line producer is the person who is in charge of hiring all of the below-the-line production crew such as camera crews, lighting crews and catering staffs.|url=http://filmtvcareers.about.com/od/basics/p/CP_Line_Prod.htm|accessdate = March 10, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Moreover, they provide demanded equipment. If required, they handle unanticipated scheduling changes and serve "as a liaison between the crew and the producer."&lt;ref name="Discovery"/&gt;

==Becoming a line producer==
Line producers usually come from the ranks of assistant directors and unit production managers, giving them a strong background in the logistics of [[filmmaking]] and [[time management]]. It is common for them to continue to perform in one of those roles on projects they line produce. They do not necessarily attend a [[film school]].&lt;ref name="Film Connection Film Institute"/&gt;

The [[dimension stone|dimension-stone]] industry classifies stone based on appearance and hardness as either "granite", "marble" or "slate".

The granite of the dimension-stone industry along with truly granitic rock also includes gneiss, gabbro, anorthosite and even some sedimentary rocks.

Natural stone is used as architectural stone (construction, flooring, cladding, counter tops, curbing, etc.) and as raw block and monument stone for the funerary trade. Natural stone is also used in custom stone engraving. The engraved stone can be either decorative or functional. Natural memorial stones are used as [[natural burial]] markers.

'''Louis Monziès''' (28 May 1849 &amp;ndash; 13 March 1930) was a French painter and etcher. He was the curator of the three Museums of [[Le Mans]] for 10 years until his death.

[[Image:Lecture-Diderot-Louis-Monzies.jpg|thumb|''Lecture chez Diderot'', etching after Meissonier.]]
[[Image:Louis-Monzies-Villeneuve.jpg|thumb|right|''Villeneuve Lez Avignon'', watercolor.]]

== Career ==
Louis Monziès began to learn painting and etching in Paris in 1871 from the painters [[Jean-Louis-Ernest Meissonier|Jean-Louis Ernest Meissonier]] and [[Isidore Pils]], and from the etcher [[Léon Gaucherel]]. He got second-class and third-class medals in 1876, 1880 and 1881 at the annual [[Salon (Paris)|Salon]] in [[Paris]].

He married Eugénie Alphonsine Courtignon in 1882 at [[Cherbourg]] and three children were born : Jean in 1889, Pierre in 1891 and Jacques in 1895. He lived then in [[Paris]] but he owned also a small house in [[Normandy]] near [[Gréville-Hague]].

Louis Monziès carried out etchings for illustrated books and for Art publications, among them, those after [[Jean-Louis-Ernest Meissonier|Meissonier]] and [[Henri Pille]]. He became a member of the [[Société des artistes français]] in 1884 and also a member of the [[Société des peintres-graveurs français|Société des Peintres-Graveurs français]] in 1891. He was quite popular in Parisian art [[Salon (gathering)|salons]] with the [[Pierre Edmond Alexandre Hédouin|Hédouins]] and in the literary gathering of the editor [[Alphonse Lemerre|Lemerre]] who published famous living writers and poets with Louis' etchings.

Louis Monziès visited London and was named to the [[Royal Society of Painter-Printmakers|Royal Society of Painters-Etchers]] in 1894 when he received orders for illustrations for English books and publications. His etchings are included in major collections such as [[British Library|The British Library]] or the [[Museum of Fine Arts, Boston|Museum of Fine Arts Boston]].

But with photo-etching and other new publication processes, etchers were less and less able to make a good living from their skills. Louis Monziès move to [[Le Mans]] and became a painting teacher and a painting restoration specialist. He began to paint landscapes and urban environments in [[Normandy]] and in other towns like [[Venise, Doubs|Venise]] or [[Avignon]]. He sold a lot of watercolors and oil paintings before the First World War. A few of these paintings where sent to the USA by American officers housed by the painter at the end of the war.

He became the curator of the Museums of [[Le Mans]] in March 1920 and stayed so until his death in 1930.

The '''Mecklenburg State Theatre''' ({{lang-de|Mecklenburgisches Staatstheater Schwerin}}) is the principal theatre of [[Schwerin]] in Germany. Its main theatre (or ''Grosses Haus'') seats 650 people and is used for the performance of plays, opera, musical theatre and ballet. Designed by Georg Daniel, it was built between 1883 and 1886 after the previous theatre had been destroyed by fire in 1882. The theatre was inaugurated on 3 October 1886 with a performance of Gluck's ''[[Iphigénie en Aulide]]'' with [[Marie Wittich]] in the title role. The complex also includes the State Museum in Schwerin (''[[Staatliche Museum Schwerin]]'') and a 240-seat concert hall, now used for performances of chamber works. All theatres were closed for the Autumn season of 1944, with the staff drafted wherever possible. By German WW2 standards wartime casualties and destruction by bombing in Schwerin were small, in spite of nightly RAF raids and the droning of massive bomber pulks as silver specks on the sky during the day on their way to Berlin.  Americans were the first to enter the town in the spring of 1945, handing it over to the British until the Russians arrived. These ordered the immediate reopening of the theatre, taking great interest in light operas and operettas as an art they very much appreciated, but until then out of their reach in most parts of Stalin's Soviet Union. Not familiar with Central European culture, one saw their well-fed ladies wearing night gowns during the invariably full houses as a substitute for an evening dress.  In the immediate years to follow, there was a gradual exodus of key staff to the West, where few found equivalent employment.  The ensuing vacancies provided new chances for many musicians, who were prepared to stay in East Germany to gain important positions there in their later career.

{{Medieval and Renaissance literature}}
{{History of literature by era}}
'''Medieval literature''' is a broad subject, encompassing essentially all written works available in [[Europe]] and beyond during the [[Middle Ages]] (that is, the one thousand years from the [[fall of the Western Roman Empire]] ca. AD 500 to the beginning of the Florentine [[Renaissance]] in the late 15th century).  The literature of this time was composed of religious writings as well as [[secular]] works. Just as in modern literature, it is a complex and rich field of study, from the utterly sacred to the exuberantly profane, touching all points in-between.  Works of literature are often grouped by place of origin, language, and genre.

==Languages==
Since [[Latin]] was the language of the [[Roman Catholic Church]], which dominated [[Western Europe|Western]] and [[Central Europe]], and since the Church was virtually the only source of education, Latin was a common language for medieval writings, even in some parts of Europe that were never Romanized. However, in [[Eastern Europe]], the influence of the [[Eastern Roman Empire]] and the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] made [[Greek language|Greek]] and [[Old Church Slavonic]] the dominant written languages.

The common people continued to use their respective [[vernacular]]s. A few examples, such as the [[Old English language|Old English]] ''[[Beowulf]]'', the [[Middle High German]] ''[[Nibelungenlied]]'', the [[Medieval Greek]] ''[[Digenis Acritas]]'', the [[Old East Slavic]] ''[[The Tale of Igor's Campaign|Tale of Igor's Campaign]]'', and the [[Old French]] ''[[Chanson de Roland]]'', are well known to this day. Although the extant versions of these [[epic poetry|epics]] are generally considered the works of individual (but [[Anonymity|anonymous]]) poets, there is no doubt      that they are based on their peoples' older oral traditions. [[Celt]]ic traditions have survived in the [[Breton lai|lais]] of [[Marie de France]], the ''[[Mabinogion]]'' and the [[King Arthur#The Arthurian romance|Arthurian cycles]]. Another host of vernacular literature has survived in the [[Old Norse literature]] and more specifically in the [[Saga]] literature of [[Iceland]].

==Anonymity==
A notable amount of medieval literature is [[Anonymity|anonymous]]. This is not only due to the lack of documents from a period, but also due to an interpretation of the [[author]]'s role that differs considerably from the [[romanticism|romantic]] interpretation of the term in use today. Medieval authors often deeply respected the [[classical antiquity|classical]] writers and the [[Church Fathers]] and tended to re-tell and embellish stories they had heard or read rather than invent new stories. And even when they did, they often claimed to be handing down something from an [[auctor]] instead. From this point of view, the names of the individual authors seemed much less important, and therefore many important works were never attributed to any specific person.

==Types of writing==

===Religious===
Theological works were the dominant form of literature typically found in libraries during the Middle Ages. [[Catholic]] clerics were the intellectual center of society in the Middle Ages, and it is their literature that was produced in the greatest quantity.

Countless [[hymn]]s survive from this time period (both [[liturgy|liturgical]] and paraliturgical).  The liturgy itself was not in fixed form, and numerous competing missals set out individual conceptions of the order of the [[Mass (Liturgy)|mass]].  Religious scholars such as [[Anselm of Canterbury]], [[Thomas Aquinas]], and [[Pierre Abélard]] wrote lengthy [[theology|theological]] and [[philosophy|philosophical]] treatises, often attempting to reconcile the teachings of the Greek and Roman pagan authors with the doctrines of the Church.  [[Hagiography|Hagiographies]], or "lives of the saints", were also frequently written, as an encouragement to the devout and a warning to others.

The ''[[Golden Legend]]'' of [[Jacobus de Voragine]] reached such popularity that, in its time, it was reportedly read more often than the [[Bible]].  [[Francis of Assisi]] was a prolific poet, and his [[Franciscan]] followers frequently wrote poetry themselves as an expression of their piety. ''[[Dies Irae]]'' and ''[[Stabat Mater]]'' are two of the most powerful Latin poems on religious subjects. [[Goliardic poetry]] (four-line stanzas of satiric verse) was an art form used by some clerics to express dissent.  The only widespread religious writing that was not produced by clerics were the [[mystery play]]s: growing out of simple [[tableau vivant|tableaux]] re-enactments of a single Biblical scene, each mystery play became its village's expression of the key events in the [[Bible]].  The text of these plays was often controlled by local [[guild]]s, and mystery plays would be performed regularly on set feast-days, often lasting all day long and into the night.

During the Middle Ages, the [[Jew]]ish population of Europe also produced a number of outstanding writers. [[Maimonides]], born in [[Cordoba, Spain]], and [[Rashi]], born in [[Troyes]], [[France]], are two of the best-known and most influential of these Jewish authors.

===Secular===
[[File:Beowulf.firstpage.jpeg|thumb|The first page of ''Beowulf'']]

[[Secular]] literature in this period was not produced in equal quantity as religious literature. The earliest tales are based on oral traditions: the British ''[[Y Goddoddin]]'' and ''[[Preiddeu Annwfn]]'', along with the Germanic [[Beowulf]] and ''[[Nibelungenlied]]''. They relate to myths or certain 6th-century events, but the surviving manuscripts date from centuries later—''Y Goddoddin'' from the late 13th century, ''Preiddu Annwfn'' from the early 14th century, ''Beowulf'' from c. 1000, and the ''Nibelungenlied'' from the 13th century. The makers and performers were ''[[bard]]s'' (British/Welsh) and ''[[scop]]s'' (Germanic), elite professionals attached to royal or noble courts to praise the heroes of legendary history.

Prose tales first emerged in Britain: the intricate [[Four Branches of the Mabinogi|''Mabinogi'' quartet]] about princely families, notably anti-war in theme, and the romantic adventure ''[[Culhwch and Olwen]]'', famous for the earliest mention of [[King Arthur]]. (The ''Mabinogi'' is not the same as the ''[[Mabinogion]]'', a collection of disconnected prose tales, which does, however, include both the ''Mabinogi'' and ''Culhwch and Olwen''.) These works were compiled from earlier oral tradition c. 1100.

At about the same time a new poetry of "[[courtly love]]" became fashionable in Europe. Traveling singers—[[troubadour]]s and [[trouvère]]s—made a living from their love songs in [[French language|French]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[Galician-Portuguese]], [[Catalan language|Catalan]], [[Occitan language|Provençal]], and [[Greek language|Greek]]. Germanic culture had its  [[Minnesinger|Minnesänger]] tradition. The songs of courtly love often express unrequited longing for an ideal woman, but there are also [[aubade]]s (dawn farewells by lovers) and humorous ditties.

Following the earliest epic poems, prose tales, and romances, more long poems were crafted—the ''[[Chanson de geste|chansons de geste]]'' of the late 11th and early 12th centuries. These extolled conquests, as in ''[[The Song of Roland]]'' (part of the [[Matter of France]]) and ''[[Digenis Acritas]]'' (one of the [[Acritic songs]]). The rather different [[chivalric romance]] tradition concerns adventures about marvels, love, and chivalry. They tell of the [[Matter of Britain]] and the [[Matter of Rome]].

[[Political poetry]] threads throughout the period from the very early ''[[Armes Prydein]]'' (10th-century Britain) to the [[goliard]] rebels of 12th and 13th centuries, who were church trained clerics unable or unwilling to be employed in the church.

Travel literature was highly popular in the Middle Ages, as fantastic accounts of far-off lands (frequently embellished or entirely false) entertained a society that supported sea voyages and trading along coasts and rivers, as well as [[pilgrimage]]s to such destinations as [[Jerusalem]]; [[Canterbury]] and [[Glastonbury]] in England; [[St. David's]] in Wales; and [[Santiago de Compostela]] in Spain. [[Geoffrey Chaucer]]'s ''[[Canterbury Tales]]'' became popular at the end of the 14th century.

The most prominent authors of [[Jewish]] secular poetry in the Middle Ages were [[Solomon ibn Gabirol]] and [[Yehuda Halevi]], both of whom were also renowned religious poets.

===Women's literature===
While it is true that women in the medieval period were never accorded full equality with men, some women were able to use their skill with the written word to gain renown.  Religious writing was the easiest avenue&amp;mdash;women who would later be canonized as [[saint]]s frequently published their reflections, revelations, and prayers.  Much of what is known about [[women in the Middle Ages]] is known from the works of [[nun]]s such as [[Clare of Assisi]], [[Bridget of Sweden]], and [[Catherine of Siena]].

Frequently, however, the religious perspectives of women were held to be unorthodox by those in power, and the mystical visions of such authors as [[Julian of Norwich]], [[Mechthild of Magdeburg]], and [[Hildegard of Bingen]] provide insight into a part of the medieval experience less comfortable for the institutions that ruled Europe at the time.  Women wrote influential texts in the secular realm as well&amp;mdash;reflections on courtly love and society by [[Marie de France]] and [[Christine de Pizan]] continue to be studied for their glimpses of medieval society.

For modern historical reflection, D.H. Green's (2007) historical work entitled, ''Women Readers of the Middle Ages'' explores literacy and literature in terms of women in medieval society.&lt;ref&gt;Green, D.H. "Women Readers of the Middle Ages". Cambridge University Press, England. {{ISBN|978-0-52187-9422}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book has been reviewed as "a radical reassessment of women's contribution to medieval literary culture." &lt;ref&gt;McDonald, Nicola. [http://muse.jhu.edu/login?auth=0&amp;type=summary&amp;url=/journals/studies_in_the_age_of_chaucer/v031/31.mcdonald.html " Women Readers in the Middle Ages (review)"]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Allegory===
{{main|Allegory in the Middle Ages}}

While medieval literature makes use of many [[literary device]]s, [[allegory]] is so prominent in this period as to deserve special mention.  Much of medieval literature relied on allegory to convey the morals the author had in mind while writing—representations of abstract qualities, events, and institutions are thick in much of the literature of this time. Probably the earliest and most influential allegory is the ''[[Psychomachia]]'' (''Battle of Souls'') by [[Aurelius Clemens Prudentius]]. Other important examples include the ''[[Romance of the Rose]]'', ''[[Everyman (play)|Everyman]]'', ''[[Piers Plowman]]'', ''[[Roman de Fauvel]]'', and ''[[The Divine Comedy]]''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2282">The '''Opera of the Nobility''' (or '''Nobility Opera'''&lt;ref&gt;{{GroveOnline|title=Nobility Opera|author=|access-date=June 5, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;) was an opera company set up and funded in 1733 by a group of nobles (under [[Frederick, Prince of Wales]]) opposed to [[George II of England]], in order to rival the (Second) [[Royal Academy of Music (company)|Royal Academy of Music]] company under [[Handel]] (backed by George II and [[Caroline of Ansbach|his queen]]). 

[[Nicola Porpora]] was invited to be its musical director and [[Owen Swiny]] considered as its talent scout. The company had [[Senesino]] (who had fallen out with Handel) as its lead singer and was based at a theatre at [[Lincoln's Inn Fields]] under [[John Rich (producer)|John Rich]] which had become available on Rich's opening of the [[Theatre Royal, Covent Garden]]. The company's first opera was [[Arianna in Nasso (Porpora)|Arianna in Nasso]] by [[Porpora]], a direct challenge to Handel's [[Arianna in Creta]].

The company was not a success in its initial 1733-34 season. Though [[Farinelli]] joined it late in the season and thus made it financially solvent, he was unable to prevent its eventual bankruptcy. At the end of its initial season it took over the [[Her Majesty's Theatre|King's Theatre]] from Handel.

The company went bankrupt and was dissolved in 1737 (shortly after appointing [[Giovanni Battista Pescetti]] its musical director), but not before it had poached some of Handel's best singers such as [[Francesca Cuzzoni]] and [[Antonio Montagnana]] and forced his company into bankruptcy too.  The remnants of the two companies combined at the [[Her Majesty's Theatre|King's Theatre]] for the 1737-38 season. A second Opera of the Nobility was formed in 1740 by the [[Charles Sackville, 2nd Duke of Dorset|Earl of Middlesex]], but it did not survive for long.

'''Pierre &amp; Wright''' was responsible for many landmarks in Indianapolis and greater Indiana, and a number have been listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]]. After the partnership disbanded in 1944, Pierre started his firm Pierre and Associates. Among the architects employed by this firm were Kenneth B. Curtiss, D. B. Hill, James O. Lewis, James M. Merrifield, J. Parke Randall, D. P. Schlegel, and Richard C. Zimmer. Wright started a new firm with [[Kurt Vonnegut Sr.]] of [[Vonnegut, Bohn &amp; Mueller]] called Vonnegut &amp; Wright. After [[Ralph Oscar Yeager]] of [[Miller &amp; Yeager]] joined, the firm became Vonnegut, Wright &amp; Yeager. Later the firm was known as Wright Porteous &amp; Lowe.

'''''Real Husbands of Hollywood''''' (abbreviated '''''RHOH''''') was an American [[reality television]] parody on [[Black Entertainment Television|BET]] which debuted on January 15, 2013.&lt;ref name=info&gt;{{cite web|title="Real Husbands of Hollywood" and "Second Generation Wayans" to Premiere Tuesday, January 15 on BET|url=http://www.thefutoncritic.com/news/2012/11/28/real-husbands-of-hollywood-and-second-generation-wayans-to-premiere-tuesday-january-15-on-bet-645515/20121128bet01/|publisher=thefutoncritic|accessdate=January 2, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
The series was co-created by comedian Kevin Hart, and follows the daily lives of him and other married celebrities, each playing a fictionalized version of themselves, as they venture through their [[wikt:surreal|surreal]] life in Hollywood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=BET Networks Unveils New Programming at 2012 Upfront Presentation|url=http://www.thefutoncritic.com/news/2012/04/12/bet-networks-unveils-new-programming-at-2012-upfront-presentation-999101/20120412bet01/|accessdate=January 2, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Members of the initial cast include: [[Boris Kodjoe]], [[Nelly]], [[Duane Martin]], [[J.B. Smoove]], [[Nick Cannon]], Oliver (Hart's assistant, played by James Davis), and [[Robin Thicke]], who did not return for the second season due to his music career, though Hart has stated that the door is open for Thicke to return.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Apr 7, 2013 |url=http://blackamericaweb.com/115037/video-kevin-hart-explains-why-robin-thicke-left-real-husbands/ |title=Kevin Hart Explains Why Robin Thicke Left 'Real Husbands' |publisher=Black America Web |date=2013-04-07 |accessdate=2015-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The series is intentionally filmed in a style similar to [[Bravo (U.S. TV channel)|Bravo]]'s ''[[The Real Housewives]]''. Episodes often hinge on the "real" Kevin Hart's desperately unsuccessful attempts to climb Hollywood's celebrity social ladder (which always backfire in humiliating ways), and the character's barely-hidden jealousy of his more successful celebrity friends. A sneak peek was shown as a segment during the [[2012 BET Awards]] and the official promo was released in October 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Berkshire |first=Geoff |title=BET's 'Real Husbands of Hollywood' with Nick Cannon, 'Second Generation Wayans' get January premieres |url=http://blog.zap2it.com/frominsidethebox/2012/11/bets-real-husbands-of-hollywood-with-nick-cannon-second-generation-wayans-get-january-premieres.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121130210022/http://blog.zap2it.com/frominsidethebox/2012/11/bets-real-husbands-of-hollywood-with-nick-cannon-second-generation-wayans-get-january-premieres.html |archivedate=November 30, 2012 |publisher=[[Zap2it]] |department=From Inside the Box (blog) |access-date=January 31, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Kremlin Armoury 1.JPG|thumb|right|upright|[[Silver]] [[goblet]] presented to the Tsar of [[Russia]] by [[John III Sobieski]] King of [[Poland]], 17th century, over 1m height.]]
A '''silversmith''' is a [[Master craftsman|craftsman]] who crafts objects from [[silver]]. The terms "silversmith" and "[[goldsmith]]" are not exactly [[synonyms]] as the techniques, training, history, and [[guild]]s are or were largely the same but the end product may vary greatly as may the scale of objects created. However most goldsmiths have also worked in silver although the reverse may not be the case.

Silversmithing is the art of turning silver [[sheetmetal|sheet metal]] into [[hollowware|hollow ware]] ([[Dishware|dish]]es, [[bowl (vessel)|bowls]], [[porringer]]s, [[cup]]s, [[candlestick]]s, [[vase]]s, [[ewer]]s, [[urn]]s, etc.), [[cutlery|flatware]] (silverware), and other articles of [[silver (household)|household silver]], church plate or sculpture. It may also include the making of [[jewellery|jewelry]].

==History==
[[File:John Singleton Copley - Paul Revere - WGA5216.jpg|thumb|[[Paul Revere]] with a silver teapot and some of his engraving tools.]]
In the ancient Near East the value of silver to gold being less, allowed a silversmith to produce objects and store these as stock. Ogden states that according to an edict written by Diocletian in 301 A.D., a silversmith was able to charge 75, 100, 150, 200, 250, or 300 ''denarii'' for material produce (per Roman pound). At that time, guilds of silversmiths formed to arbitrate disputes, protect its members' welfare and educate the public of the trade.&lt;ref name=" Ogden"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oCBt7B7nt5QC&amp;pg=PA58 |author=Jack Ogden |title=Ancient Jewellery | year= |publisher=University of California Press, 7 July 1992| accessdate=10 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Silversmiths in medieval Europe and England formed guilds and transmitted their tools and techniques to new generations via the [[apprentice]] tradition.  Silver working guilds often maintained consistency and upheld standards at the expense of innovation.  Beginning in the 17th century, artisans emigrated to America and experienced fewer restrictions.  As a result, silver working was one of the trades that helped to inaugurate the [[Technological and industrial history of the United States#Silverworking|shift to industrialization]] in America.

Very exquisite and distinctly designed silverware, that goes by the name of [[Swami silver|Swami Silver]], emerged from the stable of watchmaker turned silversmith [[P.Orr &amp; Sons|P Orr and Sons]] in the South Indian city of Madras (now Chennai) during the British rule in 1875.

The [[Falasha Clan]] , or Beta Israel, of Ethiopia were known for their silversmithing skills.

Silversmiths saw or cut specific shapes from sterling and fine silver sheet metal and bar stock, and then use hammers to form the metal over anvils and stakes. Silver is hammered cold (at room temperature). As the metal is hammered, bent, and worked, it 'work-hardens'. [[Annealing (metallurgy)|Annealing]] is the heat-treatment used to make the metal soft again. If metal is work-hardened, and not annealed occasionally, the metal will crack and weaken the work.

Silversmiths can use [[casting]] techniques to create knobs, handles and feet for the hollowware they are making.

After forming and casting, the various pieces may be assembled by [[solder]]ing and [[rivet]]ing.

During most of their history, silversmiths used [[charcoal]] or [[Coke (fuel)|coke]] fired [[forge]]s, and lung-powered [[Blowpipe (tool)|blow-pipe]]s for soldering and annealing. Modern silversmiths commonly use gas burning torches as heat sources. A newer method is [[laser beam welding]].

Silversmiths may also work with [[copper]] and [[brass]], especially when making practice pieces, due to those materials having similar working properties and being more affordable than silver.

== Related and overlapping trades ==
[[File:Silver band.png|thumb|upright|right|Band made of silver]]

Although [[jeweler]]s also work in silver and gold, and many of the techniques for working [[precious metal]]s overlap, the trades of jeweler and Silversmith have distinct histories.
[[Chain]]-making and [[Gemstone|gem]]-setting are common practices of jewelers that are not usually considered aspects of silversmiths.

The tradition of making ([[iron]] / plate) [[armor]] was interrupted sometime after the 17th century.{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}} Silversmithing and goldsmithing, by contrast, have an unbroken tradition going back many millennia. The techniques used to make armor today (whether for [[movie]]s or for historical recreation groups) are an amalgam of silversmith forming techniques and [[blacksmith]] iron-handling techniques.

== Canadian observations ==
In the western Canadian silversmith tradition, guilds do not exist; however, mentoring through colleagues becomes a method of professional learning within a community of craftspersons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

  |title=Trade Secrets
  |journal=Western Horseman Magazine
  |author=Kelly McRae
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the native Canadian western tradition, silversmithing is done through hand tooling and bright cut engraving of silver.  There are silversmiths who only make jewellery and there are silversmiths who only make utensils.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Home to the [[Chicago Symphony Orchestra]]; [[Chicago Symphony Chorus]]; [[Civic Orchestra of Chicago]]; and the Institute for Learning, Access, and Training; Symphony Center includes the 2,522-seat '''Orchestra Hall''', which dates from 1904; '''Buntrock Hall''', a rehearsal and performance space; '''Grainger Ballroom''', an event space overlooking Michigan Avenue and the [[Art Institute of Chicago]]; a public multi-story rotunda; '''tesori''' restaurant; and administrative offices. In June 1993, plans to significantly renovate and expand Orchestra Hall were approved and the $110 million project resulting in Symphony Center began in 1995 and was completed in 1997. 

Orchestra Hall was designated a [[National Historic Landmark]] on April 19, 1994.&lt;ref name=nhl&gt;[http://tps.cr.nps.gov/nhl/detail.cfm?ResourceId=1754&amp;ResourceType=Building Orchestra Hall] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110605215321/http://tps.cr.nps.gov/nhl/detail.cfm?ResourceId=1754&amp;ResourceType=Building |date=2011-06-05 }}, NHL Database, National Historic Landmarks Program. Retrieved 10 February 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; It has been listed on the National Register of Historic Places since 1978.

==History==
Built in 1904, Orchestra Hall was designed by renowned Chicago [[architect]] [[Daniel Burnham]]. The new hall was specifically designed as a home for the Chicago Symphony Orchestra, which had previously performed in the larger [[Auditorium Theater]]. Construction began on May 1, 1904, and the first concert was given on December 14, 1904. The building has "Theodore Thomas Orchestra Hall" inscribed in its [[Facade|façade]], after the orchestra's [[Theodore Thomas (conductor)|first music director]] who died less than a month after his conducting debut there. The names [[Johann Sebastian Bach|Bach]], [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]], [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]], [[Franz Schubert|Schubert]], and [[Richard Wagner|Wagner]] are inscribed above the ballroom [[window]]s on the façade.

From 1907 through 1996 the ninth-floor penthouse of the building served as the home of the [[Cliff Dwellers Club]], with interior architecture by [[Howard Van Doren Shaw]] and the first significant mural of [[John Warner Norton]].

Orchestra Hall was also used as a [[movie theater]] during the 1910s, to maintain income during the summer months, when the Chicago Symphony Orchestra was playing at the [[Ravinia Festival]]. Lectures and other programs were held at Orchestra Hall in with speakers including [[Harry Houdini]], [[Richard E. Byrd]], [[Amelia Earhart]], [[Bertrand Russell]] and [[Orson Welles]].

In 2008 the venue hosted the [[2008 Green National Convention]] alongside the [[Palmer House Hilton]].

In 2012 the venue hosted the [[World Summit of Nobel Peace Laureates]] alongside the [[UIC Pavilion]]. This was held in Chicago simultaneous to the [[2012 Chicago Summit]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.chicagonato.org/12th-world-summit-of-nobel-peace-laureates--day-3-calendar_event-22.php |title=12th World Summit of Nobel Peace Laureates: Day 3 |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |website=www.chicagonato.org |access-date=August 22, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Acoustical history==

[[File:Orchestra Hall at the Symphony Center in Chicago.jpg|thumb|287px|Orchestra Hall at the Symphony Center in Chicago awaiting Ricardo Muti on the opening evening of the 2017-18 season.]]

Sub-optimal acoustics within Orchestra Hall have been an ongoing concern throughout its history, and have been adjusted in major overhauls of the main hall in both the 1960s and as part of the Symphony Center transformation between 1995 and 1997.&lt;ref name=kirk&gt;[http://www.kirkegaard.com/955 Chicago Symphony Center Project Overview.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Critical reaction is that the 1995-97 acoustical revamp was largely successful, though with room for further improvement, particularly in the upper registers.  Reviews at the time noted "...[the hall] sounded altogether new, with a depth and spaciousness never before heard here. ... The low strings, especially, had a new warmth and solidity, and the whole bass and baritonal range of the orchestra provided a firmer basis and a mellower foil for the sound above it, which has always been brash and brilliant. ... Not that everything is perfect. High frequencies can still sound glassy, and the high strings have not yet benefited as much as their brethren.  [Supervising acoustician R. Lawrence Kirkegaard] had already begun to work on the problem after a private concert on Tuesday evening and continues to do so.",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Oestreich|first=James|title=Celebration in Chicago for a New Orchestra Hall|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1997/10/06/arts/music-review-celebration-in-chicago-for-reborn-orchestra-hall.html|publisher=New York Times|accessdate=22 May 2015|date=6 October 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; "The orchestra now has a mellow bass sound that simply didn't exist before. Bass drums, previously the source of loud, dry thwacks, have a new resonance and texture. Violins have a richer color.",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Delacoma|first=Wynne|title=Symphony Center upgrade was a sound investment|publisher=Chicago Sun Times|date=9 October 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; and "It's fair to say that Orchestra Hall is, overall, vastly improved.  The reverberation time, almost nonexistent before, is much lengthened. The strings, particularly in the lower ranges, are far more audible than was once the case, and all of the instruments resound with far more bloom, warmth, and brilliance. The sound is a good deal better in the other traditional trouble spot, the main floor beneath the balcony overhang, superb in the lower balcony and altogether glorious in the gallery.".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Miller|first=Sarah Bryan|title=Orchestra Hall Gets a Tune-Up|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB876349025296585500 |publisher=Wall Street Journal|accessdate=22 May 2015|date=9 October 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a review of a piano recital, not an orchestral concert, ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' music critic John von Rhein wrote "...everything registered with the impact of the old hall, only better. There was more warmth, more space, around the keyboard. Similar reports came from listeners in the gallery.".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=von Rhein|first=John|title=Fine-tuned Chopin: Pollini's mastery puts Symphony Center sonics to test|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1997-10-14/features/9710140336_1_warsaw-chopin-competition-ballades-c-sharp-minor|publisher=Chicago Tribune|accessdate=22 May 2015|date=14 October 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, the same critic also noted shortly after the renovation "As of now, the low end has been dramatically enhanced, perhaps too much so.  The lower strings and lower brass are going to have to modify their sound output to the new sensitivities of the acoustics.  In many ways, then, Orchestra Hall is a work in progress.  The coming weeks and months will require adjustments from players and audience members alike. Lawrence Kirkegaard ... said he and his associates were 'intensively involved' in minor adjustments last week and will continue to tinker with the sound sporadically throughout the season.",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=von Rhein|first=John|title=Symphony Center Uncorks Improved Sound, Lets It Breathe|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1997-10-05/news/9710050450_1_orchestra-hall-sound-sonic-picture|publisher=Chicago Tribune|accessdate=22 May 2015|date=5 October 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; and some years after the transformation, critics at the ''Chicago Tribune'' newspaper expressed dissatisfaction with the Orchestra Hall acoustics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Artner|last2=von Rhein|last3=Reich|first1=Alan|first2=John|first3=Howard|title=How can Orchestra Hall reverse a flawed redesign?|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2002-12-01/news/0212010401_1_orchestra-hall-chicago-symphony-rhein|publisher=Chicago Tribune|accessdate=22 May 2015|date=1 December 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=von Rhein|first=John|title=Henry Fogel: Leaving the CSO in uncertain times|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2003-06-29/news/0306290357_1_henry-fogel-symphony-center-music-directors/3|publisher=Chicago Tribune|accessdate=22 May 2015|date=29 June 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''"The Bookseller"''' is a [[short story]] by [[Roald Dahl]]. It was first published in the January 1987 issue of ''[[Playboy]]''. 

==Plot summary==
[[London]] bookseller William Buggage and his assistant, Miss Tottle, have been swindling the widows of prominent men by sending fake invoices for pornographic literature supposedly purchased by their recently deceased husbands. The embarrassed widows pay the bill to avoid a public scandal. Buggage is foiled when one of his intended victims points out that her late husband was actually blind.

==Controversy==
Dahl's biographer, [[Jeremy Treglown]], states that Dahl took the plot of "The Bookseller" from "Clerical Error" (also published as "Foot In It"), a 1935 short story by [[James Gould Cozzens]]. Some readers wrote to ''[[Playboy]]'' drawing attention to the apparent [[plagiarism]], but these letters were not published.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Treglown|first1=Jeremy|title=Roald Dahl: A Biography|date=1994|authorlink1=Jeremy Treglown|publisher=Farrar|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cozzens's original story had been adapted for television in a 1983 episode of ''[[Tales of the Unexpected (TV series)|Tales of the Unexpected]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tales of the Unexpected: Clerical Error (1983)|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0717432|website=Internet Movie Database|accessdate=18 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; a series with which Dahl was closely associated.

'''''The Capture of the Hessians at Trenton, December 26, 1776''''' is the title of an [[oil painting]] by the American artist [[John Trumbull]] depicting the capture of the [[Hessian soldiers]] at the [[Battle of Trenton]] on the morning of December 26, 1776 during the [[American Revolutionary War]].

The artist intended to show the compassion of General George Washington in this painting, as he wrote in the catalogue for his exhibited works at [[Yale University]] in 1835:{{quote|
The magnanimous kindness displayed by Washington, on this occasion, offers a sublime example of true heroism, and well deserves to be imitated by all military men.

==Description==
In the center of the painting, American General George Washington is focusing his attention on the needs of the mortally wounded Hessian Colonel [[Johann Gottlieb Rall]]. Rall is being helped by American Major [[William Stephens Smith]], [[aide-de-camp]] to General [[John Sullivan (general)|John Sullivan]]. Washington orders Smith to "call our best surgeons to his assistance, and let us save his life if possible."&lt;ref name=trumbull/&gt; During the battle, Rall had been shot twice and needed to be carried into his headquarters, where he died that night.{{sfnp|Fischer|2006|pages=248, 255}}  Behind Washington, on horseback, are his aides, Colonel [[Robert H.

==Critical reception==
Trumbull did not use the prelude to the capture, namely the [[George Washington's crossing of the Delaware River|crossing of the Delaware River]], as a subject. Artists did not paint that until 1819 by [[Thomas Sully]] and then notably by [[Emanuel Leutze]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Staiti|first1=Paul|title=Of Arms and Artists: The American Revolution through Painters' Eyes|date=2016|page=221|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lhgLDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT221|publisher=[[Bloomsbury Publishing]]|isbn=978-1-63286-465-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Trumbull's work drew criticism from historian and painter [[William Dunlap]] after he viewed it in the Trumbull Gallery at Yale in 1834:&lt;ref name=yale/&gt; {{quote|All that is good in this picture was painted in 1789 and shortly after.

[[File:Devils.gif|thumb| 1812 broadside, The Devil's Walk.]]
"'''The Devil's Walk: A Ballad'''" was a major poetical work published as a broadside by [[Percy Bysshe Shelley]] in 1812.&lt;ref&gt;MacCarthy, Denis Florence, 1872&lt;/ref&gt; The poem consisted of seven irregular ballad stanzas of 49 lines.&lt;ref name="multiple"&gt;Forman, Harry Buxton, 1877, p. 371&lt;/ref&gt; The poem was a satirical attack and criticism of the British government. Satan is depicted meeting with key members of the British government.&lt;ref name="multiple"/&gt; The poem was modelled on and meant as a continuation of "The Devil's Thoughts" of 1799 by [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]] and [[Robert Southey]].&lt;ref&gt;Chewning, Harris, 1955, pp. 81–96&lt;/ref&gt; The work is important in Shelley's development and evolution of writings that castigate and criticise the British government to achieve political and economic reform.&lt;ref name="multiple"/&gt;

==Background==
The poem was written in 1812 by Shelley to protest the actions of the British government and harsh economic conditions in the country at the time. The poem emerged after the food riots in Devon where Shelley lived at that time. Prices for grain were at their highest level in 1812, there were shortages of food, and prices were inflated.&lt;ref&gt;Gilmour, Ian. ''The Making of the Poets: Byron and Shelley in Their Time''. NY: Carrol and Graf, 2002, pp. 334–336.&lt;/ref&gt; Shelley attacked "a brainless King" and the "princely paunch" and "each brawny haunch" of the Prince Regent.&lt;ref name="Gilmour, Ian. pp. 334-336"&gt;Gilmour, Ian. pp. 334–336.&lt;/ref&gt; The members of both houses of Parliament and the Church were also castigated.&lt;ref name="Gilmour, Ian. pp. 334-336"/&gt; Political leaders and the wealthy were also attacked. The British war in Spain was similarly criticised.

==Plot==

The devil, Beelzebub, awoke and dressed in his Sunday clothes. He puts on boots to hide his hooves and gloves to hide his claws. He wears a three-cornered hat, a ''bras chapeau'', to hide his horns. 

He went to London where he discussed religion and scandals with a friend. He went to St. James’s Court and St. Paul’s Church. He was “an agriculturist” and took care of his farm and his live-stock.

The devil then sat next to a priest at prayestates that without the Devil, the priest would have no job.

He then observed “a brainless King” with his attendants.

He observes that political leaders thrive from war and conflict and human misery. He castigates British policy in Ireland and the British military engagement in Spain against France. He attacks Lord Castlereagh. He attacks the Prince as being fat and having a “maudlin brain”. He observes that the Devil, sometimes called Nature, supports “men of power” and privilege.

He next observed a lawyer kill a “viper” which climbed up the leg of the table. The Devil hums “a hellish song”, comparing himself to a “yeoman” who surveys his lands contemplating his profits and gains.

He noted how the wealthy plunder and impoverish the poor. He castigates Bishops and Lawyers for their greed and pomp.

He next encounters a statesman to whom he reveals himself. The hell-hounds Murder, Want, and Woe, flocked around them. He castigates the carnage in Spain.

The devil is joyful. Monarchs prosper in war and turmoil and depredation. 

Reason, however, will ultimately prevail. Those with reason, “the sons of Reason”, understand that as reason prevails, the rule of tyrants will be short-lived and they will eventually be overthrown

It presents a radically [[Nominalism|nominalist]] and [[Individualism|individualist]] critique of [[Christianity]], [[nationalism]], and traditional morality on one hand; and on the other, [[humanism]], [[utilitarianism]], [[liberalism]], and much of the then-burgeoning [[Socialism|socialist]] movement, advocating instead an amoral (although importantly not inherently immoral or antisocial) [[egoism]]. It is considered a major influence on the development of [[anarchism]], [[existentialism]], [[nihilism]], and [[postmodernism]].&lt;ref name="SEP-Stirner"&gt;{{cite SEP|url-id=max-stirner|title=Max Stirner|last=Leopold|first=David|date=2006-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Goodway, David 2006, p. 99"&gt;Goodway, David.

== Content ==
=== Part one ===
The first part of the text begins by setting out a tripartite [[dialectics|dialectical]] structure based on an individual's stages of life (Childhood, Youth and Adulthood).&lt;ref name=Leopold&gt;Leopold, David, [http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/fall2011/entries/max-stirner/ "Max Stirner"], The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Fall 2011 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=TheEgoAndItsOwn&gt;{{cite book |last=Stirner |first=Max |editor=David Leopold |date=1995 |title=The Unique And Its Property |url= |location= |publisher=Cambridge texts in the history of political thought |page= |isbn= |access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the first ''realistic'' stage, children are restricted by external material forces. Upon reaching the stage of youth, they begin to learn how to overcome these restrictions by what Stirner calls the "self-discovery of mind". However, in the ''idealistic'' stage, a youth now becomes enslaved by internal forces such as conscience, reason and other 'spooks' or 'fixed ideas' of the mind (including [[religion]], [[nationalism]] and other ideologies). The final stage, 'egoism' sees the now adult individual freed from all internal and external constraints, attaining individual autonomy.&lt;ref name=Leopold/&gt;

Throughout the book, Stirner applies this dialectial structure to human history (the Ancient and Modern worlds, and the Egoistic Future). Part one is a sustained critique of the first two periods of human history and especially of the failure of the [[Modernity|Modern world]] to escape from religious modes of thinking. Stirner's analysis is opposed to the belief that modern individuals are [[Social progress|progressively]] more free than their predecessors.&lt;ref name=Leopold/&gt; Stirner sees moderns as being oppressed by ideological forces such as [[Christianity]] and the ideologies of the modern [[nation state]].

Stirner's critique of modernity is centred on the [[Protestant Reformation]]. According to Stirner, Reformation theology extended religious domination over individuals by blurring the distinction between the sensual and the spiritual (thus allowing priests to marry for example).  The Reformation also strengthened and intensified religious belief and made it more personal, creating an internal conflict between natural desires and religious conscience. Thus the Reformation only served to further enslave Europeans under spiritual ideology.&lt;ref name=Leopold/&gt;

Stirner's critique of a progressive view of history is part of his attack on the philosophies of the [[Young Hegelians|left Hegelians]], especially that of [[Ludwig Feuerbach]]. Stirner sees Feuerbach's philosophy as merely a continuation of religious ways of thinking. Feuerbach had argued that Christianity was mistaken in taking human qualities and projecting them into a transcendent God. But according to Stirner, Feuerbach's philosophy, while rejecting a God, left the Christian qualities intact. Feuerbach had taken a set of human qualities and reified them, making them the only prescriptive view of humanity. This became just another religion for Stirner, a "change of masters" over the individual.&lt;ref name=Leopold /&gt; Stirner criticizes other left-Hegelians for setting a conception of essential human nature as a goal to be striven for outside of the individual themselves. So while liberals like [[Arnold Ruge]] found the essence of the human in citizenship, and social liberals like [[Moses Hess]] found it in labor, all of them made a similar error of ossifying an "essence" of the human and deifying it. For Stirner, 'human nature' cannot provide any prescriptions on how one ought to live. His goal is to free the individual from such notions of essential universal goals.

=== Part two ===
Part two is centered on the possibility of freedom from current ideological ways of thinking through a robust philosophical egoism. Stirner's egoism is centered on what he calls ''Eigenheit'' ('Ownness' or autonomy). This 'Ownness' is a feature of a more advanced stage of human personal and historical development. It is the groundwork for our world-view. 

Stirner's Egoism is not a descriptive [[psychological egoism]], in fact he believes that non-egoism is the most common way of thinking. Stirner also does not advocate a narrow prescriptive [[ethical egoism]] of self-interest. Stirner rejects, for example, the actions of an avaricious individual whose only pursuit is material gain. For Stirner such a pursuit enslaves the individual to a single goal and this is incompatible with his idea of autonomy.&lt;ref name=Leopold/&gt;

Stirner's conception of Ownness is then a type of self-mastery in which one's actions are unrestricted by any internal or external constraints—"I am my own only when I am master of myself, instead of being mastered by...anything else".&lt;ref name=TheEgoAndItsOwn/&gt;{{rp|153}} To attain autonomy, the individual must free himself from all forces, such as ideologies, religions, ethics, other persons and even their own desires. For Stirner, ''Eigenheit'' is the only good, and is incompatible with any moral, political and familial obligations ("the forming of a family binds a man".&lt;ref name=TheEgoAndItsOwn/&gt;{{rp|102}}) Stirner's influence in anarchist circles stems from his rejection of the legitimacy of the state. Stirner argues that "own will and the state are powers in deadly hostility, between which no 'perpetual peace' is possible".&lt;ref name=TheEgoAndItsOwn/&gt;{{rp|175}} Every form of the state is rejected as a despotism over individual self ownership. Even a unanimously democratic decision does not bind Stirner's egoist, since this would freeze his "will of yesterday", making him a slave to his past desires and decisions. Stirner rejects promise keeping on similar grounds of not allowing past actions to constrain his autonomy. He states that the egoist must embrace the "heroism of the lie".&lt;ref name=TheEgoAndItsOwn/&gt;{{rp|210}}

Along with his critique of ideologies and institutions, Stirner also provides an alternative form of social relationship, the "[[union of egoists]]" (''verein von egoisten'').&lt;ref name=TheEgoAndItsOwn/&gt;{{rp|161}} These unions are temporary groupings of self-determined individuals which do not subordinate each individual to the good of the group. The only good in these unions is the self-interest of each individual. Stirner suggests that some human relationships like [[love]] might continue in this new egoistic future. However this new kind of love is one in which the egoist does not sacrifice his autonomy and thus he loves only as long as "love makes me happy".&lt;ref name=TheEgoAndItsOwn/&gt;{{rp|256}}

Stirner does not shy away from the radical outcomes of his worldview. He explains the relationship between the egoist and his objects or other persons as one of 'ownership'. For Stirner this means that there are no restrictions, moral or otherwise, on how an egoist can relate to other things and persons. The egoist views others instrumentally, they are "nothing but - my food, even as I am fed upon and turned to use by you".&lt;ref name=TheEgoAndItsOwn/&gt;{{rp|263}} The consequences of this view is that he does not see murder, incest and infanticide as always unjustified. Stirner admits that this view affords little comfort to others but he states that his audience's concern is of no importance to him.

{{quote box|quote=Do I write out of love to men? No, I write because I want to procure for my thoughts an existence in the world; and, even if I foresaw that these thoughts would deprive you of your rest and your peace, even if I saw the bloodiest wars and the fall of many generations springing up from this seed of thought &amp;mdash; I would nevertheless scatter it. Do with it what you will and can, that is your affair and does not trouble me. You will perhaps have only trouble, combat, and death from it, very few will draw joy from it.|source=[[Max Stirner]], ''The Ego and Its Own'', p. 394|align=left|salign=right}}{{clear|left}}
He also asserted his own "doctrine" of self-interest to be neither a universal truth nor an established viewpoint, and likens his book to a [[ladder]] you throw away after climbing, a sort of self-therapy.&lt;ref&gt;The same mental image of a ladder to be thrown away after climbing is used by [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]] in section 6.54 of ''[[Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus]]''. This turn of phrase was originally coined by [[Arthur Schopenhauer]] in 1844: {{quotation|However, for the man who studies to gain ''insight'', books and studies are merely rungs of the ladder on which he climbs to the summit of knowledge. As soon as a rung has raised him up one step, he leaves it behind. On the other hand, the many who study in order to fill their memory do not use the rungs of the ladder for climbing, but take them off and load themselves with them to take away, rejoicing at the increasing weight of the burden. They remain below forever, because they bear what should have bourne them.|[[Arthur Schopenhauer]]| ''[[The World as Will and Representation]]'', Vol. II, Chapter VII}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Style and structure ==
Stirner repeatedly quotes [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe]], [[Friedrich Schiller]] and [[Bruno Bauer]] assuming that readers will be familiar with their works. He also paraphrases and makes word-plays and [[in-joke]]s on formulations found in [[Hegel]]'s works as well as in the works of his contemporaries such as [[Ludwig Andreas Feuerbach|Ludwig Feuerbach]]. This can make the book more demanding for contemporary readers.

== Reception and influence ==
Initially, ''The Unique And Its Property'' received much attention, though most reviews were negative critiques by left Hegelians such as [[Ludwig Feuerbach]] and [[Moses Hess]], as well as by Carl Schmitt.&lt;ref name="Welsh17"&gt;Welsh, John F. Max Stirner's Dialectical Egoism, A new interpretation; p. 17. Lexington Books, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Feuerbach's critique, "[[The Essence of Christianity]] in Relation to The Unique And Its Property" called the work 'ingenious' and 'intelligent' but also criticizes it as 'eccentric, one-sided and falsely defined.' &lt;ref name="Welsh17" /&gt; Stirner responded to these critiques in an 1845 essay titled "Stirner's Critics".

''The Unique And Its Property'' also had a profound impact on [[Marx]] and [[Engels]]. In 1844 Engels sent a letter to Marx praising "the noble Stirner" and suggesting that his dialectical Egoism can serve as a point of departure for communism: &lt;blockquote&gt;It is certainly true that we must first make a cause our own, egoistic cause, before we can do anything to further it. . . . [W]e are communists out of egoism also, and it is out of egoism that we wish to be human beings, not mere individuals...&lt;ref name="Welsh20"&gt;Welsh, John F. Max Stirner's Dialectical Egoism, A new interpretation; p. 20. Lexington Books, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

However, Marx and Engels would later collaborate on a lengthy criticism of Stirner's book in ''[[The German Ideology]]'' (1845, published 1932). The critique is a polemical tirade filled with ad hominem attacks and insults against Stirner (Marx calls him a "petty bourgeois individualist intellectual").&lt;ref name="Welsh2223"&gt;Welsh, John F. Max Stirner's Dialectical Egoism, A new interpretation; pp. 22–23. Lexington Books, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

Stirner also had a lasting influence in the tradition of [[Individualist Anarchism]]. American Individualist [[Benjamin R. Tucker]], editor of the Journal ''[[Liberty (1881–1908)|Liberty]]'', adopted Stirner's Egoism in 1886 while rejecting conceptions of [[natural rights]]. This led to a bitter split in American Individualist Anarchism between Egoists such as [[James L. Walker]], [[Sidney Parker (anarchist)|Sidney Parker]], [[Dora Marsden]] and [[John Beverley Robinson (anarchist)|John Beverly Robinson]] and the proponents of natural rights anarchism such as that of [[Lysander Spooner]].&lt;ref&gt;McElroy, Wendy.

IV, NO. 3&lt;/ref&gt; Other Individualist Anarchists influenced by Stirner include [[Lev Chernyi]], [[Adolf Brand]], [[Renzo Novatore]], [[John Henry Mackay]], [[Enrico Arrigoni]],  [[Miguel Giménez Igualada]], and [[Émile Armand]].

Recently, Stirner has been an influential source for [[post-left anarchy|post-left anarchist]] thinkers such as [[Jason McQuinn]], [[Bob Black]] and [[Hakim Bey]].

== Confusion of the censors ==
''He who destroyes a good Booke, kills reason it selfe'', a 1955 exhibition by University of Kansas Library noted the following regarding the book's initial publication: {{quote|Its frank espousal of anarchistic egoism led to the not unexpected announcement in the newspapers of Saxony that the book had been immediately confiscated in Leipzig. Anxious not to be outdone, where usually they were so far ahead, Prussia banned the book. Then, Berlin received more accurate news: the book had not been banned in Saxony at all. In fact, the book's farfetched overstatement was regarded at Dresden as its own best antidote. The small states of Germany fell into line, on one side or the other, often with considerable difficulty owing to the scarcity of copies to examine first.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://spencer.lib.ku.edu/exhibits/bannedbooks/germany.html|title=''He who destroyes a good Booke, kills reason it selfe'', an exhibition of books which have survived Fire, the Sword and the Censors |publisher=University of Kansas Library |year=1955 |accessdate=March 2, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

'''Tyeb Mehta''' (25 July 1925&amp;nbsp;– 2 July 2009) was an Indian painter, sculptor and film maker. He was part of the [[Bombay Progressive Artists' Group]] and the first [[post-colonial]] generation of artists in India, like John Wilkins who also broke free from the nationalist [[Bengal school]] and embraced [[Modernism]] instead, with its [[post-impressionist]] colours, [[cubist]] forms and [[wikt:brusque|brusque]], [[expressionistic]] styles.

Among his most noted later paintings were his [[triptych]] ''[[Celebration (painting)|Celebration]]'', which when sold for Rs 15&amp;nbsp;million ($317,500) at a [[Christie's]] auction in 2002, was not only the highest sum for an Indian painting at an international auction, but also triggered the subsequent great Indian art boom;{{cn|date=June 2016}} his other noted works were the 'Diagonal Series', ''Santiniketan triptych'' series, ''[[Kali (painting)|Kali]]'', ''Mahishasura'' (1996).&lt;ref&gt;[http://in.reuters.com/article/entertainmentNews/idINIndia-40764420090702 Artist Tyeb Mehta dies after long illness] [[Reuters]], 2 July 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; He stayed and worked in [[Mumbai]] for much of his life, except for three spells at London, New York, and [[Santiniketan]], each having a distinct impact upon his work. He received several awards during his career including the [[Padma Bhushan]] in 2007.&lt;ref name=nin&gt;[http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2009-07-03/india/28178801_1_tyeb-mehta-koodal-rickshaw-puller Tyeb Mehta stood for hope over hype] Nina Martyris, [[Times of India]], 3 July 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/ET-Cetera/Artist-Tyeb-Mehta-passes-away/articleshow/4730972.cms Tyeb Mehta, who weaved metaphor into images passes away] [[The Economic Times]], 3 July 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.business-standard.com/india/news/tyeb-mehta-was-indias-most-expensive-living-artist-also-its-finest/362810/ Tyeb Mehta was Indias most expensive living artist, also its finest] Kishore Singh, [[Business Standard]], 3 July 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and education==
Tyeb Mehta was born on 26 July  1925 in [[Kapadvanj]], a town of [[Kheda district]], the Indian state of [[Gujarat]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.oxfordartonline.com/view/10.1093/gao/9781884446054.001.0001/oao-9781884446054-e-7000056541|title=Mehta, Tyeb {{!}} Grove Art|language=en|doi=10.1093/gao/9781884446054.001.0001/oao-9781884446054-e-7000056541|access-date=2018-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was brought up in the [[Crawford Market]] neighbourhood of Mumbai, populated by [[Dawoodi Bohras]]. At 22 years, during the [[Partition of India|partition]] riots of 1947 in Mumbai, while staying at Lehri House, Mohammed Ali Road, he witnessed a man being stoned to death by a mob, this he not only expressed in a drawing but it was to have lasting impact on his work, leading to stark and often disturbing depiction of his subjects.&lt;ref name=nin/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Svaraj: a journey with Tyeb Mehta's "Shantiniketan triptych"''. by [[Ramchandra Gandhi]]. Vadehra Art Gallery, 2002. {{ISBN|81-87737-02-6}}. ''Page 60''&lt;/ref&gt;

For a while initially, he worked as a film editor in a cinema laboratory at Famous Studios, in [[Tardeo]], Mumbai. Later, he received his diploma from [[Sir J.J. School of Art|Sir J. J. School of Art]] in 1952, and was part of the [[Bombay Progressive Artists' Group]], which drew stylistic inspiration from Western [[Modernism]], and included greats of Indian paintings such as [[F.N. Souza]], [[S.H. Raza]] and [[M.F. Husain]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/I-dont-paint-for-money-Tyeb-Mehta/articleshow/4654123.cms 'I don't paint for money'] [[The Times of India]], 14 June 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
He left for London in 1959, where he worked and lived till 1964. Thereafter, he visited the New York City, when he was awarded a fellowship from the [[Asian Cultural Council|John D. Rockefeller 3rd Fund]] in 1968.&lt;ref name="timesofindia.indiatimes.com"&gt;[http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2002-09-20/news-interviews/27324810_1_tyeb-mehta-filmfare-critic-s-award-film-editor Tyeb Mehta: From filmmaker to painter] [[The Times of India]], 20 September 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; During the years the artist spent in London, Mehta's style was influenced by the expressionist works of Francis Bacon, but while in New York his work came to be characterised by minimalism.&lt;ref&gt;Tully, Judd.

Common themes of his works were trussed bulls, the rickshaw puller, from here he moved to the ''Diagonal series'', which he created through the 1970s, after accidentally discovering it in 1969, when in a moment of creative frustration he flung a black streak across his canvas.&lt;ref name=nin/&gt; Later in life, he added ''Falling Figures'' made in 1991, based on his experience of witnessing the violent death of a man in the street during the [[Partition of India]] riots of 1947,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Christie's First India Auction Offers Lots from The Gandhys' Collection |publisher= BLOUIN ''[[Art+Auction]]'' magazine| url = http://in.blouinartinfo.com/news/story/987054/christies-first-india-auction-offers-lots-from-the-gandhys |date=20 November 2013| accessdate = 24 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Besides adding several mythological figures into his work, highlighted by the depictions of goddess [[Kali]] and demon [[Mahishasura]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thestatesman.net/page.news.php?clid=2&amp;theme=&amp;usrsess=1&amp;id=259876 Tyeb Mehta passes away] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090709150919/http://www.thestatesman.net/page.news.php?clid=2&amp;theme=&amp;usrsess=1&amp;id=259876 |date=9 July 2009 }} Press Trust of India, [[The Statesman (India)|The Statesman]], 2 July 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2005, Mehta's painting ''Gesture'' was sold for 31 million Indian rupees to Ranjit Malkani, chairman of Kuomi Travel, at the Osian's auction.

'''Uptown Oakland''' or '''The Uptown''' is a neighborhood in  [[Downtown Oakland|Downtown]] [[Oakland, California]].  Its boundaries are ill-defined, but most definitions include the area between 27th Street to the north, [[San Pablo Avenue]] to the west, [[Oakland City Center|City Center]] to the south, and Harrison St to the east.  The neighborhood has become an important [[entertainment district]] in recent years.&lt;ref name=sfbtpost&gt;http://www.bizjournals.com/sanfrancisco/print-edition/2011/11/25/moving-ahead-in-oakland-post-occupy.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The area near 20th Street and Broadway had been Oakland's main [[shopping district]] in the mid-20th century. Several buildings from that era remain, including the [[Capwell's]] department store, which later became [[Sears]] and is currently being developed into a mixed-use retail and office building called "Uptown Station;"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.mercurynews.com/2017/12/19/downtown-oaklands-uber-building-is-bought-by-cim-group-rehab-will-continue/|title=Downtown Oakland’s Uber building is bought by CIM Group, rehab will continue|date=2017-12-19|work=The Mercury News|access-date=2018-10-10|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[I. Magnin]] department store; the [[Paramount Theater (Oakland, California)|Paramount Theater]]; and the [[Fox Oakland Theatre]]. The Payless Drug Store and Market located at Telegraph Ave. and 20th St, housed the drug store small produce markets and seafood sellers. It included a SAAG's sausage counter and even a USO branch.
This structure was demolished in the early 1960s to construct a parking structure for Capwell's Department store. The area was home to one of the original [[Kwik Way]] hamburger outlets and also at Broadway and Grand Ave the Oakland branch of Breuners furniture.

West of [[Telegraph Avenue]], the neighborhood was for many years largely made up of [[parking lot]]s and garages. The area has gone through several failed [[urban renewal]] projects and proposals, including proposals for a shopping mall, an entertainment district, high-rise housing, and a professional baseball stadium. The area now contains several attractive high-rise apartment buildings.

==Development==
During [[Jerry Brown]]'s time as Mayor (1999-2007) The Uptown District was deemed the Entertainment center of the city.  Redevelopment has taken place by large upscale apartments and restaurants, bringing some much needed money and foot traffic into the area. The centerpiece has been the city government's 10K program, an effort to bring 10,000 additional residents to the downtown area. The largest of the new apartment complexes is a five-story, three-building apartment complex called "The Uptown"&lt;ref name=uptown&gt;http://www.theuptown.net/&lt;/ref&gt; built by [[Forest City Enterprises]], including a new dog-friendly park called Fox Square.  A new surface street, '''Rashida Muhammad Street''', was named after the late community activist who died of lung cancer in 2006. [[Alice Walker]] immortalized Rashida Muhammad's (aka Dessie X. Woods) story in her collection of essays ''Living by the Word''.  The street was built with the stated goal of The Uptown project of enhancing and building a new community in the area.  This complex also features the "Remember Them" sculpture by [[Mario Chiodo]], a local artist.&lt;ref name=remember&gt;http://remember-them.org/&lt;/ref&gt; The sculpture, when it is complete, will be one of the largest bronze sculptures in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Carolyn Jones.

January 2, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;  The 25 humanitarians honored in this sculpture include [[Oskar Schindler]], [[Maya Angelou]], [[Ruby Bridges]], [[Cesar Chavez]], [[Thích Nhất Hạnh|Thich Nhat Hanh]], and [[Mother Teresa]].

Numerous bars and restaurants have opened between 16th Street and Grand Avenue. Retail continues to add to the landscape of the Uptown District.

In addition to becoming a nightlife destination for East Bay residents, the area has developed well culturally overall. The area now includes many cafes, bakeries, and galleries, as well as being a central hub for the other bars and restaurants located in the surrounding neighborhoods.

What is commonly called "First Friday" or "Art Murmur" has given way to a vibrant art scene in Oakland which mainly centers around the Uptown District.  Some of the first galleries to open in this area included 21 Grand, the defunct Mama Buzz Cafe (now the [http://telegraphoakland.com/ Telegraph Beer Garden]), and [http://rpscollective.com/ Rock Paper Scissors] (art collective and store.)   More recent notable galleries include Krowswork, [http://www.mercurytwenty.com Mercury 20 Gallery], Johansson Projects and Creative Growth.  In September 2011 Project Bandaloop performed the premier of an aerial dance piece called Bound(less) on The Great Wall of Oakland, and in May 2013 the first annual [http://www.oaklandcatvidfest.com/ Oakland Internet Cat Video Festival] took place on the Great Wall.

Two Mile Wines has produced wines in the Uptown district since 2009, pushing urban winemaking into the heart of Oakland and First Friday.  More recently, Oakland Spirits Company has started producing gins, brandies, and other spirits in the neighborhood, demonstrating that a mix of art, manufacturing, and trades can thrive amidst rapid gentrification.

Uptown is in the so-called [[Oaksterdam]] district of medical marijuana clubs which have contributed to a resurgence in retail and pedestrian activity in the area{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}.

Uptown is also the home to the Oakland Ice Center, which houses youth and adult amateur hockey leagues, figure skating lessons, and public skating sessions.
