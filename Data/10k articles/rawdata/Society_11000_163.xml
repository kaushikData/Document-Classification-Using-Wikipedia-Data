The '''7 November 1975 Bangladesh coup d'état''' was a coup d'état launched by left wing army personnel in collaboration with left-wing politicians from Jatiya Samajtantrik Dal. The coup killed Khaled Mosharraf who had removed those involved in the [[Assassination of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman]] from power. The coup also freed Ziaur Rahman from house arrest and allowed him to eventually seize power and become president.

==Background==
Bangladesh became an Independent country in 1971 through the Bangladesh Liberation war. Sheikh Mujibur Rahman of the socialist Bangladesh Awami League became the first president of Bangladesh.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=7th November 1975: Conflict between 'isms'|url=http://www.thedailystar.net/news-detail-114880|accessdate=10 January 2018|work=The Daily Star|date=20 November 2009|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, the President of Bangladesh, was killed in the [[15 August 1975 Bangladesh coup d'état|15 August 1975]] military coup.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=Rahman,_Bangabandhu_Sheikh_Mujibur|title=Rahman, Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur - Banglapedia|website=en.banglapedia.org|language=en|access-date=2018-01-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Khondaker Mostaq Ahmad replaced him as the President of Bangladesh.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Khondaker Mostaq Ahmad replaced the Bangladesh Army chief, Major General [[K M Shafiullah]], with  Major General [[Ziaur Rahman]], the deputy Army chief.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.thedailystar.net/august-15-special-coverage/when-caesar-died-and-him-all-the-tribunes-1269664|title=When Caesar died . . . and with him all the tribunes|date=2009-11-19|work=The Daily Star|access-date=2018-01-10|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pakistan welcome the removal of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman and China and Saudi Arabia established diplomatic ties with Bangladesh.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Brigadier Khaled Mosharraf, the chief of general staff, had asked Ziaur Rahman for the chain of command in Bangladesh Army to be restored, Ziaur Rahman proved unwilling or unable to do so. There was discontent in the Army and Brigadier Khaled Mosharraf and officers like Colonel [[Shafaat Jamil]] and Lieutenant Colonel [[Abu Taher Mohammad Haider|A.T.M Haider]] planned to remove Khondaker Mostaq Ahmad from power.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

Khondakar Mostaq Ahmad was himself removed from power through the military coup on [[3 November 1975 Bangladesh coup d'état|5 November 1975]].&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=Ahmad,_Khondakar_Mostaq|title=Ahmad, Khondakar Mostaq - Banglapedia|website=en.banglapedia.org|language=en|access-date=2018-01-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was removed from power by Brigadier [[Khaled Mosharraf]] and Lieutenant Colonel [[Abu Taher Mohammad Haider|A.T.M Haider]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.thedailystar.net/news/november-7-let-the-truth-be-known|title=November 7: Let the truth be known|date=2013-11-07|work=The Daily Star|access-date=2018-01-10|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Khaled Mosharraf forced Khondaker Mostaq Ahmad to resign but listed to Khondaker Mostaq Ahmad's request that the assassins of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman be given safe passage out of Bangladesh. Before the assassins left Bangladesh they had killed Awami league leaders and former Vice President [[Syed Nazrul Islam]], former Prime Minister [[Muhammad Mansur Ali]], former Minister [[Abul Hasnat Muhammad Qamaruzzaman]] and former prime minister [[Tajuddin Ahmad|Tajuddin Ahmed]] who were imprisoned in Dhaka Central Jail after the 15 August military coup. Khondaker Mostaq Ahmad was replaced by the Chief Justice of Bangladesh, Abu Sadat Mohammad Sayem, who became the next president.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

==Events==

Rumours were spread in cantonments in Bangladesh that said Brigadier Khaled Mosharraf and Lieutenant Colonel A.T.M Haider were Indian agents who would give Bangladesh over to India.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Colonel Abu Taher organised soldiers loyal to him and Major General Ziaur Rahman to replace the government. They launched the coup on 7 November 1975. Khaled Mosharraf and Lieutenant Colonel A.T.M Haider tried to resist the coup but failed, they were killed by the Army soldiers.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Colonel Abu Taher had resigned from the Army in September 1972 and joined the [[Jatiya Samajtantrik Dal-JSD|Jatiya Samajtantrik Dal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.thedailystar.net/magazine/2011/04/01/cover.htm|title=Colonel Abu Taher|last=|first=|date=|website=thedailystar.net|publisher=The Daily Star|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-01-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Soldiers in the street shouted Nara-e-Takbeer and Sepoy-Janata Zindabad.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.thedailystar.net/news-detail-256057|title=None righted the wrong|date=2012-11-03|work=The Daily Star|access-date=2018-01-10|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was suggested Colonel [[Abu Taher]] was involved in the death of Brigadier Khaled Mosharraf.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Chief of Army staff Major General [[Ziaur Rahman]] who was placed under house arrest by Khaled Mosharraf was freed.

The [[ethnonym]] "'''Adyghe'''" ({{lang-ady|Адыгэ/Adygè}}, {{lang-ru|Ады́ги}}) is used as an [[endonym]] by the [[Northwest Caucasian languages|Caucasian]]-speaking [[Circassians]] of the [[North Caucasus]] and as a [[demonym]] for the inhabitants of the [[Republic of Adygea]], a [[Federal subjects of Russia|federal subject]] of [[Russia]] located in the southwestern part of [[European Russia]], enclaved within [[Krasnodar Krai]], where it is also rendered as '''Adygeans''' ({{lang-ru|Адыгейцы}}).{{Cref2|a}} The Adygeans (of Adygea) speak the [[Adyghe language]].

==Ethnology==
 {{see also|Circassians}}
The Adyge people are one of the Circassian peoples, along with the [[Cherkess]] (of [[Karachay-Cherkessia]]) and [[Kabards]] (of [[Kabardino-Balkaria]]), from whom they are geographically separated by the Slav-inhabited [[Laba River|Laba]] region.{{sfn|Minahan|2002|p=36}} The languages of the Adygeans, Cherkess and Kabards are [[mutually intelligible]], however, there is a consensus that these are typologically distinct languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hewitt|first1=George|title=North West Caucasian|journal=Lingua|date=2005|volume=115|issue=1–2|page=17|doi=10.1016/j.lingua.2003.06.003}}&lt;/ref&gt; The standard (literary) Adyghe language is based on the dialect of the Temirgoy tribe.&lt;ref name="FortescueMithun2017"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Michael Fortescue|author2=Marianne Mithun|author3=Nicholas Evans|title=The Oxford Handbook of Polysynthesis|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=d4c0DwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA949|date=29 July 2017|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-968320-8|pages=949–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Adygeans, known as "western Circassians" per Soviet terminology from the 1930s, use a written language separated by Soviet policy from those of the [[Cherkess]] ("central Circassians") and [[Kabards]] ("eastern Circassians"), despite the possibility to have a unified one. The [[Adyghe-Cherkess Autonomous Oblast]] was established in July 1922, "Cherkess" being dropped from the name in August 1936.{{sfn|Olson|Pappas|Pappas|1994|p=152}}

The Circassian peoples are [[Circassian tribes|divided into tribes]] or clans (''tlapq''). There are ten Adyghe tribes (or subgroups),{{sfn|Olson|Pappas|Pappas|1994|p= 15}}{{sfn|Minahan|2002|p=37}} out of which four are identified{{by whom?|date=April 2018}} as speaking mutually intelligible Adyghe dialects: Abzakh, Bzhedug, Temirgoy and Shapsug.{{sfn|Olson|Pappas|Pappas|1994|p= 15}}&lt;ref name="FortescueMithun2017"/&gt;
The Shapsug were counted as a separate ethnic group in the censuses.&lt;ref name=2010census/&gt;

==Population==
 [[File:Adyghe in Adygea (2002).png|thumb|right|300px|Distribution of Adygeans in Adygea, Russia (2002 census)]]
According to the 2010 census of Russia, the number of self-declared ethnic "Adyghe" is 124,835 (0.09%). The community included 107,048 in Adygea itself (ca. 25% of the republic's population), 13,834 in Krasnodar Krai, 569 in [[Moscow]].&lt;ref name=2010census&gt;2010 census of Russia&lt;/ref&gt; The majority of the population in Adygea declare as Russians (63.6%). In 2002 it was estimated that the community numbered 131,000 in all of Russia.{{sfn|Minahan|2002|p=36}} The other closely related groups, Kabards and Cherkess, numbered 516,826 (0.38%) and 73,184 (0.05%), respectively.&lt;ref name=2010census/&gt; Those that declared as Shapsug, who speak an Adyghe dialect and are regarded an Adyghe subgroup, numbered 3,882.&lt;ref name=2010census/&gt;

There is a significant Adyghe diaspora. It was estimated in 1997 that there were 71,000 Adyghe-speakers in Turkey, 44,000 in Jordan, and 25,000 in Syria.&lt;ref name="Lyovin1997"&gt;{{cite book|author=Anatole Lyovin|title=An Introduction to the Languages of the World|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=y6Y-L4ogfhIC&amp;pg=PA57|year=1997|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-508116-9|pages=57–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{main|History of the Circassians}}
The political history of the Adyghe in Adygea since the Russian Revolution is complex. On 27 July 1922, a Circassian (Adygea) Autonomous Oblast was established in the [[Kuban-Black Sea Oblast]], which would later become [[Krasnodar Krai]]. After several name changes, the [[Adyghe Autonomous Oblast]] was established on 3 August 1928. On 5 October 1990, the Adygea ASSR was proclaimed and separated from Krasnodar Krai. On 24 March 1992, it became the [[Republic of Adygea]]. A significant population of the Adyghe community now lives in the Black Sea region of Northern Turkey where their culture is preserved in villages in the area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author= |date= |url=http://joshuaproject.net/people_groups/10161/TU |title=Adyghe in Turkey |publisher= |accessdate=2014-09-16 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/616BvJEEv?url=http://www.perepis2002.ru/content.html?id=11&amp;docid=10715289081463 |archivedate=2011-08-21 |deadurl=yes |df= }} &lt;/ref&gt;

==Annotations==
{{Cnote2 Begin|liststyle=upper-alpha}}
{{Cnote2|a|In Russian, Adygea's Circassian residents are called ''Adygejtsy'' ({{lang|ru|Адыгейцы}}, meaning 'those [of the Republic] of Adygea'), whereas the Circassians in general are called ''Adygi'' ({{lang|ru|Адыги}}, meaning 'the Adyghe'). In English terminology, on the other hand, many foreigners fail to distinguish between these Russian-specific administrative (former) and ethnolinguistic (latter) terms, and misuse the word Adyghe to refer only to the Adyghe in Republic of Adygea (only a small part of the historical Circassian lands). The majority of the Circassians in Russia today reside in neighbouring regions of Adygea.}}

The '''Baima people''' ({{zh|t=白馬人|s=白马人|p=Báimǎ rén|l=White Horse people}}), also called '''Baima Tibetans''' ({{zh|t=白馬藏人|s=白马藏人|p=Báimǎ Zàngrén}}), are a subgroup of [[Tibetans]] living in the southeast of [[Gansu]] and the northwest of [[Sichuan]] in China, especially in [[Pingwu County|Pingwu]] and [[Jiuzhaigou County|Jiuzhaigou]] Counties of Sichuan and [[Wen County, Gansu]].

Like the [[Songpan County|Songpan]] people of Tibet, Baima people call themselves ''Bai''. Unlike [[Standard Tibetan]], the [[Baima language]] does not use a written script, although a hieroglyphic system is used in religious practice. In religion, they still keep ancient nature worship and totem worship, which practices were later influenced by [[Bon]], and in some degree they also believe [[Buddhism]] and [[Daoism]], but there are no temples or lamas (monks).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chinesefolklore.org.cn/web/index.php?NewsID=7514 &amp;#91;杨冬燕&amp;#93;（白马）藏族信仰习俗现状调查研究]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://mszx.mnu.cn/E_ReadNews.asp?NewsID=200 多元文化下的白马(氏人)文化]&lt;/ref&gt; To many of the Baima, the Mountain God is the highest god. The most important religious event for them is the Caogai Dance (曹蓋, which means [[domino]] in Baima).

The Baima people are said to be the descendants of Baima Di (白馬氐) and after [[Songtsen Gampo]] established the [[Tibetan Empire]], they gradually became part of the Tibetan people.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cn.tibetanol.com/chinese/lishi/content/2007-10/29/content_505916.htm 被历史遗忘的民族--白马藏人]{{Dead link|date=October 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Di (Five Barbarians)|Di]] (氐) were an ancient large ethnic group living in west China who were associated with the [[Qiang (historical people)|Qiang]] (羌), also called Di Qiang (氐羌).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://li-hui.net/Documents/A21.pdf |title=國立國父紀念館館刊第 14 期 164-180走向遠東的 兩個現代人種 |access-date=2013-08-25 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071004235043/http://li-hui.net/Documents/A21.pdf |archive-date=2007-10-04 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The change from their original Di language to [[Amdo]] Tibetan probably took place in the 7th century CE.&lt;ref&gt;Katia Chirkova: [http://www.wetenschapsagenda.leidenuniv.nl/index.php3-m=&amp;c=223.htm Baima: From language to dialect] (University of Leiden lecture)&lt;/ref&gt; The area Baima people live in is the region that was previously called [[Jiandi Dao]] (湔氐道) before the Tibetan empire was established.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2512">The '''Black Lamp''' was a secret and illegal [[working class]] revolutionary group that existed during the early 19th century in [[Yorkshire]].

Little documentary evidence of the group's activities survives, and historians have disputed those details that do remain. One of the most influential accounts of the group comes from historian Edward Thompson, who construed the organization as integral to the birth of British working-class [[Consciousness raising|consciousness]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fQtaeCTc5FcC&amp;pg=PA75&amp;dq=%22Black+lamp%22+yorkshire&amp;q=%22Black%20lamp%22%20yorkshire |title=Debating the revolution: Britain in the 1790s |first=Chris |last=Evans |page=75 |publisher=I.B.

[[File:Boobs on bikes (12).JPG|thumb|Right|Boobs on Bikes, 2007]]
'''Boobs on Bikes''' is a mostly annual parade of [[Toplessness|topless]] men and women riding on motorcycles through large New Zealand cities (in the past, [[Christchurch]], [[Palmerston North]], [[Hamilton, New Zealand|Hamilton]], [[Tauranga]], [[Wellington]], [[Wanganui]] and most prominently [[Auckland]]).

It is organised by pornographer Steve Crow, and started in Auckland in 2003 after two local women were arrested for baring their breasts in a public protest. Crow considered this to be a breach of the [[New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990]], which specifically prohibits discrimination of the basis of sex and Crow argued that if it is legal in New Zealand for a male to bare his breast in public, the same must apply to women. Several legal attempts to stop the parade, most notably by [[Auckland City Council]], have failed in court and the parade has been ruled legal under New Zealand legislation.

Crow has run his Boobs on Bikes parade a number of times since 2003. The event normally precedes Crow's ''[[Erotica Expo]]'',&lt;ref&gt;http://www.eroticaexpo.co.nz&lt;/ref&gt;
or as it is more correctly known, ''Erotica Lifestyles Expo'', an adults-only adult lifestyles exhibition. International porn stars who travel to New Zealand for the expo are typically part of Boobs On Bikes.

== 2006 Auckland ==
In 2006, the parade, then much smaller and less known, made headlines in Auckland, when Steve Crow asked for permission from the city council, which was granted. Strong political opposition later materialized from parts of the public and some politicians, including mayor [[Dick Hubbard]] and most of the Auckland City Councillors.&lt;ref&gt;''[https://archive.is/20120715211748/http://subs.nzherald.co.nz/section/1/story.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=10396427 Bid to ban "degrading" porn-star pageant]'' — ''[[The New Zealand Herald]]'', Wednesday 16 August 2006&lt;/ref&gt; 
Legal experts, however, concluded that the parade could not be denied by current laws (bare-breasted women not being an indecency in New Zealand in this age, as a police spokesman noted). Also, the organizers had technically asked only for assistance with traffic control for the parade and declared themselves determined to go ahead even in the face of opposition.
 
The acrimonious debate about the parade ensured that when the parade took place several weeks later, [[Queen Street, Auckland|Queen Street]] was packed with spectators. Rough counts estimate around one hundred thousand people,&lt;ref&gt;''[http://subs.nzherald.co.nz/topic/story.cfm?c_id=283&amp;objectid=10397784 Picture: Wide eyed at topless parade]{{Dead link|date=September 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}'' - ''[[The New Zealand Herald]]'', Thursday 24 August 2006&lt;/ref&gt; 
of which about one fifth were reported to be female.&lt;ref name="NZ_Herald_10397686"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/section/1/story.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=10397686 |title=Thousands on Queen St for Boobs on Bikes |date=23 August 2006 |work=[[The New Zealand Herald]] |accessdate=21 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
The 2006 parade contained about fifteen to twenty female pornstars on 26 bikes and two decommissioned army tanks.&lt;ref name="NZ_Herald_10397686"/&gt;

== 2007 Christchurch ==
[[File:Boobs on bikes (17).JPG|thumb|Boobs on Bikes event, 2007]]
The 2007 Christchurch "Boobs on Bikes" parade was held on March 2. This parade received less national media attention than the Auckland parade the year before, as unlike in Auckland, there was no attempt by city councillors to prevent it. However, Christchurch City Council did release a press statement stating that they had "not approved or received an application to hold the proposed 'Boobs on Bikes' parade on Friday, March 2, from Erotica event organisers." The press release stated that the council must be consulted for any procession that will interfere with traffic, or may require crowd management. Erotica Lifestyle Expo organiser Steve Crow has brushed this off, saying that it is a promotion, not a parade, and all rules of the road will be observed.

City council and organizers of the event say they had received numerous complaints about the parade; however, it isn't in the city's jurisdiction to act, as female toplessness is not illegal in New Zealand. Council transport and streets manager Michael Aitken told NZPA that the "standard of dress of participants is not a matter that the Council can control."

Police inspector Gary Knowles commented that it was a "moral not a criminal issue. We have taken legal advice and unless there is a breach of the peace, we cannot intervene."&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.stuff.co.nz/stuff/thepress/westcoast/3974823a10.html Chch police urged to stop "boobs on bikes"]{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}'' — [[New Zealand Press Association]] via Stuff.co.nz, Monday 26 February 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

==Opposition in Whanganui==

In March 2010, the Protect Our Youth Association began soliciting signatures for a petition against the parade, however the petition effort was abandoned after then Whanganui Mayor Michael Laws stated to P.O.Y.A. representative Holly Dahya that he would ignore any petitions against the parade, and rejected any alternative recourse to council. Laws also rejected Wanganui City Councillor Allan Anderson's attempts to open discussion on the issue within Council itself, recognising that repeated attempts by Auckland City Council to prevent the event had failed.

Crow also angered Palmerston North RSA members when he announced his parades in Palmerston North, Whanganui and Levin would take place over ANZAC weekend, with the Erotica Lifesyle Expo in Palmerston North scheduled for ANZAC day itself. In response to critics, Crow stated that it was an 'unfortunate clash of date' outside his control as that weekend (ANZAC weekend) was the only weekend available for the use of the venue.

[[Image:Brazil Geoecon CentroSul.svg|thumb|250px|Geoeconomic Region of Centro-Sul]]

'''Centro-Sul''' ({{IPA-pt|ˌsẽtɾuˈsuw}}, ''South-Central'') is the [[Southeast Region, Brazil|Southeastern]], [[Southern Region, Brazil|Southern]] and [[Central-West Region, Brazil|Central-West]] regions of [[Brazil]] (see [[Brazil Regional Division]]), excluding the north of [[Minas Gerais]] and most of [[Mato Grosso]] and along with some of [[Tocantins]].

== Demographics ==
In this region live around 135 million Brazilians. The most remarkable characteristics of the region is the human domination over the [[nature]]: only ~5% of the native vegetation is left. Other very strong characteristic is populational and economic: most industries are concentrated in the area and responsible for ~75% of the national [[Gross domestic product|GDP]]. The vast majority of the population (+90%) is of mostly European ancestry, and more than half of the population self-identify as [[White Brazilian]].

The region also is characterized by having a high standard of living ([[Human Development Index|HDI]] of ~0.787, in average), where social problems are less problematic than in other regions (at least, in rural and small-medium-sized cities).

It is not difficult to find regions and small, medium and large cities whose quality of life is similar to developed coutries.

Similar conditions to those of the First World are difficult to find in the geo-economic regions  ''Amazônia Legal'' and ''Nordeste'', in ''Amazonia Legal'' the exception is the Mato Grosso in the  agribusiness belt, but the state belongs to Central-West macro-region, 
not to the North and Northeast, where most of the Brazilian poverty is concentrated.

The ''Centro Sul'' can often be understood as the such as the junction of South, Southeast and Central-West macro-regions, although the division does not include the north of Minas Gerais and most of Mato Grosso, besides including a very small part of the Tocantins, that in the North.

This understanding is due to the fact that the three macro-regions present similar social indicators, higher than the North and Northeast.

Despite detaining the majority of the Brazilian population there is a common sense that the Centro-Sul (except the favela minority in large cities) is the least representative of the country's reality, this is due to the high social indicators that go against the concept that the country is underdeveloped.

This misconception is even more so in relation to the South, due mainly to the temperate climate, European immigration and way of life very close to the developed countries.

Although it was always the richest geoeconomic region, the resemblance to the First World is recent, even in the South, which in the 1980s was much poorer than the neighboring countries of Uruguay and Argentina.

Only the state of São Paulo presents better indicators for a longer time, due to the strong industrialization, the development of the South and Central-West regions occurred less recently with the expansion of agribusiness.

The ''Centro Sul'' now has similar development to that of Uruguay, Argentina and Chile, the richest South and Latin American countries, extreme poverty is almost eradicated in this part of Brazil while in the North and Northeast the rates are still very expressive, the similarities with the developed countries are even more evident in the South, especially Santa Catarina state, and São Paulo state.

'''Chaldean Catholics''' ({{IPAc-en|k|ae|l|'|d|i:|@n}}), known simply as '''Chaldeans''' (''Kaldāye''; {{lang|syr|ܟܠܕܝ̈ܐ}} or {{lang|syr|ܟܲܠܕܵܝܹܐ}}), are [[Assyrian people|Assyrian]] adherents of the [[Chaldean Catholic Church]] which originates from the [[Church of the East]].&lt;ref&gt;George V. Yana (Bebla), "Myth vs. Reality" JAA Studies, Vol. XIV, No. 1, 2000 p. 80&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name='BBC'&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/7271828.stm |title=Who are the Chaldean Christians? |date=March 13, 2008 |work= |publisher=[[BBC News]] |accessdate=March 26, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The community formed in the [[Upper Mesopotamia]] in the 16th and 17th centuries, originating from groups of Nestorians adhering to the [[Church of the East]] that split after the [[schism of 1552]] and entered communion with the [[Holy See]] (Catholic Church). While indigenous to the region of north [[Iraq]], southeast [[Turkey]] and northeast [[Syria]], many Chaldean Catholic Christians have migrated to [[Western civilization|Western countries]] including the United States, Canada, Australia, Sweden and Germany. Many of them also live in [[Lebanon]], [[Egypt]], [[Israel]], [[Jordan]], [[Iran]], [[Turkey]], and [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]]. The reasons for migration are [[religious persecution]], [[ethnic persecution]], the poor economic conditions during the [[sanctions against Iraq]], and poor security conditions after the [[2003 invasion of Iraq]].

==Names==
 {{see also|Terms for Syriac Christians}}

Followers of the [[Chaldean Catholic Church]] identify and are identified as "Chaldean" (''kaldāye'', ''kaldāni'', ultimately from ancient "[[Chaldea]]"). After the community [[Eastern Catholic Churches|entered communion with Rome]], the Roman Catholic Church began calling them Chaldean Catholics, wanting to differentiate them from the followers of their mother church, the Nestorians (since the 20th century called Assyrians).{{sfn|Joseph|2000|p=8}} In the past, the Chaldean name was used for both branches, but never became attached to the Nestorians.{{sfn|Joseph|2000|pp=4, 8}} The Jacobites ([[Syriac Orthodox Christians (Middle East)|Syriac Orthodox]]) and Nestorians had up until after World War I called themselves "Syrians" (Suraye/Suroyo), after which the Nestorians gradually adopted ''Aturaye'' (ancient Assyrian name in Syriac) while the Jacobites continued calling themselves ''Suroyo''.{{sfn|Joseph|2000|p=9}} 19th-century Western travel and missionary writers had popularized the Assyrian name, which was first adopted by a few educated Nestorians (especially immigrants in America) in the late 19th century.{{sfn|Joseph|2000|p=18}} In the Interwar period, in some regions, the label "Assyrians" also included Chaldeans, leading to the designation "Catholic Assyrians". {{sfn|Berg|2009|p=160}} However, the Assyrian name did not win approval in the majority of the Chaldean population.{{sfn|Berg|2009|p=160}} In recent times, the term "Chaldo-Assyrian" has gained popularity; it presents Chaldeans and Nestorians as one ethnic group.{{sfn|Berg|2009|p=160}}

In Iraq, the Chaldeans grouped together with Nestorians are officially known as "Chaldo-Assyrian" (as per Law of 2003). Iraqi Kurdish organizations often refer to Syriac Christians as Kurdish Christians, while "Chaldo-Assyrian" is the preferred name of the [[Assyrian Democratic Movement]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Karl R.

Chaldeans are mentioned as a distinct group in Article 125 of the [[Iraqi constitution]].&lt;ref name="iraqinationality.gov.iq"&gt;{{cite document|title=Iraqi Constitution|publisher=Government of Iraq|url=http://www.iraqinationality.gov.iq/attach/iraqi_constitution.pdf|journal=|access-date=2016-09-19|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161128152712/http://www.iraqinationality.gov.iq/attach/iraqi_constitution.pdf#|archive-date=2016-11-28|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In northern Iraq, the community inhabits [[Alqosh]] ({{lang|syr|ܐܠܩܘܫ}}), [[Ankawa]] ({{lang|syr|ܥܢܟܒ݂ܐ}}), [[Araden]] ({{lang|syr|ܐܪܕܢ}}), [[Baqofah]] ({{lang|syr|ܒܝܬ ܩܘܦ̮ܐ}}), [[Batnaya]] ({{lang|syr|ܒܛܢܝܐ}}), [[Karamles]] ({{lang|syr|ܟܪܡܠܫ}}), [[Mangesh, Iraq|Mangesh]] ({{lang|syr|ܡܢܓܫ}}), [[Shaqlawa]] ({{lang|syr|ܫܩܠܒ݂ܐ}}), [[Tel Isqof]] ({{lang|syr|ܬܠܐ ܙܩܝܦ̮ܐ}}), [[Tel Keppe]] ({{lang|syr|ܬܠ ܟܦܐ}}) and [[Zakho]] ({{lang|syr|ܙܟ݂ܘ}}).

===Syria, Turkey and Iran===
In Syria, adherents number 10,000; 48,594 in Turkey; 3,390 in Iran.{{sfn|CNEWA 2016}}

===Diaspora===
In Southeast Michigan there is a Chaldean community numbering 113,000 people.{{sfn|Robson|2016|p=267}} This is the largest Chaldean diaspora community outside Iraq.{{sfn|Robson|2016|p=267}} Members are Arabic- or Aramaic-speaking.{{sfn|Robson|2016|p=267}}

A small number of Chaldean Catholic families live in Israel and the Palestinian territories. Occasionally the Chaldean Patriarchate has tried to administer them through the Chaldean street residence of a currently vacant Chaldean Patriarchal Exarch in Jerusalem.

==History and origin==
{{see also|Chaldean Catholic Church|Syriac Christianity|Assyrian people}}

The Chaldean community originates from groups of adherents of the [[Church of the East]] that entered into communion with the [[Roman Catholic Church]] in the 16th and 17th centuries.{{sfn|Berg|2009|pp=155–}}&lt;ref name="BaumWinkler2003"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Wilhelm Baum|author2=Dietmar W.

Yana (Bebla)|title=Myth vs. Reality|journal=JAA Studies|volume=XIV|issue=1|year=2000|p=80}}&lt;/ref&gt; These "Nestorian" Uniates received the name "Chaldeans" from the [[Roman Curia]], which had given the ancient name ''Chaldaei'' to them.{{sfn|Becker|p=302}}

The term ''Chaldean'' in reference to followers of the Chaldean Catholic Church was historically mainly a denominational term which arose in the late 17th century and became fully established in the 19th century. It did not refer to an ethnic connection with ancient south Babylonian [[Chaldea]] and its inhabitants, which emerged during the 9th century BC after Chaldean tribes migrated from the [[Levant]] region of Urfa in North Mesopotamia to southeast Mesopotamia, and disappeared from history during the 6th century BC.{{sfn|Travis|2010}}

Chaldean Catholics are regarded ethnically and historically as a part of the [[Assyrian continuity]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Mar Raphael J Bidawid. The Assyrian Star.

===20th century===
According to a 1950 [[CIA]] report on Iraq, Chaldeans numbered 98,000 and were the largest Christian minority.&lt;ref name=CIA-1950&gt;{{cite web|title=National Intelligence Survey: Iraq: Section 43|publisher=CIA|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/readingroom/docs/DOC_0001252339.pdf|pp=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 1950 [[CIA]] report on Iraq estimated 98,000 Chaldeans, 30,000 Nestorians (Assyrians), 25,000 Syriac Catholics and 12,000 Jacobites.

===21st century===
According to estimates by the [[Catholic Church]], in Chaldean dioceses in Iraq there were 150,000 Catholics in the Archdiocese of Baghdad (2015),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Archdiocese of Baghdad (Chaldean)|url=http://www.catholic-hierarchy.org/diocese/dbgch.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; 30,000 in the Archeparchy of Arbil (2012),&lt;ref&gt;http://www.catholic-hierarchy.org/diocese/darbi.html&lt;/ref&gt; 22,300 in the Diocese of Alqosh (2012),&lt;ref&gt;http://www.catholic-hierarchy.org/diocese/dalqu.html&lt;/ref&gt; 18,800 in the Diocese of Amadiyah and Zaku (2015),&lt;ref&gt;http://www.catholic-hierarchy.org/diocese/damza.html&lt;/ref&gt; 14,100 in the Archeparchy of Mossul (2013),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Archeparchy of Mossul (Chaldean)|url=http://www.catholic-hierarchy.org/diocese/dmoch.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; 7,831 in the Archdiocese of Kerkūk (2013),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Archdiocese of Kerkūk (Chaldean)|url=http://www.catholic-hierarchy.org/diocese/dkerk.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; 1,372 in Diocese of Aqrā (2012),&lt;ref&gt;http://www.catholic-hierarchy.org/diocese/daqra.html&lt;/ref&gt; 800 in Archeparchy of Bassorah (2015),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Archeparchy of Bassorah {Basra} (Chaldean)|url=http://www.catholic-hierarchy.org/diocese/dbssr.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Identity==
===Assyrian nationalism among Chaldeans===
[[File:FlagofAssyria.svg|thumb|Assyrian flag]]
Many Chaldean Catholics identify as Assyrians or Chaldo-Assyrians. [[Raphael Bidawid]], the then patriarch of the Chaldean Catholic Church commented on the [[Assyrian name dispute]] in 2003:

: "''I personally think that these different names serve to add confusion. The original name of our Church was the ‘Church of the East’ … When a portion of the Church of the East became Catholic in the 17th Century, the name given was ‘Chaldean’ based on the Magi kings who were believed by some to have come from what once had been the land of the Chaldean, to Bethlehem. The name ‘Chaldean’ does not represent an ethnicity, just a church… We have to separate what is ethnicity and what is religion… I myself, my sect is Chaldean, but ethnically, I am [[Assyrian people|Assyrian]].''"&lt;ref name="Parpola"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Parpola, Simo | year = 2004 | title = National and Ethnic Identity in the Neo-Assyrian Empire and Assyrian Identity in Post-Empire Times | journal = [[Journal of Assyrian Academic Studies]] | volume = 18 | issue = 2 |page=22 | publisher = JAAS | url = http://www.jaas.org/edocs/v18n2/Parpola-identity_Article%20-Final.pdf | format = PDF | authorlink = Simo Parpola }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an interview with the Assyrian Star in the September–October 1974 issue, he was quoted as saying:
: "''Before I became a priest I was an Assyrian, before I became a bishop I was an Assyrian, I am an Assyrian today, tomorrow, forever, and I am proud of it''.''"&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

=== Chaldean nationalism ===
[[File:Chaldean Flag.jpg|thumb|Chaldean flag]]
Some Chaldean Catholics espouse a Chaldean ethnic identity and regard Chaldeans as a nation of its own. Some claim descent from the ancient [[Chaldea]]ns/[[Chaldees]], who resided in the far south east of Mesopotamia, however, the scholary consensus remains that modern Chaldean Catholics constitute part of the Assyrian continuity rather than being descendants of the ancient Chaldeans.{{sfn|Nisan|2002|p=?}}{{sfn|Travis|2010|p=?}}&lt;ref name="JAAS"/&gt; The first political movement of Chaldean Catholics was founded in 1972 in [[Iraq]] and named the Chaldean Patriot Movement, after the Baathist regime in Iraq killed many Chaldean Catholics in the Soria village in the [[Dohuk province]], but then this movement dissolved after persecution by the Baath regime.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alsumaria.tv/mobile/news/51371/%D8%AD%D8%B1%D9%83%D8%A9-%D9%83%D9%84%D8%AF%D8%A7%D9%86%D9%8A%D8%A9-%D8%AA%D8%AD%D8%B0%D8%B1-%D9%85%D9%86-%D8%A3%D8%B2%D9%85%D8%A9-%D9%85%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%8A%D8%A9-%D8%AE%D8%B7%D8%B1%D8%A9-%D8%A8%D8%B3%D8%A8/ar|title=اخبار - حركة كلدانية تحذر من أزمة مالية خطرة بسبب غسيل الريال الإيراني في العراق|publisher=|accessdate=22 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Official statistics in Iraq referred to all [[Syriac Christians]], including Chaldean Catholics, as ''Christian Arabs''. In 1972, the cultural rights of [[Syriac language|Syriac]]-speaking Christians in Iraq were recognised by the Iraqi government, but the Baathist regime refused to recognize Assyrians (Syriac Christians) as an ethnic group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iraqnla-iq.com/opac/fullrecr.php?nid=26280&amp;hl=ara|title=دار الكتب والوثائق العراقية » ابحث في الفهارس|publisher=|accessdate=22 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the fall of the Baath regime in [[Iraqi Kurdistan]] in 1991, some Chaldean Catholics began to establish Chaldean nationalist political parties around the Chaldean Catholic identity, in 1999 founded the [[Chaldean Democratic Party]] and in 2002 the [[Chaldean National Congress|Chaldean National Congress Party]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://solutions.cengage.com/gale/apps/|title=Apps - Access My Library - Gale|publisher=|accessdate=22 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chaldeansonline.org/chaldean/|title=Chaldean National Congress|first=Ghassan|last=Hanna|publisher=|accessdate=22 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon their demands, the [[Iraqi constitution]] of 2005 in Article 125 mentions Chaldeans as a distinct group.&lt;ref name="iraqinationality.gov.iq"/&gt; Several conferences on Chaldean nationalism were held,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://sites.google.com/site/chaldeanwriters/|title=CHALDEAN WRITERS|publisher=|accessdate=22 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kaldaya.net/2011/Articles/07_July2011/31_July25_BishopMarSarhadJamou.html|title=The Chaldean Renaissance: Basic Outline of a Vision|publisher=|accessdate=22 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a flag was designed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://chaldeanflag.com/flag.html|title=Chaldean Flag}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Condition of the Chaldean Catholic Church==
The 1896 census of the Chaldean Catholics&lt;ref&gt;Mgr. George 'Abdisho' Khayyath to the Abbé Chabot (''Revue de l'Orient Chrétien'', I, no. 4)&lt;/ref&gt; counted 233 parishes and 177 churches or chapels, mainly in northern Iraq and southeastern Turkey. The Chaldean Catholic clergy numbered 248 priests; they were assisted by the monks of the Congregation of [[Rabban Hormizd (Saint)|St. Hormizd]], who numbered about one hundred. There were about 52 Assyrian Chaldean schools (not counting those conducted by Latin nuns and missionaries). At [[Mosul]] there was a patriarchal seminary, distinct from the Chaldean seminary directed by the Dominicans. The total number of Assyrian Chaldean Christians as by 2010 was 490,371,{{sfn|CNEWA 2016}} 78,000 of whom are in the [[Chaldean Catholic Archeparchy of Mosul|Diocese of Mosul]].

The current patriarch considers [[Baghdad]] as the principal city of his see. His title of "[[List of Chaldean Catholic Patriarchs of Babylon|Patriarch of Babylon]]" results from the identification of Baghdad with ancient [[Babylon]] (however Baghdad is 55 miles north of the ancient city of Babylon and corresponds to northern [[Babylonia]]). However, the Chaldean patriarch resides habitually at [[Mosul]] in the north, and reserves for himself the direct administration of this diocese and that of Baghdad.

There are five archbishops (resident respectively at [[Basra]], [[Diyarbakır]], [[Kirkuk]], [[Salmas]] and [[Urmia]]) and seven bishops. Eight patriarchal vicars govern the small Assyrian Chaldean communities dispersed throughout Turkey and Iran. The Chaldean clergy, especially the monks of [[Rabban Hormizd Monastery]], have established some missionary stations in the mountain districts dominated by [[The Assyrian Church of the East]]. Three dioceses are in Iran, the others in Turkey.

The liturgical language of the Chaldean Catholic Church is [[Syriac language|Syriac]] and the liturgy of the Chaldean Church is written in the [[Syriac alphabet]]. The literary revival in the early 20th century was mostly due to the [[Lazarist]] [[Paul Bedjan|Pere Bedjan]], an ethnic [[Assyrian people|Assyrian]] Chaldean Catholic from northwestern Iran. He popularized the ancient chronicles, the lives of [[Assyria]]n saints and martyrs, and even works of the ancient Assyrian doctors among Assyrians of all denominations, including Chaldean Catholics, Syriac Orthodox, Assyrian Church of the East and Assyrian Protestants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|url = http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03559a.htm
|title = New Advent Catholic Encyclopedia }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before the [[Gulf War]], Chaldean Catholics numbered approximately 400,000{{sfn|CNEWA 2016}} of Iraq's estimated 800,000-1,000,000 [[Assyrian people|Assyrian Christians]], with smaller numbers found among the Assyrian Christian communities of northeast Syria, southeast Turkey, northwest Iran, Lebanon, Jordan, Israel, Georgia and Armenia.{{sfn|BBC 2008}} Perhaps the best known Iraqi Chaldean Catholic is the former Iraqi deputy prime minister, [[Tariq Aziz]] (real name Michael Youhanna).{{sfn|BBC 2008}}

Hundreds of thousands of [[Assyrian Christians]] of all denominations have left Iraq since the ousting of [[Saddam Hussein]] in 2003. At least 20,000 of them have fled through Lebanon to seek resettlement in Europe and the US.&lt;ref&gt;Martin Chulov (2010) [https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/dec/23/iraq-christian-exodus-christmas "Christian exodus from Iraq gathers pace"]''The Guardian'', retrieved June 12, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2008, Chaldean Catholic Archbishop [[Paulos Faraj Rahho]] of Mosul was kidnapped, and found dead two weeks later. [[Pope Benedict XVI]] condemned his death. Sunni and Shia leaders also expressed their condemnation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4354">The '''Charles S. Mott Prize''' was awarded annually by the General Motors Cancer Research Foundation as one of a trio of scientific prizes entirely devoted to cancer research, the other two being the Charles F. [[Kettering Prize]] and the [[Alfred P. Sloan, Jr. Prize]]. The prizes, worth US$250,000, were awarded annually between 1979 and 2005. The awards were generally considered the most prestigious in the field.&lt;ref name="Cancer Research 1999 pp. 1673s–1673s"&gt;{{cite journal | title=Laureates: General Motors Cancer Research Awards | journal=Cancer Research | volume=59 | issue=7 Supplement | date=1 March 1999 | issn=0008-5472 | pages=1673s | url=http://cancerres.aacrjournals.org/content/59/7_Supplement/1673s | access-date=20 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The Mott Prize was awarded for "the most outstanding recent contribution related to the cause or prevention of cancer". In 2006, due to financial pressures on the corporation supporting the Foundation, the three awards were consolidated into a single $250,000 General Motors Cancer Research Award.{{who|date=August 2012}}{{cite needed|date=August 2012}}. In 2006, the first and only winner of the General Motors Cancer Research Award was [[Napoleone Ferrara]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.landesbioscience.com/journals/cbt/article/3155/ ''Napoleone Ferrara wins 2006 GM Cancer Research Award.''

{{Hinduism}}
'''Cheti Chand''' (चेटी चन्ड) is a festival which marks the beginning of the [[Hindu New Year]] for the [[Sindhi Hindus]].&lt;ref name="Falzon2004p62"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ramey2008p8"&gt;{{cite book|author=S. Ramey|title=Hindu, Sufi, or Sikh: Contested Practices and Identifications of Sindhi Hindus in India and Beyond|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Bv2ADAAAQBAJ|year=2008|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|isbn=978-0-230-61622-6|pages=8, 36}}&lt;/ref&gt; The festival date is based on the lunar cycle of the lunisolar [[Hindu calendar]], it being the first day of the year and the Sindhi month of ''Chet'' (Chaitra).&lt;ref name="Falzon2004p62"&gt;{{cite book|author=Mark-Anthony Falzon|title=Cosmopolitan Connections: The Sindhi Diaspora, 1860–2000|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ljbS-I5Y8WMC&amp;pg=PA62|year=2004|publisher=BRILL|isbn=90-04-14008-5|pages=60-63}}&lt;/ref&gt; It typically falls in late March or early April in the [[Gregorian calendar]] on or about the same day as [[Gudi Padwa]] in Maharashtra and [[Ugadi]] in other parts of the Deccan region of India.

The festival marks the arrival of spring and harvest, but in Sindhi community it also marks the mythical birth of Uderolal in year 1007, after they prayed to Hindu god Varuna to save them from the persecution by tyrannical Muslim ruler named Mirkhshah.&lt;ref name=falzon159/&gt;&lt;ref name=kumar120&gt;{{cite book|author=P. Pratap Kumar|title=Contemporary Hinduism|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=7Wd_BAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA120|year= 2014|publisher= Routledge|isbn=978-1-317-54636-8|pages= 120–124}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ramey2008p8"/&gt; Uderolal morphed into a warrior and old man who preached and reprimanded Mirkhshah that Muslims and Hindus deserve the same religious freedoms. He, as Jhulelal,&lt;ref name="Ramey2008p8"/&gt; became the champion of the people in Sindh, from both religions. Among his [[Sufi]] Muslim followers, Jhulelal is known as "Khwaja Khizir" or "Sheikh Tahit". The Hindu Sindhi, according to this legend, celebrate the new year as Uderolal's birthday.&lt;ref name="Ramey2008p8"/&gt;&lt;ref name=falzon159&gt;{{cite book|author=Mark-Anthony Falzon|title=Cosmopolitan Connections: The Sindhi Diaspora, 1860-2000|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=ljbS-I5Y8WMC&amp;pg=PA59|year=2004|publisher=BRILL|isbn=90-04-14008-5|pages=58-60}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The tradition likely started with Daryapanthis. During the British colonial rule era, major annual fairs (''melas'') used to be held in Uderolal and Zindapir (near Hyderabad, Pakistan).&lt;ref name="Falzon2004p62"/&gt; In contemporary times, the Sindhi community celebrates the festival of Cheti Chand with major fairs, feast parties, processions with ''jhankis'' (glimpse stage) of Jhulelal (an avatar of [[Vishnu]], similar to [[Vithoba]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Mark-Anthony Falzon|title=Cosmopolitan Connections: The Sindhi Diaspora, 1860-2000|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ljbS-I5Y8WMC&amp;pg=PA62|year=2004|publisher=BRILL|isbn=90-04-14008-5|page=60}}&lt;/ref&gt; other Hindu deities, and social dancing.&lt;ref name="Falzon2004p62"/&gt;

On this day, many [[Sindhis]] take Baharana Sahib to a nearby [[river]] or [[lake]]. Baharana Sahib consists of Jyot (oil lamp), Misiri (crystal sugar), Fota ([[cardamom]]), Fal (fruits), and Akha. Behind is Kalash (water jar) and a Nariyal ([[coconut]]) in it, covered with [[cloth]], phool ([[flowers]]) and patta ([[leaves]]).{{cn|date=March 2017}} There is also a [[Murti]] (statue) of Pujya Jhulelal Devta. It has been a major festival of Sindhis in India and Pakistan,&lt;ref name=ramey125/&gt; one also celebrated by the [[Sindhi diaspora]] around the world.&lt;ref name="Falzon2004p62"/&gt;&lt;ref name=kumar120/&gt;

'''Corsican''' (''corsu'' {{IPA-co|ˈkorsu|}} or ''lingua corsa'' {{IPA-co|ˈliŋɡwa ˈɡorsa}}) is a [[Romance languages|Romance language]] within the [[Italo-Dalmatian languages|Italo-Dalmatian subfamily]]. It is closely related to [[Tuscan dialect|Tuscan]], and thus to Tuscan-based [[Italian language|Italian]]. In its Northern varieties especially, mutual intelligibility between Corsican and Italian is high. Varieties of Corsican are spoken, and to some extent written, on the islands of [[Corsica]] ([[France]]) and northern [[Sardinia]] ([[Italy]]). Corsican used to play the role of a [[vernacular]], while [[Italian language|Italian]] was the official language in Corsica until 1859; afterwards Italian was replaced by [[French language|French]], owing to the acquisition of the island by France from the [[Republic of Genoa]] in 1768. Over the next two centuries, the use of French grew to the extent that, by the [[Liberation of France|Liberation]] in 1945, all islanders had a working knowledge of French. The 20th century saw a wholesale language shift, with islanders changing their language practices to the extent that there were no monolingual Corsican speakers left by the 1960s. By 1995, an estimated 65 percent of islanders had some degree of proficiency in Corsican,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unesco.org/languages-atlas/en/atlasmap/language-id-340.html|title=UNESCO Atlas of the World's Languages in danger|author=|date=|website=www.unesco.org|accessdate=18 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a small minority, perhaps 10 percent, used Corsican as a first language.&lt;ref name=cif&gt;{{cite web|title=Corsican in France|url=http://www.uoc.edu/euromosaic/web/homean/index1.html|publisher=Euromosaic|accessdate=2008-06-13}} To access the data, click on List by languages, Corsican, Corsican in France, then scroll to ''Geographical and language background''.&lt;/ref&gt;

As for Corsican, a bone of contention is whether it should be considered an Italian [[dialect]] or its own [[language]]. Usually, it is not possible to ascertain what an author means by these terms. For example, one might read from some scholars that Corsican either belongs to the "Centro-Southern [[Languages of Italy|Italian dialects]]" along with Tuscan and the Tuscan-based standard Italian, [[Neapolitan language|Neapolitan]] and others&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|url=http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761560079/italian_language.html |title=Italian Language |publisher=Encarta |accessdate=2008-06-13 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5kwaudYBC?url=http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761560079/italian_language.html |archivedate=2009-10-31 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{better reference needed|date=June 2018}} or that it is "closely related to the Tuscan dialect of Italian".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eurolang.net/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=72&amp;Itemid=52&amp;lang=en|title=Eurolang report on Corsican|accessdate=2008-06-13|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090223072328/http://www.eurolang.net/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=72&amp;Itemid=52&amp;lang=en|archivedate=2009-02-23|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{failed verification|date=June 2018}}

The matter is controversial, as the island was historically and culturally bound to the Italian Mainland from the Middle Ages up until the 19th century, and installed in a diglossic system where both Corsican and Italian were perceived as two sociolinguistic levels of the same language;&lt;ref&gt;&lt;&lt;Pendant des siècles, toscan et corse ont formé un couple perçu par les locuteurs comme deux niveaux de la même langue.&gt;&gt; Fusina, Ghjacumu; Ettori, Fernand (1981). ''Langue Corse Incertitudes et Paris'', Ajaccio, Scola Corsa, pg.81&lt;/ref&gt; Corsican and Italian traditionally existed on a spectrum, whose proximity line was blurred enough that the locals needed little else but a change of register to communicate with the standard Italian-speaking elites and administration. "Tuscanising" their tongue allowed for a practice of code-mixing typical of the Mainland Italian dialects.&lt;ref&gt;Arrighi, Jean-Marie (2002). ''Histoire de la Corse'', Edition Jean-Paul Gisserot, Paris, pg.51&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Toso, Fiorenzo. ''Lo spazio linguistico corso tra insularità e destino di frontiera'', Università di Udine&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the geographical proximity, it has indeed been noted that the closest linguistic neighbour to Corsican is not [[Sardinian language|Sardinian]], which is a separate group, but rather Tuscan and the extreme Southern Italian lects like [[Sicilian language|Siculo]]-[[Languages of Calabria|Calabrian]].&lt;ref&gt;&lt;&lt;It may come as a surprise that the closest [linguistic] neighbor is not Sardinian, even if it is so close geographically. The closest neighbor is to be found in meridional Italy, especially in Calabrian. A Southern Corsican, speaking Corsican in Tuscany, will be identified as being Calabrian; a Northern Corsican, speaking Corsican in inner Sardinia, will be identified as being Italian; and, finally, a Sardinian speaking Sardinian in the [Italian] peninsula would not be understood at all.&gt;&gt; Original quote: &lt;&lt;On sera peut-être surpris de constater que la plus proche parenté n'est pas avec le sarde, pourtant si proche dans l'espace, mais avec les dialectes de l'Italie méridionale, notamment le calabrais. Un Corse du Sud parlant corse en toscane sera identifié comme calabrais; un corse du nord parlant corse en Sardaigne centrale sera identifié comme italien; quand à un sarde parlant sarde dan la péninsule, il ne sera pas compris.&gt;&gt; Fusina, Ghjacumu; Ettori, Fernand (1981). ''Langue Corse Incertitudes et Paris'', Ajaccio, Scola Corsa, pg.12&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the characteristics of standard Italian is the retention of the -''re'' infinitive ending, as in Latin ''mittere'' "send". Such infinitival ending is [[Tuscan dialect#Loss of infinitival "-re"|lost in Tuscan]] as well as Corsican, which has ''mette'' / ''metta'', "to put". The Latin relative pronouns ''qui''/''quae'' "who", and ''quod'' "what", are [[inflected]] in Latin; whereas the relative pronoun in Italian for "who" is ''chi'' and "what" is ''che''/''(che) cosa'', it is an uninflected ''chì'' in Corsican. The biggest difference between standard Italian and Corsican is that the latter uses the ''u'' termination, whereas standard Italian uses the ''o'' ending. For example, the Italian demonstrative pronouns ''questo'' "this" and ''quello'' "that" become in Corsican ''questu'' or ''quistu'' and ''quellu'' or ''quiddu''. This feature was typical of the early Italian texts during the Middle Ages.

== Origins ==
The Corsican language has been influenced by the languages of the major powers taking an interest in Corsican affairs; earlier by those of the medieval Italian powers: [[Tuscany]] (828–1077), [[Pisa]] (1077–1282) and [[Genoa]] (1282–1768), more recently by France (1768–present), which, since 1789, has promulgated the official Parisian French. The term ''gallicised Corsican'' refers to Corsican up to about the year 1950. The term ''distanciated Corsican'' refers to an idealized Corsican from which various agents have removed French or other elements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Corsican distanciation strategies: Language purification or misguided attempts to reverse the gallicisation process?|first=Robert J.|last=Blackwood|journal=Multilingua – Journal of Cross-Cultural and Interlanguage Communication|volume=23|issue=3|pages=233–255|date=August 2004|format=PDF|url=http://www.reference-global.com/doi/abs/10.1515/mult.2004.011?cookieSet=1|accessdate=2008-06-13|doi=10.1515/mult.2004.011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The common relationship between Corsica and central Italy can be traced as far back as the [[Etruscans]], who asserted their presence on the island in as early as 500 BC.&lt;ref&gt;Jehasse, Olivier. ''Corsica'' in ''Etruscology'' (Edited by Alessandro Naso), 2017&lt;/ref&gt; In 40 AD, the natives of Corsica did not reportedly speak [[Latin]]. The Roman exile, [[Seneca the Younger]], reports that both coast and interior were occupied by natives whose language he did not understand (see [[Prehistory of Corsica#Ligurian hypothesis|the Ligurian hypothesis]]). Whatever language was spoken is still visible in the toponymy or in some words, for instance in the [[Gallurese dialect]] spoken in Sardinia ''zerru'' 'pig'. A similar situation is valid for [[Sardinian language|Sardinian]] and [[Sicilian language|Sicilian]]. The occupation of the island by the [[Vandals]] around the year 469 marked the end of authoritative influence by Latin speakers (see [[Medieval Corsica]]). If the natives of that time spoke Latin, they must have acquired it during the late empire. It has been theorised that a [[Sardinian language|Sardinian]] variety might have been spoken in Corsica, prior to the island's [[Tuscan dialect|Tuscanisation]] under [[Pisa]]n and [[Genoa|Genoese]] rule.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.britannica.com/topic/Sardinian-language ''Sardinian language'', Encyclopedia Britannica]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Dialects ==
===Corsica===
The two most widely spoken forms of the Corsican language are the groups spoken in the [[Bastia]] and [[Corte, Haute-Corse|Corte]] area (generally throughout the northern half of the island, known as [[Haute-Corse]], ''Cismonte'' or ''Corsica suprana''), and the groups spoken around [[Sartène]] and [[Porto-Vecchio]] (generally throughout the southern half of the island, known as [[Corse-du-Sud]], ''Pumonti'' or ''Corsica suttana''). The dialect of [[Ajaccio]] has been described as in transition. The dialects spoken at [[Calvi, Haute-Corse|Calvi]] and [[Bonifacio, Corse-du-Sud|Bonifacio]] are closer to the [[Genoa|Genoese]] dialect, also known as [[Ligurian language (Romance)|Ligurian]].

This division along the Girolata-Porto Vecchio line was due to the massive immigration from Tuscany which took place in Corsica during the lower Middle Ages: as a result, the northern Corsican dialects became very close to a central Italian dialect like Tuscan, while the southern Corsican varieties could keep the original characteristics of the language which make it much more similar to [[Sicilian language|Sicilian]] and, only to some extent, [[Sardinian language|Sardinian]].

====Northern Corsican====
The Northern Corsican macro variety (''Supranacciu'', ''Supranu'', ''Cismuntincu'' or ''Cismontano'') is the most widespread on the island and standardised as well, and is spoken in North-West Corsica around the districts of Bastia and Corte. The dialect of Bastia and [[Cap Corse]] might be included among the Tuscan dialects, being they the closest form to standard Italian than any other Italo-Dalmatian dialects, with the exception of [[Florentine dialect|Florentine]]. All the dialects presenting, in addition to what has already been stated, the conditional tense as being formed by the blend of Infinitive and the Remote Past Tense of ''avè'' (e.g. ''ella amarebbe'' "she would love") are generally considered ''Cismontani'' dialects, situated north of a line uniting the villages of [[Piana]], [[Vico, Corse-du-Sud|Vico]], [[Vizzavona]], [[Ghisoni]] and [[Ghisonaccia]], and also covering the subgroups from the Cap Corse (which, unlike the rest of the island and similarly to Italian, uses ''lu'', ''li'', ''la'', ''le'' as definite articles), Bastia (besides i&gt;e and a&gt;e, u&gt;o: ''ottanta'', ''momentu'', ''toccà'', ''continentale''; a&gt;o: ''oliva'', ''orechja'', ''ocellu''), Balagna, Niolo and Corte (which retain the general Corsican traits: ''distinu'', ''ghjinnaghju'', ''sicondu'', ''billezza'', ''apartu'', ''farru'', ''marcuri'', ''cantaraghju'', ''uttanta'', ''mumentu'', ''tuccà'', ''cuntinentale'', ''aliva'', ''arechja'', ''acellu'').

====Transitional Area====
Across the Northern and Southern borders of the line separating the Northern dialects from the Southern ones, there is a transitional area picking up linguistic phenomena associated to either of the two groups, with some local peculiarities. Along the Northern line, are the dialects around [[Piana]] and [[Calcatoggio]], from Cinarca with [[Vizzavona]] (which form the conditional tense like in the South), and Fiumorbo through Ghisonaccia and Ghisoni, which present the retroflex sound ''ɖ''; along the Southern line, one can spot the dialects of Ajaccio (having the cacuminal sound ''ɖ'' evolving from the ''ll'' nexus, the pronunciation of -''ghj''-, the feminine plurals ending in ''i'', some Northern words like ''cane'' and ''accattà'' instead of ''ghjacaru'' and ''cumprà'', as well as ''ellu''/''ella'' and not ''eddu''/''edda''; minor variations: ''sabbatu''&gt;''sabbitu'', ''u li dà''&gt;''ghi lu dà''; final syllable often stressed and truncated: ''marinari''&gt;''marinà'', ''panatteri''&gt;''panattè'', ''castellu''&gt;''castè'', ''cuchjari''&gt;''cuchjà''), the [[Gravona]] area, [[Bastelica]] (which would be classified as Southern, but is also noted for its typical rhotacism: ''Basterga'') and Solenzara, which did not preserve the short Latin vowels: ''seccu'', ''peru'', ''rossu'', ''croci'', ''pozzu'').

====Southern Corsican====
The Southern Corsican macro variety (''Suttanacciu'', ''Suttanu'', ''Pumontincu'' or ''Oltramontano'') is the most archaic and conservative group, spoken in the districts of Sartène and Porto-Vecchio. Unlike the Northern varieties and similarly to Sardinian, such group retains the distinction of the short Latin vowels ''ĭ'' e ''ŭ'' (e.g. ''pilu'', ''bucca''). It is also strongly marked by the presence of the [[voiced retroflex stop]], like Sicilian (e.g. ''aceddu'', ''beddu'', ''quiddu'', ''ziteddu'', ''famidda''), and the conditional tense as being formed by the blend of Infinitive and the Imperfect Tense of ''avè'' (e.g. ''idda amarìa'' "she would love"). All the ''Oltramontani'' dialects are from an area located to the South of Porticcio, [[Bastelica]], Col di Verde and Solenzara. Notable dialects are those from around [[Taravo]] (cacuminal -''dd''- only for the -''ll'' nexus: ''frateddu'', ''suredda'', ''beddu''; but preservation of the [[palatal lateral approximant]]: ''piglià'', ''famiglia'', ''figliolu'', ''vogliu''; it does not preserve the short Latin vowels: ''seccu'', ''peru'', ''rossu'', ''croci'', ''pozzu''), Sartène (preserving the short Latin vowels: ''siccu'', ''piru'', ''russu'', ''cruci'', ''puzzu''; changing the ''rn'' nexus to ''rr'': ''forru'', ''carri'', ''corru''; presenting the voiced retroflex stop in place of the palatal lateral approximant: ''piddà'', ''famidda'', ''fiddolu'', ''voddu''; imperfect tense like ''cantàvami'', ''cantàvani''; masculing plurals ending in ''a'': ''l'ochja'', ''i poma''; having ''eddu/edda/eddi'' as personal pronouns), the Alta Rocca (the most conservative area in Corsica, being very close to the varieties spoken in Northern Sardinia), and the Southern region located between Porto-Vecchio and Bonifacio's hinterlands (masculin singulars always ending in ''u'': ''fiumu'', ''paesu'', ''patronu''; masculin plurals always ending in ''a'': ''i letta'', ''i solda'', ''i ponta'', ''i foca'', ''i mura'', ''i loca'', ''i balcona''; imperfect tense like ''cantàiami'', ''cantàiani'').

[[Image:Gallurese.png|right|thumb|250px|Languages in northern [[Sardinia]]]]

===Sardinia===
{{Main|Gallurese dialect|Sassarese language}}
The Gallurese variety is spoken in the extreme north of [[Sardinia]], including the region of [[Gallura]] and the archipelago of [[La Maddalena]], and [[Sassarese language|Sassarese]] is spoken in [[Sassari]] and in its neighbourhood, in the northwest of [[Sardinia]]. Whether the two should be included either in Corsican or in Sardinian as dialects or considered independent languages is still subject of debate.

On [[Maddalena archipelago]] the local dialect (called ''Isulanu, Maddaleninu, Maddalenino'') was brought by fishermen and shepherds from Bonifacio during immigration in the 17th and 18th centuries. Though influenced by Gallurese, it has maintained the original characteristics of Corsican. There are also numerous words of [[Genoese dialect|Genoese]] and [[Ponza|Ponzese]] origin.&lt;ref name=e18/&gt;

On October 14, 1997, Article 2 Item 4 of Law Number 26 of the Autonomous Region of Sardinia granted "''al dialetto sassarese e a quello gallurese''" – equal legal status with the other languages on [[Sardinia]]. They are thus legally defined as different languages from [[Sardinian language|Sardinian]] by the Sardinian government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.regione.sardegna.it/j/v/86?v=9&amp;c=72&amp;s=1&amp;file=1997026|title= Legge Regionale 15 ottobre 1997, n. 26|accessdate=2008-06-16|author=Autonomous Region of Sardinia|date=1997-10-15|pages=Art. 2, paragraph 4|language=it}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Number of speakers ==
The January 2007 estimated population of Corsica was 281,000, whereas the figure for the March 1999 census, when most of the studies—though not the linguistic survey work referenced in this article—were performed, was about 261,000 (see under [[Corsica]]). Only a fraction of the population at either time spoke Corsican with any fluency.

The use of Corsican language over French language has been declining. In 1980 about 70 percent of the population of the island "had some command of the Corsican language."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Corsican language use survey|url=http://www.uoc.es/euromosaic/web/homean/index1.html|publisher=Euromosaic|accessdate=2008-06-13}} To find this statement and the supporting data click on List by languages, Corsican, Corsican language use survey and look under ''INTRODUCTION''.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1990 out of a total population of about 254,000 the percentage had declined to 50 percent, with only 10 percent using it as a first language.&lt;ref name=cif/&gt;  (These figures do not count varieties of Corsican spoken in Sardinia.)  The language appeared to be in serious decline when the French government reversed its unsupportive stand and initiated some strong measures to save it.

According to an official survey run on behalf of the ''Collectivité territoriale de Corse'' which took place in April 2013, in Corsica the Corsican language has a number of speakers situated between 86,800 and 130,200, out of a total population amounting to 309,693 inhabitants.&lt;ref name=inch&gt;{{cite web|title=Inchiesta sociolinguistica nant'à a lingua corsa|url=http://www.corse.fr/linguacorsa/Inchiesta-sociolinguistica-nant-a-a-lingua-corsa_a123.html|website=www.corse.fr|publisher=Collectivité territoriale de Corse|accessdate=4 December 2014|language=co}}&lt;/ref&gt; The percentage of those who have a solid knowledge of the language varies between a minimum of 25 percent in the 25-34 age group and the maximum of 65 percent in the over-65 age group: almost a quarter of the former age group does not understand Corsican, while only a small minority of the older people do not understand it.&lt;ref name=inch/&gt; While 32 percent of the population of northern Corsica speaks Corsican quite well, this percentage drops to 22 percent for South Corsica.&lt;ref name=inch/&gt; Moreover, 10 percent of the population of Corsica speaks only French, while 62 percent speak both French and Corsican.&lt;ref name=inch/&gt; However, only 8 percent of the Corsicans know how to write correctly in Corsican, while about 60 percent of the population does not know how to write in Corsican.&lt;ref name=inch/&gt; While 90 percent of the population is in favor of a Corsican-French bilingualism, 3 percent would like to have Corsican as the only official language in the island, and 7 percent would prefer French in this role.&lt;ref name=inch/&gt;

[[UNESCO]] classifies Corsican as a "definitely endangered language."&lt;ref&gt;Moseley, Christopher (ed.). 2010. Atlas of the World's Languages in Danger, 3rd edn. Paris, UNESCO Publishing. [http://www.unesco.org/culture/languages-atlas/ Here is the online version]&lt;/ref&gt; The Corsican language is a key vehicle for Corsican culture, which is notably rich in [[proverb]]s and in [[polyphony|polyphonic]] song.

== Governmental support ==
[[Image:Corsican nationalism.jpg|thumb|287px|Bilingual road-signs, with official ([[Institut géographique national|IGN]]) French names (often in Italian) being crossed out by some local [[Corsican nationalism|nationalists]].]]
When the French Assembly passed the Deixonne Law in 1951, which made it possible for regional languages to be taught at school, [[Alsatian dialect|Alsatian]], [[French Flemish|Flemish]] and Corsican were not included on the ground of being classified as ''dialectes allogènes'' of German, Dutch and Italian respectively;&lt;ref&gt;Delamotte-Legrand, Régine; François, Frédéric; Porcher, Louis (1997). ''Langage, éthique, éducation: Perspectives croisées'', Publications de l'Université de Rouen et du Havre&lt;/ref&gt; only in 1974 were they too politically recognized as regional languages for their teaching on a voluntary basis.

The 1991 "Joxe Statute", in setting up the Collectivité Territoriale de Corse, also provided for the [[Corsican Assembly]], and charged it with developing a plan for the optional teaching of Corsican. The [[University of Corsica Pasquale Paoli]] at [[Corte, Haute-Corse]] took a central role in the planning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Insular Autonomy: A Framework for Conflict Settlement?

At the primary school level Corsican is taught up to a fixed number of hours per week (three in the year 2000) and is a voluntary subject at the secondary school level,&lt;ref&gt;(French) [http://www.ac-corse.fr/lcc_20/file/1890/ Dispositif académique d’enseignement de la langue corse dans le premier degré, année scolaire 2010-2011], Academy of Corsica&lt;/ref&gt; but is required at the University of Corsica. It is available through adult education. It can be spoken in court or in the conduct of other government business if the officials concerned speak it. The Cultural Council of the Corsican Assembly advocates for its use, for example, on public signs.

== Literature ==
According to the anthropologist Dumenica Verdoni, writing new literature in modern Corsican, known as the ''Riacquistu'', is an integral part of affirming Corsican identity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Etat/identités:de la culture du conflit à la culture du projet|url=http://www.interromania.com/studii/sunta/verdoni/etats_identites.htm|first=Dumenica|last=Verdoni|publisher=Centru Culturale Universita di Corsica|work=InterRomania|accessdate=2008-06-17|language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some individuals have returned from careers in continental France to write in Corsican, including Dumenicu Togniotti, director of the ''Teatru Paisanu'', which produced polyphonic musicals, 1973–1982, followed in 1980 by Michel Raffaelli's ''Teatru di a Testa Mora'', and Saveriu Valentini's ''Teatru Cupabbia'' in 1984.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|page=53|title=Music and Gender: Perspectives from the Mediterranean|first=Tullia|last=Magrini|year=2003|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=0-226-50166-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Modern prose writers include Alanu di Meglio, Ghjacumu Fusina, Lucia Santucci, and Marcu Biancarelli.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Corsican Literature Today|first=Paul-Michel|last=Filippi|journal=Transcript|issue=17|year=2008|url=http://www.transcript-review.org/section.cfm?id=226&amp;lan=en|accessdate=2008-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ferdinand Gregorovius]], 19th century traveller and enthusiast of Corsican culture, reported that the preferred form of the literary tradition of his time was the ''vocero'', a type of polyphonic ballad originating from funeral obsequies. These laments were similar in form to the chorales of Greek drama except that the leader could improvise. Some performers were noted at this, such as the 1700s Mariola della Piazzole and Clorinda Franseschi.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|pages=275–312|title=Corsica in Its Picturesque, Social, and Historical Aspects: the Records of a Tour in the Summer of 1852|first=Ferndinand|last=Gregorovius|authorlink=Ferdinand Gregorovius |others=Russell Martineau (trans.) |publisher=Longman, Brown, Green and Longmans|location=London|year=1855}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, the trail of written popular literature of known date in Corsican currently goes no further back than the 17th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Corsican Language|url=http://www.transcript-review.org/section.cfm?id=227&amp;lan=en|journal=Transcript|first=Francis (Translator)|last=Beretti|issue=17|year=2008|accessdate=2008-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; An undated corpus of proverbs from communes may well precede it (see under ''External links'' below). Corsican has also left a trail of legal documents ending in the late 12th century. At that time the monasteries held considerable land on Corsica and many of the churchmen were [[Notary|notaries]].

Between 1200 and 1425 the monastery of [[Gorgona, Italy|Gorgona]], which belonged to the [[Order of Saint Benedict]] for much of that time and was in the territory of [[Pisa]], acquired about 40 legal papers of various sorts related to Corsica. As the church was replacing Pisan prelates with Corsican ones there, the legal language shows a transition from entirely Latin through partially Latin and partially Corsican to entirely Corsican. The first known surviving document containing some Corsican is a bill of sale from [[Patrimonio]] dated to 1220.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |url=http://elec.enc.sorbonne.fr/CID2003/scalfati |title=Latin et langue vernaculaire dans les actes notariés corses XIe-XVe siècle |last1=Scalfati |first1=Silio P.

Research into earlier evidence of Corsican is ongoing.

== Alphabet and spelling ==
[[File:FuneraryInscriptionInErbaggio.jpg|thumb|Funerary Inscription In Corsican language at the cemetery of Erbaggio ([[Nocario]])]]
{{Main|Corsican alphabet}}
Corsican is written in the standard [[Latin script]], using 21 of the letters for native words. The letters j, k, w, x, and y are found only in foreign names and French vocabulary. The digraphs and trigraphs ''chj'', ''ghj'', ''sc'' and ''sg'' are also defined as "letters" of the alphabet in its modern scholarly form (compare the presence of ''ch'' or ''ll'' in the old Spanish alphabet) and appear respectively after ''c'', ''g'' and ''s''.

The primary diacritic used is the [[grave accent]], indicating word stress when it is not [[penult]]imate. In scholarly contexts, [[syllable|disyllables]] may be distinguished from [[diphthong]]s by use of the [[diaeresis (diacritic)|diaeresis]] on the former vowel (as in Italian and distinct from French and English). In older writing, the [[acute accent]] is sometimes found on stressed {{angle bracket|e}}, the [[circumflex]] on stressed {{angle bracket|o}}, indicating respectively ({{IPA|/e/}}) and ({{IPA|/o/}}) phonemes.

Corsican has been regarded as a dialect of Italian historically, similar to the Romance lects developed on the Italian peninsula, and in writing, it also resembles Italian (with the generalised substitution of -''u'' for final -''o'' and the articles ''u'' and ''a'' for ''il/lo'' and ''la'' respectively; however, both the dialect of [[Cap Corse]] and Gallurese retain the original articles ''lu'' and ''la''). On the other hand, the phonemes of the modern Corsican dialects have undergone complex and sometimes irregular phenomena depending on phonological context, so the pronunciation of the language for foreigners familiar with other Romance languages is not straightforward.

== Phonology ==

=== Vowels ===
As in Italian, the grapheme {{angle bracket|i}} appears in some [[Digraph (orthography)|digraphs]] and [[trigraph (orthography)|trigraphs]] in which it does not represent the phonemic vowel. All vowels are pronounced except in a few well-defined instances. {{angle bracket|i}} is not pronounced between {{angle bracket|sc/sg/c/g}} and {{angle bracket|a/o/u}}: ''sciarpa'' {{IPA|[ˈʃarpa]}}; or initially in some words: ''istu'' {{IPA|[ˈstu]}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=La prononciation des voyelles|url=http://pagesperso-orange.fr/gbatti-alinguacorsa/|publisher=A Lingua Corsa|date=April 19, 2008|accessdate=2008-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Vowels may be nasalized before {{angle bracket|n}} (which is assimilated to {{angle bracket|m}} before {{angle bracket|p}} or {{angle bracket|b}}) and the palatal nasal consonant represented by {{angle bracket|gn}}. The nasal vowels are represented by the vowel plus {{angle bracket|n}}, {{angle bracket|m}} or {{angle bracket|gn}}. The combination is a digraph or trigraph indicating the nasalized vowel. The consonant is pronounced in weakened form. The same combination of letters might not be the digraph or trigraph but might be just the non-nasal vowel followed by the consonant at full weight. The speaker must know the difference. Example of nasal: {{angle bracket|pane}} is pronounced {{IPA|[ˈpãnɛ]}} and not {{IPA|[ˈpanɛ]}}.

The Northern and central dialects in the vicinity of the [[Taravo]] river adopt the Italian seven-vowel system, whereas all the Southern ones around the so-called "archaic zone" with its centre being the town of Sartène (including the [[Gallurese]] dialect spoken in Northern Sardinia) resort to a five-vowel system without length differentiation, like [[Sardinian language|Sardinian]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.treccani.it/enciclopedia/dialetti-corsi_(Enciclopedia-dell'Italiano)/|title=corsi, dialetti  in "Enciclopedia dell'Italiano"|author=|date=|website=www.treccani.it|accessdate=18 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sono nato in Corsica e vi ho passato gli anni migliori della mia giovinezza. Ricordo, quando eravamo ragazzi, che le nostre mamme ci mandavano da soli a fare il bagno. Allora la spiaggia era piena di sabbia, senza scogli né rocce e si stava in mare delle ore fino a quando, paonazzi dal freddo poi ci andavamo a rotolare in quella sabbia bollente dal sole. Poi l'ultimo tuffo per levarci la sabbia attaccata alla pelle e ritornavamo a casa che il sole era già calato, all'ora di cena. Quando faceva buio noi ragazzi ci mandavano a fare granchi, con la luce, che serviva per mettere l'esca agli ami per pescare. Ne raccoglievamo in quantità poi in casa li mettevamo in un sacchetto chiuso in cucina. Una mattina in cui ci eravamo alzati che era ancora buio, quando siamo andati a prendere il sacchetto era vuoto e i granchi giravano per tutte le camere e c'è voluta più di mezz'ora per raccoglierli tutti.

'''Dada''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|d|ɑː|d|ɑː}}) or '''Dadaism''' was an [[art movement]] of the European [[avant-garde]] in the early 20th century, with early centers in Zürich, Switzerland, at the [[Cabaret Voltaire (Zurich)|Cabaret Voltaire]] (circa 1916); [[New York Dada]] began circa 1915,&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.fr/books?id=SF5QAAAAMAAJ Francis M. Naumann, ''New York Dada, 1915-23''], Abrams, 1994, {{ISBN|0810936763}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mario de Micheli (2006). ''Las vanguardias artísticas del siglo XX.'' Alianza Forma. p.135-137&lt;/ref&gt; and after 1920 Dada flourished in Paris.  Developed in reaction to [[World War I]], the Dada movement consisted of artists who rejected the [[logic]], [[reason]], and [[aestheticism]] of modern [[capitalist society]], instead expressing [[nonsense]], [[irrationality]], and [[anti-bourgeois]] protest in their works.&lt;ref name="smith"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Trachtman|first1=Paul|title=A Brief History of Dada|url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/arts-culture/dada-115169154/|website=Smithsonian Magazine|accessdate=14 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Schneede"&gt;{{Citation | last=Schneede | first=Uwe M. | year=1979 | title=George Grosz, His life and work | location = New York | publisher = Universe Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Budd"&gt;Budd, Dona, ''The Language of Art Knowledge'', Pomegranate Communications, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt; The art of the movement spanned visual, literary, and sound media, including [[collage]], [[sound poetry]], [[cut-up technique|cut-up writing]], and sculpture. Dadaist artists expressed their discontent with violence, war, and nationalism, and maintained political affinities with the [[Far-left politics|radical left]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tate.org.uk/learn/online-resources/glossary/d/dada Dada, Tate]&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Dada1.jpg|thumb|Cover of the first edition of the publication ''Dada'' by [[Tristan Tzara]]; Zürich, 1917]]

There is no consensus on the origin of the movement's name; a common story is that the German artist [[Richard Huelsenbeck]] slid a [[paper knife]] (letter-opener) at random into a dictionary, where it landed on "dada", a colloquial French term for a [[Hobby horse (toy)|hobby horse]]. Others note that it suggests the first words of a child, evoking a childishness and absurdity that appealed to the group. Still others speculate that the word might have been chosen to evoke a similar meaning (or no meaning at all) in any language, reflecting the movement's internationalism.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theartstory.org/movement-dada.htm ''Dada''] at thearthistory.org, retrieved March 13, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

The roots of Dada lie in pre-war avant-garde. The term [[anti-art]], a precursor to Dada, was coined by [[Marcel Duchamp]] around 1913 to characterize works which challenge accepted definitions of art.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tate.org.uk/learn/online-resources/glossary/a/anti-art Anti-art, Art that challenges the existing accepted definitions of art, Tate]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cubism]] and the development of [[collage]] and [[abstract art]] would inform the movement's detachment from the constraints of reality and convention. The work of French poets, Italian [[Futurism|Futurists]] and the [[Expressionism|German Expressionists]] would influence Dada's rejection of the tight correlation between words and meaning.&lt;ref name=oxfordart&gt;[http://www.oxfordartonline.com/groveart/view/10.1093/gao/9781884446054.001.0001/oao-9781884446054-e-7000021094?&amp;mediaType=Article "Dada"], by [[Dawn Adès]] and Matthew Gale, ''[[Grove Art Online]]'', Oxford University Press, 2009 {{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt; Works such as ''[[Ubu Roi]]'' (1896) by [[Alfred Jarry]], and the ballet [[Parade (ballet)|''Parade'']] (1916–17) by [[Erik Satie]] would also be characterized as proto-Dadaist works.&lt;ref&gt;Roselee Goldberg, Thomas &amp; Hudson, ''L'univers de l'art'',  Chapter 4, ''Le surréalisme'', ''Les représentations pré-Dada à Paris'', {{ISBN|978-2-87811-380-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Dada movement's principles were first collected in [[Hugo Ball]]'s [[wikisource:Dada Manifesto (1916, Hugo Ball)|Dada Manifesto]] in 1916.

The Dadaist movement included public gatherings, demonstrations, and publication of art/[[literary journals]]; passionate coverage of art, politics, and culture were topics often discussed in a variety of media. Key figures in the movement included [[Hugo Ball]], [[Marcel Duchamp]], [[Emmy Hennings]], [[Hans Arp]], [[Sophie Taeuber-Arp]], [[Raoul Hausmann]], [[Hannah Höch]], [[Johannes Baader]], [[Tristan Tzara]], [[Francis Picabia]], Huelsenbeck, [[George Grosz]], [[John Heartfield]], [[Man Ray]], [[Beatrice Wood]], [[Kurt Schwitters]], [[Hans Richter (artist)|Hans Richter]], [[Max Ernst]], and [[Elsa von Freytag-Loringhoven]] among others. The movement influenced later styles like the avant-garde and [[downtown music]] movements, and groups including [[Surrealism]], ''[[nouveau réalisme]]'', [[pop art]] and [[Fluxus]].

==Overview==
[[File:Francis Picabia, Dame! Illustration for the cover of the periodical Dadaphone n. 7, Paris, March 1920.jpg|thumb|[[Francis Picabia]], ''Dame!'' Illustration for the cover of the periodical ''Dadaphone'', n. 7, Paris, March 1920]]
Dada was an informal international movement, with participants in Europe and North America. The beginnings of Dada correspond to the outbreak of World War I. For many participants, the movement was a protest against the [[bourgeoisie|bourgeois]] [[nationalism|nationalist]] and [[colonialism|colonialist]] interests, which many Dadaists believed were the root cause of the war, and against the cultural and intellectual conformity—in art and more broadly in society—that corresponded to the war.&lt;ref name=RichterAntiArt&gt;{{Citation | last=Richter | first=Hans | year=1965 | title=Dada: Art and Anti-art | location= New York and Toronto | publisher = Oxford University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Avant-garde circles outside France knew of pre-war Parisian developments. They had seen (or participated in) Cubist exhibitions held at [[Galeries Dalmau]], Barcelona (1912), Galerie [[Der Sturm]] in Berlin (1912), the [[Armory Show]] in New York (1913), [[Mánes Union of Fine Arts|SVU Mánes]] in Prague (1914), several [[Jack of Diamonds (artists)|Jack of Diamonds]] exhibitions in Moscow and at De Moderne Kunstkring, Amsterdam (between 1911 and 1915). [[Futurism]] developed in response to the work of various artists. Dada subsequently combined these approaches.&lt;ref name=oxfordart /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=sPGdBxzaWj0C&amp;pg=RA1-PA6&amp;lpg=RA1-PA6&amp;dq=%22Barcelona+and+developments+in+Zurich%22,+1916%E2%80%9320&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=qbkgGKzLti&amp;sig=WSVSo0NVM_bSoiKAaOMb-e-ez_E&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjS_IGtzcHRAhUMaxQKHdWzBGwQ6AEIJTAC#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Barcelona%20and%20developments%20in%20Zurich%22%2C%201916%E2%80%9320&amp;f=false Joan M. Marter, ''The Grove Encyclopedia of American Art, Volume 1'', Oxford University Press, 2011], p. 6, {{ISBN|0195335791}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many Dadaists believed that the 'reason' and 'logic' of bourgeois [[capitalism|capitalist]] society had led people into war. They expressed their rejection of that ideology in artistic expression that appeared to reject logic and embrace [[Randomness|chaos]] and [[irrationality]].&lt;ref name="Schneede"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Budd"/&gt; For example, [[George Grosz]] later recalled that his Dadaist art was intended as a protest "against this world of mutual destruction."&lt;ref name="Schneede" /&gt;

According to [[Hans Richter (artist)|Hans Richter]] Dada was not art: it was "[[anti-art]]."&lt;ref name=RichterAntiArt /&gt;  Dada represented the opposite of everything which art stood for. Where art was concerned with traditional [[aesthetics]], Dada ignored aesthetics. If art was to appeal to sensibilities, Dada was intended to offend.

As [[Hugo Ball]] expressed it, "For us, art is not an end in itself ... but it is an opportunity for the true perception and criticism of the times we live in."&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title=DADA: Cities | url=http://www.nga.gov/exhibitions/2006/dada/cities/index.shtm | publisher=[[National Gallery of Art]] | accessdate=2008-10-19 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081102003737/http://www.nga.gov/exhibitions/2006/dada/cities/index.shtm | archive-date=2008-11-02 | dead-url=yes | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A reviewer from the ''[[ARTnews|American Art News]]'' stated at the time that "Dada philosophy is the sickest, most paralyzing and most destructive thing that has ever originated from the brain of man." Art historians have described Dada as being, in large part, a "reaction to what many of these artists saw as nothing more than an insane spectacle of collective homicide."&lt;ref name="gardners"&gt;{{Citation | author = Fred S. Kleiner | title = Gardner's Art Through the Ages | edition = 12th | year = 2006 | publisher = Wadsworth Publishing | page = 754}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Years later, Dada artists described the movement as "a phenomenon bursting forth in the midst of the postwar economic and moral crisis, a savior, a monster, which would lay waste to everything in its path... [It was] a systematic work of destruction and demoralization... In the end it became nothing but an act of sacrilege."&lt;ref name="gardners"/&gt;

To quote Dona Budd's ''The Language of Art Knowledge'', &lt;blockquote&gt;Dada was born out of negative reaction to the horrors of the First World War. This international movement was begun by a group of artists and poets associated with the [[Cabaret Voltaire (Zurich)|Cabaret Voltaire]] in Zürich. Dada rejected reason and logic, prizing nonsense, irrationality and intuition. The origin of the name Dada is unclear; some believe that it is a nonsensical word. Others maintain that it originates from the Romanian artists Tristan Tzara's and Marcel Janco's frequent use of the words "da, da," meaning "yes, yes" in the Romanian language. Another theory says that the name "Dada" came during a meeting of the group when a [[paper knife]] stuck into a French–German dictionary happened to point to 'dada', a French word for '[[Hobby horse (toy)|hobbyhorse]]'.&lt;ref name="Budd" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; The movement primarily involved [[visual arts]], [[literature]], [[poetry]], [[art manifesto]]s, [[aesthetics|art theory]], [[theatre]], and [[graphic design]], and concentrated its [[anti-war]] politics through a rejection of the prevailing standards in [[art]] through anti-art cultural works.

The creations of Duchamp, Picabia, Man Ray, and others between 1915 and 1917 eluded the term Dada at the time, and "[[New York Dada]]" came to be seen as a post facto invention of Duchamp. At the outset of the 1920s the term Dada flourished in Europe with the help of Duchamp and Picabia, who had both returned from New York. Notwithstanding, Dadaists such as Tzara and Richter claimed European precedence. Art historian David Hopkins notes:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Ironically, though, Duchamp's late activities in New York, along with the machinations of Picabia, re-cast Dada's history. Dada's European chroniclers—primarily Richter, Tzara, and Huelsenbeck—would eventually become preoccupied with establishing the pre-eminence of Zurich and Berlin at the foundations of Dada, but it proved to be Duchamp who was most strategically brilliant in manipulating the genealogy of this avant-garde formation, deftly turning New York Dada from a late-comer into an originating force.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.fr/books?isbn=1118476182 Hopkins, David, ''A Companion to Dada and Surrealism''], Volume 10 of Blackwell Companions to Art History, John Wiley &amp; Sons, May 2, 2016, p. 83, ISBN 11184761828&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==History==

===Zürich===
[[File:Hoch-Cut With the Kitchen Knife.jpg|thumb|left|[[Hannah Höch]], ''Cut with the Dada Kitchen Knife through the Last Weimar Beer-Belly Cultural Epoch in Germany'', 1919, collage of pasted papers, 90×144&amp;nbsp;cm, [[Berlin State Museums|Nationalgalerie, Staatliche Museen zu Berlin]]]]
In 1916, [[Hugo Ball]], [[Emmy Hennings]], [[Tristan Tzara]], [[Jean Arp]], [[Marcel Janco]], [[Richard Huelsenbeck]], [[Sophie Taeuber]], and [[Hans Richter (artist)|Hans Richter]], along with others, discussed art and put on performances in the [[Cabaret Voltaire (Zürich)|Cabaret Voltaire]] expressing their disgust with the war and the interests that inspired it.

Some sources state that Dada coalesced on October&amp;nbsp;6 at the Cabaret Voltaire. Other sources state that Dada did not originate fully in a Zürich literary salon but grew out of an already vibrant artistic tradition in Eastern Europe, particularly Romania, that transposed to Switzerland when a group of Jewish [[Modernism|modernist]] artists (Tzara, Janco, [[Arthur Segal (painter)|Arthur Segal]], and others) settled in Zürich. In the years prior to the First World War similar art had already risen in Bucharest and other Eastern European cities; it is likely that Dada's catalyst was the arrival in Zürich of artists like Tzara and Janco.&lt;ref&gt;Tom Sandqvist, ''DADA EAST: The Romanians of Cabaret Voltaire'', London MIT Press, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

Having left Germany and Romania during the Great War, the artists found themselves in Switzerland, a country recognized for its neutrality. Inside this space of political neutrality they decided to use abstraction to fight against the social, political, and cultural ideas of that time. The Dadaists believed those ideas to be a byproduct of bourgeois society, a society so apathetic it would rather fight a war against itself than challenge the ''[[status quo]]''.&lt;ref name="nga.gov"&gt;{{cite web|title=Introduction: "Everybody can Dada"|url=http://www.nga.gov/exhibitions/2006/dada/cities/index.shtm|publisher=[[National Gallery of Art]]|accessdate=10 May 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081102003737/http://www.nga.gov/exhibitions/2006/dada/cities/index.shtm|archive-date=2 November 2008|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Janco recalled, "We had lost confidence in our culture. Everything had to be demolished. We would begin again after the ''[[tabula rasa]]''. At the Cabaret Voltaire we began by shocking common sense, public opinion, education, institutions, museums, good taste, in short, the whole prevailing order." &lt;ref&gt;Marcel Janco, "Dada at Two Speeds," trans. in Lucy R. Lippard, Dadas on Art (Englewood Cliffs, N.J., 1971), p. 36.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Cabaret closed its doors in early July and then at the first public [[soirée]] at Waag Hall&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dada-companion.com/cabaret/ |title=Cabaret Voltaire |publisher=DADA Companion |date= |accessdate=2011-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; on July 14, 1916, Ball recited the [[wikisource:Dada Manifesto (1916, Hugo Ball)|first manifesto]]. In 1917, Tzara wrote a second [[wikisource:Dada Manifesto|Dada manifesto]] considered one of the most important Dada writings, which was published in 1918. Other manifestos followed.

A single issue of the magazine ''Cabaret Voltaire'' was the first publication to come out of the movement.

After the cabaret closed down, Dada activities moved on to a new gallery, and [[Hugo Ball]] left for Bern. Tzara began a relentless campaign to spread Dada ideas. He bombarded French and Italian artists and writers with letters, and soon emerged as the Dada leader and master strategist. The Cabaret Voltaire re-opened, and is still in the same place at the Spiegelgasse 1 in the Niederdorf.

Zürich Dada, with Tzara at the helm, published the art and literature review ''Dada'' beginning in July 1917, with five editions from Zürich and the final two from Paris.

Other artists, such as [[André Breton]] and [[Philippe Soupault]], created “literature groups to help extend the influence of Dada.”&lt;ref&gt;Europe of Cultures. [http://fresques.ina.fr/europe-des-cultures-en/fiche-media/Europe00022/tristan-tzara-speaks-about-the-dada-movement.html "Tristan Tzara speaks of the Dada Movement."], September 6, 1963. Retrieved on July 2, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

After the fighting of the First World War had ended in the armistice of November 1918, most of the Zürich Dadaists returned to their home countries, and some began Dada activities in other cities. Others, such as the Swiss native [[Sophie Taeuber]], would remain in Zürich into the 1920s.

===Berlin===
[[File:An Anna Blume.jpg|thumb|Cover of ''Anna Blume, Dichtungen'', 1919]]
"Berlin was a city of tightened stomachers, of mounting, thundering hunger, where hidden rage was transformed into a boundless money lust, and men's minds were concentrating more and more on questions of naked existence... Fear was in everybody's bones "- Richard Hülsenbeck

The groups in Germany were not as strongly [[anti-art]] as other groups. Their activity and art were more political and social, with corrosive [[art manifesto|manifestos]] and propaganda, satire, public demonstrations and overt political activities. The intensely political and war-torn environment of Berlin had a dramatic impact on the ideas of Berlin Dadaists. Conversely, New York's geographic distance from the war spawned its more theoretically-driven, less political nature.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = New York Dada|last = Naumann|first = Francis M.|publisher = Abrams|year = 1994|isbn = 0810936763|location = New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 1918, while the Great War was approaching its climax, Huelsenbeck gave his first Dada speech in Berlin, and he produced a Dada manifesto later in the year. Following the [[October Revolution]] in [[Russian Empire|Russia]], by then out of the war, [[Hannah Höch]] and [[George Grosz]] used Dada to express communist sympathies. Grosz, together with [[John Heartfield]], Höch and Hausmann developed the [[wikt:technique|technique]] of [[photomontage]] during this period.

After the war, the artists published a series of short-lived political magazines and held the ''First International Dada Fair'', 'the greatest project yet conceived by the Berlin Dadaists', in the summer of 1920.&lt;ref name="Dada, Dickermann p443"&gt;Dada, Dickermann, National Gallery of Art, Washington, 2006 p443&lt;/ref&gt; As well as work by the main members of Berlin Dada – Grosz, [[Raoul Hausmann]], Hannah Höch, [[Johannes Baader]], Huelsenbeck and Heartfield – the exhibition also included the work of [[Otto Dix]], [[Francis Picabia]], Jean Arp, [[Max Ernst]], [[Rudolf Schlichter]], [[Johannes Theodor Baargeld|Johannes Baargeld]] and others.&lt;ref name="Dada, Dickermann p443"/&gt; In all, over 200 works were exhibited, surrounded by incendiary slogans, some of which also ended up written on the walls of the Nazi's ''[[Entartete Kunst]]'' exhibition in 1937. Despite high ticket prices, the exhibition lost money, with only one recorded sale.&lt;ref&gt;Dada, Dickermann, National Gallery of Art, Washington, 2006 p99&lt;/ref&gt;

The Berlin group published periodicals such as ''Club Dada'', ''Der Dada'', ''[[Jedermann sein eigner Fussball|Everyman His Own Football]]'', and ''Dada Almanach''.

===Cologne===
In [[Cologne]], Ernst, Baargeld, and Arp launched a controversial Dada exhibition in 1920 which focused on nonsense and anti-bourgeois sentiments. Cologne's Early Spring Exhibition was set up in a pub, and required that participants walk past urinals while being read lewd poetry by a woman in a [[Eucharist|communion]] dress. The police closed the exhibition on grounds of obscenity, but it was re-opened when the charges were dropped.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

===New York===
{{main|New York Dada}}
Like Zürich, New York City was a refuge for writers and artists from the First World War. Soon after arriving from France in 1915, [[Marcel Duchamp]] and [[Francis Picabia]] met American artist [[Man Ray]]. By 1916 the three of them became the center of radical [[anti-art]] activities in the United States. American [[Beatrice Wood]], who had been studying in France, soon joined them, along with [[Elsa von Freytag-Loringhoven]]. [[Arthur Cravan]], fleeing conscription in France, was also in New York for a time. Much of their activity centered in [[Alfred Stieglitz]]'s gallery, [[291 (art gallery)|291]], and the home of [[Walter Conrad Arensberg|Walter and Louise Arensberg]].

The New Yorkers, though not particularly organized, called their activities ''Dada,'' but they did not issue manifestos. They issued challenges to art and culture through publications such as ''[[The Blind Man]]'', ''Rongwrong'', and ''New York Dada'' in which they criticized the traditionalist basis for ''museum'' art. New York Dada lacked the disillusionment of European Dada and was instead driven by a sense of irony and humor. In his book ''Adventures in the arts: informal chapters on painters, vaudeville and poets'' [[Marsden Hartley]] included an essay on "[[s:The Importance of Being Dada|The Importance of Being 'Dada']]".

[[File:Label for the Belle Haleine cropped.png|thumb|upright|[[Rrose Sélavy]], the alter ego of Dadaist [[Marcel Duchamp]]]]
During this time Duchamp began exhibiting "[[Readymades of Marcel Duchamp|readymades]]" (everyday objects found or purchased and declared art) such as a bottle rack, and was active in the [[Society of Independent Artists]]. In 1917 he submitted the now famous ''[[Fountain (Duchamp)|Fountain]]'', a urinal signed R.&amp;nbsp;Mutt, to the Society of Independent Artists exhibition but they rejected the piece. First an object of scorn within the arts community, the ''Fountain'' has since become almost canonized by some&lt;ref name="Independent"&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/this-britain/fountain-most-influential-piece-of-modern-art-673625.html, ''Fountain' most influential piece of modern art''], Independent, December 2, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; as one of the most recognizable modernist works of sculpture. Art world experts polled by the sponsors of the 2004 [[Turner Prize]], Gordon's gin, voted it "the most influential work of modern art".&lt;ref name="Independent" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/4059997.stm "Duchamp's urinal tops art survey"], [[BBC News]] December&amp;nbsp;1, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; As recent scholarship documents, the work is still controversial. Duchamp indicated in a 1917 letter to his sister that a female friend was centrally involved in the conception of this work: "One of my female friends who had adopted the pseudonym Richard Mutt sent me a porcelain urinal as a sculpture."&lt;ref&gt;Duchamp, Marcel trans. and qtd. in [[Irene Gammel|Gammel, Irene]]. ''Baroness Elsa: Gender, Dada and Everyday Modernity.'' Cambridge, Massachusetts: MIT Press, 2002, 224.&lt;/ref&gt; The piece is in line with the scatological aesthetics of Duchamp's neighbour, the [[Elsa von Freytag-Loringhoven|Baroness Elsa von Freytag-Loringhoven]].&lt;ref&gt;Gammel, ''Baroness Elsa'', 224–225.&lt;/ref&gt; In an attempt to "pay homage to the spirit of Dada" a performance artist named [[Pierre Pinoncelli]] made a crack in a replica of ''The Fountain'' with a hammer in January 2006; he also urinated on it in 1993.

Picabia's travels tied New York, Zürich and Paris groups together during the Dadaist period. For seven years he also published the Dada periodical ''[[391 (magazine)|391]]'' in Barcelona, New York City, Zürich, and Paris from 1917 through 1924.

By 1921, most of the original players moved to Paris where Dada had experienced its last major incarnation.

===Paris===
[[File:Man Ray, Rencontre dans la porte tournante.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Man Ray]], c. 1921–22, ''Rencontre dans la porte tournante'', published on the cover of ''[[Der Sturm]]'', Volume 13, Number 3, 5 March 1922]]
[[File:Man Ray, Dessin.jpg|thumb|upright|Man Ray, c. 1921–22, ''Dessin'' (''Drawing''), published on page 43 of ''Der Sturm'', Volume 13, Number 3, 5 March 1922]]
The French [[avant-garde]] kept abreast of Dada activities in Zürich with regular communications from [[Tristan Tzara]] (whose pseudonym means "sad in country," a name chosen to protest the treatment of Jews in his native Romania), who exchanged letters, poems, and magazines with [[Guillaume Apollinaire]], [[André Breton]], [[Max Jacob]], [[Clément Pansaers]], and other French writers, critics and artists.

Paris had arguably been the classical music capital of the world since the advent of musical Impressionism in the late 19th century. One of its practitioners, [[Erik Satie]], collaborated with [[Pablo Picasso|Picasso]] and [[Jean Cocteau|Cocteau]] in a mad, scandalous ballet called ''[[Parade (ballet)|Parade]]''. First performed by the [[Ballets Russes]] in 1917, it succeeded in creating a scandal but in a different way than Stravinsky's ''[[Le Sacre du printemps]]'' had done almost five years earlier. This was a ballet that was clearly parodying itself, something traditional ballet patrons would obviously have serious issues with.

Dada in Paris surged in 1920 when many of the originators converged there. Inspired by Tzara, Paris Dada soon issued manifestos, organized demonstrations, staged performances and produced a number of journals (the final two editions of ''Dada'', ''Le Cannibale'', and ''Littérature'' featured Dada in several editions.)&lt;ref&gt;Marc Dachy, {{lang|fr|Dada : La révolte de l'art}}, Paris, Gallimard / Centre Pompidou, collection "[[Découvertes Gallimard]]" (nº 476), 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first introduction of Dada artwork to the Parisian public was at the ''[[Salon des Indépendants]]'' in 1921. [[Jean Crotti]] exhibited works associated with Dada including a work entitled, ''Explicatif''  bearing the word ''Tabu''. In the same year Tzara staged his Dadaist play ''[[The Gas Heart]]'' to howls of derision from the audience. When it was re-staged in 1923 in a more professional production, the play provoked a theatre riot (initiated by [[André Breton]]) that heralded the split within the movement that was to produce [[Surrealism]]. Tzara's last attempt at a Dadaist drama was his "[[Irony|ironic]] [[tragedy]]" ''[[Handkerchief of Clouds]]'' in 1924.

===Netherlands===
In the Netherlands the Dada movement centered mainly around [[Theo van Doesburg]], best known for establishing the [[De Stijl]] movement and magazine of the same name. Van Doesburg mainly focused on poetry, and included poems from many well-known Dada writers in ''De Stijl'' such as [[Hugo Ball]], [[Hans Arp]] and [[Kurt Schwitters]]. Van Doesburg and {{Interlanguage link multi|Thijs Rinsema|nl}} (a [[cordwainer]] and artist in [[Drachten]]) became friends of Schwitters, and together they organized the so-called ''Dutch Dada campaign'' in 1923, where van Doesburg promoted a leaflet about Dada (entitled ''What is Dada?''), Schwitters read his poems, [[Vilmos Huszár]] demonstrated a mechanical dancing doll and Nelly van Doesburg (Theo's wife), played [[avant-garde]] compositions on piano.

[[File:I.K. Bonset Voorbijtrekkende troep 2.jpg|thumb|A Bonset sound-poem, "Passing troop", 1916]]
Van Doesburg wrote Dada poetry himself in ''De Stijl'', although under a pseudonym, I.K.&amp;nbsp;Bonset, which was only revealed after his death in 1931. 'Together' with I.K.&amp;nbsp;Bonset, he also published a short-lived [[Dutch literature|Dutch]] Dada magazine called ''Mécano'' (1922–3). Another Dutchman identified by [[K. Schippers]] in his study of the movement in the Netherlands&lt;ref&gt;''Holland Dada'', Amsterdam, 1974&lt;/ref&gt; was the [[Groningen]] typographer [[H. N. Werkman]], who was in touch with van Doesburg and Schwitters while editing his own magazine, ''The Next Call'' (1923–6). Two more artists mentioned by Schippers were German-born and eventually settled in the Netherlands. These were Otto van Rees, who had taken part in the liminal exhibitions at the Café Voltaire in Zürich, and [[Paul Citroen]].

===Georgia===
Although Dada itself was unknown in [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] until at least 1920, from 1917 until 1921 a group of poets called themselves "41st Degree" (referring both to the latitude of [[Tbilisi]], Georgia and to the temperature of a high fever) organized  along Dadaist lines. The most important figure in this group was [[Ilia Zdanevich|Iliazd]], whose radical typographical designs visually echo the publications of the Dadaists. After his flight to Paris in 1921, he collaborated with Dadaists on publications and events.

===Yugoslavia===
In [[Yugoslavia]] there was significant Dada activity between 1920 and 1922, run mainly by [[Dragan Aleksić]] and including work by Mihailo S.&amp;nbsp;Petrov, [[Zenitism]]'s two brothers Ljubomir Micić and Branko Ve Poljanski.&lt;ref&gt;[https://monoskop.org/Zenit ''Zenit: International Review of Arts and Culture'']&lt;/ref&gt; Aleksić used the term "Yougo-Dada" and is known to have been in contact with [[Raoul Hausmann]], [[Kurt Schwitters]], and [[Tristan Tzara]].&lt;ref&gt;Dubravka Djurić, Miško Šuvaković.

===Italy===
The Dada movement in Italy, based in [[Mantua]], was met with distaste and failed to make a significant impact in the world of art. It published a magazine for a short time and held an exhibition in Rome, featuring paintings, quotations from Tristan Tzara, and original epigrams such as "True Dada is against Dada". The most notable member of this group was [[Julius Evola]], who went on to become an eminent scholar of [[occultism]], as well as a right-wing philosopher and an assistant to [[Benito Mussolini]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://sdrc.lib.uiowa.edu/dada/dadas/evola.htm Julius Evola – International Dada Archive]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Japan===
[[File:Dada in Ultraman.jpg|thumb|Dada, an iconic character from the Ultra Series. His design draws inspiration from the art movement.]]
A prominent Dada group in Japan was [[Mavo]], founded in July 1923 by [[Tomoyoshi Murayama]] and {{ill|Yanase Masamu|de||ja|柳瀬正夢}}. Other prominent artists were [[Jun Tsuji]], [[Eisuke Yoshiyuki]], [[Shinkichi Takahashi]] and [[Katsue Kitasono]].

In the [[Tsuburaya Productions]]'s ''[[Ultra Series]]'', an alien named Dada was designed after the Dadaism movement, with said character first appearing in episode 28 of the 1966 [[tokusatsu]] series, ''[[Ultraman]]'', and was designed by character artist [[Toru Narita]]. Dada's design is primarily monochromatic, and features numerous sharp lines and alternating black and white stripes, as a reference to the movement. On May 19, 2016, in celebration to the 100 year anniversary of Dadaism in Tokyo, the Ultra Monster was invited to meet the Swiss Ambassador Urs Bucher.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://m-78.jp/news/n-3812/|title=「三面怪人 ダダ」が「ダダイズム100周年」を祝福！スイス大使館で開催された記者発表会に登場！|publisher=m-78.jp|language=ja|date=2016-05-19|accessdate=2016-06-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tokusatsunetwork.com/2016/05/dada-celebrates-dadaisms-birthday/|title=Dada Celebrates Dadaism’s 100th Anniversary|publisher=tokusatsunetwork.com|date=2016-05-19|accessdate=2016-06-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Russia===
{{unreferenced section|date=October 2017}}
Dada in itself was relatively unknown in Russia, however, avant-garde art was widespread due to the [[Bolshevik]]'s revolutionary agenda. The {{ill|Nichevoki|ru|Ничевоки}}, a literary group sharing Dadaist ideals achieved infamy after one of its members suggested that [[Vladimir Mayakovsky]] should go to the "Pampushka" (Pameatnik Pushkina – [[Pushkinskaya Square|Pushkin monument]]) on the "Tverbul" ([[Tverskoy Boulevard]]) to clean the shoes of anyone who desired it, after Mayakovsky declared that he was going to cleanse Russian literature.

==Poetry, music and sound==
In literature, Dadaism focused mainly on poetry, particularly the so-called sound poetry, which was invented by [[Hugo Ball]] and often performed on stage. The Dadaist poem is described as one that abolishes the traditional concept of poetry, including the structure, order, as well as the interplay of sound and meaning or the meaning of language itself. The belief is that the existing system by which information is articulated is said to rob language of its dignity. 

[[File:Dadaglobe Form Letter to Vagts (Nov 1920).jpg|thumb|Dadaglobe solicitation form letter signed by Francis Picabia, Tristan Tzara, Georges Ribemont-Dessaignes, and Walter Serner, c. week of November 8, 1920. This example was sent from Paris to Alfred Vagts in Munich.]]

Therefore, the dismantling of the language and the poetic conventions are considered attempts to restore language to its purest and most innocent form. "With these sound poem, we wanted to dispense with a language which journalism had made desolate and impossible."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Dadaism|last=Elger|first=Dietmar|last2=Grosenick|first2=Uta|publisher=Taschen|year=2004|isbn=9783822829462|location=London|pages=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the offshoots of this type of poetry was the simultaneous poems, which were recited by a group of speakers, who collectively produce a chaotic and confusing set of voices. The poems are considered manifestations of modern society such as advertising, technology, and conflict, among others. However, unlike movements such as expressionism, Dadaism appreciated the dynamics of modernity and the urban life. The poetry produced by this genre does not consider the chaotic urban and futuristic world as negative, man-eating or hellish. Instead, there is a focus on how these serve as new natural terrain that opens up new ideas for life and art.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Text Into Image, Image Into Text: Proceedings of the Interdisciplinary|last=Morrison|first=Jeffrey|last2=Krobb|first2=Florian|publisher=Rodopi|year=1997|isbn=9042001526|location=Atlanta|pages=234}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Dadaism also blurred the line between the literary and visual arts. One of the Dadaist techniques, for instance, proposed the use of physical materials alongside words so that the newly created poem became a fruit of the written idea and the physical artifacts such as newspapers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Brazilian Literature as World Literature|last=Coutinho|first=Eduardo|publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing|year=2018|isbn=9781501323263|location=New York|pages=158}}&lt;/ref&gt; Marc Lowenthal, in ''I Am a Beautiful Monster: Poetry, Prose, and Provocation'', writes:&lt;blockquote&gt;Dada is the groundwork to abstract art and sound poetry, a starting point for performance art, a prelude to [[postmodernism]], an influence on [[pop art]], a celebration of antiart to be later embraced for anarcho-political uses in the 1960s and the movement that laid the foundation for [[Surrealism]].&lt;ref&gt;Marc Lowenthal, translator's introduction to [[Francis Picabia]]'s ''I Am a Beautiful Monster: Poetry, Prose, and Provocation''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Dada was not confined to the visual and literary arts; its influence reached into sound and music. [[Kurt Schwitters]] developed what he called ''[[Sound poetry|sound poems]]'', while [[Francis Picabia]] and [[Georges Ribemont-Dessaignes]] composed Dada music performed at the Festival Dada in Paris on 26 May 1920. Other composers such as [[Erwin Schulhoff]], Hans Heusser and [[Alberto Savinio]] all wrote ''Dada music'', while members of [[Les Six]] collaborated with members of the Dada movement and had their works performed at Dada gatherings. [[Erik Satie]] also dabbled with Dadaist ideas during his career, although he is primarily associated with musical [[Impressionism]].

In the very first Dada publication, Hugo Ball describes a "balalaika orchestra playing delightful folk-songs." [[African music]] and jazz were common at Dada gatherings.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}

Musician [[Frank Zappa]] was a self-proclaimed Dadaist after learning of the movement:&lt;blockquote&gt;In the early days, I didn't even know what to call the stuff my life was made of. You can imagine my delight when I discovered that someone in a distant land had the same idea—AND a nice, short name for it.&lt;ref&gt;Frank Zappa, ''The Real Frank Zappa Book'', p. 162&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Legacy==
[[File:En hod dada museum.jpg|thumb|The [[Janco Dada Museum]], named after [[Marcel Janco]], in [[Ein Hod]], Israel]]
While broadly based, the movement was unstable. By 1924 in Paris, Dada was melding into Surrealism, and artists had gone on to other ideas and movements, including Surrealism, [[social realism]] and other forms of [[modernism]]. Some theorists argue that Dada was actually the beginning of [[postmodern art]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation| last=Locher| first=David| title=Unacknowledged Roots and Blatant Imitation: Postmodernism and the Dada Movement| journal=Electronic Journal of Sociology| volume=4| issue=1| year=1999| url=http://www.sociology.org/content/vol004.001/locher.html| accessdate=2007-04-25| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070223045916/http://www.sociology.org/content/vol004.001/locher.html| archive-date=2007-02-23| dead-url=yes| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the dawn of the [[World War II|Second World War]], many of the European Dadaists had emigrated to the United States. Some ([[Otto Freundlich]], [[Walter Serner]]) died in death camps under [[Adolf Hitler]], who actively persecuted the kind of "[[degenerate art]]" that he considered Dada to represent. The movement became less active as post-war optimism led to the development of new movements in art and literature.

Dada is a named influence and reference of various [[anti-art]] and political and cultural movements, including the [[Situationist International]] and [[culture jamming]] groups like the [[Cacophony Society]]. Upon breaking up in July 2012, [[anarchist]] pop band [[Chumbawamba]] issued a statement which compared their own legacy with that of the Dada art movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Chumbawamba|url=http://www.chumba.com/|accessdate=10 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the same time that the Zürich Dadaists were making noise and spectacle at the [[Cabaret Voltaire (Zürich)|Cabaret Voltaire]], [[Vladimir Lenin|Lenin]] was planning his revolutionary plans for Russia in a nearby apartment. [[Tom Stoppard]] used this coincidence as a premise for his play ''[[Travesties]]'' (1974), which includes Tzara, Lenin, and [[James Joyce]] as characters. French writer Dominique Noguez imagined Lenin as a member of the Dada group in his tongue-in-cheek ''Lénine Dada'' (1989).

The former building of the Cabaret Voltaire fell into disrepair until it was occupied from January to March 2002, by a group proclaiming themselves [[Neo-Dada]]ists, led by [[Mark Divo]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.praguepost.com/articles/2006/11/01/a-work-in-process.php 2002 occupation by neo-Dadaists] ''Prague Post''&lt;/ref&gt; The group included [[Leumund Cult|Jan Thieler]], [[Ingo Giezendanner]], Aiana Calugar, [[Lennie Lee]], and Dan Jones. After their eviction, the space was turned into a museum dedicated to the history of Dada. The work of Lee and Jones remained on the walls of the new museum.

Several notable [[retrospective]]s have examined the influence of Dada upon art and society. In 1967, a large Dada retrospective was held in Paris. In 2006, the [[Museum of Modern Art]] in New York City mounted a Dada exhibition in partnership with the [[National Gallery of Art]] in Washington D.C. and the [[Centre Pompidou]] in Paris. The [[LTM Recordings|LTM]] label has released a large number of Dada-related sound recordings, including interviews with artists such as Tzara, Picabia, Schwitters, Arp, and Huelsenbeck, and musical repertoire including Satie, Ribemont-Dessaignes, Picabia, and Nelly van Doesburg.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ltmrecordings.com/fdrcat.html LTM Recordings]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Art techniques developed==

===Collage===
The Dadaists imitated the techniques developed during the cubist movement through the pasting of cut pieces of paper items, but extended their art to encompass items such as transportation tickets, maps, plastic wrappers, etc. to portray aspects of life, rather than representing objects viewed as still life.

===Cut-up technique===
[[Cut-up technique]] is an extension of collage to words themselves, [[Tristan Tzara]] describes this in the Dada Manifesto:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.391.org/manifestos/19201212tristantzara_dmonflabl.htm |title=manifestos: dada manifesto on feeble love and bitter love by tristan tzara, 12th december 1920 |publisher=391 |date=1920-12-12 |accessdate=2011-06-27}} {{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;poem style="margin-left: 2em;"&gt;
TO MAKE A DADAIST POEM
Take a newspaper.
Take some scissors.
Choose from this paper an article of the length you want to make your poem.
Cut out the article.
Next carefully cut out each of the words that makes up this article and put them all in a bag.
Shake gently.
Next take out each cutting one after the other.
Copy conscientiously in the order in which they left the bag.
The poem will resemble you.
And there you are – an infinitely original author of charming sensibility, even though unappreciated by the vulgar herd.
&lt;/poem&gt;

===Photomontage===
[[File:ABCD-Hausmann.jpg|thumb|upright|Raoul Hausmann, ''ABCD'' (self-portrait), a photomontage from 1923–24]]
The Dadaists – the "monteurs" (mechanics) – used scissors and glue rather than paintbrushes and paints to express their views of modern life through images presented by the media. A variation on the collage technique, photomontage utilized actual or reproductions of real photographs printed in the press. In Cologne, [[Max Ernst]] used images from the First World War to illustrate messages of the destruction of war.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nga.gov/exhibitions/2006/dada/techniques/index.shtm |title=DADA – Techniques – photomontage |publisher=Nga.gov |date= |accessdate=2011-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:MechanicalHead-Hausmann.jpg|thumb|upright|Raoul Hausmann, ''Mechanischer Kopf (Der Geist unserer Zeit)'' (Mechanical Head [The Spirit of Our Age]), c. 1920]]

===Assemblage===
The [[assemblage (art)|assemblage]]s were three-dimensional variations of the collage – the assembly of everyday objects to produce meaningful or meaningless (relative to the war) pieces of work including war objects and trash. Objects were nailed, screwed or fastened together in different fashions.  Assemblages could be seen in the round or could be hung on a wall.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nga.gov/exhibitions/2006/dada/techniques/assemblage.shtm |title=DADA – Techniques – assemblage |publisher=Nga.gov |date= |accessdate=2011-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Readymades===
[[Marcel Duchamp]] began to view the manufactured objects of his collection as objects of art, which he called "[[Readymades of Marcel Duchamp|readymades]]". He would add signatures and titles to some, converting them into artwork that he called "readymade aided" or "rectified readymades". Duchamp wrote: "One important characteristic was the short sentence which I occasionally inscribed on the 'readymade.' That sentence, instead of describing the object like a title, was meant to carry the mind of the spectator towards other regions more verbal. Sometimes I would add a graphic detail of presentation which in order to satisfy my craving for alliterations, would be called 'readymade aided.'"&lt;ref&gt;"The Writings of Marcel Duchamp" {{ISBN|0-306-80341-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; One such example of Duchamp's readymade works is the urinal that was turned onto its back, signed "R. Mutt", titled ''[[Fountain (Duchamp)|Fountain]]'', and submitted to the Society of Independent Artists exhibition that year, though it was not displayed.

'''Dominions''' were [[autonomy|semi-independent]] [[polity|polities]] under the [[The Crown|British Crown]], constituting the [[British Empire]], beginning with [[Canadian Confederation]] in 1867.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.m-w.com/dictionary/dominion ''Merriam Webster's Dictionary''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929152657/http://www.m-w.com/dictionary/dominion |date=29 September 2007 }} (based on Collegiate vol., 11th ed.) 2006.

The [[Balfour Declaration of 1926]] recognised the Dominions as "autonomous {{not a typo|Communities}} within the British Empire", and the 1931 [[Statute of Westminster 1931|Statute of Westminster]] confirmed their full legislative independence.

Earlier usage of ''dominion'' to refer to a particular territory dates to the 16th century and was used to describe [[Wales]] from 1535 to 1801 and [[Dominion of New England|New England]] between 1686 and 1689.

==Definition==
[[File:The-queens-dominions.jpg|right|thumb|upright=1.15|Map of the British Empire under [[Queen Victoria]] at the end of the nineteenth century. "Dominions" refers to all territories belonging to [[the Crown]].]]

A distinction must be made between a British "dominion" and British "Dominions". The use of a capital "D" when referring to the 'British Dominions' was required by the United Kingdom government in order to avoid confusion with the wider term "His Majesty's dominions" which referred to the British Empire as a whole.&lt;ref name="Mohr2013"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mohr|first=Thomas|year=2013|title=The Statute of Westminster, 1931: An Irish Perspective|journal=Law and History Review|volume=31|issue=04|pages=749–791: fn.25|issn=0738-2480|doi=10.1017/S073824801300045X|url=http://researchrepository.ucd.ie/bitstream/handle/10197/6057/PC_Minority_Article.pdf#page=9|format=PDF|accessdate=6 October 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161009111429/http://researchrepository.ucd.ie/bitstream/handle/10197/6057/PC_Minority_Article.pdf#page=9|archivedate=9 October 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

All territories forming part of the British Empire were British dominions but only some were British Dominions. At the time of the adoption of the Statute of Westminster, there were six British Dominions: Canada, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, Newfoundland, and the Irish Free State. At the same time there were many other jurisdictions that were British dominions, for example Cyprus. The [[Order in Council]] annexing the island of [[Cyprus]] in 1914 declared that, from 5 November, the island "shall be annexed to and form part of His Majesty's dominions".&lt;ref&gt;''Cyprus (Annexation) Order in Council, 1914'', dated 5 November 1914.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Order quoted in ''The American Journal of International Law'', "Annexation of Cyprus by Great Britain"[https://archive.org/stream/jstor-2186866/2186866_djvu.txt]&lt;/ref&gt;

Use of ''dominion'' to refer to a particular territory dates back to the 16th century and was sometimes used to describe [[Wales]] from 1535 to around 1800: for instance, the [[Laws in Wales Act 1535]] applies to "the Dominion, Principality and Country of Wales".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1934/nov/05/wales-title-of-dominion |title=Parliamentary questions, Hansard, 5 November 1934 |publisher=hansard.millbanksystems.com |date=5 November 1934 |accessdate=11 June 2010 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090713164727/http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1934/nov/05/wales-title-of-dominion |archivedate=13 July 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Dominion'', as an official title, was conferred on the [[Colony of Virginia]] about 1660 and on the [[Dominion of New England]] in 1686. These dominions never had full self-governing status. The creation of the short-lived Dominion of New England was designed—contrary to the purpose of later dominions—to increase royal control and to reduce the colony's self-government.

Under the [[Constitution Act, 1867|British North America Act 1867]], Canada received the status of "Dominion" upon the [[Canadian Confederation|Confederation]] of [[British North America|several British possessions]] in [[North America]]. However, it was at the [[Imperial Conference|Colonial Conference of 1907]] when the self-governing colonies of Canada and the [[Commonwealth of Australia]] were referred to collectively as ''Dominions'' for the first time.&lt;ref&gt;Roberts, J. M., ''The Penguin History of the World'' (London: Penguin Books, 1995, {{ISBN|0-14-015495-7}}), p. 777&lt;/ref&gt; Two other [[self-governing colony|self-governing colonies]]—New Zealand and Newfoundland—were granted the status of Dominion in the same year. These were followed by the [[Union of South Africa]] in 1910 and the [[Irish Free State]] in 1922. At the time of the founding of the [[League of Nations]] in 1924, the League Covenant made provision for the admission of any "fully self-governing state, Dominion, or Colony",&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| last=League of Nations| year=1924| title=The Covenant of the League of Nations| location=Article 1| publisher=The Avalon Project at Yale Law School| url=http://avalon.law.yale.edu/20th_century/leagcov.asp| accessdate=20 April 2009| deadurl=no| archiveurl=http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20110724150012/http://avalon.law.yale.edu/20th_century/leagcov.asp| archivedate=24 July 2011| df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; the implication being that "Dominion status was something between that of a [[colony]] and a state".&lt;ref&gt;James Crawford, ''The Creation of States in International Law'' (Oxford: [[Oxford University Press]], 1979, {{ISBN|978-0-19-922842-3}}), p. 243&lt;/ref&gt;

Dominion status was formally defined in the [[Balfour Declaration of 1926]], which recognised these countries as "autonomous {{not a typo|Communities}} within the British Empire", thus acknowledging them as political equals of the United Kingdom. The [[Statute of Westminster 1931]] converted this status into legal reality, making them essentially independent members of what was then called the ''British Commonwealth''.

Following the [[Second World War]], the decline of British colonialism led to Dominions generally being referred to as [[Commonwealth realm]]s and the use of the word ''dominion'' gradually diminished. Nonetheless, though disused, it [[#Canada|remains Canada's legal title]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/index.cfm?PgNm=TCE&amp;Params=J1ARTJ0002344 "Dominion"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930041441/http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/index.cfm?PgNm=TCE&amp;Params=J1ARTJ0002344 |date=30 September 2007 }}. ''Youth Encyclopedia of Canada'' (based on ''[[Canadian Encyclopedia]]''). Historica Foundation of Canada, 2008. Accessed 20 June 2008. "The word "Dominion" is the official status of Canada. ... The term is little used today."&lt;/ref&gt; and the phrase ''Her Majesty's Dominions'' is still used occasionally in legal documents in the United Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;National Health Service Act 2006 (c. 41), sch. 22&lt;/ref&gt;

==={{Anchor|His Majesty's dominions}}{{Anchor|Her Majesty's dominions}}{{Anchor|King's dominions}}{{Anchor|Queen's dominions}}"His/Her Majesty's dominions"===
{{Refimprove section|date=October 2016}}
The phrase ''His/Her Majesty's dominions'' is a legal and constitutional phrase that refers to all the realms and territories of the Sovereign, whether independent or not. Thus, for example, the British ''[[Ireland Act, 1949]]'', recognised that the Republic of Ireland had "ceased to be part of His Majesty's dominions". When dependent territories that had never been [[Annexation|annex]]ed (that is, were not [[colonies of the Crown]], but were [[League of Nations mandate]]s, [[British protectorates|protectorate]]s or [[United Nations Trust Territories]])  were granted independence, the United Kingdom act granting independence always declared that such and such a territory "shall form part of Her Majesty's dominions", and so become part of the territory in which the Queen exercises [[sovereignty]], not merely [[suzerainty]]. The later sense of "Dominion" was capitalised to distinguish it from the more general sense of "dominion".&lt;ref name="Mohr2013"/&gt;

==Historical development==

===Overseas dominions===
The word ''dominions'' originally referred to the [[English overseas possessions|possessions]] of the [[Kingdom of England]]. [[Oliver Cromwell]]'s&lt;!-- not a monarch --&gt; full title in the 1650s was "Lord Protector of the Commonwealth of England, Scotland and Ireland, and the dominions thereto belonging". In 1660, [[Charles II of England|King Charles II]] gave the [[Colony of Virginia]] the title of ''dominion'' in gratitude for Virginia's loyalty to the Crown during the [[English Civil War]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2007}} The [[Virginia|Commonwealth of Virginia]], a [[State of the United States]], still has "[[the Old Dominion]]" as one of its nicknames. ''Dominion'' also occurred in the name of the short-lived [[Dominion of New England]] (1686–1689). In all of these cases, the word ''dominion'' implied no more than being subject to the [[Kingdom of England|English Crown]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}}

===Responsible government: precursor to Dominion status===
{{main|Responsible government|Self-governing colony}}

The foundation of "Dominion" status followed the achievement of internal self-rule in British Colonies, in the specific form of full [[responsible government]] (as distinct from "[[representative government]]"). Colonial responsible government began to emerge during the mid-19th century. The [[legislature]]s of Colonies with responsible government were able to make laws in all matters other than foreign affairs, defence and international trade, these being powers which remained with the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]]. [[Bermuda]], notably, was never defined as a Dominion, despite meeting this criteria, but as a ''self-governing colony'' that remains part of the British [[Commonwealth realm|Realm]].

[[Nova Scotia]] soon followed by the [[Province of Canada]] (which included modern southern [[Ontario]] and southern [[Quebec]]) were the first Colonies to achieve responsible government, in 1848. [[Prince Edward Island]] followed in 1851, and [[New Brunswick]] and [[Newfoundland and Labrador|Newfoundland]] in 1855. All except for Newfoundland and Prince Edward Island agreed to form a new [[federation]] named Canada from 1867.  This was instituted by the British Parliament in the [[Constitution Act, 1867|''British North America Act 1867'']].  ''(See also: [[Canadian Confederation]]).'' Section 3 of the Act referred to the new entity as a "Dominion", the first such entity to be created. From 1870 the Dominion included two vast neighbouring British territories that did not have any form of self-government: [[Rupert's Land]] and the [[North-Western Territory]], parts of which later became the [[Canadian provinces|Provinces]] of [[Manitoba]], [[Saskatchewan]], [[Alberta]], and the separate territories, the [[Northwest Territories]], [[Yukon]] and [[Nunavut]]. In 1871, the [[Crown Colony]] of [[British Columbia]] became a Canadian province, Prince Edward Island joined in 1873 and Newfoundland in 1949.

The conditions under which the four separate Australian colonies—[[New South Wales]], [[Tasmania]], [[Western Australia]], [[South Australia]]—and New Zealand could gain full responsible government were set out by the British government in the ''[[Australian Constitutions Act 1850]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Link to the '''Australian Constitutions Act 1850''' on the website of the National Archives of Australia: [http://www.foundingdocs.gov.au/item.asp?dID=76#significance www.foundingdocs.gov.au] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071203085321/http://www.foundingdocs.gov.au/item.asp?dID=76 |date=3 December 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Act also separated the [[Colony of Victoria]] (in 1851) from New South Wales.

In 1863, the bulk of it was transferred to South Australia, except for a small area that became part of Queensland. See: [http://www.foundingdocs.gov.au/item.asp?dID=49 ''Letters Patent annexing the Northern Territory to South Australia, 1863''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110601183454/http://www.foundingdocs.gov.au/item.asp?dID=49 |date=1 June 2011 }}. In 1911, the Commonwealth of Australia agreed to assume responsibility for administration of the Northern Territory, which was regarded by the government of South Australia as a financial burden.[http://www.foundingdocs.gov.au/item.asp?dID=52 www.foundingdocs.gov.au] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060831094018/http://www.foundingdocs.gov.au/item.asp?dID=52 |date=31 August 2006 }}. The NT did not receive responsible government until 1978.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Western Australia]] did not receive self-government until 1891, mainly because of its continuing financial dependence on the UK Government.&lt;ref&gt;Link to the '''Constitution Act 1890''', which established self-government in Western Australia: [http://www.foundingdocs.gov.au/item.asp?dID=98F www.foundingdocs.gov.au]{{dead link|date=December 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; After protracted negotiations (that initially included New Zealand), six Australian colonies with responsible government (and their dependent territories) agreed to federate, along Canadian lines, becoming the [[Commonwealth of Australia]], in 1901.

In South Africa, the [[Cape Colony]] became the first British self-governing Colony, in 1872. (Until 1893, the Cape Colony also controlled the separate [[Colony of Natal]].) Following the [[Second Boer War]] (1899–1902), the British Empire assumed direct control of the [[Boer Republics]], but transferred limited self-government to [[Transvaal Colony|Transvaal]] in 1906, and the [[Orange River Colony]] in 1907.

The Commonwealth of Australia was recognised as a Dominion in 1901, and the [[Dominion of New Zealand]] and the [[Dominion of Newfoundland]] were officially given Dominion status in 1907, followed by the [[Union of South Africa]] in 1910.

===Canadian Confederation and evolution of the term ''Dominion''===

In connection with proposals for the future government of British North America, use of the term "Dominion" was suggested by [[Samuel Leonard Tilley]] at the [[London Conference of 1866]] discussing the [[Canadian Confederation|confederation]] of the [[Province of Canada]] (subsequently becoming the [[Province of Ontario]] and the [[Province of Quebec]]), [[Nova Scotia]] and [[New Brunswick]] into "One '''''Dominion''''' under the Name of Canada", the first federation internal to the British Empire.&lt;ref name="Spider-man 2099"&gt;{{cite book|author=Alan Rayburn|title=Naming Canada: Stories about Canadian Place Names|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aiUZMOypNB4C&amp;pg=PA17|year=2001|publisher=University of Toronto Press|isbn=978-0-8020-8293-0|pages=17–21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tilley's suggestion was taken from the [[Psalm 72|72nd Psalm]], verse eight, "He shall have ''dominion'' also from sea to sea, and from the river unto the ends of the earth", which is echoed in the national motto, "[[A Mari Usque Ad Mare]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lac-bac.gc.ca/confederation/023001-2085-e.html |archive-url=https://www.collectionscanada.gc.ca/webarchives/20061122121516/http://www.lac-bac.gc.ca/confederation/023001-2085-e.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=22 November 2006 |title=The London Conference December 1866 – March 1867 |publisher=www.collectionscanada.gc.ca |date= |accessdate=11 June 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The new government of Canada under the [[Constitution Act, 1867|British North America Act of 1867]] began to use the phrase "Dominion of Canada" to designate the new, larger nation. However, neither the Confederation nor the adoption of the title of "Dominion" granted extra autonomy or new powers to this new federal level of government.&lt;ref name="Heard"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Forsey"/&gt; Senator [[Eugene Forsey]] wrote that the powers acquired since the 1840s that established the system of [[responsible government]] in Canada would simply be transferred to the new Dominion government:
{{Quote|By the time of Confederation in 1867, this system had been operating in most of what is now central and eastern Canada for almost 20 years. The Fathers of Confederation simply continued the system they knew, the system that was already working, and working well.&lt;ref name="Forsey"&gt;{{cite web |title = How Canadians Govern Themselves |first = Eugene |last = Forsey |accessdate = 14 October 2007 |url = http://www.parl.gc.ca/information/library/idb/forsey/parl_gov_01-e.asp |date = 1990 |deadurl = no |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080211122748/http://www.parl.gc.ca/information/library/idb/forsey/parl_gov_01-e.asp |archivedate = 11 February 2008 |df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The constitutional scholar Andrew Heard has established that Confederation did not legally change Canada's colonial status to anything approaching its later status of a Dominion.
{{Quote|At its inception in 1867, Canada's colonial status was marked by political and legal subjugation to British Imperial supremacy in all aspects of government—legislative, judicial, and executive. The Imperial Parliament at Westminster could legislate on any matter to do with Canada and could override any local legislation, the final court of appeal for Canadian litigation lay with the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in London, the [[Governor General]] had a substantive role as a representative of the British government, and ultimate executive power was vested in the [[British Monarch]]—who was advised only by British ministers in its exercise. Canada's independence came about as each of these sub-ordinations was eventually removed.&lt;ref name="Heard"&gt;{{cite web |title = Canadian Independence |author = Andrew Heard |url = https://www.sfu.ca/~aheard/324/Independence.html |date = 1990 |accessdate = 5 February 2008 |deadurl = no |archiveurl = http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20090506191142/https://www.sfu.ca/~aheard/324/Independence.html |archivedate = 6 May 2009 |df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Heard went on to document the sizeable body of legislation passed by the British Parliament in the latter part of the 19th century that upheld and expanded its Imperial supremacy to constrain that of its colonies, including the new Dominion government in Canada.
{{Quote|When the Dominion of Canada was created in 1867, it was granted powers of self-government to deal with all internal matters, but Britain still retained overall legislative supremacy. This Imperial supremacy could be exercised through several statutory measures. In the first place, the [[Constitution Act, 1867|British North America Act of 1867]] provided in Section 55 that the Governor General may reserve any legislation passed by the two Houses of Parliament for "the signification of Her Majesty's pleasure", which is determined according to Section 57 by the [[British Monarch]] in Council. Secondly, Section 56 provides that the Governor General must forward to "one of Her Majesty's Principal Secretaries of State" in London a copy of any Federal legislation that has been assented to. Then, within two years after the receipt of this copy, the (British) Monarch in Council could disallow an Act. Thirdly, at least four pieces of Imperial legislation constrained the Canadian legislatures. The Colonial Laws Validity Act of 1865 provided that no colonial law could validly conflict with, amend, or repeal Imperial legislation that either explicitly, or by necessary implication, applied directly to that colony. The Merchant Shipping Act of 1894, as well as the Colonial Courts of Admiralty Act of 1890 required reservation of Dominion legislation on those topics for approval by the British Government. Also, the Colonial Stock Act of 1900 provided for the disallowance of any Dominion legislation the British government felt would harm British stockholders of Dominion trustee securities. Most importantly, however, the British Parliament could exercise the legal right of supremacy that it possessed over common law to pass any legislation on any matter affecting the colonies.&lt;ref name="Heard"/&gt;}}

For decades, none of the Dominions were allowed to have its own [[embassies]] or [[consulate]]s in foreign countries. All matters concerning international travel, commerce, etc., had to be transacted through British embassies and consulates. For example, all transactions concerning [[visa (document)|visa]]s and lost or stolen [[passport]]s by citizens of the Dominions were carried out at British diplomatic offices. It was not until the late 1930s and early 1940s that the Dominion governments were allowed to establish their own embassies, and the first two of these that were established by the Dominion governments in [[Ottawa]] and in [[Canberra]] were both established in [[Washington, D.C.]], in the United States.

As Heard later explained, the British government seldom invoked its powers over Canadian legislation. British legislative powers over Canadian domestic policy were largely theoretical and their exercise was increasingly unacceptable in the 1870s and 1880s. The rise to the status of a Dominion and then full independence for Canada and other possessions of the British Empire did not occur by the granting of titles or similar recognition by the British Parliament but by initiatives taken by the new governments of certain former British dependencies to assert their independence and to establish constitutional precedents.
{{Quote|What is remarkable about this whole process is that it was achieved with a minimum of legislative amendments. Much of Canada's independence arose from the development of new political arrangements, many of which have been absorbed into judicial decisions interpreting the constitution—with or without explicit recognition. Canada's passage from being an integral part of the British Empire to being an independent member of the Commonwealth richly illustrates the way in which fundamental constitutional rules have evolved through the interaction of constitutional convention, international law, and municipal statute and case law.&lt;ref name="Heard"/&gt;}}

What was significant about the creation of the Canadian and Australian federations was not that they were instantly granted wide new powers by the Imperial centre at the time of their creation; but that they, because of their greater size and prestige, were better able to exercise their existing powers and lobby for new ones than the various colonies they incorporated could have done separately.  They provided a new model which politicians in New Zealand, Newfoundland, South Africa, Ireland, India, Malaysia could point to for their own relationship with Britain. Ultimately, "[Canada's] example of a peaceful accession to independence with a Westminster system of government came to be followed by 50 countries with a combined population of more than 2-billion people."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Buckley |first=F.

===Colonial Conference of 1907===

Issues of colonial self-government spilled into foreign affairs with the [[Second Boer War|Boer War]] (1899–1902). The self-governing colonies contributed significantly to British efforts to stem the insurrection, but ensured that they set the conditions for participation in these wars. Colonial governments repeatedly acted to ensure that they determined the extent of their peoples' participation in imperial wars in the military build-up to the [[First World War]].

The assertiveness of the self-governing colonies was recognised in the [[Colonial Conference of 1907]], which implicitly introduced the idea of the Dominion as a self-governing colony by referring to Canada and Australia as Dominions. It also retired the name "Colonial Conference" and mandated that meetings take place regularly to consult Dominions in running the foreign affairs of the empire.

The Colony of New Zealand, which chose not to take part in Australian federation, became the [[Dominion of New Zealand]] on 26 September 1907; [[Dominion of Newfoundland|Newfoundland]] became a Dominion on the same day. The [[Union of South Africa]] was referred to as a Dominion upon its creation in 1910.

===First World War and Treaty of Versailles===

[[File:The Empire Needs Men WWI.jpg|right|thumb|upright=1.15|The Parliamentary Recruiting Committee produced this [[First World War]] poster. Designed by [[Arthur Wardle]], the poster urges men from the Dominions of the British Empire to enlist in the war effort.]]

The initiatives and contributions of British colonies to the British war effort in the First World War were recognised by Britain with the creation of the Imperial War Cabinet in 1917, which gave them a say in the running of the war. Dominion status as self-governing states, as opposed to symbolic titles granted various British colonies, waited until 1919, when the self-governing Dominions signed the Treaty of Versailles independently of the British government and became individual members of the League of Nations. This ended the purely colonial status of the Dominions.

&lt;blockquote&gt;The First World War ended the purely colonial period in the history of the Dominions. Their military contribution to the Allied war effort gave them claim to equal recognition with other small states and a voice in the formation of policy. This claim was recognised within the Empire by the creation of the Imperial War Cabinet in 1917, and within the community of nations by Dominion signatures to the Treaty of Versailles and by separate Dominion representation in the League of Nations. In this way the "self-governing Dominions", as they were called, emerged as junior members of the international community. Their status defied exact analysis by both international and constitutional lawyers, but it was clear that they were no longer regarded simply as colonies of Britain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title = The End of Dominion Status|author = F. R. Scott|journal = The American Journal of International Law|volume = 38|date = January 1944|pages = 34–49|doi = 10.2307/2192530|issue = 1|publisher = American Society of International Law|jstor = 2192530}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Irish Free State===

The [[Irish Free State]], set up in 1922 after the [[Anglo-Irish War]], was the first Dominion to appoint a non-British, non-aristocratic Governor-General when [[Timothy Michael Healy]] took the position in 1922. Dominion status was never popular in the [[Irish Free State]] where people saw it as a face-saving measure for a [[Her Majesty's Government|British government]] unable to countenance a [[republic]] in what had previously been the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland]]. Successive Irish governments undermined the constitutional links with Britain until they were severed completely in 1949. In 1937 Ireland adopted, almost simultaneously, both a new [[Constitution of Ireland|constitution]] that included powers for a president of Ireland and a [[Executive Authority (External Relations) Act 1936|law]] confirming a role for the king in external relations.

===Balfour Declaration of 1926 and Statute of Westminster===

The [[Balfour Declaration of 1926]], and the subsequent [[Statute of Westminster 1931|Statute of Westminster]], 1931, restricted Britain's ability to pass or affect laws outside of its own jurisdiction. Significantly, Britain initiated the change to complete sovereignty for the Dominions. The [[First World War]] left Britain saddled with enormous debts, and the Great Depression had further reduced Britain's ability to pay for defence of its empire. In spite of popular opinions of empires, the larger Dominions were reluctant to leave the protection of the then-superpower. For example, many Canadians felt that being part of the British Empire was the only thing that had prevented them from being absorbed into the United States.

Until 1931, Newfoundland was referred to as a colony of the United Kingdom, as for example, in the 1927 reference to the [[Judicial Committee of the Privy Council]] to delineate the Quebec-Labrador boundary. Full autonomy was granted by the United Kingdom parliament with the [[Statute of Westminster 1931|Statute of Westminster]] in December 1931. However, the government of Newfoundland "requested the United Kingdom not to have sections 2 to 6[—]confirming Dominion status[—]apply automatically to it[,] until the Newfoundland Legislature first approved the Statute, approval which the Legislature subsequently never gave". In any event, Newfoundland's [[letters patent]] of 1934 suspended self-government and instituted a "[[Commission of Government]]", which continued until Newfoundland became a [[Provinces and territories of Canada|province of Canada]] in 1949. It is the view of some constitutional lawyers{{Citation needed|date=April 2014}} that—although Newfoundland chose not to exercise all of the functions of a Dominion like Canada—its status as a Dominion was "suspended" in 1934, rather than "revoked" or "abolished".

Canada, Australia, New Zealand, the Irish Free State, Newfoundland and South Africa (prior to becoming a republic and leaving the Commonwealth in 1961), with their large populations of European descent, were sometimes collectively referred to as the "White Dominions".&lt;ref name="merriman"&gt;Europe Since 1914: Encyclopedia of the Age of War and Reconstruction; John Merriman and Jay Winter; 2006; see the British Empire entry which lists the "White Dominions" above except Newfoundland&lt;/ref&gt; Today Canada, Australia, New Zealand and the United Kingdom are sometimes referred to collectively as the "[[Old Commonwealth|White Commonwealth]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/march-of-the-white-commonwealth-is-uk-entry-for-working-holidays-easier-if-youre-the-right-colour-5431486.html|title=March of the white commonwealth: Is UK entry for working holidays|author=|date=23 January 1994|website=independent.co.uk|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170206111611/http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/march-of-the-white-commonwealth-is-uk-entry-for-working-holidays-easier-if-youre-the-right-colour-5431486.html|archivedate=6 February 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However the British government was afraid of offending the Americans so it insisted on the Fathers finding another title. The term "Dominion" was drawn from Psalm 72. In the realms of political terminology, the term dominion can be directly attributed to the Fathers of Confederation and it is one of the very few, distinctively Canadian contributions in this area. It remains our country's official title.

===Australia===

Four colonies of Australia had enjoyed responsible government since 1856: New South Wales, Victoria, Tasmania and South Australia.&lt;ref&gt;B. Hunter (ed), The Stateman's Year Book 1996-1997, Macmillan Press Ltd, pp. 130-156&lt;/ref&gt; Queensland had responsible government soon after its founding in 1859&lt;ref&gt;Order in Council of the UK Privy Council, 6 June 1859, establishing responsible government in Queensland.

In 1930, the Australian prime minister, [[James Scullin]], reinforced the right of the overseas Dominions to appoint native-born governors-general, when he advised King [[George V of the United Kingdom|George V]] to appoint Sir [[Isaac Isaacs]] as his representative in Australia, against the wishes of the opposition and officials in London. The governments of the States (called colonies before 1901) remained under the Commonwealth but retained links to the UK until the passage of the ''[[Australia Act 1986]]''.

{{See also|Name of Canada#Adoption of ''Dominion''}}

The term ''Dominion'' is employed in the [[Constitution Act, 1867]] (originally the [[British North America Acts|British North America Act, 1867]]), and describes the resulting political union. Specifically, the preamble of the act states: "Whereas the Provinces of Canada, Nova Scotia, and New Brunswick have expressed their Desire to be federally united into One Dominion under the Crown of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, with a Constitution similar in Principle to that of the United Kingdom..." Furthermore, Sections 3 and 4 indicate that the provinces "shall form and be One Dominion under the Name of Canada; and on and after that Day those Three Provinces shall form and be One Dominion under that Name accordingly".

Usage of the phrase ''Dominion of Canada'' was employed as the country's name after 1867, predating the general use of the term ''Dominion'' as applied to the other autonomous regions of the [[British Empire]] after 1907. The phrase ''Dominion of Canada'' does not appear in the 1867 act nor in the [[Constitution Act, 1982]], but does appear in the [[List of Canadian constitutional documents|Constitution Act, 1871]], other contemporaneous texts, and subsequent bills. References to the ''Dominion of Canada'' in later acts, such as the [[Statute of Westminster 1931|Statute of Westminster]], do not clarify the point because all nouns were formally [[capitalization|capitalised]] in British legislative style. Indeed, in the original text of the Constitution Act, 1867, "One" and "Name" were also capitalised.

[[F. R. Scott|Frank Scott]] theorised that Canada's status as a Dominion ended when [[Canadian parliament]] declared war on Germany on 9 September 1939, separately and distinctly from the United Kingdom's declaration of war six days earlier.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Scott|first=Frank R.|title=The End of Dominion Status|journal=The American Journal of International Law|volume=38|issue=1|date=January 1944|pages=34–49|url=http://heinonline.org/HOL/LandingPage?collection=journals&amp;handle=hein.journals/ajil38&amp;div=8&amp;id=&amp;page=|doi=10.2307/2192530|publisher=American Society of International Law|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130728231653/http://heinonline.org/HOL/LandingPage?collection=journals&amp;handle=hein.journals%2Fajil38&amp;div=8&amp;id=&amp;page=|archivedate=28 July 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; From the 1950s, the federal government began to phase out the use of ''Dominion'', which had been used largely as a synonym of "federal" or "national" such as "Dominion building" for a post office, "Dominion-provincial relations", and so on. The last major change was renaming the national holiday from [[Dominion Day]] to [[Canada Day]] in 1982. Official [[bilingualism]] laws also contributed to the disuse of ''Dominion'', as it has no acceptable equivalent in French.

While the term may be found in older official documents, and the Dominion Carillonneur still tolls at [[Parliament Hill]], it is now hardly used to distinguish the federal government from the provinces or (historically) Canada before and after 1867. Nonetheless, the federal government continues to produce publications and educational materials that specify the currency of these official titles.&lt;ref name="cdngovflag" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

Defenders of the title ''Dominion''—including [[Monarchism in Canada|monarchists]] who see signs of creeping [[Canadian republicanism|republicanism]] in Canada—take comfort in the fact that the Constitution Act, 1982 does not mention and therefore does not remove the title, and that a constitutional amendment is required to change it.&lt;ref name="hodgetts" /&gt;

The word ''Dominion'' has been used with other agencies, laws, and roles:

* Dominion Carillonneur: official responsible for playing the carillons at the [[Peace Tower]] since 1916
* [[Dominion Day]] (1867–1982): holiday marking Canada's national day; now called [[Canada Day]]
* [[Dominion Observatory]] (1905–1970): weather observatory in [[Ottawa]]; now used as Office of Energy Efficiency, Energy Branch, [[Natural Resources Canada]]
* [[Dominion Lands Act]] (1872): federal lands act; repealed in 1918
* [[Dominion Bureau of Statistics]] (1918–1971): superseded by [[Statistics Canada]]
* [[Dominion Police]] (1867–1920): merged to form the [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police]] (RCMP)
* [[Dominion Astrophysical Observatory]] (1918–present); now part of the [[National Research Council (Canada)|National Research Council]] [[Herzberg Institute of Astrophysics]]
* [[Dominion Radio Astrophysical Observatory]] (1960–present); now part of the [[National Research Council (Canada)|National Research Council]] [[Herzberg Institute of Astrophysics]]
* [[Dominion of Canada Rifle Association]] founded in 1868 and incorporated by an Act of Parliament in 1890

Notable Canadian corporations and organizations (not affiliated with government) that have used ''Dominion'' as a part of their name have included:

* The [[Dominion Bank]], opened 1871
** The [[Toronto-Dominion Bank]], its successor since a 1955 merger with the [[Bank of Toronto]]; as of 2016 one of the country's major banks
* The [[Dominion of Canada General Insurance Company]], founded in 1887; bought out by [[The Travelers Companies|Travelers]] in 2013
* The [[Dominion Atlantic Railway]], in Nova Scotia, formed by the 1894 merger of two railways; controlled by the [[Canadian Pacific Railway]] after 1911, shut down in 1994
* [[Dominion (supermarket)|Dominion Stores]], a supermarket chain founded in 1927; following a series of acquisitions the last Dominion stores were renamed as [[Metro Inc.|Metro]] stores in 2008
* The Dominion Institute, created in 1997 to promote awareness of Canadian history and national identity
** The Historica-Dominion Institute, its successor following a 2009 merger with the Historica Foundation; renamed [[Historica Canada]] in 2013

===Ceylon===

[[Ceylon]], which, as a Crown colony, was originally promised "fully responsible status within the British Commonwealth of Nations", was formally granted independence as a [[Dominion of Ceylon|Dominion]] in 1948. In 1972 it adopted a republican constitution to become the Free, Sovereign and Independent Republic of Sri Lanka. By a new constitution in 1978, it became the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka.

===Irish Free State / Ireland===
The [[Irish Free State]] (Ireland from 1937) was a British Dominion between 1922 and 1949. As established by the [[Irish Free State Constitution Act 1922|Irish Free State Constitution Act]] of the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|United Kingdom Parliament]] on 6 December 1922 the new state—which had Dominion status in the likeness of that enjoyed by Canada within the [[Commonwealth of Nations|British Commonwealth of Nations]]—comprised the whole of Ireland. However, provision was made in the Act for the [[Parliament of Northern Ireland]] to opt out of inclusion in the Irish Free State, which—as had been widely expected at the time—it duly did one day after the creation of the new state, on 7 December 1922.&lt;ref&gt;On 7 December 1922 (the day after the establishment of the Irish Free State) the [[Parliament of Northern Ireland|Parliament]] resolved to make the following address to the [[George V of the United Kingdom|King]] so as to ''opt out'' of the Irish Free State: "MOST GRACIOUS SOVEREIGN, We, your Majesty's most dutiful and loyal subjects, the Senators and Commons of Northern Ireland in Parliament assembled, having learnt of the passing of the [[Irish Free State Constitution Act 1922|Irish Free State Constitution Act, 1922]], being the Act of Parliament for the ratification of the Articles of Agreement for a Treaty between Great Britain and Ireland, do, by this humble Address, pray your Majesty that the powers of the Parliament and Government of the Irish Free State shall no longer extend to Northern Ireland". Source: [http://stormontpapers.ahds.ac.uk/stormontpapers/pageview.html?volumeno=2&amp;pageno=1145#bak-2-1149 Northern Ireland Parliamentary Report, 7 December 1922] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090319082024/http://stormontpapers.ahds.ac.uk/stormontpapers/pageview.html?volumeno=2&amp;pageno=1145 |date=19 March 2009 }} and [http://www.nationalarchives.ie/topics/anglo_irish/dfaexhib2.html Anglo-Irish Treaty, sections 11, 12].&lt;/ref&gt;

Following a plebiscite of the people of the Free State held on 1 July 1937, [[Constitution of Ireland|a new constitution]] came into force on 29 December of that year, establishing a [[Republic of Ireland|successor state]] with the name of "Ireland" which ceased to participate in Commonwealth conferences and events. Nevertheless, the United Kingdom and other member states of the Commonwealth continued to regard Ireland as a Dominion owing to the unusual role accorded to the British Monarch under the [[Executive Authority (External Relations) Act 1936|Irish External Relations Act]] of 1936. Ultimately, however, Ireland's [[Oireachtas]] passed the [[Republic of Ireland Act]] 1948, which came into force on 18 April 1949 and unequivocally ended Ireland's links with the British Monarch and the Commonwealth.

===Newfoundland===

The colony of [[Colony of Newfoundland|Newfoundland]] enjoyed responsible government from 1855 to 1934.&lt;ref&gt;The Statesman's Year Book, p. 302&lt;/ref&gt; It was among the colonies declared Dominions in 1907. Following the recommendations of a Royal Commission, parliamentary government was suspended in 1934 due to severe financial difficulties resulting from the depression and a series of riots against the Dominion government in 1932.&lt;ref&gt;The Statesman's Year Book, p. 303&lt;/ref&gt; In 1949, it joined Canada and the [[Newfoundland and Labrador House of Assembly|legislature]] was restored.&lt;ref&gt;The Statesman's Year Book&lt;/ref&gt;

===New Zealand===

The [[New Zealand Constitution Act 1852]] gave New Zealand its own Parliament (General Assembly) and home rule in 1852.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.teara.govt.nz/1966/H/HistoryConstitutional/TheLegislativeAuthorityOfTheNewZealand/en |title=History, Constitutional - The Legislative Authority of the New Zealand Parliament - 1966 Encyclopaedia of New Zealand |publisher=www.teara.govt.nz |date=22 April 2009 |accessdate=11 June 2010 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090428044925/http://www.teara.govt.nz/1966/H/HistoryConstitutional/TheLegislativeAuthorityOfTheNewZealand/en |archivedate=28 April 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1907 New Zealand was proclaimed the [[Dominion of New Zealand]].&lt;ref name="nzhistory1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nzhistory.net.nz/politics/dominion-status |title=Dominion status |publisher=NZHistory |date= |accessdate=11 June 2010 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100603194654/http://www.nzhistory.net.nz/politics/dominion-status |archivedate=3 June 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; New Zealand, Canada, and Newfoundland used the word Dominion in the official title of the nation, whereas Australia used [[Commonwealth of Australia]] and South Africa [[Union of South Africa]].

In 1986, the New Zealand parliament passed the [[Constitution Act 1986]], which repealed the Constitution Act of 1852 and the last constitutional links with the United Kingdom, formally ending its Dominion status.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Prof. Dr. Axel Tschentscher, LL.

===South Africa===

The [[Union of South Africa]] was formed in 1910 from the four self-governing colonies of the [[Cape Colony]], [[Colony of Natal|Natal]], the [[Transvaal Colony|Transvaal]], and the [[Orange Free State]] (the last two were former [[Boer]] republics).&lt;ref&gt;The Stateman's Year Book p. 1156&lt;/ref&gt; The [[South Africa Act 1909]] provided for a Parliament consisting of a Senate and a House of Assembly. The provinces had their own legislatures. In 1961, the Union of South Africa adopted a new constitution, became a republic, left the Commonwealth (and re-joined following end of Apartheid rule in the 1990s), and became the present-day [[South Africa|Republic of South Africa]].&lt;ref&gt;[[s:South Africa Act 1909#Provincial Councils|Wikisource: South Africa Act 1909]]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Southern Rhodesia===
[[File:Zimbabwe in Africa.svg|thumb|[[Southern Rhodesia]] (Zimbabwe since 1980), coloured red on a map of Africa|alt=A map. See description]]
[[Southern Rhodesia]] (renamed Zimbabwe in 1980) was a special case in the [[British Empire]]. Although it was never a Dominion, it was treated as a Dominion in many respects. Southern Rhodesia was formed in 1923 out of [[company rule in Rhodesia|territories]] of the [[British South Africa Company]] and established as a self-governing colony with substantial autonomy on the model of the Dominions. The imperial authorities in London retained direct powers over foreign affairs, constitutional alterations, native administration and bills regarding mining revenues, railways and the governor's salary.&lt;ref name=rowland245251/&gt;

Southern Rhodesia was not one of the territories that were mentioned in the 1931 [[Statute of Westminster 1931|Statute of Westminster]] although relations with Southern Rhodesia were administered in London through the [[Dominion Office]], not the [[Colonial Office]]. When the Dominions were first treated as foreign countries by London for the purposes of diplomatic immunity in 1952, Southern Rhodesia was included in the list of territories concerned. This semi-Dominion status continued in Southern Rhodesia between 1953 and 1963, when it joined [[Northern Rhodesia]] and [[Nyasaland]] in the [[Central African Federation]], with the latter two territories continuing to be British protectorates. When Northern Rhodesia was given independence in 1964 it adopted the new name of Zambia, prompting Southern Rhodesia to shorten its name to [[Rhodesia]], but Britain did not recognise this latter change.&lt;ref name=rowland245251&gt;{{cite journal

===Other Dominions===

Several of Britain's newly independent colonies were dominions during the period from the late 1950s to the early 1990s. Their gradualist constitutions, featuring a Westminster-style parliamentary government and the British monarch as head of state, were typically replaced by republican constitutions in less than a generation:

{{quote|After World War II, Britain attempted to repeat the Dominion model in decolonizing the Caribbean. ... Though several colonies, such as Guyana and Trinidad and Tobago, maintained their formal allegiance to the British monarch, they soon revised their status to become republics. Britain also attempted to establish a Dominion model in decolonizing Africa, but it, too, was unsuccessful. ... Ghana, the first former colony declared a Dominion in 1957, soon demanded recognition as a republic. Other African nations followed a similar pattern throughout the 1960s: Nigeria, Tanganyika, Uganda, Kenya, and Malawi. In fact, only Gambia, Sierra Leone, and Mauritius retained their Dominion status for more than three years.&lt;ref&gt;Brandon Jernigan, "British Empire" in M. Juang &amp; Noelle Morrissette, eds., ''Africa and the Americas: Culture, Politics, and History'' (ABC-CLIO, 2008) p. 204.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In Africa, the [[Dominion of Ghana]] (formerly the [[Gold Coast (British colony)|Gold Coast]]) existed from 1957 until 1960, when it became the [[Republic of Ghana]]. The [[Federation of Nigeria]] was established as a dominion in 1960, but became the [[Federal Republic of Nigeria]] in 1963.&lt;ref&gt;"For the first three years of its independence, Nigeria was a dominion.

==Foreign relations==

{{Unreferenced section|date=February 2012}}

Initially, the Foreign Office of the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|United Kingdom]] conducted the foreign relations of the Dominions. A Dominions section was created within the Colonial Office for this purpose in 1907. Canada set up its own [[Department of Foreign Affairs and International Trade|Department of External Affairs]] in June 1909, but diplomatic relations with other governments continued to operate through the governors-general, Dominion High Commissioners in London (first appointed by Canada in 1880; Australia followed only in 1910), and British legations abroad. Britain deemed her declaration of war against [[German Empire|Germany]] in August 1914 to extend to all territories of the Empire without the need for consultation, occasioning some displeasure in Canadian official circles and contributing to a brief anti-British insurrection by [[Afrikaners|Afrikaner]] militants in South Africa later that year. A Canadian War Mission in [[Washington, D.C.]], dealt with supply matters from February 1918 to March 1921.

Although the Dominions had had no formal voice in declaring war, each became a separate signatory of the June 1919 peace [[Treaty of Versailles]], which had been negotiated by a British-led united Empire delegation. In September 1922, Dominion reluctance to support [[Chanak Crisis|British military action]] against [[Ottoman Empire|Turkey]] influenced Britain's decision to seek a compromise settlement. Diplomatic autonomy soon followed, with the U.S.-Canadian [[Halibut Treaty]] (March 1923) marking the first time an international agreement had been entirely negotiated and concluded independently by a Dominion. The Dominions Section of the [[Colonial Office]] was upgraded in June 1926 to a separate Dominions Office; however, initially, this office was held by the same person that held the office of [[Secretary of State for the Colonies]].

The principle of Dominion equality with Britain and independence in foreign relations was formally recognised by the [[Balfour Declaration 1926|Balfour Declaration]], adopted at the [[Imperial Conferences|Imperial Conference]] of November 1926. Canada's first permanent diplomatic mission to a foreign country opened in Washington, D.C., in 1927. In 1928, Canada obtained the appointment of a British [[high commissioner]] in [[Ottawa]], separating the administrative and diplomatic functions of the governor-general and ending the latter's anomalous role as the representative of the British government in relations between the two countries. The Dominions Office was given a separate [[Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs|secretary of state]] in June 1930, though this was entirely for domestic political reasons given the need to relieve the burden on one ill minister whilst moving another away from unemployment policy. The Balfour Declaration was enshrined in the [[Statute of Westminster 1931]] when it was adopted by the British Parliament and subsequently ratified by the Dominion legislatures.

Britain's declaration of [[World War II|hostilities against Nazi Germany]] on 3 September 1939 tested the issue. Most took the view that the declaration did not commit the Dominions. Ireland chose to remain neutral. At the other extreme, the conservative Australian government of the day, led by [[Robert Menzies]], took the view that, since Australia had not adopted the Statute of Westminster, it was legally bound by the UK declaration of war—which had also been the view at the outbreak of the First World War—though this was contentious within Australia. Between these two extremes, New Zealand declared that as Britain was or would be at war, so it was too. This was, however, a matter of political choice rather than legal necessity. Canada issued its own declaration of war after a recall of Parliament, as did South Africa after a delay of several days (South Africa on 6 September, Canada on 10 September). [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]], which had negotiated the removal of British forces from its territory the year before, remained neutral. There were soon signs of growing independence from the other Dominions: Australia opened a diplomatic mission in the US in 1940, as did New Zealand in 1941, and Canada's mission in Washington gained [[Canadian Embassy in Washington|embassy]] status in 1943.

==From Dominions to Commonwealth realms==

{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2011}}

[[File:CommonwealthPrimeMinisters1944.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.15|The prime ministers of Britain and the four major Dominions at the 1944 [[Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting|Commonwealth Prime Ministers' Conference]]. Left to right: [[William Lyon Mackenzie King]] (Canada); [[Jan Smuts]] (South Africa); [[Winston Churchill]] (UK); [[Peter Fraser (New Zealand politician)|Peter Fraser]] (New Zealand); [[John Curtin]] (Australia).]]

Initially, the Dominions conducted their own trade policy, some limited foreign relations and had autonomous [[armed forces]], although the British government claimed and exercised the exclusive power to declare wars. However, after the passage of the [[Statute of Westminster 1931|Statute of Westminster]] the language of dependency on the Crown of the United Kingdom ceased, where the Crown itself was no longer referred to as the Crown of any place in particular but simply as "the Crown". [[Arthur Berriedale Keith]], in Speeches and Documents on the British Dominions 1918–1931, stated that "the Dominions are sovereign international States in the sense that the King in respect of each of His Dominions (Newfoundland excepted) is such a State in the eyes of international law". After then, those countries that were previously referred to as "Dominions" became Commonwealth realms where the sovereign reigns no longer as the British monarch, but as monarch of each nation in its own right, and are considered equal to the UK and one another.

The [[Second World War]], which fatally undermined Britain's already weakened commercial and financial leadership, further loosened the political ties between Britain and the Dominions. Australian Prime Minister [[John Curtin]]'s unprecedented action (February 1942) in successfully countermanding an order from British Prime Minister [[Winston Churchill]] that Australian troops be diverted to defend British-held [[Myanmar|Burma]] (the 7th Division was then en route from the Middle East to Australia to defend against an expected Japanese invasion) demonstrated that Dominion governments might no longer subordinate their own national interests to British strategic perspectives. To ensure that Australia had full legal power to act independently, particularly in relation to foreign affairs, defence industry and military operations, and to validate its past independent action in these areas, Australia formally adopted the Statute of Westminster in October 1942&lt;ref&gt;''Statute of Westminster Adoption Act 1942'' (Act no. 56 of 1942). The long title for the Act was "To remove Doubts as to the Validity of certain Commonwealth Legislation, to obviate Delays occurring in its Passage, and to effect certain related purposes, by adopting certain Sections of the Statute of Westminster, 1931, as from the Commencement of the War between His Majesty the King and Germany." Link: [http://www.foundingdocs.gov.au/item.asp?sdID=96 ''www.foundingdocs.gov.au''] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050716075624/http://www.foundingdocs.gov.au/item.asp?sdID=96 |date=16 July 2005 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; and backdated the adoption to the start of the war in September 1939.

The Dominions Office merged with the [[India Office]] as the [[Commonwealth Relations Office]] upon the independence of India and [[Pakistan]] in August 1947. The last country officially made a Dominion was [[Sri Lanka|Ceylon]] in 1948. The term "Dominion" fell out of general use thereafter. [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]] ceased to be a member of the Commonwealth on 18 April 1949, upon the coming into force of the [[Republic of Ireland Act 1948]]. This formally signalled the end of the former dependencies' common constitutional connection to the British Crown. India also adopted a republican constitution in January 1950. Unlike many dependencies that became republics, Ireland never re-joined the Commonwealth, which agreed to accept the British monarch as head of that association of independent states.

The independence of the separate realms was emphasised after the accession of Queen [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Elizabeth II]] in 1952, when she was proclaimed not just as [[Queen of the United Kingdom]], but also [[Canadian Monarchy|Queen of Canada]], [[Monarchy in Australia|Queen of Australia]], [[Monarchy in New Zealand|Queen of New Zealand]], and of all her other "realms and territories" etc. This also reflected the change from ''Dominion'' to ''realm''; in the proclamation of [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Queen Elizabeth II]]'s [[Style of the British sovereign#Styles of British sovereigns|new titles in 1953]], the phrase "of her other Realms and Territories" replaced "Dominion" with another mediaeval French word with the same connotation, "realm" (from ''royaume''). Thus, recently, when referring to one of those sixteen countries within the Commonwealth of Nations that share the same monarch, the phrase ''[[Commonwealth realm]]'' has come into common usage instead of ''Dominion'' to differentiate the Commonwealth nations that continue to share the [[monarch]] as [[head of state]] (Australia, Canada, New Zealand, Jamaica, etc.) from those that do not (India, Pakistan, South Africa, etc.). The term "Dominion" is still found in the [[Canadian constitution]] where it appears numerous times, but it is largely a vestige of the past, as the Canadian government does not actively use it (''see [[#Canada|Canada]] section''). The term "realm" does not appear in the Canadian constitution.

The generic language of Dominion did not cease in relation to the Sovereign. It was, and is, used to describe territories in which the monarch exercises sovereignty.

Many distinctive characteristics that once pertained only to Dominions are now shared by other states in the Commonwealth, whether [[republic]]s, independent realms, associated states or territories. The practice of appointing a High Commissioner instead of a diplomatic representative such as an ambassador for communication between the government of a Dominion and the British government in London continues in respect of Commonwealth realms and republics as sovereign states.

== Charter school leadership ==
&lt;!-- This section is named as it is because it does not include her Education Committee leadership, covered in politics, and her earlier teaching, covered biographically. --&gt;

Before entering electoral politics, Moskowitz applied to start a charter school in the [[Upper East Side]], more recently telling [[Kyle Spencer]] "you can live on a posh street and be zoned for a very terrible school."&lt;ref name="SpecEdChampBrownstone-CapNY"&gt;[http://www.capitalnewyork.com/article/politics/2011/05/2060993/special-ed-charter-school-champ-eva-moskowitz-makes-play-brownstone?page=all Spencer, Kyle, ''Special Ed: Charter-School Champ Eva Moskowitz Makes a Play For Brownstone New York'', in ''Capital New York'', May 12, 2011, 8:48 a.m.], as accessed June 2, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Moskowitz withdrew the application before holding electoral office.&lt;ref name="SpecEdChampBrownstone-CapNY" /&gt;

=== Views ===

==== Inadequacy of common education ====
Moskowitz said, on international comparisons of education, "even our highest-performing students are doing worse than many other countries' lowest-performing students",&lt;ref name="Bartiromo"&gt;Bartiromo, Maria, host, ''Wall Street Journal Report'', on ''CNBC'' (''CNBC News Transcripts''), January 14 or 15, 2012, 7:30 p.m. E.S.T.&lt;/ref&gt; there's {{"'}}an international crisis,' affecting the affluent neighborhoods she's now [2012] targeting just as seriously as it affects poor ones", according to Hanlon partly quoting Moskowitz,&lt;ref name="LimitMoskowitzModelUntilMayor-CapNY" /&gt; and Moskowitz said that "[she doesn't] think that Americans have totally digested the global competition that we're facing."&lt;ref&gt;Bungeroth, Megan Finnegan, ''Upper West Success Settles in After Controversial Start'', in ''West Side Spirit'' (New York, N.Y.), December 1, 2011, p.&amp;nbsp;8.&lt;/ref&gt;

She states that even in middle-class and more affluent districts public noncharter schools are not as good as parents think they are.&lt;ref name="Mitchell"&gt;[http://co.chalkbeat.org/2010/02/19/5-questions-for-eva-moskowitz/ Mitchell, Nancy, ''5 Questions For Eva Moskowitz'', in ''Chalkbeat Colorado'', February 19, 2010 (page text)], as accessed June 18, 2012 (at prior URL and publication title), &amp; April 5, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; She disagreed with requiring children to go to where they are zoned.&lt;ref name="Eichna"&gt;Eichna, Charlotte, ''Charter Crusader: Eva Moskowitz'', in ''Our Town'' (East Side (Manhattan), New York, N.Y.), April 1, 2010, pp.&amp;nbsp;10–11.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="todo"&gt;[http://articles.nydailynews.com/2010-11-15/news/27081224_1_public-schools-school-leaders-national-education-reform-movement Moskowitz, Eva, ''A To-Do List For N.Y.C.

L., ''Only Days to Save Kids From Failing Schools'', in ''N.Y. Amsterdam News'', March 27, 2003, p.&amp;nbsp;3.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to David M. Herszenhorn, in early 2004, Moskowitz questioned whether holding failing 3rd-graders back would boost 4th-grade test scores the next year, because the lower-performing students would still be in the 3rd grade and not taking the 4th-grade tests, just when the Mayor would run for reelection,&lt;ref name="Herszenhorn"&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2004/01/16/nyregion/special-help-for-3rd-graders-is-promised.html Herszenhorn, David M., ''Special Help For 3rd Graders Is Promised'', in ''N.Y. Times'', January 16, 2004], as accessed February 21, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; but city officials called her criticism, in Herszenhorn's word, "cynical".&lt;ref name="Herszenhorn" /&gt; Moskowitz, wrote Herszenhorn, arguing that "there is a consensus among educators that policies against social promotion don't work",&lt;ref name="Herszenhorn"/&gt;{{Efn|[[Social promotion]], promoting a student with peers even if the student did not complete educational requirements}} called for, in Herszenhorn's paraphrasing of Moskowitz, "the city&amp;nbsp;... to be more creative in its efforts to help struggling students, by improving prekindergarten programs, identifying learning disabilities earlier and perhaps having more nuanced grade levels, like a first grade-plus for students repeating first grade."&lt;ref name="Herszenhorn"/&gt;{{Efn|[[Pre-kindergarten]], a class before kindergarten}} According to Joyce Mayer Perry, in 2004, Moskowitz did not oppose having a failing student repeat a grade but believed that intervention needed to be earlier so that children will succeed.&lt;ref name="Perry"/&gt;

According to Moskowitz, co-locating charters in buildings with noncharters lets parents more easily compare how well their children do in one and how badly in the other and so find out that noncharter schools can be better.&lt;ref name="CharterSchoolEnvy-opNYPost"&gt;[http://www.nypost.com/p/news/opinion/opedcolumnists/charter_school_envy_0oh8SUU7Fv5y1CVeKCf0IK Moskowitz, Eva, ''Charter-School Envy: Spotlight on District Dysfunction'', in ''N.Y. Post'', last updated July 22, 2012, 11:41 p.m.], as accessed July 25, 2012 (opinion column).&lt;/ref&gt; She opposed conditioning co-location on letting noncharter schools get credit for charter students' higher test scores, referring to a law in [[Ohio]], because, according to her, it denies accountability and a ''quid pro quo'' has to be more carefully chosen.&lt;ref name="Mitchell" /&gt;

According to Brill and as interpreted by Boykin Curry, Moskowitz doubted that the New York City public school system can simply be reformed, because it may need a complete turnaround, a replacing of the traditional model with a model derived from charters.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Brill|2011|pp=419–420}} (Boykin Curry's full name Ravenel Boykin Curry IV, per p.&amp;nbsp;116).&lt;/ref&gt; Moskowitz wrote that "[while] much of the growth in excellent public schools has occurred in low-income communities&amp;nbsp;.... [m]iddle-class neighborhoods [also] need more rigorous schools."&lt;ref name="todo"/&gt; She chose to start charter schools "to demonstrate the incredible difference it truly makes when a school is run free from crushing bureaucracy and outlandish labor contracts."&lt;ref name="CharterSchoolEnvy-opNYPost" /&gt;

She said that public elementary school curricula are not challenging enough for students,&lt;ref name="Ronalds-Hannon"&gt;[http://www.crainsnewyork.com/article/20110719/FREE/110719894 Ronalds-Hannon, Eliza, ''Finding a Cure For Public Education's Ills'', in ''Crain's New York Business'', July 19, 2011, 3:47 p.m.], as accessed June 4, 2012 (reporting on Crain's Future of New York conference).&lt;/ref&gt; who are bored.&lt;ref name="Benjamin"&gt;[http://capitaltonightny.ynn.com/2012/08/eva-moskowitz-touts-charter-school-success/ Benjamin, Liz, host, ''Eva Moskowitz Touts Charter School Success'', in ''Capital Tonight'', on ''YNN'' (''Your News Now''), filed August 2, 2012, 9:00 p.m.], as accessed August 11, 25, &amp; 26 &amp; September 6, 2012, as accessed August 26, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--approximately 2 min 36 s from start to approx. 2 min 57 s--&gt; She, with Arin Lavinia, wrote that math curricula are paced to be taught too slowly, as if they're designed for dysfunctional schools and all schools are expected to be just as slow, and Moskowitz and Lavinia argued for speeding the teaching.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Moskowitz|Lavinia|2012|p=64}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Moskowitz said, in 2009, that state tests are "too easy"&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/20/education/20farms.html Hernandez, Javier C., ''A Moo-Moo Here, and Better Test Scores Later'', in ''N.Y. Times'', October 19, 2009], as accessed May 16, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; and, in 2012, that test success would predict economic success&lt;ref name="Bartiromo" /&gt; and that "if kids do not do well on the tests, they certainly won't do well in life"&lt;ref name="Bartiromo" /&gt; but that "I wouldn't want a school that only focused on testing, partly because the tests are a low bar."&lt;ref name="Bartiromo"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Perry"&gt;Perry, Joyce Mayer, ''Mayor's Goal Reached: Nearly 12,000 3rd-Graders to be Left Behind'', in ''N.Y. Amsterdam News'', vol. 95, issue 25, June 17–23, 2004, p.&amp;nbsp;4.&lt;/ref&gt;

She favored closing failing public schools,&lt;ref&gt;Cano, Karla, &amp; Jack Sidransky, ''Children'sPressline: Council Members Respond to Kids' Concerns'', in ''N.Y. Amsterdam News'', vol. 96, issue 2, May 26–June 2, 2005, p.&amp;nbsp;18.&lt;/ref&gt; including charter schools,&lt;ref name="todo"/&gt; not all charter schools being good.&lt;ref name="Mitchell"/&gt; She posited that a charter is not a guarantee of success, as it is only a grant of freedom to try for success.&lt;ref name="Mitchell" /&gt;

==== Challenges confronting teachers ====
Moskowitz has criticized schools of education, including master's programs, for graduating teachers who are unable to meet urban challenges.&lt;ref name="Iasevoli"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ronalds-Hannon"/&gt; She argued against lengthy, detailed, and relatively inflexible teachers' union contracts and "ossified, bureaucratic management"&lt;ref name="Bartiromo" /&gt; as overly constraining principals.&lt;ref name="Benjamin"/&gt;&lt;!--approximately 7 min 41 s from start to approx. 8 min 2 s--&gt;

==== Parental participation ====
Moskowitz believed in parental choice for where children go to school, including parochial and other schools.&lt;ref name="Mitchell"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Eichna"/&gt; She does not want to "eradicate" noncharter schools, believing they need to be modernized "educationally, operationally, financially",&lt;ref name="Benjamin"/&gt;&lt;!-- approximately 8 min 52 s from start to approx. 9 min 15 s--&gt; and she argued for competition to improve failing public schools nationwide.&lt;ref name="NewBkSAAdvice-SchBk"&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/schoolbook/2012/06/14/in-book-success-academy-operator-promotes-charter-schools-and-offers-advice/ Spencer, Kyle, ''In New Book, Success Academy Operator Promotes Charter Schools and Offers Advice'', in ''SchoolBook'', June 14, 2012, 1:26 p.m.], as accessed June 23, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; She supported parents at noncharter schools raising money to hire teaching assistants of their choice, opposing the teachers' union's objections.&lt;ref name="UFTvParentsTeachAssts-NYDaNews"&gt;[http://www.nydailynews.com/opinion/uft-city-parents-stopping-hiring-teaching-assistants-union-sells-kids-article-1.426110 Moskowitz, Eva, ''It's the UFT vs. City Parents: By Stopping Hiring of Teaching Assistants, the Union Sells Out Kids'', in ''Daily News'' (New York, N.Y.), July 28, 2009, 5:37 p.m. (opinion)], as accessed June 23, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Moskowitz said she's "never met an apathetic mom."&lt;ref name="Mitchell"/&gt;&lt;!--approximately 9 min 54 s from start to approx. 9 min 56 s--&gt;

==== Governmental role ====
Moskowitz advocated for charter schools to be funded per pupil as fully as public noncharters are.&lt;ref name="todo"/&gt; She favored "a federal role in education.... especially in the area of parent choice"&lt;ref name="FedsCanUrge"&gt;[http://www.redefinedonline.org/2012/08/moskowitz-feds-can-urge-the-nation-to-think-bigger-be-bolder-move-faster/#more-7632 Moskowitz, Eva S., ''Eva Moskowitz: Feds Can Urge the Nation to Think Bigger, Be Bolder, Move Faster'', in ''redefinED'', August 16, 2012], as accessed August 17, 2012 (opinion).&lt;/ref&gt; and thought that [[Barack Obama|President Obama]]'s offering substantial money contingent on charter-centered reforms brought "the fight out" into public view,&lt;ref name="Mitchell" /&gt; contributing to New York and some other states {{Nowrap|"lift[ing]&amp;nbsp;...}} caps on the creation of new charter schools".&lt;ref name="FedsCanUrge"/&gt;{{Efn|[[Charter school (New York)#Statewide cap on number of schools|Caps on the creation of new charter schools]], the maximum number that may be opened}}

==== Diversity ====
Moskowitz objected to "a tendency in the charter school movement to celebrate a lack of socio-economic diversity."&lt;ref name="Mitchell" /&gt; She said, "I think we need many more charters that have socio-economic integration. I also think that we need to get charter schools into more affluent districts because I think many middle-class and upper middle-class parents think their schools are better than they are&amp;nbsp;... their schools are very complacent."&lt;ref name="Mitchell"/&gt; She described New York City schools as "shockingly segregated", "most&amp;nbsp;... either more than 90 percent minority or less than 10 percent", with some schools, by offering dual-language or gifted-and-talented programs attracting white middle-class students while "overwhelmingly poor minority students" take general education, exhibiting "fake integration".&lt;ref name="SeekDiversityNewSchs-SchBk"&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/schoolbook/2012/08/16/seeking-real-diversity-in-new-schools/ Moskowitz, Eva, ''Seeking Real Diversity In New Schools'', in ''SchoolBook'' (''Viewpoint''), August 16, 2012, 1:14 p.m.], as accessed August 17, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; She added that the city's "racial and socio-economic segregation&amp;nbsp;... [is] hard to change", impeding efforts to make charter schools into neighborhood schools and still have diversity among students, but continued that "I think we will change it [the segregation] eventually because our program is so appealing to middle-class families."&lt;ref name="Mitchell" /&gt; However, she added, "whether people can put their racial discomforts aside, I do not know",&lt;ref name="Mitchell" /&gt; but later said "parents of all races and classes truly want diversity as long as it is also accompanied by academic excellence."&lt;ref name="SeekDiversityNewSchs-SchBk" /&gt;

==== Design of model ====
Moskowitz said that children's minds are "agile",&lt;ref name="Benjamin"/&gt;&lt;!--approximately 2 min 36 s from start to approx. 2 min 57 s--&gt; that the need is to raise intellectual standards after which "the kids will rise to our expectation",&lt;ref name="CharterParentsInvolved-Newsmax"&gt;[http://www.newsmax.com/US/moskowitz-success-academies-parent/2012/07/26/id/446726 Reske, Henry J., &amp; Katie Lotman, ''NYC Charter School Founder Requires Parents Get Involved'', in ''Newsmax.TV'', July 26, 2012, 8:46 p.m.], as accessed July 28, 2012 (including [http://www.newsmax.com/US/moskowitz-success-academies-parent/2012/07/26/id/446726#ooid=x1bHZoNTqE0n4iUpzLif62dnREPVviuk video], accessed July 28, 2012).&lt;/ref&gt; and that "to raise the rigor bar" doesn't cost money.&lt;ref name="CharterParentsInvolved-Newsmax" /&gt;

Moskowitz argued that, although replication is "difficult",&lt;ref name="Mitchell" /&gt; "educational opportunity&amp;nbsp;... [is not] rocket science".&lt;ref name="NYView-WABCTV-2010-444529"&gt;[http://cdn.abclocal.go.com/wabc/video?id=7512949 Rosato, Ken, host, ''New York Viewpoint'', on WABC-TV, New York, N.Y., July 25, 2010, part 3 (video)], as accessed June 16, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--approximately 4 min 44 s from start to approx. 5 min 29 s--&gt; Part of success was "old-fashioned parental involvement.... It has to be a partnership between parents and the school."&lt;ref name="NYView-WABCTV-2010-444529" /&gt; Another was reading. She said, "our children read constantly."&lt;ref name="NYView-WABCTV-2010-444529" /&gt; She said, "and the third ingredient is high-quality teaching. We have to have the very best in our school system and we have to invest in teachers so that they can get better."&lt;ref name="NYView-WABCTV-2010-444529" /&gt; She favored modernization, rigor, accountability, "highly effective teacher[s,] and&amp;nbsp;... highly effective principal[s]".&lt;ref name="Bartiromo" /&gt; She argued for teachers and school leaders to have more flexibility to innovate in classrooms.&lt;ref name="todo"/&gt; She advocated for principals to be able to hire and fire teachers and to attract the best teachers.&lt;ref name="todo"/&gt; She supported decentralization in favor of teachers.&lt;ref name="Barker_Johnson"&gt;Barker, Cyril Josh, &amp; Stephon Johnson, ''Charter Schools in Uncharted Waters'', in ''N.Y. Amsterdam News'', vol. 102, no. 27, July 7–13, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; She called for more disclosure and increasing principals' accountability.&lt;ref name="PutToTestLocalDip-AmNews-p1"&gt;Mfuni, Tanangachi, ''Put to the Test: Most Blacks, Hispanics Graduate with Local, Not Regents Diploma'', in ''N.Y. Amsterdam News'', vol. 96, issue 27, June 30–July 6, 2005, p.&amp;nbsp;1.&lt;/ref&gt; She said, "what you want to teach kids is to think critically, mathematically, scientifically. You want them to be great writers."&lt;ref name="Bartiromo" /&gt; According to [[Nat Hentoff]], when Moskowitz was a City Councilmember she argued for education in civics, on how government works.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.villagevoice.com/2006-04-18/news/learning-why-we-re-americans/ Hentoff, Nat, ''Learning Why We're Americans'', in ''The Village Voice'' (New York, N.Y.), April 18, 2006, p.&amp;nbsp;1 (online)], as accessed June 2, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

She argued that class sizes should be reconsidered and that allowing a few more students in a class may help in educating the students while being economical.&lt;ref name="Conan"&gt;[https://www.npr.org/2011/03/29/134956184/school-founder-says-class-size-doesnt-matter Conan, Neal, host, ''School Founder Says Class Size Doesn't Matter'', on ''Talk of the Nation'' (NPR News) (National Public Radio), March 29, 2011], as accessed May 25, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; She argued that, when a school is funded on the basis of how many students it has, a larger class size may allow paying the teacher "exceedingly well"&lt;ref name="Conan"/&gt; and having "really talented" principals,&lt;ref name="Conan"/&gt;&lt;ref name="cost"&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/the-cost-of-small-class-size/2011/03/03/AFPGSkkB_story.html Moskowitz, Eva, ''The Cost of Small Class Size'', in ''The Washington Post'', March 27, 2011 (opinion)], as accessed May 19, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; business managers so principals focus on instructional matters, more supplies and field trips for students and teachers, computers and [[e-book]]s for students, more professional development, more tutoring, and more teaching staff, such as assistant teachers.&lt;ref name="Conan"/&gt;&lt;ref name="cost"/&gt; She said that students having computers and online books leads to their reading more books.&lt;ref name="Conan" /&gt;&lt;ref name="cost"/&gt; On the other hand, she agreed that a too-large class would be "absurd."&lt;ref name="Conan" /&gt; Overall, she posited that class size is a factor in students' success.&lt;ref name="cost"/&gt;

She believed schools were responsible for safety, so that, when [[Murder of Nixzmary Brown|Nixzmary Brown]] died (largely due to Brown's parents) after substantial absence from school, Moskowitz said that the child's school was minimally compliant with rules, if that, and did not do enough for the child's safety and therefore for the child's education.&lt;ref&gt;Moorer, Talise D., ''ACS Shakeup Skims Surface of Deeper Problem, Part 3'', in ''N.Y. Amsterdam News'', vol. 97, issue 8, February 16–22, 2006, p.&amp;nbsp;3.&lt;/ref&gt;

===== ''Mission Possible'', 2012 =====
In ''Mission Possible'' (2012), which Moskowitz cowrote, according to Hanlon Moskowitz argued for the importance of charter schools because public noncharter education "never put[s] the customer first"&lt;ref name="LimitMoskowitzModelUntilMayor-CapNY" /&gt; and fails to "boost productivity and innovate."&lt;ref name="LimitMoskowitzModelUntilMayor-CapNY" /&gt; Hanlon said, "most of the book is a pedagogical how-to".&lt;ref name="LimitMoskowitzModelUntilMayor-CapNY" /&gt;

==== Liberalism and personal role ====
Among Moskowitz's personal views relevant to education, according to Lisa M. Collins Moskowitz "says social justice drives her"&lt;ref&gt;[http://southbrooklynpost.com/2011/12/success-academy-charter-cobble-hll/ Collins, Lisa M., ''Charter War Cobble Hill'', in ''South Brooklyn Post'', December 20, 2011], as accessed June 1, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; and, according to Coplon, Moskowitz said "really fundamental to social justice&amp;nbsp;... [is] to have choices in life."&lt;ref name="Coplon"/&gt; According to [[Rich Lowry]] in the conservative ''[[National Review]]'', Moskowitz is a liberal.&lt;ref&gt;"''National Review'' [is]&amp;nbsp;... the bible of American conservatism": Hari, Johann, ''Titanic: Reshuffling the Deck Chairs on the National Review Cruise'', in ''The New Republic'', vol. 237, issue 1, July 2, 2007 (in ''MasterFile Premier'' (EbscoHost) (PDF) (subscription may be required)), p.&amp;nbsp;31.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Lowry"&gt;[http://www.nationalreview.com/articles/229957/revolt-against-blob/rich-lowry# Lowry, Rich, ''Revolt Against the Blob'', in ''National Review'', June 15, 2010, 12:00 a.m.], as accessed June 23, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Moskowitz described herself as "controversial".&lt;ref name="Mitchell"/&gt;&lt;!--approximately 3 min 10 s from start to approx. 3 min 22 s--&gt;

=== Opposition ===
Moskowitz in 2010 said that the chief opponent of charters like hers was "the union-political-educational complex", "the teachers' union and the elected officials&amp;nbsp;.... [who] together can&amp;nbsp;... stop you from doing a lot of&amp;nbsp;... good things for kids."&lt;ref name="NYView-WABCTV-2010-444529"/&gt;&lt;!--approximately 1 min 10 s from start to approx. 1 min 25 s--&gt; She argued that charters are more threatening than when they began, partly because there are more charters, even given that not all charters are good.&lt;ref name="Mitchell"/&gt;

According to Winnie Hu in 2004, Moskowitz's staff turnover was substantial, she expected them to work hours not limited to "government hours", and she provided them with [[BlackBerry]] wireless devices when not all Councilmembers had them.&lt;ref name="Hu"/&gt; According to Alex Mindlin, one student starting as a volunteer continued with Moskowitz for 5 years, including as a constituent liaison, organizing campaign letter-writing, and coordinating 75 volunteer petitioners.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2005/09/18/nyregion/thecity/18feat.html?pagewanted=all Mindlin, Alex, ''Peach-Fuzz Pols'', in ''N.Y.

=== Issues ===

==== Education ====
According to Hu, in 2003–2004, Moskowitz, with an "aggressive, confrontational style",&lt;ref name="Hu"/&gt; had "emerged as one of the most influential [Council] members&amp;nbsp;..., largely by parlaying her role as head of the Education Committee into a crusade for the city's troubled public schools."&lt;ref name="Hu"/&gt; According to Jonathan P. Hicks, she was "considered an expert in the Council on education issues".&lt;ref name="Hicks_050907"/&gt; In 2004, according to Hu, Moskowitz had "many" critics&lt;ref name="Hu"/&gt; and city schools then-chancellor [[Joel Klein]] described her as "tough-minded" and "determined";&lt;ref name="Hu"/&gt; according to Coplon, in an undated comment Klein said Moskowitz was "up there in the top five ["thorns in his side"], or the top three";&lt;ref name="Coplon"/&gt; and, according to Hu, in 2004, Miller described her as "a very determined person and very focused, and sometimes that determination can rub people the wrong way".&lt;ref name="Hu"/&gt; According to Michael Winerip, in 2005, Moskowitz "has been one of the few checks on the school system under mayoral control and said it was often a battle getting information and sometimes required a subpoena"&lt;ref name="KeepSpecEdRadar-NYT"&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2005/10/19/education/19education.html?pagewanted=all Winerip, Michael, ''Keeping Special Ed on the Radar'', in ''N.Y. Times'', October 19, 2005], as accessed February 23, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; and, according to Coplon and Lizzy Ratner, Moskowitz was known as an aggressive advocate for education reform.&lt;ref name="Coplon"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ratner"/&gt;

Also in 2005, wrote Susan Saulny, Moskowitz said "science education&amp;nbsp;... has been treated with second-class status for decades"&lt;ref name="SciChSchNYFail-NYT"&gt;[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C03EFD9123EF932A25752C1A9639C8B63 Saulny, Susan, ''Science Chief Says Schools In New York Are Failing'', in ''N.Y.

Moskowitz held hearings in 2003 on the teachers' union contracts, which, according to Hu, "landed&amp;nbsp;... [Moskowitz] in the headlines for weeks"&lt;ref name="Hu"/&gt; and, according to Ratner, "attracted reporters and produced headlines."&lt;ref name="Ratner"/&gt; Moskowitz also criticized contracts with principals and custodians.&lt;ref name="Lowry"/&gt; According to Williams, Moskowitz's "public hearings on the impact of work rules and job protections for teachers, principals, and custodians&amp;nbsp;... [showed] that it took far too long to unload incompetent employees from the system"&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Williams|2005|p=87}} and see pp.&amp;nbsp;100, 125, &amp; 258.&lt;/ref&gt; and that "other rules were silly and counterproductive", namely some for custodians.&lt;ref name="CheatOurKids-p87"&gt;{{harvp|Williams|2005|p=87}}&lt;/ref&gt; Williams said Moskowitz's "hearings attracted hoards [''sic''] of reporters and columnists"&lt;ref name="CheatOurKids-p87" /&gt; and that the then-president of the UFT, [[Randi Weingarten|Weingarten]], "furious"&lt;ref name="CheatOurKids-p88"&gt;{{harvp|Williams|2005|p=88}}&lt;/ref&gt; that the Council leadership had even permitted the hearings,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Williams|2005|pp=87–88}} and see pp.&amp;nbsp;88–89 (efforts to limit hearings).&lt;/ref&gt; testified with an "often caustic exchange" with Moskowitz.&lt;ref name="CheatOurKids-p88" /&gt; A secret list of witnesses was known to the UFT, some witnesses testified only after their identities were concealed, and some others refused to testify after agreeing to, according to Williams.&lt;ref name="CheatOurKids-p88" /&gt; "At the time, Moskowitz was the only Democratic official in New York City who was elected without the UFT's endorsement", wrote Williams,&lt;ref name="CheatOurKids-p88" /&gt; who also reported that Moskowitz was privately warned that the hearings could end her political career&lt;ref name="CheatOurKids-p89"&gt;{{harvp|Williams|2005|p=89}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that she recognized that winning citywide office in the future would be easier if she was supported and not opposed by the union.&lt;ref name="CheatOurKids-p90" /&gt; Miller, then the Council [[speaker (politics)|speaker]], let Moskowitz go forward with the hearings,&lt;ref name="CheatOurKids-p89" /&gt; [[Brian McLaughlin (politician)|Brian McLaughlin]], leader of the New York City [[AFL–CIO#State and local bodies|Central Labor Council]], opposed them,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Williams|2005|pp=88–89}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Bloomberg went from calling Moskowitz a "gadfly" the night before the hearings&lt;ref name="CheatOurKids-p89" /&gt; to praising her courage and criticizing her critics who were Council colleagues, according to Williams.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Williams|2005|pp=89–90}} (Williams said "praised her courage").&lt;/ref&gt; There was an effort to replace Moskowitz as committee chair, said Williams,&lt;ref name="CheatOurKids-p89"/&gt; but she served her full term.&lt;ref name="Kolodner"/&gt;

She also held hearings on the seeming absence of toilet paper.&lt;ref name="SchChHandPol" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Coplon"/&gt; She reported many parents' complaints about toilets being dirty, broken, or closed citywide and her own experience as a high school student with having to go across the street to a medical facility.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2004/01/29/nyregion/dirty-and-broken-bathrooms-make-for-a-long-school-day.html Gootman, Elissa, ''Dirty and Broken Bathrooms Make for a Long School Day'', in ''N.Y. Times'', January 29, 2004], as accessed February 21, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Hicks, Moskowitz was the "author of a law, passed&amp;nbsp;... over&amp;nbsp;... Bloomberg's veto, that holds the School Construction Authority accountable for delays and budget overruns."&lt;ref name="Hicks_050907"/&gt;{{Efn|[[New York City School Construction Authority|School Construction Authority]], a New York City government agency responsible for school construction}}

==== Other ====
According to Hu, in ''ca.'' 2002–2004 Moskowitz wrote six laws, including on health care and campaign finance reform.&lt;ref name="Hu"/&gt;

According to the ''[[New York Times]]'''s Kelly Crow, in 2002, in response to public housing tenants' security concerns at the [[Isaacs Houses|Stanley Isaacs Houses]], Moskowitz arranged for funding for cameras but the money was never spent by the city, and the police offered more patrols but said crime was worse uptown.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2002/11/10/nyregion/neighborhood-report-upper-east-side-with-affluence-all-around-little-crime-seems.html ''Neighborhood Report: Upper East Side; With Affluence All Around, A Little Crime Seems a Lot'', in ''The New York Times'', November 10, 2002], as accessed February 21, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

The next year, Moskowitz introduced a [[gun control]] bill.&lt;ref name="Hu"/&gt;

She introduced a bill to require [[baby diaper-changing station]]s in some buildings, at pools, and in parks and a bill to ban the sale and installing of audible car alarms.&lt;ref&gt;Diaper-changing stations: [https://www.nytimes.com/2002/09/21/nyregion/change-air-city-hall-bill-would-require-diapering-stations-public-places.html Cardwell, Diane, ''Change Is in the Air at City Hall; Bill Would Require Diapering Stations in Public Places'', in ''N.Y.

== Campaigns ==

=== Borough President primary campaign ===
In 2005, Moskowitz decided not to run again for the Council and entered the race for the Democratic party nomination to be the Manhattan Borough President to succeed [[C. Virginia Fields]],&lt;ref name="Cooper"&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2005/09/14/nyregion/metrocampaigns/14manhattan.html Cooper, Michael, ''Scott Stringer Wins a Crowded Primary and a Likely Election as Borough President'', in ''N.Y. Times'', September 14, 2005], as accessed February 21, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; according to Hicks emphasizing education and transportation issues.&lt;ref name="Hicks_050907"/&gt; The teachers' union campaigned heavily for [[Scott Stringer]] and against Moskowitz, based on Moskowitz's hearings about the teachers' contract and on other education issues, and so did the [[Working Families Party]].&lt;ref name="Cooper"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2011/06/the-failure-of-american-schools/8497/?single_page=true Klein, Joel, ''The Failure of American Schools'', in ''The Atlantic''], as accessed May 19, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Francis Barry, the Working Families Party spent most of the approximately $100,000 it spent on the race "to attack&amp;nbsp;... Moskowitz, who had made her name by challenging the teachers' union."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Barry|2009|p=235}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moskowitz raised almost $1 million and qualified for another $600,000 in city matching funds during the campaign, according to Hicks.&lt;ref name="Hicks_050907"/&gt; Ultimately, Moskowitz raised the most money of any Democratic candidate, but finished second to Stringer.&lt;ref name="Hicks_050914"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Cooper"/&gt;
Moskowitz ran on a platform of improving education options and opposing MTA subway and bus fare hikes, and adopted campaign rhetoric about inequality reminiscent of Bill de Blasio's 2013 bid for mayor.
"Our borough has become a place of the haves and the have-nots," Moskowitz was quoted as saying during her campaign kickoff on the City Hall steps in February 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.capitalnewyork.com/article/city-hall/2015/09/8576136/eva-moskowitz-practiced-de-blasio-foe-weighs-mayoral-challenge|title=Eva Moskowitz, practiced de Blasio foe, weighs a mayoral challenge|publisher=|accessdate=2 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Mayoralty ===
In 2005, Moskowitz endorsed Bloomberg for Mayor.&lt;ref name="BackClass-NYJewishWk" /&gt; In 2010, she credited Bloomberg and his appointee Klein as schools chancellor with education improvements.&lt;ref name="todo"/&gt;

Moskowitz stated her intention to run for [[Mayor of New York]],&lt;ref name="Eichna"/&gt; with, she said in 2012, a "70 to 80 percent chance"&lt;ref name="LimitMoskowitzModelUntilMayor-CapNY" /&gt; she will run in 2017.&lt;ref name="LimitMoskowitzModelUntilMayor-CapNY"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Lisa Fleisher |date=June 26, 2012 |title=Eva Moskowitz Delays a Run for Mayor |publisher=[[The Wall Street Journal]] |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702303640804577491272837590462}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://politicker.com/2012/07/moskowitz-if-bill-de-blasio-becomes-mayor-what-is-he-going-to-do/ Campbell, Colin, ''Moskowitz: 'If Bill de Blasio Becomes Mayor, What Is He Going to Do?&amp;#39;'', in ''Politicker'', July 4, &amp;#91;2012&amp;#93;, 9:48 a.m.], as accessed July 24 &amp; 25, 2012 (single quotation marks in headline so in original).&lt;/ref&gt;

== Historian ==

=== ''In Therapy We Trust'', 2001 ===
Moskowitz wrote the book, ''In Therapy We Trust''. According to [[Jesse Eisinger]], Moskowitz identified "three tenets: happiness is the supreme goal, problems stem from psychological causes, and those psychological problems are treatable"&lt;ref name="TradeGoldmanJourneySelfImprove-NYT"&gt;[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D06E2DE153FF933A15752C0A9679D8B63 Eisinger, Jesse, ''The Trade: Goldman's Journey to Self-Improvement'', in ''N.Y. Times'', January 20, 2011 (online)], as accessed June 7, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; and labeled this set "the therapeutic gospel, a doctrine so ingrained in American society that few of us consciously recognize it".&lt;ref name="TradeGoldmanJourneySelfImprove-NYT" /&gt;

In the book, Moskowitz made several points: "We are&amp;nbsp;... bound together by a gospel of psychological happiness.... Americans turn to psychological cures as reflexively as they once turned to God. But our relationship to the psyche appears to have exceeded that of believers and become more like that of cult members."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Moskowitz|2001|p=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reformers recommended hiring "visiting teachers" who would understand children&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Moskowitz|2001|p=52}}&lt;/ref&gt; when some school principals still believed in "more drill".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Moskowitz|2001|p=53}}&lt;/ref&gt; "The persistence of Americans' faith in psychological happiness is troubling.... Rather than offering real psychological insight, these cures are vapid therapies. There is little rigorous psychological thinking in our culture."&lt;ref name="InTherapyWeTrust-p283"&gt;{{harvp|Moskowitz|2001|p=283}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Psychological interpretations tend to crowd out social, economic, and political ones."&lt;ref name="InTherapyWeTrust-p284"&gt;{{harvp|Moskowitz|2001|p=284}}&lt;/ref&gt; "While I have no argument with psychological contentment as an important standard for individuals and no argument with in-depth psychological investigation as a means, when a whole society makes happiness and self-realization its rallying cry, clearly something is lost in the process."&lt;ref name="InTherapyWeTrust-p283" /&gt;

=== Documentary, study, and protest ===
Moskowitz directed and produced a 1997 [[documentary]] on women's roles after [[World War II]].&lt;ref name="InTherapyWeTrust-opcit-jktrearflap"&gt;{{harvp|Moskowitz|2001|loc=dust jacket, rear flap}}&lt;/ref&gt; The VHS-only video ''Some Spirit in Me'' (1993) was written, produced, and directed by Moskowitz.&lt;ref name="SomeSpiritMe-WorldCat"&gt;[http://www.worldcat.org/title/some-spirit-in-me/oclc/38915965&amp;referer=brief_results ''Some Spirit in Me'', OCLC 38915965, in ''WorldCat''], as accessed September 5, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

Moskowitz wrote a scholarly study of [[Betty Friedan]]'s work.&lt;ref name="Goodtoblow"/&gt;

== Criticisms ==
Moskowitz has faced criticism for closing her schools so that students and parents may participate in political protests, and providing free transportation to a protest rally outside the State Capital in Albany.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Carpenter |first1=Zoë |title=Were Charter Teachers and Students Pressured to Rally for Charter Schools in Albany? |url=http://www.thenation.com/blog/178844/were-charter-teachers-and-students-pressured-rally-charter-schools-albany# |publisher=The Nation |accessdate=10 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ny.chalkbeat.org"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Cramer |first1=Philissa |title=DEVELOPING STORY Repost This Article 152 Reprising 2012 rally, charter advocates planning march for Oct. 8 |url=http://ny.chalkbeat.org/2013/09/23/reprising-2012-rally-charter-advocates-planning-march-for-oct-8/ |publisher=The Chalkbeat |accessdate=10 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2013, during his campaign for Mayor of New York, [[Bill de Blasio]] criticized Moskowitz's Success Academy Charter Schools for using public-school space without paying rent.&lt;ref name="ny.chalkbeat.org"/&gt; During an interview at the "Save our Schools" rally in Washington D.C., actor Matt Damon said of collocation: "Eva Moskowitz just spent $1.7 million in advertising, as in marketing for her[self] ... [this] kind of core inequality has to be addressed." Damon was citing a New York ''Daily News'' article in which the actual figure was $1.6 million, a sum that has been disputed by a spokeswoman for the Success Network.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Decker |first1=Geoff |title=Matt Damon criticizes Eva Moskowitz's charters at D.C. rally |url=http://ny.chalkbeat.org/2011/08/01/matt-damon-criticizes-eva-moskowitzs-charters-at-d-c-rally/#.U6rN8_SwKY0 |website=Chalkbeat New York |accessdate=25 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, critics have pointed out that in her dispute with Mayor de Blasio regarding collocation, her organization's expansion into a public school in Harlem would have displaced students there with disabilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Ravitch |first1=Diane |title=New York Schools: The Roar of the Charters |url=http://www.nybooks.com/blogs/nyrblog/2014/mar/27/new-york-charters-against-deblasio/ |publisher=The New York Review of Books |accessdate=25 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Protests and legal disputes involving Moskowitz and Success Academy Charter Schools are depicted in the pro-charter school film "The Lottery," as well as the critical documentary "The Inconvenient Truth Behind Waiting for Superman."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://commons.trincoll.edu/edreform/2013/02/an-analysis-of-the-lottery/|title=An Analysis of The Lottery – Educ 300: Education Reform, Past and Present|website=commons.trincoll.edu|accessdate=2 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/05/24/inconvenient-truth-behind-waiting-for-superman_n_865962.html|title=NYC Teachers Counter 'Waiting For Superman' With Film Of Their Own|first=Joy|last=Resmovits|date=25 May 2011|publisher=|accessdate=2 February 2018|via=Huff Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Moskowitz has been criticized by education historian and former Deputy Secretary of Education [[Diane Ravitch]] on numerous occasions, including interviews, op-eds, and on her education blog.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Ravitch |first1=Diane |title=Moskowitz "Success Academy" Sues to Block Audit |url=http://dianeravitch.net/2013/07/11/moskowitz-success-academy-sues-to-block-state-audit/ |website=Diane Ravitch's Blog |accessdate=25 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Ravitch |first1=Diane |title=Mayor de Blasio and Education: Fact-Checking Eva Moskowitz's Claims Diane Ravitch in The Huffington Post |url=http://www.networkforpubliceducation.org/news/mayor-de-blasio-and-education-fact-checking-eva-moskowitzs-claims-diane-ravitch-in-the-huffington-post/ |website=Network for Public Education |accessdate=25 June 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140422234602/http://www.networkforpubliceducation.org/news/mayor-de-blasio-and-education-fact-checking-eva-moskowitzs-claims-diane-ravitch-in-the-huffington-post/ |archivedate=22 April 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Criticisms have been leveled at Moskowitz's record educating low-performing, English-language learning, and disabled students. English-language learners are significantly underrepresented at Success, and critics have charged that some lower-grade children eligible for government-mandated [[special education]] accommodation, or IEPs, have been withdrawn, effectively winnowing students before third grade, the year state testing begins.&lt;ref name="Coplon"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Coplon |first1=Jeff |title=The Patron Saint (and Scourge) of Lost Schools |url=http://nymag.com/news/features/65614/index4.html |website=New York Magazine |accessdate=25 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Federal prominence ==

Moskowitz met with United States President-Elect Donald Trump on November 16, 2016 for a possible appointment in the Trump administration as [[United States Secretary of Education]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.politico.com/blogs/donald-trump-administration/2016/11/moskowitz-trump-education-secretary-231518|title=Possible Education pick Moskowitz meets with Trump|publisher=|accessdate=2 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Previous reporting noted that under Moskowitz, a Democrat, hedge fund manager [[John Paulson]], a major Trump ally, has provided Success an $8.5 million donation in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.politico.com/states/new-york/city-hall/story/2016/11/eva-moskowitz-officially-in-running-to-become-education-secretary-107398|title=Charter leader Eva Moskowitz in the mix for Trump education secretary|publisher=|accessdate=2 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There has been a large community of '''[[Greeks]] in [[Egypt]]''', also known as '''Egyptiotes''' ({{lang-el|Αιγυπτιώτες}}), from the [[Hellenistic period]] until the aftermath of the [[Egyptian revolution of 1952]], when most were forced to leave.

==Antiquity==
[[File:Greco-Egyptian - Aryballos - Walters 482863 - Three Quarter.jpg|thumb|Greco-Egyptian  Aryballos from the 6th century BC, [[Walters Art Museum]]]]
Greeks have been present in Egypt since at least the 7th century BC. [[Herodotus]] visited Egypt in the 5th century BC and claimed that the Greeks were one of the first groups of foreigners that ever lived in Egypt.&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.ana-mpa.gr/afieromata/omogeneia/africa/part_a.html Α΄ Η διαχρονική πορεία του ελληνισμού στην Αφρική&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://www.webcitation.org/6GrrhWO6Y?url=http://web.ana-mpa.gr/afieromata/omogeneia/africa/part_a.html |date=2013-05-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Diodorus Siculus]] claimed that [[Rhodes|Rhodian]] [[Actis (mythology)|Actis]], one of the [[Heliadae]], built the city of [[Heliopolis (Ancient Egypt)|Heliopolis]] before the [[Deluge (mythology)|cataclysm]]; likewise the [[Athenians]] built [[Sais]]. Siculus reports that all the Greek cities were destroyed during the cataclysm, but the Egyptian cities including Heliopolis and Sais survived.&lt;ref&gt;The Historical Library of Diodorus Siculus, [https://books.google.com/books?id=agd-eLVNRMMC&amp;printsec=titlepage#PPA336,M1 Book V,57].&lt;/ref&gt;

===First historical colonies===
According to [[Herodotus]] (ii. 154), King [[Psammetichus I]] (664–610 BC) established a garrison of foreign mercenaries at [[Daphnae]], mostly [[Caria]]ns and [[Ionia]]n Greeks.

In 7th century BC, after the [[Greek Dark Ages]] from 1100-750 BC, the city of [[Naucratis]] was founded in Ancient Egypt. It was located on the [[Canopus, Egypt|Canopic]] branch of the Nile river, 45&amp;nbsp;mi (72&amp;nbsp;km) from the open sea. It was the first and, for much of its early history, the only permanent Greek colony in Egypt; acting as a symbiotic nexus for the interchange of Greek and Egyptian art and culture.

At about the same time, the city of [[Heracleion]], the closest to the sea, became an important port for Greek trade. It had a famous temple of [[Heracles]]. The city later sank into the sea, only to be rediscovered recently.

From the time of [[Psammetichus I]] onwards, Greek mercenary armies played an important role in some of the Egyptian wars. One such army was led by [[Mentor of Rhodes]]. Another such personage was [[Phanes of Halicarnassus]].

===Hellenistic times===
{{main|History of Ptolemaic Egypt|Ptolemaic dynasty}}

====Rule of Alexander the Great (332–323 BC)====
[[File:Dendera Tempel 14.JPG|thumb|left|upright|[[Cleopatra VII]] along with her son [[Caesarion]] as [[Pharaoh]].]]
[[Alexander the Great]] conquered Egypt at an early stage of his conquests. He respected the pharaonic religions and customs and he was proclaimed [[Pharaoh]] of Egypt. He established the city of [[Alexandria]]. After his death, in 323 BC, his empire was divided among [[Diadochi|his generals]]. Egypt was given to [[Ptolemy I Soter]], whose descendants would give Egypt her final royal dynasty — a glittering one, largely Greek in flavor.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}} Its capital was Alexandria. Ptolemy added legitimacy to his rule in Egypt by acquiring Alexander's body. He intercepted the embalmed corpse on its way to burial, brought it to Egypt, and placed it in a golden coffin in Alexandria. It would remain one of the famous sights of the town for many years, until probably destroyed in riots in the 3rd century AD.&lt;ref name="abc"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.historyworld.net/wrldhis/PlainTextHistories.asp?groupid=260&amp;HistoryID=aa28|title=HISTORY OF EGYPT|website=www.historyworld.net|access-date=2018-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====The Ptolemaic dynasty (323–30 BC) ====
[[Image:Roman coin alexandria lighthouse.gif|left|thumb|Reverse of a [[tetradrachm]] featuring the [[Lighthouse of Alexandria]] from 189 BC]]

The initial objective of Ptolemy's reign was to establish firm and broad boundaries to his newly acquired kingdom. That led to almost continuous warfare against other leading members of Alexander's circle. At times he held [[Cyprus]] and even parts of mainland [[Greece]]. When these conflicts were over, he was firmly in control of Egypt and had strong claims (disputed by the [[Seleucid Empire|Seleucid dynasty]]) to [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]]. He called himself king of Egypt from 306 BC. By the time he abdicated in 285 BC, in favour of one of his sons, the [[Ptolemaic dynasty]] was secure. Ptolemy and his descendants showed respect to Egypt's most cherished traditions — those of religion — and turned them to their own advantage. Alexandria became the centre of the Greek and [[Hellenistic civilization|Hellenistic]] world and the centre of international commerce, art and science. The [[Lighthouse of Alexandria]] was one of the [[Seven Wonders of the Ancient World]] while during the reign of [[Ptolemy II Philadelphus]], the [[Library of Alexandria]] was the biggest library in the world until it was destroyed. The last Pharaoh was a Greek princess, [[Cleopatra VII]], who took her own life in 30 BC, a year after the [[battle of Actium]].&lt;ref name=abc/&gt;

===Roman and Byzantine Egypt===

Under Greco-Roman rule, Egypt hosted several [[Greeks|Greek]] settlements, mostly concentrated in [[Alexandria]], but also in a few other cities, where Greek settlers lived alongside some seven to ten million native [[Egyptians]].&lt;ref&gt;Adams, Winthrope L in Bugh, Glenn Richard. ed. "The Hellenistic Kingdoms". ''The Cambridge Companion to the Hellenistic World''. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. 2006, p. 39&lt;/ref&gt; [[Faiyum]]'s earliest Greek inhabitants were soldier-veterans and ''cleruchs'' (elite military officials) who were settled by the Ptolemaic kings on reclaimed lands.&lt;ref&gt;Stanwick, Paul Edmund. ''Portraits of the Ptolemies: Greek Kings as Egyptian Pharaohs.'' Austin: University of Texas Press. 2003, p. 23&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Adams, ''op cit.''&lt;/ref&gt; Native Egyptians also came to settle in Faiyum from all over the country, notably the [[Nile Delta]], [[Upper and Lower Egypt|Upper Egypt]], [[Oxyrhynchus]] and [[Memphis, Egypt|Memphis]], to undertake the labor involved in the land reclamation process, as attested by personal names, local cults and recovered [[papyrus|papyri]].&lt;ref&gt;Bagnall, R.S. in Susan Walker, ed. ''Ancient Faces : Mummy Portraits in Roman Egypt'' (Metropolitan Museum of Art Publications). New York: Routledge, 2000, p. 27&lt;/ref&gt; It is estimated that as much as 30 percent of the population of Faiyum was Greek during the [[Ptolemaic Egypt|Ptolemaic]] period, with the rest being native Egyptians.&lt;ref name="Bagnall, op cit."&gt;Bagnall, ''op cit.''&lt;/ref&gt; By the Roman period, much of the "Greek" population of Faiyum was made up of either Hellenized Egyptians or people of mixed Egyptian-Greek origins.&lt;ref&gt;Bagnall, pp. 28–29&lt;/ref&gt; By the time of Roman emperor [[Caracalla]] in the 2nd century CE, "genuine" ethnic Egyptians could be easily differentiated from Alexandria's Greeks "by their speech."&lt;ref&gt;qtd. in Alan K. Bowman, ''Egypt after the Pharaohs, 332 BC – AD 642'', Berkeley: University of California Press, 1996, p. 126: "genuine Egyptians can easily be recognized among the linen-weavers by their speech."&lt;/ref&gt;

While commonly believed to represent Greek settlers in Egypt,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.egyptologyonline.com/mummy_portraits.htm Egyptology Online: Fayoum mummy portraits] accessed on January 16, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-59912/Egyptian-art-and-architecture/ Encyclopædia Britannica Online - Egyptian art and architecture - Greco-Roman Egypt] accessed on January 16, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Fayum mummy portraits]] instead reflect the complex synthesis of the predominant Egyptian culture and that of the elite Greek minority in the city.&lt;ref name="Bagnall, op cit."/&gt; According to Walker, the early Ptolemaic Greek colonists married local women and adopted Egyptian religious beliefs, and by Roman times, their descendants were viewed as Egyptians by the Roman rulers, despite their own self-perception of being Greek.&lt;ref&gt;Walker, Susan, ''op cit.'', p. 24&lt;/ref&gt; The dental morphology&lt;ref&gt;Dentition helps archaeologists to assess biological and ethnic population traits and relationships&lt;/ref&gt; of the Roman-period Faiyum mummies was also compared with that of earlier Egyptian populations, and was found to be "much more closely akin" to that of ancient Egyptians than to Greeks or other European populations.&lt;ref&gt;Irish JD (2006). "Who were the ancient Egyptians? Dental affinities among Neolithic through postdynastic peoples.". ''Am J Phys Anthropol'' 129 (4): 529-43&lt;/ref&gt; Victor J. Katz notes that "research in papyri dating from the early centuries of the common era demonstrates that a significant amount of intermarriage took place between the Greek and Egyptian communities".&lt;ref name="Katz 184"&gt;Victor J. Katz (1998). ''A History of Mathematics: An Introduction'', p. 184. Addison Wesley, {{ISBN|0-321-01618-1}}: "''But what we really want to know is to what extent the Alexandrian mathematicians of the period from the first to the fifth centuries C.E. were Greek. Certainly, all of them wrote in Greek and were part of the Greek intellectual community of Alexandria. And most modern studies conclude that the Greek community coexisted [...] So should we assume that [[Ptolemy]] and [[Diophantus]], [[Pappus of Alexandria|Pappus]] and [[Hypatia]] were ethnically Greek, that their ancestors had come from Greece at some point in the past but had remained effectively isolated from the Egyptians? It is, of course, impossible to answer this question definitively. But research in papyri dating from the early centuries of the common era demonstrates that a significant amount of intermarriage took place between the Greek and Egyptian communities [...] And it is known that Greek marriage contracts increasingly came to resemble Egyptian ones. In addition, even from the founding of Alexandria, small numbers of Egyptians were admitted to the privileged classes in the city to fulfill numerous civic roles. Of course, it was essential in such cases for the Egyptians to become "Hellenized," to adopt Greek habits and the Greek language. Given that the Alexandrian mathematicians mentioned here were active several hundred years after the founding of the city, it would seem at least equally possible that they were ethnically Egyptian as that they remained ethnically Greek. In any case, it is unreasonable to portray them with purely European features when no physical descriptions exist.''"&lt;/ref&gt;

==Medieval Islamic and Ottoman era==
{{Off topic|date=February 2016}}
[[Image:Isma'il Raghib Pasha.jpg|thumb|right|[[Raghib Pasha]] (ca. 1819–1884) was a Greek convert to Islam who served as Prime Minister of Egypt.]]
Greek culture and political influence continued and perhaps reached its most influential times during the Ottoman Caliphate, which witnessed many Ottoman Sultans and Pashas of Greek ancestry rule over the Ottoman Empire in general, and Egypt in particular. Other notable Greeks in Egypt during the Ottoman period included [[Damat Hasan Pasha]] from the [[Morea]], a governor of Egypt. [[Raghib Pasha]], born in Greece to Greek parents, served as Prime Minister of Egypt. During the Ottoman Caliphate, [[Pargalı Ibrahim Pasha]], Grand Vizier to [[Suleiman the Magnificent]] from 1520–1566, is perhaps the best known.

Many [[Greek Muslims]] from Crete (often confusingly called [[Cretan Turks]]) were resettled in Egypt, Libya, Lebanon, and Syria by Sultan [[Abdul Hamid II]] after the [[Greco-Turkish War (1897)|Greco-Turkish War]] of 1897 that resulted in the [[Cretan State|autonomy of Crete]] (see the example of [[al-Hamidiyah]], a largely Cretan Greek Muslim village in Syria).

==Modern times==

===Greek community===
[[Image:Constantine Cavafy, ca 1900.jpg|thumb|[[Constantine P. Cavafy]]]]

In 1907, the census showed 62,973 Greeks living in Egypt. By 1940, Greeks numbered about 250,000. The Greek community in Alexandria lived around the church and [[convent]] of [[Sabbas the Sanctified]]. In the same area there was a guest house for Greek travelers, a Greek hospital and later a Greek school. The [[Greek Orthodox Church|Greek Orthodox]] bishop was based in [[Damietta]] in the church of [[Saint Nicholas|Nikolaos of Myrna]].

In [[Cairo]], the first organised Greek community was founded in 1856, with the community based in three main neighbourhoods: Tzouonia, Haret el Roum (Street of the Greeks), and in Hamzaoui. The patriarchate was based in [[Saint Mark's Coptic Orthodox Cathedral, Azbakeya]]. The monastery of [[Saint George]], in [[Old Cairo]] still survives. The monastery is surrounded by a huge wall and topped by a stone tower. Within its walls there was a Greek hospital, a school and housing for the elderly and poor.

In addition to the Greek communities of Alexandria and Cairo, there were the organised Greek communities of [[Mansoura, Egypt|Mansoura]], founded in 1860, [[Port Said]], founded in 1870, [[Tanta]] in 1880, and the community of [[Zagazig]] in 1850. There were fifteen smaller communities across Egypt and mainly around Cairo and Alexandria. In [[Upper Egypt]], the oldest ancient Greek community was the one of [[Minya, Egypt|Minia]] which was founded in 1812.

The first banks in Egypt were crafted by Greeks, including the [[Bank of Alexandria]], the Anglo-Egyptian bank (Sunadinos family / Συναδινός), and the General Bank of Alexandria. Also, it was the Greek agriculturists and farmers that first systematically and with scientific planning, cultivated [[cotton]] and [[tobacco]]. They improved the quantity and quality of production and dominated cotton and tobacco exports. Notable families in tobacco commerce were the Salvagos ({{lang|grc|Σαλβάγκος}}), Benakis ({{lang|grc|Μπενάκης}}), Rodochanakis ({{lang|grc|Ροδοχανάκης}}) and Zervoudachis ({{lang|grc|Ζερβουδάκης}}).&lt;ref name=ben&gt;[http://www.kathimerini.gr/4dcgi/_w_articles_kathglobal_2_12/02/2006_1285480 kathimerini.gr | Αιγυπτιώτης Eλληνισμός· κοιτίδα ευεργετισμού&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20130107165055/http://www.kathimerini.gr/4dcgi/_w_articles_kathglobal_2_12/02/2006_1285480 |date=2013-01-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The tobacco cultivars used for cigarette manufacturing, e.g., by [[Kyriazi Freres]], were of Greek origin. A thriving commerce between Greece and Egypt was thus established. Other areas of interest for the Greeks in Egypt were foods, wine, soap, wood crafts, printing.

In the food industry, the macaroni industries of Melachrinos ({{lang|grc|Μελαχροινός}}) and Antoniados ({{lang|grc|Αντωνιάδης}}) were well known. Another example was the cheese and butter production of Archyriou ({{lang|grc|Αργυρίου}}), Roussoglou (Ρ{{lang|grc|ουσσόγλου}}) and Paleoroutas ({{lang|grc|Παλαιορούτας}}). Chocolate-Biscuits and Toffee producers were: Daloghlou ({{lang|grc|Δαλόγλου}}), Russos ({{lang|grc|Ρούσσος}}), Repapis ({{lang|grc|Ρεπάπης}}); Oil-soaps-vegetable fats (Salt &amp; Soda) producers like Zerbinis ({{lang|grc|Ζερμπίνης}}) were based in Kafr al-Zayat. There were many Greek theatres and cinemas. Major Greek newspapers were ''Ta grammata'' ({{lang|grc|Τα Γράμματα}}), "Tahidromos"({{lang|grc|Ταχυδρόμος}}), and ''Nea Zoi'' ({{lang|grc|Νέα Ζωή}}).&lt;ref&gt;[http://noctoc-noctoc.blogspot.com/2007/06/greeks-of-egypt.html Noctoc: The Greeks Of Egypt-Οι Ελληνεσ Της Αιγυπτου-اليونانيون في مصر&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The Greek community in Egypt has produced numerous artists, writers, diplomats and politicians, the most famous being the poet [[Constantine P. Cavafy]] ({{lang|grc|Κωνσταντίνος Καβάφης}}), also the painter [[Konstantinos Parthenis]] ({{lang|grc|Κωνσταντίνος Παρθένης}}).

During the [[Balkan Wars]], the Greek communities of Egypt sent volunteers, funded hospitals, and accommodated families of the soldiers. During [[World War II]] (1940–1945), more than 7000 Greeks fought for the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] in the [[Middle East]]; 142 died. Their financial contribution reached 2500 million Egyptian pounds.&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.ana-mpa.gr/afieromata/omogeneia/africa/part_b/war.htm Η προσφορά του Ελληνισμού της Αιγύπτου στο Β΄Παγκόσμιο Πόλεμο&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927215403/http://web.ana-mpa.gr/afieromata/omogeneia/africa/part_b/war.htm |date=2007-09-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt; After the [[Suez Crisis]], the [[British people|British]] and [[French people|French]] laborers left while the Greeks stayed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.neo.gr/website/ergasiamathiti/12.htm|title=Αρχαία Αίγυπτος|website=www.neo.gr|access-date=2018-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Patriarchate of Alexandria===

===Greek-Egyptian benefactors===
[[Image:1896 Olympic tennis.jpg|thumb|[[Dionysios Kasdaglis]], ethnic Greek Egyptian tennis player at the [[1896 Summer Olympics|Athens Olympics in 1896]]]]

The emergence of a Greek aristocracy of rich industrialists, commercants and bankers created the legacy of Greek-Egyptian philanthropism. These benefactors donated large amounts for the building of schools, academies, hospitals and institutions in both Egypt and Greece. [[Michail Tositsas]] donated large amounts for the building of the [[National and Kapodistrian University of Athens|Athens University]], the Amalio Orphanage and the [[Athens Polytechnic]]. His wife Eleni Tositsa donated the land for the [[National Archaeological Museum of Athens]]. [[George Averoff]] also contributed to the building of the [[National Technical University of Athens]], the [[Hellenic Military Academy|Evelpidon Military Academy]] and the donation of the cruiser [[Greek cruiser Georgios Averoff|''Averoff'']] to the [[Hellenic Navy]]. [[Emmanouil Benakis]] contributed to the building of the [[National Gallery (Athens)|National Gallery of Athens]], while his son [[Antonis Benakis]] was the founder of the [[Benaki Museum]]. Other major benefactors include Nikolaos Stournaras, Theodoros Kotsikas, Nestoras Tsanaklis, Konstantinos Horemis, Stefanos Delta, [[Penelope Delta]], Pantazis Vassanis and Vassilis Sivitanidis.&lt;ref name=ben/&gt;

===Exodus===
The exodus of Greeks from Egypt started before the [[Egyptian Revolution of 1952|revolution of 1952]]. With the establishment of the new sovereign regime of [[Gamal Abdel Nasser]], rise of [[Pan-Arab nationalism]], and the subsequent nationalisation of many industries in 1961 and 1963, thousands of Greek employees decided to abandon the country. Many of them emigrated to [[Australia]], the [[United States]], Canada, South Africa, Western Europe, and Greece. Many Greek schools, churches, small communities and institutions subsequently closed, but many continue to function to this day. The Nasser regime saw a big exodus of the Greeks from Egypt, but most of the minority left the country either before or after the period 1952-1970. The Arab-Israeli wars of 1956 and 1967 contributed to the uprooting of the sizeable Greek community in the Suez Canal cities, especially Port Said.

===Today===
Today the Greek community numbers officially about 5,000 people&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://foreignpolicy.com/2014/12/23/lighthouse-dims-egypt-alexandria-salafists-mubarak-sisi-longform/|title=The Lighthouse Dims|website=Foreign Policy|language=en|access-date=2018-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; although many of Greek origin are now counted as Egyptian, having changed their nationality. In Alexandria, apart from the Patriarchate, there is a Patriarchal theology school that opened recently after 480 years being closed. Saint Nicholas church in Cairo and several other buildings in Alexandria have been recently renovated by the [[Politics of Greece|Greek Government]] and the [[Alexander S. Onassis Foundation]]. Saint George's church in Old Cairo is undergoing restoration to end in 2014. During the last decade, there has been a new interest from the Egyptian government for a diplomatic rapprochement with Greece and this has positively affected the Greek Diaspora. The Diaspora has received official visits of many Greek politicians.  Economic relationships between Greece and Egypt have expanded.  As of 2010, Egypt has received major Greek investments in banking, tourism, paper, the oil industry, &amp; many others. In 2009, a five-year cooperation-memorandum was signed among the [[NCSR Demokritos]] Institute in [[Agia Paraskevi]], [[Athens]] and the University of Alexandria, regarding [[Archeometry]] research and contextual sectors.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.demokritos.gr/deltia_det.asp?deltio_id=116 Cooperation memorandum signed among NCSR D and Alexandria University, Egypt] 29/1/2009, retrieved on 31/1/2009&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notable Greeks from Egypt==
Greeks of [[Cyrene, Libya|Cyrene]] (the [[Cyrenaica]] is a region corresponding to modern eastern [[Libya]]) are also included, as during antiquity it held close relations to the Egyptian kingdoms, and at some points, also used to be a part of the [[Ptolemaic kingdom]]. The presence of an asterisk (*) next to a person's name denotes that the person was born outside of Egypt, however the most part of this person's life or most important work occurred while in Egypt.

7th - 19th century &lt;ref&gt;While creating the table entries, it was very hard to find any details for Greeks in Egypt during the Arab and later Ottoman period. This may be due to the Islamic practice where the subjects of a kingdom adopt Islamic names, thus making it hard to distinguish nationality by name. With the French and English interventions in Egypt during the 18th and 19th century, the first Greek organised communities arise, giving a lot of information about Greek Egyptians of this era.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Guan people''' are an [[ethnic group]] found almost in all parts of [[Ghana]], including the [[Gonja people|Gonja]], [[Anum people|Anum]], [[Larteh people|Larteh]], [[Nawuri]], and [[Chumburu]], whose ancestors founded the [[Gonja people|Gonja state]]. They primarily speak the [[Guang languages]] of the Niger-Congo language family.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/247767/Guan|title=Guan |work=britannica.com|publisher=[[Encyclopædia Britannica Online]] |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Guans are believed to be the first settlers in the modern day Ghana that migrated from the Mossi region of modern Burkina around 1000 A.D.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/tribes/guan.php&lt;/ref&gt;  They are scattered across all the regions in Ghana. Guans speak distinct languages which are different from the major languages in Ghana except Gonja. However, some of these Guan languages are influenced by major languages in Ghana, depending on where a particular Guang tribe is located.  Guans in the Eastern region include [[Anum people|Anum]], Boso, Larteh, Okere, and Kyerepong. Guans in the Volta Region include Akpafu/Lolobi, Buem, Nkonya, Likpe, Logba, Amedzofe, etc. In the central region we have the [[Efutu people|Efutu]], Awutu and Senya in Winneba and Bawjiase areas. The Gonja people are in the North and part of Brong Ahafo. Guans being the first settlers in Ghana, some were assimilated into the cultures of the major ethnic groups in the various regions we have today. Thus, some indigenes of Kpeshie in Greater Accra and Nzema, Sefwi, Ahanta etc. in the Western region may also trace their roots to Guans. The indigenes of most of the Fantes in the central region including Asebu, Edna, Aguafo etc. as well as Agona can also trace their origins from Guans. At present it is accepted that the Guan people can be found in five regions in Ghana: Volta, Northern, Central, Eastern, and Brong Ahafo Regions.They are very tolerant and live as commoners in their various environment. They speak the languages of the major ethnic group where they are found natively and speak their distinct languages at home.

'''Gungnyeo''' (literally "palace women")&lt;ref name="Han, Hee-sook"&gt;Han, Hee-sook, pp. 141–146&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[Korea]]n term referring to women waiting on the king and other royalty in traditional [[Korean society]]. It is short for "gungjung yeogwan", which translates as "a lady officer of the royal court".&lt;ref name="KTO"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://asiaenglish.visitkorea.or.kr/ena/SI/SI_EN_3_6.jsp?cid=309521 |title=Korean Food Culture Series – Part 5; Royal Cuisine – Who made royal cuisines? |publisher=[[Korea Tourism Organization]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Gungnyeo'' includes ''[[sanggung]]'' (palace matron)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aks.ac.kr/glossary/glossary_detail.asp?g_code=15278&amp;page=1&amp;c_code=&amp;search_field=g_korean&amp;keyword=%EC%83%81%EA%B6%81&amp;order=g_korean&amp;kanada= |title=상궁(尙宮), Sanggung |publisher=[[The Academy of Korean Studies]] |language=Korean, English}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''nain'' (assistant court ladies), both of which hold rank as officers. The term is also used more broadly to encompass women in a lower class without a rank such as ''[[musuri]]'' (lowest maids in charge of odd chores), ''gaksimi'', ''sonnim'', ''[[uinyeo]]'' (female physicians) as well as ''nain'' and ''sanggung''.&lt;ref name="EncyKorea"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://100.empas.com/dicsearch/pentry.html?s=K&amp;i=255134&amp;v=42 |script-title=ko:궁녀 (宮女) |publisher=[[Empas]] / [[EncyKorea]] |language=Korean, English}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Britannica"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://100.empas.com/dicsearch/pentry.html?s=B&amp;i=116737&amp;v=42 |script-title=ko:궁녀 (宮女) |publisher=[[Empas]] / [[Britannica]] |language=Korean, English}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term spans those from [[courtier]]s to [[domestic worker]]s.

== Establishment ==
[[File:Korea-Dae Jang Geum Theme Park-41.jpg|thumb|In the [[Dae Jang Geum]] theme park, a model of the royal kitchen in which ''gungnyeo'' worked is displayed.]]
Although the first record of ''gungnyeo'' appears in ''[[Goryeosa]]'', a compilation on the history of [[Goryeo]], a provision was first made in 1392 by [[Taejo of Joseon|King Taejo]] per [[Jo Jun]] (趙浚) and other officers' suggestions after the establishment of the [[Joseon Dynasty]]. In 1428 [[Sejong the Great]] set up a detailed system regulating ''gungnyeo'', in which female officers were divided into ''naegwan'' (internal offices, concerned with the royal court)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aks.ac.kr/glossary/glossary_detail.asp?g_code=1370&amp;page=1&amp;c_code=&amp;search_field=all&amp;keyword=naegwan&amp;order=g_korean&amp;kanada= |title=내관(內官), naegwan  |publisher=[[The Academy of Korean Studies]] |language=Korean, English}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''gunggwan'' (palace officers), and defined their ranks, titles, and social status. He further institutionalized the system, with revisions, in the [[Gyeongguk daejeon]] (Complete Code of Laws).&lt;ref name="Britannica" /&gt;

The ''gungnyeo'' were not clearly defined during the Goryeo period, and it is not known how they came to serve the court and what procedures applied to them. The use of the term during that period is therefore assumed to refer to all women in the king's service in the court. In documents related to Goryeo, the social status of ''gungnyeo'' was generally commoner or lower class, such as the daughters of slaves, concubines, or [[cheonmin]] (the despised). In the 22nd year of [[Uijong of Goryeo|King Uijong]] ''gungnyeo'' roles were divided into ''sanggung'' (尙宮, managing the palace), ''sangchim'' (尙寢, managing [[bedding]]), ''sangsik'' (尙食 managing food), and another type of ''sangchim'' (尙針, managing sewing). Female musicians called ''yeoak'' were also a part of the ''gungnyeo''.&lt;ref name="Britannica" /&gt;

During the Joseon Dynasty, court life was centered on the King, so many court women were necessary. They were assigned to the ''Daejeon'' (大殿; the Great Hall&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aks.ac.kr/glossary/glossary_detail.asp?g_code=8097&amp;page=1&amp;c_code=&amp;search_field=all&amp;keyword=Daejeon&amp;order=g_korean&amp;kanada= |title=대전(大殿), daejeon |publisher=The Academy of Korean Studies |language=Korean, English}}&lt;/ref&gt;), ''Naejeon'' (內殿, private inner royal hall&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aks.ac.kr/glossary/glossary_detail.asp?g_code=14287&amp;page=1&amp;c_code=&amp;search_field=all&amp;keyword=Naejeon&amp;order=g_korean&amp;kanada= |title=내전(內殿), naejeon|publisher=The Academy of Korean Studies |language=Korean, English}}&lt;/ref&gt;), the ''Daebijeon'' (the [[Queen dowager]]'s quarter), or the ''Sejajeon'' (the crown prince's quarter) of the palace.&lt;ref name="Britannica" /&gt;

== Election and education ==
[[File:Gyechuk ilgi-Dairy of 1613.jpg|thumb|110px|''Gyechuk ilgi'', Diary of 1613]]
The appointment of ''gungnyeo'' usually occurred one year in ten, but there were exceptions; the method of appointing ''gungnyeo'' and their social status differed from time to time, so the process was not systematized. In general, gungnyeo were chosen from among female slaves who belonged to the governing class rather than from daughters of the ''[[sangmin]]'' (common people in rank). However, if circumstances allowed, people around the king wanted to pick ''gungnyeo'' from commoners' children, using a custom of early marriage in households that had a daughter over ten years old. As a result, since [[Gyeongjong of Joseon|King Gyeongjong]]'s reign, daughters from the lower class were prohibited to be appointed as ''gungnyeo''. According to the ''[[Sokdaejeon]]'' (Supplement to the National Code), some female slaves of each government office were chosen to become ''gungnyeo'' since the reign of [[Yeongjo of Joseon|King Yeongjo]].

While this restriction on class applied to "common gungnyeo", the appointment of those in important roles, closely waiting on the king and queen, such as ''jimil nain'', was different. The standard for choosing ''jimil nain'' was so high that ''[[sanggung]]'' tended to go out recruiting candidates through personal connections and by family custom. There were many  ''gungnyeo'' in service who recommended their relatives for the position. The social status of the ''gungnyeo'' who were assigned to ''jimil'', ''chimbang'' (the sewing department), and ''subang'' (the [[embroidery]] department) came from the ''[[jungin]]'' class (literally "middle class"); the others mostly came from "commoner's class". Common ''gungnyeo'' entered the palace at the age of twelve to thirteen, whereas ''jimil nain'' entered there at the age of four to eight, and ''nain'' for the sewing and embroidery departments began to serve the court at six to thirteen.

Such "trainee ''gungnyeo''" received the necessary education to become ''gungnyeo'', such as learning court language, required daily conducts and behaviors, and writing ''[[gungche]]'' (palace-style font). Some ''gungnyeo'' left refined [[calligraphy]] works written in [[hangul]] (the Korean alphabet) with the ''gungche'' or ''[[Gyechuk ilgi]]'' (Diary of the Year [[Gyechuk]], 1613&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aks.ac.kr/glossary/glossary_detail.asp?g_code=445&amp;page=264&amp;c_code=&amp;search_field=&amp;keyword=&amp;order=g_munkwang&amp;kanada= |title=Glossary of Korean Studies |publisher=The Academy of Korean Studies |accessdate=2010-01-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;) and ''Inhyeon wanghujeon'' (Tales of [[Queen Inhyeon]]), all of which are regarded as excellent examples of the "palace literature".&lt;ref name="Britannica" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lWuUVEKeAlwC&amp;pg=PA96&amp;dq=kyech'uk+ilgi |title=An Introduction to Classical Korean Literature: From Hyangga to Pʻansori |author=Kichung Kim |publisher=M.E. Sharpe|year=1996 |page=96 |isbn=1-56324-786-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The types of gungnyeo ==

=== In the narrow meaning ===
''Gungnyeo'' always distinguished themselves from the ''[[sanggung]]'' and ''nain'' because the role and social status of the groups were greatly different. The latter groups can be divided into three types; trainee ''nain'', ''nain'', and ''sanggung''. They were treated differently according experience and length of service at court and in affiliated departments. Even the ''sanggung'' group was divided by rank according to their experience, and sanggung with the same rank did not always have the same social standing. Trainee nain referred to girls who had not yet passed the [[gwallye]] (冠禮, a coming-of-age ceremony), and they were divided into ''saenggaksi'' and ''gaksi''. The term, ''saenggaksi'' derives from the fact that the girls had a hairstyle called ''saengmeori''. Only three departments, ''jimil'', ''chimbang'', and ''subang'' had the ''saenggaksi''. After 15 years service in the palace the trainee ''nain'' became an official ''nain''. ''Nain'' wore a [[jade]]-colored ''[[dangui]]'' (a variety of ''[[jeogori]]'', a short jacket) and a navy blue ''[[chima (clothing)|chima]]'' (a bulky skirt) and decorated their head with a frog-shaped ''[[cheopji]]'' (a hairpin).&lt;ref name="EncyKorea" /&gt;

=== In the broad meaning ===
''Gaksimi'' is a generic term collectively referring to a housemaid, kitchen-maid, [[seamstress]] or others working at a sanggung's private residence on the sanggung's days off. Their monthly salary was paid by the state, so they were also called "bangja". The term ''bangja'' means a clerk working at a government office and is the same as the male character called ''bangja'' who appears in ''[[Chunhyangjeon]]'' (Story of Chunhyang).&lt;ref name="EncyKorea" /&gt; ''[[Musuri]]'' refers to women in charge of miscellaneous jobs (such as drawing water, making a fire, etc.) at every residence at court.&lt;ref name="EncyKorea" /&gt;

''Sonnim'' is a type of housemaid who took charge of housekeeping at the king's concubine's residence. They were generally related to the concubine's family, and their salary was paid from the concubine's living expenses. The term means a person from outside of the palace and is a courtesy title, unlike ''musuri'' and ''gaksimi''.&lt;ref name="EncyKorea" /&gt;

''[[Uinyeo]]'' literally means "medicine women" and they usually treated ''gungnyeo'' with [[acupuncture]] and acted as [[midwifery|midwife]] when the king's consort or concubine gave birth. Whenever a feast was held at court they transformed themselves into ''[[gisaeng]]'' (female entertainers). For such occasions, they wore ''[[wonsam]]'' (a female ceremonial garment), ''[[hwagwan]]'' (an elaborate [[coronet]]) on their head and [[saekdongot|colorfully striped]] ''[[hansam]]'' (fabric extensions on the sleeves of the costume)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BcGzVoCvWZMC&amp;pg=PA425&amp;dq=hansam+korea |title=Bold Words: A Century of Asian American Writing |page=425 |isbn=0-8135-2966-2 |publisher=Rutgers University Press |author=Rajini Srikanth |author2=Esther Yae Iwanaga |year=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Rj2W7MrqgRUC&amp;pg=RA1-PA213&amp;dq=hansam+korea |title=A history of Asian American theatre |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=2006 |author=Lee, Esther Kim |isbn=0-521-85051-7 |page=193 |accessdate=2010-01-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=v9cQ8kyTpsoC&amp;pg=PA81&amp;dq=hansam+korea |author=Zile, Judy Van |title=Perspectives on Korean dance|publisher=Wesleyan University Press |year=2001 |isbn=0-8195-6494-X |accessdate=2010-01-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; on their hands just like dancers, so they were also called ''yakbang gisaeng''. Consequently, ''yakbang'' is another name for ''[[naeuiwon]]'' (royal health clinic). Although ''uinyeo'''s affiliation was to the ''naeuiwon'', their predecessors were gisaeng. The ''uinyeo'' system was originally established during [[Taejong of Joseon|King Taejong]]'s reign because sick consorts, concubines and gungnyeo preferred to die rather than to be seen by a male doctor, due to the strict ''[[naeoebeop]]'' ([[sex segregation]]), based on [[Confucianism]], at that time.

Slave girls who belonged to storage or government offices were therefore chosen to train in medical practices such as pulse-checking, acupuncture and others. Because they were originally uneducated ''cheonmin'' (the despised), the uinyeo system was not very fruitful. During [[Yeonsangun of Joseon|King Yeonsangun]]'s reign, whenever a feast was held at each government office, ''uinyeo'' were told to participate in it as ''gisaeng'' with makeup. The system lasted until the end of the dynasty and the number of ''uinyeo'' was about 80 during [[Gojong of the Korean Empire|King Gojong]]'s reign. The ''uinyeo'' system disappeared when Western doctors entered the court.&lt;ref name="EncyKorea" /&gt;

== Gungnyeo's roles ==
[[File:Korea-Seoul-Royal wedding ceremony 1334-06.JPG|thumb|In a reenactment of a royal wedding ceremony, two models acting as ''gungnyeo'' assist the model of the queen in the red robe.]]
''Gungnyeo'' can be described as a type of luxurious slaves for royal private life, needed in departments in charge of clothing, cooking and housing among others. Such places were ''jimil'' ("the innermost quarter", waiting closely on royalty), ''chimbang'' (the [[sewing]] department), ''subang'' (the embroidery department), two ''sojubang''; ''naesojobang'' and ''oesojubang'', one for preparing daily meals, another for preparing food for banquets, ''saenggwabang'' (the dessert department), and ''sedapbang'' (the laundry department).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aks.ac.kr/glossary/glossary_detail.asp?g_code=9669&amp;page=1&amp;c_code=&amp;search_field=all&amp;keyword=sojubang&amp;order=g_korean&amp;kanada= |title=Glossary of Korean Studies |publisher=The Academy of Korean Studies |accessdate=2010-01-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to those seven departments, four other departments existed: ''sesugan'' (洗手間, the department in charge of the king and queen's washing and bathing&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kordic.empas.com/dicsearch/view.html?i=21586400 |title='세수간' – 네이트 국어사전 |publisher=Kordic.empas.com |accessdate=2010-01-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;), ''toeseongan'' (退膳間; a food arrangement room&lt;ref name="KTO" /&gt;), ''bogicheo'' (僕伊處, the department for making fires&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kordic.empas.com/dicsearch/view.html?i=17216300 |title='복이처' – 네이트 국어사전 |publisher=Kordic.empas.com |accessdate=2010-01-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;), ''deungchokbang'' (燈燭房 the department for [[lantern]]s and [[candle]]light&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kordic.empas.com/dicsearch/view.html?i=11001700 |title='등촉방' – 네이트 국어사전 |publisher=Kordic.empas.com |accessdate=2010-01-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;).

In terms of a more common individual's household ''jimil nain'', who had the highest standing in ''gungnyeo'' society, acted like a personal maid to the mistress. ''Nain'' (assistant court ladies) at ''chimbang'', and ''subang'' were like [[seamstress]]es while ''nain'' at ''sojubang'' and ''saenggwabang'' were like kitchen-maids. ''Sedapbang'' managed the laundry; in common families, female slaves generally did the cleaning, while experienced housewives ironed and smoothed laundry by pounding. ''Jimil nain'' had the highest social status while nain at ''chimbang'', and ''subang'' were next in status. They could wear a ''chima'' (a bulky skirt) in the way which ''[[yangban]]'' women did, and were allowed as a privilege to let it down long without wearing an apron. Since they worked on a floor or in a room, these nain did not need to fold up their skirt, unlike nain at ''sojubang'', and ''sedapbang''. Nain at the other departments rolled up their skirt with an apron. Likewise, only the former three departments could have ''saenggaksi'' (생각시, young ''nain'' with a hairstyle called "saeng" or "sayang"), while young nain at the others could not bind their hair with ''saeng'' but had to let it down in long braids.&lt;ref name="EncyKorea" /&gt;

== Gungnyeo's rank ==
Gungnyeo society had supervisors who acted as the head of the ''gungnyeo'' group, and ''[[sanggung]]'' who received special treatment according to the importance of their job. ''Jejo sanggung'' (提調尙宮), also called ''Keunbang sanggung'' were senior among gungnyeo and received the king's orders and managed properties in the queen's quarter. They exercised political power at the time. ''Bujejo sanggung'' also called ''Arigo sanggung'' (阿里庫) took charge of items in stores attached to the queen's quarter. ''Jimil sanggung'' also called '' Daeryeong sanggung'' waited closely on the king. ''Bomo sanggung'' took charge of nursing princes or princesses, and among them those who served the crown prince had the highest standing among the group. ''Sinyeo sanggung'' were in charge of assisting the king, queen and queen dowager whenever a national ceremony or feast occurred. They also managed books and documents of the ''Jimil sanggung'' and did ''gokeup'' (mourning and crying loudly). ''Gamchal sanggung'' gave rewards or punishments to relevant gungnyeo, acting as a supervisors, and were held in awe by other gungnyeo. Some ''gungnyeo'' who were favoured by the king could take political power and improve their rank.&lt;ref name="EncyKorea" /&gt;

Palace ladies were subordinated to the queen, and were ranked below the [[Royal Noble Consort]]s (''ne-gwan'' 내관).  The ranks for gungnyeo would could reach the 5th rank at the highest, but typically started much lower in the 9th rank.

There were 5 ranks for palace ladies with two level each.

* Fifth rank upper - '''Royal concubine''' (sang-gung 상궁) was a special palace lady who already had sexual relationship with the king. The appointment decree was issued by the queen.
* Fifth rank lower - '''First Palace Lady''' (leading the Royal/Queen's Secretariat): Sang-bok (상복) and Sang-shik (상식)
* Sixth rank upper - '''Chief Palace Lady''' (e.g. leading the royal kitchen): Sang-chim (상침) and Sang-gong (상공) 
* Sixth rank lower - Sang-jeong (상정) and Sang-gi (상기)
* Seventh rank upper - '''Leading Palace Lady''' (being charge of a specific activity): Chon-bin (전빈), Chon-ui (전의) and Chon-son (전선) 
* Seventh rank lower - Jeon-seol (전설), Jeon-je (전제) and Jeon-eon (전언)
* Eighth rank upper - Jeon-chan (전찬), Jeon-shik (전식) and Jeon-yak (전약) 
* Eighth rank lower - Jeon-deung (전등), Jeon-che (전채) and Jeon-jeong (전정)
* Ninth rank upper - Ju-gung (주궁), Ju-sang (주상) and Ju-gak (주각) 
* Ninth rank lower - Ju-byeon-chi (주변치), ju-chi (주치), ju-oo (주우) and Ju-byeon-gung (주변궁)

The palace ladies were followed by lower rank ladies-in-waiting (e.g. palace lady candidates), servants and slaves.

== The number of gungnyeo ==
The total number of ''gungnyeo'' included not only ''gungnyeo'' at the main palace where the king resided but also at ''Jesagung'', palaces for ''[[jesa]]'', ([[ancestor veneration]]) and ''Byeolgung'', (annexed palaces). ''Gungnyeo'' who worked within the main palace despised those who worked in annexed palaces, calling them ''gunggeot'' (the one at the palace). In the main palace, the king's quarter was managed as an independent household, and all of the king, queen, queen dowager's quarters had the same number of ''gungnyeo''. It has been suggested that ''gungnyeo'' numbered 90 in total. Each of these residences would have twenty to twenty seven ''jimil nain'' and the other places would have fifteen to twenty.&lt;ref name="EncyKorea" /&gt;

The total number differed from time and was increased or decreased depending on circumstances at court. While the number of ''gungnyeo'' in the early period of the Joseon Dynasty was not great, it tended to increase as time went by. During [[Seongjong of Joseon|King Seongjong]]'s reign (1469–1494), 105 ''gungnyeo'' in total served the palace, with 29 for the mother of the previous king, 27 for the queen dowager's quarter and 49 for the king's quarter. During the reign of [[Gojong of the Korean Empire|King Gojong]] (1863–1907), the total number of ''gungnyeo'' reached 480; 100 for the king's quarter, 100 for the queen dowager's quarter, 100 for the queen, 60 for the crown prince, 40 for the consort of the heir apparent, 50 for the ''seson'', the son of the prince successor, and 30 for the wife of the ''seson''.&lt;ref name="Britannica" /&gt;

== Lifetime employment and payment ==
All ''gungnyeo'' within the palace were basically tied for life, from their acceptance into the palace until the time at which they had to leave. Once they entered service they had to live inside the palace for their whole life, except for special occasions. Apart from the king and his immediate household, nobody, not even his concubines, could die in the royal court, so when ''gungnyeo'' became old or ill, they had to leave the palace. There were other reasons to release ''gungnyeo'' from the palace, such as when their superior or master was ill, or when a drought happened, a certain number of ''gungnyeo'' were released in appeasement of the natural calamity. In the latter case, such released ''gungnyeo'' were restricted in their actions, prohibited from marrying, and would be harshly punished if they violated these rules. Thus ''gungnyeo'' lived completely isolated from outside life, and were not allowed to contact men, or even other women, except by release from service. The life of ''gungnyeo'' is depicted in an ancient novel titled ''[[Unyeongjeon]]'' (雲英傳) written by an anonymous writer during the Joseon Dynasty.&lt;ref name="Britannica" /&gt;

''Gungnyeo'' received a graded monthly salary according to rank and living necessities as their payment, but the price was not fixed. It varied according to economic circumstances at that time. Service was assumed to be on a day-shift basis.&lt;ref name="Britannica" /&gt;

'''Hay House''' is a publisher founded in 1984 by author [[Louise Hay]], who is known for her books on [[New Thought]]. Hay House has its headquarters in [[Carlsbad, California|Carlsbad]], [[California]] and is (as of 2018) run by Reid Tracy. Hay House describes itself as a "[[new age|mind-body-spirit]] and transformational enterprise". Their target audience are readers interested in [[self-help]], [[personal development|personal growth]], and [[alternative medicine]].

==History==
Hay House was founded in 1984, and incorporated in 1987,{{R|"Hay House"}} to market Louise Hay's self help books, including, ''Heal Your Body'' and ''[[You Can Heal Your Life]]''. Soon after Hay House began publishing for other authors that fall into the category of mind-body-spirit such as [[Wayne Dyer]], [[Suze Orman]], [[Deepak Chopra]], [[Marianne Williamson]], [[Sylvia Browne]], [[Travis Smiley]] and Doreen Virtue.{{R|"Oppenheimer"}}

Reid Tracy joined Hay House as an accountant in 1988.{{R|"Oppenheimer"}} He went on to take over as the CEO in 1990 at the age of 25.{{R| "Warth"}}

They are headquartered in [[Carlsbad, California|Carlsbad]], [[California]]{{R|"Oppenheimer"}} with auxiliary offices in [[New York City|New York]], [[London]], [[Sydney]], [[Johannesburg]], and [[New Delhi]].{{R|"Wenner"}}

As of 2018, Hay House reports that they publish books by more than 130 authors and sells their products and services in over 35 countries and that they employ over 100 full time staff members.{{R|"Hay House"}}

==Mission and Practice==

Hay House publishes authors who write on such topics as [[psychic reading]], [[energy medicine|energy healing]], [[meditation]], [[tarot|tarot cards]], [[alternative medicine]], [[numerology]], [[astrology]], and holistic health. Hay House hosts group events where fans can pay for admission to seminars by the authors who can then make presentations. They also publish CDs, DVDs, calendars and card decks.{{R|"Oppenheimer"}}{{R|"Hay House"}}

The publisher also offers a radio station, Hay House Radio, which provides live radio shows by Hay House authors.{{R|"Oppenheimer"}} They also have spin off websites such as Hay House Online Learning, a place to take online classes by their authors, and Heal Your Life, an online self-help and personal growth program. These services are available as applications for phones and tablets. They also have a division called Balboa Press, a self publishing company, which was created in partnership with [[Author Solutions]] in 2010.{{R|"Hay House"}}{{R|"Balboa"}} 

Hay House promotes the idea that “traditional Western learning, as codified by universities that bestow fancy degrees, is woefully incomplete, sometimes harmful, and must be supplemented by other ways of knowing”. Hay House founder, Louise Hay, explains that Hay House does not actually endorse everything their authors write. They also do turn away some authors and work hard to stay on trend with the latest fashions in self-help.{{R|"Oppenheimer"}}

In a 2008 article Oppenheimer quotes current CEO, Reid Tracy, as saying, “As of right now we’ve sold over 40 million products in the U.S., and we think a lot of those people have been helped.” Hay House does not test the claims made by their authors. The authors gain merit with the publisher based on the testimonials they receive as opposed to the credibility or accuracy of their claims.{{R|"Oppenheimer"}}

'''Heroic medicine''', also referred to as '''heroic depletion theory''', was a therapeutic method advocating for rigorous treatment of [[bloodletting]], [[Vomiting#Emetics|purging]], and sweating to shock the body back to health after an illness caused by a [[Humorism|humoral]] imbalance.  Rising to the front of orthodox medical practice in the "Age of Heroic Medicine" (1780–1850),&lt;ref name="Trick"&gt;{{cite book|url={{Google books|bZjlC2LELlIC|page=108|plainurl=yes}}|title=Trick Or Treatment: The Undeniable Facts about Alternative Medicine|last=Singh|first=Simon|last2=Ernst|first2=Edzard|publisher=W. W. Norton &amp; Company|year=2008|page=108|authorlink1=Simon Singh|authorlink2=Edzard Ernst|isbn=978-0-393-06661-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; it fell out of favor in the mid-19th century as more gentle, palliative treatments became the norm.&lt;ref&gt;Flint, August (1874) ''Essays on Conservative Medicine''&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Pockets of medical methodology that can be classified as "heroic" appear in the early 17th century with Parisian physician [[Guy Patin]] and French anatomist [[Jean Riolan the Younger]].  Patin, nicknamed "Le Grand Saigneur" (the Grand Bloodletter), was infamous for his rigorous procedure plans, which included intensive courses of bloodletting and application of [[Senna (plant)|senna]]. Because heroic medicine used popular techniques, it is difficult to absolutely classify a healer's therapeutic epistemology as heroic. Intensive bloodletting treatments can be identified throughout American history, with [[William Douglass (physician)|William Douglass]] in Massachusetts advocating for a heroic treatment plan in the early 18th century.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  While there were practitioners here and there who were particularly eager to perform aggressive treatment, heroic medicine did not become a concentrated school of thought until later in the 18th century.

Many associate [[Benjamin Rush]] with an abrupt acceptance of heroic techniques into the realm of mainstream medicine, especially in America.  Founding father, creator of [[Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania|University of Pennsylvania’s medical school]], and known as the "American Hippocrates," Rush was well respected and revered in the medical field.  The [[1793 Philadelphia yellow fever epidemic|Philadelphia Yellow Fever outbreak]] in 1793 is looked upon as a major event in the merging of heroic medicine into the course of best practices in the medical profession.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Much of the city was left incapacitated by the rampant epidemic.  As healers fled the city, Rush bravely remained to treat people, and ultimately himself, with drastic regimens of intensive bloodlettings and purgatives.{{Citation needed|date=April 2017}} He taught many students who then carried the tradition to other parts of the United States. Varied in its influence, heroic medicine was particularly concentrated around Pennsylvania and spread into other locations. The term "heroic medicine" was coined later in the mid-19th century to describe extreme treatment.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Heroic medicine was used to treat [[George Washington]] on his deathbed in 1799. He was bled repeatedly and given [[Mercury(I) chloride]] (calomel) and several blisters of [[cantharidin]] to induce sweating. Washington died shortly after receiving this rigorous heroic treatment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=9392943 |year=1997 |author1=Stavrakis |first1=P |title=Heroic medicine, bloodletting, and the sad fate of George Washington |journal=Maryland Medical Journal |volume=46 |issue=10 |pages=539–40 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1177/096777200501300410 |pmid=16244717 |title=The Death of George Washington (1732–99) and the History of Cynanche |journal=Journal of Medical Biography |volume=13 |issue=4 |pages=225–31 |year=2005 |last1=Cohen |first1=Ben }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=11896346 |year=2002 |author1=Schmidt |first1=P.

Heroic medicine was very much in the hands of the professional, as the invasive interventions involved were beyond the capabilities of rustic practitioners. Symptoms were not regarded as the body's attempt to fight the disease, but were considered a complication that would exacerbate the patient's condition and do further harm. Practitioners believed that a fever should be suppressed and any drugs used should be powerful and given in large dosages. Under this onslaught, domestic medicine dwindled in importance; even treatments that had been found effective in the past were relegated to the realms of old-fashioned folk medicine.&lt;ref name="Lyng1990"&gt;{{cite book|author=Lyng, Stephen|title=Holistic Health and Biomedical Medicine: A Countersystem Analysis |url={{Google books|J24_NDF_zhQC|page=175|plainurl=yes}} |year=1990 |publisher=SUNY Press |isbn=978-0-7914-0256-6 |pages=175–9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Practices ==
Heroic medicine does not have a definitive start date, as its treatments themselves were not new to the field of medicine.  [[Bloodletting]], [[Vomiting#Emetics|purging]], and [[Perspiration|sweating]] are cemented firmly in medical tradition back to the advent of humoral theory in the time of [[Hippocrates]] and [[Galen]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Scientific Practice of Medicine in the Nineteenth Century|last=Bynum|first=W. E.|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1996|isbn=0-521-25109-5|location=Cambridge|pages=18}}&lt;/ref&gt;  With hopes of rebalancing the body's delicate homeostasis of four humors – black bile, yellow bile, phlegm, and blood – the careful manipulation of bodily discharge, like bleeding and evacuation, was believed to nudge the body back to its healthy, natural state.  The physician's role was always to monitor the path of the body's humoral levels back to normal.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Medicine and Society in Early Modern Europe|last=Lindemann|first=Mary|publisher=Cambridge|year=2010|isbn=978-0-521-73256-7|location=Cambridge|pages=117}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Heroic medicine takes this methodology to the extreme, draining significant volumes of blood and ordering intensive regimens of evacuation.  It was not uncommon for physicians to strive to drain up to 80 percent of a patient's blood volume.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Likewise, dramatic evacuations, both by pharmacological [[Vomiting|emetics]] and [[laxative]]s, induced the forceful removal of bodily fluid. Commonly used emetics include [[Senna (plant)|senna]] and [[Antimony potassium tartrate|tartar emetic]].  General intestinal cleansing was instigated by massive doses of [[Mercury(I) chloride|calomel]], to the point of acute mercury poisoning.  Sweating was also induced using blisters of [[cantharidin]] and [[diaphoretic]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=8049598 |year=1994 |author1=Sullivan |first1=R. B. |title=Sanguine practices: A historical and historiographic reconsideration of heroic therapy in the age of Rush |journal=Bulletin of the History of Medicine |volume=68 |issue=2 |pages=211–34 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Fall of heroic medicine ==
Heroic medicine became less favoured with the rise of safer [[placebos]] such as [[hydrotherapy]] and [[homeopathy]]. Even during its heyday, heroic medicine faced criticism from physicians and alternative medicine healers, who pushed for more natural cures.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Nature Cures: The History of Alternative Medicine in America|last=Whorton|first=James|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2002|isbn=|location=|pages=}}{{pn|date=June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While it is easy to discuss and question the ethical implications of such a severe course of treatment, it is important to remember that in that time period physicians were operating under their best understanding of the body and its physiology. There were dissenting voices at the time, but heroic medicine remained an important, legitimate part of the medical tradition in that era.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The '''Lake Hopatcong Yacht Club''' is a private club located in [[Mount Arlington, New Jersey|Mount Arlington]], [[Morris County, New Jersey|Morris County]], [[New Jersey]], United States, in the northwestern part of New Jersey, on the state's largest lake, [[Lake Hopatcong]]. 

The club is non-profit, and governed by a slate of volunteers, elected by its members. The organization features an active sailing and social schedule, with an emphasis on activities for the entire family. 

==History==
The club was founded in 1905, and the current clubhouse dates to 1910.&lt;ref name="Lake Hopatcong Yacht Club Web Page"&gt;[http://www.lhyc.com/ Lake Hopatcong Yacht Club Web Page]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004, as part of the Club's centennial celebrations, N.J.

The exterior is white; the "great hall" interior displays the Adirondack architecture with dark woodwork, decorated in a nautical motif with the photographs of all past commodores adorning the walls. There is a large porch used for dining and gatherings that overlooks the lake.

The Clubhouse structure is on the National and New Jersey registers of historic places.&lt;ref&gt;[http://usasearch.gov/search?affiliate=nps&amp;v%3Aproject=firstgov&amp;input-form=advanced-firstgov&amp;query=lake+hopatcong+yacht+club&amp;query-quote=NR&amp;buttonName=go / National Park Service Web Page]&lt;/ref&gt; The LHYC Historical Foundation exists to support the maintenance and restoration of the  historical building.&lt;ref name="Lake Hopatcong Yacht Club Web Page"/&gt;

'''Languedocien''' (French name) or '''Lengadocian''' (native name) is an [[Occitan language|Occitan]] dialect spoken in rural parts of southern [[France]] such as [[Languedoc]], [[Rouergue]], [[Quercy]], [[Agenais]] and Southern [[Périgord]]. Due to its central position among the dialects of Occitan, it is often used as a basis for a Standard Occitan.&lt;ref&gt;Claudi Balaguer, "Languedocian: A Central and Interface Dialect within Occitan", in John Partridge (ed.), [https://books.google.fr/books?id=xF4nBwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA137&amp;dq=Philippe+Blanchet+Occitanie&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjz46Lik67JAhUC0xQKHd9sC-UQ6AEIbzAI#v=onepage&amp;q=Languedocian&amp;f=false ''Interfaces in Language''], Cambridge Scholars Publishing, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

About 10% of the population of Languedoc are fluent in the language (about 300,000),and another 20% (600,000) "have some understanding" of the language. All speak French as their first or second language.

The '''[[Causses|Causse]] du Larzac''' is a [[limestone]] [[karst]] [[plateau]] in the south of the [[Massif Central]], [[France]], situated between [[Millau]] ([[Aveyron]]) and [[Lodève]] ([[Hérault]]). It is an agricultural area, where [[Lacaune (sheep)|sheep]] produce milk for [[Roquefort cheese]].

==Geography==

==History==
{{Main| Fight for the Larzac}}
In October 1970, [[Michel Debré]],  the French Minister of Defense, decided for strategic purposes to expand a military camp outside the village of La Cavalerie in the French ''[[Departments of France|département]]'' of [[Aveyron]], from 30&amp;nbsp;km² to 170&amp;nbsp;km², without consulting the local population. Local farmers objected and decided to fight against the project, through actions such as occupation of empty farms purchased by the Army in anticipation of this expansion. French syndicalist and peasant activist [[José Bové]] moved there during this period in support of the protests. Communards from the nearby Community of the Ark, led by the pacifist [[Lanza del Vasto]], were also very active in opposition to the camp. The workers of the occupied and self-managed [[Lip factory]] also took part in the movement.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.flickr.com/photos/jean-paul-margnac/sets/72157594436265379/ Lip Larzac 1973 - photos]&lt;/ref&gt;

Following ten years of [[nonviolent resistance]], the plan was cancelled by President [[François Mitterrand]] after his election in 1981.

Because of its history it was chosen as the site of a massive meeting against the [[World Trade Organization]] which took place in August 2003.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.monde-solidaire.org/larzac-2003/uk/ “The World Is Not For Sale” Gathering on the Larzac against the world trade organization (8-10 August 2003)]&lt;/ref&gt; [[José Bové]] currently resides in Larzac - he secured nearly 500,000 votes in the 2007 presidential elections.

==Sights==
Five medieval fortified villages, related to the [[Knights Templar]] and the [[Knights Hospitaller]] are located on the Larzac plateau: 
* [[La Cavalerie]]
* [[La Couvertoirade]]
* Saint-Jean-d'Alcas,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aveyron.com/english/tourism/templar-alcas.html Saint-Jean-d'Alcas]&lt;/ref&gt; part of the [[Saint-Jean-et-Saint-Paul]] [[commune in France|commune]]

{{Legality_of_cannabis_by_US_state}}

In the United States, the use and possession of [[Cannabis (drug)|cannabis]] is illegal under federal law for any purpose, by way of the [[Controlled Substances Act]] of 1970. Under the CSA, cannabis is classified as a Schedule I substance, determined to have a high potential for abuse and no accepted medical use – thereby prohibiting even medical use of the drug.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=State-By-State Medical Marijuana Laws|url=https://www.mpp.org/issues/medical-marijuana/state-by-state-medical-marijuana-laws/state-by-state-medical-marijuana-laws-report/|publisher=Marijuana Policy Project|date=December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the state level, however, policies regarding the [[Medical cannabis|medical]] and [[Recreational drug use|recreational]] use of cannabis vary greatly, and in many states conflict significantly with federal law.

The [[Medical cannabis in the United States|medical use of cannabis]] is legal (with a doctor's recommendation) in 33 states, the [[Washington, D.C.|District of Columbia]], and the territories of [[Guam]] and [[Puerto Rico]].&lt;ref name="NCSL MMJ"&gt;{{cite web|title=State Medical Marijuana Laws|url=http://www.ncsl.org/research/health/state-medical-marijuana-laws.aspx|website=National Conference of State Legislatures|date=June 27, 2018|accessdate=July 3, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Fourteen other states have laws that limit [[Tetrahydrocannabinol|THC]] content, for the purpose of allowing access to products that are rich in [[cannabidiol]] (CBD), a non-[[Psychoactive drug|psychoactive]] component of cannabis.&lt;ref name="NCSL MMJ" /&gt;  Although cannabis remains a Schedule I drug, the [[Rohrabacher–Farr amendment]] prohibits federal prosecution of individuals complying with state medical cannabis laws.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Ingraham|first1=Christopher|title=Jeff Sessions personally asked Congress to let him prosecute medical-marijuana providers|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2017/06/13/jeff-sessions-personally-asked-congress-to-let-him-prosecute-medical-marijuana-providers/|accessdate=December 31, 2017|work=The Washington Post|date=June 13, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Decriminalization of non-medical cannabis in the United States|recreational use of cannabis]] is legal in 10 states ([[Alaska]], [[California]], [[Colorado]], [[Maine]], [[Massachusetts]], [[Michigan]], [[Nevada]], [[Oregon]], [[Vermont]], and [[Washington (state)|Washington]]), the [[District of Columbia]], and the [[Northern Mariana Islands]].  Another 13 states plus the [[U.S. Virgin Islands]] have decriminalized.&lt;ref name="NCSL decrim"&gt;{{cite web|title=MARIJUANA OVERVIEW|url=http://www.ncsl.org/research/civil-and-criminal-justice/marijuana-overview.aspx|website=National Conference of State Legislatures|accessdate=December 31, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Commercial distribution of cannabis is allowed in all jurisdictions where cannabis has been legalized, except Vermont and the District of Columbia.  Prior to January 2018, the [[Cole Memorandum]] provided some protection against the enforcement of federal law in states that have legalized, but it was rescinded by Attorney General [[Jeff Sessions]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Zapotosky|first1=Matt|last2=Horwitz|first2=Sari|last3=Achenbach|first3=Joel|title=Use of legalized marijuana threatened as Sessions rescinds Obama-era directive that eased federal enforcement|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/sessions-is-rescinding-obama-era-directive-for-feds-to-back-off-marijuana-enforcement-in-states-with-legal-pot/2018/01/04/b1a42746-f157-11e7-b3bf-ab90a706e175_story.html|accessdate=January 4, 2018|work=The Washington Post|date=January 4, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the use of cannabis remains federally illegal, some of its derivative compounds have been approved by the [[Food and Drug Administration]] for prescription use.  [[Cannabinoid]] drugs which have received FDA approval are [[Marinol]], [[Syndros]], [[Cesamet]], and [[Epidiolex]].  [[Cannabidiol]] is also sold by numerous online retailers who claim their products are derived from [[industrial hemp]] and therefore legal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Summers|first1=DJ|title=Is CBD Oil Legal?

"'''Lost boys'''" is a term used for young men who have been excommunicated or pressured to leave [[Polygamy|polygamous]] [[Mormon fundamentalism|Mormon fundamentalist]] groups such as the [[Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints]] (FLDS).&lt;ref name="Borger-2005"&gt;{{cite news | first = Julian | last = Borger | url = https://www.theguardian.com/usa/story/0,12271,1505997,00.html | title = The lost boys, thrown out of US sect so that older men can marry more wives | publisher = [[The Guardian]] | date = 2005-06-14 | accessdate = 2007-02-14 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;  They are alleged to be pressured to leave by adult men to reduce competition for wives within such sects, usually when they are between the ages of 13 and 21.&lt;ref name="Krakauer"&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.deseretnews.com/article/595081003/Krakauer-still-vexed-by-FLDS.html |title= Krakauer still vexed by FLDS |first= Patty |last= Henetz |newspaper= [[Deseret News]] |agency= [[Associated Press|AP]] |date= July 31, 2004 |accessdate= 2013-12-11 |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100731044534/http://www.deseretnews.com/article/595081003/Krakauer-still-vexed-by-FLDS.html |archivedate= 2010-07-31 |quote= [...] Fischer has housed the castoff children and given them jobs in his company, Krakauer said.|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==
Since birth rates for boys and girls are roughly equal, and women do not enter the community in large numbers, the pool of available women is not sufficient for all men to have multiple wives.

While some boys leave by their own choice, many have been banished for conduct such as watching a movie,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first = Ned | last = Holstein, MD, MS | url = http://www.fathersandfamilies.org/2008/04/15/texas-polygamy-case-don%E2%80%99t-the-boys-count/ | title = Texas Polygamy Case: Don’t the Boys Count? | publisher = Fathers and Families | date = 2008-04-15 | accessdate = 2013-06-20 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://archive.is/20130624182153/http://www.fathersandfamilies.org/2008/04/15/texas-polygamy-case-don%E2%80%99t-the-boys-count/ | archivedate = 2013-06-24 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; watching television,&lt;ref name="Kelly-2005"&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.boston.com/news/nation/articles/2005/06/19/polygamys_lost_boys_expelled_from_only_life_they_knew/ | title = Polygamy's 'Lost Boys' expelled from only life they knew | first = David | last = Kelly | publisher = [[Los Angeles Times]] | date = 2005-06-19 | accessdate = 2008-04-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt; playing football, or talking to a girl.&lt;ref name = "Krakauer"/&gt; Some boys are told not to return unless they can return with a wife.{{cn|date=April 2018}}  A 2005 article estimated that between 400 and 1,000 boys and young men had been pressured to leave for such reasons.&lt;ref name="Borger-2005" /&gt; Many young women&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Man Accused Of Assaulting Kingston Polygamist Daughter Appears In Court | url = http://tv.ksl.com/index.php?nid=39&amp;sid=214468 | publisher = KSL-TV News | date = 2006-06-24 | accessdate = 2007-02-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt; also have left or been pressured to leave because they did not want to be part of polygamous marriages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.cnn.com/US/9808/08/polygamy/ | title = Polygamy or abuse?

==In popular culture==
In the HBO television series ''[[Big Love]]'' (2006-2011), the main protagonist is a former lost boy, having grown up challenging the elder who drove him out of their community as a teenager. The series portrays machinations of some senior men within a fundamentalist congregation to "reserve" young unmarried women for themselves.{{fact|date=October 2017}}

The documentary film ''[[Sons of Perdition (film)|Sons of Perdition]]'' ([[2010 in film|2010]]) depicts the struggles of three real-life lost boys.{{fact|date=October 2017}}

The off-Broadway play ''Exit 27'' (2013) dramatized the story of four lost boys struggling to survive in the desert outside Colorado City. Playwright Aleks Merilo based the script on interviews conducted with lost boys living in Hurricane, Utah.&lt;ref name="exit27"&gt;Clarke, David (2013-10-27).

'''Maimal''' are a [[Muslim]] community found in the state of [[Assam]] in India. They are a community of inland fishermen found in [[Western Assam]].  A few are also found in the [[Sylhet District]] of [[Bangladesh]].&lt;ref&gt;Marginal Muslim Communities in India edited by M.K.A Siddiqui pages 223–234&lt;/ref&gt; It should be worth mentioned that the "Maimal" were there in Shylhet district in the undivided India, and after the Independence some parts of that Shylhet district were merged with the state of Assam in free India. Now, this community people are spreading more or less everywhere in the Barak Valley districts in Assam.

==Origin==

According to the traditions of the community, the word Maimal is a corruption of the [[Persian language|Persian]] word mahi, which means a fisherman. The Maimal are said to have converted to [[Islam]] at the hands of the famous [[Sufi]] saint of western Assam, [[Shah Jalal|Hazrat Shah Jalal]]. They are found along the banks of the Sonai and Barak rivers. The community are found mainly in the districts of [[Cachar District|Cachar]], [[Karimganj District|Karimganj]] and [[Hailakandi District|Hailakandi]], and speak the [[Sylheti language|Sylhet]] dialect of [[Bengali language|Bengali]].&lt;ref&gt;Marginal Muslim Communities in India edited by M.K.A Siddiqui pages 223–234&lt;/ref&gt;

==Present circumstances==

The Maimal were a community of inland fishermen, but most are now settled agriculturists. They are mainly marginal farmers, growing paddy and vegetables. A small number of Maimal have taken petty trade. The Maimal live in multi-ethnic villages, occupying their own quarters, referred to as paras. They are strictly endogamous, and marry close kin. Historically, the community practised village exogamy, but this is no longer the case.

Traditionally, the maimals are localised on the banks and nearby areas of rivers and other natural water bodies owing to their customary occupation of fishing. So, roads and other means of modern communications lack in their villages.Even there are some village like Kalachori par where water remain at least for 6-month.the flood damage all paddy fields, there is no communication system, No road, no electricity, And percentage of literacy is 1%.The government is not taking any step and the leader people like Gaon panchayat is sucking all the money and the community is going backward day by day.

On the socio-economic front also, they are legging behind the other communities due to their illiteracy and backwardness in education. Due to all-round backwardness, they have been the easy prey in the clutches of the so-called high caste people.

During the early 1960s, in an attempt to emancipate this downtrodden community from the curse of socio-economic backwardness some great leaders of this community like Morhum Maulana Mumtaj uddin, Morhum Maulana Shahid Ahmed(popularly known as Raipuri sahib),Mr.Sarkum Ali (Master of Krishnapur, Hailakandi) Morhum Maulana Shamsul Islam, Morhum Foyez uddin(Master saheb of Tinghori-Bihara), Morhum Haji Sayeed Ali of Srikoan(Cachar), and few others, formed an organisation called Nikhil Cachar Muslim Fishermen Federation, with an area of operation of the then Cachar District i.e., present Barak Valley districts of State of Assam (India). This organisation led the society to give a socio – political identity and was successful to obtain the Other Backward Classes status for the maimals. Since the leadership of this organisation rolled through the elderly leaders only, a few educated youths of this community, in the mid-1980s, moved to form a youth wing which was later recognised under this organisation. The young leader, Like Nazmul Hassan, Maharam 
Ali( Of Hailakandi distt.), Fakhar Uddin Ahmed,Abdul Noor Ahmed (Cachar Distt.) followed by many of their friends and juniors, travelled from the east to west and north to south of Barak valley districts of Assam, organised meetings and thus created a wave of self-identity among the youths of this community.

Mr. Anwarul Hoque was the one and only member of Assam Legislative Assembly. (para 2–4 added by Fakhar Uddin Ahmed).He is also a great social worker and takingthe community foreword.
The Maimal have set up a statewide community association, the Maimal Federation, which deals with issues of community welfare. They are [[Sunni]] [[Muslim]]s, and have customs similar to other [[Assamese Muslim]]s.

'''Malaysian Mandarin''' ({{zh|t=馬來西亞華語|s=马来西亚华语|first=s|p=Mǎláixīyà Huáyǔ}}) is a variety of [[Mandarin Chinese]] spoken in Malaysia by ethnic Chinese in Malaysia. Malaysian Chinese tend to perceive the Mandarin Chinese is a variation of [[Standard Chinese|Standard Mandarin]] (Putonghua); however, it is a Mandarin dialect in its own right. Its closest linguistic cousin is not [[Standard Chinese|Standard Mandarin]], rather it is [[Singaporean Mandarin]], the variety widely used in films like [[:zh:大日子 (電影)|Tiger Woohoo 大日子(2010)]], [[Namewee]]'s ''[[Nasi Lemak 2.0]]'' and movies created by Singaporean movie director [[Jack Neo]]. 

Malaysian Mandarin speakers seldom translate local terms or names to Mandarin when they speak. They would prefer to verbally use [[Malay language|Malay]] place name in its original Malay pronunciation, for instance, even though the street name "Jalan Bukit Kepong" is written as "惹兰武吉甲洞" (''rělán wǔjí jiǎdòng'') in local Chinese printed media, the local Chinese almost never use ''rělán wǔjí jiǎdòng'' in daily conversations.  There are exceptions, for example [[Taiping, Perak|Taiping]], since this name is derived from the Chinese language, when people mention this place when speaking local Mandarin, they always use its Mandarin pronunciation, "Tàipíng", instead of using its Malay pronunciation, which is closer to "Taipeng".  Another examples is when a place's Chinese translation varied vastly with its native Malay name, for example: for [[Teluk Intan]], [[Seremban]] and [[Kota Kinabalu]], they are preferably referred respectively as ''Ānsùn'' (安順) (which refers to "Teluk Anson", Teluk Intan's former colonial name), ''Fúróng'' (芙蓉) and ''Yàbì'' (亞庇).

In comparison with Chinese, Taiwanese or even Singaporean Mandarin, Malaysian Mandarin is clearly distinguished by its relatively tonally 'flat' sound as well as its extensive use of glottal stops and the "[[checked tone]]".  This results in a distinct "clipped" sound compared to other forms of Mandarin.

==Demographics==
As of 2014 93% of ethnic Chinese families in Malaysia speak varieties of Chinese, which includes Mandarin.&lt;ref&gt;Saiful Bahri Kamaruddin. "[http://www.ukm.my/news/index.php/research-news/1793-research-found-malaysian-chinese-do-not-give-due-attention-to-bahasa-malaysia-usage.html Research Found Malaysian Chinese Do Not Give Due Attention To Bahasa Malaysia Usage]" ([https://www.webcitation.org/6WwHSUKOb Archive]). [[National University of Malaysia]]. 27 May 2014. Retrieved on 11 March 2015. "She also found 93% of Malaysian families of Chinese origin speak Mandarin with many different combinations of dialects and currently 53% of the respondents speak Chinese dialects with their parents compared with 42% in 1970."&lt;/ref&gt;

==Some differences between Malaysian Mandarin and Putonghua (Mandarin in China)==
* Jalan Bukit Kepong – 惹兰武吉甲洞 ''rělán wǔjí jiǎdòng''
* Raja Abdullah – 拉惹亚都拉 ''lārě yàdūlā''
* Kuih Talam – 达兰糕 ''dálán gāo''
* Roti Canai – 印度煎饼 ''Yìndù jiānbǐng''

==Early Ming and Qing immigrants==
The majority of ethnic Chinese people living in Malaysia came from China during the [[Ming Dynasty|Ming]] and [[Qing]] dynasties, between the 15th and early 20th centuries. Earlier immigrants married Malays and assimilated to a larger extent than later waves of migrants - they form a distinct sub-ethnic group, known as the [[Peranakan]]s and their descendants speak Malay.

The majority of immigrants were speakers of [[Hokkien]] ([[Min Nan]]), [[Standard Cantonese|Cantonese]], [[Hakka Chinese|Hakka]], [[Teochew language|Teochew]], and [[Hainanese]]. In the 19th century, Qing immigrants to Malaya had no single common language and were mostly uneducated peasants, and they tended to cluster themselves according to the ethno-linguistic group, usually corresponding to their place of origin, and worked with relatives and other speakers of the same language. In 1879, according to Isabella Bird, a visitor to the tin mining boomtown of [[Taiping, Perak|Taiping]], [[Perak]], "five dialects of Chinese are spoken, and Chinamen constantly communicate with each other in Malay, because they can't understand each other's Chinese".&lt;ref&gt;[The Encyclopedia of Malaysia: Languages &amp; Literature by Prof. Dato' Dr Asmah Haji Omar (2004) {{ISBN|981-3018-52-6}}.]&lt;/ref&gt; 

The Chinese languages spoken in Malaysia have over the years become localized (e.g. [[Penang Hokkien]]), as is apparent from the use of [[Malay language|Malay]] and [[English language|English]] loan words. Words from other Chinese languages are also injected, depending on the educational and cultural background of the speaker (see [[Education in Malaysia]] and [[Bahasa Rojak|Rojak language]]). Mandarin in Malaysia has also been localized, as a result of the influence of other Chinese variants spoken in Malaysia, rather than the Malay language. Loan words were discouraged in Mandarin instructions at local Chinese school and was regarded as mispronunciations.

===Examples===
* Angela, 你们不是应该要拿那个 'form'（表格） 先, 然后才去四楼那个 'counter'（柜台） 的 meh（吗）? (Angela, do you need to get that form before going to the counter in 4/F?)
* 刚刚从 Penang （槟城） 回来, 那里的 traffic (交通） '死伯'(很) ([[Hokkien|泉漳片闽南]])够力(始料不及的),'敢敢'（竟然）跟你塞两个多小时 '那种', 现在 '讲真的' 我很 'Sian'(烦) 了. (I just come back here from Penang, and the traffic is unexpected, which dare to get me congested for more than 2 hours!. Now, really, I'm pissed!)
* 黑色 body(体) 的那个跟它 '马是'（也是）一样的, 我看你们重 '砍' 了, 又. (The one with black body is the same (product) also. It seems that you bid the price up again!)
* Eh，你要不要我帮你叫CAB（出租车）？ (Eh, do you want me to help you call a cab?)
* 唉，讲到这件事我就很'死伯' ([[Hokkien|泉漳片闽南]])不爽。 (Ai! I'm pissed whenever someone mentions this (certain event.))
* 哇，你不sian（闷，烦）我都sian咯。

'''''Manda Bala (Send a Bullet)''''' is an American [[documentary film]] directed by Jason Kohn about [[Political corruption|corruption]] and [[kidnapping]] in [[Brazil]].

Kohn has said "I really thought of ''Manda Bala'' as a non-fiction ''[[RoboCop]]'' depicting a very real, broken, and violent society."&lt;ref name=indiewire0127&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indiewire.com/ots/2007/01/_park_city_07_p.html |title=Padre Nuestro and Manda Bala Win Top Prizes at Sundance '07 |accessdate=2007-01-30 |date=2007-01-27 |publisher=IndieWIRE.com |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070203071121/http://www.indiewire.com/ots/2007/01/_park_city_07_p.html &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2007-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; It premiered January 20, 2007 at the [[2007 Sundance Film Festival]] where it won the Grand Jury Prize for Documentary and the Excellence in Cinematography award. It had a limited release in North America beginning on August 17, 2007. On March 18, 2008, ''Manda Bala'' won the award for Outstanding Achievement in Nonfiction Feature Filmmaking at the inaugural [[Cinema Eye Honors]].

== Synopsis ==
''Manda Bala'' profiles such subjects as a businessman who bullet-proofs his cars, a plastic surgeon who reconstructs the ears of kidnap victims, former Governor and Senator [[Jáder Barbalho]], a powerful Brazilian politician from the state of [[Pará]] who used a frog farm for [[money laundering]], and the owner of the frog farm himself (see [[SUDAM]]).

The film details many of the reasons for Brazil's corruption including the fact that politicians in office there are exempt from civilian court proceedings, with the consequence that they will never be punished for crimes they commit in office. Another factor — and the other driving point of the film — is the ubiquity of kidnapping in Brazil, which ensures that the likelihood of redressing these crimes is fairly low and that someone's enemies (political or otherwise) are apt to disappear fairly easily.

=== Interview subjects ===
; Frog Farmer: a frog farmer who genuinely enjoys his trade. His wife asked him to make a choice, keep her or keep the frogs. The frog farmer chose the frogs. The frog farms were used by Jader Barbalho to illegally launder money.
; Businessman: after telling a story about how he was robbed while sitting in traffic, he discusses how unsafe he feels driving in São Paulo and decided to start bulletproofing cars because being without a bulletproof car "would be crazy".
; Head of Kidnapping Unit: talks about how commonplace kidnappings are and how difficult they are to resolve successfully and his belief that the government should be involved in solving and preventing kidnappings. Also shows off some of his bullet scars from his dangerous line of work.
; Victim: a victim of a kidnapping who had her ears cut off goes into detail about how her captors made her sleep in cramped quarters with only a bucket to use the bathroom, a TV blaring Hitchcock films, and how they sent pieces of her ear to her family.
; Federal Police  Marshal: discusses the details of his investigation into the frog farm's money laundering and corruption and how the initial evidence was gathered against Jader Barbahlo.
; Kidnapper: Discusses how a kidnapping is planned and what happens when a person cannot pay their ransom and also about how he and his organization take care of the poor when they need it, paving streets, giving out food, and other various projects. He then compares himself to a politician that gives to the poor instead of the ones that are in place that have forgotten the poor. Not shown in the film, the kidnapper was later shot by the police in late 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0912590/trivia |title=Trivia for ''Manda Bala (Send a Bullet)'' |publisher=[[Internet Movie Database]] |accessdate=17 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
; Jader Barbalho: Discusses the Amazon region (the poorest region of Brazil), why SUDAM failed, and when the subject of the Frog Farm comes up, he responds that "I would need more time to talk to you about that, but this is....this is no" and promptly ends the interview.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11832">'''Market fundamentalism''' (also known as '''free market fundamentalism''') is a term applied to a strong belief in the ability of [[Regulatory_economics|unregulated]] ''[[laissez-faire]]'' or [[free market]] policies to solve most economic and social problems.&lt;ref name=Longview1&gt;[http://www.longviewinstitute.org/projects/marketfundamentalism/marketfundamentalism Block,Fred. ''Market Fundamentalism'', Longview Institute]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
Critics of laissez-faire policies have used the term to denote what they perceive as a misguided belief, or deliberate deception, that [[free market]]s provide the greatest possible equity and prosperity,&lt;ref name=Longview&gt;[http://www.longviewinstitute.org/projects/moral/sorcerersapprentice Block,Fred. ''Reframing the Political Battle: Market Fundamentalism vs. Moral Economy.'', Longview Institute]&lt;/ref&gt; and that any interference with the market process decreases social well being. Users of the term include adherents of [[Economic interventionism|interventionist]], [[mixed economy]], and [[Protectionism|protectionist]] positions,&lt;ref name="Miracle"&gt;[http://www.bidstrup.com/economics.htm Bidstrup, Scott. ''Free Market Fundamentalism: Friedman, Pinochet and the "Chilean Miracle"'', Revised 10/15/02]&lt;/ref&gt; as well as billionaires such as [[George Soros]],&lt;ref name="Warns"&gt;[http://www.wsws.org/articles/1998/dec1998/soro-d22.shtml Beams, Nick. ''Soros warns of "market fundamentalism"''. WSWS : News &amp; Analysis : World Economy 22 December 1998]&lt;/ref&gt; economists such as Nobel Laureates [[Joseph Stiglitz]]&lt;ref name="Redifining"&gt;[http://www2.gsb.columbia.edu/faculty/jstiglitz/download/2001_World_Economics.pdf Stiglitz, Joseph. ''Redefining the Role of the State - What should it do ?  How should it do it ? And how should these decisions be made?'' Paper presented at the Tenth Anniversary of MITI Research Institute, Tokyo, March 1998.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080529110008/http://www2.gsb.columbia.edu/faculty/jstiglitz/download/2001_World_Economics.pdf |date=2008-05-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Paul Krugman]], and [[Cornell University]] historian [[Edward E. Baptist]]. George Soros suggests that market fundamentalism includes the belief that the best interests in a given society are achieved by allowing its participants to pursue their own financial self-interest with no restraint or regulatory oversight.&lt;ref name=Longview1/&gt;&lt;ref name=Worstcrisis&gt;[[George Soros|Soros, George]], [http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/24f73610-c91e-11dc-9807-000077b07658.html "The worst market crisis in 60 years.]" ''[[Financial Times]]'', January 22, 2008 19:57&lt;/ref&gt; Critics claim that in modern society with worldwide conglomerates, or even merely large companies, the individual has no protection against fraud nor harm caused by products that maximize income by imposing [[externality|externalities]] on the individual consumer as well as society. Historian [[Edward E. Baptist]] contends "unrestrained domination of market forces can sometimes amplify existing forms of oppression into something more horrific", such as [[slavery]], and that "market fundamentalism doesn't always provide the best solution for every economic or social problem".&lt;ref&gt;Edward Baptist (September 7, 2014). [http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2014/09/economist-review-slavery-110687.html#.VWB1Kk9Viko What the ''Economist'' Doesn't Get About Slavery—And My Book]. ''[[Politico]].'' Retrieved May 23, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to economist [[John Quiggin]], the standard features of economic fundamentalist rhetoric are [[dogma]]tic assertions combined with the claim that anyone who holds contrary views is not a real economist.&lt;ref name=Dogma&gt;[[John Quiggin|Quiggin, John]]. ''Rationalism and Rationality in Economics'', 1999, On Line Opinion,www.onlineopinion.com.au&lt;/ref&gt; However, Kozul-Wright states in his book ''The Resistible Rise of Market Fundamentalism'' that "ineluctability of market forces" [[Neoliberalism|neo-liberal]]s and conservative politicians tend to stress, and their confidence on a chosen policy, rest on a "mixture of implicit and hidden [[Economics#Criticism of assumptions|assumptions]], myths about the history of their own countries' economic development, and special interests camouflaged in their rhetoric of general good".&lt;ref name=Resistible&gt;Kozul-Wright, Richard and Rayment, Paul. ''The Resistible Rise of Market Fundamentalism: Rethinking Development Policy in an Unbalanced World''. London: Zed Books Ltd, 2007 p. 14 and Chapter 6&lt;/ref&gt;

==History of the term==
The expression "market fundamentalism" was popularized by business magnate and philanthropist [[George Soros]] in his book ''[[The Crisis of Global Capitalism]]'' (1998),&lt;ref name=Soros1&gt;[http://www.dollarsandsense.org/archives/1999/0199breslow.html Breslow, Marc. ''George Soros: Beware Market Fundamentalism''. Dollars &amp; Sense, issue #221, January-February 1999]&lt;/ref&gt;  in which he writes: "This idea was called [[laissez faire]] in the nineteenth century&amp;nbsp;... I have found a better name for it: market fundamentalism".&lt;ref name=Soros2&gt;Soros, George. ''The Crisis of Global Capitalism'' Public Affairs, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[P. Sainath]] believes [[Jeremy Seabrook]], a journalist and campaigner, first used the term.&lt;ref name=Firstuse&gt;[http://www.india-seminar.com/2001/497/497%20p.%20sainath.htm  Sainath, P. ''And then there was the market.'']&lt;/ref&gt; The term was used by [[John Langmore]] and [[John Quiggin]] in their 1994 book ''Work for All''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Quiggin|first=John|title=Work For All – Reply|url=http://www.uq.edu.au/economics/johnquiggin/JournalArticles95/WFA95.html|accessdate=30 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; See also Jonathan Benthall, 1991.&lt;ref&gt;Benthall, Jonathan, 'Inside information on "the market"', ''Anthropology Today'', 7.4, August 1991, pp.1–2.&lt;/ref&gt;

The expression is now used by various authors writing on economic topics to signify an allegedly unjustified belief in the ability of markets to solve all problems in a society.&lt;ref name=Definition&gt;[http://www.123exp-beliefs.com/t/00804280297/ ''Market fundamentalism'' The Language of Philosophy - Dictionary and Research Guide, Enlexica, Inc.]{{dead link|date=June 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; The term has been used to criticize groups which are viewed as advocating strongly against ''any'' state regulation and which defend a ''totally'' free market.&lt;ref name="Definition"/&gt; It is also used to disparage the arguments of the proponents of "the virtues of radical free-market economics" or, in Soros' own words, against the "[[ideology]]" which "has put financial capital into the driver's seat."&lt;ref name="Soros2"/&gt;

[[Joseph E. Stiglitz]] used the term in his autobiographical essay in acceptance of [[Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences]] to criticize some [[International Monetary Fund]] policies: "More broadly, the IMF was advocating a set of policies which is generally referred to alternatively as the [[Washington consensus]], the neo-liberal doctrines, or market fundamentalism, based on an incorrect understanding of economic theory and (what I viewed) as an inadequate interpretation of the historical data."&lt;ref name=Stiglitz&gt;[http://www.nobel.se/economics/laureates/2001/stiglitz-autobio.html Autobiographical essay in acceptance of the Bank of Sweden Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|The theories that I (and others) helped develop explained why unfettered markets often not only do not lead to social justice, but do not even produce efficient outcomes. Interestingly, there has been no intellectual challenge to the refutation of Adam Smith's [[invisible hand]]: individuals and firms, in the pursuit of their self-interest, are not necessarily, or in general, led as if by an invisible hand, to economic efficiency.&lt;ref name=Pact&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.beppegrillo.it/eng/2007/01/stiglitz.html |title=Stiglitz, Joseph E.

Several cases of mass sexual assault have been reported in India. In July 2012, a teenage girl was sexually assaulted for up to 45 minutes by a large group of men outside a bar in Guwahati, Assam. No one intervened until the police arrived.&lt;ref&gt;Helen Pidd, [https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/jul/15/india-media-sexual-assault-girl "Indian anger over media footage of girl being sexually assaulted"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170202121200/https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/jul/15/india-media-sexual-assault-girl |date=2017-02-02 }}, ''The Guardian'', 15 July 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[2002 riots in Gujarat]], targeted violence against Muslim women and children documented by civil society groups reported "mass rapes, live burials and burnings, acid attacks, impaling, and other brutal forms of torture that was deeply gendered, and linked violence against women with violence on their children – both born and unborn".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Jacob|first1=Cecilia|editor1-last=D'Costa|editor1-first=Bina|title=Children and Violence - Politics of Conflict in South Asia|date=October 2016|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|isbn=9781107117242|page=203|chapter=Children Affected by Political Violence in India}}&lt;/ref&gt; Survivors reported "that sexual violence consisted of forced nudity, mass rapes, gang-rapes, mutilation, insertion of objects into bodies, cutting of breasts, slitting the stomach and reproductive organs, and carving of Hindu religious symbols on women's body parts.&lt;ref name="Renu Khanna 2008"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Khanna|first=Renu|title=Communal Violence in Gujarat, India: Impact of Sexual Violence and Responsibilities of the Health Care System|journal=Reproductive Health Matters|year=2008|volume=16|issue=31|page=14|doi=10.1016/s0968-8080(08)31357-3}}

Female participants at ''We Are Sthlm'', a summer music festival for teenagers in Stockholm, reported in 2014 and 2015 that they had been surrounded and molested by groups of males, mostly teenage boys. Police were accused of having failed to publicize the attacks because the suspects were mostly from Afghanistan. The incidents came to light only after the 2016 New Year's Eve attacks in Germany when the Stockholm Police were accused of covering up the incidents, which they denied.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Assaults at the Stockholm festival have never been fully investigated|url=http://www.dn.se/nyheter/sverige/assaults-at-the-stockholm-festival-have-never-been-fully-investigated/|work=Dagens Nyheter|date=11 January 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160112031958/http://www.dn.se/nyheter/sverige/assaults-at-the-stockholm-festival-have-never-been-fully-investigated/|archivedate=12 January 2016|df=}}{{pb}}

Angelo Besso was born in [[Riesbach]] from a family of [[Italian Jews|Italian Jewish]] ([[Sephardi]]) descent. He was a close friend of [[Albert Einstein]] during his years at the [[Federal Polytechnic Institute]] in Zurich,&lt;ref&gt;[http://faculty.chemistry.harvard.edu/files/dudley-herschbach/files/einstein_student_new_0.pdf Einstein as a Student]&lt;/ref&gt; today the ETH Zurich, and then at the patent office in [[Bern]], where Einstein helped him to get a job.&lt;ref&gt;''An Einstein Encyclopedia'', Alice Calaprice, Daniel Kennefick, Robert Schulmann, p.65, Princeton University Press, 2015&lt;/ref&gt; Besso is credited with introducing Einstein to the works of [[Ernst Mach]], the sceptical critic of physics who influenced Einstein's approach to the discipline.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aip.org/history/einstein/early2.htm Einstein the Early years]&lt;/ref&gt; Einstein called Besso "the best sounding board in Europe" for scientific ideas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Albert Einstein: A Biography |last1=Calaprice  |first1=Alice |last2=Lipscombe |first2=Trevor |publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group |date=2005 |page=24}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Einstein's original paper on Special Relativity, he ended the paper stating, "In conclusion I wish to say that in working at the problem here dealt with I have had the loyal assistance of my friend and colleague M. Besso, and that I am indebted to him for several valuable suggestions."&lt;ref&gt;https://www.fourmilab.ch/etexts/einstein/specrel/www/#tex2html7&lt;/ref&gt;

Besso died in [[Geneva]], aged 81. In a letter of condolence to the Besso family, Albert Einstein wrote "Now he has departed from this strange world a little ahead of me. That means nothing. People like us, who believe in physics, know that the distinction between past, present and future is only a stubbornly persistent illusion." Einstein died one month and 3 days after his friend, on 18 April 1955.

'''Modern Hebrew''' or '''Israeli Hebrew''' ({{Hebrew|עברית חדשה|rtl=yes}}, ''ʿivrít ḥadašá[h]'', {{IPA-he|ivˈʁit χadaˈʃa|}} – "Modern Hebrew" or "New Hebrew"), generally referred to by speakers simply as '''Hebrew''' ({{Hebrew|עברית|rtl=yes}} ''Ivrit''), is the standard form of the [[Hebrew language]] spoken today. Spoken in ancient times, [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]], a member of the [[Canaanite languages|Canaanite]] branch of the [[Semitic languages|Semitic]] language family, was supplanted as the Jewish vernacular by the western dialect of [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]] beginning in the third century BCE, though it continued to be used as a liturgical and literary language. It was [[Revival of the Hebrew language|revived as a spoken language]] in the 19th and 20th centuries and is the official language of [[Israel]].

Modern Hebrew is spoken by about nine million people, counting native, fluent, and non-fluent speakers.&lt;ref name=israel-hayom-hebrew-speakers&gt;{{cite news|last=Klein|first=Zeev|title=A million and a half Israelis struggle with Hebrew|url=http://www.israelhayom.com/site/newsletter_article.php?id=8065|accessdate=2 November 2013|newspaper=[[Israel Hayom]]|date=March 18, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Behadrey-Haredim&gt;{{cite web|authors=Nachman Gur, Behadrey Haredim|title=Kometz Aleph&amp;nbsp;– Au• How many Hebrew speakers are there in the world?|url=http://www.bhol.co.il/article_en.aspx?id=52405|accessdate=2 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most speakers are [[Israelis|citizens of Israel]]: about five million are Israelis who speak Modern Hebrew as their native language, 1.5 million are immigrants to Israel, 1.5 million are [[Arab citizens of Israel]], whose first language is usually Arabic, and half a million are [[Yerida|expatriate Israelis]] or diaspora Jews living outside Israel.

The organization that officially directs the development of the Modern Hebrew language, under the law of the State of Israel, is the [[Academy of the Hebrew Language]].

==Name==
The most common scholarly term for the language is "Modern Hebrew" ({{lang|he|עברית חדשה|rtl=yes}} ''ʿivrít ħadašá[h]''). Most people refer to it simply as ''Hebrew'' ({{lang|he|עברית|rtl=yes}} ''Ivrit'').&lt;ref name=Dekel1&gt;{{harvnb|Dekel|2014}}; quote: "Most people refer to Israeli Hebrew simply as Hebrew. Hebrew is a broad term, which includes Hebrew as it was spoken and written in different periods of time and according to most of the researchers as it is spoken and written in Israel and elsewhere today. Several names have been proposed for the language spoken in Israel nowadays, Modern Hebrew is the most common one, addressing the latest spoken language variety in Israel (Berman 1978, Saenz-Badillos 1993:269, Coffin-Amir &amp; Bolozky 2005, Schwarzwald 2009:61). The emergence of a new language in Palestine at the end of the nineteenth century was associated with debates regarding the characteristics of that language.... Not all scholars supported the term Modern Hebrew for the new language. Rosén (1977:17) rejected the term Modern Hebrew, since linguistically he claimed that 'modern' should represent a linguistic entity that should command autonomy towards everything that preceded it, while this was not the case in the new emerging language. He also rejected the term Neo-Hebrew, because the prefix 'neo' had been previously used for Mishnaic and Medieval Hebrew (Rosén 1977:15–16), additionally, he rejected the term Spoken Hebrew as one of the possible proposals (Rosén 1977:18). Rosén supported the term Israeli Hebrew as in his opinion it represented the non-chronological nature of Hebrew, as well as its territorial independence (Rosén 1977:18). Rosén then adopted the term Contemporary Hebrew from Téne (1968) for its neutrality, and suggested the broadening of this term to Contemporary Israeli Hebrew (Rosén 1977:19)"&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "Modern Hebrew" has been described as "somewhat problematic"&lt;ref name=Matras1&gt;{{harvnb|Matras|Schiff|2005}}; quote: The language with which we are concerned in this contribution is also known by the names Contemporary Hebrew and Modern Hebrew, both somewhat problematic terms as they rely on the notion of an unambiguous periodization separating Classical or Biblical Hebrew from the present-day language. We follow instead the now widely-used label coined by Rosén (1955), Israeli Hebrew, to denote the link between the emergence of a Hebrew vernacular and the emergence of an Israeli national identity in Israel/Palestine in the early twentieth century."&lt;/ref&gt; as it implies unambiguous [[periodization]] from [[Biblical Hebrew]].&lt;ref name=Matras1/&gt; [[:he:חיים רוזן|Haiim B. Rosén &lt;small&gt;(he)&lt;/small&gt;]] supported the now widely used&lt;ref name="Matras1" /&gt; term "Israeli Hebrew" on the basis that it "represented the non-chronological nature of Hebrew".&lt;ref name="Dekel1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Rosen15"&gt;{{cite book|author=Haiim Rosén|title=Contemporary Hebrew|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PydwqOHyCMAC&amp;pg=PA29|date=1 January 1977|publisher=Walter de Gruyter|isbn=978-3-11-080483-6|pages=15–18}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1999, Israeli linguist [[Ghil'ad Zuckermann]] proposed the term "Israeli" to represent the multiple origins of the language.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ghil'ad Zuckermann|Zuckermann, G.]] (1999), "Review of the Oxford English-Hebrew Dictionary", ''International Journal of Lexicography'', Vol. 12, No. 4, pp. 325-346&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|325}}&lt;ref name="Dekel1"/&gt;

==Background==
{{main|Hebrew language}}
One can divide the history of the Hebrew language into four major periods:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/259061/Hebrew-language#ref267079 Hebrew language] ''Encyclopædia Britannica''&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Biblical Hebrew]], until about the 3rd century BCE; the language of most of the [[Hebrew Bible]]
* [[Mishnaic Hebrew]], the language of the [[Mishnah]] and [[Talmud]]
* [[Medieval Hebrew]], from about the 6th to the 13th century CE
* Modern Hebrew, the language of the modern State of Israel.

Jewish contemporary sources describe Hebrew flourishing as a spoken language in the [[History of ancient Israel and Judah|kingdoms of Israel and Judah]], during about 1200 to 586 BCE.&lt;ref&gt;אברהם בן יוסף ,מבוא לתולדות הלשון העברית (Avraham ben-Yosef, Introduction to the History of the Hebrew Language), page 38, אור-עם, Tel Aviv, 1981.&lt;/ref&gt; Scholars debate the degree to which Hebrew remained a spoken vernacular following the [[Babylonian captivity]], when [[Old Aramaic language|Old Aramaic]] became the predominant international language in the region.

Hebrew [[language death|died out]] as a vernacular language somewhere between 200 and 400 CE, declining after the [[Bar Kokhba revolt]] of 132–136 CE, which devastated the population of [[Judea]]. After [[History of the Jews in the Roman Empire|the exile]] Hebrew became restricted to [[liturgical]] use.&lt;ref&gt;Sáenz-Badillos, Ángel and John Elwolde: "There is general agreement that two main periods of RH (Rabbinical Hebrew) can be distinguished. The first, which lasted until the close of the Tannaitic era (around 200 CE), is characterized by RH as a spoken language gradually developing into a literary medium in which the Mishnah, Tosefta, ''baraitot'' and Tannaitic ''midrashim'' would be composed. The second stage begins with the ''[[Amoraim]]'' and sees RH being replaced by Aramaic as the spoken vernacular, surviving only as a literary language. Then it continued to be used in later rabbinic writings until the tenth century in, for example, the Hebrew portions of the two Talmuds and in midrashic and haggadic literature."&lt;/ref&gt;

== Revival ==&lt;!--This section is linked from [[Yemenite Hebrew]] ([[MOS:HEAD]])--&gt;
{{Main|Revival of the Hebrew language}}

Hebrew had been spoken at various times and for a number of purposes throughout the Diaspora, and during the [[Old Yishuv]] it had developed into a spoken [[lingua franca]] among the [[Palestinian Jews|Jews of Palestine]].&lt;ref&gt;TUDOR PARFITT; THE CONTRIBUTION OF THE OLD YISHUV TO THE REVIVAL OF HEBREW, Journal of Semitic Studies, Volume XXIX, Issue 2, 1 October 1984, Pages 255–265, https://doi.org/10.1093/jss/XXIX.2.255&lt;/ref&gt; [[Eliezer Ben-Yehuda]] then led a [[revival of the Hebrew language]] as a mother tongue in the late 19th century and early 20th century. Modern Hebrew used Biblical Hebrew [[morpheme]]s, Mishnaic spelling, and Sephardic pronunciation. Many [[Idiomatic language|idioms]] and [[calque]]s were made from [[Yiddish]]. Its acceptance by the early Jewish immigrants to [[Mutasarrifate of Jerusalem|Ottoman Palestine]] was primarily due to support from the organisations of [[Edmond James de Rothschild]] in the 1880s and the official status it received in the 1922 constitution of the [[British Mandate for Palestine (legal instrument)|British Mandate for Palestine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|ref=harv|last=Hobsbawm|first=Eric|authorlink=Eric Hobsbawm|title=Nations and Nationalism since 1780: Programme, Myth, Reality|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AcYLAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA113|year=2012|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-1-107-39446-9}}, "What would the future of Hebrew have been, had not the British Mandate in 1919 accepted it as one of the three official languages of Palestine, at a time when the number of people speaking Hebrew as an everyday language was less than 20,000?"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|ref=harv|last=Swirski|first=Shlomo|title=Politics and Education in Israel: Comparisons with the United States|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2DOPAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA30|date=11 September 2002|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-135-58242-5}}: "In retrospect, [Hobsbawm's] question should be rephrased, substituting the Rothschild house for the British state and the 1880s for 1919. For by the time the British conquered Palestine, Hebrew had become the everyday language of a small but well-entrenched community."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[s:Palestine Mandate|Palestine Mandate]] (1922): "English, Arabic and Hebrew shall be the official languages of Palestine"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Harshav1999"&gt;{{cite book|author=Benjamin Harshav|title=Language in Time of Revolution|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HPwR7pmx84IC&amp;pg=PA85|year=1999|publisher=Stanford University Press|isbn=978-0-8047-3540-7|pages=85–}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jews from Arab lands introduced many loanwords from Arabic (e.g. ''[[Mentha|na'ana]]'', ''[[zaatar]]'', ''[[Apricot|mishmish]]'', ''[[Coriander|kusbara]]'', ''[[Fenugreek|ḥilba]]'', ''[[Vigna unguiculata subsp. unguiculata|lubiya]]'', ''[[hummus]]'', ''[[Carrot|gezer]]'', ''[[Basil|rayḥan]]'', etc.). The words ''gerev'' (sing.) / ''garbayim'' (pl.) are now applied to "socks," a diminutive of the Arabic ''ğuwārib'' ("socks").&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Rabbi [[Hai Gaon]]'s commentary on [[Mishnah]] ''Kelim'' 27:6, where '''אמפליא''' (''ampalya'') was used formerly for the same, and had the equivalent meaning of the Arabic word ''ğuwārib'' ("stockings; socks").&lt;/ref&gt; Ben-Yehuda codified and planned Modern Hebrew using 8,000 words from the Bible and 20,000 words from rabbinical commentaries.&lt;ref&gt;Roberto Garvio, ''Esperanto and its Rivals, University of Pennsylvania Press'', 2015, p. 164&lt;/ref&gt; He also invented some words, such as ''ḥatzilīm'' for [[eggplant]]s (aubergines) and ''ḥashmal'' for electricity.&lt;ref&gt;Which words are marked as "New Words" in the [[Even-Shoshan Dictionary|Even-Shoshan Hebrew Dictionary]], s.v. '''חצילים'''; see: [[Nathan ben Abraham I#Modern Hebrew usages|Modern Hebrew usages]]. ''Ḥashmal'' is found only once in the Hebrew Bible, in Ezekiel's vision of the chariot (Ezek. 1:4; 1:27), but has been explained in a medieval Judeo-Arabic lexicon (reprinted in the book, ''Jewish Culture in Muslim Lands and Cairo Geniza Studies'', ed. Yosef Tobi, Tel-Aviv University: Tel-Aviv 2006, p. 61 [note 114]) as being some angelic entity which had "utmost strength". Others have explained it to mean an angel that changes hues.&lt;/ref&gt; As no Hebrew equivalent could be found for the names of certain produce endemic to the [[New World]], they devised new Hebrew words for [[maize]] and [[tomato]], calling them ''tiras'' (Heb. '''תירס''') and ''ʿagḇaniyyah'' (Heb. '''עגבניה'''), respectively. The latter word is derived from the shape of the vegetable, which resembled a buttocks (Heb. ''ʿagaḇīm''). Sometimes, old Hebrew words took on different meanings altogether. For example, the Hebrew word ''kǝvīš'' ({{lang|he|'''כביש'''|rtl=yes}}), which now denotes a "street" or a "road," is actually an [[Aramaic]] adjective meaning "trodden down; blazoned", rather than a common noun. It was originally used to describe "a ''blazoned'' trail."&lt;ref&gt;Compare [[Rashi]]'s commentary on Exodus 9:17, where he says the word ''mesillah'' is translated in Aramaic ''oraḥ kevīsha'' (A blazoned trail); the word "kevīsh" being only an adjective or descriptive word, but not a common noun as it is used today. It is said that [[Ze'ev Yavetz]] (1847&amp;ndash;1924) is he that coined this modern Hebrew word for “road.” See [http://www.haaretz.com/jewish-world/jewish-world-features/with-tu-bishvat-near-a-tree-grows-in-zichron-yaakov.premium-1.496141 Haaretz, Contributions made by Ze'ev Yavetz]; {{cite news | last =Maltz | first =Judy | coauthors = | title =With Tu Bishvat Near, a Tree Grows in Zichron Yaakov| work = | pages = | language = English|publisher =Haaretz | date =25 January 2013 | url = http://www.haaretz.com/jewish/features/with-tu-bishvat-near-a-tree-grows-in-zichron-yaakov.premium-1.496141?=&amp;ts=_1490626484939 | accessdate =27 March 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the phenomena seen with the revival of the Hebrew language is that, occasionally, old meanings of words were changed for altogether different meanings, such as ''bardelas'' ({{lang|he|'''ברדלס'''|rtl=yes}}), which in Mishnaic Hebrew meant "[[hyena]]",&lt;ref&gt;Maimonides' commentary and Rabbi [[Ovadiah Bartenurah|Ovadiah of Bartenura]]'s commentary on Mishnah ''Baba Kama'' 1:4; Rabbi [[Nathan ben Abraham I|Nathan ben Abraham]]'s Mishnah Commentary, ''Baba Metzia'' 7:9, s.v.

'''ברדלס'''; Zohar Amar, ''Flora and Fauna in Maimonides' Teachings'', Kefar Darom 2015, pp. 177–178; 228&lt;/ref&gt; but in Modern Hebrew now means "[[cheetah]];" or ''shezīph'' ({{lang|he|'''שְׁזִיף'''|rtl=yes}}) which is now used for "[[plum]]," but formerly meant "[[jujube]]."&lt;ref&gt;Zohar Amar, ''Flora and Fauna in Maimonides' Teachings'', Kfar Darom 2015, p. 157, s.v. '''שזפין''' {{OCLC|783455868}}, explained to mean "jujube" (Ziziphus jujube); [[Solomon Sirilio]]'s Commentary of the Jerusalem Talmud, on ''Kila'im'' 1:4, s.v. '''השיזפין''', which he explained to mean in Spanish "azufaifas" (= "jujubes"). See also Saul Lieberman, Glossary in ''Tosephta'' - based on the Erfurt and Vienna Codices (ed. M.S. Zuckermandel), Jerusalem 1970, s.v. '''שיזפין''' (p. LXL), explained in German as meaning, "Brustbeerbaum" (= jujubes).&lt;/ref&gt; The word ''kishū’īm'' (formerly "cucumbers")&lt;ref&gt;Thus explained by Maimonides in his Commentary on [[Mishnah]] ''Kila'im'' 1:2 and in Mishnah ''Terumot'' 2:6. See: Zohar Amar, ''Flora and Fauna in Maimonides' Teachings'', Kefar Darom 2015, pp. 111, 149 (Hebrew) {{OCLC|783455868}}; Zohar Amar, ''Agricultural Produce in the Land of Israel in the Middle Ages'' (Hebrew title: '''גידולי ארץ-ישראל בימי הביניים'''), [[Ben-Zvi Institute]]: Jerusalem 2000, p. 286 {{ISBN|965-217-174-3}} (Hebrew)&lt;/ref&gt; is now applied to a variety of [[summer squash]] (Cucurbita pepo var. cylindrica), a plant native to the [[New World]].

== Alphabet ==
{{Main|Hebrew alphabet}}
Modern Hebrew is written from right to left using the [[Hebrew alphabet]], which is an [[abjad]], or consonant-only script of 22 letters based on the "square" letter form, known as ''Ashurit'' (Assyrian), which was developed from the [[Aramaic alphabet|Aramaic script]]. A [[Cursive Hebrew|cursive]] script is used in handwriting. When necessary, vowels are indicated by diacritic marks above or below the letters known as ''[[Niqqud|Nikkud]]'', or by use of ''[[Matres lectionis#Usage in Hebrew|Matres lectionis]]'', which are consonantal letters used as vowels. Further diacritics like [[Dagesh]] and [[Shin (letter)#Sin and Shin Dot|Sin and Shin dots]] are used to indicate variations in the pronunciation of the consonants (e.g. ''bet''/''vet'', ''shin''/''sin''). The letters "{{Hebrew|צ׳}}", "{{Hebrew|ג׳}}", "{{Hebrew|ז׳}}", each modified with a [[Geresh]], represent the consonants {{IPAblink|t͡ʃ}}, {{IPAblink|d͡ʒ}}, {{IPAblink|ʒ}}. {{IPAblink|t͡ʃ}} may also be written as "תש" and "טש". {{IPAblink|w}} is represented interchangeably by a simple vav "ו", non-standard double vav "וו" and sometimes by non-standard geresh modified vav "ו׳".

== Phonology ==
{{Main|Modern Hebrew phonology}}
Modern Hebrew has fewer phonemes than Biblical Hebrew but it has developed its own phonological complexity. Israeli Hebrew has 25 to 27 consonants&lt;!--depending on whether the speaker has pharyngeals--&gt; and 5 to 10 vowels&lt;!--depending on whether you count diphthongs and long vs short vowels--&gt;, depending on the speaker and the analysis.

The following table lists the consonant phonemes of Israeli Hebrew in [[International Phonetic Alphabet|IPA]] transcription:&lt;ref name=Dekel/&gt;

:&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; In modern Hebrew {{IPA|/ħ/}} for ח has been absorbed by {{IPA|/x~χ/}} that was traditionally only for fricative כ, though some older [[Mizrahi]] speakers still separate these.{{sfn|Dekel|2014}}
:&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; The glottal consonants are mostly elided in unstressed syllables, and sometimes also in stressed syllables as well, but are pronounced in careful or formal speech. In modern Hebrew {{IPA|/ʕ/}} for ע has merged with {{IPA|/ʔ/}} (א), though some speakers (particularly older [[Mizrahi]] speakers) still separate these.{{sfn|Dekel|2014}}
:&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; Commonly transcribed {{IPA|/r/}}. This is usually pronounced as a uvular fricative or approximant {{IPAblink|ʁ}} or velar fricative {{IPAblink|ɣ}}, and sometimes as a uvular {{IPAblink|ʀ}} or alveolar trill {{IPAblink|r}} or alveolar flap {{IPAblink|ɾ}}, depending on the background of the speaker.{{sfn|Dekel|2014}}
:&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; The phonemes {{IPA|/w, dʒ, ʒ/}} were introduced through borrowings.

[[Obstruent]]s often assimilate in voicing: voiceless obstruents ({{IPA|/p t ts tʃ k, f s ʃ x/}}) become voiced ({{IPA|[b d dz dʒ ɡ, v z ʒ ɣ]}}) when they appear immediately before voiced obstruents, and vice versa.

Hebrew has five basic vowel phonemes:

{| class="wikitable IPA"
|-
! !!front !! central !! back
|-
!high
| [[Close front unrounded vowel|i]]  ||  || [[Close back rounded vowel|u]]
|-
!mid
| [[Mid front unrounded vowel|e̞]]||  || [[Mid back rounded vowel|o̞]]
|-
!low
| || [[Open central unrounded vowel|ä]]  ||
|}

Long vowels occur unpredictably where two identical vowels were historically separated by a pharyngeal or glottal consonant, and the first was stressed.
Any of the five short vowels may be realized as a schwa {{IPA|[ə]}} when far from lexical stress.
There are two diphthongs, {{IPA|/aj/}} and {{IPA|/ej/}}.&lt;ref name=Dekel/&gt;

Most [[lexical word]]s have [[lexical stress]] on one of the last two syllables, of which the last syllable is the more frequent in formal speech. Loanwords may have stress on the antepenultimate syllable or even further back.

===Pronunciation===
While the pronunciation of Modern Hebrew is based on [[Sephardi Hebrew]], the pronunciation has been affected by the immigrant communities that have settled in Israel in the past century and there has been a general coalescing of speech patterns. The pharyngeal [{{IPAlink|ħ}}] for the phoneme ''chet'' ({{Lang-he-n|'''ח'''}}) of Sephardi Hebrew has merged into [{{IPAlink|χ}}] which Sephardi Hebrew only used for fricative ''chaf'' ({{Lang-he-n|'''כ'''}}). The pronunciation of the phoneme ''ayin'' ({{Lang-he-n|'''ע'''}}), has merged with the pronunciation of ''aleph'' ({{Lang-he-n|'''א'''}}) which is either [{{IPAlink|ʔ}}] or unrealized [∅] and has come to dominate Modern Hebrew; in many variations of liturgical Sephardi Hebrew, it is [{{IPAlink|ʕ}}], a [[voiced pharyngeal fricative]]. The letter ''vav'' ({{Lang-he-n|'''ו'''}}) is realized as [{{IPAlink|v}}], which is standard for both Ashkenazi and most variations of Sephardi Hebrew. The Jews of [[History of the Jews in Iraq|Iraq]], [[History of the Jews in Syria|Aleppo]], Yemen and some parts of North Africa pronounced ''vav'' as [{{IPAlink|w}}]. [[Yemenite Jews]], during their liturgical readings in the synagogues, will still make use of the older pronunciation of this Hebrew letter. The pronunciation of the letter ''resh'' ({{Lang-he-n|'''ר'''}}) has also largely shifted from Sephardi [{{IPAlink|r}}] to either [{{IPAlink|ɣ}}] or [{{IPAlink|ʁ}}].

== Morphology ==
Modern Hebrew [[Morphology (linguistics)|morphology]] (formation, structure, and interrelationship of words in a language) is essentially [[Biblical Hebrew|Biblical]].&lt;ref name="books.google.com"&gt;{{cite book |title=Handbook of Orthography and Literacy |editor=R. Malatesha Joshi |editor2=P. G. Aaron |publisher=Routledge |year=2013 |isbn=9781136781353 |page=343 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1xX-am4mqWoC&amp;pg=PA343&amp;lpg=PA343&amp;dq}}&lt;/ref&gt; Modern Hebrew showcases much of the inflectional morphology of the classical upon which it was based. In the formation of new words, all verbs and the majority of nouns and adjectives are formed by the classically Semitic devices of [[Semitic root|triconsonantal roots]] (''shoresh'') with [[nonconcatenative morphology|affixed patterns]] (''mishkal''). Mishnaic attributive patterns are often used to create nouns, and Classical patterns are often used to create adjectives. Blended words are created by merging two bound stems or parts of words.

== Syntax ==
The syntax of Modern Hebrew is mainly Mishnaic,&lt;ref name="books.google.com"/&gt; while also showing the influence of different contact languages to which its speakers have been exposed during the revival period and over the past century.

=== Word order ===
The word order of Modern Hebrew is predominately SVO ([[subject–verb–object]]). Biblical Hebrew was originally [[verb–subject–object]] (VSO), but drifted into SVO.&lt;ref&gt;Li, Charles N. ''Mechanisms of Syntactic Change''. Austin: U of Texas, 1977. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Modern Hebrew maintains classical syntactic properties associated with VSO languages—it is [[Preposition and postposition|prepositional]] rather than postpositional in making case and adverbial relations, [[auxiliary verb]]s precede main verbs; main verbs precede their complements, and noun modifiers ([[adjective]]s, [[determiner]]s other than the [[definite article]] {{Rtl-lang|he|ה-|ha|the}}, and [[noun adjunct]]s) follow the head noun, hence in [[genitive case|genitive]] constructions the possessee noun precedes the possessor. Moreover, Modern Hebrew allows and in cases requires sentences with a predicate initial.

== Lexicon ==
Modern Hebrew has expanded its vocabulary effectively to meet the needs of casual vernacular, of science and technology, of journalism and [[belles-lettres]]. According to [[Ghil'ad Zuckermann]]:

{{bq|The number of attested Biblical Hebrew words is 8198, of which some 2000 are [[hapax legomenon|hapax legomena]] (the number of Biblical Hebrew roots, on which many of these words are based, is 2099). The number of attested Rabbinic Hebrew words is less than 20,000, of which (i) 7879 are Rabbinic par excellence, i.e. they did not appear in the Old Testament (the number of new Rabbinic Hebrew roots is 805); (ii) around 6000 are a subset of Biblical Hebrew; and (iii) several thousand are Aramaic words which can have a Hebrew form. Medieval Hebrew added 6421 words to (Modern) Hebrew. The approximate number of new lexical items in Israeli is 17,000 (cf. 14,762 in Even-Shoshan 1970 [...]). With the inclusion of foreign and technical terms [...], the total number of Israeli words, including words of biblical, rabbinic and medieval descent, is more than 60,000.&lt;ref name="Zuckermann"&gt;[[Ghil'ad Zuckermann|Zuckermann, Ghil'ad]] (2003), [[Language Contact and Lexical Enrichment in Israeli Hebrew]]. [[Palgrave Macmillan]]. {{ISBN|978-1403917232}} [http://www.palgrave.com/br/book/9781403917232]&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|64–65}}}}

=== Loanwords ===
Modern Hebrew has loanwords from [[Arabic]] (both from the local [[Palestinian Arabic|Levantine dialect]] and from the [[Judeo-Arabic languages|dialects of Jewish immigrants from Arab countries]]), [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]], [[Yiddish]], [[Judaeo-Spanish]], [[German language|German]], [[Polish language|Polish]], [[Russian language|Russian]], [[English language|English]] and other languages. Simultaneously, Israeli Hebrew makes use of words that were originally loanwords from the languages of surrounding nations from ancient times: Canaanite languages as well as Akkadian. Mishnaic Hebrew borrowed many nouns from Aramaic, as well as some from Greek. In the Middle Ages, liturgical Hebrew borrowed heavily from Spanish, Greek, and Arabic. Some typical examples of Hebrew loanwords are:

'''Muktananda''' (16 May 1908&amp;nbsp;– 2 October 1982), born Krishna Rai, was the founder of [[Siddha Yoga]]. He was a disciple and the successor of [[Bhagawan Nityananda|Bhagavan Nityananda]].&lt;ref&gt;S.P. Sabharathnam Douglas Brooks. ''Meditation Revolution: A History and Theology of the Siddha Yoga Lineage''. Agama Press, 1997. {{ISBN|978-0-9654096-0-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote a number of books on the subjects of Kundalini Shakti, Vedanta, and Kashmir Shaivism, including a spiritual autobiography entitled ''The Play of Consciousness''. In [[honorific]] style, he is often referred to as ''[[Swami]] Muktananda''.

== Biography ==

Muktananda was born in 1908 near [[Mangalore]] in [[Karnataka|Karnataka State]], [[India]], to a well-off family. His birth name was Krishna Rai.&lt;ref name=HT&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.hinduismtoday.com/modules/smartsection/item.php?itemid=1170|title=Baba Muktananda's Meditation Revolution Continues Ten Years After His Passing|journal=Hinduism Today|date=October 1992|accessdate=1 June 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

At age 15 he encountered Bhagavan Nityananda, a wandering [[Avadhuta|avadhoot]] who profoundly changed his life.&lt;ref name=HT/&gt; After this encounter, Krishna left home and began his search for the experience of God.&lt;ref&gt;Douglas Brooks, Swami Durgananda, Paul E. Muller-Ortega, Constantina Rhodes Bailly, S.P. Sabharathnam. ''Meditation Revolution: a History and Theology of the Siddha Yoga lineage''. (Agama Press) 1997, p.32&lt;/ref&gt; He studied under Siddharudha Swami at [[Hubli]], where he learned [[Sanskrit]], [[Vedanta]], all branches of [[yoga]], and took the initiation of [[sannyasa]] in the [[Dashanami Sampradaya#Ten Names|Sarasvati order]] of the [[Dashanami Sampradaya]],&lt;ref&gt;John Paul Healy (2010), ''Yearning to Belong: Discovering a New Religious Movement'', Ashgate Publishing, Ltd., p.9&lt;/ref&gt; taking the name of Swami Muktananda. After Siddharudha's death, Muktananda then left to study with a disciple of Siddharudha called Muppinarya Swami at his Sri Airani Holematt in Ranebennur Haveri District after studying there Swami Muktananda began wandering India on foot, studying with many different saints and gurus.

In 1947 Muktananda went to [[Ganeshpur, Maharashtra|Ganeshpuri]] to receive the [[Darśana|darshan]] of Bhagavan Nityananda, the saint who had originally inspired Muktananda's search for God. He received [[shaktipat]] [[initiation]] from him at 15 August of that year. Muktananda often said that his spiritual journey didn't truly begin until he received [[shaktipat]] from the holy man Bhagavan Nityananda. According to his description, it was a profound and sublime experience.&lt;ref name=POC&gt;{{cite book|last=Muktananda|first=Swami|title=Play of Consciousness|year=1978|publisher=Siddha Yoga Publications|isbn=0-911307-81-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Muktananda spent the next nine years living and [[meditation|meditating]] in a little hut in [[Yeola]]. He wrote about his [[sadhana]] and [[Kundalini energy|kundalini]]-related meditation experiences, in his autobiography. 

In 1956, Bhagawan Nityananda acknowledged the culmination of Muktananda's spiritual journey, and gave him a small piece of land at Ganeshpuri, near [[Bombay]], instructing Muktananda to create an ashram there.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.answers.com/topic/swami-muktananda&lt;/ref&gt; The same year he started teaching his "Siddha Yoga" path. Between 1970 and 1981, Muktananda went on three world tours, establishing Siddha Yoga ashrams and meditation centers in many countries. In 1975, he founded the Siddha Yoga Ashram in Oakland, in the California Bay area, and in 1979 he established Shree Nityananda Ashram (now Shree Muktananda Ashram) in the Catskills Mountains, northwest of New York City.&lt;ref&gt;Brooks, Douglas; Durgananda, Swami; Muller-Ortega, Paul; Mahony, William; Rhodes-Bailly, Constantina; Sabharathnam, S.P. (1997).  Meditation Revolution:  A History and Theology of the Siddha Yoga Lineage; Agama Press; {{ISBN|0965409600}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Muktananda established [[Gurudev Siddha Peeth]] as a public trust in India to administer the work there, and founded the SYDA Foundation in the United States to administer the global work of Siddha Yoga meditation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.hinduismtoday.com/archives/1995/4/1995-4-05.shtml|title=Muktananda's Legacy|journal=Hinduism Today|date=April 1995|accessdate=1 June 2006 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060522190357/http://www.hinduismtoday.com/archives/1995/4/1995-4-05.shtml &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 22 May 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote many books; sixteen are still kept in print by the SYDA Foundation.

In May 1982, Muktananda appointed two successors as joint leaders of the Siddha Yoga path, [[Gurumayi_Chidvilasananda|Swami Chidvilasananda]] and her younger brother, Swami Nityananda who later resigned and formed his own group. Muktananda died in October 1982 and is buried at Ganeshpuri, where the Gurudev Siddha Peeth ashram houses his [[Samādhi#Samadhi as mausoleum|samādhi]] shrine.

In 1983, after Muktananda's death, William Rodarmor printed several accusations of physical and sexual abuse, in ''[[CoEvolution Quarterly]]'', from anonymous female devotees that Muktananda regularly had sex with them. He also charged that Muktananda had engaged in other behaviour at odds with wider societal norms.&lt;ref name=Rodarmor&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rodarmor|first=William|title=The Secret Life of Swami Muktananda|journal=CoEvolution Quarterly|year=1983|issue=winter|url=http://www.leavingsiddhayoga.net/secret.htm|format=Reprint}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Williamson115"&gt;Lola Williamson (2010), ''Transcendent in America: Hindu-inspired Meditation Movements as New Religion'', NYU Press, p.115&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;John Philip (2009), ''Yoga, Inc.: A Journey Through the Big Business of Yoga'', Penguin Group (Canada) (), p.179&lt;/ref&gt; These allegations were confirmed by other ''CoEvolution Quarterly'' journalists,&lt;ref name="Williamson115" /&gt; while [[Lis Harris]] repeated and extended Rodarmor's allegations in an article in ''[[The New Yorker]]'' (1994).&lt;ref&gt;Lis Harris, The New Yorker, O Guru, Guru, Guru, 14 November 1994&lt;/ref&gt; Lola Williamson notes that Muktananda "publicly stressed the value of celibacy for making progress on the spiritual path, but he almost certainly violated his own rules."&lt;ref&gt;Lola Williamson (2010), ''Transcendent in America: Hindu-inspired Meditation Movements as New Religion'', NYU Press, p.114&lt;/ref&gt;

Sarah Caldwell argued that Muktananda was both an enlightened spiritual teacher and a practitioner of Shakta Tantrism, but also "engaged in actions that were not ethical, legal or liberatory with many disciples."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| author= Sarah  Caldwell | title=The Heart of the Secret: A Personal and Scholarly Encounter with Shakta Tantrism in Siddha Yoga| journal= Nova Religio | year=2001 | volume=5 | issue=1 | pages= 9–51|url=https://www.jstor.org/discover/10.1525/nr.2001.5.1.9?uid=3739656&amp;uid=2&amp;uid=4&amp;uid=3739256&amp;sid=21101757004693|format=Reprint | doi=10.1525/nr.2001.5.1.9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Teaching and practice==
Central to his teachings were to "See God in each other,"&lt;ref name="Essential Teachings"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.siddhayoga.org/teachings/essential|title=Essential Teachings|accessdate=2014-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; and "Honor your Self. Worship your Self. Meditate on your Self. God dwells within you as you."&lt;ref name="Essential Teachings"/&gt; Muktananda often gave a shorter version of this teaching: "God dwells within you as you."&lt;ref&gt;Reverend Eugene S. Callender, Nobody is a Nobody,  (Amazon) 2010, p.290&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Lola Williamson, Muktananda was known as a "[[shaktipat]] guru because [[kundalini]] awakening occurred so readily in his presence".&lt;ref&gt;Homegrown Gurus, edited by Ann Gleig and Lola Williamson, chapter 4, Swamis, Scholars and Gurus by Lola Williamson, page 87&lt;/ref&gt; Through ''Shaktipat Intensives'' participants were said to receive shaktipat initiation, the awakening of Kundalini Shakti that is said to reside within a person, and to deepen their practice of Siddha Yoga meditation.&lt;ref&gt;Brooks, Douglas; Durgananda, Swami; Muller-Ortega, Paul; Mahony, William; Rhodes-Bailly, Constantina; Sabharathnam, S.P. (1997). Meditation Revolution:  A History and Theology of the Siddha Yoga Lineage; Agama Press; pp 135-152.  {{ISBN|0965409600}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Historically, Shaktipat initiation had been reserved for the few who had done many years of spiritual service and practices;  Muktananda offered this initiation to newcomers and yogis alike.&lt;ref&gt;Brooks, Douglas; Durgananda, Swami; Muller-Ortega, Paul; Mahony, William; Rhodes-Bailly, Constantina; Sabharathnam, S.P. (1997). Meditation Revolution:  A History and Theology of the Siddha Yoga Lineage; Agama Press; p 93.  {{ISBN|0965409600}}.&lt;/ref&gt; There are several published accounts that describe the reception of ''shaktipat'' from Muktananda. Paul Zweig wrote one such account of receiving ''shaktipat'' from Muktananda.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Zweig, in John White (editor), ''Kundalini, Evolution, and Enlightenment'' ({{ISBN|1-55778-303-9}})&lt;/ref&gt; In Gurus of Modern Yoga, Andrea Jain, in her chapter on Muktananda, quotes an anonymous source, who describes his moment of shaktipat, when he was 19 years old, conferred by Muktananda with a wand of peacock feathers in 1975:
{{quote|I almost jumped when the peacock feathers, firmly but with a soft weightiness, hit me repeatedly on my head, and then gently brushed my face as  [Muktananda] [...] powerfully pressed one of his fingers into my forehead at a spot located just between my eyebrows [...] I'm honestly somewhat reluctant to write about what happened next because I know that whatever I say will inevitably diminish it, will make it sound as if it were just another "powerful experience." This was not an experience. This was THE event of my spiritual life.  This was full awakening. This wasn't "knowing" anything, because you only know something that is separate from you. This was being: the Ultimate - a fountain of Light, a dancing, ever-new source. Utter freedom, utter joy [...] Completely fulfilled, completely whole, no limits to my power and love and light."&lt;ref&gt;Andrea R. Jain, Muktananda: Entrepreneurial Godman, Tantric Hero, Chapter 9 of "Gurus of Modern Yoga," edited by Mark Singleton and Ellen Goldberg, Oxford University Press, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;}}

'''Muna''' or '''Wuna''' people are an indigenous group that inhabits the island of [[Muna Island|Muna]], [[Southeast Sulawesi]], [[Indonesia]]. From the physical appearance of the body, skull, skin color (dark brown), and hair (curly or wavy) it appears that the aboriginal Muna people are closer to the tribes of [[Polynesians]] and [[Melanesians]] in the Pacific and [[Australia]] compared to the [[Bugis|Buginese]] or [[Ethnic Malays|Malays]]. This is evident by the similarities of the people and their culture with of those in the [[East Nusa Tenggara]], and the islands of [[Timor]] and [[Flores]] generally.&lt;ref name="TLKDMMDSTPDK12"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lib.ui.ac.id/file?file=digital/20313917-T31285-Tradisi%20lisan.pdf |title=Tradisi Lisan Kagaa Dalam Masyarakat Muna Di Sulawesi Tenggara, Perubahan Dan Keberlanjutannya |author=Maulid |publisher=Universitas Indonesia |page=12 |date=2012 |accessdate=2018-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Woven [[sarong]] motifs found in [[East Nusa Tenggara]] and [[Muna Island]] share similar features such as horizontal lines with basic colors of yellow, green, red, and black.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://repository.ut.ac.id/6036/1/2012_191.pdf |title=Pengembangan Materi Ajar Bahasa Indonesia SD Kelas Tinggi Berbasis Budaya Sebagai Antisipasi Konflik Etnik Di Kota Kendari |author=La Ode; Muhammad Ruspan Takasi; Aris |publisher=Project Report. Universitas Terbuka, Kendari |date=2012 |accessdate=2018-09-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; The shape of their headwear also has a resemblance to each other. Since before until today, Muna fishermen often harvest sea cucumbers and go fishing up to the waters of [[Darwin, Northern Territory|Darwin]], [[Australia]] in the [[Timor Sea]]. This has caused Muna fishermen to have been arrested several times in these waters by the Australian government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.kkp.go.id/index.php/empat-nelayan-asal-muna-dipulangkan-dari-australia/ |title=Empat Nelayan Asal Muna Dipulangkan Dari Australia |publisher=KKP News |date=3 May 2016 |accessdate=2018-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; These habits may probably indicate the existence of a traditional relationship between the Muna people with [[Aboriginal Australians]].&lt;ref name="TLKDMMDSTPDK12"/&gt;

==Culture==
Traditional kite flying of the Muna people is called the ''Kaghati Kolope'' (Kolope leaf kite), as it is made from [[Dioscorea]] hispida leaf. It is thought that the ''kaghati kolope'' were used by the farmers as a means of entertainment while looking after their field. Apart from that, it is believed that the ''kaghati kolope'' will transform into an umbrella to protect its owner from the sun in the afterlife.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sport.detik.com/sport-lain/d-3316065/layang-layang-daun-kolope-dari-sulawesi-tenggara-berpeluang-catat-rekor-dunia |title=Layang-Layang Daun Kolope dari Sulawesi Tenggara Berpeluang Catat Rekor Dunia |author=Lucas Aditya |publisher=Detik |date=8 October 2016 |accessdate=2016-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Karia ceremony===
In Muna community, there is a circle of life ceremony for each individuals that begins from the ceremony of birth up to the ceremony of death. In order to perform the ceremony, the individual is required to go through each stages. One of the stages is the advancement of childhood to adulthood, especially for women, and the ceremony is called ''Karia'' and for the [[Butonese people]] it's called ''Pusuo''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Husein A. Chalik |author2=A. Djohan Mekuo |author3=Djuharta Meronda |title=Pakaian adat tradisional daerah Propinsi Sulawesi Tenggara|year=1992|publisher=Bagian Proyek Penelitian, Pengkajian dan Pembinaan Nilai-Nilai Budaya Sulawesi Tenggara|oclc=30092751}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Karia'' ceremony is a very important ceremony in the context of traditional customary throughout the life of the individual in Muna society. Karia ceremony is an initiation ritual performed for every woman to be secluded before entering adulthood and marriage.&lt;ref name="PAK20"&gt;{{cite book|author=Taman Mini Indonesia Indah|title=Paket acara khusus|year=1988|publisher=Taman Mini "Indonesia Indah"|oclc=21566740}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the understanding of the Muna society, that a woman should not be married if she has not undergone the process of ''Karia'' ceremony. If violated, the woman will feel excluded and will be ostracized within their own community.&lt;ref name="PAK20"/&gt;

===Kasambu tradition===
''Kasambu'' is a tradition passed down for generations held by the community of the Muna people in [[Southeast Sulawesi]], [[Indonesia]]. This tradition is a form of thanksgiving for the safety of the wife who will be giving birth to her child. This tradition is usually held before the birth of the child, usually in the 7th or 8th month. For the first seven months of the pregnancy, both husband and wife will bathe together.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcZ8r6tC3UE |title=ADAT 'KASAMBU ' (mandi 7 bulanan) SUKU MUNA |publisher=YouTube |accessdate=2015-01-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Kasambu'' procession begins with a couple of husband and wife feeding each other. Once fed, it has to be eaten once or finish; if unless the food is not finished, then the rest is given to the children that are present around them. Children that are participating is usually taken from close relatives. The act of feeding one another is then continued by the rest of the family members of the husband and wife. The expressed meaning of this procession came is to bring together both the families of the husband and wife. While the implied meaning of the procession acts as a vehicle to introduce the unborn child to the circle of family that the child will soon be raised into. The purpose of the ceremony is to bring well wishes and blessings for the unborn child as well as for the safety of both the mother and child in delivery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Asliah Zainal|title=Menjaga Adat, Menguatkan Agama Katoba dan Identitas Muslim Muna|year=2018|publisher=Deepublish|isbn=60-245-3981-9|page=50}}&lt;/ref&gt; The procession is ended with a prayer for good wishes by a person of religious position, priest or imam.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Proyek Penelitian dan Pencatatan Kebudayaan Daerah|title=Adat istiadat daerah Sulawesi Tenggara|year=1977|publisher=Departemen Pendidikan dan Kebudayaan, Pusat Penelitian Sejarah dan Budaya, Proyek Penelitian dan Pencatatan Kebudayaan Daerah|oclc=844545306}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Neuroscience of sex differences''' is the study of understanding the characteristics of the brain that separate the male brain and the female brain.  Psychological sex differences are thought by some to reflect the interaction of genes, hormones and social learning on brain development throughout the lifespan.

Some evidence from brain morphology and function studies indicates that male and female brains cannot always be assumed to be identical from either a structural or functional perspective, and some brain structures are [[sexual dimorphism|sexually dimorphic]].&lt;ref name="Cahill"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt;

__TOC__

==History==
Ideas of differences in the male and female brain circulated during the time of ancient Greek philosophers around 850 B.C. [[Aristotle]] claimed that males did not "receive their soul" until 40 days post-gestation and females did not until 80 days. In 1854, [[Emil Huschke]] discovered that "the [[frontal lobe]] in the male is all of 1%  larger than that of the female."&lt;ref name=Swaab&gt;{{Cite book |vauthors=Swaab DF, Hofman MA |title=Sexual differentiation of the human brain. A historical perspective |volume=61 |issue= |pages=361–74 |year=1984 |pmid=6396708 |doi=10.1016/S0079-6123(08)64447-7|series=Progress in Brain Research |isbn=9780444805324 |chapter=Sexual Differentiation of the Human Brain a Historical Perspective }}&lt;/ref&gt; As the 19th century progressed, scientists began researching sexual dimorphisms in the brain significantly more.&lt;ref name=Swaab2&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Hofman MA, Swaab DF |title=Sexual dimorphism of the human brain: myth and reality |journal=Experimental and Clinical Endocrinology |volume=98 |issue=2 |pages=161–70 |year=1991 |pmid=1778230 |doi=10.1055/s-0029-1211113|url=https://pure.knaw.nl/portal/files/490079/14938_285_swaab.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; Until around 21 years ago, scientists knew of several structural sexual dimorphisms of the brain, but they did not think that sex had any impact on how the human brain performs daily tasks. Through molecular, animal, and neuroimaging studies, a great deal of information regarding the differences between male and female brains and how much they differ in regards to both structure and function has been uncovered.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=McCarthy|first=Margaret M.|date=2016-02-19|title=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences: 371 (1688)|url=http://rstb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/371/1688|journal=Phil. Trans. R. Soc. B|series=Theme issue ‘Multifaceted origins of sex differences in the brain’|language=en|volume=371|issue=1688|pages=|issn=0962-8436|via=|doi=10.1098/rstb/371/1688}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Evolutionary explanations==

===Sexual selection===
Females show enhanced information recall compared to males. This may be due to the fact that females have a more intricate evaluation of risk-scenario contemplation, based on a prefrontal cortical control of the amygdala.  For example, the ability to recall information better than males most likely originated from sexual selective pressures on females during competition with other females in mate selection. Recognition of social cues was an advantageous characteristic because it ultimately maximized offspring and was therefore selected for during evolution.&lt;ref name="Cahill"/&gt;

[[Oxytocin]] is a hormone that induces contraction of the uterus and lactation in mammals. It is also a characteristic hormone of nursing mothers. Studies have found that oxytocin improves spatial memory. Through activation of the [[MAP kinase]] pathway, oxytocin plays a role in the enhancement of long-term synaptic plasticity, which is a change in strength between two neurons over a synapse that lasts for minutes or longer, and long-term memory. This hormone may have helped mothers remember the location of distant food sources so they could better nurture their offspring.&lt;ref name="Cahill"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Cahill L |title=Why sex matters for neuroscience |journal=Nature Reviews.

==Male vs. female brain anatomy==

===Hemisphere differences===
A popular theory regarding language functions suggests that women use both hemispheres more equally, whereas men are more strongly lateralized to the left hemisphere; however a 2008 meta-analysis of 29 studies comparing language lateralization in males and females found no overall difference.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Sommer IE, Aleman A, Somers M, Boks MP, Kahn RS |title=Sex differences in handedness, asymmetry of the planum temporale and functional language lateralization |journal=Brain Research |volume=1206 |issue= |pages=76–88 |date=April 2008  |pmid=18359009 |doi=10.1016/j.brainres.2008.01.003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Amygdala===
[[File:Amygdala small.gif|thumb|alt=image of Amygdala| The amygdala (red) in a human brain.]]
A 2016 meta-analysis found that the amygdala is not significantly larger in either sex.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Marwha|first=Dhruv|last2=Halari|first2=Meha|last3=Eliot|first3=Lise|date=2017-02-15|title=Meta-analysis reveals a lack of sexual dimorphism in human amygdala volume|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1053811916307431|journal=NeuroImage|volume=147|pages=282–294|doi=10.1016/j.neuroimage.2016.12.021|pmid=27956206}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2008 meta-analysis of [[fMRI]] studies of amygdala activation found larger effect sizes in men compared with women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Sergerie |first1=K |last2=Chochol |first2=C |last3=Armony |first3=JL |title=The role of the amygdala in emotional processing: a quantitative meta-analysis of functional neuroimaging studies. |journal=Neuroscience and Biobehavioral Reviews |date=2008 |volume=32 |issue=4 |pages=811–30 |doi=10.1016/j.neubiorev.2007.12.002 |pmid=18316124}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Amygdala volume correlates positively with fearfulness in girls but not in boys.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In fMRI studies, women display stronger activation in the amygdala and prefrontal cortex than men.&lt;ref name=Homberg2017/&gt;

===Hippocampus===
A 2016 meta-analysis found that the hippocampus does not differ in volume between men and women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Tan |first1=A |last2=Ma |first2=W |last3=Vira |first3=A |last4=Marwha |first4=D |last5=Eliot |first5=L |title=The human hippocampus is not sexually-dimorphic: Meta-analysis of structural MRI volumes. |journal=NeuroImage |date=1 January 2016 |volume=124 |issue=Pt A |pages=350–366 |doi=10.1016/j.neuroimage.2015.08.050 |pmid=26334947}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other regions and not region-specific===

There are sex differences in [[locus coeruleus]] dendritic structure that allow for an increased reception and processing of limbic information in females compared to males.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Kret |first1=ME |last2=De Gelder |first2=B |title=A review on sex differences in processing emotional signals. |journal=Neuropsychologia |date=June 2012 |volume=50 |issue=7 |pages=1211–21 |doi=10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2011.12.022 |pmid=22245006|url=http://dare.uva.nl/personal/pure/en/publications/a-review-on-sex-differences-in-processing-emotional-signals(3aea49a9-7521-4aae-863d-6f351a012b88).html }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aggressive and defiant behavior is also associated with decreased right [[anterior cingulate cortex]] (ACC) volume in boys.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===White/grey matter===
In a 2013 meta-analysis, researchers found on average males had larger [[grey matter]] (GM) volume in bilateral [[amygdala]]e, [[Hippocampus|hippocampi]], anterior [[Parahippocampal gyrus|parahippocampal gyri]], [[Cingulate cortex|posterior cingulate gyri]], [[precuneus]], [[putamen]] and [[Temporal lobe|temporal]] poles, areas in the left posterior and [[Anterior cingulate cortex|anterior cingulate gyri]], and areas in the [[cerebellum]] bilateral VIIb, VIIIa and Crus I lobes, left VI and right Crus II lobes.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = A meta-analysis of sex differences in human brain structure|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0149763413003011|journal = Neuroscience &amp; Biobehavioral Reviews|date = 2014-02-01|pmc = 3969295|pmid = 24374381|pages = 34–50|volume = 39|doi = 10.1016/j.neubiorev.2013.12.004|first = Amber N.

== Brain networks ==
A 2014 meta-analysis found that although men and women commonly used the same brain networks for [[working memory]], specific regions were sex specific.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://brainmap.org/pubs/Hill_BP_14.pdf|title = Gender differences in working memory networks: A BrainMap meta-analysis|last = Hill|first = Ashley C.|date = 2014|journal = Biological Psychology|doi = 10.1016/j.biopsycho.2014.06.008|pmid = 25042764|pmc = 4157091|access-date =|volume=102|pages=18–29}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, both men and women's active [[working memory]] networks composed of bilateral [[Brodmann area 46|middle frontal gyri]], left [[Cingulate cortex|cingulate gyrus]], right [[precuneus]], left [[Inferior parietal lobule|inferior]] and [[Parietal lobe|superior parietal lobes]], right [[claustrum]], and left middle [[Temporal lobe|temporal gyrus]] but women also tended have consistent activity in the [[Limbic system|limbic]] regions such as the [[Anterior cingulate cortex|anterior cingulate]], bilateral [[amygdala]] and right [[hippocampus]] while men tended to have a distributed networks spread out among the [[cerebellum]], portions of the superior [[parietal lobe]], the left [[Insular cortex|insula]] and bilateral [[thalamus]].&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

A 2017 review from the perspective of [[large-scale brain networks]], hypothesized that women's higher susceptibility to stress-prone diseases like PTSD and major depressive disorder, in which the [[salience network]] is theorized to be overactive and to interfere with the [[Executive functions|executive control network]], may be due in part (along with societal exposure to stressors and the coping strategies that are available to women) to underlying sex-based brain differences.&lt;ref name=Homberg2017&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Homberg |first1=Judith R |last2=Kozicz |first2=Tamas |last3=Fernández |first3=Guillén |title=Large-scale network balances in the transition from adaptive to maladaptive stress responses |journal=Current Opinion in Behavioral Sciences |date=April 2017 |volume=14 |pages=27–32 |doi=10.1016/j.cobeha.2016.11.003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Neurochemical differences==

===Hormones===
[[Steroid hormones]] have several effects on brain development as well as maintenance of [[homeostasis]] throughout adulthood. One effect they exhibit is on the [[hypothalamus]], where they increase [[synapse]] formation.&lt;ref name= "Simerly"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Simerly RB |title=Wired on hormones: endocrine regulation of hypothalamic development |journal=Current Opinion in Neurobiology |volume=15 |issue=1 |pages=81–5 |date=February 2005 |pmid=15721748 |doi=10.1016/j.conb.2005.01.013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Estrogen receptors have been found in the [[hypothalamus]], [[pituitary gland]], [[hippocampus]], and [[frontal cortex]], indicating the estrogen plays a role in brain development.  [[Gonadal hormone]] receptors have also been found in the basal fore-brain nuclei.&lt;ref name="Genazzani"/&gt;

====Estrogen and the female brain====
[[Estradiol]] influences cognitive function, specifically by enhancing learning and memory in a dose-sensitive manner.  Too much [[estrogen]] can have negative effects by weakening performance of learned tasks as well as hindering performance of memory tasks; this can result in females exhibiting poorer performance of such tasks when compared to males.&lt;ref name="Korol"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Korol DL |title=Role of estrogen in balancing contributions from multiple memory systems |journal=Neurobiology of Learning and Memory |volume=82 |issue=3 |pages=309–23 |date=November 2004  |pmid=15464412 |doi=10.1016/j.nlm.2004.07.006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been suggested that during development, estrogen can exhibit both feminizing and defeminizing effects on the human brain; high levels of estrogen induce male neural traits to develop while moderate levels induce female traits.  In females, defeminizing effects are resisted because of the presence of [[α-fetoprotein]] (AFP), a carrier protein proposed to transport estrogen into brain cells, allowing the female brain to properly develop. The role of AFP is significant at crucial stages of development, however. Prenatally, AFP blocks estrogen. Postnatally, AFP decreases to ineffective levels; therefore, it is probable that estrogen exhibits its effects on female brain development postnatally.&lt;ref name="Bakker"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Bakker J, Baum MJ |title=Role for estradiol in female-typical brain and behavioral sexual differentiation |journal=Frontiers in Neuroendocrinology |volume=29 |issue=1 |pages=1–16 |date=January 2008  |pmid=17720235 |pmc=2373265 |doi=10.1016/j.yfrne.2007.06.001|url=http://orbi.ulg.ac.be/handle/2268/91356 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ovariectomies, surgeries inducing [[menopause]], or natural menopause cause fluctuating and decreased [[estrogen]] levels in women. This in turn can "attenuate the effects" of endogenous opioid peptides. [[Opioid peptide]]s are known to play a role in emotion and motivation. [[β-endorphin]] (β-EP), an endogenous [[opioid peptide]], content has been found to decrease (in varying amounts/brain region), post [[ovariectomy]], in female rats within the [[hypothalamus]], [[hippocampus]], and [[pituitary gland]]. Such a change in β-EP levels could be the cause of mood swings, behavioral disturbances, and hot flashes in post menopausal women.&lt;ref name= "Genazzani"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Genazzani AR, Pluchino N, Luisi S, Luisi M |title=Estrogen, cognition and female ageing |journal=Human Reproduction Update |volume=13 |issue=2 |pages=175–87 |year=2007 |pmid=17135285 |doi=10.1093/humupd/dml042}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Testosterone and the male brain====
[[Testosterone]] heavily influences male development; a study found that perinatal females introduced to elevated testosterone levels exhibited male behavior patterns. In the absence of testosterone, female behavior is retained.&lt;ref name="Simerly"/&gt;
Testosterone's influence on the brain is caused by organizational developmental effects. It has been shown to influence proaptotic proteins so that they increase neuronal cell death in certain brain regions.  Another way testosterone affects brain development is by aiding in the construction of the "limbic hypothalamic neural networks".&lt;ref name="Simerly"/&gt;

==== Oxytocin and Vasopressin ====
[[Oxytocin]] is positively correlated with maternal behaviours, social recognition, social contact, sexual behaviour and  pair bonding. Oxytocin appears at higher levels in women than in men.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = https://younglab.yerkes.emory.edu/Getz/2007%20Carter%20BBR.pdf|title = Sex differences in oxytocin and vasopressin: Implications for autism spectrum disorders?|last = Carter|first = C.Sue|date = 2006|journal = Behavioural Brain Research |volume=176 |issue = 1|pages=170–186|doi = 10.1016/j.bbr.2006.08.025|pmid = 17000015|access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Vasopressin]] on the other hand is more present in men and mediates sexual behavior, aggression and other social functions.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Sexual dimorphism in cognition and behaviour: the role of X-linked genes|url = http://www.eje-online.org/content/155/suppl_1/S99|journal = European Journal of Endocrinology|date = 2006-11-01|issn = 0804-4643|pages = S99–S106|volume = 155|issue = suppl 1|doi = 10.1530/eje.1.02263|first = David H.|last = Skuse}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cognitive tasks==
It was once thought that sex differences in cognitive task and problem solving did not occur until puberty. However, as of 2000 evidence suggested that cognitive and skill differences are present earlier in development. For example, researchers have found that three- and four-year-old boys were better at targeting and at mentally rotating figures within a clock face than girls of the same age were. Prepubescent girls, however, excelled at recalling lists of words. These sex differences in cognition correspond to patterns of ability rather than overall intelligence.  Laboratory settings are used to systematically study the sexual dimorphism in problem solving task performed by adults.&lt;ref name= "Kimura"&gt;{{cite book|last=Kimura|first=Doreen|title=Sex and Cognition|date=July 31, 2000|publisher=A Bradford Book|isbn=978-0262611640|pages=28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On average, males excel relative to females at certain spatial tasks. Specifically, males have an advantage in tests that require the [[mental rotation]] or manipulation of an object.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Miller |first1=DI |last2=Halpern |first2=DF |title=The new science of cognitive sex differences. |journal=Trends in Cognitive Sciences |date=January 2014 |volume=18 |issue=1 |pages=37–45 |doi=10.1016/j.tics.2013.10.011 |pmid=24246136}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a computer simulation of a maze task, males completed the task faster and with fewer errors than their female counterparts. Additionally, males have displayed higher accuracy in tests of targeted motor skills, such as guiding projectiles.&lt;ref name="Kimura"/&gt; Males are also faster on reaction time and finger tapping tests.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Gender differences in processing speed: A review of recent research|journal = Learning and Individual Differences|pages = 145–149|volume = 21|issue = 2|doi = 10.1016/j.lindif.2010.11.021|first = Eka|last = Roivainen|year = 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On average, females excel relative to males on tests that measure recollection. They have an advantage on processing speed involving letters, digits and rapid naming tasks.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Females tend to have better object location memory and [[verbal memory]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Why women see differently from the way men see?

In maze and path completion tasks, males learn the goal route in fewer trials than females, but females remember more of the landmarks presented. This shows that females use landmarks in everyday situations to orient themselves more than males. Females are better at remembering whether objects had switched places or not.&lt;ref name="Kimura"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3718">The 1980s were the backdrop to a savage civil war which saw conflict destroy the nation of [[Nicaragua]], and the lives of 50,000+ civilians in the process. The multicultural country of Nicaragua experienced an excessive outpouring of citizens who fled the nation for their own security. Although many Nicaraguans live in [[Spain]], [[Mexico]] and [[Panama]], the majority of Nicaraguans living abroad are in [[Costa Rica]], the [[United States]] and [[El Salvador]]. [[Nicaragua]] has the second largest number in Central America (after [[El Salvador]]) of people living abroad, almost 1,200,000. 

According to the [[Pew Hispanic Center]], in 2007 there were 306,438 Nicaraguans in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.pewhispanic.org/2009/03/05/statistical-portrait-of-hispanics-in-the-united-states-2007/2007-portrait-of-hispanics-05/&lt;/ref&gt; That represents the fourth greatest Central American community in the U.S. Nicaraguans are the largest Central American Community in [[Florida]] (esp. in [[Miami-Dade County]]) and the third largest in [[California]] (i.e. [[San Francisco]] and [[Los Angeles]]).

According to the 2000 Census, there were 226,374 Nicaraguans in Costa Rica. However, this number is believed to be higher because there were thousands of undocumented immigrants at that time. Probably there are at least 500,000 Nicaraguans in Costa Rica, including illegals. In [[El Salvador]] almost 200,000 Nicaraguans live in the country to find available work, another 200,000 Nicaraguans live in [[Guatemala]] and 100,000 are believed to live in [[Honduras]]. {{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}

An effort is being made by the [http://www.diasporanica.com/ Academia de Genealogia de la Diaspora Nicaraguense] by collecting and publishing all the family relations of Nicaraguans living abroad and their connections to their roots in the country.

Nicaraguans living abroad are also found in smaller numbers in [[Europe]] including the countries of [[France]], [[Germany]], [[Italy]], [[Norway]], [[Sweden]] and the [[UK]]; [[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]]; [[Canada]], [[Brazil]] and [[Argentina]]; and [[Japan]]. Usually the Nicaraguans arrived in those countries fleeing from [[political repression|political oppression]] and economic conditions.

It's difficult to estimate the number of Nicaraguans living abroad because a substantial amount are living in host countries illegally. The table shows current statistics for certain countries:

The '''Odunde Festival''' is a one-day festival and mostly a [[street market]] catered to African-American interests and the [[African diaspora]]. It is derived from the tradition of the [[Yoruba people]] of [[Nigeria]] in celebration of the new year.  It is centered at the intersection of Grays Ferry Avenue and South Street in the U.S. city of [[Philadelphia]], [[Pennsylvania]].

==History==
The Odunde festival started in Philadelphia in 1975.

They are also known as '''Adi Dravida''' ("Ancient Dravidians"), which was a title encouraged by the [[British Raj]] as a substitute for ''Paraiyar'' because the British believed that their colonising of the country had ended slavery in India.{{sfnp|Irschick|1994|pp=168-169}}

The [[2001 Census of India]] reported that in Tamil Nadu the Adi Dravida population was 5,402,755 and the Paraiyar population was 1,860,519, giving a total of 7,263,274. The combined total was 11.63 percent of the state's population.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.censusindia.gov.in/Tables_Published/SCST/dh_sc_tamilnadu.pdf |title=Tamil Nadu&amp;nbsp;— Data Highlightst: The Scheduled Castes&amp;nbsp;— Census of India 2001 |page=1 |accessdate=2012-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are numerically the largest [[Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes|Scheduled Caste]] in Tamil Nadu, accounting for about 59 per cent of the total.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.censusindia.gov.in/Tables_Published/SCST/dh_sc_tamilnadu.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Etymology ==
[[Robert Caldwell]] and several other writers derive the name of the community from the [[Tamil language|Tamil]] word ''[[parai]]'' ("drum"). According to this hypothesis, the Paraiyars were originally a community of drummers who performed during flood time, war, auspicious events like festivals, weddings and also funerals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thehindu.com/features/friday-review/music/secular-and-sacred/article4268995.ece|title=Secular and sacred|first=Suganthy|last=Krishnamachari|date=3 January 2013|publisher=|accessdate=11 April 2018|via=www.thehindu.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; As their population increased, they were forced to take up occupations that were considered unclean, such as burial of corpses and [[manual scavenging|scavenging]]. Because of this, they came to be considered as an untouchable caste.  M. Srinivasa Aiyangar finds this etymology unsatisfactory, arguing that beating of drums could not have been an occupation of a large number of people. Some other writers, such as [[Gustav Solomon Oppert]], derive the name from ''poraian'', the name of a regional subdivision mentioned by ancient Tamil grammarians.{{sfnp|Basu|2011|pp=2-3}}

== History ==
=== Pre-British period ===
The [[Sangam literature]] ({{circa}} 300 BCE–300 CE) contains references to the caste system of Tamil culture, which contained certain "low-born" groups referred to as ''Pulaiyar''. They were believed to be associated with magical power and kept at a distance, made to live in separate hamlets outside villages. However, their magical power was believed to sustain the king, who had the ability to transform it into auspicious power. Thus the ''pulaiyar'' performed a ritual function by composing and singing songs in the king's favour and beating drums. They were divided into subgroups based on the instruments they played. [[George L. Hart]] believes that one of the drums called ''kiṇai'' later came to be called ''paṟai'' and the people that played the drum were ''paṟaiyar'' (plural of ''paṟaiyan'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Hart |first=George L. |authorlink=George L. Hart |chapter=Early Evidence for Caste in South India |editor-last=Hockings |editor-first=Paul |title=Dimensions of Social Life: Essays in honor of David B. Mandelbaum |location=Berlin |publisher=Mouton de Gruyter |year=1987 |page=468 |isbn=978-3-11084-685-0 |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=ERQp5YCXiWsC&amp;pg=PA468 |quote="The ''kiṇaiyan'' seems to have been a bit lower than the ''Pāṇan''. He would beat a small drum called a ''kiṇai'', praise the king in the morning or at other times, receiving some reward for that act, and, evidently, he would go from village to village announcing the king’s decrees. He was probably the same as the modern ''Paṟaiyan''.}}
&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfnp|Moffatt|1979|pp=36-37}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Origins of Yoga and Tantra: Indic Religions to the Thirteenth Century |first=Geoffrey |last=Samuel |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=2008 |isbn=978-1-13947-021-6 |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=JAvrTGrbpf4C |page=83}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest extant reference to the term Paraiyar (as an occupational term for drummers) occurs in a poem by the Sangam poet Mangudi Kilar (2nd century CE). But the earliest mention of the term as a caste does not occur until the reign of [[Rajaraja Chola]] (11th century CE).{{sfnp|Basu|2011|p=3}} From this period onwards, the word occurs in different contexts in the various pre-British sources:
* Inscriptions, especially those from the [[Thanjavur district]], mention ''paraicceri''s, which were separate hamlets of the Paraiyars.{{sfnp|Orr|2000|pp=236-237}} Also living in separate hamlets were the artisans such as goldsmiths and cobblers, who were also accorded low status in the Sangam literature.{{sfnp|Moffatt|1979|p=38}}
* In a few inscriptions (all of them from outside Thanjavur district), Paraiyars are described as temple patrons.{{sfnp|Orr|2000|pp=236-237}}
* There are also references to "Paraiya chieftainships" in the 8th and 10th centuries, but it is not known what these were and how they were integrated into the Chola political system.{{sfnp|Moffatt|1979|p=38}}
* According to the [[Later Cholas|Later Chola]] inscriptions, someone who breaks the terms of an endowment is to be considered as degraded as a man who gives his wife to a Paraiyar.{{sfnp|Orr|2000|pp=236-237}}

[[Burton Stein]] describes an essentially continuous process of expansion of the nuclear areas of the caste society into forest and upland areas of tribal and warrior people, and their integration into the caste society at the lowest levels. Many of the forest groups were incorporated as Paraiyar either by association with the parai drum or by integration into the low-status labouring groups who were generically called Paraiyar. Thus, it is thought that Paraiyar came to have many subcastes.{{sfnp|Moffatt|1979|p=41}}

During the [[Bhakti movement]] ({{circa}} 7th–9th centuries CE), the saints - [[Shaivism|Shaivite]] [[Nayanars]] and the [[Vaishnavism|Vaishnavite]] [[Alvars]] - contained one saint each from the untouchable communities. The Nayanar saint [[Nandanar]] was born, according to ''[[Periya Puranam]]'', in a "threshold of the huts covered with strips of leather", with mango trees from whose branches were hung drums. "In this abode of the people of the lowest caste (''kadainar''), there arose a man with a feeling of true devotion to the feet of [[Shiva|Siva]]." Nandanar was described as a temple servant and leather worker, who supplied straps for drums and gut-string for stringed instruments used in the [[Chidambaram]] temple, but he was himself not allowed to enter the temple.{{sfnp|Moffatt|1979|pp=38-39}} The Paraiyar regard Nandanar as one of their own caste.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Vincentnathan |first=Lynn |title=Nandanar: Untouchable Saint and Caste Hindu Anomaly |journal=Ethos |volume=21 |number=2 |date=June 1993 |pages=154–179 |JSTOR=640372 |subscription=yes |doi=10.1525/eth.1993.21.2.02a00020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Scholars such as Burchett and Moffatt state that the Bhakti devotationalism did not undermine Brahmin ritual dominance. Instead, it might have strengthened it by warding off challenges from [[Jainism]] and [[Buddhism]].{{sfnp|Moffatt|1979|p=39}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Patton |last=Burchett  |journal=International Journal of Hindu Studies |date=August 2009 |title=Bhakti Rhetoric in the Hagiography of ‘Untouchable’ Saints: Discerning Bhakti’s Ambivalence on Caste and Brahminhood |JSTOR=40608021 |subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== British colonial era ===
By the early 19th century, the Paraiyars had a degraded status in the Tamil society.{{sfnp|Basu|2011|p=16}} [[Francis Buchanan-Hamilton|Francis Buchanan]]'s report on socio-economic condition of South Indians described them ("Pariar") as inferior caste slaves, who cultivated the lands held by [[Brahmin]]s. This report largely shaped the perceptions of the British officials about the contemporary society. They regarded Pariyars as an outcaste, untouchable community.{{sfnp|Basu|2011|pp=2}} In the second half of the 19th century, there were frequent descriptions of the Paraiyars in official documents and reformist tracts as being "disinherited sons of the earth".{{sfnp|Irschick|1994|pp=153–190}}{{sfnp|Bergunder|2004|p=68}} The first reference to the idea may be that written by [[Francis Whyte Ellis]] in 1818, where he writes that the Paraiyars "affect to consider themselves as the real proprietors of the soil". In 1894, William Goudie, a [[Wesleyanism|Weslyan]] missionary, said that the Paraiyars were self-evidently the "disinherited children of the soil".{{sfnp|Bergunder|2004|p=68}} English officials such as Ellis believed that the Paraiyars were [[serf]]s toiling under a system of bonded labour that resembled the European [[villeinage]].{{sfnp|Basu|2011|pp=9-11}} However, scholars such as Burton Stein argue that the agricultural bondage in the Tamil society was different from the contemporary British ideas of [[slavery]].{{sfnp|Basu|2011|pp=4}}

Historians such as David Washbrook have argued that the socio-economic status of the Paraiyars rose greatly in the 18th century during the [[Company rule in India]]; Washbrook calls it the "Golden Age of the Pariah".{{sfnp|Basu|2011|pp=33-34}} Raj Sekhar Basu disagrees with this narrative, although he agrees that there were "certain important economic developments".{{sfnp|Basu|2011|p=39}}

The [[Church Mission Society]] converted a large number of Paraiyars to Christianity by the early 19th century.{{sfnp|Kanjamala|2014|p=127}} During the British Raj, the missionary schools and colleges admitted Paraiyar students amid opposition from the upper-caste students. In 1893, the colonial government sanctioned an additional stipend for the Paraiyar students.{{sfnp|Kanjamala|2014|p=66}} The colonial officials, scholars and missionaries attempted to rewrite the history of the Paraiyars, characterising them as a community that enjoyed a high status in the past. [[Edgar Thurston]] (1855-1935), for example, claimed that their status was nearly equal to that of the Brahmins in the past.{{sfnp|Basu|2011|pp=24-26}} H. A. Stuart, in his Census Report of 1891, claimed that [[Valluvar|Valluvans]] were a priestly class among the Paraiyars, and served as priests during [[Pallava dynasty|Pallava]] reign. Robert Caldwell, [[J. H. A. Tremenheere]] and Edward Jewitt Robinson claimed that the ancient poet-philosopher [[Thiruvalluvar]] was a Paraiyar.{{sfnp|Moffatt|1979|p=19-21}}

=== Buddhist advocacy by Iyothee Thass ===
[[Iyothee Thass]], a [[Siddha medicine|Siddha doctor]] by occupation, belonged to a Paraiyar elite. In 1892, he demanded access for Paraiyars to Hindu temples, but faced resistance from upper-caste [[Brahmin]]s and [[Vellalar]]s. This experience led him to believe that it was impossible to emancipate the community within the Hindu fold. In 1893, he also rejected [[Christianity]] and [[Islam]] as the alternatives to Hinduism, because caste differences had [[Caste system among Indian Christians|persisted among Indian Christians]], while the backwardness of contemporary local Muslims made Islam unappealing.{{sfnp|Bergunder|2004|p=70}}

Thass subsequently attempted a Buddhist reconstruction of the Tamil religious history. He argued that the Paraiyars were originally followers of [[Buddhism in India|Buddhism]] and constituted the original population of India. According to him, the Brahmanical invaders from [[Persia]] defeated them and destroyed Buddhism in southern India; as a result, the Paraiyars lost their culture, religion, wealth and status in the society and become destitute. In 1898, Thass and a large number of his followers converted to Buddhism and founded the Sakya Buddha Society (''cākkaiya putta caṅkam'') with the influential mediation of [[Henry Steel Olcott]] of the [[Theosophical Society]]. Olcott subsequently and greatly supported the Tamil Paraiyar Buddhists.{{sfnp|Bergunder|2004|pp=67-71}}

=== Controversy over the community's name ===
Iyothee Thass felt that ''Paraiyar'' was a [[pejorative|slur]], and campaigned against its usage. During the 1881 [[Census of India prior to independence|census of India]], he requested the government to record the community members under the name ''Aboriginal Tamils''. He later suggested ''Dravidian'' as an alternative term, and formed the Dhraavidar Mahajana Sabhai (Dravidian [[Mahajana]] Assembly) in 1891. Another Paraiyar leader, [[Rettamalai Srinivasan]], however, advocated using the term ''Paraiyar'' with pride. In 1892, he formed the Parayar Mahajana Sabha (Paraiyar Mahajana Assembly), and also started a news publication titled ''Paraiyan''.{{sfnp|Srikumar|2014|p=357}}

Thass continued his campaign against the term, and petitioned the government to discontinue its usage, demanding punishment for those who used the term. He incorrectly claimed that the term ''Paraiyar'' was not found in any ancient records (it has been, in fact, found in the 10th century [[Chola dynasty|Chola]] stone inscriptions from [[Kolar district]]).{{sfnp|Srikumar|2014|p=357}} Thass subsequently advocated the term ''[[Adi Dravida]]'' (''Original Dravidians'') to describe the community. In 1892, he used the term ''Adidravida Jana Sabhai'' to describe an organisation, which was probably Srinivasan's Parayar Mahajana Sabha. In 1895, he established the People’s Assembly of Urdravidians (Adidravida Jana Sabha), which probably split off from Srinivasan's organisation. According to Michael Bergunder, Thass was thus the first person to introduce the concept of ''Adi Dravida'' into political discussion.{{sfnp|Bergunder|2004|p=69}}

Another Paraiyar leader, M. C. Rajah&amp;nbsp;— a [[Madras Presidency|Madras]] councillor&amp;nbsp;— made successful efforts for adoption of the term ''Adi-Dravidar'' in the government records.{{sfnp|Srikumar|2014|p=357}} In 1914, the [[Madras Legislative Council]] passed a resolution that officially censured the usage of the term ''Paraiyar'' to refer to a specific community, and recommended ''Adi Dravidar'' as an alternative.{{sfnp|Bergunder|Frese|Schröder|2011|p=260}} In the 1920s and 1930s, [[Periyar E. V. Ramasamy]] ensured the wider dissemination of the term ''Adi Dravida''.{{sfnp|Bergunder|2004|p=69}}

== Right-hand caste faction ==
Paraiyars belong to the ''[[Valangai]]'' ("Right-hand caste faction"). Some of them assume the title ''Valangamattan'' ("people of the right-hand division"). The ''Valangai''  comprised castes with an agricultural basis while the ''[[Idangai]]'' consisted of castes involved in manufacturing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.cmi.ac.in/gift/Epigraphy/epig_tambarammore.htm|title=More inscriptions from the Tambaram area |accessdate=21 September 2008|publisher=Madras Christian College Magazine|first=Gift |last=Siromoney|journal=Madras Christian College Magazine |volume=44 |year=1975}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Valangai'', which was better organised politically.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Caste Ideology and Interaction |volume=9 |series=Cambridge Papers in Social Anthropology |editor-first=Dennis B. |editor-last=McGilvray |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=1982 |isbn=978-0-52124-145-8 |page=105 |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=n-88AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA105 |first=Stephen C. |last=Levinson |chapter=Caste rank and verbal interaction in western Tamilnadu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term is mostly associated with the championships of [[Olympiacos F.C.]] during the years 1997-2003 and its then president [[Sokratis Kokkalis]], but has also spread to refer to the general corruption in the Greek football.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.kathimerini.gr/4dcgi/_w_articles_politics_2_07/04/2002_21171|title=O "θείος", ο "κοκκαλιάρης" και ο "περίεργος" - ΠΟΛΙΤΙΚΗ - Η ΚΑΘΗΜΕΡΙΝΗ|publisher=|accessdate=16 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the public opinion, the lure has always been the annual financial bonus from [[UEFA]] for the participating teams in the [[UEFA Champions League]].

With the method of [[telephone tapping]], [[Makis Triantafyllopoulos]], a TV journalist, trapped a conversation between [[Thomas Mitropoulos]] (invisible owner of [[Egaleo F.C.]] and at the same time "advisor of Olympiakos on arbitration matters") and a referee (Spathas), saying ''"...we don't care about the others, we only want Olympiakos win, only Olympiakos and Egaleo, fuck all others..."'' and referring to Kokkalis as ''the Uncle''. The journalist involved also the president then of the [[Hellenic Football Federation]], [[Vassilis Gagatsis]].

==="Koriopolis"===

After the taking of Olympiakos' leadership by [[Evangelos Marinakis]], new scandals came in the light, such as the [[Koriopolis]] scandal. In one of the recorded conversations, [[Olympiacos Volou 1937 F.C.|Olympiacos Volou]]' chairman [[Achilleas Beos]] asks protection for the referees (Kalopoulos, Tryfonas) from [[Evangelos Marinakis]], after a controversial winning game of Olympiakos against Panathinaikos on 21 February 2011. In February 2012, the [[Superleague Greece]] with the agreement of the [[Hellenic Football Federation]] achieved the replacement of the two football prosecutors (Fakos, Antonakakis) with two others (Petropoulos, Karras). The investigation had no progress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sdna.gr/gr/podosfairo/dikastikes-upotheseis-skandala/arthro/25841/eisaggeleas-gia-tous-eisaggeleis-uparhei/|title=SPORTSDNA - ΠΟΔΟΣΦΑΙΡΟ - Δικαστικές Υποθέσεις - Εισαγγελέας για τους εισαγγελείς υπάρχει;|publisher=|accessdate=16 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reactions and judicial process==
In 1999, after a derby match between [[Olympiacos F.C.]] and [[A.E.K. Athens F.C.]], [[Demis Nikolaidis]] and other AEK players decided to abstain from the [[Greece national football team]] as a protest for the arbitration. They revoked in 2001 after the coming of [[Otto Rehhagel]] as manager.

In 2004, the ex-manager of Egaleo FC, [[Stéphane Demol]], stated that the reason he was sacked from the team was because he didn't agree with the president on match-fixing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sport24.gr/football/omades/Aigaleo/h_ptwsh_toy_aigalew.3170061.html|title=H πτώση του Αιγάλεω|author=Δημήτρης Σαμόλης|date=2 December 2014|publisher=|accessdate=16 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, referee Dimitris Pontikis stated that indeed there was among the referees a group that favoured [[Olympiacos F.C.]], in exchange for a better career.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.contra.gr/Soccer/Hellas/article1022964.ece|title=Ο Ποντίκης μιλάει για παράγκα , Γκαγκάτση και Μητρόπουλο|date=26 October 2008|work=Contra.gr|accessdate=16 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 21 February 2011, after a controversial [[Derby of the eternal enemies|derby]] match between [[Olympiacos F.C.|Olympiakos]] and [[Panathinaikos F.C.]] (referee Kalopoulos), Panathinaikos striker [[Djibril Cissé]] had an wrangle with [[Evangelos Marinakis]] and stated he would abandon [[Superleague Greece]] because of the arbitration.

With the break out of the [[Koriopolis]] scandal, appeals to the [[Judicial system of Greece|Greek Justice]] were made by some politicians, such as the ministers Yiannis Kourakis and Giorgos Floridis, who stated that "a gang controls the referees from the background". In 2011, minister [[Pavlos Geroulanos]] called the Greek football "totally corrupted".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.setimes.com/cocoon/setimes/xhtml/en_GB/features/setimes/articles/2011/11/21/reportage-01 Greek football turns ugly (SETimes.com)&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The whole judicial process had no result.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ethnos.gr/ethnosport/article.asp?catid=8356&amp;pubid=118084683&amp;subid=2|title=Η "παράγκα" άντεξε τον σεισμό των αποκαλύψεων|author=e-go.gr , Pegasus Interactive|publisher=|accessdate=16 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time, [[UEFA]] officials said no action was presently being considered against Olympiakos regarding its participation in the [[UEFA Champions League|Champions League]] of the following season.

==="Criminal Organization"===
{{main|2015 Greek football scandal}}
In August 2014, new elements came in the light by the [[National Intelligence Service (Greece)|National Intelligence Service]] involving Marinakis, Giorgos Sarris (president of the [[Hellenic Football Federation]]) and other football officers, referees and judges in the establishment of a "criminal organisation".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitaljournal.com/news/politics/op-ed-greek-officials-still-playing-dirty/article/404010|title=Op-Ed: Greek officials still playing dirty|publisher=|accessdate=16 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/dec/04/sixteen-charged-greek-football-match-fixing-investigation|title=Sixteen reportedly charged in Greek football match-fixing investigation|work=the Guardian|accessdate=16 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, Marinakis is appearing to be behind the attack to the bakery shop of Konstantineas and behind attacks to referees (Giorgos Daloukas, Dimitris Kyrkos etc.), journalists and others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sdna.gr/gr/egklimatiki-organosi/article/28483/ta-kauta-suberasmata-tou-porismatos-korea/|title=SPORTSDNA - ΕΓΚΛΗΜΑΤΙΚΗ ΟΡΓΑΝΩΣΗ - Τα "καυτά" συμπεράσματα του πορίσματος Κορέα!|publisher=|accessdate=16 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.insideworldfootball.com/world-football/europe/16904-greek-corruption-olympiacos-owner-charged-in-match-fixing-ring-round-up|title=Greek corruption: Olympiacos owner charged in match-fixing ring round-up - Inside World Football|author=Paul Nicholson|publisher=|accessdate=16 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.insideworldfootball.com/matt-scott/16944-matt-scott-greek-football-s-tragedy-is-a-lesson-for-us-all|title=Matt Scott: Greek football's tragedy is a lesson for us all - Inside World Football|author=Paul Nicholson|publisher=|accessdate=16 August 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924035231/http://www.insideworldfootball.com/matt-scott/16944-matt-scott-greek-football-s-tragedy-is-a-lesson-for-us-all|archivedate=24 September 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2014, [[Olivier Kapo]], ex-player of [[Levadiakos F.C.]], stated in French media that "in Greek football everything is corrupted, mafia-controlled, while [[FIFA]] and [[UEFA]] simply don't care".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sofoot.com/olivier-kapo-en-grece-c-est-la-mafia-totale-188629.html En Grèce, c'est la mafia totale!&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2014, the Chief Refereeing Officer [[Hugh Dallas]] criticized the arbitration of [[Ilias Spathas]], after a match of Olympiacos, as the "worst he has ever seen" saying that the mistakes were not normal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sport24.gr/football/ellada/SuperLeague/ta-epsale-o-ntalas-se-spatha-kai-kontiza.3144652.html|title=Τα έψαλε ο Ντάλας σε Σπάθα και Κοντιζά|date=16 November 2014|publisher=|accessdate=16 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gazzetta.gr/football/article/671010/ntalas-se-spatha-den-mporo-na-pistepso-oti-einai-apla-lathi|title=Ντάλας σε Σπάθα: "Δεν μπορώ να πιστέψω ότι είναι απλά λάθη"|author=Gazzetta team|date=16 November 2014|publisher=|accessdate=16 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; A few days later he quit from being responsible for the appointments of refereeing officials for Super League and Football League matches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://footballrefereeing.blogspot.gr/2014/11/weekly-news-hugh-dallas-quits-as-greek.html#.VJf9Fc6AA|title=Weekly News: Hugh Dallas quits as Greek Referee Officer following Attacks on colleague - The 3rd Team|publisher=|accessdate=16 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2015, ex-owner of [[Fostiras F.C.]], [[Carlo Vandekerkhof]], stated: "the situation in Greece is a shame, the second division is a catastrophy...I was approached also to fix a match...seems to be in their culture".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gazzetta.gr/football/article/763569/i-ellada-einai-mia-ntropi|title=Η Ελλάδα είναι μια ντροπή|author=Αχιλλέας Τσιμπογιάννης|date=24 June 2015|publisher=|accessdate=16 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Resource mobilization''' is the process of getting resources from resource provider, using different mechanisms, to implement an organization's pre-determined goals.&lt;ref name="What is Resource Mobilization"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Seltzer|first1=Judith B.|title=What is Resource Mobilization|url=https://healthcommcapacity.org/resource-mobilization-important/|website=Health Communication Capacity Collaborative|publisher=Management Sciences for Health|accessdate=20 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It deals in acquiring the needed resources in a timely, cost-effective manner. Resource mobilization advocates having the right type of resource, at the right time, at right price with making right use of acquired resources thus ensuring optimum utilization of the same.

It is a major [[sociological theory]] in the study of [[social movement]]s which emerged in the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Frontiers in Social Movement Theory|last=Morris|first=Aldon D.|publisher=Yale University Press|year=1992|isbn=978-0300054866|location=|pages=3|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It emphasizes the ability of a movement's members to 1) acquire resources and to 2) [[mobilization|mobilize]] people towards accomplishing the movement's goals.&lt;ref name="Kendall"&gt;Kendall 2006&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast to the traditional [[collective behaviour]] theory that views social movements as [[deviant]] and irrational, resource mobilization sees them as rational [[social institution]]s, created and populated by [[social actors]] with a goal of taking [[political action]].&lt;ref name="Buechler"&gt;Buechler 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theory==
According to resource mobilization theory, a core, professional group in a [[social movement organization]] works towards bringing money, supporters, attention of the media, alliances with those in power, and refining the organizational structure. The theory revolves around the central notion of how messages of social change are spread from person to person and group to group. The conditions needed for a social movement are the notion that grievances shared by multiple individuals and organizations, ideologies about social causes and how to go about reducing those grievances.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=McCarthy and Zald|year=1977|title=Resource Mobilization and Social Movements: A Partial Theory|url=http://www.coss.ethz.ch/content/dam/ethz/special-interest/gess/computational-social-science-dam/documents/education/Fall2009/simulation/mccarthyzald77.pdf|journal=The American Journal of Sociology|volume=82|issue=6|pages=1212–1241|doi=10.1086/226464}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This theory assumes that individuals are [[Rational choice theory|rational]]: individuals weigh the costs and benefits of movement participation and act only if benefits outweigh costs. When movement goals take the form of [[public good]]s, the [[free rider dilemma]] has to be taken into consideration.&lt;ref name=Kendall/&gt;

Social movements are [[goal-oriented]], but organization is more important than resources. Organization means the interactions and relations between [[social movement organization]]s (SMOs) and other organizations (other SMOs, businesses, governments, etc.). Efficiency of the organization [[infrastructure]] is a key resource in itself.&lt;ref name=Kendall/&gt;

Resource mobilization theory can be divided into two camps:
* [[John D. McCarthy (Sociologist)|John D. McCarthy]] and [[Mayer Zald]] are the originators and major advocates of the classic entrepreneurial (economic) version of this theory, while
* [[Charles Tilly]] and [[Doug McAdam]] are proponents of the political version of resource mobilization called [[Political opportunity|political process theory]].&lt;ref name=Kendall/&gt;

The entrepreneurial model explains [[collective action]] as a result of [[economics]] factors and [[organization theory]]. It argues that grievances are not sufficient to explain creation of social movements. Instead access to and control over resources is the crucial factor. The laws of [[supply and demand]] explain the flow of resources to and from the movements, and that individual actions (or lack thereof) is accounted for by [[rational choice theory]].&lt;ref name=Kendall/&gt;

The political model focuses on the [[political struggle]] instead of economic factors.&lt;ref name=Kendall/&gt;

In the 1980s, other theories of social movements such as [[social constructionism]] and [[new social movement theory]] challenged the resource mobilization framework.&lt;ref name=Buechler/&gt;

== Types of resources ==
Edwards and McCarthy identified five types of resources available to [[social movement organizations]]&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Blackwell Companion to Social Movements|last=Edwards and McCarthy|publisher=Blackwell Publishing|year=2004|isbn=978-0-631-22669-7|location=Massachusetts|pages=116–152}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Moral: Resources available to the SMO such as solidarity support, legitimacy and sympathetic support. These resources can be easily retracted, making them less accessible than other resources.
* Cultural: Knowledge that likely has become widely, though not necessarily universally, known. Examples include how to accomplish specific tasks like enacting a protest event, holding a news conference, running a meeting, forming an organization, initiating a festival, or surfing the web
* Social-Organizational: Resources that deal with spreading the message. They include intentional social organization, which is created to spread the movement's message, and appropriable social organization, which is created for reasons other than moving for social change. Examples include spreading flyers, holding community meetings and recruiting volunteers.
* Material: Includes financial and physical capital, like office space, money, equipment and supplies.
* Human: Resources such as labor, experience, skills and expertise in a certain field. More tangible than some of the others (moral, cultural and social-organizational) and easier to quantify.

==Criticism==
Critics point out that resource mobilization theory fails to explain [[social movement communities]], which are large networks of individuals and other groups surrounding social movement organizations, and providing them with various services. Critics also argue that it fails to explain how groups with limited resources can succeed in bringing social change and that it does not assign sufficient weight to grievances, identity, and culture as well as many [[macrosociology|macro-sociological]] issues.&lt;ref name=Kendall/&gt;

== Examples ==
=== Civil Rights Movement ===
{{Main|Civil Rights Movement}}
[[Aldon Morris]] claims that the resource mobilization theory is a possible explanation of the surge of the [[civil rights movement]] in the United States. The rise of this movements was not because African Americans felt at the same time a frustration which lead to a rebellion, Instead, it was the mobilization and organization of the African American leaders the trigger of the civil rights movement.&lt;ref name="Deric"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Political sociology : oppression, resistance, and the state|last=Deric.|first=Shannon|date=2011-01-01|publisher=Pine Forge Press|isbn=9781412980401|oclc=746832550}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the leaders Aldon Morris reframed are [[Rosa Parks]] and [[Martin Luther King Jr.|Marthin Luther King Jr.]] who combined with the efforts of the [[National Association for the Advancement of Colored People|NAACP]], the [[Southern Christian Leadership Conference|SCLC]], the [[Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee|SNCC]], [[Congress of Racial Equality|CORE]] as well as small business, labor unions, students' organizations and faith communities lead to the civil rights movement. These organizations together mobilized vast resources instead of doing it individually leading to massive mobilization of people fighting for the same objective.&lt;ref name="Deric"/&gt; The research done by Aldon Morris demonstrates that social movements depend on the ability of empower the less powerful people; "the civil rights movement managed, against overwhelming odds and historical tradition, to push for reform of oppressive and rigidly racist cultural repertoires, practices and laws that had denied African Americans basic civil rights".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Political sociology : oppression, resistance, and the state|last=Deric.|first=Shannon|date=2011-01-01|publisher=Pine Forge Press|isbn=9781412980401|location=|pages=|oclc=746832550}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== MoveOn.org ===
[[MoveOn.org]] is a social movement organization to which resource mobilization theory can apply because it is a platform for people to either sign a petition or start a new petition.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://front.moveon.org/|title=MoveOn.Org {{!}} Democracy In Action|website=MoveOn.Org {{!}} Democracy In Action|language=en-US|access-date=2016-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Coupled with [[Political opportunity|political process theory]], a social movement theory which posits that social movements either succeed or fail due to [[political opportunity|political opportunities]], MoveOn.org has been a successful tool because of its accessibility, which would make people more likely to start a petition and move toward a common goal. In other words, resource mobilization applies to MoveOn.org because 1) the website itself is an existing resource that is accessible to consumers of the Internet which helps mobilize the goals of the organization and 2) that mobilization is essential to MoveOn.org's success.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://healthcommcapacity.org/resource-mobilization-important/|title=What is Resource Mobilization and Why is it so Important? – Health Communication Capacity Collaborative – Social and Behavior Change Communication|date=2014-10-20|website=Health Communication Capacity Collaborative – Social and Behavior Change Communication|language=en-US|access-date=2016-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, resource mobilization applies because of the fact that the people who founded the organization knew how to utilize the resources available, which implies that anyone who uses the website to sign a petition or start a petition are rational social actors who act as utility maximizers, who weigh the costs and benefits before deciding to be a part of a social movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/utility-maximization.html|title=What is utility maximization? definition and meaning|website=BusinessDictionary.com|access-date=2016-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Arab Spring ===
The [[Arab Spring]] is another example. Born in [[Tunisia]] in December 2010, growing unrest spread through [[Egypt]], [[Syria]], and [[Yemen]]. Researchers studying resource mobilization through the [[Egyptian revolution of 2011|Egyptian Revolution]] during the Arab Spring found a reliance on social media to spread social action messages while the governments worked to censor the media and cut off those countries from the rest of the world by [[Internet censorship in the Arab Spring|severing the internet]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Eltantawy and Wiest|year=2011|title=The Arab Spring: Social media in the Egyptian revolution and reconsidering resource mobilization theory.|url=|journal=International Journal of Communication|volume=5|pages=1207–1224|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The activists in those countries were communicating with each other through social media platforms like [[Twitter]] to coordinate protests, keep tabs on each other and spread the social change messages. The researchers noted the Egyptian Revolution demonstrated the use of social media to rapidly spread messages of social change and mobilized large groups of people.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Another group of researchers studying social movements in [[Tunisia]] during the [[Arab Spring]] found cyber activism sprang from grievances about increasing government restrictions on Internet use for political purposes coupled with lack of socioeconomic opportunities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Breuer, Landman and Farquhar|year=2015|title=Social media and protest mobilization: Evidence from the Tunisian revolution| url= http://eprints.nottingham.ac.uk/33995/1/Tunisia%20Democratization%20proofs%20revised%20version.pdf|journal=Democratization|volume=22|issue=4|pages=764–792|via=|doi=10.1080/13510347.2014.885505}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Connection with other fields ==
Resource mobilization theory has been studied in conjunction with other fields, such as [[Framing (social sciences)|framing theory]]. Evidence has been found of an evolving relationship between framing processes and social movements. This relationship has led to the identification of two frames used in social movement stories: diagnostic, which involves identifying the sources of causality or blame for the situation, and prognostic, which lays out a plan of attack on how to create social change.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Benford and Snow|year=2000|title=Framing processes and social movements: An overview and assessment|url=http://www.unc.edu/~fbaum/teaching/articles/AnnRevSoc-2000-Benford.pdf|journal=Annual Review of Sociology|volume=26|pages=611–639|via=|doi=10.1146/annurev.soc.26.1.611}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Virgin and the Gypsy''''' is a 1970 British [[drama film]] directed by [[Christopher Miles]], based on the [[The Virgin and the Gypsy|novella of the same name]]. It was screened at the [[1970 Cannes Film Festival]], but wasn't entered into the main competition.&lt;ref name="festival-cannes.com"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.festival-cannes.com/en/archives/ficheFilm/id/2504/year/1970.html |title=Festival de Cannes: The Virgin and the Gypsy |accessdate=11 April 2009|work=festival-cannes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
Based on a 1926 work by [[D.H. Lawrence]], the film follows two sisters, Lucille and Yvette, who come to the English countryside for a vacation. Along the way, Yvette is interested in a gypsy who lives not far from her family's home.

{{Nihongo|'''Tsuruma Central Library'''|鶴舞中央図書館|tsuruma chūō toshokan}} is a [[Public Library]] serving [[Nagoya, Aichi]], [[Japan]].  It was established in 1923 but burned down in 1945 in the [[Second World War]] and reopened in 1952.  It is closed every Monday, unless that Monday is a national holiday, in which case the library is instead closed on the next weekday.  It is also closed on every third Friday of the month and for about a week for the [[Japanese New Year]].&lt;ref name="nagoya"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.library.city.nagoya.jp/guide/m_tsuruma.html |script-title=ja:鶴舞中央図書館 |language=Japanese |accessdate=27 December 2010 |publisher=Nagoya City}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is located in [[Tsuruma Park]], close to [[Tsurumai Station]] on the [[Nagoya Municipal Subway|subway]] and [[Central Japan Railway Company|JR]] rail lines.

==Name==
Despite being located in an area called Tsurumai, the name of the library and the park that it is located in are named Tsuruma without an "i."  This is despite the fact that the place name "Tsurumai" and the library name "Tsuruma" are written the same way in Japanese in [[kanji]].

The '''''Winged Victory of Samothrace''''', also called the '''''[[Nike (mythology)|Nike]] of Samothrace''''',&lt;ref&gt;In [[Greek language|Greek]] the statue is called the ''Niki tis Samothrakis'' (Νίκη της Σαμοθράκης) and in [[French language|French]] ''La Victoire de Samothrace''. There are two further statues of Winged Victory found in the [[Samothrace temple complex]]: a Roman copy found by a team of Austrian archaeologists, now at the [[Kunsthistorisches Museum]], Vienna, and a third Winged Victory found by Dr. Phyllis Williams Lehmann in 1949, now in a museum at the Samothrace site.&lt;/ref&gt; is a marble [[Hellenistic sculpture]] of [[Nike (mythology)|Nike]] (the [[Greek mythology|Greek goddess]] of victory), that was created about the 2nd century BC. Since 1884, it has been prominently displayed at the [[Louvre]] and is one of the most celebrated sculptures in the world. [[H. W. Janson|H.W. Janson]] described it as "the greatest masterpiece of Hellenistic sculpture",&lt;ref name=Janson/&gt;  and it is one of a small number of major Hellenistic statues surviving in the original, rather than Roman copies.

==Description==
The context of the ''Winged Victory of Samothrace'', discovered in 1863, is controversial, with proposals ranging from the [[Battle of Salamis (306 BC)|Battle of Salamis]] in 306 BC to the [[Battle of Actium]] in 31 BC as the event being celebrated.  Datings based on stylistic evaluation have been equally variable, ranging across the same three centuries, but perhaps tending to an earlier date.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, 78&lt;/ref&gt; For much of the 20th century, the prevailing theory, based on the works of Hermann Thiersch and Karl Lehmann, considered it a [[Rhodes|Rhodian]] monument dedicated following the victories at [[Side, Turkey|Side]] and [[Battle of Myonessus|Myonessos]] in 190 BC, and suggested that it might have been carved by the Rhodian sculptor Pythocritus.{{sfn|Stewart|2016|p=399}} However, in recent years, the reconstructions of the monument proposed by Lehmann have been shown to be false (the remains of the surrounding space that housed the ''Victory'' belong to the Roman period), and the question of why the statue was dedicated on Samothrace, which at the time was dominated by the Greek Kingdom of [[Macedonia (ancient kingdom)|Macedonia]], remains unanswered.{{sfn|Stewart|2016|p=400}}

The statue is {{convert|244|cm|ft}} high.&lt;ref name=HF&gt;[[Hugh Honour|Honour, H.]] and J. Fleming, (2009) ''A World History of Art''. 7th edn. London: Laurence King Publishing, p. 174. {{ISBN|9781856695848}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was created not only to honor the goddess, Nike, but also to honor a sea battle. It conveys a sense of action and triumph as well as portraying artful flowing drapery, as though the goddess were descending to alight upon the prow of a ship.

Modern excavations suggest that the ''Victory'' occupied a niche above a theater and also suggest it accompanied an altar that was within view of the ship monument of [[Demetrius I Poliorcetes]] (337–283 BC). Rendered in grey and white [[Thasians#Geology|Thasian]] and [[Parian marble]], the figure originally formed part of the [[Samothrace temple complex]] dedicated to the Great gods, ''Megaloi Theoi''. It stood on a rostral pedestal of gray marble from [[Lartos]] representing the [[prow]] of a ship (most likely a [[trihemiolia]]), and represents the goddess as she descends from the skies to the triumphant fleet. Before she lost her arms, which have never been recovered, Nike's right arm is believed to have been raised,&lt;ref&gt;The flex of her torso reveals the movement of her missing arm.&lt;/ref&gt; cupped round her mouth to deliver the shout of Victory.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.louvre.fr/llv/oeuvres/detail_notice.jsp?CONTENT%3C%3Ecnt_id=10134198673225805&amp;CURRENT_LLV_NOTICE%3C%3Ecnt_id=10134198673225805&amp;FOLDER%3C%3Efolder_id=9852723696500817&amp;bmLocale=en Louvre Website]: the discovery of her right hand, identified by [[Phyllis Williams Lehmann]], now also at the Louvre, settled questions of her gesture, whether to bring a trumpet to her lips as she is depicted on earlier coins or bearing a wreath to crown the naval victor.&lt;/ref&gt; The work is notable for its convincing rendering of a pose where violent motion and sudden stillness meet, for its graceful balance and for the rendering of the figure's draped garments, compellingly depicted as if rippling in a strong sea breeze. Similar traits can be seen in the ''[[Laocoön and His Sons|Laocoön group]]'' which is a reworked copy of a lost original that was likely close both in time and place of origin to Nike, but while ''Laocoon'', vastly admired by [[Renaissance]] and classicist artists, has come to be seen {{By whom|date=June 2011}} as a more self-conscious and contrived work, ''Nike of Samothrace'' is seen as an iconic depiction of triumphant spirit and of the divine momentarily coming face to face with man.

The statue’s outstretched right wing is a symmetric plaster version of the original left one. The stylistic portrayal of the wings is a source of scholarly discussion, as the feather pattern resembles neither the wings of birds in nature nor wings in Greek art.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://nationalhumanitiescenter.org/bonna-wescoat-new-research-on-the-nike-of-samothrace/|title="From the Vantage of the Victory: New Research on the Nike of Samothrace" - National Humanities Center|last=Bonna|first=Wescoat|date=2015-01-22|work=National Humanities Center|access-date=2017-10-01|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|at=20:08-23:40|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; As with the arms, the figure's head has never been found, but various other fragments have since been found: in 1950, a team led by Karl Lehmann unearthed the missing right hand of the Louvre's ''Winged Victory''. The fingerless hand had slid out of sight under a large rock, near where the statue had originally stood; on the return trip home, Dr [[Phyllis Williams Lehmann]] identified the tip of the Goddess's ring finger and her thumb in a storage drawer at the [[Kunsthistorisches Museum]], Vienna, where the second ''Winged Victory'' is displayed; the fragments have been reunited with the hand,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2004/10/16/national/16lehmann.html ''New York Times'', Obituary of Phyllis Williams Lehmann, 16 October 2004].&lt;/ref&gt; which is now in a glass case in the [[Louvre]] next to the podium on which the statue stands.

The different degree of finishing of the sides has led scholars to think that it was intended to be seen from three-quarters on the left.

A partial inscription on the base of the statue includes the word "Rhodios" (Rhodian), indicating that the statue was commissioned to celebrate a naval victory by [[Rhodes]], at that time the most powerful [[Maritime nation|maritime]] state in the [[Aegean Sea|Aegean]] which in itself would date the statue to 288 BC at the earliest.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}}

==History==
[[File:Nike descending staircase 3sept1939.jpg|thumb|right|The great statue was carefully lowered down a ramp in 1939 when it was removed from the Louvre and Paris for safekeeping.]]

The sculptor is unknown,&lt;ref&gt;Waxman, Sharon, ''Lost: The Battle over the Stolen Treasures of the Ancient World''. Time Books, 2008, p. 82.&lt;/ref&gt; although [[Paul MacKendrick]] suggests that Pythokritos of [[Lindos]] is responsible.&lt;ref&gt;MacKendrick, Paul, ''The Greek Stones Speak'', Norton &amp; Company 1962&lt;/ref&gt;  When first discovered on the island of [[Samothrace]] (then part of the [[Ottoman Empire]] and called ''Semadirek'') and published in 1863, it was suggested that the ''Victory'' was erected by the [[Ancient Macedonians|Macedonian]] general [[Demetrius I of Macedon|Demetrius Poliorcetes]] after his [[Battle of Salamis (306 BC)|naval victory]] at [[Cyprus]], between 295 and 289 BC. The [[Archaeological Museum of Samothrace]] continues to follow these originally established provenance and dates.&lt;ref&gt;Hatzfeld pointed out in 1910 that Samothrace was in the possession of Demetrios' bitter personal enemy [[Lysimachus]], who would not have permitted the erection of such a monument.&lt;/ref&gt; Ceramic evidence discovered in recent excavations has revealed that the pedestal was set up about 200 BC, though some scholars still date it as early as 250 BC or as late as 180.&lt;ref&gt;Haskell, Francis and Nicholas Penny. (1981) ''Taste and the Antique: the Lure of Classical Sculpture 1500–1900''. New Haven: [[Yale University Press]], p. 333. {{ISBN|0-300-02641-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Certainly, the parallels with figures and drapery from the [[Pergamon Altar]] (dated about 170 BC) seem strong. The evidence for a Rhodian commission of the statue has been questioned, however, and the closest artistic parallel to the Nike of Samothrace are figures depicted on Macedonian coins.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, 1991. ''Hellenistic Sculpture (World of Art)''.&lt;/ref&gt; Samothrace was an important sanctuary for the Hellenistic Macedonian kings. The most likely battle commemorated by this monument is, perhaps, the [[Battle of Cos]] in 255 BC, in which [[Antigonus II Gonatas]] of Macedonia won over the fleet of [[Ptolemy II Philadelphus|Ptolemy II]] of Egypt.&lt;ref&gt;Burn, 2005. ''Hellenistic Art: From Alexander the Great to Augustus''.&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 1863, the ''Victory'' was discovered by the then French consul in [[Adrianopolis]] and amateur archaeologist Charles Champoiseau (1830-1909), who sent it to Paris in the same year. The statue has been reassembled in stages since its discovery. The prow was reconstructed from marble debris at the site by Champoiseau in 1879 and assembled in situ before being shipped to Paris.

After 1884, the statue was positioned where it would visually dominate the Daru staircase.&lt;ref&gt;The monumental ''Escalier Daru'' designed by [[Hector Lefuel]] to replace the former staircase of the ''[[Musée Napoléon (Paris)|Musée Napoléon]]'' was constructed from 1855 to 1857 in the ''Pavillon Daru'', named for a minister of [[Napoleon III]]. At the fall of the [[Second French Empire|Second Empire]] it remained incomplete; it was finished in 1883 as a setting for the ''Victory of Samothrace'' (Louvre website).&lt;/ref&gt; Since 1883, the marble figure has been displayed in the Louvre, while a [[plaster]] [[replica]] stands in the museum at the original location of the Sanctuary of the Great Gods on Samothrace.

In the autumn of 1939, the Winged Victory was removed from her perch in anticipation of the outbreak of [[World War II]]. All the museums of Paris were closed on August 25. Artwork and objects were packed for removal to locations deemed more safe outside Paris for safekeeping&lt;ref&gt;See also [[Evacuation of the Louvre museum art collection during World War II]]&lt;/ref&gt;.  On the night of September 3, the statue descended the staircase on a wooden ramp which was constructed across the steps.&lt;ref&gt;Nicholas, Lynn H. (1994) ''The Rape of Europa: The Fate of Europe's Treasures in the Third Reich and the Second World War''. New York: [[Alfred A. Knopf]], pp. 54–55. {{ISBN|978-0-679-40069-1}}; OCLC 246524635&lt;/ref&gt; During the years of World War II, the statue sheltered in safety in the [[Château de Valençay]] along with the ''[[Venus de Milo]]'' and [[Dying Slave|Michelangelo's ''Slaves'']].&lt;ref&gt;Nicholas, p. 87.&lt;/ref&gt;

The discovery in 1948 of the hand raised in salute, which matched a fragment in Vienna, established the modern reconstruction—without trumpet—of the hand raised in [[Epiphany (feeling)|epiphanic]] greeting.{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}

==2013–14 restoration==
[[File:Nike of Samothrace Musée du Louvre 20141107 125035.jpg|thumb|right|''The Winged Victory of Samothrace'', side view.]]
In 2013 a restoration effort was launched to improve the appearance of the sculpture.  This was the first detailed examination of the individual pieces of the sculpture to date.  The restoration aimed to restore the marble to its original hue which had been tarnished by time.  The sculpture was removed from its base and carried into an adjoining room which was transformed for the occasion into a restoration workshop.  The base was dismantled block by block and placed in the workshop. Scientific reviews were performed on the base ([[Ultraviolet–visible spectroscopy|UV]], [[Infrared spectroscopy|Infrared]], [[X-ray spectroscopy]]) prior to cleaning the surface of the marble. This effort aimed to respect the goals of the original restoration performed in 1883. The surface of the base was cleaned and then reassembled, and some gaps in the marble were repaired. Upon completion of the restoration, the statue was reunited with its base and returned to its prior position at the head of the Daru staircase in the Louvre.

==Assessment, reception and influence==
[[File:Winged Victory of Samothrace side.jpg|thumb|right|''The Winged Victory of Samothrace'', before restoration.]]
Despite its significant damage and incompleteness, the ''Victory'' is held to be one of the great surviving masterpieces of sculpture from the Hellenistic Period, and from the entire Greco-Roman era. The statue shows a mastery of form and movement which has impressed critics and artists since its discovery. It is considered one of the Louvre's greatest treasures, and since the late 19th century it has been displayed in the most dramatic fashion, at the head of the sweeping Daru staircase.

The art historian [[H. W. Janson]] has pointed out&lt;ref name=Janson/&gt; that unlike earlier Greek or Near Eastern sculptures, ''Nike'' creates a deliberate relationship to the imaginary space around the goddess. The wind that has carried her and which she is fighting off, straining to keep steady – as mentioned the original mounting had her standing on a ship's prow, just having landed – is the invisible complement of the figure and the viewer is made to imagine it. At the same time, this expanded space heightens the symbolic force of the work; the wind and the sea are suggested as metaphors of struggle, destiny and divine help or grace. This kind of interplay between a statue and the space conjured up would become a common device in baroque and romantic art, about two thousand years later. It is present in [[Michelangelo]]'s sculpture of [[David (Michelangelo)|''David'']]: David's gaze and pose shows where he is seeing his adversary Goliath and his awareness of the moment – but it is rare in ancient art.

The ''Victory'' soon became a cultural icon to which artists responded in many different ways. For example, [[Abbott Handerson Thayer]]'s ''A Virgin'' (1892–93) is a well-known painted allusion. When [[Filippo Tommaso Marinetti]] issued his [[Futurist Manifesto]] in 1909, he chose to contrast his movement with the supposedly defunct artistic sentiments of the Winged Victory: "a race-automobile which seems to rush over exploding powder is more beautiful than the 'Victory of Samothrace{{'"}}.

The 1913 sculpture ''[[Unique Forms of Continuity in Space]]'' by the Futuristic sculptor [[Umberto Boccioni]], currently located at the Museum of Modern Art ([[MoMA]]) in New York, was influenced by the statue, and is said to bear an underlying resemblance to it.&lt;ref&gt;Museum of Modern Art, New York: [http://www.moma.org/collection/printable_view.php?object_id=81179 ''Unique Forms of Continuity in Space''].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Campaign for repatriation==
On February 3, 1999, according to the [[Macedonian Press Agency]]: News in English, "residents of the Aegean island of Samothrace, the birthplace of the renowned Greek sculpture Nike of Samothrace, aka the Winged Victory, embarked on a letter-writing campaign to have this finest extant of Hellenistic sculpture returned to their homeland.
In a letter signed by the island's mayor, the locals urged Greek politicians to intervene and request that the Louvre museum, where the statue is kept, acknowledge that the sculpture belongs in its natural environment."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Numerous copies exist in museums and galleries around the world; one of the best-known copies stands outside the [[Caesars Palace]] casino in [[Las Vegas, Nevada|Las Vegas]]. The first [[FIFA World Cup]] [[FIFA World Cup Trophy|trophy]], commissioned in 1930 and designed by [[Abel Lafleur]], was based on the model.

This statue was a favorite of [[Frank Lloyd Wright]] and he used reproductions of it in a number of his buildings, including [[Willits House|Ward Willits House]], [[Darwin D. Martin House]] and [[Dr. John Storer House|Storer House]].

The largest public sculpture based on Nike appears in a prominent position atop the massive [[Pennsylvania State Memorial]] at [[Gettysburg National Military Park]] in Pennsylvania. Philadelphia sculptor [[Samuel Murray]], a student and intimate of painter [[Thomas Eakins]], produced the 28-foot figure in 1911 with possible influence from [[Augustus Saint-Gaudens]]' Nike interpretation on the [[William Tecumseh Sherman (Saint-Gaudens)|Sherman Memorial]] in New York City (1903). Saint-Gaudens depicts Nike with her right arm raised while it is thought the original Nike was not making such gesture. Saint-Gaudens' Nike also wears a [[laurel wreath]] on her head and bears a large [[olive branch]] in her left hand. Murray adapted the laurel wreath and olive branch innovations but also placed a sword in Nike's raised right hand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://npsgnmp.wordpress.com/2016/04/30/winged-victory-a-closer-look-at-the-pennsylvania-memorial|title=Winged Victory: A Closer Look at the Pennsylvania Memorial|website=The Blog of Gettysburg National Military Park|date=April 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Starting in 1962, [[Yves Klein]] produced a series of plaster replicas of the ''Nike'' coated in dry pigment of his signature [[International Klein Blue]] affixed by resin entitled ''Victoire de Samatrace''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.galerieomagh.com/en/oeuvres/victoire-de-samothrace/|title=Samothrace Victory – Galerie Omagh|website=www.galerieomagh.com|access-date=2016-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Swedish author [[Gunnar Ekelöf]] made ''Nike'' a central image in his poem ''Samothrace'', written in 1941,&lt;ref&gt;In Ekelöf, ''[[Non Serviam (book)|Non Serviam]]'', Bonniers, Stockholm 1945, and in later collected editions of his poems.&lt;/ref&gt; where the faceless deity, arms outstretched like sails, is made into a symbol of the fight and the coming victory against Nazism and the struggle for freedom throughout history. It also features in the Matthew Reilly novel ''[[Seven Ancient Wonders]]'', where it is fictionally made part of the [[Statue of Zeus at Olympia]].

A full-size replica of the statue sits in [[The Ohio State University]]'s [[William Oxley Thompson Memorial Library|Thompson Library]] in Columbus, Ohio.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thelantern.com/2013/03/winged-victory-replica-statue-placed-in-thompson-library-100-year-history-with-ohio-state/|title=Winged Victory replica statue placed in Thompson Library, 100 year history with Ohio State|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Another full size replica stands in the lobby of [[Crouse College, Syracuse University|Crouse College]], home to the Setnor School of Music, at [[Syracuse University]] in Syracuse, New York.  A {{convert|7|ft|adj=on}} replica of the sculpture stands at Connecticut College in New London, Connecticut.  The second-largest replica of this statue in the United States stands at [[Calvary Catholic Cemetery (Pittsburgh)|Calvary Catholic Cemetery]] in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, and is {{convert|10|ft|abbr=on}} high.

[[Texas Woman's University]] in Denton, Texas has a replica which was purchased from the [[Louvre]] and shipped from Paris in 1982. This replica is actually a replacement of the original 1929 replica given to commemorate [[Armistice Day]] and the defeat of autocracy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Campus Art – TWU TWU Libraries – Texas Woman's University|url = http://www.twu.edu/library/campus-art.asp|website = www.twu.edu|accessdate = 2015-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A replica of the statue sits overlooking the Veterans area of the [[Skylawn Memorial Park (San Mateo, California)|Skylawn Memorial Park]] in San Mateo, California.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.skylawnmemorialpark.com/who-we-are/history-and-staff|title=About Us - Skylawn Memorial Park - Funeral - Cremation - Cremation|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Estrugamou Building]] in [[Buenos Aires]], [[Argentina]] was built in four sections, arranged around a patio adorned with a bronze copy of the iconic Winged Victory of Samothrace.  The [[Cape Town Cenotaph]] is topped by a replica of the Winged Victory of Samothrace by British sculptor [[Vernon March]].  Another plaster replica adorns the atrium of [[Technische Universität Berlin]]. The replica was a gift by French universities to the TU Berlin in 1956.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pressestelle.tu-berlin.de/menue/service_fuer_journalisten/fotoarchiv/kunstwerke/?showp=4&amp;uid=24994#24994|title=Stabsstelle Presse, Öffentlichkeitsarbeit und Alumni: Kunstwerke|website=www.pressestelle.tu-berlin.de}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Augustus Saint-Gaudens]]' 1903 [[horseback riding|equestrian]] statue of General [[William Tecumseh Sherman]] in [[Grand Army Plaza (Manhattan)|Grand Army Plaza]], [[New York City]], depicts a robed, winged [[Nike (mythology)|Nike]] leading Sherman while holding a palm branch, as a symbol of his victory in the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] and the peace to follow.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ctmonuments.net/2011/04/grand-army-plaza-new-york-ny/|title=Grand Army Plaza, New York, NY - CT Monuments.net|website=ctmonuments.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Graffiti artist [[Banksy]] created ''CCTV Angel'' in 2006 depicting a robed, winged figure with a [[CCTV camera]] for a head, as a statement on the overreach with [[security]] [[surveillance]] in society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.artnet.com/artists/banksy/cctv-angel-ibzvf7akWuiZWtBmBNeoUA2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8824">Women have made significant contributions to [[literature]] from the earliest times. The involvement of women in writing occurred in several early civilizations.

==History==

One of the earliest known female writer was [[Enheduanna]], whom also is the earliest known [[poet]] whose name has been recorded. She was the [[Ordination of women#Sumeria and Akkadia|High Priestess]] of the goddess [[Inanna]] and the moon god [[Nanna (Sumerian deity)|Nanna]] (Sin). She lived in the [[Sumer]]ian city-state of [[Ur]].&lt;ref&gt;''Gods, Demons, and Symbols of Ancient Mesopotamia: An Illustrated Dictionary'' by Jeremy Black and Anthony Green (1992, {{ISBN|0-292-70794-0}}), p. 134 (entry "Nanna-Suen").&lt;/ref&gt;

Enheduanna's contributions to [[Sumerian literature]], definitively ascribed to her, include several personal devotions to Inanna and a collection of hymns known as the "Sumerian Temple Hymns". Further additional texts are ascribed to her.&lt;ref&gt;[[William W. Hallo|Hallo]] and Van Dijk 1968 p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; This makes her the first named author in world history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Roberta Binkley|title=Rhetoric before and beyond the Greeks|year=2004|publisher=SUNY Press|isbn=9780791460993|pages=47|chapter=Reading the Ancient Figure of Enheduanna}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She was the first known woman to hold the title of [[EN (cuneiform)|EN]], a role of great political importance that was often held by royal daughters.&lt;ref&gt;J Renger 1967: "Untersuchungen zum Priestertum in der altbabylonischen Zeit", ''Zeitschrift für Assyriologie und vorderasiatische Archäologie''. Vol. 58. p. 118.&lt;/ref&gt; She was appointed to the role by her father, King [[Sargon of Akkad]]. Her mother was probably Queen [[Tashlultum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Women, Crime, and Punishment in Ancient Law and Society: The ancient Near East |author=Elisabeth Meier Tetlow |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ONkJ_Rj1SS8C&amp;pg=PA245&amp;dq=Tashlultum#v=onepage&amp;q=Tashlultum&amp;f=false |publisher=[[Continuum International Publishing Group]] |isbn=978-0-8264-1628-5 |year=2004 |accessdate=29 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Mesopotamia and the ancient Near East |author=Michael Roaf |authorlink=Michael Roaf |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SapVAAAAYAAJ&amp;q=Tashlultum&amp;dq=Tashlultum|publisher=Stonehenge Press |isbn=978-0-86706-681-4 |year=1992 |accessdate=29 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Enheduanna was appointed to the role of High Priestess in a shrewd political move by Sargon to help secure power in the south of his kingdom, where the City of Ur was located.&lt;ref name="Franke, p. 831"&gt;Franke, p. 831&lt;/ref&gt;

===7th century B.C.===
'''Sappho''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|s|æ|f|oʊ}}; [[Aeolic Greek]] {{lang|grc|Ψαπφώ}} ''Psapphô''; c. 630 &amp;ndash; c. 570 BC) was an [[archaic Greek]] poet from the island of [[Lesbos]].{{efn|The fragments of Sappho's poetry are conventionally referred to by fragment number, though some also have one or more common names. The most commonly used numbering system is that of E. M. Voigt, which in most cases matches the older Lobel-Page system. Unless otherwise specified, the numeration in this article is from Diane Rayor and André Lardinois' ''Sappho: A New Translation of the Complete Works'', which uses Voigt's numeration with some variations to account for the fragments of Sappho discovered since Voigt's edition was published.}} Sappho is known for her [[Greek lyric|lyric poetry]], written to be sung while accompanied by a lyre.{{sfn|Freeman|2016|p=8}} Most of Sappho's poetry is now lost, and what is extant has survived only in fragmentary form, except for one complete poem: the "[[Ode to Aphrodite]]". As well as lyric poetry, ancient commentators claimed that Sappho wrote elegiac and iambic poetry. Three epigrams attributed to Sappho are extant, but these are actually [[Hellenistic]] imitations of Sappho's style.

===15th century===

[[Christine de Pizan]] was the most know late medieval French writer, rhetorician, and critic, wrote ''[[Book of the City of Ladies]]'' in 1405, a text about an allegorical city in which independent women lived free from the slander of men. In her work she included real women artists, such as [[Anastasia (artist)|Anastasia]], who was considered one of the best Parisian illuminators, although none of her work has survived. Other humanist texts led to increased education for Italian women.

===18th century===

She wrote two additional novels, ''[[Northanger Abbey]]'' and ''[[Persuasion (novel)|Persuasion]]'', both published posthumously in 1818, and began another, eventually titled ''[[Sanditon]]'', but died before its completion.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3655">[[File:World Map 1-2,500,000 grid.svg|thumb|Division of the world into the sheets of the map series]]

The '''World Map 1:2,500,000''' ({{lang-ru|Карта Мира 1:2,500,000}}) is an internationally standardized and edited [[map series]]. The term ''Карта Мира'' or in transcription ''Karta Mira'' is now commonly used to describe this series, even outside the [[Soviet Union]] or [[Russia]].  The ''Karta Mira'' consists of a total of 224 (#1-17 &amp; 28-234) main sheets and 38 overlap sheets (although at least 10 were dropped). They depict the entire earth (land and water surfaces) according to a uniform scale, coloring and drawing system. The ''Karta Mira 1956-1975'' was produced by cartographers from [[Bulgaria]], [[Czechoslovakia]], the [[German Democratic Republic]], [[Hungary]], [[Poland]], [[Romania]] and the Soviet Union.

The production of a 1:2,500,000 scale map of the world had been discussed since the late 1940s, partly because many cartographers were dissatisfied with the work on the [[International Map of the World]] (or ''Millionth Map'', after its scale of 1:1,000,000).  Due to the destruction of the ''Central Bureau of the Map of the World'' in London during [[World War II]], the Millionth Map had suffered a serious setback, and it was uncertain whether that series could ever be completed.

The initiative for the production of the Karta Mira was taken by cartographers from Hungary ([[Alexander Radó]], Peter Halasz, E. Foldi, Istvan Joo), the Soviet Union (Grigory A. Ginzburg (Григорий А. Гинзбург), Ilya Andreyevich Kutuzov (Илья Андреевич Кутузов)) and the GDR (Erfried Haack, Horst Nischan, Manfred Pateisat).

Production of the 262 sheets was divided between the Geodetic Services of the participating countries.  Thus, the sheets to be produced in the GDR were printed by VEB Hermann Haack Geographisch-Kartographische Anstalt Gotha and VEB Kombinat Geodäsie und Kartographie in [[Leipzig]] and [[Potsdam]]. The sheets to be produced in the Soviet Union were created by the Department of Geodesy and Cartography (Главное Управление геодезии и картографии) in [[Moscow]]. Proofs of several of the sheets involved in the series were presented by East German cartographers at an international conference in [[Erfurt]] in December 1963.

The first four sheets were published in 1964, and the final sheets of the first edition in 1976.  Sheet were published in several versions: a full version, a version without contours (for social science thematic mapping) and a version without placenames and infrastructure (for scientific thematic mapping).
 
The title of each sheet was given in Cyrillic and Latin alphabets, but all placenames on the map itself were given only in the Latin alphabet.

Publication of a second edition began in 1989, but appears to have been abandoned with the collapse of the Communist regimes in the Eastern Bloc shortly thereafter.
