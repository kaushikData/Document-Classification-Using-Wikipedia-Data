      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6124">In [[optics]] and [[lens design]], the '''Abbe number''', also known as the '''V-number''' or '''constringence''' of a [[Transparency (optics)|transparent]] material, is a measure of the material's [[dispersion (optics)|dispersion]] (variation of [[refractive]] index versus wavelength), with high values of ''V'' indicating low dispersion. It is named after [[Ernst Abbe]] (1840–1905), the German physicist who defined it.

[[Image:RefractiveIndex3glasses.png|right|thumb|300px|Refractive index variation for SF-11 flint glass (upper graph), BK-7 borosilicate glass (middle curve), and fused quartz (dashed curve).]]
The Abbe number,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hovestadt|first=H.|title=Jena Glass and Its Scientific and Industrial Applications|year=1902|publisher=Macmillan and Co.|location=London|pages=1–81}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bergmann|first=Ludwig|title=Optics of Waves and Particles|year=1999|publisher=Walter de Gruyter|location=Berlin|isbn=3-11-014318-6|pages=198–201|author2=Clemens Schaefer}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''V&lt;sub&gt;D&lt;/sub&gt;'', of a material is defined as

:&lt;math&gt;V_D = \frac{ n_D - 1 }{ n_F - n_C },&lt;/math&gt;

where ''n''&lt;sub&gt;D&lt;/sub&gt;, ''n''&lt;sub&gt;F&lt;/sub&gt; and ''n''&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt; are the refractive indices of the material at the wavelengths of the [[Fraunhofer lines|Fraunhofer]] D-, F- and C- [[spectral line]]s (589.3 [[nanometre|nm]], 486.1&amp;nbsp;nm and 656.3&amp;nbsp;nm respectively). 

Abbe numbers are used to classify [[glass]] and other optical materials in terms of their chromaticity. For example, the higher dispersion [[flint glass]]es have ''V''&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;55 whereas the lower dispersion [[crown glass (optics)|crown glass]]es have larger Abbe numbers. Values of ''V'' range from below 25 for very dense flint glasses, around 34 for [[polycarbonate]] plastics, up to 65 for common crown glasses, and 75 to 85 for some fluorite and phosphate crown glasses. 

[[File:Eyesensitivity.svg|thumb|Most of the human eye's wavelength sensitivity curve, shown here, is bracketted by the Abbe number reference wavelengths of 486.1&amp;nbsp;nm (blue) and 656.3&amp;nbsp;nm (red)]]Abbe numbers are used in the design of [[achromatic lens]]es, as their ''reciprocal'' is proportional to dispersion (slope of refractive index versus wavelength) in the wavelength region where the human eye is most sensitive (see graph). For different wavelength regions, or for higher precision in characterizing a system's chromaticity (such as in the design of [[apochromat]]s), the full dispersion relation (refractive index as a function of wavelength) is used.

== Abbe diagram ==
[[Image:Abbe-diagram 2.svg|right|thumb|380px|An Abbe diagram, also known as 'the glass veil',  plots the Abbe number against refractive index for a range of different glasses (red dots). Glasses are classified using the Schott Glass letter-number code to reflect their composition and position on the diagram.]]
[[Image:SpiderGraph Abbe Number-en.svg|250px|thumb|Influences of selected [[glass]] component additions on the Abbe number of a specific base glass.&lt;ref&gt;[http://glassproperties.com/abbe_number/ Abbe number calculation of glasses]&lt;/ref&gt;]]
An '''Abbe diagram''', also called 'the glass veil', is produced by plotting the Abbe number ''V''&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt; of a material versus its refractive index ''n''&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt;. Glasses can then be categorised and selected according to their positions on the diagram. This can be a letter-number code, as used in the [[Schott Glass]] catalogue, or a 6-digit [[glass code]].

Glasses' Abbe numbers, along with their mean refractive indices, are used in the calculation of the required [[refractive power]]s of the elements of [[achromatic lenses]] in order to cancel [[chromatic aberration]] to first order. Note that these two parameters which enter into the equations for design of achromatic doublets are exactly what is plotted on an Abbe diagram.

Due to the difficulty and inconvenience in producing sodium and hydrogen lines, alternate definitions of the Abbe number are often substituted ([[ISO]] 7944).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Meister|first=Darryl|title=Understanding Reference Wavelengths|url=http://www.opticampus.com/files/memo_on_reference_wavelengths.pdf|publisher=Carl Zeiss Vision|accessdate=2013-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rather than the standard definition, above, using the refractive index variation between the F and C [[Fraunhofer lines#Naming|hydrogen lines]], an alternative measure using the subscript "e"
:&lt;math&gt; V_e = \frac{n_e-1}{ n_{F'} - n_{C'}}&lt;/math&gt;
takes the difference between the refractive indices of the blue and red cadmium lines at 480.0&amp;nbsp;nm and 643.8&amp;nbsp;nm (with ''n&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;'' referring to the wavelength of the  mercury e-line, 546.073&amp;nbsp;nm). Other definitions can similarly be employed; the following table lists standard wavelengths at which n is commonly determined, including the standard subscripts employed.&lt;ref&gt;L. D. Pye, V. D. Frechette, N. J. Kreidl: "Borate Glasses"; Plenum Press, New York, 1977&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''ayllu''''' is the traditional form of a [[community]] in the [[Andes]], especially among [[Quechuas]] and [[Aymaras]]. They are an indigenous local government model across the [[Andes]] region of [[South America]], particularly in [[Bolivia]] and [[Peru]]. Ayllus functioned [[Pre-Inca cultures|prior to Inca conquest]], during the [[Tawantinsuyu|Inca]] and Spanish colonial period, and continue to exist to the present day.&lt;ref name=PolAnth /&gt; How the ancient form and current organization correspond is unclear, since Spanish chronicles do not give a precise definition of the term.&lt;ref&gt;Gordon F. McEwan, "Ayllu" in ''Encyclopedia of Latin American History and Culture'', vol. 1, p. 248. New York: Charles Scribner's Sons 1996.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ayllus had defined territories and were essentially extended family or kin groups, but they could include non-related members, giving individual families more variation and security of the land that they farmed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Beck | first = Roger B. | authorlink = |author2=Linda Black |author3=Larry S. Krieger |author4=Phillip C. Naylor |author5=Dahia Ibo Shabaka  | title = World History: Patterns of Interaction | publisher = McDougal Littell | year = 1999 | location = Evanston, IL | pages = | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = 0-395-87274-X }}&lt;/ref&gt; The male head of an ''ayllu'' is called a ''[[mallku]]'' which means, literally, [[condor]], but is a title which can be roughly translated as "prince". They would often have their own ''[[huaca|wak'a]]'', or minor god, usually embodied in a physical object such as a mountain or rock. "Ayullus were named for a particular person or place."&lt;ref&gt;McEwan, "Ayllu", p. 248.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ayllu were self-sustaining units and would educate their own offspring and farm or trade for all the food they ate, except in cases of disaster such as [[El Niño]] years when they relied on the Inca storehouse system.&lt;ref name="isbn=0-8094-9870-7"&gt;{{cite book |title=Incas: lords of gold and glory |publisher=Time-Life Books |location=New York |year=1992 |page=64 |isbn=0-8094-9870-7 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their primary function was to solve subsistence issues, and issues of how to get along in family, and larger, units.&lt;ref name="isbn0-8047-1339-1"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Earle, Timothy K. |author2=Johnson, Allen W. |title=The evolution of human societies: from foraging group to agrarian state |publisher=Stanford University Press |location=Stanford, Calif |year=1987 |page=263 |isbn=0-8047-1339-1 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Each ayllu owned a parcel of land, and the members had reciprocal obligations to each other.&lt;ref name="isbn0-521-31896-3"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Demarest, Arthur Andrew |author2=Conrad, Geoffrey W. |title=Religion and empire: the dynamics of Aztec and Inca expansionism |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge, UK |year=1984 |page=97 |isbn=0-521-31896-3 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[marriage]]s, the woman would generally join the class and ayllu of her partner as would her children, but would [[inheritance|inherit]] her land from her parents and retain her membership in her birth ayllu. This is how most movements of people between ayllu occurred. But a person could also join an ayllu by assuming the responsibility of membership. This included ''[[communal work|mink'a]]'', communal work for common purposes, ''[[ayni]]'', or work in kind for other members of the ayllu, and ''[[mit'a]],'' a form of taxation levied by the Inca government.&lt;ref name="isbn=0-8094-9870-7"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
“Ayllu solidarity is a combination of kinship and territorial ties, as well as symbolism. (Albo 1972; Duviols 1974; Tshopik 1951; and Urioste 1975). These studies, however, do  not explain how the ayllu is a corporate whole, which includes social principles, verticality, and metaphor... Ayllu also refers to people who live in the same territory (''llahta'') and who feed the earth shrines of that territory.”&lt;ref name="Bastien"&gt;Bastien, Joseph. ''Mountain of the Condor: Metaphor and Ritual in an Andean Ayllu''. 1978.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

''Ayllu'' is a word in both the [[Quechua language|Quechua]] and [[Aymara language|Aymara]] languages referring to a network of families in a given area, often with a putative or [[fictive kinship|fictive]] common ancestor.&lt;ref name=PolAnth&gt;{{Cite book | publisher = ABC-CLIO | isbn = 978-0-89789-891-1 | last = Lewellen | first = Ted C. | title = Political anthropology: An introduction | year = 2003 |pages = 38–39 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ayllus are distinguished by comparative [[self-sufficiency]], commonly held territory, and relations of reciprocity.&lt;ref name=PolAnth /&gt; Members engage in shared collective labor ({{lang-qu|minga}}) and in [[Mutual aid (organization theory)|reciprocal exchanges of assistance]] ({{lang-qu|[[ayni]]}}).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | publisher = Infobase Publishing | isbn = 978-0-7910-8095-5 | last = Bahr | first = Ann Marie B. |author2=Martin E. Marty | title = Indigenous religions | date = March 2005 | pages = 135–36}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Bolivia, representatives from the ayllus are sent to the [[National Council of Ayllus and Markas of Qullasuyu]] (Conamaq). This body chooses an [[Apu Mallku]] as its head.

'''Baker Glacier''' ({{Coord|72|46|S|169|15|E|source:GNIS|display=inline,title}}) is a small tributary [[glacier]] that enters [[Whitehall Glacier]] just north of [[Martin Hill (Antarctica)|Martin Hill]], in the [[Victory Mountains]] of [[Victoria Land]], [[Antarctica]]. It was mapped by the [[United States Geological Survey]] from surveys and from [[U.S. Navy]] air photos, 1960–62, and named by the [[Advisory Committee on Antarctic Names]] for [[John R. Baker (biologist with BAS)|John R. Baker]], biologist at [[Hallett Station]] in 1967–68 and 1968–69.

== Career ==
Dr. Anderson is a planetary astronomer in the Astrochemistry Laboratory at [[NASA]]'s [[Goddard Space Flight Center]], having joined NASA as a civil servant in 2009. She served as the Associate Chief of the Planetary Systems Laboratory from 2011 to 2016.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;

Anderson's scientific research focuses on the remote sensing of planetary atmospheres&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=MKDQ7Q0AAAAJ&amp;hl=en&amp;oi=ao |title=Google scholar profile: Carrie M. Anderson |publisher=[[Google Scholar]] |access-date=2018-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;, primarily in the areas of thermal structure and composition, using space- and ground-based data. Her earliest scientific work focused on the exosphere of [[Mercury (planet)]].&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal |url=https://doi.org/10.1029/2000JE001401 |title=Evidence of Space Weather at Mercury |journal=Journal of Geophysical Research: Planets |volume=106 |pages=20509 access–date=2018–05–07 |doi=10.1029/2000JE001401 |year=2001 |last1=Killen |first1=R.

Dr. Anderson’s research also includes transmission spectroscopy measurements of thin ice films using her SPECtroscopy of Titan-Related ice AnaLogs (SPECTRAL) high-vacuum chamber located in her Spectroscopy for Planetary ICes Environments (SPICE) laboratory.

Dr. Anderson’s more recent research concerns the atmosphere of Saturn's moon [[Titan (moon)|Titan]], which is, according to NASA, "a model for what the early Earth might have been like."&lt;ref name="Goddard2010"&gt; {{Cite web |url=https://svs.gsfc.nasa.gov/10705 |title=Taking on Titan: An Interview With Carrie Anderson |publisher=NASA |quote=Now, as a space scientist at NASA Goddard Space Flight Center, Carrie studies the atmosphere on Titan, one of Saturn's moons and the second largest moon in the solar system.

The '''Center for Media, Data and Society (CMDS)''' is a research center at [[Central European University]] (CEU) that focuses on media, communication and information policy. Located in Budapest, Hungary, CMDS produces scholarly and practice-oriented research about journalism, media freedom, and internet policy.  

== History and Network ==

The Center was founded over a decade ago as the Center for Media and Communication Studies.  It began in 2004, and was designed to serve as a focal point an international network of acclaimed scholars and academic institutions, whose research ranges from media and communications policy, fundamental communications rights through media and civil society and new media and digital technology to media in transition. In September 2014 it was relaunched as the Center for Media, Data and Society &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Name change| url=http://cmds.ceu.hu/article/2014-10-06/center-adopts-new-name}}&lt;/ref&gt;  to represent new interests in technology policy, and big data.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mission of CMDS |url=http://cmds.ceu.hu/mission}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Center has been led since September 2016 by Marius Dragomir, a media expert, journalist and scholar&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://cmds.ceu.edu/article/2016-07-01/marius-dragomir-appointed-director-center-media-data-and-society|title=Marius Dragomir Appointed Director of the Center for Media, Data and Society {{!}} CMDS|website=cmds.ceu.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-09-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Projects and Mission==
The Center’s research projects focus on identifying trends and challenges in the use of information technologies and advancing policy discussions about the regulation of data and media. The Center has an annual summer school on activism and digital media that draws democracy advocates, media activists, and civil rights campaigners from around the world to discuss policy and strategy.

'''Charles Jurine''' (1751–1819) was a [[Swiss (people)|Swiss]] [[zoologist]] who, inspired by a letter by [[Lazzaro Spallanzani]] to the Geneva Natural History Society, set about showing that [[bat]]s used their ears to navigate. He corresponded with Spallanzani, who confirmed his findings but their work was largely ignored until the 20th century when [[Donald Griffin]] and [[G. W. Pierce]] proposed [[animal echolocation|echolocation]].

{{linguistics}}
'''Collocational restriction''' is a linguistic term used in [[morphology (linguistics)|morphology]]. The term refers to the fact that in certain two-word phrases the meaning of an individual [[word]] is restricted to that particular [[phrase]] (cf. [[idiom]]). For instance: the [[adjective]] ''dry'' can only mean 'not sweet' in combination with the [[noun]] ''wine''.

A more illustrative example is the one given below:

*''white wine''
*''white coffee''
*''white noise''
*''white man''

All four instances of ''white'' can be said to be idiomatic because in combination with certain nouns the meaning of ''white'' changes. In none of the examples does ''white'' have its commonest meaning. Instead, in the examples above it means 'yellowish', 'brownish', 'containing many frequencies with about equal amplitude', and 'pinkish' or 'pale brown', respectively.

The '''Colorado School of Mines Geology Museum''' is a [[geology]] [[museum]] based in the [[Colorado School of Mines]], [[Golden, Colorado|Golden]], [[Colorado]], United States. It was established in 1873&lt;ref&gt;[http://gardnerhistory.com/sesquicentennialstories/golden/oldest.htm Golden's Oldest].&lt;/ref&gt; and opened in 1874.&lt;ref name="mines"&gt;[http://www.mines.edu/Geology_Museum Geology Museum], [[Colorado School of Mines]], USA.&lt;/ref&gt;

The museum has two floors in which it displays [[fossil]]s, [[gemstone]]s, [[meteorite]]s, [[mineral]]s, and [[mining]] artifacts, including the [[Colorado lunar sample displays]]. The museum acts as the Colorado state repository for mineral heritage.

The main emphasis of the [[interdisciplinarity]] is placed on the application and use of computer-based but also mathematical techniques in sport science, aiming in this way at the support and advancement of theory and practice in sports.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Link |first1=D. |last2=Lames |first2=M. |title=Sport Informatics - Historical Roots, Interdisciplinarity and Future Developments |journal=International Journal of Computer Science in Sport |date=2009 |volume=Volume 8 |issue=Edition 2 |pages=68-87}}&lt;/ref&gt; The reason why [[computer science]] has become an important partner for sport science is mainly connected with "the fact that the use of data and media, the design of models, the analysis of systems etc. increasingly requires the support of suitable tools and concepts which are developed and available in computer science".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Arnold Baca |title=Computer science in sport: an overview of history, present fields and future applications (part I) |year=2006}} IJCSS Special Edition 2/2006, 25-35.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Historical background ==
Going back in history, computers in sports were used for the first time in the 1960s, when the main purpose was to accumulate sports information. [[Database]]s were created and expanded in order to launch documentation and dissemination of publications like articles or books that contain any kind of knowledge related to sports science. Until the mid-1970s also the first organization in this area called IASI (International Association for Sports Information) was formally established. Congresses and meetings were organized more often with the aim of standardization and rationalization of sports documentation. Since at that time this area was obviously less computer-oriented, specialists talk about sports information rather than sports informatics when mentioning the beginning of this field of science.

Based on the progress of computer science and the invention of more powerful computer hardware in the 1970s, also the real history of computer science in sport began.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Jürgen Perl |title=Computer science in sport: an overview of history, present fields and future applications (part II) |year=2006}} IJCSS Special Edition 2/2006, 36-46.&lt;/ref&gt; This was as well the first time when this term was officially used and the initiation of a very important evolution in sports science.

In the early stages of this area statistics on biomechanical data, like different kinds of forces or rates, played a major role. Scientists started to analyze sports games by collecting and looking at such values and features in order to interpret them. Later on, with the continuous improvement of computer hardware - in particular microprocessor speed – many new scientific and computing paradigms were introduced, which were also integrated in computer science in sport. Specific examples are [[Computer model|modeling]] as well as [[simulation]], but also [[pattern recognition]], design, and (sports) [[data mining]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Bahadorreza Ofoghi |author2=John Zeleznikow |author3=Clare MacMahon |author4=Markus Raab |title=Data mining in elite sports: A review and a framework |year=2013 |journal=Measurement in Physical Education and Exercise Science | volume=17 | issue=3 |url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/1091367X.2013.805137#.VI-ipE103Dc |doi=10.1080/1091367X.2013.805137 |pages=171–186}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Iztok Fister Jr. |author2=Karin Ljubič |author3=Ponnuthrai Nagaratnam Suganthan |author4=Matjaž Perc |author5=Iztok Fister |title=Computational intelligence in sports: Challenges and opportunities within a new research domain |year=2015 |journal=Applied Mathematics and Computation | volume=262 |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0096300315004300 |doi=10.1016/j.amc.2015.04.004 |pages=178–186}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As another result of this development, the term 'computer science in sport' has been added in the encyclopedia of sports science in 2004.

== Areas of research ==
The importance and strong influence of computer science as an interdisciplinary partner for sport and sport science is mainly proven by the research activities in computer science in sport. The following IT concepts are thereby of particular interest:

* [[Data acquisition]] and [[data processing]]
* Databases and [[expert system]]s
* Modelling (mathematical, IT based, biomechanical, physiological)
* Simulation (interactive, animation etc.)
* Presentation

Based on the fields from above, the main areas of research in computer science in sport include amongst others:

* [[Training]] and coaching
* [[Biomechanics]]
* [[Sports equipment]] and technology
* Computer-aided applications (software, hardware) in sports
* [[Ubiquitous computing]] in sports
* [[Multimedia]] and [[Internet]]
* Documentation
* Education

== Research communities ==
A clear demonstration for the evolution and propagation towards computer science in sport is also the fact that nowadays people do research in this area all over the world. Since the 1990s many new national and international organizations regarding the topic of computer science in sport were established. These associations are regularly organizing congresses and workshops with the aim of dissemination as well as exchange of scientific knowledge and information on all sort of topics regarding the interdisciplinary discipline.

=== Historical survey ===
As a first example, in [[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]] scientists have built up the MathSport group of [[ANZIAM]] (Australia and New Zealand Industrial and Applied Mathematics), which since 1992 organizes biennial meetings, initially under the name "Mathematics and Computers in Sport Conferences", and now "[[MathSport]]".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.anziam.org.au/MathSport MathSport], www.anziam.org.au&lt;/ref&gt; Main topics are mathematical models and computer applications in sports, as well as coaching and teaching methods based on informatics.

The European community was also among the leading motors of the emergence of the field. Some workshops on this topic were successfully organized in Germany since the late 1980s. In 1997 the first international meeting on computer science in sport was held in Cologne. The main aim was to spread out and share applications, ideas and concepts of the use of computers in sports, which should also make a contribution to the creation of internationalization and thus to boost research work in this area.

Since then, such international symposia took place every two years all over Europe. As the first conferences were a raving success, it was decided to go even further and the foundation of an organization was the logical consequence. This step was accomplished in 2003, when the International Association of Computer Science in Sport (IACSS) was established during the 4th international symposium in Barcelona, when Prof. Jürgen Perl was also chosen as the first president. A few years earlier, the first international e-journal on this topic (International Journal of Computer Science in Sport) was released already. The internationalization is confirmed moreover by the fact that three conferences already took place outside of Europe - in [[Calgary]] ([[Canada]]) in 2007, [[Canberra]] ([[Australia]]) in 2009 and [[Shanghai]] ([[China]]) in 2011. During the symposium in Calgary additionally the president position changed - it has been assigned to Prof. Arnold Baca, who has been re-elected in 2009 and 2011. The following Symposia on Computer Science in Sport took place in Europe again, in [[Istanbul]] ([[Turkey]]) in 2013 and in [[Loughborough]] ([[UK]]) in 2015. In 2017 the 11th Symposium of Computer Science in Sport took place in [[Constance]] ([[Germany]]). During the conference in Istanbul Prof. Martin Lames was elected as president of the IACSS. He was re-elected in 2015 and 2017.

=== National organizations ===
In addition to the international associations from above, currently the following national associations on computer science in sport exist (if available, the web addresses are also given):

* Austrian Association of Computer Science in Sport - http://www.sportinformatik.at
* British Association of Computer Science in Sport and Exercise

==Plunge freezing==
The method involves ultra-rapid cooling of small samples to the temperature of liquid [[nitrogen]] (−196&amp;nbsp;°C) or below, stopping all motion and metabolic activity and preserving the internal structure by freezing all fluid [[state of matter|phases]] solid. Typically, a sample is lowered into a liquid nitrogen container or into a liquid [[ethane]] or liquid [[propane]] container which is surrounded by liquid nitrogen. The ultimate objective is to freeze the specimen so rapidly (at 10&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; to 10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; K per second) that [[ice crystals]] are unable to form, or are prevented from growing big enough to cause damage to the specimen's [[ultrastructure]]. The formation of samples containing specimens in [[amorphous ice]] is the "[[holy grail]]" of biological cryomicroscopy.

In practice, it is very difficult to achieve high enough cooling rates to produce [[amorphous ice]] in specimens more than a few [[micrometres]] in thickness. For this purpose, plunging a specimen into liquid nitrogen at its boiling point (−196&amp;nbsp;°C)&lt;ref name=Battersby&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Battersby BJ, Sharp JC, Webb RI, Barnes GT|year=1994|title=Vitrification of aqueous suspensions from a controlled environment for electron microsocopy: an improved plunge-cooling device|journal=Journal of Microscopy |volume=176|issue=2|pages=110–120|doi=10.1111/j.1365-2818.1994.tb03505.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; does not always freeze the specimen fast enough, for several reasons. First, the liquid nitrogen boils rapidly around the specimen forming a film of insulating {{chem|N|2}} gas that slows heat transfer to the cryogenic liquid, known as the [[Leidenfrost effect]]. Cooling rates can be improved by pumping the liquid nitrogen with a [[rotary vane vacuum pump]] for a few dozen seconds before plunging the specimen into it. This lowers the temperature of the liquid nitrogen below its boiling point, so that when the specimen is plunged into it, it envelops the specimen closely for a brief period of time and extracts heat from it more efficiently. Even faster cooling can be obtained by plunging specimens into liquid [[propane]] or [[ethane]] (ethane has been found to be more efficient)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Ryan, Keith P. | title = Cryofixation of tissues for electron microscopy: a review of plunge cooling methods. | journal = Scan.

==High-pressure freezing==
High pressure helps prevent the formation of large ice crystals. Self pressurized rapid freezing (SPRF) can utilize many different cryogens has recently been touted as an attractive and low cost alternative to high pressure freezing (HPF).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Leunissen Jan L.M. and Yi H. | title = Self-pressurized rapid freezing (SPRF): a novel cryofixation method for specimen preparation in electron microscopy | journal = J.

DOPE is based on an improved reference state that corresponds to noninteracting atoms in a homogeneous sphere with the radius dependent on a sample native structure; it thus accounts for the finite and spherical shape of the native structures. It is implemented in the popular homology modeling program [[MODELLER]] and used to assess the [[Potential energy of protein|energy of the protein]] model generated through many iterations by MODELLER, which produces homology models by the satisfaction of spatial restraints. The models returning the minimum molpdfs can be chosen as best probable structures and can be further used for evaluating with the DOPE score. Like the current version of the MODELLER software, DOPE is implemented in [[Python (programming language)|Python]] and is run within the MODELLER environment. The DOPE method is generally used to assess the quality of a structure model as a whole. Alternatively, DOPE can also generate a residue-by-residue energy profile for the input model, making it possible for the user to spot the problematic region in the structure model.

'''''Fads and Fallacies in the Name of Science''''' (1957)—originally published in 1952 as '''''In the Name of Science: An Entertaining Survey of the High Priests and Cultists of Science, Past and Present'''''&lt;ref name="Shermer"/&gt;—was [[Martin Gardner]]'s second book.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Gardner|1957}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dover - the publisher of the book's second edition - had published a collection of mathematical puzzles the year before, and Gardner had already written many articles throughout the 1950s.&lt;/ref&gt; A survey of what it described as [[pseudoscience]]s and cult beliefs, it became a founding document in the nascent [[scientific skepticism]] movement. [[Michael Shermer]] said of it: "Modern skepticism has developed into a science-based movement, beginning with Martin Gardner's 1952 classic".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Shermer|first1=Michael|authorlink=Michael Shermer|title=Why People Believe Weird Things: Pseudoscience, Superstition, and Other Confusions of Our Time|date=2002|publisher=Henry Holt|location=New York|isbn=0-8050-7089-3|page=16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Fads and Fallacies in the Name of Science'' starts with a brief survey of the spread of the ideas of "cranks" and "pseudo-scientists", attacking the credulity of the popular press and the irresponsibility of publishing houses in helping to propagate these ideas. Cranks often cite historical cases where ideas were rejected which are now accepted as right. Gardner acknowledges that such cases occurred, and describes some of them, but says that times have changed: "If anything, scientific journals err on the side of permitting ''questionable'' theses to be published".  Gardner acknowledges that "among older scientists ... one may occasionally meet with irrational prejudice against a new point of view", but adds that "a certain degree of dogma ... is both necessary and desirable" because otherwise "science would be reduced to shambles by having to examine every new-fangled notion that came along."

Gardner says that cranks have ''two'' common characteristics. The first "and most important" is that they work in almost total isolation from the [[scientific community]]. Gardner defines the community as an efficient network of communication within scientific fields, together with a co-operative process of testing new theories. This process allows for apparently bizarre theories to be published — such as [[Albert Einstein|Einstein]]'s [[theory of relativity]], which initially met with considerable opposition; it was never dismissed as the work of a crackpot, and it soon met with almost universal acceptance.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Gardner|1957}} pp. 8-9&lt;/ref&gt; But the crank "stands entirely outside the closely integrated channels through which new ideas are introduced and evaluated. He does not send his findings to the recognized journals or, if he does, they are rejected for reasons which in the vast majority of cases are excellent."

The second characteristic of the crank (which also contributes to his or her isolation) is the tendency to paranoia. There are ''five'' ways in which this tendency is likely to be manifested.

#The pseudo-scientist considers himself a genius.
#He regards other researchers as stupid, dishonest or both.
#He believes there is a campaign against his ideas, a campaign comparable to the persecution of [[Galileo]] or [[Louis Pasteur|Pasteur]]. He may attribute his "persecution" to a conspiracy by a scientific "masonry" who are unwilling to admit anyone to their inner sanctum without appropriate initiation.
#Instead of side-stepping the mainstream, the pseudo-scientist attacks it head-on: The most revered scientist is [[Albert Einstein|Einstein]] so Gardner writes that Einstein is the most likely establishment figure to be attacked.
#He has a tendency to use complex jargon, often making up words and phrases. Gardner compares this to the way that schizophrenics talk in what psychiatrists call "neologisms", "words which have meaning to the patient, but sound like [[Jabberwocky]] to everyone else."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Gardner|1957}} pp 13-14&lt;/ref&gt;

These psychological traits are in varying degrees demonstrated throughout the remaining chapters of the book, in which Gardner examines particular "fads" he labels pseudo-scientific. His writing became the source book from which many later studies of pseudo-science were taken (e.g. ''Encyclopedia of Pseudo-science'').

==History==
The 1957 [[Dover Publications|Dover]] publication is a revised and expanded version of ''In the Name of Science'', which was published by [[G. P. Putnam's Sons]] in 1952.  The subtitle boldly states the book's theme: "The curious theories of modern pseudoscientists and the strange, amusing and alarming cults that surround them. A study in human gullibility". As of 2005, it had been reprinted at least 30 times.

The book was expanded from an article first published in the ''[[Antioch Review]]'' in 1950,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Gardner|1950}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in the preface to the first edition, Gardner thanks the Review for allowing him to develop the article as the starting point of his book.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Gardner|1957}} p. viii&lt;/ref&gt; Not all material in the article is carried over to the book. For example, in the article, Gardner writes:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
The reader may wonder why a competent scientist does not publish a detailed refutation of Reich's absurd biological speculations. The answer is that the informed scientist doesn't care, and would, in fact, damage his reputation by taking the time to undertake such a thankless task.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Gardner|1950}} p. 456&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

And comments in a footnote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
It is not within the scope of this paper, however, to discuss technical criteria by which hypotheses are given high, low, or negative degrees of confirmation. Our purpose is simply to glance at several examples of a type of scientific activity which fails completely to conform to scientific standards, but at the same time is the result of such intricate mental activity that it wins temporary acceptance by many laymen insufficiently informed to recognize the scientist's incompetence. Although there obviously is no sharp line separating competent from incompetent research, and there are occasions when a scientific "orthodoxy" may delay the acceptance of novel views, the fact remains that the distance between the work of competent scientists and the speculations of a Voliva or Velikovsky is so great that a qualitative difference emerges which justifies the label of "pseudo-science." Since the time of Galileo the history of pseudo-science has been so completely outside the history of science that the two streams touch only in the rarest of instances.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Gardner|1950}} p. 456, n.4&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

While in the book, Gardner writes:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
If someone announces that the moon is made of green cheese, the professional astronomer cannot be expected to climb down from his telescope and write a detailed refutation.  “A fairly complete textbook of physics would be only part of the answer to Velikovsky,” writes Prof. Laurence J. Lafleur, in his excellent article on “Cranks and Scientists” (''Scientific Monthly'', Nov., 1951), “and it is therefore not surprising that the scientist does not find the undertaking worth while.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Gardner|1957}} p. 11&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

And in the wrap-up of the chapter:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Just as an experienced doctor is able to diagnose certain ailments the instant a new patient walks into his office, or a police officer learns to recognize criminal types from subtle behavior clues which escape the untrained eye, so we, perhaps, may learn to recognize the future scientific crank when we first encounter him.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Gardner|1957}} p. 15&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Reception==
A contemporary review in the ''[[Pittsburgh Post-Gazette]]'' particularly welcomed Gardner's critical remarks about [[Hoxsey Therapy]] and about [[Krebiozen]], both of which were being advanced as anti-cancer measures at that time. The review concluded that the book "should help to counteract some amusing and some positively harmful cults, the existence of which is all too often promoted by irresponsible journalism."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=A Study of the Strange Growth of Pseudo-Science |author= |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=t3xIAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=0WoDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3392,2509292&amp;dq=in-the-name-of-science+gardner&amp;hl=en |newspaper=[[Pittsburgh Post-Gazette]] |date=November 16, 1957 |accessdate=February 14, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The work has often been mentioned in subsequent books and articles. [[Louis Lasagna]], in his book ''The Doctors' Dilemmas'', considered it to be a "superb account of scientific cults, fads, and frauds" and wrote that "This talented writer combines solid fact with a pleasing style."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The doctors' dilemmas |last=Lasagna |first=Louis |authorlink=Louis Lasagna |year=1970 |publisher=Ayer Publishing |location= |isbn= |page=292 |pages= |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CiLMdjrSFeEC&amp;pg=PA292&amp;dq=%22Fads+and+Fallacies+in+the+Name+of+Science%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=DvlYTaiSJYOUtwef9LyADQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=10&amp;ved=0CFYQ6AEwCTgK#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Fads%20and%20Fallacies%20in%20the%20Name%20of%20Science%22&amp;f=false |accessdate=February 14, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sociologist of religion [[Anson D. Shupe]] took in general a positive attitude, and praises Gardner for his humor. But he says&lt;blockquote&gt;
If there is a single criticism to be made of Gardner ... it is that he accepts too comfortably the conventional wisdom, or accepted social reality, of current twentieth-century science and middle-class American Christianity. Somehow it is evident (to me at least) that he is implicitly making a pact with the reader to evaluate these fringe groups in terms of their own shared presumptions about what is "normal". Thus he is quite confident throwing around labels like "quack", "crank" and "preposterous". In science the use of such value judgments can be quite time-bound; likewise in religions where today's heresy may become tomorrow's orthodoxy. The odds of course are always on the side of the writer criticizing fringe groups because statistically speaking so few of them survive. However, when a group does weather its infancy and go on to prosper, invariably its original detractors look a bit more arbitrary than they did initially, and then the shoe is on the other foot.&lt;ref name=shupe&gt;{{cite book |title=Six perspectives on new religions: a case study approach |last= Shupe |first=Anson D.|authorlink= Anson D. Shupe |year=1981 |isbn= 0-88946-333-6 |publisher=The Edwin Mellen Press  |page=50 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vhDcAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=%22Fads+and+Fallacies+in+the+Name+of+Science%22&amp;dq=%22Fads+and+Fallacies+in+the+Name+of+Science%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=DvlYTaiSJYOUtwef9LyADQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CDQQ6AEwAjgK }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In the 1980s a fierce interchange took place between Gardner and [[Colin Wilson]].  In ''The Quest for Wilhelm Reich'' Wilson wrote of this book&lt;blockquote&gt;(Gardner) writes about various kinds of cranks with the conscious superiority of the scientist, and in most cases one can share his sense of the victory of reason. But after half a dozen chapters this non-stop superiority begins to irritate; you begin to wonder about the standards that make him so certain ''he'' is always right. He asserts that the scientist, unlike the crank, does his best to remain open-minded. So how can he be so ''sure'' that no sane person has ever seen a flying saucer, or used a dowsing rod to locate water? And that all the people he disagrees with are unbalanced fanatics? A colleague of the positivist philosopher [[A. J. Ayer]] once remarked wryly "I wish I was as certain of anything as he seems to be about everything". Martin Gardner produces the same feeling.&lt;ref name=reichquest&gt;{{cite book| title=The Quest for Wilhelm Reich| first=Colin| last=Wilson| authorlink=Colin Wilson| year=1981| publisher=Granada Publishing|pages= 2–3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; By Wilson's own account, up to that time he and Gardner had been friends, but Gardner took offence.&lt;ref name=NYRJune&gt;[http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/1989/jun/15/ghosts-poltergeists/ letter, New York Review of Books, June 15, 1989]&lt;/ref&gt; In February 1989 Gardner wrote a letter published in ''[[The New York Review of Books]]'' describing Wilson as "England’s leading journalist of the occult, and a firm believer in ghosts, poltergeists, levitations, dowsing, PK (psychokinesis), ESP, and every other aspect of the psychic scene".&lt;ref name=NYRFeb&gt;[http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/1989/feb/16/paranormal-companionship/ letter, New York Review of Books, February 16, 1989]&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly afterwards, Wilson replied, defending himself and adding "What strikes me as so interesting is that when Mr. Gardner—and his colleagues of [[CSICOP]]—begin to denounce the 'Yahoos of the paranormal,' they manage to generate an atmosphere of such intense hysteria ...".&lt;ref name=NYRJune/&gt; Gardner in turn replied quoting his own earlier description of Wilson: "The former boy wonder, tall and handsome in his turtleneck sweater, has now decayed into one of those amiable eccentrics for which the land of Conan Doyle is noted. They prowl comically about the lunatic fringes of science ..."&lt;ref name=NYRJune/&gt;

In a review of a subsequent Gardner work, Paul Stuewe of the ''[[Toronto Star]]'' called ''Fads and Fallacies'' a "hugely enjoyable demolition of pseudo-scientific nonsense".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Politics and biography make strange bedfellows |author=Paul Stuewe |url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/thestar/access/471222021.html?FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;type=current&amp;date=Mar+17,+1990&amp;author=Paul+Stuewe&amp;pub=Toronto+Star&amp;desc=Politics+and+biography+make+strange+bedfellows&amp;pqatl=google |newspaper=[[Toronto Star]] |date=March 17, 1990 |accessdate=February 14, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ed Regis (author)|Ed Regis]], writing in ''[[The New York Times]]'', considered the book to be "the classic put-down of pseudoscience".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=There's One Born Every Minute |author=Ed Regis  |authorlink=Ed Regis (author)|url=https://www.nytimes.com/books/00/06/04/reviews/000604.04regist.html |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=June 4, 2000 |accessdate=February 14, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fellow skeptic [[Michael Shermer]] called the book "''the'' skeptic classic of the past half-century." He noted that the mark of popularity for the book came when [[John W. Campbell]] denounced the chapter on dianetics over the radio.&lt;ref name="Shermer"&gt;{{cite book |title=The borderlands of science: where sense meets nonsense |last=Shermer |first=Michael |authorlink=Michael Shermer|coauthors= |year=2001 |publisher=Oxford University Press US |location= |isbn= |page=50 |pages= |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KCanmmIb8QUC&amp;pg=PA50&amp;dq=%22Fads+and+Fallacies+in+the+Name+of+Science%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=HPNYTcOpEMK4tgf5hdWWDQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=5&amp;ved=0CEQQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Fads%20and%20Fallacies%20in%20the%20Name%20of%20Science%22&amp;f=false |accessdate=February 14, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mark Erickson, author of ''Science, culture and society: understanding science in the twenty-first century'', noted that Gardner's book provided "a flavour of the immense optimism surrounding science in the 1950s" and that his choice of topics were "interesting", but also that his attacks on "osteopathy, chiropractice, and the Bates method for correcting eyesight would raise eyebrows amongst medical practitioners today".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Science, culture and society: understanding science in the twenty-first century |last=Erickson |first=Mark |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=2005 |publisher=Polity |location= |isbn= |page= |pages=150–151 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-NgajQBd_6AC&amp;pg=PA150&amp;dq=%22Fads+and+Fallacies+in+the+Name+of+Science%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=BPtYTc27BIW4tweY54XVDA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=9&amp;ved=0CE8Q6AEwCDgU#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Fads%20and%20Fallacies%20in%20the%20Name%20of%20Science%22&amp;f=false |accessdate=February 14, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gardner’s own response to criticism is given in his preface:
:The first edition of this book prompted many curious letters from irate readers. The most violent letters came from Reichians, furious because the book considered orgonomy alongside such (to them) outlandish cults as dianetics. Dianeticians, of course, felt the same about orgonomy. I heard from homeopaths who were insulted to find themselves in company with such frauds as osteopathy and chiropractic, and one chiropractor in Kentucky “pitied” me because I had turned my spine on God’s greatest gift to suffering humanity. Several admirers of Dr. Bates favored me with letters so badly typed that I suspect the writers were in urgent need of strong spectacles. Oddly enough, most of these correspondents objected to one chapter only, thinking all the others excellent.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Gardner|1957}} preface&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3548">A '''fudge factor''' is an ''[[ad hoc]]'' quantity or element introduced into a [[calculation]], [[formula]] or [[Scientific modelling|model]] in order to make it fit observations or expectations.  Examples include Einstein's [[Cosmological Constant]], [[dark energy]], the initial proposals of [[dark matter]] and [[inflation (cosmology)|inflation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Einstein's Greatest Blunder?: The Cosmological Constant and Other Fudge Factors in the Physics of the Universe |author=Donald Goldsmith |publisher=Harvard University Press |year=1997 |isbn=9780674242425}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples in science==
Some quantities in scientific theory are set arbitrarily according to measured results rather than by calculation (for example, [[Planck's constant]]). However, in the case of these [[fundamental constants]], their arbitrariness is usually explicit. To suggest that other calculations may include a "fudge factor" may suggest that the calculation has been somehow tampered with to make results give a misleadingly good match to experimental data.

===Cosmological constant===
In theoretical physics, when [[Einstein]] originally tried to produce a [[general theory of relativity]], he found that the theory seemed to predict the gravitational collapse of the universe: it seemed that the universe should either be expanding or collapsing, and to produce a model in which the universe was ''static and stable'' (which seemed to Einstein at the time to be the "proper" result), he introduced an expansionist variable (called the [[Cosmological Constant]]), whose sole purpose was to cancel out the cumulative effects of gravitation. He later called this, "the biggest blunder of my life."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UM2agAdvbXkC&amp;pg=PA246 |title=The Quantum World: Quantum Physics for Everyone |author=Kenneth William Ford
 |publisher=Harvard University Press |year=2004 |isbn=9780674037144}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Expected error margins==
{{unreferenced|section|date=April 2014}}
A common feature of "fudge factors" in science is their arbitrariness, and their retrospective nature. 

However, in [[project management]] it's common to build a certain [[error margin]] into the ''predicted'' "resource cost" of a project to make predictions more realistic: there are many unforeseen factors that may delay a project or make it more costly, but very few factors that could result in it being delivered ''before'' time or ''under'' the calculated budget ... so to some degree, "unexpected" overruns are to be expected, even if their precise nature can't be predicted in advance. Experienced planners may know that a certain type of project will tend to overrun by a certain percentage of its calculated resource requirements, and may multiply the "ideal" calculations by a safety margin to produce a more realistic estimate, and this margin may sometimes be referred to as a fudge factor. 
However, when planning ahead for ''expected'' unpredictabilities, these "error margins" are usually assigned other, more specific names : for instance in warehouse stock control, where a certain amount of stock is expected to disappear naturally through damage, pilfering or other unexplained problems, the discrepancy is referred to as [[shrinkage (accounting)|shrinkage]].

In [[engineering]], a "fudge factor" may be introduced to allow a margin of error in unknown quantities.

{{Human history}}

The '''future''' is what will happen in the [[time]] after the [[present]].&lt;ref&gt;Simandan, D., 2018. Wisdom and foresight in Chinese thought: sensing the immediate future. Journal of Futures Studies. 22(3), pp. 35-50. https://doi.org/10.6531/JFS.2018.22(3).00A35
&lt;/ref&gt; Its arrival is considered inevitable due to the existence of [[time]] and the [[laws of physics]].  Due to the apparent nature of [[reality]] and the unavoidability of the future, everything that currently exists and will [[wikt:exist|exist]] can be categorized as either permanent, meaning that it will exist forever, or temporary, meaning that it will end.  &lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=UD8TAAAAYAAJ Encyclopædia of religion and ethics]. Edinburgh: T. &amp; T. Clark. Page 335–337.&lt;/ref&gt;  In the [[Western culture|Occidental]] view, which uses a linear conception of time, the future is the portion of the projected time line that is anticipated to occur.&lt;ref&gt;Moore, C.-L., &amp; Yamamoto, K. (1988). Beyond words: movement observation and analysis. New York: Gordon and Breach. Page 57. (cf., The representation of time as a linear, unidirectional progression is a distinctly Occidental point of view.)&lt;/ref&gt; In [[special relativity]], the future is considered [[absolute future]], or the future [[light cone]].&lt;ref&gt;Eddington, A. S. (1921). [https://books.google.com/books?id=uU1WAAAAMAAJ Space, time and gravitation; an outline of the general relativity theory]. Cambridge: University Press. Page 107.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[philosophy of time]], [[Philosophical presentism|presentism]] is the [[belief]] that only the present [[existence|exists]] and the future and the past are [[reality|unreal]]. Religions consider the future when they address issues such as [[karma]], [[afterlife|life after death]], and [[eschatology|eschatologies]] that study what the end of time and the end of the world will be. Religious figures such as [[prophet]]s and [[divination|diviners]] have claimed to see into the future. 
Future studies, or [[futurology]], is the science, art and practice of postulating possible futures. Modern practitioners stress the importance of alternative and plural futures, rather than one monolithic future, and the limitations of prediction and [[probability]], versus the creation of possible and preferable futures.

The concept of the future has been explored extensively in cultural production, including [[art]] movements and genres devoted entirely to its elucidation, such as the 20th century movement [[futurism]].

==Physics==
[[File:World line.svg|250px|right|thumb|A visualisation of the future [[light cone]] (at top), the present, and the past light cone in 2D space.]]
{{Seealso|Time in physics}}
In physics, time is a fourth dimension. Physicists argue that [[spacetime]] can be understood as a sort of stretchy fabric that bends due to forces such as gravity. In [[classical physics]] the future is just a half of the timeline, which is the same for all observers. In [[special relativity]] the flow of time is relative to the observer's [[frame of reference]]. The faster an observer is traveling away from a reference object, the slower that object seems to move through time. Hence, future is not an objective notion anymore. A more significant notion is [[absolute future]] or the future [[light cone]]. While a person can move backwards or forwards in the three spatial dimensions, many physicists argue you are only able to move forward in time.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.livescience.com/technology/070307_time_travel.html|title=You Can't Travel Back in Time, Scientists Say|publisher=|accessdate=31 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the outcomes of Special Relativity Theory is that a person can travel into the future (but never come back) by traveling at very high speeds. While this effect is negligible under ordinary conditions, space travel at very high speeds can change the flow of time considerably. As depicted in many [[science fiction]] stories and movies (e.g. ''[[Déjà Vu (2006 film)|Déjà Vu]]''), a person traveling for even a short time at near [[light speed]] will return to an Earth that is many years in the future.

Some physicists claim that by using a [[wormhole]] to connect two regions of spacetime a person could theoretically travel in time. Physicist [[Michio Kaku]] points out that to power this hypothetical time machine and "punch a hole into the fabric of space-time", it would require the energy of a star. Another theory is that a person could travel in time with [[cosmic string]]s.

==Philosophy==

In the [[philosophy of time]], presentism is the [[belief]] that only the present [[existence|exists]], and the future and [[past]] are [[reality|unreal]]. Past and future "entities" are construed as [[logic]]al constructions or [[fictionalism|fictions]]. The opposite of presentism is '[[Eternalism (philosophy of time)|eternalism]]', which is the belief that things in the past and things yet to come exist [[eternity|eternally]]. Another view (not held by many philosophers) is sometimes called the '[[Growing block universe|growing block]]' [[theory]] of time—which postulates that the past and present exist, but the future does not.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last=Broad| first= C.D.| title= Scientific Thought| location=New York| publisher=Harcourt, Brace and Co.| year=1923| url=http://www.ditext.com/broad/st/st-con.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Presentism is [[wikt:compatible|compatible]] with [[Galilean relativity]], in which time is independent of space, but is probably incompatible with [[Hendrik Lorentz|Lorentz]]ian/[[Einstein]]ian relativity in conjunction with certain other philosophical [[thesis|theses]] that many find uncontroversial. [[Augustine of Hippo|Saint Augustine]] [[Research proposal|proposed]] that the present is a knife edge between the past and the future and could not contain any extended period of time.

Contrary to Saint Augustine, some philosophers propose that conscious experience is extended in time.  For instance, [[William James]] said that time is "...the short duration of which we are immediately and incessantly sensible."{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}}  Augustine proposed that God is outside of time and present for all times, in [[eternity]]. Other early philosophers who were presentists include the [[Buddhism|Buddhists]] (in the tradition of [[Indian Buddhism]]). A leading scholar from the modern era on [[Buddhist philosophy]] is [[Theodor Ippolitovich Stcherbatsky|Stcherbatsky]], who has written extensively on Buddhist presentism: {{cquote|Everything past is unreal, everything future is unreal, everything imagined, absent, mental... is unreal... Ultimately real is only the present moment of physical [[wikt:efficiency|efficiency]] [i.e., [[Causality|causation]]].&lt;ref&gt;Vol.1 of ''Buddhist Logic'', 1962, Dover: New York. 70-71.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Psychology==
{{unreferenced section|date=October 2018}}
[[Human behavior]] is known to encompass anticipation of the future. Anticipatory behavior can be the result of a psychological outlook toward the future, for examples [[optimism]], [[pessimism]], and [[hope]].

Optimism is an outlook on life such that one maintains a view of the world as a positive place. People would say that optimism is seeing the glass "half full" of water as opposed to half empty. It is the philosophical opposite of pessimism. Optimists generally believe that people and events are inherently good, so that most situations work out in the end for the best. Hope is a belief in a positive outcome related to events and circumstances in one's life. Hope implies a certain amount of despair, wanting, wishing, suffering or perseverance — i.e., believing that a better or positive outcome is possible even when there is some evidence to the contrary. "Hopefulness" is somewhat different from optimism in that hope is an emotional state, whereas optimism is a conclusion reached through a deliberate thought pattern that leads to a positive attitude.

[[Pessimism]] as stated before is the opposite of optimism. It is the tendency to see, anticipate, or emphasize only bad or undesirable outcomes, results, or problems. The word originates in Latin from Pessimus meaning worst and Malus meaning bad.

==Religion==
Religions consider the future when they address issues such as [[karma]], [[afterlife|life after death]], and [[eschatology|eschatologies]] that study what the end of time and the end of the world will be. In religion, major prophets are said to have the power to change the future.  Common religious figures have claimed to see into the future, such as minor [[prophet]]s and [[divination|diviners]].
The term "afterlife" refers to the continuation of [[existence]] of the [[Soul (spirit)|soul]], [[spirit]] or [[mind]] of a human (or animal) after physical [[death]], typically in a [[Spirituality|spiritual]] or [[ghost]]like afterworld. Deceased persons are usually believed to go to a specific region or [[planes of existence|plane of existence]] in this afterworld, often depending on the rightness of their actions during life.

Some believe the afterlife includes some form of preparation for the [[Soul (spirit)|soul]] to transfer to another body ([[reincarnation]]).
The major views on the afterlife derive from [[religion]], [[esotericism]] and [[metaphysics]]. There are those who are skeptical of the existence of the afterlife, or believe that it is absolutely impossible, such as the [[materialism|materialist]]-reductionists, who believe that the topic is [[supernatural]], therefore does not really exist or is unknowable. In metaphysical models, [[theists]] generally believe some sort of afterlife awaits people when they die. [[Atheism|Atheists]] generally do not believe in a life after death. Members of some generally non-theistic religions such as [[Buddhism]], tend to believe in an afterlife like [[reincarnation]] but without reference to [[God]].

[[Agnosticism|Agnostics]] generally hold the position that like the existence of God, the existence of supernatural phenomena, such as souls or life after death, is unverifiable and therefore unknowable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/agnostic | title=agnositic | publisher=Merriam-Webster | accessdate=2 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many religions, whether they believe in the soul’s existence in another world like Christianity, Islam and many [[Paganism|pagan]] belief systems, or in reincarnation like many forms of Hinduism and Buddhism, believe that one’s status in the afterlife is a reward or punishment for their conduct during life, with the exception of [[Calvinistic]] variants of [[Protestant]] Christianity, which believes one's status in the afterlife is a gift from God and cannot be earned during life.

[[Eschatology]] is a part of [[theology]] and [[philosophy]] concerned with the final events in the [[history of the world]], or the ultimate [[destiny]] of [[All humanity|humanity]], commonly referred to as the end of the world. While in [[mysticism]] the phrase refers metaphorically to the end of ordinary reality and reunion with the Divine, in many traditional [[religion]]s it is taught as an actual future event [[prophecy|prophesied]] in [[sacred text]]s or [[folklore]]. More broadly, eschatology may encompass related concepts such as the [[Messiah]] or [[Messianic Age]], the [[end time]], and the [[End of Days (eschatology)|end of days]].

== Grammar ==
In [[Grammar]], actions are classified according to one of the following twelve verb tenses: past ([[past]], [[Uses of English verb forms#Past progressive|past continuous]], [[past perfect]], or [[past perfect continuous]]), present ([[present]], [[present continuous]], [[present perfect]], or [[present perfect continuous]]), or future (future, [[future continuous]], [[future perfect]], or [[future perfect continuous]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author1=(no author) |title=Verb tenses |url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/grammar/verb-tenses |website=English Oxford Living Dictionaries |publisher=Oxford University Press |accessdate=27 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The future tense refers to actions that haven’t yet happened, but which are due, expected, or likely to occur in the future.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author1=(no author) |title=Verb tenses |url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/grammar/verb-tenses |website=English Oxford Living Dictionaries |publisher=Oxford University Press |accessdate=27 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in the sentence, "She will walk home," the verb "will walk" is in the future tense because it refers to an action that is going to, or is likely to, happen at a point in time beyond the present.

Verbs in the future continuous tense indicate actions that will happen beyond the present and will continue for a period of time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author1=(no author) |title=Verb tenses |url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/grammar/verb-tenses |website=English Oxford Living Dictionaries |publisher=Oxford University Press |accessdate=27 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the sentence, "She will be walking home," the [[verb phrase]] "will be walking" is in the future continuous tense because the action described is not happening now, but will happen sometime afterwards and is expected to continue happening for some time. Verbs in the future perfect tense indicate actions that will be completed at a particular point in the future.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author1=Merriam-Webster |title=Present Perfect |url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/present%20perfect |website=Merriam-Webster.com |publisher=Merriam-Webster |accessdate=27 August 2018 |format=Web |date=n.d.}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the [[verb phrase]], "will have walked," in the sentence, "She will have walked home," is in the future perfect tense because it refers to an action that is completed as of a specific time in the future. Finally, verbs in the future perfect continuous tense combine the features of the perfect and continuous tenses, describing the future status of actions that have been happening continually from now or the past through to a particular time in the future.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author1=(no author) |title=Verb tenses |url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/grammar/verb-tenses |website=English Oxford Living Dictionaries |publisher=Oxford University Press |accessdate=27 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the sentence, "She will have been walking home," the verb phrase "will have been walking" is in the future perfect continuous tense because it refers to an action that the speaker anticipates will be finished in the future.

Another way to think of the various future tenses is that actions described by the future tense will be completed at an unspecified time in the future, actions described by the future continuous tense will keep happening in the future, actions described by the future perfect tense will be completed at a specific time in the future, and actions described by the future perfect continuous tense are expected to be continuing as of a specific time in the future.

== Linear and cyclic culture ==
The linear view of time (common in [[Western thought]]) draws a stronger distinction between past and future than does the more common [[cyclic time]] of cultures such as India, where past and future can coalesce much more readily.&lt;ref&gt;

==Future studies==
[[Image:Stanford Torus interior.jpg|thumb|right|Project of an orbital colony [[Stanford torus]], painted by Donald E. Davis]]
[[Future studies]] or futurology is the science, art and practice of postulating possible, probable, and preferable futures and the worldviews and myths that underlie them. Futures studies seeks to understand what is likely to continue, what is likely to change, and what is novel. Part of the discipline thus seeks a systematic and pattern-based understanding of past and present, and to determine the likelihood of future events and trends.  A key part of this process is understanding the potential future impact of decisions made by individuals, organisations and governments.  Leaders use results of such work to assist in decision-making.

{{cquote|Take hold of the future or the future will take hold of you.&lt;br&gt;{{mdash}}[[Patrick Dixon]], author of ''[[Futurewise (book)|Futurewise]]''}}
Futures is an interdisciplinary field, studying yesterday's and today's changes, and aggregating and analyzing both lay and professional strategies, and opinions with respect to tomorrow. It includes analyzing the sources, patterns, and causes of change and stability in the attempt to develop foresight and to map possible futures. Modern practitioners stress the importance of alternative and plural futures, rather than one monolithic future, and the limitations of prediction and probability, versus the creation of possible and preferable futures.

Three factors usually distinguish futures studies from the research conducted by other disciplines (although all disciplines overlap, to differing degrees). First, futures studies often examines not only possible but also probable, preferable, and "wild card" futures. Second, futures studies typically attempts to gain a holistic or systemic view based on insights from a range of different disciplines. Third, futures studies challenges and unpacks the assumptions behind dominant and contending views of the future. The future thus is not empty but fraught with hidden assumptions.

Futures studies does not generally include the work of economists who forecast movements of interest rates over the next business cycle, or of managers or investors with short-term time horizons. Most strategic planning, which develops operational plans for preferred futures with time horizons of one to three years, is also not considered futures. But plans and strategies with longer time horizons that specifically attempt to anticipate and be robust to possible future events, are part of a major subdiscipline of futures studies called strategic foresight.

The futures field also excludes those who make future predictions through professed supernatural means. At the same time, it does seek to understand the models such groups use and the interpretations they give to these models.

===Forecasting===
{{Main|Forecasting}}
Forecasting is the process of [[Estimation|estimating]] outcomes in uncontrolled situations. Forecasting is applied in many areas, such as [[weather forecasting]], [[earthquake prediction]], [[transport planning]], and [[labour market]] planning. Due to the element of the unknown, [[risk]] and [[uncertainty]] are central to forecasting.

Statistically based forecasting employs [[time series]] with [[cross-sectional data|cross-sectional]] or [[longitudinal study|longitudinal]] data. [[Econometric]] forecasting methods use the assumption that it is possible to identify the underlying factors that might influence the variable that is being forecast. If the causes are understood, projections of the influencing variables can be made and used in the forecast. Judgmental forecasting methods incorporate intuitive judgments, opinions and probability estimates, as in the case of the [[Delphi method]], [[scenario building]], and [[simulation]]s.

Prediction is similar to forecasting but is used more generally, for instance to also include baseless claims on the future. Organized efforts to [[prediction|predict]] the future began with practices like [[astrology]], [[haruspicy]], and [[augury]]. These are all considered to be [[pseudoscience]] today, evolving from the human desire to know the future in advance.

Modern efforts such as [[future studies]] attempt to predict technological and societal trends, while more ancient practices, such as weather forecasting, have benefited from [[Scientific modeling|scientific]] and [[causal model]]ling. Despite the development of [[cognition|cognitive]] instruments for the comprehension of future, the [[stochastic process|stochastic]] and [[Chaos theory|chaotic]] nature of many natural and social processes has made precise forecasting of the future elusive.

==In art and culture==

===Futurism===
&lt;!--"Wat Phra Dhammakaya#Layout of building complex" links here --&gt;
[[Futurism]] as an [[art movement]] originated in [[Italy]] at the beginning of the 20th century. It developed largely in [[Italy]] and in [[Russia]], although it also had adherents in other countries - in England and Portugal for example. The Futurists explored every medium of art, including [[painting]], [[sculpture]], [[poetry]], [[theatre]], [[music]], [[architecture]], and even [[gastronomy]]. Futurists had a passionate loathing of ideas from the past, especially political and artistic traditions. They also espoused a love of [[speed]], [[technology]], and [[violence]]. Futurists dubbed the love of the past ''[[passéisme]]''. The car, the plane, and the industrial town were all legendary for the Futurists, because they represented the technological triumph of people over [[nature]].  The ''[[Futurist Manifesto]]'' of 1909 declared: "We will glorify war—the world's only hygiene—militarism, patriotism, the destructive gesture of freedom-bringers, beautiful ideas worth dying for, and scorn for woman."&lt;ref name="futurmanifest"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.italianfuturism.org/manifestos/foundingmanifesto/|title=The Founding and Manifesto of Futurism|publisher=italianfuturism.org (Originally published on ''[[Le Figaro]]'', [[Paris]], February 20, 1909)}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Though it owed much of its character and some of its ideas to [[political radicalism|radical political movements]], it had little involvement in politics until the autumn of 1913.&lt;ref&gt;Martin, Marianne W., p.186&lt;/ref&gt;

Futurism in Classical Music arose during this same time period. Closely identified with the central Italian Futurist movement were brother composers [[Luigi Russolo]] (1885-1947) and [[Antonio Russolo]] (1877-1942), who used instruments known as ''[[intonarumori]]'' - essentially [[sound box|sound boxes]] used to create music out of noise. Luigi Russolo's futurist manifesto, "[[The Art of Noises]]", is considered one of the most important and influential texts in 20th century musical aesthetics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Warner|Cox|2004|p=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other examples of futurist music include [[Arthur Honegger]]'s "[[Pacific 231]]" (1923), which imitates the sound of a steam locomotive, [[Sergei Prokofiev|Prokofiev]]'s "[[Le pas d'acier (Prokofiev)|The Steel Step]]" (1926), [[Alexander Mosolov]]'s "[[Iron Foundry]]" (1927), and the experiments of [[Edgard Varèse]].

[[Futurism (literature)| Literary futurism]] made its debut with [[Filippo Tommaso Marinetti|F.T. Marinetti]]'s ''[[Futurist Manifesto|Manifesto of Futurism]]'' (1909). Futurist poetry used unexpected combinations of images and hyper-conciseness (not to be confused with the actual length of the poem). Futurist theater works have scenes a few sentences long, use nonsensical humor, and try to discredit the deep-rooted dramatic traditions with parody. Longer literature forms, such as novels, had no place in the Futurist aesthetic, which had an obsession with speed and compression.

Futurism expanded to encompass other artistic domains and ultimately included painting, sculpture, ceramics, [[graphic design]], industrial design, interior design, theatre design, textiles, drama, literature, music and architecture. In architecture, it featured a distinctive thrust towards [[rationalism]] and [[modernism]] through the use of [[advanced building materials]]. The ideals of futurism remain as significant components of modern [[Western culture]]; the emphasis on youth, speed, power and technology finding expression in much of modern commercial [[film|cinema]] and [[commercial culture]]. Futurism has produced several reactions, including the 1980s-era literary genre of [[cyberpunk]] — which often treated technology with a critical eye.

===Science fiction===
[[File:Sortie de l'opéra en l'an 2000-2.jpg|thumb|right|240px|Print (c. 1902) by [[Albert Robida]] showing a futuristic view of air travel over Paris in the year 2000 as people leave the opera.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Science Fiction: Its Nature, Faults and Virtues |booktitle= The Science Fiction Novel: Imagination and Social Criticism |publisher= Advent Publishers |last= Heinlein |first= Robert A. |first2=Cyril |last2=Kornbluth |first3=Alfred |last3=Bester |first4=Robert |last4=Bloch |year= 1959 |location= University of Chicago}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
More generally, one can regard [[science fiction]] as a broad genre of [[fiction]] that often involves speculations based on current or future [[science]] or [[technology]]. Science fiction is found in books, art, television, films, games, theater, and other media. Science fiction differs from [[Fantasy literature|fantasy]] in that, within the context of the story, its imaginary elements are largely possible within scientifically established or scientifically postulated laws of nature (though ''some'' elements in a story might still be pure imaginative speculation). Settings may include the future, or alternative time-lines, and stories may depict new or speculative scientific principles (such as [[time travel]] or [[psionics]]), or new technology (such as [[nanotechnology]], [[faster-than-light]] travel or [[robot]]s). Exploring the consequences of such differences is the traditional purpose of science fiction, making it a "literature of ideas".&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

Some [[science fiction]] authors construct a postulated [[history]] of the future called a "[[future history]]" that provides a common background for their fiction. Sometimes authors publish a [[Chronology|timeline]] of events in their history, while other times the reader can reconstruct the order of the stories from information in the books. Some published works constitute "future history" in a more literal sense—i.e., stories or whole books written in the style of a history book but describing events in the future. Examples include [[H.G. Wells]]' ''[[The Shape of Things to Come]]'' (1933) - written in the form of a history book published in the year 2106 and in the manner of a real history book with numerous footnotes and references to the works of (mostly fictitious) prominent historians of the 20th and 21st centuries.

'''Joseph Blain Hanson''' (born February 23, 1983) is a writer and comedian living in [[Los Angeles]]. He is best known for his work on ''Current TV'', ''Smash Cuts'' and ''Joe Goes''.

Hanson made his first TV appearance in 2005, in the first season of the show ''[[The Beauty and the Geek]]''. Joe and his partner Erica were eliminated in the second episode.

In 2005, Hanson and his production partner Hassan S. Ali created the Joe Gets series for [[Current TV]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.current.com/joegets|accessdate=January 28, 2009|title=Joe Gets...|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110811010543/http://current.com/groups/joe-gets/|archivedate=August 11, 2011|publisher=current.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; which spanned 50 episodes and was sponsored by [[T-Mobile]]. The series involved Joe exploring fish-out-of-water situations, like entering trips to [[California]], [[Indiana]], [[Nevada]], [[Missouri]], [[South Dakota]], [[Alabama]] and [[New York (state)|New York]]. Joe also made the satirical series What's Wrong With,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://current.com/topics/76772342/what_s_wrong_with/new/0.htm|title=What's Wrong With...|accessdate=January 28, 2009|publisher=current.com|archivedate=June 12, 2012|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120612013342/http://current.com/groups/whats-wrong-with/new/}}&lt;/ref&gt; the music video [[parody]] Viral Superstar,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1514267/|title=Viral Superstar|publisher=[[IMDb]]|accessdate=November 3, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and interviewed [[celebrities]] at [[Elton John]]'s Oscars Afterparty, including [[George Lucas]], [[Eddie Van Halen]], [[Prince (musician)|Prince]], [[Carmen Electra]], [[Carson Daly]], [[John Waters (filmmaker)|John Waters]], [[Salma Hayek]] and [[Rick Fox]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://current.com/items/88024371/joe_meets_celebrities.htm|title=Joe Meets Celebrities|accessdate=January 28, 2009|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120612013350/http://current.com/entertainment/comedy/88024371_joe-meets-celebrities.htm|archivedate=June 12, 2012|date=November 29, 2007|publisher=current.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, Hanson started "Bino White Weekly," in which he made a rap song every week as Bino White. The topics ranged from Nintendo to Twitter to Science, and each track was accompanied by a YouTube video.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/user/binowhite |title=BinoWhite |publisher=YouTube |date= |accessdate=October 14, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He did this for 54 weeks, breaking [[Crooked I]]'s record for weekly rap songs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.binowhite.com/search/label/Bino%20White%20Weekly |title=Bino White Weekly |publisher=binowhite.com |date= |accessdate=October 14, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, he joined the cast of ''Smash Cuts'', a syndicated clip show on The CW and CBS affiliates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smashcutstv.com/cast |title=Cast Biography |publisher=[[CBS Television Distribution]]|archivedate= October 18, 2009|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091018093746/http://smashcutstv.com/cast|accessdate=October 14, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, Hanson started the Web series "[https://www.youtube.com/badgeofshame Joe Goes,"] in which he visits conventions, events and countries, to have funny interactions with people. The episode "Joe Goes To Exxxotica Expo" went viral, making the front page of the Huffington Post,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/08/31/porn-star-interviews_n_700743.html |title=Hilarious Interviews With Porn Stars At The 'Exxxotica Expo' (NSFW VIDEO) |publisher=Huffingtonpost.com |date=2010-08-31 |accessdate=2013-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; and getting over 550,000 views combined on YouTube&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVgzh2r5rI0 |title=Joe Goes To Exxxotica Expo |publisher=YouTube |date=2010-07-26 |accessdate=2013-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Funny Or Die.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.funnyordie.com/videos/24a0f55d5b/joe-goes-to-exxxotica-expo ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110519000214/http://www.funnyordie.com/videos/24a0f55d5b/joe-goes-to-exxxotica-expo |date=May 19, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other episodes have included visits to [[Anime Expo]], [[Amsterdam]], [[London]], [[Bangkok]], [[Finland]] and the press junket for [[Tron: Legacy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/badgeofshame |title=BadgeofShame |publisher=YouTube |date= |accessdate=2013-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hanson is a graduate of the [[University of Chicago]] and grew up in [[Fosston]], [[Minnesota]].

He also appeared in March 2012 in the music video for the song by Julian Smith on YouTube "[[Eat Randy]]" featuring as 'Randy'. The video has gained over seven million views to date.

He is mentioned as a writer for [[Ray William Johnson]]'s '[[Equals three|Equals Three]]'.

On October 5th 2017, Joe announced that would be going on an indefinite [[Hiatus (television)|hiatus]] from his youtube series, from which he hasn't yet returned.

==Early life and development==
Born in [[Castrovirreyna Province|Ticrapo, Castrovirreyna Province, Peru]],&lt;ref name="Telegraph"&gt;{{cite news|title=Six decades later, world's youngest mother awaits aid |url=http://www.telegraphindia.com/1020827/asp/foreign/story_1140311.asp |work=[[The Telegraph (Kolkata)|The Telegraph]] |date=27 August 2002 |accessdate=14 July 2009 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5iJ65vfQ8?url=http://www.telegraphindia.com/1020827/asp/foreign/story_1140311.asp |archivedate=16 July 2009 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; to [[silversmith]] Tiburelo Medina and Victoria Losea,&lt;ref name="await"&gt;Elgar Brown (for ''Chicago Evening American''). "American scientists await U.S. visit of youngest mother: Peruvian girl and baby will be exhibited", ''San Antonio Light'', 11 July 1939, page 2A.&lt;/ref&gt; she was brought to a hospital by her parents at the age of five years due to increasing abdominal size. She was originally thought to have a [[tumor]], but doctors determined she was in her seventh month of [[pregnancy]]. Dr Gerardo Lozada took Medina to [[Lima]] to have other specialists confirm that she was pregnant.&lt;ref name="Snopes"&gt;{{cite web |first=David |last=Mikkleson |title=Youngest Mother|publisher=Snopes.com|accessdate=25 January 2017 |url=http://www.snopes.com/pregnant/medina.asp |date=7 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Contemporary newspaper accounts indicate that interest in the case developed on many fronts. The ''San Antonio Light'' newspaper reported in its 16 July, 1939, edition&amp;mdash;in anticipation of the girl's expected visit to U.S. university scientific facilities&amp;mdash;that a national Peruvian obstetrician/midwife association had demanded that the girl be transported to a national maternity hospital; the paper quoted 18 April reports in the Peruvian paper ''La Crónica'' stating that a North American film making concern had sent a representative "with authority to offer the sum of $5,000 to benefit the minor [in exchange for filming rights] ... we know that the offer was rejected."&lt;ref name="sympathy"&gt;Elgar Brown (for ''Chicago Evening American''). "Wide sympathy aroused by plight of child-mother: opportunity seen to make Lina independent," ''San Antonio Light'', 16 July 1939, page 4.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The same article, reprinted from a Chicago paper, noted that Lozada had made films of Medina for scientific documentation and had shown them around 21 April while addressing Peru's National Academy of Medicine; on a subsequent visit to Lina's remote hometown, some of the baggage carrying the films had fallen into the river while crossing "a very primitive bridge ... Enough of his pictorial record remained, however, to intrigue the learned savants."&lt;ref name="sympathy"/&gt;

A month and a half after the original diagnosis, Medina gave birth by [[caesarean section]] to a boy. She was 5 years, 7 months, and 21 days,&lt;ref name=Snopes/&gt; [[List of youngest birth mothers|the youngest known person in history to give birth]]. The caesarean birth was necessitated by her small [[human pelvis|pelvis]]. The surgery was performed by Lozada and Dr Busalleu, with Dr Colareta providing [[anaesthesia]]. When doctors performed the caesarean to deliver her baby, they found she already had fully mature sexual organs from [[precocious puberty]].&lt;ref name="Telegraph"/&gt; Her case was reported in detail by Dr. Edmundo Escomel in the medical journal ''La Presse Médicale'', including the additional details that her [[menarche]] had occurred at eight months of age, in contrast to a past report stating that she had been having regular periods since she was three years old&lt;ref name="Snopes"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Curse: A Cultural History of Menstruation|year=1988|author1=Janice Delaney|author2=Mary Jane Lupton|author3=Emily Toth|isbn=0252014529|page=51|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=njfQfrMr31EC&amp;q=Lina+Medina#v=snippet&amp;q=Lina%20Medina&amp;f=false|edition=2nd (revised)|publisher=University of Illinois Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Shearman"&gt;{{cite book|author=Rodney P.

The striking example is that of Lina Medina, who had a Caesarean section when 5 ½ years old, but there have been other pregnancies in children aged 6, 7, 8 and 9 years (Sickel, 1946).}}&lt;/ref&gt; (or 2½ according to a different article).&lt;ref name="Telegraph"/&gt; 

Medina's son weighed {{convert|2.7|kg|lb st|abbr=on}} at birth and was named Gerardo after her doctor. Gerardo was raised believing that Medina was his sister, but found out at the age of 10 that she was, in fact, his mother.&lt;ref name="Snopes"/&gt;

==Identity of the father and later life==
Medina has never revealed the father of the child nor the circumstances of her impregnation. Escomel suggested she might not actually know herself by writing that Medina "couldn't give precise responses".&lt;ref name="Snopes"/&gt; Although Lina's father was arrested on suspicion of [[child sexual abuse]], he was later released due to lack of evidence, and the biological father was never identified.&lt;ref name="Snopes"/&gt;&lt;ref name="littlemother"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,893791,00.html |publisher=''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' |title=Little Mother |date=16 December 1957 |accessdate=16 November 2011 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5iJ7D1EHq?url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0%2C9171%2C893791%2C00.html |archivedate=16 July 2009 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Her son grew up healthy. He died in 1979 at the age of 40.&lt;ref name="Snopes"/&gt;

In young adulthood, Medina worked as a secretary in the Lima clinic of Lozada, who gave her an education and helped put her son through high school.&lt;ref name="leon"/&gt; Medina later married Raúl Jurado, who fathered her second son in 1972. {{As of|2002}}, they lived in a poor district of Lima known as "Chicago Chico".&lt;ref name="Dietz1998"&gt;{{cite book|author=Henry Dietz|title=Urban Poverty, Political Participation, and the State: Lima, 1970–1990|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Qf0NQ3Eut2IC&amp;pg=PA83&amp;dq=lima+chicago+chico|date=15 July 1998|publisher=University of Pittsburgh Press|isbn=978-0-8229-7193-1|page=83}}&lt;/ref&gt; She refused an interview with [[Reuters]] that year,&lt;ref name="Telegraph"/&gt; just as she had turned away many reporters in years past.&lt;ref name="leon"/&gt;

Although it was speculated that the case was a [[hoax]], a number of doctors over the years have verified it based on [[biopsies]], [[X rays]] of the fetal skeleton ''[[in utero]]'', and photographs taken by the doctors caring for her.&lt;ref name="Snopes"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Medico-Physical"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Journal of Medical-physical Research: A Journal of Progressive Medicine and Physical Therapies, Volumes 15-16|year=1941|publisher=American Association for Medico-Physical Research|page=188|quote=Lina Medina... Dear Dr. Eales: 'We are pleased to give you permission to publish the story of Lina Medina' ...  An x-ray examination revealed a foetal skeleton and left no doubt as to a positive uterine gestation.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Montagu"&gt;{{cite book|author=Ashley Montagu|title=The reproductive development of the female: a study in the comparative physiology of the adolescent organism|year=1979|publisher=PSG Publishing Company|isbn=0884162184|page=137}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

There are two published photographs documenting the case. The first was taken around the beginning of April 1939, when Medina was seven-and-a-half months into pregnancy. Taken from Medina's left side, it shows her standing naked in front of a neutral backdrop. This is the only published photograph of Lina taken during her pregnancy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biusante.parisdescartes.fr/histoire/medica/resultats/?cote=100000x1939xartorig&amp;p=878&amp;do=page "La Presse médicale",  47(43): 875, 1939] "La Plus Jeune Mère du Monde".  (31 May 1939).&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1955, except for the effects of precocious puberty,&lt;ref name="Telegraph"/&gt; there was no explanation of how a five-year-old girl could conceive a child.&lt;ref name="leon"&gt;{{cite news|author=Luis Leon|agency= Associated Press|url=https://newspaperarchive.com/us/iowa/cedar-rapids/cedar-rapids-gazette/1955/10-30/page-18|title=Son of child mother wants to be doctor|work=Cedar Rapids Gazette|date=30 October 1955|page=18|via=[[NewspaperArchive.com]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Extreme precocious pregnancy in children aged five or under has only been documented with Medina.&lt;ref name="Telegraph"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Shearman"/&gt;

A '''SCSI message code''' is a computer term which defines how [[SCSI]] devices send interface management information.  The message code comprises one or more bytes.

==List of message formats==
The first byte of the message determines the format:

==Central national statistical services==
Nearly every country in the world has set a central public sector unit entirely devoted to the production, harmonisation and dissemination of [[official statistics]] that the public sector and the national community need to run, monitor and evaluate their operations and policies. This central statistical organisation does not produce every official statistic as other public sector organisations, like the national [[central bank]] or [[government ministry|ministries]] in charge of agriculture, education or health, may be charged with producing and disseminating sector policy oriented statistical data. The statistical [[legislation]] and regulation generally attribute responsibilities and authorities according to statistical domains or functions in addition to those of the central unit.

The table below lists these central statistical organisations by country. The [[United States]] has no central producing unit, but several units (also listed below) have been given responsibility over various federal statistics domains (see also: [[Federal Statistical System of the United States]]).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1529">In mathematics, and more particularly in [[order theory]], several different types of '''ordered set''' have been studied.
They include:
* [[Cyclic order]]s, orderings in which triples of elements are either clockwise or counterclockwise
* [[Lattice (order)|Lattices]], partial orders in which each pair of elements has a greatest lower bound and a least upper bound. Many different types of lattice have been studied; see [[map of lattices]] for a list.
* [[Partially ordered set]]s (or ''posets''), orderings in which some pairs are comparable and others might not be
* [[Preorder]]s, a generalization of partial orders allowing ties (represented as equivalences and distinct from incomparabilities)
* [[Semiorder]]s, partial orders determined by comparison of numerical values, in which values that are too close to each other are incomparable; a subfamily of partial orders with certain restrictions
* [[Total order]]s, orderings that specify, for every two distinct elements, which one is less than the other
* [[Weak order]]s, generalizations of total orders allowing ties (represented either as equivalences or, in strict weak orders, as transitive incomparabilities)
* [[Well-order]]s, total orders in which every non-empty subset has a least element
* [[Well-quasi-ordering]]s, a class of preorders generalizing the well-orders

Zoos are primarily terrestrial facilities where animals are held in enclosures and displayed to the public for education and entertainment. Animals may be bred, as well, to maintain captive populations and kept under veterinary care. These facilities include [[zoo]]s, [[safari park]]s, [[animal theme park]]s, [[aviary|aviaries]], [[butterfly zoo]]s, [[herpetarium|reptile centers]], and [[petting zoo]]s, as well as [[wildlife sanctuary|wildlife sanctuaries]] and [[nature reserve]]s where visitors are allowed. Zoos in the United States show great diversity in both size and collection. Many are notable for ongoing global wildlife conservation and captive breeding efforts, especially for endangered animal species.

==History==
The Lost Ladybug Project was founded in 2000 when researchers from [[Cornell University]] worked with the [[4-H]] Master Gardener program to survey [[ladybug]] populations across [[New York (state)|New York]]. With the discovery of a rare [[Coccinella novemnotata|nine-spotted ladybug]] in 2006, the Lost Ladybug Project developed research methods and a database to log ladybug observations.&lt;ref name="lostladybug2013"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/07/26/AR2010072605500.html |title = Lost Ladybug Project helps scientists understand insect’s decline |last1 = McLaughlin |first1 = Moira |date = 27 July 2010 |work = The Washington Post|publisher = |accessdate = 19 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Granted funding from the [[National Science Foundation]] in 2008, the Lost Ladybug Project has counted over 34,000 ladybugs&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.mnn.com/your-home/organic-farming-gardening/stories/you-can-help-save-ladybugs|title=Where have all the ladybugs gone?|newspaper=Mother Nature Network|access-date=14 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; since its inception and is now a nationwide project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = https://www.nsf.gov/discoveries/disc_summ.jsp?cntn_id=116926&amp;org=NSF |title = Lost Ladybugs Found Again in South Dakota |author = &lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date = 21 May 2010 |work = |publisher = National Science Foundation |accessdate = 19 March 2013}}&lt;br&gt;-

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5311">'''Milena Penkowa''' (born 1973) is a Danish [[Neuroscience|neuroscientist]] who was a Professor at the [[Panum Institute]] at the [[University of Copenhagen]] from 2009&amp;ndash;2010. In 2010 she was convicted of [[fraud]] and [[embezzlement]] of funds from The Danish Society of Neuroscience. In the same year, she was also suspended by the University of Copenhagen and consequently resigned her professorship.&lt;ref name="Nature"/&gt; In 2012, the [[Danish Committees on Scientific Dishonesty]] concluded that she had been guilty of [[scientific misconduct]]. 

==Biography==
Penkowa has Danish-Bulgarian roots. In 1989 she participated in the European Championships for [[show jumping]] in [[Millstreet, Ireland]].&lt;ref name="Krige kan også føre til noget godt"&gt;{{Cite news | author = [[Mette-Line Thorup]]| title = Krige kan også føre til noget godt| url = http://www.information.dk/195788| publisher = [[Dagbladet Information]]| date = 25 June 2009|accessdate=16 October 2011 | language = Danish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She graduated from [[Kalundborg Gymnasium]] in 1991 and went on to study at the University of Copenhagen soon afterwards. Already in 1993 she was featured in a yearbook from the University for research. Again in 1994 her name was credited in an article on metal-binding proteins. She became assistant professor at the University of Copenhagen in 2000 and associate professor in 2002. In 2001 she published, along with her Spanish partner, Juan Hidalgo Pareja and two others, articles on [[metallothionein]]-containing [[liposome]]s which were published in May 2003. Her prolific research at [[Panum Institute]] at the University of Copenhagen from 2009&amp;ndash;2010 mainly concerned the protein metallothionein. She received the Danish Elite Research prize in 2009.

In 2010 she was accused of [[scientific misconduct]], as her graduate students were unable to replicate her previous results. Doubts arose about whether Penkowa had in fact carried out the experiments that she had reported.&lt;ref name="Nature"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nature.com/news/2011/110107/full/news.2011.703.html |title=Fraud investigation rocks Danish university|work= [[Nature (journal)|Nature]]|date=7 January 2011 |accessdate=16 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Penkowa was suspended from her professorship and research articles that she had authored were retracted from several journals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://retractionwatch.wordpress.com/category/by-author/milena-penkowa-retractions/|title= Retractions by Milena Penkowa |publisher= [[RetractionWatch]]|accessdate=16 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the investigation, accusations of having misspent part of a 5.6 million [[Danish krone|kroner]] research grant were also leveled against her, and the University of Copenhagen paid back 2 million kroner to the donor.&lt;ref name="Nature"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://universitypost.dk/taxonomy/term/809|title=All Milena Penkowa|work=UniversityPost|accessdate=26 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fifty-eight Danish researchers signed a letter requesting an open review of Penkowa's research, citing suspicions about data fabrication going back to her [[doctoral thesis]] in 2002.&lt;ref name="Nature"/&gt; Penkowa herself denied any wrongdoing,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://universitypost.dk/article/milena-penkowa-fights-back-media-interview|title=Milena Penkowa fights back in media interview|publisher=''UniversityPost''|accessdate=26 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; but resigned her professorship in December 2010.&lt;ref name="Nature"/&gt; 

In August 2012 an international panel of 5 researchers who had been carrying out an investigation of Penkowa's research for The University of Copenhagen concluded that there is "no doubt that there is justified suspicion of deliberate scientific malpractice in 15 of Penkowa’s articles." The University of Copenhagen have passed on the 15 articles for evaluation by the Danish Committees for Scientific Dishonesty, which will determine whether Penkowa's academic degrees should be declared invalid. Penkowa responded: "No-one is perfect, not even me, and there is no doubt that unforeseen errors could have been committed since I started working in a laboratory in 1993 and for that I apologise deeply. 'Deliberate malpractice' is another matter and something I have never done. I therefore do not think it is reasonable to infer that my research has been fraudulent as the press is doing these days."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cphpost.dk/news/national/controversial-neuroscientist-faces-fresh-fraud-allegations Copenhagen Post.

{{Electronic structure methods}}

In [[chemistry]], '''molecular orbital''' ('''MO''') '''theory''' is a [[chemical bonding model|method]] for describing the electronic structure of molecules.  [[Electron]]s are not assigned to individual [[chemical bond|bond]]s between [[atom]]s, but are treated as moving under the influence of the [[Atomic nucleus|nuclei]] in the whole molecule.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Daintith, J. |title=Oxford Dictionary of Chemistry|location=New York | publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2004|isbn=0-19-860918-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The spatial and energetic properties of electrons are described by [[quantum mechanics]] as [[atomic orbital|atomic]] or [[molecular orbital]]s that contain these electrons. While atomic orbitals contain electrons ascribed to a single atom, molecular orbitals surround two or more atoms in a molecule and contain [[valence electron]]s between atoms. Molecular orbital theory, which was proposed in the early twentieth century, revolutionized the study of bonding by approximating the states of bonded electrons—the molecular orbitals—as linear combinations of atomic orbitals ([[LCAO]]). These approximations are now made by applying the [[density functional theory]] (DFT) or [[Hartree–Fock method|Hartree–Fock]] (HF) models to the Schrödinger equation.

==Linear combination of atomic orbitals (LCAO) method ==
In the [[LCAO]] method, each molecule has a set of [[molecular orbital]]s. It is assumed that the molecular orbital [[wave function]] ''ψ&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;'' can be written as a simple weighted sum of the ''n'' constituent [[atomic orbital]]s ''χ&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'', according to the following equation:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Licker, Mark, J. |title=McGraw-Hill Concise Encyclopedia of Chemistry|location=New York | publisher=McGraw-Hill|year=2004|isbn=0-07-143953-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \psi_j = \sum_{i=1}^{n} c_{ij} \chi_i.&lt;/math&gt;

One may determine ''c&lt;sub&gt;ij&lt;/sub&gt;'' coefficients numerically by substituting this equation into the [[Schrödinger equation]] and applying the [[variational principle]]. The variational principle is a mathematical technique used in quantum mechanics to build up the coefficients of each atomic orbital basis. A larger coefficient means that the orbital basis is composed more of that particular contributing atomic orbital—hence, the molecular orbital is best characterized by that type. This method of quantifying orbital contribution as a [[linear combination of atomic orbitals]] is used in [[computational chemistry]]. An additional [[unitary transformation]] can be applied on the system to accelerate the convergence in some computational schemes. Molecular orbital theory was seen as a competitor to [[valence bond theory]] in the 1930s, before it was realized that the two methods are closely related and that when extended they become equivalent.

==History==
Molecular orbital theory was developed, in the years after [[valence bond theory]] had been established (1927), primarily through the efforts of [[Friedrich Hund]], [[Robert Mulliken]], [[John C. Slater]], and [[John Lennard-Jones]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Coulson | first = Charles, A. | title = Valence | publisher = Oxford at the Clarendon Press | year = 1952}}&lt;/ref&gt; MO theory was originally called the Hund-Mulliken theory.&lt;ref name="Mulliken" &gt;{{cite press release |url=http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/1966/mulliken-lecture.pdf |origyear=1966 |year=1972 |format=pdf |author=Mulliken, Robert S.|title=Spectroscopy, Molecular Orbitals, and Chemical Bonding |series=Nobel Lectures, Chemistry 1963–1970 |publisher=Elsevier Publishing Company |location=Amsterdam}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to German physicist and physical chemist [[Erich Hückel]], the first quantitative use of molecular orbital theory was the 1929 paper of [[John Lennard-Jones|Lennard-Jones]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Hückel |first=Erich |year=1934 |journal=Trans. Faraday Soc. |volume=30 |doi=10.1039/TF9343000040 |title=Theory of free radicals of organic chemistry |pages=40–52}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Lennard-Jones |first=J.E. |year=1929 |journal=Trans. Faraday Soc. |volume=25 |doi= 10.1039/TF9292500668 |title=The electronic structure of some diatomic molecules |pages=668–686}}&lt;/ref&gt; This paper notably predicted a [[triplet state|triplet]] ground state for the [[dioxygen molecule]] which explained its [[paramagnetism]]&lt;ref&gt;Coulson, C.A. ''Valence'' (2nd ed., Oxford University Press 1961), p.103&lt;/ref&gt; (see [[Molecular orbital diagram#Dioxygen]]) before valence bond theory, which came up with its own explanation in 1931.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Pauling |first=Linus |year=1931 |journal=J. Am. Chem. Soc. |volume=53 |doi= 10.1021/ja01360a004 |title= The Nature of the Chemical Bond. II. The One-Electron Bond and the Three-Electron Bond. |pages=3225–3237}}&lt;/ref&gt; The word ''orbital'' was introduced by Mulliken in 1932.&lt;ref name="Mulliken" /&gt; By 1933, the molecular orbital theory had been accepted as a valid and useful theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.quantum-chemistry-history.com/LeJo_Dat/LJ-Hall1.htm Lennard-Jones Paper of 1929 |title=Foundations of Molecular Orbital Theory. |first=George G |last=Hall |journal=Advances in Quantum Chemistry |volume=22 |issn=0065-3276 |ISBN=978-0-12-034822-0 |doi=10.1016/S0065-3276(08)60361-5|bibcode = 1991AdQC...22....1H }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Erich Hückel applied molecular orbital theory to unsaturated hydrocarbon molecules starting in 1931 with his [[Hückel method|Hückel molecular orbital (HMO) method]] for the determination of MO energies for [[pi electrons]], which he applied to conjugated and aromatic hydrocarbons.&lt;ref&gt;E. Hückel, ''[[Zeitschrift für Physik]]'', '''70''', 204 (1931); '''72''', 310 (1931); '''76''', 628 (1932); '''83''', 632 (1933).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Hückel Theory for Organic Chemists'', [[Charles A. Coulson|C. A. Coulson]], B. O'Leary and R. B. Mallion, Academic Press, 1978.&lt;/ref&gt; This method provided an explanation of the stability of molecules with six pi-electrons such as [[benzene]].

The first accurate calculation of a molecular orbital wavefunction was that made by [[Charles Coulson]] in 1938 on the hydrogen molecule.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Coulson |first=C.A. |author-link=Charles_Coulson |title=Self-consistent field for molecular hydrogen |journal=Mathematical Proceedings of the Cambridge Philosophical Society |volume=34 |issue=2 |pages=204–212 |year=1938 |doi=10.1017/S0305004100020089|bibcode = 1938PCPS...34..204C }}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1950, molecular orbitals were completely defined as [[eigenfunctions]] (wave functions) of the self-consistent field [[Hamiltonian (quantum mechanics)|Hamiltonian]] and it was at this point that molecular orbital theory became fully rigorous and consistent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1098/rspa.1950.0104 |last=Hall |first=G.G. |journal=Proc. Roy. Soc. A |volume=202 |pages=336–344 |issue=1070 |date=7 August 1950 |title= The Molecular Orbital Theory of Chemical Valency. VI.

In calculations on molecules, the molecular orbitals are expanded in terms of an atomic orbital [[basis set (chemistry)|basis set]], leading to the [[Roothaan equations]].&lt;ref name="Frank"&gt;{{cite book |first=Frank |last=Jensen |title=Introduction to Computational Chemistry |publisher=John Wiley and Sons |year=1999 |isbn=978-0-471-98425-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; This led to the development of many [[ab initio quantum chemistry methods]]. In parallel, molecular orbital theory was applied in a more approximate manner using some empirically derived parameters in methods now known as [[semi-empirical quantum chemistry methods]].&lt;ref name="Frank"/&gt;

The success of Molecular Orbital Theory also spawned [[ligand field theory]], which was developed during the 1930s and 1940s as an alternative to [[crystal field theory]].

==Types of orbitals==
[[Image:MO diagram dihydrogen.png|thumb|right|300px|MO diagram showing the formation of molecular orbitals of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (centre) from atomic orbitals of two H atoms. The lower-energy MO is bonding with electron density concentrated between the two H nuclei. The higher-energy MO is anti-bonding with electron density concentrated behind each H nucleus.]]
Molecular orbital (MO) theory uses a [[linear combination of atomic orbitals]] (LCAO) to represent molecular orbitals resulting from bonds between atoms. These are often divided into ''bonding'' orbitals, [[antibonding|anti-bonding]] orbitals, and [[non-bonding orbital]]s. A bonding orbital concentrates electron density in the region ''between'' a given pair of atoms, so that its electron density will tend to attract each of the two nuclei toward the other and hold the two atoms together.&lt;ref name="Tarr 2013"&gt;Miessler and Tarr (2013), ''Inorganic Chemistry'', 5th ed, 117-165, 475-534.&lt;/ref&gt; An [[antibonding orbital|anti-bonding orbital]] concentrates electron density "behind" each nucleus (i.e. on the side of each atom which is farthest from the other atom), and so tends to pull each of the two nuclei away from the other and actually weaken the bond between the two nuclei. Electrons in non-bonding orbitals tend to be associated with atomic orbitals that do not interact positively or negatively with one another, and electrons in these orbitals neither contribute to nor detract from bond strength.&lt;ref name="Tarr 2013"/&gt;

Molecular orbitals are further divided according to the types of [[atomic orbital]]s they are formed from. Chemical substances will form bonding interactions if their orbitals become lower in energy when they interact with each other. Different bonding orbitals are distinguished that differ by [[electron configuration]] (electron cloud shape) and by [[energy level]]s.

The molecular orbitals of a molecule can be illustrated in [[molecular orbital diagram]]s.

==Overview==
MO theory provides a global, delocalized perspective on [[chemical bonding]]. In MO theory, ''any'' electron in a molecule may be found ''anywhere'' in the molecule, since quantum conditions allow electrons to travel under the influence of an arbitrarily large number of nuclei, as long as they are in eigenstates permitted by certain quantum rules. Thus, when excited with the requisite amount of energy through high-frequency light or other means, electrons can transition to higher-energy molecular orbitals. For instance, in the simple case of a hydrogen diatomic molecule, promotion of a single electron from a bonding orbital to an antibonding orbital can occur under UV radiation. This promotion weakens the bond between the two hydrogen atoms and can lead to photodissociation—the breaking of a chemical bond due to the absorption of light.

Although in MO theory ''some'' molecular orbitals may hold electrons that are more localized between specific pairs of molecular atoms, ''other'' orbitals may hold electrons that are spread more uniformly over the molecule. Thus, overall, bonding is far more delocalized in MO theory, which makes it more applicable to resonant molecules that have equivalent non-integer bond orders than valence bond (VB) theory. This makes MO theory more useful for the description of extended systems.

An example is the MO description of [[benzene]], {{chem|C|6|H|6}}, which is an aromatic hexagonal ring of six carbon atoms and three double bonds. In this molecule, 24 of the 30 total valence bonding electrons—24 coming from carbon atoms and 6 coming from hydrogen atoms—are located in 12 σ (sigma) bonding orbitals, which are located mostly between pairs of atoms (C-C or C-H), similarly to the electrons in the valence bond description. However, in benzene the remaining six bonding electrons are located in three π (pi) molecular bonding orbitals that are delocalized around the ring. Two of these electrons are in an MO that has equal orbital contributions from all six atoms. The other four electrons are in orbitals with vertical nodes at right angles to each other. As in the VB theory, all of these six delocalized π electrons reside in a larger space that exists above and below the ring plane. All carbon-carbon bonds in benzene are chemically equivalent. In MO theory this is a direct consequence of the fact that the three molecular π orbitals combine and evenly spread the extra six electrons over six carbon atoms.

[[File:Benzene structure.png|thumbnail|Structure of benzene]]
In molecules such as [[methane]], {{chem|C|H|4}}, the eight valence electrons are found in four MOs that are spread out over all five atoms. However, it is possible to transform the MOs into four localized sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; orbitals. Linus Pauling, in 1931, hybridized the carbon 2s and 2p orbitals so that they pointed directly at the [[hydrogen]] 1s basis functions and featured maximal overlap. However, the delocalized MO description is more appropriate for predicting [[ionization energy|ionization energies]] and the positions of spectral [[absorption band]]s. When methane is ionized, a single electron is taken from the valence MOs, which can come from the s bonding or the triply degenerate p bonding levels, yielding two ionization energies. In comparison, the explanation in VB theory is more complicated. When one electron is removed from an sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; orbital, [[resonance (chemistry)|resonance]] is invoked between four valence bond structures, each of which has a single one-electron bond and three two-electron bonds. Triply degenerate T&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and A&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ionized states (CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) are produced from different linear combinations of these four structures. The difference in energy between the ionized and ground state gives the two ionization energies.

As in benzene, in substances such as [[beta carotene]], [[chlorophyll]], or [[heme]], some electrons in the π orbitals are spread out in molecular orbitals over long distances in a molecule, resulting in light absorption in lower energies (the [[visible spectrum]]), which accounts for the characteristic colours of these substances.&lt;ref name="Griffth 1957"&gt;Griffith, J.S. and L.E. Orgel. [http://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/1957/qr/qr9571100381#!divAbstract "Ligand Field Theory".] ''Q. Rev. Chem. Soc.'' 1957, 11, 381-383&lt;/ref&gt; This and other spectroscopic data for molecules are well explained in MO theory, with an emphasis on electronic states associated with multicenter orbitals, including mixing of orbitals premised on principles of orbital symmetry matching.&lt;ref name="Tarr 2013"/&gt; The same MO principles also naturally explain some electrical phenomena, such as high [[electrical conductivity]] in the planar direction of the hexagonal atomic sheets that exist in [[graphite]]. This results from continuous band overlap of half-filled p orbitals and explains electrical conduction. MO theory recognizes that some electrons in the graphite atomic sheets are completely [[delocalized electron|delocalized]] over arbitrary distances, and reside in very large molecular orbitals that cover an entire graphite sheet, and some electrons are thus as free to move and therefore conduct electricity in the sheet plane, as if they resided in a metal.

[[File:OntheWaytoSchool-Long.png|thumb|upright=1.35|Illustration from [[William J. Long]]'s ''School of the Woods'' (1902), showing an otter teaching her young to swim]]
The '''nature fakers controversy''' was an early 20th-century American literary debate highlighting the conflict between [[science]] and sentiment in popular [[nature writing]]. The debate involved important [[United States|American]] literary, environmental and political figures. Dubbed the "War of the Naturalists" by ''[[The New York Times]]'', it revealed seemingly irreconcilable contemporary views of the natural world: while some nature writers of the day argued as to the veracity of their examples of [[anthropomorphism|anthropomorphic]] wild animals, others questioned an animal's ability to adapt, learn, teach, and reason.

The controversy arose from a new literary movement, which followed a growth of interest in the natural world beginning in the late 19th century, and in which the natural world was depicted in a compassionate rather than realistic light. Works such as [[Ernest Thompson Seton]]'s ''[[Wild Animals I Have Known]]'' (1898) and [[William J. Long]]'s ''School of the Woods'' (1902) popularized this new genre and emphasized sympathetic and individualistic animal characters. In March 1903, naturalist and writer [[John Burroughs]] published an article entitled "Real and Sham Natural History" in ''[[The Atlantic Monthly]]''. Lambasting writers such as Seton, Long, and [[Charles G. D. Roberts]] for their seemingly fantastical representations of wildlife, he also denounced the booming genre of realistic animal fiction as "[[yellow journalism]] of the woods".&lt;ref name="carson71"/&gt; Burroughs' targets responded in defense of their work in various publications, as did their supporters, and the resulting controversy raged in the public press for nearly six years.

The constant publicity given to the debate contributed to a growing distrust of the truthfulness of popular nature writing of the day, and often pitted scientist against writer. The controversy effectively ended when President [[Theodore Roosevelt]] publicly sided with Burroughs, publishing his article "Nature Fakers" in the September 1907 issue of ''[[Everybody's Magazine]]''. Roosevelt popularized the negative colloquialism by which the controversy would later be known to describe one who purposefully fabricates details about the natural world. The definition of the term later expanded to include those who depicted nature with excessive sentimentality.

==Background==
===Nature boom===
A renewed public interest in nature and its promise of aesthetic and recreational enjoyment began in the United States during the late 19th century. The country's first national park, [[Yellowstone National Park|Yellowstone]], was established in 1872, and by 1900 it had been followed by half a dozen more. Railroads made it easy to get to the parks, and their advertising promoted the wonders of nature that could be seen courtesy of their trains.  Tourists frequented the parks regularly, but there were also numerous opportunities for people to enjoy nature and outdoor recreation closer to home. City parks, such as [[New York City]]'s [[Central Park]], became popular destinations because of their accessibility, and camps like the ones owned by the [[YMCA]] were frequented by boys and girls of all ages.&lt;ref&gt;Lutts (1990), pp. 16–17&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Wilderness]] protection and the [[conservation movement]], led by figures such as [[John Muir]], founder of the [[Sierra Club]], also began to appear at this time. By the turn of the century, those in favor of recreational ideals of nature began to clash with conservationists such as Muir.&lt;ref&gt;Lutts (1990), p. 14&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, critics and natural scientists became skeptical of what they saw as a growing [[cult]] of nature, which was thought to wrongly champion sentimentality and aesthetics rather than scientific facts.&lt;ref name="Maz113"/&gt; Sympathy for animals and their survival also became a developing thought in the 19th century, due in part to wide acceptance of theories pertaining to organic [[evolution]]. In 1837, [[Charles Darwin]] wrote in his diary that "If we choose to let conjecture run wild, then animals, our fellow brethren in pain, disease, death, suffering and famine—our slaves in the most laborious works, our companions in our amusements—they may partake of our origin in one common ancestor—we may be all melted together."&lt;ref&gt;Lutts (1990), p. 21&lt;/ref&gt;

===Literature===
As the popularity and marketability of the natural world rose during the late 19th century, books dedicated to nature came to be in great demand. One reviewer noted in 1901 that "It is a part of the progress of the day that the [[Nature study]] is coming into prominence in our schemes of education, and, beyond these, is entering into our plans for coveted diversion, yet it is a real surprise that so large and increasing a number of each season's publications are devoted to the purpose."&lt;ref&gt;Lutts (1990), p. 30&lt;/ref&gt; Such [[literature]] was regularly published in a wide variety of subjects: children's animal books, wilderness novels, nature guides, and travelogues were all immensely popular.&lt;ref&gt;Stewart, p. 83&lt;/ref&gt; The study of nature quickly became part of the public school curriculum, making nature writing increasingly profitable.&lt;ref name="Maz113"&gt;Mazel, p. 113&lt;/ref&gt; As the public's hunger for such imaginative works grew, a new genre in which nature was depicted in a compassionate, rather than realistic, light began to take form.

[[File:Lobo (The King of Currumpaw).jpg|thumb|250px|Illustration of the wolf Lobo and his mate Blanca, by [[Ernest Thompson Seton]]]]
The tendency to portray animals as having human traits was not new; [[Aesop]]'s moralistic animal tales were still popular with readers of the day, and inspired such works as [[Rudyard Kipling]]'s ''[[The Jungle Book]]'' (1894). However, one of the features separating the turn-of-the-century animal writers from those before them was the desire to have their animals set an example through their noble, sympathetic characteristics.&lt;ref&gt;Mighetto, p. 36&lt;/ref&gt; [[Anna Sewell]]'s ''[[Black Beauty]]'', for example, told the story of a gentle horse seemingly from the animal's own point of view; after being published in the United States by the American Humane Education Society in 1890, Sewell's book helped further the cause against [[animal cruelty]].&lt;ref&gt;Lutts (1990), p. 22&lt;/ref&gt; The budding [[animal welfare]] movement helped establish a climate for wider public support of wildlife conservation, and soon nature writers similarly sought to gain sympathy for wild animals—specifically those who seemingly displayed honorable human traits—by depicting them in a positive light.&lt;ref&gt;Stewart, p. 85&lt;/ref&gt; One popular nature writer of the day, [[Mabel Osgood Wright]], told of wolves nobly taking their own lives after losing their mates.&lt;ref&gt;Mighetto, p. 37&lt;/ref&gt;

Author and illustrator [[Ernest Thompson Seton]] published his first book, the bestselling ''[[Wild Animals I Have Known]]'', in 1898. The first entry in a new genre of realistic wild-animal stories, Seton's collection of short stories quickly became one of the most popular books of its day.&lt;ref&gt;Lutts (1998), p. 3&lt;/ref&gt; Although he had considered himself "a naturalist of the usual type, trying merely to accumulate specimens and facts" during his early career, he later began to write factual material "in the form of romantic stories—fiction in the form of presentation, but solid in fact in their basis and their message."&lt;ref&gt;Jones, p. 134&lt;/ref&gt; The first story in the collection, "[[Lobo the King of Currumpaw|Lobo, The King of Currumpaw]]" was based upon Seton's experience hunting wolves in the Southwest. It became a classic, setting the tone for his future works that would similarly depict animals—especially predators who were often demonized in literature—as compassionate, individualistic beings.&lt;ref&gt;Lutts (1990), p. 33&lt;/ref&gt; Seton was reportedly denounced by readers for having killed Lobo, only to write about the experience; however, as biographer Brian Morris stated, the readers' sympathies "are directed, as Seton meant them to be, toward the wild animal, rather than against the teller of the tale".&lt;ref&gt;Jones, p. 139&lt;/ref&gt;

Seton's intention in writing his stories was to "freely translate" the animals' language into English, as they "have no speech as we understand it".&lt;ref&gt;Jones, p. 133–134&lt;/ref&gt; The stories were typically prefaced by the author's strong assertion of their accuracy, and ''Wild Animals I Have Known'' marked the nature writer's first emphasis on the perspective of a wild animal. As Canadian poet and author [[Charles G.D. Roberts]] described it, the genre focused on "the personality, individuality, mentality, of an animal, as well as its purely physical characteristics."&lt;ref&gt;Lutts (1998), p. 1–2&lt;/ref&gt;

==Beginning of controversy (1903)==
==="Real and Sham Natural History"===
Naturalist and writer [[John Burroughs]] (1837–1921) was respected for his numerous nature essays. Known as an outspoken advocate for the conservation movement in the United States, he was later described by his biographer [[Edward J. Renehan, Jr.|Edward Renehan]] as "a literary naturalist with a duty to record his own unique perceptions of the natural world".&lt;ref&gt;Walker, p. xxvii&lt;/ref&gt; Burroughs believed that the nature writer must remain faithful to nature as well as the personal responses to what they witness; he wrote in the introduction to his 1895 book ''Wake-Robin'' that the "literary naturalist does not take liberties with facts; facts are the flora upon which he lives. The more and the fresher the facts the better."&lt;ref name="Walker"&gt;Walker, p. 170&lt;/ref&gt;

When ''[[The Atlantic Monthly]]'' published a glowing review of the Reverend [[William J. Long]]'s 1902 work ''School of the Woods: Some Life Studies of Animal Instinct and Animal Training'', Burroughs became incensed. Long had previously published six books, and while Burroughs was not pleased with the clergyman's previous efforts, he believed this particular work was an unacceptable example of nature writing.&lt;ref&gt;Sumner, p. 41&lt;/ref&gt; Long insisted not only that animals demonstrated unique and individualistic behavior, unpredictable to science, but he also wrote that there was "absolutely no limit to the variety and adaptiveness of Nature, even in a single species."&lt;ref name="kheel95"&gt;Kheel, p. 95&lt;/ref&gt; Burroughs was not the first to take issue with the growing genre that blurred the line between fact and fiction, or the liberties it often took with the natural world; [[Ernest Ingersoll]] also found fault with ''School of the Woods'', stating it "would be an epoch-making book in both zoology and psychology could its statements be established."&lt;ref&gt;Lutts (1990), p. 38&lt;/ref&gt; Believing that authors such as Long were deliberately misleading the public for financial gain, Burroughs decided to prove that their fantastical depictions of wild animals were not only impossible, but ultimately damaging to the general public's understanding of nature.&lt;ref&gt;Kheel, p. 94&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lamb, p. 187&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:John Burroughs 1909.jpg|thumb|right|[[John Burroughs]] in 1909]]
In March 1903, Burroughs submitted a scathing essay to ''The Atlantic Monthly'' entitled "Real and Sham Natural History"; the editor, Bliss Perry, reportedly found the piece so "ill-natured" and "peevish" that he sent it back to Burroughs for revisions.&lt;ref&gt;Stewart, p. 89&lt;/ref&gt; Burroughs began his article with praise for authors such as Ingersoll, [[Frank M. Chapman]] and [[Florence Merriam Bailey]], all of whom he believed exemplified good nature writing. Championing his own strict adherence to observed fact, Burroughs singled out four books for criticism: Seton's ''Wild Animals I have Known'', Roberts' ''The Kindred of the Wild'', [[William Davenport Hulbert]]'s ''Forest Neighbours'', and Long's ''School of the Woods''.&lt;ref&gt;Maclulich, p. 114&lt;/ref&gt; In particular he blamed Seton's collection of stories for founding the sentimental animal story genre; he even amended the title of the collection to ''Wild Animals I'' Alone ''Have Known''.&lt;ref&gt;Jones, p. 135&lt;/ref&gt; Further denouncing Seton's claims that his stories featured events and behaviors he had personally witnessed, Burroughs wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Mr. Thompson Seton says in capital letters that his stories are true, and it is this emphatic assertion that makes the judicious grieve. True as romance, true in their artistic effects, true in their power to entertain the young reader, they certainly are but true as natural history they as certainly are not&amp;nbsp;... There are no stories of animal intelligence and cunning on record, that I am aware of, that match his.&lt;ref&gt;Mazel, p. 117&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Chief among Burroughs' complaints was Long's questioning of the role of [[instinct]] in [[animal learning]], something that Burroughs and many scientists of the day accepted without doubt. Long had written that after many years of studying wild animals, he was "convinced that instinct plays a much smaller part than we have supposed; that an animal's success or failure in the ceaseless struggle for life depends, not upon instinct, but upon the kind of training which the animal learns from its mother."&lt;ref&gt;Stewart, p. 87&lt;/ref&gt; In reply to this assertion, Burroughs wrote in "Real and Sham Natural History": "The crows do not train their young. They have no fortresses, or schools, or colleges, or examining boards, or diplomas, or medals of honor, or hospitals, or churches, or telephones, or postal deliveries, or anything of the sort. Indeed, the poorest backwoods hamlet has more of the appurtenances of civilization than the best organized crow or other wild animal community in the land!"&lt;ref&gt;Mazel, p. 118&lt;/ref&gt; Burroughs summed up by deeming Long a fraud, stating that his "book reads like that of a man who has really never been to the woods, but who sits in his study and cooks up these yarns from things he has read in ''[[Forest and Stream]]'', or in other sporting journals. Of real observation there is hardly a vestige in his book; of deliberate trifling with natural history there is no end".&lt;ref&gt;Perez, p. 25&lt;/ref&gt;

Soon after the publication of Burroughs' article, ''The Atlantic Monthly'' began receiving responses from readers. Among the many letters written in support for Burroughs' assertions was an article published in the ''Boston Evening Transcript'' in defense of Long's reputation as both a writer and a respected man of the cloth.&lt;ref&gt;Lutts (1990), pp. 43–44&lt;/ref&gt; Written by fellow clergyman Charles Prescott Daniels, the article, which was titled "Discord in the Forest: John Burroughs vs. William J. Long", suggested that Burroughs left "the reader with a kinder feeling for Mr. Long than for Mr. Burroughs, and [left] him, too, with a suspicion that, after all, the beasts and birds will forgive Mr. Long for having so amiably misrepresented them."&lt;ref name="maz121"&gt;Mazel, p. 121&lt;/ref&gt;

===Long's response===
Many of the authors Burroughs criticized in his essays chose not to issue direct rebuttals. As [[Jack London]] would later write, they chose to simply "climb a tree and let the cataclysm go by".&lt;ref name="Walker" /&gt; Seton, who had previously met Burroughs and had a great deal of respect for the elder naturalist, was confident enough in his own reputation so as not to stage a public reply. Other authors wrote to both him and Burroughs in Seton's defense, however; author and editor [[Hamlin Garland]] both wrote to Burroughs and spoke to him personally in this regard, saying that Seton's "stories are based on careful observation."&lt;ref&gt;Lutts (1990), p. 45&lt;/ref&gt; Three weeks after Burroughs' article appeared in ''The Atlantic Monthly'', he and Seton met at a literary dinner given by [[Andrew Carnegie]]; while accounts of the meeting vary, the two men seemed to make amends.&lt;ref&gt;Lutts (1990), p. 48–49&lt;/ref&gt;

William J. Long, on the other hand, readily became a publicly vocal enemy of the naturalist after receiving much of Burroughs' initial criticism. A [[Congregationalist]] minister from Massachusetts, Long was an amateur naturalist and avid camper who spent summers hiking in Canada. Shortly after Burroughs published his initial essay, Long was reported to have previously resigned from his parish so as to devote himself to writing and lecturing on nature full-time.&lt;ref name="maz121"/&gt; Rather than be discouraged by Burroughs' criticism—which included the other man calling Long "the worst of these nature-writing offenders"&lt;ref name="carson71"&gt;Carson (1971)&lt;/ref&gt;—within weeks of the publication of "Real and Sham Natural History", Long submitted a stern reply to the ''Boston Evening Transcript''. Two months later, he published a longer article titled "The Modern School of Nature-Study and its Critics" in the ''North American Review''.&lt;ref&gt;Stewart, p. 89–90&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:WilliamJLong-Orioles.png|left|thumb|Illustration of orioles who have devised a way of gathering thread from a piece of cloth, from Long's ''Way of the Wood Folk'']]
In the latter essay, Long insisted that there was a difference between the study of nature and the study of science; whereas science concerned itself with laws and generalizations, the study of nature was far more complex as it allowed for the recognition of individual life forms.&lt;ref&gt;Stewart, p. 90&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote, "The difference between Nature and Science is the difference between a man who loves animals, and so understands them, and the man who studies Zoology; it is the difference between the woman who cherishes her old-fashioned flower-garden and the professor who lectures on Botany in a college class-room."&lt;ref&gt;Mazel, p. 123&lt;/ref&gt; Long's intention was to divide the old school naturalists (which included Burroughs among its members) from what he saw as the newly formed school, of which he was part, whose members were capable of seeing animals as individuals. Because he wrote personal nature essays, and not scientific reports, Long believed that his readers required from him "not simply eyes and ears and a note-book; but insight, imagination, and, above all, an intense human sympathy, by which alone the inner life of an animal becomes luminous, and without which the living creatures are little better than stuffed specimens".&lt;ref&gt;Maclulich, p. 116&lt;/ref&gt;

While his explanation was found to be credible by some readers, Long's critics faulted an example he gave of two [[New World oriole|orioles]] he had seen building a nest outside his window.&lt;ref&gt;Sumner, p. 45&lt;/ref&gt; Intended to prove his thesis about the unpredictable and adaptive nature of wild animals, he wrote of how the pair "plainly deliberated" their elaborate swinging nest that had been made out of three sticks fastened together; when finished, the birds then "tied a single knot at the extreme end" of a dangling string so it would not unravel over time.&lt;ref name="stew92"&gt;Stewart, p. 92&lt;/ref&gt; Burroughs and his allies were again incensed at Long's insistence that what he wrote was based entirely upon fact, and quickly responded with criticism; Burroughs' written reply reportedly proved to be almost too harsh for publication. ''The Atlantic Monthly'' did not wish to escalate the debate, so it was ultimately published by ''[[Century Magazine]]''. Evoking Long's story of the orioles, Burroughs wrote, "After such an example as this, how long will it be before the water-birds will be building little rush cradles for their young or rush boats driven about the ponds and lakes by means of leafy sails, or before Jenny Wren will be living in a log cabin of her own construction?"&lt;ref name="stew92"/&gt;

==Escalation (1903–1904)==
===Animal surgery===
Threatened financially by Burroughs' condemnation, Long's publishers came to their client's defense by distributing a pamphlet defending his positions. In late 1903, Long published a new book titled ''A Little Brother to the Bear''. In the preface, he wrote: "Except where it is plainly stated otherwise, all the incidents and observations have passed under my own eyes and have been confirmed later by other observers&amp;nbsp;... I have simply tried to make all these animals as interesting to the reader as they were to me when I discovered them."&lt;ref name="lut73"/&gt; While ''[[The New York Times]]'' reviewed it favorably, pointing out its "close observation and loving attention to the details of wood life", Long's critics were quick to note a number of propositions regarding wildlife. An essay in the book titled "Animal Surgery", in which Long wrote of various animals' ability to treat and mend their own injuries, particularly riled his critics.&lt;ref name="lut73"&gt;Lutts (1990), p. 73&lt;/ref&gt; He told of how animals such as muskrat, beaver and bear were capable of intentionally bandaging their wounds and stumps of amputated limbs by coating them with materials such as tree resin or clay to keep the injury clean.&lt;ref&gt;Lutts (1990), p. 74&lt;/ref&gt; The example that received the greatest attention was the story about a "[[American Woodcock|woodcock]] genius" who set his own broken leg and applied a cast to the injury:

[[File:Scolopax Woodcock Genius-Long.png|thumb|right|The "woodcock genius" sets his broken leg with a cast made of clay and straw; illustration by [[Charles Copeland (illustrator)|Charles Copeland]]]]
&lt;blockquote&gt;At first he took soft clay in his bill from the edge of the water and seemed to be smearing it on one leg near the knee. Then he fluttered away on one foot for a short distance and seemed to be pulling tiny roots and fibers of grass, which he worked into the clay that he had already smeared on his leg. Again he took some clay and plastered it over the fibers, putting on more and more till I could plainly see the enlargement, working away with strange, silent intentness for fully fifteen minutes, while I watched and wondered, scarce believing my eyes. Then he stood perfectly still for a full hour under an overhanging sod, where the eye could with difficulty find him, his only motion meanwhile being an occasional rubbing and smoothing of the clay bandage with his bill, until it hardened enough to suit him, whereupon he fluttered away from the brook and disappeared in the thick woods.&lt;ref&gt;Lutts (1990), pp. 76–77&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Long's theories about animal surgery garnered negative attention from the scientific community as well as the literary; biologist [[William Morton Wheeler]] wrote to ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'' in February 1904 that Long's story was "a series of anecdotes which for rank and impossible humanization of the animal can hardly be surpassed."&lt;ref&gt;Lutts (1990), pp. 77&lt;/ref&gt; Other scientists agreed about the dubiousness of Long's claims, and publicly rebuked him for not providing evidence as to his observations in a scientifically-accepted format. Long responded in turn, insisting that "If scientists and [[Comparative psychology|comparative-psychologists]] are honestly looking for new facts in the animal world, I have enough to fill several regular editions of ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'', every one of which is supported not only by my own personal observation, but by the testimony of other honest men whose word can be taken without hesitation."&lt;ref&gt;Lutts (1990), p. 79&lt;/ref&gt; As to the woodcock story, Long provided several accounts from other men who had witnessed as much; an Ohio man, for example, reportedly found upon shooting a similar bird that it "had evidently broken its leg above the knee joint. There was a bandage around it, composed of a hard clay-like substance, interwoven with grass or a woody fiber of some kind. The bone seemed to have been set properly and had knit perfectly." None of Long's witnesses were able to provide specimens for study, however, and ''Science'' followed Long's essay with the note, "We Hope that this discussion will not be carried further."&lt;ref&gt;Lutts (1990), p. 80&lt;/ref&gt;

===Animal psychology===
Ruminating on his previous clashes with Long in regard to an animal's ability to learn behaviors, Burroughs began to focus the ire of his essay-writing on those who upheld the idea of animal psychology. In a series of articles published in ''Century Magazine'', he steadfastly argued that animals functioned on little more than instinct and a very limited ability to learn from experience.&lt;ref name="lut85"&gt;Lutts (1990), p. 85&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote that creatures, unlike humans, are "rational without reason, and wise without understanding."&lt;ref&gt;Lutts (1990), p. 143&lt;/ref&gt; Although mainly repeating his earlier points, one of Burroughs' essays was accompanied by a cartoon parodying Long's ''School of the Woods''; dubbed "A Lesson in Wisdom", it showed Mother Nature sitting in a field surrounded by five foxes who look on as she reads from a book titled ''The Fox Who Lost His Tail in the Trap''.&lt;ref name="lut85"/&gt;

The belief that animals were intelligent enough to learn and reason, much like a human, was largely born from Darwin's assertion of the evolutionary link between humans and animals. Beginning in the late 19th century and into the early 20th century, the progression from the cause of animal welfare—due to the budding belief that animals could feel pain and suffering—to that of an animal's mental capacity was readily made in popular nature writing.&lt;ref&gt;Lutts (1990), p. 146&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, Long was not the first to write of the learned intelligence of animals. Seton often stressed in his stories the wit of the animals he witnessed, as well as the fact that most of them had been "taught" survival skills by either their mothers or their pack leaders. Other writers supported the idea of animal education: Ernest Ingersoll wrote of "morning lessons" in hunting for nuts, and respected bird watcher [[Olive Thorne Miller]] described several different teaching endeavors, such as a music lesson taught from one mother bird to her chicks. Miller would also suggest, although partly in jest, that even some of the flowers were intelligent.&lt;ref&gt;Mighetto, p. 39&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy dies down (1904–1905)==
[[File:William j. long.jpg|thumb|Long as depicted by ''The Bookman'' in 1907]]
Largely silent until then, in 1904 both Seton and Roberts made small efforts to defend their brand of nature writing from its critics, mainly Burroughs. In the preface to his new book ''The Watchers of the Trails'', Roberts specifically responded to Burroughs' criticism by carefully pointing out that his stories were "avowedly fiction". However, he continued: "They are, at the same time, true, in that the material of which they are moulded consists of facts".&lt;ref&gt;Maclulich, p. 117&lt;/ref&gt; Later that year, ''Century Magazine'' published Seton's only public response to Burroughs' criticisms, especially those made in the previous year's ''Atlantic Monthly'' article in which the naturalist branded Seton the originator of the faulty genre. Seton's response was in the form of a lighthearted tale about a critic named Little Mucky—obviously meant to parody Burroughs himself—who climbs a hill called Big Periodic, only to throw mud at a newcomer who attracts attention away from him. The moral of the story, Seton wrote, was that "Notoriety is a poisonous substitute for fame."&lt;ref name="lut85"/&gt;

Despite the best efforts of the press, the debate began to die down in late 1904. In December that year, after suffering from ailing eyesight for several years, Long went temporarily blind at the age of 47.&lt;ref name="lut87"&gt;Lutts (1990), p. 87&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this setback, he continued to write; in early 1905 he began publishing a series of essays in ''[[Harper's Monthly]]'' under the pseudonym Peter Rabbit; told from the point of view of the "author", the essays commented upon the human condition, animal intelligence, and the controversy first begun by Burroughs two years prior. The essays were published a year later in a collection titled ''Brier-Patch Philosophy''. This book included the dedication: "To those who have found Their Own World to be something of a Brier-Patch the Rabbit Dedicates his little book of Cheerful Philosophy."&lt;ref name="lut87"/&gt;

Burroughs continued to publicly disagree with Long and his allies, and a number of his essays dedicated to "sham nature history" were collected in the volume ''Ways of Nature'', published in late 1905. Admitting that his authorial tone had changed since 1903, he wrote in the preface that "My readers will find this volume quite a departure in certain ways from the tone and spirit of my previous books, especially in regard to the subject of animal intelligence. Heretofore I have made the most of every gleam of intelligence of bird or four-footed beast that came under my observation, often, I fancy, making too much of it, and giving the wild creatures credit for more 'sense' than they really possessed."&lt;ref&gt;Lutts (1990), pp. 88–89&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mabel Osgood Wright]] weighed in on the debate in a 1905 essay titled "Nature as a Field for Fiction", in which she criticized both sides. Believing that nature writing could imbue animal characters with human qualities in order to better connect with the reader on an emotional level, Wright argued that nature writing should nonetheless strive to be factual and not fantastical.&lt;ref&gt;Perez, p. 29&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Roberts had largely escaped criticism for his previous work, his novel ''Red Fox'' attracted attention from Burroughs and his allies after its publication in 1906. The work contains stories relating to a single animal, the eponymous Red Fox, who was described by the author as "fairly typical, both in his characteristics and in the experiences that befall him, in spite of the fact that he is stronger and cleverer than the average run of foxes."&lt;ref&gt;Lutts (1990), p. 97&lt;/ref&gt; Burroughs' critique of the book began by expressing his admiration for Roberts' "genius", but again stressed his belief that animals were governed by instinct, rather than instruction or intuition. He pointed to particular passages, such as when the fox escaped a group of hounds by running across the backs of sheep on a field, as disingenuous and misleading.&lt;ref&gt;Lutts (1990), p. 99&lt;/ref&gt;

==Roosevelt's involvement==
===Pre-1907===
[[File:Theodore Roosevelt by John Singer Sargent, 1903.jpg|thumb|right|[[Theodore Roosevelt]]'s official White House portrait by [[John Singer Sargent]], 1903]]
President [[Theodore Roosevelt]] was a well-publicized nature-enthusiast, known for his grand hunting expeditions. While he admired the natural world and the animals who inhabited it, he believed that animals served a singular purpose: to satisfy human needs, especially in the name of progress.&lt;ref&gt;Lutts (1990), p. 144&lt;/ref&gt; Roosevelt had been following the debate in newspaper articles and magazines with great interest, and as a result he became a friend and confidant of John Burroughs; shortly after Burroughs' first article condemning popular nature writers as sham naturalists, Roosevelt sent him a letter of support as well as an invitation to travel west in each other's company. In April 1903, Roosevelt and Burroughs explored [[Yellowstone National Park]] and its surrounding areas together.&lt;ref&gt;Lutts (1990), p. 2&lt;/ref&gt;

In late 1905, Roosevelt received a copy of Long's book ''Northern Trails'' from the publisher. Based upon the author's travels in Canada, most of the stories involved a noble, white wolf named Wayeeses. As in other works, Long asserted that "every incident in this wolf's life, from his grasshopper hunting to the cunning caribou chase, and from the den in the rocks to the meeting of wolf and children on the storm-swept barrens, is minutely true in fact, and is based squarely upon my own observations and that of my Indians."&lt;ref name="lut90"&gt;Lutts (1990), p. 90&lt;/ref&gt; While Roosevelt reportedly enjoyed a majority of the book—he even read it aloud to his children—he found fault with Long's dramatic description of how a wolf killed caribou by piercing the animal's heart with its teeth. "A terrific rush," Long wrote in ''Northern Trails'', "a quick snap under the stag's chest just behind the fore legs, where the heart lay".&lt;ref name="lut90"/&gt; Drawing upon his own extensive hunting experience, Roosevelt wrote confidentially to the book's publisher about Long's description being "sheer nonsense", concluding that it "is so very unusual" and anatomically impossible that it could not be true.&lt;ref&gt;Lutts (1990), p. 91&lt;/ref&gt; In his letter, of which he also sent a copy to Burroughs, Roosevelt pointed out the physical difficulty a wolf would have if attempting to kill its prey in such a manner, while also commenting upon the unlikeliness of other wolf stories written by Long.&lt;ref&gt;Lutts (1990), p. 92&lt;/ref&gt;

Burroughs agreed with the President's assertions, and urged him to comment publicly on the subject, although the other man demurred. When Roosevelt published ''Outdoor Pastimes of an American Hunter'' in October 1905, however, he not only dedicated it to the elder naturalist, but he also made his first public foray in what would become known as the nature fakers controversy: "I wish to express my hearty appreciation of your warfare against the sham nature-writers—those whom you have called 'the yellow journalists of the woods'&amp;nbsp;... You in your own person have illustrated what can be done by the lover of nature who has trained himself to keen observation, who describes accurately what is thus observed, and who, finally, possesses the additional gift of writing with charm and interest."&lt;ref&gt;Lutts (1990), p. 94&lt;/ref&gt;

==="Nature Fakers"===
After four years of privately denouncing the popular nature writers in letters and conversation, Roosevelt decided to weigh in publicly; while alerting Burroughs that he had finally broken his silence, he wrote: "I know that as President I ought not to do this".&lt;ref&gt;Lutts, p. 102&lt;/ref&gt; He had given an interview to journalist Edward B. Clark, who quoted Roosevelt in the article "Roosevelt on the Nature [[Charlatan|Faker]]s" in the June 1907 issue of ''Everybody's Magazine''. Roosevelt not only spoke out against Long, but other authors like [[Jack London]] and Roberts, who wrote what he called "'unnatural' history".&lt;ref&gt;Stewart, p. 97&lt;/ref&gt; Roosevelt popularized the term "nature faker" over Clark's original spelling, and defined it in his essay as "an object of derision to every scientist worthy of the name, to every real lover of the wilderness, to every faunal naturalist, to every true hunter or nature lover. But it is evident that [the nature faker] completely deceives many good people who are wholly ignorant of wild life. Sometimes he draws on his own imagination for his fictions; sometimes he gets them second-hand from irresponsible guides or trappers or Indians."&lt;ref&gt;Mazel, p. 141&lt;/ref&gt; He voiced displeasure with and disbelief of London's descriptions of [[dog fighting]] in ''[[White Fang]]'', as well as Long's stories about Wayeeses the wolf taking down prey; Roosevelt was so specific as to debate the depicted outcome of the fights based on the size of the animals involved.&lt;ref name="Lutts"&gt;Lutts (1990), p. 108&lt;/ref&gt; Long's books in particular were deemed a "genuine crime", especially against the country's children. Fearing that a curriculum including sentimental nature stories would corrupt young children, Roosevelt wrote: "As for the matter of giving these books to children for the purpose of teaching them the facts of natural history—why, it's an outrage."&lt;ref name="kheel95"/&gt;

[[File:Clover-plover-r-w.wood-how-to-tell-the-birds-from-the-flowers.gif|thumb|left|The [[Clover]] and the [[Plover]], from [[Robert Williams Wood]]'s ''How to Tell the Birds from the Flowers'' (1907)]]
Not long after Roosevelt's views were made public, Long responded with vigor, and the resulting publicity started the controversy anew. He began by sending a private letter to the President, which he later released to the press, informing Roosevelt that he would soon regret his "foolish words&amp;nbsp;... With all my soul I regret this necessity and shrink from it, but you have brought it upon yourself."&lt;ref name="Lutts" /&gt; In an interview with ''The New York Times'', Long called Roosevelt "cowardly" and the article "venomous", but his main criticism stemmed from the President's status as a "gamekiller"; Roosevelt, Long claimed, "has no sympathy with any brand of nature study except his own."&lt;ref&gt;Lutts (1990), pp. 108–109&lt;/ref&gt; While a number of scientists wrote in support of Roosevelt and his position, Long produced several witnesses to prove his claims; to combat one of Roosevelt's specific complaints, Long provided a statement from "a full-blooded [[Sioux]] Indian" who declared that wolves in the area where Wayeeses was said to live were known to attack prey in the chest. Long also insisted that he himself had come upon the remains of a deer slain in a similar way.&lt;ref name="carson71"/&gt;

Long's most effective tactic against Roosevelt, however, was not to argue biological matters, but to attack the President's motives in becoming involved in such a debate. In reference to Roosevelt's published works describing his hunting expeditions, Long wrote: "I find after carefully reading two of his big books that every time he gets near the heart of a wild thing he invariably puts a bullet through it."&lt;ref name="carson71"/&gt; ''[[The Boston Globe]]'' published an article titled "President a Slayer Not Lover of Animals", while the same missive was called "Long Will Combat Roosevelt Until Latter is Whipped" in Philadelphia's ''[[Public Ledger (Philadelphia)|Public Ledger]]''; in it, Long wrote: "Roosevelt is a man who takes savage delight in whooping through the woods killing everything in sight." He continued, "The idea of Mr. Roosevelt assuming the part of a naturalist is absurd. He is a hunter".&lt;ref&gt;Lutts (1990), p. 112&lt;/ref&gt;

Not everyone took the President's involvement in the controversy seriously; he was often included in satirical cartoons of the day, pointing to the superficial and tedious disagreements for which the writers lambasted one another. Writing in the June 8, 1907 issue of the ''Outlook'', editor [[Lyman Abbot]] stated that Roosevelt's desire to become embroiled in such a debate stemmed from his "extraordinary vitality, coupled with his unusual interest in all that concerns human welfare" making "it very difficult for him to keep silence in the presence of anything which he thinks injurious to his fellow-men."&lt;ref&gt;Mazel, p. 143&lt;/ref&gt; The President's participation in the controversy attested to its magnitude, however; as one observer wrote, "From an insignificant smudge [the issue] has become a roaring blaze and its sparks are kindling throughout the land."&lt;ref&gt;Mighetto, p. 43&lt;/ref&gt;

Roosevelt did not at first respond to Long's claims, allegedly considering the author "too small game to shoot twice."&lt;ref&gt;Lutts (1990), p. 109&lt;/ref&gt; He did, however, write to Burroughs that he had "no quarrel with Mr. Long for the conclusions he draws from the facts. Our quarrel with him is because he invents the facts."&lt;ref&gt;Lutts (1990), p. 122&lt;/ref&gt; Burroughs proceeded to publicly defend the President against Long's attacks, condemning him and the expert witnesses Long produced to support his claims about the events and behaviors he depicted in his works. Newspapers around the country continuously published interviews with the two naturalists, while comedic depictions of the controversy and its participants were becoming popular with readers.&lt;ref&gt;Lutts (1990), p. 115&lt;/ref&gt; One such parody referred to a non-existent book called ''How to Tell the Animals from the Wild Flowers'', including an illustration which depicted an anthropomorphic "[[Dandy]] Lion" with a cane, top hat and monocle.&lt;ref&gt;Stewart, p. 93&lt;/ref&gt; This joke inspired a similarly satirical book, which was published under the title ''How to Tell the Birds from the Flowers''; a collection of humorous illustrations and poems by physicist and children's author [[Robert Williams Wood]], the work included pairings of birds and their corresponding flowers, emphasizing their visual similarities. Making a thinly veiled reference to the much publicized controversy surrounding those authors who were now called "nature fakers", the book concludes: "I have freely drawn upon / The works of [[Asa Gray|Gray]] and [[John James Audubon|Audubon]], / Avoiding though the frequent blunders / Of those who study Nature's wonders."&lt;ref&gt;Lutts (1990), p. 118&lt;/ref&gt;

==End of controversy and aftermath==
Seeing that his initial pronouncement did nothing to quell the controversy surrounding the faults of popular nature writing, Roosevelt finally responded to Long's ongoing criticism in the fall of 1907. His article, which was written under his own name and simply titled "Nature Fakers", was published in the September issue of ''Everybody's Magazine''.&lt;ref&gt;Lutts (1990), p. 128&lt;/ref&gt; Beginning with a list of nature writers that the President admired and felt best represented the genre (Burroughs, Muir, and Olive Thorne Miller, among others), he soon fell into criticizing the "yellow journalists of the woods" who "can easily believe three impossible things before breakfast; and they do not mind in the least if the impossibilities are mutually contradictory".&lt;ref name="lut130"&gt;Lutts (1990), p. 130&lt;/ref&gt; While he focused on the "nature fakers", especially Long, he shifted the focus of his attack to place responsibility not on the authors, but on their publishers and the school boards who regularly accepted their works for reading material. He wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Our quarrel is not with these men, but with those who give them their chance. We who believe in the study of nature feel that a real knowledge and appreciation of wild things, of trees, flowers, birds, and of the grim and crafty creatures of the wilderness, give an added beauty and health to life. Therefore we abhor deliberate or reckless untruth in this study as much as in any other; and therefore we feel that a grave wrong is committed by all who, holding a position that entitles them to respect, yet condone and encourage such untruth.&lt;ref name="lut130"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

{{quote box |bgcolor=#c6dbf7 |width=22em |fontsize =95% |quote=&lt;poem&gt;
John Burroughs, who's a shark on birds
(He classifies 'em by a feather),
Avers that they're devoid of words
And simply cannot talk together.
He gives the nature-fakers fits
Who picture birds in conversation,
And tears their story books to bits
In scientific indignation.

But there's a wren outside my door
That talks whenever I go near him,
And talks so glibly, furthermore,
That I just wish that John could hear him.
Of mornings, when I stroll about,
The while he hymns his glad thanksgiving,
He interrupts himself to shout:
"Hey! Ain't it glorious to be living?"&lt;/poem&gt;

With Roosevelt's final public word on the matter, the controversy began to die down in earnest, although its key players continued to comment on the debate's major points for the next few years. ''The New York Times'' favored the President's position in an editorial titled "The War of the Naturalists", while some still supported Long and his literary efforts. Long was traveling in Maine when Roosevelt's "Nature Fakers" article was published, and did not respond to the criticisms against him with his past vigor. He later wrote that "the only fakir in the whole controversy, in my judgment, is the big fakir at Washington". Long's literary reputation steadily declined, although he continued to write and publish well into the early 1950s.&lt;ref&gt;Lutts (1990), p. 182&lt;/ref&gt; For his remaining life, Burroughs continued to write disparagingly about the effect of sentimental animal stories. In his 1908 book ''Leaf And Tendril'', he wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
A great many intelligent persons tolerate or encourage our fake natural history on the ground that they find it entertaining, and that it interests the school-children in the wild life about them. Is the truth, then, without value for its own sake? What would these good people think of a United States school history that took the same liberties with facts that some of our nature writers do: that, for instance, made Washington take his army over the Delaware in balloons, or in sleighs on the solid ice with bands playing; or that made Lincoln a victim of the Evil Eye; or that portrayed his slayer as a self-sacrificing hero; or that represented the little [[USS Monitor|Monitor]] that eventful day on [[Battle of Hampton Roads|Hampton Roads]] as diving under the [[USS Merrimack (1855)|Merrimac]] and tossing it ashore on its beak?

The nature fakers take just this kind of liberties with the facts of our natural history. The young reader finds it entertaining, no doubt, but is this sufficient justification?&lt;ref&gt;Burroughs, John. (1908). ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=LIU0AAAAMAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=burroughs+leaf+and+tendril&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=B75ZAVwSL0&amp;sig=bWTTL37q76kDJe1dBXWMd3XzyMc&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=ZSPaS5WLL5GE9AS91uFM&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CAYQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Leaf and Tendril]''. New York: Houghton, Mifflin and Company. pp. 103–104.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Also in 1908, Jack London broke his silence on his condemnation during the controversy by publishing an essay in ''[[Collier's Weekly]]'' entitled "The Other Animals". Directly addressing Roosevelt's past criticism of his novels, London called the President "[[anthropocentrism|homocentric]]" and "amateur".&lt;ref&gt;"[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9A06E2DC133EE233A25752C3A96E9C946997D6CF London Answers Roosevelt; Revives the Nature Faker Dispute&amp;nbsp;– Calls President an Amateur]". ''The New York Times''. August 31, 1908. Retrieved April 29, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; He further wrote: "I have been guilty of writing two animal—two books about dogs. The writing of these two stories, on my part, was in truth a protest against the 'humanizing' of animals, of which it seemed to me several 'animal writers' had been profoundly guilty. Time and again, and many times, in my narratives, I wrote, speaking of my dog-heroes: 'He did not think these things; he merely did them,' etc. And I did this repeatedly, to the clogging of my narrative and in violation of my artistic canons; and I did it in order to hammer into the average human understanding that these dog-heroes of mine were not directed by abstract reasoning, but by instinct, sensation, and emotion, and by simple reasoning. Also, I endeavored to make my stories in line with the facts of evolution; I hewed them to the mark set by scientific research, and awoke, one day, to find myself bundled neck and crop into the camp of the nature-fakers."&lt;ref&gt;"[http://london.sonoma.edu/Writings/Revolution/animals.html Revolution and Other Essays: The Other Animals]". The Jack London Online Collection. Retrieved April 15, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hoping to establish his credentials once and for all as an expert field naturalist, Ernest Thompson Seton spent several years of the controversy working diligently on his two-volume work ''Life-Histories of Northern Animals'', which was published in 1909. After an enlarged edition of the book was published as ''Lives of Game Animals'', Seton was ironically awarded the Burroughs Medal in 1927, a prize named after the venerable naturalist who had once so criticized Seton's work.&lt;ref&gt;Maclulich, p. 121&lt;/ref&gt;

Over time, the term "nature faker" began to take on a new meaning; rather than describing someone who purposefully told false stories about animals, it became synonymous with those who overly sentimentalized the natural world. In 1910, journalist and writer [[Richard Harding Davis]] published a short story titled "The Nature Faker" in ''Collier's Weekly'', which used the negative colloquialism to refer to the lead character, Herrick, a hapless nature sentimentalist.&lt;ref&gt;Lutts (1990), p. 173&lt;/ref&gt; Animation pioneer [[John R. Bray]] also showcased this new definition of "nature faker" while satirizing Roosevelt&lt;ref&gt;Beckerman, Howard. (2003). ''Animation: The Whole Story''. New York: Allworth Communications, Inc. p. 23&lt;/ref&gt; in two silent cartoons called "Colonel Heeza Liar, Nature Faker" (1915 and 1924).&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.bcdb.com/cartoons/Paramount_Pictures/Bray_Productions/Paramount_Pictograph/Colonel_Heeza_Liar/index.html Colonel Heeza Liar Cartoon Information]". The Big Cartoon Database. Retrieved April 29, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

The controversy had far-reaching effects in literary and scientific circles, and marked the only time that a President of the United States weighed in as a "literary and cultural critic—specifically, as an ecocritic."&lt;ref&gt;Warren, p. 151&lt;/ref&gt; Though blind naturalist and author [[Clarence Hawkes]] deemed the literary debate "a veritable tempest in the teapot", after the controversy had died down, he came to believe "if I ever make a bad break in regard to my natural history statements that I was doomed."&lt;ref&gt;Lutts (1990), p. 138&lt;/ref&gt; The author Ralph H. Lutts wrote in his 1990 work ''The Nature Fakers: Wildlife, Science &amp; Sentiment'', the nature fakers controversy "was far more than a clash over the accuracy of animal stories or the question of whether animals can reason"; rather, the debate signified the changing sensibilities of writers and readers at the turn of the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;Lutts (1990), p. 161&lt;/ref&gt;

Certain scholarly funding agencies make a distinction between [[research|investigators]] and '''new investigators'''. New investigators would be evaluated in a different way when competing for funding with more seasoned researchers, or they would be able to access funding resources specific to them. The rationale behind is to avoid the current trend that for certain [[grant (money)|grants]] the average age of the researchers receiving it for the first time keeps increasing over the years (See graph).&lt;ref&gt;[http://grants.nih.gov/grants/new_investigators/]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Definition ==

The formal definition of a new investigator varies with the funding agency. For example, for the [[NIH]], a new investigator is one that does not have a story of previous funding. Other organizations, such as the [[Alzheimer's Association]], consider a new investigator someone that is less than 10 years past their [[PhD]] degree. The [[Canadian Institutes of Health Research]] require a maximum of 60 months holding a full-time research appointment, and the [[Leukemia Research Foundation]] consider them to be within seven years of their first independent position. The [[Medical Research Council (UK)]] simply considers postdoctoral researchers in their first academic post.

The equivalent term '''Early Researcher''' (or Early Career Researcher) is also used in different ways, where for example, for the [[Australian Research Council]] it means someone that received a PhD or equivalent research doctorate within five years, or for the Ontario [[Ministry of Research and Innovation (Ontario)|Ministry of Research and Innovation]] must be an independent researcher within the first five years of the start of their independent academic research career.

Many journals have recognized the essential contributions and achievements of early researchers and highlited their profiles in different fomats. For instance the Nature research group journal [https://www.nature.com/commsbio/ Communications Biology] has lanuched a series for early career scientists, reporting some of the rising stars in all fields of biology throughout the year [https://www.nature.com/articles/s42003-018-0061-3].

'''Pioneer P-30''' (also known as Atlas-Able 5A, or Pioneer Y) was intended to be a [[Moon|lunar]] orbiter probe, but the mission failed shortly after launch on September 25, 1960. The objectives were to place a highly instrumented probe in lunar orbit, to investigate the environment between the [[Earth]] and [[Moon]], and to develop technology for controlling and maneuvering spacecraft from Earth. It was equipped to estimate the Moon's mass and topography of the poles, record the distribution and velocity of [[micrometeorite]]s, and study [[radiation]], [[magnetic field]]s, and low frequency [[electromagnetic wave]]s in space. A mid-course propulsion system and injection rocket would have been the first [[United States]] self-contained propulsion system capable of operation many months after launch at great distances from Earth and the first U.S. tests of maneuvering a satellite in space.

==Mission==

Nearly a year passed between the first Atlas-Able launch in November 1959 and this second attempt due to a shortage of Atlas boosters as well as intense competition between [[NASA]] and the [[U.S. Air Force]] for use of the pads at [[Cape Canaveral]]. The spacecraft was launched on Atlas 80D coupled to Thor-Able upper stages including a Hercules ABL solid propellant third stage, one year and a day after the Atlas-Able pad explosion on LC-12. While P-3 had used a recycled booster from the Mercury program, which had a number of custom modifications, P-30's launch vehicle (Atlas 80D) was a standard-configuration Atlas D ICBM with the exception of thicker skin to support the additional weight of the upper stages. Atlas BECO was performed at T+250 seconds and SECO at T+275 seconds. Vernier solo mode was not planned for this launch due to the direct ascent trajectory and VECO was to take place at T+280 seconds, however a malfunction of a timer relay prevented this from happening and the verniers continued operating until propellant depletion. There were also minor problems with the Atlas pneumatic and flight control systems, however none of them negatively affected overall booster performance. At an altitude of about {{convert|370|km|mi|abbr=on}}, the first stage separated from the second stage. The Able second stage ignited and started up properly, however thrust quickly decayed and then dropped to zero. The vehicle was unable to achieve Earth orbit, re-entered, and was believed to have come down somewhere in the [[Indian Ocean]]. Signals were returned by the payload for 17 minutes after launch. The mission was designed to reach the Moon approximately 62 hours after launch. The second stage malfunction was attributed to a loss of pressure in the propellant feed system, starving the engine of oxidizer. Although the mission was a failure, ground controllers fired Able VA's onboard liquid propellant hydrazine rocket engine — the first time that an onboard motor was fired on a space vehicle.&lt;ref&gt;A.A. Siddiqi, Deep Space Chronicle, pg 26., NASA SP-2002-4524, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

== Spacecraft design ==

Pioneer P-30 was almost identical to the earlier [[Pioneer P-3]] satellite which failed, a 1-meter diameter sphere with a propulsion system mounted on the bottom giving a total length of {{convert|1.4|m|in|abbr=off|sp=us}}. The mass of the structure and aluminum alloy shell was about {{convert|30|kg|lb|abbr=on}} and the propulsion units roughly {{convert|90|kg|lb|abbr=on}}. Four [[solar panel]]s, each {{convert|60|x|60|cm|in|abbr=on}} and containing 2200 [[solar cell]]s in 22 100-cell nodules, extended from the sides of the spherical shell in a "paddle-wheel" configuration with a total span of about {{convert|2.7|m|in|abbr=off|sp=us}}. The solar panels charged [[nickel-cadmium battery|nickel-cadmium batteries]]. Inside the shell, a large spherical hydrazine tank made up most of the volume, topped by two smaller spherical nitrogen tanks and a 90 N injection rocket to slow the spacecraft down to go into lunar orbit, which was designed to be capable of firing twice during the mission. Attached to the bottom of the sphere was a 90 N vernier rocket for mid-course propulsion and lunar orbit maneuvers which could be fired four times.

Around the upper hemisphere of the hydrazine tank was a ring-shaped instrument platform which held the batteries in two packs, two 1.5 W UHF transmitters and diplexers, logic modules for scientific instruments, two command receivers, decoders, a buffer/amplifier, three converters, a telebit, a command box, and most of the scientific instruments. Two dipole UHF antennas protruded from the top of the sphere on either side of the injection rocket nozzle. Two dipole UHF antennas and a long VLF antenna protruded from the bottom of the sphere. The transmitters operated on a frequency of 378 [[megahertz]].

Thermal control was planned to be achieved by fifty small "propeller blade" devices on the surface of the sphere. The blades themselves were made of reflective material and consist of four vanes which were flush against the surface, covering a black heat-absorbing pattern painted on the sphere. A thermally sensitive coil was attached to the blades in such a way that low temperatures within the satellite would cause the coil to contract and rotate the blades and expose the heat absorbing surface, and high temperatures would cause the blades to cover the black patterns. Square heat-sink units were also mounted on the surface of the sphere to help dissipate heat from the interior.

== On-board equipment ==

The scientific instruments consisted of an [[ion chamber]] and [[Geiger-Müller tube]] to measure total radiation flux, a proportional radiation counter telescope to measure high energy radiation, a [[scintillation counter]] to monitor low-energy radiation, a VLF receiver for natural radio waves, a transponder to study electron density, and part of the flux-gate and search coil magnetometers mounted on the instrument platform. The micrometeorite detector and sun scanner were mounted on the sphere. The difference between the payload of Pioneer P-30 and the earlier Pioneer P-3 was the replacement of the TV facsimile system on P-3 with a scintillation spectrometer to study the Earth's (and possible lunar) radiation belts, mounted on the instrument platform, and a plasma probe mounted on the sphere to measure energy and momentum distribution of protons above a few kilovolts to study the radiation effect of solar flares. The total mass of the science package including electronics and power supply was roughly {{convert|60|kg|lb|abbr=on}}. Total cost of the mission was estimated at 9–10 million dollars.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3259">In [[general relativity]], the '''positive energy theorem''' (more commonly known as the '''positive mass conjecture''') states that, assuming the [[energy conditions#Mathematical statement|dominant energy condition]], the mass of an [[asymptotically flat spacetime]] is non-negative; furthermore, the mass is zero only for [[Minkowski spacetime]].  The theorem is a [[scalar curvature]] [[comparison theorem]], with asymptotic boundary conditions, and a corresponding statement of geometric [[rigidity (mathematics)|rigidity]].

==Overview==
The original proof of the theorem for [[ADM mass]] was provided by [[Richard Schoen]] and [[Shing-Tung Yau]] in 1979 using [[variational methods]].  [[Edward Witten]] gave another proof in 1981 based on the use of [[spinor]]s, inspired by positive energy theorems in the context of [[supergravity]].  An extension of the theorem for the [[Bondi mass]] was given by [[Malcolm Ludvigsen|Ludvigsen]] and James Vickers, Gary Horowitz and [[Malcolm Perry (physicist)|Malcolm Perry]], and Schoen and Yau.

[[Gary Gibbons]], [[Stephen Hawking]], Horowitz and Perry proved extensions of the theorem to asymptotically [[anti-de Sitter spacetime]]s and to [[Einstein field equations#Einstein–Maxwell equations|Einstein–Maxwell theory]].  The mass of an asymptotically anti-de Sitter spacetime is non-negative and only equal to zero for anti-de Sitter spacetime. In Einstein–Maxwell theory, for a spacetime with [[electric charge]] &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt; and [[magnetic charge]] &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt;, the mass of the spacetime satisfies (in [[Gaussian units]])

:&lt;math&gt;M \geq \sqrt{Q^2 + P^2},&lt;/math&gt;

with equality for the [[Sudhansu Datta Majumdar|Majumdar]]–[[Achilles Papapetrou|Papapetrou]] [[extremal black hole]] solutions.

== Applications ==
* In 1984 Schoen used the positive mass theorem in his work which completed the solution of the [[Yamabe problem]].
* The positive mass theorem was used in [[Hubert Bray]]'s proof of the [[Riemannian Penrose inequality]].

'''''Sea Hero Quest''''' is a mobile game which contributes to research on [[dementia]]. It was designed by British game company [[Glitchers]] in 2016 in association with [[Alzheimer's Research UK]], [[University College London]] and the [[University of East Anglia]] and with funding from [[Deutsche Telekom]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Partners|url=http://www.seaheroquest.com/en/credits|website=Sea Hero Quest|accessdate=5 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="telegraph"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Titcomb|first1=James|title=Playing this smartphone game can help fight dementia|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2016/05/04/playing-this-smartphone-game-can-help-fight-dementia/|accessdate=5 May 2016|work=The Telegraph|date=4 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Home page|url=http://glitchers.com/|publisher=Glitchers|accessdate=5 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The idea for the game came from neuroscientist Michael Hornberger of the University of East Anglia who collaborated with Hugo Spiers of University College London and a group of six other neuroscientists.&lt;ref name="kaplan"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kaplan|first1=Sara|title=Two minutes playing this video game could help scientists fight Alzheimer’s|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/speaking-of-science/wp/2016/05/07/two-minutes-playing-this-video-game-could-help-scientists-fight-alzheimers/|accessdate=8 May 2016|work=Washington Post|date=7 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The game was designed to help researchers to understand the mental process of 3D navigation, which is one of the first skills lost in dementia. It was hoped that a large number of people would play the game, thus contributing much more data than could easily be obtained in a laboratory experiment.&lt;ref name="bbc"&gt;{{cite news|title=Mobile game Sea Hero Quest 'helps dementia research'|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-36203674|accessdate=5 May 2016|work=BBC News|date=4 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The plot of the game involves a sea journey taken by a son in a quest to recover the memories his father has lost to dementia. There are three sections: navigation, shooting flares to test orientation, and chasing creatures.

In [[probability theory]], a [[probability distribution|distribution]] is said to be '''stable''' if a [[linear combination]] of two [[Independence (probability theory)|independent]] [[random variable]]s with this distribution has the same distribution, [[up to]] [[location parameter|location]] and [[scale parameter|scale]] parameters. A random variable is said to be '''stable''' if its distribution is stable. The stable distribution family is also sometimes referred to as the '''Lévy alpha-stable distribution''', after [[Paul Lévy (mathematician)|Paul Lévy]], the first mathematician to have studied it.&lt;ref name="BM 1960"&gt;B. Mandelbrot, The Pareto–Lévy Law and the Distribution of Income, International Economic Review 1960 https://www.jstor.org/stable/2525289&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Paul Lévy, Calcul des probabilités 1925&lt;/ref&gt;

Of the four parameters defining the family, most attention has been focused on the stability parameter, α (see panel). Stable distributions have 0 &lt; α ≤ 2, with the upper bound corresponding to the [[normal distribution]], and α = 1 to the [[Cauchy distribution]]. The distributions have undefined [[variance]] for α &lt; 2, and undefined [[mean]] for α ≤ 1. The importance of stable probability distributions is that they are "[[attractor]]s" for properly normed sums of independent and identically-distributed ([[iid]]) random variables. The normal distribution defines a family of stable distributions. By the classical [[central limit theorem]] the properly normed sum of a set of random variables, each with finite variance, will tend towards a normal distribution as the number of variables increases. Without the finite variance assumption, the limit may be a stable distribution that is not normal.  [[Benoit Mandelbrot|Mandelbrot]] referred to such distributions as "stable Paretian distributions",&lt;ref&gt;B.Mandelbrot, Stable Paretian Random Functions and the Multiplicative Variation of Income, Econometrica 1961 https://www.jstor.org/stable/pdfplus/1911802.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;B. Mandelbrot, The variation of certain Speculative Prices, The Journal of Business 1963 [http://web.williams.edu/Mathematics/sjmiller/public_html/341Fa09/econ/Mandelbroit_VariationCertainSpeculativePrices.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Eugene F. Fama, Mandelbrot and the Stable Paretian Hypothesis, The Journal of Business 1963&lt;/ref&gt; after [[Vilfredo Pareto]]. In particular, he referred to those maximally skewed in the positive direction with 1&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;α&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;2 as "Pareto–Lévy distributions",&lt;ref name="BM 1960"/&gt; which he regarded as better descriptions of stock and commodity prices than normal distributions.&lt;ref name="BM 1963"&gt;Mandelbrot, B., New methods in statistical economics [[The Journal of Political Economy]], 71 #5, 421–440 (1963).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition==
A non-[[degenerate distribution]] is a stable distribution if it satisfies the following property:

:Let ''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''X''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; be independent copies of a [[random variable]] ''X''. Then ''X'' is said to be '''stable''' if for any constants ''a'' &gt; 0 and ''b'' &gt; 0 the random variable ''aX''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + ''bX''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; has the same distribution as ''cX'' + ''d'' for some constants ''c'' &gt; 0 and ''d''. The distribution is said to be ''strictly stable'' if this holds with ''d'' = 0.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://academic2.american.edu/~jpnolan/stable/chap1.pdf|title = Stable Distributions – Models for Heavy Tailed Data|date = |accessdate = 2009-02-21|website = |publisher = |last = Nolan|first = John P.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the [[normal distribution]], the [[Cauchy distribution]], and the [[Lévy distribution]] all have the above property, it follows that they are special cases of stable distributions.

Such distributions form a four-parameter family of continuous [[probability distribution]]s parametrized by location and scale parameters μ and ''c'', respectively, and two shape parameters β and α, roughly corresponding to measures of asymmetry and concentration, respectively (see the figures).

Although the probability density function for a general stable distribution cannot be written analytically, the general characteristic function can be. Any probability distribution is given by the [[Fourier transform]] of its probability density function, or simply its [[Characteristic function (probability theory)|characteristic function]] φ(''t'') by&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.randomservices.org/random/special/Stable.html|title=Stable Distributions|last=Siegrist|first=Kyle|website=www.randomservices.org|language=en|access-date=2018-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt; f(x)=\frac{1}{2\pi}\int_{-\infty}^\infty \varphi(t)e^{-ixt}\,dt &lt;/math&gt;

A random variable ''X'' is called stable if its characteristic function can be written as&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Statistical Mechanics of Financial Markets – Springer|url = https://link.springer.com/10.1007/b137351|doi = 10.1007/b137351|last = Voit|first = Johannes|publisher = Springer|year = 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

: &lt;math&gt; \varphi(t;\alpha,\beta,c,\mu) =  \exp\left (it\mu - |c t|^\alpha \left (1- i \beta\sgn(t)\Phi \right ) \right ) &lt;/math&gt;

where sgn(''t'') is just the [[sign function|sign]] of ''t'' and

:&lt;math&gt;\Phi= \begin{cases} \tan \left (\frac{\pi \alpha}{2} \right) &amp; \alpha \neq 1 \\ -\frac{2}{\pi}\log|t| &amp; \alpha = 1 \end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;

μ ∈ '''R'''  is a shift parameter, β ∈ [−1, 1], called the ''skewness parameter'', is a measure of asymmetry. Notice that in this context the usual [[skewness]] is not well defined, as for α &lt; 2 the distribution does not admit 2nd or higher [[moment (mathematics)|moments]], and the usual skewness definition is the 3rd [[central moment]].

The reason this gives a stable distribution is that the characteristic function for the sum of two random variables equals the product of the two corresponding characteristic functions. Adding two random variables from a stable distribution gives something with the same values of α and β, but possibly different values of μ and ''c''.

Not every function is the characteristic function of a legitimate probability distribution (that is, one whose cumulative distribution function is real and goes from 0 to 1 without decreasing), but the characteristic functions given above will be legitimate so long as the parameters are in their ranges. The value of the characteristic function at some value ''t'' is the complex conjugate of its value at −''t'' as it should be so that the probability distribution function will be real.

In the simplest case β = 0, the characteristic function is just a [[stretched exponential function]]; the  distribution is symmetric about μ and is referred to as a (Lévy) '''symmetric alpha-stable distribution''', often abbreviated ''SαS''.

When α &lt; 1 and β = 1, the distribution is supported by [μ, ∞).

The parameter ''c'' &gt; 0 is a scale factor which is a measure of the width of the distribution while α is the exponent or index of the distribution and specifies the asymptotic behavior of the distribution.

=== Parametrizations ===
The above definition is only one of the parametrizations in use for stable distributions; it is the most common but is not continuous in the parameters at {{math|''α'' {{=}} 1}}.

A continuous parametrization  is&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
: &lt;math&gt; \varphi(t;\alpha,\beta,\gamma,\delta)=\exp\left (it\delta-|\gamma t|^\alpha \left (1-i\beta \sgn(t)\Phi \right ) \right ) &lt;/math&gt;

where:

:&lt;math&gt;\Phi= \begin{cases} \left (|\gamma t|^{1-\alpha}-1 \right )\tan \left (\tfrac{\pi \alpha}{2} \right )  &amp; \alpha \neq 1 \\  -\frac{2}{\pi}\log|\gamma t| &amp; \alpha = 1 \end{cases} &lt;/math&gt;

The ranges of α and β are the same as before, γ (like ''c'') should be positive, and δ (like μ) should be real.

In either parametrization one can make a linear transformation of the random variable to get a random variable whose density is &lt;math&gt;f(y;\alpha,\beta,1,0)&lt;/math&gt;. In the first parametrization, this is done by defining the new variable:

:&lt;math&gt; y= \begin{cases} \frac{x-\mu}\gamma &amp; \alpha \neq 1 \\  \frac{x-\mu}\gamma-\beta\frac 2\pi\ln\gamma  &amp; \alpha = 1 \end{cases} &lt;/math&gt;

For the second parametrization, we simply use

:&lt;math&gt; y=\frac{x-\delta}\gamma.&lt;/math&gt;

no matter what α is. In the first parametrization, if the mean exists (that is, {{math|''α'' &gt; 1}}) then it is equal to μ, whereas in the second parametrization when the mean exists it is equal to &lt;math&gt;\delta-\beta\gamma\tan \left (\tfrac{\pi\alpha}{2} \right).&lt;/math&gt;

===The distribution===
A stable distribution is therefore specified by the above four parameters. It can be shown that any non-degenerate stable distribution has a smooth (infinitely differentiable) density function.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; If &lt;math&gt;f(x;\alpha, \beta,c,\mu)&lt;/math&gt; denotes the density of ''X'' and ''Y'' is the sum of independent copies of ''X'':

:&lt;math&gt;Y = \sum_{i=1}^N k_i (X_i-\mu)\,&lt;/math&gt;

then ''Y'' has the density &lt;math&gt;s^{-1}f(y/s;\alpha,\beta,c,0)&lt;/math&gt; with

:&lt;math&gt;s=\left(\sum_{i=1}^N |k_i|^\alpha\right)^{\frac{1}{\alpha}}.&lt;/math&gt;

The asymptotic behavior is described, for α&lt; 2, by:&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;f(x)\sim\frac{1}{|x|^{1+\alpha}}  \left (c^\alpha (1+\sgn(x)\beta) \sin \left (\frac{\pi \alpha}{2} \right )\frac{\Gamma(\alpha+1) }{\pi} \right ) &lt;/math&gt;

where Γ is the [[Gamma function]] (except that when ''α'' &amp;ge; 1 and ''β'' = ±1, the tail does not vanish to the left or right, resp., of ''μ'', although the above expression is 0). This "[[heavy tail]]" behavior causes the variance of stable distributions to be infinite for all α &lt; 2. This property is illustrated in the log-log plots below.

When ''α'' = 2, the distribution is Gaussian (see below), with tails asymptotic to exp(−''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/4''c''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)/(2c√π).

== One-sided stable distribution and stable count distribution ==
When α &lt; 1 and β = 1, the distribution is supported by [μ, ∞). This family is called "one-sided stable distribution".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Penson|first=K. A.|last2=Górska|first2=K.|date=2010-11-17|title=Exact and Explicit Probability Densities for One-Sided L\'evy Stable Distributions|url=https://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevLett.105.210604|journal=Physical Review Letters|volume=105|issue=21|pages=210604|doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.105.210604|arxiv=1007.0193|bibcode=2010PhRvL.105u0604P}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its standard distribution is denoted as
:&lt;math&gt;L_\alpha(x)=f(x;\alpha,1,\cos(\frac{\pi\alpha}{2})^{1/\alpha},0)&lt;/math&gt;, where  &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;1&lt;/math&gt;.

Consider the Lévy sum &lt;math&gt;Y = \sum_{i=1}^N X_i&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;X_i\sim L_\alpha(x)&lt;/math&gt;, then ''Y'' has the density &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{\nu}L_\alpha(\frac{x}{\nu})&lt;/math&gt;  where &lt;math&gt;\nu=N^{1/\alpha}&lt;/math&gt;. Set &lt;math&gt;x=1&lt;/math&gt;, we arrive at the "stable count distribution".&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Its standard distribution is defined as

:&lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{N}_\alpha(\nu)=\frac{\alpha}{\Gamma(\frac{1}{\alpha})} \frac{1}{\nu} L_\alpha(\frac{1}{\nu})
&lt;/math&gt;, where  &lt;math&gt;\nu&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;1&lt;/math&gt;.

The stable count distribution is the conjugate prior of the one-sided stable distribution. Its location-scale family is defined as

:&lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{N}_\alpha(\nu;\nu_0,\theta)= \frac{\alpha}{\Gamma(\frac{1}{\alpha})} 
\frac{1}{\nu-\nu_0} L_\alpha(\frac{\theta}{\nu-\nu_0})
&lt;/math&gt;, where  &lt;math&gt;\nu&gt;\nu_0&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\theta&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;1&lt;/math&gt;.

It is also a one-sided distribution supported by &lt;math&gt;[\nu_0,\infty)
&lt;/math&gt;. The location parameter &lt;math&gt;\nu_0
&lt;/math&gt; is the cut-off location, while &lt;math&gt;\theta
&lt;/math&gt;  defines the scale of the one-sided distribution.

When &lt;math&gt;\alpha=\frac{1}{2}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;L_{\frac{1}{2}}(x)&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Lévy distribution]] which is an inverse gamma distribution. Thus &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{N}_{\frac{1}{2}}(\nu;\nu_0,\theta)
&lt;/math&gt; is a shifted [[gamma distribution]] of shape 3/2 and scale &lt;math&gt;4\theta
&lt;/math&gt;,

:&lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{N}_{\frac{1}{2}}(\nu;\nu_0,\theta)= 
\frac{1}{4\sqrt{\pi}\theta^{3/2}} 
(\nu-\nu_0)^{1/2} e^{-\frac{\nu-\nu_0}{4\theta}}
&lt;/math&gt;, where  &lt;math&gt;\nu&gt;\nu_0&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\theta&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;.

Its mean is &lt;math&gt;\nu_0+6\theta
&lt;/math&gt; and its standard deviation is &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{24}\theta
&lt;/math&gt;. It is hypothesized that [[VIX]] is distributed like &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{N}_{\frac{1}{2}}(\nu;\nu_0,\theta)
&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;\nu_0=10.4
&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\theta=1.6
&lt;/math&gt; (See Section 7 of &lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;). Thus the stable count distribution is the first-order marginal distribution of a volatility process. In this context, &lt;math&gt;\nu_0
&lt;/math&gt; is called the "floor volatility".

Another approach to derive the stable count distribution is to use the Laplace transform of the one-sided stable distribution, (Section 2.4 of &lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;)

:&lt;math&gt;\int_{0}^{\infty} e^{-z x} L_\alpha(x) dx = e^{-z^\alpha}&lt;/math&gt;, where  &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;1&lt;/math&gt;.

Let &lt;math&gt;x=1/\nu&lt;/math&gt;, and one can decompose the integral on the left hand side as a [[product distribution]] of a standard [[Laplace distribution]] and a standard stable count distribution,

:&lt;math&gt;\int_{0}^{\infty} \left ( \frac{1}{2\nu} e^{-\frac{|z|}{\nu} }\right )
\left (\frac{\alpha}{\Gamma(\frac{1}{\alpha})}  \frac{1}{\nu} L_\alpha(\frac{1}{\nu}) \right ) d \nu 
= \frac{1}{2} \frac{\alpha}{\Gamma(\frac{1}{\alpha})} e^{-|z|^\alpha}&lt;/math&gt;, where  &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;1&lt;/math&gt;.

This is called the "lambda decomposition" (See Section 4 of &lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;) since the right hand side was named as "symmetric lambda distribution" in Lihn's former works. However, it has several more popular names such as "[[exponential power distribution]]", or the "generalized error/normal distribution", often referred to when α &gt; 1'''.'''

The n-th moment of &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{N}_\alpha(\nu)
&lt;/math&gt; is the &lt;math&gt;-(n+1)
&lt;/math&gt;-th moment of &lt;math&gt;L_\alpha(x)&lt;/math&gt;, All positive moments are finite. This in a way solves the thorny issue of diverging moments in the stable distribution.

== Properties ==
* All stable distributions are [[infinitely divisible distribution|infinitely divisible]].
* With the exception of the [[normal distribution]] (α = 2), stable distributions are [[leptokurtotic]] and [[heavy-tailed distribution]]s.
* Closure under convolution

Stable distributions are closed under convolution for a fixed value of α. Since convolution is equivalent to multiplication of the Fourier-transformed function, it follows that the product of two stable characteristic functions with the same α will yield another such characteristic function. The product of two stable characteristic functions is given by:

:&lt;math&gt;\exp\left (it\mu_1+it\mu_2 - |c_1 t|^\alpha - |c_2 t|^\alpha +i\beta_1|c_1 t|^\alpha\sgn(t)\Phi +i\beta_2|c_2 t|^\alpha\sgn(t)\Phi \right )&lt;/math&gt;

Since Φ is not a function of the μ, ''c'' or β variables it follows that these parameters for the convolved function are given by:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\mu &amp;=\mu_1+\mu_2 \\
|c|  &amp;= \left (|c_1|^\alpha+|c_2|^\alpha \right )^{\frac{1}{\alpha}} \\[6pt]
\beta &amp;= \frac{\beta_1 |c_1|^\alpha+\beta_2|c_2|^\alpha}{|c_1|^\alpha+|c_2|^\alpha}
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

In each case, it can be shown that the resulting parameters lie within the required intervals for a stable distribution.

== A generalized central limit theorem ==
Another important property of stable distributions is the role that they play in a generalized [[central limit theorem]]. The central limit theorem states that the sum of a number of independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) random variables with finite non-zero variances will tend to a [[normal distribution]] as the number of variables grows.

A generalization due to [[Boris Vladimirovich Gnedenko|Gnedenko]] and [[Andrey Nikolaevich Kolmogorov|Kolmogorov]] states that the sum of a number of random variables with symmetric distributions having power-law tails ([[Pareto distribution|Paretian tail]]s), decreasing as &lt;math&gt;|x|^{-\alpha-1}&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;0 &lt; \alpha \leqslant 2&lt;/math&gt; (and therefore having infinite variance), will tend to a stable distribution &lt;math&gt;f(x;\alpha,0,c,0)&lt;/math&gt; as the number of summands grows.&lt;ref&gt;B.V. Gnedenko, A.N. Kolmogorov. Limit distributions for sums of independent random variables, Cambridge, Addison-Wesley 1954 https://books.google.com/books/about/Limit_distributions_for_sums_of_independ.html?id=rYsZAQAAIAAJ&amp;redir_esc=y&lt;/ref&gt; If &lt;math&gt;\alpha &gt; 2&lt;/math&gt; then the sum converges to a stable distribution with stability parameter equal to 2, i.e. a Gaussian distribution.&lt;ref&gt;Vladimir V. Uchaikin, Vladimir M. Zolotarev, Chance and Stability: Stable Distributions and their Applications, De Gruyter 1999 https://books.google.com/books/about/Chance_and_Stability.html?id=Y0xiwAmkb_oC&amp;redir_esc=y&lt;/ref&gt;

There are other possibilities as well. For example, if the characteristic function of the random variable is asymptotic to &lt;math&gt;1+a|t|^\alpha\ln|t|&lt;/math&gt; for small ''t'' (positive or negative), then we may ask how ''t'' varies with ''n'' when the value of the characteristic function for the sum of ''n'' such random variables equals a given value ''u'':

:&lt;math&gt;\varphi_\text{sum}=\varphi^n=u&lt;/math&gt;

Assuming for the moment that ''t'' → 0, we take the limit of the above as {{math|''n'' → ∞}}:

:&lt;math&gt; \ln u =\lim_{n\to\infty} n\ln\varphi =\lim_{n\to\infty} na|t|^\alpha\ln|t|.&lt;/math&gt;

Therefore:

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\ln(\ln u) &amp; = \ln \left ( \lim_{n\to\infty} na|t|^\alpha\ln|t| \right ) \\[5pt]
&amp; = \lim_{n\to\infty}\ln \left (  na|t|^\alpha\ln|t|  \right ) =  \lim_{n\to\infty} \left \{ \ln(na)+\alpha\ln|t|+\ln (\ln |t|) \right \}
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

This shows that &lt;math&gt;\ln|t|&lt;/math&gt; is asymptotic to &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{-1}{\alpha}\ln n,&lt;/math&gt; so using the previous equation we have

:&lt;math&gt;|t|\sim  \left ( \frac{-\alpha \ln u}{na\ln n} \right )^{1/\alpha}.&lt;/math&gt;

This implies that the sum divided by

:&lt;math&gt;\left ( \frac{na \ln n}{\alpha} \right ) ^{\frac{1}{\alpha}}&lt;/math&gt;

has a characteristic function whose value at some ''t′'' goes to ''u'' (as ''n'' increases) when &lt;math&gt;t'=(-\ln u)^{\frac{1}{\alpha}}.&lt;/math&gt; In other words, the characteristic function converges pointwise to &lt;math&gt;\exp(-(t')^\alpha)&lt;/math&gt; and therefore by [[Lévy's continuity theorem]] the sum divided by

:&lt;math&gt;\left ( \frac{na \ln n}{\alpha} \right ) ^{\frac{1}{\alpha}}&lt;/math&gt;

[[converges in distribution]] to the symmetric alpha-stable distribution with stability parameter &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; and scale parameter 1.

This can be applied to a random variable whose tails decrease as &lt;math&gt;|x|^{-3}&lt;/math&gt;. This random variable has a mean but the variance is infinite. Let us take the following distribution:

:&lt;math&gt;f(x)=\begin{cases}
\frac 13 &amp; |x|\leqslant 1 \\
\frac 13x^{-3} &amp; |x|&gt;1
\end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;

We can write this as

:&lt;math&gt;f(x)=\int_1^\infty\frac 2{w^4} h \left (\frac{x}{w} \right ) dw&lt;/math&gt;

where

:&lt;math&gt;h \left (\frac{x}{w} \right )
=\begin{cases}
\frac 12 &amp; \left|\frac x w\right|&lt;1, \\
0 &amp; \left|\frac x w\right|&gt;1.
\end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;

We want to find the leading terms of the asymptotic expansion of the characteristic function. The characteristic function of the probability distribution &lt;math&gt;\tfrac {1}{w} h\left(\tfrac xw\right)&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{\sin(tw)}{tw},&lt;/math&gt; so the characteristic function for ''f''(''x'') is

:&lt;math&gt;\varphi(t)=\int_1^\infty\frac{2\sin(tw)}{tw^4}dw&lt;/math&gt;

and we can calculate:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\varphi(t)-1 &amp;=\int_1^\infty\frac 2 {w^3} \left[\frac{\sin(tw)}{tw} -1 \right] \,dw \\
&amp;= \int_1^{\frac{1}{|t|}} \frac 2 {w^3} \left[\frac{\sin(tw)}{tw} -1 \right] \,dw + \int_{\frac{1}{|t|}}^{\infty} \frac 2 {w^3} \left[\frac{\sin(tw)}{tw} -1 \right] \,dw \\
&amp;= \int_1^{\frac{1}{|t|}} \frac 2 {w^3} \left[\frac{\sin(tw)}{tw} -1 + \left \{ -\frac{t^2w^2}{3!} + \frac{t^2w^2}{3!} \right \} \right] \,dw +  \int_{\frac{1}{|t|}}^{\infty} \frac 2 {w^3} \left[\frac{\sin(tw)}{tw} -1 \right] \,dw \\
&amp;= \int_1^{\frac{1}{|t|}} -\frac{t^2dw}{3w} + \int_1^{\frac{1}{|t|}} \frac 2 {w^3} \left[\frac{\sin(tw)}{tw} -1 + \frac{t^2w^2}{3!} \right] dw +\int_{\frac{1}{|t|}}^{\infty} \frac 2 {w^3} \left[\frac{\sin(tw)}{tw} -1 \right] dw \\
&amp;= \int_1^{\frac{1}{|t|}} -\frac{t^2dw}{3w} + \left \{ \int_0^{\frac{1}{|t|}} \frac 2 {w^3} \left[\frac{\sin(tw)}{tw} -1 + \frac{t^2w^2}{3!} \right] dw - \int_0^1 \frac 2 {w^3} \left[\frac{\sin(tw)}{tw} -1 + \frac{t^2w^2}{3!} \right] dw \right \} +\int_{\frac{1}{|t|}}^{\infty} \frac 2 {w^3} \left[\frac{\sin(tw)}{tw} -1 \right] dw \\
&amp;= \int_1^{\frac{1}{|t|}} -\frac{t^2dw}{3w} +t^2\int_0^1\frac 2{y^3}\left[\frac{\sin(y)}{y}-1+\frac{y^2}6\right]dy -\int_0^1\frac 2{w^3}\left[\frac{\sin(tw)}{tw}-1+\frac{t^2w^2}6\right]dw +t^2\int_1^\infty\frac 2{y^3}\left[\frac{\sin(y)}y-1\right]dy \\
&amp;= -\frac{t^2}{3} \int_1^{\frac{1}{|t|}} \frac{dw}{w} + t^2 C_1 - \int_0^1\frac 2{w^3}\left[\frac{\sin(tw)}{tw}-1+\frac{t^2w^2}6\right]dw + t^2 C_2 \\
&amp;= \frac{t^2}3\ln|t| + t^2 C_3 - \int_0^1\frac 2{w^3}\left[\frac{\sin(tw)}{tw}-1+\frac{t^2w^2}6\right]dw \\
&amp;= \frac{t^2}3\ln|t| + t^2 C_3 - \int_0^1\frac 2{w^3}\left[ \frac{t^4w^4}{5!} + \cdots \right ] dw \\
&amp;= \frac{t^2}3\ln|t| + t^2 C_3 - \mathcal{O} \left ( t^4 \right )
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;C_1, C_2&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;C_3&lt;/math&gt; are constants. Therefore,

:&lt;math&gt;\varphi(t)\sim 1+ \frac{t^2}{3}\ln|t|&lt;/math&gt;

and according to what was said above (and the fact that the variance of ''f''(''x'';2,0,1,0) is 2), the sum of ''n'' instances of this random variable, divided by &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{n(\ln n)/12},&lt;/math&gt; will converge in distribution to a Gaussian distribution with variance 1. But the variance at any particular ''n'' will still be infinite. Note that the width of the limiting distribution grows faster than in the case where the random variable has a finite variance (in which case the width grows as the square root of ''n''). The '''average''', obtained by dividing the sum by ''n'', tends toward a Gaussian whose width approaches zero as ''n'' increases, in accordance with the [[Law of large numbers]].

==Special cases==

[[Image:Levyskew LdistributionPDF.png|325px|left|thumb|Log-log plot of skewed centered stable distribution PDF's showing the power law behavior for large ''x''. Again the slope of the linear portions is equal to −(α+1)]]

There is no general analytic solution for the form of ''p''(''x''). There are, however three special cases which can be expressed in terms of [[elementary functions]] as can be seen by inspection of the [[Characteristic function (probability theory)|characteristic function]]:&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Stable Non-Gaussian Random Processes: Stochastic Models with Infinite Variance|last = Samorodnitsky|first = G.|publisher = CRC Press|year = 1994|isbn = 9780412051715|location = |pages = |url = https://www.crcpress.com/Stable-Non-Gaussian-Random-Processes-Stochastic-Models-with-Infinite-Variance/Samoradnitsky-Taqqu/9780412051715|last2 = Taqqu|first2 = M.S.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* For α = 2 the distribution reduces to a [[Gaussian distribution]] with variance σ&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 2''c''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; and mean μ; the skewness parameter β has no effect.
* For α = 1 and β = 0 the distribution reduces to a [[Cauchy distribution]] with scale parameter ''c'' and shift parameter μ.
* For α = 1/2 and β = 1 the distribution reduces to a [[Lévy distribution]] with scale parameter ''c'' and shift parameter μ.

Note that the above three distributions are also connected, in the following way: A standard Cauchy random variable can be viewed as a [[Compound probability distribution|mixture]] of Gaussian random variables (all with mean zero), with the variance being drawn from a standard Lévy distribution. And in fact this is a special case of a more general theorem &lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://ssrn.com/abstract=3046732|title=A Theory of Asset Return and Volatility Under Stable Law and Stable Lambda Distribution|last=Lihn|first=Stephen|publisher=SSRN|year=2017|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; which allows any symmetric alpha-stable distribution to be viewed in this way (with the alpha parameter of the mixture distribution equal to twice the alpha parameter of the mixing distribution—and the beta parameter of the mixing distribution always equal to one).

A general closed form expression for stable PDF's with rational values of α is available in terms of [[Meijer G-function]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = On Representation of Densities of Stable Laws by Special Functions|url = http://epubs.siam.org/doi/abs/10.1137/1139025|journal = Theory of Probability &amp; Its Applications|date = 1995|issn = 0040-585X|pages = 354–362|volume = 39|issue = 2|doi = 10.1137/1139025|first = V.|last = Zolotarev}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fox H-Functions can also be used to express the stable probability density functions. For simple rational numbers, the closed form expression is often in terms of less complicated [[special functions]]. Several closed form expressions having rather simple expressions in terms of special functions are available. In the table below, PDF's expressible by elementary functions are indicated by an ''E'' and those that are expressible by special functions are indicated by an ''s''.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Some of the special cases are known by particular names:

* For α = 1 and β = 1, the distribution is a [[Landau distribution]] which has a specific usage in physics under this name.
* For α = 3/2 and β = 0 the distribution reduces to a [[Holtsmark distribution]] with scale parameter ''c'' and shift parameter μ.

Also, in the limit as ''c'' approaches zero or as α approaches zero the distribution will approach a [[Dirac delta function]] δ(''x''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;μ).

==Series representation==
The stable distribution can be restated as the real part of a simpler integral:&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Theory of the pressure broadening and shift of spectral lines|url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00018738100101467|journal = Advances in Physics|date = 1981|issn = 0001-8732|pages = 367–474|volume = 30|issue = 3|doi = 10.1080/00018738100101467|first = G.|last = Peach}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;f(x;\alpha,\beta,c,\mu)=\frac{1}{\pi}\Re\left[ \int_0^\infty e^{it(x-\mu)}e^{-(ct)^\alpha(1-i\beta\Phi)}\,dt\right].&lt;/math&gt;

Expressing the second exponential as a [[Taylor series]], we have:

:&lt;math&gt;f(x;\alpha,\beta,c,\mu)=\frac{1}{\pi}\Re\left[ \int_0^\infty e^{it(x-\mu)}\sum_{n=0}^\infty\frac{(-qt^\alpha)^n}{n!}\,dt\right]&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;q=c^\alpha(1-i\beta\Phi)&lt;/math&gt;. Reversing the order of integration and summation, and carrying out the integration yields:

:&lt;math&gt;f(x;\alpha,\beta,c,\mu)=\frac{1}{\pi}\Re\left[ \sum_{n=1}^\infty\frac{(-q)^n}{n!}\left(\frac{i}{x-\mu}\right)^{\alpha n+1}\Gamma(\alpha n+1)\right]&lt;/math&gt;

which will be valid for ''x'' ≠ μ and will converge for appropriate values of the parameters. (Note that the ''n'' = 0 term which yields a [[Dirac delta function|delta function]] in ''x''−μ has therefore been dropped.) Expressing the first exponential as a series will yield another series in positive powers of ''x''−μ which is generally less useful.

== Simulation of stable variables ==
Simulating sequences of stable random variables is not straightforward, since there are no analytic expressions for the inverse &lt;math&gt;F^{-1}(x)&lt;/math&gt; nor the CDF &lt;math&gt;F(x)&lt;/math&gt; itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Numerical calculation of stable densities and distribution functions|url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/15326349708807450|journal = Communications in Statistics.

Given the formulas for simulation of a standard stable random variable, we can easily simulate a stable random variable for all admissible values of the parameters &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; using the following property.

:&lt;math&gt;Y=\begin{cases} c X+\mu &amp; \alpha \ne 1 \\ c X+\frac{2}{\pi}\beta c\log c + \mu &amp; \alpha=1\end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;

is &lt;math&gt;S_\alpha(\beta,c,\mu)&lt;/math&gt;. For &lt;math&gt;\alpha=2&lt;/math&gt; (and &lt;math&gt;\beta=0&lt;/math&gt;) the CMS method reduces to the well known [[Box–Muller transform|Box-Muller transform]] for generating [[Normal distribution|Gaussian]] random variables.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Simulation and Chaotic Behavior of Alpha-stable Stochastic Processes|last = Janicki|first = Aleksander|publisher = CRC Press|year = 1994|isbn = 9780824788827|location = |pages = |url = https://www.crcpress.com/Simulation-and-Chaotic-Behavior-of-Alpha-stable-Stochastic-Processes/Janicki-Weron/9780824788827|last2 = Weron|first2 = Aleksander}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many other approaches have been proposed in the literature, including application of Bergström and LePage series expansions, see &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Fast, accurate algorithm for numerical simulation of L\'evy stable stochastic processes|url = http://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevE.49.4677|journal = Physical Review E|date = 1994|pages = 4677–4683|volume = 49|issue = 5|doi = 10.1103/PhysRevE.49.4677|first = Rosario Nunzio|last = Mantegna|bibcode = 1994PhRvE..49.4677M}}&lt;/ref&gt; and,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Computer investigation of the Rate of Convergence of Lepage Type Series to α-Stable Random Variables|url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02331889208802383|journal = Statistics|date = 1992|issn = 0233-1888|pages = 365–373|volume = 23|issue = 4|doi = 10.1080/02331889208802383|first = Aleksander|last = Janicki|first2 = Piotr|last2 = Kokoszka}}&lt;/ref&gt; respectively.

== Applications ==
Stable distributions owe their importance in both theory and practice to the generalization of the [[central limit theorem]] to random variables without second (and possibly first) order [[moment (mathematics)|moments]] and the accompanying [[self-similarity]] of the stable family. It was the seeming departure from normality along with the demand for a self-similar model for financial data (i.e. the shape of the distribution for yearly asset price changes should resemble that of the constituent daily or monthly price changes) that led [[Benoît Mandelbrot]] to propose that cotton prices follow an alpha-stable distribution with α equal to 1.7.&lt;ref name="BM 1963"/&gt; [[Lévy distribution]]s are frequently found in analysis of [[critical behavior]] and financial data.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Stable Paretian Models in Finance|last = Rachev|first = Svetlozar T.|publisher = Wiley|year = 2000|isbn = 978-0-471-95314-2|location = |pages = |url = http://eu.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-0471953148.html|last2 = Mittnik|first2 = Stefan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Lévy distribution of solar flare waiting time events (time between flare events) was demonstrated for [[CGRO]] BATSE hard x-ray solar flares in December 2001. Analysis of the Lévy statistical signature revealed that two different memory signatures were evident; one related to the solar cycle and the second whose origin appears to be associated with a localized or combination of localized solar active region effects.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.library.unt.edu/theses/open/20013/leddon_deborah/dissertation.pdf Leddon, D., A statistical Study of Hard X-Ray Solar Flares]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Other analytic cases ==

A number of cases of analytically expressible stable distributions are known. Let the stable distribution be expressed by &lt;math&gt;f(x;\alpha,\beta,c,\mu)&lt;/math&gt; then we know:

* The [[Cauchy Distribution]] is given by &lt;math&gt;f(x;1,0,1,0).&lt;/math&gt;
* The [[Lévy distribution]] is given by &lt;math&gt;f(x;\tfrac{1}{2},-1,1,0).&lt;/math&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11615">'''Strip-till''' is a conservation system that uses a [[minimum tillage]]. It combines the soil drying and warming benefits of conventional tillage with the soil-protecting advantages of no-till by disturbing only the portion of the soil that is to contain the seed row.&lt;ref name=colostate&gt;{{cite web|last=Brown|first=Eric|title=Conservation Tillage Field Day at ARDEC |url=http://www.ext.colostate.edu/pubs/water/news-cons-tillage.html|publisher=Colorado State University Extension|accessdate=9 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; This type of tillage is performed with special equipment&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=CONSERVATION PRACTICE DEFINITIONS AND THEIR CORRESPONDING POTENTIAL TO ADVERSELY IMPACT CULTURAL RESOURCES |url=http://efotg.nrcs.usda.gov/references/public/TN/PracticeDecisionWorksheet(matrix).pdf|work=Natural Resources Conservation Service |publisher=U.S. Department of Agriculture|accessdate=9 November 2013|pages=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; and can require the farmer to make multiple trips,&lt;ref name=colostate /&gt; depending on the strip-till implement used, and field conditions. Each row that has been strip-tilled is usually about eight to ten inches wide.&lt;ref name=colostate /&gt;

==Challenges of both Strip-till and No-till systems==
In reduced tillage strategies, weed suppression can be difficult. In place of cultivation, a farmer can suppress weeds by managing a [[cover crop]], mowing, crimping, or herbicide application.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Indiana Job Sheet (340)|edition=ver. 1.3 |url=http://efotg.sc.egov.usda.gov/references/public/IN/340_Job_Sheet.docx|publisher=U.S. Department of Agriculture|accessdate=9 November 2013 |location=Section with the heading "Operation and Maintenance" and "Termination"|format=docx|date=October 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The purchase of mowing and crimping implements may represent an unjust expenditure. Additionally, finding an appropriate cover crop mix for adequate weed suppression may be difficult. Also, without mowing or crimping implements it may not be possible to achieve a kill on the cover crop. If mowing, crimping, and suppression with a cover crop mixture fail, herbicides can be applied. However, this may represent an increase in total farm expenses due to herbicides being used in place of cultivation for weed suppression.

There are some disadvantages specific to strip-till systems. Some farmers may not be able to strip-till if there is an early freeze. Though strip tillage can be successful without a global position system (GPS) based guidance, it can be beneficial.&lt;ref name="STC p2"/&gt; Lastly, strip-till systems requires a high-horsepower tractor; however, the energy requirement is less than with conventional tillage systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wrc.umn.edu/prod/groups/cfans/%40pub/%40cfans/%40wrc/documents/asset/cfans_asset_123091.pdf |title=Strip-Tillage Option for Continuous Corn |publisher=ISU}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Strip Till for Field Crop Production |url=http://www.ag.ndsu.edu/pubs/ageng/machine/ae1370.pdf |publisher=North Dakota State University}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Differences in the equipment used==
No-till planters have a disk opener and/or coulter that is located in front of the planting unit.&lt;ref name=OK_Extension&gt;{{cite web |title=No-Till Cropping Systems in Oklahoma|url=http://www.extension.org/sites/default/files/Overview%20of%20No-tillage%20Oklahoma.pdf |publisher=Oklahoma Cooperative Extension Service|accessdate=9 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; This coulter is designed to cut through crop residue and into the hard crust of the soil.&lt;ref name=OK_Extension /&gt; After the coulter has broken through the residue and crust, the disk opener of the planting unit slices the soil and the seed is dropped into the furrow that has been created and then a press wheel closes the furrow.&lt;ref name=OK_Extension /&gt;

With strip-tillage systems more precision is needed. At the same time the field is strip-tilled, the fertilizer or chemical may be applied. If the meter of the chemical or fertilizer applicator is off slightly, an accurate rate may not be applied. This could result in increased expenses or reduction of the efficacy of the fertilizer or chemical program.

==Effects on the soils properties==
When oxygen is introduced into the soil via tillage, the decomposition of [[organic matter]] is accelerated. [[Carbon]], [[nitrogen]], and [[phosphorus]] were all higher in the no-till system than on reduced till, and conventional till systems in an Australian study.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Soil and Tillage Research|url=http://geoscience.net/research/013/435/non-till-effects-organic-matter-ph-cation-exchange-capacity-nutrient-distribution-luvisol-semi-arid-subtropics.php| archiveurl=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/journal/01671987/94/2 |work=No-till effects on organic matter, pH, cation exchange capacity and nutrient distribution in a Luvisol in the semi-arid subtropics. |author=Thomas, G.A, |author2=R.C. Dalal |author3=J. Standley|archivedate=11 September 2013|location=Volume 94, Issue 2|pages=295–304 |date=June 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Strip tillage has some similarities with [[no-till]] systems because the surface is protected with residue. However, strip-till also has a similar effect on soil properties as conventional tillage systems because the farmer still breaks the soil’s crust which allows aerobic conditions to speed the decay of organic matter. A two-year study found that strip-till did not affect the amount of soil organic carbon or its extractable phosphorus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/0167-1987(96)01009-4|journal=Soil and Tillage Research |url=http://www.nrel.colostate.edu/ftp/conant/D_Beese//697kingery1996.pdf| archiveurl=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&amp;_udi=B6TC6-3W2YDB4-3&amp;_user=16764&amp;_coverDate=07%2F31%2F1996&amp;_rdoc=1&amp;_fmt=&amp;_orig=search&amp;_sort=d&amp;view=c&amp;_acct=C000001898&amp;_version=1&amp;_urlVersion=0&amp;_userid=16764&amp;md5=9c8a4ff4d484bd6296b090d4550173a1|title=Tillage and amendment effects on soil carbon and nitrogen mineralization and phosphorus release |accessdate=9 November 2013|author=Kingrey, W.

==Impacts on productivity==
In one study, yields were higher in the strip-tilled area than in the area where no-till was practiced. In a low phosphorus site, yield was 43.5 bu/a in strip-till compared to 41.5 bu/a in a no-till system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ipni.net|author=Randall, G.W. |author2=Vetsch, J.A. |author3=Murrel, T.S. |title=Soybean Response to Residual Phosphorus for Various Placements and Tillage Practices |location=Vol. 85, TABLE 1|page=1|format=pdf, also available as a Google cached copy|date=April 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yield is comparable to that of [[Tillage#Intensive tillage|intensive tillage systems]] — without the cost.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Best Management Practices for Conservation/Reduced Tillage |url=http://publications.tamu.edu/WHEAT/PUB_wheat_Best%20Management%20Practices%20for%20Conservation%20Tillage.pdf|publisher=Texas Cooperative Extension, The Texas A&amp;M University System}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Benefits of Strip till==
Strip till warms the soil,&lt;ref name=STC&gt;{{cite web|title=Strip-till Considerations in Oklahoma |url=http://pods.dasnr.okstate.edu/docushare/dsweb/Get/Document-5035/PSS-2134web.pdf|website=pods.dasnr.okstate.edu|publisher=Oklahoma Cooperative Extension Service|accessdate=8 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; it allows an aerobic condition, and it allows for a better seedbed than no-till. Strip-till allows the soil’s nutrients to be better adapted to the plant’s needs, while still giving residue cover to the soil between the rows.&lt;ref name=STC/&gt; The system will still allow for some soil water contact that could cause erosion, however, the amount of erosion on a strip-tilled field would be light compared to the amount of erosion on an intensively tilled field.  Furthermore, when [[liquid fertilizer]] is being applied, it can be directly applied in these rows where the seed is being planted,&lt;ref name="STC p2"&gt;{{cite web|title=Strip-till Considerations in Oklahoma|url=http://pods.dasnr.okstate.edu/docushare/dsweb/Get/Document-5035/PSS-2134web.pdf |work=pods.dasnr.okstate.edu|publisher=Oklahoma Cooperative Extension Service|page=2|accessdate=8 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; reducing the amount of fertilizer needed while improving proximity of the fertilizer to the roots. Compared to intensive tillage, strip tillage saves considerable time and money.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Conservation Tillage Systems |url=http://agecon.okstate.edu/isct/labranza/jasa/tillagesys.doc|work=agecon.okstate.edu|publisher=University of Nebraska|accessdate=8 July 2013|author=Paul J. Jasa|page=Last page, table 2 and 3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Strip tillage can reduce the amount of trips through a field down to two or possibly one trip when using a strip till implement combined with other machinery such as a planter, fertilizer spreader, and chemical sprayer. This can save the farmer a considerable amount of time and fuel, while reducing soil compaction due to few passes in a field.  With the use of [[GPS]]-guided tractors, this [[precision farming]] can increase overall yields.&lt;ref name="STC p3"&gt;{{cite web |title=Strip-till Considerations in Oklahoma|url=http://pods.dasnr.okstate.edu/docushare/dsweb/Get/Document-5035/PSS-2134web.pdf |work=pods.dasnr.okstate.edu|page=3|publisher=Oklahoma Cooperative Extension Service|accessdate=8 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Strip-till conserves more soil moisture compared to intensive tillage systems. However, compared to no-till, strip-till may  in some cases reduce soil moisture.&lt;ref name="STC pp1-2"&gt;{{cite web|title=Strip-till Considerations in Oklahoma |url=http://pods.dasnr.okstate.edu/docushare/dsweb/Get/Document-5035/PSS-2134web.pdf|work=pods.dasnr.okstate.edu|pages=1–2|publisher=Oklahoma Cooperative Extension Service|accessdate=8 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Geochemist's Workbench''' (GWB) is an integrated set of interactive [[Simulation software|software]] tools for solving a range of problems in aqueous [[chemistry]]. The graphical user interface simplifies the use of the [[geochemical code]].

== History ==
The GWB package was originally developed at the Department of [[Geology]] of the [[University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign]] over a period of more than twenty years,&lt;ref&gt;Bethke, C. and Yeakel, S., 2016, ''The Geochemist’s Workbench® Release 11 - GWB Essentials Guide''. https://www.gwb.com/pdf/GWB11/GWBessentials.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; under the sponsorship initially of a consortium of companies and government laboratories and later through license fees paid by a community of users.&lt;ref&gt;Lee, L. and M. Goldhaber, 2011, ''The Geochemist's Workbench Computer Program''. http://crustal.usgs.gov/projects/aqueous_geochemistry/geochemists_workbench.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Heckel, J., March 2012, ''Aqueous Solutions: Solving problems from carbon sequestration to Fukushima''. Central Illinois Business, p. 7&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2011, the GWB development team moved to the Research Park at the University of Illinois, where they operate as an independent company named Aqueous Solutions LLC.&lt;ref name="Bethke"&gt;Bethke, C.M., and S. Yeakel, 2014, ''The Geochemist's Workbench User's Guides'', Version 10.0. Aqueous Solutions LLC, Champaign&lt;/ref&gt; Since its release, over 3,000 copies have been licensed in 64 countries.&lt;ref&gt;Official website http://www.gwb.com/software_overview.php&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, a free Student Edition of the software was released.&lt;ref name = "GWB Student"&gt;Student Edition website http://student.gwb.com/index.php&lt;/ref&gt;

An early version of the software was one of the first applications of [[Parallel computing|parallel]] [[Vector processing|vector computing]], the predecessor to today's [[multi-core processor]]s, to geological research.&lt;ref&gt;Bethke, C.M., W.J. Harrison, C. Upson, and S.P. Altaner, 1988, Supercomputer analysis of sedimentary basins. ''Science'' '''239''', 261-267&lt;/ref&gt; The current release is [[Multithreading (computer architecture)|multithreaded]], and as such retains features of the early parallel vector architecture.&lt;ref&gt;GWB Multithreading page http://www.gwb.com/multithread.php&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview ==
The GWB is an integrated [[geochemical]] [[Computer simulation|modeling]] package used for balancing [[chemical reactions]], calculating stability diagrams and the [[Chemical equilibrium|equilibrium]] states of natural waters, tracing reaction processes, modeling reactive transport, plotting the results of these calculations, and storing the related data.  The Workbench, designed for personal computers running [[MS Windows]], is distributed commercially in three packages: GWB Professional, Standard, and Essentials, as well as in the free [[#Other geochemical modeling programs in common use|GWB Student Edition]].&lt;ref name="NGWA Newszine"&gt;{{cite web|title=Geochemistry Software Made Available for Free to Students|url=http://newsmanager.commpartners.com/ngwanz/issues/2014-08-22/3.html#1|website=www.ngwa.org|publisher=National Ground Water Association|accessdate=22 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

GWB reads datasets of [[thermodynamic]] [[equilibrium constants]] (most commonly compiled from 0 to 300&amp;nbsp;°C along the steam saturation curve) with which it can calculate chemical equilibria. Thermodynamic datasets from other popular programs like PHREEQC,&lt;ref name = "Parkhurst"&gt;Parkhurst, D.L., 1995, User's Guide to PHREEQC, a computer model for speciation, reaction-path, advective-transport and inverse geochemical calculations. US Geological Survey Water-Resources Investigations Report 95-4227.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "Parkhurst and Appelo"&gt;Parkhurst, D.L. and C.A.J. Appelo, 1999, User's Guide to PHREEQC (version 2), a computer program for speciation, batch-reaction, one-dimensional transport and inverse geochemical calculations. US Geological Survey Water-Resources Investigations Report 99-4259.&lt;/ref&gt; WATEQ4F,&lt;ref name = "Ball and Nordstrom"&gt;Ball, J.W. and D.K. Nordstrom, 1991, User's manual for WATEQ4F, with revised thermodynamic data base and test cases for calculating speciation of major, trace, and redox elements in natural waters. US Geological Survey Open File Report 91-183.&lt;/ref&gt; and Visual MINTEQ&lt;ref name = "Visual MINTEQ"&gt;hem.bredband.net/b108693/-VisualMINTEQ_references.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; have been formatted for the GWB, enabling comparison and validation of the different codes.&lt;ref&gt;Gustafsson, J.P., 2010, ''Visual MINTEQ thermodynamic databases in GWB format''. http://www2.lwr.kth.se/English/OurSoftware/vminteq/download.html&lt;/ref&gt; The program K2GWB&lt;ref&gt;Cleverley, J.S. and E.N. Bastrakov, 2005, K2GWB: Utility for generating thermodynamic data files for The Geochemist's Workbench® at 0–1000 °C and 1–5000 bar from UT2K and the UNITHERM database. ''Computers &amp; Geosciences'' '''31''', 756-767&lt;/ref&gt; (log K to GWB) was written to generate thermodynamic data for GWB under pressures and temperatures beyond the limits of the default datasets. The GWB can couple chemical reaction with [[Groundwater model|hydrologic transport]] to produce simulations known as [[Reactive transport modeling in porous media|reactive transport models]]. GWB can calculate flow fields dynamically, or import flow fields as numeric data or calculated directly from the [[USGS]] hydrologic flow code [[MODFLOW]].&lt;ref name="Bethke" /&gt;

== Uses in science and industry ==
[[Geochemistry|Geochemists]] working in the field, office, lab, or classroom store their analyses, calculate the [[Chemical equilibrium|distribution of chemical mass]], create plots and diagrams, evaluate their experiments, and solve real-world problems.

The software is used by [[Environmental chemistry|environmental chemists]], [[Environmental engineering|engineers]], [[Environmental microbiology|microbiologists]], and remediators to gain quantitative understanding of the chemical and microbiological reactions which control the fate and mobility of contaminants in the biosphere. With this knowledge, they can develop predictive models of contaminant fate and transport, and test the effectiveness of costly remediation schemes before implementing them in the field.

Within the energy industry, [[Petroleum engineering|petroleum engineers]], [[Mining engineering|mining geologists]], [[environmental geochemists]] and [[geothermal energy]] developers use the software to search for resources, optimize recovery, and manage wastes, all while using safe and environmentally friendly practices.

[[Geochemistry]] students can save time performing routine but tedious tasks that are easily accomplished with the software. Instead of balancing chemical reactions and constructing [[Pourbaix diagram|Eh-pH diagrams]] by hand, for example, students can spend time exploring advanced topics like [[Chemical equilibrium|multi-component equilibrium]], [[Chemical kinetics|kinetic]] theory, or [[Reactive transport modeling in porous media|reactive transport]].&lt;ref name="GBRM"/&gt; Students can apply for a free download of The Geochemist's Workbench Student Edition from the developer's website.&lt;ref name="GWB Student" /&gt;

In [[political anthropology]], a '''theatre state''' is a political [[state (polity)|state]] directed towards the performance of [[drama]] and [[ritual]] rather than more conventional ends such as [[welfare state|welfare]]. Power in a theatre state is exercised through [[spectacle]]. The term was coined by [[Clifford Geertz]] in 1980 in reference to political practice in the nineteenth-century Balinese [[Negara, Bali|Negara]],&lt;ref&gt;Geertz, C. (1980) ''Negara: The Theatre State in Nineteenth-Century Bali''. [[Princeton University Press]]. {{ISBN|0691007780}}.&lt;/ref&gt; but its usage has since expanded. Hunik Kwon and Byung-Ho Chung, for example, argue that contemporary [[North Korea]] is a theatre state.&lt;ref&gt;Kwon, H. &amp; Chung, B-H. (2012) ''North Korea: Beyond Charismatic Politics''. Rowman &amp; Littlefield, Chapter 2. {{ISBN|1442215771}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In Geertz's original usage, the concept of the theatre state contests the notion that [[precolonial]] society can be analysed in the conventional discourse of [[Oriental despotism]].&lt;ref&gt;Heder, S. "Political Theatre in the 2003 Cambodian Elections", in Strauss, J. C. &amp; O'Brien, D. C. (eds.) (2007) ''Staging Politics: Power and Performance in Asia and Africa''. [[I. B. Tauris]], p. 151.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Universeum''' is a public science centre and museum in [[Gothenburg]], [[Sweden]] that opened in 2001. It is a part of ''Evenemangsstråket'', the ''thoroughfare of events'' – close to [[Korsvägen]] and Skånegatan – which includes sights of interest like [[Scandinavium]], [[Ullevi]], [[Svenska Mässan]] (Swedish Exhibition Centre), [[Liseberg]] and the [[Museum of World Culture]].

Universeum is divided into six sections, each containing experiment workshops and a collection of [[reptile]]s, [[fish]] and [[insect]]s. Universeum occasionally gives Swedish secondary school students a chance to debate with [[Nobel prize]]-winners and professors.

==Main sections==
[[Image:Goeldis monkey - butterfly lunch - big.jpg|thumb|[[Goeldi's marmoset]] run free in the ''Regnskogen'' area.]]
The sections of Universeum are:
* "Kalejdo" - An exhibit about Crime-investigation, [[laser]], [[space]], and more.
* "Explora" - An experiment department that is mostly about humans and technology. 
* "Vattnets Väg" (Water's Way) - The Swedish fresh and [[brackish]] water fishes, reptiles and [[vole]]s.
* "Akvariehallen" (The Ocean Zone) - Marine animals. This includes a {{convert|1400000|l|USgal}} Ocean Tank with sharks and other tropical fish,&lt;ref&gt;Universeum: ''[http://www.universeum.se/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=71&amp;Itemid=82 The Ocean Tank.]'' Retrieved 30 June 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; a {{convert|16|m|ft}} long aquarium with native marine fish,&lt;ref&gt;Universeum: ''[http://www.universeum.se/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=72&amp;Itemid=83&amp;lang=en The Swedish West Coast Aquarium.]'' Retrieved 30 June 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; and a touch tank with [[Batoidea|rays]].&lt;ref&gt;Universeum: ''[http://www.universeum.se/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=69&amp;Itemid=81 The Ray Tank.]'' Retrieved 30 June 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;
* "Regnskogen" (The Rainforest) - A rainforest hall with tropical animals.&lt;ref&gt;Universeum: ''[http://www.universeum.se/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=77&amp;Itemid=86 The Rainforest.]'' Retrieved 30 June 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;
* "Dödliga Skönheter" (Deadly Beauties) - Deadly and venomous reptiles.

The architect behind Universeum is [[Gert Wingårdh]].

The '''V-2''' ({{lang-de|[[V-weapons|Vergeltungswaffe]] 2}}, "Retribution Weapon 2"), technical name ''[[Aggregat (rocket family)|Aggregat]] 4'' (A4), was the world's first long-range&lt;ref&gt;"Long-range" in the context of the time. See [http://www-pao.ksc.nasa.gov/history/rocket-history.htm NASA history article] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090107190509/http://www-pao.ksc.nasa.gov/history/rocket-history.htm |date=7 January 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[missile guidance|guided]] [[ballistic missile]]. The missile, powered by a [[liquid-propellant rocket]] engine, was developed during the [[Second World War]] in [[Nazi Germany|Germany]] as a "[[V-weapons|vengeance weapon]]", assigned to attack Allied cities as retaliation for the [[Strategic bombing during World War II#The British later in the war|Allied bombings]] against German cities. The V-2 rocket also became the first man-made object to travel into space by crossing the [[Kármán line]] with the vertical launch of [[MW 18014]] on 20 June 1944.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Rocket and the Reich: Peenemünde and the Coming of the Ballistic Missile Era|last=Neufeld|first=Michael J|publisher=The Free Press|year=1995|isbn=|location=New York|pages=158, 160–162, 190}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Research into military use of long range rockets began when the studies of graduate student [[Wernher von Braun]] attracted the attention of the German Army. A series of prototypes culminated in the A-4, which went to war as the V-2. Beginning in September 1944, over 3,000 V-2s were launched by the German [[Wehrmacht]] against Allied targets, first [[London]] and later [[Antwerp]] and [[Liège]]. According to a 2011 BBC documentary,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Syed Ramsey|title=Tools of War: History of Weapons in Modern Times|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aUk5DAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT89|year=2016|publisher=Vij Books India Pvt Ltd|isbn=978-93-86019-83-7|page=89}} &lt;/ref&gt; the attacks from V2s resulted in the deaths of an estimated 9,000 civilians and military personnel, and a further 12,000 forced laborers and concentration camp prisoners died as a result of their forced participation in the production of the weapons.&lt;ref&gt;''Am Anfang war die V2.

As Germany collapsed, teams from the [[Allies of World War II|Allied forces]]—the United States, the United Kingdom, and the [[Soviet Union]]—raced to capture key German manufacturing sites and technology. Wernher von Braun and over 100 key V-2 personnel surrendered to the Americans. [[Operation Paperclip|Eventually]], many of the original V-2 team ended up working at the [[Redstone Arsenal]]. The US also captured enough V-2 hardware to build approximately 80 of the missiles. The Soviets gained possession of the V-2 manufacturing facilities after the war, re-established V-2 production, and moved it to the Soviet Union.

==Developmental history==
In the late 1920s, a young [[Wernher von Braun]] bought a copy of [[Hermann Oberth]]'s book, ''[[Wege zur Raumschiffahrt|Die Rakete zu den Planetenräumen]]'' (''The Rocket into Interplanetary Spaces'').&lt;ref name="WvB"&gt;[[Wernher von Braun#Early life]].&lt;/ref&gt; Starting in 1930, he attended the [[Technical University of Berlin]], where he assisted Oberth in liquid-fueled rocket motor tests.&lt;ref name="WvB"/&gt; Von Braun was working on his doctorate when the [[National Socialist German Workers Party|Nazi Party]] gained power in Germany.&lt;ref name="PrusRocketeer"&gt;[[Wernher von Braun#The Prussian rocketeer and working under the Nazis]].&lt;/ref&gt; An artillery captain, [[Walter Dornberger]], arranged an Ordnance Department research grant for von Braun, who from then on worked next to Dornberger's existing solid-fuel rocket test site at [[Kummersdorf]].&lt;ref name="PrusRocketeer"/&gt; Von Braun's thesis, ''Construction, Theoretical, and Experimental Solution to the Problem of the Liquid Propellant Rocket'' (dated 16 April 1934), was kept classified by the [[German Army (Wehrmacht)|German Army]] and was not published until 1960.&lt;ref&gt;''Konstruktive, theoretische und experimentelle Beiträge zu dem Problem der Flüssigkeitsrakete. Raketentechnik und Raumfahrtforschung, Sonderheft 1'' (1960), Stuttgart, Germany&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of 1934, his group had successfully launched two rockets that reached heights of {{cvt|2.2|and|3.5|km|mi}}.&lt;ref name="PrusRocketeer"/&gt;

At the time, Germany was highly interested in American physicist [[Robert H. Goddard]]'s research. Before 1939, German engineers and scientists occasionally contacted Goddard directly with technical questions.&lt;ref name="PrusRocketeer"/&gt; Von Braun used Goddard's plans from various journals and incorporated them into the building of the ''[[Aggregate series|Aggregat]]'' (A) series of [[rocket]]s,&lt;ref name="PrusRocketeer"/&gt; named for the German word for mechanism or mechanical system.&lt;ref&gt;Christopher, John. ''The Race for Hitler's X-Planes'' (The Mill, Gloucestershire: History Press, 2013), p.110.&lt;/ref&gt;

Following successes at [[Kummersdorf]] with the first two [[Aggregate series]] rockets, Wernher von Braun and [[Walter Riedel]] began thinking of a much larger rocket in the summer of 1936,&lt;ref name=Ordway&gt;{{cite book |last=Ordway |first= Frederick I, III | author1-link = Frederick I.

By late 1941, the [[Peenemünde Army Research Center|Army Research Center]] at Peenemünde possessed the technologies essential to the success of the A-4.

==Technical details==
[[File:Aggregat4-Schnitt-engl.jpg|left|upright=1.35|thumb|Layout of a V-2 rocket]]
The A-4 used a 74% [[ethanol]]/water mixture ([[List of stoffs|''B-Stoff'']]) for fuel and [[liquid oxygen]] (LOX) ([[List of stoffs|''A-Stoff'']]) for [[oxidizer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Dungan|first=T|title=The A4-V2 Rocket Site|url=http://www.v2rocket.com/start/makeup/design.html|accessdate=2 June 2011|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110531211234/http://www.v2rocket.com/start/makeup/design.html|archivedate=31 May 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At launch the A-4 propelled itself for up to 65 seconds on its own power, and a program motor controlled the pitch to the specified angle at engine shutdown, after which the rocket continued on a [[wikt:ballistic|ballistic]] free-fall trajectory. The rocket reached a height of {{cvt|80|km}} after shutting off the engine.&lt;ref&gt;[[History (U.S. TV channel)|The History Channel]] V2 Factory: Nordhausen 070723&lt;/ref&gt;

The fuel and oxidizer pumps were driven by a steam turbine, and the steam was produced by concentrated [[hydrogen peroxide]] with [[sodium permanganate]] [[catalyst]]. Both the alcohol and oxygen tanks were an aluminium-magnesium alloy.&lt;ref name=Kennedy&gt;{{cite book |last=Kennedy|first= Gregory P.|title=Vengeance Weapon 2: The V-2 Guided Missile|year=1983 |publisher= Smithsonian Institution Press|location= Washington DC|pages=27, 74}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The combustion burner reached a temperature of {{convert|2500|to|2700|C|F}}. The alcohol-water fuel was pumped along the double wall of the main combustion burner. This [[regenerative cooling (rocket)|regenerative cooling]] heated the fuel and cooled the [[combustion chamber]]. The fuel was then pumped into the main burner chamber through 1,224 nozzles, which assured the correct mixture of alcohol and oxygen at all times. Small holes also permitted some alcohol to escape directly into the combustion chamber, forming a cooled [[boundary layer]] that further protected the wall of the chamber, especially at the throat where the chamber was narrowest. The boundary layer alcohol ignited on contact with the atmosphere, accounting for the long, diffuse exhaust plume. By contrast, later, post-V-2 engine designs not employing this alcohol boundary layer cooling show a translucent plume with [[shock diamond]]s.

The warhead was another source of troubles. The explosive employed was [[amatol|amatol 60/40]] detonated by an electric [[contact fuze]]. Amatol had the advantage of stability and the warhead was protected by a thick layer of [[fiberglass]], but even so it could still explode in the re-entry phase. The warhead weighed {{convert|975|kg|lb}} and contained {{convert|910|kg|lb}} of explosive. The warhead's percentage by weight that was explosive was 93%, a very high percentage when compared with other types of munition.

The protective layer was used for the fuel tanks as well and the A-4 did not have the tendency to form ice, which was common to other early missiles (like the [[balloon tank]]-design [[SM-65 Atlas]]). The tanks held {{convert|4173|kg|lb}} of ethyl alcohol and {{convert|5553|kg|lb}} of oxygen.&lt;ref&gt;War machine encyclopedia, Limited publishing, London 1983 p 1690-92&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Antwerp V-2.jpg|thumb|Captured V-2 on public display in Antwerp, 1945. Exhaust vanes and external rudders in tail section shown.]]
The V-2 was guided by four external rudders on the tail fins, and four internal [[graphite]] vanes in the jet stream at the exit of the motor. The LEV-3 guidance system consisted of two free [[gyroscope]]s (a horizontal and a vertical) for lateral stabilization, and a [[PIGA accelerometer]] to control engine cutoff at a specified velocity. The V-2 was launched from a pre-surveyed location, so the distance and [[azimuth]] to the target were known. Fin 1 of the missile was aligned to the target azimuth.&lt;ref&gt;Stakem, Patrick H. ''The History of Spacecraft Computers from the V-2 to the Space Station'', 2010, PRB Publishing, ASIN B004L626U6&lt;/ref&gt;

Some later V-2s used "[[Beam riding|guide beams]]", radio signals transmitted from the ground, to keep the missile on course, but the first models used a simple [[analog computer]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cdvandt.org/Hoelzer%20V4.pdf Helmut Hoelzer’s Fully Electronic Analog Computer used in the German V2 (A4) rockets.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160428214820/http://cdvandt.org/Hoelzer%20V4.pdf |date=28 April 2016 }} (PDF, English, German)&lt;/ref&gt; that adjusted the azimuth for the rocket, and the flying distance was controlled by the timing of the engine cut-off, ''"[[Brennschluss]]"'', ground controlled by a [[Doppler effect|Doppler]] system or by different types of on-board integrating [[accelerometer]]s. The rocket stopped accelerating and soon reached the top of the approximately [[parabola|parabolic]] flight curve.

Dr. Friedrich Kirchstein of [[Siemens]] of Berlin developed the V-2 [[radio control]] for motor-cut-off ({{lang-de|Brennschluss}}).&lt;ref name=Irving/&gt;{{Rp|28,124}} For velocity measurement, Professor Wolman of Dresden created an alternative of his Doppler&lt;ref name=Pocock/&gt;{{Rp|18}} tracking system in 1940–41, which used a ground signal transponded by the A-4 to measure the velocity of the missile.&lt;ref name=Neufeld/&gt;{{Rp|103}} By 9 February 1942, Peenemünde engineer De Beek had documented the radio interference area of a V-2 as {{convert|10,000|m|ft|abbr=off}} around the "Firing Point",&lt;ref name=Klee/&gt; and the first successful A-4 flight on 3 October 1943, used radio control for ''Brennschluss''.&lt;ref name=Dornberger/&gt;{{Rp|12}} Although Hitler commented on 22 September 1943 that "It is a great load off our minds that we have dispensed with the radio guiding-beam; now no opening remains for the British to interfere technically with the missile in flight",&lt;ref name=Irving/&gt;{{Rp|138}} about 20% of the operational V-2 launches were beam-guided.&lt;ref name=Dornberger/&gt;{{Rp|12}} The [[Operation Crossbow|Operation Pinguin]] V-2 offensive began on 8 September 1944, when ''Lehr- und Versuchsbatterie No. 444''&lt;ref name=Pocock/&gt;{{Rp|51–2}} ({{lang-en|Training and Testing Battery 444}}) launched a single rocket guided by a radio beam directed at Paris.&lt;ref name=Klee/&gt;{{Rp|47}} Wreckage of combat V-2s occasionally contained the transponder for velocity and fuel cutoff.&lt;ref name=Ordway/&gt;{{Rp|259–60}}

The painting of the operational V-2s was mostly a [[Splittertarnmuster|ragged-edged pattern]] with several variations, but at the end of the war a plain olive green rocket also appeared. During tests, the rocket was painted in a characteristic black-and-white [[chessboard]] pattern, which aided in determining if the rocket was spinning around its longitudinal axis.

[[File:Esquema de la V-2.jpg|thumb|A [[United States Army|U.S. Army]] cut-away of the V-2]]

The original German designation of the rocket was "V2", unhyphenated — exactly as used for [[RLM aircraft designation system#Prototypes and variants|any Third Reich-era "second prototype" example]] of an [[RLM aircraft by manufacturer|RLM-registered]] German aircraft design — but U.S. publications such as [[Life (magazine)|''Life'' magazine]] were using the hyphenated form "V-2" as early as December 1944.&lt;ref name="V2_LIFE"&gt;{{cite journal|date=25 December 1944|title=V-2: Nazi Rocket Details Are Finally Revealed|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uUEEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA46|journal=[[Life (magazine)|LIFE]]|volume=17|issue=26|pages=46–48|author1=Inc|first1=Time}}&lt;/ref&gt; This hyphenated form has now become common usage.

Various design issues were identified and solved during V-2 development and testing:
:* To reduce tank pressure and weight, high flow turbopumps were used to boost pressure.&lt;ref name=Neufeld/&gt;{{Rp|35}}
:* A short and lighter [[combustion chamber]] without burn-through was developed by using centrifugal injection nozzles, a mixing compartment, and a converging nozzle to the throat for homogeneous combustion.&lt;ref name=Dornberger/&gt;{{Rp|51}}
:* Film cooling was used to prevent burn-through at the nozzle throat.&lt;ref name=Dornberger/&gt;{{Rp|52}}
:* Relay contacts were made more durable to withstand vibration and prevent thrust cut-off just after lift-off.&lt;ref name=Dornberger/&gt;{{Rp|52}}
:* Ensuring that the fuel pipes had tension-free curves reduced the likelihood of explosions at {{cvt|4000|-|6000|ft|order=flip}}.&lt;ref name=Dornberger/&gt;{{Rp|215,217}}
:* Fins were shaped with clearance to prevent damage as the exhaust jet expanded with altitude.&lt;ref name=Dornberger/&gt;{{Rp|56,118}}

The [[LXV Army Corps (Wehrmacht)|LXV Armeekorps z.b.V.]] formed during the last days of November 1943 in France commanded by General der Artillerie z.V. [[Erich Heinemann]] was responsible for the operational use of V-2.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.axishistory.com/books/149-germany-heer/heer-korps/2781-lxv-armeekorps-zbv LXV Armeekorps z.b.V.]&lt;/ref&gt;

After Hitler's 29 August 1944 declaration to begin V-2 attacks as soon as possible, the offensive began on 8 September 1944 with a single launch at Paris, which caused modest damage near [[Porte d'Italie]].&lt;ref name=Ordway/&gt;{{Rp|218,220,467}} Two more launches by the 485th followed, including one from [[The Hague]] against London on the same day at 6:43&amp;nbsp;p.m.&lt;ref name=Irving/&gt;{{Rp|285}} – the first landed at [[Staveley Road]], [[Chiswick]], killing 63-year-old Mrs. Ada Harrison, 3-year-old Rosemary Clarke, and [[Sapper]] Bernard Browning on leave from the Royal Engineers,&lt;ref name=Middlebrook/&gt;{{Rp|11}} and one that hit Epping with no casualties. Upon hearing [[Sonic boom|the double-crack]] of the supersonic rocket (London's first ever), [[Duncan Sandys]] and [[Reginald Victor Jones]] looked up from different parts of the city and exclaimed "That was a rocket!", and a short while after the double-crack, the sky was filled with the sound of a heavy body rushing through the air.&lt;ref name=Irving/&gt;{{Rp|286}}

The British government initially attempted to conceal the cause of the explosions by blaming them on defective [[Coal gas|gas]] mains.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aUk5DAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT96|title=Tools of War: History of Weapons in Modern Times|last=Ramsey|first=Syed|date=2016-05-12|publisher=Vij Books India Pvt Ltd|isbn=978-93-86019-83-7|page=96}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{cn|date=October 2017}} The public therefore began referring to the V-2s as "flying gas pipes".&lt;ref&gt;King, Kutta (1998), p.244&lt;/ref&gt; The Germans themselves finally announced the V-2 on 8 November 1944 and only then, on 10 November 1944, did [[Winston Churchill]] inform Parliament, and the world, that England had been under rocket attack "for the last few weeks".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite hansard |title=German Long-Range Rockets |url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1944/nov/10/german-long-range-rockets#S5CV0404P0_19441110_HOC_3 |house=Commons |date=10 November 1944 |column=1653-4 |speaker=[[Winston Churchill]] |position=Prime Minister |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140420025034/http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1944/nov/10/german-long-range-rockets#S5CV0404P0_19441110_HOC_3 |archivedate=20 April 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 1944 control of the V2 mission was taken over by the [[Waffen-SS]].&lt;ref&gt; and [[Division z.V]] [http://www.axishistory.com/books/149-germany-heer/heer-korps/2781-lxv-armeekorps-zbv LXV Armeekorps z.b.V.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.v2rocket.com/start/deployment/westerwald.html A4/V2 Launch Sites in Westerwald, Germany]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.axishistory.com/books/119-germany-waffen-ss/germany-waffen-ss-divisions/1331-division-zv]&lt;/ref&gt;

Positions of the German launch units changed a number of times. For example, ''Artillerie Init 444'' arrived in the southwest Netherlands (in [[Zeeland]]) in September 1944. From a field near the village of [[Serooskerke, Walcheren|Serooskerke]], five V-2s were launched on 15 and 16 September, with one more successful and one failed launch on the 18th. That same date, a transport carrying a missile took a wrong turn and ended up in Serooskerke itself, giving a villager the opportunity to surreptitiously take some photographs of the weapon; these were smuggled to London by the [[Dutch Resistance]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Walcheren onder vuur en water 1939–1945|last2=Eekman|first2=P.G.|last3=Roelse|first3=J.|last4=Tuynman|first4=J.|publisher=Den Boer Middelburg/Uitgevers|year=1984|isbn=90 70027 82 8|location=[[Middelburg]]|page=98|language=nl|last1=van Dijk|first1=A.H.}}&lt;/ref&gt; After that the unit moved to the woods near [[Rijs]], [[Gaasterland]] in the northwest Netherlands, to ensure that the technology did not fall into Allied hands. From Gaasterland V-2s were launched against [[Ipswich]] and [[Norwich]] from 25 September (London being out of range). Because of their inaccuracy, these V-2s did not hit their target cities. Shortly after that only London and Antwerp remained as designated targets as ordered by [[Adolf Hitler]] himself, Antwerp being targeted in the period of 12 to 20 October, after which time the unit moved to The Hague.

British intelligence sent false reports via their [[Double-Cross System]] implying that the rockets were over-shooting their London target by {{convert|10|to|20|mi|0|abbr=out}}. This tactic worked; more than half of the V-2s aimed at London landed outside the London Civil Defense Region.&lt;ref name=jones&gt;Jones RV; Most Secret War 1978&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|p. 459}} Most landed on less-heavily populated areas in [[Kent]] due to erroneous recalibration.

[[Antwerp]], Belgium was also the target for a large number of V-weapon attacks from October 1944 through March 1945, leaving 1,736 dead and 4,500 injured in greater Antwerp. Thousands of buildings were damaged or destroyed as the city was struck by 590 direct hits. The largest loss of life in a single attack came on 16 December 1944, when the roof of the crowded cinema [[Cine Rex|REX]] was struck, leaving 567 dead and 291 injured.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=V2Rocket.com "Antwerp, The City of Sudden Death"|url=http://www.v2rocket.com/start/chapters/antwerp.html|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150703163237/http://www.v2rocket.com/start/chapters/antwerp.html|archivedate=3 July 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Possible use during Operation ''Bodenplatte''===
At least one V-2 missile on a mobile ''[[Meillerwagen]]'' launch trailer was observed being elevated to launch position by a [[USAAF]] [[4th Fighter Group]] pilot defending against the massive New Year's Day 1945 [[Operation Bodenplatte]] strike by the Luftwaffe over the northern German attack route near the town of [[Lochem]] on 1 January 1945. Possibly, from the potential sighting of the American fighter by the missile's launch crew, the rocket was quickly lowered from a near launch-ready 85° elevation to 30°.&lt;ref&gt;Ordway &amp; Sharpe 1979, p. 256.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tactical use===
After the US Army captured the [[Ludendorff Bridge]] during the [[Battle of Remagen]], the Germans were desperate to destroy it. On 17 March 1945, they fired eleven V2 missiles at the bridge, their first use against a tactical target. They could not employ the more accurate ''Leitstrahl'' device because it was oriented towards Antwerp and could not be easily adjusted for another target. Fired from near [[Hellendoorn]], the Netherlands, one of the missiles landed as far away as Cologne, {{convert|40|mi}} to the north, while one missed the bridge by only {{convert|500|to|800|yard}}. They also struck the town of Remagen, destroying a number of buildings and killing at least six American soldiers.&lt;ref name=v2rocket&gt;{{cite web|title=V-2s on Remagen; Attacks On The Ludendorff Bridge|url=http://www.v2rocket.com/start/deployment/v2s-on-remagen.html|website=V2Rocket.com|accessdate=14 November 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141114012341/http://www.v2rocket.com/start/deployment/v2s-on-remagen.html|archivedate=14 November 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The final two rockets exploded on 27 March 1945. One of these was the last V-2 to kill a British civilian: Mrs. Ivy Millichamp, aged 34, killed in her home in Kynaston Road, [[Orpington]] in Kent.&lt;ref&gt;Foster, Vicki.

A scientific reconstruction carried out in 2010 demonstrated that the V-2 creates a crater {{convert|20|m|ft|abbr=off}} wide and {{convert|8|m|ft|abbr=off}} deep, ejecting approximately 3,000 tons of material into the air.&lt;ref name="Blitz Street; Channel 4, 10.5.2010"/&gt;

=== Post-war history===
After the Nazi defeat, German engineers were moved to the United States, the United Kingdom and the USSR, where they further developed the V-2 rocket for military and civilian purposes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hqADewyvEVQC&amp;pg=PA35|title=Space Policy in Developing Countries: The Search for Security and Development on the Final Frontier|publisher=Routledge|year=2012|pages=34–35|author=Robert C.

==Countermeasures==
{{Main article|Operation Crossbow| Project Big Ben}}

[[File:V-2 förbränningskammare.JPG|thumb|[[Rocket engine]] used by V-2, ''[[Deutsches Historisches Museum]]'', Berlin (2014)]]

===Big Ben and Crossbow===
Unlike the [[V-1 flying bomb|V-1]], the V-2's speed and trajectory made it practically invulnerable to anti-aircraft guns and fighters, as it dropped from an altitude of {{cvt|100|-|110|km}} at up to three times the speed of sound at sea level (approximately 3550&amp;nbsp;km/h). Nevertheless, the threat of what was then code-named "Big Ben" was great enough that efforts were made to seek countermeasures. The situation was similar to the pre-war concerns about manned bombers and led to a similar solution, the formation of the Crossbow Committee to collect, examine and develop countermeasures.

Early on, it was believed that the V-2 employed some form of radio guidance, a belief that persisted in spite of several rockets being examined without discovering anything like a radio receiver. This led to efforts to jam this non-existent guidance system as early as September 1944, using both ground and air-based jammers flying over the UK. In October, a group had been sent to jam the missiles during launch. By December it was clear these systems were having no obvious effect, and jamming efforts ended.&lt;ref name="stock25"&gt;Jeremy Stocker, [https://books.google.com/books?id=rr-RAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA20 "Britain and Ballistic Missile Defence, 1942–2002"], pp. 20–28.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Anti-aircraft gun system===
General [[Frederick Alfred Pile]], commander of [[Anti-Aircraft Command]], studied the problem and proposed that enough [[anti-aircraft gun]]s were available to produce a barrage of fire in the rocket's path, but only if provided with a reasonable prediction of the trajectory. The first estimates suggested that 320,000 shells would have to be fired for each rocket. About 2% of these were expected to fall back to the ground, almost 90 tons of rounds, which would cause far more damage than the missile. At a 25 August 1944 meeting of the Crossbow Committee, the concept was rejected.&lt;ref name=stock25/&gt;

Pile continued studying the problem, and returned with a proposal to fire only 150 shells at a single rocket, with those shells using a new fuse that would greatly reduce the number that fell back to Earth unexploded. Some low-level analysis suggested that this would be successful against 1 in 50 rockets, provided that accurate trajectories were forwarded to the gunners in time. Work on this basic concept continued and developed into a plan to deploy a large number of guns in [[Hyde Park, London|Hyde Park]] that were provided with pre-configured firing data for {{convert|2.5|mi|km|1|adj=mid|abbr=off}} grids of the London area. After the trajectory was determined, the guns would aim and fire between 60 and 500 rounds.&lt;ref name=stock25/&gt;

At a Crossbow meeting on 15 January 1945 Pile's updated plan was presented with some strong advocacy from [[Roderic Hill]] and [[Charles Drummond Ellis]]. However, the Committee suggested that a test not be carried out as no technique for tracking the missiles with sufficient accuracy had yet been developed. By March this had changed significantly, with 81% of incoming missiles correctly allotted to the grid square each fell into, or the one beside it. At a 26 March meeting the plan moved ahead, and Pile was directed to a subcommittee with [[RV Jones]] and Ellis to further develop the statistics. Three days later the team returned a report stating that if the guns fired 2,000 rounds at a missile there was a 1 in 60 chance of shooting it down. Plans for an operational test began, but as Pile later put it, "[[Bernard Montgomery|Monty]] beat us to it", as the attacks ended with the Allied liberation of their launching areas.&lt;ref name=stock25/&gt;

With the Germans no longer in control of any part of the continent that could be used as a launching site capable of striking London, they turned their attention on Antwerp. Plans were made to move the Pile system to protect that city, but the war ended before anything could be done.&lt;ref name=stock25/&gt;

===Direct attack===
Another defence against the V-2 campaign was to destroy the launch infrastructure—expensive in terms of bomber resources and casualties—or to cause the Germans to aim at the wrong place through [[disinformation]]. The British were able to convince the Germans to direct [[V-1 flying bomb|V-1]]s and V-2s aimed at London to less populated areas east of the city. This was done by sending deceptive reports on the damage caused and sites hit via the German espionage network in Britain, which was controlled by the British (the [[Double-Cross System]]).{{Citation needed|date = July 2016}}

According to the BBC television presenter [[Raymond Baxter]], who served with the RAF during the war, in February 1945 his squadron was carrying out a mission against a V2 launch site, when one missile was launched in front of them. One member of Baxter's squadron opened fire on it, without effect.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.v2rocket.com/start/deployment/denhaag.html&lt;/ref&gt;

On 3 March 1945 the Allies attempted to destroy V-2s and launching equipment in the "Haagse Bos" in The Hague by a [[Bombing of the Bezuidenhout|large-scale bombardment]], but due to navigational errors the [[Bezuidenhout]] quarter was destroyed, killing 511 Dutch civilians. Churchill sent a scathing minute to General Ismay requesting a thorough explanation for "this extraordinarily bad aiming".&lt;ref&gt;Churchill to Ismay: 18 March 1945&lt;/ref&gt;

==Assessment==
The German V-weapons (V-1 and V-2) cost the equivalent of around USD $40 billion (2015 dollars), which was 50 percent more than the [[Manhattan Project]] that produced the atomic bomb.&lt;ref name=Ordway/&gt;{{Rp|178}}
6,048 V-2s were built, at a cost of approximately 100,000 [[German reichsmark|Reichsmark]] (GB£2,370,000 (2011)) each; 3,225 were launched.
SS General [[Hans Kammler]], who as an [[engineer]] had constructed several [[concentration camp]]s including [[Auschwitz]], had a reputation for brutality and had originated the idea of using concentration camp prisoners as [[slavery|slave]] laborers in the rocket program. More people died manufacturing the V-2 than were killed by its deployment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.v2rocket.com/start/chapters/mittel.html|title=V2ROCKET.COM - Mittelwerk / DORA|work=v2rocket.com|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130719045156/http://www.v2rocket.com/start/chapters/mittel.html|archivedate=19 July 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;div class="infobox" style="width:20em;"&gt;
"... those of us who were seriously engaged in the war were very grateful to Wernher von Braun. We knew that each V-2 cost as much to produce as a high-performance fighter airplane. We knew that German forces on the fighting fronts were in desperate need of airplanes, and that the V-2 rockets were doing us no military damage. From our point of view, the V-2 program was almost as good as if Hitler had adopted a policy of unilateral disarmament." ([[Freeman Dyson]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Dyson |first=Freeman |year=1979 |title=Disturbing the Universe |url=https://books.google.com/?id=RHzoMeU2bxsC&amp;pg=PA108#PPA108,M1 |publisher=Harper &amp; Row |page=108 |isbn=978-0-465-01677-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The V-2 consumed a third of [[Nazi Germany|Germany]]'s fuel alcohol production and major portions of other critical technologies:&lt;ref name=Oberg&gt;{{cite web |author=[[James Oberg|Jim Oberg]] and Dr. Brian R Sullivan |date=March 1999 |title='Space Power Theory |url=http://space.au.af.mil/books/oberg/ |location=[[U.S. Air Force Space Command]] |publisher=Government Printing Office |page=143 |accessdate=28 November 2008 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090203015711/http://space.au.af.mil/books/oberg/ |archivedate=3 February 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; to distil the fuel alcohol for one V-2 launch required 30 tonnes of potatoes at a time when food was becoming scarce.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.information-britain.co.uk/famdates.php?id=77|title=The 8th of September 1944 AD, First German V2 rocket lands on London|work=information-britain.co.uk|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091207050041/http://www.information-britain.co.uk/famdates.php?id=77|archivedate=7 December 2009|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to a lack of explosives, some warheads were simply filled in with concrete, using the [[kinetic energy]] alone for destruction, and sometimes the warhead contained photographic propaganda of German citizens who had died in Allied bombings.&lt;ref name=Irons2&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Irons |first=Roy |title=Hitler's terror weapons: The price of vengeance}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The V-2 lacked a [[proximity fuze]], so it could not be set for [[air burst]]; it buried itself in the target area before or just as the warhead detonated. This reduced its effectiveness. Furthermore, its early guidance systems were too primitive to hit specific targets and its costs were approximately equivalent to 40% of the cost of a two-engine Ju-88 bomber,&lt;ref&gt;https://ageconsearch.umn.edu/bitstream/28473/1/dp050905.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; which was more accurate (though only in a [[Strategic Bombing During World War II#Effectiveness|relative sense]]), which could carry more warheads and was reusable. In comparison, in one 24-hour period during [[Operation Hurricane (1944)|Operation Hurricane]], the RAF dropped over 10,000 [[long ton]]s of bombs on [[Braunschweig|Brunswick]] and [[Duisburg]], roughly equivalent to the amount of explosives that could be delivered by 10,000 V-2 rockets.

While the V-programs did in fact divert resources needed for other, more effective programs, this aspect should not be overstated, as the limiting factor for German aviation after 1941 was always the availability of [[Synthetic fuel#History|high test aviation gas]], not planes or pilots, so criticisms that compare their cost to hypothetical increases in fighter or bomber production are misguided. On the other hand, the psychological effect of the V-2 was considerable, as the V-2, travelling faster than the [[speed of sound]], gave no warning before impact (unlike bombing planes or the [[V-1 Flying Bomb]], which made a characteristic buzzing sound). There was no effective defence and no risk of pilot and crew casualties.

With the war all but lost, regardless of the factory output of conventional weapons, the Nazis resorted to V-weapons as a tenuous last hope to influence the war militarily (hence Antwerp as V-2 target), as an extension of their desire to "punish" their foes and most importantly to give hope to their supporters with their [[Wunderwaffe|miracle weapon]].&lt;ref name=Irons/&gt; The V-2 had no effect on the outcome of the war, but it led to the [[Intercontinental ballistic missile|ICBM]]s of the [[Cold War]] that were used for space exploration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eucom.mil/article/23076/this-week-in-eucom-history-february-6-12-1959 |title=This Week in EUCOM History: February 6–12, 1959 |date=6 February 2012 |publisher=[[EUCOM]] |accessdate=2012-02-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120921003453/http://www.eucom.mil/article/23076/this-week-in-eucom-history-february-6-12-1959 |archivedate=21 September 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A submarine-towed launch platform was tested successfully, making it the prototype for [[submarine-launched ballistic missile]]s. The project codename was ''Prüfstand XII'' ("Test stand XII"), sometimes called the [[rocket U-boat]]. If deployed, it would have allowed a [[U-boat]] to launch V-2 missiles against United States cities, though only with considerable effort (and limited effect).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.uboataces.com/articles-rocket-uboat.shtml |title=Hitler's Rocket U-boat Program - history of WW2 rocket submarine |publisher=Uboataces.com |accessdate=27 April 2010 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100403090456/http://www.uboataces.com/articles-rocket-uboat.shtml |archivedate=3 April 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Hitler, in July 1944 and Speer, in January 1945, made speeches alluding to the scheme,&lt;ref&gt;Article in San Diego Times c.25 July 1944&lt;/ref&gt; though Germany did not possess the capability to fulfill these threats. These schemes were met by the Americans with [[Operation Teardrop]].{{Citation needed|date = July 2016}}

While interned after the war by the British at [[CSDIC]] camp 11, Dornberger was recorded saying that he had begged the Führer to stop the V-weapon propaganda, because nothing more could be expected from one ton of explosive. To this Hitler had replied that ''Dornberger'' might not expect more, but ''he'' (Hitler) certainly did.{{Citation needed|date = July 2016}}

According to decrypted messages from the Japanese embassy in Germany, twelve dismantled V-2 rockets were shipped to Japan.&lt;ref&gt;Besant, John ''Stalin's Silver'' concerning the sinking of [[SS John Barry|SS ''John Barry'']] near [[Aden]] in 1944&lt;/ref&gt; These left [[Bordeaux]] in August 1944 on the transport U-boats {{GS|U-219||2}} and {{GS|U-195||2}}, which reached [[Djakarta]] in December 1944. A civilian V-2 expert was a passenger on ''{{GS|U-234||2}}'', bound for Japan in May 1945 when the war ended in Europe. The fate of these V-2 rockets is unknown.{{Citation needed|date = July 2016}}

==Post-war use==
At the end of the war, a race began between the United States and the [[Soviet Union|USSR]] to retrieve as many V-2 rockets and staff as possible.&lt;ref&gt;"We Want with the West", ''Time Magazine,'' 9 December 1946.&lt;/ref&gt; Three hundred rail-car loads of V-2s and parts were captured and shipped to the United States and 126 of the principal designers, including Wernher von Braun and Walter Dornberger, were in American hands. Von Braun, his brother [[Magnus von Braun]], and seven others decided to surrender to the United States military ([[Operation Paperclip]]) to ensure they were not captured by the advancing Soviets or shot dead by the Nazis to prevent their capture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Wernher von Braun |url=http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/Features/vonBraun/vonbraun_3.php |accessdate=4 July 2009 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090823183825/http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/Features/vonBraun/vonbraun_3.php |archivedate=23 August 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 1945, British ''[[Operation Backfire (WWII)|Operation Backfire]]'' assembled a small number of V-2 missiles and launched three of them from a site in northern Germany. The engineers involved had already agreed to move to the US when the test firings were complete. The Backfire report remains the most extensive technical documentation of the rocket, including all support procedures, tailored vehicles and fuel composition.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}}

In 1946, the [[British Interplanetary Society]] proposed an enlarged man-carrying version of the V-2, called Megaroc. It could have enabled [[sub-orbital spaceflight]] similar to, but at least a decade earlier than, the [[Mercury-Redstone]] flights of 1961.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=How a Nazi rocket could have put a Briton in space|url=http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20150824-how-a-nazi-rocket-could-have-put-a-briton-in-space|work=BBC|accessdate=16 November 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161114032515/http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20150824-how-a-nazi-rocket-could-have-put-a-briton-in-space|archivedate=14 November 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Megaroc|url=http://www.bis-space.com/what-we-do/projects/megaroc|work=BIS|accessdate=16 November 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161030133900/http://www.bis-space.com/what-we-do/projects/megaroc|archivedate=30 October 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Operation Paperclip]] recruited German engineers and [[Operation Paperclip#Related operations|Special Mission V-2]] transported the captured V-2 parts to the United States. At the close of the Second World War, over 300 rail cars filled with V-2 engines, [[fuselage]]s, [[propellant]] tanks, gyroscopes, and associated equipment were brought to the railyards in [[Las Cruces, New Mexico]], so they could be placed on trucks and driven to the [[White Sands Proving Grounds]], also in New Mexico.

In addition to V-2 hardware, the U.S. Government delivered German mechanization equations for the V-2 guidance, navigation, and control systems, as well as for advanced development concept vehicles, to U.S. defence contractors for analysis. In the 1950s some of these documents were useful to U.S. contractors in developing direction cosine matrix transformations and other inertial navigation architecture concepts that were applied to early U.S. programs such as the Atlas and Minuteman guidance systems as well as the Navy's Subs Inertial Navigation System.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=V2 Information|url=http://v2.x-factorial.com/|work=X-Factorial.com|accessdate=14 December 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131214234047/http://v2.x-factorial.com/|archivedate=14 December 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A committee was formed with military and civilian scientists to review payload proposals for the reassembled V-2 rockets.&lt;ref&gt;By January 1946, the U.S. Army Ordnance Corps invited civilian scientists and engineers to participate in developing a space research program using the V-2. The committee was initially called the [[Upper Atmosphere Research Panel|"V2 Rocket Panel"]], then the "V2 Upper Atmosphere Research Panel", and finally the "Upper Atmosphere Rocket Research Panel". See: Johan A.M. Bleeker, Johannes Geiss, and Martin C.E. Huber, ed.s, ''The Century of Space Science'', vol. 1 (Dordrecht, Netherlands: Kluwer Academic Publishers, 2001) [https://books.google.com/books?id=NMk3adgqfawC&amp;pg=PA41 p. 41.] See also: [http://www.spaceline.org/history/6.html SpaceLine.org] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121113104258/http://spaceline.org/history/6.html |date=13 November 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This led to an eclectic array of experiments that flew on V-2s and paved the way for American manned [[space exploration]]. Devices were sent aloft to sample the air at all levels to determine [[atmospheric pressure]]s and to see what [[gases]] were present. Other instruments measured the level of [[cosmic radiation]].

Only 68 percent of the V-2 trials were considered successful.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=V-2 Rocket Components |url=http://www.wsmr.army.mil/PAO/WSHist/V2/Pages/V2RocketComponents.aspx |publisher=U.S. Army, White Sands Missile Range |year=2010 |accessdate=14 December 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130902060914/http://www.wsmr.army.mil/PAO/WSHist/V2/Pages/V2RocketComponents.aspx |archivedate=2 September 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; A supposed V-2 launched on 29 May 1947 landed near Juarez, Mexico and was actually a [[Hermes project|Hermes B-1 vehicle]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Beggs |first=William |url=http://www.postwarv2.com/hermes |title=Hermes Program |accessdate=1 December 2008 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110930100414/http://www.postwarv2.com/hermes/ |archivedate=30 September 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[United States Navy|U.S. Navy]] attempted to launch a German V-2 rocket at sea&amp;mdash;one test launch from the aircraft carrier [[USS Midway (CV-41)|USS Midway]] was performed on 6 September 1947 as part of the Navy's [[Operation Sandy]]. The test launch was a partial success; the V-2 went off the pad but splashed down in the ocean only some {{cvt|10|km|0}} from the carrier. The launch setup on the Midway's deck is notable in that it used foldaway arms to prevent the missile from falling over. The arms pulled away just after the engine ignited, releasing the missile. The setup may look similar to the [[R-7 Semyorka|R-7]] launch procedure but in the case of the R-7 the trusses hold the full weight of the rocket, rather than just reacting to side forces.

The [[PGM-11 Redstone]] rocket is a direct descendant of the V-2.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.centennialofflight.net/essay/Dictionary/REDSTONE/DI149.htm |title=Redstone rocket |publisher=centennialofflight.net |accessdate=27 April 2010 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140220003451/http://www.centennialofflight.net/essay/Dictionary/REDSTONE/DI149.htm |archivedate=20 February 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===USSR===
The [[Soviet Union|USSR]] also captured a number of V-2s and staff, letting them stay in Germany for a time. The first work contracts were signed in the middle of 1945. In 1946 (as part of [[Operation Osoaviakhim]]) they were obliged to move to [[Kapustin Yar]] in the USSR, where [[Helmut Gröttrup]] headed up a group of just under 250 engineers. The first Soviet missile was the [[R-1 rocket|R-1]], a duplicate of the V-2. Most of the German team was sent home after that project but some remained to do research until as late as 1951. Unknown to the Germans, work immediately began on larger missiles, the [[R-2 rocket|R-2]] and [[R-5 missile|R-5]], based on extension of the V-2 technology.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}}

In the autumn of 1945, the group led by M. Tikhonravov K. and N. G. Chernyshov at NII-4 rocket artillery institute of the USSR Academy of Sciences developed on their own initiative the first stratospheric rocket project. [[Project BP-190|BP-190]] called for vertical flight of two pilots to an altitude of 200&amp;nbsp;km using captured German V-2 rockets.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Astronautics: Summary and Prospects|date=December 2012|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=9783709106488|volume=|pages=1–2|asin=|author=Anatoli I.

'''Walter Frederick Gale''' (27 November 1865 &amp;ndash; 1 June 1945) was an Australian [[banker]]. Gale was born in [[Paddington, New South Wales|Paddington, Sydney, New South Wales]]. He had a strong interest in [[astronomy]] and built his first [[telescope]] in 1884.&lt;ref&gt;[http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/gale-walter-frederick-6269 Biography - Walter Frederick Gale - Australian Dictionary of Biography]&lt;/ref&gt;

He discovered a number of [[comet]]s, including the lost periodic comet [[34D/Gale]].  He also discovered five southern [[double star]]s with the prefix GLE, and several dark sky objects, including the planetary nebula, [[IC 5148]] in [[Grus (constellation)|Grus]]. In 1892, he described [[oasis|oases]] and [[Martian canal|canals on Mars]]. He was awarded the [[Jackson-Gwilt Medal]] of the [[Royal Astronomical Society]] in 1935 for "discoveries of comets and his work for astronomy in [[New South Wales]]."

A [[Impact crater|crater]] on Mars, [[Gale (crater)|Gale Crater]], was named in his honour. It was selected as the 2012 landing site for the [[Mars Science Laboratory|Curiosity Rover]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=The Associated Press|title=NASA Launches Sophisticated Rover on Journey to Mars|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/27/science/space/nasas-curiosity-rover-sets-off-for-mars-mission.html|date=26 November 2011|work=The New York Times|accessdate=26 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
