      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1710">'''Aliens Appeals Board''' ({{lang-sv|Utlänningsnämnden}}, UN) was a [[Government agencies in Sweden|Swedish government agency]] that answered to the [[Ministry for Foreign Affairs (Sweden)|Ministry for Foreign Affairs]]. The agency was located in [[Stockholm]].

The Board's powers were similar to those of a [[court|court of law]]. It tried cases under the old Swedish Aliens Act of 1989 and the Swedish Citizenship Act. It also bore a responsibility for the development of [[case law]] in these areas. Its decisions could not be appealed, although in special cases the Board would submit an application to the [[Government of Sweden|Swedish Government]] for a decision.

The Aliens Appeals Board was discontinued and replaced by [[Migration Courts]] on 31 March 2006 when the new Aliens Act entered into force. The new rules of jurisdiction and procedure mean that individuals appealing against the decisions of the Swedish Migration Board (''[[Migrationsverket]]'') will be able to obtain an oral hearing in a Migration Court, in accordance with the provisions governing administrative courts. The opposite party in court proceedings will be the Swedish Migration Board.

[[File:Vestiges du château narbonnais sous le palais de justice - panoramio.jpg|thumb|Remains of the Château Narbonnais under the Toulouse courthouse]]
The '''Château Narbonnais''' was a castle of the [[Counts of Toulouse]] on the west side of the city [[Toulouse]]. The [[castle]] featured prominently in the [[Cathar]] wars.

==History==
In May 1215 the City of Toulouse to surrendered to [[Simon de Montfort, 5th Earl of Leicester|Simon de Montfort]] but in September or October 1216 a [[popular uprising]] in the City against the occupying forces, forced Simon to leave. On 12 September 1217 [[Raymond VI of Toulouse]] re-entered the City, trapping Simon de Montfort's [[Alix de Montmorency|wife]] [[Baldwin IV, Count of Hainaut#family|family]] in the [[Château]]. 

13 September 1217 to 22 July 1218, Simon de Montfort besieges the castle again, without success and on 25 June 1218, he was hit on the head by a stone from a trebuchet, and died.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.catharcastles.info/toulouse.php  Cathar Castles (Château Narbonnaise)].&lt;/ref&gt;

From 16 June to 1 August 1219 [[Louis IX]] laid siege to the castle, again without success.
The castle was dismantled in 1549.

==Description==
The castle was dismantled, but depiction of it remains on the [https://library.nd.edu/medieval/seals/muni/d5683_big.jpg Municipal Seal] of Toulouse&lt;ref&gt;The seal also is the oldest depiction of a [[Cross of Toulouse]].&lt;/ref&gt;  which shows a crenellated castle with three towers&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.midi-france.info/191600_seals.htm   Languedoc Seals ].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Karen Ralls, Medieval Mysteries: A Guide to History, Lore, Places and Symbolism (Nicolas-Hays, Inc., 15 Jan. 2014)  [https://books.google.com.au/books?id=OKOB_pL5wKAC&amp;pg=PA91&amp;lpg=PA91&amp;dq=Municipal+Seal+of+Toulouse&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=vzFD2baRny&amp;sig=hQiwlXWMepNKKweWRsnYNVdLD3Y&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjU-f_-hZrQAhXBKZQKHfuMBOgQ6AEIVzAO#v=onepage&amp;q=Municipal%20Seal%20of%20Toulouse&amp;f=false p91].&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''Daily Graphic''''' is a [[Ghanaian]] state-owned daily [[newspaper]] published in [[Accra]], [[Ghana]].

The paper was established along with the ''Sunday Mirror'' in 1950, by [[Cecil Harmsworth King|Cecil King]] of the [[London Daily Mirror]] Group.&lt;ref name=eribo&gt;Eribo, F., &amp; Jong-Ebot, W. (1997). ''Press Freedom and Communication in Africa.'' Africa World Press. {{ISBN|978-0-86543-551-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt; With a circulation of 100,000 copies, the ''Graphic'' is the most widely read daily newspaper in the country.&lt;ref&gt;Kuehnhenrich, D. (2012). ''Entwicklung oder Profit? Die staatliche und private Presse in Ghana''. ibidem. {{ISBN|978-3-8382-0304-1}} ([https://books.google.com/books?id=_jp1M9yx8u4C&amp;printsec=frontcover online])&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pettersson, A. (2006). ''Literary History: Towards a Global Perspective''. Walter de Gruyter. {{ISBN|978-3-11-018932-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The paper has seen a large number of editors replaced over the course of its history, particularly post-independence, after a string of successive [[Coup d'état|military coups]] that resulted in the sacking editors who opposed the government policies.&lt;ref name=Anokwa&gt;Anokwa, K. (1997). In ''Press Freedom and Communication in Africa.'' Erbio, F., &amp; Jong-Ebot, W. (eds), Africa World Press. {{ISBN|978-0-86543-551-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1979 the newspaper was renamed the ''People's Daily Graphic'' under [[Jerry Rawlings]] for a few years to "remind the people that it belongs to them".&lt;ref name=eribo/&gt; One journalist in particular, Fredrick Botchway, so gifted in his work had excelled at the paper and was swiftly promoted to Chief Editor in the mid 1950s.

Being a state-owned paper, it regularly covers the government in a favourable light, detailing and encouraging national unity and government policy.&lt;ref&gt;Hasty, J. (2005). ''The Press and Political Culture in Ghana.'' Indiana University Press. {{ISBN|978-0-253-34524-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Gold Coast (British colony)|colonial Ghana]] under [[United Kingdom|British]] rule, the paper, which was staffed by local Ghanaians, received large government funding from British banks, which led to its high circulation and raising awareness of events to ordinary Ghanaians, more so than Ghanaian-owned papers.&lt;ref name=eribo/&gt;

The paper, owned by the [http://corporate.graphic.com.gh Graphic Communication Group Limited], also prints two weekly entertainment newspapers, namely ''The Mirror'' and ''Graphic Showbiz''.

'''''Delfi AS v. Estonia''''' (2015) [http://hudoc.echr.coe.int/sites/eng/pages/search.aspx?i=001-155105 ECtHR 64669/09] is a [[European Court of Human Rights]] (ECtHR) case where the grand chamber, by 15-2 majority, ruled that holding [[Estonia]]n news site [[Delfi (web portal)|Delfi]] liable for anonymous defamatory comments posted online from its readers, even when they are removed upon request, was not a violation of the [[Article 10 of the European Convention on Human Rights]]'s guarantees of the freedom of speech.&lt;ref name=Slate1&gt;{{cite web|last1=Newman|first1=Liz Hay|title=EU Court Unexpectedly Rules Estonian Website Is Responsible for User Comments|url=http://www.slate.com/blogs/future_tense/2015/06/17/european_court_of_human_rights_rules_estonian_site_delfi_is_liable_for_comments.html|website=slate.com|publisher=[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ruling was unexpected, because of potential conflicts with the "actual knowledge" standard of Article 14 of the EU's [[Electronic Commerce Directive|E-Commerce Directive]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://blogs.lse.ac.uk/mediapolicyproject/2015/07/01/not-so-different-after-all-reconciling-delfi-vs-estonia-with-eu-rules-on-intermediary-liability/|title=Not so different after all?

The ruling does not yet have direct legal effect, but it may be influential in the development of national and [[European Union law]].&lt;ref name=arstechnica1&gt;{{cite web|last1=Moody|first1=Glyn|title=Shock European court decision: Websites are liable for users' comments|url=http://arstechnica.co.uk/tech-policy/2015/06/shock-european-court-decision-websites-are-liable-for-users-comments/|website=arstechnica.co.uk|publisher=[[Ars Technica]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Elections in Equatorial Guinea''' gives information on [[election]] and election results in [[politics of Equatorial Guinea|Equatorial Guinea]].

Equatorial Guinea elects on national level a [[head of state]] - the [[president]] -  and a [[legislature]]. The president is elected for a seven-year term by the people. President [[Teodoro Obiang Nguema Mbasogo]] was re-elected unopposed on 15 December 2002. The '''[[House of People's Representatives of Equatorial Guinea|Chamber of People's Representatives]]''' (''Cámara de Representantes del Pueblo'') has 100 members, elected for a five-year term by [[proportional representation]] in multi-member [[constituency|constituencies]].

Equatorial Guinea is a [[one party dominant state]]. This means that only one political party, the [[Democratic Party of Equatorial Guinea]] (PDGE) is ''de facto'' allowed to hold effective power.  Although minor [[political parties|parties]] are allowed, they are ''de facto'' required to accept the leadership of the dominant party.{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}}

==2008 election==
In the [[Equatorial Guinean legislative election, 2008|May 2008 parliamentary election]], the PDGE won 99 seats and the opposition [[Convergence for Social Democracy]] won one seat.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jeuneafrique.com/fluxafp/fil_info.asp?reg_id=0&amp;art_cle=45593 "Guinée équatoriale: le parti présidentiel grand vainqueur des législatives"], AFP (Jeuneafrique.com), May 9, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

The next [[Equatorial Guinean presidential election, 2010|presidential election]] was scheduled for 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1111/j.1467-825X.2008.01618.x|title=EQUATORIAL GUINEA: Poll Timetable |journal=Africa Research Bulletin: Political, Social and Cultural Series| publisher=Blackwell |volume=45|pages= 17458A | issue=3|year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3219">The '''Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs''' (ECON) is a [[committee]] of the [[European Parliament]].

Since [[Economic and Monetary Union of the European Union|Economic and Monetary Union]] (EMU), the most important function of this committee has been in relation to the [[European Central Bank]] (ECB). Although guaranteed independence under the Treaty, the ECB is accountable for its actions to ECON. Every three months, the [[President of the European Central Bank|President]] of the ECB, or occasionally his deputy, appears before the Committee to report on monetary policy; both actions taken, and future prospects. He then answers question from [[Member of the European Parliament|MEP]]s. These proceedings are televised;  a verbatim report appears immediately on both the Parliament and ECN websites.

The '''Father-in-law of Europe''' is a [[sobriquet]] which has been used to refer to two [[Europe]]an [[monarch]]s of the late 19th and early 20th century: [[Christian IX of Denmark]] and [[Nicholas I of Montenegro]], both on account of their children's marriages to foreign princes and princesses. The fact that each was a monarch of moderate or modest power (and thus a marriage would not threaten the delicate [[Balance of power (international relations)|balance of power]]) allowed them to marry some of their many children to heirs of greater fortunes across the continent.

==Christian IX of Denmark==
The children of [[King Christian IX of Denmark|King Christian IX]] (1818–1906) and [[Louise of Hesse-Kassel|Queen Louise]] (1817–1898) of Denmark included:
* [[Frederick VIII of Denmark|King Frederick VIII of Denmark]] (1843–1912)
* [[Queen Alexandra of the United Kingdom]] (1844–1925) queen consort of [[Edward VII|King Edward VII]]
* [[King George I of Greece]] (1845–1913)
* [[Maria Feodorovna (Dagmar of Denmark)|Empress Maria Feodorovna of Russia]] (1847–1928) empress consort of [[Alexander III of Russia|Tsar Alexander III]]
* [[Thyra of Denmark|Crown Princess Thyra of Hanover]] (1853–1933), who married [[Ernest Augustus, Crown Prince of Hanover|Crown Prince Ernest Augustus]]

Christian IX used to gather his children, children-in-law and grandchildren for the so-called ''Fredensborg days'' at [[Fredensborg Palace]] north of [[Copenhagen]] in the summer time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dkks.dk/christian-9-med-familie-188/|title=Christian 9. med familie, 1886

==Nicholas I of Montenegro==
[[Nicholas I of Montenegro]] (1841–1921) was the father of:
* [[Zorka of Montenegro]], who married King [[Peter I of Serbia]]
* [[Elena of Montenegro]], who married King [[Victor Emmanuel III of Italy]]
* [[Princess Anna of Montenegro|Anna of Montenegro]], who married [[Prince Francis Joseph of Battenberg]]

{{Politics of Malta}}

The '''Finance Minister of Malta''' is the head of the Ministry for Finance.

==Constitutional Functions==

The Finance Minister has an important constitutional role. This constitution assigns the exclusive competence to the Finance Minister to initiate a legislative bill on financial measures. This means that financial measures cannot be introduced through a private member's bills amongst others. Furthermore, the constitution assigns the duty to the finance minister to lay before the [[House of Representatives of Malta|House of Representatives]] not later than thirty days after, the commencement of each financial year estimates of the revenues and expenditure of Malta for that year.

{{Politics of Gibraltar}}
The '''Gibraltar Labour Party''' was a [[political party]] in [[Gibraltar]].  They described themselves as a [[progressivism|progressive]] [[socialism|socialist]] organisation and stated that their formation was prompted by the need for a strong opposition to the government. They were founded and led by [[Daniel Feetham]], who left the [[Gibraltar Socialist Labour Party]].

[[Image:Daniel Feetham.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Ex-leader of the Gibraltar Labour Party, [[Daniel Feetham]]]]

They opposed dialogue with [[Spain]] and wanted to change the [[Constitution of Gibraltar]], and support the right of Gibraltarians to decide their own constitutional arrangements under the principle of [[self-determination]]. They were also in favour of further integration with the United Kingdom.

They had proposed policies for the improvement of the quality and availability of [[house|housing]] in Gibraltar. They proposed that no individual should serve as [[Chief Minister of Gibraltar|Chief Minister]] for more than two terms, and called for a more transparent form of [[campaign finance|funding]] of political parties.

==Elections==
In the [[Gibraltar general election, 2003|2003 General Election]] to the [[Gibraltar Parliament|Gibraltar House of Assembly]], the party won 9,445 votes [http://www.parliament.gi/images/parliamentary_election_statistics/general_election_results_by_party_independents_in_percentage_terms.pdf  (or 8.0% of the popular vote)] and no seats. This is the '''largest''' number of votes (in terms of both percentage and actual number of votes) for a Gibraltarian political party that has '''not''' won a seat in the Legislature '''throughout its electoral history'''.

==Merger==
In 2005, the Labour Party merged with the governing [[Gibraltar Social Democrats]], retaining the GSD name and leadership.&lt;ref&gt;http://thegibraltarchronicle.blogspot.com/search?q=Labour+Party&lt;/ref&gt; This move was deeply unpopular with many, especially within the GSD, and caused many high-profile members to leave, including GSD Deputy Leader and former Deputy Chief Minister [[Keith Azopardi]] and executive member [[Nick Cruz]], who both went on to form the [[Progressive Democratic Party (Gibraltar)|Progressive Democratic Party]] in 2006.

'''Grafotechna''' (Grafotechna n. p., Závod 5, Výroba písma, mosazných linek a matric) was a Czechoslovak type foundry, created in 1951. It ceased to exist after 1990. It was the only manufacturer of [[moveable type|metal types]] in the former [[Czechoslovakia]].

Among other things, it manufactured fonts designed by Czech type designers [[Oldřich Menhart]] and [[Josef Týfa]].

==Typefaces==
These foundry types were produced by Grafotechna:&lt;ref&gt;Jaspert, W. Pincus, W. Turner Berry and A.F. Johnson. ''The Encyclopedia of Type Faces.'' Blandford Press Lts.: 1953, 1983, {{ISBN|0-7137-1347-X}}, p. 2408-249&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2018">'''Guy I de Balliol''' was a [[Picardy|Picard]] baron who was granted land in northern [[England]] in the late eleventh-century. In the 1090s, he was established in the north of England by King [[William Rufus]], as part of King William's carve-up of the forfeited [[Earl of Northumbria|earldom of Northumberland]].&lt;ref name=Stell-Bernard&gt;Stell, "Balliol, Bernard de".&lt;/ref&gt;

According to historian Frank Barlow, Balliol's dynasty was one of those that "originated in the reign" and were "planted ... in the frontier areas in order to protect and advance the kingdom".&lt;ref&gt;Barlow, ''William Rufus'', p. 172.&lt;/ref&gt; Geoffrey Stell said that Guy's northern territories were given "almost certainly in return for support rendered in William's campaigns on the eastern frontier of Normandy in 1091 and 1094".&lt;ref name=Stell-Bernard/&gt;

Guy himself originated in a frontier area, coming from [[Bailleul-en-Vimeu]] close to [[Abbeville]] on the frontier of the [[Count of Ponthieu|county of Ponthieu]] with the [[Duke of Normandy|duchy of Normandy]].&lt;ref name=Stell-Bernard/&gt; Guy's nephew [[Bernard I de Balliol]] succeeded to Guy's estates before 1130 × 1133, meaning that Guy had died by then.&lt;ref name=Stell-Bernard/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2634">The '''Halloween massacre''' (also known as the '''Three Day War''') refers to events which took place from October 30 to November 1, 1992 in [[Luanda]], [[Angola]] as part of the [[Angolan Civil War]].&lt;ref name=Dictionary&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=V_qm7zPo87oC&amp;pg=PA33&amp;lpg=PA33&amp;dq=Angola+Halloween+Massacre&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=z4kRxXc_VX&amp;sig=tcCDQm2tGVKOk4AFFfvAOtUCGnE&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ct=result#PPA67,M1 Historical Dictionary of Angola by W. Martin James, Susan Herlin Broadhead] on Google Books&lt;/ref&gt;

==Context==
The Halloween massacre took place following the [[Angolan presidential election, 1992|1992 presidential and legislative elections]], which were the first in the country's history. The government party, the People's Movement for the Liberation of Angola ([[MPLA]]), claimed victory in these elections. The opposition movement turned political party, National Union for the Total Independence of Angola ([[UNITA]]), questioned the fairness of the election.  Because neither the MPLA nor UNITA obtained the required absolute majority of the presidential election, a follow-up election was necessary according to the constitution.

==Events==
As both sides heightened war rhetoric, the MPLA attacked UNITA positions in Luanda. Fighting ensued, leading to the deaths of many prominent UNITA officials, including [[Jeremias Chitunda]], [[Elias Salupeto Pena]] and [[Aliceres Mango]], who were pulled from their vehicle and shot dead.&lt;ref name=Dictionary/&gt; Thousands of UNITA and [[National Liberation Front of Angola]] (FNLA) voters were massacred nationwide by MPLA forces over three days.&lt;ref name=Multiple1992&gt;National Society for Human Rights, ''Ending the Angolan Conflict'', Windhoek, Namibia, July 3, 2000; NSHR, Press Releases, September 12, 2000, May 16, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Results==
Over 10,000 UNITA and FNLA followers were killed by MPLA forces,&lt;ref name=Multiple1992&gt;National Society for Human Rights, ''Ending the Angolan Conflict'', Windhoek, Namibia, July 3, 2000; NSHR, Press Releases, September 12, 2000, May 16, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; mostly of the [[Ovimbundu]] and [[Bakongo]] ethnic groups.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cidcm.umd.edu/mar/chronology.asp?groupId=54001 Chronology for Bakongo in Angola]&lt;/ref&gt; Other estimates, based on church figures, estimate 25,000 to 40,000 UNITA and FNLA supporters were killed.&lt;ref name=Dictionary/&gt;

'''"Há sempre alguém"''' ("There's always someone") was the [[Portugal|Portuguese]] entry in the [[Eurovision Song Contest 1990]], performed in [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] by [[Nucha (singer)|Nucha]].

In the song, Nucha reminds her listeners that "There's always someone/Who still doesn't have as much as we do" but who also dreams the same dreams that the better-off members of society do.

The song was performed sixteenth on the night, following [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]]'s [[Tatiana Cameron|Tajči]] with "[[Hajde da ludujemo]]" and preceding [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]]'s [[Liam Reilly]] with "[[Somewhere in Europe (song)|Somewhere in Europe]]". At the close of voting, it had received 9 points, placing 20th in a field of 22.

It was succeeded as [[Portugal in the Eurovision Song Contest|Portuguese representative]] at the [[Eurovision Song Contest 1991|1991 Contest]] by [[Dulce Pontes|Dulce]] with "[[Lusitana paixão]]".

'''IFRS 9''' is an [[International Financial Reporting Standard]] (IFRS) promulgated by the [[International Accounting Standards Board]] (IASB).  It addresses the accounting for [[financial instrument]]s.  It contains three main topics: classification and measurement of financial instruments, [[Revaluation of fixed assets|impairment]] of [[financial asset]]s and [[hedge accounting]].  It will replace the earlier IFRS for financial instruments, [[IAS 39]], when it becomes effective in 2018. However, early adoption is allowed.

==History==
IFRS 9 began as a joint project with the [[Financial Accounting Standards Board]] (FASB), which promulgates accounting standards in the United States.  The boards published a joint discussion paper in March 2008 proposing an eventual goal of reporting all financial instruments at [[fair value]], with all changes in fair value reported in [[net income]] (FASB) or [[net income|profit and loss]] (IASB).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Reducing Complexity in Reporting Financial Instruments|url=http://www.fasb.org/cs/BlobServer?blobkey=id&amp;blobnocache=true&amp;blobwhere=1175827496152&amp;blobheader=application%2Fpdf&amp;blobheadername2=Content-Length&amp;blobheadername1=Content-Disposition&amp;blobheadervalue2=803637&amp;blobheadervalue1=filename%3DITC_Financial_Instruments.pdf&amp;blobcol=urldata&amp;blobtable=MungoBlobs|publisher=[[FASB]]|accessdate=2014-08-31|date=March 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As a result of the [[financial crisis of 2008]], the boards decided to revise their accounting standards for financial instruments to address perceived deficiencies which were believed to have contributed to the magnitude of the crisis.&lt;ref name=ifrs9&gt;{{cite web|title=IFRS 9 Financial Instruments (replacement of IAS 39)|url=http://www.ifrs.org/current-projects/iasb-projects/financial-instruments-a-replacement-of-ias-39-financial-instruments-recognitio/Pages/financial-instruments-replacement-of-ias-39.aspx|publisher=[[IASB]]|accessdate=2014-08-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The boards disagreed on several important issues, and also took different approaches to developing the new financial instruments standard.&lt;ref name=insurance/&gt;  FASB attempted to develop a comprehensive standard that would address classification and measurement, impairment and hedge accounting at the same time, and issued an exposure draft of a standard addressing all three components in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Accounting for Financial Instruments and Revisions to the Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities|url=http://www.fasb.org/cs/BlobServer?blobkey=id&amp;blobnocache=true&amp;blobwhere=1175823559151&amp;blobheader=application%2Fpdf&amp;blobheadername2=Content-Length&amp;blobheadername1=Content-Disposition&amp;blobheadervalue2=842688&amp;blobheadervalue1=filename%3DProposed_ASU_Derivatives_and_Hedging__Topic_815___and_Financial_Instruments__Topic_825_.pdf&amp;blobcol=urldata&amp;blobtable=MungoBlobs|date=May 2010|publisher=[[FASB]]|accessdate=2014-08-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=insurance&gt;{{cite news|title=GAAP/IFRS Accounting Projects—More Than Just Insurance Contracts|author=Reback, L.J.|pages=12–14|newspaper=The Financial Reporter|publisher=[[Society of Actuaries]]|date=December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In contrast, the IASB attempted to develop the new standard in phases, releasing each component of the new standard separately.&lt;ref name=insurance/&gt;&lt;ref name=kpmg1&gt;{{cite web|title=First Impressions: IFRS 9 Financial Instruments|publisher=[[KPMG]]|url=http://www.kpmg.com/Global/en/IssuesAndInsights/ArticlesPublications/first-impressions/Documents/First-Impressions-IFRS-9-Financial-Instruments.pdf|date=December 2009|accessdate=2014-08-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2009, IASB issued the first portion of IFRS, covering classification and measurement of financial assets.&lt;ref name=kpmg1/&gt;&lt;ref name=deloitte1&gt;{{cite news|title=IASB issues IFRS 9 'Financial Instruments'|publisher=[[Deloitte]]|url=http://www.iasplus.com/en/news/2009/November/news5269|date=12 November 2009|accessdate=2014-08-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This was intended to replace the asset classification and measurement sections of IAS 39, but not supersede other sections of IAS 39.&lt;ref name=kpmg1/&gt;&lt;ref name=deloitte1/&gt;  In 2010, IASB issued another portion of IFRS 9, primarily covering classification and measurement of financial liabilities and also addressing aspects of applying [[fair value option]] and bifurcating [[derivative (finance)|embedded derivatives]].&lt;ref name=kpmg2&gt;{{cite web|title=First Impressions: Additions to IFRS 9 Financial Instruments|url=http://www.kpmg.com/Global/en/IssuesAndInsights/ArticlesPublications/first-impressions/Documents/IFRS-9-additions-dec-2010.pdf|publisher=[[KPMG]]|date=December 2010|accessdate=2014-08-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=IASB issues additions to IFRS 9 for financial liability accounting|publisher=[[Deloitte]]|url=http://www.iasplus.com/en/news/2010/October/news6194|date=28 October 2010|accessdate=2014-08-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Certain elements of IFRS 9 as issued were criticized by some key IASB constituents.  The model for classifying [[debt|debt instrument]] assets permitted only two approaches, fair value with all changes in fair value reported in profit and loss (FVPL), or [[amortized cost]].&lt;ref name=2012ed/&gt;  This represented a significant deviation from FASB decisions, which would also have a category of fair value with certain changes in fair value reported in [[other comprehensive income]] (FVOCI).&lt;ref name=insurance/&gt;  In addition to creating significant divergence with FASB, the lack of a FVOCI category would have been inconsistent with the accounting model being developed by the IASB for insurance contracts.&lt;ref name=2012ed/&gt;&lt;ref name=ey/&gt;&lt;ref name=insurance/&gt;  There were also concerns that the criteria for qualifying for the amortized cost category were overly stringent and would force many financial instruments to be reported at fair value even though they could be appropriately accounted for at amortized cost.&lt;ref name=2012ed/&gt;  To address these concerns, IASB issued an exposure draft in 2012 proposing limited amendments to the classification and measurement of financial instruments.&lt;ref name=2012ed&gt;{{cite web|title=Exposure Draft and Comment letters 2012|url=http://www.ifrs.org/Current-Projects/IASB-Projects/Financial-Instruments-A-Replacement-of-IAS-39-Financial-Instruments-Recognitio/Limited-modifications-to-IFRS-9/Exposure-Draft-and-comment-letters-Nov-2012/Pages/ED-and-CL-November-2012.aspx|publisher=[[IASB]]|date=November 2012|accessdate=2014-08-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, IASB and FASB worked together to develop a model for impairment of financial assets.  IASB issued an exposure draft proposing an impairment model in 2013.&lt;ref name=impairment&gt;{{cite web|title=Exposure Draft and Comment letters|url=http://www.ifrs.org/Current-Projects/IASB-Projects/Financial-Instruments-A-Replacement-of-IAS-39-Financial-Instruments-Recognitio/Impairment/Exposure-Draft-March-2013/Pages/ED-and-Comment-letters.aspx|publisher=[[IASB]]|date=March 2013|accessdate=2014-08-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;  FASB decided to propose an alternative impairment model.&lt;ref name=impairment/&gt;  IASB was also developing its hedge accounting model independently of FASB, and issued that portion of the IFRS 9 standard in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=IASB completes important steps in reform of financial instruments accounting|date=19 November 2013|publisher=[[IASB]]|url=http://www.ifrs.org/Current-Projects/IASB-Projects/Financial-Instruments-A-Replacement-of-IAS-39-Financial-Instruments-Recognitio/Phase-III-Hedge-accounting/Project-news/Pages/Project-update-November-2013.aspx|accessdate=2014-08-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The final IFRS 9 standard, including hedge accounting, impairment, and the amended classification and measurement guidance, was issued on 24 July 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=IASB completes reform of financial instruments accounting|url=http://www.ifrs.org/Alerts/PressRelease/Pages/IASB-completes-reform-of-financial-instruments-accounting-July-2014.aspx|date=24 July 2014|publisher=[[IASB]]|accessdate=2014-08-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Early evidence on the market reaction to the IFRS 9 in Europe suggests overall a positive response to the IFRS 9, although heterogeneities across countries exist.&lt;ref name=JAPP2014&gt;{{cite journal|title= Onali, E.; Ginesti, G. (2014). Pre-adoption market reaction to IFRS 9: A cross-country event study. ''Journal of Accounting and Public Policy'', forthcoming | url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0278425414000696 | doi=10.1016/j.jaccpubpol.2014.08.004 | volume=33 | issue=6 | journal=Journal of Accounting and Public Policy | pages=628–637| date=November 2014 | last1=Onali | first1=Enrico | last2=Ginesti | first2=Gianluca }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Classification and measurement==
As amended, IFRS 9 had four possible classification categories for financial assets, including a FVOCI classification for debt instruments.&lt;ref name=ey&gt;{{cite web|title=IASB issues IFRS 9 Financial Instruments – classification and measurement|url=http://www.ey.com/Publication/vwLUAssets/EY-ifrs-developments-issue-86-july2014/$File/EY-ifrs-developments-issue-86-july2014.pdf|publisher=[[Ernst &amp; Young]]|date=July 2014|accessdate=2014-08-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The classification is dependent on two tests, a contractual cash flow test (named SPPI as Solely Payments of Principal and Interest) and a business model  assessment.&lt;ref name=ey/&gt;&lt;ref name=dt&gt;{{cite news|title=IASB publishes final version of IFRS 9|url=http://www.iasplus.com/en-us/news/2014/07/ifrs-9|publisher=[[Deloitte]]|date=24 July 2014|accessdate=2014-08-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Unless the asset meets the requirements of both tests, it is measured at fair value with all changes in fair value reporting in profit and loss (FVPL).&lt;ref name=ey/&gt;  In order to meet the contractual cash flow test, the cash flows from the instrument must consist of only [[principal (finance)|principal]] and [[interest]].&lt;ref name=ey/&gt;  Among the amendments to classification and measurement made in the 2014 update, ''de minimis'' and "non-genuine" features can be disregarded from the test, meaning that a ''de minimis'' feature would not preclude an instrument from being reported at amortized cost or FVOCI.&lt;ref name=ey/&gt;  However, [[equity (finance)|equity]] instruments, [[derivative (finance)|derivatives]] and instruments that contain other than ''de minimis'' embedded derivatives would have to be reported at FVPL.&lt;ref name=ey/&gt;

If the asset passes the contractual cash flows test, the business model assessment determines how the instrument is classified.  If the instrument is being held to collect contractual cash flows, i.e., it is not expected to be sold, it is classified as amortized cost.&lt;ref name=ey/&gt;  If the business model for the instrument is to both collect contractual cash flows and potentially sell the asset, it is reported at FVOCI.&lt;ref name=ey/&gt;&lt;ref name=dt/&gt;  For a FVOCI asset, the amortized cost basis is used to determine profit and loss, but the asset is reported at fair value on the [[balance sheet]], with the difference between amortized cost and fair value reported in [[other comprehensive income]].&lt;ref name=dt/&gt;  For any other business model, such as holding the asset for trading, the asset is reported at FVPL.&lt;ref name=ey/&gt;

IFRS 9 retained most of the measurement guidance for liabilities from IAS 39, meaning most financial liabilities are held at amortized cost,&lt;ref name=ey/&gt; the only change relating to liabilities that utilize the fair value option.&lt;ref name=ey/&gt;  For those liabilities, the change in fair value related to the entity's own credit standing is reported in other comprehensive income rather than profit and loss.&lt;ref name=ey/&gt;

IFRS 9 retained the concept of fair value option from IAS 39, but revised the criteria for financial assets.&lt;ref name=ey/&gt;&lt;ref name=dt/&gt;  Under a fair value option, an asset or liability that would otherwise be reported at amortized cost or FVOCI can use FVPL instead.  IFRS 9 also incorporated a FVOCI option for certain equity instruments that are not held for trading.&lt;ref name=ey/&gt;  Under this option, the instrument is reported at FVOCI similar to FVOCI for debt.  However, this version of FVOCI does not permit "recycling."&lt;ref name=ey/&gt;  Whereas when debt instruments using FVOCI are sold, the gain or loss on sale is "recycled" from other comprehensive income to profit and loss,&lt;ref name=dt/&gt; for FVOCI equities the gain or loss is never reported in profit and loss, but rather remains in other comprehensive income.

==Impairment==
IFRS 9 requires an impairment allowance against the amortized cost of financial assets held at amortized cost or FVOCI.&lt;ref name=dt/&gt;  The change in this allowance is reported in profit and loss.&lt;ref name=dt/&gt;  For most such assets, when the asset is acquired the impairment allowance is measured as the [[present value]] of credit losses from default events projected over the next 12 months.&lt;ref name=dt/&gt;  The allowance remains based on the expected losses from defaults over the next 12 months unless there is a significant increase in credit risk.&lt;ref name=dt/&gt;  If there is a significant increase in credit risk, the allowance is measured as the present value of all credit losses projected for the instrument over its full lifetime.&lt;ref name=dt/&gt;  If the credit risk recovers, the allowance can once again be limited to the projected credit losses over the next 12 months.&lt;ref name=kpmg3&gt;{{cite web|title=Financial instruments - the complete standard|url=http://www.kpmg.com/Global/en/IssuesAndInsights/ArticlesPublications/In-the-Headlines/Documents/ITH-2014-13.pdf|publisher=[[KPMG]]|date=July 2014|accessdate=2014-08-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An exception to the general impairment model applies to financial assets that are credit impaired when they were originally acquired.&lt;ref name=dt/&gt;  For these assets, the impairment allowance is always based on the change in projected lifetime credit losses since the asset was acquired.&lt;ref name=dt/&gt;

The new impairment model is intended to address a criticism of the impairment model used during the financial crisis, that it allowed companies to delay recognition of asset impairments.&lt;ref name=ifrs9/&gt;  The new model requires recognition of full lifetime losses more quickly,&lt;ref name=ifrs9/&gt;  FASB elected to use a different approach to accelerating recognition of impairment losses, requiring full lifetime recognition from the time the asset is acquired, referred to as the "current expected credit losses" or CECL model.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Accounting for Financial Instruments—Credit Impairment—Joint Project of the FASB and IASB|url=http://www.fasb.org/jsp/FASB/FASBContent_C/ProjectUpdatePage&amp;cid=1176159268094|publisher=[[FASB]]|accessdate=2014-08-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Under both IFRS 9 and the FASB model there will be a loss when most assets covered by this guidance are acquired to the extent of the allowance.&lt;ref name=insurance2&gt;{{cite news|title=FASB and IASB Divergence|author=Reback, L.J.|date=June 2014|newspaper=The Financial Reporter|publisher=[[Society of Actuaries]]|pages=22–24}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This loss will be smaller under the IFRS 9 model, due to the 12 month limit.&lt;ref name=insurance2/&gt;

==Hedge accounting==
IFRS 9 updated the guidance for hedge accounting. The intent was to "[align] the accounting treatment with risk management activities, enabling entities to reflect better these activities in their financial statements."&lt;ref name=ifrs9/&gt;  The changes also make it more feasible for non-financial entities to use hedge accounting.&lt;ref name=ey2&gt;{{cite web|title=Hedge accounting under IFRS 9|url=http://www.ey.com/Publication/vwLUAssets/Applying_IFRS:_Hedge_accounting_under_IFRS_9/$File/Applying_Hedging_Feb2014.pdf|publisher=[[Ernst &amp; Young]]|date=February 2014|accessdate=2014-08-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The changes permit more use of hedge accounting for components of instruments and groups of contracts, and ease the hedge effectiveness test.&lt;ref name=ey2/&gt;  They also enhance the disclosures related to hedges and risk management with a requirement to refer to a formal risk management strategy or describe it clearly in the hedge documentation.&lt;ref name=ifrs9/&gt;&lt;ref name=ey2/&gt;

The '''Independent Grouping for Reflection''' ({{lang-fr|Groupement Indépendant de Reflexion}}, GIR) was a [[political party]] in the [[Central African Republic]]. The GIR was led by [[François Pehoua]], a former minister in the [[Bokassa]] cabinet. Pehoua was the GIR candidate in the [[Central African Republic presidential election, 1981|1981 presidential elections]], finishing third of five candidates with 5% of the vote. GIR was generally based amongst bureaucrats and technocrats.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas O'Toole (1986) ''The Central African Republic: The Continent's Hidden Heart'', Westview Press&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''International Association for Suicide Prevention''' (IASP) is an international [[suicide prevention]] organization. Founded by [[Erwin Ringel]] and [[Norman Farberow]] in 1960, IASP, which is in an official relationship with the [[World Health Organization]], is dedicated to preventing suicidal behaviour and providing a forum for mental health professionals, crisis workers, [[suicide survivor]]s and other people in one way or another affected by suicidal behaviour. The organization now consists of professionals and volunteers from over 50 countries worldwide.

The IASP also co-sponsors [[World Suicide Prevention Day]] on September 10 every year, with the World Health Organization.

==IASP Congresses==

The IASP holds international congresses every two years. XXIX World Congress of the IASP will be organized in [[Kuching]] (Malaysia) in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.iasp.info/congresses.php&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Joliot-Curie Metro Station''' ({{lang-bg|Метростанция "Жолио Кюри"}}) is a station on the [[Sofia Metro]] in [[Bulgaria]].  It was put into operation on May 8, 2009.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.novinite.com/view_news.php?id=103398&lt;/ref&gt;

==Public Transportation==
* [[Public buses in Sofia|City Bus service]]: 413
* [[Public buses in Sofia|Suburban Bus service]]: 67

==Location==
The station is under [[Dragan Tsankov Boulevard]] at the intersection with Frederic Joliot-Curie Str. It is located next to the [[Interpred World Trade Center Sofia|World Trade Center - Sofia]], near the Russian Embassy.

The station serves Iztok and Izgrev residential districts and the Southern Bus Station. It is defined by a central entrance vestibule with underpass links to both sides of the boulevard and the surrounding residential areas.

The entrance vestibule and ramp of the station are covered with granite tiles and have suspended ceilings. The entire station was designed in vibrant colors: the platforms are covered with colored granite tiles and the walls have panels of circular red mosaic designs set on white tiles. The walls behind the panels are covered with a light blue mosaic.

Because of the route specifics, the station's platforms enter a maximum curve.

It was a successor state of the [[County of Sicily]], which had been founded in 1071 during the [[Norman conquest of southern Italy|Norman conquest of the southern peninsula]]. The island was divided into [[Three valli of Sicily|three regions]]: Val di Mazara, Val Demone and Val di Noto; 'val' being the Arabic word meaning 'district'.

In 1282, a revolt against [[Capetian House of Anjou|Angevin]] rule, known as the [[Sicilian Vespers]], threw off [[Charles of Anjou]]'s rule of the island of Sicily. The Angevins managed to maintain control in the mainland part of the kingdom, which became a separate entity also styled ''Kingdom of Sicily'', although it is commonly referred to as the [[Kingdom of Naples]], after its capital. The island became a separate kingdom under the [[Crown of Aragon]].

After 1302 the island kingdom was sometimes called the '''Kingdom of Trinacria'''.&lt;ref name="jws"&gt;{{Cite book|author=N. Zeldes |title=The former Jews of this kingdom: Sicilian converts after the Expulsion, 1492–1516 |year=2003 |pages=5, 69, 296–97|publisher=BRILL |isbn=90-04-12898-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Often the kingship was vested in another monarch such as the [[King of Aragon]], the [[King of Spain]], or the [[Holy Roman Emperor]]. In 1816 the island Kingdom of Sicily merged with the Kingdom of Naples to form the [[Kingdom of the Two Sicilies]]. In 1861 the Two Sicilies were amalgamated with Sardinia and several northern city-states and duchies to form the [[Kingdom of Italy (1861–1946)|Kingdom of Italy]].

== History ==

===Norman conquest===
{{main|Emirate of Sicily|Norman conquest of southern Italy}}
By the 11th century mainland southern [[Duchy of Benevento|Lombard]] and [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] powers were hiring Norman mercenaries, who were descendants of the [[Vikings]]; it was the Normans under [[Roger I of Sicily|Roger I]] who conquered Sicily, taking it away from the Arab Muslims. After taking [[Apulia]] and [[Calabria]], Roger occupied [[Messina]] with an army of 700 knights. In 1068, [[Roger I of Sicily]] and his men defeated the Muslims at [[Misilmeri]] but the most crucial battle was the siege of Palermo, which led to Sicily being completely under Norman control by 1091.&lt;ref name="initalymag"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.initaly.com/regions/sicily/chronol.htm|publisher=In Italy Magazine|title=Chronological - Historical Table Of Sicily|date=7 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Regnonormanno1160.jpg|thumb|left|300px|Maximal expansion of the Kingdom of Sicily.]]
The [[Italo-Normans|Norman]] Kingdom was created on Christmas Day, 1130, by [[Roger II of Sicily|Roger&amp;nbsp;II of Sicily]], with the agreement of [[Pope Innocent II]], who united the lands Roger had inherited from his father [[Roger I of Sicily|Roger&amp;nbsp;I of Sicily]].&lt;ref&gt;Douglas, David. ''The Norman Fate, 1100-1154''. Los Angeles: [[University of California Press]], 1976.&lt;/ref&gt; These areas included the [[Malta (island)|Maltese Archipelago]], which was conquered from the [[Emirate of Sicily|Arabs of the Emirates of Sicily]]; the [[Duchy of Apulia]] and the [[County of Sicily]], which had belonged to his cousin [[William II, Duke of Apulia|William&amp;nbsp;II, Duke of Apulia]], until William's death in 1127; and the other Norman vassals. Roger threw his support behind the [[Antipope Anacletus II|Antipope Anacletus&amp;nbsp;II]], who enthroned him as King of Sicily on Christmas Day 1130.&lt;ref name="houben"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Houben |first=Hubert |title=Roger II of Sicily: A Ruler between East and West |year=2002|pages=7, 148 |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|isbn=0-521-65573-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1136, the rival of Anacletus, [[Pope Innocent II|Pope Innocent&amp;nbsp;II]], convinced [[Lothair III, Holy Roman Emperor|Lothair&amp;nbsp;III, Holy Roman Emperor]] to attack the Kingdom of Sicily with help from the [[Byzantine Emperor]] [[John II Comnenus|John&amp;nbsp;II Comnenus]]. Two main armies, one led by Lothair, the other by [[Duke of Bavaria]] [[Henry the Proud]], invaded Sicily. On the river [[Tronto]], [[William of Loritello]] surrendered to Lothair and opened the gates of Termoli to him.&lt;ref name="nrki"/&gt; This was followed by Count Hugh&amp;nbsp;II of Molise. The two armies were united at [[Bari]], from where in 1137 they continued their campaign. Roger offered to give Apulia as a [[fief]] to the Empire, which Lothair refused after being pressured by Innocent. At the same period the army of Lothair revolted.&lt;ref name="houben"/&gt;&lt;ref name="twc"/&gt;

Then Lothair, who had hoped for the complete conquest of Sicily, gave [[Capua]] and Apulia from the Kingdom of Sicily to Roger's enemies. Innocent protested, claiming that Apulia fell under papal claims. Lothair turned north, but died while crossing the Alps on December 4, 1137. At the [[Second Council of the Lateran]] in April 1139, Innocent excommunicated Roger for maintaining a [[Schism (religion)|schismatic]] attitude. On March 22, 1139, at Galluccio, Roger's son [[Roger III, Duke of Apulia|Roger&amp;nbsp;III, Duke of Apulia]] ambushed the papal troops with a thousand knights and captured the pope.&lt;ref name="twc"&gt;{{Cite book|author=Malcolm Barber |title=The two cities: medieval Europe, 1050–1320 |year=2004 |page=211 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=0-415-17414-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On March 25, 1139, Innocent was forced to acknowledge the kingship and possessions of Roger with the [[Treaty of Mignano]].&lt;ref name="houben"/&gt;&lt;ref name="twc"/&gt;

Roger spent most of the decade, beginning with his coronation and ending with the [[Assizes of Ariano]], enacting a series of laws with which Roger intended to centralise the government, fending off multiple invasions and quelling rebellions by his premier vassals: [[Grimoald of Bari]], [[Robert II of Capua|Robert&amp;nbsp;II of Capua]], [[Ranulf of Alife]], [[Sergius VII of Naples|Sergius&amp;nbsp;VII of Naples]] and others.

It was through his admiral [[George of Antioch]] that Roger then proceeded to conquer the littoral of [[Ifriqiya]] from the [[Zirid dynasty|Zirids]], taking the unofficial title "[[Kingdom of Africa|King of Africa]]" and marking the foundation of the Norman Kingdom of Africa. At the same time Roger's fleet also attacked the [[Byzantine Empire]], making Sicily a leading maritime power in the [[Mediterranean Sea]] for almost a century.&lt;ref name="houben"/&gt;

Roger's son and successor was [[William I of Sicily|William&amp;nbsp;I of Sicily]], known as "William the Bad", though his nickname derived primarily from his lack of popularity with the chroniclers, who supported the baronial revolts which William suppressed. In the mid-1150s, William lost the majority of his African possessions to a series of revolts from local North African lords. Then, in 1160, the final Norman African stronghold of Mahdia was taken by [[Almohads]]. His reign ended in peace (1166), but with his elder son [[Roger IV, Duke of Apulia|Roger]] killed in previous revolts, his son, [[William II of Sicily|William&amp;nbsp;II]], was a minor. Until the end of the boy's [[Regent|regency]] in 1172, the kingdom saw turmoil which almost brought the ruling family down. The reign of William II is remembered as two decades of almost continual peace and prosperity. For this more than anything, he is nicknamed "the Good". He died in 1189 without having heirs, which led the kingdom to decline.&lt;ref name="nrki"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Norman kingdom of Sicily |author=Donald Matthew|year=1992|pages=4–6, 71–74, 86–92, 285, 286, 304, |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|isbn=0-521-26911-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

William II had named his aunt [[Constance of Sicily|Constance]], the daughter of Roger II who married future [[Henry VI, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry&amp;nbsp;VI, Holy Roman Emperor]] his heiress. As the noblemen did not want to be ruled by a German, [[Tancred of Lecce]] seized the throne under their support, but he had to contend with the revolt of his distant cousin [[Roger of Andria]] and the invasion of Henry on behalf of his wife. Initially Roger was tricked into execution and Henry had to retreat after his attack failed, with Constance even captured and only released under the pressure of the Pope. Tancred died in 1194, and Constance and Henry eventually prevailed and the kingdom fell in 1194 to the [[House of Hohenstaufen]], with [[William III of Sicily]] the young son of Tancred deposed. Henry and Constance were crowned as king and queen. Through Constance, the [[Hauteville family|Hauteville]] blood was passed to [[Frederick I of Sicily|Frederick&amp;nbsp;II, Holy Roman Emperor]].&lt;ref name="nrki"/&gt;

The accession of Frederick, a child who would then become also the [[Holy Roman Emperor Frederick II|Holy Roman Emperor Frederick&amp;nbsp;II]] in 1197, greatly affected the immediate future of Sicily. For a land so used to centralised royal authority, the king's young age caused a serious power vacuum. His uncle [[Philip of Swabia]] moved to secure Frederick's inheritance by appointing [[Markward von Anweiler]], [[margrave]] of [[Ancona]], regent in 1198. Meanwhile, [[Pope Innocent III|Pope Innocent&amp;nbsp;III]] had reasserted papal authority in Sicily, but recognised Frederick's rights. The pope was to see papal power decrease steadily over the next decade and was unsure about which side to back at many junctures.&lt;ref name="hoh"/&gt;

The Hohenstaufen's grip on power, however, was not secure. [[Walter III of Brienne|Walter&amp;nbsp;III of Brienne]] had married the daughter of [[Tancred of Sicily]]. She was sister and heiress of the deposed King William III of Sicily. In 1201 William decided to claim the kingdom. In 1202, an army led by the chancellor [[Walter of Palearia]] and [[Dipold of Vohburg]] was defeated by Walter III of Brienne. Markward was killed, and Frederick fell under the control of [[William of Capparone]], an ally of the [[Pisa]]ns. Dipold continued the war against Walter on the mainland until the claimant's death in 1205. Dipold finally wrested Frederick from Capparone in 1206 and gave him over to the guardianship of the chancellor, Walter of Palearia. Walter and Dipold then had a falling out, and the latter captured the royal palace, where he was besieged and captured by Walter in 1207. After a decade, the wars over the regency and the throne itself had ceased.&lt;ref name="nrki"/&gt;

The reform of the laws began with the [[Assizes of Ariano]] in 1140 by [[Roger II of Sicily|Roger&amp;nbsp;II]]. Frederick continued the reformation with the [[Assizes of Capua]] (1220) and the promulgation of the [[Constitutions of Melfi]] (1231, also known as ''[[Liber Augustalis]]''), a collection of laws for his realm that was remarkable for its time.&lt;ref name="hoh"/&gt; The Constitutions of Melfi were created in order to establish a centralized state. For example, citizens were not allowed to carry weapons or wear armour in public unless they were under royal command.&lt;ref name="hoh"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Italian medieval armies 1000–1300 |author=David Nicolle |year=2002 |pages=5–10, 18–19, 34 |publisher=Osprey Publishing |isbn=1-84176-322-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, rebellions were reduced. The Constitutions made the Kingdom of Sicily an [[absolute monarchy]], the first centralized [[Sovereign state|state]] in Europe to emerge from [[feudalism]]; it also set a precedent for the primacy of written law.&lt;ref name="twc"/&gt; With relatively small modifications, the ''Liber Augustalis'' remained the basis of Sicilian law until 1819.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=James Ross Sweeney, Stanley Chodorow |title=Popes, teachers, and canon law in the Middle Ages |year=1989 |publisher=[[Cornell University Press]] |isbn=0-8014-2264-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this period, he also built the [[Castel del Monte (Apulia)|Castel del Monte]], and in 1224, he founded the [[University of Naples]], now called [[Università Federico II|Università Federico&amp;nbsp;II]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=Hunt Janin |title=The University in Medieval Life, 1179–1499 |year=2008 |page=132 |publisher=McFarland |isbn=0-7864-3462-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; It remained the sole athenaeum of southern Italy for centuries.

After the death of Frederick, the Kingdom was ruled by [[Henry VII of Germany|Henry&amp;nbsp;VII of Germany]] and [[Conrad IV of Germany|Conrad&amp;nbsp;IV of Germany]]. The next legitimate heir was [[Conradin|Conrad&amp;nbsp;II]], who was too young at the period to rule. Manfred of Sicily, the illegitimate son of Frederick, took the power and ruled the kingdom for fifteen years while other Hohenstaufen heirs were ruling various areas in Germany.&lt;ref name="hoh"/&gt; After long wars against the [[Papal States]], the Kingdom managed to defend its possessions, but the [[Papacy]] declared the Kingdom escheated because of disloyalty of the Hohenstaufen.&lt;ref name="magcar"/&gt; Under this pretext he came to an agreement with [[Louis IX|Louis&amp;nbsp;IX]], King of France. Louis's brother, [[Charles of Anjou]], would become king of Sicily.

In 1266, conflict between the Hohenstaufen house and the Papacy led to Sicily's conquest by [[Charles I of Sicily#Conquest of Sicily|Charles I]], Duke of [[Anjou]]. With the usurpation of the Sicilian throne from Conradin by [[Manfred of Sicily]] in 1258, the relationship between the Papacy and the Hohenstaufen had changed again. Instead of the boy Conradin, safely sequestered across the Alps, the Papacy now faced an able military leader who had greatly supported the [[Guelphs and Ghibellines|Ghibelline]] cause at the battle of [[Battle of Montaperti|Montaperti]] in 1260. Accordingly, when negotiations broke down with Manfred in 1262, [[Pope Urban IV]] again took up the scheme of disseising the Hohenstaufen from the kingdom, and offered the crown to [[Charles of Anjou]] again. With Papal and [[Guelphs and Ghibellines|Guelph]] support Charles descended into Italy and defeated Manfred at the battle of [[Battle of Benevento|Benevento]] in 1266 and in 1268 Conradin at the battle of [[Battle of Tagliacozzo|Taglicozzo]].

Opposition to French officialdom and taxation combined with incitement of rebellion by agents from the [[Crown of Aragon]] and the [[Byzantine Empire]] led to the successful insurrection of the [[Sicilian Vespers]] followed by the invitation and intervention by king [[Peter III of Aragon|Peter&amp;nbsp;III of Aragon]] in 1282. The resulting [[War of the Sicilian Vespers]] lasted until the [[Peace of Caltabellotta]] in 1302, dividing the old Kingdom of Sicily in two. The island of Sicily, called the "Kingdom of Sicily beyond the Lighthouse" or the Kingdom of Trinacria, went to [[Frederick III of Sicily|Frederick&amp;nbsp;III]] of the [[house of Aragon]], who had been ruling it. The peninsular territories (the [[Mezzogiorno]]), contemporaneously called Kingdom of Sicily but called [[Kingdom of Naples]] by modern scholarship, went to [[Charles II of Naples|Charles&amp;nbsp;II]] of the [[Capetian House of Anjou|house of Anjou]], who had likewise been ruling it. Thus, the peace was formal recognition of an uneasy ''status quo''.&lt;ref name="runc"/&gt; The division in the kingdom became permanent in 1372, with the [[Treaty of Villeneuve]]. Though the king of Spain was able to seize both crowns in the 16th century, the administrations of the two halves of the Kingdom of Sicily remained separated until 1816, when they were reunited in the [[Kingdom of Two Sicilies]].

===The insular kingdom of Sicily under the Crown of Aragon and Spain===
[[File:Martin1Sicilsky.jpg|thumb|right|220px|[[Martin I of Sicily|Martin I]] king of Sicily in 1390-1409.]]
Sicily was ruled as an independent kingdom by relatives or cadet branch of the house of Aragon until 1409 and thence as part of the [[Crown of Aragon]]. The Kingdom of Naples was ruled by the Angevin ruler [[René of Anjou]] until the two thrones were reunited by [[Alfonso V of Aragon|Alfonso&amp;nbsp;V of Aragon]], after the successful siege of Naples and the defeat of René on June 6, 1443.&lt;ref name="anar"&gt;{{Cite book|author = Allan W.

He gave the rule of Naples to his illegitimate son [[Ferdinand I of Naples|Ferdinand&amp;nbsp;I of Naples]], who ruled from 1458 to 1494, and the rest of the Crown of Aragon and Sicily to Alfonso's brother [[John II of Aragon|John&amp;nbsp;II of Aragon]]. From 1494 to 1503 successive kings of France [[Charles VIII of France|Charles&amp;nbsp;VIII]] and [[Louis XII|Louis&amp;nbsp;XII]], who were heirs of Angevins, tried to conquer Naples (see [[Italian Wars]]) but failed. Eventually the Kingdom of Naples was reunited with the Crown of Aragon. The titles were held by the [[List of Aragonese monarchs|Aragonese kings]] of the Crown of Aragon and Kingdom of Spain until the end of the Spanish branch of the [[House of Habsburg]] in 1700.

=== Malta under the Knights ===
{{main|History of Malta under the Order of Saint John}}
[[File:Prise de Malte en 1530.jpg|thumb|''[[Philippe Villiers de L'Isle-Adam|Philippe de Villiers de l'Isle Adam]] takes possession of the island of Malta, 26 October 1530'' by [[René Théodore Berthon]].]]
In 1530, in an effort to protect [[Rome]] from [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] invasion from the south, [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles&amp;nbsp;V, Holy Roman Emperor]], as Charles&amp;nbsp;I of Spain, gave the Islands of [[Malta]] and [[Gozo]] to the [[Knights Hospitaller]] in [[History of Malta under the Order of Saint John|perpetual fiefdom]], in exchange for an [[Tribute of the Maltese Falcon|annual fee of two Maltese falcons]], which they were to send on [[All Souls' Day]] to the [[Viceroy]] of Sicily.&lt;ref name="malgoz"&gt;{{Cite book|author=Carolyn Bain |title=Malta &amp; Gozo |year=2004 |page=23 |publisher=Lonely Planet |isbn=1-74059-178-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Maltese Islands had formed part of the County, and later the Kingdom of Sicily, since 1091. The feudal relationship between Malta and the Kingdom of Sicily was continued throughout the rule of the Knights, until the [[French occupation of Malta]] in 1798.&lt;ref name="malgoz"/&gt;

The occupation was not recognized, and Malta was ''de jure'' part of the Kingdom of Sicily from 1798 to 1814. After the [[Siege of Malta (1798–1800)|Maltese rebellion]] against the French, Malta was [[Malta Protectorate|under British protection]] until it became a [[Crown Colony of Malta|British crown colony]] in 1813. This was officially recognized by the [[Treaty of Paris (1814)|Treaty of Paris]] of 1814, which marked the end of Malta's 700-year relationship with Sicily.

===The War of the Spanish Succession===
{{main|Kingdom of Sicily under Savoy}}
From 1713 until 1720 the Kingdom of Sicily was ruled briefly by the [[House of Savoy]], which had received it by the terms of the [[Treaty of Utrecht]], which brought an end to the [[War of the Spanish Succession]]. The kingdom was a reward to the Savoyards, who were thus elevated to royal rank. The new king, [[Victor Amadeus II]], travelled to Sicily in 1713 and remained a year before returning to his mainland capital, [[Turin]], where his son [[Victor Amadeus, Prince of Piedmont|the Prince of Piedmont]] had been acting as regent. In Spain the results of the war had not been truly accepted, and the [[War of the Quadruple Alliance]] was the result. Sicily was occupied by Spain in 1718. When it became evident that Savoy had not the strength to defend as remote a country as Sicily, [[Archduchy of Austria|Austria]] stepped in and exchanged its [[Kingdom of Sardinia and Corsica|Kingdom of Sardinia]] for Sicily. Victor Amadeus protested this exchange, Sicily being a rich country of over one million inhabitants and Sardinia a poor country of a few hundred thousand, but he was unable to resist his "allies". Spain was finally defeated in 1720, and the [[Treaty of The Hague (1720)|Treaty of the Hague]] ratified the changeover. Sicily belonged to the Austrian Habsburgs, who already ruled Naples.&lt;ref name="fromr"&gt;{{Cite book|author=Danforth Prince |title=Frommer's Sicily |year=2007 |page=314 |publisher=Frommer's |isbn=0-470-10056-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Victor Amadeus, for his part, continued to protest for three years, and only in 1723 decided to recognize the exchange and desist from using the Sicilian royal title and its subsidiary titles (such as King of Cyprus and Jerusalem).

===The two kingdoms under the house of Bourbon of Spain===
[[File:Real Casina di Caccia della Ficuzza, luglio 2010.JPG|thumb|[[Royal Palace of Ficuzza]]]]
[[File:Palazzina cinese 0001.JPG|thumb|La [[Palazzina Cinese]] di Palermo, residence of Bourbon]]
In 1734, Naples was reconquered by King [[Philip V of Spain]], a Bourbon, who installed his younger son, Duke Charles of Parma, as King [[Charles III of Spain|Charles&amp;nbsp;VII of Naples]], starting a cadet branch of the [[house of Bourbon]]. Adding to his Neapolitan possessions, he became also King of Sicily with the name of Charles V of Sicily the next year after Austria gave up Sicily and her pretensions to Naples in exchange for the Duchy of Parma and the Grand-Duchy of Tuscany. This change of hands opened up a period of economic flourishing and social and political reformations, with many public projects and cultural initiatives directly started or inspired by the king. He remained King of Sicily until his accession to the Spanish throne in 1759, the treaties with Austria forbidding a union of the Italian domains with the crown of Spain. 

Charles abdicated in favour of [[Ferdinand I of the Two Sicilies|Ferdinand]], his third son, who acceded to the thrones with the names of Ferdinand IV of Naples and III of Sicily. Still a minor, Ferdinand grew up amongst pleasures and leisure while the real power was safely held by [[Bernardo Tanucci]], the president of the regency council. During this period most of the reformation process initiated by Charles came to a halt, with the king mostly absent or uninterested in the matters of state and the political helm steered by Queen Maria Carolina and prime ministers Tanucci (until 1777) and [[Jonh Francis Edward Acton|sir John Acton]]. The latter managed to disentangle Naples and Sicily from the influence of Spain and Austria and to place them nearer to Great Britain, then represented by ambassador [[William Hamilton (diplomat)|sir William Hamilton]]. This is the period of the Grand Tour, and Sicily with its many natural and historical attractions is visited by a score of intellectuals from all over Europe that on one side bring to the island the winds of the Enlightenment, and on the other side will spread the fame of its beauty in the continent.      
 
In 1799 Napoleon conquered Naples, forcing king Ferdinand and the court to flee to Sicily under the protection of the British fleet under the command of Horatio Nelson. While Naples was formed into the [[Parthenopaean Republic]] with French support and later again a kingdom under French protection and influence, Sicily became the British base of operation in the Mediterranean in the long struggle against Napoleon. Under [[British Empire|British]] guidance, especially from [[Lord William Bentinck]] who was commander of British troops in Sicily, Sicily tried to modernise its constitutional apparatus, forcing the King to ratify a Constitution moulded over the British system. &lt;ref name="fromr"/&gt; The island was under British occupation from 1806-14.&lt;ref&gt;W. H. Clements, "The Defences of Sicily, 1806-1815," ''Journal of the Society for Army Historical Research,'' Autumn 2009, Vol. 87 Issue 351, pp 256-272&lt;/ref&gt; The main feature of the new system was that a two-chamber parliament was formed (instead of the three of the existing one). The formation of the parliament brought the end of [[feudalism]] in the Kingdom. 

After the defeat of [[Napoleon]] in 1815 Ferdinand repealed all reforms and even cancelled the Kingdom of Sicily from the map (after a history of 800 years) with the creation of the brand-new [[Kingdom of the Two Sicilies]] with capital Naples in 1816. The people of Sicily rebelled to this violation of its centuries-old statutes (which every king, including Ferdinand, had sworn to respect) but were defeated by the Neapolitan and [[House of Habsburg|Austrian]] forces in 1820. In 1848-49 another [[Sicilian revolution of independence of 1848|Sicilian revolution of independence]] occurred, which was put down by the new king [[Ferdinand II of the Two Sicilies|Ferdinand&amp;nbsp;II of the Two Sicilies]], who was nicknamed ''Re Bomba'' after his 5-day bombardment of Messina. The increased hostility of the peoples and the elites of Sicily towards Naples and the Bourbon dynasty created a very unstable equilibrium, kept under control only by an increasingly oppressive police-state, political executions and exiles.

===The Tunisian-Sicilian War===
The '''Tunisian-Sicilian War''' occurred between June 1801 and April 1804, when Tunisian pirates with Tunisian and Algerian military support attacked and captured several Sicilian ships.&lt;ref&gt;http://daddezio.com/italy/barbary/history.html&lt;/ref&gt; The main purpose of their attacks was to capture [[Christian]]-European [[slavery|slaves]] for the [[Muslim]]-[[Arab slave trade|Arab slave market]] in North Africa.&lt;ref&gt;Davis, Robert.

=== Unification with the Kingdom of Italy ===
[[File:Partenza da Quarto.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Giuseppe Garibaldi, while leaving from Quarto with his soldiers|The beginning of the Expedition of the Thousand at Quarto.]]
On April 4, 1860 the latest revolt against the [[House of Bourbon|Bourbon]] regime broke out. [[Giuseppe Garibaldi]], funded and directed by the Piedmontese prime minister Cavour, assisted the revolt with his forces, launching the so-called [[Expedition of the Thousand]]. He arrived at [[Marsala]] on May 11, 1860 with ca. 1,000 [[Redshirts (Italy)|Redshirts]]. Garibaldi announced that he was assuming [[dictatorship of Garibaldi|dictatorship over Sicily]] in the name of King [[Victor Emmanuel II of Italy|Victor Emmanuel II]] of Sardinia. On May 15, the Redshirts fought the [[Battle of Calatafimi]] and within weeks Palermo was freed from the troops of general Lanza, who even being superior in number, inexplicably retreated. [[Francis II of the Two Sicilies|Francis&amp;nbsp;II of the Two Sicilies]] tried to regain control of the Kingdom. On June 25, 1860 he restored the constitution of the Kingdom, adopted the Italian [[Flag of Italy|tricolour]] as the national flag, and promised special institutions for the Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=Alfonso Scirocco |title=Garibaldi: citizen of the world |year=2007 |page=279 |publisher=[[Princeton University Press]] |isbn=0-691-11540-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 21, 1860 a plebiscite regarding the unification with Italy was conducted. The outcome of the referendum was 432,053 (99%) in favour and only 667 in opposition to the unification. With three separate armies still fighting within the Kingdom, this outcome was far from an accurate depiction of public opinion. Substantial inconsistencies as well as the absence of secret ballot further complicate the interpretation of the referendum, which Dennis Mack Smith describes as being "obviously rigged".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=axgfeXGFvF8C&amp;lpg=PA17&amp;dq=plebiscite%25201860%2520sicily%2520mack%2520smith&amp;pg=PA17#v=onepage&amp;q=obviously%2520rigged&amp;f=false|title=Italy and Its Monarchy|last=Smith|first=Denis Mack|date=1992-03-01|publisher=[[Yale University Press]]|year=|isbn=0300051328|location=|pages=17|language=en|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NaxmTwps_S8C&amp;lpg=PA377&amp;ots=mEt9l0utsT&amp;dq=sicily%2520plebiscite%25201860&amp;pg=PA389#v=onepage&amp;q=sicily%2520plebiscite%25201860&amp;f=false|title=Cavour and Garibaldi 1860: A Study in Political Conflict|last=Smith|first=Denis Mack|date=1985-04-18|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=|isbn=9780521316378|location=|pages=389|language=en|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VmVHwYA4RBYC&amp;lpg=PA14&amp;ots=iW9GhH6ftf&amp;dq=sicily%2520plebiscite%25201860%2520fraud&amp;pg=PA14#v=onepage&amp;q=sicily%2520plebiscite%25201860%2520fraud&amp;f=false|title=Separatism, the Allies and the Mafia: The Struggle for Sicilian Independence, 1943-1948|last=Finkelstein|first=Monte S.|date=1998-01-01|publisher=[[Lehigh University Press]]|year=|isbn=9780934223515|location=|pages=14|language=en|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=U0-qglRPSAQC&amp;lpg=PA155&amp;ots=FEfS9YNgYr&amp;dq=sicily%2520plebiscite%25201860%2520fraud&amp;pg=PA155#v=onepage&amp;q=sicily%2520plebiscite%25201860%2520fraud&amp;f=false|title=Mafia &amp; Mafiosi: Origin, Power and Myth|last=Hess|first=Henner|date=1998-01-01|publisher=NYU Press|year=|isbn=9781863331432|location=|pages=155|language=en|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EFpy8TFB5lsC&amp;lpg=PA116&amp;dq=plebiscite%25201860%2520sicily%2520fraud&amp;pg=PA116#v=onepage&amp;q=plebiscite%25201860%2520sicily%2520fraud&amp;f=false|title=Historical Consciousness: The Remembered Past|last=Lukacs|first=John|date=1968-01-01|publisher=Transaction Publishers|year=|isbn=9781412825146|location=|pages=116|language=en|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=S4pJoHKt6BUC&amp;lpg=PA102&amp;dq=plebiscite%25201860%2520sicily%2520fraud&amp;pg=PA102#v=onepage&amp;q=plebiscite%25201860%2520sicily%2520fraud&amp;f=false|title=Structuring the State: The Formation of Italy and Germany and the Puzzle of Federalism|last=Ziblatt|first=Daniel|date=2006-01-01|publisher=[[Princeton University Press]]|year=|isbn=0691121672|location=|pages=102|language=en|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Western civilization|last=Noble|first=Thomas F.

During the Norman Kingdom of Sicily, the local communities maintained their privileges. The rulers of the Hohenstaufen Kingdom replaced the local nobility with lords from northern Italy, leading to clashes and rebellions against the new nobility in many cities and rural communities. These revolts resulted in the destruction of many agrarian areas and the rise of middle class nationalism, which eventually led to urban dwellers becoming allies of the [[Crown of Aragon|Aragonese]].&lt;ref name="hoh"/&gt; This situation was continued during the short rule of the Angevin until their overthrowing during the Sicilian Vespers. The Angevin began feudalising the country, increasing the power of the nobility by granting them jurisdiction over high justice.&lt;ref name="samkel"&gt;{{Cite book|author=Samantha Kelly |title=The new Solomon: Robert of Naples (1309–1343) and fourteenth-century kingship |year=2003 |page=134 |publisher=BRILL |isbn=90-04-12945-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;  During the 15th century due to the isolation of the Kingdom, the Renaissance had no impact on it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation needed|date=July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the same period the feudalisation of the Kingdom of Sicily was intensified, through the enforcement of feudal bonds and relations among its subjects. In 1669 the eruption of [[Mount Etna]] destroyed [[Catania]]. In 1693, 5% of the Kingdom's population was killed because of [[1693 Sicily earthquake|earthquakes]]. In that period there were also plague outbreaks. The 17th and 18th century were an era of decline of the Kingdom. Corruption was prevalent among the upper and middle classes of the society. Widespread corruption and maltreatment of the lower classes by the feudal lords led to the creation of groups of brigands, attacking the nobility and destroying their [[fief]]s.&lt;ref name="fromr"/&gt; These groups which were self-named "Mafia", were the foundation of the modern [[Sicilian Mafia]]. The escalation of revolts against the monarchy eventually led to the unification with Italy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=Lucy Riall |title=Sicily and the unification of Italy: liberal policy and local power, 1859–1866 |year=1998 |page=206 |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |isbn= 0-19-820680-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The high fertility of the land led the Norman kings to bring settlers from neighbouring regions or to resettle farmers to areas where cultivation of land was needed. This led to increase of agrarian production. The main sources of wealth for the Kingdom of Sicily at that period were its maritime cities, most important of which were [[Naples]] and [[Amalfi]], from which local products were exported. The main export was hard [[grain]], with other products exported including [[nut (fruit)|nut]]s, [[timber]], [[oil]], bacon, [[cheese]], skins, [[hide (skin)|hide]]s, [[hemp]] and [[cloth]].&lt;ref name="nrki"/&gt; Grain and other dry products were measured in salme, which was equivalent to 275.08&amp;nbsp;litres in the western part of the Kingdom, and 3.3&amp;nbsp;litres in the eastern part. The salma was divided in 16&amp;nbsp;tumoli. One tumolo was equivalent to 17,193&amp;nbsp;[[litre]]s. Weight was measured in cantari. One cantaro was equivalent to {{convert|79.35|kg}} and was divided in one hundred rottoli. Cloth was measured in canne. One canna was 2.06&amp;nbsp;meters long.&lt;ref name="jws"/&gt; By the end of the 12th century [[Messina]] had become one of the leading commercial cities of the kingdom.

Under the Kingdom, Sicily's products went to many different lands. Among these were [[Republic of Genoa|Genoa]], [[Republic of Pisa|Pisa]], the [[Byzantine Empire]], and [[Arab Republic of Egypt|Egypt]]. Over the course of the 12th century, Sicily became an important source of raw materials for north Italian cities such as Genoa. As the centuries went on, however, this economic relationship became less advantageous to Sicily, and some modern scholars see the relationship as frankly exploitative.&lt;ref&gt;Henri Bresc (in ''Un monde mediteranéen'') claims that Sicily was reduced to an agricultural hinterland for wealthier northern Italian cities, and sees the Sicilian people as an early proletariat&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, many scholars believe that Sicily went into decline in the late Middle Ages, though they are not agreed on when this decline occurred. Clifford Backman argues that it is a mistake to see the economic history of Sicily in terms of victimization, and contends that the decline really began in the second part of the reign of Frederick III, in contrast to earlier scholars who believed that Sicilian decline had set in earlier.&lt;ref&gt;Backman, ''The Decline and Fall of Medieval Sicily,'' 1995.&lt;/ref&gt; Where earlier scholars saw late medieval Sicily in continuous decline, Stephen Epstein argued that Sicilian society experienced something of a revival in the 15th century.&lt;ref&gt;Epstein, ''An Island for Itself: Economic Development and Social Change in Late Medieval Sicily,'' (2003).&lt;/ref&gt;

Various treaties with Genoa secured and strengthened the commercial power of Sicily.&lt;ref name="nrki"/&gt;

The feudalising of the society during the Angevin rule reduced royal wealth and treasury. The dependence of the Angevin on north Italian commerce and financing by [[Florence|Florentine]] bankers were the main factors which led to the decline of the Kingdom's economy.&lt;ref name="samkel"/&gt; The continuation of the economic decline combined with the increased population and [[urbanization]] led to decrease of agrarian production.

In 1800 one-third of the available crops was cultivated with obsolete cultivation methods escalating the problem. In the later period of Spanish rule the trading system was also inefficient in comparison with previous periods because of high taxes on exports and monopolising corporations which had total control of prices.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=Desmond Gregory |title=Sicily: the insecure base: a history of the British occupation of Sicily, 1806–1815 |year=1988 |page=35 |publisher=Fairleigh Dickinson Univ Press |isbn=0-8386-3306-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Coinage ==
[[File:Augustale.jpg|thumb|right|alt=A gold coin, which depicts the bust of a man and an eagle|Example of a Messinese augustale.]]
The Norman kings in the 12th century used the [[tarì|tari]], which had been used in Sicily from 913 as the basic coin. One tari weighed about one gram and was {{frac|16|1|3}} carats of gold. The [[Arab]] [[dinar]] was worth four tari, and the [[Byzantine]] [[Solidus (coin)|solidus]] six tari.&lt;ref name="nrki"/&gt; In the kingdom one onza was equivalent to thirty tari or five florins. One tari was worth twenty grani. One grana was equivalent to six denari. After 1140 the circulation of the copper coin romesina stopped and it was replaced by the follaris. Twenty four follari were equivalent to one Byzantine [[miliaresion]].

After defeating the [[History of medieval Tunisia|Tunisians]] in 1231 [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor]] minted the [[augustalis]]. It was minted in {{frac|21|1|2}} carats and weighed 5.28&amp;nbsp;grams.&lt;ref name="pogo"&gt;{{Cite book|author=Peter L. Bernstein |title=The power of gold: the history of an obsession |year=2000 |page=90 |publisher=John Wiley and Sons |isbn=0-471-25210-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1490 the triumphi were minted in Sicily. They were equivalent to the [[Republic of Venice|Venetian]] [[ducat]]. One triumpho was worth {{frac|11|1|2}} aquilae. One aquila was worth twenty grani. In transactions tari and pichuli were mainly used.&lt;ref name="jws"/&gt;

== Religion ==
During the Norman reign, several different religious communities coexisted in the Kingdom of Sicily. They were: Latin Christians ([[Roman Catholicism|Roman Catholics]]), Greek-speaking Christians ([[Eastern Orthodoxy|Eastern Orthodox]]), [[Islam|Muslims]] and [[Judaism|Jews]]. Although local religious practices were not interrupted, the fact that Latin Christians were in power tended to favor Latin Christianity (Roman Catholicism). Bishops of the Eastern Orthodox rite were obliged to recognize the claims of the Latin Church in Sicily, while Muslim communities were no longer ruled by local [[emir]]s. Greek-speaking Christians, Latin Christians, and Muslims interacted on a regular basis, and were involved in each other's lives, economically, linguistically, and culturally. Some intermarried. Christians living in an Arabic-speaking area might adopt Arabic or even Muslim names.&lt;ref&gt;Metcalfe, Alex. ''Muslims and Christians in Norman Sicily. Arabic Speakers and the End of Islam'', (2003).&lt;/ref&gt; In many cities, each religious community had its own administrative and judicial order. In [[Palermo]], Muslims were allowed to publicly call for prayer in mosques, and their legal issues were settled by [[qadi]]s, judges who ruled in accordance with Islamic law.&lt;ref name="nrki"/&gt;

After the establishment of Hohenstaufen authority Latin- and Greek-speaking Christians maintained their privileges, but the Muslim population was increasingly oppressed. The settlements of Italians brought from northern Italy (who wanted Muslim property for their own) led many Muslim communities to revolt or resettle in mountainous areas of Sicily.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; These revolts resulted in some acts of violence, and the eventual deportation of Muslims, which began under [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick II]]. Eventually, the government removed the entire Muslim population to [[Lucera]] in [[Apulia]] and [[Girifalco]] in [[Calabria]], where they paid taxes and served as agricultural laborers, craftsmen, and crossbowmen for the benefit of the king. The colony at Lucera was finally disbanded in 1300 under [[Charles II of Naples]], and many of its inhabitants sold into slavery.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;The best discussion of the fate of Sicilian Muslims can be found in Julie Taylor, ''Muslims in Medieval Italy: The Colony at Lucera'' (2003), but is also discussed in Alex Metcalfe, ''The Muslims of Medieval Italy'' (2009).&lt;/ref&gt; The Jewish community was [[Expulsion of the Jews from Sicily|expelled]] after the establishment of the Spanish Inquisition from 1493 to 1513 in Sicily. The remaining Jews were gradually assimilated, and most of them converted to Roman Catholicism.&lt;ref name="jws"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="98604">This is a list of flags of states, territories, and other entities sorted by their combinations of dominant colors. Flags emblazoned with seals, coats of arms, and other multicolored emblems are sorted only by their color fields. The color of text is similarly ignored.

Colors related to the two [[Tincture (heraldry)#Metals|metals]] of European [[heraldry]] (gold and white) are sorted first. The five major [[Tincture (heraldry)#Colours|"stains"]] of European heraldry (black, red, blue, green, and purple) are sorted next. Miscellaneous colors ([[murrey]], tan, grey, and pink) are sorted last.

Similar colors are grouped together to make navigation of this list practical. As such, the dark greens prevalent in the Middle East are sorted together with the brighter greens prevalent in Western Europe. Significantly: yellows, golds, and oranges are grouped together as "gold" due to the lack of discrete divisions within this spectrum and the differing standards of interpretation of "gold", which appears in the legally codified specifications of many flags. Some flags, including a number from [[South Asia]], include both a distinct yellow and a distinct orange; these have been noted accordingly.

{{for|the song by the Beatles|Little Child}}
'''"Little Child"''' was the [[Malta|Maltese]] entry in the [[Eurovision Song Contest 1992]], performed in [[English language|English]] by [[Mary Spiteri]].

The song is a ballad, in which Spiteri addresses the titular "little child" and informs him or her that she has become old and cynical - as well as delivering the warning that this is the result of growing older. All is not lost, however, as the innocence of the child inspires Spiteri to see the world in a more positive manner.

The song was performed tenth on the night (following [[Cyprus]]' [[Evridiki]] with "[[Teriazume]]" and preceding [[Iceland]]'s [[Heart 2 Heart (band)|Heart 2 Heart]] with "[[Nei Eða Já]]"). At the close of voting, it had received 123 points, placing 3rd in a field of 23—and thus bettering Malta's previous best result set in [[Eurovision Song Contest 1991|1991]] by a duo featuring [[Georgina Abela]], who composed this entry.

A [[Maltese language]] version was also recorded, titled '''"Tfajjel Ċkejken"'''.

It was succeeded as [[Malta in the Eurovision Song Contest|Maltese representative]] at the [[Eurovision Song Contest 1993|1993 Contest]] by [[William Mangion]] with "[[This Time (Eurovision song)|This Time]]".

'''Luvale''' (also spelt Chiluvale, Lovale, Lubale, Luena, Lwena) is a [[Bantu languages|Bantu language]] spoken by the [[Lovale people]] of [[Angola]] and [[Zambia]]. It is recognised as a regional language for educational and administrative purposes in Zambia, where about 168,000 (2006) people speak it.

Luvale is closely related to [[Chokwe language|Chokwe]].

==In fiction==

In the Swedish 1997 [[murder mystery]] novel "[[Faceless Killers]]", Inspector [[Kurt Wallander]] investigates a murderous racist attack on a refugee center in [[Skane]] and finds it difficult to communicate with a witness who speaks only the Luvale language. The problem is resolved when a 90-year-old woman is found, who is a former missionary who speaks Luvale fluently, and she acts as the interpreter.

'''Serbian Pomorje''' ({{lang-sr|Српско поморје}} / ''Srpsko pomorje'') or '''Serbian Primorje''' ({{lang-sr|Српско приморје}} / ''Srpsko primorje'') is a term (&lt;small&gt;[[Transliteration|literary meaning]]:&lt;/small&gt; ''maritime, littoral or coastland'') used in historical contexts to designate one of the two main geographical regions of [[Serbia in the Middle Ages|Medieval Serbia]]. The region included several territories of [[Upper Dalmatia]] and its hinterland, belonging to the present-day [[Montenegro]], [[Bosnia &amp; Herzegovina]], [[Croatia]] and [[Serbia]].{{sfn|Јанковић|2007|p=}}{{sfn|Janković|2007|p=}}

==History==
At the beginning of the 9th century, according to 822 entry of [[Einhard]]'s ''[[Royal Frankish Annals]]'', Serbs were ruling over "the greater part of [[Dalmatia (Roman province)|Dalmatia]]"{{sfn|Scholz|1970|p=111}} (''ad Sorabos, quae natio magnam Dalmatiae partem obtinere dicitur'').{{sfn|Pertz|1845|p=83}} The state of Serbian maritime regions in the Early Middle Ages was described in the ''[[De Administrando Imperio]]'',{{sfn|Moravcsik|1967|p=}} a work by [[Byzantine Emperor]] [[Constantine VII]] (l. 905-959) dedicated to his son, [[Romanus II]], as a domestic and foreign policy manual, referring to:

* [[Duklja]]
* [[Travunia]]
* [[Zahumlje]]
* [[Pagania]]

Serbian Pomorje included most of modern [[Montenegro]], the southern halves of [[Herzegovina]] and [[Dalmatia]], while the other geographical division, the ''[[Zagorje (Serbia)|Zagorje]]'' (&lt;small&gt;[[Transliteration|literary meaning]]:&lt;/small&gt; ''land behind the hills'') included most of modern [[Bosnia (region)|Bosnia]], the western half of the modern Serbia ([[Raška (region)|Raška]]), and the northern portions of Montenegro and Herzegovina.&lt;ref name=Forbes59&gt;Nevill Forbes, ''The Balkans: A History of Bulgaria, Serbia, Greece, Rumania, Turkey'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=qDduhCXNhi0C&amp;pg=PA59 p. 59], Digital Antiquaria, 2004, {{ISBN|1-58057-314-2}}, {{ISBN|978-1-58057-314-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Croatia lay to the north of Pomorje and Zagorje, covering all the country between the Pomorje and [[Sava (river)|Sava]].&lt;ref name=Forbes59/&gt;

==Use in royal titles==
The term was used in royal and religious titles; Serbian monarchs and their heirs (Uroš I, styled himself "King in Christ, God faithful, King of Serbia and Maritime Lands", and Patriarchs ([[Saint Sava III]], "Archbishop of All Serbian and Maritime Lands").

* [[Desa Urošević|Desa]], styled himself "Prince of Pomorje (Maritime Lands)"
* [[Stephen Vladislav I of Serbia|Vladislav]], styled himself "King of all the Serbian and Maritime Lands"
* [[Stephen Uroš I of Serbia|Uroš I]], styled himself "King in Christ, God faithful, King of Serbia and Maritime Lands"
* [[Stephen Uroš IV Dušan of Serbia|Uroš IV Dušan]], "King of all the Serbian and Maritime Lands"
* In 1377 [[Tvrtko I]] crowned himself King of "Serbia, Bosnia, Pomorje, and the Western lands."

[[File:Sahel Map-Africa rough.png|thumb|right|300px|The Sahel forms a belt up to 1,000 km wide, spanning Africa from the [[Atlantic Ocean]] to the [[Red Sea]].]]
The '''Sahelian kingdoms''' were a series of kingdoms or [[African empires|empires]] that were centered on the [[Sahel]], the area of grasslands south of the [[Sahara]].  The wealth of the states came from controlling the trade routes across the desert.  Their power came from having large [[pack animal]]s like [[camel]]s and [[horse]]s that were fast enough to keep a large empire under central control and were also useful in such kind of battle. All of these empires were also quite decentralized with member cities having a great deal of autonomy.

The Sahel states were limited from expanding south into the [[forest zone]] of the [[Ashanti people|Ashanti]] and [[Yoruba people|Yoruba]] as mounted warriors were all but useless in the forests and the horses and camels could not survive the heat and diseases of the region.

There were integrated kingdoms and empires, with substantial cities and significant towns; and less organised territories with large scattered populations. People practised agriculture, stock-rearing, hunting, fishing, and crafts (metalworking, textiles, ceramics). They navigated along rivers and across lakes, trading over short and long distances, using their own currencies.

==History of Sahel kingdoms==
*The first major state to rise in this region was the [[Kingdom of Ghana]]. Established in c. the 8th century, it was centered in what is today [[Senegal]] and [[Mauritania]], it was the first to benefit from the introduction of pack animals by [[Wolof people|Wolof]] traders.  Ghana dominated the region between about 750 and 1078.  Smaller states in the region at this time included [[Takrur]] to the west, the [[Malinke]] kingdom of Mali to the south, and the Songhai centred on [[Gao]] to the east.
*When Ghana collapsed in the face of invasion from the [[Almoravids]], a series of brief kingdoms followed, notably that of the [[Sosso]]; after 1235, the [[Mali Empire]] rose to dominate the region.  Located on the [[Niger River]] to the west of Ghana in what is today [[Niger]] and [[Mali]], it reached its peak in the 1350s, but had lost control of a number of vassal states by 1400.
*The most powerful of these states was the [[Songhai Empire]], which expanded rapidly beginning with king [[Sonni Ali]] in the 1460s. By 1500, it had risen to stretch from [[Cameroon]] to the [[Maghreb]], the largest state in African history.  It too was quite short-lived and collapsed in 1591 as a result of [[Morocco|Moroccan]] [[musket]]ry.
*Far to the east, on [[Lake Chad]], the state of [[Bornu Empire|Kanem-Bornu]], founded as Kanem in the 9th century, now rose to greater preeminence in the central Sahel region. To their west, the loosely united [[Hausa Kingdoms|Hausa city-states]] became dominant.  These two states coexisted uneasily, but were quite stable.
*In 1810 the [[Fulani Empire]] rose and conquered the Hausa, creating a more centralized state.  It and Kanem-Bornu would continue to exist.

Slovakia's territory spans about {{convert|49000|km2|sqmi}} and is mostly mountainous. The population is over 5.4 million and consists mostly of [[Slovaks]]. The capital and largest city is [[Bratislava]], and the second largest city is [[Košice]]. The [[official language]] is [[Slovak language|Slovak]].

The [[Slavs]] arrived in the territory of present-day Slovakia in the 5th and 6th centuries. In the 7th century, they played a significant role in the creation of [[Samo's Empire]] and in the 9th century established the [[Principality of Nitra]], which was later conquered by the [[Principality of Moravia]] to establish [[Great Moravia]]. In the 10th century, after the dissolution of [[Great Moravia]], the territory was integrated into the [[Principality of Hungary]], which would become the [[Kingdom of Hungary]] in [[1000]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Encyclopedia of Russian &amp; Slavic myth and legend|last=Dixon-Kennedy|first=Mike|year=1998|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=978-1-57607-130-4|page=375|url=https://books.google.com/?id=eD5AkdM83iIC&amp;pg=PA57 |accessdate=23 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;. In 1241 and 1242, much of the territory was destroyed by the [[Mongols]] during their [[Mongol invasion of Europe|invasion of Central and Eastern Europe]]. The area was recovered largely thanks to [[Béla IV of Hungary]] who also settled [[Zipser Germans|Germans]] which became an important ethnic group in the area, especially in what are today parts of [[Hauerland|central]] and eastern Slovakia. After [[World War I]] and the dissolution of the [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]], the Czechoslovak National Council established [[Czechoslovakia]] (1918–1939). A separate (First) [[Slovak Republic (1939–45)|Slovak Republic (1939–1945)]] existed during [[World War II]] as a [[Totalitarianism|totalitarian]], [[Clerical fascism|clero-fascist]] [[One-party state|one-party]] [[client state]] of [[Nazi Germany]]. At the end of World War II, Czechoslovakia was re-established as an independent country. A [[1948 Czechoslovak coup d'état|coup in 1948]] ushered in a totalitarian one-party state under the [[History of Czechoslovakia (1948–89)|Communist regime]] during whose rule the country existed as a [[Satellite state|satellite]] of the [[Soviet Union]]. Attempts for [[Socialism with a human face|liberalization of communism]] in Czechoslovakia culminated in the [[Prague Spring]], which was crushed by the [[Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia]] in August 1968. In 1989, the [[Velvet Revolution]] ended the Communist rule in Czechoslovakia peacefully. Slovakia became an independent state on 1 January 1993 after the peaceful [[dissolution of Czechoslovakia]], sometimes known as the [[Dissolution of Czechoslovakia|Velvet Divorce]].

== History ==
{{Main|History of Slovakia}}
[[File:Moravianska venusa.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.9|A [[Moravany Venus|Venus]] from [[Moravany nad Váhom]], which dates back to 22,800 BC]]
[[Radiocarbon dating]] puts the oldest surviving archaeological artefacts from Slovakia – found near [[Nové Mesto nad Váhom]] – at 270,000&amp;nbsp;BCE, in the [[Lower Paleolithic|Early Paleolithic]] era. These ancient tools, made by the [[Clactonian]] technique, bear witness to the ancient habitation of Slovakia.

Other [[stone tool]]s from the [[Middle Paleolithic]] era (200,000 – 80,000&amp;nbsp;BCE) come from the Prévôt (Prepoštská) cave near [[Bojnice]] and from other nearby sites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://muzeumpraveku.sk/ |title=Museum of Prehistoric |last=Museum of Prehistoric Prepoštská Cave|work=muzeumpraveku.sk |year=2011 |accessdate=25 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most important discovery from that era is a [[Neanderthal]] [[human skull|cranium]] (c. 200,000 BCE), discovered near [[Gánovce]], a village in northern Slovakia.

Archaeologists have found prehistoric human skeletons in the region, as well as numerous objects and vestiges of the [[Gravettian]] culture, principally in the river valleys of [[Nitra (river)|Nitra]], [[Hron]], [[Ipeľ]], [[Váh]] and as far as the city of [[Žilina]], and near the foot of the [[Vihorlat Mountains|Vihorlat]], Inovec, and [[Tribeč]] mountains, as well as in the [[Myjava]] Mountains. The most well-known finds include the oldest female statue made of [[mammoth]]-bone (22,800&amp;nbsp;BCE), the famous [[Venus of Moravany]]. The statue was found in the 1940s in [[Moravany nad Váhom]] near [[Piešťany]]. Numerous necklaces made of shells from Cypraca thermophile [[gastropoda|gastropods]] of the [[Tertiary]] period have come from the sites of Zákovská, Podkovice, Hubina, and Radošina. These findings provide the most ancient evidence of commercial exchanges carried out between the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]] and central Europe.

=== Bronze Age ===
[[File:Web Biatec.jpg|thumb|Left: a [[Celts|Celtic]] [[Biatec]] coin&lt;br /&gt;Right: five [[Slovak koruna|Slovak crowns]]]]
The [[Bronze Age]] in the geographical territory of modern-day Slovakia went through three stages of development, stretching from 2000 to 800&amp;nbsp;BCE. &lt;!--I am not sure what the following sentences mean, so I put them into this comment: To this there period belongs the well-known funeral culture of the Carpathians and that of the middle [[Danube]]. During the later Neolithic Age a considerable growth in cultural regions took place in Slovakia.--&gt; Major cultural, economic, and political development can be attributed to the significant growth in production of copper, especially in central Slovakia (for example in [[Špania Dolina]]) and northwest Slovakia. Copper became a stable source of prosperity for the local population.

After the disappearance of the Čakany and [[Velatice]] cultures, the [[Lusatian culture|Lusatian]] people expanded building of strong and complex fortifications, with the large permanent buildings and administrative centres. Excavations of Lusatian [[Hillfort|hill forts]] document the substantial development of trade and agriculture at that period. The richness and the diversity of tombs increased considerably. The inhabitants of the area manufactured arms, shields, jewellery, dishes, and statues.

=== Iron Age ===

==== Hallstatt Period ====
The arrival of tribes from [[Thrace]] disrupted the people of the [[Kalenderberg culture]], who lived in the hamlets located on the plain ([[Sereď]]) and in the hill forts like Molpír, near [[Smolenice]], in the [[Little Carpathians]]. During Hallstatt times, monumental burial mounds were erected in western Slovakia, with princely equipment consisting of richly decorated vessels, ornaments and decorations. The burial rites consisted entirely of cremation. The common people were buried in flat urnfield cemeteries. A special role was given to weaving and the production of textiles. The local power of the "Princes" of the [[Hallstatt culture|Hallstatt period]] disappeared in Slovakia during the last century before the middle of first millennium BCE, after strife between the [[Scythians|Scytho]]-Thracian people and locals, resulting in abandonment of the old hill-forts. Relatively depopulated areas soon caught interest of emerging [[Celts|Celtic]] tribes, who advanced from the south towards the north, following the Slovak rivers, peacefully integrating into the remnants of the local population.

==== La Tène Period ====
From around 500&amp;nbsp;BCE, the territory of modern-day Slovakia was settled by [[Celt]]s, who built powerful ''[[oppida]]'' on the sites of modern-day [[Bratislava]] and [[Devín]]. [[Biatec]]s, [[silver coin]]s with inscriptions in the Latin alphabet, represent the first known use of writing in Slovakia. At the northern regions, remnants of the local population of Lusatian origin, together with Celtic and later Dacian influence, gave rise to the unique [[Púchov culture]], with advanced crafts and iron-working, many hill-forts and fortified settlements of central type with coinage of the "Velkobysterecky" type (no inscriptions, with a horse on one side and a head on the other). This culture is often connected with the Celtic tribe mentioned in Roman sources as [[Cotini]].

==== Roman Period ====
[[File:Trencin-Roman2.JPG|thumb|A Roman inscription at the castle hill of [[Trenčín]] (178–179 AD)]]
From 2&amp;nbsp;[[Common Era|CE]], the expanding [[Roman Empire]] established and maintained a series of outposts around and just north of the [[Danube]], the largest of which were known as [[Carnuntum]] (whose remains are on the main road halfway between Vienna and Bratislava) and [[Brigetio]] (present-day [[Szőny]] at the Slovak-Hungarian border). Such Roman border settlements were built on the present area of [[Rusovce]], currently a suburb of Bratislava. The military fort was surrounded by a civilian [[vicus]] and several farms of the [[villa rustica]] type. The name of this settlement was [[Gerulata]]. The military fort had an auxiliary cavalry unit, approximately 300 horses strong, modelled after the [[Cananefates]]. The remains of Roman buildings have also survived in [[Devín Castle]] (present-day downtown Bratislava), the suburbs of Dúbravka and Stupava, and Bratislava Castle Hill.

Near the northernmost line of the Roman hinterlands, the [[Limes Romanus]], there existed the winter camp of [[Trenčín|Laugaricio]] (modern-day [[Trenčín]]) where the Auxiliary of Legion&amp;nbsp;II fought and prevailed in a decisive battle over the Germanic [[Quadi]] tribe in 179&amp;nbsp;CE during the [[Marcomannic Wars]]. The Kingdom of [[Vannius]], a kingdom founded by the [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] [[Suebi]]an tribes of [[Quadi]] and [[Marcomanni]], as well as several small Germanic and [[List of Celtic tribes|Celtic tribes]], including the Osi and [[Cotini]], existed in western and central Slovakia from 8–6&amp;nbsp;BCE to 179&amp;nbsp;CE.

=== Great invasions from the 4th to 7th centuries ===
In the 2nd and 3rd centuries CE, the [[Huns]] began to leave the Central Asian steppes. They crossed the Danube in 377&amp;nbsp;CE and occupied [[Pannonia]], which they used for 75&amp;nbsp;years as their base for launching looting-raids into Western Europe. However, Attila's death in 453 brought about the disappearance of the Hun tribe. In 568, a Turko-Mongol tribal confederacy, the [[Pannonian Avars|Avars]], conducted its own invasion into the Middle Danube region. The Avars occupied the lowlands of the [[Pannonian Plain]], and established an empire dominating the [[Pannonian Basin|Carpathian Basin]].

In 623, the Slavic population living in the western parts of Pannonia seceded from their empire after a revolution led by Samo, a Frankish merchant.&lt;ref name="Történeti Kronológia"&gt;{{cite book|last=Benda|first=Kálmán|title=Magyarország történeti kronológiája ''("The Historical Chronology of Hungary")''|publisher=Akadémiai Kiadó|year=1981|location=Budapest|page=44|isbn=963-05-2661-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; After 626, the Avar power started a gradual decline&lt;ref&gt;Kristó, p.30–31&lt;/ref&gt; but its reign lasted to 804.

=== Slavic states ===
The [[Slavic peoples|Slavic]] tribes settled in the territory of present-day Slovakia in the 5th century. Western Slovakia was the centre of [[Samo]]'s empire in the 7th century. A Slavic state known as the [[Principality of Nitra]] arose in the 8th century and its ruler [[Pribina]] had the first known Christian church of the territory of present-day Slovakia consecrated by 828. Together with neighbouring [[Moravia]], the principality formed the core of the [[Great Moravia]]n Empire from 833. The high point of this Slavonic empire came with the arrival of [[Saints Cyril and Methodius]] in 863, during the reign of [[Duke]] [[Rastislav of Moravia|Rastislav]], and the territorial expansion under [[Duke]] [[Svätopluk I]].

=== Great Moravia (830–before 907) ===

Duke Rastislav asked the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine Emperor]] [[Michael III]] to send teachers who would interpret Christianity in the Slavic vernacular.

Upon Rastislav's request, two brothers, Byzantine officials and missionaries [[Saints Cyril and Methodius]] came in 863. Cyril developed the [[Glagolitic alphabet|first Slavic alphabet]] and translated the Gospel into the [[Old Church Slavonic]] language. Rastislav was also preoccupied with the security and administration of his state. Numerous fortified castles built throughout the country are dated to his reign and some of them (e.g.,&amp;nbsp;''Dowina'', sometimes identified with [[Devín Castle]])&lt;ref name="worldarcheology"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1080/00438243.1978.9979728|title=The Origins of Christianity in Slavonic Countries North of the Middle Danube Basin|journal=World Archaeology|year=1978|first=Josef|last=Poulik|volume=10|issue=2|pages=158–171|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="caplovic"&gt;{{cite book|last=Čaplovič|first=Dušan|author2=Viliam Čičaj |author3=Dušan Kováč |author4=Ľubomír Lipták |author5=Ján Lukačka |title=Dejiny Slovenska|publisher=AEP|year=2000|location=Bratislava}}&lt;/ref&gt; are also mentioned in connection with Rastislav by Frankish chronicles.&lt;ref&gt;pages=167, 566&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="fulda"&gt;{{cite book|title=Annales Fuldenses, sive, Annales regni Francorum orientalis ab Einhardo, Ruodolfo, Meginhardo Fuldensibus, Seligenstadi, Fuldae, Mogontiaci conscripti cum continuationibus Ratisbonensi et Altahensibus / post editionem G.&amp;nbsp;H.&amp;nbsp;Pertzii recognovit Friderious Kurze ; Accedunt Annales Fuldenses antiquissimi|publisher=Imprensis Bibliopolii Hahniani|year=1978|location=Hanover|url=http://www.medievalsources.co.uk/fulda.htm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070312020323/http://www.medievalsources.co.uk/fulda.htm|dead-url=yes|archive-date=12 March 2007|accessdate=26 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Letter svatopluk.jpg|thumb|upright= 0.8|alt=The papal letter "Industriae Tuae"|''Scire vos volumus'', a letter written in 879 by [[Pope John VIII]] to [[Svatopluk I]]]]

During Rastislav's reign, the [[Principality of Nitra]] was given to his nephew [[Svatopluk I of Moravia|Svätopluk]] as an [[appanage]].&lt;ref name="caplovic"/&gt; The rebellious prince allied himself with the Franks and overthrew his uncle in 870. Similarly to his predecessor, Svätopluk I (871–894) assumed the title of the king (''rex''). During his reign, the Great Moravian Empire reached its greatest territorial extent, when not only present-day [[Moravia]] and Slovakia but also present-day northern and [[central Hungary]], [[Lower Austria]], [[Bohemia]], [[Silesia]], [[Lusatia]], southern Poland and [[Vojvodina|northern Serbia]] belonged to the empire, but the exact borders of his domains are still disputed by modern authors.&lt;ref name="Tóth"&gt;{{cite book|last=Tóth|first=Sándor László|title=Levediától a Kárpát-medencéig ''("From Levedia to the Carpathian Basin")''|publisher=Szegedi Középkorász Műhely|year=1998|location=Szeged|page=199|isbn=963-482-175-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Svatopluk also withstood attacks of the [[Hungarians|Magyar]] tribes and the [[First Bulgarian Empire|Bulgarian Empire]], although sometimes it was he who hired the Magyars when waging war against East Francia.&lt;ref&gt;page=51&lt;/ref&gt;

In 880, [[Pope John&amp;nbsp;VIII]] set up an independent [[ecclesiastical province]] in Great Moravia with Archbishop [[Saints Cyril and Methodius|Methodius]] as its head. He also named the German cleric [[Wiching]] the Bishop of [[Nitra]].
[[File:Great Moravia Svatopluk.jpg|thumb|left|Certain and disputed borders of Great Moravia under [[Svatopluk I]] (according to modern historians)]]

After the death of Prince Svatopluk in 894, his sons [[Mojmir II of Moravia|Mojmír&amp;nbsp;II]] (894–906?) and [[Svatopluk&amp;nbsp;II]] succeeded him as the Prince of Great Moravia and the Prince of Nitra respectively.&lt;ref name="caplovic"/&gt; However, they started to quarrel for domination of the whole empire. Weakened by an internal conflict as well as by constant warfare with [[Eastern Francia]], Great Moravia lost most of its peripheral territories.

It is not known what happened with both Mojmír&amp;nbsp;II and Svatopluk&amp;nbsp;II because they are not mentioned in written sources after 906. In [[Battle of Pressburg|three battles]] (4–5 July and 9 August 907) near [[Bratislava]], the Magyars routed [[Bavaria]]n armies. Some historians put this year as the date of the break-up of the Great Moravian Empire, due to the Hungarian conquest; other historians take the date a little bit earlier (to 902).

Great Moravia left behind a lasting legacy in Central and Eastern Europe. The [[Glagolitic alphabet|Glagolitic script]] and its successor [[Cyrillic script|Cyrillic]] were disseminated to other Slavic countries, charting a new path in their [[Sociocultural evolution|sociocultural development]]. The administrative system of [[Great Moravia]] may have influenced the development of the administration of the [[Kingdom of Hungary]].

Following the disintegration of the [[Great Moravian Empire]] at the turn of the 10th century, the Hungarians annexed the territory comprising modern Slovakia. After their defeat on the [[Lech River]] they abandoned their nomadic ways; they settled in the centre of the Carpathian valley, adopted Christianity and began to build a new state – the Hungarian kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://loststory.net/node/71 |title=The kingdom of Hungary  |publisher=loststory.net|accessdate=15 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From the 11th century, when the territory inhabited by the Slavic-speaking population of Danubian Basin was incorporated into the Kingdom of Hungary, until 1918, when the [[Austro-Hungarian empire]] collapsed, the territory of modern Slovakia was an integral part of the Hungarian state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Felak, James Ramon |title=At the Price of the Republic: Hlinka’s Slovak People’s Party, 1929–1938|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sOlD_8Kw0K0C&amp;pg=PA3|date=15 June 1995|publisher=University of Pittsburgh Pre|isbn=978-0-8229-7694-3|pages=3–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Schuster, Rudolf |title=The Slovak Republic: A Decade of Independence, 1993–2002|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Brjcd07bN6sC&amp;pg=PA71|date=January 2004|publisher=Bolchazy-Carducci Publishers|isbn=978-0-86516-568-7|pages=71–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Prokhorov, A.

A significant decline in the population resulted from the [[Mongol invasion of Europe|invasion of the Mongols]] in 1241 and the subsequent famine.

Owing to the [[Ottoman Empire]]'s expansion into Hungarian territory, [[Bratislava]] was designated the new capital of Hungary in 1536, ahead of the old Hungarian capital of [[Buda]] falling in 1541. It become part of the Austrian Habsburg monarchy, marking the beginning of a new era. The territory comprising modern Slovakia, then known as [[Upper Hungary]], became the place of settlement for nearly two-thirds of the [[Magyar tribes|Magyar]] nobility fleeing the Turks and far more linguistically and culturally Hungarian than it was before.&lt;ref name="books.google.pl"/&gt; Partly thanks to old [[Hussite]] families, and Slovaks studying under [[Martin Luther]], the region then experienced a growth in [[Protestantism]].&lt;ref name="books.google.pl"/&gt; For a short period in the 17th century, most Slovaks were [[Lutherans]].&lt;ref name="books.google.pl"/&gt; They defied the Catholic Habsburgs and sought protection from neighboring [[Transylvania]], a rival continuation of the [[Magyar tribes|Magyar]] state that practiced religious tolerance and normally had Ottoman backing. Upper Hungary, modern Slovakia, became the site of frequent wars between Catholics in the west territory and Protestants in the east, also against Turks, the frontier was on a constant state of military alert and heavily fortified by castles and citadels often manned by Catholic German and Slovak troops on the Habsburg side. By 1648, Slovakia was not spared the [[Counter-Reformation]], which brought the majority of its population from Lutheranism back to [[Roman Catholicism]]. In 1655, the printing press at the [[Trnava]] university produced the Jesuit Benedikt Szöllősi's Cantus Catholici, a Catholic hymnal in the Slovak language that reaffirmed links to the earlier works of Cyril and Methodius.

The [[Ottoman wars in Europe|Ottoman wars]], rivalry between [[Austria]] and [[Transylvania]], and the frequent insurrections against the [[Habsburg Monarchy]] inflicted a great deal of devastation, especially in the rural areas.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.slovakiasite.com/history-hungary.php Part of Hungary, Turkish occupation]". Slovakiasite.com&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Austro-Turkish War (1663–1664)]] a Turkish army led by the [[Grand Vizier]] decimated Slovakia.&lt;ref name="books.google.pl"/&gt; Even so, Slovaks from the [[Principality of Upper Hungary]] fought alongside the Turks against the Austrians at the [[Battle of Vienna]] of 1683. As the [[Great Turkish War|Turks withdrew]] from Hungary in the late 17th century, the importance of the territory comprising modern Slovakia decreased, although [[Pressburg]] retained its status as the capital of Hungary until 1848, when it was transferred back to Buda.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.slovakiasite.com/bratislava.php Bratislava]. Slovakiasite.com&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Revolutions of 1848 in the Habsburg areas|revolution of 1848–49]], the Slovaks supported the [[Emperor of Austria|Austrian Emperor]], hoping for independence from the Hungarian part of the [[Austria–Hungary|Dual Monarchy]], but they failed to achieve their aim. Thereafter relations between the nationalities deteriorated (see [[Magyarization]]), culminating in the secession of Slovakia from Hungary after World War I.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Divided Memories: The Image of the First World War in the Historical Memory of Slovaks|publisher=Slovak Sociological Review, Issue 3 |year=2003|url=http://www.ceeol.com/aspx/issuedetails.aspx?issueid=d5aaf7a2-7ccf-4f83-9409-e74d93a37525&amp;articleId=283fe9e3-f8ed-463a-92cd-69ec0cb28b52|accessdate=25 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Czechoslovakia (1918–1939) ===
{{Main|Czechoslovakia}}
[[File:Masaryk a Štefánik.jpg|thumb|A monument to [[Tomáš Garrigue Masaryk]] and [[Milan Rastislav Štefánik|Milan Štefánik]] – both key figures in early Czechoslovakia]]
[[File:Prohlášení nezávislosti.jpg|thumb|right|[[Czechoslovak declaration of independence]] by [[Tomáš Garrigue Masaryk]] in the United States, 1918.]]
In 1918, Slovakia and the regions of [[Bohemia]], [[Moravia]], [[Czech Silesia]] and [[Carpathian Ruthenia]] formed a common state, [[Czechoslovakia]], with the borders confirmed by the [[Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (1919)|Treaty of Saint Germain]] and [[Treaty of Trianon]]. In 1919, during the chaos following the break-up of Austria-Hungary, Czechoslovakia was formed with numerous Germans and Hungarians within the newly set borders. A Slovak patriot [[Milan Rastislav Štefánik]] (1880–1919), who helped organise Czechoslovak regiments against Austria-Hungary during the First World War, died in a plane crash. In the peace following the World War, Czechoslovakia emerged as a sovereign European state. It provided what were at the time rather extensive rights to its minorities and remained the only democracy in this part of Europe in the interwar period.

During the [[Interwar period]], democratic Czechoslovakia was allied with France, and also with [[Romania]] and [[Yugoslavia]] ([[Little Entente]]); however, the [[Locarno Treaties]] of 1925 left East European security open. Both Czechs and Slovaks enjoyed a period of relative prosperity. There was progress in not only the development of the country's economy, but also culture and educational opportunities. The minority Germans came to accept their role in the new country and relations with Austria were good. Yet the [[Great Depression]] caused a sharp economic downturn, followed by political disruption and insecurity in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;J.&amp;nbsp;V.&amp;nbsp;Polisencky, ''History of Czechoslovakia in Outline'' (Prague: Bohemia International 1947) at 113–114.&lt;/ref&gt;

Thereafter Czechoslovakia came under continuous pressure from the [[Revanchism|revisionist]] governments of Germany and Hungary. Eventually this led to the [[Munich Agreement]] of September 1938, which allowed Nazi Germany to partially dismember the country by occupying what was called the [[Sudetenland]], a region with a German-speaking majority and bordering Germany and Austria. The remainder of "rump" Czechoslovakia was renamed [[Czecho-Slovakia]] and included a greater degree of Slovak political autonomy. Southern and eastern Slovakia, however, was reclaimed by Hungary at the [[First Vienna Award]] of November 1938.

=== World War II (1939–1945) ===

[[File:Jozef Tiso (Berlin).jpg|thumb|[[Adolf Hitler]] greeting [[Jozef Tiso]], 1941]]
After the [[Munich Agreement]] and its [[Vienna Award]], [[Nazi Germany]] threatened to annex part of Slovakia and allow the remaining regions to be partitioned by Hungary or Poland unless independence was declared. Thus, Slovakia seceded from Czecho-Slovakia in March 1939 and allied itself, as demanded by Germany, with [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler's]] coalition.&lt;ref&gt;Gerhard L. Weinberg, ''The Foreign Policy of Hitler's Germany: Starting World War II, 1937–1939'' (Chicago, 1980), pp. 470–481.&lt;/ref&gt; Secession had created the first Slovak state in history.&lt;ref name="RadioPrague"&gt;{{cite web|author=Dominik Jůn interviewing Professor Jan Rychlík|title=Czechs and Slovaks – more than just neighbours|publisher=Radio Prague|year=2016|url=http://www.radio.cz/en/section/special/czechs-and-slovaks-more-than-just-neighbours|accessdate=28 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The government of the [[Slovak Republic (1939–1945)|First Slovak Republic]], led by [[Jozef Tiso]] and [[Vojtech Tuka]], was strongly influenced by Germany and gradually became a [[puppet state|puppet regime]] in many respects.

Meanwhile, the [[Czechoslovak government-in-exile]] sought to reverse the [[Munich Agreement]] and the subsequent German occupation of Czechoslovakia, and to return the Republic to its 1937 boundaries. The government operated from [[London]] and it was ultimately considered, by those countries that recognised it, the legitimate government for Czechoslovakia throughout the Second World War.

After it became clear that the Soviet [[Red Army]] was going to push the Nazis out of eastern and central Europe, an anti-Nazi [[resistance movement]] launched a fierce armed insurrection, known as the [[Slovak National Uprising]], near the end of summer 1944. A bloody German occupation and a guerilla war followed. Germans and their [[Hlinka Guard|local collaborators]] completely destroyed 93 villages and massacred thousands of civilians, often hundreds at a time.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://travel.spectator.sme.sk/articles/80/slovenske_narodne_povstanie_the_slovak_national_uprising Slovenské Národné Povstanie – the Slovak national uprising]".

As a result of the [[Yalta Conference]], Czechoslovakia came under the influence and later under direct occupation of the Soviet Union and its [[Warsaw Pact]], after a coup in 1948 {{Citation needed|date=February 2018}}. The country was [[Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia|invaded]] by the Warsaw Pact forces (with the exception of [[Romania]] and [[Albania]]) in 1968, ending a [[Prague Spring|period of liberalisation]] under the leadership of [[Alexander Dubček]]. In 1969 Czechoslovakia became a federation of the [[Czech Socialist Republic]] and the [[Slovak Socialist Republic]]. Czechoslovakia was never part of the Soviet Union and remained independent to a degree.

=== Establishment of the Slovak Republic (after 1993) ===
[[File:Tratado de Lisboa 13 12 2007 (081).jpg|thumb|left|Slovakia became a member of the European Union in 2004 and signed the [[Lisbon Treaty]] in 2007.]]
The end of Communist rule in Czechoslovakia in 1989, during the peaceful [[Velvet Revolution]], was followed once again by the country's dissolution, this time into two [[succession of states|successor states]]. The word "socialist" was dropped in the names of the two republics, i.e. the Slovak Socialist Republic was renamed Slovak Republic. In July 17, 1992 Slovakia, led by Prime Minister [[Vladimír Mečiar]], declared itself a sovereign state, meaning that its laws took precedence over those of the federal government. Throughout the autumn of 1992, Mečiar and [[List of Prime Ministers of the Czech Republic|Czech Prime Minister]] [[Václav Klaus]] negotiated the details for disbanding the federation. In November the federal parliament voted to dissolve the country officially on December 31, 1992.

The Slovak Republic and the [[Czech Republic]] went their separate ways after 1 January 1993, an event sometimes called the [[Dissolution of Czechoslovakia|Velvet Divorce]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slovakia.org/history-topics |title=The Breakup of Czechoslovakia |publisher=Slovakia |accessdate=3 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/velvet+divorce |title=Velvet divorce |publisher=Dictionary.reference.com |accessdate=3 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Slovakia has remained a close partner with the Czech Republic. Both countries co-operate with Hungary and Poland in the [[Visegrád Group]]. Slovakia became a member of NATO on 29 March 2004 and of the European Union on 1 May 2004. On 1 January 2009, Slovakia adopted the [[Euro]] as its national currency.

Slovakia lies between latitudes [[47th parallel north|47°]] and [[50th parallel north|50° N]], and longitudes [[16th meridian east|16°]] and [[23rd meridian east|23° E]]. The Slovak landscape is noted primarily for its mountainous nature, with the [[Carpathian Mountains]] extending across most of the northern half of the country. Among these [[mountain range]]s are the high peaks of the [[Fatra-Tatra Area]] (including [[Tatra Mountains]], [[Veľká Fatra|Greater Fatra]] and [[Lesser Fatra]]), [[Slovak Ore Mountains]], [[Slovak Central Mountains]] or [[Beskids]].

The Tatra Mountains, with 29 peaks higher than {{convert|2500|m|ft|0|abbr=off}} [[Sea level#AMSL|AMSL]], are the highest mountain range in the Carpathian Mountains. The Tatras occupy an area of {{convert|750|km²|0|abbr=out}}, of which the greater part {{convert|600|km²|0|abbr=out}} lies in Slovakia. They are divided into several parts.

To the north, close to the Polish border, are the [[High Tatras]] which are a popular [[hiking]] and [[skiing]] destination and home to many scenic lakes and valleys as well as the highest point in Slovakia, the [[Gerlachovský štít]] at {{convert|2655|m|ft|0}} and the country's highly symbolic mountain [[Kriváň (peak)|Kriváň]]. To the west are the [[Western Tatras]] with their highest peak of [[Bystrá (mountain)|Bystrá]] at {{convert|2248|m|ft|0}} and to the east are the [[Belianske Tatras]], smallest by area.

Separated from the Tatras proper by the valley of the [[Váh]] river are the [[Low Tatras]], with their highest peak of [[Ďumbier]] at {{convert|2043|m|ft|0}}.

The Tatra mountain range is represented as one of the three hills on the [[coat of arms of Slovakia]].

Slovakia has hundreds of caves and caverns under its mountains, of which 30 are open to the public.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ssj.sk/sk/verejnosti-volne-pristupne-jaskyne|title=Verejnosti voľne prístupné jaskyne|publisher=ssj.sk |accessdate=19 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the caves have [[stalagmite]]s rising from the ground and [[stalactite]]s hanging from above. There are currently five Slovak caves under [[UNESCO]]'s World Heritage Site status. They are [[Dobšinská Ice Cave]], [[Domica]], [[Gombasek Cave]], [[Jasovská Cave]] and [[Ochtinská Aragonite Cave]].

The longest river in Slovakia is the [[Vah River|Váh]] ({{convert|403|km|mi|0}}), the shortest is the Čierna voda. Other important and large rivers are the [[Myjava (river)|Myjava]], the [[Nitra (river)|Nitra]] ({{convert|197|km|mi|0}}), the [[Orava (river)|Orava]], the [[Hron]] ({{convert|298|km|mi|0}}), the [[Hornád]] ({{convert|193|km|mi|0}}), the [[Sajó|Slaná]] ({{convert|110|km|mi|0}}), the [[Ipeľ]] ({{convert|232|km|mi|0}}, forming the border with Hungary), the [[Bodrog]], the [[Laborec]], the [[Latorica]] and the [[Ondava]].

The biggest volume of discharge in Slovak rivers is during [[Spring (season)|spring]], when the snow melts from the mountains. The only exception is the Danube, whose discharge is the greatest during summer when the snow melts in the [[Alps]]. The Danube is the largest river that flows through Slovakia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Nie ste prihlásený. |url=http://www.slovakregion.sk/vodstvo-jazera-rieky-rybniky-slovenska |title=Translated from Slovak language |publisher=Slovakregion.sk |accessdate=10 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Climate ===
[[File:Slovakia Köppen.svg|thumb|left|[[Köppen climate classification]] types of Slovakia]]

The Slovak climate lies between the temperate and [[continental climate]] zones with relatively warm summers and cold, cloudy and humid winters. Temperature extremes are between {{convert|-41|to|40.3|C|F|1}} although temperatures below {{convert|-30|°C|0}} are rare. The weather differs from the mountainous north to the plains in the south.

The warmest region is [[Bratislava]] and Southern Slovakia where the temperatures may reach {{convert|30|°C|0|abbr=on}} in summer, occasionally to {{convert|39|°C|0|abbr=on}} in [[Hurbanovo]]. During night, the temperatures drop to {{convert|20|°C|0|abbr=on}}. The daily temperatures in winter average in the range of {{convert|-5|°C|0|abbr=on}} to {{convert|10|°C|0|abbr=on}}. During night it may be freezing, but usually not below {{convert|-10|°C|0|abbr=on}}.

In Slovakia, there are [[Season|four seasons]], each season (Spring, Summer, Autumn and Winter) lasts three months. The dry continental air brings in the summer heat and winter frosts. In contrast, oceanic air brings rainfalls and reduces summer temperatures. In the lowlands and valleys there is often fog, especially in winter.

[[Spring (season)|Spring]] starts with 21 March and is characterised by colder weather with average daily temperature of {{convert|9|°C|0}} in the first weeks and about {{convert|14|°C|0}} in May and {{convert|17|°C|0}} in June. In Slovakia, the weather and climate in the spring is very unstable.

[[Summer]] starts on 22 June and is usually characterised by hot weather with daily temperatures exceeding {{convert|30|°C|0}}. July is the warmest month with temperatures up to about {{convert|37|to|40|C|F}}, especially in regions of southern Slovakia – in the urban area of Komárno, Hurbanovo or Štúrovo. Showers or thunderstorms may occur because of the summer monsoon called Medardova kvapka (Medard drop – 40 days of rain). Summer in Northern Slovakia is usually mild with temperatures around {{convert|25|°C|0|abbr=on}} (less in the mountains).

[[Autumn]] in Slovakia starts on 23 September and is mostly characterised by wet weather and wind, although the first weeks can be very warm and sunny. The average temperature in September is around {{convert|14|°C|0}}, in November to {{convert|3|°C|0}}. Late September and early October is a dry and sunny time of year (so-called Indian Summer).

[[Winter]] starts on 21 December with temperatures around {{convert|-5|to|-10|C|F}}. In December and January it is usually snowing, these are the coldest months of the year. At lower altitudes, snow does not stay the whole winter, it is changing into the thaw and frost. Winters are colder in the mountains, where the snow usually lasts until March or April and the night temperatures fall to {{convert|-20|°C|0|abbr=on}} and colder.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slovensko.com/about/weather-climate|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071026021233/http://www.slovensko.com/about/weather-climate|archivedate=26 October 2007 |title=Based on the "Climate" article from |publisher=www.slovensko.com |accessdate=10 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Slovakia signed the Rio [[Convention on Biological Diversity]] on 19 May 1993, and became a party to the convention on 25 August 1994.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbd.int/convention/parties/list/|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110124005746/http://www.cbd.int/convention/parties/list/|archivedate=24 January 2011 |title=List of Parties |accessdate=8 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has subsequently produced a [[Biodiversity action plan|National Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan]], which was received by the convention on 2 November 1998.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cbd.int/doc/world/sk/sk-nbsap-01-p1-en.pdf|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080721013840/https://www.cbd.int/doc/world/sk/sk-nbsap-01-p1-en.pdf|archivedate=21 July 2008 |title=National Biodiversity Strategy of Slovakia |accessdate=8 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The biodiversity of Slovakia comprises animals (such as annellids, arthropods, molluscs, nematodes and vertebrates), fungi ([[Ascomycota]], [[Basidiomycota]], [[Chytridiomycota]], [[Glomeromycota]] and [[Zygomycota]]), micro-organisms (including [[Mycetozoa]]), and plants.

=== Fungi ===
Over 4000 species of fungi have been recorded from Slovakia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cybertruffle.org.uk/robigalia/eng |title=Cybertruffle's Robigalia.

Of the lichen-forming species, about 40% have been classified as threatened in some way. About 7% are apparently extinct, 9% endangered, 17% vulnerable, and 7% rare. The conservation status of non-lichen-forming fungi in Slovakia is not well documented, but there is a red list for its larger fungi.&lt;ref&gt;Pavel Lizoň, ''Threatened macrofungi in Slovakia'' Biologia (Bratislava) 50: 9–12(1995).&lt;/ref&gt;

Slovakia is a [[parliamentary system|parliamentary democratic]] republic with a [[multi-party system]]. The last [[Slovak parliamentary election, 2016|parliamentary elections]] were held on 5 March 2016 and two rounds of [[Slovak presidential election, 2014|presidential elections]] took place on 15 and 29 March 2014.

The Slovak [[head of state]] and the formal head of the executive is the president (currently [[Andrej Kiska]]), though with very limited powers. The president is elected by direct, popular vote under the [[two-round system]] for a five-year term. Most [[executive (government)|executive]] power lies with the [[head of government]], the prime minister (currently [[Peter Pellegrini]]), who is usually the leader of the winning party, but he/she needs to form a majority coalition in the parliament. The prime minister is appointed by the president. The remainder of the cabinet is appointed by the president on the recommendation of the prime minister.

Slovakia's highest [[legislature|legislative]] body is the 150-seat [[unicameralism|unicameral]] [[National Council of the Slovak Republic]] (''Národná rada Slovenskej republiky''). Delegates are elected for a four-year term on the basis of [[proportional representation]].

Slovakia's highest [[judiciary|judicial body]] is the [[Constitutional Court of Slovakia]] (''Ústavný súd''), which rules on constitutional issues. The 13&amp;nbsp;members of this court are appointed by the president from a slate of candidates nominated by parliament.

The [[Constitution of Slovakia|Constitution of the Slovak Republic]] was ratified 1 September 1992, and became effective 1 January 1993. It was amended in September 1998 to allow [[direct election]] of the president and again in February 2001 due to EU admission requirements. The [[civil law (legal system)|civil law system]] is based on Austro-Hungarian codes. The [[code (law)|legal code]] was modified to comply with the obligations of [[Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe|Organization on Security and Cooperation in Europe]] (OSCE) and to expunge the [[Marxism–Leninism|Marxist–Leninist]] [[Law|legal theory]]. Slovakia accepts the compulsory [[International Court of Justice]] jurisdiction with reservations.

=== Human rights ===
[[United States Department of State|The US State Department]] in 2017 reported:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The government generally respected the human rights of its citizens; however, there were problems in some areas. The most significant human rights issues included incidents of interference with privacy; corruption; widespread discrimination against Roma minority; and security force violence against ethnic and racial minorities government actions and rhetoric did little to discourage. The government investigated reports of abuses by members of the security forces and other government institutions, although some observers questioned the thoroughness of these investigations. Some officials engaged in corrupt practices with impunity. Two former ministers were convicted of corruption during the year. &lt;ref&gt;U.S. Dept. of State, [https://www.state.gov/j/drl/rls/hrrpt/humanrightsreport/index.htm#wrapper "Country Reports on Human Rights Practices for 2017 – Slovakia" 27 September 2018]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Human rights in Slovakia are guaranteed by the [[Constitution of Slovakia]] from the year 1992 and by multiple international laws signed in Slovakia between 1948 and 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mzv.sk/servlet/content?MT=/App/WCM/main.nsf/vw_ByID/zahranicna__politika&amp;TG=BlankMaster&amp;URL=/App/WCM/main.nsf/vw_ByID/medzinarodne_zmluvy-zmluvy_podla_predmetu&amp;CTYPE=%C4%BDudsk%C3%A9%20pr%C3%A1va&amp;OpenDocument=Y&amp;LANG=SK&amp;PAGE_VSETKYZMLUVY-DWMCEA-7XEM76=1 |title=Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Slovakia – list of international acts relating to human rights |publisher=Mzv.sk |accessdate=10 September 2013 |df=dmy-all }}{{dead link|date=August 2017|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Administrative divisions ===
{{Main|Regions of Slovakia|Districts of Slovakia|List of municipalities and towns in Slovakia}}
[[File:Bratislava Cityscape.jpg|thumb|right|[[Bratislava]], capital and largest city of Slovakia]]
As for [[administrative division]], Slovakia is subdivided into 8 ''[[kraj]]ov'' (singular – ''kraj'', usually translated as "region"), each of which is named after its principal city. Regions have enjoyed a certain degree of autonomy since 2002. Their [[Self-governance|self-governing]] bodies are referred to as Self-governing (or autonomous) Regions (sg. ''samosprávny kraj'', pl. ''samosprávne kraje'') or Upper-Tier Territorial Units (sg. ''vyšší územný celok'', pl. ''vyššie územné celky'', abbr. VÚC).

The "kraje" are subdivided into many ''[[okres]]y'' (sg. ''okres'', usually translated as counties). Slovakia currently has 79&amp;nbsp;districts.

The ''okresy'' are further divided into ''[[List of municipalities and towns in Slovakia|obcí]]'' (sg. ''obec'', usually translated as "municipality"). There are currently 2,890 obcí.

In terms of economics and [[unemployment]] rate, the western regions are richer than eastern regions. Bratislava is the third richest region of the [[European Union]] by GDP (PPP) per capita (after [[Hamburg]] and [[Luxembourg City]]), GDP at purchasing power parity is about three times higher than in other Slovak regions.&lt;ref name="finweb.hnonline.sk"&gt;"[http://finweb.hnonline.sk/ekonomika/919558-bratislava-je-treti-najbohatsi-region-unie]."

The [[OECD]] in 2017 reported:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The Slovak Republic continues exhibiting robust economic performance, with strong growth backed by a sound financial sector, low public debt and high international competitiveness drawing on large inward investment.&lt;ref&gt;oecd.org, [http://www.oecd.org/slovakia/economic-survey-slovak-republic.htm "Economic Survey of the Slovak Republic 2017" 3 July 2017]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 2017, Slovakia was ranked by the [[International Monetary Fund]] as the 39th [[List of countries by GDP (PPP) per capita|richest country in the world]] (out of 187 countries), with purchasing power parity per capita GDP of $32,895. The country used to be dubbed the "[[Tatra Tiger]]". Slovakia successfully transformed from a centrally [[planned economy]] to a market-driven economy. Major [[privatisation]]s are completed, the banking sector is almost completely in private hands, and foreign investment has risen.

[[File:Eurozone.svg|thumb|left|upright=0.75|Slovakia is part of the [[Schengen Area]], the EU single market, and since 2009, the [[Eurozone]] (dark blue)]]
The Slovak economy is one of the fastest growing economies in Europe and [[List of countries by real GDP growth rate|3rd fastest]] in [[eurozone]] (2017). In 2007, 2008 and 2010 (with [[Gross domestic product|GDP]] growth of 10.5%, 6% and 4% retrospectively). In 2016, more than 86% of Slovak exports went to [[European Union]], and more than 50% of Slovak imports came from other European Union member states.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Intra-EU trade in goods - recent trends|url=http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/Intra-EU_trade_in_goods_-_recent_trends}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ratio of government debt to GDP in Slovakia reached 52% by the end of 2016, far below the OECD average.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oecd.org/slovakia/economic-survey-slovak-republic.htm Economic Survey of the Slovak Republic 2017]. oecd.org (3 July 2017).&lt;/ref&gt;

Unemployment, peaking at 19% at the end of 1999, decreased to 5,95% at the end of 2017, lowest recorded rate in Slovak history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.etrend.sk/ekonomika/nezamestnanost-na-slovensku-klesla-pod-sest-percent.html |title=Nezamestnanosť na Slovensku klesla pod šesť percent |trans-title=Unemployment rate under 6 percent| language=Slovak |accessdate=9 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Inflation dropped from an average annual rate of 12% in 2000 to just 3.3% in 2002, an election year, but it rose again in 2003–2004 because of rising labour costs and taxes. It reached only 1% in 2010 which is the lowest recorded rate since 1993.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ako-investovat.sk/index.php/inflacia-na-slovensku |title=Inflation in Slovakia since 1993 |publisher=Ako-investovat.sk |accessdate=10 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rate was at 4% in 2011.

Slovakia adopted the Euro currency on 1 January 2009 as the 16th member of the Eurozone. The euro in Slovakia was approved by [[European Commission|the European commission]] on 7 May 2008. The [[Slovak koruna]] was revalued on 28 May 2008 to 30.126 for 1 euro,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/feedarticle/7546478|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080601034210/http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/feedarticle/7546478|archivedate=1 June 2008|title=Slovakia revalues currency ahead of euro entry|first=Marcin|last=Grajewski|work=The Guardian|date=28 May 2008|accessdate=9 July 2010|deadurl=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was also the exchange rate for the euro.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/7495169.stm|title=Slovak euro exchange rate is set|publisher=BBC News|date=8 July 2008|accessdate=9 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Bratislava highrises 2009 4.jpg|thumb|High-rise buildings in Bratislava's business districts]]

Slovakia is an attractive country for [[Investment|foreign investors]] mainly because of its low wages, low tax rates and well educated [[labor force|labour force]]. In recent years, Slovakia has been pursuing a policy of encouraging foreign investment.

=== Energy ===
[[File:Mochovce - chladice veže.JPG|thumb|left|Nuclear Power Plant [[Mochovce Nuclear Power Plant|Mochovce]]]]

In 2012, Slovakia produced a total of 28,393 [[GWh]] of [[electricity]] while at the same time consumed 28 786 GWh. The slightly higher level of consumption than the capacity of production (- 393 GWh) meant the country was not self-sufficient in energy sourcing. Slovakia imported electricity mainly from the [[Czech Republic]] (9 961 GWh – 73.6% of total import) and exported mainly to [[Hungary]] (10 231 GWh – 78.2% of total export).

[[Nuclear power|Nuclear energy]] accounts for 53.8% of total electricity production in Slovakia, followed by 18.1% of [[Thermal power station|thermal power]] energy, 15.1% by [[hydro power]] energy, 2% by [[solar energy]], 9.6% by other sources and the rest 1.4% is imported.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work=Electricity consumption / production in Slovakia in 2012|url=http://www.sepsas.sk/seps/dokumenty/RocenkySed/Rocenka_SED_2012.pdf|title=National Control Centre of Slovakia|year=2013|accessdate=3 October 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131005021455/http://www.sepsas.sk/seps/dokumenty/RocenkySed/Rocenka_SED_2012.pdf|archivedate=5 October 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The two nuclear power-plants in Slovakia are in [[Jaslovské Bohunice Nuclear Power Plant|Jaslovské Bohunice]] and [[Mochovce Nuclear Power Plant|Mochovce]], each of them containing two operating reactors. Prior to the accession of Slovakia to the EU in 2004, the government agreed to turn-off the V1 block of [[Jaslovské Bohunice Nuclear Power Plant|Jaslovské Bohunice power-plant]], built in 1978. After deactivating the last of the two reactors of the V1 block in 2008, Slovakia instantly stopped being self-dependent in energy production.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}} Currently there is another block (V2) with two active reactors in [[Jaslovské Bohunice Nuclear Power Plant|Jaslovské Bohunice]]. It is scheduled for decommissioning in 2025. Two new reactors are under construction in Mochovce plant. The nuclear power production in Slovakia sometimes draws attention to [[Austria]]n green-energy activists who occasionally organise protests and block the borders between the two countries.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}

Bratislava's [[M.&amp;nbsp;R.&amp;nbsp;Štefánik Airport]] is the main [[international airport]] in Slovakia. It is located {{convert|9|km|mi|lk=out|abbr=off}} northeast of the city centre. It serves civil and governmental, scheduled and unscheduled domestic and international flights. The current runways support the landing of all common types of aircraft currently used. The airport has enjoyed rapidly growing passenger traffic in recent years; it served 279,028&amp;nbsp;passengers in 2000, 1,937,642 in 2006 and 2,024,142 in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work=Letisko M.R.

Slovakia contains many castles, most of which are in ruins. The best known castles include [[Bojnice Castle]] (often used as a filming location), [[Spiš Castle]], (on the UNESCO list), [[Orava Castle]], [[Bratislava Castle]], and the ruins of [[Devín Castle]]. [[Čachtice Castle]] was once the home of the world's most prolific female serial killer, the 'Bloody Lady', [[Elizabeth Báthory]].

Slovakia's position in Europe and the country's past (part of the multicultural [[Kingdom of Hungary]], the [[Habsburg]] monarchy and [[Czechoslovakia]]) made many cities and towns similar to the cities in the [[Czech Republic]] (such as [[Prague]]), [[Austria]] (such as [[Salzburg]]) or [[Hungary]] (such as [[Budapest]]). A historical center with at least one square has been preserved in many towns. Large historical centers can be found in [[Bratislava]], [[Trenčín]], [[Košice]], [[Banská Štiavnica]], [[Levoča]], and [[Trnava]]. Historical centers have been going through restoration in recent years.

Historical churches can be found in virtually every village and town in Slovakia. Most of them are built in the [[Baroque architecture|Baroque]] style, but there are also many examples of [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] and [[Gothic architecture]], for example [[Banská Bystrica]], Bardejov and [[Spišská Kapitula]]. The [[Basilica of St. James, Levoča|Basilica of St. James]] in Levoča with the tallest wood-carved altar in the world and the Church of the Holy Spirit in [[Žehra]] with medieval [[fresco]]s are UNESCO [[World Heritage Site]]s. The [[St. Martin's Concathedral]] in [[Bratislava]] served as the [[coronation]] church for the Kingdom of Hungary. The oldest sacral buildings in Slovakia stem from the [[Great Moravia]]n period in the 9th century.
Very precious structures are the complete wooden churches of northern and northern-eastern Slovakia. Most were built from the 15th century onwards by [[Catholic]]s, [[Lutheran]]s and members of [[Eastern Christianity|eastern-rite]] churches.

Typical souvenirs from Slovakia are dolls dressed in folk costumes, ceramic objects, crystal glass, carved wooden figures, [[črpák]]s (wooden pitchers), [[fujara]]s (a [[folk instrument]] on the UNESCO list) and [[valaška]]s (a decorated folk hatchet) and above all products made from [[husk|corn husks]] and wire, notably human figures. Souvenirs can be bought in the shops run by the state organisation ÚĽUV (''Ústredie ľudovej umeleckej výroby'' – Centre of [[Folk art|Folk Art]] Production). ''Dielo'' shop chain sells works of Slovak artists and craftsmen. These shops are mostly found in towns and cities.

Prices of imported products are generally the same as in the neighbouring countries, whereas prices of local products and services, especially food, are usually lower.

=== Science ===
The [[Slovak Academy of Sciences]] has been the most important scientific and research institution in the country since 1953. Slovaks have made notable scientific and technical contributions during the history. Slovakia is currently in the negotiation process of becoming a member of the [[European Space Agency]]. Observer status was granted in 2010, when Slovakia signed the General Agreement on Cooperation&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://slovak.space/sr-a-vesmir/spolupraca-s-esa/|title=Spolupráca s ESA - Slovak Space Portal|work=Slovak Space Portal|access-date=2017-11-05|language=sk-SK}}&lt;/ref&gt; in which information about ongoing education programmes was shared and Slovakia was invited to various negotiations of the ESA. In 2015, Slovakia signed the European Cooperating State Agreement based on which Slovakia committed to the finance entrance programme named PECS (Plan for the European Cooperating States) which serves as preparation for full membership. Slovak research and development organizations can apply for funding of projects regarding space technologies advancement. Full membership of Slovakia in the ESA is expected in 2020 after signing the ESA Convention. Slovakia will be obliged to set state budget inclusive ESA funding.

Slovakia is ranked among the top EU countries regarding the knowledge of foreign languages. In 2007, 68% of the population aged from 25 to 64 years claimed to speak two or more foreign languages, finishing 2nd highest in the European Union. The best known foreign language in Slovakia is [[Czech language|Czech]].

The [[Programme for International Student Assessment]], coordinated by the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development|OECD]], currently ranks [[education in Slovakia|Slovak secondary education]] the 30th in the world (placing it just below the United States and just above Spain).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/42/8/39700724.pdf |title=Range of rank on the PISA 2006 science scale at OECD |format=PDF |accessdate=16 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Education in Slovakia is compulsory from age 6 to 16. The education system consists of elementary school which is divided into two parts, the first grade (age 6–10) and the second grade (age 10–15) which is finished by taking nationwide testing called Monitor, from Slovak language and math. Parents may apply for social assistance for a child that is studying on an elementary school or a high-school. If approved, the state provides basic study necessities for the child. Schools provide books to all their students with usual exceptions of books for studying a foreign language and books which require taking notes in them, which are mostly present at the first grade of elementary school.

After finishing elementary school, students are obliged to take one year in high school.

After finishing a high school, students can go to university and are highly encouraged to do so. Slovakia has a wide range of universities. The biggest university is [[Comenius University]], established in 1919. Although it's not the first university ever established on Slovak territory, it's the oldest university that is still running. Most universities in Slovakia are public funded, where anyone can apply. Every citizen has a right for free education on public schools. 

Slovakia has several privately funded universities, however public universities consistently score better in the ranking than their private counterparts. Universities have different criteria for accepting students. Anyone can apply to any number of universities.

}}

[[Folk tradition]] has rooted strongly in Slovakia and is reflected in literature, music, dance and architecture. The prime example is a Slovak national anthem, ''"[[Nad Tatrou sa blýska]]"'', which is based on a melody from ''"[[Kopala studienku]]"'' folk song.

Manifestation of Slovak folklore culture is the "''Východná''" Folklore Festival. It is the oldest and largest nationwide festival with international participation,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title="Východná" festival|url=http://www.festivalvychodna.sk/en/}}&lt;/ref&gt; which takes place in [[Východná]] annually. Slovakia is usually represented by many groups but mainly by SĽUK (''Slovenský ľudový umelecký kolektív – Slovak folk art collective''). SĽUK is the largest Slovak folk art group, trying to preserve the folklore tradition.

An example of wooden folk architecture in Slovakia can be seen in the well preserved village of [[Vlkolínec]] which has been the [[UNESCO World Heritage Site]] since 1993.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=UNESCO information about Vlkolínec|url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/622}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Prešov Region]] preserves the world's most remarkable folk wooden churches. Most of them are protected by Slovak law as [[cultural heritage]], but some of them are on the [[UNESCO]] list too, in Bodružal, Hervartov, Ladomirová and Ruská Bystrá.

The best known Slovak hero, found in many folk [[mythologies]], is [[Juraj Jánošík]] (1688–1713) (the Slovak equivalent of [[Robin Hood]]). The legend says he was taking from the rich and giving to the poor. Jánošík's life was depicted in a list of literature works and many movies throughout the 20th century. One of the most popular is a [[film]] ''Jánošík'' directed by [[Martin Frič]] in 1935.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Jánošík movie on Czechoslovak Film Database|year=1935|url=http://www.csfd.cz/film/3113-janosik/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Visual art]] in Slovakia is represented through [[painting]], [[drawing]], [[printmaking]], [[illustration]], [[Handicraft|arts and crafts]], [[sculpture]], [[photography]] or [[conceptual art]]. The [[Slovak National Gallery]]  founded in [[1948 in art|1948]], is the biggest network of galleries in Slovakia. Two displays in Bratislava are situated in [[Esterházy Palace (Bratislava)|Esterházy Palace]] (''Esterházyho palác'') and the Water Barracks (''Vodné kasárne''), adjacent one to another. They are located on the Danube riverfront in the Old Town.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | publisher = Muzeum.sk | url = http://www.muzeum.bratislava.sk/en/vismo/dokumenty2.asp?id_org=700016&amp;id=1002&amp;p1=51 | title = Slovak National Gallery (SNG) Bratislava | date = n.d. |accessdate = May 17, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sng.sk/en/uvod/o-sng|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120311061018/http://www.sng.sk/en/uvod/o-sng|archivedate=11 March 2012 |title=About SNG – SNG |publisher=Sng.sk |accessdate=25 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Bratislava City Gallery]], founded in 1961 is the second biggest Slovak gallery of its kind. It stores about 35,000 pieces of Slovak and international art and offers permanent displays in [[Johann Pálffy Palace|Pálffy Palace]] and [[Mirbach Palace]], located in the Old Town. Danubiana Art Museum, one of the youngest art museums in Europe, is situated near [[Čunovo]] waterworks (part of [[Gabčíkovo - Nagymaros Dams|Gabčíkovo Waterworks]]). Other major galleries include: [[Andy Warhol Museum of Modern Art]],  [[East Slovak Gallery]], [[Ernest Zmeták Art Gallery]], [[Zvolen Castle]].

=== Literature ===
{{Further|Slovak literature}}
[[File:Bozetech Klemens Stur.jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|[[Ľudovít Štúr]], the author of the Slovak language standard]]

For a list of notable Slovak writers and poets, see [[Lists of Slovak authors|List of Slovak authors]].

Christian topics include: poem [[Proglas]] as a foreword to the four [[Gospel]]s, partial translations of the Bible into [[Old Church Slavonic]], ''Zakon sudnyj ljudem''.

[[Medieval literature]], in the period from the 11th to the 15th centuries, was written in [[Latin]], Czech and Slovakised Czech. Lyric (prayers, songs and formulas) was still controlled by the Church, while epic was concentrated on legends. Authors from this period include [[Johannes de Thurocz]], author of the [[Chronica Hungarorum]] and Maurus, both of them Hungarians.&lt;ref name=Phillips&gt;{{cite book |title=The dictionary of biographical reference: containing one hundred thousand names, together with a classed index of the biographical literature of Europe and America|last=Lawrence Barnett Phillips |authorlink=|year=1871 |publisher=S. Low, Son, &amp; Marston |location=|isbn=|page=1020}}&lt;/ref&gt; The worldly literature also emerged and chronicles were written in this period.

There were two leading persons who codified the Slovak language. The first was [[Anton Bernolák]] whose concept was based on the western Slovak [[dialect]] in 1787. It was the codification of the first ever literary language of Slovaks. The second was [[Ľudovít Štúr]], whose formation of the Slovak language took principles from the central Slovak dialect in 1843.

Slovakia is also known for its polyhistors, of whom include [[Pavel Jozef Šafárik|Pavol Jozef Šafárik]], [[Matthias Bel|Matej Bel]], [[Ján Kollár]], and its political revolutionaries and reformists, such [[Milan Rastislav Štefánik]] and [[Alexander Dubček]].

=== Cuisine ===

[[File:Halusky kapustnica.jpg|thumb|[[Halušky]] with [[bryndza]] cheese, [[Sourkrawt|kapustnica]] soup and Zlatý Bažant dark beer – examples of Slovak cuisine]]

Traditional Slovak cuisine is based mainly on [[pork]] meat, [[poultry]] ([[chicken]] is the most widely eaten, followed by [[duck]], [[goose]], and [[Turkey (bird)|turkey]]), [[flour]], [[potato]]es, [[cabbage]], and [[milk products]]. It is relatively closely related to [[Hungarian cuisine|Hungarian]], [[Czech cuisine|Czech]] and [[Austrian cuisine]]. On the east it is also influenced by [[Ukrainian cuisine|Ukrainian]] and [[Polish cuisine]]. In comparison with other European countries, [[Game (hunting)|"game meat"]] is more accessible in Slovakia due to vast resources of forest and because hunting is relatively popular.&lt;ref name="EuropeNations2000"&gt;{{cite book|author1=United Nations. Economic Commission for Europe|author2=Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations|title=Forest resources of Europe, CIS, North America, Australia, Japan and New Zealand (industrialised temperate/boreal countries): UN-ECE/FAO contribution to the Global Forest Resources Assessment 2000|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Xg_xAAAAMAAJ|year=2000|publisher=United Nations|isbn=978-92-1-116735-1|pages=347–|quote=In some countries, the commercial sale of game meat is an important economic activity, including the export of game meat. ... value in the Netherlands, and as the value of export, domestic consumption, and industrial processing in Slovakia.}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Boar]], [[rabbit]], and [[venison]], are generally available throughout the year. [[Sheep|Lamb]] and [[goat]] are eaten but are not widely popular.

The traditional Slovak meals are [[bryndzové halušky]], [[bryndzové pirohy]] and other meals with potato dough and [[bryndza]]. Bryndza is a salty cheese made of a sheep milk, characterised by a strong taste and aroma. Bryndzové halušky must be on the menu of every traditional Slovak restaurant.

A typical soup is a [[sauerkraut]] soup ("kapustnica"). A [[Black pudding|blood sausage]] called "krvavnica", made from any and all parts of a butchered pig is also a specific Slovak meal.

Wine is enjoyed throughout Slovakia. [[Slovak wine]] comes predominantly from the southern areas along the Danube and its tributaries; the northern half of the country is too cold and mountainous to grow grapevines. Traditionally, white wine was more popular than red or rosé (except in some regions), and [[Sweetness of wine|sweet wine]] more popular than dry, but in recent years tastes seem to be changing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slovakiasite.com/slovak-cuisine.php |title=Slovak Cuisine |publisher=Slovakiasite.com |accessdate=16 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beer (mainly of the [[pilsener]] style, though [[Dunkel|dark lagers]] are also consumed) is also popular.

=== Sport ===
{{Main|Sport in Slovakia}}
Sporting activities are practised widely in Slovakia, many of them on a professional level. [[Ice hockey]] and [[association football|football]] have traditionally been regarded as the most popular sports in Slovakia, though [[tennis]], [[Team handball|handball]], [[basketball]], [[volleyball]], [[whitewater slalom]], [[cycling]] and [[athletics (sport)|athletics]] are also popular.

;Ice Hockey

One of the most popular team sports in Slovakia is [[ice hockey]]. Slovakia became a member of the [[IIHF]] on 2 February 1993&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iihf.com/sk/iihf-home/countries/slovakia.html |title=Slovakia |publisher=Iihf.com |date=2 February 1993 |accessdate=25 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and since then has won 4 medals in [[Ice Hockey World Championships]], consisting of 1 gold, 2 silver and 1 bronze. The most recent success was a silver medal at the [[2012 IIHF World Championship]] in [[Helsinki]]. The Slovak national hockey team made five appearances in the Olympic games, finishing 4th in the [[2010 Winter Olympics]] in [[Vancouver]]. The country has 8280 registered players and is ranked 7th in the [[IIHF World Ranking]] at present. Prior to 2012, the Slovak team [[HC Slovan Bratislava]] participated in the [[Kontinental Hockey League]], considered the strongest hockey league in Europe, and the second-best in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iihf.com/fi/home-of-hockey/news/news-singleview/recap/6876.html |title=World of difference for KHL? |publisher=iihf.com |date=7 May 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130123082543/http://www.iihf.com/fi/home-of-hockey/news/news-singleview/recap/6876.html |archivedate=23 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Slovakia hosted the [[2011 IIHF World Championship]], where [[Finland men's national ice hockey team|Finland]] won the gold medal. Competitions took place in [[Bratislava]] and [[Košice]].

;Football
[[File:CityArena.jpg|thumb|left|Football stadium [[Štadión Antona Malatinského|City Arena]] in [[Trnava]]]]
Association football is the most popular sport in Slovakia, with over 400,000 registered players. Since 1993, the [[Slovak national football team]] has qualified for the [[FIFA World Cup]] once, in [[2010 FIFA World Cup|2010]]. They progressed to the last 16, where they were defeated by the  [[Netherlands national football team|Netherlands]]. The most notable result was the 3–2 victory over [[Italy national football team|Italy]]. In 2016, the [[Slovak national football team]] qualified for the [[UEFA Euro 2016]] tournament, under head coach [[Ján Kozák (footballer, born 1954)|Ján Kozák]]. This helped the team reach their best ever position of 14th in the [[FIFA World Rankings]].

In club competitions, only three teams have qualified for the [[UEFA Champions League]] Group Stage, namely [[MFK Košice]] in [[1997–98 UEFA Champions League|1997–98]], [[FC Artmedia Bratislava]] in [[2005–06 UEFA Champions League|2005–06 season]], and [[MŠK Žilina]] in [[2010–11 UEFA Champions League|2010–11]]. FC Artmedia Bratislava has been the most successful team, finishing 3rd at the Group Stage of the [[2005–06 UEFA Cup|UEFA Cup]], therefore qualifying for the knockout stage. They remain the only Slovak club that has won a match at the group stage.

The '''Voice of Vietnam''' (also '''Radio the Voice of Vietnam''', [[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese]]: ''Đài Tiếng nói Việt Nam'') is the [[Vietnam]] national radio broadcaster.

The first [[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese-language]] radio transmission was made on 2 September 1945, when the President [[Ho Chi Minh]] read out the Declaration of Independence.

As of 2004, it was estimated that VOV programs reached more than 90% of all households in Vietnam.

== History ==
Prior to 1945, the Vietnamese were banned from owning radio receivers,{{citation needed|date=February 2013}} and broadcasting was under control of the [[French Indochina|French colonial government]], which established the first radio station in Vietnam, Radio Saigon, in the late 1920s.

Vietnam's national radio station, now called the Voice of Vietnam, started broadcasting from [[Hanoi]] the just a week after declaration of the [[North Vietnam|Democratic Republic of Vietnam]] with the declaration "''This is the Voice of Vietnam, broadcasting from Hanoi, the capital of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam''.”&lt;ref name=vov&gt;{{cite web|title=Historic Milestones|url=http://tnvn.gov.vn:9988/Home/mls.vov|work=Radio the Voice of Vietnam website|publisher=Radio the Voice of Vietnam|accessdate=14 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  During the [[Vietnam War]], [[Radio Hanoi]] operated as a propaganda tool of [[North Vietnam]]. In August 1968, Voice of Vietnam commenced shortwave broadcasts for Vietnamese living abroad.&lt;ref name=vov/&gt;

[[South Vietnam]] set up its own network in Saigon in 1955.

Following [[History of Vietnam#Aftermath of the Vietnam War and Reunification|Reunification]], all of the radio stations were combined into the Voice of Vietnam, which became the national radio station in 1978.

==Broadcasting==
Today, VOV strives to offer diverse, high-quality programming and in every aspect of mass media. It broadcasts on many channels, repeated on [[AM broadcasting|Medium wave (MW) AM]], [[FM broadcasting|FM]] and [[shortwave|shortwave (SW) AM]] bands throughout Vietnam and the rest of the world.

The '''World Ocean Database Project''', or '''WOD''', is a project established by the [[Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission]] (IOC). The project leader is Sydney Levitus who is director of the [[International Council for Science]] (ICSU) World Data Center (WDC) for Oceanography, Silver Spring.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ioc-unesco.org/index.php?option=com_oe&amp;task=viewDocumentRecord&amp;docID=1102|title=Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission|website=www.ioc-unesco.org|language=en-gb|access-date=2017-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; In recognition of the success of the IOC [[Global Oceanographic Data Archaeological and Rescue Project]] (GODAR project), a proposal was presented at the 16th Session of the Committee on [[International Oceanographic Data and Information Exchange]] (IODE), which was held in [[Lisbon, Portugal]], in October–November 2000, to establish the World Ocean Database Project. This project is intended to stimulate international exchange of modern oceanographic data and encourage the development of regional oceanographic databases as well as the implementation of regional quality control procedures. This new Project was endorsed by the IODE at the conclusion of the Portugal meeting, and the IOC subsequently approved this project in June 2001.

The World Ocean Database represents the world’s largest collection of ocean profile-plankton data available internationally without restriction. Data comes from the: (a) Sixty-five National Oceanographic Data Centers and nine Designated National Agencies (DNAs) (in Croatia, Finland, Georgia, Malaysia, Romania, Senegal, Sweden, Tanzania, and Ukraine), (b) International Ocean Observing Projects such as the completed [[World Ocean Circulation Experiment]] (WOCE) and Joint Global Ocean Flux Study (JGOFS), as well as currently active programs such as [[CLIVAR]] and Argo, (c) International Ocean Data Management Projects such as the IOC/IODE Global Oceanographic Data Archaeology and Rescue Project (GODAR), and (d) Real-time Ocean Observing Systems such as the IOC/IODE [[Global Temperature-Salinity Profile Program|Global Temperature-Salinity Profile Project]] (GTSPP). All ocean data acquired by WDC Silver Spring – USA are considered as part of the WDC archive and are freely available as public domain data.

==Comparison of World Ocean Databases==
The World Ocean Database was first released in 1994&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nodc.noaa.gov/OC5/indpub.html#World%20Ocean%20Atlas%201994 |title=World Ocean Atlas 1994 series |publisher=[[National Oceanographic Data Center]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; and updates have been released approximately every four years, 1998,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nodc.noaa.gov/OC5/indpub.html#World%20Ocean%20Atlas%201998 |title=World Ocean Atlas 1998 series |publisher=[[National Oceanographic Data Center]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; 2001,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nodc.noaa.gov/OC5/WOA01/pr_woa01.html |title=World Ocean Atlas 2001 |publisher=[[National Oceanographic Data Center]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nodc.noaa.gov/OC5/WOA05/pr_woa05.html |title=World Ocean Atlas 2005 |publisher=[[National Oceanographic Data Center]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most recent World Ocean Database series, WOD09, was released in September 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nodc.noaa.gov/OC5/WOA09/pr_woa09.html |title=World Ocean Atlas 2009 |publisher=[[National Oceanographic Data Center]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The WOD09 has more than 9 million temperature profiles and 3.6 million salinity profiles. The table shows a comparison of the number of stations by instrument type in WOD09 with previous NODC/WDC global ocean databases.

==Instrument Types==

Ocean profile, plankton data, and metadata are available in the World Ocean Database for
29 depth-dependent variables (physical and biochemical) and 11 instruments types: Ocean Station Data (OSD), Mechanical Bathythermograph (MBT), Expendable Bathythermograph (XBT), [[Conductivity, Temperature, Depth]] (CTD), Undulating Oceanographic Recorder (UOR), Profiling Float (PFL), Moored Buoy (MRB), Drifting Buoy (DRB), Gliders (GLD), Autonomous Pinniped Bathythermograph (APB).

==Word Ocean Database Products==

The data in the World Ocean Database are made available through the online search and retrieval system known as WOD''select''. The [[World Ocean Atlas]] (WOA''select'') series is a set of gridded (1° grid), climatological, objectively analyzed fields  of the variables in the World Ocean Database. The WOA''select'' is a selection tool by which the user can designate a geographic area, depth, and oceanographic variable to view climatological means or related statistics for a given variable at the requested depth for the requested geographic area.
