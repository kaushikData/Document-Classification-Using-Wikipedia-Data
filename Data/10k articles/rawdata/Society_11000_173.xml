'''Adire''' ([[Yoruba language|Yoruba]]: tie and dye) textile is the [[indigo]]-[[dye]]d [[cloth]] made in southwestern [[Nigeria]] by [[Yoruba people|Yoruba]] women, using a variety of [[resist dyeing|resist-dyeing]] techniques.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fashion-history.lovetoknow.com/fabrics-fibers/adire|author=Norma Wolff|title=Adire|website=Fashion History:Love to know|accessdate=December 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vam.ac.uk/content/articles/a/adire-indigo-resist-dyed-cloth-from-yorubaland-nigeria/|title=Adire – Indigo Resist Dyed Cloth From Yorubaland, Nigeria|website=Vam|location=United Kingdom|accessdate=December 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

The earliest pieces of this type were probably simple tied designs on cotton cloth [[Spinning (textiles)|handspun]] and [[weaving|woven]] locally (rather like those still produced in [[Mali]]), but in the early decades of the 20th century new access to large quantities of imported [[shirt]]ing material via the spread of European textile merchants in [[Abeokuta]] and other Yoruba towns caused a boom in these women's entrepreneurial and artistic efforts, making adire a major local craft in Abeokuta and [[Ibadan]], attracting buyers from all over West Africa. Abeokuta is considered to be the capital of adire making in Nigeria,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Saheed|first=Zakaree|date=23 August 2017|title=Adire Textile: A cultural heritage and entrepreneurial craft in Egbaland, Nigeria|url=http://www.ea-journals.org|journal=International Journal of Small Business and Entrepreneurial Research|volume=|pages=11–18|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; however some suggest that the large cities of Ibadan and Osogbo (Yorubaland) are more important in Adire making because Adire dyeing began in Abeokuta when Egba women from Ibadan returned with this knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Adire cloth in Nigeria|last=Simmonds|first=Doig|publisher=Doig D, Simmonds; Institute of African Studies, University of Ibadan.|year=2016|isbn=|location=Ibadan|pages=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cloth's basic shape became that of two pieces of shirting material stitched together to create a women's wrapper cloth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.eajournals.org/wp-content/uploads/ADIRE-TEXTILE.pdf|title=Adire Textile: A cultural heritage|format=pdf|website=EA Journals|author=Z.S. Saheed}}&lt;/ref&gt; New techniques of [[resist dyeing]] developed.

The tradition of indigo dyeing goes back centuries in West Africa. The earliest known example is a cap from the [[Dogon people|Dogon kingdom]] in [[Mali]] dating to the [[11th century]], dyed in the ''oniko'' style.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

However, by the end of the 1930s the spread of synthetic [[indigo]] and caustic [[Sodium hydroxide|soda]] and an influx of new less skilled entrants caused quality problems and a still-present collapse in demand.  Though the more complex and beautiful starch resist designs continued to be produced until the early 1970s, and despite a revival prompted largely by the interest of US [[Peace Corps]] workers in the 1960s, never regained their earlier popularity. In the present day, simplified stenciled designs and some better quality oniko and alabere designs are still produced, but local taste favours "[[kampala]]" (multi-coloured [[wax resist]] cloth, sometimes also known as adire by a few people). However, there has been a recent revival of the Adire art by Nigerian artisans such as [[Nike Davies-Okundaye]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/946010715|title=Fashion Cities Africa|last=|first=|publisher=|others=Pool, Hannah, 1974-, Royal Pavilion, Art Gallery, and Museums.|year=|isbn=9781783206117|location=Bristol, UK|pages=98–99|oclc=946010715}}&lt;/ref&gt; who has inspired a younger generation of designers like [[Amaka Osakwe]] (and her label Maki-Oh) and [[Duro Olowu]]. Political figures and celebrities such as [[Michelle Obama]] and [[Lupita Nyong'o]] have worn adire-inspired clothes recently.

== Techniques ==
[[File:Tie and Dye to the rescue (Adire).jpg|thumb|A woman dyeing cotton]]
Today, there are three primary resist techniques used in Nigeria:
* '''Oniko''': this process involves tying raffia around hundreds of individual corn kernels or pebbles to produce small white circles on a blue background. The fabric can also be twisted and tied on itself or folded into stripes.
* '''Alabere''': Stitching raffia onto the fabric in a pattern prior to dyeing. The raffia palm is stripped, and the spine sewn into the fabric. After dyeing the raffia is usually ripped out, although some choose to leave it in and let wear and tear on the garment slowly reveal the design.
* '''Eleko''': Resist dyeing with cassava paste painted onto the fabric. Traditionally done with different size chicken feathers, calabash carved into different designs are also used, in a manner similar to [[Woodblock printing|block printing]]. Since the early twentieth century, metal stencils cut from the sheets of tin that lined tea chests have also been used.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Indigo Quilts|last=Triplett|first=Kay and Lori Lee|publisher=C&amp;T Publishing|year=2015|isbn=978-1-61745-243-7|location=Concord, CA|pages=14–18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ctpub.com/blog/adire-african-indigo-resist/|title=Adire: African Resist|last=Triplett|first=Lori Lee|date=October 14, 2015|website=C&amp;T Publishing|publisher=C&amp;T Publishing|access-date=April 1, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Most of the designs are named, with popular ones including the jubilee pattern, (first produced for the [[silver jubilee]] of [[George V of the United Kingdom|George V]] and [[Mary of Teck|Queen Mary]] in 1935), [[Olokun]] ("goddess of the sea"),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/960700743|title=Adirẹ cloth in Nigeria, 1971-2016|last=|first=|publisher=|others=Simmonds, Doig,, Oyelola, Pat,, Ọkẹ, Ṣẹgun,|year=2016|isbn=9780993532405|edition=Second|location=[Place of publication not identified]|pages=6–7|oclc=960700743}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sunbebe ("lifting up of the beads")&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Adire cloth in Nigeria|last=Simmonds|first=Doig|publisher=University of Ibadan|year=2016|isbn=978-0-9935324-0-5|location=Nigeria|pages=49}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Ibadandun]] ("Ibadan is sweet").&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/960700743|title=Adirẹ cloth in Nigeria, 1971-2016|last=|first=|publisher=|others=Simmonds, Doig,, Oyelola, Pat,, Ọkẹ, Ṣẹgun,|year=|isbn=9780993532405|edition=Second|location=[Place of publication not identified]|pages=47–48|oclc=960700743}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nigeria is also known for its two-tone indigo resist designs, created by repeat dyeing of cloth painted with cassava root paste to create a deep blue; the paste is then washed out and the cloth dyed a final time. Quality cloth is dyed 25 or more times to create a deep blue-black color before the paste is washed out. Additional forms of indigo resist-dyeing exist in other parts of West Africa; for example, the Bamana of Mali use mud resist, while Senegalese dyers use rice paste rather than cassava root. And the Ndop of Cameroon use both stitch resist and wax resist.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The '''Amur-Ussuri Cossacks''' are the combined peoples of the [[Amur Cossack Host]] and the [[Ussuri Cossack Host]].  Early in their history they intermarried with or incorporated into their units many [[Tungusic peoples]].  This was a key element in their considering themselves a separate people from other Cossacks.

'''Bataidari system''' is a [[sharecropping]], an agricultural practice where a [[landowner]] lends his land to another who spends money and labour and the produce is shared by the owner and the tenant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.epw.in/web-exclusives/nitish-kumars-honourable-exit-brief-history-caste-politics.html |title=Nitish Kumar's Honourable Exit: A brief history of caste politics|publisher= Economic and Political Weekly|date= |accessdate=2013-07-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; it is prevalent in the state of [[Bihar]] in [[India]] where nearly 35% of cultivable land is under this system.&lt;ref name=toi10&gt;{{cite web|author=Arun Kumar |url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2010-10-11/patna/28268572_1_cpi-ml-land-reforms-vijaykant-thakur |title=Land reforms, bataidari' tops Left agenda |publisher=The Times Of India |date=2010-10-11 |accessdate=2013-07-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2010-05-31/india/28291828_1_bjp-ministers-bihar-bjp-bjp-office |title=Bihar BJP chief banks on Nitish for smooth seat-sharing talks |publisher==The Times Of India |date=2010-05-31 |accessdate=2013-07-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Singh2005"&gt;{{cite book|author=Sita Ram Singh|title=Land Reforms And Farm Diversity|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uV-QYlm9FEQC&amp;pg=PA81|accessdate=1 July 2013|date=1 January 2005|publisher=APH Publishing|isbn=978-81-7648-838-9|pages=81–82}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The system was prevalent during [[British Raj]] in many parts of India, including fertile plains of [[Punjab region|Punjab]], in other places the ''[[jotedar]]'' system was prevalent.

'''[[Belarusians]]''' are a major ethnic group in [[Russia]]. In the [[Russian Census (2002)|census of 2002]], 807,970 Russian citizens confirmed their Belarusian ethnicity.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.perepis2002.ru/ct/html/TOM_04_01.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Major Belarusian groups live in the regions of [[Moscow]], [[St. Petersburg]], [[Kaliningrad]], [[Karelia]]. Most Belarusians in Russia are migrants from modern Belarus or their descendants, while a minor part of Belarusians in Russia are indigenous.

==Geography==
[[File:Belarusians by federal subject 2010.svg|thumb|left|400 px|Distribution of Belarusians in Russia]]
A minor part of Belarusians in Russia are original inhabitants of the Russian-Belarusian border regions. In ancient times the regions of [[Smolensk]] and [[Pskov]] were inhabited by the East Slavic tribe of [[Krivichi]] that later became major base of the Russian and Belarusian nations. The Russian town of Smolensk was several times conquered by [[Polatsk]] dukes{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} and belonged to the [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]] between 1408 and 1514.

According to the census of the [[Russian Empire]], some Belarusians lived in the territories of modern [[Smolensk Oblast]], [[Bryansk Oblast]]. A small number of Belarusians used to live in the modern [[Kaluga Oblast]], [[Pskov Oblast]], [[Orel Oblast]].

The [[Korenization]] policies of the 1920s encouraged Belarusians of Russia to promote and develop Belarusian cultural life and education. A system of Belarusian schools was established in Western Russia. In the 1930s, the Korenization was reversed and its proponents were repressed.

===Moscow===
During the [[Polonization]] of the Grand Duchy in the 16th and 17th centuries, a large number of Orthodox Ruthenians, led by Princes [[Mstislavsky]], [[Belsky family (Gediminid)|Belsky]] and [[Galitzine]], escaped the repressions to Moscow. In documents of that time they are also called ''[[Litvin]]s'' or ''[[White Ruthenia]]ns''.

One of the compact settlements of Litvins in Moscow was the Meschanskaya Sloboda. Its inhabitants engaged in financial operations, trade, and medicine. Meschanskaya Sloboda had a degree of self-governance and a collegiate church.

In the times of [[Imperial Russia]] and the [[USSR]], Moscow as the scientific and economic centre of the country attracted many specialists from different parts of the empire including Belarus. So, the minister of foreign affairs of the USSR during the most tensed period of the [[Cold War]] was the Belarusian [[Andrei Gromyko]].

Today, Moscow also attracts huge numbers of specialists for constant and temporary work. Every year hundreds of students from Belarus join Moscow universities.

===St. Petersburg===
After the [[Partition of Poland]], Belarusians started migrating to Russia including the imperial capital, [[St. Petersburg]]. Especially many peasants from northern and eastern regions of Belarus migrated to St. Petersburg.

According to statistics, from 1869 to 1910 the number of Belarusians in St. Petersburg grew 23 times and reached 70,000.

In the second half of the 19th century, several Belarusian organisations were created in St. Petersburg uniting intellectuals and students. In 1868 the enlightenment organisation ''[[Kryvitski vazok]]'' was founded. In the 1880s the organisation of leftist Belarusian intellectuals ''[[Homan (1884)|Homan]]'' was created. Along with [[Wilno]], St. Petersburg has been the centre of Belarusian cultural an intellectual life in the late 19th century. A Belarusian publishing house existed in St. Petersburg in 1906-1912. Belarusian scientists at the universities of St. Petersburg made important ethnographic researches about Belarus.

The activity of organisations of Belarusian diaspora continued after the [[October Revolution]] until it was violently stopped by [[Stalinist]] repressions.

During the [[Perestroika]], several new Belarusian diaspora organisations appeared in Leningrad. Today St. Petersburg, though less than Moscow, is also attractive for workers and students from Belarus.

===Siberia===
Siberia was goal for mass migrations from Belarus in the 19th century. First, Russians deported participants of [[January Uprising|January]] [[November uprising]]s. During the period 1885–1914, 550 thousand Belarusians settled to Siberia. Entire Belarusian villages existed there.

After the [[October Revolution]], the stream of migrants from Belarus to Siberia did not stop. The Soviets tried to organise their flow and sanctioned several researches on the history and traditions of Siberian Belarusian. In 1929 the [[National Academy of Sciences of Belarus]] organised a special ethnographic expedition to Siberia. In the census of 1926, 371,840 Siberians stated their Belarusian descent.

[[Korenization]] allowed the Belarusian minority in [[RSFSR]] to develop its culture and language. Belarusian schools were created in Siberia.

In the 1930s and early 1940s many Russian, Ukrainian, and Belarusian intellectuals and peasants were deported to Siberia, including those from [[West Belarus]] when annexed to the BSSR.

In the late 1980s the [[Belarusian national revival]] movement also affected Siberian Belarusians. [[Jan Cherski Society for Belarusian Culture]] was established in [[Irkutsk]] and is now the largest and most active organisation of the Belarusian diaspora in [[Russia]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

==Other regions==
In the 18th century Belarusians lived in several [[gubernya]]s of European Russia. Belarusian settlements existed in [[Kursk]], [[Penza Oblast|Penza]] gubernyas and in the [[Ural (region)|Ural]].

After cancellation of [[serfdom]] in Russia in the 19th century, mass migrations of Belarusian peasants to Russia started. Main goals were [[Volga]] region, [[Caucasus]], [[Central Asia]] and [[Siberia]].

From the late 1940s to early 1960s many Belarusians settled in [[Republic of Karelia|Karelia]], [[Arkhangelsk Oblast]], the [[Komi Republic]], and [[Kaliningrad Oblast]].

==Belarusian territorial autonomies in Russia==
&lt;!---COMMENTED OUT WP:TE STATEMENT. BOTH NATIONS, UNLIKE THOSE WITH AUTONOMIES IN RU, HAVE THEIR OWN STATES---Belarusians are the second largest ethnic group in Russia (after [[Ukrainians]]) that does not have a territorial autonomy.---&gt;

Belarusian [[Romantic nationalism|national revival]] in [[RSFSR]] in early Soviet times included creation of Belarusian local autonomies - national Rural Soviets (сельсоветы) inside [[raion]]s. In 1924–1926, 71 Belarusian rural soviets were created in Siberia. In 1926 there were 26 Belarusian rural soviets in the Russian Far East. In the Ural in 1928 there were eleven. Later, several Belarusian [[raion]]y, administrative units of a higher level, were created. In the early 1930s there was a Belarusian national raion of Taboryn as part of the [[Ural (region)|Ural]] oblast. There was a discussion about the creation of a Belarusian national unit inside the [[Omsk]] oblast.

In the mid-1930s all Belarusian autonomies inside the [[RSFSR]] were liquidated.

Because of cultural closeness of Belarusians to [[Russians]] and weakly expressed national identity, Belarusians are more than other ethnic minorities exposed to assimilation in Russia. Despite mass inflow of migrants from Belarus during last centuries, children of immigrants rarely identify themselves as Belarusians.

Currently, more and more Belarusian organisations are created in different regions of Russia.

In 2003 a Belarusian cultural society ''Belorusy Yugry'' was registered in [[Surgut]].

The largest and strongest Belarusian diaspora organisation in Russia is the [[Jan Čerski Society for Belarusian Culture]] in Irkutsk. The organisation unites descendants of Belarusian settlers in Siberia, and has several branches and issues a newspaper.

In Moscow there is the [[Frantsishak Skaryna Society for Belarusian Culture]] and an informal union of Belarusian students. In [[Bashkortostan]] there is a Belarusian national cultural centre ''Siabry'' founded in 1996. In [[Kaliningrad]] Belarusians are united in the culture society ''Karalaviec''.

In the last decade Belarusian community of Russia is of separate opinion on the current presidency of [[Alexander Lukashenko]]. Some organisations support the democratic opposition. Other, more recently founded organisations as the [[Federal National Cultural Autonomy of Belarusians in Russia]] are supported by the embassy of Belarus, and have a more positive opinion on the policies of the government.

Besides Russian citizens of Belarusian descent, there are about 400 thousands Belarusians currently working in Russia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://finance.rol.ru/news/article02D6C/default.asp|script-title=ru:Павел Бородин: 'Между Россией и Беларусью практически нет границ'|trans-title=Pavel Borodin: 'Between Russia and Belarus, in practice there are no boundaries'|language=ru|publisher=finance.rol.ru|date=20 May 2005|accessdate=6 October 2006|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929102837/http://finance.rol.ru/news/article02D6C/default.asp|archivedate=29 September 2007|df=dmy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Beti people''' are a [[Central Africa]]n ethnic group primarily found in central [[Cameroon]].&lt;ref name="Gates178"/&gt; They are also found in [[Equatorial Guinea]] and northern [[Gabon]]. They are closely related to the [[Bulu people]], the [[Fang people]] and the [[Yaunde people]], who are all sometimes grouped as [[Beti-Pahuin peoples]].&lt;ref name="Gates178"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Anthony Appiah|author2=Henry Louis Gates|title=Encyclopedia of Africa|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=A0XNvklcqbwC |year=2010|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-533770-9|pages=177–178, 460}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=britbetip&gt;[https://www.britannica.com/topic/Fang-people Fang people], and [https://www.britannica.com/topic/Yaunde Yaunde people], Encyclopædia Britannica&lt;/ref&gt;

The Beti are found in northern regions of their joint demographic distributions, the Fang in the southern regions, and others in between. Estimates of the total Beti population vary, with many sources placing them at over three million spread from the Atlantic coastal regions near Equatorial Guinea into the hilly, equatorial forest covered highlands of central Africa reaching into the Congo.&lt;ref name="Gates178"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Shoup2011p59"&gt;{{cite book|author=John A. Shoup|title=Ethnic Groups of Africa and the Middle East: An Encyclopedia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SPBfnT_E1mgC&amp;pg=PA60 |year=2011|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=978-1-59884-362-0|pages=59–62}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Language==
The Beti people, like the other Beti-Pahuin peoples speak a dialect of the Fang language,&lt;ref name="Gates178"/&gt; also known as Pahuin or Pangwe. Sometimes called as the Beti language, it is a Southern Bantu language belonging to the Niger-Congo family of languages.&lt;ref name=ethnobeti/&gt;&lt;ref name="Mazama2009p142"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Molefi Kete Asante|author2=Ama Mazama|title=Encyclopedia of African Religion|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=B667ATiedQkC |year=2009|publisher=SAGE|isbn=978-1-4129-3636-1|page=142}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Beti language is sub-classified as Bulu language, Eton language, Ewondo language and Fang language because though different, they are mutually intelligible to respective speakers.&lt;ref name=ethnobeti/&gt; While the languages are similar, there are linguistic differences suggesting a complex interaction between these peoples.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Jan M. Vansina|title=Paths in the Rainforests: Toward a History of Political Tradition in Equatorial Africa|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6M8Wv0Tp8VwC |year=1990|publisher=University of Wisconsin Press|isbn=978-0-299-12573-8|pages=134–137}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{double image|left|Bassin Sanaga Mbam.jpg|96|Falls1 Ekom Nkam.jpg|200|The Beti people migrated south and west from the Sanaga River basin into equatorial forests regions.&lt;ref name="Shoup2011p59"/&gt;}}
The Beti people are [[Bantu peoples|Bantu]] people who once lived in northern parts of Central Africa, with a complex, undocumented and debated prehistory.&lt;ref&gt;Pierre Alexandre (1965), [https://www.jstor.org/stable/4390910 Proto-histoire du groupe beti-bulu-fang: essai de synthèse provisoire], Cahiers d'Études Africaines, Vol. 5, Cahier 20 (1965), pages 503-560 (in French)&lt;/ref&gt; They likely moved into equatorial Africa in the seventh or eighth century, then further southwest in central Cameroon between the seventeenth and nineteenth centuries, likely after waves of wars and slave raids from the [[Fulani people]].&lt;ref name="Gates178"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Guyer | first=Jane I. | title=Female farming and the evolution of food production patterns amongst the Beti of south-central Cameroon | journal=Africa | publisher=Cambridge University Press | volume=50 | issue=04 | year=1980 | pages=341–356 | doi=10.2307/1158427 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Toyin Falola|author2=Daniel Jean-Jacques|title=Africa: An Encyclopedia of Culture and Society |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YjoVCwAAQBAJ |year=2015|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=978-1-59884-666-9|pages=143–144}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were also a targeted source for slaves and ivory by the [[Hausa people]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Frederick Quinn|title=In Search of Salt: Changes in Beti (Cameroon) Society, 1880-1960|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bpbfCwAAQBAJ |year=2006|publisher=Berghahn Books|isbn=978-1-78238-884-5|page=63}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Their initial migration in the 17th century was from highlands and forested regions east of the [[Sanaga River]] towards south and west. They continued to face jihads and violence from the north by the Fulani people (also called Fulbe or Fula people), abandoned their settlements and migrated further into southern parts of central Cameroon till the 19th century when European traders and colonial forces intervened as they sought trade and markets.&lt;ref name="Shoup2011p59"/&gt; The first European power to create a colony that partly included the lands of the Beti people was the German Kamerun colony in 1884. After the first world war, the German colony was taken over, divided by the French and the British colonial powers.&lt;ref name="Shoup2011p61"/&gt;

===Allegations of cannibalism===
In 1856, [[Paul Du Chaillu]] met the Beti people. He published a memoir about them in 1863. The memoir mentions his arrival on the Atlantic coast and being told by local people about the cannibalistic Beti people. When Du Chaillu met the Beti people, he saw skulls and bones near their settlement. He immediately took these for cannibalism and wrote about it in his memoir. Later visitors such as the ethnographer [[Mary Kingsley]] in 1893–1895, who did not speak the Beti language or live with the local people, saw the same sighting, and titled her book ''"A Victorian Woman Explorer among the Man-eaters"''.&lt;ref name="Shoup2011p59"/&gt;

In 1912, a Christian missionary named Father Trilles visited them, learned the Beti language, and wrote a more objective ethnographic account of the Beti people.&lt;ref name="Shoup2011p59"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Patrick Harries|author2=David Maxwell|title=The Spiritual in the Secular: Missionaries and Knowledge about Africa|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dmpyCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT87|year=2012|publisher=Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing|isbn=978-1-4674-3585-7|pages=86–88}}&lt;/ref&gt; More accounts about the Beti people began appearing after World War I, but were often stereotypical and most emphasized about their alleged practice of containing bone relics in [[reliquary]] boxes. These alleged practices were used to justify violence against them and the enslavement of Beti and Fang peoples.&lt;ref name="Gates415"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Anthony Appiah|author2=Henry Louis Gates|title=Encyclopedia of Africa|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=A0XNvklcqbwC |year=2010|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-533770-9|pages=415–419, 460}}&lt;/ref&gt; When their villages were raided, thousands of their wooden idols and villages were burnt by the slave raiders.&lt;ref name="Stokes225"/&gt; The French and the British colonial officials suppressed these practices.&lt;ref name="Shoup2011p59"/&gt;

[[File:Image Tarzan of the Apes poster 1918.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|The Tarzan character (1918) was set among the Beti people of equatorial central Africa.&lt;ref name="Shoup2011p61"/&gt;]]
As scholarship about the Beti people grew in the 1900s, according to John Shoup, the collected evidence suggests that the early rumors and allegations of cannibalism were wrong.&lt;ref name="Shoup2011p59"/&gt; The Beti people were not cannibalistic, the skulls and bones in the open and in the reliquary boxes were actually of their ancestors. The practice of collecting the bones were a way of remembrance and religious reverence for their dead.&lt;ref name="Gates415"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Stokes225"&gt;{{cite book|author=Jamie Stokes|title=Encyclopedia of the Peoples of Africa and the Middle East|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=stl97FdyRswC |year=2009|publisher=Infobase|isbn=978-1-4381-2676-0|pages=225–227}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Shoup2011p60"&gt;{{cite book|author=John A.

===The Tarzan story===
The initial reports of alleged cannibalism attracted widespread attention, supported the oft-stereotyped and presumed African barbarianism, then became a part of fiction and popular literature at the turn of the 20th century. Among the most famous was the novel ''[[Tarzan of the Apes]]'' by [[Edgar Rice Burroughs]], which created the popular [[Tarzan]] character. Burroughs set his novel near the village of Mbonga, among the Beti people and their closely related ethnic group called the [[Fang people]].&lt;ref name="Shoup2011p61"&gt;{{cite book|author=John A. Shoup|title=Ethnic Groups of Africa and the Middle East: An Encyclopedia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SPBfnT_E1mgC&amp;pg=PA60 |year=2011|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=978-1-59884-362-0|pages=60–61}}, Quote: "Such displays of human bones led to rumors of Beti-Pahuin/Fang cannibalism. So common was the belief about their cannibalism and warlike demeanor that the writer Edgar Rice Burroughs decided to set his novel Tarzan in the Beti-Pahuin/Fang area."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Edgar Rice Burroughs|title=Tarzan of the Apes|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZbBOAAAAMAAJ|year=1914|publisher=A. C. McClurg &amp; Company|pages=122–128}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The initial Tarzan story, where infant John is discovered by [[apes]] and raised by a female ape, built on the colonial era stereotype of cannibalistic Africans in the equatorial forests.&lt;ref name="Shoup2011p61"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Berglund2006p80"/&gt; The story, states Shoup, provided a contrast of "pure uncorrupted" noble Tarzan in the midst of a barbaric cannibalistic society. The Tarzan syndicate became a global sensation, was widely followed, created some 89 movies in the 100 years that followed, and launched numerous comic strips and television series, many of which providing a distorted stereotyped view about the people from the African equatorial forest.&lt;ref name="Shoup2011p61"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Berglund2006p80"&gt;{{cite book|author=Jeff Berglund|title=Cannibal Fictions: American Explorations of Colonialism, Race, Gender, and Sexuality|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OuA8H3daLl8C|year=2006|publisher=University of Wisconsin Pres|isbn=978-0-299-21594-1|pages=77–84}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ethnography==
The traditional occupation of the Beti people is farming, particularly of yams, cassava, corn and plantains as staples. Since colonial times, many have adopted cash crops such as peanuts and cacao.&lt;ref name="Gates178"/&gt; They are skilled artists and craftsmen, particularly in iron and wood handicrafts. However, these craftsmanship are nearly extinct because of urbanization and modern trade flows.&lt;ref name="Gates178"/&gt;

The traditional Beti society has been organized at the village level, typically with its borders fenced and fortified with watch towers to protect the inhabitants from wild life of the rain forests and intruders. Outside the village compounds were carefully concealed traps, as another line of defense against slave raiders. The villages have tended to be politically independent of each other, centered on a lineage called ''Ayon'' or ''Mvog''.&lt;ref name="Shoup2011p61"/&gt; They are a patrilineal people, and disputes are typically settled by a due process led by a headman. The Beti revere their ancestors, and known among other things for their artistically produced reliquary boxes called the ''Byeri''. They store the bones of their ancestors in these reliquary boxes, which were used during rites of passage, with their sophisticated masks called ''So'' (animal-faced) and ''Ngil'' (human-faced).&lt;ref name="Shoup2011p61"/&gt;

The Beti people practise double exogamy, that is typically married away from both father's and mother's lineages. Another notable aspect of their society has been the concept of ''Mebala'', a type of [[potlatch]], where wealthy families ceremoniously gather and give away their wealth to the poorer families.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=John A. Shoup|title=Ethnic Groups of Africa and the Middle East: An Encyclopedia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SPBfnT_E1mgC&amp;pg=PA60 |year=2011|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=978-1-59884-362-0|pages=61–62}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''coin of account''' is a unit of [[money]] that does not exist as an actual [[coin]] (that is, a metal disk) but is used in figuring prices or other amounts of money.

===Mill===
The ''[[mill (currency)|mill]]'' (or sometimes, ''mil'') is a coin of account in the United States.  It is equal to one-tenth of a [[penny]], and so to one-thousandth of a dollar (= $0.001), whence the name, which means "thousandth." There was never such a coin [[mint (coin)|mint]]ed by the U.S. Federal government, though some states minted these coins well into the mid-1900s. Coins of account are used in accounting and for figuring [[tax]]es, usually either [[property tax]]es or [[sales tax]]es.

===Guinea===
From 1816 to the 1980s the [[Guinea_(British_coin)#Replacement_by_the_pound|British Guinea]] was no longer used a coin but prices for luxury items and professional services were often quoted in guineas, on the understanding that a guinea was equal to 21 shillings.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18829">'''Allegations of [[Political corruption|corruption]] during the development of [[Suvarnabhumi Airport]]''', the newest international [[airport]] serving [[Bangkok]], [[Thailand]], have been made since the project's inception. These allegations started in the 1970s, when land for the airport was purchased during the dictatorship of [[Thanom Kittikachorn]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://bbs.keyhole.com/ubb/showthreaded.php?Number=196643 New airport, new province, new government HQ?]&lt;/ref&gt; and extended to the government of [[Thaksin Shinawatra]], during which most of the construction occurred. To date, no Thai government, police, or auditor-general investigation has proved any corruption in the project.

''[[The Nation (Thailand)|The Nation]]'', a Thai English-language daily, published several reports alleging corruption in the purchase of x-ray baggage scanning devices for the airport. The resulting scandal delayed the opening of the airport by a year and allowed the opposition [[Democrat Party (Thailand)|Democrat Party]] to initiate a 20-hour no-confidence censure debate that forced Thaksin to remove close supporter Suriya Jungrungreangkit from his position of Transport Minister. The [[Royal Thai Army]] swept into power in a [[2006 Thailand coup|military coup in 2006]], using the allegedly shoddy construction of the airport as one of the justifications for its coup.&lt;ref&gt;International Herald Tribune, [http://www.iht.com/articles/2007/02/02/news/thai.php Thailand's airport imbroglio grows], 2 February 2007&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[CDRM|junta]] initiated several investigations into the airport. The investigative panels found that damage to the airport was "minute" and "common."  The cost of fixing the damage was estimated at less than 1% of the total airport cost. The junta was accused of delaying airport repairs and intensifying the airport's problems in order to pin further blame on the deposed government.

In 2008, ''The Nation'' admitted that its reports of corruption were incorrect, and retracted their stories.&lt;ref name="blog.nationmultimedia.com"&gt;The Nation, [http://blog.nationmultimedia.com/politics/2008/11/06/entry-1 Nation Wrong About Thaksin Corruption] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081210152216/http://blog.nationmultimedia.com/politics/2008/11/06/entry-1 |date=December 10, 2008 }}, 6 November 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
Charges of corruption were levelled against Thai governments since the airport project's inception in the 1970s.  "All the recent previous governments before Thaksin took part in taking something from the project," noted Chaiwat Sinsuwong, a member of the Council of Engineers.&lt;ref&gt;The Nation, [http://nationmultimedia.com/2007/02/11/national/national_30026533.php Engineers beat their breasts over airport debacle] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070212095531/http://www.nationmultimedia.com/2007/02/11/national/national_30026533.php |date=2007-02-12 }}, 11 February 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

Mr Weera Somkuamkit, of the People's Network on Corruption has noted that "Someone got a big payoff just by laying down the sand. There's corruption in every airport project such as the car park, bidding on duty-free shops, cooling system for the buildings and power generating system."&lt;ref name="NewsAsia"&gt;Channel NewsAsia, [http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/southeastasia/view/164606/1/.html Corruption scandals delay Thailand's massive Suvarnabhumi Airport]", 23 August 2005&lt;/ref&gt;  Weera Somkuamkit has not yet made public any evidence supporting his claims. Based on this and other allegations, the opposition parties during the Thaksin government initiated a vote of no confidence against the [[Thaksin Shinawatra|Thaksin-government]]'s transport minister. The censure motion was not successful.

==Car park==
The airport contains 2 5-storey car park buildings with a combined capacity of 5,000 cars.

Two videos were released in which car park contractor [[Latthapol Kesakotin]], in one video, claimed that he paid US$250 million to [[Yaowaret Shinawatra]] (the Prime Minister's sister) to gain a contract to build and operate the airport car park, and another video in which he claimed he didn't pay anything to [[Yaowaret]]. He later publicly denied that he paid anything to Yaowaret.&lt;ref name="NewsAsia" /&gt;

==Bomb detectors==
Twenty-six [[CTX 9000 DSi]] explosive detection x-ray baggage scanning devices were purchased from [[GE]] [[InVision Technologies|Invision]] with a total contract value of US$65 million.&lt;ref&gt;AirportTechnology.com, [http://www.airport-technology.com/projects/bangkok/ Suvarnabhumi Airport] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060813131326/http://www.airport-technology.com/projects/bangkok/ |date=2006-08-13 }}{{Unreliable source?|reason=domain on WP:BLACKLIST|date=June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In response to concerns from the [[International Air Transport Association]] (IATA) that the 26 devices would not be sufficient, the equipment specifications were revised and another 20 devices were acquired. The new specifications also required modification of several other elements of the airport. The CTX 9000 model was selected by the airport primary contractor's design consultant, Cage Inc.&lt;ref&gt;The Nation, "[http://board.nanaplaza.com/showflat.php?Cat=&amp;Number=404973 Suvarnabhumi: Contractor warns over airport delay] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928045018/http://board.nanaplaza.com/showflat.php?Cat=&amp;Number=404973 |date=September 28, 2007 }}", 7 May 2005&lt;/ref&gt;  The choice was also endorsed by New Bangkok International Airport's independent adviser, Quatrotec Inc.

''The Nation'' published reports claiming corruption in the purchase of the CTX bomb scanners.&lt;ref name="NewsAsia" /&gt;  Abhisit Vejjajiva, leader of the opposition [[Democrat Party (Thailand)|Democrat Party]], initiated an unsuccessful [[censure]] debate against Transport Minister [[Suriya Jungrungreangkit]]. The opposition alleged that in November 2004, Suriya had known that Invision was under investigation by the [[US Department of Justice]], and therefore would not be able to provide the bomb scanners on schedule, and despite this knowledge, had approved of payments for the bomb scanners to the airport contractor (the ITO joint venture) and bomb-scanner sub-contractor, Patriot Business Consultants.&lt;ref&gt;Deutsche Presse-Agentur, [http://news.monstersandcritics.com/asiapacific/article_1023252.php/Opposition_grills_Thai_government_over_airport_scandal Opposition grills Thai government over airport scandal] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060427194908/http://news.monstersandcritics.com/asiapacific/article_1023252.php/Opposition_grills_Thai_government_over_airport_scandal |date=April 27, 2006 }}, 25 June 2006&lt;/ref&gt;  The opposition claimed that one billion baht (US$25 million) could have been saved if the bomb scanners were purchased directly from GE InVision rather than going through the two local contractors. The opposition did not win the censure motion, and subsequent investigations cleared [[Suriya Jungrungreangkit]] of any wrongdoing.&lt;ref&gt;The Bangkok Post, [http://www.bangkokpost.net/education/site2005/wnjn1405.htm More To Come] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060508183948/http://www.bangkokpost.net/education/site2005/wnjn1405.htm |date=May 8, 2006 }}, 14 June 2005&lt;/ref&gt;  The scandal delayed the opening of Suvarnabhumi Airport by over a year.

In 2008, ''The Nation'' admitted that its reports of corruption were incorrect.&lt;ref name="blog.nationmultimedia.com"/&gt;

==Suvarnabhumi City==
In October 2005, the government of [[Thaksin Shinawatra]] floated a proposal to combine several districts around Suvarnabhumi Airport into a new province, to be managed as a special administrative zone.&lt;ref&gt;Institute for Public Policy Studies Democracy Monitor, [http://www.fpps.or.th/news.php?detail=n1153847445.news Suvanabhumi Metropolis]&lt;/ref&gt;  These districts would include Samut Prakan's Bang Sao Thong sub-district and Bang Phli district as well as Lat Krabang and Prawet districts of Bangkok. The [[Nakhon Suvarnabhumi Province|new province]] would allow speedier large scale investments in infrastructure by enabling the government to bypass administrative and budgetary constraints for the estimated THB500 billion (US$12.5 billion) in public and private sector. The new zone, to be known as "[[Nakhon Suvarnabhumi Province|Nakhon Suvarnabhumi]]" (Suvarnabhumi City) would cover 521 square kilometres (roughly the size of Singapore) with a population of about 462,000 people. In 2006 the cabinet approved in principle a draft Nakhon Suvarnabhumi Bill prepared by the interior ministry. The Council of State will then review it, followed by a series of public hearings, before the bill is submitted to the House of Representatives.
&lt;!--The proposal was strongly criticized by the Bangkok Metropolitan Administration (BMA), which was dominated by the opposition [[Democrat Party (Thailand)|Democrat Party]]. The BMA claimed that rampant development in the new zone would compromise the capital's flood-prevention system. The BMA also noted that it would lose some THB300 million in taxes from residents and businesses in the two districts.&lt;ref&gt;The Nation, [http://www.nationmultimedia.com/2006/06/22/national/national_30007048.php
Opposition grows to Suvarnabhumi city], 22 June 2006&lt;/ref&gt;--&gt;

There were anonymous allegations that the proposed establishment of the new zone would cause property values to increase, and that government politicians had bought large plots of land in speculation.&lt;ref&gt;The Nation, [http://www.nationmultimedia.com/2006/06/26/business/business_30007280.php City plan could see prices double] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060906163232/http://www.nationmultimedia.com/2006/06/26/business/business_30007280.php |date=2006-09-06 }}, 26 June 2006&lt;/ref&gt;  However, the opening of the airport caused property prices to fall 40-50% in an estimated 4,000 [[Rai (area)|rai]] of land surrounding the airport from 2005 to 2006 due to increased noise levels.&lt;ref&gt;The Nation, [http://www.nationmultimedia.com/2006/10/13/business/business_30016045.php Noise, floods cut land prices] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061030202744/http://www.nationmultimedia.com/2006/10/13/business/business_30016045.php |date=2006-10-30 }}, 14 October 2006&lt;/ref&gt;  An anonymous source had earlier informed ''[[The Nation (Thailand)|The Nation]]'' newspaper that "My friend told me that a politician's wife had bought 4,000 rai from a developer...The transaction was wrapped up in the first quarter of this year &lt;nowiki&gt;[2006]&lt;/nowiki&gt;". The source also noted that prominent developers like Land &amp; Houses, Quality Houses, Property Perfect, Supalai, LPN Develop-ment, SC Asset Corp, as well as the Jungrungreangkit and Mahagitsiri families owned large tranches in the proposed zone. Several developers denied that their ownership of land was related in any way to the proposal and noted that the properties were bought years before.

The plans for Suvarnabhumi City were largely scrapped by post-coup Finance Minister [[Pridiyathorn Devakula]].

==Post-coup Investigations==

===Purging of management===
The [[Royal Thai Army]] [[2006 Thai coup d'état|overthrew]] the Thaksin government in September 2006, using the allegedly shoddy construction of the airport as one of the justifications for its coup.

After the coup, numerous public accusations were made that construction standards of the airport were sub-standard and that cracks were appearing in the runway. Junta leader [[Saprang Kalayanamitr]] forced [[Airports of Thailand|AOT]] President [[Chotisak Asapaviriya]] to resign and also dismissed the directors of [[Suvarnabhumi Airport]] and AOT Commercial Operations.&lt;ref&gt;Bangkok Recorder, [http://www.bangkokrecorder.com/news/news/airport-president-resigns-738.html Airport president resigns] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070206052530/http://www.bangkokrecorder.com/news/news/airport-president-resigns-738.html |date=2007-02-06 }}, 3 February 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;ETNA, [http://etna.mcot.net/query.php?nid=27677 Thailand's new international airport head steps down], 2 February 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

===Junta-led investigations===
A [[CDRM|junta]]-appointed panel of engineers assigned to inspect the airport noted that damage to the airport was "minute," and "common."  This was contrary to public accusations that the airport was seriously damaged after only four months of operation. A spokesman for British Airways also said that "everything is normal," and that "We haven't heard any complaints from the staff."&lt;ref&gt;Bangkok Post, [http://bangkokpost.net/breaking_news/breakingnews.php?id=116510 Suvarnabhumi: No cracks, minor damage] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071010030328/http://bangkokpost.net/breaking_news/breakingnews.php?id=116510 |date=October 10, 2007 }}, 2 February 2007&lt;/ref&gt;  A two-week investigation led by [[Tortrakul Yomnak]], a chief engineer for AOT, found that the runway was safe, and that cracks could be repaired in as little as a few hours. At the beginning of the investigation, Tortrakul had warned that the airport might need to be closed for three years.&lt;ref&gt;Bangkok Post, [http://bangkokpost.net/topstories/topstories.php?id=116749 Suvarnabhumi runway declared safe] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071028221943/http://bangkokpost.net/topstories/topstories.php?id=116749 |date=October 28, 2007 }}, 12 February 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

===AOT-led investigations===
The [[Saprang Kalayanamitr|Assistant Secretary-General]] of the junta was appointed Chairman of the Board at Airports of Thailand. He initiated a comprehensive study of problems at the airport. The completed study showed that the cost of fixing 60 identified problems at the airport would be less than 1% of the total airport cost and that the problems could be fixed in four to five years. Dr. Narupol Chaiyut, a member of a committee overseeing service problems at the new airport, estimated that 70% of the problems would be fixed in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;Bangkok Post, [http://bangkokpost.net/Business/16Feb2007_biz42.php B1bn needed to fix terminal problems over four to five years]{{dead link|date=December 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, 16 February 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

===Engineering Institute of Thailand investigations===
The Engineering Institute of Thailand (EIT) conducted investigations at the airport in late 2006 after signs of distress were spotted at several locations in Suvarnabhumi's taxiways and taxilanes.  [[Rut (roads)|Rutting]] was found in five of the six taxilanes and one of the six taxiways.  [[Plastic deformation]] of the asphalt [[wearing course]] was observed near the takeoff position of the runway. However, the investigators noted that plastic deformation at this location was a common phenomenon and only routine maintenance was required to repair the distress. Aside from this surface distortion, both runways were in good structural condition.

Further investigations found that taxilane and taxiway rutting was caused by separation of the asphalt [[Binder (material)|binder]] from the [[Construction aggregate|aggregate]] surface due to prolonged water infiltration into the asphalt concrete [[base course]], a phenomenon known as "stripping."  The 23&amp;nbsp;cm thick base course is the top-most layer of the tarmac. Core samples indicated that the concrete base course material contained the correct job mix and aggregate gradation. Below the base course are the [[binder course]], and the [[cement-treated base]].

Detailed investigations found that water seepage was evident along the rims of the expansion joints in the cement-tested base, indicating that a large quantity of water was still trapped in the [[sand blanket]] (the bottom-most layer of the tarmac). It was found that water trapped in the sand blanket was fully confined with no connection to the pavement areas of the airport. A later investigation by the AOT identified several potential reasons for the trapped water in the sand blanket. The AOT's findings were disputed by several experts.

The EIT sent a formal warning to AOT in November 2006 about the urgent need to drain water from beneath the tarmac, and the need for immediate action. "The AOT did nothing about the problem," Suebsak Promboon of the EIT noted. "The situation might not have become this bad if the water had been drained then".

In a public statement on 15 February 2007, the EIT again strongly recommended that trapped water should be drained out urgently to minimise the potential spread of cracks. Karun Chandrarangsu, president of EIT, noted, "Suvarnabhumi is like a patient in a coma who continues to suffer from severe bleeding. Stopping the blood flow now is more urgent and important than debating what caused the injury."&lt;ref&gt;The Nation, [http://nationmultimedia.com/2007/02/17/headlines/headlines_30027125.php 'Can we get to work please?'], 17 February 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bangkok Post, [http://pages.citebite.com/t1w2h9p7o4aug Distress in the tarmac], 11 March 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

===Repairs and further criticisms===
Prime Minister [[Surayud Chulanont]] and AOT Chairman General Saprang Kalayanamitr refused to authorize repairs on the airport tarmac. [[Suebsak Promboon]], a senior foundation engineer and a member of the [[Tortrakul Yomnak]]-led airport tarmac inspection panel, accused the AOT of refusing to take action to solve the problems at the airport.&lt;ref&gt;The Nation, [http://www.nationmultimedia.com/2007/02/23/national/national_30027658.php AOT staff stalling urgent repairs: engineer], 23 February 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

Critics noted that junta-led investigations were unlikely to reveal an impartial picture of the airport's shortcomings.  "Problems are normal for any new airport. In our case it's made more complex because everybody wants to run down the former prime minister", noted Sumet Jumsai, a leading Thai architect.&lt;ref&gt;Asian Times Online, [http://www.atimes.com/atimes/Southeast_Asia/IB07Ae01.html Cracks appear in Thai aviation-hub hopes], 7 February 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Leading engineers were sharply divided over the root causes of problems faced by the new airport.&lt;ref&gt;The Nation, [http://nationmultimedia.com/2007/02/10/national/national_30026474.php Engineers unable to agree on root cause of airport cracks] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070212094727/http://www.nationmultimedia.com/2007/02/10/national/national_30026474.php |date=2007-02-12 }}, 10 February 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Hajji]] Din Mohammad''' is a [[politician]], writer and a Pashtun tribal leader in eastern Afghanistan who first served as the [[List of governors of Nangarhar|Governor of Nangarhar Province]] followed by [[List of governors of Nangarhar|Governor of Kabul Province]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nps.edu/programs/ccs/Docs/LeaderProfiles/Hajj_din_Mohammad_Bio.pdf Hajji Din Mohammad Biography]&lt;/ref&gt; He comes from a distinguished [[Pashtun people|Pashtun]] family "Arsala" which has served the Afghan nation for more than 150 years. "Arsala" family is part of the "JabarKhel"(a subtribe of the land-owning Ahmadzai tribe).He is also the elder brother of late [[Abdul Qadir (Afghan leader)|Hajji Abdul Qadir]] and [[Abdul Haq]] His great-grandfather, [[Wazir Arsala Khan]], served as Foreign Minister of Afghanistan in 1869. One of Arsala Khan's descendents, [[Taj Mohammad Khan]], was a general at the [[Battle of Maiwand]]. Another descendent, [[Abdul Jabbar Khan (Afghanistan)|Abdul Jabbar Khan]], was Afghanistan’s first Ambassador to [[Russia]].

==Early life and family background==
Din Mohammad was born in [[Nangarhar]], Afghanistan. His father, [[Amanullah khan]], served as a district administer in various parts of the country. Two of his uncles, [[Mohammad Rafiq Khan]] and [[Haji Zaman Khan]], were members of the 7th session of the Afghan Parliament which worked to expand the rights of ordinary citizens under the monarchy.

Din Mohammad’s brothers [[Abdul Haq (Afghan leader)|Abdul Haq]] and [[Abdul Qadir (Afghan leader)|Hajji Abdul Qadir]] were [[Mujahideen]] commanders who fought against the [[Communism|Communist]] [[Red Army]] during the 1980s [[Soviet war in Afghanistan]]. Din Mohammad served as the deputy of the [[Hezbi Islami]] Party of [[Mohammad Yunus Khalis]].Not Hizb Islami of Hikmatyar.
He served as the Minister of National Security in Afghanistan’s Interim Government in Exile during the 1990s and as Minister of Education in the Mujahideen Government which was established after the collapse of the Communist government. He also served as Deputy Prime Minister in the same period, but resigned when infighting erupted among the rival factions of Ahmad Shah Massoud and Gulbuddin Hekmatyar.

===Governor===
During the Taliban era, Din Mohammad lived in exile and later helped Abdul Haq in his efforts to establish a broad-based post-Taliban government. In 2001, Abdul Haq was captured and executed by the Taliban while pursuing efforts to promote the formation of a broad-based representative government.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rferl.org/content/article/1054592.html Interview: Nangarhar Province Governor On Elections, Drugs, And Security . - Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty]&lt;/ref&gt; Din Mohammad's son Ezatullah Sahil was captured and killed by the Taliban along with Abdul Haq in 2001. Abdul Qadir served as the Governor of Nangarhar Province after the Soviet Occupation and was credited with maintaining peace in the province during the years of civil conflict that followed the Soviet withdrawal. Abdul Qadir served as a Vice President in the newly formed post-Taliban government of [[Hamid Karzai]], but was assassinated by unknown assailants in July 2002. In the same month of 2002, Din Mohammad was selected as the Governor of [[Nangarhar Province]]. in August 2005, he became the Governor of [[Kabul Province]] until August 2009.

Din Mohammad and his brother [[w:Haji Nasrullah Baryalai Arsalai|Hajji Nasrullah Baryalai Arsalai]] remain committed to the principles of inclusive government and reconciliation among competing factions in Afghanistan, and have been active in promoting the economic development and reconstruction of Afghan society after decades of chaos and violence.

'''''Fear of Flying''''' is a 1973 novel by [[Erica Jong]] which became famously controversial for its portrayal of [[female sexuality]] and figured in the development of [[second-wave feminism]].

The novel is written in the first person: narrated by its protagonist, Isadora Zelda White Stollerman Wing, a 29-year-old poet who has published two books of poetry. On a trip to Vienna with her second husband, Isadora decides to indulge her sexual fantasies with another man. Its tone may be considered conversational or informal. The story's American narrator is struggling to find her place in the world of academia, feminist scholarship, and in the literary world as a whole. The narrator is a female author of erotic poetry, which she publishes without fully realizing how much attention she will attract from both critics and writers of alarming fan letters.

The book resonated with women who felt stuck in unfulfilled marriages,&lt;ref name="bbc"/&gt; and it has sold more than 20 million copies worldwide.

=={{anchor|Zipless fuck}}Summary==
Isadora Wing is a Jewish journalist from New York City’s Upper West Side. We meet her on a plane flight to Vienna for the first psychoanalyst’s conference since analysts were driven out during the Holocaust. She is surrounded by analysts, many of them her own from over the years, and her husband Bennett (also an analyst, naturally): "There were 117 psychoanalysts on the Pan Am flight to Vienna and I'd been treated by at least six of them" (page 5).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=|title=Fear of Flying|last=Jong|first=Erica|date=2003-11-04|publisher=Berkley|year=|isbn=9780451209436|edition=Reprint|location=New York|pages=|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her fear of flying, both literally and metaphorically referring to a fear of freeing herself from the shackles of traditional male companionship, she associates with recent articles about plane hijackings and terrorist attacks. She also associates fear and loathing with Germany, her destination, because she and her husband were stationed in Heidelberg and she struggled both to fit in and to wrestle with the hatred and danger she felt being a Jew in post-Holocaust Germany.

Freudians perhaps inevitably have their own ideas about the symbolism of an airplane in the formation of the unconscious and the sexual psyche, and this contrast provides narrative suspense. What did the six psychiatrists make of the narrator's fears? Did she tell them? What will they say in Vienna if she mentions her nervous emotions? These questions are not really explicitly stated, but they may well occur to a reader's mind. The narrator, meanwhile, occupies her mind with many questions, plans, mental rough drafts and reminiscences as her journey unfolds, including the "zipless fuck," a major motif in the story that haunts the narrator throughout.

Upon arriving, Isadora meets English Langian analyst Adrian Goodlove. She is immediately hooked. Despite his gruff attitude and dirty sandals, he seems to provide what she desires but doesn’t find in her own marriage - energy, excitement, desire, danger. They begin a poorly-veiled secret affair, dancing and kissing rather openly at conference events, staying out nights, spending days by German pools. Adrian is wild and awakens things in Isadora she believed to be lost in the everydayness of her marriage, despite the fact that he is a rotten lay and often impotent.{{Quotation|"I refuse to be impaled on a pin," Adrian said, unaware of the pun it immediately brought to mind. "I refuse to be categorized. When you finally do sit down to write about me, you won’t know whether I’m a hero or an antihero, a bastard or a saint. You won’t be able to categorize me." And at that moment, I fell madly in love with him. His limp prick had penetrated where a stiff one would never have reached.|Erica Jong|''Fear of Flying'' (1973), page 126}}

But Isadora’s desperation to feel alive and her developing feelings for Adrian lead her to the toughest decision: to return home with Bennett, or to go to London with Adrian. She agonizes over this decision. One night, Bennett finds Adrian and Isadora in bed together and joins them, in an adventurous sexual act that Bennett never acknowledges afterward.

Finally, through an emotionally taxing and melodramatic letter that she never delivers to Bennett because he once again walks in and interrupts her, Isadora decides to leave with Adrian. The two of them drive through France, Germany, and Italy, camping every night, drinking, and making love. Along the way, Isadora confides in Adrian the stories of her past relationships and first marriage. She reveals that she met her first husband, Brian, in college, where they connected over their mutual love of literature and ability to walk for hours while quoting poetry. This ended when they married, and became a “bourgeois” couple, not seeing each other, not having sex, disconnecting. Brian, a certified genius, begins to fall into delusions, believing himself to be the second coming of Christ. He becomes violent, raping Isadora and choking her close to death in one mental break. He is repeatedly hospitalized and eventually moved to a facility in Los Angeles where Brian blames her for everything and they finally divorce.

Eventually, she decides to return home to Bennett. On a train journey to meet him in London, she is approached by an attendant who sexually assaults her, which propels her into her own psychological self-examination.

{{Quote|text=It wasn’t until I was settled, facing a nice little family group - mother, daddy, baby - that it dawned on me how funny that episode had been. My zipless fuck! My stranger on a train! Here I’d been offered my very own fantasy. The fantasy that had riveted me to the vibrating seat of the train for three years in Heidelberg and instead of turning me on, it had revolted me! Puzzling wasn't it. A tribute to the mysteriousness of the psyche. Or maybe my psyche had begun to change in a way I hadn’t anticipated. There was no longer anything romantic about strangers on trains.|sign=Erica Jong|source=''Fear of Flying'' (1973), page 417}}

She realizes that when she is not in control of her body, when she doesn’t have agency or autonomy, that it doesn’t matter how much she’s dreamed of a situation, it will never be satisfying. When she returns home, she takes a bath, waits for Bennett, and comes to accept her body, herself, and the unknown future: “A nice body. Mine. I decided to keep it” (p 424).

The novel remains a feminist classic and the phrase "zipless fuck" has seen a resurgence in popularity as [[third-wave feminism]] authors and theorists continue to use it while reinterpreting their approach to sexuality and to femininity. [[John Updike]]'s [[The New Yorker|New Yorker]] review is still a helpful starting point for curious onlookers. He commented, "A sexual frankness that belongs to, and hilariously extends the tradition of ''[[The Catcher in the Rye]]'' and ''[[Portnoy's Complaint]]''."

==The Zipless Fuck==
It was in this novel that Erica Jong coined the term "zipless fuck", which soon entered the popular lexicon.&lt;ref name="salon" /&gt; A "zipless fuck" is defined as a sexual encounter for its own sake, without emotional involvement or commitment or any ulterior motive, between two previously unacquainted persons.

{{Quotation|The zipless fuck is absolutely pure. It is free of ulterior motives. There is no power game. The man is not "taking" and the woman is not "giving". No one is attempting to cuckold a husband or humiliate a wife. No one is trying to prove anything or get anything out of anyone. The zipless fuck is the purest thing there is. And it is rarer than the unicorn. And I have never had one.|Erica Jong||''Fear of Flying'' (1973)}}

Jong goes on to explain that it is "zipless" because "when you came together, zippers fell away like rose petals, underwear blew off in one breath like dandelion fluff. For the true ultimate zipless A-1 fuck, it was necessary that you never got to know the man very well."

==Feminist influences then and now==
''Fear of Flying'' was written in the throes of the [[Sexual revolution|Sexual Revolution]] of the 1970s, as associated with [[second-wave feminism]]. Finally it was acknowledged that desire and fantasy are a good thing and not entirely condemnable in women, and Jong wanted to harness that newfound respect for desire into a piece of art that brought the intersections of sexual and nonsexual life together, something she felt was missing in literature. “At the time I wrote ''Fear of Flying'', there was not a book that said women are romantic, women are intellectual, women are sexual—and brought all those things together."&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Open Road Media|title=Erica Jong on Fear of Flying|date=2011-10-14|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwCreMoRt4I|accessdate=2017-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; “What [Isadora is] looking for is how to be a whole human being, a body and a mind, and that is what women were newly aware they needed in 1973.”&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Citation|last=cunytv75|title=One to One: Erica Jong "Fear of Flying" 40th Anniversary|date=2013-10-21|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TfF1X54J9UM|accessdate=2017-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; But she also points out the drawbacks of a sexually liberated life, acknowledging that sexuality “is not the cure for every restlessness.” Male critics who interpreted Isadora as being “promiscuous,” were actually misinterpreting her acts - in reality, she has an active fantasy life but doesn’t in reality sleep with many men.

Jong says that today, women are no longer shocked by the Isadora’s sexuality and the depiction of sex and fantasy as readers were when the book was first released. Instead, she sees that book mirrors the lack of pleasure that many young women experience in sexual interactions. She cites the TV show ''[[Girls (TV series)|Girls]]'' as an example of media that is depicting sexually liberated women but without attention to female pleasure. Just like Isadora, the women on television and alive today struggle to reconcile the empowerment of sexual freedom with the disempowerment of sex without pleasure. However, she also sees growth in the female population that live alone and “whose lives are full with friends, travel, work, everything and who don’t feel that in some way they’re inferior because they don’t have a man at their side” as being one extremely positive result of the way sexual liberation has transformed over the decades.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The political battle over women’s bodies today has also renewed the book’s relevance in Jong’s mind, constituting a 40th anniversary redistribution of the book. “All these states are introducing crazy anti-abortion rules...passing laws that they know are unconstitutional, shutting down Planned Parenthood clinics, and making it very hard...to get birth control.” She cites these types of political moves as a regression from the progress set out by the Sexual Revolution. She also still feels that female authors are “second-class citizens in the publishing world,” as [[Jennifer Weiner]] says in the introduction to the 40th anniversary edition: “it’s very hard, if you write about women and women’s struggles, to be seen as important with a capital ‘I.’”&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Jewishness==
{{POV|date=February 2018}} 
Jewishness appears frequently throughout the book, although it may not stand out as the most eye-catching theme because of how entrenched it is in Isadora’s experience of the world. In particular, her Jewish heritage is invoked through her constant awareness of the history of her people and the trials and tribulations that the Jewish people have gone through not only in recent decades but over the course of their long history. This is a theory that [[Sigmund Freud|Freud]], a frequently referenced figure throughout (and raised as a [[Reform Judaism|Reform Jew]] himself), explored in his work to understand the persecution of Jews. Freud theorized that one of the things that makes Jews who they are, individually and culturally, is a biologically passed down awareness of the Jewish past: “...Jewishness is constituted by the biological inheritance of an archaic memory that Jewish people are inexorably compelled to transmit to future generations, whether consciously or unconsciously.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Slavet|first=Eliza|date=|title=Freud's Theory of Jewishness for Better or for Worse|url=https://divinity.uchicago.edu/sites/default/files/imce/pdfs/webforum/112011/Slavet%20Final.pdf|journal=The Jewish World of Sigmund Freud|volume=|pages=96–111|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Isadora reflects this in her references to the [[The Holocaust|Holocaust]], awareness of the boundaries on her and her family (on one particular visit to her sister in Beirut), among other past traumas.

The role of Isadora’s mother is also an interesting invocation of Jewish stereotypes, in that she defies them in some ways and closely follows them in others. Rather than subscribing to the stereotypical image of a [[Jewish mother|Jewish Mother]] as being overly excessive, nurturing, and giving, Isadora’s mother is rather cold and distant. She does, however, fit the mold of the Jewish Mother stereotype as a martyr and constantly seeking to guilt her children - she tells Isadora repeatedly throughout her childhood that Isadora is the entire reason that she is not a famous artist, as she had to give up her artistic career when she became a mother and could never return to her former glories or passion. This places a distance between mother and daughter.

== Character models ==
Jong has denied that the novel is autobiographical but admits that it has autobiographical elements.&lt;ref name="penguin"/&gt; However, an article in ''[[The New Yorker]]'' recounts that Jong's sister, Suzanna Daou (née Mann), identified herself at a 2008 conference as the reluctant model for Isadora Wing, calling the book "an exposé of my life when I was living in [[Lebanon]]". Daou angrily denounced the book, linking its characters to people in her own life and taking her sister to task for taking cruel liberties with them, especially Daou's husband. In the book, Isadora Wing's sister Randy is married to Pierre, who makes a pass at both Wing and her two other sisters. Jong dismissed her sister's claim, saying instead that "every intelligent family has an insane member".&lt;ref name="newyorker"/&gt;

==Film and radio adaptations==
Many attempts to adapt this property for Hollywood have been made, starting with [[Julia Phillips]], who fantasized that it would be her debut as a director. The deal fell through and Erica Jong litigated, unsuccessfully.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Phillips, Julia | title=You'll Never Eat Lunch in This Town Again | publisher=Random House | year=1991 | isbn=0-394-57574-1 |pages=136 et seq.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In her second novel,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Jong, Erica | title=How to Save Your Own Life | publisher=Tarcher | year=2006 | isbn=1585424994}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jong created the character Britt Goldstein—easily identifiable as Julia Phillips—a predatory and self-absorbed Hollywood producer devoid of both talent and scruples.

In May 2013 it was announced&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last=Fleming, Jr |first=Mike |date=10 May 2013 |title=Erica Jong's ''Fear of Flying'' Getting a Movie after 40 Years in Print |url=http://www.deadline.com/2013/05/before-50-shades-there-was-erica-jongs-fear-of-flying-thats-getting-a-movie-after-40-years-in-print/ |website=[[Deadline Hollywood]] |access-date=1 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; that a screenplay version by Piers Ashworth had been green-lighted by Blue-Sky Media, with [[Laurie Collyer]] directing.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2901">'''Homelessness in the Netherlands''' is a social problem that is quickly on the rise. The increase is a consequence of cuts in welfare.&lt;ref name=nos2090325/&gt;

==Statistics==
In 2015 31,000 people did not have a permanent place to stay, 13,000 more than in 2009 (74% increase over 6 years).&lt;ref name=nos2090325&gt;{{cite web|url=https://nos.nl/artikel/2090325-veel-meer-daklozen-in-nederland.html|title=Veel meer daklozen in Nederland|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The increase of non-Western population was larger, about 100%.&lt;ref name=nos2090325/&gt; Especially among young people homelessness is high. Between January 2015 and 2016 homelessness among people aged 18 through 30 increased from 8,000 to 12,400,&lt;ref name=nos2149786&gt;{{cite web|url=https://nos.nl/artikel/2149786-steeds-meer-jonge-daklozen-in-nederland.html|title=Steeds meer jonge daklozen in Nederland|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; an increase of 55% in just one year.

In international comparison, the proportion of homelessness among legals in the Netherlands (0.19%) is slightly higher than homelessness in the United States (0.18%), slightly lower than in France (0.21%), and lower than in the United Kingdom (0.31%) and Germany (0.35%). Official statistics of homelessness in the Netherlands are collected by [[Statistics Netherlands]] and do not include numbers of homeless illegal immigrants.&lt;ref name=nos2090325/&gt;&lt;!---countries UK, France, and Germany were chosen for proximity. Stats for Belgium was missing. The US was added as often compared used for comparison in homelessness. Please add only Belgium---&gt;

==Housing solutions==
Several organizations in the Netherlands, among which the [[Salvation Army]], offer places to stay for a night.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.legerdesheils.nl/nachtopvang|title=Leger des Heils Nachtopvang voor dak- en thuisloze mensen|website=www.legerdesheils.nl}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reasons that many homeless people do not want to sleep in shelters, sometimes even when it freezes, include high drunkenness among residents, fighting, screaming, sexual harassment, and stealing of personal properties by residents of shelters.&lt;ref name=nrc/&gt;

Homeless sleep in the streets, alleys, under bridges, in fields, dunes, along highways, in forests or illegally enter buildings.&lt;ref name=nrc&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nrc.nl/nieuws/2016/03/11/de-nachtopvang-is-rustig-de-straat-loopt-vol-1597591-a877083|title=De nachtopvang is rustig, de straat loopt vol|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The number of outside dwellers is higher in the summer than in the winter, when additional places are offered in the shelters. It is illegal to sleep without a permit on property that isn't one own's so homeless people regularly get fined.

'''[[Palau]]''' is a transit and destination country for an undetermined, but relatively small, number of women from countries in the Asia-Pacific region who are subjected to [[human trafficking|trafficking]] in persons, specifically [[forced prostitution]] and, to a lesser extent, men from the [[Philippines]], [[China]], and [[Bangladesh]] who are in conditions of [[forced labor]]. Some employers recruit foreign men and women to work in Palau through fraudulent representation of contract terms and conditions of employment. These foreign workers willingly migrate to Palau for jobs in domestic service, [[agriculture]], or construction but are subsequently coerced to work in situations significantly different from what their contracts stipulated{{spaced ndash}}excessive hours without pay, threats of physical or financial harm, confiscation of their travel documents, and the withholding of salary payments are used as tools of coercion to obtain and maintain their compelled service. Some women migrate to Palau expecting to work as waitresses or clerks, but are subsequently forced into prostitution in [[karaoke]] bars and [[massage parlor]]s. Non-citizens are officially excluded from the minimum wage law making them vulnerable to involuntary servitude and debt bondage.&lt;ref name=dos&gt;"Palau". [https://www.state.gov/g/tip/rls/tiprpt/2010/142761.htm ''Trafficking in Persons Report 2010'']. [[U.S. Department of State]] (June 14, 2010). {{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Government of Palau does not fully comply with the minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking; however, it is making significant efforts to do so. Available information suggests that the extent of Palau’s trafficking problem continues to be modest. Although the government began useful actions to address trafficking during the previous reporting period, in the past year{{when |date=June 2015}} it did not make similar efforts to prosecute trafficking offenders, identify victims, ensure victims’ access to appropriate victim services, or educate the public on the dangers of human trafficking.&lt;ref name=dos/&gt; U.S. State Department's [[Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons]] placed the country in [[Trafficking in Persons Report#Ranking System|"Tier 2"]]  in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.state.gov/j/tip/rls/tiprpt/2017/271117.htm|title=Trafficking in Persons Report 2017: Tier Placements|website=www.state.gov|language=en-US|access-date=2017-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prosecution==
The Government of Palau made minimal progress in its anti-human trafficking [[Law enforcement agency|law enforcement]] efforts during the reporting period. Palau’s Anti-Smuggling and Trafficking Act of 2005 prohibits all forms of trafficking in persons, and prescribes sufficiently stringent penalties for these offenses, ranging from 10 to 50 years’ imprisonment and fines up to $500,000; these are commensurate with penalties prescribed for other serious crimes, such as rape. The convictions of four traffickers successfully prosecuted in 2007 were overturned in 2008 and 2009 because the court felt the foreign defendants had been offered insufficient translation services during the trials, and the cases have not yet been re-filed by the government or re-prosecuted, available options under governing Palau laws. These convicted traffickers had forced 15 Filipinas and 9 Chinese waitresses into prostitution, subjecting them to food deprivation, confinement, and illegal salary deductions. Since winning his appeal, one of the traffickers has re-opened the karaoke bar where he had previously exploited trafficking victims.

Allegations of labor recruiters, facilitators, and employers importing foreign trafficking victims to Palau were not investigated, and no labor trafficking offenders were prosecuted or punished. The government did not train law enforcement officers to proactively identify victims or to identify trafficking victims among vulnerable populations, such as foreign women in prostitution.&lt;ref name=dos/&gt;

==Protection==
The Government of Palau offered minimal protective services to victims of trafficking over the reporting period. No long-term protective services were available to victims, and Palauan government agencies did not employ formal procedures to identify and refer trafficking victims to available services. The government did not identify or assist any victims of trafficking during the year, though it has done so in the past. A faith-based organization provided limited assistance to victims of any crime. In the past their services were accessible to trafficking victims and would be made available again, as needed. Palauan authorities did not penalize potential trafficking victims for illegal acts committed as a direct result of being trafficked and has previously encouraged victims to assist in the investigation and prosecution of trafficking offenders. The government did not remove victims to countries where they may face hardship or retribution. In the past, the government did not provide victims with financial assistance, but allowed them to remain in Palau and seek legal employment if they did not wish to return home.&lt;ref name=dos/&gt;

==Prevention==
The government made no discernible efforts to prevent human trafficking through planned campaigns to educate the public about its dangers. The government did not take steps to establish a national anti-trafficking policy, action plan or multi-agency coordination mechanism. Agencies, however, have informally cooperated with each other, with foreign governments, and with international organizations on trafficking matters in the past and continued to do so. In August 2009, the government charged the Chief of the Division of Labor in the Ministry of Commerce and Trade and the Director of the Department of Immigration with alien smuggling, falsification of travel documents, bribery, and misconduct in public office. Although authorities have not yet shown that the cases clearly involved the transnational movement of trafficking victims, the officials were assisting irregular migrants in avoiding standard [[immigration]] procedures; these migrants were from populations which had been identified as trafficking victims in Palau in the past. The government made no discernible efforts to address the demand for commercial sex acts or the demand for forced labor during the reporting period. Palau is not a party to the [[2000 UN TIP Protocol]].&lt;ref name=dos/&gt;

'''Inform Napalm''' is a volunteer initiative to inform Ukrainian citizens and the foreign public about the [[Russian military intervention in Ukraine (2014–present)|undeclared war against Ukraine]], the [[Annexation of Crimea by the Russian Federation|annexation of Crimea]], and the activities of the Russian special services as well as the militants of the so-called "[[Donetsk People's Republic|DPR]]", "[[Luhansk People's Republic|LPR]]", and "[[Novorossiya (confederation)|Novorossiya]]". The team members are engaged in a wide range of other volunteer activities.  In order to inform the foreign audience, authors translate materials to dozens of languages, including [[Japanese language|Japanese]] and [[Chinese language|Chinese]].

The Informnapalm.org website was created in early 2014 after the [[Russian military intervention in Ukraine (2014–present)|Russian military intervention in Ukraine]] and annexation of Crimea. During the existence of the project, volunteers conducted two profound investigations of the [[Malaysia Airlines Flight 17|Boeing-777 crash]] and gathered evidence of the presence of Russian troops in Ukrainian territory.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.day.kiev.ua/uk/article/media/vvichlyva-zbroya|title=Ввічлива зброя|author=Марія Прокопенко|date=September 11, 2015|publisher=[[День (газета)|День]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Top-10 military gadgets involved in the russian aggression against Ukraine.jpg|thumb|413x413px|TOP-10 Military Gadgets Involved in the Russian Aggression Against Ukraine. InformNapalm Infographics]]
The main activities of the project are collecting and analysing [[Open-source intelligence|OSINT]]-information, found in open sources, including social networks.   InformNapalm's investigation of 53rd Artillery Brigade commander colonel Sergei Muchkayev, suspected of killing the [[Malaysia Airlines Flight 17|MH17]] passengers, was used in the report of the [[Eliot Higgins|Bellingcat research team]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=MH17 - Potential Suspects and Witnesses from the 53rd Anti-Aircraft Missile Brigade|url=https://www.bellingcat.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/53rd-report-public.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the [[Russian military intervention in the Syrian Civil War|Russian intervention in Syria]], InformNapalm began publishing personal data of Russian pilots who bombarded Syrian cities, and together with the media project "[[Visuals (project)|Visuals]]" created infographics containing personal data of crew members.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://informnapalm.org/ua/syriya-infografika-ofitsery-vks-rf-vijskovi-zlochyntsi-kremlya/|title=Сирія.

On 23 October 2016, Ukrainian hacker group CyberHunta published correspondence that it alleged was from the office email account of [[Vladislav Surkov]], a political adviser to [[Vladimir Putin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=КИБЕРХУНТА ПЕРЕДАЕТ ПРИВЕТ СУРКОВУ|url=http://cyberhunta.com/news/kiberhunta-peredaet-privet-surkovu/|publisher=Cyberhunta.com|language=Russian|date=23 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Volunteers from Inform Napalm requested additional evidence from an alliance of hacker groups that includes CyberHunta, RUH8, FalconsFlame, and TRINITY. They secured the release of a 1GB Microsoft Outlook data file.

The '''International Year of Shelter for the Homeless''' (IYSH) was recognized in 1987 by the [[United Nations]]. It was first declared, in principle, in UN resolution 36/71&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.un-documents.net/a36r71.htm UN resolution 36/71, 4 december 1981]&lt;/ref&gt; in 1981, and proclaimed officially in 1982 in resolution 37/221.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.un.org/documents/ga/res/37/a37r221.htm Un resolution 37/221], 20 December 1982&lt;/ref&gt; It was mainly aimed at improving [[Shelter (building)|shelter]] / [[housing]] for the poor in general (and not just [[homeless people]]), especially in [[developing countries]]. It was also a follow-up to the [[UN Habitat I|Habitat I]] conference in 1976.

== Actions ==

In several countries, national actions were created, such as [[Australia]] which created an IYSH Secretariat, or the [[United Kingdom]] where a trust was created to collect donations from [[housing associations]] for shelter projects in developing countries, with some projects part-funded by the [[Department for International Development|Overseas Development Administration]]. The trust later evolved into the NGO [[Homeless International]] (now operating as [[Reall]], or Real Equity for All).

== Legacy ==

The [[World Habitat Awards]] were created by the BSHF as their contribution to the IYSH. Two other prizes were created by the Japan Housing Association as awards to deserving housing projects, the '''IYSH Memorial Prize''' in 1988 and the '''IYSH Memorial Encouragement Prize''' in 2006.&lt;ref name="UNCRD"&gt;UNCRD, [http://www.uncrd.or.jp/tr/iysh_prize_award.htm#iysh IYSH Prize]&lt;/ref&gt;

The population of '''Iraqis in Saudi Arabia''' includes Saudi Arabian citizens of Iraqi ancestry as well as Iraqi citizen expatriates living in Saudi Arabia. According to the [[UNHCR]], {{asof|2007|lc=on}}, about 17,000 Arab Shia Iraqis who fled to Saudi Arabia during the [[Iran–Iraq War]] lived in the country with ''de facto'' refugee status; another 33,000 Iraqis fled to Saudi Arabia from U.S.-led attacks, of whom about 5,200 remained in the camp at Rafha.&lt;ref name=IraqisinSaudiarabia/&gt;

The '''Ivatans''' are a [[Ethnic groups in the Philippines|Filipino ethnolinguistic group]] predominant in the islands of [[Batanes]] of the [[Philippines]]. Their ethnogenesis is unclear; their origins remain untraced among scholars, but they are known to be an [[Austronesian peoples|Austronesian group]], related to neighboring [[Ilocano people|Ilocanos]] on purely linguistic basis.

The culture of the Ivatans is partly influenced by the environmental condition of Batanes. Unlike the old-type nipa huts common in the Philippines, Ivatans have adopted their now-famous stone houses made of [[limestone]], designed to protect against the hostile climate.

==Origins==
Documents do not show much about the history of the Ivatans and at present, scholars who study their origins are still unsure as to their exact origin. They question whether the pre-historic Ivatans came from the northern part of [[Luzon]] or southern portions of [[China]] and [[Taiwan]]. There is evidence that they might be a surviving Christianized remnant of a people that once resided on all the islands between Luzon and Taiwan.&lt;ref name="ncip"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ncip.gov.ph/resources/ethno_detail.php?ethnoid=60|title=Ethnic Profile: The Ivatan |work=National Commission on Indigenous Peoples |accessdate=2008-04-07 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080311204203/http://www.ncip.gov.ph/resources/ethno_detail.php?ethnoid=60 |archivedate = March 11, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, they have considered the close racial resemblance of the Ivatans to the [[Malays (ethnic group)|Malays]] and the structure of their language could mean they came from other parts of the Philippines. Tracing their roots through Batanes' folklores, genetic studies of Omoto, a [[Japanese people|Japanese]] anthropologist, of the Yami of Orchid Island (''Lanyu'') show closer genetic affinity of the [[Tao people|Yami]] to the [[Tagalog language|Tagalog]] and [[Visayan languages|Visayan]] and linguistically to the [[Batanic languages|Batanic (Bashiic)]] sub-branch of the [[Malayo-Polynesian languages|Malayo-Polynesian]] branch.&lt;ref name="Datar"&gt;{{Cite web |last=Datar |first=Francisco A. |title=The Batanes Islands |url=http://www.ncca.gov.ph/about_cultarts/comarticles.php?artcl_Id=226 |work=National Commission for Culture and the Arts |accessdate=2008-04-06}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Ivatan Man.jpg|thumb|left|An Ivatan man fresh from work.]]
[[File:Oldest House in Ivatan.jpg|thumb|A ''Sinadumparan'' Ivatan house, one of the oldest structures in the Batanes islands. The house is made of [[limestone]] and [[coral]] and its roofing of [[Imperata cylindrica|cogon grass]].]]
Ivatans already lived in Batanes before the [[Spaniards]] arrived in the Philippines in the 16th century, and lived autonomously long thereafter. On June 26, 1783, Batanes was incorporated to the [[Spanish East Indies]].&lt;ref name="ncip"/&gt; In 1686, Ivatans were forced to settle in the lowlands of Batanes.&lt;ref name="Rowthorn"&gt;{{cite book |last=Rowthorn |first=Chris |title=Philippines |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3XUy3bUTNQsC&amp;pg=PA203&amp;dq=Ivatan+in+Batanes&amp;sig=nc_B11_BqneELDUhNfK6y3StgUA |year=2003 |publisher=Lonely Planet |isbn=1-74059-210-7 |pages=203 |accessdate=2008-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Ivatans were under Spanish rule for 115 years, and gained their independence on September 18, 1898. However, June 6 is celebrated in Batanes as its founding day.&lt;ref name="ncip"/&gt;

==Physical attributes==
One of the earliest accounts of the Ivatan is that of the [[United Kingdom|British]] buccaneer William Dampier in 1687. Dampier described them as "short, squat people; hazel eyes, small yet bigger than Chinese; low foreheads; thick eyebrows; short low noses; white teeth; black thick hair; and very dark, copper-colored skin."&lt;ref name="Datar"/&gt; They also have strong mixture of the short type of the [[Mongol]]s, and there are some individuals who seem to have some physical characteristics peculiar to the Ainus of Japan.&lt;ref name="ncip"/&gt;

==Demographics==
In 1990, population of the Ivatans was 15,026, an increase of 24% over the 1980 population of 12,091. These were distributed to the six municipalities, with 38% residing in [[Basco, Batanes|Basco]], 23% in [[Itbayat, Batanes|Itbayat]], 12% in [[Sabtang, Batanes|Sabtang]], 11% in [[Mahatao, Batanes|Mahatao]] and 8% for [[Uyugan, Batanes|Uyugan]] and [[Ivana, Batanes|Ivana]].&lt;ref name="Datar"/&gt; In the 2000 census, 15,834 Ivatans were among the 16,421 population in Batanes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Population in Batanes Showed an Upward Swing |url=https://www.census.gov.ph/data/pressrelease/2002/pr0285tx.html |work=Philippine National Statistics Office |accessdate=2008-04-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080403060928/http://www.census.gov.ph/data/pressrelease/2002/pr0285tx.html |archivedate=2008-04-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Ivatan Woman.png|thumb|200px|An Ivatan woman wearing a ''vakul'', an [[abaca]] fiber headgear for sunlight and rain protection.]]
The mother tongue of the Ivatans is the ''Chirin nu Ibatan'', but is commonly known as [[Ivatan language|Ivatan]]. A distinct [[Austronesian language]], the Ivatan has two dialects including the ''Basco'', the ''Itbayáten''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Galvez Rubino |first=Carl R. |title=Ilocano Dictionary and Grammar |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qG-zAa_rjoMC |publisher=University of Hawaii |year=2000 |pages=213 |isbn=0-8248-2088-6 |accessdate=2008-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; and possibly the Yami.&lt;ref name="ncip"/&gt; The  Ivatans widely speak and understand the Ilocano, Tagalog, and English languages.&lt;ref name="Datar"/&gt;

Today, most Ivatans are [[Roman Catholicism in the Philippines|Catholics]], like the rest of the country, although some have not converted practice [[ancestral worship]] to their ''[[anito]]s''.&lt;ref name="ncip"/&gt; However, there are growing [[Protestantism in the Philippines|Protestant]] denominations specially in the capital town of Batanes.&lt;ref name="Datar"/&gt;

==Culture==
The Ivatan's culture have been largely influenced by the climate of Batanes. Exposed to high risks of disruption to their agriculture, Ivatans have adopted strategies to live.

Traditionally, because of frequent typhoons and drought, they plant root crops able to cope with the environment. These crops include yam, sweet potato, taro, garlic, ginger and onion, as they ensure higher chances of survival during awry climate conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Bankoff |first=Greg |title=Cultures of Disaster: Society and Natural Hazards in the Philippines |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5O8qU49LIzQC&amp;pg=PA165&amp;dq=Ivatan+in+Batanes&amp;lr=&amp;sig=8Rgyweq_laVasqJUjeeaWGQ9BYg |year=2002 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=0-7007-1761-7 |pages=165 |accessdate=2008-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Ivatan study the behavior of animals, sky color, wind and clouds to predict the weather. Ivatans usually gather their animals and stay in their houses when they see that the cows take shelter from the ''payaman'' (communal pasture) and birds taking refuge in houses or in the ground. A pink sky with an orange hue also heralds a storm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/inquirerheadlines/nation/view/20080629-145400/Ivatan-of-Batanes-share-secrets-of-survival-in-typhoon-belt|title=Ivatan of Batanes share secrets of survival in typhoon belt|last=Trinidad-Echavez|first=Andrea|date=2008-06-29|publisher=[[Philippine Daily Inquirer]]|accessdate=2008-07-01|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080629232325/http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/inquirerheadlines/nation/view/20080629-145400/Ivatan-of-Batanes-share-secrets-of-survival-in-typhoon-belt|archivedate=2008-06-29|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The sea is vital to the Ivatan's way of life.&lt;ref name="Rowthorn"/&gt; Although abundant only in the month of March to May, they depend on the flying fish (dibang) and dolphinfish (arayu) present on the shores of Batanes.&lt;ref name="Datar"/&gt; They have a native delicacy called ''uvod'' (the pith of the banana stalk) which is served, along with the wine ''palek'', on festive occasions such as weddings.&lt;ref name="ncip"/&gt;

Before Spaniards arrived at the Philippines, Ivatans built their houses largely from [[Imperata cylindrica|cogon grass]], small and well-situated, designed to protect against strong winds.&lt;ref name="Datar"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Rowthorn"/&gt; The Spaniards introduced large-scale production of lime for the construction of their now-famous stone houses. With meter-thick [[limestone]] walls,&lt;ref name="Rowthorn"/&gt; the type of their infrastructures are designed against the harsh Batanes environment,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Brown |first=Jessica|title=The Protected Landscape Approach: Linking Nature, Culture and Community |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=By2ynKov1LYC&amp;pg=PA103&amp;dq=Ivatan+in+Batanes&amp;sig=6pNAD7zgrxkyAiMftwhn1emCP1c#PPA103,M1 |year=2005 |publisher=The World Conservation Union |isbn=2-8317-0797-8 |pages=103 |accessdate=2008-04-06|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is known as a terminal passage of typhoons in the Philippines. The basic cogon grass is still preserved as roofs of their houses, thickly constructed to withstand strong winds.&lt;ref name="Datar"/&gt; These houses are comparable to the white houses in New Zealand, Ireland and Scottish Highlands.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last=Calubiran |first=Maricar |title=Ivatan joins Dinagyang to promote Batanes tourism |url=http://www.thenewstoday.info/2008/01/16/ivatan.joins.dinagyang.to.promote.batanes.tourism.html |work=The News Today |accessdate=2008-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the endemic clothing of the Ivatans is the ''vakul''. A ''vakul'' is a headgear designed to protect the wearer from sun and rain. It is made from abaca fiber of the ''[[Arecaceae|vuyavuy]]'' palm.&lt;ref name="Rowthorn"/&gt;

The Ivatan have three folk songs styles: the ''laji'', the ''kanta'' and the ''kalusan''.&lt;ref name="Datar"/&gt; The ''laji'' are ancient lyrical songs that are supposed to be sung when they are merry or just finished work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Quindoza-Santiago |first=Lilia |url=http://www.ncca.gov.ph/about_cultarts/ebook_subcont.php?subcont_Id=23|title=Early Philippine Literature |work=National Commission for Culture and the Arts |year=2002 |accessdate=2008-04-07 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080121071243/http://www.ncca.gov.ph/about_cultarts/ebook_subcont.php?subcont_Id=23 |archivedate = January 21, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''kalusan'' is sung during work.&lt;ref name="Datar"/&gt;

'''''Karl Marx's Theory of Revolution''''' is a 5-volume work (1977–1990) about [[Karl Marx]] by [[Hal Draper]].

==Reception==
The economist [[Robert Heilbroner]] praised ''Karl Marx's Theory of Revolution'' as an "extraordinarily stimulating work written in a fresh, open style which comes as a welcome relief after the turgidities of so much Marxist writing."&lt;ref&gt;[[#Fli90|Flint 1990]].&lt;/ref&gt; The political scientist [[David McLellan (political scientist)|David McLellan]] described it as a "splendidly detailed discussion aiming to show that Marx was always right."&lt;ref&gt;[[#McL95|McLellan 1995]]. p. 441.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8158">'''Kin-Yip Chun''' is a Canadian geophysicist at the [[University of Toronto]]'s Department of [[Physics]]. He gained attention when he sued his university for alleged [[racial discrimination]].

==Academic career==
Chun received a [[Bachelor of Applied Science]] degree in [[Engineering Science]] from the [[University of Toronto]], an [[Master of Arts|M.A.]] in Geophysics at [[Columbia University]] and a [[Ph.D.]] at [[University of California, Berkeley|Berkeley]]. He joined the [[University of Toronto]] as a research associate in 1985. His research was in seismology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.utoronto.ca/acc/chun/document/chuncv.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2001-11-23 |deadurl=no |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20011123180431/http://www.utoronto.ca/acc/chun/document/chuncv.htm |archivedate=2001-11-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chun was allegedly promised a [[tenure]]-track position with the department when he accepted. His duties matched or exceeded the senior professors of the department. Chun brought in $1.4 million in research grants, had 26 research publications in international journals, represented [[Canada]] at a [[United Nations]] conference, supervising [[Graduate school|graduate students]], and [[lecture|teaching classes]].

As a [[research associate]], he was not on the university's [[payroll]]. He depended upon research grants to fund his work and cover his living expenses as well. Chun remained a research associate for ten years, while being passed over for tenure four times. One time, when he applied, the other candidates were given a month to prepare for the presentation, while he was only given a few days. In another instance, Chris Chapman was selected over him but only stayed for a short time before leaving for the private sector, while the position was eliminated after his departure, leading to allegations that Chapman was given the job in order to preempt Chun from getting it. Up to 1992, as ''Full Member of the Graduate Faculty'', Chun held the responsibilities of a professor, as he supervised graduate students and taught lectures, but not the pay and benefits that accompany such a position.

In 1994, Chun complained to the [[Dean (education)|Dean]] of Arts &amp; Sciences, stating that he would commit suicide if the search process continued to be unfair, and his suicide threat would later be frequently used against him although Dr Chun maintained that his statement was clear hyperbole.

==The Dr. Chun Case==
Chun's dismissal soon drew nationwide media attention to his plight. He was supported by many student groups and the [[Ontario New Democratic Party|Ontario NDP]] leader [[Howard Hampton]]. In June 1995, the Canadian Association of University Teachers (CAUT) sent two members of the Academic Freedom and Tenure (AF&amp;T) Committee to the University of Toronto to investigate, and their report suggested a pattern of systematic discrimination. The AF&amp;T also made several recommendations, including allowing Chun to return to the university with a salary and job security, and holding a fair competition for a tenured position in the faculty. The [[Ontario Human Rights Commission]] backed Chun's complaint, stating that racism was a factor in stopping him from obtaining a full-time position, describing the Physics Department as a "poisoned work environment", "cronyism", "the dynamic of an 'old boys' network" operating in all four job competitions, and "a series of reprisals culminating in his dismissal".

The University however refused to acknowledge the AF&amp;T report and its recommendations, and tried to have the OHRC dismiss the case. The case dragged on for years. Back in 1994, the University's own appointed investigator for the case, Dr. Cecil Yip, stated that Dr. Chun "acted and has been treated like a professoriate in spite of the fact he has derived his salary support entirely from his own external research contracts. And he has served the Department and the University well in this capacity." Further, "it is certainly justified for Dr. Chun to feel&amp;nbsp;... he is being penalized for good performance", and concluded, "In my judgment Dr. Chun has been exploited by the Department." Overall, the ''Yip Report'' concluded that Chun had been exploited, though it found no evidence that he had been a victim of racism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.utoronto.ca/acc/chun/backgrnd.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2001-11-23 |deadurl=no |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20011123174817/http://www.utoronto.ca/acc/chun/backgrnd.htm |archivedate=2001-11-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1998, Chun launched a $1-million lawsuit against the University for unjust dismissal.

==Settlement and Aftermath==
By the time the controversy had ended, President [[Robert Prichard]] had departed and he had been succeeded by [[Robert Birgeneau]]. A mediated settlement was reached in 2000 and Chun dropped his appeal against the Ontario Human Rights Commission, as well as his $1-million lawsuit against the University.  In return, Chun received a full-time faculty position of Research Scientist and [[University Professor#North American|Adjunct Professor]], $100,000 in compensation, an estimated $150,000 in legal fees and a $260,000 research start-up fund.

A column by Margaret Wente of ''[[The Globe and Mail]]'' which attacked the settlement received severe criticism from many students and faculty.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.safs.ca/issuescases/uta.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.safs.ca/issuescases/wente.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The Arts &amp; Science Students' Union (ASSU), which represents more than 22,000 full-time undergraduate students at the University of Toronto described the incident as the "Dr. Chun miscarriage of justice" when bringing up the controversies of Prichard's administration, on the back of their 2001 Arts and Sciences Anti-Calendar.

In 2003, the Canadian Association of University Teachers (CAUT) established a committee to study Dr. Chun's case. They concluded there were "serious irregularities" in the hiring process in each case and that Dr. Chun was treated unfairly. They discovered when he had made allegations of systemic discrimination, he was subject to various forms of harassment and unfair treatment, such as being prevented from attending departmental meetings, denied a faculty library card, frustrated from pursuing his research, and prohibited from teaching courses. The inquiry described this as a serious violation of academic freedom.

'''Kobon''' (pronounced ''Kxombon)'' is a language of [[Papua New Guinea]]. It has somewhere around 90–120 verbs{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}}.

Kobon has a [[Pandanus language]], spoken when harvesting [[karuka]].&lt;ref name="Pawley"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Pawley |first1=Andrew |authorlink1=Andrew Pawley |editor1-last=Dutton |editor1-first=Tom E. |editor2-last=Ross |editor2-first=Malcolm |editor3-last=Tryon |editor3-first=Darrell |editor2-link=Malcolm Ross (linguist) |editor3-link=Darrell Tryon |title=The Language Game:  Papers in Memory of Donald C.

Laycock]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geographic distribution==
Kobon is spoken in [[Madang Province]] and [[Western Highlands Province]], north of [[Mount Hagen]].

==Sounds==
===Vowels===
Monophthongal vowels are {{IPA|/i e ɨ ə a o u/}}, diphthongs are {{IPA|/ai̯ au̯/}}. {{IPA|/i/}} and {{IPA|/u/}} may be {{IPA|[jɪ]}} and {{IPA|[wʊ~ʍʊ]}} word-initially. {{IPA|/ɨ/}} ({{IPA|[ɨ~ɯ]}}) is written {{angle bracket|ü}} and {{IPA|/ə/}} ({{IPA|[ɜ~ɘ~ɪ]}}) is written {{angle bracket|ö}}.

Only {{IPA|/i a u/}} and the diphthongs occur word-initially, apart from the quotative particle, which is variably /a~e~o~ö/. {{IPA|/e o/}} occur syllable-initially within a word. All vowels (including the diphthongs) occur syllable-medially (in CVC syllables), syllable-finally and at the ends of words. Many vowel sequences occur, including some with identical vowels.

===Consonants===
Kobon distinguishes an [[alveolar lateral]] {{IPA|/l/}}, a [[palatal lateral]] {{IPA|/ʎ/}}, a subapical [[retroflex lateral flap]] {{IPA|/{{PUA|&amp;#xf269;}}&amp;thinsp;/}} ({{IPA|ɭ̆}}&amp;thinsp;), and a [[Alveolar trill#Voiced alveolar raised non-sonorant trill|fricative trill]] {{IPA|/r̝/}}, though the frication on the latter is variable.

|}

Voiced obstruents may be prenasalized after vowels, depending on the preceding consonant, and are voiceless word-initially. Liquids other than {{IPA|/ʎ/}} tend toward [[final devoicing]]. For example, final {{IPA|/d/}} is {{IPA|[ntʰ]}} and final {{IPA|/l/}} tends to {{IPA|[ɬ]}}. ({{IPA|/w/}} and {{IPA|/j/}} do not occur in final position, while nasals and {{IPA|/ʎ/}} retain voicing.) Voiceless consonants other than {{IPA|/s/}} and {{IPA|/h/}} are optionally voiced between vowels.

{{angle bracket|ƚ}} is sublaminal retroflex. It has been described as a lateral flap, {{IPA|{{PUA|[[Retroflex lateral flap|[&amp;#xf269;]]]}}}}.

All consonants occur syllable initially, though {{IPA|/ŋ/}} only occurs word-initially in a single mimetic word. All consonants but {{IPA|/h j w/}} occur syllable- and word-finally. Clusters occur in many (C)VC.CV(C) words, as well as initially in a handful of mostly monosyllabic CCV(C) words. Attested initial clusters are {{IPA|/bɽ, xɽ, fr, xl/}}.

Intervocalically, the lenis obstruents are oral {{IPA|[b d dʑ ɡ~ɣ]}} when a nasal or another lenis obstruent occurs in the preceding syllable, and are prenasalized {{IPA|[mb nd ɲdʑ ŋɡ]}} otherwise, with some variability after {{IPA|/h/}}. They are often oral in a medial cluster after another consonant. Otherwise the allophones in the table above are largely in [[free variation]].

==Grammar==
Kobon is a [[subject–object–verb]] language.

Singular, [[dual (grammatical number)|dual]], and plural are distinguished in [[personal pronoun]]s and [[kinship terminology]].

Like the other Kalam languages, Kobon is famous for having a very small number of [[verb]]s—perhaps less than 120 for the entire language{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}}. These verbs are combined with [[noun]]s into [[verb phrase|phrases]] with specific meanings, much as one says "have dinner" rather than "dine" in English.

This makes for an interesting window into [[semantics]]. One might expect that with a very limited set of verbs, their meanings would be quite general as ''have, do, be'' and ''go'' are in English. To a certain extent this is really the case, as there is for example only one verb of [[perception]]. That is, the same verb is used for ''see, hear, taste, smell, feel'' (both physically and emotionally), ''think,'' and ''understand'' (compare with "I see" for "I understand" in English). Another verb is used for making sound, whether it's speaking, singing, praying, crying, twigs breaking, rocks clattering, or water gurgling. However, some Kobon verbs are quite specific. There is one exception for ''sound,'' for example: there's a specific verb for calling a pig. There are also three verbs of ''pouring,'' depending on whether the thing being poured is solid, liquid, or food; and there is even a verb that means ''to quarter a [[cassowary]].''

{{Expand section|date=December 2009}}

==Writing system==
Kobon has been written in the [[Latin alphabet]] for over 30 years. The special letters [[L with bar|ƚ]] and [[L with middle tilde|ɫ]] are used for the subapical [[retroflex lateral flap]] and [[palatal lateral approximant|palatal lateral]], respectively.

:''a b c d e g h i j k l ƚ ɫ m n ñ ŋ o ö p r s u ü w y''

5&amp;ndash;15% of Kobon speakers are literate.

'''Kongu Vellalars''', sometimes referred to simply as [[Gounder (title)|Gounder]], are a community from the western region of [[Tamil Nadu]], which is known as [[Kongu Nadu]]. It  also refers to the title or surname used by the [[Vellalar]] community from the region. Kongu Vellala Gounders were classified as a [[Forward Caste]] at the time of [[Partition of India|Indian independence]] but they successfully requested to be reclassified as a [[Backward Class]] in 1975.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/article277921.ece | newspaper=The Hindu | title=Looking to create a Kongu stronghold | date=8 May 2009 | first=K.V. | last=Prasad | accessdate=22 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Vellalars of Kongu region came to be known as Kongu Vellalar or Gounder, though both the names have also been treated separately in some regions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Historical Dictionary of the Tamils|first=Vijaya |last=Ramaswamy |page=303 |publisher=Scarecrow Press |year=2007 |isbn=9780810864450 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=H4q0DHGMcjEC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This is a list of Mexican states by their respective homicide data.

== Methodology ==

The [[Instituto Nacional de Estadística y Geografía|National Institute of Statistic and Geography]] released information of homicides for the [[States of Mexico|31 federal states]] and the [[Mexican Federal District|Federal District]] of [[Mexico]]. In the year 2011 there were 27,199 homicides in [[Mexico]]. The state of [[Chihuahua (state)|Chihuahua]] ranked number one with the most homicides in the country, the least was [[Baja California Sur]]. For Mexico there were 24 homicides for every 100,000 inhabitants.

'''London Sake Challenge (LSC)''', established in 2012 by the [[Sake sommelier association|Sake Sommelier Association]] and its founders Xavier Chapelou and Kumiko Ohta, is an annual [[sake]] competition held at [[Harrods]], and is the first competition of its kind.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The 2012 London Sake Challenge|url=http://jytk.wordpress.com/2012/10/06/the-2012-london-sake-challenge/|newspaper=Roadside Hut of the Jui "Young"|date=6 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Products submitted from [[breweries]] all over [[Japan]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Sommeliers Match Sake with Truffles and Foie Gras|url=http://www.wine-searcher.com/m/2012/09/sommeliers-match-sake-with-foie-gras|newspaper=Wine-searcher|date=27 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  are evaluated by sake sommeliers from around the world and judged by taste, quality, labelling and packaging. The first competition took place on 20 August 2012, during [[London 2012|2012 London Olympic Games]].

== Objective ==
The purpose of the event is to recognise outstanding premium sakes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Sam|title=London Sake Challenge|url=http://www.esdmagazine.com/london-sake-challenge/|newspaper=Eat Sleep Drink Magazine|date=18 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It aims to promote the consumption of sake by highlighting a new market where sake is matched with non-[[oriental]] food. It also seeks to increase public awareness and fashionability of the drink in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Joe|first=Warwick|title=Sake Sommelier Association launches London Sake Challenge|url=http://www.harpers.co.uk/sommelier/sommeliers-news/12324-sake-sommelier-association-launches-london-sake-challenge.html|newspaper=Harpers|date=7 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Melinda|first=Joe|title=Looking to bring Japan’s tastes to new markets through sake|url=http://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2013/01/23/national/looking-to-bring-japans-tastes-to-new-markets-through-sake/#.UUHnDXNgqTw|newspaper=The Japan Times|date=23 Jan 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Judging Process ==
Every sake is assessed independently, not comparatively. Sake sommeliers and jury members evaluate each sake by scoring appearance, flavour and taste in the first round of blind tasting. Labelling and packaging are assessed separately in the second round. Sake sommeliers score sakes from 0 to 5 stars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=London Sake Challenge|url=http://londonsakechallenge.com/judge-en.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reward ==
The competition awards gold, silver and bronze medals to the highest scoring sakes in accordance with the judging criteria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Experts in U.K. push rice wine in Europe|url=http://aws.japantimes.co.jp/news/2012/08/29/news/experts-in-u-k-push-rice-wine-in-europe/#.UQfu1nNgqTw|newspaper=The Japan Times|date=29 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Marital breakdown''' refers to the common process whereby the [[interpersonal relationship|relationship]] between a [[marriage|married couple]] erodes, such that they cannot ordinarily restore their relationship.  There are many stages to the process, and each individual goes through the stages at different rates.  It is a complex process involving [[psychology]], [[personal finance]], and often [[religion]]. It is the breach of domestic anticipation, often leading to a divorce or dissolution of the marital relationship.  Often there are children, in-laws, and other individuals involved in the process.  At the end of the process, there may be no relationship left, or there may be a long-term relationship at a distance. (see [[legal separation]])  Every marital breakdown is different in this regard.

There are many reasons why some marriages last and others breakdown. The famous 1989 movie [[The War of the Roses (film)|The War of the Roses]] depicts an extremely violent marital breakdown, where two otherwise reasonable people breakdown into violent fits of anger directed at one another.  Such violence often requires immediate legal intervention to keep individuals from harming one another.  In most States, a [[domestic violence]] [[restraining order]] (also sometimes called an Order of Protection) is routinely granted when one domestic partner proves that the other has caused violence.

Not all marital breakdowns necessarily result in a [[divorce]].  Not all divorces result from marital breakdowns, though the courts ordinarily require one of the parties to attest on penalty of perjury that such a breakdown has occurred before a divorce can be granted.

In [[Hausa people|Hausa]] culture, divorce refers to the wife receiving an agreement that the husband has rejected the marriage; she is expected to return to her father's house.

'''Matlatzinca'''{{Pronunciation-needed}} is a name used to refer to different [[Indigenous peoples in Mexico|indigenous ethnic groups]] in the [[Toluca Valley]] in the [[México (state)|state of México]], located in the central highlands of [[Mexico]]. The term is applied to the ethnic group inhabiting the valley of Toluca and to their language, [[Matlatzinca language|Matlatzinca]].
 
When used as an [[ethnonym]], Matlatzinca refers to the people of Matlatzinco. ''Matlatzinco'' was the Aztec (Nahuatl) term for the Toluca Valley. The political capital of the valley was also referred to as “Matlatzinco;” this was a large city whose ruins are today known as the archaeological site of [[Calixtlahuaca]]. In Prehispanic times the Toluca Valley was the home to speakers of at least four languages: [[Otomi language|Otomi]], [[Matlatzinca language|Matlatzinca]], [[Mazahua language|Mazahua]], and [[Nahuatl language|Nahuatl]]. Thus speakers of any of these languages could be called “Matlatzinca” if they resided in the Toluca Valley. When the Aztec native historical sources or the Spanish chroniclers refer to “the Matlatzinca” it is often not clear where they mean speakers of the Matlatzinca language, the peoples of the Toluca Valley, or even the inhabitants of Calixtlahuaca.

==Language==
{{main|Matlatzinca language}}
The Matlatzinca language is part of the [[Oto-Pamean languages|Oto-Pamean]] subgroup of the [[Oto-Manguean languages|Oto-Manguean]] language family, which also includes [[Otomi language|Otomi]], [[Mazahua language|Mazahua]], [[Pame language|Pame]] and [[Chichimeca Jonaz language|Chichimeca Jonaz]]. Linguistically the term “Matlatzinca” refers to speakers of the Matlatzinca language. In ancient, historical and modern times, the Matlatzinca language was spoken in the Toluca Valley of central Mexico, west of the Valley of Mexico. The Matlatzinca language has two subgroups or dialects that are mutually unintelligible: one called Ocuiltec or Tlahuica and Matlatzinca proper. While originally one language they are now so removed that they are often considered separate languages. Matlatzinca is severely endangered and now only spoken by around 100, mostly elderly people in San Francisco Oxtotilpa and Ocuiltec/Tlahuica spoken by between 50-100 in Ocuilan municipio in the villages San Juan Atzingo and Santa Lucía del Progreso.

PART 61--CERTIFICATION: PILOTS, FLIGHT INSTRUCTORS, AND GROUND INSTRUCTORS&lt;/ref&gt;  Each certificate must be issued by a doctor approved by the [[Federal Aviation Administration]] to a person of stable physical and mental health.

==Types==
The three kinds are:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ecfr.gpoaccess.gov/cgi/t/text/text-idx?c=ecfr&amp;sid=c25ddaf911e70c5633e7cf502aef7794&amp;rgn=div8&amp;view=text&amp;node=14:2.0.1.1.2.1.1.17&amp;idno=14 |title=Federal Aviation Regulations 61.23(d)|accessdate=2009-09-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*''[[Pilot certification in the United States#Third class|Third Class]] Medical Certificate'':  necessary to exercise the privileges of a [[Private Pilot License|Private pilot license]] or [[Pilot certification in the United States#Private pilot|certificate]], or any lower pilot certification level except for the FAA's [[Pilot certification in the United States#Sport pilot|Sport pilot certificate]] (which only requires the same medical clearance required to drive a car, as evidenced by a valid driver license). In the United States, a third-class medical expires after 60 calendar months for someone under the age of forty years (as of the date of examination), or 24 calendar months for someone over forty.
*''[[Pilot certification in the United States#Second class|Second Class]] Medical Certificate'':  necessary to exercise the privileges of a [[Commercial Pilot License|Commercial pilot license]] or [[Pilot certification in the United States#Commercial|certificate]]. In the United States, it expires after 12 calendar months regardless of pilot age.
*''[[Pilot certification in the United States#First class|First Class]] Medical Certificate'':  necessary to exercise the privileges of an [[Airline Transport Pilot License|airline transport pilot license]] or [[Pilot certification in the United States#Airline transport pilot|certificate]]. In the United States, it expires after 12 calendar months for a pilot under 40, 6 months for pilots over 40.

Medical certificates higher than the minimum requirement for a pilot license level still allow the holder to exercise the privileges at that level, even after the initial class of medical certification has expired. For instance, a pilot holding a valid first-class medical certificate may operate a plane with the privilege level of a private or commercial pilot. These privileges may be exercised until the date that a medical certificate of the minimum required class would expire; 9 months after issuance of a first-class medical, a pilot over 40 could still use the certificate to operate as a commercial or private/recreational pilot, and could still operate as a private or recreational pilot up to 2 years after issuance.

==Flight physicals==
Military and civilian pilots must pass routine periodic medical examinations known informally as "flight physicals" in order to retain the medical clearance or certification that qualifies them to fly.  Military pilots go to a [[flight surgeon]], an armed forces physician qualified to perform such medical evaluations.  With the exception of glider pilots, balloon pilots and sport pilots, civilian pilots in the United States and most other nations must obtain a flight physical from a civilian physician known as an [[Aviation Medical Examiner]] (AME).  AMEs are physicians designated and trained by the [[FAA]] to screen individuals for fitness to perform aviation duties.  Pilot medical assessment by way of the flight physical is an important [[public health]] function.

Flying has the potential for serious consequences if not done properly and carefully. Just as it would be unwise to fly in an aircraft that is not airworthy, it is unsafe to fly as, or with, a pilot who is medically compromised. Annual inspections are performed on all aircraft to assure that they meet minimum safety standards. Routine medical exams accomplish the same goal for pilots. When an aircraft successfully completes an annual inspection, the inspector endorses in the logbooks to signify the aircraft is airworthy. Similarly, when a pilot successfully passes the flight physical, the physician endorses the Airmen Medical Certificate which the pilot then carries when performing flight duties. This is then evidence that the pilot has met the medical standards for aircraft operation.

=== Types of flight physicals ===
{{outdated|date=November 2016}}
[[Federal Aviation Regulations]] in the U.S. require pilots and air traffic controllers to have periodic flight physicals in order to perform their aviation related duties.  Authority for these laws comes from the CFR (Code of Federal Regulations) parts 61 and 67.  Federal regulations describe three classes of medical certificates: Class 3 medical certificates are for [[private pilot]] duties only. They have the least restrictive medical requirements and the certificates are good for 5 years for applicants under age 40 and 2 years for those 40 and over. Class 2 medical certificates are for commercial, non-airline duties as well as private pilot duties. This certificate would be required of crop dusters, charter pilots, corporate pilots, and anyone else who flies commercially. The certificate is good for 1 year for commercial activities and 2 or 5 years for private pilot use based on age. Class 1 medical certificates are required for airline transport pilots who fly scheduled airliners. These are the most complex examinations and include electrocardiograms (EKGs). EKGs are required at the first Class 1 medical after the applicant turns 35 and then the first medical after age 40 and yearly thereafter.  Class 1 certificates are good for airliner duties for 1 year for applicants under age 40 and 6 months for those 40 and over. Like the Class 2 certificate, however, these remain good for a full year for other commercial activities and 2 or 5 years for private pilot duties.  Detailed medical requirements for each class of pilot exam are described in [http://flightphysical.com/part67/index.htm Code of Federal Regulations Part 67].

A newer pilot classification in the United States does not require a formal flight physical.  A pilot can fly a light sport aircraft if they hold a sport pilot certificate or a recreational pilot certificate and have a U.S. driver' license from any state.  Pilots with neither a driver's license nor an Airmen Medical Certificate can still fly, but aviation duties are restricted to non-commercial activities in a glider or a balloon.  The pilot must self-endorse and certify that he/she has no known medical deficiencies which would render them incapable of piloting an aircraft. Sport pilot medical requirements are described in detail in [http://flightphysical.com/part67/61.303-Sport-Pilots.htm CFR 61.303].

== Denial of medical certification ==
Depending upon which Class certificate a pilot wants or needs, it is possible that either the [[Aviation Medical Examiner]] or the [[Federal Aviation Administration|FAA]] may deny a pilot's medical certificate. This may be due to recent surgery, medication taken, non-aviation-related offenses (such as drunk driving citations), or any other medical condition. Pilots may appeal denials up to and including formal appeals to the [[National Transportation Safety Board]]. The process of making an appeal includes meticulous documentation of a pilot's medical condition, therapies involved in treatment, and may be accompanied by psychological evaluations and/or other data. While any pilot may successfully make and receive approval via appeals, there are professional organizations that exist to aid pilots in appealing the denial of a medical certificate.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1744">The '''Metyktire''' are a subgroup of the [[Kayapo]] people of [[Brazil]]. They live on the [[Menkregnoti]] reservation in the [[Amazon River]] basin.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/breaking/2007/0601/breaking72.htm  Reuters via the ''Irish Times'', "'Unknown' tribe found in Amazon"  1 June 2007]&lt;/ref&gt; They are estimated to have about 87 members. They were discovered in May 2007 when two tribesmen entered a Kayapo village in the Menkregnoti reservation. The Metyktire form part of the Kayapo people and speak an archaic version of the Kayapo language.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/n/a/2007/06/01/international/i194021D74.DTL Associated Press via the ''San Francisco Chronicle'', "Indian Tribe Found in Brazil's Amazon", June 1 2007]&lt;/ref&gt;

When discovered, they had not had any known contact with Western civilization. This was attributed to their location on the {{convert|12100000|acre|km2|-2|sing=on}} reservation, in an area difficult to access due to dense jungle and lack of nearby rivers. The Metyktire had had little to no recent contact with other Kayapo until the 2007 visit.&lt;ref name="ap"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2007/06/01/america/LA-GEN-Brazil-Indians.php|title=Uncontacted Indian tribe found in Brazil's Amazon|publisher=Associated Press|date=2007-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Kayapo believe the Metyktire formed when several families fled deeper into the jungle in the 1950s.&lt;ref name="ap" /&gt;

Neither men nor women wear clothes. Men wear [[penis]]-protection. The women shave their heads.

'''Mru''' is a [[Sino-Tibetan languages|Sino-Tibetan language]] and one of the recognized [[languages of Bangladesh]]. It is spoken by a community of [[Mro people|Mros]] (Mru) inhabiting the [[Chittagong Hill Tracts]] of [[Bangladesh]] with a population of 22,000 according to the 1991 census, and in [[Burma]]. The Mros are the second-largest tribal group in [[Bandarban District]] of the [[Chittagong Hill Tracts]]. A small group of Mros also live in [[Rangamati Hill District]].

The Mru language is considered "Severely endangered" by [[UNESCO]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2011/apr/15/language-extinct-endangered|title=Endangered languages: the full list|last=Evans|first=Lisa|date=2011-04-15|website=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=2018-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Classification==
Mru forms the [[Mruic languages|Mruic language branch]] with [[Hkongso language|Hkongso]] and [[Anu language|Anu]], which are spoken in [[Paletwa Township]], [[Chin State]], [[Myanmar]]. The position of Mruic with Sino-Tibetan is unclear.

==Distribution==
[[Image:Map Bandarban.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Map of [[Bandarban District]]]]
The Mros live in forest areas of Lama, Ruma, Alikaram, and Thanchi near Chimbuk Mountain of [[Bandarban District]] (Rashel 2009). They also live in [[Sittwe]] (Akiab), [[Rakhine State]], Burma.

==Subdivisions==
There are five Mru dialects according to Ebersole (1996).
*Anawk
*Süngma
*Dopreng
*Tamsa
*Rengmitsa

There are five major Mro clans (Rashel 2009).
*Dengua
*Premsang
*Kongloi
*Maizer
*Ganaroo Gnar

Rashel (2009) also lists another classification scheme which lists ten Mro clans.
*Yarua (subdivisions below)
**Khatpo
**Chimlung
**Zongnow
**Chawla
*Yaringcha
*Tang
*Deng
*Kough
*Tam-tu-chah
*Kanbak
*Prenju
*Naichah
*Yomore

==Grammar==
Unlike the [[Kuki-Chin languages]], Mru has SVO ([[subject-verb-object]]) word order (Ebersole 1996).

==Numerals==
Rashel (2009:159) lists the following Mro numerals.
#lɔk
#pre
#ʃum
#taːli
#taŋa
#trok
#rinit
#riyat
#tako
#h:muit

==Alphabet==

The Mru alphabet is an indigenous, messianic script: In the 1980s Menlay Murang (also known as Manley Mro) created the religion of Khrama (or Crama) and with it a new alphabet for the Mru language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hosken|first=Martin|last2=Everson|first2=Michael|authorlink2=Michael Everson|date=24 March 2009|title=N3589R: Proposal for encoding the Mro script in the SMP of the UCS|url=http://std.dkuug.dk/jtc1/sc2/wg2/docs/n3589.pdf|accessdate=2 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Zaman | first = Mustafa | title = Mother Tongue at Stake | journal = Star Weekend Magazine | volume = 5 | issue = 83 | publisher = The Daily Star | date = 24 February 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Mru (or Mro) alphabet is written from left to right and has its own set of digits.  It does not use tone marks.

The Mru language is written using both the Latin and Mru alphabets.

===Unicode===
{{Main|Mro (Unicode block)}}
The Mru alphabet was added to the [[Unicode]] Standard in June, 2014 with the release of version 7.0.

The Unicode block for the Mru alphabet, called Mro, is U+16A40&amp;ndash;U+16A6F:

==The family==
Nathalie Mahy was the daughter of Didier Mahy and Catherine Dizier.  Stacy Lemmens was the daughter of Thierry Lemmens and Christiane Granziero. Granziero had been found guilty of [[child neglect]] and was arrested on January 17, 2008 for drug trafficking.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2006/06/23/wbelg23.xml  Search for sisters widens as Belgian nightmare returns], Daily Telegraph&lt;/ref&gt;

==Disappearance==
On June 10, 2006 at 01:00, the two were playing outside the bar "Aux Armuriers" in the borough Saint-Léonard, while Catherine Dizier and her friend Thierry Lemmens were inside, reportedly drunk{{Citation needed|date=June 2007}}.  Around 3 a.m., their disappearance was noticed and the police and [[Child Focus]] alerted.

==Investigation==
On June 13, the prime suspect, Abdallah Ait-Oud, turned himself in after seeing his photo on television.  He denied having anything to do with the case and claimed to have an alibi.  However, it was established that he was in the cafe that night.  Moreover, he has a history of child abuse, for which he was incarcerated.  He was released in December 2005 from a mental hospital after raping two minors, one being his niece.  He never admitted to his previous crimes.

On June 28, the bodies of both girls were found in a sewer in Liège, some 400 metres from the bar "Aux Armuriers".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vrtnieuws.net/nieuwsnet_master/versie2/english/details/060628_body/index.shtml Police discover body of young girl], VRT Nieuws&lt;/ref&gt; The Justice Department confirmed that the girls were murdered by strangulation, while Nathalie's body showed the signs of sexual abuse. On the same day, Dutch newspaper ''[[De Telegraaf]]'' received a letter with detailed information on the whereabouts of the two girls, a letter post-dated June 27.&lt;ref&gt;{{nl icon}} [http://www.telegraaf.nl/binnenland/45491601/Vindplaats_meisjes_gemeld_bij_De_Telegraaf.html  Vindplaats meisjes gemeld bij De Telegraaf], De Telegraaf&lt;/ref&gt;

The Justice Department also confirmed that [[DNA]] of a third person has been found on the bodies.  The identity of this third person has not yet been established, since incredibly, there are still no conclusive results of the DNA analysis.  His slight injuries and traces found on his clothes when Ait-Oud turned himself in are consistent with those he would have suffered when dumping the girls in the place they were found.&lt;ref&gt;{{nl icon}} [http://www.hln.be/hlns/cache/det/art_231762.html Nog geen bewijs tegen Ait Oud] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070310160625/http://www.hln.be/hlns/cache/det/art_231762.html |date=2007-03-10 }}, Het Laatste Nieuws&lt;/ref&gt; He is also said to have shaved his head the night of the disappearance. After looking into the investigation files, the father of Stacy Lemmens declared that he believed Ait-Oud was guilty.&lt;ref&gt;{{nl icon}} [http://www.hln.be/hlns/cache/det/art_231570.html Vader vermoorde Stacy: "Ait Oud is de dader"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060719094724/http://www.hln.be/hlns/cache/det/art_231570.html |date=2006-07-19 }}, Het Laatste Nieuws&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 14, 2006, it was reported that in the same neighbourhood where Mahy and Lemmens lived, an 11-year-old child was almost kidnapped at knifepoint by a 20- to 30-year-old man, were it not for a bystander who helped the child into safety. The suspect, of Slavic-Italian appearance, drove away in a [[Volkswagen Golf]] with a German license plate, together with an accomplice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Ontvoering Luiks meisje voorkomen|url=http://www.parool.nl/nieuws/2006/NOV/15/buit1.html|publisher=[[Het Parool]]|date=2006-11-14|language=nl}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criminal trial and sentence==
On June 10, 2008, Abdallah Ait Oud was found guilty by a jury of kidnapping, rape and murder of the children, and sentenced to life imprisonment (which, under the Belgian law, is most of the time not fully served in prison but later on changed into a [[suspended sentence]]&lt;ref&gt;{{nl icon}} [http://www.blikopdewereld.nl/Ontwikkeling/rechtspraak/70-levenslange-gevangenisstraf/536-hoe-lang-duurt-levenslange-gevangenisstraf-in-belgie.html Levenslang in België]&lt;/ref&gt;).&lt;ref&gt;{{fr icon}}[http://www.lesoir.be/actualite/belgique/assises-de-liege-l-assassin-2008-06-10-604850.shtml "Ait Oud, reconnu coupable, s'effondre" (lesoir.be)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080613024343/http://www.lesoir.be/actualite/belgique/assises-de-liege-l-assassin-2008-06-10-604850.shtml |date=2008-06-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{fr icon}}[http://www.lesoir.be/actualite/belgique/deliberation-sur-la-peine-au-2008-06-11-604935.shtml "La perpétuité pour Abdallah Ait Oud" (lesoir.be)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080613235013/http://www.lesoir.be/actualite/belgique/deliberation-sur-la-peine-au-2008-06-11-604935.shtml |date=2008-06-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''National Population and Family Planning Commission''' ('''NPFPC''', 2003-2013), formerly '''National Family Planning Commission''' (1981-2003), of the [[Government of the People's Republic of China]] was the state agency responsible for [[population]] and [[family planning]] in the [[People's Republic of China]]. The Commission was dissolved and superseded by the [[National Health and Family Planning Commission]] in March 2013, during the first session of the 12th National People's Congress.

The agency was managed by a minister and four vice ministers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.npfpc.gov.cn/en National Population and Family Planning Commission of China] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061201170356/http://www.npfpc.gov.cn/en/ |date=2006-12-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gender roles in society were as follows: fathers work outside of the home and bring in the bread (take on the role of providers), while mothers tend to housework, make sure they are emotionally available, and look after the children (take on the role of caretakers).&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  In today's time, the definition and responsibility of a parent has become more flexible/adjustable since the 1950s, although some parents tend to stick to their traditional gender roles.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; For example, two-married-parent families were the most common type of family unit a generation ago; however, in the year 2000 that particular family structure could only be found in one out of four households&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;.  Because of the shift in parenting, media outlets took it upon themselves to provide representation for certain family structures outside of the nuclear family, leaving them flexible as well.&lt;ref name=":32"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://web.asc.upenn.edu/gerbner/Asset.aspx?assetID=437|title=Media and the Family: Images and Impact|last=Gerber, G., Gross, L., Morgan, M., &amp; Signorielli, N.|first=|date=April 10-11, 1980|website=University of Pennsylvania|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=November 27, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mass media has presented a multitude of family structures and has promoted the acceptance of alternate family structures in many ways including television, newspapers, movies, commercials, books, comics, and etc.&lt;ref name=":32" /&gt; Media is linked to the structure of families, given that parents and their children confide in it when questioning their own family and parenting practices&lt;ref name=":32" /&gt;.

== Major theories ==

===Family and gender in general===
There have been a number of approaches to ultimately study the media's portrayal of the family. One theoretical approach surrounds the [[Cultivation theory|cultivation perspective]] which states that cultivation of a worldview skewed toward that of televised portrayals among heavy viewers. According to a 1976 study done by Gerber and Gross, this type of worldview becomes the social reality of television heavy viewers.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}} [[Social learning theory]] has also been used as a theoretical framework for study the effects that the media has on the individual.
Evidence also suggests that depictions can have serious consequences.  Television, according to a study done by Signorielli in 1990, entrenches the cognitive schema in children that women are happy when they are doing traditional gender roles like staying home to raise children and that men are more ambitious than women are.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Signorielli|first1=N|title=A Sourcebook on Children and Television.|date=1990|publisher=Greenwood Press|location=Westpoint, CT}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Family Enyclopedia"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Alexander|first1=Allison|last2=Kim|first2=Yeora|title=Television and Family – The Social Uses and Influence of Television on Families|url=http://family.jrank.org/pages/1681/Television-Family-Social-Uses-Influence-Television-on-Families.html|website=www.jrank,org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Portrayals of fathers ===
Early{{When|date=February 2016}} television fathers were depicted as bumbling fathers in working-class families, for example, [[Homer Simpson]] (The Simpsons) or authoritative figures in suburban families, for example, [[Ward Cleaver]] (Leave It to Beaver). Over time, changing economic and political situations contributed to changes in family life. As women began to work outside the home and domestic gender roles were adjusted, the idea of the [[nuclear family]] changed. Fathers adapted to be more nurturing to their children and more participative in family and domestic roles. Fogel, a television media expert, refers to this as the "new father;" he is a mix of traditional masculinity and traits typically associated with mothers.&lt;ref name="Fogel"&gt;Fogel, J. M. (2012). A modern family: The performance of "family" and familialism in contemporary television series (Order No. 3519570). Available from ProQuest Dissertations &amp; Theses Full Text: Literature &amp; Language; ProQuest Dissertations &amp; Theses Full Text: Social Sciences; ProQuest Dissertations &amp; Theses Full Text: The Arts; ProQuest Dissertations &amp; Theses Global: Literature &amp; Language; Pro(TRUNCATED). (1027039098).&lt;/ref&gt; Instead of simply being the breadwinner, the typical idea of the father has shifted to include traits associated with being a “good” father. This relies on both being supportive to his wife and to his children. The transition can be seen in the multi-generational family shown in [[Modern Family|''Modern Family'']]''.'' [[Jay Pritchett]], the father on the show with two adult children, says "90% of being a dad is just showing up." He represents the traditional idea of less involved parenting by the father. In comparison, [[Phil Dunphy]], who has three adolescent children, describes his parenting style as "peerenting," meaning he seeks to be both a peer and parent to his children. His more hands-on approach marks the transition from the father who just need to show up to the "new" father who is actively involved in his children's lives.

====Stay-at-home fathers====
The traditional role of "father" in the household is evolving; fathers are now expected to embrace more hands-on duties with their children. The roles are shifting so much that there has been an increase in "stay at home fathers", compared to previous generations. Also, increases of positively portrayed stay at home fathers in the media have been indicated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Riggs | first1 = J.M. | year = 1997 | title = Mandates for mothers and fathers: Perceptions of breadwinners and caregivers | url = | journal = Sex Roles | volume = 37 | issue = | pages = 565–580 | doi=10.1023/a:1025611119822}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Vavrus | first1 = M.D. | year = 2002 | title = Domesticating patriarchy: Hegemonic masculinity and television's "Mr. Mom | url = | journal = Critical Studies in Media Communication | volume = 19 | issue = | pages = 352–375 | doi=10.1080/07393180216564}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stay at home fathers have made appearances in television shows and documentaries. An increase in media presence can contribute to the understanding and support for men who choose to care for their children. This evolution of "fatherhood" shows the dynamic nature of parental roles. A few overarching themes in fatherhood were found in a study interviewing 32 men across the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Solomon | first1 = C. R. | year = 2014 | title = I feel like a rock star": Fatherhood for stay-at-home fathers | url = http://search.proquest.com/docview/1640746165?accountid=14816 | journal = Fathering | volume = 12 | issue = 1| pages = 52–70 | doi=10.3149/fth.1201.52}}&lt;/ref&gt; These themes consist of fathers feeling emotional closeness with their children, positive reaction from others about being a stay at home fathers, and importance and pride in family work. The typical reasons behind becoming a stay at home father: wives high salaries, job “issues”, and wives being relocated for their jobs.

==== Disneyland Dads ====
Disneyland dads refers to fathers who are considered to be the nonresidential parent.&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=STEWART|first=SUSAN D.|date=1999-07|title=Disneyland Dads, Disneyland Moms?|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/019251399020004006|journal=Journal of Family Issues|volume=20|issue=4|pages=539–556|doi=10.1177/019251399020004006|issn=0192-513X}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, any father can express this type of characteristic. "Disneyland dads" have the tendency to undertake recreational activities over real parental responsibilities that can include participating in their child's day-to-day activities.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; In other words, they represent the fun parent  while leaving the "residential parent" to deal with child rearing. These dads can be permissive and fail to discipline their children properly.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; Richard Gilmore, a father and grandfather in ''Gilmore Girls'', is a splitting image of this. Richard is rich and tends to buy his daughter's and granddaughter's love and approval with his money, while his wife, Emily Gilmore takes on the role of the disciplinarian. Mothers can be classified as Disneyland parents also.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; According to Stewart, information on Disneyland moms is harder to come by given the fact that mothers are more likely to display nurturing behaviors when they are primary caregivers, leaving secondary primary caregiving to the fathers who fall back on more leisure activities.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

=== Portrayals of mothers ===

==== 'New momism' ====
Susan Douglas and Meredith Michaels refer to "new momism" as shaping current Western motherhood.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Podnieks, E. (2012). ''Mediating Moms: Mothers in Popular Culture''. Montréal, QC:
McGill-Queen's University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; New momism introduces the myth of the perfect mother who assumes all the roles needed of her within the household, does so flawlessly, and emerges from the experience fulfilled and complete. Douglas and Michaels suggest that the media only superficially celebrates mothers by presenting standards, values, and practices that in reality place expectations on mothers that are impossible to reach. New momism is reinforced in the media through portrayals of perfect and unrealistic mothers, and through “news reports emphasizing the unspeakable tragedies that await children of mothers who dare deviate from the One True Path of Momism” according to Judith Stadtman Tucker. New momism also creates the false dichotomy of the “good” versus “bad” mother, and the media supplements viewers with the attitudes and practices that characterize both labels: the good mother is always in control, able to fulfill all responsibilities toward children and husband, while the bad mother is overwhelmed, disorganized, and lost among the chaos.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==== 'Mommy wars' ====
“[[Working parent#Mommy wars|Mommy wars]]," as introduced by Nina Darnton in a June 1990 ''Newsweek ''article, represents the media-staged tensions between [[Housewife|stay-at-home mothers]] and [[Working parent|working mothers]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Stay-at-home mothers criticize working mothers for abandoning their children and homes to build a personal career, while working mothers resent stay-at-home mothers both because of the time and attention they are able to devote to their children, and because of the notion that a mother is only "good enough" if she can devote all her time and attention to the children and household. Susan Podnieks argues that the "mommy myth", as well as the supposed battle between working and stay-at-home mothers, are circulated by news media and talk shows, sparking debates about the proper sphere of women. As a result, the general public believes that "there is a bitter war in the suburban cul-de-sacs of the United States between the complacent minivan-driving stay-at-home moms and the overachieving soon-to-be-burnout working mothers who still think they can have it all."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This leads to grouping mothers into rigid and rival categories, leading them to feel insecure about their mothering, and in turn leading them to devalue other mothers in order to elevate themselves.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==== Media mother police ====
The media mother police refers to the media's surveillance and policing of mothers (specifically famous mothers) by dissecting and evaluating their parenting practices. Susan Douglas and Meredith Michaels use the term to describe child care experts who engage in the practice of watching over famous mothers and judge their efforts, while Elizabeth Podnieks uses it to refer to reporters, the paparazzi, and all those involved within [[entertainment journalism]] who participate in maternal surveillance. The media mother police simultaneously reinforces ''The Mommy Myth'' by showcasing examples of perfect and airbrushed celebrity mothers, and also heightens the stigma of the "bad" mother by exposing the failures and debaucheries of certain celebrating mothers.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

====Portrayals of single mothers====
The depiction of single mothers in the media is crucial because it impacts children's views on parenthood. This topic became especially relevant after the 1990s{{According to whom|date=February 2016}}. Between 1986 and 1989 there was a 19% increase in pregnancy for 15- to 17-year-olds, consequently the number of single mothers increased.&lt;ref name="Larson"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Larson|first1=Mary|title=Sex Roles and Soap Operas: What Adolescents Learn About Single Motherhood|journal=Sociological Abstracts|date=1996|volume=35|pages=97–110|doi=10.1007/bf01548177}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a study conducted by sociologist Mary Larson, participants were asked to view several soap operas and comment on the role of the single mother. The study consisted of 163 junior and senior high-school students in a rural-suburban community in Northern Illinois in 1993. The student body was 9% minority and had an average family income of $41,000. The students in the study declared that most soap operas depict the single mother as white upper middle class with a successful job. Participants also noted that coping with a job and having a child did not seem to be a problem for the mothers. Their children were allowed to attend social events and each woman had a dominant male figure who helped with the baby on a daily basis. After viewing the shows, participants were asked to answer several questions on single mothers. Most responses indicate a skewed perception of being a single mother. Most students did not believe single mothers were more likely to live in poverty and that most babies had a dominant male presence in their lives.&lt;ref name="Larson" /&gt; Other scientists have determined that men are actually more commonly portrayed as single parents in prime time television. One study revealed that men outnumber women by three to one as being single parents. Additionally, women are more frequently portrayed as married in a home setting. Whereas single men never endure the conflict of balancing their work and family life, women are depicted as struggling to balance both.&lt;ref name="Bryant"&gt;{{cite book|title=Television and the American Family|last1=Bryant|first1=Alison|date=2001|publisher=Lawrence Elbraum Associates|location=New Jersey|pages=140|accessdate=April 10, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Portrayal of African American families===
Given the changing traditional structure of the American family, it would be suspected different family dynamics are depicted by different characters and themes. For example, one would expect television to encapsulate the different themes and qualities of the African American family that are a result of prejudice and discrimination.&lt;ref name=Bryant /&gt; However, studies have shown that the television characteristics of people of color do not reveal the unique experiences of being African, Latino, Native American or Asian American, but rather represent the perceptions of the White producers. From the period of 1969–1982 African American families were almost never portrayed as husband, wife and children living together under one roof. Moreover, most families were highlighted as being "poor and struggling". These representations make it appear as though African Americans cannot care for their families accurately. As pressure increased on the industry to produce a more accurate portrayal of the nuclear African American family, shows such as ''[[The Cosby Show]]'', ''[[227 (TV series)|227]]'', and ''[[Charlie &amp; Co.|Charlie &amp; Co]]'' became popular.&lt;ref name=Bryant /&gt; The emergence of these shows created a TV culture that more accurately depicted an intact African American family. Unfortunately, data reveals that the same cannot be said for other minority families such as Latino Americans.&lt;ref name=Bryant /&gt;     

=== Portrayal of Latino American Families ===
In 1984, the media portrayed Latinos as illegal aliens that were on the run.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Denzel de Tirado|first=Heidi|date=2013-12-16|title=Media Monitoring and Ethnicity: Representing Latino Families on American Television (2000-2013)|url=https://journals.openedition.org/nuevomundo/66165|journal=Nuevo mundo mundos nuevos|language=en|doi=10.4000/nuevomundo.66165|issn=1626-0252}}&lt;/ref&gt; This wasn't an accurate representation of who they really were and the lifestyles they lived in reality (doctors, lawyers, husbands, wives, etc.).&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; The study ''Latinwood and TV'' 2000 restated that Latino Americans were not accurately presented in the media.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; They were highly underrepresented and superficially/negatively illustrated on screen, usually characterized as nannies, gardeners, and servants.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Just as there was an uproar about media not accurately representing African Americans families properly, there was a similar issue for Latino Americans. With this issue, came the emergence of successful Latino-themed shows such as ''Dora the Explorer'', ''George Lopez'', ''Ugly Betty'', and ''Wizards of Waverly Place.''&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; As media outlets started to present more authentic Latino representation, it gave way for these shows to make an appearance: ''Jane the Virgin'', ''Queen of the South'', ''One Day at a Time'', and ''On My Block'' which is a show that represents both Latino and African American families and their culture.

== Major empirical findings ==

=== Television ===
Over time, television series have reflected the changing norms of real families.&lt;ref name="Douglas" /&gt; Viewers have regarded these television families as models of familial behavior despite the unrealistic nature of many television series.&lt;ref name="Fogel" /&gt;

Media expert Jennifer Fogel notes that families on television have evolved to focus more on strong marital partnerships, but many shows still focus on a traditional, patriarchal family.&lt;ref name="Fogel" /&gt; She suggests a number of different types of families that have been seen on television in the 21st century: parents adjusting to parenthood (e.g., [[Yes, Dear]]), dysfunctional yet loyal families (e.g., [[Arrested Development (TV series)|Arrested Development]]), and blended families (e.g., [[The New Adventures of Old Christine]]). For white families, television series have included single parenthood, divorced families, and multi-generational households.&lt;ref name="Fogel" /&gt; In comparison, minority families on television usually conform to nuclear family roles (e.g., [[George Lopez (TV series)|George Lopez]], [[Black-ish]]).

In an analysis of television shows, Dr. William Douglas found modern parent-child relationships to be judged as mutually respectful.&lt;ref name="Douglas"&gt;Douglas, W., &amp; NetLibrary, Inc. (2003). Television families is something wrong in suburbia? (LEA's communication series ^A1029732). Mahwah, N.J.: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates.&lt;/ref&gt; Though both mothers and fathers regularly provide support for their children, mothers were particularly likely to behave in a supportive or nurturing manner. In dealing with conflict, television fathers are more likely to use strategies which include blaming, rejection, aggressive questioning, and joking. They are more focused on winning an argument than protecting the relationship. Television mothers are more likely to use strategies that include emphasizing commonalities and using empathy in dealing with conflict such that relational goals are promoted over winning the argument. In modern television families, both mothers and fathers are more likely to work outside the home. Douglas suggests that the modern television family is reflective of the modern family in their problems.&lt;ref name="Douglas" /&gt; He asserts families are now unable to construct a nurturing family environment, including establishment of lasting relationships and effective socialization of children, in both families on television and in reality.&lt;ref name="Douglas" /&gt;

Scharrer (2001a) conducted a quantitative study investigating masculine roles within the home, and looked at 136 episodes of 29 domestic sitcoms airing from the 1950s to the 1990s. Scharrer found an increasing tendency to portray fathers as foolish and less adept at child care than mothers. The study revealed that fathers were the butt of 60% of all jokes involving the father in the 1990s sitcoms compared to 30% in the 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Scharrer, E. L. (2012).

===Movies===
Films that take place in the 1950s often portray an “ideal family” consisting of a breadwinner husband, a homemaker wife, and their children.  To an extent, this is a reflection of the times: upon the conclusion of [[World War II]], there was an increased importance put on the home.  Women were not expected to complete secondary education and instead were pushed towards finding a husband.  The film [[Mona Lisa Smile]] depicts a female professor's struggle with these expectations that have been put both on herself and her students.  Many of the professor's students drop out over the course of the film to become housewives and she ultimately fails at her mission of keeping her female students in school.  This "ideal family" model of the 1950s is outdated and unrealistic in today's world, however the myth lives on.  Continued media portrayal of this shapes public opinion and influences our beliefs.&lt;ref name="Sutherland"&gt;Sutherland, J., &amp; Feltey, K. (2010). Cinematic sociology: Social life in film. Thousand Oaks: Pine Forge Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Over the past 20 years,{{When|date=February 2016}} more and more women have been abandoning the homemaker role in favor of a position in the workforce.  There has been a distinct shift from the male-breadwinner model to more dual-earner and single-parent households, and that is not always reflected in film.  The movie ''[[I Don't Know How She Does It]]'' shows a working mother trying to balance a demanding job as well as familial duties.  The film ''[[Daddy Day Care]]'' is about a father that takes on the role of homemaker.  However, these two films are far from the norm{{According to whom|date=February 2016}} in terms of familial structure as seen in today's movies.  The industry has yet to catch up to the current family climate completely, but films with non-conventional families are becoming more and more common.

===Television commercials===
Gayle Kaufman, a professor from [[Davidson College]], explored the expanding social roles of men and women found on television in her article, "The Portrayal of Men's Family Roles in Television Commercials."&lt;ref name=Kaufman&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kaufman|first1=Gayle|title=The Portrayal of Men's Family Roles in Television Commercials|journal=Sex Roles|date=1999|volume=41|issue=5|pages=439–458|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023%2FA%3A1018878917810|issn=1573-2762|doi=10.1023/A:1018878917810}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through the use of empirical observations, Kaufman's research specifically focuses on the differences in the roles of mother and fathers portrayed by the media in national television commercials. Even though the roles of both men and women have expanded from the past, majority of the commercials were found to display traditional gender ideology. Gender differences found in commercials are prevalent.

Women were found to take on stereotypical roles in many types of commercials. With regards to [[Homemaking|housework]], women were found to be significantly more likely to be shown doing housework than men: cooking, cleaning, washing dishes, and shopping. Now, analyzing the data more closely, the reader can find that 79–80% of all cleaning and shopping in commercials are performed by women. Women were also found to be more responsible for washing dishes at 93% compared to men. Kaufman believes that this finding is based on the socialization process. Information not shown by the table includes the detailed explanation of the actions of the individuals in the study. With cooking commercials, many times the men and children were shown to be passively waiting to be served by their spouse. In cases where no mother is present, the same stereotypical roles are shown to be passed to the daughter as the father and/or brothers are passively waiting. Also, many of the domestic activities done by males are usually very manly, according to Kaufman, like taking out the trash. However, she says that men seemed incompetent about it. There were also striking differences in other activities as well.

When it came to interacting and spending time with children in commercials, men were found to be more likely than women to be with only boys. However, women were three times more likely to be seen with both boys and girls. Women were more likely to not only be with more children in commercials, they were more likely to take care of them as well. Compared to men’s 17.7%, women were 35.0% likely to be involved in some type of childcare activity (giving medicine, putting on bandages, etc.) in commercials. This finding was significant. Like mentioned earlier, men, were more likely to care for care for male children more than female children.

However, men did surpass women in three activities with children. Contrary to popular belief, men were found to actually teach kids lessons or read to them more than women. The data showed a significant 41% for men and only 14% for women. Men were also found to be eating with children more than women in commercials.

===Children's books===
David Anderson and Mykol Hamilton’s research focused on the portrayal of fathers and mothers in children’s books and speculated on the implications of it in their 2005 article “Gender Role Stereotyping of Parents in Children’s Picture Books: The Invisible Father”.&lt;ref name="Anderson and Hamilton"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Anderson|first1=D|last2=Hamilton|first2=M|title=Gender Role Stereotyping of Parents in Children's Picture Books: The Invisible Father.|journal=Sex Roles|date=2005|volume=52|issue=3|pages=145–151|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs11199-005-1290-8|issn=1573-2762|doi=10.1007/s11199-005-1290-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; They empirically analyzed two hundred children's picture books. Out of the 139 books with parents in them. 64% of the books had mothers in them and 47.5% had fathers in them. There were sixty four books that had scenes in them with only mothers but no father scenes. Also, 19% of the books had father only scenes and no mother scenes. In general fathers were not only highly underrepresented in the children's books, but they were also not even mentioned as much as mothers.

The research also focused on the activities and emotions performed by parents in the books. They found that mothers were close to 10 times more likely to care for babies than fathers were. Mothers in the books performed every measure of nursing behavior studied by the researchers two times more than fathers. Emotionally, mothers expressed varying emotions at a greater rate than the fathers. This is contrary to the opinion of the researchers who believed that fathers would express greater amounts of overall anger than did mothers. This is not the case. The findings were significant that mothers were more likely than men to express happiness, cry, or basically have any type of emotion what so ever. Mothers were also found to actually discipline more than fathers in children's books.

The researchers use this to make a number of speculations. The authors use these findings to question the socialization process of our younger children and point out, what they think, is a glaring problem. Fathers from the data took a back seat in the lives of the children throughout these children's books. Anderson and Hamilton fear that these stereotypical portrayals socialize children during critical periods of early development in their lives. When these cognitive schema are formed it is hard to change them as time goes on. Children, according to the researchers, will expect caregiving from the mothers and less from the fathers who seem almost invisible.

=== Magazines ===
A content analysis of women's magazines by both Keller (1994) and Douglas and Michaels (2004) revealed that the articles and ads within those magazines still reinforced traditional roles of motherhood, such as caring only for children and household tasks.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Women's magazines also encourage narrow understandings of motherhood through their misrepresentation of working mothers. Smith (2001) found that articles about working mothers and daycare between 1987 and 1997 usually portrayed working mothers in a negative light, discrediting women's belonging to the [[public sphere]] (the workplace) and reaffirming their role within the [[private sphere]] (the home).&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

A study conducted by Johnston and Swanson (2003) that analyzed 1998 and 1999 issues of women's and parenting magazines found that employed mothers were largely underrepresented compared to at-home mothers: working mothers were present in 12% of all mother-related text units as opposed to 88% for at-home mothers.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

===Media===
A study based in Hong Kong set out to examine “[[tween]]" girls in order to determine the media's influence on their perception of gender and identity roles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Chan | first1 = K. | last2 = Tufte | first2 = B. | last3 = Cappello | first3 = G. | last4 = Williams | first4 = R. B. | year = 2011 | title = Tween girls' perception of gender roles and gender identities: A qualitative study | url = | journal = Young Consumers | volume = 12 | issue = 1| pages = 66–81 | doi = 10.1108/17473611111114795 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These girls, ages 8–12, were asked to take images from the media to illustrate what they thought girls and women should or should not do. The sources of media used by the girls in the study included images from: newspapers, magazines, photos of advertisements (in subways, elevators, etc.), television, and Internet. The main goal of this was to find how the media influences the perception of women in the eyes of a "tween" girl. Previous studies have shown that although children might not perform behaviors the media characterizes as “normal” right away, they store these perceptions and recall them during “real life situations”.

The interviewers asked the tweens two questions and the interviewee’s were asked to reference a digital image they were asked to have captured. The girls were first asked how women/girls should or should not be. The responses were ultimately categorized under five major themes of how women and girls should act:
# personality
# skills and vocation
# appearance
# healthy and natural
# manners and relationships
The most popular responses in regards to personality were: be yourself, be brave, and be gentle. Skills and vocation responses reflected what jobs and skills a woman should have. Housekeeping was regarded as a good skill to have because boys have poor housekeeping skills. Appearance responses included what girls should look like, and how they should not (for example, girls should be presentable not sloppy). Under the category of healthy and natural interviewee’s were speaking of exercise, strength, and drug free lifestyles. Among the comments made by interviewee’s about manners and relationships were those about self-control, being conservative in sexual relationships, and self-representation in the public sphere. The second thing the girls were asked was what women should or should not do. The responses were categorized into themes, stated in order of most responses in a given category to least responses in a given category: 1) appearance, 2) health and safety, 3) relationships, 4) caring for people and environment, 5) work and others.

The conclusions made from this study were as follows. Tweens' perceptions of gender and identity roles mostly come from their role models. Tweens have conservative attitudes toward sexuality, despite racy advertisements. Tweens heavily favor natural beauty and reject practices that aim to reduce weight drastically. Tweens rejected and labeled sexy appearance and pre-marital sex as inappropriate. This study showed the perceptions tween girls had as a result of the media, giving proper insight into how young girls envision adults, including mothers in the media.

== Controversies ==
Recent{{When|date=February 2016}} films and television shows that challenge the traditional family ideal have been critically acclaimed and celebrated.  A non-traditional family structure is becoming more and more common in media.  However, some of the most popular examples have been the topic of debate.

The 2010 film ''[[The Kids Are All Right (film)|The Kids Are All Right]]'' depicts a same-sex couple, Jules and Nic, and their trials in raising two children.  The film was very well-received, garnering four Oscar nominations.  Critics applauded the movie for its depiction of a "realistic" lesbian couple, with [[Roger Ebert]] saying: "The Kids Are All Right centers on a lesbian marriage, but is not about one. It's a film about marriage itself, an institution with challenges that are universal.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ebert|first1=Roger|title=The Kids Are All Right|url=http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/the-kids-are-all-right-2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, the family structure in the film is a traditional one: Nic is the breadwinner and Jules is the homemaker.  This dynamic is a source of tension throughout the movie and is a major obstacle in their relationship.  The film is regarded as progressive while at the same time criticized for the archaic model of family.&lt;ref name="Sutherland" /&gt;

Television has a similar example in ''[[Modern Family]]''. Premiering in 2009 and chronicling three families portraying varying degrees social norms, ''Modern Family'' has received awards including 21 Emmys.  It has also been the subject of criticism in term of familial portrayal.  [[Phil Dunphy]], a father on the show, is portrayed as foolish and easily outmaneuvered by both his wife and children.  [[Claire Dunphy|Claire]], his wife, is an uptight stay-at-home mother who has become bored in her role in the family.  Many critics have pointed out that both mothers on the show are not employed.  In [[Modern Family (season 5)|season 5]] of the show Claire did return to work after her children had matured.  Although on the surface, Modern Family looks like a fresh perspective on today's family environment, it has its shortcomings.{{According to whom|date=February 2016}}  The traditional model of family can be seen in the Dunphy household despite the show's promise of a modern family.

== Conclusion ==
Society usually look to views of family planning on the social media and other raw media forms to develop a vauge notion,idea or plan of how a perfect family should be and act like.&lt;ref name="Fogel" /&gt; Over time, portrayals of both mothers and fathers in the media have adjusted to reflect changing familial norms.&lt;ref name="Douglas" /&gt; Both television and movies have reflected changes from the traditional family, though the nuclear family is still very present. Advertisements, children's books, and magazines still consistently represent traditional gender norms. Controversies have emerged in parental portrayals that seem to challenge traditional roles but, in reality, reinforce them.

He was a strong critic of and was widely known for his opposition to the United States' [[US war in Afghanistan|participation]] in the [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|war]] against the [[Taliban]] in neighbouring [[Afghanistan]].&lt;ref name=Dawn&gt;[https://www.dawn.com/news/776536 Former JI chief Qazi Hussain Ahmad passes away in Islamabad] Dawn (newspaper), Published 5 January 2013, Retrieved 10 December 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
===Background===
Qazi was born in 1938 in the house of ''Maulana Qazi Muhammad Abdul Rab'' at Ziarat Kaka Sahib, [[Nowshera District]], [[Khyber Pakhtunkhwa|Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa]], Pakistan.&lt;ref name=PakistaniLeadersOnline/&gt;

A teacher by profession, Maulana was appointed as the President of [[Jamiat-e-Ulema-e-Hind]] for its Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa branch before 1947.&lt;ref name=PakistaniLeadersOnline/&gt; Qazi Hussain Ahmed was the youngest among his ten siblings.

After having completed early education at home, Qazi Hussain Ahmad was admitted to [[Islamia College, Peshawar]] and got his Master of Science (MSc) degree in Geography from [[Peshawar University]]. He served as a lecturer at Jehanzeb College [[Swat District|Swat]] for three years, teaching at the graduate level. After that, he started his own business. He was elected as Vice-President, Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa (Provincial) [[Chamber of commerce and industry]]. Living in Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa gave him some familiarity with political affairs in neighboring [[Afghanistan]].&lt;ref name=PakistaniLeadersOnline/&gt;

===Personal life===
Qazi Hussain Ahmed had two sons (Asif Luqman Qazi and Anas Farhan Qazi) and two daughters.&lt;ref name=Tribune/&gt; His wife and children all are Jamaat-e-Islami activists. He spoke [[Urdu]], [[English language|English]], [[Arabic]], [[Persian language|Persian]], in addition to his native tongue, [[Pashto]].&lt;ref name=PakistaniLeadersOnline/&gt; He was a great admirer of the poet [[Allama Muhammad Iqbal]] and employed quotes from both Iqbal's Urdu and Persian poetry in his speeches and conversations.

During the 20th century in the [[Soviet Union]] there was a strong culture of [[tattoos]] being used to indicate one's criminal career and rank within Russian criminal and prison communities. Specifically for those imprisoned under the [[Gulag]] system of the Soviet era, the tattoos served to differentiate between who was an authority or [[thief in law]], and who was a political prisoner.&lt;ref name="Fuel"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Sidorov|first1=Danzig Baldaev. Vol. 3 / introduction by Alexander|title=Russian criminal tattoo encyclopedia|date=2008|publisher=Fuel|location=London|isbn=978-0-9550061-9-7|page=25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The practice grew in the 1930s, peaking in the 1950s and declining in popularity in the 1970s and 1980s.&lt;ref name="Fuel" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Sidorov|first1=Danzig Baldaev. Vol. 3 / introduction by Alexander|title=Russian criminal tattoo encyclopedia|date=2008|publisher=Fuel|location=London|isbn=978-0-9550061-9-7|page=43}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Origins ==
The [[Human branding#Branding in Russia|branding]] of criminals was practised in Russia long before tattooing was customary, and was banned in 1863. In the 19th century, a "pricked" cross on the left hand was often used to identify deserters from the army, and up until 1846, criminals sentenced to hard labour were branded "VOR" (''thief''), the letters on the forehead and cheeks. Brands were also applied to the shoulder blade and the right forearm, in three categories; "SK" for ''Ssylno-Katorzhny'' ([[katorga|hard labour convict]]), "SP" for ''Ssylno-Poselenets'' (hard labour deportee) and "B" for ''Begly'' (escapee). In 1846, VOR was replaced by "KAT"; the first three letters of the word for "hard labour convict" or ''katorzhnik''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Sidorov|first1=Danzig Baldaev. Vol. 3 / introduction by Alexander|title=Russian criminal tattoo encyclopedia|date=2008|publisher=Fuel|location=London|isbn=978-0-9550061-9-7|page=21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="DeMello2007"&gt;{{cite book|author=Margo DeMello|title=Encyclopedia of Body Adornment|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=s0122BsqrZwC&amp;pg=PA231|year=2007|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=978-0-313-33695-9|pages=231–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1930s, Russian criminal castes began to emerge, such as the ''Masti'' (suits) and the ''Vory v Zakone'' or ''Blatnye'' (authoritative thieves), and with that a tattoo culture to define rank and reputation. Up until World War II, any tattoo could denote a professional criminal, the only exception being tattoos on sailors.&lt;ref name="Fuel" /&gt;

Under the Gulag system of the Soviet era, laws that were implemented in mid-1940 allowed short prison sentences to be given to those convicted of petty theft, hooliganism, or labor discipline infractions. This led to an increase in the prison population during and after [[World War II]]. By January 1941, the Gulag workforce had increased by approximately 300,000 prisoners.&lt;ref name=khlev&gt;{{cite book| last= Khevniuk |first= Oleg V.|title=The History of the Gulag: From Collectivization to the Great Terror|year=2004|publisher=Yale University Press|pages=236–286}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tattoos served to differentiate between an authority or "thief in law", and the many hundreds of thousands of [[political prisoner]]s who were imprisoned during and shortly after World War Two for crimes not considered those of a "Vor" (thief).&lt;ref name="Fuel" /&gt;

Some of the motifs came from English [[sailor tattoos]], such as the flying tall ships, a heart pierced by a dagger, anchors, a serpent-entwined heart or a tiger baring its teeth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Sorrell]|first1=[Danzig Baldaev ; photography by Sergei Vasiliev ; edited by Miles Murray|title=Russian criminal tattoo encyclopedia|date=2006|publisher=FUEL Publishing|location=London|isbn=0-9550061-2-0|page=21|edition=1. edition, reprinted}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A thief's collection of tattoos represents his "suit" (''mast''), which indicates his status within the community of thieves and his control over other thieves within the thieves' law. In [[Fenya|Russian criminal jargon]] or ''Fenya'' (феня), a full set of tattoos is known as ''frak s ordenami'' (a tailcoat with decorations). The tattoos show a "service record" of achievements and failures, prison sentences and the type of work a criminal does. They might also represent his "thief's family", naming others within hearts or with the traditional tomcat image.&lt;ref name="FUEL Publishing"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Sorrell]|first1=[Danzig Baldaev ; photography by Sergei Vasiliev ; edited by Miles Murray|title=Russian criminal tattoo encyclopedia|date=2006|publisher=FUEL Publishing|location=London|isbn=978-0-9550061-2-8|page=37|edition=1. edition, reprinted}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Sorrell]|first1=[Danzig Baldaev ; photography by Sergei Vasiliev ; edited by Miles Murray|title=Russian criminal tattoo encyclopedia|date=2006|publisher=FUEL Publishing|location=London|isbn=978-0-9550061-2-8|page=30|edition=1. edition, reprinted}}&lt;/ref&gt; Misappropriation of the tattoos of a "legitimate thief" could be punished by death, or the prisoner would be forced to remove them themselves "with a knife, sandpaper, a shard of glass or a lump of brick".&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Sorrell]|first1=[Danzig Baldaev ; photography by Sergei Vasiliev ; edited by Miles Murray|title=Russian criminal tattoo encyclopedia|date=2006|publisher=FUEL Publishing|location=London|isbn=978-0-9550061-2-8|page=31|edition=1. edition, reprinted}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Bitch war ==
After the war a schism occurred in the criminal world. Many convicts had [[Shtrafbat|fought in penal units]], in contravention of the thieves' code that no thief should serve in the military or cooperate with authorities in any way. Many legitimate thieves found themselves demoted to ''frayer'' (outsider), ''muzhik'' (peasant), or ''suka'' (traitor, a bitch). This was part of a power struggle; with limited resources in prison, outlawing the "bitches" (''suki'') allowed the legitimate thieves to take more for themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Sidorov|first1=Danzig Baldaev. Vol. 3 / introduction by Alexander|title=Russian criminal tattoo encyclopedia|date=2008|publisher=Fuel|location=London|isbn=978-0-9550061-9-7|page=31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tattoos were modified and new designs appeared to distinguish between the two groups. The dagger piercing a heart was modified, adding an arrow: this tattoo indicated a legitimate thief and his desire to seek vengeance against those who had violated the thieves' code. The compass rose became an indicator of aggression to prison officials and the "bitches", indicating the vow that "I will never wear [[epaulette]]s" and hatred towards those who had served in the Soviet Army. Secret acronyms were created by legitimate thieves that the "bitches" wouldn't recognise, such as SLON (lit. "elephant"), meaning "''Suki Lyubyat Ostry Nozh''" ("Bitches love a sharp knife").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Sidorov|first1=Danzig Baldaev. Vol. 3 / introduction by Alexander|title=Russian criminal tattoo encyclopedia|date=2008|publisher=Fuel|location=London|isbn=978-0-9550061-9-7|page=33}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Khrushchev's reforms and decline of tattooing ==
In the 1950s [[Nikita Khrushchev]] declared a policy for the eradication of criminality from Soviet society. Along with propaganda denouncing the "traditional thief" that had grown in popularity in Russian culture, punishments in the prisons intensified for anyone that identified as a legitimate thief, including beatings and torture. As a response to this persecution, the thieves' laws were intensified and the punishment for prisoners wearing unearned tattoos increased from removal to rape and murder.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Danzig Baldaev (illustrations), Sergei Vasiliev (photography), Alexander Sidorov (introduction) |date=2008 |title=Russian Criminal Tattoo Encyclopedia |volume=3 |location=London |publisher=Fuel |isbn=978-0-9550061-9-7|page=39}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the 1970s, the intensification of the thieves' laws had resulted in reprisals against the legitimate thieves, orchestrated by prison authorities who would often throw a legitimate thief into cells with prisoners they had punished or raped.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"&gt;{{cite book |author=Danzig Baldaev (illustrations), Sergei Vasiliev (photography), Alexander Sidorov (introduction) |date=2008 |title=Russian Criminal Tattoo Encyclopedia |volume=3 |location=London |publisher=Fuel |isbn=978-0-9550061-9-7 |page=41}}&lt;/ref&gt; To reduce tensions, criminal leaders outlawed rites of passage and outlawed rape as a punishment. Fights between inmates were outlawed and conflicts were to be resolved through mediation by senior thieves. Additionally, a fashion for tattooing had spread through juvenile prisons, increasing the number of inmates with "illegitimate" tattoos. This ubiquity along with the reduction in violence meant that the "criminal authorities" stopped punishing "unearned" tattoos.

In 1985, [[perestroika]] and the new increase in tattoo parlours made tattooing fashionable, and further diluted the status of tattoos as a solely criminal attribute.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt;

== Application ==
The tattooists, or ''kol'shchiki'' (prickers), were held in high regard. Tattoo needles can be referred to as ''peshnya'' (ice pick), ''pchyolka'' (bee), ''shpora'' (spur), or ''shilo'' (sting), while the tattoo machine can be referred to as ''mashinka'' (little machine) or ''bormashina'' (dentist's drill), and the ink is referred to as either ''mazut'' (fuel oil) or ''gryaz'' (dirt). The tattoos themselves were referred to as a ''reklama'' (advertising), ''regalka'' (regalia), ''kleimo'' (brand), or ''rospis'' (painting).&lt;ref name="ReferenceB" /&gt;

== Designs ==
Common designs and themes grew over the years, often having different meanings depending on the location of the tattoo. The imagery often does not literally mean what it is depicting—for example, tattoos displaying [[Nazi]] imagery represent a rejection of authority rather than an adherence to Nazism. Combinations of imagery, such as a rose, barbed wire and a dagger, form combined meanings. According to lexicographer Alexei Plutser-Sarno, the tattoos become the only "real aspects of his life".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Sorrell]|first1=[Danzig Baldaev ; photography by Sergei Vasiliev ; edited by Miles Murray|title=Russian criminal tattoo encyclopedia|date=2006|publisher=FUEL Publishing|location=London|isbn=978-0-9550061-2-8|pages=35|edition=1. edition, reprinted}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are a symbol of the owner's commitment to war against the non-thief, the police (''menty''), and the "bitch" (''suka''). The environment in the Soviet era was one of heavy visual propaganda, and the tattoos are a reaction to that, and a "grin at authority" (''oskal na vlast''), often directly parodying official Soviet slogans with Communist Party leaders often depicted as devils, donkeys, or pigs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Sorrell]|first1=[Danzig Baldaev ; photography by Sergei Vasiliev ; edited by Miles Murray|title=Russian criminal tattoo encyclopedia|date=2006|publisher=FUEL Publishing|location=London|isbn=978-0-9550061-2-8|pages=35|edition=1. edition, reprinted}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Forced tattoos ==
There are tattoos that are forcibly applied to signify "demotion" (''razzhalovanie''). These may depict sexual acts, and are designed to lower the owner in the eyes of other prisoners and draw harsh treatment from them. These can be applied to those convicted of sexual crimes, those who have not paid a debt, stool pigeons (''ssuchenye''), stooges (''chukhany''), and signify that the owner is expelled from the privileged section of a thieves society and are "untouchables" (nepriskasaemye/chushki). Other thieves must not accept anything from them or be considered "infected" (''zakontachit'sya''). As a thief is "born" with his tattoos, they can also be used to signify his "death" and new status as an "untouchable". Even established thieves could be demoted, if, for example, they lost a card game and failed to honor their bets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Sorrell]|first1=[Danzig Baldaev ; photography by Sergei Vasiliev ; edited by Miles Murray|title=Russian criminal tattoo encyclopedia|date=2006|publisher=FUEL Publishing|location=London|isbn=0-9550061-2-0|page=39|edition=1. edition, reprinted}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Sakuddei''' or '''Sabiroet''' people are an [[ethnic group]], one of at least eleven, on the island of [[Siberut]], [[Indonesia]].  Siberut is the northernmost of the [[Mentawai Islands]] which are located {{convert|130|km|mi|abbr=on}} to the west off the coast of [[Sumatra]]. The Sakuddei live in south-central Siberut in an egalitarian society, cut off from the outside world. They speak a dialect of the [[Malayo-Polynesian languages|Malayo-Polynesian]] [[Mentawai language]].

Their society has been described as classless, [[egalitarian]], without leadership and warfare and with equality among men and women. They are described as living in peaceful harmony with their environment and with other groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.filmakers.com/index.php?a=filmDetail&amp;filmID=126|title=The Sakuddei of Indonesia, Disappearing World series, Produced by Granada Television International|year=1987|work=filmakers.com|accessdate=30 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Save&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.culturalsurvival.org/publications/cultural-survival-quarterly/indonesia/can-siberut-be-saved|title= Can Siberut Be Saved?|accessdate=2010-10-30|publisher=Cultural Survival}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Bakker (2007), the Sakuddei have commonly avoided modernization campaigns by retreating into Siberut's interior.&lt;ref name="Bakker"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bakker|first=Laurens|year=2007|title=Foreign images in Mentawai  Authenticity and the exotic|journal=Bijdragen tot de Taal-, Land- en Volkenkunde|publisher=Koninklijk Instituut voor Taal-, Land- en Volkenkunde|volume=163|issue=2/3|page=279|url=https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&amp;q=cache:vdLoltdWWQAJ:www.kitlv-journals.nl/index.php/btlv/article/view/28/27+sakuddei+tattoos&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=us&amp;pid=bl&amp;srcid=ADGEESjjIvVVO6X-5Hgug0bT3c77ZQmMmNZ5t4hsjWCu_olWG_y9FIlFugTqOyGvV7TzAV5YLiinNfPD2xd7oha6R_HsSsihyGQoXLYOa3L__CSkzTdBjQvRU0-vE0Wnsr9y4ihwQupr&amp;sig=AHIEtbQNtwCwDxmJmYSB5OZZrg3geIf8nQ}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Siberut island river.jpg|thumb|left|River banks where the Sakuddei reside in [[Siberut]].]]
Through known history, since the missionaries started conversion of indigenous people into [[Christianity]], the ethnographic profile of the people of Siberut has been closely observed by many anthropologists. The earliest record of the island people is by Sir Thomas Raffles, who after visiting the island in 1821, commented “I made further discoveries in these Islands, where I found a population more likable still and, if possible, still more ingenuous. If I continue in this direction, I may expect somewhere to find the "Garden of Eden", and descendants of our first parents."&lt;ref name=Save/&gt; The first conversion of the indigenous people was started by the [[Italy|Italian]] [[Missionaries]] in 1912, though earlier efforts made from 1911 had resulted in the murder of the missionary named Reverend Mr. Lett in 1916. This is the first reported effort at elimination of the local ethnic culture of shamanism.&lt;ref name=Save/&gt; Some [[Catholic priest]]s understood the nuances of ethnic culture and adopted many of the ethnic customs such as wearing beads while offering sermons during  mass.&lt;ref name=Save/&gt; However, in 1917, J.F.K. Hansen, the [[Dutch Army]] Captain, was critical of the [[pagan]] customs of the local people and wondered how this custom could be discouraged.&lt;ref name=Save/&gt; 

In the early 1990s, plans were afoot to develop the rain forests of the Mentawai Islands where the indigenous people of Siberut, the Sakuddei, one of the few Siberut clans live, into a [[palm oil]] plantation, as a commercial proposition. The [[Government of Indonesia]] has also not been averse to this conversion since palm oil, an imported item, could be produced on a large scale locally, which would save foreign exchange and supplement the local economy of the country. The district administration at one stage, in the 1980s, had even ordered discontinuing the [[shaman]]istic rites and forcible possession of the ethnic paraphernalia of [[shamanism]], which was later stopped. However, in recent years, with international publicity to the local ethnic people, through various media channels, the area where the Sakuddei live has attracted tourist influx, which is now identified as an economic benefit.&lt;ref name=Save/&gt; 

In spite of efforts by various international agencies to influence decision making on encroaching civilization of local ethnic groups, a [[Philippines]] timber company has been granted a logging concession in their area,&lt;ref name=Save/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.therai.org.uk/film/the-series-of-disappearing-world/the-sakuddei/|title=The Sakuddei|work=therai.org.uk|accessdate=30 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is threatening their distinctive way of life. All this is happening in spite of the area having been declared as a "[[Biosphere Reserve]]" by [[UNESCO]], in 1981. [[World Wide Fund for Nature]] (WWF) is persisting with its conservative efforts in association with [[Andalas University]] of [[West Sumatra]] "to study and monitor socioeconomic and biotic conditions in Siberut and the rest of Mentawai".&lt;ref name=Save/&gt;

==Culture==
[[File:Frauen aus dem Dorfe Katorai auf der Insel Sibiru (Mentaweigruppe).jpg|thumb|upright|Ethnic women of [[Siberut]] with tattoo painting.]]
Bisht and Bankoti (2004) state that there are at least 11 culturally different communities on Siberut Island. The [[Leiden University]] anthropologist, [[Reimar Schefold]], spent several years living on Siberut amongst the Sakuddei. According to Schefold, "Everything from people to pigs, rocks to weather, has its own [[spirit]] which is quite separate from its 'host' and is free to wander as it wishes.  That's why you see that everybody has a different pattern of tattoos -- they want to make sure that their spirit can recognize the right body when it comes back from its nightly travels."&lt;ref name="McNeely"&gt;{{cite book|last1=McNeely|first1=Jeffrey A. |last2=Sochaczewski|first2=Paul Spencer |title=Soul of the tiger: searching for nature's answers in Southeast Asia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=U8wlr690kacC&amp;pg=PA161|year=1995|publisher=University of Hawaii Press|isbn=0-8248-1669-2|page=161}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, winds of change is affecting the younger generation of Sakuddeis' clan as observed by one of their elderly leader, known as ''rimata'', who said: {{cquote|"My children are  not like me. I wanted to tattoo them, and they refused. They want to be modern. If that's what they want, it's fine with me. But I like my tattoos and my loincloth. I am Mentawai until I die.&lt;ref name=Save/&gt;}}
[[File:Mentawai Uma.jpg|thumb|left|A traditional Sakuddei communal house, "[[uma longhouse]]" in [[Siberut]].]]

===Housing===
Their traditional house, an "[[uma longhouse]]", is built on stilts.&lt;ref&gt; As described by Schefold, R., ''Speelgoed voor de zielen: Kunst en cultuur van de Mentawai-eilanden.'' Delft/Zürich: Volkenkundig Museum Nusantara/Museum Rietberg.(1979/80) and others.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.leidenuniv.nl/fsw/nas/pub_houseIndonesia.htm The Sakuddei House] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080228214918/http://www.leidenuniv.nl/fsw/nas/pub_houseIndonesia.htm |date=2008-02-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This traditional house, located along the river banks, is where formal ceremonies known as ''punen'' are held, when the entire clan assemble here. However, under normal circumstances the ''rimata'' and his immediate family reside in the ''uma'', which are distinct from the habitats developed by the Dutch as thickly populated ghettos during their colonial rule.&lt;ref name=Save/&gt;

Generally, the lay out plan of ''Uma'', the building traditionally common to the people living in Siberut, has been elaborated by Reimar Schefold, as a three part structure with multiple floors. The [[gable]]s slant outwards with a number of [[finial]]s. It has outward sloping walls. The roof appears in the shape of a saddle and the structure is built with timber with a degree of difference between the roof and the tip. Practical and social reasons, aesthetic values, symbolic representations are the main attributes of these structures. It is also said that many a times the symbolism pervades the design of the building.&lt;ref name= Schefold&gt;{{Cite book|last= Schefold|first= Reimar |author2=P.

In 1980, Jowa I. Kis-Jovak noted that during adolescence, some Sakuddei boys build themselves a special house.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Fox|first=James J. |title=Inside Austronesian houses: perspectives on domestic designs for living|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4JavFdIXo3oC&amp;pg=PA229|year=1993|publisher=ANU E Press|isbn=0-7315-1595-1|page=229}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2081">'''Sectoral output''' for an industry or combination of industries ("sector") is the value of the sector's [[gross output]] minus the value of shipments within the sector from one establishment to another. 
Value here is measured for a specified time period and usually in units of nominal money.  It may be converted to constant units by multiplying by a [[price index]] to adjust for changes in prices over time and changes in quality of the goods and services produced.
A sectoral output measure is conceptually different from measures of [[gross output]] or [[value added|value-added output]].  Gross output for the sector consists of sales, or receipts, and other operating income, plus commodity taxes and changes in inventories.  Value-added measures exclude the value of intermediate inputs such as material, energy, and services, whether from the same industry or others. Thus gross output is larger than sectoral output which is larger than value-added output.
Sectoral output is the measure of output used in "KLEMS" [[multifactor productivity|multifactor measures of productivity]], which attempt to account for all direct inputs to production: capital services (K), labor services (L), energy (E), materials purchased (M), and services purchased (S)
When calculating [[labor productivity]], a value-added measure of output should be used to avoid counting other inputs (like purchased materials) as if they were created by the labor and capital applied within the sector.
The definition of the sectoral output has been attributed to Frank M. Gollop.&lt;ref&gt;[http://stats.bls.gov/mfp/mprgul95.pdf Gullickson, William. Measurement of productivity growth in U.S. manufacturing]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sergei Ivanovich Shchukin''' ({{lang-ru|Серге́й Ива́нович Щу́кин}}; 27 May 1854 – 10 January 1936) was a Russian businessman who became an art collector, mainly of French [[Impressionist]] and [[Post-Impressionist]] art.

==Early life and family==
Sergei Ivanovich Shchukin was born on 27 May 1854 in Moscow, one of ten children&lt;ref name=times&gt;"The man who loved Monet: Russia's greatest art collector" by Nancy Durrant, ''Saturday Review'', ''The Times'', 15 October 2016, pp. 8-9.&lt;/ref&gt; of [[Ivan Vassilievitch Shchukin]], a self-made Moscow merchant, and his wife Ekaterina Shchukin, née Botkin, the daughter of an established family of merchants.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.morozov-shchukin.com/html/AhistoA.html Sergei Ivanovitch Shchukin.] Retrieved 22 October 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; I.V. Shchukin and Sons Trading Company became one of the largest manufacturing and wholesale companies in Russia.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artmaecenas.ru/schukin_family/schukin_si/page13_index.php?lang=en Sergei Ivanovich Shchukin.] [[Pushkin State Museum of Fine Arts]]. Retrieved 22 October 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Art collection==
There were several art collectors in the Shchukin family. Sergei's brother [[Pyotr Shchukin]] built an important collection of Russian ancient art and artifacts and owned several impressionist masterpieces,&lt;ref name=times/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.hermitage.nl/en/tentoonstellingen/matisse_tot_malevich/achtergrond-sjtsjoekin.htm Sergey Shchukin and Others.] Hermitage Amsterdam. Retrieved 22 October 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; while his brother [[Dimitri Shchukin]] assembled "Moscow's best collection of Old Masters" that eventually entered the [[Pushkin Museum]]. Another brother, [[Ivan Shchukin|Ivan]], also collected art.&lt;ref name=times/&gt;

Shchukin made his first art purchases following a trip to Paris in 1897, when he bought his first [[Monet]]. He later bought numerous works to a total of 258 paintings decorating the walls of his palatial home in [[Moscow]].

By 1914, Shchukin owned thirteen [[Monet]] paintings, including the iconic ''[[:File:Claude Monet 022.jpg|Lady in the garden]]'' and the smaller but complete version of ''Picnic'', three by [[Renoir]], eight by [[Cézanne]], including ''Carnival'' ([[:File:Paul Cézanne 060.jpg|Mardi Gras]]), four by [[Van Gogh]], including the ''[[Portrait of Dr. Felix Rey]]'' (but the most famous Van Gogh paintings in Russia, ''Prison Courtyard'' and ''[[The Red Vineyard]]'', were purchased by Shchukin's friend and competitor, Ivan Abramovitch Morozov), sixteen by [[Gauguin]] of the Tahitian period, which hanged in his dining room in the manner of an orthodox [[iconostasis]]), seven by [[Henri Rousseau]], sixteen by [[Derain]], eight by [[Albert Marquet]], and two by [[Maxime Dethomas|Dethomas]]. 

Shchukin was particularly notable for his long association with [[Matisse]], who decorated his mansion and created one of his iconic paintings, ''[[The Dance (painting)|La Danse]]'', specially for Shchukin. ''[[The Dance (painting)|La Danse]]'' is commonly recognized as "a key point of (Matisse's) career and in the development of modern painting".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Russell T. |last=Clement |title=Four French Symbolists |publisher=Greenwood Press |year=1996 |page=114 |isbn=0-313-29752-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Henri Matisse]] created one of his major works ''[[The Dance (painting)|La Danse]]'' for Shchukin as part of a two painting commission, the other important painting being [[Music (Matisse)|Music]], 1910. An earlier version of ''[[The Dance (painting)|La Danse]]'' (1909) is in the collection of [[The Museum of Modern Art]] in [[New York City]].
The collection also featured fifty choice works by [[Pablo Picasso]], including most of his earliest Cubist works, such as ''Three Women'' and major landscapes, but some key pieces of the Blue and Rose periods as well. In 1909, Shchukin opened his home on Sundays for public viewings, introducing French [[avant-garde]] painting to the Moscovites. [[Image:Matissedance.jpg|thumb|right|300px|[[Henri Matisse]], ''[[The Dance (second version)]],'' 1910, 260 x 391&amp;nbsp;cm, The [[Hermitage Museum|Hermitage]], (Matisse's second version of the painting).]]

==After the revolution==
After the 1917 [[Russian Revolution (1917)|Revolution]], the government appropriated his collection (decree of the Council of the people commissioners, signed Lenin, November 8, 1918) while Shchukin escaped to Paris, where he died in 1936. His mansion in Moscow became the State Museum of New Western Art (Государственный Музей нового западного искусствa, section I), the section II being the mansion and collection of the other famous Russian patron [[Ivan Morozov]]. Eventually (1928), the two sections were merged and exhibited in the former Ivan Morozov mansion at Prechistenka, 21.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kommersant.ru/doc.aspx?DocsID=693877 Новое решение картинного вопроса], «Власть» 30 (684), 31.07.2006.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1948 the State Museum of New Western Art was closed down by a decree signed by Stalin due to its allegedly bourgeois, cosmopolitan and wrongly oriented artworks. The two collections were randomly divided between the [[Pushkin Museum of Fine Arts]] and the State [[Hermitage Museum]] in [[St. Petersburg]].

==Death and legacy==
Shchukin died on 10 January 1936 in Paris.

[[Irina Antonova]], Director of the Pushkin Museum, once remarked about Shchukin: "He started to collect unpopular art, which was snubbed by the [[Louvre]] and other museums. It was his personal taste. Perhaps he heard foreshocks that would change the world. Such a collector could appear only in a country that awaited a revolution. He collected art that prefigured the global cataclysms".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.rg.ru/2005/02/08/antonova.html |title=Ирина Антонова: Леонардо приравняли к стульям и диванам |newspaper=[[Rossiyskaya Gazeta]] |date=8 February 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Notable silver rushes have taken place in [[Mexico]], [[Argentina]], the [[United States]] ([[Colorado]], [[Nevada]], [[California]], [[Utah]]), and [[Canada]] ([[Cobalt, Ontario]], and the [[Kootenays|Kootenay]] district of [[British Columbia]]).  Several famous tourist towns owe their existence to silver rushes.

==History==

Historically there were other "silver rushes", such as on the [[Attica|Attic]] peninsula near [[Athens, Greece]], thousands of years ago. The silver mines of [[Laurion]] became famous for their  exploitation and helped fund the new state of [[Athens]]. The term is also widely applied to the [[New World]]. Despite the larger-than-life image of the [[gold rush]], the history of towns and industry in the North American West revolves much more around silver.  This is partly because of the other minerals usually found with it – lead, tin, copper – and the more complicated [[smelting]] process associated with it because of the chemical complexity of its ores (usually [[galena]]).  The line between a smelter town and a silver mining town is very slim in many cases, although copper mining towns typically also have large smelters (such as [[Anaconda, Montana]]) and industrial complexes associated with them.  

The pursuit for silver often opens up other mineral deposits for development because of the variety of other useful ores that occur with it, especially in galena, its most common natural form.  Hence the [[Boundary Country]] of [[British Columbia]], just across the international border from [[Spokane, Washington]], had a strong mining and smelting economy based on the non-silver components of galena, and the nearby city of [[Trail, British Columbia|Trail]] remains a functioning smelter town (long after the long-established industrial complex of the [[Boundary Country|Boundary District]] has faded into a [[ghost town]]).

Hardrock mines tend to last longer than [[Placer mining|placer]] gold mines, and so silver mining towns last longer and have more time to develop than placer gold rush towns, which often peak within a few years.  Silver mining towns typically last a few decades, with time to develop the opulence and luxury that only left the slightest traces in placer gold-fevered places such as [[Dawson City, Yukon|Dawson City]] in the [[Klondike, Yukon|Klondike]].  By contrast, "silver cities" like [[Aspen, Colorado]], and [[Nelson, British Columbia]], often survived as functioning economies into the era of modernization and the advent of tourism (which sometimes proves richer than any silver mine).

The '''Telefol people''' are an ethnic group in the [[Sandaun Province]] of [[Papua New Guinea]].

==History==
Telefol history starts with the "Old Woman" ([[Afek (mythology)|Afek]]) traveling through the land that is now the Eliptaman valley. She, as told through their creation stories, founded the [[Telefolip]], the most sacred of [[Yolam Houses]] or [[Haus Tambaran]] in the [[Star Mountains]] Region about 300 years ago. Myth has it that there is an underground tunnel system between [[Mount Fubilan]], the Yolam House at [[Bultem]] and the Telefolip exists, and that is how shell money and other valuable items came to the Telefol.&lt;ref&gt;Jorgensen 1980&lt;/ref&gt;

The Telefol defeated the [[Telefol language|Telefol]]-speaking [[Iligimin people]] after the Iligimin people razed the Telefolip in the 19th century. The Telefol then proceeded to settle their lands.&lt;ref name="everyculture2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.everyculture.com/Oceania/Telefolmin-History-and-Cultural-Relations.html|title=History and cultural relations - Telefolmin|publisher=everyculture.com|accessdate=2014-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

They then went on to defeat the [[Untou people]], ritualistically cannibalizing the adults and absorbing the children into their group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa3800/is_200704/ai_n19198593/pg_11/ | work=Human Organization | title=Ironies of Organization: Landowners, Land Registration, and Papua New Guinea's Mining and Petroleum Industry | first=Alex | last=Golub | year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Once the [[Untoumin people|Untoumin]] were annihilated, the Telefolmin and [[Miyanmin people|Miyanmin]] would sometimes raid each other until the later 1950s, when pacification occurred.&lt;ref name="anu"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://epress.anu.edu.au/apem/customary/html/ch04s03.html|title=Legibility and Recognition in Nenataman|publisher=epress.anu.edu.au|accessdate=2014-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Culture==

The Telefol were part of a ritual system encompassing all of the [[Mountain Ok people|Min peoples]].&lt;ref&gt;Robbins 2004, p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt; They were acknowledged by the Min as being at the highest level of sacred knowledge, and groups such as the [[Baktaman people|Baktaman]] were at the lowest level. The Telefolmins' level may have been matched by the [[Urapmin people|Urapmin]].&lt;ref&gt;Robbins 2004, p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Telefol possess a ubiquitous accessory called the [[bilum]]. Young children are introduced to the skills of bilum-making.&lt;ref&gt;Ingold 2000, p. 354.&lt;/ref&gt;

Magalim, a [[masalai]] or bush spirit of great significance to the Telefol is active at the fringes of Telefol consciousness. He is known by various names such as Aanang Kayaak, Tenum Misim, Bagan Kayaak. He is a "boss" of all things wild and of the forests.&lt;ref&gt;Jorgensen 2002, p. 73&lt;/ref&gt;  Magalim takes many forms: a snake, a dog, an overly generous European, a headless European, and a four glowing-eyed [[Ok Tedi Mine|Ok Tedi]] worker who ran speedily over the landscape &lt;ref&gt;Jorgensen 2002; Jorgensen 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

===Counting system===

The [[Telefol language]]'s [[base-27]] counting system is mapped onto the body by counting each of the following: the left pinky to the left thumb (1-5); the wrist, lower arm, elbow, upper arm, and shoulder (6-10); the side of the neck, ear, and left eye (11-13); the nose (14); and the right eye to the right pinky (15-27; as for 1-14 but mirrored and in reverse order).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.math.bas.bg/~iad/serafin.html#Telefol Telefol counting]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Tanglin Club''' is one of the most prominent and prestigious [[social club]]s in [[Singapore]]. As of end 2009 the club had an active membership of 7,810, comprising approximately 70 different [[nationality|nationalities]]. Its clubhouse is located off Stevens Road, near the centre of town in Singapore. The club's facilities include four [[restaurant]]s, five [[bar (establishment)|bars]], several function rooms, a [[movie theater|cinema]]/[[theater (structure)|theatrette]], two [[library|libraries]], and extensive [[sport]]s and [[recreation]] facilities including two [[swimming pool]]s, a [[gym]]nasium, a four-table [[billiards]] room, four outdoor and two indoor [[tennis]] courts, six single and two jumbo double [[squash (sport)|squash]] courts and a large roof-top lawn bowls green. The Club's sports sections offer external activities such as scuba diving and golf, and a new sports complex was completed in 2008.

The Tanglin Club was founded in 1865. Its founding President was Singapore's first [[Commissioner of Police (Singapore)|Police Commissioner]], [[Thomas Dunman]].

==History==
;The Founding Years
The Tanglin Club, one of Singapore's most prestigious and prominent social clubs, was founded in 1865 to cater to the social and recreational needs of locally based British officials and expatriates. That year, an interim committee was formed, and it comprised Thomas Dunman (President), Herbert Buchanan (Vice-President), Lancelot C. Masfen, Jos. M. Webster, William Mulholland, Walter Oldham, Edwin A. G. C. Cooke and John R. Forrester. Although race was not stipulated as a criterion for membership, only Europeans were admitted. Club members however, were mainly British. While the exact foundation date of The Tanglin Club is uncertain, it is suspected that the date which had been determined by The Tanglin Club Centenary Celebrations Committee in 1865 was the most convenient day to hold the celebrations. Two letters, which appeared in the Singapore Daily Times on 11 and 13 November 1865, allude to the formation of the club, and that in October 1865, legal documents show without doubt this club to be The Tanglin Club.

On 26 June 1866, a property was purchased in the District of Claymore from Arthur Hughes de Wind for 600 dollars. In December 1866, the trustees of the club borrowed 5,000 Spanish dollars to build a clubhouse with bowling alleys, billiards rooms and stables. 

;Tanglin
It is quite a mystery to why the club was named ‘Tanglin’, as there is no authority defining the origin or meaning of ‘Tanglin’. There exists, however, an ''asok'' or ''asoka'' tree related to the saraca tree which is recorded In Malay, although, the Malays generally refer to this native species as ''gapis'', ''talan'', ''tengalan'' or ''tanglin''. Sacred among the Hindus and particularly sacred to the Buddhists as being the tree under which the Buddha was born, this beautiful flowering tree with golden-orange flowers and deep purple pods up to twelve inches long is not common in present-day Singapore.

Another derivative for Tanglin may be a corruption of the Chinese words ''tang ling'' – ''tang'' meaning ‘eastern side’, and ''ling'' ‘a small hill’. In the 1860s, there were plenty of hills in the districts of Tanglin and Claymore – Nassim Hill, Mount Elizabeth, Cairnhill, Claymore Hill and Goodwood Hill.

While it may never be known how the name ‘Tanglin’ originated, but as there are many places in Malaysia named after trees, it is possible that the club was named after the tree of the same name – perhaps one was growing on the very spot where the clubhouse stood.

;A Tumultuous Start
About two years after its founding, the club’s management committee was unable to repay the first instalment of 2,000 Spanish dollars, which was due on 30 November 1868. The costs of construction of the clubhouse and the provision of amenities combined with the expenses involved in running the club must have placed a tremendous burden on its financial resources. The financial strain was made worse when the second instalment of the principal mortgage sum was due on 30 November 1871; the club was again unable to pay both that and the sum of 2,000 dollars.

Ten years after the loan of 5,000 dollars was drawn, the club could not afford to repay any of the principal sum borrowed. Even the staff’s wages were left unpaid.

An extraordinary general meeting of the club was then called on 20 June 1876 to resolve the club’s indebtedness. The meeting passed four resolutions, including appointing a committee to enquire and report to an adjournment of this meeting whether any person will advance 5,000 dollars on a mortgage of the club, and that a Member be appointed to purchase the property and re-mortgage the whole property to the new mortgage. No records of subsequent meetings are available but it is evident that The Tanglin Club literally went under the hammer.

Nevertheless, the club continued to function notwithstanding the charge and conveyance of its property, but likely only so because of the somewhat complex financial arrangement that had been devised to permit the continued use of the club and its facilities by its members. The saga of the original loan of 5,000 dollars continued until nearly the turn of the last century when the club’s membership numbered around two hundred. In 1899, the club’s indebtedness arising from this loan was finally totally discharged.

;World Wars of the 20th Century
By the 1890s, the Claymore district had evolved into a prestigious district occupied by many prominent European residents. During the construction of the German Teutonia Club (present-day [[Goodwood Park Hotel]]), The Tanglin Club accommodated the Teutonia members. When the palatial Teutonia Club was completed in 1900, it quickly overshadowed the old and dismal looking The Tanglin Club. The Tanglin Club's German membership had dwindled from a strong number of 236 a decade ago to 181 in 1911. When World War I broke out in 1914, Teutonia Club was declared an enemy property.

Several years after the end of the First World War in the early 1920s, The Tanglin Club purchased additional blocks of land. However, the good fortune of the Club was short-lived towards the end of the 1920s. The Great Depression had begun, and the finances of the club were severely strained.

During the [[Japanese occupation of Singapore|Japanese occupation]], The Tanglin Club was used by the [[Imperial Japanese Army|Japanese army]] as a club for their officers. The club was also used as a base for their propaganda unit as well as their storage area for rations and weapons. After the Japanese surrender, The Tanglin Club came under the management of the [[Navy, Army and Air Force Institutes]] (NAAFI) until March 1946. It was not until 1 September 1946 that the club was informally reopened.

;The Post-War Period
The men who gathered in the dining room of the Singapore Club on 21 May 1946 faced a daunting task – to reinstate The Tanglin Club, an institution founded seventy-five years earlier as a premier establishment – like the ‘forty good men and true’ who had met in 1865. The dedication of the post-war committee paid off; despite the difficulties faced, the club reopened informally on 1 September 1946, with 182 Ordinary Members, including 127 pre-war registered members, 23 lady members and provision for up to 300 service members.

During the 1950s, the club consolidated its finances and continued to build up its membership. By September 1950, the membership stood at 1,309 – including 13 life and honorary members – and the waiting list was temporarily closed for the first time after the war.

The last significant event in the years leading to the centenary of The Tanglin Club in 1965 concerned the opening of membership. Although the rules of the club did not specifically deny membership on the grounds of race, but in practice, the club was British. In 1959, the elected government decided to eliminate the advantage enjoyed by citizens of the United Kingdom and British colonies in their eligibility for Singapore citizenship. An amended citizenship bill passed in May 1960 disallowed dual nationality and made the period of residence to qualify for Singapore citizenship eight years for all applicants, including British subjects.

;Change in Membership Rules
In 1962, the government appealed to clubs in Singapore to have at least 50% Singaporean membership. After an extraordinary general meeting, the club's membership rule was amended to admit all races. The first Singaporeans to join the club included Shaw Vee Meng, Dr Yeo Chee Peng, Tan Eng Han, Koh Eng Yam, U. S. Chan and C. K. Sng.

In 1971, the completion of the pull out of the British forces stationed in Singapore signalled the end of a tradition in membership and association extended by The Tanglin Club from its founding. At a special meeting of Members on 3 May 1973, the category of Service membership was deleted from the club rules. By October 1978, the membership stood at 2,561 with 498 on the waiting list.

Traditionally, women paid lower membership fees but were not given voting rights. It was only in April 1995 that women who were full members were accorded equal voting privileges in the club. Due to the club's constitution that capped Singaporean membership to 51%, the waiting time for Singaporeans has been known to be as long as 25 years.

;New Clubhouse
The construction of a new four-storey clubhouse was carried out in phases since September 1977 and was completed in March 1981. On 14 March 1981, members bade farewell to the original clubhouse at a closing ceremony. Before the old clubhouse was demolished, memorabilia from the old building were auctioned off in support of the Children's Charity Association of Singapore. More than a month later, on 25 April 1998, the present clubhouse was officially opened by the then [[Minister for Law (Singapore)|Minister for Law]] [[Edmund W. Barker|E. W. Barker]]. Over the years, the clubhouse had been upgraded to cater to members' needs. In 2005, the club embarked on a $21 million upgrading plan that included the construction of a new sports complex. The upgrading project is scheduled for completion in October 2007. In 2006, the club membership was 5,800, and it comprised 70 nationalities.

;Interment of the Time Capsule
During the 125th Anniversary celebrations of 1990, the then general committee carried out the interment of a time capsule. Containing various items of historical interest for future historians, the time capsule has rested undisturbed and shall not be opened till the 200th anniversary of the club in October 2065.

;150th Anniversary
To commemorate the Big 150, events and promotions in celebration of this momentous milestone were featured throughout the year.

On 9 October 2015, Children’s Day, the club hosted a poolside carnival for approximately 150 disadvantaged children. To make this event more special, Members kindly volunteered to lend a helping hand during the carnival. On the same day, the club held a specially commissioned 150th celebratory musical, ''‘The Tanglin Tree’'', composed by John Sharpley, with lyrics by Tanglin Club member Robert Yeo. Over forty artists joined hands to create this unique Tanglin production. In honour of the club’s official colour, a Club-wide celebration ''‘Hallow’green’'' on 31 October 2015 was thrown.

To commemorate the 150th anniversary, the then general committee members gathered for the planting of a tanglin tree at the poolside area on 14 December 2015.

The biggest milestone of the 150th Anniversary was the Charity Drive which raised a total of nearly $450,000, from members who generously contributed to this initiative. During the club’s Charity Black Tie Gala Dinner in November 2015, a cheque of $195,975 was presented to Singapore President Tony Tan for the President’s Challenge. By December 2015, the final donation to the President’s Challenge amounted to $220,625. $73,550 was donated to Food from the Heart; $73,550 was donated to the Kidney Dialysis Foundation; a donation of $73,525 was channelled to Focus on the Family Singapore. Aside from the Charity Drive, $5,762 was donated to the club’s adopted charity for 2015, Dover Park Hospice.

To thank the Tanglin Club members for their generosity during this Charity Drive, Singapore President Tony Tan presented a token of appreciation to Club President Robert Wiener during the Appreciation Night ‘Stories of Hope’ at the Istana on 27 January 2016. Club Vice-President Eugene Lim was also pleased to represent members to attend this joyous event.

;The Tanglin Club Today
Today, The Tanglin Club stands proud as one of Singapore's oldest and prominent social clubs. Exclusively available to its members, the club is an inviting oasis for relaxation and rejuvenation as its ambience still evokes the grace and charm of the past while reflecting its mission of being a "home away from home". Even more so today, The Tanglin Club with its strategic location, cosmopolitan membership and modern facilities, caters to the wants and desires of contemporary men and women.

'''Umar Marvi or Marui''' ({{lang-sd|عمر مارئي}}), ({{lang-ur|{{Nastaliq|'''عُمَر ماروی '''}}}}), is a folktale from [[Sindh]], [[Pakistan]] about a village girl Marvi Maraich, who resists the overtures of a powerful King and the temptation to live in the palace as a queen, preferring to be in simple rural environment with her own village folk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title=Popular Folk Stories: Umar Marui|author=Dr. N.

The story also appears in [[Shah Jo Risalo]] and forms part of seven popular tragic romances from [[Sindh]], [[Pakistan]]. The other six tales are ''[[Sassui Punnhun]]'', ''[[Sohni Mahiwal|Sohni Mehar]]'', ''[[Lilan Chanesar]]'', ''[[Noori Jam Tamachi]]'', ''[[Sorath Rai Diyach]]'' and ''[[Momal Rano]]'' commonly known as [[the Seven Queens of Sindh]], or the Seven heroines of [[Shah Abdul Latif Bhittai]].

==Folklore==
The story of Umar Marvi is that Marvi was a young [[Thari]] girl abducted by then-ruler of [[Amarkot]], Umar, who wanted to marry her because of her beauty. Upon her refusal she was imprisoned in the historic Umerkot Fort for several years. Because of her courage, Marvi is regarded as a symbol of love for one's soil and homeland.

==In popular culture==

* [[Pakistan Television Corporation]] ran a serial-adaptation called [[Marvi]] in 1993. The series depicts the story of Marvi and Umar in a modern setting. [[Ghazal Siddique]] played the title-role, while [[Hassam Qazi]] played Umer.

''' Umaru Abdulrahman Dikko''' (31 December 1936&lt;ref&gt;http://www.peoplesdailyng.com/second-republic-minister-umaru-dikko-dies-at-london-home/&lt;/ref&gt; – 1 July 2014) was a [[Nigerian]] [[politician]]. He was an adviser to President [[Shehu Shagari]] and served as [[Minister (government)|minister]] for [[transportation]] from 1979–1983.

Dikko was born in Wamba.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hP7jJAkTd9MC&amp;pg=PA161|title=An Encyclopedic Dictionary of Conflict and Conflict Resolution, 1945-1996|first=John E.|last=Jessup|date=3 August 1998|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|accessdate=3 August 2017|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; He started playing a role in the nation's governance in 1967, when he was appointed as a [[commissioner]] in the then ''North Central State of Nigeria'' (now [[Kaduna State]]).

A military coup on 31 December 1983, overthrew the government of Shagari. Dikko fled into exile in [[London]] as well as a few other ministers and party officials of the [[National Party of Nigeria]]. The new military regime accused him of large-scale corruption while in office, in particular of embezzling millions of dollars from the nation's oil revenues.

'''Vert Dider''' is a [[Nonprofit organization|non-profit]] [[Volunteering|volunteer]] project focused around translating and dubbing scientific and educational videos for Russian-speaking audience&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://elementy.ru/catalog/636/Studiya_perevodov_i_ozvuchivaniya_nauchno_populyarnykh_filmov_Vert_Dider_vertdider_com|title=Студия переводов и озвучивания научно-популярных фильмов «Vert Dider» • vertdider.com • Каталог научных и научно-популярных сайтов Рунета|website=elementy.ru|language=ru|access-date=2018-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

== History ==
The project was found in July, 2013. The studio is supported and developed by volunteers helping it evolve. The studio’s leading activity is translating and dubbing videos related to science&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;. Over a thousand videos are currently available through the studio’s official public page on [[VKontakte|VK social media site]]. The list of translated into Russian and dubbed videos include videos from a number of educational YouTube channels, lectures, debates and documentaries&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.aif.ru/society/education/uchitsya_po-vzroslomu_kakoe_besplatnoe_obrazovanie_mozhet_poluchit_moskvich|title=Учиться «по-взрослому».

On January 19, 2016, was the day when Vert Dider started cooperating with [[BuzzFeed]] media company&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://vk.com/wall-106782500_5302?hash=d5aa82cdc979ac527b|title=Сooperating with Vert Dider|last=|first=|date=|website=vk.com|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

In early 2017 Vert Dider started a YouTube channel for videos in English. That same year the studio joined efforts with the educational project SciOne to conduct interviews with [[Walter Lewin]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://aboutspacejornal.net/2018/02/02/%D1%83%D0%BE%D0%BB%D1%82%D0%B5%D1%80-%D0%BB%D0%B5%D0%B2%D0%B8%D0%BD-%D0%BE-%D1%84%D0%B8%D0%B7%D0%B8%D0%BA%D0%B5-%D0%B8%D1%81%D0%BA%D1%83%D1%81%D1%81%D1%82%D0%B2%D0%B5-%D1%81%D0%B5%D0%BA%D1%80%D0%B5/|title=Уолтер Левин о физике, искусстве, секретах преподавания и главных загадках Вселенной|date=2018-02-01|work=Журнал "Все о Космосе"|access-date=2018-04-09|language=ru-RU}}&lt;/ref&gt;, [[Robert Sapolsky]]&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://cmtscience.ru/article/robert-sapol-ski-o-nauke-morali-religii-i-biologii-povedeniya-cheloveka|title=Роберт Сапольски о науке, морали, религии и биологии поведения человека {{!}} CMT: Научный подход|website=cmtscience.ru|language=ru|access-date=2018-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;, [[Lawrence M.

The studio took on the task of spreading word about Robert Sapolsky throughout Russian-speaking audience. In 2017, the studio managed to arrange a long interview with Prof. Sapolsky&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;. With the studio’s information support, ''“[[A Primate's Memoir]]”'' by Sapolsky was published by “Alpina non-fiction” publishing house.

=== Cooperation with educational channels ===
The studio was allowed by a number of creators behind major educational channels to translate and dub their videos. The channels are listed below:

* [[Veritasium]] (since 2015)
* [[AsapScience]] (since 2015)
* [[MinutePhysics]] (since 2015)
* [[Fraser Cain]] (since 2017)

== Awards ==
In 2015, the studio was nominated as “The best online project about science” for an award "For Loyalty to Science" initiated by [[Ministry of Education and Science (Russia)|Ministry of Education and Science of the Russian Federation]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.truescience.ru/nomination|title=www.truescience.ru|last=|first=|date=|website=www.truescience.ru|language=ru|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150213170418/http://www.truescience.ru/nomination|archive-date=2015-02-13|dead-url=|access-date=2018-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://trv-science.ru/2015/02/24/za-vernost-nauke/|title=«За верность науке»: настоящее и будущее — Троицкий вариант — Наука|website=trv-science.ru|language=ru-RU|access-date=2018-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

'''Vietnamese people in Belgium''' or '''Vietnamese Belgian''' refers to people of [[Vietnam]]ese ancestry who were born in or immigrated to [[Belgium]]. The population of the community is about 14,000 as of 2012.

==History==
The first Vietnamese migrants to Belgium consisted of students and diplomats from [[South Vietnam]] beginning in 1965, when the South Vietnamese government sought for stronger relations with other [[Francophone]] nations following a minor rift with France. Belgium soon became a popular alternative to France for South Vietnamese students seeking higher education and career opportunities, especially in the cities of [[Brussels]], [[Liège]] and [[Leuven]].&lt;ref name="regard" /&gt;

A much larger influx of Vietnamese immigrants arrived as refugees following the [[Fall of Saigon]], beginning in 1978. Similarly to their [[Vietnamese people in France|counterparts in France]], South Vietnamese refugees to Belgium were largely of higher socioeconomic standing and integrated much easier into their host country's society due to better linguistic and cultural knowledge than their peers who settled in North America, Australia and the rest of Europe.&lt;ref&gt;[http://eglasie.mepasie.org/divers-horizons/1995-10-16-la-diaspora-vietnamienne-en-france-un-cas La Diaspora Vietnamienne en France un cas particulier] (in French)&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the fall of the [[Berlin Wall]] in 1989, a number of Vietnamese workers in former [[Soviet Bloc]] countries who were sponsored by the communist government of Vietnam sought asylum in Belgium. This included many guest workers in the former [[East Germany]] who were encouraged by the German government to be repatriated back to their home country following German reunification.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bui|p=17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Demographics and Culture==
A large proportion of the Vietnamese Belgian population resides in [[Brussels]] and the surrounding area, with a Vietnamese business district centered along [[Boulevard Anspach]]. The rest of the Vietnamese Belgian community is largely concentrated in the southern French-speaking [[Wallonia]] region, especially around the city of [[Liège]].&lt;ref name="regard" /&gt;

The Vietnamese community in Belgium maintains strong relations with its counterpart community in France. Before the establishment of Vietnamese businesses and community institutions in Belgium during the late 1970s, Vietnamese Belgians would travel to [[Paris]] for various purposes, such as buying Vietnamese grocery products and seeking immigrant needs.&lt;ref name="regard" /&gt;

In terms of religion, the vast majority of Vietnamese Belgians are at least nominal [[Buddhism|Buddhists]], following the [[Mahayana]] branch with influences from [[Confucianism|Confucian philosophy]]. The influx of Vietnamese immigrants into Belgium created a visible Buddhist community in the country, with temples serving as both spiritual and community centers, and have also attracted non-Vietnamese worshippers.&lt;ref&gt;Bernard De Backer, ''Bouddhismes en Belgiqu''e from ''Courrier hebdomadaire'', n°1768-1769, Centre de recherche et d'information socio-politiques, Bruxelles, 2002, pp. 5-70 {{ISSN|0008-9664}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Socioeconomics==
The Vietnamese community in Belgium is largely well-integrated into Belgian society. Among immigrants from the former South Vietnam, initial strong knowledge of the [[French language]] allowed them to pursue studies and careers despite their recent arrival. While some Vietnamese immigrants did settle in the [[Flanders]] region and learned [[Dutch language|Dutch]], most relocated to Brussels or Wallonia. Meanwhile, Belgian-born Vietnamese have extremely high rates of success in education, at many times outperforming their peers and having a high rate of enrollment in higher education.&lt;ref name="regard" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2153">'''Waikikamukau''' ({{IPAc-en|w|aɪ|k|ɪ|k|ɑː|m|uː|k|aʊ}}, as if saying "Why kick a moo-cow") is a generic name for a small rural [[town]] or locality in [[New Zealand]]. New Zealanders use the name as a [[placeholder name]] for "any town" or to denote a non-specific but remote rural town.  It has a similar connotation to the New Zealand slang Wop Wops&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

Waikikamukau is reputed to specifically refer to the town of [[Waipukurau]] in the North Island.  The origins are hazy but one account is that the American servicemen stationed in NZ during the [[Second World War]] found it difficult to pronounce the place name and thus jokingly called it Waikikamukau.

It was used as the name of a successful racehorse&lt;ref&gt;{{

Waikikamukau was also used as the setting for a [[Nickelodeon]] telemovie, ''[[Rocket Power: Race Across New Zealand]]''.

{{nihongo|The Sixth '''Yamaguchi-gumi'''|六代目山口組|extra={{IPA-ja|ɾokɯdaime jamagɯt͡ɕi gɯmi|lang}}|Rokudaime Yamaguchi-gumi}} is [[Japan]]'s largest ''[[yakuza]]'' organization. It is named after its founder [[Harukichi Yamaguchi]]. Its origins can be traced back to a loose [[labor union]] for dockworkers in [[Kobe]] before [[World War II]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.japanvisitor.com/japanese-culture/yamaguchi-gumi Yamaguchi-gumi: Japan's largest organized crime group | Japan Visitor&lt;/ref&gt;

It is one of the largest [[organized crime|criminal organizations]] in the world. According to the [[National Police Agency (Japan)|National Police Agency]], it had 20,400 active members and 18,600 associated members in 2007.&lt;ref name="NPAest"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.npa.go.jp/sosikihanzai/bouryokudan/boutai14/h19_bouryoku.pdf#page=6|page=3|script-title=ja:平成19年の暴力団情勢|publisher=National Police Agency|date=April 2008|language=Japanese|accessdate=March 23, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is, by far, the largest of the ''[[bōryokudan]]'' groups, and its membership encompasses roughly 45% of the 86,300 ''yakuza'' in the Japanese underworld. Leading members of the Yamaguchi-gumi number 102 people in total; 1 ''[[Oyabun#Structure|kumichō]]'' (組長; boss), 15 ''shatei'' (舎弟; younger brother) and 86 ''wakachū'' (若中; child) as of November 2005.

The Yamaguchi-gumi are among the world's wealthiest gangsters, bringing in billions of dollars a year from [[extortion]], [[gambling]], the [[prostitution|sex industry]], [[arms trafficking]], [[drug trafficking]], [[mortgage fraud|real estate]] and [[bid rigging|construction kickback]] schemes. They are also involved in [[securities fraud|stock market manipulation]] and [[Internet pornography]].

The Yamaguchi-gumi has its headquarters in Kobe, but it operates all across Japan and has overseas operations in the rest of [[Asia]] and the [[United States]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} Its current ''kumichō'' (Boss), [[Kenichi Shinoda|Shinobu Tsukasa]], has declared an expansionist policy—even making inroads into [[Tokyo]], traditionally not Yamaguchi turf.&lt;ref name="Bracing"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.msn.com/en-us/news/world/japanese-police-bracing-for-gang-war-as-yamaguchi-gumi-mafia-group-splits/ar-BBmbssC | title=Japanese police bracing for gang war as Yamaguchi-gumi mafia group splits | publisher=The Guardian via MSN | date=28 August 2015 | accessdate=28 August 2015 | author=McCurry, Justin}}&lt;/ref&gt; They also have multiple groups working overseas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/asia-pacific/6341253.stm|title=Tokyo death sparks gang war|publisher= [[BBC]]| date=February 8, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.worldnewsaustralia.com.au/region.php?id=136356&amp;region=2&lt;/ref&gt;

==Leadership==
*1st ''kumichō'' (1915–1925): [[Harukichi Yamaguchi]]&lt;ref name="Bracing"/&gt;
*2nd ''kumichō'' (1925–1942): [[Noboru Yamaguchi]]—son of Harukichi Yamaguchi
*3rd ''kumichō'' (1946–1981): [[Kazuo Taoka]]

When Taoka inherited the title of ''kumichō'', it was merely a local family with only a few dozen members. It was Taoka who made Yamaguchi-gumi the world's largest [[criminal organization]]. He urged his underlings to have legitimate businesses and allowed them to have their own family, which became a kind of subsidiary family of Yamaguchi-gumi. He also created a structural system in the family. ''Wakagashira'' were elected as underbosses to the ''kumichō'' and some of powerful members were elected as ''wakagashira-hosa'' (deputy underbosses).{{Citation needed|date=June 2007}}

*4th ''kumichō'' (1984–1985): [[Masahisa Takenaka]]

After the death of Taoka, the heir apparent ''wakagashira'' [[Kenichi Yamamoto (yakuza)|Kenichi Yamamoto]] (''kumichō'' of the [[Yamaken-gumi]]) was serving a prison sentence. He died of liver failure shortly afterward. Fumiko Taoka, Kazuo Taoka's wife, stepped forward to fill the leadership void until a new ''kumichō'' could be selected by a council of eight top-level bosses.
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Tsukasa Shinobu.jpg|thumb|left|180px|The current head, [[Shinobu Tsukasa]], is the founder of the [[Kodo-kai]], a [[Nagoya]]-based clan raised in the late 20th century.]] --&gt;
In 1984, the elders chose [[Masahisa Takenaka]] (''kumichō'' of the [[Takenaka-gumi]]) to be the fourth ''kumichō'' of Yamaguchi-gumi. One of the other contenders, [[Hiroshi Yamamoto (yakuza)|Hiroshi Yamamoto]] (''kumichō'' of the [[Yamahiro-gumi]]), broke away from Yamaguchi-gumi with many of its powerful members and more than 3,000 of its soldiers to form the [[Ichiwa-kai]]. A bitter rivalry existed between the two groups, which led to an all-out war (the [[Yama-Ichi War]]) after the Ichiwa-kai's 1985 assassination of Takenaka and ''wakahashira'' [[Katsumasa Nakayama]].  During the war, acting-''kumichō'' [[Kazuo Nakanishi]] (''kumichō'' of the [[Nakanishi-gumi]]) and ''wakagashira'' [[Yoshinori Watanabe]] (''kumichō'' of the Yamaken-gumi) briefly took the leadership role until 1989.

*5th ''kumichō'' (1989–2005): [[Yoshinori Watanabe]]
The Yama-Ichi War ended with retirement of Hiroshi Yamamoto which was arbitrated by one of the most respected bosses [[Seijo Inagawa]]. After that, the clan elected ''wakagashira'' Yoshinori Watanabe as 5th ''kumichō'' of the organization. [[Masaru Takumi]] (''kumichō'' of Takumi-gumi) was elected as ''wakagashira''. He was so powerful and respected within the organization that his influence overshadowed that of ''kumichō'' to some extent.

*6th ''kumichō'' (2005–present): [[Kenichi Shinoda|Shinobu Tsukasa]] (real name: Kenichi Shinoda)&lt;ref name="Bracing"/&gt;

In 1997, then powerful ''wakagashira'' Masaru Takumi was assassinated by underlings of then ''wakagashira-hosa'' (deputy underboss) [[Taro Nakano]]. After this assassination, they were unable to choose a new ''wakagashira'' for more than eight years. As a result, leadership of the organization became weaker. Finally, in 2005, ''wakagashira-hosa'' Shinobu Tsukasa (then ''kumichō'' of the Hirota-gumi) was chosen as new ''wakagashira'' and shortly afterward, in August 2005, Tsukasa inherited the position of the 6th ''kumichō'' of the Yamaguchi-gumi.

Watanabe retired to private life—rather uncommon in ''yakuza'' circles, as bosses usually do not retire until their death.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mdn.mainichi-msn.co.jp/waiwai/face/archive/news/2005/20050805p2g00m0dm010000c.html Mainichi Daily News ends its partnership with MSN, takes on new Web address&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Under Tsukasa's leadership, the 6th Yamaguchi-gumi has resumed expansion. [[Kiyoshi Takayama]], ''kumichō'' of the [[Kodo-kai]], was elected as ''wakagashira''. They absorbed the Tokyo-based gang [[Kokusui-kai]], thus acquiring lucrative turf in the capital. Tsukasa was imprisoned in December 2005 for illegal gun possession, and was released in April 2011 after serving nearly six years in jail.&lt;ref&gt;[http://search.japantimes.co.jp/member/member.html?nn20050819f3.htm Police wary as Yamaguchi-gumi prepares to fete sixth don | The Japan Times Online&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-pacific-13027109 Japan frees Yamaguchi-gumi crime boss Kenichi Shinoda | BBC News]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relief support after disasters==
Immediately after the [[Great Hanshin earthquake|Kobe earthquake]] of 1995, the Yamaguchi-gumi started a large-scale relief effort for the earthquake victims, helping with the distribution of food and supplies. This help was essential to the Kobe population, because official support was inconsistent and chaotic for several days.&lt;ref&gt;[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=990CE2DF1E31F931A15752C0A963958260 QUAKE IN JAPAN: GANGSTERS; Gang in Kobe Organizes Aid for People In Quake]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;YASUYUKI SAWADA, SATOSHI SHIMIZUTANI.

The Yamaguchi-gumi also provided relief in the wake of the [[2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami]] by opening its offices to the public and by sending supplies to affected areas.&lt;ref name="adelstein20110320"&gt;{{cite news | first = Jake | last = Adelstein | title = Yakuza to the Rescue | date = 2011-03-20 | publisher = The Newsweek / Daily Beast Company LLC | url = http://www.thedailybeast.com/blogs-and-stories/2011-03-18/japanese-yakuza-aid-earthquake-relief-efforts/ | work = The Daily Beast | accessdate = 2011-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Newsletter==
In an effort to boost morale, the Yamaguchi-gumi launched an eight-page newsletter in July, 2013. However, it was only distributed to full members. The publication bridges communication gaps and includes articles on the group's opinion and traditions, as well as columns on angling, with an editorial section written by [[Kenichi Shinoda]].&lt;ref name="investvine"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://investvine.com/japan-yakuza-how-about-your-mafia-magazines-asean/|title=Japan Yakuza: How about your Mafia Magazines, ASEAN?|first=Justin|last=Calderon|work=Investvine|date=12 July 2013|accessdate=28 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Assassination of Iccho Itoh==

On April 17, 2007, [[Tetsuya Shiroo]], a senior ranking member of the [[Suishin-kai]] (an affiliated Yakuza family to the Yamaguchi-gumi), assassinated [[Iccho Itoh]], the mayor of [[Nagasaki, Nagasaki|Nagasaki]], over an apparent dispute over damage done to Shiroo's car at a public works construction site.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/7202252.stm | work=BBC News | title=I killed mayor - Japan 'gangster' | date=January 22, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; On May 26, 2008, Tetsuya Shiroo was sentenced to death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,25197,23762086-2703,00.html | work=The Australian | first=Peter | last=Alford | title=Nagasaki mayor's yakuza killer to hang | date=May 27, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the Fukuoka High Court revoked the death sentence and sentenced him to life imprisonment on September 29, 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.straitstimes.com/Breaking%2BNews/Asia/Story/STIStory_435899.html|title=Gangster escapes gallows|publisher=Straits Times|date=2009-09-29|accessdate=2009-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sanctions==
In February 2012 the [[United States Department of the Treasury|U.S. Treasury Department]] announced a freeze on American-owned assets controlled by the organization and its top two leaders.&lt;ref name="wsj20120223"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052970203918304577241844134189560 | title=U.S. Imposes Sanctions on Japan Organized Crime Group | work=Wall Street Journal | date=2012-02-23 | accessdate=February 24, 2012 | author=Wakabayashi, Daisuke |author2=Jeff Bater }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Presidency of Barack Obama|Obama administration]] imposed sanctions on the Yamaguchi-gumi as one of four key [[transnational organized crime]] groups, along with the [[Brothers' Circle]] from [[Russia]], the [[Camorra]] from [[Italy]], and [[Los Zetas]] from [[Mexico]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Cohen|first=David|title=Combating Transnational Organized Crime|url=http://www.treasury.gov/connect/blog/Pages/Combating-Transnational-Organized-Crime.aspx|publisher=[[United States Department of the Treasury]]|accessdate=26 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Decline in membership==
''Yakuza'' membership has been steadily declining since the 1990s. According to the [[National Police Agency (Japan)|National Police Agency]], the total number of registered gangsters fell 14% between 1991 and 2012, to 78,600.&lt;ref name="GuardYak"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/feb/24/united-states-offensive-japan-yakuza|title=US steps up offensive against Japan's yakuza gangs}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of those, 34,900 were Yamaguchi-gumi members, a decline of 4% from 2010.&lt;ref name="GuardYak"/&gt; Its membership had further declined by 2013, with an estimated 28,000 members,&lt;ref name="investvine"/&gt; and dropped again to 23,400 members in 2014.&lt;ref name="WSJSplit"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://blogs.wsj.com/japanrealtime/2015/08/28/top-yakuza-group-yamaguchi-gumi-shows-signs-of-split/ | title=Top Yakuza Group, Yamaguchi-gumi, Shows Signs of Split | publisher=Wall Street Journal | date=August 28, 2015 | accessdate=September 1, 2015 | author=Hongo, Jun}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Split in 2015==
On August 27, 2015, Japanese police confirmed that powerful factions, including Kobe-based [[Yamaken-gumi]], Osaka-based [[Takumi-gumi]], and [[Kyoyu-kai]], broke away from Yamaguchi-gumi and formed a new group called [[Kobe Yamaguchi-gumi]].&lt;ref name="AJWSplit"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://ajw.asahi.com/article/behind_news/social_affairs/AJ201508280033 | title=Police brace for yakuza war after Yamaguchi-gumi splits up | publisher=The Asahi Shimbun | date=August 28, 2015 | accessdate=September 1, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.latimes.com/world/asia/la-fg-japan-police-yakuza-group-split-20150829-story.html | title=Japan's police on alert in wake of reported yakuza group split | publisher=Los Angeles Times | date=September 1, 2015 | accessdate=September 1, 2015 | author=Adelstein, Jake}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to the split, the organisation consisted of seventy-two factions.&lt;ref&gt;http://edition.cnn.com/2015/09/15/asia/yakuza-yamaguchi-gumi-explainer/index.html&lt;/ref&gt; This was the first major split since the forming of Ichiwa-Kai more than thirty years ago.
