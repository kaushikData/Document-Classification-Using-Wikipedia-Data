'''826NYC''' is a [[nonprofit]] organization located in [[Park Slope]], [[Brooklyn]]. It provides free after-school tutoring, workshops, in-schools tutoring, help for English language learners, and assistance with student publications. Drawing from a volunteer base of over 2,000, which includes many teachers, writers and journalism professionals, 826NYC unites students with tutors.  It is a chapter of [[826 National]].
__NOTOC__
==Facade==
[[Image:BSHS Sign Front.jpg|thumb|Detail of sign at the store's entrance.]]

826NYC is located in a "secret lair" behind '''The Brooklyn Superhero Supply Company''',&lt;ref&gt;http://www.superherosupplies.com&lt;/ref&gt; a store similar in eccentricity to [[826 Valencia]]’s storefront pirate shop, and which sells capes, grappling hooks, utility belts (new and vintage), masks, tights, deflector bracelets, bottles of chaos and anti-gravity, secret identity kits, and more.  Visitors to the store can try out capes for free in a cape-testing wind tunnel (essentially a series of fans on a pedestal).  The store sells new and back issues of ''[[Timothy McSweeney's Quarterly Concern]]'', [[The Believer (magazine)|''The Believer'']], ''[[Wholphin (DVD)|Wholphin]],'' and other McSweeney's publications. The Brooklyn Superhero Supply Co. also carries a complete stock of publications written and edited by students at 826NYC including ''Trapped: The Encyclopedia of Escape'', ''Sonny Paine'', and issues 1 and 2 of ''The 826NYC Review''.  The store front is literally a front for the charitable organization, with all sales going to the organization.  The store employs volunteers.

The design of the store features many tongue-in-cheek signs and features, and the staff treat their products as real super-hero supplies, and visitors as real super-heroes.  The secret lair to the student learning and activity center lies behind a swinging bookcase.

== Events ==
{{uncited section|date=August 2015}}
826NYC is known for hosting culturally innovative fundraising events.  In August 2006, 826NYC was the starting point for the Revenge Of The Book Eaters Tour, which stopped in each of the six cities home to an 826 National center.  The NYC stop, at The Beacon Theater, featured performances by [[Jon Stewart]], [[David Byrne]], [[Sufjan Stevens]], [[Dave Eggers]], [[Sarah Vowell]], [[John Hodgman]], [[Eric Bogosian]], [[Jonathan Coulton]], and [[John Roderick (musician)|John Roderick]] in an evening that promised once and for all to settle the debate: words or music–which is better?

Other 826NYC fundraising events have included 826NYC Art Show (curated by [[Marcel Dzama]], [[Shelley Dick]], and [[David Zwirner Gallery]]), 826NYC Fashion Show/Spring 2006 Collection (featuring crimefighting-wear designed by [[Marc Jacobs]], [[Zac Posen]], [[Jack Spade]], [[Behnaz Sarafpour]], Rebecca Taylor, [[Kenneth Cole (designer)|Kenneth Cole]], and Benjamin Cho, modeled by [[The Daily Show]] correspondents [[Kathleen Hanna]] and [[Amy Sedaris]]), McSweeney's vs. They Might Be Giants (based on Issue #6 of McSweeneys, held at Lincoln Center), How I Learned To Read (Eric Bogosian, Bob Balaban, [[Cynthia Nixon]], [[Justin Theroux]], [[Sam Rockwell]], [[Philip Seymour Hoffman]], [[Martha Plimpton]], and [[Kristen Johnston]] read their favorite classic children's stories).

The '''American Choral Directors Association (ACDA)''', headquartered in [[Oklahoma City, Oklahoma|Oklahoma City]], [[Oklahoma]], is a non-profit organization with the stated purpose of promoting excellence in the field of [[choral music]].  Its membership comprises approximately 22,000 choral directors representing over a million singers.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}

==Background information==
ACDA is organized in seven Divisions, i.e., Central, Eastern, North Central, Northwestern, Southern, Southwestern, and Western.  Every year, conferences with topics pertaining to choral conductors are held - in even numbered years, a division conference is held in each division, and in odd numbered years, a national conference takes place in a major U.S. city.  In 2009, ACDA celebrated its 50th Anniversary in Oklahoma City; in 2011, the national conference was held in Chicago, Illinois. The 2013 national conference was held in Dallas, Texas. James Madison University was the host for the national chapter for 2011.  Each year a different university hosts the yearly ACDA chapter.

Conductors can apply to have their choirs perform at these conferences through a [[blind audition]]-CD process.  Being accepted to sing at an ACDA conference is considered a great honor, both for a choir and for its conductor.  Individual singers may also apply to sing with ACDA National or Regional Honor Choirs.  About 300 singers are selected from around the country to sing in each national or regional choir.

Their official publications are the ''[[Choral Journal]]'', as well as the scientific research journal ''[[International Journal of Research in Choral Singing]]'' (online only).

In addition to the division organization, a similar break out is done along specialization
lines.  The specialties are:{{citation needed|date=February 2012}}
*Boychoirs  
*Children's Choirs  
*College and University Choirs  
*Community Choirs 
*Ethnic and Multicultural Perspectives  
*Jazz Choirs  
*Junior High &amp; Middle School Choirs  
*Male Choirs  
*Music in Worship  
*Show Choirs  
*Senior High School Choirs  
*Two-Year College Choirs  
*Women's Choirs  
*Youth &amp; Student Activities

Each specialty is organized under a Repertoire and Standards (R&amp;S) Committee system, with a National Committee, Division Committees, and State chairpersons.  The National Chairperson for each specialty is also a member of the National R&amp;S Committee which meets annually to discuss issues common to all specialties.{{citation needed|date=February 2012}}

== Brock Commission ==
Since 1991, the ACDA awards the "Raymond W. Brock Memorial Commission" to "a recognized composer to write a choral composition in an effort to perpetuate quality choral repertoire."&lt;ref name=Brock&gt;{{cite web |url=http://acda.org/page.asp?page=brock_pieces |title=American Choral Directors Association |publisher=Acda.org |date= |accessdate=2017-02-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160308063227/http://www.acda.org/page.asp?page=brock_pieces |archivedate=2016-03-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6790">[[File:Royal Scottish Academy, Princes Street Edinburgh.jpg|thumb|The Royal Institution, Edinburgh (now the [[Royal Scottish Academy building]]), was commissioned and owned by the Board of Manufactures. It served as the head office of the Board from 1826 until its demise in 1906, and as home to several learned societies.]]

During the [[Scottish Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] and the [[industrial revolution]], Scottish [[industrial policy]] was made by the '''Board of Trustees for Fisheries, Manufactures and Improvements in Scotland''', which sought to build an economy complementary, not competitive, with England. Since England had woollens, this meant linen.

The Board was established in 1727, with the purpose of dispersing [[Government grant|grants]] to encourage the growth of the [[Fishing in Scotland|fishing]] and manufacturing industries.&lt;ref name="NAS"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nas.gov.uk/guides/scottishGovernmentAfter1707.asp|title=Scottish government records after 1707|year=2006|publisher=[[The National Archives of Scotland]]|accessdate=20 November 2011|location=Edinburgh}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When [[state regulation]] of the linen industry was abolished in 1823, the focus of the board turned to the [[decorative arts]] and the improvement of [[fine arts]] education. The Board had established the [[Trustees Drawing Academy of Edinburgh]] in 1760, to improve [[industrial design]], and in 1906 the Board's remaining functions were transferred to the Trustees of the [[National Galleries of Scotland]] by the National Galleries of Scotland Act.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Edw7/6/50/enacted | title = National Galleries of Scotland Act 1906 | accessdate = 2012-12-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Linen industry==
The linen industry was Scotland's premier industry in the 18th century and formed the basis for the later cotton, jute,&lt;ref&gt;Louise Miskell and C. A. Whatley, "'Juteopolis' in the Making: Linen and the Industrial Transformation of Dundee, c. 1820-1850," ''[[Textile History]],'' Autumn 1999, vol. 30 (2), pp. 176–98.&lt;/ref&gt; and woollen industries.&lt;ref&gt;Alastair J. Durie, "The Markets for Scottish Linen, 1730-1775," ''Scottish Historical Review'' vol. 52, no. 153, Part 1 (April, 1973), pp. 30–49 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/25528985 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;

Encouraged and subsidized by the Board of Trustees so it could compete with German products, merchant entrepreneurs became dominant in all stages of linen manufacturing and built up the market share of Scottish linens, especially in the American colonial market.&lt;ref&gt;Alastair Durie, "Imitation in Scottish Eighteenth-Century Textiles: The Drive to Establish the Manufacture of Osnaburg Linen," ''Journal of Design History,'' 1993, vol. 6 (2), pp. 71–6.&lt;/ref&gt; The British Linen Company, established in 1746, was the largest firm in the Scottish linen industry in the 18th century, exporting linen to England and America. As a joint-stock company, it had the right to raise funds through the issue of promissory notes or bonds. With its bonds functioning as bank notes, the company gradually moved into the business of lending and discounting to other linen manufacturers, and in the early 1770s banking became its main activity. Renamed the [[British Linen Bank]] in 1906, it was one of Scotland's premier banks until it was bought out by the Bank of Scotland in 1969.&lt;ref&gt;C. A. Malcolm, ''The History of the British Linen Bank'' (1950).&lt;/ref&gt; It joined the established Scottish banks such as the [[Bank of Scotland]] (Edinburgh, 1695) and the [[Royal Bank of Scotland]] (Edinburgh, 1727).&lt;ref&gt;R. Saville, ''Bank of Scotland: a History, 1695-1995'' (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press 1996), {{ISBN|0-7486-0757-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Glasgow would soon follow and Scotland had a flourishing financial system by the end of the century. There were over 400 branches, amounting to one office per 7000 people, double the level in England. The banks were more lightly regulated than those in England. Historians often emphasise that the flexibility and dynamism of the Scottish banking system contributed significantly to the rapid development of the economy in the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;M. J. Daunton, ''Progress and Poverty: An Economic and Social History of Britain 1700-1850'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1995), {{ISBN|0-19-822281-5}}, p. 344.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;T. Cowen and R. Kroszner, "Scottish Banking before 1845: A Model for Laissez-Faire?", ''Journal of Money, Credit and Banking'', vol. 21, (2), (May, 1989), pp. 221–31 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1992370 in JSTOR].&lt;/ref&gt;

Centennial of Flight Commission ("CoFC" or "CofF Commission")''' was created in 1999, by the U.S. Congress, to serve as a national and international source of information about activities commemorating the [[centennial]] of the [[Wright brothers|Wright Brothers']] first powered flight on December 17, 1903 (purportedly the first fully controlled, sustained, powered flight of a heavier-than-air man-carrying [[airplane]]).&lt;ref name="uscofc_review_ncase"&gt;Review: [http://aviationeducation.org/government/item/u-s-centennial-of-flight-commission "U.

There were centennial commemorations and celebrations planned in 2003 to occur in both:
* [[North Carolina]] (the Wrights' 1903 powered flights took place on the sands at [[Kitty Hawk, North Carolina]]);&lt;ref name="uscofc_review_ncase" /&gt;&lt;ref name="release_01_227_cof_nasa_2001_11_20" /&gt; and 
* [[Dayton, Ohio]], hometown of the Wright brothers.&lt;ref name="uscofc_review_ncase" /&gt;

In addition, the commission anticipated numerous historical and educational projects about aviation and aeronautics nationally and internationally, and sought to be a shaping force in those events.&lt;ref name="release_01_227_cof_nasa_2001_11_20" /&gt;&lt;ref name="about_the_commission_cof_net"&gt;{{cite web|title=Commission Roles and Responsibilities|url=http://www.centennialofflight.gov/about/roles.htm|publisher=US Centennial of Flight Commission|accessdate=5 December 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121009204541/http://www.centennialofflight.gov/about/roles.htm|archivedate=9 October 2012}} {{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Commission coordinated a national outreach campaign, ''"Centennial of Flight: Born of Dreams — Inspired by Freedom,"'' "to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the Wright brothers’ first powered flight and the century of accomplishments that followed." The Commission also advised the President, Congress and federal agencies on the most effective ways to encourage and promote national and international participation in the commemoration.&lt;ref name="release_03_129_cof_nasa_2003_04_02" /&gt; The CoFC also undertook additional efforts to support Centennial commemorations and celebrations, and related educational and cultural programs, through its alliance with "Centennial Partners" who were "planning everything from cross-country tours to air shows and exhibitions, seminars and television specials." It also sponsored a large educational Centennial website.&lt;ref name="about_the_commission_cof_net" /&gt;

==Authorization and mission==
In 1998, the [[United States Congress]] passed the [[Centennial of Flight Commemoration Act]], Public Law 105-389, [[105th Congress]] (Nov. 13, 1998), as amended by Public Law 106-68, [[106th Congress]] (Oct. 6, 1999).&lt;ref name="about_the_commission_cof_net" /&gt;&lt;ref name="bill_hr5077_19940922_congress_gov"&gt;Hall, Tony P. Rep. [D-OH-3] Bill: [https://www.congress.gov/bill/103rd-congress/house-bill/5077 "H.R.5077 - Centennial of Flight Commemoration Act,"] Introduced 09/22/1994, [[U.S. House of Representatives]] of the [[103rd Congress]] (1993-1994), retrieved December 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

Regulations for the Commission were incorporated into the [[Code of Federal Regulations]] as "67 FR 758 - U_S_ Centennial of Flight Commission."&lt;ref name="67_fr_758_at_gpo"&gt;[https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/search/pagedetails.action?granuleId=02-316&amp;packageId=FR-2002-01-07&amp;acCode=FR&amp;collectionCode=FR "67 FR 758 - U_S_ Centennial of Flight Commission.htm"], [[Government Printing Office]], retrieved December 4, 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

The Commission had limited authority and resources, and was chiefly charged by Congress to play the leading role in coordinating and publicizing activities celebrating the achievements of [[Wright brothers|Wilbur and Orville Wright]] and commemorate a century of powered flight.&lt;ref name="about_the_commission_cof_net" /&gt;

The Commission's primary responsibilities were:
*To generate publicity for the celebration

*To give advice and recommendations to individuals and organizations conducting commemorative activities
*To maintain a Web site and a national calendar of events
*To send representatives to international meetings
*To maintain a speakers bureau
*To supervise staff operations 
*To sponsor meetings&lt;ref name="about_the_commission_cof_net" /&gt;

==Funding==
From FY1999 through FY2001, the Commission was funded through specific line-items in the [[Federal Aviation Administration]] operations appropriations. In subsequent years, the Commission was funded through general agency appropriations. The Centennial of Flight Commission, are provided with the authority to accept only nonmonetary donations. In that instance, the statutory language stated,
Donations.
:''The Commission may accept donations of personal services and historic materials relating to the implementation of its responsibilities under the provisions of this Act.''&lt;ref&gt;Glassman, Matthew E. and Jacob R.

* The [[Challenger Center]]—which uses space as a theme to excite, inspire and encourage students in the study of mathematics and science, and the application of technology. CofC's alliance was to have the Challenger Center, via [[Space Day]] 2003(SM), challenge students, in grades four through eight, "to design and build models of aircraft using the ingenuity and creativity of the Wrights as inspiration."&lt;ref name="release_01_176_cof_nasa_2002_09_17" /&gt;
* The [[Aviation Foundation of America]], Inc., to sponsor the re-creation of the [[National Air Tour]]s of the 1920s and 1930s—with dozens of vintage aircraft to fly the 1932 National Air Tour route that had been planned, but was never flown, around the U.S. heartland.&lt;ref name="release_01_176_cof_nasa_2002_09_17" /&gt;
* The [[Chicago Centennial of Flight Commission]] (CCFC) organized by a group of aviation industry organizations from the [[Chicago]] area, and the [[Great Lakes region]], to promote aviation awareness using public exhibits. It planned centennial activities including a model-airplane exhibit, at Chicago's [[Museum of Science and Industry (Chicago)|Museum of Science and Industry]], in 2003, from May to September, titled ''"Chicago Centennial of Flight: 100 History-Making Aircraft"''—plus "events and symposia throughout 2003," with hopes of also producing programs promoting aviation education for [[elementary school|elementary]] and [[secondary school|secondary]] school students.&lt;ref name="release_01_176_cof_nasa_2002_09_17" /&gt;

==Programs and Events==
In addition to the programs and events noted in the [[#Members and Participants]] section, the CoFC was involved with numerous other activities.

The '''National Centennial of Flight Kick-off''' event, was held December 17, 2002—a year before the 100th anniversary of the Wright flight—at the [[Smithsonian Institution]]'s [[National Air and Space Museum]], in [[Washington, D.C.]]. It included a Presidential proclamation and the recognition of numerous aviation and aerospace pioneers, with presentations from Chairman Dailey, actor/aviator [[John Travolta]], FAA Administrator [[Marion Blakey]], and NASA Administrator [[Sean O'Keefe]]. On the same day, in North Carolina, a commemoration was held near Kitty Hawk—a daylong anniversary tribute at the site of the Wrights' first flight, the Wright Brothers National Memorial, at Kill Devil Hills. Speakers included North Carolina Governor [[Michael F. Easley]] and [[U.S. Air Force]] Gen. Ralph E. Eberhart, commander of [[North American Aerospace Defense Command]] and [[U.S. Northern Command]]&lt;ref name="cof_calendar_kickoff_cof_net" /&gt;&lt;ref name="centennial_kickoff_2002_12_17_cspan_org"&gt;VIDEO: [https://www.c-span.org/video/?174275-1/centennial-flight ''Centennial of Flight,'']"...a ceremony..."

Numerous other commemoration events, and related projects, were urged, planned or supported throughout the nation, throughout the "centennial year" (December 17, 2002 to December 17, 2003), particularly in [[Ohio]] and [[North Carolina]].&lt;ref name="release_01_227_cof_nasa_2001_11_20" /&gt;&lt;ref name="cof_calendar_cof_net" /&gt;

The principal, and "grand finale," '''First Flight Centennial Celebration''' was held December 12–17, 2003, at the [[Wright Brothers National Memorial]] at the approximate site of their first powered flight at [[Kill Devil Hills, North Carolina]]. President [[George W. Bush]] was present, and numerous military and civilian aircraft performed. The event was marred by foul weather, and failed attempts to fly a replica of the [[1903 Wright Flyer]].&lt;ref name="centennial_ceremony_2003_12_17_cspan_org"&gt;VIDEO: [https://www.c-span.org/video/?179551-1/flight-centennial-ceremony ''First Flight Centennial Ceremony,''] December 17, 2003, [[C-SPAN]], retrieved December 2017&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="first flight_2003_12_18_washpost"&gt;Ruane.

==Website==
One of the Centennial of Flight Commission's principal efforts was the development of the organization's ''Centennial of Flight'' website&lt;ref name="release_01_227_cof_nasa_2001_11_20" /&gt;—a 17,000-page online encyclopedia of aviation history (chiefly U.S. aviation history), with hundreds of articles, and thousands of illustrations. The Commission claimed the website provided "the most up-to-date information on celebration activity, as well as the most comprehensive collection of outstanding educational essays, multimedia and links regarding the history of flight."&lt;ref name="about_the_commission_cof_net" /&gt;&lt;ref name="aahs_moves_2013_3rd_qtr_aahs_flightline" /&gt;

The site's development and operation consumed about four-million dollars, of mostly federal funds, but became very popular during the Centennial year, peaking at over 4 million visitors per month by December 2003 (the 100th Anniversary month).&lt;ref name="aahs_moves_2013_3rd_qtr_aahs_flightline" /&gt;

The site was maintained at the internet domain '''centennialofflight.gov'''&lt;ref name="release_01_227_cof_nasa_2001_11_20" /&gt; by NASA. Following the closing of the CoFC in April 2004, responsibility for the site transferred to the NASA History Office, who maintained the site online, basically unchanged, until budget cutbacks and server-computer problems motivated its abandonment by NASA in September 2012. Various parties salvaged parts of the site, including the [[American Aviation Historical Society]] (AAHS), who acquired copies of the computer code for the site from NASA. In 2013, a member of AAHS donated the domain name '''[http://centennialofflight.net/ centennialofflight.net]'''to AAHS, to accommodate an archive—maintained by AAHS—of the original official Centennial of Flight website. AAHS made structural "clean-ups" to the site (removing broken [[hyperlinks|links]] and obsolete calendar data), and initiating other edits, highlighted with dark red lettering.&lt;ref name="about_the_commission_cof_net" /&gt;&lt;ref name="aahs_moves_2013_3rd_qtr_aahs_flightline" /&gt;&lt;ref name="uscofc_review_ncase" /&gt;

==Termination==
The Commission closed in 2004, following the end of its scheduled functions. As part of the Commission's charter, there were provisions for certain material to be preserved, particularly the large website, which was assigned to the NASA History Office.&lt;ref name="about_the_commission_cof_net" /&gt;&lt;ref name="aahs_moves_2013_3rd_qtr_aahs_flightline" /&gt;

[[File:Chahar bagh school drawing.jpg|thumb|200px|right|19th century drawing of the school by French architect [[Pascal Coste]]]]
'''Chahār Bāgh''' school (''Madreseye Chahār Bāgh'' in [[Persian language|Persian]] or مدرسه چهار باغ
), also known as Shah school, is a 17-18th century cultural complex in [[Isfahan]], [[Iran]].

The compound was built during the time of [[Husayn (Safavid)|Soltan Hossein]], a [[Safavid]] king, to serve as a theological and clerical school to train those who were interested in such sciences. In order to finance the school, Soltan Hossein's mother had a large caravansary built nearby, the income of which went to the foundation. The monumental portal from the main avenue of Shah Abbas leads directly into a domed octagonal vestibule. The dome and the greater part of the walls are covered in bright yellow bricks which give a feeling of lightness. The entrance gate decorated with gold facade and silver, and the tile-works inside the building are masterpieces of fine art and industry. The central court, with its pool and garden, are surrounded by arcades on two levels, each giving access to a student's room.

Chulalongkorn University is a comprehensive and research-intensive university. It is ranked as the best university in Thailand in many surveys,&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.topuniversities.com/university-rankings/world-university-rankings/2016|title=QS World University Rankings 2016|date=2016-08-25|access-date=2016-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; quality of students,&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; quality of research,&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; quality in particular subjects,&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; university reputation,&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; environmental management systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://greenmetric.ui.ac.id/ranking-by-campus-setting-city-center2016/|title=Ranking By Campus Setting – City Center 2016 {{!}} Greenmetric UI|website=greenmetric.ui.ac.id|language=en-US|access-date=2017-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[QS World University Rankings|QS world university ranking]] 2017, CU is placed  245th in the world, 45th in Asia, 1st in Thailand, and 201-250 in the world graduate employability ranking. It is also ranked as Thailand's No. 1 university from various organizers such as Center for World University Rankings,  [[Round University Ranking|Round university ranking]], [[Academic Ranking of World Universities]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":14"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://shanghairanking.com/World-University-Rankings-2017/Thailand.html|title=World University Rankings - 2017 {{!}} Thailand Universities in Top 500 universities {{!}} Academic Ranking of World Universities - 2017 {{!}} Shanghai Ranking - 2017|website=shanghairanking.com|access-date=2017-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chulalongkorn University is one of the National Research Universities and supported by the Office of Nation Education Standards and Quality Assessment of Thailand. Moreover, CU is the only Thai university which is a member of [[Association of Pacific Rim Universities]] (APRU).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://apru.org/members/member-universities|title=Association of Pacific Rim Universities - Member Universities|website=apru.org|language=en-gb|access-date=2017-09-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Admission to CU is highly selective, and applicants are required to have high test scores. Applicants ranking in the top 10 national scores are chosen for study at CU.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.chula.ac.th/en/archive/857|title=Top Admission Score Students Apply to Chulalongkorn University|access-date=2017-09-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

CU is composed of nineteen faculties, a School of Agriculture, three colleges, ten institutes and two other schools. Its campus occupies a vast area in downtown [[Bangkok]]. Graduates customarily receive their diplomas from the [[Monarchy of Thailand|King of Thailand]], a tradition begun by King [[Prajadhipok]] (Rama VII).

==History==
[[File:King Chulalongkorn as Field Marshal.jpg|150px|thumb|left|The university was named after King Chulalongkorn]]
[[File:CUMonument56.JPG|thumbnail|right|200px|Statues of King Chulalongkorn and King Vajiravudh]]

King Chulalongkorn's reforms, aimed at transforming Thai society into a modern state demanded trained officials specialized in various fields. In 1899, the king founded the "Civil Service Training School"&lt;ref&gt;{{lang-th|โรงเรียนสำหรับฝึกหัดวิชาข้าราชการฝ่ายพลเรือน}}&lt;/ref&gt; near the north gate of the [[Grand Palace, Bangkok|Royal Palace]]. Those who graduated from the school would become royal pages. As royal pages, they learned how to manage organizations by working closely with the king, which was a traditional way to enter the Siamese bureaucracy. After serving as royal pages, they would then serve in the [[Ministry of Interior (Thailand)|Mahattai Ministry]] or other government ministries.

On 1 April 1902 the king renamed the school. It became the "Royal Pages School" ({{lang-th|โรงเรียนมหาดเล็ก}}).&lt;ref&gt;ราชกิจจานุเบกษา, [http://www.ratchakitcha.soc.go.th/DATA/PDF/2445/001/16.PDF พระบรมราชโองการประกาศตั้งโรงเรียนมหาดเล็ก]. เล่ม ๑๙, ตอน ๑, ๖ เมษายน พ.ศ.๒๔๔๕, หน้า ๑๖ (Royal Order to establish Royal Page School)&lt;/ref&gt; On 1 January 1911, King Vajiravudh changed the name to "Civil Service College of King Chulalongkorn" ({{lang-th|โรงเรียนข้าราชการพลเรือนของพระบาทสมเด็จพระจุลจอมเกล้าเจ้าอยู่หัว}}) as a memorial to his father and moved the school to [[Windsor Palace (Thailand)|Windsor Palace]] ({{lang-th|วังวินด์เซอร์ หรือวังใหม่}}) in the Pathumwan District.&lt;ref&gt;ราชกิจจานุเบกษา, [http://www.ratchakitcha.soc.go.th/DATA/PDF/2453/A/123.PDF พระบรมราชโองการประกาศตั้งโรงเรียนข้าราชการพลเรือนฯ ], เล่ม ๒๗, ตอน ก, ๑๑ มกราคม พ.ศ.๒๔๕๔, หน้า ๑๒๓ (Royal Order to establish the Civil Service College of King Chulalongkorn)&lt;/ref&gt;

The king subsidized the construction of a university campus and organized various schools around the city into Chulalongkorn. The college offered eight majors taught by five schools including;

* School of International Relations in the Royal Palace
* [[Faculty of Education, Chulalongkorn University|School of Teacher Training at Baan Somdet Chao Phraya]]
* [[Faculty of Medicine Siriraj Hospital, Mahidol University|Royal Medical College]] at Siriraj Hospital
* School of Legal Studies
* School of Mechanical Sciences at Windsor Palace

[[File:Main auditorium of Chulalongkorn University IMG 0338.jpg|250px|thumb|left|Chulalongkorn University Auditorium]]

King Rama VI realized that education should be provided not only to bureaucrats, but to all people. On 26 March 1917, the college was upgraded to "Chulalongkorn University" ({{lang-th|จุฬาลงกรณ์มหาวิทยาลัย}}),&lt;ref&gt;ราชกิจจานุเบกษา, [http://www.ratchakitcha.soc.go.th/DATA/PDF/2460/A/20.PDF พระบรมราชโองการ ประกาศประดิษฐานโรงเรียนข้าราชการพลเรือนของพระบาทสมเด็จพระจุลจอมเกล้าเจ้าอยู่หัวขึ้นเป็นโรงเรียนข้าราชการพลเรือน], เล่ม ๒๗, ตอน ก, ๑๕ เมษายน พ.ศ.๒๔๖๐ (ประกาศเมื่อวันที่ ๒๖ มีนาคม พ.ศ.๒๔๖๐, หน้า ๑๒๓ (Royal Order to establish the Civil Service College of King Chulalongkorn.)&lt;/ref&gt; and the schools were transformed into four faculties: Faculty of Arts and Sciences, Faculty of Public Administration, Faculty of Engineering, and Faculty of Medicine.

The [[Rockefeller Foundation]] reorganized the curriculum of the Faculty of Medicine. In 1923, the Faculty of Medicine became the first faculty to accept secondary school ([[Mattayom]]) graduates. The remaining faculties then followed suit. After the [[Siamese Revolution of 1932|1932 Revolution]], the [[Khana Ratsadon|People's Party]] wanted legal and political studies to be independent of "royalists" so they moved the Faculty of Law and Political Science to the new [[Thammasat University]] in 1933.

In 1938, Chulalongkorn University's Preparatory School was founded to provide pre-collegiate education to students. Those who managed to enter the university had to spend two years in the [[University-preparatory school|Preparatory School]] before going on to the Faculty of Arts and Sciences. The Preparatory School, however, ceased to be a university-owned preparatory school in 1947 and became the independent [[Triam Udom Suksa School]]. Later, the university established Chulalongkorn University Demonstration School (CUD) as a laboratory school for primary and secondary education for the Faculty of Education.

===Phra Kiao===
{{see main|Phra Kiao}}
[[File:Prakiow.jpg|thumbnail|280px|Pra Kiao model, CU Museum]]
Since the establishment of the Royal Pages School, the former name of the university, King Chulalongkorn authorized the use of his personal emblem as a school emblem.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chula.ac.th/about/symbol_prakew/index.htm About Phra Kiao by Chulalongkorn Memorial Hall] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110607024401/http://www.chula.ac.th/about/symbol_prakew/index.htm |date=June 7, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The emblem is called ''Phra Kiao'', a Thai [[coronet]], royal headgear for young princes and princesses. As the school was transformed into the university, the king authorized the use of ''phra kiao''. Today, ''phra kiao'' appears not only in formal letters and transcripts, but also on souvenirs made by the university as well as student uniforms.

===Student uniform===
Undergraduates are required to wear a uniform when studying, taking examinations, or contacting the university in person. Male graduate students wear a collared or polo shirt and dark trousers. Women wear a plain blouse with long skirt.

Originally, the university uniform was adapted from a uniform worn by Chulalongkorn's heirs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.discipline.studentaffairs.chula.ac.th/nisit_intro.html History about CU uniform.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100520023903/http://www.discipline.studentaffairs.chula.ac.th/nisit_intro.html |date=20 May 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The uniform was later updated, but the original is reserved as a formal uniform. The formal uniform is usually worn by student leaders and graduates.

Today, the ordinary uniform for male undergraduate students consists of a plain white shirt with long or short sleeves and black (or dark blue) trousers. Wearing a dark blue necktie with colored ''phra kiao'' engraved on its front is mandatory for first-year students but optional for higher years. However, a black tie with a silver ''phra kiao'' pin is usually used by upperclass student in some faculties. Female students are required to wear a short-sleeved blouse with a fold along the spine. The buttons must be made of metal, and a small ''phra kiao'' emblem must be pinned on the right breast. A dark blue or black pleated skirt with any black, white, or brown shoes are worn. For female first-year students, white leather shoes are mandatory.&lt;ref&gt;ราชกิจจานุเบกษา, [http://www.ratchakitcha.soc.go.th/DATA/PDF/2553/E/052/25.PDF ข้อบังคับจุฬาฯ ว่าด้วยเครื่องแบบ เครื่องหมาย และเครื่องแต่งกายนิสิต พ.ศ.๒๕๕๓], เล่ม ๑๒๗, ตอนพิเศษ ๕๒ ง, ๒๖ เมษายน พ.ศ.๒๕๕๓ (The university regulation on uniform and dress codes, 2010)&lt;/ref&gt; Chulalongkorn University's uniforms have long been the template of many uniforms used in other universities in Thailand.

=== Academic dress ===
{{see main|Suea khrui|Academic dress of Chulalongkorn University}}

The [[academic dress]] of Chulalongkorn University is based on ceremonial attire called ''suea krui'', which is long-sleeved robe made of very fine mesh. Like dresses worn in [[Academic dress in the United Kingdom|the United Kingdom]], the robe is open-fronted and calf-length. [[Square academic cap|Cap]] and hood, however, are omitted. A colored [[felt]] strip decorated with gold-colored ribbons is attached to the margin of the gown including elbow and wrist. Bachelors and masters students wear a black strip, while [[scarlet (color)|scarlet]] and pink are for PhDs (including honorary degrees recipients) and lecturers. A yellow strip is specially used for the king of Thailand.&lt;ref&gt;ราชกิจจานุเบกษา.[http://www.ratchakitcha.soc.go.th/DATA/PDF/2473/A/92.PDF พระราชกำหนดเสื้อครุยบัณฑิตของจุฬาลงกรณ์มหาวิทยาลัย พ.ศ.๒๔๗๓]. เล่ม ๔๗, ๖ กรกฎาคม ๒๔๗๓. (Regulation on Chulalongkorn University Graduation Gown, 1930)&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, the colored yarn (bachelor) or ribbon (master and doctor) is added to the center of the strip longitudinally, according to degree-granting faculty.&lt;ref&gt;ราชกิจจานุเบกษา.[http://www.ratchakitcha.soc.go.th/DATA/PDF/2553/E/052/20.PDF ข้อบังคับจุฬาฯ ว่าด้วยการกำหนดปริญญาในสาขาวิชา อักษรย่อสำหรับสาขาวิชา ครุยวิทยฐานะ เข็มวิทยฐานะ และครุยประจำตำแหน่ง พ.ศ.๒๕๕๓].เล่ม ๑๒๗ ตอนพิเศษ ๕๒ ง, ๒๖ เมษายน ๒๕๕๓.

===Rain Trees===
[[File:RaintreeCU.JPG|150px|thumbnail|Rain Tree near CU Auditorium]]

[[Albizia saman|Rain tree]]s are common on the university campus. They are associated with the cycle of student life. Fresh green leaves at beginning of the term represent the freshmen's naivete. As the tree produces slimy pods and sheds leaves, the ground beneath it becomes slippery, thus alerting students to prepare for examinations. If they walk carefully, they will not slip (pass examinations). If they walk heedlessly, they will slip and fall (fail examinations).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chula.ac.th/about/symbol_prakew/relatelink/symbol_chamjuree/index.htm Rain Tree-The Symbol of Chulalongkorn University] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110607083703/http://www.chula.ac.th/about/symbol_prakew/relatelink/symbol_chamjuree/index.htm |date=June 7, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1937–1957, many rain trees were cut down to free space for new buildings. King [[Bhumibol Adulyadej]] noticed the dramatic decrease in the number of rain trees. On 15 January 1962, he brought five trees from [[Hua Hin]] and planted them in front of the university auditorium, proclaiming: "...I give these five trees as an eternal memorial." ({{Lang-th|จึงขอฝากต้นไม้ไว้ห้าต้นให้เป็นเครื่องเตือนใจตลอดกาล}}).

Chulalongkorn University consists of 19 faculties, three colleges, one school and many institutes which function as teaching and research units.&lt;ref name="fac1"&gt;ราชกิจจานุเบกษา, [http://www.ratchakitcha.soc.go.th/DATA/PDF/2553/E/016/70.PDF ประกาศจุฬาลงกรณ์มหาวิทยาลัย เรื่อง ส่วนงานของมหาวิทยาลัย พ.ศ. ๒๕๕๒], เล่ม ๑๒๗, ตอนพิเศษ ๑๖ ง, ๑ กุมภาพันธ์ พ.ศ. ๒๕๕๓, หน้า ๗๐ (University notification (rather command) on academic units, 2008)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="fac2"&gt;ราชกิจจานุเบกษา, [http://www.ratchakitcha.soc.go.th/DATA/PDF/2557/E/049/2.PDF ประกาศจุฬาลงกรณ์มหาวิทยาลัย เรื่อง ส่วนงานของมหาวิทยาลัย (ฉบับที่ ๒) พ.ศ. ๒๕๕๗], เล่ม ๑๓๑, ตอนพิเศษ ๔๙ ง, ๑๘ มีนาคม พ.ศ. ๒๕๕๗, หน้า ๓ (Amendment to 2008 regulation, ratified 2014)&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 1917, the university had four faculties: Arts and Sciences, Public Administration, Engineering, and Medicine. The Faculty of Law was established in 1933 as part of the Faculty of Law and Political Science.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.law.chula.ac.th www.law.chula.ac.th] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110829065254/http://www.law.chula.ac.th/ |date=August 29, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; From the 1930s to the 1950s it expanded to various fields including Pharmacy (1934), Veterinary Science (1935), Architecture (1939), Dentistry (1940), and Commerce and Accountancy (1943). In 1943, the regency government under General [[Phibun]] separated the Faculty of Medicine, Dentistry, Pharmacy, and Veterinary Science to become the University of Medical Sciences, now [[Mahidol University]]. In 1948, the Faculty of Political Science was re-established. The Faculty of Education was established in 1957 from the School of Teacher Training at Baan Somdet Chao Phraya ({{lang-th|โรงเรียนฝึกหัดครู บ้านสมเด็จเจ้าพระยา}}).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.edu.chula.ac.th/ Faculty of Education, Chulalongkorn University] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110904113033/http://www.edu.chula.ac.th/ |date=September 4, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1967, the Faculty of Veterinary Science was returned from [[Kasetsart University]] and the [[Faculty of Medicine, Chulalongkorn University|Faculty of Medicine]] at [[King Chulalongkorn Memorial Hospital|Chulalongkorn Hospital]] was moved from [[Mahidol University|University of Medical Sciences]] to Chulalongkorn University. In 1972, the Faculty of Dentistry and Faculty of Pharmacy were reinstated.

The Office of the Commission on Agricultural Resource Education (OCARE) was established in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ocare.chula.ac.th/index.php/about-us/history.html Principles and history of establishing OCARE.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110305193816/http://www.ocare.chula.ac.th/index.php/about-us/history.html |date=March 5, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is not an administrative office, but a school in which teaching and research are carried out. It admits students from two groups: one from northern Thai provinces ([[Nan Province|Nan]], [[Phayao Province|Phayao]], [[Phrae Province|Phrae]], [[Uttaradit Province|Uttaradit]]) and another from the rest of country. It was upgraded to the School of Agricultural Resources with full degree-granting power on 5 March 2014.&lt;ref name="fac2"/&gt; In 2014 it became the School of Agriculture, Chulalongkorn University (SAR).

The '''Corps Berlin''' is a fraternity (''[[Studentenverbindung]]'') in [[Berlin]], Germany, founded on February 9, 2009 with roots dating back to December 2, 1859. It is one of 162 ''[[German Student Corps]]'' in Germany, Austria, Switzerland, Belgium, Latvia and Hungary today. The Corps is a member of the [[Weinheimer Senioren-Convent]] (WSC), the second oldest federation of classical European [[Corporation (university)|fraternal corporations]], with roots dating back to the 15th century and fraternities founded in several European countries.&lt;ref name="DieCorps"&gt;Die Corps. "Was sind die Corps? - Who are the Corps?" http://www.die-corps.de/interessenten.0.html Retrieved on Oct. 7, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Klimczuk"&gt;Klimczuk, Stephen &amp; [[Gerald Warner|Warner, Gerald]].

Sterling Publishing, 2009, New York and London. {{ISBN|978-1-4027-6207-9}}. pp.&amp;nbsp;212–232 ("University Secret Societies and Dueling Corps").&lt;/ref&gt;

Membership in the fraternity is open to [[Honour|honorable]] men&lt;ref name="duel" /&gt; studying at one of Berlin's [[University|universities]] and is based exclusively on personality, good moral standing, and strength of character.&lt;ref name="principles"&gt;Die Corps. "Prinzipien der Corps" An article explaining the principles of being a Corps Student: http://www.die-corps.de/prinzipien.0.html Retrieved on Oct. 7, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Members of the Corps Berlin value and engage in the tradition of academic fencing&lt;ref name="Klimczuk" /&gt;&lt;ref name="lit_2" /&gt; as a way to sharpen and prove their character under pressure. Continuing a practice dating back into the 1700s, Corps Berlin's members wear the traditional [[couleur]], colored stripes, in green-white-black. The fraternity teaches and expects tolerance from its members, stemming from diverse ethnic, national, religious and political backgrounds.&lt;ref name="Klimczuk" /&gt;&lt;ref name="lit_2" /&gt;

== Fundamentals and principles ==
Like all ''German Student Corps'', Corps Berlin expects tolerance from its members in [[German Student Corps#Politics|political]], [[German Student Corps#Sciences|scientific]] and [[List of members of German student corps|religious]] affairs.&lt;ref name="principles" /&gt; Members are encouraged to have their own point of view about the world and be able to argue it, but Corps Berlin as an entity always remains neutral. This ''[[Neutrality (philosophy)|neutrality]]'' is a fundamental pillar of all Corps and differentiates them from fraternities who require a certain political or religious affinity.&lt;ref name="DieCorps" /&gt; The fraternity encourages freshly admitted (pledging "fox") members with diverse ethnic, national, religious and political backgrounds to prove themselves as valuable Corps brothers, purely on the basis of personal [[ethos|character]] and [[recognition (sociology)|merit]], before becoming eligible to be fully incorporated (''Rezeption'').&lt;ref name="principles" /&gt;&lt;ref name="lit_2b" /&gt; The fraternity has about 220 members of all ages (including alumni) coming from or currently residing in Europe, Asia, the Americas and Africa. Every full member is a member for life.

[[File:Mühlberg - Säbelmensur.jpg|170px|thumb|left|[[Academic fencing|Academic "Mensur" fencing]] in 1900. Steel goggles provide added protection nowadays.]]
Members of the Corps Berlin value and practice the tradition of engagements in ''[[academic fencing]]'', or ''"Mensur"'' in German, with members of other old-school fraternities. Academic fencing, originating in the [[German school of fencing]], is understood as a way to exercise good judgement and prove character,&lt;ref name="duel" /&gt; allowing participants to show determination by standing their ground under pressure, while enhancing the bonds between the Corps brothers at the same time.&lt;ref name="lit_2b" /&gt;&lt;ref name="fechten"&gt;Die Corps. "Hoch bitte – Los!" An article explaining the role of academic fencing at Corps: http://www.die-corps.de/fechten.0.html Retrieved on Oct. 7, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mark Twain]] described one of these fencing duels/challenges in his day and age; his description is remarkably similar to current practices.&lt;ref name="lit_2" /&gt;&lt;ref name="lit_2b" /&gt;&lt;ref name="lit_2c" /&gt; Corps Berlin's members identify themselves wearing the traditional ''couleur'', colored stripes, as well as caps and/or other specific garments at official occasions. This tradition, known as "wearing colors" (German: ''Farben tragen''), provides means to recognize members of other fraternities and, likewise, identification for the Corps brothers with each other and their traditions.&lt;ref name="lit_2b" /&gt;

''Activity'' and ''responsibility'' are two fundamental expectations for fraternity members. With the goal to achieve members who are prepared to become active leaders in society, every Corps brother is expected to hold a leadership position at least once for a term ("Semester") while a student. Members are further encouraged to organize internal and open fraternity events that draw attention from other fraternities and guests from industry, academia, politics and other active societies.&lt;ref name="DieCorps" /&gt; Allocating the necessary resources appropriately and living up to set expectations teaches responsibility.&lt;ref name="principles" /&gt;&lt;ref name="lit_2b" /&gt; All members must show active participation in the regular fraternity Convents, providing the foundation for the fraternity's members to meet and discuss past, present and future developments. Decisions are cast in a democratic manner, sometimes after intense debates. Participation at such Convents teaches a better understanding of proper argumentation, group dynamics and critical analysis of other members' views, plans and arguments, thereby preparing its participants to become active members of society.&lt;ref name="principles" /&gt; Similarly, every member must finish his higher educational degree with good academic standing in order to advance to the status of ''Alter Herr'' (alumnus).

Long-term guidance is expected from and provided by said ''Alte Herren'', who often remain very engaged and well connected with the fraternity. Every year at the end of May, student and alumni members of all German Student Corps meet in one of two cities ([[Weinheim]] and [[Bad Kösen]]) for three days to refresh their bonds with their fraternity and friends from the entire Corps network (WSC/[[Kösener Senioren-Convents-Verband|KSCV]]).&lt;ref name="DieCorps" /&gt; In addition to these international meetings once a year, alumni join the student members for multiple local meetings, lasting an evening or a weekend. These regular meetings result in strong bonds spanning the generations within the fraternity.&lt;ref name="principles" /&gt;

=== Foundation ===
[[File:SchlägerOvBMuseumFriedrichsruh.jpg|thumb|150px|[[Otto von Bismarck|Bismarck]]'s student sword and helmet, comparable to those used by the fraternity's members then and now.]]
The fraternity was founded by joining three Corps on February 9, 2009: ''Corps Cheruscia'' with its original founding date December 2, 1859; ''Corps Rheno-Guestphalia'' with its original founding date February 4, 1870; and ''Corps Teutonia'' with its original founding date July 1, 1870.

=== Today ===
The fraternity has official relationships with the [[Corps Altsachsen Dresden]], [[Corps Saxo-Thuringia München]] in Munich and Corps Hannoverania in Hanover, forming the ''[[Blaues Kartell]]'' of four fraternities throughout Germany that understand the cartel as one large fraternity in four different cities.

== Relationships with other fraternities ==
Corps Berlin is a member of the "[[Blaues Kartell]]", a circle of four German Student Corps that understand the union as "one fraternity spanning four cities" (Berlin, Dresden, Hanover, and Munich).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20580">'''Delco Hi-Q''', formerly '''Scott's Hi-Q''', or just '''Hi-Q''' is an academic quiz competition.  It was founded in 1948, and is now an intracounty competition of [[high school]] students in six different states: Pennsylvania, [[Wisconsin]], [[Washington (U.S. state)|Washington]], [[Ohio]], [[Florida]], and [[Alabama]].

==History==
Delco Hi-Q is the oldest continuous academic quiz competition in the United States. It was started as radio quiz program for high school students in [[Delaware County, Pennsylvania|Delaware County]], [[Pennsylvania]] by the [[Scott Paper Company]], which ran it as a community relations program. "Hi" represented "High School" and "Q" represented "I.Q." The first prize in 1948 was a $1,000 "auditorium style" television set. Robert O. Johnson served as the first Quizmaster. During the early years of Hi-Q, contests were broadcast on radio station WPWA 1590.

Questions were designed to test the general knowledge that students received in the classroom. Over the years, new reference materials were added and students began to answer questions based on specific categories and reference works.

Teams were initially composed of four students for each school; teams were subsequently expanded to six students and then to the current eight-member team.  Drawn from three elements, SCOTT, High School, and I.Q., the program was known from the beginning as '''Scott’s Hi-Q'''. The success of Scott’s Hi-Q in Delaware County led Scott Paper to introduce the program across the country. Hi-Q National Director, Donna Zerby, helped the competition expand in 1976 to Washington State, in 1977 to Wisconsin/Michigan, in 1982 to Maine, in 1984 to Arkansas, and in 1987 to Alabama.

After the merger of Scott Paper with [[Kimberly-Clark]] in 1997, the program was turned over to longtime director, Donna Zerby. She partnered with the Delaware County Chamber of Commerce to provide stable funding for the program. Kimberly-Clark Corporation-Chester Operations became the primary corporate sponsor and the twenty-one area high schools began financially contributing to the program. Other sponsors and supporters began contributing. Donna Zerby also continued her involvement with Hi-Q on a national level, serving as an independent consultant to those locations.

Delaware County Intermediate Unit (DCIU) and The Foundation of the Delaware County Chamber entered into a joint sponsorship agreement in 2004 to co-sponsor Delco Hi-Q. DCIU is responsible for providing a Quizmaster, Program Director, as well as the technical services needed to run and manage the program. The Foundation is responsible for soliciting contributions for the program, collecting entrance fees, administering funds, supplies, and conducts the annual awards ceremony. Franklin Mint Federal Credit Union joined Kimberly-Clark as a primary corporate sponsor in 2004 with an initial five year, $75,000 commitment.

Franklin Mint Federal Credit Union [http://www.fmfcu.org] joined Delco Hi-Q as a primary corporate sponsor in 2004 and has made a long-term commitment to strengthen and sponsor the program and the Partners in Education Celebration. DCIU and Franklin Mint Federal Credit Union started the Delco Hall of Honor in the same year. Its purpose is to honor past participants and supporters and to provide role models for current Hi-Q participants Another new tradition began in 2005, DCIU and FMFCU partnered with the Delaware County Daily Times to start the tradition of the All Delco Hi-Q Team.  Donna Zerby was the first inductee into the Hall of Honor and considered it the greatest honor of her career.

The Partners in Education Celebration was started in 2005. What was once a luncheon honoring the three top teams, became a 600-person banquet honoring all of the Delco Hi-Q participants. The dinner is held annually and is presented by the Foundation and DCIU. [[Alex Trebek]] served as the guest speaker and 6ABC's Action News anchor Rick Williams was master of ceremonies for the first celebration.

After the passing of Donna in 2005, Ginger Beaumont agreed to serve as director for the 2005/06 season. Ginger had previously spent six years coordinating the Delaware County program under the direction of Mrs. Zerby. The 2005/06 season was dedicated in memory of Donna and her 42-year association with Hi-Q.

In 2006, Franklin Mint Federal Credit Union signed an agreement with DCIU to provide question resources and Program Directors to Delco Hi-Q. Ginger Beaumont remained with Hi-Q and serves as Co-Director with Rick Durante of FMFCU.

In 2008, Delaware County Intermediate Unit and Franklin Mint Federal Credit Union became co-sponsors of the program. Franklin Mint Federal Credit Union Foundation manages the program.

Hi-Q competitions still take place in Washington, Wisconsin, Alabama, and Pennsylvania, each with different sponsoring organizations. In 1979, Tom McCarthy began his 39 season run as Quizmaster. Rick Durante, Executive Director Franklin Mint Federal Credit Union Foundation, now serves as Quizmaster and Director of the competition.&lt;ref&gt;https://fmfcufoundation.org/delco-hiq/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contest Information==

Twenty-one Delaware County high schools participate in Delco Hi-Q.

Each school team is composed of up to ten students. 
Each school hosts one contest during the standard season.

Questions are prepared from 14 subjects, including: [[Art History]], [[Biology]], [[Chemistry]], [[Current Events]], [[Geography]], [[Literature]], [[Mathematics]], [[Physics]], [[Shakespeare]], [[Sports]], [[U.S. Government]], [[U.S. History]], and [[World History]]. Questions are selected from standard high school scholastic curricula, general scholastic knowledge, or from reference materials provided.

Each high school team competes in three matches each season, excluding possible semi-final and championship appearances.  Each match consists of three competing teams.  Each match is hosted by one of the participating teams competing in that match.  Matches are typically held in the high school auditorium on stage, before an audience of students, teachers, faculty, and community members.  Questions are read aloud by the Quizmaster, and at times team members use buzzers to answer questions. Points awarded throughout the season accumulate and determine semi-final and championship entry eligibility.

The highest-scoring team at the end of the regular season automatically becomes a participant in the Championship Match and does not compete in the Semifinals. The Semifinal Round is a six-team competition. From points accumulated during the regular season, the second highest-scoring team will play teams in positions six and seven. The third highest-scoring team will play teams in positions four and five. In the single-contest Championship Match, the two semifinal winners compete against the highest-scoring team from the standard season. All teams start at zero in the semifinal and the championship match.

Delco Hi-Q participants are honored at the annual "Partners in Education" dinner in May. Guest speakers have included celebrities such as [[Alex Trebek]] and [[John Allen Paulos]].

==Awards==

In the Championship Match, first, second and third place teams win cash awards for their schools of $3,000, $2,500 and $2,000 respectively.

A revolving trophy is presented annually to the Champion for display by that school throughout the next season. A permanent award is also presented to the top school. Individually engraved plaques are awarded to each school. Franklin Mint Federal Credit Union and Kimberly-Clark Corporation Chester Operations sponsor awards for each team.

The Partners in Education Celebration was started in 2005. What was once a luncheon honoring the three top teams, became a 600-person banquet honoring all of the Delco Hi-Q participants. The dinner is held annually and is presented by the Foundation and DCIU. Jeopardy host Alex Trebek served as the guest speaker and 6ABC's Action News anchor Rick Williams was master of ceremonies for the first celebration.

DCIU and Franklin Mint Federal Credit Union started the Delco Hall of Honor in the same year. Its purpose is to honor past participants and supporters and to provide role models for current Hi-Q participants Another new tradition began in 2005, DCIU and FMFCU partnered with the Delaware County Daily Times to start the tradition of the All Delco Hi-Q Team. Donna Zerby was the first inductee into the Hall of Honor and considered it the greatest honor of her 42-year Hi-Q career.

After the passing of Donna in 2005, Ginger Beaumont agreed to serve as director for the 2005/06 season. Mrs. Beaumont had previously spent six years coordinating the Delaware County program under the direction of Mrs. Zerby. The 2005/06 season was dedicated in memory of Donna and her 42-year association with Hi-Q. The revolving championship trophy was renamed the "Donna Zerby Trophy."

In 2006, Franklin Mint Federal Credit Union signed an agreement with DCIU to provide question resources and Program Directors to Delco Hi-Q. Ginger Beaumont remained with Hi-Q and served as Co-Director with Rick Durante of FMFCU until 2007.

In 2008, Delaware County Intermediate Unit and Franklin Mint Federal Credit Union became co-sponsors of the program.

As of the 2018/19 Season Rick Durante of Franklin Mint Federal Credit Union serves as Director and Quizmaster, Danielle Griffin is Assistant Director, and production engineer is Dave Bramble from Delaware County Intermediate Unit.

In addition to the participating schools’ support, primary corporate sponsors are Franklin Mint Federal Credit Union and the Wilbur C. and Betty Lea Henderson Foundation &lt;ref&gt;http://www.hendersongroupinc.com/about-us/corporate-social-responsibility/&lt;/ref&gt; Valedictorian sponsor is Kimberly-Clark Corporation.

&lt;nowiki&gt;*&lt;/nowiki&gt;The champion schools no longer participate in Hi-Q because of school mergers.

==Washington State Hi-Q==
Hi-Q competitions occur in Washington State, run and sponsored by Everett Community College. Currently, there are nine teams, classified by their size and athletic districts. Matches follow the same format as the Delco Hi-Q team, and Washington state champions participate in a national championship, between Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, and Alabama.

Everett Community College is the primary sponsor for the program in the Everett Region. The program also receives support from local community groups, businesses, and foundations. Additionally, participating schools contribute toward the program's funding. The Hi-Q Regional Coordinator from Everett Community College manages the program to meet objectives and ensure a positive experience for the students.

In 2012 Everett Community College dropped its funding for the Hi-Q program, but local schools have adopted the program. The program is now headed by [[Monroe High School (Washington)|Monroe High School]]. Participating schools as of October 2012 include [[Lynnwood High School]], [[Edmonds Woodway High School]], [[Henry M. Jackson High School]], [[Archbishop Murphy High School]], [[Stanwood High School]], [[Meadowdale High School (Washington)|Meadowdale High School]], [[Mountlake Terrace High School]], [[Marysville Pilchuck High School]], [[Marysville Getchell High School]].

A '''dialogue journal''' is an ongoing written interaction between two people to exchange experiences, ideas, or reflections. It is used most often in education as a means of [https://learningenglish.voanews.com/a/take-a-break-from-essay-writing-with-dialogue-journals/4065764.html sustained written interaction]  between students and teachers &lt;ref name="Peyton 1993"&gt;Peyton, J.K., &amp; Staton, J. (1993). ''Dialogue journals in the multilingual classroom: Building language fluency and writing skills through written interaction.'' Norwood, NJ: Ablex.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":37"&gt;Staton, J. (1988). An introduction to dialogue journal communication. In J. Staton, R. Shuy, J. K. Peyton, &amp; L. Reed (Eds.), ''Dialogue journal communication: Classroom, linguistic, social, and cognitive views'' (pp. 1-32). Norwood, NJ: Ablex.&lt;/ref&gt; at all education levels. It can be used to promote [[second language learning]] (English and other languages) and learning in all areas.&lt;ref&gt;Peyton, J.K. (2000).{{cite web|title = Dialogue Journals: Interactive Writing to Develop Language and Literacy|url=http://www.cal.org/caela/esl_resources/digests/Dialogue_Journals.html|accessdate = 13 January 2016|publisher=Washington, D.C.: Center for Applied Linguistics}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dialogue journals are used in many schools as a form of [[communication]] between teachers and students to improve the life that they share in the classroom&lt;ref name=":15"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Staton J | year = 1980 | title = Writing and counseling: Using a dialogue journal | url = | journal = Language Arts | volume = 57 | issue = | page = 5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; by exchanging ideas and shared topics of interest, promoting writing in a non-evaluative context, and promoting [[student engagement]] with learning. They are also used between teachers and teacher trainers to provide [[Teacher education|professional development]] opportunities and improve teaching.

Dialogue journal interaction occurs in notebooks, letters, email exchanges, and audio journals. The important feature is that two people are communicating with each other, about topics and issues of interest to both, and the interaction continues over time.

Dialogue journals are a teacher-developed practice''',''' first researched in the 1980s in an [[Ethnography|ethnographi]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;c study of a sixth grade American classroom with native English speakers,&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;Staton, J., Shuy, R., Peyton, J.K., &amp; Reed, L.(1988). ''Dialogue journal communication: Classroom, linguistic, social, and cognitive views''     (pp. 1-32). Norwood, NJ: Ablex.&lt;/ref&gt; supported by a grant to the [[Center for Applied Linguistics]] from the [[National Institute of Education]] (NIE), Teaching &amp; Learning Division. Applications to other educational settings developed quickly as a way to enhance writing development and the teacher-student relationship across linguistic and cultural barriers, with increasing use in [[Second language|second language instruction]], [[deaf education]], and [[Adult literacy|adult literacy education]]. Since the 1980s, dialogue journal practice has expanded to many countries around the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cal.org/adultesl/resources/bibliographies/published-works-about-dialogue-journal-research-and-use.php |title=Resources: Briefs - CAL Solutions Adult ESL |website=Cal.org |date=2005-01-21 |accessdate=2017-07-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Further Reading section at the end of this article includes resources with guidelines on specific ways to use dialogue journal writing in various contexts.

==History of dialogue journal use and research==
[[File:Dialogue Journal With a Sixth Grade Student.jpg|alt=Leslie Reed writing with Andy, a sixth grade student from Korea|thumb|Leslie Reed writing with Andy, a sixth grade student from Korea]]
The use of dialogue journals as a classroom practice was first documented in the early 1980s, with an in-depth study of its use in a sixth grade classroom in Los Angeles.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The teacher, Leslee Reed, wrote daily throughout the school year with each of her students in a dialogue journal (a small notebook) to promote personalized, ongoing, supportive communication.

The first study of Mrs. Reed's classroom of all native English speakers (1979-1980) was followed by a second study (1981-1982) of the same teacher teaching a 6th grade class of students from other countries, all learning English as a second language (ESL), again for an entire year.&lt;ref name="Peyton 1993" /&gt;

The practice spread to deaf education in 1982, with the invitation from [[William Stokoe]] at the [[Gallaudet University]] Linguistics Research Laboratory to Jana Staton to conduct research and work with teachers at all levels on the Gallaudet University campus.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;Staton, J. (1990). ''Conversations in writing: A guide for using dialogue journals with deaf''  ''post-secondary and secondary students.'' (GRI Monograph Series B, No. 4). Washington, DC: Gallaudet Research Institute, Gallaudet University&lt;/ref&gt;

With the publication of research on the sixth grade ESL students, use of dialogue journals with [[English as a second or foreign language|ESL]] students and research on the practice and outcomes began growing through the 1980s and 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;Peyton, J.K. (Ed.) (1990). ''Students and teachers writing together: Perspectives on journal writing.'' Alexandria, VA: Teachers of English to Speakers of Other Languages. https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Students_and_Teachers_Writing_Together.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The practice is now used in educational settings and classrooms at all age levels, from kindergarten through university courses, in adult education programs,&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;Peyton, J.K., &amp; Staton, J. (1996). ''Writing our lives: Reflections on dialogue writing with adults learning English''. McHenry, IL &amp; Washington, D.C.: Delta Systems &amp; Center for Applied Linguistics.&lt;/ref&gt; and in teacher education programs, to promote open communication, connections among teachers and learners, knowledge sharing, and reading and writing development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tirfonline.org/resources/references |title=References &amp;#124; The International Research Foundation for English Language Education |website=Tirfonline.org |date= |accessdate=2017-07-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Key concepts and key features==
Research on dialogue journal use at all age levels—with native speakers of the language of the writing, first and second language learners, deaf students, and teachers—has identified key features of dialogue journal communication that set it apart from most writing in educational settings: authentic communication, collaborative learning and knowledge building, critical thinking, personal voice, critical pedagogy, reciprocal discourse, zone of proximal development, literacy as an interactive process, relationship building, and counseling.

A dialogue journal allows students and a teacher to together use [[Communication|authentic communication]] (including questioning, complaining, complimenting, apologizing, and requesting) to communicate honestly and openly and “get things done”.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Shuy, R.W. (1984). Language as a foundation for education in the school context. ''Theory into Practice'', 167-174.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Shuy R.W. | year = 1987 | title = Research currents: Dialogue as the heart of learning | url = | journal = Language Arts | volume = 64 | issue = 8| pages = 890–897 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This distinguishes it from most student writing assignments, which are restricted to monologic description, explanation, or narrative. This aspect of everyday language use is known in philosophy as speech acts ([[John Searle]])&lt;ref&gt;Searle, J. (1969). ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=t3_WhfknvF0C&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Speech acts: An essay in the philosophy of language]''. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; and in linguistics as [[pragmatics]]. ([[J. L. Austin|J.L. Austin]])&lt;ref&gt;Austin, J.L. (1962, 1975). ''How to do things with words''. Oxford: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Dialogue journal conversation, unlike academic writing, opens up opportunities to use almost the full range of these natural functions of language.

By engaging in interactive and functional interactions in a private context, dialogue journal partners in educational settings are engaged in [[collaborative learning]] and collaborative [[knowledge building]] about the topic or task they are working on, each other's experiences and background, and perceptions and thoughts about shared topics.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;Staton, J.

Dialogue journals have been studied by a number of researchers for their value in developing students' [[critical thinking]] by providing opportunities for students to practice self-reflective awareness and to critique classroom practices, teaching assignments, and social contexts, in both first&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; and second language acquisition settings.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Ghahremani-Ghajar S., Mirhosseini S.A. | year = 2005 | title = English class or speaking about everything class?

[[Critical pedagogy]] in dialogue journal writing creates contexts for students to think critically, often in collaboration with the teacher, and develop communicative language abilities as well as critical understanding and awareness of the language and the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Crookes G., Lehner A. | year = 1998 | title = Aspects of process in an ESL critical pedagogy teacher education course | url = | journal = TESOL Quarterly | volume = 32 | issue = 2| pages = 319–328 | doi=10.2307/3587586| jstor = 3587586 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Norton, B., &amp; Toohey, K.

The dialogue journal's reciprocal discourse structure&lt;ref&gt;[https://s3-ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/nonghocbucket/UploadDocument_server07_id24231_50525/Handbook_of_Discourse_Processes.pdf#page=174]

The power to question, challenge, and complain becomes equally shared by both writers.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Dialogue journals visibly record how learning occurs in the [[zone of proximal development]], a key concept in the psychology of [[Lev Vygotsky]].&lt;ref name=":17"&gt;Vygotsky, L.S. (1962). ''Thought and language''. Cambridge, MA: MIT Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":18"&gt;Vygotsky, L.S. (1978). ''Mind in society: The development of higher psychological processe''s. Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Vygotsky, learning takes place in the space or "zone" that a child or learner is working in when solving a problem or accomplishing a task. The teacher or more competent peer assists, "scaffolds," the child's actions or behavior by working collaboratively with the learner. This is different from the learner's actual abilities when working independently on the same task or goal. This concept captures the nature of dialogue journal communication, in which the goal of understanding is achieved by a collaborative effort, with the more competent partner ensuring its accomplishment&lt;ref name="Lindfors J.W. 1988 63–85"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Lindfors J.W. | year = 1988 | title = From helping hand to reciprocity to mutuality: Dialogue journal writing with Zulu students | url = | journal = Journal of Learning About Learning | volume = 1 | issue = 1| pages = 63–85 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Nassaji, H. 2000"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Nassaji H., Cumming A. | year = 2000 | title = What's in a ZPD?

==Reading==
[[File:Teacher writing with a student.jpg|alt=Teacher writing with a student about a story they have read|thumb|Teacher writing with a student about a story they have read]]
In dialogue journal interactions, reading and writing are integrated as communicative activities.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; A few researchers have directly explored the value of dialogue journal writing for developing and assessing reading competence, especially for students acquiring [[English as a second or foreign language|English as a second language]] and in literature and reading classes with developing readers. One question about the writing it to what extent, and in what ways, it serves as a reading text.

Walworth&lt;ref name=":38"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Walworth M | year = 1985 | title = Dialogue journals and the teaching of reading | url = | journal = Teaching English to Deaf and Second-Language Students | volume = 3 | issue = 1| pages = 21–25 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":39"&gt;Walworth, M. (1990). Interactive teaching of reading: A model. (pp. 35-47). In J.K. Peyton (Ed.), ''Students and teacher writing together: Perspectives on journal writing'' (pp. 35-47). Alexandria, VA: Teachers of English to Speakers of Other Languages. https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Students_and_Teachers_Writing_Together.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; described the use of dialogue journals to individualize instruction for profoundly deaf college students in advanced college-level reading classes. The written interactions with her students, still struggling with reading and writing in English, provided her with an immediate, ongoing assessment of individual levels of comprehension. Walworth's analysis shows the growth of student [[Reading comprehension|comprehension]], as student entries began to predict and clarify story plot and character relationships and get at the “deep reasoning” of the characters in the novels. She argues that the teacher/student interactions provide students with opportunities to “try out ideas” and explore the edges of their comprehension, taking the risks that advanced adult reading requires. Walworth's analysis demonstrates how a teacher and a student can work together, first to determine the student's schema or background knowledge and then to make use of it to promote understanding of the meaning of the text.

Studies with hearing students learning English in university courses find similar patterns, with the writing of the teacher providing continuity and coherence to ideas discussed, flow to the writing, and mutual understanding of ideas.&lt;ref name=":19" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;Chiesa, D., Damerow, R., &amp; Bailey, K.M. (2013). “The use of dialogue journals with university EFL students: A sociocultural perspective.” ''The Asian Journal of English Language &amp; Pedagogy, Vol. 1'', pp. 1-23. http://www.myjurnal.my/public/article-view.php?id=83196&lt;/ref&gt;

Shuy&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Shuy R.W. | year = 1990 | title = An argument for the use of dialogue journals to assess reading comprehension of deaf students | url = | journal = The Georgetown Journal of Languages and Linguistics (1) | volume = 3 | issue = | pages = 355–369 }}&lt;/ref&gt; conducted a case study of a profoundly deaf student's dialogue journal entries in high school to assess the student's growth in reading comprehension over time. He identified five specific features of the student's responses to the teacher's entries that demonstrate comprehension: (1) propositional statements, (2) questions, (3) appropriate inferences, (4) appropriate responses to opinions, and (5) requests for clarification. Shuy argues that dialogue journals can be used as a more accurate assessment of student text comprehension than decontextualized [[standardized test]]s of comprehension, particularly for students from a completely different first language context (e.g., [[American Sign Language]]).

These studies focus on the role of interactional dialogues in expanding students’ awareness of and engagement with books and authors, with the goal of taking readers deeper into written texts.&lt;ref name=":20" /&gt; Atwell points out that dialogue journal interactions create the [[zone of proximal development]],&lt;ref name=":17" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":18" /&gt; in which “mediated learning” can occur, as an expert reader cooperates with a less experienced one to construct meaning from a text. Atwell found that the dialogue journal conversations (1) encouraged students to connect fiction to their own lives; (2) encouraged reflection on themselves as readers, making them conscious of how they learned to read, which included process and rituals; and (3) developed awareness of character, plot, and book structure. Atwell described how the ongoing dialogue changed her written responses from asking “test questions” (questions to which the teacher already knows the answer) to a pattern of offering advice only when asked, and using “nudging” comments to expand students’ awareness of meaning and of strategies for understanding written text.

In dialogue journal interactions, regardless of whether or not the topic discussed is specified as a reading assignment, reading and writing are integrated as communicative activities.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

==Writing development==
Increasingly, writing is a critical part of learning in all areas of education—English Language Arts and all content areas. The ability to write effectively is a requirement for success at all levels of education from elementary school through high school and in university and adult education classes.&lt;ref&gt;Wright, S. (2011, October 5). Why writing skills are more important than ever. ''Education Insider News Blog.'' http://study.com/articles/Why_Writing_Skills_are_More_Important_Than_Ever.html&lt;/ref&gt; The current focus of the [http://www.corestandards.org/ Common Core State Standards] and [http://www.actfl.org/publications/all/world-readiness-standards-learning-languages World-Readiness Standards] on academic excellence, including writing, has increased the amount and sophistication of writing that students are engaged in and required to do.

Research shows that the act of writing deepens understanding of a topic or area of thought, improves the ability to process and express ideas, and can result in increased critical thinking.&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt; However, when ability to perform on specific writing tasks is the primary or only focus in class, student engagement can suffer. Hall and Duffy&lt;ref name=":23"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Hall N., Duffy R. | year = 1987 | title = Every child has a story to tell | url = http://www.ncte.org/journals/la/issues/v64-5 | journal = Language Arts | volume = 64 | issue = 5| pages = 523–529 }}&lt;/ref&gt; describe a group of teachers who found that, when they examined the writing of a group of elementary school students and considered what was missing from the children's writing, it was the children themselves who were missing. “The boring sentences sounded as if they had been borrowed from basal readers” (p.&amp;nbsp;523).

Studies of dialogue journal writing have shown that students (and the teachers, classroom helpers, or prospective teachers they are writing with) can increase their sense of engagement with each other, learn to express themselves for an audience, and create an atmosphere of openness and expression when that is the focus of the writing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Bromley K., Winters D., Schlimmer K. | year = 1994 | title = Book buddies: Creating enthusiasm for literacy learning | url = | journal = The Reading Teacher | volume = 47 | issue = 5| pages = 392–400 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the same time, a question that has been asked and addressed in the literature is, “Do dialogue journals help students to become better at writing and to see themselves as writers?”.&lt;ref name=":24"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Hail C., George S., Hail S. | year = 2014 | title = Moving beyond journaling to dialogues in writing | url = https://academyedstudies.files.wordpress.com/2014/12/movinig_beyond_journalingfinal.pdf | format = PDF | journal = Critical Questions in Education | volume = 4 | issue = 1| pages = 42–51 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Since dialogue journal writing has many features of conversation/interaction, does that type of writing improve the types of writing desired and required in school?

The answer to this question, of course, depends on the level of the students, the types of writing they are engaged in and need to carry out, and the nature of the written dialogue. Studies seeking to address this question have identified some positive results.

For example, research on students’ writing in dialogue with the teacher and with other students, carried out with elementary school students, high school students, university students, and adults in adult education classes has had the following results. Students ...
* Are enthusiastic about writing and engaged with the person or people they were writing with&lt;ref name=":24" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":23" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":25"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Peyton J.K, Seyoum M. | year = 1989 | title = The effect of teacher strategies on students' interactive writing | url = http://www.ncte.org/journals/rte/issues/v23-3 | journal = Research in the Teaching of English | volume = 23 | issue = 3| pages = 310–334 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Have enhanced motivation to write and increased writing fluency&lt;ref name=":26" /&gt;
* Have more confidence in themselves as writers&lt;ref name=":23" /&gt;

==Thinking and learning==
Current research and educational practice focus on the importance of providing instruction that promotes cognitive development and critical thinking. This is true not only in contexts where thinking and writing are done independently, but also in contexts where both young and adult learners interact and collaborate with more knowledgeable others. Lee&lt;ref&gt;Lee, O. (2017). Common Core State Standards for ELA/Literacy and Next Generation Science Standards: Convergences and discrepancies using argument as an example. ''Educational Researcher, 46''(2), 90-102.&lt;/ref&gt; describes the research that is guiding this shift, with a focus on developing the ability to engage in argumentative writing: &lt;blockquote&gt;A growing body of research shifts attention from what an individual student can do in isolation to how to establish a classroom community in which students experience an authentic need to engage in argumentation. Members of such classroom communities ''work together and make decisions'' about what counts as argument and what is required to support a new knowledge claim (p. 92). (Emphasis added)&lt;/blockquote&gt;Prain and Hand&lt;ref&gt;Prain, V., &amp; Hand, B. (2006). Coming to know more through and from writing. ''Educational Researcher, 45''(7), 430-434.&lt;/ref&gt; describe the need for students to be able to “choose and define problems; develop and test multimodal inquiry methods; examine findings; build, critique, and review theories and models; and make a persuasive case for claims” (p.&amp;nbsp;432) in their writing.

While personal journal writing has a long history in education settings as a way to promote reflective thinking,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=12434637 |year=2002 |last1=Kok |first1=J |title=Reflective journal writing: How it promotes reflective thinking in clinical nursing education: A students' perspective |journal=Curationis |volume=25 |issue=3 |pages=35–42 |last2=Chabeli |first2=M. M }}&lt;/ref&gt; interactive writing in a dialogue journal, with a teacher, promotes not only personal reflection but also reflection with another person, who is often more knowledgeable about the topics under consideration and provides a scaffold or support for the learner's own thoughts.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Research has shown that the act of writing itself deepens understanding of a topic or area of thought, improves the ability to process and express ideas, and fosters higher cognitive functions.&lt;ref&gt;Emig, J. (1977). Writing as a mode of learning. ''College composition and communication. (29)'' 122-128.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":17" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Yinger, R. 1985.  Journal writing as a learning tool. ''Volta Review, 87''(5), p. 21- 33.&lt;/ref&gt; Writing with a teacher or professor, in a dialogue journal, provides the opportunity for the learner to consider and incorporate the thoughts and manners of expression of an experienced member of the culture about topics that the learner is thinking and writing about. Dialogue journal writing can be described as a place for risk-free experimentation with written language, as an opportunity for developing critical literacy and a reflective perspective on a topic of focus.

Early research on dialogue journals explored the cognitive processing inherent in interactive written dialogues with a skilled teacher, drawing on Vygotsky's theory of [[Instructional scaffolding|interactional scaffolding of learning]].&lt;ref&gt;Vygotsky, L. (1934/1986). ''Thought and language.'' Cambridge, MA: MIT Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Staton studied the gradual elaboration of topic understanding on the part of a 6th grade students,&lt;ref&gt;Staton, J. (1988a). Elaboration of topics: “It’s just not gonna come down in one little sentence.” In J. Staton, R. W. Shuy, J. K. Peyton, &amp; L. Reed (Eds.), ''Dialogue journal communication: classroom, linguistic, social and cognitive views (pp''. 277-311)Norwood, N.J. Ablex.&lt;/ref&gt; the acquisition of problem solving strategies over extended periods of time,&lt;ref&gt;Staton, J. (1988b). Discussing problems. In J. Staton, R. W. Shuy, J. K. Peyton, &amp; L. Reed (Eds.), ''Dialogue journal communication: classroom, linguistic, social and cognitive views'' (pp. 202-244). Norwood, N.J. Ablex.&lt;/ref&gt; and the ways that a novice learner and teacher “thinking together” about a topic allowed the student to see and assimilate patterns of thought from an experienced and successful member of the culture (in this case, the teacher).

Recent research on the use of dialogue journals in second language acquisition settings has focused on their value in developing students' [[critical thinking]] by providing opportunities for them to practice self-reflective awareness, develop an empowered personal “voice” and critique classroom practices.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; For example, in a case study of dialogue journal writing over 10 months between a 6-year-old Farsi speaker beginning to learn English with his Canadian teacher, Nassaji and Cumming&lt;ref name="Nassaji, H. 2000" /&gt; demonstrate the power of creating conditions for a young English learner to develop language proficiency in “a complementary, dynamic, and evolving manner” (p.&amp;nbsp;113), as the teacher worked within the learner's [[zone of proximal development]] (ZPD).&lt;ref name=":17" /&gt; In a study of the dialogue journal writing of high school students in Iran over the course of a year, Ghahremani-Ghajar and Mirhosseini&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; found growth in the percentage of entries reflecting critical or creative thinking, instead of descriptive or personal references, which were prominent in the students’ early writing. In a series of studies of dialogue journal writing in university classes in Hong Kong, Guizhou, and Beijing, China, Chiesa and Bailey&lt;ref name=":19" /&gt; found that the writing was not only a language-learning task but also “a way [for the students] to grow socially, mentally, and emotionally with the support of a teacher” (p.&amp;nbsp;53). (See further discussion in the sections on Second Language Learning and Dialogue Journal Use in International Settings.)

These patterns have been described in other academic settings as well. For example, in a study of first-year students in medical school writing in dialogue journals with their professors, Ashbury, Fletcher, and Birtwhistle&lt;ref name=":29" /&gt; found that the interactive journal writing “provided a safe place for students to describe their experiences and relationships and to question their own values and beliefs.” Similar patterns are described by Lucas&lt;ref&gt;Lucas, C. (1990). Using dialogue journals in a graduate linguistics program. In J.R. Staton &amp; R.C. Johnson (Eds.), ''Conversations in writing: A guide for using dialogue journals with deaf post-secondary and secondary students.'' Washington, DC: Gallaudet University.&lt;/ref&gt; (writing in a graduate linguistics course for deaf university students), and Walworth&lt;ref&gt;Walworth, M. (1985). Dialogue journals and the teaching of reading. ''Teaching English to Deaf and Second-Language Students, 3''(1), 21-25.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Walworth, M. (1990). Interactive teaching of reading: A model. (pp. 35-47). In J.K. Peyton (Ed.), ''Students and teacher writing together: Perspectives on journal writing'' (pp. 35-47). Alexandria, VA: Teachers of English to Speakers of Other Languages.&lt;/ref&gt; (writing with deaf high school and university students). The process of writing in this way, with their teachers, broke down barriers between them, through mutual sharing of thoughts and feelings. This dynamic led to enhanced rapport and communication, facilitated students’ personal and reflective perspectives, and initiated and encouraged self-awareness.

==Second language learning==
[[File:A first grade student from Colombia, learning English.jpg|alt=Mrs. Sedei writing with Catalina, a first grade student from Colombia, learning English|thumb|Mrs. Sedei writing with Catalina, a first grade student from Colombia, learning English]]

Much of the use of and research on interactive writing takes place in the field of second language learning, whether students are learning English or another world language (Chinese, Farsi, French, Spanish, etc.) in the United States or another country. (See Casanave&lt;ref name=":33"&gt;Casanave, C.P. (2011). ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=FtDeMkVp9uIC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Journal writing in second language education].'' Ann Arbor, MI: University of Michigan Press.&lt;/ref&gt; for a summary of diverse uses of journal writing in different contexts.) The first published study of the interactive writing processes and written patterns of students learning English as an additional language was of sixth grade students in California writing with their teacher, Leslie Reed.&lt;ref name="Peyton 1993" /&gt; This study of the daily writing of these students and their teacher over the course of a school year demonstrated that young students, new to the United States and to learning English, can begin to write early in the year, and the richness and complexity of their writing develops over time. As Peyton and Staton describe, &lt;blockquote&gt;[As we read the dialogue journals] we discovered that these students ''could'' write, even though they were still learning English, and some at very beginning stages. They could use writing to communicate meaning, and most were eager to do so. We also found that the journals became an important place for making sense of the world – in many cases a new school, language, and culture. The students could ask questions about everything from Mrs. Reed’s age to the structure of an atom, worry over problems with school friends or content, and complain when things didn’t go as they thought they should.&lt;ref name=":34"&gt;Peyton, J.K. (1993). “The development of beginning writers: Six student profiles.” In J.K. Peyton &amp; J. Staton (Eds.),  ''Dialogue journals in the multilingual classroom: Building language fluency and writing skills through written interaction'' (pp. 47-99). Norwood, NJ: Ablex.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;As we analyzed the writing done throughout the year, we found that the students who were more advanced and motivated were able to break out of some of the constraints of teacher-directed classroom work and explore the limits of their English proficiency, with the teacher's entries serving as a model and guide.&lt;ref name=":34" /&gt; Some of their writing in the journals was more complex than the other writing that they did to complete class assignments.&lt;ref name=":31" /&gt; Students at the beginning stages of learning English were reluctant to write at first and wrote very little, sometimes only the date. They moved to using a specific pattern in one or two sentences (e.g., I like ____.”), until by the end of the year, they were using English constructions including articles; past, progressive, and future tense; and improved spelling (e.g., a change from ''bekes'' to ''because'').&lt;ref name=":34" /&gt; The strategies that the teacher used in her writing seemed to have an impact on the students’ written expression and writing development.&lt;ref name=":25" /&gt;

Since then, studies of dialogue journal writing (discussed below in this section) have found that it is a valuable instructional tool in language learning classes with children and adolescents, university students, and adults in adult education programs. A valuable resource is Casanave,&lt;ref name=":33" /&gt; who describes, with examples and suggestions, journal and dialogue journal writing with students writing in a second/new language – young children, high school and college students, and adults – with low proficiency, intermediate proficiency, and advanced proficiency in the language they are learning. This provides an excellent summary of these contexts and guidance for working in them. (See also sections in this article on uses of dialogue journals in international settings, where students are learning to write in additional languages. The sections on deaf education, counseling, and with students with special needs, also include children and adults learning a second or additional language, often English as an additional language.)

The writing can take place between students and the teacher or between language learners and native language speakers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Bromley K|year=1995|title=Buddy journals for ESL and native-English-speaking students|url=|journal=TESOL Journal|volume=4|issue=3|pages=7–11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cole|first1=Robert|last2=Raffier|first2=Linda Mccarthy|last3=Rogan|first3=Peter|last4=Schleicher|first4=Leigh|year=1998|title=Interactive Group Journals: Learning as a Dialogue among Learners|journal=TESOL Quarterly|volume=32|issue=3|page=556|doi=10.2307/3588126|jstor=3588126}}&lt;/ref&gt; The purposes might be overall language acquisition,&lt;ref name=":35"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Darhower M|year=2004|title=Dialogue journals as mediators of L2 learning: A sociocultural account|url=|journal=Hispania: A Journal Devoted to the Teaching of Spanish and Portuguese|volume=87|issue=2|pages=324–335|doi=10.2307/20140862|jstor=20140862}}&lt;/ref&gt; development of writing abilities,&lt;ref name=":28" /&gt; opportunities to extend learning of the language beyond time in class,&lt;ref name="waesol.org"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Lyon, C.|date=2013|title=That wasn’t homework, was it?

=== ''Dialogue Journal Writing With Children and Adolescents Learning English'' ===
[[File:A first grade student from Colombia, learning English 2.jpg|thumb|Mrs. Sedei writing with Catalina, a first grade student from Colombia, learning English]]
Nassaji and Cumming&lt;ref name="Nassaji, H. 2000" /&gt; studied 10 months of dialogue journal writing between a six-year-old Farsi speaker (‘Ali’) beginning to learn English and his teacher in Canada. They found that in the writing, both writers “acted as proficient users of English – in spite of Ali’s emergent spelling, vocabulary, syntax, and penmanship – because the dialogue journal created a ‘setting for thought’,&lt;ref&gt;Butterworth, G. (1993). “Context and cognition in models of cognitive growth.” In P. Light &amp; G. Butterworth (Eds.), ''Context and cognition: Ways of learning and knowing'' (pp. 1-13). Hillsdale, NJ: Erlbaum.&lt;/ref&gt; in which both participants reciprocally shared common knowledge, purposes, and tools of communication, evidently understanding and appreciating them” (p.&amp;nbsp;114). This process seemed to help Ali write in his second language. While he initially used one language function (reporting – of general facts, personal facts, or opinions), the teacher used a variety of language functions, thus exposing Ali to them (reporting, requesting, evaluating predicting, and giving directives). The authors state, “We assume [the teacher] was striving to scaffold her written interactions to prompt Ali’s potential for learning English in this context” (p.&amp;nbsp;104). Gradually, it seems in response to this scaffolding, Ali began to use the teacher's questioning patterns and reporting styles and to use a variety of other language functions as well.

Lipp&lt;ref&gt;Lipp, E. (2001). “Building a cross-cultural community of learners and writers through pen pal journals.” In J. Burton &amp; M. Carroll (Eds.), ''Journal writing'' (pp. 113-124). Alexandria, VA: Teachers of English to Speakers of Other Languages.&lt;/ref&gt; (2001) was teaching a Methods of TESL (Teaching of English as a Second Language) course at California State University, Fresno, for students preparing for careers as elementary school teachers. She collaborated with a third grade teacher in an elementary school in Fresno to arrange for the prospective teachers to write in “pen pal journals” with Hmong refugee children in the teacher's third grade class (children 8–9 years old). The pen pals wrote to each other once a week and also spent time together, when the university students visited the school to talk with the students and participate in special events. Four themes emerged during the course of this project: 1) crossing boundaries – elementary school children and university students, and a university professor and elementary school teacher, worked together closely for a year; 2) becoming aware of and sensitive to the broader sociological context – the university students learned to engage with the third grade students about topics the students introduced and to become interested in the lifestyle that the students described, which was very different from their own. They also developed understanding of literacy and second language learning processes; 3) empowering children as writers – The children primarily wrote narratives about their lives and activities, and some of them “used the pen pal journal as a forum to elaborate on their lives and to share stories shaped by their imagination, their gender, and their culture” (p.&amp;nbsp;121); 4) recognizing interaction as a key component of literacy – The written interaction became a regular part of the children's lives, and many of them moved from answering the university student's questions to introducing their own topics for written discussion. The chapter concludes with helpful tips for setting up and maintaining a pen pal project between children and prospective teachers.

Alexander&lt;ref&gt;Alexander, N. (2001). A long day’s journal into night: A primer on writing dialogue journals with adolescent ESL students. In J. Burton &amp; Michael Carroll (Eds.), ''Journal writing'' (pp. 23-35), Alexandria, VA: Teachers of English to Speakers of Other Languages.&lt;/ref&gt; (2001) studied the dialogue journal writing that she did with grade 6, 7, and 8 students learning English (ages 11–15) in her classes in a suburban U.S. middle school outside Chicago, Illinois. She found a number of benefits of the writing: The journals provided an excellent way for the students to practice grammar, spelling, punctuation, and handwriting in a real, communicative context. They provided a longitudinal record of the students’ growth in written English and a way for her, and the students, to notice what they were learning and how their English was developing. They also &lt;blockquote&gt;provided a personal and private connection to a trustworthy adult. At a time when teenagers report more and more alienation from the mainstream of adult society, dialogue journals are an excellent way to keep up with teens’ emotional changes and clarify information for them in a way that does not embarrass them in front of their peers. The dialogue journal provides a safe haven for building trust with an adult, naming and exploring feelings, and resolving issues. (p. 35) &lt;/blockquote&gt;Alexander includes a list of practical ideas for writing with students, including ways to adapt the teacher's writing when writing with students learning English, from low-beginning to high-beginning and intermediate levels.

In international contexts, Liao and Wong&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; studied dialogue journal writing of 41 10th grade students learning English in Taiwan. They found improvement in the students’ writing ﬂuency; writing performance on content, organization, and vocabulary; reﬂective awareness of writing and growth as learners; and motivation to write. The writing also reduced the students’ writing anxiety. The researchers reported that the writing was an important tool for self-understanding and self-growth and allowed students to consider something new; enhanced their self-conﬁdence, so that they could get along better with others; matured them through sharing their ideas, feelings, and self-perceptions; consolidated their thinking when re-reading their journals; strengthened their conﬁdence in English writing; and gave them the chance to reﬂect on their daily lives.

Jardine&lt;ref name=":36" /&gt; wrote in dialogue journals with 28 10- to 11-year-old Xhosa-speaking students in grades 4 and 5 in an English-medium school in the Western Cape of South Africa. Although the goal in the school was for the children to learn English, Jardine wanted to help them see the value of their home language (Xhosa) and use it to express themselves in writing. She wanted to investigate the dialogue journal writing process as a means of raising the status of Xhosa at the school, as well as affirm the voices of children in asymmetrical multilingual settings (where English had much more status than their home language; e.g., she found that the Xhosa speakers in the school were often considered to be “English learners rather than potentially multilingual and resourceful” p.&amp;nbsp;16). Jardine tried to move from writing English to writing in Xhosa, but most of the writing was in English. Still, she found that because of the relationships that were formed in the writing, the children were able to write in English and take risks with spelling and forms, even though their English was limited. At the same time, as they were encouraged to write in Xhosa, and as she wrote in Xhosa with them, they became more confident about writing in that language as well. “In the journal writing process, I aimed to show the children that the languages they use matter, that their voices matter, and that they matter” (p.&amp;nbsp;72). After this experience of writing in both languages, Jardine concludes that, &lt;blockquote&gt;In my view, this counter-discourse of valuing African languages, seldom expressed by parents and teachers, was the most striking language awareness response to the journal writing process. The children had come to the ideological awareness of ‘language-as-resource’ as envisaged in the South African Constitution. This heightened language awareness illustrates the potential of multilingual dialogue writing to provide children with opportunities to voice themselves in writing and ‘claim the right to speak’ (p. 70).&lt;/blockquote&gt;(For further discussion of dialogue journal writing in international contexts, see the section on ''Dialogue journal use in international settings''.)

=== ''With University Students'' ===
Studies of dialogue journal writing with university students have found that they not only provide a way for students to grow socially, mentally, and emotionally with the support of a teacher but also to connect what students are learning inside the language classroom to their experiences beyond the classroom.&lt;ref name=":19" /&gt;

Chiesa, Damerow, and Bailey&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; describe six features of pedagogical scaffolding that might be used in dialogue journal writing in university courses—continuity and coherence, supportive environment, intersubjectivity, flow, contingency, and the handover/takeover principle. They analyzed the writing of students’ dialogue journal entries and the teachers’ responses in two courses and asked: Are the six features of pedagogical scaffolding present in the students’ dialogue journal entries and the teachers’ responses? They found that continuity and coherence, supportive environment, intersubjectivity, and flow and contingency were evident throughout the writing, and some evidence of the handover/takeover principle appeared as the students’ independent ideas emerged over time.

Moulton and Holmes&lt;ref name=":16" /&gt; looked at ways that dialogue journal writing can provide a bridge for international students learning English in a college or university course that spans the chasm between cultures. In a study of ESL students in an intermediate composition class at a university over a 15-week semester, they found that the students used the dialogue journal writing to explore cultural issues as they experienced various stages of acculturation. The writing demonstrated that &lt;blockquote&gt;[The students’] feelings progressed from cultural isolation to a willingness to share cultural perspectives and, finally, to understanding and acceptance of their new culture. In the dialogue journals, the students were free from the constraints that bound their other written work and were able to use their new language expressively for their own purposes. The journals seemed to be important to the students, not for grades or the teacher’s approval, but because they alleviated some of their feelings of cultural isolation and helped them make the transition from their own cultures to a new one” (p. 21).  &lt;/blockquote&gt;The authors conclude that dialogue journal writing can allow students “to move through the stages of acculturation naturally, enhancing language acquisition in the process” (p.&amp;nbsp;22).

Dolly,&lt;ref&gt;Dolly, M.R. (1990). Adult ESL student’ management of dialogue journal conversation. ''TESOL Quarterly.'' '''24''' (2): 317-321.&lt;/ref&gt; in a study of dialogue writing between adult ESL students in an intensive English program at Indiana University of Pennsylvania's American Language Institute, found that the journals, which took place between adults (students and teacher) provided an opportunity for reciprocity, for the partners to share responsibility for conversation management – introducing and extending topics and handling communication problems. The nonnative English speakers’ role in and contributions to the interaction became as important as those of the native English speaker.

Dialogue journal use as a tool to promote language learning has not been confined to the learning of English. For example, Darhower&lt;ref name=":35" /&gt; used them in an intermediate college Spanish class and found that the students used the writing to reflect on their experiences learning Spanish, consolidate information about topics covered in class, and use language functions that have been introduced and covered in class.

=== ''With Adults in Adult Education Programs'' ===
Dialogue journal writing has been used extensively in adult education classes for students learning English, from beginning to advanced levels of English proficiency and literacy, and the benefits described are rich and complex.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

Talburt&lt;ref name="Talburt, S. 1995" /&gt;  wrote in dialogue journals for 16 weeks with her students who were refugee women from Russia, in an Advanced Grammar class in an adult ESL program. In her analysis of the writing with one student, “Marina” (a 25-year-old woman from Moscow who had finished a university degree in the sciences when living there), Talburt found that the journal gave Marina a place where she was confident expressing her identity and her thoughts about many issues. This reinforced Marina's sense that she could understand and be understood by Americans and communicate with them beyond superficial levels, which she didn’t have when she arrived. At one point Marina wrote,&lt;blockquote&gt;You asked me about my feelings about the jornal. I like it very much, I enjoy doing that. Now it’s part of my life. If it stops, I’ll lose something very important for me. … The last 2 or 3 times I write it at night. I love these few hours when nobody and nothing distract me and I can think in silence. (p. 67)&lt;/blockquote&gt;Larrotta&lt;ref&gt;Larrotta, C. (2008). “Written conversations with Hispanic adults developing English literacy.” ''Adult Basic Education and Literacy Journal''. '''2''' (1): 13-23.&lt;/ref&gt; (2008) kept dialogue journals with 17 Spanish-speaking adults in an intermediate ESL literacy class in a community literacy program in Central Texas. The students, who had, in other classes, been trained to write very controlled compositions and sentences, were at first nervous about writing in English. Some of them had rarely written more than two sentences on the same topic, and some had very little experience writing in their native language. She found, over the semester of writing together, that the students enjoyed the writing and considered it to be an effective learning tool; found it easy to introduce topics to write about (rather than relying on her to introduce topics); believed that it was a good way to bridge cultural and personal gaps and discuss cultural differences; and progressed in their writing, from simple sentences or lists of words to communicating ideas in extended texts. She concludes, “It was rewarding for me to see the students’ faces and observe their body language responses when I gave the journals back to them. ... I could see them reading my entries and making faces, laughing, looking for words in the dictionary, or asking questions about the message in the journal. This made me think that the dialogue journal was a useful and rewarding pedagogical tool for all of us” (p.&amp;nbsp;21). The article includes helpful guidelines for teachers using dialogue journal writing with this adult learner population.

Kim&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Kim J|year=2005|title=A community within the classroom: Dialogue journal writing of adult ESL learners|url=|journal=Adult Basic Education|volume=15|issue=1|pages=21–32}}&lt;/ref&gt; had a similar experience to that of Larotta. Writing with adult ESL learners in a community-based adult basic education program in the Southwestern United States, she found that while the adult learners engaged in meaningful dialogue and social interaction in writing, they had the opportunity to both share their own culture and to learn about a new culture. They also developed [[critical literacy]], the opportunity to think critically about the social and cultural contexts of language and learning rather than simply mastering specific skills.

Vanett and Jurich,&lt;ref&gt;Vanette, L., &amp; Jurich, D. (1990). “The missing link: Connecting journal writing to academic writing.” In J.K. Peyton &amp; J. Staton (Eds.), ''Students and teachers writing together: Perspectives on journal writing'' (23–33). Alexandria, VA: TESOL.&lt;/ref&gt; writing with adult learners in an ESL program, found that when adult learners gain confidence as writers, they become autonomous learners, are motivated to express themselves in writing, and can move into the types of writing expected in academic contexts, about many different topics and in many different genres and styles.

Dialogue journal writing has also been used successfully with adults with extremely limited literacy skills, who, at the beginning, may know the alphabet, be able to write their name, and, with difficulty, write a few sentences in their native language (Spanish) but have no writing ability in English. Spener&lt;ref&gt;Spener, D. (1996). “Getting started: Dialogue journal writing with semiliterate adult ESL students.” In J.K. Peyton &amp; J. Staton (Eds.), ''Writing our lives: Reflections on dialogue writing with adults learning English'' (pp. 79-88). McHenry, IL &amp; Washington, D.C.: Delta Systems &amp; Center for Applied Linguistics.&lt;/ref&gt; in an 8-week course with adults at this level, after several rather unsuccessful attempts to interact in writing in ways that engaged the students, found that when he took a specific approach, genuine interaction in writing occurred, students were engaged, and their writing developed. His approach included interacting with the students orally first, so that  he and the students knew each other; gradually moving toward independent writing, without initial oral interaction; ensuring that the written dialogue was at the student's levels, so they had the satisfaction of reading and writing successfully; and providing time for the writing to take place, so that the students don’t feel rushed.

Adult education teachers work with a diverse group of learners, many of whom have many responsibilities in their lives in addition to coming to English class and may rotate into and out of classes frequently. As a result, the writing can be challenging. For example, Fallon&lt;ref name=":32" /&gt; worked with five basic literacy students at a learning center in rural south-central New York. All of the students found it difficult to read. Fallon conducted the dialogue journal writing in a computer lab, so that the students could become familiar with the technology. Written dialogue, on computers, seemed ideal for a number of reasons. However, after a year of engaging in this writing, Fallon found that he was not seeing the writing and reading development that he had hoped to see, and “our dialogue had become stagnant” (p.&amp;nbsp;139). After reviewing the theoretical discussions of learning and dialogue by Mikhail Bakhtin&lt;ref&gt;Bakhtin, M. (1981). “Discourse in the novel. In M. Holquist (Ed.), ''The dialogue imagination: Four essays by Mikhail Bakhtin'' (pp. 259-422). University of Texas Slavic Series. Austin, TX: University of Texas Press.&lt;/ref&gt; (1981) and Paulo Freire,&lt;ref&gt;Freire, P. (1970/2007). ''Pedagogy of the oppressed.'' New York: Continuum. [[Pedagogy of the Oppressed|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pedagogy_of_the_Oppressed]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Freire, P. (1973). ''Education for critical consciousness.'' New York: Seabury.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":30" /&gt; Fallon concluded that the notion of [[Dialogue|authentic dialogue]] is critical to effective written interaction. This includes shared responsiveness, where both partners engage in asking and answering, the content focuses on generative themes that are of interest and importance to the learners, and the writing is connected with other written texts (including letters or newspaper articles). In summary, effective interaction with adult learners requires specific understanding, focus, and engagement by the teacher.

Orem&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Orem R|year=2001|title=Journal writing in adult ESL: Improving practice through reflective writing|url=|journal=New Directions for Adult and Continuing Education|volume=90|issue=|pages=69–78}}&lt;/ref&gt; also points out possible challenges with writing with adult learners who, in this confidential context, may write about problems in the workplace (including harassment and documentation), at home (including domestic violence), and the community (including police profiling). They also may write about health issues and challenges in schools that their children attend. He points out that teachers need to be prepared to respond authentically and in confidence. He concludes by pointing out that this written interaction provides an excellent opportunity to engage in [[Problem-posing education|problem posing]],&lt;ref&gt;Norton, B. (1998). “Using journals in second language research and teaching.” In T. Smoke (Ed.), ''Adult ESL: Politics, pedagogy, and participation in classroom and community programs.''

(See also Paulo Friere, ''[[Pedagogy of the Oppressed]],'' 1970, updated 2007, for discussion of the importance of authentic dialogue.)

==Deaf education==
Dialogue journals have become an accepted practice at all levels of deaf education since 1982, when the Linguistics Research Laboratory, directed by [[William Stokoe|Dr. William Stokoe]], created the Gallaudet Dialogue Journal Research Project and brought Dr. Jana Staton to introduce the practice to teachers and instructors at [http://www.gallaudet.edu/kdes.html Kendall Demonstration Elementary School (KDES)], [http://www.gallaudet.edu/mssd.html Model Secondary School for the Deaf], and [[Gallaudet University]]. From this initial project, the use of dialogue journals has become an accepted practice in English literacy education for deaf and hard of hearing students (hereinafter “deaf”). The [http://www.gallaudet.edu/clerc-center.html Laurent Clerc National Deaf Education Center] identifies dialogue journals as one of nine "best practices" for a comprehensive [http://www3.gallaudet.edu/clerc-center/info-to-go/literacy/literacy-it-all-connects.html communication-based literacy approach for deaf students],&lt;ref&gt;''Literacy: It all connects.''

In the 1980s, before the Internet and widespread email and texting made interactive, written communication accessible, [https://goldin-meadow-lab.uchicago.edu/sites/goldin-meadow-lab.uchicago.edu/files/uploads/PDFs/2001_GM_Mayberry.pdf profoundly deaf] students were largely shut out of functional, meaningful, personally directed writing in school settings. Writing instruction was often largely a matter of rote copying from the blackboard.&lt;ref&gt;Hamermeister, F.K. &amp; Israelite, N.K. (1983). Reading instruction for the hearing impaired: An integrated language arts approach. ''The Volta Review,'' '''85'''(3), 136-148.&lt;/ref&gt; The tested reading and writing levels of many students has, for decades, seemed to plateau at upper elementary school&lt;ref&gt;Gallaudet Research Brief #4.

A practice involving functional written conversations with a teacher in the school context was a marked addition to instructional practice.

Staton and colleagues,&lt;ref name=":41"&gt;Bailes, C., Searls, S., Slobodzian, J., &amp; Staton, J. (1986). ''&lt;nowiki&gt;''&lt;/nowiki&gt;It's your turn now!" Using dialogue journals with deaf students.'' Washington, DC: Gallaudet Pre‑College Outreach Programs. (Available from Kendall Demonstration Elementary School, 800 Florida Avenue NE, Washington, DC 20002). 
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":40"&gt;Bailes, C. (1999). Dialogue journals: Fellowship, conversation, and English modeling. ''Perspectives in Education and Deafness'', ''17,'' 5.&lt;/ref&gt; studied the initial years of dialogue journal use between deaf students and teachers in elementary and secondary school and found three potential outcomes:

a)     Initiation of students into functional use of written English through natural dialogue, providing well-formed and sufficient written input for [https://goldin-meadow-lab.uchicago.edu/sites/goldin-meadow-lab.uchicago.edu/files/uploads/PDFs/2001_GM_Mayberry.pdf profoundly deaf] students, in line with optimal [[Theories of second-language acquisition|second language acquisition theory]].&lt;ref&gt;Krashen, S. D. (1982). ''Principles and practice in second language acquisition.'' Upper Saddle River, NJ: Prentice-Hall.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Krashen, A.D. (1988). ''Second language acquisition and second language learning''. Upper Saddle River, NJ: Prentice-Hall.&lt;/ref&gt;

b)     Creation of understanding and rapport between teachers and students, which is especially important when the teacher has normal hearing and may not be proficient in ASL as a second language.

c)     Engagement of students in cognitively demanding interactions in written English that reflect their actual cognitive maturity.

Other studies of dialogue journal use with deaf students at older ages, including in college, reviewed below, reflect similar results. These initial studies were observational in nature. No comparison groups without dialogue journal use were available to compare the impact on students’ written language development.

=== ''Functional Uses of Written Language'' ===
Bailes et al.&lt;ref name=":41" /&gt; found that elementary school students who were the least proficient in written English at the beginning of the academic year (mostly children from hearing families without [[American Sign Language|American Sign Language (ASL)]] as a first language) caught up with more proficient ASL signers by the end of the year. They were able to introduce and elaborate on their own topics rather than just respond to the teacher's topics and used a wider range of language functions, even as they continued to be unwilling to participate in other class reading and writing activities. Bailes et al.&lt;ref name=":41" /&gt; analyzed the movement of students in two classes from fall to spring, from drawing and one-word responses to syntactic representation of ideas. They found that 33% of fall entries were drawing, with only 10% having recognizable English syntax. In the spring, 70% of entries had complete syntactic representation of meaning (“I went to see the zoo.”), and there were no drawings. All of the students were in an optimal, language-rich print environment at Kendall Demonstration Elementary School, but the dialogue journal use appears to have engaged them in written English use more effectively than did other classroom assignments.

At the time of the first dialogue journal use at [[Gallaudet University]] (1982-1984) and at the [http://www.ntid.rit.edu/ National Technical Institute for the Deaf (NTID)] (1980-1990), many students entered post-secondary education with very rudimentary written language competence in English&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;  and often were not proficient in ASL.&lt;ref name=":42"&gt;Cannon, B., &amp; Polio, C. (1989). An analysis of input and interaction in the dialogue journals of deaf community college students. ''Teaching English to Deaf and Second Language Students'', '''7'''(1), 12-21.&lt;/ref&gt; Studies of their dialogue journals focused on and provide evidence for the growth of communicative competence in English through interactive written conversations. Among the critical aspects of emerging writing competence were organization and coherence in writing at the discourse level,&lt;ref name=":27" /&gt; paragraph development,&lt;ref name=":43"&gt;Albertini, J., &amp; Meath-Lang, B. (1986). Analysis of student-teacher exchanges in dialogue journal writing. ''Journal of Curriculum Theorizing,'' '''7''''','' 1-14&lt;/ref&gt; and increased length and comprehensibility of responses.&lt;ref name=":42" /&gt; Even in a brief time period (10 weeks), Albertini and Meath-Lang&lt;ref name=":43" /&gt; observed a marked growth in the use of [http://www-01.sil.org/linguistics/glossaryoflinguisticterms/WhatIsPragmatics.htm pragmatic language functions] needed for communication in social contexts, beyond simple description. Student entries by older students moved from short, careful, declarative sentences (called “Baby English” by students, according to Staton&lt;ref name=":44"&gt;Staton, J. (1985). Using dialogue journals for developing thinking, reading, and writing with hearing-impaired students. ''Volta Review,'' '''7'''(5), 127-154.&lt;/ref&gt;) toward the full range of language functions in English that are the mark of a competent English user – including questioning, complaining, predicting, promising, and threatening. This range of language functions that dialogue journals—rather uniquely—call forth reflects the cognitive interests and maturity of the writer. One study with younger deaf students (9–12 years old) found a modest increase in syntactic correctness and word usage over 24 weeks,&lt;ref&gt;Lieberth, A.K. (1991). The use of scaffolded dialogue journals to teach writing to deaf students. ''Teaching English to Deaf and Second-Language Students,'' '''9'''(1), 10-13.&lt;/ref&gt; but again, there was no comparison group receiving the same classroom instruction.

In Germany, an education professor introduced dialogue journals to her teacher candidates, and then studied her students‘ dialogues with their deaf elementary school students, students with special needs, and adults with limited literacy during their practica.&lt;ref&gt;Schlenker-Schulte, C., Oelze, V., &amp; Wagner, S. (2016). Dialog-Journale als Möglichkeit zur Schriftsprach-Diagnostik und –Förderung in heterogenen Lerngruppen [Dialogue Journals as a means of promoting and assessing written language in heterogeneous classes].

Dialog-Journale schreiben mit Schülerinnen und Schülern der ältesten Sprachheilschule Deutschlands. ''Praxis Sprache,'' '''61''', 85-89.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wagner, S. &amp; Schlenker-Schulte, C. (2005a). Dialog- Journale – ein neuer Ansatz für die Alphabetisierung? [Dialogue journals: a new approach for learning to read and write?]. In ''Bundesverband Alphabetisierung: Alphabetisierung – Kultur – Wirtschaft'', 125-132. Stuttgart: Ernst Klett Sprachen.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wagner, S. &amp; Schlenker-Schulte, C. (2005b). Mit Herz und Verstand: Schreiben lernen durch Dialog-Journale [With heart and mind: Learning to write through dialogue journals]''.'' In ''Alfa Forum. Zeitschrift für Alphabetisierung und Grundbildung'', '''18,''' 25-28.&lt;/ref&gt; Among the findings of this research were that children with speech and language delay learned to ask questions and pay attention to word choice and spelling; children with severe cognitive delay and little or no experience with writing began to respond to written prompts and label pictures; and adult with limited literacy, who had had unpleasant experiences with formal learning, expressed a desire to learn to read and write after using dialogue journals.

More recently, research on dialogue journal use in Myanmar with deaf adults&lt;ref&gt;Albertini, J., Eilers-crandall, K., Sarchet, T. &amp; Albertini, K. B. (2016). Englischunterricht mit Gehörlosen in Myanmar: Fokus auf Interaktion und Dialog [Teaching English to deaf adults in Myanmar: A focus on interaction and dialogue]. ''Praxis Sprache,'' '''61,''' 90-97.&lt;/ref&gt; noted that dialogue journal writing was an effective means of communicating one-on-one with students who had varying English language skills and normally communicated in a Myanmar sign language or spoken Burmese. Using entries on family life, school, and work, students were able to construct short autobiographies that could be shared with their classmates.

=== ''Understanding, Rapport, and Motivation'' ===
Students at Gallaudet University reported valuing most the relationship with their instructor and the quality of the instructor's comments -- “honesty,” “interest in my ideas,” and “trust.” Students valued the opportunity to read and to write back in authentic exchanges, which is particularly important for those for whom written English has not been a meaningful language experience. Staton&lt;ref&gt;Staton, J. (1990). Studies of dialogue journal use at Gallaudet. Chapter 4. ''Conversations in writing: A guide for using dialogue journals with deaf post-secondary and secondary students''. (GRI Monograph Series B, No. 4). Washington, DC: Gallaudet Research Institute, Gallaudet University.&lt;/ref&gt; also noted that students from classes in which the instructors had chosen to use dialogue journals with high frequency (2-3 times per week) were twice as likely to re-enroll in English classes the following year and had lower dropout rates. This correlation cannot be attributed solely to dialogue journal use, as no untreated group of students with the same teachers existed for comparison, and thus teacher selection effects cannot be ruled out.

Meath-Lang&lt;ref&gt;Meath-Lang, B. (1990). The dialogue journal: Reconceiving curriculum and teaching. In J. K. Peyton (Ed.), ''Students and teachers writing together: Perspectives on journal writing'' (pp. 5-17). Alexandria, VA: Teachers of English to Speakers of Other Languages.&lt;/ref&gt; pointed out that the interactive conversations create a truly student-centered language program, in which students have a voice in reconceiving and directing the curriculum itself and develop real control over their communication.

=== ''Development of Cognitive Skills Through Interactional Scaffolding'' ===
The third potential outcome of dialogue journal use, development of cognitive skills, is mediated through the interactional scaffolding provided by the teacher's responses to student ideas and topics.&lt;ref name=":44" /&gt; Here the importance of having a motivated, committed teacher as an interactional partner is clear. Teachers readily use higher-order cognitive skills involved in comprehending information, such as comparing, evaluating, giving examples, predicting, requesting clarification, and elaboration. The Gallaudet report, ''Conversations in Writing: A Guide for Using Dialogue Journals''&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; includes reflections from Gallaudet University faculty on the value of their dialogue journal use in upper-division classes for developing [[Dialogue journal#Outcomes Research|engagement]] and cognitively demanding exchanges in topic areas, geared to individual students’ actual cognitive maturity, rather than (often minimal) writing competence.

At Gallaudet, dialogue journal use with college preparatory students showed that with optimal conditions (a motivated teacher and frequent interactions [2-3 exchanges weekly]), student entries showed the development of important new skills in fluent written competence, including introducing their own topics, elaborating, responding to instructor questions, and expanding their range of language functions.&lt;ref name=":37" /&gt; Students began writing about the same topic across several turns and became collaborative, interested conversational partners in written English. Walworth&lt;ref name=":38" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":39" /&gt; described the value of dialogue journals for developing her college students’ advanced reading skills in a literature course, summarized in this Wikipedia article, in the section on [[Dialogue journal#Reading|Reading.]]

=== ''Uses in Different Contexts'' ===
Kluwin&lt;ref&gt;Kluwin, T.N. (1996). Getting hearing and deaf students to write to each other through dialogue journals. ''Teaching Exceptional Children,'' '''28'''(2), 50-53.&lt;/ref&gt; and Kluwin and Kelly&lt;ref&gt;Kluwin, T.N., &amp; Kelly, A. (1991). The effectiveness of dialogue journal writing in improving the writing skills of young deaf writers. ''American Annals of the Deaf'', '''136'''(3), 284-291.&lt;/ref&gt; conducted a large-scale research project that paired deaf students with hearing peers as dialogue journal partners, seeking a more “realistic” practice by eliminating the time for the teacher to correspond with all students in a class. The writing ability of the hearing student partners was thought to provide the needed competence for maintaining a written conversation with middle and high school deaf students, whose reading and writing abilities in English were much lower. Kluwin's goal was to determine if dialogue journal use would improve deaf students’ written English skills, as measured by sentence complexity. He observed that growth of sentence complexity was a function of the length and “tone” (defined as expressions of mutual interest and engagement) of the relationship. However, the students involved were in different classes, were paired somewhat randomly, and had no other contact with each other apart from the journal writing. The interactions were, thus, limited by the lack of shared context, motivation to interact with each other, and active teacher involvement. Most of the 204 pairs did not correspond beyond 10-12 exchanges; only 10% of the pairs reached 22-40 exchanges.

Trent Batson, a faculty member in the English Department at Gallaudet University, describes his entrée into the use of computers for dialogue journal writing with deaf university students (in the early 1980s), which he found to be transformational.&lt;ref&gt;Batson, T. (1990). A pilgrimage from pencil to cursor: Dialoguing on computer. In J. Staton (Ed.), ''Conversations in writing: A guide for using dialogue journals with deaf post-secondary and secondary students'' (pp. 32-35). (GRI Monograph Series B, No. 4). Washington, DC: Gallaudet Research Institute, Gallaudet University.&lt;/ref&gt; He found that on the computer, he was much more authentic and engaged, the students were engaged, they had an ongoing record of their (increasingly longer and more complex) interactions, and they found themselves writing more freely and openly and revising what they wrote. Some of the students said that the dialogue journal was the best part of the course. Later, Batson took the concept of interactive writing into his entire class, establishing a computer network on which his English classes with deaf students were taught entirely in English.&lt;ref&gt;Peyton, J.K., &amp; Batson, T. (1986). Computer networking: Making connections between speech and writing. ''ERIC/CLL News Bulletin,'' '''10'''(1).&lt;/ref&gt; Before the computer network was in place, his English classes, like all classes at Gallaudet, were taught in ASL, and the writing that students did was only on assigned essays. Through the computer network, Batson made interactive uses of English available to deaf students.

Here we see two very different adaptations of dialogue journal writing, with very different outcomes. It is clear that the role of an engaged, motivated teacher is critical to the journals’ success.

==Counseling==
One of the many values of dialogue journals is the opportunity for teachers to provide informal counseling in a non-threatening, private context for individual students on their challenges and problems, whether about instructional or personal concerns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/1995/09/18/writing-down-secrets|title=Writing down secrets|author=Mosle, S.|date=1995|newspaper=[[The New Yorker]]|pages=52–61}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":45" /&gt; This use is closest to the goal and practice of Mrs. Reed,&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt; the original 6th grade teacher who had taken training with [[William Glasser|Dr. William Glasser]] on [http://www.wglasser.com/the-glasser-approach/reality-therapy Reality Therapy] for classroom teachers.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":37" /&gt; The training led her to use the private written conversations to model the pragmatic, problem-solving perspective of Reality Therapy and to encourage students to think through issues and problems with her guidance. Of her writing with the students, she said, “I cannot think of any better way to learn so much about my students, myself, and my own teaching".&lt;ref&gt;Reed, L. (1993). Opening the door to communication in the multilingual/multicultural classroom. Chapter 2 in J.K. Peyton &amp; J. Staton (Eds.), ''Dialogue journals in the multilingual classroom: Building fluency and writing skills through written interaction'' (pp. 29-46). Norwood, NJ: Ablex.&lt;/ref&gt;

Studies of dialogue journal use with special needs students (reviewed in another sections of this Article) have focused on their role in helping students handle emotions, conflicts, and frustrations and build trust with adults as crucial goals of their educational development.&lt;ref name=":46" /&gt;

When dialogue journals are used with adult students in second language settings, and also in teacher preparation, personal and family concerns tend to dominate the topics introduced by both instructor and students, such as the trauma of migration for new immigrants.&lt;ref name="Talburt, S. 1995" /&gt;  Anderson, Nelson, Richardson, Webb, &amp; Young&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; found some positive outcomes of dialogue journal use for middle school students at risk of academic failure, social isolation, and dropping out of school. A unique use of dialogue journals with adolescents in an HIV/STI prevention program found that the individualized written interactions helped assess participants' understanding and internalization of information in a way that addressed unsafe behavior, built trust, and engaged those who were less likely to participate in class discussions.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;

==Students with special needs==
Students with special needs struggle not only with writing and reading acquisition, but with social and emotional development and confidence about their writing.&lt;ref&gt;Staton, J., &amp; Tyler, D. (1987). Dialogue journal use with learning-disabled students. ''The Pointer'', pp. 4-8.&lt;/ref&gt; Dialogue journals as an individualized means of private, mutual communication can provide students with support in handling emotions, conflicts, and frustrations.&lt;ref name=":46"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Regan, K.S.|date=2003|title=Using dialogue journals in the classroom: Forming relationships with students with emotional disturbances|journal=Teaching Exceptional Children|volume=36 | issue = 2 |pages=36–41|url=http://search.proquest.com/openview/fe30385276463b939b562848c8baa30c/1?pq-origsite=gscholar&amp;cbl=2030482|doi=10.1177/004005990303600205}}&lt;/ref&gt; For students with limited writing confidence and proficiency, the opportunity to express ideas and thoughts with teacher elaboration and modeling, and without correction, has been shown to increase their time on task, writing length, and writing quality.&lt;ref name=":14"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Regan, K.S.|author2=Mastropiere, M.A.|author3=Scruggs, T.E.|date=2005|title=Promoting expressive writing among students with emotional and behavioral disturbance via dialogue journals|journal=Behavioral Disorders|volume=31 | issue = 1 |pages=33–50|jstor=23890399}}&lt;/ref&gt; Using a single-subject baseline and intervention design, Anderson, Nelson, Richardson, Webb, and Young&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; explored the value of dialogue journals in developing a more supportive student-teacher relationship with emotionally and behaviorally challenged middle school students.

A case study of dialogue journal writing with a young gifted child&lt;ref&gt;Farley, J.W., &amp; Farley, S.L. (1987). Interactive writing and gifted children: Communication through literacy. ''Journal for the Education of the gifted, X'' (2), 99-106.&lt;/ref&gt; points out that the learning styles of gifted children (rapid development, open exploration, self-motivated, dislike of rote drills) are uniquely compatible with the dynamic communication that is possible in dialogue journals. Armstrong&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Armstrong, D.C.|date=1994|title=A gifted child's education requires real dialogue: The use of interactive writing for collaborative education |journal=Gifted Child Quarterly|volume=38|issue=3|page=136|url=http://gcq.sagepub.com/content/38/3/136.abstract|doi=10.1177/001698629403800307}}&lt;/ref&gt; studied the importance of teachers learning to use a wide variety of language functions to create shared mutuality and engage gifted students in written communication.

==Instructional strategies==
A number of publications have outlined clearly instructional strategies that teachers can use to implement dialogue journal interaction effectively, both in writing and orally. The strategies that teachers use depend on the age of the students, their proficiency in the language of the interaction, and the purposes of the class and the interaction. The teacher's strategies may also be designed to affect the students’ language use and learning.

Instructional strategies include establishing a culture of interactive writing by introducing the idea to students (continuous writing throughout the semester or school year); emphasizing that this is authentic communication and not for the purposes of correction or a grade; and describing the form that the interaction will take place (e.g., in a notebook, on a computer, through email), how often the interactions will take place (e.g., each day, once a week), and the topics or themes that will be the focus (if there are specific topics or themes).&lt;ref&gt;Bailes, C., Searles, S., Slobodzian, J., &amp; Staton, J.

==Teacher professional development==
[[File:Teacher and teacher professional developer writing about an article.jpg|alt=Teacher and teacher professional developer writing about an article they have read about teaching|thumb|Teacher and teacher professional developer writing about an article they have read about teaching]]
Dialogue journal writing has become an important component of professional development for teachers in both pre-service teacher training programs at universities and in in-service workshops and coaching. It might take place between the professor and a class of prospective teachers in a teacher preparation program; between prospective or new teachers and experienced teachers they are working with, as a mentoring and coaching opportunity; or between prospective and practicing teachers. Those who use and study these approaches have found that these professional conversations&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nesacenter.org/uploaded/conferences/FLC/2010/spkr_handouts/Danielson/TalkingAboutTeaching.pdf |format=PDF |title=Talking About Teaching : Professional Conversations to Promote Teacher Learning |website=Nesacenter.org |accessdate=2017-07-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; promote reflection on oneself as a teacher&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Roderick J.A. | year = 1986 | title = Dialogue writing: Context for reflecting on self as teacher and researcher | url = | journal = Journal of Curriculum and Supervision | volume = 1 | issue = 4| pages = 305–315 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and between teachers as they reflect on their practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Burton, J.|author2=Quirke, P.|author3=Reichmann, C.|author4=Peyton, J.K.|date=2010|title=Reflective writing: A way to lifelong teacher learning|journal=TESL-EJ Online Journal|url=http://tesl-ej.org/books/reflective_writing.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Dong Y.R. | year = 1997 | title = Collective reflection: Using peer responses to dialogue journals in teacher education | url = | journal = TESOL Journal | volume = 7 | issue = 2| pages = 26–31 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Lee, I.|date=2008|title=Fostering preservice reflection through response journals|journal=Teacher Education Quarterly|volume=35|pages=117–139|url=http://www.teqjournal.org/Back%20Issues/Volume%2035/VOL35%20PDFS/35_1/15lee-35_1.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Roderick J.A., Berman L.M. | year = 1984 | title = Dialoguing about dialogue journals | url = | journal = Language Arts | volume = 61 | issue = 7| pages = 686–692 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some research focuses on the types of responses and interactions that are effective for promoting teacher learning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Brinton D.M., Holten C.A., Goodwin J.M. | year = 1993 | title = Responding to dialogue journals in teacher preparation: What's effective? | url = | journal = TESOL Journal | volume = 2 | issue = 4| pages = 15–25 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Holten C.A., Brinton D.M. | year = 1995 | title = "You shoulda been there": Charting novice teacher growth using dialogue journals | url = | journal = TESOL Journal | volume = 4 | issue = 4| pages = 23–26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Lee, I. |date=2004|title=Using dialogue journals as a multi-purpose tool for preservice teacher preparation: How effective is it?|journal=Teacher Education Quarterly|volume=31 | issue = 3 |pages=73–97|url=http://www.teqjournal.org/backvols/2004/31_3/lee.pmd.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; With use of the Internet, these interactions can take place among educators around the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Peyton, J.K. |date=2010|title=Building an international community of scholars and practitioners through e-mail journaling|editor1=J.

==Dialogue journal use in international settings==
While the use of dialogue journal writing in educational settings originated in the United States, it is used around the world to promote writing and critical thinking. It is most frequently used to promote learning of English as a second language.

==Outcomes research==
Research and ethnographic observations have stressed the value of dialogue journals for increasing student engagement and motivation in the classroom. In that context, a recent meta-analysis&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Roorda D.L., Koomen H.M.Y., Spilt J.L., Oort F.J. | year = 2011 | title = The influence of affective teacher-student relationships on students' school engagement and achievement: A meta-analytic approach | url = | journal = Review of Educational Research | volume = 8 | issue = 4| pages = 493–529 | doi=10.3102/0034654311421793}}&lt;/ref&gt; is relevant. The analysis found that student-teacher relationships (positive and negative) had a strong association with student engagement and a small to medium effect size associated with student achievement.  Thus, as dialogue journals are known and valued for creating and improving teacher-student relationships, their positive value in increasing engagement, and therefore achievement (even modestly), may be assumed.

To support and verify such assumptions about dialogue journal writing, studies will need to provide for random assignment of students to either dialogue journal writing or a control condition for a sufficient length of time, ideally within the same instructional context. Where this is not possible, carefully designed studies of individual students can yield strong research evidence. For example, Regan, Mastropiere, and Scruggs&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt; conducted a study of special-needs students using a multiple baseline design to measure outcomes of a dialogue journal intervention compared to baseline data. Studies following this design can provide a model of dialogue journal research that addresses issues of selection and maturation.

'''''Don Winslow of the Navy''''' was an American [[comic strip]] created by [[Frank Victor Martinek]] and distributed mostly by the [[Bell Syndicate]] from 1934 to 1955. The title character was a spy-chasing [[lieutenant commander]] in [[Naval intelligence]]. The comic strip led to a [[Radio serial|radio adventure serial]] that began in 1937, as well as  [[film serial]]s that began in 1942. Original [[comic book]] stories also appeared in [[Fawcett Comics]] titles starting in 1943.

==Publication history==
The idea for ''Don Winslow'' was conceived by Lieutenant Commander Frank V. Martinek, [[USNR]],&lt;ref name=sshv/&gt; himself a storied veteran of [[World War I]] [[Naval intelligence]], after Admiral Wat T. Cluverius{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} complained to him about the difficulties of recruiting in the Midwest.&lt;ref name="sshv"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lalumiere|first1=Claude|title=Super Stories of Heroes &amp; Villains|date=2013|publisher=Tachyon Publications|isbn=9781616961541|page=305|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mZRuAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA305&amp;dq=%22Don+Winslow+of+the+Navy%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiipcrgr4XWAhWG7YMKHR2SD-4Q6AEIMTAC#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Don%20Winslow%20of%20the%20Navy%22&amp;f=false|accessdate=2 September 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ruminating on the challenge, Martinek decided that a comic strip that focused on Naval tradition and courage would educate and fascinate America’s youth.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} He had previously used the character Don Winslow in some novels he wrote, so he had the main concept readymade. Colonel [[Frank Knox]], later [[Secretary of the Navy]] helped sell the idea to the Bell Syndicate.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}

Martinek brought in Naval Lieutenant Leon Beroth as art director and Carl Hammond to handle layouts and research. Martinek articulated this central principle: "Since ''Don Winslow of the Navy'' is approved by the Navy Department, I cannot allow him to do anything that is contrary to the ideals, traditions or motives of the Navy."&lt;ref&gt;Sheridan, Martin. ''Comics and Their Creators''. Westport, CT. Hyperion Press Inc. Reprint Ed., 1977. p. 128.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://lambiek.net/artists/b/beroth_leon.htm Lambiek: Leon Beroth]&lt;/ref&gt;

The strip debuted on March 5, 1934. A Sunday page was added in 1935. Martinek supervised the daily feature’s "general tone and direction", sending the typewritten continuity to Beroth every week for illustrations. From 1934 to 1952, Beroth was the leading artist on the feature. [[Ken Ernst]] (later famous for ''[[Mary Worth]]''), assisted or ghosted the art between 1940 and 1942. With Don leaving his fiancée behind in December 1941 to go fight the Japanese, the [[World War II]] period saw the height of ''Don Winslow''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s popularity.

The [[Bell-McClure Syndicate]] dropped the strip in 1953, and it was picked up by [[General Features]], where it was illustrated by John Jordan.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bailsprojects.com/bio.aspx?Name=JORDAN%2c+JOHN+1 Jordan entry], ''Who's Who of American Comic Books: 1928–1999''. Accessed Oct, 25, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;  The strip finally came to a close on Saturday, July 30, 1955.&lt;ref name=waugh/&gt;

== Story and characters ==
Don's best pal throughout the run of the series was the somewhat chubby Red Pennington. His commanding officer for a time was Admiral Colby. Mercedes Colby, the Admiral's daughter, was Don's romantic interest for the first half of the narrative, from 1935 to 1946. Mercedes was a war nurse and in a rare instance of realism returned to the states in 1944 suffering from "war trauma." Jane Steele, a captain in the WAVES joins Don and many an adventure beginning in 1951 and Mary Winlsow joins her brother in the good fight in 1952.&lt;ref&gt;"Don Winslow of the Navy" by Mark Carlson-Ghost [http://www.markcarlson-ghost.com/index.php/2017/07/30/don-winslow-of-the-navy-comic-strip/] retrieved on 9/30/2017&lt;/ref&gt;

The Scorpion vexed Don Winslow from the very beginning of the comic strip, often behind the scenes and unseen for long periods of time. That said, he was a memorable villain, head of a global, extra-national organization of espionage and sabotage called Scorpia. Time in Tibet allowed him to develop a variety of abilities, including on at least two occasions having his spirit leave his body and permanently possess another new one. He had a daughter, Madame Mask (1937, 1950), who was just as evil but not quite as persistent. The Scorpion favored beautiful associates, including Lotus (1934–36, 1941, 1943) who later reformed, Tasmia (1936–37, 1940, 1946), and Asmara (1940–42). Agents of Scorpia in the 1930s included the Crocodile  (1936), Dr. Thor (1937), and the Duchess (1937); in the 1940s: The Duster (1948), the Polecat (1948), and Cold Shivers (1949); and in the 1950s: Half-Dome (1951), Eight Ball (1951), and the Red Vulture (1952). Efforts to create new menaces other than Scorpia were generally short-lived, but included Owl-Eyes (1939, 1949), and clandestine organizations such as The Panther's Claw (1943) and the Clenched Fist (1944).&lt;ref&gt;Carlson-Ghost, Mark.

== Legacy ==
Although created primarily as a Navy recruitment and [[propaganda]] tool, the strip received high marks from [[Coulton Waugh]] for “excellent suspense, and ingenious, spine-joggling situations.” [[Ron Goulart]] credits ''Don Winslow'' with "intrigue, spychasing, beautiful women, and villains with names like Dr. Centaur, the Dwarf, and the Scorpion."&lt;ref name=waugh&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=fm8mRsBP3YkC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=%22coulton+waugh%22&amp;lr=&amp;num=30&amp;as_brr=0&amp;as_pt=ALLTYPES#PPP1,M1 Waugh, Coulton.

Following up on the success of the comic strip, reprints of the feature in [[comic book]] form appeared from various publishers. Merwil, a small publisher, offered reprints in 1937. In 1938 [[Dell Comics]] began reprinting the newspaper strips in ''Crackajack Funnies'' alongside other established newspaper features. When that title ceased publication in 1942, ''Don Winslow'' reprints begin running in ''Popular Comics'', again with other strip favorites of the era. In addition, Dell also had Don Winslow in two issues of their ''[[Four Color Comics]]'', a series which spotlighted a different character with nearly every issue. Dell's 1938 [[one-shot (comics)|one-shot]], ''Famous Feature Stories'', contained more ''Winslow''.&lt;ref name=don&gt;[http://www.toonopedia.com/dwinslow.htm ''Don Winslow of the Navy''] at [[Don Markstein's Toonopedia]].

[[Fawcett Comics]] released the ''Don Winslow of the Navy'' comic book with original stories beginning in 1943. The cover of the first issue shows [[Captain Marvel (DC Comics)|Captain Marvel]] introducing the character to the readers. This series lasted until 1948, then was revived in 1951, for a total to 69 issues.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.comics.org/covers.lasso?SeriesID=331  ''Don Winslow of the Navy'' (Fawcett Publications)] at the [[Grand Comics Database]].&lt;/ref&gt; Winslow was revived again for a final brief time starting in 1955 in reprints published by [[Charlton Comics]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.comics.org/covers.lasso?SeriesID=11437 Grand Comics Database: ''Don Winslow of the Navy'' (Charlton Comics)]{{dead link|date=December 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} at the Grand Comics Database.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1991, the gross primary enrollment rate was 56.9 percent.&lt;ref name=ilab/&gt;  In 2000, the net primary enrollment rate for children between the ages of 6 and 11 was 43 percent.&lt;ref name=ilab/&gt; Primary school attendance rates were unavailable for the Central African Republic as of 2001.&lt;ref name=ilab/&gt; While enrollment rates indicate a level of commitment to education, they do not always reflect children’s participation in school.&lt;ref name=ilab/&gt;

There is not equal access to primary school for girls. For the first year of school, 65% of girls are enrolled in primary school. This dropped to 23% of girls after six years of primary school in 2007. Many girls drop out of school in their early teens due to societal pressures to marry and have children.&lt;ref name="state"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.state.gov/documents/organization/220305.pdf|title=CENTRAL AFRICAN REPUBLIC 2013 HUMAN RIGHTS REPORT |access-date=November 14, 2016|website=U.S. Department of State}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Flemish Union of Students''' ({{lang-nl|Vlaamse Vereniging van Studenten}}; '''VVS''') is an organisation that represents the students of [[Flanders]], the Dutch-speaking part of [[Belgium]].

VVS can only represent the students in the [[Flemish community]] of [[Belgium]] due to the historically grown federalisation of the country. For the [[French Community of Belgium]] there is a separate student union (FEF). VVS is a member of the [[European Students' Union]].

'''Florence McClung''' (July 12, 1894 – 1992) was an American painter, printmaker, and art teacher. She was the daughter of Charles W. and Minerva (McCoy) White and was born at [[St. Louis]], [[Missouri]], on July 12, 1894. She moved to [[Dallas]] in 1899 and lived there until her death. She was related to the Dallas Nine, an influential group of Dallas-based artists.

After having studied for a career as a concert pianist, McClung studied pastel with [[Frank Reaugh]] in the early 1920s and then learnt from Olin Travis and [[Alexandre Hogue]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/fmcwu MCCLUNG, FLORENCE ELLIOTT WHITE | The Handbook of Texas Online| Texas State Historical Association (TSHA)&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;
She painted for periods of time in [[Taos, New Mexico|Taos]] between 1928 and 1932, thus joining a circle that included Hogue, [[Mabel Dodge Luhan]] and [[Tony Luhan]] and the [[Taos Society of Artists]].&lt;ref&gt;''Independent Spirits, Women Painters of the American West, 1890-1945'', Edited by Patricia Trenton, pp 189-191&lt;/ref&gt;

McClung became an active member of the Printmakers Guild (renamed Texas Printmakers in 1952) in the 1940s and 50s. This guild was a small group of Texas Women artists founded as a consequence of the exclusion of women from the Lone Star Printmakers of Dallas, headed by Hogue and Bywaters. In 1945, she was elected the Director of Texas Fine Arts Association, now known as the Texas Visual Arts Association. In 1946, she was elected to the board of directors of the [[Southern States Art League]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;''Florence McClung: A Southwestern Vision'', Kimberley Summer Haley, 1995, pp 56-57&lt;/ref&gt;

McClung's later works were mostly [[serigraph]]s. As she approached her early sixties in the mid-1950s she began to lose her sight and decreased her productivity. She eventually became blind in her right eye following an operation in 1986. Another possible explanation of her decrease in activity was that it became difficult for her to "reconcile her love for rural countryside with the growing urban character of Dallas".&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

Her art always remained deeply linked to the Texas identity: "Underlying the work and reflected in all its manifestations is a clearly defined purpose: to make a vivid, permanent record of those phases of southwestern life which even now are disappearing".&lt;ref&gt;Dallas Morning News, 1941/05/11, ''Solo Exhibit, Hobby Show To Be Viewed''&lt;/ref&gt; Before she died, McClung gave several of her paintings to the [[Dallas Museum of Art]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artcyclopedia.com/artists/mcclung_florence.html Florence McClung Online&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12714">'''Green Dot Bystander Intervention''' is a [[bystander education]] approach that aims to prevent violence with the help of bystanders. It is built on the premise that violence can be measurably and systematically reduced within a community.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Bystander intervention as a way of [[violence]] prevention programs are becoming popular within society.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; Its mission is to reduce [[Violence against women|power based-violence]] by being a proactive bystander and a reactive bystander.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;"Title IX." ''End Rape On Campus''. End Rape On Campus. Web. http://endrapeoncampus.org/title-ix/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;"The Green Dot Etc. Overview." ''Green Dot Etcetera''. Green Dot Etcetera Inc, 2010. Web. https://www.livethegreendot.com/&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The Green Dot Bystander Intervention Program was founded by Dr. Dorothy Edwards.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The program trains people about [[sexual assault]] and [[domestic violence]] on college campuses, primary and secondary schools, and communities. It develops and offers training for sexual assault and domestic violence.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; The method teaches students to intervene by using the 3 D's: Direct, Delegating the responsibility to others, and creating a Distraction to defuse a potentially dangerous situation.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; As described by Green Dot an example of this is in a situation at a party, intervening could mean that instead of calling out an inebriated student, an individual can create a distraction by "accidentally" spilling their drink on a potential aggressor.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

Dr. Dorothy Edwards is the founder of the Green Dot Bystander Intervention program. Prior to creating the program Dorothy Edwards worked as the [[University of Kentucky student life|University of Kentucky's]] Violence Intervention and Prevention Director where she discovered that individuals were not sure how to respond when witnessing a potential [[sexual assault]].&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; In her first year of running the program she trained 10 individuals, but by the time she left the [[University of Kentucky]] she was training 3,500 students and volunteers.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; The initiative led by Dr. Edwards was supported by a new focus on [[White House Task Force to Protect Students from Sexual Assault|bystanders in The White House]]. Green Dot, Bringing in the Bystander, and [[Futures Without Violence|Coaching Boys Into Men]] are preventative bystander programs that have begun to make cultural changes.

=== Title IX ===
[[Title IX]] of the [[Education Amendments of 1972|1972 Education Amendment]] is a tool meant to combat campus violence. The law requires colleges and universities to fight [[gender-based violence]], [[harassment]], and respond to the needs of survivors promoting equal educational access.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;"Title IX in Detail." ''Know Your IX: Empowering Students to Stop Sexual Violence.'' http://knowyourix.org/title-ix/title-ix-in-detail/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;"Sexual Harassment &amp; Assault." ''National Women's Law Center''. National Women's Law Center, 2015. Web. http://www.nwlc.org/our-issues/education-%2526-title-ix/sexual-harassment-%2526-assault&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Sexual assault in education ===
[[Sexual violence]] in schools and on campuses is a pressing civil rights issue.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; According to the National Women's Law Center students who suffer from [[sexual assault]] and [[harassment]] are deprived the liberty of equal education.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; A majority of sexual assaults involving college students also involve drugs and alcohol.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;  A female or male who is incapacitated due to drugs and alcohol is legally incapable of giving consent and someone who has sex with an incapacitated person can be prosecuted for [[rape]].&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

== Purpose ==
The goal of Green Dot is to implement a [[bystander intervention]] strategy that prevents and reduces power-based personal violence.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;Cherkis, Jason, and Ryan Grim. "Here's How You Can Help Stop A Sexual Assault Before It Happens." ''The Huffington Post'' 9 July 2015, Politics sec.

The curriculum is created from the concepts and lessons learned through research and theory across disciplines including: [[violence against women]], diffusion of innovation, [[public health]], [[Social networking service|social networking]], [[psychology]], [[Bystander effect|bystander dynamics]], perpetration, and marketing/advertising.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"The Green Dot Etc. Philosophy." ''Green Dot Etcetera''. Green Dot Etcetera Inc, 2010. Web. https://www.livethegreendot.com/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

A Green Dot is a behavior, choice, or action that promotes safety for everyone. It communicates intolerance for [[sexual violence]], [[Dating abuse|dating violence]], and [[stalking]].&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;"UCI Green Dot." ''University of California''. University of California, 4 Nov. 2015. Web. http://www.studentaffairs.uci.edu/greendot/whatisagreendot.php&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;Coker, A. L., P. G. Cook-Craig, C. M. Williams, B. S.

''Violence Against Women'' 17.6 (2011): 777-96. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; The goal is to promote safety on college campuses.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Training  ==
Green Dot develops programs, strategies, curriculum, and training courses designed to address power-based personal violence across environments.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; Training strategies include: strategic planning, bystander mobilization, communication, and [[Coalition|coalition building]].&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;"Green Dot Faculty &amp; Staff Toolkit." ''University of Portland''. Office on Violence Against Women. Web. http://www.up.edu/showimage/show.aspx?file=21219&lt;/ref&gt; The program provides training courses for leadership and professionals that focus on the core areas necessary for successful implementation of the program.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;Smith, Carol. "A Dangerous Mix: Drinking, Sex, and College Students." ''InvestigateWest''. InvestigateWest, 2010. Web. http://invw.org/2010/02/25/940/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;"The Green Dot Etc. Training." ''Green Dot Etcetera''. Green Dot Etcetera Inc, 2010. Web. https://www.livethegreendot.com/&lt;/ref&gt;

The Green Dot bystander program uses four training modules to educate bystanders on their impact. 
# The first module provides bystanders with an overview of the strategy, where key definitions and strategies are discussed.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;"An Overview of the Green Dot Strategy." ''California Coalition Against Sexual Assault (CALCASA)''. California Coalition Against Sexual Assault. Web. http://www.calcasa.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/Curriculum-Summary.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; 
# The second module  reviews the observable behaviors associated with the major forms of power-based violence and educates about how to recognize potential dangerous or harmful situations.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; 
# Module three educates bystanders on obstacles within themselves that stop them from intervening. 
#* There are three major categories of influence it uses:&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; 
#** The categories are personal, relationship, and general issues, which impact the way in which individuals intervene.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Personal characteristics may include being shy, fearful, or uncertain and not wanting to risk embarrassment.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Relationship characteristics involve not wanting to upset friends or a party policer.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; General issues include the belief that someone else will intervene, the risk of embarrassment, or creating a scene.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;
# Module four focuses on building skills and generating confidence in the performance of the program. 
#* There are two types of Green Dots: proactive and reactive. The goal of proactive Green Dots is to set the two norms that are communicated: violence will not be tolerated and everyone is expected to do his or her part to contribute to fostering a safe community. Reactive Green Dots are done in reaction to seeing concerning behavior or potential dangers, either to stop them from happening or decrease the likelihood they will get worse.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;

The heart of the Green Dot Bystander Intervention program are the 3 D's: direct,&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; distract,&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; and delegate.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; Direct interaction with the potential perpetrator or victim can be used to address concern.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; Through Distraction a [[wikt:bystander|bystander]] can create a diversion to diffuse the potentially problematic  situation.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; Lastly, through delegation a bystander can ask for someone else to help intervene in the situation.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; The 3 D's work in situations of high risk to act as reactive Green Dots.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

Examples of proactive Green Dots are creating social media campaigns, checking-in with friends, promoting awareness, and hosting green dot sports games.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;

Examples of reactive Green Dots include: ''directly'' confronting a situation, ''distracting'' by changing the conversation and the energy of the interaction or by distracting the individuals, or ''delegating'' by finding someone who will be more successful in fixing the problem (bar tender, other friends, police offer, etc.)&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;

=== Case studies ===

Ann Coker at the [[University of Kentucky|University of Kentucky's Center for Research on Violence Against Women]] (CRVAW) led a study pertaining to the effectiveness at Green Dots' reduction of sexual violence. In the study, CRVAW found a greater than 50% reduction in the self-reported frequency of [[Sexual violence|sexual violence perpetration]] by students at schools that received Green Dot training.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;Hautala, Keith. "'Green Dot' Effective at Reducing Sexual Violence." ''University of Kentucky News: UKNOW''. College of Arts and Sciences, 10 Sept. 2014. Web. http://uknow.uky.edu/content/green-dot-effective-reducing-sexual-violence&lt;/ref&gt; The CRVAW study also found a 40% reduction in self-reported frequency of total violence perpetration including [[sexual violence]], [[sexual harassment]], [[stalking]], and [[dating violence]].&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;  Ann Coker, and the CRVAW team identify violence prevention as a public health priority.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

A recent study of 2,504 college undergraduate students between 18 and 24 looked at the impact of bystander intervention on college campuses. The study found that 46% of the students surveyed had heard a Green Dot speech on their college campus. Out of the sample size surveyed, only 14% had received active bystander training in the past two years. Students trained in Green Dot bystander intervention reported engaging in significantly more bystander behaviors and observing more self-reported active bystander behaviors compared to non-trained students. Those receiving bystander intervention training appeared to report more active bystander behaviors than those simply hearing a Green Dot speech, and both intervention groups reported more observed and active bystander behaviors than non-exposed students.&lt;ref&gt;Coker, A. L., P. G. Cook-Craig, C. M. Williams, B. S. Fisher, E. R. Clear, L. S. Garcia, and L. M. Hegge. "Evaluation of Green Dot: An Active Bystander Intervention to Reduce Sexual Violence on College Campuses." ''Violence Against Women'' 17.6 (2011): 777-96.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Portrait de Guillaume Couture.jpg|thumb|Couture pictured before 1915]]
'''Guillaume Couture''' (23 October 1851 &amp;ndash; 15 January 1915) was a Canadian [[choir]] [[conducting|conductor]], [[composer]], [[music critic]], and [[music educator]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thecanadianencyclopedia.com/index.cfm?PgNm=TCE&amp;Params=U1ARTU0000821|title=Couture, Guillaume - The Canadian Encyclopedia|publisher=[[The Canadian Encyclopedia]]|accessdate=22 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although he never pursued a performance career, he is particularly remembered for his work as a voice teacher, having taught many notable Canadian singers. He is the grandfather of composer [[Jean Papineau-Couture]].

==Life and career==
Born in [[Montreal]], Couture was choirmaster at [[Saint-Jacques Cathedral (Montreal)|Saint-Jacques Cathedral]] before studying at the [[Conservatoire de Paris]] with [[Romain Bussine]] and [[Théodore Dubois]] from 1873 to 1875. His ''Rêverie'', opus 2 (notably the only Canadian orchestral work published before 1900){{citation needed|date=September 2012}} was premiered in Paris in 1875 in a concert that also included original works by [[Henri Duparc (composer)|Henri Duparc]], [[Gabriel Fauré]], and [[César Franck]]. That same year he returned to his native city where he began teaching privately and writing as a music critic for ''[[La Minerve]]''. He continued to return periodically to France for further studies with Bussine through 1887.

In early 1876 Couture returned to Paris to assume the post of choirmaster at the [[Basilica of St. Clotilde, Paris]]. César Franck was notably the organist at the cathedral at that time. He left there in late 1877 for Montreal where he took up teaching again, both privately and for religious institutions like the [[Congregation of Notre Dame]] and the Institute of the Sisters of the Holy Names of Jesus and Mary. He taught at the [[High School of Montreal|High School for Girls, Montreal]], from 1885 to 1914.&lt;ref&gt;Pierre Quenneville, [http://www.biographi.ca/en/bio/couture_guillaume_1851_1915_14F.html COUTURE (Coutu), GUILLAUME (William)] in Dictionary of Canadian Biography, vol. 14 (University of Toronto/Université Laval, 2003– ) online, accessed January 5, 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

Among his notable students were [[Joseph-Arsène Brassard]], [[Jean-Noël Charbonneau]], [[Guillaume Dupuis]], [[Achille Fortier]], [[Henri Gagnon]], [[Charles Labelle]], [[Arthur Laurendeau]], [[Édouard LeBel]], [[Frédéric Pelletier]], [[Arthur Plamondon]], [[Céline Marier]], [[Léo-Pol Morin]], [[Rodolphe Plamondon]], [[Caroline Racicot]], [[Roy Royal]], and [[Louis Verschelden]].

Couture continued to work as a music critic, writing for such papers as ''Revue de Montréal'', ''[[La Patrie (Canadian newspaper)|La Patrie]]'', and ''[[Montreal Star]]''. In 1880 he became conductor of the [[Montreal Philharmonic Society]] which he led until it disbanded in 1899. In 1894 he founded the Montréal Symphony Orchestra (no relation to the current orchestra), which he directed through 1896. He composed his most significant work, the [[oratorio]] ''[[Jean le Précurseur]]'', from 1907 to 1909. He died in Montreal in 1915 at the age of 63.

A '''Key Stage''' is a stage of the [[state school|state]] [[education]] system in [[England]], [[Wales]], [[Northern Ireland]] and the British Territory of [[Gibraltar]] setting the educational knowledge expected of students at various ages. The term is also used in some other at
autonomous territories such as [[Hong Kong]] and countries such as [[Australia]] (some states) although the ages at which each Key Stage applies differ from England.

==Stages==
The stages are as follows:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/schools/parents/national_curriculum_key_stages/ BBC Learning Article: "The National Curriculum and Key Stages in England"]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[National Curriculum (England, Wales and Northern Ireland)|National Curriculum]] sets out targets to be achieved in various subject areas at each of the Key Stages.

The Key Stages were first defined in the [[Education Reform Act 1988|1988 Education Reform Act]] to accompany the first introduction of the National Curriculum. The precise definition of each of the main 4 Key Stages is age-related, incorporating all pupils of a particular age at the beginning of each academic year. The Key Stages were designed to fit with the most prevalent structures which had already grown up in the education system over the previous 100 years of development.

Prior to the four main key stages, pupils attend a [[Foundation Stage]], the latter part of which is compulsory.

Key Stage 1 fits broadly with the first stage of [[primary education]], often known as [[infant school]]s. This break had existed for some time, being acknowledged in the 1931 [[Hadow Report]] as 'axiomatic' by as early as 1870.[https://web.archive.org/web/20120305104919/http://www.educationengland.org.uk/documents/hadow1931/3104.html]

Key Stage 2 fits the later stage of primary education, often known as [[junior school]]s. Again, described by Sir [[William Henry Hadow]], this took pupils up to the standardised break at age 11.

Secondary education was split between [[Key Stage 3]] &amp; [[Key Stage 4]] at age 14, to align with long-existing two-year examination courses at [[GCSE]] level.

Key Stages 0 and 5 have no legal definition, and are merely used as indicators to complement the defined Key Stages.

{{Use dmy dates|date=April 2015}}'''Laura Harding''' is an architectural practitioner and critic based in Sydney. Harding works across architecture and [[urban design]], with a particular focus on the public realm. She is also an architectural critic and an active participant in the public culture of architecture. Harding regularly contributes to architectural education as a visiting critic at the [[University of New South Wales]] and the [[University of Sydney]]. From 2006 to 2012 she taught with [[Glenn Murcutt]] in the third year design program at the University of New South Wales.

==Biography==

Harding was born in Sydney in 1975. She studied architecture at the [[University of Sydney]], graduating with a Bachelor of Science (Architecture) in 1995 and a Bachelor of Architecture in 1998. She has worked at the Sydney-based practice Hill Thalis Architecture + Urban Projects for eighteen years, having joined the practice in 1996 as a student.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.hillthalis.com.au/index.php?id=35|title = Hill Thalis|date = |accessdate = |website = Hill Thalis Architecture and Urban Projects|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==

Harding began writing architectural criticism in 2004, first for ''[[Architecture Australia]]'', the journal of record of Australian architecture, and subsequently for a range of professional publications and mainstream media outlets. She was appointed a contributing editor to ''Architecture Australia'' in 2005, a position she continues to hold.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://architectureau.com/contributors/Harding-Laura/|title = Laura Harding|date = |accessdate = 8 March 2015|website = ArchitectureAU|publisher = Architecture Media|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Harding has had criticism published in [[The Guardian]] and is a regular contributor to [[The Saturday Paper]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.thesaturdaypaper.com.au/contributor/laura-harding#.VPu7qGTLdZE|title = Contributor's page, The Saturday Paper|date = |accessdate = |website = The Saturday Paper|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.theguardian.com/profile/laura-harding|title = Contributor's page, The Guardian|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Harding was guest editor, alongside Philip Thalis, of a special issue of ''[[Architecture Australia]]'' on Urban Housing (''Architecture Australia'' (May 2014).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://architectureau.com/tags/2014-aa-urban-housing-dossier/|title = Urban Housing Dossier|last = Laura Harding|first = Philip Thalis|date = May 2014|journal = Architecture Australia|doi = |pmid = |access-date = 8 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Architectural work==

Harding's project work crosses architecture and urban design, with a particular focus on multi-residential and urban projects. Her work includes the award-winning project Substation No. 175, which converted a remnant substation building in Surry Hills into a 'tiny urban tower'. This intensified the use of the tiny site and aimed to show that "no lot need be too small to be used effectively".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://naomistead.com/?p=201|title = Substation No 175, Surry Hills|last = Stead|first = Naomi|date = June 2005|journal = Architectural Review Australia|doi = |pmid = |access-date = 8 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Harding was project urban designer on the winning entry in the international design competition for East Darling Harbour ([[Barangaroo, New South Wales|Barangaroo]]) by Hill Thalis Architecture + Urban Projects, Paul Berkemeier Architects and Jane Irwin Landscape Architecture.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://architectureau.com/articles/competition-9/|title = East Darling Harbour|last = Mossop|first = Elizabeth|date = July 2006|journal = Architecture Australia|doi = |pmid = |access-date = 8 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This proposed a new urban street pattern, waterfront park and urban grain for the Millers Point wharves. The scheme did not go ahead.

This list is limited to programs which teach four or more languages. There are many others which teach one language.

'''Alphabetical Lists of Languages''' show the courses available to learn each language, at Lang1234, Martindale, Omniglot, Rüdiger Köppe, and UCLA. For the thousands of languages not listed on those sites, for which no course exists, [[Global Recordings Network]] has recorded a standard set of Bible stories in 6,000 languages. With effort, learners can study any language by comparing its recordings to the same story in a language they know.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Geographic Language Museum|url=http://foreignlanguageexpertise.com/museum2.html|publisher=[[Alexander Argüelles]] |accessdate=2018-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The list below''' shows the number of languages taught by each program, the name of the program, and the number of different languages used for instruction. Multiple languages of instruction may be available for some but not all courses. For example [[Reise Know-How]] uses 6 languages to teach German, but only German to teach the other languages. On the other hand [[Eurotalk]], [[Pronunciator]] and [[50Languages]] use all languages to teach all the other languages.

On May November 2013, the Queen Rania Foundation for [[Education]] and Development (QRF)&lt;ref&gt;http://www.qrf.org&lt;/ref&gt; of [[Jordan (country)|Jordan]], established by [[Queen Rania of Jordan|Queen Rania al Abdallah of Jordan]], launched a [[non-profit]] [[massive open online course]] ([[MOOC]]) [[Enterprise portal|portal]], Edraak, for the promotion of [[knowledge]] in the [[Arab world]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.edraak.org&lt;/ref&gt; Edraak uses the open-source [[EdX|edX platform by edX]], which also used by two global MOOC providers: [https://web.archive.org/web/20150402163539/http://www.consciousevolution.me/tag/xuetang/ XuetangX] in [[China]] and the [[France|French]] Université Numérique.

QRF contracted several regional and international scholars from prestigious universities to design and deliver the courses.  Courses typically ran between 3 – 8 weeks. Among the pioneers that joined forces with QRF was the American University of Beirut that contributed two courses.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.aub.edu.lb/news/2014/Pages/moocs-online-learning-digital-degrees.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Courses from QRF are offered primarily in [[Arabic language|Arabic]], but [[translations]] of courses from prestigious [[university|universities]] like [[Harvard]] and [[MIT]] are also available. At its launching, Edraak offered 10 courses.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.class-central.com/report/queen-raina-jordan-edraak-mooc-edx&lt;/ref&gt;

* Intro to [[Computer Science]] &amp; [[Computer Programming|Programming]]
* [[Electricity]] &amp; [[Electrical Circuit|Circuit]]s
* Journey in the [[Film Industry]]
* Children’s [[Mental Health]]
* Effective Strategies for Job Search
* Shopping Yourself in the Job Market
* A Successful CV
* Confidence Awareness
* [[Citizenship]] in the Arab World
* Arabs: Where from and Where to?
* Business Communication
* Innovation in the Government
* Basic Skills for First Aid

Edraak is also seen as an employee training and recruitment platform for companies in the region.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.universityworldnews.com/article.php?story=20140529184801359|title=New Arab platform for MOOCs launched - University World News|website=www.universityworldnews.com|access-date=2017-02-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; The varied nature of the online courses provides companies the opportunity to upgrade employee skills as workplace demands continuously increases. Through removing the language barriers and making knowledge accessible, Edraak may contribute to decreasing Arab's lagging behind the western world in education in knowledge and digital fluency.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.universityworldnews.com/article.php?story=20140529184801359&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Marisa Rezende''' (born 1944) is a [[Brazil]]ian music educator and composer.

== Personal life ==
Marisa Rezende was born in [[Rio de Janeiro]], the daughter of a doctor (Nunes de Barcellos) and his wife (Costa Pereira) of [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] ancestry. She began playing piano at four without instruction and began lessons at age five. She studied piano at Escola de Musica in Rio, but her studies were interrupted by marriage. The couple moved in 1964 to [[Boston, Massachusetts]], where her husband worked on a master's degree at [[MIT]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8GZLAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA270&amp;dq=Marisa+Rezende&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=fNTcTPjxLIL48Abby4jyCQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=9&amp;ved=0CEcQ6AEwCA|title=The new Grove dictionary of music and musicians, Volume 4|author=Tyrrell, John|publisher=Grove|year=2001|accessdate=12 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rezende had two daughters in Boston, and when the family moved back to Rio in 1967, she had a third daughter before resuming her studies in composition. The family moved to [[Recife]], where she worked as a pianist with the orchestra and finished her undergraduate degree. She studied fugue and counterpoint with [[Morelenbaum]] and [[Virginia Fiuza]] and composition with [[Padre Jaime Diniz]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=|title=Chronology of Western Classical Music: 1751-1900|author=Hall, Charles J.|year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Martina Arroyo''' (born February 2, 1936)&lt;ref&gt;Some sources give 1937.&lt;/ref&gt; is an American [[opera]]tic [[soprano]] who had a major international opera career from the 1960s through the 1980s. She was part of the first generation of black opera singers of Puerto Rican descent to achieve wide success, and is viewed as part of an instrumental group of performers who helped break down the barriers of racial prejudice in the opera world.

Arroyo first rose to prominence at the [[Zurich Opera]] between 1963–1965, and then was one of the [[Metropolitan Opera]]'s leading sopranos between 1965 and 1978. During her 13 years at the Metropolitan Opera, she was also a regular presence at the world's  [[opera house]]s, performing on the stages of [[La Scala]], [[Royal Opera, London|Covent Garden]], the [[Opéra National de Paris]], the [[Teatro Colón]], the [[Deutsche Oper Berlin]], the [[Vienna State Opera]], the [[Lyric Opera of Chicago]], and the [[San Francisco Opera]]. She is best known for her performances of the Italian [[spinto]] repertoire, and in particular, her portrayals of Verdi and Puccini heroines. Her last opera performance was in 1991, after which she has devoted her time to teaching singing on the faculties of various universities in the United States and Europe.&lt;ref name="JL"&gt;Johnston, Laurie.

Accessed May 11, 2010.{{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt; On December 8, 2013, Arroyo received a [[Kennedy Center Honors|Kennedy Center Honor]].&lt;ref name="KCH"&gt;[http://www.kennedy-center.org/programs/specialevents/honors/history.cfm Kennedy-Center.org website] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081209052332/http://www.kennedy-center.org/programs/specialevents/honors/history.cfm |date=2008-12-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early years==
Arroyo was born in New York City, the younger of two children of Demetrio Arroyo, originally from [[Puerto Rico]], and Lucille Washington, a native of [[Charleston, South Carolina]]. Her older brother grew up to become a [[Baptist]] [[Minister (Christianity)|minister]]. The family lived in [[Harlem]] near [[St. Nicholas Avenue]] and [[111th Street (Manhattan)|111th Street]]. Her father was a mechanical engineer at the [[Brooklyn Navy Yard]] and earned a good salary which enabled Arroyo's mother to stay at home with their children. His job also allowed the family to experience New York's cultural offerings and the family frequented [[museum]]s, [[concert]]s, and the theatre. It was attending several performances of [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] shows during the 1940s that first inspired Arroyo's interest in becoming a performer. Her mother humored her dreams and allowed Arroyo to take [[ballet]] classes. Her mother was also a talented amateur classical pianist and taught her daughter to play the instrument. Arroyo's other musical experiences as a child were largely through singing in the choirs at her Baptist church and as a student at [[Hunter College High School]].&lt;ref name="NYT"&gt;[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9901E5DD153AF936A35755C0A9679D8B63 "Paid Notice: Deaths – Maurel, Michel], ''[[The New York Times]]'', June 5, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="KCH"/&gt;&lt;ref name="JL"/&gt;
==Hunter College==
After finishing high school in 1953, Arroyo attended [[Hunter College]] where she earned a B.A. in [[Romance languages]] in 1956 at the age of nineteen. While there she studied voice as a hobby in an opera workshop with Joseph Turnau. Turnau recognized that Arroyo was a major talent who just needed proper training. After the workshop ended, he introduced her to voice instructor [[Marinka Gurewich]], who immediately accepted her  as a student. When Arroyo did not take her training as seriously as her teacher wanted, Gurewich eventually threatened to end their lessons. Arroyo said of the incident, {{Quotebox|"It was a real wake-up call. Up to then, I must have been, in my mind, treating singing as a hobby, a lark—something I loved that I was dabbling in."}} She further explained that at that point most of the major opera houses, including the [[Metropolitan Opera]], had never cast a black singer, so in her mind "opera wasn't a real possibility." Gurewich's threat, however, forced her to take her studies more seriously and she continued to study with her until Gurewich's death in 1990. Another important partnership formed around this time was with concert manager Thea Dispeker who, after attending one of Arroyo's recitals, offered her services at no charge until Arroyo's career took off. Dispeker helped manage much of Arroyo's career over the next several decades.&lt;ref name="KCH"/&gt;&lt;ref name="JL"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT"/&gt;
==Career as a social worker==
After graduating from college, Arroyo was faced with the difficulty of working while trying to study singing. On the advice of her mother, she became an English teacher at Bronx High School in the Fall of 1956 but found it difficult to balance her teaching responsibilities with continued training under Gurewich. She decided to leave her teaching position and take work as a [[social worker]] at the East End Welfare Center. For two years, she managed a case load of over 100 welfare recipients while continuing her voice training. Arroyo found the work fulfilling and stated of the experience, "My life had been centered on music for so long, and suddenly there I was, deeply involved in other people's problems,".&lt;ref name="KCH"/&gt;&lt;ref name="JL"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT"/&gt;
==Metropolitan Opera==
In 1957 Arroyo auditioned for the Metropolitan Opera but was not accepted. Somewhat disheartened, she flirted with the idea of becoming an academic and began working on a master's degree in comparative literature at [[New York University]] with a dissertation on Ignacio Silone's ''Pane e Vino and Vino e Pane''. The following year she competed in and won the Metropolitan Opera's ''Audition of the Air'' competition (precursor to its National Council Auditions), earning a $1,000 cash prize and a scholarship to the Met's Kathryn Long School. She left NYU and entered the Kathryn Long School in the Fall of 1957 where she studied singing, drama, German, English diction, and fencing. While at the school, she was offered the role of the first [[Coryphaeus|coryphée]] in the American premiere of [[Ildebrando Pizzetti]]'s ''[[Assassinio nella cattedrale|Murder in the Cathedral]]'' to be performed at a festival in upstate New York. The concert, however, was rained out and was rescheduled for a performance at [[Carnegie Hall]] instead on September 17, 1958. This marked Arroyo's first professional appearance singing in an opera. ''[[The New York Times]]'' said of her performance, "Martina Arroyo is a gifted soprano who appears to have remarkable potential, and she sang with a voice of amplitude and lovely color."&lt;ref name="KCH"/&gt;&lt;ref name="JL"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT"/&gt;

In February 1959 Arroyo sang the title role in [[Gluck]]'s ''[[Iphigénie en Tauride]]'' in a concert version with the [[Little Orchestra Society]] at [[The Town Hall|Town Hall]]. Shortly thereafter she made her debut on the opera stage at the Metropolitan Opera as the Celestial Voice in [[Giuseppe Verdi]]'s ''[[Don Carlo]]'' on March 14, 1959 with [[Eugenio Fernandi]] in the title role, [[Leonie Rysanek]] as Elizabeth, [[Robert Merrill]] as Rodrigo, and [[Nell Rankin]] as Princess Eboli. This was the beginning of a long association with the Met and the beginning of a lengthy career on the opera stage.&lt;ref name="KCH"/&gt;&lt;ref name="JL"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT"/&gt;
 
==Musical career==
After having made her Met debut, Arroyo moved to Europe where she began to appear in roles with minor [[opera house]]s in 1959. While performing in Italy of that year she met her future husband, professional violist [[Emilio Poggioni]]. The marriage ended in divorce and she later was married to Michel Maurel until his death in 2011.&lt;ref name="TNYT"&gt;[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9901E5DD153AF936A35755C0A9679D8B63 "Paid Notice: Deaths – Maurel, Michel], ''[[The New York Times]]'', June 5, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Over the next several years Arroyo worked mostly in Europe in mostly smaller roles, failing to land the larger name-making roles. Those larger parts which she did get were mostly in more obscure works. During 1961 and 1962 she went back and forth between Europe and the Metropolitan Opera frequently, with her roles at the Met during this period being in [[Richard Wagner]]'s ''[[The Ring Cycle]]'' and in reprises of ''Don Carlo''. Her roles in the ''Ring'' included the Third Norn and Woglinde in ''[[Götterdämmerung]]'', Woglinde in ''[[Das Rheingold]]'', Ortlinde in ''[[Die Walküre]]'', and the Forest Bird in ''[[Siegfried (opera)|Siegfried]]''.&lt;ref name="KCH"/&gt;&lt;ref name="JL"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT"/&gt;&lt;ref name="TNYT"/&gt;

In 1963 Arroyo's first major break came when she was offered a contract to join the [[Zurich Opera]] as a principal soprano. She made her debut there in the title role of Verdi's ''[[Aida]]'' where she was received enthusiastically. She continued to sing regularly at that opera house through 1968.&lt;ref name="KCH"/&gt;&lt;ref name="JL"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT"/&gt;&lt;ref name="TNYT"/&gt;

Aida became an important role for Arroyo early in her career, serving as a calling card for her at many major opera houses during the 1960s. She sang the role for her first appearance at the [[Hamburg State Opera]] in 1963 and at both the [[Deutsche Oper Berlin]] and the [[Vienna State Opera]] in 1964. In February of the following year she sang Aida in her first starring role at the Met as a last minute replacement for [[Birgit Nilsson]]. The performance received rave reviews with ''The New York Times'' praising Arroyo as "one of the most gorgeous voices before the public today." [[Rudolf Bing]], the Met's director, immediately offered her a contract to join the roster of the company's principal sopranos which extended for several years.&lt;ref name="KCH"/&gt;&lt;ref name="JL"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT"/&gt;&lt;ref name="TNYT"/&gt;

Arroyo began the 1965/66 season at the Met in October with a critically acclaimed performance of Elizabeth in ''Don Carlo''. She immediately became a favorite singer at that house portraying mostly Verdi heroines and the Met became her principal home from that point up until 1978. Her other roles at the Met during these thirteen years included Aida, Amelia in Verdi's ''[[Un ballo in maschera]]'', Cio-Cio-San in [[Giacomo Puccini]]'s ''[[Madama Butterfly]]'', Donna Anna in [[Mozart]]'s ''[[Don Giovanni]]'', Elvira in Verdi's ''[[Ernani]]'', Lady Macbeth in Verdi's ''[[Macbeth (opera)|Macbeth]]'', Leonora in Verdi's ''[[Il trovatore]]'', Leonora in Verdi's ''[[La forza del destino]]'', Liù in Puccini's ''[[Turandot]]'', Maddalena in [[Umberto Giordano]]'s ''[[Andrea Chénier]]'', Santuzza in [[Pietro Mascagni]]'s ''[[Cavalleria rusticana]]'', and the title role in [[Amilcare Ponchielli]]'s ''[[La Gioconda (opera)|La Gioconda]]'' among others. She was also notably the first black person to portray the role of Elsa in Wagner's ''[[Lohengrin (opera)|Lohengrin]]'' in 1968, not just at the Met, but in all of opera history.&lt;ref name="KCH"/&gt;&lt;ref name="JL"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT"/&gt;&lt;ref name="TNYT"/&gt;
==International Opera Houses==
During her years at the Met, Arroyo would frequently travel to perform at other houses both in the United States and internationally. In 1968 she sang for the first time in [[Israel]] and made her first appearance in the United Kingdom as Valentine in a London concert performance of [[Meyerbeer]]'s ''[[Les Huguenots]]''. Later that year she made her debut at the [[Royal Opera, London|Royal Opera]] at [[Covent Garden]] and the [[Philadelphia Lyric Opera Company]], both singing the role of Aida. She returned to both companies a number of times during the 1970s as Verdi heroines and in parts like the title roles in Puccini's ''[[Tosca]]'' and [[Richard Strauss]]'s ''[[Ariadne auf Naxos]]''. She sang Amelia in ''Un ballo in maschera'' for her debuts with both the [[San Francisco Opera]] (1971) and the [[Lyric Opera of Chicago]] (1972). She returned to Chicago to sing her first Amelia Grimaldi in Verdi's ''[[Simon Boccanegra]]'' in 1974. In 1972 she sang Aida for her debut at [[La Scala]] opposite [[Plácido Domingo]] as Radames. In 1973 she made her first appearances at the [[Opéra National de Paris]] and the [[Teatro Colón]] in Buenos Aires. In 1977 she made her debut with the [[Opera Company of Philadelphia]] portraying Senta in Wagner's ''[[The Flying Dutchman (opera)|The Flying Dutchman]]'' and in 1979 made her debut with [[Michigan Opera Theatre]] as Lenora in ''[[Il trovatore]]''. She remained very busy in the world's major opera houses through 1979 singing mostly Verdi, Puccini, and Strauss heroines and other roles from the lirico-spinto repertoire. Arroyo portrayed herself in an episode of ''[[The Odd Couple (1970 TV series)|The Odd Couple]]'' titled "Your Mother Wears Army Boots", which originally aired on January 16, 1975. The episode also featured [[Howard Cosell]] who is portrayed to be a big fan of hers.&lt;ref name="KCH"/&gt;&lt;ref name="JL"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT"/&gt;&lt;ref name="TNYT"/&gt;
==Retirement== 
By 1980, Arroyo's career had started to slow down and she was much more selective in what roles she chose to take. She returned to the Met in 1986 to sing Aida and Santuzza; making her last appearance and 199th performance at that house on October 31, 1986. In 1987 she sang her last portrayal of the title role in ''[[Turandot]]'' with the [[Seattle Opera]] and in 1989 she announced her retirement from the opera stage. She came out of retirement in 1991 for one last performance in the world premiere of [[Leslie Adams (composer)|Leslie Adams]]'s ''[[Blake (opera)|Blake]]'', an opera whose story is set in pre-Civil War America when slavery was still a reality.&lt;ref name="KCH"/&gt;&lt;ref name="JL"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT"/&gt;&lt;ref name="TNYT"/&gt;

Throughout her career Arroyo was also a frequent performer of the concert repertoire and appeared with many of the world's leading symphony orchestras. She performed often with the [[New York Philharmonic]] under conductor [[Leonard Bernstein]] who particularly admired her voice in such repertoire as Beethoven's ''[[Symphony No. 9 (Beethoven)|Symphony No. 9]]'' and ''[[Missa Solemnis (Beethoven)|Missa Solemnis]]''.

Arroyo's talents also extended beyond the concert stage into the realm of live network television. In 1964 she appeared with the [[CBS Symphony Orchestra]] under the conductor [[Alfredo Antonini]] in the episode "Feliz Borinquen" of the ''[[CBS Workshop|CBS Repertoire Workshop]]'' as herself.&lt;ref name="KCH"/&gt;&lt;ref name="JL"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT"/&gt;&lt;ref name="TNYT"/&gt;

Martina Arroyo is a recipient of a 2010 Opera Honors Award from the National Endowment for the Arts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.arts.gov/honors/opera/media/2010-opera-honorees.html |title=NEA Chairman Rocco Landesman Announces Recipients of the 2010 NEA Opera Honors |publisher=Arts.gov |date=2010-06-24 |accessdate=2010-07-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101207034150/http://www.arts.gov/honors/opera/media/2010-opera-honorees.html |archivedate=2010-12-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="KCH"/&gt;&lt;ref name="JL"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT"/&gt;&lt;ref name="TNYT"/&gt;

==Recordings==
Having performed in the major opera houses and with the greatest symphony orchestras of the world, she has left a legacy of recordings, including: [[George Frideric Handel|Handel]]'s ''[[Judas Maccabeus]]'' (twice) and ''[[Samson]]'', [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]]'s ''[[Don Giovanni]]'' (Donna Elvira for [[Karl Böhm]] and Donna Anna for [[Sir Colin Davis]]), [[Beethoven]]'s ''[[Missa Solemnis (Beethoven)|Missa solemnis]]'' and ''[[Symphony No. 9 (Beethoven)|Ninth Symphony]]'', [[Gioacchino Rossini|Rossini]]'s ''[[Stabat mater]]'', [[Giuseppe Verdi|Verdi]]'s ''[[I vespri siciliani]]'', ''[[Un ballo in maschera]]'', ''[[La forza del destino]]'' (in both the St. Peterburg and revised versions), and the ''[[Requiem (Verdi)|Messa da requiem]]'' and [[Gustav Mahler|Mahler]]'s massive Eighth Symphony the [[Symphony of a Thousand]].&lt;ref name="KCH"/&gt;&lt;ref name="JL"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT"/&gt;&lt;ref name="TNYT"/&gt;

She has recorded important [[20th-century music]], including [[Arnold Schoenberg|Schoenberg]]'s ''[[Gurre-Lieder]]'' and the ''African Oratorio'' by {{ill|Carlo Franci|it}}. She sang in the world premieres of two works: [[Karlheinz Stockhausen]]'s ''[[Momente]]'' and [[Samuel Barber]]'s ''Andromache's Farewell''.&lt;ref name="KCH"/&gt;&lt;ref name="JL"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT"/&gt;&lt;ref name="TNYT"/&gt;

Arroyo's discography (which also includes an aria recital), though enviable, does not encompass anything like the full range of roles she played on stage. At the [[Metropolitan Opera]] alone, these are the operas she performed but never recorded commercially: Verdi's ''[[Ernani]]'', ''[[Macbeth (opera)|Macbeth]]'', ''[[Il trovatore]]'', ''[[Don Carlos]]'' (the Celestial Voice as well as Elizabeth, both in Italian), and ''; [[Richard Wagner|Wagner]]'s ''[[Lohengrin (opera)|Lohengrin]]'' and ''[[Der Ring des Nibelungen]]'' (featured roles in all four operas); [[Amilcare Ponchielli|Ponchielli]]'s ''[[La Gioconda (opera)|La Gioconda]]''; [[Umberto Giordano|Giordano]]'s ''[[Andrea Chénier]]''; and [[Giacomo Puccini|Puccini]]'s ''[[Madama Butterfly]]'' and ''[[Turandot]]'' (as Liù; she played the title role in Toronto).

==Teaching career==
Since her official retirement from singing in 1989 Arroyo has amassed significant teaching credits, including stints at [[Louisiana State University]], [[University of California, Los Angeles|UCLA]], [[University of Delaware]], [[Wilberforce University]], the [[Universität Mozarteum Salzburg|International Sommerakademie-Mozarteum]] in [[Salzburg]] and [[Indiana University]].&lt;ref name="KCH"/&gt;&lt;ref name="JL"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT"/&gt;&lt;ref name="TNYT"/&gt;

She has given master classes nationally and internationally, and judged several competitions including the George London Competition and the [[International Tchaikovsky Competition|Tchaikovsky International Competition]]./With  [[Willard L. Boyd]], former President of the [[University of Iowa]], she co-authored the "Task Force Report on Music Education in the U.S."&lt;ref name="KCH"/&gt;&lt;ref name="JL"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT"/&gt;&lt;ref name="TNYT"/&gt;
==Honors==
In 1976, she was appointed by President [[Gerald Ford]] to the [[National Council of the Arts]] in Washington, D.C. She founded the Martina Arroyo Foundation,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Martina Arroyo Foundation|url=http://martinaarroyofdn.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is dedicated to the development of emerging young opera singers by immersing them in complete role preparation courses. She is also active on the Boards of Trustees of Hunter College and [[Carnegie Hall]]. She was elected a Fellow of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] in 2000.&lt;ref name=AAAS&gt;{{cite web|title=Book of Members, 1780–2010: Chapter A|url=http://www.amacad.org/publications/BookofMembers/ChapterA.pdf|publisher=American Academy of Arts and Sciences|accessdate=25 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="KCH"/&gt;&lt;ref name="JL"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT"/&gt;&lt;ref name="TNYT"/&gt; She was candid about her perceived status as second-best to her great contemporary, fellow [[African-American]] spinto [[Leontyne Price]]; once, when a Met doorman greeted her as "Miss Price," she sweetly replied, "No, honey, I'm the other one."&lt;ref name="KCH"/&gt;&lt;ref name="JL"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT"/&gt;&lt;ref name="TNYT"/&gt;

[[File:Monumenta Germaniae Historica.png|thumb|''Monumenta Germaniae Historica''.]]
The '''''Monumenta Germaniae Historica''''' (frequently abbreviated '''MGH''' in bibliographies and lists of sources) is a comprehensive series of carefully edited and published [[primary source]]s, both [[chronicle]] and [[Archives|archival]], for the study of [[History of Germany|German history]] (broadly conceived) from the end of the [[Roman Empire]] to 1500.&lt;ref name=Holland1910&gt;{{Citation

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the name, the series covers important sources for the history of many countries besides Germany, since the Society for the Publication of Sources on Germanic Affairs of the Middle Ages has included documents from many other areas subjected to the influence of Germanic tribes or rulers (Britain, Czech lands, Poland, Austria, France, Low Countries, Italy, Spain, etc.).  The editor from 1826 until 1874 was [[Georg Heinrich Pertz]] (1795–1876); in 1875 he was succeeded by [[Georg Waitz]] (1813-1886) .

==History==
The MGH was founded in Hanover as a private [[text publication society]] by the [[Prussia]]n reformer [[Heinrich Friedrich Karl vom und zum Stein|Heinrich Friedrich Karl Freiherr vom Stein]] in 1819. The first volume appeared in 1826. The editor from 1826 until 1874 was [[Georg Heinrich Pertz]], who was succeeded by [[Georg Waitz]]. Many eminent medievalists from Germany and, eventually, other countries, joined in the project of searching out and comparing manuscripts and producing scholarly editions. The motto chosen, ''Sanctus amor patriae dat animum'' ("Holy love for the fatherland gives the spirit") is explained as linking [[Romantic nationalism]] with professional scholarship. In 1875, the MGH was established as a more formal institution with headquarters in [[Berlin]]. 

In 1935, the organization was taken over by the state and renamed the ''Reichsinstitut für ältere deutsche Geschichtskunde'' (National Institute for Older German History). This was abolished in 1945, at the end of [[World War II]]. 

However, the institute was subsequently revived under its original name with the support of German institutions and the [[Austrian Academy of Sciences]].&lt;ref&gt;Knowles 1960.&lt;/ref&gt; The Monumenta Germaniae Historica Institute has been located in Munich since 1949 and possesses a large specialized library on the medieval history of Germany and Europe, including Church history, along with 130,000 monographs and approximately 150,000 dependent writings.&lt;!--Inhaltlich deckt die Bibliothek bzw. der frei zugängliche OPAC die mittelalterliche Geschichte Deutschlands und Europas mit Berücksichtigung der Kirchengeschichte ab. Der OPAC weist neben 130.000 Monographien auch ca. 150.000 unselbständige Schriften nach.--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bib-bvb.de/bib_schule/infoblatt4-geschichte-theologie.pdf |title=BibliotheksVerbund Bayern |accessdate=2008-09-17 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721100240/http://www.bib-bvb.de/bib_schule/infoblatt4-geschichte-theologie.pdf |archivedate=July 21, 2011 |df= }} {{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; It moved into its current premises in the building of the [[Bavarian State Library]] in 1967.

The project, a major effort of historical scholarship, continues in the 21st century. In 2004 the MGH, with the support of the [[Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft]], made all of its publications in print for more than five years available online, in photo-digital reproduction, via a link on the MGH homepage.

==Divisions==
The series falls into five main divisions, ''Antiquitates'', ''Diplomata'', ''Epistolae'', ''Leges'' and ''Scriptores'', with an additional smaller division of ''Necrologia''. Many subsidiary series have also been established, including a series of more compact volumes for school use (''Scriptores in usum scholarum'') and special studies (''MGH Schriften'').

'''Moscow State School 57''' ({{lang-ru|Пятьдесят седьмая школа}}) is a public school located in the [[Khamovniki District]] of [[Moscow]], [[Russia]]. The school was founded in 1877 and is best known for its specialized secondary program in mathematics and its alumni.&lt;ref name=book&gt;{{cite book |last=Vogeli |first=Bruce |date=2015 |title=Special Secondary Schools for the Mathematically Talented |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Q1kGCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA41 |location= |publisher=World Scientific |page= |isbn=9789814667487}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

=== Founding and School 4 (1877–1968) ===
[[File:Shkola 57.jpg|thumb|The school circa 1877.]]

In 1877, {{ill|Karl Masing|ru|Мазинг, Карл Карлович}}, a Russian engineer and educator, founded a [[realschule]] in Maly Znamensky Lane,&lt;ref name=KarlMasing&gt;{{cite web|url=http://um.mos.ru/en/personalities/35799/ |title=Karl Masing |publisher=Discover Moscow |date= |accessdate=2016-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; which soon became one of the most progressive vocational schools in Russia.&lt;ref name=ug&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ug.ru/archive/57168 |title=Успех учеников - успех школы|trans-title=The success of pupils is the success of schools|work=Uchitelskaya Gazeta Moskva|issue=34|date=26 August 2014|access-date=2018-11-07|language=ru}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the [[October Revolution]], the realschule was converted into a boarding school with courses in aesthetic arts and renamed to School 4. It became popular with the Soviet establishment, with top government officials sending their children there.&lt;ref name=M24&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_mKQvp3wyc/ |title="Познавательный фильм": Школа №57 -- братство умников и умниц|trans-title="Educational film": School No. 57 -- the brotherhood of brainies |publisher=[[Moscow 24 (TV channel)|Moscow 24]]|date=11 March 2014 |accessdate=2016-10-27|via=YouTube|language=ru}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1936, the school was transformed again, converting back to a vocational school and acquiring the number 57 in Moscow's educational system.&lt;ref name="mendelevich"&gt;{{cite interview|url=http://www.polit.ru/article/2005/08/31/piatsem/|title=Сергей Менделевич: Я - &amp;laquo;пятидесятисемит&amp;raquo;|trans-title=Sergey Mendelevich: I am a "fiftysemite"|interviewer=Leonid Kleyn|date=31 August 2005|publisher=polit.ru|accessdate=2016-10-27|language=ru}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Math classes and new campuses (1968–present) ===

[[File:Moscow, M.Znamenskiy 7 str 8 (2010s) by shakko 01.jpg|thumb|School 57 today]]

In 1968, [[Nikolay Konstantinov]], a leading Russian educator in mathematics, established specialized math classes at the school. Konstantinov's teaching methodology still is used in these classes to this day and has been shared with other educational centers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Gerovitch|first=Slava|url=http://web.mit.edu/slava/homepage/articles/Gerovitch-Parallel-Worlds.pdf|title=Parallel Worlds: Formal Structures and Informal Mechanisms of Postwar Soviet Mathematics|publisher=Massachusetts Institute of Technology}}&lt;/ref&gt; The school started gaining prestige due to the quality of education it provided.

As of 2016, School 57 is a highly selective school with a competitive admission process. The high school offers specializations in humanities, biology, and mathematics, as well as a general track. In 2008–2013, the school merged with two other schools in different locations of the Khamovniki District of Moscow, in conformity with the recent reforms in educational policy.

==Enrollment ==
The school has a total enrollment of over a thousand students, entering first, eighth and ninth grade.

Admission&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sch57.ru/files/admiss1.pdf|title=Положение о порядке приема обучающихся в Государственное бюджетное образовательное учреждение города Москвы центр образования № 57 &amp;laquo;Пятьдесят седьмая школа&amp;raquo;|trans-title = Admission regulations |website=sch57.ru|language=ru}}&lt;/ref&gt; to elementary school is competitive and based on test results of the students previously enrolled in the school's tuition-based mandatory preschool program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sch57.ru/admission/prep.html#pre|title=Группы развивающего обучения|trans-title=Preparatory classes|website=sch57.ru|language=ru}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 2015, the admission committee considered over a thousand applicants for 130 positions. By maintaining good standing the students can guarantee their further education in the school's general track middle and high school. As is the tradition in many Russian schools, incoming students are split into a number of groups of 20–30 which each have their own curricula and teachers.

School 57 has general track classes along with its specialized programs and holds a separate admission process for specialized classes in mathematics, humanities&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Shapiro|first=Natalia|url=http://sch57.ru/publications/humanities.html|title=Гуманитарные классы|trans-title=Humanities classes|website=sch57.ru|language=ru}}&lt;/ref&gt; and biology, a joint project&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fbb.msu.ru/doc/index.php?ID=224|title=Биологический класс 57-й школы г. Москвы|trans-title=Biology classes at Moscow's School 57|publisher=Faculty of Bioengineering and Bioinformatics, Lomonosov Moscow State University|language=ru}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the school and the {{Interlanguage link|MSU Faculty of Bioengineering and Bioinformatics|ru|3=Факультет биоинженерии и биоинформатики МГУ|lt=Faculty of Bioengineering and Bioinformatics}} of [[Moscow State University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.fbb.msu.ru/|title=Faculty of Bioengineering and Bioinformatics|publisher=Moscow State University}}&lt;/ref&gt; The admission committee considers a few hundred applicants for 20–25 places in each class.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://sch57.ru/admission/|title=Приём в школу|trans-title =Admission to the school|website=sch57.ru|language=ru}}&lt;/ref&gt;

School 57 launches two math classes each year, with four- and three-year curriculums, each admitting around 20–25 students who have demonstrated the best problem-solving abilities during the application process. The school organizes free preparatory courses that help interested students to develop said abilities. A portfolio that includes prizes from math competitions can strengthen an application.&lt;ref name="book"/&gt;

== Academics ==
Students in the specialized classes receive extensive training in their areas of expertise, often covering college-level material in their junior and senior years. Graduates of the specialized classes often go on to pursue college degrees in Russia's best universities,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Collier|first=Sabrina |url=http://www.topuniversities.com/university-rankings-articles/brics-rankings/top-10-universities-russia-2016|title=Top 10 Universities in Russia 2016|publisher=TopUniversities|date=25 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; including the [[National Research University – Higher School of Economics|Higher School of Economics]], [[Moscow State University]], and the [[Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Vityuk|first1=Kseniya|last2=Gofman|first2=Anna |last3=Ivanova-Gladilshchikova|first3= Natalia |last4= Ivanova|first4=Anastasia|last5=Stulikova|first5=Alina|url = http://bg.ru/education/luchshie_shkoly_moskvy-17683/?chapter=2|title =Лучшие школы Москвы. Топ-20|trans-title=The best schools of Moscow. Top 20|work=Bolshoy Gorod|date=22 April 2013|language=ru}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Mathematics classes ===

Individual approach lies in the core of the specialized math classes' educational process. Teaching the specialized math classes isn't limited to faculty staff – additional instructors, many of whom are volunteering alumni, are involved in order to give every student necessary attention. Rather than having to learn the material from a textbook, students discover it through solving sequences of problems. Solutions are presented by the students to the instructors in one-on-one discussions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1= Yurkevich|first1= Victoria|last2=Davidovich|first2=Boris|chapter=Russian strategies for talent development: stimulating comfort and discomfort|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/?id=T8Rn12ksQz0C&amp;pg=PT140&amp;lpg=PT140&amp;dq=moscow+school+57+davidovich#v=onepage&amp;q=moscow%20school%2057%20davidovich&amp;f=false|title=The Routledge International Companion to Gifted Education|editor-last1=Balchin|editor-first1=Tom|editor-last2=Hymer|editor-first2=Barry |editor-last3=Matthews|editor-first3=Dona J. |publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781136028861|date=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; This method, introduced by Konstantinov, proved to be effective and was adopted by other educational institutions in both Russia and abroad, including School 179, the [[Independent University of Moscow]] and the [[HSE Faculty of Mathematics|Faculty of Mathematics]] at Higher School of Economics. Several School 57 teachers have also written textbooks&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1 = Davidovich|first1=Boris|last2=Pushkar|first2=Pyotr |last3=Chekanov|first3=Yuri |title=Математический анализ в 57-й школе.

== Extracurricular activities==
School 57 offers a number of free courses for middle schoolers preparing students who intend to apply to the mathematics, humanities and biology classes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sch57.ru/nightsch.html|title=Наши кружки|trans-title=Our circles|website=sch57.ru|language=ru}}&lt;/ref&gt; The math program includes weekly problem solving sets for sixth-, seventh- and eighth-graders, some of the courses are published.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Dorichenko|first=Sergey|title=A Moscow Math Circle: Week-by-week Problem Sets|url=https://books.google.com/?id=3DZ-AwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PR11&amp;dq=math+57+school+moscow#v=onepage&amp;q=math%2057%20school%20moscow&amp;f=false|translator-last=Shubin |translator-first= Tatiana |publisher=MSRI|isbn=978-0-8218-6874-4|date=2011|page=xi}}&lt;/ref&gt; The biology track includes lectures in math, biology and chemistry for eighth graders, and future humanities students study literature and history. All of the courses take place in the first, historical building of the school on Maly Znamensky Lane. The school also offers a number of clubs for students of each of its three buildings, including a chess club, film club, ceramics club, theater club (both puppet theater and drama) and a course preparing for [[Test of English as a Foreign Language|TOEFL]] and [[International English Language Testing System|IELTS]] standardized English tests.

Class vacations, including those involving intense work (lectures, presentations, field trips), are popular in the school, though not mandated by the administration. Math classes usually tend to have mountain hiking journeys, while humanities classes organize urban trips, focusing on cultural and historical studies. Since 1996 the school worked together with the [[Chersonesus|Tauric Chersonese]] museum to organize volunteers from the number of students and alumni to work and learn on different archaeological sites in the area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Pronina|first1=Margarita|last2=Fomin|first2=Dmitry|url=http://nts-tv.com/rubriki/istoriya_sevastopolya/21955/23786/|title=20 лет на Маячном полуострове Севастополя &amp;laquo;Гераклейская экспедиция&amp;raquo; ведет раскопки &amp;laquo;Страбонова Херсонеса&amp;raquo;|trans-title=Digs in Chersonesus|publisher=Independent Television of Sevastopol|date=10 August 2016|language=ru}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite interview|last=Sedikova|first=Larisa|title=Зачем гражданину Путину нужна присяга граждан Херсонеса?|trans-title=Why Citizen Putin needs an oath from the citizens of Chersonesus|url=http://nsn.fm/culture/zachem-putinu-ponadobilas-prisyaga-grazhdan-khersonesa.php|publisher=National News Agency|date=30 September 2015|accessdate=2015-09-30|language=ru}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Every 1st Saturday of February, the school celebrates its birthday, and current students arrange entertainment for the alumni, including refreshments, skits, and games, including {{Interlanguage link|The Hat game|ru|3=Шляпа (игра)}}. The alumni, in turn, come up with intellectual contests for students.

==Controversies==
In August 2016, several school graduates publicly accused two school teachers of [[sexual misconduct]] and the school administration of deliberate concealment of these misconducts. This scandal led to the retirement of the principal Sergey Mendelevich. The school is still undergoing legal investigation as of November 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Litvinova|first=Daria |url=https://themoscowtimes.com/articles/school-57-55248|title=Sexual Assault Scandal Hits Elite Moscow School, Rocks Russian Intelligentsia|work=The Moscow Times|date=7 September 2016|access-date=2018-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ohio Technical College''' is a private automotive technical college located in [[Cleveland]], [[Ohio]], United States.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thefabricator.com/news/arcwelding/ohio-technical-college-lincoln-electric-team-up-with-boy-scouts-to-promote-welding-badge "Ohio Technical College, Lincoln Electric team up with Boy Scouts to promote Welding Badge"]. ''The Fabricator'', April 28, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; It offered its first classes in 1969 as Ohio Diesel Mechanics School. OTC offers programs in automotive, auto-diesel, collision, diesel, manufacturer, motor sports, PowerSport, restoration and welding.

== History ==

In 1969, Ohio Diesel Mechanics School offered one 6-week course with phases in Cummins 4-stroke engine, Detroit 2-stroke engine and basic diesel fundamentals. In 1972, the school’s name changed to Ohio Diesel Technical Institute, and, in 1981, automotive diesel was added to the curriculum. In 1984, an Automotive Technology program was added. In 1987, the Motorcycle and Small Engine Training program was added, following a name change to Ohio Auto/Diesel Technical Institute. A new Associate of Technical Studies degree program was developed and approved in 1994. Because of its new degree-granting ability, the school was renamed Ohio Auto Diesel Technical College the following year.

In 2000, BMW of North America entered into contract with OTC to provide the FAST Track program, which stands for Factory Advanced Skilled Training. In 2003, High Performance and Racing and Alternative Fuel Technology classes were added to the curriculum. Over the next few years, additional programs were added, including a Custom Paint and Graphics specialization program,&lt;ref name="Levit2008"&gt;{{cite book|author=Alexandra Levit|title=How'd You Score That Gig?: A Guide to the Coolest Jobs-and How to Get Them|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VlpNdkJzjNYC&amp;pg=PA207|date=15 April 2008|publisher=Random House Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-345-50480-7|pages=207–}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Complete Automotive Technology program, and the Alternative Fuels and High Performance and Racing program. In 2008, the PowerSport Institute (PSI) branch campus was completed and played host to OTC's motorcycle technician training division. In 2010, OTC partnered with Edelbrock to offer a 12-week course that focuses on building and tuning American muscle cars and performance vehicles.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.streetlegaltv.com/news/students-of-ohio-technical-college-build-a-%E2%80%9957-chevy-for-edelbrock/ "Students of Ohio Technical College Build a ’57 Chevy for Edelbrock"].

''Cleveland - Freshwater Media''.&lt;/ref&gt;

The college's expanding program has resulted in it being included several times appeared on the Weatherhead list of the 100 fastest growing companies in Northeast Ohio.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.autobodynews.com/news/industry-news/item/5603-ohio-technical-college-earns-2011-weatherhead-100-award.html Ohio Technical College Earns 2011 Weatherhead 100 Award."] ''Autobody News''&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010 the college had about 1,000 students;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cleveland.com/business/index.ssf/2010/10/randall_park_mall_makeover_mov.html "Randall Park Mall makeover moves along; Ohio Technical College might move there from Cleveland"]. ''cleveland.com''.&lt;/ref&gt; the new programs raised this to 1,500 in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.crainscleveland.com/article/20111017/CFO11/310179987 "Kathleen Dillon"].

==Overview==
Rehabilitation robotics can be considered a specific focus of [[biomedical engineering]], and a part of [[human-robot interaction]]. In this field, clinicians, therapists, and engineers collaborate to help rehabilitate patients.{{fact|date=July 2016}}

Prominent goals in the field include: developing implementable technologies that can be easily used by patients, therapists, and clinicians; enhancing the efficacy of clinician's therapies; and increasing the ease of activities in the daily lives of patients.{{fact|date=July 2016}}

==History==

The International Conference on Rehabilitation Robotics occurs every two years, with the first conference in 1989. The most recent conference was held in July 2017 in London (UK), while the next ICORR conference will be held in June 2019 in Toronto, as part of the [https://www.rehabweek.org/ RehabWeek]. Rehabilitation robotics was introduced two decades ago for patients who have [[neurological disorders]]. The people that you will most commonly find using rehabilitation robots are disabled people or [[Therapy|therapists]].&lt;ref name="coco"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Carrera |first1=Isela |last2=Moreno |first2=Héctor A. |last3=Saltarén |first3=Roque |last4=Pérez |first4=Carlos |last5=Puglisi |first5=Lisandro |last6=Garcia |first6=Cecilia |title=ROAD: domestic assistant and rehabilitation robot |journal=Medical &amp; Biological Engineering &amp; Computing |volume=49 |issue=10 |pages=1201–11 |year=2011 |pmid=21789672 |doi=10.1007/s11517-011-0805-4 |url=http://oa.upm.es/13705/ |type=Submitted manuscript }}&lt;/ref&gt; When the rehabilitation robots were created they were not intended to be recovery robots but to help people recognizing objects through touch and for people who suffered from [[Nervous system disease|nervous system disorder]]. Rehabilitation robots are used in the recuperation process of disabled patients in standing up, balancing and [[gait]].&lt;ref name="coco"/&gt;  These robots must keep up with a human and their movement, therefore in the making of the machine the makers need to be sure that it will be consistent with the progress of the patient. Much rigorous work is put into the design because the robot will work with people who have disabilities and will not be able to react quickly in case something goes wrong.&lt;ref name= "lala"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Munih |first1=Marko |last2=Bajd |first2=Tadej |title=Rehabilitation robotics |journal=Technology and Health Care |volume=19 |issue=6 |pages=483–95 |year=2011 |pmid=22129949 |doi=10.3233/THC-2011-0646 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Function==
Rehabilitation robots are designed with applications of techniques that determine the [[adaptability]] level of the patient. Techniques include but are not limited to active assisted exercise, active constrained exercise, active resistive exercise, passive exercise, and adaptive exercise. In active assisted exercise, the patient moves his or her hand in a predetermined pathway without any force pushing against it. Active constrained exercise is the movement of the patient’s arm with an opposing force; if it tries to move outside of what it is supposed to. Active resistive exercise is the movement with opposing forces.&lt;ref&gt;http://web.ebscohost.com/ehost/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?sid=5ecab354-724d-427f-a5cd-38090fcf44b0%40sessionmgr112&amp;vid=8&amp;hid=103{{full|date=July 2016}}{{dead link|date=July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; These machines MIT-Manus,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.inmotionrobots.com{{full|date=July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bi-Manu-Track&lt;ref&gt;http://www.reha-stim.de/cms/index.php?id=60{{full|date=July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and MIME make the active resistive exercise possible. Passive exercise needs to be pushed from the patient. Finally, an adaptive exercise is an excessive workout that the robot has never done and is adapting to the new unknown pathway.  These devices Bi-ManuTrack and MIME support the adaptive exercise possible. The active constrained exercise is supported by all the machines that are mentioned.&lt;ref name="lala"/&gt;

Over the years the number of rehabilitation robotics has grown but they are very limited due to the clinical trials. Many clinics have trials but do not accept the robots because they wish they were remotely controlled. Having Robots involved in the rehabilitation of a patient has a few positive aspects. One of the positive aspects is the fact that you can repeat the process or exercise as many times as you wish. Another positive aspect is the fact that you can get exact measurements of their improvement or decline. You can get the exact measurements through the sensors on the device. While the device is taking a measurement you need to be careful because the device can be disrupted once it is done because of the different movements the patient does to get out.&lt;ref name="lala"/&gt; The rehabilitation robot can apply constant therapy for long periods. The rehabilitation robot is a wonderful device to use according to many therapists, scientists, and patients that have gone through the therapy. In the process of a recovery the rehabilitation robot is unable to understand the patient’s needs like a well experienced therapist would.&lt;ref name="coco"/&gt; The robot is unable to understand now but in the future the device will be able to understand. Another plus of having a rehabilitation robot is that there is no physical effort put into work by the therapist.

Lately, rehabilitation robotics have been used in training medicine, surgery, [[remote surgery]] and other things, but there have been too many complaints about the robot not being controlled by a remote. Many people would think that using an [[industrial robot]] as a rehabilitation robot would be the same thing, but this is not true. Rehabilitation robots need to be adjustable and programmable, because the robot can be used for multiple reasons. Meanwhile, an industrial robot is always the same; there is no need to change the robot unless the product it is working with is bigger or smaller. In order for an industrial robot to work it would have to me more adjustable to its new task.&lt;ref name="lala"/&gt;

==Current products==
Hand of Hope is an intention-driven exoskeleton hand that focuses on improving motion of the hand and fingers in stroke victims, developed by Rehab-Robotics. The robotic hand is controlled by EMG signals in the forearm muscles, meaning that patients can move their hand using only their brain. The device also has a continuous passive motion mode, where the actions of hand opening and closing are done involuntarily. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last1=Tong |first1=K Y |last2=Ho |first2=S K |last3=Pang |first3=P M K |last4=Hu |first4=X L |last5=Tam |first5=W K |last6=Fung |first6=K L |last7=Wei |first7=X J |last8=Chen |first8=P N |last9=Chen |first9=M |title=An intention driven hand functions task training robotic system |journal=2010 Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology |volume=2010 |issue= |pages=3406–9 |year=2010 |pmid=21097247 |doi=10.1109/IEMBS.2010.5627930 |isbn=978-1-4244-4123-5 |hdl=10397/38074 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ekso Bionics]] is currently developing and manufacturing intelligently [[powered exoskeleton]] [[Bionics|bionic]] devices that can be strapped on as [[wearable robots]] to enhance the strength, mobility, and endurance of soldiers and paraplegics. Tyromotion is currently developing and manufacturing a set of intelligent rehabilitation devices for the upper extremity. The hand rehabilitation robot called AMADEO offers a range of rehabilitation strategies including passive, assistive, ROM, force and haptic training. The arm rehabilitation robot called DIEGO offers bilateral arm therapy including assistive force for weight reduction and full 3D tracking of the arm movement for augemented feedback training in a virtual reality environment.{{fact|date=July 2016}}

==Reasons to use this device==
The number of disabled people in Spain had gone up due to aging. This means the number of assistance has gone up. The rehabilitation robot is very popular in Spain because it is an acceptable cost, and there are many people in Spain that has strokes and need assistance afterward. Rehabilitation robotics are very popular with people who have suffered a stroke because the proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation method is applied. When you suffer a stroke your nervous system becomes damage in most cases causing people to have disability for six months after the stroke. The robot would be able to carry out exercises a therapist would carry out but the robot will do some exercises that are not so easy to be carried out by a human being.&lt;ref name="coco"/&gt; The pneumatic robot helps people who have had strokes or any other illness that has caused a disorder with their upper limb&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Tefertiller |first1=Candace |last2=Pharo |first2=Beth |last3=Evans |first3=Nicholas |last4=Winchester |first4=Patricia |title=Efficacy of rehabilitation robotics for walking training in neurological disorders: A review |journal=The Journal of Rehabilitation Research and Development |volume=48 |issue=4 |pages=387–416 |year=2011 |pmid=21674390 |doi=10.1682/JRRD.2010.04.0055 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2018 review on the effectiveness of mirror therapy by virtual reality and robotics for any type of pathology concluded that: 1) Much of the research on second-generation mirror therapy is of very low quality; 2) Evidence-based rationale to conduct such studies is missing; 3) It is not relevant to recommend investment by rehabilitation professionals and institutions in such devices. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Darbois|first=Nelly|last2=Guillaud|first2=Albin|last3=Pinsault|first3=Nicolas |date=2018|title= Does Robotics and Virtual Reality Add Real Progress to Mirror Therapy Rehabilitation?

==Types of Robots==
There are different types of robots that can be used in the results of a stroke. The InMotion 2&lt;ref&gt;http://web.ebscohost.com/ehost/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?sid=5ecab354-724d-427f-a5cd-38090fcf44b0%40sessionmgr112&amp;vid=9&amp;hid=103{{full|date=July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; can be used, it allows participates to practice reaching movement in [[horizontal plane]] with a reduction of gravity. The motions that are performed require shoulder flexion and extension and external rotation. It is very easy to set up the usage of this robot. The procedure of using this robot is the following. The participant sits down at a desk and places her or his into a trough. Then the participants’ looks at a computer screen and try to reach out for the target. As you are reaching out for the target the device gives guidance so that your therapy can be successful.&lt;ref name="nice"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Flinn |first1=Nancy A. |last2=Smith |first2=Jennifer L. |last3=Tripp |first3=Christopher J. |last4=White |first4=Matthew W. |title=Effects of robotic-aided rehabilitation on recovery of upper extremity function in chronic stroke: a single case study |journal=Occupational Therapy International |volume=16 |issue=3–4 |pages=232–43 |year=2009 |pmid=19593735 |doi=10.1002/oti.280 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another example of rehabilitation robot is called Hipbot. The Hipbot is a robot used in patients with limited mobility. The [[hip]] is an important joint in the human body, it supports our weight and allows the movement and statically position. When people suffer a fracture by an accident or have problems in this location, need to improve a rehabilitation process. This robot helps in this cases, because it combines movements of abduction/adduction and flexion/extension that help the patients to restore their mobility. The robot has 5 degree of freedom mechanism necessary to all positions for the rehab, it is controlled by a PID controller and can be used for both legs (separately).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = HipBot – The design, development and control of a therapeutic robot for hip rehabilitation|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0957415815000914|journal = Mechatronics|date = 2015-09-01|pages = 55–64|volume = 30|doi = 10.1016/j.mechatronics.2015.06.007|first = C.

Some workers are working on robots that support a patient’s body, so that the patient can concentrate on something else while he or she is walking.&lt;ref name="coco"/&gt;

==Current Areas of Research==
Current robotic devices include [[exoskeletons]] for aiding limb or hand movement such as the Tibion Bionic Leg, the Myomo Neuro-robotic System, MRISAR's STRAC (Symbiotic Terrain Robotic Assist Chair) and the [[Berkeley Bionics]] eLegs; enhanced treadmills such as [[Hocoma|Hocoma's Lokomat]]; robotic arms to retrain motor movement of the limb such as the MIT-MANUS, and finger rehabilitation devices such as tyromotion's AMADEO. Some devices are meant to aid strength development of specific motor movements, while others seek to aid these movements directly. Often robotic technologies attempt to leverage the principles of [[neuroplasticity]] by improving quality of movement, and increasing the intensity and repetition of the task.  Over the last two decades, research into robot mediated therapy for the [[Rehabilitation (neuropsychology)|rehabilitation]] of [[stroke]] patients has grown significantly as the potential for cheaper and more effective therapy has been identified.&lt;ref name=Hillman&gt;{{cite book |last1=Hillman |first1=Michael |chapter=2 Rehabilitation Robotics from Past to Present – A Historical Perspective |pages=25–44 |doi=10.1007/10946978_2 |chapterurl={{Google books|J8DLT81SSH4C|page=25|plainurl=yes}} |editor1-first=Z.

The MIT-MANUS in particular has been studied as a means of providing individualized, continuous therapy to patients who have suffered a [[stroke]] by using a performance-based progressive algorithm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Krebs |first1=H.I. |last2=Palazzolo |first2=J.J. |last3=Dipietro |first3=L. |last4=Ferraro |first4=M. |last5=Krol |first5=J. |last6=Rannekleiv |first6=K. |last7=Volpe |first7=B.T. |last8=Hogan |first8=N. |title=Rehabilitation Robotics: Performance-Based Progressive Robot-Assisted Therapy |journal=Autonomous Robots |volume=15 |issue=1 |year=2003 |pages=7–20 |doi=10.1023/A:1024494031121 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The responsive software allows the robot to alter the amount of assistance it provides, based on the patient's speed and timing of movement.  This allows for a more personalized treatment session without the need for constant therapist interaction.  An additional benefit to this type of adaptive robotic therapy is a marked decrease in [[spasticity]] and [[muscle tone]] in the affected arm.  Different spatial orientations of the robot allow for horizontal or vertical motion, or a combination in a variety of planes.&lt;ref name=Krebs /&gt;  The vertical, [[anti-gravity]] setting is particularly useful for improving shoulder and elbow function.{{fact|date=July 2016}}

Rehabilitation robotics may also include [[virtual reality]] technology.{{fact|date=July 2016}}

'''Robert Sward''' (born 1933) is an American and Canadian poet and novelist. [[Jack Foley (poet)|Jack Foley]], in his Introduction to Sward's ''Collected Poems, 1957–2004'' (Black Moss Press, 2004) calls him, "in truth, a citizen, at heart, of both countries. At once a Canadian and American poet, one with a foot in both worlds, Sward also inhabits an enormous in-between." Or, as Rainer Maria Rilke puts it, "Every artist is born in an alien country; he has a homeland nowhere but within his own borders."

==Early years==

Born in 1933 and raised in Chicago, Illinois, Sward began writing poetry at the age of 15 when he became involved with a street gang and used rhyming couplets in his notes to the other gang members. He graduated from [[Von Steuben High School]] at 17 and quit his job as a [[soda jerk]] in a pharmacy to join the [[United States Navy]]. In 1952 he was stationed in [[Korea]] on an amphibious ship, LST 914. A [[Yeoman]] 3rd Class, Sward soon became the head of the ship's library, while serving in the combat zone during the [[Korean War]].

==University==
He has taught at [[Cornell University]], 1964–65, where he first experimented with computer-generated poetry and served on the editorial board of ''[[Epoch (magazine)|Epoch]]''. He went on to teach at the [[Iowa Writers' Workshop]], the [[University of Victoria]], and the [[University of California, Santa Cruz]].

==Working in media==
In the 1980s he worked for the [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|CBC]], where he interviewed and produced 60-minute radio features on [[Leonard Cohen]], [[Margaret Atwood]], [[Earle Birney]], [[John Robert Colombo]], [[Al Purdy]], [[Gwendolyn MacEwen]], and other leading Canadian figures.  His ''[[Quill &amp; Quire]]'' interview with Nobel prize winner, [[Saul Bellow]], was widely read. Sward also worked as journalist, book reviewer and feature writer for ''[[The Toronto Star]]'', ''[[The Globe and Mail]]'', and ''[[The Financial Times]]'' in [[Toronto]], Ontario while living on the [[Toronto Islands]]. He received a [[Canada Council]] grant to research and write ''The Toronto Islands'' (1983), a best-selling (Source: Dreadnaught Press publisher, 1983) illustrated history of a unique community, from prehistoric times to the present.

==Awards==
A [[Fulbright Scholar]] and [[Guggenheim Fellow]], he was chosen by Lucille Clifton to receive a Villa Montalvo Literary Arts Award and is the author of 30 books of poetry, fiction and nonfiction. He has been published widely in numerous anthologies and traditional literary magazines, such as ''[[The New Yorker]]'', ''[[Poetry Chicago]]'', and ''[[The Hudson Review]]''. Sward later worked as technical writer and editor for Santa Cruz Operation (SCO), and served as "bridge person" between traditional hard copy academic periodicals and literary eZines.

In September 2016, at Second Annual Voices of the River Poetry Celebration, supported by a grant from Arts Council Santa Cruz County, sponsored by Bookshop Santa Cruz, Poetry Santa Cruz and the Coastal Watershed Council, Robert Sward was named Poet Laureate of Santa Cruz County, 2016–2018.

The preceding Poet Laureates included Gary Young, David Swanger and Ellen Bass&lt;ref&gt;http://www.santacruzsentinel.com/article/NE/20160805/FEATURES/160809741&lt;/ref&gt;

==Internet publishing==
He began publishing on the Internet in the late 1980s and early 90s with appearances in ''Alsop Review'', ''Blue Moon Review'', ''Web de Sol'', ''X-Connect'', ''eSCENE'', ''Fiction Online'', ''Hawk'', ''Realpoetik'', and ''Zero City''. His essay, "Why I Publish in e-Zines", appeared online in 1995 and has been widely reprinted. Sward's "Earthquake Collage," impressions, news items, poetry, and facts regarding the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake and its aftermath, appeared in "Pathways to the Past, Adventures in Santa Cruz County History, History Journal Number 6," Museum of Art and History, Santa Cruz, CA, April 2009.

As well as MonoBlogAlz.com which was created as a memorial for his late wife Gloria K. Alford 1928–2017, a well known West Coast visual artist.

==Books==
[[File:New &amp; Collected Poems 1957-2015.jpg|thumb|318x318px|New &amp; Collected Poems forthcoming|left]]
Sward's first book, ''Uncle Dog &amp; Other Poems'' (1962), was published by Putnam &amp; Co. in England. It was followed by ''Kissing the Dancer'' (Cornell University Press, 1964), with an Introduction by Pulitzer Prize poet [[William Morris Meredith, Jr.|William Meredith]]. ''The Carleton Miscellany'' reviewed the book saying, "In the animal poems there is a bravery in the face of our limitations, a warmth for our absurdities, a way of life to be gleaned from our failings and ineptitudes... a self-critique that turns our freakishness into an ironic source of fulfillment and transcendence." Source: Theodore Holmes in "The Carleton Miscellany" 1964. The poem, "Uncle Dog: The Poet At 9", has been frequently anthologized and Sward continues to write about exotic animals and dogs in particular. Animated videos of these works (mini-movies with poetry) employ avatars, digital representations of the poet and his subjects, and appear in DVD format and online at Blue's Cruzio Cafe.

A key theme in his most recent books, ''Rosicrucian in the Basement'' (2001), ''Heavenly Sex'' (2002), ''The Collected Poems, 1957–2004'' (2004), and ''God is in the Cracks'' (2006), is fathers and sons. Sward's father, Dr. Irving M. Sward, was a podiatrist and something of a mystic, combining his practice of Rosicrucianism with a study of the Kabbalah. Of ''Rosicrucian in the Basement'', [[Robert Bly]] writes, 'There are many mysteries between father and son that people don't talk about... There's much leaping [in Sward's poetry], but each line, so to speak, steps on something solid.'  In commenting on the father and son series [[Dana Gioia]] adds, "The CD is terrific... ''Rosicrucian in the Basement'' unfolds perfectly at its own pace and never loses the listener." Source: ''Robert Sward: Poetry, Review &amp; Interview with Jack Foley, Recorded for KPFA-FM Berkeley, CA with readings from Heavenly Sex &amp; Rosicrucian in the Basement'' (2002), ''Uncle Dog Audio'', Number 1002 (2002), and ''The Collected Poems,''  Black Moss Press,''1957–2004'' (2004).

[[Garrison Keillor]] selected ''God is in the Cracks'', one of the father and son poems and title poem of Sward's 2006 collection, for broadcast on his radio show "Writer's Almanac."&lt;ref&gt;http://writersalmanac.publicradio.org/index.php?date=2003/03/22&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://jjwebb.ihwy.com/rosycrossfather/godisinthecracks_keillor.mp3&lt;/ref&gt;

==Family==
Sward and his life-partner, visual artist Gloria K. Alford (1928–2017), lived in [[Santa Cruz, California|Santa Cruz]], California, where he took up residence in 1985, after fourteen years living and working in Canada, primarily in Victoria, B.C. (1969–1979) and on the Toronto Islands (1979–1985). A member of the League of Canadian Poets since 1975, Sward has toured Canada with each of his new books, reviewed and helped bring noted Canadian writers to the U.S.

Sward's five children include Cheryl Cox Macpherson, a Professor of Bioethics; Kamala Joy, an environmental scientist; Michael Sward, a contractor and builder; Hannah Sward, a Los Angeles based fiction writer; and Nicholas Sward, a Toronto-based executive chef.

His literary correspondence and papers are housed at University Libraries, Washington University in St. Louis, Department of Special Collections, Olin Library, St. Louis, MO 63130. (WTU00110). Additionally Robert's papers are collected at the National Library of Canada in Ottawa, and at the University of Victoria library, Special Collections, in Victoria, British Columbia.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8295">'''Slow reading''' is the intentional reduction in the speed of [[reading (process)|reading]], carried out to increase comprehension or pleasure. The concept appears to have originated in the study of [[philosophy]] and [[literature]] as a technique to more fully comprehend and appreciate a complex [[Text (literary theory)|text]]. More recently, there has been increased interest in slow reading as result of the [[Slow movement (culture)|slow movement]] and its focus on decelerating the pace of modern life. {{citation needed|date=November 2015}}

== Related terms ==

The use of slow reading in literary criticism is sometimes referred to as [[close reading]]. Of less common usage is the term, "deep reading".&lt;ref name=Birkerts1994 &gt;Birkerts, Sven. (1994). ''The Gutenberg Elegies: The Fate of Reading in an Electronic Age''. Boston: Faber and Faber.  [http://archives.obs-us.com/obs/english/books/nn/bdbirk.htm Selected passages], Open Book Systems]&lt;/ref&gt; Slow reading is contrasted with [[speed reading]] which involves techniques to increase the rate of reading without adversely affecting comprehension, and contrasted with [[Skimming (reading)|skimming]]  which employs visual page cues to increase reading speed. {{citation needed|date=November 2015}}

== Philosophy and literature ==

The earliest reference to slow reading appears to be in [[Nietzsche]]'s  preface to the 1887 ''[[The Dawn (book)|Daybreak]]'': "It is not for nothing that one has been a [[Philology|philologist]], perhaps one is a philologist still, that is to say, a teacher of slow reading."&lt;ref&gt;[[Friedrich Nietzsche]],  (1887) ''Morgenro:te: Gedanken u:ber die moralischen Vorurteile'' (1881). "Man ist nicht umsonst Philologe gewesen, man ist es vielleicht noch, das will sagen, ein Lehrer des langsamen Lesens: - endlich schreibt man auch langsam."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nietzsche, Friedrich (1887)''Daybreak: Thoughts on the Prejudices of Morality''. 2nd Edition.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Sven Birkerts|Birkerts]], in his book ''The Gutenberg Elegies'', stated "Reading, because we control it, is adaptable to our needs and rhythms. We are free to indulge our subjective associative impulse; the term I coin for this is deep reading: the slow and meditative possession of a book."&lt;ref name=Birkerts1994 /&gt;  Birkerts' emphasis  on the importance of personal control over the speed of reading is echoed by [[Philip Pullman|Pullman]], who additionally argued that taking control of the pace of one's reading is a form of personal freedom, and develops an appreciation of democracy.&lt;ref&gt;Pullman, P. (2004). The War on Words. [http://books.guardian.co.uk/departments/politicsphilosophyandsociety/story/0,,1344082,00.html ''Guardian Review''], November 6, 2004. On-line&lt;/ref&gt;   A similar view was stated by [[Neil Postman|Postman]], who noted the character of the ordinary citizen of the 19th century, a mind that could listen for hours on end to political orations clearly shaped by a culture favouring text. Postman warns that reading books is important for developing rational thinking and political astuteness.&lt;ref&gt;Postman, Neil (1985). ''Amusing Ourselves to Death: Public Discourse in the Age of Show Business''. NY: Penguin.&lt;/ref&gt;

Lindsay Waters, Executive Editor for the Humanities at [[Harvard University Press]], declared a worldwide reading crisis resulting from our global push toward productivity. He asserts that young children are learning to read faster, skipping phonetics and diagramming sentences, and concludes that these children will not grow up to read [[John Milton|Milton]]. He foresees the end of graduate English literature programs. "There is something similar between a reading method that focuses primarily on the bottom-line meaning of a story in a novel and the economic emphasis on the bottom line that makes automobile manufacturers speed up assembly lines." He advised re-introducing time into reading: "The mighty imperative is to speed everything up, but there might be some advantage in slowing things down. People are trying slow eating. Why not slow reading?" &lt;ref&gt;Waters, Lindsay (2007), Time for Reading, [http://chronicle.com/weekly/v53/i23/23b00601.htm ''Chronicle of Higher Education''],  53(23).

[[Carl Honoré]], an advocate of the [[Slow movement (culture)|slow movement]], discusses slow reading in his book ''In Praise of Slow''.&lt;ref&gt;Honoré, Carl (2004). [url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gb0_TtNFwPYC ''In Praise of Slow: How a Worldwide Movement is Changing the Cult of Speed'']. Vintage Canada. pages 227-229&lt;/ref&gt;  He recommends slow reading as one of several practices to decelerate from the fast pace of modern life.&lt;ref&gt;Jennings, Lane (2005). Slow Is Beautiful: Living as If Life Really Mattered. ''Futurist'', ''39''(2) (Mar/Apr 2005): p. 12-13.&lt;/ref&gt;  Laura Casey points out that the increasing availability of instant communication technologies, such as [[Text messaging|texting]] and social media like [[Facebook]] and [[Twitter]], may be contributing to the decline of slow reading.&lt;ref&gt;Casey, Laura (January 5, 2011). Is deep reading in trouble?[http://www.insidebayarea.com/argus/ci_17008403 Contra Costa Times].&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, novelist I. Alexander Olchowski founded the Slow Book Movement to advocate for reading practices related to the slow movement, including reading light material at a relaxed pace for pleasure, reading complex materials slowly for insight, reading materials of local interest and by local authors, and community building around local libraries and reading events.

== Research ==

While there is substantial research about involuntary slow reading, which can arise from a lack of fluency and is a predictor of [[dyslexia]],&lt;ref&gt;Wimmer, Heinz (1996). [https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00555368 "The Early Manifestation of Developmental [[Dyslexia]]: Evidence from German children"]. ''Reading and Writing'', 8(2).&lt;/ref&gt; there are a few studies which demonstrate the positive value of voluntary slow reading. Nell (1988) showed that there is substantial rate variability during natural reading, with most-liked pages being read significantly slower.&lt;ref&gt;Nell, V. (1988). The Psychology of Reading for Pleasure: Needs and Gratifications. ''Reading Research Quarterly'', Vol. 23, No. 1 (Winter, 1988), pp. 6-50.&lt;/ref&gt; Sherry Jr. and Schouten (2002) suggested that close reading could have commercial application as a research method for the use of poetry in marketing.&lt;ref&gt;Sherry, John F, Jr. and Schouten John W. (2002). A Role for Poetry in Consumer Research. ''Journal of Consumer Research'', 29(2), 218-234.&lt;/ref&gt;  Advocates of speed-reading point out that [[subvocalization]] slows the speed of reading,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bremer|first1=Rod|title=The Manual: A Guide to the Ultimate Study Method|publisher=Fons Sapientiae Publishing|isbn=978-0-9934964-0-0|edition=2|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cEFKjwEACAAJ&amp;dq=ultimate+study+method&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;redir_esc=y}}&lt;/ref&gt; but studies by Carver found no other observable negative effect on the reading process, and observed that the slower pace seemed to improve comprehension.&lt;ref&gt;Carver, Ronald, P. (1990). ''Reading Rate: A Review of Research and Theory''. San Diego: Academic Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''turn board''' (also known as '''turning board''') is a training device commonly used in the fields of [[Ballet]], [[dance]], [[ice skating]], and other [[Sport of athletics|athletics]] in order to aid in the development of various dance turns. It is believed that regular use of a turning board may increase confidence and comfort while performing various moves that involve turns. In dance and gymnastics, a turn is a rotation of the body about the vertical axis. It is usually a complete rotation of the body, although quarter (90°) and half (180°) turns are possible for some types of turns&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://blog.dancedirect.com/2014/10/07/turn-boards/|title=Turn Boards|website=Dance Direct Blog|access-date=2016-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.balletdocumentary.com/official-trailer/|title=FIRST POSITION – Official Trailer|website=www.balletdocumentary.com|access-date=2016-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dance.net/topic/9078803/1/Ballet-General/Turnboard-Does-It-Work.html&amp;replies=5|title=dance.net – Turnboard?

== History ==
Ballet is a type of [[performance dance]] that originated in the [[Italian Renaissance]] courts of the 15th century and later developed into a [[concert dance]] form in France and Russia. It has since become a widespread, highly technical form of dance with its own [[Glossary of ballet|vocabulary based on French terminology]]. It has been globally influential and has defined the foundational [[Ballet technique|techniques]] used in many other dance genres. Becoming a [[ballet dancer]] requires years of training. Ballet has been taught in various schools around the world, which have historically incorporated their own cultures to evolve the art.&lt;ref name="wulff"&gt;{{cite book|title=Ballet Across Borders: Career and Culture in the World of Dancers|last=Wulff|first=Helena|publisher=Berg|year=1998|isbn=1-85973-998-9|location=Oxford|page=44|authorlink=Helena Wulff}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Design ==
Turning boards come in various materials and subtle variations in design. Generally, the turn boards will be 10 – 12 inches in length, and 3-4 inches in width as it is a platform for a foot. Turn boards have an arched shape to reduce the boards touchpoint on the ground, and to allow for turning flat footed. Thus causing less friction and more ease of spinning. Generally, the boards are made of wood or a plastic composite that has a friction reducing component, and come in a variety of colors and features.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sprocketworks.com/how-a-ballet-board-works/|title=How A Ballet Board Works – Sprocket Works|website=www.sprocketworks.com|access-date=2016-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Functionality ==
Turning boards normally function through proper application of the law of physics by reducing friction and increasing the ease of spinning.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.lexingtonballet.org/performances_videos.html|title=Lexington Ballet – Ticket and Performances|website=www.lexingtonballet.org|access-date=2016-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The user will commonly stand on the turning board with one foot and attempt to rotate the body in an effort to become familiar with the motion of turning and the functions of a dance turn. This increased ease of turning due to the reduced friction, in effect, allows the dancer to focus on other functions of the turn such as spotting, balance, and muscle memory.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; The turn boards are best used on Marley, wood, or tile floors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/first-muslim-hijabi-ballerina_us_56b20645e4b08069c7a58991|title=Meet The Girl Who Dreams Of Becoming The First Muslim Hijabi Ballerina|date=2016-02-03|website=The Huffington Post|access-date=2016-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=KBMTALENT|title=How to do a a la second turn|date=2012-01-18|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxjRM9XflZs|accessdate=2016-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Users ==
Turning boards are mainly used by ballet dancers and ice skaters in order to aid the process dance turns. However, turning boards are also used by other types of dancers (jazz dance, tap dance, hip-hop dance, etc.) as well as gymnast and other athletes looking for work on the sensation of multiple turns. Its more commonly used for aspiring dancers still mastering their craft.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

The '''University Teachers Union''' (大学教員組合 – ''Daigaku Kyouin Kumiai'') was founded in January 1999 and represents the interests of tertiary-level teachers in the [[Kantō region|Kanto region]] of [[Japan]]. Membership is open to any teacher, regardless of nationality, who is employed at a university, college, or post-graduate institution in a non-management post. Under [[Trade Union Act of 1949|Japanese Trade Union Law]],&lt;ref&gt;The Japan Institute for Labour Policy and Training. [http://www.jil.go.jp/english/laborinfo/library/Laws.htm Labor Union Act (latest revision: 2005).] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110525093504/http://www.jil.go.jp/english/laborinfo/library/Laws.htm |date=2011-05-25 }} Retrieved 27 May 2011&lt;/ref&gt; the University Teachers Union has the right to conduct [[collective bargaining]] with schools on behalf of its members. While negotiations with [[management]] are conducted in Japanese, internal business is mostly conducted in English.

== Affiliations ==
Although the University Teachers Union (UTU) describes itself as a [[Trade union|union]], it is in fact a branch of the National Union of General Workers Tokyo Nambu (全国一般労働組合東京南部 – ''Zenkoku Ippan Roudou Kumiai Tokyo Nambu''),&lt;ref&gt;National Union of General Workers Tokyo Nambu, [http://nugwnambu.org/ nugwnambu.org] Retrieved 27 May 2011&lt;/ref&gt; a trade union usually referred to as NUGW Tokyo Nambu or just ''Nambu''. Nambu is a member of the NUGW National Council ([[:ja:全国一般労働組合全国協議会|全国一般労働組合全国協議会]] ''Zenkoku Ippan Roudou Kumiai Zenkoku Kyogikai''), a national [[Umbrella group|umbrella organization]] for 39 trade unions,&lt;ref&gt;NUGW National Council (''National Union of General Workers''). [http://nugw.kir.jp/guide/kameiitiran.html Affiliated unions.] Retrieved 7 June 2011&lt;/ref&gt; commonly known in English by its shortened title: the [[National Union of General Workers]]. NUGW National Council is in turn affiliated to National Trade Union Council (全国労働組合連絡協議会 – ''Zenrokyo''),&lt;ref&gt;National Trade Union Council (''[[Zenrokyo]]''). [http://www.zenrokyo.org/kamei.htm Affiliated unions.] Retrieved 7 June 2011&lt;/ref&gt; the smallest of the three [[Labor_unions_in_Japan#National_labor_union_federations|national labour federations]] in Japan.

Within the NUGW National Council, UTU works closely with two of Nambu's sister unions which have a high proportion of foreign members: the [[General Union]] and the Fukuoka General Union.&lt;ref&gt;Fukuoka General Union [http://fukuoka.generalunion.org/ fukuoka.generalunion.org] Retrieved 27 May 2011&lt;/ref&gt; UTU also works closely with the Union of Part-Time Lecturers (非常勤講師組合 – ''Hijoukin Koushi Kumiai''), a union established in 1996, with roughly 200 members.&lt;ref&gt;Union of University Part-time Lecturers, [http://f47.aaa.livedoor.jp/~hijokin/KT02.html/ f47.aaa.livedoor.jp/~hijokin/KT02/] Retrieved 27 May 2011&lt;/ref&gt; The Union of Part-Time Lecturers is affiliated to the second largest labour federation, the National Confederation of Trade Unions (全国労働組合総連合 – ''Zenroren''),&lt;ref&gt;National Confederation of Trade Unions [http://www.zenroren.gr.jp/ www.zenroren.gr.jp] Retrieved 27 May 2011&lt;/ref&gt; and conducts its business in Japanese.

== Aims ==
As a labour organization, UTU works towards the improvement and maintenance of working conditions, the improvement of the general working environment and employee welfare, and cooperation with other organizations that have similar objectives.
UTU’s policies aim to realize:
* The creation of working environments in which professionalism and quality education are promoted
* A level of job security and stability which allows instructors to concentrate more on students' needs and research and less on issues of personal welfare
* The elimination of discrimination based on race, age, gender, sexual orientation or national origin
* The elimination of discrimination between different fields of education (such as that between lecture and so-called 'skills' classes).&lt;ref&gt;University Teachers Union. [http://nugw.org/utu/3-Aims.shtml Aims.] Retrieved 27 May 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

== Surveys ==
In 2004, UTU carried out a Survey of Foreign Nationals at Japanese Universities. The survey was compiled and published in collaboration with the Tokyo area Union of Part-Time Lecturers.

The concerns used to formulate the survey were:
* The lack of equivalent contracts for Japanese and foreign workers.
* That foreigners’ contributions to education in Japan and their academic achievements were not being acknowledged.
* That difficulties facing foreigners in language, residence and visa administration were not being understood and properly taken into account by the universities.
* That foreigners and Japanese were not receiving the same benefits from the national pension system.
 
Questions concerned, among other issues: tenure and contracts, visa status, health insurance and pension, unemployment insurance, language, and housing. Analysis of responses from 330 foreign university instructors showed discriminatory treatment by universities in many of these matters.&lt;ref&gt;Eric Johnston (8 Dec 2004) [http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/nn20041208f1.html Limited-term foreign professors seen cornering workload but not benefits.] The Japan Times. Retrieved 22 June 2011&lt;/ref&gt; The Survey Report was submitted to the [[Ministry of Education (Japan)|Ministry of Education]], the [[Japanese Ministry of Labour|Ministry of Labour and Welfare]], and the [[Ministry of Justice (Japan)|Ministry of Justice]] at a meeting with lawmakers and officials on 8 March 2005.&lt;ref&gt;The Union of Part-time Lecturers in Tokyo Area.

UTU also contributed to a 2005 national survey of the conditions of part-time university lecturers, in conjunction with the Union of Part-Time Lecturers Kansai, Union of Part-Time Lecturers Tokyo Area, [[General Union]], and Fukuoka General Union.&lt;ref&gt;University Part-time Lecturers Union Kansai.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2495">The '''Vladimir Ilich Lenin Higher Party School''' ({{lang-sq|Shkolla e Lartë e Partisë “V.I. Lenin”}}) was a university-level education institution that existed in [[Socialist People's Republic of Albania|Albania]] during the period of [[Communist]] rule.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=eKswXpDWBGgC&amp;pg=PA149&amp;lpg=PA149&amp;dq=Lenin+Higher+Party+School+Albania&amp;source=web&amp;ots=dUV-5O-9tk&amp;sig=ipVgqWKUU-XgC9SConTaNEj6PSo&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ct=result "Women, State, and Party in Eastern Europe"]&lt;/ref&gt; It was founded on August 11, 1945 and closed in 1991. The school was accessible to all who had finished high school education. Many of the students were already graduates in other fields in other institutions of higher education in Albania. The one criterion for admission was loyalty to the Party. The studies lasted two years, without having to face exams or other academic testing, nor a final thesis or exam whatsoever. All the classes were about [[Marxist-Leninist]] indoctrination, [[Albanian Party of Labor|Communist Party]] history and similar.

The last Director (Rector, Chancellor) of the School was [[Nexhmije Hoxha]], the widow of [[Enver Hoxha]], the dictator of Albania from 1944 until 1985, his death. Nexhmije herself was without a formal higher education. Previous directors included [[Fiqrete Shehu]], the wife of long-time prime minister [[Mehmet Shehu]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://files.osa.ceu.hu/holdings/300/8/3/text/3-12-78.shtml "Recent Developments On The Albanian Scene"], Louis Zanga, 29 June 1982.&lt;/ref&gt;

Students were given a two-year scholarship (the duration of the studies) of 800 [[Albanian lek]] per month. This was twice the salary of a factory worker and thrice the salary of a peasant worker. For the duration of their studies, the students were given free student housing for themselves and family. The whole purpose of the existence of the school was to provide academic credentials for Party faithfuls who would otherwise be ineligible for positions requiring higher education.

:: ''This article is about the American organization providing teaching fellowships established in 1945. For the American international relations organization established in 1921, see [[Woodrow Wilson Foundation]].''

The '''Woodrow Wilson National Fellowship Foundation'''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.postgraduatefunding.com/provider-890|title=Woodrow Wilson National Fellowship Foundation, on PostgraduteFunding.com|website=www.PostgraduateFunding.com|language=en|access-date=2018-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a private [[non-profit]] operating [[Foundation (charity)|foundation]] based in [[Princeton, New Jersey|Princeton]], [[New Jersey]]. It administers programs that support leadership development and build organizational capacity in education. Its current signature program is the Woodrow Wilson Teaching Fellowship. Fellowships are granted to develop human resources, improve public policy, and help different organizations and institutions in enhancing practice in the United States as well as other countries worldwide.

== History ==

=== Early years (1945–1957) ===
The first '''Woodrow Wilson Fellowships''' were created by Dr. Whitney "Mike" Oates, a [[Princeton University]] classics professor who served in the Marine Corps during World War II. During his tour of duty, Professor Oates realized that many of his brightest undergraduates who had served in the armed forces were unlikely to go on to doctoral study and college teaching careers when the war was over. As the [[G.I. Bill]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://benefits.va.gov/gibill/|title=Education and Training Home|last=223D|website=benefits.va.gov|access-date=2018-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; took shape, however, it was clear that college enrollments would expand, and the ranks of qualified college instructors must grow.

Oates and the Princeton graduate dean, Sir Hugh Taylor,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1974/04/18/archives/sir-hugh-taylor-princeton-dean-physical-chemist-exhead-of-graduate.html|title=Sir Hugh Taylor, Princeton Dean|last=Baker|first=Russell|date=1974-04-18|work=The New York Times|access-date=2018-05-22|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; developed a program of fellowships funded by various individual donors to help recruit veterans to Princeton's Ph.D. programs in the humanities. In 1945, these fellowships were combined into one program and named for [[Woodrow Wilson]], a champion of teaching and of graduate studies during his tenure as president of Princeton. The Woodrow Wilson Fellowships provided full funding for Ph.D. studies, with the proviso that recipients plan a career in college teaching.

Other universities and national funders began to recognize the importance of recruiting future college professors. In 1947, [[Carnegie Corporation of New York]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.carnegie.org/|title=Carnegie Corporation of New York|last=York|first=Carnegie Corporation of New|website=Carnegie Corporation of New York|language=en|access-date=2018-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; provided $100,000 to expand the program to selected universities nationwide. Gradually the program broadened to extend eligibility beyond veterans, in fields other than the humanities. In 1951 the Fellowship program was placed under the administration of the Association of Graduate Schools. In the same year, the first women were granted Woodrow Wilson Fellowships.

In 1953 [[Robert F. Goheen]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.princeton.edu/pr/pwb/08/0407/goheen/|title=Robert F. Goheen: 16th president of Princeton dies at 88 - 4/7/2008 - Princeton Weekly Bulletin|website=www.princeton.edu|access-date=2018-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; who had been one of the first four Woodrow Wilson Fellows in 1945, became national director of the Woodrow Wilson National Fellowship Program, expanding the program to 200 fellowships nationally.  Over the next several years, other funders, including the [[Rockefeller Foundation]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.rockefellerfoundation.org/|title=Home - The Rockefeller Foundation|website=The Rockefeller Foundation|language=en-US|access-date=2018-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; also supported the program.

=== The national Woodrow Wilson Fellowship (1957–1974) ===
In 1957, the [[Ford Foundation]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.fordfoundation.org/|title=Home|website=Ford Foundation|language=en|access-date=2018-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; provided a five-year, $24.5 million grant to support up to 1,000 Woodrow Wilson Fellowships annually, and the Woodrow Wilson National Fellowship Foundation was independently incorporated.  Fellowships were offered across the range of arts and sciences. Overall, during the following decade—including two renewal grants, in 1962 and 1966—the Fellowships received $52 million in Ford Foundation support, providing both awards to Fellows and supplemental support to the graduate schools hosting them.

Throughout these years, a rigorous interview process was the hallmark of the Woodrow Wilson Fellowship. Professors nominated or recommended promising seniors, and applications underwent review at the Foundation, with finalists examined by regional panels on campuses around the country. A 1960 TIME magazine article proclaimed, "The Woodrow Wilson Fellowship is fast becoming a domestic version of the Rhodes Scholarship."&lt;ref name="Time"&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,894799,00.html "Education: Search for Professors"] (March 21, 1960), ''TIME Magazine.''&lt;/ref&gt;

Foundation policies stipulated that candidates could not hold both the Woodrow Wilson Fellowship and other, similar fellowships for doctoral study. Some candidates, after successfully completing the intensive interviews, declined the Woodrow Wilson Fellowships to accept [[Rhodes Scholarships]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.stampsfoundation.org/2016/09/12/rhodes-scholarship/|title=Rhodes Scholarship {{!}} Stamps Family Charitable Foundation|website=www.stampsfoundation.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[National Science Foundation]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nsf.gov/|title=NSF - National Science Foundation|website=www.nsf.gov|language=en|access-date=2018-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; fellowships, and other such awards. These candidates were allowed designation as honorary Woodrow Wilson Fellows.

In addition to the full Woodrow Wilson Fellowships, various complementary awards were offered during the 1960s and early 1970s. These included Woodrow Wilson Dissertation Fellowships, offered to supplement the original award for Fellows who required dissertation support; Teaching and Administrative Internships, designed to engage graduate students and young administrators with the nation's [[historically black colleges and universities]]; and Martin Luther King, Jr. Fellowships, specifically intended for African American veterans of the armed forces. The mix of a signature fellowship with complementary programs to create access and capacity in the nation's education system became a pattern for later Woodrow Wilson Foundation activities.

By the early 1970s full funding for the Woodrow Wilson Fellowships had diminished, and, over the concluding several years of the program, the Foundation reduced both the number and amount of awards. By the time the original Woodrow Wilson Fellowship program ended, nearly 18,000 Fellows had been named. Woodrow Wilson Fellows went on to receive 13 [[Nobel Prizes]], 35 [[MacArthur Fellows Program|MacArthur]] "genius grants," 11 [[Pulitzer Prizes]], 21 Presidential Medals, and many other awards.

=== Other higher education fellowships at Woodrow Wilson (1974-present) ===
As the original large-scale Woodrow Wilson Fellowships came to an end, the Foundation still sought to provide opportunity in higher education for specific groups of students. Following a precedent set by some of the Foundation's earlier supplementary fellowships, the Woodrow Wilson Dissertation Fellowship in Women's Studies, created in 1974, not only bolstered the growth of feminist scholarship across the humanities and social sciences, but also supported primarily women scholars completing Ph.D.s in these fields at a time when women were significantly underrepresented in doctoral study.

In the 1980s and 1990s the Woodrow Wilson Foundation continued to encourage work in targeted academic disciplines. The Charlotte W. Newcombe Doctoral Dissertation Fellowship, funded by the Charlotte W. Newcombe Foundation, still supports completion of Ph.D. work on ethical or religious values in any field of the humanities or social sciences. Other Woodrow Wilson programs created during the 1980s and 1990s to strengthen specific academic fields included the Andrew W. Mellon Fellowship in the Humanities (1982–2006) and the Spencer Dissertation Fellowships in Education (1987–1992).

During the same period, the Foundation also established fellowships in higher education  to encourage preparation for specific national high-need fields such as women's health.

From time to time Woodrow Wilson fellowships have also provided support for individuals at particular stages of their careers in higher education, such as the Millicent McIntosh Fellowships for Recently Tenured Faculty and the Woodrow Wilson Academic Postdoctoral Fellowships in the Humanities.

=== Professional development for teachers (1974-present) ===
During the years after the original Woodrow Wilson Fellowships, the Foundation also launched various programs to cultivate and support teachers at the middle- and high-school levels, as well as in college. The earliest of these was the Woodrow Wilson Teacher Fellowship (1974–1981). Though limited in scope, serving just 42 teachers, it paved the way for the subsequent Leadership Program for Teachers (1982–2003), which brought more than 2,400 teachers into summer enrichment programs with university faculty. The related  Woodrow Wilson National Network of Seminars for Teachers, begun in 1999 as Teachers as Scholars, also offers professional development, bringing teachers back to university campuses for intensive seminars in their disciplines with leading arts and sciences faculty. These programs would serve as precursors to the more recent Woodrow Wilson Teaching Fellowship.

=== Organizational capacity in K-12 and higher education (1974-present) ===
Some of the earliest work of the initial Woodrow Wilson Fellowships required building new networks and capacities in higher education. Subsequent programs made this focus on organizational capacity more explicit.

In the 1970s, the Rockefeller Foundation and other funders supported a program of Woodrow Wilson Teaching and Administrative Internships that brought graduate students to historically black colleges and universities, seeking both to strengthen HBCUs' faculty and to provide these young scholars and leaders with campus-based experience.

A separate program of the same era, the Woodrow Wilson Visiting Fellows, created a "speakers bureau" that brought national leaders in for week-long residencies on small campuses at a distance from major metropolitan areas, working one-on-one and in small groups with students and faculty. The Council of Independent Colleges now manages this ongoing program.

During the 1990s, troubled by the apparent and growing mismatch between liberal arts doctoral education and the academic and nonacademic job markets, the Foundation created a suite of programs that included the Humanities at Work and the Responsive Ph.D. The former sought both to widen potential nonacademic employers' understanding of the skills offered by individuals with doctoral-level humanities backgrounds and, within the academy, to encourage both graduate students' and faculty's appreciation for the role of the humanities in a larger socioeconomic context. The related Responsive Ph.D. initiative created a network of institutions committed to rethinking graduate education in a way that aligned doctoral graduates' preparation more fully with the academic careers awaiting them.

As in its individual work with K-12 teachers, the Foundation also, in the early 2000s, turned its attention to building networks and capacity among high schools. Through the Woodrow Wilson Early College Initiative, supported by the [[Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation]], the Foundation drew on its higher education networks to create small middle and high schools through a series of school-university partnerships. These schools—part of a national Early College network serving high-need, low-income students—created models for preparing all students in a school to attend and graduate college. The WW Early College strategy includes dual enrollment, academic rigor, practical skills coaching, and on-campus experience.

==Current activities==

=== The Woodrow Wilson Teaching Fellowships (2007–present) ===
In 2007, under the new leadership of Arthur Levine, the board and staff of the Woodrow Wilson Foundation reassessed the organization's connection to national needs in education. The Foundation concluded that the [[achievement gap]] was perhaps the nation's most urgent education need, not only at the K-12 level but also for institutions of higher education, which are dependent on college-ready students, and for society at large, which requires a well-educated, sophisticated workforce drawn from all socioeconomic backgrounds.

Based on numerous studies indicating that the presence of a well-prepared teacher is the single most important factor in student achievement, the Foundation created the Woodrow Wilson Teaching Fellowship to serve as its signature program for the near- to mid-term. The Woodrow Wilson Teaching Fellowship is intended to recruit exceptionally well-qualified individuals into teaching in high-need urban and rural secondary schools, as well as to transform the way in which they are prepared to teach.

The WW Teaching Fellowship was launched in 2007 in two versions.&lt;ref name="NYT"&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/20/education/20teaching.html "Foundation Hopes to Lure Top Students to Teaching"] (December 20, 2007), ''The New York Times.''&lt;/ref&gt; One version funded by the [[Annenberg Foundation]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.annenberg.org/|title=Annenberg Foundation|website=Annenberg Foundation|language=en|access-date=2018-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Leonore Annenberg Teaching Fellowship, was implemented at four selected national universities—[[Stanford University]] and the Universities of [[University of Pennsylvania|Pennsylvania]], [[University of Virginia|Virginia]], and [[University of Washington|Washington]]—that showcase excellence in teacher preparation. In the other, state-based model, Fellows enroll in an intensive master's-level teacher preparation program at one of a designated group of universities. The universities, in exchange for receiving exceptional teacher candidates and a matching grant, agree to rethink their teacher preparation programs, emphasizing classroom experience from the early phases of the program. A third related program, the Woodrow Wilson-Rockefeller Brothers Fund Fellowship for Aspiring Teachers of Color, was transferred to the Woodrow Wilson Foundation in 2009 by the [[Rockefeller Brothers Fund]]. Fellows across all three programs receive $30,000 stipends and enroll in teacher preparation programs designated by the Woodrow Wilson Foundation.

The state-based model of the WW Teaching Fellowship was first implemented as the Woodrow Wilson Indiana Teaching Fellowship in December 2007 with the support of Lilly Endowment&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Lilly Endowment|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/springerreference_76109|journal=SpringerReference|location=Berlin/Heidelberg|publisher=Springer-Verlag}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Indiana Governor [[Mitch Daniels]]. Two additional states, Michigan and Ohio, signed on in late 2009 and 2010, creating, respectively, the W.K. Kellogg Foundation's  Woodrow Wilson Michigan Teaching Fellowship, endorsed by Michigan Governor [[Jennifer Granholm]], and the Woodrow Wilson Ohio Teaching Fellowship,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://sites.jcu.edu/woodrowwilson/|title=Home|website=sites.jcu.edu|language=en-US|access-date=2018-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; endorsed by Ohio Governor [[Ted Strickland]] and supported by the Ohio Board of Regents' Choose Ohio First program, with additional funds from a statewide group of private philanthropies. The Indiana, Michigan, and Ohio programs all focus specifically on teacher preparation in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics, also known as the STEM fields.

The first group of Woodrow Wilson Indiana Teaching Fellows completed the first phase of their work in summer 2010. The Michigan and Ohio programs will name their first classes in 2011. Other states are in discussion about creating similar programs. President [[Barack Obama]] cited the Woodrow Wilson Teaching Fellowship as a model of STEM teacher preparation&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://cen.acs.org/articles/88/i4/Educate-Innovate.html|title=Educate To Innovate {{!}} January 25, 2010 Issue - Vol. 88 Issue 4 {{!}} Chemical &amp; Engineering News|last=Morrissey|first=Susan R.|website=cen.acs.org|access-date=2018-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; in a January 2010 speech focused on his administration's Educate to Innovate initiative.

=== Ongoing higher education fellowships ===
In addition to its teacher preparation activities, the Woodrow Wilson Foundation continues to offer a suite of fellowships that prepare emerging scholars and leaders for success in the American academy and in several high-need fields. These include the Woodrow Wilson Dissertation Fellowship in Women's Studies, the Charlotte W. Newcombe Doctoral Dissertation Fellowship, and others. Funds for general studies beyond the scope of these programs are not available from the Woodrow Wilson Foundation.

=== Schools and college readiness ===
The Foundation also continues its capacity-building work in high schools, building on expertise developed with the Woodrow Wilson Early Colleges. Seventeen schools currently exist in the formal Woodrow Wilson Early College network, with another half-dozen schools and districts partnering with Woodrow Wilson to implement the approach in various ways.

==Woodrow Wilson Foundation Leadership==
The president of the Woodrow Wilson National Fellowship Foundation is Arthur Levine, former president of Teachers College, Columbia University. The 35-member Woodrow Wilson Board of Trustees is chaired by Walter W. Buckley, Jr., co-founder and president of Buckley Muething Capital Management. Incorporated as a 501(c)3 nonprofit organization, the Woodrow Wilson Foundation is an operating foundation supported by a range of public and private funders.
