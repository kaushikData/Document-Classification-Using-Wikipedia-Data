In [[economics]], '''affine pricing''' is a situation where buying more than zero of a good gains a fixed benefit or cost, and each purchase after that gains a per-unit benefit or cost.

Denoting
''T'' is the total price paid,
''q'' is the quantity in units purchased, 
''p'' is a constant price per unit, 
''k'' is the fixed cost,

the affine price is then calculated by &lt;math&gt;T=p*q + k&lt;/math&gt;

In mathematical language, the price is an [[affine function]] (sometimes also [[linear function]]) of the quantity bought.

An example would be a cell phone contract where a base price is paid each month with a per-minute price for calls. 

Sliding-scale price contracts achieve a similar effect, although the terms are stated differently.  The price decreases with volume produced, achieving the same financial transfer over time, but the transaction is always based on units sold, with the fixed cost amortized into the price of each unit.

In [[optics]] an '''afocal system''' (a system without focus) is an optical system that produces no net convergence or divergence of the beam, i.e. has an infinite [[effective focal length]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=4nxMduNT8-gC&amp;pg=PA379&amp;dq=afocal&amp;lr=&amp;cd=14#v=onepage&amp;q=afocal&amp;f=false Daniel Malacara, Zacarias Malacara, Handbook of optical design. Page 379]&lt;/ref&gt; This type of system can be created with a pair of optical elements where the distance between the elements is equal to the sum of each element's [[focal length]] (''d'' = ''f''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;+''f''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;). A simple example of an afocal optical system is an [[optical telescope]] imaging a star, the light entering the system is at infinity and the image it forms is at infinity (the light is [[collimated]]).&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=Jg1JW4kWD1UC&amp;pg=PA38&amp;dq=afocal++without+focus&amp;lr=&amp;cd=5#v=onepage&amp;q=afocal%20%20without%20focus&amp;f=false Virendra N. Mahajan, Ray geometrical optics, page 38]&lt;/ref&gt; Although the system does not alter the divergence of a collimated beam, it does alter the width of the beam, increasing [[magnification]]. The magnification of such a telescope is given by

:&lt;math&gt;M = \frac{f_2}{f_1},&lt;/math&gt;

Afocal systems are used in laser optics, for instance as [[beam expander]]s, [[Infrared]] and [[forward looking infrared]] systems, camera [[zoom lens]]es and telescopic lens attachments such as [[teleside converter]]s,&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=hcq_40I_7egC&amp;pg=PA190&amp;dq=early+afocal+photography&amp;lr=&amp;cd=12#v=onepage&amp;q=afocal&amp;f=false Rudolf Kingslake, Optics in photography, page 187]&lt;/ref&gt; and photography setups combining cameras and telescopes ([[Afocal photography]]).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="27562">The '''BBVA Foundation Frontiers of Knowledge Awards''', ''Premios Fundación BBVA Fronteras del Conocimiento'', in Spanish, are an international award programme recognizing significant contributions in the areas of scientific research and cultural creation. The categories that make up the Frontiers of Knowledge Awards respond to the knowledge map of the present age. As well as the fundamental knowledge that is at their core, they address developments in information and communication technologies, and interactions between biology and medicine, ecology and conservation biology, climate change, economics, development cooperation and, finally, contemporary musical creation and performance. Specific categories are reserved for developing knowledge fields of critical relevance, as in the case of the two environmental awards. Accolades in the environment area and development cooperation, two central challenges of the 21st century, may go to either research or practical actions and programs founded on the best available knowledge.

The awards were established in 2008, with the first set of winners receiving their prizes in 2009. [[The BBVA Foundation]] – belonging to financial group [[BBVA]] – is partnered in the scheme by the Spanish National Research Council (CSIC), the country’s premier public research organization.

In their eight editions, as many as four winners of BBVA Foundation Frontiers of Knowledge Awards have gone on to win the Nobel Prize. They are: Robert J. Lefkowitz, 2009 BBVA Foundation Frontiers of Knowledge Laureate in Biomedicine and winner of the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 2012; Shinya Yamanaka, 2010 BBVA Foundation Frontiers of Knowledge Laureate in Biomedicine and Nobel Laureate in Physiology or Medicine 2012; Lars Peter Hansen, 2010 BBVA Foundation Frontiers of Knowledge Laureate in Economics, Finance and Management, and 2013 Nobel Laureate in Economics; Jean Tirole, 2008 BBVA Foundation Frontiers of Knowledge Laureate in Economics, Finance and Management and winner of the Nobel Prize in Economics 2014, and Angus Deaton, 2011 BBVA Foundation Frontiers of Knowledge Laureate in Economics, Finance and Management and winner of the Nobel Prize in Economics 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Fronteras del Conocimiento pone el énfasis en la ciencia y la cultura|url=http://sociedad.elpais.com/sociedad/2014/06/17/actualidad/1403032791_161492.html|publisher=El País (Grupo PRISA)|date=June 17, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=La fiesta del conocimiento|url=http://sociedad.elpais.com/sociedad/2009/06/18/actualidad/1245276015_850215.html|accessdate=2 February 2015|publisher=El País (Grupo PRISA)|date=June 18, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=La frontera sin fin|url=http://www.elmundo.es/economia/2014/06/24/53a94448ca47419c2e8b4573.html|accessdate=2 February 2015|publisher=El Mundo (Unidad Editorial)|date=June 24, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''COSI''' (an acronym for '''C'''enter '''o'''f '''S'''cience and '''I'''ndustry) is a [[science museum]] and [[research center]] located in [[Columbus, Ohio]] in the [[United States]]. Originally opened in 1964, COSI was relocated to a 320,000 square foot state-of-the-art facility designed by Japanese architect [[Arata Isozaki]] along a bend in the [[Scioto River]] in the [[Franklinton, Columbus, Ohio|Franklinton]] neighborhood in 1999. COSI features more than 300 interactive exhibits throughout themed exhibition areas.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cosi.org/about-cosi|title=About COSI}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a “center of science and industry” (rather than a standalone “science center”),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cosi.org/downloads/about/center-of-science.pdf|title=COSI's Center of Science Model}}&lt;/ref&gt; COSI established embedded partnerships with local organizations. [[WOSU-FM|WOSU]]@COSI (Central Ohio’s [[NPR]] member station and [[Public Broadcasting Service]] public media station) maintains a digital media center and offices; [[Ohio State University|OSU]] maintains a center of research as well as health &amp; medicine laboratories staffed by medical residents; and Columbus Historical Society maintains offices and exhibit space.

COSI also operates the largest outreach education program of any science museum in the United States through COSI in the Classroom, 21st Century Lab field trip experiences, international [[distance education]] Interactive Video Conferencing programs, and COSI On Wheels traveling outreach program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cosi.org/educators|title=COSI - For Educators}}&lt;/ref&gt; As well, COSI originated the Camp-In overnight program for [[Girl Scouts of the USA|Girl Scouts]] and [[Boy Scouts of America|Boy Scouts]] in 1972 – a concept that is now commonplace in museums nationwide. Since 1964, COSI has engaged with nearly 30 million unique visitors through on-site and outreach programs.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;

As a [[not-for-profit organization]], COSI is supported by ticket sales, a network of community and statewide partnerships (including relationships with a variety of donors and sponsors), a volunteer program supported by 10,000 volunteers annually, and nearly 20,000 member households.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cosi.org/volunteer-employment|title=Volunteer &amp; Employment}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, COSI was the named the #1 science center in the United States for families by Parent Magazine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.parents.com/fun/vacation/us-destinations/best-science-centers/|title=Parents Magazine - 10 Best Science CentersI}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mission statement==
[[Image:AUT 0344.JPG|thumb|The museum's [[Foucault pendulum]], located at the facility's west entrance.]]
''As adopted in 1964...'' "COSI provides an exciting and informative atmosphere for those of all ages to discover more about our environment, our accomplishments, our heritage, and ourselves. We motivate a desire toward a better understanding of science, industry, health, and history through involvement in exhibits, demonstrations, and a variety of educational activities and experiences. COSI is for the enrichment of the individual and for a more rewarding life on our planet, Earth."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cosi.org/about-cosi/|title=COSI - Mission Statement}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Exhibit areas==
Upon relocating to its new home in 1999, COSI was developed with large, self-contained, [[theming|themed]] atria, each dedicated to a single topic (similar to the style of [[world’s fair]] pavilions) and designed as immersive theatrical “learning worlds.” As of 2018, COSI contains seven main exhibit areas: Ocean, Energy Explorers, Space, Progress, Gadgets, Life, and the American Museum of National History Dinosaur Gallery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cosi.org/exhibits|title=COSI - Exhibits &amp; Live Shows}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hallways between each learning world are filled with hands-on exhibits and displays.

===Ocean===
The Ocean exhibit is divided into two realms. Accessed via an “underwater cave” through a crashed shipwreck, the cavern path splits as guests pass to the right or left. The pathway to the right leads to a docked [[submarine]] laboratory where hands-on exhibits explore the realities of ocean research, submersibles, SCUBA, water pressure, and remote-operated vehicles. Lilypad Lab focuses on [[drainage basin]] and Central Ohio wildlife. The path forking left from the shipwreck leads to the Temple of Poseidon, an “ancient” stone chamber built around a 30-foot tall statue of [[Poseidon]] with waterfalls, fountains, and water jets. This second realm focuses not on the study of water, but on the properties of water and the stories it inspires – [[laminar flow]], whirlpools, erosion, water bells, and mythology.

===Energy Explorers===
Energy Explorers, which opened in 2013, allows visitors to choose an [[avatar|avatar (computing)]] character that follows the guest to the Home Zone, Transportation Zone, and Product Zone of a town, making decisions via computer kiosks to balance energy efficiency and cost.

===Space===
The Space exhibit area features a replica space station pod to tour, a recreation of [[John Glenn]]'s Friendship 7 spacecraft from the [[Mercury-Atlas 6]], remote-operated vehicles, balance tests, and other hands-on experiments that deal with space flight trajectory, gravitational pull, and simulated rover landings. Space was originally located on Level 2 in its own enclosed atrium exhibit area, entered via a "black hole" spinning funhouse hallway meant to disorient guests. The exhibit itself - like Ocean or Adventure - was in a dark, immersive, themed area, stylized after the 1969 moon landing of [[Apollo 11]]. Under starry skies, guests interacted with "retro" stylized monitors and exhibits with a matching wood-panel / brushed metal motif that was reminiscent of the era and united in style. The exhibit even included a 1960s living room (including shag carpeting) where guests could watch the recorded landing.

When the south end of COSI's building was closed due to lost levies in 2004, the Space exhibit was cut off. As such, it was relocated from Level 2 to an empty gallery on Level 1. In 2012, that area underwent construction to become Energy Explorers, necessitating yet another location switch. Some of the Space exhibit's displays moved to the Mezzanine Level while much remained in storage. With the re-opening of COSI's '''Planetarium''' in November 2014, the location of Space on the Mezzanine leading toward the Planetarium's lobby was reinforced by the return and refurbishment of the rest of Space's exhibits. However, Space still remains the only one of COSI's seven learning worlds to not have its own dedicated, theatrical, immersive atrium, instead being located on the bright Mezzanine bridge, open to the Atrium and entryway. The original home of Space is now Gallery 3, available for traveling exhibits and special event rentals. Gallery 3 still contains the ''Galaxy Theater,'' fittingly still painted with murals of planets and stars left over from its time as a live theater for Space.

===Progress===
The Progress exhibit (modeled after the “Streets of Yesteryear” exhibit at COSI’s original location) traces the hopes and fears of a small town called Progress in 1898, just as electricity, horseless carriages, and canned food become available. The recreated town (specifically, the shops, homes, and restaurants at the corner of Hope Street and Fear Street) includes a telegraph office, livery, stable, grocer, apothecary, and clothiers. After visitors walk through Progress in 1898, they turn the corner enter the same intersection of the same town 64 years later in 1962, where a new set of hopes and fears have arisen.

In 1962, the town of Progress includes an appliance store, working TV studio, radio station (where the telegraph office was), department store, diner, and gas station (replacing the livery). At the exit, the exhibit challenges guests to consider how the streets of the village of Progress might look today, and to question why the concept of [[progress (history)|progress]] deserves as much weight in scientific study as that of oceans, space, or energy.

===Gadgets===
The Gadgets exhibit area contains many classic science museum hands-on experiments, such as [[pulleys]], wind tunnels, [[plasmaglobes]], magnets, light bulbs, engines, and counterweights. As well, Gadgets contains the ‘Gadgets Café’, where families are seated and given a “menu” with quick science experiments to choose from. A “take-apart” menu allows visitors to disassemble donated phones, computers, clocks, and other electronic devices, which are recycled afterward.

===Life===
Life explores humanity through three separate areas dedicated to mind, body, and spirit. The ''Mind'' area contains optical illusions, physical illusions, an [[anechoic chamber]], and a posable [[zoetrope]]. ''Spirit'' discusses the concept of birth and death and how human cultures understand them. ''Body'' features interactive health stations where visitors can record their weight, flexibility, and heart rate, then compare their statistics to that of COSI visitors and national averages. Life also contains the ''Labs in Life'', three working medical research pods staffed by [[Ohio State University|OSU]] Health &amp; Medicine students and staff.[[File:Main COSI Columbus Sign 1.jpg|thumb|right]]

=== Dinosaur Gallery ===
On November 19 of 2017, COSI, in partnership with the [[American Museum of Natural History]], opened a permanent Dinosaur Gallery. In addition, a traveling special exhibition gallery opened in Spring of 2018. Together, they will occupy 22,000 square feet on the first floor.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.dispatch.com/content/stories/local/2016/09/16/dinosaur-exhibit-at-cosi.html|title=Columbus Dispatch|last=Gordon|first=Ken|date=September 16, 2016|work=|access-date=December 11, 2017|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other features===
The building also contains an interactive '''“little kidspace”''' area designed for children up through first grade, the '''National Geographic Giant Screen Theater''' (the largest digital screen in Ohio), and an outdoor '''Big Science Park'''. On November 22, 2014, COSI reopened its 60-foot diameter, 220-seat '''[[Planetarium]]''' (Ohio’s largest) with all new digital projection. In addition, there is a '''History of COSI''' exhibit.

The building also includes three large '''Galleries''' for traveling exhibits and special event hosting, a Dive Theater in Ocean, the Galaxy Theater in Gallery 3 (its name a remnant of when Gallery 3 was once the Space exhibit), the Gadgets Stage, the Atomic Cafe, the Science2Go! retail store, and five meeting rooms utilizing refurbished areas within the former Central High School, which the new COSI location was built around.

==History==
[[File:Central High School 1.jpg|thumb|Historic Central High School is now part of COSI]]
COSI opened on March 29, 1964, as a venture of the Franklin County Historical Society. COSI is a founding member of the Science Museum Exhibit Collaborative (SMEC) and a long-standing member of the [[Association of Science-Technology Centers]] (ASTC).

From its 1964 opening, COSI was housed in Memorial Hall, a Columbus landmark constructed in 1906. COSI closed at the Memorial Hall location on East Broad Street on September 6, 1999, and re-opened two months later on November 6, 1999, at its new location on the [[Scioto River|Scioto]] riverfront in [[Downtown Columbus, Ohio|downtown Columbus]]. The new, 320,000 square foot facility is one of the largest modern-built science centers in the world. The building was designed by internationally renowned Japanese architect [[Arata Isozaki]], who designed an elliptical, geometric, "blimp" shaped structure composed of 159 curved concrete panels.&lt;ref name="highconcrete1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.highconcrete.com/projects/applications/public/cultural/COSI.cfm|title=High Concrete Group}}&lt;/ref&gt; COSI is designed to appear progressively futuristic from the neighborhood of Franklinton, while from downtown Columbus it uses the exterior of the original Central High School to blend into the city.&lt;ref name="highconcrete1"/&gt;

[[Image:COSIHolidayPhoto.JPG|thumb|COSI's Holiday Science of the Season Celebration annually from the day before Thanksgiving to New Year's Eve.]]
Shortly after the move to the riverfront, the museum experienced a shortfall of funds. With an initial construction budget of over $210 million, high maintenance costs of the new facility, "six figure" utility bills, and "lower-than-expected" ticket sales, COSI's reliance on admission revenue proved to be an unsuitable long term plan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1388&amp;dat=20040421&amp;id=eodQAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=IRIEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3245,2222827|title=COSI Planetarium to go black; other programs scaled back}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004, the museum spearheaded an effort to assess a property tax levy, chaired by former [[NASA]] [[astronaut]] [[John Glenn]]. The levy would have imposed a property tax on residents of [[Franklin County, Ohio|Franklin County]], who would receive free admission in return. The levy failed. As a result, the south wing of COSI's "blimp" structure was closed.

As part of the reconfiguration of the museum following the loss of the levy in 2004, COSI opened only five days per week instead of seven. Many of the museum's exhibits were announced to close permanently (though many have re-opened in stages in the years since).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/cosi-to-reallocate-exhibit-spaces-in-september-71781782.html|title=COSI to reallocate exhibit spaces in September}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two of the original exhibit areas were closed permanently (called '''i|o''' and '''SimZone''', the spaces they formerly occupied are now Gallery 1 and Energy Explorers, respectively).

Closures from 2004 that have since been reversed include Space (relocated to Level 1 in 2005, then to the Mezzanine in 2012), the original Gallery 1 (space reused as WOSU@COSI in September 2006&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://ocio.osu.edu/blog/community/2006/09/28/wosucosi-grand-opening-set-for-september-29|title=WOSU@COSI Grand Opening}}&lt;/ref&gt;), Adventure (re-opened as an additional-charge experience in September 2010&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dispatch.com/content/stories/local/2010/07/12/COSI_to_reopen_Adventure_exhibit.html|title=COSI to reopen popular Adventure exhibit}}&lt;/ref&gt;), CityView (still off limits to the public; now available for special events), and the Planetarium (re-opened in November 2014 as the final piece of the building to come back online&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dispatch.com/content/stories/life_and_entertainment/2014/11/20/cosi-gets-star-attraction.html|title=COSI's renovated planetarium to reopen after decade absence}}&lt;/ref&gt;).

[[Image:Columbus-ohio-cosi-summer.jpg|thumb|COSI from across the Scioto River.]]

During the spring and summer of 2005, COSI hosted the blockbuster traveling exhibition "[[RMS Titanic|Titanic: The Artifact Exhibition]]" and saw record attendance (prompting the return of the exhibit in 2010). In the summer 2006, COSI hosted another large exhibit: "[[Star Wars: Where Science Meets Imagination]]", produced by the [[Museum of Science, Boston]].

In April 2006 Dr. David Chesebrough, former president and CEO of the [[Buffalo Museum of Science]], became COSI's new president and CEO.  He replaced  former NASA astronaut [[Kathryn D. Sullivan]], who transitioned to a new role as COSI science advisor on a volunteer basis while serving in her new role as the Director of [[Ohio State University]]'s [[Battelle Memorial Institute|Battelle]] Center for Mathematics and Science Education Policy.

Since then, COSI has integrated additional-cost traveling exhibits as part of its funding model. The museum has hosted ''EINSTEIN, An Exhibition on the Man and his Science'' (2007), ''Animation featuring Cartoon Network'' (2007), ''Gregor Mendel: Planting the Seeds of Genetics '' (2007), ''Bob the Builder: Project Build It'' (2007), ''Goosebumps!  The Science of Fear'' (2008), ''CSI: The Experience'' (2008), ''Adventures with Clifford the Big Red Dog'' (2010), ''Geckos: From Tail to Toepads'' (2011), ''Dinosaurs: Explore.  Escape. Survive.'' (2011), Dora and Diego - Let's Explore! (2011), RACE: Are We So Different? (2012), WATER (2012), LEGO Castle Adventure (2012), BODYWORLDS and The Brain (2012), MindBender Mansion and Amazing Mazes (2013), MythBusters: The Explosive Exhibition (2013), Curious George: Let's Get Curious! (2013), and Sherlock: The Exhibition (2014). As well, COSI developed its own traveling exhibit, ''Lost Egypt: Ancient Secrets, Modern Science'' (2009) in cooperation with the Science Museum Exhibit Collaborative, built by the Science Museum of Minnesota.  ''Lost Egypt'' now travels the nation to other museums.

In January 2016, Dr. Chesebrough announced that he planned to retire at the end of 2016.  A executive search firm was contracted, and an advisory committee formed, to identify candidates to succeed him as president and CEO.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dispatch.com/content/stories/local/2016/01/29/COSI_president_announces_retirement.html|title=President who helped revive COSI announces he'll retire|author=Shannon Gilchrist|work=[[Columbus Dispatch]]|date=January 29, 2016|accessdate=January 29, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 23, 2016, the Capitol South Community Redevelopment Corp. announced the approval of a $37 million plan to replace the 600-spot parking lots on COSI's west side with an underground parking garage topped with an 8-acre green space and programmatic park as a compliment to the larger Scioto Peninsula green space along the [[Scioto River]]. The construction project is expected to be completed in spring 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dispatch.com/content/stories/business/2016/08/23/cosi-underground-parking-park-okd.html|title=COSI underground parking, park get go-ahead|date=August 23, 2016|accessdate=September 26, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 16, 2016, COSI announced a partnership between the city of Columbus and the American Museum of Natural History (AMNH) in [[New York City]] to build a $5 million permanent Dinosaur Exhibition Gallery and a dedicated AMNH Traveling Exhibition Gallery replacing the WOSU and Adventure exhibits. The WOSU exhibit has since relocated; however, the Adventure exhibition closed permanently on January 1, 2017.&lt;ref name="dispatch.com"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dispatch.com/content/stories/local/2016/09/16/dinosaur-exhibit-at-cosi.html|title=&lt;nowiki&gt;$5 million from state budget to bring dinosaur exhibit to COSI]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;|date=September 16, 2016|accessdate=September 26, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nbc4i.com"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://nbc4i.com/2016/09/21/cosi-will-close-adventure-exhibit-to-make-room-for-natural-history-exhibits/|title=&lt;nowiki&gt;COSI will close ‘Adventure’ exhibit to make room for natural history galleries]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;|date=September 21, 2016|accessdate=September 26, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 10, 2016, the COSI board of trustees announced the selection of Dr. Frederic Bertley as COSI Columbus' new president and CEO, effective January 1, 2017. Dr. Bertley was previously senior vice president for science and education at the [[Franklin Institute]] in Philadelphia.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dispatch.com/content/stories/local/2016/11/10/new-president-and-ceo-of-cosi.html&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 1, 2017, the Adventure exhibit permanently closed to make room for COSI's Dinosaur Gallery.&lt;ref name="nbc4i.com" /&gt;

They later presented their business plan to IndieBio, an accelerator run by SOSV, who gave them $100,000 of funding. Tie took a leave of absence in 2014 after less than a year of college to work on the project in San Francisco with IndieBio.&lt;ref name=vars/&gt;

'''Clay dogs''' are naturally occurring [[clay]] formations that are sculpted by [[river]] currents from glacially deposited blue-gray clay and then dried by the sun. They exhibit tremendous variety in shape and size, with some being simple and others having highly complex forms. They only occur in a few places in the world. Until recently, [[Croton Point]] along the [[Hudson River]] produced them, but the clay slope that produced the dogs was subsequently demolished to extend a park lawn.&lt;ref name=Ward1982&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ward|first1=Colin|title=Jane Jacobs and the Clay Dogs|journal=Built Environment|date=1982|volume=8|issue=4|pages=229–231|jstor=23286047|publisher=Alexandrine Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; Clay dogs were described in detail in an article by L.

A '''cohort study''' is a particular form of [[longitudinal study]] that sample a [[Cohort (statistics)|cohort]] (a group of people who share a defining characteristic, typically those who experienced a common event in a selected period, such as birth or graduation), performing a [[Cross-sectional data|cross-section]] at intervals through time. While a cohort study is a panel study, a panel study is not always a cohort study as individuals in a panel study do not always share a common characteristic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://academia.stackexchange.com/questions/54017/what-is-the-difference-between-a-panel-study-and-a-cohort-study|title=What is the difference between a Panel Study and a Cohort Study?|website=Academia Stack Exchange|accessdate=3 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cohort studies represent one of the fundamental designs of [[epidemiology]] which are used in research in the fields of [[medicine]], [[nursing]], [[Psychological research|psychology]], [[social science]], and in any field reliant on 'difficult to reach' answers that are based on evidence ([[statistics]]). In medicine for instance, while clinical trials are used primarily for assessing the safety of newly developed pharmaceuticals before they are approved for sale, epidemiological analysis on how risk factors affect the incidence of diseases is often used to identify the causes of diseases in the first place, and to help provide pre-clinical justification for the plausibility of protective factors (treatments). Cohort studies differ from clinical trials in that no intervention, treatment, or exposure is administered to participants in a cohort design; and no control group is defined. Rather, cohort studies are largely about the life histories of segments of populations, and the individual people who constitute these segments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.socialresearchmethods.net/tutorial/Cho2/cohort.html|title=Cohort Studies|publisher=Web Center for Social Research Methods|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110909043451/http://www.socialresearchmethods.net/tutorial/Cho2/cohort.html|archivedate=2011-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.oup.com/us/catalog/general/subject/Medicine/EpidemiologyBiostatistics/?view=usa&amp;ci=9780195314502|title=A Dictionary of Epidemiology|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2008|editor-last=Porta|editor-first=Miquel|edition=5th|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; Exposures or protective factors are identified as preexisting characteristics of participants. The study is controlled by including other common characteristics of the cohort in the statistical analysis. Both exposure/treatment and control variables are measured at baseline. Participants are then followed over time to observe the incidence rate of the disease or outcome in question. Regression analysis can then be used to evaluate the extent to which the exposure or treatment variable contributes to the incidence of the disease, while accounting for other variables that may be at play.

[[Randomized controlled trial|Double-blind randomized controlled trial]]s (RCTs) are generally considered superior methodology in the [[hierarchy of evidence]] in treatment, because they allow for the most control over other variables that could affect the outcome, and the randomization and blinding processes reduce bias in the study design. This minimizes the chance that results will be influenced by [[confounding]] variables, particularly ones that are unknown. However, educated hypotheses based on prior research and background knowledge are used to select variables to be included in the regression model for cohort studies, and statistical methods can be used to identify and account potential confounders from these variables. Bias can also be mitigated in a cohort study when selecting participants for the cohort. It is also important to note that RCTs may not be suitable in all cases; such as when the outcome is a negative health effect and the exposure is hypothesized to be a risk factor for the outcome. Ethical standards, and morality, would prevent the use of risk factors in RCTs. The natural or incidental exposure to these risk factors (e.g. time spent in the sun), or self-administered exposure (e.g. smoking), can be measured without subjecting participants to risk factors outside of their individual lifestyles, habits, and choices.

Cohort studies can be [[Retrospective cohort study|retrospective]] (looking back in time, thus using existing data such as medical records or claims database) or [[Prospective cohort study|prospective]] (requiring the collection of new data).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ehib.org/faq.jsp?faq_key=37|title=FAQ: What is a cohort study?|date=June 2, 2001|publisher=California Department of Public Health, Environmental Health Investigations Branch|access-date=10 September 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110726020518/http://www.ehib.org/faq.jsp?faq_key=37|archive-date=26 July 2011|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Retrospectives cohort studies restrict the investigators ability to reduce confounding and bias because collected information is restricted to data that already exists. There are advantages to this design however, as retrospective studies are much cheaper and faster because the data has already been collected and stored.

A [[cohort (statistics)|cohort]] is a group of people who share a common characteristic or experience within a defined period (e.g., are currently living, are exposed to a drug or vaccine or pollutant, or undergo a certain medical procedure). Thus a group of people who were born on a day or in a particular period, say 1948, form a birth cohort. The comparison group may be the general population from which the cohort is drawn, or it may be another cohort of persons thought to have had little or no exposure to the substance under investigation, but otherwise similar. Alternatively, subgroups within the cohort may be compared with each other.

Indicators of cohort study: 
# When there is a strong association between cause and effect, established by any observational study
# When the exposure is rare, but incidence of disease among exposed is high
# When people's attrition can be minimized
# When resources are ample

==Application==

In medicine, a cohort study is often undertaken to obtain evidence to try to refute the existence of a suspected association between cause and effect; failure to refute a hypothesis often strengthens confidence in it. Crucially, the cohort is identified before the appearance of the disease under investigation. The study groups follow a group of people who do not have the disease for a period of time and see who develops the disease (new incidence). The cohort cannot therefore be defined as a group of people who already have the disease. Prospective (longitudinal) cohort studies between exposure and disease strongly aid in studying causal associations, though distinguishing true causality usually requires further corroboration from further experimental trials.

The advantage of prospective cohort study data is that it can help determine risk factors for contracting a new disease because it is a longitudinal observation of the individual through time, and the collection of data at regular intervals, so recall error is reduced. However, cohort studies are expensive to conduct, are sensitive to [[Attrition (medicine, epidemiology)|attrition]] and take a long follow-up time to generate useful data. Nevertheless, the results that are obtained from long-term cohort studies are of substantially superior quality to those obtained from retrospective/cross-sectional studies. Prospective cohort studies are considered to yield the most reliable results in observational epidemiology. They enable a wide range of exposure-disease associations to be studied.

Some cohort studies track groups of children from their birth, and record a wide range of information (exposures) about them. The value of a cohort study depends on the researchers' capacity to stay in touch with all members of the cohort. Some studies have continued for decades.

In a cohort study, the population under investigation consists of individuals who are at risk of developing a specific disease or health outcome.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor-first1=Lorna |editor-last1=Fewtrell |editor-first2=Jamie |editor-last2=Bartram |title=Water Quality: Guidelines, Standards, and Health : Assessment of Risk and Risk Management for Water-related Infectious Disease |first1=Ursula J. |last1=Blumenthal |first2=Jay M. |last2=Fleisher |first3=Steve A. |last3=Esrey |first4=Anne |last4=Peasey |chapter=Chapter 7: Epidemiology: a tool for the assessment of risk |publisher=IWA Publishing |year=2001 |chapterurl=http://www.who.int/water_sanitation_health/dwq/iwachap7.pdf |pages=143–144}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==
{{Cleanup|section|date=July 2011}}

An example of an epidemiological question that can be answered using a cohort study is whether exposure to X (say, smoking) associates with outcome Y (say, lung cancer). In 1951, commenced the [[British Doctors Study]], a cohort that included both smokers (the exposed group) and non-smokers (the unexposed group). The study continued through 2001. By 1956, the study provided convincing proof of the association of smoking with the incidence of lung cancer.  In a cohort study, the groups are ''matched'' in terms of many other variables such as economic status and other health status so that the variable being assessed, the [[independent variable]] (in this case, smoking) can be isolated as the cause of the [[dependent variable]] (in this case, lung cancer). In this example, a [[Statistical significance|statistically significant]] increase in the incidence of lung cancer in the smoking group as compared to the non-smoking group is evidence in favor of the hypothesis. However, rare outcomes, such as lung cancer, are generally not studied with the use of a cohort study, but are rather studied with the use of a [[case-control]] study.

Shorter term studies are commonly used in medical research as a form of [[clinical trial]], or means to test a particular hypothesis of clinical importance. Such studies typically follow two groups of patients for a period of time and compare an endpoint or outcome measure between the two groups.

[[Randomized controlled trial]]s, or RCTs are a superior methodology in the hierarchy of evidence, because they limit the potential for bias by randomly assigning one patient pool to an intervention and another patient pool to non-intervention (or placebo). This minimizes the chance that the incidence of confounding variables will differ between the two groups.

Nevertheless, it is sometimes not practical or ethical to perform RCTs to answer a clinical question. To take our example, if we already had reasonable evidence that smoking causes lung cancer then persuading a pool of non-smokers to take up smoking in order to test this hypothesis would generally be considered quite unethical.

Two examples of cohort studies that have been going on for more than 50 years are the [[Framingham Heart Study]] and the [[National Child Development Study]] (NCDS), the most widely researched of the [[British birth cohort studies]]. Key findings of NCDS and a detailed profile of the study appear in the ''International Journal of Epidemiology''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Power C, Elliott J|title=Cohort profile: 1958 British Cohort Study |journal=International Journal of Epidemiology |volume=35 |issue=1 |pages=34–41 |year=2006 |doi=10.1093/ije/dyi183 |pmid=16155052}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Dunedin Longitudinal Study]], started in 1975, has been studying the thousand  people born in [[Dunedin]], New Zealand in 1972-73. The subjects are interviewed regularly, with Phase 45 starting in 2017.

The largest cohort study in women is the [[Nurses' Health Study]]. Started in 1976, it is tracking over 120,000 nurses and has been analyzed for many different conditions and outcomes.

The largest cohort study in Africa is the [[Birth to Twenty]] Study, which began in 1990 and tracks a cohort of over 3,000 children born in the weeks following [[Nelson Mandela]]'s release from prison.

Other famous examples are the [[Grant Study]] tracking a number of Harvard graduates from ca. 1950.77, the [[Whitehall Study]] tracking 10,308 British civil servants, and the [[Caerphilly Heart Disease Study]], which since 1979 has studied a representative sample of 2,512 men, drawn from the Welsh town of Caerphilly.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|pmc=1052363|year=1984|title=Caerphilly and Speedwell collaborative heart disease studies.

The diagram indicates the starting point and direction of cohort and case-control studies.
In Case-control studies the analysis proceeds from documented disease and investigations are made to arrive at the possible causes of the disease. In cohort studies the assessments starts with the putative cause of disease, and observations are made of the occurrence of disease relative to the hypothesized causal agent'''.&lt;ref name="gfmer.ch"&gt;{{cite book |editor-first=Aldo |editor-last=Campana |first=O. |last=Meirik |title=Reproductive Health |chapterurl=http://www.gfmer.ch/Books/Reproductive_health/Cohort_and_case_control_studies.html |chapter=Cohort and Case-Control Studies |publisher=Geneva Foundation for Medical Education and Research}}&lt;/ref&gt;'''

===Current and historical cohorts===
{{main|Retrospective cohort study}}

A current cohort study represents a true prospective study where the data concerning exposure are assembled prior to the occurrence of the fact to be studied, for instance a disease. An example of a current cohort study is the Oxford Family Planning Association Study in the United Kingdom, which aimed to provide a balanced view of the beneficial and harmful effects of different methods of contraception. This study has provided a large amount of information on the efficacy and safety of contraceptive methods, and in particular oral contraceptives (OCs), diaphragms and intrauterine device (IUDs).{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}

In a historical cohort study the data concerning exposure and occurrence of a disease, births, a political attitude or any other categorical variable are collected after the events have taken place, and the subjects (those exposed and unexposed to the agent under study) are assembled from existing records or health care registers.

A "[[prospective cohort]]" defines the groups before the study is done, while historical studies, which are sometimes referred to as "[[retrospective cohort]]", defines the grouping after the data is collected. Examples of a [[retrospective cohort]] are ''Long-Term Mortality after Gastric Bypass Surgery''&lt;ref name="pmid17715409"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Adams TD |title=Long-term mortality after gastric bypass surgery |journal=N.

Although historical studies are sometimes referred to as retrospective study, it a misnomer as the methodological principles of historical cohort studies and prospective studies are the same.&lt;ref name="gfmer.ch"/&gt;

===Nested case-control study===

===Household panel survey===
Household panel surveys are an important sub-type of cohort study. These draw representative samples of households and survey them, following all individuals through time on a usually annual basis. Examples include the US [[Panel Study of Income Dynamics]] (since 1968), the ''German'' [[Socio-Economic Panel]] (since 1984), the [[British Household Panel Survey]] (since 1991), the [[Household, Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia Survey]] (since 2001) and the [[European Community Household Panel]] (1994–2001).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13069">A wide variety of different wireless data technologies exist, some in direct competition with one another, others designed for specific applications. Wireless technologies can be evaluated by a variety of different metrics of which some are described in this entry.

Standards can be grouped as follows in increasing range order:

[[Personal Area Network]] (PAN) systems are intended for short range communication between devices typically controlled by a single person. Some examples include wireless headsets for mobile phones or wireless heart rate sensors communicating with a wrist watch. Some of these technologies include standards such as [[ANT (network)|ANT]] [[Ultra-wideband|UWB]], [[Bluetooth]], [[ZigBee]], and [[Wireless USB]].

[[Wireless Sensor Networks]] (WSN / WSAN) are, generically, networks of low-power, low-cost devices that interconnect wirelessly to collect, exchange, and sometimes act-on data collected from their physical environments - "sensor networks".  Nodes typically connect in a star or mesh topology.  While most individual nodes in a WSAN are expected to have limited range ([[Bluetooth]], [[ZigBee]], [[6LoWPAN]], etc.), particular nodes may be capable of more expansive communications ([[Wi-Fi]], [[Cellular networks]], etc.) and any individual WSAN can span a wide geographical range.  An example of a WSAN would be a collection of sensors arranged throughout an agricultural facility to monitor soil moisture levels, report the data back to a computer in the main office for analysis and trend modeling, and maybe turn on automatic watering spigots if the level is too low.

For wider area communications, [[Wireless Local Area Network]] (WLAN) is used. WLANs are often known by their commercial product name [[Wi-Fi]]. These systems are used to provide wireless access to other systems on the local network such as other computers, shared printers, and other such devices or even the internet. Typically a WLAN offers much better speeds and delays within the local network than an average consumer's [[Internet access]]. Older systems that provide WLAN functionality include [[DECT]] and [[HIPERLAN]]. These however are no longer in widespread use. One typical characteristic of WLANs is that they are mostly very local, without the capability of seamless movement from one network to another.

[[Cellular networks]] or [[Wide Area Network|WAN]] are designed for citywide/national/global coverage areas and seamless mobility from one access point (often defined as a [[Base Station]]) to another allowing seamless coverage for very wide areas. Cellular network technologies are often split into 2nd generation [[2G]], [[3G]] and [[4G]] networks. Originally 2G networks were voice centric or even voice only digital cellular systems (as opposed to the analog 1G networks). Typical 2G standards include [[GSM]] and [[IS-95]] with extensions via [[GPRS]], [[EDGE]] and [[CDMA2000#1X|1xRTT]], providing Internet access to users of originally voice centric 2G networks. Both [[EDGE]] and [[1xRTT]] are 3G standards, as defined by the [[IMT-2000|ITU]], but are usually marketed as 2.9G due to their comparatively low speeds and high delays when compared to true 3G technologies.

True 3G systems such as [[EV-DO]], [[W-CDMA]] (including [[High Speed Packet Access|HSPA]]) provide combined [[Circuit switching|circuit switched]] and [[Packet switching|packet switched]] data and voice services from the outset, usually at far better data rates than 2G networks with their extensions. All of these services can be used to provide combined mobile voice access and Internet access at remote locations.

4G networks provide even higher bitrates and many architectural improvements, which are not necessarily visible to the consumer. The current 4G systems that are deployed widely are [[HSPA+]], [[WIMAX]] and [[LTE (telecommunication)|LTE]]. The latter two are pure packet based networks without traditional voice circuit capabilities. These networks provide voice services via [[Voice over IP|VoIP]].

Some systems are designed for point-to-point line-of-sight communications, once two such nodes get too far apart they can no longer communicate. Other systems are designed to form a [[wireless mesh network]] using one of a variety of [[list of ad hoc routing protocols|routing protocols]]. In a mesh network, when nodes get too far apart to communicate directly, they can still communicate indirectly  through intermediate nodes.

== Peak bit rate and throughput ==
When discussing throughput, there is often a distinction between the peak data rate of the physical layer, the theoretical maximum data throughput and typical throughput.

The peak bit rate of the standard is the [[net bit rate]] provided by the physical layer in the fastest transmission mode (using the fastest modulation scheme and error code), excluding forward error correction coding and other physical layer overhead.

The theoretical [[maximum throughput]] for end user is  clearly lower than the peak data rate due to higher layer overheads. Even this is never possible to achieve unless the test is done under perfect laboratory conditions.

The typical throughput is what users have experienced most of the time when well within the usable range to the base station. The typical throughput is hard to measure, and depends on many protocol issues such as transmission schemes (slower schemes are used at longer distance from the access point due to better redundancy), packet retransmissions and packet size. The typical [[throughput]] is often even lower because of other traffic sharing the same network or cell, interference or even the fixed line capacity from the base station onwards being limited.

Note that these figures cannot be used to predict the performance of any given standard in any given environment, but rather as benchmarks against which actual experience might be compared.

'''Drapetomania''' was a conjectural [[mental illness]] that, in 1851, American physician [[Samuel A. Cartwright]] hypothesized as the cause of [[black slaves|enslaved Africans]] [[Fugitive slaves in the United States|fleeing captivity]].&lt;ref name="White"&gt;{{cite book|last=White|first=Kevin|title=An introduction to the sociology of health and illness|year=2002|publisher=SAGE|isbn=0-7619-6400-2|pages=41, 42|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5bHxQBNWGHMC&amp;pg=PA41}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|41}} It has since been debunked as [[pseudoscience]]&lt;ref name="Caplan"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Caplan |first1=Arthur |last2=McCartney |first2=James |last3=Sisti |first3=Dominic |title=Health, disease, and illness: concepts in medicine |year=2004 |publisher=[[Georgetown University Press]] |isbn=1-58901-014-0 |pages=|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NmHCGb3GvJoC&amp;pg=PA2}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|2}} and part of the edifice of [[scientific racism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ferris.edu/jimcrow/question/nov05.htm |title=Question of the Month: Drapetomania |accessdate=2007-10-04 |author=Pilgrim, David |date=November 2005 |publisher=Jim Crow Museum of Racist Memorabilia |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Etymology ==
The term derives from the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] δραπέτης (''drapetes'', "a runaway [slave]") and μανία (''mania'', "madness, frenzy").&lt;ref name=Cartwright&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cartwright|first=Samuel A.|authorlink=Samuel A. Cartwright|title=Diseases and Peculiarities of the Negro Race|journal=[[DeBow's Review]]|year=1851|volume=XI|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/aia/part4/4h3106t.html|accessdate=16 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Description ==
In ''Diseases and Peculiarities of the Negro Race'', Cartwright points out that the [[Bible]] calls for a slave to be submissive to his master, and by doing so, the slave will have no desire to run away.&lt;ref name=Cartwright/&gt;

{{quote|If the white man attempts to oppose the Deity's will, by trying to make the negro anything else than "the submissive knee-bender" (which the Almighty declared he should be), by trying to raise him to a level with himself, or by putting himself on an equality with the negro; or if he abuses the power which God has given him over his fellow-man, by being cruel to him, or punishing him in anger, or by neglecting to protect him from the wanton abuses of his fellow-servants and all others, or by denying him the usual comforts and necessaries of life, the negro will run away; but if he keeps him in the position that we learn from the Scriptures he was intended to occupy, that is, the position of submission; and if his master or overseer be kind and gracious in his hearing towards him, without condescension, and at the same time ministers to his physical wants, and protects him from abuses, the negro is spell-bound, and cannot run away.&lt;ref name=Cartwright/&gt;}}&lt;!--

--&gt;Cartwright described the disorder&amp;nbsp;– which, he said, was "unknown to our medical authorities, although its diagnostic symptom, the absconding from service, is well known to our planters and overseers"&lt;ref name=Cartwright/&gt;&amp;nbsp;– in a paper delivered before the Medical Association of Louisiana&lt;ref name="Caplan"/&gt;{{rp|291}} that was widely reprinted.

He stated that the malady was a consequence of masters who "made themselves too familiar with [slaves], treating them as equals".&lt;ref&gt;Baynton, Douglas C. "Disability and the Justification of Inequality in American History". ''The New Disability History: American Perspectives'', 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|If treated kindly, well fed and clothed, with fuel enough to keep a small fire burning all night--separated into families, each family having its own house--not permitted to run about at night to visit their neighbors, to receive visits or use intoxicating liquors, and not overworked or exposed too much to the weather, they are very easily governed--more so than any other people in the world. If any one or more of them, at any time, are inclined to raise their heads to a level with their master or overseer, humanity and their own good requires that they should be punished until they fall into that submissive state which was intended for them to occupy. They have only to be kept in that state, and treated like children to prevent and cure them from running away.&lt;ref&gt;S. L.  Chorover. ''From Genesis to Genocide'' (Cambridge, Massachusetts: [[MIT Press]] 1974). p. 150.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

=== Prevention and remedy ===

In addition to identifying drapetomania, Cartwright prescribed a remedy. His feeling was that with "proper medical advice, strictly followed, this troublesome practice that many Negroes have of running away can be almost entirely prevented".&lt;ref name=Cartwright/&gt;

In the case of slaves "sulky and dissatisfied without cause"&amp;nbsp;– a warning sign of imminent flight&amp;nbsp;– Cartwright prescribed "[[flagellation|whipping]] the devil out of them" as a "preventative measure".&lt;ref name="Caplan"/&gt;{{rp|35}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Slavery &amp; the Law |author= Paul Finkelman|year=1997|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield|isbn=0-7425-2119-2|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1YI0DvuukxkC&amp;pg=PA305| page=305}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Slavery and Emancipation |author=Rick Halpern, Enrico Dal Lago |year=2002 |publisher=Blackwell Publishing |isbn=0-631-21735-5 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=svaQthjrcf0C&amp;pg=RA1-PA273&amp;sig=BuyUaEXNumrkqdvdpvtSh0P4CyU |page=273}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a remedy for this "disease", doctors also made running a physical impossibility by prescribing the removal of both big toes.&lt;ref name="White"/&gt;{{rp|42}}

===Contemporary criticism===

While Cartwright's article was reprinted in the South, in the [[northern United States]] it was widely mocked. A satirical analysis of the article appeared in a ''Buffalo Medical Journal'' editorial in 1855.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=S. B.

As late as 1914, the third edition of [[Thomas Lathrop Stedman]]'s ''Practical Medical Dictionary'' included an entry for ''drapetomania'', defined as "[[Vagrancy (people)|Vagabondage]], [[dromomania]]; an uncontrollable or insane impulsion to wander."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Stedman |first=Thomas Lathrop |year=1914 |article=drapetomania |title=Practical Medical Dictionary |edition=3rd |location=New York |publisher=W.

''Ethnoscape'' is one of five elementary frameworks ('''''ethnoscapes''''', ''[[mediascape]]s'', ''[[technoscape]]s'', ''[[financescape]]s'', and ''[[ideoscape]]s'') used by [[Arjun Appadurai]], in purpose of exploring fundamental discrepancies of global cultural flows. The suffix ''-scape'' indicates that these terms are perspectival constructs inflected by the historical, [[Linguistics|linguistic]], and political situatedness of different kinds of actors: nation-states, multinationals, diasporic communities, and subnational groupings and movements, whether religious, political, or economic, etc..

By using the ethnoscape, Appadurai extends the landscape of persons who form the shifting world where we live, that is, tourists, [[Immigration|immigrants]], refugees, or any moving groups and individuals of fundamental feature of the world and appear to affect the politics of (and between) nations to a hitherto unprecedented degree.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Frank J. and Boli|first1=Frank J. and John|title=The Globalization Reader|date=2012|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd.|page=98|edition=4th}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Appadurai|first1=Arjun|title=Disjuncture and Difference in the Global Cultural Economy|journal=Modernity at Large: Cultural Dimensions of Globalization|date=1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; Appadurai claims that this is not to say there are no relatively stable communities and networks of kinship, friendship, work, and leisure, as well as of birth, residence, and other filial forms. But it is to say that the warp of these stabilities is everywhere shot through with the weft of human motion, as more persons and groups deal with the realities of having to move of the fantasies of wanting to move. Ethnoscapes allow us to recognize that our notions of space, place and community have become much more complex, indeed a ‘single community’ may now be dispersed across a variety of sites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Smart|first1=B.|title=Postmodernity|date=1993|publisher=London: Routledge}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Feminism and Nationalism in the Third World''''' written by [[Kumari Jayawardena]] is widely used in [[women's studies]] programs around the world and is considered a key text of [[third-world feminism]].

Jayawardena reconstructs the history of [[women's rights]] movements in Asia and the Middle East from the 19th century&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Pui-lan|first=Kwok|title=Postcolonial Imagination And Feminist Theology|year=2006|publisher=Westminster John Knox Press|location=Louisville, Ky.|isbn=978-0-664-22883-5|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eSLjaaWrd4sC&amp;lpg=PA151&amp;ots=PXTVRCfpyj&amp;dq=%22Feminism%20and%20Nationalism%20in%20the%20Third%20World%22&amp;pg=PA151#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|edition=1st|page=151}}&lt;/ref&gt; to the 1980s, focusing on [[Egypt]], [[Turkey]], [[Iran]], [[India]], [[Sri Lanka]], [[China]], [[Indonesia]], [[Vietnam]], [[Japan]], [[Korea]], and the [[Philippines]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Firat|first=Bilge|title=Dissident, But Hegemonic: A Critical Review of Feminist Studies on Gendered Nationalism in Turkey|year=2006|isbn=978-0-542-80868-5|pages=48–49|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ITAjwoECse8C&amp;lpg=PA48&amp;ots=Jnq8kahTPI&amp;dq=%22Feminism%20and%20Nationalism%20in%20the%20Third%20World%22&amp;pg=PA48#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her research shows that [[feminism]] was ''not'' a foreign ideology 'imposed' on 'Third World' countries, but instead, was indigenous to Asia and the Middle East as women struggled for equal rights and against the subordination of women in the home and in society in general.

Jayawardena is the author of several other books, including ''The Rise of the Labor Movement in Ceylon'' and ''Embodied Violence: Communalising Women's Sexuality in South Asia''. (Co-edited with [[Malathi de Alwis]]). However ''Feminism and Nationalism in the Third World'' is one of Jayawarden's oft-cited works and has gained international recognition. The book was chosen for the Feminist Fortnight award in Britain in 1986 and was cited by [[Ms. (magazine)|''Ms.'' magazine]] in 1992 as one of the 20 most important books of 'the feminist decades' (i.e. 1970-1990).&lt;ref&gt;“Feminist Classics of This Wave” in Ms. 1 vol. 3 (Arlington, 1992): 65.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[image:Woy Woy Channel - Vignetted.jpg|thumb|210px|The brightness variation due to [[vignetting]], as shown here, can be corrected by selectively brightening the perimeter of the image.]]
'''Flat-field correction''' is a technique used to improve quality in [[digital imaging]].  The goal is to remove artifacts from 2-D images that are caused by variations in the pixel-to-pixel sensitivity of the detector and/or by distortions in the optical path.  It is a standard calibration procedure in everything from pocket [[digital camera]]s to giant telescopes.

==Overview==
Flat fielding refers to the process of compensating for different [[Gain (electronics)|gains]] and [[dark current (physics)|dark currents]] in a detector. Once a detector has been appropriately flat-fielded, a uniform signal will create a uniform output (hence flat-field). This then means any further signal is due to the phenomenon being detected and not a [[systematic error]].

A flat-field consists of two numbers for each pixel, the pixel's gain and its dark current (or [[dark frame]]). The pixel's gain is how the amount of signal given by the detector varies as a function of the amount of light (or equivalent). The gain is almost always a linear variable, as such the gain is given simply as the ratio of the input and output signals. The dark-current is the amount of signal given out by the detector when there is no incident light (hence dark frame). In many detectors this can also be a function of time, for example in astronomical telescopes it is common to take a dark-frame of the same time as the planned light exposure. The gain and dark-frame for optical systems can also be established by using a series of [[neutral density filter]]s to give input/output signal information and applying a least squares fit to obtain the values for the dark current and gain.
&lt;math&gt;

C = {{(R - D)*m}\over{(F-D)}} = {(R-D)*G}

&lt;/math&gt;

where:

* C = corrected image
* R = raw image
* F = flat field image
* D = dark field or dark frame
* m = image-averaged value of (F-D)
* G = Gain = &lt;math&gt;m\over(F-D)&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.princetoninstruments.com/cms/index.php/ccd-primer/152-flat-field-correction&lt;/ref&gt;

In this equation, capital letters are 2D matrices, and lowercase letters are scalars. All matrix operations are performed element-by-element.

In order for an astrophotographer to capture a light frame, he or she must place a light source over the imaging instrument's objective lens such that the light source emanates evenly through the users optics.  The photographer must then adjust the exposure of their imaging device (CCD or DSLR camera) so that when the histogram of the image is viewed, a peak reaching about 40&amp;ndash;70% of the dynamic range (maximum range of pixel values) of the imaging device is seen. The photographer typically takes 15&amp;ndash;20 light frames and performs median stacking. Once the desired light frames are acquired, the objective lens is covered so that no light is allowed in, then 15&amp;ndash;20 dark frames are taken, each of equal exposure time as a light frame. These are called Dark-Flat frames.

== Flat field correction in X-ray imaging ==

In X-ray imaging, the acquired projection images generally suffer from fixed-pattern noise, which is one of the limiting factors of image quality. It may stem from beam inhomogeneity, gain variations of the detector response due to inhomogeneities in the photon conversion yield, losses in charge transport, charge trapping, or variations in the performance of the readout. Also, the scintillator screen may accumulate dust and/or scratches on its surface, resulting in systematic patterns in every acquired X-ray projection image. In X-ray Computed Tomography (CT), fixed-pattern noise is known to significantly degrade the achievable spatial resolution and generally leads to ring or band artifacts in the reconstructed images. Fixed pattern noise can be easily removed using flat field correction. In conventional flat field correction, projection images without sample are acquired with and without the X-ray beam turned on, which are referred to as flat fields (F) and dark fields (D). Based on the acquired flat and dark fields, the measured projection images (P) with sample are then normalized to new images (N) according to &lt;ref name="VanNieuwenhove"&gt;[[#DynFFC|Van Nieuwenhove 2015.]]&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;math&gt; N = {{(P-D)}\over{(F-D)}}&lt;/math&gt;

== Dynamic flat field correction ==

While conventional flat field correction is an elegant and easy procedure that largely reduces fixed-pattern noise, it heavily relies on the stationarity of the X-ray beam, scintillator response and CCD sensitivity. In practice, however, this assumption is only approximately met. Indeed, detector elements are characterized by intensity dependent, nonlinear response functions and the incident beam often shows time dependent non-uniformities, which render conventional FFC inadequate. In synchrotron X-ray tomography, many factors may cause flat field variations: instability of the bending magnets of the synchrotron, temperature variations due to the water cooling in mirrors and the monochromator, or vibrations of the scintillator and other beamline components. The latter is responsible for the biggest variations in the flat fields. To deal with such variations, a '''''dynamic''''' '''flat field correction''' procedure can be employed that estimates a flat field for each individual projection. Through principal component analysis of a set of flat fields, which are acquired prior and/or posterior to the actual scan, eigen flat fields can be computed. A linear combination of the most important eigen flat fields can then used to individually normalize each X-ray projection:&lt;ref name="VanNieuwenhove" /&gt;

&lt;math&gt;
N_j = {{P_j - \bar D}\over{\bar F+\sum_k w_{jk}u_k-\bar D}}
&lt;/math&gt;

* &lt;math&gt;N_j&lt;/math&gt; = intensity normalized X-ray projection
* &lt;math&gt;P_j&lt;/math&gt; = raw X-ray projection
* &lt;math&gt;\bar F&lt;/math&gt; = mean flat field image (average of flat fields)
* &lt;math&gt;u_k&lt;/math&gt; = k-th eigen flat field
* &lt;math&gt;w_{jk}&lt;/math&gt; = weight of the eigen flat field &lt;math&gt;u_k&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;\bar D&lt;/math&gt; = mean dark field (average of dark fields)

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2159">'''Free molecular flow''' describes the [[fluid dynamics]] of gas where the [[mean free path]] of the molecules is larger than the size of the chamber or of the object under test. For tubes/objects of the size of several cm, this means pressures well below 10&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt; [[mbar]]. This is also called the regime of high [[vacuum]], or even [[ultra-high vacuum]]. This is opposed to [[viscous flow]] encountered at higher pressures.&lt;ref&gt;Yamamoto, K.; Pack, D. C.; Transient free molecular flow through a tube; Rarefied gas dynamics; Proceedings of the Eleventh International Symposium, Cannes, France, July 3-8, 1978. Volume 1. (A80-34876 14-77) Paris, Commissariat a l'Energie Atomique, 1979, p. 207-218.&lt;/ref&gt; The presence of free molecular flow can be calculated, at least in estimation, with the [[Knudsen number]] (Kn). If Kn &gt; 1, the system is in free molecular flow.

In free molecular flow, the pressure of the remaining gas can be considered as effectively zero. Thus, boiling points do not depend on the residual pressure. The flow can be considered to be individual particles moving in straight lines. Practically, the "vapor" cannot move around bends or into other spaces behind obstacles, as they simply hit the tube wall. This implies conventional pumps cannot be used, as they rely on viscous flow and fluid pressure. Instead, special [[sorption pump]]s and [[Ion pump (physics)|ion pump]]s must be used.

Free molecular flow occurs in various processes such as [[molecular distillation]], [[ultra-high vacuum]] equipment such as [[particle accelerator]]s, and naturally in [[outer space]].

The definition of a free molecular flow depends on the distance scale under consideration. For example, in the [[interplanetary medium]], the plasma is in a free molecular flow regime in scales less than 1 AU; thus, planets and moons are effectively under particle bombardment. However, on larger scales, fluid-like behavior is observed, because the probability of collisions between particles becomes significant.

'''Fuzzy architectural spatial analysis (FASA)''' (also '''fuzzy inference system (FIS) based architectural space analysis''' or '''fuzzy spatial analysis''') is a [[spatial analysis]] method of analysing the spatial formation and architectural space intensity within any architectural organization.&lt;ref&gt;Arabacioglu, Burcin Cem (2010). "Using fuzzy inference system for architectural space analysis". Applied Soft Computing 10 (3): 926–937. {{doi|10.1016/j.asoc.2009.10.011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fuzzy architectural spatial analysis is used in [[architecture]], [[interior design]], [[urban planning]] and similar [[spatial design]] fields.

==Overview==
Fuzzy architectural spatial analysis was developed by [[Burcin Cem Arabacioglu]] (2010) from the architectural theories of [[space syntax]]&lt;ref&gt;Hillier, Bill and Hanson, Julienne (1984), "The Social Logic of Space", Cambridge University Press: Cambridge.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hillier, Bill (1999), "Space is the Machine: A Configurational Theory of Architecture", Cambridge University Press: Cambridge.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[visibility graph analysis]],&lt;ref&gt;Turner, Alasdair; Doxa, Maria; O'Sullivan, David and Penn, Alan (2001). "From isovists to visibility graphs: a methodology for the analysis of architectural space". Environment and Planning B 28 (1): 103–121. {{doi|10.1068/b2684}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and is applied with the help of a fuzzy system with a Mamdami inference system based on [[fuzzy logic]] within any architectural space. Fuzzy architectural spatial analysis model analyses the space by considering the perceivable architectural element by their boundary and stress characteristics and intensity properties. The method is capable of taking all [[Sense|sensorial]] factors into account during analyses in conformably with the [[perception]] process of architectural space which is a multi-sensorial act.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16188">[[Image:AT-GC.jpg|thumb|400px|Nucleotide bonds showing AT and GC pairs. Arrows point to the [[hydrogen bond]]s.]]
In [[molecular biology]] and [[genetics]], '''GC-content''' (or '''guanine-cytosine content''') is the percentage of [[nitrogenous bases]] on a [[DNA]] or [[RNA]] molecule that are either [[guanine]] or [[cytosine]] (from a possibility of four different ones, also including [[adenine]] and [[thymine]] in DNA and adenine and [[uracil]] in RNA).&lt;ref&gt;[http://cancerweb.ncl.ac.uk/cgi-bin/omd?GC+content Definition of GC – content on CancerWeb of [[Newcastle University]],UK]&lt;/ref&gt; This may refer to a certain fragment of DNA or RNA, or that of the [[Genome|whole genome]]. When it refers to a fragment of the genetic material, it may denote the GC-content of section of a gene (domain), single gene, group of genes (or gene clusters), or even a non-coding region.

== Structure ==
Qualitativelty, G (guanine) and C (cytosine) undergo a specific [[hydrogen bonding]], whereas A (adenine) bonds specifically with T (thymine, in DNA) or U (uracil, in RNA). Quantitativelty, the GC pair is bound by three [[hydrogen bond]]s, while AT and AU pairs are bound by two hydrogen bonds. To emphasize this difference in the number of hydrogen bonds, the base pairings can be represented as respectively G≡C versus A=T and A=U. DNA with low GC-content is less stable than DNA with high GC-content; however, the hydrogen bonds themselves do not have a particularly significant impact on stabilization, the stabilization is due mainly to interactions of base stacking.&lt;ref name ="Yakovchuk2006"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Yakovchuk P, Protozanova E, Frank-Kamenetskii MD |title=Base-stacking and base-pairing contributions into thermal stability of the DNA double helix |journal=Nucleic Acids Res. |volume=34 |issue=2 |pages=564–74 |year=2006 |pmid=16449200 |pmc=1360284 |doi=10.1093/nar/gkj454 |url=http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=16449200}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In spite of the higher [[thermostability]] conferred to the genetic material, it has been observed that at least some bacteria species with DNA of high GC-content undergo [[Autolysis (biology)|autolysis]] more readily, thereby reducing the longevity of the cell ''per se''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Levin RE, Van Sickle C |title=Autolysis of high-GC isolates of Pseudomonas putrefaciens |journal=Antonie van Leeuwenhoek |volume=42 |issue=1–2 |pages=145–55 |year=1976 |pmid=7999 |doi=10.1007/BF00399459 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the thermostability given to the genetic materials in high GC organisms, it was commonly believed that the GC content played a necessary role in adaptation temperatures, a hypothesis that was refuted in 2001.&lt;ref name="Hurst2001"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Hurst LD, Merchant AR |title = High guanine-cytosine content is not an adaptation to high temperature: a comparative analysis amongst prokaryotes|journal = Proc. Biol. Sci.|volume = 268|issue = 1466|pages = 493–7|date = March 2001|pmid = 11296861|pmc = 1088632|doi = 10.1098/rspb.2000.1397|url = http://rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/268/1466/493}}&lt;/ref&gt;
However, it has been shown that there is a strong correlation between the prokaryotic optimal growth at higher temperatures and the GC content of structured RNAs (such as [[ribosomal RNA]], [[transfer RNA]], and many other [[non-coding RNA]]s).&lt;ref name="Hurst2001" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Galtier | first1=N. | last2=Lobry | first2=J.R. | title=Relationships between genomic G+C content, RNA secondary structures, and optimal growth temperature in Prokaryotes | journal=Journal of Molecular Evolution| volume=44 | pages=632–636 | year=1997 | pmid=9169555 | doi=10.1007/PL00006186 | issue=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The AU base pairs are less stable than the GC [[base pair]]s previously attributed to GC bonds containing 3 hydrogen bonds and AU having only 2 hydrogen bonds, making high-GC-content RNA structures more resistant to the effects of high temperatures.
More recently, it has been proved that the most stabilizing factor of thermal stability of double stranded nucleic acids is actually due to the base stackings of adjacent bases, rather than the number of hydrogen bonds between the bases.There is more favorable stacking energy for G:C pairs because of the relative positions of exocyclic groups than in the A:U pairs. Additionally, there is a correlation between the order in which the bases stack and thermal stability.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Yakovchuk|first=Peter|last2=Protozanova|first2=Ekaterina|last3=Frank-Kamenetskii|first3=Maxim D.|date=2006|title=Base-stacking and base-pairing contributions into thermal stability of the DNA double helix|journal=Nucleic Acids Research|volume=34|issue=2|pages=564–574|doi=10.1093/nar/gkj454|issn=0305-1048|pmc=1360284|pmid=16449200}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Determination ==
GC content is usually expressed as a percentage value, but sometimes as a ratio (called '''G+C ratio''' or '''GC-ratio'''). GC-content percentage is calculated as&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author =Madigan,MT. and Martinko JM. | title = Brock  biology of microorganisms| edition = 10th | publisher =Pearson-Prentice Hall | year = 2003| isbn = 978-84-205-3679-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\cfrac{G+C}{A+T+G+C}\times100%&lt;/math&gt;

whereas the AT/GC ratio is calculated as&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biochem.northwestern.edu/holmgren/Glossary/Definitions/Def-A/A+T_G+C_ratio.html Definition of GC-ratio on Northwestern University, IL, USA]&lt;/ref&gt;  
:&lt;math&gt;\cfrac{A+T}{G+C}&lt;/math&gt; .

The GC-content percentages as well as GC-ratio can be measured by several means, but one of the simplest methods is to measure what is called the [[DNA melting|melting temperature]] of the [[DNA]] [[double helix]] using [[spectrophotometry]]. The [[absorbance]] of [[DNA]] at a [[wavelength]] of 260 [[Nanometer|nm]] increases fairly sharply when the double-stranded [[DNA]] separates into two single strands when sufficiently heated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Wilhelm J, Pingoud A, Hahn M |title=Real-time PCR-based method for the estimation of genome sizes |journal=Nucleic Acids Res. |volume=31 |issue=10 |page=e56 |date=May 2003 |pmid=12736322 |pmc=156059  |doi=10.1093/nar/gng056}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most commonly used protocol for determining GC ratios uses [[flow cytometry]] for large number of samples.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Vinogradov AE |title=Measurement by flow cytometry of genomic AT/GC ratio and genome size |journal=Cytometry |volume=16 |issue=1 |pages=34–40 |date=May 1994 |pmid=7518377 |doi=10.1002/cyto.990160106 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In alternative manner, if the DNA or RNA molecule under investigation has been [[sequenced]] then the GC-content can be accurately calculated by simple arithmetic or by using the [http://www.basic.northwestern.edu/biotools/oligocalc.html free online GC calculator].

== Genomic content ==
=== Within-genome variation === 
The GC ratio within a genome is found to be markedly variable. These variations in GC ratio within the genomes of more complex organisms result in a mosaic-like formation with islet regions called [[Isochore (genetics)|isochores]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Bernardi G |title=Isochores and the evolutionary genomics of vertebrates |journal=Gene |volume=241 |issue=1 |pages=3–17 |date=January 2000 |pmid=10607893 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0378-1119(99)00485-0 |doi=10.1016/S0378-1119(99)00485-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; This results in the variations in staining intensity in the [[chromosomes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Furey TS, Haussler D |title=Integration of the cytogenetic map with the draft human genome sequence |journal=Hum. Mol. Genet. |volume=12 |issue=9 |pages=1037–44 |date=May 2003 |pmid=12700172 |url=http://hmg.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=12700172 |doi=10.1093/hmg/ddg113}}&lt;/ref&gt; GC-rich isochores include in them many protein coding genes, and thus determination of ratio of these specific regions contributes in mapping gene-rich regions of the genome.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Sumner AT, de la Torre J, Stuppia L |title=The distribution of genes on chromosomes: a cytological approach |journal=J. Mol. Evol. |volume=37 |issue=2 |pages=117–22 |date=August 1993 |pmid=8411200 |doi=10.1007/BF02407346 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Aïssani B, Bernardi G |title=CpG islands, genes and isochores in the genomes of vertebrates |journal=Gene |volume=106 |issue=2 |pages=185–95 |date=October 1991 |pmid=1937049 |doi=10.1016/0378-1119(91)90198-K }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Coding sequences ===
Within a long region of genomic sequence, genes are often characterised by having a higher GC-content in contrast to the background GC-content for the entire genome. Evidence of GC ratio with that of length of the [[coding region]] of a [[gene]] has shown that the length of the coding sequence is directly proportional to higher G+C content.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Pozzoli U, Menozzi G, Fumagalli M |title=Both selective and neutral processes drive GC content evolution in the human genome |journal=BMC Evol. Biol. |volume=8 |pages=99 |year=2008 |pmid=18371205 |pmc=2292697 |doi=10.1186/1471-2148-8-99 |url=http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/99|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; This has been pointed to the fact that the [[stop codon]] has a bias towards A and T nucleotides, and, thus, the shorter the sequence the higher the AT bias.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Wuitschick JD, Karrer KM |title=Analysis of genomic G + C content, codon usage, initiator codon context and translation termination sites in ''Tetrahymena thermophila'' |journal=J. Eukaryot. Microbiol. |volume=46 |issue=3 |pages=239–47 |year=1999 |pmid=10377985 |doi=10.1111/j.1550-7408.1999.tb05120.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Comparison of more than 1,000 [[orthologous]] genes in mammals showed marked within-genome variations of the [[codon|third-codon position]] GC content, with a range from less than 30% to more than 80%.&lt;ref name="Romiguier2010"/&gt;

=== Among-genome variation === 
GC content is found to be variable with different organisms, the process of which is envisaged to be contributed to by variation in [[Gene-centered view of evolution|selection]], mutational bias, and biased recombination-associated [[DNA repair]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Birdsell JA |title=Integrating genomics, bioinformatics, and classical genetics to study the effects of recombination on genome evolution |journal=Mol. Biol. Evol. |volume=19 |issue=7 |pages=1181–97 |date=1 July 2002|pmid=12082137 |url=http://mbe.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=12082137 |doi=10.1093/oxfordjournals.molbev.a004176|citeseerx=10.1.1.337.1535 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The average GC-content in human genomes ranges from 35% to 60% across 100-Kb fragments, with a mean of 46.1%.&lt;ref name="Romiguier2010"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Romiguier|first=Jonathan|last2=Ranwez|first2=Vincent|last3=Douzery|first3=Emmanuel J. P.|last4=Galtier|first4=Nicolas|date=2010-08-01|title=Contrasting GC-content dynamics across 33 mammalian genomes: Relationship with life-history traits and chromosome sizes|url=http://genome.cshlp.org/content/20/8/1001|journal=Genome Research|language=en|volume=20|issue=8|pages=1001–1009|doi=10.1101/gr.104372.109|issn=1088-9051|pmc=2909565|pmid=20530252}}&lt;/ref&gt; The GC-content of [[Yeast]] (''[[Saccharomyces cerevisiae]]'') is 38%,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/entrez?db=genomeprj&amp;cmd=Retrieve&amp;dopt=Overview&amp;list_uids=128 Whole genome data of ''Saccharomyces cerevisiae'' on NCBI]&lt;/ref&gt; and that of another common [[model organism]], thale cress (''[[Arabidopsis thaliana]]''), is 36%.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/entrez?db=genomeprj&amp;cmd=Retrieve&amp;dopt=Overview&amp;list_uids=116 Whole genome data of '' Arabidopsis thaliana'' on NCBI]&lt;/ref&gt; Because of the nature of the [[genetic code]], it is virtually impossible for an organism to have a genome with a GC-content approaching either 0% or 100%. However, a species with an extremely low GC-content is ''[[Plasmodium falciparum]]'' (GC% = ~20%),&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/entrez?db=genomeprj&amp;cmd=Retrieve&amp;dopt=Overview&amp;list_uids=148 Whole genome data of ''Plasmodium falciparum'' on NCBI]&lt;/ref&gt; and it is usually common to refer to such examples as being AT-rich instead of GC-poor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Musto H, Cacciò S, Rodríguez-Maseda H, Bernardi G |title=Compositional constraints in the extremely GC-poor genome of ''Plasmodium falciparum'' |journal=Mem. Inst. Oswaldo Cruz |volume=92 |issue=6 |pages=835–41 |year=1997 |pmid=9566216 |url=http://www.scielo.br/pdf/mioc/v92n6/3431.pdf |doi=10.1590/S0074-02761997000600020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several mammalian species (e.g., [[shrew]], [[microbat]], [[tenrec]], [[rabbit]]) have independently undergone a marked increase in the GC-content of their genes. These GC-content changes are correlated with species [[Phenotypic trait|life-history traits]] (e.g., body mass or longevity) and genome size,&lt;ref name="Romiguier2010"/&gt; and might be linked to a molecular phenomenon called the GC-biased [[gene conversion]].&lt;ref name=Duret2009&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Duret L, Galtier N |title=Biased gene conversion and the evolution of mammalian genomic landscapes |journal=Annu Rev Genom Hum Genet |volume=10 |pages=285–311 |year=2009 |pmid=19630562 |doi=10.1146/annurev-genom-082908-150001 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==  Applications ==
=== Molecular biology ===
In [[polymerase chain reaction]] (PCR) experiments, the GC-content of [[primer (molecular biology)|primers]] are used to predict their [[Polymerase chain reaction|annealing temperature]] to the template DNA. A higher GC-content level indicates a relatively higher melting temperature.

=== Systematics  ===
The [[species problem]] in prokaryotic taxonomy has led to various suggestions in classifying bacteria, and the ''ad hoc committee on reconciliation of approaches to bacterial systematics'' has recommended use of GC ratios in higher level hierarchical classification.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1099/00207713-37-4-463 |author=Wayne LG |title=Report of the ad hoc committee on reconciliation of approaches to bacterial systematic |journal=International Journal of Systematic Bacteriology |volume=37 |issue=4 |pages=463–4 |year=1987|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the [[Actinobacteria]] are characterised as "high GC-content [[bacterium|bacteria]]".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Taxonomy/Browser/wwwtax.cgi?mode=Tree&amp;id=1760&amp;lvl=3&amp;lin=f&amp;keep=1&amp;srchmode=1&amp;unlock Taxonomy browser on NCBI]&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[Streptomyces coelicolor]]'' A3(2), GC content is 72%.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/entrez?db=genomeprj&amp;cmd=Retrieve&amp;dopt=Overview&amp;list_uids=242 Whole genome data of ''Streptomyces coelicolor'' A3(2) on NCBI]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3313">{{For|the theatre director|Hans Hollmann (director)}}

'''Hans Erich (Eric) Hollmann''' (4 November 1899 &amp;ndash; 19 November 1960) was a German electronic specialist who made several breakthroughs in the development of [[History of radar|radar]].

Hollmann was born in [[Solingen]], [[Germany]]. He became interested in radio and even as a teenager subscribed to the technical magazines of the day. Late in [[World War I]] he became a prisoner of war of the French and did not return to Germany until 1920. He then studied at the Technical University at [[Darmstadt]] until he received his doctorate in 1928.

Hollmann's doctoral research included the development of an ultra-short-wave transmitter and receiver for centimetre and decimetre waves. This gained the attention of ''Telefunken'', and ultimately led to their development of the first microwave telecommunication system.

In 1930 Hollmann moved to the [[Fraunhofer Institute for Telecommunications|Heinrich-Hertz Institute for Oscillatory Research]] in Berlin. There he continued studies in microwaves and cathode ray tubes and also worked on the ionosphere research and radio astronomy. In 1933 Hollmann became a lecturer at the Technical University in Berlin.

In January 1934, Hans-Karl von Willisen and Paul-Günther Erbslöh started a company called [[Gesellschaft für elektroakustische und mechanische Apparate]] (GEMA). With Hollmann as a consultant, GEMA built a system using interference detection in the autumn of 1934. It operated at 50&amp;nbsp;cm wavelength and could detect ships up to 10&amp;nbsp;km distance. By 1935, they used pulse-modulation, allowing measurement of range (distance to the target), and developed the technology into two applications. For naval use, the ''[[Seetakt]]'' system used a wavelength of 80&amp;nbsp;cm. A land based version at 120&amp;nbsp;cm wavelength was also developed as ''[[Freya]]''.

[[Telefunken]] set up a radar business in 1933 based on Hollmann's work and developed a much shorter-range gun-laying system called ''[[Würzburg radar|Würzburg]]''. During [[World War II]], ''Freya'' and ''Würzburg'' worked in pairs. ''Freya'' would spot the incoming aircraft while the ''Würzburg'' calculated the distance and height.

In 1935, Hollmann wrote two books on microwaves, ''Physics and Technique of Ultra-short Waves'' and ''Seeing with Electromagnetic Waves'', which were the inspiration for the development of centimetre radar in other countries despite some [[censorship]] of their contents.

During the war he supervised many research institutes in occupied countries and saved many scientists from being deported to Germany. His home and his laboratory in Berlin were destroyed during the war. After the war he was not allowed to work on microwaves but he turned his attention to a wide range of other fields in electronics. He eventually accepted an offer from the US Government to work in [[California]].

He was married to Gisela Schimmelbusch and had three children. He died in [[Los Angeles]] in 1960.

Named by [[aviator|pilots]] during the [[World War II|Second World War]], the recurring position of the thunderstorm made it a navigational beacon for pilots and [[mariner]]s in the region.

[[File:Ice III phase diagram.svg|thumb|Phase diagram of water, showing the region where ice III is stable.]]
'''Ice III''' is a form of solid matter which consists of [[tetragonal]] [[Crystal|crystalline]] [[ice]], formed by cooling [[water]] down to {{nowrap|250 [[Kelvin|K]]}} at {{nowrap|300 [[Pascal (unit)|MPa]]}}. It is the least dense of the high-pressure water [[phase (matter)|phases]], with a [[density]] of {{nowrap|1160 kg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;}} (at 350 MPa). The proton-ordered form of {{nowrap|ice III}} is [[ice IX]].

Ordinary water ice is known as {{nowrap|[[ice Ih|ice I&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt;]]}},  (in the [[Percy Williams Bridgman|Bridgman]] nomenclature).  Different types of ice, from [[ice II]] to [[ice XVI]], have been created in the laboratory at different temperatures and pressures.

Psychologists study phenomena such as [[perception]], [[cognition]], [[emotion]], [[personality psychology|personality]], [[behavior]], and [[interpersonal relationships]]. Some, especially [[depth psychology|depth psychologists]], also study the [[unconscious mind]].

'''Kappa Epsilon''' ('''ΚΕ''') is a professional [[pharmacy]] fraternity founded by [[Zada Mary Cooper|Zada M. Cooper]] on May 13, 1921.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |jstor=41111877 |title=Zada Mary Cooper: Grand and Glorious Lady of Pharmacy |last=Henderson |first=Metta Lou |work=Pharmacy in History |pages=77–84 |publisher=American Institute of the History of Pharmacy |volume=40 |number=2/3 |year=1998 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  It was founded with the purpose of uniting female pharmacy students in an era when women were a minority in the profession.  Today, KE has 43 collegiate chapters and 10 alumni chapters.  Over 20,000 women and men have been initiated into ΚΕ since its founding.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kappaepsilon.org/history.shtml KappaEpsilon.org]&lt;/ref&gt;

Kappa Epsilon's National Project is the promotion of [[breast cancer]] awareness.  Many ΚΕ chapters participate in the [[Race for the Cure]] or [[Relay For Life]].  KE chapters are also encouraged to promote awareness of other women's health issues such as [[osteoporosis]].  KE's recently added the Pharmacy Career Opportunity Recruitment Project (Pharm-CORP) to their National Project.  Pharm-CORP works to introduce pharmacy careers to middle and high school aged students and encourages them to excel in math and the sciences.

Kappa Epsilon sponsors one scholarship and one fellowship.  The Zada Cooper Scholarship, named for the fraternity's founder, is given to five students every year.  The Nellie Wakeman Fellowship is given to a member in his/her last year of pharmacy school who wishes to pursue graduate study.  For both awards, the recipient must be a fraternity member in good standing.

Every two years, the fraternity holds a convention where national officers are elected and collegiate and alumni members can network.

The official colors of Kappa Epsilon are only [[Red]] and [[White]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4266">The '''Keystone virus''' is a mosquito-borne [[virus]] which can infect mammals.  It was first discovered in animals in the [[Florida]] area, where it is spread in part by local species of ''[[Aedes]]'' [[mosquito]]es. In 1964, a case of human infection, producing minor symptoms of a rash and fever, was circumstantially diagnosed.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.floridahealth.gov/diseases-and-conditions/disease-reporting-and-management/disease-reporting-and-surveillance/_documents/mosquito-guide-2013.pdf Surveillance and Control of Selected Mosquito-borne Diseases in Florida — 2013&lt;br/&gt;"The only recorded human case of Keystone virus illness occurred in a young child from Sarasota in 1964."&lt;/ref&gt; Conclusive laboratory demonstration of the virus in humans was first obtained and reported in 2018.&lt;ref name="AM"&gt;Ashley May: "Keystone virus makes first jump from mosquitoes to humans with confirmed case in Florida teen, study says," https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation-now/2018/06/22/first-report-human-keystone-virus-found-florida-teen/725460002/, updated 1:20 p.m. ET June 25, 2018; "Authors said this was the first case of the virus in humans, but the Florida Department of Health told USA TODAY that a young child from Sarasota had the virus in 1964."&lt;/ref&gt;

==The virus==
The Keystone virus was first discovered in mosquitoes in the [[Keystone, Florida|Keystone]] area of [[Tampa, Florida]] in 1964, based on [[antigen]]ic evidence from specimens caught in 1963.&lt;ref&gt;http://aem.asm.org/content/19/4/557.full.pdf Arbovirus Identification by an Agar-Gel
Diffusion Technique&lt;/ref&gt; The virus has been subsequently observed along the eastern and southern coastline of the [[United States]], from Boston through Texas.&lt;ref&gt;[https://academic.oup.com/jme/article-abstract/12/5/537/972890?redirectedFrom=fulltext The Ecology and Behavior of ''Aedes atlanticus'' D. &amp; K. and Other Species with Reference to Keystone Virus in the Houston Area, Texas]&lt;/ref&gt; In small mammals it can produce symptoms of [[encephalitis]].

The first laboratory isolation of the virus from a human case occurred in Florida in 2016, and was reported in 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://academic.oup.com/cid/advance-article-abstract/doi/10.1093/cid/ciy485/5035220?redirectedFrom=fulltext|author=John A Lednicky, et al|title=Keystone Virus Isolated from a Florida Teenager with Rash and Subjective Fever: Another Endemic Arbovirus in the Southeastern United States?|journal=Clinical Infectious Diseases|doi=10.1093/cid/ciy485|date=June 9, 2018|accessdate=June 22, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Identification took almost two years after the case actually occurred, when blood samples taken from the subject in 2016 were analyzed retrospectively by researchers studying the incidence of [[Zika virus]] in the Florida population.

The ''[[Aedes atlanticus]]'' mosquito is a demonstrated [[Vector (epidemiology)|vector]].  The virus transmits [[transstadial transmission|transstadial]]ly through the different stages of the insect's life: A female mosquito may lay eggs carrying the virus, which hatch into infected larvae, eventually maturing into adults that can infect mammals while injecting their [[anti-coagulant]] saliva during a bite.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20017 Ecology of Keystone virus, a transovarially maintained arbovirus]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Krennerite''' is an orthorhombic [[gold]] [[tellurium|telluride]] [[mineral]] which can contain variable amounts of  [[silver]] in the structure. The formula is AuTe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; varying to (Au&lt;sub&gt;0.8&lt;/sub&gt;,Ag&lt;sub&gt;0.2&lt;/sub&gt;)Te&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Both of the chemically similar gold-silver tellurides, [[calaverite]] and [[sylvanite]], are in the [[monoclinic]] crystal system, whereas krennerite is orthorhombic.

The color varies from silver-white to brass-yellow. It has a [[specific gravity]] of 8.62 and a [[mohs hardness|hardness]] of 2.5. It occurs in high temperature, [[hydrothermal]] environments. 

Krennerite was discovered in 1878 near the village of [[Certeju de Sus|Săcărâmb]], [[Romania]], and first described by the [[Kingdom of Hungary|Hungarian]] [[mineralogist]] [[Joseph Krenner]] (1839–1920).&lt;ref name=mindat/&gt;

'''Martín Cárdenas Hermosa''' (November 12, 1899 – February 14, 1973) was a [[Bolivia]]n [[botanist]]. Cárdenas is considered one of the most important botanists in Bolivia's history.
He is responsible for recording some 6,500 species of plants in his native country.

==Biography==
In 1918, he graduated as a Bachelor in Biological Sciences and Letters and secured a scholarship to continue his studies at the [[Instituto Normal Superior]] in [[La Paz]], where he specialized in Biology and Chemistry. He graduated in 1922. On his vacations in [[Cochabamba]] he went for long walks by gathering plants, of which he soon recorded their characteristics in books and journals at the Municipal Library of La Paz. At that time, Cardenas had met Swedish botanist [[Erik Asplund]], who had also shown a keen interest in studying the plants in Bolivia. Asplund played an important role in enhancing his knowledge of botany and was an early mentor for him.

By May 1922, Cárdenas was already professor in the Special Natural Sciences and Chemistry, being an auxiliary senior instructor and later obtained a title at the ''Instituto Normal Superior de La Paz''.

In his career, over a 40 or 50-year period, Cárdenas classified 6,500 species of the flora of Bolivia, and described 180 new species of [[cactus]], with 16 varieties. He also registered 26 types of ''[[Solanum tuberosum]]'' with six varieties.

In 1951, he was awarded the [[Mary Soper Pope Memorial Award]] in botany.&lt;ref name=cranbrook&gt;[http://www.cranbrook.edu/sites/default/files/ftpimages/120/misc/misc_35342.pdf "Cranbrook Institute of Science Director's Papers"]. Cranbrook website. Retrieved Dec. 27, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2577">In [[hydrography]], the '''Navigation Surface''' paradigm represents an alternative to traditional approaches to manage [[bathymetry|bathymetric data]] by creating bathymetric databases that can be used to generate high-resolution navigation aids and other applications.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite thesis|type=Masters|title=The Navigation Surface: A Multipurpose Bathymetric Database|last1=Smith|first1=Shepard|date=2003|publisher=[[University of New Hampshire]] |url=http://ccom.unh.edu/publications/navigation-surface-multipurpose-bathymetric-database |location=Durham, NH|pages=|accessdate=16 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The paradigm also provides methods to manipulate the data to create products for various applications (e.g., [[thematic map]]s for [[marine geology]],[[acoustic seabed classification]] and [[marine biology]]).{{citation needed|date= June 2018}}

== History ==

Recent technological developments in [[hydrography]] (e.g., large adoption of [[multibeam echosounder]] and [[electronic navigational chart]]s) have pushed [[hydrographic office|hydrographic organizations]] to adopt a new production paradigm centered on gridded surfaces rather than sounding-based workflow and products.&lt;ref name="titley"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Titley |first1=David |title=Implementation of Navigation Surface |journal=Hydro International |date=26 June 2009 |url=https://www.hydro-international.com/content/article/implementation-of-navigation-surface |accessdate=17 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Based on such a shift, the concept of navigation surface was introduced in 2003 to provide a [[seafloor]] model at the best resolution that the data support. Depth values for nautical charting are then derived by [[cartographic generalization|generalization]] of the available gridded surfaces. In addition, a quality assessment for each grid node of the navigation surface is created through an uncertainty layer.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

The Open Navigation Surface (ONS) project designed a free, [[open-source software|open-source code]] library to manage (read/write) the information required to create a Navigation Surface. The implementation of these requirements is represented by the [[Bathymetric Attributed Grid]] data format.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Open Navigation Surface project |url=http://www.opennavsurf.org/index.html |accessdate=16 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In professional sports, '''notational analysis''' is the study of movement patterns, strategy and tactics in team sports. Successful patterns of play can be identified and used in subsequent matches. Notational analysis has a history in [[dance notation|dance]] and [[music notation]]. Notational analysis is a way that critical events in a performance can be quantified in a consistent and reliable manner.

In notational analysis, no change in performance of any kind will take place without feedback. The role of feedback is central in the performance improvement process, and by inference, so is the need for accuracy and precision of such feedback. The provision of this accurate and precise feedback can only be facilitated if performance and practice is subjected to a vigorous process of analysis.

Augmented feedback has traditionally been provided by subjective observations, made during performance by the coaches, in the belief that they can accurately report on the critical elements of performance without any observation aids. Several studies not only contradict this belief, but also suggest that the recall abilities of experienced coaches are little better than those of novices, and that even with observational training, coaches' recall abilities improved only slightly. Furthermore, research in applied psychology has suggested that these recall abilities are also influenced by factors that include the observer's motives and beliefs. The coach is not a passive perceiver of information, and as such his or her perception of events is selective and constructive, not simply a copying process. This importance of feedback to performance improvement, and the limitations of coaches' recall abilities alluded to above, implies a requirement for objective data upon which to base augmented feedback, and the main methods of "objectifying" this data involve the use of video / notational analysis (Hughes and Franks, 1997 p.&amp;nbsp;11).

Coaches have been aware, consciously or unconsciously, of these needs for accuracy of feedback and have been using simple data gathering systems for decades. More recently, sports scientists have been using notational analysis systems to answer fundamental questions about game play and performance in sport. An early work, over some decades, on analysis of soccer was picked up by the then Director of Coaching at the [[Football Association]], and this had a profound effect on the patterns of play in British football – the adoption of the 'long ball' game. Generally, the first publications in Britain of the research process by notational analysis of sport were in the mid-1970s, so as a discipline it is one of the more recent to be embraced by sports science. The publication of a number of notation systems in racket sports provided a fund of ideas used by other analysts. Because of the growth and development of sports science as an academic discipline, a number of scientists began using and extending the simple hand notation techniques that had served for decades. This also coincided with the introduction of personal computers, which transformed all aspects of data gathering in sports science. Currently hand and computerised notation systems are both used to equal extents by working analysts, although the use of computer databases to collate hand notated data post-event makes the analyses much more powerful.

The applications of notation have been defined as:
# tactical evaluation,
# technical evaluation,
# analysis of movement,
# development of a database and modelling, and
# for educational use with both coaches and players.

Most pieces of research using notation, or indeed any practical applications working directly with coaches and athletes, will span more than one of these purposes.

== The applications of notation ==
===Tactical evaluation===
The definition of tactical patterns of play in sports has been a profitable source of work for a number of researchers. The maturation of tactics can be analysed at different levels of development of a specific sport, usually by means of a cross-sectional design. The different tactics used at each level of development within a sport will inevitably depend upon technical development, physical maturation and other variables. The 'maturation models' have very important implications for coaching methods and directions at the different stages of development in each of the racket sports. These tactical 'norms' or 'models', based both upon technique and tactics, demonstrate how the different applications, defined above, can overlap.

Sanderson and Way (1977) used symbols to notate seventeen different strokes, as well as incorporating court plans for recording accurate positional information. The system took an estimated 5–8 hours of use and practise before an operator was sufficiently skilful to record a full match actually during the game. In an average squash match there are about 1000 shots, an analyst using this system will gather over 30 pages of data per match. Not only were the patterns of rally-ending shots (the Nth shot of the rally) examined in detail, but also those shots that preceded the end shot, (N-1) to a winner or error, and the shots that preceded those, (N-2) to a winner or error. In this way the rally ending patterns of play were analysed. Not surprisingly, processing the data for just one match could take as long as 40 hours of further work. The major emphasis of this system was on the gathering of information concerning `play patterns' as well as the comprehensive collection of descriptive match data. Sanderson felt that `suggestive' symbols were better than codes, being easier for the operator to learn and remember. The main disadvantages of this system, as with all longhand systems, was the time taken to learn the system and the large amounts of data generated, which in turn needed so much time to process it.

The 1980s and 1990s saw researchers struggling to harness the developing technology to ease the problems inherent in gathering and interpreting large amounts of complex data. Hughes (1987) modified the method of Sanderson and Way so that the hand-notated data could be processed on a mainframe computer. Eventually, the manual method was modified so that a match could be notated in-match at courtside directly into a microcomputer. This work was then extended to examine the patterns of play of male squash players at recreational, county and elite levels, thus creating empirical models of performance, although the principles of data stabilisation were not thoroughly understood at the time. This form of empirical modelling of tactical profiles is fundamental to a large amount of the published work in notational analysis. By comparing the patterns of play of successful and unsuccessful teams or players in elite competitions, world cup competitions, for example, enables the definition of those performance indicators that differentiate between the two groups. This research template has been used in a number of sports to highlight the tactical parameters that determine success, and it has been extended in tennis to compare the patterns of play that are successful on the different surfaces on which the major tournaments are played.

Most of the examples for tactical applications of notation could appear in the other sections of direct applications of notational analysis, but their initial aims were linked with analysis of tactics. The interesting theme that is emerging, from some of the recent research, is that the tactical models that are defined are changing with time, as players become fitter, stronger, faster, bigger (think of the changes in rugby union since professionalisation in 1996), and the equipment changes – for example, the rackets in all the sports have become lighter and more powerful. Over a period of less than 15 years the length of rallies in squash, for elite players, has decreased from about 20 shots, to about 12 shots per rally. An excellent review (Croucher, 1996) of the application of strategies using notational analysis of different sports outlines the problems, advantages and disadvantages associated with this function.

===Technical evaluation===
To define quantitatively where technique fails or excels has very practical uses for coaches, in particular, and also for sports scientists aiming to analyse performance at different levels of development of athletes.

Winners and errors are powerful indicators of technical competence in racket sports and have often been used in research in notational analysis of net-wall games. It has been found that, for all standards of play in squash, if the winner: error ratio for a particular player in a match was greater than one, then that player usually won. (This was achieved with English scoring and a 19-inch tin). Although this ratio is a good index of technique, it would be better used with data for both players, and the ratios should not be simplified nor decimalised. Rally end distributions, winners and errors in the different position cells across the court, have often been used to define technical strengths and weaknesses. This use of these distributions as indicators is valid as long as the overall distribution of shots across the court is evenly balanced. This even distribution of shots rarely occurs in any net or wall game. Dispersions of winners and errors should be normalised with respect to the totals of shots from those cells. It would be more accurate to represent the winner, or error, frequency, from particular position cells, as a ratio to the total number of shots from those cells.

Similarly, performance indicators such as shots are insufficient and need to be expressed with more detail, for example shot to goal ratios (soccer). Even these, powerful as they are, need to be viewed with caution and perhaps integrated with some measure of shooting opportunities? In rugby union, simple numbers of rucks and mauls won by teams may not give a clear impression of the match, the ratio of 'rucks won' to 'rucks initiated' is a more powerful measure of performance. This too could be improved by some measure of how quickly the ball was won in critical areas of the pitch?

Many coaches seek the template of tactical play at the highest level for preparation and training of both elite players and/or teams, and also for those developing players who aspire to reach the highest position. Particular databases, aimed at specific individuals or teams, can also be used to prepare in anticipation of potential opponents for match play. This modelling of technical attainment has been replicated in many sports and form the basis of preparation at the highest levels by the sports science support teams.

== Movement analysis ==
Reilly and Thomas (1976) recorded and analysed the intensity and extent of discrete activities during match play in field soccer. With a combination of hand notation and the use of an audio tape recorder, they analysed in detail the movements of English first division soccer players. They were able to specify work-rates of the different positions, distances covered in a game and the percentage time of each position in each of the different ambulatory classifications. Reilly has continually added to this base of data enabling him to clearly define the specific physiological demands in not just soccer, but all the football codes. This piece of work by Reilly and Thomas has become a standard against which other similar research projects can compare their results and procedures, and it has been replicated by many other researchers in many different sports.

Modern tracking systems have taken the chore out of gathering movement data, which was the most time-consuming application of notational analysis, and advanced computer graphics make the data presentation very simple to understand. Modelling movement has created a better understanding of the respective sports and has enabled specific training programmes to be developed to improve the movement patterns, and fitness, of the respective athletes.

== Development of a database and modelling ==
Teams and performers often demonstrate a stereotypical way of playing and these are idiosyncratic models, which include positive and negative aspects of performance. Patterns of play will begin to establish over a period of time but the greater the database then the more accurate the model. An established model provides for the opportunity to compare single performance against it. The modelling of competitive sport is an informative analytic technique because it directs the attention of the modeller to the critical aspects of data that delineate successful performance. The modeller searches for an underlying signature of sport performance, which is a reliable predictor of future sport behaviour. Stochastic models have not yet, to our knowledge, been used further to investigate sport at the behavioural level of analysis. However, the modelling procedure is readily applicable to other sports and could lead to useful and interesting results.

Once notational analysis systems are used to collect amounts of data that are sufficiently large enough to define 'norms' of behaviour, then all the ensuing outcomes of the work are based upon the principles of modelling. It is an implicit assumption in notational analysis that in presenting a performance profile of a team or an individual that a 'normative profile' has been achieved. Inherently this implies that all the variables that are to be analysed and compared have all stabilised. Most researchers assume that this will have happened if they analyse enough performances. But how many is enough? In the literature there are large differences in sample sizes.

These problems have very serious direct outcomes for the analyst working with coaches and athletes, both in practical and theoretical applications. It is vital that when analysts are presenting profiles of performance that they are definitely stable otherwise any statement about that performance is spurious. The whole process of analysis and feedback of performance has many practical difficulties. The performance analyst working in this applied environment will experience strict deadlines and acute time pressures defined by the date of the next tournament, the schedule and the draw. The need then is to provide coaches with accurate information on as many of the likely opposition players, or teams, in the amount of time available. This may be achieved by the instigation of a library of team and/or player analysis files, which can be extended over time and receive frequent updating. Player files must be regularly updated by adding analyses from recent matches to the database held on each player.

Finally, some scientists have considered the use of a number of sophisticated techniques, such as neural networks, chaos theory, fuzzy logic and catastrophe theory, for recognizing structures, or processes, within sports contests. Each of these system descriptions, while incomplete, may assist in our understanding of the behaviours that form sports contests. Furthermore, these descriptions for sports contests need not be exclusive of each other, and a hybrid type of description (or model) may be appropriate in the future, a suggestion that remains only a point of conjecture at this time.

== Educational applications ==
It is accepted that feedback, if presented at the correct time and in the correct quantity, plays a great part in the learning of new skills and the enhancement of performance. Recent research, however, has shown that the more objective or quantitative the feedback, the greater effect it has on performance. However, in order to gauge the exact effect of feedback alone, complete control conditions would be needed in order to minimise the effect of other external variables, which is by definition impossible in real competitive environments. This experimental design is also made more difficult because working with elite athletes precludes large numbers of subjects.

Hughes and Robertson (1997) were using notation systems as an adjunct to a spectrum of tactical models that they have created for squash. The hand notation systems are used by the Welsh national youth squads, the actual notation being completed by the players, for the players. It is believed that in this way the tactical awareness of the players, doing the notation, are heightened by their administration of these systems. This type of practical educational use of notation systems has been used in a number of teams sports, soccer, rugby union, rugby league, basketball, cricket, and so on, by players in the squads, substitutes, injured players, as a way of enhancing their understanding of their sport, as well as providing statistics on their team.

'''Orbital Express''' was a space mission managed by the [[United States]] [[Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency]] (DARPA) and a team led by engineers at [[NASA]]'s [[Marshall Space Flight Center]] (MSFC). The Orbital Express program was aimed at developing "a safe and cost-effective approach to autonomously service satellites in orbit."&lt;ref&gt;

The system consisted of two [[spacecraft]]: the [[ASTRO (satellite)|ASTRO]] servicing satellite, and a prototype modular next-generation serviceable satellite; [[NEXTSat]]. 
The mission launched from [[Cape Canaveral Air Force Station]] on March 8, 2007, aboard an [[Atlas V]] [[expendable launch vehicle]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://science.nasa.gov/headlines/y2007/05mar_nohands.htm | title = Look Ma!

== Program management and contractors ==
[[File:Orbital_Express_contractors.png|thumb|right|Orbital Express major subsystem contractors]]

The Orbital Express program was managed by the Tactical Technology Office (TTO), one of the six technical offices in DARPA.&lt;ref&gt;

ASTRO was developed by [[Boeing Integrated Defense Systems]], which included the Orbital Express Demonstration Manipulator System (OEDMS) developed by [[MacDonald, Dettwiler and Associates]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.darpa.mil/workarea/downloadasset.aspx?id=2147486057 | title = Autonomous Robotic Operations for On-Orbit Satellite Servicing | publisher = MDA Corporation | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20130609222123/http://www.darpa.mil/WorkArea/DownloadAsset.aspx?id=2147486057 | archivedate = 2013-06-09 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; and NEXTSat was developed by [[Ball Aerospace &amp; Technologies Corp.]]
NASA's involvement was through the Automated Systems and Automated Rendezvous and Docking Division of the Engineering Directorate at MSFC. The MSFC Engineering Directorate also managed the Advanced Video Guidance System (AVGS) for Orbital Express project.&lt;ref&gt;

The refueling mechanism was designed, developed and produced by VACCO Industries. The docking mechanism, as well as the launch adapter, were designed, developed and produced by Sierra Nevada Corporation (SNC) Space Systems.

== Goals ==
[[image:Orbital Express 2.png|thumb|left|Orbital Express: ASTRO and NEXTSat]]

The project hoped to demonstrate several satellite servicing operations and technologies including [[Space rendezvous|rendezvous]], proximity operations and [[Orbital station-keeping|station keeping]], capture, [[Spacecraft Docking and Berthing Mechanisms|docking]], fluid transfer (specifically, [[hydrazine]] on this mission), and ORU (Orbit Replaceable Unit) transfer. A prime military mission would be to refuel reconnaissance satellites so they can improve coverage, increase surprise and be more survivable.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aviationweek.com/aw/generic/story_generic.jsp?channel=awst&amp;id=news/aw060506p1.xml Orbital Express To Test Full Autonomy for On-Orbit Service], [[Aviation Week]], June 4, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

The fluid (fuel) and ORU (battery) transfers were completed successfully at the lowest levels of spacecraft autonomy. Subsequent transfers over a three-month period were intended to demonstrate greater autonomy.&lt;ref&gt;

Were these goals achieved? --&gt;

== Robotics: the Demonstration Manipulator System (OEDMS) ==


The Orbital Express Demonstration Manipulator System (OEDMS), provided by MDA Corp., was the mission’s integrated robotics solution. It consisted primarily of a 6-DOF rotary joint robotic arm, its flight avionics (the Manipulator Control Unit or MCU) and arm vision system, two On-Orbit Replaceable Units (ORUs) and their spacecraft attachment interfaces, a visual target and grapple fixture installed on NEXTSat, and the Manipulator [[Ground Segment]].

The OEDMS was mounted on the ASTRO. It was used to capture and service the NEXTSat, the client satellite provided by Ball Aerospace. Using a robotic arm on-orbit, the Orbital Express mission demonstrated autonomous capture of a fully unconstrained free-flying client satellite, autonomous transfer of a functional battery ORU between two spacecraft, and autonomous transfer of a functional computer ORU. These operations were executed as part of mission scenarios that demonstrated complete sequences of autonomous rendezvous, capture, berthing and ORU transfer.

All robotic operations were scripted prior to execution and performed autonomously as part of increasingly complex mission scenarios. The arm was commanded to perform its operations by either direct command from the ground, or autonomously by the ASTRO Mission Manager software. Scenarios in the early phases of flight operations incorporated a number of Authority to Proceed (ATP) pause points, which required a signal to be sent from the ground to authorize the ASTRO Mission Manager to continue the sequence. This allowed the ground operations team to verify that the scenario was proceeding as planned before continuing to the next step. Later scenarios incorporated fewer ATPs. The final scenarios were compound autonomous sequences, performing rendezvous, capture, ORU transfer and fluid transfer without any ATPs.

==End of mission==
The final rendezvous and docking between the two spacecraft occurred on 29 June 2007. This was followed by the final demonstration, the changeout of a flight computer aboard ASTRO. NASA's plans for an extended mission were abandoned. The two craft demated for a final time, with ASTRO backing out to greater than {{convert|400|km|mi|abbr=on}}&lt;ref name="SFN-finished"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spaceflightnow.com/news/n0707/23oe/|title=Spaceflight Now - Breaking News - Satellite in-space servicing demo mission a success|work=spaceflightnow.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; in a test of sensor performance. Following this the craft performed a rendezvous to a standoff, where decommissioning took place.&lt;ref name="AviationWeek"&gt;[http://www.aviationweek.com/aw/generic/story_channel.jsp?channel=space&amp;id=news/express071807.xml Orbital Express Begins End-Of-Life Maneuver], [[Aviation Week]], July 18, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; The NEXTSat spacecraft was deactivated on 21 July, when its computers were turned off, and solar panels pointed away from the Sun. Subsequently, ASTRO vented its Hydrazine propellant, and was deactivated on 22 July 2007. The satellites were left to decay naturally.&lt;ref name=sfn20070704&gt;

NextSat was expected to take three to five years to decay, while the heavier ASTRO satellite was expected to take fifteen years.&lt;ref name=sfn20070704/&gt;
However, ASTRO reentered the atmosphere on 25 October 2013.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}

'''POEM@Home''' was a [[distributed computing]] project hosted by the [[Karlsruhe Institute of Technology]] and running on the [[Berkeley Open Infrastructure for Network Computing|Berkeley Open Infrastructure for Network Computing (BOINC)]] software platform. It modeled [[protein folding]] using [[Anfinsen's dogma]]. POEM@Home was started in 2007 and, due to advances using GPUs that rendered the BOINC program redundant, concluded in October 2016.&lt;ref&gt;[http://boinc.fzk.de/poem/old_news.php News archive] boinc.fzk.de{{Dead link|date=May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://boinc.fzk.de/poem/forum_thread.php?id=1280 End of project announcement] boinc.fzk.de{{Dead link|date=May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The POEM@home applications were proprietary.

==Scientific objectives==
The project studied how [[protein structure]] determined protein function, [[Protein structure prediction|predict a protein's structure]] from its [[amino acid]] sequence, investigated how [[Protein-protein interaction|proteins interact]] with each other, and understand how malfunctioning proteins can cause [[functional disorder]]s.  The resulting knowledge could then be used in the development of medical treatments.

The '''Planetary Fourier Spectrometer''' ('''PFS''') is an [[infrared]] [[spectrometer]] built by the [[Istituto Nazionale di Astrofisica]] (Italian National Institute for Astrophysics) along with the  [[Istituto di Fisica dello spazio Interplanetario]] and the [[Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche]] (Italian National Research Council). The instrument is currently used by the [[European Space Agency]] on both the [[Mars Express]] Mission and the [[Venus Express]] Mission. It consists of four units which together weigh around 31.4 kg, including a pointing device, a power supply, a control unit, and an interferometer with electronics. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://sci.esa.int/science-e/www/object/index.cfm?fobjectid=31033&amp;fbodylongid=659| title=PFS: Planetary Fourier Spectrometer | accessdate=August 31, 2006 | work=[http://www.esa.int/esaCP/index.html ESA] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The main objective of the instrument is to provide temperature profiles of Mars's carbon dioxide atmosphere, and to the study composition of the planet's atmosphere through the infrared radiation that is reflected and emitted by the planet.

==Methane in the Martian atmosphere==
On March 2004, Professor [[Vittorio Formisano]], the researcher in charge of the Mars Express Planetary Fourier Spectrometer, announced the discovery of [[methane]] in the Martian atmosphere. However, methane cannot persist in the Martian atmosphere for more than a few hundred years since it can be broken down by sunlight. Thus, this discovery suggests that the methane is being continually replenished by some unidentified [[Volcano|volcanic]] or geologic process, or that some kind of [[extremophile]] life form similar to some existing on Earth is [[Metabolism|metabolising]] [[carbon dioxide]] and [[hydrogen]] and producing methane. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/4295475.stm | title=Martian gases poses life question | accessdate=August 31, 2006 | work=[http://www.bbc.co.uk/ BBC News] | date=February 25, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;In July 2004, rumours began to circulate that Formisano would announce the discovery of [[ammonia]] at an upcoming conference. It later came to light that none had been found; in fact some noted that the PFS was not precise enough to distinguish ammonia from [[carbon dioxide]] anyway.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.nature.com/news/2004/040726/full/040726-3.html | title=The search for life on Mars | accessdate=March 19, 2006 | work=[http://www.nature.com Nature.com]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{short description| An ecological theory concerning the selection of life history traits }}
[[File:Eubalaena glacialis with calf.jpg|thumb|300px|A [[North Atlantic right whale]] with solitary calf. [[Whale reproduction]] follows a ''K''-selection strategy, with few offspring, long gestation, long parental care, and a long period until sexual maturity.]]
In [[ecology]], '''''r''/''K'' selection theory''' relates to the [[natural selection|selection]] of combinations of [[Trait (biological)|traits]] in an organism that trade off between quantity and quality of offspring. The focus upon either increased quantity of offspring at the expense of individual [[parental investment]] of r-strategists, or reduced quantity of offspring with a corresponding increased parental investment of K-strategists, varies widely, seemingly to promote success in particular environments.

The terminology of ''r''/''K''-selection was coined by the ecologists [[Robert MacArthur]] and [[E. O. Wilson]] in 1970&lt;ref name="Pianka, E.R 1970"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Pianka | first1 = E.R. | authorlink = Eric Pianka | year = 1970 | title = On r and K selection | journal = American Naturalist | volume = 104 | issue = 940| pages = 592–597 | url=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Eric_Pianka/publication/275142242_R-Selection_and_K-Selection/links/5487214f0cf2ef34478ec22e.pdf | doi = 10.1086/282697 }}&lt;/ref&gt; based on their work on [[island biogeography]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |authorlink1=Robert MacArthur |last1=MacArthur |first1=R. |authorlink2=E. O. Wilson |last2=Wilson |first2=E.O. |title=[[The Theory of Island Biogeography]] |publisher=Princeton University Press |year=1967 |isbn=0-691-08836-5 |edition=2001 reprint}}&lt;/ref&gt; although the concept of the evolution of life history strategies has a longer history &lt;ref&gt;For example: {{cite journal | first1= R. |last1=Margalef |authorlink=Ramon Margalef |title=Mode of evolution of species in relation to their places in ecological succession |year=1959 |journal=XVth International Congress of Zoology}}&lt;/ref&gt; (see e.g. [[plant strategies]]).

The theory was popular in the 1970s and 1980s, when it was used as a [[heuristic]] device, but lost importance in the early 1990s, when it was criticized by several empirical studies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Derek A. |last=Roff |title=Evolution Of Life Histories: Theory and Analysis |url={{Google books |plainurl=yes |id=_pv37gw8CIoC }} |year=1993 |publisher=Springer |isbn=978-0-412-02391-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="stearns1992"&gt;{{cite book |first=Stephen C. |last=Stearns |title=The Evolution of Life Histories |year=1992 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-857741-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[Life history theory|life-history]] paradigm has replaced the ''r''/''K'' selection paradigm but continues to incorporate many of its important themes.&lt;ref name=ReznickEA2002/&gt;

==Overview==
[[File:Mouse litter.jpg|thumb|A litter of rats with their mother. The reproduction of rats follows an ''r''-selection strategy, with many offspring, short gestation, less parental care, and a short time until sexual maturity.]]

In ''r''/''K'' selection theory, selective pressures are [[hypothesis]]ed to drive [[evolution]] in one of two generalized directions: ''r''- or ''K''-selection.&lt;ref name="Pianka, E.R 1970"/&gt; These terms, ''r'' and ''K'', are drawn from standard ecological [[algebra]] as illustrated in the simplified [[Logistic function#In ecology: modeling population growth|Verhulst model]] of [[population dynamics]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Verhulst | first1 = P.F. | authorlink = Pierre François Verhulst | year = 1838 | title = Notice sur la loi que la population pursuit dans son accroissement | journal = Corresp. Math. Phys. | volume = 10 | pages = 113–121 |url={{Google books |plainurl=yes |id=eRNbAAAAYAAJ |page=113 }} }}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{dN}{dt} = rN \left(1 - \frac{N}{K}\right) &lt;/math&gt;

where ''N'' is the [[population]], ''r'' is the maximum [[population growth rate|growth rate]], ''K'' is the [[carrying capacity]] of the local environment, and ''dN/dt'', the [[derivative]] of ''N'' with respect to time ''t'', is the rate of change in population with time. Thus, the equation relates the growth rate of the population ''N'' to the current population size, incorporating the effect of the two constant parameters ''r'' and ''K''.
(Note that decrease is negative growth.) The choice of the letter ''K'' came from the [[German language|German]] ''Kapazitätsgrenze'' (capacity limit), while ''r'' came from ''rate''.

===''r''-selection===
''r''-selected species are those that emphasize high growth rates, typically exploit less-crowded [[ecological niche]]s, and produce many [[offspring]], each of which has a relatively low probability of surviving to adulthood (i.e., high ''r'', low ''K'').&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;For example: {{cite journal | last=Weinbauer | first=M.G. |author2=Höfle, M.G. | date=1 October 1998| title=Distribution and Life Strategies of Two Bacterial Populations in a Eutrophic Lake | journal=Appl. Environ. Microbiol. | volume=64 | pages=3776–3783 | pmid=9758799 | issue=10 | pmc=106546 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  A typical ''r'' species is the dandelion (genus ''[[Taraxacum]]'').

In unstable or unpredictable environments, ''r''-selection predominates due to the ability to [[reproduction|reproduce]] quickly. There is little advantage in adaptations that permit successful competition with other organisms, because the environment is likely to change again. Among the traits that are thought to characterize ''r''-selection are high [[fecundity]], small [[allometry|body size]], early maturity onset, short generation time, and the ability to [[Biological dispersal|disperse]] offspring widely.

Organisms whose life history is subject to ''r''-selection are often referred to as ''r''-strategists or ''r''-selected. Organisms that exhibit ''r''-selected traits can range from [[bacteria]] and [[diatom]]s, to [[insect]]s and [[grass]]es, to various [[semelparous]] [[cephalopod]]s and small [[mammal]]s, particularly [[rodent]]s.

===''K''-selection===
By contrast, ''K''-selected species display traits associated with living at densities close to carrying capacity and typically are strong competitors in such crowded niches that [[parental investment|invest]] more heavily in fewer offspring, each of which has a relatively high probability of surviving to adulthood (i.e., low ''r'', high ''K''). In [[scientific literature]], ''r''-selected species are occasionally referred to as "opportunistic" whereas ''K''-selected species are described as "equilibrium".&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

In stable or predictable environments, ''K''-selection predominates as the ability to [[Competition (biology)|compete]] successfully for limited resources is crucial and populations of ''K''-selected organisms typically are very constant in number and close to the maximum that the environment can bear (unlike ''r''-selected populations, where population sizes can change much more rapidly).

Traits that are thought to be characteristic of ''K''-selection include large body size, long [[life expectancy]], and the production of fewer offspring, which often require [[Altriciality|extensive parental care]] until they mature. Organisms whose life history is subject to ''K''-selection are often referred to as ''K''-strategists or ''K''-selected.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bio.miami.edu/tom/courses/bil160/bil160goods/16_rKselection.html "r and K selection"]. University of Miami Department of Biology. Retrieved February 4, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Organisms with ''K''-selected traits include large organisms such as [[elephant]]s, [[human]]s, and [[whale]]s, but also smaller, long-lived organisms such as [[Arctic tern]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=John H. Duffus|author2=Douglas M. Templeton|author3=Monica Nordberg|title=Concepts in Toxicology|url={{Google books |plainurl=yes |id=MK2WC70Iu3MC |page=171 }} |year=2009|publisher=Royal Society of Chemistry|isbn=978-0-85404-157-2 |page=171 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[parrot]]s and [[eagle]]s.

===Continuous spectrum===
Although some organisms are identified as primarily ''r''- or ''K''-strategists, the majority of organisms do not follow this pattern.  For instance, trees have traits such as longevity and strong competitiveness that characterise them as ''K''-strategists.  In reproduction, however, trees typically produce thousands of offspring and disperse them widely, traits characteristic of ''r''-strategists.&lt;ref name="Hrdy, Sarah Blaffer 2000"&gt;Hrdy, Sarah Blaffer (2000), "Mother Nature: Maternal Instincts and How They Shape the Human Species" (Ballantine Books)&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly, [[reptile]]s such as [[sea turtle]]s display both ''r''- and ''K''-traits: although sea turtles are large organisms with long lifespans (provided they reach adulthood), they produce large numbers of unnurtured offspring.

The ''r''/''K'' dichotomy can be re-expressed as a continuous spectrum using the economic concept of [[discounted future returns]], with ''r''-selection corresponding to large discount rates and ''K''-selection corresponding to small discount rates.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.3934/mbe.2009.6.377| title = The discounted reproductive number for epidemiology| journal = Mathematical Biosciences and Engineering| volume = 6| issue = 2| pages = 377–393| year = 2009| last1 = Reluga | first1 = T. | last2 = Medlock | first2 = J. | last3 = Galvani | first3 = A. | pmc = 3685506}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ecological succession==
In areas of major ecological disruption or sterilisation (such as after a major [[volcanism|volcanic]] eruption, as at [[Krakatoa]] or [[Mount Saint Helens]]), ''r''- and ''K''-strategists play distinct roles in the [[ecological succession]] that regenerates the [[ecosystem]].  Because of their higher reproductive rates and ecological opportunism, primary colonisers typically are ''r''-strategists and they are followed by a succession of increasingly competitive [[flora]] and [[fauna]].  The ability of an environment to increase energetic content, through photosynthetic capture of solar energy, increases with the increase in complex [[biodiversity]] as ''r'' species proliferate to reach a peak possible with ''K'' strategies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=Lance H. |last1=Gunderson |first2=C.S. |last2=Holling |title=Panarchy: Understanding Transformations In Human And Natural Systems |url={{Google books |plainurl=yes |id=DHcjtSM5TogC }} |year=2001 |publisher=Island Press |isbn=978-1-55963-857-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Eventually a new equilibrium is approached (sometimes referred to as a [[climax community]]), with ''r''-strategists gradually being replaced by ''K''-strategists which are more competitive and better adapted to the emerging micro-environmental characteristics of the [[landscape]].  Traditionally, biodiversity was considered maximized at this stage, with introductions of new species resulting in the replacement and [[local extinction]] of [[Endemism|endemic]] species.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = McNeely | first1 = J. A. | year = 1994 | title = Lessons of the past: Forests and Biodiversity | url = http://www.springerlink.com/content/t76125571tr97m64/ | journal = Biodiversity and Conservation | volume = 3 | pages = 3–20 | doi = 10.1007/BF00115329 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the [[Intermediate Disturbance Hypothesis]] posits that intermediate levels of disturbance in a landscape create patches at different levels of succession, promoting coexistence of colonizers and competitors at the regional scale.

==Application==
While usually applied at the level of species, ''r''/''K'' selection theory is also useful in studying the evolution of ecological and [[Life history theory|life history]] differences between subspecies, for instance the African honey bee, [[African bee|''A. m. scutellata'']], and the Italian bee, [[Italian bee|''A. m. ligustica'']].&lt;ref name="Fewell and Bertram, 2002"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Fewell|first=Jennifer H.|author2=Susan M.

In 1981, a review of the ''r''/''K'' selection literature by Parry demonstrated that there was no agreement among researchers using the theory about the definition of ''r''- and ''K''-selection, which led him to question whether the assumption of a relation between reproductive expenditure and packaging of offspring was justified.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Parry |first=G.D. |title=The Meanings of r- and K-selection |journal=Oecologia |volume=48 |issue=2 |pages=260–4 |year=March 1981 |doi=10.1007/BF00347974 |url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00347974}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 1982 study by Templeton and Johnson, showed that in a population of ''[[Drosophila mercatorum]]'' under ''K''-selection the population actually produced a higher frequency of traits typically associated with ''r''-selection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Templeton A.R. |first2=J.S. |last2=Johnson |chapter=Life History Evolution Under Pleiotropy and K-selection in a Natural Population of Drosophila mercatorum |pages=225–239 |editor1-first=J.S.F. |editor1-last=Barker |editor2-first=W.T. |editor2-last=Starmer |title=Ecological genetics and evolution: the cactus-yeast-drosophila model system |url={{Google books |plainurl=yes |id=soDwAAAAMAAJ }} |year=1982 |publisher=Academic Press |isbn=978-0-12-078820-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several other studies contradicting the predictions of ''r''/''K'' selection theory were also published between 1977 and 1994.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Terry W. |last1=Snell |first2=Charles E. |last2=King |title=Lifespan and Fecundity Patterns in Rotifers: The Cost of Reproduction |journal=Evolution |volume=31 |issue=4 |pages=882–890 |date=December 1977 |doi=10.2307/2407451}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Charles E. |last1=Taylor |first2=Cindra |last2=Condra |title=r- and K-Selection in Drosophila pseudoobscura |journal=Evolution |volume=34 |issue=6 |pages=1183–93 |date=November 1980 |doi=10.2307/2408299}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Hollocher |first1=H. |last2=Templeton |first2=A.R. |title=The molecular through ecological genetics of abnormal abdomen in Drosophila mercatorum.

When Stearns reviewed the status of the theory in 1992,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=The Evolution of Life Histories | last=Stearns | first=S.C. | year=1992 | publisher=Oxford University Press | isbn=978-0-19-857741-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; he noted that from 1977 to 1982 there was an average of 42 references to the theory per year in the BIOSIS literature search service, but from 1984 to 1989 the average dropped to 16 per year and continued to decline. He concluded that ''r''/''K'' theory was a once useful heuristic that no longer serves a purpose in life history theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Graves | first=J.

More recently, the [[Panarchy#Systems theory|panarchy]] theories of [[adaptive capacity]] and [[Resilience (ecology)|resilience]] promoted by [[C. S. Holling]] and Lance Gunderson have revived interest in the theory, and use it as a way of integrating social systems, economics and ecology.&lt;ref&gt;Gunderson, L. H. and Holling C. S.

Writing in 2002, Reznick and colleagues reviewed the controversy regarding ''r''/''K'' selection theory and concluded that: 
{{quote|The distinguishing feature of the ''r''- and ''K''-selection paradigm was the focus on density-dependent selection as the important agent of selection on organisms’ life histories. This paradigm was challenged as it became clear that other factors, such as age-specific mortality, could provide a more mechanistic causative link between an environment and an optimal life history (Wilbur et al. 1974;&lt;ref name=wilbur74/&gt; Stearns 1976,&lt;ref name="stearns1976"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Stearns |first=S.C. |date=1976 |title=Life history tactics: a review of the ideas |url= |journal=Quarterly Review of Biology |publisher= |volume=51 |issue= |pages=3–47 |doi= 10.1086/409052}}&lt;/ref&gt; 1977&lt;ref name="stearns1977"/&gt;). The ''r''- and ''K''-selection paradigm was replaced by new paradigm that focused on age-specific mortality (Stearns, 1976;&lt;ref name="stearns1976"/&gt; Charlesworth, 1980&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Charlesworth |first=B. |date=1980 |title=Evolution in age structured populations |url= |location=Cambridge, UK |publisher=Cambridge University Press |page= |isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt;).

As described by the third of [[Newton's laws of motion]] of [[classical mechanics]], all forces occur in pairs such that if one object exerts a [[force]] on another object, then the second object exerts an equal and opposite reaction force on the first.&lt;ref name=Taylor&gt;{{cite book| last= Taylor| first= John R.| title= Classical Mechanics| year= 2005| url= https://books.google.com/books?id=P1kCtNr-pJsC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false| publisher= University Science Books| pages= 17–18| isbn= 9781891389221}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Shapiro|first1=Ilya L.|last2=de Berredo-Peixoto|first2=Guilherme|title=Lecture Notes on Newtonian Mechanics: Lessons from Modern Concepts|date=2013|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=1461478251|page=116|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EOS5BAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA116&amp;dq=all+forces+come+in+pairs&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjtypex77DPAhUB04MKHR8DBJEQ6AEILzAD#v=onepage&amp;q=all%20forces%20come%20in%20pairs&amp;f=false|accessdate=28 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The third law is also more generally stated as:  "To every action there is always opposed an equal reaction: or the mutual actions of two bodies upon each other are always equal, and directed to contrary parts."&lt;ref name=Scolium1&gt;This translation of the third law and the commentary following it can be found in the "[[Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy|Principia]]" on [https://books.google.com/books?id=Tm0FAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA20#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false page 20 of volume 1 of the 1729 translation].&lt;/ref&gt; The attribution of which of the two forces is the action and which is the '''reaction''' is arbitrary. Either of the two can be considered the action, while the other is its associated reaction.

==Examples==

===Interaction with ground===
When something is exerting force on the ground, the ground will push back with equal force in the opposite direction. In certain fields of applied physics, such as [[biomechanics]], this force by the ground is called '[[ground reaction force]]'; the force by the object on the ground is viewed as the 'action'.

When someone wants to jump, he or she exerts additional downward force on the ground ('action'). Simultaneously, the ground exerts upward force on the person ('reaction'). If this upward force is greater than the person's weight, this will result in upward acceleration. When these forces are perpendicular to the ground, they are also called a [[normal force]].

Likewise, the spinning wheels of a vehicle attempt to slide backward across the ground. If the ground is not too slippery, this results in a pair of [[friction]] forces: the 'action' by the wheel on the ground in backward direction, and the 'reaction' by the ground on the wheel in forward direction. This forward force propels the vehicle.

===Gravitational forces===
[[File:orbit4.gif|thumb|right|Two bodies similar to the [[Sun]] and [[Earth]], i.e. with an extreme difference in mass – the red X marks the barycenter ]]
The [[Earth]], among other [[planet]]s, orbits the [[Sun]] because the Sun exerts a gravitational pull that acts as a [[centripetal force]], holding the Earth to it, which would otherwise go shooting off into space. If the Sun's pull is considered an action, then Earth simultaneously exerts a reaction as a gravitational pull on the Sun. Earth's pull has the same amplitude as the Sun but in the opposite direction. Since the Sun's [[mass]] is so much larger than Earth's, the Sun does not generally appear to react to the pull of Earth, but in fact it does, as demonstrated in the animation (not to precise scale). A correct way of describing the combined motion of both objects (ignoring all other celestial bodies for the moment) is to say that they both orbit around the [[center of mass]], referred to in astronomy as the [[barycenter]], of the combined system.

===Supported mass===
Any mass on earth is pulled down by the [[gravitational force]] of the earth; this force is also called its [[weight]]. The corresponding 'reaction' is the gravitational force that mass exerts on the planet.

If the object is supported so that it remains at rest, for instance by a cable from which it is hanging, or by a surface underneath, or by a liquid on which it is floating, there is also a support force in upward direction ([[Tension (physics)|tension]] force, [[normal force]], [[buoyant]] force, respectively). This support force is an 'equal and opposite' force; we know this not because of Newton's Third Law, but because the object remains at rest, so that the forces must be balanced.

To this support force there is also a 'reaction': the object pulls down on the supporting cable, or pushes down on the supporting surface or liquid. In this case, there are therefore four forces of equal magnitude:

* F&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;. gravitational force by earth on object (downward)
* F&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. gravitational force by object on earth (upward)
* F&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;. force by support on object (upward)
* F&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;. force by object on support (downward)

Forces F&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and F&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; are equal due of Newton's Third Law; the same is true for forces F&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and F&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;.
Forces F&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and F&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; are equal if and only if the object is in equilibrium, and no other forces are applied. (This has nothing to do with Newton's Third Law.)

===Mass on a spring===
If a mass is hanging from a spring, the same considerations apply as before. However, if this system is then perturbed (e.g., the mass is given a slight kick upwards or downwards, say), the mass starts to oscillate up and down. Because of these accelerations (and subsequent decelerations), we conclude from Newton's second law that a net force is responsible for the observed change in velocity. The gravitational force pulling down on the mass is no longer equal to the upward elastic force of the spring. In the terminology of the previous section, F&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and F&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; are no longer equal.

However, it is still true that F&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = F&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and F&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; = F&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, as this is required by Newton's Third Law.

===Causal misinterpretation===
{{unreferenced section|date=September 2016}}
The terms 'action' and 'reaction' have the misleading suggestion of [[causality]], as if the 'action' is the cause and 'reaction' is the effect. It is therefore easy to think of the second force as being there because of the first, and even happening some time after the first. This is incorrect; the forces are perfectly simultaneous, and are there for the same reason.

When the forces are caused by a person's volition (e.g. a soccer player kicks a ball), this volitional cause often leads to an asymmetric interpretation, where the force by the player on the ball is considered the 'action' and the force by the ball on the player, the 'reaction'. But physically, the situation is symmetric. The forces on ball and player are both explained by their nearness, which results in a pair of contact forces (ultimately due to electric repulsion). That this nearness is caused by a decision of the player has no bearing on the physical analysis. As far as the physics is concerned, the labels 'action' and 'reaction' can be flipped.

==='Equal and opposite'===
One problem frequently observed by physics educators is that students tend to apply Newton's Third Law to pairs of 'equal and opposite' forces acting on the same object.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

| quote = ... following question in writing: Newton’s third law speaks about ‘action’ and ‘reaction’. Imagine a bottle of wine standing on a table. If the gravitational force that attracts the bottle is called the action, what force is the reaction to this force according to Newton’s third law? The answer most frequently given was: ‘The normal force the table exerts on the bottle’.

This is incorrect; the Third Law refers to forces on two different objects. For example, a book lying on a table is subject to a downward gravitational force (exerted by the earth) and to an upward normal force by the table. Since the book is not accelerating, these forces must be exactly balanced, according to Newton's First or Second law. They are therefore 'equal and opposite'. However, these forces are not always equally strong; they will be different if the book is pushed down by a third force, or if the table is slanted, or if the table-and-book system is in an accelerating elevator. The case of [http://www.iei.info/knol/pf/3trm10yysobsi-2-newton-s-laws-the-concepts.php three or more  forces]
is covered by considering the sum of all forces.

A possible cause of this problem is that the Third Law is often stated in an abbreviated form: ''For every action there is an equal and opposite reaction,'' without the details, namely that these forces act on two different objects. Moreover, there is a causal connection between the weight of something and the normal force: if an object had no weight, it would not experience support force from the table, and the weight dictates how strong the support force will be. This causal relationship is not due to the Third Law but to other physical relations in the system.

===Centripetal and centrifugal force===
Another common mistake{{Or|date=November 2010}} is to state that

''The centrifugal force that an object experiences is the reaction to the centripetal force on that object.''

If an object were simultaneously subject to both a [[centripetal force]] and an equal and opposite [[centrifugal force]], the [[Net force|resultant force]] would vanish and the object could not experience a circular motion. The centrifugal force is sometimes called a [[fictitious force]] or pseudo force, to underscore the fact that such a force only appears when calculations or measurements are conducted in non-inertial reference frames.

'''Robin A Williams''' (born 13 November 1952 in [[London]]) is a Professor of Social Research on Technology at the [[University of Edinburgh]], Scotland, and director of the [[Institute for the Study of Science, Technology and Innovation]]. He is an interdisciplinary researcher in the field of Science and Technology Studies and contributed much to the [[social shaping of technology]] by studying the interplay between 'social' and 'technical' factors in the design and implementation of a range of technologies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Staff Profiles|url=http://www.stis.ed.ac.uk/staff_profiles/williams_robin|publisher=University of Edinburgh|accessdate=5 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biography ==
After studying Natural Sciences and Social and Political Science at the University of Cambridge, Robin Williams took an MSc and PhD at [[Aston University]] and worked as research fellow in the Technology Policy Unit until 1986. He then joined the Research Centre for Social Sciences (RCSS) at the University of Edinburgh and coordinated the Edinburgh PICT Centre, one of the six university research centres established under the ESRC Programme on Information and Communications Technologies (1986 - 1995).&lt;ref&gt;Melody, William H (1987). "Innovative research in support of more informed decision making", ''Aslib Proceedings'', 39(6)&lt;/ref&gt; During this time Robin Williams and other researchers in Edinburgh PICT Centre published on issues regarding social, economic and political aspects of the design and implementation of technology.&lt;ref&gt;PICT Report (1994). "Edinburgh PICT Centre 1987-1994 End of Award Report", ''University of Edinburgh''&lt;/ref&gt; Concluding the findings of a decade's research Robin Williams and David Edge published a notable paper on the ‘broad church’ of [[social shaping of technology]].&lt;ref&gt;Williams, Robin, and David Edge (1996). "The social shaping of technology", ''Research policy'', 25(6)&lt;/ref&gt; He became director of RCSS in 1997.

In 2000 Robin Williams established the [[Institute for the Study of Science, Technology and Innovation]] (ISSTI) to bring together groups of academics and individual researchers across the [[University of Edinburgh]] who are involved in research, teaching and knowledge transfer on social and policy aspects of science, technology and innovation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ISSTI - About the Institute|url=http://www.issti.ed.ac.uk/about|publisher=University of Edinburgh|accessdate=5 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was co-director of ESRC Innogen Centre from 2002-2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Innogen|url=http://www.genomicsnetwork.ac.uk/innogen/people/academicstaff/forename,2414,en.html|publisher=Genomicsnetwork|accessdate=5 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008 he arranged the merger of RCSS and the Science Studies Unit to form the Science, Technology and Innovation Studies subject group in the [[University of Edinburgh School of Social and Political Science]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Williams,Robin (2016).

'''Sandberg''' is the name of a post office and small surrounding community that was attached to '''The Sandberg Lodge''' (originally Sandberg's Summit Hotel), located on the [[Ridge Route]] highway in the [[Sierra Pelona Mountains]] of [[Southern California]]. The Ridge Route linked the [[Greater Los Angeles Area|Greater Los Angeles]] area to the [[San Joaquin Valley]] and [[Central California]] from 1919 through 1933.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rrchs.org/sandberg.html Ridge Route Communities Historical Society and Museum: The Sandberg Lodge]&lt;/ref&gt;

The lodge was destroyed by a fire in 1961,&lt;ref name=Times1961&gt;"Landmark Lodge Burns Near Gorman," ''Los Angeles Times,'' April 30, 1961, page 1.&lt;/ref&gt; but the site lives on as a dot on northwestern [[Los Angeles County]] maps.&lt;ref name=Gerrard&gt;Marika Gerrard,  "Sandberg Residents Learn to Live With Isolation ‘’Los Angeles Times,’’ May 6, 1981. Two cabins survived the fire with one having been moved to a nearby ranch. &lt;/ref&gt; Sandberg was later the site of a U.S. [[weather station]].

==History==

===The Sandbergs===
[[Image:Sandberg-Inn.jpg|thumb|400px|The Sandberg Lodge in the 1920s, from an image on the historic marker at the site.]]
:{{cquote|Sandberg's was the high-class place. This is where you would see the Cadillacs, Packards and Studebakers parked. It was said they had a sign, 'Truck Drivers and Dogs Not Allowed'. &lt;ref name=Scott/&gt;}}

Harald Sandberg, a native of Norway, settled in the Antelope Valley with his brother, Albert, in 1882, and they developed large areas there.&lt;ref name=Obit&gt;"Harald Sandberg," ''Los Angeles Times,'' July 11, 1939, page A-20.&lt;/ref&gt; On April 2, 1897, Harald filed homestead papers on ranch property just north of the parcel that later housed his hotel and inn.&lt;ref name=Scott&gt;Harrison Irving Scott, ''The Road That United California,'' privately printed, Torrance, California, 2002. {{ISBN|0-615-12000-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 1900 the brothers made news when they " ''captured a very large specimen of the [[California condor]] on their mountain ranch at [[Neenach, California|Neenach]], near [[Newhall, California|Newhall]], last Saturday''."

:&lt;blockquote&gt;" ''The bird had gorged itself on a dead cow until unable to fly, and will now have to pay for being a blutton ''[sic]'' by a term of captivity. . . . The specimen captured measures about twelve feet from tip to tip of wing. . . . Few specimens of this condor have ever been captured, and this is regarded as a prize. If brought to the city it will probably be put in the park menagerie''."&lt;ref&gt;"California Condor Captured," ''Los Angeles Times,'' December 20, 1900, page I-10.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Harald built his lodge in 1914,&lt;ref name=Obit/&gt; just one year before the opening of the Ridge Route resulted in a parade of cars by his front door, seven days a week. "Sandberg's lodge at the top of the grade was a welcome sight to weary [Los Angeles] motorists still only halfway to [[Bakersfield, California|Bakersfield]]," the ''Los Angeles Times'' reported.&lt;ref name=Gerrard/&gt; A hotel, restaurant, and cabins were constructed on leased [[United States Forest Service|Forest Service]] land immediately to the south of the homesteaded property.&lt;ref name=Scott/&gt;

When first opened in a one-story building, the business was named Sandberg's Summit Hotel. Some time after 1921 the owner turned it into a three-story log hostelry set amid a grove of California [[live oak]]s. A crank telephone provided access to the outside world via the long-distance phone circuits that connected Los Angeles with Bakersfield. Cabins also provided lodging behind the hotel.&lt;ref name=Scott/&gt;

In 1918, Harald Sandberg was appointed postmaster of the settlement, which was thenceforth named '''Sandberg,''' with the post office inside the hotel itself.&lt;ref name=Scott/&gt;

"It was a small tourist community," Bakersfield resident Frank Kaufman told Interviewer Harrison Irving Scott (author of a history of the Ridge Route); it had a repair garage that advertised "Labor $2, after 6 p.m. $3; never closed." Motor Stages would stop at Sandberg's for meals, and motorists would hunger for Mrs. (Marion) Sandberg's apple pie.&lt;ref name=Scott/&gt;

In September 1929, attorney and [[real estate developer]] Ulysses S. Grant Jr., the son of the 18th American president, checked into Sandberg's with his wife and nephew for a visit. He died of a heart attack in his room.&lt;ref&gt;"Son of Soldier and Statesman Expires," ''Los Angeles Times,'' September 27, page A-1.&lt;/ref&gt;

In spring 1934, the lodge was put up for sale. A newspaper classified advertisement described it:

&lt;blockquote&gt;" ''RESORT SANITARIUM DUDE RANCH SANDBERG'S INN. RIDGE ROUTE. 75 mi. from L.A. by highway. Ideal climate: natural beauty. 100 A. of tree covered level &amp; rolling land. Secluded &amp; quiet. 3-story bldg. with lobby, dining rm., hotel rms., etc. 7 other bldgs. Accommodate 35 guests. Own elec. &amp; water plants. Fully equipt. &amp; furn. to operate now. Sell or TRADE. Phone CRestview 7644 or Box M-285, Times''."&lt;ref&gt;''Los Angeles Times,'' April 1, 1934, page C-5.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Sandberg died on July 9, 1939, and his wife on April 1, 1954.

===Interregnum===
By the time of Harald Sandberg's death, there were new operators for the place, a newspaper advertisement having proclaimed:
&lt;blockquote&gt;" ''Grand Opening and Free Barbecue Sunday, May 28, 1939. Sandberg Lodge and [[Dude Ranch]], Larry Brock  proprietor, Harry Moss Manager''."&lt;ref name=Scott/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

But the hotel never regained its former popularity: An [[Ridge Route Alternate#Bypasses and the fate of the bypassed road|alternate to the Ridge Route]] was opened, an event that virtually stopped traffic through Sandberg. Nevertheless, J.H. Cox purchased both the lodge and the ranch and, according to Walter W. (Lucky) Stevens, a later owner, Cox tainted the hotel's  reputation by allegedly "bringing in booze, [[slot machine]]s and 'ladies of the night.' " Cox sold the operation to Lillian Grojean, who turned the hotel garage into a ceramics factory;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.google.com/search?client=safari&amp;rls=en&amp;q=%22lillian+grojean%22&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8 Lillian Grojean's pottery is still in demand by collectors.]&lt;/ref&gt; her lease from the Forest Service amounted to $90 a year.&lt;ref name=Scott/&gt;

===Lucky Stevens===
Lucky Stevens, a sometime film actor,&lt;ref&gt;His single film credit is listed [https://www.imdb.com/name/nm2351635/ here in the Internet Movie Data Base.]&lt;/ref&gt; was running a ceramics business in [[Burbank, California|Burbank]] when he met Grojean. In 1950 or 1951 he paid her $15,000 for the dilapidated hotel, outbuildings, and lease.&lt;ref name=Scott/&gt;

[[Image:Ridge Route Sandberg Inn damage.jpg|thumb|300px|All that was left of the Sandberg Inn in 2006]]
At first he had plans to install a swimming pool and a fishing pond and to reopen the property as a guest ranch. By that time, the lodge was in disrepair, with pigeons roosting among the [[rafter]]s.&lt;ref name=Times1952&gt;"Memories Haunt Old Ridge Route," ''Los Angeles Times,'' September 8, 1952, page 2.. The ''Times'' story apparently referred erroneously to Harald Sandberg as Hiram Sandberg.&lt;/ref&gt; Eight years later, he said he wanted to open the spread of {{convert|20|acre|m2|sigfig=2}} as a children's ranch,&lt;ref name=Hillinger&gt;Charles Hillinger, "Old Ridge Route Trip Turns Back Clock to 20s," ''Los Angeles Times,'' March 14, 1960&lt;/ref&gt; and he did succeed in acquiring money, furniture, and used clothing.&lt;ref name=Scott/&gt;

On April 29, 1961, fire destroyed the main lodge. Stevens was alone in the building. A district forest ranger said the blaze was apparently started by sparks from the chimney,&lt;ref name="Times1961"/&gt; and Stevens told an interviewer later that he had been burning trash when the flames began.&lt;ref name=Scott/&gt;

The Forest Service canceled Stevens' lease in 1963,&lt;ref name=Scott/&gt; and nothing remains on the site today but a [[historic marker]], some stone steps, a bit of [[Foundation (engineering)|foundation]], trees, and shrubbery.

==Weather observation and fire station==
{{cquote|It's just  shack on top of a mountain, but the data gathered there is of great importance to the Los Angeles weatherman in determining his forecast.&lt;ref name=Hulse&gt;"Wind Blows Weatherman Bald on Bald Mountain," ''Los Angeles Times,'' January 18, 1953, page B-1.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

A four-man weather station was established in 1933&lt;ref name=Gerrard/&gt; at the windy peak of nearby [[Bald Mountain (California)|Bald Mountain]], which straddles the boundary between the [[Oceanic climate|maritime climate]] to the south and a drier climate to the north. In 1953, the weather observers had to visually check the instruments and manually transmit the information via Teletype.&lt;ref name=Hulse/&gt;

In 1978, the Weather Service switched to an automated station, explaining, in the words of ''Los Angeles Times'' staff writer Marika Gerrard,  that "It was just too hard to find someone to live up in that remote region with nothing to do but record weather statistics every hour on  the hour." Nevertheless, in May 1981 reporter Gerrard found two people living at the station — a college student-caretaker and a man experimenting with the prototype of  a modular [[wind turbine]].

The other two people living in Sandberg in that month were Willard Sparks, captain of the Quail Lake Fire Station, and his wife, Shirley. Sparks was responsible for covering {{convert|300|sqmi|km2|sigfig=1}} of forested land that included Sandberg, Gorman, [[Pyramid Lake (Los Angeles County, California)|Pyramid Lake]], part of the Angeles Forest, and a stretch of Interstate 5 known as "Blood Alley" because of the frequent accidents there.&lt;ref name=Gerrard/&gt;

'''Star 48''' is a type of [[solid rocket]] motor used by many space propulsion and launch vehicle [[Staging (rocketry)|stages]].  It is used almost exclusively as an upper stage.  It was developed primarily by [[Thiokol|Thiokol Propulsion]], and is now manufactured by [[Orbital ATK]], which purchased Thiokol in 2001.&lt;ref name="ATK SRM Catalog"&gt;{{cite book |title= ATK Space Propulsion Products Catalog |publisher= ATK | year= 2012 |pages=99ff |url=http://www.atk.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/ATK-Motor-Catalog-2012.pdf |accessdate=2013-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; A Star 48B stage is also one of the few man-made items sent on escape trajectories out of the Solar System, although it is derelict since its use. The Star 48B variant is the PAM-D upper stage used on the Delta II rocket.

The Star 48 has been used as a third stage in a three stage launch systems.

==Overview==

The "48" designation refers to the approximate diameter of the fuel casing in inches; Thiokol had also manufactured other motors such as the [[Star 37]] and Star 30.  Internally, Thiokol's designation was TE-M-711 for early versions, and TE-M-799 for later ones.  Subtypes are given one or more letter suffixes after the diameter number, or a trailing number (i.e., "-2") after the internal designation. Not surprisingly, the "T" prefix stands for Thiokol, and the following letter refers to the company division that developed the rocket motor. In this case, "E" refers to the Elkton, MD division and the "M" stands for motor.

The most common use of the Star 48 was as the final stage of the [[Delta II]] launch vehicles.  Other launchers have also incorporated the motor, but with lower frequency.  In such usage, the complete stage (motor plus accessories) is referred to as the [[Payload Assist Module]] (PAM), as the Shuttle could only take satellites to [[low Earth orbit]].  Because [[geostationary]] orbit is much more lucrative, the additional stage was needed for the final leg of the journey.  On such missions, the stage is [[Spin-stabilized satellite|spin-stabilized]].  A turntable, mounted in the shuttle payload bay or atop the previous Delta stage, spun the PAM and payload to approximately 60 rpm prior to release.

Usually after motor burnout and just prior to satellite release the PAM is de-spun using a [[yo-yo de-spin]] technique.

A non-spinning, [[Thrust vectoring|thrust-vectoring]] version of the Star 48 is available ("Star 48BV"), but much less common. A thrust-vectoring Star 48 is the final stage of the [[Minotaur IV|Minotaur IV+]] launch vehicle.

A Star 48BV was used in conjunction with a  [[Delta IV Heavy]] for the [[Parker Solar Probe]] launch.&lt;ref name="Delta 4"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://spaceflightnow.com/2015/03/18/delta-4-heavy-selected-for-launch-of-solar-probe/|title=Delta 4-Heavy selected for launch of solar probe|last=Clark|first=Stephen|date=March 18, 2015|work=Spaceflight Now|accessdate=March 18, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://spaceflightnow.com/2018/04/27/ulas-heavy-lifter-rolled-out-for-solar-probe-launch/|title=ULA’s heavy-lifter rolled out for solar probe launch – Spaceflight Now|website=spaceflightnow.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A Star 48 motor used in the 3rd stage of the [[New Horizons]] probe was the first part of the New Horizons mission to reach [[Jupiter]], arriving before the probe.&lt;ref name='space_nh' /&gt; It also crossed [[Pluto]]'s orbit in 2015 at a distance of 200 million kilometers.

A Star 48 [[Payload Assist Module]] that had been used to launch a [[GPS satellite]] in 1993 crashed in the Saudi Arabian desert in January 2001, after its orbit decayed.  The unit did not burn up on reentry and was positively identified on the ground.&lt;ref name="orb_debris"&gt;{{cite journal|title=PAM-D Debris Falls in Saudi Arabia|journal=The Orbital Debris Quarterly News|date=April 2001|volume=6|issue=2|page=1|url=http://orbitaldebris.jsc.nasa.gov/newsletter/pdfs/ODQNv6i2.pdf|publisher=NASA [[Johnson Space Center]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013 a Star 48GXV was tested for the [[Solar Probe Plus]] mission.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/atk-and-nasa-successfully-demonstrate-new-rocket-motor-for-solar-probe-plus-mission-234652981.html|title=ATK and NASA Successfully Demonstrate New Rocket Motor for Solar Probe Plus Mission|website=Prnewswire.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Star 48B==
The Star 48B version has an extra 11 kilograms of propellant more than the regular Star 48, for  a total of 2011 kg.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.astronautix.com/s/star48b.html|title=Star 48B|website=Astronautix.com|access-date=2018-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is a version of the Star 48B that is lengthened and also heavier, called the Star 48B L.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.astronautix.com/s/star48bl.html|title=Star 48B l|website=Astronautix.com|access-date=2018-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In operation as a third stage, the Star 48B sits on top of spin table, and before it is separated it is spun up to stabilize it during the separation from the previous stage.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mjAJNZYQ9K8C&amp;pg=PA126&amp;dq=Star+48B&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjrsuykrZreAhUS2FMKHWvlD98Q6AEIPDAE#v=onepage&amp;q=Star%2048B&amp;f=false|title=Space Handbook: A War Fighter's Guide to Space, V. 1|last=Muolo|first=Michael J.|date=November 1993|publisher=Government Printing Office|isbn=9780160613555|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; (see also [[Spin-stabilisation]]) The Star 48B can produce 15,000 pounds of thrust (66.723 kilonewtons), with a burn time of 1 minute 27 seconds.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.thisdayinaviation.com/tag/pam-d-payload-assist-module/|title=PAM-D Payload Assist Module Archives - This Day in Aviation|website=This Day in Aviation|language=en-US|access-date=2018-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A Star 48B was used on the third stage of the  [[New Horizons]] spacecraft launch.&lt;reF&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nasa.gov/pdf/139889main_PressKit12_05.pdf|format=PDF|title=:Press kit : NASA’s First Mission to Pluto and the Kuiper Belt|website=Nasa.gov|accessdate=22 October 2018}}&lt;/reF&gt; New Horizons was launched by its stack in January 2006, and the Star 48B booster was launched along with the New Horizons's spacecraft on an escape trajectory out of the Solar System.&lt;ref name=JHUAPL&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://pluto.jhuapl.edu/News-Center/News-Article.php?page=20101028 |title=Where Is the New Horizons Centaur Stage? |first1=Alan|last1=Stern |first2=Yanping|last2=Guo |date=October 28, 2010 |work=Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory |access-date=2018-10-22|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Star 48B ignited and burned for 48-seconds, taking both on a trajectory past Pluto; however because the Star 48B became derelict and did not have course corrections like the NH spacecraft, it would be projected to miss Pluto by hundreds of millions of miles.&lt;ref name=JHUAPL /&gt;

''New Horizons'' Star 48B was calculated to arrive at planet [[Jupiter]] 6 hours before ''New Horizons'', and on Oct 15, 2015 would pass through Pluto's orbit at a distance of 213 million kilometers (over 1 AU) distant from [[Pluto]].&lt;ref name=JHUAPL /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unmannedspaceflight.com/index.php?s=&amp;showtopic=2079&amp;view=findpost&amp;p=37667|title=Star 48b Third-stage Motor - Unmanned Spaceflight.com|website=Unmannedspaceflight.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was nearly four months after the ''New Horizons'' probe did.&lt;ref name='space_nh'&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.space.com/1991-derelict-booster-beat-pluto-probe-jupiter.html|title=Derelict Booster to Beat Pluto Probe to Jupiter|website=Space.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Star 48B is basis for the [[McDonnell Douglas]] '''PAM-D''' upper stage used on the Delta rocket.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;
