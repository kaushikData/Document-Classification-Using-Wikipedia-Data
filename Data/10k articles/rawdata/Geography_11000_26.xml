The '''Adrar''' ([[Berber languages|Berber]] for "mountain"&lt;ref name = brill/&gt;) is a highland [[natural region|natural]] and [[historical region]] of the [[Sahara Desert]] in northern [[Mauritania]]. The [[Adrar Region]], an administrative division of Mauritania, is named after the traditional region. It is sometimes called Adrar Tamar to distinguish it from other areas called Adrar in the Sahara.&lt;ref name = brill&gt;{{cite web | url = http://referenceworks.brillonline.com/entries/encyclopaedia-of-islam-3/adrar-of-mauritania-SIM_0305 | title = Adrar of Mauritania | accessdate = 2016-11-20 | publisher = Brill Online Reference|work = Encyclopedia of Islam, THREE}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geography==
The Adrar is an arid [[plateau]], known for its [[Canyon|gorges]], regs (stony deserts) and [[sand dune]]s. Structurally the Adrar is a low central [[massif]] which rises to over {{convert|700|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} above sea level just east of [[Atar, Mauritania|Atar]] near the Ebnou Pass on the track to [[Chinguetti]], then loses elevation and becomes subsumed by dunes to the south and east. Limited cultivation is only possible in the gorges at lower elevations where the water table is high enough to support large palm groves.&lt;ref name = Britannica/&gt;

Notable features include the Oued el Abiod or 'White Valley', a dune-filled fault line along which many small settlements and palm groves are found. The Guelb [[Aouelloul crater]] is 3.1 million-old impact crater which was studied by the noted Saharan scholar, [[Théodore Monod]]. To the east beyond Ouadane is the distinctive [[Richat Structure]], an uplifted and then heavily eroded dome of strata approximately 40&amp;nbsp;km across and whose concentric rings resemble an impact crater when observed from space.

The Adrar region is home to a small human population, centered on the town of [[Atar, Mauritania|Atar]]. The ancient town of [[Ouadane]], formerly an important [[Caravan (travellers)|caravan]] and gold-trading centre, is located towards the eastern edge of the Adrar. [[Chinguetti]] is another important historical town in the region.&lt;ref name = Britannica&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.britannica.com/place/Adrar-plateau-Mauritania |title = Adrar plateau, Mauritania | accessdate = 2016-11-20 | publisher = [[Encyclopædia Britannica]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The Adrar was settled in the [[Neolithic]] era as shown by cave and rock paintings found in the area. The more recent [[arid]]ification has left much of the [[archaeology]] intact, most notable several [[stone circle]]s, e.g. Atar Stone Circle, and the later town of [[Azougui]].&lt;ref name = brill/&gt;

Beginning in the mid-17th century, migrants from the Adrar Plateau region moved into the [[Tagant Plateau]] and displaced the native population.&lt;ref&gt;James L. A. Webb , ''Desert Frontier: Ecological and Economic Change Along the Western Sahel'', p.50.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <model>wikitext</model>
      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9002">'''Automatic label placement''', sometimes called '''text placement''' or '''name placement''', comprises the computer methods of placing labels automatically on a map or chart. This is related to the [[Labeling (map design)|typographic design of such labels]].

The typical features depicted on a geographic [[map]] are line features (e.g. roads), area features (countries, parcels, forests, lakes, etc.), and point features (villages, cities, etc.). In addition to depicting the map's features in a geographically accurate manner, it is of critical importance to place the names that identify these features, in a way that the reader knows instantly which name describes which feature.

Automatic text placement is one of the most difficult, complex, and time-consuming problems in mapmaking and [[Geographic information system|GIS (Geographic Information System)]]. Other kinds of computer-generated graphics – like [[chart]]s, [[graph of a function|graph]]s etc. – require good placement of labels as well, not to mention engineering drawings, and professional programs which produce these drawings and charts, like [[spreadsheets]] (e.g. [[Microsoft Excel]]) or computational software programs (e.g. [[Mathematica]]).

Naively placed labels overlap excessively, resulting in a map that is difficult or even impossible to read. Therefore, a GIS must allow a few possible placements of each label, and often also an option of resizing, rotating, or even removing (suppressing) the label. Then, it selects a set of placements that results in the least overlap, and has other desirable properties. For all but the most trivial setups, the problem is [[NP-hard]].

==Rule-based algorithms==
Rule-based algorithms try to emulate an experienced human cartographer. Over centuries, cartographers have developed the art of mapmaking and label placement. For example, an experienced cartographer repeats road names several times for long roads, instead of placing them once, or in the case of Ocean City depicted by a point very close to the shore, the cartographer would place the label "Ocean City" over the land to emphasize that it is a coastal town.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Slocum|first=Terry|title=Thematic Cartography and Geovisualization|year=2010|publisher=Pearson|location=Upper Saddle River, NJ|isbn=0-13-801006-4|pages=576|url=https://www.amazon.de/dp/0138010064}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cartographers work based on accepted conventions and rules and they place labels in order of importance. For example, New York City, Vienna, Berlin, Paris, or Tokyo must show up on country maps because they are high-priority labels. Once those are placed, the cartographer places the next most important class of labels, for example major roads, rivers, and other large cities. In every step they ensure that (1) the text is placed in a way that the reader easily associates it with the feature, and (2) the label does not overlap with those already placed on the map.

==Local optimization algorithms==
The simplest [[greedy algorithm]] places consecutive labels on the map in positions that result in minimal overlap of labels. Its results are not perfect even for very simple problems, but it is extremely fast.

Slightly more complex algorithms rely on local optimization to reach a local optimum of a placement evaluation function – in each iteration placement of a single label is moved to another position, and if it improves the result, the move is preserved. It performs reasonably well for maps that are not too densely labelled. Slightly more complex variations try moving 2 or more labels at the same time. The algorithm ends after reaching some local optimum.

A simple algorithm – [[simulated annealing]] – yields good results with relatively good performance. It works like local optimization, but it may keep a change even if it worsens the result. The chance of keeping such a change is &lt;math&gt;\exp \frac{-\Delta E}{T}&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\Delta E&lt;/math&gt; is the change in the evaluation function, and &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; is the ''temperature''. The temperature is gradually lowered according to the ''annealing schedule''. When the temperature is high, simulated annealing performs almost random changes to the label placement, being able to escape a [[local optimum]]. Later, when hopefully a very good local optimum has been found, it behaves in a manner similar to local optimization. The main challenges in developing a simulated annealing solution are choosing a good evaluation function and a good annealing schedule. Generally too fast cooling will degrade the solution, and too slow cooling will degrade the performance, but the schedule is usually quite a complex algorithm, with more than just one parameter.

Another class of direct search algorithms are the various [[evolutionary algorithm]]s, e.g. [[genetic algorithm]]s.

==Divide-and-conquer algorithms==
One simple optimization that is important on real maps is dividing a set of labels into smaller sets that can be solved independently. Two labels are ''rivals'' if they can overlap in one of the possible placements. [[transitive relation|Transitive]] closure of this relation divides the set of labels into possibly much smaller sets. On uniformly and densely labelled maps, usually the single set will contain the majority of labels, and on maps for which the labelling is not uniform it may bring very big performance benefits. For example, when labelling a map of the world, [[United States|America]] is labelled independently from [[Eurasia]] etc.

==2-satisfiability algorithms==
If a map labeling problem can be reduced to a situation in which each remaining label has only two potential positions in which it can be placed, then it may be solved efficiently by using an instance of [[2-satisfiability]] to find a placement avoiding any conflicting pairs of placements; several exact and approximate label placement algorithms for more complex types of problems are based on this principle.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first1=Srinivas|last1=Doddi|first2=Madhav V.|last2=Marathe|first3=Andy|last3=Mirzaian|first4=Bernard M.

==Other algorithms==
Automatic label placement algorithms can use any of the algorithms for finding the [[maximum disjoint set]] from the set of potential labels. Other algorithms can also be used, like various graph solutions, [[integer programming]] etc.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12263">'''Billie Lee Turner II''' (born December 22, 1945, Texas City, Texas, USA) is an [[United States of America|American]] [[geographer]], member of the [[United States National Academy of Sciences|National Academy of Sciences]], and prominent among the third generation of the [[Berkeley School of Latin Americanist Geography]].  In August 2008, he took a position as the first Gilbert F. White Chair in Environment and Society at [[Arizona State University]], where he is affiliated with the School of Geographical Sciences and Urban Planning and the School of Sustainability. In November 2015, he was named a Regent’s Professor, the highest faculty honor that can be bestowed by [[Arizona State University]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://asunow.asu.edu/20151120-asu-news-three-asu-faculty-members-appointed-regents-professors ASU.edu], retrieved Nov 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Turner BL II.jpg|thumb|150px|right|Billie Lee Turner, II]] For most of his career (1980–2008) he taught at [[Clark University]] in [[Worcester, Massachusetts]].  There, he served as Alice C. Higgins and Milton P. Professor of Environment and Society, and Director of the Graduate School of Geography.

==Personal==
Raised and educated in [[Texas]], he is the first son of [[Billie Lee Turner (botanist)|Billie Lee Turner]], a noted synantheralologist ([[botany|botanist]] studying [[Asteraceae]]). He has a B.A. and M.A. in Geography from the University of Texas at Austin (1968, 1969) and received his [[Doctor of Philosophy|PhD]] at the [[University of Wisconsin–Madison]] in 1974 for work on Mayan agriculture.&lt;ref&gt;[https://geoplan.asu.edu/people/b-l-turner-ii ASU.edu] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151125025525/https://geoplan.asu.edu/people/b-l-turner-ii |date=November 25, 2015 }}, retrieved Nov 2015&lt;/ref&gt; He then taught at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County for two years, and was based from 1975-1979 in the Department of Geography, University of Oklahoma before moving to Clark University in 1980 and Arizona State University in 2008.

==Scholarship==
Turner's contributions to knowledge have evolved from an interest in human impacts on the natural world. His early study was on the borders of [[archaeology]] and geography - the pre-Hispanic [[agricultural]] systems of the [[Maya peoples|Maya]] in the [[Yucatán Peninsula]] of [[Mexico]] (Turner, 1983; Harrison &amp; Turner, 1978). This geographical and archaeological work fueled an interest in agricultural pathways and livelihoods more generally, particularly patterns of agricultural intensification. As an authority of agricultural systems, Turner produced several influential texts on the theory of agrarian change (Turner and Brush, 1989; Turner, 1974; Turner, Hyden &amp; Kates, 1993).

The environmental transformations that have accompanied population growth  in [[Central America]] led to a broader engagement with cultural ecology and the human relationship with nature. A major initiative with colleagues at Clark University, which was always a center for this type of work under [[Robert Kates]], Roger Kasperson and others, culminated in the ''Earth Transformed by Human Action'' (1990), a major stocktaking of anthropogenic impacts on the planet and its ecosystems. Over the last 20 years Turner has led, or participated in, other research on the science and dynamics of global environmental change (e.g. Steffen et al., 2004).

His interest in specific impacts of populations and societies on land use change and alterations in land cover led to a return to fieldwork in Central America in the 1990s, supported by several large research grants and working with a number of PhD students. The specific focus was to understand contemporary patterns of land use, informed by social investigations and GIS and remote sensing (Turner et al., 2004; Gutman et al., 2004). Turner is associated with the development of LUCC analysis - Land Use/Cover Change and ways to assess it, as concern grows about tropical deforestation and [[agricultural expansion]]. He has also promoted the emerging field of 'Sustainability Science', an emerging focus at Arizona State University (Rindfuss et al., 2004), latterly applying it to the landscape in the Phoenix metropolitan area, including vegetation types, land cover change, and microclimates.

He has a lifelong interest in the promotion of geography as an academic discipline in the USA, and the development of geographic literacy. He lists, among his hobbies, "entertaining grad students", and he has supervised at least 30 PhDs through to successful careers, and been their great supporters.

'''Buda''' ({{IPA-hu|ˈbudɒ}}; [[German language|German]]: ''Ofen'', [[Croatian language|Croatian]]: ''Budim'', [[Serbian language|Serbian]]: ''Будим'', [[Slovak language|Slovak]]: ''Budín'', [[Turkish language|Turkish]]: ''Budin'') was the ancient capital of the [[Kingdom of Hungary]] and since 1873 has been the western part of the [[Hungary|Hungarian]] capital [[Budapest]], on the west bank of the [[Danube]]. Buda comprises a third of Budapest’s total territory and is in fact mostly wooded. Landmarks include [[Buda Castle]], the [[Citadella]], and [[President of Hungary]]'s residence [[Sándor Palace]].

== Demographics ==
[[File:Flag of Buda (pre-1873).svg|left|thumb|Flag of Buda before 1873.&lt;ref name="symbols"&gt;{{cite book|last=|first=|editor-first=András|editor-last=Nyerges|title=Pest-Buda, Budapest szimbólumai|trans-title=Budapest arms &amp; colours: throughout the centuries|year=1998|publisher=Budapest Főváros Levéltára|location=Budapest|page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
[[File:Buda város címere 1703.JPG|right|thumb|150px|Historical coat of arms of Buda, used between 1703-1873.&lt;ref name="symbols" /&gt;]]
The Buda fortress and palace were built by King [[Béla IV of Hungary]] in 1247, and were the nucleus round which the town of Buda was built, which soon gained great importance, and became in 1361 the capital of Hungary.&lt;ref&gt;The Budapest article of Encyclopædia Britannica 1911&lt;/ref&gt;

While [[Pest, Hungary|Pest]] was mostly Hungarian in the 15th century, Buda had a German majority;&lt;ref name=Pallas&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mek.iif.hu/porta/szint/egyeb/lexikon/pallas/html/016/pc001672.html#9|title=Budapest|work=A Pallas Nagy Lexikona|language=Hungarian|accessdate=2009-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; however according to the Hungarian Royal Treasury, it had a Hungarian majority with a sizeable German minority in 1495.&lt;ref&gt;Károly Kocsis (DSc, University of Miskolc) – Zsolt Bottlik (PhD, Budapest University) – Patrik Tátrai: Etnikai térfolyamatok a Kárpát-medence határon túli régióiban, Magyar Tudományos Akadémia (Hungarian Academy of Sciences) – Földrajtudományi Kutatóintézet (Academy of Geographical Studies); Budapest; 2006.; {{ISBN|963-9545-10-4}}, CD Atlas&lt;/ref&gt; Buda became part of [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]]-ruled central Hungary from 1541 to 1686. It was the capital of the province of [[Budin Eyalet|Budin]] during the Ottoman era. By the middle of the seventeenth century Buda had become majority Muslim, largely resulting from an influx of Balkan Muslims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Faroqhi|first=Suraiya |editor-last=İnalcık |editor-first=Halil |editor2=Donald Quataert |title=An Economic and Social History of the Ottoman Empire, 1300-1914 |volume=2 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |date=1994 |pages=440 |chapter=Crisis and Change, 1590-1699 |isbn=0-521-57456-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1686, two years after the unsuccessful siege of Buda, a renewed European campaign was started to enter Buda, which was formerly the capital of medieval Hungary. This time, the [[Holy League (1684)|Holy League]]'s army was twice as large, containing over 74,000 men, including [[Germans|German]], [[Dutch people|Dutch]], [[Hungarians|Hungarian]], [[English people|English]], [[Spanish people|Spanish]], [[Czechs|Czech]], [[French people|French]], [[Croats|Croat]], [[Burgundy|Burgundian]], [[Danish people|Danish]] and [[Swedish people|Swedish]] soldiers, along with other [[Europeans]] as volunteers, artillerymen, and officers, the Christian forces reconquered Buda (see [[Battle of Buda (1686)|Siege of Buda]]).

After the reconquest of Buda, bourgeoisie from different parts of southern Germany moved into the almost deserted city. Germans — also clinging to their language — partly crowded out, partly assimilated the Hungarians and Serbians they had found here.&lt;ref name=Pallas/&gt; As the rural population moved into Buda, in the 19th century slowly Hungarians became the majority there.

'''Eliza Ruhamah Scidmore''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|s|ɪ|d|m|ɔːr}})&lt;ref&gt;Michael E. Ruane, "[https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/cherry-blossoms-champion-eliza-scidmore-led-a-life-of-adventure/2012/02/22/gIQAAzHEAS_story.html Cherry blossoms’ champion, Eliza Scidmore, led a life of adventure]," ''Washington Post'', March 13, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; (1856–1928) was an [[United States|American]] writer, photographer and geographer, who became the first female board member of the [[National Geographic Society]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Coming to Shore: Northwest Coast Ethnology, Traditions, and Visions |last1=Mauzé |first1=Marie |last2=Harkin |first2=Michael Eugene |last3=Kan |first3=Sergei |year=2004 |publisher=University of Nebraska Press |isbn=0-8032-3230-6 |pages=206 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=__kvNdECyrAC&amp;pg=PA206&amp;dq=%22national+geographic+society%22+%2B(%22Eliza+Ruhamah+Scidmore%22+OR+%22Eliza+Scidmore%22)&amp;num=100&amp;as_brr=3&amp;ie=ISO-8859-1&amp;sig=uh9Y-x-2TlzVopDpyznIrSNsVwo |accessdate=26 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; She visited [[Japan]] many times between 1885 and 1928.

Scidmore was born October 14, 1856 in [[Clinton, Iowa]].  She attended [[Oberlin College]]. Her interest in travel was aided by her brother, [[George Hawthorne Scidmore]], a career diplomat who served in the Far East from 1884 to 1922. Eliza was often able to accompany her brother on assignments and his diplomatic position gave her entree into regions inaccessible to ordinary travelers.

It was on their return to [[Washington, D.C.]] in 1885 that Eliza had her famous idea of planting Japanese cherry trees in the capital.  Scidmore found little interest in her cherry tree idea, but more in her impressions of [[Alaska]], the subject of her first book, ''Alaska, Its Southern Coast and the Sitkan Archipelago'' (1885).  She joined the [[National Geographic Society]] in 1890, soon after its founding, and became a regular correspondent and later the Society's first female trustee.

Further eastern travels resulted in ''Jinrikisha Days in Japan'', published in 1891.  It was followed by a short guidebook, ''Westward to the Far East'' (1892).  A trip to [[Java]] resulted in ''Java, the Garden of the East'' (1897) and visits to [[China]] and [[India]] resulted in several ''[[National Geographic Magazine]]'' articles and two books, ''China, the Long-Lived Empire'' (1900), and ''Winter India'' (1903).

Another stay in Japan during the [[Russo-Japanese War]] became the basis for Scidmore's only known work of fiction, ''As the Hague Ordains'' (1907).  The novel purports to be the account of a Russian prisoner's wife who joins her husband at the prisoner's hospital in [[Matsuyama, Ehime|Matsuyama]].

Scidmore's cherry blossom scheme began to bear fruit when incoming first lady [[Helen Taft]] took an interest in the idea in 1909.  With the first lady's active support, plans moved quickly, but the first effort had to be aborted due to concerns about infestation.  Subsequent efforts proved successful, however, and today many visitors enjoy the [[sakura]] of [[West Potomac Park]] and other areas of the capital, particularly during the [[National Cherry Blossom Festival]].

In support of the new conservation movement in the United States, Scidmore wrote a letter to the editor of Century Magazine in Sept. 1893 on "Our New National Forest Reserves" detailing the meaning and consequences of forest preservation on behalf of the public good.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unz.org/Pub/Century-1893sep-00792a02|title="Our New National Forest Reserves" by Eliza Ruhamah Scidmore, The Century Magazine, September 1893|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After ''As the Hague Ordains'', Scidmore published no new books and a dwindling number of articles for ''National Geographic'', the last being a 1914 article entitled "Young Japan."  She died in [[Geneva]], Switzerland on November 3, 1928, at the age of 72. Her grave is at the [[Foreign cemeteries in Japan#Yokohama Foreign General Cemetery|Yokohama Foreign Cemetery]], [[Yokohama]], Japan next to the graves of her mother and brother.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.city.yokohama.lg.jp/naka/english/nwtn/nwtn2012/122.pdf|title=The Story of the Cherry Blossom Trees that Served as a Bridge between Japan and the US Cherry Blossom Tree Donation 100th Anniversary|date=May 31, 2012|work=Naka Ward Town News|publisher=Yokohama City|language=English|accessdate=18 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <comment>The removed passage directly contradicts much of the information presented the page, and is just not accurate. To say that Finland stayed out of the Soviet sphere of influence, contradicts the introduction of this page which states. "Finlandization (to become like Finland) is the process by which one powerful country makes a smaller neighboring country abide by the former's foreign policy rules, while allowing it to keep its nominal independence and its own political system."</comment>

'''Finlandization''' ({{lang-fi|suomettuminen}}; {{lang-sv|finlandisering}}; {{lang-de|Finnlandisierung}}) is the process by which one powerful country makes a smaller neighboring country abide by the former's foreign policy rules, while allowing it to keep its nominal independence and its own political system.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Asia's Cauldron|last=Kaplan|first=Robert D.|publisher=Random House Trade Paperbacks|year=2015|isbn=978-0-8129-8480-4|location=USA|pages=26}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term means "to become like [[Finland]]" referring to the influence of the [[Soviet Union]] on Finland's policies during the [[Cold War]].

The term is generally considered [[pejorative]], originating in [[West Germany|West German]] political debate of the late 1960s and 1970s. As the term was used in Germany and other [[NATO]] countries, it referred to the decision of a [[country]] not to challenge a more powerful neighbour in foreign politics, while maintaining national [[sovereignty]].  It is commonly used in reference to Finland's policies in relation to the [[Soviet Union]] during the Cold War, but it can refer more generally to similar international relations, such as [[Denmark]]'s attitude toward Germany between 1871 and 1945, or the policies of the Swiss government towards [[Nazi Germany]] until the end of World War II.

== Origin and international usage ==
In Germany, the term was used mainly by proponents of closer adaptation to [[United States|US]] policies, chiefly [[Franz Josef Strauss]], but was initially coined in scholarly debate, and made known by the German political scientists [[Walter Hallstein]] and [[Richard Löwenthal]], reflecting feared effects of withdrawal of US troops from Germany. It came to be used in the debate of the NATO countries in response to [[Willy Brandt]]'s attempts to [[Ostpolitik|normalise relations with East Germany]], and the following widespread scepticism in Germany against NATO's [[Dual-Track Decision]]. Later, after the [[fall of the Soviet Union]], the term has been used in [[Finland]] for the post-1968 radicalisation in the latter half of the [[Urho Kekkonen]] era.

==Finnish perception==
[[File:1970 - Lenin.jpg|thumb|In April 1970, a Finnish stamp was issued in honor of the 100th anniversary of the birth of Vladimir Lenin and then the Lenin Symposium held in Tampere.]]
In Finland, the term "Finlandization" was perceived as blunt criticism,{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}} stemming from an inability to understand the practicalities of how a small nation needs to deal with an adjacent [[superpower]] without losing its [[sovereignty]]. These practicalities existed especially because of the lingering effect of Russian rule in their time, before the [[Finns]] first gained sovereignty, and because of the precarious power balance eastwards, springing from a geographically extended yet sparsely populated state with a traditionally imperialist superpower right across the eastern border.

The reason Finland engaged in Finlandization was primarily [[Realpolitik]]: to survive. On the other hand, the threat of the Soviet Union was used also in Finland's domestic politics in a way that possibly deepened Finlandization (playing the so-called ''idänkortti'', "east card"). Finland cut such a deal with [[Joseph Stalin]]'s government in the late 1940s, and it was largely respected by both parties—and to the gain of both parties—until the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991. While the Finnish political and intellectual elite mostly understood the term to refer more to the foreign policy problems of other countries, and meant mostly for domestic consumption in the speaker's own country, many ordinary Finns considered the term highly offensive.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} The Finnish political cartoonist [[Kari Suomalainen]] once explained Finlandization as ''the art of bowing to the East without [[mooning]] the West''.

===Historical background===
Finland's foreign politics before this deal had been varied: independence from [[Imperial Russia]] with support of [[German Empire|Imperial Germany]] in 1917; participation in the [[Russian Civil War]] (without official declaration of war) alongside the [[Triple Entente]] 1918–1920; a non-ratified alliance with [[Poland]] in 1922; association with the neutralist and [[democracy|democratic]] [[Scandinavia]]n countries in the 1930s ended by the [[Winter War]] (1939); and finally in 1940, a rapprochement with [[Nazi Germany]], the only power able and willing to help Finland against the expansionist Soviet Union, which lead to the nation's [[Continuation War|re-entry into the Second World War]] in 1941.

The [[Wehrmacht]]'s defeat in the [[Battle of Stalingrad]] led Finland to basically revert to its 19th-century traditions, which had been perceived as highly successful until the [[Russification of Finland]] (1899–1905).  Finland's leaders realised that opposing the Soviets head-on was no longer feasible. No [[power (international)|international power]] was able to give the necessary support. [[Nazi Germany]], Finland's chief supporter against Russia, was losing the war. [[Sweden]] was not big enough, and its leadership was wary of confronting Russia. The [[Western countries|western powers]] were allied with the Soviet Union. Thus Finland had to face its big neighbour on its own, without any greater power's protection.  As in the 19th century, Finland chose not to challenge Imperial Russia's foreign policy, but exerted caution to keep its [[independence]].

===Paasikivi doctrine===
{{see also|Paasikivi–Kekkonen doctrine}}
After the [[Paris Peace Treaties, 1947|Paris Peace Treaty]] of 1947, Finland succeeded in retaining [[democracy]] and [[parliamentarism]], despite the heavy political pressure on Finland's foreign and internal affairs by the Soviet Union. [[Foreign relations of Finland|Finland's foreign relations]] were guided by the doctrine formulated by [[Juho Kusti Paasikivi]], emphasising the necessity to maintain a good and trusting relationship with the Soviet Union.

Finland signed an [[Finno-Soviet Treaty of 1948|Agreement of Friendship, Cooperation, and Mutual Assistance]] with the Soviet Union in April 1948, under which Finland was obliged to resist armed attacks by "Germany or its allies" against Finland, or against the Soviet Union through Finland, and, if necessary, ask for Soviet military aid to do so. At the same time, the agreement recognised Finland's desire to remain outside [[Great Power|great power]] conflicts, allowing the country to adopt a policy of [[neutral country|neutrality]] during the [[Cold War]].

As a consequence, Finland did not participate in the [[Marshall Plan]] and took neutral positions on Soviet overseas initiatives. By keeping very cool relations to [[NATO]] and western military powers in general, Finland could fend off Soviet pressure for affiliation to the [[Warsaw Pact]].

===Self-censorship and excessive Soviet adaptation===
However, from the political scene following the post-1968 radicalisation, the Soviet adaptation spread to the editors of [[mass media]], sparking strong forms of self-control, [[self-censorship]] and pro-Soviet attitudes. Most of the élite of media and politics shifted their attitudes to match the values that the Soviets were thought to favor and approve.

Only after the ascent of [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] to Soviet leadership in 1985 did mass media in Finland gradually begin to criticise the Soviet Union more. When the Soviet Union allowed non-communist governments to take power in Eastern Europe, Gorbachev suggested they could look to Finland as an example to follow.

== Censorship ==
In the years immediately after the war (1944–1946), the Soviet part of the allied control commission demanded that public libraries should remove from circulation more than 1,700 books that were deemed anti-Soviet, and bookstores were given catalogs of banned books.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Ekholm |first=Kai |year=2001 |title=Political Censorship in Finnish Libraries in 1944–1946 |journal=Libraries &amp; Culture |volume=36 |issue=1 |pages=51–57 |doi=10.1353/lac.2001.0008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uta.fi/laitokset/kirjasto/oppimiskeskus/verkkoaineisto/inf/makinen.pdf Mäkinen, Ilkka. 2001. The golden age of Finnish public libraries : institutional, structural and ideological background since the 1960s]. P.131&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Valtion elokuvatarkastamo|Finnish Board of Film Classification]] likewise banned movies that it considered to be anti-Soviet.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}} Banned movies included ''[[One, Two, Three]]'' (1961 film), directed by [[Billy Wilder]], ''[[The Manchurian Candidate (1962 film)|The Manchurian Candidate]]'', directed by [[John Frankenheimer]] in 1962, ''[[One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich (film)|One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich]]'' 1970 by Finnish director [[Caspar Wrede]] and ''[[Born American]]'' by Finnish director [[Renny Harlin]] in 1986.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}

== Criticism ==
[[United States]] foreign policy experts consistently feared that [[Western Europe]] and [[Japan]] would be Finlandized, leading to a situation in which these key allies no longer supported the United States against the Soviet Union. The theory of [[bandwagoning]] provided support for the idea that if the United States was not able to provide strong and credible support for the [[Anti-communism|anti-communist]] positions of its allies, [[NATO]] and the U.S.–Japan alliance could collapse.

However, foreign policy scholars such as [[Eric Nordlinger]] in his book ''Isolationism Reconfigured'' have argued that "a vision of Finlandization in America's absence runs up squarely against the [[Europe]]an states' long-standing Communist antipathies and wariness of Moscow's peaceful wiles, valued national traditions and strong democratic institutions, as well as their size and wherewithal".&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.independent.org/publications/tir/article.asp?issueID=37&amp;articleID=489 Isolationism Reconfigured: American Foreign Policy for a New Century]", ''The Independent Review'', The Independent Institute.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5244">Fluvio refers to things related to rivers and glacial refers to something that is of ice. '''Fluvio-glacial''' refers to the [[meltwater]] created when a [[glacier]] melts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/us/fluvio-|title=fluvio- - definition of fluvio- in English {{!}} Oxford Dictionaries|website=Oxford Dictionaries {{!}} English|access-date=2017-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/glacial|title=glacial - definition... of glacial in English {{!}} Oxford Dictionaries|website=Oxford Dictionaries {{!}} English|access-date=2017-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fluvio-glacial processes can occur on the surface and within the glacier. The [[Deposition (geology)|deposits]] that happen within the glacier are revealed after the entire glacier melts or partially retreats. Fluvio-glacial [[landform]]s and [[erosion]]al surfaces include: [[outwash plain]]s, [[kame]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s, kame terraces, [[Kettle (landform)|kettle holes]], [[esker]]s, [[varve]]s, and [[proglacial lake]]s.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.coolgeography.co.uk/A-level/AQA/Year%2012/Cold%20environs/Fluvioglacial/Fluvioglacial%20landforms.htm|title=Fluvioglacial Landforms|last=|first=|date=|website=Coolgeography.co.uk|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Landforms ==

=== Outwash Plain ===
An outwash plain is both an erosional and depositional surface created by meltwater coming from the glacier. These plains are found in front of the glaciers and are typically characterized by small [[Braided river|braided streams]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The streams are usually small and braided because the [[sediment]] size varies and the original stream gets broken up.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Since these streams [[meander]] around, the erosion happens laterally (left to right)  instead of vertically (up and down).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; These plains are usually found beyond the [[Terminal moraine|end moraine]] deposited by the glacier.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Kame and Kame Terrace ===
[[Kame]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s are small hills that consist of sediments ranging from sands to gravels.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Geomorphology|last=Gutierrez|first=Mateo|publisher=CRC Press|year=2013|isbn=|location=Leiden|pages=538–545}}&lt;/ref&gt; Intraglacial movement of water carries sediments and deposits them inside cavaties, or holes, in the glacier; once the glacier melts or retreats, the kames is left behind as a deposit. These hills can range in size and be up to 50 m tall and 400 m wide.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; A kame terrace is a relatively flat surface of sediment that was deposited between the valley surface and the glacier. When kames, kame surfaces, and other fluvio-glacial landforms are combined into one landscape, it is called a kame complex or glacial [[Karst|karst topography]].

=== Kettle Holes ===
[[Kettle (landform)|Kettle holes]] are typically formed when a chunk of ice that came from the glacier is buried under fluvio-glacial sediments.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/bitesize/higher/geography/physical/lithosphere/revision/7/|title=BBC - Higher Bitesize Geography - Lithosphere : Revision, Page7|access-date=2017-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Once the ice melts, the sediments fall and form a depression that can later be filled with rainwater and form [[Kettle (landform)|kettle lakes]]. Kettle holes can often be found in the outwash plain of a glacier.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Kettle holes can be anywhere from 5 m to 30&amp;nbsp;km wide.

=== Eskers ===
Eskers can be describes as long, curved ridges made up of sands and gravels.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Soil_Geomorphology.html?id=H9FSveDbpbsC|title=Soil Geomorphology|last=Gerrard|first=A J|date=|website=Google Books|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; These surfaces were created by intraglacial streams carrying and depositing sediments as they flow through the glacier. These landforms can range from 100 m to 500&amp;nbsp;km long and 3 m to 200 m tall.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Varves ===
Varves are a depositional feature of a fluvio-glacial movement. They are layers of annual sediment deposits. The sizes of the sediments vary and depend on the volume of the streams, but are usually associated with mud deposits ([[silt]] and [[clay]]).&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/science/varved-deposit|title=varved deposit {{!}} geology|work=Encyclopædia Britannica|access-date=2017-05-12|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The color and amount of the sediment deposited also varies depending upon the season; summer deposits typically have larger volumes of deposition and are characterized as being light, whereas winter deposits are usually the opposite.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Winter deposits are fairly uncommon because the water is frozen into ice again.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== Proglacial Lakes ===
[[Proglacial lake]]s form as meltwater trapped behind a glacial feature such as an end moraine.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; These lakes have an intake of sediment deposited by streams within the glacier and their deposits are recorded within the varves.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5124">'''Healthy city''' is a term used in [[public health]] and [[urban design]] to stress the impact of policy on [[health|human health]]. Its modern form derives from a [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) initiative on Healthy Cities and Villages in 1986, but has a history dating back to the mid 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;Niyi Awofeso. [http://www.scielosp.org/scielo.php?pid=S0042-96862003000300013&amp;script=sci_arttext  The Healthy Cities approach — reflections on a framework for improving global health.] ''Bull World Health Organ'' 2003; 81(3).&lt;/ref&gt; The term was developed in conjunction with the [[European Union]], but rapidly became international as a way of establishing healthy public policy at the local level through [[health promotion]].&lt;ref&gt;O'Neill M, Simard P. [http://heapro.oxfordjournals.org/content/21/2/145.full Choosing indicators to evaluate Healthy Cities projects: a political task?] ''Health Promotion International'' 2006; 21(2): 145-152.&lt;/ref&gt; It emphasises the multi-dimensionality of [[health]] as laid out in WHO's constitution and, more recently, the [[Ottawa Charter for Health Promotion]].&lt;ref name="whohc"&gt;World Health Organization.[http://www.euro.who.int/healthy-cities Healthy Cities and urban governance.] Copenhagen: WHO Europe.&lt;/ref&gt; An alternative term is [[Healthy community design|Healthy Communities]], or ''Municipios saludables'' in parts of Latin America.

==Approaches==
Many jurisdictions which have healthy community programmes and cities can apply to become a WHO-designated "Healthy City". WHO defines the Healthy City as:&lt;ref&gt;World Health Organization. [http://www.who.int/entity/healthpromotion/about/HPR%20Glossary%201998.pdf Health Promotion Glossary 1998.]&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"one that is continually creating and improving those physical and social environments and expanding those community resources which enable
people to mutually support each other in performing all the functions of life and in developing to their maximum potential."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Measuring the indices required, establishing standards and determining the impact of each component on health is difficult. In some regions such as Europe, a health impact assessment is a required piece of [[public policy]] development.&lt;ref&gt;WHO Europe. [http://www.euro.who.int/healthimpact Health impact assessment methods and strategies.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Erica Ison. [http://heapro.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/short/24/suppl_1/i64  The introduction of health impact assessment in the WHO European Healthy Cities Network.] ''Health Promotion International'' 2009; 24(Supplement 1):i64-i71.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are many networks of healthy cities, including in Europe&lt;ref&gt;WHO Europe. [http://www.euro.who.int/en/what-we-do/health-topics/environment-and-health/urban-health/partners WHO European Healthy Cities Network.]&lt;/ref&gt; and internationally, such as the [[Alliance for Healthy Cities]]. A key feature is ensuring that the [[social determinants of health]] are taken into consideration in urban design and urban governance. For example, "[[urbanization]] and health" was the theme of the 2010 [[World Health Day]].&lt;ref&gt;World Health Organization.[http://www.euro.who.int/worldhealthday/20100325_1 World Health Day 2010.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100407222812/http://www.euro.who.int/worldhealthday/20100325_1 |date=2010-04-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt; One tool in developing healthy cities is [[social entrepreneurship]].&lt;ref&gt;Evelyne de Leeuw. [http://heapro.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/14/3/261  Healthy Cities: urban social entrepreneurship for health.] ''Health Promotion International'' 1999; 14(3): 261-270.&lt;/ref&gt;

This article provides information on the '''hotels in Istanbul''', [[Turkey]], including history of the hospitality industry in the city, brief overview of the current status of [[Istanbul]]'s hospitality industry, information on the local hotels, as well as information on the international chain hotels in the city.

==History==
[[Image:Tokatliyan.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Historic "Hotel M. Tokatlıyan" in [[Beyoğlu]].]]
Contemporary hotel management in Istanbul started in the second half of the 19th century, as the [[Orient Express]] extended its non-stop service from Paris to Istanbul on 1 June 1889 (with Istanbul becoming one of the two original endpoints of the timetabled service of the [[Orient Express]]) and the city became, as a result, a tourist destination. In 1892, a group of local investors, in partnership with the [[Wagons-Lits]] company, opened [[Hotel Pera Palace]] in [[Beyoglu]] district, which was designed by the famous [[Levantines|Levantine]] architect of Istanbul, [[Alexander Vallaury]]. Also in 1892, The Grand Hotel de Londres was opened by two local partners, L. Adamopoulos and N. Aperghis, in the place of the former residence of the Glavany family in [[Beyoğlu]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.londrahotel.net/history.html|title=Grand Hotel de Londres History|publisher=(c) Copyright 2009 Grand Hotel de Londres|accessdate=17 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly afterwards, a series of hotels, including [[Pera Museum|Bristol Hotel]] (1893) and [[Tokatlıyan Hotels|"Hotel M. Tokatlıyan"]] (1897), were opened in the same district.

While the new hotels were being opened in [[Beyoğlu]] district, [[Sirkeci]] quarter within the old city quickly adapted to this new tendency and the old inns in the neighbourhood were gradually transformed into hotels at the beginning of the 20th century. Other districts of the city followed this trend and the number of hotels in Istanbul was more than 50 in the year 1910.

Similar progress occurred in the following years in the cities of [[İzmir]] and [[Ankara]], while the development of hotel management was relatively slow in the rest of [[Anatolia]]n cities.

During the Republican era, in the 1950s, opening of hotels of various types gained speed. The most important event of this period was the opening of [[Hilton Istanbul Bosphorus]] in 1954.&lt;ref name="Altun"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.hilton.com.tr/55yil/pdf/Hilton_Kitap.pdf|first=Mehmet|last=Altun|title=Hilton Istanbul Bosphorus: Hilton Istanbul'un anı defterinden 55 yıl/55 years in the chronicles of Hilton Istanbul Bosphorus|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131230235002/http://www.hilton.com.tr/55yil/pdf/Hilton_Kitap.pdf|archivedate=2013-12-30|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of the development of transportation and the domestic/outbound tourism, numerous new hotels were opened in the 1960s. The same development continued during the 1970s and 1980s as well, with this period seeing the opening of such large 5-star hotels as [[Sheraton Hotels and Resorts|Sheraton]] Istanbul and [[Etap Hotels|Etap]] Marmara (later rebranded as Ceylan [[InterContinental]] Istanbul and The Marmara Taksim hotels, respectively).

In the 1990s and 2000s, along with the rapid development of different categories of tourism in the country, such as the congress tourism, the [[health tourism]], the [[religious tourism]], etc., a new wave of hotel openings took place in the city. Hotels opened during this period of time included, among many others, [[Conrad Istanbul Bosphorus]], [[Sultanahmet Jail|Four Seasons Istanbul Hotel in Sultanahmet]], [[Ritz-Carlton]] Istanbul Hotel and [[Sheraton Hotels and Resorts|Sheraton]] Istanbul Maslak Hotel.

Currently, there are numerous ongoing and planned hotel projects at various stages of development aimed at meeting the rising demand for accommodation generated by the global touristic status of Istanbul as the 9th most visited city in the world by the number of international tourist arrivals&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;[[Tourism#Most-visited cities by international tourist arrivals]]&lt;/ref&gt; and the 9th most popular congress destination in the world.&lt;ref name="iccaworld.com"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.iccaworld.com/dcps/doc.cfm?docid=1520|title=International Association Meetings Market, Statistics Report 2002-2011|publisher=International Congress and Convention Association|format=PDF|accessdate=28 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="icvbbulletin.org"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.icvbbulletin.org/index.php/icvb-news/389-istanbul-solidifies-its-ranking-as-a-top-ten-international-congress-destination|work=Official Newsletter of Istanbul Convention &amp; Visitors Bureau (©Copyright 2011, www.icvbbulletin.org)|title=Istanbul Solidifies Its Ranking As A Top Ten International Congress Destination|date=May 2012|accessdate=26 December 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131012033554/http://www.icvbbulletin.org/index.php/icvb-news/389-istanbul-solidifies-its-ranking-as-a-top-ten-international-congress-destination|archivedate=12 October 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With 11.842.983 million international visitors visiting Istanbul in the year 2014 (registering a 13.1% year-on-year increase compared with the previous year),&lt;ref name="ftnnews.com"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://ftnnews.com/news-from-turkey/25815-record-breaking-number-of-tourists-in-istanbul-in-2014.html|title=Record-breaking number of tourists in Istanbul in 2014 |publisher=Focus on Travel News (www.ftnnews.com)|date=8 January 2015|accessdate=2 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; the number of international visitors to Istanbul increased a further 7.5% in the first eight months of 2015, reaching 8.414.096 million international visitors to the city during the January–August 2015 period of time.&lt;ref name="İstanbul'un turist sayısı arttı"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.turizmguncel.com/haber/istanbul'a-gelen-turist-sayisindaki-artis-suruyor-h24676.html|title=İstanbul'a gelen turist sayısındaki artış sürüyor|publisher=TurizmGuncel.com|date=7 September 2015|accessdate=7 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Brief information==
Every possible accommodation style is available in Istanbul, from the hostel dormitories and mid-range hotels to the world-class luxury hotels. Although reasonable compared to the [[Europe]]an standards, the rates are more expensive than in the rest of the country.

While the majority of the 5-star hotels concentrate within modern districts like [[Beyoğlu]], [[Şişli]] and [[Beşiktaş]], the 4-star hotels are generally located within the historical peninsula. The majority of hotels generally congregate in the vicinity of [[Sultan Ahmed Mosque|Sultanahmet]] and [[Hagia Sophia]]. Numerous hotels occupying historical buildings are situated in this district. Budget hotels are generally found in, both, modern and historical districts.

In 2006, the total number of tourism operation licensed hotels in Istanbul were 283. Of the 283 hotels, 28 were 5-star, 63 were 4-star, 81 were 3-star, 91 were 2-star hotels, and 20 were 1-star hotels. Additionally, there were 55 other accommodation establishments in the city, mainly consisting of special licence hotels, [[motel]]s, [[camping]] grounds, [[boarding house]]s, [[Apartment hotel|apart]]s, and [[boutique hotel]]s.

At the end of 2010, according to the data of the Association of the Touristic Hotels and Investors (TUROB) of the Republic of Turkey, 766 accommodation establishments of different categories in Istanbul (licensed by the Ministry of Tourism and Culture of Turkey and/or the municipality of Istanbul) had the total of 46,652 rooms and 93,299 beds.&lt;ref name="turizmdebusabah"&gt;[http://www.turizmdebusabah.com/haber_detay.aspx?haberNo=53925 TUROB, İstanbul'un konaklama potansiyelini analiz etti&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; That capacity alone was sufficient to accommodate the annual volume of 10&amp;nbsp;million tourists.

At the same time, another 51 new hotels (of which 25 were 5-star hotels) were at various stages of development at the end of 2010, soon to add another 9,512 rooms and 19,800 beds to the already existing capacity. With the completion of these new hotels, Istanbul's accommodation capacity will have reached, within a few years, the total of 817 hotels, 56,164 rooms and 113,99 beds.&lt;ref name="turizmdebusabah"/&gt;

==Local hotels==

While many of the locally-branded hotels which are operated by the local Turkish hotel chains or investors are built by individual investors, several national hotel chains dominate the local hotels market. These local hotel chains include Titanic Hotels (operating 5 hotels in Istanbul), Tempo Hotels (operating 5 hotels in Istanbul), The Green Park Hotels (operating 4 hotels in Istanbul), '''Dedeman Hotels''' (operating 4 hotels in Istanbul), The House Hotels (operating 4 hotels in Istanbul), '''The Sofa Hotel''' In the pulsating heart of the city, a member of prestigious Design Hotels™ chain and one of Europe’s top 10 art hotels.'''Divan Hotels''' (operating 4 hotels in Istanbul), Elite World Hotels (operating 4 hotels in Istanbul), The Marmara Collection Hotels (operating 3 hotels in Istanbul), etc.

==International chain hotels==
The international chain hotels market in Istanbul dates back to 1955 when [[Hilton Hotels]] chain opened its first international hotel outside the U.S., in Istanbul, on 10 June 1955. The opening was hosted by the founder of Hilton Hotels chain, [[Conrad Hilton]], and saw the attendance of the retinue of international celebrities specially invited to Istanbul for the opening, including [[Olivia de Havilland]], [[Irene Dunne]], [[Sonja Henie]], [[Ann Miller]], [[Terry Moore (actress)|Terry Moore]], and many others.&lt;ref name="Altun"/&gt; To this day, [[Hilton Istanbul Bosphorus]] holds the distinct eminence of being the longest operating Hilton hotel outside the U.S.&lt;ref name="hilton"&gt;[http://hilton.com.tr/en/Hilton-Istanbul/default.aspx Hilton İstanbul&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111007082804/http://hilton.com.tr/en/Hilton-Istanbul/default.aspx |date=2011-10-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

60&amp;nbsp;years later, Istanbul retains its strong attraction for the international hotel chains as the 9th most visited city in the world by the number of international tourist arrivals&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; and the 9th most popular congress destination in the world,&lt;ref name="iccaworld.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="icvbbulletin.org"/&gt; hosting, as of September 2015, 106 operating international chain hotels, with further 31 such hotels scheduled to open before late 2017 (detailed data for these hotels is listed in the table which follows below).

With 11.842.983 million international visitors visiting Istanbul in the year 2014 (registering a 13.1% year-on-year increase compared with the previous year),&lt;ref name="ftnnews.com"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://ftnnews.com/news-from-turkey/25815-record-breaking-number-of-tourists-in-istanbul-in-2014.html|title=Record-breaking number of tourists in Istanbul in 2014 |publisher=Focus on Travel News (www.ftnnews.com)|date=8 January 2015|accessdate=2 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; the number of international visitors to Istanbul increased a further 7.5% in the first eight months of 2015, reaching 8.414.096 million international visitors to the city during the January–August 2015 period of time.&lt;ref name="İstanbul'un turist sayısı arttı"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.turizmguncel.com/haber/istanbul'a-gelen-turist-sayisindaki-artis-suruyor-h24676.html|title=İstanbul'a gelen turist sayısındaki artış sürüyor|publisher=TurizmGuncel.com|date=7 September 2015|accessdate=7 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The international chain hotels market in Istanbul is well structured, encompassing the entire range of accommodation offerings, from the quality budget hotels ([[Best Western]], [[Hotel Ibis|Ibis]], [[Hampton Inn|Hampton by Hilton]], etc.) to the luxury Far East hotel chains ([[Shangri-La Hotels and Resorts|Shangri-La]], [[Mandarin Oriental Hotel Group|Mandarin Oriental]], [[Fairmont Raffles Hotels International|Raffles]], etc.)

Contemporary hotel chains/brands [[W Hotels|W]] (of Starwood parent company) and [[Marriott International|Edition]] (of Marriott parent company) opened their first hotels in Europe in Istanbul ([[W Hotels|W]] in April 2008&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://travel.nytimes.com/2008/05/18/travel/18COMistanbul.html|work=The New York Times|first=Hilary|last=Howard|title=First W Hotel Opens in Europe|date=18 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Marriott International|Edition]] in February 2011&lt;ref name="luxurytravelmagazine"&gt;[http://www.luxurytravelmagazine.com/news-articles/the-istanbul-edition-premiering-april-2011-15545.php New Istanbul Edition Hotel Set to Debut in April 2011&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;), whereas the [[Viceroy Hotel Group|Viceroy]] Hotel Group will also debut its first European hotel in Istanbul in mid 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.viceroyhotelgroup.com/en/press/~/media/viceroy_hotel_group/Files/ViceroyIstanbulAnnouncemenRelease05012012.ashx|title=Viceroy Hotel Group Selected as Management Company for New Nef Bebeköy Development in Istanbul, Turkey|date=1 May 2012|format=PDF|publisher=©2012 Viceroy Hotel Group|accessdate=16 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The French chain of chic, [[Philippe Starck]]-designed hotels, [[Accor#Upscale brands|Mama Shelter]] Hotels, opened its first hotel outside France in Istanbul (after the hotels in [[Paris]], [[Marseille]], [[Lyon]] and [[Bordeaux]]),&lt;ref name="Mama Shelter Istanbul"&gt;{{cite web|title=Mama Shelter Istanbul|url=http://www.mamashelter.com/en/istanbul/|archive-url=https://archive.is/20130411072647/http://www.mamashelter.com/en/istanbul/|dead-url=yes|archive-date=11 April 2013|publisher=Mama Shelter Hotels|accessdate=10 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; while the Qatari [[Retaj]] chain of hotels also opened its first hotel in Europe in Istanbul (after the hotels in [[Qatar]] and [[Comoros]]).&lt;ref name="Retaj Royale Istanbul Hotel"&gt;{{cite web|title=Retaj Royale Istanbul Hotel|url=http://www.retaj-hotels.com/royaleistanbul/index.php|publisher=© Copyright Retaj Hotels &amp; Hospitality 2012|accessdate=1 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Thailand-based chain of hotels, U Hotels and Resorts, announced the opening of its first European hotel in Istanbul in early 2016, after the hotels in [[Thailand]], [[Indonesia]], [[India]], [[Laos]] and [[Vietnam]].&lt;ref name="Travel Daily Media"&gt;{{cite news|title=Thailand’s Absolute Hotels debuts in Europe|url=http://www.traveldailymedia.com/220198/thailands-absolute-hotels-debuts-in-europe/|work=Travel Daily Asia|publisher=Travel Daily Media|date=7 April 2015|accessdate=14 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The essential attraction of the city for the global hotel chains is further underlined by the fact that, as of September 2015, out of 57 international hotel chains/brands established in Istanbul, 27 of them (or 47.3%) had more than one hotel in the city.

'''ISO 3166-2:PE''' is the entry for [[Peru]] in [[ISO 3166-2]], part of the [[ISO 3166]] [[standardization|standard]] published by the [[International Organization for Standardization]] (ISO), which defines [[code]]s for the names of the principal [[country subdivision|subdivision]]s (e.g., [[province]]s or [[state (administrative division)|state]]s) of all [[country|countries]] coded in [[ISO 3166-1]].

Currently for Peru, ISO 3166-2 codes are defined for [[regions of Peru|25 regions and 1 municipality]]. The [[Lima Province|Metropolitan Municipality of Lima]] contains the capital of the country [[Lima]] and has special status equal to the regions.

Each code consists of two parts, separated by a hyphen. The first part is {{mono|PE}}, the [[ISO 3166-1 alpha-2]] code of Peru. The second part is three letters.

==Current codes==
Subdivision names are listed as in the ISO 3166-2 standard published by the ISO 3166 Maintenance Agency (ISO 3166/MA).

[[ISO 639-1]] codes are used to represent subdivision names in the following [[official language|administrative language]]s:
* (es): [[Spanish language|Spanish]]
* (qu): [[Quechua language|Quechua]]
* (ay): [[Aymara language|Aymara]]

'''Ilica street''' is one of the longest streets in [[Zagreb]], [[Croatia]]. The busy street is home to many shops and cultural sites and spans through most of the northwestern part of the city, from the [[Ban Jelačić Square]] in the [[city centre]] westward to the [[Vrapče, Zagreb|Vrapče]] district. The street is 5.66 km long, making it the third longest street in the city.&lt;ref name="JL"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.jutarnji.hr/vijesti/zagreb/ulice-koje-zbunjuju-postare-spajaju-parove-i-izluduju-susjede/2862398/ | title=Ulice koje zbunjuju poštare, spajaju parove i izluđuju susjede | date=20 July 2009 | language=Croatian | accessdate=2017-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9580">'''Imre E. Quastler''' is an American historical transportation geographer and an authority on aspects of regional transportation systems in the United States. He is [[Emeritus Professor]] of Geography in the Department of Geography at [[San Diego State University]]. He writes professionally under the name I. E. Quastler.

==Early life==

In mid-1939 Quastler's parents and sister moved from [[Germany]] to [[Japan]], taking one of the last passenger ships that left an Italian port for [[East Asia]] before [[World War II]] broke out. They were among those fleeing Germany as non-Aryans were being forced out of their jobs and some were being sent off to concentration camps. Before departing Germany, Quastler's father had found a job with a German engineering company in Japan.

Quastler was born in [[Tokyo]] on December 26, 1940. As the Allies advanced on Japan in 1944, Quastler and his mother and sister were relocated to the mountain village of [[Karuizawa]], about 80 miles west of Tokyo, which served as a detention area for foreigners. His father, employed in the war industry, remained in Tokyo. After the war, Quastler's father worked for the American occupation administration. The family relocated to the [[United States]] in 1951, eventually settling in [[Detroit]] where Quastler's father began a new career with Excello Corporation and eventually with [[General Motors]].

==Education and career==

Quastler obtained a B.A. degree from [[Wayne State University]] in Detroit in 1962. He earned an M.A. degree from [[Northwestern University]] in 1964, where he studied under [[William Garrison (geographer)|William Garrison]], a transportation geographer and a leader of the "quantitative revolution" that swept geography and other fields in the mid-twentieth century.&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, Trevor J. "Retheorizing Economic Geography: From the Quantitative Revolution to the 'Cultural Turn'," ''Annals of the Association of American Geographers'', Vol. 91, No. 3 (September 2001), pp.546-565.&lt;/ref&gt; While at Northwestern, he began specializing in transportation geography, but of the non-quantitative variety. In 1971, he received his [[Ph.D.]] in geography from the [[University of Kansas]], writing a dissertation on an historical geography topic.&lt;ref&gt;http://geography.sdsu.edu/People/Faculty/quastler.html&lt;/ref&gt;

While in the doctoral program at the University of Kansas, Quastler found that the history of railroad networks was under-studied, leaving an important part of the nation's economy poorly understood in terms in terms of operations, equipment, and network expansion and contraction. Research eventually led to publication of ''The Railroads of Lawrence, Kansas, 1854-1900'' in 1979, followed by eight other books on railroad historical geography.

Quastler joined the faculty of [[San Diego State University]] in 1968, remaining there until his retirement in 2002. Over the course of his academic career, he developed undergraduate and graduate level courses in transportation, urban and historical geography. His research interests included the history and development of both regional railroads and commuter (regional) airlines. Since his retirement he has continued writing and publishing on those subjects.  [[File:AT&amp;SF69-71justafterarrivalonSanDieganEarly9-67.tif|thumb|Atchison, Topeka, and Santa Fe Train upon Arrival in San Diego, 1967]]

Quastler was a popular teacher who mentored many students over the course of his career. He received the Outstanding Teacher Award at San Diego State University in 1987, and he was twice selected as Exemplary Academic Advisor at the university.

==Contribution to historical transportation geography==

Quastler is one of the few academic geographers to extensively study the historical development of railroad and airline transportation networks. Much of the work in the field has been accomplished by non-academic writers and railroad or airline aficionados. Quastler's career has centered on documentation of the development and operation of regional transportation systems, an area generally without rigorous academic work. Besides writing about those forms of transportation, he also photographed them for historical purposes, starting in the late 1950s. He has photographed hundreds of railroads and airlines, producing one of the largest collection of images of this type from the late 1960s to the present. Additionally, he has mapped the networks of the railroads and airlines he has studied, illustrating and explaining their changes over time. In 2010 [[San Diego Aerospace Museum]] scanned 355 images from among of his extensive collection of airliner slides, making them available to the public through Flicker. [[File:CherokeeAirlinesSkyvanN3419SAN4-69.jpg|thumb|Cherokee Airline Skyvan N3419 in San Diego, 1969]]

Quastler's study of regional transportation systems expanded to include commuter and regional airlines in 1968, shortly after he arrived at San Diego State College (later [[San Diego State University]]). His first book documented the rise of [[Swift Aire Lines]], which at the time served such cities as [[San Luis Obispo]], [[Santa Maria, California|Santa Maria]], [[Los Angeles]], [[San Francisco]] and [[Sacramento]]. This was the first in depth study of such airlines. During the 1970s and 1980s, Quastler documented the rise of several other commuter and regional airline networks, including [[Air Midwest]] and Scheduled Skyways. Quastler is currently conducting research for a book about the history and historical geography of [[Pacific Southwest Airlines]], the [[California]] firm that was one of the most successful intrastate airlines in the history of the industry.

In 1994, Quastler completed ''Commuter Airlines of the United States'', co-authored with [[R. E. G. Davies]] (1921-2011), a well-known writer of airline history. The book was sponsored and published by the Smithsonian Institution, and it remains the only comprehensive history written on the commuter airline industry.

==Publications==

Imre E. Quastler has published seventeen books and monographs and he has written twenty professional articles, reviews, and book chapters.  Among his articles, he feels that those published by the journal Kansas History are his most important. Quastler's latest book is ''Unusual Airlines and Airliners: A Photo Journal''. The author describes the book as consisting “primarily of more than 200 unusual airline and airliner photos taken by the author since 1969. The subjects range from commuter airliners, often photographed at unusual locations, to jumbo jets. They also range from airlines and services that lasted only a matter of months, to those of longer standing but which are probably unfamiliar to the average reader, whether in the United States, Canada, or elsewhere. Short essays describe the content and setting of each photograph.”&lt;ref&gt;Quastler, I., ''Unusual Airlines'', back cover.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Isle of Wight by John Rudd 1570.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Example of John Rudd's cartography]]
 
'''John Rudd''' ([[Yorkshire]] c. 1498 &amp;ndash; [[Durham, England|Durham]] 1579) was a [[Tudor period|Tudor]] [[cartographer]] and [[clergyman]].

In 1561 he was given two years' leave from his duties as [[Vicar]] of [[Dewsbury]] (1554-1570) and [[Rector (ecclesiastical)|Rector]] of [[Thornhill, West Yorkshire|Thornhill]] (1558-1570/78) to travel the country with the objective of mapping [[England]]. Although he does not appear to have completed this objective, it was completed by his [[apprentice]], [[Christopher Saxton]].  Saxton was employed by Rudd as a servant and it seems likely that he accompanied him on these trips, and learned draughting and surveying skills from his master. 

As well as various benefices, Rudd held a prebend at Durham. He and his wife Isabel (whom he had to renounce during [[Mary I of England|Mary]]'s reign) had at least three daughters and three sons, of whom John (1568-1640) followed his father in ministry. After becoming embroiled in controversy at Cambridge, leading to an appearance before the High Commission, the younger John settled down as Vicar of Shephall (near Stevenage) in Hertfordshire, where his memorial takes the form of a map [[Cartouche (design)|cartouche]], with a depiction of him as the Good Shepherd, brandishing a very episcopal-looking crook! He left bequests to [[Chorister School, Durham|Durham Cathedral School]] and various churches in Durham and Hertfordshire.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="21704">This is a '''list of countries by westernmost point''' on land (dependent territories included). A selection of dependent territories are listed in ''italics'' and are not ranked.

There are five countries with territory on both sides of the [[180th meridian]], and thus can be said to be both the westernmost and easternmost countries: [[Russia]], [[New Zealand]], [[Fiji]], [[United States]], and [[Kiribati]] (as well as [[Antarctica]]). Russia, New Zealand, and Fiji have most of their territories west of the 180th meridian, in the [[Eastern Hemisphere]], so they are considered in this article to belong to the [[List of countries by easternmost point|easternmost]] countries with their territory stretching east beyond the 180th meridian into the [[Western Hemisphere]]. Conversely, the United States and Kiribati have most of their territories east of the 180th meridian, into the Western Hemisphere, so they are considered to belong to the westernmost countries, with their territory stretching west beyond the 180th meridian into the Eastern Hemisphere.

'''Mariner 9''' ('''Mariner Mars '71''' / '''Mariner-I''') was an unmanned [[NASA]] space probe that contributed greatly to the exploration of [[Mars]] and was part of the [[Mariner program]]. Mariner 9 was launched toward Mars on May 30, 1971&lt;ref name=M9_trajectory&gt;{{cite web | url=http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/nmc/spacecraftOrbit.do?id=1971-051A | title=Mariner 9: Trajectory Information | publisher=[[National Space Science Data Center]] | accessdate=December 28, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=final_report&gt;{{cite web | url=https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/19730018117_1973018117.pdf | title=Mariner Mars 1971 Project Final Report | publisher=NASA Technical Reports Server | accessdate=December 28, 2011 | format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; from [[Cape Canaveral Air Force Station]] and reached the planet on November 14 of the same year,&lt;ref name=M9_trajectory /&gt;&lt;ref name=final_report /&gt; becoming the first spacecraft to orbit another planet&lt;ref name=M9_details&gt;{{cite web | url=http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/nmc/spacecraftDisplay.do?id=1971-051A | title=Mariner 9: Details | publisher=National Space Science Data Center | accessdate=December 28, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; – only narrowly beating the [[Soviet Union|Soviets']] [[Mars 2]] and [[Mars 3]], which both arrived within a month. After months of dust storms it managed to send back clear pictures of the surface.

Mariner 9 returned 7329 images over the course of its mission, which concluded in October 1972.&lt;ref name=log&gt;[http://mars.jpl.nasa.gov/programmissions/missions/log/ NASA PROGRAM &amp; MISSIONS Historical Log]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Objectives ==
{{unref|section|date=November 2018}}
[[File:Atlas I-CENTAUR.jpg|thumb|right|Mariner 9 launch]]

Mariner 9 was designed to continue the atmospheric studies begun by [[Mariner 6 and 7]], and to map over 70% of the Martian surface from the lowest altitude ({{Convert|1500|km|sp=us}}) and at the highest resolutions (from 1 kilometer per pixel to 100 meters per pixel) of any Mars mission up to that point. An infrared [[radiometer]] was included to detect heat sources in search of evidence of [[volcanic activity]]. It was to study temporal changes in the Martian atmosphere and surface. Mars' two moons were also to be analyzed. Mariner 9 more than met its objectives.

Under original plans, a dual mission was to be flown like Mariners 6–7, however the launch failure of [[Mariner 8]] ruined this scheme and forced NASA planners to fall back on a simpler one-probe mission. NASA still held out hope that another Mariner probe and [[Atlas-Centaur]] could be readied before the 1971 Mars [[launch window]] closed. A few logistical problems emerged, including the lack of an available Centaur payload shroud of the correct configuration for the Mariner probes, however there was a shroud in NASA's inventory which could be modified. [[Convair]] also had an available Centaur stage on hand and could have an Atlas readied in time, but the idea was ultimately abandoned for lack of funding.

Mariner 9 was mated to Atlas-Centaur AC-23 on May 9 with investigation into Mariner 8's failure ongoing. The malfunction was traced to a problem in the Centaur's pitch control servoamplifier and because it was not clear if the spacecraft itself had been responsible, [[Electromagnetic interference|RFI]] testing was conducted on Mariner 9 to ensure the probe was not releasing interference that could cause problems with the Centaur's electronics. All testing came back negative and on May 22, a tested and verified rate gyro package arrived from Convair and was installed in the Centaur.

Liftoff took place on May 30 at 5:23 PM EST. All launch vehicle systems performed normally and the Mariner separated from the Centaur at 13 minutes and 18 seconds after launch.

== Experiments ==
# Ultraviolet Spectrometer (UVS)
# Infrared Interferometer Spectrometer (IRIS)
# Celestial Mechanics (not a separate instrument; it relied upon tracking measurements including range, range rate, and Doppler)
# S-Band [[Occultation]] (not a separate instrument; experiment observed the attenuation of the communication signal as the orbiting satellite passed out of view)
# Infrared Radiometer (IRR)
# Visual Imaging System – in a lower orbit, half that of [[Mariner 6]] and [[Mariner 7]] flyby missions, and with a vastly improved imaging system, Mariner 9 achieved a resolution of {{convert|320|ft}} per [[pixel]], whereas previous Martian probes had achieved only approximately {{convert|2600|ft}} per pixel.&lt;ref name=Pyle2012-M9&gt;

[It] continues to orbit Mars to this day, sailing around the planet deaf and dumb in the cold darkness.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Achievements ==
[[File:M09 mtvs4187 45.gif|thumb|right|Mariner 9 view of the [[Noctis Labyrinthus]] "labyrinth" at the western end of [[Valles Marineris]].]]

Mariner 9 was the first [[spacecraft]] to [[orbit]] another [[planet]]. It carried an instrument payload similar to Mariners 6 and 7, but because of the need for a larger propulsion system to control the spacecraft in Martian orbit, it weighed more than Mariners 6 and 7 combined.&lt;ref name=Pyle2012-M9/&gt;

When Mariner 9 arrived at Mars on November 14, 1971, [[Planetary science|planetary scientists]] were surprised to find the [[celestial body's atmosphere|atmosphere]] was thick with "a planet-wide robe of [[Martian soil#Atmospheric dust|dust]], the largest [[Climate of mars#Dust storms on Mars|storm]] ever observed."  The surface was totally obscured. Mariner 9's computer was thus reprogrammed from Earth to delay imaging of the surface for a couple of months until the dust settled. The main surface imaging did not get underway until mid-January 1972.  However, surface-obscured images did contribute to the collection of Mars science, including understanding of the existence of several huge high-altitude volcanoes of the [[Tharsis Bulge]] that gradually became visible as the dust storm abated.  This unexpected situation made a strong case for the desirability of studying a planet from orbit rather than merely flying past.&lt;ref name=Pyle2012-M9/&gt; It also highlighted the importance of flexible mission software. The Soviet Union's [[Mars 2]] and [[Mars 3]] probes, which arrived during the same dust storm, were unable to adapt to the unexpected conditions, which severely limited the amount of data that they were able to collect.

After 349 days in orbit, Mariner 9 had transmitted 7,329 images, covering 85% of Mars' surface, whereas previous flyby missions had returned less than one thousand images covering only a small portion of the planetary surface.&lt;ref&gt;http://solarsystem.nasa.gov/missions/profile.cfm?Sort=Target&amp;Target=Mars&amp;MCode=Mariner_09&amp;Display=ReadMore 
&lt;/ref&gt; 
The images revealed [[river]] beds, [[Impact crater|crater]]s, massive extinct [[volcano]]es (such as [[Olympus Mons]], the largest known volcano in the [[Solar System]]; Mariner 9 led directly to its reclassification from Nix Olympica), [[canyon]]s (including the [[Valles Marineris]], a system of canyons over about {{convert|2500|mi|km|-1}} long), evidence of wind and water [[erosion]] and deposition, weather fronts, [[fog]]s, and more.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.space.com/18439-mariner-9.html&lt;/ref&gt; Mars' small [[natural satellite|moon]]s, [[Phobos (moon)|Phobos]] and [[Deimos (moon)|Deimos]], were also photographed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mars.jpl.nasa.gov/programmissions/missions/past/mariner89/ Mars Exploration Program: Mariner 8 &amp; 9&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hartmann, W. O. Raper.  1974.  The New Mars. The Discoveries of Mariner 9. With the Cooperation of the Mariner 9 Science Experiment Team. Prepared for the NASA Office of Space Science.&lt;/ref&gt;

The findings from the Mariner 9 mission underpinned the later [[Viking program]].&lt;ref name=Pyle2012-M9/&gt;

The enormous [[Valles Marineris]] canyon system is named after Mariner 9 in honor of its achievements.&lt;ref name=Pyle2012-M9/&gt;

After depleting its supply of [[attitude control]] gas, the spacecraft was turned off on October 27, 1972.&lt;ref name=Pyle2012-M9/&gt;

== Construction ==
[[File:Mariner8&amp;9 schematics.jpg|thumb|right|250px|A schematic of Mariner 9, showing the major components and features]]
The [[ultraviolet]] [[spectrometer]] aboard Mariner 9 was constructed by the [[Laboratory for Atmospheric and Space Physics]] at the [[University of Colorado at Boulder|University of Colorado]], [[Boulder, Colorado]]. The ultraviolet spectrometer team was led by Professor Charles Barth.

The Infrared Interferometer Spectrometer (IRIS) team was led by Dr. Rudolf A. Hanel from [[NASA Goddard Spaceflight Center]] (GSFC). The IRIS instrument was built by [[Texas Instruments]], [[Dallas, Texas]].

The Infrared Radiometer (IRR) team was led by Professor Gerald Neugebauer from the [[California Institute of Technology]] (Caltech).

== Error-Correction Codes achievements ==
To control for errors in the reception of the [[grayscale]] image data sent by Mariner 9 (caused by a low [[signal-to-noise ratio]]), the data had to be encoded before transmission using a so-called [[forward error correction|forward error-correcting code]] (FEC). Without FEC, noise would have made up roughly a quarter of a received image, while the FEC encoded the data in a redundant way which allowed for the reconstruction of most of the sent image data at reception.

Since the flown hardware was constrained with regards to weight, power consumption, storage, and computing power, some considerations had to be put into choosing an FEC, and it was decided to use a [[Hadamard code]] for Mariner 9. Each image pixel was represented as a six-bit binary value, which had 64 possible [[grayscale]] levels. Because of limitations of the transmitter, the maximum useful data length was about 30 bits. Instead of using a [[repetition code]], a [32, 6, 16] punctured Hadamard code was used, which is also a 1st-order [[Reed-Muller code]]. Errors of up to seven bits per each 32-bit word could be corrected using this scheme.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRv3HMEyuDE] 64 Shades of Martian Grey – Computerphile&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtOCqKpti7s] Reed-Muller Code (64 Shades of Grey pt2) – Computerphile&lt;/ref&gt; Compared to a five-repetition code, the error correcting properties of this Hadamard code were much better, yet its data rate was comparable. The efficient decoding [[algorithm]] was an important factor in the decision to use this code. The circuitry used was called the "Green Machine", which employed the [[fast Fourier transform]], increasing the decoding speed by a factor of three.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www-math.ucdenver.edu/~wcherowi/courses/m7409/mariner9talk.pdf] Combinatorics in Space The Mariner 9 Telemetry System&lt;/ref&gt;

== Present location ==
Mariner 9 remains a derelict satellite in Mars orbit.&lt;ref name=Pyle2012-M9/&gt;  It is expected to remain in orbit until approximately 2022, when the spacecraft is projected to enter the Martian atmosphere and either burn up or crash into the planet's surface.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nasa.gov/offices/oce/appel/ask-academy/issues/volume4/ata_4-9_mariner_9_prt.htm NASA – This Month in NASA History: Mariner 9], November 29, 2011 – Vol. 4, Issue 9 {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130514043808/http://www.nasa.gov/offices/oce/appel/ask-academy/issues/volume4/ata_4-9_mariner_9_prt.htm |date=May 14, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Marpi Reef''' or '''Marpi Bank''' is a narrow [[seamount]] lies {{convert|28|km|mi|abbr=on}} north of [[Saipan]]. With length of {{convert|9|km|mi|abbr=on}} and {{convert|4|km|mi|abbr=on}} in width, the reef is generally similar to the Tatsumi Reef south of [[Tinian]] in terms of orientation in a northeast to southwest. The peak of the seamount is at 26 [[fathoms]] or 53 m under water surfaces.

It is one of fishing points in the region, and various [[cetacean]]s (whales and dolphins) migrate and live in the waters including [[humpback whale]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[[National Marine Fisheries Service|NOAA]] Pacific Islands Fisheries Science Center. 2017.

'''Martian soil''' is the fine [[regolith]] found on the surface of [[Mars]]. Its properties can differ significantly from those of terrestrial [[soil]], including its toxicity due to the presence of [[perchlorate]]s. The term Martian soil typically refers to the finer fraction of regolith. On Earth, the term "soil" usually includes [[organic matter|organic]] content.&lt;ref name = CertiniUgolini2013&gt;{{cite journal |title=An updated, expanded, universal definition of soil |doi= 10.1016/j.geoderma.2012.07.008|date=2013 |last1=Certini |first1=Giacomo |last2=Ugolini |first2=Fiorenzo C. |journal=Geoderma |volume=192 |pages=378–379 |bibcode=2013Geode.192..378C }}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, planetary scientists adopt a functional definition of soil to distinguish it from rocks.&lt;ref name = Karunatillake2007&gt;{{cite journal|title=Chemical compositions at Mars landing sites subject to Mars Odyssey Gamma Ray Spectrometer constraints |doi=10.1029/2006JE002859|bibcode = 2007JGRE..112.8S90K |date=2007 |last1=Karunatillake |first1=Suniti |last2=Keller |first2=John M. |last3=Squyres |first3=Steven W. |last4=Boynton |first4=William V. |last5=Brückner |first5=Johannes |last6=Janes |first6=Daniel M. |last7=Gasnault |first7=Olivier |last8=Newsom |first8=Horton E. |journal=Journal of Geophysical Research |volume=112 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Rocks generally refer to 10&amp;nbsp;cm scale and larger materials (e.g., fragments, [[breccia]], and exposed outcrops) with high thermal inertia, with areal fractions consistent with the Viking Infrared Thermal Mapper (IRTM) data, and immobile under current aeolian conditions.&lt;ref name="Karunatillake2007"/&gt; Consequently, rocks classify as grains exceeding the size of cobbles on the [[Wentworth scale]].

This approach enables agreement across Martian remote sensing methods that span the electromagnetic spectrum from [[gamma ray|gamma]] to [[radio waves]]. ‘‘Soil’’ refers to all other, typically unconsolidated, material including those sufficiently fine-grained to be mobilized by wind.&lt;ref name="Karunatillake2007"/&gt; Soil consequently encompasses a variety of regolith components identified at landing sites. Typical examples include: bedform armor, clasts, concretions, drift, dust, rocky fragments, and sand. The functional definition reinforces a recently proposed genetic definition of soil on terrestrial bodies (including [[asteroid]]s and [[satellite]]s) as an unconsolidated and chemically weathered surficial layer of fine-grained mineral or organic material exceeding centimeter scale thickness, with or without coarse elements and cemented portions.&lt;ref name="CertiniUgolini2013"/&gt;

'''Martian dust''' generally connotes even finer materials than Martian soil, the fraction which is less than 30 micrometres in diameter. Disagreement over the significance of soil's definition arises due to the lack of an integrated concept of soil in the literature. The pragmatic definition "medium for plant growth" has been commonly adopted in the planetary science community but a more complex definition describes soil as "(bio)geochemically/physically altered material at the surface of a planetary body that encompasses surficial extraterrestrial telluric deposits." This definition emphasizes that soil is a body that retains information about its environmental history and that does not need the presence of life to form.


== Toxicity ==

Martian soil is toxic, due to relatively high concentrations of [[perchlorate]] compounds containing [[chlorine]]. Elemental chlorine was first discovered during localised investigations by [[Mars rover]] [[Sojourner (rover)|''Sojourner'']], and has been confirmed by [[Spirit (rover)|''Spirit'']], [[Opportunity (rover)|''Opportunity'']] and [[Curiosity (rover)|''Curiosity'']]. The ''[[Mars Odyssey]]'' orbiter has also detected [[perchlorate]]s across the surface of the planet.

The NASA [[Phoenix (spacecraft)|''Phoenix'' lander]] first detected chlorine-based compounds such as [[calcium perchlorate]]. The levels detected in the Martian soil are around 0.5%, which is a level considered toxic to humans.&lt;ref name="toxicmars"&gt;{{cite web |title=Toxic Mars: Astronauts Must Deal with Perchlorate on the Red Planet |url=https://www.space.com/21554-mars-toxic-perchlorate-chemicals.html |website=space.com |accessdate=26 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; These compounds are also toxic to plants. A 2013 terrestrial study found that a similar level of concentration to that found on Mars (0.5 g per litre) caused:
* a significant decline in the chlorophyll content in plant leaves,
* reduction in the oxidizing power of plant roots
* reduction in the size of the plant both above and below ground
* an accumulation of concentrated perchlorates in the leaves
The report noted that one of the types of plant studied seemed resistant to the perchlorates and could be used to help remove the toxins in its environment, although the plants themselves would end up containing a high concentration of perchlorates as a result.&lt;ref name="Effects of perchlorates on plants"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=He |first1=H |last2=Gao |first2=H |last3=Chen |first3=G |last4=Li |first4=H |last5=Lin |first5=H |last6=Shu |first6=Z |title=Effects of perchlorate on growth of four wetland plants and its accumulation in plant tissues |date=15 May 2013 |url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23673920 |accessdate=30 November 2018 |publisher=US National Library of Medicine National Institutes of Health |location=Key Laboratory of Tropical Agricultural Environment in South China}}&lt;/ref&gt;
There is evidence that some bacterial lifeforms are able to overcome perchlorates and even live off them. However the added effect of the high levels of UV reaching the surface of Mars breaks the molecular bonds, creating even more dangerous chemicals which in lab tests on Earth were shown to be more lethal to bacteria than the perchlorates alone. &lt;ref name="toxicsoil1"&gt;{{cite web |title=Mars covered in toxic chemicals that can wipe out living organisms, tests reveal |url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/2017/jul/06/mars-covered-in-toxic-chemicals-that-can-wipe-out-living-organisms-tests-reveal |website=The Guardian |accessdate=26 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Dust hazard ===

The potential danger to human health of the fine Martian dust has long been recognised by [[NASA]]. A 2002 study warned about the potential threat, and a study was carried out using the most common silicates found on Mars: [[olivine]], [[pyroxene]] and [[feldspar]]. It found that the dust reacted with small amounts of water to produce highly reactive molecules that are also produced during the mining of quartz and known to produce [[lung disease]] in miners on Earth, including cancer (the study also noted that [[Lunar dust]] may be worse).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Hecht |first1=Jeff |title=Martian dust may be hazardous to your health |journal=New Scientist |date=9 March 2007 |volume=225 |issue=Earth &amp; Planetary Sciences Letters |page=41 |url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn11357-martian-dust-may-be-hazardous-to-your-health/ |accessdate=30 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following on from this, since 2005 NASA's Mars Exploration Program Analysis Group (MEPAG) has had a goal to determine the possible toxic effects of the dust on humans. In 2010, the group noted that although the [[Phoenix (spacecraft)|''Phoenix'' lander]] and the rovers [[Spirit (rover)|''Spirit'']] and [[Opportunity (rover)|''Opportunity'']] had contributed to answering this question, none of the instruments have been suitable for measuring the particular [[carcinogen]]s that are of concern.&lt;ref name="MEPAG Toxic Dust"&gt;{{cite web |title=MEPAG Goal 5: Toxic Effects of Martian Dust on Humans |url=https://mepag.jpl.nasa.gov/goal.cfm?goal=5 |website=Mars Exploration Program Analysis Group |publisher=NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory |accessdate=30 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Mars 2020]] rover is an astrobiology mission that will also will make measurements to help designers of a future [[Human mission to Mars|human expedition]] understand any hazards posed by Martian dust. It employs the following related instruments:
* [[Mars Environmental Dynamics Analyzer|MEDA]], a set of atmospheric sensors that measure various things including radiation, and dust size and shape.
* [[Planetary Instrument for X-Ray Lithochemistry|PIXL]], an [[X-ray fluorescence]] [[spectrometer]] to determine the fine scale elemental composition of Martian surface materials.&lt;ref name="NASA-20140731PIXL"&gt;{{cite web |last=Webster |first=Guy |title=Mars 2020 Rover's PIXL to Focus X-Rays on Tiny Targets |url=http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.php?release=2014-253 |date=31 July 2014 |publisher=[[NASA]] |accessdate=31 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.davidraythompson.com/publications/Thompson_2014_iSAIRAS_PIXL.pdf |title=Adaptive sampling for rover x-ray lithochemistry |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140808034737/http://www.davidraythompson.com/publications/Thompson_2014_iSAIRAS_PIXL.pdf |archivedate=8 August 2014 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Scanning Habitable Environments with Raman and Luminescence for Organics and Chemicals|SHERLOC]], an ultraviolet [[Raman spectroscopy|Raman spectrometer]] that uses fine-scale imaging and an ultraviolet (UV) laser to determine fine-scale mineralogy&lt;ref name="NASA-20140731SHER"&gt;{{cite web |last=Webster |first=Guy |title=SHERLOC to Micro-Map Mars Minerals and Carbon Rings |url=http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.php?release=2014-254 |date=31 July 2014 |publisher=[[NASA]] |accessdate=31 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hou.usra.edu/meetings/georaman2014/pdf/5101.pdf |title=SHERLOC: Scanning Habitable Environments with Raman and Luminescence for Organics and Chemicals, an Investigation for 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This mission may also the first part of a [[Mars sample-return mission]], collecting samples which it will leave for a potential future mission that would gather the cached samples for their transport to Earth. Any questions about dust toxicity that have not already been answered ''in situ'', can then be tackled by labs on Earth.

Mars is covered with vast expanses of sand and dust and its surface is littered with rocks and boulders.  The dust is occasionally picked up in vast planet-wide [[dust storm]]s.  Mars dust is very fine, and enough remains suspended in the atmosphere to give the sky a reddish hue.  The reddish [[hue]] is due to rusting iron minerals presumably formed a few billion years ago when Mars was warm and wet, but now that Mars is cold and dry, modern rusting may be due to a superoxide that forms on minerals exposed to ultraviolet rays in sunlight.&lt;ref name = Yen2000&gt;{{cite journal|doi= 10.1126/science.289.5486.1909 |title= Evidence that the reactivity of the Martian soil is due to superoxide ions |date=2000|author= Yen, A.S., Kim, S.S., Hecht, M.H., Frant, M.S., Murray, B. |journal=Science|volume=289|pages=1909–12|pmid= 10988066|issue= 5486|bibcode = 2000Sci...289.1909Y |last2= Kim |last3= Hecht |last4= Frant |last5= Murray }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The sand is believed to move only slowly in the Martian winds due to the very low density of the atmosphere in the present epoch.  In the past, liquid water flowing in gullies and river valleys may have shaped the Martian regolith.  Mars researchers are studying whether [[groundwater sapping]] is shaping the Martian regolith in the present epoch, and whether [[carbon dioxide clathrate|carbon dioxide hydrates]] exist on Mars and play a role.

It is believed that large quantities of water and carbon dioxide{{citation needed|date=July 2013}} ices remain frozen within the regolith in the equatorial parts of Mars and on its surface at higher latitudes. According to the High Energy Neutron Detector of the [[Mars Odyssey]] satellite the water content of Martian regolith is up to 5% by weight.&lt;ref name = Mitrofanov2002&gt;{{cite journal|doi= 10.1126/science.1073616 |title= Mineralogy at Gusev crater from the Mössbauer spectrometer on the Spirit rover|date=2004|author= Mitrofanov, I. et 11 al.|journal=Science|volume=297|pages=78–81|pmid= 12040089|issue= 5578|bibcode = 2002Sci...297...78M |last2= Anfimov |last3= Kozyrev |last4= Litvak |last5= Sanin |last6= Tret'Yakov |last7= Krylov |last8= Shvetsov |last9= Boynton |last10= Shinohara |last11= Hamara |last12= Saunders }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = Horneck2008&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/j.actaastro.2007.12.002|title= The microbial case for Mars and its implications for human expeditions to Mars |date=2008|author= Horneck, G. |journal= Acta Astronautica|volume=63|pages=1015–1024|issue=7–10|bibcode=2008AcAau..63.1015H}}&lt;/ref&gt; The presence of [[olivine]], which is an easily weatherable primary mineral, has been interpreted to mean that physical rather than chemical weathering processes currently dominate on [[Mars]].&lt;ref name = Morris2004&gt;{{cite journal|doi= 10.1126/science.1100020 |title= Mineralogy at Gusev crater from the Mössbauer spectrometer on the Spirit rover|date=2004|author= Morris, R.V. et 16 al.|journal=Science|volume=305|pages=833–6|pmid= 15297666|issue= 5685|bibcode = 2004Sci...305..833M |last2= Klingelhöfer |last3= Bernhardt |last4= Schröder |last5= Rodionov |last6= De Souza |last7= Yen |last8= Gellert |last9= Evlanov |last10= Foh |last11= Kankeleit |last12= Gütlich |last13= Ming |last14= Renz |last15= Wdowiak |last16= Squyres |last17= Arvidson }}&lt;/ref&gt; High concentrations of ice in soils are thought to be the cause of accelerated [[Downslope creep|soil creep]], which forms the rounded "[[Terrain softening (Mars)|softened terrain]]" characteristic of the Martian midlatitudes.
 
In June, 2008, the [[Phoenix (lander)|''Phoenix'' lander]] returned data showing Martian soil to be slightly alkaline and containing vital nutrients such as [[magnesium]], [[sodium]], [[potassium]] and [[chloride]], all of which are necessary for living organisms to grow. Scientists compared the soil near Mars' north pole to that of backyard gardens on Earth, and concluded that it could be suitable for growth of plants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Martian soil 'could support life' | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/7477310.stm | publisher = BBC News|date=June 27, 2008 |accessdate=August 7, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in August, 2008, the Phoenix Lander conducted simple [[chemistry]] experiments, mixing water from Earth with Martian soil in an attempt to test its [[pH]], and discovered traces of the [[salt (chemistry)|salt]] [[perchlorate]], while also confirming many scientists' theories that the Martian surface was considerably [[Base (chemistry)|basic]], measuring at 8.3.

While our understanding of Martian soils is extremely rudimentary, their diversity may raise the question of how we might compare them with our Earth-based soils. Applying an Earth-based system is largely debatable but a simple option is to distinguish the (largely) biotic Earth from the [[abiotic]] Solar System, and include all non-Earth soils in a new [[World Reference Base for Soil Resources]] Reference Group or [[USDA soil taxonomy]] Order, which might be tentatively called Astrosols.&lt;ref name = Certini2009&gt;{{cite journal|doi= 10.1111/j.1365-2389.2009.01173.x |title= A view of extraterrestrial soils |date=2009|author= Certini, G, Scalenghe, R, Amundson, R |journal= European Journal of Soil Science|volume=60|pages=1078–1092|issue= 6|url=https://zenodo.org/record/848901}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 17, 2012 ([[Curiosity rover]] at "[[Rocknest (Mars)|Rocknest]]"), the first [[X-ray crystallography#Mineralogy and metallurgy|X-ray diffraction analysis]] of Martian soil was performed.  The results revealed the presence of several minerals, including [[feldspar]], [[pyroxenes]] and [[olivine]], and suggested that the Martian soil in the sample was similar to the "weathered [[Basalt|basaltic soils]]" of [[Hawaii Volcanoes|Hawaiian volcanoes]].&lt;ref name="NASA-20121030"&gt;{{cite web |last=Brown |first=Dwayne |title=NASA Rover's First Soil Studies Help Fingerprint Martian Minerals |url=http://www.nasa.gov/home/hqnews/2012/oct/HQ_12-383_Curiosity_CheMin.html |date=October 30, 2012 |publisher=[[NASA]] |accessdate=October 31, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hawaiian volcanic ash has been used as [[Martian regolith simulant]] by researchers since 1998.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Mojave Martian Simulant: A New Martian Soil Simulant|date=2007|publisher=Lunar and Planetary Science XXXVIII|url=http://www.lpi.usra.edu/meetings/lpsc2007/pdf/2005.pdf|author=L.

In December 2012, scientists working on the [[Mars Science Laboratory]] mission announced that an extensive [[soil analysis]] of Martian soil performed by the [[Curiosity rover]] showed evidence of [[Water on Mars|water molecules]], [[sulphur]] and [[chlorine]], as well as hints of [[organic compounds]].&lt;ref name="NASA-20121203" /&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT-20121203" /&gt;&lt;ref name="NZ-20121204"&gt;{{cite news |last=Satherley |first=Dan |title='Complex chemistry' found on Mars |url=http://www.3news.co.nz/Complex-chemistry-found-on-Mars/tabid/1160/articleID/279080/Default.aspx |work=[[3 News]] |date=December 4, 2012 |accessdate=December 4, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, [[Earth|terrestrial]] contamination, as the source of the organic compounds, could not be ruled out.

On September 26, 2013, NASA scientists reported the [[Mars]] [[Curiosity (rover)|''Curiosity'' rover]] detected "abundant, easily accessible" [[Water on Mars|water]] (1.5 to 3 weight percent) in soil samples at the [[Rocknest (Mars)|Rocknest region]] of [[Aeolis Palus]] in [[Gale Crater]].&lt;ref name="ST-20130926"&gt;{{cite web |last=Lieberman |first=Josh |title=Mars Water Found: Curiosity Rover Uncovers 'Abundant, Easily Accessible' Water In Martian Soil |url=http://www.isciencetimes.com/articles/6131/20130926/mars-water-soil-nasa-curiosity-rover-martian.htm |date=September 26, 2013 |work=iSciencetimes |accessdate=September 26, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Science-20130926a"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Leshin |first1=L.

Similarly sized '''dust''' will settle from the thinner Martian atmosphere sooner than it would on Earth. For example, the dust suspended by the 2001 global dust storms on Mars only remained in the Martian atmosphere for 0.6 years, while the dust from [[Mt. Pinatubo]] took about 2 years to settle.&lt;ref name = Cantor2001&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/j.icarus.2006.08.019|title=MOC observations of the 2001 Mars planet-encircling dust storm|date=2007|author=Cantor, B|journal=[[Icarus (journal)|Icarus]]|volume=186|pages=60–96|bibcode=2007Icar..186...60C}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, under current Martian conditions, the mass movements involved are generally much smaller than on Earth. Even the 2001 global dust storms on Mars moved only the equivalent of a very thin dust layer – about 3&amp;nbsp;µm thick if deposited with uniform thickness between 58° north and south of the equator.&lt;ref name = Cantor2001/&gt; Dust deposition at the [[Mars Exploration Rover|two rover sites]] has proceeded at a rate of about the thickness of a grain every 100 [[Timekeeping on Mars|sols]].&lt;ref name="Claudin2006"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/j.epsl.2006.09.004|title=A scaling law for aeolian dunes on Mars, Venus, Earth, and for subaqueous ripples|date=2006|author=Claudin, P|journal=[[Earth and Planetary Science Letters]]|volume=252|pages=30–44|last2=Andreotti|first2=B|bibcode=2006E&amp;PSL.252...30C|arxiv = cond-mat/0603656 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The difference in the concentration of dust in Earth's atmosphere and that of Mars stems from a key factor. On Earth, dust that leaves atmospheric suspension usually gets aggregated into larger particles through the action of soil moisture or gets suspended in oceanic waters. It helps that most of earth's surface is covered by liquid water. Neither process occurs on Mars, leaving deposited dust available for suspension back into the Martian atmosphere.&lt;ref name = Sullivan2008&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1029/2008JE003101|title=Wind-driven particle mobility on Mars: Insights from Mars Exploration Rover observations at "El Dorado" and surroundings at Gusev Crater|date=2008|author=Sullivan, R.|journal=[[Journal of Geophysical Research]]|volume=113|pages=E06S07|last2=Arvidson|first2=R.|last3=Bell|first3=J.

Furthermore, wind activity dominates the surface of Mars at present, and the abundant dune fields of Mars can easily yield particles into atmospheric suspension through effects such as larger grains disaggregating fine particles through collisions.&lt;ref name = Edgett2002&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1029/2001JE001587|title=Low-albedo surfaces and eolian sediment: Mars Orbiter Camera views of western Arabia Terra craters and wind streaks|date=2002|author=Edgett, Kenneth S.|journal=Journal of Geophysical Research|volume=107|pages=5038|bibcode=2002JGRE..107.5038E}}&lt;/ref&gt;
  
The Martian atmospheric dust particles are generally 3&amp;nbsp;µm in diameter.&lt;ref name = Lemmon2004&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1126/science.1104474|date=Dec 2004|author=Lemmon, Mt; Wolff, Mj; Smith, Md; Clancy, Rt; Banfield, D; Landis, Ga; Ghosh, A; Smith, Ph; Spanovich, N; Whitney, B; Whelley, P; Greeley, R; Thompson, S; Bell, Jf, 3Rd; Squyres, Sw|title=Atmospheric imaging results from the Mars exploration rovers: Spirit and Opportunity|volume=306|issue=5702|pages=1753–6|issn=0036-8075|pmid=15576613|journal=Science|bibcode = 2004Sci...306.1753L |last2=Wolff|last3=Smith|last4=Clancy|last5=Banfield|last6=Landis|last7=Ghosh|last8=Smith|last9=Spanovich|last10=Whitney|last11=Whelley|last12=Greeley|last13=Thompson|last14=Bell|last15=Squyres}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is important to note that while the atmosphere of Mars is thinner, Mars also has a lower gravitational acceleration, so the size of particles that will remain in suspension cannot be estimated with atmospheric thickness alone. Electrostatic and [[van der Waals forces]] acting among fine particles introduce additional complexities to calculations. Rigorous modeling of all relevant variables suggests that 3&amp;nbsp;µm diameter particles can remain in suspension indefinitely at most wind speeds, while particles as large as 20&amp;nbsp;µm diameter can enter suspension from rest at surface wind turbulence as low as 2 ms&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; or remain in suspension at 0.8 ms&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref name="Claudin2006"/&gt;

==Research on Earth==

[[File:Martian regolith simulant - pile.JPG|thumb|A small pile of JSC MARS-1A soil simulant&lt;ref name=orbitec&gt;{{cite web|title=Lunar &amp; Mars Soil Simulant|url=http://www.orbitec.com/store/simulant.html|publisher=Orbitec|accessdate=27 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Research on [[Earth]] is currently limited to using [[Martian soil simulant]]s, which are based on the analysis from the various [[Mars]] [[spacecraft]]. These are a terrestrial material that is used to simulate the chemical and mechanical properties of [[Mars|Martian]] [[regolith]] for research, experiments and [[prototype]] testing of activities related to [[Martian soil]] such as dust mitigation of transportation equipment, advanced [[life support system]]s and [[in-situ resource utilization]].

A number of [[Mars sample return]] missions are being planned, which would allow actual [[Martian soil]] to be returned to [[Earth]] for more advanced analysis than is possible in situ on the surface of [[Mars]]. This should allow even more accurate simulants. The first of these missions is a multi-part mission beginning with the [[Mars 2020]] lander. This will collect samples over a long period. A second lander will then gather the samples and return them to [[Earth]].

It operated for thirty-one years, from 1974 until 2005. The name of the organization evokes the political task that feminists must "move the mountains" of institutional [[sexism]] and [[homophobia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Duke-Whitaker |first=Lois |authorlink= |title=Women in Politics: Outsiders or Insiders?: A Collection of Readings |url= |year=1999 |publisher=[[Prentice Hall]] |location=[[Upper Saddle River, New Jersey]] |isbn=013096610X |page=380 |pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[alternative political spelling|alternative spelling]] of "[[womyn]]" represented an expression of female independence and a repudiation of traditions that define women by reference to [[male as norm|a male norm]].&lt;ref name="neeru"&gt;Neeru Tandon (2008).

The [[womyn-born womyn]] policy generated some controversy during the 1980s when pressure was put on the coffeehouse to allow admittance to men, as well as in the 1990s when the policy was contested by transgender women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mountain Moving Memories|url=http://www.windycitymediagroup.com/lgbt/Mountain-Moving-Memories/9599.html|work=[[Windy City Times]]|date=September 28, 2005|accessdate=8 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was claimed that the policy was [[Transphobia|discriminatory]] and created "mental difficulties" for transgender women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Boston Women's Health Book Collective |authorlink1= |last2= |first2= |authorlink2= |editor1-first= |editor1-last= |editor1-link= |title=Our Bodies, Ourselves: A New Edition for a New Era |trans-title=|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xlx94hWpe6YC&amp;pg=PA153&amp;lpg=PA153&amp;dq=%22Mountain+Moving+Coffeehouse%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=yHIoUNlnbh&amp;sig=Z1Hh7UjSvYX3dJfVMJyaR6KkzBE&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=3JjVULjAA-yP0QHXm4HQAQ&amp;ved=0CDIQ6AEwATgU#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |format= |accessdate= |type= |edition=35th anniversary |series= |volume= |date= |year=2005 |origyear=1971 |publisher=[[Simon &amp; Schuster]] |location=New York City |isbn=0743256115 |oclc=57283896 |doi= |id= |page=153 |pages= |at= |trans-chapter=|chapter= |chapterurl= |quote= |ref= |bibcode= |laysummary= |laydate= |author-mask= |display-authors= |postscript= |lastauthoramp=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The policy was also challenged in the 1990s by a local gay male journalist.

Upon the closure of the coffeehouse on December 10, 2005, it was the oldest continuously operating womyn-born womyn and girl-only concert venue in the United States. A successor organization was created called the Kindred Hearts' Coffeehouse, which serves as a monthly event offering women's music.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.windycitymediagroup.com/lgbt/Mountain-Moving-Tradition-Lives-On/11346.html |title=

==History==
{{main|History of Islam|Timeline of Islamic history}}
[[File:TabulaRogeriana upside-down.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|The [[Tabula Rogeriana]], drawn by [[Al-Idrisi]] in 1154, one of the most advanced [[ancient world maps]]. Al-Idrisi also wrote about the diverse Muslim communities found in various lands.]]

[[History of Islam|Muslim history]] involves the history of the Islamic faith as a religion and as a social institution. The history of Islam began in the [[Arabian Peninsula]] when the [[Prophets of Islam|Islamic prophet]] [[Muhammad]] received the first revelation of the [[Quran]] in the 7th century in the [[cave of Hira]] in the month of [[Ramadan]]. According to tradition, he was supposedly commanded by [[Allah]] to convey this message to the people, and to be patient with those hostile to it. These included the leaders of the [[Quraysh]], the ruling tribe of Mecca, who opposed the assertion of [[tawhid]] ([[monotheism]]) and abolishing what Muhammed branded "[[idolatry]]", meaning the worship of gods other than Allah at the [[Kaaba]], such as [[Hubal]] and the goddesses [[al-Lat|al-Lāt]], [[Al-‘Uzzá]] and [[Manāt]]. After 13 years of spreading this message, despite increased persecution by the Quraysh, Muhammad and his followers migrated to [[Medina]] to [[Constitution of Medina|establish a new state]] under the prophet's leadership and away from persecution. This migration, called the [[Hegira|Hijra]], marks the first year of the [[Islamic calendar]]. Islam was then spread to other parts of the Arabian Peninsula over the course of Muhammad's life.

After Muhammad died in 632, his successors (the [[Caliphs]]) continued to lead the Muslim community based on his teachings and guidelines of the Quran. The majority of Muslims consider the first four successors to be 'rightly guided' or [[Rashidun]]. The [[Rashidun Caliphate]]'s [[Muslim conquests|conquests]] [[Spread of Islam|spread Islam]] beyond the Arabian Peninsula, stretching from northwest [[India]], across [[Central Asia]], the [[Near East]], [[North Africa]], southern [[Italy]], and the [[Iberian Peninsula]], to the [[Pyrenees]]. The Arab Muslims were [[Arab–Byzantine wars|unable to conquer]] the entire Christian [[Byzantine Empire]] in [[Asia Minor]], however. The succeeding [[Umayyad Caliphate]] attempted two failed sieges of [[Constantinople]] in [[Siege of Constantinople (674–678)|674–678]] and [[Siege of Constantinople (717–718)|717–718]]. Meanwhile, the Muslim community tore itself apart into the rivalling [[Sunni Islam|Sunni]] and [[Shia Islam|Shia sects]] since the [[Siege of Uthman|killing of caliph Uthman]] in 656, resulting in a [[Succession to Muhammad|succession crisis]] that has never been resolved.&lt;ref&gt;Encarta-encyclopedie Winkler Prins (1993–2002) s.v. "islam. §7. Sektevorming". Microsoft Corporation/Het Spectrum.&lt;/ref&gt; The following [[First Fitna|First]], [[Second Fitna|Second]] and [[Third Fitna]]s and finally the [[Abbasid Revolution]] (746–750) also definitively destroyed the political unity of the Muslims, who have been inhabiting multiple states ever since.&lt;ref&gt;Encarta-encyclopedie Winkler Prins (1993–2002) s.v. "Omajjaden §1. De Spaanse tak". Microsoft Corporation/Het Spectrum.&lt;/ref&gt;

Subsequent empires dominated by Muslims, such as those of the [[Abbasids]], [[Fatimids]], [[Almoravids]], [[Seljukids]], [[Ayyubids]], [[Ajuran Sultanate|Ajuran]], [[Adal Sultanate|Adal]] and [[Warsangali Empire|Warsangali]] in [[Somalia]], [[Mughal Empire|Mughals]] in the Indian subcontinent ([[India]], [[Bangladesh]], [[Afghanistan]] e.t.c), [[Timurids]] and [[Safavid]]s in [[Persia]] and [[Ottoman empire|Ottomans]] in [[Anatolia]], were among the influential and distinguished powers in the world. 19th-century colonialism and 20th-century decolonisation have resulted in several independent Muslim-majority states around the world, with vastly differing attitudes towards and political influences granted to, or restricted for, Islam from country to country. These have revolved around the question of Islam's compatibility with other ideological concepts such as [[Islam and secularism|secularism]], [[nationalism]] (especially [[Arab nationalism]] and [[Pan-Arabism]], as opposed to [[Pan-Islamism]]), [[Islamic socialism|socialism]] (see also [[Arab socialism]] and [[socialism in Iran]]), [[democracy]] (see [[Islamic democracy]]), [[republicanism]] (see also [[Islamic republic]]), [[liberalism and progressivism within Islam|liberalism and progressivism]], [[Islamic feminism|feminism]], [[capitalism and Islam|capitalism]] and more.

The best known work of fiction from the Islamic world is ''[[One Thousand and One Nights]]'' (In Persian: ''hezār-o-yek šab'' &gt; Arabic: ''ʔalf-layl-at-wa-l’-layla''= One thousand Night and (one) Night) or *''[[Arabian Nights]]'', a name invented by early Western translators, which is a compilation of [[Folklore|folk tales]] from [[Sanskrit]], Persian, and later Arabian [[fable]]s. The original concept is derived from a pre-Islamic Persian prototype '''''Hezār Afsān''''' (Thousand Fables) that relied on particular [[Sanskrit literature|Indian elements]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | last = Marzolph | encyclopedia = Encyclopaedia of Islam | title = Arabian Nights | year = 2007 | publisher = Brill | volume = I | location = Leiden }}&lt;/ref&gt; It reached its final form by the 14th century; the number and type of tales have varied from one manuscript to another.&lt;ref name="arabianNights"&gt;Grant &amp; Clute, p. 51&lt;/ref&gt; All Arabian [[fantasy]] tales tend to be called ''Arabian Nights'' stories when translated into English, regardless of whether they appear in ''[[The Book of One Thousand and One Nights]]'' or not.&lt;ref name="arabianNights"/&gt; This work has been very influential in the West since it was translated in the 18th century, first by [[Antoine Galland]].&lt;ref&gt;[[L. Sprague de Camp]], ''[[Literary Swordsmen and Sorcerers]]: The Makers of Heroic Fantasy'', p. 10 {{ISBN|0-87054-076-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Imitations were written, especially in France.&lt;ref name="arabianNights2"&gt;Grant &amp; Clute, p 52&lt;/ref&gt; Various characters from this epic have themselves become [[cultural icon]]s in [[Western culture]], such as [[Aladdin]], [[Sinbad the Sailor]] and [[Ali Baba]].

A famous example of [[Arabic poetry]] and [[Persian literature|Persian poetry]] on [[romance (love)]] is ''[[Layla and Majnun]]'', dating back to the Umayyad era in the 7th century. It is a [[Tragedy|tragic]] story of undying love. [[Ferdowsi]]'s ''[[Shahnameh]]'', the national epic of [[Iran]], is a mythical and heroic retelling of [[History of Iran|Persian history]]. ''[[Amir Arsalan]]'' was also a popular mythical Persian story, which has influenced some modern works of fantasy fiction, such as ''[[The Heroic Legend of Arslan]]''.

[[Ibn Tufail]] (Abubacer) and [[Ibn al-Nafis]] were pioneers of the [[Philosophical fiction|philosophical novel]]. Ibn Tufail wrote the first Arabic novel ''[[Hayy ibn Yaqdhan]]'' (''[[Philosophus Autodidactus]]'') as a response to [[Al-Ghazali]]'s ''[[The Incoherence of the Philosophers]]'', and then Ibn al-Nafis also wrote a novel ''[[Ibn al-Nafis#Theologus Autodidactus|Theologus Autodidactus]]'' as a response to Ibn Tufail's ''Philosophus Autodidactus''. Both of these narratives had [[protagonist]]s (Hayy in ''Philosophus Autodidactus'' and Kamil in ''[[Theologus Autodidactus]]'') who were [[Autodidacticism|autodidactic]] [[feral child]]ren living in seclusion on a [[desert island]], both being the earliest examples of a desert island story. However, while Hayy lives alone with animals on the desert island for the rest of the story in ''Philosophus Autodidactus'', the story of Kamil extends beyond the desert island setting in ''Theologus Autodidactus'', developing into the earliest known [[coming of age]] plot and eventually becoming the first example of a science fiction novel.&lt;ref&gt;Dr. Abu Shadi Al-Roubi (1982), "Ibn Al-Nafis as a philosopher", ''Symposium on Ibn al-Nafis'', Second International Conference on Islamic Medicine: Islamic Medical Organization, Kuwait ([[cf.]] [http://www.islamset.com/isc/nafis/drroubi.html Ibn al-Nafis As a Philosopher] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080206072116/http://www.islamset.com/isc/nafis/drroubi.html |date=6 February 2008 }}, ''Encyclopedia of Islamic World'').&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nahyan A.

Rather than giving supernatural or mythological explanations for these events, Ibn al-Nafis attempted to explain these plot elements using the [[Science in the medieval Islamic world|scientific knowledge]] of [[Medicine in the medieval Islamic world|biology]], [[Astronomy in medieval Islam|astronomy]], [[Cosmology in medieval Islam|cosmology]] and [[Geography and cartography in medieval Islam|geology]] known in his time.

[[File:BAE09705.jpg|thumb|[[Averroes|Ibn Rushd (Averroes)]] [[Muslim]] [[polymath]] from [[Spain]].]]

One of the common definitions for "Islamic philosophy" is "the style of philosophy produced within the framework of [[Islamic culture]]."&lt;ref name="RoutledgeEoP"&gt;[http://www.rep.routledge.com/article/H057 "Islamic Philosophy"]  {{webarchive|url=https://www.webcitation.org/6YFDTux7u?url=https://www.rep.routledge.com/articles/islamic-philosophy;jsessionid=B31B033F077DD5E68E09CC9D35C02105 |date=3 May 2015 }}, ''Routledge Encyclopedia of Philosophy'' (1998)&lt;/ref&gt; Islamic philosophy, in this definition is neither necessarily concerned with religious issues, nor is exclusively produced by Muslims.&lt;ref name="RoutledgeEoP"/&gt; The [[Iranian peoples|Persian]] scholar [[Avicenna|Ibn Sina]] (Avicenna) (980–1037) had more than 450 books attributed to him. His writings were concerned with various subjects, most notably philosophy and medicine. His medical textbook ''[[The Canon of Medicine]]'' was used as the standard text in European universities for centuries. He also wrote ''[[The Book of Healing]]'', an influential scientific and philosophical encyclopedia.

One of the most influential Muslim philosophers in the West was Averroes (Ibn Rushd), founder of the [[Averroism]] school of philosophy, whose works and commentaries affected the rise of [[secularism|secular thought]] in Europe.&lt;ref name=Fakhry&gt;Majid Fakhry (2001). ''Averroes: His Life, Works and Influence''. Oneworld Publications. {{ISBN|1-85168-269-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt; He also developed the concept of "[[existence precedes essence]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|first=Jones|last=Irwin|title=Averroes' Reason: A Medieval Tale of Christianity and Islam|date=Autumn 2002|journal=The Philosopher|volume=LXXXX|issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another figure from the [[Islamic Golden Age]], Avicenna, also founded his own Avicennism school of philosophy, which was influential in both Islamic and Christian lands. He was also a critic of [[Organon|Aristotelian logic]] and founder of Avicennian logic, developed the concepts of [[empiricism]] and [[tabula rasa]], and distinguished between [[essence]] and [[existence]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}

Yet another influential philosopher who had an influence on [[modern philosophy]] was [[Ibn Tufail]]. His philosophical novel, ''[[Hayy ibn Yaqdha]]'', translated into Latin as ''Philosophus Autodidactus'' in 1671, developed the themes of empiricism, tabula rasa, [[nature versus nurture]],&lt;ref&gt;Russell (1994), pp. 224–62,&lt;/ref&gt; [[condition of possibility]], [[materialism]],&lt;ref&gt;Dominique Urvoy, "The Rationality of Everyday Life: The Andalusian Tradition?

Islamic philosophers continued making advances in philosophy through to the 17th century, when [[Mulla Sadra]] founded his school of [[Transcendent theosophy]] and developed the concept of [[existentialism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Mulla Sadra's Transcendent Philosophy|first=Muhammad|last=Kamal|year=2006|publisher=Ashgate Publishing, Ltd.|isbn=978-0-7546-5271-7|pages=9, 39|oclc=224496901}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other influential Muslim philosophers include [[al-Jahiz]], a pioneer in [[evolution]]ary thought; [[Alhazen|Ibn al-Haytham]] (Alhazen), a pioneer of [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]] and the [[philosophy of science]] and a critic of [[Aristotelian physics|Aristotelian natural philosophy]] and Aristotle's concept of [[Location (geography)|place]] (topos); [[Al-Biruni]], a critic of Aristotelian natural philosophy; Ibn Tufail and Ibn al-Nafis, pioneers of the philosophical novel; [[Shahab al-Din Suhrawardi]], founder of [[Illuminationism|Illuminationist philosophy]]; [[Fakhr al-Din al-Razi]], a critic of Aristotelian logic and a pioneer of [[Inductive reasoning|inductive logic]]; and [[Ibn Khaldun]], a pioneer in the [[philosophy of history]].&lt;ref name=Akhtar&gt;Dr. S.R.W.

Muslim scientists contributed to advances in the sciences. They placed far greater emphasis on experiment than had the [[Greeks]]. This led to an early [[scientific method]] being developed in the Muslim world, where progress in methodology was made, beginning with the experiments of Ibn al-Haytham (Alhazen) on [[optics]] from ''circa'' 1000, in his ''[[Book of Optics]]''. The most important development of the scientific method was the use of experiments to distinguish between competing scientific theories set within a generally empirical orientation, which began among [[List of Muslim scientists|Muslim scientists]]. Ibn al-Haytham is also regarded as the father of optics, especially for his empirical proof of the [[Visual perception#Early studies|intromission theory]] of light. Some have also described Ibn al-Haytham as the "first scientist."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Al-Khalili |first=Jim |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/7810846.stm |title=BBC News |publisher=BBC News |date=4 January 2009 |accessdate=11 April 2014 |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6YFBZo7A9?url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/7810846.stm# |archive-date=3 May 2015 |dead-url=no |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[al-Khwarzimi]]'s invented the log base systems that are being used today, he also contributed theorems in trigonometry as well as limits.&lt;ref&gt;Plofker, Kim (2009), Mathematics in India: 500 BCE–1800 CE, Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press. p. 384., {{ISBN|0-691-12067-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Recent studies show that it is very likely that the Medieval Muslim artists were aware of advanced [[decagon]]al [[quasicrystal]] geometry (discovered half a millennium later in the 1970s and 1980s in the West) and used it in intricate decorative tilework in the architecture.&lt;ref&gt;Peter J. Lu, [http://www.news.harvard.edu/gazette/2007/03.01/99-tiles.html Harvard's Office of News and Public Affairs] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070314012002/http://www.news.harvard.edu/gazette/2007/03.01/99-tiles.html |date=14 March 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Muslim physicians contributed to the field of medicine, including the subjects of [[anatomy]] and [[physiology]]: such as in the 15th-century Persian work by [[Mansur ibn Ilyas|Mansur ibn Muhammad ibn al-Faqih Ilyas]] entitled ''Tashrih al-badan'' (''Anatomy of the body'') which contained comprehensive diagrams of the body's structural, [[Nervous system|nervous]] and [[circulatory system]]s; or in the work of the Egyptian physician Ibn al-Nafis, who proposed the theory of [[pulmonary circulation]]. Avicenna's ''The Canon of Medicine'' remained an authoritative medical textbook in Europe until the 18th century. [[Abu al-Qasim al-Zahrawi]] (also known as ''Abulcasis'') contributed to the discipline of medical surgery with his ''[[Al-Tasrif|Kitab al-Tasrif]]'' ("Book of Concessions"), a medical encyclopedia which was later translated to Latin and used in European and Muslim medical schools for centuries. Other medical advancements came in the fields of [[pharmacology]] and [[pharmacy]].&lt;ref&gt;Turner, H. (1997) pp. 136–38&lt;/ref&gt;

In astronomy, [[Muḥammad ibn Jābir al-Ḥarrānī al-Battānī]] improved the precision of the measurement of the [[precession]] of the [[Axial tilt|Earth's axis]]. The corrections made to the [[geocentric model]] by al-Battani, Averroes, [[Nasir al-Din al-Tusi]], [[Mu'ayyad al-Din al-'Urdi]] and [[Ibn al-Shatir]] were later incorporated into the [[Copernican heliocentrism|Copernican heliocentric]] model. [[Heliocentrism|Heliocentric]] theories were also discussed by several other [[List of Muslim astronomers|Muslim astronomers]] such as Al-Biruni, [[Al-Sijzi]], [[Qotb al-Din Shirazi]], and [[Najm al-Dīn al-Qazwīnī al-Kātibī]]. The [[astrolabe]], though originally developed by the Greeks, was perfected by Islamic astronomers and engineers, and was subsequently brought to Europe.

Some most famous scientists from the medieval Islamic world include [[Jābir ibn Hayyān]], [[al-Farabi]], [[Abu al-Qasim al-Zahrawi]], [[Ibn al-Haytham]], [[Al-Biruni]], [[Avicenna]], [[Nasir al-Din al-Tusi]], and [[Ibn Khaldun]].

In technology, the Muslim world adopted [[papermaking]] from China.&lt;ref name=Lucas/&gt; The knowledge of [[gunpowder]] was also transmitted from China via predominantly Islamic countries,&lt;ref&gt;Arming the Periphery. Emrys Chew, 2012. p. 1823.&lt;/ref&gt; where formulas for pure [[potassium nitrate]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Ahmad Y. al-Hassan]], [http://www.history-science-technology.com/Articles/articles%202.htm Potassium Nitrate in Arabic and Latin Sources] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080226105129/http://www.history-science-technology.com/Articles/articles%202.htm |date=26 February 2008 }}, ''History of Science and Technology in Islam''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Gunpowder&gt;[[Ahmad Y. al-Hassan]], [http://www.history-science-technology.com/Articles/articles%203.htm Gunpowder Composition for Rockets and Cannon in Arabic Military Treatises In Thirteenth and Fourteenth Centuries] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080226104140/http://www.history-science-technology.com/Articles/articles%203.htm |date=26 February 2008 }}, ''History of Science and Technology in Islam''.&lt;/ref&gt; were developed.

Advances were made in [[irrigation]] and farming, using new technology such as the [[windmill]]. Crops such as [[almond]]s and [[citrus]] fruit were brought to Europe through [[al-Andalus]], and sugar cultivation was gradually adopted by the Europeans. Arab merchants dominated trade in the Indian Ocean until the arrival of the Portuguese in the 16th century. [[Ormus|Hormuz]] was an important center for this trade. There was also a dense network of [[trade route]]s in the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]], along which Muslim-majority countries traded with each other and with European powers such as [[Venice]], [[Genoa]] and [[Catalonia]]. The [[Silk Road]] crossing Central Asia passed through Muslim states between China and Europe.

Muslim engineers in the Islamic world made a number of innovative industrial uses of [[hydropower]], and early industrial uses of [[tidal power]] and [[wind power]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Ahmad Y. al-Hassan]] (1976). ''Taqi al-Din and Arabic Mechanical Engineering'', pp. 34–35.

A variety of industrial mills were being employed in the Islamic world, including early [[fulling]] mills, [[gristmill]]s, [[Rice huller|hullers]], [[sawmill]]s, [[ship mill]]s, [[stamp mill]]s, [[steel mill]]s, [[Sugar refinery|sugar mills]], [[tide mill]]s and windmills. By the 11th century, every province throughout the Islamic world had these industrial mills in operation, from al-Andalus and North Africa to the Middle East and Central Asia.&lt;ref name=Lucas&gt;Adam Robert Lucas (2005), "Industrial Milling in the Ancient and Medieval Worlds: A Survey of the Evidence for an Industrial Revolution in Medieval Europe", ''Technology and Culture'' '''46''' (1), pp. 1–30 [10].&lt;/ref&gt; Muslim engineers also invented [[crankshaft]]s and [[water turbine]]s, employed [[gear]]s in mills and water-raising machines, and pioneered the use of dams as a source of water power, used to provide additional power to watermills and water-raising machines.&lt;ref name=Hassan&gt;[[Ahmad Y. al-Hassan]], [http://www.history-science-technology.com/Articles/articles%2071.htm Transfer Of Islamic Technology To The West, Part II: Transmission Of Islamic Engineering] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080218171021/http://www.history-science-technology.com/Articles/articles%2071.htm |date=18 February 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Such advances made it possible for industrial tasks that were previously driven by [[manual labour]] in [[Ancient history|ancient times]] to be [[Mechanization|mechanized]] and driven by machinery instead in the medieval Islamic world. The transfer of these technologies to medieval Europe had an influence on the [[Industrial Revolution]].&lt;ref&gt;Adam Robert Lucas (2005), "Industrial Milling in the Ancient and Medieval Worlds: A Survey of the Evidence for an Industrial Revolution in Medieval Europe", ''Technology and Culture'' '''46''' (1), pp. 1–30.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gunpowder Empires===

Scholars often use the term [[Gunpowder Empires]] to describe the Islamic empires of the [[Safavid Empire|Safavid]], [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] and [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]].  Each of these three empires had considerable military exploits using the newly developed [[firearms]], especially [[cannon]] and small arms, to create their empires.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://novaonline.nvcc.edu/eli/evans/his112/Notes/Gunpowder.html |title=The Gunpowder Empires |first=Charles T |last=Evans |publisher=Northern Virginia Community College |accessdate=28 December 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110526092248/http://novaonline.nvcc.edu/eli/evans/his112/Notes/Gunpowder.html# |archive-date=26 May 2011 |dead-url=no |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; They existed primarily between the fourteenth and the late seventeenth centuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://wps.ablongman.com/long_brummett_cpp_11/35/9191/2353138.cw/index.html |title=The Islamic Gunpowder Empires, 1300–1650 |website=Civilization Past &amp; Present |publisher=Pearson Education |accessdate=28 December 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724011854/http://wps.ablongman.com/long_brummett_cpp_11/35/9191/2353138.cw/index.html |archivedate=24 July 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Great Divergence was the reason why European colonial powers militarily defeated preexisting Oriental powers like the [[Mughal Empire]], [[Ottoman Empire]] and many smaller states in the pre-modern [[Greater Middle East]], and initiated a period known as '[[colonialism]]'.&lt;ref name="6KillerApps"/&gt;

====Colonialism====
{{main|Colonial empire|Colonialism}}
[[File:World 1914 empires colonies territory.PNG|thumb|left|Map of colonial powers throughout the world in the year 1914 (note colonial powers in the pre-modern Muslim world).]]

Beginning with the 15th century, [[colonialism]] by European powers (particularly, but not exclusively, [[England|Britain]], [[Spain]], [[Portugal]], [[France]], the [[Netherlands]], [[Italy]], [[Germany]], [[Russia]], [[Austria]], and [[Belgium]]) profoundly affected Muslim-majority societies in [[Africa]], [[Europe]], the [[Middle East]] and [[Asia]]. Colonialism was often advanced by conflict with mercantile initiatives by colonial powers and caused tremendous social upheavals in Muslim-dominated societies.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}

A number of Muslim-majority societies reacted to Western powers with zealotry and thus initiating the rise of [[Pan-Islamism]]; or affirmed more traditionalist and inclusive cultural ideals; and in rare cases adopted modernity that was ushered by the colonial powers.&lt;ref name="ColonialismLegacies"&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Levy|editor1-first=Jacob T.|title=Colonialism and Its Legacies|date=2011|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield Publishers Group|location=Lanham|others=(Contributors: Alfred T, Chakabarty D, Dussel E, Eze E, Hsueh V, Kohn M, Bhanu Mehta P, Muthu S, Parekh B, Pitts J, Schutte O, Souza J, Young IM) |isbn=9780739142943}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The only Muslim-majority regions not to be colonized by the Europeans were Saudi Arabia, Iran, Turkey, and Afghanistan.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}} Turkey was one of the first colonial powers of the world with the Ottoman empire ruling several states for over 6 centuries.&lt;!---This unsourced claim is questionable in many aspects. Could we describe the brief occupation of Syria, Lebanon, Iraq, etc. by Britain and France as 'colonial'? They were League of Nations mandate territories that were gradually granted autonomy and independence within 40 years. Moreover, shouldn't we classify the pre-European centuries-long occupation of these regions by the Ottoman Empire as 'colonial', too? In fact, that would be more justified than in the Franco-British period. And what to think of Uyghuria and other Central Asian Muslim-majority areas that were conquered/occupied in the 19th and early 20th century by power such as Tsarist Russia and Qing China?---&gt;

The two main denominations of Islam are the [[Shia-Sunni relations|Sunni and Shia]] sects. They differ primarily upon of how the life of the ummah ("faithful") should be governed, and the role of the [[imam]]. Sunnis believe that the true political successor of the Prophet according to the Sunnah should be selected based on ٍ[[Shura]] (consultation), as was done at [[Saqifah|the Saqifah]] which selected [[Abu Bakr]], Muhammad's father-in-law, to be Muhammad's political but not his religious successor. Shia, on the other hand, believe that Muhammad designated his son-in-law [[Ali ibn Abi Talib]] as his true political as well as religious successor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.religionfacts.com/islam/comparison_charts/islamic_sects.htm |title=Comparison Chart of Sunni and Shia Islam |publisher=ReligionFacts |date= |accessdate=24 October 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110429101140/http://www.religionfacts.com/islam/comparison_charts/islamic_sects.htm# |archive-date=29 April 2011 |dead-url=no |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Islamic schools and branches ====
[[File:Madhhab Map2a.png|thumb|upright=1.35|The main Islamic [[madh'hab]]s (schools of law) of Muslim-majority countries or distributions]]
{{main|Islamic schools and branches}}

The first centuries of Islam gave rise to three major [[Muslim sects|sects]]: [[Sunni]]s, [[Shi'a]]s and [[Kharijites]]. Each sect developed distinct [[Islamic jurisprudence|jurisprudence schools]] (''[[madhhab]]'') reflecting different methodologies of jurisprudence (''[[fiqh]]'').

The major Sunni madhhabs are [[Hanafi]], [[Maliki]], [[Shafi'i]], and [[Hanbali]].

The major [[Shi'a]] branches are [[Twelver]] (Imami), [[Ismaili]] (Sevener) and [[Zaidiyyah|Zaidi]] (Fiver). [[Isma'ilism]] later split into [[Nizari Ismaili]] and [[Musta’li Ismaili]], and then [[Mustaali]] was divided into [[Hafizi]] and [[Taiyabi Ismaili]]s.&lt;ref name="Öz1"&gt;Öz, Mustafa, ''Mezhepler Tarihi ve Terimleri Sözlüğü (The History of [[madh'hab]]s and its terminology dictionary),'' Ensar Publications, [[İstanbul]], 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; It also gave rise to the [[Qarmatian]] movement and the [[Druze]] faith. Twelver Shiism developed [[Ja'fari jurisprudence]] whose branches are [[Akhbarism]] and [[Usulism]], and other movements such as [[Alawites]], [[Shayki]]sm&lt;ref name="Meymun"&gt;"Muhammad ibn Āliyy’ūl Cillī [[aqidah]]" of "Maymūn ibn [[Al-Tabarani|Abu’l-Qāsim Sulaiman ibn Ahmad ibn at-Tabarānī]] [[fiqh]]" (Sūlaiman Affandy, ''Al-Bākūrat’ūs Sūlaiman’īyyah – [[Family tree]] of the [[Nusayri]] [[Tariqat]],'' pp. 14–15, [[Beirut]], 1873.)&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Alevism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cemvakfi.org.tr/alevi-islam-din-hizmetleri-baskanligi/alevi-islam-din-hizmetleri-baskanligi/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120110124358/http://www.cemvakfi.org.tr/alevi-islam-din-hizmetleri-baskanligi/alevi-islam-din-hizmetleri-baskanligi/|dead-url=yes|archive-date=10 January 2012|title=Alevi İslam Din Hizmetleri Başkanlığı|publisher=|accessdate=5 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Shi'ism"&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = Edinburgh University Press| isbn = 978-0-7486-1888-0| last = Halm| first = Heinz| title = Shi'ism| date = 21 July 2004| page=154| title-link = Shi'ism}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly, [[Kharijites]] were initially divided into five major branches: [[Sufri]]s, [[Azariqa]], [[Najdat]], Adjarites and [[Ibadis]]. Among these numerous branches, only [[Hanafi]], [[Maliki]], [[Shafi'i]], [[Hanbali]], [[Imamiyyah]]-[[Ja'fari jurisprudence|Ja'fari]]-[[Usuli]], [[Nizārī Ismā'īlī]], [[Alevi]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aleviislamdinhizmetleri.com/basinda_biz.asp?id=5 Alevi-Islam Religious Services – The message of İzzettin Doğan] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304081230/http://www.aleviislamdinhizmetleri.com/basinda_biz.asp?id=5# |date=4 March 2016 }}, Zafer Mah.

In addition, new schools of thought and movements like [[Quranist Muslims]], [[Ahmadi Muslims]] and [[African American Muslims]] later emerged independently.

===Refugees===
According to the [[UNHCR]], Muslim-majority countries hosted 18 million refugees by the end of 2010.{{Citation needed|date=November 2017}}

===Literacy===
The literacy rate in the Muslim world varies. [[Azerbaijan]] is in second place in the Index of Literacy of World Countries. Some members such as Iran, Kuwait, Kazakhstan, Tajikistan and Turkmenistan have over 97% literacy rates, whereas literacy rates are the lowest in [[Mali]], [[Afghanistan]], [[Chad]] and parts of [[Africa]]. In 2015, the International Islamic News Agency reported that nearly 37% of the population of the Muslim world is unable to read or write, basing that figure on reports from the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation and the Islamic Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Nearly 40% of Muslim world’s population unable read or write: IINA Report|url=http://www.iinanews.com/page/public/report.aspx?id=10377#.Vm81VPkrLIU|accessdate=14 December 2015|agency=International Islamic News Agency|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151222120828/http://www.iinanews.com/page/public/report.aspx?id=10377#.Vm81VPkrLIU#.Vm81VPkrLIU|archive-date=22 December 2015|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Arts===
The term "[[Islamic art]] and [[Islamic architecture|architecture]]" denotes the works of art and architecture produced from the 7th century onwards by people who lived within the territory that was inhabited by culturally Islamic populations.&lt;ref&gt;Ettinghausen (2003), p. 3{{Clarify|date=November 2010|reason=Need full name and work cited}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Islamic Art and Architecture", ''The Columbia Encyclopedia'' (2000)&lt;/ref&gt;

====Architecture====
{{Main|Islamic architecture}}
Encompasses both secular and religious styles, the design and style made by Muslims and their construction of buildings and structures in Islamic culture included the architectural types: the Mosque, the Tomb, the Palace and the Fort. Perhaps the most important expression of Islamic art is architecture, particularly that of the mosque.&lt;ref name="B-I"&gt;"Islam", ''The New Encyclopædia Britannica'' (2005)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- just to note, this Britannica subsection is signed by Fazl-ur Rahman --&gt; Through Islamic architecture, effects of varying cultures within Islamic civilization can be illustrated. Generally, the use of [[Islamic geometric patterns]] and foliage based [[Arabesque (Islamic art)|arabesques]] were striking. There was also the use of decorative [[calligraphy]] instead of [[pictures]] which were [[haram]] (forbidden) in mosque architecture. Note that in secular architecture, human and animal representation was indeed present.

The North African and Iberian Islamic architecture, for example, has [[Roman Empire|Roman]]-[[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] elements, as seen in the [[Mosque of Uqba|Great Mosque of Kairouan]] which contains marble columns from Roman and Byzantine buildings,&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=LgnhYDozENgC&amp;pg=PA175&amp;dq=mosque+kairouan+roman+columns&amp;hl=fr&amp;ei=-axbTKGaNs2aOIqI4aYP&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=8&amp;ved=0CFMQ6AEwBzge#v=onepage&amp;q=mosque%20kairouan%20roman%20columns&amp;f=false Elizabeth Allo Isichei, ''A history of African societies to 1870'', p. 175. Cambridge University Press, 1997]. Books.google.com (13 April 1997). Retrieved on 11 May 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; in the [[Alhambra]] palace at [[Granada]], or in the [[Cathedral–Mosque of Córdoba|Great Mosque of Cordoba]].

Persian-style mosques are characterized by their tapered brick pillars, large [[Arcade (architecture)|arcades]], and arches supported each by several pillars. In South Asia, elements of [[Hindu temple architecture|Hindu architecture]] were employed, but were later superseded by Persian designs.

====Aniconism====
{{Main|Aniconism in Islam}}
No Islamic visual images or depictions of [[God in Islam|God]] are meant to exist because it is believed that such artistic depictions may lead to [[idolatry]]. Moreover, Muslims believe that God is [[Spirit|incorporeal]], making any two- or three- dimensional depictions impossible. Instead, Muslims describe God by the [[Names of God in Islam|names and attributes]] that, according to Islam, he revealed to his creation. All but one [[sura]] of the Quran begins with the phrase "[[Basmala|In the name of God, the Beneficent, the Merciful]]". Images of Mohammed are likewise prohibited. Such [[aniconism]] and [[iconoclasm]]&lt;ref name=MUSLIM-ICONOCLASM&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; can also be found in Jewish and some Christian [[theology]].

====Arabesque====
{{Main|Arabesque (Islamic art)}}
Islamic art frequently adopts the use of geometrical floral or vegetal designs in a repetition known as [[Arabesque (Islamic art)|arabesque]]. Such designs are highly nonrepresentational, as Islam forbids representational depictions as found in [[Arabian mythology|pre-Islamic pagan religions]]. Despite this, there is a presence of depictional art in some Muslim societies, notably the [[Persian miniature|miniature]] style made famous in [[Achaemenid Empire|Persia]] and under the [[Ottoman Empire]] which featured paintings of people and animals, and also depictions of Quranic stories and Islamic traditional narratives. Another reason why Islamic art is usually abstract is to symbolize the transcendence, indivisible and infinite nature of God, an objective achieved by arabesque.&lt;ref name="JAACMadden"&gt;Madden (1975), pp. 423–30&lt;/ref&gt; [[Islamic calligraphy]] is an omnipresent decoration in Islamic art, and is usually expressed in the form of Quranic verses. Two of the main scripts involved are the symbolic ''[[kufic]]'' and ''[[Naskh (script)|naskh]]'' scripts, which can be found adorning the walls and domes of [[mosque]]s, the sides of [[minbar]]s, and so on.&lt;ref name="JAACMadden"/&gt;

Distinguishing [[Motif (visual arts)|motifs]] of Islamic architecture have always been ordered repetition, radiating structures, and rhythmic, metric patterns. In this respect, [[fractal]] geometry has been a key utility, especially for mosques and palaces. Other features employed as motifs include columns, [[Pier (architecture)|piers]] and arches, organized and interwoven with alternating sequences of niches and colonnettes.&lt;ref&gt;Tonna, Jo (1990). "The Poetics of Arab-Islamic Architecture", Muqarnas BRILL, 7, pp. 182–97&lt;/ref&gt; The role of domes in Islamic architecture has been considerable. Its usage spans centuries, first appearing in 691 with the construction of the [[Dome of the Rock]] mosque, and recurring even up until the 17th century with the [[Taj Mahal]]. And as late as the 19th century, Islamic domes had been incorporated into European architecture.&lt;ref&gt;Grabar, Oleg (2006), "Islamic art and beyond". Ashgate. Vol 2, p. 87&lt;/ref&gt;

===Calendar===

The Islamic calendar, Muslim calendar or Hijri calendar (AH) is a [[lunar calendar]] consisting of 12 months in a year of 354 or 355 days. It is used to date events in many Muslim-majority countries and determines the proper days on which to observe the annual fast (see [[Ramadan]]), to attend [[Hajj]], and to celebrate other Islamic holidays and festivals.

====Solar Hijri calendar====
[[File:Jalaali_Leap_Year.svg|thumb|[[Jalali calendar]] also called [[Solar Hijri calendar]].]]

The Solar Hijri calendar, also called the Shamsi Hijri calendar, and abbreviated as SH, is the official calendar of Iran and Afghanistan. It begins on the [[vernal equinox]]. Each of the twelve months corresponds with a zodiac sign. The first six months have 31 days, the next five have 30 days, and the last month has 29 days in usual years but 30 days in leap years. The year of Prophet [[Muhammad]]'s migration to [[Medina]] (622 CE) is fixed as the first year of the calendar, and the New Year's Day always falls on the [[March equinox]].

===Law and ethics===
{{unreferenced section|date=January 2018}}

]]

In some nations, Muslim ethnic groups enjoy considerable [[autonomy]].

In some places, Muslims implement Islamic law, called sharia in Arabic. The Islamic law exists in a number of variations, but the main forms are the five (four [[Sunni Islam|Sunni]] and one [[Shia Islam|Shia]]) and Salafi and Ibadi [[Madh'hab|schools of jurisprudence]] ([[fiqh]]){{clarify|what is the following bulletized list in aid of? What is its objective? Lebanon does not implement sharia, for example. Six forms are listed below, five are counted above|date=March 2013}}
* [[Hanafi]] school in Pakistan, North India, Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Turkey, Albania, Kosovo, Bosnia and Herzegovina, other Balkan States, Lower Egypt, Spain, Canada, Jordan, Lebanon, Iraq, Russia, Caucasus Republics, China, Central Asian Republics, European Union, other countries of North and South America.
* [[Maliki]] in North Africa, West Africa, Sahel, Qatar, United Arab Emirates and Kuwait.
* [[Shafi'i]] in Malaysia, Indonesia, Brunei, Eritrea, Somalia, Yemen, Maldives, Sri Lanka and [[South India]]
* [[Hanbali]] in Saudi Arabia,
* [[Ja'fari jurisprudence|Jaferi]] in Iran, Iraq, Bahrain and Azerbaijan. These four are the only "Muslim states" where the majority is Shia population. In Yemen, Pakistan, India, Afghanistan, Tajikistan, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Turkey, and Syria, are countries with Sunni populations. In Lebanon, the majority Muslims (54%) were about equally divided between Sunni and Shia in 2010.
* [[Ibadi]] in Oman and small regions in North Africa

In a [[Hijab by country|number of Muslim-majority countries]] the law requires women to cover either their legs, shoulders and head, or the whole body apart from the face. In strictest forms, the face as well must be covered leaving just a mesh to see through. These [[List of types of sartorial hijab|hijab rules for dressing]] cause tensions, concerning particularly Muslims living in [[Western world|Western]] countries, where restrictions are considered both sexist and oppressive. Some Muslims oppose this charge, and instead declare that the media in these countries presses on women to reveal too much in order to be deemed attractive, and that this is itself sexist and oppressive.

===Politics===
{{Further|Islamic revival|Liberal movements within Islam}}
[[File:Benazir bhutto 1988.jpg|thumb|[[Benazir Bhutto]], the former [[prime minister of Pakistan]] became the first woman elected to lead a Muslim-majority country.&lt;ref&gt;"Benazir Bhutto: Daughter of Tragedy" by Muhammad Najeeb, Hasan Zaidi, Saurabh Shulka and S. Prasannarajan, ''India Today'', 7 January 2008&lt;/ref&gt;]]

During much of the 20th century, the Islamic identity and the dominance of Islam on political issues have arguably increased during the early 21st century. The fast-growing interests of the [[Western world]] in Islamic regions, international conflicts and [[globalization]] have changed the influence of Islam on the world in [[contemporary history]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20110217233807/http://www.islamonline.net/servlet/Satellite?c=Article_C&amp;cid=1212925100226&amp;pagename=Zone-English-ArtCulture%2FACELayout Milestones of Islamic History]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Islamism====
{{refimprove section|date=January 2018}}
Some people in Muslim-majority countries also see Islam manifested politically as [[Islamism]].&lt;ref&gt;Political Islam: Religion and Politics in the Arab World. By Nazih Ayub. Routledge, 19 June 2004. p. 9&lt;/ref&gt; Political Islam is powerful in some Muslim-majority countries. [[Islamic party|Islamic parties]] in Turkey, Pakistan and Algeria have taken power at the provincial level. Some in these movements call themselves Islamists, which also sometimes describes more militant Islamic groups. The relationships between these groups (in democratic countries there is usually at least one Islamic party) and their views of democracy are complex.

Some of these groups are accused of practicing [[Islamic terrorism]].

====Islam-based intergovernmental organizations====
{{unreferenced section|date=January 2018}}
{{Life in OIC}}
The [[Organisation of Islamic Cooperation]] (OIC) is an inter-governmental organization [[Member states of the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation|grouping fifty-seven states]]. 49 are Muslim-majority countries, the others have significant Muslim minorities. The organization claims to be the collective voice of the Muslim world to safeguard the interest and ensure the progress and well-being of their peoples and those of other Muslims in the world over.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}

[[Image:Mutlaa.jpg|thumb|300px|right|The view from the Mutla Ridge]]
The '''Mutla Ridge''' is located in [[Jahra Governorate]]. It is the highest point in [[Kuwait]], standing at 1,004 feet ( 306 metres) high.

{{Coord|29|23|N|47|38|E|region:KW_type:city|display=title}}

==History==
During the  [[Gulf War]], the [[Iraq]] forces were going to launch bombs while they were on the ridge to threaten [[Saudi Arabia]]. In February 1991, American aircraft attacked retreating Iraqi forces fleeing Kuwait in the direction of [[Basra]] on the "[[Highway of Death]]."

Coalition forces later used the rocky outcropping for communication towers, to communicate with troops in Iraq.

During operation "[[Operation Desert Spring|Desert Spring]]" in 2003, a detachment of the [[Oklahoma]] [[United States National Guard|National Guard]] 45th division 1/179 infantry B company followed by the [[Indiana National Guard]] watched and defended the outpost until late in the war, when they were moved to [[Ali Air Base|Tallil Air Base]] in [[Iraq]]. Also watching over the Ridge in 2003, was the 946th Transportation Co., a reserve unit, out of Lewes, DE.

'''Natura 2000''' is a network of [[protected area|nature protection areas]] in the territory of the [[European Union]]. It is made up of [[Special Areas of Conservation]] (SACs) and [[Special Protection Area]]s (SPAs) designated respectively under the [[Habitats Directive]] and [[Birds Directive]]. The network includes both terrestrial and marine sites ([[Marine protected area#Europe|Marine Protected Areas]] (MPAs)).

==History==
In May 1992, the governments of the [[History of the European Communities (1973–1993)|European Communities]] adopted legislation designed to protect the most seriously threatened [[habitat]]s and [[species]] across Europe. The [[Habitats Directive]] complements the [[Birds Directive]] adopted earlier in 1979 and together they make up the Natura 2000 network of protected areas.

The Birds Directive requires the establishment of [[Special Protection Area]]s (SPAs) for birds. The Habitats Directive similarly requires [[Sites of Community Importance]] (SCIs) which upon the agreement of the European  Commission become [[Special Areas of Conservation]] (SACs) to be designated for species other than birds, and for habitat types (e.g. particular types of forest, grasslands, wetlands, etc.). Together, SPAs and SACs form the Natura 2000 network of protected areas.

Furthermore, the Natura 2000 network is the EU contribution to the "[[Emerald network]]" of Areas of Special Conservation Interest (ASCIs) set up under the [[Convention on the Conservation of European Wildlife and Natural Habitats|Bern Convention on the conservation of European wildlife and natural habitats]]. Natura 2000 is also a key contribution to the Program of Work of Protected Areas of the Convention on Biological Diversity.

As prerequisite for becoming EU Member, accession states have to submit proposals for Natura 2000 sites meeting the same criteria as EU Member States. Some new member states have large areas which qualify to be protected under the directives and implementation has not always been simple.&lt;ref name="RP"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

The Natura 2000 sites are selected by Member States and the European Commission following strictly scientific criteria according to the two directives mentioned above. The SPAs are designated directly by each [[Member state of the European Union|EU Member State]], while the SACs follow a more elaborated process: each EU Member State must compile a list of the best wildlife areas containing the habitats and species listed in the Habitats Directive; this list must then be submitted to the [[European Commission]], after which an evaluation and selection process on European level will take place in order to become a Natura 2000 site.

The Habitats Directive divides the EU territory into nine biogeographic regions &lt;ref&gt;[http://ec.europa.eu/environment/nature/natura2000/sites_hab/biogeog_regions/index_en.htm Natura 2000 Habitats Directive Sites according to Biogeographical Regions] last retrieved 31-10-14&lt;/ref&gt; each with its own ecological coherence. Natura 2000 sites are selected according to the conditions in each biogeographical region, thus selected sites represent species and habitat types under similar natural conditions across a suite of countries.

Each Natura 2000 site has a unique identification form called Standard Data Form (SDF). This form is used as a legal reference when assessing the management of the species and habitats through the concept of favourable conservation status. The Natura 2000 Viewer &lt;ref&gt;[http://natura2000.eea.europa.eu/ Natura 2000 network viewer] last retrieved 31-10-14&lt;/ref&gt; is a tool to explore the network and gives access to every SDF.

==Current status==
Natura 2000 protects 27,312 sites with terrestrial area 787,606&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; (around 18 percent of land of the EU countries) and marine area 360,350&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; in 2017,&lt;ref&gt;[http://ec.europa.eu/environment/nature/natura2000/barometer/index_en.htm Natura 2000 Barometer] last retrieved 14 July 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; and is considered almost complete in the EU terrestrial environment. The process of designation has not always been smooth as the infringement procedures against Member States show.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ec.europa.eu/environment/legal/law/press_en.htm European Commission website] last retrieved 31-10-14&lt;/ref&gt; While designation of sites may be near complete, the management and enforcement of protection on sites is less advanced and many sites lack management plans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.birdlife.org/sites/default/files/attachments/On-the-Road-to-Recovery.pdf|title=On the Road to Recovery?|publisher=|accessdate=7 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Natura 2000 faced criticism from developers, farmers and politicians who fear that the conservation of habitats and species places a brake on development.&lt;ref&gt;Beunen, R., Van Assche, K., Duineveld, M. (2013) [http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264837712001330 Performing failure in nature conservation. The implementation of European Union directives in the Netherlands]. Land Use Policy 31: 280-288&lt;/ref&gt;

251,564&amp;nbsp;km squared had been designated as Natura 2000 in the marine environment in 2013. The network in marine areas is not considered complete and acknowledged by the Commission as a “key challenge for EU [[biodiversity]] policy in the coming years”.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ec.europa.eu/environment/nature/natura2000/marine/index_en.htm European Commission Natura 2000 in the marine environment] last retrieved 31-10-14&lt;/ref&gt;

Natura 2000 sites can vary considerably in character. They are not strictly protected in terms of how they are allowed to be used by people. Many sites are farmed, forested and some are even in urban areas. Other areas are much wilder. The [[European Commission]] developed guidelines on the relation between Natura 2000 and wild areas which are thought to make up around 13% of the network.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ec.europa.eu/environment/nature/natura2000/wilderness/index_en.htm European Commission  Wilderness in Europe] last retrieved 31-10-14&lt;/ref&gt; This was in response to a report by [[Member of the European Parliament|Members of the European Parliament]] in 2009 which called for further protection of Europe's wilderness.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/public/story_page/064-47957-033-02-06-911-20090202STO47940-2009-02-02-2009/default_en.htm MEPs Respond to Call to Protect Europe] last retrieved 04-02-09&lt;/ref&gt;

==Raising awareness about Natura 2000 amongst the general public==

The Natura 2000 network is not well known among European Union citizens; only 11% of citizens knew what it was in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/public_opinion/flash/fl_379_sum_en.pdf|title=Attitudes towards Biodiversity. Flash Eurobarometer 379|publisher=|accessdate=7 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; As part of the [[EU Biodiversity Strategy]], the European Commission committed to raise awareness about the network and biodiversity in general with the public.

In general, Natura 2000 Sites are seen like an interdiction for developing for most of the citizens. Since appeared in some area, the citizens saw only limitations and interdictions without any local advantages for the specific area. The confusion is even greater since in the designation process as a Natura 2000 Site, the local communities were not involved. The documentations for different areas were done by different NGO not belonging to specific areas without out knowing the areas, with limited studies and ignoring the local communities interests.Due to this lack of awareness, most citizens do not know the consequence of belonging to a Natura 2000 Site.{{cn|date=November 2017}}

===Natura 2000 Day===
In order to raise awareness about the Natura 2000 network, 21 May has been designated “Natura 2000 Day”. This precedes “International Day for Biological Diversity” on 22 May. The initiative came from [[SEO/BirdLife]] who sought and received funding from the EU [[The LIFE Programme|LIFE+]] programme in order to improve the knowledge of this network.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://activarednatura2000.com/en/proyecto-life/|title=Project Life   Activates your true wealth.|publisher=|accessdate=7 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, the first Natura 2000 day took place with the aim to raise awareness of citizens about the importance of Natura 2000 network in their lives. Since then, every May 21 and the weeks before, awareness actions take place all over Europe. For example, in 2014, school children and politicians across the EU were encouraged to make a butterfly gesture and post photos on social media to raise awareness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.natura2000day.eu|title=Natura 2000 Day|website=www.natura2000day.eu|accessdate=7 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Natura 2000 Award===
The Natura 2000 Award &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/environment/nature/natura2000/awards/|title=European Natura 2000 Award - European Commission|website=ec.europa.eu|accessdate=7 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; was launched by the European Commission in 2013, with the first prizes awarded on Natura 2000 Day in 2014. The annual Award aims to raise awareness about the Natura 2000 network, showcase excellence and encourage networking between people working on Natura 2000 sites.

It awards prizes to those working on the management of or to raise awareness about Natura 2000 in five award categories: Conservation; Socio-Economic Benefits; Communication; Reconciling Interests and Perceptions; Cross-Border Cooperation and Networking. In its first year, winners were selected from Bulgaria, Romania, Czech Republic, Belgium and Spain.

== Controversy ==
In some member states, such as Bulgaria, the project had not been well communicated in advance. This led to construction in the Kaliakra zone of Bulgaria, including wind turbines and a golf course. Land owners have then been told they may not use their land in certain ways, otherwise non-compliance procedures would be used against Bulgaria. This led to protests by the land-owners. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.euscoop.com/en/2017/8/7/kalikara-protests-eu-environment|title=The Kaliakra protests: The Bulgarian People vs. The EU|access-date=2017-08-11|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A similar situation there is in Romania where, from one side the European Union and the Governrnent encouraged the investors to build green power plant like Small Hydro Power Plant and Wind Power Plants. The investors bought land, developed and/or already built projects and later to find out that the area is a Nature 2000 Site and they can not go further due to infringement risks.

Even worse, in some area in Romania, the communities and local authorities were not involved in the designation process as an area like a Site Nature 2000 and they found out later that they are limited in developing local projects like water pipes for towns, waste water pipes, highways and roads, etc.

In 2016 he became Executive Director of the [[Schwarzman Scholars]], an international leadership program at Tsinghua University in Beijing.&lt;ref&gt;http://schwarzmanscholars.org/news-article/schwarzman-scholars-appoints-world-renowned-scholar-to-be-executive-director/&lt;/ref&gt; He is the former [[Vice-Chancellor]] of the [[University of Warwick]], having served in the position from 2006 to 2016, and a leading academic in the field of [[human geography]].

==Early life and career==
Born in 1949, and educated at [[Nailsea School]] south west of Bristol, Thrift then studied geography at the [[University of Wales, Aberystwyth]] and did his PhD at the [[University of Bristol]].  Thrift has held posts at numerous universities, including the [[University of Wales, Aberystwyth]], the [[University of Wales, Lampeter]], the [[University of Bristol]], and the [[University of Oxford]].

In 2005 he was appointed vice-chancellor of the [[University of Warwick]], taking up the position in July 2006. He intended to retire at the end of the university’s 50th anniversary year in 2015, but extended by a month to the end of January 2016.&lt;ref name=P-20140213&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.birminghampost.co.uk/news/local-news/warwick-university-boss-step-down-6702603 |title=University of Warwick boss to step down |author=Graeme Brown |newspaper=Birmingham Post |date=13 February 2014 |accessdate=29 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thrift was [[Knight Bachelor|knighted]] in the 2015 New Year Honours for services to higher education.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=61092|supp=y|page=N2|date=31 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/391413/New_Year_Honours_List_2015.pdf 2015 New Year Honours List]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contribution to geography==
Thrift has been described as one of the world's leading human geographers&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20110718112202/http://www.rsgs.org/publications/TheGeographer-Spring09.pdf The Geographer Spring 2009 page 2]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Social science|social scientists]], and is credited with coining the phrase ''[[soft capitalism]]'' as well as originating [[non-representational theory]].  Thrift sits on a number of advisory committees for the UK government and was a member of the [[ESRC]] Research Priorities Board. In 1982 he co-founded the journal ''Environment and Planning D: Society and Space''&lt;ref&gt;http://www.envplan.com/epd/epdinfo.html&lt;/ref&gt; whilst serving as managing editor, since 1979, of ''Environment and Planning A''.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.envplan.com/epa/epainfo.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Thrift's early work was most readily associated with economic geography and the effects of [[Capitalist mode of production (Marxist theory)|capitalist mode of production]] on spatial relations, conceptions of time, and labour markets. Latterly, and controversially for early collaborators like [[Richard Peet]], he moved towards [[poststructuralism]] with attention to subjectivity, representation, identity, and practice in Western societies. In one theory, Thrift coins the term ''qualculation.'' In ''Movement-Space: The Changing Domain of Thinking Resulting From the Development of New Kinds of Spatial Awareness'', Nigel Thrift explains the concept: “calculation has become so ubiquitous that it has entered a new phase, which I call ‘qualculation’, an activity arising out of the construction of new generative microworlds which allow many millions of calculations continually to be made in the background of any encounter.” (Thrift 584)

A book with Ash Amin published in 2013 was critical of 'left politics', and by this time he was managing an entrepreneurial university.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://societyandspace.com/reviews/reviews-archive/ash-amin-and-nigel-thrift-2013-arts-of-the-political-reviewed-by-dave-featherstone/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-02-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160120234242/http://societyandspace.com/reviews/reviews-archive/ash-amin-and-nigel-thrift-2013-arts-of-the-political-reviewed-by-dave-featherstone/ |archivedate=20 January 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; His work on time, [[language]], [[Power (social and political)|power]], [[representations]], and the [[Human body|body]] has been influential, and it has been suggested that Thrift's career reflects and in some cases spurred substantial intellectual changes in human geography in the 1980s and 1990s.

Most recently he has written on what he terms non-representational theory, which stresses performative and embodied knowledges and is a radical attempt to wrench the social sciences and humanities out of an emphasis on representation and interpretation by moving away from contemplative models of thought and action to those based on practice. Thrift has claimed that non-representational theory addresses the "unprocessual" nature of much of social and cultural theory. Major themes within non-representational theory include subjectification, space as a verb, technologies of being, embodiment, and play and excess. Non-representational theory has provoked substantial debate within the field of human geography around the limits of the mediation of our world through language and how we might see, sense, and communicate beyond it

Thrift has also edited and authored a number of textbooks, encyclopaedias, and primers in human geography.

== University Leadership ==
At Oxford, Thrift served as head of the Life and Environmental Sciences Division before becoming Pro-Vice-Chancellor for Research. In interviews, he hints that his time at Oxford was less than satisfying.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/education/2007/sep/11/highereducationprofile.highereducation&lt;/ref&gt;

Thrift's role as Vice Chancellor at Warwick saw him launch several new initiatives, boosting the  University's presence in London (an expansion of the Business School in [[The Shard]] building) and overseas (through a strong partnership with [[Monash University]], and with plans to develop a campus in California). Warwick is now ranked in the world's top 100 universities, and in the top 10 in the UK.&lt;ref&gt;https://www2.warwick.ac.uk/about/profile/ranking/&lt;/ref&gt; During Thrift's tenure, job cuts to those without sufficient research income in the Medical School and Life Sciences were controversial and provoked acute resentment.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.timeshighereducation.com/news/simplistic-redundancy-metrics-criticised/2016357.article&lt;/ref&gt; and the incongruity between his progressive writings and his corporatisation of the university has been noted by commentators &lt;ref&gt;http://warwickglobalist.com/2016/02/02/yobs-principles-and-higher-education-a-decade-of-nigel-thrift/&lt;/ref&gt;

Thrift was a chair of a section of the British [[Research Assessment Exercise]] (Main Panel H, 2005–07 and member, 2001 Panel for Geography), chaired the Industry Commission on Higher Education (2012-) and the [[IPPR]] Commission on the Future of Higher Education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.debretts.com/people-of-today/profile/22543/Nigel-John-THRIFT |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-02-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160308071149/http://www.debretts.com/people-of-today/profile/22543/Nigel-John-THRIFT |archivedate=8 March 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Controversies==
In the financial year 2011–12, Thrift's salary rose by £50,000 (21%) to £288,000.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.asp?sectioncode=26&amp;storycode=422329&lt;/ref&gt; Some students claimed that the pay raise was unjustified in light of Warwick's performance in international university league tables, but their protests were rebuffed. In June 2013 when a pay rise of £42,000 (to £316,000) was announced, a small number of students again protested. The grounds were that the raise went against university cutbacks to staff and student support/bursaries.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/education/2013/jun/19/students-occupy-warwick-university-in-protest-against-vice-chancellor-pay-rise&lt;/ref&gt; In the same year, English professor and outspoken critic of the corporatisation and marketisation of Higher Education, Prof. Thomas Docherty, was controversially suspended for some months for 'insubordination' in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.oxonianreview.org/wp/an-interview-with-thomas-docherty/&lt;/ref&gt;

Thrift's pay increase of £16,000 announced in December 2014, was again met with protests.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.coventrytelegraph.net/news/coventry-news/warwick-university-bosss-16k-pay-6475047&lt;/ref&gt; On 3 December 2014 police used CS spray to tackle protests at the University of Warwick, after a security guard was assaulted&lt;ref&gt;http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/news/police-use-cs-spray-to-tackle-warwick-student-protest/2017382.article&lt;/ref&gt; (two protestors, including a student were later prosecuted&lt;ref&gt;http://www.coventrytelegraph.net/news/coventry-news/two-found-guilty-after-university-9632675&lt;/ref&gt;). Thrift issued a written statement that denounced the alleged violence.&lt;ref&gt;http://www2.warwick.ac.uk/insite/news/intnews2/vice-chancellor_december_protest/&lt;/ref&gt; This was rapidly followed by a petition calling for Thrift's knighthood to be rescinded, with over 350 signatures.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/news/warwick-v-c-nigel-thrift-targeted-by-petition-over-knighthood/2017879.article&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/higher-education/vcs-knighthood-a-double-edged-sword/story-e6frgcjx-1227185458042?nk=3b730c7ca17a97fec17cc33eb9b625dd | work=The Australian | title=VC's knighthood a double-edged sword}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ken Sloan, Warwick's then registrar, stated that Thrift has been "targeted personally and directly" by students, including being spat on and verbally assaulted near his home.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Grove|first1=Jack|title=Warwick v-c Nigel Thrift recorded calling student protesters ‘yobs’|url=https://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/news/warwick-v-c-nigel-thrift-recorded-calling-student-protesters-yobs/2019163.article|accessdate=6 August 2015|work=[[Times Higher Education]]|date=March 17, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Pillars of Creation''''' is a photograph taken by the [[Hubble Space Telescope]] of [[Elephant trunk (astronomy)|elephant trunks]] of [[interstellar gas]] and dust in the [[Eagle Nebula]], specifically the Serpens constellation, some 6,500–7,000 [[light year]]s from Earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/WISE/news/wise20110304.html |title='Elephant Trunks' in Space |last=Clavin |first=Whitney |accessdate=March 9, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are so named because the gas and dust are in the process of creating new stars, while also being eroded by the light from nearby stars that have recently formed.&lt;ref name="hubble_release"&gt;[http://hubblesite.org/newscenter/archive/releases/1995/44/image/a/ Embryonic Stars Emerge from Interstellar "Eggs"], Hubble news release&lt;/ref&gt; Taken on April 1, 1995, it was named one of the top ten photographs from Hubble by [[Space.com]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20090523151950/http://www.space.com/bestimg/index.php?guid=41e56379672e2&amp;cat=hst Best Hubble Space telescope images] from [[Space.com]]. [archived copy]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[astronomers]] responsible for the photo were Jeff Hester and Paul Scowen from [[Arizona State University]]. The region was rephotographed by [[European Space Agency|ESA]]'s [[Herschel Space Observatory]] in 2011, and again by the Hubble in 2014 with a newer camera ([[#Hubble revisit|see below]]).

== Name ==
The name is based on a phrase used by [[Charles Spurgeon]] in his sermon "The Condescension of Christ":&lt;ref&gt;David H. Devorkin and Robert W. Smith. (2015). The Hubble Cosmos. ''National Geographic Magazine'', page&amp;nbsp;67&lt;/ref&gt;
:In calling the Hubble's spectacular new image of the Eagle Nebula the ''Pillars of Creation'', NASA scientists were tapping a rich symbolic tradition with centuries of meaning, bringing it into the modern age. As much as we associate pillars with the classical temples of Greece and Rome, the concept of the pillars of creation – the very foundations that hold up the world and all that is in it – reverberates significantly in the Christian tradition. When William Jennings Bryan published ''The World's Famous Orations'' in 1906, he included an 1857 sermon by London pastor Charles Haddon Spurgeon titled "The Condescension of Christ". In it, Spurgeon uses the phrase to convey not only the physical world but also the force that keeps it all together, emanating from the divine: "And now wonder, ye angels," Spurgeon says of the birth of Christ, "the Infinite has become an infant; he, upon whose shoulders the universe doth hang, hangs at his mother's breast. he who created all things, and bears up the pillars of creation."

== Composition ==
[[File:Eagle Nebula 4xHubble WikiSky.jpg|thumb|The Pillars of Creation within the [[Eagle Nebula]] (center of photo, overlaid with the original [[Hubble Space Telescope|HST]] image)]]
The pillars are composed of cool [[molecular hydrogen]] and dust that are being eroded by [[photoevaporation]] from the [[ultraviolet]] light of relatively close and hot [[stars]]. The leftmost pillar is about four [[light year]]s in length.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/origins/hubb-16.html |title=NOVA &amp;#124; Origins &amp;#124; The Pillars of Creation image 1 |publisher=[[PBS]] |date= |accessdate=2012-02-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The finger-like protrusions at the top of the clouds are larger than our [[solar system]], and are made visible by the shadows of [[evaporating gaseous globule]]s (EGGs), which shield the gas behind them from intense UV flux.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://csep10.phys.utk.edu/astr162/lect/birth/proto.html |title=The Birth of Stars |publisher=Csep10.phys.utk.edu |date= |accessdate=2012-02-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; EGGs are themselves incubators of new stars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1995/11/03/us/a-stunning-view-inside-an-incubator-for-stars.html |title=A Stunning View Inside an Incubator for Stars – New York Times |publisher=Nytimes.com |date=1995-11-03 |accessdate=2012-02-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The stars then emerge from the EGGs, which then are evaporated.

== Theorized destruction ==
Images taken with the [[Spitzer Space Telescope]] uncovered a cloud of hot dust in the vicinity of the Pillars of Creation that Nicolas Flagey accounted to be a shock wave produced by a [[supernova]].&lt;ref name=Flagey2009&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Flagey |first1=Nicholas |journal=Bulletin of the American Astronomical Society |title=The Eagle Nebula Unveiled by the Spitzer/MIPSGAL Survey |date=January 2009 |volume=41 |issue=1 |page=37 |display-authors=etal |bibcode=2009AAS...21332401F}}&lt;/ref&gt; The appearance of the cloud suggests the supernova shockwave would have destroyed the Pillars of Creation 6,000 years ago. Given the distance of roughly 7,000 light years to the Pillars of Creation, this would mean that they have actually already been destroyed, but because light [[speed of light|travels at a finite speed]], this destruction should be visible from Earth in about 1,000 years.&lt;ref name=destroyed&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2007/01/070110-pillars-creation.html |title=Photo in the News: Supernova Destroys "Pillars of Creation" |last=Lovett |first=Richard |accessdate=March 13, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this interpretation of the hot dust has been disputed by an astronomer uninvolved in the Spitzer observations, who argues that a supernova should have resulted in stronger [[radio wave|radio]] and [[x-ray]] radiation than has been observed, and that winds from massive stars could instead have heated the dust. If this is the case, the Pillars of Creation will undergo a more gradual erosion.&lt;ref name="ns_destruction"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn10925-pillars-of-creation-destroyed-by-supernova.html |title='Pillars of creation' destroyed by supernova |first=David |last=Shiga |date=January 10, 2007 |accessdate=May 4, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Photographs ==

===Original Hubble Space Telescope photo===
[[Hubble Space Telescope|Hubble's]] photo of the pillars is composed of 32 different images&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/origins/hubb-03.html |title=NOVA &amp;#124; Origins &amp;#124; The Pillars of Creation image 3 |publisher=PBS |date= |accessdate=2012-02-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; from four separate cameras&lt;ref name="pbs.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/origins/hubb-02.html |title=NOVA &amp;#124; Origins &amp;#124; The Pillars of Creation image 2 |publisher=PBS |date= |accessdate=2012-02-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the [[Wide Field and Planetary Camera 2]] on board Hubble.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/origins/hubb-01.html |title=NOVA &amp;#124; Origins &amp;#124; The Pillars of Creation image 1 |publisher=PBS |date=1995-04-01 |accessdate=2012-02-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The photograph was made with light emitted by different [[chemical element|elements]] in the cloud and appears as a different color in the composite image: green for [[hydrogen]], red for singly [[ionized]] [[sulfur]] and blue for double-ionized [[oxygen]] atoms.&lt;ref name="hubble_release"/&gt;

The "stair-shaped"&lt;ref name="pbs.org"/&gt; missing part of the picture at the top right corner originates from the fact that the camera for the top-right quadrant has a magnified view; when its images are scaled down to match the other three cameras, there is necessarily a gap in the rest of that quadrant.&lt;ref name="pbs.org"/&gt; This effect is also present on other four-camera Hubble pictures, and can be displayed at any corner depending on how the image has been re-oriented for publication.&lt;ref&gt;for example, [http://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/1312/seyfertsextet_HLAschmidt_1496.png this image] of [[Seyfert's Sextet]] has the effect at bottom-left corner&lt;/ref&gt;

The Wide Field and Planetary Camera 2 was replaced by the [[Wide Field Camera 3]], and the former was taken back to Earth where it is displayed in a museum. It was replaced in 2009 as part of  a Space Shuttle mission ([[STS-125]]).

=== Herschel's photo ===
In 2010 [[Herschel Space Observatory]] captured a new image of Pillars of Creation in [[far-infrared]] wavelengths, which allows astronomers to look inside the pillars and structures in the region, and come to a much fuller understanding of the creative and destructive forces inside the Eagle Nebula.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Revisiting the 'Pillars of Creation'|url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/herschel/news/herschel20120118.html|publisher=[[NASA]]|accessdate=2012-01-20|date=2012-01-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Hubble revisit ===
In celebration of the 25th anniversary since the launch of the Hubble Space Telescope, astronomers assembled a larger and higher-resolution photograph of the Pillars of Creation which was unveiled in January 2015 at the American Astronomical Society meeting in Seattle. The image was photographed by the Hubble Telescope's [[Wide Field Camera 3]], installed in 2009, in visible light. An infrared image was also taken.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hubble Goes High-Definition to Revisit Iconic 'Pillars of Creation'|url=http://www.nasa.gov/content/goddard/hubble-goes-high-definition-to-revisit-iconic-pillars-of-creation/|publisher=[[NASA]]|accessdate=2015-01-06|date=2015-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Tevno ezero i Kamenica.jpg|thumb|Tevno Vasilashko Lake in [[Pirin]].]]
'''Pirin Macedonia''' ([[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]]: Пиринска Македония, [[Macedonian language|Macedonian]]: Пиринска Македонија) is the smallest part of the geographical region [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonia]] located on the [[Balkan Peninsula]], today in southwestern [[Bulgaria]]. This region coincides with the borders of the [[Blagoevgrad Province|Blagoevgrad Oblast]], adding the surrounding area of the [[Barakovo, Bulgaria|Barakovo]] village from the [[Kyustendil Province]]. After World War I, [[Strumica]] and the surrounding area were broken away from the region and were ceded to [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]].

It covers an area of about 6,798 km2 which is 10.18% of the geographical region Macedonia. One of the regional centers is [[Blagoevgrad]], also known as Gorna Dzumaya, the old name of the city. The region is bordering with Kyustendil Province and [[Sofia Province]] on the north, [[Pazardzhik Province]] and [[Smolyan Province]] on the east, [[Greece]] on the south and [[Republic of Macedonia]] on the west. The population is estimated around 325.000 people.

==Etymology==
The name of this region comes from the [[Pirin|Pirin Mountains]] which are spread in the central part of Pirin Macedonia. The mountain name Pirin comes from [[Perun]] (Bulgarian: Перун), the highest god of the [[Slavic mythology|Slavic pantheon]] and the god of [[thunder]] and [[lightning]]. In the [[Classical antiquity|Antiquity]] the range was called ''Orbelos'' by the [[Thracians]], meaning "snow-white mountain" in [[Thracian language]].

==History==
It usually refers to the part of the region of [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonia]] attributed to the [[Kingdom of Bulgaria]] by the [[Treaty of Bucharest (1913)]]. Until World War I, in the region were included the areas present-day [[Strumica]] and [[Novo Selo (Novo Selo)|Novo Selo]] municipalities,  today in the Republic of Macedonia. After World War I, they were broken away from Bulgaria and ceded to [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]].

'''Roger Llewellyn Dunmore Cribb''' (6 January 1948 &amp;ndash; 24 August 2007) was an Australian archaeologist and anthropologist who specialised in documenting and modelling spatial patterns and social organisation of nomadic peoples. He is noted for conducting early fieldwork amongst the nomadic pastoralists of [[Anatolia]], Turkey; writing a book on the archaeology of these [[nomad]]s;&lt;ref name="CRIB1991"&gt;CRIBB, R (1991) &lt;u&gt;Nomads in Archaeology&lt;/u&gt;.

==Overview==
Dr Cribb's life's work is the work of a practical, [[applied research|applied]] [[social sciences|social scientist]]&lt;ref&gt;CRIBB, R (2000) ''The Shell Eaters''. Early incomplete draft of an unpublished draft manuscript Roger Cribb was working on, but never finished. Cairns. Australia&lt;/ref&gt; who firmly believed anthropological [[scientific modelling|model]]s, [[grounded theory|grounded]] and [[Occam's razor|parsimoniously]] applied, could reliably reach beyond our existing accumulated knowledge, into the [[archaeology|archaeological]] past of some of our oldest cultures in some of the more sparsely populated regions of our world: i.e. the [[nomadic pastoralism|nomadic pastoralists]] of [[Anatolia]] ([[Turkey]])&lt;ref name="CRIB1991"/&gt;&lt;ref name="CRIB1982"&gt;CRIBB, R (1982) ''The archaeological dimensions of near eastern nomadic pastoralism : towards a spatial model of unstable settlement systems'' Unpublished PhD Thesis, University of South Hampton, United Kingdom&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[hunter-gatherer|gatherer-hunters]] of [[Cape York Peninsula|Cape York]], (Australia).&lt;ref name="CWWT1988"&gt;CRIBB, R; WALMBENG, R; WOLMBY, R &amp; TAISMAN, C (1988) Landscape as cultural artefact: shell mounds and plants in Aurukun, Cape York Peninsula. Australian Aboriginal Studies. Number 2. Pages 60-73&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CRIB1996B"&gt;CRIBB, R (1996b) ''Shell mounds, domiculture and ecosystem manipulation on western Cape York Peninsula''. VETH, P &amp; HISCOCK, P (eds) &lt;u&gt;Archaeology of northern Australia: regional Perspectives&lt;/u&gt;. Tempus: archaeology and material culture studies in anthropology. University of Queensland, St Lucia. Volume 4. Pages 150-174&lt;/ref&gt;

Dr Cribb's research practice was to strive to undertake as much  '[[ethnography|ethnographic]]' fieldwork as possible with the peoples whose [[cultural heritage|heritage]] he wished to later unravel and reveal.&lt;ref name="CRIB1991"/&gt;&lt;ref name="GULC2007"&gt;[http://home.exetel.com.au/philspace/roger.html CRIBB, Gulcin (2007) ''Eulogy: Roger's Memorial Service'']. Cairns, Australia&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CRIB1987"&gt;CRIBB, R (1987) ''Aurukun Archaeology and Plant Survey 1987''. Unpublished tapes and data sheets recording places and local experts descriptions of plants and places, deposited with the Australian Institute of Aboriginal Studies, Canberra&lt;/ref&gt;  His preference was to store his (and other peoples) data within purpose-designed databases,&lt;ref name="CRSU1988"&gt;CRIBB, R &amp; SUTTON, P (1988) ''The Aurukun database project''. Unpublished report to the Australian Institute of Aboriginal Studies. Canberra.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CRIB1991D"&gt;CRIBB, R (1991d) ''Aboriginal Heritage in Queensland: Some Suggestions on the Collection, Control and Ownership of Data and Information: A Preliminary Discussion Paper.'' Unpublished paper prepared for the Tharpuntoo Legal Service Aboriginal Corporation&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=CRIB1995&gt;CRIBB, R (1995) Towards a Strategy for the Management of Aboriginal Cultural Heritage in the Wet Tropics. in FOURMILE, H; SCHNIERER, S; &amp; SMITH, A (Eds) &lt;u&gt;An Identification of Problems and Potential for Future Rainforest Aboriginal Cultural Survival and Self-Determination in the Wet Tropics.&lt;/u&gt; James Cook University's Centre for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Participation, Research and Development. Cairns, Australia. Pages 36-53.&lt;/ref&gt; and then apply small, efficient purpose-designed [[computer program]]s to analyze the data and distill, reveal, confirm, plus extrapolate social and environmental organising principles and patterns.&lt;ref name="CRIB1985"&gt;CRIBB, R (1985) ''The analysis of ancient herding systems: an application of computer simulation'' in BARKER, G &amp; GAMBLE, C (Eds) &lt;u&gt;Beyond Domestication in Prehistoric Europe. Investigations in Subsistence Archaeology and Social Complexity&lt;/u&gt;. Academic Press. New York. Pages 75-106.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CRIB1986B"&gt;CRIBB, R (1986b) ''Introducing the Concept of a Dedicated Spatial Analysis Package for Archaeology''. &lt;u&gt;Archaeological Computing Newsletter&lt;/u&gt;. Number 9&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CRIB1993"&gt;CRIBB, R (1993) ''Modelling relationships : a computerised approach to Aboriginal genealogy, family history and kinship studies''. &lt;u&gt;Australian Aboriginal Studies&lt;/u&gt;. Number 1. Pages 10 - 21&lt;/ref&gt; Organising principles and patterns 'discovered', were reapplied back into the original physical and biological landscapes, tested if possible, then extrapolated back in time&lt;ref name="CRIB1991"/&gt;&lt;ref name="CRIB1982"/&gt;

It is perhaps unfortunate that mid-career, for both mental and physical health reasons,&lt;ref name="BOYD2007"&gt;[http://home.exetel.com.au/philspace/roger.html BOYD, Peter (2007) ''Eulogy for Dr Roger L. D. Cribb''] Cairns, Australia&lt;/ref&gt; Dr Cribb found himself and his broader projects (in Cape York) having to proceed without academic patronage or funding.  From the early 1990s onwards Dr Cribb became increasingly disengaged from academic communities of scholars, tending to work instead within the [[non-conventional literature|grey]] (unpublished) fringes of more commercially driven (less '[[pure research|pure]]') research projects and programs.&lt;ref name="CRIB2000"&gt;CRIBB, R (2000) ''An Assessment of Comalco's Cultural Heritage Proposals''. Unpublished Report to the Cape York Land Council.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CRIB1992"&gt;CRIBB, R (1992)''Preliminary Report on the Excavation of an Aboriginal Midden Site at Bailey's Creek Mouth''. Unpublished report for Concrete Constructions Pty Ltd. Cairns, Australia&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=CRIB1994&gt;CRIBB, R (1994) ''Report on Traditional Ownership and Aboriginal heritage: Wangetti Crocodile Farm Project''. Unpublished report to the Queensland Department of Lands.&lt;/ref&gt;  Rapid developments in computer technologies and programming quickly overtook him, yet he continued for many years to work in those areas, with those peoples whose [[cultural landscape]]s he was most keen to understand, document, and help reveal to the world.&lt;ref name="CRIB2006"&gt;CRIBB, R (2006) ''Getting Around: Mobility, Lifestyle and Culture among Indigenous People''. Unpublished seminar presented as part of James Cook University's School of Anthropology and Archaeology Seminar Program. Cairns, Australia&lt;/ref&gt;

From Dr Cribb's works and his writings, it can be seen '[[terra nullius]]' myths offended his belief in pre-existing, largely unrevealed human heritage deeply imprinted into otherwise apparently 'empty' [[cultural landscape|landscapes]]&lt;ref name="CRIB1991B"&gt;CRIBB, R (1991B) ''Getting into a flap about shell mounds in northern Australia : a reply to Stone''. &lt;u&gt;Archaeology in Oceania&lt;/u&gt;. Volume 26. Number 1. Pages 23-25&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CRIB1991C"&gt;CRIBB, R (1991c)'' One lousey matchbox : a review of the Aboriginal Land Act 1991, Torres Strait Islander Land Act 1991 procedures manual : a discussion paper.'' Unpublished paper prepared for the Tharpuntoo Legal Service. Cairns, Australia.&lt;/ref&gt;

It might be said, Dr Cribb's most enduring professional contribution over a lifetime, was his work to counter all sense of 'terra nullius by recording large archaeological landscapes; facilitating archaeological heritage protection;  and revealing forever the richness, density and vastness of some of the [[cultural landscape]]s still persisting in Anatolia (Turkey), and Cape York (Australia).

'''Sloboda Ukraine''' ({{lang-rus|Слободская Украина|r=Slobodskaya Ukraina}}; {{lang-uk|Слобідська Україна|Slobids'ka Ukrayina}}) or '''Slobozhanshchyna''' ({{lang-uk|Слобожанщина}}, {{IPA-uk|slɔbɔˈʒɑnʃtʃɪnɐ|IPA}}; {{IPA-ru|sləbɐˈʐanʲɕːɪnə|lang}}) is a historical region, now located in Northeastern Ukraine and Southwestern Russia. It developed and flourished in the 17th and 18th centuries on the southwestern frontier of the [[Tsardom of Russia]]. In 1765 it was converted into the [[Kharkov Governorate|Sloboda Ukraine Governorate]].

==Etymology==

The name derives from the term ''[[sloboda]]'' for a colonial settlement free of tax obligations, and the word ''[[Name of Ukraine|ukraine]]'' in its original sense of "borderland". The etymology of the word Ukraine is seen this way among Russian,&lt;ref&gt;Vasmer Etymological Dictionary&lt;/ref&gt; Ukrainian and Western historians such as [[Orest Subtelny]],&lt;ref&gt;Orest Subtelny. Ukraine: A History. University of Toronto Press, 1988&lt;/ref&gt; [[Paul Magocsi]],&lt;ref&gt;A History of Ukraine.

In Ukraine, the region is accepted as a free settled region, part of the whole Ukraine.

==Geographical extent==
The territory of historic Sloboda Ukraine corresponds to the territory of the present-day [[Ukraine|Ukrainian]] [[oblast]] (province) of [[Kharkiv Oblast|Kharkiv]] (in its entirety), and parts of the [[Sumy Oblast|Sumy]], [[Donetsk Oblast|Donetsk]], and [[Luhansk Oblast]]s, as well as parts of the [[Belgorod Oblast|Belgorod]], [[Kursk Oblast|Kursk]], and [[Voronezh Oblast]]s of [[Russia]].&lt;ref name=KUW231114&gt;[http://ukrainianweek.com/History/123906 What Makes Kharkiv Ukrainian], [[The Ukrainian Week]] (23 November 2014)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin==
Russia gained control over the territory as the result of conquests against the [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]] during the [[Muscovite–Lithuanian Wars]] in the 16th century.

According to Russian and Ukrainian sources of the 16th-17th centuries, the region was initially part of the Russian state,&lt;ref&gt;Слюсарский А. Г. Социально-экономическое развитие Слобожанщины XVII— XVIII вв. Харьков. 1964. С. 11&lt;/ref&gt; which encouraged the settlement of this territory for defensive purposes.&lt;ref&gt;Слюсарский А. Г. Социально-экономическое развитие Слобожанщины XVII— XVIII вв. Харьков. 1964. С. 29&lt;/ref&gt; It was first colonised by the Russians in the first half of the 16th century and became part of a defense line used against [[Crimean Khanate|Tatar]] raiding.&lt;ref name=Davies44&gt;Brian Davies. Empire and Military Revolution in Eastern Europe: Russia's Turkish Wars in the Eighteenth Century. Bloomsbury Publishing. 2011. P. 44&lt;/ref&gt; A second wave of colonisation came in the 1620–1630s, largely in the form of Ukrainian [[cossack]] regiments, who were allowed to settle there in order to help protect the territory against the Tatars.&lt;ref name="Brian Davies 2011. P. 45"&gt;Brian Davies. Empire and Military Revolution in Eastern Europe: Russia's Turkish Wars in the Eighteenth Century. Bloomsbury Publishing. 2011.

P. 100&lt;/ref&gt; and resettled many of the Ukrainian refugees at Valuyki, [[Korocha]], [[Voronezh]] and as far as [[Michurinsk|Kozlov]].&lt;ref&gt;Brian Davies. Warfare, State and Society on the Black Sea Steppe, 1500–1700. Routledge. 2007. P. 101&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Crimean Tatars]] and [[Nogai Tatars]] traditionally used the sparsely inhabited area of the [[Wild Fields]] on the south border of Russia immediately south of [[Severia]] to launch annual raids into the Russian territories along the [[Muravsky Trail]] and [[Izyum Trail]].&lt;ref&gt;Слюсарский А. Г. Социально-экономическое развитие Слобожанщины XVII— XVIII вв. Харьков. 1964. С. 30&lt;/ref&gt; In 1591, a Tatar raid reached the Moscow region, forcing the Russian government to build new forts of [[Belgorod]] and [[Stary Oskol|Oskol]] in 1593, [[Yelets]] in 1592, [[Kromy, Oryol Oblast|Kromy]] in 1595, [[Kursk]] in 1597, Tsarev-Borisov and [[Valuyki]] in 1600.&lt;ref&gt;Слюсарский А. Г. Социально-экономическое развитие Слобожанщины XVII— XVIII вв. Харьков. 1964. С. 32&lt;/ref&gt; Tsarev-Borisov, named after Tsar [[Boris Godunov|Boris I]], was the oldest settlement in Sloboda Ukraine.&lt;ref&gt;Ісаєв Т. О. Цареборисів: від заснування до утворення Ізюмського слобідського полку // Вісник Харківського національного університету імені В. Н. Каразіна, 2010, No 906, С. 91&lt;/ref&gt; During those raids regions near [[Ryazan]] and along [[Oka River]] suffered the most. With the Russian territorial expansion south and east into the lands of modern Sloboda Ukraine and mid Volga River the conflict intensified. Sometime between 1580s and 1640s the ''Belgorod Defense Line'' with number of fortifications, moats, and forts was constructed in Sloboda Ukraine, providing security to the region. After a number of [[Russo-Crimean Wars]], the Russian monarchs started to encourage the settlement of the region by [[Cossacks]] who acted as a sort of frontier guard force against the raids of the Tatars.

[[File:Prelesne 0009.jpg|thumb|left|Folk architecture of Sloboda Ukraine]]
Apart from the Cossacks, the settlers included [[peasants]] and townspeople from [[Right-bank Ukraine|Right]] and [[Left-bank Ukraine]], divided by the [[Treaty of Andrusovo]] in 1667. The name ''Sloboda Ukraine'' derives from the word ''[[sloboda]]'', a [[Slavic languages|Slavic]] term meaning "freedom" (or "[[liberty]])", and also the name of a type of settlement. The Tsar would free the settlers of a ''sloboda'' from the obligation of paying taxes and fees for a certain period of time, which proved very enticing for settlers. By the end of the 18th century, settlers occupied 523 slobodas (''slobody'') in Sloboda Ukraine.

From 1650 to 1765, the territory referred to as Sloboda Ukraine became increasingly organized according to Cossack military custom, similar to that of the [[Zaporozhian Host]] and [[Don Cossacks|Don Host]]. The relocated cossacks became known as Sloboda Cossacks. There were five [[regiment]]al districts (''polky'') of Sloboda Cossacks, named after the towns of their sustained deployment, and subdivided into company districts (''sotni''). Regional centers included [[Ostrogozhsk]], [[Kharkiv]], [[Okhtyrka]], [[Sumy]], and [[Izyum]], while the Sloboda Ukraine Cossack capital was located in [[Sumy]] until 1743.

The administration of [[Catherine the Great]] disbanded the regiments of Slobozhanshchina and abolished Cossack privileges by the decree of July 28, 1765.&lt;ref name=KUW231114/&gt;  The semiautonomous region became a province called [[Sloboda Ukraine Governorate]] (''Slobodsko-Ukrainskaya guberniya'').&lt;ref name=KUW231114/&gt;&lt;ref name=Danilevsky&gt;{{cite book | author = [[Grigory Danilevsky]] | title = Works | volume = 21 | page = 27 | url = https://books.google.de/books?id=jGN4BAAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PT24&amp;dq=харьковское+наместничество&amp;hl=en&amp;pg=PT26#v=onepage&amp;q=%D0%A5%D0%B0%D1%80%D1%8C%D0%BA%D0%BE%D0%B2%D1%81%D0%BA%D0%BE%D0%B5%20%D0%9D%D0%B0%D0%BC%D0%B5%D1%81%D1%82%D0%BD%D0%B8%D1%87%D0%B5%D1%81%D1%82%D0%B2%D0%BE&amp;f=false | language = Russian}} St. Petersburg, 1901, First publication: 1865&lt;/ref&gt; Saint Petersburg replaced the regimental administrations with Russian [[hussar]] regiments,&lt;ref name=KUW231114/&gt; and granted Cossack higher ranks (''[[starshina]]s'') officership and nobility (''[[dvoryanstvo]]'').

In 1835 the province of Sloboda Ukraine was abolished, ceding most of its territory to the new [[Kharkov Governorate]], and some to [[Voronezh]] and [[Kursk]], which came under the [[Little Russia]]n [[Governorate General|General Governorship]] of [[Left-bank Ukraine]].&lt;ref name=KUW231114/&gt;

'''Subdivisions of Libya''' have varied significantly over the last two centuries. Initially [[Libya]] under [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] and [[Italian Empire|Italian]] control was organized into three to four provinces, then into three governorates (''[[muhafazah]]'') and after [[World War II]] into twenty-five districts (''[[baladiyah]]''). Successively into thirty-two districts (''[[Shabiyah|shabiyat]]'') with three administrative regions, and then into twenty-two districts (''shabiyat''). In 2012 the ruling [[General National Congress]]  divided the country into governorates (''muhafazat'') and districts (''baladiyat'').&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title= للقانون رقم 59 لسنة 2012 ميلادية بشأن نظام الإدارة المحلية |trans-title=Law No. 59 for the year 2012 AD on the local administration system |language=ar |publisher= اللجنة المركزية لانتخاب المجالس البلدية [The Central Committee for the election of baladiyah councils] |url=http://ccmce.ly/web/images/pdf/1/59.pdf |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140327121051/http://ccmce.ly/web/images/pdf/1/59.pdf |archivedate=27 March 2014 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|author=Bader, Mahmoud |title=Is Local Government in Libya the Solution? |date=April 2014 |publisher=Center for International Private Enterprise (CIPE) |url=http://www.cipe.org/blog/2014/04/04/is-local-government-in-libya-the-solution/ |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140717051705/http://www.cipe.org/blog/2014/04/04/is-local-government-in-libya-the-solution/ |archivedate=17 July 2014 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;  While the districts have been created,&lt;ref name="Balaiyat-A"&gt;{{Cite web |title=قرار مجلس الوزراء رقم 180 لسنة 2013 ميلادي بإنشاء البلديات |trans-title=Council of Ministers resolution No. 180 for the year 2013 AD the establishment of baladiyat |language=ar |publisher=اللجنة المركزية لانتخاب المجالس البلدية [The Central Committee for the election of baladiyah councils] |url=http://www.ccmce.ly/pdf/2/180_2.pdf |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140326232441/http://www.ccmce.ly/pdf/2/180_2.pdf |archivedate=26 March 2014 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; the governorates have not.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|author=Shanks, Tracy and Chemonics International Inc. |title=Libya Public Financial Management System Reform |date=3 July 2014 |publisher=Asia Middle East Economic Growth Best Practices Project (AMEG) |pages=5–6 |url=http://www.amegproject.org/sites/default/files/AMEG_Libya_PFM_II_Report_final.pdf |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151224045639/http://www.amegproject.org/sites/default/files/AMEG_Libya_PFM_II_Report_final.pdf |archivedate=December 24, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=Vandewalle, Dirk |year=2015 |chapter=Libya's Uncertain Revolution |editor=Cole, Peter |editor2=McQuin, Brian |title=The Libyan Revolution and its Aftermath |location=Oxford, England |publisher=Oxford University Press |page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=VRQoBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT35 35] |isbn=978-0-19-025733-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Prior to the [[Italo-Turkish War|Italian invasion of 1911]], the area of Libya was administered as three separate provinces ("Vilayets") of the [[Ottoman Empire]]: [[Tripolitania]], [[Fezzan]], and [[Cyrenaica]].

At first, [[Italy]] continued the tripartite administration, but soon consolidated the area into a single province/gobernatorate administered as the "[[History of Libya as Italian colony|Libyan Colony]]".  Indeed, until about 1931 -when the last of the native resistance to the Italians was subdued- the area was divided into three historical regions ([[Italian Tripolitania|Tripolitania]], [[Italian Cyrenaica|Cyrenaica]] and Fezzan/"Territorio Sahara").

Then, in 1937, Italian governor [[Italo Balbo]] created the political entity called ''Libya''. His [[Italian Libya]] was with four provinces and one territory: [[Tripoli Province|Tripoli]], [[Misurata (Italian Libya province)|Misurata]], [[Benghazi Province|Benghazi]], [[Derna (Italian Libya province)|Derna]], (in the coastal north) and the "[[Territorio Militare del Sud Libico|Territory of the Libyan Sahara]]" (in the Saharan south).&lt;ref&gt;Pan, Chia-Lin (1949) "The Population of Libya" ''Population Studies,'' 3(1):  pp. 100-125, p. 104&lt;/ref&gt;

After the French and British occupied Libya in 1943, it was again split into three provinces: [[Tripolitania]] in the northwest, [[Cyrenaica]] in the east, and [[Fezzan-Ghadames]] in the southwest.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zum.de/whkmla/histatlas/northafrica/libya19431951.gif "Map of Libya 1943-1951" ''Zentrale für Unterrichtsmedien'']&lt;/ref&gt;

After independence, Libya was divided into three [[Governorates of Libya|governorates]] (''[[muhafazah|muhafazat]]''), matching the three provinces of before, but in 1963 it was divided into ten governorates.

==Provinces==
{{main|Provinces of Libya}}
The Provinces of Libya existed during the last period of colonial Italian Libya through post-independence Libya. The country was divided into provinces from 1934 in the colonial era to 1963 when the [[Governorates of Libya|Governorates system]] was instituted.

==Governorates==
{{main|Governorates of Libya}}
The Governorates of Libya ([[muhafazah]]) were an administrative division of Libya from 1963 until 1983. Initially there were 46 governorates-districts, called [[baladiyah]], that were reduced to 25 in 1987.

==Baladiyat==
{{main|Baladiyat of Libya}}
In 1983, a new system was introduced dividing the country into forty-six districts (''[[baladiyat]]'' also sometimes translated as municipalities). In 1987 this number was reduced to twenty-five.

==Districts==
{{main|Districts of Libya}}
On 2 August 1995, Libya reorganized into thirteen districts (''sha`biyat'' - singular ''sha`biyah'', also translated as municipalities or popularates). In 1998 this was increased to twenty-six districts (sha`biyat). In 2001 it was increased to thirty-two districts plus three administrative regions.  Finally in 2007 the number was reduced to twenty-two districts.&lt;ref name="GPCO-shabiya"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://gpco.gov.ly/online/shabyat.php |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-05-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090207003234/http://gpco.gov.ly/online/shabyat.php |archivedate=2009-02-07 |df= }} ''شعبيات الجماهيرية العظمى''{{spaced ndash}}Sha'biyat of Great Jamahiriya, accessed July 6, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

===Basic People's Congresses===
{{main|Basic People's Congress (country subdivision)}}
Under [[Gaddafi]] Libyan districts were further subdivided into Basic People's Congresses {{lang-ar|مؤتمر شعبي أساسي}} (Mu'tamar shaʿbi asāsi ).  Geographically they corresponded approximately to the level of a [[township]] or [[borough]].  In desert areas they often had an extensive land area with very low population, and were generally centered on, and named for, an oasis.

'''Zhou Daguan''' ({{zh|w='''''Chou Ta-kuan'''''}}; [[French language|French]]: '''Tcheou Ta-Kouan'''; c. 1270–?)  was a Chinese diplomat under the [[Temür Khan, Emperor Chengzong of Yuan]].

However, his stay is notable because he later wrote a detailed report on life in Angkor, ''[[The Customs of Cambodia]]'' ({{zh|c=真臘風土記}}) . His portrayal is today one of the most important sources of understanding of historical Angkor and the [[Khmer Empire]]. Alongside descriptions of several great temples, such as the [[Bayon]], the [[Baphuon]], [[Angkor Wat]], and others, the text also offers valuable information on the everyday life and the habits of the inhabitants of Angkor.

==Biography==
Zhou was a native of [[Yongjia County|Yongjia]], a name often used in Zhou's time for [[Wenzhou]].  He had also been referred to as Zhou Jianguan (周建觀) and Zhou Dake (周達可) in other works.   He used the [[Art name|assumed name]] of Thatched Courtyard Recluse (Cao ting yimin, 草庭逸民) in his later life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=rs4IBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT16&amp;lpg=PT16&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=cao&amp;f=false |author=Zhou Daguan|title= A Record of Cambodia |translator= Peter Harris |publisher=University of Washington Press |year= 2007 |isbn=978-9749511244 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Diplomatic mission to Cambodia===
Zhou was part of an official delegation sent by Yuan Dynasty [[Temür Khan]] in 1296, although official Chinese records made no mention of his mission.  On 20 February 1296, Zhou Daguan set sail from Mingzhou (明州, today's [[Ningbo]]) in Zhejiang province, on a compass guided ship, passing the ports of [[Fuzhou]], [[Guangzhou]], [[Quanzhou]] (Zaitong), the Island of [[Hainan]], the Seven-Islands Sea (Qizhou yang), the sea off Central Vietnam coast (Jiaozhi Sea), and stopped over in Zhancheng or Champa (today's [[Qui Nhon]]). The ship resumed its trip past the province of Zhenpu ([[Bà Rịa]] in present-day southeastern Vietnam), through [[Poulo Condor]] Sea, then heading north on the [[Mekong River]] into [[Tonle Sap River]] reaching the town of [[Kampong Chhnang (city)|Kampong Chhnang]] of Cambodia; from there he boarded a small boat, sailing for a dozen days, through  [[Tonle Sap|Tonle Sap Lake]] arriving at [[Yaśodharapura]] ([[Angkor Thom]]), the capital of Cambodia in August.

As part of the diplomatic mission, Zhou was given access to the Royal Palace, although the not to the inner palace. He described the palaces and temples, along with  the buildings in and around the city.  He observed the parades and ceremonies as well as the daily life of the people, and he also travelled outside the capital to the countryside.  For much of his stay in Cambodia, he lived in a house near the north gate of Angkor Thom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=H1c1UIEVH9gC&amp;pg=PA414#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Encyclopedia of Ancient Asian Civilizations |author= Charles Higham |page=414 |publisher=Chelsea House Publishers |isbn=9781438109961 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Zhou stayed in Cambodia for eleven months, and left in July 1297.  He wrote the book ''The Customs of Cambodia'' within 15 years of his return, although the exact date of the book's completion is uncertain. Little is known of his life after his return, but he may have lived until the 1350s.&lt;ref name="harris"/&gt;

==''The Customs of Cambodia''==
{{main article|The Customs of Cambodia}}
The book ''The Customs of Cambodia'' was written within 15 years of Zhou's return from Cambodia. The current surviving text is believed to be only around a third of the size of the original.

===Description of Angkor Thom===
Zhou wrote that the city had five gates with multiple doorways, one in each compass direction, but in the east two. The city was surrounded by a wide moat crossed by bridges with sculptures of 54 figures pulling a nine-head [[nāga]]. On top of the city gate there were five Buddha heads, four of them facing four directions, the one at the centre was covered with gold. "The city is square in shape at each corner; the city gates are guarded, open during the day but closed at night. Dogs and convicts are barred from entering the city".

===Description of the palace===
Zhou wrote that the Palace was at the north of the golden bridge and the golden tower, and the Palace faced east. The main hall of the Palace was covered with lead tiles, while the rest had clay tiles.

===Description of the Khmer people===
Zhou observed that both men and women kept their chests exposed, walked barefoot, and wore only a piece of cloth wrapped around their waists. The common women had no hair ornaments, though some wore golden rings or bracelets. Beautiful women were sent to court to serve the king or his royal family at his whim. All trades were carried out by women. In the market place, there were no buildings, but rather the female vendors sold their wares on large mats spread about ground.  The space in the market also required a rent to be paid to the officials. He saw the [[Khmer people|Khmer]] people needed no tables or chairs in their homes, no recognisable bowls or buckets. They cooked their food in earthen pots used for boiling [[rice]] and for preparing soup. Their ladles were made from coconut shells and soup was then served into a tiny bowl made from woven leaves, which were made waterproof.

He recounted a royal procession of [[Indravarman III]] who wielded a sacred sword in his hand:

{{cquote|''When the king goes out, troops lead the escort; then come flags, banners and music. Palace women, numbering from three to five hundred, wearing clothes decorated with flowers, with flowers in their hair, hold candles in their hands, and form a troupe. Even in broad daylight, the candles are lit. Then come other palace women, carrying lances and shields; then the king's private guards; then carts drawn by goats and horses, all in gold. Afterwards ministers and princes mounted on elephants, and in front of them one can see, even from afar, their numerous red umbrellas. Next the wives and concubines of the king appear in palanquins, carriages, on horseback and on elephants. They have more than one hundred parasols, speckled with gold. Finally the sovereign arrives, standing on an elephant, brandishing his sacred sword in his hand. His elephant's tusks are encased in gold.''}}

===Translations===

Zhou's book was first translated into French by the [[sinologist]] [[Jean-Pierre Abel-Rémusat]] in 1819,&lt;ref&gt;[[Jean-Pierre Abel-Rémusat]]: Description du royaume de Cambodge par un voyageur chinois qui a visité cette contrée à la fin du XIII siècle, précédée d'une notice chronologique sur ce même pays, extraite des annales de la Chine, Imprimerie de J. Smith, 1819&lt;/ref&gt; and again by [[Paul Pelliot]] in 1902.&lt;ref&gt;[[Paul Pelliot]]: Mémoires sur les coutumes du Cambodge de Tcheou Ta-Kouan&lt;/ref&gt; The Pelliot translation, which was later revised, has been translated into English and German.&lt;ref&gt;Chou Ta-Kuan, The Customs of Cambodia, transl. by John Gilman d'Arcy Paul, Bangkok: Social Science Association Press, 1967.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Zhou Daguan, The Customs of Cambodia, transl. by Michael Smithies, Bangkok: The Siam Society, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Zhou Daguan, Sitten in Kambodscha. Leben und Alltag in Angkor im 13. Jahrhundert, Phnom Penh: Indochina Books, 6th edition 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Chou Ta-Kuan: Sitten in Kambodscha. Über das Leben in Angkor im 13. Jahrhundert. Keller und Yamada, Frankfurt: Angkor Verlag, 2nd edition 2006. {{ISBN|978-3-936018-42-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2007, the linguist Peter Harris completed the first direct translation from Chinese to modern English.  Harris also draws a series of parallels between the voyage of Zhou and the travels of [[Marco Polo]]. Marco Polo was Zhou's contemporary, however, according to Harris, Polo's travels contain a number of unusual omissions that have yet to be fully explained.&lt;ref name="harris"&gt;{{cite book |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=rs4IBAAAQBAJ |author=Zhou Daguan|title= A Record of Cambodia |translator= Peter Harris |publisher=University of Washington Press |year= 2007 |isbn=978-9749511244 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other translation of Zhou's record on Cambodia are also available. A direct translation from an ancient Chinese text into English by a native Chinese (Mrs. Beling Uk) and a native Cambodian (Solang Uk) in 2010. A Cambodian version of the translation by the same authors was published in Phnom-Penh in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amazon.de/dp/0755213068/ Zhou Daguan, A Record of Cambodia's Land and Customs, transl. by Solang and Beling Uk, Sandy (Beds., England): Authors OnLine, 2010.] {{ISBN|978-0-7552-1306-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;
