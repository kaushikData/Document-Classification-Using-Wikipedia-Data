The '''2018 AFF Championship''' is the 12th edition of the [[AFF Championship]], the [[Association football|football]] championship of nations affiliated to the [[ASEAN Football Federation]] (AFF), and the 6th under the name '''AFF Suzuki Cup'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sportspromedia.com/news/aff-suzuki-cup-title-sponsor|title=Suzuki returns as AFF Championship title sponsor|publisher=Sports Pro Media|date=9 February 2018|accessdate=9 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The final tournament runs from 8 November and is scheduled to end on 15 December 2018.&lt;ref name=format&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aseanfootball.org/v3/new-format-aff-suzuki-cup-2018/|title=New format for AFF Suzuki Cup 2018|publisher=ASEAN Football Federation|date=23 September 2017|accessdate=24 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The defending champions are [[Thailand national football team|Thailand]].

==Format==
In March 2016, it was reported that the AFF was mulling over changes to the tournament format due to the failure to attract big crowds for matches not involving the host nation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://footballchannel.asia/2016/03/11/post9888/|title=AFF proposes Suzuki Cup format changes|publisher=Football Channel Asia|date=11 March 2016|accessdate=12 December 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161224211126/http://footballchannel.asia/2016/03/11/post9888/|archivedate=24 December 2016|deadurl=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was then confirmed by the AFF that starting with the 2018 edition, a new format would be applied.  The nine highest ranked teams would automatically qualify with the 10th and 11th ranked teams playing in a two-legged qualifier.  The 10 teams would be split in two groups of five and play a round robin system with each team playing two home and two away fixtures.  A draw will be made to determine where the teams play while the format of the knockout round would remain unchanged.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://footballchannel.asia/2016/03/14/post9944/|title=New format confirmed for AFF Suzuki Cup|publisher=Football Channel Asia|date=14 March 2016|accessdate=12 December 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160314061516/http://footballchannel.asia/2016/03/14/post9944/|archivedate=14 March 2016|deadurl=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nine teams are automatically qualified in the AFF Championship final tournament. Based on the [[2016 AFF Championship]] ranking, Brunei and Timor Leste played in a home and away play offs which was be conducted on 1 and 8 September 2018 with the latter securing qualification.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/2018-09/09/c_137454906.htm|title=Timor-Leste through to AFF Championship group stage after 3-2 win over Brunei|author=Huaxia|publisher=Xinhua News Agency|date=9 September 2018|accessdate=9 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Australia national soccer team|Australia]], a member since 2013, did not enter the tournament.&lt;ref name=format/&gt;

[[File:2018 AFF Suzuki Cup color scheme.svg|thumb|150px|AFF Suzuki Cup colour scheme.&lt;ref name=unveilslook/&gt;]]
New tournament visuals, including a logo, for the AFF Championship was unveiled for the 2018 edition during the official draw held on 2 May 2018. The ASEAN Football Federation cooperated with Lagardère Sports for the tournament's branding. Five attributes were identified that are "synonymous" to the tournament. Elements combined to form the logo are a beating heart, a goalpost and raised hands by a fan that is meant to signify "pride, loyalty, football, rivalry, and passion".&lt;ref name="unveilslook"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.affsuzukicup.com/2018/news/media-releases/495-southeast-asia-s-most-watched-football-tournament-aff-suzuki-cup-unveils-progressive-new-look||title=Southeast Asia's Most Watched Football Tournament AFF Suzuki Cup Unveils Progressive New Look|publisher=2018 AFF Suzuki Cup|date=2 May 2018|accessdate=2 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition a colour scheme was developed for the branding. The colours devised are magenta (passion and energy), cyan (fresh beginning), green (vibrancy of a football pitch) and blue (topography of the region).&lt;ref name="unveilslook"/&gt;

==Incidents and controversies==

The hosts also need to take responsibility for the spectators’ safety. If this keeps happening in an host country, it will affect the AFF’s integrity. No one (the visitor team supporters) will come and watch the matches in the future.

The '''Festival International d'Art Lyrique d'Aix-en-Provence''' is an annual international [[music festival]] which takes place each summer in [[Aix-en-Provence]], principally in the month of July. Devoted mainly to [[opera]], it also includes concerts of orchestral, chamber, vocal and solo instrumental music.

==Establishment==
The first festival took place in July 1948. It was founded by Countess [[Lily Pastré]], who covered the entire costs in 1948.&lt;ref name="culture13salon"&gt;[http://www.culture-13.fr/agenda/le-salon-de-lily-hommage-a-la-comtesse-pastre-mecene.html Le Salon de Lily, Hommage à la Comtesse Pastré, mécène] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141216013330/http://www.culture-13.fr/agenda/le-salon-de-lily-hommage-a-la-comtesse-pastre-mecene.html |date=2014-12-16 }}, Culture 13&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="culture13parle"&gt;[http://www.culture-13.fr/agenda/edmonde-charles-roux-parle-de-la-comtesse-lily-pastre.html Edmonde Charles-Roux parle de la Comtesse Lily Pastré] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141007120050/http://www.culture-13.fr/agenda/edmonde-charles-roux-parle-de-la-comtesse-lily-pastre.html |date=2014-10-07 }}, Culture 13&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="lacroix"&gt;[http://www.la-croix.com/Culture/Expositions/Lily-Pastre-mecene-eclaire-et-ame-genereuse-2013-08-04-994666 Lily Pastré, mécène éclairé et âme généreuse], ''[[La Croix]]'', 4/8/13&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="lamarseillaise"&gt;David Coquille, [https://archive.is/20140925114028/http://www.lamarseillaise.fr/marseille/societe/27889-lily-pastre-du-vermouth-pour-un-conte-de-fee Lily Pastré, du vermouth pour un conte de fée], ''La Marsellaise'', April 07, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; It was made up of three or four concerts in the cour de l'Archevêché, a concert in the [[Cathédrale Saint-Sauveur d'Aix|Saint-Sauveur cathedral]], and six further concerts and recitals in various locations throughout the town. An opera was added to these concerts, [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]]'s ''[[Così fan tutte]]'', a work practically unknown by the French public at the time. However, it was not until 1949 that the festival became a success with its production of ''[[Don Giovanni]]''.

From inception until 1974, the festival was directed by [[Gabriel Dussurget]] who devoted much attention to the artistic and detailed aspects of the productions, which in turn attracted much attention to the festival.

In 1970, [[Mstislav Rostropovich]] premiered [[Henri Dutilleux]]'s [[Tout un monde lointain...]], now considered as one of the most important additions to the cello repertoire of the 20th century,&lt;ref name="AllmusicGuide"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/composition/tout-un-monde-lointain---concerto-for-cello-orchestra-mc0002357037|title=Tout un monde lointain. . ., concerto for cello &amp; orchestra|publisher=Allmusic.com|accessdate=17 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; at the festival.

Under the direction of [[Bernard Lefort]] from 1974 to 1982, the Festival became devoted to [[bel canto]] opera and, in general, a celebration of the voice. Performances of 19th century operas by [[Giuseppe Verdi|Verdi]] and [[Gaetano Donizetti|Donizetti]] were given by the reigning stars of bel canto such as [[Montserrat Caballé]], [[José Carreras]], [[Marilyn Horne]], and [[Katia Ricciarelli]], and the Festival spread throughout the town.

From 1982, a broadening of the repertoire to include baroque to modern operas ([[Benjamin Britten|Britten]] and [[Sergei Prokofiev|Prokofiev]], in particular) characterized the era of director [[Louis Erlo]], who gave preference to Mozart by staging new productions of his most famous works, but also the early operas written in the composer's youth.

In 1998 [[Stéphane Lissner]] took over the Festival, accomplishing a complete renovation of the [[Théâtre de l'Archevêché]] and thus making it the heart of the Festival. New operas were commissioned, most recently the 2005 production of ''[[Julie (opera)|Julie]]'' by the Belgian composer [[Philippe Boesmans]], based on [[August Strindberg|Strindberg]]'s ''[[Miss Julie]].''

In 2006, it featured concerts and operas as well as master classes. These included [[Richard Wagner|Wagner]]'s ''[[Das Rheingold]]'' conducted by Sir [[Simon Rattle]] with Sir [[Willard White]] as [[Odin#Modern age|Wotan]]; Mozart's ''[[The Magic Flute]]'', conducted by [[Daniel Harding]]; [[Gioacchino Rossini|Rossini]]'s ''[[L'italiana in Algeri|The Italian Girl in Algiers]]''; the [[Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra|Berlin Philharmonic]] playing [[Gustav Mahler|Mahler]]'s [[Symphony No. 5 (Mahler)|5th Symphony]]; and [[Pierre Boulez]], conducting and on the piano and works by [[Henry Purcell]].

Performances are given in a variety of locations, including:

*the Théâtre de l'Archevêché, in the courtyard of the former archbishop's palace
*the Grand Théâtre de Provence, opened in 2007
*the Jeu de Paumes, a restored 18th century theatre
*the courtyard of the Hôtel Maynier d'Oppède
*the Théâtre du Grand Saint-Jean, in the grounds of a chateau near Aix

The '''Bayview Opera House''', formerly known as''' South San Francisco Opera House''', is a theatre at 4705 3rd Street in [[Bayview-Hunters Point]] district,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Brooks|first=Jack|title=Front row center: a guide to northern California theatres|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SPDbozS_cEoC|date=October 1981|publisher=101 Productions|isbn=978-0-89286-193-4|page=96}}&lt;/ref&gt; San Francisco. 
Founded in 1888, it is reputed to be the oldest existing theatre in the city. It became a listed City of San Francisco landmark on October 28, 1968, and on March 21, 2011 it was listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]]. From 2014 to 2016, the theatre underwent renovation.

==History==
The theatre is reputed to be the oldest theatre in San Francisco,&lt;ref name="Weitz"/&gt; established in 1888.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Naylor|first1=David|last2=Dillon|first2=Joan|title=American Theaters: Performance Halls of the Nineteenth Century|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jWJJAQAAIAAJ|year=2006|publisher=Schiffer Pub.|isbn=978-0-7643-2491-8|page=132}}&lt;/ref&gt; It survived the [[1906 San Francisco earthquake]]. A Masonic Hall was formerly situated in the lot to the west of the main opera house, but the hall was demolished in 1975 and was replaced with an open-air entrance porch on the west side of the opera house. For many years the hall functioned as a community centre for gatherings and cultural events, and also hosted fairs and political rallies. The Opera House became a listed City of San Francisco landmark on October 28, 1968, and on March 21, 2011 it was listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nps.gov/nr/feature/presmonth/2011/South_San_Francisco_Opera_House.htm|title=South San Francisco Opera House|publisher=National Park Service|date=21 March 2016|accessdate=20 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Music===
Music was used from the popular Canadian post-rock band [[Godspeed You! Black Emperor]].  The band allowed songs from ''[[Yanqui U.X.O.]]'' to be used, stating that while they didn't normally allow their music to be used in films, they could align with the social nature of the film.

==Purpose==
This film project documents the effects of [[UXO]]* on Cambodian people, both within their homeland and in the US. In particular, Bombhunters documents villagers efforts throughout rural Cambodia as they seek out UXO and attempt to render it safe for sale to the scrap metal industry in order to survive.&lt;ref name="RA"/&gt;

==Release==
When the film had its premiere in November 2005 in [[Portland Oregon]].&lt;ref name="EO1"/&gt;  This film has been showcased in many film festivals across the globe including; [[Hot Springs Documentary Film Festival]], [[Rhode Island International Film Festival]], [[Palm Beach International Film Festival]],&lt;ref&gt;

'''Charles W. Sweeney''' (December 27, 1919 – July 16, 2004) was an officer in the [[United States Army Air Forces]] during [[World War II]] and the [[Aviator|pilot]] who flew [[Bockscar]] carrying the [[Fat Man]] [[atomic bomb]] to [[Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|the Japanese city of Nagasaki]] on August 9, 1945.  Separating from active duty at the end of World War II, he later became an officer in the [[Massachusetts Air National Guard]] as the Army Air Forces transitioned to an independent [[U.S. Air Force]], eventually rising to the rank of major general.

==Military career==
===509th Composite Group===
Sweeney became an instructor in the atomic missions training project, [[Project Alberta]], at [[Wendover Air Force Base|Wendover Army Airfield]], [[Utah]]. Selected to be part of the [[509th Operations Group|509th Composite Group]] commanded by Col. [[Paul Tibbets]], he was named commander of the [[320th Troop Carrier Squadron]] on 6 January 1945. Initially his squadron used [[C-47 Skytrain]] and [[C-46 Commando]] transports on hand to conduct the [[top secret]] operations to supply the 509th, but in April 1945 it acquired five [[C-54 Skymaster]]s, which had the range to deliver personnel and materiel to the western Pacific area.

On May 4, 1945, Sweeney became commander of the [[393d Bomb Squadron|393d Bombardment Squadron, Heavy]], the combat element of the 509th, in charge of 15 [[Silverplate]] B-29s and their flight and ground crews, 535 men in all. In June and July Sweeney moved his unit to North Field on the island of [[Tinian]] in the [[Mariana Islands|Marianas]].

In addition to supervising the intensive training of his flight crews during July 1945, Sweeney was slated to command the second atomic bomb mission. He trained with the crew of Captain [[Charles Donald Albury|(Charles D.) Don Albury]] aboard their B-29 ''[[The Great Artiste]]'', and was aircraft commander on the training mission of July 11. He and the crew flew five of the nine rehearsal test drops of inert [[Little Boy]] and [[Fat Man]] bomb assemblies in preparation for the missions.

On 6 August 1945, Sweeney and Albury piloted ''The Great Artiste'' as the instrumentation and observation support aircraft for the [[Atomic bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|atomic bomb attack on Hiroshima]].

===The Nagasaki Mission===
[[File:Fat man.jpg|thumb|A replica of the [[Fat Man]] bomb]]
On 9 August 1945, Major Sweeney commanded ''[[Bockscar]]'', which carried the atomic bomb ''[[Fat Man]]'' from the island of [[Tinian]] to Nagasaki. In addition to ''Bockscar'', the mission included two observation and instrumentation support B-29s, ''The Great Artiste'' and ''The Big Stink'', who would rendezvous with ''Bockscar'' over [[Yakushima Island]]. At the mission pre-briefing, the three planes were ordered to make their rendezvous over Yakushima at 30,000 feet due to weather conditions over [[Iwo Jima]] (the Hiroshima mission rendezvous). That same morning, on the day of the mission, the ground crew notified Sweeney that a faulty fuel transfer pump made it impossible to utilize some 625 gallons of fuel in the tail, but Sweeney, as aircraft commander, elected to proceed with the mission.&lt;ref&gt;Polmar, Norman, ''The Enola Gay: the B-29 that dropped the Atomic Bomb on Hiroshima'', Washington, D.C.: The Smithsonian Institution, (2004), p. 35&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Miller, Donald, ''The Story of World War II'', New York: Simon &amp; Schuster, {{ISBN|978-0-7432-1198-7}}, {{ISBN|0-7432-1198-7}}, p. 630&lt;/ref&gt;

Before takeoff, Col. Tibbets warned Sweeney that he had lost at least 45 minutes of flying time because of the fuel pump problem, and to take no more than fifteen minutes at the rendezvous before proceeding directly to the primary target.&lt;ref&gt;Miller, Donald, pp. 630-631: Tibbets stated that he told Sweeney to "go to your rendezvous point and tell the other planes the same thing I told you at Iwo Jima [the Hiroshima mission rendezvous]: 'Make one 360-degree turn, be on my wing, or I'm going to the target anyway.'"&lt;/ref&gt;

After takeoff from Tinian, ''Bockscar'' reached its rendezvous point and after circling for an extended period, found ''The Great Artiste'', but not ''The Big Stink''.&lt;ref&gt;Miller, Donald, p. 631&lt;/ref&gt;  Climbing to 30,000 feet, the assigned rendezvous altitude, both aircraft slowly circled Yakushima Island. Though Sweeney had been ordered not to wait at the rendezvous for the other aircraft longer than fifteen minutes before proceeding to the primary target, Sweeney continued to wait for ''The Big Stink'', perhaps at the urging of Commander [[Frederick Ashworth]], the plane's weaponeer.&lt;ref&gt;Miller, Donald, pp. 630, 631: Tibbets noted that regardless of any advice he may have received, Sweeney was the aircraft commander, and remained responsible at all times for command of the aircraft and the mission.&lt;/ref&gt;  After exceeding the original rendezvous time limit by a half-hour, ''Bockscar'', accompanied by ''The Great Artiste'', proceeded to the primary target, [[Kokura]].&lt;ref&gt;Miller, Donald, pp. 631-632&lt;/ref&gt;  No fewer than three bomb runs were made, but the delay at the rendezvous had resulted in 7/10ths cloud cover over the primary target, and the bombardier was unable to drop.&lt;ref&gt;Miller, Donald P., pp. 630, 632-633: In making an unheard-of third bomb run with a $25-million-dollar atomic weapon, it appeared to others that Sweeney appeared determined not to abort the mission and return with ''Fat Man'', regardless of the risk to the aircraft or the flight crew.&lt;/ref&gt;  By the time of the third bomb run, Japanese antiaircraft fire was getting close, and Japanese fighter planes could be seen climbing to intercept ''Bockscar''.&lt;ref&gt;Miller, Donald, p. 633&lt;/ref&gt;

Poor bombing visibility and an increasingly critical fuel shortage eventually forced ''Bockscar'' to divert from Kokura and attack the secondary target, Nagasaki.&lt;ref&gt;Miller, Donald, p. 632&lt;/ref&gt; As they approached Nagasaki, the heart of the city's downtown was covered by dense cloud, and Sweeney and the plane's weaponeer, Commander Ashworth, initially decided to bomb Nagasaki using radar.&lt;ref&gt;Miller, Donald, p. 633-634&lt;/ref&gt; However, a small opening in the clouds allowed ''Bockscar's'' bombardier to verify the target as Nagasaki. As the crew had been ordered to drop the bomb visually if possible, Sweeney decided to proceed with a visual bomb run.&lt;ref&gt;Miller, Donald, pp. 634-635&lt;/ref&gt;  ''Bockscar'' then dropped ''Fat Man'', with a blast yield equivalent to 21 kilotons of [[Trinitrotoluene|TNT]]. It exploded 43 seconds later at {{convert|469|m|ft|abbr=off|sp=us|order=flip}} above the ground, at least {{convert|2.5|km|mi|abbr=off|sp=us|order=flip}} northwest of the planned aim point.&lt;ref&gt;Wainstock, Dennis D., ''The Decision to Drop the Atomic Bomb'', Praeger Publishing, {{ISBN|0-275-95475-7}} (1996), p. 92.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Miller, Donald P., pp. 626, 638&lt;/ref&gt; The failure to drop ''Fat Man'' at the precise bomb aim point caused the atomic blast to be confined to the Urakami Valley. As a consequence, a major portion of the city was protected by the intervening hills, and only 60% of Nagasaki was destroyed. The bombing also severed the Mitsubishi arms production extensively and killed an estimated 35,000-40,000 people outright, including 23,200-28,200 Japanese industrial workers, 2,000 Korean slave laborers, and 150 Japanese soldiers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Nuke-Rebuke: Writers &amp; Artists Against Nuclear Energy &amp; Weapons (The Contemporary anthology series) |pages=22–29 |date=May 1, 1984 |publisher=The Spirit That Moves Us Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Low on fuel, ''Bockscar'' barely made it to the runway on Okinawa. With only enough fuel for one landing attempt, Sweeney brought ''Bockscar'' in fast and hard, ordering every available distress flare on board to be fired as he did so.&lt;ref&gt;Walker, Stephen, ''Shockwave: Countdown to Hiroshima'', New York: HarperCollins (2005) pp. 13-14&lt;/ref&gt;  The number two engine died from [[fuel starvation]] as ''Bockscar'' began its final approach.&lt;ref name="Walker, Stephen, p. 14"&gt;Walker, Stephen, p. 14&lt;/ref&gt;  Touching the runway hard, the heavy B-29 slewed left and towards a row of parked B-24 bombers before the pilots managed to regain control.&lt;ref name="Walker, Stephen, p. 14"/&gt;  With both pilots standing on the brakes, Sweeney made a swerving 90-degree turn at the end of the runway to avoid going over the cliff into the ocean.&lt;ref&gt;Glines, C.V., ''World War II: The Second Atomic Bomb That Ended The War'', Aviation History (January 1997), pp. 36-37&lt;/ref&gt; 2nd Lt. [[Jacob Beser]] recalled that at this point, two engines had died from fuel exhaustion, while "the centrifugal force resulting from the turn was almost enough to put us through the side of the airplane."&lt;ref&gt;Glines, C.V., p. 37&lt;/ref&gt;

After ''Bockscar'' returned to Tinian, Col. Tibbets recorded that he was faced with the dilemma of considering “if any action should be taken against the airplane commander, Charles Sweeney, for failure to command.”&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Puttré, Michael, ''Nagasaki Revisited'', retrieved 8 April 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Tibbets, Paul W. 1998"&gt;Tibbets, Paul W. ''Return Of The Enola Gay'', Columbus, Ohio: Mid Coast Marketing (1998), {{ISBN|0-9703666-0-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Miller, Donald L. 2005 pp. 361-362"&gt;Miller, Donald L., ''D-days in the Pacific'', New York: Simon &amp; Schuster (2005), pp. 361-362&lt;/ref&gt;  After meeting on Guam with Col. Tibbets and Major Sweeney, General [[Curtis LeMay]], chief of staff for the Strategic Air Forces, confronted Sweeney, stating ''"You fucked up, didn't you, Chuck?"'', to which Sweeney made no reply.&lt;ref name="Miller, Donald L., pp. 361-362"&gt;Miller, Donald L., pp. 361-362&lt;/ref&gt;  LeMay then turned to Tibbets and told him that an investigation into Sweeney's conduct of the mission would serve no useful purpose.&lt;ref name="Miller, Donald L., pp. 361-362"/&gt;

In November 1945, Sweeney returned with the 509th Composite Group to [[Walker Air Force Base|Roswell Army Air Base]] in [[New Mexico]] to train aircrews for the atomic testing mission, [[Operation Crossroads]].

==Post-war activities==
Sweeney left active duty with the rank of [[lieutenant colonel]] on June 28, 1946, but remained active with the [[Massachusetts Air National Guard]]. Later promoted to full [[Colonel (United States)|colonel]], on February 21, 1956, Sweeney was named commander of its [[102nd Air Defense Wing]] and shortly after, on April 6, was promoted to [[Brigadier general (United States)|Brigadier General]]. During this time, he was activated with the 102nd and served in Europe during the [[Berlin Crisis of 1961|Berlin Crisis]] from October 1961 to August 1962. Sweeney was made Chief of Staff in October 1967.

He retired in 1976 as a [[Major general (United States)|major general]] in the [[Air National Guard]].&lt;ref name=WashPostObit&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A60638-2004Jul18.html Charles H. Sweeney; Led Bomb Drop Over Nagasaki (washingtonpost.com)&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;  He also appeared in the 1970s television series ''[[The World at War]]'' and was seen explaining the USAAF buildup to the mission raids.

Throughout his life Sweeney remained convinced of the appropriateness and necessity of the bombing. "I saw these beautiful young men who were being slaughtered by an evil, evil military force," he said in 1995. "There's no question in my mind that President Truman made the right decision." At the same time, he said, "As the man who commanded the last atomic mission, I pray that I retain that singular distinction."&lt;ref&gt;https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A60638-2004Jul18.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later life==
Near the end of his life, Sweeney wrote a controversial and factually disputed memoir of the atomic bombing and the 509th Composite Group, ''War's End: An Eyewitness Account of America's Last Atomic Mission''.&lt;ref&gt;Puttré, Michael, ''[http://www.mputtre.com/id45.html Nagasaki Revisited] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110610152653/http://www.mputtre.com/id45.html |date=2011-06-10 }}'', retrieved 8 April 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Coster-Mullen, John, ''Atom Bombs: The Top Secret Inside Story of Little Boy and Fat Man,'' publ. J. Coster-Mullen, End Notes, (2004): Gen. [[Paul Tibbets]], Major [[Dutch Van Kirk]] (Enola Gay's navigator), and other surviving members of the 509th Composite Group were reportedly outraged at many of the factual assertions by Sweeney in ''War's End''&lt;/ref&gt; In ''War's End'', Sweeney defended the decision to drop the atomic bomb in light of subsequent historical questioning. However, it was Sweeney's other assertions regarding the Nagasaki atomic mission, along with various anecdotes regarding the 509th and its crews that drew the most criticism. General [[Paul Tibbets]], Major [[Theodore Van Kirk|"Dutch" Van Kirk]], Colonel [[Thomas Ferebee]] and others vigorously disputed Sweeney's account of events.&lt;ref&gt;Coster-Mullen, John, ''Atom Bombs: The Top Secret Inside Story of Little Boy and Fat Man'', publ. J. Coster-Mullen, End Notes, (2004)&lt;/ref&gt;  Partly in response to ''War's End'', General Tibbets issued a revised version of his own autobiography in 1998, adding a new section on the Nagasaki attack in which he harshly criticized Sweeney’s actions during the mission.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Tibbets, Paul W. 1998"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Miller, Donald L. 2005 pp. 361-362"/&gt;

In his later years Charles Sweeney performed in various air shows doing many maneuvers to awe crowds. Sweeney died at age 84 on July 16, 2004 at [[Massachusetts General Hospital]] in [[Boston]].

A short documentary featuring an audio recording of Sweeney describing the Nagasaki mission preparation and execution called "Nagasaki: The Commander's Voice" was made in 2005. The 2002 audio recording was the last one made before his death.

'''Coextinction''' and '''cothreatened''' refer to the phenomena of the loss or decline of a host [[species]] resulting in the loss or endangerment of other species that depends on it, potentially leading to cascading effects across [[trophic level]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Jönsson | first1 = M. T. | last2 = Thor | first2 = G. | last3 = Roberts | first3 = D. L. | year = 2012 | title = Estimating Coextinction Risks from Epidemic Tree Death: Affiliate Lichen Communities among Diseased Host Tree Populations of Fraxinus excelsior | journal = PLOS ONE | volume = 7 | issue = 9| pages = 1–10 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0045701 | pmid=23049840 | pmc=3458109}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term originated by the authors Stork and Lyal (1993)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Turvey|first=Samuel T|title=Holocene Extinctions|date=May 28, 2009|publisher=Oxford University Press|page=167}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was originally used to explain the extinction of [[parasite|parasitic]] [[insects]] following the loss of their specific hosts. The term is now used to describe the loss of any [[biological interaction|interacting]] species, including competition with their counterpart, and specialist [[herbivore]]s with their food source.  Coextinction is especially common when a [[keystone species]] goes extinct.

==Causes==
The most frequently cited example is that of the extinct [[passenger pigeon]] and its parasitic [[Bird louse|bird lice]] ''[[Columbicola extinctus]]'' and ''Campanulotes defectus''. Recently, ''C. extinctus'' was rediscovered on the [[band-tailed pigeon]],&lt;ref name="Clayton1999"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Clayton |first=D. H. |first2=R. D. |last2=Price |year=1999 |title=Taxonomy of New World ''Columbicola'' (Phthiraptera: Philopteridae) from the Columbiformes (Aves), with descriptions of five new species |journal=Ann. Entomol. Soc. Am. |volume=92 |issue= 5|pages=675–685 |doi= 10.1093/aesa/92.5.675}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''C. defectus'' was found to be a likely case of misidentification of the existing ''[[Campanulotes flavus]]''.&lt;ref name="Price2000"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Price |first=R. D. |first2=D. H. |last2=Clayton |first3=R. J., Jr. |last3=Adams |year=2000 |title=Pigeon lice down under: Taxonomy of Australian ''Campanulotes'' (Phthiraptera: Philopteridae), with a description of ''C. durdeni'' n.sp. |journal=Journal of Parasitology |volume=86 |issue=5 |pages=948–950 |doi=10.1645/0022-3395(2000)086[0948:PLDUTO]2.0.CO;2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, even though the passenger pigeon louse was rediscovered, coextinctions of other parasites, even on the passenger pigeon, may have occurred. Several louse species—such as ''[[Rallicola extinctus]]'', a [[huia]] parasite—probably became extinct together with their hosts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Mey |first=E. |year=1990 |title=Eine neue ausgestorbene Vogel-Ischnozere von Neuseeland, ''Huiacola extinctus'' (Insecta, Phthiraptera) |journal=Zoologischer Anzeiger |volume=224 |issue=1/2 |pages=49–73 |doi= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Recent studies have suggested that up to 50% of species may go extinct in the next 50 years.&lt;ref name="Koh LP 1634"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Koh | first1 = LP | last2 = Dunn | first2 = RR | last3 = Sodhi | first3 = NS | last4 = Colwell | first4 = RK | last5 = Proctor | first5 = HC | last6 = Smith | first6 = VS | year = 2004 | title = Species coextinctions and the biodiversity crisis | url = | journal = Science | volume = 305 | issue = 5690| pages = 1632–1634 | doi = 10.1126/science.1101101 | pmid=15361627}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is in part due to coextinction; for example the loss of tropical butterfly species from Singapore is attributed to the loss of their specific larval host plants.&lt;ref name="Koh LP 1634"/&gt; To see how possible future cases of coextinction would play out, researchers have made models to show probabilistic relationships between affiliate and host extinctions across co-evolved inter-specific systems. The subjects are pollinating [[Ficus]] Wasps and Ficus, primate parasites, (Pneumocystis [[Fungi]], [[Nematode]], and [[Lice]]) and their hosts, parasitic mites and lice and their avian hosts, butterflies and their larval host plants, and ant butterflies and their host ants. For all but the most host-specific affiliate groups (e.g., primate Pneumocystis fungi and primates), affiliate extinction levels may be modest at low levels of host extinction but can be expected to rise quickly as host extinctions increase to levels predicted in the near future. This curvilinear relationship between host and affiliate extinction levels may also explain, in part, why so few coextinction events have been documented to date.&lt;ref name="Koh LP 1634"/&gt;

Investigations have been carried out into coextinction risk among the rich [[Psyllid]] fauna [[Hemiptera]] – Psylloidea inhabiting [[acacias]] (Fabaceae-Mimosoideae: Acacia) in central eastern New South Wales, Australia. The results, suggest that ''A. ausfeldii'' hosts one specialist psyllid species, Acizzia, and that ''A. gordonii'' hosts one specialist psyllid, Acizzia. Both psyllid species may be threatened at the same level of their host species with coextinction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | year = 2012 | title = Are psyllids affiliated with the threatened plants Acacia ausfeldii, A. dangarensis and A. gordonii at risk of co-extinction?. | url = | journal = Austral Ecology | volume = 37 | issue = 1| pages = 140–148 | doi = 10.1111/j.1442-9993.2011.02257.x | last1 = Powell | first1 = Fiona A. | last2 = Hochuli | first2 = Dieter F. | last3 = Symonds | first3 = Celia L. | last4 = Cassis | first4 = Gerasimos }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Interaction patterns can be used to anticipate the consequences of phylogenetic effects. By using a system of methodical observations, scientists can use the phylogenetic relationships of species to predict the number of interactions they exhibit in more than one-third of the networks, and the identity of the species with which they interact in about half of the networks. Consequentially, simulated extinction events tend to trigger coextinction cascades of related species. This results in a non-random pruning of the evolutionary tree.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rezende|first=Enrico|title=Non-random coextinctions in phylogenetically structured mutualistic networks|journal=Nature|date=23 August 2007|volume=448|series=925|issue=7156|doi=10.1038/nature05956|pmid=17713534|pages=925–8|display-authors=etal|hdl=10261/38513}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2004 paper in ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'', [[ecology|ecologist]] [[Lian Pin Koh]] and colleagues discuss coextinction,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Koh |first=Lian Pin |last2=Dunn |first2=Robert R. |last3=Sodhi |first3=Navjot S. |last4=Colwell |first4=Robert K. |last5=Proctor |first5=Heather C. |last6=Smith |first6=Vincent S. |year=2004 |title=Species Coextinctions and the Biodiversity Crisis |journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]] |volume=305 |issue=5690 |pages=1632–1634 |doi=10.1126/science.1101101 |pmid=15361627 }}&lt;/ref&gt; stating

&lt;blockquote&gt;"Species coextinction is a manifestation of the interconnectedness of organisms in complex [[ecosystem]]s. The loss of species through coextinction represents the loss of irreplaceable [[evolution]]ary and [[coevolution]]ary history. In view of the global extinction crisis, it is imperative that coextinction be the focus of future research to understand the intricate processes of species extinctions. While coextinction may not be the most important cause of species extinctions, it is certainly an insidious one." (Koh ''et al.'' 2004)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Koh ''et al.'' also define '''coendangered''' as [[taxon|taxa]] "likely to go extinct if their currently endangered hosts [...] become extinct."

One example is the near extinction of the genus ''[[Hibiscadelphus]]'' as a consequence of the disappearance of several of the [[Hawaiian honeycreeper]]s, its [[pollinator]]s. There are several instances of [[predator]]s and [[scavengers]] dying out following the disappearance of species which represented their source of food: for example, the coextinction of the [[Haast's eagle]] with the [[moa]].

Coextinction may also occur on a local level: for example, the decline in the red ant ''[[Myrmica sabuleti]]'' in southern [[England]], caused by habitat loss, resulted in the local extinction of the [[large blue]] butterfly, which is dependent on the ant as a host for the larvae. In this case the ant avoided local extinction, and the butterfly has been reintroduced.

Another example of species going through coextinction is the rhinoceros stomach bot fly (''Gyrostigma rhinocerontis'') and its host species the endangered [[black rhinoceros]] and [[white rhinoceros]] (''Diceros bicornis'' and ''Ceratotherium simum''). The fly's larvae mature in a rhinoceros's stomach lining, having entered the body via the digestive tract, and so are dependent on rhinoceros species to reproduce.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Colwell | first1 = DD | last2 = Otranto | first2 = D | last3 = Stevens | first3 = JR | year = 2009 | title = Oestrid flies: eradication and extinction versus biodiversity | url = | journal = Trends Parasitol | volume = 25 | issue = 11| pages = 500–4 | doi=10.1016/j.pt.2009.07.011| pmid = 19762281 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Consequences==
Coextinction can mean [[Biodiversity loss|loss of biodiversity]] and diversification. Coextinctions can influence not only parasite and mutualist diversification but also their hosts. Arguably, parasites facilitate host diversification through sexual selection.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}} That loss of parasites can reduce host diversification rates. Coextinction can also result in loss of evolutionary history. The extinction of related hosts can lead to the extinction of related parasites. The loss of history is likely to be greater than the loss expected, were species to go extinct at random.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}} Furthermore, if coextinctions are clustered, it is more likely that coextinction can produce non-random trait loss. Species that are at risk of coextinction are expected to be larger because rare hosts tend to be larger and larger hosts have larger parasites.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}} They can also be expected to have lengthy generation times or higher tropic positions. Coextinction can extend beyond biodiversity and has direct and indirect consequences from the communities of lost species. One main consequence of coextinction that goes beyond biodiversity is mutualism, by loss of food production with a decline in threatened pollinators. Losses of parasites can have negative impacts on humans or the species. In rare hosts, losses of specialist parasites can predispose hosts to infection by emergent parasites.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}} Furthermore, relating to the consequences of removing specialist parasites from rare hosts, is the problem of where the parasites will go once their host is extinct. If the parasites are dependent on only those species than there are parasite species that are at risk of extinction through co-endangerment. On the other hand, if they are able to find and switch onto alternative hosts, those hosts can turn out to be humans. Either way, the loss of parasites by co extinction or the acquiring of new parasites by alternative hosts, proves to be a major issue. Coextinction can go beyond the decreased biodiversity, it can range into various biomes and link various ecosystems.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}

A study conducted in [[New Caledonia]] has shown that extinction of a [[coral reef]]-associated fish species of average size would eventually result in the co-extinction of at least ten species of parasites.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal  | last1 = Justine | first1 = JL. | last2 = Beveridge | first2 = I. | last3 = Boxshall | first3 = GA. | last4 = Bray | first4 = RA. | last5 = Miller | first5 = TL. | last6 = Moravec | first6 = F. | last7 = Trilles | first7 = JP. | last8 = Whittington | first8 = ID. | title = An annotated list of fish parasites (Isopoda, Copepoda, Monogenea, Digenea, Cestoda, Nematoda) collected from Snappers and Bream (Lutjanidae, Nemipteridae, Caesionidae) in New Caledonia confirms high parasite biodiversity on coral reef fish. | journal = Aquat Biosyst | volume = 8 | issue = 1 | pages = 22 | year = 2012 | doi = 10.1186/2046-9063-8-22 | pmid = 22947621 | pmc = 3507714 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Risks ==
The host Specificity and Life Cycle is a major factor in the risk of coextinction. Species of mutalists, parasites, and many free-living insects that have staged life cycles are more likely to be a victim of coextinction. This is due to the fact that these organisms may depend on multiple hosts throughout their lives in comparison to simple life cycled organisms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Moir | first1 = ML | last2 = Vesk | first2 = PA | last3 = Brennan | first3 = KEC | last4 = Keith | first4 = DA | last5 = Hughes | first5 = L | last6 = McCarthy | first6 = MA | year = 2010 | title = Current constraints and future directions in estimating coextinction | url = | journal = Conserv. Biol. | volume = 24 | issue = 3| pages = 682–90 | doi=10.1111/j.1523-1739.2009.01398.x| pmid = 20067486 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, if organisms are evolutionary flexible, then these organisms may escape extinction.&lt;ref&gt;Bronstein JL, Dieckmann U, Ferrièrre R. 2004. Coevolutionary dynamics and the conservation of mutualisms. In Evolutionary Conservation Biology, ed. R Ferrièrre, U Dieckmann, D Couvet, pp. 305–26. Cambridge, UK: Cambridge Univ. Press&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Robert, Colwell K., Dunn R. Robert, and Nyeema C. Harris. "Coextinction and Persistence of Dependent Species in a Changing World." Annual Review of Ecology, Evolution, and Systematics 48 (n.d.): 183-203.&lt;/ref&gt;

The area with that has the greatest affect of coextinction is the tropics. There is a continued disappearance in the habitat, human intervention, and a great loss in vital [[ecosystem services]]. This is threatening because the tropics contain 2/3 of the all known species but they aren't in a situation where they can be fully taken care of. Along with forest loss other risk factors include: coastal development, overexploitation of wildlife, and habitat conversion, that also affect human well-being.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bradshaw | first1 = Corey JA | last2 = Sodhi | first2 = Navjot S | last3 = Brook | first3 = Barry W | year = 2009 | title = Tropical turmoil: a biodiversity tragedy in progress | url = | journal = Frontiers in Ecology and the Environment | volume = 7 | issue = 2| pages = 79–87 | doi=10.1890/070193}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an effort to find a stop to coextinction, researchers have found that the first step would be to conserve the host species in which other species are dependent on. These hosts serve as major components for their habitat and need them to survive. In deciding what host to protect, it is important to choose one that can benefit an array of other dependent species.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Moir | first1 = M.

The '''conquest of Mecca''' ({{lang-ar|فتح مكة }} ''{{transl|ar|ALA-LC|fatḥ makkah}}'') refers to the event when [[Mecca]] was conquered by Muslims led by  [[Muhammad]] in December 629 or January 630 AD,&lt;ref name="date"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite|title=Muhammad: Islam’s First Great General|first1=Richard A. |last1=Gabriel |pages=167, 176|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=0HQCBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PR4&amp;dq=Muhammad:+Islam’s+First+Great+General&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiC1LLB0-XdAhVlKcAKHW6OD3oQ6AEIKTAA#v=onepage&amp;q=11%20January&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;  ([[Julian calendar|Julian]]), 10-20 [[Ramadan (calendar month)|Ramadan]], 8 [[Islamic calendar|AH]].&lt;ref name="date"/&gt;

== Dates ==
Ancient sources vary as to the dates of these events.
*The date Muhammad set out for Mecca is variously given as 2, 6 or 10 Ramadan 8 AH.&lt;ref name="date"/&gt;
*The date Muhammad entered Mecca is variously given as 10, 17/18, 19 or 20 Ramadan 8 AH.&lt;ref name="date"/&gt;
The conversion of these dates to the Julian calendar depends on what assumptions are made about the calendar in use in Mecca at the time.  For example, 18 Ramadan 8 AH may be converted to 11 December 629 AD, 10 or 11 January 630, or 6 June 630 AD.&lt;ref name="date"/&gt;

==Background==
{{see|Muhammad in Mecca|Muhammad in Medina}}
In 628 the Meccan tribe of [[Quraysh]] and the Muslim community in [[Medina]] signed a 10 year truce called the [[Treaty of Hudaybiyyah]]. 

In 630, this truce was broken when the [[Banu Bakr ibn Abd Manat|Banu Bakr]], allies of the Quraysh, attacked the [[Banu Khuza'a]], who had recently become allies of the Muslims.

According to the terms of the Treaty of Hudaybiyyah, the Arab tribes were given the option of joining either of the sides, the Muslims or Quraysh. Should any of these tribes face aggression, the party to which it was allied would have the right to retaliate. As a consequence, [[Banu Bakr]] joined Quraysh, and Khuza'ah joined the Muslims. They thus lived in peace for some time; but ulterior motives stretching back to the pre-Islamic period, ignited by unabated fire of revenge, triggered fresh hostilities. Banu Bakr, without concern for the provisions of the treaty, attacked [[Banu Khuza'a]] in a place called Al-Wateer in Sha'ban, in 8 AH. Quraysh helped Banu Bakr with men and arms, taking advantage of the dark night. Pressed by their enemies, the tribesmen of Khuza'ah sought the Holy Sanctuary, but here too, their lives were not spared, and, contrary to all accepted traditions, Nawfal, the chief of Banu Bakr, chased them in the sanctified area — where no blood should be shed — and massacred his adversaries. Khuza'ah at once sent a delegation to Medina to inform [[Muhammad]], of this breach of truce and to seek help from Muslims of Medina being their allies.{{Citation needed|reason=this detailed summary needs proper citation(s)|date=August 2018}}

After the incident, Quraysh sent a delegation to Muhammad, petitioning to maintain the treaty with the Muslims and offering material compensation. The Muslim forces had gathered in strength to settle account with Quraysh and for the final attack and the opening of Mecca.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Peters|first=Francis E.|title=Muhammad and the Origins of Islam|year=1994|publisher=SUNY Press|isbn=978-0-7914-1875-8|page=235 &amp; 334|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=0OrCo4VyvGkC&amp;pg=PA235}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{Failed verification|date=August 2018}} &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lewis|first=Bernard|title=The Arabs in history|year=1967|publisher=Harper &amp; Row|isbn=978-0-06-131029-4|page=200|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_J2FAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA200}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{Failed verification|date=August 2018}}

==Entrance into Mecca==
{{Islamic prophets|Events}}
After [[Abu Sufyan ibn Harb]]'s departure, Muhammad immediately assembled a large army. The objective of the operation was kept secret and even Muhammad's close friends and commanders did not know his plans.   Muhammad intended to assemble and attack the Quraysh using the element of surprise. For further secrecy, Muhammad sent Abu Qatadah towards "Batan Izm" [[Military deception|to give the impression that he wanted to go there]].&lt;ref&gt;Seerah ibn Hisham p.&amp;nbsp;226/2,228.&lt;/ref&gt;{{better source|date=March 2016}}

The Muslim army set out for Mecca on Wednesday, 29 November 629 (6 Ramadan, 8&amp;nbsp;AH).&lt;ref name="date"&gt;F.R. Shaikh, ''Chronology of Prophetic Events'', Ta-Ha Publishers Ltd., London, 2001 pp 3, 72, 134-6&lt;/ref&gt;   Volunteers and contingents from allied tribes joined the Muslim army on the way swelling its size to about 10,000 strong. This was the largest Muslim force ever assembled as of that time. The army stayed at Marr-uz-Zahran, located ten miles northwest of Mecca.  Muhammad ordered every man to light a fire so as to make the Meccans overestimate the size of the army.&lt;ref name="Akram 2007, p. 61"&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/KhalidBinAl-waleedSwordOfAllah.pdf/KhalidBinAl-waleedSwordOfAllah#page/n61/mode/2up/search/column Akram 2007, p. 61].&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, Abu Sufyan ibn Harb travelled back and forth between Muhammad and Mecca, still trying to reach a settlement in order to avoid conquest. According to the sources, he found assistance in Muhammad's uncle [[‘Abbas ibn ‘Abd al-Muttalib|Al-Abbas]], though some scholars{{who|date=December 2011}} consider that historians writing under the rule of Abbas' descendants, the [[Abbasid Caliphate|Abbasid Dynasty]], had exaggerated Abbas' role and downplayed the role of Abu Sufyan, who was the ancestor of the Abbaside's enemies.&lt;ref name="Glubb"&gt;John Glubb, ''The Life and Times of Muhammad'', Lanham, 1998, pp.&amp;nbsp;304–310.&lt;/ref&gt;

Mecca lies in the Valley of Ibrahim, surrounded by black rugged hills reaching heights of {{Convert|1000|ft|abbr=on}} at some places. There were four entry routes through passes in the hills. These were from the north-west, the south-west, the south, and the north-east. Muhammad divided the Muslim army into four columns: one to advance through each pass. The main column in which Muhammad was present was commanded by [[Abu Ubaidah ibn al-Jarrah]]. It was tasked to enter Mecca through the main Madina route, from the north-west near Azakhir. Muhammad's cousin [[Az Zubayr]] commanded the second column and it would enter Mecca from the south-west, through a pass west of Kuda hill. The column entering from the south through Kudai was under the leadership of Muhammad's cousin [[Ali]]. The last column under [[Khalid ibn al-Walid]] was tasked to enter from the north-east, through Khandama and Lait.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/KhalidBinAl-waleedSwordOfAllah.pdf/KhalidBinAl-waleedSwordOfAllah#page/n60/mode/2up/search/column Akram 2007, p. 60].&lt;/ref&gt;

Their tactic was to advance simultaneously from all sides targeting a single central objective. This would lead to [[Defeat in detail|the dispersion of enemy forces]] and prevent their concentration on any one front. Another important reason for this tactic was that even if one or two of the attacking columns faced stiff resistance and became unable to break through, then the attack could continue from other flanks. This would also prevent any of the Quresh from escaping.&lt;ref name="Akram 2007, p. 61"&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/KhalidBinAl-waleedSwordOfAllah.pdf/KhalidBinAl-waleedSwordOfAllah#page/n61/mode/2up/search/column Akram 2007, p. 61].&lt;/ref&gt;

Muhammad emphasized on refraining from fighting unless Quresh attacked. The Muslim army entered Mecca on Monday, 11 December 629 (18 Ramadan 8 hijrah).&lt;ref name="date"/&gt;   The entry was peaceful and bloodless entry on three sectors except for that of Khalid's column. The hardened anti-Muslims like Ikrimah and Sufwan gathered a band of Quresh fighters and faced Khalid's column. The Quresh attacked the Muslims with swords and bows, and the Muslims charged the Quresh's positions. After a short skirmish the Quresh gave ground after losing twelve men. Muslim losses were two warriors.&lt;ref name="Akram 2007, p. 61"&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/KhalidBinAl-waleedSwordOfAllah.pdf/KhalidBinAl-waleedSwordOfAllah#page/n61/mode/2up/search/column Akram 2007, p. 61].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath==
On the eve of the opening, Abu Sufyan adopted Islam. When asked by Muhammad, he conceded that the [[Arabian mythology|Meccan gods]] had proved powerless and that there was indeed "[[Shahada|no god but Allah]]", the first part of the Islamic confession of faith. In turn, Muhammad declared Abu Sufyan's house a sanctuary because he was the present chief, and that all the others were gathered over his territory, therefore:
:''"Even he Who enters the house of Abu Sufyan will be safe, He who lays down arms will be safe, He who locks his door will be safe"''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20110603230936/http://www.alwaraq.com/Core/AlwaraqSrv/bookpage?book=32&amp;fkey=2&amp;page=329 Page 329], ''[[The Complete History|Al-Kamil fi al-Tarikh]]'' by [[Ibn al-Athir]] {{ar icon}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

He also declared:
:''Allah has made Mecca a sanctuary since the day He created the Heavens and the Earth, and it will remain a sanctuary by virtue of the sanctity Allah has bestowed on it until the Day of Resurrection. It (fighting in it) was not made lawful to anyone before me. Nor will it be made lawful to anyone after me, and it was not made lawful for me except for a short period of time. Its animals (that can be hunted) should not be chased, nor should its trees be cut, nor its vegetation or grass uprooted, nor its Luqata (most things) picked up except by one who makes a public announcement about it.'''&lt;ref&gt;Sahih Bukhari, Volume 5, Book 59, Number 603&lt;/ref&gt;

Then, along with his companions Muhammad visited the [[Kaaba]]. The idols were broken and their gods were destroyed. Thereupon Muhammad recited the following verse from the [[Quran]]:''"Say, the Truth has come and falsehood gone. Verily falsehood is bound to vanish."''({{cite quran|17|81|s=ns|b=n}})

The people assembled at the Kaaba, and Muhammad delivered the following address:

:''"There is no God but Allah. He has no associate. He has made good His promise that He held to his bondman and helped him and defeated all the confederates. Bear in mind that every claim of privilege, whether that of blood or property is abolished except that of the custody of the Ka'aba and of supplying water to the pilgrims. Bear in mind that for any one who is slain the blood money is a hundred camels. People of Quraysh, surely God has abolished from you all pride of the time of ignorance and all pride in your ancestry, because all men are descended from Adam, and Adam was made of clay."''

Then Muhammad turning to the people said:

"O Quraysh, what do you think of the treatment that I should accord you?"

And they said, "Mercy, O Prophet of [[Allah]]. We expect nothing but good from you."

Thereupon Muhammad declared:

"I speak to you in the same words as [[Joseph in Islam|Yūsuf]] spoke to his brothers. This day there is no reproof against you; Go your way, for you are free."&lt;ref&gt;Related by Ibn Kathir, recorded by Ibn al-Hajjaj Muslim&lt;/ref&gt;
Muhammad's prestige grew after the surrender of the Meccans. Emissaries from all over [[Arabian Peninsula|Arabia]] came to Medina to accept him.&lt;ref name="iium.edu.my"&gt;[http://iium.edu.my/deed/hadith/abudawood/008_sat.html#008_2677] ''[[Abu Dawood]] 8:2677'' at [[International Islamic University Malaysia]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Ten people were ordered to be killed:&lt;ref name=Subhani&gt;''The Message'' by Ayatullah Ja'far Subhani, [http://www.al-islam.org/message/49.htm#n582 chapter 48] referencing [[Prophetic biography|Sirah]] by [[Ibn Hisham]], vol. II, page 409.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ikrimah ibn Abi-Jahl]], [[Abdullah ibn Saad]] ibn Abi Sarh, Habbar bin Aswad, Miqyas Subabah Laythi, Huwairath bin Nuqayd, Abdullah Hilal and four women who had been guilty of murder or other offences or had sparked off the war and disrupted the peace.&lt;ref name=Subhani/&gt;

However, they were not all killed; Ikrimah lived to adopt Islam and fight in future battles among Muslim ranks.
Of the two singing girls who were outlawed by Mohammad, one was slain but the other spared because she converted to Islam.&lt;ref&gt;[http://iium.edu.my/deed/hadith/abudawood/008_sat.html#008_2678] ''[[Abu Dawood]] 8:2678'' at [[International Islamic University Malaysia]]&lt;/ref&gt; Ibn Abi Sarh had been granted protection under Uthman ibn Affan and when he initially refused to take the mandatory oath of allegiance to Muhammad, the bystanders still did not kill him, due to misunderstanding the edict of Mohammad.&lt;ref name="iium.edu.my"/&gt;

The opening of Mecca was followed by the [[Battle of Hunayn]].

'''DJ Classics''' is the fourth solo [[concert]] by [[Filipino people|Filipino]] [[actor]] and [[Recording artist|singer]] [[Daniel Padilla]]. Scheduled in [[Smart Araneta Coliseum]] on February 5, 2017, but postponed due to his busy scheduled.

A '''donkey show''' is a type of sexual performance most often associated with [[Tijuana, Mexico]], in which a woman engages in [[bestiality]] with a [[donkey]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author= |title=Foreign Affairs |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=W18EAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA103 |quote='the donkey show,' which highlighted a Catherine the Great-style coupling| volume=45 |issue=6 |work=[[Los Angeles Magazine]] |date=June 1, 2000 |accessdate=2010-04-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=dawson&gt;{{cite book |author=[[Jim Dawson]] |title=Who Cut the Cheese?: A Cultural History of the Fart |year=1999 |quote=There was a time when guys would boast of having seen a girl-and-donkey show in Tijuana, Mexico.| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RLSXmhudzOQC&amp;pg=PA155 |isbn=1-58008-011-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The "donkey show" in Tijuana myth is deeply embedded in American film, including ''[[Losin' It]]'' (1983), ''[[Bachelor Party (1984 film)|Bachelor Party]]'' (1984), ''[[The 40-Year Old Virgin]]'' (2005), ''[[Clerks II]]'' (2006), ''[[The Heartbreak Kid (2007 film)|The Heartbreak Kid]]''&lt;!--1:05:06--&gt; (2007), and ''[[Cake (2014 film)|Cake]]''&lt;!--45:20--&gt; (2014).{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}}

In the 2005 book ''[[The Godfather Returns]]'' written by [[Mark Winegardner]], [[Fredo Corleone]]'s wife Deanna Dunn insists on attending one: "on a whim, they'd headed to Mexico. When they'd gotten there, Deanna Dunn, insisted on going to see a donkey show. ... who thought that watching a donkey fuck a teenage Indian girl was a hoot."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=[[Mark Winegardner]] |title=The Godfather Returns |year=2005 |publisher= |quote= |page=252 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oxnEQ29L2LgC&amp;pg=PA252&amp;dq#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |isbn= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is occasionally given as a reason to visit Tijuana. From time to time one may come across naive tourists going up and down ''La Coahuila'' street, unsuccessfully trying to find the show.&lt;ref name=alejandro&gt;{{cite book |title= Nor-tec rifa!: electronic dance music from Tijuana to the world |series= Currents in Iberian and Latin American Music |chapter= Where's the Donkey Show, Mr. Mariachi?

More recently the term has been used to describe a situation that has become a "complete mess".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=[[Jonathon Green]]  |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5GpLcC4a5fAC&amp;pg=PA428&amp;dq=%22donkey+show%22+sex&amp;ei=sqfzS6XUEZXakQSzncnZBw&amp;cd=2#v=onepage&amp;q=%22donkey%20show%22%20sex&amp;f=false |title=Cassell's dictionary of slang |accessdate=2010-05-21 |year=2005 |publisher=[[Sterling Publishing Company]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Environmental crime''' is an [[crime|illegal act]] which directly harms the [[Natural environment|environment]]. International bodies such as the [[G8]], [[Interpol]], [[European Union]], [[United Nations Environment Programme]] and the [[United Nations Interregional Crime and Justice Research Institute]] have recognised the following environmental crimes:

==Costs==
International criminal gangs and militant groups profit from the [[resource exploitation|plunder]] of [[natural resources]] and these illegal profits are soaring. Terrorism and even civil wars are consequences of environmental crime.&lt;ref&gt; Solheim, E., Need for global action, in: D+C 9 (2016), S. 46. [https://www.dandc.eu/en/article/environmental-crime-destroying-our-planet-undermining-peace-and-endangering-our-lives]&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[UNEP]] and [[Interpol]], in June 2016 the value of environmental crime is 26 per cent larger than previous estimates, at US$91–258 billion, compared to US$70–213 billion in 2014, outstripping [[Illegal arms trafficking|illegal trade in small arms]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=UNEP-INTERPOL Report: Value of Environmental Crime up 26%
|url=http://wed2016.com/unep-interpol-report-value-environmental-crime-26|date=2016-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; More than half of this amount can be attributed to [[illegal logging]] and [[deforestation]].

==Prosecution by [[International Criminal Court|ICC]]==
On September 2016 it was announced that the [[International Criminal Court]] located in [[The Hague]] will prosecute government and individuals for environmental crimes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Vidal|first1=John|last2=Bowcott|first2=Owen|title=ICC widens remit to include environmental destruction cases|url=https://www.theguardian.com/global/2016/sep/15/hague-court-widens-remit-to-include-environmental-destruction-cases|website=The Guardian|accessdate=20 September 2016|date=15 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the Case Selection Criteria announced in Policy Paper on Case Selection and Prioritisation by ICC on 15 September 2016, the Office will give particular consideration to prosecuting Rome Statute crimes that are committed by means of, or that result in, "inter alia, the destruction of the environment, the illegal exploitation of natural resources or the illegal dispossession of land".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=POLICY PAPER ON CASE SELECTION AND PRIORITISATION|url=https://www.icc-cpi.int/itemsDocuments/20160915_OTP-Policy_Case-Selection_Eng.pdf|website=icc-cpi.int|accessdate=20 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United Kingdom===

 --&gt;

===United States===
Abandoned or little used areas are common dumping places in America -especially railroads. Over $10 million a year are used to remove illegal dumping from polluting towns and the environment. A small organization, CSXT Police Environment Crimes Unit, has been started to stop railroad dumping specifically. 

Ever since the [[Environmental Protection Agency]]'s Office of Criminal Enforcement was founded in 1982, there has been a steady increase in prosecuted environmental crimes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.epa.gov/oecaerth/basics/criminal.html EPA Basic Information on criminal enforcement]&lt;/ref&gt; This includes the prosecution of companies that have [[illegal dumping|illegally dumped]] or caused [[oil spills]].  On a federal level, while the EPA oversees the investigations, the prosecutions are typically brought by the U.S. Department of Justice, through its Environmental Crimes Section, and/or through one of the 94 U.S. Attorney's Office across the country.

&lt;!--
== Nigeria ==
In Nigeria, the establishment of environmental agencies began in 1988 after an incident of dumping of toxic materials in the country by international waste traders (the infamous [[Koko, Nigeria | Koko]] incident). Presently, agencies such as the [[National Environmental Standards and Regulations Enforcement Agency]] are empowered by Nigerian law to regulate the environment sector. This agency works with other organs of the government such as customs, police, military intelligence, etc., and has successfully seized illegally trafficked wildlife products and prosecuted a number persons, including non-nationals.

 --&gt;

==Enforcement==
The effective [[law enforcement|enforcement]] of [[environmental law]]s is vital to any protection regimes that are designed to protect the environment. In the early days of environmental legislation, violations carried largely insignificant [[civil fine]]s and penalties. Initial environmental laws and regulations had little or no deterrent effect on corporations, individuals, or governments to comply with environmental laws. Indeed, a major source of failure of US environmental protection legislation was the civil character of federal enforcement actions. Their chief sanction was fines, which many corporations took in stride as a cost of doing business. Environmental criminal law covers narrower ground. Its core consists of the criminal provisions of eight federal statutes passed mainly in the 1970s and amended in the last two decades.&lt;ref&gt;Environmental Crime: The Criminal Justice System's Role in Protecting the Environment By Yingyi Situ, David Emmons Published by Sage Publications, 1999 {{ISBN|0-7619-0036-5}}, {{ISBN|978-0-7619-0036-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In many cases, particularly corporations found it more cost-effective to continue to pollute more than the law allowed and simply pay any associate fines if indeed the corporation was actually found and convicted of violating environmental laws or regulations. Perversely, corporations actually had a disincentive to comply with environmental laws or regulations as compliance generally  raised their operational costs which meant that many corporations obeying the environmental laws, whether out of a sense of legal duty or public obligation, were disadvantaged and lost a [[competitiveness|competitive edge]] and consequently suffered in the marketplace to competitors who disregarded environmental laws and regulations. As a result of weak environmental legislation and continued adverse public opinion regarding the management of the environment, many governments established various environmental enforcement regimes that dramatically increased the legal powers of environmental investigators. The inclusion of criminal sanctions, significant increases in fines coupled with possible imprisonment of corporate officers changed the face of environmental law enforcement. For example, between 1983 and 1990 the [[US Department of Justice]] secured $57,358,404.00 in criminal penalties and obtained sentences of imprisonment for 55% of defendants charged with environmental offences.&lt;ref name="tomkins"&gt;Tomkins, Kevin. Police, Law Enforcement and the Environment [online]. Current Issues in Criminal Justice; Volume 16, Issue 3; Mar 2005; 294-306&lt;/ref&gt;

Enforcing environmental laws and regulations is an important ingredient in protecting the environment and reducing environmental harm. This is generally achieved by various environmental law enforcement agencies operating at an International, Regional, National, State and Local level. For instance, to some extent environmental law enforcement agencies operate only at an international level whereas others only operate at the local level. Furthermore, environmental law enforcement agencies utilise various enforcement methods to ensure compliance to environmental legislation. In some cases enforcement agencies rely on coercive powers to demand compliance to environmental laws, generally labelled “command and control” strategies, while others rely on conciliatory and educational strategies to persuade individuals, organisations and governments to comply with environmental laws and regulations. Moreover, it has increased the need for cooperation between different policing institutions.&lt;ref name="tomkins"/&gt;
Environmental law enforcement agencies and police services do not operate in a vacuum; the legislative instruments that political systems implement govern their activities and responsibilities within society. However, ostensibly it is the legislative instruments implemented by governments that determine many of the strategies utilised by police services in protecting the environment. Generally these International, Regional, National and State legislative instruments are designed to ensure industries, individuals, and governments comply with the various environmental obligations embedded in national statutes and laws. There are also international legal instruments and treaties that also affect the way that sovereign states deal with environmental issues .&lt;ref name="tomkins"/&gt;

==Environmental criminology==
{{main article|Environmental criminology|Green criminology}}
Environmental criminology examines the notions of crimes, offences and injurious behaviours against the environment and starts to examine the role that societies including corporations, governments and communities play in generating environmental harms. Criminology is now starting to recognise the impact of humans on the environment and how law enforcement agencies and the judiciary measure harm to the environment and attribute sanctions to the offenders.&lt;ref&gt;White, R. 2003‘Environmental Issues and the Criminological Imagination’, Theoretical Criminology, 7(4): 483-506.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
No sooner had aircraft developed to the stage that they would stay airborne for predictable amounts of time, than pilots had started to pit their skills and aircraft against each other both personally and on a national basis.

===Schneider Trophy===
Whilst the [[Schneider Trophy]] is probably the epitome of air racing involving the most technically advanced aircraft, it soon became obvious that, with so many different types in development, there would have to be some form of handicapping of aircraft to level the playing field.

===King's Cup Race===
The modern-day handicapped air race began in 1922 and was sponsored by King [[George V]] — called the [[King's Cup Race]].  In 1931 the rules were re-written to allow for what might be termed amateur pilots to compete and those same rules still apply today.  The King’s Cup was the first and only air race to receive royal patronage.

===Records Racing and Rally Association===
Whilst this was a British phenomenon, the handicapping concept has been used to stage races worldwide. Especially popular in the technologically superior Europe, it became known through the [[Royal Aero Club Records Racing and Rally Association]]. This organisation runs an annual programme of 14 to 18 races at seven to nine different venues, mainly in the UK but at least two or three in Europe.

===European Championship===
In 2000, the organisation launched a European Championship aimed at attracting a wider audience of European competitors.  This championship is run within the Royal Aero Club RRR’s normal season of races but the champion is the pilot/navigator combination that scores the highest number of aggregate points over 6 races held at 3 different venues. These venues have included the UK, France, Spain, the Channel Isles, Ireland and the Isle of Man.

'''Fun Fun Fun Fest''' (often abbreviated as "FFF" or "F3F") was an annual music and comedy festival held in [[Austin, Texas]]. The festival was the only genre based festival in the [[United States]], featuring stages that focus specifically on [[Hip hop music|hip-hop]] / [[electronica]], [[indie rock]], [[Punk rock|punk]] / [[Heavy metal music|metal]], and [[comedy]].

Started in 2006, the festival focuses on a combination of discovering emerging talent, putting together either rarely seen or anticipated reunion performances. Being based in Austin (The Live Music Capital of the World), FFF has the unique ability to work with new musicians that have yet to experience the national stage. The festival has a history of unearthing new artists that eventually end up in the mainstream music and festival markets. The festival's name itself was a nod to the historical independent music scene in Austin, specifically [[Big Boys]], an early and highly influential [[hardcore punk]] group who released their EP "Fun Fun Fun" through the Austin-based underground label [[Moment Productions]] in 1982.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.discogs.com/Big-Boys-Fun-Fun-Fun/release/3995206&lt;/ref&gt;. After the final Fun Fun Fun Fest, some of the organizers would go on to produce [[Sound on Sound Fest]], "Sound on Sound" also being the title of a Big Boys song.

Fun Fun Fun Fest was known for its dedication to the unique Austin culture, featuring street food from some of Austin's favorite eateries, an annual American Poster Institute poster show featuring work from artists all over the U.S., along with pop up vintage fashion shops, hair salons, and record stores. The Festival has also been known to have everything from a mechanical bull to a live wrestling ring featuring Sexy Sax Man on site.

Notable acts from the past include [[Public Enemy (group)|Public Enemy]], [[Spoon (band)|Spoon]], [[Weird Al Yankovic]], [[Girl Talk (musician)|Girl Talk]], [[The Descendents]], [[MGMT]], [[Bad Religion]], [[Danzig (band)|Danzig]], [[Mastodon (band)|Mastodon]], [[The Dead Milkmen]], [[Slick Rick]], [[Pharcyde]], [[Cat Power]], [[The National (band)|The National]], [[M83 (band)|M83]], [[Circle Jerks]], [[Todd Barry]], [[Reggie Watts]], [[Henry Rollins]], [[Neil Hamburger]], [[GWAR]], and the return of famed Detroit punkers, [[Death (protopunk band)|Death]], and many more.

In 2011, Fun Fun Fun Fest was moved to [[Auditorium Shores]], a much larger downtown park, a change from previous years in which the event was held at Waterloo Park. In addition, 2011 saw the addition of a third full day and FFF Nites, a set of free aftershows for ticket holders in downtown Austin music venues, featuring an additional 75+ artists. Additionally, [[Ryan Gosling]]  and [[Rooney Mara]] filmed a sequence for an upcoming [[Terrence Malick]] film on November 4, 2011, at the festival.

The 2012 festival took place November 2–4 at Auditorium Shores. The event made headlines by announcing the reunion of the hip hop group, [[Run–D.M.C.]] for their first show in a decade.

The festival had its final show in 2015. Some of the event producers have moved on to produce an event called [[Sound on Sound Fest|Sound on Sound Music Festival]], which takes place at the Sherwood Forest Faire site in [[McDade, Texas|Mcdade, TX]]

===Fun Fun Fun Fest Taco Cannon===
First premiered at the 2012 Fun Fun Fun Fest in Austin, TX, the Fun Fun Fun Fest Taco Cannon was a modified 12-chamber T-shirt cannon specifically designed to shoot tacos a maximum 200 feet in the air. The Fun Fun Fun Fest Taco Cannon was the first and only taco launching device. The cannon was powered by carbon dioxide and a car battery, and "takes 40 pounds of carbon dioxide to get through three round of Gatling gun-style shots" with "12 barrels in each round, so 36 shots total per round." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Watson|first=Eli|title=Fun Fun Fun Fest cannon launches Torchy's tacos|url=http://www.dailytexanonline.com/life-and-arts/2012/10/31/fun-fun-fun-fest-cannon-launches-torchys-tacos|accessdate=26 July 2013|newspaper=Daily Texan|date=2012-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Georgian intervention in [[Chaldia]]''' was undertaken by Queen [[Tamar the Great|Tamar]] in 1204. The [[Empire of Trebizond]] was founded on the [[Black Sea]] coast as a result of this expedition.

== History ==
Queen [[Tamar of Georgia|Tamar]]'s attitude towards the [[List of Byzantine emperors|emperors]] of Byzantine, ruled by [[Angelos]], were somehow hostile; closely related to the [[Komnenoi]],&lt;ref&gt;Toumanoff, [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2855207 "On the Relationship between the Founder of the Empire of Trebizond and the Georgian Queen Thamar"], ''Speculum'', '''15''' (1940), pp. 299–312&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kuršanskis, [http://www.persee.fr/web/revues/home/prescript/article/rebyz_0766-5598_1977_num_35_1_2073 "L'Empire de Trébizonde et la Géorgie"], ''Revue des études byzantines'', '''35''' (1977). pp. 237–256&lt;/ref&gt; she could not forget that last Komnenos emperor of Byzantine [[Andronikos I Komnenos]] was dethroned and killed by the Angelos in 1185, while his son [[Manuel Komnenos (son of Andronikos I)|Manuel]] was blinded and may have died from this mutilation.&lt;ref name="Mikaberidze, A. (2015)."&gt;Mikaberidze, A. (2015). Historical dictionary of Georgia. 2nd ed. Lanham, MD, United States: ROWMAN &amp; LITTLEFIELD, p.634.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;A. A. Vasiliev, [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2846872 "The Foundation of the Empire of Trebizond (1204-1222)"], ''Speculum'', '''11''' (1936), pp. 5-8&lt;/ref&gt; however, his two infant grandsons, [[Alexios I of Trebizond|Alexios]] and [[David Komnenos|David]], sons of the Manuel and a [[Rusudan, daughter of George III of Georgia|Georgian princess]], were saved through Georgian intervention and taken to [[Tbilisi]], where they were raised at the court of their aunt and queen of Georgia,Tamar.&lt;ref name="Mikaberidze, A. (2015)."/&gt; In Georgia they had received their education, Vasiliev even speculates that "[[Georgian language|Georgian]] became their native tongue" and that they "were thoroughly Georgian in language and education as well as in political ideals".&lt;ref&gt;Vasiliev, "Foundation", p. 18&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1203, Tamar donated large sums of money to the Georgian monasteries in [[Antioch]] and [[Mount Athos]]. However, Emperor Alexios III Angelos confiscated Tamar’s donation. Infuriated by this action, Tamar used this hostile act as a pretext for her expansion along the southwestern coast of the [[Black Sea]], populated by a large Georgian-speaking population.&lt;ref name="Mikaberidze, A. (2015)."/&gt;

Georgian army under the command of Alexios and David Komnenos attacked the Byzantine from the east in late March or early April 1204. According to Georgian chronicles expedition took eight days, it reached Trebizond via [[Lazia (Pontus)|Lazia]] and seized [[Trabzon|Trebizond]] in April. The local commander [[Dux|doux]] Nikephoros Palaiologos, did not put up an effective defence against the more powerful Georgian forces.

On April 13, 1204, [[Fall of Constantinople|Constantinople fell]] to the [[Crusaders]], where they established the [[Latin Empire]]. according to Georgian sources, newly incorporated territories were given to Alexios and David Komnenos, where they established a pro-Georgian state. Alexios was proclaimed [[emperor]], while David was appointed [[strategos]]. Some scholars believe that the new state was subject to Georgia, at least in the first years of its existence, at the beginning of the 13th century.&lt;ref&gt;Vasiliev, A.A., “The Foundation of the Empire of Trebizond 1204-1222”, Speculum 11 (1936), pp. 3-37·&lt;/ref&gt;

The following year, David Komnenos commanded the Georgian troops in a successful campaign that resulted in the conquest of territory between Trebizond and [[Heraclea Pontica]], while Alexios defeated the [[Seljuq dynasty|Seljuks]] and recaptured [[Samsun|Amisos]], [[Sinop, Turkey|Sinope]], [[Ünye|Oinaion]] and [[Chalybes|Chalybia]].

{{Greek economic crisis}}
The '''Greek government formation of May 2012''' was a series of failed attempts to form a new government after the [[Greek legislative election, May 2012|legislative election in May 2012]] by the three largest parties: [[New Democracy (Greece)|New Democracy]] (centre-right), [[Coalition of the Radical Left]] (SYRIZA, left-far left) and [[Panhellenic Socialist Movement]] (PASOK, centre-Left), respectively, and then followed by the [[President of Greece]]. After the negotiations led by the president had failed on 15 May, a temporary [[Caretaker Cabinet of Panagiotis Pikrammenos|caretaker cabinet]] under [[Council of State (Greece)|Council of State]] president [[Panagiotis Pikrammenos]] was appointed on 16 May, and a [[Greek legislative election, June 2012|new election]] was set for 17 June.

==Procedure==
Article 37 of the Greek constitution stipulates the procedure for attempts to form governments after a national legislative election. As the [[Greek legislative election, May 2012|2012 Greek legislative election]] resulted in no single party with a majority of parliament seats, the Greek constitution stipulates that the largest party in relative terms of the voting result, shall be given a chance to negotiate the formation of a government within three days. Failing that, the second largest party will get a chance within the next three days and if this attempt also fails the third biggest party will get a further three days to try and form a government. If neither of the three largest parties can succeed in forming a government, the baton will be handed over to the president for a last neutral attempt to form a government, where he will meet with all party leaders. If this attempt fails as well, a temporary [[caretaker government]] will be formed with the purpose of setting up a date for a new legislative election.&lt;ref name="Greek Constitution"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hellenicparliament.gr/UserFiles/f3c70a23-7696-49db-9148-f24dce6a27c8/001-156%20aggliko.pdf|title=The official English language translation of the Greek Constitution as of 27 May 2008|publisher=Hellenic Parliament|date=27 May 2008|accessdate=13 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/news/europe/2012/05/201256165643443598.html |title=Greece exit polls suggest no majority win – Europe |publisher=Al Jazeera English |date=4 October 2011 |accessdate=7 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="teleg"/&gt;

If this attempt fails, then, according to article 37 paragraph 3 in the [[constitution of Greece]],&lt;ref name="Greek Constitution"/&gt; the president will try to form a temporary caretaker government with all parties for the purpose of preparing for an election. If this fails yet again the President of the Supreme Administrative Court, the President of the Supreme Civil and Criminal Court or the President of the Court of Audit, will be called to form a temporary caretaker government with the widest available support in order to prepare for a new election.&lt;ref name="Chances to form a unity government are slim"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ekathimerini.com/4dcgi/_w_articles_wsite1_1_11/05/2012_441670|title=Greek government talks in final stretch |publisher=Ekathimerini|date=11 May 2012|accessdate=11 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Negotiations by New Democracy==
The day after the election, president [[Karolos Papoulias]] met with the leader of the largest party—[[New Democracy (Greece)|New Democracy]]'s (ND) leader [[Antonis Samaras]]—to task him with the first attempt to form a government.&lt;ref name="reut"&gt;{{cite web|last=Kyriakidou |first=Dina |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2012/05/07/us-greece-idUSBRE8440DG20120507 |title=Left gets historic chance to pull Greece out of limbo |publisher=Reuters |date=3 May 2012 |accessdate=7 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Democratic Left (Greece)|Democratic Left]] (DIMAR) declared that the party would not join a pro-bailout New Democracy-PASOK grand coalition government. Democratic Left leader [[Fotis Kouvelis]] said that his party would only "participate in a coalition government with other progressive forces," such as the other leftist anti-bailout parties SYRIZA and [[Communist Party of Greece]] (KKE).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/reuters/2012/05/07/world/europe/07reuters-greece-election-kouvelis.html?_r=1&amp;hp|title=Exclusive: Greece's Democratic Left Refuses to Join Bailout Alliance|publisher=Reuters|date=7 May 2012|accessdate=7 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; SYRIZA's [[Alexis Tsipras]] refused to join in a coalition with ND saying that: "The campaign positions of Mr Samaras are at the opposite end of the alternative proposals of a left-wing government. There can be no government of national salvation, as Samaras has named it, because his signatures and commitments to the loan agreement do not constitute salvation but a tragedy for the people and the country."&lt;ref name="fail1"/&gt; [[Independent Greeks]] (ANEL) also refused to discuss joining a coalition with ND. For its part, ND said that it would be open to talks with any party except [[Golden Dawn (Greece)|Golden Dawn]] (XA), with Samaras saying he would likely end his efforts the following day, ahead of the deadline.&lt;ref name="reut"/&gt; KKE also refused to discuss the possibility of a government with ND. PASOK also said that it would consider joining a grand coalition only if other left-wing parties were in the government. At the end of the first day itself, ND's Samaras announced that he had failed in trying to form a "national salvation" government: "I did whatever I could to secure a result but it was impossible. I informed Papoulias and returned the mandate."&lt;ref name="fail1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/news/europe/2012/05/201257144649316327.html |title=Leading Greek party fails to form government - Europe |publisher=Al Jazeera English |date=4 October 2011 |accessdate=7 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Negotiations by SYRIZA==
On 8 May, Tsipras was tasked by Papoulias to attempt forming a government&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-17984805 |title=BBC News - Greek election: Antonis Samaras coalition bid fails |publisher=BBC News|date= |accessdate=7 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; within the stipulated three days. Tsipras stated that "we will exhaust all possibilities to reach an understanding, primarily with the forces of the left" and that the election result was a "message of overthrow against the barbaric measures put forth by the EU-IMF loan agreement."&lt;ref name="teleg"&gt;{{cite web|author=|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/greece/9251443/Greece-radical-Leftist-Syriza-party-to-try-to-build-anti-austerity-cabinet.html |title=Greece radical Leftist Syriza party to try to build anti-austerity cabinet |publisher=Telegraph |date=8 May 2012 |accessdate=8 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tsipras said he wanted ND and PASOK to tell the EU in writing that they would not adhere to their pledge to maintain the austerity measures demanded before meeting them on 9 May saying that "the bailout parties no longer have a majority in parliament to vote for measures that plunder the country." ND's Antonis Samaras refused to do so and said that he would support a minority government if need be.&lt;ref name="bbergsyr"&gt;{{cite web|last=Petrakis |first=Maria |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-05-08/greek-government-mandate-passes-to-syriza-after-samaras-fails.html |title=Greek Pro-Bailout Leaders Told by Syriza to Revoke Aid Pledges |publisher=Bloomberg |date= |accessdate=8 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also said Tsipras' demands could "lead to immediate internal collapse and international bankruptcy, with the inevitable exit from Europe."

The Independent Greeks' [[Panos Kammenos]] had also criticised Tsipras already one week ahead of the election day, saying that "there is not a sufficient majority to form an anti-memorandum front."&lt;ref name="indep"&gt;{{cite news|author=Daniel Howden |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/greeces-radical-new-leader-alexis-tsipras-plots-course-to-tear-up-bailout-deal-7729069.html |title=Greece's radical new leader Alexis Tsipras plots course to tear up bailout deal |publisher=The Independent |date=30 April 2012 |accessdate=13 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; As he had calculated that SYRIZA’s 52 MPs, Independent Greeks’ 33 and Democratic Left's 19 did not add up to the minority of 120 seats needed, in view of the Communist Party’s refusal. He also said that the discussion of "issues of national importance, including the [[Macedonia naming issue]] and illegal immigration, led to differences of opinion."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ekathimerini.com/4dcgi/_w_articles_wsite1_20959_09/05/2012_441395|title=Venizelos to try forming a gov't|last=|first=|date=9 May 2012|website=|publisher=ekathimerini.com|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=13 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tsipras then later said his attempts had failed and told his parliamentary group that "we cannot make true our dream of a left-wing government. Tomorrow, I shall hand back the mandate given to me by the president of the republic and we shall continue to take part in the constitutional processes." He had previously said the election "has clearly nullified the loan agreement and [pledges] sent to Europe and the IMF" ([[International Monetary Fund]]).&lt;ref name="aljazsyr"/&gt;

At the same time the EU decided to continue with Greece's disbursements which mean sending US$5.4 billion on 10 May, but an additional US$1.29 billion was held back. As a result of the political imbroglio both PASOK and ND suggested the EU and IMF agreement could have to be re-evaluated. In response, Luxembourg Foreign Minister [[Jean Asselborn]] said that "we have to say to the Greek people right now that the situation is serious, that no European Union country will be able to release even a portion of the 130 billion euros for the Greeks, if there is no functioning government that respects the rules and manages the disbursed money." German Chancellor [[Angela Merkel]] added that "everyone must stick to the things we have agreed. Twenty-five countries have already...signed the fiscal pact," targeting Greece and France, who also had [[French presidential election, 2012|election at the same time]]. Germany's finance minister [[Wolfgang Schaeuble]] also said that "if Greece wants to remain in the eurozone, there is no better solution than the path it has already taken. You can't have one [bailout funds from EU and IMF] without the other [austerity measures to limit the budget deficits]."&lt;ref name="aljazsyr"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/news/europe/2012/05/20125919544731172.html |title=Greek far-left leader fails in coalition bid |publisher=Al Jazeera English |date= |accessdate=13 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; While Germany's foreign minister [[Guido Westerwelle]] finally added that "Germany would like to keep Greece in the eurozone, but whether Greece remains in the eurozone or not lies in its own hands."&lt;ref name="indep"/&gt;

==Negotiations by PASOK==
The Greek newspaper [[Proto Thema]] claimed by the dawn of 9 May, that according to an anonymous source, PASOK leader Venizelos had decided he would not even accept the mandate to form a government, but instead straight away ask Papoulias to call a meeting of party leaders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/greece/9254112/Greek-Syriza-leader-hands-rivals-ultimatum-to-renounce-austerity.html |title=Greek Syriza leader hands rivals ultimatum to renounce austerity |publisher=Telegraph |date=9 May 2012 |accessdate=13 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fxstreet.com/news/forex-news/article.aspx?storyid=9f3c4050-30e9-4f4e-b683-b7b4bd2d96ef|title=Greece’s Venizelos won’t accept government mandate, Proto Thema says|publisher=FXstreet.com|date=9 May 2012|accessdate=9 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later the same day, however, after Tsipras announced that he had failed to form a government,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zougla.gr/politiki/article/ti-trexi|title=What's up| publisher=Zougla|date=9 May 2012 |accessdate=9 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Venizelos stated that during the course of the day new unexplored opportunities had emerged, and thus he would now try to form a [[national unity government]] within the stipulated three-day period, comprising either: PASOK, New Democracy, SYRIZA and Democratic Left (DIMAR), or in the alternative: PASOK, SYRIZA, DIMAR and Independent Greeks (ANEL) if all parties in that formation agreed to pledge a guarantee on Greece’s future course in the euro.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-05-09/venizelos-says-he-ll-continue-efforts-to-form-greek-government.html|title=Venizelos Says He’ll Continue Efforts to Form Greek Government|publisher=Bloomberg|date=9 May 2012|accessdate=9 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the first day with Venizelos negotiations, the meeting with DIMAR's Fotis Kouvelis was said to have though of forming a unity government with the purpose of keeping Greece within the European Union and eurozone, while respecting the outcome of the election in regards of also working for the gradual disengagement from the EU-IMF memorandum. According to Kouvelis, such a government should work out its mandate in the time frame until the European elections of 2014.&lt;ref name="Venezelos negotiate to form a unity government with Kouvelis"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ekathimerini.com/4dcgi/_w_articles_wsite1_1_10/05/2012_441563|title=Greece closer to unity government after Venizelos, Kouvelis talks |publisher=Ekathimerini|date=10 May 2012|accessdate=10 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Venizelos stated that: "The discussion we had with Mr Kouvelis was very substantive.

==Negotiations by Papoulias==
President Karolos Papoulias called all party leaders to a meeting on 13 May in a final attempt to form a national unity government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-18044253 |title=Greece bailout crisis: President seeks unity government |publisher=BBC News |date=12 May 2012|accessdate=13 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

|publisher=Ekathimerini|date=13 May 2012|accessdate=14 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to SYRIZA's refusal to participate in the government, DIMAR again stated a government without SYRIZA would not have the necessary popular support.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Paul Mason |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-18055629 |title=BBC News - Greece's moderate left says no government possible |publisher=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; DIMAR leader Kouvelis also said that SYRIZA was inclined to want a new election due its expected improved performance; he added that Greece should also "disengage" from the terms of the EU-IMF deal. Ethnos echoed the words saying that "Syriza has opened the way to new elections and this time it will be a sort of referendum [on the bailout]."&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite web|first=Bryan|last=McManus|url=https://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5g3t4bsRXZd9h5nfOtmPEE6QaRoqQ?docId=CNG.ba931eaf00377ee5bd435da4bb4fc82f.671 |title=Greek president calls for technocrat government|date=15 May 2012|publisher=AFP|location=Athens|accessdate=17 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 13 May, Papoulias claimed to have a letter from incumbent interim Prime Minister [[Lucas Papademos]] which asserts that the Ministry of Finance would only afford to pay salaries and pensions until the end of June and that Papademos had warned of the urgent need for Greek to recapitalise their liquid assets following large losses in a bond exchange programme that decreased almost a third of the Greek debt of 350 billion euros.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; Though talks were scheduled to be held on 15 May, DIMAR executive board member [[Dimitris Hadzisokratis]] said that it would not join a government that is unrepresentative of "the majority of Greek society. The last thing Greece needs is another round of elections but that is what is going to happen. We have decided that we cannot participate in a government that does not reflect the majority will of Greek society. I say this with a heavy heart. We would have preferred otherwise."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Helena Smith in Athens |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/may/14/greece-hold-more-coalition-talks |title=Greece to hold more coalition talks &amp;#124; World news |publisher=The Guardian |date=2009-09-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the same time, Papoulias was told by the head of the [[Bank of Greece]] [[George Provopoulos]] that local financial institutions were concerned about a [[bank run]] with the increased rate of withdrawal of euros, which were up to 700 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Weeks |first=Natalie |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-05-15/greek-president-told-banks-anxious-as-deposits-pulled.html |title=Greek President Told Banks Anxious as Deposits Pulled |publisher=Bloomberg }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Harballabh Sangeet Sammelan''' is the oldest festival of Indian Classical Music in the world, which is celebrated every year at the sacred seat of music, the samadhi of [[Baba Harballabh]] – a saint and an exponent of Hindustani Classical Music.
The first Sammelan was held in 1875 at the Sidh Peeth-Shri Devi Talab, in [[Jalandhar]]. Since then it has been held every year.&lt;ref&gt;[http://harballabh.org/] Harballabh site&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The Sangeet Sammelan which has grown from strength to strength in the last 131 years has been attracting audiences and artists from all across the country and abroad. This festival was declared as one of the National Festivals by the Department of Tourism, [[Govt. of India]]. All prominent artists of Hindustani Classical Music from [[India]] and [[Pakistan]] have come and performed at the Harballabh Sangeet Sammelan at one time or the other during the last 130 years. Father of the Nation, [[Mahatma Gandhi]] accompanied by [[Vishnu Digambar Paluskar]] visited Baba Harballabh Sangeet Sammelan in the year 1919. Union Ministers, Governors, State Chief Ministers, State Ministers and other VIPs have been visiting to pay their reverence at this festival of music. The festival attracts thousands of music lovers from all over the India and abroad every year. This number is increasing year after year.

In 1956 a Sangeet Academy was constructed under the banner of Swami Hariballabh. While we hear Swami Hariballabh it seems clear that “The key to the mystery of a great artist is that for reasons unknown, he will give away his energies and his life just to make sure that one note follows another... and leaves us with the feeling that something is right in the world.” 

==The festival==
The main aim of the festival was to attract and encourage more and more people for the development of classical Music. There is also a proper syllabus for the pursuers of Music and there is a shrine at the banks of the river with the name Devi Talab. There is a Shiva lingam in the temple nearby and one adores the exquisite phallic image of Lord [[Shiva]]. On the day of the fair there is also free lodging and accommodation.

==Venue==
It is held near the Samadhi of Saint Harballabh, from the 27th to 30 December. During this time reputed musicians from all over India gather in Jalandhar to celebrate Indian Classical Music.

A '''hickey''', '''hickie''' or '''love bite''' in [[British English]], is a [[bruise]] or bruise-like mark caused by the [[kissing]] or sucking of the [[skin]], usually on the [[neck]] or [[arm]]. While biting might be part of giving a hickey, sucking is sufficient to burst small superficial [[blood vessels]] under the skin. 

The origin of the word is from its earlier meaning of "pimple, skin lesion" (c. 1915); perhaps a sense extension and spelling variation from the earlier word meaning "small gadget, device; any unspecified object" which has an unknown origin (1909).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.etymonline.com/word/hickie|title=hickie - Origin and meaning of hickie by Online Etymology Dictionary|website=www.etymonline.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hickeys typically last from 5 to 12 days and may be treated in the same way as other bruises.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ownarticles.com/how-long-do-hickeys-last |title=How Long Do Hickeys Last |date=April 15, 2016|website=ownarticles.com |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160520071039/http://ownarticles.com/how-long-do-hickeys-last |archivedate=2016-05-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ways to reduce the appearance of hickeys include icing recent hickeys to reduce swelling, rubbing them with a chilled spoon to remove the bruise, and applying a [[warm compress]] to older hickeys to dilate vessels and promote blood flow.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life/relationships/man-woman/Ouch-Thats-a-lovebite/articleshow/4680691.cms|title=Ouch!

Alternatively, articles of clothing such as [[scarf|scarves]], [[snood (headgear)|snoods]], [[polo neck|turtle necks]], or [[sleeve]]s may be used to conceal hickeys.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5513">A '''hot prowl burglary''' is a sub-type of [[burglary]] in which the offender enters a building or residence while occupants are inside the location.  The overarching intent of a hot prowl burglary can be [[theft]], [[robbery]], [[sexual assault]], [[murder]], or another crime.

Hot prowl burglaries are considered especially dangerous by law enforcement because of the potential for a violent altercation to erupt between the occupant and the offender.&lt;ref&gt;"Dubin said such cases, which involve a burglar breaking into a home while occupants are inside, are particularly worrisome for law enforcement because of their potential for violent confrontation." http://www.signalscv.com/section/36/article/103934/&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Notable examples==

The [[Lindbergh Kidnapping]] - In 1932, one-year-old [[Charles Augustus Lindbergh, Jr.]] was kidnapped from his family's home in East Amwell, [[New Jersey]] and later murdered.  The offender perpetrated the crime by using a ladder to enter a second floor bedroom of the Lindbergh residence while the family was asleep.  [[Bruno Hauptmann]], a German immigrant, was convicted of [[kidnapping]] and murdering the [[infant]].  He was executed by electrocution in 1936.  The case received international attention and was considered "the crime of the century" because the victim's father was famed aviator [[Charles Lindbergh]].

The BTK Killer - Between 1974 and 1991, a series of sexual assaults and murders was carried out in the [[Wichita, Kansas]] area.  In most of the attacks, the offender broke into or forced his way into a residence, then killed one or more people.  [[Dennis Rader]], a compliance officer for the city of [[Park City, Kansas]], was arrested for the BTK murders in 2005.  Rader pleaded guilty to the crimes and is serving a life sentence.

The [[Original Night Stalker]] - Also known by the monikers "East Area Rapist," the "Diamond Knot Killer," and more recently the "Golden State Killer," is a serial killer and rapist who was active in [[California]] in the 1970s and 1980s.  The Original Night Stalker is known to have murdered ten people in Orange, Santa Barbara, and Ventura counties between 1979 and 1986.  In 2001, a criminalist with the [[Orange County Sheriff's Department (California)|Orange County Sheriff's Department]] linked the Original Night Stalker to over fifty rapes which were committed in northern [[California]] between 1976 and 1979.  The Original Night Stalker's [[modus operandi]] was to break into the homes of his victims in the middle of the night, then attack them as they slept.  On April 25, 2018, Sacramento Police announced the arrest of a suspect in the case; 72-year-old Joseph James DeAngelo was arrested and charged with two counts of first-degree murder.&lt;ref&gt; http://www.sacbee.com/news/local/crime/article209779364.html &lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Richard Ramirez#"Night Stalker" crimes|Night Stalker]] - A series of murders, rapes, and robberies plagued the [[Los Angeles, California]] area in the mid-1980s.  In all, twelve murders were committed in southern California as part of this series.  Ultimately, the Los Angeles-area crimes were connected to two murders in [[San Francisco, California]].  In 1989, a Texas-born drug addict and convicted car thief named [[Richard Ramirez]] was convicted of the Night Stalker crimes. Ramirez died of complications secondary to [[B-cell lymphoma]] at Marin General Hospital in [[Greenbrae, California]], on June 7, 2013, after 23 years of incarceration at [[San Quentin State Prison]].

The [[Clutter Family Murders]] - In 1959, a quadruple murder rocked the small town of [[Holcomb, Kansas]].  The victims were a rancher named Herb Clutter and his wife Bonnie, as well as their two children Nancy and Kenyon.  The offenders, who were later identified as [[Richard Hickock]] and [[Perry Smith (murderer)|Perry Smith]], broke into the rural Clutter home with the intent of robbing the owner.  After taking a small sum of money and a few of the Clutters' belongings, Hickock and Smith tied up the family in various parts of the house.

Eventually, Smith slashed Herb Clutter's throat and shot Kenyon with a shotgun.  There is some question as to whether Hickock or Smith murdered Bonnie and Nancy Clutter, but nevertheless, both females were killed by shotgun blasts.  Both Hickock and Smith were executed by hanging on April 14, 1965.  The story of the Clutter Family Murders was immortalized by [[Truman Capote]] in the classic [[true crime]] book ''[[In Cold Blood]].''

The term '''international child abduction''' is generally synonymous with international ''parental [[kidnapping]],'' ''child snatching'', and ''child stealing.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://travel.state.gov/abduction/resources/resources_545.html |title=THE EPIDEMIC OF PARENTAL CHILD-SNATCHING: AN OVERVIEW |publisher=US Department of State |author=HON. WILLIAM RIGLER and HOWARD L. WIEDER |year=2000|accessdate=2010-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, the more precise legal usage of ''international child abduction'' originates in [[private international law]] and refers to the illegal removal of children from their home by an acquaintance or family member to a foreign country. In this context, "illegal" is normally taken to mean "in breach of [[child custody|custodial rights]]" and "home" is defined as the child's [[habitual residence]]. As implied by the "breach of custodial rights," the phenomenon of international child abduction generally involves an illegal removal that creates a jurisdictional [[conflict of laws]] whereby multiple authorities and [[jurisdiction]]s could conceivably arrive at seemingly reasonable and conflicting custodial decisions with geographically limited application. Such a result often strongly affects a child's access and connection to half their family and may cause the loss of their former language, culture, name and nationality, it violates numerous [[children's rights]], and can cause severe psychological and emotional trauma to the child and family left behind.&lt;ref name="2010 Compliance Report"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://travel.state.gov/pdf/2010ComplianceReport.pdf |title=2010 Compliance Report |publisher=Travel.state.gov |date=|accessdate=2010-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is a common misconception that because the abductor in these cases is usually not a stranger the children are not in danger.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hawaii.gov/ag/mcch/files/kid_is_with_a_parent.pdf  |title="The kid is with a parent, how bad can it be?"

International child abduction occurs when one parent unlawfully takes (or retains) a [[Minor (law)|minor]] child in a country other than the one the child has his/her habitual residence. If that country is a party to the [[Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction]] (applicable to children under 16), then the child will usually be returned to the country of origin. 

== Origin of the term ==
What is today called "parental kidnapping," "international child abduction,", "parental child abduction" and "parental child trafficking" has existed as long as different legal jurisdictions and international borders have—though often under different names.  None of these names achieved the modern day broad acceptance of terms like international child abduction.  Lacking a common set of terminology or specifically designed laws to address the, at the time, poorly defined problem, researchers on the history of cross-border child abduction must search for terms like "custodial interference," "contempt of child custody orders," "legal kidnapping"  or, in cases where children were viewed more as property than as individual subjects of rights, name variations on theft, child-maintenance debt and smuggling, among others.&lt;ref name="pkpapers"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thepkpapers.com/

Lawmakers struggled to typify and discuss '''international child abduction''' and discussions at the [[Hague Conference on Private International Law]] noted that, what some were referring to with variations on "legal kidnapping," was an oxymoron since that which is legal cannot be kidnapping and that which is kidnapping cannot be legal. The response to these concerns was the coining of the term "international child abduction."  The terms first prominent use was in the title of the 1980 [[Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction]]. The term is not, however, used anywhere in the actual text of the convention itself in preference of the more technical terms "wrongful removal" or "wrongful retention" which were better suited for describing the mechanics of the Convention's system.&lt;ref name="HACText"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hcch.net/index_en.php?act=conventions.text&amp;cid=24|title=Hague Abduction Convention text |publisher=Hcch.net |date= |accessdate=2010-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The use of the term is now widespread in international law.&lt;ref name="Dyer paper"&gt;{{cite web

==Internationalization of family law==
In all family law disputes a determination must be made as to which legal systems and laws should be applied to the dispute. This question becomes much more complicated when aspects, or parties, of the case occur in, or hail from, multiple legal jurisdictions.&lt;ref name="Dyer paper"/&gt;

Today's international family law norms were heavily influenced by the concepts of [[Domicile (law)|domicile]] and [[nationality]]. In Europe these ideas were refined during the nineteenth century by Italian politician, [[Pasquale Mancini]], who believed matters of personal status were to be governed by the nationality of the person. During the same period in the US and Latin America the prevailing principle was that jurisdiction over personal matters was determined by domicile which, in the Americas, was acquired immediately upon moving to a foreign jurisdiction even if neither citizenship nor nationality were acquired.&lt;ref name="Dyer paper"/&gt;

Starting in the late eighteenth century until the early 1920s a number of efforts were made to develop a series of international treaties governing international conflicts of law in Europe. Treaties that favored nationality as the determining jurisdictional factor either never got of the ground, were not widely signed or had substantial practical problems with countries renouncing them after signing. At the same time the inter-American system in Latin America produced the [[Bustamante Code]] of 1928 and the [[Montevideo Convention]]s of 1939 and 1940. Of particular note in these later Conventions was the introduction of a definition of "domicile" that started with a reference to the "habitual residence" for civil status. Lessons learned in prior efforts to create successful multilateral treaties culminated in a number of successful treaties in the mid-1900s, such as the 1961 Convention on the Protection of Minors, the New York Convention of 1956 on the Recovery Abroad of Maintenance drafted under the auspices of the [[United Nations]], and the [[Hague Convention of 1961 concerning the powers of authorities and the law applicable in respect of the protection of minors]] ("1961 Convention.") &lt;ref name="Dyer paper"/&gt;

The 1961 Convention brought an innovation in terminology by creating a compromise between advocates of "nationality" as the determining factor for jurisdiction and advocates for the modern fact-centric model of "habitual residence."  It also included expanded language to encompass both judicial and administrative authorities in response to the [[Boll case]], in which Sweden claimed its [[public law|public administrative law]] was exempt from the [[Hague Convention of 1902 relating to the settlement of guardianship of minors|1902 Convention on the Guardianship of minors]] because it only governed domestic private judicial law and not public administrative law. The 1961 Convention also emphasized the concept of the "interests of the child" as a basis for authorities of the child's nationality to overrule the authorities of the child's habitual residence. Of particularly special note, the drafters of the 1961 Convention expressly considered a provision addressing the removal of a child from their habitual residence with an intent to evade rightful jurisdiction—primarily for child custody reasons. This first attempt to codify international child abduction failed due to an inability to agree on a definition or manner of describing the phenomenon, with a number of countries that adhered to the principle of nationality regulating personal child and family law unable to classify their nationals removing children from foreign countries to their home state as fraudulent evasion.&lt;ref name="Dyer paper"/&gt;

In actual cases of international child abduction, this lack of a specific provision on child abduction in the 1961 treaty resulted in countries regularly interpreting the "habitual residence" concept of the Convention in a manner that allowed parents to take children to a foreign country and immediately acquire "habitual residence."  This allowed judicial [[forum shopping]] and created [[perverse incentive]]s for removing children from their homes to foreign jurisdictions in order to game the family law system and obtain a more favorable custodial outcome than could be gained in the jurisdiction of the child's home.&lt;ref name="Dyer paper"/&gt;

In the 1970s, dissatisfaction with these results led to efforts to create conventions on the foreign recognition and enforcement of judgments to make it harder for courts to favor a parent solely because that parent is a national suing in his or her home state. Canada also proposed that the [[Hague Conference on Private International Law|Hague Conference]] work on a Convention to address what it termed "legal kidnapping." The Hague received Canada's request enthusiastically and, inspired by a Swiss proposal originally submitted at the Council of Europe in 1976 coined a new term in international family law – "international child abduction."&lt;ref name="Dyer paper"/&gt;  Although the problem of international child abduction was well understood, finding a way to address the problem in practice was exceedingly difficult, but the Swiss proposal had a solution that was elegant in its simplicity. Why not simply restore the ''status quo ante''?&lt;ref name="Dyer paper"/&gt;

In 1980 the [[Hague Conference on Private International Law|Hague Conference]] drafted a convention to address the problem of international child abduction: the [[Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction]] – commonly referred to as the [[Abduction Convention]]. The Swiss idea of restoring the ''status quo ante'' after a "wrongful removal" or "wrongful retention" became a mainstay of the Abduction Convention. Under the convention, an application could be made for the return of a child who had been wrongfully removed or retained so long as the applicant possessed rights of custody, and provided that those rights were being "actually exercised" at the time of the abduction. The concept of "actually exercised" in reference to custodial rights itself was an innovation in terminology. Having met these requirements a child was to be returned "forthwith" except in exceptional circumstances.&lt;ref name="HACText"/&gt;

Inspired by the [[Hague Evidence Convention]] and the [[Hague Service Convention]]'s of 1965 and 1970, the Abduction Convention required the establishment of a single [[Central Authority]] in each country that would handle two-way communications with domestic courts, administrative agencies and foreign central authorities. Furthermore, each central authority was required to take "any and all actions" to secure the goals of the treaty and cooperate with other central authorities to do the same. All of these new obligations emphasized the need for international cooperation amongst state parties in achieving the objectives of the convention.&lt;ref name="Dyer paper"/&gt;

=== The United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child ===
{{Main|Convention on the Rights of the Child}}

Established in 1989 the '''Convention on the Rights of the Child''' reflected the growing international consensus that children be viewed as a subject of rights and not merely as an object of rights or of protective action. The [[UNCRC]] roused an unprecedented response with 187 countries ratifying it within seven years forming an essential backdrop in international children's law. Article 11 of the Convention explicitly requires State Parties to combat the illicit transfer and retention of children and promote the conclusion of bilateral or multilateral agreements or accession to existing agreements that do so, Article 35 stipulates that "States Parties shall take all appropriate national, bilateral and multilateral measures to prevent the abduction, sale or traffic of children for any purpose or in any form."&lt;ref name="Dyer paper"/&gt;

=== The Hague Convention on Jurisdiction, Applicable Law, Recognition, Enforcement and Cooperation ===
{{Main|Hague Convention 1996}}

The 1996 '''Convention on Jurisdiction, Applicable Law, Recognition, Enforcement and Co-operation in respect of Parental Responsibility and Measures''' is the third of the modern [[Hague Convention 1996|Hague Conventions]] on international family law, following in the footsteps of the [[Hague Abduction Convention|Abduction Convention]] and the [[Hague Adoption Convention|Adoption Convention]]. It is much broader in scope than the first two conventions and covers a wide range of civil measures related to the protection of children including: orders concerning parental responsibility and contact, public measures of protection or care, matters of legal representation and the protection of children's property.

The Convention has uniform rules determining which country's authorities are competent to take the necessary measures of protection. The Convention also determines which country's laws are to be applied and provides for the recognition and enforcement of measures taken in one Contracting State in all the other Contracting States. The co-operation provisions of the Convention provide the basic framework for the exchange of information and the necessary degree of collaboration between administrative authorities in the Contracting States. Reflecting an ever-increasing emphasis on the need for international cooperation as an essential element in the success of these measures the Convention has a full chapter on cooperation consisting of eleven articles.&lt;ref name="Dyer paper"/&gt;

Although initially slow to gain support and plagued with political problems, the number of states acceding to it has begun to grow.

== Impact on society, families and children ==
[[File:Report on the Compliance with the Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction (2007 edition - front cover).jpg|thumb|175px|alt=2007 Report Cover|Cover of a US report on International Child Abduction (2007)]]

As the result of the harmful effects on children, parental kidnapping has been characterized as a form of child abuse and an extreme form of [[parental alienation]].  Abducted children suffer emotionally and sometimes physically at the hands of their abducting parents. Many are told the other parent is dead or has abandoned them. Uprooted from their entire life, home, family and friends, abducted children are often even given new names by their abductors and instructed to hide their real names or where they used to live.  Generally the abductor avoids mentioning the victim parent and waits for time to erase difficult questions, such as "When can we see mom/dad again?". These children become hostages.  It is beyond their comprehension that a parent who truly cares and loves them cannot discover their whereabouts.  Childhood cannot be recaptured.  Abductions rob a child of their sense of history, intimacy, values and morals, self-awareness, opportunity of knowing one's beginnings and the love and contact of extended family—a loss virtually no child possesses the ability to protect themselves against.

Huntington (1982) lists some of the deleterious effects of abduction on child victims:

1.  	Depression;&lt;br/&gt;
2.  	Loss of community;&lt;br/&gt;
3.  	Loss of stability, security, and trust;&lt;br/&gt;
4.  	Excessive fearfulness, even of ordinary occurrences;&lt;br/&gt;
5.  	Loneliness;&lt;br/&gt;
6.  	Anger;&lt;br/&gt;
7.  	Helplessness;&lt;br/&gt;
8.  	Disruption in identity formation; and&lt;br/&gt;
9.  	Fear of abandonment.

Many of these effects can be subsumed by the problems relevant to [[reactive attachment disorder]], stress, fear of abandonment, [[learned helplessness]], and guilt.

The extended support systems of abducting and victim parents can also become part of the dispute.  Believing primarily one side of the abduction story, family, friends, and professionals in each parents individual country may lose their objectivity. As a result, protective concerns expressed by the abandoned parent may be viewed as undue criticism, interference, and histrionics preventing the victim parent from effectively relieving the trauma imposed on their innocent child by the abduction.&lt;ref name="child abuse"/&gt;

== Mediation in child abduction cases ==
{{unreferenced section|date=June 2012}}

Mediation is a process during which abductors and the left behind family, assisted by mediator(s), attempt to resolve conflicts independent of the judicial system. Mediators create a constructive atmosphere for discussions and ensure fair dealings between parents. The mediators do not make decisions; instead, they confine themselves to assisting the parties in working out for themselves a fair and sensible solution to their problems. More specifically, the mediation can address not only the child’s primary residence, but also the child’s contact with both parents, visitation arrangements, agreements concerning the child’s maintenance, schooling, further education, bi-cultural and bi-lingual upbringing, necessary arrangements for financial support etc.

Mediation can be helpful in international child abduction cases.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.reunite.org/edit/files/Library%20-%20reunite%20Publications/Mediation%20research%20report.pdf] Reunite research 2012
&lt;/ref&gt; In the context of mediation families can deal with the question of return and also find solutions to other issues relating to their children.

== Legal justifications for abduction ==

International law has generally recognized that there may be extenuating circumstances where a child abduction may have been necessary or justifiable due to extenuating circumstances. The [[Hague Convention of 1902 relating to the settlement of guardianship of minors|1902 Convention on the Guardianship of minors]] limited such considerations to strictly emergency situations. Starting with the [[1924 Declaration on the Rights of the Child]] and the [[Declaration of the Rights of the Child|1959 United Nations Declaration on the Rights of the Child]] there was a growing recognition at the international level of the shift in nation's domestic laws away from parental authority and towards an emphasis on protecting the child, even from their own parents.&lt;ref name="Dyer paper"/&gt;  This foreshadowed the 1989 [[UN Convention on the Rights of the Child]] and led to the establishment of exceptional circumstances in Article 13 of the [[Hague Abduction Convention]] where the removal of children would not be considered child abduction and allow the child to remain in their new country.&lt;ref name="HACText"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Perez-Vera Report"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hcch.e-vision.nl/upload/expl28.pdf |title=Explanatory Report |publisher=Hcch.net |author=Elisa Perez-Vera|accessdate=2010-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Abduction Convention: "Grave risks of harm" and "intolerable situations" ===
The principal purpose of the Abduction Convention is to cause the prompt return of a child to his or her "habitual residence."  In certain exceptional cases under Article 13b, the court's mandatory return obligation is changed to a discretionary obligation, specifically, "the judicial or administrative authority of the requested State is not bound to order the return of the child if the person, institution or other body which opposes its return establishes that there is a ''grave risk that his or her return would expose the child to physical or psychological harm or otherwise place the child in an intolerable situation.''"  It is important to note that the duty to return a child is not abrogated by a finding under Art. 13(b) but merely changes from mandatory to discretionary. Since the general intent of the Convention is to cause the return of a child to his or her "habitual residence," unless there are some powerful and compelling reasons otherwise the court is normally and routinely expected to exercise its discretion and return the child to his or her "habitual residence".

In the primary source of interpretation for the Convention, the Explanatory Report, Professor E. Perez-Vera noted the following:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"it would seem necessary to underline the fact that the three types of exception to the rule concerning the return of the child must be applied only so far as they go and no further. This implies above all that they are to be interpreted in a restrictive fashion if the Convention is not to become a dead letter. In fact, the Convention as a whole rests upon the unanimous rejection of this phenomenon of illegal child removals and upon the conviction that the best way to combat them at an international level is to refuse to grant them legal recognition. The practical application of this principle requires that the signatory States be convinced that they belong, despite their differences, to the same legal community within which the authorities of each State acknowledge that the authorities of one of them – those of the child's habitual residence – are in principle best placed to decide upon questions of custody and access. As a result, a systematic invocation of the said exceptions, substituting the forum chosen by the abductor for that of the child's residence, would lead to the collapse of the whole structure of the Convention by depriving it of the spirit of mutual confidence which is its inspiration."
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
In spite of the spirit and intent of the Convention as conveyed by the Convention itself and further reinforced by the Perez-Vera report, Article 13b is frequently used by abductors as a vehicle to litigate the child's [[best interests]] or [[child custody|custody]]. Although Article 13(b) inquiries are not intended to deal with issues or factual questions appropriate for custody proceedings, many countries use article 13b to request psychological profiles, detailed evaluations of parental fitness, evidence concerning lifestyle and the nature and quality of relationships.&lt;ref name="Grave risk and Art. 13b"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hiltonhouse.com/articles/Art_13(b)_limit.txt |title=The Limitations on Art. 13(b) of The Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction done at the Hague on 25 Oct 1980 |author=William M. Hilton |year=1997|accessdate=2009-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; These misinterpretations of the Abduction Convention's exceptions have rendered the Convention largely ineffective in accomplishing its objectives. The ''best interests'' of a child, which is explicitly never mentioned in the Convention, is an essentially subjective standard that judges often use to facilitate foreign nations' manipulation of the treaty and create a pretext for discretionary decisions. This discretion often takes the form of gender, cultural and national biases. The result is substantive non-compliance with the Abduction Convention.&lt;ref name="Who's Best Interest"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allbusiness.com/legal/1001334-1.html |title=Whose best interest?

=== Domestic violence ===
[[File:Grandville Cent Proverbes page69.png|thumb|150px|alt=Domestic Violence|Domestic Violence]]
{{see also|Domestic violence}}
At the time the [[Hague Abduction Convention]] was drafted domestic violence was never explicitly considered as an [[affirmative defense]] for child abduction, although it may be brought as a defense under Article 13, if "there is a grave risk that his or her return would expose the child to physical or psychological harm or otherwise place the child in an intolerable situation." Article 13 supposed that the child's primary caretaker would abduct the child to escape the domestic violence of a non-custodial parent. At the time of the Conventions drafting, [[joint custody]] laws were rare. One parent was usually both the custodial parent and primary caretaker while the other, non-custodial parent had rights of access. The move towards joint custody laws conferred both the parent who acted as the primary caretaker and their ex-partner with custodial rights and, by extension, a right to request the return of children wrongfully removed from their place of habitual residence. In addition to not accounting for a shift in child custody law towards shared parenting and joint custody, according to Weiner, the framers of the Convention also did little to account for the motivation for abducting a child, generally assuming that all abductions were harmful to children; however, the child's primary caretaker may be fleeing with a child to protect himself or herself from a dangerous domestic situation.&lt;ref name="DV and ICA"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lclac.org/FordhamLawReview.htm |title=International Child Abduction and the Escape from Domestic Violence|publisher=Fordham Law Review |year=2000 |author=Merle H.

'''Jazz Bilzen''' was an annual multi-day open air jazz and pop [[Music festival|festival]] that took place from 1965 to 1981 in the Belgian city of [[Bilzen]]. Jazz Bilzen was the first festival on the continent where jazz and pop music were brought together. For this reason, Jazz Bilzen is sometimes called the "mother of all European festivals". 

==History==
Like the [[National Jazz and Blues Festival]] in the United Kingdom, and the Jazz Festival International in [[Comblain-la-Tour]], which were paradigms, Bilzen started out solely as a jazz festival. Pretty soon however blues, skiffle, beat, folk and soul, in the end even punk, reggae and new wave, came to be incorporated as well. Initially ''[[HUMO|Humo]]'', a popular Belgian weekly magazine, was the main sponsor. After several years, they withdrew because they got fed up with the security branch and the riots they caused. The Festival organisation now had to find different investors (such as Coca-Cola, Ford, provincial newspapers), which was indicative of the beginning of the end. From the 1980s onwards, the festival was superseded by Torhout-Werchter, which has now become [[Rock Werchter]].

&lt;!-- EDITORS NOTE: Please do not change the first paragraph without prior consensus, see [[Talk:Occupation of the Rhineland]]. Thank you. --&gt;The '''Occupation of the Rhineland''' from 1 December 1918 until 30 June 1930 was a consequence of the [[collapse of the Imperial German Army]] in 1918. Despite [[German Empire|Germany]] proving victorious on the [[Eastern Front (World War I)|eastern front]] following the [[Russian Revolution]], the military high command had failed to prevent the continuing erosion of morale, both domestically and in the army. Despite transferring veteran troops from the eastern front to fight on the [[Western Front (World War I)|western front]], the [[spring offensive]] was a failure and following the outbreak of the [[German Revolution of 1918|German Revolution]] the [[Council of the People's Deputies|Germany's provisional government]] was obliged to agree to the terms of the [[Armistice of 11 November 1918|1918 armistice]]. This included accepting that the troops of the victorious powers [[Military occupation|occupied]] the [[Left Bank of the Rhine|left bank of the Rhine]] and four right bank "[[Bridgehead|bridgeheads]]" with 30 kilometers radius around [[Cologne]], [[Koblenz]], [[Mainz]] and {{convert|10|km|mi|0}} radius around [[Kehl]]. Furthermore, the left bank of the [[Rhine]] and a {{convert|50|km|mi|0}} wide strip east of the Rhine was declared a [[Demilitarized zone|demilitarized zone]]. The [[Treaty of Versailles]] repeated these provisions, but limited the presence of the foreign troops to fifteen years until 1934. The purpose of the occupation was on the one hand to give [[French Third Republic|France]] security against a renewed German attack, and on the other to serve as a guarantee for [[World War I reparations|reparations obligations]]. After this was apparently achieved with the [[Young Plan]], the occupation of the Rhineland was prematurely ended on 30 June 1930. The administration of occupied Rhineland was under the jurisdiction of the [[Inter-Allied Rhineland High Commission]] with its seat at the Upper Presidium of the Rhine Province in Koblenz.&lt;!-- EDITORS NOTE: Please do not change the first paragraph without prior consensus, see [[Talk:Occupation of the Rhineland]].

This consisted of 20,000 soldiers{{fact|date=June 2018}} (five divisions)&lt;ref&gt;Pawley (2008) p. 39&lt;/ref&gt; with its headquarters at [[Aachen]], and with its troops stationed in [[Krefeld]].&lt;ref&gt;Pawley (2008) p. 41&lt;/ref&gt; They were commanded by [[Armand Huyghé]].

===British Army of the Rhine===
The [[British Army]] entered German territory on 3 December 1918.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.firstworldwar.com/source/rhineoccupation_gibbs.htm Philip Gibbs on the Allied Occupation of the Rhineland, December 1918] accessed 11 September 2010
&lt;/ref&gt; The [[British Army of the Rhine]] was established as the occupying force in March 1919. Based at [[Cologne]], they published ''[[The Cologne Post]]''.

===French Army of the Rhine===
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 102-08810, Koblenz, Französische Soldaten am Deutsche Eck.jpg|thumb|left|French troops at the [[Ehrenbreitstein Fortress|Ehrenbreitstein]]]]
The French [[Eighth Army (France)|Eighth]] and [[Tenth Army (France)|Tenth]] armies originally constituted the French forces involved in the occupation. The Eighth Army was commanded by General [[Augustin Gérard]] and occupied [[the Palatinate]]. The Tenth Army was commanded by General [[Charles Mangin]] and was responsible for the rest of the French zone from its headquarters in [[Mainz]]. 

On 21 October 1919, they were combined to form the French Army of the Rhine.

In 1919 France stationed between 25,000 and 40,000 [[French Colonial Forces|French colonial soldiers]] in the Rhineland.&lt;ref&gt;Wigger (2010) p. 35&lt;/ref&gt; Some German women married African soldiers from the occupying forces, while others had children by them out of [[Marriage|wedlock]] (hence the disparaging label "[[Rhineland Bastards]]")&lt;ref&gt;[[Tina Campt]], ''Other Germans: Black Germans and the Politics of Race, Gender, and Memory in the Third Reich'' (University of Michigan Press, 2004), p. 50 ff.&lt;/ref&gt; and were considered by right-wing Germans to constitute a public disgrace.&lt;ref&gt;Julia Roos, "Women's Rights, Nationalist Anxiety, and the 'Moral' Agenda in the Early Weimar Republic: Revisiting the 'Black Horror' Campaign against France's African Occupation Troops". ''Central European History'', 42 (September 2009), 473–508.
&lt;/ref&gt; General [[Henry Tureman Allen]] reported to the [[United States Secretary of State|US Secretary of State]] that from the start of the occupation until June 1920 there were 66 cases of formal accusations against colored colonial troops, out of which there were 28 convictions, and admits there were many more unreported cases.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url = https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1921/02/20/112671939.pdf|title = Finds Negro troops orderly on Rhine|last = |first = |date = 20 February  1921|work = The New York Times|access-date = |via = |quote = Undoubtedly many cases have occurred where many girls or women have been assaulted by of the French colored Colonial troops...cases which were not included in official figures...natural desire to keep out...}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite these occasional cases, "the wholesale atrocities by French negro Colonial troops alleged in the German press, such as the alleged abductions, followed by rape, mutilation, murder and concealment of the bodies of the victims are false and intended as political propaganda".&lt;ref&gt;[https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1921/02/20/112671939.pdf "FINDS NEGRO TROOPS ORDERLY ON RHINE; General Allen Reports Charges Are German Propaganda, 'Especially for America{{'"}}], ''[[The New York Times]]'', 20 February 1921&lt;/ref&gt;

French occupation of Frankfurt occurred from 6 April to 17 May 1920. On the second day nine civilians were shot by Moroccan troops in an incident outside the [[Hauptwache (Frankfurt am Main)|Hauptwache]]. This incident was used to launch a racist campaign against the French use of [[Troupes coloniales|colonial troops]], linking the incident with allegations of wide spread assaults by [[Black people|Black]] soldiers in the French occupation army on local women&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; including accusations of systemic [[rape]] and other atrocities targeting the German civilian population and attributed mainly to [[Senegalese Tirailleurs]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://ethiopiques.refer.sn/article.php3?id_article=1014 LES TIRAILLEURS SENEGALAIS ET L’ANTHROPOLOGIE COLONIALE UN LITIGE FRANCO-ALLEMAND AUX LENDEMAINS DE LA PREMIERE GUERRE MONDIALE], Hans-Jürgen Lüsebrink&lt;/ref&gt; The events resulted in a widespread campaign by the German [[right-wing]] press,  which dubbed them as "The Black Shame" (''Die schwarze Schande'' or ''Die schwarze Schmach'') and depicted them as a form of French humiliation of the German nation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ipr.univ-paris1.fr/spip.php?article109 La « Honte Noire ».

{{main|Occupation of the Ruhr}}
In 1923, in response to German failure to pay reparations under the [[Treaty of Versailles]], France and Belgium [[Occupation of the Ruhr|occupied the industrial Ruhr]] area of Germany, most of which lies across the river on the east bank of the Rhine, until 1925. Many Germans were killed during civil disobedience protests. e.g. against dismissal of German officials.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = https://newspaperarchive.com/us/montana/anaconda/anaconda-standard/1923/02-10/page-6?tag=germans+killed+in+ruhr&amp;rtserp=tags/?pep=germans-killed-in-ruhr|title = Anaconda Standard|last = |first = |date = 1923-02-10|work = |access-date = |via = |quote = Twenty Germans  were  said to  have been killed and  several  French  soldiers  wounded  when a mob at  Rapoch attempted  to prevent  the  expulsion of  one hundred  officials.

===American forces in Germany (1918–1923)===
The [[United States]] originally provided around 240,000 men in nine veteran divisions, nearly a third of the total occupying force. General [[John J. Pershing]], commander of the [[American Expeditionary Forces|American Expeditionary Force]] (A. E. F.) on the Western Front, established [[United States Army Central|Third Army]] for the purpose, under the command of Major General [[Joseph T. Dickman]].&lt;ref&gt;Pawley (2008) pp. 32–33&lt;/ref&gt; Third Army was assigned to occupy the northern sector of the Coblenz bridgehead. By July 1919, Third Army was disbanded, having been reduced to about 8,400 men, and was renamed American Forces in Germany (AF in G). AF in G withdrew on 24 January 1923, vacating [[Ehrenbreitstein Fortress|Ehrenbreitstein]], which was promptly occupied by the French.
===Siamese Expeditionary Forces===
The [[Siamese Expeditionary Forces]] also participated in the occupation until 1919 with their troops being stationed in [[Neustadt an der Weinstraße]], located in the French area.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18964">'''Playing For Change''' is a [[multimedia]] music project, co-founded in 2002 by American music engineer/producer Mark Johnson and film producer/philanthropist [[Whitney Ann Kroenke|Whitney Kroenke]], that seeks to inspire, connect, and bring peace to the world through music. Playing For Change also created a separate [[non-profit organization]] called the Playing For Change Foundation, which builds music and art schools for children around the world.

== Origin ==
Playing For Change was born in 2002 as a shared vision between co-founders, Mark Johnson and [[Whitney Kroenke Burditt|Whitney Kroenke]], to hit the streets of America with a mobile recording studio and cameras in search of inspiration and the heartbeat of the people. Producers Johnson and Enzo Buono traveled around the world to places including [[New Orleans]], [[Barcelona]], [[South Africa]], [[India]], [[Nepal]], the [[Middle East]] and [[Ireland]]. Using mobile recording equipment, the duo recorded local musicians performing the same song, interpreted in their own style. Among the artists participating or openly involved in the project are [[Vusi Mahlasela]], [[Louis Mhlanga]], [[Clarence Bekker]], [[David Guido Pietroni]], Tal Ben Ari (Tula), [[Bono]], [[Keb' Mo']], [[David Broza]], [[Manu Chao]], [[Grandpa Elliott]], [[Keith Richards]], Toots Hibbert from [[Toots &amp; the Maytals]], [[Taj Mahal (musician)|Taj Mahal]] and [[Stephen Marley (musician)|Stephen Marley]]. This resulted in the award-winning documentary ''A Cinematic Discovery of Street Musicians''.

In 2005, Mark Johnson was walking in [[Santa Monica, California]], when he heard the voice of Roger Ridley (now deceased) singing "Stand By Me." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rogerridleybluesman.com/|title=Roger Ridley - Roger Ridley/street performer - HOME|work=rogerridleybluesman.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Roger had so much soul and conviction in his voice, and Mark approached him about performing "Stand By Me" as a Song Around The World. Roger agreed, and when Mark returned with recording equipment and cameras he asked Roger, "With a voice like yours, why are you singing on the streets?" Roger replied, "Man I’m in the Joy business, I come out to be with the people." Ever since that day, the Playing For Change crew has traveled the world recording and filming musicians, creating Songs Around The World, and building a global family.

Creating Songs Around The World inspired the PFC crew to unite many of the greatest musicians they met throughout their journey through the creation of the Playing For Change Band. These musicians come from many different countries and cultures, but through music they speak the same language. The PFC Band is now touring the world and spreading the message of love and hope to audiences everywhere.

The founders of Playing For Change created the Playing For Change Foundation, a separate 501(c)3 nonprofit organization dedicated to building music and art schools for children around the world, and creating hope and inspiration for the future of our planet.

== PFC Online Global Community ==
PFC videos have exceeded an estimated 500 million online views, continuing to grow steadily through active &amp; dedicated community members from 195 countries.

In 2011, the Playing For Change Foundation established an annual Playing For Change Day.&lt;ref name="playingforchangeday.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://playingforchangeday.org/about|title=Playing for Change Day - September 24th, 2016|work=playingforchangeday.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; The goal of Playing For Change Day is to "unite a global community through the power of music to affect positive social change".&lt;ref name="playingforchangeday.org"/&gt; In 2012, the PFC Day consisted of over 330 events across 52 countries and helped raise over $150,000 for the Playing For Change Foundation, and in 2014, PFC Day saw over 400 events in 60 countries.&lt;ref name="playingforchangeday.org"/&gt;  It is held on the Saturday nearest the United Nations' [[International Day of Peace]], which takes place each year on Sept. 21. In 2015, Playing for Change Day was celebrated on September 19. The sixth-annual Playing for Change Day was on September 24, 2016.&lt;ref name="playingforchangeday.org" /&gt;

In 2013, the Foundation introduced the Stand by Me Scholarship program, allowing people to sponsor a child to learn music for an entire year. Scholarships are need-based and are given to children who could not participate otherwise. Donors can either make a one-time gift to fund a student, or set up monthly contributions.

{{Criminal law}}
'''Possession of stolen goods''' is a crime in which an individual has bought, been given, or acquired stolen goods.

In many jurisdictions, if an individual has accepted possession of goods or property and knew they were stolen, then the individual is typically charged with a misdemeanor or felony, depending on the value of the stolen goods. If the individual did not know the goods were stolen, then the goods are returned to the owner and the individual is not prosecuted. However, there are often exceptions, due to the difficulty of proving or disproving an individual's knowledge that the goods were stolen.

==Nature of offence by country==

===Canada===

The [[Criminal Code (Canada)|Criminal Code]] specifies three offences:

:* '''Possession of property obtained by crime''' (s. 354)&lt;ref&gt;[http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/C-46/page-167.html#h-100 ''Criminal Code'', s. 354]&lt;/ref&gt;
:* '''Trafficking in property obtained by crime''' (ss. 355.2)&lt;ref name="CCtraffic"&gt;[http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/C-46/page-168.html ''Criminal Code'', ss. 355.1 - 355.4] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120329034204/http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/C-46/page-168.html |date=2012-03-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
:* '''Possession of property obtained by crime for the purposes of trafficking''' (ss. 355.4)&lt;ref name = "CCtraffic"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

The basic definition for the possession offence (which is almost identical in wording for the trafficking offences) is as follows:

{{quote|
'''354'''. (1) Every one commits an offence who has in his possession any property or thing or any proceeds of any property or thing knowing that all or part of the property or thing or of the proceeds was obtained by or derived directly or indirectly from
:(a) the commission in Canada of an offence punishable by indictment; or
:(b) an act or omission anywhere that, if it had occurred in Canada, would have constituted an offence punishable by indictment.
|}}

Where the value of the property is greater than $5,000, the maximum punishment on indictment is 10 years for possession only, and 14 years if related to trafficking. Otherwise, the maximum on indictment is two years and five years respectively, or alternatively punishment by summary conviction. (ss 355 and 355.5)
===United Kingdom===
{{redirect|Handling|the turning characteristics of land vehicles|Car handling}}
'''Handling stolen goods''' is the name of a statutory offence in [[England and Wales]] and [[Northern Ireland]]. It takes place after a theft or other dishonest acquisition is completed and may be committed by a [[fence (criminal)|fence]] or other person who helps the thief to realise the value of the stolen goods. It replaces the offence of [[receiving stolen goods]] under section 33 of the [[Larceny Act 1916]].

====England and Wales====
This offence is created by section 22(1) of the [[Theft Act 1968]] which provides:
{{quote|text=A person handles stolen goods if (otherwise than in the course of stealing), knowing or believing them to be stolen goods he dishonestly receives the goods, or dishonestly undertakes or assists in their retention, removal, disposal or realisation by or for the benefit of another person, or if he arranges to do so.&lt;ref name=TA68&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.statutelaw.gov.uk/content.aspx?ActiveTextDocId=1204238 |title=Theft Act 1968 |accessdate=27 January 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090317010845/http://www.statutelaw.gov.uk/content.aspx?activeTextDocId=1204238 |archivedate=17 March 2009 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

'''Stolen goods''': This term means property stolen anywhere, as long as the theft amounted to an offence where committed.&lt;ref name = TA68/&gt; It includes any proceeds of that property, including money for which it has been sold, and anything bought with those proceeds.&lt;ref&gt;by sections 24(2)(a) and (b)&lt;/ref&gt; However, property which has been returned to the original owner, or otherwise lawful custody, is no longer regarded as stolen, by section 24(3). This may create difficulties, as in [[Haughton v. Smith]]. It is not necessary that the property be "stolen" in a limited sense; section 24(4) of the Act specifically extends the scope to property obtained by fraud or [[blackmail]]. However, it is also implicit in the definition of offences such as burglary or robbery that handling may apply to the proceeds of these offences.

'''Dealing''': The offence of handling is drafted widely enough to criminalise any dishonest dealing with property which has been come by dishonestly; for example, the original thief may also be convicted of a subsequent handling if he later arranges its sale.&lt;ref name = E&amp;Q/&gt; A codification of the methods of dealing has been suggested as
#receiving stolen goods,
#arranging to receive them,
#undertaking the keeping, removing, disposing of or realisation of stolen goods by or for the benefit of another person, or helping with any of those things, or
#arranging to do any of the things in (3).&lt;ref name = E&amp;Q/&gt;
This makes the [[actus reus]] of handling very wide; for example, in R v Kanwar,&lt;ref&gt;[1982] 2 All E R 528, CA 161&lt;/ref&gt; a man had brought stolen goods into the marital home, and his wife, the defendant, had lied to the police; it was held that this constituted "assisting in the retention" of those goods.

'''Knowledge or belief''': The accused's knowledge or belief as to the nature of the goods is crucial, but has been a constant source of interpretive problems. Either may be based on what the thief says or some other positive information, but belief is less than knowledge and more than mere suspicion. In R v Hall [1985] 81 [[Criminal Appeal Reports|Cr App R]] 260, it was held that, per [[Boreham, J.]],
{{quote|Belief.. is something short of knowledge. It may be said to be the state of mind of a person who says to himself, "I cannot say I know for certain that these goods are stolen, but there can be no other reasonable conclusion in the light of all the circumstances, in the light of all that I have heard and seen".}} He went on to distinguish the case where a defendant has said {{quote|text="I suspect that these goods may be stolen, but it may be on the other hand that they are not"}}

The situation is further complicated by the concept of recklessness or wilful blindness to the circumstances; either will be treated as a belief that the goods are stolen. Thus, ''suspicion'' will be converted into belief when the facts are so obvious that belief may safely be [[imputation (law)|imputed]]. So if the defendant bought goods in a pub or a dark alley for a fraction of their true value and it is clear that identification marks or serial numbers have been erased, any denial of belief by the defendant would not be credible.{{Fact|date=January 2009}}

'''[[Dishonestly]]''': The ''[[mens rea]]'' of the offence is the same as for theft (see ''[[R v Ghosh]]'' 75 Cr App R 154.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWCA/Crim/1982/2.html R v Ghosh 75 Cr App R 154]&lt;/ref&gt;).

There was at one time an issue of impossibility in that the defendant may be dishonest and intend to handle goods (which he believes to be stolen) but which are not in fact stolen. The [[House of Lords]] ruled in [[Haughton v. Smith]] (1973) that where goods previously stolen have been reduced into lawful possession, not only can they not be handled, but there can be no attempt to handle them. Since then, section 1 of the [[Criminal Attempts Act 1981]] confirms that such a defendant can be convicted.

Laundering is now an offence under ss.327/9 and 340(3)(b) Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 and the distinction with handling depends on whether the defendant's intention was to launder the proceeds of crime or merely to assist a thief. Laundering covers large amounts of money in a series of transactions over time when the defendant knows or suspects that the assets which he has concealed, acquired, used, possessed, or in respect of which he has entered into an arrangement which he knows or suspects facilitates the acquisition, retention, use or control of criminal property by or on behalf of another person, are the proceeds of criminal conduct (compare [[money laundering]]).{{fact|date=July 2018}}

Section 23&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.statutelaw.gov.uk/content.aspx?LegType=All+Legislation&amp;title=Theft+Act+1968&amp;searchEnacted=0&amp;extentMatchOnly=0&amp;confersPower=0&amp;blanketAmendment=0&amp;sortAlpha=0&amp;TYPE=QS&amp;PageNumber=1&amp;NavFrom=0&amp;parentActiveTextDocId=1204238&amp;ActiveTextDocId=1204270&amp;filesize=1907 Section 23] Theft Act 1968&lt;/ref&gt; of the 1968 Act creates an offence of "advertising rewards for the return of stolen goods".&lt;ref name = TA68/&gt; This prohibits public advertising for the return of such goods stating that "no questions will be asked", or offering immunity from prosecution to the returner, or stating that any monies paid for the goods will be reimbursed. This is a summary offence but is rarely prosecuted.{{Fact|date=January 2009}}

Handling stolen goods is triable [[either way]].&lt;ref&gt;The [[Magistrates' Courts Act 1980]], section 17(1) and Schedule 1, paragraph 28&lt;/ref&gt; A person guilty of handling stolen goods is liable, on [[conviction]] on indictment, to imprisonment for a term not exceeding fourteen years,&lt;ref&gt;The [[Theft Act 1968]], section 22(2)&lt;/ref&gt; or on [[summary conviction]] to imprisonment for a term not exceeding six months, or to a fine not exceeding the [[prescribed sum]], or to both.&lt;ref&gt;The [[Magistrates' Courts Act 1980]], section 32(1)&lt;/ref&gt;

The wording of Section 22 actually creates eighteen ways in which handling may be committed,&lt;ref name = E&amp;Q&gt;{{cite book | title = Criminal Law | last = Elliott | first = Catherine |author2=Frances Quinn | pages = 160 | publisher = [[Longman]] | isbn = 058242352X| year = 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; This may create a problem for prosecutors in that Rule 7 of the Criminal Procedure Rules 2005,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.opsi.gov.uk/si/si2005/20050384.htm#7 |title=Criminal Procedure Rules 2005 |accessdate=27 January 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061211171650/http://www.opsi.gov.uk/si/si2005/20050384.htm |archivedate=11 December 2006 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; and Rule 7 of the Indictments Rules 1971 provide that only a single offence may be charged in one information (in the Magistrates' Court) or in one count of an indictment (in the [[Crown Court]]). It can also be difficult to determine the meaning of "otherwise than in the course of stealing"; it was decided in R v Hale [1979] 1 Crim LR 596&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.a-level-law.com/caselibrary/R%20v%20HALE%20%5B1979%5D%201%20Crim%20LR%20596%20-%20CA.doc |title=R v Hale |accessdate=27 January 2009 }}{{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt; that the "appropriation" in theft may be a continuing act, so it may be difficult to determine whether a theft has been completed.
Apart from the apparent difficulties of specifying a charge that does not offend against the rule against duplicity, it has been said that "in practice almost anything a person does with stolen goods may be classified as a handling".&lt;ref name = E&amp;Q/&gt;

Section 27(3) of the Theft Act 1968 introduces a rare exception to the rule against admissibility of previous criminal conduct in the case of this offence. Evidence may be adduced (but only if handling is the only charge faced by the defendant) that the defendant (a) has been involved in similar conduct within the previous twelve months AND (b) has a previous conviction for handling within five years.&lt;ref name = TA68/&gt; This is to counter repeated defences of "innocent dealing" as may be put forward by dishonest [[pawnbroker]]s. If the defendant is facing other charges, evidence of previous bad character may be admissible under Section 98 of the Criminal Justice Act 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.cps.gov.uk/legal/s_to_u/theft_acts_incorporating_the_charging_standard/#_Other_Offences_under | title = Theft Acts, Incorporating the Charging Standard, CPS Guidance | accessdate = 27 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Northern Ireland====
This offence is created by [http://www.legislation.gov.uk/apni/1969/16/section/21 section 21(1)] of the [[Theft Act (Northern Ireland) 1969]].

====Scotland====
In [[Criminal Law (Consolidation) (Scotland) Act 1995|Scotland]], this crime is called '''reset'''.&lt;ref name=reset&gt;{{Citation
  | last = Criminal Law (Consolidation) (Scotland) Act 1995

===Republic of Ireland===
The offence of '''handling stolen property''' is created by [http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2001/en/act/pub/0050/sec0017.html#sec17 section 17(1)] of the [[Criminal Justice (Theft and Fraud Offences) Act, 2001]].

===United States===
In the [[United States]], '''Receipt of stolen property''' is a [[federal crime]] under {{UnitedStatesCode|18|2315}}, defined as knowingly receiving, concealing, or disposing of stolen property with a value of at least $5,000 that also constitutes [[interstate commerce]] (i.e., has been transported across state lines).

A person can be found guilty of that offense only if all of the following facts are proven:
* The person received or concealed or stored or disposed of items of stolen property.
* The items were moving as, or constituted a part of, interstate commerce.
* The items had a value in excess of $5,000.
* The person acted knowingly and willfully.

The [[government]] must prove [[beyond a reasonable doubt]] that the person either received, concealed, stored, sold, or disposed of the stolen property.

To be guilty of the offense, a person must know that the property had been stolen, but he need not know that it was moving as, or constituted a part of, interstate commerce. The term "interstate commerce" merely refers to the movement of property from one [[U.S. state]] into another; and it is sufficient if the property has recently moved interstate as a result of a transaction or a series of related transactions that have not been fully completed or consummated at the time of the person's acts as alleged.

All US states also have laws regarding receipt of stolen property; however, there usually is no minimum dollar amount in many jurisdictions, and, of course, the requirement in Federal law regarding interstate commerce does not apply. Also, in many states ([[Ohio]], for example), the burden to prove [[Intention (criminal law)|criminal intent]] is not as stringent or is nonexistent.&lt;ref name=ORC&gt;{{Citation
  | last = Ohio Revised Code
  | title = 2913.51 Receiving stolen property
  | url=http://codes.ohio.gov/orc/2913.51
  | accessdate = 2009-04-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This means that one can be charged with the crime - usually a minor degree of [[felony]] - even if the person did not know the item in question was stolen. In the Ohio case of ''State v. Awad'', the goods did not need to actually be stolen, just represented as such.&lt;ref name=awad&gt;{{cite court
  |litigants=State v. Awad
  |vol=164
  |reporter=Ohio App.3d
  |opinion=528
  |pinpoint=
  |court=Court of Appeals, First Appellate District of Ohio
  |date=2005
  |url=http://vlex.com/vid/state-v-awad-21664232?ix_resultado=46&amp;query%5Bct_resultados%5D=1901&amp;query%5Bfrase%5D=receiving+stolen+property+ohio&amp;query%5Blc_query%5D=texto%3A%28receiving+AND+stolen+AND+property+AND+ohio%29+OR+titulo%3A%28receiving+AND+stolen+AND+property+AND+ohio%29&amp;query%5Bpais_id%5D=US&amp;sort=score }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Receiving stolen property and possession of stolen property are treated as separate offenses in some jurisdictions. The distinguishing element is when the person knew that the property was stolen. If the person knew that the property was stolen at the time he received it, the crime is receiving stolen property. If the person did not know the property was stolen at the time she received it but found out after receiving possession, the crime is possession of stolen property.

The state must prove that the defendant received or possessed the property for a dishonest purpose. If, for example, the person acquired possession for the purpose of returning the property to its lawful owner, no crime has been committed.

The '''post-Soviet states''', also collectively known as the '''former Soviet Union''' ('''FSU''')&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://belfercenter.ksg.harvard.edu/publication/1805/managing_conflict_in_the_former_soviet_union.html|title=Managing Conflict in the Former Soviet Union: Russian and American Perspectives|date=30 October 1997|work=harvard.edu|accessdate=2 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; or '''former Soviet Republics''', and in Russian as the "'''near abroad'''" (discussed below) are the [[Sovereign state|states]] that emerged and re-emerged from the [[Soviet Union|Union of Soviet Socialist Republics]] in its [[dissolution of the Soviet Union|breakup]] in 1991, with [[Russia]] internationally recognised as the [[Succession of states|successor state]] to the Soviet Union after the [[Cold War]]. The three [[Baltic states]] were the first to declare their independence, between March and May 1990, claiming [[State continuity of the Baltic states|continuity from the original states]] that existed prior to their annexation by the Soviet Union in 1940.&lt;ref name="Elsuwege"&gt;{{cite book|last=Van Elsuwege|first=Peter|title=From Soviet Republics to Eu Member States: A Legal and Political Assessment of the Baltic States' Accession to the EU|series=Studies in EU External Relations|volume=1|year=2008|publisher=BRILL|isbn=9789004169456|page=xxii}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Estonia |last=Smith |first=David James |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=2001 |publisher=Routledge |location= |isbn=0-415-26728-5 |page=20 |pages= |url=https://books.google.com/?id=lx-UmTnLJv0C&amp;pg=PR20&amp;dq}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The remaining 12 republics all subsequently seceded.&lt;ref name="Elsuwege"/&gt; 12 of the 15 states, excluding the Baltic states, initially formed the [[Commonwealth of Independent States|CIS]] and most joined [[Collective Security Treaty Organization|CSTO]], while the Baltic states focused on [[European Union]] and [[NATO]] membership.

Several [[List of states with limited recognition|disputed states with varying degrees of recognition]] exist within the territory of the former Soviet Union: [[Transnistria]] in eastern [[Moldova]], [[Abkhazia]] and [[South Ossetia]] in northern [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] and [[Nagorno-Karabakh]] in southwestern [[Azerbaijan]]. Since 2014, the [[Donetsk People's Republic]] and [[Luhansk People's Republic]] in [[Eastern Ukraine]] have claimed independence. All of these unrecognised states except Nagorno-Karabakh depend on Russian armed support and financial aid. Nagorno-Karabakh is integrated to [[Armenia]], which also maintains close cooperation with [[Russia]]. Prior to the [[Annexation of Crimea to the Russian Federation|annexation of Crimea]] to Russia in March 2014, which is not recognized by most countries, it briefly declared itself an independent state.

In the political language of [[Russia]] and some other post-Soviet states, the '''near abroad''' refers to the newly independent republics (other than Russia itself) which emerged after the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]]. "'''Near abroad'''" became more widely used in [[English language|English]], usually to assert Russia's right to have major influence in the region,&lt;ref name=nyt&gt;{{cite web|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C07EED81E39F931A15756C0A962958260|title= ON LANGUAGE; The Near Abroad|accessdate=2008-04-18|author=[[William Safire]]|date=1994-05-22|work=[[The New York Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/02/05/AR2008020502879.html|title=New Europe, Old Russia|accessdate=2008-04-18|author=[[Robert Kagan]]|date=2008-02-06|work=[[The Washington Post]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=se01/&gt; but also for marketing purposes by various companies.{{cn|date=September 2014}} [[President of Russia|Russian President]] [[Vladimir Putin]] has declared the region Russia's "[[sphere of influence]]", and strategically vital for Russia.&lt;ref name=se01&gt;{{cite web|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A05E5D91039F936A15751C0A9679C8B63|title=The World; Learning to Fear Putin's Gaze|accessdate=2008-04-18|author=[[Steven Erlanger]]|date=2001-02-25|work=New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept has been compared to the [[Monroe Doctrine]].&lt;ref name=nyt/&gt;

===States and geographical groupings===

{{legend|#ffc600|[[Eastern Europe]]}}
{{legend|#f2553e|[[Russia]]}}
{{legend|#f18cbf|[[Transcaucasia]]}}]]

The 15 post-Soviet states are typically divided into the following five groupings. Each of these regions has its own common set of traits, owing not only to geographic and cultural factors but also to that region's history in relation to [[Russia]]. In addition, there are a number of de facto independent, but internationally unrecognized states (see the section [[#Separatist conflicts|Separatist conflicts]] below).

==Economy==

The [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]] took place as a result and against the backdrop of general economic stagnation, even regression. As the [[Gosplan]], which had set up production chains to cross [[Republics of the Soviet Union|SSR]] lines, broke down, the inter-republic economic connections were also disrupted, leading to even more serious breakdown of the post-Soviet economies.

Most of the formerly Soviet states began the [[transition economy|transition]] to a [[market economy]] from a [[command economy]] in 1990-1991 and made efforts to rebuild and restructure their economic systems, with varying results. In all, the process triggered severe economic declines, with [[Gross Domestic Product]] (GDP) dropping by more than 40% overall between 1990 and 1995.&lt;ref&gt;''Transition: The First Ten Years – Analysis and Lessons for Eastern Europe and the Former Soviet Union'', The World Bank, Washington, DC, 2002, p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; This decline in GDP was much more intense than the 27% decline that the United States suffered in the wake of the [[Great Depression]] between 1930 and 1934.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.k-a.kg/?nid=5&amp;value=6 GDP decline: transition and Great Depression compared], Kalikova and Associates Law Firm, Kyrgyzstan. Retrieved 13 January 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; The reconfiguration of public finance in compliance with [[capitalist]] principles resulted in dramatically reduced spending on health, education and other social programs, leading to a sharp increase in [[poverty]] and [[economic inequality]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C07E0D8163FF931A25753C1A9669C8B63 Study Finds Poverty Deepening in Former Communist Countries], New York Times, October 12, 2000&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last =  Scheidel| first = Walter | author-link =Walter Scheidel| title =The Great Leveler: Violence and the History of Inequality from the Stone Age to the Twenty-First Century | publisher = Princeton University Press| location =| year =2017  | isbn =978-0691165028|page= [https://books.google.com/books?id=NgZpDQAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA222#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false 222]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The economic shocks associated with wholesale [[privatization]] resulted in the excess deaths of roughly 1 million working age individuals throughout the former Soviet bloc in the 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ox.ac.uk/media/news_stories/2009/090115.html |title=Death surge linked with mass privatisation |publisher=[[University of Oxford]] |date=2009|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140702113600/http://www.ox.ac.uk/media/news_stories/2009/090115.html|archivedate=2014-07-02|accessdate=2015-06-28|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/7828901.stm Privatisation 'raised death rate']. ''[[BBC]],'' 15 January 2009. Retrieved 19 November 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; A study by economist [[Steven Rosefielde]] asserts that 3.4 million Russians died premature deaths from 1990 to 1998, partly as the result of "shock therapy" imposed by the [[Washington consensus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Rosefielde|first1=Steven|date=2001 |title=Premature Deaths: Russia's Radical Economic Transition in Soviet Perspective|url= |journal=[[Europe-Asia Studies]]|volume=53 |issue=8 |pages=1159-1176|doi= 10.1080/09668130120093174}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The initial transition decline was eventually arrested by the cumulative effect of market reforms, and after 1995 the economy in the post-Soviet states began to recover, with GDP switching from negative to positive growth rates. By 2007, 10 of the 15 post-Soviet states had recovered and reached GDP greater than what they had in 1991.&lt;ref name=imf&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20060509173048/http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/weo/2006/01/data/dbcselm.cfm?G=901 IMF online database]&lt;/ref&gt; Only Moldova, Ukraine, Georgia, Kyrgyzstan, and Tajikistan had GDP significantly below the 1991 level. The recovery in Russia was marginal, with GDP in 2006-2007 just nudging above the 1991 level. Combined with the aftershocks of the [[1998 Russian financial crisis|1998 economic crisis]] it led to a return of more interventionist economic policies by [[Vladimir Putin]]'s administration.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}} Some academic studies show that many former Soviet Republics and Warsaw Pact countries still have not caught up to their levels of output during the twilight of the Soviet era.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Ghodsee|first=Kristen|date=2017 |title=Red Hangover: Legacies of Twentieth-Century Communism|url=https://www.dukeupress.edu/red-hangover|location= |publisher=[[Duke University Press]]|pages=63 |isbn=978-0822369493|author-link=Kristen R.

[[File:Commonwealth of Independent States vs EU and NATO.svg|upright=0.9|thumb|{{legend|#FFFFD0|CIS members}}{{legend|#3CE67B|States that joined [[European Union|EU]],
 [[NATO]]}} and [[OECD]]{{legend|#FFD0D0|Other EU or NATO members}}]]

A number of [[regional organization]]s and cooperating blocs have sprung up since the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]]. Only organizations that are mainly (or completely) composed of post-Soviet states are listed in this section; organizations with wider memberships are not discussed. The 15 post-Soviet states are divided in their participation to the regional blocs:
* [[Belarus]], [[Russia]], and [[Ukraine]] founded the [[Commonwealth of Independent States]] (CIS) in December 1991. It was conceived as a successor organization to the [[USSR]], and in December 1993 it included 12 of the 15 former [[Soviet republics]] (except the three Baltic states).&lt;ref name=ratification/&gt; It currently consists of nine of the 15 former Soviet republics, with one participating state (Ukraine) and one associate state ([[Turkmenistan]]). Georgia withdrew from the CIS in August 2008.
* The three Baltic states have not sought membership in any of these post-Soviet organizations, seeking and achieving membership in the [[European Union]] and [[NATO]] instead, although their electricity and rail systems remain closely connected with former Soviet organizations. The sole exception to the above has been their recent membership in the [[Community of Democratic Choice]].
* The Central Asian states of [[Kazakhstan]], [[Kyrgyzstan]], [[Tajikistan]], and [[Uzbekistan]] (as well as Belarus) are members of the CIS and participate in several regional organizations that have Russia as a primary mover. Such organizations are the [[Eurasian Economic Community]] (later merged with [[Eurasian Economic Union]], which Tajikistan and Uzbekistan are not members of), [[Collective Security Treaty Organization]],  and the [[Shanghai Cooperation Organization]]. The last two groups only became distinct once Uzbekistan withdrew from [[GUAM]] and sought membership in EurAsEc and CSTO (which it subsequently withdrew from in 2008 and 2012, respectively).
* [[Armenia]], besides its membership in CIS participates in [[Collective Security Treaty Organization]] and the [[Eurasian Economic Union]].
* Ukraine, [[Moldova]], and [[Azerbaijan]] participate in the CIS but other than that they mostly cooperate within regional organizations that are not dominated by Russia. Such organizations are GUAM and the Community of Democratic Choice.

=== Commonwealth of Independent States ===
{{main|Commonwealth of Independent States}}
The Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) consists of 10 former [[Soviet Republics]] that differ in their membership status. As of December 2010, 9 countries have ratified the CIS charter and are full CIS members (Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Moldova, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Russia, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan), one country (Turkmenistan) is an associate member and two countries (Georgia, Ukraine) left the organization in 2009 and in 2018. In 2014, Ukraine declined its CIS chairmanship and considered withdrawal from the organization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2014/03/19/us-ukraine-crisis-cis-idUSBREA2I17F20140319 |title=Ukraine Says It Could Quit Russia-Led Bloc |author=Reuters |date=March 19, 2014 |publisher=Reuters |accessdate=Jan 14, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{main|Eurasian Economic Community}}
The Eurasian Economic Community (EURASEC), formerly the CIS Customs Union, was established by [[Russia]], [[Belarus]], [[Kazakhstan]], [[Kyrgyzstan]] and [[Tajikistan]]. [[Ukraine]] and [[Moldova]] have observer status in the community; however, Ukraine has declared its desire not to become a full member state. Because having common borders with the rest of the community is a prerequisite for full membership, Moldova is barred from seeking it. [[Uzbekistan]] applied for membership in October 2005,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.rian.ru/russia/20051110/42053167.html |title=Working group discusses Uzbekistan's accession to EurAsEC |author=Sputnik |date=10 November 2005 |work=rian.ru |accessdate=2 December 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130501224247/http://en.rian.ru/russia/20051110/42053167.html |archivedate=May 1, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; when the process of merging [[Central Asian Cooperation Organization]] and the Eurasian Economic Community began; it joined on 25 January 2006.

Seven CIS member states, namely [[Russia]], [[Belarus]], [[Kazakhstan]], [[Kyrgyzstan]], [[Tajikistan]], [[Uzbekistan]] and [[Armenia]], have enhanced their military cooperation, establishing the Collective Security Treaty Organization (CSTO), this being an expansion of the previous Collective Security Treaty (CST). [[Uzbekistan]] which (alongside Georgia and Azerbaijan) withdrew from the CST in 1999, joined GUAM. Then in 2005 it withdrew from GUAM and joined the CSTO in 2006.

Ukraine also declared joining NATO as its geopolitical goal once again in 2017 (first time being right after the [[Orange revolution]] and in the beginning of presidency of [[Viktor Yushchenko]]), after the presidency of [[Viktor Yanukovych]], during which the government officially declared neutrality and ceased to seek NATO membership.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pravda.com.ua/news/2017/06/8/7146297/|title=Рада зробила пріоритетом для України вступ до НАТО|last=Kizilov|first=Yevhen|date=8 June 2017|publisher=[[Ukrayinska Pravda]]|access-date=14 February 2018|language=Ukrainian|trans-title=Verkhovna Rada made joining NATO a priority for Ukraine}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.unian.info/politics/2333875-poroshenko-eu-nato-membership-remains-ukraines-strategic-goal-not-prospect-of-2018.html|title=Poroshenko: EU, NATO membership remains Ukraine's strategic goal, not prospect of 2018|date=6 January 2018|publisher=[[UNIAN]]|access-date=14 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other states in the [[Partnership for Peace]] and [[Individual Partnership Action Plan]] program include Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Moldova, Russia, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan.

=== GUAM ===
{{main|GUAM Organization for Democracy and Economic Development}}
Four member states, namely [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], [[Ukraine]], [[Azerbaijan]] and [[Moldova]] established the GUAM group that was largely seen as intending to counter Russian dominance in the region. Notably, these four nations do not participate in any of the other
regional organizations that sprang up in the region since the dissolution of the Soviet Union (other
than the CIS).

{{main|Union of Russia and Belarus}}
The Union of Russia and Belarus was originally formed on 2 April 1996 under the name ''Commonwealth of Russia and Belarus'', before being tightened further on 8 December 1999. It was initiated by the president of Belarus, [[Alexander Lukashenko]]. On paper, the Union of Russia and Belarus intends further integration, beyond the scope of mere cooperation, including the introduction of the [[Russian ruble|ruble]] as a common currency.

]]

The Economic Cooperation Organization was originally formed in 1985 by [[Turkey]], [[Iran]] and [[Pakistan]] but in 1992 the organization was expanded to include [[Afghanistan]] and the six primarily Muslim former Soviet republics: [[Azerbaijan]], [[Kazakhstan]], [[Kyrgyzstan]], [[Tajikistan]], [[Turkmenistan]] and [[Uzbekistan]].

===Community for Democracy and Rights of Nations===
{{main|Community for Democracy and Rights of Nations}}
The post-Soviet [[disputed states]] of [[Abkhazia]], [[Republic of Artsakh|Artsakh]], [[South Ossetia]], and [[Transnistria]] are all members of the [[Community for Democracy and Rights of Nations]] which aims to forge closer integration.

=== Community of Democratic Choice ===
{{main|Community of Democratic Choice}}
The Community of Democratic Choice (CDC) was formed in December 2005 at the primary instigation of Ukraine and Georgia, and composed of six post-Soviet states (Ukraine, Georgia, Moldova, and the three [[Baltic states]] of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania) and three other countries of Eastern and Central Europe ([[Slovenia]], [[Romania]] and the [[Republic of Macedonia]]). The [[Black Sea Forum]] (BSF) is a closely related organization. Observer countries include [[Armenia]], [[Bulgaria]], and [[Poland]].

Just like GUAM before it, this forum is largely seen as intending to counteract Russian influence in the area. This is the only international forum centered in the post-Soviet space in which the Baltic states also participate. In addition, the other three post-Soviet states in it are all members of GUAM.

=== Shanghai Cooperation Organisation ===

{{legend|Green|Member state}}

{{legend|#00a0aa|Applicants for observer status}}
]]
The Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO), is composed of China and five post-Soviet states, namely Russia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan. The organization was founded in 2001, though its predecessor, the Shanghai Five grouping, has existed since 1996. Its aims revolve around security-related issues such as border
demarcation, terrorism and energy.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.europarl.europa.eu/RegData/etudes/ATAG/2015/545718/EPRS_ATA(2015)545718_REV1_EN.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

===Economic cooperation organizations===
* [[Central European Free Trade Agreement]] (CEFTA) with Moldova (it includes also non post-Soviet countries of the former Yugoslavia; previously, also included other Central European countries that left CEFTA when joining the European Union; CEFTA plays a role in Central Europe similar to what [[European Free Trade Association]] (EFTA) provides in Western Europe for non EU-members; this alliance an economical organization with strong cooperation with the European Union, for countries that do not want to participate in EurAsEC centered on Russia but that are seeking alliances to the West); even if [[Moldova]] is the only CEFTA country that is still within a weakening CIS, it no longer participates to the CSTO for most of the common security policy (but cannot join the EU because of incompatibility with WEU stability rules and the unsolved problem of [[Transnistria]]) but can still benefit from the Free Trade Area notably with Romania and Bulgaria (in the EU).
* [[Black Sea Economic Cooperation]] (BSEC) with Russia, Georgia, Ukraine, Azerbaijan, Moldova, Turkey, Albania, Greece, Romania, Bulgaria, Serbia and Armenia (an economic organisation closely related to the SCO but more focused regionally to include also Armenia; it also aims for the harmonious development of democracy for increasing the commerce in South-East Europe and includes some EU members, so it cannot be a regional free-trade union).
* The [[European Union]] (EU) with the three Baltic countries that were the first ones to declare independence from the former USSR and have never joined CIS after the collapse of USSR (it includes also now some post-communist countries in [[Central Europe]], that have left CEFTA when entering the EU : Poland, Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary, Romania, Bulgaria and Slovenia).

=== Political integration and security alliances ===
* [[Stability Pact for South Eastern Europe]] (SPforSEE) with Moldova (similar in structure to CEFTA, but does not focus on economy but security, for those countries that are not NATO members); this organization largely cooperates with NATO, and is related to the group of observers at [[Western European Union]] (WEU).
* The [[North Atlantic Treaty Organization]] (NATO), for Baltic countries, Poland, and Central European countries that have also joined the EU (the EU membership includes also WEU membership because they follow the [[Common Foreign and Security Policy]] and [[European Security and Defence Policy]] policies shared now by the EU, the WEU and all European NATO members).
* The other remaining countries are those part of the former Yugoslavia, but their recent conflict and political tensions still does not allow them to cooperate efficiently for their political integration and for their mutual security; in addition, they still do not have full sovereignty in this domain (some of them are still under surveillance by EU or NATO, as mandated by UNO). They still need to find an internal stability and they can collaborate economically with the help of other organizations focusing on economy or political cooperation and development. However a more limited cooperation for security is possible through their membership to the larger [[Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe]] (OSCE).
* The only exception is Belarus (whose post-soviet democratic transition did not occur) that still rejects political integration, and all security alliances with NATO, OSCE, WEU or other countries in Europe other than Russia (which the process of reintegration of Belarus has been tightened in almost all domains).

====Organizations in other domains====
* [[Southeast European Cooperation Process]] (SEECP) with Moldova (similar to SPforSEE, but focuses on political integration than cooperation for security, and to CEFTA but does not focus on trade).
* [[Southeast European Cooperative Initiative]] (SECI) with Moldova (closely related to SEECP).
* [[Central European Initiative]] (CEI) with Moldova, Ukraine and Belarus (and also Central and South-Western European countries in the European Union; it aims at helping Eastern European countries to reach the EU standards and cooperate politically and find a better economic development and a strong, working but more democratic legal system); it is the only regional organization where Belarus is still a member (but the political cooperation with Belarus is almost stalled, as it is the only country of the former Communist block country that balances in favor of stronger cooperation with Russia and against integration with EU and NATO ; however Belarus remains isolated and still does not cooperate too in the SCO group led by Russia and China).
* [[Black Sea Forum for Partnership and Dialogue]] (BSF) with Georgia, Ukraine, Azerbaijan, Moldova and Armenia (also non post-soviet countries that are NATO members, interested in their maintaining political stability and avoiding conflicts in the region: Romania, Bulgaria and Turkey, whose first two are also now EU and CEI members, using EU rules for their political   development); however this organization does not focus on helping countries to join the EU, but reaching common standards and good governance and internal stability and democracy like in the CEI.
* None of these organizations are incompatible with the policy required for accessing EU membership in the domain of political cooperation and development.{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}
* Merging the CEI and BSF is desired by Central European countries, that are members of both (often in addition to EU with stronger objectives) that would like to simplify the development process, and also members of the [[Council of Europe]] that federates (but at very slow pace) all European efforts of political cooperation and development through the various regional organizations.{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}
* [[Community for Democracy and Rights of Nations]]

===Other organizations===
Apart from above, the former Soviet republics also hold membership in a number of multinational organizations such as:
* [[Baltic Basketball League]]
* [[FIBA]]
* [[FIFA]]
* [[International Ice Hockey Federation]]
* [[International Olympic Committee]]
* [[International Paralympic Committee]]
* [[Kontinental Hockey League]] (Belarus, Kazakhstan, Latvia, Russia)
* [[Miss Universe]]
* [[UNESCO]]
* [[World Health Organization]]
* [[World Trade Organization]]

==Politics==
Regarding [[political freedom]] in the former Soviet republics, [[Freedom House]]'s 2015 report listed the following:
* [[Estonia]], [[Latvia]], and [[Lithuania]] as "free" countries.
* [[Armenia]], [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], [[Kyrgyzstan]], [[Moldova]], and [[Ukraine]] were listed as "partly free."
* [[Azerbaijan]], [[Belarus]], [[Kazakhstan]], [[Russia]], [[Tajikistan]], [[Turkmenistan]], and [[Uzbekistan]] were listed as "not free", with Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan being noted as among the "worst of the worst".

Similarly, the Worldwide Press Freedom Index published by [[Reporters Without Borders]] in 2015, recorded the following as regards [[press freedom]]:
* A good situation in [[Estonia]]
* A satisfactory situation in [[Latvia]] and [[Lithuania]]
* Noticeable problems in [[Armenia]], [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], [[Kyrgyzstan]], and [[Moldova]]
* A difficult situation in  [[Belarus]], [[Kazakhstan]], [[Russia]], [[Tajikistan]], and [[Ukraine]]
* A very serious situation in [[Azerbaijan]], [[Turkmenistan]], and [[Uzbekistan]]

It has been remarked that several post-Soviet states have not changed leadership since their independence, such as [[Nursultan Nazarbayev]] in Kazakhstan and [[Islam Karimov]] in Uzbekistan, until his death in September 2016. All of these had originally more limited terms but through decrees or referendums prolonged their stay in office (a practice also followed by Presidents [[Alexander Lukashenko]] of Belarus and [[Emomalii Rahmon]] of Tajikistan) [[Askar Akayev]] of [[Kyrgyzstan]] had likewise served as [[President of Kyrgyzstan|President]] since its independence until he was forced to resign as a result of the [[Kyrgyz revolution of 2005]]. [[Saparmurat Niyazov]] in Turkmenistan ruled from independence until his death in 2006, creating a [[personality cult]] around himself.

The issue of dynastical succession has been another element affecting the politics of some post-Soviet States. [[Heydar Aliyev]], after constructing an [[Heydar Aliyev's cult of personality|extensive and ongoing cult of personality]], handed the Presidency of Azerbaijan to his son, [[Ilham Aliyev]]. Theories about the children of other leaders in Central Asia being groomed for succession abound.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://forumkz.addr.com/2004en/en_forum_09_08_04.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2005-04-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050312151938/http://forumkz.addr.com/2004en/en_forum_09_08_04.htm |archivedate=2005-03-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The participation of Akayev's son and daughter in the [[Kyrgyz parliamentary elections, 2005|2005 Kyrgyz parliamentary elections]] boosted fears of dynastic succession being used in Kyrgyzstan as well, and may have contributed to the anti-Akayev climate that led to his overthrow.

===Separatist conflicts===
{{Post-Soviet Conflicts}}
{{See also|Post-Soviet conflicts}}

Economic, political, national, military, and social problems have all been factors in [[separatism]] in the Post-Soviet space. In many cases, problems due to factors such as ethnic divisions existed before the fall of the Soviet Union, and upon the fall of the union were brought into the open.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.colorado.edu/ibs/pec/johno/pub/PsgeTMR.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Such territories and resulting military conflicts have so far been:

====Current declared states====
* {{flag|Abkhazia}}, which is ''de facto'' independent from Georgia. Tensions in the area broke out when Georgia sent in troops in 1992 to control groups who wanted separation. The troops and most of the Georgian and Mingrelian speaking population were forced out in 1993, and the region declared independence in 1999. The [[Russia–Georgia war|2008 war]] between Georgian forces and the separatist and Russian forces led to Russia's recognition of Abkhazia's independence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/3261059.stm | work=BBC News | title=Regions and territories: Abkhazia | date=12 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* {{flag|Republic of Artsakh}}, which is ''de facto'' independent from Azerbaijan. Ethnic conflict between Armenians and Azerbaijanis began in 1988, and expanded into [[Nagorno-Karabakh War|war]] which lasted till a ceasefire in 1994. Sporadic attempts at negotiating a final peace and sporadic bursts of violence have continued since then.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/country_profiles/3658938.stm | work=BBC News | title=Regions and territories: Nagorno-Karabakh | date=10 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* {{flag|Donetsk People's Republic}} and {{flag|Lugansk People's Republic}},  unrecognized states which declared independence from [[Ukraine]] in 2014.
* {{flag|South Ossetia}}, which is ''de facto'' independent from Georgia. The region declared its intent to seek independence in 1990, leading to a conflict which led to a ceasefire in 1992. Separatism became powerful after the election of Georgian President [[Mikhail Saakashvili]] in 2004, and a referendum in 2006 was in favour of declaring independence. The [[Russia–Georgia war|2008 war]] between Georgian forces and the separatist and Russian forces led to Russia's recognition of South Ossetia's independence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/country_profiles/3797729.stm | work=BBC News | title=Regions and territories: South Ossetia | date=25 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* {{flag|Transnistria|state}}, which is ''de facto'' independent from Moldova. It declared independence in 1990, due to its majority Russian-speaking population fearing union with [[Romania]]. A ceasefire between Transnistrian forces and Moldovan forces has been in place since 1992, enforced by the presence of Russian forces in Transnistria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/country_profiles/3641826.stm | work=BBC News | title=Trans-Dniester profile | date=26 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Former declared states====
* {{flag|Chechen Republic of Ichkeria}}, where [[Dzhokhar Dudayev]] declared independence from Russia in 1991, leading to a violent war between local separatist forces and the Russian army. Russia first [[First Chechen War|invaded in 1994]], withdrawing after a deal for increased autonomy was granted in 1996. Tensions have continued in the years since then, and the conflict has spilled over into neighbouring regions such as [[Dagestan]], [[Ingushetia]] and [[North Ossetia–Alania]]. Russia claims that the situation in Chechnya has normalised.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/country_profiles/2565049.stm | work=BBC News | title=Regions and territories: Chechnya | date=22 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* {{flag|Gagauzia}}, declared itself the "Gagauz Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic" within Moldova on 12 November 1989, and the "Gagauz Soviet Socialist Republic", independent of Moldova but still within the [[Soviet Union]], on 19 August 1990, but was reintegrated into Moldova as an autonomous region on 23 December 1994.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00905999808408552|title=Territorial autonomy in Gagauzia|first1=Jeff|last1=Chinn|first2=Steven|last2=Roper|journal=[[Nationalities Papers]]|volume=26|number=1|year=1998|quote=But on 19 August 1990, the Gagauz elite, led by President Stepan Topal and Supreme Soviet Chairperson Mihail Kendighelean, quickly took the next step, declaring Gagauzia to be independent of Moldova and subject only to central Soviet authority|doi=10.1080/00905999808408552|pages=87–101}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://leader.viitorul.org/public/513/en/Conflicttransform%20Neukirch.pdf|title=Autonomy And Conflict Transformation: The Case Of The Gagauz Territorial Autonomy In The Republic Of Moldova|first=Claus|last=Neukirch|publisher=[[European Centre for Minority Issues]]|quote=On 12 November 1989, a "Gagauz Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic" was proclaimed by an assembly in Comrat ...

The next day, the Republic of Crimea declared independence, and within days Russia absorbed the peninsula. Ukraine continues to claim Crimea as an integral part of its territory.

===Civil wars===
{{see also|Post-Soviet conflicts}}
Civil wars unrelated to separatist movements have occurred twice in the region:
* The [[Georgian Civil War]] between the forces of [[Zviad Gamsakhurdia]] and [[Eduard Shevardnadze]]. The war ended after Russian forces intervened in support of Shevardnadze's government, which in turn agreed to join the [[Commonwealth of Independent States]].
* The [[Tajikistani Civil War]] that lasted between 1992 and 1997.

===Colour revolutions===
Since 2003, a number of (largely) peaceful "[[colour revolution]]s" have happened in some post-Soviet states after disputed elections, with popular protests bringing into power the former opposition.
* The [[Rose Revolution]] in Georgia, leading to the fall from office of [[Eduard Shevardnadze]].
* The [[Orange Revolution]] in Ukraine, bringing into power [[Viktor Yushchenko]].
* The [[Tulip Revolution]] in Kyrgyzstan, leading to the resignation of [[Askar Akayev]].
* The [[2018 Armenian Velvet Revolution]] in Armenia, leading to the resignation of [[Serzh Sargsyan]].

===Russian population in post-Soviet states===
{{main|Russians in Ukraine|Russians in Kazakhstan|Russians in Latvia|Russians in Estonia|Russians in Lithuania|Russians in Georgia}}
There is a significant [[Russophone]] population in most of the post-Soviet states, whose political position as an [[ethnic minority]] varies from country to country.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Greenall, [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/4420922.stm Russians left behind in Central Asia], [[BBC News]], 23 November 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; While Belarus, Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan, in addition to Russia, have kept [[Russian language|Russian]] as an official language, the language lost its status in other post-Soviet states after the end of the Soviet Union. It maintains semi-official status in all CIS member states, because it is the organisation's official working language, but in the three Baltic States, the Russian language is not recognized in any official capacity. Georgia, since its departure from the CIS in 2009, has begun operating its government almost exclusively in the Georgian language.

===Religion===
While the Soviet system placed severe restrictions on religious intellectual life, traditions continued to survive. After the dissolution of the Soviet Union, Islamic movements have emerged alongside ethnic and secular ones. Vitaly Naumkin gives the following assessment: "Throughout the time of change, Islam has served as a symbol of identity, a force for mobilization, and a pressure for democracy. This is one of the few social disasters that the church has survived, in which it was not the cause.  But if successful politically, it faces economic challenges beyond its grasp."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

The [[Central Asia]]n states ([[Kazakhstan]], [[Kyrgyzstan]], [[Tajikistan]], [[Turkmenistan]], and [[Uzbekistan]]) plus [[Azerbaijan]] from [[Transcaucasia|Southern caucasus]] are [[Muslim]], except for their dwindling [[Russians|Russian]] and other European minorities. The [[Baltic States]] are historically [[Western Christian]] ([[Protestant]] and [[Roman Catholic]]), which adds another layer of pro-Western orientation to those countries, although the vast majority of what was the Protestant population (Estonia and northern Latvia) there is now irreligious. The dominant religion in the remaining former Soviet countries ([[Armenia]], [[Belarus]], [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], [[Moldova]], [[Russia]], and [[Ukraine]]) is [[Orthodox Christianity]]. In most countries, religiosity has increased since the Soviet collapse.

=== Environment ===
The Soviet Union promoted environmental sentiments and had a constitutional clause on environmental protection.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Thomas|first=Valerie M.|last2=Orlova|first2=Anna O.|date=2001|title=Soviet and Post-Soviet Environmental Management: Lessons from a Case Study on Lead Pollution|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/4315114|journal=Ambio|volume=30|issue=2|pages=104–111}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some environmental strides were made, such as the banning of lead-based paint and gasoline in the 20th century.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; However, there was environmental degradation in the former Soviet Union, which is attributed to rapid industrialization and a lack of institutions that were able to curb pollution levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wernstedt|first=Kris|date=July 2002|title=Environmental Protection in the Russian Federation: Lessons and Opportunities|url=https://doi.org/10.1080/09640560220143521|journal=Journal of Environmental Planning and Management|language=en|volume=45|issue=4|pages=493–516|doi=10.1080/09640560220143521|issn=0964-0568}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

===== Russia =====
Russia has an expansive amount of land which contains a high amount of natural resources and biodiversity. Protected natural areas, or ''zapovedniki,'' were created under the Soviet Union.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Soviet leaders attributed former pollution and environmental degradation in Russia to private enterprise and capitalism.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Henry|first=Laura A.|last2=Douhovnikoff|first2=Vladimir|date=2008-11|title=Environmental Issues in Russia|url=https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/abs/10.1146/annurev.environ.33.051007.082437|journal=Annual Review of Environment and Resources|language=en|volume=33|issue=1|pages=437–460|doi=10.1146/annurev.environ.33.051007.082437|issn=1543-5938}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, environmental problems arose in Russia under the Soviets because industrialization was favored over over environmentalism, and there was little discussion on how to properly use resources and they were depreciated.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The task of environmental governance was distributed among 15 different ministries.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; There is controversy among academics as to whether environmental destruction under the Soviet Union can be attributed to Marxist ideology or to the industrialization push.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In 1988, there was the formation of the State Committee on Environmental Protection, or the ''Goskompriroda''.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The 1990s saw experiments in taxing pollution of various forms, though this was largely ineffective due to the low charge levels and inflation, as well as more areas of protected land, but there was difficulty overseeing these areas due to small budgets.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In 1991 under the independent Russian Federation, the Federal Act on the Protection of the Natural Environment was passed and the State Committee on Environmental Protection became the Ministry of the Environment and developed sustainable development goals.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In 1996, Yeltsin demoted the Ministry of the Environment to the State Committee on Environmental Protection, and in 2000 Putin ends the State Committee on Environmental Protection and the Federal Forestry Service and tasks the Ministry of Natural Resources with their responsibilities.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In 2001, to the ire of many environmental advocates, Russia passed a law which allowed the acceptance, treatment, and storage the nuclear fuel of other nations for profit.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The Environmental Doctrine was passed in 2002, the Water Code was passed in 2006, and the Forest Code was passed in 2007, though these policies have been critiqued for the difficulty in enforcing them.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Today, Russia has a low population density with most citizens gathered in the cities, so environmental degradation is concentrated in certain areas.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Putin is criticized by environmental advocates for prioritizing economic gain over environmental protection, and there are high levels of greenhouse gas emissions and frequent oil spills.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Ever since the dissolution of the Soviet Union a certain number of people have expressed a longing for the Soviet period and its values. The level of post-Soviet nostalgia varies across the former republics. For example, certain groups of people may blend the Soviet and post-Soviet experience in their daily lives.{{clarify|date=August 2012}}.&lt;ref&gt;See: Kaprans, M. (2009) [http://www.satori.lv/raksts/3114 Then and now: Comparing the Soviet and Post-Soviet experience in Latvian autobiographies]''Keywords'' 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to July 2012 polling in Ukraine by [[Sociological group "RATING"|RATING]], 42% of respondents supported the formation of a unified state of Ukraine, Russia and Belarus; earlier in 2012 this support had been 48%.&lt;ref name=RatingJuly12&gt;[http://ratinggroup.com.ua/en/products/politic/data/entry/14004/ The language question, the results of recent research in 2012], [[Sociological group "RATING"|RATING]] (25 May 2012)&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2016 poll of Russian citizens conducted by [[Levada Center]] showed that the majority viewed the collapse of the USSR negatively and felt that it could have been avoided, and an even greater number would openly welcome a revival of the Soviet system.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.rt.com/politics/340158-most-russians-regret-ussr-has/ Most Russians regret USSR collapse, dream of its return, poll shows].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8475">'''Reactive destocking''' in [[supply chain]] management is a reduction of the [[inventory]] when expected [[demand]] goes down. When a company is only doing reactive destocking, the desired inventory to sales ratio,&lt;ref name="inventory to sales ratio"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.toolkit.com/small_business_guide/sbg.aspx?nid=P06_4260|title=Small Business Guide}}&lt;/ref&gt; remains unchanged. Reactive destocking in general is done by operational managers of the logistical activities, without additional instructions. The inventory can include finished products, [[raw materials]] and/or goods in process.

The term "reactive destocking" is relevant when it is used in connection with [[active destocking]]. Active destocking refers to an active decision to reduce the inventory to sales ratio&lt;ref name="inventory to sales ratio"/&gt; of a company.  In general, active destocking is done following an autonomous, often financial decision by a company to improve its efficiency, freeing up cash and reducing its costs. Decisions for active destocking in general are made by financial executives or general managers.

The terms "reactive de-stocking" and "active de-stocking" were first used in an article about the [[Lehman wave]], published by Dutch researchers in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Steen |first=Michael |url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/8a93185c-ee99-11de-944c-00144feab49a.html |title='Lehman wave' set to help track recovery |publisher=FT.com |date=2009-12-22 |accessdate=2012-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="lehman wave"&gt;{{cite web|title=Responding to the Lehman Wave: Sales Forecasting and Supply Management during the Credit Crisis &amp;#124; Beta |url=http://beta.ieis.tue.nl/node/1502 |author1=Robert Peels |author2=Maximiliano Udenio |author3=Jan C. Fransoo |author4=Marcel Wolfs |author5=Tom Hendrikx |publisher=Technical University Eindhoven}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A Lehman wave refers to an economy-wide fluctuation in production and in economic activity with a wavelength of between 12 and 18 months, driven by a sudden major disruption of the economic system. The Lehman Wave is a dampened, wave-like fluctuation around equilibrium. The amplitude of the Lehman wave is larger for a business that is further away from its end market than for a business that is closer to its end market, which difference is caused by cumulative destocking of the intermediate supply chain.

The first described Lehman wave was caused by global active destocking, followed by reactive destocking after the financial panic following the [[bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers]] on September 15, 2008. The Lehman Wave can have strong effects on the sales volume and therefore on the profitability of companies higher in the value chain.&lt;ref name="strong effects"&gt;{{cite web|title=Lehman Wave shakes the Coating Industry|url=http://www.european-coatings.com|author1=Robert Peels |author2=Maximiliano Udenio |author3=Jan C. Fransoo |author4=Marcel Wolfs |author5=Tomg Hendrikx |author6=Dimitri de Vreeze |publisher=European Coatings Journal|date= April 2004|pages=10–12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Effect on the Lehman wave==
Active destocking caused the Lehman wave and reactive destocking deepened it. The strong dip in the manufacturing industry seen at the end of 2008 was caused by cumulative and synchronized active destocking followed by reactive destocking, triggered by the bankruptcy of [[Lehman Brothers]]. Said bankruptcy created a sudden peak in the [[Libor]] interest rate, causing the banks to recall credit and companies to start freeing up cash by active destocking, so reducing their [[stocks]]. When the customers of a company start active destocking it is experienced by said company as lower demand and said company will respond by doing reactive destocking. End markets also responded by going down, but slower and in most markets not so strongly. The drop in end market plus the active and reactive destocking created a giant [[damped wave]], the so-called Lehman wave. 
 [[File:Lehman Wave curve and economic cycle curve.jpg|right|thumb|400px|''Fig 1: Red curve is the Lehman Wave as a fluctuation around the equilibrium, in this simplified example the black line represents the longer term economic cycle.'']]

==Relation between inventory to sales ratio and inventory following active destocking==
When a company takes an active destocking decision, said company expresses the wish to reduce the inventory to sales ratio. In a real world, the actual inventory can first go up, before going down, depending on the behavior of the other players in the supply chain.

==Active and reactive destocking ==
Active and reactive destocking explains why some companies can see a strong dip in sales while their end markets are fairly stable. If the supply chain between a company and its end-customer would have a [[stock depth]] of "250 days' sales", meaning that it takes at least 250 days for a molecule to travel from a companies' warehouse to the end consumer, and if each firm in such a 250-day supply chain decides to do active destocking of 12%, an amount of stock equal to 30 days’ sales (a whole month) is taken out of the chain. For a company at the beginning of the supply chain this will result in either a business standstill for a whole month or a 33% decline during three months.
This discovery of active destocking, reactive destocking and the Lehman Wave can have important implications for manufacturing scheduling, inventory management, work force management and budgeting.&lt;ref name="implications"&gt;{{cite web|title=About.com Financial Careers|url= http://financecareers.about.com/od/jp/g/Lehman_Wave.htm|author=Mark Kolakowski}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relation with active destocking, the Lehman wave and bullwhip effect==
While the existence of the [[bullwhip effect]] has been extensively documented (e.g., Forrester (1961),&lt;ref&gt;Forrester, J.W. (1961), Industrial Dynamics. Cambridge: MIT Press, and New York: John Wiley &amp; Sons.&lt;/ref&gt; Sterman (1989),&lt;ref name="Sterman, J.D. 1989"&gt;Sterman, J.D. (1989), Modeling Managerial Behavior: Misperceptions of Feedback in a Dynamic Decision Making Experiment, Management Science 35:3, 321-339.&lt;/ref&gt; and Lee et al. (1997),&lt;ref&gt;Lee, H.L., V. Padmanabhan, and S. Whang (1997), Information Distortion in a Supply Chain: The Bullwhip Effect, Management Science, 43:4, 546-558.&lt;/ref&gt; Croson and Donohue (2006)&lt;ref&gt;Croson, R., and K. Donohue (2006), Behavioral causes of the bullwhip effect and the observed value of inventory information, Management Science, 52:3, 323-336.&lt;/ref&gt;), there have been arguments about its existence in the overall economy or in supply chains encompassing numerous companies. Cachon et al. (2007)&lt;ref&gt;Cachon, G.P., T. Randall, and G.M. Schmidt (2007), In Search of the Bullwhip Effect, Manufacturing &amp; Service Operations Management 9:4, 457-479.&lt;/ref&gt; recently argued that no evidence of the existence of the bullwhip effect could be found. Fransoo and Wouters (2000)&lt;ref&gt;Fransoo, J.C., and M.J.F. Wouters (2000), Measuring the bullwhip effect in the supply chain, Supply Chain Management: An International Journal 5:2, 78-89&lt;/ref&gt; and Chen and Lee (2009)&lt;ref&gt;Chen, L., and H.L. Lee (2009), Information Sharing and Order Variability Control Under a Generalized Demand Model, Management Science 55:5, 781-797.&lt;/ref&gt; argue that in order to observe the bullwhip effect it is crucial to measure it correctly. Both these papers argue that improper aggregation essentially takes away the opportunity to observe the bullwhip effect. In the [[beer distribution game]] (Sterman, 1989&lt;ref name="Sterman, J.D. 1989"/&gt;), the bullwhip effect is created by a single pulse. In Sterman's experiment, this single pulse is an increase in the demand level. In the case of the Lehman wave that started in September 2008 the single pulse is active destocking, in this case a synchronized decrease in the target inventory-over-sales level along the entire supply chain. A reduction of inventories under stable or slightly decreasing sales can only be achieved if purchases are reduced or postponed. As a consequence of the decision to reduce inventory, therefore, many companies substantially reduced their purchases of supplies or raw materials. Obviously, companies further upstream in the supply chain were hit more than companies downstream. Therefore, the Lehman wave can be described as a synchronized bullwhip caused by active destocking, followed by reactive destocking.

'''Reality''' is the sum or aggregate of all that is real or [[Existence|existent]], as opposed to that which is merely [[Object of the mind|imaginary]]. The term is also used to refer to the ontological status of things, indicating their existence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/reality|title=reality {{!}} Definition of reality in English by Oxford Dictionaries|website=Oxford Dictionaries {{!}} English|access-date=2017-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[physics|physical]] terms, reality is the totality of the [[universe]], known and unknown. Philosophical questions about the nature of reality or existence or being are considered under the rubric of [[ontology]], which is a major branch of [[metaphysics]] in the Western philosophical tradition. Ontological questions also feature in diverse branches of philosophy, including the [[philosophy of science]], [[philosophy of religion]], [[philosophy of mathematics]], and [[philosophical logic]]. These include questions about whether only physical objects are real (i.e., [[Physicalism]]), whether reality is fundamentally immaterial (e.g., [[Idealism]]), whether hypothetical unobservable entities posited by scientific theories exist, whether [[God]] exists, whether numbers and other [[abstract objects]] exist, and whether [[Possible world|possible worlds]] exist.

=== World views and theories ===

{{Further|World view}}

A common colloquial usage would have ''reality'' mean "perceptions, beliefs, and attitudes toward reality", as in "My reality is not your reality." This is often used just as a [[colloquialism]] indicating that the parties to a conversation agree, or should agree, not to quibble over deeply different conceptions of what is real. For example, in a religious discussion between friends, one might say (attempting humor), "You might disagree, but in my reality, everyone goes to heaven."

Reality can be defined in a way that links it to worldviews or parts of them (conceptual frameworks): Reality is the totality of all things, structures (actual and conceptual), events (past and present) and phenomena, whether observable or not. It is what a world view (whether it be based on individual or shared human experience) ultimately attempts to describe or map.

Certain ideas from physics, philosophy, sociology, [[literary criticism]], and other fields shape various theories of reality. One such belief is that there simply and literally ''is'' no reality beyond the perceptions or beliefs we each have about reality. Such attitudes are summarized in the popular statement, "Perception is reality" or "Life is how you perceive reality" or "reality is what you can get away with" ([[Robert Anton Wilson]]), and they indicate [[anti-realism]]&amp;nbsp;– that is, the view that there is no objective reality, whether acknowledged explicitly or not.

Many of the concepts of science and philosophy are often defined [[culture|culturally]] and [[sociology|socially]]. This idea was elaborated by [[Thomas Kuhn]] in his book ''[[The Structure of Scientific Revolutions]]'' (1962). ''[[The Social Construction of Reality]]'', a book about the [[sociology of knowledge]] written by [[Peter L. Berger]] and [[Thomas Luckmann]], was published in 1966. It explained how knowledge is acquired and used for the comprehension of reality. Out of all the realities, the reality of everyday life is the most important one since our consciousness requires us to be completely aware and attentive to the experience of everyday life.

== Western philosophy ==
[[Philosophy]] addresses two different aspects of the topic of reality: the nature of reality itself, and the relationship between the [[mind]] (as well as [[language]] and [[culture]]) and reality.

On the one hand, [[ontology]] is the study of being, and the central topic of the field is couched, variously, in terms of being, existence, "what is", and reality. The task in ontology is to describe the most general [[category of being|categories of reality]] and how they are interrelated. If a philosopher wanted to proffer a positive definition of the concept "reality", it would be done under this heading. As explained above, some philosophers draw a distinction between reality and existence. In fact, many analytic philosophers today tend to avoid the term "real" and "reality" in discussing ontological issues. But for those who would treat "is real" the same way they treat "exists", one of the leading questions of analytic philosophy has been whether existence (or reality) is a property of objects. It has been widely held by analytic philosophers that it is ''not'' a property at all, though this view has lost some ground in recent decades.

On the other hand, particularly in discussions of [[Objectivity (philosophy)|objectivity]] that have feet in both [[metaphysics]] and [[epistemology]], philosophical discussions of "reality" often concern the ways in which reality is, or is not, in some way ''dependent upon'' (or, to use fashionable [[jargon]], "constructed" out of) mental and cultural factors such as perceptions, beliefs, and other mental states, as well as cultural artifacts, such as [[religion]]s and [[political movement]]s, on up to the vague notion of a common cultural [[world view]], or '''{{lang|de|[[Weltanschauung]]}}'''.

The view that there is a reality independent of any beliefs, perceptions, etc., is called [[Philosophical realism|realism]]. More specifically, philosophers are given to speaking about "realism ''about''" this and that, such as realism about universals or realism about the external world. Generally, where one can identify any class of object, the existence or essential characteristics of which is said not to depend on perceptions, beliefs, language, or any other human artifact, one can speak of "realism ''about''" that object.

One can also speak of ''anti''-realism about the same objects. ''[[Anti-realism]]'' is the latest in a long series of terms for views opposed to realism. Perhaps the first was [[idealism (philosophy)|idealism]], so called because reality was said to be in the mind, or a product of our ''ideas''. [[Berkeleyan idealism]] is the view, propounded by the Irish [[empiricism|empiricist]] [[George Berkeley]], that the objects of perception are actually ideas in the mind. In this view, one might be tempted to say that reality is a "mental construct"; this is not quite accurate, however, since, in Berkeley's view, perceptual ideas are created and coordinated by God. By the 20th century, views similar to Berkeley's were called [[phenomenalism]]. Phenomenalism differs from Berkeleyan idealism primarily in that Berkeley believed that minds, or souls, are not merely ideas nor made up of ideas, whereas varieties of phenomenalism, such as that advocated by [[Bertrand Russell|Russell]], tended to go farther to say that the mind itself is merely a collection of perceptions, memories, etc., and that there is no mind or soul over and above such [[mental event]]s. Finally, anti-realism became a fashionable term for ''any'' view which held that the existence of some object depends upon the mind or cultural artifacts. The view that the so-called external world is really merely a social, or cultural, artifact, called [[social constructionism]], is one variety of anti-realism. [[Cultural relativism]] is the view that [[social issues]] such as morality are not absolute, but at least partially [[cultural artifact]].

A [[correspondence theory]] of [[knowledge]] about what exists claims that "true" knowledge of reality represents accurate correspondence of statements about and images of reality with the actual reality that the statements or images are attempting to represent. For example, the [[scientific method]] can [[Empiricism|verify]] that a statement is true based on the observable evidence that a thing exists. Many humans can point to the [[Rocky Mountains]] and say that this [[mountain range]] exists, and continues to exist even if no one is observing it or making statements about it.

=== Being ===
The nature of [[being]] is a perennial topic in metaphysics. For, instance [[Parmenides]] taught that reality was a single unchanging Being, whereas [[Heraclitus]] wrote that all things flow. The 20th century philosopher [[Heidegger]] thought previous philosophers have lost sight the question of Being (qua Being) in favour of the questions of beings (existing things), so that a return to the Parmenidean approach was needed. An [[ontological catalogue]] is an attempt to list the fundamental constituents of reality. The question of whether or not [[existence]] is a [[wikt:predicate|predicate]] has been discussed since the Early Modern period, not least in relation to the [[ontological argument for the existence of God]]. Existence, ''that'' something is, has been contrasted with ''[[essence]]'', the question of ''what'' something is.
Since existence without essence seems blank, it associated with [[nothingness]] by philosophers such as Hegel. [[Nihilism]] represents an extremely negative view of being, the [[absolute (philosophy)|absolute]] a positive one.

=== Perception ===
The question of [[direct realism|direct or "naïve" realism]], as opposed to [[indirect realism|indirect or "representational" realism]], arises in the [[philosophy of perception]] and [[philosophy of mind|of mind]] out of the debate over the nature of [[Consciousness|conscious]] [[Qualia|experience]];&lt;ref name=lehar&gt;Lehar, Steve. (2000). [http://cns-alumni.bu.edu/~slehar/webstuff/consc1/consc1.html The Function of Conscious Experience: An Analogical Paradigm of Perception and Behavior], ''Consciousness and Cognition''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ce&gt;Lehar, Steve. (2000). [http://sharp.bu.edu/~slehar/epist/naive-philos.html Naïve Realism in Contemporary Philosophy] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120811172229/http://sharp.bu.edu/~slehar/epist/naive-philos.html |date=2012-08-11 }}, ''The Function of Conscious Experience''.&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Epistemology|epistemological]] question of whether the world we see around us is the real world itself or merely an internal perceptual copy of that world generated by [[neural]] processes in our [[Human brain|brain]]. [[Naïve realism]] is known as ''direct'' realism when developed to counter ''indirect'' or representative realism, also known as [[epistemological dualism]],&lt;ref&gt;Lehar, Steve. [http://sharp.bu.edu/~slehar/Representationalism.html Representationalism] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120905185905/http://sharp.bu.edu/~slehar/Representationalism.html |date=2012-09-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Philosophy|philosophical]] position that our conscious experience is not of the real world itself but of an internal representation, a miniature [[Virtual reality|virtual-reality]] replica of the world.

[[Timothy Leary]] coined the influential term [[Reality tunnel|Reality Tunnel]], by which he means a kind of [[representative realism]]. The theory states that, with a subconscious set of mental filters formed from their beliefs and experiences, every individual interprets the same world differently, hence "Truth is in the eye of the beholder". His ideas influenced the work of his friend [[Robert Anton Wilson]].

=== Abstract objects and mathematics ===
The status of [[Abstraction (mathematics)|abstract]] entities, particularly numbers, is a topic of discussion in mathematics.

In the [[philosophy of mathematics]], the best known form of realism about numbers is [[Platonic realism]], which grants them abstract, immaterial existence. Other forms of realism identify mathematics with the concrete physical universe.

Anti-realist stances include [[formalism (mathematics)|formalism]] and [[mathematical fictionalism|fictionalism]].

Some approaches are selectively realistic about some mathematical objects but not others. [[Finitism]] rejects [[Infinity|infinite]] quantities. [[Ultra-finitism]] accepts finite quantities up to a certain amount. [[Constructivism (mathematics)|Constructivism]] and [[intuitionism]] are realistic about objects that can be explicitly constructed, but reject the use of the [[principle of the excluded middle]] to prove existence by [[reductio ad absurdum]].

The traditional debate has focused on whether an abstract (immaterial, intelligible) realm of numbers has existed ''in addition to'' the physical (sensible, concrete) world. A recent development is the [[mathematical universe hypothesis]], the theory that ''only'' a mathematical world exists, with the finite, physical world being an illusion within it.

An extreme form of realism about mathematics is the [[mathematical multiverse hypothesis]] advanced by [[Max Tegmark]]. Tegmark's sole postulate is: ''All structures that exist mathematically also exist physically''. That is, in the sense that "in those [worlds] complex enough to contain self-aware substructures [they] will subjectively perceive themselves as existing in a physically 'real' world".&lt;ref name="Tegmark2008"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Tegmark |first=Max |date=February 2008 |title=The Mathematical Universe |journal=Foundations of Physics |volume=38 |issue=2 |pages=101–150 |doi=10.1007/s10701-007-9186-9 |arxiv=0704.0646|bibcode = 2008FoPh...38..101T }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tegmark (1998), p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; The hypothesis suggests that worlds corresponding to different sets of initial conditions, physical constants, or altogether different equations should be considered real. The theory can be considered a form of [[Platonism]] in that it posits the existence of mathematical entities, but can also be considered a [[philosophy of mathematics|mathematical monism]] in that it denies that anything exists except mathematical objects.

=== Properties ===
{{Main|Problem of universals}}

The problem of universals is an ancient problem in [[metaphysics]] about whether [[Universal (metaphysics)|universals]] exist. Universals are general or abstract qualities, characteristics, [[property (philosophy)|properties]], kinds or [[relation (philosophy)|relations]], such as being male/female, solid/liquid/gas or a certain colour,&lt;ref&gt;Loux (2001), p. 4&lt;/ref&gt; that can be predicated of individuals or particulars or that individuals or particulars can be regarded as sharing or participating in. For example, Scott, Pat, and Chris have in common the universal quality of ''being human'' or ''humanity''.

The realist school claims that universals are real&amp;nbsp;– they exist and are distinct from the particulars that instantiate them. There are various forms of realism. Two major forms are [[Platonic realism]] and [[Aristotelian realism]].&lt;ref&gt;Price (1953), among others, sometimes uses such Latin terms&lt;/ref&gt; ''Platonic realism'' is the view that universals are real entities and they exist independent of particulars. ''Aristotelian realism'', on the other hand, is the view that universals are real entities, but their existence is dependent on the particulars that exemplify them.

[[Nominalism]] and [[conceptualism]] are the main forms of anti-realism about universals.

=== Time and space ===
{{Main|Philosophy of space and time}}

A traditional [[Philosophical realism|realist]] position in [[ontology]] is that time and space have existence apart from the human mind. [[Idealism|Idealists]] deny or doubt the existence of objects independent of the mind. Some [[anti-realism|anti-realists]] whose ontological position is that objects outside the mind do exist, nevertheless doubt the independent existence of time and space.

[[Immanuel Kant|Kant]], in the ''[[Critique of Pure Reason]]'', described time as an ''[[A priori and a posteriori|a priori]]'' notion that, together with other ''a priori'' notions such as [[space]], allows us to comprehend [[empirical evidence|sense experience]]. Kant denies that either space or time are [[Substance theory|substance]], entities in themselves, or learned by experience; he holds rather that both are elements of a systematic framework we use to structure our experience. Spatial [[measurement]]s are used to [[quantity|quantify]] how far apart [[Physical body|objects]] are, and temporal measurements are used to quantitatively compare the interval between (or duration of) [[Spacetime#Basic concepts|events]]. Although
space and time are held to be ''transcendentally ideal'' in this sense, they are also ''empirically real'', i.e. not mere illusions.

Idealist writers such as [[J. M. E. McTaggart]] in ''[[The Unreality of Time]]'' have argued that time is an illusion.

As well as differing about the reality of time as a whole, metaphysical theories of [[time]] can differ in their ascriptions of reality to the [[past]], [[present]] and [[future]] separately.
* [[Presentism (philosophy of time)|Presentism]] holds that the past and future are unreal, and only an ever-changing present is real.
* The [[block universe]] theory, also known as Eternalism, holds that past, present and future are all real, but the passage of time is an illusion. It is often said to have a scientific basis in [[Theory of relativity|relativity]].
* The [[growing block universe]] theory holds that past and present are real, but the future is not.

Time, and the related concepts of process and [[evolution]] are central to the [[system-building metaphysics]] of [[A. N. Whitehead]] and [[Charles Hartshorne]].

=== Possible worlds ===
The term "[[possible world]]" goes back to [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz's]] theory of possible worlds, used to analyse necessity, [[Logical possibility|possibility]], and similar [[modal logic|modal notions]]. [[Modal realism]] is the view, notably propounded by [[David Kellogg Lewis]], that all [[possible worlds]] are as real as the actual world. In short: the actual world is regarded as merely one among an [[infinity|infinite]] [[set theory|set]] of [[logically possible]] worlds, some "nearer" to the actual world and some more remote. Other theorists may use the Possible World framework to express and explore problems without committing to it ontologically.
Possible world theory is related to [[alethic logic]]: a proposition is ''necessary'' if it is true in all possible worlds, and ''possible'' if it is true in at least one. The [[many worlds interpretation]] of quantum mechanics is a similar idea in science.

=== Theories of everything (TOE) and philosophy ===
{{Main|Theory of everything (philosophy)}}

The philosophical implications of a physical TOE are frequently debated. For example, if philosophical [[physicalism]] is true, a physical TOE will coincide with a philosophical theory of everything.

The [[System-building metaphysics|"system building"]] style of [[metaphysics]] attempts to answer ''all'' the important questions in a coherent way, providing a complete picture of the world. [[Plato]] and [[Aristotle]] could be said to be early examples of comprehensive systems. In the early modern period (17th and 18th centuries), the system-building ''scope'' of philosophy is often linked to the rationalist ''method'' of philosophy, that is the technique of deducing the nature of the world by pure ''a priori'' reason. Examples from the early modern period include the [[Gottfried Leibniz|Leibniz]]'s [[Monadology]], [[René Descartes|Descartes]]'s [[Mind-body dualism|Dualism]], [[Baruch Spinoza|Spinoza]]'s [[Monism]]. [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|Hegel]]'s [[Absolute idealism]] and [[Alfred North Whitehead|Whitehead]]'s [[Process philosophy]] were later systems.

Other philosophers do not believe its techniques can aim so high. Some scientists think a more mathematical approach than philosophy is needed for a TOE, for instance [[Stephen Hawking]] wrote in ''[[A Brief History of Time]]'' that even if we had a TOE, it would necessarily be a set of equations. He wrote, "What is it that breathes fire into the equations and makes a universe for them to describe?"&lt;ref&gt;as quoted in [Artigas, ''The Mind of the Universe'', p.123]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Phenomenological reality ===
On a much broader and more subjective level,{{Specify|date=August 2011}} private experiences, curiosity, inquiry, and the selectivity involved in personal interpretation of events shapes reality as seen by one and only one individual{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}} and hence is called [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenological]]. While this
form of reality might be common to others as well, it could at times also be so unique to oneself as to never be experienced or agreed upon by anyone else. Much of the kind of experience deemed [[Spirituality|spiritual]] occurs on this level of reality.

Phenomenology is a [[philosophical method]] developed in the early years of the twentieth century by [[Edmund Husserl]] and a circle of followers at the universities of [[Göttingen]] and [[Munich]] in [[Germany]]. Subsequently, phenomenological themes were taken up by philosophers in France, the United States, and elsewhere, often in contexts far removed from Husserl's work.

The word ''phenomenology'' comes from the [[Greek language|Greek]] ''phainómenon'', meaning "that which appears", and ''lógos'', meaning "study". In Husserl's conception, phenomenology is primarily concerned with making the structures of [[consciousness]], and the [[phenomena]] which appear in acts of consciousness, objects of systematic reflection and analysis. Such reflection was to take place from a highly modified "[[First-person narrative|first person]]" viewpoint, studying phenomena not as they appear to "my" consciousness, but to any consciousness whatsoever. Husserl believed that phenomenology could thus provide a firm basis for all human [[knowledge]], including scientific knowledge, and could establish philosophy as a "rigorous science".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = Joseph Kockelmans | year = 2001 | title = Edmund Husserl's phenomenology | edition = 2 | publisher = [[Purdue University]] Press | pages = 311–314 | isbn = 1-55753-050-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Husserl's conception of phenomenology has been criticised and developed not only by himself, but also by his student and assistant [[Martin Heidegger]], by [[existentialists]], such as [[Maurice Merleau-Ponty]], [[Jean-Paul Sartre]], and by other philosophers, such as [[Paul Ricoeur]], [[Emmanuel Levinas]], and [[Dietrich von Hildebrand]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = Steven Galt Crowell | year = 2001 | title = Husserl, Heidegger, and the space of meaning: paths toward transcendental phenomenology | publisher = [[Northwestern University]] Press | page = 160 | isbn = 0-8101-1805-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Skeptical hypotheses ===

Skeptical hypotheses in philosophy suggest that reality is very different from what we think it is; or at least that we cannot prove it is not. Examples include:

* The "[[Brain in a vat]]" hypothesis is cast in scientific terms. It supposes that one might be a disembodied brain kept alive in a vat, and fed false sensory signals, by a [[mad scientist]]. This is a premise of the film series, [[Matrix hypothesis]].
* The "[[Dream argument]]" of Descartes and [[Zhuang Zhou|Zhuangzi]] supposes reality to be indistinguishable from a dream.
* Descarte's [[Evil demon]] is a being "as clever and deceitful as he is powerful, who has directed his entire effort to misleading me."
* The [[five minute hypothesis]] (or [[omphalos hypothesis]] or [[Last Thursdayism]]) suggests that the world was created recently together with records and traces indicating a greater age.
* The Matrix hypothesis or [[Simulated reality hypothesis]] suggest that we might be inside a [[computer simulation]] or [[virtual reality]].

== Jain philosophy ==
{{Main|Tattva (Jainism)}}
[[Jain philosophy]] postulates that seven '''tattva''' (truths or fundamental principles) constitute reality.{{sfn|S.A. Jain|1992|p=6}} These seven ''tattva'' are:{{sfn|S.A. Jain|1992|p=7}}
#''[[Jiva|Jīva]]'' – The [[Soul (Jainism)|soul]] which is characterized by consciousness.
#''[[Ajiva|Ajīva]]'' – The non-soul.
#''[[Asrava]]'' – Influx of [[Karma in Jainism|karma]].
#''[[Bandha (Jainism)|Bandha]]'' – The bondage of karma.
#''[[Samvara]]'' – Obstruction of the inflow of karmic matter into the soul.
#''[[Nirjara]]'' – Shedding of karmas.
#''[[Moksha (Jainism)|Moksha]]'' – Liberation or Salvation, i.e. the complete annihilation of all karmic matter (bound with any particular soul).

== Physical sciences ==

=== Scientific realism ===
[[Scientific realism]] is, at the most general level, the view that the world described by science (perhaps ideal science) is the real world, as it is, independent of what we might take it to be. Within [[philosophy of science]], it is often framed as an answer to the question "how is the success of science to be explained?" The debate over what the success of science involves centers primarily on the status of entities that are [[unobservable|not directly observable]] discussed by [[scientific theory|scientific theories]]. Generally, those who are scientific realists state that one can make reliable claims about these entities (viz., that they have the same [[Ontology|ontological]] status) as directly observable entities, as opposed to [[instrumentalism]]. The most used and studied scientific theories today state more or less the truth.

=== Realism and locality in physics ===
''Realism'' in the sense used by physicists does not equate to [[Philosophical realism|realism]] in [[metaphysics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Against `Realism'|first=Travis|last=Norsen|date=26 February 2007|publisher=|journal=Foundations of Physics|volume=37|issue=3|pages=311–340|doi=10.1007/s10701-007-9104-1|arxiv=quant-ph/0607057|bibcode=2007FoPh...37..311N}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The latter is the claim that the world is mind-independent: that even if the results of a measurement do not pre-exist the act of measurement, that does not require that they are the creation of the observer. Furthermore, a mind-independent property does not have to be the value of some physical variable such as position or [[momentum]]. A property can be ''[[disposition]]al'' (or potential), i.e. it can be a tendency: in the way that glass objects tend to break, or are disposed to break, even if they do not ''actually'' break. Likewise, the mind-independent properties of quantum systems could consist of a tendency to respond to particular measurements with particular values with ascertainable probability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.generativescience.org/|title=Generative Science|first=Ian|last=Thompson|website=www.generativescience.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such an ontology would be metaphysically realistic, without being realistic in the physicist's sense of "local realism" (which would require that a single value be produced with certainty).

A closely related term is [[counterfactual definiteness]] (CFD), used to refer to the claim that one can meaningfully speak of the definiteness of results of measurements that have not been performed (i.e. the ability to assume the existence of objects, and properties of objects, even when they have not been measured).

[[Local realism]] is a significant feature of classical mechanics, of [[general relativity]], and of [[electrodynamics]]; but [[quantum mechanics]] has shown that [[quantum entanglement]] is possible. This was rejected by Einstein, who proposed the [[EPR paradox]], but it was subsequently quantified by [[Bell's inequalities]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bendov.info/eng/crucial.htm|title=Local realism and the crucial experiment|website=bendov.info}}&lt;/ref&gt; If Bell's inequalities are violated, either local realism ''or'' [[counterfactual definiteness]] must be incorrect; but some physicists dispute that experiments have demonstrated Bell's violations, on the grounds that the sub-class of [[Bells Theorem#Two classes of Bell inequalities|inhomogeneous Bell inequalities]] has not been tested or due to [[Bell test loopholes|experimental limitations in the tests]]. Different [[interpretation of quantum mechanics|interpretations of quantum mechanics]] violate different parts of local realism and/or [[counterfactual definiteness]].

=== Role of the observer in quantum mechanics ===
{{See also|Quantum decoherence}}
The quantum mind–body problem refers to the philosophical discussions of the [[mind–body problem]] in the context of [[quantum mechanics]]. Since quantum mechanics involves [[quantum superposition]]s, which [[Measurement in quantum mechanics|are not perceived by observers]], some [[interpretations of quantum mechanics]] place conscious observers in a special position.

The founders of quantum mechanics debated the role of the observer, and of them, [[Wolfgang Pauli]] and [[Werner Heisenberg]] believed that it was the observer that produced [[wave function collapse|collapse]]. This point of view, which was never fully endorsed by [[Niels Bohr]], was denounced as mystical and anti-scientific by [[Albert Einstein]]. Pauli accepted the term, and described quantum mechanics as ''lucid mysticism''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Juan Miguel Marin|year=2009|title='Mysticism' in quantum mechanics: the forgotten controversy|journal=European Journal of Physics|volume=30|issue=4|pages=807–822|bibcode=2009EJPh...30..807M|doi=10.1088/0143-0807/30/4/014}} [http://www.iop.org/EJ/article/0143-0807/30/4/014/ejp9_4_014.pdf?request-id=9350419a-e5ea-42e2-b5f3-7878a09dfe42 link], summarized here [http://www.physorg.com/news163670588.html%7care/] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110606092933/http://www.physorg.com/news163670588.html%7Care/|date=2011-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Heisenberg and Bohr always described quantum mechanics in [[logical positivism|logical positivist]] terms. Bohr also took an active interest in the philosophical implications of quantum theories such as his [[Complementarity (physics)|complementarity]], for example.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal=Zygon: Journal of Religion &amp; Science |author=John Honner |title= Niels Bohr and the Mysticism of Nature |volume=17-3 |pages=243–253 |year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; He believed quantum theory offers a complete description of nature, albeit one that is simply ill-suited for everyday experiences&amp;nbsp;– which are better described by classical mechanics and probability. Bohr never specified a demarcation line above which objects cease to be quantum and become classical. He believed that it was not a question of physics, but one of philosophy.

[[Eugene Wigner]] reformulated the "[[Schrödinger's cat]]" [[thought experiment]] as "[[Wigner's friend]]" and proposed that the consciousness of an observer is the demarcation line which precipitates [[Wave function collapse|collapse of the wave function]], independent of any realist interpretation. Commonly known as "[[consciousness causes collapse]]", this [[Interpretation of quantum mechanics|interpretation]] of quantum mechanics states that [[observation]] by a [[conscious]] observer is what makes the wave function collapse.

=== Multiverse ===
The [[multiverse]] is the [[hypothetical]] set of multiple possible [[universe]]s (including the historical universe we consistently experience) that together comprise everything that [[Existence|exists]]: the entirety of [[space]], [[time]], [[matter]], and [[energy]] as well as the [[physical law]]s and [[physical constant|constants]] that describe them. The term was coined in 1895 by the American philosopher and psychologist [[William James]].&lt;ref&gt;James, William, ''The Will to Believe'', 1895; and earlier in 1895, as cited in [[OED]]'s new 2003 entry for "multiverse": "1895 W. JAMES in Internat. Jrnl. Ethics 6 10 Visible nature is all plasticity and indifference, a multiverse, as one might call it, and not a universe."&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[many-worlds interpretation]] (MWI), one of the mainstream [[interpretations of quantum mechanics]], there are an infinite number of universes and every possible quantum outcome occurs in at least one universe.

The structure of the multiverse, the nature of each universe within it and the relationship between the various constituent universes, depend on the specific multiverse hypothesis considered. Multiverses have been hypothesized in [[cosmology]], [[physics]], [[astronomy]], [[religion]], [[philosophy]], [[transpersonal psychology]] and [[fiction]], particularly in [[science fiction]] and [[fantasy]]. In these contexts, parallel universes are also called "alternative universes", "quantum universes", "interpenetrating dimensions", "parallel dimensions", "parallel worlds", "alternative realities", "alternative timelines", and "dimensional planes", among others.

=== Scientific theories of everything ===
A [[theory of everything]] (TOE) is a putative [[theory]] of [[theoretical physics]] that fully explains and links together all known physical phenomena, and predicts the outcome of ''any'' experiment that could be carried out ''in principle''. The theory of everything is also called the '''final theory'''.&lt;ref&gt;Weinberg (1993)&lt;/ref&gt; Many candidate theories of everything have been proposed by theoretical physicists during the twentieth century, but none have been confirmed experimentally. The primary problem in producing a TOE is that [[general relativity]] and [[quantum mechanics]] are hard to unify. This is one of the [[unsolved problems in physics]].

Initially, the term "theory of everything" was used with an ironic connotation to refer to various overgeneralized theories. For example, a great-grandfather of [[Ijon Tichy]], a character from a cycle of [[Stanisław Lem]]'s [[science fiction]] stories of the 1960s, was known to work on the "General Theory of Everything". Physicist [[John Ellis (physicist)|John Ellis]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

 | year = 2002

|bibcode = 2002Natur.415..957E

 | pmid=11875539}}&lt;/ref&gt; claims to have introduced the term into the technical literature in an article in ''[[Nature (magazine)|Nature]]'' in 1986.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

 | issue=6089}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over time, the term stuck in popularizations of [[quantum physics]] to describe a theory that would unify or explain through a single model the theories of all [[fundamental interaction]]s and of all particles of nature: [[general relativity]] for gravitation, and the [[Standard Model|standard model]] of elementary particle physics&amp;nbsp;– which includes quantum mechanics&amp;nbsp;– for electromagnetism, the two nuclear interactions, and the known elementary particles.

Current candidates for a theory of everything include [[string theory]], [[M theory]], and [[loop quantum gravity]].

== Technology ==

=== Virtual reality and cyberspace ===
[[Virtual reality]] (VR) is a [[Computer simulation|computer-simulated]] environment that can simulate physical presence in places in the real world, as well as in imaginary worlds.

[[File:Virtuality Continuum 2.jpg|thumb|right|400px|Reality-Virtuality Continuum.]]The [[Virtuality Continuum]] is a continuous scale ranging between the completely virtual, a [[Virtual Reality|Virtuality]], and the completely real: Reality. The reality-virtuality continuum therefore encompasses all possible variations and compositions of real and [[Virtuality|virtual]] objects. It has been described as a concept in [[new media]] and [[computer science]], but in fact it could be considered a matter of [[anthropology]]. The concept was first introduced by Paul Milgram.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference|first=Paul |last=Milgram |author2=H. Takemura |author3=A. Utsumi |author4=F. Kishino |title=Augmented Reality: A class of displays on the reality-virtuality continuum |booktitle=Proceedings of Telemanipulator and Telepresence Technologies |pages=2351–34 |year=1994 |url=http://vered.rose.utoronto.ca/publication/1994/Milgram_Takemura_SPIE1994.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=2007-03-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061004044435/https://vered.rose.utoronto.ca/publication/1994/Milgram_Takemura_SPIE1994.pdf |archivedate=2006-10-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The area between the two extremes, where both the real and the virtual are mixed, is the so-called [[Mixed reality]]. This in turn is said to consist of both [[Augmented Reality]], where the virtual augments the real, and [[Augmented virtuality]], where the real augments the virtual.
[[Cyberspace]], the world's computer systems considered as an interconnected whole, can be thought of as a virtual reality; for instance, it is portrayed as such in the [[cyberpunk]] fiction of [[William Gibson]] and others. [[Second life]] and [[MMORPG]]s such as ''[[World of Warcraft]]'' are examples of artificial environments or [[virtual world]]s (falling some way short of full virtual reality) in cyberspace.

=== "RL" in internet culture ===
On the Internet, "[[real life]]" refers to life in the real world. It generally references [[Conditio humana|life]] or [[consensus reality]], in contrast to an environment seen as [[fiction]] or [[fantasy]], such as [[virtual reality]], [[lifelike experience]], [[dream]]s, [[novel]]s, or [[film|movies]]. Online, the [[acronym]] "IRL" stands for "in real life", with the meaning "not on the Internet".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=AcronymFinder.com search for IRL |url=http://www.acronymfinder.com/af-query.asp?String=exact&amp;Acronym=IRL}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sociologist]]s engaged in the study of the Internet have determined that someday, a distinction between online and real-life worlds may seem "quaint", noting that certain types of online activity, such as sexual intrigues, have already made a full transition to complete legitimacy and "reality".&lt;ref name=Slater&gt;{{cite book |chapter=Social Relationships and Identity On-line and Off-line |title=Handbook of New Media: Social Shaping and Consequences of ICTs |editors=Leah, Sonia, Lievrouw, and Livingstone |author=Don Slater |pages=533–543 |year=2002 |publisher=Sage Publications Inc |isbn=0-7619-6510-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[abbreviation]] "RL" stands for "real life". For example, one can speak of "meeting in RL" someone whom one has met in a [[online chat|chat]] or on an [[Internet forum]]. It may also be used to express an inability to use the Internet for a time due to "RL problems".

''' RideLondon''', known through sponsorship as '''Prudential RideLondon''', is an annual festival of cycling held in [[London]].  It was developed by the [[Mayor of London]], [[London and Partners]] and [[Transport for London]] in partnership with [[Surrey County Council]], and is managed by London &amp; Surrey Cycling Partnership.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}

The festival was designed as an annual legacy from the London 2012 Olympic Games and first held in 2013. The format consists of a series of cycling events on closed roads around London and [[Surrey]] for amateur [[cyclist]]s and professionals, culminating in the [[London–Surrey Classic]], a one-day international [[road cycling]].{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}

==Overview==
Prudential RideLondon is composed of a number of events taking place the weekend following the end of the Tour de France at the end of July every year.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}

===Prudential RideLondon FreeCycle===
Taking place on the Saturday, the Prudential RideLondon FreeCycle offers an opportunity for people of all ages to cycle on traffic-free roads in Central London, passing landmarks such as [[Buckingham Palace]], the [[Bank of England]], the [[Houses of Parliament]] and [[St Paul's Cathedral]]. Alongside the FreeCycle route, there are also seven festival zones, all of which have a variety of bike-based activates riders can get involved in.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}

===Prudential RideLondon Classique===
The Prudential RideLondon Classique is a [[UCI Women's WorldTour]] race on the Saturday evening on a 5.5&amp;nbsp;km circuit in central London, beginning and finishing on [[The Mall, London|The Mall]]. The women’s elite race, previously known as the Grand Prix pro race, was given UCI World Tour Status in 2016 and has the highest ever value prize money for a women’s one-day race. This is also the same prize money as won in the men’s elite race, despite the lessened interest.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.prudentialridelondon.co.uk/events/classique/prizes/prize-money/|title=Prize Money|website=www.prudentialridelondon.co.uk|access-date=2018-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Prudential RideLondon-Surrey 100===  
The Prudential RideLondon-Surrey 100 takes place on the Sunday. Over 25,000 amateur cyclists start in Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park, then cycle through the capital and onto Surrey's country roads and the [[Surrey Hills AONB|Surrey Hills]] before a finish on The Mall in central London.  Many of the riders are sponsored for charities: £12.5 million was raised for charity in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.londonandpartners.com/media-centre/press-releases/2016/20160120prudential-ridelondon-raises-recordbreaking-12-million-for-charity|title=Prudential Ridelondon raises record-breaking £12 million for charity|website=www.londonandpartners.com|accessdate=30 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Prudential RideLondon-Surrey 46===
First established in 2016, the Prudential RideLondon-Surrey 46 takes place on the Sunday morning. The 46-mile route on traffic-free roads begins at [[Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park]] in east London and follows the same route as the Prudential RideLondon-Surrey 100 for the first 27 miles before linking to with the last 17 miles through London to the finish in The Mall.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}

===Prudential RideLondon-Surrey Classic=== 
The Prudential RideLondon-Surrey Classic on the Sunday, is a UCI WorldTour event which follows largely the same route as the Prudential RideLondon-Surrey 100 sportive with multiple circuits in and around [[Dorking]].{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}

===Brompton World Championship=== 
The [[Brompton World Championship]] first became part of the RideLondon cycling festival in 2015. The event involves 550 Brompton riders racing around a central London circuit on the iconic foldable bikes and ends with a sprint finish on The Mall. Riders are generally dressed in suits, due to the strict no lycra rule in order to reflect the Brompton bikes place in a modern-day commuter lifestyle.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}

===Prudential RideLondon HandCycle Races and Junior Races=== 
The prudential RideLondon HandCycle and Junior races are also included in the RideLondon weekend. The elite HandCycle event has been won by Rafal Wilk of Poland in 2016 and 2017 while Christine Reppe of Germany won the women’s elite handcycle in 2017. The amateur handcycle event is for injured veteran servicemen and women. The Junior categories feature boys and girls races for 13–16 years old. {{citation needed|date=July 2018}}

==History==

===Origins===
The origins of RideLondon can be traced back to when London was awarded the rights to stage the 2012 [[Olympic Games|Olympic]] &amp; [[Paralympic Games]]. Subsequently, London has staged a number of cycling events. In 2007, London hosted the [[Tour de France]] Grand Depart and also closed roads to create a day-long safe cycling environment in city centre, known at the time as [[The London Freewheel]]. This annual one day event continued between 2007-2011 and from 2009 became known as the Mayor of London's Skyride.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}

Ambition to create a new world-class event for cycling, that could one day rival London's most iconic sporting events such as the [[London Marathon]] and the [[Wimbledon Championships]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ft.com/content/a36d44fe-cc0b-11e1-aac1-00144feabdc0|title=Subscribe to read|website=Financial Times|accessdate=30 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; was born. The aim of the annual event is to include the world's top men, women and hand cyclists racing as part of the international cycling calendar in order to challenge and inspire people from all backgrounds to get on two wheels. In late 2011 and early 2012, Mayor [[Boris Johnson]] assessed and formally approved the recommendation to create the event &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.london.gov.uk/press-releases-4850|title=Mayor announces world class cycling festival|website=London City Hall|accessdate=30 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and, at the start of the Olympic year, the search for a suitably qualified and experienced Delivery Partner was launched.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.london.gov.uk/press-releases-4788|title=Six race organisers shortlisted to run London Festival of Cycling|website=London City Hall|accessdate=30 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
After detailed work, a joint venture including the organisers of London Marathon and the [[Tour of Britain]] under the name of the London &amp; Surrey Cycling Partnership was selected to make the event a reality. The event would be delivered in partnership with [[Surrey County Council]] and include a route through the Surrey Hills, which also mirrored the London Olympic Games road race. The event is part of the London 2012 Olympic legacy.

In August 2012, as the Olympic Games drew to a close, the Mayor of London and the London &amp; Surrey Cycling Partnership, alongside British Cycling and double Olympic champion [[Laura Kenny|Laura Trott]], formally launched RideLondon &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.london.gov.uk/press-releases-4616|title=Mayor announces world class RideLondon event|website=London City Hall|accessdate=30 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and called for fans to sign up to the 100-mile challenge.
The event's first title sponsor, Prudential, was announced in early 2013 &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.londonandpartners.com/media-centre/press-releases/2013/130207-prudential-to-sponsor-mayors-ridelondon-festival-of-cycling|title=Prudential to sponsor Mayor's RideLondon Festival of Cycling|website=www.londonandpartners.com|accessdate=30 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; by which time more than 55,000 people had signed up to be one of the first riders to participate in the inaugural RideLondon-Surrey 100. This race is part of the Prudential RideLondon festival weekend with coverage to be broadcast live on [[BBC]] and international TV.

The RideLondon vision was to showcase the capital to nationwide and international audiences, generate economic benefit from participant and spectator expenditure and inspire more people to take up regular cycling.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}

===2013 Event===
In its first year, more than 16,000 people started the RideLondon-Surrey 100, more than 50,000 took part in RideLondon FreeCycle and over 1,000 volunteers helped run the event. 99% of participants rated the event as good or excellent and riders in the RideLondon-Surrey 100 raised more than £7 million for charity.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.londonandpartners.com/media-centre/press-releases/2014/140807-sir-bradley-wiggins-to-race-in-prudential-ridelondonsurrey-classic&lt;/ref&gt;

===2014 Event===
In 2014, over 16,000 completed the RideLondon-Surrey 100 (shortened to 86 miles due to adverse weather conditions) with 60,000 taking part in the FreeCycle &lt;ref&gt;http://www.londonandpartners.com/media-centre/press-releases/2014/140811-a-fantastic-advert-for-cycling-says-mayor-boris-johnson&lt;/ref&gt; and more than £10 million being raised for charity by riders in the RideLondon-Surrey 100. This set a new record for a UK one-day cycling event for a second successive year.

===2015 Event===
In response to the huge demand for the event, places were increased by 25 per cent in 2015, with more than 25,000 riders crossing the Start Line in Queen Elizabeth Park Olympic Park on 2 August.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.londonandpartners.com/media-centre/press-releases/2015/150803-mayor-boris-johnson-hails-the-worlds-greatest-cycling-festival&lt;/ref&gt;
This year a new event was also added to the RideLondon cycling festival; the 10th Brompton Bicycle World Championship Final. This event which featured in the RideLondon Grand Prix races in St James's Park and was the first time that the Brompton World Championship Final had been held in London. The event opened with a Le Mans-style start as 500 smartly-dressed competitors from around the world made a mad dash to unfold their bikes before setting off on the circuit. Six Festival Zones (up from five in 2014) in RideLondon FreeCycle offered riders a chance to stop and enjoy a huge range of free bike-based entertainment and to try out many different bike-based activities. The women's RideLondon Grand Prix race was also one of the biggest one-day races on the international calendar and was again televised live by the BBC.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}

===2016 Event===
In 2016, a new 46 mile event was launched by Bradley Wiggins specifically for newer and younger cyclists. The RideLondon-Surrey 46 on traffic-free roads starts at Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park, and follows the same route as RideLondon-Surrey 100 for the first 27 miles before taking a new two-mile route, which then links up with the last 17 miles to the finish in The Mall.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}

A new format for the RideLondon Grand Prix was also announced. From 2016 it is to be held at the Lee Valley Velopark in Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park and include handcycle, junior and BMX races for the first time.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}

===2017 Event===
In 2017, the RideLondon-Surrey Classic and RideLondon Classique both gained UCI WorldTour status and became the richest one-day races in cycling offering equal prize money for both the men's and women's races.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.prudentialridelondon.co.uk/news-media/latest-news/2017-prudential-ridelondon-surrey-classic-makes-history/&lt;/ref&gt; Riders in the RideLondon-Surrey 100 and RideLondon-Surrey 46 together raised £12.75 million for charity.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.londonandpartners.com/media-centre/press-releases/2017/181217-ridelondon-cyclists-raise-127-million-for-charity-in-2017&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Roman Empire]], '''Rosalia''' or '''Rosaria''' was a festival of [[roses]] celebrated on various dates, primarily in [[Maius|May]], but scattered through mid-July. The observance is sometimes called a '''''rosatio''''' ("rose-adornment") or the '''''dies rosationis''''', "day of rose-adornment," and could be celebrated also with [[Viola (plant)|violets]] ''(violatio'', an adorning with violets, also ''dies violae'' or ''dies violationis'', "day of the {{nowrap|violet[-adornment]}}").&lt;ref&gt;C.R. Phillips, ''The Oxford Classical Dictionary,'' edited by Simon Hornblower and Anthony Spawforth (Oxford University Press, 1996, 3rd edition), p. 1335; ''[[Corpus Inscriptionum Latinarum|CIL]]'' 6.10264, 10239, 10248 and others. Other names include ''dies rosalis,'' ''dies rosae'' and ''dies rosaliorum'': ''CIL'' 3.7576, 6.10234, 6.10239, 6. 10248.&lt;/ref&gt; As a commemoration of the dead, the ''rosatio'' developed from the custom of placing flowers at burial sites. It was among the extensive private religious practices by means of which the [[ancient Romans|Romans]] cared for their dead, reflecting the value placed on tradition ''([[mos maiorum]]'', "the way of the ancestors"), [[gens|family lineage]], and memorials ranging from simple inscriptions to grand public works. Several dates on the [[Roman calendar]] were set aside as public holidays or [[memorial day]]s devoted to the dead.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Toohey, "Death and Burial in the Ancient World," in ''The Oxford Encyclopedia of Ancient Greece and Rome'' (Oxford University Press, 2010), pp. 366–367.&lt;/ref&gt;

As a religious expression, a ''rosatio'' might also be offered to the cult statue of a deity or to other revered objects. In May, the [[Imperial Roman army|Roman army]] celebrated the '''''Rosaliae signorum''''', rose festivals at which they adorned the [[Roman military standard|military standards]] with [[garland]]s. The rose festivals of private associations and clubs are documented by at least forty-one inscriptions in Latin and sixteen in Greek, where the observance is often called a ''rhodismos''.&lt;ref&gt;Christina Kokkinia, "Rosen für die Toten im griechischen Raum und eine neue Rodismos Bithynien," ''Museum Helveticum'' 56 (1999), pp. 209–210, noting that ''rhodismos'' is attested in [[glosses]] as equivalent to ''rosalia''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Flowers were traditional symbols of rejuvenation, rebirth, and memory, with the red and purple of roses and violets felt to evoke the color of blood as a form of propitiation.&lt;ref&gt;Patricia Cox Miller, ''The Corporeal Imagination: Signifying the Holy in Late Ancient Christianity'' (University of Pennsylvania Press, 2009), p. 74.&lt;/ref&gt; Their blooming period framed the season of spring, with roses the last of the flowers to bloom and violets the earliest.&lt;ref&gt;Christer Henriksén, ''A Commentary on Martial, ''Epigrams'' Book 9'' (Oxford University Press, 2012), p. 59, citing [[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]], ''Natural History'' 21.64–65 and [[Martial]], ''Epigram'' 9.11.1.&lt;/ref&gt; As part of both festive and funerary banquets, roses adorned "a strange repast ... of life and death together, considered as two aspects of the same endless, unknown process."&lt;ref&gt;[[:ro:Marcu Beza|Marcu Beza]], ''Paganism in Romanian Folklore'' (J.M. Dent, 1928), p. 43.&lt;/ref&gt; In some areas of the Empire, the Rosalia was [[syncretism|assimilated]] to floral elements of spring festivals for [[Dionysus]], [[Adonis]] and others, but rose-adornment as a practice was not strictly tied to the [[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#cultus|cultivation]] of particular deities, and thus lent itself to Jewish and Christian commemoration.&lt;ref&gt;A.S. Hooey, "Rosaliae signorum," ''Harvard Theological Review'' 30.1 (1937), p. 30; Kathleen E. Corley, ''Marantha: Women's Funerary Rituals and Christian Origins'' (Fortress Press, 2010), p. 19; Kokkinia, "Rosen für die Toten," p. 208; on Jewish commemoration, Paul Trebilco, ''Jewish Communities in Asia Minor'' (Cambridge University Press, 1991, 1994 reprint), pp. 78–81.&lt;/ref&gt; Early Christian writers transferred the imagery of garlands and crowns of roses and violets to the [[cult of saints|cult of the saints]].

==Cultural and religious background==
[[File:The Roses of Heliogabalus.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|''[[The Roses of Heliogabalus]]''  (1888) by [[Lawrence Alma-Tadema]]: "suffocation by erotically charged flowers" became a ''[[Literary topos|topos]]'' of the late 19th century&lt;ref&gt;Cristina Mazzoni, ''Saint Hysteria: Neurosis, Mysticism, and Gender in European Culture'' (Cornell University Press, 1996), p. 142.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
In Greece and Rome, wreaths and garlands of flowers and greenery were worn by both men and women for festive occasions.&lt;ref&gt;Mireille M. Lee, "Clothing," in ''The Oxford Encyclopedia of Ancient Greece and Rome,'' p. 231.&lt;/ref&gt; Garlands of roses and violets, combined or singly, adorn erotic scenes, bridal processions, and [[symposium|drinking parties]] in [[Greek lyric poetry]] from the [[Archaic Greece|Archaic period]] onward.&lt;ref&gt;[[C. M. Bowra]], ''Greek Lyric Poetry: From Alcman to Simonides'' pp. 108, 191, 264; Patricia A. Rosenmeyer, ''The Poetics of Imitation: Anacreon and the Anacreontic Tradition'' (Cambridge University Press, 1992), ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=rIqsUZyYMQAC&amp;q=roses#v=snippet&amp;q=roses&amp;f=false passim.]''&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Latin literature]], to be "in the roses and violets" meant experiencing carefree pleasure.&lt;ref&gt;Henriksén, ''A Commentary on Martial,'' p. 59, citing [[Cicero]], ''Tusculan Disputations'' 5.73.&lt;/ref&gt;  Floral wreaths and garlands "mark the wearers as celebrants and likely serve as an expression of the beauty and brevity of life itself."&lt;ref&gt;Karen K. Hersch, ''The Roman Wedding: Ritual and Meaning in Antiquity'' (Cambridge University Press, 2010), p. 91.&lt;/ref&gt; Roses and violets were the most popular flowers at Rome for wreaths, which were sometimes given as gifts.&lt;ref&gt;Henriksén, ''A Commentary on Martial,'' p. 256, citing [[Martial]] 9.60; [[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]], ''[[Natural History (Pliny)|Natural History]]'' 21.14; [[Ovid]], ''[[Metamorphoses]]'' 12.410; [[Statius]], ''Silvae'' 1.2.22. [[Ludwig Friedländer]], ''Roman Life and Manners under the Early Empire'', translated by A.B. Gough (Routledge,1913), vol. 4, pp. 144–145, notes that Roman ''violae'' may at times refer to the [[Erysimum|wallflower]] or [[Matthiola|stock]] as well as violets.&lt;/ref&gt;

Flowers were associated with or offered to some deities, particularly the goddesses [[Aphrodite]] (Roman [[Venus (mythology)|Venus]]), [[Persephone]]&lt;ref&gt;Monica S. Cyrino, ''Aphrodite'' (Routledge, 2010), p. 36; ''Corinth. The Sanctuary of Demeter and Kore: Terracotta Figurines of the Classical, Hellenistic, and Roman Periods'' (ASCSA, 2000), vol. 18, pt. 4, pp. 124–125.&lt;/ref&gt; ([[Proserpina]]), and [[Chloris]]&lt;ref&gt;Ada Cohen, "Mythic Landscapes of Greece," in ''The Cambridge Companion to Greek Mythology'' (Cambridge University Press, 2007), p. 316.&lt;/ref&gt; ([[Flora (mythology)|Flora]]). Roses and fragrances are a special attribute of Aphrodite,&lt;ref&gt;Cyrino, ''Aphrodite,'' pp. 35–39; Ian Du Quesnay, "Three Problems in Poem 66," in ''Catullus: Poems, Books, Reader'' (Cambridge University Press, 2012), pp. 165–166.&lt;/ref&gt; and also of [[Dionysus]], particularly in Imperial-era poetry as a wine god for drinking parties or with the presence of [[Eros]] ("Love, Desire").&lt;ref&gt;[[M.L. West]], "The ''Anacreontea''," in ''Hellenica: Selected Papers on Greek Literature and Thought. Volume II: Lyric and Drama'' (Oxford University Press, 2013), vol. 2, pp. 388–389; Laura Miguélez-Cavero, ''Poems in Context: Greek Poetry in the Egyptian Thebaid 200-600 AD'' (Walter de Gruyter, 2008), pp. 130–134 (on the wine of Dionysus as having a potent fragrance that competes with that of flowers such as roses); Xavier Riu, ''Dionysism and Comedy'' (Rowman &amp; Littlefield, 1999), p. 108; Edoarda Barra-Salzédo, ''En soufflant la grâce: Âmes, souffles et humeurs en Grèce ancienne'' (Jérôme Villon, 2007),  p. 178.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[ancient Greek novel|Greek romance novel]] ''[[Daphnis and Chloe]]'' (2nd century AD) describes a [[pleasure garden]], with roses and violets among its abundant flora, centered on a sacred space for Dionysus.&lt;ref&gt;A.R. Littlewood, "Ancient Literary Evidence for the Pleasure Gardens of Roman Country Villas," in ''Ancient Roman villa Gardens,'' Dumbarton Oaks Colloquium on the History of Landscape Architecture 10 (Dumbarton Oaks, 1987), p. 28.&lt;/ref&gt; At Rome Venus was a goddess of gardens as well as love and beauty.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Lipka, ''Roman Gods: A Conceptual Approach'' (Brill, 2009), p. 42.&lt;/ref&gt; Venus received roses at her ritual cleansing ''(lavatio)'' on [[Veneralia|April 1]] and at the wine festival ([[Vinalia]]) celebrated in her honor April 23.&lt;ref&gt;Ovid, ''Fasti'' 4.138 and 869f.; Hooey, "Rosaliae signorum," p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt;

A lavish display of flowers was an expression of conviviality and liberal generosity. An Imperial-era [[business letter]] surviving on [[Papyri|papyrus]] attempts to soothe a [[bridegroom]]'s mother upset that the rose harvest was insufficient to fill her order for the wedding; the suppliers compensated by sending 4,000 narcissus instead of the 2,000 she requested.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Oxyrhynchus Papyri]]'' 331.1–21; ''The Oxford Encyclopedia of Ancient Greece and Rome,'' p. 30.&lt;/ref&gt; While flowers were a part of Roman weddings, the bridegroom was more likely than the bride to wear a flower crown; [[Statius]] (1st century AD) describes a groom as wearing a wreath of roses, violets, and [[lily|lilies]].&lt;ref&gt;Statius, ''Silvae'' 1.20; Hersch, ''The Roman Wedding,'' p. 90.&lt;/ref&gt; When the [[Roman emperor|emperor]] made a formal arrival ''([[Adventus (ceremony)|adventus]])'' at a city, garlands of flowers might be among the gestures of greeting from the welcome delegation.&lt;ref&gt;"Triumph," in ''The Oxford Encyclopedia of Ancient Greece eand Rome,'' p. 123.&lt;/ref&gt; According to an account in the ''[[Historia Augusta]]'' ("presumably fictional"), the decadent emperor [[Elagabalus|Heliogabalus]] buried the guests at one of his banquets in an avalanche of rose petals.&lt;ref&gt;''The Classical Tradition'', edited by Anthony Grafton, Glenn W. Most, Salvatore Settis (Harvard University Press, 2010), p. 524.&lt;/ref&gt; In Greek culture, the ''phyllobolia'' was the showering of a victorious athlete or bridal couple with leaves or flower petals.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen G. Miller, ''The Berkeley Plato'' (University of California Press, 2009), p. 43; Bruno Currie, ''Pindar and the Cult of Heroes'' (Oxford University Press, 2005),  p. 141; John H. Oakley and Rebecca H. Sinos, ''The Wedding in Ancient Athens'' (University of Wisconsin Press, 1993), p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:José de Ribera 064.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.2|Venus wearing a crown of roses over the body of Adonis, in the ''Venus and Adonis'' (1637) of [[José de Ribera]]]]
[[Classical mythology]] preserves a number of stories in which blood and flowers are linked in divine metamorphosis.&lt;ref name="Miller-p74"&gt;Miller, ''The Corporeal Imagination,'' p. 74.&lt;/ref&gt; When [[Adonis]], beloved of Aphrodite, was killed by a boar during a hunt, his blood produced a flower. A central myth of the Roman rites of [[Cybele]] is the self-castration of her consort [[Attis]], from whose blood a violet-colored flower sprang. In the [[Gnosticism|Gnostic]] text ''[[On the Origin of the World]]'', possibly dating to the early 4th century,&lt;ref&gt;Hans-Gebhard Bethge, Bentley Layton, Societas Coptica Hierosolymitana, "''On the Origin of the World'' (II,5 and XIII,2)," in ''The Nag Hammadi Library in English: The Definitive New Translation of the Gnostic Scriptures Complete in One Volume'' (Brill, 1977, rev. ed. 1996), p. 170.&lt;/ref&gt; the rose was the first flower to come into being, created from the virgin blood of [[Psyche (mythology)|Psyche]] ("Soul") after she united sexually with Eros.&lt;ref&gt;The examples of Attis, Adonis, ''On the Origin of the World'' from Miller, ''The Corporeal Imagination,'' p. 74.&lt;/ref&gt; In the 4th-century poem ''Cupid Crucified'' by the [[Gallo-Roman culture|Gallo-Roman]] poet [[Ausonius]], the god [[Cupid]] (the Roman equivalent of Eros) is tortured in the underworld by goddesses disappointed in love, and the blood from his wounds causes roses to grow.&lt;ref name="Miller-p75"&gt;Miller, ''The Corporeal Imagination,'' p. 75.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Roses and violets as funerary flowers==
[[File:Fresco Fragment with Four Cupids Hanging Garlands - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|upright=1.4|The making of rose garlands by multiple [[Cupid and Psyche|Cupids and Psyches]], in a wall painting from [[Pompeii]]: the Psyche on the right holds a [[patera|libation bowl]], a symbol of religious piety often depicted as a [[Rosette (design)|rosette]]&lt;ref&gt;Rabun Taylor, "Roman Oscilla: An Assessment," ''RES: Anthropology and Aesthetics'' 48 (2005), p. 92.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Roses had funerary significance in Greece, but were particularly associated with death and entombment among the Romans.&lt;ref&gt;Frederick E. Brenk, ''Clothed in Purple Light: Studies in Vergil and in Latin Literature'' (Franz Steiner, 1999), pp. 87, 102.&lt;/ref&gt; In Greece, roses appear on funerary [[stele]]s, and in epitaphs most often of girls.&lt;ref&gt;Brenk, ''Clothed in Purple Light'' p. 87.&lt;/ref&gt; In Imperial-era Greek epitaphs, the death of an unmarried girl is compared to a budding rose cut down in spring; a young woman buried in her wedding clothes is "like a rose in a garden"; an eight-year-old boy is like the rose that is "the beautiful flower of the [[Erotes (mythology)|Erotes]]" ("Loves" or Cupids).&lt;ref&gt;Brenk, ''Clothed in Purple Light,'' p. 87, note 2.&lt;/ref&gt; As a symbol of both blooming youth and mourning, the rose often marks a death experienced as untimely or premature.&lt;ref name="Brenk-p88"&gt;Brenk, ''Clothed in Purple Light,'' p. 88.&lt;/ref&gt; In the ''[[Iliad]]'', Aphrodite anoints [[Hector]]'s corpse with "[[ambrosia]]l [[oil of roses]]"&lt;ref&gt;As translated by [[Robert Fagles]].&lt;/ref&gt; to maintain the integrity of his body against abuse in death.&lt;ref&gt;''Iliad'' 23.185–187; Cyrino, ''Aphrodite,'' pp. 63, 94. Wooden cult statues might be anointed periodically with rose oil as a preservative, according to [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]] (9.41.7): Barbara Breitenberger, ''Aphrodite and Eros: The Development of Greek Erotic Mythology'' (Routledge, 2007), p. 60.&lt;/ref&gt; In Greek and Latin poetry, roses grow in the blessed afterlife of the [[Elysium|Elysian Fields]].&lt;ref&gt;Brenk, ''Clothed in Purple Light,'' pp. 102–104, 113, citing [[Pindar]], frg. 129 (edition of Snell); [[Propertius]] 4.7.59–62.&lt;/ref&gt;

Bloodless sacrifice to the dead could include rose garlands and violets as well as [[libation]]s of wine,&lt;ref&gt;Hersch, ''The Roman Wedding,'' p. 91, citing Ovid.&lt;/ref&gt; and Latin ''[[purple|purpureus]]'' expressed the red-to-purple color range of roses and violets particularly as flowers of death.&lt;ref name="Brenk-p88" /&gt; In ancient etymology, ''purpureus'' was thought related to Greek ''porphyreos'' in the sense of suffusing the skin with purple blood in bruising or wounding.&lt;ref name="Brenk-p88" /&gt; The [[Augustan literature (ancient Rome)|Augustan]] epic poet [[Vergil]] uses the metaphor of a purple flower to describe the premature, bloody deaths of young men in battle:&lt;ref&gt;Vergil, ''[[Aeneid]]'' 6.884 and 9.434–437; Brenk, ''Clothed in Purple Light,'' pp. 89–90, 112–113.&lt;/ref&gt; the death of [[Pallas (Aeneid)|Pallas]] evokes both the violet of Attis and the [[hyacinth (plant)|hyacinth]] generated from the dying blood of [[Apollo]]'s beloved [[Hyakinthos|Hyacinthus]].&lt;ref&gt;J.D. Reed, ''Virgil's Gaze: Nation and Poetry in the Aeneid'' (Princeton University Press, 2007), p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Claudian]] writes of the "bloody splendor" of roses in the meadow from which Proserpina will be abducted to the underworld, with hyacinths and violets contributing to the lush flora.&lt;ref&gt;Claudian, ''De rapto Proserpina'' 2.92–93: ''sanguineo splendore rosas.''&lt;/ref&gt; Roses and the ominous presence of thorns may intimate bloodshed and mortality even in the discourse of love.&lt;ref&gt;Rosenmeyer, ''The Poetics of Imitation,'' pp. 211–212.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Maenad and Cupid MAN Napoli Inv110591.jpg|thumb|A wreathed [[maenad]] (attendant of Dionysus) holds Cupid as he extends a rose, in a wall painting from the House of [[Lucius Caecilius Iucundus]], Pompeii]]
Conversely, roses in a funerary context can allude to festive banqueting, since Roman families met at burial sites on several occasions throughout the year for libations and a shared meal that celebrated both the cherished memory of the beloved dead and the continuity of life through the family line.&lt;ref&gt;J.M.C. Toynbee, ''Death and Burial in the Roman World'' (Johns Hopkins University Press, 1971, 1996), pp. 62–63; Regina Gee, "From Corpse to Ancestor: The Role of Tombside Dining in the Transformation of the Body in Ancient Rome," in ''The Materiality of Death: Bodies, Burials, Beliefs'', Bar International Series 1768 (Oxford, 2008), pp. 59–68.&lt;/ref&gt; In Roman tomb painting, red roses often spill bountifully onto light ground.&lt;ref name="Brenk-p88" /&gt; These ageless flowers created a perpetual Rosalia and are an expression of Roman beliefs in the soul's continued existence.&lt;ref&gt;Toynbee, ''Death and Burial in the Roman World'', p. 63.&lt;/ref&gt;

The bones or ashes of the deceased may be imagined as generating flowers, as in one Latin epitaph that reads:&lt;blockquote&gt;''Here lies Optatus, a child ennobled by devotion: I pray that his ashes may be violets and roses, and I ask that the [[Terra (mythology)|Earth, who is his mother now]], be light upon him, for the boy's life was a burden to no one.''&lt;ref&gt;Toynbee, ''Death and Burial in the Roman World'', p. 37.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Roses were planted at some tombs and [[mausoleum]]s, and adjacent grounds might be cultivated as gardens to grow roses for adornment or even [[produce]] to sell for cemetery upkeep or administrative costs.&lt;ref&gt;Toynbee, ''Death and Burial in the Roman World'', pp. 97–98; Claire Holleran, ''Shopping in Ancient Rome: The Retail Trade in the Late Republic and the Principate'' (Oxford University Press, 2012), p. 119; John S. Kloppenborg and Richard S. Ascough, ''Greco-Roman Associations: Texts, Translations, and Commentary. I: Attica, Central Greece, Macedonia, Thrace'' (Walter de Gruyter, 2011), vol. 1, p. 327 (in regard to bequests made to associations, who might use surplus profit to benefit the membership).&lt;/ref&gt; In the 19th to the 21st centuries, a profusion of cut and cultivated flowers was still a characteristic of Italian cemeteries to a degree that distinguished them from [[Wikt:Anglo-American|Anglo-American]] practice.&lt;ref&gt;Jack Goody and Cesare Poppi, "Flowers and Bones: Approaches to the Dead in Anglo-American and Italian Cemeteries," in ''Modes of Comparison: Theory and Practice'' (University of Michigan Press, 2006), pp. 420–456; the epitaph of Optatus provides an [[Epigraph (literature)|epigraph]] for the article. See p. 451, note 60, on the possible connection of the Rosalia to the [[Romania]]n festival of [[Rusalii]] at [[Whitsuntide]], with a citation of Gail Kligman, ''Căluş: Symbolic Transformation in Romanian Ritual'' (University of Chicago Press, 1981), and see also Beza, ''Paganism in Romanian Folklore,'' pp. 42–43.&lt;/ref&gt; This difference is one of the [[Roman Catholic]] practices criticized by some [[Protestantism|Protestants]], especially in the 19th century, as too "pagan" in origin.&lt;ref&gt;Goody and Poppi, "Flowers and Bones," p. 442.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rose and violet festivals==
[[File:Statua di silvano forse da italia, II-III sec 01.JPG|thumb|upright=.5|Silvanus, holding pomegranates, grapes, and other produce, attended by hound (2nd-3rd century)]]
Although the rose had a long tradition in funerary art,&lt;ref&gt;Carole E. Newlands, ''Statius. Silvae Book II'' (Cambridge University Press, 2011), p. 94.&lt;/ref&gt; the earliest record of a Roman rose festival named as such dates to the reign of [[Domitian]] (81–96 AD),&lt;ref&gt;''[[Corpus Inscriptionum Latinarum|CIL]]'' 10.444.&lt;/ref&gt; and places the observance on June 20.&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert E.A. Palmer]], "Silvanus, Sylvester, and the Chair of St. Peter," ''Proceedings of the American Philosophical Society'' 122.4 (1978), p. 226.&lt;/ref&gt; The inscription was made by a priestly association ''([[Collegium (ancient Rome)|collegium]])'' in [[Lucania]] devoted to the woodland god [[Silvanus (mythology)|Silvanus]]. It records [[Imperial cult (ancient Rome)|vows for the wellbeing of the emperor]] and prescribes a sacrifice to Silvanus on five occasions in the year, among them the Rosalia. Although Silvanus is typically regarded as a deity of the woods and the wild, Vergil describes him as bearing [[fennel|flowering fennel]] and lilies.&lt;ref&gt;Vergil, ''Eclogue'' 10.25.&lt;/ref&gt; In other inscriptions, three donors to Silvanus had adopted the cultic name ''Anthus'' (Greek ''anthos'', "flower") and a fourth, of less certain reading, may have the Latin name ''Florus'', the masculine form of [[Flora (mythology)|Flora]].&lt;ref&gt;Palmer, "Silvanus, Sylvester, and the Chair of St. Peter," p. 226.&lt;/ref&gt; Since trees are the form of plant life most often emblematic of Silvanus, his connection with flowers is obscure. His female counterparts the [[Silvanae]], primarily found in the [[Danubian provinces]], are sometimes depicted carrying flower pots or wreaths.&lt;ref&gt;Peter F. Dorcey, ''The Cult of Silvanus: A Study in Roman Folk Religion'' (Brill, 1992), p. 44.&lt;/ref&gt; Through his epithet ''Dendrophorus'', "Tree-bearer," he was linked to the Romanized [[#The violets of Attis|cult of Attis and Cybele]] in which celebrants called ''dendrophori'' participated.&lt;ref&gt;Dorcey, ''The Cult of Silvanus,'' pp. 17, 19, 31, 82.&lt;/ref&gt;

When well-to-do people wrote a will and made end-of-life preparations, they might set aside funds for the maintenance of their memory and care ''(cura)'' after death, including rose-adornment. One epitaph records a man's provision for four annual observances in his honor: on the [[Parentalia]], an official festival for honoring the dead February 13; his birthday (''[[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#dies natalis|dies natalis]]''); and a ''Rosaria'' and ''Violaria''.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Inscriptiones Latinae Selectae|ILS]]'' 8366; Regina Gee, "From Corpse to Ancestor: The Role of Tombside Dining in the Transformation of the Body in Ancient Rome," in ''The Materiality of Death: Bodies, Burials, Beliefs,'' Bar International Series 1768 (Oxford, 2008), p. 64.&lt;/ref&gt; Guilds and associations ''(collegia)'' often provided funeral benefits for members, and some were formed specifically for that purpose. Benefactors might fund communal meals and rose-days at which members of the college honored the dead.&lt;ref&gt;John F. Donahue, ''The Roman Community at Table During the Principate'' (University of Michigan Press, 2004), p. 132.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[College of Aesculapius and Hygia]] at Rome celebrated a Violet Day on March 22 and a Rose Day May 11, and these flower festivals are frequent among the occasions observed by dining clubs and burial societies.&lt;ref&gt;Donahue, ''The Roman Community at Table,'' pp. 129–133.&lt;/ref&gt;

Most evidence for the Rosalia comes from [[Cisalpine Gaul]] ([[northern Italy]]), where twenty-four Latin inscriptions referring to it have been found. Ten Latin inscriptions come from the [[Italy (Roman Empire)|Italian peninsula]], three from [[Macedonia (Roman province)|Macedonia]], and four from [[Roman Thrace|Thrace]], [[Illyria]], and [[Pannonia]]. Six Greek inscriptions come from [[Bithynia]], three from Macedonia, and one each from [[Roman Bulgaria|Bulgaria]], [[Scythia]], [[Mysia]], [[Phrygia]], [[Lydia]], [[Asia (Roman province)|Asia]] and [[Arcadia]].&lt;ref&gt;Kokkinia, "Rosen für die Toten," p. 209.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Abraham Brueghel (attr) Blumengabe an Venus.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.3|''Floral Tribute for Venus'' (1690 or earlier), attributed to [[Abraham Brueghel]]]]
At [[Pergamon]], Rosalia seems to have been a three-day festival May 24–26, beginning with an "Augustan day" (''[[dies Augusti]]'', a day of [[Imperial cult (ancient Rome)|Imperial cult]] marking a birthday, marriage, or other anniversary of the emperor or his family).&lt;ref&gt;Steven J. Friesen, ''Imperial Cults and the Apocalypse of John: Reading Revelation in the Ruins'' (Oxford University Press, 2001), p. 129.&lt;/ref&gt; The three-day Rosalia was among the occasions observed by a group of hymnodes, a male choir organized for celebrating Imperial cult, as recorded in a Greek inscription on an early 2nd-century altar. The ''eukosmos'', the officer of "good order" who presided over the group for a year, was to provide one ''[[mina (unit)|mina]]'' (a monetary unit) and one loaf for celebrating the Rosalia on the Augustan day, which was the first day of the month called Panemos on the local calendar.&lt;ref&gt;Friesen, ''Imperial Cults and the Apocalypse of John,'' p. 108. The identification of Panemos with a modern month name varies throughout the ancient calendars on which it appears; see Alan E. Samuel, ''Greek and Roman Chronology: Calendars and Years in Classical Antiquity'' (C.H. Beck, 1972).&lt;/ref&gt; On the second of Panemos, the group's priest provided wine, a table setting, one ''mina'', and three loaves for the Rosalia. The ''grammateus'', a secretary or administrator, was responsible for a ''mina'', a table setting worth one [[denarius]], and one loaf for the third day of Rosalia.&lt;ref&gt;Friesen, ''Imperial Cults and the Apocalypse of John,'' p. 112.&lt;/ref&gt; The group seems to have functioned like a ''collegium'' at Rome, and as a burial society for members.&lt;ref&gt;Friesen, ''Imperial Cults and the Apocalypse of John,'' p. 111.&lt;/ref&gt;

Inscriptions from [[Acmonia]], in [[Phrygia]], show the Rosalia in the context of the [[religious pluralism]] of the Roman Empire. In 95 AD, a bequest was made for a burial society to ensure the annual commemoration of an individual named Titus Praxias. In addition to a graveside communal meal and cash gifts to members, 12 denarii were to be allocated for adorning the tomb with roses. The obligations of membership were both legally and religiously binding: the society had its own [[tutelary deity|tutelary deities]] who were invoked to oversee and ensure the carrying out of the deceased's wishes. These were ''Theos Sebastos'' (= ''[[divus|Divus Augustus]]'' in Latin), [[Zeus]] under the local and unique epithet ''Stodmenos'', [[Asclepius]] the [[Soter|Savior]] (Roman Aesculapius, as in the ''collegium'' above), and [[Artemis of Ephesus]].&lt;ref&gt;Paul Trebilco, ''Jewish Communities in Asia Minor'' (Cambridge University Press, 1991, 1994 reprint), p. 81; Barbara Levick, ''The Government of the Roman Empire: A Sourcebook'' (Routledge, 2000, 2nd ed.), pp. 209–210 (with a date of 85, presumably a typographical error since the date is noted as the eleventh consulship of [[Domitian]]). On ''Stodmenos'', see ''Barrington Atlas of the Greek and Roman World,'' edited by  Richard J. A Talbert (Princeton University Press, 2000), p. 971.&lt;/ref&gt; Acmonia also had a significant [[Hellenistic Judaism|Greek-speaking Jewish community]], and an inscription dating from the period 215–295 records similar arrangements made for a Jewish woman by her husband. It provides for an annual rose-adornment of the tomb by a legally constituted neighborhood or community association, with the solemn injunction "and if they do not deck it with roses each year, they will have to reckon with the justice of God."&lt;ref&gt;Trebilco, ''Jewish Communities in Asia Minor'', pp. 78–81.&lt;/ref&gt; The formula "he will have to reckon with God" was used only among Jews and Christians in Phrygia, and there is a slighter possibility that the inscription might be Christian.&lt;ref&gt;Trebilco, ''Jewish Communities in Asia Minor'', p. 79. The inscription deals with legal titles to property, and unlike Christians at this time, Jews held full rights as Roman citizens to own property.&lt;/ref&gt; The inscription is among the evidence that Judaism was not isolated from the general religious environment of the Imperial world, since a ''rosatio'' could be made without accompanying sacrifices at the tomb. Instead of multiple deities, the Jewish husband honoring his wife invoked the divine justice of his own [[Jewish God|God]], and chose to participate in the customs of the community while adapting them in ways "acceptable to his Jewish faith".&lt;ref&gt;Trebilco, ''Jewish Communities in Asia Minor'', pp. 80–81. Some Jewish wedding practices, including the wearing of rose crowns by the bridegroom or bride, were also compatible with or assimilated from Imperial society in general; Michael L. Satlow, "Slipping toward Sacrament: Jews, Christians, and Marriage," in ''Jewish Culture and Society under the Christian Roman Empire'' (Peeters, 2002), p. 74.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:A Bacchanal (Sebastiano Ricci).jpg|thumb|A cult statue is wreathed with roses in ''A Bacchanal'' by [[Sebastiano Ricci]] (1659–1734)]]
In [[Macedonia (Roman province)|Imperial-era Macedonia]], several inscriptions mention the Rosalia as a commemorative festival funded by bequests to  groups such as a ''vicianus'', a village or neighborhood association (from ''[[vicus]]''); ''[[thiasos]]'', a legally constituted association, often having a religious character; or ''[[symposium]]'', in this sense a drinking and social club. In [[Thessalonica]], a priestess of a ''thiasos'' bequeathed a tract of grapevines to pay for rose wreaths.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Inscriptiones Graecae]]'' X/2 260; Richard S. Ascough, "Paul's 'Apocolypticism' and the Jesus Associations at Thessalonica and Corinth," in ''Redescribing Paul and the Corinthians'' (Society of Biblical Literature, 2011), p. 164.&lt;/ref&gt; If the Dionysian ''thiasos'' disbanded or failed in its duties, the property was to pass to a society of ''Dryophoroi'' ("Oak-Bearers"), or finally to the state.&lt;ref name="Kloppenborg-Ascough-p373"&gt;Kloppenborg and Ascough, ''Greco-Roman Associations,'' p. 373.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to associations of initiates into the [[Dionysian mysteries|mysteries of Dionysus]], inscriptions in Macedonia and [[Thrace]] record bequests for rose-adornment to ''thiasoi'' of [[Diana (mythology)|Diana]] (Artemis) and of the little-attested Thracian god or [[Greek hero cult|hero]] Sourogethes, and to a [[gravedigger]]s' guild.&lt;ref&gt;Kloppenborg and Ascough, ''Greco-Roman Associations,'' p. 325.&lt;/ref&gt; The gravediggers were to kindle a tombside fire each year for the Rosalia, and other contexts suggest that the wreaths themselves might be burnt as offerings.&lt;ref&gt;Kloppenborg and Ascough, ''Greco-Roman Associations,'' pp. 372–374.&lt;/ref&gt; A distinctive collocation that occurs a few times in Macedonian commemoration is an inscription prescribing the Rosalia accompanied by a [[relief]] of the [[Thracian Horseman]].&lt;ref&gt;Kloppenborg and Ascough, ''Greco-Roman Associations,'' pp. 327–329.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some scholars think that customs of the Rosalia were assimilated into Bacchic festivals of the dead by the Roman military, particularly in Macedonia and Thrace.&lt;ref&gt;[[Hendrik Wagenvoort]], "The Journey of the Souls of the Dead to the Isles of the Blessed," ''Mnemosyne'' 24.2 (1971), p. 124; [[Martin P. Nilsson]], "The Bacchic Mysteries of the Roman Age," ''Harvard Theological Review'' 46.4 (1953), p. 187.&lt;/ref&gt; A Greek inscription of 138 AD records a donation for rose-adornment ''(rhodismos)'' to the council in [[Histria (ancient city)|Histria]], in modern [[Dobruja]], an area settled by the Thracian [[Bessi]], who were especially devoted to Dionysus.&lt;ref&gt;Beza, ''Paganism in Romanian Folklore'', p. 43.&lt;/ref&gt; Macedonia was famed for its roses, but nearly all evidence for the Rosalia as such dates to the Roman period.&lt;ref&gt;Kloppenborg and Ascough, ''Greco-Roman Associations,''  pp. 327–329.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bacchic rites===
{{More|Anthesteria}}
Although ivy and grapevines are the regular vegetative attributes of [[Dionysus]], at [[ancient Athens|Athens]] roses and violets could be adornments for [[Dionysia|Dionysian feasts]]. In a fragment from a [[dithyramb]] praising Dionysus, the poet [[Pindar]] (5th century BC) sets a floral scene generated by the opening up of the Seasons ''([[Horae]])'', a time when [[Semele]], the mortal mother of Dionysus, is to be honored:
[[File:John William Waterhouse Ariadne.jpg|thumb|upright=1.4|''Ariadne'' (1898) by the [[pre-Raphaelite]] [[John William Waterhouse]]: the sleeping red-gowned Ariadne is surrounded by roses, with the sailing background implying both the departure of Theseus and the advent of Dionysus, foreshadowed by his leopards&lt;ref&gt;Karl Kilinski II, ''Greek Myth and Western Art: The Presence of the Past'' (Cambridge University Press, 2013), p. 106.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
&lt;blockquote&gt;''... as the chamber of the purple-robed Horai is opened,&lt;br&gt;the nectar-bearing flowers bring in the sweet-smelling spring.&lt;br&gt;Then, then, upon the immortal earth are cast&lt;br&gt;the lovely tresses of violets, and roses fitted to hair&lt;br&gt;and voices of songs echo to the accompaniment of pipes&lt;br&gt;and choruses come to Semele of the circling headband.''&lt;ref&gt;Pindar, frg. 75 SnM, as translated for the [[Loeb Classical Library]] (1997) by William H. Race and cited in this context by Riu, ''Dionysism and Comedy'', p. 108, note 58, and [[Walter Friedrich Otto]], ''Dionysus: Myth and Cult'', translated by Robert B. Palmer (Indiana University Press, 1965, originally published 1960 in German), p. 159.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Dionysus was an equalizing figure of the democratic ''[[polis]]'' whose band of initiates ''(thiasos)'' provided a model for civic organizations.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Seaford, ''Cosmology and the Polis: The Social Construction of Space and Time in the Tragedies of Aeschylus'' (Cambridge University Press, 2012), pp. 101–102.&lt;/ref&gt; A form of Dionysia dating to pre-[[Athenian democracy|democratic Athens]] was the Anthesteria, a festival name some scholars derive from Greek ''anthos'', "flower, blossom",&lt;ref&gt;D. Felton, "The Dead," in ''A Companion to Greek Religion'' (Blackwell, 2010), p. 89; Jennifer Neils, "Children and Greek Religion," in ''Coming of Age in Ancient Greece: Images of Childhood from the Classical Past'' (Yale University Press, 2003), p. 145; [[Carl Kerenyi]], ''Dionysos: Archetypal Image of Indestructable Life'' (Princeton University Press, 1976), p. 300.&lt;/ref&gt; as did the Greeks themselves, connecting it to the blossoming grapevine.&lt;ref&gt;[[Walter Burkert]], ''Homo Necans'' p. 214.&lt;/ref&gt; In the 6th century AD, the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] antiquarian [[Joannes Lydus]] related the festival name to ''Anthousa'', which he said was the Greek equivalent of the Latin ''Flora''.&lt;ref&gt;Lydus, ''De mensibus'' 4.73; [[Clifford Ando]], "The Palladium and the Pentateuch: Towards a Sacred Topography of the Later Roman Empire," ''Phoenix'' 55 (2001), p. 400.&lt;/ref&gt; The three-day festival, which took place at the threshold between winter and spring, involved themes of [[liminality]] and "opening up", but despite its importance in early Athens, many aspects elude certainty. It was primarily a celebration of opening the new wine from the previous fall's vintage.&lt;ref&gt;Noel Robertson, "Athens' Festival of the New Wine," ''Harvard Studies in Classical Philology'' 95 (1993), p. 197ff. Robertson argues that the Anthesteria was not a festival of the dead, and believes those elements have been attributed to it erroneously.&lt;/ref&gt; On the first day, "Dionysus" entered borne by a wheeled "ship" in a public procession, and was taken to the private chamber of the king's wife&lt;ref&gt;The word for "king" is ''[[basileus]]'', an indication that the ceremony evokes a time before Athens was a democracy; Seaford, ''Cosmology and the Polis,'' pp. 87–88.&lt;/ref&gt; for a [[hieros gamos|ritual union]] with her; the precise ceremonies are unknown, but may be related to the myth of [[Ariadne]], who became the consort of Dionysus after she was abandoned by the Athenian [[culture hero]] [[Theseus]].&lt;ref&gt;Seaford, ''Cosmology and the Polis,'' pp. 85–87, 101, 133, citing Apollodorus, ''Against Nature'' 73; Burkert, ''Greek Religion'' pp. 109, 164, 239.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Greek - Red-Figure Chous with Eros - Walters 48206.jpg|thumb|Child's ceremonial wine vessel ''(chous)'' for the Anthesteria, depicting Eros as a chubby boy who pulls a cart and extends his hand toward his own wreathed ''chous'' (ca. 410 BC)]]
In keeping with its theme of new growth and transformation,&lt;ref&gt;Neils, "Children and Greek Religion," in ''Coming of Age in Ancient Greece,'' p. 145.&lt;/ref&gt; the Anthesteria was also the occasion for a [[rite of passage]] from infancy to childhood—a celebratory moment given the high rate of [[infant mortality]] in the ancient world. Children between the age of three and four received a small jug ''(chous)'' specially decorated with scenes of children playing at adult activities. The ''chous'' itself is sometimes depicted on the vessel, adorned with a wreath. The following year, the child was given a ceremonial taste of wine from his ''chous''.&lt;ref&gt;Neils, "Children and Greek Religion," p. 145; John H. Oakley, "Death and the Child," p. 177; Lesley A. Beaumont, "The Changing Face of Childhood," p. 75; and H.A. Shapiro, "Fathers and Sons, Men and Boys," pp. 89, 103, all in ''Coming of Age in Ancient Greece''. See also Burkert, ''Greek Religion'', pp. 237–238.&lt;/ref&gt; These vessels are often found in children's graves, accompanying them to the underworld after a premature death.&lt;ref&gt;Beaumont, "The Changing Face of Childhood," p. 75; Oakley, "Death and the Child," p. 177.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Anthesteria has also been compared with the Roman [[Lemuralia|Lemuria]],&lt;ref&gt;Burkert, ''Homo Necans'', p. 226.&lt;/ref&gt; with the second day a vulnerable time when the barrier between the world of the living and the dead became permeable, and the shades of the dead could wander the earth. On the third day, the ghosts were driven from the city, and Hermes Chthonios ("Underworld [[Hermes]]") received sacrifices in the form of pots of grains and seeds.&lt;ref&gt;Burkert, ''Greek Religion'', pp. 218, 222.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- "Bloody myths" are attached to the festival, especially the killing of the first winemaker [[Ikarios]] by villagers who mistook wine's effect for poison, and the subsequent suicide of his daughter [[Erigone (daughter of Icarius)|Erigone]] by hanging.&lt;ref&gt;Burkert, ''Greek Religion'' pp. 238–239; Seaford, ''Dionysos'', pp. 20–21.&lt;/ref&gt;--&gt; Although the identity of the shades is unclear, typically the restless dead are those who died prematurely.&lt;ref&gt;Kerenyi, ''Dionysos: Archetypal Image of Indestructable Life'', p. 364.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Wine and roses====
The priestess of Thessalonica who bequeathed a tract of vineyard for the maintenance of her memory required each Dionysian initiate who attended to wear a rose wreath.&lt;ref name="Kloppenborg-Ascough-p373" /&gt; In a Dionysian context, wine, roses, and the color red are trappings of violence and funerals as well as amorous pursuits and revelry. Dionysus is described by [[Philostratus]] (d. ca. 250 AD) as wearing a wreath of roses and a red or purple cloak as he encounters Ariadne,&lt;ref&gt;Philostratus, ''Imagines'' 1.15; Terence Cave, ''Retrospectives: Essays in Literature, Poetics and Cultural History'' (Modern Humanities Research Association, 2009), p. 73.&lt;/ref&gt; whose sleep is a kind of death from which she is awakened and transformed by the god's love.&lt;ref&gt;Susan Guettel Cole, "Finding Dionysus," in ''A Companion to Greek Religion'' p. 333; Nina da Vinci Nichols, ''Ariadne's Lives'' (Associated University Presses, 1995), p. 14 ''et passim''; [[Zahra Newby]], "In the Guise of Gods and Heroes: Portrait Heads on Roman Mythological Sarcophagi," in ''Life, Death and Representation: Some New Work on Roman Sarcophagi'' (Walter de Gruyter, 2011), pp. 201–205.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Mosaïque - Buste de Dionysos - Palazzo Massimo.JPG|thumb|left|Bust of Dionysus, wearing a leopardskin and with flowers in his wreath, on a 3rd-century [[Roman mosaic|mosaic]]]]
The [[Crown of Immortality#Crown of stars|crown]] that symbolized Ariadne's immortal union with Dionysus underwent metamorphosis into a [[constellation]], the [[Corona Borealis]]; in some sources, the ''corona'' was a diadem of jewels, but for the Roman dramatist [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]], ''Phaedra'' 769, as noted by Michael Coffey and Roland Mayer, ''Seneca: Phaedra'' (Cambridge University Press, 1990), pp. 159–160; and ''Hercules Furens'' 18, as noted by John G. Fitch, ''Seneca's ''Hercules Furens'': A Critical Text with Introduction and Commentary'' (Cornell University Press, 1987), pp. 125–126.&lt;/ref&gt; and others it was a garland of roses. In the ''Astronomica'' of [[Marcus Manilius|Manilius]] (1st century AD), Ariadne's crown is bejeweled with purple and red flowers—violets, hyacinths, poppies, and "the flower of the blooming rose, made red by blood"—and exerts a positive [[history of astrology|astrological influence]] on cultivating flower gardens, weaving garlands, and distilling perfume.&lt;ref&gt;Manilius, ''Astronomica'' 251–269 (edition of [[A.E. Houseman|Houseman]]), as noted by Michael Murrin, "Renaissance Allegory from Petrarch to Spenser," in ''The Cambridge Companion to Allegory'' (Cambridge University Press, 2010), p. 172, with reference to the influence of the passage on [[Edmund Spenser]], ''Faerie Queene'' 6.10.14.&lt;/ref&gt;

Dionysian scenes were common on [[Roman sarcophagi]], and the persistence of love in the face of death may be embodied by attendant Cupids or Erotes.&lt;ref&gt;Janet Huskinson, ''Roman Children's Sarcophagi: Their Decoration and Its Social Significance'' (Oxford University Press, 1996), p. 30; [[Paul Zanker]] and Björn C. Ewald, ''Living with Myths: The Imagery of Roman Sarcophagi'' (Oxford University Press, 2012), p. 102 ''et passim''; Newby, "In the Guise of Gods and Heroes," pp. 201–205.&lt;/ref&gt; In Vergil's ''[[Aeneid]]'', purple flowers are strewn with the pouring of [[Bacchic mysteries|Bacchic]] [[libation]]s during the funeral rites the hero [[Aeneas]] conducts for his dead father.&lt;ref&gt;Vergil, ''Aeneid'' 5.77–81; Brenk, ''Clothed in Purple Light,'' p. 88.&lt;/ref&gt; In the ''[[Dionysiaca]]'' of [[Nonnus]] (late 4th–early 5th century AD), Dionysus mourns the death of the beautiful youth [[Ampelos]] by covering the body with flowers—roses, lilies, [[anemone]]s—and infusing it with [[ambrosia]]. The dead boy's metamorphosis creates the first grapevine, which in turn produces the transformative substance of wine for human use.&lt;ref&gt;[[Nonnus]], ''Dionysiaca'' 11.241–243; Miguélez-Cavero, ''Poems in Context,'' p. 132.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rites of Adonis===
[[File:Hendrik Goltzius - Stervende Adonis.jpg|thumb|''The blood of the dead Adonis turns into an anemone (Ovid, Met. X 735)'' (1609), by [[Hendrick Goltzius]]]]
The rites of Adonis ''([[Adoneia]])'' also came to be regarded as a Rosalia in the Imperial era.&lt;ref&gt;Dominic Perring, "'Gnosticism' in Fourth-Century Britain: The Frampton Mosaics Reconsidered," ''Britannia'' 34 (2003), p. 108.&lt;/ref&gt; In one version of the myth, blood from Aphrodite's foot, pricked by a thorn, dyes the flowers produced from the body of Adonis when he is killed by the boar.&lt;ref&gt;Rina Talgam, "The ''Ekphrasis Eikonos'' of Procopius of Gaza: The Depiction of Mythological Themes in Palestine and Arabia during the Fifth and Sixth Centuries," in ''Christian Gaza in Late Antiquity'' (Brill, 2004), pp. 223–224.&lt;/ref&gt; In the ''Lament for Adonis'' attributed to [[Bion of Smyrna|Bion]] (2nd century BC), the tears of Aphrodite match the blood shed by Adonis drop by drop,
&lt;blockquote&gt;''and the blood and tears become flowers upon the ground. Of the blood comes the rose, and of the tears the [[Anemone nemorosa|windflower]].''&lt;ref&gt;Brenk, ''Clothed in Purple Light,'' p. 87; translation by J.M. Edmonds at [http://www.theoi.com/Text/Bion.html theoi.com.] [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]] (6.24.7) also connects roses to the story of Aphrodite and Adonis; Cyprino, ''Aphrodite,'' p. 96.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

According to myth, Adonis was born from the incestuous union of [[Myrrha]] and her father. The delusional lust was a punishment from Aphrodite, whom Myrrha had slighted. The girl deceived her father with darkness and a disguise, but when he learned who she really was, his rage transformed her human identity and she became the fragrance-producing [[Commiphora|myrrh tree]]. The vegetative nature of Adonis is expressed in his birth from the tree. In one tradition, Aphrodite took the infant, hid him in a box ''([[larnax]]'', a word often referring to chests for [[cremation|ash]] or other human remains), and gave him to the underworld goddess [[Persephone]] to nurture. When he grew into a beautiful youth, both Aphrodite and Persephone—representing the realms of love and death—claimed him. Zeus decreed that Adonis would spend a third of the year with the [[heavenly Aphrodite]], a third with [[chthonic]] Persephone, and a third on the mortal plane. The theme is similar to Persephone's own year divided between her underworld husband and the world above.&lt;ref&gt;Gina Salapata, "Τριφίλητος Ἄδωνις: An Exceptional Pair of Terra-cotta Arulae from South Italy," in ''Studia Varia from the J. Paul Getty Museum'' (Getty Publications, 2001), vol. 2, p. 34; J.P. Massaut, "Mystique rhénane et humanisme chrétien d'Eckhart à Érasme. Continuité, convergence ou rupture?" in ''The Late Middle Ages and the Dawn of Humanism Outside Italy'' (Leuven University Press, 1972), p. 128, citing as an example Ausonius, ''Epistolarum liber'' 4.49.&lt;/ref&gt;

For [[J.G. Frazer]], Adonis was an archetypal vegetative god, and [[H.J. Rose]] saw in the rites of Adonis "the outlines of an Oriental myth of the [[Great Mother (disambiguation)|Great Mother]] and of her lover who dies as the vegetation dies, but comes back to life again."&lt;ref&gt;[[H.J. Rose]], ''A Handbook to Greek Mythology'' (Routledge, 1928, 6th ed. 1958, 1964 paperback edition), p. 101.&lt;/ref&gt; Robert A. Segal analyzed the death of Adonis as the failure of the "[[Child (archetype)|eternal child]]" ''([[Puer aeternus|puer]])'' to complete his rite of passage into the adult life of the [[polis|city-state]], and thus as a cautionary tale involving the social violations of "incest, murder, license, possessiveness, celibacy, and childlessness".&lt;ref&gt;Robert A. Segal, "Adonis: A Greek Eternal Child," in ''Myth and the Polis'' (Cornell University Press, 1991), pp. 64–85.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:0 Monument funéraire - Adonis mourant - Museu Gregoriano Etrusco.JPG|thumb|left|Dying Adonis attended by hound, on a funerary monument with floral motifs on its corner feet (latter 3rd century BC)]]
Women performed the ''Adoneia'' with ceremonial [[lamentation]] and [[dirge]]s, sometimes in the presence of an effigy of the dead youth that might be [[lectisternium|placed on a couch]], perfumed, and adorned with greenery.&lt;ref name="Salapata-p35"&gt;Salapata, "Τριφίλητος Ἄδωνις," p. 35.&lt;/ref&gt; As part of the festival, they planted "[[gardens of Adonis]]", container-grown [[annual plant|annuals]] from "seeds planted in shallow soil, which sprang up quickly and withered quickly",&lt;ref&gt;Rose, ''A Handbook to Greek Mythology'', p. 101.&lt;/ref&gt; compressing the cycle of life and death.&lt;ref name="Salapata-p35" /&gt; The festival, often nocturnal, was not a part of the official state calendar of holidays, and as a private rite seems like the Rosalia to have had no fixed date.&lt;ref&gt;Salapata, "Τριφίλητος Ἄδωνις," p. 34.&lt;/ref&gt; Although the celebration varied from place to place, it generally had two phases: joyful revelry like a marriage feast in celebration of the love between Aphrodite and Adonis, and ritual mourning for his death. Decorations and ritual trappings for the feast, including the dish gardens, were transformed for the funeral or destroyed as offerings: the garlanded couch became the lying-in [[bier]] ''([[Ancient Greek funeral and burial practices|prothesis]])''.&lt;ref&gt;Salapata, "Τριφίλητος Ἄδωνις," pp. 35–36.&lt;/ref&gt;

The iconography of Aphrodite and Adonis as a couple is often hard to distinguish in Greek art from that of Dionysus and Ariadne.&lt;ref&gt;Salapata, "Τριφίλητος Ἄδωνις," p. 36.&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast to Greek depictions of the couple enjoying the luxury and delight of love, Roman paintings and sarcophagi almost always frame their love at the moment of loss, with the death of Adonis in Aphrodite's arms posing the question of [[resurrection]].&lt;ref&gt;Salapata, "Τριφίλητος Ἄδωνις," pp. 38 and 48 (note 138).&lt;/ref&gt; At [[Madaba]], an Imperial city of the [[Arabia Petraea|Province of Arabia]] in present-day [[Jordan]], a series of mythological mosaics has a scene of Aphrodite and Adonis enthroned, attended by six Erotes and three [[Charites]] ("Graces").&lt;!-- They are approached by a figure labeled ''Agroikis'', a farm girl with a basket holding fruit and a partridge.--&gt; A basket of overturned roses near them has been seen as referring to the Rosalia.&lt;ref&gt;Talgam, "The ''Ekphrasis Eikonos'' of Procopius," p. 223.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[late antiquity]], literary works set at a Rosalia—whether intended for performance at the actual occasion, or only using the occasion as a fictional setting—take the "lament for Adonis" as their theme.&lt;ref&gt;Talgam, "The ''Ekphrasis Eikonos'' of Procopius," p. 223; David Westberg, "The Rite of Spring: Erotic Celebration in the ''Dialexis'' and ''Ethiopoiiai'' of Procopius of Gaza," in ''Plotting With Eros: Essays on the Poetics of Love and the Erotics of Reading'' (Museum Tusculanum Press, 2009), p. 189.&lt;/ref&gt; Shared language for the Roman festival of Rosalia and the floral aspects of the ''Adoneia'' may indicate similar or comparable practices, and not necessarily direct assimilation.&lt;ref&gt;Westberg, "The Rite of Spring," in ''Plotting with Eros,'' p. 189.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The violets of Attis===
[[File:Statue of a reclining Attis at the Shrine of Attis 1.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|Reclining Attis with [[radiate crown]], holding a [[shepherd's crook]] (damaged) in his left hand and in his right pomegranates, pine cones, and wheat: his partial nudity shows that he has undergone complete castration, and the bearded head on which he leans is most likely the river god Sangarius&lt;ref&gt;Maria Grazia Lancellotti, ''Attis, Between Myth and History: King, Priest, and God'' (Brill, 2002), p.116.&lt;/ref&gt; or Gallus&lt;ref&gt;Jaime Alvar, ''Romanising Oriental Gods: Myth, Salvation and Ethics in the Cults of Cybele, Isis and Mithras,'' translated by Richard Gordon (Brill, 2008), p. 38.&lt;/ref&gt; (from [[Ostia Antica|Ostia]], 2nd century AD)]]
From the reign of [[Claudius]] to that of [[Antoninus Pius]], a [[Cybele#'Holy week' in March|"holy week" in March]] developed for ceremonies of the Magna Mater ("Great Mother", also known as ''Mater Deum'', "Mother of the Gods," or [[Cybele]]) and Attis.&lt;ref&gt;Lancellotti, ''Attis'', p. 81; [[Bertrand Lançon]], ''Rome in Late Antiquity'' (Routledge, 2001), p. 91; Philippe Borgeaud, ''Mother of the Gods: From Cybele to the Virgin Mary'', translated by Lysa Hochroth (Johns Hopkins University Press, 2004), pp. 51, 90, 123, 164. Scholars are divided as to whether the full program of observances was put in place under Claudius, or gradually expanded until the time of Antoninus Pius: Gary Forsythe, ''Time in Roman Religion: One Thousand Years of Religious History'' (Routledge, 2012), p. 88; Alvar, ''Romanising Oriental Gods,'' p. 286.&lt;/ref&gt; A preliminary festival on March 15 marked the discovery by shepherds or Cybele of the infant Attis among the reeds of a Phrygian river. The continuous ceremonies recommenced March 22 with the ''Arbor intrat'' ("The Tree enters") and lasted through March 27 or 28. For the day of ''Arbor intrat,'' the college of dendrophores ("tree-bearers") carried a pine tree to which was bound an effigy of Attis, wrapped in "woollen bandages like a corpse" and ornamented with violet wreaths.&lt;ref&gt;[[Francisco Rodríguez Adrados|Francisco R. Adrados]], ''Festival, Comedy and Tragedy: The Greek Origins of Theatre,'' translated by Christopher Holme (Brill, 1975, originally published 1972 in Spanish), p. 395.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lucretius]] (1st century BC) mentions roses and other unnamed flowers in the ecstatic procession of the Magna Mater for the [[Megalensia]] in April.&lt;ref&gt;Lucretius, ''De rerum natura'' 2.627–628.; Hooey, "Rosaliae signorum," p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt;

The most vivid and complex account&lt;ref&gt;Alvar, ''Romanising Oriental Gods,'' p. 65; Gasparao, ''Soteriology,'' p. 41.&lt;/ref&gt; of how the violet was created out of violence in the Attis myth is given by the [[Christian apologist]] [[Arnobius]] (d. ca. 330),&lt;ref&gt;Arnobius of Sicca, ''Adversus Nationes'' 6–7, drawing on sources he identifies as "Timotheus, a man not disreputable in matters of theology," and "Valerius the [[College of Pontiffs|pontifex]]", possibly [[Marcus Valerius Messalla Rufus|Marcus Valerius Messala]], the consul of 53 BC and author of a treatise identifying [[Aion (deity)|Aion]] with [[Janus]] on the etymological basis of ''Ia'', the name "Violet" in the story of Attis. Summary based on that of Lancelotti, ''Attis'', pp. 3–5; Alvar, ''Romanising Oriental Gods,'' pp. 65–67; and Giulia Sfameni Gasparro (combining the versions of Arnobius and Pausanias), ''Soteriology and Mystic Aspects in the Cult of Cybele and Attis'' (Brill, 1985), pp. 38–41.&lt;/ref&gt; whose version best reflects cult practice in the Roman Imperial period.&lt;ref&gt;Alvar, ''Romanising Oriental Gods,'' p. 64.&lt;/ref&gt; The story begins with a rock in Phrygia named ''Agdus'', from which had come the stones transformed to humans by [[Pyrrha]] and [[Deucalion]] to repopulate the world after the [[Ancient Greek flood myths|Flood]]. The Great Mother of the Gods customarily rested there, and there she was assailed by the lustful [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]]. Unable to achieve his aim, the king of gods relieved himself by masturbating on the rock,&lt;ref&gt;Alvar, ''Romanising Oriental Gods,'' p. 65.&lt;/ref&gt; from which was born Acdestis or [[Agdistis]], a violent and supremely powerful [[Sex-androgyny in mythology|hermaphroditic deity]]. After deliberations, the gods assign the ''cura'' of this audacity to [[Liber]], the Roman god [[interpretatio graeca|identified with]] Dionysus: ''cura'' means variously "care, concern, cure, oversight."

Liber sets a snare, replacing the waters of Agdistis's favorite spring ''([[Fontus|fons]])'' with pure wine. Necessity in time drives the thirsty Agdistis to drink, veins sucking up the torpor-inducing liquid. The trap is sprung: a noose, woven from hair, suspends Agdistis by the genitals, and the struggle to break free causes a self-castration. From the blood springs a pomegranate tree, its fruit so enticing that [[Nana (Greek mythology)|Nana]], the daughter of the river god [[Sangarius (mythology)|Sangarius]], ''in sinu reponit'', a euphemism in Imperial-era medical and Christian writing for "placed within the vagina".&lt;ref&gt;J.N. Adams, entry on ''sinus (muliebris)'', ''The Latin Sexual Vocabulary'' (Johns Hopkins University Press, 1982), pp. 90–91. In Pausanias, the impregnating edible is an almond, with the almond tree playing a role later in the version of Arnobius; Gasparro, ''Soteriology,'' p. 38.&lt;/ref&gt; Nana becomes pregnant, enraging her father. He locks her away as damaged goods, and starves her. She is kept alive by fruits and other vegetarian food provided by the Mother of the Gods. When the infant is born, Sangarius orders that it be [[child exposure|exposed]], but it is discovered and reared by a [[goatherd]]. This child is Attis.

[[File:Godward Ionian Dancing Girl 1902.jpg|thumb|upright|left|''[[Ionians|Ionian]] Dancing Girl'' (1902) by [[John William Godward]], a companion to the same violet-wreathed figure in ''[[:Commons:File:With Violets Wreathed 1902.jpg|With Violets Wreathed and Robe of Saffron Hue]],'' an example of classicizing myth in [[Victorian painting]]&lt;ref&gt;Vern G. Swanson, ''John William Godward: The Eclipse of Classicism'' (Antique Collectors Club Limited, 1997), p. 65; Rosemary J. Barrow, ''The Use of Classical Art and Literature by Victorian Painters, 1860-1912: Creating Continuity With the Traditions of High Art'' (Mellen Research University Press, 2007), p. 39.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The exceptionally beautiful Attis grows up favored by the Mother of the Gods and by Agdistis, who is his constant companion. Under the influence of wine, Attis reveals that his accomplishments as a hunter are owing to divine favor—an explanation for why wine is religiously prohibited ''([[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#nefas|nefas]])'' in his sanctuary and considered a pollution for those who would enter. Attis's relationship with Agdistis is characterized as ''[[infamis]]'', disreputable and socially marginalizing. The Phrygian king [[Midas]], wishing to redeem the boy ''(puer)'', arranges a marriage with his daughter, and locks down the city. The ''Mater Deum'', however, know Attis's fate ''(fatum)'': that he will be preserved from harm only if he avoids the bonds of marriage. Both the Mother of the Gods and Agdistis crash the party, and Agdistis spreads frenzy and madness among the convivial guests. In a detail that appears only in a vexed passage in the Christian source,&lt;ref&gt;Gasparro, ''Soteriology,'' pp. 39–40, characterizing the detail as "a [[Christian polemic|polemical]] emphasis".&lt;/ref&gt; the daughter of a concubine to a man named [[Galli|Gallus]] cuts off her breasts. Raging like a [[bacchant]], Attis then throws himself under a pine tree, and cuts off his genitals as an offering to Agdistis. He bleeds to death, and from the flux of blood is born a violet flower.

The Mother of the Gods wraps the genitals "in the garment of the dead" and covers them with earth, an aspect of the myth attested in ritual by inscriptions regarding the sacrificial treatment of animal [[scrotum|scrota]].&lt;ref&gt;Alvar, ''Romanising Oriental Gods,'' p. 275.&lt;/ref&gt; The would-be bride, whose name is Violet (Greek ''Ia)'', covers Attis's chest with woollen bands, and after mourning with Agdistis kills herself. Her dying blood is changed into purple violets. The tears of the Mother of the Gods become an almond tree, which signifies the bitterness of death. She then takes the pine tree to her sacred cave, and Agdistis joins her in mourning, begging Jupiter to restore Attis to life. This he cannot permit; but fate allows the body to never decay, the hair to keep growing, and the [[little finger]] to live and to wave in perpetual motion.

Arnobius explicitly states that the rituals performed in honor of Attis in his day reenact aspects of the myth as he has told it, much of which developed only in the Imperial period, in particular the conflict and intersections with Dionysian cult.&lt;ref&gt;Lancellotti, ''Attis,'' pp. 89–90, 138ff. ''et passim''; Jan N. Bremmer, ''Greek Religion and Culture, the Bible, and the Near East'' (Brill, 2008), pp. 294–296, 298.&lt;/ref&gt; For the ''Arbor intrat'' on March 22, the dendrophores carried the violet-wreathed tree of Attis to the Temple of the Magna Mater. As a ''dies violae'', the day of ''Arbor intrat'' recalled the scattering of violets onto graves for the [[Parentalia]].&lt;ref&gt;Ovid, ''Fasti'' 2.537–540; Lancellotti, ''Attis,'' pp. 90–91; Gasparro, ''Soteriology,'' p. 42. Lancellotti emphasizes the non-cyclical permanence of Attis's death (p. 138) marked by rituals that recall funeral cult.&lt;/ref&gt; The next day the dendrophores laid the tree to rest with noisy music that represented the [[Corybantes]], youths who performed armed dances and in mythology served as guardians for infant gods.&lt;ref&gt;Michele Renee Salzman, ''On Roman Time: The Codex Calendar of 354 and the Rhythms of Urban Life in Late Antiquity'' (University of California Press, 1990), pp. 166–167.&lt;/ref&gt; For the ''Dies Sanguinis'' ("Day of Blood") on March 24, the devotees lacerated themselves in a frenzy of mourning, spattering the effigy with the blood craved as "nourishment" by the dead. Some followers may have castrated themselves on this day, as a preliminary to becoming ''[[galli]]'', the [[eunuch]] priests of Cybele. Attis was placed in his "tomb" for the Sacred Night that followed.&lt;ref&gt;Salzman, ''On Roman Time,'' p. 167; Lancellotti, ''Attis'', pp. 82 and 90.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Sallustius]], the cutting of the tree was accompanied by [[fasting]], "as though we were cutting off the further progress of generation; after this we are fed on milk as though being reborn; that is followed by rejoicings and garlands and as it were a new ascent to the gods."&lt;ref&gt;Sallustius, ''Peri Theōn'' 4.10, as cited by Alvar, ''Romanising Oriental Gods,'' p. 277.&lt;/ref&gt; The garlands and rejoicing ''([[Hilaria]])'' occurred on March 25, the [[vernal equinox]] on the [[Julian calendar]], when Attis was in some sense "reborn" or renewed.&lt;ref&gt;Macrobius, ''Saturnalia'' 1.21.10; Forsythe, ''Time in Roman Religion,'' p. 88.&lt;/ref&gt; Some early Christian sources associate this day with the [[resurrection of Jesus]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Tertullian]], ''Adversus Iudaeos'' 8; [[Lactantius]], ''De Mortibus Persecutorum'' 2.1; Forsythe, ''Time in Roman Religion,'' p. 88; Salzman, ''On Roman Time,'' p. 168.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Damascius]] saw it as a "liberation from [[Hades]]".&lt;ref&gt;Damascius, ''Vita Isidori excerpta a Photio Bibl. (Cod. 242),'' edition of R. Henry (Paris, 1971), p. 131; Salzman, ''On Roman Time,'' p. 168.&lt;/ref&gt; After a day of rest ''(Requietio),'' the ritual cleansing ''(Lavatio)'' of the Magna Mater was carried out on March 27.&lt;ref&gt;Alvar, ''Romanising Oriental Gods,'' pp. 277, 286–287. The ''Lavatio'' is mentioned by Ovid in the Augustan period, and other literary references indicate it was "well established" by the [[Flavian dynasty|Flavian period]]; Forsythe, ''Time in Roman Religion,'' p. 89.&lt;/ref&gt; March 28 may have been a day of initiation into the [[mystery religions|mysteries]] of the Magna Mater and Attis at the [[Vatican Hill|Vaticanum]].&lt;ref&gt;Specifically at the [[Gaianum]], near the Phrygianum sanctuary associated with Cybele; Salzman, ''On Roman Time,'' pp. 165, 167. Lawrence Richardson, ''A New Topographical Dictionary of Ancient Rome'' (Johns Hopkins University Press, 1992), p. 180, suggests that ''Initium Caiani'' might instead refer to the "entry of Gaius" ([[Caligula]]) into Rome on March 28, 37 AD, when he was acclaimed as ''[[princeps]]''. The Gaianum was a track used by Caligula for chariot exercises. Salzman (p. 169) sees the Gaianum as a site alternative to the Phrygianum, access to which would have been obstructed in the 4th century by the construction of [[Old St. Peter's Basilica|St. Peter's]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Although scholars have become less inclined to view Attis within the rigid schema of "dying and rising vegetation god", the vegetal cycle remains integral to the funerary nature of his rites.&lt;ref&gt;Gasparro, ''Soteriology,'' pp. 44–45; H.S. Versnel, ''Inconsistencies in Greek and Roman Religion: Transition and Reversal in Myth and Ritual'' (Brill, 1993, 1994), vol. 2, p. 154.&lt;/ref&gt; The pine tree and pine cones were introduced to the iconography of Attis for their cult significance during the Roman period.&lt;ref&gt;Bremmer, ''Greek Religion and Culture,'' pp. 279 and 288, suggesting also that the tree of the Romans was not entirely an innovation, but a survival or translation of the decorated tree, perhaps an almond, that was part of the [[Hittite religion|Hittite]] new year festival in the spring.&lt;/ref&gt; A late 1st- or 2nd-century statue of Attis from Athens has him with a basket containing pomegranates, pine cones, and a nosegay of violets.&lt;ref&gt;Gasparro, ''Soteriology,'' p. 48.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Vegetal aspects of spring festivals===
Perceived connections with older spring festivals that involved roses helped spread and popularize the Rosalia, and the private ''dies violae'' or ''violaris'' of the Romans was enhanced by the public prominence of ''Arbor intrat'' ceremonies.&lt;ref&gt;Hooey, "Rosaliae signorum," p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt; The conceptual link between Attis and Adonis was developed primarily in the later Imperial period.&lt;ref&gt;Bremmer, ''Greek Religion and Culture,'' p. 270, emphasizing the disparities between the early cult of Attis and developments in [[Late Antiquity]] (p. 268).&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Neoplatonic]] philosopher [[Porphyry (philosopher)|Porphyry]] (d. ca. 305 AD) saw both Adonis and Attis as aspects of the "fruits of the earth":
[[File:The Awakening of Adonis - John William Waterhouse (1899).jpg|thumb|''The Awakening of Adonis'' (1900) by [[John William Waterhouse|Waterhouse]]]]
&lt;blockquote&gt;''Attis is the symbol of the blossoms which appear early in the spring, and fall off before the complete fertilization; whence they further attributed castration to him, from the fruits not having attained to seminal perfection: but Adonis was the symbol of the cutting of the perfect fruits.''&lt;ref&gt;As recorded by the Christian apologist [[Eusebius]], ''[[Praeparatio evangelica]]'' 3.11.12 and 15, and 3.13.14, translated by E.H. Gifford (1903), as cited by Gasparro, ''Soteriology,'' p. 46. In a commentary on Ovid, and citing Porphyry and Eusebius, the 15th-century [[Italian humanist]] [[Paolo Marsi|Paulus Marsus]] noted that "Atys castrated means nothing other than the flower that falls before the fruit"; Rebecca Zorach, ''Blood, Milk, Ink, Gold: Abundance and Excess in the French Renaissance'' (University of Chicago Press, 2005), p. 72.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Porphyry linked Attis, Adonis, Korē (Persephone as "the Maiden", influencing "dry" or grain crops), and Dionysus (who influences soft and [[Nut (fruit)|shell fruits]]) as deities of "seminal law":&lt;blockquote&gt;''For Korē was carried off by [[Pluto (mythology)#Plouton Helios|Pluto]], that is, the sun going down beneath the earth at seed-time; but Dionysus begins to sprout according to the conditions of the power which, while young, is hidden beneath the earth, yet produces fine fruits, and is an ally of the power in the blossom symbolized by Attis, and of the cutting of the ripened corn symbolized by Adonis.''&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Roses and violets are typically among the flower species that populate the meadow from which Persephone was abducted as [[Pluto (mythology)|Pluto]]'s bride.&lt;ref&gt;Cohen, "Mythic Landscapes of Greece," in ''The Cambridge Companion to Greek Mythology'', p. 316, citing the ''[[Homeric Hymn to Demeter]],'' one of the earliest treatments of the myth. Ovid places Proserpina among violets and lilies at ''[[Metamorphoses]]'' 5.332, and dwells on the abundance and variety of flowers—with the rose the favored choice of the attendant [[nymph]]s—in his treatment of the same myth for the month of April at ''Fasti'' 4.429–442. Claudian, ''De raptu Proserpina'' 2.92–93, lists roses, hyacinths and violets.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[comparative mythologist]] [[Mircea Eliade]] saw divine metamorphosis as a "flowing of life" between vegetal and human existence. When violent death interrupts the creative potential of life, it is expressed "in some other form: plant, fruit, flower". Eliade related the violets of Attis and the roses and anemones of Adonis to legends of flowers appearing on battlefields after the deaths of heroes.&lt;ref&gt;[[Mircea Eliade]], ''Patterns in Comparative Religion,'' translated by Rosemary Sheed (University of Nebraska Press, 1996, translation originally published in 1958), p. 302.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Military ''Rosaliae''==

The [[Roman army]] celebrated the ''Rosaliae signorum,'' when the military standards ''(signa)'' were adorned with roses in a [[supplicatio]]n, on two dates in May.  A.H. Hooey viewed the military rose festival as incorporating traditional spring festivals of vegetative deities.&lt;ref&gt;Hooey, "Rosaliae signorum," pp. 27–28.&lt;/ref&gt; The festival is noted in the ''[[Feriale Duranum]]'', a papyrus calendar for a [[Cohort (military unit)|cohort]] stationed at [[Dura-Europos]] during the reign of [[Severus Alexander]] (224–235 AD). The calendar is thought to represent a standard [[Roman calendar|religious calendar]] issued to the military.&lt;ref&gt;Lucinda Dirven, ''The Palmyrenes of Dura-Europos: A Study of Religious Interaction in Roman Syria'' (Brill, 1999), pp. 184–185; Nigel Pollard, ''Soldiers, Cities, and Civilians in Roman Syria'' (University of Michigan Press, 2000), pp. 143 (especially note 126), 146.&lt;/ref&gt; The day of the earlier of the two ''Rosaliae'' is uncertain because of the fragmentary text, but coincided with the period of the [[Lemuralia|Lemuria]], archaic festival days on May 9, 11, and 13&lt;ref&gt;Duncan Fishwick, "Dated Inscriptions and the ''Feriale Duranum''," in ''Syria'' 65 (1988), p. 356; Douglas W. Geyer, ''Fear, Anomaly, and Uncertainty in the Gospel of Mark'' (Scarecrow Press, 2002), p. 138, citing [[Robert O. Fink|R.O. Fink]], A.S. Hooey, and W.S. Snyder, "The ''Feriale Duranum''," ''Yale Classical Studies'' 7 (1940), p. 115. [[Stefan Weinstock]], "A New Greek Calendar and Festivals of the Sun," ''Journal of Roman Studies'' 38 (1948), p. 38, gives the date as May 10. Steven K. Drummond and Lynn H. Nelson, ''The Western Frontiers of the Imperial Rome'' (M.E. Sharpe, 1994), p. 203, place it on May 9.&lt;/ref&gt; for propitiating shades ''([[lemures]]'' or ''larvae)'' of those whose untimely death left them wandering the earth instead of passing into the underworld. The ceremonies of the Lemuria, in the vivid description of [[Ovid]], featured the spitting of black beans as an especially potent [[apotropaic]] gesture.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Lipka, ''Roman Gods: A Conceptual Approach'' (Brill, 2009), p. 43.&lt;/ref&gt; The second of the ''Rosaliae signorum'' occurred on [[May 31]], the day before the [[Iunius (month)#Dates|Kalends of June]].&lt;ref&gt;Phillips, ''Oxford Classical Dictionary,'' quotes the calendar as ''pridie kal. Iunias ob rosalias signorum supplicatio''; that is, as occurring on the day before the [[Kalends]] of June.&lt;/ref&gt; The feast day of June 1, devoted to the tenebrous ''[[Cardea|Dea Carna]]'' ("Flesh Goddess" or "Food Goddess") and commonly called the "[[Bean Kalends]]" ''(Kalendae Fabariae)'',&lt;ref&gt;Macrobius, ''Saturnalia'' 1.12.33.&lt;/ref&gt; may have pertained to rites of the dead&lt;ref&gt;In the conjecture of [[Georg Wissowa|Wissowa]]; [[William Warde Fowler]], ''The Roman Festivals of the Period of the Republic'' (London, 1908), p 131. Fowler is cautious about over-interpreting the evidence to characterize all these occasions as "rites of the dead".&lt;/ref&gt; and like the days of the Lemuria was marked on the calendar as ''[[Fasti#Calendaria|nefastus]]'', a time when normal activities were religiously prohibited. In the later Empire, the ''Rosaliae signorum'' coincided with the third day of the "Bean Games" ''([[Ludi]] Fabarici)'' held May 29–June 1, presumably in honor of Carna.&lt;ref&gt;Salzman, ''On Roman Time,'' pp. 92, 122, 127; Macrobius, ''Saturnalia'' 1.12.33.&lt;/ref&gt; A civilian inscription records a bequest for rose-adornment "on the Carnaria", interpreted by [[Theodor Mommsen|Mommsen]] as Carna's Kalends.&lt;ref&gt;''CIL'' 3.3893; Fowler, ''Roman Festivals'', p. 131.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sculpture from a 3rd-century military headquarters at [[Coria (Corbridge)|Coria]], in Roman Britain ([[Corbridge]], [[Northumberland]]), has been interpreted as representing the ''Rosaliae''.&lt;ref&gt;Fishwick, "Dated Inscriptions and the ''Feriale Duranum''," pp. 351–352.&lt;/ref&gt; A 3rd-century inscription from [[Mogontiacum]] (present-day Mainz), in the province of [[Germania Superior]], records the dedication of an altar to the [[Genius (mythology)|Genius]] of the military unit (a ''[[centuria]]''), on May 10. Although the inscription does not name the ''Rosaliae'', the date of the dedication, made in connection with Imperial cult, may have been chosen to coincide with it.&lt;ref&gt;''CIL'' 13.6681; Fishwick, "Dated Inscriptions and the ''Feriale Duranum''," p. 356.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Rosaliae signorum'' were part of devotional practices characteristic of the army surrounding the military standards. The [[Roman historiography|Imperial historian]] [[Tacitus]] says that the army venerated the standards as if they were gods, and inscriptions record dedications ''([[votum|vota]])'' made on their behalf.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Corpus Inscriptionum Latinarum|CIL]]'' 7.1030 is an example of such a dedication from [[Roman Britain]]: Drummond and Nelson, ''The Western Frontiers of Imperial Rome'', p. 214; G.R. Watson, ''The Roman Soldier'' (Cornell University Press, 1969, 1985), p. 130.&lt;/ref&gt; The day on which a [[Roman legion|legion]] marked the anniversary of its formation was the ''natalis aquilae'', "the Eagle's birthday," in reference to the [[Roman eagle]] of the standard.&lt;ref&gt;Hooey, "Rosaliae signorum," p. 19; [[Pat Southern]], ''The Roman Army: A Social and Institutional History'' (Oxford University Press, 2006), p. 161; Brian Campbell, ''The Roman Army, 31 BC–AD 337: A Sourcebook'' (Routledge, 1994), [https://books.google.com/books?id=RUN-TGktYLYC&amp;pg=PT136&amp;dq=%22rosaliae+signorum%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=1cx1UaWYMKnM2AWys4DABA&amp;ved=0CC8Q6AEwADgK n.p.]&lt;/ref&gt; All Roman [[castrum|military camps]], including [[marching camp]]s, were constructed around a central altar where daily sacrifices were made, surrounded by the standards planted firmly into the ground&lt;ref&gt;Hooey, "Rosaliae signorum," p. 17; Graham Webster, ''The Roman Imperial Army: Of the First and Second Centuries A.D.'' (University of Oklahoma Press, 1979, 3rd ed. 1998), p. 133.&lt;/ref&gt; and by images of emperors and gods.&lt;ref&gt;Allen Brent, ''Cyprian and Roman Carthage'' (Cambridge University Press, 2010), p. 182.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Roman military decorations and punishments|Decorated units]] displayed gold and silver wreaths on their standards that represented the bestowal of living wreaths, and the Eagles and other ''signa'' were garlanded and anointed for [[lustrum|lustrations]], ceremonies for beginning a campaign, victories, crisis rituals, and Imperial holidays.&lt;ref&gt;[[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]], ''Natural History'' 13.3.23; Suetonius, ''Claudius'' 13; Hooey, "Rosaliae signorum," pp. 17–19; Webster, ''The Roman Imperial Army,'' pp. 106 (note 16) and 133.&lt;/ref&gt; Among these occasions was the wedding of the emperor [[Honorius (emperor)|Honorius]] in 398 AD, described in an [[epithalamium]] by [[Claudian]]: the military standards are said to grow red with flowers, and the [[signifer|standard-bearers]] and soldiers ritually shower the imperial bridegroom with flowers ''purpureoque ... nimbo'', in a purple halo.&lt;ref&gt;Hooey, "Rosaliae signorum," pp. 18 and 32, citing [[Claudian]] 10.187–188 and 295–297.&lt;/ref&gt; In recounting a mutiny against [[Claudius]] in 42 AD, [[Suetonius]] avers that divine agency prevented the Eagles from being adorned or pulled from the earth to break camp by the [[Roman legionary|legionaries]] who had violated their oath ''([[sacramentum (oath)|sacramentum]])''; reminded of their religious obligation, they were turned toward repentance ''(in paenitentiam [[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#religio|religione]] conversis)''.&lt;ref&gt;Webster, ''The Roman Imperial Army,'' p. 106, citing Suetonius, ''Claudius'' 13.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Christian apologists]] saw the veneration of the ''signa'' as central to the [[Religion in the Roman military|religious life of the Roman military]], and [[Minucius Felix]] tried to demonstrate that because of the [[cruciform]] shape, the soldiers had been worshipping the [[Christian cross]] without being aware of it.&lt;ref&gt;Hooey, "Rosaliae signorum," p. 16, especially note 3, citing [[Tertullian]] ''[[Apologeticum]]'' 16 and ''Ad nationes'' 1.12, and [[Minucius Felix]] 29.6–7; p. 206&lt;/ref&gt;

Most evidence of the Rosalia from the Empire of the 1st–3rd centuries points toward festivals of the dead. Soldiers commemorated fallen comrades,&lt;ref&gt;Hooey, "Rosaliae signorum," pp. 23–25.&lt;/ref&gt; and might swear an oath on the ''[[manes]]'' (deified spirits) of dead brothers-in-arms.&lt;ref&gt;[[Silius Italicus]], ''Punica'' 6.113–116; Charles W. King, "The Roman ''Manes'': The Dead as Gods," in ''Rethinking Ghosts in World Religions'' (Brill, 2009), p. 112.&lt;/ref&gt; Hooey, however, argued against interpreting the ''Rosaliae signorum'' as a kind of [[Remembrance Day|"poppy day"]]. Roman rose festivals, in his view, were of two distinct and mutually exclusive kinds: the celebratory and licentious festivals of spring, and the somber cult of the dead. Transferred from the civilian realm, the old festivals of vegetative deities were celebrated in the Eastern Empire in a spirit of indulgence and luxury that was uniquely out of keeping with the public and Imperial character of other holidays on the ''Feriale Duranum''.&lt;ref&gt;Hooey, "Rosaliae signorum," pp. 23–26, 32–35. Webster, ''The Roman Imperial Army,'' p. 150, accepts Hooey's "carnival" interpretation.&lt;/ref&gt; This "[[carnival]]" view of the ''Rosaliae signorum'' was rejected by [[William Seston]], who saw the May festivals as celebratory lustrations after the first battles of the military campaigning season, coordinate with the [[Tubilustrium]] that fell on May 23 between the two rose-adornments.&lt;ref&gt;[[William Seston]], "Feldzeichen," in ''Scripta Varia. Mélanges d'histoire romaine, de droit, d'épigraphie et d'histoire du christianisme'' (Publications de l'École française de Rome, 1980), p. 273.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:9595 - Milano - Museo archeologico - Patera di Parabiago - Foto Giovanni Dall'Orto 13 Mar 2012.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|Corybantes accompanying Cybele and Attis (detail from the [[Parabiago plate]]; embossed silver, ca. 200–400 AD, found in a tomb near [[Mediolanum|Milan]], now at the [[Archaeological Museum of Milan]])]]
The Tubilustrium was itself a purification ritual. Attested on calendars for both March 23 and May 23, it was perhaps originally monthly. The lustration ''([[lustrum]])'' was performed regarding the annunciatory trumpets (''tubi'' or ''[[Roman tuba|tubae]]'', a long straight trumpet, and ''[[cornu (horn)|cornua]]'', which curved around the body) that were used to punctuate sacral games and ceremonies, funerals,&lt;ref&gt;[[Jörg Rüpke]], ''The Roman Calendar from Numa to Constantine: Time, History, and the Fasti,'' translated by David M.B. Richardson (Wiley-Blackwell, 2011, originally published in German 1995), pp. 28–29; [[Pat Southern]], ''The Roman Army: A Social and Institutional History'' (Oxford University Press, 2006), p. 159.&lt;/ref&gt; and for signals and timekeeping in the military.&lt;ref&gt;Southern, ''The Roman Army,'' p. 159; [[Yann Le Bohec]], ''The Imperial Roman Army'' (Routledge, 2001, originally published 1989 in French), p. 50; Webster, ''The Roman Imperial Army,'' p. 140.&lt;/ref&gt; The March 23 Tubilustrium coincided in the city of Rome with a procession of [[Mars (mythology)|Mars]]' armed priests the [[Salii]], who clanged their [[ancilia|sacred shields]]. In the later Empire, it had become assimilated into the "holy week" of Attis, occurring on the day when the tree rested at the Temple of the Magna Mater. As a pivotal point in the cycle of death/chaos and (re)birth/order, the day brought together noise rituals of wind and percussion instruments from different traditions, the clamor of the [[Corybantes]] or ''Kouretes'' who attended Cybele and Attis, and Roman ceremonies of apotropaic trumpet blasts or the beating of shields by the Salian priests,&lt;ref&gt;Salzman, ''On Roman Time,'', pp. 166–167. Alvar, ''Romanising Oriental Gods,'' p. 73, cites [[Julian (emperor)|Julian]], ''Oratio'' 5.169c, on the sounding of trumpets after the castration of Attis.&lt;/ref&gt; who were theologically identified with the ''Kouretes'' as early as the 1st century BC.&lt;ref&gt;The Salii identified with the ''Kouretes'' by [[Dionysius of Halicarnassus]] 2.70–71 (see also [[Catullus]] 63, who attributes the ''tripudium'' dance of the Salii to the ecstatic followers of Cybele and Attis); Bremmer, ''Greek Religion and Culture,'' p. 296.&lt;/ref&gt;

Tacitus records the performance of noise rituals on the trumpets by the military in conjunction with a [[lunar eclipse]].&lt;ref&gt;Tacitus, ''Annales'' 1.28; Southern, ''The Roman Army,'' p. 159; Rüpke, ''The Roman Calendar,'' p. 28, especially note 44.&lt;/ref&gt; The practice is found in other sources in a civilian context.&lt;ref&gt;Rüpke, ''The Roman Calendar,'' p. 28, citing [[Juvenal]] 6.442–443 and [[Livy]] 26.5.9.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jörg Rüpke]] conjectures that the ''tubae'' were played monthly "to fortify the [[waning moon]] ([[Luna (mythology)|Luna]])", one [[nundinal cycle]] after the [[full moon]] of the [[Ides (calendar)|Ides]], since the Roman calendar was originally [[lunar calendar|lunar]].&lt;ref&gt;Rüpke, ''The Roman Calendar,'' p. 28. Rüpke argues that the Tubilustrium continued to be monthly, with the likely exception of [[Februarius|February]]—a month already largely consumed with the care of the dead—but in other months its spot on calendars was overwritten by festivals that doubled up on the date.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''signa'' and the trumpets were closely related in Roman military culture, both ceremonially and functionally, and on [[Trajan's Column]] the trumpets are shown pointing toward the standards during lustrations.&lt;ref&gt;Webster, ''The Roman Imperial Army,'' p. 134.&lt;/ref&gt; Although Latin ''lustratio'' is usually translated as "purification", lustral ceremonies should perhaps be regarded as realignments and restorations of good order: "lustration is another word for maintaining, creating or restoring boundary lines between the centric order and the ex-centric disorder".&lt;ref&gt;Versnel, ''Inconsistencies in Greek and Roman Religion,'' pp. 311–312, 321; Jörg Rüpke, ''Domi Militiae: Die Religiöse Konstruktion des Krieges in Rom'' (Franz Steiner, 1990), pp. 144–146.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Rosaliae'' of the standards in May were contingent on ''[[supplicatio]]nes'', a broad category of propitiatory ritual that realigned the community, in this case the army, with the ''[[pax deorum]]'', the "treaty" or peace of the gods, by means of a procession, public prayers, and offerings. The military calendar represented by the ''Feriale Duranum'' prescribed ''supplicationes'' also for March 19–23, the period that began with the [[Quinquatria]], an ancient festival of [[Minerva]] and Mars, and concluded with a Tubilustrium. The [[Crisis of the Third Century]] prompted a revival and expansion of the archaic practice of ''supplicatio'' in connection with military and Imperial cult.&lt;ref&gt;Brent, ''Cyprian and Roman Carthage,'' pp. 144, 149, 172–174, 182–183, 188, 191–197, 218–219, 227, 244, 248 (describing the principles of imperial ''supplicationes'' in regard to the universal ''supplicatio'' of [[Decius]] and the ''pax deorum'').&lt;/ref&gt;

==On the calendar==
[[File:Chronography of 354 Mensis Maius.png|thumb|Illustration of the month of May based on the [[Calendar of Filocalus]] (354 AD), which places the Rosalia on May 23&lt;ref&gt;Salzman, ''On Roman Time,'' p. 112.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

In the later Empire, rose festivals became part of the iconography for the month of May. The date would vary locally to accommodate the blooming season.&lt;ref&gt;Salzman, ''On Roman Time'' p. 98.&lt;/ref&gt; For month allegories in [[Roman mosaic|mosaics]], May is often represented with floral wreaths, the [[Fillet (clothing)|fillets]] or ribbons worn for sacrifice, and wine [[amphora]]e.&lt;ref name="Salzman-p97"&gt;Salzman, ''On Roman Time'' p. 97.&lt;/ref&gt; May (Latin ''[[Maius]]'') began in the middle of the ''[[Ludi Florae]]'', a series of games in honor of the goddess [[Flora (mythology)|Flora]] that opened April 28 of the [[Julian calendar]] and concluded May 3. Flora was a goddess of flowers and blooming, and her festivities were enjoyed with a notable degree of sexual liberty. In the 2nd century AD, Philostratus connects rose garlands with Flora's festival.&lt;ref&gt;Hooey, "Rosaliae signorum," p. 27, citing Philostratus, ''Epigram'' 55.&lt;/ref&gt; A Greek epigram from the ''[[Palatine Anthology]]'' has May personified announce "I am the mother of roses".&lt;ref&gt;''Anthologia Palatina'' 9.580.4, as cited by Hooey, "Rosaliae signorum," p. 27: εἰμὶ ῥόδων γενέτης ''(eimi rhodōn genetēs)''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Among explanations for the month's name was that it derived from ''[[Maia (mythology)#Roman Maia|Maia]]'', a goddess of growth or increase whose own name was sometimes said to come from the adjective ''maius'', "greater". Maia was honored in May with her son [[Mercury (mythology)|Mercury]] (Greek Hermes), a god of boundaries and commerce, and a [[psychopomp|conductor of souls]] to the afterlife. The theological identity of Maia was capacious; she was variously identified with goddesses such as ''[[Terra (mythology)|Terra Mater]]'' ("Mother Earth"), the Good Goddess ''([[Bona Dea]])'', the Great Mother Goddess ''([[List of Roman deities#Magna Mater|Magna Mater]]'', a title also for Cybele), [[Ops]] ("Abundance, Resources"), and Carna, the goddess of the Bean Kalends on June 1.&lt;ref&gt;H.H.J. Brouwer, ''Bona Dea: The Sources and a Description of the Cult'' (Brill, 1989), pp. 232, 354; [[Macrobius]], ''Saturnalia'' 1.12.16–33. These identifications probably reflect the influence of Varro, who tended to see a great number of goddesses as ultimately representing Terra.&lt;/ref&gt; Roses were distributed to the [[Arval Brothers]], an archaic priesthood of Rome, after their banquets for the May festival of [[Dea Dia]].&lt;ref&gt;Hooey, "Rosaliae signorum," p. 27, note 57, citing the ''Acta Fratrum Arvalium''.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:The Soul of the Rose - Waterhouse.jpg|thumb|upright=.5|''The Soul of the Rose'' (1908), Psyche in the garden of Cupid by [[John William Waterhouse|Waterhouse]]]]
Although the month opened with the revelry of Flora, in mid-May the Romans observed the three-day Lemuria for propitiating the wandering dead.&lt;ref&gt;[[H.H. Scullard]], ''Festivals and Ceremonies of the Roman Republic'' (Cornell University Press, 1981), pp. 110–111, 115–116.&lt;/ref&gt; The season of roses thus coincided with traditional Roman festivals pertaining to blooming and dying. The demand for flowers and perfumes for festal and funerary purposes made [[floriculture]] an important economic activity, especially for the rich estates of [[Africa (Roman province)|Roman Africa]].&lt;ref&gt;Salzman, ''On Roman Time,'' pp. 97–99; Holleran, ''Shopping in Ancient Rome,'' pp. 58, 119, 208–210.&lt;/ref&gt; One Roman tomb painting shows vendors displaying floral garlands for sale.&lt;ref&gt;Holleran, ''Shopping in Ancient Rome,'' p. 210.&lt;/ref&gt; Following the Lemuria, Mercury and Maia received a joint sacrifice during a merchants' festival on the Ides of May (the 15th). The [[Calendar of Filocalus]] (354 AD) notes a flower fair on May 23, when the roses come to market ''([[macella|macellus]])''.&lt;ref&gt;''Macellus rosas sumat'': Phillips, ''Oxford Classical Dictionary,'' p. 1335.&lt;/ref&gt; The month is illustrated for this calendar with a king of roses: a young man, wearing the long-sleeved robe called a ''[[dalmatica]]'', carries a basket of roses on his left arm while holding a single flower in his right hand to smell.&lt;ref name="Salzman-p97" /&gt; In other pictorial calendars, the Rose King or related imagery of the rose festival often substitutes for or replaces the traditional emblem of Mercury and his rites to represent May.&lt;ref&gt;Salzman, ''On Roman Time,'' pp. 97–99.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Ovid's ''[[Fasti (poem)|Fasti]]'', a poem about the Roman calendar, Flora as the divine representative of May speaks of her role in generating flowers from the blood of the dead: "through me glory springs from their wound".&lt;ref&gt;Ovid, ''Fasti'' 5.228 ''(de quorum per me volnere surgit honor)''&lt;!--sic--&gt;; Carole E. Newlands, ''Playing with Time: Ovid and the Fasti'' (Cornell University Press, 1995), p. 110; Hersch, ''The Roman Wedding,'' p. 91.&lt;/ref&gt; Ovid shows how her mythology weaves together themes of "violence, sexuality, pleasure, marriage, and agriculture."&lt;ref&gt;Hersch, ''The Roman Wedding,'' p. 91.&lt;/ref&gt; The Romans considered May an unpropitious month for weddings, a postponement that contributed to the popularity of June as a bridal month. Each day of the Lemuria in mid-May was a ''[[dies religiosus]]'', when it was religiously prohibited to begin any new undertaking, specifically including marriage "for the sake of begetting children".&lt;ref&gt;Hersch, ''The Roman Wedding,'' pp. 46–47 and 90, citing [[Macrobius]], ''Saturnalia'' 1.16.18, noting that the Lemuria and the procession of the [[Argei]], which even the Romans themselves regarded as obscure and dauntingly archaic, endowed the entire month with an uneasy feeling.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 4th century, the Rosalia was marked on the official calendar as a public holiday [[Roman Empire#Spectacles and recreation|at the amphitheater]] with games ''([[ludi]])'' and theatrical performances. A calendar from [[Capua]] dating to 387 AD notes a ''Rosaria'' at the amphitheater on May 13.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Feriale Capuanum]]'' (387 AD): ''III id. mai(as) Rosaria Amphitheatri''; Salzman, ''On Roman Time'' p. 98.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 6th century, a "Day of Roses" was held at [[Gaza City#Ancient period|Gaza]], in the [[Eastern Roman Empire]], as a spring festival that may have been a Christianized continuation of the Rosalia.&lt;ref&gt;Nicole Belayche, "Pagan Festivals in Fourth-Century Gaza," p. 17, citing [[Choricius of Gaza|Chorichius]], and Talgam, "The ''Ekphrasis Eikonos'' of Procopius," pp. 223–224, both in ''Christian Gaza in Late Antiquity''.&lt;/ref&gt; [[John of Gaza]] wrote two [[anacreontic]] poems that he says he presented publicly on "the day of the roses", and [[declamation]]s by the Christian rhetorician [[Procopius of Gaza|Procopius]]&lt;ref&gt;Not the historian.&lt;/ref&gt; and poetry by [[Choricius of Gaza]] are also set at rose-days.&lt;ref&gt;Westberg, "The Rite of Spring," in ''Plotting with Eros,'' p. 189: ἐν τῇ ἡμέρᾳ τῶν ῥόδων; Talgam, "The ''Ekphrasis Eikonos'' of Procopius," p. 223.&lt;/ref&gt;

Roses were in general part of the imagery of [[Early Christian art|Early Christian funerary art]],&lt;ref&gt;Robin M. Jensen, "Christian Art," in ''The Oxford Encyclopedia of Ancient Greece and Rome'' (Oxford University Press, 2010), p. 93.&lt;/ref&gt; as was ivy.&lt;ref&gt;Gillian MacKie, "Symbolism and Purpose in an Early Christian Martyr Chapel: The Case of San Vittore in Ciel d'Oro, Milan," ''Gesta'' 34.2 (1995), pp. 93–94.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Christian martyr|Martyrs]] were often  depicted or described with flower imagery, or in ways that identified them with flowers.&lt;ref name="Miller-p75" /&gt; [[Paulinus of Nola]] (d. 431) reinterpreted traditions associated with the Rosalia in Christian terms for his natal poem ''(natalicium)'' about [[Felix of Nola|Saint Felix of Nola]], set January 14:&lt;ref&gt;Patricia Cox Miller, "'The Little Blue Flower Is Red': Relics and the Poeticizing of the Body," ''Journal of Early Christian Studies'' 8.2 (2000), p. 228.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
''Sprinkle the ground with flowers, adorn the doorways with garlands. Let winter breathe forth the purple beauty ''(purpureum)'' of spring; let the year be in flower before its time, and let nature submit to the holy day. For you also, earth, owe wreaths to the martyr’s tomb. But the holy glory of the doorway to the heavens encircles him, flowering with the twin wreaths of war and peace.''&lt;ref&gt;[[Paulinus of Nola]], ''Carmen'' 14.110–116 = ''[[Corpus Scriptorum Ecclesiasticorum Latinorum|CSEL]]'' 30:50, as cited by Miller.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

At one of the earliest extant [[martyrium (architecture)|martyr shrines]], now part of the [[Basilica of Sant'Ambrogio]] in Milan, a mosaic portrait dating perhaps as early as 397–402 depicts [[Victor Maurus|Saint Victor]] within a classically inspired wreath of lilies and roses, wheat stalks, grapes on the vine, and olive branches: the circular shape represents eternity, and the vegetation the four seasons.&lt;ref&gt;MacKie, "Symbolism and Purpose in an Early Christian Martyr Chapel," pp. 93–95.&lt;/ref&gt; In the Christian imagination, the blood-death-flower pattern is often transferred from the young men of Classical myth—primarily Adonis and Attis—to female virgin martyrs.&lt;ref&gt;Miller, ''The Corporeal Imagination,'' p. 205.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Eulalia of Mérida]] is described by [[Prudentius]] (d. ca. 413) as a "tender flower" whose death makes her "a flower in the Church's garland of martyrs": the flow of her purple blood produces purple violets and blood-red crocuses ''(purpureas violas sanguineosque crocos)'', which will adorn her [[relic]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Miller, ''The Corporeal Imagination,'' pp. 75–76, quoting Jill Ross.&lt;/ref&gt; The rose can also symbolize the blood shed with the loss of virginity in the sacrament of marriage.&lt;ref&gt;John D. Miller, ''Beads and Prayers: The Rosary in History and Devotion'' (Burns &amp; Oats, 2002), pp. 166–167.&lt;/ref&gt;

Drawing on the custom of floral crowns as awards in the Classical world, [[Cyprian]] (d. 258) described heavenly crowns of flowers for the faithful in the afterlife: lilies for those who did good works, and an additional crown of roses for martyrs.&lt;ref&gt;Ronald Lightbown, ''Carlo Crivelli'' (Yale University Press, 2004), p. 268.&lt;/ref&gt; In one early [[Passion (Christianity)|passion]] narrative, a martyr wears a rose crown ''(corona rosea)'' at a heavenly banquet.&lt;ref&gt;Miller, ''The Corporeal Imagination,'' p. 75, citing the ''Passio Mariani et Iacobi.''&lt;/ref&gt;  For [[Ambrose]] (d. 397), lilies were for virgins, violets for [[Confessor of the Faith|confessors of the faith]], and roses for martyrs;&lt;ref&gt;Ambrose, ''Expositio in Lucam'' 7.128 (=''PL'' 15, col. 1821), as noted by Clare Stancliffe, "Red, White and Blue Martyrdom," in ''Ireland in Early Mediaeval Europe. Studies in memory of Kathleen Hughes'' (Cambridge University Press, 1982), p. 32; Lightbown, ''Carlo Crivelli'', p. 268.&lt;/ref&gt; of these, the imagery of the violet has no biblical precedent.&lt;ref&gt;Lightbown, ''Carlo Crivelli'', p. 269.&lt;/ref&gt; In a passage influenced by Vergilian imagery, Ambrose enjoins young women who are virgins to "Let the rose of modesty and the lily of the spirit flourish in your gardens, and let banks of violets drink from the spring that is watered by the sacred blood."&lt;ref&gt;Ambrose, ''On Virgins'' 4.17; Boniface Ramsey, ''Ambrose'' (Routledge, 1997), pp. 110 and 223, note 40.&lt;/ref&gt; In the description of [[Jerome]] (d. 420), "a crown of roses and violets" is woven from the blood of [[Saint Paula]]'s martyrdom.&lt;ref&gt;''Epistle to [[Eustochium]]'' 108.31 = ''[[CSEL]]'' 55, p. 349, as cited by Stancliffe, "Red, White and Blue Martyrdom," pp. 30–31.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Dante]] later entwines Classical and Christian strands of imagery in his ''[[Paradiso (Dante)|Paradiso]]'', linking the garland of saints with the rose ''corona'' of Ariadne, whom he imagines as translated to the heavens by it.&lt;ref&gt;Dante, ''Paradiso'' 13.13–15, as noted by Robert Hollander and Jean Hollander, ''Dante: Paradiso'' (Anchor Books, 2007), p. 353.&lt;/ref&gt; The use of the term "[[rosary]]" (Latin ''[[History of the rosary|rosarium]]'', a crown or garland of roses) for [[Marian devotions|Marian]] [[prayer beads]] was objected to by some Christians, including [[Alanus de Rupe]], because it evoked the "profane" rose wreath of the Romans.&lt;ref&gt;Anne Winston-Allen, ''Stories of the Rose: The Making of the Rosary in the Middle Ages'' (Pennsylvania State University Press, 1997), pp. 81–82. Alanus, who played a key role in the [[history of the rosary|development of the rosary]], preferred the term "[[psalter]]".&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Miracle of the roses|Miracles involving roses]] are ascribed to some female saints, while roses are a distinguishing attribute of others ranging from [[Cecilia of Rome]] (d. 230 AD) to [[Thérèse of Lisieux]] (d. 1897).&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Wilson, "Cults of Saints in the Churches of Central Paris," in ''Saints and Their Cults: Studies in Religious Sociology, Folklore, and History'' (Cambridge University Press, 1983), p. 242.&lt;/ref&gt; The floral iconography of Saint Cecilia includes a rose or floral wreath, a [[palm branch (symbol)|palm branch]], and a "tall sprig of almond leaves and flowers in her hand".&lt;ref&gt;''A Glossary of Ecclesiastical Terms,'' edited by Orby Shipley (London, Oxford and Cambridge, 1872), pp. 99–100.&lt;/ref&gt; Roses are among the most characteristic attributes of [[Mary, mother of Jesus]], who became associated with the month of May,&lt;ref&gt;Richard Griffiths, ''Pen and the Cross: Catholicism and English Literature 1850–2000'' (Continuum, 2010), p. 39.&lt;/ref&gt; replacing goddesses such as Maia and Flora in the popular imagination.&lt;ref&gt;Charlene Spretnak, ''Missing Mary: The Queen of Heaven and Her Re-emergence in the Modern Church'' (Palgrave Macmillan, 2004), pp. 222–223; Lorraine Kochanske Stock, "Lords of the Wildwood: The Wild Man, the Green Man, and Robin Hood," in ''Robin Hood in Popular Culture: Violence, transgression, and justice'' (D.S. Brewer, 2000), pp. 242, 245–247; J. Miller, ''Beads and Prayers'', pp. 166–167.&lt;/ref&gt; Mary is described in early Christian literature as a ''rosa pudoris'', "rose of modesty",&lt;ref&gt;Ambrose, ''De virginibus'' 3, noted by  Winston-Allen, ''Stories of the Rose,'' p. 88.&lt;/ref&gt; and a rose among thorns.&lt;ref&gt;[[Coelius Sedulius|Sedulius]], ''Paschale carmen'', as cited by Winston-Allen, ''Stories of the Rose,'' p. 88.&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Middle Ages]], roses, lilies and violets become the special flowers of Mary.&lt;ref&gt;Lightbown, ''Carlo Crivelli,'' p. 268.&lt;/ref&gt; In some Catholic cultures, offerings of flowers are still made to Mary, notably in [[Roman Catholicism in Mexico|Mexican devotional practices]] for [[Our Lady of Guadalupe]].&lt;ref&gt;Timothy Matovina, ''Latino Catholicism: Transformation in America's Largest Church'' (Princeton University Press, 2012), p. 175.&lt;/ref&gt; On the island of [[Pollap]], in [[Micronesia]], offerings of flowers before the cult statue of Mary are added to ceremonies of the rosary especially for May; the concept of the rosary as a "crown of roses" complements local traditions of wearing a flower wreath on the head.&lt;ref&gt;Juliana Flinn, ''Mary, the Devil, and Taro: Catholicism and Women's Work in a Micronesian Society'' (University of Hawaii Press, 2010), pp. 147–148, 151.&lt;/ref&gt; Latin hymns and litanies from the earliest Christian era name Mary as the "Mystical Rose" and by an array of rose epithets, or as a garden that bore [[Christ]] in the image of the rose.&lt;ref&gt;Winston-Allen, ''Stories of the Rose,'' pp. 88–89 ''et passim;'' J. Miller, ''Beads and Prayers,'' p. 166.&lt;/ref&gt; Ambrose declared that the blood of Christ in the [[Eucharist]], [[transubstantiated]] from wine, was to be perceived as a rose.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ambrose of Milan]], on ''Psalm'' 118: ''Cernis Rosam, hoc est dominici corporis sanguineum'', as quoted by R.T. Hampson, ''Medii Aevi Kalendarium, or Dates, Charters, and Customs of the Middle Ages'' (London,1841), vol. 1, p. 87.&lt;/ref&gt; The five-petaled rose became a symbol of the [[Five Wounds of Christ]] and hence of the [[Resurrection of Jesus|Resurrection]].&lt;ref&gt;J. Miller, ''Beads and Prayers,'' p. 166.&lt;/ref&gt;

The living bodies and corpses of saints were said to exude a floral "odor of sanctity" as one of the most notable signs of their holiness.&lt;ref&gt;Constance Classen, ''The Color of Angels: Cosmology, Gender and the Aesthetic Imagination'' (Routledge, 1998), pp. 36–37.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pope Gregory I]] described the fragrance and luminosity of the rose as issuing from the blood of martyrs.&lt;ref&gt;Lightbown, ''Carlo Crivelli,'' p. 269.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Herman of Steinfeld]] exhaled a fragrance "like a garden full of roses, lilies, violets, poppies and all kinds of fragrant flowers" as he prayed.&lt;ref&gt;Classen, ''The Color of Angels,'' p. 37.&lt;/ref&gt; The bedridden virgin [[Lydwine of Schiedam]] was said to consume nothing but spiced wine, and wept "fragrant tears of blood" which she called her roses; when these dried on her cheeks overnight, they were gathered and kept in a box. The omen of her death was the opening of roses on a mystical rosebush, and when she was buried the bag of rose blood-tears was used as her pillow.&lt;ref&gt;Classen, ''The Color of Angels'', pp. 38–39.&lt;/ref&gt; Flowers, blood, and relics were interwoven in the imagery of Christian literature from the earliest period.&lt;ref&gt;Miller, ''The Corporeal Imagination,'' p. 73.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rose Sundays===

Two days of the [[liturgical calendar]] have been called "Rose Sundays". The fourth Sunday of [[Lent]] is also known as ''Dominica de rosa'' ("Rose Sunday"), when [[Liturgical colours|rose-colored]] [[vestments]] may replace the purple or violet [[penance|penitential]] vestments of the season. On this day the [[Pope]] blesses the [[Golden Rose]], a [[Jewellery|jewel]] in the shape of a rose.&lt;ref&gt;P.M.J. Rock, "Golden Rose," in ''The Catholic Encyclopedia'' (1909), vol. 6, p. 629; Matthew Bunson, ''Our Sunday Visitor's Encyclopedia of Catholic History'' (Our Sunday Visitor, 1995, 2004), p. 403.&lt;/ref&gt; Benedict, a [[Canon (priest)|canon]] of [[St. Peter's Basilica]] in the mid-12th century, recorded a ceremony on this day when the Pope carried a moss-wrapped rose in the [[Stations of the Cross]].&lt;ref&gt;The station on this fourth Sunday of Lent was at S. Croce in Ierusalemme, and the route took the Pope back to the [[Lateran Palace]], where he presented the rose to the city prefect; [[H.E.J. Cowdrey]], ''Pope Gregory VII, 1073–1085'' (Oxford University Press, 1998), p. 14, citing Benedict, cap. 36, p. 150.&lt;/ref&gt; A 19th-century ecclesiastical [[lexicographer]] saw the Golden Rose as having functions analogous to the [[The Golden Bough (mythology)|Golden Bough]], with Mary assuming attributes of Persephone.&lt;ref&gt;Hampson, ''Medii Aevi Kalendarium,'' pp. 342–343.&lt;/ref&gt;

In medieval texts, [[Pentecost]] is sometimes called ''Rosalia'' or ''Rosata Pascha''.&lt;ref&gt;Hampson, ''Medii Aevi Kalendarium,'' p. 341.&lt;/ref&gt; The traditional [[Romanian language|Romanian]] name for Pentecost is ''Rusalii'', thought to derive from ''Rosalia''.&lt;ref&gt;Theodore A. Koehler,"The Christian Symbolism of the Rose", ''Roses and the Arts: A Cultural and Horticultural Engagement'', Central State University, Wilberforce, Ohio, May 8, 1986.[http://campus.udayton.edu/mary/rosarymarkings36.html]&lt;/ref&gt; In [[medieval Rome]], a ''Dominica de Rosis'' (Sunday of Roses) or ''Pascha rosarum'' or ''rosatum'' was celebrated for the [[Octave (liturgical)|octave]] of the [[Feast of the Ascension]], the Sunday before [[Pentecost]]. The Pope delivered a sermon about the [[Holy Spirit]] on this day at the [[Santa Maria Rotunda]], the [[basilica]] converted from the [[Pantheon, Rome|ancient Pantheon]]. Rose petals were showered through the [[oculus]] in the dome to represent the descent of the tongues of flame.&lt;ref&gt;Cowdrey, ''Pope Gregory VII,'' p. 14, citing Benedict, cap. 61, p. 157; Cristina Mazzoni, ''Saint Hysteria: Neurosis, Mysticism, and Gender in European Culture'' (Cornell University Press, 1996), p. 144; F.G. Holweck, entry on "Paschal Tide," ''The Catholic Encyclopedia'' (New York, 1911), vol. 11, p. 517; Hampson, ''Medii Aevi Kalendarium,'' pp. v and 86–87, also citing the ''Liber Pollicitus'' (n. 59, also found as ''Liber Politicus'') of Benedict. See also Johann Herolt, ''Sermo'' xxvi, ''Sermones Discipuli in Quadragesima'' (Venice, 1599), p. 84; Francesco Antonio Zaccaria, ''Onomasticum Rituale selectum'' (1787), p. 122; ''Sanctissimi domini nostri Benedicti Papae XIV Bullarium'' (1827), vol. 12, p. 133; Adriano Cappelli, ''Cronologia, cronografia e calendario perpetuo'' (Hoepli, 1998), p. 142.&lt;/ref&gt; After dinner, a ''[[carnival|ludus Carnelevaris]]'' was celebrated with drinking among the knights and soldiers, followed by performances which featured the killing of animals that symbolized various sins.&lt;ref&gt;This included "the killing of a bear to symbolize the devil who tempted the flesh, of bullocks to symbolize their pride, and of a cockerel to symbolize their lusts; thus, they might live chastely and soberly, and keep a good [[Easter]]": Cowdrey, ''Pope Gregory VII,'' p. 14, citing Benedict, cap. 7(5), p. 172.&lt;/ref&gt; The custom of scattering roses for Pentecost spread, and continued to the modern era, as reflected in feast names such as the ''Pasqua di rose'' or ''Pâques rosées''.&lt;ref&gt;Mazzoni, ''Saint Hysteria,'' p. 144.&lt;/ref&gt; Churches might be built with a "[[:Commons:Category:Holy Ghost hole|Holy Ghost hole]]" in the ceiling for the release of rose petals or white doves.&lt;ref&gt;Gertrud Muller Nelson, ''To Dance With God: Family Ritual and Community Celebration'' (Paulist Press, 1986), p. 27; Diana L.

Forlong, ''Encyclopedia of Religions'' (1906, reprint 2008), vol. 3, p. 205; C.A. White, "The Pope's Golden Rose," ''Notes and Queries'' 3 (1893), p. 343.&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''signing ceremony''' is a [[ceremony]] in which a [[Bill (proposed law)|bill]] passed by a [[legislature]] is [[Signature|signed]] (approved) by an [[Executive (government)|executive]], thus becoming a [[law]].
==History==
Modern-day signing ceremonies are derived from ceremonies that occurred when the [[British monarchy|British monarch]] gave [[Royal Assent]] to [[Act of Parliament|acts of Parliament]]. Signing ceremonies are an aspect of [[Politics of the United States|American politics]].

Signing ceremonies may be performed by [[Governor|state governors]] upon signing an act of the [[State legislature (United States)|state legislature]] into law or may be performed by the [[President of the United States]] upon signing an [[act of Congress]] into law. The President often invites leaders from the [[United States Congress|Congress]] that were instrumental in the passage of the bill as well as interested members of the community. One practice is to use several [[pen]]s and honor individuals by giving them the pens used in the signing ceremony. For the signing of the 1964 [[Civil Rights Act of 1964|Civil Rights Act]], President [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] used more than 75 pens. The pens were then given to attending dignitaries and supporters of the bill, including [[Rosa Parks]], Attorney General [[Robert F. Kennedy]], [[Hubert Humphrey]], [[Everett McKinley Dirksen]] and [[Martin Luther King Jr.]]

Signing ceremonies are associated with acts that are viewed as legislative triumphs for the executive. Conversely, laws that are passed reluctantly or are controversial are often signed into law quietly and privately without any public ceremony.

'''''Sister Jiang''''' ({{zh|c=江姐|p=Jiāng Jiě}}) is a 1964 [[Chinese-language western-style opera]] based on the real life death of [[Sichuan]] revolutionary martyr [[Jiang Zhuyun]], though in the opera the name is changed to Jiang Xueqin.&lt;ref name=east&gt;East Asian History - Institute of Advanced Studies, Australian National University, 1998 p134-137&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Chongqing &amp; The Three Gorges'' Kim Hunter Gordon, Jesse Watson Page 97  "... including the child Xiao Luobo tou, were executed by gunshot.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6460">A '''stand-up meeting''' (or simply "stand-up") is a meeting in which attendees typically participate while standing. The discomfort of standing for long periods is intended to keep the meetings short. 

== Notable examples ==

By tradition, the [[Privy Council of the United Kingdom]] meets standing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Privy Council Office FAQs|url=http://privycouncil.independent.gov.uk/work-of-the-privy-council-office/faqs/|publisher= Privy Council Office|accessdate=17 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Software development ==
[[File:Daily sprint meeting.jpg|thumb|A stand-up in the computing room]]
Some software development methodologies envision daily [[team]]-[[meeting]]s to make commitments to team members. The daily commitments allow participants to know about potential challenges as well as to coordinate efforts to resolve difficult and/or time-consuming issues.

&lt;/ref&gt; The stand-up meeting is sometimes also referred to as the "stand-up", "morning rollcall" or "daily [[scrum (development)|scrum]]".

The meeting should take place at the same time and place every working day. All team members are encouraged to attend, but the meetings are not postponed if some of the team members are not present. One of the crucial features is that the meeting is a communication opportunity among team members and not a status update to management or stakeholders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Stray |first=Viktoria |last2=Sjøberg |first2=Dag |last3=Dybå |first3=Tore |date=2016-01-11 |title=The daily stand-up meeting: A grounded theory study |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0164121216000066 |journal=Journal of Systems and Software |volume=114 |issue=20 |pages=101–124 |doi=10.1016/j.jss.2016.01.004 |pmid= |access-date=2016-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although it is sometimes referred to as a type of status meeting, the structure of the meeting is meant to promote follow-up conversation, as well as to identify issues before they become too problematic. The practice also promotes closer working relationships in its frequency, need for follow-up conversations and short structure, which in turn result in a higher rate of knowledge transfer – a much more active intention than the typical status meeting.  Team members take turns speaking, sometimes passing along a token to indicate the current person allowed to speak.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Each member talks about progress since the last stand-up, the anticipated work until the next stand-up and any impediments, taking the opportunity to ask for help or collaborate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.mountaingoatsoftware.com/scrum/daily-scrum|title=Daily Scrum Meetings |publisher= Mountain Goat Software}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Team members may sometimes ask for short clarifications and make brief statements, such as "Let's talk about this more after the meeting", but the stand-up does not usually consist of full-fledged discussions.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}

== Three Questions ==

[[Scrum (software development)|Scrum]]-style stand-ups convene daily to re-plan in-progress development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scrumguides.org/|title=Scrum Guide|publisher= scrum.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though it may not be practical to limit all discussion to these three questions, the objective is to create a new sprint plan within the time box (less than 15 minutes), while deferring discussions about impediments until after the event is complete. Team members briefly (a maximum of one minute per team member) address three questions as input to this planning:

# What did I do yesterday that helped the development team meet the sprint goal?
# What will I do today to help the development team meet the sprint goal?
# Do I see any impediment that prevents me or the development team from meeting the sprint goal?

Whereas [[Kanban (development)|Kanban]]-style daily stand-ups focus more on:

# What obstacles are impeding my progress?
# (looking at the board from right to left) What has progressed?

'''''Sungods in Exile''''' is a book by David Gamon that was published in 1978 under the pseudonym David Agamon, allegedly from the notes of a Dr [[Karyl Robin-Evans]] who was said to be a professor at [[Oxford University]].

The book tells of a 1947 expedition to [[Tibet]] in which the scientist visited the [[Bayan Har Mountains]]. Robin-Evans claimed that the Dropa tribe was of [[extraterrestrial life|extraterrestrial]] origin and had crashed on Earth. The book featured photographs of the tribe and the alleged [[Dropa stones]] which contained messages from the extraterrestrials.

Although researchers were unable to locate Dr Karyl Robin-Evans, the Dropa stones appeared regularly in the UFO subculture and author [[Hartwig Hausdorf]] popularized the story in his 1998 book ''[[The Chinese Roswell]]''. Later variations of the story added a fictional Professor Tsum Um Nui of the equally fictional Beijing Academy for Ancient Studies who decoded the language of the stones.

In 1995, British author David Gamon admitted in ''[[Fortean Times]]'' that he had written ''Sungods in Exile'' as a hoax under the Agamon pseudonym,&lt;ref&gt;''Fortean Times'' 75 (Jun/Jul 1994), page 57&lt;/ref&gt; inspired by the popularity of [[Erich von Däniken]] and his books on [[ancient astronauts]]. The source material for the story was taken from a 1960s magazine article in ''Russian Digest'', and a 1973 French science fiction novel ''Les disques de Biem-Kara'', (''The discs of Biem-Kara''), by Daniel Piret.

{{For|the [[association football]] competitions|Super cup}}
The '''Supercup''' was a [[West Germany|West German]] [[auto racing]] series created by the [[ADAC]] in 1986 as a replacement for the [[Deutsche Rennsport Meisterschaft]] (DRM).  The series used [[Group C]] category [[sports prototype]]s identical to the ones used in the [[World Sportscar Championship]], yet running nearly exclusively within West Germany.  The series lasted for four years before it was cancelled following the 1989 championship.&lt;ref name="WSPR"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://wspr-racing.com/wspr/results/supercup/nf_supercup_home.html | title = Supercup | publisher = World Sports Prototype Racing | accessdate = 2008-02-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The series was initially sponsored by [[sport auto (Germany)|sport auto]] magazine during its inaugural season,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.racingsportscars.com/photo/Nurburgring-1986-04-27-photo.html | title = Supercup Nürburgring 1986 | publisher = Racing Sports Cars | date = 25 April 2006 | accessdate = 2008-02-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; then replaced by [[Würth]] the following two years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.racingsportscars.com/photo/Nurburgring-1987-04-26-photo.html | title = Supercup Nürburgring 1987 | publisher = Racing Sports Cars | date = 16 May 2004 | accessdate = 2008-02-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.racingsportscars.com/photo/Norisring-1988-06-26-photo.html | title = Supercup Norisring 1988 | publisher = Racing Sports Cars | date = 22 November 2004 | accessdate = 2008-02-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Television network [[Sat.1]] sponsor the championship's final year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.racingsportscars.com/photo/Norisring-1989-06-25-photo.html | title = Supercup Norisring 1989 | publisher = Racing Sports Cars | date = 22 November 2004 | accessdate = 2008-02-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Format==
The Supercup would employ a sprint format for all of its races, each race lasting approximately one hour although later events were extended to near an hour and a half.  These short distances meant that unlike the [[endurance racing (motorsport)|endurance]] races seen in the World Championship, Supercup teams would not be required to change drivers during the course of an event.  Each season consisted of five rounds, all held in West Germany with the exception of a [[Silverstone Circuit|Silverstone]] round in 1989.  Popular circuits included the [[Nürburgring]], [[Hockenheimring]], [[Diepholz]] airfield, and the [[Norisring 200 Miles]] event.

The cars ran rules nearly identical to the [[FIA]]'s [[Group C]] category, broken into C1 and C2 classes.  The larger C1 class was dominated by both factory and customer [[Porsche 956]]s and [[Porsche 962|962Cs]], as well as efforts from the [[Jaguar Cars|Jaguar]], [[Mercedes-Benz]], and [[Nissan Motors|Nissan]] factory teams.  C2 consisted of teams running engines limited in capacity to produce less power than the C1 cars but also weighed less.  Although two classes ran, only a single championship was held.

==Champions==
Championships for both drivers and teams were held over the four seasons.  [[Joest Racing]] won three championships, with the factory [[Porsche]] team winning during their sole year of competition.  [[Hans-Joachim Stuck]] won the drivers championship the first two years for Joest then Porsche.  [[Jean-Louis Schlesser]] managed to nab the drivers championship in 1988 for [[Sauber]]-[[Mercedes-Benz|Mercedes]] although Joest retained the teams title.  [[Bob Wollek]] returned the drivers championship to the team in 1989, to go along with their third team title.

==Demise==
The championship was cancelled following the 1989 season as manufacturers and teams chose to concentrate solely on the World Championship rather than risking equipment and drivers for a national series.  [[Porsche]] withdrew immediately after their 1987 championship, while Sauber left the series after failing to win the teams championship in 1988.  Although fields of twenty cars were still seen in the final year, there was a lack of interest in a 1990 season, the series was folded.&lt;ref name="WSPR" /&gt;

The aim of the festival is to promote unaccompanied [[Traditional Irish singing|traditional singing]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.clarelibrary.ie/eolas/cominfo/arts/whatson/2002/13th_singing_festival.htm 13th Clare Festival of Traditional Singing], www.clarelibrary.ie&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=  Vallely|first= Fintan|date= |title= The Companion to Irish Traditional Music|url= |location= 2011Cork |publisher= Cork University Press|page= 136-137|isbn= 978-1859184509|author-link= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In 1989 Anthony Edwards, librarian of the Ennistymon branch of the [[Clare County Library]], and Maureen Rynne, joined hands to organise a festival to promote traditional singing. Later [[Tom Munnelly]] joined in at the organizing committee. The first festival took place in June 1990 and was opened by then [[President of Ireland]] [[Patrick Hillery]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.clarelibrary.ie/eolas/library/branches/etlibhist.htm Brief History of Ennistymon Public Library], www.clarelibrary.ie&lt;/ref&gt;

The first years (1990–2002) it was held in [[Ennistymon]]. Due to the ill health of Munnelly the festival was moved to Spanish Point, but after two editions there (2003 and 2004) it ceased to exist.&lt;ref name=y2010&gt;[http://www.oac.ie/site/content/clare-festival-traditional-singing-2010 The Clare Festival of Traditional Singing 2010], www.oac.ie&lt;/ref&gt; After the death of Tom Munnelly in 2007, interest raised again and a new series started in 2010. It is now also a commemoration of mr. Munnelly.&lt;ref name=y2010/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://jerryoreilly.net/events/clare_festival.html Jerry O'Reilly], jerryoreilly.net&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Logo du Tournoi des 9 provinces.png|alt=Logo of tournament of the 9 provinces|thumb|Logo of tournament of the 9 provinces]]

'''The tournament of the 9 provinces of Gabon''' '''(T9P)''' is a festival of traditional African dances and songs that takes place during the month of August in [[Libreville]] in [[Gabon]]. Although the event takes place in Gabon, the initial objective of this event is to present the traditional cultural richness of the different ethnic groups of the peoples of [[Central Africa]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://originvl.com/2016/09/03/tournoi-des-9provinces/|title=Le tournoi des 9 provinces : une initiative de Espoir Gabon|date=2016-09-03|access-date=2017-10-02|language=fr-FR}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Historical ==
The origin of the creation of the tournament of the nine provinces dates back to 2015. This independent initiative was born thanks to Yoan Mboussou, Doctor and president of the socio-cultural association Espoir Gabon, who had this idea after discovering the "abandoned remains" of the [[Centre International des Civilisations Bantu|Bantu International Center of Civilizations (CICIBA)]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Espoir Gabon|title=Résumé du TOURNOI DES 9 PROVINCES - ESPOIR GABON - CULTURE 7 MAG|date=2016-09-21|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5R1Hma2Fg5g|accessdate=2017-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; a project that never really came into being when it was supposed to promote [[Bantu peoples|Bantu]] culture around the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.lexpress.fr/actualites/1/culture/le-centre-international-des-civilisations-bantoues-un-mirage-africain_1572622.html|title=Le Centre international des civilisations bantoues, un mirage africain|date=2014-09-03|work=LExpress.fr|access-date=2017-10-02|language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt; There was also, according to the members of the association Gabon, a desire to revive the festival of cultures Gabon which had disappeared in recent years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.gaboneco.com/evenement-la-fete-de-la-culture-ressuscitee.html|title=Evénement : La Fête de la Culture, ressuscitée ! - Gaboneco|work=Gaboneco|access-date=2017-10-02|language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.gabonmediatime.com/le-ministere-de-la-culture-relance-gabon-neuf-provinces/|title=Le ministère de la Culture relance " Gabon neuf provinces "|date=2017-07-18|work=Gabon Media Time|access-date=2017-10-02|language=fr-FR}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first edition of this festival took place in August 2016 in Libreville, one week before the [[Gabonese presidential election, 2016|Gabonese presidential election of 2016]] which was going to plunge the country into a deep political crisis. There was a desire to strengthen social cohesion, which was beginning to show signs of tension in the face of the presidential scrutiny approach.

The 2016 tournament of the nine provinces took place during the week of 13 to 20 August 2016, in Libreville, Gabon. Open to the public, its realization within the ruins of the CICIBA was done with the cooperation of the squatters association of CICIBA.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Espoir Gabon|title=CICIBA - TOURNOI DES 9 PROVINCES 2016|date=2017-02-08|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--Lo5YOSRgk|accessdate=2017-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; The final of this first edition saw the participation of two countries: Gabon and Chad.

{{Automation}}
A '''trade fair''' ('''trade show''', '''trade exhibition''', or '''expo''') is an exhibition organized so that companies in a specific [[industry]] can showcase and demonstrate their latest products and services, meet with industry partners and customers, study activities of rivals, and examine recent [[market trend]]s and [[market opportunity|opportunities]].  In contrast to consumer fairs, only some trade fairs are open to the public, while others can only be attended by company representatives (members of the trade, e.g. [[professional]]s) and members of the [[Mass media|press]], therefore trade shows are classified as either "public" or "trade only". A few fairs are hybrids of the two; one example is the [[Frankfurt Book Fair]], which is trade only for its first three days and open to the general public on its final two days. They are held on a continuing basis in virtually all markets and normally attract companies from around the globe. For example, in the U.S., there are currently over 10,000&lt;ref&gt;CIC Economic Significance Study Executive Summary p.5 http://www.conventionindustry.org/ResearchInfo/EconomicSignificanceStudy/ESSExecSummary.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; trade shows held every year, and several online directories have been established to help organizers, attendees, and marketers identify appropriate events.

==History==
Modern trade fairs follow in the tradition of trade fairs established in late medieval Europe, in the era of [[merchant capitalism]].  In this era, produce and craft producers visited towns for trading fairs, to sell and showcase products. From the late eighteenth century, industrial exhibitions in Europe and North America became more common reflecting the technological dynamism of the [[Industrial Revolution]].

In the late 19th century, the concept of annual industry-wide trade shows gained traction, spreading from European manufacturing centers to North America. By the 20th century, specialized companies came into existence simply to manage the trade-show industry, and permanent trade show grounds or convention centers were established as venues that featured a rotating calendar of trade shows.

In the 21st century, with the rapid industrialization of [[Asia]], trade shows and exhibitions are now commonplace throughout the Asian continent, with China dominating the exhibitions industry in Asia, accounting for more than 55 per cent of all space sold in the region in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Conventions and exhibitions: Asia-Pacific rising|url=http://www.ttgmice.com/magazine/?term_id&amp;issues&amp;ID=33315|publisher=TTGmice|accessdate=1 April 2013|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140302021653/http://www.ttgmice.com/magazine/?term_id&amp;issues&amp;ID=33315|archivedate=2 March 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Use==
Trade fairs play important roles in [[marketing]] as well as [[business networking]] in market sectors that use them. People will seek to meet people and companies at their own level in the [[supply chain]], as well as potential suppliers and potential buyers.&lt;ref name=Entrep&gt;{{cite news |last1=Applegate |first1=Jane |title=How to Work a Trade Show |url=https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/44420 |work=Entrepreneur |date=17 September 2001 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Generally there will be a central trade show floor with booths where people exhibit their goods or services, and throughout the day there will be seminars for continuing education on matters relevant to the industry, like best practices, trends, and regulation. There will also be some shared meals with keynote speakers, and social events in the evenings.&lt;ref name=Entrep/&gt;  Booths range from simple tables to elaborate constructions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Morgan |first1=Brittney |title=Trade Show Displays: A Buyer's Guide |url=https://www.businessnewsdaily.com/7124-trade-show-displays.html |work=Business News Daily |date=September 15, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Trade fairs often involve a considerable investment in time and money by participating companies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Training |first1=Employment, Small Business and |title=Benefits and risks of trade shows and exhibitions |url=https://www.business.qld.gov.au/running-business/marketing-sales/marketing-promotion/show-exhibition/benefits |publisher=The State of Queensland: Business Queensland |accessdate=8 June 2018 |language=en-AU}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The planning includes arranging meetings with other attendees beforehand and resources to follow up on opportunities that are created at the fair.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Tabbitt |first1=Sue |title=Making the most of an international trade fair |url=https://www.theguardian.com/small-business-network/2016/feb/05/international-trade-fair-exporting-overseas-business |work=The Guardian |date=5 February 2016 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Costs include space rental, booth design and construction of trade show displays, telecommunications, travel, accommodations, and promotional literature and items to give to attendees.&lt;ref name=Entrep/&gt; 

In addition, costs are incurred at the show for services such as electrical, booth cleaning, internet services, and drayage (also known as material handling). This local spending on logistics leads cities to promote trade shows as a means of local economic development, as well as providing opportunities for local businesses to grow, and attract new businesses to come.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Bathelt |first1=Harald |last2=Golfetto |first2=Francesca |last3=Rinallo |first3=Diego |title=Trade Shows in the Globalizing Knowledge Economy |date=2014 |publisher=OUP Oxford |isbn=9780191019036 |page=86ff |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QNP1AwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA86 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Unto These Hills''''' is an outdoor historical drama during summers at the 2,800-seat Mountainside Theatre in [[Cherokee, North Carolina|Cherokee]] in western [[North Carolina]]. It is the third-oldest outdoor historical drama in the [[United States]], after ''[[Lost Colony (play)|The Lost Colony]]'' in [[Manteo, North Carolina|Manteo]] in eastern North Carolina, and ''[[The Ramona Pageant]]'' in Southern California.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}} The first version of the play was written by [[Kermit Hunter]] and opened on July 1, 1950, to wide acclaim.

The play recounts the history of the Cherokee of the Eastern region up to their [[Indian Removal|removal]] by United States forces in 1838 via the [[Trail of Tears]] to [[Indian Territory]], now [[Oklahoma]]. The drama includes notable Cherokee historic figures, including [[Sequoyah]], [[Junaluska]], Chief [[Yonaguska]] or Drowning Bear, and [[William Holland Thomas]] (the adopted son of Drowning Bear and the only white chief of the Cherokee), Selu the Corn Mother, and Kanati the Great Hunter.

== History ==
The [[Western North Carolina Associated Communities]] (WNCAC) in western North Carolina wanted to develop tourism and promote economic growth in the western part of the state. Inspired by the success of Paul Green's historic outdoor drama, or political pageant, [[The Lost Colony]], the WNCAC decided to make another political pageant about the [[Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians]] (ECBI) in Cherokee North Carolina. When Paul Green was unavailable to write a second play, they commissioned UNC grad student [[Kermit Hunter]] to write the new outdoor drama. With the help of Joe Jennings, director Samuel Selden chose the breathtaking backdrop for the drama in the EBC's homeland of [[Cherokee, North Carolina]]. The Mountainside Theatre theater was then built for this outdoor drama. The play was first produced on July 1, 1950. It was immediately successful with more than 100,000 audience members in its first year of production.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}} 

The play has run for more than 60 years at the Mountainside Theatre, which is owned and operated by the EBCI.&lt;ref name=Kiss&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.citizen-times.com/article/20100709/ENT/307090017/1037|title= Head to these hills: Cherokee outdoor drama still stuns after more than 50 years|last=Kiss|first=Tony|work=[[Asheville Citizen-Times]]|date=July 9, 2010|accessdate=July 9, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is staged Monday through Saturday evenings.  

Famous alumni of ''Unto These Hills'' include [[Michael Rosenbaum]], best known for his portrayal of [[Lex Luthor]] on ''[[Smallville (TV series)|Smallville]]''; [[Adam Richman]], host of [[Travel Channel]]'s ''[[Man v. Food]]''; [[Polly Holliday]], of the 1970s sitcom ''[[Alice (TV series)|Alice]]''; and actor and former [[U.S. Representative]] [[Ben L. Jones]] of [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], a regular on [[CBS]]'s ''[[The Dukes of Hazzard]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.goupstate.com/article/20080710/NEWS/807100327/1097/entertainment&amp;title=_Unto_These_Hills__wowing_another_generation 'Unto These Hills' wowing another generation], 10 July 2008, Press release: Go Upstate&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, the EBCI Tribal Government hired playwright [[Hanay Geiogamah]] ([[Kiowa]]) to revise the script, the first complete rewrite since the play was instituted.  Geiogamah is a writer/director/producer of Native American dramas, as well as the founder of the [[American Indian Dance Theatre]] and Professor in the Department of Theater at the [[University of California, Los Angeles]]. Geiogamah was chosen to address a number of issues with the previous script, including historical inaccuracies. He was also encouraged to increase Cherokee tribal participation in the cast. Geiogamah accepted this challenge, wrote a new script, and produced a show. But, many tribal members were reportedly not fond of the new play version, saying that it removed the Cherokee style of story telling and their history in this area.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}} Geiogamah had added more interpretive dance to help convey the story. In addition, many tribal members missed having the story of [[Tsali]] included in the play.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}} He is believed to have sacrificed his life in battle to gain approval for the remainder of his Cherokee people to stay in their homeland of North Carolina, at a time of conflict with European Americans.

In 2007, the tribe hired Pat Allee and Ben Hurst to write a new script.  In 2008, additional changes were made by Linda West.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cherokee-nc.com/index.php?page=12 Cast of Unto These Hills, Drama by Cherokee NC&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Fewer than 50,000 people saw the performance in summer 2009, about half the number from years ago. John Tissue, director of the Cherokee Historical Association, suggests [[Late-2000s recession|economic problems]] as the reason for the reduced crowds. The 2010 production is credited to Linda Squirrel. Eddie Swimmer, a Cherokee, serves as director of the drama.&lt;ref name=Kiss/&gt;  As of 2010, more than six million people have seen the production.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}

'''''While Europe Slept: How Radical Islam is Destroying the West from Within''''' is a 2006 book by [[Bruce Bawer]]. It was Bawer's second book dealing with the issue of religious fundamentalism, following his earlier ''Stealing Jesus: How Fundamentalism Betrays Christianity'', a critique of fundamentalist Christianity published in 1998.

''While Europe Slept'' argues that Europe's democratic traditions and open society face a growing demographic and cultural threat from Europe's [[Islam|Muslim]] immigrant communities, who according to Bawer reject [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] values and resist integration. Bawer blames this trend primarily on an alleged "self-destructive passivity" among Europeans, whom he regards as "appeasing" essentially incompatible philosophies like [[radical Islam]] in the name of religious tolerance.&lt;ref name="NYT"/&gt; Bawer compares this approach unfavorably with what he sees as a more robust American tradition which proudly asserts its values and expects immigrants to adopt them.

The book received mixed reviews, with some strongly supporting its arguments while others rejected or even ridiculed them. Some felt the book raised important questions but failed to adequately make its case.

The book received a 2006 nomination in the "Criticism" category from the [[National Book Critics Circle]], a choice which was met with condemnation from two former members of the organization.

==Book summary==

''While Europe Slept'' advances two central arguments: firstly, that Europe faces a growing cultural and demographic threat from its Muslim immigrant population; and secondly, that Europe's political and intellectual leadership is exacerbating the threat by failing to encourage immigrants to fully integrate into the wider society.&lt;ref name=Boer/&gt; Bawer's argument is summarized by one of the book's reviewers thus:

&lt;blockquote&gt;European governments subscribe to the worst kind of political correctness, Bawer writes. From Norway to Italy, governments shower immigrants with benefits, yet corral them into ghettos, prevent them from becoming real citizens and turn a blind eye to Muslim attacks on women, Jews and gays, he says.
&lt;p&gt;
Bawer hints at a coming cataclysm. "Immigrants to Europe bring with them many tribal customs that are flagrantly inconsistent with a Western understanding of human rights", he writes. "These customs represent flashpoints of latent or potential conflict between the Muslim immigrant communities and their host societies."&lt;ref name=Boer/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; 
 
Bawer blames the problem not only on Muslims, but on what he implies is a latent bigotry amongst Europeans,&lt;ref name=TN&amp;O/&gt; which leads them to marginalize and isolate immigrant communities in the name of multiculturalism. He compares this approach unfavorably with what he sees as the American "melting pot" tradition, in which immigrants are expected to adopt American values and fully integrate into the wider society.&lt;ref name=Boer/&gt;

Due to what he asserts is a rapidly growing Muslim demographic, Bawer foresees "a long twilight of [[Balkanization]] with Europe divided into warring pockets of Muslims and non-Muslims."&lt;ref name=Time/&gt; Bawer warns that without a change of direction, Europe may eventually face a stark choice between "cultural surrender or full-fledged civil war."&lt;ref name=Globe/&gt;

Bawer also believes that anti-Americanism has led Europe to reject America's hard line on Islamic extremism and tolerate dangerous pockets of [[radical Islam]] in its midst:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"In the end, Europe's enemy is not Islam, or even radical Islam. Europe's enemy is itself—its self-destructive passivity, its softness toward tyranny, its reflexive inclination to appease, and its uncomprehending distaste for America's pride, courage, and resolve in the face of a deadly foe."&lt;ref name=Simon/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Critical reception==

According to ''Public Eye'' magazine, reviews of ''While Europe Slept'' were "easily sorted along ideological grounds", with conservatives generally praising the book while liberals repudiated it.&lt;ref name=PRA/&gt; Some critics suggested that the book raised important or timely questions, but criticized its methodology and/or conclusions.

In an article published in ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'', [[Walter Laqueur]] writes that "''While Europe Slept'' is an angry book, well written and well informed. And it could not, of course, be more timely."&lt;ref name=Laqueur/&gt; J. Peder Zane of the [[National Book Critics Circle]] wrote that the book offers "urgent prose that challenges widely held ideas" in addition to "provocative—and controversial—arguments". A review in ''[[American Thinker]]'' described the book as simply a "stunner" with "horrific" implications for the future of Europe.&lt;ref name=Thinker/&gt;

Zane thinks the book "begs innumerable qualifications" when it bluntly states that "European Muslims are hostile to 'pluralism, tolerance, democracy and sexual equality'", but believes that Bawer addresses those qualifications. Zane suggests that Bawer, who is openly gay, is concerned about what could happen to European gay communities if Islamists succeed in establishing [[Sharia]] law that is hostile to homosexuals.&lt;ref name=TN&amp;O/&gt;

Although Zane believes that drawing conclusions based upon "anecdotes" "is always dicey", he concedes that "Bawer catalogs many incidents in which officials excuse Muslim rapists because their Western victims 'dressed provocatively,' attribute gay-bashing incidents to general anger at 'oppression' and [[anti-Semitic]] violence to [[Israel]]'s treatment of the [[Palestinian people|Palestinian]]s."&lt;ref name=TN&amp;O/&gt;

Some reviewers strongly criticized the book. Denis Staunton wrote in ''[[The Irish Times]]'' that "Bawer will do anything to discover the dark side of Muslims in Europe, whom he accuses of everything from swindling the welfare system to supporting terrorists."&lt;ref name=Staunton/&gt; Simon Kuper, in the ''[[Financial Times]]'', described the book's central "[[Eurabia]]" thesis as "ludicrous".&lt;ref name=FT/&gt;

According to Kuper, Bawer's book, like others of its kind, "start with disclaimers that not all Muslims support terrorist jihad. This is then swiftly forgotten as the plans for jihad in Europe are outlined." Kuper rejects the claim that Muslims are any kind of demographic threat, asserting that Muslims comprise "less than 4 percent" of the EU population, and that their allegedly high birth rates are rapidly falling into line with that of other Europeans. Like a number of other reviewers, Kuper complains that Bawer's book is poorly documented: "Any source will do: Bawer cites [[Bat Ye'or|[Bat] Ye'or]], an Amsterdam taxi driver, a woman in a Swedish bar, or often no source at all." He concludes that the "target market" for such books "seems to be the US ... because hardly anybody who actually lives in Europe could take these dystopias seriously."&lt;ref name=FT/&gt;

A review in ''[[The Economist]]'' suggests that Bawer's homosexuality "may have sensitized him to the clash brewing between immigrant communities, who by and large reject European attitudes toward women and sexuality, and native Europeans for whom such cultural liberalism has become a core value." Noting that Bawer "understands the importance" of distinguishing between moderate Muslims and radicals, ''The Economist'' continues:&lt;ref name=Economist/&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;"In practice, though, he seems incapable of maintaining the distinction for long. On one page, he approvingly quotes a Muslim liberal who says, “There's a big difference between a Muslim and an Islamist, just as big a difference as between a German and a Nazi.” A few pages later, he uses wildly exaggerated statistics to give warning that Muslim birth rates will soon turn Europe into “Eurabia”. The Muslim share of Switzerland's population is not an “astonishing 20%”, as Mr Bawer claims, but 4.3%, at least according to the 2000 Swiss census."&lt;ref name=Economist/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Steven Simon in ''[[The Washington Post]]'' argues that "the book usefully crystallizes, without undue distortion, the apprehensions of many Europeans about what has become a dire cultural predicament", but notes: "With not a single endnote and virtually no data other than the author's personal experiences and conversations, ''While Europe Slept'' is not going to ring scholarly chimes, and the spirits of [[Oswald Spengler|Spengler]] and [[Winston Churchill|Churchill]] evoked by its overwrought title will alienate many specialists".&lt;ref name=Simon/&gt;

Writing in ''[[The Boston Globe]]'', Eric Weinberger offered more nuanced criticism. He finds the first part of the book "credible", arguing that Bawer's "claims are sometimes eccentric, but his critique of the EU and its elites is bracing and commonsensical". The second part, Weinberger characterizes as "alarmist in the way of good pamphlets: The argument is worth having, but any kind of prediction seems too pat. I say "pamphlet" because it is not truly a reporting project ... much of the book's facts, statistics, and quotations clearly come off the Internet." Weinberger also notes the book's lack of sourcing, observing that "There are no footnotes, no bibliography and few citations – strange for a critic trained as a scholar, and a pity, for startling facts require careful verification".&lt;ref name=Globe/&gt;

===Award controversy===

''While Europe Slept'' was nominated for the [[National Book Critics Circle Award]] in the 2006 "Criticism" category, a choice condemned in some quarters. The board's president, John Freeman, wrote that he had "never been more embarrassed by a choice than I have been with Bruce Bawer’s ''While Europe Slept''", adding that in his opinion, Bawer's "hyperventilated rhetoric tips from actual critique into [[Islamophobia]]".&lt;ref name="NYT"/&gt; A former winner of the Award, Eliot Weinberger, labelled the book "racism as criticism".&lt;ref name="NYT"/&gt;

A member of the Critics Circle committee, [[J. Peder Zane]], defended the nomination, stating that it "wasn't a contentious selection". Zane criticized comments made by Weinberger, saying "He not only was completely unfair to Bruce Bawer, he’s also saying that those of us who put the book on the finalist list are racist or too stupid to know we’re racist."&lt;ref name="NYT"/&gt;

Bawer himself characterized the criticism as symptomatic of one of the very problems he had sought to address in the book:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"One of the most disgraceful developments of our time is that many Western authors and intellectuals who pride themselves on being liberals have effectively aligned themselves with an outrageously illiberal movement that rejects equal rights for women, that believes gays and Jews should be executed, that supports the coldblooded murder of one’s own children in the name of honor, etc., etc."&lt;ref name="NYT"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Bawer's book ultimately lost in its category to [[Lawrence Weschler]]'s ''Everything That Rises''.&lt;ref name=Italie/&gt;

A '''wound''' is a type of [[injury]] which happens relatively quickly in which [[skin]] is torn, cut, or punctured (an ''open'' wound), or where blunt force [[physical trauma|trauma]] causes a [[bruise|contusion]] (a ''closed'' wound). In [[pathology]], it specifically refers to a sharp injury which damages the [[dermis]] of the skin.

==Classification==
According to level of contamination, a wound can be classified as:
* Clean wound – made under sterile conditions where there are no organisms present, and the skin is likely to heal without complications.
* Contaminated wound – usually resulting from accidental injury; there are pathogenic organisms and foreign bodies in the wound.
* Infected wound – the wound has pathogenic organisms present and multiplying, exhibiting clinical signs of infection (yellow appearance, soreness, redness, oozing [[pus]]).
* Colonized wound – a chronic situation, containing pathogenic organisms, difficult to heal (i.e. [[Pressure ulcer|bedsore]]).

===Open===
Open wounds can be classified according to the object that caused the wound:
* Incisions or incised wounds – caused by a clean, sharp-edged object such as a [[knife]], [[razor]], or glass splinter.
* Lacerations – irregular tear-like wounds caused by some [[blunt trauma]]. Lacerations and incisions may appear  linear (regular) or stellate (irregular). The term ''laceration'' is commonly misused in reference to incisions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Pediatrics|first1=American Academy of|title=First Aid for Families|date=2011|publisher=Jones &amp; Bartlett |isbn=978-0763755522|page=39|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6NDmgAL22s4C&amp;pg=PA39|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Abrasion (medical)|Abrasions]] (grazes) – superficial wounds in which the topmost layer of the [[skin]] (the epidermis) is scraped off. Abrasions are often caused by a sliding fall onto a rough surface such as [[asphalt]], [[tree bark]] or [[concrete]].
* [[Avulsion (injury)|Avulsions]] – injuries in which a body structure is forcibly detached from its normal point of insertion. A type of [[amputation]] where the extremity is pulled off rather than cut off. When used in reference to skin avulsions, the term '[[degloving]]' is also sometimes used as a synonym.
* [[Puncture wound]]s – caused by an object puncturing the [[skin]], such as a [[splinter]], nail or [[Hypodermic needle|needle]].
* [[penetrating trauma|Penetration wounds]] – caused by an object such as a knife entering and coming out from the skin.
* [[ballistic trauma|Gunshot wounds]] – caused by a [[bullet]] or similar projectile driving into or through the body. There may be two wounds, one at the site of entry and one at the site of exit, generally referred to as a "through-and-through."

===Closed===
Closed wounds have fewer categories, but are just as dangerous as open wounds:
* [[Hematoma]]s (or blood tumor) – caused by damage to a [[blood vessel]] that in turn causes [[blood]] to collect under the [[skin]].
** Hematomas that originate from internal blood vessel pathology are [[petechiae]], [[purpura]], and [[ecchymosis]]. The different classifications are based on size.
** Hematomas that originate from an external source of trauma are [[contusion]]s, also commonly called bruises.
* [[Crush injury]] – caused by a great or extreme amount of force applied over a long period of time.

===Complications===
[[File:Xraymachine.JPG|thumb|The patient has a deep wound at the knee, and [[radiography]] is used to ensure there are no hidden [[bone fractures]].]]
[[Infection|Bacterial infection]] of wound can impede the healing process and lead to life-threatening complications. Scientists at [[Sheffield University]] have used light to rapidly detect the presence of [[bacteria]], by developing a portable kit in which specially designed molecules emit a light signal when bound to bacteria. Current laboratory-based detection of bacteria can take hours or days.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Light to detect wound infection|work=UK scientists have identified a way of using light to rapidly detect the presence of bacteria|publisher=BBC News|date=11 March 2007|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/6427787.stm|format=web|accessdate=17 March 2008|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070822194515/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/6427787.stm|archivedate=22 August 2007|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Workup====
Wounds that are not healing should be investigated to find the causes; many microbiological agents may be responsible. The basic workup includes evaluating the wound, its extent and severity. Cultures are usually obtained both from the wound site and blood. [[X-ray]]s are obtained and a [[Tetanus vaccine|tetanus shot]] may be administered if there is any doubt about prior vaccination.&lt;ref&gt;[http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/188988-diagnosis Work Up] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100131022943/http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/188988-diagnosis |date=31 January 2010 }} eMedicine General Surgery. Retrieved 27 January 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

====Chronic====
Non-healing wounds of the [[Diabetes|diabetic]] foot are considered one of the most significant complications of diabetes, representing a major worldwide medical, social, and economic burden that greatly affects patient quality of life. Almost 24 million Americans—one in every twelve—are diabetic and the disease is causing widespread disability and death at an epidemic pace, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.  Of those with diabetes, 6.5 million are estimated to suffer with chronic or non-healing wounds. Associated with inadequate circulation, poorly functioning veins, and immobility, non-healing wounds occur most frequently in the elderly and in people with diabetes—populations that are sharply rising as the nation ages and chronic diseases increase.

Although diabetes can ravage the body in many ways, non-healing ulcers on the feet and lower legs are common outward manifestations of the disease. Also, diabetics often suffer from nerve damage in their feet and legs, allowing small wounds or irritations to develop without awareness. Given the abnormalities of the microvasculature and other side effects of diabetes, these wounds take a long time to heal and require a specialized treatment approach for proper healing.

As many as 25% of diabetic patients will eventually develop foot ulcers, and recurrence within five years is 70%. If not aggressively treated, these wounds can lead to amputations. It is estimated that every 30 seconds a lower limb is amputated somewhere in the world because of a diabetic wound. Amputation often triggers a downward spiral of declining quality of life, frequently leading to disability and death. In fact, only about one third of diabetic amputees will live more than five years, a survival rate equivalent to that of many cancers.

Many of these lower extremity amputations can be prevented through an interdisciplinary approach to treatment involving a variety of advanced therapies and techniques, such as debridement, hyperbaric oxygen treatment therapy, dressing selection, special shoes, and patient education.  When wounds persist, a specialized approach is required for healing.&lt;ref&gt;"The Clinical Case for Use of Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy in the Treatment of Diabetic Wounds," Diversified Clinical Services, copyright 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pathophysiology==
{{main|Wound healing}}
To [[healing|heal]] a wound, the body undertakes a series of actions collectively known as the [[wound healing]] process.

==Diagnosis==
A wound may be recorded for follow-up and observing progress of healing with different techniques which include:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Thomas|first=A.C.|author2=Wysocki, A.B.|title=The healing wound: a comparison of three clinically useful methods of measurement|journal=Decubitus|date=February 1990|volume=3|issue=1|pages=18–20, 24–25|pmid=2322408}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Photographs, with subsequent area quantification using computer processing
* Wound tracings on acetate sheets
* Kundin wound gauge

==Management==
[[File:wound sewed.jpg|thumb|Wound, sewn with four [[surgical suture|stitches]]]]
The overall treatment depends on the type, cause, and depth of the wound, and whether other structures beyond the skin (dermis) are involved. Treatment of recent lacerations involves examining, cleaning, and closing the wound.  Minor wounds, like bruises, will heal on their own, with skin discoloration usually disappearing in 1–2 weeks. [[Abrasion (medical)|Abrasions]], which are wounds with intact skin (non-penetration through dermis to subcutaneous fat), usually require no active treatment except keeping the area clean, initially with soap and water. [[Puncture wound]]s may be prone to infection depending on the depth of penetration. The entry of puncture wound is left open to allow for bacteria or debris to be removed from inside.

===Cleaning===
Evidence to support the cleaning of wounds before closure is scant.&lt;ref name=Cochrane2012&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors = Fernandez R, Griffiths R|title=Water for wound cleansing|journal=Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|date=15 February 2012|volume=2|issue=2|pages=CD003861|pmid=22336796|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD003861.pub3}}&lt;/ref&gt; For simple lacerations, cleaning can be accomplished using a number of different solutions, including [[tap water]] and [[Saline (medicine)|sterile saline solution]].&lt;ref name=Cochrane2012/&gt; Infection rates may be lower with the use of tap water in regions where water quality is high.&lt;ref name=Cochrane2012/&gt; Cleaning of a wound is also known as 'wound toilet'.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.patient.info/doctor/Simple-Wound-Management-and-Suturing.htm Simple wound management] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150627014103/http://patient.info/doctor/Simple-Wound-Management-and-Suturing.htm |date=27 June 2015 }}'', patient.info (website), accessed 8 January 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

===Closure===
If a person presents to a healthcare center within 6 hours of a laceration they are typically closed immediately after evaluating and cleaning the wound. After this point in time, however, there is a theoretical concern of increased risks of infection if closed immediately.&lt;ref name="Eliya2013"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Eliya-Masamba|first=Martha C.|last2=Banda|first2=Grace W.|date=2013-10-22|year=|title=Primary closure versus delayed closure for non bite traumatic wounds within 24 hours post injury|url=|journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|volume=|issue=10|pages=CD008574|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD008574.pub3|issn=1469-493X|pmid=24146332|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus some healthcare providers may delay closure while others may be willing to immediately close up to 24 hours after the injury.&lt;ref name="Eliya2013" /&gt; Using clean non-sterile gloves is equivalent to using sterile gloves during wound closure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Brewer|first1=JD|last2=Gonzalez|first2=AB|last3=Baum|first3=CL|last4=Arpey|first4=CJ|last5=Roenigk|first5=RK|last6=Otley|first6=CC|last7=Erwin|first7=PJ|title=Comparison of Sterile vs Nonsterile Gloves in Cutaneous Surgery and Common Outpatient Dental Procedures: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.|journal=JAMA Dermatology|date=1 September 2016|volume=152|issue=9|pages=1008–14|pmid=27487033|doi=10.1001/jamadermatol.2016.1965}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If closure of a wound is decided upon a number of techniques can be used. These include [[bandage]]s, a [[2-Octyl cyanoacrylate|cyanoacrylate]] glue, [[Surgical staple|staples]], and [[Surgical suture|sutures]].  Absorbable sutures have the benefit over non absorbable sutures of not requiring removal. They are often preferred in children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bestbets.org/bets/bet.php?id=874|title=BestBets: Absorbable sutures in pediatric lacerations|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081226233442/http://www.bestbets.org/bets/bet.php?id=874|archivedate=26 December 2008|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Buffering the [[pH]] of [[lidocaine]] makes the injection less painful.&lt;ref name="pmid21154371"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Cepeda MS, Tzortzopoulou A, Thackrey M, Hudcova J, Arora Gandhi P, Schumann R | title = Adjusting the pH of lidocaine for reducing pain on injection | journal = The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews | volume = | issue = 12 | pages = CD006581 | date = December 2010 | pmid = 21154371 | doi = 10.1002/14651858.CD006581.pub2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Adhesive glue and sutures have comparable cosmetic outcomes for minor lacerations &lt;5&amp;nbsp;cm in adults and children.&lt;ref name=Cals&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cals|first=J.W.|author2=de Bont EGPM|title=Minor incised traumatic laceration|journal=BMJ|year=2012|url=http://www.bmj.com/content/345/bmj.e6824|doi=10.1136/bmj.e6824|volume=345|pages=e6824|pmid=23092899|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131105202631/http://www.bmj.com/content/345/bmj.e6824|archivedate=5 November 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The use of adhesive glue involves considerably less time for the doctor and less pain for the person. The wound opens at a slightly higher rate but there is less redness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Farion|first=K|title=Tissue adhesives for traumatic lacerations in children and adults|journal=Cochrane Database Syst Rev|year=2002|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD003326|editor1-last=Farion|editor1-first=Ken J.|pmid=12137689|issue=3|pages=CD003326|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; The risk for infections (1.1%) is the same for both. Adhesive glue should not be used in areas of high tension or repetitive movements, such as joints or the posterior trunk.&lt;ref name="Cals"/&gt;

===Dressings===
In the case of clean surgical wounds, there is no evidence that the use of [[Antibacterial|topical antibiotics]] reduces infection rates in comparison with non-antibiotic ointment or no ointment at all.&lt;ref name="AADfive"&gt;{{Citation|author1=American Academy of Dermatology|author1-link=American Academy of Dermatology|date=February 2013|title=Five Things Physicians and Patients Should Question|publisher=[[American Academy of Dermatology]]|work=[[Choosing Wisely]]: an initiative of the [[ABIM Foundation]]|url=http://www.choosingwisely.org/doctor-patient-lists/american-academy-of-dermatology/|accessdate=5 December 2013|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131201171621/http://www.choosingwisely.org/doctor-patient-lists/american-academy-of-dermatology/|archivedate=1 December 2013|df=dmy-all}}, which cites

===Alternative medicine===
There is moderate evidence that honey is more effective than antiseptic followed by gauze for healing wounds infected after surgical operations. There is a lack of quality evidence relating to the use of honey on other types of wounds, such as minor acute wounds, mixed acute and chronic wounds, pressure ulcers, Fournier's gangrene, venous leg ulcers, diabetic foot ulcers and Leishmaniasis.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=|title=Honey as a topical treatment for wounds|vauthors=Jull AB, Cullum N, Dumville JC, Westby MJ, Deshpande S, Walker N|date=6 March 2015|journal=Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD005083.pub4|pmid=25742878|volume=3|issue=3|pages=CD005083}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Treatment of wound with lance grit.jpg|thumb|upright|Medieval treatment of wound with lance grittings]]
From the [[Classical antiquity|Classical Period]] to the [[Medieval Period]], the body and the soul were believed to be intimately connected, based on several theories put forth by the philosopher [[Plato]]. Wounds on the body were believed to correlate with wounds to the soul and vice versa; wounds were seen as an outward sign of an inward illness. Thus, a man who was wounded physically in a serious way was said to be hindered not only physically but spiritually as well. If the soul was wounded, that wound may also eventually become physically manifest, revealing the true state of the soul.&lt;ref name=Gawain&gt;{{cite journal|author=Reichardt, Paul F.|title=Gawain and the image of the wound|journal=PMLA|year=1984|volume=99|issue=2|pages=154–61|doi=10.2307/462158|jstor=462158}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wounds were also seen as writing on the "tablet" of the body. Wounds acquired in war, for example, told the story of a soldier in a form which all could see and understand, and the wounds of a [[martyr]] told the story of their faith.&lt;ref name=Gawain/&gt;

==Research==
In humans and mice it has been shown that estrogen might affect the speed and quality of wound healing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/524313_3|vauthors = ((Desiree May Oh, MD)), ((Tania J.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2188">'''Zarir''' (also spelled '''Zarih''') was a [[Sasanian]] prince who was the leader of a rebellion in northern [[Sasanian Empire|Iran]] in 485.

According to [[Armenians|Armenian]] historian [[Ghazar Parpetsi]], who is the only source about the life of Zarir, the latter was a son of the Sasanian [[shah]] [[Yazdegerd II]]. He had several brothers named [[Balash]], [[Hormizd III]], and [[Peroz I]]. After the death of Peroz I (who had succeeded his father as king), Balash was elected as king by the nobility and clergy. Zarir, dissatisfied with the election, rebelled. Balash was thus forced to make peace with his enemy [[Vahan Mamikonian]] and sent him at the head of an army to suppress the rebellion of Zarir. Zarir was shortly defeated, and fled to the mountains, but was quickly captured and "shot down like an animal".
