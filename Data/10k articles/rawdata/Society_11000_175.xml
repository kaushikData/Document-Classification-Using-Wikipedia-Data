== Controversies  ==
In 2006, a Federal investigation was launched into hiring practices at [[Chicago City Hall]]. HDO and other political groups allegedly have had influence over the city's hiring system and political workers allegedly have been rewarded with city jobs and promotions.

Aaron del Valle is alleged to have assisted [[Al Sanchez]], an [[Hispanic Democratic Organization|HDO]] leader, in coordinating HDO activities and was charged with perjury for allegedly lying to the federal grand jury about his HDO activities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cbs2chicago.com/topstories/aaron.del.valle.2.336064.html cbs2chicago.com - Former Top Daley Aide Indicted For Fraud&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081012062358/http://cbs2chicago.com/topstories/aaron.del.valle.2.336064.html |date=October 12, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Del Valle was considered Sanchez's lieutenant in the HDO organization.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9847">'''Abortion in Guatemala''' is illegal, except when needed to save the woman's life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.womenonwaves.org/en/page/4921/abortion-law-guatemala|title=Abortion Law Guatemala|first=Marc|last=Worrell|date=|website=Women on Waves|accessdate=16 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Abortion was illegal without exception prior to 1973. Congressional Decree 17-73 altered the penal code to allow [[abortion]] in cases in which the [[pregnancy|pregnant]] woman's life is endangered in September 1973. The procedure must be done by a [[physician]] and approved by a second doctor.

Article 3 of Chapter I in Title II of the [[Constitution of Guatemala]] grants the [[right to life]] from the point of [[fertilisation|conception]]. This article states that the government "guarantee and protects human life since its conception, as same as the integrity and security of the person."

==History and general context==
Articles 133 to 140 in Guatemala's Constitution detail the imprisonment sentences for women and doctors who seek or perform abortions. The length of the sentences varies based on the context of the abortion. Some factors that affect the sentencing are: whether the involved parties had knowledge of pregnancy, if there was consent of the woman and if violence contributed to the abortion.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite news|title=Abortion Policies: A Global Review|agency=United Nations|publisher=United Nations Population Division}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is an increase in the severity of punishment for nonconsensual abortions and abortions because of assault. However, abortion is strictly illegal in instances of the preservation of physical health, mental health, rape, incest, fetal impairment, economic or social reasons or by request. Abortion is only permitted in Guatemala to save the woman's life given that all other means of saving her life had been tried.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;
The government has attempted to lower the mortality rates of mothers and infants from induced abortions by advocating for the use of [[Birth control|contraception]] as a preventive measure for an unwanted pregnancy. The method of contraception most commonly used is [[Sterilization (medicine)|sterilization]], which accounted for 60% of all the contraceptive use in Guatemala in 1995.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; In 1995, the contraceptive use among married women in Guatemala ages 15–44 was 27% and grew to 43% in 2002.&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Singh|first1=Susheela|last2=Prada|first2=Elena|last3=Kestler|first3=Edgar|title=Induced Abortion and Unintended Pregnancy in Guatemala|publisher=International Family Planning Perspectives}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, unmet need for contraception among women in this age range rose from 19% to 28% from 1987 to 2002&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt; showing how the reproductive health services in Guatemala are insufficient to help the entire population.

===Current political debate===
Since 1973, the Guatemalan government has expressed concern over the number of induced abortions. This has led to discussion over the number of health clinics that treat women suffering from complications from an induced abortion. There are one hundred and eighty-three health clinics in [[Guatemala]] that treat the effects of an induced abortion. They are mainly concentrated in the Southwest and Metropolitan regions of the country, where abortion rates are the highest.  However, the population in these areas is so dense that there are less health clinics per woman than there are in other areas of the country. Most areas in Guatemala have twelve to thirteen health clinics per one hundred thousand women, but in the Southwest and Metropolitan regions there are only seven facilities per one hundred thousand women. In some regions, the ratio is as low as four clinics per one hundred thousand women.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;

===Role of religion===
Revisiting the abortion law and access to health clinics and contraception in Guatemala can be difficult, given the prominence of [[Catholicism]] in the country. In schools, there is little to no teaching on comprehensive [[sex education]] because of the influence of the [[Catholic Church]].&lt;ref name="auto2"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Erickson|first1=Amanda|title=Dutch Vessel Offering Abortion Services Docked in Guatemala. The Army Seized It|publisher=Washington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, it was estimated that 65-70% of the Guatemalan population was Catholic.&lt;ref name="auto3"&gt;{{cite news|title=Guatemala-International Religious Freedom Report 2009|agency=US State Dept.|publisher=US State Dept.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, the Catholic Church is very politically active. They participate in the Foro Guatemala, established in August 2001, that allows organizations and institutions to discuss issues of national importance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Foro Guatemala|agency=ASIES|publisher=ASIES}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="auto3"/&gt; It provides a space for religious groups to voice views on abortion that influence the election and activities of politicians who are responsible for shaping Guatemalan law on abortion. Since the stance of the Catholic Church is conservative on abortion, Guatemala has strict abortion laws.

==Current legal status and punishment==
The law is divided into eight different articles numbered 133-140. The first article establishes Guatemala's legal definition of abortion as "the death of the product of conception at any time of pregnancy", while the rest address the imprisonment punishments associated with abortion.

Article 134 states that "a woman who causes her abortion or consents to another person causing it, shall be punished with imprisonment of one to three years.  If driven for reasons linked intimately to her state that produce undoubted psychic disturbance, the penalty shall be imprisonment of six months to two years".

Article 135 concerns the role of consent in an abortion. If the woman consents to the abortion then the imprisonment term for the woman and the person who performs the procedure is one to three years. If the abortion is carried out intentionally without the consent of the woman then imprisonment is extended to three to six years. This article also addresses the nature of the abortion, stating that if "violence, threat, or deceit has been employed, the penalty shall be imprisonment of four to eight years".

Article 136 addresses the punishment for the person who incurred the abortion if the woman dies. If she consented and then died the punishment is three to eight years but if she did not consent then imprisonment is four to twelve years.

Article 137 states that an abortion with the consent of the woman and with the support of another doctor is not punishable if the death of the fetus was not intentional and was solely a result of trying to save the life of the mother, given that all other means of saving her were utilized.

Article 138 addresses unintended abortion. If violence occurs and an abortion is unintentionally caused while it is obvious that the victim is pregnant then imprisonment for the person responsible for the violence is one to three years. If there are injuries incurred onto the woman that are more than just an abortion then the length of imprisonment is increased by one third.

Article 139 address negligent abortion which is punished by one to three years' imprisonment given the woman knew she was pregnant.

Article 140 addresses specific aggravation related to abortion and states that "A doctor who, abusing his or her profession, causes the abortion or cooperates in it shall be punished with the penalties provided for in Article 135, with a fine of five hundred to three thousand quetzals, with disqualification of exercising his or her profession for two to five years".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Abortion Laws of the World|publisher=Annual Review of Population Law}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Effects of illegalization==

===Induced abortions and abortion rates===
In Guatemala, there are around 65,000 induced abortions performed each year, of which around 21,600 require hospitalization for complications.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt; The abortion rate in Guatemala is about 24 per 1,000 women ages 15–49. The abortion rate is slightly higher in the southwest region of Guatemala, which is less developed and consists of a mostly indigenous population, and in metropolitan regions which have a high population concentration. In these areas of the country, abortions occur at a rate of about 29-30 per 1,000 women in the same age range. Nationally, the unintended pregnancy rate is around 66 per 1,000 women, meaning that about half of all unintended pregnancies result in a woman attempting an induced abortion&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;

==Controversy==
On February 24, 2017, a vessel docked in port of [[Puerto Quetzal]], run by a group called [[Women on Waves]], to provide [[abortions pill]]s in international waters. The vessel, though it claimed it had permit rights to dock in Guatemala, was forced to leave by the Guatemalan army under orders from President [[Jimmy Morales]] and women were kept from boarding.&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt; The Guatemalan government justified their actions by stating that they were defending "human life and the laws of the country".

'''Abul Hasan Qutb Shah''' (Abul Hasan '''Tana Shah''') was the eighth and last ruler of the [[Qutb Shahi dynasty]], sovereign of the kingdom of [[Golconda]] in [[South India]]. Tana Shah's reign was from 1672 to 1686.

== Title of 'Tana Shah' And Shah Raju Qattal Hussaini ==
[[File:Govardhan II, Visit of sufi-singer Shir Muhammad to Abul Hasan Qutb Shah, ca. 1720, Bibliothèque nationale de France, Paris.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Visit of Sufi-singer Shir Muhammad to Abul Hasan Qutb Shah, ca. 1720, [[Bibliothèque Nationale de France]], Paris.]]

Although his real name was Abul Hasan, he was nicknamed 'Tana Shah' even before he became a contender to the throne of Golconda by his teacher, a [[Sufi]] saint called Syed Shah Raziuddin Multani, popularly known as Shah Raju Qattaal. Shah Raju was eighth in the lineage of the Sufi saint Syedna Khwaja Banda Nawaz [[Gesu daraz]] of [[Gulbarga]]. Abul Hassan had a good voice and sang well. He also had a certain innocence about him. Shah Raju, therefore, gave him the nickname of `Tana Shah' which means a child saint.&lt;ref&gt;Narendra Luther Archives-Strange life of Tana Shah&lt;/ref&gt; He was also known as '''Tani Shah''', meaning "benevolent ruler".

He is remembered as a popular statesman who did not discriminate against those of another ethnicity or religion. He hired [[Telugu Brahmins|Brahmin]]s as his ministers and generals. For example, [[Madanna and Akkanna]], Brahmin brothers from [[Hanamakonda|Hanamkonda]], were his most important ministers. Tana Shah gained a place in Telugu literature due to [[Kancharla Gopanna]], nephew of Madanna. Kancharla Gopanna is famously known as "Ramadasu". Ramadasu lived in [[Nelakondapalli]] village in Palvancha taluk. Tani Shah hired him as a ''[[tehsildar]]'' (head of a revenue department) of Palvancha taluk. Ramadasu diverted the public funds to construct a [[Rama]] temple in [[Bhadrachalam]] and for jewelry to adorn the idols of [[Lord Rama]], [[Sita]] and [[Lakshmana]]. Tana Shah found Ramadasu guilty of misappropriation of public funds and put him in jail. After twelve years, Tana Shah released Ramadasu after getting Lord Rama in his dream and found Rammudras (golden coins with Lord Rama's image on it) beside him. Thereafter Tana Shah established a tradition to send pearls to the Badrachalam temple on every [[Rama Navami]] festival and was continued by his successors. The same tradition is continued to this day by the Government of the [[State of Telangana]].

Earlier Tana Shah's father-in-law, [[Abdullah Qutb Shah]], was forced by [[Aurangzeb]] to acknowledge the suzerainty of [[Shah Jahan]]. His other daughter (that is, younger sister of Tana Shah's wife) was married to [[Aurangzeb]]'s eldest son [[Muhammad Sultan (Mughal prince)|Sultan Muhammad]].

About the year 1683, Abul Hasan Qutb Shah appears to have become irregular in payment of taxes to the [[Mughals]] and his relations with [[Sikandar Adil Shah]] also caused concern among the Mughals. Abul Hasan Qutb Shah consequently refused to be a vassal of the [[Mughal Empire]] and prompted [[Aurangzeb]] to initiate a campaign to assert the rule of the [[Mughals]] on [[Golconda]]. He attacked Golconda with his commanders, Nawab Khwaja Abid Siddiqi (Qilich Khan) and Nawab Mir Ghaziuddin Khan Siddiqi Feroze Jung, father and grandfather of Nizam I (Asaf Jah I). Tana Shah defended the fort for eight months, but Aurangzeb succeeded in capturing Golconda at the end in September 1687. Abul Hasan Qutb Shah surrendered and handed over the [[Nur-Ul-Ain Diamond]], the [[Hope Diamond]], the [[Wittelsbach Diamond]] and [[the Regent Diamond]], making the [[Mughal Emperor]] [[Aurangzeb]] the richest monarch in the world.

Tana Shan was taken as a prisoner and was imprisoned in the [[Daulatabad, Maharashtra|Daulatabad]] Fort (near [[Aurangabad Maharashtra|Aurangabad]]), where he would die after twelve years of captivity. When the Sultan died, he was not buried alongside his ancestors and other Qutub Shahi Kings but in a modest grave at [[Khuldabad]] near [[Aurangabad Maharashtra|Aurangabad]].

Shah Raju Qattal Hussaini Sent A Pomegranate For Abul Hassan Qutub Shah but Tanashah Only Ate 14 Pieces So Shah Raju Qattal Hussaini Claimed That Tanashah Will Rule For 14 Years. And Tanashah Only Ruled For 14 Years

With the defeat of Abul Hasan Qutub Shah, the [[Qutb Shahi]] dynasty ended and a new [[Nizam]] dynasty began in Hyderabad under the control of the Mughal Dynasty.

After the fall of Golconda on 22 September 1687, it became a part of the six Mughal provinces in the [[Deccan Plateau|Deccan]]. Mahabat Khan, who was initially the commander of the Qutb Shahi army and had switched loyalty to the Mughals, was appointed the governor of Golconda, laying the foundations for the [[Hyderabad State]] under the [[Nizams]] by Aurangzeb.

According to [[Minority Rights Group International]], there are 156,000&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.minorityrights.org/5058/lebanon/lebanon-overview.html Lebanon Minorities Overview] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222064559/http://www.minorityrights.org/5058/lebanon/lebanon-overview.html |date=February 22, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Armenians in Lebanon, around 4% of the population. Prior to the [[Lebanese Civil War]], the number was higher, but the community lost a portion of its population to emigration. Prior to 1975, [[Beirut]] was a thriving center of Armenian culture with varied media production,&lt;ref&gt;Migliorino, Nicola. ''Constructing Armenia in Lebanon and Syria: Ethno-Cultural Diversity'', page 166&lt;!-- ISBN needed --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; which was exported to the [[Armenian diaspora]].

==History==
Armenians first established contact with Lebanon when [[Tigranes the Great]] conquered [[Phoenicia]] from the [[Seleucids]] and made it part of his short-lived Armenian Empire.  When the [[Roman Empire]] established its rule over both Armenia and ancient Lebanon, some Roman troops of Armenian origin went there in order to accomplish their duties as Romans. After Armenia converted to Christianity in 301, Armenian pilgrims established contact with Lebanon and its people on their way to [[Jerusalem]]; some of whom would settle there.{{Citation needed|date=October 2013}}

==Armenians in Lebanon (1915–1975)==
[[File:Armenian exiles.JPG|thumb|200px|right|Camp of Armenian exiles in Beirut]]
The Armenian presence in Lebanon during the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] period was minimal; however, there was a large influx of Armenians after the [[Armenian Genocide]] of 1915. Other Armenians inhabited the area of [[Karantina]] (literally "Quarantine", a port-side district in the Lebanese capital of [[Beirut]]). Later on, a thriving Armenian community was formed in the neighbouring district of [[Bourj Hammoud]].

In 1939, after the [[France|French]] ceded the [[Syria]]n [[territory (geographic region)|territory]] of [[Alexandretta]] to Turkey, Armenians and other [[Christians]] from the area moved to the [[Bekaa Valley]]. The Armenians were grouped in [[Anjar, Lebanon|Anjar]], where a community exists to this day. Some of these Armenian refugees had been settled by the [[French mandate]] authorities in camps in the South of Lebanon which would later make way for [[Palestinian refugees]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.group194.net/english/index.php?mode=menu&amp;id=32.camps%20in%20Lebanon]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:ArmeniansofLebanon.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Around 10,000 Lebanese-Armenians marching on April 24, 2006, on the 91st anniversary of the [[Armenian Genocide]]]]
During the Lebanese Civil War, Armenians, grouped in Bourj Hammoud and Anjar, did their best to remain neutral. There are three prominent Armenian political parties in Lebanon: the [[Armenian Revolutionary Federation]] (also Dashnak or Tashnag), [[Social Democrat Hunchakian Party]] (Hunchag) and [[Armenian Democratic Liberal Party]] (Ramgavar Party). They play significant influence in all facets of Armenian life. During this time militant organizations, such as [[ASALA]], [[JCAG]] and [[Armenian Revolutionary Army|ARA]] became active in Lebanon, and used it as a launching pad for their operations. ASALA was created by Armenian [[leftist nationalism|leftist nationalists]] in 1975 with support from allies in the [[Palestine Liberation Organization]] (PLO). The organization was headed by an Armenian [[militant]] named [[Monte Melkonian]], who received training from several Palestinian resistance organizations that were active in Lebanon. According to sources within ASALA, the group's leader [[Hagop Hagopian (guerrilla)|Hagop Hagopian]] became involved with [[Wadi Haddad]] and the [[Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine]]. Hagopian  Armenian Lebanese leftists also struck up an alliance with [[Kemal Jumblatt]]'s [[Progressive Socialist Party]]. The Dashnak Party, on the other hand, had allied with [[Pierre Gemayel]]'s right wing [[Phalangist]] party and the [[National Liberal Party (Lebanon)|National Liberal Party]] of [[Camille Chamoun]]. They created the militant [[Justice Commandos of the Armenian Genocide]] (JCAG) organization to help retain youth members after ASALA was founded.&lt;ref name=gunter&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = Springer| isbn = 978-0-230-11887-4| last = Gunter| first = M.| title = Armenian History and the Question of Genocide| date = 2011-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The Armenian bloc of the [[Lebanese Parliament]] put forth a resolution, calling for the commemoration of the anniversary of the [[Armenian genocide]]; the legislature unanimously approved the resolution on 4 April 1997&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cilicia.com/armo10i_lebanon.html Lebanon Recognizes the Armenian Genocide]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Armenian neighborhoods==
Armenians live in many parts of Lebanon. Historically most Armenians have lived in Beirut and [[Matn District]]. From Beirut proper we can mention grander Ashrafieh: Hadjen (Corniche Nahr), Khalil Badawi, Karm el Zeytoun (Հայաշէն), Rmeil, Jmmeyze, Soursok, and Jeitawi. Armenians have had strong presence also in other Beirut regions such as Khandaq Ghamik, [[Zuqaq al-Blat]], Zarif, Bab Idris, Sanayeh (Kantari), Clemenceau and Hamra, among others. During the civil war many of these Armenians emigrated or fled to safer regions in Lebanon. From the Beirut suburbs, there are big concentrations in Matn District, particularly Bourj Hammoud, Dora-Amanos, Fanar, Rawda, Jdeide, Zalka, Jal El Dib, [[Antelias]], Mzher (Dzaghgatzor), Naccash, Dbayeh, Awkar and in the regions situated from Antelias to Bikfaya. To the north, there are further Armenian populations scattered in Jounieh, Jbeil (Byblos) and Tripoli (particularly the Mina area). {{citation needed|date=October 2013}}

There are Armenian religious centers in Antelias and [[Bikfaya]] ([[Armenian Apostolic Church]]) and Beirut and [[Bzommar]] ([[Armenian Catholic Church]]). There is an Armenian orphanage in historic sites in Jbeil (Byblos).

In the Bekaa, there are Armenians living in [[Zahlé]] and most notably Anjar.

===Bourj Hammoud===
{{Main article|Bourj Hammoud}}
[[File:Bourj Hammoud01.jpg|250px|thumb|right|City Mall in a commercial area in Bourj Hammoud]]
Bourj Hammoud ({{lang-hy|'''Պուրճ Համուտ'''}}, {{lang-ar|'''برج حموﺪ'''}}) is a suburb in east Beirut, Lebanon in the Metn district. The suburb is heavily populated by Armenians as it is where most survivors of the Armenian genocide settled. Bourj Hammoud is an industrious area and is one of the most densely populated cities in the Middle East. It is divided into seven major regions, namely Dora, Sader, Nahr Beirut, Anbari, Mar Doumet, Naba'a and Gheilan. It is sometimes called "Little Armenia".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| title = The cultural cradle for Lebanon's Armenians| accessdate = 2018-11-21| url = https://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/inpictures/2015/11/cultural-cradle-lebanon-armenians-151112073614211.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bourj Hamoud has a majority Armenian population but also has a notable number of other Lebanese Christians, a considerable [[Shi'a]] Muslim population, a Kurdish population, and some Palestinian refugees and newcomer Christian refugees from [[Iraq]]. Most streets in Bourj Hammoud are named after various Armenian cities such as [[Yerevan]], mountains such as [[Aragats]], and rivers such as [[Araks]]. A lot of streets are also named after cities and regions in modern-day-Turkey which were heavily populated by Armenians such as [[Cilicia]], [[Marash]], [[Sis, Armenia|Sis]], [[Adana]], etc.

===Mezher (Dzaghgatzor)===
{{Main article|Mezher}}
Mzher (or Dzaghgatzor in Armenian) is a small town located between Antelias and Bsalim, in Matn district. It is a new town, where most of the population is Armenian, along with other Christians. In Mzher the Armenian community has one of the top Armenian schools, Melankton and Haig Arslanian College (Jemaran) and a socio-cultural sport club, Aghpalian. The headquarters of SAHALCO are also situated nearby. Most of the Armenians of Mzher come from Bourj Hamoud, Ashrafieh, Anjar and the other old Armenian quarters.

===Anjar===
{{Main article|Anjar, Lebanon}}
'''Anjar''' ({{lang|ar|عنجر}}, {{lang|hy|Այնճար}}), also known as '''Haoush Mousa''' ({{lang|ar|حوش موسى}}), is a town of Lebanon located in the [[Bekaa Valley]]. The population is about 2,400 consisting almost entirely of Armenians.

==Politics==
{{main|Lebanese politics}}
According to the traditional Lebanese confessional representation in the Lebanese Parliament, a certain number of seats have been reserved for Armenian candidates according to their confession. Presently the Lebanese-Armenians are represented in the 128-seat Lebanese Parliament with 6 guaranteed seats (5 Armenian Orthodox and 1 Armenian Catholic) as follows:
* 1 Armenian Orthodox and 1 Armenian Catholic seat in the [[Beirut I]] electoral district
* 2 Armenian Orthodox seats in the [[Beirut II]] electoral district
* 1 Armenian Orthodox seat in the [[Matn District]]
* 1 Armenian Orthodox seat in [[Zahle District]]

As many Protestants in Lebanon are ethnic Armenians, the sole parliamentary slot for Evangelical (Protestant) community has at times been filled by an Armenian, making for a total of 7 Armenian deputees in the Lebanese Parliament. Lebanese Armenians have been represented in government by at least one government minister in the formations of Lebanese governments. In case of larger governments (with 24 ministers and above) Armenians are traditionally given two government ministry positions. Lebanese-Armenians also have their quota in top-level public positions. {{citation needed|date=October 2013}}

Unlike the [[Maronite Church]] and other [[Religion in Lebanon|religious groups in Lebanon]], the Armenian Apostolic Church is not a political actor in its own right. Armenians do, however, enjoy political representation in Lebanon's [[multiconfessional]] government. Since the [[Cold War]] era, the Armenian Apostolic Church has participated in politics as a proxy for the ultranationalist [[Dashnak]] party.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = Routledge| isbn = 978-1-317-17856-9| last = Agadjanian| first = Alexander| title = Armenian Christianity Today: Identity Politics and Popular Practice| date = 2016-04-15 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Q0YHDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT169}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education==
[[File:Beirut Universitet Haigazian.jpg|thumb|200px|The [[Haigazian University]] campus in downtown Beirut]]
Lebanon is the location of the only Armenian university outside Armenia. [[Haigazian University]] was established in Beirut by the [[Armenian Missionary Association of America]] and the [[Union of the Armenian Evangelical Churches in the Near East]].&lt;ref name=beirut&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = Indiana University Press| isbn = 978-0-253-01755-0| pages = 82–106| editors = Sylvia Angelique Alajaji (ed.)| title = Music and the Armenian Diaspora| chapter = BEIRUT: 1932&amp;#x2013;1958| series = Searching for Home in Exile| accessdate = 2018-11-21| date = 2015| chapterurl = http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt16xwbgf.9| jstor = j.ctt16xwbgf.9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Founded in 1955, Haigazian is a liberal arts Armenian institution of higher learning, which uses English as the language of instruction.

Most Armenian schools are run by the three Armenian Christian denominations (Orthodox, Catholic and Evangelical). Others are run by cultural associations like Hamazkayin and Armenian General Benevolent Union (AGBU). {{citation needed|date=October 2013}} Notable schools include:
*[[Yeprem and Martha Philibosian Armenian Evangelical College|Armenian Evangelical College]] (Beirut)
*[[Armenian Evangelical Central High School]] (Ashrafieh, Beirut)

==Culture==
===Music===
{{main|Armenian music}}
[[Anatolian music|Anatolian]] and [[kef music]] were a source of controversy due to the shared [[Ottoman music|Ottoman]] past they represented in the post-genocide era. A combination of factors in Lebanon, including political independence and the strength of various Armenian institutions, created conditions that were permissive of the rise of an [[Armenian nationalism]] that was similar to the [[Turkish nationalism]] that emerged in the Ottoman Empire in the years leading up to the 1915 genocide. Music in the Lebanese diaspora became another means to separate "us" and "them", but also provided a space where Lebanese Armenians could connect with a concept of "home" in place of the Ottoman past and [[Soviet Armenia|Soviet]] present.&lt;ref name=beirut /&gt;

Community choirs that formed in Lebanon during the 1930s, led by former students of [[Komitas]], utilized the imagery of Komitas as the [[saint]] and [[martyr]] of [[Armenian music]]. These choirs proved to be critical in the development of [[collective identity]] amongst Lebanese Armenians. According to Sylvia Angelique Alajaji, a professor of music who has studied music in the Armenian diaspora, "in a literal and symbolic sense, the songs sung by the choirs articulated home and articulated belonging."&lt;ref name=beirut /&gt;

[[Armenian pop music]] thrived in 1970s Lebanon, until the outbreak of the Lebanese Civil War. Many artists fled Lebanon during those years including pop singer [[Adiss Harmandian]] and classical [[soprano]] singer [[Arpine Pehlivanian]]. Songs were released about the war including one by Manuel Menengichian with the lyrics "Brothers turned into lions against each other/ Tearing up your heart, Lebanon".&lt;ref name=migliorino&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = Berghahn Books| isbn = 978-1-84545-352-7| last = Migliorino| first = Nicola| title = (Re)constructing Armenia in Lebanon and Syria: Ethno-cultural Diversity and the State in the Aftermath of a Refugee Crisis| date = 2008 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rP4kg8cew2QC&amp;pg=PA125|page=125-167}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Theater===
{{main|Armenian theater}}
Like other cultural institutions of the Lebanese Armenian community, [[Armenian theater]] suffered during the years of the Lebanese Civil War. Many prominent figures decided to leave Lebanon; [[Berge Fazlian]], founder of the [[Vahram Papazian]] group, was among those who fled during the wartime violence. Though theater experience a decline during the war years, it does not disappear entirely; the groups that remained in Lebanon were able to put on productions that filled the two theraters of Bourj Hammoud.&lt;ref name=migliorino /&gt;

Fazlian is considered one of the most important figures in Lebanese theater; his theater projects were covered in Armenian, Arabic and French-language newspapers of the period. Fazlian was born in [[Istanbul]] in 1926; after obtaining his education in [[Turkey]] and directing several plays, a friendly colleague advised him to seek his fortune outside Turkey, imploring Fazlian to "never leave the theater", but also reminding him that an [[Armenians in Turkey|Armenian]] was not likely to land a leading role in Turkey. Fazlian left Istanbul in 1951 and settled in Beirut where he founded the ''Nor Pem'' (“New Stage”) theater group in 1956, Vahram Papazian in 1959, and ''Azad Pem'' (“Free Stage”) in 1971.&lt;ref name=mirror /&gt;  

Lebanon had only one theater group in Beirut prior to Fazlian's creation of the Vahram Papazian group and that was [[Hamazkayin]]'s [[Kasbar Ipegian]] theater company. Ipegian, who had settled in Beirut in 1930, was one of Hamazkayin's founders. Hamazkayin was the cultural arm of the [[Armenial Revolutionary Federation]] (ARF) or ''Dashnak'' party. The Hamazkayin Theater Association, which Ipegian founded in 1941, performed plays created by [[List of Armenian writers|Armenian writers]] like [[Levon Shant]] and [[Papken Papazian]]. Their self-stated mission was to "reestablish and spread the art of theater in the diaspora". This included enhancing "Armenian theater’s educational role in the preservation of national identity".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| title = Kasbar Ipegian Theater Company| work = Hamazkayin| accessdate = 2018-11-21| date = 2013-12-03| url = https://www.hamazkayin.com/en/about-us/kasbar-ipegian-theater-company/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=mirror&gt;{{Cite web| title = Tribute: Actor and Director Fazlian Played Important Role in Armenian and Lebanese Theater| work = The Armenian Mirror-Spectator| accessdate = 2018-11-21| date = 2016-02-25| url = https://mirrorspectator.com/2016/02/25/tribute-actor-and-director-fazlian-played-important-role-in-armenian-and-lebanese-theater/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=migoliorno /&gt;

Fazlian himself was a [[leftist]] and his group was associated the [[Armenian General Benevolent Union]] (AGBU), while Ipegian's group was associated with Hamazkayin and the Armenian Revolutionary Federation (ARF). There was a rivalry between the two groups.&lt;ref name=migliorino /&gt; Before Fazlian's group the only plays available were partisan plays presented by members of the ARF and their sympathesizers, who would perform in the Hamazkayin plays. On the other hand, Fazlian's Vahram Papazian group performed a variety of plays that included [[Western Armenian]], [[Eastern Armenian]] and even non-Armenian plays.&lt;ref name=mirror /&gt;

==Women==
{{main|Armenian women}}

In 1932 [[Siran Seza]], a Lebanese-Armenian writer, began publishing the first [[feminist]] literary review for women in Lebanon called ''The Young Armenian Women'' ({{lang|hy|Երիտասարդ Հայուհի}}, ''Yeritasard Hayuhi''). Seza was born in [[Constantinople]] (present day Istanbul) in 1903.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| last = Manoukian| first = Jennifer| title = The Child of a Refugee| work = The Armenian Weekly| accessdate = 2018-11-21| date = 2014-07-25| url = http://armenianweekly.com/2014/07/25/child-refugee/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Seza had transated [[Goethe]]'s ''[[The Sorrows of Young Werther]]'' into Armenian when she was 15; her talent was recognized by [[Armenian poetry|Armenian poet]]s of the era, such as [[Vahan Tekeyan]], which led to her work being published in important literary journals of that time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| publisher = The Institute| title = Al-Raida| date = 1994 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=c6nxAAAAMAAJ |issue=65-75}}&lt;/ref&gt; The final issue of ''The Young Armenian Women'' was published in 1968.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = Cambridge Scholars Press| isbn = 978-1-904303-23-7| last = Rowe| first = Victoria| title = A History of Armenian Women's Writing, 1880-1922| date = 2003 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mOvE4Ec-_oEC&amp;pg=PA132}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Armenian community in Lebanon developed educational institutions and organizations to address issues like [[poverty]], which were exacerbated by the violent conflict and crisis in Lebanon. The focus of these institutions was on women's role as mothers, which is not uncommon in times of war or violent conflict. They sought to kept Armenian children connected to the community by offering cultural activies like traditional [[Armenian dance]] and music. The three main Armenian churches ran private Armenian schools for the children; even the poorest Armenian families tried to enroll their children in private Armenian schools and they often needed NGO assistance to pay for the schoolbooks.&lt;ref name=nucho&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = Princeton University Press| isbn = 978-1-4008-8300-4| last = Nucho| first = Joanne Randa| title = Everyday Sectarianism in Urban Lebanon: Infrastructures, Public Services, and Power| date = 2016-11-22 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OslIDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA75 |page=75-78}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Life in the Armenian community of Bourj Hammoud was largely effected by [[gender]]. Non-Armenian men, even those who married [[Armenian women]], rarely carried significant influence (''[[wasta]]'') in the community's social networks. For example, access to the only low-income housing for Armenians was governed by a set of "unofficial rules"; in practice, this meant that Armenian men married to non-Armenian women could rent or purchase an apartment in the housing project, but Armenian women married to non-Armenian men would face significant hurdles to secure this type of housing.&lt;ref name=nucho /&gt;

==Economy==
[[Armenian American]] historian [[Richard G. Hovannisian]] has described what he calls the "economic vivacity" of the Armenian community in Lebanon in terms of the hundreds of Armenian owned shops in Beirut. The city's business quarter closes down on April 24th, on the anniversary of the Armenian genocide.&lt;ref name=hovannisian1974&gt;{{Cite journal| issn = 0026-3141| volume = 28| issue = 1| pages = 19–32| last = Hovannisian| first = Richard G.| title = The Ebb and Flow of the Armenian Minority in the Arab Middle East| journal = Middle East Journal| accessdate = 2018-11-23| date = 1974| url = http://www.jstor.org/stable/4325183| jstor = 4325183}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the years after [[World War II]], between 1946 and 1948, the [[Soviet Union]] sposored a repatriation campaign encouraging Armenians living in [[diaspora]] to move to [[Soviet Armenia]]. In Beirut, which had a relatively large Armenian community, the repatriation campaign impacted the economy and destabilized the community. As Armenians emigrated from Beirut, property values [[deflation|deflated]] and lower income Arabs like [[Mutawali]] (a branch of [[Shi'a]] Islam) began to move into the Armenian quarters of the city. Hovannisian has written that "This unwelcome infiltration of culturally less developed and rapidly multiplying Muslim elements has been bemoaned by the affected Armenians for a quarter of a century."&lt;ref name=hovannisian1974 /&gt;

==Media==
"Pyunik" was the first Armenian newspaper in Lebanon (replaced by Aztag in 1927).

===Press: Dailies===
There are three Armenian daily newspapers published in Beirut all mouthpieces of the traditional Armenian political parties (Tashnag, Hunchag and Ramgavar). 
*''[[Aztag (daily)|Aztag]]'', a daily newspaper that speaks on behalf of the [[Armenian Revolutionary Federation]] - Tashnag and was established in 1927. It also published an online English version and an online Arabic supplement. 
*''[[Ararad (daily)|Ararad]]'', a daily newspaper published by the [[Social Democrat Hunchakian Party]] - Hunchag Party
*''[[Zartonk (daily)|Zartonk]]'', daily newspaper is published by [[Armenian Democratic Liberal Party]] - Ramgavar and was established in 1937.

From the defunct Armenian political newspapers besides ''Pyunik'' in the 1920s, one should mention the independent non-partisan newspaper ''[[Ayk (daily)|Ayk]]'' (after decades of publishing in Armenian, the licence owner Lucie Tosbat sold it to ''Monday Morning'' Publishing Group and ''Ayk'' started publishing as an English-language daily renamed ''[[Ike (daily)|Ike]]'' before folding.) ''Ayk'' daily's Lebanese-Armenian publishers Dikran and Lucie Tosbat also published the French language ''Le Soir''.

Special mention should also be made for the Armenian leftist daily newspaper ''Joghovourti Tsayn'' (meaning Voice of the People) which had a short span of publication but remained influential during its span of publication. {{citation needed|date=October 2013}}

===Press: Weekly publications and periodicals===
Lebanon has a history of periodicals and weekly newspapers in the Armenian language. Notable long-running publications include:
*''[[Hask (periodical)|Hask]]'', official publication of the [[Holy See of Cilicia|Catholicosate of the Great House of Cilicia]] (Armenian Apostolic)
*''[[Avedik]]'', official publication of the [[Armenian Catholic Church]] 
*''Yeridasart Hayouhi'' (literary periodical dedicated to women) which was later turned into an independent political biweekly called ''Yeridasart Hay''.
*''Nor Gyank'' (New Life) the lifestyle newspaper/magazine
*''Gantch'', the Armenian Communist weekly (part of Arabic language communist "An Nidaa")
*''Khosnag'' the [[Armenian General Benevolent Union]] (AGBU) official publication

===Academic publications===
*''Hasg Hayakidagan Hantes'', an annual Armenological publication by the [[Holy See of Cilicia]]
*''[[Haigazian Armenological Review]]'', an annual Armenological publication of [[Haigazian University]]

===Radio===
The Lebanese state radio established very early on daily radio broadcasts in Armenian through its second channel consecrated to broadcasting in languages (mainly French and English). That programming goes on to date on Radio Liban. During the civil war, the Lebanese Armenians established a great number of unlicensed radio stations (some non-stop for 24 hours a day). The pioneer was the popular radio station "Radio Paradise" and later on "Vana Tsayn" (Voice of Van). However, with the Lebanese Parliament enacting laws organizing the airwaves, all the unlicensed stations (alongside the other Lebanese stations) had to close. They were replaced by two operating and fully licensed radio stations operating in Armenian in Lebanon in accordance with the new broadcast laws - "Voice of Van" and "Radio Sevan". {{citation needed|date=October 2013}}

===Television===
Lebanese private stations and state-owned [[Tele-Liban]] have consecrated occasionally television programming in Armenian on certain occasions. During the Lebanese civil war, an Armenian television station "Paradise Television" co-operated with "Radio Paradise" was established through a broadcast tower in Bourj Hammoud. But "Paradise Television" Armenian television station had to close after it failed to get a broadcasting licence according to the new laws organizing the airwaves. Al Mustaqbal Television (also known as [[Future Television]]) and [[OTV (Lebanon)|OTV]] broadcast daily 30-minutes news and comments in Armenian in their regular programming schedule. {{Clarify|date=October 2013}}

==Religion==
Officially, there are three Armenian denominations recognized by the government. The Armenians have Armenian Orthodox, Armenian Catholic, or Armenian Evangelical mentioned in their identity cards, in the denomination field. Sometimes, however, there are variations particularly in case of the Armenian Evangelicals, sometimes registered as just Evangelicals or Protestants without mention of Armenian. There are also some Armenian Catholics who are registered under the denomination Latin, sometimes Armenian Latin. {{citation needed|date=October 2013}}

===Apostolic (Orthodox) Armenians===

The [[Holy See of Cilicia]] is located in Antelias (a northern suburb of Beirut). It was relocated there in 1930 from Sis (historical Cilicia, now in Turkey) after the Armenian genocide.  Alongside the Mother See of Holy [[Echmiadzin]] located in [[Armenia]], it is one of the two sees of the Armenian Apostolic Church (the national church of Armenians). The Catholicos, the leader of the Holy See of Cilicia, has his summer residence in Bikfaya in the Matn District also north of Beirut.  The seminary of the Armenian Apostolic Church is also on site at Bikfaya. The affairs of the Lebanese Armenian Orthodox population however are run by an independent body, the [[Armenian Apostolic Diocese of Lebanon|Armenian Prelacy of Lebanon]] (Aratchnortaran Hayots Lipanani) with its own Armenian Primate of Lebanon Bishop Shahé Panossian as head. {{citation needed|date=October 2015}}

The Armenian Apostolic churches in Lebanon include:
*The Saint Gregory the Illuminator Mother Cathedral (Sourp Krikor Lousavoritch Mayr Dajar) which serves as the church for the [[Holy See of Cilicia]] (Catholicossate of the Great House of Cilicia - In Armenian "Gatoghigosaran Medzi Danen Guiligio" (Antelias, Lebanon). The big complex also contains a memorial chapel dedicated to the victims of the [[Armenian Genocide]], an Armenian library, printing presses, Armenian museum and "Veharan", residence of the catholicos of Cilicia and premises for the clergy.   
*Holy Sign (Saint Nshan) Armenian Orthodox Church (Downtown Beirut) which serves as the church for the Armenian Apostolic Archbishopric of Lebanon and head office of the Armenian Primate of Lebanon.

Bikfaya is home to a commemorative plaque and monumental sculpture, honoring the victims of the 1915 Armenian genocide.  Designed by Zaven Khedeshian and renovated by Hovsep Khacherian in 1993, the outdoor, freestanding sculpture rests on top of a hill that is located on the grounds of the summer retreat of the Catholicate of Cilicia.

The sculpture is a bronze abstract figure of a woman standing with hands open toward the sky.  A plaque with Arabic and Armenian inscriptions reads:&lt;blockquote&gt;''This monument, commemorating the 50th anniversary of the Armenian genocide, was erected with the cooperation of the whole Armenian Community in Lebanon, to celebrate the rebirth of the Armenian nation and to express gratitude to our country, [[Lebanon]] - April 24, 1969''&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''Ustad Awalmir''' ({{lang-ps|'''استاد اولمیر'''}}) (born 1931 in [[Logar Province|Logar]], [[Afghanistan]] – died April 24, 1982 in [[Kabul]], Afghanistan) was an ethnic [[Pashtuns|Pashtun]] [[Afghan]] [[composer]], musician, singer, and [[poet]] who wrote and sang in the [[Pashto language]].

He began learning music as a teen from various music teachers and began to perform for [[radio]] broadcasts. His first song was ''My Heart Has Broken To Pieces''. At the age of 18, he performed at the [[Afghan Independence Day]] in Kabul.

He made a breakthrough into performing on the [[List of radio stations in Afghanistan|Afghan radio station]] with help from [[Malang Jan]], a local poet. Awalmir's output consists of over 250 songs as well as a collection of self-composed songs. His contribution to Afghan music led him the honor of the title [[Ustad]] from the [[Ministry of Information and Culture (Afghanistan)|Ministry of Culture and Information]].

His love and patriotism for Afghanistan is demonstrated in songs such as the famous "Da Zamong Zeba Watan", meaning "this is our beautiful homeland", referring to Afghanistan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.virtualafghans.com/music/awal_mir/watan/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-02-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140203124142/http://www.virtualafghans.com/music/awal_mir/watan/ |archivedate=2014-02-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Aweer''' (also known as the '''Waboni''', '''Boni''' and '''Sanye''') are an ethnic group inhabiting the [[Coast Province]] in southeastern [[Kenya]]. Some members are also found in southern [[Somalia]]. They are indigenous foragers, traditionally subsisting on hunting, gathering, and collecting honey.

==Overview==
Evidence suggests that the Aweer/Boni, along with the related Dahalo and Wata, are remnants of the early [[Bushmen|Bushman]] hunter-gatherer inhabitants of Eastern Africa. According to linguistic, anthropological and other data, these groups later came under the influence and adopted the [[Afro-Asiatic languages]] of the [[Lowland East Cushitic languages|Eastern]] and [[South Cushitic languages|Southern Cushitic]] peoples who moved into the area. [[Dahalo language|Dahalo]] has consequently retained some of the characteristic [[Click consonant|click sounds]] of the [[Khoisan languages|Khoisan]] languages.&lt;ref name="Aminmoll"&gt;{{cite book|last=Mohamed Amin|first=Peter Moll|title=Portraits of Africa|year=1983|publisher=Harvill Press|isbn=0002726394|pages=16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Aweer have historically been known in the literature as ''Boni'' or ''Sanye'', both of which are derogatory terms for low-caste groups.&lt;ref name="Ethnbob"&gt;{{cite web|title=Aweer|url=http://www.ethnologue.com/show_language.asp?code=bob|publisher=Ethnologue|accessdate=10 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Brenzinger"&gt;{{cite book|last=Brenzinger (ed.)|first=Matthias|title=Language Death: Factual and Theoretical Explorations with Special Reference to East Africa|year=1992|publisher=Walter de Gruyter|isbn=3110134047|page=323|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iKHOeLDvUVgC}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their lives were drastically changed when the Kenyan government curtailed their traditional way of life in the 1960s, forcing them to settle in villages along the Hindi-Kiunga Road, between the [[Boni National Reserve]] and the [[Dodori National Reserve]].&lt;ref&gt;(2007, p. 472)&lt;/ref&gt; Although the majority of the Aweer settled in villages located in this corridor between the two reserves, some established themselves in nearby [[Bajuni people|Bajuni]] villages.

Today, the Aweer in Kenya have been encouraged to adopt farming as their main livelihood.&lt;ref name="Ethnbob"/&gt; However, they also continue to engage in many of their traditional hunter-gatherer practices, utilizing the nearby forests for the collection of wild honey, plants for traditional medicine and building materials, and bush meat to supplement their diets. With laws banning the hunting of all wildlife in Kenya, the Aweer's traditional way of life is in danger.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Umar |first=Abdi |title=Traditional Occupations of Indigenous and Tribal Peoples: Emerging Trends |year=2000 |publisher=International Labor Organization |isbn=92-2-112258-1 |pages=44–45 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_84Gg-o5BhYC&amp;pg=PA45&amp;lpg=PA45&amp;dq=aweer+international+labor+office&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=q8mqAgChZT&amp;sig=P5E9Jv83sqcvi_rDzzkbNHpH2iw&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=8Q1BT5ePOcGgtwe54aTBBQ&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0CDoQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |chapter=Herding into the New Millennium: Continuity and Change in the Pastoral Areas of Kenya }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Demographics==
According to the 2009 Kenyan population census, around 7,500 Aweer live in Kenya, where they are an officially recognized group. They have traditionally been concentrated in forests in the [[Coast Province]], particularly the [[Lamu County|Lamu]] and [[Tana River County|Tana River]] districts.&lt;ref name="Ethnbob"/&gt;

Some Aweer also inhabit southern Somalia's [[Badhadhe District|Badhade]] district.&lt;ref name="Prins"&gt;A.H.J. Prins. 1960 Notes on the Boni, a Tribe of Hunters in Northern Kenya.

''The Journal of the Royal Anthropological Institute.'' Vol. 93 (2): 174-85.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Language==
The Aweer speak the [[Aweer language]], also known as Boni. It belongs to the [[Cushitic languages|Cushitic]] branch of the [[Afro-Asiatic languages|Afro-Asiatic]] family.&lt;ref name="Ethnbob"/&gt;

According to ''[[Ethnologue]]'', there are around 8,000 speakers of Aweer/Boni. Most are bilingual and speak the languages of their immediate neighbors, with about 20% speaking only Aweer.&lt;ref name="Ethnbob"/&gt;

Aweer linguistically resembles [[Garre language|Garre]], but the speakers are physically and culturally unalike.&lt;ref name="Frawley"&gt;{{cite book|last=Frawley (ed.)|first=William|title=International Encyclopedia of Linguistics, Volume 1|year=2003|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=0195139771|page=408|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sl_dDVctycgC}}&lt;/ref&gt; The language is believed to be threatened by extinction.&lt;ref name="Brenzinger"/&gt;

==Religion==
The Aweer historically practised a [[Traditional African religion|traditional faith]]. Most have today adopted [[Islam]].&lt;ref name="Ethnbob"/&gt;

The '''Awá''', or '''Guajá''', are an [[indigenous peoples of Brazil|indigenous people]] of [[Brazil]] living in the eastern [[Amazon rainforest]]. There are approximately 350 members, and 100 of them have no contact with the outside world. They are considered highly endangered because of conflicts with [[logging]] interests in their territory.&lt;ref name=observer1&gt;{{cite news| title = 'They're killing us': world's most endangered tribe cries for help| first = Gethin| last = Chamberlain| url = https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/apr/22/brazil-rainforest-awa-endangered-tribe| format = | agency = | newspaper = [[The Observer]]| publisher = [[The Guardian]]| date = 21 April 2012| accessdate = 23 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

They speak [[Guajá language|Guajá]], a [[Tupi–Guaraní]] language. Originally living in settlements, they adopted a nomadic lifestyle around 1800 to escape incursions by Europeans. During the 19th century, they came under increasing attack by settlers in the region, who cleared most of the forests from their land.

From the mid-1980s onward, some Awá moved to government-established settlements. However, for the most part, they were able to maintain their traditional way of life of living entirely off their forests in nomadic groups of a few dozen people, with little or no contact with the outside world.

In 1982, the [[Brazilian government]] received a loan of US$900 million from the [[World Bank]] and the [[European Union]]. One condition of the loan was that the lands of certain indigenous peoples, including the Awá, would be demarcated and protected. That was particularly important for the Awá because their forests were increasingly being invaded by outsiders. There were many cases of tribespeople being killed by settlers, and the forest on which they depend was being destroyed by logging and land clearance for farming.

Without government intervention it seemed very likely that the Awá and their ancient culture would become extinct.

However, the Brazilian government was extraordinarily slow to act on its commitment. It took 20 years of sustained pressure from campaigning organisations such as [[Survival International]] and, earlier, the [[Forest Peoples Programme]] before, in March 2003, the Awá's land was finally demarcated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/2841371.stm |title=Land victory for Amazon Indians |publisher=[[BBC News]] |date=11 March 2003 |accessdate=22 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, encroachment on their land and a series of massacres had reduced their numbers to about 300, only about 60 of whom were still living their traditional [[hunter-gatherer]] way of life.

In late 2011, illegal loggers burned an 8-year-old Awá girl alive after she wandered out of her village.&lt;ref name=telegraph/&gt; The murder happened inside a protected area in the state of Maranhão.&lt;ref name=telegraph&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/southamerica/brazil/9005835/Loggers-burned-Amazon-tribe-girl-alive.html |title=Loggers 'burned Amazon tribe girl alive' |last=Sanchez |first=Raf |publisher=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |date=10 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Luis Carlos Guajajaras, a leader from another people, said that the girl had been killed as a warning to other native peoples living in the protected area.&lt;ref name=telegraph/&gt;

According to the Indigenous Missionary Council about 450 indigenous people were murdered between 2003 and 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/blogpost/post/amazon-girl-burned-alive-by-loggers-one-story-among-hundreds-of-unreported-deaths/2012/01/12/gIQAnbWatP_blog.html |title=Amazon girl burned alive by loggers: one story among hundreds of unreported deaths |last=Flock |first=Elizabeth |publisher=[[The Washington Post]] |date=12 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; An investigation discovered the Awá camp in question had been destroyed by loggers.&lt;ref name=observer1/&gt; 

According to Survival International, a human rights organization which campaigns for the rights of indigenous tribal peoples and considers them to be the "earth's most threatened tribe," Awá forests are now disappearing faster than in any other Indian area in the [[Brazilian Amazon]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2777">'''Babels''' is an international network of volunteer [[Interpreting|interpreters]] and [[translators]] that was born out of the [[European Social Forum]] (ESF) process and whose main objective is to cover the interpreting needs of the various [[Social Forums]]. It is a horizontal, non-hierarchical network, with no permanent structures of any kind.

[[Image:Babels headsets.jpg|thumb|right|Headsets for instantaneous translation at London ESF]]Babels originated in the process of preparation for the [[European Social Forum#First ESF|2002 ESF]], a [[left-wing]] conference of the [[anti-globalization movement]] held in [[Florence]]. A small network of 'communication activists' associated with [[ATTAC]] France proposed that the conference use only volunteers to interpret the various languages of the speakers for the audience. There was some debate about the quality of volunteer translators but the cost of professionals helped sway the argument. A last-minute call went out for volunteers to which 600 people responded and which finally resulted in around 350 volunteer interpreters and translators for the Forum. The group had no official space to work from and little funds so had to squat a [[medieval]] tower.

After the first ESF the organisers of the translation formed Babels groups in [[France]] and [[Italy]] and groups also sprang up in [[Germany]], the [[United Kingdom|UK]], and [[Spain]].These groups went on to participate in counter [[G8]] conferences in [[Evian]] and [[Annemasse]].

For the [[European Social Forum#Second ESF|second ESF]] in Paris organisers gave Babels £200,000 funding, offices facilities and a longer preparation period. Over 1000 Babelistas (Babels translation volunteers) took part in the translation.

The Babels organisation went on to provide translation for the ESF's global partner the [[World Social Forum]] (WSF) in Mumbai and the first Social Forum of the Americas in Ecuador and the [[European Social Forum#Third ESF|third ESF]] in London.

Babels describes itself as "''not a provider of linguistic services''" but rather "''a political actor''"[http://www.babels.org/a4.html] and will not work on any project unless it has been involved in contributing to the definition of the project with its ideas and demands.

[[File:Wedding procession of Muhammad Quli Qutub Shah.jpg|thumb|300px|Wedding procession of Muhammad Quli Qutb Shah with Bhagmati.]]
'''Bhagamati''' was a mystic Hindu queen of Muslim sultan [[Muhammad Quli Qutb Shah]]. Qutb Shah was the fifth sultan of the erstwhile [[Qutb Shahi Dynasty]] who ruled over the [[Golkonda]] region of [[South India]] in the 16th century.&lt;ref name="toi"&gt;http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2010-03-22/hyderabad/28143491_1_bhagmati-quli-qutb-shah-hyderabad&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.deccanchronicle.com/140429/nation-current-affairs/article/name-game&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Bhagmati was born in Chichlam (around [[Yakutpura]]) in a [[Hindu]] family.

==Death==
Bhagmati died in 1611 CE. No tomb was built over her last remains.&lt;ref&gt;http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/Bhagmatis-tomb-No-proof-to-nail-it/articleshow/12511808.cms&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, courtesans Taramati and Premamati lie buried at [[Qutb Shahi Tombs]]. Ziauddin Ahmed Shakeb, an expert on Indian and Islamic art, cites the Peshwa (prime minister) of Mohammed Quli as responsible for obscuring Bhagmati's character from the view of history.&lt;ref name="toi"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

The Bhao, sometimes called Bhau is a [[Rajput]] clan, found in [[Punjab (Pakistan)|Punjab]], [[Pakistan]] as well as both Indian administered [[Jammu &amp; Kashmir]] as well as [[Azad Kashmir]].

== History and origins ==

According to the tribe's tradition,they are Raghubansi
[[Rajputs]], originally from [[Ayodhya]] in [[North India]] yet the [[Dogra]] claim the Bhaos to be of the [[Dogra]] race. Their traditions say that about a thousand years ago, they immigrated to [[Jammu]], where they settled near [[Akhnur]] on the banks of the [[Chenab]] river. In the 14th Century, small groups began to move into what is now [[Gujrat District]] in [[Pakistan]]. At the time of their settlement in Gujrat, they also started to convert to [[Islam]].

The name Bhao is said to mean those who inspire fear in the local [[Dogri]] language, which is spoken in [[Jammu]]. According to tribal legends, when the tribe settled in Jammu, it inspired fear among its enemies.

== Distribution ==

The Muslim branch of the Bhao are found in the [[Kharian Tehsil]] of [[Gujrat District]], as well as a few villages in the [[Bhimber District]] of Azad Kashmir. The [[Hindu]] branch is still found in [[Akhnur]] in [[Jammu District]]. Historically, Muslim Bhao were also found in [[Gurdaspur District]], but all these Bhao Rajput emigrated to [[Pakistan]] at the time of the [[partition of India]].

'''Broken Slavey''' (also ''Broken Slavé, Broken Slave, Slavey Jargon, Broken Slavee,'' and ''le Jargon esclave'') was a [[trade language]] used between Native Americans and whites in the [[Yukon]] area (for example, in around [[Liard River]] and in the [[Mackenzie River]] district) in the 19th century.

Broken Slavey is based primarily on the [[Slavey language]] with elements from [[French language|French]], [[Cree language|Cree]], and perhaps to a lesser extent [[English language|English]]. However, there is some disagreement among sources: Petitot (1889) states that it lacks English, [[Dene Suline language|Dene Suline]] (Chipewyan), or [[Gwich'in language|Gwich'in]] (Kutchin) elements in contrast to the neighbouring '''Loucheux Pidgin''' (or [[Loucheux]] Jargon), while Dall (1870) states that it includes English elements and McClellan (1981) states that it contained Dene Suline influences. Later sources have ignored the earlier accounts and assumed that "Broken Slavey" is merely French vocabulary ([[loanword]]s) used in northern [[Athabascan languages]]. [[Michael E. Krauss|Michael Krauss]] has suggested that French loanwords in Athabascan languages may have been borrowed via Broken Slavey.

A further difference among sources is that Petitot distinguishes the Broken Slavey trade language spoken along the Mackenzie River from a different trade language called Loucheux Pidgin that was spoken along the [[Peel River (Canada)|Peel]] (a [[tributary]] of the Mackenzie) and [[Yukon River|Yukon]] rivers. Other contemporary sources as well as later sources do not make a distinction between Broken Slavey and Loucheux Pidgin, which may explain their inclusion of English, Dene Suline, and Gwich'in as influences on Broken Slavey.

The native languages of speakers who used Broken Slavey (known in Alaska as 'Slavey') were Dene Suline, French, Gwich'in, [[Inuit language|Inuktitut]], Slavey. One notable speaker of Slavey Jargon was Antoine Hoole, the Hudson's Bay Company translator at Fort Yukon.  Hoole (or Houle) was a professional servant of the Company who served for well over twenty years at Peel River and at Fort Yukon.

Having a French-speaking father and a Métis mother, Hoole was born in 1827 and raised in a household where at least two languages were spoken.  He originally came from Fort Halkett on the Liard River in what is now the southern Yukon Territory.  He probably spoke South Slavey because that was the Native American language spoken around the Liard River, although Sekani and Kaska people also frequented the area.  Hoole died in Fort Yukon at the age of forty-one, on October 22, 1868.  The Gwich'in apparently stopped speaking the jargon in the early 20th century.  The gold rush, with its massive influx of English speakers into the region beginning in 1886, probably provided a death blow.  One speaker, Malcolm Sandy Roberts of Circle, Alaska, continued to use it in a diminished form until his death in 1983.&lt;ref&gt;Mishler, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

The best written historical documentation of Slavey Jargon shows its actual use was for preaching the gospel and for teasing and harassing clergymen, and for interpersonal relationships.  For all these reasons, it seems inaccurate to characterize it strictly as a trade jargon.

Broken Slavey has recently been documented with a few vocabulary items and phrases (collected in Petitot's work) and only a little of its grammar and lexicon. However, more information may yet be discovered in archives through missionary records and traders' journals.

{{See also|World population}}
'''[[Demographics]] of the [[world]]''' include [[population density]], [[Ethnic group|ethnicity]], education level, health measures, economic status, religious affiliations and other aspects of the human population of the planet [[Earth]]. 

The overall total population of the world is approximately 7.5 billion, as of March 2018. 

Its overall population density is 50 people per km² (129.28 per sq. mile), excluding Antarctica. Nearly two-thirds of the population lives in [[Asia]] and is predominantly urban and suburban, with more than 2.5 billion in the countries of [[China]] and [[India]] combined. The world's fairly low [[literacy]] rate (83.7%) is attributable to [[poverty]]. Lower literacy rates are common in [[South Asia]], [[West Asia]], and [[Sub-Saharan Africa]].

The world's largest ethnic group is [[Han Chinese]] with [[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin]] being the world's most spoken language in terms of native speakers.

Human migration has been shifting toward cities and urban centers, with the urban population jumping from 29% in 1950, to 50.5% in 2005.&lt;ref name="cia world"&gt;[https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/xx.html CIA.gov World Factbook - World Statistics] {{webarchive |url=https://www.webcitation.org/5nDzbMmsd?url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/xx.html |date=1 February 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Working backwards from the United Nations prediction that the world will be 51.3 percent urban by 2010, Dr. Ron Wimberley, Dr. Libby Morris and Dr. Gregory Fulkerson estimated 23 May 2007 to be the first time the urban population outnumbered the rural population in history.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gizmag.com/go/7334/ World Population Becomes More Urban That Rural]&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Historical migration of human populations begins with the movement of ''[[Homo erectus]]'' out of Africa across [[Eurasia]] about a million years ago. ''[[Human|Homo sapiens]]'' appear to have occupied all of Africa about 150,000 years ago, moved out of Africa 50,000 - 60,000 years ago, and had spread across [[Prehistory of Australia|Australia]], [[History of Asia|Asia]] and [[Paleolithic Europe|Europe]] by 30,000 years BC. [[Models of migration to the New World|Migration to the Americas]] took place 20,000 to 15,000 years ago, and by 2,000 years ago, most of the [[Pacific Islands]] were colonized.

Until c.&amp;nbsp;10,000 years ago, humans lived as [[hunter-gatherer]]s. They generally lived in small nomadic groups known as [[band societies]]. The advent of agriculture prompted the [[Neolithic Revolution]], when access to food surplus led to the formation of permanent [[human settlement]]s. About 6,000 years ago, the first proto-states developed in [[Mesopotamia]], [[Egypt]]'s [[Nile Valley]] and the [[Indus Valley Civilization|Indus Valley]]. Early human settlements were dependent on proximity to [[water resources|water]] and, depending on the [[lifestyle (sociology)|lifestyle]], other [[natural resources]] used for [[subsistence]]. But humans have a great capacity for altering their [[habitat (ecology)|habitats]] by means of technology.

Since 1800, the [[human population]] has increased from one billion&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/411162.stm | accessdate = 5 February 2008 | work=BBC News | title=World's population reaches six billion | date=5 August 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; to over seven billion,&lt;ref name=7billpop&gt;{{cite web|title=UN population estimates.|url=http://esa.un.org/unpd/wpp/unpp/p2k0data.asp|work=Population Division, United Nations|accessdate=4 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004, some 2.5 billion out of 6.3 billion people (39.7%) lived in [[urban area]]s.

==Cities==
The World has hundreds of major cities spread across 6 continents. Most are in coastal regions.

{{As of|2005}}, the World had 62 metropolitan areas with a population of over 3,000,000 people each.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mongabay.com/igapo/2005_world_city_populations/2005_city_population_01.html 2005 World City Populations]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[world's population]] is 7 billion&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.census.gov/main/www/popclock.html U.S. &amp; World Population Clocks]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Earth]]'s total area (including land and water) is 510 million square kilometers (197 million square miles).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/xx.html CIA - The World Factbook] {{webarchive |url=https://www.webcitation.org/5nDzbMmsd?url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/xx.html |date=1 February 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, the worldwide human population density is 7 billion ÷ 510 million = 13.7 per km² (35.5 per sq. mile). If only the Earth's land area of 150 million km² (58 million sq. miles) is taken into account, then human population density increases to 46.7 per km² (117.2 per sq. mile). This calculation includes all continental and island land area, including [[Antarctica]]. If Antarctica is also excluded, then population density rises to 50 people per km² (129.28 per sq. mile).&lt;ref name=about&gt;[http://geography.about.com/od/populationgeography/a/popdensity.htm About.com]&lt;/ref&gt; Considering that over half of the Earth's land mass consists of areas inhospitable to human inhabitation, such as deserts and high mountains, and that population tends to cluster around seaports and fresh water sources, this number by itself does not give any meaningful measurement of human population density.

Several of the most densely populated territories in the world are [[city-states]], [[microstates]] or [[Dependent territory|dependencies]].&lt;ref name=unpop&gt;{{cite journal | url=https://www.un.org/esa/population/publications/wpp2008/wpp2008_text_tables.pdf | title=World Population Prospects, Table A.1| version=2008 revision  | format=PDF | publisher=United Nations | author=Department of Economic and Social Affairs Population Division | year=2009 | accessdate= 12 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Monaco government uses a smaller surface area figure resulting in a population density of 18,078 per km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; These territories share a relatively small area and a high [[urbanization]] level, with an economically specialized [[city]] population drawing also on rural resources outside the area, illustrating the difference between high population density and [[Human overpopulation|overpopulation]].

{{Further information|List of religious populations}}

The table below lists religions classified by philosophy; however, religious philosophy is not always the determining factor in local practice. Please note that this table includes heterodox movements as adherents to their larger philosophical category, although this may be disputed by others within that category. For example, [[Cao Đài]] is listed because it claims to be a separate category from Buddhism, while [[Hòa Hảo]] is not, even though they are similar [[new religious movement]]s.

The population numbers below are computed by a combination of census reports, random surveys (in countries where religion data is not collected in census, for example United States or France), and self-reported attendance numbers, but results can vary widely depending on the way questions are phrased, the definitions of religion used and the bias of the agencies or organizations conducting the survey. Informal or unorganized religions are especially difficult to count. Some organizations may wildly inflate their numbers.

Since the late 19th century, the demographics of religion have changed a great deal. Some [[Western civilization|countries with a historically large Christian population]] have experienced a significant decline in the numbers of professed active Christians: see [[demographics of atheism]]. Symptoms of the decline in active participation in Christian religious life include declining recruitment for the [[priest]]hood and [[monastery|monastic life]], as well as diminishing attendance at [[Church service|church]].  On the other hand, since the 19th century, large areas of [[sub-Saharan Africa]] have been converted to Christianity, and this area of the world has the highest population growth rate.  In the realm of [[Western civilization]], there has been an increase in the number of people who identify themselves as [[secular humanism|secular humanists]]. In many countries, such as the People's Republic of China, communist governments have discouraged religion, making it difficult to count the actual number of believers. However, after the collapse of communism in numerous countries of Eastern Europe and the former [[Soviet Union]], religious life has been experiencing resurgence there, both in the form of traditional [[Eastern Christianity]] and in the forms of [[Neopaganism]] and [[Far Eastern religions]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}

The actual annual growth in the number of humans fell from its peak of 88.0 million in 1989, to a low of 73.9 million in 2003, after which it rose again to 75.2 million in 2006. Since then, annual growth has declined. In 2009, the human population increased by 74.6 million, which is projected to fall steadily to about 41 million per annum in 2050, at which time the population will have increased to about 9.2 billion.&lt;ref name="census1"/&gt; Each region of the globe has seen great reductions in growth rate in recent decades, though growth rates remain above 2% in some countries of the [[Middle East]] and [[Sub-Saharan Africa]], and also in [[South Asia]], [[Southeast Asia]], and [[Latin America]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.census.gov/ipc/www/idb/worldpop.php U.S. Census Bureau, June 2009] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090701122431/http://www.census.gov/ipc/www/idb/worldpop.php |date=1 July 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some countries experienced [[Population decline|negative population growth]], especially in [[Eastern Europe]] mainly due to low [[fertility rate]]s, high death rates and [[emigration]]. In [[Southern Africa]], growth is slowing due to the high number of [[HIV]]-related deaths. Some [[Western Europe]] countries might also encounter negative population growth.&lt;ref&gt;[http://esa.un.org/unpp/index.asp?panel=2 UN population projections]  {{webarchive|url=https://www.webcitation.org/5tpNJ6FqS?url=http://esa.un.org/unpp/index.asp?panel=2 |date=28 October 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Japan]]'s population began decreasing in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/jan/02/japan-population |title=Japan sees biggest population fall |work=The Guardian |date= |accessdate=6 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Population in the world increased from 1990 to 2008 with 1,423 million and 27% growth. Measured by persons, the increase was highest in [[India]] (290 million) and [[China]] (192 million).

According to the [[The World Factbook|CIA - The World Factbook]], the country with the highest birth rate currently is Niger at 51.26 births per 1000 people. The country with the lowest birth rate is Japan at 7.64 births per 1000 people. Hong Kong, a Special Administrative Region of China, is at 7.42 births per 1000 people. As compared to the 1950s, birth rate was at 36 births per 1000 in the 1950s,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uneca.org/eca_programmes/food_security_and_sustainability/programme_overview/population/fertility/crude_world.htm Uneca.org: Crude Birth Rates - The World and its Major Regions, 1950-2050] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110816073652/http://www.uneca.org/eca_programmes/food_security_and_sustainability/programme_overview/population/fertility/crude_world.htm |date=16 August 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; birth rate has declined by 16 births per 1000 people. In July 2011, the U.S. National Institutes of Health announced that the adolescent birth rate continues to decline.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nih.gov/news/health/jul2011/nichd-07.htm Federal report shows drop in adolescent birth rate, July 7, 2011 News Release - National Institutes of Health (NIH)]&lt;/ref&gt; 

Birth rates vary even within the same geographic areas. In Europe, as of July 2011, Ireland's birth rate is 16.5 per cent, which is 3.5 per cent higher than the next-ranked country, the UK. France has a birth rate of 12.8 per cent while Sweden is at 12.3 per cent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thejournal.ie/ireland-has-one-of-highest-birth-and-lowest-death-rates-in-eu-189080-Jul2011/ |title=Ireland has one of highest birth and lowest death rates in EU |work=Thejournal.ie |date=29 July 2011 |accessdate=6 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2011, the UK's Office for National Statistics (ONS) announced a 2.4% increase in live births in the UK in 2010 alone.&lt;ref name="guardian1"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/society/2011/jul/13/more-midwives-birth-rate-40-year-high |title=Call for more midwives as birth rate reaches 40-year high |work=The Guardian |date=13 July 2011 |accessdate=6 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is the highest birth rate in the UK in 40 years.&lt;ref name="guardian1"/&gt; By contrast, the birth rate in Germany is only 8.3 per 1,000, which is so low that both the UK and France, which have significantly smaller populations, produced more births in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/health/2011/0809/1224302081071.html |title=Germany faces up to its kinder surprise |work=The Irish Times |date=9 June 2018 |accessdate=6 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Birth rates also vary within the same geographic area, based on different demographic groups. For example, in April 2011, the U.S. CDC announced that the birth rate for women over the age of 40 in the U.S. rose between 2007 and 2009, while it fell among every other age group during the same time span.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cnn.com/2011/HEALTH/04/01/cdc.births.decline/index.html |title=CDC records rise in birth rate for women over 40 |work=CNN.com |date= |accessdate=6 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2011, Taiwan's government announced that its birth rate declined in the previous year, despite the fact that it implemented a host of approaches to encourage its citizens to have babies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-pacific-14525525 |title=Taiwanese birth rate plummets despite measures |work=BBC News |date= |accessdate=6 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Birth rates ranging from 10-20 births per 1000 are considered low, while rates from 40-50 births per 1000 are considered high. There are problems associated with both an extremely high birth rate and an extremely low birth rate. High birth rates can cause stress on the government welfare and family programs to support a youthful population. Additional problems faced by a country with a high birth rate include educating a growing number of children, creating jobs for these children when they enter the workforce, and dealing with the environmental effects that a large population can produce. Low birth rates can put stress on the government to provide adequate senior welfare systems and also the stress on families to support the elders themselves. There will be less children or working age population to support the constantly growing aging population.

According to the [[World Health Organization]], the 10 leading [[causes of death]] in 2002 were:
&lt;!-- ref: http://www.who.int/entity/whr/2004/annex/topic/en/annex_2_en.pdf --&gt;
# 12.6% [[Ischemic heart disease]]
#  9.7% [[Cerebrovascular disease]]
#  6.8% [[Lower respiratory infection]]s
#  4.9% [[HIV/AIDS]]
#  4.8% [[Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease]]
#  3.2% [[Diarrhoeal disease]]s
#  2.7% [[Tuberculosis]]
#  2.2% [[Trachea/bronchus/lung cancers]]
#  2.2% [[Malaria]]
#  2.1% [[Road traffic accidents]]

Causes of death vary greatly between first and third world countries.

According to [[Jean Ziegler]] (the [[United Nations]] Special Rapporteur on the Right to Food for 2000 to March 2008), mortality due to [[malnutrition]] accounted for 58% of the total mortality in 2006: "In the world, approximately 62 millions people, all causes of death combined, die each year. In 2006, more than 36 millions died of hunger or diseases due to deficiencies in [[micronutrients]]".&lt;ref name=Ziegler&gt;[[Jean Ziegler]], ''[[L'Empire de la honte]]'', Fayard, 2007 {{ISBN|978-2-253-12115-2}}, p.130.&lt;/ref&gt;

Of the roughly 150,000 people who died each day across the globe, about two thirds—100,000 per day—died of age-related causes in 2001, according to an article which counts all deaths "due to causes that kill hardly anyone under the age of 40" as age-related.&lt;ref name="doi10.2202/1941-6008.1011"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Aubrey D.N.J | first = de Grey | authorlink = Aubrey de Grey | title = Life Span Extension Research and Public Debate: Societal Considerations | journal = Studies in Ethics, Law, and Technology | volume = 1 | issue = 1, Article 5 | year = 2007 | url = http://www.sens.org/files/pdf/ENHANCE-PP.pdf | format = PDF | doi = 10.2202/1941-6008.1011 | accessdate = 7 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{bettersource|| reference uses an extremely broad definition of "age-related" deaths, including even traffic accidents due to poor eyesight|date=June 2018}} In industrialized nations, the proportion was even higher according to that article, reaching 90%.&lt;ref name="doi10.2202/1941-6008.1011"/&gt;

Countries on the [[Arabian Peninsula]] tend to have a 'natural' ratio of about 1.05 at birth but a very high ratio of males for those over 65 ([[Saudi Arabia]] 1.13, [[United Arab Emirates]] 2.73, [[Qatar]] 2.84), indicating either an above-average mortality rate for females or a below-average mortality for males, or, more likely in this case, a large population of aging male [[foreign worker|guest workers]]. Conversely, countries of [[Eastern Europe]] (the [[Baltic states]], [[Belarus]], [[Ukraine]], [[Russia]]) tend to have a 'normal' ratio at birth but a very low ratio of males among those over 65 (Russia 0.46, Latvia 0.48, Ukraine 0.52); similarly, [[Armenia]] has a far above average male ratio at birth (1.17), and a below-average male ratio above 65 (0.67). This effect may be caused by [[human migration|emigration]] and higher male mortality as result of higher post-Soviet era deaths; it may also be related to the enormous (by western standards) rate of alcoholism in the former Soviet states. Another possible contributory factor is an aging population, with a higher than normal proportion of relatively elderly people: we recall that due to higher differential mortality rates the ratio of males to females reduces for each year of age.

There is an inverse correlation between [[income and fertility]], wherein [[Developed country|developed countries]] usually have a much lower [[fertility rate]]. Various [[fertility factor (demography)|fertility factors]] may be involved, such as education and urbanization. [[Mortality rate]]s are low, [[birth control]] is understood and easily accessible, and costs are often deemed very high because of education, clothing, feeding, and social amenities. With wealth, contraception becomes affordable.  However, in countries like Iran where contraception was made artificially affordable before the economy accelerated, birth rate also rapidly declined.  Further, longer periods of time spent getting higher education often mean women have children later in life. Female labor participation rate also has substantial negative impact on fertility. However, this effect is neutralized among Nordic or liberalist countries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://homepage3.nifty.com/sociology/motion.html Graph Charts of TFR and FLR using Google Motion Chart using World Bank's World Development Index.]&lt;/ref&gt;{{elucidate|date=November 2012}}

In [[undeveloped countries]] on the other hand, families desire children for their labour and as caregivers for their parents in old age. Fertility rates are also higher due to the lack of access to [[contraceptives]], generally lower levels of [[female education]], and lower rates of female employment in industry.

===Unemployment rate===
8.7% (2010 est.)
8.2% (2009 est.)
note: 30% combined unemployment and underemployment in many non-industrialized countries; developed countries typically 4%-12% unemployment (2007 est.)

===Demonym===
The [[demonym]] for Earth's inhabitants is [[wikt:Earthling|Earthling]] or, as either a noun or an adjective, [[wikt:Terran|Terran]].

{{Main article|Language family}}

Worldwide, [[English language|English]] is used widely as a [[lingua franca]] and can be seen to be the dominant language at this time. The world's largest language by native speakers is [[Mandarin Chinese]] which is a [[first language]] of around 960 million people, or 12.44% of the population, predominantly in [[Greater China]]. [[Spanish language|Spanish]] is spoken by around 330 to 400 million people, predominantly in the [[Americas]] and [[Spain]]. [[Arabic language|Arabic]] is spoken by around 280 million people. [[Hindi]] is spoken by about 200 million speakers, mostly in [[India]]. [[Bengali language|Bengali]] is spoken by around 230 million people, predominantly in India and Bangladesh. [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] is spoken by about 230 million speakers in [[Portugal]], [[Brazil]], [[East Timor]], and [[Southern Africa]].

There are numerous other languages, grouped into nine major families:

# [[Indo-European languages]] 46% ([[Europe]], [[Western Asia]], [[South Asia]], [[North Asia]], [[North America]], [[South America]], and [[Oceania]])
# [[Sino-Tibetan languages]] 21% ([[East Asia]])
# [[Niger–Congo languages]] 6.4% ([[Sub-Saharan Africa]])
# [[Afro-Asiatic languages]] 6.0% ([[North Africa]] to [[Horn of Africa]], and [[Western Asia]])
# [[Austronesian languages]] 5.9% ([[Oceania]], [[Madagascar]], and [[Maritime Southeast Asia]])
# [[Dravidian languages]] 3.7% ([[South Asia]])
# [[Altaic languages]] (controversial combination of Turkic, Mongolic, and Tungusic families) 2.3% ([[Central Asia]], [[North Asia]] ([[Siberia]]), and [[Anatolia]])&lt;ref&gt;Since the Mongolic and Tungusic language families have only a relatively small number of speakers, the majority of the Altaic percentage represents speakers of Turkic languages&lt;/ref&gt;
# [[Austroasiatic languages]] 1.7% ([[Indochina|Mainland Southeast Asia]])
# [[Tai–Kadai languages]] 1.3% ([[Southeast Asia]])

'''European Business Summit''' (EBS) is an events and conference organiser, and the creator of one of the largest networking and debating events in Brussels – the annual European Business Summit.

==About EBS==

EBS was founded in 2000 by the FEB ([[Federation of Enterprises in Belgium]]), and later joined in support by BUSINESS EUROPE. From the beginning it's purpose was to bring together policy-makers and [[business leader]]s to discuss contemporary issues affecting the future of Europe, thus helping to [[advocacy|improve the decision-making process]] on the EU-level.

EBS also organises the “Back from Davos” event, whose purpose is to follow up on the conclusions and achievements of the annual meetings of the [[World Economic Forum]] in Davos, Switzerland. The 2018 edition took place on January 30 in Brussels. It took a form of a conversation with [[Jyrki Katainen]] - EU Commissioner Jobs, Growth, Investment and Competitiveness and Daniela Vincenti, Editor-in-Chief at [[EurActiv]].

Moreover, EBS supports events such as Think Digital, EU Energy Summit and the European Defence Industry Summit.

When organising its events EBS works with companies, associations, governments and regional representatives, NGOs, academia and think tanks from across multiple sectors.

==Honorary board==

The Honorary Board of the European Business Summit consists of a number of esteemed figures with significant achievements in the areas of politics and business.  Members of the Board include a former Italian Prime Minister [[Mario Monti]], the President of [[BusinessEurope]] Emma Marcegaglia and the CEO of the Solvay Group [[Jean-Pierre Clamadieu]] among others.

==Partnerships and patronage==

EBS, under the provision of the Belgian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, is supported by the FEB (Federation of Enterprises in Belgium) and BusinessEurope. EBS also operates under the high patronage of His Majesty the King of the Belgians.

==Annual European Business Summit==

The European Business Summit (EBS) is the EBS’ annual flagship event organised in Brussels. Each year the Summit attracts more than 2,000 participants and 200 high-level speakers from over 60 countries. Previous guests and speakers include heads of state and government, European ministers, EU Commissioners, high-ranking individuals, civil society, and academia. Since 2014 the Summit has been organized in the Egmont Palace in Brussels, Belgium.

The Summit spans 2 days, beginning with an Opening Plenary, followed by numerous sessions dedicated to specific topics correlating with key negotiations taking place at the EU-level in a particular year. The sessions take different forms, from big roundtable discussions for around 200 participants, featuring EU Commissioners and high-level officials as speakers, to Agora discussions for around 100 participants, to more intimate “Meet the Expert sessions” which give the opportunity for the audience to interact with the speakers. The Summit concludes with a Closing Plenary session featuring a distinguished guest speaker. The event is complemented by networking lunches and evening gatherings during which all guests have the chance to exchange views and search for new opportunities for collaboration.

==EBS 2017==

The 2017 edition of EBS took place on May 22–23, 2017 and welcomed a wide range of high-level speakers for key moments including Minister Wolfgang Schäuble who spoke about Europe in a new world, CEO Jean-Pierre Clamadieu on [[Sustainable Development Goals]], former Prime Minister Mario Monti on the future of the [[European economy]], MEP Guy Verhofstadt on the future of Europe, and 10 EU Commissioners speaking on creating a new narrative for Europe.

==EBS 2018==

The 2018 edition of the Summit took place on May 23–24 in the Egmont Palace in Brussels. The theme of this edition was “Leading in a changing world: Europe at the forefront of global [[economic change|economic]], social and political change”. The discussions focused on topics such as [[clean industry]], ethics, trade, security and [[defence industry|defence]], [[digitalisation]], [[energy industry|energy]] and [[Brexit]],

==Media==

Every year the Summit attracts significant media attention, with over 250 journalists from international and European media outlets attending the event. EBS offers media partners exclusive access to high-level speakers, private interview rooms and assistance in scheduling one-on-one meetings.

==Migration history==
Filipinos first arrived in Saudi Arabia in 1973, when a group of Filipino engineers migrated to the country.&lt;ref name="mofa"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mofa.gov.sa/Detail.asp?InSectionID=3057&amp;InNewsItemID=37460|title=Ambassador of Saudi Arabia to the Philippines|last=Wali|first=Mohammed Ameen |publisher=Mofa.gov.sa|accessdate=2009-01-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today, staff at the Saudi Arabian embassy in the Philippines process between 800 and 900 jobs for Filipinos daily.&lt;ref name="BM"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://businessmirror.com.ph/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=5017:saudi-arabia-will-still-need-rp-medical-professionals-&amp;catid=33:economy&amp;Itemid=60|title=Saudi Arabia will still need RP medical professionals|last=Torres|first=Estrella|date=2009-01-22|publisher=Business Mirror|accessdate=2009-01-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, Saudi Arabia had 300,000 job orders for Filipinos.&lt;ref name="ST"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.manilatimes.net/national/2008/apr/06/yehey/ofw/20080406ofw1.html |title=More workers needed for the Middle East |last=Martin |first=Sammy |date=2008-04-06 |publisher=Sunday Times |accessdate=2009-01-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081017134015/http://www.manilatimes.net/national/2008/apr/06/yehey/ofw/20080406ofw1.html |archivedate=October 17, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, in the first time hiring Filipino medical professionals, Saudi Arabia announced intentions to hire 6,000 Filipinos as doctors and nurses between 2009 and 2011.&lt;ref name="BM"/&gt; In addition to medical professionals, Filipinos work as automotive workers,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dole.gov.ph/news/details.asp?id=N000001123|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304023159/http://www.dole.gov.ph/news/details.asp?id=N000001123|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2016-03-04|title=POLO mediation improves conditions of 15 Filipino car workers in Saudi Arabia|date=2004-11-11|publisher=[[Department of Labor and Employment (Philippines)|DOLE]] News|accessdate=2009-01-24}} &lt;/ref&gt; construction workers,&lt;ref name="job"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dole.gov.ph/news/details.asp?id=N000000763|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303172012/http://www.dole.gov.ph/news/details.asp?id=N000000763|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2016-03-03|title=Deployment of OFWs seen to increase this year -Imson|date=2004-06-22|publisher=[[Department of Labor and Employment (Philippines)|DOLE]] News|accessdate=2009-01-24}} &lt;/ref&gt; and engineers,&lt;ref name="mofa"/&gt; as well as in the fields of [[desalination]],&lt;ref name="job"/&gt; petroleum production and processing,&lt;ref name="job"/&gt; telecommunications,&lt;ref name="job"/&gt; and transportation.&lt;ref name="job"/&gt;

==Labor issues==
Every year, an unknown number of Filipinos in Saudi Arabia are "victims of sexual abuses, maltreatment, unpaid salaries, and other labor malpractices," because of [[Roman Catholic Church|Religion]] according to John Leonard Monterona, the Middle East coordinator of Migrante, a [[Manila]]-based OFW organization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://qa.filipinoexpats.com/node/940 |title=OFW rights violation worsens under the Arroyo administration |last=Leonard |first=John |date=2008-07-03 |publisher=Filipino OFWs Qatar |accessdate=2009-01-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090107061353/http://qa.filipinoexpats.com/node/940 |archivedate=2009-01-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some Filipinos are attracted and [[Human trafficking in Saudi Arabia|transported to Saudi Arabia illegally]], where they are left stranded without work.&lt;ref name="bulatlat"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://bulatlat.com/main/2008/10/25/middle-east-is-%E2%80%98most-distressing-ofw-destination%E2%80%99-migrant-group/|title=Middle East is ‘Most Distressing OFW Destination’ - Migrant Group|last=Olea|first=Ronalyn|date=2008-10-25|publisher=Bulatlat News|accessdate=2009-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Between January and August 2008, approximately 800 throughout the country sought help at Migrante chapters,&lt;ref name="bulatlat"/&gt; and 922 others were deported to the Philippines in the first three months of 2008 after overstaying their visa requirements.&lt;ref name="aubrey"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.bulatlat.com/2008/02/191-ofws-still-stranded-jeddah-says-migrante-saudi |title=191 OFWs Still Stranded in Jeddah, Says Migrante-Saudi |last=Makilan |first=Aubrey S.

==Education==
{{seealso|Template:Philippine international schools}}
As of February 2006 about 75% of the Philippine international schools represented by the [[Commission on Filipinos Overseas]] (CFO) were located in Saudi Arabia. Community-owned Philippine schools, including the [[International Philippine School in Al Khobar]] (IPSA), the [[International Philippine School in Jeddah]] (IPSJ), and [[International Philippine School in Riyadh]] (IPSR), were by 2006 managed by independent school boards but were initially managed by the diplomatic missions themselves.&lt;ref name=RegisGuzmanp177&gt;Regis, Czarina Valerie A. and Allan B. de Guzman.

July 2006, Volume 5, Issue 2, pp 175-183. Published online on September 9, 2006. CITED: p. 180.&lt;/ref&gt;

Large numbers of Philippine children came to Saudi after many Filipino workers arrived in Saudi Arabia in the 1980s. The first Philippine school in Saudi Arabia, [[Philippine School in Jeddah]] was established after the Philippine Consulate in Jeddah began making efforts to start a school in 1983, and Philippine schools were later established in [[Riyadh]] and other Saudi cities. In 2000 Saudi Arabia had nine accredited Philippine schools.&lt;ref name=RegisGuzmanp177/&gt; By 2005 Jeddah alone had four Philippine international schools, with two more scheduled to open shortly.&lt;ref name=Salud&gt;Salud, Francis R. "[http://www.arabnews.com/node/263863 2 More Filipino Schools to Open in Jeddah]" ({{webarchive |url=https://www.webcitation.org/6co2xNDp0?url=http://www.arabnews.com/node/263863 |date=2015-11-05 }}). ''[[Arab News]]''. Thursday 7 March 2005. Retrieved on 5 November 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; By 2006 there were 21 Philippine schools recognized by the CFO, reflecting a 133% growth rate from 2000.&lt;ref name=RegisGuzmanp177/&gt;

Community international schools in Saudi Arabia are not required to separate male and female students into separate campuses and are allowed to host social activities with men and women mixed.&lt;ref name=RegisGuzmanp178&gt;Regis, Czarina Valerie A. and Allan B. de Guzman.

CITED: p. 178.&lt;/ref&gt; Regis and Guzman stated that in private Philippine international schools, unlike in the community schools, many Saudi rules that are not consistent with the [[culture of the Philippines]] are enforced.&lt;ref name=RegisGuzmanp181&gt;Regis, Czarina Valerie A. and Allan B. de Guzman.

The '''German Central Library for the Blind''' ({{lang-de|Deutsche Zentralbücherei für Blinde}}), abbreviated '''DZB''', is a [[public library]] for the [[visually impaired]] located in the city of [[Leipzig]], [[Saxony]], [[Germany]]. Its collection of 72,300 titles is amongst the largest in the [[German speaking countries]].&lt;ref name = dzbstats/&gt; The institution consists of a lending library, a publishing house, and a research center for [[barrier-free]] communication. It also has production facilities for [[braille book]]s, [[audiobook]]s, and [[braille music]]. The DZB publishes about 250 new titles annually.&lt;ref name = dzbabout&gt;[http://www.dzb.de/en/about-us.html The DZB: About Us]. Leipzig: DZB, 2011. Retrieved 08-Aug-2012&lt;/ref&gt; Founded in 1894, the DZB is the oldest library for the blind in Germany.&lt;ref name = goethe&gt;Dagmar Giersberg: [http://www.goethe.de/wis/bib/dos/bip/sac/en82057.htm Online "All Ears and within Reach – The German Central Library for the Blind in Leipzig."] Bonn: Goethe Institute, November 2006. Retrieved 08-Aug-2012&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
A private association, the Society for the Procurement of [[Large-print]] Books and Work Opportunities for the Blind ({{lang-de|Verein zur Beschaffung von Hochdruckschriften und Arbeitsgelegenheit für Blinde zu Leipzig}}), was established in [[Leipzig]] in 1894 to provide blind persons with literature and employment.&lt;ref name = dzbhistory&gt;[http://www.dzb.de/en/about-us/history.html "A Piece of History"], Leipzig: DZB, 2011. {{en icon}} Retrieved 08-Aug-2012&lt;/ref&gt; It was set up in a bookseller's house and grew into the first library for blind persons in the [[German Empire]]. Soon afterward the society established its own publishing house and printing press. A [[charitable foundation]], the ''Verein zur Förderung der Deutschen Zentralbücherei für Blinde'', was established in 1916 to support and promote the library. By this time over 5,000 braille volumes were available and it had 1,200 regular users.&lt;ref name = dzbgeschichte&gt;[http://www.dzb.de/index.php?site_id=8.2#geschichte "Geschichte der DZB"], Leipzig: DZB, 2011. {{icon de}} Retrieved 08-Aug-2012&lt;/ref&gt;

Following [[World War I]], the number of users rose sharply and by 1926 the DZB had 3,500 users. The [[Great Depression]] forced the library into a rigid austerity, resulting in budget cuts and layoffs. In 1935 the DZB moved into the commercial publishing house ''Druckhaus Klepzig'' on the Täubchenweg in Leipzig. This building was later destroyed in an [[Bombing of Leipzig in World War II|Allied bombing raid]] in December 1943 and over 30,000 of the library's books were lost. What little remained of the collection was set up at an alternative site at [[Döbeln]] in 1944.&lt;ref name = dzbgeschichte/&gt;

[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-24637-2089, Leipzig, Zentralbücherei für Blinde.jpg|thumb|235px|right|The DZB in 1954]]
In the immediate aftermath of [[World War II]] the DZB moved to new quarters on the Weißenfelser Straße with a collection of 1,802 books. Through a decision of the provincial government on 7 November 1946 the library was declared a public institution. By 1949 the library's collection had reached 10,000 volumes. In 1952 DZB came under the auspices of the [[East German]] Ministry of Education and in 1955 it was subject to the Ministry of Culture. In 1954 the library moved into the building still in use today in Gustav-Adolf-Straße (Gustavus Adolphus Street).&lt;ref name = dzbgeschichte/&gt;

Following [[German reunification]] the DZB became an agency of the State Ministry of Science and Arts of the new [[Free State of Saxony]].&lt;ref name = dzbhistory/&gt;

==Collection==
As of December 2011 the library holds some 72,300 titles. A research section holds books, periodicals and monographs on visual impairment. In addition, the DZB regularly publishes 18 different journals in Braille and in audio versions. The DZB's collection includes:&lt;ref name = dzbstats&gt;''DZB in Zahlen und Fakten'', December 2011. [http://www.dzb.de/index.php?site_id=8.2 DZB online] {{icon de}},  retrieved 08-Aug-2012&lt;/ref&gt;

*72,300 total items
**21,900 [[Braille book]]s
**19,000 [[DAISY]] [[audiobook]]s
**6,100  [[Braille music]] books
**5,000  Scientific books and monographs on visual impairment

Each year the DZB produces about 250 new titles. It has a staff of 77 employees, 15 of whom are persons with disabilities. According to the DZB, "over 5,000 members use the library's different services."&lt;ref name = dzbabout /&gt;

==Braille music facilities==
The "DaCapo" project, funded by the [[Federal Ministry of Health (Germany)|German Federal Ministry of Health]], began at the DZB in 2003 to produce specialty [[sheet music]] for the blind. The goal is not only to make musical scores more widely available to the visually impaired, but also to improve career opportunities for blind musicians. The DZB's research center is also developing processes for the computer-assisted production of sheet music in Braille and as well as transmission services.&lt;ref name = goethe/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|author=Thomas Kahlisch, Matthias Leopold and Christian Waldvogel|title=DaCapo, a Project on Transforming Ink Printed to Braille Notes Semi-automatically|series=Lecture Notes in Computer Science; vol. 3118 |encyclopedia=Computers Helping People with Special Needs|pages=623|date=November 2004|publisher=Springer |location=Berlin / Heidelberg|pmid=|doi=10.1007/978-3-540-27817-7_34|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-540-27817-7_34
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''MakeBraille'' rendering service accepts digital [[musical notation]] files over the Internet in [[Capella (notation program)|CapXML]] and [[MusicXML]] formats to produce sheet music in Braille format, available for private, non-commercial uses only.

'''''God's Own Country''''' is a 2017 British drama film written and directed by [[Francis Lee (director)|Francis Lee]] in his feature directorial debut. The film stars [[Josh O'Connor]] and [[Alec Secăreanu]]. The plot follows a young sheep farmer in [[Yorkshire]] whose life is transformed by the arrival of a Romanian migrant worker. The film was the only UK-based production to feature in the world drama category at the 2017 [[Sundance Film Festival]] where it won the world cinema directing award.

==Plot==
In Yorkshire, Johnny lives on the family farm with his father, Martin, and grandmother, Deirdre. Due to his father having suffered from a stroke, and his grandmother's age, much of the day-to-day running of the farm falls to Johnny. In his social time, Johnny engages in binge drinking and furtive sexual encounters with other men. Returning late to the farm after such an encounter with a young male auctioneer, he is berated by his father after a calf dies from a [[breech birth]] in his absence.

Gheorghe, a Romanian migrant worker, is hired as extra help for [[lambing season]]. He arrives and spends his first night in a caravan that the family has organized as his accommodation. As the ewes have moved away from the main part of the farm, and as part of the farm's boundary wall remains unrepaired by Johnny, it is decided that Johnny and Gheorghe should spend several days camping nearer to the animals. When one of the ewes gives birth to an unconscious runt, Johnny is intrigued when Gheorghe is able to resuscitate and care for it. One morning, after Johnny refers to Gheorghe yet again as a "[[gypsy]]," Gheorghe tackles him to the ground and warns Johnny not to speak that way to him again.

The next day, the two men again engage in a fight that turns into rough sex. While Johnny initially does not acknowledge the encounter, the two share cigarettes and a sugar packet&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

That night, Gheorghe resists Johnny's aggressive move to have sex, instead patiently showing him that sex can also be tender, and the two men kiss for the first time.

Returning to the farm, Johnny invites Gheorghe to stay with him in the house, but Gheorghe elects to remain in the caravan. When Martin suffers a second stroke, Johnny realizes that the running of the farm is now entirely his responsibility, and asks Gheorghe if he will stay with him. When Gheorghe expresses uncertainty over whether they can stay together and maintain the farm simultaneously, Johnny reacts poorly, over-drinking and engaging in another random sexual encounter. When Gheorghe realises what Johnny has done, he abruptly leaves the farm.

Martin is released from the hospital, but is now fully debilitated. Johnny, desperate to make up with Gheorghe, tells his father that he will stay to run the farm, but that things must be run on his terms. Martin gives his tacit approval to Johnny, who sets off to bring Gheorghe back to the farm. After he finds Gheorghe working in Scotland, the two men reconcile. Gheorghe returns with Johnny; the caravan is taken away, and Gheorghe moves into the house.&lt;ref name=":TA:"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Rahman|first1=Miran|title=Planned feature film could receive key funding support|url=http://www.thetelegraphandargus.co.uk/news/11399303.Planned_feature_film_could_receive_key_funding_support/|accessdate=11 January 2017|work=Bradford Telegraph and Argus|date=9 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":BFI:"&gt;{{cite web|title=British Council Film: God's Own Country|url=http://film.britishcouncil.org/gods-own-country|website=film.britishcouncil.org|publisher=British Film Council|accessdate=11 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''God's Own Country'' received critical acclaim. It holds a 99% approval rating on review aggregator website [[Rotten Tomatoes]], based on 102 reviews, with a [[Weighted arithmetic mean|weighted average]] of 8.2/10. The site's critical consensus reads: "A quiet, moving rumination on loneliness and newfound intimacy, ''God's Own Country'' marks an outstanding directorial debut for Francis Lee." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/gods_own_country_2017/|title=God's Own Country|website=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|accessdate=3 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; On [[Metacritic]], the film holds a rating of 85 out of 100, based on 22 critics, indicating "universal acclaim".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/movie/gods-own-country|title=God's Own Country|website=[[Metacritic]]|accessdate=3 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Sundance Film Festival's listing for ''God's Own Country'' says that "you can smell the mud in this movie" while also describing Francis Lee as a major new talent and the film as "one not to be missed."&lt;ref name=":SI:" /&gt; [[Peter Bradshaw]], writing in ''The Guardian'', gave the film four stars out of five. Bradshaw described the film as "an almost, but not quite a Dales ''[[Brokeback Mountain|Brokeback]],''" and also as a  "very British love story, bursting at the seams with unspoken emotions, unvoiced fears about the future, and a readiness to displace every emotion into hard physical work".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Bradshaw|first1=Peter|title=God's Own Country review – Dales answer to Brokeback that's a very British love story|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/jan/22/gods-own-country-review-a-dales-answer-to-brokeback-thats-a-very-british-love-story|accessdate=29 January 2017|work=The Guardian|date=22 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ed Potton, writing in ''The Times'', gave the film four stars out of five and described the film as "splendid" and "[a] potent film, a Yorkshire ''Brokeback Mountain''".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Potton|first1=Ed|title=It's Brokeback on the moors|work=The Times|issue=72317|date=1 September 2017|location=Times 2|page=8|issn=0140-0460}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''High Energy Biscuits''' (HEB) are [[wheat]] [[biscuit]]s containing high-[[protein]] [[cereal]]s and [[vegetable fat]]. Because of their high energy-to-weight ratio they are procured by the [[World Food Programme]], the [[food aid]] branch of the [[United Nations]], for feeding disaster victims worldwide.&lt;ref name="Em5"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.em5aid.com/heb.php |title=Em5 Aid-High Energy Biscuits |publisher=Em5aid.com |date= |accessdate=2015-02-20 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150215065840/http://em5aid.com/heb.php |archive-date=2015-02-15 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

HEBs have been provided to a variety of geographical locations. For example, HEBs were delivered to [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] after the [[2008 South Ossetia war]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wfp.org/english/?ModuleID=137&amp;Key=2907 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-08-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080823203656/http://www.wfp.org/english/?ModuleID=137&amp;Key=2907 |archivedate=2008-08-23 |df= }} &lt;/ref&gt; HEBs were also airlifted to [[Kenya]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wfp.org/english/?ModuleID=137&amp;Key=2294 |accessdate=August 22, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080813184431/http://www.wfp.org/english/?ModuleID=137&amp;Key=2294 |archivedate=August 13, 2008|title=High energy biscuits airlifted to Kenya to feed 200,000 flood victims }}&lt;/ref&gt; and more recently distributed in aid in the [[2010 Haiti earthquake]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.star-telegram.com/190/story/1894280.html] {{dead link|date=September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 80 tonnes of high energy biscuits were delivered to the Tunisian border in response to the Libyan crisis.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bernama.com.my/bernama/v5/newsindex.php?id=567469]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110301103759/http://www.bernama.com.my/bernama/v5/newsindex.php?id=567469 |date=March 1, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

HEBs are usually packaged in cardboard boxes weighing 10&amp;nbsp;kg each.&lt;ref name="comp"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://wfpen.ernsystems.com/publicfiles/HighEnergyBiscuits.pdf |accessdate=August 22, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090327005543/https://wfpen.ernsystems.com/publicfiles/HighEnergyBiscuits.pdf |archivedate=March 27, 2009 |title=High Energy Biscuits }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Composition==
Per 100&amp;nbsp;g, HEBs have a minimum of 450&amp;nbsp;kcal of energy, 4.5% maximum moisture, a minimum of 10-15&amp;nbsp;g of protein, a minimum of 15&amp;nbsp;g fat, and 10-15&amp;nbsp;g sugar at a maximum.&lt;ref name="comp"/&gt;

There are around 120,000 '''Hungarians in Germany'''.&lt;ref name=Germany&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.buod.de/H/kere-h.htm|title=General Information - Hungarians in Germany|work=Association of Hungarian Organisations in Germany|language=Hungarian|accessdate=2009-10-25 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090207091501/http://buod.de/H/kere-h.htm |archivedate=2009-02-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Hungarians have emigrated here since the Middle Ages. However, after World War I, their number continues to grow at an increased pace. Today, around 75% of this population live in the states of [[Bavaria]], [[Baden-Württemberg]] and [[Hessen]].&lt;ref name=Germany/&gt;

==Population==
Only about 60% arrived with a Hungarian passport, as many of them arrived from areas of the former [[Kingdom of Hungary]]&lt;ref name=Germany/&gt; (see [[Treaty of Trianon]], 1920).

Major population changes:
*About 30,000 arrived [[Hungary during World War II|after 1945]]
*About 25,000 arrived after the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1956]]
*25,000 [[Gastarbeiter]] from [[Yugoslavia]] after 1960
*Around 5,000 migrants from Czechoslovakia after the [[Prague Spring]] of 1968
*Approx. 30,000 [[Hungarians in Romania|Hungarians from Transylvania]] after 1975
*About 15,000 fleeing [[People's Republic of Hungary|communism in Hungary]]
*15,000 moving to [[East Germany]] (until the 1990 [[German reunification]])

==Culture==
In 2006/2007, Hungary presented its country and culture in Germany with a whole series of cultural events including the exhibition "Germans in Hungary – Hungarians in Germany. European Lives".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bundesregierung.de/Content/EN/Artikel/2007/07/2007-07-05-deutsche-und-ungarn-starten-arche-europa__en,layoutVariant=Druckansicht.html |title=Germans and Hungarians launch "Europe's Ark" |work=Press and Information Office of the German Government |accessdate=2016-06-01 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110926231624/http://www.bundesregierung.de/Content/EN/Artikel/2007/07/2007-07-05-deutsche-und-ungarn-starten-arche-europa__en%2ClayoutVariant%3DDruckansicht.html |archivedate=2011-09-26 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Iranian Georgians''' ({{lang-ka|ირანის ქართველები}}; {{lang-fa|گرجی‌های ایران}}) are [[Iran]]ian citizens who are ethnically [[Georgians|Georgian]], and are an ethnic group living in Iran. Today's [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] was a subject to Iran from the 16th century till the early 19th century, starting with the [[Safavids]] in power. [[Shah Abbas I]], his predecessors, and successors, relocated by force hundreds of thousands of [[Christianity in Georgia|Christian]], and [[Georgian Jews|Jewish]] [[Georgians]] as part of his programs to reduce the power of the [[Qizilbash]], develop industrial economy, strengthen the military, and populate newly built towns in various places in [[Iran]] including the provinces of [[Isfahan]] and [[Mazandaran]].&lt;ref&gt;Matthee, Rudolph P.

===Safavid era===
{{Expand section|date=May 2015}}
Most likely, the first extant community of Georgians within Iran was formed following [[Shah Tahmasp I's invasions of Georgia]] and the rest of the [[Caucasus]], in which he deported some 30,000 Georgians and other Caucasians back to mainland [[Safavid Iran]].&lt;ref&gt;Hamilton Alexander Rosskeen Gibb, Bernard Lewis, Johannes Hendrik Kramers, Charles Pellat, Joseph Schacht. [https://books.google.nl/books?id=PJPrAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=tahmasp+I+30,000+men+and+women+georgia&amp;dq=tahmasp+I+30,000+men+and+women+georgia&amp;hl=nl&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CBwQ6AEwAGoVChMIyK_o-sbmyAIVwZYPCh14RQtr ''The Encyclopaedia of Islam, parts 163-178''] (Volume 10).

A certain amount also migrated as [[Ethnic cleansing of the Circassians|muhajirs]] in the 19th century to Iran, following the Russian conquest of the [[Caucasus]]. 
The Georgian deportees were settled by the Shah's government into the scarcely populated lands which were quickly made by their new inhabitants into the lively agricultural areas. Many of these new settlements were given Georgian names, reflecting the toponyms found in Georgia. During the [[Safavid]] era, Georgia became so politically and somewhat culturally intertwined with Iran that Georgians replaced the [[Qizilbash]] among the Safavid officials, alongside the [[Circassians]] and [[Armenians]].
[[File:როსტომ ხანი.gif|thumb|right|170px|[[Rostom of Kartli|Rostom]] (also known as ''Rustam Khan''), viceroy of [[Kingdom of Kartli|Kartli]], eastern [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], from 1633-1658.]]
During his travels the Italian adventurer [[Pietro Della Valle]] claimed that there was no household in Persia without its Georgian slaves, noticing the huge amounts of Georgians present everywhere in society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.academia.edu/1615432/Enc.Ir._Georgians_in_Safavid_iran|title=Georgians in Safavid Iran|accessdate=26 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The later Safavid capital, Isfahan, was home to many Georgians. Many of the city’s inhabitants were of Georgian, [[Circassians|Circassian]], and [[Dagestan|Daghistani]] descent.&lt;ref name="Isfahan-Safavid Period VII"&gt;[http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/isfahan-vii-safavid-period Isfahan-Safavid Period VII]&lt;/ref&gt; Engelbert Kaempfer, who was in Safavid Persia in 1684-85, estimated their number at 20,000.&lt;ref name="Isfahan-Safavid Period VII"/&gt;{{sfn|Matthee|2012|page=67}} Following an agreement between Shah Abbas I and his Georgian subject  [[Teimuraz I of Kakheti]] ("Tahmuras Khan"), whereby the latter submitted to Safavid rule in exchange for being allowed to rule as the region’s wāli (governor) and for having his son serve as [[darugha|dāruḡa]] ("prefect") of Isfahan in perpetuity, a Georgian prince converted to Islam served as governor.&lt;ref name="Isfahan-Safavid Period VII"/&gt; He was accompanied by a certain number of soldiers, and they spoke in [[Georgian language|Georgian]] among themselves.&lt;ref name="Isfahan-Safavid Period VII"/&gt; There must also have been some Georgian [[Georgian Orthodox Church|Orthodox Christians]].&lt;ref name="Isfahan-Safavid Period VII"/&gt; The royal court in Isfahan had a great number of Georgian ḡolāms (military slaves) as well as Georgian women.&lt;ref name="Isfahan-Safavid Period VII"/&gt; Although they spoke Persian or Turkic, their [[mother tongue]] was Georgian.&lt;ref name="Isfahan-Safavid Period VII"/&gt;

During the last days of the [[Safavid]] empire, the Safavids arch enemy, namely the neighboring [[Ottoman Turks]], as well as neighboring [[Imperial Russia]], but also the tribal [[Demographics of Afghanistan|Afghans]] from the far off easternmost regions of the empire took advantage of Iranian internal weakness and invaded Iran.
The Iranian Georgian contribution in wars against the invading Afghans was crucial. Georgians fought in the battle of Golnabad, and in the battle of [[Fereydunshahr]]. In the latter battle they brought a humiliating defeat to the Afghan army.

In total, the Persian sources mention that during the Safavid era 225,000 Georgians were transplanted to mainland Iran during the first two centuries, while the Georgian sources keep this number at 245,000.&lt;ref name="Iranian Georgians"&gt;Babak Rezvani. [https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Babak_Rezvani/publication/228110081_Iranian_Georgians_Prerequisites_for_a_Research/links/0fcfd4ff49600769aa000000.pdf Iranian Georgians]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Afsharid era===
{{Expand section|date=May 2015}}
During the [[Afsharid dynasty]], 5,000 Georgian families were moved to mainland Iran according to the Persian sources,&lt;ref name="Iranian Georgians"/&gt; while the Georgian sources keep it on 30,000 persons.&lt;ref name="Iranian Georgians"/&gt;

===Qajar era===
{{Expand section|date=May 2015}}
During the [[Qajar dynasty]], the last Iranian empire that would, despite very briefly, have effective control over Georgia, 15,000 Georgians were moved to Iran according to the Persian sources, while the Georgian ones mention 22,000 persons.&lt;ref name="Iranian Georgians"/&gt; This last large wave of Georgian movement and settlement towards mainland Iran happened as a result of the [[Battle of Krtsanisi]] in 1795.

===Modern Iran===
Despite their isolation from Georgia, many Georgians have preserved their language and some traditions, but embraced Islam. The ethnographer Lado Aghniashvili was first from Georgia to visit this community in 1890.

In the aftermath of [[World War I]], the Georgian minority in Iran was caught in the pressures of the rising [[Cold War]]. In 1945, this compact ethnic community, along with other ethnic minorities that populated northern Iran, came to the attention of the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] as a possible instrument for fomenting unrest in Iranian domestic politics. While the [[Georgian SSR|Soviet Georgian]] leadership wanted to repatriate them to Georgia, Moscow clearly preferred to keep them in Iran. The Soviet plans were abandoned only after [[Joseph Stalin]] realized that his plans to obtain influence in northern Iran foiled by both Iranian stubbornness and United States pressure.&lt;ref&gt;Svetlana Savranskaya and Vladislav Zubok (editors), [http://www.wilsoncenter.org/topics/pubs/f-research_notes.pdf Cold War International History Project Bulletin, I issue, 14/15 – Conference Reports, Research Notes and Archival Updates] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061215145138/http://www.wilsoncenter.org/topics/pubs/f-research_notes.pdf |date=2006-12-15 }}, p. 401. [[Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars]]. Accessed on September 16, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2004, the new Georgian president, [[Mikheil Saakashvili]], became the first Georgian politician to have visited the Iranian Georgian community in Fereydunshahr. Thousands of local Georgians gave the delegation a warm welcome, which included waving of the newly adopted [[Flag of Georgia (country)|Georgian national flag]] with its five crosses.&lt;ref&gt;Sanikidze, George.

{{see also|Fereydan}}
[[File:Georg54.jpg|thumb|right| A pastry shop in [[Fereydunshahr]] with Georgian signage.]]
The [[Georgian language]] is still used by a minority of people in Iran. The center of [[Georgian people|Georgians]] in Iran is [[Fereydunshahr]], a small city, 150&amp;nbsp;km to the west of [[Isfahan (city)|Isfahan]] in the area historically known as [[Fereydan]]. In this area there are 10 Georgian towns and villages around Fereydunshahr. In this region the old Georgian identity is retained the best compared to other places in Iran, and most people speak and understand the Georgian language there.

There were other compact settlements in [[Greater Khorasan|Khorasan]] at [[Abbas Aba]]d (half-way between [[Shahrud, Iran|Shahrud]] and [[Sabzevar]] where there remained only one old woman who remembered Georgian in 1934), [[Mazandaran]] at [[Behshahr]] and Farah Abad, [[Gilan]], [[Isfahan Province]] at [[Najafabad]], [[Badrud]], [[Rahmatabad, Natanz|Rahmatabad]], Yazdanshahr and Amir Abad. These areas are frequently called [[Gorji Mahalleh, Mazandaran|Gorji Mahalleh]] ("Georgian neighborhood"). Many Georgians or Iranians of partial Georgian descent are also scattered in major Iranian cities, such as [[Tehran]], [[Isfahan]], [[Rasht]], [[Karaj]] and [[Shiraz]]. 
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Grave-geo.jpg|thumb|right| A gravesite in [[Fereydunshahr]] with Georgian inscriptions.]] --&gt;
Most of these communities no longer speak the Georgian language, but retain aspects of Georgian culture and keep a Georgian conscious.{{sfn|Mikaberidze|2015|page=291}} Some argue that Iranian Georgians retain remnants of Christian traditions, but there is no evidence for this. Most Georgians in Fereydunshahr and Fereydan speak and understand Georgian. Iranian Georgians observe the Shia traditions and also non-religious traditions similar to other people in Iran. They observe the traditions of [[Nowruz]].

The local self-designation of Georgians in Iran, like the rest of the Georgians over the world is ''[[Kartveli]]'' ({{lang-ka|ქართველი}}, from Kartvelebi, Georgian: ქართველები, namely ''Georgians''), although occasionally the ethonyms Gorj, Gorji, or even Gurj-i (from [[Persian language|Persian]] "Gorji" which means Georgian). They call their language Kartuli (Georgian: ქართული). As Rezvani states, this is not surprising given that all other Georgian dialects in Iran are extinct.

The number of Georgians in Iran is estimated to be over 100,000. According to Encyclopaedia Georgiana (1986) some 12,000–14,000 lived in rural Fereydan c. 1896,&lt;ref&gt;''Encyclopaedia Georgiana'' (1986), vol. 10, Tbilisi: p. 263.&lt;/ref&gt; and a more recent estimation cited by Rezvani (published 2009, written in 2008) states that there may be more than 61,000 Georgians in Fereydan.&lt;ref&gt;Rezvani, Babak. ''The Fereydani Georgian Representation of Identity and Narration of History '' 2009 Journal; Anthropology of the Middle East. Berghahn Journals. Vol 4. No 2. p 52&lt;/ref&gt;  Modern-day estimations regarding the number of Iranian Georgians are that they compose over 100,000, but these numbers are obvious underestimations as it is believed that the modern Iranian Georgians are more than Georgians in Georgia. (3,500,000 +). They are also the largest Caucasus-derived group in the nation, ahead of the [[Circassians in Iran|Circassians]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.nl/books?id=stl97FdyRswC&amp;pg=PA141&amp;lpg=PA141&amp;dq=number+of+circassians+in+iran&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=u_SmExfuC8&amp;sig=2lK8k9IsUQZyjCtdKqIAIr6Rc5M&amp;hl=nl&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CDwQ6AEwBDgKahUKEwins7Whz4vGAhVRCNsKHb9pAME#v=onepage&amp;q=number%20of%20circassians%20in%20iran&amp;f=false ''Encyclopedia of the Peoples of Africa and the Middle East''] Facts On File, Incorporated {{ISBN|143812676X}} p 141&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Lakkia language''' ({{zh|c=拉珈语|p=Lājiāyǔ}}), also spelled '''Lakkja''', is a [[Kra–Dai language]] spoken in [[Jinxiu Yao Autonomous County]], [[Laibin]], east-central [[Guangxi]], [[China]].

Lakkia speakers are thought to have migrated from further east, possibly from the [[Biao language|Biao]]-speaking areas of northwestern [[Guangdong]] province (L.-Thongkum 1992). Today, they live mostly in the Dayaoshan ({{zh|c=大瑶山|l=Big Yao Mountain}}) region of [[Jinxiu Yao Autonomous County|Jinxiu County]].

==Names==
Lakkia people are also known as the ''Cháshān Yáo'' 茶山瑶, meaning "Tea Mountain Yao", since they were traditionally considered by neighboring peoples to be ethnic [[Yao people]]. The name ''Lakkia'' is an autonym (self-designated name) that means "mountain people". All Lakkia dialects have 5 [[tone (linguistics)|tone]]s.

==Classification==
There is currently no consensus on the classification of Lakkia within the Kra–Dai family. Solnit (1988) and Hansell (1988) classify Lakkia as a [[sister group|sister]] of the [[Kam–Sui languages|Kam–Sui]] branch. However, L.-Thongkum (1992) considers Lakkia to be most closely related to the [[Tai languages|Tai]] branch, based on the large number of shared lexical items.

==Dialects==
Dialects of Lakkia include (L.-Thongkum 1992):
*Jintian 金田
*Liula 六拉
*Jinxiu 金秀
*Lingzu 岭祖
*Changdong 长峒

The Lingzu dialect still preserves /kl-/ initial clusters, which corresponds to /kj-/ in most other dialects (L.-Thongkum 1992). Additionally, Changdong 长洞 and Jintian 金田 tone /51/ corresponds to Jinxiu 金秀 tone /231/. Also, L.-Thongkum (1992) reports that Jintian 金田 is a less conservative dialect.

A [[massacre]] is the deliberate slaughter of members of one group by one or more members of another more powerful group. A massacre may be indiscriminate or highly methodical in application. A massacre is a single event, though it may occur during the course of an extended military campaign or war. A massacre is separate from a battle (an event in which opposing sides fight), but may follow in its immediate aftermath, when one side has surrendered or lost the ability to fight, yet the victors persist in killing their opponents.

The '''Lori''' are a nomadic community found in the [[Balochistan]] region of [[Iran]] and [[Pakistan]]. They must not be confused with [[Lurs]], who are an entirely distinct people also living in Iran.&lt;ref name="Eurasian Studies 2002 pp 257-262"&gt;Coastal Makran as Corridor to the Indian Ocean World by Sabir Badalkhan in Eurasian Studies (2002): 1/2 pp 257-262&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Phillips"&gt;Phillips, David J. (2001) ''Peoples on the Move: introducing the nomads of the world'' Piquant, Carlisle, [https://books.google.com/books?id=54gyRnhIugkC&amp;pg=PA295 p. 295], {{ISBN|1-903689-05-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term "Lori" refers to trade designations not to an ethnicity.

== Origin ==

The Lori may be divided into two groupings, the settled Lori and the nomads. Historically, the settled Lori have two sub-divisions, the Sarmastani-Lori, who claim descent from Sarmast; their heroic ancestor (a blacksmith by profession) and the [[Zangeshahi]]. Most of the Lori in [[Balochistan]] claim descent from Sarmast. Zangeshahi are said to have originated from [[India]], and accompanied the [[Gichki]] [[Baloch people|Baloch]] in their migration from [[India]]. This community is found mainly in [[Panjgur]]. However, they are not Romanies/gypsies, but low-caste Beluchi. {{citation needed|date=October 2017}}

== Present circumstances ==

Traditionally, the Lori were the carpenters, blacksmiths and gold smiths of the Baloch country. A distinct group of Lori were musicians and entertainers. Each occupational group is distinguished by a special appellation, for example the carpenter is known as a dar trash Lori, the blacksmith is known as asinkar Lori, and a goldsmith is known as a zargar Lori. While those groups involved in entertainment are known as dohli, or drummers and are a strictly endogamous group. The dholi are also involved in jugglery, palmistry and fortune telling. Historically, they were also the sellers of donkeys, but this occupation has declined with the growth in modern transportation. Certain other duties were assigned to the Lori, such as preparing wedding feasts and playing musical instruments.&lt;ref name="Phillips"/&gt;

They speak the Beluchi language (as well as a jargon based on it, in Pakistan at any rate).

In the [[Kachhi region  (Balochistan)|Kachhi region ]] of Balochistan, the Lori live among both the Jamot and the Baloch and [[Brahui people|Brahui]]. Their traditional occupation was that of blacksmithi&lt;ref&gt;Phillips, David J. (2001) Peoples on the Move: introducing the nomads of the world Piquant, Carlisle, p. 295&lt;/ref&gt; with many of the women employed as midwives. Most Lori of [[Kachhi District|Kacchi]] also speak [[Seraiki language|Seraiki]], in addition to Balochi.&lt;ref&gt;Coastal Makran as Corridor to the Indian Ocean World by Sabir Badalkhan in Eurasian Studies (2002): 1/2 pp 257–262&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Mandari''' are a small [[ethnic group]] of [[South Sudan]] and one of the [[Nilotic peoples]].

The group is composed of [[cattle]]-herders and agriculturalists and are part of [[Karo people (East Africa)|Karo people]] which also includes [[Bari people| Bari]], [[Pojulu people| Pojulu]], [[Kakwa people| Kakwa]], [[Kuku people| Kuku]] and [[Nyangwara]]. [[Mandari language|Kutuk na Mundari]]  is also the name of their language, which is in similar to Kutuk na Kuku, Kutuk na Kakwa, Kutuk na Pojulu, Kutuk na Bari, and Kutuk na Nyangwara.

== Tribal land ==
The traditional Mundari tribal lands are located roughly 75 kilometers north of [[Juba, South Sudan|Juba]], the capital of South Sudan, and are centered on the town of Terekeka in the state of [[Central Equatoria]]. They are bordered to the north by the [[Bor, Sudan|Bor]] [[Dinka]] at Maliththoor, Anuet, and to the south by the [[Bari people (Sudan)|Bari]] of Juba 12 km at the [[Ku'da River]]. Their lands are bounded on the east by the [[White Nile]] and extend west to [[Laka Ma'di]] in [[Western Equatoria]] state, an area roughly 100 by 75 kilometers in size.

The land, like much of South Sudan, is predominantly flat and marked by occasional isolated large hills. The low-lying land contains many rivers and lakes and is prone to flooding during the [[rainy season]]. The soil is predominantly clay-based, causing drainage and water retention problems, and provides a very fertile basis in support of cattle grazing.

The main settlements in Mundariland are [[Terekeka]], [[Gemaiza, South Sudan|Gemaiza]], [[Mangalla,South Sudan|Mangalla]], [[Muni, South Sudan|Muni]], [[Tombe, South Sudan|Tombe]], [[Tindalo, South Sudan|Tindalo]], [[Tali, South Sudan|Tali]], [[Rego, South Sudan|Rego]], [[Tijor, South Sudan|Tijor]], [[Rijong, South Sudan]], [[Köwöri, South Sudan|Koweri]], and [[Nyori, South Sudan|Nyori]].

== Culture ==

The Mundari, like other nilotic tribes, are very cattle-oriented: cattle serves as food, a form of currency and a mark of status. [[Arranged marriage|Marriages are arranged]] by the prospective groom offering cattle to the bride's family and husbands may take as [[Polygyny|many wives]] as they can support. The Mundari engage in perennial cattle raiding wars with the [[Bor, South Sudan|Bor]] Dinka during the [[dry season]].

The Mundari also cultivate [[sorghum]] and catch fish using nets and spears.

In common with other nilotic tribes in Sudan, the Mundari practice [[ritual scarification]] as a [[rite of passage]] into adulthood for young men. The typical Mundari scar pattern consists of two sets of three parallel lines, each on either side of the forehead, extending in a downward slope and unconnected in the middle.

{{History of Burma}}
'''Mon kingdoms''' were political establishments by the [[Mon language|Mon]]-speaking people that ruled large sections of present-day [[Burma]] (Myanmar) at various times in the last 1200 years. The kingdoms in chronological order are the [[Thaton Kingdom]] (9th century–1057), the [[Hanthawaddy Kingdom]] (1287–1539), and the [[Restored Hanthawaddy Kingdom]] (1740–1757).

==Early states==
The first recorded kingdom attributed to the [[Mon people]] is [[Dvaravati]],&lt;ref name=Coedes&gt;{{cite book|last= Coedès|first= George|authorlink= George Coedès|editor= Walter F. Vella|others= trans.Susan Brown Cowing|title= The Indianized States of Southeast Asia|year= 1968|publisher= University of Hawaii Press|isbn= 978-0-8248-0368-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|63,76–77}} which prospered until around 1000 [[Common era|CE]] when their capital was sacked by the [[Khmer Empire]] and a significant portion of the inhabitants fled west to present-day Lower Burma and eventually founded new polities.

===Thaton (9th century–1057)===
{{Main article|Thaton Kingdom}}

Mainstream scholarship holds that the Mon established small polities (or large city-states) in Lower Burma. Both the city of [[Thaton]] and [[Bago, Burma|Pegu]] (Bago) are believed to have been established in the 9th century. The states were important trading ports between Indian Ocean and mainland Southeast Asia. Still, according to traditional reconstruction, the early Mon city-states were conquered by the [[Pagan Kingdom]] from the north in 1057, and that Thaton's literary and religious traditions helped to mould early Pagan civilisation.&lt;ref name=mha-32-33&gt;Htin Aung 1967: 32–33&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1050 and about 1085, Mon craftsmen and artisans helped to build some two thousand monuments at Pagan, the remains of which today rival the splendors of [[Angkor Wat]].&lt;ref name=as-67&gt;South 2003: 67&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Mon script]] is considered to be the source of the [[Burmese script]], the earliest evidence of which was dated to 1058, a year after the Thaton conquest, by the colonial era scholarship.&lt;ref name=geh-307&gt;Harvey 1925: 307&lt;/ref&gt;

However, recent research—still a minority view—argues that Mon influence on the interior after Anawrahta's conquest is a greatly exaggerated post-Pagan legend, and that Lower Burma in fact lacked a substantial independent polity prior to Pagan's expansion.&lt;ref name=vbl-91&gt;Lieberman 2003: 91&lt;/ref&gt; Possibly in this period, the delta sedimentation—which now extends the coastline by {{convert|3|mi|spell=in|abbr=off}}a century—remained insufficient, and the sea still reached too far inland, to support a population even as large as the modest population of the late precolonial era. (The earliest evidence of Burmese script is dated to 1035, and possibly as early as 984 CE. Recent research argues that the [[Pyu script]] was the source of the Burmese script.)&lt;ref name=mat-167-178-197-200&gt;Aung-Thwin 2005: 167–178, 197–200&lt;/ref&gt;

Though the size and importance of these states are still debated, all scholars accept that during the 11th century, Pagan established its authority in Lower Burma and this conquest facilitated growing cultural exchange, if not with local Mon, then with India and with Theravada stronghold Sri Lanka. From a geopolitical standpoint, Anawrahta's conquest of Thaton checked the Khmer advance in the [[Tenasserim coast]].&lt;ref name=vbl-91/&gt;

==Hanthawaddy (1287–1539, 1550–1552)==
{{Main article|Hanthawaddy Kingdom}}
In 1287, the Pagan Empire collapsed due to [[First Mongol invasion of Burma|Mongol invasions]], and all its vassal states became independent. In present-day Lower Burma, [[Wareru]] established a kingdom for the Mon-speaking people called [[Ramannadesa]] by unifying three Mon-speaking regions of Lower Burma: [[Martaban]] (Mottama), [[Pegu]] (Bago), the [[Irrawaddy delta]].&lt;ref name=mha-78-80&gt;Htin Aung 1967: 78–80&lt;/ref&gt; The kingdom's first capital was at Martaban but the capital was moved to Pegu in 1369.

For its first 100 years, the kingdom was merely a loose collection of three Mon-speaking regions. The high kings at the capital had little substantive authority over the vassals. Indeed, Martaban was in open rebellion from 1363 to 1389. A more centralised rule came with the reign of King [[Razadarit]], who not only firmly unified the three Mon-speaking regions together but also successfully fended off the northern [[Burmese language|Burmese]]-speaking [[Kingdom of Ava]] in the [[Forty Years' War]] (1385–1424). The war ended in a stalemate but it was a victory for Hanthawaddy as Ava finally gave up its dream of restoring the Pagan Empire. In the years following the war, Pegu occasionally aided Ava's southern vassal states of [[Prome Kingdom|Prome]] and [[Toungoo Dynasty|Toungoo]] in their rebellions but carefully avoided getting plunged into a full-scale war.

After the war, Hanthawaddy entered its golden age whereas its rival Ava gradually went into decline. From the 1420s to the 1530s, Hanthawaddy was the most powerful and prosperous kingdom of all post-Pagan kingdoms. Under a string of especially gifted monarchs—[[Binnya Ran I]], [[Shin Sawbu]], [[Dhammazedi]] and [[Binnya Ran II]]—the kingdom enjoyed a long golden age, profiting from foreign commerce. Its merchants traded with traders from across the Indian Ocean, filling the king's treasury with gold and silver, silk and spices, and all the other stuff of early modern trade. The kingdom also became a famous centre of [[Theravada Buddhism]]. It established strong ties with [[Ceylon]], and encouraged reforms that later spread throughout the country.&lt;ref name=rlf-64-65&gt;Myint-U 2006: 64–65&lt;/ref&gt;

The powerful kingdom's end came abruptly. Due to the inexperience of King [[Takayutpi]], the kingdom was captured by a smaller kingdom to the north, [[Toungoo Dynasty|Kingdom of Toungoo]] in 1539 led by King [[Tabinshwehti]] and his deputy Gen. [[Bayinnaung]]. Toungoo captured the Irrawaddy delta and Pegu in 1538–1539, and Martaban in 1541.&lt;ref name=geh-153-157&gt;Harvey 1925: 153–157&lt;/ref&gt; The kingdom was briefly revived in 1550 after Tabinshwehti was assassinated. But Bayinnaung quickly defeated the rebellion in 1552.

==Restored Hanthawaddy (1740–1757)==
{{Main article|Restored Hanthawaddy Kingdom}}

Though Toungoo kings would rule all of Lower Burma well into the mid-18th century, the golden age of Hanthawaddy was fondly remembered by the Mon. In 1740, they rose up against a weak Toungoo Dynasty on its last legs, and succeeded in restoring the fallen Hanthawaddy Kingdom. Supported by the [[French colonial empire|French]], the upstart kingdom quickly carved out a space for itself in Lower Burma, and continued its push northward. On 23 March 1752, its forces captured Ava, and ended the 266-year-old Toungoo dynasty.

A new dynasty called [[Konbaung dynasty|Konbaung]] led by King [[Alaungpaya]] rose in Upper Burma to challenge the southern forces, and went on to conquer all of Upper Burma by January 1754. After Hanthawaddy's second invasion of Upper Burma failed in May 1754, the kingdom's leadership in self-defeating measures killed off the Toungoo royal family, and persecuted ethnic Burmans in the south, both of which only strengthened Alaungpaya's hand.&lt;ref name=vbl-202-206&gt;Lieberman 2003: 202–206&lt;/ref&gt; In 1755, Alaungpaya invaded Lower Burma. Konbaung forces captured the [[Irrawaddy delta]] in May 1755, the French defended port of [[Thanlyin]] in July 1756, and finally the capital [[Bago, Burma|Pegu]] in May 1757.

The fall of Restored Hanthawaddy was the beginning of the end of Mon people's centuries-old dominance of Lower Burma. Konbaung armies' reprisals forced thousands of Mons to flee to [[Ayutthaya Kingdom|Siam]].&lt;ref name=rlf-97&gt;Myint-U 2006: 97&lt;/ref&gt; By the early 19th century, assimilation, inter-marriage, and mass migration of Burman families from the north had reduced the Mon population to a small minority.&lt;ref name=vbl-202-206/&gt;

'''New Kabul Bank''' is a bank in [[Afghanistan]] that has its main branch in the capital city of [[Kabul]]. It was established in 2004 as the '''Kabul Bank''', the first [[private bank]] in Afghanistan. After corruption and scandals it was re-established  in 2011 as the New Kabul Bank. 

It is the main bank used to pay the salaries of the national [[military of Afghanistan|army]] and [[Afghan National Police|security police forces]]. The bank provides facilities to maintain accounts in Current, Savings Bank, and Fixed Deposits; and offers its consumers branch and [[automated teller machine]] services. The bank is under the supervision of the [[Central Bank of Afghanistan]] (''Da Afghanistan Bank−DAB''), the General Directorate of Treasury, and the [[Ministry of Finance (Afghanistan)|Afghanistan Ministry of Finance]] (MOF).

==History==

===Founding in 2004===
[[File:Bakht.jpg|thumb|An advertisement for the ''Bakht Account'' (Lucky Account).]]
The Kabul Bank was established in 2004. 

Kabul Bank claims that accounts can be opened and maintained in [[Afghan afghani|afghani]], [[U.S. dollars]] and [[euro]]. Kabul Bank claims that it is connected throughout the globe with [[SWIFT]] facility, which enables fund transfer for its customers. The bank has correspondent relationship with seven international banks situated in Germany, China, [[Iran]], [[Tajikistan]], [[Saudi Arabia]] and India.

===Corruption scandal===
Kabul Bank was badly shaken and almost collapsed in 2011, in one of "the worst banking scandals in history," according to ''[[The Guardian]]'' newspaper.&lt;ref&gt;Boone, Jon, The Guardian (15 November 2011), (United Kingdom), "Afghan finance minister admits doubts over Kabul Bank's missing $1billion:  Omar Zakhiwal pledges to prove sceptics wrong as IMF backs asset recovery scheme after 18-month dispute" https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/nov/15/afghan-bank-missing-billion&lt;/ref&gt;  In late 2012, according to the ''Los Angeles Times'', independent investigators and journalists uncovered widespread corruption in Kabul Bank.&lt;ref name="articles.latimes.com"&gt;Zucchino, David, Los Angeles Times, (28 November 2012) "Report cites extensive corruption involving Afghan bank"http://articles.latimes.com/2012/nov/28/world/la-fg-wn-kabul-bank-corruption-report-20121128&lt;/ref&gt;  ''The New York Times'', in 2012, headlines indicate "Audit Says Kabul Bank Began as ‘Ponzi Scheme’" following investigation and judicial action in the aftermath of the Bank's crisis and scandal.&lt;ref&gt;Rosenberg, Matthem, New York Times, (26 November 2012) "Audit Says Kabul Bank Began as ‘Ponzi Scheme’" https://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/27/world/asia/kabul-bank-audit-details-extent-of-fraud.html?pagewanted=all&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, it was disclosed that its Chairman [[Sherkhan Farnood]] and other insiders were spending the bank's US$1 billion for their own personal lavish style living and lending money under the table to family, relatives and friends.  The bank scandal also involved members of Afghan President Karzai's family, including his brother [[Mahmood Karzai]]. In September 2010, one of the principal owners of the bank, said that depositors had withdrawn $180 million in two days and predicted a "revolution" in the country's financial system unless the Afghan government and the United States moved quickly to help stabilize the bank.&lt;ref name="Filkins"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/03/world/asia/03kabul.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss|title=Depositors Panic Over Bank Crisis in Afghanistan|last=Filkins|first=Dexter|newspaper=[[New York Times]]|date=2010-09-02|accessdate=2010-09-03}} {{cite news|url=http://www.uspolicyinabigworld.com/2012/06/12/how-they-robbed-kabulbank/|title=How They Robbed Kabul Bank|last=Huffman|first=Michael|newspaper=|date=2012-06-12}}{{dead link|date=February 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ahmad"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5jJma5WN_riCwDv-7SbQTEOx6AHsA?docId=CNG.f3c56da45464a41c1cd517b13c5de4ac.2a1|title=Afghan government orders all private banks to be audited

===Bank run and panic in 2010===
After only six years in operation, in 2010 there was a panic of customers seeking to withdraw their savings from the bank.  Despite nearly $1 billion in U.S. taxpayers' funded assistance in the form of Afghan government salaries deposited into Kabul Bank. Kabul Bank was on the brink of collapse and mobs of customers massed outside of bank locations trying to get their deposits out of the bank with limited luck.&lt;ref&gt;Riechmann, Deb and Faiez, Rahim, Associated Press ( September 2010 "Kabul Bank braces for run on deposits after doubts" http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1A1-D9HVIO4G2.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite Kabul Bank's near collapse in 2010 during the corruption allegations, Kabul Bank claims it is significant to Afghanistan's internal security and stability because it is the vehicle used to pay, largely with money supplied by the United States government, as many as 300,000 Afghan government employees, mostly military and police, who are key to plans to rebuild Afghanistan's capacity to deal with its ongoing [[Taliban]]-led insurgency.&lt;ref name=Ellis/&gt; President Karzai's brother, Mahmood Karzai, is reported to have played a significant role in the back scandal, and is alleged to have received millions of dollars in loans from Kabul Bank. He was later alleged to be under investigation by a U.S. Federal [[Grand Jury]] and U.S. tax authorities, including the U.S. [[Internal Revenue Service]] for tax evasion allegations.  Canada's ''[[Maclean's]]'' magazine reported that Mahmoud Karzai was being investigated for [[racketeering]]. [[extortion]] and [[tax evasion]] as a result of connections to the Bank and [[Hamid Karzai]].&lt;ref name="articles.latimes.com"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Belluz, Julia, MaClean's (Canada), (7 March 2011), "Mahmoud Karzai being investigated for racketeering, extortion and tax evasion: Prime Minister Hamid Karzai’s older sibling may face charges in the U.S."http://www2.macleans.ca/2011/03/07/band-of-brothers/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Spencer, Richard,  The Telegraph, (8 September 2010) (United Kingdom) "Hamid Karzai's brother made £500,000 on Kabul Bank property deal: The brother of the Afghan President Hamid Karzai made a half-million pound profit in eight months on a luxury villa in Dubai bought with a loan from the bank at the centre of a financial and political crisis in Kabul."  https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/afghanistan/7989594/Hamid-Karzais-brother-made-500000-on-Kabul-Bank-property-deal.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Higgins, Andrew, Financial Times (22 February 2010)  "Banker feeds crony capitalism in Afghanistan" www.ft.com/cms/s/0/c73eeaf2-1f85-11df-8975-00144feab49a.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Imbert, Louise,(11 November 2011), Le Monde Diplomatique (France - English Edition), "Hushed up scandal of the Kabul Bank

During the bank scandal and panic in September 2010, hundreds of Afghans, including many civil servants and their families, gathered outside Kabul Bank offices in the capital and elsewhere in Afghanistan. Long lines formed of depositors hoping to withdrawal some or all of their money. Afghan police beat back mobs at the Kabul Bank worried their money would be lost according to the ''Washington Post''. Panic set in among many depositors according to reports by the ''New York Times''.&lt;ref&gt;Filkins, Dexter, ''New York Times'' (2 September 2010) "Depositors Panic Over Bank Crisis in Afghanistan"https://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/03/world/asia/03kabul.html?_r=0&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 27, 2010, a suicide car bomber killed at least three Afghans, including one policeman, as he targeted police officers who lined up to withdraw their salaries in front of Kabul Bank in central [[Kandahar]]; the midday explosion  also wounded 16 policemen and five civilians, officials said.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052970204685004576045492277934656|title=Afghan Bomber Targets Officers, Kills at Least Three|newspaper=[[Wall Street Journal]]|last=Abi-Habib|first=Maria|date=2010-12-28|accessdate=2010-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2011 aftermath of panic===
On February 19, 2011, at least 38 people (including 13 policemen) were killed during an insurgent raid on a branch of Kabul Bank in [[Jalalabad]], the provincial capital of [[Nangarhar]], and at least three militants were killed, officials said.  Three suicide bombers reportedly entered the bank and detonated themselves, and fighting between insurgents and security forces continued for over four hours; President Hamid Karzai and a [[NATO]] [[International Security Assistance Force]] spokesman condemned the attack, which was the deadliest in the country since June 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2011/WORLD/asiapcf/02/20/afghanistan.attack/?hpt=T2|title=Insurgents raid Afghan bank; 38 killed|newspaper=[[CNN]]|date=2011-02-20|accessdate=2011-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In its July 2011 review of the Kabul Bank scandal and its aftermath, international non-governmental organization (NGO) [[Transparency International]] has raised repeated concerns about problems of [[corruption in Afghanistan]] and its impact on the economy, business investment, security and civil society.&lt;ref&gt;Gutcher, Lianne, The Guardian (UK) (19 July 2011) "Afghanistan's anti-corruption efforts thwarted at every turn:  Afghans now pay double the bribes of two years ago and Hamid Karzai has gone out of his way to curb anti-corruption initiatives;  Transparency International has raised concerns about the impact of corruption on the banking and financial sector in Afghanistan and its controversial links to the public sector and public officials." https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/jul/19/afghanistan-anti-corruption-efforts-thwarted&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bast, Andrew, Newsweek (2 August 2010)"Afghanistan Wants to See the Money" http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-232721485.html&lt;/ref&gt;

===2010 depositor panic and aftermath===

In early 2010, the ''[[Washington Post]]'' reported that the Kabul Bank played a part in "a crony capitalism that enriches politically connected insiders and dismays the Afghan populace."&lt;ref&gt;Washington Post, February 22, 2010, https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/02/21/AR2010022104317.html, {{cite news|url=http://www.uspolicyinabigworld.com/2011/12/03/the-kabul-bank-scandal-and-the-crisis-that-followed-2/|title=The Kabul Bank Scandal and the Crisis that Followed|last=Huffman|first=Michael|newspaper=|date=2011-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the beginning of September, Frozi, one of the two largest shareholders of Kabul Bank, said reports indicating that the institution had lost as much as $300 million were overstated. But he predicted that if Afghan depositors continued to withdraw their money at the current rate, Kabul Bank would almost certainly collapse, undermining confidence in the nascent financial system the Afghans have been trying to build with American help. "If this goes on, we won’t survive", Mr. Frozi said in an interview. "If people lose trust in the banks, there will be a revolution in the financial system."

Afghan leaders promised to guarantee deposits in an attempt to arrest the panic, which began at the end of August 2010 when the country's top banking officials demanded the resignations of both Frozi and Farnood.&lt;ref name="Filkins"/&gt;  "The government has decided that there will be an audit firm that will be coming to audit not only Kabul Bank accounts but also other private banks in Afghanistan", an Afghan presidential spokesman announced in late October.  Earlier in the month, the government also froze assets held by some of Kabul Bank's owners even as the central bank governor said it was solvent and had the backing of Karzai's administration.&lt;ref name="Ahmad"/&gt;  U.S.-educated economist Hamidullah Farooqi, a former Karzai minister and Chairman of the [[Afghanistan International Chamber of Commerce]], said Afghanistan received a "massive wake-up call" from the crisis, further stating:  "It's not just a lack of capacity in our institutions, there is a lack of laws and a lack of accountability, which is much more serious.  It's a case of the blind leading the blind.  They are too young, they are babies."&lt;ref name=Ellis/&gt;

[[Mahmood Karzai]] is one of the brothers of the Afghan President Hamid Karzai and a seven percent shareholder in the bank. In a telephone interview with the ''[[Boston Globe]]'' in September 2010, he said: "America should do something." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.boston.com/news/world/asia/articles/2010/09/03/karzais_brother_calls_on_us_to_help_avert_afghan_bank_run/ | work=The Boston Globe | first1=Andrew | last1=Higgins | first2=Ernesto | last2=Londono | title=Karzai's brother calls on US to help avert Afghan bank run | date=3 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In October, the ''[[Washington Post]]'' reported that Mahmood Karzai could soon be indicted for tax evasion in the U.S., though he denied the charges, telling the newspaper: "I'm very clean", and insisting his only interest was "rebuilding Afghanistan."&lt;ref name="Ahmad"/&gt;&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"/&gt;

In mid-January 2011, acting chief financial officer Rana Tayyab Tahir and other [[Pakistan]]i employees of Kabul Bank fled to Pakistan, apparently out of fear for their lives and possible arrest, though some said they were being made scapegoats for powerful shareholders.  Afghan authorities also called in several bank managers, including foreigners, for questioning and detained some in southern Afghanistan's [[Helmand Province]] in connection with illicit transfers of bank funds.&lt;ref name=Partlow/&gt;

In early February 2011, DAB Governor Abdul Qadir Fitrat said the central bank would impose stricter rules on banks wanting to handle about US$1.5 billion worth of salaries for government and security officials, which until now has been done by Kabul Bank.  Fitrat also told Reuters the total amount of money at risk over suspected irregularities at Kabul Bank amounted to $579 million, almost twice the figure estimated when the bank's troubles first surfaced.  Fitrat dismissed concerns that it faced [[liquidation]], saying it would be privately owned again within three years. "Kabulbank is stabilised, it has enough cash at its disposal and the central bank is trying to rehabilitate the bank and then at some point sell it to potential buyers in two or three years," Fitrat told Reuters.&lt;ref name=Burch/&gt;  In early July 2011, Fitrat resigned as head of the central bank after fleeing to the United States, claiming his life had been threatened and that he was being made a scapegoat for politically connected individuals.&lt;ref name=Shah/&gt;

After a mid-February 2011 visit by Neal Wolin, the U.S. deputy [[United States Department of the Treasury|Treasury]] secretary, the Afghan finance ministry said that weak international support had exacerbated the crisis.  “Afghan and US officials agreed that (the crisis)... was compounded by the erroneous audit by [[PricewaterhouseCoopers]], and ineffective international technical assistance and supervision,” the ministry said.  However, Wolin pressed the government to rapidly place the lender into [[receivership]], echoing calls made by a previous [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF) delegation.  “The deputy secretary... stressed the need for the Afghan government to take swift and decisive action to ensure a credible, effective resolution of issues related to Kabul Bank," the U.S. embassy said in statement.&lt;ref name="FinTimes"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/41d4d2ce-3b3f-11e0-9970-00144feabdc0.html?ftcamp=rss#axzz1EQKxrGjk|title=Kabul rebukes outsiders over bank crisis role|newspaper=[[Financial Times]]|last=Green|first=Matthew|date=2011-02-18|accessdate=2011-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Kabul Bank was put into receivership following the scandal and a new bank set up, but only $70 million of fraudulent loans it granted have so far been recovered, with criminal investigations ongoing.  In October 2011, Afghanistan's parliament approved a $51 million payment to DAB as part of a planned compensation package over its multi-million-dollar bailout; the payment is part of a package of government measures agreed with the IMF to secure a new loan. Afghanistan has been without an IMF program since the Kabul Bank failure, but the IMF announced that it is moving ahead on a new $129 million loan in the wake of the government's reform promises, with a new program expected to be submitted to the IMF executive board for approval in November 2011.&lt;ref name="AFP"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5ic65_Z76Lci4N2dGFaCSlnz23zQw?docId=CNG.d47c1989dfe7f8200937897242970663.1b1|title=Afghan parliament approves $51m payout over Kabul Bank|newspaper=[[Agence France-Presse|AFP]]|date=2011-10-16|accessdate=2011-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the end of June 2011, the ''[[Washington Post]]'' reported that Farnood and Frozi used fake names, forged documents, fictitious companies and secret records as part of an elaborate ruse to funnel hundreds of millions of dollars to shareholders and top Afghan officials, including President Karzai's brother Mahmood and [[Mohammed Fahim]], the country's first vice president.  Both Farnood and Frozi were arrested in Kabul and held without charge, even though Afghanistan's attorney general said the evidence against them was "quite clear."  Without a successful resolution of Kabul Bank’s problems, one senior U.S. official said Afghanistan could face "the collapse of the banking sector."&lt;ref name="Partlow2"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/asia-pacific/elaborate-ruse-behind-vast-kabul-bank-fraud/2011/06/30/AGL3bmsH_story.html|title=Elaborate ruse behind vast Kabul Bank fraud|newspaper=[[Washington Post]]|last=Partlow|first=Joshua|date=2011-06-30|accessdate=2011-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As of October 2011, neither man had yet been charged with a crime, but Deputy Attorney General [[Enayatullah Nazari]] said the government intends to bring them to court.

“A crime has happened,” Nazari said. “They will go to the court whether they manage to secure the money or not.”  Authorities loosened the terms of their detention and provided them with a security detail to go to a bank office on workdays and on occasion to fancy restaurants and hotels for what Nazari described as work meetings.&lt;ref name=Londono/&gt;

===Depositor losses from collapse===

With regard to public sector [[corruption in Afghanistan]] and the loss of nearly U.S. $1 billion in U.S. taxpayers' funded foreign assistance to Afghanistan in the form of U.S.-supplied Afghan government and Afghan military and police salaries deposited into Kabul Bank, ''The New Yorker Magazine'', the ''Wall Street Journal'', the ''New York Times'', ''National Public Radio'' (NPR) and others, have reported that widespread corruption, ponzi schemes, fraudulent loans, mass looting, insider loans to fake and bogus companies run by family and friends, and other corrupted practices, were undertaken by a small group of Afghan insiders (less than 12 people), apparently linked to [[Mahmoud Karzai]], President [[Hamid Karzai]] and [[Ahmed Wali Karzai]].&lt;ref&gt;The Independent, (February 2011) (UK)  "Afghan Elite 'Plundered $900M' from Leading Bank"  http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-27826545.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;International Wire, CNN (28 November 2012) "Widespread Corruption at Kabul Bank in Afghanistan" http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P3-2826806991.html&lt;/ref&gt;  This resulted in nearly $1 billion ($900 million) in Kabul Bank's deposits seemingly vanishing into [[Dubai]] and other off-shore locations and unknown offshore bank accounts and [[tax havens]].  Hundreds of millions of U.S. dollars were often smuggled and flown out of Afghanistan secretly stashed in bags and airline food trays &lt;ref&gt;Davidson, Amy, New Yorker Magazine, (1 September 2010) "Too Corrupt to Fail?" http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/closeread/2010/09/too-corrupt-to-fail.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sutherland, J.J., National Public Radio (NPR), (27 September 2010) "Karzai Brother Being Investigated For Corruption" https://www.npr.org/blogs/thetwo-way/2010/09/27/130152430/karzai-brother-being-investigated-for-corruption&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Davidson, Amy, The New Yorker (7 June 2012), "The Karzai Rule : Who Pays for Corruption in Afghanistan"&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 2012 anti-corruption report and reform efforts===
On November 28, 2012, the Independent Joint Anti-Corruption [[Monitoring and Evaluation]] Committee published its report and declared in a news conference that US$5 billion, including $400 million the Kabul Bank’s shareholders, were illegally transferred abroad. About 22 people are accused of embezzlement in the case, and their trial started. At three hearings, 18 people, including Sher Khan Farnood and Khalil Ferozi, appeared before the court to defend themselves. Some $935 million of the bank assets was transferred abroad through various systems and $825 million are needed to bail out the bank. The Afghan government will have to pay 5-6% of its GDP to save the bank, which would be a huge blow to the country’s economy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Billions of Dollars Sent Illegally Abroad from Kabul Bank|url=http://www.satrapia.com/news/article/billions-of-dollars-sent-illegally-abroad-from-kabul-bank/|newspaper=The Gazette of Central Asia|date=28 November 2012|publisher=Satrapia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2011, the Karzai Government has rejected banking oversight and reform efforts by the United States in the wake of the Kabul Bank scandal and collapse according to reports by the U.S. [[Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction]] (SIGAR) in 2013-14.&lt;ref&gt; U.S. Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction (SIGAR) Audit Report, January 2014, "Afghanistan's Banking Sector: Central Banks Ability to Regulate Commercial Banks Remains Weak" http://www.sigar.mil/pdf/audits/SIGAR%2014-16-AR.pdf &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/newshour/rundown/afghan-central-banks-fragile-state-increases-risk-of-new-banking-crisis-audit-finds/|title=Afghan central bank's 'fragile state' increases risk of new banking crisis, audit finds|website=PBS NewsHour|publisher=2014-01-08|language=en-US|access-date=2016-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.stripes.com/news/report-afghan-banking-authority-rejects-u-s-help-1.261194|title=Report: Afghan banking authority rejects U.S. help|last=Standifer|first=Cid|date=2014-01-09|website=Stars and Stripes|access-date=2016-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Banking experts, economists and humanitarian aid officials have expressed serious concern about this development given Kabul Bank's large and historic dependence on U.S. taxpayers' funding of bank deposits via payments of the Afghan National Army soldiers, police and Afghanistan's civil service employees who are largely paid with billions of dollars in U.S. aid to the Karzai government and to Afghanistan from the U.S. Congress, U.S. Treasury and ultimately U.S. taxpayer. 

The U.S. government has found anti-corruption efforts in Afghanistan in the wake of the Kabul Bank crisis as deeply troubling, including the banking sector, according to reports by the Washington Post in 2012 and SIGAR. &lt;ref&gt; DeYoung, Karen, Washington Post, 11 December 2012,  "U.S. finds Afghan anti-corruption efforts ‘deeply troubling" https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/us-finds-afghan-anti-corruption-efforts-deeply-troubling/2012/12/11/e0c57b80-43b3-11e2-8061-253bccfc7532_story.html &lt;/ref&gt;

===2014 murder of IMF official and executive sentences===

In January 2014, the International Monetary Fund's (IMF) representative Wabel Abdallah, who assisted in the Kabul Bank crisis aftermath, was murdered by suicide bombers and gunmen in Kabul along with some 21 others in a high profile attack that the Taliban said they undertook. &lt;ref&gt;  Donati, Jessica,  Reuters,18 January 2014, "IMF, U.N. officials among 21 killed in Kabul suicide attack" http://in.reuters.com/article/2014/01/18/afghanistan-explosion-idINDEEA0G0D020140118&lt;/ref&gt; Abdallah headed the IMF's office in Afghanistan since 2008.

Following the departure of Afghanistan's President Hamid Karzai in 2014, President [[Ashraf Ghani]] re-opened efforts to bring former Kabul Bank officials involved in the Kabul Bank Crisis to justice, extend and enforce prison sentences for those previously convicted, and seek to recover hundreds of millions of U.S. and Afghan taxpayers' dollars in funds stolen or lost by [[embezzlement]], [[corruption]], and [[fraud]] by the bank's insiders. &lt;ref&gt; Deutsche Welle (DW), Germany, (3 October 2014) "New probe into Kabul Bank scandal an 'important symbolic act'" http://dw.de/p/1DP2T &lt;/ref&gt;  Ghani vowed to seek to continue the investigation of the Kabul Bank crisis and fight [[corruption in Afghanistan]].  In October 2014, the Ghani Administration in Kabul reportedly officially re-opened the investigation.&lt;ref&gt; British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC), (1 October 2014), "Kabul Bank fraud: Ghani reopens Afghan corruption case" https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-29450821&lt;/ref&gt;

===New company===

After corruption and scandals it was re-established in 2011 as the New Kabul Bank.

In 2011, 38 customers at the bank's branch in Jalalabad were killed by a Taliban bombing.&lt;ref name="Washington Post"/&gt; Fighting with security forces lasted four hours, and four of the attackers were killed. Two men were later charged for the attack and executed in June 2011. A third person was sentenced to prison.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cnn.com/2011/WORLD/asiapcf/06/20/afghanistan.bank.attack.executions/index.html&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2010, the Afghan Central Bank said it was prepared to provide loans to the Kabul Bank, "if it requests".&lt;ref&gt;https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/afghanistan/7984515/Kabul-Bank-gets-Afghan-bail-out.html&lt;/ref&gt; After the bailout by the government, by 2015, authorities were inviting bids to privatize the new bank.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.reuters.com/article/us-afghanistan-bank/afghan-government-cancels-property-deal-with-convicted-banker-idUSKCN0SW0O820151107&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, Afghanistan's Joint-Stock Company offered to buy New Kabul Bank for $31 million.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-07-28/afghan-firm-offers-31-million-to-buy-defrauded-new-kabul-bank&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pakistan]]'s [[MCB Bank]] also made a bid, as New Kabul Bank was to be privatized in October 2018.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-04-06/pakistan-s-mcb-bank-in-race-to-buy-afghanistan-s-new-kabul-bank&lt;/ref&gt;
 
In April 2015, the Islamic State or an associated group claimed responsibility for a suicide bombing at the entrance of a New Kabul Bank branch in [[Jalalabad]], where government workers waited in line to collect salaries. 34 people were killed at least, and 125 injured.&lt;ref name="Washington Post"&gt;https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/dozens-killed-in-suicide-bomber-attack-outside-an-afghanistan-bank/2015/04/18/3849f572-e59f-11e4-b510-962fcfabc310_story.html?noredirect=on&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2017, a Taliban suicide bomber killed 29 people at a Kabul Bank branch in the Helmand province.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/kabul-bank-bombing-1.4266303&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2017, there were reports of long lines and slow services at the New Kabul Bank branch in the [[Paktika province]], where it was the only bank in the region.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.pajhwok.com/en/2017/08/21/paktika-residents-unhappy-new-kabul-bank-services&lt;/ref&gt; That month, a suicide bomber targeted the Kabul Bank branch entrance close to the US embassy, resulting in five reported deaths. The Taliban claimed responsibility.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2017/08/suicide-bomber-targets-kabul-bank-branch-170829073843771.html&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Parallel Education''' is a system in which boys and girls in Australia attend the same school, but are split into [[Gender segregation|single sex]] classes for core subjects such as [[English language|English]], [[Maths]], [[science]], [[LOTE]], and [[humanities]]. However, [[student]]s will come together for [[drama]], [[music]] and other social and cultural activities although a strict 30&amp;nbsp;cm personal space rule applies. Theoretically, this means that students will receive the best education while still being able to interact with the opposite sex. {{Citation needed|date=February 2009}}

[[Haileybury College, Melbourne]] currently operates Parallel Education at their five campuses with many other leading schools set to follow.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5608">'''Participation bias''' or '''non-response bias''' is a phenomenon in which the results of [[elections]], [[Research|studies]], [[Opinion poll|polls]], etc. become non-representative because the participants disproportionately possess certain traits which affect the outcome. These traits mean the sample is systematically different from the target population, potentially resulting in biased estimates.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://methods.sagepub.com/book/survey-research-methods|title=Survey Research Methods (4th ed.) - SAGE Research Methods|last=Fowler|first=Floyd|language=en|doi=10.4135/9781452230184}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

For instance, a study found that those who refused to answer a survey on [[AIDS]] tended to be "older, attend church more often, are less likely to believe in the confidentiality of surveys, and have lower sexual self disclosure."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1G1-54128117.html|title=Participation Bias in AIDS-Related Telephone Surveys: Results From the National AIDS Behavioral Survey (NABS) Non-Response Study.}}&lt;/ref&gt; It may occur due to several factors as outlined in [[W. Edwards Deming|Deming]] (1990).&lt;ref&gt;Deming, W. Edwards. Sample design in business research. Vol. 23. John Wiley &amp; Sons, 1990.&lt;/ref&gt;

Non-response bias can be a problem in [[Longitudinal study|longitudinal research]] due to [[Attrition bias|attrition]] during the study.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/887254158|title=Research methods in health : Investigating health and health services|last=Ann|first=Bowling|publisher=|year=|isbn=9780335262755|location=Milton Keynes|pages=|oclc=887254158}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Example ==
If one selects a sample of 1000 managers in a field and polls them about their workload, the managers with a high workload may not answer the survey because they do not have enough time to answer it, and/or those with a low workload may decline to respond for fear that their supervisors or colleagues will perceive them as surplus employees (either immediately, if the survey is non-anonymous, or in the future, should their anonymity be compromised). Therefore, non-response bias may make the measured value for the workload too low, too high, or, if the effects of the above biases happen to offset each other, "right for the wrong reasons."  For a simple example of this effect, consider a survey that includes, "Agree or disagree: I have enough time in my day to complete a survey."

In the [[United States presidential election, 1936|1936 U.S. presidential election]], ''[[The Literary Digest]]'' mailed out 10 million questionnaires, of which 2.3 million were returned.  Based on this, they predicted that Republican Alf Landon would win with 370 of 531 electoral votes;  he actually got 8.   [[United States presidential election, 1936#Camaign|Research published in 1976 and 1988]] concluded that [[Survey sampling#Bias in probability sampling|non-response bias]] was the primary source of this error, although their [[sampling frame]] was also quite different from the vast majority of voters.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
Non responders have been shown to be associated with younger patients, poorer communities and those who are less satisfied and subsequently could be a source of bias by a study published by Imam et al. in 2014.{{Citation needed|date=March 2018}}

== Test ==
There are different ways to test for non-response bias. A common technique involves comparing the first and fourth quartiles of responses for differences in demographics and key constructs.&lt;ref name="Armstrong &amp; Overton 1977"&gt;
{{cite journal
  |last1=Armstrong|first1=J.S.
  |last2=Overton|first2=T.
  |year=1977
  |title=Estimating Nonresponse Bias in Mail Surveys
  |journal=Journal of Marketing Research
  |volume=14
  |issue=3
  |pages=396–402
  |doi=10.2307/3150783
}}&lt;/ref&gt; In e-mail surveys some values are already known from all potential participants (e.g. age, branch of the firm, ...) and can be compared to the values that prevail in the subgroup of those who answered. If there is no significant difference this is an indicator that there might be no non-response bias.

In e-mail surveys those who didn't answer can also systematically be phoned and a small number of survey questions can be asked. If their answers don't differ significantly from those who answered the survey, there might be no non-response bias.  This technique is sometimes called non-response follow-up.

Generally speaking, the lower the [[Response rate (survey)|response rate]], the greater the likelihood of a non-response bias in play.

==Related terminology==
*[[Self-selection bias]] is a type of bias in which individuals voluntarily select themselves into a group, thereby potentially biasing the response of that group.
*[[Response bias]] is not the opposite of non-response bias, but instead relates to a possible tendency of respondents to give inaccurate or untruthful answers for various reasons.

Progressive Jewish Alliance expanded in February 2005 by opening a San Francisco Bay Area chapter. The PJA stated goals are [[social justice]], judicial reform, and improved working conditions. They also try to facilitate dialogue between non-violent [[young offenders]] and their victims and between Jews and [[Muslim]]s.

PJA ran the Jeremiah Fellowship, which trains young Jews to be future social justice leaders. In addition, the PJA conducted education programs and quarterly holiday events on the intersection of art, culture and politics.

The '''Momogun Rungus''' are an [[ethnic group]] of [[Borneo]], residing primarily in northern [[Sabah]] in the area surrounding [[Kudat]]. A sub-group of the [[Kadazan-Dusun]], they have a distinctive language, dress, architecture, customs, and [[oral literature]].

==Subsistence==
As with most indigenous ethnic groups in Borneo, culture revolves around [[rice]]; however, [[coconut]] and [[banana]] groves provide cash income. Women weave cloth on [[backstrap loom]]s, and make containers from vine or beadwork. Many Rungus now work in town, and have abandoned the communal life of the longhouse for modern Malaysian society. Traditionally [[animist]], with female [[shaman]]s, most Rungus are now [[Christian]].

==Longhouses==
[[File:GiantRungusBumbuIkan.jpg|thumb|left|A large ceremonial ''bumbu ikan'' (fish trap) in a Rungus village in [[Kudat]], [[Sabah]] in [[Borneo]]. A longhouse can be seen in the background, with distinct outward-sloped walls.]]

Considered one of the most traditional ethnic groups in Sabah, many Momogun Rungus live in [[longhouse]]s, with each family having its own separate quarters off a common hall. At the edge of the communal hall, a well-ventilated platform of split [[bamboo]] with outward sloping walls provides a place for socialising and communal work. The Rungus longhouse is quite different from the [[Murut people|Murut]] longhouse. The houses are not perched on high stilts, but are usually only three to five feet above ground. The roof is low, and the walls are outward sloped. In olden times, longhouses of over 75 doors are said to have been common. Now, they rarely exceed 10 doors. Usually single story, more modern two-story versions of the longhouse also exist. Single-family houses are sometimes built near the longhouse – these take the same form, but are curiously short, looking like a slice from a cake.

==Dress==
The traditional Rungus dress is black in colour, often with hundreds or even thousands of dollars worth of antique [[beads]]. Traditionally all of the Rungus women wore heavy [[brass]] coils around their arms, legs and necks. Brass arm coils are often accompanied by white and [[coral]] shell bracelets. Rings of brass may also be worn around the waist.

===Beadwork===
This beadwork and its designs easily distinguish the Rungus from the other ethnic groups of Sabah. "The beadwork often tells a story and this one in particular tells of a man going spear-hunting for a riverine creature".&lt;ref name="CCATOSM"&gt;{{cite book|editor=Irene Benggon-Charuruks &amp; Janette Padasian|title=Cultures, customs, and traditions of Sabah, Malaysia: an introduction|year=1993|publisher=Sabah Tourism Promotion Corporation|isbn=98-302-0000-0|page=14}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''pinakol'' consists of a pair of flat beaded bandoleer-type belts worn crossed over the chest and back.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor=Rita Lasimbang &amp; Stella Moo-Tan|contribution=Patricia Regis &amp; Jabatan Muzium dan Arkib Negeri Sabah|title=An Introduction to the Traditional Costumes of Sabah|year=1997|publisher=Natural History Publications|isbn=98-381-2013-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''sandang'' is a pair of long beaded strands, mostly with matching beads. These are worn crossed over the chest like the ''pinakol''.
The ''sullau'' is a flat beaded choker worn around the neck with two clamshell discs, one in front and one in back. Small bells are attached in the front. They make the discs out of plastic nowaday The ''tinggot'' is a short choker, either single beaded or with narrow beadwork. Men and women wear these.
The ''togkul'' is a necklace some 26&amp;nbsp;inches (66&amp;nbsp;cm) long with beads similar to the ''sandang'' but smaller and worn around the neck.
The ''sisingal'' is a narrow beaded band worn around the head.
The ''rampai'' is made of cotton, flowers and beads worked into the hair.
The ''orot''. "Little brass rings and antique beads looped through thin strands of stripped bark ''(togung)'' becomes a wide and colorful hipband. To wear this the ''orot'' is slowly and carefully coiled around the hip. Then a last string of beads ''(Llobokon)'' is hung loosely from the coil. The ''orot'' is hand made by the Rungus men as the technique is known only to them".&lt;ref name="CCATOSM"/&gt;

The ''bobolizan'' originates with the Tuaran Lotud group of Sabah, but according to Rose Sabala sometimes Rungus wear ''bobolizan'' to talk to spirits in the old language.

There are also ''sad'ang'', earrings that sometimes have beads attached.

Many of the beads used by the Rungus are plastic and glass imitations of older heirloom beads. Materials such as plastic spoons were heated over a flame and the hot plastic are then winded onto a metal rod to make yellow beads.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thebeadsite.com/rungus04.htm |author=Bucklee Bell |title=Beads and Beadwork of the Rungus of Sabah (Part Four: Other Ornaments) |publisher=The Bead Site |accessdate=2017-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cuisine==
[[File:Sikuati Sabah Rungus-Ladies-01.jpg|thumb|right|Three Rungus ladies selling home-produced products in Sikuati Town, [[Sabah]], [[Malaysia]].]]
Rungus cuisine is mainly prepared using cooking methods like braising, grilling and baking. Being a community of fishermen and farmers, the staple foods of the Rungus people usually consists of rice and cassava, supplemented with green vegetables and fish.  

''Tinunuvan soguntung'' is the Rungus term for a preparation of grilled or roasted eggplant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ww2.sabah.gov.my/lbk/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=151&amp;Itemid=536 |title=Indentiti Dan Budaya |publisher=Lembaga Bandar Kudat |accessdate=2017-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cooked eggplant is peeled, and served with chillies, lime juice, toasted ikan bilis or salted fish, and sprigs of ''lompodos'' (a local variety of [[basil]]).   

''Tinonggilan'' is a slightly sparkling alcoholic drink made from [[maize]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.flyingdusun.com/004_Features/001_Rungus.htm |author=Herman |title=The Rungus: The Art of Blending Traditional Life-Style into the 20th Century |publisher=The Flying Dusun Sdn Bhd |year=2000 |accessdate=2017-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Akin to the Latin American [[corn beer]], ''Tinonggilan'' is a [[Rungus]] speciality and is usually served during festive occasions, or as refreshments for guests during the performance of a ritual dance called ''Mongigol Sumundai''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kosmo.com.my/kosmo/content.asp?y=2015&amp;dt=0115&amp;pub=Kosmo&amp;sec=Rencana_Utama&amp;pg=ru_01.htm |author=Mohd Yunus Yakkub |title=Rungus Kudat kaya budaya |publisher=Kosmo! |year=2015 |accessdate=2017-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Rungus also prepare simple sweet foods such as flatbread made from sweetened grated cassava (''tinopis runti'') and ''bintanok dalai'', or mashed corn wrapped and steamed in corn husks. These are to be consumed for breakfast or as snacks.    

==Festival==
Like the [[Kadazan-Dusun]], Rungus people also celebrate [[Kaamatan]]. This festival is usually celebrated on 31 May every year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Puay Liu Ong|title=Packaging Myths for Tourism: The Rungus of Kudat|year=2008|publisher=Penerbit Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia|isbn=96-794-2826-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even though there are many similarities the way of celebration between this two race but there is also comparison.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7720">The '''Safe Campus Act''' ({{USBill|114|H.R.|3403}}) was introduced to the [[United States House of Representatives|US House of Representatives]] by [[Matt Salmon]] (R-AZ), [[Pete Sessions]] (R-TX), and [[Kay Granger]] (R-TX) on July 29, 2015.&lt;ref name="Fraternity Groups"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kingkade|first1=Tyler|title=Fraternity Groups Push Bills To Limit College Rape Investigations|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/fraternity-groups-college-rape_55c10396e4b0e716be074a7f|accessdate=18 October 2015|work=Huffingtonpost.com|publisher=The Huffington Post|date=4 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bill aims to prevent colleges from pursuing internal investigations in cases of [[campus sexual assault]].&lt;ref name="28 Groups"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kingkade|first1=Tyler|title=28 Groups That Work With Rape Victims Think The Safe Campus Act Is Terrible|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/rape-victims-safe-campus-act_55f300cce4b063ecbfa4150b|accessdate=18 October 2015|publisher=The Huffington Post|date=13 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This restriction would legally require alleged victims of [[sexual assault]] to report the crime to the police in order to see justice on campus.&lt;ref name="28 Groups" /&gt;

==Major provisions==
===Reporting to law enforcement===
The Safe Campus Act would require schools to report each allegation of sexual violence to local law enforcement for investigation after obtaining written consent from the alleged victim.  Schools would be required to wait for the results of a law enforcement investigation before beginning their own internal disciplinary procedures and would not be allowed to punish the accused in cases where the alleged victim did not consent to a law enforcement investigation.  In cases where deemed necessary to protect the safety of the alleged victim, schools would be permitted to impose interim measures such as temporary suspensions, no contact orders, adjustments to class schedules, and changes in housing assignments.  These interim measures would be lifted after the completion of the law enforcement investigation if it did not result in an indictment.  Alleged victims would have the right to submit a joint request with law enforcement for interim measures if both agreed that they would not protect the safety of the alleged victim, and schools would be required to honor such a request.  Students would be protected from being disciplined for violations of school rules that came to light as a result of their reporting of sexual violence.

===Due process===
The Safe Campus Act would require a formal hearing before students could be disciplined for sexual violence.  Schools would be required to provide all parties with at least two weeks notice before the hearing.  Both the accused and the alleged victim would have the right to an attorney at their own expense, the right to access all evidence, and the right to cross-examination, although such cross-examination would be prohibited from including any questions on the sexual history of the alleged victim.  Schools would be required to ensure that those adjudicating allegations do not have conflicts of interest.  Students who are found responsible for sexual violence would have the right to judicial review of that decision.  Schools would be required to publish their procedures for adjudicating allegations of sexual violence in their student handbooks.

=== Sexual Violence Education ===
The Safe Campus Act requires universities to educate all adult and student staff on sexual assault and reporting.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/house-bill/3403/text|title=Safe Campus Act of 2015|last=Salmon|first=Matt|date=29 July 2015|website=Congress.gov|publisher=Library of Congress|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also encourages but does not require the university to provide sexual assault education to the students.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Universities must allocate funds to these programs and for programs to help victims of sexual assault on campus.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Criticism==
The provision requiring an alleged victim to report an act of sexual violence to law enforcement before the accused student could be punished has generated controversy.

=== Opponents ===
The bill's opponents point to low reporting rates in cases of sexual assault and insist forced reporting to the police will inhibit even more victims from coming forward as victims of a sexual crime.&lt;ref name="Fraternity Groups"/&gt; Opponents also point out that this bill singles out sexual assault crimes, as colleges can still punish students with other accusations, even without a criminal investigation.&lt;ref name="28 Groups"/&gt; Some of the most outspoken opponents of this bill are the [[National Panhellenic Conference]] and the [[North-American Interfraternity Conference|North American Inter-fraternity Conference]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2015/11/forcing-colleges-to-involve-police-in-sexual-assault-investigations/416736/|title=Forcing Colleges to Involve Police in Sexual-Assault Investigations?|last=Bishop|first=Tyler|date=19 November 2015|website=The Atlantic|publisher=The Atlantic|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== The Fair Campus Act ====

The Fair Campus Act was introduced shortly after the Safe Campus Act as a response to the criticism of the Safe Campus Act.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/phi-mu-alpha-gamma-delta-safe-campus-act_us_5645f573e4b045bf3deead24|title=Several Sororities Back Away From Safe Campus Act|last=Editor/Reporter|first=Tyler Kingkade Senior|last2=Post|first2=The Huffington|date=2015-11-13|website=The Huffington Post|access-date=2016-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; This bill is very similar but does not require sexual assault victims to report to the police in order for there to be a college investigation, which was the main issue for the opponents of the Safe Campus Act.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/house-bill/3408/text|title=The Fair Campus Act of 2015|last=Sessions|first=Pete|date=16 November 2015|website=Congress.gov|publisher=Library of Congress|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Supporters ===
Supporters of this bill claim mandatory police reporting will ensure students have access to fair representation during a trial, which may not be the case in a campus hearing, as it does not have criminal implications without the police.&lt;ref name="Fair hearing"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Svruluga|first1=Susan|title=Do students get a fair hearing?

'''Sex segregation''' is the physical, legal, and cultural separation of people according to their biological sex.

In certain circumstances, sex segregation is controversial.&lt;ref&gt;Salomone, Rosemary C. "Are Single-Sex Schools Inherently Unequal? Same, Different, Equal: Rethinking Single-Sex Schooling." "Michigan Law Review." 102(6):1219-1244&lt;/ref&gt; Some critics contend that it is a violation of capabilities and [[human rights]] and can create economic inefficiencies, while some supporters argue that it is central to certain religious laws and social and cultural histories and traditions.&lt;ref name="World Bank 2012"&gt;The World Bank. 2012.

==Definitions==
The term "sex" in "sex segregation" refers to apparent biological distinctions between men and women, used in contrast to "gender".&lt;ref name="Cohen 2010"&gt;Cohen, David S. 2010. "The Stubborn Persistence of Sex Segregation." ''Columbia Journal of Gender and Law'' forthcoming 2010&lt;/ref&gt; The term "segregation" refers to separation of the sexes, which can be enforced by rules, laws, and policies, or be a ''[[de facto]]'' outcome in which people are separated by sex. Even as a de facto outcome, "sex segregation" taken as a whole can be caused by societal pressures, historical practices, and socialized preferences. Literally, sex segregation can be physical and spatial separation by sex, but the term is also used for the exclusion of one sex from participation in an occupation, institution, or group. Sex segregation can be complete or partial, as when members of one sex predominate within, but do not exclusively constitute, a group or organization.&lt;ref name="Cohen 2010"/&gt;

The term [[gender apartheid]] or (sexual apartheid) also has been applied to segregation of people by gender,&lt;ref name=clergy&gt;{{Cite news|title=Women clergy accuse Church of sexual apartheid|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk_news/story/0,3604,580180,00.html |newspaper=The Guardian |publisher=Guardian Unlimited | location=London | first=Stephen | last=Bates | date=October 25, 2001 | accessdate=May 23, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; implying that it is [[sexual discrimination]].&lt;ref name=Otto&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Otto D |title=Holding Up half the Sky, But For Whose Benefit: A Critical Analysis of the Fourth World Conference on Women |journal=Austl Feminist LJ. |month= |year=1996 |volume=7 |issue= |pages= |url=http://heinonlinebackup.com/hol-cgi-bin/get_pdf.cgi?handle=hein.journals/afemlj6&amp;section=6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Insofar as sex segregation is a form of sex discrimination, its effects have important consequences for [[gender equality]] and equity.&lt;ref name="Cohen 2010"/&gt;

[[File:Men not allowed.jpg|thumb|A sign mandating sex segregation on a women's only car in India.]]

==Types==

Sex segregation can occur in both public and private contexts, and be classified in many ways. Legal and [[gender studies]] scholar David S. Cohen offers one taxonomy in categorizing sex segregation as mandatory, administrative, permissive, or voluntary. Mandatory and administrative sex segregation are required and enforced by governments in public environments, while permissive and voluntary sex segregation are stances chosen by public or private institutions, but within the capacity of the law.&lt;ref name="Cohen 2010"/&gt;

===Mandatory===

Mandatory sex segregation is legally required and enforces separation based on sex.&lt;ref name="Cohen 2010"/&gt; Examples include separation of men and women in prisons, law enforcement, military service, restrooms, and housing. These mandatory rules can be nuanced, as in military service, where sexes are often separated in laws about conscription, in housing, and in regulations on which sexes can participate in certain roles, like frontline infantry.&lt;ref name="Cohen 2010"/&gt;  Mandatory sex segregation also includes less obvious cases of separation, as when men and women are required to have same-sex attendants for body searches. Mandatory sex segregation can thus dictate parameters for employment in sex segregated spaces, including medical and [[care work]] contexts,  and can be a form of [[occupational segregation]].&lt;ref name="Cohen 2010"/&gt; For example, a government may mandate that clinics hire female nurses to care for female patients.

===Administrative===

Administrative sex segregation involves public and government institutions segregating by sex in their operating capacity, rather than as the result of a formal mandate.&lt;ref name="Cohen 2010"/&gt; Examples of administrative sex segregation include sex segregation in government sponsored medical research, sports leagues, public hospitals with shared rooms, rehabilitation programs, and some public education facilities. Administrative sex segregation can occur in these environments simply as through the provisioning of sex segregated restrooms despite limited explicit legal requirements to do so.&lt;ref name="Cohen 2010"/&gt;

===Permissive===

Permissive sex segregation is segregation which is explicitly permitted by law, i.e. affirmatively authorized, but not necessarily legally required or encouraged.&lt;ref name="Cohen 2010"/&gt; Permissive sex segregation exempts certain things from anti-[[sex-discrimination]] laws, often allowing for, among others, segregation of religious and military schools, undergraduate schools that have traditionally admitted based on sex, health clubs, athletic teams, social fraternities and sororities, choirs and choruses, voluntary youth service organizations such as the [[Girl Scouts of the USA|Girl Scouts]] and [[Boy Scouts of America|Boy Scouts]], father/son and mother/daughter activities, and sex-exclusive beauty pageants and scholarships.&lt;ref name="Cohen 2010"/&gt;

===Voluntary===

Sex segregation that is neither legally mandated, nor enacted in an administrative capacity, nor explicitly permitted by law, is recognized as voluntary sex segregation.&lt;ref name="Cohen 2010"/&gt; Voluntary sex segregation refers to lack of explicit legal prescriptions; it does not necessarily indicate the free choice of either the segregated or the segregators, and it may be imposed by social and cultural norms. Voluntary sex segregation takes place in numerous national professional and interest-based membership organizations, local and larger clubs, professional sports teams, private recreational facilities, religious institutions, performing arts, and more.&lt;ref name="Cohen 2010"/&gt;

==Theoretical explanations==
Within [[feminist theory]] and [[feminist legal theory]], there are six main theoretical approaches that can be considered and used to analyze the causes and effects of sex segregation. They include libertarianism, equal treatment, difference feminism, anti-subordination, critical race feminism, and anti-essentialism.&lt;ref name="Cohen 2010"/&gt;

===Libertarianism===
{{main article|Libertarianism}}
[[Individualist feminism|Libertarian feminist]] theory stems from ideologies similar to libertarian political theory; that legal and governmental institutions should not regulate choices and should allow people's free will to govern their life trajectories.&lt;ref&gt;Barnett, Randy E. 1998. "The Structure of Liberty: Justice and the Rule of Law".&lt;/ref&gt; Libertarianism takes a [[free market]] approach to sex segregation saying that women have a natural right and are the most informed to make decisions for themselves but rejects special protections specifically for women.&lt;ref&gt;Posner, Richard. 1989. "Conservative Feminism". University of Chicago Legal F.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Autonomy]] is central to libertarianism, so theorists believe that the government should not interfere with decision making or be concerned with reasoning behind such decisions since men and women culturally and naturally make different and often diverging choices. Policies and laws enforced by the government should not act to change any inherent differences between the sexes.&lt;ref name="Cohen 2010"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Epstein, Richard A. 1999. "Liberty, Patriarchy, and Feminism." University of Chicago Legal F (89).&lt;/ref&gt; 
Libertarianism most directly relates to voluntary sex segregation as it maintains that the government should not regulate private institutions or entities' segregation by sex and should not regulate how individuals privately group themselves.&lt;ref name="Cohen 2010"/&gt; Libertarian feminist David Berstein argues that while sex segregation can cause harm, guarding the freedom of choice for men and women is more important than preventing such sex segregation since methods of prevention can often cause more harm than good for both sexes. Women's health clubs are an example of how sex segregation benefits women since desegregation would interfere with women's abilities to exercise without the distraction of men and 'ogling' without any direct benefit to allowing men a membership.&lt;ref&gt;Bernstein, David E. 1999. "Sex Discrimination Laws Versus Civil Liberties" University of Chicago Legal F (133).&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, libertarians would allow for permissive sex segregation since it allows people to choose how to organize their interactions and relationships with others.&lt;ref name="Cohen 2010"/&gt;
Libertarian feminists acknowledge that there is legal precedence for sex segregation laws, but argue for such parameters to ensure equal treatment of similarly situated men and women. As such, libertarianism could allow or reject specific forms of sex segregation created to account for natural or biological differences between the sexes.&lt;ref&gt;Warnick, Ashlie. 2003. "Women: Freedom and Feminism in the Twenty-First Century." edited by Wendy McElroy.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Equal treatment===
{{main article|Egalitarianism|Equal opportunity}}
Equal treatment theory or formal equity often works in tandem with libertarianism in that equal treatment theorists believe governments should treat men and women similarly when their situations are similar.&lt;ref&gt;MacKinnon, Catharine A. 2007. "Sex Equality." 5.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Halley 2007"&gt;Halley, Janet. 2007. "Split Decisions: How and Why to Take a Break From Feminism." 79.&lt;/ref&gt; In countries whose governments have taken to legislation eliminating sex segregation, equal treatment theory is most frequently used as support for such rules and regulation.&lt;ref name="Chamallas 2003"&gt;Chamallas, Martha. 2003. "Introduction to Feminist Legal Theory." 35.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, equal treatment theory was adopted by the many feminists during the United States' feminist movement in the 1970s. This utilization of equal treatment theory led to the adoption of [[intermediate scrutiny]] as a standard for sex discrimination on the basis that men and women should be treated equally when in similar situations.&lt;ref name="Chamallas 2003"/&gt; While equal treatment theory provides a sound framework for equality, application is quite tricky, as many critics question the standards by which men and women should be treated similarly or differently.&lt;ref name="Halley 2007"/&gt; In this manner, libertarianism and equal treatment theory provide good foundations for their agendas in sex segregation, but conceptually do not prevent it, leaving room for mandatory and administrative sex segregation to remain as long as separation is based on celebrated differences between men and women. Some forms of mandatory and administrative segregation may perpetuate sex segregation by depicting a difference between male and female employees where there is no such difference, as in combat exclusion policies.&lt;ref name="Cohen 2010"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;McSally, Martha. 2007. "Women in Combat: Is the Current Policy Obsolete?" Duke Judicial Gender Law and Policy 1011:14&lt;/ref&gt;

===Difference feminism===
{{main article|Difference feminism}}
Difference feminism arose from libertarianism and equal treatment theories' perceived failure to create systemic equality for women. Difference feminism celebrates biological, psychological, moral differences between men and women, accusing laws concerning sex segregation of diluting these important differences.&lt;ref&gt;Levit, Nancy and Robert R. M. Verchick. 2006. "Feminist Legal Theory: A Primer." 8.&lt;/ref&gt; Difference feminists believe that such laws not only ignore these important differences, but also can exclude participation of women in the world. Difference feminism's goal is to bring about a consciousness of women's femininity and to cause the revaluation of begin to revalue women's attributes in a more respectful, reverent manner.&lt;ref name="Halley 2007"/&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Difference feminism and equal treatment theory are quite contrasting feminist theories of sex segregation. Difference feminism often justifies sex segregation through women's and men's differences while equal treatment theory does not support separation because of differences in sex. Difference feminism, however, argues against segregation that stems from societal and "old-fashioned" differences between men and women, but believes that segregation that takes women's differences into account and promotes equality is acceptable, even going so far as to say that some forms of sex segregation are necessary to ensure equality, such as athletics and education, and policies such as Title IX.&lt;ref name="Cohen 2010"/&gt;

===Anti-subordination===
Anti-subordination feminist theory examines sex segregation through power to ultimately whether women are treated or placed subordinately compared to men in a law or situation.&lt;ref name="Cohen 2010"/&gt; The theory focuses on male dominance and female subordination and promotes destroying a sex-based hierarchy in legal and social institutions and preventing future hierarchies from arising.&lt;ref&gt;MacKinnon, Catharine. 1987. "Feminism Unmodified: Discourses on Life and Law." 40.&lt;/ref&gt; Anti-subordination also supports laws that promote the status of women even if they lower men's status as a consequence.&lt;ref&gt;Colker. 1986. "Anti-Subordination Above All: Sex, Race, and Equal Protection." NYU Law Review. 61(1003).&lt;/ref&gt; Controversial applications of anti-subordination that can either perpetuate the subordination of women or create the subordination of men include sex segregation in education and in the military.&lt;ref&gt;Epstein, Cynthia F. 1997. "The Myths and Justifications of Sex Segregation in Higher Education: VMI and The Citadel." Duke Gender Law and Pol'y 101:1475-76.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Critical race feminism===
{{main article|Critical race theory}}
Critical race feminism developed due to the lack of racial inclusivity of feminist theories and lack of gender inclusivity of racial theories.&lt;ref name="Wing, Adrien Katherine 2003"&gt;Wing, Adrien Katherine. 2003. Introduction to "Critical Race Feminism: A Reader" ed. Adrien Katherine Wing.&lt;/ref&gt; This theory is more global than the others, attempting to take into account the intersectionality of gender and race. Critical race feminism demands that theorists reexamine surface-level segregation and focus on how sex segregation stems from different histories, causing different effects based on race, especially for&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Perpetual Minors|url=https://www.hrw.org/en/reports/2008/04/19/perpetual-minors|website=Human Rights Watch|accessdate=June 6, 2017|date=April 19, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; women of color. This segregation is evident in many racially divided countries, especially in the relationship between the end of race-segregated schools and sex segregation.&lt;ref name="Cohen 2010"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mayeri, Serena. 2006. "The Strange Career of Jane Crow: Sex Segregation and the Transformation of Anti-Discrimination Discourse" Yale Judiciary Law and Humanities 187(257):338.&lt;/ref&gt; Critical race feminism critiques other theories' failure to take into account their different applications once race, class, sexual orientation, or other identity factors are included in a segregated situation.&lt;ref&gt;Harris, Angela P. 1990. "Race and Essentialism in Feminist Legal Theory." Stanford Law Review 42:581-590.&lt;/ref&gt; It creates the need to examine mandatory and administrative sex segregation to determine whether or if they sustain racial stereotypes, particularly towards women of color. Additionally, critical race feminists wonder whether permissive and voluntary sex segregation are socially acceptable manners by which to separate races and sexes or whether they maintain and perpetuate inequalities.&lt;ref name="Cohen 2010"/&gt; Critical race feminism is a form of anti-essentialism (below).&lt;ref name="Wing, Adrien Katherine 2003"/&gt;

===Anti-essentialism===
Anti-essentialists maintain that sex and gender categories are limiting and fail to include the unlimited variety of difference in human identity and impose identities rather than simply note their differences.&lt;ref&gt;Frug, Mary J. 1992. "Postmodern Legal Feminism." 18.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Levit, Nancy. 1996. "Feminism for Men: Legal Ideology and the Construction of Maleness." UCLA Law Review 1037(1050).&lt;/ref&gt; Theorists believe that there is variation in what it means to be a man and what it means to be a woman, and by promoting the differences through sex segregation, people are confined to categories, limiting freedom.&lt;ref name="Cohen 2010"/&gt; Anti-essentialists examine how society imposes specific identities within the sex dichotomy and how subsequently sex and gender hierarchies are created, perpetuated, and normalized.&lt;ref name="Cohen 2010"/&gt; This theory requires that there is a specific disentanglement between sex and gender.&lt;ref&gt;Valdés, Francisco. 1995. "Queers, Sissies, Dykes, and Tomboys: Deconstructing the Conflation of "Sex," "Gender," and "Sexual Orientation" in Euro-American Law and Society." California Law Review 83(1).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Case, Mary Anne. 1998. "Unpacking Package Deals: Separate Spheres Are Not the Answer." Denver University Law Review 75 (1305, 1317).&lt;/ref&gt; Anti-essentialists believe that there should not be an idea of what constitutes masculinity or femininity, but that individual characteristics should be fluid to eliminate sex and gender-based stereotypes.&lt;ref&gt;Cho, Sumi and Robert Wesley. 2000. "Critical Race Coalitions: Key Moments that Performed the Theory." 33 (1377, 1416).&lt;/ref&gt; No specific types of sex segregation are outwardly promoted or supported by anti-essentialists since mandatory and administrative sex segregation reinforce power struggles between the sexes and genders while permissive or voluntary forms of sex segregation allow institutions and society to sort individuals into categories with differential access to power, and supporting the government's elimination of such permission for certain institutions and norms to continue to exist.&lt;ref&gt;Cohen, David S. 2009. "No Boy Left Behind? Single-Sex Education and the Essentialist Myth of Masculinity" Indiana Law Journal 84(135).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contemporary policy examples==

Sex segregation is a global phenomenon manifested differently in varying localities.&lt;ref&gt;Grusky, David B., and Maria Charles. 2001. "Is There a Worldwide Sex Segregation Regime?" Pp. 689-703 in Social Stratification: Class, Race, and Gender in Sociological Perspective (Second Edition), edited by David B. Grusky. Boulder: Westview Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Sex segregation and integration considered harmless or normal in one country can be considered radical or illegal in others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gubernskaya|first1=Zoya|title=Attitudes toward Cohabitation in 28 Countries: Does Marital Status Matter?|url=http://paa2008.princeton.edu/papers/80851|website=Princeton|accessdate=June 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  At the same time, many laws and policies promoting segregation or desegregation recur across multiple national contexts. Safety and privacy concerns, traditional values and cultural norms, and belief that sex segregation can produce positive educational and overall social outcomes all shape public policy regarding sex segregation.

===Safety and privacy===

Some sex segregation occurs for reasons of safety and privacy. Worldwide, laws often mandate sex segregation in bathrooms, locker rooms, showers, and similar spaces, based on a common perceived need for privacy.&lt;ref name="Cohen 2010"/&gt; This type of segregation policy can protect against [[sexual harassment]] and [[sexual abuse]].&lt;ref name="Amnesty International USA"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.amnestyusa.org/document.php?id=ENGACT770232007&amp;lang=e |publisher=Amnesty International USA |title=Six Steps to Stop Violence Against Schoolgirls |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090624214051/http://www.amnestyusa.org/document.php?id=ENGACT770232007&amp;lang=e |archivedate=June 24, 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; To combat [[groping]], [[street harassment]], and [[eve teasing]] of women in crowded public places, some countries have also designated [[women only space]]s. For example, sex-segregated buses, [[women-only passenger car]]s, and compartments on trains have been introduced in [[Mexico]], [[Japan]], the [[Philippines]], the [[United Arab Emirates|UAE]] and other countries to reduce sexual harassment.&lt;ref name="Marc Lacey"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/02/11/world/americas/11mexico.html|title=On Single-Sex Buses, Relief From Unwanted Contact|publisher=New York Times|author=Marc Lacey|work=Mexico City Journal|date=February 11, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| title =Belarus rail targets 'smelly men' | url =http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4439735.stm | accessdate = June 11, 2008 | work=BBC News | date=April 13, 2005 | first=Tatyana | last=Nechapayka}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="mainichi-disability"&gt;{{Cite news

Sex segregation rooted in safety considerations can furthermore extend beyond the physical to the psychological and emotional as well. A refuge for battered mothers or wives may refuse to admit men, even those who are themselves the victims of domestic violence, both to exclude those who might commit or threaten violence to women and because women who have been subjected to abuse by a male might feel threatened by the presence of any man.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/society/2009/apr/05/domestic-violence-charity-funding |publisher=The Guardian|title=Women's refuges told they must admit men | location=London | first=Gaby | last=Hinsliff | date=April 5, 2009 | accessdate=May 23, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Women's health clinics and women's resource centers, whether in [[Africa]] or [[North America]], are further examples of spaces where sex segregation may facilitate private and highly personal decisions. [[Women-only bank]]s may be similarly intended to provide autonomy to women's decision making.

===Religious and cultural ideas===

Sex segregation can also be motivated by religious or cultural ideas about men and women. Such cultural assumptions may even exist in the aforementioned policies enacted under the pretenses of safety or privacy concerns. [[gender separation in Judaism|Gender separation and segregation in Judaism]] and [[gender segregation and Islam|Islam]] reflect religiously motivated sex segregation. In [[women in Buddhism|Buddhism]], [[Christian feminism|Christianity]], and [[women in Hinduism|Hinduism]], [[monastic orders]], prayer spaces, and leadership roles have also been segregated by sex.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Status of Women in World Religions {{!}} PROUT Globe|url=http://www.proutglobe.org:80/2011/05/the-status-of-women-in-world-religions/|website=ProutGlobe|accessdate=June 6, 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120320004720/http://www.proutglobe.org/2011/05/the-status-of-women-in-world-religions/|archivedate=March 20, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From a policy perspective, [[theocracy|theocracies]] and countries with a [[state religion]] have sometimes made sex segregation laws based partially in religious traditions. Even when not legally enforced, such traditions can be reinforced by social institutions and in turn result in sex segregation. In the [[South Asia]]n context, one institution conducive to sex segregation, sometimes but not always rooted in national law, is [[purdah]].&lt;ref&gt;Asha, S. "Narrative Discourses on Purdah in the Subcontinent." ICFAI Journal of English Studies 3, no. 2 (June 2008): 41–51&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Western Wall Entrance.jpg|thumb|A sex-segregated entrance to the [[Western Wall]], a religious site in [[Jerusalem]].]]

During the [[Taiping Rebellion]] (1851-64) against the [[Qing dynasty]], areas controlled by the [[Taiping Heavenly Kingdom]] had strict sex separation enforced. Even married couples were not allowed to live together until 1858.

The [[Muslim world]] and the [[Middle East]] have been particularly scrutinized by scholars analyzing sex segregation resulting from the consequences of [[Sharia]], the moral and religious code of Islam that, in the strictest version, Muslims hold to be the perfect law created by God. [[Saudi Arabia]] has been called an epicenter of sex segregation, stemming partially from its conservative [[Sunni]] Islamic practices and partially from its monarchy's legal constraints.&lt;ref name="Meiher 2013"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Meiher|first1=Roel|title=Reform in Saudi Arabia: The Gender-Segregation Debate {{!}} Middle East Policy Council|url=http://www.mepc.org/journal/middle-east-policy-archives/reform-saudi-arabia-gender-segregation-debate|website=www.mepc.org|accessdate=June 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Sex segregation in Saudi Arabia]] is not inherent to the country's culture, but was promoted in the 1980s and 1990s by the government, the Sahwa movement, and conservative and religious behavioral enforcers (i.e. police, government officers, etc.).&lt;ref name="Meiher 2013"/&gt; 
Israel has also been noted both for its [[women in the military by country|military draft of both sexes]] and its sex-segregated [[Mehadrin bus lines]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jwa.org/encyclopedia/article/equality-religion-and-gender-in-israel|title=Equality, Religion and Gender in Israel - Jewish Women's Archive|website=jwa.org|accessdate=June 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Education and socialization===
{{See also|Mixed-sex education#Effects of coeducation|l1=Effects of coeducation|Single-sex education#Effects of single-sex education|l2=Effects of single-sex education}}

Sex segregation is sometimes pursued through policy because it is thought to produce better educational outcomes. In some parts of the world, especially in Europe, where education is available to girls as well as boys, educational establishments were frequently single-gender. Such [[single-sex education|single-sex schools]] are still found in many countries, including but not limited to, [[Australia]], the United Kingdom, and the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scotch.vic.edu.au/ |title=Scotch College |date= |accessdate=October 8, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ichs.org.uk/ |title=Ilford County High School |date= |accessdate=October 8, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States in particular, two federal laws give public and private entities permission to segregate based on sex: Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and Title IX of the Educational Amendments of 1972.&lt;ref name="Cohen 2010"/&gt; These laws permit sex segregation of contact sports, choruses, sex education, and in areas such as math and reading, within public schools.&lt;ref name="Cohen 2010"/&gt;

[[File:PS116 girls door.jpg|thumb|The girls' entrance to a school; the boys use or used an equivalent door.]]

Studies have analyzed whether [[single-sex education|single-sex]] or [[Mixed-sex education|co-ed schools]] produce better educational outcomes. Teachers and school environments tend to be more conducive to girls' learning habits and participation rates improve in single-sex schools.&lt;ref&gt;Bauch, P.A. 1988.

Critics of single-sex schools and classes claim that single-sex schooling is inherently unequal and that its physical separation contributes to gender bias on an academic and social basis. Single-sex schooling also limits the socialization between sexes that co-educational schools provide. Coeducational school settings have been shown to foster less anxiety, have happier classrooms, and enable students to participate in a simulated social environment with the tools to maneuver, network, and succeed in the world outside of school.&lt;ref&gt;Dale, R.

[[Parallel education]] occurs in some schools, when administrators decide to segregate students only in core subjects.&lt;ref&gt;Horne, Donald, Susan Mardsen, Alison Painter. 1993.

Segregation by specialization is also evident in higher education and actually increases with economic development of a country.&lt;ref name="WDR 2012"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://econ.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/EXTDEC/EXTRESEARCH/EXTWDRS/EXTWDR2012/0,,menuPK:7778074~pagePK:7778278~piPK:7778320~theSitePK:7778063~contentMDK:22851055,00.html|title=WDR 2012 - WDR 2012 Home Page|website=econ.worldbank.org|accessdate=June 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cambodia]], [[Lao People's Democratic Republic]], [[Morocco]], and [[Namibia]] are countries with the least amount of gender segregation in tertiary studies while [[Croatia]], [[Finland]], Japan, and [[Lithuania]] have the most.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = WDR 2012 - WDR 2012 Home Page|url = http://econ.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/EXTDEC/EXTRESEARCH/EXTWDRS/EXTWDR2012/0,,menuPK:7778074~pagePK:7778278~piPK:7778320~theSitePK:7778063~contentMDK:22851055,00.html|website = econ.worldbank.org|accessdate = November 12, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Desegregation===

Desegregation policies often seek to prevent [[sex discrimination]], or alleviate [[occupational segregation]]. These policies encourage women and men to participate in environments typically predominated by the opposite sex. Examples include [[women in government|government quotas]], gender-specific scholarships, co-ed recreational leagues, or programming designed to change social norms.

In China, deputies to the National People's Congress and members of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference National Committee proposed that the public should be more attentive to widespread instances of occupational segregation in China. Often employers reject specifically women applicants or create sex requirements in order to apply. The [[Labour Contract Law of the People's Republic of China]] and Law of the People's Republic of China on the Protection of Rights and Interests of Women state that no employer can refuse to employ women based on sex or raise application standards for women specifically, but also do not currently have clear sanctions for those who do segregate based on sex.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=CWDF Distributes Postal Parcels to Female Sanitation Workers - All China Women's Federation|url=http://www.womenofchina.cn/html/womenofchina/report/150514-1.htm|website=www.womenofchina.cn|accessdate=June 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
China has also begun to encourage women in rural villages to take up positions of management in their committees. Specifically, China's Village Committee Organization Law mandates that women should make up one third or more of the members of village committees. The Dunhuang Women's Federation of Dunhuang City, in China's Gansu Province, provided training for their village's women in order to build political knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ruizhen|first1=Gu|last2=Ren|first2=Qinqin|title=China to Send Another Female Astronaut to Space - All China Women's Federation|url=http://www.womenofchina.cn/html/womenofchina/report/150548-1.htm|website=www.womenofchina.cn|accessdate=June 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2013 in the European Union, a resolution was passed to invest in training and professional development for women, promote women-run businesses, and include women on company boards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Poverty has a female face: economic crisis hits women hardest {{!}} News {{!}} European Parliament|url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/en/pressroom/content/20130308IPR06303/html/Poverty-has-a-female-face-economic-crisis-hits-women-hardest|website=Europarl|accessdate=June 6, 2017|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130412163815/http://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/en/pressroom/content/20130308IPR06303/html/Poverty-has-a-female-face-economic-crisis-hits-women-hardest|archivedate=April 12, 2013|deadurl=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Israel, the Minister of Religious Services, Yaakov Margi Shas, has recently supported removal of signs at cemeteries segregating women and men for eulogies and funerals, prohibiting women from taking part in the services. The Minister agreed with academic and politician, Yesh Atid MK Aliza Lavie, who questioned him about segregation policies enacted by rabbis and burial officials, that governmental opposition to sex segregation was necessary to combat these practices not supported by Jewish or Israeli law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Miskin|first1=Maayana|title=Shas Minister: Gender Segregation a Problem|url=http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/165686#.UUc15XATv-k|website=Israel National News|accessdate=June 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In other cases, sex segregation in one arena can be pursued to enable sex desegregation in another. For example, separation of boys and girls for early math and science education may be part of an effort to increase the representation of [[women in engineering]] or [[women in science]].

Sometimes, countries will also argue that segregation in other nations violates [[human rights]]. For example, the United Nations and Western countries have encouraged kings of Saudi Arabia to end its strict segregation of institutions such as schools, government institutions, hospitals, and other public spaces in order to secure [[women's rights in Saudi Arabia]]&lt;ref&gt;Le Renard, Amélie. 2008. "'Only for Women': Women, the State and Reform in Saudi Arabia," Middle East Journal,  62(4):610–629.&lt;/ref&gt; Even though the removal of certain religious and government heads has made way for liberal agendas to promote desegregation, the public largely still subscribes to the idea of a segregated society, while institutions and the government itself still technically remain under the control of [[Wahhabism]]. Reform is small in size, since there is no constitution to back up policy changes concerning sex segregation. The Saudi people refer to this segregation as [[khalwa]] and violation of the separation is punishable by law. This separation is tangibly manifested in the recently erected wall in places that employ both men and women, a feat possible by a law passed in 2011 allowing Saudi women to work in lingerie shops in order to lower female unemployment rates. The public views the 1.6 meter wall favorably, saying that it will lead to less instances of harassment by men visiting the expatriate women in the shops.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Nikolas|first1=Katerina|title=Saudi Arabia orders shops to build sex segregation walls|url=http://www.digitaljournal.com/article/342355|website=DigitalJournal|accessdate=June 6, 2017|date=January 29, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Luthan hotel in Saudi Arabia was the country's first women's only hotel, acting more as a vacation spot for women than a mandated segregated institution. Upon entering the hotel, women are allowed to remove their headscarves and [[abaya]]s and the hotel employs only women, calling their bellhops the world's first bellgirls, providing opportunities for Saudi women in IT and engineering jobs where, outside the Luthan, are quite scarce.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Middle East - Creating a woman's world in Arabia|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/7922279.stm|website=news.bbc.co.uk|accessdate=June 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Significance==

===In human development ===
{{main article|Capability approach}}
For most children, sex segregation manifests itself early in the socialization process via [[socialization|group socialization theory]], where children are expected to behave in certain sex-typed manners and form sex in and out-groups.&lt;ref&gt;Rose, Amanda J. and Karen D. Rudolph. 2006. "A Review of Sex Differences in Peer Relationship Processes: Potential Trade-offs for the Emotional and Behavioral Development of Girls and Boys." Psychological Bulletin 132(1):98-131.&lt;/ref&gt; In pre-school classrooms, for example, making gender more salient to children has been shown to lead to stronger gender stereotypes and intergroup biases between sex groups. These evident tendencies were also manifested in decreased playtime with children of the opposite sex, or a kind of early, selective sex segregation based on preconceived social norms.&lt;ref&gt;Hilliard, Lacey J. and Lynn S. Liben. 2010. "Differing Levels of Gender Salience in Preschool Classrooms: Effects on Children's Gender Attitudes and Intergroup Bias" Child Development (81)6:1787-1798.&lt;/ref&gt; While specifically segregating by sex for playtime has not been linked to any long-lasting effects on women's rights compared to men, these different manners of socialization often lead to communication and power struggles between men and women and to differential life decisions by each sex based on these long-established gendered identities.&lt;ref&gt;Leaper, Cambell. 1994. "Exploring the Consequences of Gender Segregation on Social Relationships." New Directions for Child Development 65:67-86.&lt;/ref&gt;

In elementary and secondary education, sex segregation sometimes yields and perpetuates gender bias in the form of treatment by teachers and peers that perpetuates traditional [[gender role]]s and sex bias, underrepresentation of girls in upper level math, science, and computer classes, fewer opportunities for girls to learn and solve problems, girls receiving less attention compared to the boys in their classes, and significantly different performance levels between boys and girls in reading and math classes. Sometimes in elementary schools teachers force the students to sit boy, girl, boy girl. Sex segregation in educational settings can also lead to negative outcomes for boys such as boys in coeducational classrooms having academic scores higher than boys in single-sex classrooms. On the contrary, girls in single-sex classrooms have academic scores higher than girls in co-educational classrooms. Boys academically benefit from a coeducational environment while girls do from a single-sex environment, so critics and proponents of both types of education argue that either single-sex or coeducational classrooms create a [[comparative advantage|comparative disadvantage]] for either sex.&lt;ref&gt;American Association of University Women. 1998.

A special case presents with choirs and choruses, especially in the tradition of the [[choir school]] which uses ensemble and musical discipline to ground academic discipline. Male and female voices are distinctive both solo and in ensemble, and segregated singing has an evolved and established aesthetic. Male voices, unlike female voices, break in early adolescence, and accommodating this break in an educational program is challenging in a coed environment. Coeducation tends to stigmatize males, as is often the case in expressive arts, unlike athletics.

{{main article|Occupational segregation}}
Physical sex separation is not popular in many institutions on a tertiary level (between types of institutions), while fields of study or majors are highly gendered, such as later life decisions such as work/care work conflicts. Men tend to occupy engineering, manufacturing, science, and construction fields while women dominate education, humanities and arts, social sciences, business, law, and health and welfare fields.&lt;ref name="World Bank 2012"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Charles, Maria and Karen Bradley. 2002. "Equal but Separate? A Cross-National Study of Sex Segregation in Higher Education" American Sociological Review 67(4):573-599.&lt;/ref&gt; However, important life decisions as occupations can yield other instances of sex segregation by impacting [[occupational segregation|occupational sex imbalances]] and further male and female [[socialization]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=BBC NEWS {{!}} UK {{!}} Scotland {{!}} Action call over sex segregation|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/scotland/4281423.stm|website=news.bbc.co.uk|accessdate=June 6, 2017|date=February 21, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vicki Schultz (1990) indicates that although [[Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964]] prohibits sex discrimination in employment and promised working women change, "most women continue to work in low paying, low status, and traditionally female jobs." Schultz (1990) states that "employers have argued that women lack interest in male-dominated jobs, which are highly rewarded and nontraditional for women." According to Schultz, the courts have accepted this argument, subsequently not holding employers liable. Schultz contends that "the courts have failed to recognize the role of employers in shaping women's work aspirations." (Schultz, 1990:1750,1756)&lt;ref name="Schultz, Vicki 1990"&gt;Schultz, Vicki.(1990). Telling Stories about Women and Work: Judicial Interpretations of Sex Segregation in the Workplace in Title VII Cases Raising the Lack of Interest Argument Author(s): Harvard Law Review, Vol. 103, No. 8 (Jun. 1990), pp. 1749-1843 Published&lt;/ref&gt;) Schultz states that the judicial framework that has been established by the courts "has created an unduly narrow definition of sex discrimination and an overly restrictive role for the law in dismantling sex segregation." (Schultz, 1990:1757)&lt;ref name="Schultz, Vicki 1990"/&gt; Schultz concludes by saying, "courts can acknowledge their own constructive power and use it to help create a work world in which women are empowered to choose the more highly rewarded occupations that Title VII has long promised."  (Schultz, 1990:1843)&lt;ref name="Schultz, Vicki 1990"/&gt; Even at psychological levels, socialized preferences for or against sex segregation can also have significant effects. In one study, women in male-dominated work settings were the most satisfied psychologically with their jobs while women in occupational settings with only 15-30% men were less satisfied due to favored treatment of the male minority in such a segregated atmosphere.&lt;ref&gt;Wharton, Amy S. and James N. Baron. 1991. "Satisfaction? The Psychological Impact of Gender Segregation on Women at Work" The Sociological Quarterly 32(3):365-387.&lt;/ref&gt; Stark segregation by occupation can lead to a sexual division of labor, influencing the access and control men and women have over inputs and outputs required for labor. Additionally, occupational sex segregation has certain health and safety hazards for each sex, since employment conditions, type of work, and contract and domestic responsibilities vary for types of employment. In many areas of work, women tend to dominate the production line jobs while men occupy managerial and technical jobs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tools and publications - Safety and health at work - EU-OSHA|url=https://osha.europa.eu/en/faq/women-and-health/what-are-the-consequences-of-gender-segregation-in-occupations|website=osha.europa.eu|accessdate=June 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; These types of workplace factors and interactions between work and family have been cited by social stratification research as key causes for social inequality. Family roles are especially influential for predicting significant differences in earnings between married couples. Men benefit financially from family roles such as a husband and a father, while women's incomes are lowered when becoming a wife and mother.&lt;ref name="Witkowski, Kristine M 1995"&gt;Witkowski, Kristine M. and Kevin T. Leicht. 1995. "The Effects of Gender Segregation, Labor Force Participation, and Family Roles on the Earnings of Young Adult Workers." Work and Occupations 22:48.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other gender disparities via sex segregation between men and women include differential asset ownership, house and care work responsibilities, and agency in public and private spheres for each sex.&lt;ref name="Witkowski, Kristine M 1995"/&gt; These segregations have persisted because of governmental policy, blocked access for a sex, and/or the existence of sex-based societal gender roles and norms. Perpetuation of gender segregation, especially in economic spheres, creates market and institutional failures. For example, women often occupy jobs with flexible working environments in order to take on [[care work]] as well as job responsibilities, but since part-time, flexible hourly jobs pay less and have lower levels of benefits, large numbers of women in these lower income jobs lowers incentives to participate in the same market work as their male counterparts, perpetuating occupational gender lines in societies and within households.&lt;ref name="World Bank 2012"/&gt; Schultz (1990) article indicates that "working-class women have made it a priority to end job segregation for they want opportunities that enable them to support them and their families." (Schultz, 1990:1755)&lt;ref name="Schultz, Vicki 1990"/&gt; Additionally, economic development in countries is positively correlated with female workers in wage employment occupations and negatively correlated with female workers in unpaid or part-time work, self-employment, or entrepreneurship, job sectors often seen occupied by women in developing countries.&lt;ref name="World Bank 2012"/&gt; Many critics of sex segregation see globalization processes as having the potential to promote systemic equality among the sexes.&lt;ref name="World Bank 2012"/&gt;

'''Solombala-English''', or '''Solombala English–Russian Pidgin''', is a little-known [[pidgin]], derived from both [[English language|English]] and [[Russian language|Russian]], that was spoken in the port of [[Solombala]] in the neighborhood of [[Arkhangelsk]] (Archangel), [[Russia]] in the 18th and 19th centuries.

The known Solombala-English corpus consists of only two short 19th-century texts: one in ''Очерки Архангельской губерний'' (Sketches from the district of Archangel) by Vasilij Vereščagin from 1849, and one in ''Архангельские Губернские Ведомости'' (Archangel District News) from 1867.

The '''Stolero-Yachman-Chachkes affair''' ([[Hebrew language|Hebrew]]: פרשת סטולרו-יכמן-צ'צ'קס, ''Parshat Stolero-Yachman-Chachkes'') refers to a series of three unsolved murders that took place in [[Israel]] in the early 1960s. The murders, which were never solved, aroused a great deal of public interest, and due to similarities between them, they are widely speculated to have been the work of a [[serial killer]] or Soviet intelligence.

==The murders==
Between November 1962 and July 1963, three murders took place in central Israel. The victims were not connected, but each case showed similar parallels. In each murder, the killer, who had no apparent motive, gunned down the victims with an [[Uzi]] submachine gun, then immediately fled the scene and was not caught.

===Moshe Stolero===
[[File:Moshe Stolero Murder Scene.jpg|thumb|The murder scene of Moshe Stolero]]
The first victim was Moshe Stolero, a 32 year old disabled man, who owned a household goods, book, and newspaper store in [[Ramat Gan]], and lived with his parents in an apartment in an apartment on Hachayal Street, in the same building where his store was located. On November 15, 1962, at around 7:00&amp;nbsp;PM, after Stolero had closed and locked up his shop and was returning home, a gunman fired at him with an Uzi as he was in the stairwell of the building. Stolero was hit three times and killed. The fact that the murder was not committed as part of a robbery attempt and nothing was stolen from his store led police to conclude that the murderer's sole intention was to kill Stolero.&lt;ref name=maariv&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.maariv.co.il/news/israel/Article-547240|title=מעריב &amp;#124; רצח מן העבר: חזרה ל-3 מקרי הרצח שהסעירו את המדינה בשנות ה-60|website=maariv.co.il|accessdate=2017-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Shmuel Yachman===
The second victim was Dr. Shmuel Yachman, an internal physician in [[Tel Aviv]] who provided medical services to the US Embassy in Israel. Yachman, who was born in [[Germany]] as Siegfried Yachman, lived at 12 Mazeh Street. He was murdered on the night of April 2, 1963. Yachman and his wife Sarah were returning home from a concert, when at the entrance to their home, he was killed by a single shot to the neck from an Uzi. The killer immediately fled without leaving a trace.&lt;ref name=maariv/&gt;

===Deborah Chachkes===
The third victim was Deborah Chachkes, who lived with her family in a small house near an orchard on the outskirts of [[Kfar Saba]]. In the early morning hours of July 17, 1963, a man entered their home and fired several shots from an Uzi at Deborah and her husband Fishel as they slept. Deborah was killed and Fishel was seriously injured. The murderer again escaped.&lt;ref name=maariv/&gt;

==Public reaction==
The fact that three mysterious murders had taken place within nine months, all without apparent motive, carried out with the same type of weapon, and in which the murderer managed to escape without leaving a trace, caused panic among the public as the media struggled to find an explanation. Due to the fact that Deborah Chechkes had visited the [[Soviet Union]] to see her sick mother two years before, and that Dr. Yachman provided services to the US Embassy, conspiracy theories about the involvement of Soviet intelligence were proposed.&lt;ref name=maariv/&gt;

===Levy Neufeld affair===
At around the same time, a 19-year-old medical student at the [[Hebrew University of Jerusalem]] named Levy Neufeld left his home and disappeared without a trace. Neufeld had survived the [[The Holocaust|Holocaust]] as a toddler together with his brother Yehuda, and the two brothers had been adopted by a couple from [[Ramat Gan]]. Neufeld was an outstanding student, but as his final exams approached, he began to suffer from mental problems prior to his disappearance. After he had been gone for two weeks, his family reported him missing to police. Police then decided that there was a high probability that Neufeld committed the murders. A nationwide manhunt was launched in which over 1,000 police officers were involved.&lt;ref name=mako&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mako.co.il/hix-history/Article-d8a019dde60ab51006.htm|website=mako.co.il|title=יש לנו ארץ מוזרה: סקס, שקרים ופולה בן גוריון|accessdate=2017-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was presented to the public as a dangerous person, and it was speculated that psychological damage brought on by the trauma of the Holocaust had driven him to kill.&lt;ref name=maariv/&gt; The press accused him of the murders, which led to the poetess [[Zelda (poet)|Zelda]] sending a letter of protest to ''[[Haaretz]]'', accusing the press of baselessly accusing him without trial and comparing the media frenzy to a lynch mob.&lt;ref name="ynet"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ynet.co.il/articles/0,7340,L-3590564,00.html|title=ynet דברי המשוררת - אנציקלופדיה|website=ynet.co.il|accessdate=2017-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="haaretz"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.haaretz.co.il/1.1412354|title=ודמי הדחוס משחיר - שירה - הארץ|website=haaretz.co.il|accessdate=2017-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 3, 1964, Neufeld was found dead by a group of youths in an abandoned building in the [[Ein Kerem]] neighborhood of [[Jerusalem]]. A suicide note and bottle of poison were found next to his body. A pathological examination of his body found that the time of his death preceded two of the three murders.&lt;ref name=maariv/&gt;

==Allegations Soviet involvement==
It was speculated at the time that the murders may have been linked to Soviet involvement due to Chachkes' previous visit to the Soviet Union and Yachman's services to the US Embassy, although no explanation for why the Soviets would have wanted to kill Stolero was offered. In October 2012, Avraham Chachkes, the son of Deborah Chachkes, was interviewed by the Israeli newspaper ''[[Yediot Ahronoth]]'', and claimed that his father Fishel had been active in organizing the escape of Soviet Jews who wanted to leave the country, and continued working for Israeli intelligence after his arrival in Israel. He speculated that his mother had been followed after her visit to the Soviet Union, and claimed that his father was the killer's actual target. Avraham claimed to have spoken with Israeli Prime Minister [[David Ben-Gurion]] himself over the matter, and said that Ben-Gurion had told him the killer was a Soviet agent who had since left the country.&lt;ref name=mako/&gt; [[Isser Harel]], the former Director-General of the [[Mossad]], denied the killer was a Soviet spy.

'''Urak Lawoi’''' is an [[Aboriginal Malay]] language of southern Thailand.

The Orang (Suku) Laut who live between [[Sumatra]] and the [[Malay Peninsula]] speak divergent Malayic lects, which bear some intriguing connections to various Sumatran Malay varieties.&lt;ref&gt;[http://wwwstaff.eva.mpg.de/~gil/ismil/16/abstracts/Anderbeck.pdf Anderbeck, Karl (2012).

'''Warsaw Fire Guard''' ({{lang-pl|Warszawska Straż Ogniowa}}) was a [[fire fighting]] unit in the city of [[Warsaw]]. Formed as Warsaw's first permanent fire service in 1834, it remained an independent and city-owned venture until its nationalization by the Nazi German authorities during the occupation of Poland following the [[Invasion of Poland]] of 1939.

==History==

The Warsaw Fire Brigade was created on December 23, 1834, by the Administrative Council of the [[Congress Poland|Kingdom of Poland]]. It was to be modeled after a similar fire-fighting unit created in [[Saint Petersburg]] only a year earlier. On February 6 of the following year Lt. Colonel Jan Robosz became the first Fire Chief of Fire Guard in Warsaw. The organization of the unit ended on January 1, 1836, and it began its duty. Initially named Fire Guard in Warsaw (Straż Ogniowa w Warszawie), in 1841 it was renamed to Warsaw Fire Guard (Warszawska Straż Ogniowa). The Guard was entitled with all maintenance duties in the city, including putting down fires and [[fire prevention]], but also cleaning the [[chimney]]s and the streets. It was divided onto four departments, each of them responsible for a different borough of Warsaw. In 1851 an additional department was created for the borough of [[Mirów (Warsaw)|Mirów]]. In 1864 the Guards received the first [[steam engine]]-operated mobile pump, manufactured by a [[London]]-based ''[[Shand Mason|F. Shand, Mason and Co.]]'' firm. The following year two additional vehicles arrived, thus making the Warsaw Fire Guard one of the best-equipped fire units in continental Europe. The Guards also assisted in a number of experiments, among them in the tests of a [[carbonic acid]] [[fire extinguisher]] in 1869.

As the car was damaged, the fuel was pumped directly from its container.]]

Although the Guards remained largely independent even after the failed [[January Uprising]] against [[Russia]], the death of Col. [[Urban Majewski]] in 1872 marked the end of much of its independence. His successor as the commander of the Guards, Col. Ivan Anienkov, was a Russian and, in accordance with Russian policy of [[Russification]] of Poland, until [[World War I]] all commanders of the Guards were also Russians. In 1887 the Guards form a ''Fire Brigade Band''; with time it became one of the notable parts of the folklore of the firefighting units in Poland. Even {{As of|2006|lc=on}} most of the fire fighting units have their own [[orchestra]]s. In 1878, president of Warsaw [[Sokrat Starynkiewicz]] ordered a new building for the Guards' headquarters, the first such building constructed in Poland specifically for the needs of the firefighters. Throughout its existence, the Guard usually followed the technical development and introduction of new equipment. In 1906 the guards were equipped with [[asbestos]] protective gear, as the first firefighting unit in the [[Russian Empire]]. In 1911 the first mobile ladder made by the [[Magirus]] company arrived, and in 1914 the Guards leased the first automobile, a van manufactured in the [[Büssing]] company.

After the outbreak of World War I, the Guards continued their service. However, in July 1915 the Russians ordered the evacuation of Warsaw and most of the Guards, along with their equipment. Some of them served in Russian cities, most notably [[Minsk]], [[Moscow]] and [[St. Petersburg]]. However, many of them escaped from the Russians and return to the [[Central Powers]]-occupied city. Among them is [[Józef Tuliszkowski]], who on September 4 was named the commander of the guards. In 1916 the first automobile built exclusively for the firefighters was purchased from the [[Hans Lloyd]] company. The same year the citizens of Warsaw sponsored a banner for the Guards, to mark the 80th anniversary of their creation.

After the end of World War I, Poland regained her independence and the pre-war commander of I and IV departments, Capt. [[Józef Hłasko]], returned to Warsaw from [[Moscow]] (where he served as the commander of that city's firefighters) and became the successor of Tuliszkowski. In 1920, during the [[Polish-Bolshevik War]], the Polish Ministry of Interior decided to nationalize the unit. However, the authorities of Warsaw have sued the state authorities and the decision was withdrawn. Until [[World War II]] the Warsaw Fire Guards were the only privately owned fire brigade in Poland and one of the very few such units in the world. Officially their status was similar to that of the Municipal Police. The private ownership (most of the shares were held by the city of Warsaw) allowed for fast modernization of the Guards. In 1928 the last horse-drawn cart was decommissioned; since then the Guard has been fully motorized. In 1936 a new headquarters was built at Polna street, where one of the branches is located even now.

In 1939, after the outbreak of the [[Invasion of Poland]], by orders of one of the military commanders, the Warsaw Fire Guard was withdrawn from Warsaw to [[Lublin]]. However, many firefighters ignored the orders and stayed in Warsaw, where their continued their service during the hard days of the [[Siege of Warsaw (1939)|siege of Warsaw]], extinguishing fires in dramatic conditions, often during German bombardment. Along with their colleagues evacuated from [[Łódź]], [[Brzeziny]], [[Ozorków]] and [[Nieszawa]], they continued their service until the capitulation of Warsaw. Altogether, the Warsaw firefighters lost 30 men and 50 wounded during the fights.

After the start of the German occupation of Poland, the Warsaw Fire Guard was officially nationalized by the Nazis. However, the unit remained largely independent and in December 1939 most of the firefighters joined a newly formed [[Skała]] resistance organization, with time incorporated into the [[Armia Krajowa]]. Most of the firefighters took part in the Warsaw Uprising of 1944, where their experience and commitment proved vital in stiffening the resistance of the besieged city under constant bombardment. On an interesting note, one of the self-propelled pumps of the Warsaw Fire Guard was used as a flamethrower during the heavy fights for the PAST building. The last commander of the Warsaw Fire Guards was Col. [[Adam Kalinowski]]. After the war the Allied-backed communist authorities of Poland did not re-create the Guards and instead formed a local branch of the state-owned firefighters unit.

==Stamp==
A 10-zloty [[postage stamp]] was issued in 1986 to commemorate the Brigade's 150th anniversary. It featured a painting by [[Józef Brodowski the Younger|Józef Brodowski]] of the brigade's horse-drawn carriages on their way to a fire in 1870.

'''Youth Intervention''' programs are community based services work with young people when they are first beginning to make poor decisions that can have lifelong negative repercussions.  The goal of Youth Intervention programs is to encourage and build a young person's connections to the community, 
including developing meaningful relationships with caring adults, as a way to support academic achievement, as well as prevent juvenile delinquency.

Youth Intervention providers work with young people to help them become engaged and contributing members of the community. Typically, Youth Intervention programs work with young people between 6 and 18 years of age, but may also work with young people between 18 and 24 years of age.

While often viewed as a way to prevent young people from becoming involved in the [[juvenile justice system]] or avoid committing a re-offense, Youth Intervention has a broader impact. It is a way to work with young people who are struggling in school and may choose to drop out or are making choices that can lead to teen pregnancy or illegal use of alcohol and other substances, and also works with youth who are homeless and may find themselves in unsafe situations forcing them to make harmful choices.

Poor decision making or engaging in negative behaviors that can lead to interaction with the juvenile justice system can often be a symptom of an underlying problem. Causation factors can include unaddressed mental and emotional health struggles, unhealthy family environments and relationships, as well as stress and [[Adverse Childhood Experiences Study|adverse childhood experiences (ACES)]]&lt;ref name="acestudy"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.acestudy.org|title=Health Presentations - Home|publisher=acestudy.org|accessdate=2016-03-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; related to poverty.

With the wide variety of challenges that can leading to poor decision making, Youth Intervention encompasses a broad array of program approaches. Youth Intervention includes: pre court diversion, [[restorative justice]], mental and chemical health counseling, mentoring, out of school time programs, transitional housing for young people who are homeless, as well as programs that promote employability. The membership of the Youth Intervention Programs Association (YIPA) reflects the diverse approaches used in Youth Intervention.&lt;ref name="yipa."&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yipa.org|title=Home - YIPA|publisher=yipa.org|accessdate=2016-03-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With a focus on prevention, measuring the impact of Youth Intervention is challenging. It is difficult to document that a behavior did not occur as a result of the Youth Intervention Program. However, research specific to Youth Intervention programs in Minnesota shows these programs to be effective in reducing truancy and improving school performance. They also result in reduced court costs, a reduced need for social services by the youth and/or family and improved health outcomes.&lt;ref name="Anton 2007"&gt;Anton, Paul and Temple, Judy (2007) Analyzing the Social Return on Investment in Youth Intervention Programs: A framework for Minnesota. St. Paul. MN&lt;/ref&gt; The estimated cost per youth for Youth Intervention is $1,000 to $5,000 per year depending on the type of service. The study also estimated that quality Youth Intervention programs result in $4.80 of benefits per dollar spent on the program.&lt;ref name="Anton 2007"/&gt;

Youth Intervention produces positive outcomes at a much lower price than incarceration in a juvenile correction facility. Studies show that 70% to 80% of youth who are incarcerated are likely to re-offend.&lt;ref name="aecf.org"&gt;Annie E. Casey Foundation, No Place for Kids, 2011, page 12; http://www.aecf.org/m/resourcedoc/aecf-NoPlaceForKidsFullReport-2011.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Studies also that for youth committing less serious offenses, incarceration is associated with an increased likelihood of re-offending upon release.&lt;ref name="aecf.org"/&gt; And these poor outcomes have a high price. According to the [http://www.justicepolicy.org Justice Policy Institute], it costs $407.58 per youth per day to be confined to a juvenile corrections facility. This can amount to as much as $148,767 per youth per year.&lt;ref&gt;"What Youth Incarceration Costs Taxpayers, U.S. News and World Report, December 9, 2014; https://www.usnews.com/news/blogs/data-mine/2014/12/09/what-youth-incarceration-costs-taxpayers&lt;/ref&gt;

Underpinning Youth Intervention is [[Positive Youth Development]], which centers on providing young people with positive experiences, positive relationships and positive environments.&lt;ref&gt;8 Youth.Gov, Positive Youth Development; http://youth.gov/youth-topics/positive-youth-development&lt;/ref&gt; To implement these three factors within a program requires programs to adhere to best practices. This includes having adults who work with young people in these settings to be highly skilled and knowledgeable about youth development. What is clear is that to build resiliency, young people need a web of support that includes parents, teachers and adults in the community.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.educationweek.org, "High School Students Need "Webs" of Supportive Adults, Study Says, 9/16/2015; http://blogs.edweek.org/edweek/high_school_and_beyond/2015/09/high_school_students_need_webs_of_supportive_adults.html?cmp=SOC-EDIT-FB&lt;/ref&gt; Adults working in Youth Intervention programs are part of that needed web of support.

The most successful Youth Intervention programs prevent the delinquent or harmful behavior from occurring. But documenting how a program led to a youth not engaging in a behavior is difficult to measure.

Both the [[National Research Council (United States)|National Research Council]] and the [[Institute Of Medicine|Institute of Medicine]] state that prevention and early intervention is typically the most efficient, effective and the benefits are greater than the costs of prevention and early intervention programs.&lt;ref&gt;American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, Cost Effectiveness of Prevention and Early Intervention, June 2011; http://www.aacap.org/app_themes/aacap/docs/advocacy/policy_resources/cost_effectiveness_fact_sheet_2011.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Youth Intervention has come to be recognized as an important part of reforming the United States juvenile justice system.  It produces better outcomes and at a lower cost per youth than incarceration. Of youth confined in juvenile correction institutions, many are confined for nonviolent offenses. Of all juvenile commitments and detentions, 40% are for offenses that are not clear threats to the community's safety. These offenses include low level property offenses, as well as status offenses (activities that are considered a crime only due to the youth's age; examples ae truancy, possession of 
alcohol).&lt;ref&gt;The Annie E. Casey Foundation, Youth Incarceration In the United States, 2013, page 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the high costs, incarceration does not produce positive outcomes for youth. Community based Youth Intervention produce much better outcomes for juveniles at low risk to reoffend.&lt;ref&gt;The Pew Charitable Trusts, Re-Examining Juvenile Incarceration, April 20, 2015; http://www.pewtrusts.org/en/research-and-analysis/issue-briefs/2015/04/reexamining-juvenile-incarceration&lt;/ref&gt;
