'''9-Hydroxyoctadecadienoic acid''' (9-hydroxy-10(''E''),12(''Z'')-octadecadienoic acid or '''9-HODE''') has been used in the literature to designate either or both of two [[stereoisomer]] metabolites of the [[essential fatty acid]], [[linoleic acid]]: 9(''S'')-hydroxy-10(''E''),12(''Z'')-octadecadienoic acid (9(''S'')-HODE) and 9(''R'')-hydroxy-10(''E''),12(''Z'')-octadecadienoic acid (9(''R'')-HODE); these two metabolites differ in having their hydroxy residues in the ''S'' or ''R'' configurations, respectively.  The accompanying figure gives the structure for 9(''S'')-HETE.  Two other 9-hydroxy linoleic acid derivatives occur in nature, the 10''E'',12''E'' isomers of 9(''S'')-HODE and 9''(R'')-HODE viz., 9(''S'')-hydroxy-10''E'',12''E''-octadecadienoic acid (9(''S'')-''EE''-HODE) and 9(''R'')-hydroxy-10''E'',12''E''-octadecadienoic acid (13(''R'')-''EE''-HODE); these two derivatives have their double bond at carbon 12 in the ''E'' or trans configuration as opposed to the ''Z'' or cis configuration.  The four 9-HODE isomers, particularly under conditions of [[oxidative stress]], may form together in cells and tissues; they have overlapping but not identical biological activities and significances.  Because many studies have not distinguished between the ''S'' and ''R'' stereoisomers and, particularly in identifying tissue levels, the two ''EE'' isomers, 9-HODE is used here when the isomer studied is unclear.

A similar set of [[13-Hydroxyoctadecadienoic acid]] (13-HODE) metabolites (13(S)-HODE), 13(R)-HODE, 13(S)-EE-HODE), and 13(R)-EE-HODE) also occurs naturally and, again particularly under conditions of oxidative stress, may form concurrently with 9-HODEs; these 13-HODEs also have overlapping and complementary but not identical activities with the 9-HODEs.  Some recent studies measuring HODE levels in tissue have lumped the four 9-HODEs and four 13-HODEs together to report only on total HODEs (tHODEs): tHODEs have been proposed to be markers for certain human disease. Other recent studies have lumped together the 9-(''S''), 9(''R''), 13 (''S'')-, and 13(''R'')-HODE along with the two [[ketone]] metabolites of these HODEs, 9-oxoODE (9-oxo-10(''E''),12(''Z'')-octadecadienoic acid)   and 13-oxoODE, reporting only on total '''OXLAMs''' (oxidized linoleic acid metabolites); the OXLAMs have been implicated in working together to signal for pain perception.

== Pathways making 9-HODEs ==

=== Cyclooxygenases 1 and 2 ===
The enzymes [[cyclooxygenase 1]] (COX-1) and [[cyclooxygenase 2]] (COX-2), which are best known for metabolizing [[arachidonic acid]] to [[prostaglandins]], are also able to metabolize linoleic acid predominantly to 9(''R'')-hydroperoxy-10(''E''),12(''Z'')-octadecadienoic acid (i.e. 9(''R'')-HpODE)-HODE) and lesser amounts of 9(''S'')-hydroperoxy-10(''E''),12(''Z'')-octadecadienoic acid (i.e. 9(''S'')-HpODE); in cells and tissues, the two hydroperoxy metabolites are rapidly reduce to 9(''R'')-HODE and 9(''S'')-HODE, respectively.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;J Biol Chem. 1995 Aug 18;270(33):19330-6&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;J Invest Dermatol. 1996 Nov;107(5):726-32&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;rch Biochem Biophys. 1998 Jan 15;349(2):376-80&lt;/ref&gt;  COX-2 exhibits a greater preference for linoleic acid than does Cox-1 and is therefore credited with producing most of these products in cells expressing both COX enzymes.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;  The COXs also metabolize linoleic acid to 13(''S'')-hydroperoxy-octadecadionoic acid (13(''S'')-HpODE and lesser amounts of 13(''R'')-hydroperoxy-octadecadienoic acid (13(''R'')-HpODE, which are then rapidly reduced to 13(''S'')-HODE) and 13(''R'')-HODE; the two enzymes therefore metabolize linoleic acid predominantly to the ''R'' stereoisomer of 9-HODE and (''S'') stereoisomer of 13-HODE with the 13-HODE products predominating over the 9-HODE products.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Prostaglandins. 1989 Aug;38(2):203-14&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Cytochrome P450 ===
[[Cytochrome P450]] [[microsomal]] enzymes metabolize linoleic acid to a mixture of 9(''S'')-HpODE and 9(''R'')-HpODE which are subsequently reduced to their corresponding hydroxy products; these reactions produce racemic mixtures in which the ''R'' stereoisomer predominates, for instance by a ''R''/''S'' ratio of 80%/20% in human liver microsomes.&lt;ref&gt;Arch Biochem Biophys. 1984 Aug 15;233(1):80-7&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"&gt;Biochim Biophys Acta. 1993 Feb 24;1166(2-3):258-63&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1186/1744-8069-8-73|pmid=23006841|pmc=3488501|title=The Cytochrome P450 Inhibitor, Ketoconazole, Inhibits Oxidized Linoleic Acid Metabolite-Mediated Peripheral Inflammatory Pain|journal=Molecular Pain|volume=8|pages=1744–8069–8–73|year=2012|last1=Ruparel|first1=Shivani|last2=Green|first2=Dustin|last3=Chen|first3=Paul|last4=Hargreaves|first4=Kenneth M.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In cells and tissues, the cytochrome enzymes concurrently metabolize linoleic acid to 13(''S'')-HpODE and 13(''R'')-HpODE which are reduced to 13(''S'')-HODE and 13(''R'')-HODE in an ''R''/''S'' ratio similar to than of the 9-HODES, i.e. 80%/20%.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt;

=== Free radical and singlet oxygen oxidations ===
[[Oxidative stress]] in cells and tissues produces [[Free radical]]-induced and [[singlet oxygen]]-induced oxidations of linoleic acid to generate the various racemic mixtures of 9-HpODE and 9-HODE in non-enzymatic reactions that produce, or are suspected but not proven to produce, approximately equal amounts of their ''S'' and ''R'' stereoisomers.&lt;ref&gt;Prog Lipid Res. 1984;23(4):197-221&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Biochim Biophys Acta. 1998 May 20;1392(1):23-40&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Chem Res Toxicol. 2005 Feb;18(2):349-56&lt;/ref&gt;  These oxidations are credited with being the major contributors to 9-HODE and 13-HODE isomer production in tissues undergoing oxidative stress such as occurs in any tissue suffering inadequate blood flow, inflammation, or other serious insult, in liver [[steatohepatitis]], in the [[atheroma]] plaques of [[cardiovascular disease]], in nerve tissues of neurodegenerative diseases, and in the various tissues compromised by diabetes (see [[oxidative stress]]).&lt;ref name="Leukot Essent Fatty Acids 2012"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.plefa.2012.08.004|pmid=22959954|pmc=3467319|title=Lowering dietary linoleic acid reduces bioactive oxidized linoleic acid metabolites in humans|journal=Prostaglandins, Leukotrienes and Essential Fatty Acids|volume=87|issue=4–5|pages=135–141|year=2012|last1=Ramsden|first1=Christopher E.|last2=Ringel|first2=Amit|last3=Feldstein|first3=Ariel E.|last4=Taha|first4=Ameer Y.|last5=MacIntosh|first5=Beth A.|last6=Hibbeln|first6=Joseph R.|last7=Majchrzak-Hong|first7=Sharon F.|last8=Faurot|first8=Keturah R.|last9=Rapoport|first9=Stanley I.|last10=Cheon|first10=Yewon|last11=Chung|first11=Yoon-Mi|last12=Berk|first12=Michael|last13=Douglas Mann|first13=J.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.5650/jos.ess14281|pmid=25766928|title=Chemistry of Lipid Peroxidation Products and Their Use as Biomarkers in Early Detection of Diseases|journal=Journal of Oleo Science|volume=64|issue=4|pages=347–356|year=2015|last1=Yoshida|first1=Yasukazu|last2=Umeno|first2=Aya|last3=Akazawa|first3=Yoko|last4=Shichiri|first4=Mototada|last5=Murotomi|first5=Kazutoshi|last6=Horie|first6=Masanori}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Free radical oxidation of linoleic acid produces racemic mixtures of 9-HODE and 9-EE-HODE; singlet oxygen attack on linoleic acid produces (presumably) racemic mixtures of 9-HODE, 10-hydroxy-8''E'',12''Z''-octadecadienoic acid, and 12-hydroxy-9''Z''-13-''E''-octadecadienoic acid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.freeradbiomed.2014.12.004|pmid=25499849|title=Singlet-oxygen-derived products from linoleate activate Nrf2 signaling in skin cells|journal=Free Radical Biology and Medicine|volume=79|pages=164–175|year=2015|last1=Akazawa-Ogawa|first1=Yoko|last2=Shichiri|first2=Mototada|last3=Nishio|first3=Keiko|last4=Yoshida|first4=Yasukazu|last5=Niki|first5=Etsuo|last6=Hagihara|first6=Yoshihisa}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.5650/jos.ess14281|pmid=25766928|title=Chemistry of Lipid Peroxidation Products and Their Use as Biomarkers in Early Detection of Diseases|journal=Journal of Oleo Science|volume=64|issue=4|pages=347–356|year=2015|last1=Yoshida|first1=Yasukazu|last2=Umeno|first2=Aya|last3=Akazawa|first3=Yoko|last4=Shichiri|first4=Mototada|last5=Murotomi|first5=Kazutoshi|last6=Horie|first6=Masanori}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Since free radical-induced and singlet oxygen-induced oxidations of linoleic acid produce a similar set of 13-HODE metabolites (see [[13-Hydroxyoctadecadienoic acid]]), since both free radicals and singlet oxygen attack not only free linoleic acid but also linoleic acid bound to [[phospholipids]], [[glycerides]], cholesterol, and other lipids, and since free radical and singlet oxygen reactions may occur together, oxygen-stressed tissues often contain an array of free and lipid-bound 9-HODE and 13-HODE products.  For example, laboratory studies find that 9-HODE and 9-EE-HODE (along with their 13-HODE counterparts) are found in the phospholipid and cholesterol components of [[low density lipoprotein]]s that have been oxidized by human monocytes; the reaction appears due to the in situ free radical- and/or superoxide-induced oxidation of the lipoproteins.&lt;ref&gt;J Lipid Res. 1994 Sep;35(9):1570-82&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Mouse 8(''S'')-lipoxygenase ===
The murine homolog of human 15(''S'')-lipoxygenase-2 (ALOX15B), 8(''S'')-lipoxygenase, while preferring arachidonic acid over linoleic acid, metabolizes linoleic acid predominantly to (9(''S'')-HpODE, which in tissues and cells is rapidly reduced to 9(''S'')-HODE.&lt;ref&gt;Mol Carcinog. 1999 Feb;24(2):108-17&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Oncogene. 2005 Feb 10;24(7):1174-87&lt;/ref&gt; However, ALOX15B, similar to human 15-lipoxygenase-1 (ALOX15), metabolizes linoleic acid to 13(''S'')-HODE but not to 9(''S'')-HODEs.&lt;ref&gt;Eur. J. Biochem. 1999 Nov;266(1):83-93&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1997 Jun 10;94(12):6148-52&lt;/ref&gt;

== Metabolism ==
Like most unsaturated fatty acids, the 9-HODEs formed in cells are incorporated into cellular [[phospholipids]] principally at the sn-2 position of the phospholipid (see [[Phospholipase A2]]);&lt;ref&gt;Exp Dermatol. 1993 Feb;2(1):38-4&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;J Lipid Res. 1993 Sep;34(9):1473-82&lt;/ref&gt; since, however, the linoleic acid bound to cellular phospholipids is susceptible to non-enzymatic peroxidation and free radical attack,&lt;ref&gt;Free Radic Biol Med. 1995 Jun;18(6):1003-12&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Biochim Biophys Acta. 1999 May 18;1438(2):204-12&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1021/bi301024e|pmid=23148485|pmc=3567262|title=Specificity of Lipoprotein-Associated Phospholipase A2 toward Oxidized Phosphatidylserines: Liquid Chromatography–Electrospray Ionization Mass Spectrometry Characterization of Products and Computer Modeling of Interactions|journal=Biochemistry|volume=51|issue=48|pages=9736–9750|year=2012|last1=Tyurin|first1=Vladimir A.|last2=Yanamala|first2=Naveena|last3=Tyurina|first3=Yulia Y.|last4=Klein-Seetharaman|first4=Judith|last5=MacPhee|first5=Colin H.|last6=Kagan|first6=Valerian E.}}&lt;/ref&gt; the 9-HODEs in cellular phospholipids may also derive more directly from in situ oxidation.  9-HODE esterified to the sn-2 position of [[phosphatidylserine]] is subject to be released as free 9-HODE by the action of cytosolic (see [[phospholipase A2]] section on cPLA2) and therefore may serve as a storage pool that is mobilized by cell stimulation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1021/bi301024e|pmid=23148485|pmc=3567262|title=Specificity of Lipoprotein-Associated Phospholipase A2 toward Oxidized Phosphatidylserines: Liquid Chromatography–Electrospray Ionization Mass Spectrometry Characterization of Products and Computer Modeling of Interactions|journal=Biochemistry|volume=51|issue=48|pages=9736–9750|year=2012|last1=Tyurin|first1=Vladimir A.|last2=Yanamala|first2=Naveena|last3=Tyurina|first3=Yulia Y.|last4=Klein-Seetharaman|first4=Judith|last5=MacPhee|first5=Colin H.|last6=Kagan|first6=Valerian E.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

9-HODE may be further metabolized to 9-oxo-10(''E''),12(''Z'')-octadecadienoic acid (9-oxoODE or 9-oxo-ODE), possibly by the same hydroxy fatty acid dehydrogenase which metabolizes other hydroxy fatty acids, such as 13-HODE, to their oxo derivatives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1002/bmc.2809|pmid=23037960|pmc=3552117|title=Identification and profiling of targeted oxidized linoleic acid metabolites in rat plasma by quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry|journal=Biomedical Chromatography|volume=27|issue=4|pages=422–432|year=2013|last1=Yuan|first1=Zhi-Xin|last2=Rapoport|first2=Stanley I.|last3=Soldin|first3=Steven J.|last4=Remaley|first4=Alan T.|last5=Taha|first5=Ameer Y.|last6=Kellom|first6=Matthew|last7=Gu|first7=Jianghong|last8=Sampson|first8=Maureen|last9=Ramsden|first9=Christopher E.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Direct actions ==
9-HODE, 9-oxoODE, and 9-EE-HODE (along with their 13-HODE counterparts) directly activate [[peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma]] (PPARγ).&lt;ref name="Cell. 1998 Apr 17;932:229-40"&gt;Cell. 1998 Apr 17;93(2):229-40&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nat Struct Mol Biol. 2008 Sep;15(9):924-31&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Biol Pharm Bull. 2009 Apr;32(4):735-40&lt;/ref&gt;  This activation appears responsible for the ability of 13-HODE (and 9-HODE) to induce the transcription of PPARγ-inducible genes in human [[monocytes]] as well as to stimulate the maturation of these cells to [[macrophage]]s.&lt;ref name="Cell. 1998 Apr 17;932:229-40"/&gt;  13(''S'')-HODE (and 9(''S'')-HODE) also stimulate the activation of [[peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor beta]] (PPARβ) in a model cell system; 13-HODE (and 9-HODE) are also proposed to contribute to the ability of oxidized [[low-density lipoprotein]] (LDL) to activate PPARβl: LDL containing [[phospholipid]]-bound 13-HODE (and 9-HODE) is taken up by the cell and then acted on by [[phospholipase]]s to release the HODEs which in turn directly activate PPARβl.&lt;ref&gt;FEBS Lett. 2000 Apr 7;471(1):34-8&lt;/ref&gt;

13(''S'')-HODE, 13(''R'')-HODE and 13-oxoODE, along with their 9-HODE counterparts, also act on cells through [[TRPV1]].  TRPV1 is the transient receptor potential cation channel subfamily V member 1 receptor (also termed capsaicin receptor or vanilloid receptor 1).  These 6 HODEs, dubbed, oxidized [[linoleic acid]] metabolites (OXLAMs), individually but also and possibly to a greater extent when acting together, stimulate TRPV1-dependent responses in rodent neurons, rodent and human bronchial epithelial cells, and in model cells made to express rodent or human TRPV1.  This stimulation appears due to a direct interaction of these agents on TRPV1 although reports disagree on the potencies of the (OXLAMs) with, for example, the most potent OXLAM, 9(''S'')-HODE, requiring at least 10 micromoles/liter&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1476-5381.2012.02122.x|pmid=22861649|pmc=3525867|title=A re-evaluation of 9-HODE activity at TRPV1 channels in comparison with anandamide: Enantioselectivity and effects at other TRP channels and in sensory neurons|journal=British Journal of Pharmacology|volume=167|issue=8|pages=1643–1651|year=2012|last1=De Petrocellis|first1=Luciano|last2=Schiano Moriello|first2=Aniello|last3=Imperatore|first3=Roberta|last4=Cristino|first4=Luigia|last5=Starowicz|first5=Katarzyna|last6=Di Marzo|first6=Vincenzo}}&lt;/ref&gt; or a more physiological concentration of 10 nanomoles/liter&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1073/pnas.0905415106|pmid=19843694|pmc=2764734|title=Activation of TRPV1 in the spinal cord by oxidized linoleic acid metabolites contributes to inflammatory hyperalgesia|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|volume=106|issue=44|pages=18820–18824|year=2009|last1=Patwardhan|first1=A.

The OXLAM-TRPV1 interaction is credited with mediating pain sensation in rodents (see below).

9(''S'')-HODE and with progressively lesser potencies 9(''S'')-HpODE, a [[racemic mixture]] of 9-HODE, 13(''S'')-HpODE, and 13(''S'')-HODE directly activate human (but not mouse) [[GPR132]] (i.e. G protein coupled receptor 132 or G2A) in [[Chinese hamster ovary cell]]s made to express these receptors; 9(''S'')-HODE was also a more potent stimulator of human G2A than a series of mono-hydroxy [[arachidonic acid]] metabolites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.prostaglandins.2008.11.002|pmid=19063986|title=G2A as a receptor for oxidized free fatty acids|journal=Prostaglandins &amp; Other Lipid Mediators|volume=89|issue=3–4|pages=66–72|year=2009|last1=Obinata|first1=Hideru|last2=Izumi|first2=Takashi}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1074/jbc.M806516200|pmid=19286662|pmc=2673301|title=Lipid G Protein-coupled Receptor Ligand Identification Using β-Arrestin Path ''Hunter''™ Assay|journal=Journal of Biological Chemistry|volume=284|issue=18|pages=12328–12338|year=2009|last1=Yin|first1=Hong|last2=Chu|first2=Alan|last3=Li|first3=Wei|last4=Wang|first4=Bin|last5=Shelton|first5=Fabiola|last6=Otero|first6=Francella|last7=Nguyen|first7=Deborah G.|last8=Caldwell|first8=Jeremy S.|last9=Chen|first9=Yu Alice}}&lt;/ref&gt;  GPR132  was initially described as a pH sensing receptor; the role(s) of 9-HODEs as well as other linoleic and arachidonic acid metabolites in activating GPR132 under the physiological and pathological conditions in which it is implicated  to be involved(see (see [[GPR132]] for a listing of these conditions) have not yet been determined.  This determination, as it might apply to humans, is made difficult by the inability of these HODEs to activate rodent GPR132 and therefore to be analyzed in rodent models.

Various measurements of tissue and blood levels of [[reactive oxygen species]] have been used as markers of diseases in which these species are generated and may contribute to tissue injury and systemic disturbances; examples of such diseases include a wide range of neurological, cardiovascular, infectious, autoimmune, and genetic diseases (see [[oxidative stress]]).  HODEs measurements have been evaluated as markers for many of these oxygen stress-related diseases.  These measurements commonly use [[saponification]] methods to release HODEs bound by [[acylation]] to other molecules; they therefore measure not only free HODEs but also HODEs acylated to [[phospholipids]], [[glycerides]], [[cholesterol]], and other [[lipids]].

Studies find that '''1)''' 9(''S'')-HODE (and 13(''S'')-HODE) levels are elevated in the plasma of older patients with early-stage [[cataracts]] compared to non-cataract subjects; '''2)''' 9-HODE (and 13-HODE) are increased in the [[low density lipoprotein]]s of patients with [[rheumatoid arthritis]] compared to healthy subjects as well as in the destructive but not normal bone tissue of the rheumatoid arthritic patients; '''3)''' total HODEs (includes 9-HODE and 13-HODE stereoisomers) are higher in the plasma and liver of patients with [[hepatitis C]] and [[hepatitis B]] chronic viral infections as well as in the plasma and [[red blood cells]] of patients with [[Alzheimer's disease]] compared to healthy subjects; '''4)''' 9-HODE and 9-oxoODE (as well as 13-HODE and 13-oxo-ODE) levels were elevated in the serum and/or pancreatic secretions of patients with [[pancreatitis]] compared to control subjects; '''5)''' levels of the hydroperoxy precursors to 9-HODE and 13-HODE are elevated in the plasma and/or red blood cells of patients with Alzheimer's disease, [[atherosclerosis]], [[diabetes]], diabetic [[nephritis]], non-alcoholic [[steatohepatitis]], and alcoholic steatohepatitis compared to healthy subjects.&lt;ref&gt;Chem Phys Lipids. 1997 May 30;87(1):81-9&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Z Naturforsch C. 1998 Nov-Dec;53(11-12):1061-71&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/eye.2008.281|pmid=18806766|pmc=2695503|title=Oxidative stress and antioxidant status in older adults with early cataract|journal=Eye|volume=23|issue=6|pages=1464–1468|year=2009|last1=Li|first1=L.|last2=Duker|first2=J.

=== As mediators of oxidative stress-related diseases ===

Some of the studies cited above have suggested that 9-HODEs, 13-HODEs, their hydroperoxy counterparts, and/or their oxo counterparts contribute mechanistically to these oxidative stress-related diseases.  That is, the free radical oxidation of linoleic acid makes these products which then proceed to contribute to the tissue injury, DNA damage, and/or systemic dysfunctions that characterize the diseases.&lt;ref name="riahi"&gt;{{cite journal |pmid= 20858748 |doi=10.1152/ajpendo.00508.2010|year=2010|last1=Riahi|first1=Y.|title=Signaling and cytotoxic functions of 4-hydroxyalkenals|journal=American Journal of Physiology.

It remains unclear whether or not the HODEs and their counterparts promote, dampen, or merely reflect oxidative stress-related diseases.

The accelerated expansion was discovered in 1998, by two independent projects, the [[Supernova Cosmology Project]] and the [[High-Z Supernova Search Team]], which both used distant [[type Ia supernovae]] to measure the acceleration.&lt;ref name="BBC"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-15165371 |title=Nobel physics prize honours accelerating universe find |publisher=BBC News |date=2011-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/2011/# |title=The Nobel Prize in Physics 2011 |publisher=Nobelprize.org |accessdate=2011-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="peebles"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Peebles |first1=P.

The distance can then be compared to the supernovae's cosmological [[redshift]], which measures how much the universe has expanded since the supernova occurred.&lt;ref&gt;See also [[Hubble law]], which established that the further an object is from us, the faster it is receding.&lt;/ref&gt; The unexpected result was that objects in the universe are moving away from another at an accelerated rate. Cosmologists at the time expected that recession velocity would always be decelerating to the gravitational attraction of the matter in the universe.

Within the framework of [[general relativity]], an accelerated expansion can be accounted for by a positive value of the [[cosmological constant]] {{mvar|Λ}}, equivalent to the presence of a positive [[vacuum energy]], dubbed "[[dark energy]]". While there are alternative possible explanations, the description assuming dark energy (positive {{mvar|Λ}}) is used in the current standard model of [[physical cosmology|cosmology]], which also includes [[cold dark matter]] (CDM) and is known as the [[Lambda-CDM model]].

:&lt;math&gt; H(a)=H_0 \sqrt{{\Omega_ka^{-2} + \Omega}_ma^{-3} + \Omega_ra^{-4} + \Omega_\mathrm{DE}a^{-3(1+w)}} &lt;/math&gt;

where the four currently hypothesized contributors to the energy density of the universe are [[Shape of the universe|curvature]], [[matter]], [[radiation]] and [[dark energy]].&lt;ref name=Bassett&gt;{{cite book |last=Lapuente |first=P. |chapter=Baryon Acoustic Oscillations |title=Dark Energy: Observational and Theoretical Approaches |location=Cambridge, UK |publisher=Cambridge University Press |date=2010 |isbn=978-0521518888}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each of the components decreases with the expansion of the universe (increasing scale factor), except perhaps the dark energy term. It is the values of these cosmological parameters which physicists use to determine the acceleration of the universe.

The [[Friedmann equations|acceleration equation]] describes the evolution of the scale factor with time

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{\ddot{a}}{a}=-\frac{4{\pi}G}{3}\left( \rho + \frac{3P}{c^2} \right) &lt;/math&gt;

where the [[pressure]] {{mvar|P}} is defined by the cosmological model chosen. (see [[Accelerating universe#Explanatory models|explanatory models]] below)

Physicists at one time were so assured of the deceleration of the universe's expansion that they introduced a so-called [[deceleration parameter]] {{math|''q''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}}.&lt;ref name=Ryden&gt;{{cite book |title=Introduction to Cosmology |last=Ryden |first=Barbara |location=San Francisco, CA |publisher=Addison Wesley |date=2003 |isbn=978-0-8053-8912-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed |date=September 2016}} Current observations point towards this deceleration parameter being negative.

===Relation to inflation===
According to the theory of [[Inflation (cosmology)|cosmic inflation]], the very early universe underwent a period of very rapid, quasi-exponential expansion. While the time-scale for this period of expansion was far shorter than that of the current expansion, this was a period of accelerated expansion with some similarities to the current epoch.

===Technical definition===
The definition of "accelerating expansion" is that the second time derivative of the cosmic scale factor, &lt;math&gt; \ddot{a} &lt;/math&gt;, is positive, which implies that the [[deceleration parameter]] is negative. However, note this does &lt;b&gt;not&lt;/b&gt; imply that the [[Hubble constant|Hubble parameter]] is increasing with time. Since the Hubble parameter is defined as &lt;math&gt; H(t) \equiv \dot{a}(t) / a(t) &lt;/math&gt;, it follows from the definitions that the derivative of the Hubble parameter is given by 

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{dH}{dt} = -H^2(1 + q) &lt;/math&gt;

so the Hubble parameter is decreasing with time unless &lt;math&gt; q &lt; -1 &lt;/math&gt;. Observations prefer &lt;math&gt; q \approx -0.55 &lt;/math&gt;, which implies that &lt;math&gt; \ddot{a} &lt;/math&gt; is positive but &lt;math&gt; dH/dt &lt;/math&gt; is negative.  Essentially, this implies that the cosmic recession velocity of any one particular galaxy is increasing with time, but its velocity/distance ratio is still decreasing; thus different galaxies expanding across a sphere of fixed radius cross the sphere more slowly at later times.

It is seen from above that the case of "zero acceleration/deceleration" corresponds to &lt;math&gt; a(t)&lt;/math&gt; is a linear function of &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt; q = 0 &lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt; \dot{a} = const&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt; H(t) = 1/t &lt;/math&gt;.

==Evidence for acceleration==
To learn about the rate of expansion of the universe we look at the [[Magnitude (astronomy)|magnitude]]-redshift relationship of astronomical objects using [[Cosmic distance ladder#Standard candles|standard candles]], or their distance-redshift relationship using [[standard ruler]]s. We can also look at the growth of [[large-scale structure of the universe|large-scale structure]], and find that the observed values of the cosmological parameters are best described by models which include an accelerating expansion.

===Supernova observation===
[[File:Asymmetric Ashes (artist's impression).jpg|thumb|left|200px|Artist's impression of a Type Ia supernova, as revealed by spectro-polarimetry observations]]
The first evidence for acceleration came from the observation of [[Type Ia supernova]]e, which are exploding [[white dwarf]]s that have exceeded their [[Chandrasekhar limit|stability limit]]. Because they all have similar masses, their intrinsic [[luminosity]] is standardizable. Repeated imaging of selected areas of the sky is used to discover the supernovae, then follow-up observations give their peak brightness, which is converted into a quantity known as luminosity distance (see [[distance measures in cosmology]] for details).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arxiv |last1=Albrecht|first1=Andreas |display-authors=etal |title=Report of the Dark Energy Task Force |date=2006 |eprint=astro-ph/0609591}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Spectral line]]s of their light can be used to determine their [[redshift]].

For supernovae at redshift less than around 0.1, or light travel time less than 10 percent of the age of the universe, this gives a nearly linear distance–redshift relation due to [[Hubble's law]]. At larger distances, since the expansion rate of the universe has changed over time, the distance-redshift relation deviates from linearity, and this deviation depends on how the expansion rate has changed over time. The full calculation requires computer integration of the Friedmann equation, but a simple derivation can be given as follows: the redshift {{mvar|z}} directly gives the [[cosmic scale factor]] at the time the supernova exploded.

:&lt;math&gt; a(t)=\frac{1}{1+z} &lt;/math&gt;

So a supernova with a measured redshift {{math|''z'' {{=}} 0.5}} implies the universe was {{sfrac|1|1 + 0.5}}&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;{{sfrac|2|3}} of its present size when the supernova exploded. In the standard accelerated expansion scenario the rate of expansion still decreases, but does so more slowly than the non-accelerated case. This means that in the accelerated case, the past rate of expansion is slower than it would be in the non-accelerated case.  Thus in a universe with accelerated expansion, it takes a longer time to expand from two thirds its present size, compared to a non-accelerating universe with the same present-day value of the Hubble constant. This results in a larger light-travel time, larger distance and fainter supernovae, which corresponds to the actual observations. [[Adam Riess]] ''et al.'' found that "the distances of the high-redshift SNe Ia were, on average, 10% to 15% farther than expected in a low mass density {{math|''Ω''&lt;sub&gt;M&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} 0.2}} universe without a cosmological constant".&lt;ref name=Riess&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Riess |first1=Adam G. |display-authors=etal |title=Observational Evidence from Supernovae for an Accelerating Universe and a Cosmological Constant |journal=The Astronomical Journal |volume=116 |issue=3 |pages=1009–1038 |year=1998 |doi=10.1086/300499 |bibcode=1998AJ....116.1009R |arxiv=astro-ph/9805201 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This means that the measured high-redshift distances were too large, compared to nearby ones, for a decelerating universe.&lt;ref name=Pain&gt;{{cite journal |last=Pain |first=Reynald |last2=Astier |first2=Pierre |title=Observational evidence of the accelerated expansion of the Universe |journal=Comptes Rendus Physique |volume=13 |issue=6 |pages=521–538 |arxiv=1204.5493 |doi=10.1016/j.crhy.2012.04.009 |date=2012 |bibcode=2012CRPhy..13..521A |citeseerx=10.1.1.747.3792}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Baryon acoustic oscillations===
{{main|Baryon acoustic oscillations}}
In the early universe before [[recombination (cosmology)|recombination]] and [[decoupling (cosmology)|decoupling]] took place, [[photon]]s and matter existed in a [[Structure formation#Primordial plasma|primordial plasma]]. Points of higher density in the photon-baryon plasma would contract, being compressed by gravity until the pressure became too large and they expanded again.&lt;ref name=Ryden/&gt;{{Page needed|date=September 2016}} This contraction and expansion created vibrations in the plasma analogous to [[sound waves]]. Since [[dark matter]] only interacts [[gravitationally]] it stayed at the centre of the sound wave, the origin of the original overdensity. When decoupling occurred, approximately 380,000 years after the Big Bang,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Hinshaw |first1=G. |year=2009 |title=Five-Year Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP) Observations: Data Processing, Sky Maps, and Basic Results |doi=10.1088/0067-0049/180/2/225 |journal=Astrophysical Journal Supplement |volume=180 |issue=2 |pages=225–245 |arxiv=0803.0732 |bibcode=2009ApJS..180..225H }}&lt;/ref&gt; photons separated from matter and were able to [[free streaming|stream freely]] through the universe, creating the [[cosmic microwave background]] as we know it. This left shells of [[baryonic matter]] at a fixed radius from the overdensities of dark matter, a distance known as the sound horizon. As time passed and the universe expanded, it was at these anisotropies of matter density where galaxies started to form. So by looking at the distances at which galaxies at different redshifts tend to cluster, it is possible to determine a standard [[angular diameter distance]] and use that to compare to the distances predicted by different cosmological models.

Peaks have been found in the correlation function (the probability that two galaxies will be a certain distance apart) at {{nowrap|100 ''h''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; [[Parsec#Megaparsecs and Gigaparsecs|Mpc]]}},&lt;ref name=Bassett/&gt; indicating that this is the size of the sound horizon today, and by comparing this to the sound horizon at the time of decoupling (using the CMB), we can confirm the accelerated expansion of the universe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Eisenstein |first1=Daniel J. |display-authors=etal |title=Detection of the Baryon Acoustic Peak in the Large‐Scale Correlation Function of SDSS Luminous Red Galaxies |journal=The Astrophysical Journal |year=2005 |volume=633 |issue=2 |pages=560–574 |doi=10.1086/466512 |bibcode=2005ApJ...633..560E |arxiv=astro-ph/0501171 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Clusters of galaxies===
Measuring the mass functions of [[galaxy cluster]]s, which describe the [[number density]] of the clusters above a threshold mass, also provides evidence for dark energy {{explain|date=March 2018}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Dekel |first=Avishai |title=Formation of Structure in the Universe |location=New York, NY |publisher=Cambridge University Press |date=1999 |isbn=9780521586320}}&lt;/ref&gt; By comparing these mass functions at high and low redshifts to those predicted by different cosmological models, values for {{mvar|w}} and {{mvar|Ω&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;}} are obtained which confirm a low matter density and a non zero amount of dark energy.&lt;ref name=Pain/&gt;

===Age of the universe===
{{see also|Age of the universe}}
Given a cosmological model with certain values of the cosmological density parameters, it is possible to integrate the Friedmann equations and derive the age of the universe.

:&lt;math&gt; t_0=\int_{0}^{1}\frac{da}{\dot{a}} &lt;/math&gt;

By comparing this to actual measured values of the cosmological parameters, we can confirm the validity of a model which is accelerating now, and had a slower expansion in the past.&lt;ref name=Pain/&gt;

==Explanatory models==
[[File:Dark Energy.jpg|thumb|right|400px|The expansion of the Universe accelerating. Time flows from bottom to top]]

===Dark energy===
{{main|Dark energy}}
The most important property of dark energy is that it has negative pressure (repulsive action) which is distributed relatively homogeneously in space.

:&lt;math&gt; P=wc^2\rho &lt;/math&gt;

where {{mvar|c}} is the speed of light and {{mvar|ρ}} is the energy density. Different theories of dark energy suggest different values of {{mvar|w}}, with {{math|''w'' &lt; −{{sfrac|1|3}}}} for cosmic acceleration (this leads to a positive value of {{mvar|ä}} in the [[Accelerating expansion of the universe#Background|acceleration equation]] above).

The simplest explanation for dark energy is that it is a cosmological constant or [[vacuum energy]]; in this case {{math|''w'' {{=}} −1}}. This leads to the [[Lambda-CDM model]], which has generally been known as the Standard Model of Cosmology from 2003 through the present, since it is the simplest model in good agreement with a variety of recent observations. Riess ''et al.'' found that their results from supernovae observations favoured expanding models with positive cosmological constant ({{math|''Ω&lt;sub&gt;λ&lt;/sub&gt;'' &gt; 0}}) and a current accelerated expansion ({{math|''q''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; &lt; 0}}).&lt;ref name=Riess/&gt;

===Phantom energy===
{{main|Phantom energy}}
Current observations allow the possibility of a cosmological model containing a dark energy component with equation of state {{math|''w'' &lt; −1}}. This phantom energy density would become infinite in finite time, causing such a huge gravitational repulsion that the universe would lose all structure and end in a [[Big Rip]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Caldwell |first1=Robert |last2=Kamionkowski |first2=Marc |last3=Weinberg |first3=Nevin |title=Phantom Energy: Dark Energy with {{math |''w'' &lt; −1}} Causes a Cosmic Doomsday |journal=Physical Review Letters |volume=91 |issue=7 |doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.91.071301 |bibcode=2003PhRvL..91g1301C |pmid=12935004 |date=August 2003 |pages=071301 |arxiv=astro-ph/0302506 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, for {{math|''w'' {{=}} −{{sfrac|3|2}}}} and {{math|''H''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}}&amp;nbsp;=70&amp;nbsp;km·s&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;·Mpc&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;, the time remaining before the universe ends in this Big Rip is 22&amp;nbsp;billion years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Caldwell |first1=R.

There are many alternative explanations for the accelerating universe. Some examples are [[quintessence (physics)|quintessence]], a proposed form of dark energy with a non-constant state equation, whose density decreases with time.

Inhomogeneities in the early universe cause the formation of walls and bubbles, where the inside of a bubble has less matter than on average. According to general relativity, space is less curved than on the walls, and thus appears to have more volume and a higher expansion rate. In the denser regions, the expansion is slowed by a higher gravitational attraction. Therefore, the inward collapse of the denser regions looks the same as an accelerating expansion of the bubbles, leading us to conclude that the universe is undergoing an accelerated expansion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.space.com/23025-doctor-who-tardis-regions-universe.html |title=A Cosmic 'Tardis': What the Universe Has In Common with 'Doctor Who' |website=Space.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The benefit is that it does not require any new physics such as dark energy. Räsänen does not consider the model likely, but without any falsification, it must remain a possibility. It would require rather large density fluctuations (20%) to work.&lt;ref name="NS2007" /&gt;

A final possibility is that dark energy is an illusion caused by some bias in measurements.

==Theories for the consequences to the universe==
{{See also|Future of an expanding universe}}
As the universe expands, the density of radiation and ordinary [[dark matter]] declines more quickly than the density of [[dark energy]] (see [[Equation of state (cosmology)|equation of state]]) and, eventually, dark energy dominates. Specifically, when the scale of the universe doubles, the density of matter is reduced by a factor of 8, but the density of dark energy is nearly unchanged (it is exactly constant if the dark energy is a [[cosmological constant]]).&lt;ref name=Ryden/&gt;{{Page needed|date=September 2016}}

In models where dark energy is a cosmological constant, the universe will expand exponentially with time in the far future, coming closer and closer to a [[de Sitter space]]time. This will eventually lead to all evidence for the Big Bang disappearing, as the cosmic microwave background is redshifted to lower intensities and longer wavelengths. Eventually its frequency will be low enough that it will be absorbed by the [[interstellar medium]], and so be screened from any observer within the galaxy. This will occur when the universe is less than 50 times its current age, leading to the end of cosmology as we know it as the distant universe turns dark.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Krauss |first1=Lawrence M. |last2=Scherrer |first2=Robert J. |title=The return of a static universe and the end of cosmology |journal=General Relativity and Gravitation |year=2007 |volume=39 |issue=10 |pages=1545–1550 |doi=10.1007/s10714-007-0472-9 |arxiv=0704.0221 |bibcode=2007GReGr..39.1545K }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A constantly expanding universe with non-zero cosmological constant has mass density decreasing over time, to an undetermined point when zero matter density is reached. All matter (electrons, protons and neutrons) would ionize and disintegrate, with objects dissipating away.&lt;ref&gt;[[John Baez]], "The End of the Universe", 7 February 2016. http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/end.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Alternatives for the [[ultimate fate of the universe]] include the [[Big Rip]] mentioned above, a [[Big Bounce]], [[Big Freeze]] or [[Big Crunch]].

[[File:Wildfire in California.jpg|thumb|Age class structures can be used to determine when wildfires occurred within a forest population.]]
'''Age class structure''' in [[fisheries]] and [[wildlife management]] is a part of population assessment. Age class structures can be used to model many populations include trees and fish. This method can be used to predict the occurrence of forest fires within a forest population.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wagner|first=C. E. Van|date=1978-06-01|title=Age-class distribution and the forest fire cycle|url=http://www.nrcresearchpress.com/doi/abs/10.1139/x78-034|journal=Canadian Journal of Forest Research|volume=8|issue=2|pages=220–227|doi=10.1139/x78-034|issn=0045-5067}}&lt;/ref&gt; Age can be determined by counting growth rings in [[fish]] scales, [[otoliths]], cross-sections of fin spines for species with thick spines such as [[triggerfish]],&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;O’Sullivan, Sandra (2007). ''Fisheries Long Term Monitoring Program''. Brisbane, Australia: Queensland Department of Primary Industries and Fisheries.&lt;/ref&gt; or teeth for a few species.&lt;ref&gt;Field, I.C., Meekan, M.G. &amp; Bradshaw, C.J.A. (2009). ''Development of non-lethal methods for determining age and habitat use of sawfishes from northern Australia''.

Fish scales are easiest to obtain, but may be unreliable if scales have fallen off the fish and new ones grown in their places.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;[http://www.fao.org/docrep/003/f0752e/F0752E04.HTM "MANUAL OF FISHERIES SCIENCE Part 2 - Methods of Resource Investigation and their Application"]. ''www.fao.org''. Retrieved 2018-03-24.&lt;/ref&gt; Fin spines may be unreliable for the same reason, and most fish do not have spines of sufficient thickness for clear rings to be visible. Otoliths will have stayed with the fish throughout its life history,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; but obtaining them requires killing the fish.&lt;ref&gt;Lux, Fred E. "Age Determination in Fishes". Washington, DC, United States: United States Bureau of Commercial Fisheries. Available at http://spo.nmfs.noaa.gov/Fishery%20Leaflets/leaflet488.pdf. Accessed 24/03/2018.&lt;/ref&gt; Also, otoliths often require more preparation before ageing can occur.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==Analyzing fisheries age class structure==
An example of using age class structure to learn about a population is a regular [[normal distribution|bell curve]] for the population of 1-5 year-old fish with a very low population for the 3-year-olds. An age class structure with gaps in population size like the one described earlier implies a bad [[Spawn (biology)|spawning]] year 3 years ago in that species&lt;sup&gt;[''[[wikipedia:Citation needed|citation needed]]'']&lt;/sup&gt;.

Often fish in younger age class structures have very low numbers because they were small enough to slip through the [[sampling (statistics)|sampling]] nets, and may in fact have a very healthy population.&lt;ref&gt;Haines, Terry A. (1990). ''Intensive Studies of Stream Fish Populations in Maine''. Washington, D.C., USA: U.S. Environment Protection Agency, Office of Acid Deposition, Environmental Monitoring and Quality Assurance. p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:American Nuclear Society logo.svg|thumb|American Nuclear Society logo]]
The '''American Nuclear Society''' (ANS) is an international, [[Non-profit organization|not-for-profit]] [[501(c)]](3) scientific and educational organization with a membership of approximately 11,000 scientists, engineers, educators, students, and other associate members. Approximately 900 members live outside the United States in 45 countries. There are 51 U.S. and nine non-U.S. local sections, 24 [[Nuclear power|nuclear plant]] branches and 34 student sections.  ANS members represent more than 1,750 [[corporation]]s, educational institutions, and [[Independent agencies of the United States government|government agencies]].

The ANS is a member of the [[International Nuclear Societies Council]] (INSC).

==History==

The society was founded on December 11, 1954.  ANS has been a leader in the development of nuclear consensus standards since 1958. The main objective of ANS is to [[lobbying|promote]] the advancement of science and engineering relating to the [[atomic nucleus]].  Other purposes are to integrate the many [[nuclear science]] and [[Nuclear technology|technology]] disciplines, encourage research, establish scholarships, disseminate information through publications and journals, [[public relations|inform the public]] about nuclear-related activities, hold meetings devoted to scientific and technical papers, and cooperate with government agencies, educational institutions, and other organizations having similar purposes. In 1955 [[Walter Zinn]] was elected as the first president of the ANS.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.new.ans.org/about/history/ |title=A Brief History of the American Nuclear Society |publisher=American Nuclear Society |accessdate={{Format date|2011|2|14}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structure==

ANS is made up of 19 Professional Divisions, two work groups (WG) and one technical group (TG).  The technical group is Young Members Group (YMG)&lt;ref&gt;http://ymg.ans.org/&lt;/ref&gt; and is for ANS members under age 36. YMG provides young professionals with opportunities to expand their technical knowledge and network with recognized authorities and the [[nuclear industry]].  It also nominates young professionals for awards and leadership opportunities.  The ANS Young Members Group lends its support to the [[Nuclear Energy Institute]] [[trade association]] - sponsored the North American Young Generation in Nuclear 501(c)(6) on outreach projects.

The 19 professional divisions and groups are as follows:

==Publication==

The Society publishes the magazines ''Nuclear News'' and ''Radwaste Solutions'' and three technical journals: ''Nuclear Science and Engineering'', ''Nuclear Technology'' and ''[[nuclear fusion|Fusion]] Science and Technology.''  The ANS holds an [http://www.ans.org/meetings/c_1 annual meeting] in June and a [http://www.ans.org/meetings/c_1 winter meeting] in November, with participants from around the world.  Through its professional divisions and local sections, ANS conducts separate [http://www.ans.org/meetings/c_2 topical meetings], covering specific subjects in-depth.

== Membership==

To be eligible for professional membership a person must be engaged in activities in one or more of the fields of [[nuclear science]] and engineering or allied fields and shall meet at least one of the following requirements:
#Hold an [[Academic degree|academic]] or [[associates degree]] from a recognized institution in the field of nuclear science or engineering or allied fields (or equivalent as approved by the Membership Committee)
#Have no less than one year of responsible technical or scientific experience in the field of nuclear science or engineering or allied fields.
#Have a recognized record of attainment or leadership in some science, profession, or branch of industry relevant to nuclear science and technology.

To be eligible for student membership, a person must be regularly enrolled and pursuing an approved scientific or engineering curriculum in a school having, or eligible to have, a Student Section of the Society, or in the [[Naval Nuclear Power School]], or in a similar institution approved by the Board of Directors.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ans.oh
rg/memberinfo/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Honors and awards==
ANS believes that a well-recognized{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}} honors and awards program is a key attribute of any highly respected technical/professional society. Currently with more than 35 prestigious awards, the American Nuclear Society has a vigorous program to honor outstanding achievement and meritorious service in the various fields served by our Society. With these honors and awards programs, ANS recognizes the accomplishments of nuclear science and technology professionals.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ans.org/honors/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scholarships==

ANS helps students complete their post-high school education and prepare for careers in nuclear science and technology (NS&amp;T). Among the programs available is the long list of ANS Scholarships for those looking for funding opportunities.
More than 20 scholarships named after pioneers and leaders in NS&amp;T and other general scholarships are awarded each year to students with outstanding academic credentials. Special scholarships are available to students who have significant economic needs in order to pursue degrees in NS&amp;T. In addition to the scholarships for students entering their sophomore year and higher in college, ANS also provides scholarships to incoming freshmen.

[[File:Angles of triangle add up to 180 degrees.png]]

As an example, a proof of the theorem on the [[sum of angles of a triangle]] can be done by adding a straight line parallel to one of the triangle sides (passing through the opposite vertex).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Mathematical People: Profiles and Interviews|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1eHqBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA15|isbn=978-1-4398-6517-0|pages=15–16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the adding of auxiliary constructs can often make a problem obvious, it's not at all obvious to discover the helpful construct among all the possibilities, and for this reason many prefer to use more systematic methods for the solution of geometric problems (such as the coordinate method, which requires much less ingenuity).

}}

'''Blade pitch''' or simply '''pitch''' refers to turning the [[angle of attack]] of the blades of a [[propeller (aircraft)|propeller]] or [[helicopter]] [[Helicopter rotor|rotor]] into or out of the wind to control the production or absorption of power. [[Wind turbine]]s use this to adjust the rotation speed and the generated power. A [[propeller]] of a ship uses this effect to control the ship's speed without changing the rotation of the shaft and to increase the efficiency of streaming fluids.

== Aircraft ==
[[Image:Prop feather.jpg|thumb|A propeller blade in feathered position]]
In aircraft, blade pitch is usually described as "coarse" for a greater horizontal blade angle, and "fine" for a more vertical blade angle.  For an aircraft that is stationary the angle of pitch of each blade of a propeller fitted to that aircraft equates to the angle of attack.

Blade pitch is normally described in units of distance/rotation assuming no slip.

Blade pitch acts much like the gearing of the final drive of a car.  Low pitch yields good low speed acceleration (and [[climb rate]] in an aircraft) while high pitch optimizes high speed performance and economy.

A propeller blade's "lift", or its thrust, depends on the angle of attack combined with its speed.  Because the velocity of a propeller blade varies from the hub to the tip, it is of twisted form in order for the thrust to remain approximately constant along the length of the blade; this is called washout. This is typical of all but the crudest propellers.

It is quite common in aircraft for the propeller to be designed to [[Propeller (aircraft)#Propeller control|vary pitch]] in flight, to give optimum thrust over the maximum amount of the aircraft's speed range, from takeoff and climb to cruise.

=== Helicopter ===
In [[helicopter]]s the pitch control changes the angle of attack of the [[Helicopter rotor|rotor]] blades and thus the vertical acceleration or climb rate of the vehicle. This control is also called ''collective'' as distinct from the ''cyclic'' control for lateral movement. The collective blade setting is mostly achieved through vertical movement of the [[Swashplate (helicopter)|swashplate]].

=== Feathering ===
[[Propeller (aircraft)#Feathering|Feathering]] the blades of a propeller means to increase their angle of pitch by turning the blades to be parallel to the airflow. This minimizes drag from a stopped propeller following an engine failure in flight.

== Wind turbines ==
[[File:Kamaoa wind farm 598702649 9a05e61fc1 b.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Decommissioned wind turbines of the Kama'oa Wind Farm in [[Ka Lae|Ka Lae/South Point]], [[Hawaii (island)|Hawaii]] awaiting removal, with rotors stopped and blades feathered.]]
Blade pitch control is a feature of nearly all large modern horizontal-axis wind turbines. While operating, a wind turbine's control system adjusts the blade pitch to keep the rotor speed within operating limits as the wind speed changes. Feathering the blades stops the rotor during emergency shutdowns, or whenever the wind speed exceeds the maximum rated speed. During construction and maintenance of wind turbines, the blades are usually feathered to reduce unwanted rotational torque in the event of wind gusts.

== Boating ==

=== Measurement ===
In boating, blade pitch is measured in the number of inches of forward propulsion through the water for one complete revolution of the propeller. For example, a propeller with a 12" pitch when rotated once, will propel the vessel 12" ahead. Note that this is the theoretical maximum distance; in reality, due to "slip" between the propeller and the water, the actual distance propelled will invariably be less.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.boatus.com/boattech/articles/propellers.asp&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Variable Pitch ===
Some [[composite propeller]]s have interchangeable blades, which enables the blade pitch to be adjusted. Changing the blade pitch in different elevations can be very beneficial to a boater. Typically, using a lower pitch will provide better acceleration and a higher pitch enables better top end speed.

=== Rowing (sport) ===
In rowing, blade pitch is the inclination of the blade towards the stern of the boat during the drive phase of the rowing stroke.  Without correct blade pitch, a blade would have a tendency to dive too deep, or pop out of the water and/or cause difficulties with balancing on the recovery phase of the rowing stroke.

A '''carbon audit regime''' is a means of [[accounting]] for quantifiable [[Mitigation of global warming|greenhouse gas control]] efforts.  It establishes that the claimed reductions in emissions or enhancements of [[carbon dioxide sinks|carbon sinks]], has actually occurred and is stable.

The [[United Kingdom|UK]] is the only nation in the world that presently has such a regime.

The '''Coal Exchange''' (also known as the '''Exchange Building''') is a historical building in [[Cardiff]], [[Wales]].

It was built in 1888 as the '''Coal and Shipping Exchange''' to be used as a market floor and office building for trading in coal in Cardiff, then a hub of the global coal trade. It is situated in [[Mount Stuart Square]] in [[Butetown]], and was for many years the hub of the city's prosperous shipping industry. 

It later became a music venue, with offices remaining in use in the West Wing, before being closed indefinitely in 2013 due to building safety issues. Following a series of proposals to demolish the building, Cardiff Council purchased the Coal Exchange. In 2016 the property was sold to Liverpool based hospitality company Signature Living, which began a programme of restoration and conversion of the building into a hotel. 

The first phase of this renovation was completed with the opening of the first thirty rooms in April 2017, with further rooms added as renovations continued. As of August 2018, renovations were still ongoing to the rear areas of the building, over 90 rooms had been completed, and the hotel restaurant had opened.

==History==
===Construction and Early History===
[[File:Coal ships tied up at Cardiff Docks.jpg|thumb|left|Coal ships tied up at Cardiff Docks in the 1910s]]
Before the Coal Exchange was built in Mount Stuart Square, the area was a residential square with a central garden. It was taken over by commerce as the city grew in prosperity. Built to provide a dedicated location for merchants and traders to sell coal, it followed construction of buildings of a similar function in [[Royal Exchange, London|London]], [[Liverpool Cotton Exchange Building|Liverpool]] and [[Royal Exchange, Manchester|Manchester]].&lt;ref name=Cotswold&gt;[http://planning.cardiff.gov.uk/online-applications/files/3099039BBD74C55EBE4147911531EA90/pdf/17_02124_MJR-THE_COAL_EXCHANGE_MOUNT_STUART_SQUARE_CARDIFF_-_CONSERVATION_MANAGEMENT_PLAN6352-1951448.pdf The Cardiff Coal Exchange: Conservation Management Plan], Edwards, Zoe, Cotswold Archaeology July 2017&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to its construction, coal merchants used to chalk up the changing prices of coal on slates outside their offices or struck deals in the local public houses.&lt;ref name="BBC"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/wales/southeast/sites/coast/pages/7.shtml |title=South East Wales &amp;#124; Coal Exchange and Mountstuart Square |publisher=BBC |date=4 November 2009 |accessdate=10 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was built and opened in stages, the central trading hall and east block completed first. The trading hall was a large central space around which suites of offices were located.  [[London and Provincial Bank|The London and Provincial Banking Company]] occupied the majority of the north side.&lt;ref name="Cotswold"/&gt;

As Cardiff became the biggest coal port in the world, the building was constructed between 1884 and 1888 by [[Edwin Seward]] as a base from which to conduct trade negotiations regarding the [[South Wales Coalfield|coal mines]] of the [[South Wales Valleys]] – most of which was shipped to [[Cardiff]] for distribution.

The building played an important role in the industrial Cardiff of the 19th century.  Paired Corinthian columns, an oak balcony, and rich wood panelling adorn the trading hall, which was reconstructed by Edwin Seward in 1911.&lt;ref name="history"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://coalexchange.co.uk/history/ |title=History |publisher=Coal Exchange |accessdate=27 October 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161022182736/http://coalexchange.co.uk/history/ |archivedate=22 October 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following its opening, coal owners, ship owners and their agents met daily on the floor of the trading hall where agreements were made by word of mouth and telephone. During the peak trading hour of midday to one o'clock, the floor might have as many as 200 men gesticulating and shouting. It was estimated that up to 10,000 people would pass in and out of the building each day. At one time the price of the world's coal was determined here.&lt;ref name="BBC"/&gt; It was at the Coal Exchange that the first ever [[GBP|£]]1,000,000 deal was agreed&lt;ref name="history"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-south-east-wales-37353705 "Derelict railway building on top 10 at-risk buildings"], BBC News, 14 September 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; in 1904.&lt;ref name="talkstosecure"&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-south-east-wales-25667470 "Talks to secure future of Coal Exchange in Cardiff Bay"], BBC News, 20 January 2014. Retrieved 27 October 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; The building interior was lavishly refurbished in 1912 by Edwin Seward, and reopened as the ‘New Exchange Building’. In 1915, an extension was added to the southern section, connected to the trading hall.&lt;ref name="Cotswold"/&gt;

===Post-war period===
[[File:Coal Exchange 1920s.jpg|thumb|The southern entrance, with now demolished extension, 1920s]]
Cardiff's reliance on coal made the Bute Docks highly vulnerable to any downturn in the demand for it. With the end of the war the docks went into further decline. The Coal exchange closed in 1958 and coal exports came to an end in 1964. The southern extension was demolished in the 1970s. The building became Grade II* [[Listed buildings|listed]] in 1975.&lt;ref name="BLB"&gt;[http://www.britishlistedbuildings.co.uk/wa-14015-cardiff-exchange-building-butetown Cardiff Exchange Building, Butetown], British Listed Buildings. Retrieved 21 March 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1979 the Coal Exchange was earmarked as a future home of the proposed [[Welsh devolution referendum, 1979|Welsh Assembly]]&lt;ref name="BBC"/&gt; and a heavily reinforced underground carpark was constructed (also envisaged to act as a nuclear shelter)&lt;ref name=belowthebridge&gt;{{Citation|last1=Evans |first1=Catherine |last2=Dodsworth |first2=Steve |last3=Barnett |first3=Julie |title=Below the Bridge: A photo-historical survey of Cardiff's docklands to 1983 |place=Cardiff |publisher=[[National Museum of Wales Cardiff]] |pages=37–38 |year=1984 |isbn=0-7200-0288-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; but the plan for devolution was rejected by the Welsh people in a referendum. In 1983 the building was considered as a headquarters for the [[Welsh language]] television station, [[S4C]],&lt;ref name=belowthebridge /&gt; though this also failed to take off. The Exchange Hall was used with great regularity during this period as a [[Location shooting|filming location]] for various parts of the entertainment industry, for example the BBC drama ''Bevan''.&lt;ref name=belowthebridge /&gt;

===Re-opening and closure===

In 1988 the building was re-acquired and subsequently completely refurbished in 2001 to turn it into a major venue. The venue hosted acts such as the [[Arctic Monkeys]], [[Manic Street Preachers]], [[Ocean Colour Scene]], [[Stereophonics]], [[Van Morrison]] and [[Biffy Clyro]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.openmicuk.co.uk/venues/Cardiff-Coal-Exchange |title=Open Mic &amp;#124; Cardiff Coal Exchange |publisher=Openmicuk.co.uk |accessdate=10 June 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120302044134/http://www.openmicuk.co.uk/venues/Cardiff-Coal-Exchange |archivedate=2 March 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Coal Exchange closed on 7 August 2013 as a result of building safety issues. With the subsequent liquidation of the company which owned it in 2014, ownership of the Coal Exchange passed to the Crown Estate. It then became the subject of efforts to preserve the historic fabric of the building by the not-for-profit organisation Save the Coal Exchange Limited.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://savethecoalexchange.com/|website=Save the Coal Exchange|accessdate=24 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2015, Welsh Government Economy Minister Edwina Hart commissioned a feasibility study into future re-use of the building. In May 2015 it was confirmed that the exchange would be used for filming of the remake of ''[[The Crow]]''.  In 2016, filmmaker [[Nick Broomfield]] visited the building as part of his documentary ''Going Going Gone'', which investigated the deterioration and heritage of the Coal Exchange.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/may/01/nick-broomfield-fascinated-buildings-history-liverpool-cardiff Nick Broomfield: ‘I’ve always been fascinated by buildings and history’] ''The Guardian'', article 1 May 2016&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Going Going Gone|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5639364/|publisher=Internet Movie Database|accessdate=22 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Design==
[[File:The clock, Coal Exchange, Cardiff.jpg|thumb|Clock inside the trading hall|260x260px]]
The building is constructed largely in limestone, in the French Renaissance style.  The exterior is made of pale Corsham stone on three sides, with yellow brick on the western elevation. The roof is slate, topped with multiple chimneys mainly in yellow brick.  Its style was derived from French Renaissance models. The main entrance front faces south. The building is made up of three storeys and basement, plus attic storeys in the central pedimented 'frontispiece', with a hipped pavilion roof. The entrance is guarded by a pair of fluted Corinthian columns, and topped by a floral relief in a triangular pediment surmounted by Royal Arms. On the north east corner, steps lead up to a projecting porch which housed Barclays Bank, resident here since building opened.&lt;ref name="BLB"/&gt;

The interior retains an entrance hall with a Jacobethan style moulded plaster ceiling, panelled walls, and woodblock and inlay floor. At the rear are two lions on high plinths supporting clock faces showing times of Cardiff high tides. The central Coal and Shipping Hall dominates the building, surrounded by galleried tiers, in Jacobethan style dark wood. A false ceiling has reduced the height to 2 storeys, hiding a centrally glazed roof.&lt;ref name="BLB"/&gt;

==Access==
Coal Exchange is served by [[Cardiff Bay railway station]] and [[Cardiff Bus]] service 7, 8, 35, and [[Baycar]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.coalexchange.co.uk/location.htm |title=Location |publisher=Coal Exchange |accessdate=10 June 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120724025440/http://www.coalexchange.co.uk/location.htm |archivedate=24 July 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7187">'''Coalbed methane extraction''' (CBM extraction) is a method for extracting [[methane]] from a [[coal]] deposit.

==Basic principles==
Methane [[Adsorption|adsorbed]] into a solid coal matrix (coal macerals) will be released if the coal seam is depressurised.  Methane may be extracted by [[well drilling|drilling wells]] into the coal seam. The goal is to decrease the water pressure by pumping water from the well.  The decrease in pressure allows methane to desorb from the coal and flow as a gas up the well to the surface. Methane is then compressed and piped to market.

The objective is to avoid putting methane into the water line, but allow it to flow up the backside of the well (casing) to the compressor station. If the water level is pumped too low during dewatering, methane may travel up the tubing into the water line causing the well to become "gassy". Although methane may be recovered in a water-gas separator at the surface, pumping water and gas is inefficient and can cause pump wear and breakdown.

==Areas with CBM extraction==
Tens of thousands of methane wells have been drilled, and extensive support facilities such as roads, pipelines, and compressors have been installed for CBM extraction in the [[Powder River Basin]] of northeast [[Wyoming]] and southeast [[Montana]] and now in India at West Bengal- Ranigunj, Panagarh etc. Seven percent of the [[natural gas]] (methane) currently produced in the [[United States]] comes from CBM extraction. Methane from coalbed reservoirs can be recovered economically, but disposal of water is an environmental concern.

There are also sites in Central Scotland at Letham Moss.{{cn|date=November 2014}}
 
Most gas in coal is stored on the internal surfaces of organic matter. Because of its large internal surface area, coal stores 6 to 7 times more gas than the equivalent rock volume of a conventional gas reservoir. Gas content generally increases with coal rank, with depth of burial of the coal bed, and with reservoir pressure. Fractures, or cleats, within coal beds are usually filled with water. Deeper coal beds contain less water, but that water is more saline. Removing water from the coal bed reduces pressure and releases methane. Large amounts of water, sometimes saline [[brine]], are produced from [[coalbed methane]] wells. The greatest water volumes are produced during the early stages of production. Environmentally acceptable disposal of brine is a major cost factor for economic methane production. Fresh water may be discharged on the surface, but brine is usually injected into rock at a depth where the salinity of the injected brine is less than [[connate fluids]] of the host rock. Evaporation of water for recovery of potentially salable solid residues might be feasible in regions having high evaporation rates.&lt;ref&gt;[http://energy.usgs.gov/factsheets/Coalbed/coalmeth.html Coalbed methane] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060918195447/http://energy.usgs.gov/factsheets/Coalbed/coalmeth.html |date=2006-09-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Measuring the gas content of coal ==
Coal bed gas content measurements are commonly used in mine safety as well as coal bed methane resource assessment and recovery applications. Gas content determination techniques generally fall into two categories: (1) direct methods which actually measure the volume of methane released from a coal sample sealed into a [[desorption]] canister and (2) indirect methods based on empirical correlations, or laboratory derived [[sorption isotherm]] methane storage capacity data. Laboratory sorption isotherms provide information about the storage capacity of a coal sampleif these are measured under geological realistic pressure and temperature conditions. Thus, the maximum gas content which can be expected for methane recovery can be assessed from such laboratory isotherm measurements.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rubotherm.com/investigation-of-enhanced-coal-bed-methane-ecbm-processes.html ''Investigation of Enhanced Coal Bed Methane (ECBM) Processes - Gravimetric Adsorption Measurements under Realistic Conditions''] &lt;/ref&gt;

The total gas content by the indirect methods is based on the [[empirical formula]] given by Meinser and Kim. The quantity of gas is determined by Meisner and Kim formula with using the moisture content, volatile content, volume of methane adsorbed on wet coal, fixed carbon, thickness of coal and temperature.
&lt;br /&gt;Meinser (1984) observed that the amount of methane gas (VCH4) is related to volatile matter (daf).

&lt;br /&gt;V&lt;sub&gt;CH4&lt;/sub&gt; = −325.6 × log (V.M/37.8)

&lt;br /&gt;Estimation of ''[[in situ]]'' gas content of the coal will be evaluated by using Kim's (Kim 1977) equation 

&lt;br /&gt;V = (100 −M − A) /100 × [ Vw /Vd ]  [K(P)&lt;sup&gt;N&lt;/sup&gt; - (b × T)]
&lt;br /&gt;Where,
&lt;br /&gt;V = Volume of methane gas adsorbed (cc/g) 
&lt;br /&gt;M = Moisture content (%) 
&lt;br /&gt;A = Ash content (%).
&lt;br /&gt;Vw/Vd =   1/(0.25 ×M + 1)
&lt;br /&gt;Vw = Volume of gas adsorbed on wet coal (cc/g) 
&lt;br /&gt;Vd = Volume of gas adsorbed on dry coal (cc/g)
&lt;br /&gt;The values of K and N depend on the rank of the coal and can be expressed in terms of ratio of fixed carbon (FC) to Volatile matter(VM)
&lt;br /&gt;K = 0.8 (F.C /V.M) + 5.6
Where
&lt;br /&gt;F.C = Fixed carbon (%)
&lt;br /&gt;VM = Volatile matter (%)
&lt;br /&gt;N = Composition of coal (for most bituminous coals, N = (0.39 - 0.013 × K)
&lt;br /&gt;b =Adsorption constant due to temperature change (cc/g/◦C).
&lt;br /&gt;T = Geothermal Gradient × (h/ 100) + To
&lt;br /&gt;T = Temperature at given depth
&lt;br /&gt;To = Ground temperature
&lt;br /&gt;h = Depth (m)

&lt;br /&gt;'''Estimation of methane content in coal seams by Karol curve'''

&lt;br /&gt;In the absence measured methane content of coal beds, and production data from coal bed methane wells, gas content can be estimated using the Eddy curve. Eddy and others constructed a series of curves estimating maximum producible methane content of coal bed as a function of depth and [[coal rank|rank]].
&lt;br /&gt;The estimation of methane content of a coal bed is determined from the Eddy curve by locating the average depth of each coal seam on the depth axis. A normal line is extended upward from the depth axis (feet) to intersect the specific coal rank curves. A line from the point on the curve is extended normal to the lost and desorbed gas axis(cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;/gm). The intersection of the line and the axis is the estimated methane content of the coal seam.

== Interpretation of Ash analysis ==
[[Ash (analytical chemistry)|Ash]] is an important indicator of [[Clastic rock|clastic]] input, derived from [[Marine (ocean)|marine]] or [[fluvial]] deposition of [[clay]], [[silt]], and [[sand]] during [[peat]] development. Outcrop ash content appears to be less than ash content of subsurface samples. Lower ash contents of outcrop samples may be due to coal deposits being up [[Strike and dip|dip]] and further away from a marine influence than samples down-dip.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1976">'''Congruent melting''' occurs during [[melting]] of a compound when the composition of the liquid that forms is the same as the composition of the solid. It can be contrasted with [[incongruent melting]]. This generally happens in two-[[Component (thermodynamics)|component]] systems. To take a general case, let A and B be the two components and AB a stable solid compound formed by their chemical combination. If we draw a [[phase diagram]] for the system, we notice that there are three solid phases, namely A, B and compound AB. Accordingly, there will be three fusion or freezing point curves AC, BE and CDE for the three solid phases. In the phase diagram, we can notice that the top point D of the phase diagram is the congruent melting point of the compound AB because the solid and liquid phases now have the same composition. Evidently, at this [[temperature]], the two-component system has become a one-component system because both solid and liquid phases contains only the compound AB.&lt;ref&gt;Elements of Physical Chemistry, Puri-Sharma-Pathania&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Atkins' Physical Chemistry 8th edition by Peter Atkins and Julio De Paula&lt;/ref&gt;

 [[File:Formation_of_compound_with_congruent_melting_point.jpg|thumb|Phase Diagram for the Formation of a compound with congruent Melting Point]]Congruent melting point represents a definite temperature just like the melting points of pure components. In the phase diagram, the congruent melting point D of compound AB lies above the melting points of pure components A and B. But it is not necessarily true. There are different types of systems known in which the  congruent melting point is observed to be less than melting points of pure components.
This happens for inter-metallic compounds.
For example, MgSi&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

The '''Dauletabad–Sarakhs–Khangiran pipeline''' (also known as '''Dauletabad–Salyp Yar pipeline''') is a natural gas [[pipeline transport|pipeline]] from the [[Dauletabad gas field]] in Turkmenistan to Khangiran in Iran, where it is connected with the [[Iran Gas Trunkline]] system.  It is significant as it allows the diversification of Turkmenistan's gas export routes, doubling the nation's export of gas to Iran.&lt;ref name="BBC"/&gt;  For Iran, the pipeline allows the country to deal with gas shortages in its northern regions, and to improve its reputation as a trade partner in the [[Caspian region]].&lt;ref name=rferl060110&gt;

[[File:Desert Dawn.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Late summer dawn over the [[Mojave desert]], [[California]]]]
[[File:Twilight description full day.svg|thumb|300px|Dawn is sometimes considered the beginning of morning [[twilight]] (as depicted here), sometimes the period of twilight, and sometimes the time of sunrise.]]

'''Dawn''', from an [[Old English]] verb ''dagian'': "to become day", is the time that marks the beginning of [[twilight]] before [[sunrise]]. It is recognized by the [[diffuse sky radiation|appearance]] of indirect [[sunlight]] being [[Raleigh scattering|scattered]] in the [[atmosphere]], when the centre of the [[Sun]]'s disc reaches 18° below the [[horizon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The different types of twilight|url=https://www.timeanddate.com/astronomy/different-types-twilight.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; This dawn twilight period will last until sunrise (when the Sun's upper limb breaks the horizon), as the [[light scattering|diffused light]] becomes [[daylight|direct sunlight]].

[[File:Twilight-dawn subcategories.svg|thumb|right|300px|Civil, nautical, and astronomical dawn, when defined as the beginning time of the corresponding twilight&lt;ref name="Low precision formulae"&gt;{{cite journal|bibcode=1979ApJS...41..391V|last=Van Flandern|first=T.|author2=K.

==Types of dawn==
Dawn begins with the first sight of lightness in the morning, and continues until the sun breaks the horizon. This morning twilight ''before sunrise'', is divided into three categories depending on the amount of sunlight that is present in the sky, which is determined by the angular distance of the centre of the Sun ([[degree (angle)|degree]]s below the horizon) in the [[morning]]. The categories are named: ''astronomical'', ''nautical'', and ''civil'' '''dawn'''.

=== Astronomical dawn ===
{{Main|Twilight#Astronomical twilight}}
Astronomical twilight begins when the sky is no longer completely dark after astronomical dawn. This occurs when the Sun is 18 [[degree (angle)|degree]]s below the horizon in the morning.&lt;ref name="NOAA_Astro_Terms"/&gt; At this point a very small portion of the sun's rays illuminate the sky and the fainter stars begin to disappear. Astronomical dawn is often indistinguishable from night, especially in areas with light pollution. Astronomical dawn marks the beginning of astronomical twilight, which lasts until nautical dawn.&lt;ref name="timeanddate.com"&gt;https://www.timeanddate.com/astronomy/dawn.html&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Nautical dawn ===
[[File:Dawn 1.jpg|thumb|right|Nautical dawn in [[Joshua Tree, California]], [[United States]]]]
{{Main|Twilight#Nautical twilight}}
Nautical twilight begins when there is enough illumination for sailors to distinguish the horizon at sea but the sky is too dark to perform outdoor activities (except with artificial light).  Formally, nautical twilight begins when the Sun is 12 degrees below the horizon in the morning. The sky becomes light enough to clearly distinguish it from land and water. Nautical dawn marks the start of nautical twilight, which lasts until civil dawn.&lt;ref name="timeanddate.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NOAA_Astro_Terms"/&gt;

=== Civil dawn ===
[[File:Civil Dawn.jpg|thumb|Beginning of morning civil twilight in [[southern California]], [[United States]]]]

{{Main|Twilight#Civil twilight}}
Civil twilight begins when there is enough light for most objects to be distinguishable, so that some outdoor activities, but not all, can commence.  Formally, civil dawn occurs when the [[Sun]] is 6 degrees below the horizon in the morning.&lt;ref name="NOAA_Astro_Terms"&gt;{{cite web
 | url = http://www.srh.noaa.gov/ffc/?n=gloss3
 | title = Astronomical Terms
 | author = [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]]
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If the sky is clear, it is blue colored, and if there is some cloud or haze, there can be bronze, orange and yellow colours. Some bright [[star]]s and [[planet]]s such as Venus and Jupiter are visible to the naked eye at civil dawn. This moment marks the start of civil twilight, which lasts until sunrise.&lt;ref name="timeanddate.com"/&gt;

==Effects of latitude==
The duration of the [[twilight]] period (e.g. between astronomical dawn and [[sunrise]]) varies greatly depending on the observer's [[latitude]]: from a little over 70 minutes at the [[Equator]], to many hours in the [[polar region]]s.

===Equator===
The period of twilight is shortest at the [[Equator]], where the [[equinox]] Sun rises due east and sets due west, at a [[perpendicular|right angle]] to the horizon. Each stage of twilight (civil, nautical, and astronomical) lasts only 24 minutes. From anywhere on Earth, the twilight period is shortest around the equinoxes and longest on the [[solstice]]s.

===Polar regions===
{{see also|Midnight sun}}

[[Daytime]] becomes longer as the [[summer solstice]] approaches, while [[night]]time gets longer as the [[winter solstice]] approaches. This can have a potential impact on the times and durations of dawn and dusk. This effect is more pronounced closer to the poles, where the Sun rises at the vernal equinox and sets at the autumn equinox, with a long period of twilight, lasting for a few weeks.&lt;!--Is it really a few weeks?--&gt;

The [[polar circle]] (at 66°34&amp;prime; north or south) is defined as the lowest latitude at which the Sun does not set at the [[summer solstice]]. Therefore, the [[angular radius]] of the polar circle is equal to the angle between Earth's equatorial plane and the [[ecliptic]] plane. This period of time with no [[sunset]] lengthens closer to the pole.

Near the summer solstice, latitudes higher than 54°34&amp;prime; get no darker than nautical twilight; the "darkness of the night" varies greatly at these latitudes.

At latitudes higher than about 60°34, summer nights get no darker than civil twilight. This period of "bright nights" is longer at higher latitudes.

====Example====
{{Refimprove section|date=July 2013 }}
[[File:New Dawn at La Silla.jpg|thumb|Dawn at [[La Silla Observatory]], [[Chile]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=New Dawn at La Silla|url=http://www.eso.org/public/images/potw1507a/|accessdate=27 February 2015|work=ESO Picture of the Week|agency=European Southern Observatory}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Around the [[summer solstice]], Glasgow, Scotland at 55°51′ N, and Copenhagen, Denmark at 55°40′ N, get a few hours of "night feeling". Oslo, Norway at 59°56′ N, and Stockholm, Sweden at 59°19′ N, seem very bright when the Sun is below the horizon. When the sun gets 9.0 to 9.5 degrees below the horizon (at summer solstice this is at latitudes 57°30′–57°00′), the zenith gets dark even on cloud-free nights (if there is no full moon), and even the brightest stars are clearly visible in a large majority of the sky.

==Mythology and religion==
Many [[Proto-Indo-European religion|Indo-European mythologies]] have a [[dawn goddess]], separate from the male [[Solar deity]], her name deriving from [[PIE]] ''[[Hausos|*h&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;ausos-]]'', derivations of which include Greek [[Eos]], Roman [[Aurora (mythology)|Aurora]] and Indian [[Ushas]]. Also related is Lithuanian [[Aušrinė]], and possibly a Germanic ''[[Eostre|*Austrōn-]]'' (whence the term ''[[Easter]]''). In [[Sioux]] mythology, [[Anpao]] is an entity with two faces.

The [[Hinduism|Hindu]] dawn deity [[Ushas]] is female, whereas [[Surya]], the Sun, and [[Aruṇa]], the Sun's charioteer, are male. [[Ushas]] is one of the most prominent [[Rigvedic deities]]. The time of dawn is also referred to as the Brahmamuhurtham ([[Brahma]] is god of creation and muhurtham is a Hindu unit of time), and is considered an ideal time to perform spiritual activities, including meditation and yoga. In some parts of India, both Usha and Pratyusha (dusk) are worshiped along with the Sun during the festival of [[Chhath]].

[[Prime (liturgy)|Prime]] is the fixed time of prayer of the traditional [[Canonical hours|Divine Office]] (Canonical Hours) in [[Christian liturgy]], said at the first hour of daylight.

In [[Islam]], astronomical dawn ([[Arabic language|Arabic]] ''fajr'') is the time of the first prayer of the day, and the beginning of the daily fast during [[Ramadan]].

In [[Judaism]], the question of how to calculate dawn ([[Hebrew]] Alos/{{not a typo|Alot}} HaShachar, or Alos/{{not a typo|Alot}}) is posed by the [[Talmud]],&lt;ref&gt;Pesachim 94a&lt;/ref&gt; as it has many ramifications for Jewish law (such as the possible start time for certain daytime commandments, like prayer). The simple reading of the Talmud is that dawn takes place 72 minutes before sunrise. Others, including the [[Vilna Gaon]], have the understanding that the Talmud's timeframe for dawn was referring specifically to an equinox day in Mesopotamia, and is therefore teaching that dawn should be calculated daily as commencing when the sun is 16.1 degrees below the horizon. The longstanding practice among most [[Sephardic]] Jews is to follow the first opinion, while many [[Ashkenazi]] Jews follow the latter view.

[[File:Royal Jordanian Airlines Boeing 787-8 (JY-BAA) arrives London Heathrow 11Apr2015 arp.jpg|thumb|Human-invented flight: a [[Royal Jordanian Airlines]] [[Boeing 787]]]]
'''Flight''' is the process by which an [[object (physics)|object]] [[Motion (physics)|moves]] through an [[atmosphere]] (or beyond it, as in the case of [[spaceflight]]) without contact with the surface. This can be achieved by generating [[Lift (force)|aerodynamic lift]] associated with [[Air propulsion|propulsive thrust]], [[Lighter than air|aerostatically]] using [[buoyancy]], or by [[ballistics|ballistic]] movement.

Many things can fly, from natural aviators such as [[bird]]s, [[bat]]s, and [[insect]]s, to human inventions like [[aircraft]], including [[airplane]]s, [[helicopter]]s, [[balloon]]s, and [[rocket]]s which may carry [[spacecraft]].

The engineering aspects of flight are the purview of [[aerospace engineering]] which is subdivided into [[aeronautics]], the study of vehicles that travel through the air, and [[astronautics]], the study of vehicles that travel through space, and in [[ballistics]], the study of the flight of projectiles.

==Types of flight==
===Buoyant flight===

{{main article|Aerostat}}
[[File:Goodyear-blimp.jpg|thumb|An airship flies because the upward force, from air displacement, is equal to or greater than the force of gravity]]
Humans have managed to construct lighter than air vehicles that raise off the ground and fly, due to their [[buoyancy]] in air.

An '''aerostat''' is a system that remains aloft primarily through the use of [[buoyancy]] to give an aircraft the same overall density as air. Aerostats include [[balloon (aircraft)|free balloons]], [[airship]]s, and [[moored balloon]]s. An aerostat's main structural component is its [[wikt:envelope|envelope]], a lightweight [[skin]] that encloses a volume of [[lifting gas]]&lt;ref&gt;Walker 2000, p. 541. Quote: the gas-bag of a balloon or airship.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Coulson-Thomas 1976, p. 281. Quote: fabric enclosing gas-bags of airship.&lt;/ref&gt; to provide [[buoyancy]], to which other components are attached.

Aerostats are so named because they use "aerostatic" lift, a [[buoyant]] force that does not require lateral movement through the surrounding air mass to effect a lifting force. By contrast, [[Aircraft#Heavier than air .E2.80.93 aerodynes|aerodynes]] primarily use [[aerodynamic]] [[lift (force)|lift]], which requires the lateral movement of at least some part of the [[aircraft]] through the surrounding air mass.

===Aerodynamic flight===

====Unpowered flight versus powered flight====
{{main article| Unpowered flight}}
Some things that fly do not generate propulsive thrust through the air, for example, the [[flying squirrel]]. This is termed [[gliding (flight)|gliding]]. Some other things can exploit rising air to climb such as [[Bird of prey|raptors]] (when gliding) and [[glider (sailplane)|man-made sailplane gliders]]. This is termed [[Lift (soaring)|soaring]]. However most other birds and all [[powered aircraft]] need a source of [[propulsion]] to climb. This is termed powered flight.

====Animal flight====

[[File:Tau Emerald inflight edit.jpg|thumb|Tau emerald [[dragonfly]]]]
[[File:Kea in Flight MC.jpg|thumb|[[Kea]]]]
{{Main article|Flying and gliding animals}}

The only groups of [[Flying and gliding animals|living things that use powered flight]] are [[bird]]s, [[insect]]s, and [[bat]]s, while many groups have evolved gliding. The extinct [[Pterosaur]]s, an [[Order (biology)|order]] of reptiles contemporaneous with the [[dinosaur]]s, were also very successful flying animals. Each of these groups' [[wing]]s [[evolution|evolved]] [[Convergent evolution|independently]]. The wings of the flying vertebrate groups are all based on the forelimbs, but differ significantly in structure; those of insects are hypothesized to be highly modified versions of structures that form gills in most other groups of [[arthropod]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Averof, Michalis. [http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v385/n6617/abs/385627a0.html "Evolutionary origin of insect wings from ancestral gills."] ''Nature'', Volume 385, Issue 385, February 1997, pp. 627–630.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Bat]]s are the only [[mammal]]s capable of sustaining level flight (see ''[[bat flight]]'').&lt;ref&gt;''World Book Student.'' Chicago: World Book. Retrieved: April 29, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; However, there are several [[Flying squirrel|gliding mammals]] which are able to glide from tree to tree using fleshy membranes between their limbs; some can travel hundreds of meters in this way with very little loss in height. [[Flying frog]]s use greatly enlarged webbed feet for a similar purpose, and there are [[Draco blanfordii|flying lizards]] which fold out their mobile ribs into a pair of flat gliding surfaces. [[Chrysopelea|"Flying" snakes]] also use mobile ribs to flatten their body into an aerodynamic shape, with a back and forth motion much the same as they use on the ground.

[[Flying fish]] can glide using enlarged wing-like fins, and have been observed soaring for hundreds of meters. It is thought that this ability was chosen by [[natural selection]] because it was an effective means of escape from underwater predators. The longest recorded flight of a flying fish was 45 seconds.&lt;ref name=aa&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/7410421.stm "BBC article and video of flying fish."] ''BBC'', May 20, 2008. Retrieved: May 20, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Most [[bird]]s fly (''see [[bird flight]]''), with some exceptions. The largest birds, the [[ostrich]] and the [[emu]], are earthbound, as were the now-extinct [[dodo]]s and the [[Phorusrhacids]], which were the dominant predators of South America in the [[Cenozoic]] era. The non-flying [[penguin]]s have wings adapted for use under water and use the same wing movements for swimming that most other birds use for flight.{{citation needed|date=April 2011}} Most small flightless birds are native to small islands, and lead a lifestyle where flight would offer little advantage.

Among living animals that fly, the [[wandering albatross]] has the greatest wingspan, up to {{convert|3.5|m|ft|abbr=off|sp=us}}; the [[great bustard]] has the greatest weight, topping at {{convert|21|kg|lb|abbr=off}}.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.trumpeterswansociety.org/id.htm "Swan Identification."] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061031082245/http://www.trumpeterswansociety.org/id.htm |date=2006-10-31 }} ''The Trumpeter Swan Society.''

[[File:flight.rob.arp.750pix.jpg|thumb|Mechanical flight: A [[Robinson R22]] Beta [[helicopter]]]]

'''Mechanical flight''' is the use of a [[machine]] to fly. These machines include [[aircraft]] such as [[airplane]]s, [[glider aircraft|gliders]], [[helicopter]]s, [[autogyro]]s, [[airship]]s, [[balloon (aircraft)|balloons]], [[ornithopters]] as well as [[spacecraft]]. [[glider aircraft|Gliders]] are capable of unpowered flight. Another form of mechanical flight is para-sailing where a parachute-like object is pulled by a boat. In an airplane, lift is created by the wings; the shape of the wings of the airplane are designed specially for the type of flight desired. There are different types of wings: tempered, semi-tempered, sweptback, rectangular and elliptical. An aircraft wing is sometimes called an [[airfoil]], which is a device that creates lift when air flows across it.

=====Supersonic=====
{{main article|Supersonic speed}}
Supersonic flight is flight faster than the [[speed of sound]]. Supersonic flight is associated with the formation of [[shock wave]]s that form a [[sonic boom]] that can be heard from the ground,&lt;ref&gt;Bern, Peter. [http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/talking_point/3207470.stm "Concorde: You asked a pilot."] ''BBC'', October 23, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; and is frequently startling. This shockwave takes quite a lot of energy to create and this makes supersonic flight generally less efficient than subsonic flight at about 85% of the speed of sound.

=====Hypersonic=====
{{main article|Hypersonic speed}}
Hypersonic flight is very high speed flight where the heat generated by the compression of the air due to the motion through the air causes chemical changes to the air. Hypersonic flight is achieved by reentering spacecraft such as the [[Space Shuttle]] and [[Soyuz spacecraft|Soyuz]].

===Ballistic===
{{main article|Ballistics}}

====Atmospheric====
Some things generate little or no lift and move only or mostly under the action of momentum, gravity, air drag and in some cases thrust. This is termed ''ballistic flight''. Examples include [[ball]]s, [[archery|arrows]], [[bullet]]s, [[firework]]s etc.

====Spaceflight====
{{main article|Spaceflight}}
Essentially an extreme form of ballistic flight, '''spaceflight''' is the use of [[space technology]] to achieve the flight of [[spacecraft]] into and through [[outer space]]. Examples include [[ballistic missile]]s, [[orbital spaceflight]] etc.

Spaceflight is used in [[space exploration]], and also in commercial activities like [[space tourism]] and [[telecommunications satellite|satellite telecommunications]]. Additional non-commercial uses of spaceflight include [[Space observatory|space observatories]], [[reconnaissance satellite]]s and other [[earth observation satellite]]s.

A spaceflight typically begins with a [[rocket]] [[rocket launch|launch]], which provides the initial thrust to overcome the force of [[gravity]] and propels the spacecraft from the surface of the Earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| url=https://books.google.com/?id=kjVGAAAAYAAJ&amp;q=A+spaceflight+typically+begins+with+a+rocket+launch,+which+provides+the+initial+thrust+to+overcome+the+force+of+gravity | title=Astronautics: A Historical Perspective of Mankind's Efforts to Conquer the Cosmos | last=Spitzmiller | first=Ted | date=2007 | page=467 | publisher=Apogee Books | isbn=9781894959667 | language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Once in space, the motion of a spacecraft—both when unpropelled and when under propulsion—is covered by the area of study called [[astrodynamics]]. Some spacecraft remain in space indefinitely, some disintegrate during [[atmospheric reentry]], and others reach a planetary or lunar surface for landing or impact.

==Physics==
[[File:Luftschiff small.jpg|thumb|Lighter-than-air [[airship]]s are able to fly without any major input of energy]]
{{main article|Aerodynamics}}

There are different approaches to flight. If an object has a lower [[density]] than air, then it is [[buoyancy|buoyant]] and is able to [[aerostat|float in the air]] without expending energy. A [[heavier than air]] craft, known as an [[Aircraft#Heavier than air .80.93 aerodynes|aerodyne]], includes flighted animals and insects, [[fixed-wing aircraft]] and [[rotorcraft]]. Because the craft is heavier than air, it must generate [[lift (force)|lift]] to overcome its [[weight]]. The wind resistance caused by the craft moving through the air is called [[drag (physics)|drag]] and is overcome by [[Air propulsion|propulsive thrust]] except in the case of [[gliding (flight)|gliding]].

Some vehicles also use thrust for flight, for example [[rocket]]s and [[Harrier Jump Jet]]s.

Finally, [[momentum]] dominates the flight of ballistic flying objects.

===Forces===
[[File:Forces2.gif|thumb|Main forces on a heavier-than-air aircraft]]
{{main article|Aerodynamics}}

Forces relevant to flight are&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.grc.nasa.gov/WWW/K-12/airplane/forces.html "Four forces on an aeroplane."] ''NASA.'' Retrieved: January 3, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Air propulsion|Propulsive thrust]] (except in gliders)
* [[Lift (force)|Lift]], created by the reaction to an airflow
* [[Drag (physics)|Drag]], created by aerodynamic [[friction]]
* [[Weight]], created by gravity
* [[Buoyancy]], for lighter than air flight

These forces must be balanced for stable flight to occur.

====Thrust====
{{main|Thrust}}
[[File:aeroforces.svg|thumb|Forces on an [[aerofoil]] cross section]]

A [[fixed-wing aircraft]] generates forward thrust when air is pushed in the direction opposite to flight.  This can be done in several ways including by the spinning blades of a [[Propeller (aircraft)|propeller]], or a rotating [[Mechanical fan|fan]] pushing air out from the back of a [[jet engine]], or by ejecting hot gases from a [[rocket engine]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.grc.nasa.gov/WWW/k-12/airplane/newton3.html&lt;/ref&gt;  The forward thrust is proportional to the [[mass]] of the airstream multiplied by the difference in [[velocity]] of the airstream. Reverse thrust can be generated to aid braking after landing by reversing the pitch of variable-pitch propeller blades, or using a [[Thrust reversal|thrust reverser]] on a jet engine. [[Rotary wing aircraft]] and [[thrust vectoring]] [[V/STOL]] aircraft use engine thrust to support the weight of the aircraft, and vector sum of this thrust fore and aft to control forward speed.

====Lift====
{{main article|lift (force)}}
[[File:Airfoil lift and drag.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Lift is defined as the component of the total aerodynamic force perpendicular to the flow direction, and drag is the component parallel to the flow direction]]
In the context of an [[fluid flow|air flow]] relative to a flying body, the '''lift''' force is the [[Vector (geometric)#Vector components|component]] of the [[aerodynamic force]] that is [[perpendicular]] to the flow direction.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lerc.nasa.gov/WWW/K-12/aerosim/Manual/fsim0020.htm "Definition of lift."] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090203074439/http://www.lerc.nasa.gov/WWW/K-12/aerosim/Manual/fsim0020.htm |date=2009-02-03 }} ''NASA.'' Retrieved: May 6, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Aerodynamic lift results when the wing causes the surrounding air to be deflected - the air then causes a force on the wing in the opposite direction, in accordance with [[Newton's third law of motion]].

Lift is commonly associated with the [[wing]] of an [[Fixed-wing aircraft|aircraft]], although lift is also generated by [[Helicopter rotor|rotors]] on [[rotorcraft]] (which are effectively rotating wings, performing the same function without requiring that the aircraft move forward through the air). While common meanings of the word "[[wikt:lift#English|lift]]" suggest that lift opposes gravity, aerodynamic lift can be in any direction. When an aircraft is [[cruise (flight)|cruising]] for example, lift does oppose gravity, but lift occurs at an angle when climbing, descending or banking. On high-speed cars, the lift force is directed downwards (called "down-force") to keep the car stable on the road.

Lift can also occur in a different way if the air is not still, especially if there is an updraft due to heat ("thermals") or wind blowing along sloping terrain or other meteorological conditions. This form of lift permits [[Lift (soaring)|soaring]] and is particularly important for gliding. It is used by birds and gliders to stay in the air for long periods with little effort.

====Drag====
{{main article|Drag (physics)}}
For a solid object moving through a fluid, the drag is the component of the [[Net force|net]] [[Aerodynamic force|aerodynamic]] or [[hydrodynamics|hydrodynamic]] [[force]] acting opposite to the direction of the movement.&lt;ref&gt;French 1970, p. 210.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ucmp.berkeley.edu/vertebrates/flight/physics.html "Basic flight physics."] ''Berkeley University.'' Retrieved: May 6, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=NASAdrag&gt;[http://www.grc.nasa.gov/WWW/k-12/airplane/drag1.html "What is Drag?"] ''NASA.''

Retrieved: May 6, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, drag opposes the motion of the object, and in a powered vehicle it must be overcome by [[thrust]]. The process which creates lift also causes some drag.

====Lift-to-drag ratio====
[[File:Drag curves for aircraft in flight.svg|thumb|Speed and drag relationships for a typical aircraft]]
{{main article|Lift-to-drag ratio}}
Aerodynamic lift is created by the motion of an aerodynamic object (wing) through the air, which due to its shape and angle deflects the air. For sustained straight and level flight, lift must be equal and opposite to weight. In general, long narrow wings are able deflect a large amount of air at a slow speed, whereas smaller wings need a higher forward speed to deflect an equivalent amount of air and thus generate an equivalent amount of lift. Large cargo aircraft tend to use longer wings with higher angles of attack, whereas supersonic aircraft tend to have short wings and rely heavily on high forward speed to generate lift.

However, this lift (deflection) process inevitably causes a retarding force called drag. Because lift and drag are both aerodynamic forces, the ratio of lift to drag is an indication of the aerodynamic efficiency of the airplane. The lift to drag ratio is the L/D ratio, pronounced "L over D ratio." An airplane has a high L/D ratio if it produces a large amount of lift or a small amount of drag. The lift/drag ratio is determined by dividing the lift coefficient by the drag coefficient, CL/CD. &lt;ref&gt;The Beginner's Guide to Aeronautics - NASA Glenn Research Center   https://www.grc.nasa.gov/www/k-12/airplane/ldrat.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The lift coefficient Cl is equal to the lift L divided by the (density r times half the velocity V squared times the wing area A). [Cl = L / (A * .5 * r * V^2)] The lift coefficient is also affected by the compressibility of the air, which is much greater at higher speeds, so velocity V is not a linear function. Compressibility is also affected by the shape of the aircraft surfaces.
&lt;ref&gt;The Beginner's Guide to Aeronautics - NASA Glenn Research Center   https://www.grc.nasa.gov/www/k-12/airplane/liftco.html &lt;/ref&gt;

The drag coefficient Cd is equal to the drag D divided by the (density r times half the velocity V squared times the reference area A). [Cd = D / (A * .5 * r * V^2)] 
&lt;ref&gt;The Beginner's Guide to Aeronautics - NASA Glenn Research Center   https://www.grc.nasa.gov/www/k-12/airplane/dragco.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Lift-to-drag ratios for practical aircraft vary from about 4:1 for vehicles and birds with relatively short wings, up to 60:1 or more for vehicles with very long wings, such as gliders. A greater angle of attack relative to the forward movement also increases the extent of deflection, and thus generates extra lift. However a greater angle of attack also generates extra drag. 

Lift/drag ratio also determines the glide ratio and gliding range. Since the glide ratio is based only on the relationship of the aerodynamics forces acting on the aircraft, aircraft weight will not affect it. The only effect weight has is to vary the time that the aircraft will glide for – a heavier aircraft gliding at a higher airspeed will arrive at the same touchdown point in a shorter time. &lt;ref&gt;The Beginner's Guide to Aeronautics - NASA Glenn Research Center   
https://www.grc.nasa.gov/www/k-12/airplane/ldrat.html&lt;/ref&gt;

====Buoyancy====
{{main article|Buoyancy}}
Air pressure acting up against an object in air is greater than the pressure above pushing down. The buoyancy, in both cases, is equal to the weight of fluid displaced - [[Archimedes' principle]] holds for air just as it does for water.

A cubic meter of air at ordinary [[atmospheric pressure]] and room temperature has a mass of about 1.2 kilograms, so its weight is about 12 newtons. Therefore, any 1-cubic-meter object in air is buoyed up with a force of 12 newtons. If the mass of the 1-cubic-meter object is greater than 1.2 kilograms (so that its weight is greater than 12 newtons), it falls to the ground when released. If an object of this size has a mass less than 1.2 kilograms, it rises in the air. Any object that has a mass that is less than the mass of an equal volume of air will rise in air - in other words, any object less dense than air will rise.

====Thrust to weight ratio====
{{main article|Thrust-to-weight ratio}}
'''Thrust-to-weight ratio''' is, as its name suggests, the ratio of instantaneous [[thrust]] to [[weight]] (where weight means weight at the [[Earth]]'s standard acceleration &lt;math&gt;g_0&lt;/math&gt;).&lt;ref name="sutton"&gt;Sutton and Biblarz 2000, p. 442. Quote: "thrust-to-weight ratio F/W&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is a dimensionless parameter that is identical to the acceleration of the rocket propulsion system (expressed in multiples of g0) if it could fly by itself in a gravity free vacuum."&lt;/ref&gt; It is a dimensionless parameter characteristic of [[rocket]]s and other jet engines and of vehicles propelled by such engines (typically space [[launch vehicle]]s and jet [[aircraft]]).

If the [[thrust-to-weight ratio]] is greater than the local gravity strength (expressed in ''g''s), then flight can occur without any forward motion or any aerodynamic lift being required.

If the thrust-to-weight ratio times the lift-to-drag ratio is greater than local gravity then [[takeoff]] using aerodynamic lift is possible.

===Flight dynamics===
[[File:Aptch.gif|thumb|[[Aircraft principal axes|Pitch]]]]
[[File:Ayaw.gif|thumb|[[Yaw (rotation)|Yaw]]]]
[[File:Aileron roll.gif|thumb|[[Aerobatic maneuver|Roll]]]]
[[File:dihedral.airliner.arp.750pix.jpg|thumb|The upward tilt of the wings and tailplane of an aircraft, as seen on this [[Boeing 737]], is called dihedral angle]]{{main article|Flight dynamics}}
'''Flight dynamics''' is the science of [[aircraft|air]] and [[spacecraft|space]] vehicle orientation and control in three dimensions. The three critical flight dynamics parameters are the angles of rotation in three [[dimensions]] about the vehicle's [[center of mass]], known as ''pitch'', ''roll'' and ''yaw'' (See [[Tait-Bryan rotations]] for an explanation).

The control of these dimensions can involve a [[horizontal stabilizer]] (i.e. "a tail"), [[ailerons]] and other movable aerodynamic devices which control angular stability i.e. flight attitude (which in turn affects [[altitude]], [[Aircraft heading|heading]]). Wings are often angled slightly upwards- they have "positive [[Dihedral (aircraft)|dihedral angle]]" which gives inherent roll stabilization.

===Energy efficiency===
{{main article|propulsive efficiency}}
To create thrust so as to be able to gain height, and to push through the air to overcome the drag associated with lift all takes energy. Different objects and creatures capable of flight vary in the efficiency of their muscles, motors and how well this translates into forward thrust.

Propulsive efficiency determines how much energy vehicles generate from a unit of fuel.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hq.nasa.gov/pao/History/SP-468/ch10-3.htm ch10-3 "History."] ''NASA.'' Retrieved: May 6, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Honicke et al. 1968 {{Page needed|date=May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Range===
{{main article|range (aircraft)}}
The range that powered flight articles can achieve is ultimately limited by their drag, as well as how much energy they can store on board and how efficiently they can turn that energy into propulsion.&lt;ref&gt;http://web.mit.edu/16.unified/www/FALL/thermodynamics/notes/node98.html&lt;/ref&gt;

For powered aircraft the useful energy is determined by their [[fuel fraction]]- what percentage of the takeoff weight is fuel, as well as the [[specific energy]] of the fuel used.

===Power-to-weight ratio===
{{main article|power-to-weight ratio}}
All animals and devices capable of sustained flight need relatively high power-to-weight ratios to be able to generate enough lift and/or thrust to achieve take off.

==Takeoff and landing==
{{main article|takeoff and landing}}
Vehicles that can fly can have different ways to '''takeoff and land'''. Conventional aircraft accelerate along the ground until sufficient lift is generated for [[takeoff]], and reverse the process for [[landing]]. Some aircraft can take off at low speed; this is called a short takeoff. Some aircraft such as helicopters and Harrier jump jets can take off and land vertically. Rockets also usually take off and land vertically, but some designs can land horizontally.

==Guidance, navigation and control==
{{main article|Guidance, navigation and control}}

===Navigation===
[[Navigation]] is the systems necessary to calculate current position (e.g. [[compass]], [[GPS]], [[LORAN]], [[star tracker]], [[inertial measurement unit]], and [[altimeter]]).

In aircraft, successful [[air navigation]] involves piloting an aircraft from place to place without getting lost, breaking the laws applying to aircraft, or endangering the safety of those on board or on the [[Earth|ground]].

The techniques used for navigation in the air will depend on whether the aircraft is flying under the [[visual flight rules]] (VFR) or the [[instrument flight rules]] (IFR). In the latter case, the [[aviator|pilot]] will navigate exclusively using [[flight instruments|instruments]] and [[radio navigation aid]]s such as beacons, or as directed under [[radar]] control by [[air traffic control]]. In the VFR case, a pilot will largely navigate using [[dead reckoning]] combined with visual observations (known as [[pilotage]]), with reference to appropriate maps. This may be supplemented using radio navigation aids.

===Guidance===
{{main article|Guidance system}}
A '''guidance system''' is a device or group of devices used in the [[navigation]] of a [[ship]], [[aircraft]], [[missile]], [[rocket]], [[satellite]], or other moving object. Typically, guidance is responsible for the calculation of the vector (i.e., direction, velocity) toward an objective.

===Control===

{{main article|Flight control system}}
A conventional fixed-wing '''aircraft flight control system''' consists of [[flight control surfaces]], the respective cockpit controls, connecting linkages, and the necessary operating mechanisms to control an aircraft's direction in flight. [[Aircraft engine controls]] are also considered as flight controls as they change speed.

====Traffic====
In the case of aircraft, air traffic is controlled by [[air traffic control]] systems.

[[Collision avoidance (spacecraft)|Collision avoidance]] is the process of controlling spacecraft to try to prevent collisions.

==Flight safety==
{{main article|aviation safety}}
'''Air safety''' is a term encompassing the theory, investigation and categorization of [[Aviation accidents and incidents|flight failures]], and the prevention of such failures through regulation, education and training. It can also be applied in the context of campaigns that inform the public as to the safety of [[air travel]].

'''Gasoline gallon equivalent''' ('''GGE''') or '''gasoline-equivalent gallon''' ('''GEG''') is the amount of alternative [[fuel]] it takes to equal the energy content of one liquid [[gallon]] of [[gasoline]]. GGE allows consumers to compare the energy content of competing fuels against a commonly known fuel—gasoline. GGE also compares gasoline to fuels sold as a gas (natural gas, propane, hydrogen) and electricity.

In 1994, the US [[National Institute of Standards and Technology]] (NIST) defined "gasoline gallon equivalent (GGE) means 5.660 pounds of natural gas."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor1-first= Tina |editor1-last= Butcher |editor2-first= Linda |editor2-last= Crown |editor3-first= Lynn |editor3-last= Sebring |editor4-first= Richard |editor4-last= Suiter |editor5-first= Juana |editor5-last= Williams |last-author-amp=yes |chapter-url= https://www.nist.gov/pml/wmd/pubs/upload/AppendD-08-HB44-FINAL.pdf |chapter-format= PDF |id= Handbook 44 |chapter= Appendix D: Definitions |title= Specifications, Tolerances, and Other Technical Requirements for Weighing and Measuring Devices, as Adopted by the 91st National Conference on Weights and Measures 2006 |url= https://www.nist.gov/pml/wmd/pubs/h44-07.cfm |location= Gaithersburg, MD |publisher= [[National Institute of Standards and Technology]] |year= 2006 |edition= 2007 |page= D-8 |accessdate= January 2, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Compressed natural gas]] (CNG), for example, is a gas rather than a liquid. It can be measured by its volume in standard cubic feet (ft³) (volume at atmospheric conditions), by its weight in pounds (lb) or by its energy content in joules (J) or British thermal units (BTU) or kilowatt-hours (kW·h). It is difficult to compare the cost of gasoline with other fuels if they are sold in different units. GGE solves this. One GGE of CNG and one GGE of electricity have exactly the same energy content as one gallon of gasoline. CNG sold at filling stations in the US is priced in dollars per GGE.

Using GGE to compare fuels for use in an [[Internal combustion engine#Energy efficiency|internal combustion engine]] is only the first part of the equation whose bottom line is useful [[Work (thermodynamics)|work]]. In the context of GGE, a real world kind of "useful work" is miles per gallon (MPG) as advertised by motor vehicle manufacturers.

Substituting one fuel for another in a given engine may start and may do useful work. However getting optimum efficiency from each fuel–engine combination requires adjusting the mix of air and fuel. This can be a manual adjustment using tools and test instruments or done automatically in computer-controlled fuel injected and multi-fuel vehicles. Fine tuning of the optimum fuel–air mix may be facilitated by using a [[supercharger]] or [[turbocharger]].

In battery or electric vehicles, calculating efficiency of useful work begins with the charge–discharge rate of the battery pack, generally 80% to 90%. Next is the conversion of potential energy (BTU) of the charge to distance traveled under power. See table below translating retail electricity costs for a GGE in BTU.

Note that throughout this article, 'gallon' refers to the US gallon of approximately 3.8 litres, as opposed to the imperial gallon of approximately 4.5 litres

==Compressed natural gas==
One GGE of natural gas is 126.67 cubic feet (3.587 m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;) at [[standard conditions]]. This volume of natural gas has the same energy content as one US gallon of gasoline (based on [[lower heating value]]s: 900 BTU/cu ft of natural gas and 115,000 BTU/gal of gasoline).&lt;ref name=DOEEERE&gt;{{cite web |agency= Alternative Fuels Data Center |date= October 29, 2014|url=http://www.eere.energy.gov/afdc/pdfs/fueltable.pdf |format= PDF  |title=Properties of Fuels |publisher= United States Department of Energy |work= Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy |accessdate= January 1, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One GGE of CNG pressurized at {{convert|2400|psi|MPa|abbr=on}} is 0.77 cubic foot (21.8 [[liter]]s or 5.75 Gallons). This volume of CNG at 2,400 psi has the same energy content as one US gallon of gasoline (based on lower heating values: 148,144 BTU/cu ft of CNG and 115,000 BTU/gal of gasoline.&lt;ref name=DOEEERE/&gt; Using [[Boyle's law]], the equivalent GGE at {{convert|3600|psi|MPa|abbr=on}} is 0.51 cubic foot (14.4 L or 3.82 actual US gal).

The National Conference of Weights &amp; Measurements (NCWM) has developed a standard unit of measurement for compressed natural gas, defined in the NIST Handbook 44 Appendix D as follows:
"1 Gasoline [US] gallon equivalent (GGE) means 2.567 kg (5.660 lb) of natural gas."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ts.nist.gov/WeightsAndMeasures/Publications/upload/13_IV_EngFuelReg04.doc#_Toc48655096 |format= DOC |title=Uniform Engine Fuels, Petroleum Products and Automotive Lubricants Regulation |publisher= National Institute of Standards and Technology |pages=149–164 |author= |date= |accessdate=October 8, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When consumers refuel their CNG vehicles in the USA, the CNG is usually measured and sold in GGE units. This is fairly helpful as a comparison to gallons of gasoline.

==Ethanol and fuels like E85==
1.5 gallons of ethanol has the same energy content as 1.0 gallon of gasoline.

The energy content of 1.0 US gallon of ethanol is 76,100 BTU, compared to 114,100 BTU for gasoline. (see chart above)

A [[flex-fuel vehicle]] will experience about 76% of the fuel mileage [[Miles per gallon|MPG]] when using [[E85]] (85% ethanol) products as compared to 100% gasoline. Simple calculations of the BTU values of the ethanol and the gasoline indicate the reduced heat values available to the internal combustion engine. Pure ethanol provides 2/3 of the heat value available in pure gasoline.

In the most common calculation, that is, the BTU value of pure gasoline vs gasoline with 10% ethanol, the latter has just over 96% BTU value of pure gasoline. Gasoline BTU varies relating to the [[Reid vapor pressure]] (causing easier vaporization in winter blends containing ethanol(ethanol is difficult to start a vehicle on when it is cold out) and anti-knock additives. Such additives offer a reduction in BTU value.

==Efficiency==
A concept closely related to the BTU or kWh potential of a given fuel is [[engine efficiency]], often called [[thermal efficiency]] in the case of internal combustion engines.

Generally speaking, an electrical motor is far more efficient than an internal combustion engine at converting [[potential energy]] into [[Work (thermodynamics)|work]] - turning the wheels that may move a car down the road, as there is minimal waste heat coming off the motor parts, and zero heat cast off by the coolant radiator and out of the exhaust.{{Citation needed|date=December 2012}}

A [[diesel cycle]] engine can be as much as 40% to 50% efficient at converting fuel into [[Work (physics)|work]], where a typical automotive gasoline engine's efficiency is about 25% to 30%.{{Citation needed|date=December 2012}}

The [[efficiency]] of converting a unit of fuel to rotation of the driving wheels includes many points of [[friction]] loss and heat loss through the exhaust or cooling system. Friction inside the engine happens along the cylinder walls, crankshaft rod bearings and main bearings, camshaft bearings, drive chains or gears, plus other miscellaneous and minor bearing surfaces. An electric motor has internal friction only at the main axle bearings. Friction outside the motor/engine includes loads from the generator / alternator, power steering pump, A/C compressor, transmission, transfer case (if four-wheel-drive), differential(s) and universal joints, plus rolling resistance of the pneumatic tires.

The [[Miles per gallon|MPG]] of a given vehicle starts with the thermal efficiency of the fuel and engine, less all of the above elements of friction.

==Miles per gallon of gasoline equivalent (MPGe)==

The MPGe metric was introduced in November 2010 by EPA in the [[Monroney label]] of the [[Nissan Leaf]] [[electric car]] and the [[Chevrolet Volt]] [[plug-in hybrid]].

{{infobox gold}}
'''Gold''' is a [[chemical element]] with symbol '''Au''' (from {{lang-la|aurum}}) and [[atomic number]] 79, making it one of the higher [[atomic number]] elements that occur naturally. In its purest form, it is a [[brightness|bright]], slightly reddish yellow, dense, soft, [[malleable]], and [[ductile]] [[metal]]. Chemically, gold is a [[transition metal]] and a [[group 11 element]]. It is one of the least reactive chemical elements and is solid under [[Standard conditions for temperature and pressure|standard conditions]]. Gold often occurs in free elemental (native) form, as [[gold nugget|nuggets]] or grains, in [[rock (geology)|rocks]], in [[vein (geology)|veins]], and in [[alluvial deposit]]s. It occurs in a [[solid solution]] series with the native element [[silver]] (as [[electrum]]) and also naturally [[alloy]]ed with [[copper]] and [[palladium]]. Less commonly, it occurs in minerals as gold compounds, often with [[tellurium]] ([[gold telluride]]s).

Gold is resistant to most [[acid]]s, though it does dissolve in [[aqua regia]], a mixture of [[nitric acid]] and [[hydrochloric acid]], which forms a soluble [[chloroauric acid|tetrachloroaurate]] [[anion]]. Gold is insoluble in [[nitric acid]], which dissolves silver and [[base metal]]s, a property that has long been used to [[refining (metallurgy)|refine]] gold and to confirm the presence of gold in metallic objects, giving rise to the term ''[[acid test (gold)|acid test]]''. Gold also dissolves in [[alkaline]] solutions of [[cyanide]], which are used in [[gold cyanidation|mining]] and [[electroplating]]. Gold dissolves in [[mercury (element)|mercury]], forming [[amalgam (chemistry)|amalgam]] alloys, but this is not a [[chemical reaction]].

A relatively rare element,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|publisher=Routledge|author=Mark Duckenfield|date=2016|title=The Monetary History of Gold: A Documentary History, 1660-1999|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VeJmDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA4|page=4|quote=Its scarcity makes it a useful store of value; however, its relative rarity reduced its utility as a currency, especially for transactions in small denominations.|isbn=9781315476124}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|publisher=Smithsonian Books|author=Susan M.

Rarity is, nevertheless, in itself a source of value, and so is the degree of difficulty which surrounds the winning of the raw material, especially if it is exotic and has to be brought some distance. Gold is, geologically, a relatively rare material on earth and occurs only in specific places which are remote from most other places.|isbn=9781588345172}}&lt;/ref&gt; gold is a [[precious metal]] that has been used for [[coin]]age, [[jewelry]], and other [[work of art|arts]] throughout [[recorded history]]. In the past, a [[gold standard]] was often implemented as a [[monetary policy]], but gold coins ceased to be minted as a circulating currency in the 1930s, and the world gold standard was abandoned for a [[fiat currency]] system after [[Nixon shock|1971]].

A total of 186,700 [[tonne]]s of gold exists above ground, {{as of|2015|lc=y}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.gold.org/supply-and-demand/supply|title = Supply|accessdate = 26 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The world consumption of new gold produced is about 50% in jewelry, 40% in [[investment]]s, and 10% in [[industry]].&lt;ref name='oil-price.com-worlds-gold-consumption 2011'&gt;{{cite news |first=Andy |last=Soos |title=Gold Mining Boom Increasing Mercury Pollution Risk |date=6 January 2011 |publisher=Oilprice.com |url=http://oilprice.com/Metals/Gold/Gold-Mining-Boom-Increasing-Mercury-Pollution-Risk.html |work=Advanced Media Solutions, Inc. |accessdate=26 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gold's high malleability, ductility, resistance to corrosion and most other chemical reactions, and conductivity of electricity have led to its continued use in corrosion resistant [[electrical connector]]s in all types of computerized devices (its chief industrial use). Gold is also used in [[infrared]] shielding, [[colored glass|colored-glass]] production, [[gold leaf]]ing, and [[restorative dentistry|tooth restoration]]. Certain [[gold salts]] are still used as [[anti-inflammatories]] in medicine. {{as of|2016}}, the [[List of countries by gold production|world's largest]] gold producer by far was [[Gold mining in China|China]] with 450 tonnes per year.&lt;ref name="china2014" /&gt;

Gold is the most [[malleable]] of all metals; a single gram can be beaten into a sheet of 1 square meter, and an [[avoirdupois ounce]] into 300 square feet. Gold leaf can be beaten thin enough to become semi-transparent.

=== Color ===
{{Main|Colored gold}}
[[File:Ag-Au-Cu-colours-english.svg|thumb|left|Different colors of [[Silver|Ag]]–Au–[[Copper|Cu]] alloys]]
Whereas most metals are gray or silvery white, gold is slightly reddish-yellow.&lt;ref name="chem"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=o-FYAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA70&amp;lpg=PA70&amp;dq=Pure+gold+is+slightly+reddish+yellow#v=onepage&amp;q=Pure%20gold%20is%20slightly%20reddish%20yellow Encyclopedia of Chemistry, Theoretical, Practical, and Analytical: As Applied to the Arts and Manufactures], J.P. Lippincott &amp; Sons (1880)&lt;/ref&gt; This color is determined by the frequency of [[plasma oscillation]]s among the metal's valence electrons, in the ultraviolet range for most metals but in the visible range for gold due to [[relativistic quantum chemistry|relativistic effects]] affecting the [[atomic orbital|orbitals]] around gold atoms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/physics/Relativity/SR/gold_color.html|title=Relativity in Chemistry|publisher=Math.ucr.edu|accessdate=5 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal  |first=Hubert |last=Schmidbaur |first2=Stephanie |last2=Cronje |first3=Bratislav |last3=Djordjevic |first4=Oliver |last4=Schuster |journal=Chemical Physics |volume=311 |pages=151–161 |title=Understanding gold chemistry through relativity |doi=10.1016/j.chemphys.2004.09.023 |date=2005 |issue=1–2 |bibcode=2005CP....311..151S }}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar effects impart a golden hue to metallic [[caesium]].

Common colored gold alloys include the distinctive eighteen-karat [[rose gold]] created by the addition of copper. Alloys containing palladium or nickel are also important in commercial jewelry as these produce white gold alloys. Fourteen-karat gold-copper alloy is nearly identical in color to certain [[bronze]] alloys, and both may be used to produce police and other [[badge]]s. White gold alloys can be made with [[palladium]] or [[nickel]]. Fourteen- and eighteen-karat gold alloys with silver alone appear greenish-yellow and are referred to as [[green gold]]. Blue gold can be made by alloying with [[iron]], and purple gold can be made by alloying with [[aluminium]]. Less commonly, addition of [[manganese]], [[aluminium]], [[indium]] and other elements can produce more unusual colors of gold for various applications.&lt;ref name="utilisegold" /&gt;

[[Colloidal gold]], used by electron-microscopists, is red if the particles are small; larger particles of colloidal gold are blue.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=MzT9eWxtmRgC&amp;pg=PA180&amp;dq=%C2%A0Colloidal+gold,+used+by+electron-microscopists,+is+red+if+the+particles+are+small#v=onepage&amp;q=%C2%A0Colloidal%20gold,%20used%20by%20electron-microscopists,%20is%20red%20if%20the%20particles%20are%20small|title=Electron Microscopy in Microbiology|date=1 October 1988|publisher=Academic Press|isbn=978-0-08-086049-7|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Isotopes ===
{{Main|Isotopes of gold}}
Gold has only one stable [[isotope]], {{chem|197|Au}}, which is also its only naturally occurring isotope, so gold is both a [[Mononuclidic element|mononuclidic]] and [[monoisotopic element]]. Thirty-six [[radioisotopes]] have been synthesized, ranging in [[atomic mass]] from 169 to 205. The most stable of these is {{chem|195|Au}} with a [[half-life]] of 186.1 days. The least stable is {{chem|171|Au}}, which decays by [[proton emission]] with a half-life of 30 µs. Most of gold's radioisotopes with atomic masses below 197 decay by some combination of [[proton emission]], [[alpha decay|α decay]], and [[Beta decay#β+ decay|β&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; decay]]. The exceptions are {{chem|195|Au}}, which decays by electron capture, and {{chem|196|Au}}, which decays most often by electron capture (93%) with a minor [[Beta decay#β− decay|β&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; decay]] path (7%).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.nndc.bnl.gov/nudat2/ | website = National Nuclear Data Center | title = Nudat 2|accessdate=12 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; All of gold's radioisotopes with atomic masses above 197 decay by β&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; decay.&lt;ref name="nubase"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Audi |first=G. |title=The NUBASE Evaluation of Nuclear and Decay Properties |journal=Nuclear Physics A |volume=729 |issue=1 |pages=3–128 |date=2003 |doi=10.1016/j.nuclphysa.2003.11.001 |bibcode=2003NuPhA.729....3A |last2=Bersillon |first2=O. |last3=Blachot |first3=J. |last4=Wapstra |first4=A. H.|url=http://hal.in2p3.fr/in2p3-00014184 |citeseerx=10.1.1.692.8504 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

At least 32 [[nuclear isomer]]s have also been characterized, ranging in atomic mass from 170 to 200. Within that range, only {{chem|178|Au}}, {{chem|180|Au}}, {{chem|181|Au}}, {{chem|182|Au}}, and {{chem|188|Au}} do not have isomers. Gold's most stable isomer is {{chem|198m2|Au}} with a half-life of 2.27 days. Gold's least stable isomer is {{chem|177m2|Au}} with a half-life of only 7&amp;nbsp;ns. {{chem|184m1|Au}} has three decay paths: β&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; decay, [[isomeric transition]], and alpha decay. No other isomer or isotope of gold has three decay paths.&lt;ref name="nubase" /&gt;

==== Synthesis ====
The production of gold from a more common element, such as [[lead]], has long been a subject of human inquiry, and the ancient and medieval discipline of [[alchemy]] often focused on it; however, the transmutation of the chemical elements did not become possible until the understanding of nuclear physics in the 20th century. The first synthesis of gold was conducted by Japanese physicist [[Hantaro Nagaoka]], who synthesized gold from [[mercury (element)|mercury]] in 1924 by neutron bombardment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Miethe |first1=A. |title=Der Zerfall des Quecksilberatoms |doi=10.1007/BF01505547 |journal=Die Naturwissenschaften |volume=12 |issue=29 |pages=597–598 |year=1924 |pmid= |pmc= |bibcode=1924NW.....12..597M }}&lt;/ref&gt; An American team, working without knowledge of Nagaoka's prior study, conducted the same experiment in 1941, achieving the same result and showing that the [[isotopes of gold]] produced by it were all [[radioactive]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Sherr |first=R. |first2=K. T. |last2=Bainbridge |first3=H. H. |last3=Anderson |last-author-amp=yes |title=Transmutation of Mercury by Fast Neutrons |date=1941 |journal=[[Physical Review]] |volume=60 |issue=7 |pages=473–479 |doi=10.1103/PhysRev.60.473 |bibcode=1941PhRv...60..473S }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gold can currently be manufactured in a nuclear reactor by [[irradiation]] either of [[platinum]] or mercury.

Only the mercury isotope &lt;sup&gt;196&lt;/sup&gt;Hg, which occurs with a frequency of 0.15% in natural mercury, can be converted to gold by [[neutron capture]], and following [[electron capture]]-decay into &lt;sup&gt;197&lt;/sup&gt;Au with [[slow neutron]]s. Other mercury isotopes are converted when irradiated with slow neutrons into one another, or formed mercury isotopes which [[beta decay]] into [[thallium]].

Using [[fast neutron]]s, the mercury isotope &lt;sup&gt;198&lt;/sup&gt;Hg, which composes 9.97% of natural mercury, can be converted by splitting off a neutron and becoming &lt;sup&gt;197&lt;/sup&gt;Hg, which then disintegrates to stable gold. This reaction, however, possesses a smaller activation cross-section and is feasible only with un-moderated reactors.

It is also possible to eject several neutrons with very high energy into the other mercury isotopes in order to form &lt;sup&gt;197&lt;/sup&gt;Hg. However, such high-energy neutrons can be produced only by [[particle accelerator]]s.{{Clarify|reason=eject from what substance, and why can't this be done with a nuclear reactor?|date=March 2011}}

== Chemistry ==
[[File:Gold(III) chloride solution.jpg|thumb|right|Gold(III) chloride solution in water]]
Although gold is the most noble of the [[noble metal]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/376238a0 |title=Why gold is the noblest of all the metals |date=1995 |last1=Hammer |first1=B. |last2=Norskov |first2=J. K. |journal=Nature |volume=376 |issue=6537 |pages=238–240 |bibcode=1995Natur.376..238H }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1103/PhysRevB.6.4370 |title=Optical Constants of the Noble Metals |date=1972 |last1=Johnson |first1=P. B. |last2=Christy |first2=R. W. |journal=Physical Review B |volume=6 |issue=12 |pages=4370–4379 |bibcode=1972PhRvB...6.4370J }}&lt;/ref&gt; it still forms many diverse compounds. The [[oxidation state]] of gold in its compounds ranges from −1 to +5, but Au(I) and Au(III) dominate its chemistry. Au(I), referred to as the aurous ion, is the most common oxidation state with soft [[ligand]]s such as [[thioether]]s, [[thiolate]]s, and tertiary [[phosphine]]s. Au(I) compounds are typically linear. A good example is [[gold cyanidation|Au(CN)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;]], which is the soluble form of gold encountered in mining. The binary [[gold halide]]s, such as [[gold(I) chloride|AuCl]], form zigzag polymeric chains, again featuring linear coordination at Au. Most drugs based on gold are Au(I) derivatives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Shaw III|first=C. F.|title=Gold-Based Medicinal Agents|journal=Chemical Reviews|date=1999|volume=99|issue=9|pages=2589–2600|doi=10.1021/cr980431o|pmid=11749494}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Au(III) (auric) is a common oxidation state, and is illustrated by [[gold(III) chloride]], Au&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Cl&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;. The gold atom centers in Au(III) complexes, like other d&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt; compounds, are typically [[square planar]], with [[chemical bond]]s that have both [[covalent]] and [[ion]]ic character.

Gold does not react with oxygen at any temperature&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://chemwiki.ucdavis.edu/Core/Inorganic_Chemistry/Descriptive_Chemistry/Elements_Organized_by_Block/2_p-Block_Elements/Group_16%253A_The_Oxygen_Family/Chemistry_of_Oxygen|title=Chemistry of Oxygen|website=Chemwiki [[UC Davis]]|language=en-US|access-date=1 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and, up to 100&amp;nbsp;°C, is resistant to attack from ozone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor-last1=Craig |editor-first1=B.

Some free [[halogen]]s react with gold.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Wiberg |first=Egon |last2=Wiberg |first2=Nils |last3=Holleman |first3=Arnold Frederick |last-author-amp=yes |date=2001 |title=Inorganic Chemistry |edition=101st |publisher=Academic Press |isbn=978-0-12-352651-9 |page=1286 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gold is strongly attacked by fluorine at dull-red heat&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Mtth5g59dEIC |title=Inorganic Chemistry |last=Wiberg |first=Egon |last2=Wiberg |first2=Nils |date=1 January 2001 |publisher=Academic Press |isbn=978-0-12-352651-9 |page=404 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; to form [[gold(III) fluoride]]. Powdered gold reacts with chlorine at 180&amp;nbsp;°C to form [[gold(III) chloride|AuCl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wiberg|Wiberg|Holleman|2001|pp=1286–1287}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gold reacts with bromine at 140&amp;nbsp;°C to form [[gold(III) bromide]], but reacts only very slowly with iodine to form [[gold(I) iodide|the monoiodide]].

Gold does not react with sulfur directly,&lt;ref name="library.lanl.gov"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://library.lanl.gov/cgi-bin/getfile?rc000062.pdf|title=Wayback Machine|date=10 November 2004|publisher=|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20041110193206/http://library.lanl.gov/cgi-bin/getfile?rc000062.pdf|archivedate=10 November 2004|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; but [[gold(III) sulfide]] can be made by passing [[hydrogen sulfide]] through a dilute solution of gold(III) chloride or [[chlorauric acid]].

Gold readily dissolves in [[mercury (element)|mercury]] at room temperature to form an [[amalgam (chemistry)|amalgam]], and forms [[alloy]]s with many other metals at higher temperatures. These alloys can be produced to modify the hardness and other metallurgical properties, to control [[melting point]] or to create exotic colors.&lt;ref name="utilisegold" /&gt;

Gold is unaffected by most acids. It does not react with [[hydrofluoric acid|hydrofluoric]], [[hydrochloric acid|hydrochloric]], [[hydrobromic acid|hydrobromic]], [[hydriodic acid|hydriodic]], [[sulfuric acid|sulfuric]], or [[nitric acid]]. It does react with [[selenic acid]], and is dissolved by [[aqua regia]], a 1:3 mixture of [[nitric acid]] and [[hydrochloric acid]]. Nitric acid oxidizes the metal to +3 ions, but only in minute amounts, typically undetectable in the pure acid because of the chemical equilibrium of the reaction. However, the ions are removed from the equilibrium by hydrochloric acid, forming AuCl&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; ions, or [[chloroauric acid]], thereby enabling further oxidation.

Gold is similarly unaffected by most bases. It does not react with [[aqueous solution|aqueous]], [[solid]], or [[molten]] [[sodium hydroxide|sodium]] or [[potassium hydroxide]]. It does however, react with [[sodium cyanide|sodium]] or [[potassium cyanide]] under alkaline conditions when [[oxygen]] is present to form soluble complexes.&lt;ref name="library.lanl.gov" /&gt;

Common [[oxidation state]]s of gold include +1 (gold(I) or aurous compounds) and +3 (gold(III) or auric compounds). Gold ions in solution are readily [[reduction (chemistry)|reduced]] and [[precipitation (chemistry)|precipitated]] as metal by adding any other metal as the [[reducing agent]]. The added metal is [[oxidation|oxidized]] and dissolves, allowing the gold to be displaced from solution and be recovered as a solid precipitate.

=== Rare oxidation states ===

Some gold compounds exhibit ''[[aurophilicity|aurophilic bonding]]'', which describes the tendency of gold ions to interact at distances that are too long to be a conventional Au–Au bond but shorter than [[Van der Waals force|van der Waals bonding]]. The interaction is estimated to be comparable in strength to that of a [[hydrogen bond]].

Well-defined cluster compounds are numerous.&lt;ref name=Holleman /&gt; In such cases, gold has a fractional oxidation state. A representative example is the octahedral species {Au([[Triphenylphosphine|P(C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]])}&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;.

Struik Publishers, Cape Town.&lt;/ref&gt; These gold-bearing rocks had furthermore been covered by a thick layer of Ventersdorp lavas and the [[Transvaal Basin|Transvaal Supergroup]] of rocks before the meteor struck. What the Vredefort impact achieved, however, was to distort the [[Witwatersrand basin]] in such a way that the gold-bearing rocks were brought to the present [[erosion surface]] in [[Johannesburg]], on the [[Witwatersrand]], just inside the rim of the original 300&amp;nbsp;km diameter crater caused by the meteor strike. The discovery of the deposit in 1886 launched the [[Witwatersrand Gold Rush]]. Some 22% of all the gold that is ascertained to exist today on Earth has been extracted from these Witwatersrand rocks.&lt;ref name=Norman /&gt;

== Occurrence ==
On Earth, gold is found in [[ore]]s in rock formed from the Precambrian time onward.&lt;ref name="La Niece"/&gt; It most often occurs as a [[native metal]], typically in a metal [[solid solution]] with silver (i.e. as a gold silver [[alloy]]). Such alloys usually have a silver content of 8–10%. [[Electrum]] is elemental gold with more than 20% silver. Electrum's color runs from golden-silvery to silvery, dependent upon the silver content. The more silver, the lower the [[specific gravity]].

Native gold occurs as very small to microscopic particles embedded in rock, often together with [[quartz]] or [[sulfide mineral]]s such as "Fool's Gold", which is a [[pyrite]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://arizonagoldprospectors.com/formation.htm |title=Formation of Lode Gold Deposits |publisher=arizonagoldprospectors.com |author=Heike, Brian |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130122100747/http://arizonagoldprospectors.com/formation.htm |archivedate=22 January 2013 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; These are called [[lode]] deposits. The metal in a native state is also found in the form of free flakes, grains or larger [[Gold nugget|nuggets]]&lt;ref name="La Niece"/&gt; that have been eroded from rocks and end up in [[alluvial]] deposits called [[placer deposit]]s. Such free gold is always richer at the surface of gold-bearing veins{{clarify| reason = Richer than where? Than deeper in the veins? Than in some other place on the surface?|date=May 2012}} owing to the [[oxidation]] of accompanying minerals followed by weathering, and washing of the dust into streams and rivers, where it collects and can be welded by water action to form nuggets.

Gold sometimes occurs combined with [[tellurium]] as the [[mineral]]s [[calaverite]], [[krennerite]], [[nagyagite]], [[petzite]] and [[sylvanite]] (see [[telluride mineral]]s), and as the rare bismuthide [[maldonite]] (Au&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Bi) and antimonide [[aurostibite]] (AuSb&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;). Gold also occurs in rare alloys with [[copper]], [[lead]], and [[mercury (element)|mercury]]: the minerals [[auricupride]] (Cu&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Au), [[novodneprite]] (AuPb&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) and [[weishanite]] ((Au, Ag)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Hg&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;).

Recent research suggests that microbes can sometimes play an important role in forming gold deposits, transporting and precipitating gold to form grains and nuggets that collect in alluvial deposits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/science/news/enviro/EnviroRepublish_1032376.htm|title=Environment &amp; Nature News&amp;nbsp;– Bugs grow gold that looks like coral&amp;nbsp;– 28 January 2004|accessdate=22 July 2006}} This is doctoral research undertaken by Frank Reith at the Australian National University, published 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another recent study has claimed water in faults vaporizes during an earthquake, depositing gold. When an earthquake strikes, it moves along a [[fault (geology)|fault]]. Water often lubricates faults, filling in fractures and jogs. About 6 miles (10 kilometers) below the surface, under incredible temperatures and pressures, the water carries high concentrations of carbon dioxide, silica, and gold. During an earthquake, the fault jog suddenly opens wider. The water inside the void instantly vaporizes, flashing to steam and forcing silica, which forms the mineral quartz, and gold out of the fluids and onto nearby surfaces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.yahoo.com/earthquakes-turn-water-gold-180356174.html|title=Earthquakes Turn Water into Gold&amp;#124;18 March 2013|accessdate=18 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Seawater ===
The world's [[ocean]]s contain gold. Measured concentrations of gold in the Atlantic and Northeast Pacific are 50–150 [[femtomolar|femtomol]]/L or 10–30 parts per [[quadrillion]] (about 10–30&amp;nbsp;g/km&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;). In general, gold concentrations for south Atlantic and central Pacific samples are the same (~50 femtomol/L) but less certain. Mediterranean deep waters contain slightly higher concentrations of gold (100–150 femtomol/L) attributed to wind-blown dust and/or rivers. At 10 parts per quadrillion the Earth's [[oceans]] would hold 15,000 tonnes of gold.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |doi=10.1016/0012-821X(90)90060-B |title=Gold in seawater |first=K. |last=Kenison Falkner |journal=Earth and Planetary Science Letters |volume=98 |date=1990 |pages=208–221 |last2=Edmond |first2=J. |issue=2 |bibcode=1990E&amp;PSL..98..208K}}&lt;/ref&gt; These figures are three orders of magnitude less than reported in the literature prior to 1988, indicating contamination problems with the earlier data.

A number of people have claimed to be able to economically recover gold from [[sea water]], but they were either mistaken or acted in an intentional deception. Prescott Jernegan ran a gold-from-seawater swindle in the [[United States]] in the 1890s, as did an English fraudster in the early 1900s.&lt;ref&gt;Plazak, Dan ''A Hole in the Ground with a Liar at the Top'' (Salt Lake: Univ. of Utah Press, 2006) {{ISBN|0-87480-840-5}} (contains a chapter on gold-from seawater swindles)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Fritz Haber]] did research on the extraction of gold from sea water in an effort to help pay [[Germany]]'s reparations following [[World War I]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |title=Das Gold im Meerwasser |first=F. |last=Haber |volume=40 |issue=11 |date=1927 |doi=10.1002/ange.19270401103 |pages=303–314 |journal=Zeitschrift für Angewandte Chemie}}&lt;/ref&gt; Based on the published values of 2 to 64 ppb of gold in seawater a commercially successful extraction seemed possible.

Large mines were also present across the [[Red Sea]] in what is now [[Saudi Arabia]].

Gold is mentioned frequently in the [[Old Testament]], starting with [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] 2:11 (at [[Havilah]]), the story of [[The Golden Calf]] and many parts of the temple including the [[Menorah (Temple)|Menorah]] and the golden altar. In the [[New Testament]], it is included with the gifts of the [[magi]] in the first chapters of Matthew. The [[Book of Revelation]] 21:21 describes the city of [[New Jerusalem]] as having streets "made of pure gold, clear as crystal". Exploitation of gold in the south-east corner of the [[Black Sea]] is said to date from the time of [[Midas]], and this gold was important in the establishment of what is probably the world's earliest coinage in [[Lydia]] around 610 BC.&lt;ref name=lion /&gt; The legend of the [[golden fleece]] dating from eighth century BCE may refer to the use of fleeces to trap gold dust from [[placer deposit]]s in the ancient world. From the 6th or 5th century BC, the [[Chu (state)]] circulated the [[Ying Yuan]], one kind of square gold coin.

In [[Roman metallurgy]], new methods for extracting gold on a large scale were developed by introducing [[hydraulic mining]] methods, especially in [[Hispania]] from 25 BC onwards and in [[Dacia]] from 106 AD onwards. One of their largest mines was at [[Las Medulas]] in [[León (province)|León]], where seven long [[aqueduct (watercourse)|aqueducts]] enabled them to sluice most of a large alluvial deposit. The mines at [[Roşia Montană]] in [[Transylvania]] were also very large, and until very recently, still mined by opencast methods. They also exploited smaller deposits in [[Roman Britain|Britain]], such as placer and hard-rock deposits at [[Dolaucothi]]. The various methods they used are well described by [[Pliny the Elder]] in his [[encyclopedia]] ''[[Naturalis Historia]]'' written towards the end of the first century AD.

During [[Mansa Musa]]'s (ruler of the [[Mali Empire]] from 1312 to 1337) [[hajj]] to [[Mecca]] in 1324, he passed through [[Cairo]] in July 1324, and was reportedly accompanied by a [[camel train]] that included thousands of people and nearly a hundred camels where he gave away so much gold that it depressed the price in Egypt for over a decade, causing high [[inflation]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20060524015912/http://www.blackhistorypages.net/pages/mansamusa.php Mansa Musa]. Black History Pages&lt;/ref&gt; A contemporary Arab historian remarked:

{{quote|Gold was at a high price in Egypt until they came in that year. The mithqal did not go below 25 dirhams and was generally above, but from that time its value fell and it cheapened in price and has remained cheap till now. The mithqal does not exceed 22 dirhams or less. This has been the state of affairs for about twelve years until this day by reason of the large amount of gold which they brought into Egypt and spent there [...].|sign=[[Chihab Al-Umari]]|source=Kingdom of Mali&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Kingdom of Mali&amp;nbsp;– Primary Source Documents|url=http://www.bu.edu/africa/outreach/resources/k_o_mali/|website=African studies Center|publisher=[[Boston University]]|accessdate=30 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The European exploration of the Americas was fueled in no small part by reports of the gold ornaments displayed in great profusion by [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] peoples, especially in [[Mesoamerica]], [[Peru]], [[Ecuador]] and [[Colombia]]. The [[Aztec]]s regarded gold as the product of the gods, calling it literally "god excrement" (''teocuitlatl'' in [[Nahuatl]]), and after [[Moctezuma II]] was killed, most of this gold was shipped to Spain.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |first=Frances |last=Berdan, |first2=Patricia Rieff |last2=Anawalt |title=The Codex Mendoza |volume=2 |page=151 |publisher=[[University of California Press]] |date=1992 |isbn=978-0-520-06234-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, for the [[indigenous peoples of North America]] gold was considered useless and they saw much greater value in other [[minerals]] which were directly related to their utility, such as [[obsidian]], [[flint]], and [[slate]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20120112010110/http://www.sierranevadavirtualmuseum.com/docs/galleries/history/culture/shadows.htm Sierra Nevada Virtual Museum]. Sierra Nevada Virtual Museum. Retrieved on 4 May 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Rumors of cities filled with gold fueled legends of [[El Dorado]].

Gold played a role in western culture, as a cause for desire and of corruption, as told in children's [[fable]]s such as [[Rumpelstiltskin]]—where Rumpelstiltskin turns hay into gold for the peasant's daughter in return for her child when she becomes a princess—and the stealing of the hen that lays golden eggs in [[Jack and the Beanstalk]].

The top prize at the [[Olympic Games]] and many other sports competitions is the [[gold medal]].

75% of the presently accounted for gold has been extracted since 1910. It has been estimated that the currently known amount of gold internationally would form a single cube 20&amp;nbsp;m (66&amp;nbsp;ft) on a side (equivalent to 8,000&amp;nbsp;m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;).&lt;ref name="goldsheetlinks"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.goldsheetlinks.com/production2.htm|title=Yearly Gold Production in metric tonnes (1900–2004)|website=Goldsheet Mining Directory|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060612223615/http://goldsheetlinks.com/production2.htm|archivedate=12 June 2006|accessdate=22 July 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One main goal of the [[alchemy|alchemists]] was to produce gold from other substances, such as [[lead]]&amp;nbsp;— presumably by the interaction with a mythical substance called the [[philosopher's stone]]. Although they never succeeded in this attempt, the alchemists did promote an interest in systematically finding out what can be done with substances, and this laid the foundation for today's [[chemistry]]. Their symbol for gold was the [[circled dot|circle with a point at its center]] (☉), which was also the [[astrology|astrological]] symbol and the ancient [[Chinese character]] for the [[Sun]].

Golden treasures have been rumored to be found at various locations, following tragedies such as the Jewish temple treasures in the Vatican, following the temple's destruction in 70 AD, a gold stash on the ''[[Titanic]]'', the [[Nazi gold]] train – following [[World War II]].

The [[Dome of the Rock]] is covered with an ultra-thin golden glassier. The [[Sikh]] Golden temple, the [[Harmandir Sahib]], is a building covered with gold. Similarly the [[Wat Phra Kaew]] emerald [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] [[temple]] ([[wat]]) in [[Thailand]] has ornamental gold-leafed statues and roofs. Some European king and queen's [[crown (headgear)|crowns]] were made of gold, and gold was used for the [[bridal crown]] since antiquity. An ancient Talmudic text circa 100 AD describes [[Rachel, wife of Rabbi Akiva]], receiving a "Jerusalem of Gold" (diadem). A Greek burial crown made of gold was found in a grave circa 370 BC.

=== Etymology ===
[[File:Beowulf - gold.jpg|thumb|An early mention of gold in the ''[[Beowulf]]'']]
"Gold" is [[cognate]] with similar words in many [[Germanic languages]], deriving via [[Proto-Germanic]] [[wikt:Appendix:Proto-Germanic/gulþą|*''gulþą'']] from [[Proto-Indo-European]] [[wikt:Appendix:Proto-Indo-European/ǵʰelh₃-|*''ǵʰelh₃-'']] ("to shine, to gleam; to be yellow or green").&lt;ref&gt;Oxford English Dictionary&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hesse, R W. (2007) [https://books.google.com/books?id=DIWEi5Hg93gC&amp;pg=PA103 Jewelrymaking Through History: An Encyclopedia], Greenwood Publishing Group. {{ISBN|0313335079}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The symbol ''Au'' is from the {{lang-la|[[:wikt:aurum|aurum]]}}, the Latin word for "gold".&lt;ref&gt;Notre Dame University [http://www.archives.nd.edu/cgi-bin/lookup.pl?stem=Aurum&amp;ending= Latin Dictionary] Retrieved 7 June 2012&lt;/ref&gt; The Proto-Indo-European ancestor of ''aurum'' was ''*h₂é-h₂us-o-'', meaning "glow". This word is derived from the same [[Root (linguistics)|root]] (Proto-Indo-European ''*h₂u̯es-'' "to dawn") as [[wikt:Appendix:Proto-Indo-European/h₂éwsōs|''*h₂éu̯sōs'']], the ancestor of the Latin word [[Aurora]], "dawn".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=de Vaan |first=Michel |title=Etymological Dictionary of Latin and the other Italic languages |date=2008 |publisher=Brill |location=Leiden: Boston |isbn=978 90 04 16797 1 |page=63}}&lt;/ref&gt; This etymological relationship is presumably behind the frequent claim in scientific publications that ''aurum'' meant "shining dawn".&lt;ref name=Brathwaite&gt;Christie, A and Brathwaite, R.

=== Culture ===
{{refimprove section|small=yes|date=February 2014}}
Outside chemistry, gold is mentioned in a variety of expressions, most often associated with intrinsic worth.&lt;ref name="martin08"/&gt; Great human achievements are frequently rewarded with gold, in the form of [[gold medal]]s, gold [[trophy|trophies]] and other decorations. Winners of athletic events and other graded competitions are usually awarded a gold medal. Many awards such as the [[Nobel Prize]] are made from gold as well. Other award statues and prizes are depicted in gold or are [[gold plated]] (such as the [[Academy Awards]], the [[Golden Globe Awards]], the [[Emmy Awards]], the [[Palme d'Or]], and the [[British Academy Film Awards]]).

[[Aristotle]] in his [[Aristotelian ethics|ethics]] used gold symbolism when referring to what is now known as the [[golden mean (philosophy)|golden mean]]. Similarly, gold is associated with perfect or divine principles, such as in the case of the [[golden ratio]] and the [[golden rule]].

Gold is further associated with the wisdom of aging and fruition. The fiftieth [[wedding anniversary]] is golden. A person's most valued or most successful latter years are sometimes considered "golden years". The height of a civilization is referred to as a [[golden age]].

In some forms of [[Christianity]] and [[Judaism]], gold has been associated both with [[sacred|holiness]] and [[evil]]. In the [[Book of Exodus]], the [[Golden Calf]] is a symbol of [[idolatry]], while in the [[Book of Genesis]], [[Abraham]] was said to be rich in gold and [[silver]], and Moses was instructed to cover the [[Mercy Seat]] of [[Ark of the Covenant|the Ark of the Covenant]] with pure gold. In [[Eastern Christianity|Byzantine]] [[icon]]ography the [[Halo (religious iconography)|halos]] of [[Christ]], [[Virgin Mary|Mary]] and the Christian [[saints]] are often golden.

According to [[Christopher Columbus]], those who had something of gold were in possession of something of great value on Earth and a substance to even help souls to paradise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Bernstein |first=Peter L. |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dIYmHiYhDu8C&amp;printsec=frontcover |title=The Power of Gold: The History of an Obsession |date=2004 |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons |isbn=978-0-471-43659-1 |page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Wedding ring]]s have been made of gold.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=XQA0AQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA418&amp;dq=%C2%A0Wedding+rings+have+been+made+of+gold#v=onepage&amp;q=%C2%A0Wedding%20rings%20have%20been%20made%20of%20gold|title=The Canadian Monthly and National Review|date=1874|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is long lasting and unaffected by the passage of time and may aid in the ring symbolism of eternal vows before God and the perfection the marriage signifies. In [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox Christian]] wedding ceremonies, the wedded couple is adorned with a golden crown (though some opt for wreaths, instead) during the ceremony, an amalgamation of symbolic rites.

[[File:Gold - world production trend.svg|thumb|lang=en|Time trend of gold production]]
The World Gold Council states that as of the end of 2017, "there were 187,200 tonnes of stocks in existence above ground". This can be represented by a cube with an edge length of about 21 meters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gold.org/supply-and-demand/supply |title=Gold Supply – Mining &amp; Recycling |publisher=World Gold Council}}&lt;/ref&gt; At $1,349 per [[troy ounce]], 187,200 metric tonnes of gold would have a value of $8.9 trillion.

{{as of|2017}}, the [[List of countries by gold production|world's largest]] gold producer by far was [[Gold mining in China|China]] with 455 [[metric ton|tonnes]]. The second-largest producer, [[List of gold mines in Australia|Australia]], mined 270 tonnes in the same year, followed by [[Russia]] with 250 tonnes.&lt;ref name="china2014" /&gt;

Since the 1880s, South Africa has been the source of a large proportion of the world's gold supply, and about 50% of the gold presently accounted is from [[South Africa]]. Production in 1970 accounted for 79% of the world supply, about 1,480 tonnes.  In 2007 [[China]] (with 276 tonnes) overtook South Africa as the world's largest gold producer, the first time since 1905 that South Africa has not been the largest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Mandaro |first=Laura |url=http://www.marketwatch.com/story/china-now-worlds-largest-gold-producer-foreign-miners-at-door |title=China now world's largest gold producer; foreign miners at door |publisher=[[MarketWatch]] |date=17 January 2008 |accessdate=5 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{as of|2014}}, [[Gold mining in China|China]] was the world's leading gold-mining country, followed in order by Australia, Russia, the United States, Canada, and Peru.

In South America, the controversial project [[Pascua Lama]] aims at exploitation of rich fields in the high mountains of [[Atacama Desert]], at the border between [[Chile]] and [[Argentina]].

Today about one-quarter of the world gold output is estimated to originate from artisanal or small scale mining.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |title=Removal of Barriers to the Abatement of Global Mercury Pollution from Artisanal Gold Mining |url=http://www.unido.org/fileadmin/import/10644_CHRISTIANtext.3.pdf |last=Beinhoff |first=Christian |accessdate=29 December 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160126032505/http://www.unido.org/fileadmin/import/10644_CHRISTIANtext.3.pdf |archivedate=26 January 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The city of [[Johannesburg]] located in South Africa was founded as a result of the [[Witwatersrand Gold Rush]] which resulted in the discovery of some of the largest natural gold deposits in recorded history.  The gold fields are confined to the northern and north-western edges of the [[Witwatersrand basin]], which is a 5–7&amp;nbsp;km thick layer of [[archean]] rocks located, in most places, deep under the [[Free State (South African province)|Free State]], [[Gauteng]] and surrounding provinces.&lt;ref name=Truswell&gt;Truswell, J.F. (1977). ‘’The Geological Evolution of South Africa’’. pp. 21–28. Purnell, Cape Town.&lt;/ref&gt; These Witwatersrand rocks are exposed at the surface on the [[Witwatersrand]], in and around Johannesburg, but also in isolated patches to the south-east and south-west of Johannesburg, as well as in an arc around the [[Vredefort crater|Vredefort Dome]] which lies close to the center of the Witwatersrand basin.&lt;ref name=McCarthy /&gt;&lt;ref name=Truswell /&gt; From these surface exposures the basin [[strike and dip|dips]] extensively, requiring some of the mining to occur at depths of nearly 4000&amp;nbsp;m, making them, especially the [[Mining#Records|Savuka]] and [[TauTona]] mines to the south-west of Johannesburg, the deepest mines on earth. The gold is found only in six areas where [[archean]] rivers from the north and north-west formed extensive pebbly [[Braided river]] deltas before draining into the "Witwatersrand sea" where the rest of the Witwatersrand sediments were deposited.&lt;ref name=Truswell /&gt;

The [[Second Boer War]] of 1899–1901 between the [[British Empire]] and the [[Afrikaner]] [[Boer]]s was at least partly over the rights of miners and possession of the gold wealth in South Africa.

During the 19th century, [[gold rush]]es occurred whenever large gold deposits were discovered. The first documented discovery of gold in the United States was at the [[Reed Gold Mine]] near Georgeville, North Carolina in 1803.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nchistoricsites.org/Reed/reed.htm |title=Reed Gold Mine State Historic Site |last=Moore |first=Mark A. |date=2006 |publisher=North Carolina Office of Archives and History |accessdate=13 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first major gold strike in the United States occurred in a small north Georgia town called [[Dahlonega, Georgia|Dahlonega]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Road to adventure |publisher=Georgia Magazine |last=Garvey |first=Jane A. |url=http://www.georgiamagazine.org/archives_view.asp?mon=7&amp;yr=2006&amp;ID=1344 |date=2006 |accessdate=23 January 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070302212304/http://www.georgiamagazine.org/archives_view.asp?mon=7&amp;yr=2006&amp;ID=1344 |archivedate=2 March 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Further gold rushes occurred in [[California Gold Rush|California]], [[Pike's Peak Gold Rush|Colorado]], the [[Black Hills Gold Rush|Black Hills]], [[Central Otago Gold Rush|Otago]] in New Zealand, [[Australian gold rushes|Australia]], [[Witwatersrand Gold Rush|Witwatersrand]] in South Africa, and the [[Klondike Gold Rush|Klondike]] in Canada.

{{Main|Gold extraction}}
[[Gold extraction]] is most economical in large, easily mined deposits. Ore grades as little as 0.5&amp;nbsp;parts per million (ppm) can be economical. Typical ore grades in [[open-pit mining|open-pit]] mines are 1–5&amp;nbsp;ppm; ore grades in underground or [[Underground mining (hard rock)|hard rock]] mines are usually at least 3&amp;nbsp;ppm. Because ore grades of 30&amp;nbsp;ppm are usually needed before gold is visible to the naked eye, in most gold mines the gold is invisible.

The average gold mining and extraction costs were about $317 per troy ounce in 2007, but these can vary widely depending on mining type and ore quality; global mine production amounted to 2,471.1 tonnes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last=O'Connell |first=Rhona |date=13 April 2007 |title=Gold mine production costs up by 17% in 2006 while output fell |url=http://www.mineweb.net/mineweb/view/mineweb/en/page33?oid=19485&amp;sn=Detail |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006084904/http://www.mineweb.net/mineweb/view/mineweb/en/page33?oid=19485&amp;sn=Detail |archivedate=6 October 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After initial production, gold is often subsequently refined industrially by the [[Wohlwill process]] which is based on [[electrolysis]] or by the [[Miller process]], that is chlorination in the melt. The Wohlwill process results in higher purity, but is more complex and is only applied in small-scale installations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Noyes |first=Robert |url=https://books.google.com/?id=__lqGczo9TwC&amp;pg=PA342 |page=342 |title=Pollution prevention technology handbook |publisher=William Andrew |date=1993 |isbn=978-0-8155-1311-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Pletcher |first=Derek |first2=Frank |last2=Walsh |url=https://books.google.com/?id=E_u9ARrm37oC&amp;pg=PA244 |page=244 |title=Industrial electrochemistry |last-author-amp=yes |publisher=Springer |date=1990 |isbn=978-0-412-30410-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other methods of assaying and purifying smaller amounts of gold include parting and inquartation as well as [[cupellation]], or refining methods based on the dissolution of gold in aqua regia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Marczenko |first=Zygmunt |last2=María |first2=Balcerzak, |url=https://books.google.com/?id=0NE1KjVISyAC&amp;pg=PA210 |page=210 |title=Separation, preconcentration, and spectrophotometry in inorganic analysis |last-author-amp=yes |publisher=Elsevier |date=2000 |isbn=978-0-444-50524-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Consumption ===

[[Real bills doctrine|Bills]] (that mature into gold coin) and [[gold certificates]] (convertible into gold coin at the issuing bank) added to the circulating stock of [[gold standard]] money in most 19th century industrial economies.
In preparation for [[World War I]] the warring nations moved to fractional gold standards, inflating their currencies to finance the war effort.
Post-war, the victorious countries, most notably Britain, gradually restored gold-convertibility, but international flows of gold via bills of exchange remained embargoed; international shipments were made exclusively for bilateral trades or to pay war reparations.

After [[World War II]] gold was replaced by a system of nominally [[convertible currency|convertible currencies]] related by fixed exchange rates following the [[Bretton Woods system]]. [[Gold standard]]s and the direct convertibility of currencies to gold have been abandoned by world governments, led in 1971 by the United States' refusal to redeem its dollars in gold. [[Fiat currency]] now fills most monetary roles. [[Switzerland]] was the last country to tie its currency to gold; it backed 40% of its value until the Swiss joined the [[International Monetary Fund]] in 1999.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/1999/04/19/world/swiss-narrowly-vote-to-drop-gold-standard.html | work=The New York Times | title=Swiss Narrowly Vote to Drop Gold Standard | date=19 April 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the prices of some [[platinum]] group metals can be much higher, gold has long been considered the most desirable of [[precious metal]]s, and its value has been used as the standard for many [[currency|currencies]]. Gold has been used as a symbol for purity, value, royalty, and particularly roles that combine these properties. Gold as a sign of wealth and prestige was ridiculed by [[Thomas More]] in his treatise ''[[Utopia (book)|Utopia]]''. On that imaginary island, gold is so abundant that it is used to make chains for slaves, tableware, and lavatory seats.

[[File:Gold price in USD.png|thumb|upright=1.35|Gold price history in 1960–2011]]

{{as of|2017|September|}}, gold is valued at around $42 per gram ($1,300 per troy ounce).

Like other precious metals, gold is measured by [[troy weight]] and by grams. The proportion of gold in the alloy is measured by ''[[Fineness#Karat|karat]]'' (k), with 24 karat (24k) being pure gold, and lower karat numbers proportionally less. The purity of a [[gold bar]] or coin can also be expressed as a decimal figure ranging from 0 to 1, known as the [[millesimal fineness|millesimal]] [[fineness]], such as 0.995 being nearly pure.

The price of gold is determined through trading in the gold and [[derivative (finance)|derivatives]] markets, but a procedure known as the [[Gold Fixing]] in [[London]], originating in September 1919, provides a daily benchmark price to the industry. The afternoon fixing was introduced in 1968 to provide a price when US markets are open.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Warwick-Ching |first1=Tony |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GrQQxVrtJ3sC&amp;pg=PA26 |page=26 |title=The International Gold Trade |isbn=978-1-85573-072-4  |date=28 February 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== History ===

Historically gold [[Mint (coin)|coinage]] was widely used as currency; when [[paper money]] was introduced, it typically was a [[receipt]] redeemable for gold coin or [[bullion]]. In a [[monetary]] system known as the [[gold standard]], a certain [[weight]] of gold was given the name of a unit of currency. For a long period, the United States government set the value of the US dollar so that one [[troy ounce]] was equal to $20.67 ($0.665 per gram), but in 1934 the dollar was devalued to $35.00 per troy ounce ($0.889/g). By 1961, it was becoming hard to maintain this price, and a pool of US and European banks agreed to manipulate the market to prevent further [[devaluation|currency devaluation]] against increased gold demand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Elwell (Au) |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ztHyT2ew3QUC&amp;pg=PA10 |pages=11–13 |title=Brief History of the Gold Standard (GS) in the United States |isbn=978-1-4379-8889-5 |first1=Craig K. |date=1 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 17, 1968, economic circumstances caused the collapse of the gold pool, and a two-tiered pricing scheme was established whereby gold was still used to settle international accounts at the old $35.00 per troy ounce ($1.13/g) but the price of gold on the private market was allowed to fluctuate; this two-tiered pricing system was abandoned in 1975 when the price of gold was left to find its free-market level.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}} [[Central bank]]s still hold historical [[official gold reserves|gold reserves]] as a [[store of value]] although the level has generally been declining.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}} The largest gold depository in the world is that of the [[Federal Reserve System|U.S. Federal Reserve Bank]] in [[New York City|New York]], which holds about 3%&lt;ref name='ISAMPE 2006-11-22'&gt;{{cite web |first2=Christian |last2=Perwass |url=http://sinai.apphy.u-fukui.ac.jp/gcj/publications/gold/gold.pdf |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120127152357/http://sinai.apphy.u-fukui.ac.jp/gcj/publications/gold/gold.pdf |archivedate=27 January 2012 |title=The hidden beauty of gold |accessdate=10 May 2011 |last=Hitzer |first=Eckhard |date=22 November 2006 |website=Proceedings of the International Symposium on Advanced Mechanical and Power Engineering 2007 (ISAMPE 2007) between Pukyong National University (Korea), University of Fukui (Japan) and University of Shanghai for Science and Technology (China), November 22–25, 2006, hosted by the University of Fukui (Japan), pp. 157–167.

Because of the softness of pure (24k) gold, it is usually [[alloy]]ed with base metals for use in jewelry, altering its hardness and ductility, melting point, color and other properties. Alloys with lower [[Fineness|karat rating]], typically 22k, 18k, 14k or 10k, contain higher percentages of copper or other base metals or silver or palladium in the alloy.&lt;ref name="utilisegold"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20080619061619/http://www.utilisegold.com/jewellery_technology/colours/colour_alloys/ Jewellery Alloys].

The Japanese craft of [[Mokume-gane]] exploits the color contrasts between laminated colored gold alloys to produce decorative wood-grain effects.

By 2014, the gold jewelry industry was escalating despite a dip in gold prices. Demand in the first quarter of 2014 pushed turnover to $23.7 billion according to a [[World Gold Council]] report.

Gold [[solder]] is used for joining the components of gold jewelry by high-temperature hard soldering or [[brazing]]. If the work is to be of [[hallmark]]ing quality, the gold solder alloy must match the [[Fineness#Karat|fineness]] (purity) of the work, and alloy formulas are manufactured to color-match yellow and white gold. Gold solder is usually made in at least three melting-point ranges referred to as Easy, Medium and Hard. By using the hard, high-melting point solder first, followed by solders with progressively lower melting points, goldsmiths can assemble complex items with several separate soldered joints. Gold can also be made into [[gold thread|thread]] and used in [[embroidery]].

=== Electronics ===
Only 10% of the world consumption of new gold produced goes to industry,&lt;ref name="oil-price.com-worlds-gold-consumption 2011" /&gt; but by far the most important industrial use for new gold is in fabrication of corrosion-free [[electrical connectors]] in computers and other electrical devices. For example, according to the World Gold Council, a typical cell phone may contain 50&amp;nbsp;mg of gold, worth about 50 cents. But since nearly one billion cell phones are produced each year, a gold value of 50 cents in each phone adds to $500 million in gold from just this application.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.usfunds.com/slideshows/the-many-uses-of-gold/ Uses of gold] Accessed 4 November 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

Though gold is attacked by free chlorine, its good conductivity and general resistance to oxidation and corrosion in other environments (including resistance to non-chlorinated acids) has led to its widespread industrial use in the electronic era as a thin-layer coating on [[electrical connector]]s, thereby ensuring good connection. For example, gold is used in the connectors of the more expensive electronics cables, such as audio, video and [[USB]] cables. The benefit of using gold over other connector metals such as [[tin]] in these applications has been debated; gold connectors are often criticized by audio-visual experts as unnecessary for most consumers and seen as simply a marketing ploy. However, the use of gold in other applications in electronic sliding contacts in highly humid or corrosive atmospheres, and in use for contacts with a very high failure cost (certain [[computer]]s, communications equipment, [[spacecraft]], [[jet aircraft]] engines) remains very common.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |first=Krech |last=Shepard |first2=Robert John |last2=McNeill |first3=Carolyn |last3=Merchant |url=https://books.google.com/?id=G7JrhAy5phoC&amp;pg=PA597 |page=597 |title=Encyclopedia of world environmental history |volume=3 |last-author-amp=yes |publisher=Routledge |date=2004 |isbn=978-0-415-93734-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Besides sliding electrical contacts, gold is also used in [[Switch#Contacts|electrical contacts]] because of its resistance to [[corrosion]], [[electrical conductivity]], [[ductile|ductility]] and lack of [[toxicity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=General Electric Contact Materials|website=Electrical Contact Catalog (Material Catalog)|publisher=Tanaka Precious Metals|date=2005|url=http://www.tanaka-precious.com/catalog/material.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20010303213152/http://www.tanaka-precious.com/catalog/material.html|dead-url=yes|archive-date=3 March 2001|accessdate=21 February 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Switch contacts are generally subjected to more intense corrosion stress than are sliding contacts. Fine gold wires are used to connect [[semiconductor device]]s to their packages through a process known as [[wire bonding]].

For example, gold electrical wires were used during some of the [[Manhattan Project]]'s atomic experiments, but large high-current silver wires were used in the [[calutron]] isotope separator magnets in the project.

It is estimated that 16% of the world's gold and 22% of the world's silver is contained in electronic technology in Japan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.techradar.com/news/phone-and-communications/mobile-phones/japan-wants-citizens-to-donate-their-phone-to-make-2020-olympic-medals-1326938 |title=Japan wants citizens to donate their old phone to make 2020 Olympics medals |publisher=TechRadar |date=23 August 2016 |author=Peckham, James }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Medicine ===
Metallic and gold compounds have long been used for medicinal purposes. Gold, usually as the metal, is perhaps the most anciently administered medicine (apparently by shamanic practitioners)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/s10787-007-0021-x |title=Clinical pharmacology of gold |date=2008 |last1=Kean |first1=W.

L. |journal=Inflammopharmacology |volume=16 |issue=3 |pages=112–25 |pmid=18523733}}&lt;/ref&gt; and known to [[Dioscorides]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Moir |first1=David Macbeth |url=https://books.google.com/?id=wRN7YHIAM9AC&amp;pg=PA225 |title=Outlines of the ancient history of medicine  |date=1831}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mortier, Tom. [https://lirias.kuleuven.be/bitstream/1979/254/2/thesis_finaal.pdf An experimental study on the preparation of gold nanoparticles and their properties], PhD thesis, University of Leuven (May 2006)&lt;/ref&gt; In medieval times, gold was often seen as beneficial for the health, in the belief that something so rare and beautiful could not be anything but healthy. Even some modern [[esotericism|esotericists]] and forms of [[alternative medicine]] assign metallic gold a healing power.

In the 19th century gold had a reputation as a "nervine", a therapy for nervous disorders. [[Depression (mood)|Depression]], [[epilepsy]], [[migraine]], and glandular problems such as [[amenorrhea]] and [[impotence]] were treated, and most notably [[alcoholism]] (Keeley, 1897).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Richards |first=Douglas G. |last2=McMillin |first2=David L. |last3=Mein |first3=Eric A. |last4=Nelson |first4=Carl D. |last-author-amp=yes |title=Gold and its relationship to neurological/glandular conditions |journal=The International Journal of Neuroscience |volume=112 |issue=1 |pages=31–53 |date=January 2002 |pmid=12152404 |doi=10.1080/00207450212018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The apparent paradox of the actual toxicology of the substance suggests the possibility of serious gaps in the understanding of the action of gold in physiology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1006/biol.1997.0123 |pmid=9637749 |title=Gold, the Noble Metal and the Paradoxes of its Toxicology |date=1998 |last1=Merchant |first1=B. |journal=Biologicals |volume=26 |pages=49–59 |issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Only salts and radioisotopes of gold are of pharmacological value, since elemental (metallic) gold is inert to all chemicals it encounters inside the body (i.e., ingested gold cannot be attacked by stomach acid). Some gold salts do have [[anti-inflammatory]] properties and at present two are still used as pharmaceuticals in the treatment of arthritis and other similar conditions in the US ([[sodium aurothiomalate]] and [[auranofin]]). These drugs have been explored as a means to help to reduce the pain and swelling of [[rheumatoid arthritis]], and also (historically) against [[tuberculosis]] and some parasites.&lt;ref name="Messorri"&gt;{{Cite book |first=L. |last=Messori |first2=G. |last2=Marcon |url=https://books.google.com/?id=wgifUs8dFbgC&amp;pg=PA279 |chapter=Gold Complexes in the treatment of Rheumatoid Arthritis |title=Metal ions and their complexes in medication |editor-last=Sigel |editor-first=Astrid |publisher=CRC Press |date=2004 |isbn=978-0-8247-5351-1 |pages=280–301}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gold alloys are used in [[restorative dentistry]], especially in tooth restorations, such as [[crown (dentistry)|crowns]] and permanent [[bridge (dentistry)|bridges]]. The gold alloys' slight malleability facilitates the creation of a superior molar mating surface with other teeth and produces results that are generally more satisfactory than those produced by the creation of porcelain crowns. The use of gold crowns in more prominent teeth such as incisors is favored in some cultures and discouraged in others.

[[Colloidal gold]] preparations (suspensions of [[gold nanoparticle]]s) in water are intensely red-[[color]]ed, and can be made with tightly controlled particle sizes up to a few tens of nanometers across by reduction of gold chloride with [[citrate]] or [[ascorbate]] ions. Colloidal gold is used in research applications in medicine, biology and [[materials science]]. The technique of [[immunogold labeling]] exploits the ability of the gold particles to adsorb protein molecules onto their surfaces. Colloidal gold particles coated with specific antibodies can be used as probes for the presence and position of antigens on the surfaces of cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |doi=10.1016/0019-2791(71)90496-4 |pmid=4110101 |date=1971 |last1=Faulk |first1=W.

Gold, or alloys of gold and [[palladium]], are applied as conductive coating to biological specimens and other non-conducting materials such as plastics and glass to be viewed in a [[scanning electron microscope]]. The coating, which is usually applied by [[sputtering]] with an [[argon]] [[plasma (physics)|plasma]], has a triple role in this application. Gold's very high electrical conductivity drains [[electric charge|electrical charge]] to earth, and its very high density provides stopping power for electrons in the [[electron beam]], helping to limit the depth to which the electron beam penetrates the specimen. This improves definition of the position and topography of the specimen surface and increases the [[Angular resolution|spatial resolution]] of the image. Gold also produces a high output of [[secondary emission|secondary electrons]] when irradiated by an electron beam, and these low-energy electrons are the most commonly used signal source used in the scanning electron microscope.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Bozzola |first=John J. |last2=Russell |first2= Lonnie Dee |url=https://books.google.com/?id=RqSMzR-IXk0C&amp;pg=PA65 |page=65 |title=Electron microscopy: principles and techniques for biologists |last-author-amp=yes |publisher=Jones &amp; Bartlett Learning |date=1999 |isbn=978-0-7637-0192-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Metallic gold is approved as a [[food additive]] in the EU ([[E number|E175]] in the [[Codex Alimentarius]]). Although the gold ion is toxic, the acceptance of metallic gold as a food additive is due to its relative chemical inertness, and resistance to being corroded or transformed into soluble salts (gold compounds) by any known chemical process which would be encountered in the human body.

Soluble compounds ([[gold salts]]) such as [[gold(I,III) chloride|gold chloride]] are toxic to the liver and kidneys. Common [[cyanide]] salts of gold such as potassium gold cyanide, used in gold [[electroplating]], are toxic by virtue of both their cyanide and gold content.

'''Hot dark matter''' ('''HDM''') is a theoretical form of [[dark matter]] which consists of particles that travel with [[ultrarelativistic]] velocities.

[[Dark matter]] is a form of matter that neither emits nor absorbs light. Within physics, this behavior is characterized by dark matter not interacting with [[electromagnetic radiation]], hence making it ''dark'' and rendering it undetectable via conventional instruments in physics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=McGaugh|first=Stacy|date=2007|title=Seeing through Dark Matter|jstor=20037494|journal=Science|volume=317|issue=5838|pages=607–608}}&lt;/ref&gt; Data from [[galaxy rotation curve]]s indicate that approximately 80% of the mass of a galaxy cannot be seen, forcing researchers to innovate ways that ''indirectly'' detect it through dark matter's effects on gravitational fluctuations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Drake|first=Nadia|date=2012|title=Dark matter, where art thou?|jstor=41697649|journal=Science News|volume=181|issue=10|pages=5–6}}&lt;/ref&gt; There exists no consensus in the theoretical physics community as to whether dark matter is divisible into various 'types', but there exists evidence for differentiating dark matter into "hot" (HDM) and "[[Cold dark matter|cold]]" (CDM) types–some even suggesting a middle-ground of [[Warm dark matter|"warm" dark matter]] (WDM). The terminology is not meant to invoke any association with temperature, but instead refer to the ''size'' of the purported dark matter particles ([[Weakly interacting massive particles|WIMPs]]). In turn, the size of the particles determines the velocities at which they travel at in an inverse relationship: HDM travels faster than CDM because the HDM particles are theorized to be of lower mass.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|author=Matt Williams|date=August 31, 2016|url=https://phys.org/news/2016-08-dark-matterhot.html|title=Dark matter—hot or not?|access-date=June 2, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Role in Galaxy Formation ==
[[File:Dark Matter Cloud.png|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Dark%20Matter%20Cloud.png|thumb|Artist’s impression of dark matter surrounding the Milky Way. Credit: ESO/L. Calçada]]
In terms of its application, the distribution of Hot dark matter could also help explain how [[Galaxy cluster|clusters]] and [[supercluster]]s of [[Galaxy|galaxies]] formed after the [[Big Bang]]. Theorists claim that there exist two classes of dark matter: 1) those that "congregate around individual members of a cluster of visible galaxies" and 2) those that encompass "the clusters as a whole." Because Cold dark matter possesses a lower velocity, it could be the source of "smaller, galaxy-sized lumps," as shown in the image.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cowen|first=R.|date=1996|title=Tracing the Architecture of Dark Matter|jstor=3979991|journal=Science News|volume=149|issue=6|pages=87–87|doi=10.2307/3979991}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hot dark matter, then, should correspond to the formation of larger mass aggregates that surround whole galaxy clusters. However, data from the [[cosmic microwave background]] radiation, as measured by the [[Cosmic Background Explorer|COBE]] satellite, is highly uniform, and such high-velocity Hot dark matter particles cannot form clumps as small as galaxies beginning from such a smooth initial state, highlighting a discrepancy in what dark matter theory and the actual data are saying. Theoretically, in order to explain relatively small-scale structures in the [[Universe|observable Universe]], it is necessary to invoke Cold dark matter or WDM. In other words, Hot dark matter being the sole substance in explaining cosmic galaxy formation is no longer viable, placing Hot dark matter under the larger umbrella of [[mixed dark matter]] (MDM) theory.

== Neutrinos ==
An example of a hot dark matter particle is the [[neutrino]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hannestad|first=Steen|last2=Mirizzi|first2=Alessandro|last3=Raffelt|first3=Georg G.|last4=Wong|first4=Yvonne Y.

They interact by the [[weak interaction]], and [[gravity]], but due to the feeble strength of these forces, they are difficult to detect. A number of projects, such as the [[Super-Kamiokande]] neutrino observatory, in [[Gifu, Gifu|Gifu]], [[Japan]] are currently studying these neutrinos.

[[File:Idle free zone - turn engine off sign.jpg|thumb|Idle free zone turn engine off sign]]
'''Idle reduction''' describes technologies and practices that minimize the amount of time drivers idle their engines. Avoiding idling time has a multitude of benefits including: savings in fuel and maintenance costs, extending vehicle life, and reducing damaging emissions. An idling engine consumes only enough power to keep itself and its accessories running, therefore, producing no usable power to the [[drive train]].

For cargo ships, the need to run the ship's engines for power in port is eliminated by techniques collectively described as [[cold ironing]]. 

Idle reduction equipment is aimed at reducing the amount of energy wasted by idling trucks, rail locomotives or automobiles. When a vehicle's [[Internal combustion engine|engine]] is not being used to move the vehicle, it can be shut off entirely — thereby conserving fuel and reducing emissions— while other functions like accessories and lighting are powered by an electrical source other than the vehicle's [[alternator]]. Each year, long-duration idling of truck and locomotive engines emits 11 million tons of [[carbon dioxide]], 200,000 tons of [[Nitrogen oxide|oxides of nitrogen]], and 5,000 tons of [[Atmospheric particulate matter|particulate]] matter into the air.&lt;ref&gt;[http://epa.gov/smartway/transport/what-smartway/idling-reduction.htm What SmartWay Can Do For You: Idling Reduction]&lt;/ref&gt;

There are other technologies&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eere.energy.gov/afdc/vehicles/idle_reduction_related.html Idle Reduction Related Links]&lt;/ref&gt; that can reduce the use of fuel to heat or cool the cab when the vehicle is traditionally idling overnight. These can be battery or fuel powered but in either case, use less fuel, do no harm to the vehicle's engine, and reduce or eliminate emissions. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.makealeap.org/node/119 6.24.08 Automotive Engineering Online: Cool truck technology is heating up]&lt;/ref&gt;  Other vehicles, including police, military, service trucks, news vans, fire trucks, ambulances, and hydraulic bucket trucks can be equipped with mobile power idle reduction systems, similar to a rechargeable battery.  The systems are usually installed in the trunk and can provide up to 10 hours of additional power for equipment operation without engine engagement. When used by law enforcement and the military, idle reduction technology increases mission capability by extending operational time and providing increased situational awareness and safety.

Idle reduction is a rapidly growing trend in US federal, state, local and fleet policy.{{Citation needed|date=November 2013}} Idling contributes significantly to the transportation sector’s portion of yearly greenhouse gas emissions. The US Department of Energy is putting forth a huge effort through the Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy Program to increase public awareness about decreasing petroleum use; idle-reduction being one of the methods. The Alternative Fuels and Advanced Vehicles Data Center is a reliable resource for information regarding idle-reduction methods such as fuel-operated heaters, auxiliary power units and truck stop electrification.&lt;ref name="afdc.energy.gov"&gt;http://www.afdc.energy.gov/afdc/vehicles/idle_reduction_electrification.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background and problem==

In the public sector, idling is common.  Police officers, public works employees, fire fighters, and EMTs who operate city fleet vehicles run them at idle to perform their duties which require them to operate equipment. The emissions generated from these tasks by cities all over the U.S. contribute to the fact that each year U.S. passenger cars, light trucks, medium-duty trucks, and heavy-duty vehicles consume more than 6 billion gallons of diesel fuel and gasoline — without even moving.  As fuel prices continue to rise, a major challenge in fleet management is how to keep service vehicles on the road to serve the public while staying within budget. 

Idle reduction is particularly significant for vehicles in heavy traffic and trucks at the estimated 5,000 [[truck stop]]s in the US.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Idle Reduction |publisher=[[U.S. Department of Energy]] |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070701205950/http://www.eere.energy.gov/cleancities/idle/ |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070701205950/http://www.eere.energy.gov/cleancities/idle/ |archivedate=July 1, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many [[hybrid electric vehicle]]s employ idle reduction to achieve better [[Fuel economy in automobiles|fuel economy]] in traffic. [[United States|America's]] fleet of around 500,000 long-haul trucks&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.afdc.energy.gov/afdc/vehicles/idle_reduction_what_is.html What is idle reduction?]&lt;/ref&gt; consumes over a billion gallons (3.8×10&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt; l; 830 million imp gal) of [[diesel fuel]] per year.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.epa.gov/smartway/idling.htm Dead link]&lt;/ref&gt;  The trucking industry has analyzed the impact of idling on engines, both in terms of maintenance and engine wear costs. Long-duration idling causes more oil and oil filter deterioration and increases the need for more oil and filter changes. Similarly, the longer the idling time, the sooner the engine itself will need to be rebuilt. The trucking industry estimates that long duration idling costs the truck owner $1.13 per day, based on the need for more frequent oil changes and sooner overhaul costs. Services such as [[AireDock]], [[IdleAire]] and Shorepower&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.shorepower.com Shorepower]&lt;/ref&gt; provide power at truck stops to resting truckers who would otherwise need to continue idling during mandatory breaks. Because the [[United States Department of Transportation]] mandates that truckers rest for 10 hours after driving for 11 hours, truckers might park at truck stops for several hours. Often they idle their engines during this rest time to provide their sleeper compartments with air conditioning or heating or to run electrical appliances such as refrigerators or televisions. 

The problem of anti-idling is most commonly associated with heavy duty diesel engines because they are the biggest contributors when idling. As an example of the need for idling an engine, school bus drivers on a cold morning may go out to their bus and turn it on to warm up the engine in order to provide direct heat to the cabin when they return to their bus to start their morning routes, which brings up two of the main reasons for idling, driver mentality and the need for passenger comfort. This idling period can be considered excessive, though excessive idling is defined and regulated differently in different parts of the country.

==In the United States ==

Policies at the federal level are more focused towards [[research and development]] of technologies, [[economic incentive]]s, and [[education]]. The [[United States Department of Energy|Department of Energy]] (DOE) is sponsoring several corporate companies in the R&amp;D of new anti-idling technologies with the hope that this technology will be installed and incorporated in the [[assembly line]] or possibly at the dealer as an option.&lt;ref&gt;http://www1.eere.energy.gov/vehiclesandfuels/pdfs/idling_news/sep04_network_news.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) also has many ways to promote idle reduction. The EPA established the [[SmartWay Transport Partnership]] that provides information about available anti-idling technologies, possible strategies for idle reduction, and resources for obtaining financing on anti-idling projects. The program also serves as an [[EnergyStar]]-like program with a label available to companies that commit “to improve the environmental performance of their freight delivery operations.” &lt;ref&gt;http://www.epa.gov/SmartwayLogistics/transport/what-smartway/swtp.htm&lt;/ref&gt; The EPA has a national campaign called the Clean School Bus Campaign which works to reduce diesel fuel consumption in school buses across the nation. Several regions were awarded millions of dollars through grant projects including idle-reduction pilot projects.

Various states and localities have passed [[law]]s pertaining to idling. Some of the laws are more strict and stringent than others. Thirty-one states currently have some sort of existing regulations pertaining to anti-idling. Of these states, California has the most codes and regulations. The California Air Resources Board has enacted numerous laws that regulate idling in the state. For example, in [[Virginia]], the excessive idling threshold is ten minutes, though, in many west coast states such as [[Hawaii]] and [[California]], where there is a larger presence of greener policies in relation to [[fuel consumption]], the thresholds are drastically smaller and may even have no idling tolerance at all. According to Hawaii Administrative Rules §11-60.1-34, no idling is permitted “while the motor vehicle is stationary at a loading zone, parking or servicing area, route terminal, or other off street areas” &lt;ref name="epa.gov"&gt;http://www.epa.gov/smartway/documents/420b06004.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; with a couple of exceptions. “Each year, long-duration idling of [[truck]] and [[locomotive]] engines consumes over {{convert|1|e9USgal|m3}} of diesel fuel and emits 11 million tons of [[carbon dioxide]], 200,000 tons of [[Nitrogen oxide|oxides of nitrogen]], and 5,000 tons of [[Atmospheric particulate matter|particulate matter]] into the air.” &lt;ref&gt;http://epa.gov/smartway/transport/what-smartway/idling-reduction.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

At the local level, there are many municipalities that have enacted anti-idling regulations.  New York is an example of states making their idling policies more strict. In early 2009, New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg signed legislation that reduced the amount of time non-emergency vehicles could idle when they are located near schools. The new legislation reduced the allowed idling time from three minutes to one minute. In addition, the new law authorized the Department of Parks and Recreation and the Department of Sanitation to enforce the new idling laws. Previously, only the police department and the Department of Environmental Protection had this authority. Civilians are also allowed to report violations under the new law.&lt;ref name="globalclimatelaw.com"&gt;http://www.globalclimatelaw.com/2009/02/articles/environmental/new-york-city-strengthens-antiidling-laws-reflecting-nationwide-trend-of-state-and-local-idling-regulation/&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2017, the [[City of Palo Alto]] began considering a proposal to stop drivers from running engines when parked.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Anti-ideling proposal steers toward education |author=Linda Taaffe |date=December 15, 2017 |page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Truckers argue for the need for idling to keep their cabins comfortable overnight at truck stops. Further complaints have come from the lack of concurrence among state and local idling laws. This disparity in laws requires truckers travelling across the country to be aware of the local idling laws in every place they visit. Even consistency between state and local laws has been a concern. Some truckers have expressed concern that some idling laws could prevent them from complying with other laws, For example, laws requiring truckers to get a certain amount of uninterrupted rest might be interfered with by anti-idling laws.&lt;ref name="globalclimatelaw.com"/&gt; The transportation blog uShip.com, Ship Happens states that “[anti-idling] laws fail to consider the truckers well-being and place drivers at risk of debilitating fines for noncompliance.” These fines could run as high as $25,000 in Connecticut for idling for more than three minutes.&lt;ref&gt;http://blog.uship.com/us/2008/12/negative-consequences-of-anti-idling-legislation.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==United Kingdom==
{{main|Air pollution in the United Kingdom}}
Unnecessary vehicle idling is an offence against the Road Traffic (Vehicle Emissions) (Fixed Penalty) (England) Regulations ([[List of Statutory Instruments of the United Kingdom, 2002|Statutory Instrument 2002]] No. 1808).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2002/1808/contents/made&lt;/ref&gt; It is unclear whether Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland have similar regulations.

The regulations apply in zones designated as [[Air quality management area]]s by local authorities.
The [[Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs]] has published a list of local authorities with air quality management areas.&lt;ref&gt;http://uk-air.defra.gov.uk/aqma/list&lt;/ref&gt;

==Europe==

In Europe,  vehicle increasingly include a [[Start-stop system]] to prevent idling. {{cn|date=February 2018}}

==Hong Kong==
{{main|Air pollution in Hong Kong}}
Hong Kong introduced an [[Clean_Air_Network#Anti-Idling_Bill|anti-idling bill]] in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.legco.gov.hk/yr09-10/english/bc/bc06/minutes/bc0620100601.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Technologies==

===Fuel-operated coolant heaters===
There are a variety of reasons that [[bus driver]]s idle their engines. The majority of engine idling occurs in the morning, when drivers are warming up the engines and the passenger compartments. Part of the problem with excessive idling, other than the immense amount of fuel it uses, is driver mentality coming from lack of knowledge about the fuel consumption of an idling engine. Typically, a bus driver will turn on the bus when they wake up, then proceed to get ready for the day, creating a period of excessive idling of up to half an hour. The objective of fuel-operated heaters is to eliminate this specific need for idling, which in turn reduces fuel consumption and costs. This technology works by using the [[coolant]] system to warm the engine, and the “[[thermal energy]] gained is then distributed through the vehicle's own heat exchanger as forced hot air. This [process] heats the interior of the vehicle via existing air vents. The engine is [also] warmed up with the residual heat in the cooling water”.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.espar.com/html/products/coolantheaters.html&lt;/ref&gt; In general, coolant heaters burns eight times less fuel that an idling engine would, simultaneously emitting 1/20th of the emissions and directing heat significantly faster to the passenger compartment. Coolant heaters are also much more efficient than an engine. For example, according to the manufacturer, the Webasto TSL-17 is upwards of 82% efficient, whereas a diesel engine has no more than half that efficiency.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.techwebasto.com/heater_main/5000838A.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

===Auxiliary power units===
[[Auxiliary power unit]]s (APUs) are commonly used on [[semi-truck]]s to provide [[electric power]] to the cabin at times when the cabin or cargo need to be heated or cooled while the vehicle is not in motion for an extended period of time. This period of time is usually overnight, when the truck driver has parked at a [[truck stop]] for some rest. Instead of having to keep the engine idling all night just to maintain the temperature in the cabin, the APU can turn on and provide power. Most commonly, the APU will have its own cooling system, heating system, generator, and [[air conditioning]] compressor. Sometimes the APU will be integrated into those components of the semi itself. APUs are also commonly used in police cruisers as an alternative to idling. Since a significant amount of time is spent in the cruiser while stationary, idling becomes a major source of cost to police fleets, though, most police fleets have idling policies. The drawback of APUs on police cruisers is that they are normally kept in the trunk where they take up valuable space.

===Truck stop electrification===
{{main|Shorepower#Trucks}}

Federal safety regulations developed by the [[Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration]], require that truckers must rest ten hours for every eleven hours of consecutive driving.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Interstate Truck Driver’s Guide to Hours of Service.|url=http://www.fmcsa.dot.gov/rules-regulations/truck/driver/hos/fmcsa-guide-to-hos.PDF|publisher=Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration|accessdate=17 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As a result, drivers spend extended periods of time resting and sleeping inside the cabs of their trucks.  To maintain comfort and amenities, most long haul truck drivers idle their engines for close to ten hours per day to power their heating systems and air conditioners, generate electricity for on-board appliances, charge their vehicle’s batteries, and to warm their engines in colder weather.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Zietsman|first=Josias|author2=Mohamadreza Farzaneh |author3=William H. Schneider IV |author4=Jae Su Lee |author5=Paul Bubbosh |title=Truck Stop Electrification as a Strategy To Reduce Greenhouse  Gases, Fuel Consumption and Pollutant Emissions|journal=Transportation Research Board|year=2009|url=http://tse.tamu.edu/pdfs/Truck_Stop_Electrification_as_a_Strategy.pdf|accessdate=17 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Given that trucks typically consume 0.8 gallons (3.03 L) of diesel fuel per hour of idling, between 900 and 1,400 gallons  (3406 to 5300 L) of fuel are consumed each year per truck, resulting in significant [[greenhouse gas]] emissions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Reference Sourcebook for Reducing Greenhouse Gas Emissions from Transportation Sources|url=http://www.planning.dot.gov/FHWA_tool/reference_sourcebook.pdf|publisher=U.S. Department of Transportation Federal Highway Administration.|accessdate=17 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Truck-stop electrification (TSE) and auxiliary power unit technologies provide long-haul truckers with the ability to heat, cool, and power additional auxiliary devices at truck stops without requiring them to idle their engines.

The [[United States Department of Transportation]] estimates there are approximately 5,000 truck stops on the U.S. highway system that provide overnight parking, restrooms, showers, stores, restaurants and fueling stations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Truck Stop Electrification for Heavy-Duty Trucks|url=http://www.afdc.energy.gov/conserve/idle_reduction_electrification.html|publisher=United States Department of Energy}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[United States Department of Energy]]  maintains a website that lists current TSE sites throughout the United States.  As of October 2013, the website records 115 TSE stations throughout the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Truck Stop Electrification Locator|url=http://www.afdc.energy.gov/tse_locator/|publisher=U.S. Department of Energy|accessdate=17 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Truck stop electrification allows a trucker to “plug-in” to power their on and off-board electrical needs.  There are two types of truck stop electrification, on-board and off-board systems.  On board TSE solutions allow trucker’s the ability to recharge their batteries at truck stops via standard 120 Volt electrical outlets. Truckers can then utilize the truck’s batteries to power appliances and provide heating and cooling to the truck cab.  Typically, on-board TSE solutions require some vehicle modification.  Off-board TSE solutions do not typically require any vehicle modifications, as they provide heating and air conditioning services via an overhead unit and hose that connects to the truck’s window.  In addition to heating and cooling, these connections can also offer standard electrical outlets, internet access, movies and satellite programming.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Truck Stop Electrification|url=http://www.energy.ca.gov/2006publications/CEC-600-2006-001/CEC-600-2006-001-FS.PDF|publisher=California Energy Commission|accessdate=17 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Normally, private companies provide and regulate either system and can charge an hourly rate for services, typically around $1.00-$2.00 an hour.&lt;ref name="idling1"&gt;{{cite web|title=Truck Stop Electrification and Anti-idling as a Diesel Emissions Reduction Strategy at U.S. - Mexico Ports of Entry|url=http://www.epa.gov/region9/climatechange/pdfs/TSE_Otay_report.pdf|publisher=U.S. Environmental Protection Agency|accessdate=17 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Both of these options can generate revenue for truck stop operators, and decrease operating expenses for truckers relative to the cost of diesel fuel.  The cost of electricity to provide overnight power to trucks can save up to $3,240 of fuel that would normally be consumed by idling per parking space. Truck stop electrification can allow truck drivers to abide local idling regulations and reduce noise to neighboring establishments.&lt;ref name="afdc.energy.gov"/&gt;

The cost of implementing a single TSE site can vary greatly, depending on the type of technology that is employed.  Installation costs for technology that provides external power to  operate equipment on board a truck range from $4,500 to $8,500 per space, whereas the costs to provide a window based power unit (i.e. an off board apparatus) range from $10,000 to $20,000 per space.  Costs for an individual truck operator to install an on-board system capable of utilizing [[shore power]] from a TSE space can cost up to $2,000.&lt;ref name="idling1" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9769">'''The International Association of Oil &amp; Gas Producers''' ('''IOGP''') is the [[petroleum industry]]'s global forum in which members identify and share best practices to achieve improvements in health, safety, the environment, security, social responsibility, engineering and operations.

The association was formed in London in 1974&lt;ref&gt;http://www.iogp.org/About-IOGP#3880677-milestones&lt;/ref&gt; to develop effective communications between the upstream industry and the network of international regulators. Originally called the E&amp;P Forum (for ''oil and gas [[oil exploration|'''e'''xploration]] and [[oil production|'''p'''roduction]]''&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ogp.org.uk/pubs/254.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;), in 1999 the name International Association of Oil &amp; Gas Producers (IOGP) was adopted. Most of the world’s leading publicly traded, private and state-owned oil &amp; gas companies, oil &amp; gas associations and major [[upstream service]] companies are members. IOGP members produce 40% of the world’s oil and gas.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.iogp.org/About-IOGP&lt;/ref&gt;

==Co-operation with other bodies==
IOGP also [[advocacy|represent the interests]] of the upstream industry before international regulators and legislators in UN bodies such as the [[International Maritime Organization]] and the [[Commission for Sustainable Development]]. IOGP also works with the [[World Bank]] and with the [[International Organization for Standardization]] (ISO). It is also accredited to a range of regional bodies that include [[OSPAR]], the [[HELCOM|Helsinki Commission]] and the [[Barcelona Convention]], and provides a conduit for advocacy and debate between the upstream industry and the European Union (EU). This involves regular contact with the European Commission and the European Parliament.

== IOGP data reports ==

Every year, IOGP collects and publishes data on upstream operations worldwide, both onshore and offshore, from participating member companies and their contractor employees. The reports are free and publicly available.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.iogp.org/data-series#2673468-safety-performance-indicators&lt;/ref&gt;
The data covers:
* Occupational safety
* Environmental performance
* Process safety events
* Health management
* Land transport safety
* Aviation safety

'''Occupational safety:'''&lt;br /&gt;
[[File:FatalitiesFAR Graph 1985 2015.png|thumb|Fatalities and FAR graph (1985 - 2015)]]Since 1985, when IOGP started reporting annual trends in upstream safety data, there have been considerable improvements in industry performance.
Today, it is the industry’s largest database of safety performance, covering participating member company employees and their contractors onshore and offshore, worldwide.
Fatal incidents are analysed by incident category, activity and associated causal factors, and incident descriptions are provided for fatal incidents and high potential events.

'''Environmental performance:'''&lt;br /&gt;
IOGP has collected and published environmental data from its participating member companies on an annual basis since 2001. The objectives of this programme are to allow member companies to compare their performance with other companies in the sector; and increase transparency of industry operations.
The reports aggregate information at both global and regional levels, expressed within six environmental indicator categories:
* Gaseous emissions
* Energy consumption
* Flaring
* Aqueous discharges
* Non-aqueous drilling fluids retained on cuttings discharged to sea
* Spills of oil and chemicals

'''Process safety events:'''&lt;br /&gt;
Process safety is a disciplined framework for managing the integrity of operating systems and processes that handle hazardous substances. It relies on good design principles, engineering and operating and maintenance practices.
The process safety events (PSE) data are based on the numbers of Tier 1 and Tier 2 process safety events reported by participating IOGP member companies, separately for:
* Onshore and offshore
* Drilling and production
* Activities
* Consequences
* Material released
The data are normalized against work hours associated with drilling and production activities to provide PSE rates.

'''Health management:'''&lt;br /&gt;
IOGP (with [[IPIECA]]) has developed two tools to assess health leading performance indicators within individual companies. These enable performance comparison between different parts of a company and between participating companies.
The annual health leading performance indicators report illustrates the results submitted by participating companies for both tools and includes actual anonymous results for the year by company, trends over time and the potential benefits to health management in the industry.
Land transport safety
In April 2005, IOGP published Report No. 365, Land transportation safety recommended practice, a guideline designed to be applicable to all land transportation activities in the upstream oil and gas industry, including operators, contractors and subcontractors.
IOGP collects data on motor vehicle crashes and information submitted by participating member companies are published from 2008 onwards. Data are broken down by region and crash category. Data are further grouped to indicate the number of crashes that resulted in a rollover. This includes:
* Number of Motor Vehicle Crash (MVC) fatalities
* Number of Motor Vehicle Crashes for each reporting group and category
* Motor vehicle crash rate (Motor Vehicle Crashes per million kilometres) for each reporting group and category.

== Global Production Report ==
In 2018, IOGP published its Global Production Report.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.iogp.org/gpr|title=Global Production Report 2018 {{!}} IOGP|work=IOGP|access-date=2018-06-05|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is based on the latest ''BP Statistical Review of World Energy''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bp.com/en/global/corporate/energy-economics/statistical-review-of-world-energy.html|title=Statistical Review of World Energy {{!}} Energy economics {{!}} BP|website=bp.com|language=en|access-date=2018-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; and establishes an ''IOGP'' ''Production Indicator©'' (PI) – the level at which a region is able to meet its own oil or gas demand – for seven regions across the world. A PI higher than 100% means the region produces more than it needs to meet its own requirements and so can export.
[[File:Production Indicator table.jpg|alt=IOGP Production Indicator table for seven regions|thumb|IOGP production indicators for oil and gas in seven regions.]]
The main conclusion of the report is that demand growth and the annual depletion rate of 6% of existing fields are driving the need for investment to gain additional volumes.  Such investment will depend on regional and local policies that encourage responsible resource development.

==European Petroleum Survey Group==
In 2005, IOGP absorbed the '''European Petroleum Survey Group''' or '''EPSG''' (1986–2005) into its structure. EPSG was a scientific organization with ties to the European [[petroleum industry]] consisting of specialists working in applied [[geodesy]], [[surveying]], and [[cartography]] related to [[oil exploration]].  EPSG compiled and disseminated the EPSG [[geodesy|Geodetic]] Parameter Set, a widely used database of [[figure of the Earth|Earth ellipsoids]], [[geodetic datum]]s, [[geographic coordinate system|geographic]] and [[map projection|projected]] [[coordinate system]]s, [[units of measurement]], etc.

==IOGP Outstanding Young Professional Award (OYPA)==
The award, in association with the biennial SPE HSSE-SR International Conference, recognizes the achievements of an individual with fewer than 10 years of professional E&amp;P experience, who demonstrates professional accomplishments and evidence of outstanding talent, dedication and leadership in at least one aspect of health, safety, security, the environment and/or social responsibility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pennenergy.com/articles/pennenergy/2015/09/new-young-professional-award-aims-to-inspire-the-next-generation-of-oil-and-gas-professionals.html|title=New Young Professional Award aims to inspire the next generation of oil and gas professionals|publisher=Penn Energy|author= Stenner, Joey Mechelle|date=September 9, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Along with [[dihedral (aeronautics)|dihedral]], [[sweepback]], and [[weight distribution]], keel effect is one of the four main design considerations in aircraft [[Flight dynamics (aircraft)#Lateral modes|lateral stability]].&lt;ref name="FAA2017"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Administration|first1=Federal Aviation|title=Pilot's Handbook of Aeronautical Knowledge|date=2017|publisher=Skyhorse Publishing, Inc.|isbn=9781510726185|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=L5TfDQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT266&amp;dq=%22Keel+effect%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjWrs7U26LWAhUmiFQKHXNhB8UQ6AEIKDAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Keel%20effect%22&amp;f=false|accessdate=13 September 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mechanism==

Examples of sideforce-generating surfaces are the vertical stabilizer, rudder, and parts of the fuselage.  When an aircraft is in a [[Angle of sideslip|sideslip]], these surfaces generate sidewards [[Lift (force)|lift]] forces.  If the surface is above or below the [[center of gravity (aircraft)|center of gravity]], the sidewards lift forces generate a rolling moment.  This "rolling moment caused by sideslip" is "[[Dihedral (aircraft)|dihedral effect]]".  Keel effect is the contribution of these side forces to rolling moment (as sideslip increases), i.e. keel effect is the contribution of the side forces to dihedral effect.  Sideforce producing surfaces ''above'' the center of gravity will ''increase'' dihedral effect, while sideforce producing surfaces below the center of gravity will decrease dihedral effect.

Increased dihedral effect (helped or hindered by keel effect) results in a greater tendency for the aircraft to return to level flight when the aircraft is put into a bank. Or, reduces the tendency to diverge to a greater bank angle when the aircraft starts wings-level.

Keel effect is also called "Pendulum Effect" because a lower center of gravity increases the effect of sideways forces (above the center of gravity) in producing a rolling moment.  This is because the ''[[moment arm]] is longer'', ''not'' because of gravitational forces.  A low center of gravity is like a pendulum (which has a ''very'' low center of gravity).

The effect is an important consideration in [[seaplane]] design, where pontoon floats generate strong sideforces with a long moment arm.&lt;ref name="Flying1945"&gt;{{cite book|title=Flying Magazine|date=December 1945|pages=82|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=7Uq_TImQyQYC&amp;pg=PA82&amp;lpg=PA82&amp;dq=keel+effect&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=91mdj_aYTF&amp;sig=3pVdVYxFoKm0Bd2BMTcMsAftIbE&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwih35fKyJLWAhWnLcAKHZiED1w4ChDoAQhAMAY#v=onepage&amp;q=keel%20effect&amp;f=false|accessdate=13 September 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1415">In mathematics, a '''Kline sphere characterization,''' named after [[John Robert Kline]], is a [[topology|topological]] characterization of a two-dimensional [[sphere]] in terms of what sort of subset separates it.  Its proof was one of the first notable accomplishments of [[R. H. Bing]];  Bing gave an alternate proof using [[brick partitioning]] in his paper ''Complementary domains of continuous curves'' &lt;ref name="cdcc"&gt;Bing, R.H., Complementary domains of continuous curves, ''Fund. Math.'' '''36''' (1949), [http://matwbn.icm.edu.pl/ksiazki/fm/fm36/fm36131.pdf 303-318].&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[Curve|simple closed curve]] in a two-dimensional sphere (for instance, its equator) [[Connected space|separates]] the sphere into two pieces upon removal.  If one removes a pair of points from a sphere, however, the remainder is [[Connected space|connected]].  Kline's sphere characterization states that the converse is true:  If a nondegenerate [[Locally connected space|locally connected]] [[metric space|metric]] [[continuum (topology)|continuum]] is separated by any simple closed curve but by no pair of points, then it is a two-dimensional sphere.

The '''LIGNA''' (''ligna'' lat. = the woods), previously known as '''Ligna Plus''' ('''Ligna+''') is an industrial trade fair for the [[woodworking]] industry. It takes place in uneven years on the [[Hanover fairground]]. It is run by [[Deutsche Messe AG]] and the  Fachverband Holzbearbeitungsmaschinen section of [[VDMA]] e.V.

== History ==
Until 1975, the Ligna was part of the yearly [[Hannover Messe]]. Due to space constraints, it was decided to establish the woodworking section as a separate fair. Since then, the Ligna fair takes place biannually.

== Exhibitions ==
There are exhibitions of machines and tools from the following sections:
* [[Forestry]] and forest technology
* [[Sawmill]] technology
* [[Solid wood]] treatment
* [[Furnishing]]
* [[Carpentry]] companies

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3388">'''Lie-Nielsen Toolworks, Inc.''' is a family-owned business, established in 1981 and based in [[Warren, Maine]]. It manufactures a range of high quality [[hand tools]], primarily for woodworking, based on traditional designs.&lt;ref&gt;Garrett Hack and John S. Sheldon. The Handplane Book. Taunton Press: Newtown, CT. 2003. 236-239 {{ISBN|1561587125}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is best known for its [[plane (tool)|hand planes]]. Thomas Lie-Nielsen is the founder and CEO of Lie-Nielsen Toolworks.

==History==
In the late 1970s, Thomas Lie-Nielsen (pronounced "Lee-Neelsen"&lt;ref name="LN FAQ"&gt;[https://www.lie-nielsen.com/article/faq Lie-Nielsen's FAQ page]&lt;/ref&gt;) worked for Garry Chin's company, [[Garrett Wade]]. In 1981, Garrett Wade's supplier of an adapted [[Stanley Works|Stanley]] #95 edge trimming [[block plane]], Ken Wisner, was ready to leave the business, so Lie-Nielsen acquired the tooling, plans and components necessary for producing the #95.&lt;ref name="F&amp;C 63"&gt;Furniture &amp; Cabinetmaking issue 63, Lie-Nielsen Feature.&lt;/ref&gt;

Lie-Nielsen moved from New York to a farm in West Rockport, Maine, and began production of the plane in a tiny back-yard [[shed]]. The first of the new planes was delivered to Chinn in the autumn of 1981.&lt;ref name="F&amp;C 63"/&gt;

A few years later, Lie-Nielsen moved into a {{convert|384|sqft|m2|sing=on}} workshop on the farm, and started production on his second plane, the skew-angle block plane. In 1988, as business grew, Lie-Nielsen bought an {{convert|8000|sqft|m2|sing=on}} building in the town of Warren, Maine, which the company still occupies. In the mid-1990s, Lie-Nielsen moved the entire production to a {{convert|13000|sqft|m2|sing=on}} facility.&lt;ref name="F&amp;C 63"/&gt;

Today, the Lie-Nielsen Toolworks products compete with mass-produced tools from companies such as Stanley and Record, with sales in the order of 20,000 tools a year.&lt;ref name="F&amp;C 63"/&gt; The acquisition of the Independence Tool Co. in 1998 added [[hand saws]] to the product line, which has further expanded over the years to include over 50 different models of planes, in addition to [[spokeshave]]s, socket [[chisel]]s, [[screwdriver]]s, marking and [[metrology|measuring]] devices and [[workbench]] hardware.

==Construction==
 
Lie-Nielsen uses   [[bronze|manganese bronze]] and [[ductile iron]] castings, and [[cryogenics|cryogenically]] treated A-2 steel.

Manganese bronze, a very hard, strong alloy, is the material of choice for Lie-Nielsen tools because it is heavier than iron, doesn't rust, and won't crack if dropped. Where the use of bronze would result in excessive weight in a tool, ductile iron is used instead.

Lie-Nielsen products are expensive when compared to the mass-produced items from the likes of [[Stanley Works|Stanley]] and Record, but these higher prices   are often defended by comparing them with the prices paid 100 years ago for such things as Norris infill planes, which could cost up to "a couple of weeks' wages".&lt;ref name="Chinn price"&gt;Quote from Gerry Chinn in the F&amp;C feature&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Matrixx Initiatives, Inc. v. Siracusano''''', 563 U.S. 27 (2011), is a decision by the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] regarding whether a plaintiff can state a claim for [[securities fraud]] under §10(b) of the [[Securities Exchange Act of 1934]], as amended, [[Title 15 of the United States Code|15 U.S.C.]] [https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/15/78j- §78j(b)], and [[Securities and Exchange Commission]] Rule 10b-5, 17 [[Code of Federal Regulations|CFR]] §240.10b-5 (2010), based on a pharmaceutical company's failure to disclose reports of adverse events associated with a product if the reports do not find [[Statistical significance|statistically significant]] evidence that the adverse effects may be caused by the use of the product. In a 9–0 opinion delivered by Justice [[Sonia Sotomayor]], the Court affirmed the [[Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit]]'s ruling that the respondents, plaintiffs in a securities fraud class action against Matrixx Initiatives, Inc., and three Matrixx executives, had stated a claim under §10(b) and Rule 10b-5.

== Parties ==
* Petitioners: Matrixx Initiatives, Inc., Carl Johnson, William Hemelt, and Timothy Clarot (collectively "Matrixx")
* Respondents: James Siracusano and [[National Electrical Contractors Association|NECA]]-[[International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers|IBEW]] Pension Fund, on behalf of themselves and all others similarly situated who purchased Matrixx securities between October 22, 2003, and February 6, 2004

== Background ==
Petitioner Matrixx Initiatives, Inc., is a pharmaceutical company that sells cold remedy products through its wholly owned subsidiary Zicam, LLC. One of Zicam's main products is [[Zicam|Zicam Cold Remedy]] (Zicam), which is produced in the form of a nasal spray or gel containing the active ingredient [[zinc gluconate]]. On April 27, 2004, respondents brought a class action suit against petitioners, alleging that petitioners violated §10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act and SEC Rule 10b-5 by failing to disclose reports that Zicam could cause [[anosmia]], or loss of the sense of smell. Petitioners filed a motion to dismiss respondents' complaint for failure to state a claim. The [[United States District Court for the District of Arizona|District Court for the District of Arizona]] granted the motion [[without prejudice]],&lt;ref&gt;The district court's opinion is available at 2005 WL 39701.&lt;/ref&gt; reasoning that the allegation of user complaints were neither material nor statistically significant, and that respondents failed to allege [[scienter]]. Respondents appealed to the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, which issued a decision on October 28, 2009, to reverse and remand the judgement of the District Court.&lt;ref&gt;The decision of the Court of Appeals is reported at 585 F.3d 1167.&lt;/ref&gt; On March 23, 2010, petitioners filed their petition for a [[writ of certiorari]] to the Ninth Circuit with the United States Supreme Court.&lt;ref name="09-1156_pet"&gt;[http://www.scotusblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/09-1156_pet.pdf On Petition for a Writ of Certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit] (2010-03-23). Retrieved 2011-04-16.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Decision ==
On March 22, 2011, Justice Sotomayor delivered the 9–0 opinion that held "[r]espondents have stated a claim under §10(b) and Rule 10b-5", affirming 585 F.3d 1167.&lt;ref name="09-1156"&gt;[https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/10pdf/09-1156.pdf Matrixx Initiatives, Inc., et al. v. Siracusano, et al. Certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit] (2011-03-22). Retrieved 2011-04-16.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reactions to the decision ==
An article by [[Carl Bialik]] appearing in the [[Wall Street Journal]] on April 2, 2011, reported:&lt;ref name="Bialik"&gt;{{cite journal| last=Bialik | first=Carl | title=Making a stat less significant | journal=Wall Street Journal | date=2011-04-02 | url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748703712504576235683249040812 | accessdate=2011-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
In [the] opinion, the justices said companies can't only rely on statistical significance when deciding what they need to disclose to investors.

Amen, say several statisticians who have long argued that the concept of statistical significance has unjustly overtaken other barometers used to determine which experimental results are valid and warrant public distribution. "Statistical significance doesn't tell you everything about the truth of the hypothesis you're exploring," says Steven Goodman, an epidemiologist and biostatistician at the [[Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health]]. 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Erik Olson, a partner at the [[Morrison &amp;amp; Foerster]] law firm in San Francisco which filed an [[amicus brief]] on behalf of BayBio, said that the court's ruling risks leaving companies without a clear guideline for deciding when they need to disclose adverse events.&lt;ref name="Bialik"/&gt; Olson, Stephen Thau, and Stefan Szpajda wrote a press release stating:&lt;ref name="Olson"&gt;{{cite web| last=Olson | first=Erik J. |author2=Stephen Thau |author3=Stefan J. Szpajda | date=2011-03-22 | title=In ''Matrixx Initiatives, Inc. v.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Life sciences companies and other public companies can learn at least two lessons from the decision. First and foremost, be careful what you say. As the Court emphasized, the securities laws focus on false or misleading speech. "[C]ompanies can control what they have to disclose under these provisions by controlling what they say to the market." (Slip Op. at 16). Rash or categorical comments are far more likely to form the basis for a lawsuit than measured, careful statements about the facts.

Second, life sciences companies should consult carefully with lawyers regarding specific disclosures and policies and practices for disclosing adverse events.

{{Distinguish|antimatter}}
In [[physics]], '''mirror matter''', also called '''shadow matter''' or '''Alice matter''', is a hypothetical counterpart to ordinary matter.

==Overview==
Modern physics deals with three basic types of spatial [[symmetry]]: [[Reflection (mathematics)|reflection]], [[Rotation (mathematics)|rotation]], and [[Translation (physics)|translation]]. The known [[Elementary particle|elementary particles]] respect rotation and translation symmetry but do not respect [[P-symmetry|mirror reflection symmetry]] (also called P-symmetry or parity). Of the [[Four fundamental forces|four fundamental interactions]]—[[electromagnetism]], the [[strong interaction]], the [[weak interaction]], and [[gravitation|gravity]]—only the weak interaction breaks parity.

Parity violation in weak interactions was first postulated by [[Tsung Dao Lee]] and [[Chen Ning Yang]]&lt;ref name="lee"&gt;T. D. Lee and C. N. Yang, ''Question of Parity Conservation in Weak Interactions'', Phys. Rev. '''104''', 254&amp;ndash;258 (1956) [http://link.aps.org/abstract/PR/v104/p254 article], Erratum ibid '''106''', 1371 (1957) [http://link.aps.org/abstract/PR/v106/p1371 Erratum]&lt;/ref&gt; in 1956 as a solution to the [[Kaon#Parity violation|τ-θ puzzle]]. They suggested a number of experiments to test if the weak interaction is invariant under parity. These experiments were performed half a year later and they confirmed that the weak interactions of the known particles violate parity.&lt;ref name="wu"&gt;C. S. Wu, E. Ambler, R. W. Hayward, D. D. Hopes and R. R. Hudson, ''Experimental test of parity conservation in beta decay'', Phys. Rev. '''105''', 1413 (1957).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;R. L. Garwin, L.M. Lederman and M. Weinrich, ''Observations of the failure of conservation of parity and charge conjugation in meson decays: The magnetic moment of the free muon'', Phys. Rev. '''105''', 1415 (1957).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;J. J. Friedman and V. L. Telegdi, ''Nuclear emulsion evidence for parity nonconservation in the decay chain &lt;math&gt;\pi^{+}\rightarrow\mu^{+}\rightarrow e^{+}&lt;/math&gt;'', Phys. Rev. '''105''', 1681 (1957).&lt;/ref&gt;

However, parity symmetry can be restored as a fundamental symmetry of nature if the particle content is enlarged so that every particle has a mirror partner. The theory in its modern form was described in 1991,&lt;ref name="foot"&gt;R. Foot, H. Lew and R. R. Volkas, ''A model with fundamental improper space-time symmetries'', Physics Letters B272, 67 (1991)&lt;/ref&gt; although the basic idea dates back further.&lt;ref name="lee"/&gt;&lt;ref name="kob"&gt;I. Kobzarev, L. Okun and I. Pomeranchuk, ''On the possibility of observing mirror particles'', Sov. J. Nucl. Phys. '''3''', 837 (1966).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pav"&gt;M. Pavsic, ''External Inversion, Internal Inversion, and Reflection Invariance'', Int. J. Theor. Phys. '''9''', 229-244 (1974) [https://arxiv.org/abs/hep-ph/0105344 preprint].&lt;/ref&gt; Mirror particles interact amongst themselves in the same way as ordinary particles, except where ordinary particles have left-handed interactions, mirror particles have right-handed interactions. In this way, it turns out that mirror reflection symmetry can exist as an exact symmetry of nature, provided that a "mirror" particle exists for every ordinary particle. Parity can also be spontaneously broken depending on the [[Higgs potential]].&lt;ref name="ber"&gt;Z. Berezhiani and R. N. Mohapatra, ''Reconciling Present Neutrino Puzzles: Sterile Neutrinos as Mirror Neutrinos'', Phys. Rev. D '''52''', 6607-6611 (1995) [https://arxiv.org/abs/hep-ph/9505385 preprint].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="flv"&gt;R. Foot, H. Lew and R. R. Volkas, ''Unbroken versus broken mirror world: a tale of two vacua'', JHEP '''0007''', 032 (2000) [https://arxiv.org/abs/hep-ph/0006027 preprint].&lt;/ref&gt; While in the case of unbroken parity symmetry the masses of particles are the same as their mirror partners, in case of broken parity symmetry the mirror partners are lighter or heavier.

Mirror matter, if it exists, would need to interact weakly{{clarify|date=September 2016}} with ordinary matter. This is because the forces between mirror particles are mediated by mirror [[boson]]s. With the exception of the [[graviton]], none of the known bosons can be identical to their mirror partners. The only way mirror matter can interact with ordinary matter via forces other than gravity is via [[kinetic mixing]] of mirror bosons with ordinary bosons or via the exchange of [[Holdom particle]]s.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/h2g2/A1164052&lt;/ref&gt; These interactions can only be very weak. Mirror particles have therefore been suggested as candidates for the inferred [[dark matter]] in the universe.&lt;ref name="blin1"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Blinnikov S.

In another context{{which|date=September 2016}}, mirror matter has been proposed to give rise to an effective [[Higgs mechanism]] responsible for the [[electroweak symmetry breaking]]. In such a scenario, mirror [[fermion]]s have masses on the order of 1 TeV since they interact with an additional interaction, while some of the mirror [[boson]]s are identical to the ordinary gauge [[bosons]]. In order to emphasize the distinction of this model from the ones above{{which|date=January 2016}}, these mirror particles are usually called [[katoptron]]s.&lt;ref name=katoptrons&gt;{{cite journal | author = Triantaphyllou G | year = 2001 | title = Mass generation and the dynamical role of the Katoptron group | url = | journal = Mod.Phys. Lett. | volume = A16 | issue = | pages = 53–62 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=katoptrons2&gt;{{cite journal | author = Triantaphyllou G., Zoupanos'' G. | year = 2000 | title = Strongly interacting fermions from a higher dimensional unified gauge theory | url = | journal = Phys. Lett. | volume = B489 | issue = | pages = 420–426 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Observational effects==
===Abundance===
Mirror matter could have been diluted to unobservably low densities during the [[Cosmic inflation|inflation]] epoch. [[Sheldon Lee Glashow|Sheldon Glashow]] has shown that if at some high energy scale particles exist which interact strongly with both ordinary and mirror particles, [[Effective field theory|radiative corrections]] will lead to a mixing between [[photon]]s and [[mirror photon]]s.&lt;ref name="glas"&gt;S. L. Glashow, ''Positronium versus the mirror universe'', Phys. Lett. B '''167''', 35-36 (1986) [https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0370-2693(86)90540-X article].&lt;/ref&gt; This mixing has the effect of giving mirror electric charges a very small ordinary electric charge. Another effect of photon–mirror photon mixing is that it induces oscillations between [[positronium]] and mirror positronium. Positronium could then turn into mirror positronium and then decay into mirror photons.

The mixing between photons and mirror photons could be present in tree level [[Feynman diagram]]s or arise as a consequence of quantum corrections due to the presence of particles that carry both ordinary and mirror charges. In the latter case, the quantum corrections have to vanish at the one and two loop level Feynman diagrams, otherwise the predicted value of the kinetic mixing parameter would be larger than experimentally allowed.&lt;ref name="glas"/&gt;

An experiment to measure this effect is currently being planned.&lt;ref name="bad"&gt;A. Badertscher ''et al.'', ''An apparatus to search for mirror dark matter via the invisible decay of orthopositronium in vacuum'', Int. J. Mod. Phys. A '''19''', 3833-3848 (2004) [https://arxiv.org/abs/hep-ex/0311031 preprint].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dark matter===
If mirror matter does exist in large abundances in the universe and if it interacts with ordinary matter via photon-mirror photon mixing, then this could be detected in dark matter direct detection experiments such as [[DAMA/NaI]] and its successor [[DAMA/LIBRA]]. In fact, it is one of the few dark matter candidates which can explain the positive DAMA/NaI dark matter signal whilst still being consistent with the null results of other dark matter experiments.&lt;ref name="foot3"&gt;R. Foot, ''Implications of the DAMA and CRESST experiments for mirror matter-type dark matter'', Phys. Rev. D '''69''', 036001 (2004) [https://arxiv.org/abs/hep-ph/0308254 preprint].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="foot4"&gt;R. Foot, ''Reconciling the positive DAMA annual modulation signal with the negative results of the CDMS II experiment'', Mod. Phys. Lett. A '''19''', 1841-1846 (2004) [https://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0405362 preprint].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Electromagnetic effects===
Mirror matter may also be detected in electromagnetic field penetration experiments&lt;ref name="mitra"&gt;S. Mitra, ''Detecting dark matter in electromagnetic field penetration experiments'', Phys. Rev. D '''74''', 043532 (2006) [https://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0605369 preprint].&lt;/ref&gt; and there would also be consequences for planetary science&lt;ref name="footm"&gt;R. Foot and S. Mitra, ''Mirror matter in the solar system: New evidence for mirror matter from Eros'', Astropart. Phys. '''19''', 739-753 (2003) [https://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0211067 preprint].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="footsil"&gt;R. Foot and Z.K. Silagadze, ''Do mirror planets exist in our solar system?'' Acta Phys. Polon. B '''32''', 2271-2278 (2001) [https://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0104251 abstract].&lt;/ref&gt; and astrophysics.&lt;ref name="adarp"&gt;A. De Angelis and R. Pain, ''Improved limits on photon velocity oscillations'', Mod. Phys. Lett. A '''17''', 2491-2496 (2002) [https://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0205059v1 preprint].&lt;/ref&gt;

===GZK puzzle===
Mirror matter could also be responsible for the [[Greisen-Zatsepin-Kuzmin limit#Cosmic ray paradox|GZK puzzle]]. [[Topological defect]]s in the mirror sector could produce mirror neutrinos which can oscillate to ordinary neutrinos.&lt;ref name="uhecrtd"&gt;V. Berezinsky and A. Vilenkin, ''Ultra high energy neutrinos from hidden-sector topological defects'', Phys. Rev. D '''62''', 083512 (2000) [https://arxiv.org/abs/hep-ph/9908257 preprint].&lt;/ref&gt; Another possible way to evade the GZK bound is via neutron–mirror neutron oscillations.&lt;ref name="uhecrn1"&gt;Z. Berezhiani and L. Bento, ''Neutron - Mirror Neutron Oscillations: How Fast Might They Be?'', Phys. Rev. Lett. '''96''', 081801 (2006) [https://arxiv.org/abs/hep-ph/0507031 preprint].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="uhecrn2"&gt;Z. Berezhiani and L. Bento, ''Fast Neutron - Mirror Neutron Oscillation and Ultra High Energy Cosmic Rays'', Phys. Lett. B '''635''', 253-259 (2006) [https://arxiv.org/abs/hep-ph/0602227 preprint].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="uhecrn3"&gt;R. N. Mohapatra, S. Nasri and S. Nussinov, ''Some Implications of Neutron Mirror Neutron Oscillation'', Phys. Lett. B '''627''', 124-130 (2005) [https://arxiv.org/abs/hep-ph/0508109 preprint].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="uhecrn4"&gt;Yu. N. Pokotilovski, ''On the experimental search for neutron -- mirror neutron oscillations'', Phys. Lett. B '''639''', 214-217 (2006) [https://arxiv.org/abs/nucl-ex/0601017 preprint].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gravitational effects===
If mirror matter is present in the universe with sufficient abundance then its gravitational effects can be detected. Because mirror matter is analogous to ordinary matter, it is then to be expected that a fraction of the mirror matter exists in the form of mirror galaxies, mirror stars, mirror planets etc. These objects can be detected using gravitational [[microlensing]].&lt;ref name="mohapatra"&gt;R. N. Mohapatra and V. L. Teplitz, ''Mirror matter MACHOs.'' Phys. Lett. B, '''462''', 302 - 309 (1999) [http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1999PhLB..462..302M article].&lt;/ref&gt; One would also expect that some fraction of stars have mirror objects as their companion. In such cases one should be able to detect periodic [[Doppler shift]]s in the spectrum of the star.&lt;ref name="khlp"/&gt;{{dead link|date=March 2017}} There are some hints that such effects may already have been observed.&lt;ref name="foot1"&gt;R. Foot, ''Have mirror stars been observed?'', Phys. Lett. B '''452''', 83-86 (1999) [https://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/9902065 preprint].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="foot2"&gt;R. Foot, ''Have mirror planets been observed?'', Phys. Lett. B '''471''', 191-194 (1999) [https://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/9908276 preprint].&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Mother Country: Britain, the Welfare State, and Nuclear Pollution''''' (1989) is a work of nonfiction by [[Marilynne Robinson]] that tells the story of [[Sellafield]], a government nuclear reprocessing plant located on the coast of the Irish Sea. The book shows how the closest village to Sellafield suffers from death and disease due to decades of waste and radiation from the plant. ''Mother Country'' was a [[National Book Award]] finalist for Nonfiction in 1989. While on sabbatical in England, Robinson's interest in the environmental ramifications of the plant began when she discovered a newspaper article detailing its hazards.&lt;ref name="kirkusreviews"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/marilynne-robinson-3/mother-country-2/|title=MOTHER COUNTRY by Marilynne Robinson &amp;#124; Kirkus|publisher=kirkusreviews.com|accessdate=2014-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Shannon L.

Directors of Native Wind include representatives of the [[Intertribal Council On Utility Policy]], [[Native Energy]], [[ICLEI]], [[Honor the Earth]] and American Spirit Productions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nativewind.org/html/about_us.html Native Wind]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy08osti/41609.pdf NAWIG News]&lt;/ref&gt; 

Two wind facilities have previously been built through Native Wind -- a 750kW turbine at the [[Rosebud Indian Reservation]] and another at the [[Fort Berthold Indian Reservation]] in North Dakota.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldchanging.com/archives/003721.html Native Wind]&lt;/ref&gt; 

The Indian tribes of the North and South Dakota and Nebraska are presently collaborating on a project to develop the large wind resources of the northern Great Plains. Eight separate tribes are moving ahead with plans to develop the first large-scale Native owned and operated [[wind farm]]s in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nativewind.org/html/projects.html Native wind projects]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Odeillo solar furnace''' is the world's largest [[solar furnace]]. It is situated in [[Font-Romeu-Odeillo-Via]], in the department of [[Pyrénées-Orientales]], in south of [[France]]. It is {{convert|54|m}} high and {{convert|48|m}} wide, and includes 63 heliostats. It was built between 1962 and 1968, and started operating in 1970, and has a power of one megawatt.

It serves as a science research site studying materials at very high temperatures.

== Geography ==
It is situated in [[Font-Romeu-Odeillo-Via]], in the department of [[Pyrénées-Orientales]], region of [[Languedoc-Roussillon]], in south of [[France]]. The site was chosen because:
* the length and the quality of sunshine with direct light (more than 2,500 h/year);&lt;ref&gt;http://www.actualitix.com/nombre-d-heures-d-ensoleillement-par-depa.html&lt;/ref&gt;
* the purity of its atmosphere (high altitude and low average humidity).

The [[Themis (solar power plant)|solar power plant of Themis]] and the [[Mont-Louis Solar Furnace]] are situated nearby.

== Working principle ==
[[File:Four en.svg|thumb|left|Working principle]]
[[File:Parabole.JPG|thumb|View to the East from the parabola center]]
[[File:Heliostat.JPG|thumb|One of the 63 heliostats]]
The principle used is the concentration of rays by reflecting mirrors (9,600 of them). The solar rays are picked up by a first set of steerable mirrors located on the slope, and then sent to a second series of mirrors (the ''concentrators''), placed in a parabola and eventually converging on a circular target, 40&amp;nbsp;cm in diameter, on top of the central tower. 

Equivalent to concentrating the energy of "10,000 suns", the solar furnace produces a peak power of 3200 Kw.

== Advantages ==
*Temperatures above {{convert|3500|C|F}} can be obtained in a few seconds. 
*The energy is "free", and non-polluting.
*This furnace provides rapid temperature changes and therefore allow studying the effect of thermal shocks;
*There are no contaminating element (combustion gas, pollution, waste, etc.), since only the object to be examined is heated only by radiation;
*This heating can be done in a controlled atmosphere (the vacuum of space, the upper atmosphere of Mars, etc.)

== Uses ==
The research areas are also extended to the aviation and aerospace industries. Experiments can be conducted there in conditions of high chemical purity.
The ''high temperature materials division'' use the furnace to evaluate [[radome]] survival during [[MIRV]] warhead earth re-entry along with investigating other material properties under the "high energy [[thermal radiation]] environment" frequently produced by "[[nuclear explosion|nuclear devices]]".&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20161003072910/http://www.gtri.gatech.edu/history/files/media/other-publications/High_Temp_Solar_Energy_Pamphlet.pdf High Energy Solar Energy]&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
In 1946 French chemist [[Felix Trombe]] and his team achieved in [[Meudon]] their first experience of using a DCA mirror. They demonstrated the ability to reach high temperatures very quickly, and in a very pure environment, using highly concentrated sunlight. Their aim was to melt ore and extract highly pure materials for making new and improved refractories.

To achieve this objective and test the various possibilities, a first solar furnace was built at Mont-Louis in 1949. Some years later, on the model of the Mont-Louis furnace and using the results obtained there, a solar furnace of almost industrial size was built at Odeillo. Work on the construction of the Great Solar Oven of Odeillo lasted from 1962 to 1968, and it was commissioned in 1970.

Being strong supporters of solar power, following the first oil shock of 1973, researchers at the Odeillo solar furnace made further progress in the conversion of solar energy into electricity.

== Public information center Héliodyssée ==
Since 1990, there has been an information center on the site which is open to the public, and is independent of the CNRS laboratory.

Designed for young and old, Héliodyssée allows you to discover, in an entertaining way, solar energy and its derivatives (other forms of renewable energy, and its uses in the home) and the work of researchers from CNRS on energy, environmental, materials for space, and materials of the future.

'''Radical sustainability''' recognizes that a system is not [[sustainable]] if any part of it is unsustainable. An [[economy]] cannot be sustained if the underlying [[social structure]] is unsustainable. A social structure cannot be sustained if the [[environment (biophysical)|environment]] it depends upon is unsustainable. Vice versa we find that in our modern day the environment cannot be sustained unless proper economical and social practices are in place.

{{Quote|text=A radical sustainability viewpoint recognizes the inseparability of [[environmental issues|ecological]] and [[social issues]] and the necessity of ensuring the solution to one problem does not create or worsen another.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Kellogg, S.|author2=Pettigrew, S.|year=2008|title=Toolbox for sustainable city living|publisher=South end press, Massachusetts|isbn=978-0896087804}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The [[wikt:Special:Search/radical|radical]] sustainable philosophy addressed problems of sustainability through a [[Top-down and bottom-up design|bottom-up approach]] - a form of "grass roots" sustainability.

Radical sustainability advocates and supports [[autonomy|autonomous]] development, [[Indigenous peoples|indigenous]] movements, [[women's rights]],  [[social justice]] and [[Green politics|green]] practices.

== Examples ==
There are widespread examples of radical sustainability including [[open source ecology]], [[rainwater harvesting]] (e.g. the projects by [[Brad Lancaster]]) and the [[Bushmen]] who live a life where social and environmental aspects are completely intertwined.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4391">In mathematics, a '''Rothberger space''' is a [[topological space]] that satisfies a certain a basic [[selection principle]]. A Rothberger space is a space in which for every sequence of open covers &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{U}_1, \mathcal{U}_2, \ldots&lt;/math&gt; of the space there are sets &lt;math&gt; U_1 \in \mathcal{U}_1, U_2 \in \mathcal{U}_2, \ldots&lt;/math&gt; such that the family &lt;math&gt;\{U_n:n\in\mathbb{N}\}&lt;/math&gt; covers the space.

== History ==
In 1938, Fritz Rothberger introduced his property known as &lt;math&gt;C''&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rothberger|first=Fritz|date=1938-01-01|title=Eine Verschärfung der Eigenschaft C|url=http://pldml.icm.edu.pl/pldml/element/bwmeta1.element.bwnjournal-article-fmv30i1p8bwm?q=bwmeta1.element.bwnjournal-number-fm-1938-30-1;7&amp;qt=CHILDREN-STATELESS|journal=Fundamenta Mathematicae|language=DE|volume=30|issue=1|issn=0016-2736}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Characterizations ==

=== Combinatorial characterization ===
For subsets of the real line, the Rothberger property can be characterized using continuous functions into the [[Baire space]] &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{N}^\mathbb{N}&lt;/math&gt;. A subset &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{N}^\mathbb{N}&lt;/math&gt; is guessable if there is a function &lt;math&gt;g\in A&lt;/math&gt; such that the sets  &lt;math&gt; \{n:f(n)=g(n)\}&lt;/math&gt; are infinite for all functions &lt;math&gt; f\in A&lt;/math&gt;. A subset of the real line is Rothberger iff every continuous image of that space into the Baire space is guessable. In particular, every subset of the real line of cardinality less than [[Cichoń's diagram|&lt;math&gt; \mathrm{cov}(\mathcal{M})&lt;/math&gt;]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=Nkzbkj-c83YC|title=Set Theory: On the Structure of the Real Line|last=Bartoszynski|first=Tomek|last2=Judah|first2=Haim|date=1995-08-15|publisher=[[Taylor &amp; Francis]]|isbn=9781568810447|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; is Rothberger.

=== Topological game characterization ===
Let &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; be a topological space. The Rothberger game &lt;math&gt;\text{G}_1(\mathbf{O},\mathbf{O})&lt;/math&gt; played on &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is a game with two players Alice and Bob.

'''1st round''': Alice chooses an open cover &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{U}_1&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;. Bob chooses a set &lt;math&gt;U_1\in \mathcal{U}_1&lt;/math&gt;.

'''2nd round''': Alice chooses an open cover &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{U}_2&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;. Bob chooses a finite set &lt;math&gt;U_2\in\mathcal{U}_2&lt;/math&gt;.

'''etc.'''

If the family &lt;math&gt;\{U_n:n\in\mathbb{N}\}&lt;/math&gt; is a cover of the space &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;, then Bob wins the game &lt;math&gt;\text{G}_1(\mathbf{O},\mathbf{O})&lt;/math&gt;. Otherwise, Alice wins.

A player has a winning strategy if he knows how to play in order to win the game &lt;math&gt;\text{G}_1(\mathbf{O},\mathbf{O})&lt;/math&gt; (formally, a winning strategy is a function).

===1847 to 1901===
[[File:Werner-von-Siemens.png|thumb|left|upright=0.75|[[Werner von Siemens]], co-founder of [[Siemens &amp; Halske]].]]
[[Siemens &amp; Halske]] was founded by [[Werner von Siemens]] and [[Johann Georg Halske]] on 12 October 1847. Based on the [[telegraph]], their invention used a needle to point to the sequence of letters, instead of using [[Morse code]]. The company, then called ''Telegraphen-Bauanstalt von Siemens &amp; Halske'', opened its first workshop on 12 October.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.siemens.com/history/en/news/1047_siemenshalsketelegraphconstructioncompany.htm | title=Founding of the 'Siemens &amp; Halske Telegraph Construction Company,' which later became Siemens AG | publisher=Siemens AG | accessdate=29 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1848, the company built the first long-distance telegraph line in Europe; 500&amp;nbsp;km from Berlin to [[Frankfurt am Main]]. In 1850, the founder's younger brother, Carl Wilhelm Siemens, later [[Carl Wilhelm Siemens|Sir William Siemens]], started to represent the company in London. The [[Siemens Brothers|London agency]] became a branch office in 1858. In the 1850s, the company was involved in building long distance telegraph networks in Russia. In 1855, a company branch headed by another brother, [[Carl Heinrich von Siemens]], opened in [[St Petersburg]], Russia. In 1867, Siemens completed the monumental [[Indo-European telegraph]] line stretching over 11,000&amp;nbsp;km from [[London]] to [[Kolkata|Calcutta]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://w4.siemens.de/archiv/en/laender/asien/indien.html |title=Siemens history |accessdate=12 January 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080120233553/http://w4.siemens.de/archiv/en/laender/asien/indien.html |archivedate=20 January 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:First electric locomotive, built in 1879 by Werner von Siemens.jpg|thumb|upright=1.05|First [[electric locomotive]], built in 1879 by company founder Werner von Siemens.]]
In 1867, Werner von Siemens described a [[dynamo]] without permanent magnets. A similar system was also independently invented by [[Charles Wheatstone]], but Siemens became the first company to build such devices. In 1881, a Siemens [[Alternating current|AC]] [[Alternator]] driven by a [[watermill]] was used to power the world's first electric street lighting in the town of [[Godalming]], United Kingdom. The company continued to grow and diversified into [[electric locomotive|electric trains]] and [[light bulbs]]. In 1887, it opened its first office in Japan.&lt;ref&gt;Siemens website [http://www.siemens.com/history/en/news/1125_japan.htm August 1, 2012 – 125 Years Siemens in Japan (1887–2012)] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305014307/http://www.siemens.com/history/en/news/1125_japan.htm |date=5 March 2016 }} Retrieved on 12 August 2013&lt;/ref&gt; In 1890, the founder retired and left running the company to his brother Carl and sons Arnold and Wilhelm.

Siemens &amp; Halske (S &amp; H) was incorporated in 1897, and then merged parts of its activities with Schuckert &amp; Co., Nuremberg in 1903 to become [[Siemens-Schuckert]].  In 1907, Siemens ([[Siemens &amp; Halske]] and [[Siemens-Schuckert]]) had 34,324 employees and was the seventh-largest company in the German empire by number of employees.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fiedler|first=Martin|year=1999|title=Die 100 größten Unternehmen in Deutschland – nach der Zahl ihrer Beschäftigten – 1907, 1938, 1973 und 1995|journal=Zeitschrift für Unternehmensgeschichte|publisher=Verlag C.H.

In 1919, S &amp; H and two other companies jointly formed the [[Osram]] [[lightbulb]] company.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}

In the 1920s, Siemens constructed the [[Shannon hydroelectric scheme|Ardnacrusha]] Hydro Power station on the [[River Shannon]] in the then [[Irish Free State]], and it was a world first for its design. The company is remembered for its desire to raise the wages of its under-paid workers only to be overruled by the [[Cumann na nGaedheal]] government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4161/is_20020804/ai_n12846719 |title=Ardnacrusha – Dam hard job |author= |date=4 August 2002 |work=[[Sunday Mirror]] |accessdate=18 September 2010 |first=Andrew |last=Bushe |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080221060803/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4161/is_20020804/ai_n12846719 |archivedate=21 February 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the final years of [[World War II]], numerous plants and factories in Berlin and other major cities were destroyed by Allied air raids. To prevent further losses, manufacturing was therefore moved to alternative places and regions not affected by the air war. The goal was to secure continued production of important war-related and everyday goods. According to records, Siemens was operating almost 400 alternative or relocated manufacturing plants at the end of 1944 and in early 1945.

In 1972, Siemens sued German satirist F.C. Delius for his satirical history of the company, ''Unsere Siemenswelt'', and it was determined much of the book contained false claims although the trial itself publicized Siemens' history in Nazi Germany.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.adl.org/braun/dim_13_2_forgetting_print.asp German Industry and the Third Reich: Fifty Years of Forgetting and Remembering] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121030133244/http://www.adl.org/braun/dim_13_2_forgetting_print.asp |date=30 October 2012 }}.

The factories had poor working conditions, where malnutrition and death were common. Also, the scholarship has shown that the camp factories were created, run, and supplied by the [[SS]], in conjunction with company officials, sometimes high-level officials.&lt;ref&gt;Anna Vavak: Siemens &amp; Halske AG in the women's concentration camp at Ravensbrück&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rosalux.de/publication/14103/siemens-amp-halske-im-frauenkonzentrationslager RLS – Siemens &amp; Halske im Frauenkonzentrationslager Ravensbrück] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160422045055/http://www.rosalux.de/publication/14103/siemens-amp-halske-im-frauenkonzentrationslager |date=22 April 2016 }}.

In 1991, Siemens acquired [[Nixdorf Computer AG]] and renamed it [[Siemens Nixdorf Informationssysteme]] AG, in order to produce [[personal computer]]s.&lt;ref name="WincorNixdorf"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wincor-nixdorf.com/internet/com/Company/History/index.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070602134044/http://www.wincor-nixdorf.com/internet/com/Company/History/index.html |archive-date=2007-06-02 |title=History: The Best of Both Worlds |publisher=Wincor Nixdorf |access-date=2018-10-10 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 1991, Siemens acquired the Industrial Systems Division of [[Texas Instruments]], Inc, based in [[Johnson City, Tennessee]]. This division was organized as Siemens Industrial Automation, Inc.,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Gálvez-Muñoz |first1=Lina |last2=Jones |first2=Geoffrey G |title=Foreign Multinationals in the United States |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=84tFnYRLaikC&amp;pg=PA104 |accessdate=2018-10-10 |date=2005-07-26 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=9781134532100 |page=104 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was later absorbed by Siemens Energy and Automation, Inc.

In 1992, Siemens bought out [[IBM]]'s half of [[ROLM]] (Siemens had bought into ROLM five years earlier), thus creating SiemensROLM Communications; eventually dropping ROLM from the name later in the 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1988/12/14/business/ibm-to-sell-rolm-to-siemens.html |title=I.B.M. to Sell Rolm to Siemens |last=Markoff |first=John |date=1988-12-14 |work=[[The New York Times]] |access-date=2018-10-10 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2005 and continuing: worldwide bribery scandal ===
In 2005 Germany opened investigations into Siemens business practices worldwide, prompted by requests from prosecutors in Italy, Liechtenstein and Switzerland; US investigators joined in 2006 and the US investigators addressed violations only since 2001, when Siemens started selling shares in a US stock exchange.&lt;ref name=NYThow&gt;{{cite news|last1=Schubert|first1=Siri|last2=Miller|first2=T. Christian|title=At Siemens, Bribery Was Just a Line Item|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/12/21/business/worldbusiness/21siemens.html?mcubz=2|work=The New York Times|date=20 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The investigators found that bribing officials to win contracts was [[standard operating procedure]].&lt;ref name=NYThow/&gt;&lt;ref name=WaPo2008&gt;{{cite news|last1=O'Reilly|first1=Cary|last2=Matussek|first2=Karin|title=Siemens to Pay $1.6 Billion to Settle Bribery Cases|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/12/15/AR2008121502926.html|work=The Washington Post|date=16 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Over that time period the company paid around $1.3 billion in bribes in many countries and kept separate books to hide them.&lt;ref name=WaPo2008/&gt;

Fines were anticipated to be as high as $5 billion as the investigation unfolded.&lt;ref name=Guardian2008&gt;{{cite news|last1=Gow|first1=David|title=Record US fine ends Siemens bribery scandal|url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/dec/16/regulation-siemens-scandal-bribery|work=The Guardian|date=15 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Settlement negotiations took place through most of 2008 and when they were announced in December they were far less, driven in part by Siemens' cooperation, in part by the imminent change in US administrations (the [[Obama administration]] was about to take over from the [[Presidency of George W. Bush|Bush administration]]), and in part by the dependence of the US military on Siemens as a contractor.&lt;ref name=NYThow/&gt;&lt;ref name=Guardian2008/&gt;&lt;ref name=WaPo2008/&gt;

The company paid a total of about $1.6 billion, around $800 million in each of the US and Germany.  This was the largest bribery fine in history, at the time.  The money paid to Germany included a $270 million fine paid the year before (related to bribes in Nigeria&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/7105582.stm|title=Nigeria probes Siemens bribe case}}&lt;/ref&gt;).  The US payment included $450 million in fines and penalties and a forfeiture of $350 million in profits.&lt;ref name=WaPo2008/&gt;  The company was also obligated to spend $1 billion on setting up and funding new internal compliance regimens.&lt;ref name=NYThow/&gt;   Siemens pleaded guilty to violating accounting provisions of the [[Foreign Corrupt Practices Act]]; the parent company did not plead guilty to paying bribes (although its Bangladesh and Venezuela subsidiaries did&lt;ref name=WaPo2008/&gt;); such a guilty plea would have barred Siemens from contracting for the US government.&lt;ref name=NYThow/&gt;  As the scandal had started breaking, Siemens had fired its chairman and CEO [[Heinrich von Pierer]], and had hired its first non-German CEO. Peter Löscher; it also had appointed a US lawyer, Peter Solmssen as an [[independent director]] to its board, in charge of compliance, and had accepted oversight of [[Theo Waigel]], a former German finance minister, as a "compliance monitor".&lt;ref name=Guardian2008/&gt;  The compliance overhaul eventually entailed hiring around 500 full-time compliance personnel worldwide. Siemens also enacted a series of new anti-corruption compliance policies, including a new anti-corruption handbook, web-based tools for due diligence and compliance, a confidential communications channel for employees to report irregular business practices, and a corporate disciplinary committee to impose appropriate disciplinary measures for substantiated misconduct.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.justice.gov/sites/default/files/criminal-fraud/legacy/2013/05/02/12-12-08siemensvenez-sent.pdf|title=United States of America v.

The culture of bribery was old in Siemens, and led to the 1914 [[Siemens scandal|scandal in Japan]] over bribes paid by both Siemens and [[Vickers]] to Japanese naval authorities to win shipbuilding contracts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Sims| first = Richard| year = 2001 | title = Japanese Political History Since the Meiji Renovation 1868–2000 | publisher = Palgrave Macmillan | page = 113 | isbn = 0-312-23915-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The culture of bribery had further had grown up inside Siemens after World War II as Siemens attempted to rebuild its business by competing in the developing world, where bribery is common.  Until 1999 in Germany, bribes were a tax-deductible business expense, and there were no penalties for bribing foreign officials.  In 1999 the [[OECD Anti-Bribery Convention]] came into effect, to which Germany was a party, and Siemens started to use off-shore accounts and other means of hiding its bribery.

As the investigation opened a midlevel executive in the telecommunications unit, Reinhard Slekaczek, was identified as a key player; Slekaczek quit Siemens in 2005 after the company required him to sign a document saying he had followed law and company policy, and turned state's evidence and led investigators to documents he had saved and to other documents.  He had controlled an annual global bribery budget of $40 to $50 million.  The usual method of bribery was to pay a local insider as a "contractor" who would in turn pass money to government officials; as part of the settlement Siemens disclosed that it had 2,700 such contractors worldwide.  Bribes were generally around 5% of a contract's value but in very corrupt countries they could be as high as 40%.  It paid the highest bribes in China, Russia, Argentina, Israel and Venezuela.&lt;ref name=NYThow/&gt;

Examples of bribery the investigation found included:&lt;ref name=NYThow/&gt;
* $40 million in bribes in Argentina to win a $1 billion contract to make national identity cards. 
* $20 million in Israel for a contract to build power plants
* $16 million in Venezuela for urban rail lines. 
* $14 million In China for medical equipment
* $12.7 million in payments in Nigeria
* $5 million in Bangladesh for mobile phones
* $1.7 million in Iraq to Saddam Hussein and others.

The investigation led directly to several prosecutions while it was unfolding, and led to settlements with other governments and prosecution of Siemens employees and bribe recipients in various countries.

In May 2007 a German court convicted two former executives of paying about €6 million in bribes from 1999 to 2002 to help Siemens win [[natural gas]] [[Gas turbine|turbine]] supply contracts with [[Enel]], an Italian energy company. The contracts were valued at about €450 million. Siemens was fined €38 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url = https://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/15/business/worldbusiness/15siemens.html|title =The New York Times | accessdate= 15 May 2007 | date=15 May 2007 | first=G.

In July 2009, Siemens settled allegations of fraud by a Russian affiliate in a [[World Bank]]-funded mass transit project in Moscow by agreeing to not bid on World Bank projects for two years, not allowing the Russian affiliate to do any World Bank funded work for four years, and setting up a $100 million fund at the World Bank to fund anti-corruption activities over 15 years, over which the World Bank had veto and audit rights; this fund became the "“Siemens Integrity Initiative”.&lt;ref name=cold&gt;{{cite book|last1=Oduor|first1=Jacinta Anyango|last2=Fernando|first2=Francisca M.

In 2014, Siemens plans to build a $264 million facility for making offshore wind turbines in Paull, England, as Britain's wind power rapidly expands. Siemens chose the Hull area on the east coast of England because it is close to other large offshore projects planned in coming years. The new plant is expected to begin producing turbine rotor blades in 2016. The plant and the associated service center, in [[Green Port Hull]] nearby, will employ about 1,000 workers. The facilities will serve the UK market, where the electricity that major power producers generate from wind grew by about 38 percent in 2013, representing about 6 percent of total electricity, according to government figures.

Siemens offers a wide range of electrical engineering- and electronics-related products and services.&lt;ref name=reutprof&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/finance/stocks/companyProfile?symbol=SI|title=Profile: Siemens AG|accessdate=3 September 2012|publisher=Reuters}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its products can be broadly divided into the following categories: buildings-related products; drives, automation and industrial plant-related products; energy-related products; lighting; medical products; and transportation and logistics-related products.&lt;ref name=reutprof/&gt;

Siemens buildings-related products include building-automation equipment and systems; building-operations equipment and systems; building fire-safety equipment and systems; building-security equipment and systems; and low-voltage switchgear including circuit protection and distribution products.&lt;ref name=reutprof/&gt;

Siemens drives, automation and industrial plant-related products include motors and drives for conveyor belts; pumps and compressors; heavy duty motors and drives for rolling steel mills; compressors for oil and gas pipelines; mechanical components including gears for wind turbines and cement mills; automation equipment and systems and controls for production machinery and machine tools; and industrial plant for water processing and raw material processing.&lt;ref name=reutprof/&gt;

Siemens energy-related products include gas and steam turbines; generators; compressors; on- and offshore wind turbines; high-voltage transmission products; power transformers; high-voltage switching products and systems; alternating and direct current transmission systems; medium-voltage components and systems; and power automation products.&lt;ref name=reutprof/&gt;

Siemens is a player in the renewable energy industry, the company provides a comprehensive portfolio of products, solutions, and services to help build and operate microgrids of any size. Siemens provide generation and distribution of electrical energy as well as monitoring and controlling of microgrids.&lt;ref name ="Siemens"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Siemens |title=About Siemens |url=https://www.siemens.com/global/en/home/company/about.html |website=www.siemens.com |accessdate=8 October 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; By using primarily renewable energy, microgrids reduce carbon-dioxide emissions, which is often required by government regulations. That makes Siemens especially attractive for campuses, utilities, and islands. Ventotene Island in Italy demonstrates the benefits of a microgrid in terms of sustainability. The Italian energy utility Enel Produzione SPA had a clear goal for the island of Ventotene: a stable power supply system that would operate more sustainably, economically, and reliably. And Siemens had the complete solution: The SIESTORAGE storage system, optimally combined with the Microgrid Controller. This approach included the integration of renewable energy sources to reduce the supply of diesel and to create greater sustainability. An additional goal was to perfectly coordinate all existing and new power components and, even more important, to respond quickly and reliably to grid fluctuations, ultimately guaranteeing a stable network.&lt;ref name="Siemens"/&gt;

Siemens [[OSRAM]] subsidiary produces lighting products including incandescent, halogen, compact fluorescent, fluorescent, high-intensity discharge and Xenon lamps; opto-electronic semiconductor light sources such as light emitting diodes (LEDs), organic LEDs, high power laser diodes, LED systems and LED luminaires; electronic equipment including electronic ballasts; lighting control and management systems; and related precision components.&lt;ref name=reutprof/&gt;

Siemens medical products include clinical information technology systems; hearing instruments; in-vitro diagnostics equipment; imaging equipment including angiography, computed tomography, fluoroscopy, magnetic resonance, mammography, molecular imaging ultrasound, and x-ray equipment; and radiation oncology and particle therapy equipment.&lt;ref name=reutprof/&gt;  {{As of|2015}}, Siemens finalized the sale of its hearing-aid (hearing instruments) business to Sivantos.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://online.wsj.com/articles/siemens-in-talks-to-sell-hearing-aid-business-1413920934 | title=Siemens In Talks To Sell Hearing-Aid Business | work=[[The Wall Street Journal]] | date=22 October 2014&lt;!--might be a couple of days off--&gt; | author=Henning, Eyk | author2=Alessi, Christopher | department=European Business News }}{{closed access}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sivantos.[https://www.sivantos.com/en/press/2015/01/15/siemens-audiology-business-is-now-sivantos/ "Siemens Audiology business is now Sivantos"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303201902/https://www.sivantos.com/en/press/2015/01/15/siemens-audiology-business-is-now-sivantos/ |date=3 March 2016 }}, Sivantos Website, 16 January 2015.

The '''Society of Wood Engravers''' was founded in 1920 by the artists [[Noel Rooke]] and [[Robert Gibbings]], who were the driving force behind the society, and [[Edward Gordon Craig]], [[E.M.O'R. Dickey]], [[Eric Gill]], [[Philip Hagreen]], [[Sydney Lee (engraver)|Sydney Lee]], [[John Nash (artist)|John Nash]], [[Lucien Pissarro]], and [[Gwen Raverat]].&lt;ref name=Selborne&gt; Joanna Selborne, ‘The Society of Wood Engravers: the early years’ in ''Craft History 1'' (1988), published by Combined Arts.&lt;/ref&gt; The aim of the society has been to promote original white line [[wood engraving]]s, designed and engraved by the artist, as opposed to the wood engravings of the nineteenth century, where skilled craftsmen engraved the design of the artist. The impetus behind this new philosophy was Rooke.   

The Society went into abeyance during the 1960s, but was revived in 1984 by [[Hilary Paynter]]. It publishes a bulletin called ''Multiples''.

The Annual Exhibition of the Society tours the UK. In November and December 2017, the 80th Annual Exhibition is being held in [[Petworth]], West Sussex.

Notable former Members include:

* [[Robert Gibbings]]
* [[Eric Gill]]

'''Solar Power International''' is a solar power conference, in 2008 was touted as the largest solar power conference in North America.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=Jennifer | last=Runyon | coauthors= |authorlink= | title=Solar Power International Kicks Off with a Bang | date=2008-10-14 | publisher=RenewableEnergyWorld.com | url =http://www.renewableenergyworld.com/rea/news/article/2008/10/solar-power-international-kicks-off-with-a-bang-53808 | work =www.renewableenergyworld.com | pages = | accessdate = 2009-02-25 | language = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The conference was previously called Solar Power Conference and Expo, and was created in 2004 when the [[Solar Electric Power Association]] (SEPA) and the [[Solar Energy Industries Association]] (SEIA) joined together to organize an annual event to bring together companies and professionals from all parts of the solar industry. The conference consists of two main elements: an exhibition hall where companies have booths to promote their products and services; and conference sessions where panels of solar industry experts share ideas and success stories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zerofootprint.net/green-world/events/12737 |title=Green World: Events |accessdate=2009-02-25 |year=2008 |work=www.zerofootprint.net |publisher=Zerofootprint Inc. }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Solar Power International 2010 was held at the Los Angeles Convention Center
October 12–14. The 2013 Conference was held on Oct 21-24 in Chicago, Ill at McCormick Place Convention Center and the 2014 Conference will be held on Oct 20-23 at the Las Vegas Convention Center in Las Vegas, Nevada

==Attendees==
Solar Power International is attended by professionals in the solar industry who are builders, project developers, installers, distributors, engineering firms, investors and financiers, service providers, law firms, equipment manufacturers, and manufacturers of tools for equipment manufacturing.  Representatives from utilities also attend the conference as well as Government representatives, policymakers, and the press.

Members of the Solar Energy Industries Association and the Solar Electric Power Association receive discounts on registration.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.solarpowerinternational.com/attend/register/&lt;/ref&gt;

The majority of attendees of Solar Power International come from the [[United States]], however there are a large number of attendees from major solar markets such as China, Japan, and Germany.
==Conference Sessions==
The conference sessions at Solar Power International are traditionally separated by topic into different tracks. Typical tracks are technical, marketing &amp; sales, market conditions, finance, and politics. There are generally over 70 sessions over the four-day conference.

SoTerML development is being done within The [http://www.esoter.org e-SoTer] Platform. [[GEOSS]] plans a global Earth Observation System and, within this framework, the e-SOTER project addresses the felt need for a global soil and terrain database.
The Centre for Geospatial Science (Currently Nottingham Gepospatial Institute) at [[the University of Nottingham]] has initiated the development since January 2009. Further development and maintenance is currently handled in National Soil Resources Institurte (NSRI) at [[Cranfield University]], UK. The role of CGS is within the development of the e-SOTER dissemination platform, which is based on [[INSPIRE]] principles. The SoTerML development included:

1. Development of a [[data dictionary]] for nomenclatures and various data sources (data and metadata).

2. Development of an exchange format/procedures from the [[World Reference Base]] 2006.

'''Steam springs''' or '''steam suspension''' are a form of [[suspension (vehicle)|suspension]] used for some [[early steam locomotives]] designed and built by [[George Stephenson]]. They were only briefly used and may have been used for fewer than ten locomotives.

== Requirements for suspension ==
[[File:Chpr rail.jpg|thumb|[[Cast-iron]] [[fishbelly rail]]
|alt=A line of cast-iron fishbelly rail sections, each a yard long, between stone block sleepers]]
Early railways used [[cast-iron]] [[fishbelly rail]]s. These were [[brittle]] and prone to cracking under shock loads. The new steam locomotives of the 1820s were much heavier than the horse-drawn wagons of earlier [[plateway]]s. Locomotives of this period also used vertical cylinders set within the boiler. The vertical forces of the moving pistons further gave rise to [[hammer blow]], which increased the load on the rails.

A further reason for suspension was to improve the frictional contact between the wheels and rail. This relied upon maintaining a good contact, thus requiring good suspension of the wheels over the uneven track.&lt;ref &gt;{{Cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ability of an 'adhesion-hauled' locomotive to draw a train was much questioned at this time, as it was thought that the friction between a smooth iron wheel and the rail would be inadequate. Some designers, such as [[John Blenkinsop|Blenkinsop]] with his ''[[Salamanca (locomotive)|Salamanca]]'' thought that a system of geared teeth would be necessary. Stephenson believed that, provided a good contact could be maintained between wheel and rail, frictional adhesion alone would be adequate.

At the time of these early locomotives there was not yet a way of forging an adequate steel spring to carry the weight of a locomotive. High quality steel had been available since [[Benjamin Huntsman|Huntsman]]'s [[crucible steel|crucible process]], but it was still so expensive as to be regarded as 'a semi-precious metal'.&lt;ref name="Jones, 16" /&gt; It would be another forty years before [[Bessemer process|Bessemer's converter]] made cheap bulk steel available. A similar problem affected [[safety valve]]s, causing them to rely on dead weights or [[Timothy Hackworth|Hackworth]]'s bulky [[Safety valve#Direct spring valves|stack of leaf springs]],&lt;ref name="Hackworth spring safety valve, 1830" &gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; rather than the ubiquitous steel [[coil spring]] that would appear later.

Stephenson's 'steam suspension' provided each wheel with its own 'steam spring'. Vertical cylinders were set into the base of the boiler, above each axle and offset in pairs to the sides. The chassis or frames of Stephenson's locomotives provided little structural strength, most of which came from the shell of the [[flued boiler|boiler]]. Inside each cylinder a piston carried the load of the axle and pressed upwards against steam pressure within the boiler.{{sfnp|Thurston|1878| page=187 }} A piston of only a few inches in diameter was sufficient to balance the locomotive's weight. The axlebox bearings could slide vertically within hornblocks attached to the wooden frame beneath the boiler.

[[Piston#Steam engines|Piston]] seals were a perennial problem at this time. Those for large stationary engines, working at low pressures, were sealed by a variety of methods including leather cup washers, pools of standing water and even a poultice of cow dung. As working pressures increased, which had been an essential part of turning the [[stationary steam engine]] into the mobile [[steam locomotive]], demands on the piston seal increased further. Pistons were now mostly sealed by having [[oakum]] rope wrapped around them in a groove, often smeared with [[tallow]]. Keeping the rope seal moist, thus swollen, was recognised as an important factor in achieving a good seal. As the steam spring cylinders were in the lower part of the boiler, below the water line, it was expected that they would seal well. Despite this, they continued to give trouble with leakage and were eventually removed and replaced with iron or steel leaf springs.&lt;ref name="LB, George Stephenson" /&gt; [[Nicholas Wood|Wood]] in 1831 illustrates one of the Killingworth locomotives, now fitted with metal leaf springs and also [[coupling rod]]s.&lt;ref &gt;{{cite book

=== Killingworth Colliery locomotives ===
George Stephenson's first locomotive was the [[Blücher (locomotive)|''Blücher'']] of 1814.{{sfnp|Thurston|1878| page=187 }}{{efn-lr|Recent scholarship holds that Stephenson's ''My Lord'' of 1814 pre-dated ''Blücher''&lt;ref name="Bailey, Stephenson" /&gt;}} This was a four-wheeled locomotive with the wheels coupled by [[spur gear]]s. It suffered from poor traction on the relatively new technology of [[edge rail]]s with flanged wheels, put down to the problem of maintaining a good contact with them. It was the first of a batch of early Stephenson locomotives known as the '[[Killingworth locomotives|Killingworth Colliery locomotives]]'.{{efn-lr|It is uncertain just when the various Killingworth locomotives were built and details of their various designs are mis-reported.}} Stephenson's next design was a development of this, still with four wheels, but now using a [[chain drive]] to couple them together.&lt;ref &gt;''Stephenson's Killingworth locomotive, 1815'', engraving of 1829, unknown author, in {{Cite book
  |year=1958

}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was his first locomotive to use steam springs.&lt;ref name="Strickland, 1826" &gt;{{Cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''The Duke'' ===
Stephenson had gained a reputation as a builder of locomotives and was approached to build the first locomotive for use in Scotland, on the [[Kilmarnock and Troon Railway]]. ''The Duke'' was larger, with six wheels, and used the same chain drive and steam springs as the Killingworth locomotives. As this locomotive was to be built for an outside customer, Stephenson could no longer use the workshop facilities at Killingworth and so it was built at his friend [[William Losh]]'s [[Losh, Wilson and Bell|Walker Iron Works]] in [[Walker, Newcastle upon Tyne|Newcastle]].&lt;ref name="LB, George Stephenson" /&gt; Improvements of this locomotive were detailed in a patent, jointly filed with Losh, on 30 September 1816.

''The Duke'' was probably completed in 1817&lt;ref name=brotchie &gt;{{Cite book
  |pages=49 - 53

}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ran at Kilmarnock, but seems to have continued the problems of rail breakage. It was sold to [[Thomas Bruce, 7th Earl of Elgin|the Earl of Elgin]] in October 1824 for his railway in [[Fife]], but being too heavy for the rails was used as a stationary pumping engine in a quarry at [[Charlestown, Fife|Charlestown]], and from 1830 at a colliery near [[Dunfermline]]; its subsequent fate is unrecorded.  

Most Scottish depictions of ''The Duke'' are inaccurate, being based on the Killingworth locomotives or even [[Stephenson's Rocket|Stephenson's ''Rocket'']], but in 1914 a commemorative silver model was made for the centenary and this alone seems accurate, showing the six wheels and the cylinders of the steam springs.&lt;ref name="Troon" &gt;{{Cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Hetton Colliery locomotives ===
Five locomotives were built for [[Hetton colliery railway|Hetton Colliery]] between 1820 and 1822, four of which were named: ''Hettton'', ''Dart'', ''Tallyho'' and ''Star''.&lt;ref name="LB, George Stephenson" /&gt;{{sfnp|Thurston|1878| page=190 }} These were of similar design to ''The Duke'', but four-wheeled with 3' 9" wheels. They were built with steam springs, later removed owing to problems with steam leakage.&lt;ref name="LB, George Stephenson" /&gt;

In 1852, [[Lyons, Hetton colliery railway|''Lyon'']] was built as a replica of these early Hetton locomotives.

=== Later locomotives and ''Locomotion'' ===
[[File:Locomotion Tyseley.jpg|thumb|''Locomotion'' (replica), with coupling rods and Hackworth two-part disc wheels
|alt=A modern replica of Locomotion, showing the features it introduced of external coupling rods and Hackworth's stronger two-piece disc wheels]]
Later locomotives abandoned the steam springs. For [[Locomotion No. 1|''Locomotion'']] on the [[Stockton and Darlington Railway]] in 1825 there was no springing provided. Although there were no springs, side-to-side compensation was provided to keep good contact between rails and wheels. One of the axles was carried in a [[cannon bearing|'cannon box' bearing]] that was pivoted centrally and could tilt from side to side.{{sfnp|Bailey|2014| page=35–36 }} Although not giving a stable ride for the locomotive, it did allow the wheels to follow uneven track. The presence of this cannon box between the wheels also prevented the previous use of the central drive chain and so Stephenson adopted the now ubiquitous [[coupling rod]]s for his first time. Reducing the travel of the suspension, compared to that with steam springs, also made the provision of free-running coupling rods easier, as it avoided the change in effective wheelbase when one axle moved relative to the other.

The unsprung ride broke the original eight-spoked cast-iron wheels and so these were replaced by Hackworth with his distinctive [[Hackworth plug wheel|two piece cast-iron disc wheel]]s, trued by wooden wedges between the concentric parts.{{sfnp|Bailey|2014| page=35–36 }} Rail breakage had been reduced by this time with the use of stronger rails. These new malleable [[wrought iron]] rails had been the source of a rift between Stephenson and Losh, as Losh had originally expected to supply cast-iron rails from his ironworks, which Stephenson had briefly been a partner in. Stephenson though chose to use an improved iron rail from [[John Birkinshaw]]'s [[Bedlington Ironworks]] instead.

The idea of a particle underwent serious rethinking when experiments showed that light could behave like a stream of particles (called [[photon]]s) as well as exhibiting wave-like properties. This led to the new concept of [[wave–particle duality]] to reflect that quantum-scale "particles" behave like both particles and waves (they are sometimes described as [[Wave–particle duality|wavicles]] to reflect this). Another new concept, the [[uncertainty principle]], states that some of their properties taken together, such as their simultaneous [[position (vector)|position]] and [[momentum]], cannot be measured exactly.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |first=W. |last=Heisenberg |title=Über den anschaulichen Inhalt der quantentheoretischen Kinematik und Mechanik  |language=de|journal=[[Zeitschrift für Physik]] |volume=43 |issue=3–4 |date=1927 |pages=172–198 |doi=10.1007/BF01397280 |postscript=. |bibcode = 1927ZPhy...43..172H }}&lt;/ref&gt; In more recent times, wave–particle duality has been shown to apply not only to photons but to increasingly massive particles as well.&lt;ref&gt;

Interactions of particles in the framework of [[quantum field theory]] are understood as creation and annihilation of ''[[quantum|quanta]]'' of corresponding [[fundamental interaction]]s. This blends particle physics with [[Quantum field theory|field theory]].

==Classification==

===By statistics===
{{main|Spin–statistics theorem}}
[[File:Standard Model of Elementary Particles.svg|thumb|392x392px|The [[Standard Model]] classification of particles]]
Any subatomic particle, like any particle in the three-dimensional [[space]] that obeys the laws of [[quantum mechanics]], can be either a [[boson]] (with integer [[spin (physics)|spin]]) or a [[fermion]] (with odd half-integer spin).

===By composition===
The elementary particles of the [[Standard Model]] include:&lt;ref name=IntroSM1&gt;

* Six "[[Flavour (particle physics)|flavors]]" of [[quark]]s: [[Up quark|up]], [[Down quark|down]], [[Bottom quark|bottom]], [[Top quark|top]], [[Strange quark|strange]], and [[Charm quark|charm]];
* Six types of [[lepton]]s: [[electron]], [[electron neutrino]], [[muon]], [[muon neutrino]], [[tau (particle)|tau]], [[tau neutrino]];
* Twelve [[gauge boson]]s (force carriers): the [[photon]] of [[electromagnetism]], the three [[W and Z bosons]] of the [[weak interaction|weak force]], and the eight [[gluon]]s of the [[strong force]];
* The [[Higgs boson]].
Various [[Physics beyond the Standard Model|extensions of the Standard Model]] predict the existence of an elementary [[graviton]] particle and [[List of elementary particles#Hypothetical particles|many other elementary particles]].

Composite subatomic particles (such as [[proton]]s or atomic [[Atomic nucleus|nuclei]]) are [[bound state]]s of two or more [[elementary particle]]s. For example, a proton is made of two [[up quark]]s and one [[down quark]], while the atomic nucleus of [[helium-4]] is composed of two protons and two [[neutron]]s. The neutron is made of two down quarks and one up quark. Composite particles include all [[hadron]]s: these include [[baryon]]s (such as [[proton]]s and [[neutron]]s) and [[meson]]s (such as [[pion]]s and [[kaon]]s).

===By mass===
In [[special relativity]], the [[Mass–energy equivalence|energy of a particle at rest equals its mass times the speed of light squared]], {{nowrap begin}}''E'' = ''mc''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;{{nowrap end}}. That is, [[mass]] can be expressed in terms of [[energy]] and vice versa. If a particle has a [[frame of reference]] in which it lies [[rest (physics)|at rest]], then it has a positive [[rest mass]] and is referred to as ''massive''.

All composite particles are massive. Baryons (meaning "heavy") tend to have greater mass than mesons (meaning "intermediate"), which in turn tend to be heavier than leptons (meaning "lightweight"), but the heaviest lepton (the [[tau particle]]) is heavier than the two lightest flavours of baryons ([[nucleon]]s). It is also certain that any particle with an [[electric charge]] is massive.

All [[massless particle]]s (particles whose [[invariant mass]] is zero) are elementary. These include the photon and gluon, although the latter cannot be isolated.

==Other properties==

Through the work of [[Albert Einstein]], [[Satyendra Nath Bose]], [[Louis de Broglie]], and many others, current scientific theory holds that ''all'' particles also have a wave nature.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; This has been verified not only for elementary particles but also for compound particles like atoms and even molecules. In fact, according to traditional formulations of non-relativistic quantum mechanics, wave–particle duality applies to all objects, even macroscopic ones; although the wave properties of macroscopic objects cannot be detected due to their small wavelengths.&lt;ref&gt;

 |quote=For both large and small wavelengths, both matter and radiation have both particle and wave aspects. [...] But the wave aspects of their motion become more difficult to observe as their wavelengths become shorter. [...] For ordinary macroscopic particles the mass is so large that the momentum is always sufficiently large to make the de Broglie wavelength small enough to be beyond the range of experimental detection, and classical mechanics reigns supreme.
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Interactions between particles have been scrutinized for many centuries, and a few simple laws underpin how particles behave in collisions and interactions. The most fundamental of these are the laws of [[conservation of energy]] and [[conservation of momentum]], which let us make calculations of particle interactions on scales of magnitude that range from stars to [[quark]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[[Isaac Newton]] (1687). [[Newton's Laws of Motion]] (''[[Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica]]'')&lt;/ref&gt; These are the prerequisite basics of [[Newtonian mechanics]], a series of statements and equations in ''[[Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica]]'', originally published in 1687.

==Dividing an atom==
The negatively charged electron has a mass equal to {{frac|1837 or 1836}} of that of a [[hydrogen]] atom. The remainder of the hydrogen atom's mass comes from the positively charged [[proton]]. The [[atomic number]] of an element is the number of protons in its nucleus. Neutrons are neutral particles having a mass slightly greater than that of the proton. Different [[isotope]]s of the same element contain the same number of protons but differing numbers of neutrons. The [[mass number]] of an isotope is the total number of [[nucleon]]s (neutrons and protons collectively).

[[Chemistry]] concerns itself with how electron sharing binds atoms into structures such as crystals and [[molecule]]s. [[Nuclear physics]] deals with how protons and neutrons arrange themselves in nuclei. The study of subatomic particles, atoms and molecules, and their structure and interactions, requires [[quantum mechanics]]. Analyzing processes that change the numbers and types of particles requires [[quantum field theory]]. The study of subatomic particles ''per se'' is called [[particle physics]]. The term ''[[high-energy physics]]'' is nearly synonymous to "particle physics" since creation of particles requires high energies: it occurs only as a result of [[cosmic ray]]s, or in [[particle accelerator]]s. [[phenomenology (particle physics)|Particle phenomenology]] systematizes the knowledge about subatomic particles obtained from these experiments.&lt;ref&gt;Taiebyzadeh, Payam (2017). String Theory; A unified theory and inner dimension of elementary particles (BazDahm). Riverside, Iran: Shamloo Publications Center. {{ISBN|978-600-116-684-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{main|History of subatomic physics|Timeline of particle discoveries}}
The term "''subatomic'' particle" is largely a [[retronym]] of the 1960s, used to distinguish a large number of [[baryon]]s and [[meson]]s (which comprise [[hadron]]s) from particles that are now thought to be [[elementary particle|truly elementary]]. Before that hadrons were usually classified as "elementary" because their composition was unknown.

'''Tata OneCAT''' (Compressed Air Technology) was advertised as an upcoming [[compressed air car]] in 2008. [[India]]'s [[Tata Motors]] was said to be collaborating with Air engine developer [[Guy Nègre]] of [[Motor Development International|MDI]] to produce the vehicle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dancewithshadows.com/autoindia/tata-one-cat.asp |title=Tata OneCAT, compressed air car at Rs 2 lakh price, Tata OneCat photo, picture gallery |publisher=Dancewithshadows.com |date=2008-02-19 |accessdate=2010-02-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100211071743/http://www.dancewithshadows.com/autoindia/tata-one-cat.asp |archivedate=2010-02-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The vehicle contains air tanks that can be filled in four hours by plugging the car into a standard electrical plug. MDI also plans to design a gas station compressor, which would fill the tanks in three minutes.&lt;ref Name="Harrabin"&gt;{{cite news |last=Harrabin |first=Roger |title=Five-seat concept car runs on air |work=An engineer has promised that within a year he will start selling a car that runs on compressed air, producing no emissions at all in town. |publisher=BBC News |date=13 February 2008 |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/7241909.stm |accessdate=2008-02-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The OneCAT is a five-seat vehicle with a 200&amp;nbsp;litre trunk.&lt;ref&gt;Note: All the figures are from MDI and are not independently verified&lt;/ref&gt; There is no reliable data on range and top speed for this prototype available.

As of August 2009 there was no mentioning of the prototype or planned production of the TATA OneCAT on the TATA or MDI homepages. In December 2009 Tata's vice president of engineering systems confirmed that the limited range and low engine temperatures were causing difficulties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dnaindia.com/money/report_tamo-s-ambitious-air-car-faces-starting-trouble_1316093 |title=TaMo's ambitious 'Air Car' faces starting trouble |publisher=dnaindia.com |date=2009-11-25 |accessdate=2010-02-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100507095634/http://www.dnaindia.com/money/report_tamo-s-ambitious-air-car-faces-starting-trouble_1316093 |archivedate=2010-05-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  
Meanwhile, all links, articles and archives relative to MDI have disappeared from Tata's website.

In February, 2012 Tata released information that their compressed-air vehicle would debut in  August, 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mcgeeks.com/8k-compressed-air-cars-shipping-in-august-in-india |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-03-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120309054436/http://www.mcgeeks.com/8k-compressed-air-cars-shipping-in-august-in-india |archivedate=2012-03-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The White Lady''' is an unusual standing stone, said to resemble a figure, located near the small fishing village of [[Dunmore East]],in [[County Waterford]], [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]].

The standing stone is situated in open farmland overlooking the sea, between the small coves of Rathmoylan and Ballymacaw.

It is believed that the name ''White Lady'' is due to the standing stone having been whitewashed, or possibly painted white, at some point, although no traces of this remain. The purpose of the stone is not fully understood, it may have been erected as a marker to guide local fishermen, or it could have been an ancient symbolic or religious monument.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.prehistoricwaterford.com/products/ballymacaw-the-white-lady/ |title=Ballymacaw - The White Lady|publisher=prehistoricwaterford.com |date= |accessdate=2012-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Toyota iQ''' is a [[transverse engine]]d, front-wheel-drive [[city car]] that was manufactured by [[Toyota]] and marketed in a single generation for Japan (2008–2016), Europe (2008–2015), and North America (2012–2015) where it was marketed as the '''Scion iQ.'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://green.autoblog.com/2011/07/20/2012-scion-iq-priced-from-15-995/ | title = 2012 Scion iQ priced from $15,995 | author = Eric Loveday | publisher = [[AutoblogGreen]] | date = 2011-07-20 | accessdate = 2011-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Cain | first = Timothy | title = 2012 release for the Scion iQ in Canada | url = http://www.goodcarbadcar.net/2011/07/2012-scion-iq-price-canada-16760.html | work = Auto sales data and news | accessdate = 2013-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[badge engineering|rebadged variant]] was marketed in Europe as the '''Aston Martin Cygnet''' (2009–2013).

Designed at the [[Toyota European Design and Development]] studio in [[Nice]], France, the iQ is noted for its specialized engineering to maximize passenger space, while minimizing exterior length. The design accommodates three passengers—and provisionally a fourth, under very tight conditions.

Following a concept presented at the [[Frankfurt Auto Show#2007|2007 Frankfurt Auto Show]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Abuelsamid | first = Sam | url = http://www.autobloggreen.com/2007/09/12/frankfurt-2007-toyota-iq-concept-details-and-pics/ | title = Frankfurt 2007: Toyota iQ concept details and Pics | publisher = Autobloggreen.com | date = 2007-09-12 | accessdate = 2009-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; the production iQ debuted at the March 2008 [[Geneva Motor Show#2008|Geneva Motor Show]]. Japanese sales began in November 2008 and European sales in January 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.leftlanenews.com/toyota-iq.html | title = 2009 Toyota iQ revealed (updated) | publisher = Leftlanenews.com | accessdate = 2009-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, the iQ was named the Japanese [[Car of the Year Japan|Car of the Year]]. The name ''iQ'', an [[Acronym and initialism|initialism]] of the term [[intelligence quotient]], recalls a competitor, the [[Smart Fortwo]]. The letters "iQ" also stand for "individuality", "innovation", "quality", a hint at its "cubic form" and also a "cue" for owners to embrace new types of vehicles and lifestyles.

The iQ reached the end of production in December 2015, and it was discontinued in Japan on 4 April 2016.

==Overview==
[[File:Toyota iQ 02.JPG|thumb|left|Toyota iQ (Japan)]]

The IQ design emphasizes low fuel consumption, maneuverability, environmental friendliness, and maximized interior space. Six specific design factors contribute to IQ's minimal overhangs, forward windscreen location, maximized cabin space and overall compactness:
* A newly developed differential mounted further forward than usual
* A centre take-off steering gear
* A flat fuel tank positioned underneath the cabin floor
* Rear-angled shock absorbers to encroach less on rear passenger space
* A smaller heater/air conditioning unit mounted centrally behind the asymmetric dashboard
* A slimmer seat design.

The iQ features a transmissions differential housing located ahead of, rather than behind, the engine; a starter motor incorporated in the engine's flywheel, a high-mounted steering rack and a compact, high-located air conditioning unit behind the dashboard central area. The arrangement allows the front passenger to sit forward of the driver, giving increased rear passenger legroom. A shallow under-floor fuel tank reduces rear overhang.&lt;ref name="ref5"&gt;{{cite news | title = 2010 Toyota iQ | publisher = Car and Driver, Ray Hutton, December 2008 | url = http://www.caranddriver.com/reviews/2010-toyota-iq-first-drive-review}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of its overall width and engine displacement, the iQ is classified in its home market as a [[supermini]], though its length complies with ''[[kei car]]'' [[Vehicle size class#Japan|dimensional regulations]].

Production of the Scion iQ EV (Toyota eQ in Japan) was to be limited to 100 units for special fleet use in Japan and [[carsharing]] demonstration projects in the U.S.&lt;ref name=WP0912/&gt;&lt;ref name=UCIrvine/&gt; Deliveries of the [[all-electric car|all-electric]] version with a range of {{convert|80|km|mi|abbr=on}} began in the U.S. in March 2013.

===Specifications===
[[File:Toyota eQ in Japan EV Festival 2012.jpg|thumb|Toyota eQ electric city car]]

Designed as a city commuting vehicle, the iQ EV has a lower battery capacity that also translates into a shorter charging time, allowing the car to be fully recharged in approximately three hours, and using fast charging, the battery can be recharged up to 80% capacity in only 15 minutes. The iQ EV has a 150 cell 12 [[kWh]] 277.5 V [[lithium-ion battery]] pack that delivers a NEDC-certified [[all-electric range|range]] of {{convert|85|km|mi|abbr=on}},&lt;ref name=ProdiQEV/&gt; and rated {{convert|80|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} in the U.S.&lt;ref name=UCIrvine/&gt; Based on further development of Toyota's [[Hybrid Synergy Drive]] technology, the iQ EV's fully electric powertrain comprises an air-cooled, 47&amp;nbsp;kW electric motor/generator, the 12 kWh [[battery pack]], a 3&amp;nbsp;kW water-cooled battery charger, an [[inverter]], a DC/DC converter and a motor speed reduction mechanism. Maximum torque of {{Convert|163|Nm|lbft|0|abbr=on}} is delivered to the front wheels, giving the iQ EV 0–100 km/h (62 mph) acceleration of 14.0 seconds and a maximum speed of {{convert|125|kph|abbr=on}}. Like other Toyota full hybrid vehicles, the iQ EV is equipped with a [[regenerative braking]] system.&lt;ref name=ProdiQEV/&gt;

The iQ EV has a minimum turning radius of just {{convert|4.1|m|ft|abbr=on}} and with a length of {{convert|3120|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}, making the iQ EV {{convert|135|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} longer than a standard iQ. The electric car shares the iQ overall width of {{convert|1680|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}, height of {{convert|1505|mm|in|abbr=on}} and wheelbase of {{convert|2000|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}. High tensile sheet steel has been extensively used in the body shell construction to minimize the additional weight caused by the lithium-ion battery pack, and as a result, the iQ EV weighs just {{convert|125|kg|lb|abbr=on}} more than a standard 1.3L CVT iQ.&lt;ref name=ProdiQEV/&gt;

===Fuel economy===
The [[U. S. Environmental Protection Agency]] rated the 2013 iQ EV with a combined [[fuel economy in automobiles|fuel economy]] of 121 [[miles per gallon gasoline equivalent]] (MPG-e) ({{convert|121|mpgus|L/100 km|abbr=on|disp=out|1}}) with an energy consumption of 28&amp;nbsp;kW-hrs/100 miles. The city rating is 138 MPG-e ({{convert|138|mpgus|L/100 km|abbr=on|disp=out|1}}) with an energy consumption of 24&amp;nbsp;kW-hrs/100 miles and 105 MPG-e ({{convert|105|mpgus|L/100 km|abbr=on|disp=out|1}}) with an energy consumption of 32&amp;nbsp;kW-hrs/100 miles for highway driving.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.fueleconomy.gov/feg/Find.do?action=sbs&amp;id=33307 | title = 2013 Scion iQ EV | publisher = fueleconomy.gov | date = 2012-11-30 | accessdate = 2012-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{As of|2014|12}}, these ratings allow the 2013 iQ EV to be the second most fuel efficient EPA-certified vehicle of all fuel types considered in all years behind the BMW i3.&lt;ref name=EPAMost&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.fueleconomy.gov/feg/extremeMPG.jsp | title = Most Efficient EPA-Certified Vehicles- Current Model Year | publisher = fueleconomy.gov | year = 2012 | accessdate = 2012-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.fueleconomy.gov/feg/PowerSearch.do?action=PowerSearch&amp;year1=1984&amp;year2=2015&amp;rdomsrp01=85000_0&amp;minmsrpsel=0&amp;maxmsrpsel=0&amp;cbvtelectric=Electric&amp;city=0&amp;combined=0&amp;highway=0&amp;mpgType=0&amp;minMPGSel=&amp;maxMPGSel=&amp;YearSel=1984-2015&amp;MakeSel=&amp;MarClassSel=&amp;FuelTypeSel=&amp;VehTypeSel=Electric&amp;TranySel=&amp;DriveTypeSel=&amp;CylindersSel=&amp;MpgSel=000&amp;sortBy=Comb&amp;Units=&amp;url=SearchServlet&amp;opt=new&amp;minmsrp=0&amp;maxmsrp=0&amp;minmpg=0&amp;maxmpg=0&amp;rowLimit=10 | title = List of electric vehicles by EPA Fuel Economy | accessdate = 2014-12-06 | publisher = fueleconomy.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; The iQ EV was ranked first in DOE-EPA's 2013 Annual Fuel Economy Guide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.plugincars.com/2013-doe-epa-fuel-economy-guide-includes-14-plug-models-125621.html | title = 2013 DOE-EPA Fuel Economy Guide Includes 14 Plug-in Models | author = Brad Berman | publisher = PluginCars.com | date = 2012-12-07 | accessdate = 2012-12-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Aston Martin Cygnet''' is a [[badge engineering|rebadged]] variant of the Toyota/Scion iQ marketed by [[Aston Martin]] beginning with model year 2011—enabling Aston Martin to comply with the 2012 [[European Union]]-imposed fleet average [[European emission standards|emissions regulations]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://ec.europa.eu/environment/air/transport/co2/co2_home.htm | title = EU 2012 emission rules | work = European Commission | accessdate = 2010-10-14 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20100724003430/http://ec.europa.eu/environment/air/transport/co2/co2_home.htm | archivedate = 2010-07-24 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.topgear.com/uk/car-news/aston-martin-cygnet-toyota-iq-2011-01-20 | title = Aston's iQ to cost £31k – BBC Top Gear | work = Top Gear | date = 2011-01-20 | accessdate = 2012-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Aston Martin Cygnet dashboard.jpg|left|thumb|Aston Martin Cygnet interior]]

The Cygnet was initially only marketed in the UK. Sales commenced in January 2011 and the market coverage was expanded to cover other European countries the following year.&lt;ref name="astonmartin.com"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.astonmartin.com/eng/thecompany/news?a=87baae1a-a4cd-4483-bdc4-86f103dd2931 | title = Aston Martin Cygnet Launch Editions; White and Black | accessdate = 2011-01-22 | publisher = Aston Martin}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sales were not restricted, but demand from existing Aston Martin owners for Cygnet was  expected to take priority initially. Aston Martin CEO [[Ulrich Bez]] announced shipping expectations of about 4000 per year at a price of about £30,000&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.autocar.co.uk/News/NewsArticle/AllCars/247522/ | title = Aston shares to fund new cars | work = [[Autocar (magazine)|Autocar]] | accessdate = 2010-02-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; – about three times as much as the iQ.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.evo.co.uk/news/evonews/262507/aston_martin_cygnet_launch_editions.html | title = Aston Martin Cygnet supermini launch editions | publisher = evo | date = 2011-01-20 | accessdate = 2012-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bez claimed that the Cygnet demonstrated the company's "commitment to innovation and integrity", whilst respecting the need to "satisfy demands of emissions and space".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.autotalk.com/aston-martin-cygnet-confirmed-for-production-6743/ | title = Aston Martin Cygnet Confirmed for Production &amp;#124; Aston Martin at AutoTalk | publisher = Autotalk.com | date = 2010-10-11 | accessdate = 2012-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Cygnet featured revisions to the exterior and interior but shared other specifications with the iQ, having a {{convert|97|bhp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} 1.3L inline-four engine,&lt;ref name="astonmartin.com/cars"&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://www.astonmartin.com/cars/cygnet/specs | title = Specifications | accessdate = 2012-01-05 | work = astonmartin.com/cars}}&lt;/ref&gt; it produced 110 g of {{CO2}}/km and fuel consumption of {{convert|58.9|mpgus|L/100 km mpgimp|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.4wheelsnews.com/aston-martin-cygnet-full-details-and-specs/ | title = Aston Martin Cygnet details | work = 4 Wheels News | accessdate = 2010-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2013, after just over two years of production, Aston Martin announced that it would stop production of their Cygnet city car. The Cygnet has been the second shortest running production car in the history of Aston Martin after the 2012 [[Aston Martin Virage]], which was only produced for a year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://thesupercarkids.com/aston-martin-ends-production-cygnet-city-car | title = Aston Martin Ends Production Cygnet City Car | work = The Supercar Kids | date = 2013-09-27 | accessdate = 2013-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Cygnet was cancelled due to disastrously low sales, with the car reaching only 150 units in the UK&lt;ref name=Beeb&gt;{{cite news | title = Aston Martin to end production of Cygnet small car | url = https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-24455948 | work = BBC News: Business | date = 2013-10-09 | accessdate = 2014-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; (approximately 300 in total{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}) rather than its annual target of 4000.&lt;ref name=Beeb/&gt;

In June 2018 Aston Martin announced a one-off 4.7-litre {{cvt|430|bhp|kW|0|order=flip}} V8 edition for a customer. It uses the engine, transmission, suspension, brakes and wheels from the [[Aston Martin V8 Vantage (2019)|Aston Martin Vantage S]].

'''Undecylenic acid''' is an [[organic compound]] with the formula CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;=CH(CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H. It is an [[Saturated and unsaturated compounds|unsaturated]] [[fatty acid]].  It is a colorless oil. Undecylenic acid is mainly used for the production of [[Nylon-11]] and in the treatment of fungal infections of the skin, but it is also a precursor in the manufacture of many [[pharmaceuticals]], personal hygiene products, [[cosmetics]], and perfumes.&lt;ref name=Ullmann/&gt;  [[Salt (chemistry)|Salts]] and [[ester]]s of undecylenic acid are known as '''undecylenates'''.

==Preparation==
Undecylenic acid is prepared by [[pyrolysis]] of [[ricinoleic acid]], which is derived from [[castor oil]]. Specifically, the [[methyl]] [[ester]] of ricinoleic acid is  [[cracking (chemistry)|cracked]] to yield both undecylenic acid and [[heptanal]].  The process is conducted at 500–600&amp;nbsp;°C in the presence of steam.&lt;ref name=Ullmann&gt;David J. Anneken, Sabine Both, Ralf Christoph, Georg Fieg, Udo Steinberner, Alfred Westfechtel "Fatty Acids" in ''Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry'', 2006, Wiley-VCH, Weinheim. {{DOI|10.1002/14356007.a10_245.pub2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | author = A.

==General commercial uses==
Undecylenic acid is converted to [[11-Aminoundecanoic acid|11-aminoundecanoic acid]] on an industrial scale.  This aminocarboxylic acid is the precursor to Nylon-11.&lt;ref name=Ullmann/&gt;

Undecylenic acid is reduced to undecylene aldehyde, which is valued in perfumery.  The acid is first converted to the [[acid chloride]], which allows selective reduction.&lt;ref&gt;{{Ullmann | author = Christian Kohlpaintner, Markus Schulte, Jürgen Falbe, Peter Lappe, Jürgen Weber | title = Aldehydes, Aliphatic | doi = 10.1002/14356007.a01_321.pub2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Medical uses===
{{medref|date=July 2015}}
Undecylenic acid is an active ingredient in medications for skin infections, and to relieve itching, burning, and irritation associated with skin problems. For example, it is used against [[mycosis|fungal skin infections]], such as [[athlete's foot]], [[ringworm]], [[tinea cruris]],&lt;ref name=fda/&gt; or other generalized infections by ''[[Candida albicans]]''.&lt;ref name="pmid26902505"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Shi|first1=Dongmei|last2=Zhao|first2=Yaxin|last3=Yan|first3=Hongxia|last4=Fu|first4=Hongjun|last5=Shen|first5=Yongnian|last6=Lu|first6=Guixia|last7=Mei|first7=Huan|last8=Qiu|first8=Ying|last9=Li|first9=Dongmei|last10=Liu|first10=Weida|title=Antifungal effects of undecylenic acid on the biofilm formation of Candida albicans|journal=International Journal of Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics|date=1 May 2016|volume=54|issue=05|pages=343–353|doi=10.5414/CP202460 |pmid=26902505}}&lt;/ref&gt; When used for [[tinea cruris]], it can result in extreme burning.{{mcn|date=July 2015}} In some case studies of tinae versicolor, pain and burning result from fungicide application. In a review of placebo-controlled trials, undecenoic acid was deemed efficacious, alongside prescription azoles (e.g., [[clotrimazole]]) and allylamines (e.g., [[terbinafine]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Crawford|first1=F|last2=Hollis|first2=S|title=Topical treatments for fungal infections of the skin and nails of the foot.|journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|date=18 July 2007|issue=3|pages=CD001434|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD001434.pub2|pmid=17636672}}&lt;/ref&gt;).  Undecylenic acid is also a precursor to antidandruff shampoos and antimicrobial powders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=United States International Trade Commission Memorandum | url=http://www.usitc.gov/tata/hts/other/rel_doc/bill_reports/106c/hr-3762.pdf | format=PDF | publisher=USITC | accessdate=2007-01-02 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060924201130/http://www.usitc.gov/tata/hts/other/rel_doc/bill_reports/106c/hr-3762.pdf &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2006-09-24}} - see page 2 of link.{{verify source|date=July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In terms of the mechanism underlying its antifungal effects against ''Candida albicans'', undecylenic acid inhibits morphogenesis. In a study on denture liners, undecylenic acid in the liners was found to inhibit conversion of yeast to the [[hypha| hyphal form]] (which are associated with active infection), via inhibition of fatty acid biosynthesis. The mechanism of action and effectiveness in fatty acid-type antifungals is dependent on the number of carbon atoms in the chain, with efficacy increasing with the number of atoms in the chain.

===U.S. FDA approval===
Undecylenic acid is approved by the U.S. [[Food and Drug Administration|FDA]] for topical route and is listed in the Code of Federal Regulations.&lt;ref name=fda&gt;[https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfcfr/cfrsearch.cfm?cfrpart=333&amp;showfr=1 Publisher FDA] CFR Title 21, Volume 5, Chapter 1, Subchapter D, Part 333, Subpart C, Sec. (§333.210)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research uses==
Undecylenic acid has been used as a linking molecule, because it is a [[bifunctional compound]].  Specifically it is an α,ω- (terminally [[functional group|functionalized]]) bifunctional agent. For instance, the title compound has been used to prepare silicon-based biosensors, linking silicon transducer surfaces to the terminal double bond of undecylenic acid (forming an Si-C bond), leaving the [[carboxylic acid]] groups available for [[Conjugation (biochemistry)|conjugation]] of biomolecules (e.g., proteins).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1021/jp7119922 |author1=A.
