'''Access to Satellite TV for 10,000 African Villages''' is a China-Africa Cooperation project which aims to reduce the [[digital divide]] in African rural areas by giving villages access to [[digital television]].

== History ==
Chinese President [[Xi Jinping]] announced that China would implement satellite TV programs for ten&amp;nbsp;thousand African villages on December 4, 2015 when he was delivering a keynote speech at the opening ceremony of the Johannesburg Summit of the [[Forum on China–Africa Cooperation|Forum on China-Africa Cooperation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://english.cri.cn/12394/2015/12/05/4083s906994.htm|title=President Xi Jinping Delivers Speech at FOCAC Summit: Full Text|last=|first=|date=5 December 2015|website=China Radio International|access-date=1 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The project, known as “Access to Satellite TV for 10,000 African Villages”, is among 10 major cooperation programs to boost cooperation between China and Africa in a period of 3 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.fmprc.gov.cn/mfa_eng/wjdt_665385/2649_665393/t1323159.shtml|title=The Forum on China-Africa Cooperation Johannesburg Action Plan(2016-2018)|last=|first=|date=10 December 2015|website=Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160227034517/http://www.fmprc.gov.cn/mfa_eng/wjdt_665385/2649_665393/t1323159.shtml|archive-date=2016-02-27|dead-url=yes|access-date=1 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Goals ==
Digital Divide is an inequality with regard to access to, use of, or impact of [[Information and communications technology|information and communication technologies]] (ICT). African countries are suffering from the Digital Divide and many Africans, especially families in rural areas, are blocked from accessing information and digital technology.

One of the main goals of the [[United Nations]] [[Sustainable Development Goals|2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development]] is to “significantly increase access to information and communications technology and strive to provide universal and affordable access to the Internet in least developed countries by 2020”.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/blog/2016/12/with-nearly-4-billion-people-still-offline-un-forum-to-tackle-digital-divide/|title=With nearly 4 billion people still offline, UN forum to tackle "digital divide"|last=|first=|date=7 December 2016|website=United Nations|access-date=1 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Benefits ==

=== Population ===
The project will open a window for African rural families. Through television people will be able to acquire more useful information about the world. They will also have access to agriculture, science or sanitation's knowledge which will impact positively their daily lives&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.guinee360.com/19/01/2018/conakry-alpha-conde-lance-le-projet-acces-a-la-television-satellite-pour-10-000-villages-africains/|title=Conakry : Alpha Condé lance le projet « Accès à la télévision satellite pour 10.000 villages africains »|last=|first=|date=19 January 2018|website=Guinee 360|language=French|access-date=12 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;. This will expand their horizon and help them to get rid of poverty.

Project will also create local jobs&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://actuconakry.com/2018/01/19/la-chine-a-travers-startimes-lance-a-conakry-le-projet-acces-a-la-tv-satellite-pour-dix-mille-villages-africains-devant-alpha-conde/|title=La Chine à travers Startimes lance à Conakry le projet » Accès à la TV Satellite pour Dix mille villages africains « devant Alpha Condé|last=|first=|date=19 January 2018|website=Actu Conakry|language=French|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180119153338/http://actuconakry.com/2018/01/19/la-chine-a-travers-startimes-lance-a-conakry-le-projet-acces-a-la-tv-satellite-pour-dix-mille-villages-africains-devant-alpha-conde/|archive-date=2018-01-19|dead-url=yes|access-date=12 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Staff will be hired and trained to maintain hardware and ensure the long-term operation of the project.

=== Countries ===
Knowledge and information villagers will have access to will promote the development of rural areas of each country&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://energies-media.com/chine-demarre-projet-tv-numerique-10-000-villages-africains-guinee/|title=La Chine démarre le projet “TV numérique pour 10 000 villages africains” en Guinée, avec des systèmes d’alimentation solaire|last=|first=|date=19 January 2018|website=Energies-media|language=French|access-date=12 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

Access to digital TV will also accelerate [[digital television transition]] of the participating countries. That will expand coverage area of African local TV stations and promote TV industry's upgrade in Africa.

The project will narrow gaps between countries and regions in Africa, which will reduce inequality between African countries. Digital TV used to be luxury in African markets but the project of “Access to Satellite TV for 10,000 African Villages” will help break the monopoly of digital TV industry as well as promote a balanced development in African region.

== Villages ==
There will be total 10,112 villages in 25 African countries benefiting from the project “Access to Satellite TV for 10,000 African Villages”.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The 25 countries are: Nigeria, South Africa, Kenya, Tanzania, Madagascar, Mozambique, Côte d'Ivoire, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, D.R.C., Guinea, Ghana, Senegal, Cameroon, Rwanda, Burundi, Benin, Eritrea, Chad, Central Africa, Congo Brazzaville, Guinea-Bissau, Namibia and Gabon.

== Equipment ==
Chinese government will aid each village with two Projector TVs, one 32 inch Digital TV set and 20 [[Satellite television|DTH]] decoders and satellite dishes. Projector TVs and Digital TV set will be equipped with [[Photovoltaic system|solar power systems]] and DTH access units.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.fatala-infos.org/politique/societe-le-groupe-startimes-lance-le-projet-acces-a-la-tv-satellite-pour-dix-mille-villages-africains-en-guinee/1416/|title=Société : le groupe starTimes lance le projet " Accès a la TV Satellite pour dix mille villages africains " en Guinée|last=|first=|date=19 January 2018|work=Fatala-infos|access-date=1 February 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180201201450/https://www.fatala-infos.org/politique/societe-le-groupe-startimes-lance-le-projet-acces-a-la-tv-satellite-pour-dix-mille-villages-africains-en-guinee/1416/|archive-date=2018-02-01|dead-url=yes|language=French|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Projector TV can project more than 120 inches picture screen in the wall and use [[Digital Light Processing|DLP]] technology and [[Light-emitting diode|LED]] light source with high brightness and low power.

The StarTimes Digital TV set supports signal input of satellite TV without a decoder and its smart operation system supports automatic system maintenance and upgrade. Comparing with CRT TV sets, the Digital TV set saves 50% power and comes with HD LED screen category, Dolby audio system, wide voltage input, [[HDMI]] and [[USB]] ports.

The Projector TVs and Digital TV set will be laid out in the public area of the village, like school or village clinic, which could allow all villagers, especially kids, to enjoy the wonderful digital TV programs.

To cope with the problem of power shortage in African rural areas, the Projector TVs and Digital TV set will be outfitted with solar power system, which can support the people to watch TV for 6 hours without electricity after sunset.

The decoders adopt the advanced standard [[High Efficiency Video Coding|H.265]], which can support the input of HD digital signals from the satellite directly.

== Implementation ==
Digital TV operator [[StarTimes]] has been chosen to carry out the project under the guide of Chinese and African governments.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.caixinglobal.com/2018-01-24/china-woos-guinea-with-satellite-tv-deal-101202396.html|title=China Woos Guinea with Satellite-TV Deal|last=Mo|first=Yelin|date=24 January 2018|work=Caixin|access-date=1 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

StarTimes will supply all hardware of the project, install them in each village of the 25 countries as well as maintain equipment once the project is complete.

'''Blaze''' was a [[rocking-horse]] toy produced by [[Mattel]] toymakers and introduced in 1961. Blaze was featured prominently during children's television advertising (Mattel was the very first toymaker to advertise year around with [[television commercials]]). Unlike other rocking-horses of the time, Blaze was mounted on a stand that was said to be "untippable" and had no [[spring (device)|springs]]. The apparatus prevented pinched fingers, and was fitted out with a mechanism that moved the horses legs in "real life action." Another Mattel feature allowed Blaze to talk when you pulled his "[[Magic Ring]]." His talking voice unit was the very same one produced by Mattel and unveiled in 1960 in its talking [[Chatty Cathy]] doll, and later toys like the Talking [[Mister Ed]] puppet. Blaze could say 11 different things like, "How about some hay?"; he could also whinny and neigh. A toy like this, that could [[Horse gait#Gallop|gallop]] and move realistically when the horse was rocked forward and backward, was something special.

Blaze was made of what Mattel called "hi-impact [[plastic]]" with black-and-white markings (a [[pinto pony]]), and a molded black [[saddle]] and red [[blanket]]. Blaze also had attached [[rein]]s, fixed hand-posts, and 2-position [[foot rest]]s. The stand was made of 1-inch [[tubular steel]] and was advertised as being "untippable." Saddle height was 29&amp;nbsp;inches and was recommended for ages 1–7. Blaze was marketed in most retail catalogs, such as [[Sears, Roebuck and Company|Sears]], [[J.C. Penney]], and [[Montgomery Wards]]. When first issued, Blaze did not have the talking feature, this was added very quickly after his initial release, so there may be versions of this toy that do not, and never did, talk.

Lately they have been touring with their latest creation, ''Insane in the Brain'', a streetdance version of ''[[One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest (disambiguation)|One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest]]'', named after [[Cypress Hill]]'s featured song, "[[Insane in the Brain]]".

Now they are working on their final production as a group "[[The Last Bounce]]" at [[Ericsson Globe Arena]] in [[Stockholm]].

==History==

They have inspired each other with many different dance styles, Breaking, Locking, Popping, Boogaloo, New School, Jazz, [[Lindy Hop]] and Tap. Today they are ready to use any style of dance to create new and surprising shows.

When Bounce started to practise together they knew pretty soon that they wanted to do something more. At first they thought that they wouldn’t stay together for very long so they wanted to do a show before summer 2007. At that time they didn’t know that Bounce would last for seven years.

In 1998 Bounce's first show premiered and was called Rot. Right after that they toured in Sweden with the production Asfalt. At that time they needed something different after working hard for a long time. They went to [[Los Angeles]] to work and practice. In the summer 1999 the show Rotmos, inspired by L.A, was performed in an outdoor arena in the center of Stockholm.

Bounce was invited to tour with the Riksteater and Freaky Flow was created for the spring of 2000. During the practice of Freaky Flow the English producer Nick Grace contacted them and they came to an agreement for a new show to be created for Stockholm and London. The new show was called Bounce The Show and one of the words greatest lighting designers, Patrick Woodroffe, was working with them. On this show they really went for it and added 7 more dancers to perform with them.

Bounce came back to Sweden to do 24 sold-out shows at Dansens Hus after being in London for two months and then went back for another 10 weeks at the Roundhouse. During the London period Filmon Michael replaced Joe Jobe after he had badly injured his knee, and in the late autumn 2002 Filmon became a full member of Bounce Streetdance Company.
Bounce vs Petter was the next production and started in winter 2001/2002. It was the first time a dancegroup and a recording artist worked together to make a theatrical experience. On outdoor stages they toured around Sweden with 10 performances during the summer 2002 with a great show at Skansen as an end in front of 5000 screaming people.

For six months in 2003 Bounce collected their best dance- and visual ideas to shape the new show The Score and its storyline. This was the biggest dance show ever in Sweden and was about seven criminals coming together to do a heist, chased by the cop (danced by Lil'Tim, UK). Even in Norway and Denmark The Score was shown. Almost 100.000 audiences came to watch 116 shows in Scandinavia.

Bounce Live was a two years project with live musician led by André Ferrari and a story about Bounce and personally told stories. The musician passion and attitude help them to create the air of warm and soul that Bounce was looking for to share with the audience. The show was performed on the music hall Nalen. This has given a great experience to perform so close to the audience. They did 46 shows in the spring after the premiere in January 2005 and then toured around in Sweden in the fall.

In 2005 the TV-show Floorfiller aired with Bounce as judges and choreographers. At the same time they started to prepare for the new show ''One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest''. Before the show people had wondering how it would be possible to tell this story with dance. This had been the most challenging they ever had created. But the audiences had understood the story through pure hiphop. The danceshow had almost as many shows as The Score and was rewarded with SvD Opera-Prize.

In 2008 Bounce continued to perform with ''One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest'' or another name for it ''Insane in the Brain'' in Sweden and in the UK. When they were back in Sweden they took some time away from each other to get new energy and collect new fresh ideas. Back together the group stated to plan their next show Caution with live barking dogs and crazy stunt, inspired by De La Guarda, to push their limits and challenge them. Caution had premier in February 2009 at the Orion Theatre and played at full houses for four months. When Caution ended they held their annually Bounce Summercamp where people from all over the world joined for three weeks.

Bounce made a Flash Mob in tribute to Michael Jackson in the summer 2009 that got over 8 million hits on YouTube. Just a little while after the first one they ended Bounce Summercamp with another Flash Mob who was called the Human domino with the dancer from the camp on the amusement park Gröna Lund.

In September they returned to London to once again do ''Insane in the Brain'' at the Peacock Theater with a followed with a UK tour. Totally more than 125,000 people have seen the show until now and a new UK-tour is planned in June 2010 at the Peacock Theatre.

On April 23, 2010 Bounce last dance show has premier at the Ericsson Globe and is called The Last Bounce. The show is going to contain some of the highlight from Bounce early shows mixed with new numbers with over hundred guestdancers.

On May 14, Fredrik Rydman and Jennie Widegrens choreography will appear at the opening segment of the [[Eurovision Song Contest 2013]] in Malmö.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11247">'''Box hockey''' is an active hand game played between two people with sticks, a puck and a compartmented box (typically {{convert|5|-|8|ft|m|disp=or|sp=us}} long), and typically played outdoors.  The object of the game is to move a [[hockey puck]] through the center dividers, of the box, out through a hole placed at each end of the box, also known as the [[Goal (sport)|goal]].  The two players face one another on either side of the box, and each attempts to move the puck to their left.  If a player succeeds in getting the puck to exit the box through the goal, the player scores one point (or goal).  The first player to score the predetermined number of goals wins the game.

==History==
[[File:Boxhockey1935.jpg|thumb|right|Four-player box hockey being played in Miami, FL 1935]]

Box hockey has little known origin, but the game has been around since at least the late 19th century, as described in various game books, such as ''Games for the Playground, Home, School and Gym'' ([[Jessie H. Bancroft]], 1913) and ''400 Games for School, Home, and Playground'' (F.A. Owen Pub. Co., 1920).  

Box Hockey was listed as the "Game of the Month" as published in the 1914 Volume 2 of the "Recreational helps" by the [[New York State College of Agriculture]] Department of Rural Sociology with the following description:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"Box hockey is an excellent active game for picnics camps and playgrounds. It can also be adapted to indoor recreation if the floor upon which it is played is well padded with old rugs to prevent being damaged with the hockey sticks." 

"Equipment: Take two pieces [boards] of lumber 2 inches by 10 inches by 8 or 10 feet [5&amp;nbsp;cm&amp;nbsp;× 25&amp;nbsp;cm&amp;nbsp;× 2.4 or 3.0&amp;nbsp;m], and two [end] pieces 1 inch by 10 inches by 4 foot [2.5&amp;nbsp;cm&amp;nbsp;× 25&amp;nbsp;cm&amp;nbsp;× 1.2&amp;nbsp;m] and construct a rectangular box fastening it together with spike nails or wagon bed rods. Take another board 2 inches by 10 inches by 4 feet [5&amp;nbsp;cm&amp;nbsp;× 25&amp;nbsp;cm&amp;nbsp;× 1.2 m] and nail it into the rectangular frame, dividing it into two equal compartments. On the bottom side of the box, cut a hole {{frac|3|1|2}} inches at the base and about {{frac|2|1|2}} inches high [8.9&amp;nbsp;cm&amp;nbsp;× 6.4&amp;nbsp;cm] in the center of each of the end boards, and cut two such holes in the bottom of the dividing board, which make the two equal compartments. These last two holes should be equidistant from the sides of the box. Now get a couple of three-foot [91&amp;nbsp;cm] sticks  and an old baseball and you are ready to play. Almost any kind of a stick will do. Saplings cut off underneath the ground so as to get the curve are very good. Also cheap commercial hockey sticks with the blade reinforced with vtirc are excellent."&lt;/blockquote&gt; 

Around 1937, [[Milton Bradley]] sold a box hockey game (model No. 4125).&lt;ref&gt;"AGCA-The Game Catalog, 8th Edition, Oct. 1998&lt;/ref&gt; By the late 1930s and into the 1940s, it was not uncommon for towns to host youth box hockey tournaments, such as in [[Reading, Pennsylvania]], where the winners of the Essick Playground and Oakbrook were reported by the local newspaper in the July 11, 1939, July 4, 1941 and June 29, 1949 issues of the ''[[Reading Eagle]]''.

By the 1950s, [[Sears &amp; Roebuck]] was selling a mass-produced version of box hockey for 50 cents.&lt;ref&gt;The Milwaukee Journal - Aug 8, 1950&lt;/ref&gt; In the mid-1950s adult box hockey clubs in [[Eugene, Oregon]] battled for the title "Springfield Box Hockey service club champions".&lt;ref&gt;Eugene Register-Guard - Mar 7, 1954&lt;/ref&gt; 

In the mid-1950s, Larry Best, Director of Recreation for the Milton Hershey School for Boys in Hershey, PA (the Milton Hershey School was established in 1909 by Milton S. Hershey), in search of an activity that would be healthy, active and fun for the students, became aware of the game BOX HOCKEY and introduced it to the students as part of their summer recreation program.  Individual play as well as school tournaments were promoted, and Box Hockey is still an active program at the school with almost 75 student homes (approx. 16 students per home) each having a game set today, manufactured by Box Hockey International, Inc.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.box-hockey.com&lt;/ref&gt;

World Wide Games, Inc. in [[Delaware, Ohio]], manufactured the suitcase-style hockey box in 1965; one is on display at the [[Elliott Avedon Museum &amp; Archive of Games]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gamesmuseum.uwaterloo.ca/VirtualExhibits/hockey/boxhockey/index.html&lt;/ref&gt;

In the mid-1970s to early 1980s, box hockey had a major resurgence in the United States, as a part of the dramatic increase in funding and staffing in municipal recreation and parks departments across the country to reduce youth crime and violence that was prevalent in the late 1960s and early 1970s, by providing activities to keep teenagers active and social.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://rptsweb.tamu.edu/Faculty/Witt/conpubs/bembry98.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-12-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100224074213/http://rptsweb.tamu.edu/faculty/witt/conpubs/bembry98.htm |archivedate=2010-02-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1994, Andy Brody founded Box Hockey International and started to market and mass-produce the larger floor version.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.box-hockey.com/&lt;/ref&gt; This variant of the game features multiple walls with staggered "house holes" through which the puck must be passed to reach either goal. Today, many children play the larger floor version in summer camps throughout the upper part of North America, such as Triumphant Life Camp in [[Larabee Valley, California]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tlcamp.com/attractions |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-12-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090213234515/http://www.tlcamp.com/attractions/ |archivedate=2009-02-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Wilderness Northwest on the [[Olympic Peninsula]] in [[Washington state]],&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wildernessnw.org/&lt;/ref&gt; and Shady Hollow Campground in [[Brainerd, Minnesota]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.shadyhollowresort.com/&lt;/ref&gt;  Box hockey is also used for agility training in [[hockey]] schools and camps throughout [[Canada]] and the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

Handmade suitcase-style box hockey games are still available at crafts events like the [[Lowell Folk Festival]] in [[Lowell, Massachusetts]].  Each year they also have a dozen or so set up for playing during the festivities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lowellfolkfestival.org/family.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-12-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100309210630/http://www.lowellfolkfestival.org/family.html |archivedate=2010-03-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern rules==
*To start the game (and after each goal), the puck is placed under the center mouse hole. Each player raps the bottom of the box with his [[hockey stick]] and then taps his opponent's blade, repeating this three times. After the third tap, both players can go after the puck and play begins.
*Each player hits the puck with his hockey stick blade, attempting to move the puck through the holes to his left (see diagram) and out the hole at the end of the box (the goal).
*In addition to advancing the puck towards his own goal, each player can use his blade to block his opponent's progress or to steal the puck.
*It is legal to use the blade to block the goal from either inside or outside of the box.
*When a player succeeds in getting the puck to exit the box through the goal, the player scores one point.
*The first player to score 11 points wins the game.

==Traditional rules==
[[File:BoxHockeyPhili1930.jpg|thumb|right|Box Hockey in the streets of Philadelphia 1930]]
*Each player stands on opposite sides of the box.  Your goal is to the right as you face the box, and your opponent's goal is to the left.
*To start, and after each goal, the puck placed flat, centered, on top of middle wall for the [[Face-off|face off]].  Each player taps the bottom of their side of the box with their stick and then raises it to tap their opponent's stick directly above the puck in [[rhythm]], repeating this three times.  After the third tap, both players try to knock the puck off the wall.
*Each player takes turns with two hits, and whichever side of the center wall the puck lands on determines who goes first.  The player with the furthest distance to score goes first.
*Each player hits the puck with their stick, moving the puck through the holes to their left (see diagram) and through goal.
*To score, you must get the puck completely through your opponent's goal.
*Interfering with your opponent is not allowed.
*The dragging or carrying of the puck is not allowed.
*Pinning the puck in the corner is allowed.
*The first player to score 3 goals wins the game.
* "McPherson's Rules", also occasionally utilized at the "Waterworks" do not prohibit interference, but in fact, encourage it. Speed and interference are tantamount to finesse and aptitude while eliminating any need for prohibition of "dragging".

==Modern equipment==
The equipment needed to play the game is as follows:
#'''Box'''. Approximately 8&amp;nbsp;ft long by 3.3&amp;nbsp;ft wide by 1&amp;nbsp;ft high (2.4&amp;nbsp;m&amp;nbsp;× 1.0&amp;nbsp;m&amp;nbsp;× 0.30&amp;nbsp;m) constructed with a [[plywood]] bottom and three plywood dividers (to create four sections in the box). Each divider has one or more "mouse holes" that are slightly wider than the puck.
#'''Two hockey sticks, shortened'''. Each player uses one floor hockey stick (plastic) whose shaft has been shortened to {{convert|12|-|18|in|cm|0}}.
#'''One hockey puck'''. A floor hockey puck (plastic, hollow) is the best type of puck to be used in box hockey.

'''''Carrington''''' is a 1995 British [[biographical film]] written and directed by [[Christopher Hampton]] about the life of the [[England|English]] painter [[Dora Carrington]] (1893–1932), who was known simply as "Carrington". The screenplay is based on biographies of writer and critic [[Lytton Strachey]] (1880–1932) by [[Michael Holroyd]].

==Plot==
The film, starring [[Emma Thompson]] in the title role, focuses on her unusual relationship with the author [[Lytton Strachey]], played by [[Jonathan Pryce]], as well as with other members of the [[Bloomsbury Group]].

The film is divided into 6 chapters.
[[File:CarringtonTidmarsh.png|thumb|left|300px|A painting by Carrington of the "Mill House", [[Tidmarsh]], [[Pangbourne]], on the upper [[Thames]].]]
# ''Lytton &amp; Carrington 1915'': During the [[World War I|Great War]], Lytton Strachey is travelling to the country and staying at [[Vanessa Bell]]'s [[Charleston Farmhouse|house]]. There he meets Carrington for the first time but confuses her with a boy and does not hide his disappointment. Lytton is due to face a hearing with the military due to his open opposition to the war. While taking a hike through the countryside, he tries to kiss Carrington but she refuses him. Early in the morning, she walks into his bedroom with the intent of cutting his beard off in retaliation for the kiss, but stops at the last minute in contemplation of him sleeping and falls in love with him.
# ''Gertler 1916–1918'': [[Mark Gertler (artist)|Mark Gertler]] tries to have sex with Carrington, but she refuses, since she thinks that he is only interested in her sexually. Gertler turns to Lytton for aid in wooing her. Carrington falls more deeply in love with Lytton and although he does not fully requite her, he does have feelings for her. While on a trip to Wales he proposes that they live together, acting on this, Carrington searches for a house and finds and refurbishes Mill House in Tidmarsh. When Gertler finds out that Carrington and Lytton are moving in together he attacks the couple.
# ''Partridge 1918–1921'': Carrington meets [[Ralph Partridge]], who has come back from the war. On their first dinner together, Ralph expresses his rather one-sided points of view which are contrary to Lytton's; nevertheless the rugged man has great appeal to Lytton. Lytton goes on vacation to Italy, Ralph has made very clear his intent of marrying Carrington or leaving altogether to Bolivia to run a sheep farm. Knowing that if Ralph is no longer with him, Lytton will move out of Mill House, Carrington marries Ralph and writes Lytton a poignant letter confessing her love for him and her knowledge that it is hopeless.  On their honeymoon, Carrington and Ralph meet with Lytton in Venice. Ralph introduces his friend [[Gerald Brenan]] to Lytton and Carrington. Brenan is planning to leave for Spain in order to improve his education and takes a liking to Carrington, which is mutual. He demands she leave Lytton to be with him.  She refuses but they continue the relationship until they get caught by Ralph. Lytton manages to avoid the break-up and secretly aids the couple to continue their affair until it ends by itself. Lytton is successful in the publication of ''[[Eminent Victorians]]''. 
# ''Ham Spray House 1924–1931'': Lytton, now wealthy and famous, buys Ham Spray and moves in with Carrington and Ralph. Ralph has begun a relationship with Frances Marshall, and Lytton is in a relationship with Roger Stenhouse, a younger man from Oxford, while Carrington is carrying on an affair with Beacus Penrose, a strapping seaman who has little to say and keeps trying to change Carrington to fit his fantasies, although he admits that he is not attracted to her sexually. Carrington becomes pregnant by Beacus but has an abortion. Lytton takes an apartment in London where he intends to live with Roger, but it becomes clear that the relationship will not be long-lived.
# ''Lytton 1931–1932'': Roger and Lytton break up. During a tea party Lytton suddenly becomes ill; Carrington initially is optimistic but soon it becomes evident that his illness is serious and he will not recover. Carrington tries to commit suicide by locking herself in the garage with the car motor running but is rescued by Ralph. When Lytton finally dies, attended by Ralph, Carrington and Gerald, he states "''If this is dying, I don't think much of it.''" Carrington is utterly devastated but manages to convince Ralph and Frances that she is all right and simply needs to be alone. Once they have left, she burns all of Lytton's personal possessions, takes a gun and finally manages to kill herself.

The score of the film was composed by [[Michael Nyman]]. It was primarily based upon his ''[[String Quartets 1–3#String Quartet No. 3|String Quartet No.3]]'', with which Hampton created a [[temp track]], and wanted as a [[leitmotif]] for Lytton Strachey. The score is also based on [[Franz Schubert|Schubert]]'s [[String Quintet (Schubert)|String Quintet in C, D. 956]], whose Adagio is played during a scene in the film. However, there is also newly composed material for the film, including "Virgin on the roof," which was incorporated into the ''[[The Suit and the Photograph#String Quartet No. 4|String Quartet No. 4]]'', and the theme for Mark Gertler, which is derived from ''[[The Suit and the Photograph#3 Quartets|3 Quartets]]'', which was composed at roughly the same time.

'''''Crank: High Voltage''''' (billed as '''''Crank 2: High Voltage''''' in some regions and on DVD) is a 2009 American [[action film|action]] [[comedy film]] and the [[sequel]] to ''[[Crank (film)|Crank]]''. The film was written and directed by [[Neveldine/Taylor|Mark Neveldine and Brian Taylor]] and stars [[Jason Statham]] reprising his role as Chev Chelios. The story of the film resumes shortly after the first film left off, in the current film, the ex-hit man Chev Chelios finds out he must fight on his life once again as his true heart is transferred and he becomes equipped with an artificial heart, and he reveals he must get injected with electric shocks in order to stay alive and kill those who did it to him. Alongside Statham, the film also stars [[Dwight Yoakam]] (reprising his role as Doc Miles), [[Bai Ling]], [[Amy Smart]] (reprising her role as Eve), [[Efren Ramirez]], [[Reno Wilson]] and [[Clifton Collins, Jr.]].

The film was released in the United Kingdom on April 15, 2009, two days prior to its North American release date; April 17, 2009. Upon its release, ''Crank: High Voltage'' received positive reviews with many praising the acting, action sequences, humor, story and writing.

==Plot==
Immediately after the events of [[Crank (film)|the previous film]], Chev Chelios ([[Jason Statham]]) lands in the middle of an intersection after falling out of a helicopter. He is scooped off the street via snow shovel by a group of Chinese medics and removed from the scene. Chev wakes up in a makeshift hospital and sees doctors removing his heart while Johnny Vang ([[Art Hsu]]) watches. The doctors place Chev's heart in a white cooler with a padlock, and place a clear plastic [[artificial heart]] in his chest. He wakes up sometime later and escapes. He notices a yellow battery pack is attached to him. After a gunfight and interrogation of a thug, he learns the location of Johnny Vang: the Cypress Social Club.

Chev calls Doc Miles ([[Dwight Yoakam]]), who says that Chev has been fitted with an [[AbioCor|AbioCor artificial heart]]. Miles informs Chev that once the external battery pack runs out, the internal battery will kick in and he will have 60 minutes before it stops working. While driving Chev crashes his car which destroys his external battery pack. After getting directions from a driver, Chelios has the driver use his jumper cables on him. At the club, Chev loses Vang but picks up a hooker named Ria ([[Bai Ling]]) who sends him to a strip club where Vang is hiding out. In the club, Chev finds Eve ([[Amy Smart]]), now a stripper (It is humorously revealed that the phone call Chev made to Eve while falling to his supposed death at the end of ''Crank'' was completely incomprehensible due to the wind rushing by, and the farewell he had left on her answering machine was merely how he imagined it would sound). A group of Mexican mobsters, led by Chico, show up looking for Chelios. After a gunfight, Chev learns that a mobster named "El Hurón" ("The Ferret") wants to kill him, but he doesn't find out why.

Outside of the strip club, Chev commandeers a police cruiser with Eve and another stripper. The stripper tells Chev that he should look at the Hollywood Racetrack for Johnny Vang. Along the way, Chev meets Venus ([[Efren Ramirez]]), who reveals himself to be Kaylo's brother (and unable to completely control his body due to "full-body [[Tourettes]].") Wanting his help, he tells Venus that El Huron was involved in his brother's death, but escaped. At the horse track Chev begins losing energy again. Another call to Doc Miles informs him that friction will cause static electricity to power the internal battery. Chev's attempts to generate electricity by rubbing himself against members of the audience prove ineffective, but Eve later arrives and they have sex on the racetrack, which generates enough friction to charge the heart. Chev spots Vang and leaves Eve behind. Vang escapes, and Chev is about to be subdued by security when Don Kim picks Chev up in his limo. He informs Chev that there is an ancient and prominent leader in the Triads named Poon Dong ([[David Carradine]]), who was in need of a heart transplant and chose Chev's to replace his. Chev kills Don Kim and his henchmen upon learning that Don Kim wishes to return him to Poon Dong for a reward. Meanwhile, Venus calls in Orlando ([[Reno Wilson]]) to assist in tracking down El Huron.

While searching for Vang, Chev boards an ambulance and steals a battery pack for his artificial heart. Chev exits the ambulance upon seeing Johnny Vang on the street outside and a shootout ensues before Chev subdues Vang. Chev discovers that Vang's red cooler doesn't contain his heart (it actually contains something that Chelios finds utterly disgusting but is never specified in the film). He then learns via cellphone from Doc Miles that his heart has already been transplanted into Poon Dong (who is shown using it to engage in various acts of revelry and depravity). Johnny Vang is shot and killed by Chico as Chev questions him, after which Chev is knocked unconscious. Doc Miles uses his secretary, Dark Chocolate, to lure Poon Dong into his apartment and retrieve Chev's heart.

Chev has a flashback seeing himself as a young boy, being [[Interrogation|interrogated]] by his mother ([[Geri Halliwell]]) and Luke Cunard (Jamie Harris) on the Luke Cunard show about his violent attitude and his already extensive criminal activities.

Chev is taken to an island where El Huron awaits. It is revealed that El Huron is, in fact, the brother of Ricky and Alex Verona, both of whom Chelios killed in the first film. He reveals Ricky Verona's head is being kept alive long enough to watch El Huron kill Chelios. El Huron is about to kill Chelios when Orlando, Venus and Ria show up, each with their own group of gunfighters, and a fierce shootout ensues. Chev kicks Rick Verona's disembodied head in the nearby swimming pool. Venus engages El Huron in a fight before he can kill Chev. As he starts to slow down, Chev climbs a nearby electric pole and grabs a pair of live wires to recharge. He is flung off the pole and set on fire by the massive current. He returns fully powered and on fire, just in nick of time to save Venus, and kills El Huron.  Due to a hallucination caused by the electric currents, he sees Ria as Eve and kisses her, inadvertently setting her on fire as well.  Chelios walks towards the camera, giving the [[Finger (gesture)|middle finger]] [[Breaking the fourth wall|to the audience]].

During the first portion of the end credits, Doc Miles replaces Chev's heart. At first it looks like a failure, but Chelios's eyes open wide and his heart monitor indicates normal activity.

===Critical response===
{{Quote box |quote="Watching Jason Statham making jokes about 'chinks' doesn't make the film edgy or daring ... Neveldine/Taylor would never have dared to feature such racial slurs about black people; so why on earth is it acceptable to do it about another ethnic group?"

[[File:Let alone2.jpg|thumb|''Lodgings to Let'', an 1814 engraving featuring a double entendre.&lt;br /&gt;He: "My sweet honey, I hope you are to be [[renting|let]] with the Lodgins!"&lt;br /&gt;She: "No, sir, I am to be let &lt;u&gt;alone&lt;/u&gt;".]]

A '''double entendre''' ({{IPAc-en|ɒ̃|ˈ|t|ɒ̃|d|(|r|ə|)}}; {{IPA-fr|dubl ɑ̃.tɑ̃dʁ(ə)|lang}}) is a [[figure of speech]] or a particular way of wording that is devised to be understood in two ways, having a double meaning. Typically one of the meanings is obvious, given the context, whereas the other may require more thought. The [[innuendo]] may convey a message that would be socially awkward, sexually suggestive, or offensive to state directly (the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' describes a double entendre as being used to "convey an indelicate meaning", whilst ''[[Longman Dictionary of Contemporary English]]'' defines it as "a word or phrase that may be understood in two different ways, one of which is often sexual").&lt;ref name="Longman"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ldoceonline.com/dictionary/double-entendre | title=Longman Dictionary of Contemporary English online | publisher=Longman | work=Dictionary of Contemporary English | accessdate=29 August 2014 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140903083027/http://www.ldoceonline.com/dictionary/double-entendre | archivedate=3 September 2014 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A double entendre may exploit [[pun]]s to convey the second meaning. Double entendres generally rely on multiple meanings of words, or different interpretations of the same primary meaning. They often exploit [[ambiguity]] and may be used to introduce it deliberately in a text.  Sometimes a [[homophone]] (i.e., another word which sounds the same) can be used as a pun.  When three or more meanings have been constructed, this is known as a "triple entendre", etc.

== Structure ==
A person who is unfamiliar with the hidden or alternative meaning of a sentence may fail to detect its [[innuendo]]s, aside from observing that others find it humorous for no apparent reason. Perhaps because it is not offensive to those who do not recognise it, innuendo is often used in [[sitcom]]s and other [[comedy]] where the audience may enjoy the humour while being oblivious to its secondary meaning.

A triple entendre is a phrase that can be understood in any of three ways, such as in the back cover of the 1981 [[Rush (band)|Rush]] album ''[[Moving Pictures (Rush album)|Moving Pictures]]'' which shows a [[moving company]] carrying paintings out of a building while people are shown being emotionally moved and a film crew makes a "[[moving picture]]" of the whole scene.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nimitz.net/rush/faq2ans.html#82|title=The Rush Frequently Asked Questions on the Internet File|work=nimitz.net|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170222184534/http://www.nimitz.net/rush/faq2ans.html#82|archivedate=22 February 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Etymology ==
The expression comes from [[French language|French]] ''double'' = "double" and ''entendre'' = "to hear" (but also "to understand"&lt;ref name="TLFi"&gt;[http://www.cnrtl.fr/definition/entendre definition of entendre] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120429210121/http://www.cnrtl.fr/definition/entendre |date=29 April 2012 }}, ''sub'' II at www.cnrtl.fr, accessed on 23 March 2012&lt;/ref&gt;). However, the English formulation is a corruption of the authentic French expression ''à double entente'' ("double meaning").&lt;ref name="reverso"&gt;[http://dictionnaire.reverso.net/francais-definition/entente definition of Entente] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120322053028/http://dictionnaire.reverso.net/francais-definition/entente |date=22 March 2012 }} at dictionnaire.reverso.net accessed on 20 November 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Modern French uses ''double sens'' instead; the phrase ''double entendre'' has no real meaning in the modern French language.

== Usage ==

=== Literature ===
In [[Homer]]'s ''The [[Odyssey]]'', when [[Odysseus]] is captured by the [[Cyclops]] [[Polyphemus]], he tells the Cyclops that his name is Oudeis (ουδεις = No-one). When Odysseus attacks the Cyclops later that night and stabs him in the eye, the Cyclops runs out of his cave, yelling to the other cyclopes that "No-one has hurt me!", which leads the other cyclopes to take no action under the assumption that Polyphemus blinded himself by accident, allowing Odysseus and his men to escape.

[[File:Wanderer-Exeter-Book-first-page-Bernard-Muir.jpg|thumb|The first page of the poem "The Wanderer" found in the Exeter Book.]]
Some of the earliest double entendres are found in the [[Exeter Book]], or Codex exoniensis, at [[Exeter Cathedral]] in [[England]]. The book was copied around AD 975. In addition to the various poems and stories found in the book, there are also numerous riddles. The Anglo-Saxons did not reveal the answers to the riddles, but they have been answered by scholars over the years. Some riddles were double-entendres, such as [[Exeter Book#Riddle 25|Riddle 25]] ("I am a wondrous creature: to women a thing of joyful expectation, to close-lying companions serviceable. I harm no city-dweller excepting my slayer alone. My stem is erect and tall––I stand up in bed––and whiskery somewhere down below. Sometimes a countryman's quite comely daughter will venture, bumptious girl, to get a grip on me. She assaults my red self and seizes my head and clenches me in a cramped place. She will soon feel the effect of her encounter with me, this curl-locked woman who squeezes me. Her eye will be wet.") which suggests the answer "a [[Human penis|penis]]" but has the correct answer "an [[onion]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Exeter Book Riddles|url = http://penelope.uchicago.edu/~grout/encyclopaedia_romana/britannia/anglo-saxon/flowers/enigmata.html|website = penelope.uchicago.edu|accessdate = 2015-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Examples of [[innuendo|sexual innuendo]] and double-entendre occur in [[Geoffrey Chaucer]]'s ''[[The Canterbury Tales]]'' (14th century), in which the Wife of Bath's Tale is laden with double entendres. The most famous of these may be her use of the word "queynte" to describe both domestic duties (from the homonym "quaint") and genitalia ("queynte" being the root of '[[cunt]]', a [[Vulgarity|vulgar]] English word for [[vagina]]).  
The title of [[Sir Thomas More]]'s 1516 fictional work ''[[Utopia]]'' is a double entendre because of the [[pun]] between two [[Greek language|Greek]]-derived words that would have identical pronunciation: with his spelling, it means "no place"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.webster.com/dictionary/Utopia|title=Utopia – Definition of utopia by Merriam-Webster|work=webster.com|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071020052252/http://webster.com/dictionary/utopia|archivedate=20 October 2007|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; (as echoed later in [[Samuel Butler (novelist)|Samuel Butler]]'s later [[Erewhon]]); spelled as the rare word [[Eutopia]], it is pronounced the same&lt;ref&gt;A. D. Cousins, Macquarie University. [http://www.litencyc.com/php/sworks.php?rec=true&amp;UID=8578 "Utopia." The Literary Encyclopedia.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070711213449/http://www.litencyc.com/php/sworks.php?rec=true&amp;UID=8578 |date=11 July 2007 }}  25 October 2004. The Literary Dictionary Company. {{Nowrap|3 January}} 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; by [[English language|English]]-speaking readers, but has the meaning "good place".

Sometimes, it is unclear whether a double entendre was intended.  For example, the character [[Charley Bates]] from [[Charles Dickens]]' ''[[Oliver Twist]]'' is frequently referred to as Master Bates. The word "[[masturbation|masturbate]]" was in use when the book was written, and Dickens often used colourful names related to the natures of the characters.

The title of [[Damon Knight]]'s story ''[[To Serve Man]]'' is a double entendre which could mean "to perform a service to humanity" or "to serve a human as food". An alien [[cookbook]] with the title ''To Serve Man'' is featured in the story which could imply that the aliens eat humans. The story was the basis for [[To Serve Man (The Twilight Zone)|an episode]] of [[The Twilight Zone (1959 TV series)|''The Twilight Zone'']]. At the end of the episode the line "It's a cookbook!" reveals the truth.

=== Stage performances ===
[[File:Wilhelm Maria Hubertus Leibl 010.jpg|thumb|right|Flax on a distaff]]
Shakespeare frequently used double entendres in his plays. [[Sir Toby Belch]] in ''[[Twelfth Night]]'' says of [[Sir Andrew Aguecheek|Sir Andrew's]] hair, that "it hangs like [[flax]] on a [[distaff]]; and I hope to see a housewife take thee between her legs and spin it off"; [[Nurse (Romeo and Juliet)|the Nurse]] in ''[[Romeo and Juliet]]'' says that her husband had told [[Juliet]] when she was learning to walk that "Yea, dost thou fall upon thy face? Thou wilt fall backward when thou hast more wit"; or is told the time by [[Mercutio]]: "for the bawdy hand of the dial is now upon the [[Prick (slang)|prick]] of noon";  and in ''[[Hamlet]]'', [[Prince Hamlet|Hamlet]] publicly torments [[Ophelia (character)|Ophelia]] with a series of sexual puns, including "country matters" (similar to "[[cunt]]"). The title of Shakespeare's play ''[[Much Ado About Nothing]]'' is a pun on the Elizabethan use of "no-thing" as slang for [[vagina]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Williams |first=Gordon |year=1997 |title=''A Glossary of Shakespeare's Sexual Language'' |publisher=Althone Press  |ISBN= 0-485-12130-1 |page=219}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/books/booknews/8313901/Title-Deed-How-the-Book-Got-its-Name.html | location=London | work=The Daily Telegraph | first=Gary | last=Dexter | title=Title Deed: How the Book Got its Name | date=13 February 2011 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130917011921/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/books/booknews/8313901/Title-Deed-How-the-Book-Got-its-Name.html | archivedate=17 September 2013 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the UK, starting in the 19th century, [[Victorian morality]] disallowed sexual innuendo in the theatre as being unpleasant, particularly for the ladies in the audience. In [[music hall]] songs, on the other hand, this kind of innuendo remained very popular. [[Marie Lloyd]]'s song "She Sits Among the Cabbages and Peas" is an example of this. (Music hall in this context is to be compared with [[Variety show|Variety]], the one common, [[low-class]] and vulgar; the other [[demi-monde]], worldly and sometimes [[Chic (style)|chic]].)  In the 20th century there began to a crackdown on lewdness, including some prosecutions. It was the job of the [[Lord Chamberlain]] to examine the scripts of all plays for indecency. Nevertheless, some comedians still continued to get away with it. [[Max Miller (comedian)|Max Miller]], famously, had two books of jokes, a white book and a blue book, and would ask his audience which book they wanted to hear stories from. If they chose the blue book, he could blame the audience for the lewdness to follow, the white book was rarely used (in the UK, 'blue' [[Colloquialism|colloquially]] refers to sexual content, as in 'blue jokes', 'blue movies' etc.).

=== Radio and television ===
{{unreferenced section|date=March 2016}}
In the United States, innuendo and double entendre were only lightly used in radio media until the 1980s when the [[Howard Stern Show]] began to push the envelope of what was acceptable on the radio through use of double entendre and ironies. This garnered so much attention it spawned an entire genre of Radio called "[[Shock Jock]] Radio" where DJs will push the limits of what is an "acceptable" double entendre to use on over the air as the FCC has been known to hand out large fines for the use of double entendre on radio if they deem it to be in violation of their standards.

In Britain, innuendo humour began to transfer to [[radio]] and [[film|cinema]] from the late 1950s on. Particularly significant in this respect were the ''[[Carry On (series)|Carry On]]'' series of films and the [[BBC]] radio series ''[[Round the Horne]]'', although some of ''Round the Horne'' appeared to be nonsense language, the protagonists were sometimes having 'rude' conversations in [[Polari]] (gay slang). ''Round the Horne'' depended heavily on innuendo and double entendre, the show's name itself being a triple entendre, a play on the name of its central actor [[Kenneth Horne]] and those around him, the sailor's expression 'going round the horn' (i.e. [[Cape Horn]]), and the fact that 'horn' is slang for an [[erection]]. [[Spike Milligan]], writer of ''[[The Goon Show]]'', remarked that a lot of 'blue' (i.e. sexual) innuendo came from servicemen's jokes, which most of the cast understood (they all had been soldiers) and many of the audience understood, but which passed over the heads of most of the Senior BBC producers and directors, most of whom were "Officer class".

In 1968, the office of the [[Lord Chamberlain]] ceased to have responsibility for censoring live [[entertainment]], after the [[Theatres Act 1968]]. By the 1970s innuendo had become widely used across much of the British broadcast media, including [[British sitcom|sitcoms]] and [[radio comedy]], such as ''[[I'm Sorry I Haven't a Clue]]''. For example, in the 1970s TV comedy series ''[[Are You Being Served?]]'', Mrs. Slocombe frequently referred to her pet cat as her "pussy", apparently unaware of how easily her statement could be misinterpreted, such as "It's a wonder I'm here at all, you know. My pussy got soakin' wet. I had to dry it out in front of the fire before I left". Someone unfamiliar with sexual slang might find this statement funny simply because of the references to her sodden cat, whereas others would find further humour in the [[innuendo]] ("pussy" being [[sexual slang]] for vulva).

Modern comedies, such as the US version of ''[[The Office (U.S. TV series)|The Office]]'', often do not hide the addition of sexual innuendos into the script; for example, main character [[Michael Scott (The Office)|Michael Scott]] often deploys the phrase "[[Said the actress to the bishop|that's what she said]]" after another character's innocent statement, to turn it retroactively into a sexual pun.

On The Scott Mills Show on [[BBC Radio 1]], listeners are asked to send in clips from radio and TV with double meanings in a humorous context, a feature known as "Innuendo Bingo". Presenters and special guests fill their mouths with water and listen to the clips, and the last person to spit the water out with laughter wins the game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Innuendo Bingo|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p00hq228|accessdate=15 October 2012|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130102185555/http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p00hq228|archivedate=2 January 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Movies ===
{{unreferenced section|date=March 2016}}
Double entendres are popular in modern movies, as a way to conceal adult humour in a work aimed at general audiences. The [[James Bond]] films are rife with such humour.  For example, in ''[[Tomorrow Never Dies]]'' (1997), when Bond is disturbed by the telephone while in bed with a Danish girl, he explains to Moneypenny that he is busy "brushing up on a little Danish".  Moneypenny responds by pointing out that Bond was known as "a cunning linguist", a play on the word "[[cunnilingus]]". In the final scene of ''[[Moonraker (film)|Moonraker]]'', while Bond is taking Dr Holly Goodhead “round the world one more time”, Q says to Sir Frederick Gray, “I think he’s attempting re-entry, sir.” In ''[[The World Is Not Enough]]'' (1999), while in bed with Dr [[Christmas Jones]], Bond tells her “I thought Christmas only comes once a year”. Other obvious examples include [[Pussy Galore]] in ''[[Goldfinger (film)|Goldfinger]]'' and [[Holly Goodhead]] in ''Moonraker''. The double entendres of the Bond films were parodied in the ''[[Austin Powers (film series)|Austin Powers]]'' series.

Bawdy double entendres, such as "I'm the kinda girl who works for Paramount by day, and Fox all night", and (from the movie ''[[Myra Breckinridge (film)|Myra Breckinridge]]'') "I feel like a million tonight — but only one at a time", are typical of the comedy writing of [[Mae West]], for her early-career vaudeville performances as well as for her later plays and movies.

=== Music ===
{{unreferenced section|date=March 2016}}
Double entendres are very common in the titles and lyrics of pop songs, such as "[[If I Said You Had a Beautiful Body Would You Hold It Against Me]]" by The Bellamy Brothers, which is based on an old [[Groucho Marx]] quote. By one interpretation, the person being talked to is asked if they would be offended; by the other interpretation, they are asked if they would press their body against the person doing the talking.

Singer and songwriter [[Bob Dylan]], in his somewhat controversial song "[[Rainy Day Women No. 12 &amp; 35|Rainy Day Women #12 &amp; 35]]", repeats the line "Everybody must get stoned". In context, the phrase refers to the punishment of [[capital punishment|execution]] by [[stoning]], but on another level it means to 'get stoned', a common slang term for being high on [[cannabis (drug)|cannabis]]. In their song "Big Balls" on the album ''[[Dirty Deeds Done Dirt Cheap]]'', [[AC/DC]] the chorus "we've got big balls" can be read as referring to either [[ball (dance)|formal dances]] or [[testicle]]s.  During the 1940s, [[Benny Bell]] recorded several "party records" that contained double entendre including "Everybody Wants My Fanny".

=== Social interaction ===
Double entendres can arise in the replies to inquiries. The clichéd phrase "[[that's what she said]]", as well as "so to speak" can be used&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Fighter Pilot Speak | url = http://christianfighterpilot.com/blog/2006/06/13/fighter-pilot-linguistic-games-so-to-speak/ | accessdate = 11 February 2017 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150123010403/http://christianfighterpilot.com/blog/2006/06/13/fighter-pilot-linguistic-games-so-to-speak/ | archivedate = 23 January 2015 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; to remark on a sentence said by another which was not intended as a double entendre but nevertheless could be interpreted with a double meaning, one of them sexual. In recent times, due to prevalence of [[Meme|memes]], the sentence "If you know what I mean" has taken a similar meaning.

'''Eckart von Hirschhausen''' (born August 25, 1967 in [[Frankfurt am Main]], [[Germany]]) is a German [[physician]], [[comedian]] and talk show host.

==Academic career==
Eckart von Hirschhausen studied medicine, supported by a scholarship from the [[Studienstiftung des deutschen Volkes]] (Study foundation of the German people), at the [[Free University of Berlin]], the [[University of Heidelberg]] and the [[University of London]]. The subject of his doctoral thesis was 'Efficiency of intravenous immunoglobulin therapy on pigs in the hyperdynamic phase of endotoxemia' and he graduated ''magna cum laude'' from the University of Heidelberg. From 1996-1997 he studied scientific journalism at the [[Free University of Berlin]], but without taking a degree.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.fu-berlin.de/presse/publikationen/tsp/2006/ts_20060624/ts_20060624_04.html Humorvoll präsentieren]'' Artikel der FU Berlin&lt;/ref&gt;

==Journalism and television==
In 1996 he started writing, mainly for [[Focus (German magazine)|''Focus'']] and ''[[Der Tagesspiegel]]''. His first appearance on television is believed to have been as a guest contestant performing magic tricks in [[Jürgen von der Lippe]]'s show ''Geld oder Liebe'' ('Money or Love').&lt;ref&gt;Rüdiger Daniel, Winni Gahlen: ''Jürgen von der Lippe: Ein Porträt.'' Dokumentation, 2009, ausgestrahlt auf NDR-Fernsehen am 17. Februar 2009 um 21:45 Uhr (45 min).&lt;/ref&gt; From 1998 to 2003, he hosted the weekly health advisory show ''Service: Gesundheit'' ('Service: Health') on [[Hessischer Rundfunk]] Television. Since 2004 he has been a weekly contributor to ''[[Stern (magazine)|Stern]]: Sprechstunde'' ('''Stern'': Consultation Hour'): his column is called ''Die Etwas Andere Medizinkolumne'' ('The Somewhat Different Medicine Column').&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.stern.de/wissenschaft/gesund_leben/547399.html?nv=sb Sprechstunde]'', Dr. med. Eckart von Hirschhausen im ''stern''&lt;/ref&gt; 

Starting in the mid-1990s, Eckart von Hirschhausen has performed as a stand-up comedian, show host and magician in variety. He is also a cabaret artist performing his own, and other, cabaret programmes. He was a guest artist in Berlin, in London and at the [[Cologne]] Comedy Festival 1997. Hirschhausen was also a member of the panels of contributors to the ''Knoff-Hoff-Show'' on [[ZDF]] and ''[[7 Tage, 7 Köpfe]]'' ('7 days, 7 heads') on [[RTL Television|RTL]]. Since 21 January 2004, he has been answering viewers' questions in his column 'Dr. von Hirschhausen wills wissen' ('Dr. von Hirschhausen wants to know') in the scientific television show ''W wie Wissen'' ('K for Knowledge') on [[ARD (broadcaster)|ARD]]. In ''Hirschhausens Wissensbisse'' ('Hirschhausen's knowledge-bites') he also presents strange news and facts from the world of scientific research.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.daserste.de/wwiewissen/hirschhausen_dyn~flash,yes~cm.asp Hirschhausens WissensBisse]'', Das Erste, ''W wie Wissen''&lt;/ref&gt; Hirschhausen is a regular on the cabaret show ''Ottis Schlachthof'' ('Otti's Slaughterhouse') on [[Bayerisches Fernsehen]] and ''Quatsch Comedy Club'' on [[Pro Sieben]].&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.prosieben.de/show_comedy/qcc/comedians/00815/ Biografie: Eckart von Hirschhausen]'', ProSieben,'' Quatsch Comedy Club''.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007 he was a frequent guest on the ARD show [[Harald_Schmidt#Schmidt_.26_Pocher_.28ARD.29|'Schmidt and Pocher']]. He is also a speaker specialising in communication and motivational training. At the end of 2008, he founded a charity foundation 'Humor hilft heilen - für mehr gesundes Lachen im Krankenhaus' ('Humour helps the healing process - for more healthy laughing in hospitals'). Since September 2009 he has co-hosted the successor show of 'Die Tietjen und Dibaba' on [[Norddeutscher Rundfunk|NDR]] with Bettina Tietjen.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.quotenmeter.de/cms/?p1=n&amp;p2=36262&amp;p3= Bericht von quotenmeter.de über die neue Sendung]&lt;/ref&gt; 

Eckard von Hirschhausen has developed a cabaret routine similar to that of Ludger Stratmann, also a PhD physician and cabaret artist. They both focus on the doctor-patient relationship, while von Hirschhausen specifically points out the inability and unwillingness of professionals in his field to express themselves clearly. He also focuses on the typical routines and rituals which, when separated from the professional environment, appear comical and absurd.

==Awards==
His program ''Filetspitzen'' was awarded the '[[Garching bei München|Garchinger]] Kleinkunstpreis' ('Garching Award for minor arts') in 2001. Hirschhausen also won the '[[Garching bei München|Garchinger]] Maske' in 2000, the 'Paulaner-Solo Kabarettpreis' in 2003, the 'Jurypreis des Berliner Kleinkunstfestivals' ('Jury's Prize of the Berlin Festival of Minor Arts') and the '[[RTL Television|RTL]] Comedy Cup'. On 14 September 2004, he was awarded the '[[St. Ingbert]]er Pfanne',&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.st-ingbert.de/36_1697.htm St. Ingberter Pfanne: Die Sieger stehen fest!]'' Homepage der Stadt [[St. Ingbert]].&lt;/ref&gt; one of the most important German awards for minor arts. Hirschhausen is the current German champion of [[Magic (illusion)|magic tricks]]. He was also awarded the 2011 [[Münchhausen Prize]] at [[Bodenwerder]].

Hirschhausen was a supporter of the 'Pro Reli-Kampagne', a campaign to preserve religious education in Berlin's public schools. Berlin's voters, however, decided in a referendum in April 2009 not to keep religious education in their schools. The comedian and physician Hirschhausen was awarded the title 'Krawattenmann des Jahres 2009' ('Tie-man of the year 2009') on 3 December 2009. He received this honor from the 'Deutsche Mode Institut (DMI/Köln)' ('German Institute for Fashion, Cologne') in [[Krefeld]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rp-online.de/niederrheinsued/krefeld/nachrichten/krefeld/Eckart-von-Hirschhausen-ist-Krawattenmann-des-Jahres_aid_790959.html Eckart von Hirschhausen ist Krawattenmann des Jahres] (Zugriff am 3. Dezember 2009)&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012 he was rewarded with the [[IQ Award]].

==Family==
Eckard von Hirschhausen has been living in Berlin since he was born. His brother is the German economist Christian von Hirschhausen (born 1964).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Porträt: Aus der Klinik auf die Bühne |url=http://www.morgenpost.de/printarchiv/berlin/article961708/Aus_der_Klinik_auf_die_Buehne.html |language=German |work=[[Berliner Morgenpost]] |date=2008-10-22 |accessdate=June 19, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:SilentDrillPlatoon-1.jpg|thumb|right|The United States Marine Corps [[Silent Drill Platoon]] performs in front of the home of the Commandant of the Marine Corps.]]

'''Exhibition drill''' is a variant of drill that involves complex marching sequences which usually deviate from drill used in the course of ordinary parades. Teams performing exhibition drill are often affiliated with [[military]] units, but the scope of exhibition drill is not limited to military [[drill team]]s. Exhibition drill is often performed by Armed Forces Drill Teams, the drill teams at service academies and [[ROTC]] and [[JROTC]] units, and civilian drill teams that perform at [[parade]]s, drill meets, and half-time shows and other public venues.

==History of rifle exhibition drill==

[[File:USNARifleDrillTeam.jpg|thumb|A rifle drill team performance at the [[United States Naval Academy]]]]

The first documented performance{{cn|date=June 2016}} of exhibition drill was performed by Hadji Cheriff and filmed at what is believed to be{{by whom?|date=June 2016}} the Midway Plaisance of the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago, Illinois. The film was later copyrighted by Thomas Edison in 1899, entitled ''The Arabian Gun Twirler''.{{cn|date=June 2016}}

The performance demonstrates aerial (two {{clarify span|1½s over-hand thrown from the firing hammer|date=June 2016}}) and over-the-shoulder techniques, {{clarify span|over-the-head drill,|date=June 2016}} and {{clarify span|under-the-leg inverted spin.|date=June 2016}}

It is believed{{by whom?|date=June 2016}} that the weapon was a .577 caliber, triple band 1853 Enfield Musket, which is 56" long and weighs about 9.5 pounds and thus is 13" longer and heavier than most drill weapons used today.{{cn|date=November 2011}}

== Exhibition drill in competition ==
Exhibition drill is one of many different drill phases that are a part of a drill meet. Other phases include Inspection, Color Guard and Regulation Drill.

Exhibition military drill has grown drastically in popularity in recent decades. This growth can be attributed to several primary factors. These include:

* The expansion of Junior ROTC programs through the four primary service branches that occurred in the early and mid 1980s took the total number of units from roughly 1,600 to well over 2,500 in the U.S. This provided more cadets the opportunity to be a part of these exhibition drill teams. 
* The work of Sports Network International (SNI) produced military drill and ceremony competitions on a scale that had never previously been seen. 
* From these numerous competitions,&lt;ref&gt;http://drill.thenationals.net&lt;/ref&gt; SNI produced magazines and websites to feature this activity. SNI also produced training and entertainment videos &lt;ref&gt;http://videos.thenationals.net&lt;/ref&gt; devoted exclusively to featuring many of the military exhibition drill teams in the country. These videos allowed the talent and creativity involved in exhibition drill at the highest levels to travel and expand at a greater rate, helping to promote the sport.

'''General rules and guidelines'''

Rules of exhibition drill during [[competitions]] vary, but most of them apply the following guidelines:

Time – There is usually a minimum and maximum time a routine may take. Points are deducted if a team is under or over time.

Boundaries – Teams should be aware of their boundary lines, and if necessary, alter their routines as to not cross the boundary lines. Points are deducted if a person crosses a boundary line.

Some high-school level competitions prevent cadets who are participating in armed drill events from performing more dangerous 'over the head' spins, or raising cadets off the floor, in the interest of safety.

===High school===

Some high school drill teams compete at the National High School Drill Team Championships in Daytona Beach, Florida, and generally use demilitarized Springfield M1903s, M1 Garands, M-14 rifles and Daisy Drill Rifles. Certain teams at the NHSDTC who receive high placings end up being well known on a national level. There are also national levels for JROTC divisions nationwide. There is the Navy JROTC, Army JROTC, Marine Corps JROTC, Air Force JROTC, and much more that all have their own prospective drill nationals. For the past two years, 2017 and 2018, at Navy Nationals, the first place armed exhibition team was Green Run High School, and the runner up being Troy High School in Fullerton, California. Other countries have their own drill team competitions for teenagers.

===Unarmed===

In an unarmed division, exhibition drill may consist of intricate precision [[military marching|marching]], along with various hand movements. Modified [[Stepping (African-American)|step team]] routines are used in some competitions.

==College ROTC drill teams==

Colleges with [[Reserve Officers' Training Corps]] (ROTC) units, as well as [[Military academy|military academies]], have drill teams normally train and compete in two types of drill events: Regulation/Close Order and Exhibition (Trick or Fancy) Drill.  Regulation Drill is conducted in accordance with Field Manual 22-5 (now FM 3-21.5) Drill and Ceremonies.  Exhibition Drill is more free form and often more elaborate then Regulation Drill. Exhibition Drill teams are also more colorful in uniform and weaponry. In both types of event, participants are typically armed with weapons made safe or inert by removal of firing pins. Armament is totally devoid of all firing mechanisms for the safety of participants and audience alike.

'''[[Pershing Rifles]]''', founded in 1894, is the oldest continuously operating college organization dedicated to military drill.  The original drill team created by [[John J. Pershing]] had a simple goal: to serve as an example for the cadets at the University of Nebraska, who were sorely lacking in [[esprit de corps]], motivation, and basic military skills. For its first few years, the group (then called "Company A") did just that: its members became experts at unarmed, armed, and exhibition drill, and were soon the pride of the university. By 1894, cadets and alumni formed Varsity Rifles. By June 1895, when Pershing announced his departure from the university, the group had morphed from a simple drill team into a fraternal organization; in his honor, they renamed the group the Pershing Rifles.

As the unit grew, their reputation followed: by the early 1900s, membership was considered a high military honor. Other schools soon applied for affiliation with the Pershing Rifles. By the middle of the 20th century, this now national organization comprised nearly 200 units representing all of the services stationed at ROTC detachments around the country. Through their phenomenal growth, however, the Pershing Rifles were careful to stay true to their basic purpose: to develop the traits of leadership and discipline among their members through drill competition.

The success of Pershing Rifles' leadership development program would not have been possible without the organization's focus on close-order and exhibition rifle drill. Excellence in drill, whether armed or unarmed, is a function of discipline and dedication; these traits are put to work on a regular basis by Pershing Rifles units. A typical unit performs as a color guard, exhibition drill team, [[honor guard]], funeral detail, or any other ceremonial unit requested; these services are usually at the request of the local ROTC detachment or school, but are sometimes requested by alumni, local governments, or active duty military units. Through all of these activities, in addition to the skills gained by the performers, positive publicity is also received by the unit's host school, host ROTC detachment, and ultimately the military in general. Pershing Rifles hosts a National Drill Competition each spring which attracts some of the finest college level drill teams in the nation. 

'''Triphibian Guard''' was founded in 1959 as an Army ROTC Drill Team of [[Seton Hall University]] as a chartered and approved student organization. Cadets from the existing Pershing Rifles Company K-8 formed the Triphibian Guard. The name was chosen because it represented land, sea and air forces. Once established, the Triphibian Guard quickly grew in stature and respect at the university, becoming the official honor guard of the university president. Officer candidate student members wore a distinctive triangular [[Shoulder sleeve insignia|patch]] and [[fourragere]] (gold and black cord) on the left shoulder of their uniform. This was the [[United States Army]]'s colors, and depicted an African male lion with a gold crown on the forehead. Upon graduation, student officer graduates are eligible for the award of Distinguished Military Graduate (DMG), one of the [[awards and decorations of the United States military]], and may become a [[commissioned officer]] of the [[United States Armed Forces]].  The unit disbanded in the late 1970s due to lack of student interest at the end of the hostilities of the [[Vietnam War]].

'''[[Gator Guard Drill Team]]''' (GGDT) is a precision drill team and military fraternity based at the [[University of Florida]]. It is named after the Florida Gators, the mascot of the University of Florida. Founded in 1953, the Gator Guard absorbed and succeeded the University of Florida's Army ROTC chapter of the Pershing Rifles upon its inception. The Gator Guard performs annually at the university's [[Homecoming]] Parade, as well as the Krewe of Mid-City and King Rex parades at the [[New Orleans Mardi Gras]]. The team uses [[M1903 Springfield|M1903]] rifles with 8-inch bayonets for all performances. The Gator Guard also performs color guard ceremonies for the University of Florida, the [[Southeastern Conference|SEC]], and the [[MLB]]. 

'''Billy Mitchell Drill Team''' (BMDT), founded in 1951 as an Air Force ROTC Drill Team, is a drill, ceremony and color guard team at the University of Florida. It is open to all students of the university, but wears the United States Air Force uniform. With a history spanning six decades, BMDT's rich heritage and dedication to discipline and excellence help to produce officers for the nation's Air Force, Army, Navy, and Marine Corps.

==Civilian drill teams==

'''King's Village Guard''' of Hawaii is more commonly known as the King's Guard.  They were founded in the 1960s and perform weekly shows in Hawaii. They have also performed several times at the National High School Drill Team Championships in Daytona, Florida. They use a modified Springfield M1903 rifle.

'''New Guard America''' was founded in 1997 by Constantine H. Wilson. This is the world's only internationally touring civilian drill team.  They use Springfield M1903 rifles with fixed {{convert|10|in|mm|adj=on}} bayonets. They are based out of the Washington, DC metropolitan area.  They perform mainly in four man-blocks.  In June 2008 they performed at the Norwegian [[Military Tattoo]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.normiltatto.no/{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; in Oslo, Norway, making them the first civilian drill team to perform at an international tattoo.

'''Hawaii Royal Honor Guard''', formerly the Hilton Hawaiian Village Guards, was established in 1989 by Commander Adam Marumoto and is currently under the direction of Executive Officer Christopher Koanui. It was originally intended to perform for the Hilton Hawaiian Villages events and shows on the property, as well as elsewhere.  As of 2009 the Hilton Hawaiian Village Guards adopted their new title as the Hawaii Royal Honor Guard, and now perform at private events for various clients. The HRHG'S members have numerous championship titles which range from the national championships and the Isis world championships beginning in 1989. The HRHG currently perform private shows at the Historic Royal Hawaiian Hotel. They contribute to Hawaii's tradition of training youth and young adults in the art of one of Hawaii's unique styles of exhibition drill.

'''Fubarite''' is an informal name and [[in-joke]] in [[geology]] for any [[rock (geology)|rock]] that has been severely [[breccia]]ted and [[metamorphism|metamorphosed]] to the point that it is difficult or impossible to determine its origin.&lt;ref&gt;[http://forums.randi.org/showthread.php?p=2505532 Sandstone - Page 6 - JREF Forum&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://dml.cmnh.org/1999Oct/msg00319.html Schist&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://coding.derkeiler.com/Archive/Delphi/borland.public.delphi.non-technical/2005-05/msg06378.html Re: Delphi 7 Pro.

The name is a [[word play]] with the acronym [[List of military slang terms#FUBAR|FUBAR]], which means "fucked up beyond all recognition".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A Field Guide to Gold, Gemstone and Mineral Sites of British Columbia |date=1999 |publisher=Orca Book Publishers |page=7 |first1=Richard Dennis |last1=Hudson |first2=Richard |last2=Hudson |first3=Rick |last3=Hudson |quote=The change can be small (slate is simply shale that has been cooked for a few millennia), or it can be so dramatic you can't tell what the original material was (sometimes known as fubarite = “fudged up beyond all recognition”)!}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Funimation Productions, LLC'''&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ftc.gov/enforcement/premerger-notification-program/early-termination-notices/20171784 20171784: Sony Corporation; FUNimation Holdings, LLC] FTC&lt;/ref&gt; (commonly known as '''Funimation''') is an American [[entertainment industry|entertainment company]] that specializes in the dubbing and distribution of foreign content, most notably [[anime]]. [[Sony Pictures|Sony Pictures Entertainment]], a division of the Japanese conglomerate [[Sony]], is its majority owner. Based in [[Flower Mound, Texas]], the studio is one of the leading distributors of anime and other foreign entertainment properties in North America alongside [[Viz Media]], [[Sentai Filmworks]], [[Aniplex of America]], and more. Their most popular property is [[Toei Animation]]'s action-adventure franchise ''[[Dragon Ball]]'', which - through its sequel ''[[Dragon Ball Z]]'' - had a successful run on [[Cartoon Network]]'s [[Toonami]] block from 1998 to 2003, and has been re-released on DVD and Blu-ray several times since.

The company was founded on May 9, 1994 by [[Gen Fukunaga]] and his wife Cindy as FUNimation Productions, with funding by Daniel Cocanougher and his family, who became investors in the company. Funimation was sold to [[Navarre Corporation]] on May 11, 2005 and the company was renamed FUNimation Entertainment.

In April 2011, Navarre sold Funimation to a group of investors including Fukunaga (and John A. Kuelbs) for $24 million.&lt;ref name="Sale"&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.tradershuddle.com/20110404196448/globenewswire/Navarre-Corporation-Announces-Sale-of-FUNimation-Entertainment.html |publisher=GLOBE NEWSWIRE |title=Navarre Corporation Announces Sale Of FUNimation Entertainment |date=April 4, 2011 |accessdate=April 4, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110407020523/http://www.tradershuddle.com/20110404196448/globenewswire/Navarre-Corporation-Announces-Sale-of-FUNimation-Entertainment.html |archivedate=April 7, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Around the same time, the company's trademark ball, star and blue bar were dropped from its logo and the company was renamed to simply Funimation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://asiapacificarts.usc.edu/article@apa?navarre_sells_anime_studio_funimation_16622.aspx | title = Navarre Sells Anime Studio FUNimation | publisher = Asia Pacific Arts | date = April 8, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2013, Funimation consolidated its divisions under its new holding company Group 1200 Media. Kuelbs became Chairman of Funimation/Group 1200 after the acquisition from Navarre. Kuelbs and Fukunaga continued to make additional investments into Funimation. A new senior management was brought on and a multi-year distribution deal was announced with [[Universal Pictures Home Entertainment]]. In January 2016 FunimationNow, a new ad free HD anime streaming service with Sony subscription, was announced at the CES show in Las Vegas. On July 31, 2017, [[Sony Pictures Television]] announced plans to acquire a 95% stake in Funimation for $143 million while Gen Fukunaga would retain his position with a 5% share.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2017-07-31/sony-pictures-tv-to-acquire-majority-stake-in-funimation/.119575|title=Sony Pictures TV to Acquire Majority Stake in Funimation|website=[[Anime News Network]]|accessdate=August 1, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://www.sonypictures.com/corp/press_releases/2017/07_17/073117_funimation.html|title=SONY PICTURES TELEVISION NETWORKS TO ACQUIRE SUBSTANTIAL MAJORITY STAKE IN FUNIMATION|date=July 31, 2017|website=Sony Pictures|accessdate=August 2, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The deal was closed on October 27, 2017.

Funimation is a [[portmanteau]] of the [[English language|English]] words "fun" and "animation". From 2016 to 2018, Funimation had a partnership agreement with [[Crunchyroll]].&lt;ref name="FUNi-roll Partnership"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2016-09-08/crunchyroll-funimation-announce-partnership-to-share-content-via-streaming-home-video-est/.106234|title=Crunchyroll, Funimation Announce Partnership to Share Content Via Streaming, Home Video, Est.|publisher=[[Anime News Network]]|date=September 8, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://variety.com/2018/digital/news/funimation-ends-crunchyroll-anime-licensing-deal-sony-1202984211/|title=Sony’s Funimation Ends Anime Licensing Pact With Crunchyroll|last=Spangler|first=Todd|date=2018-10-18|work=Variety|access-date=2018-10-18|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Funimation Old Logo.png|thumb|The original Funimation logo used from 1994 to 2005]]
The company was founded on June 14, 1994 by Japanese-born businessman [[Gen Fukunaga]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.icv2.com/articles/news/6036.html |title=Interview with Gen Fukunaga, Part 1 |publisher=ICv2 |date=November 1, 2004 |accessdate=February 8, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Fukunaga's uncle, Nagafumi Hori, was working as a producer for [[Toei Company]]; Hori approached Gen about licensing ''[[Dragon Ball]]'' to the United States. He proposed that if Fukunaga could start a production company and raise enough money, [[Toei Animation]] would license the rights to the franchise. Fukunaga met with co-worker Daniel Cocanougher whose family owned a feed mill in [[Decatur, Texas]] and convinced Cocanougher's family to sell their business and serve as an investor for his company. The company was originally formed in [[Silicon Valley, California]] as Funimation Productions in 1994, but eventually relocated to [[Flower Mound, Texas]], located near [[Fort Worth, Texas|Fort Worth]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.practicemakesawesome.com/animerica-magazine-anime-3x3-eyes-sailor-moon-dragon-ball-tv-edit-volume-3-issue-10-october-1995/ |title=Animerica October 1995 - Sailor Moon Dragon Ball TV Edit News &amp; scans |publisher=Practicemakesawesome.com |date=May 13, 2012 |accessdate=August 13, 2012 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203205129/http://www.practicemakesawesome.com/animerica-magazine-anime-3x3-eyes-sailor-moon-dragon-ball-tv-edit-streamline-pictures-softcel-volume-3-issue-10-october-1995/ |archivedate=December 3, 2013 |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; They initially collaborated with other companies on ''Dragon Ball'', such as BLT Productions, [[Ocean Productions|Ocean Studios]], [[NBCUniversal Entertainment Japan|Pioneer]] and [[Saban Entertainment]]. By 1998, after two aborted attempts to bring the ''Dragon Ball'' franchise to a U.S. audience via [[first-run syndication]], it finally found success on [[Cartoon Network]]'s action-oriented programming block [[Toonami]], and the ''Dragon Ball'' phenomenon quickly grew in the United States as it had elsewhere. This led Funimation to begin licensing other anime to the U.S.

Starting in September 2003, Funimation, along with British company Maverick, has distributed titles from Canada-based [[Nelvana]], including ''[[Redwall (TV series)|Redwall]]'', ''[[Pecola]]'', ''[[Tales from the Cryptkeeper]]'', ''[[Timothy Goes to School]]'' and the [[Disney Channel]] TV special ''[[The Santa Claus Brothers]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Ball, Ryan (September 25, 2003). [http://www.animationmagazine.net/article.php?article_id=1570 "Nelvana Home Entertainment Launched"]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Purchase by Navarre Corporation===
On May 11, 2005, Funimation was acquired by the now-defunct [[Navarre Corporation]] for [[United States dollar|US$]]100.4 million in cash and 1.8 million shares of Navarre stock. As part of the acquisition, the president Fukunaga was retained as head of the company, transitioning to the position of CEO, and the company's name was changed from Funimation Productions to Funimation Entertainment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |url=http://ir.navarre.com/phoenix.zhtml?c=105157&amp;p=irol-newsArticle&amp;ID=709018&amp;highlight= |publisher=Navarre Corporation |title=Navarre Corporation Acquires Funimation, and Provides Financial Update and Guidance |date=May 11, 2005 |accessdate=July 8, 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120710044610/http://ir.navarre.com/phoenix.zhtml?c=105157&amp;p=irol-newsArticle&amp;ID=709018&amp;highlight= |archivedate=July 10, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |url=http://www.icv2.com/articles/news/6866.html |publisher=ICv2 |title=Navarre Completes Funimation Acquisition |date=May 12, 2005 |accessdate=February 8, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, Funimation moved from [[North Richland Hills, Texas]] to Flower Mound; the standalone Flower Mound facility has double the square footage of the space Funimation occupied previous North Richland Hills facility; in the North Richland Hills facility Funimation shared the building with other tenants.&lt;ref name="Move"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-30963771_ITM |publisher=Fort-Worth Star Telegram |title=Funimation moving headquarters to Flower Mound |date=June 7, 2007 |accessdate=June 7, 2007 | first=David | last=Wethe}}&lt;/ref&gt; Funimation moved into the Lakeside Business District with a ten-year lease.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.flower-mound.com/econdev/articles/FUNimationEntertainmentscriptsHQmove.pdf |work=Dallas Business Journal |title=FUNimation Entertainment scripts HQ move |date=June 8, 2007 |accessdate=June 20, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Acquisition of Geneon and ADV licenses and online streaming===
According to an interview in February 2008 with Navarre Corporation CEO Cary Deacon, Funimation was in early stage negotiations to acquire some of the titles licensed through [[Geneon Universal Entertainment|Geneon]]'s USA division, which ceased operations in December 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.icv2.com/articles/home/12043.html |publisher=ICv2 |title=Navarre/FUNimation Interested in Some Geneon Titles |date=February 8, 2008 |accessdate=February 8, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2008, Funimation confirmed that they had acquired distribution rights to several Geneon titles, including some that Geneon had left unfinished when they ceased operations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |url=http://funimation.com/f_index.cfm?page=news&amp;id=454 |publisher=funimation.com |title=FUNimation Entertainment and Geneon Entertainment Sign Exclusive Distribution Agreement for North America |date=July 3, 2008 |accessdate=July 3, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080707102907/http://www.funimation.com/f_index.cfm?page=news&amp;id=454 |archivedate=July 7, 2008 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

At [[Anime Expo]] 2008, Funimation announced that it had acquired over 30 titles from the [[Sojitz]] catalog that had previously been licensed by [[ADV Films]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2008-07-04/funimation-picks-up-over-30-former-ad-vision-titles |publisher=animenewsnetwork.com |title=Funimation Picks Up Over 30 Former AD Vision Titles |date=July 4, 2008 |accessdate=July 4, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, Funimation signed a deal with [[Toei Animation]] to stream several of its anime titles online through the Funimation website and [[Hulu]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2009-04-03/funimation-adds-toei-air-master-captain-harlock |title=Funimation Adds Toei's Air Master, Captain Harlock  |publisher=Anime News Network |date=April 3, 2009 |accessdate=August 13, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sale from Navarre, Nico Nico partnership and distribution deal===
In the first quarter of 2010, Navarre Corporation reclassified Funimation as "discounted operations" and began preparations to sell the company.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:Y261YdJWUacJ:phx.corporate-ir.net/External.File%253Fitem%253DUGFyZW50SUQ9MTAzMTU2fENoaWxkSUQ9LTF8VHlwZT0z%2526t%253D1+&amp;cd=8&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;gl=us&amp;client=ubuntu|title=Annual Report 2011|website=webcache.googleusercontent.com|access-date=2017-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Navarre released a statement in April 2011 confirming that Funimation has been sold to a group of investors, including original owner Gen Fukunaga, for $24 million.&lt;ref name="Sale"/&gt; It is speculated that Funimation was sold at such a low cost (in comparison to how much it was originally purchased for, almost $100 million in cash and $15 million in stock in 2005) because Navarre wanted to continue distributing goods in relation to the products, but not handle the publishing. Navarre remained as exclusive distributor of Funimation's titles until 2013 when the company shutdown.

On October 14, 2011, Funimation announced a permanent partnership with Niconico, the English-language version of ''[[Niconico|Nico Nico Douga]]'', to form the 'Funico' brand for the licensing of anime for streaming and home video release. From this point on, virtually all titles simulcasted by Niconico were acquired by Funimation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2011-10-14/funimation-niconico-to-jointly-license-anime |title=Funimation, Niconico to Jointly License Anime|publisher=Anime News Network |date=October 14, 2011 |accessdate=August 13, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The deal has since been severed.

[[File:Funimation Logo.svg|250px|thumb|right|upright|Funimation logo from May 11, 2005 to January 7, 2016. The colored version was used until April 2011.]]
On June 22, 2015, Funimation and [[Universal Pictures Home Entertainment]] announced a multi-year home video distribution deal. The deal will allow UPHE to manage distribution and sales of Funimation's catalog of titles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/funimation-and-universal-pictures-home-entertainment-enter-into-multi-year-distribution-agreement-300103173.html|title=Funimation and Universal Pictures Home Entertainment Enter Into Multi-Year Distribution Agreement|agency=PR Newswire|date=June 22, 2015|accessdate=June 22, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Universal began distributing Funimation's titles in October of that year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fandompost.com/2015/07/17/funimation-reveals-first-october-2015-anime-releases/|title=FUNimation Reveals (First?)

===FunimationNow and partnership with Crunchyroll===
In January 2016, Funimation announced a new streaming service, FunimationNow, along with a new logo. The service also is available in the UK and Ireland, the first time the company has expanded beyond North America.{{Citation needed|date=December 2017}}

On September 8, 2016, Funimation announced a partnership with [[Crunchyroll]].&lt;ref name="FUNi-roll Partnership"/&gt; Select Funimation titles will be streamed subtitled on Crunchyroll and select Crunchyroll titles will be streamed on FunimationNow, including upcoming dubbed content. In addition, Funimation and Universal will act as distributors for Crunchyroll's home video catalog.

On May 18, 2017, [[Shout! Factory]] acquired the North American distribution rights to ''[[In This Corner of the World (film)|In This Corner of the World]]'', with a U.S. theatrical release to take place in August 11, 2017, co-released by Funimation Films.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=McNary|first1=Dave|title=Japanese Animated Film ‘In This Corner of the World’ Scheduled for August Release|url=https://variety.com/2017/film/news/japan-animated-in-this-corner-of-the-world-1202431532/|website=Variety|accessdate=June 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Acquisition by Sony Pictures ===
In May 2017, it was reported that [[Universal Studios]] and [[Sony Pictures|Sony Pictures Entertainment]] were interested in purchasing Funimation; however, Universal decided not to proceed with the bidding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-05-04/-dragon-ball-importer-funimation-said-to-tempt-universal-sony|title=Universal and Sony Are Eyeing ‘Dragon Ball' Importer Funimation|last=Sakoui|first=Anousha|work=Bloomberg|date=May 4, 2017|accessdate=August 4, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; On July 31, 2017, [[Sony Pictures Television]] announced that it would buy a controlling 95% stake in Funimation for $143 million, a deal that was approved by the [[United States Department of Justice]] on August 22, 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Eggerton|first1=John|title=Feds OK Sony Purchase of Funimation|url=http://www.multichannel.com/news/policy/feds-ok-sony-purchase-funimation/414752|website=Multichannel|accessdate=27 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; This deal allows Funimation to have synergies with Sony's [[Animax]] and [[Kids Station]] divisions and "direct access to the creative pipeline".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://deadline.com/2017/07/sony-pictures-tv-networks-acquires-majority-stake-funimation-japanese-anime-1202139652/|title=Sony Pictures TV Networks To Acquire Majority Stake in Funimation|last=Petski|first=Denise|date=July 31, 2017|publisher=Deadline Hollywood|access-date=August 1, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The deal was closed on October 27, 2017.

On February 16, 2018, it was reported that [[Shout! Factory]]'s Shout! Studios division acquired the U.S/Canadian distribution rights to ''[[Big Fish &amp; Begonia]]'' and partnered with Funimation Films again for distribution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2018/film/asia/chinese-animation-big-fish-begonia-april-u-s-release-1202702010/|last=Frater|first=Patrick|title=Chinese Animation ‘Big Fish &amp; Begonia’ Set for April U.S. Release|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|publisher=[[Penske Business Media]]|date=February 16, 2018|accessdate=May 14, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 12, 2018, it was announced that Funimation Films had picked up licensing rights for ''[[Dragon Ball Super: Broly]]'' in [[North America]] and that its English dub would premiere in theaters sometime in January 2019 in the [[United States]] and [[Canada]], only around a month after its national premiere in Japan.&lt;ref name="English dub"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2018/07/12/funimation-is-bringing-dragon-ball-super-broly-to-north-american-theaters-in-2019|title=Funimation Is Bringing Dragon Ball Super: Broly to North American Theaters in 2019|work=IGN|date=Jul 12, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2018, [[WarnerMedia]] fully acquired [[Otter Media]], owner of Crunchyroll. On October 18, 2018, Funimation and Sony Pictures announced that their partnership with Crunchyroll will end on November 9, 2018. Despite the home video releases being unaffected and still going on as planned, select Funimation content will be removed from Crunchyroll, and subtitled content will return to FunimationNow. Also, Funimation will be removed from Otter Media-owned streaming service [[VRV (streaming service)|VRV]] entirely, being replaced by [[Hidive]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Spangler|first=John|title=Sony’s Funimation Ends Anime Licensing Pact With Crunchyroll|url=https://variety.com/2018/digital/news/funimation-ends-crunchyroll-anime-licensing-deal-sony-1202984211/|website=Variety|accessdate=October 18, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal actions==

===Anti-piracy===
In 2005, Funimation's legal department began to pursue a more aggressive approach toward protecting the company's licensed properties. Then started sending "cease and desist" (C&amp;D) letters to sites offering links to [[fansubbing|fansubs]] of their titles. This move was similar to that taken by the now-defunct [[A.D. Vision#ADV Films|ADV Films]] several years before with several of the major torrent sites.{{Citation needed|date=December 2017}}

Funimation's legal department served C&amp;D letters for series that had not yet been advertised or announced as licensed, including ''[[Tsubasa: Reservoir Chronicle]]'', ''[[Black Cat (manga)|Black Cat]]'', and ''[[SoltyRei]]'', with a few known series also mentioned in the letter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/article.php?id=7979 |title=Funimation Enforces Intellectual Property Rights (ANN) | accessdate=October 14, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Funimation revealed more licenses on October 6, 2006 when it sent letters to torrent sites demanding that distribution of ''[[xxxHolic]]'''s TV series, ''[[Mushishi]]'', ''[[Ragnarok the Animation]]'', and other series cease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/article.php?id=9625|title=Funimation Sends out Cease &amp; Desist Letters For Multiple Anime (ANN)| accessdate=October 14, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since October 2009, Funimation has routinely filed [[Digital Millennium Copyright Act|DMCA]] [[notice and take down|takedown notice]]s to get unauthorized distributions of its and its partners' properties removed from [[Google]] search results.&lt;ref group=notes&gt;As of October 2012, the Chilling Effects search engine is broken, but Google search results for ''site:chillingeffects.org funimation'' reveal the DMCA notices received and processed so far.&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2011, Funimation filed a lawsuit against [[BitTorrent]] users in the U.S. for allegedly downloading and uploading ''[[One Piece]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/interview/2011-05-09/interview-evan-stone|title=Interview: Evan Stone|publisher=Anime News Network|date=May 9, 2011|last=Manry|first=Gia|accessdate=October 19, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Funimation dropped the suit in March after a [[United States District Court for the Northern District of Texas|Northern Texas]] judge, having already indicated that the court would appoint attorneys for the defendants,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2011/02/dont-mess-texas-another-texas-judge-scrutinizes|title=Don't Mess With Texas: Another Texas Judge Scrutinizes Mass Copyright Litigation|last=McSherry|first=Corynne|date=February 15, 2011|accessdate=October 19, 2012|publisher=[[Electronic Frontier Foundation|EFF]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; ruled that the defendants were not "acting in concert" and thus couldn't be sued as a group; each would have to be sued separately.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2011-03-24/funimation-dismisses-its-one-piece-bittorrent-lawsuit|title=Funimation Dismisses Its One Piece BitTorrent Lawsuit|date=March 24, 2011|accessdate=October 19, 2012|publisher=Anime News Network}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''One Piece'' film at issue was a [[fansub]], an unauthorized copy distributed with fan-produced, translated subtitles. Soon after the lawsuit was abandoned, Funimation was reported to have long been deriving dubs from fansubs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2011-03-22/downloaded-sora-no-otoshimono-copy-shown-at-funimation-studio|title=Downloaded Sora no Otoshimono Copy Shown at Funimation Studio|date=March 22, 2011|accessdate=October 19, 2012|publisher=Anime News Network}}&lt;/ref&gt; Funimation nevertheless maintains that fansubbing is harmful to the anime industry, stating "The practices of illegal downloads and 'fansubbing' are very harmful to our Japanese partners and [...] we have been asked to monitor and take action against unauthorized distribution of these titles. Because we believe that this will benefit the industry, we have agreed to do so."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2008-08-11/3-titles-fansubs-pulled-on-behalf-of-japan-d-rights|title=3 Titles' Fansubs Pulled on Behalf of Japan's d-rights|date=August 18, 2008|accessdate=October 19, 2012|publisher=Anime News Network}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sites which distribute fansubs or separate fan-created subtitles remain a frequent target of civil actions by Funimation and other anime companies, as well as criminal prosecution in at least one case.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://torrentfreak.com/student-fined-for-running-movie-tv-show-subtitle-download-site-120608/|title=Student Fined For Running Movie &amp; TV Show Subtitle Download Site|date=June 8, 2012|accessdate=October 19, 2012|author=Enigmax|publisher=TorrentFreak}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two months after the failure to sue BitTorrent users in the North Texas district, Funimation engaged in [[forum shopping]] and proceeded to sue 1,427 defendants in the neighboring East Texas district for acting "in concert" to infringe copyright on ''[[The Legend Is Born: Ip Man]]''. This case was allowed to proceed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.recapthelaw.org/txed/130378/|title=The RECAP Archive: FUNimation Entertainment v.

===Disputes with partners===
In November 2011, Funimation sued [[A.D. Vision]], AEsir Holdings, [[Section23 Films]], Valkyrie Media Partners, [[Seraphim Digital|Seraphim Studios]], [[Sentai Filmworks]] and its CEO, [[John Ledford]] and Switchblade Pictures for a sum of $8 million, citing "[[breach of contract]]s" and other issues. Funimation said that ADV's transfer of assets were made with "the intent to defer, hinder or defraud the creditors of ADV [Films]." Funimation sought ADV's sale of assets as void.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2012-01-13/funimation-sues-a.d-vision-sentai-others-for-us$8-million|title=Funimation Sues A.D.

==Foreign distribution==
Funimation does not directly release its properties in non-North American (English language-speaking) markets, instead sublicensing to other companies such as [[Manga Entertainment]] until it was transferred in 2015 to [[Anime Limited]] in the United Kingdom and [[Madman Entertainment]] in Australia and New Zealand, Melanesia Region (PNG, Solomon Islands, Fiji). Funimation's former UK outlets include [[Revelation Films]] and [[MVM Films]]. Funimation has also attempted to distribute ''Dragon Ball Z'' to Spanish speaking audiences, and has released a number of Spanish-language DVDs of the series.{{Citation needed|date=December 2017}}

==Funimation Channel==
Funimation Entertainment, along with Olympusat, launched the [[Funimation Channel]] in September 2005, the second 24-hour anime digital cable network in North America (the first being [[A.D. Vision]]'s [[Anime Network]]). Olympusat was the exclusive distributor of the channel.

When the channel first launched, it was available to a few cities via UHF digital signals.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mania.com/navarres-funimation-entertainment-announces-launch-funimation-channel-seattle_article_85177.html service on UHF signals]&lt;/ref&gt; The service was temporary as the channel was trying to gain a foothold in the already crowded digital cable landscape. Another short-term service was the syndication of a Funimation Channel block to one of OlympuSAT's affiliate networks –  Colours TV.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.redorbit.com/news/technology/648247/navarres_funimation_entertainment_doubles_anime_programming_for_syndicated_anime_block/index.html syndicated block]&lt;/ref&gt; Both services were discontinued in favor for a more successful expansion on digital cable, fiber optics and DBS systems.  The channel launched its HD feed on September 27, 2010. On December 31, 2015, Funimation &amp; Olympusat ended their deal and no longer broadcasts Funimation titles on the channel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/funimation-reveals-plans-for-new-cable-channel-300192374.html|title=FUNimation Reveals Plans for New Cable Channel|agency=[[PR Newswire]]|type=Press Release|date=December 14, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The channel relaunched as [[Toku (TV network)|Toku]], while Funimation announced plans to relaunch Funimation Channel in 2016.

Back in 2007, Funimation Entertainment licensed ''[[Adolescence of Utena|Revolutionary Girl Utena: The Movie]]'', the ''[[Record of Lodoss War]]'' series, ''[[Roujin Z]]'', the ''[[Project A-ko]]'' series, ''[[Urusei Yatsura 2: Beautiful Dreamer|Urusei Yatsura: Beautiful Dreamer]]'' and ''[[Grave of the Fireflies]]''  from [[Central Park Media]] and played them on the Funimation Channel on television in the [[United States]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/press-release/2007-04-10/funimation-channel-adds-anime-from-central-park-media|title=Funimation Entertainment has licensed several titles from the Central Park Media library for playing on the Funimation Channel on TV in the USA only.|website=Anime News Network}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Central Park Media filed for chapter 7 bankruptcy in 2009, and Grave of the Fireflies had its North American rights acquired by ADV Films, who made the film their own title and then made it have its own North American VOD debut on Anime Network but later shut down as well, the same year after that. http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2009-04-28/central-park-media-files-for-chapter-7-bankruptcy (Central Park Media Files for Chapter 7 Bankruptcy) &amp; http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2009-05-05/adv-adds-grave-of-the-fireflies-now-and-then-here-and-there (ADV Films Adds Grave of the Fireflies, Now and Then, Here and There&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Although Anime Network has never aired Grave of the Fireflies on TV in the United States and Canada, when the film was licensed by ADV Films then Sentai Filmworks, since the discontinuation of the 24/7 linear service that occurred 7 years ago, on January 1, 2008, it streamed the film on VOD in the 2 countries.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, they licensed ''[[Buso Renkin]]'', ''[[Honey and Clover]]'', ''[[Hunter × Hunter]]'', ''[[Nana (manga)|Nana]]'' and ''[[Monster (manga)|Monster]]'' from [[Viz Media]] (their fellow rival) for the channel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/press-release/2009-04-16/viz-media-licenses-five-top-animated-series-to-funimation-channel-for-us-television-launch|title=Funimation Entertainment has licensed 5 titles from the Viz Media library for playing on the Funimation Channel in the USA only.|website=Anime News Network}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2009-10-12/monster-anime-premieres-on-syfy-ani-monday-tonight|title=Monster aired on Syfy's Ani-Mondays block, then on Chiller.

The only title licensed for Funimation Channel which was not licensed by Funimation, neither Viz Media, nor Nozomi Entertainment or Central Park Media was ''[[Haré+Guu]]'', which was licensed for North American distribution by [[AnimeNation#AN Entertainment|AN Entertainment]] and [[Bang Zoom! Entertainment]] and had its North American DVD release published by Funimation, while its licensors were the producers. The only [[Enoki Films|Enoki USA]] titles Funimation licensed for Funimation Channel were ''[[Revolutionary Girl Utena]]'' and ''[[Kare Kano|His and Her Circumstances]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.icv2.com/articles/news/9665.html|title=FUNimation to Play 2 Enoki Films USA Titles On FUNimation Channel|publisher=icv2.com|accessdate=October 25, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Alternative distribution==
In July 2008, Funimation and [[Red Planet Media]] announced the launch of a mobile [[video-on-demand]] service for [[AT&amp;T Mobility]] and [[Sprint Nextel|Sprint]] mobile phone subscribers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/press-release/2008-07-09/full-seasons-of-the-best-anime-from-funimation-channel-launch-on-jumpinmobile.tv-the-new-mobile-video-on-demand-service-from-red-planet-media |title=Full Seasons of the Best Anime from FUNimation Channel Launch on JumpInMobile.TV – The New Mobile Video-on-Demand Service from Red Planet Media |publisher=[[Anime News Network]] |date=July 9, 2008 |accessdate=July 9, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Three titles were part of the launch,  ''[[Gunslinger Girl]]'', ''[[Tsukuyomi: Moon Phase]]'', and ''[[The Galaxy Railways]]'', with entire seasons of each made available.

On September 19, 2006, Funimation created an official channel on [[YouTube]] where they upload advertisements for box sets, as well as clips and preview episodes of their licensed series. In September 2008, they began distributing full episodes of series on [[Hulu]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2008-09-23/hulu-website-launches-channel-for-free-legal-anime|title=Hulu.com Launches Channel for Free, Legal Anime Streams (Update 2)|accessdate=December 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December of the same year, Funimation added a video section to their main website with preview episodes of various series.

For the anime ''[[Space Dandy]]'', Funimation dubbed episodes and broadcast them on [[Adult Swim]]'s [[Toonami]] block a day earlier than the "original" Japanese broadcast. After the method gained success, Funimation announced in October 2014 a "broadcast dubs" program, which would be exclusive to subscribers on their website. For the anime series, getting "broadcast dubs" confirms that the anime series will get USA home video releases from Funimation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/anncast/2015-10-02/.93694|title=ANNCast - A Funi Feeling|accessdate=December 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;   These dubs are based on the broadcast versions of select licensed shows currently airing, which may include censorship depending on how it was originally aired, and differs from the final dubbed version included on home video releases on a case-by-case basis. The program first began with broadcast dub versions of ''[[Psycho-Pass|Psycho-Pass 2]]'' and ''[[Laughing Under the Clouds]]'', episodes of which were streamed roughly a month following their original Japanese broadcast.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2014-10-29/funimation-dubs-psycho-pass-2-laughing-under-the-clouds-anime-as-they-air-in-japan/.80475|title=Funimation Dubs Psycho-Pass 2, Laughing Under the Clouds Anime as They Air in Japan|accessdate=December 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Gangulybros01.jpg|thumb|right|260px|The Ganguly brothers – [[Anoop Kumar]], [[Ashok Kumar]] and [[Kishore Kumar]] (left to right) – with their mother]]
In a [[Bollywood]] film industry dominated by [[List of Hindi film clans|powerhouse families]] the '''Ganguly brothers''' and their family connections serve as an important bridge between the clans'''.'''

== Brief history of the Ganguly family ==
The Ganguly family are a family of film personalities active in the Hindi film industry. The family comprises the descendants of three brothers - [[Ashok Kumar|Ashok Kumar Ganguly]], [[Anoop Kumar|Anoop Kumar Ganguly]] and [[Kishore Kumar|Kishore Kumar Ganguly]] - and their sister Sati Rani Mukherkjee.

Mamta ki chhaon mein (1990)
The history of the Ganguly family begins with [[Kunjalal Ganguly]], an advocate by profession coming from a long line of lawyers,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.screenindia.com/fullstory.php?content_id=6805 Breaking Barriers from Screen Weekly, 12 December 2003 (retrieved: 2007-19-05)]&lt;/ref&gt; and his wife Gouri Rani Devi, the grand-daughter of Raja Shibchandra Banerjee and sister of classical singer Dhananjay Banerjee. The celebrated brothers and their sister, who gave birth to the Mukherjee's of Bollywood, were born to these two. Supposedly, Kishore Kumar inherited his sense of comedy from Kunjalal. Also, the most popular film featuring all three Ganguly brothers – ''[[Chalti Ka Naam Gaadi]]'' – was, supposedly, inspired by Kunjalal's Chrysler&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.screenindia.com/fullstory.php?content_id=10964 Through the Looking Glass, ''Screen Weekly'', 12 August 2005 (retrieved: 2007-19-05)]&lt;/ref&gt; that he bought in 1928, a year before the birth of his youngest son.

If [[Rattan Bai]] from their extended family network is ignored, Ashok Kumar was the first person in the family to go into the film industry. His daughter [[Preeti Ganguly]], son-in-law [[Deven Verma]] (married to his elder daughter Rupa Ganguly)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Deven Verma at a musical do|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2011-05-26/bollywood/29582249_1_musical-night-food-and-drinks-picture |publisher=[[The Times of India]] |date=26 May 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and granddaughter [[Anuradha Patel]] also became accomplished actors. Ashok Kumar's son Arun Ganguly never joined the film industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=A legacy lives on  |url=http://www.hindu.com/2000/07/28/stories/09280225.htm |publisher=[[The Hindu]] |date=28 July 2000 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Kishore Kumar's wives==
[[Kishore Kumar]] was married to [[Ruma Guha Thakurta]] (1950–58), [[Madhubala]] (1960–69), [[Yogeeta Bali]] (1975–78) and [[Leena Chandavarkar]] (1980–87).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/entertainment/hindi/bollywood/news/In-Bollywood-everyones-related/articleshow/4654411.cms?|title=The Times of IndiaBollywood The Times of India Advanced Search » HomeHindi Entertainment BollywoodMovie ReviewMusicTop 10TheatreSpecialsEvents Beauty PageantsPhotosVideos NewsPreviewsDid you Know ?Box OfficeSpecialsCeleb Blogs You are here: Home » Entertainment » Hindi » Bollywood TRENDING NOW:57th Grammy Awards: WinnersIndian artists win GrammysBigg Boss 8Aditya ChopraBAFTA Awards 2015: Winners In Bollywood, everyone's related!|author1=Anuradha Varma|date=14 June 2009|accessdate=9 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Ashok Kumar : his life and times|last1=Ghosh|first1=Nabendu|date=1995|publisher=Indus|isbn=9788172232184|location=New Delhi}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ruma (now, [[Ruma Guha Thakurta]]) was the daughter of [[Satyen Ghosh]] (better known as Montey Ghosh) and a niece to Smt. Bijoya Roy, the wife of the legendary film director [[Satyajit Ray]] (son of writer [[Sukumar Ray]] and grandson of writer and publisher [[Upendrakishore Raychowdhury]]). Her mother Sati Devi, a talented singer, was the elder sister of Bijoya, the legendary director's wife. [[Amit Kumar]], her son with Kishore Kumar eventually became a celebrity in his own right. Amit later sang duets with Krishna Mukherjee, a niece to his paternal aunt Satirani.

Yogeeta was a niece to [[Geeta Bali]], who in turn was [[Shammi Kapoor]]'s first wife. Kishore's second son Sumit Kumar was born to Leena and is also a singer. Ruma later married Arup Guha Thakurta and had a son, Ayan, and a daughter, Sromana, with him. Shammi Kapoor, a scion of the [[Kapoor Family (film)|Kapoor family]] and Geeta Bali's daughter Kanchan Desai got married to Ketan Desai, son of director [[Manmohan Desai]], who was engaged to actress [[Nanda (actress)|Nanda]] (actor-director [[Master Vinayak]]'s daughter) before his death.

Yogeeta eventually divorced Kishore Kumar and married [[Mithun Chakravorty]], who married [[Sridevi]] for a brief stint.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.telegraphindia.com/1050304/asp/etc/story_4440550.asp The news on the Telegraph]&lt;/ref&gt; Sridevi later married producer [[Surinder Kapoor]]'s son [[Boney Kapoor]], a producer who has two famous actors for brothers – [[Anil Kapoor]] and [[Sanjay Kapoor]]. Surinder, on the other hand, began his career as Geeta Bali's secretary. His only daughter, Reena, is married to showbiz tycoon Sandeep Marwah. Satyajit and Bijoya's son [[Sandip Ray]] is an accomplished film director.

==Sati Devi==
The only sister of the famous Ganguly brothers, Sati Devi, was married to [[Sashadhar Mukherjee]] (brother of [[Ravindramohan Mukherjee]], [[Subodh Mukherjee]] and [[Prabodh Mukherjee]]) of the [[Mukherjee-Samarth family (film)|Mukherjee-Samarth family]]. She gave birth to director &amp; composer [[Rono Mukherjee]] (father of actress [[Sharbani Mukherjee]]), actors [[Joy Mukherjee]] (father of actor [[Boy Mukherjee]]) &amp; [[Deb Mukherjee|Deb]] Mukherjee (father of director [[Ayan Mukerji]]), directors &amp; producers [[Shomu Mukherjee]] (husband of actress [[Tanuja]] and father of actresses [[Kajol]] and [[Tanishaa Mukerji]]) &amp; Shubhir Mukherjee, and Shibani Mukherjee. [[Kajol]], in turn, is married to actor [[Ajay Devgan]], the son of fight choreographer [[Veeru Devgan]].

==Extended family==

Actresses [[Rani Mukherjee]] (granddaughter of [[Ravindramohan Mukherjee]] &amp; daughter of director [[Ram Mukherjee]] and singer Krishna Mukherjee), and actor [[Mohnish Behl]] come from the extended Mukherjee-Samarth family. The film involvement of the clan began with actress [[Rattan Bai]], mother of actress [[Shobhna Samarth]], aunt to actress [[Nalini Jaywant]] and grandmother of actresses [[Tanuja]] and [[Nutan]]. Reportedly, music director [[Bappi Lahiri]] is also in the Mukherjee's extended family tree. Actress [[Chhaya Devi]] was first cousin of actor [[Ashok Kumar]]'s wife [[Shobha Ganguly]], thus related to the Ganguly family.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Film world, Volume 16 |author=  |publisher=T.M.

'''Horror films in Cambodia''', first popular in the 1970s, have received renewed attention in [[Cinema of Cambodia|Cambodian film making]] since the resurgence of the local industry in 2003. [[Horror Film|Horror]] is one of three popular genres into which most Cambodian films can be loosely grouped, the other two being [[Historical period drama|period pieces]] and [[melodrama]]/[[Romance film|romantic drama]]. The fledgling Cambodian industry of the mid 2000s looked to capitalize on the world-wide popularity of [[Japanese horror]] films which have heavily influenced Cambodian horror films. Common themes are ghost or spirit hauntings, possession, folk mythology and revenge by supernatural means. The storytelling takes a slower pace than Western horror and relies on [[suspense]], a pervasive sense of doom and dread, and [[Psychological horror|psychologically disturbing]] events and situations. Unlike its Japanese counterparts however, many Cambodian horror films also feature over the top gore as seen in Western horror.

==History==

One of the earliest successful Cambodian Horror movies was the 1970s film [[The Snake King's Wife]] by [[Tia Kim Kon]]. Other films followed such as ''[[Crocodile Man]]'', ''[[The Snake King's Wife Part 2]]'', ''The Snake girl'' and ''[[My Mother is Arb]]''. These films found success both in Cambodia and abroad. Although the [[Cambodian Civil War]] was being waged in the provinces during this era, there were up to 33 cinemas operating in the capital city of Phnom Penh. Always full of viewers, the theaters provided an escape from the realities of war and taxes imposed on the brisk ticket sales provided the weakening government with a source of revenue with which to fight the encroaching [[Khmer Rouge]].&lt;ref name=Peou&gt;{{cite book|last1=Chivoin|first1=Peou|title=Contemporary Cambodian Cinema: Gender and Generations|date=2007|publisher=ProQuest|location=Southern Illinois University at Carbondale|isbn=0549604065|url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=fSHtKpfQMtYC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PR1&amp;dq=cambodian+horror+movies&amp;ots=JFdLywd1es&amp;sig=1luKa5HBn6RtpBJLR2R6pYKfnUI#v=onepage&amp;q=cambodian%20horror%20movies&amp;f=false|accessdate=26 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the war began to threaten Phnom Penh in 1974, cinemas began to close and movie production all but halted. When the Khmer Rouge gained control of the government in 1975, the [[Khmer Rouge rule of Cambodia|new regime]] abolished institutional establishments such as currency, education, markets and private property. [[cinema of Cambodia|Movie production]] in Cambodia ceased to exist as artists, producers, actors and singers were executed to "get rid of any Western legacy of the capitalist ideology".&lt;ref name=Peou /&gt;

After the [[Vietnamese invasion of Cambodia]] ended Khmer Rouge rule in 1979, cinemas began to open again, but only showed foreign films (specifically from Vietnam, the [[USSR]], and [[Eastern Bloc|Soviet Bloc]] countries) due to lack of both human and material resources to make movies locally. Despite these films being mostly propaganda vehicles with some from the romance genre, moviegoers starving for entertainment flocked to the hot, overcrowded theaters, standing in line for hours for a chance to buy tickets or bribe security guards to get in.&lt;ref name=Peou /&gt; This public enthusiasm led to the revival of the native Cambodian film industry in 1987. Horror films were still not allowed, however, as financial backing came primarily from Vietnam and the USSR and movies could not offend the Vietnamese-backed government.

The new themes introduced by the Cambodian-produced films, including romance stories and tales of hardship under Khmer Rouge rule, were widely popular which resulted in 215 production companies and almost 40 theaters in Phnom Penh, [[Siem Reap Province|Siem Reap]] and [[Battambang Province|Battambang]]. Yet, once again, this revival was short-lived, as the 1991 [[1991 Paris Peace Accords|withdrawal of the Vietnamese from Cambodia]] and the subsequent [[United Nations Transitional Authority in Cambodia]] opened the markets to massively copied high budget foreign films from Hong Kong and serialized [[soap opera|television soaps]] from Thailand. Most Cambodian film companies were forced out of business but the competition from television and foreign markets also raised the standards of the few remaining companies and a couple movies were produced that presaged the rising popularity of the Horror genre.&lt;ref name=Peou /&gt;

The [[2003 Phnom Penh riots]], aimed at Thai institutions and ostensibly caused by anti-Cambodian comments allegedly made by a Thai actress, resulted in the banning of Thai soap operas and films which by that time had represented the majority of screen time in Cambodia. This allowed Cambodian producers to once again fill the vacuum&lt;ref name=Peou /&gt; and just happened to coincide with the worldwide popularity of [[J-Horror]] (Japanese Horror films), spurred on in part by the success of the [[The Ring (2002 film)|US remake]] of [[Ring (film)|''Ring'']].

==Modern films==

Modern Khmer producers have catered to the young public's taste for movies within the horror genre but domestic production companies typically have low budgets and employ weak special effects. Nonetheless, these horror movies, after decades of absence, have been very successful with local audiences, especially among the younger demographic groups. Korm Chanthy, the manager of FCI Productions, which made the popular 2004 ''[[Nieng Arp]]'', said "We make movies to suit the domestic market and the demand of our youths and they like to watch horror movies because they make them feel excited, thrilled and terrified".&lt;ref name=Taipei&gt;{{cite news|title=Cambodian films are undergoing a rebirth|url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/feat/archives/2006/01/06/2003287766|accessdate=29 September 2015|work=Taipei Times|date=6 January 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 2004 and 2006, the domestic producers made nearly 20 horror films per year. Since 2004, almost 50% of Khmer films were of the horror genre. The most prolific producers of these horror films were FCI Production and [[Campro Production]], a company founded in 2003 by young producer and computer entrepreneur [[Heng Tola]] and several friends. Although Campro Production closed in 2007, these two companies provided the Cambodian market over 15 horror films as of 2011. Budgets were typically very small and special effects were often lackluster compared to foreign horror movies. Making an entire movie took Campro about three months and cost an average of US$30,000, including $1,000 for the lead actor.&lt;ref name=Taipei /&gt;

The 2001 Thai-Khmer joint film ''[[The Snake King's Child]]'', a retelling of 1971's ''[[The Snake King's Wife]]'', was recognized as the first Cambodian horror film to be released since before the Khmer Rouge era. The movie was a comparatively tame film, adapted from an old folk tale and not displaying the characteristic elements of the later, post-2003, horror films. The popularity of ''The Snake King's Child'' inspired a sequel, ''[[The Snake King's Grandchild]]'', which involved a ghost story based on the mythology of the ''ap'' ([[Thai language|Thai]]: ''[[krasue]]'') legend.

In early 2003, the film ''Kohak Kmorch Tek Snech Asara Peak'', a period ghost film was released. A psychological thriller, ''[[The Weird Villa]]'', produced by Angkor Wat Production and written by ''Pan Phuong Bopha'', achieved some box office success and was considered one of the outstanding films of the year.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}} It was followed by several major grossing horror films including ''Nieng Arp'' (English title: ''Lady Vampire''), also centered on the popular ''ap'' legend, and ''[[Ghost Banana Tree]]'', produced by Campro Production.

Films developed after 2003 featured several remakes, mostly of foreign films, including ''Neang Neath'', ''Neang Pomiry'', and the 2006 hit ''[[The Killing Phone]]'' which is a remake of the Thai movie ''[[999-9999]]'' and includes [[Homage (arts)|homages]] to [[Ring (film)|''Ringu'']] and [[One Missed Call (2003 film)|''One Missed Call'']].&lt;ref name = "'Khmer Movies"&gt;[http://samnangeng.wordpress.com/2008/11/23/%e1%9e%97%e1%9e%b6%e1%9e%96%e1%9e%99%e1%9f%92%e1%9e%8f%e1%9e%93%e1%9e%81%e1%9f%82%e1%9f%92%e1%9e%98%e1%9e%9a%e1%9e%8a%e1%9f%82%e1%9e%9b%e1%9e%85%e1%9f%86%e1%9e%9b%e1%9e%84%e1%9e%96%e1%9e%b8%e1%9e%94/ ភាពយ្តនខែ្មរដែលចំលងពីបរទេស], A Movies and The culture around The World.&lt;/ref&gt;

Top grossing and award winning horror films from this era include [[The Crocodile (film)|''The Crocodile'']], a tale about the heroism of a man who killed the beast responsible for the deaths of several people in his village. Released in 2005, ''The Crocodile'' cost over $100,000 to make, the highest budgeted Cambodian production to date, won several awards and was re-released in 2007 due to its popularity. Other notable 2005 releases were [[The Forest (2005 film)|''The Forest'']], a graphic film which won an award for best special effects, and [[The Haunted House (2005 film)|''The Haunted House'']], both produced by Campro Production.

==Governmental criticism==
In the Third Khmer film festival which was held in late 2007, horror films were banned from competition on the grounds that too many horror movies had been made.&lt;ref name="មហោស្រពភាពយន្តជាតិ"&gt;
[http://naraths.wordpress.com/2008/01/06/%e1%9e%98%e1%9e%a0%e1%9f%84%e1%9e%9f%e1%9f%92%e1%9e%9a%e1%9e%96%e2%80%8b%e1%9e%97%e1%9e%b6%e1%9e%96%e1%9e%99%e1%9e%93%e1%9f%92%e1%9e%8f%e2%80%8b%e1%9e%87%e1%9e%b6%e1%9e%8f%e1%9e%b7/#comments] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090213163414/http://naraths.wordpress.com/2008/01/06/%E1%9E%98%E1%9E%A0%E1%9F%84%E1%9E%9F%E1%9F%92%E1%9E%9A%E1%9E%96%E2%80%8B%E1%9E%97%E1%9E%B6%E1%9E%96%E1%9E%99%E1%9E%93%E1%9F%92%E1%9E%8F%E2%80%8B%E1%9E%87%E1%9E%B6%E1%9E%8F%E1%9E%B7/ |date=2009-02-13 }}, Naraths.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Khmer Culture and Film ministry suggested that Khmer film makers should decrease their production of works in the horror genre despite their immense popularity with local audiences, especially the younger generation. In addition, a recent downturn in the domestic film market has left some producers believing the horror genre is serving to keep Cambodian cinema alive.

According to Heng Tola, the current popularity of horror movies is waning in favor of "a more serious" emerging trend, both fueled by and feeding into the bitterness many Cambodians still hold on to regarding their country's recent history, specifically the humiliation of colonialism and losing territory, respect and political, economic and military prestige to powerful neighbors, Thailand and Vietnam.&lt;ref name=Taipei /&gt;

Cambodian horror films, like those of Thailand, are heavily influenced by popular [[Japanese horror|Japanese]] and [[Korean horror]] films but also display elements from Western (American) horror as well. The plot of Cambodian horror films generally center on a ghost story, physically or psychologically violent revenge, spirit hauntings or possessions, or myths taken from Cambodian folk religion such as the [[Krasue|''ap'']].&lt;ref name = "វិញ្ញាណអាបរឺក្រាស៊ូ៖អបិយជំនឿងដ៏ល្បីនៅនៅអាស៊ី"&gt;

One film, [[The Haunted House (2005 film)|''The Haunted House'']], is loosely based on an actual [[urban legend]] surrounding a supposedly haunted house in [[Kampong Chhnang Province]].&lt;ref name=Carden&gt;{{cite news|last1=Carden|first1=Phil|title=Villagers pray to spirits of 'ghost house'|url=http://www.phnompenhpost.com/lifestyle/villagers-pray-spirits-ghost-house|accessdate=29 September 2015|work=Phnom Penh Post|date=26 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similar to more widely known Japanese movies, the more popular films rely on storytelling that takes a slower pace than Western horror, building suspense and focusing on the characters' suffering and anguish. A pervasive sense of doom and dread is maintained by portraying [[Psychological horror|psychologically disturbing]] situations and events. In a departure from the East Asian formula, however, Cambodian films often feature over-the-top gore and cheaply overdone effects. Popular horror films in this modern vein that emphasize psychological terror include ''[[The Weird Villa]]'', ''[[Secret Well]]'' (from Ángkor Wat Productions), and ''[[Heart Talk]]'', a 2008 [[Khmer Mekong Films]] production written by British novelist and screenwriter [[Matt Baylis]].&lt;ref name="ទំនួញបេះដូង នឹងបញ្ចាំងឆាប់ៗ "&gt;{{cite web|url=http://naraths.wordpress.com/2008/09/14/heart-talk/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-12-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110630023858/http://naraths.wordpress.com/2008/09/14/heart-talk/ |archivedate=2011-06-30 |df= }}, Naraths.&lt;/ref&gt;

Films with revenge motifs are usually based on unrequited or betrayed love and often feature the offended person, who either is killed or commits suicide, rising from the dead either as a ghostly apparition or a spirit that can possess other bodies. The plots are usually resolved only after sufficient revenge has been taken or when the ghost or spirit is defeated by a holy man (an [[Acharya|Achaa]], [[Ruesi]], or ''Khru'') or a Buddhist Monk. Popular revenge-themed movies include ''[[Villa Horror]]'', ''[[Annoyed (film)|Annoyed]]'' and ''Moheagita''.

Cambodian "monster" films are another subgenre of horror. Although considered a relatively new subgenre, these movies are just extensions of the older folk mythology type films with different monsters.  Similar to the older ''Snake King'' films, these low-budget monster films employ lots of outdoor cinematography and amateurish special effects. The characters in monster movies are usually groups of teens on outings or cross country journeys without adult supervision. Well known examples of monster films are [[The Forest (2005 film)|''The Forest'']], ''Queen of Cobra'' and ''People eating Lizard''.

[[Slasher film]]s haven't been very common but a few have been made in Cambodia. Most portray many adolescent victims killed in a typically random, unprovoked fashion usually within a single night. The first slasher film produced by a Cambodian company was ''The Waterfall of Death'', which has noted similarities to the American murder thriller ''[[I Know What You Did Last Summer]]'' and the Thai psychological killer film ''[[Scared (2005 film)|Scared]]''.

'''''Hurl!''''' is an [[United States|American]] television [[game show]] from [[G4 (U.S. TV channel)|G4]] that first premiered on G4 in the USA on July 16, 2008. It takes a unique twist on [[competitive eating]].  The concept is for competitors to alternate between challenges of competitive eating and extreme activities in order to see who will be last to [[vomiting|vomit]].  The winner receives $1,000 cash on the spot.

==Format==
The show begins with an unidentified person shopping for food and purchasing the food for the current episode, with a narration about competition.  The intro ends with the clerk asking "What are you going to do with all this stuff?"

Prior to the game beginning, some information is provided via the narrators and on-screen text. All on-screen information for the viewer is done by holding up a [[post-it note]] or a notebook with handwriting on them. The "one simple rule" of the game is incorrectly described by the narrator as "whoever eats the most and hurls the least, wins". In fact the winner is the contestant that eats the most and hurls the ''last'' or not at all. Five competitors are introduced by name, height, weight, and occupation. The five begin the game by eating large quantities of food, usually a single savory dish accompanied with a drink to help wash it down.  All food and drinks are identified as being [[organic food|organic]]. The food is placed on deli [[weighing scale|scales]], which are used to determine through subtraction how much each competitor eats.  Of the five competitors, only the three that eat the most in a span of five minutes make it through to the second round.

The second round involves some sort of physical or recreational activity, usually one that involves large amounts of spinning, for five minutes.  The activity can end early if one of the contestants vomits.  A "hurl" is defined on the show as any ''swallowed'' food that comes out of the mouth.  If a player vomits into their mouth and it does not come out, it is not a "hurl".

For the third round, competitors return to the scales and eat for another four minutes.  Sometimes they eat the same food as the first round, while other times they move to a second food item, usually a [[dessert]].  If three competitors make it to the third round, then the two that eat the most in the third round move on, unless somebody vomits first.

After the third round, if two competitors are left, a fourth round of extreme activities is done in a "sudden barf" format: first to "hurl", loses.  Sometimes the extreme activity is done blindfolded to induce [[Equilibrioception|disequilibrium]] and [[nausea]].  If necessary, a fifth round of eating and a sixth round of blindfolded extreme activities are done as well.  If both players make it through all six rounds without hurling, then the one that ate the most during just the fifth round wins the contest.

The game crew that runs the competition is called the "hazmat team".  They are several people dressed in Level C [[hazmat suit]]s, complete with gas masks, and act as a cleanup crew.  Although they are dealing with bodily fluids, necessitating some precaution, their dress is exaggerated for comedic effect.

When a player vomits on-screen, the vomit is censored with numbered buckets and a pinball game sound effect.  The buckets are used to arbitrarily rate the scale of the vomiting, up to an {{YouTube|FKrdrssfNCQ|"epic five-bucket blowout"}}, although in Episode 11, a contestant hurls while being spun by a [[Sumo]] wrestler, and the narrator observes that on a scale of 1 to 5 buckets, this was an 11 bucket hurl.  They are usually (but not always) preceded by a "hurl warning" with a handwritten note in front of the camera and a [[Klaxon]], which also is sometimes used with close calls and fakeouts.  The show also shows various "strategies" employed by some players to either eat more food or try to induce other players to vomit.  Each strategy or technique has a number that is shown to the viewer on a handwritten note.

The last one remaining wins $1,000, which is paid immediately in cash by "Manny" ([[Manny Salcido]]), the leader of the hazmat team.  If the winner also ate the most food in the contest, then they also win the "Iron Stomach Award".  Sometimes the winner will vomit after their win; since they already won, this does not affect the outcome of the game. The show will also depict competitors that have lost and vomit after being eliminated.

The G4 network aired all 11 episodes in an uncensored (no buckets and no sound effects) format after the censored episodes had been shown.

:[[File:Tuồng SH.jpg|thumb|The make-up of an actor can reveal the character's personalities.]]''For the Vietnamese fermented soybean paste, see [[Tương]]''.
'''''Hát tuồng''''' ({{IPA-vi|háːt tûəŋ|h}}) or '''''hát bội''''' ({{IPA-vi|háːk ɓôjˀ|s}})&lt;ref&gt;Transnationalism and Society: An Introduction - Page 267 Michael C. Howard - 2011 "Vietnamese Opera The Vietnamese have a variant of Chinese opera known as hat tuong in northern dialect and hat boi in southern dialect.&lt;/ref&gt; is a form of [[Vietnamese theatre]]. Hát tuồng is often referred to as classical "[[Vietnamese opera]]" influenced by [[Chinese opera]].&lt;ref&gt;Bobbie Kalman '' Vietnam: The Culture'' 2002 Page 8  "Hat tuong is classical Vietnamese opera."&lt;/ref&gt;  &lt;ref name="Tuong or Hat Boi"&gt;{{cite web|publisher= vietnam-culture|title=Tuong or Hat Boi|url= http://www.vietnam-culture.com/articles-37-8/Tuong-%28Hat-Boi%29.aspx}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tuồng is distinct from the older [[hát chèo]] genre of [[Vietnamese theatre]] which combines dance, song and poetry, and the more modern [[cải lương]] folk musical.

==History==
The origin of ''tuồng'' is still unclear. It is believed that it was imported from China around the 13th century when Vietnam was warring against the Mongol [[Yuan Dynasty]].  A famous actor named Lý Nguyên Cát (李元吉) was imprisoned by the Vietnamese. The imperial court asked him to spread his knowledge of Chinese theatre to the children of the elite, thus explaining how tuồng had first had its beginnings in Vietnam in the royal court.&lt;ref&gt;[http://vietmusic.pbwiki.com/f/vnnews_theaterandart-HatBoi.htm Theater &amp; Art - Hat boi- 100&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Later on, it was adapted to travelling troupes who entertained commoners and peasants.

However, the first one to lay the foundation for the art of tuồng in Vietnam is [[Dao Duy Tu]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://daoduytu.com.vn/dao-duy-tu-voi-cong-cuoc-phat-trien-hat-tuong-hat-boi|title=Đào Duy Từ với công cuộc phát triển hát tuồng, hát bội|website=daoduytu.com.vn|language=en|access-date=2017-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Under the [[Nguyen dynasty]] which he served for, tuồng reached its highest point and was favored by Nguyen kings. Many great playwrights including Đào Tấn were also in this time. 

Along with ''[[Hát chèo]]'', ''tuồng'' was one of the highly popular art forms for commoners until 20th century. With the arrival of [[Cai Luong]] and modern theatrics, tuong gradually lost its position. 

==Storylines==
Stories in the opera tend to be ostensibly historical and frequently focus on the rules of social decorum, and can include legends from either the [[history of China]] or [[History of Vietnam|Vietnam]]. 

== Make-up ==
''Tuồng'' employs the use of [[stock character]]s who are recognizable from their make-up and costumes, which are typically very elaborate and extravagant. 

Usually, a character's personalities can be revealed through three features: the color of the face, the eyebrows, and the beard&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://adammuzic.vn/nhung-dieu-co-ban-ve-hat-boi/|title=Những điều cơ bản về nghệ thuật hát bội|date=2017-09-12|access-date=2017-11-18|language=vi-VN}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

In Japan, a {{nihongo|'''junior idol'''|ジュニアアイドル|junia aidoru}}, alternatively {{nihongo|'''''chidol'''''|チャイドル|chaidoru}} or {{nihongo|'''low teen idol'''|ローティーンアイドル|rōtīn aidoru}}, is primarily defined as young child pursuing a career as a photographic [[Model (person)|model]]. Generally, this means [[gravure idol|gravure]], or "cheesecake", fully clothed shots; but, junior idols can, and some do, eventually enter the [[AV idol|AV]] industry.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}} Child [[actor]]s, [[musician]]s, and [[J-pop]] [[singer]]s (whose musical genre is often termed idol pop) can also be considered junior idols and are often featured in [[shashinshū|photobooks]] and image [[DVD]]s.

Female [[fashion model]]s (not to be confused with [[glamour model]]s, including [[gravure idol]]s) also begin their careers typically at age 13–15, but are usually not considered junior idols. [[Child modeling|Child models]], whose careers are usually over by their early young years, are also not usually considered junior idols

==Definition==
There exists no clear set of guidelines regarding the age at which an individual becomes a junior idol: [[Yumi Adachi]], for instance, started her modeling career at age two and many other idols have starred in image DVDs at the ages of three, four and five. The majority of junior idols belong to specialized talent agencies, some of which offer acting and voice training and are geared towards the production of television commercials, photobooks, and related materials. Though sources indicate revenue is relatively low for photographic models, a number of idols (and their parents) see this activity as a gateway to more mainstream media roles.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.livedoor.com/article/detail/3353250/ {{ja icon}} Livedoor News article covering the arrest of 4 Shinkosha executive staff members] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071023051204/http://news.livedoor.com/article/detail/3353250/ |date=2007-10-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These transitions are indeed frequent, one example being the case of [[Saaya Irie]] who was cast into the live action adaptation of the popular [[Anime|anime series]] ''[[Hell Girl]]'' and several other television programs. Conversely, some aspiring idols eventually find themselves pursuing less and less mainstream work.

== History ==
The trend of junior idols dates back to the mid-1990s, a period marked by significant increase in the number of child models and works involving individuals in that age range.&lt;ref name="japantoday"&gt;{{cite web |first=Patrick  |last= W Galbraith |url= http://www.japantoday.com/category/lifestyle/view/innocence-lost-the-dark-side-of-akihabara | title= Innocence lost: the dark side of Akihabara |date=2009-07-08 |accessdate= 2015-10-08|work=''[[Metropolis (free magazine)|Metropolis]]'' |publisher=JapanToday}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term ''chidol'', a [[neologism]] of the words "child" and "idol", was coined by columnist [[Akio Nakamori]] to describe this new phenomena.&lt;ref name="japantoday" /&gt; Eventually, this term fell out of use and was replaced by "Junior Idol".&lt;ref name="japantoday" /&gt; Compared to ''chidol'', the term "junior idol" plays down the association with age and lends some credibility to the industry associating it with the legitimate mainstream [[Japanese idol|idol culture in Japan]].&lt;ref name="japantoday" /&gt;

==Distribution==
Content is available in many formats, usually physical goods such as bond photobooks, [[Compact Disc|CD]]s and DVDs, but also digital content in the form of [[Portable Document Format]] books, [[JPEG]] photo sets, high resolution movie clips, etc. To promote a particular idol, or to celebrate the release of a specific title, certain stores hold special events where fans get to meet the idols, shake hands with them, obtain autographs or take photographs, either polaroids or pictures taken with the customers' own cameras, in accordance with the amount of money spent on related goods (either regular DVDs, photobooks, etc., or multiple copies of the same title).

Concerning the contents of the titles put on sale, these include, in general terms, pictures or footage of the idols trying out a variety of outfits, such as [[sailorfuku|school uniforms]], bathing suits, gym clothes, [[yukata]] or even maid, police and anime-inspired [[cosplay|costumes]].

Some services providers, such as {{nihongo|''Imouto Club''|清純いもうと倶楽部|Seijun Imōto Kurabu}}—a subscription-based website—also feature short radio and movie dramas, available for download and later purchase on DVD.

==Controversy==
The junior idol industry is a highly contentious one in Japan. Many Japanese criticise such depictions of underaged girls, including some Japanese politicians.&lt;ref name="japantoday" /&gt; Despite such disapproval, stores selling junior idol-related materials proliferate in prominent areas such as [[Oimoya]], an area located in Japan's well-known [[Akihabara]] shopping district.&lt;ref name="japantoday" /&gt;

Internationally, the junior idol trend has been harshly criticised. In 2008, the [[UNICEF|United Nations Children's Fund]] launched a Say 'NO' to Child Pornography campaign in Japan.&lt;ref name="unicef"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.unicef.org/infobycountry/japan_46426.html | title= Saying ‘No’ to child pornography in Japan |date=2008-11-18 |accessdate= 2015-10-08|work=[[UNICEF]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; As part of the campaign, four major internet portal site providers in Japan removed junior idol-related content from their services.&lt;ref name="unicef" /&gt; The campaign also garnered over 100,000 signatures in a petition to the Japanese government to amend its child pornography laws to criminalise procession of child pornography, including junior idol materials.&lt;ref name="unicef" /&gt;

===Legal status===
Junior idol materials stand on legally ambiguous ground in Japan.&lt;ref name="jptimes"&gt;Jun Hongo, [http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/nn20070503f1.html "Photos of preteen girls in thongs now big business"], ''[[The Japan Times]]'', May 3, 2007. Accessed 2 July 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Regulation of such materials comes under the [[Child pornography laws in Japan|Japanese Anti-child prostitution and pornography law]].&lt;ref name="jptimes" /&gt;

The Japanese Anti-child prostitution and pornography law was enacted in November 1999&amp;mdash;and revised in 2004 to criminalize distribution of child pornography over the Internet&amp;mdash;defines child pornography as the depiction "in a way that can be recognized visually, such a pose of a child relating to sexual intercourse or an act similar to sexual intercourse with or by the child", of "a pose of a child relating to the act of touching genital organs, etc." or the depiction of "a pose of a child who is naked totally or partially in order to arouse or stimulate the viewer's sexual desire."&lt;ref&gt;The punishment for this offence and the production of child pornography ranges from fines up to 5 million yen and/or up to 5 years imprisonment, with [[hard labor]]. t [http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20010925003412/http://www.interpol.int/public/children/sexualabuse/nationallaws/csajapan.asp Sexual Offense Laws in Japan], [[Interpol]].&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''Kobzar''' ({{lang-ua|кобзар}}, [[plural|pl.]] kobzari {{lang-ua|кобзарі}}) was an itinerant Ukrainian bard who sang to his own accompaniment played on a multistringed [[bandura]] or [[kobza]].

==Tradition==

Kobzars were often blind and became predominantly so by the 1800s.  ''Kobzar'' literally means '[[kobza]] player', a Ukrainian stringed instrument of the [[lute]] family, and more broadly — a performer of the musical material associated with the kobzar tradition.&lt;ref&gt;Volodymyr Kushpet "Startsivstvo",  500pp, Kyiv "Tempora" 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rainer Maria Rilke, Susan Ranson, Ben Hutchinson(2008), [https://books.google.com/books?id=z3SBPqzapVEC&amp;pg=PA215&amp;dq=Kobzar+blind&amp;hl=cs&amp;ei=pFCjTIO7OsjIswbBo-nHCg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=10&amp;ved=0CFMQ6AEwCQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Kobzar%20blind&amp;f=false ''Rainer Maria Rilke's The book of hours''], Camden House. p. 215. {{ISBN|1-57113-380-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The professional kobzar tradition was established during the [[Cossack Hetmanate|Hetmanate Era]] around the sixteenth century in [[History of Ukraine|Ukraine]]. Kobzars accompanied their singing with a musical instrument known as the [[kobza]], [[bandura]], or [[lira (instrument)|lira]]. Their repertoire primarily consisted of para-liturgical psalms and "kanty", and also included a unique epic form known as [[Duma (epic)|dumas]]. 

At the turn of the nineteenth century there were three regional kobzar schools: [[Chernihiv kobzars|Chernihiv]], [[Poltava kobzars|Poltava]], and [[Slobozhan kobzars|Slobozhan]], which were differentiated by repertoire and playing style.

==Guilds==

In Ukraine, kobzars organized themselves into regional guilds or brotherhoods, known as [[Kobzars'kyj Tsekh|tsekhs]]. They developed a system of rigorous apprenticeships (usually three years in length) before undergoing the first set of open examinations in order to become a kobzar. 

These guilds were thought to have been modelled on the Orthodox Church brotherhoods as each guild was associated with a specific church. These guilds then would take care of one church icon or purchase new religious ornaments for their affiliated church (Kononenko, p.&amp;nbsp;568–9). The Orthodox Church however was often suspicious of and occasionally even hostile to kobzars.

==End of kobzardom==
{{See|Persecuted bandurists}}

The institution of the kobzardom essentially ended in the [[Ukrainian SSR]] in the mid 1930s during Stalin's radical transformation of rural society which included the [[Persecuted bandurists|liquidation of the kobzars]] of Ukraine.&lt;ref&gt;[http://grigorenko.org/_wsn/page3.html Grigorenko site] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050207222215/http://grigorenko.org/_wsn/page3.html |date=2005-02-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Kobzar performance was replaced with stylized performances of folk and classical music utilising the [[bandura]].

== Soviet version ==
{{See|Soviet kobzars}}

[[Soviet kobzars]] were stylised performers on the bandura created to replace the traditional authentic kobzari who had been wiped out in the 1930s. These performers were often blind and although some actually had contact with the authentic kobzari of the previous generation, many received formal training in the Folk conservatories by trained musicians and played on contemporary chromatic concert factory made instruments. 

Their repertoire was primarily made up of censored versions of traditional kobzar repertoire and focused on stylized works that praised the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] system and Soviet heroes. 

==Re-establishment of the tradition==

[[File:Modern Day Bard Outside of Santa Sofia in Kiev.webm|thumb|275px|A modern-day kobzar is playing a haunting tune on the [[bandura]].]]
In recent times, there has been an interest in reviving of authentic kobzar traditions which is marked by the re-establishing the [[Kobzarskyi Tsekh|Kobzar Guild]] as a centre for the dissemination of historical authentic performance practice.

== Other use of the term ==

''[[Kobzar (book)|Kobzar]]'' is also a seminal book of poetry by [[Taras Shevchenko]], the great national poet of [[Ukraine]].

The term "kobzar" has on occasion been used for [[hurdy-gurdy]] players in [[Belarus]] (where the hurdy-gurdy is often referred to as a "kobza", and [[bagpipe]] players in [[Poland]] where the bagpipe is referred to as a "kobza" or "koza".

[[Image:Lindos1.svg|thumb|400px|right|&lt;center&gt;The horizontal axis shows '''[[frequency]]''' in '''[[Hertz|Hz]]'''&lt;/center&gt;]]

In [[acoustics]], '''loudness''' is the [[Subjectivity|subjective]] perception of [[sound pressure]]. More formally, it is defined as, "That attribute of auditory sensation in terms of which sounds can be ordered on a scale extending from quiet to loud."&lt;ref&gt;American National Standards Institute, "American national psychoacoustical terminology" S3.20, 1973, American Standards Association.&lt;/ref&gt; The relation of physical attributes of sound to perceived loudness consists of physical, physiological and psychological components. The study of apparent loudness is included in the topic of [[psychoacoustics]] and employs methods of [[psychophysics]].

In different industries, loudness may have different meanings and different measurement standards. Some definitions, such as [[LKFS|ITU-R BS.1770]] refer to relative loudness of different segments of electronically reproduced sounds, such as for broadcasting and cinema. Others, such as ISO 532A (Stevens loudness, measured in [[sone]]s), ISO 532B ([[Eberhard_Zwicker|Zwicker]] loudness), DIN 45631 and ASA/ANSI S3.4, have a more general scope and are often used to characterize loudness of environmental noise.

Loudness, a subjective measure, often confused with physical measures of sound strength such as sound pressure, [[sound pressure level]] (in [[decibel]]s), [[sound intensity]] or [[sound power]]. Filters such as [[A-weighting]] and [[LKFS]] attempt to compensate measurements to correspond to loudness as perceived by the typical human.

== Explanation ==
The perception of loudness is related to [[sound pressure level]] (SPL), frequency content and duration of a sound.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Poulsen|first1=Torben|title=Loudness of tone pulses in a free field|journal=The Journal of the Acoustical Society of America|date=1981|volume=69|page=1786|url=https://asa.scitation.org/doi/abs/10.1121/1.385915|bibcode=1981ASAJ...69.1786P|doi=10.1121/1.385915}}&lt;/ref&gt; The relationship between SPL and loudness of a single tone can be approximated by [[Stevens's power law]] in which SPL has an exponent of 0.67.{{efn|The relationship between loudness and energy ''intensity'' of sound can therefore be approximated by a power function with an exponent of 0.3.}} More precise measurements indicate that loudness increases with a higher exponent at low and high levels and with a lower exponent at moderate levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Florentine|first1=Mary|title=To honor Stevens and repeal his law|journal=Proceedings of the International Society for Psychophysics|date=2006|volume=22|url=https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=DYB56FMAAAAJ&amp;hl=en&amp;oi=ao#d=gs_md_cita-d&amp;p=&amp;u=%2Fcitations%3Fview_op%3Dview_citation%26hl%3Den%26user%3DDYB56FMAAAAJ%26citation_for_view%3DDYB56FMAAAAJ%3Ad1gkVwhDpl0C%26tzom%3D420}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The sensitivity of the human ear changes as a function of frequency, as shown in the [[Equal-loudness contour|equal-loudness graph]]. Each line on this graph shows the SPL required for frequencies to be perceived as equally loud, and different curves pertain to different sound pressure levels. It also shows that humans with normal hearing are most sensitive to sounds around 2–4&amp;nbsp;kHz, with sensitivity declining to either side of this region. A complete model of the perception of loudness will include the integration of SPL by frequency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Olson|first1=Harry|title=The Measurement of Loudness|journal=Audio Magazine|date=1972|url=https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=8587541427905974401&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=0,5&amp;sciodt=0,5#d=gs_qabs&amp;p=&amp;u=%23p%3DgVBJEG4TLXcJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Historically, loudness was measured using an "ear-balance" [[audiometer]] in which the [[amplitude]] of a sine wave was adjusted by the user to equal the perceived loudness of the sound being evaluated. Contemporary standards for measurement of loudness are based on summation of energy in [[critical band]]s.&lt;ref&gt;As described in [[International Electrotechnical Commission|IEC]] 532, [[Deutsches Institut für Normung|DIN]] 45631 and ASA/[[American National Standards Institute|ANSI]] S3.4&lt;/ref&gt;

== Hearing loss ==
When [[sensorineural hearing loss]] (damage to the [[cochlea]] or in the brain) is present, the perception of loudness is altered. Sounds at low levels (often perceived by those without hearing loss as relatively quiet) are no longer audible to the hearing impaired, but sounds at high levels often are perceived as having the same loudness as they would for an unimpaired listener. This phenomenon can be explained by two theories, called ''loudness recruitment'' and ''softness imperception''.

Loudness recruitment posits that loudness grows more rapidly for certain listeners than normal listeners with changes in level. This theory has been accepted as the classical explanation.

Softness imperception, a term coined by [[Mary Florentine]] around 2002,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |author=[[Mary Florentine]] |title=It's not recruitment-gasp!! It's softness imperception |url=http://journals.lww.com/thehearingjournal/Fulltext/2003/03000/It_s_not_recruitment_gasp___It_s_softness.3.aspx |publisher=Hearing Journal |date=March 2003 |volume=56 |issue=3 |doi=10.1097/01.HJ.0000293012.17887.b4 |pages=10, 12, 14, 15}}&lt;/ref&gt; proposes that some listeners with sensorineural hearing loss may exhibit a normal rate of loudness growth, but instead have an elevated loudness at their threshold. That is, the softest sound that is audible to these listeners is louder than the softest sound audible to normal listeners.

==Compensation==
{{Main|Loudness compensation}}
The "loudness" control on some consumer stereos alters the [[frequency response]] curve to correspond roughly with the equal loudness characteristic of the ear.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=John D. |last=Lenk |title=Circuit Troubleshooting Handbook |publisher=[[McGraw-Hill]] |year=1998 |isbn=0-07-038185-2 |page=163}}&lt;/ref&gt; Loudness compensation is intended to make the recorded music sound more natural when played at a lower levels by boosting low frequencies, to which the ear is less sensitive at lower sound pressure levels.

==Normalization==
Loudness normalization is a specific type of [[audio normalization]] that equalizes perceived level such that, for instance, commercials do not sound louder than television programs. Loudness normalization schemes exist for a number of audio applications.

===Broadcast===
*[[Commercial Advertisement Loudness Mitigation Act]]
*[[European Broadcasting Union]] R128&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=EBU Recommendation R 128: Loudness normalisation and permitted maximum level of audio signals |url=http://tech.ebu.ch/docs/r/r128.pdf |publisher=[[European Broadcasting Union]] |date=August 2011 |access-date=2013-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Movie and home theaters===
*[[Dialnorm]]

===Music playback===
*Sound Check in [[iTunes]]
*[[ReplayGain]]
*Normalization systems built into streaming services such as [[Spotify]] and [[YouTube]].

==Measurement==
Historically [[Sone]] (loudness ''N'') and [[Phon]] (loudness level ''L'') units have been used to measure loudness.&lt;ref name=Olson1972&gt;{{cite journal |last=Olson |first=Harry F. |date=February 1972 |title=The Measurement of Loudness |journal=Audio |pages=18–22 |url=http://www.technicalaudio.com/pdf/Audio_magazine_issues_articles/Harry%20F.%20Olson%20-%20The%20Measurement%20of%20Loudness.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[A-weighting]] follows human sensitivity to sound and describes relative perceived loudness for at quiet to moderate speech levels, around 40 [[phon]]s.

Relative [[loudness monitoring]] in production is measured in accordance with ITU-R BS.1770 in units of LKFS.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.itu.int/rec/R-REC-BS.1770/ |title=Recommendation BS.1770 |date=August 2012 |publisher=[[International Telecommunication Union]] |access-date=2013-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Work began on ITU-R BS.1770 in 2001 after 0 dBFS+ level distortion in converters and lossy codecs had become evident; and the original Leq(RLB) loudness metric was proposed by Gilbert Soulodre in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.audiofile-engineering.com/support/manuals/sp/1/html/leq_meter.html |title=Leq Meter |access-date=2015-12-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Based on data from subjective listening tests, Leq(RLB) compared favorably to numerous other algorithms. [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|CBC]], [[Dolby Laboratories|Dolby]] and [[TC Electronic]] and numerous broadcasters contributed to the listening tests. 

Loudness levels measured according to the Leq(RLB) specified in ITU-R BS.1770 are reported in [[LKFS]] units. 

The ITU-R BS.1770 measurement system was improved for made multi-channel applications ([[monaural]] to [[5.1 surround sound]]). To make the loudness metric cross-genre friendly, a relative measurement [[Noise gate|gate]] was added. This work was carried out in 2008 by the EBU. The improvements were brought back into BS.1770-2. ITU subsequently updated the true-peak metric (BS.1770-3) and added provision for even more audio channels, for instance [[22.2 surround sound]] (BS.1770-4).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1699">A '''narrative designer''' is a role in contemporary [[video game]] development, the focus of which is to design the narrative elements of a game, and to champion story within the development process, which differentiates it from the role of [[video game writer|game writer]]. The ''Narrative designer'' was first defined by [[Stephen Dinehart]] in the 2006 Job Description he wrote for [[THQ]]. [[Narratology]] as a study has looked at the design of narrative as an artifact, [[narrative design]], in writing since its inception, but the role of the narrative designer in [[interactive storytelling]] differs in that it is an active process to create [[Narrative|story]] via a users navigation of a [[dataspace]].&lt;ref&gt;http://narrativedesign.org/2011/09/what-is-a-narrative-designer-3/&lt;/ref&gt;

The first 'Narrative Designer' job position, was written by [[Stephen Dinehart]] for [[THQ]] Canada dba [[Relic Entertainment]] on the initiative of [[Tarrnie Williams]], Executive Producer, in 2006 to "champion story" based on his work on ''[[Medal of Honor]]''. The role that was eventually offered to and accepted by Dinehart.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/1530/narrative_design_for_company_of_.php Despain, Wendy (2006).

The '''perch''' is an [[Equilibristics|equilibristic]] balancing act where one performer balances atop a pole that is being balanced by another performer. Each perch pole has a loop at the top into which the performer may insert either a hand or a foot in order to perform a variety of tricks while hanging down from the loop. During the whole routine, the base at the bottom must balance the pole as the flier shifts their weight from one position to another, climbs up and down and balances at the top.

==Types of perch pole==

There are several variations on the perch pole.  They include:

* Balancing perch pole
* Swing or Swinging perch pole
* Hanging Perch pole
* Standing perch pole

===Balancing perch pole===
The balancing perch pole consists of a tall steel pole (about 25 feet high and weighing about 50 pounds) with interchangeable top and bottom pieces, which are designed for variations of the act. The standard bottom piece is designed for a person to balance the pole on his shoulders and contains grips for holding the pole with his hands, while a substitute bottom piece may be used for a performer who wishes to balance the pole on his head.

===Swing or swinging perch pole===

The swing pole is an act where one performer holds up a steel pole about twenty feet long as their partner climbs to the top. After the flier fastens themselves to the top of the pole with a neck loop, he spins the pole around as fast as possible until the flier is swinging out almost parallel to the ground.

===Hanging Perch pole===
The hanging perch is a variation on the perch where the pole is hung from an aerial mount point, and a pair of fliers perform tricks and stunts from the pole. Usually this includes the base being supported by an ankle strap on the pole. This allows him or her to stand out on the pole and hold a flyer while he/she performs various acrobatic maneuvers.

===Standing Perch Pole===
The standing perch pole is similar to the hanging perch pole but fastened to the ground by three or four thick cords. Performers can climb and do tricks they could not normally do on any other variant. Standing perch poles come in various sizes. Diagram:

==Perch pole tricks==
Usual tricks include:
*Standouts (the flier braces both feet against the pole and stands out sideways from the pole)
*Leg drops (the flier braces her hands against the pole while hanging from one foot, then lowers her other leg out straight behind her)
*Arabesques
*Headstands
*Leg lifts

'''Periaktos''' (plural form '''Periaktoi''', from [[Greek language|Greek]] ''revolving'') is a device used for displaying and rapidly changing [[theatre]] [[scene (drama)|scene]]s. It was first mentioned in [[Vitruvius]]' book on [[architecture]], ''De architectura'' (c. 14 BC) but its most intense use began in [[History of theatre#Renaissance theatre|Renaissance theatre]], as a result of the work of important theatrical designers, such as [[Nicola Sabbatini]] (1574-1654).

It consists of a revolving solid [[equilateral]] triangular [[Prism (geometry)|prism]] made of [[wood]]. On each of its three faces, a different scene is painted, so that, by quickly revolving the periaktos, another face can appear to the audience. Other solid [[polygon]]s can be used, such as [[cube]]s, but triangular prisms offer the best combination of simplicity, speed and number of scenes per device. A series of periaktoi positioned one after the other along the stage's depth can produce the illusion of a longer scene, composed by its faces as seen in [[perspective (graphical)|perspective]]. These periaktoi must therefore be rotated simultaneously to a new position, thus achieving interesting [[illusion]]s. This is made by coupling them by using [[sprocket]] gears at their bases and a [[flat chain]] or [[conveyor belt]] mechanical transmission system.

A similar concept is used in some modern [[Trivision]] [[Billboard (advertising)|multi-message billboards]], which are made up of a series of triangular prisms arranged so that they can be rotated to present three separate flat display surfaces in succession. 

Early [[motion picture]] mechanical devices, such as the [[praxinoscope]], were also based on rapidly rotating solid polygons, which had the successive animation or photographic plates affixed or projected to each face, thus providing the optical illusion of movement.

==Sex trafficking==
{{see also|Human trafficking in Djibouti}}
Djibouti is a source, transit, and destination country for women and children subjected to [[sex trafficking]], although limited data on trafficking cases has complicated efforts to determine the full scope of the phenomenon. Men, women, and children, primarily from [[Ethiopia]] and [[Somalia]], and to a lesser extent from [[Eritrea]], transit Djibouti voluntarily en route to [[Yemen]] and other locations in the [[Middle East]], particularly Saudi Arabia, to seek work. An unknown number of these migrants are subjected to sex trafficking in their intended destinations.&lt;ref name="state17"&gt;{{cite web|title=Djibouti 2017 Trafficking in Persons Report|url=https://www.state.gov/j/tip/rls/tiprpt/countries/2017/271178.htm|website=U.S. Department of State|accessdate=9 March 2018}}{{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Djiboutian and migrant women and street children are vulnerable to sex trafficking in Djibouti City, the [[Ethiopia]]-Djibouti trucking corridor, and [[Obock]], the main departure point for Yemen. Some migrants intending to be smuggled may be transported or detained against their will and subsequently subjected to trafficking and other forms of abuse in Djibouti. Some migrant women reportedly were subjected to domestic servitude and [[forced prostitution]] in Djibouti.&lt;ref name="state17" /&gt;

The 2016 Law No. 133, On the Fight Against Trafficking in Persons and Illicit Smuggling of Migrants, criminalizes all forms of trafficking; it prescribes penalties of five to 10 years imprisonment, and 20 when aggravating factors are present, which are sufficiently stringent and commensurate with those for other serious crime.&lt;ref name="state17" /&gt;

The [[United States Department of State]] [[Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons]] ranks Djibouti as a '[[Trafficking in Persons Report#Ranking System|Tier 2]]' country.&lt;ref name="state18"&gt;{{cite web |title=Djibouti 2018 Trafficking in Persons Report |url=https://www.state.gov/j/tip/rls/tiprpt/countries/2018/282645.htm |website=U.S. Department of State |accessdate=29 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''record label''', or '''record company''', is a brand or trademark associated with the marketing of [[Sound recording and reproduction|music recordings]] and [[music videos]]. Sometimes, a record label is also a [[Music publisher (popular music)|publishing]] company that manages such brands and trademarks, coordinates the production, [[manufacturing|manufacture]], [[distribution (business)|distribution]], marketing, promotion, and enforcement of [[copyright]] for sound recordings and music videos; also conducting talent scouting and development of new artists ("artists and repertoire" or "[[A&amp;amp;R]]"); and maintains [[Recording contract|contracts]] with recording artists and their managers. The term "record label" derives from the circular label in the center of a vinyl record which prominently displays the manufacturer's name, along with other information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Klein |first=Allison |url=http://howstuffworks.com/record-label1.htm |title=How Record Labels Work |website=HowStuffWorks.com |date= |accessdate=29 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Music industry==
{{Unreferenced section|date=June 2018}}
Within the mainstream [[music industry]], recording artists have traditionally been reliant upon record labels to broaden their consumer base, market their albums, and be both promoted and heard on music streaming services, radio, and television. Record labels provide [[publicist]]s, who assist performers in gaining positive media coverage, and arrange for their merchandise to be available via stores and other media outlets.

But an increasing number of artists have sought to avoid costs and gain new audiences via the Internet, often with the help of [[music video|videos]]. Combined with the decline in album sales and rapid growth in free content available online, this has changed the way the industry works dramatically since the beginning of the 21st century. It has caused record labels to seek new sources of profit, in particular via "360" deals (see below, under "new label strategies").

==Major versus independent record labels==
Record labels may be small, localized and "[[independent record label|independent]]" ("indie"), or they may be part of a large [[multinational corporation|international media group]], or somewhere in between. The [[Association of Independent Music]] (AIM) defines a 'major' as "a multinational company which (together with the companies in its group) has more than 5% of the world market(s) for the sale of records or music videos." As of 2012, there are only three labels that can be referred to as "major labels" ([[Universal Music Group]], [[Sony Music Entertainment]], and [[Warner Music Group]]). In 2014 AIM estimated that the majors had a collective global market share of some 65-70%.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.musicindie.com/independent-music-now-growing-force-global-market/&lt;/ref&gt; 

A "[[Record label#Sublabel|sublabel]]" is a label that is part of a larger record company but trades under a different name.

==Imprint==
A label used as a trademark or brand and not a company is called an [[Imprint (trade name)|imprint]], a term used for the same concept in [[publishing]]. An imprint is sometimes marketed as being a "project", "unit", or "division" of a record label company, even though there is no legal business structure associated with the imprint.

==Independent==
{{Main|Independent record label}}
Record companies and music publishers that are not under the control of the big three are generally considered to be ''independent'' (''[[indie (music)|indie]]''), even if they are large corporations with complex structures. The term ''indie label'' is sometimes used to refer to only those independent labels that adhere to independent criteria of corporate structure and size, and some consider an indie label to be almost any label that releases non-mainstream music, regardless of its corporate structure.

Independent labels are often considered more artist-friendly. Though they may have less financial clout, indie labels typically offer larger artist royalty with 50% profit-share agreement, aka 50-50 deal, not uncommon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://musicians.about.com/od/musicindustrybasics/tp/indielabelessons.htm |title=Top Five Lessons Learned from Indie Record Labels |website=Musicians.about.com |date= |accessdate=29 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sublabel==
Music collectors often use the term ''sublabel'' to refer to either an imprint or a subordinate label company (such as those within a group). For example, in the 1980s and 1990s, "4th &amp; B'way" was a trademarked brand owned by [[Island Records]] Ltd. in the UK and by a subordinate branch, Island Records, Inc., in the United States. The center label on a 4th &amp; Broadway record marketed in the [[United States]] would typically bear a 4th &amp; B'way logo and would state in the fine print, "4th &amp; B'way™, an Island Records, Inc. company". Collectors discussing labels as brands would say that 4th &amp; B'way is a sublabel or imprint of just "Island" or "Island Records". Similarly, collectors who choose to treat corporations and trademarks as equivalent might say 4th &amp; B'way is an imprint and/or sublabel of both Island Records, Ltd. and that company's sublabel, Island Records, Inc. However, such definitions are complicated by the corporate [[Mergers and acquisitions|merger]]s that occurred in 1989 (when Island was sold to PolyGram) and 1998 (when PolyGram merged with Universal). Island remained registered as corporations in both the [[United States]] and [[United Kingdom|UK]], but control of its brands changed hands multiple times as new companies were formed, diminishing the corporation's distinction as the "parent" of any sublabels.

==Vanity labels==
{{Main|Vanity label}}
Vanity labels are labels that bear an imprint that gives the impression of an artist's ownership or control, but in fact represent a standard artist/label relationship. In such an arrangement, the artist will control nothing more than the usage of the name on the label, but may enjoy a greater say in the packaging of his or her work. An example of such a label is the Neutron label owned by [[ABC (band)|ABC]] while at [[Phonogram Inc.]] in the UK. At one point artist Lizzie Tear (under contract with ABC themselves) appeared on the imprint, but it was devoted almost entirely to ABC's offerings and is still used for their re-releases (though Phonogram owns the masters of all the work issued on the label).

However, not all labels dedicated to particular artists are completely superficial in origin. Many artists, early in their careers, create their own labels which are later bought out by a bigger company. If this is the case it can sometimes give the artist greater freedom than if they were signed directly to the big label. There are many examples of this kind of label, such as [[Nothing Records]], owned by [[Trent Reznor]] of [[Nine Inch Nails]]; and Morning Records, owned by the [[Cooper Temple Clause]], who were releasing EPs for years before the company was bought by [[RCA]].

==Relationship with artists==
A label typically enters into an exclusive [[recording contract]] with an artist to market the artist's recordings in return for [[Music royalties|royalties]] on the selling price of the recordings. Contracts may extend over short or long durations, and may or may not refer to specific recordings. Established, successful artists tend to be able to renegotiate their contracts to get terms more favorable to them, but [[Prince (musician)|Prince]]'s much-publicized 1994–1996 feud with [[Warner Bros. Records]] provides a strong counterexample,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Newman|first1=Melinda|title=Inside Prince's Career-Long Battle to Master His Artistic Destiny|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/cover-story/7348551/prince-battle-to-control-career-artist-rights|website=Billboard|accessdate=3 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; as does [[Roger McGuinn]]'s claim, made in July 2000 before a US Senate committee, that [[the Byrds]] never received any of the royalties they had been promised for their biggest hits, "[[Mr.&amp;nbsp;Tambourine Man]]" and "[[Turn! Turn! Turn! (to Everything There Is a Season)|Turn! Turn!, Turn!]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0007/11/se.01.html | title=CNN Transcript – Special Event: Lars Ulrich, Roger McGuinn Testify Before Senate Judiciary Committee on Downloading Music on the Internet|date=11 July 2000|website=Transcripts.cnn.com|accessdate=29 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A contract either provides for the artist to deliver completed recordings to the label, or for the label to undertake the recording with the artist. For artists without a recording history, the label is often involved in selecting producers, [[recording studio]]s, additional musicians, and songs to be recorded, and may supervise the output of recording sessions. For established artists, a label is usually less involved in the recording process.

The relationship between record labels and artists can be a difficult one. Many artists have had albums altered or censored in some way by the labels before they are released—songs being edited, artwork or titles being changed, etc.{{Citation needed|date=December 2012}}  Record labels generally do this because they believe that the album will sell better if the changes are made.  Often the record label's decisions are prudent ones from a commercial perspective, but this typically frustrates the artists who feels that their art is being diminished or misrepresented by such actions.

In the early days of the recording industry, recording labels were absolutely necessary for the success of any artist.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} The first goal of any new artist or band was to get signed to a contract as soon as possible. In the 1940s, 1950s, and 1960s, many artists were so desperate to sign a contract with a record company that they sometimes ended up signing agreements in which they sold the rights to their recordings to the record label in perpetuity. [[Entertainment law]]yers are usually employed by artists to discuss contract terms.

Through the advances of the Internet the role of labels is becoming increasingly changed, as artists are able to freely distribute their own material through web radio, peer to peer file sharing such as [[BitTorrent]], and other services, for little or no cost but with little financial return. Established artists, such as Nine Inch Nails, whose career was developed with major label backing, announced an end to their major label contracts, citing that the uncooperative nature of the recording industry with these new trends are hurting musicians, fans and the industry as a whole.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sputnikmusic.com/news.php?newsid=4504 |title=Nine inch nails = independent |website=Sputnikmusic.com |date= |accessdate=29 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nine Inch Nails later returned to working with a major label,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.spin.com/2013/08/trent-reznor-nine-inch-nails-hesitation-marks-columbia-spin-september-2013-cover-story/ |title=Trent Reznor on Nine Inch Nails' Columbia Signing: ‘I'm Not a Major Label Apologist' |website=Spin.com |date=19 August 2013 |accessdate=29 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; admitting that they needed the international marketing and promotional reach that a major label can provide. [[Radiohead]] also cited similar motives with the end of their contract with [[EMI]] when their album ''[[In Rainbows]]'' was released as a "[[pay what you want]]" sales model as an online download, but they also returned to a label for a conventional release.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.nme.com/news/radiohead/32207 |title=Radiohead sign 'conventional' record deal |website=Nme.com |date=31 October 2007 |accessdate=29 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research shows that record labels still control most access to distribution.&lt;ref&gt;

==New label strategies==
With the advancement of the computer and technology such as the Internet, leading to an increase in file sharing and [[Direct-to-Fan|direct-to-fan]] digital distribution, combined with music sales plummeting in recent years,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Covert |first=Adrian |url=http://money.cnn.com/2013/04/25/technology/itunes-music-decline/ |title=A decade of iTunes singles killed the music industry - Apr. 25, 2013 |website=Money.cnn.com |date=25 April 2013 |accessdate=29 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; labels and organizations have had to change their strategies and the way they work with artists. New types of deals are being made with artists called "multiple rights" or "360" deals with artists. These types of pacts give labels rights and percentages to artist's touring, merchandising, and [[Testimonial|endorsement]]s. In exchange for these rights, labels usually give higher advance payments to artists, have more patience with artist development, and pay higher percentages of CD sales. These 360 deals are most effective when the artist is established and has a loyal fan base. For that reason, labels now have to be more relaxed with the development of artists because longevity is the key to these types of pacts. Several artists such as [[Paramore]], [[Maino]], and even [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]] have signed such types of deals.

A look at an actual 360 deal offered by [[Atlantic Records]] to an artist shows a variation of the structure. Atlantic's document offers a conventional cash advance to sign the artist, who would receive a royalty for sales after expenses were recouped. With the release of the artist's first album, however, the label has an option to pay an additional $200,000 in exchange for 30 percent of the net income from all touring, merchandise, endorsements, and fan-club fees. Atlantic would also have the right to approve the act's tour schedule, and the salaries of certain tour and merchandise sales employees hired by the artist. But the label also offers the artist a 30 percent cut of the label's album profits—if any—which represents an improvement from the typical industry royalty of 15 percent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Leeds |first=Jeff |title=The New Deal: Band as Brand |date=11 November 2004 |publisher=Nytimes.com |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/11/11/arts/music/11leed.html?pagewanted=1&amp;_r=1&amp;adxnnlx=1269741649-euWFoDdXtDDM3tqfY5XwQQ }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
===Industry consolidation===
In the 1970s and 1980s, there was a phase of consolidation in the record industry that led to almost all major labels being owned by a very few multinational companies. CDs still flow through a handful of sources, with the majority of the sales going through the "big three" record labels.

===Resurgence of independent labels===
In the 1990s, as a result of the widespread use of home studios, consumer recording technology, and the Internet, independent labels began to become more commonplace. Independent labels are often artist-owned (although not always), with a stated intent often being to control the quality of the artist's output. Independent labels usually do not enjoy the resources available to the "big three" and as such will often lag behind them in market shares. Often independent artists manage a return by recording for a much smaller production cost of a typical big label release. Sometimes they are able to recoup their initial advance even with much lower sales numbers.

On occasion, established artists, once their record contract has finished, move to an independent label. This often gives the combined advantage of name recognition and more control over one's music along with a larger portion of royalty profits. Artists such as [[Dolly Parton]], [[Aimee Mann]], [[Prince (musician)|Prince]], [[Public Enemy (band)|Public Enemy]], BKBravo (Kua and Rafi), among others, have done this. Historically, companies started in this manner have been re-absorbed into the major labels (two examples are American singer [[Frank Sinatra]]'s [[Reprise Records]], which has been owned by [[Warner Music Group]] for some time now, and musician [[Herb Alpert]]'s [[A&amp;M Records]], now owned by Universal Music Group). Similarly, [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]]'s Maverick Records (started by Madonna with her manager and another partner) was to come under control of Warner Music when Madonna [[divest]]ed herself of controlling shares in the company.

Some independent labels become successful enough that major record companies negotiate contracts to either distribute music for the label or in some cases, purchase the label completely.

On the [[punk rock]] scene, the [[DIY ethic]] encourages bands to self-publish and self-distribute. This approach evolved out of necessity around since the early 1980s, due to the major labels' aversion to signing the punk rock bands that spawned after the initial wave in the mid-70s. Such labels have a reputation for being fiercely uncompromising and especially unwilling to cooperate with the [[World music market|big record labels]] at all. One of the most notable and influential labels of the Do-It-Yourself attitude was [[SST Records]], created by the band [[Black Flag (band)|Black Flag]]. No labels wanted to release their material, so they simply created their own label to release not only their own material but the material of many other influential underground bands all over the country. [[Ian MacKaye]]'s [[Dischord Records|Dischord]] is often cited as a model of success in the DIY community, having survived for over thirty years with less than twelve employees at any one time.

===Internet and digital labels===
{{Main|Netlabel}}
With the Internet now being a viable source for obtaining music, [[netlabel]]s have emerged. Depending on the ideals of the net label, music files from the artists may be downloaded free of charge or for a fee that is paid via [[PayPal]] or other online payment system. Some of these labels also offer hard copy CDs in addition to direct download.  Digital Labels are the latest version of a 'net' label. Whereas 'net' labels were started as a free site, digital labels are more competition for the major record labels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Suhr|first1=Cecilia|title=Understanding the Hegemonic Struggle between Mainstream Vs.

===Open-source labels===
{{Main|Open-source record label}}
The new century brought the phenomenon of ''open-source'' or ''open-content'' record label. These are inspired by the [[free software]] and [[open source]] movements and the success of [[Linux|GNU/Linux]].

===Publishers as labels===
In the mid-2000s, some music publishing companies began undertaking the work traditionally done by labels. The publisher Sony/ATV Music, for example, leveraged its connections within the Sony family to produce, record, distribute, and promote [[Elliott Yamin]]'s debut album under a dormant Sony-owned imprint, rather than waiting for a deal with a proper label.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|magazine=Billboard|title=Publisher = Label? – Sony/ATV Music releases; Elliott Yamin's record|date=31 March 2007|last=Butler|first=Susan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Major labels==
{{Timeline of Major Record Labels}}

Record labels are often under the control of a corporate umbrella organization called a "music [[Corporate group|group]]". A music group is typically owned by an international [[conglomerate (company)|conglomerate]] "[[holding company]]", which often has non-music divisions as well. A music group controls and consists of music publishing companies, record (sound recording) manufacturers, record distributors, and record labels. Record companies (manufacturers, distributors, and labels) may also constitute a "record group" which is, in turn, controlled by a music group. The constituent companies in a music group or record group are sometimes marketed as being "divisions" of the group.

{{Anchor|Major labels 1988–1999 (Big Six)}}From 1988 to 1999, there were six major record labels, known as the Big Six:{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}
# [[Warner Music Group]]
# [[EMI]]
# [[Sony Music]] (known as CBS Records until January 1991)
# [[Bertelsmann Music Group|BMG]]
# [[Universal Music Group]]
# [[PolyGram]]

{{Anchor|Major labels 1999–2004 (Big Five)}}PolyGram was merged into UMG in 1999, leaving the rest to be known as the Big Five.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

{{Anchor|Major labels 2004–2012 (Big Four)}}In 2004, Sony and BMG agreed to a joint venture to create the [[Sony BMG]] label (which would be renamed Sony Music Entertainment after a 2008 merger). In 2007, the four remaining companies—known as the Big Four—controlled about 70% of the [[world music market]], and about 80% of the United States music market.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.copynot.org/Pages/The%20big%20four%20Record%20Companies.html |title=Copyright Law, Treaties and Advice |publisher=Copynot.org |accessdate=14 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.apple.com/fr/hotnews/thoughtsonmusic/ ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140328020555/https://www.apple.com/fr/hotnews/thoughtsonmusic/ |date=28 March 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the '''retention of vision vanish''', the [[Magic (illusion)|magician]] places a [[coin]] or small object between the fingers and the thumb of the right hand. The left hand is palm up with the palm slightly tilted towards the audience. The right approaches and displays the object on the left palm for a second or so, held on opposite sides of a diameter. Then the right hand moves away empty as the fingers of the left hand close over the object. After a brief pause the left hand is shown empty and the coin has disappeared. In some versions the right hand can also be seen empty, leaving no clue as to where the coin went.

Originally attributed to [[T. Nelson Downs]], a famous magician from the late [[Victorian era|Victorian]] and [[Edwardian era]]s who specialised in coins, the vanish has been improved by [[Dai Vernon]] and many other 20th-century magicians who all added variations to improve the original concept that an object displayed for a short length of time leaves an image on the [[retina]] that may persist for a further short time after the object has actually disappeared.

'''Sound design''' is the art and practice of creating sound tracks for a variety of needs. It involves specifying, acquiring or creating auditory elements using audio production techniques and tools. It is employed in a variety of disciplines including [[filmmaking]], [[television production]], [[video game development]], [[theatre]], [[sound recording and reproduction]], [[Concert|live performance]], [[sound art]], [[post-production]], [[Radio broadcasting|radio]] and [[musical instrument]] development. Sound design commonly involves performing (see e.g. [[Foley (filmmaking)|foley]]) and editing of previously composed or recorded audio, such as sound effects and dialogue for the purposes of the medium. A '''sound designer''' is one who practices sound design.

==History==
[[File:KDujardinsCommedia.jpg|thumb|Karel Dujardins, ''commedia dell'arte'' show, 1657]]
{{see also|Prehistoric Music}}
The use of sound to evoke emotion, reflect mood and underscore actions in plays and dances began in [[prehistoric]] times. At its earliest, it was used in religious practices for healing or recreation. In ancient Japan, theatrical events called ''[[kagura]]'' were performed in [[Shinto shrine]]s with music and dance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Brazell | first = Karen | year = 1999 | title = Traditional Japanese Theater | publisher = Columbia University Press | isbn = 0-231-10873-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Plays were performed in medieval times in a form of theatre called ''[[Commedia dell'arte]]'', which used music and sound effects to enhance performances. The use of music and sound in the [[English Renaissance theatre|Elizabethan Theatre]] followed, in which music and sound effects were produced off stage using devices such as bells, whistles, and horns. Cues would be written in the script for music and sound effects to be played at the appropriate time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Kaye | first1 = Deena | last2 = Lebrecht | first2 = James | year = 1992 | title = Sound and Music For The Theatre | publisher = Back Stage Books, an imprint of Watson-Guptill Publications | isbn = 0-8230-7664-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Italian composer [[Luigi Russolo]] built mechanical sound-making devices, called "[[intonarumori]]," for [[futurism (music)|futurist]] theatrical and music performances starting around 1913. These devices were meant to simulate natural and man-made sounds, such as trains and bombs. Russolo's treatise, [[The Art of Noises]], is one of the earliest written documents on the use of abstract noise in the theatre. After his death, his intonarumori' were used in more conventional theatre performances to create realistic sound effects.

===Recorded sound===
Possibly the first use of recorded sound in the theatre was a phonograph playing a baby’s cry in a London theatre in 1890.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Booth | first = Michael R. | year = 1991 | title = Theatre In The Victorian | publisher = Cambridge University Press | isbn = 0-521-34837-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Sixteen years later, [[Herbert Beerbohm Tree]] used recordings in his London production of Stephen Phillips’ tragedy NERO. The event is marked in the Theatre Magazine (1906) with two photographs; one showing a musician blowing a bugle into a large horn attached to a disc recorder, the other with an actor recording the agonizing shrieks and groans of the tortured martyrs. The article states: “these sounds are all realistically reproduced by the gramophone”. As cited by [[Bertolt Brecht]], there was a play about [[Rasputin]] written in (1927) by [[Alexej Tolstoi]] and directed by [[Erwin Piscator]] that included a recording of [[Lenin]]'s voice. Whilst the term "sound designer" was not in use at this time, a number of stage managers specialised as "effects men", creating and performing offstage sound effects using a mix of vocal mimicry, mechanical and electrical contraptions and gramophone records. A great deal of care and attention was paid to the construction and performance of these effects, both naturalistic and abstract.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Napier | first = Frank | year = 1936 | title = Noises Off | publisher = Frederick Muller }}&lt;/ref&gt; Over the course of the twentieth century the use of recorded sound effects began to take over from live sound effects, though often it was the [[Stage management|stage manager]]'s duty to find the [[sound effect]]s and an [[electrician]] played the recordings during performances.

Between 1980 and 1988, [[Charlie Richmond (inventor)|Charlie Richmond]], USITT's first Sound Design Commissioner, oversaw efforts of their [[Sound Design Commission]] to define the duties, responsibilities, standards and procedures which might normally be expected of a theatre sound designer in [[North America]].  This subject is still regularly discussed by that group, but during that time, substantial conclusions were drawn and he wrote a [https://web.archive.org/web/20070308153444/http://www.richmondsounddesign.com/txt/sound-design.txt document] which, although now somewhat dated, provides a succinct record of what was expected at that time.  It was subsequently provided to both the ADC and David Goodman at the Florida USA local when they were both planning to represent sound designers in the 1990s.

===Digital technology===
[[File:Tainted blue studios control room.jpg|thumb|Modern digital control room at Tainted Blue Studios, 2010]]
[[Musical Instrument Digital Interface|MIDI]] and [[digital audio]] technology have contributed to the evolution of sound production techniques in the 1980s and 1990s. [[Digital audio workstation]]s and a variety of digital signal processing algorithms applied in them allow more complicated sound tracks with more tracks as well as auditory effects to be realized. Features such as unlimited undo and sample-level editing allow fine control over the sound tracks.

In [[theatre sound]], features of computerized theatre sound design systems have also been recognized as being essential for live [[show control]] systems at [[Walt Disney World]] and, as a result, Disney utilized systems of that type to control many facilities at their ''[[Disney's Hollywood Studios|Disney-MGM Studios]]'' theme park, which opened in 1989. These features were incorporated into the [[MIDI Show Control]] (MSC) specification, an open [[communications protocol]] used to interact with diverse devices. The first show to fully utilize the MSC specification was the [[Magic Kingdom Parade]] at [[Walt Disney World]]'s [[Magic Kingdom]] in September, 1991.

The rise of interest in game audio has also brought more advanced interactive audio tools that are also accessible without a background in computer programming. Some of such software tools (termed "implementation tools" or "audio engines") feature a workflow that's similar to that in more conventional [[digital audio workstation]] programs and can also allow the sound production personnel to undertake some of the more creative interactive sound tasks (that are considered to be part of sound design for computer applications) that previously would have required a computer programmer. Interactive applications have also given rise to a plethora of techniques in "dynamic audio" that loosely means sound that's "parametrically" adjusted during the run-time of the program. This allows for a broader expression in sounds, more similar to that in films, because this way the sound designer can e.g. create footstep sounds that vary in a believable and non-repeating way and that also corresponds to what's seen in the picture. The digital audio workstation cannot directly "communicate" with game engines, because the game's events occur often in an unpredictable order, whereas traditional digital audio workstations as well as so called linear media (TV, film etc.) have everything occur in the same order every time the production is run. Especially games have also brought in dynamic or adaptive mixing.

The [[World Wide Web]] has greatly enhanced the ability of sound designers to acquire source material quickly, easily and cheaply.  Nowadays, a designer can preview and download crisper, more "believable" sounds as opposed to toiling through time- and budget-draining "shot-in-the-dark" searches through record stores, libraries and "the grapevine" for (often) inferior recordings.  In addition, software innovation has enabled sound designers to take more of a [[DIY|DIY (or "do-it-yourself")]] approach.  From the comfort of their home and at any hour, they can simply use a computer, speakers and headphones rather than renting (or buying) costly equipment or studio space and time for editing and mixing.  This provides for faster creation and negotiation with the director.

==Applications==

===Film===
{{See also|Sound editor (filmmaking)|Foley artist|Director of audiography}}
In motion picture production, a ''Sound Editor/Designer'' is a member of a [[film crew]] responsible for the entirety or some specific parts of a film's sound track.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sound designer|url=http://filmsound.org/terminology/designer.htm|website=FilmSound.org|accessdate=13 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Cinema of the United States|American film industry]], the title ''Sound Designer'' is not controlled by any professional organization, unlike titles such as [[film director|Director]] or [[Screenwriter]].

The terms ''sound design'' and ''sound designer'' began to be used in the motion picture industry in 1969.  At that time, The title of ''Sound Designer'' was first granted to [[Walter Murch]] by [[Francis Ford Coppola]] in recognition for Murch's contributions to the film [[The Rain People]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Ondaatje |first1=Michael |last2=Murch |first2=Walter |title=The conversations: Walter Murch and the art of editing film |date=2003 |publisher=Bloomsbury |location=London |page=53}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The original meaning of the title ''Sound Designer'', as established by Coppola and Murch, was "an individual ultimately responsible for all aspects of a film's audio track, from the [[dialogue]] and [[sound effects]] recording to the [[re-recording (sound/film)|re-recording]] (mix) of the final track".&lt;ref name=reeves&gt;{{cite web|last1=Reeves|first1=Alex|title=A Brief History of Sound Design|url=http://www.theawsc.com/2014/01/31/a-brief-history-of-sound-design/|website=Advertising Week Social Club|publisher=Advertising Week|accessdate=13 October 2015|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304084311/http://www.theawsc.com/2014/01/31/a-brief-history-of-sound-design/|archivedate=4 March 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The term ''sound designer'' has replaced monikers like ''supervising sound editor'' or ''re-recording mixer'' for what was essentially the same position: the head designer of the final sound track.  Editors and mixers like Murray Spivack (''King Kong''), George Groves (''The Jazz Singer''), James G. Stewart (''Citizen Kane''), and Carl Faulkner (''Journey to the Center of the Earth'') served in this capacity during Hollywood's studio era, and are generally considered to be sound designers by a different name.

The advantage of calling oneself a sound designer beginning in later decades was two-fold.  It strategically allowed for a single person to work as both an editor and mixer on a film without running into issues pertaining to the jurisdictions of editors and mixers, as outlined by their respective unions.  Additionally, it was a rhetorical move that legitimated the field of post-production sound at a time when studios were down-sizing their sound departments, and when producers were routinely skimping on budgets and salaries for sound editors and mixers. In so doing, it allowed those who called themselves sound designers to compete for contract work and to negotiate higher salaries.  The position of Sound Designer therefore emerged in a manner similar to that of [[Production Designer]], which was created in the 1930s when [[William Cameron Menzies]] made revolutionary contributions to the craft of [[art director|art direction]] in the making of ''[[Gone with the Wind (film)|Gone with the Wind]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bordwell|first1=David|title=William Cameron Menzies: One Forceful, Impressive Idea|url=http://www.davidbordwell.net/essays/menzies.php|website=davidbordwell.net|accessdate=13 October 2015}}{{sps|date=July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The audio production team is a principal member of the production staff, with creative output comparable to that of the [[film editor]] and [[director of photography]]. Several factors have led to the promotion of audio production to this level, when previously it was considered subordinate to other parts of film:

* [[movie theater|Cinema]] [[Sound reinforcement system|sound system]]s became capable of [[high-fidelity]] reproduction, particularly after the adoption of [[Dolby Stereo]]. These systems were originally devised as gimmicks to increase theater attendance, but their widespread implementation created a content vacuum that had to be filled by competent professionals. Before stereo soundtracks, film sound was of such low fidelity that only the dialogue and occasional sound effects were practical. The greater dynamic range of the new systems, coupled with the ability to produce sounds at the sides or behind the audience, provided the audio production team new opportunities for creative expression in film sound.
* Some directors were interested in realizing the new potentials of the medium. A new generation of filmmakers, the so-called "[[Easy Riders and Raging Bulls]]"—[[Martin Scorsese]], [[Steven Spielberg]], [[George Lucas]], and others—were aware of the creative potential of sound and wanted to use it.
* Filmmakers were inspired by the [[popular music]] of the era. [[Concept albums]] of groups such as [[Pink Floyd]] and [[The Beatles]] suggested new modes of storytelling and creative techniques that could be adapted to motion pictures.
* New filmmakers made their early films outside the [[Hollywood]] [[the establishment|establishment]], away from the influence of film [[labor union]]s and the then rapidly dissipating [[studio system]].

The contemporary title of ''sound designer'' can be compared with the more traditional title of ''[[supervising sound editor]]''; many sound designers use both titles interchangeably.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Müller|first1=Bastian|title=Sound Design: The Development of Sound Design for Hollywood Films and its Impact on Modern Cinema|date=2008|publisher=diplom.de|location=Hamburg|isbn=9783836618922|page=24|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2fpxAQAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=13 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The role of ''supervising sound editor'', or ''sound supervisor'', developed in parallel with the role of '''sound designer'''. The demand for more sophisticated soundtracks was felt both inside and outside Hollywood, and the '''supervising sound editor''' became the head of the large sound department, with a staff of dozens of [[Sound editor (filmmaking)|sound editor]]s, that was required to realize a complete sound job with a fast turnaround.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hollyn|first1=Norman|title=The Film Editing Room Handbook: How to Tame the Chaos of the Editing Room|date=2009|publisher=Peachpit Press|location=Berkeley CA|isbn=0321679520|page=144|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IRSq9qWQeMIC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=13 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=dakic&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dakic|first1=Vesna|title=Sound Design for Film and Television|date=2009|publisher=GRIN Verlag|location=Norderstedt|isbn=9783640454792|page=2|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wSVPl1TSOm8C&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=13 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sound design, as a distinct discipline, is one of the youngest fields in [[stagecraft]], second only to the use of [[Digital cinema|projection]] and other [[multimedia]] displays, although the ideas and techniques of sound design have been around almost since theatre started. [[Dan Dugan (audio engineer)|Dan Dugan]], working with three stereo tape decks routed to ten loudspeaker zones&lt;ref name=AES1969&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.aes.org/e-lib/browse.cfm?elib=1540 |title=A New Music and Sound Effects System for Theatrical Productions |last=Dugan |first=Dan |date=December 1969 |work=Journal of the Audio Engineering Society |volume=17 |number=6 |pages=666–670 |publisher=[[Audio Engineering Society]] |accessdate=March 23, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; during the 1968–69 season of [[American Conservatory Theater]] (ACT) in San Francisco, was the first person to be called a sound designer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=Deena |last1=Kaye |first2=James |last2=LeBrecht |title=Sound and music for the theatre: the art and technique of design |publisher=Focal Press |year=2009 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=l2gHgjAjGPYC&amp;pg=PT31 |page=8 |isbn=0-240-81011-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern audio technology has enabled theatre sound designers to produce flexible, complex, and inexpensive designs that can be easily integrated into live performance. The influence of film and television on playwriting is seeing plays being written increasingly with shorter scenes, which is difficult to achieve with scenery but easily conveyed with sound. The development of film sound design is giving writers and directors higher expectations and knowledge of sound design. Consequently, theatre sound design is widespread and accomplished sound designers commonly establish long-term collaborations with directors.

====Musicals====
Sound design for [[musical theatre|musicals]] often focuses on the design and implementation of a sound reinforcement system that will fulfill the needs of the production. If a sound system is already installed in the performance venue, it is the sound designer's job to tune the system for the best use for a particular production. Sound system tuning employs various methods including [[equalization (audio)|equalization]], delay, volume, speaker and [[microphone]] placement, and in some cases, the addition of new equipment. In conjunction with the director and musical director, if any, the sound reinforcement designer determines the use and placement of microphones for actors and musicians. The sound reinforcement designer ensures that the performance can be heard and understood by everyone in the audience, regardless of the shape, size or acoustics of the venue, and that performers can hear everything needed to enable them to do their jobs. While sound design for a musical largely focuses on the artistic merits of sound reinforcement, many musicals, such as ''Into the Woods'' also require significant sound scores (see Sound Design for Plays). Sound Reinforcement Design was recognized by the American Theatre Wing's Tony Awards with the Tony Award for Best Sound Design of a Musical until the 2014-15 season,&lt;ref name="2010-2011 Tony Award Rules"&gt;{{cite web|title=2010-2011 Tony Award Rules|url=http://www.tonyawards.com/en_US/about/Rules-2010-2011FINAL.pdf|publisher=American Theatre Wing|accessdate=26 December 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120319152200/http://www.tonyawards.com/en_US/about/Rules-2010-2011FINAL.pdf|archivedate=19 March 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; later reinstating in the 2017-18 season.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.tonyawards.com/en_US/news/articles/2017-04-24/best_sound_design_categories_to_return_to_the_tony_awards.html|title=Best Sound Design Categories to Return to the Tony Awards|website=TonyAwards.com|language=en|access-date=2017-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Plays====
Sound design for plays often involves the selection of music and sounds (sound score) for a production based on intimate familiarity with the play, and the design, installation, calibration and utilization of the sound system that reproduces the sound score. The sound designer for a play and the production's [[theater director|director]] work together to decide the themes and emotions to be explored. Based on this, the sound designer for plays, in collaboration with the director and possibly the composer, decides upon the sounds that will be used to create the desired moods. In some productions, the sound designer might also be hired to compose music for the play. The sound designer and the director usually work together to "spot" the cues in the play (i.e., decide when and where sound will be used in the play). Some productions might use music only during scene changes, whilst others might use sound effects. Likewise a scene might be underscored with music, sound effects or abstract sounds that exist somewhere between the two. Some sound designers are accomplished composers, writing and producing music for productions as well as designing sound. Many sound designs for plays also require significant sound reinforcement (see Sound Design for Musicals). Sound Design for plays was recognized by the American Theatre Wing's Tony Awards with the Tony Award for Best Sound Design of a Play until the 2014-15 season,&lt;ref name="2010-2011 Tony Award Rules"/&gt; later reinstating the award in the 2017-18 season.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

====Professional organizations====
* The Association of Sound Designers is a trade association representing theatre sound designers in the UK.
* United Scenic Artists (USA) Local USA829, which is integrated within [[IATSE]], represents theatrical sound designers in the United States.
* Theatrical Sound Designers in English Canada are represented by the Associated Designers of Canada (ADC), and in Québec by l'Association des professionnels des arts du Québec (APASQ).

===Music===
In contemporary music business, especially in the production of [[rock music]], [[ambient music]], [[progressive rock]], and similar [[genre]]s, the [[record producer]] and [[recording engineer]] play important roles in the creation of the overall sound (or [[soundscape]]) of a recording, and less often, of a live performance. A record producer is responsible for extracting the best performance possible from the musicians and for making both musical and technical decisions about the instrumental timbres, arrangements, etc. On some, particularly more electronic music projects, artists and producers in more conventional genres have sometimes sourced additional help from artists often credited as "sound designers", to contribute specific auditory effects, ambiences etc. to the production. These people are usually more versed in e.g. electronic music composition and synthesizers than the other musicians on board.

In application of electroacoustic techniques (e.g. binaural sound) and sound synthesis for contemporary music or film music, a sound designer (often also an electronic musician) sometimes refers to an artist who works alongside a composer to realize the more electronic aspects of a musical production. This is because sometimes there exists a difference in interests between artists calling themselves composers and artists calling themselves electronic musicians or sound designers. The latter being sometimes more experienced as well as interested in electronic music techniques, such as sequencing and synthesizers, but the former often wanting to use elements of electronic music in compositions but often being more experienced in writing music in a variety of genres. Since electronic music itself is quite broad in techniques and often separate from techniques applied in other genres, this kind of collaboration can be seen as fairly natural as well as beneficial.

Notable examples of (recognized) sound design in music are the contributions of [[Michael Brook]] to the [[U2]] album ''[[The Joshua Tree]]'', [[George Massenburg]] to the [[Jennifer Warnes]] album ''[[Famous Blue Raincoat]]'', [[Chris Thomas (record producer)|Chris Thomas]] to the [[Pink Floyd]] album ''[[The Dark Side of the Moon]]'', and [[Brian Eno]] to the [[Paul Simon]] album ''[[Surprise (Paul Simon album)|Surprise]]''.

In 1974,  [[Suzanne Ciani]] started her own production company, Ciani/Musica. Inc., which became the #1 sound design music house in New York.&lt;ref&gt;http://sevwave.com/electronic%20music.html&lt;/ref&gt;

===Computer applications and other applications===
Sound is widely used in a variety of [[human-computer interface]]s, in [[computer game]]s and [[video game]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference | first1 = Viviane | last1 = Gal | first2 = Cécile | last2 = Le Prado | first3 = J. B. | last3 = Merland | first4 = Stéphane | last4 = Natkin | first5 = Liliana | last5 = Vega | title = Processes and tools for sound design in computer games | booktitle = Proceedings of International Computer Music Conference | location = Goetborg | date = September 2002 | citeseerx = 10.1.1.78.5543 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | first1 = Olivier | last1 = Veneri | first2 = Stéphane | last2 = Natkin | first3 = Cécile | last3 = Le Prado | first4 = Marc | last4 = Emerit | title = A Game Audio Technology Overview | url = http://www.smcnetwork.org/files/proceedings/2006/10-A_Game_Audio_Technology_Overview.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; Sound production for computer applications adds few extra concerns and requirements to the sound. Some of them are: non-repetitiveness, interactivity/dynamicity and low memory and CPU use. For example, the most computational resources are usually devoted to graphics, which in turn means that the sound playback is often limited to some upper memory consumption as well as CPU use limits. These have to be added to the concerns of audio production, since it is often not enough to merely "create good sound", but the sound also has to fit to the given computational limits, while still sounding good, which may require e.g. the use of audio compression or voice allocating systems. However, sound for computer applications also adds some new creative aspects to music and sound, because computer sound (especially in games) often involves the sound having or desired to be ''interactive''. Adding interactivity can involve using a variety of playback systems or logic, using tools that allow the production of interactive sound (e.g. Max/MSP, Wwise) and it also deviates from being just an art form to also requiring software or electrical engineering, since implementing interactivity of sound also requires engineering of the systems that play the sound or e.g. process user input. Therefore, in interactive applications, a sound designer often collaborates with an engineer (e.g. a sound programmer) who's concerned with designing the playback systems and their efficiency.

==Awards==
Sound designers have been recognized by awards organizations for some time, and new awards have emerged more recently in response to advances in sound design technology and quality. The [[Motion Picture Sound Editors]] and the [[Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences]] recognizes the finest or most aesthetic sound design for a film with the Golden Reel Award for Sound and Music editing, and the [[Academy Award for Best Sound Editing]] respectively. In 2007, the [[Tony Award for Best Sound Design]] was created to honor the best sound design in American theatre on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Starting in 2007-08, Sound Designers Will Be Recognized by Tony Awards | url = http://www.playbill.com/news/article/108956.html | date = 19 Jun 2007 | first = Kenneth | last = Jones | work = Playbill.com | access-date = 2008-06-23 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20070626051746/http://www.playbill.com/news/article/108956.html# | archive-date = 2007-06-26 | dead-url = yes | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

North American theatrical award organizations that recognize sound designers include these:
* [[Dora Mavor Moore Awards]]
* [[Drama Desk Awards]]
* [[Helen Hayes Awards Resident Design|Helen Hayes Awards]]
* [[Obie Awards]]
* [[Joseph Jefferson Awards]]

Major British award organizations include the [[Olivier Awards]]. The [[Tony Awards]] retired the awards for Sound Design as of the 2014-2015 season,&lt;ref&gt;Bowgen, Phillipe.

'''SportAvex''' is a contraction of '''Sport''' '''Av'''iation '''Ex'''position. It is a fly-in and [[air show]] organised by the Sport Aircraft Association [[New Zealand]] Incorporated (SAANZ).

This biennial event is the opportunity for homebuilders and other sport flyers to gather together and enjoy the spirit of camaraderie and competition with an [[aviation]] flavour. The event is held in alternate years with a similar but smaller event (Great Plains Flyin) held in the South Island.
Each year, the top [[homebuilt aircraft]] completed in the preceding year are judged and champions are named and honoured.
An [[airshow]] is conducted as part of the weekend's activities, featuring acts drawn from both the homebuilt/sport aviation and military aviation communities.

'''''The Clue!''''' (known as ''Der Clou!'' in German-speaking regions) is a [[Video game remake|remake]] of the 1986 game ''[[They Stole a Million]]''. It would form a two-game series, with a sequel following in 2001, under the guise of [[The Sting!]] or [[The Sting! (Video Game)|Der Clou 2!]]. In 2000 the [[source code]] was released to the public.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dlh.net/de/gaming-news/4522/der-clou!-quellcode-veroffentlicht.html Der Clou! Quellcode veröffentlicht] on dlh.net (in German, 13 July 2000)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.patje.de/2006/12/spieleklassiker-der-clou-1994/ Spieleklassiker: Der Clou (1994)] by Patrick Jedamzik (in German, 26 December 2006)&lt;/ref&gt; The game was since then ported to modern platforms ([[Windows]], [[Linux]]) via [[Simple DirectMedia Layer|SDL]] and receives still [[Patch (software)|updates]] by the game's community (2015).&lt;ref&gt;[http://cosp.sourceforge.net/ cosp.sourceforge.net/]&lt;/ref&gt;

An adventure game, assuming the identity of Matt Stuvysant, a [[burglar]] who is looking beyond just the clothes on his back and a hotel room on Holland Street,&lt;ref name="mobygames"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mobygames.com/game/dos/clue |title=The Clue! for DOS (1994) - MobyGames |work=MobyGames}}&lt;/ref&gt; the player is tasked with finding accomplices, scouting potential targets, and plotting plans of burglary, down to the finest detail. Featuring the archetypal [[point-and-click]] interface during investigations, engaging in planning a job would alter the controls to include keyboard, using it to control the planned movements of the personnel.

==Gameplay==
[[Image:TheClue-Planning.png|left|thumb|A Screenshot showing the planning of a robbery]]
''The Clue!'' is mixture of many video game genres. It can be described as [[role-playing]] [[adventure game]] with [[Tactic (method)#Other usages|tactical]]/[[strategy]] elements and [[puzzles]] in the form of [[burglaries]]. The gameplay is composed of two different modes - most of the time, the player is travelling around the city of London and talking with people using [[point-and-click]] interface like in classical adventure games, while more strategy-like [[top-down perspective]] is used for the actual planning of the heists.&lt;ref name="underdogs"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.the-underdogs.info/game.php?gameid=206|title=The-Underdogs.info|work=the-underdogs.info}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''adventure mode'' features static graphics depicting various places with menu interface to control Matt's actions. It is in this mode, where the player buys and sells cars, tools and other equipment needed for thievery, recruits accomplices and scouts for possible target buildings. Every important information as an amount of money, description of tools, cars, loot, etc. can be accessed anytime through the ''Think'' menu.&lt;ref name="abandonia"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abandonia.com/en/games/429/Clue!%2C+The.html |title=Download Clue!, The |work=[[Abandonia]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before committing a burglary, the player must collect all the necessary information by investigation of the site. A car and at least one associate with driving skills is also obligatory.

After these conditions have been fulfilled, the player can switch the game into the ''planning mode'' by selecting the option ''Planning'' in the hotel room.&lt;ref name="manual"&gt;Game manual&lt;/ref&gt; There he chooses the escape car, accomplices and the driver. In the final stage of planning, the player controls movement of the thieves by the keyboard and works out the details of the plan in real-time like simulation.

The [[Looting (gaming)|loot]] from successful coup must be sold to one of the three available dealers in order to earn money.&lt;ref name="abandonia"/&gt; Each dealer is specialized in different commodities and will not accept or will pay less for other types of merchandise.

Essential part of the gameplay are skills such as driving, [[lockpicking]] or electronics, which affects the time needed to complete specific tasks. Some actions and tools depend on particular skill level of person doing it&lt;ref name="abandonia"/&gt; (for example using [[stethoscope]] for opening a [[safe]] lock requies higher skill level than using a [[welding torch]] for the same job). Participants of a successful burglary also improve their skills. In addition to skills, each character has various personal traits as dexterity, loyalty, greed or nerves.&lt;ref name="manual"/&gt; These traits affect things like proportion of share from the loot, how many trails the person leaves on the crime scene or if he/she betrays his/her associates when captured by the police.

==Synopsis==

===Setting and characters===
[[Image:TheClue-HollandStreet.PNG|right|thumb|An in-game screenshot displaying the conversation with one of the game characters]]

The [[player character]] is Matt Stuvysant, a young criminal wanna-be getting immersed into the world of London underworld. He can make social contacts with other characters in various pubs and bars. Most of the [[Non-player character|NPCs]] can be hired to assist in burglary.

===Plot===
The story begins with Matt Stuvysant arriving to London Victoria station. Shortly after he is settled in the Ugly dog hotel on Holland street, he is contacted by his father's old friend Herbert Briggs, a well-renowned burglar.

'''Tony Clifton''' is a character created by performance artist [[Andy Kaufman]], who also portrayed him in the late 1970s. Characteristic of the many elaborate hoaxes and practical jokes Kaufman concocted, Clifton was not exclusively portrayed by Kaufman. Others, mainly longtime Kaufman friend [[Bob Zmuda]], also performed the role.

==Origin==
Kaufman would sometimes claim that Tony Clifton was a real lounge singer whom Kaufman encountered in the International Hotel in Las Vegas in 1969. He was waiting for [[Elvis Presley]] to arrive so he could meet him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Zehme|first=Bill|title=Lost In The Funhouse: The Life And Mind Of Andy Kaufman|year=1999|publisher=4th Estate|location=London|pages=108}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Kaufman may have seen Clifton as the antithesis of the sweet, gentle "Foreign Man" character he was best known for (which was later adapted into [[Latka Gravas]], Kaufman's character on ''[[Taxi (TV series)|Taxi]]'').

Clifton would often attempt to improvise comical lyrics that were [[anti-humor|intentionally unfunny]] before giving up entirely without seeming to care. Clifton also tended to randomly insult patrons, passing off the abuse as the "comedy" portion of his act. Adding to Clifton's annoying and unappealing presence was his tendency to rhyme various words at random in the middle of conversations. Many people misunderstood Kaufman's intent, focusing on the character's foul language and [[prima donna]] antics while failing to appreciate the fact that Clifton was meant to be the comic antithesis of the typical lounge singer: a bland, genial entertainer designed to add a touch of class to a hotel and make guests feel welcome.

For a brief time, it was unclear to some that Clifton was not a real person. News programs interviewed Clifton as Kaufman's opening act, but the interviews invariably would turn ugly whenever Kaufman's name came up. Clifton claimed Kaufman was using his name "to go places." Actually, in many cases, Andy Kaufman played Clifton. Promoters who thought they had caught on to the joke would hire Clifton because he was cheaper than booking Kaufman. However, Kaufman had the last laugh, enlisting his brother Michael or his showbiz partner [[Bob Zmuda]] to play the role, with Kaufman making unannounced appearances onstage during Clifton's act. 

[[Rodney Dangerfield]] was a big fan of Andy Kaufman, and hired Clifton to open for him for two shows at [[Bill Graham (promoter)|Bill Graham]]'s famed [[Fillmore West]]. After a disastrous first show, where Clifton took the stage with [[Tony Bennett]]'s famous "[[I Left My Heart in San Francisco]]" and was summarily booed, he reappeared on the second night in [[riot gear]] amid a shower of rotten vegetables and other detritus. 

Tony Clifton still makes occasional appearances, most notably in the days leading up to May 16, 2004, the twentieth anniversary of Kaufman's death. It was announced on May 16, 2008 that [[Comic Relief]], in recognition of the 24th anniversary of Andy Kaufman's departure, would present "The Return of Tony Clifton", with his Katrina Kiss My Ass Orchestra. The national tour kicked off June 27, 2008 at the [[Georgia Theatre]] in [[Athens, Georgia]], and benefited Gulf Coast musicians, dancers, and singers affected by [[Hurricane Katrina]]. Clifton fronted the Katrina Orchestra along with the Cliftonettes. Later dates included August 15 at Chicago's [[Chopin Theatre]].&lt;ref name="AVClub"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.avclub.com/content/blog/tony_clifton_is_alive_and_well_and|title=Tony Clifton is Alive and Well and Kicking Ass in Chicago|last=Rabin|first=Nathan|date=2008-08-18|work=[[The A.V. Club]]|publisher=Onion|accessdate=2008-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, Tony and his orchestra were featured headliners as part of the annual Hangout Music Festival in Gulf Shores, Alabama, on May 21.&lt;ref name="Hangout Music Festival 2011"&gt;{{cite news|title=Tony Clifton|website=Hangout Music Festival|url=http://hangoutmusicfest.com/tony-clifton/|accessdate=2011-04-19|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110427162239/http://hangoutmusicfest.com/tony-clifton/|archivedate=April 27, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later that month he began hosting the ''Tony Clifton Revue'' at [[The Comedy Store]] in Los Angeles. He was interviewed on the 284th (May 31, 2012) episode of [[Marc Maron]]'s ''[[WTF with Marc Maron|WTF podcast]]'' as promotion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite podcast|url=http://www.wtfpod.com/podcast/episodes/episode_284_-_craig_finn_tony_clifton |title= Episode 284 - Craig Finn / Tony Clifton |publisher=WTF |host=[[Marc Maron]] |date=May 31, 2012 |time=6:30 |accessdate=May 31, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Television==

===''Taxi''===
Clifton was hired to appear on an early episode of [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]'s ''[[Taxi (TV series)|Taxi]]''.  In 1977, the producers of ''Taxi'' saw Kaufman's Foreign Man act at [[The Comedy Store]], and offered him a role in their show based on the character.&lt;ref name=oral&gt;[http://www.bluedonut.com/ak.htm "Andy Kaufman Oral History"], interviews with Don Steinberg, ''[[GQ Magazine]]'', December 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; Kaufman wasn't a fan of sitcoms, but his manager, [[George Shapiro]], convinced him that this would propel him to stardom, where he would make a lot of money which he could then put into his own act, which became ''Andy's Funhouse''.&lt;ref name="oral"/&gt; Kaufman agreed to appear as [[Latka Gravas]] in fourteen episodes per season, approximately half of the entire series, if Tony Clifton was also allowed to guest star in the series.  The producers were well aware that "Clifton" was an alter ego of Kaufman, but went along with the fiction that Clifton was a separate actor.  They signed Clifton to a separate contract, and announced to the cast that Clifton was being hired to portray the character of Louie's brother&lt;ref name=DeVito/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZWDB5rUWEg Tony Danza Discusses Andy Kaufman]&lt;/ref&gt; in the series 13th episode.  

However, after the first day of rehearsal, the producers felt Kaufman-as-Clifton was not up to the acting challenge of playing the offered role.  Informed of this, Kaufman asked that "Clifton" be fired in public, ostensibly for coming to rehearsal late.&lt;ref name=DeVito&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wDL8Q_nqSY Danny DeVito Archive of American Television Interview]&lt;/ref&gt;  Clifton then showed up on set for the next day of filming, and was demanding, boorish and obnoxious.  The producers not only fired Clifton in front of press and network executives (who had gathered on set to witness the promised spectacle), but threw him off the set after he caused havoc and enraged series stars [[Judd Hirsch]] and [[Jeff Conaway]].  The role was hurriedly recast, and when Kaufman (as himself) returned to work for the following episode, he acted as if nothing had happened. 

[[Sam Simon]], a season 5 writer and [[showrunner]] for ''Taxi'', revealed in a 2013 interview with Marc Maron for the [[WTF_with_Marc_Maron|WTF Podcast]] that the story of Andy (as opposed to "Tony Clifton") having been generally disruptive on the show was "a complete fiction" largely created by Bob Zmuda. Simon maintained that Zmuda has a "vested interest" in promoting an out-of-control image of Kaufman. In the interview Simon stated that Kaufman was "completely professional" and that he "told you Tony Clifton was him", but he also conceded that Kaufman would have "loved" Zmuda's version of events.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wtfpod.com/podcast/episodes/episode_389_-_sam_simon WTF Podcast: Sam Simon interview]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2lNgzZP4SQA podcast recording, accessed 5/18/2014, pertinent portion at the 47:21 mark&lt;/ref&gt;  However, while many ''Taxi'' staffers have corroborated the story that Clifton was a disruptive presence during his brief time on set, Simon himself had no association with ''Taxi'' during its first season when Clifton made his appearance, and was not a witness to this specific event.  Simon did not join ''Taxi'' until two years later, during the series' third season.

===Other appearances===
Clifton (played by Zmuda) appeared once on ''[[Late Night with David Letterman]]'', where he was interviewed and sang a medley with the band. In 1982, Clifton also appeared on ''[[The Fantastic Miss Piggy Show]]'' as the host's "new discovery," although the other [[Muppets]] and host [[George Hamilton (actor)|George Hamilton]] remained skeptical of Clifton's talent. 

Perhaps the biggest myth surrounding Tony Clifton's TV appearances comes from [[Dinah Shore]]'s daytime talk show ''[[Dinah!|Dinah &amp; Friends]]''. According to legend Clifton arrived for the taping "drunk" and then pressured Shore in front of the studio audience to sing a duet with him although he had been previously told that she had a sore throat. In reality it was a pre-arranged bit, which featured messages from the producers telling the viewers at home that this was a "put on".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0wRoyA8qj94 Tony Clifton aka Andy Kaufman on The Dinah Shore Show]&lt;/ref&gt; The myth continues that after dumping eggs on Shore's head that the show's producers quickly cut to a commercial as Clifton was escorted out of the studio, and the tape of the incident was "destroyed". In reality the footage has been lost and, as with all Kaufman's appearances, the entire event was staged. 

Tony was also a heckler on Paul Provenzas’ “Green Room” and was escorted out of the room. 

In 2009, Clifton appeared on ''[[Opie and Anthony|The Opie &amp; Anthony Show]]'' to promote a performance at [[Santos Party House]] in New York City.&lt;ref name="Opie"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfn179KFr1Y|title=Opie &amp; Anthony: Tony Clifton In-Studio|accessdate=2014-12-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In other media==
===Films===
{{refimprove|section|date=April 2018}}

====Tony Clifton biopic====
Kaufman and Zmuda wrote a screenplay for a Tony Clifton [[biography]]. However, the plan was sidelined after the box office failure of Kaufman's first major motion picture ''[[Heartbeeps]]'', in which he co-starred with [[Bernadette Peters]] as a robot who falls in love. In the screenplay Clifton dies at [[Cedars-Sinai Medical Center]] in Los Angeles from cancer. Five years later, Kaufman died at the same hospital from lung cancer.

====''Man on the Moon''====
Clifton is portrayed in the Kaufman biographical film ''[[Man on the Moon (film)|Man on the Moon]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last=Travers | first=Peter | title=Travers on Milos Forman's Warmth and Mischief | website=Rolling Stone | date=April 14, 2018 | url=https://www.rollingstone.com/movies/news/travers-on-milos-formans-warmth-and-mischief-w519139 | access-date=April 23, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; credited as "Himself".

==Influence==
Kaufman's Tony Clifton character has influenced other "[[anti-humor|anti-comedy]]" acts, notably stand-up comedian [[Neil Hamburger]] and singer/comedian [[Unknown Hinson]]. [[Maren Ade|Maren Ade's]] Toni Erdmann, the protagonist in the 2016 Oscar-nominated [[Toni Erdmann|German movie of the same title]], was influenced by Kaufman concerning appearance, humor and first name.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://collider.com/toni-erdmann-maren-ade-interview/|title=‘Toni Erdmann': Maren Ade Talks Andy Kaufman and ‘My Father the Hero’ Parallels |first=Formo |last=Brian |publisher=Collider.com |date=December 26, 2016 |accessdate=October 22, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Uptown... It's Hot!''''' was a 1986 [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] play created, directed, choreographed by and starring [[Maurice Hines]]. Performed at the [[Lunt-Fontanne Theatre]], the play was a musical anthology chronicling the history of [[African-American music]] in the United States.

Although the music garnered praise, the play received generally unfavorable reviews.&lt;ref name=Rich/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Dazzling Dancing Can't Keep 'Uptown' on its Toes|author=[[Michael Kuchwara]]|publisher=The Associated Press|date=January 31, 1986}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=It Takes More Than a Few Songs to Make a Musical|publisher=''The New York Times''|author=Mel Gussow|url=http://theater2.nytimes.com/mem/theater/treview.html?res=9A0DE4DA153EF931A35751C0A960948260|date=February 2, 1986}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''New York Times'' critic [[Frank Rich]] called it "the theatrical equivalent of a telephone-booth-stuffing contest" and "an orgy of grotesque and sometimes necrophiliac mimicry."&lt;ref name=Rich&gt;{{cite news|title='Uptown' a musical|author=Frank Rich|publisher=''The New York Times''|date=January 29, 1986|url=http://theater2.nytimes.com/mem/theater/treview.html?res=9A0DEEDC1630F93AA15752C0A960948260}}&lt;/ref&gt; The play did, however, earn Hines a [[Tony Award]] nomination for Best Performance by a Leading Actor in a Musical.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1083/is_/ai_n26857910|publisher=''Dance Magazine''|title=Maurice Hines melds hip hop, jazz, Latin and even a little tap in his Broadway directorial debut|date=May 2006|author=Sylviane Gold}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''video tape recorder''' ('''VTR''') is a [[tape recorder]] designed to record and playback [[video]] and [[audio signal|audio]] material on [[magnetic tape]]. The early VTRs are [[reel-to-reel|open-reel]] devices which record on individual reels of 2-inch-wide (5.08 cm) tape. They were used in television studios, serving as a replacement for [[motion picture film]] stock and making recording for television applications cheaper and quicker. Beginning in 1963, videotape machines made [[instant replay]] during televised sporting events possible. Improved formats, in which the tape was contained inside a [[videocassette]], were introduced around 1969; the machines which play them are called [[videocassette recorder]]s. Agreement by Japanese manufacturers on a common standard recording format, so cassettes recorded on one manufacturer's machine would play on another's, made a consumer market possible, and the first consumer videocassette recorder was introduced by Sony in 1971.

== History ==
In early 1951 Bing Crosby asked his Chief Engineer John T. (Jack) Mullin if television could be recorded on tape as was the case for audio.  Mullin said that he thought that it could be done.  Bing asked Ampex to build one and also set up a laboratory for Mullin in Bing Crosby Enterprises (BCE) to build one.&lt;ref name="IEEE"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ethw.org/First-Hand:Bing_Crosby_and_the_Recording_Revolution|title=Bing Crosby and the Recording Revolution}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1951 it was believed that if the tape was run at a very high speed it could provide the necessary [[bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]] to record the video signal.  The problem was that a video signal has a much wider bandwidth than an audio signal does (6&amp;nbsp;MHz vs 20&amp;nbsp;kHz), requiring extremely high tape speeds to record it.  However, there was another problem.  The magnetic head design would not permit bandwidths over 1 meghertz to be recorded regardless of the tape speed.

The first efforts at video recording, using recorders similar to audio recorders with fixed heads, were unsuccessful.  The first such demonstration of this technique was done by BCE on 11 November 1951.  The result was a very poor picture.  Another of the early efforts was the [[Vision Electronic Recording Apparatus]], a high-speed multi-track machine developed by the [[BBC]] in 1952.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/h2g2/A3224936|title=The History of Magnetic Recording|publisher=BBC 20 December 2004|accessdate=15 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; This machine used a thin steel tape on a 21-inch (53.5&amp;nbsp;cm) reel traveling at over 200 inches (510&amp;nbsp;cm) per second. Despite 10 years of research and improvements, it was never widely used due to the immense length of tape required for each minute of recorded video. 

By 1952 BCE also had moved on to multi-track machine, but found limitations in recording bandwidth even at the high speeds.  In 1953 BCE discovered that the magnetic head design was the problem.  This problem was corrected and bandwidths exceeding the 1 megahertz limit were able to be recorded.&lt;ref name="IEEE" /&gt;  Since BCE and AMPEX were working together on the video recorder the new head designed was shared with them, and AMPEX used it in their recorder.  In 1955 BCE demonstrated a broadcast quality color recorder that operated at 100 inches per second and CBS ordered three of them.   Many other fixed-head recording systems were tried but all required an impractically high tape speed. It became clear that practical video recording technology depended on finding some way of recording the wide-bandwidth video signal without the high tape speed required by linear-scan machines.

In 1953 Dr. Norikazu Sawazaki developed a prototype [[helical scan]] video tape recorder.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=PL0eAQAAMAAJ|title=SMPTE Journal: Publication of the Society of Motion Picture and Television Engineers|first=Society of Motion Picture and Television|last=Engineers|date=4 June 1987|publisher=The Society|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another solution was transverse-scan technology, developed by [[Ampex]] around 1954, in which the recording heads are mounted on a spinning drum and record tracks in the transverse direction, across the tape. By recording on the full width of the tape rather than just a narrow track down the center, this technique achieved a much higher density of data per linear centimeter of tape, allowing a lower tape speed of 15 inches per second to be used. The Ampex VRX-1000 became the world's first commercially successful videotape recorder in 1956. It uses the [[quadruplex videotape|2" quadruplex]] format, using two-inch (5.1&amp;nbsp;cm) tape.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cedmagic.com/history/ampex-commercial-vtr-1956.html |title=Ampex VRX-1000 - The first commercial videotape recorder in 1956 |publisher=Cedmagic.com |date=1956-04-14 |accessdate=2010-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of its {{US$|50,000}} price, the Ampex VRX-1000 could be afforded only by the television networks and the largest individual stations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Richard N. Diehl |url=http://www.labguysworld.com/VTR_BirthOf.htm |title=Labguy'S World: The Birth Of Video Recording |publisher=Labguysworld.com |date= |accessdate=2010-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ampex's [[quadruplex videotape|quadruplex]] magnetic tape video recording system has certain limitations, such as the lack of clean pause, or still-frame, capability, because when tape motion is stopped, only a single segment of the picture recording is present at the playback heads (only 16 lines of the picture in each segment), so it can only reproduce recognizable pictures when the tape is playing at normal speed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://winkhackman.com/blog/gone-quite-forgotten/ Wink Hackman; Expert training for Sony MVS users worldwide] Retrieved Christmas, December 25, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;) But in spite of its drawbacks it remained the broadcasting studio standard until about 1980. The [[helical scan]] system overcame this limitation.

In 1959 [[Toshiba]] released the first commercial helical-scan video tape recorder.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://toshiba-mirai-kagakukan.jp/en/learn/history/ichigoki/1959vtr/index.htm|title=Toshiba Science Museum : World's First Helical Scan Video Tape Recorder|author=|date=|website=toshiba-mirai-kagakukan.jp}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1963, [[Philips]] introduced its EL3400 1" helical scan recorder (aimed at the business and domestic user), and [[Sony]] marketed the 2" PV-100, its first [[reel-to-reel|open-reel]] [[VTR]] intended for business, medical, airline, and educational use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sony.net/Fun/SH/1-11/h1.html |title=Sony Global - Sony History |publisher=Sony.net |date= |accessdate=2010-05-31 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090907081817/http://sony.net/Fun/SH/1-11/h1.html |archivedate=September 7, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Telcan, produced by the Nottingham Electronic Valve Company and demonstrated on [[June 1963|June 24, 1963]],&lt;ref&gt;Albert Abramson, ''The History of Television, 1942 to 2000'' (McFarland, 2003) p99&lt;/ref&gt; was the first home video recorder. It could be bought as a unit or in kit form for £60. However, there were several drawbacks: it was expensive, not easy to put together, and can record for only 20 minutes at a time in black-and-white.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.terramedia.co.uk/media/video/telcan.htm |title=The quest for home video: Telcan home video recorder |publisher=Terramedia.co.uk |date=2001-10-22 |accessdate=2010-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.totalrewind.org/revolution/R_telwes.htm |title=Total Rewind |publisher=Total Rewind |date= |accessdate=2010-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/ahistoryoftheworld/objects/aNhfBgCgSByEMns5XPxXqA |title=BBC History |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date=1963-06-24 |accessdate=2010-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Sony model [[CV-2000]], first marketed in 1965, is their first VTR intended for home use and is based on half-inch tape.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smecc.org/sony_cv_series_video.htm |title=Sony CV Series Video |publisher=Smecc.org |date= |accessdate=2010-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ampex and [[RCA]] followed in 1965 with their own open-reel [[monochrome]] VTRs priced under [[United States dollar|US]] $1,000 for the home consumer market. Prerecorded videos for home replay became available in 1967.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.broadcastingcable.com/news/news-articles/timeline-fun-facts/112619|title=Timeline &amp;amp; Fun Facts|author=|date=|website=broadcastingcable.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[EIAJ-1|EIAJ]] format is a standard half-inch format used by various manufacturers. EIAJ-1 is an open-reel format. EIAJ-2 uses a cartridge that contains a supply reel, but not the take-up reel. Since the take-up reel is part of the recorder, the tape has to be fully rewound before removing the cartridge, which is a relatively slow procedure.

The development of the videocassette followed other replacements of open-reel systems with a cassette or cartridge in consumer items: the [[Stereo-Pak]] 4-track audio cartridge in 1962, the [[compact audio cassette]] and [[Instamatic]] film cartridge in 1963, the [[Stereo 8|8-track cartridge]] in 1965, and the [[Super 8 mm film|Super 8]] home motion picture film cartridge in 1966.
Before the invention of the video tape recorder, live video was recorded onto motion picture [[film stock]] in a process known as [[telerecording]] or kinescoping. Although the first quadruplex VTRs record with good quality, the recordings cannot be slowed or [[freeze frame television|freeze-framed]], so kinescoping processes continued to be used for about a decade after the development of the first VTRs.

==Technology==
[[Image:Video tape scanning diagrams.png|thumb|upright=1.4|Scanning techniques used in video tape recorders. (A) Transverse scanning used in the early [[2-inch quadruplex videotape|quadriplex]] system requires several vertical tracks to record a video frame. (B) [[Helical scan]], by recording in long diagonal tracks, is able to fit a full video field onto each track. The first full-helical system uses one head, requiring tape to wrap fully around drum. (C) Half-helical system with 2 heads only requires tape to wrap 180° around the drum.]]   

In the technique used in all transverse-scan video tape recorders, the recording heads are mounted in a rapidly spinning drum which is pressed against the moving tape, so the heads move across the tape in a transverse or nearly vertical path, recording the video signal in consecutive parallel tracks sideways across the tape. This allows use of the entire width of the tape, storing much more data per inch of tape, compared to the fixed head used in audio tape recording, which records a single track down the tape. The heads move across the tape at the high speed necessary to record the high-bandwidth video signal, but the tape moves at a slower speed through the machine. In addition, three ordinary tracks are recorded along the edge of the tape by stationary recording heads. For correct playback, the motion of the heads has to be precisely synchronized with the motion of the tape through the capstan, so a control track of synchronizing pulses is recorded. The other two tracks are for the audio channel and a cuing track.

The early machines use the Ampex [[quadruplex videotape|2 inch quadruplex]] system in which the drum has 4 heads and rotates at 14,400 RPM perpendicular to the tape, so the recorded tracks are transverse to the tape axis. With 2-inch tape this requires 16 tracks for a single analog NTSC video frame, or 20 for a PAL frame. 

The helical scan methods use a recording drum with a diagonal axis of rotation. The tape is wrapped longitudinally around the drum by idler wheels, so the tape heads, instead of moving across the tape at almost 90° to the direction of motion as in the quadruplex system, move across the tape at a shallow angle, recording a long diagonal track across the tape. This allows an entire frame to be recorded per track. This simplifies the electronics and timing systems. It also allows the recorder to be paused (freeze-framed) during playback to display a single still frame, by simply stopping the tape transport mechanism, allowing the tape heads to repeatedly pass over the same track.      

This recording technique has many potential sources of timing errors. If the mechanism runs at an absolutely constant speed, and never varies from moment to moment, or from the time of recording to the time of playback, then the timing of the playback signal is exactly the same as the input.  However, imperfection being inevitable, the timing of the playback always differs to some extent from the original signal. Longitudinal error (error arising from effects in the long direction of the tape) can be caused by variations in the rotational rate of the [[capstan (tape recorder)|capstan]] drive, stretching of the tape medium, and jamming of tape in the machine. Transverse error (error arising from effects in the cross-tape direction) can be caused by variations in the rotational speed of the scanning drum and differences in the angle between the tape and the scanning heads (usually addressed by video [[video tape tracking|tracking]] controls). Longitudinal errors are similar to the ones that cause [[wow (recording)|wow]] and [[flutter (electronics and communication)|flutter]] in audio recordings. Since these errors are not so subtle and since it is standard video recording practice to record a parallel control track, these errors are detected and [[servos]] are adjusted accordingly to dramatically reduce this problem.

== VCR ==
{{Main|Videocassette recorder}}
Many of the deficiencies of the open-reel systems were overcome with the invention of the [[videocassette recorder]] (VCR), where the [[videotape]] is enclosed in a [[usability|user-friendly]] [[videocassette]] shell. This subsequently became the most familiar type of VTR known to consumers. In this system, the tape is preattached onto two reels enclosed within the cassette, and tape loading and unloading is automated. There is no need for the user to ever touch the tape, and the media can be protected from dust, dirt, and tape misalignments that can foul the recording mechanism. Typically, the only time the user ever touches the tape in a videocassette is when a failure results from a tape getting stuck in the mechanism.

Home VCRs first became available in the early 1970s, with [[Philips]] releasing the Model 1500 in England in 1972.&lt;ref name=vcr-tvhist&gt;{{cite web|title=VCR and Home Video History|url=http://www.tvhistory.tv/VCR%20History.htm|work=Television History - The First 75 Years|publisher=TVhistory.TV|accessdate=24 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first system to be notably successful with consumers was [[Sony]]'s [[Betamax]] (or Beta) in 1975. It was soon followed by the competing [[VHS]] (Video Home System) format from [[JVC]] in 1977 &lt;ref name=vcr-tvhist /&gt; and later by other formats such as [[Video 2000]] from [[Philips]], [[V-Cord]] from [[Sanyo]], and [[VX (videocassette format)|Great Time Machine]] from [[Quasar (brand)|Quasar]].

The Beta/VHS format war soon began, while the other competitors quickly disappeared. Betamax sales eventually began to dwindle, and after several years VHS emerged as the winner of the format war. In 1988, Sony began to market its own VHS machines, and despite claims that it was still backing Beta, it was clear that the format was no longer viable in most parts of the world. In parts of [[South America]] and in [[Japan]], Betamax continued to be popular and was still in production up to the end of 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://money.cnn.com/2015/11/10/technology/sony-betamax/index.html|title=Sony is finally killing its ancient Betamax format|last=Riley|first=Charles|date=2015-11-10|website=CNNMoney|access-date=2017-02-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later developments saw analog magnetic tapes largely replaced by [[digital video]] tape formats. Following this, much of the VTR market, in particular videocassettes and VCRs popular at the consumer level, were also replaced by non-tape media, such as [[DVD]] and later [[Blu-ray Disc|Blu-ray]] [[optical disc]]s.

'''''Virus: The Game''''' is a [[Strategy video game|strategy]]/[[Action game|action]] [[video game]] by [[Sir-Tech]]. The game levels take place in the user's [[hard drive]], with files and directories being represented by 3D rooms through which the player navigates.

==Summary==
The objective is to battle against '[[Computer virus|viruses]]' that invade the user's directory structure and files. The game and its advertisement included warnings reminding the player that "it's just a game," and that the game is not actually causing harm to the computer's files. The user's graphic files are used as the wall texture and sound files are used as the background music.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mobygames.com/game/windows/virus-the-game Game entry] at MobyGames&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIgpWGVvfjA&amp;list=PLi_KYBWS_E70Bd7HDhLz0a16FFrlCtOn4&amp;index=1] danooct1 Playing on Youtube&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
The critical reception was generally negative. [[GameSpot]] claimed that "Virus has all the appearances of a game that underwent numerous design changes but never really came together."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mobygames.com/game/windows/virus-the-game/mobyrank ''Virus: The Game''] at MobyGames&lt;/ref&gt;

==Advertisement==
A quasi-[[Viral marketing|viral]] advertisement campaign for the game was started—one of the first of its kind.{{citation needed|date=September 2012}} The advertisement, named Russ, was viewed in the form of a downloaded [[.exe]] file. When the file was run, a full screen representation of the desktop appeared. The software then began simulating deletion of the Windows folder.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGm8idw45as] Russ Advertisement test by danooct1&lt;/ref&gt; When this process was complete, a message was slowly typed on screen saying "Thank god this is only a game." A screen with the purchase information appeared on screen and then returned to the desktop. No damage was done to the computer during the advertisement. This advertisement was not well received, most likely due to the [[scareware]] tactic involved.

'''“What It Was, Was Football”''' is a [[monologue]] by actor-comedian [[Andy Griffith]]. The monologue is a description of a [[college football]] game, as seen by a naive country preacher who attends the game by accident and is entirely puzzled by it.

==Production==
At Griffith's request, Milton Alderfer (who was only 19 at the time), recorded and produced the original master tape in Greensboro, North Carolina.&lt;ref&gt;"Winning Game" ''The'' ''Greensboro'' ''Record'' 16 Dec. 1953 C6&lt;/ref&gt; The master was then sent to [[Chapel Hill, North Carolina]] and mass-produced by the [[Colonial Records]] label in late 1953. Soon, after Colonial had sold nearly 50,000 copies of the record, [[Capitol Records]] took over distribution and ultimately sold nearly 800,000 copies. It also shot into the Top 10 in the [[Billboard Magazine|Billboard]] record charts, peaking at #9 in February 1954. "What It Was..." (which remains one of the biggest-selling comedy records of all time) was instrumental in launching Griffith's career in [[television]], [[Theatre|stage]], and [[film]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lib.unc.edu/fol/andy_griffith.html|title=Friends of the Library – UNC Chapel Hill Libraries|website=www.lib.unc.edu|accessdate=7 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the original single, the monologue is credited to ''"Deacon'' Andy Griffith."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dmdb.org/cgi-bin/plinfo_view.pl?SYN053537|title=details for What It Was, Was Football - Deacon Andy Griffith|website=dmdb.org|accessdate=7 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Griffith made an appearance on ''[[The Ed Sullivan Show]]'' in 1954, in large part due to the popularity of the record.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.museum.tv/archives/etv/G/htmlG/griffithand/griffithand.htm|title=The Museum of Broadcast Communications - Encyclopedia of Television|website=www.museum.tv|accessdate=7 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"What It Was, Was Football" was printed in ''[[Mad (magazine)|Mad]]'' magazine in 1958, with illustrations by artist [[George Woodbridge]]. Most of the text of the recording is printed verbatim with faithful renderings of Griffith's accent as heard on the recording; however, Griffith's original climactic description of "the awfullest fight that I have ever seen...''in my life!"'' is moved to an earlier position in the printed version. Also, while the original recording makes no direct reference to a specific university as a setting for the game witnessed, the illustrations in the ''Mad'' version refer to both the [[Ivy League]] and [[University of Notre Dame]]. Due to licensing issues, this adaptation had to be omitted from the ''Totally MAD'' CD-ROM collection of the magazine's run.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.madcoversite.com/missing_was.html|title=Doug Gilford's Mad Cover Site - What It Was, Was Football! - from Mad Issue #40|website=www.madcoversite.com|accessdate=7 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1987, Andy Griffith made an appearance on ''[[The Tonight Show]]'' promoting his series, ''[[Matlock (TV series)|Matlock]],'' in which he acted out the attorney Benjamin Layton Matlock, one of whose heroes was, presumably, [[Erle Stanley Gardner]]'s [[Perry Mason]]. During the interview, guest host [[Bill Cosby]] told Griffith that he had purchased Griffith's recording of "What It Was, Was Football." Cosby then told Griffith that he had performed it at school and received an A for his grade, much to Griffith's surprise and delight.
  
In 1997, the monologue was made into a [[short film]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0380060/|title=What It Was Was Football|publisher=|accessdate=7 December 2017|via=www.imdb.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''World Mime Day''' is a worldwide initiative of the [[World Mime Organisation]] to celebrate the Art of Mime and [[non-verbal communication]] on March 22&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=World Mime Day|url=http://www.teatrdlawas.pl/aktualnosci/14341-dzis-swiatowy-dzien-pantomimy|website=Teatr Dla Vas|publisher=Teatr Dla Vas|accessdate=22 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; the day of birth of legendary french mime artist [[Marcel Marceau]]. It is being celebrated since 2011 in more and more countries each year on four continents. World Mime Day is not officially recognized by UNESCO.

== Initiators ==
* Marko Stojanović, a mime artist from Serbia and president of the [[World Mime Organisation]].
* Ofer Blum, a mime artist from Israel and vice-president of the World Mime Organisation.
* Jean Bernard Laclotte, a mime artist from France.

All three of them are former students of [[Marcel Marceau]].

== History ==
World Mime Day is one of those ideas that occur on different sides of the planet in almost the same time and it should belong to all humanity. The three initiators are probably not the only people that thought of establishing the World Mime Day under this or any other name/title.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=World Mime Day|url=http://www.worldmime.org/index.php/en/about-wmo/short-history|website=World Mime Organisation|publisher=World Mime Organisation|accessdate=22 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Short History of WMD|url=http://www.uniarts.se/storage/ma/8a14ed25a3a54dcba7efb42d6198331e/91b114422cdf4a18b26560851eace83a/doc/2CA96AF0B9C4E31C2BA67486ABFB4D140CC8AC83/About%20WMO.doc|website=Stockholm University of the Arts|publisher=Stockholm University of the Arts|accessdate=25 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1998 [[Israel]]i [[mime artist]] Ofer Blum came to Serbia, at that time still called Yugoslavia for a short tour organised by Marko Stojanovic, his friend and classmate from Marcel Marceau International Mime School in [[Paris]]. It is than that Blum and Stojanovic first spoke about establishing a [[World Mime Organisation]], not yet under that name and a World Mime Day or as they called it at that time "International Day of Mime".
Marcel Marceau was still alive, so was his school but unfortunately Blum and Stojanovic were not aware of the seriousness of their ideas and they were also preoccupied with their careers.
It was only in 2004 that World Mime Organisation was officially registered as a Non-Governmental and Non-Profit organisation in Serbia, where the paperwork was the easiest and the World Mime Day idea was back "on the table" (where it stayed till 2011).
In 2007, Marceau died and again Blum and Stojanovic came back to the idea of establishing the '''World Mime Day''' to celebrate the day when Marceau was born - [[March 22]].

In April 2011 Jean Bernard Laclotte has sent an e-mail to Stojanovic with the same idea and a developed concept of the "Journée Mondiale du Mime" except that he wanted to mark the day when Marceau died 22 September.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Journée Mondiale du Mime|url=https://sites.google.com/site/journeemondialedumime/home|website=Journée Mondiale du Mime|publisher=Journée Mondiale du Mime|accessdate=22 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thanks to Laclotte’s initiative "Journée Mondiale du Mime" was celebrated in several countries around the world on September 22, 2011. World Mime Day is celebrated on March 22 in most of the countries but there are still few countries, especially in [[South America]] celebrating it on 22 September.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Hoy se celebra el Dia Internacional del Mimo|url=http://www.elimpulso.com/noticias/actualidad/entretenimiento/hoy-se-celebra-el-dia-internacional-del-mimo|agency=El Impulso|publisher=El Impulso|date=22 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

World Mime Organisation recognises "Journée Mondiale du Mime 2011" as the first World Mime Day celebrated.
