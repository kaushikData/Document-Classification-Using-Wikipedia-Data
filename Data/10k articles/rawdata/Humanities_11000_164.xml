      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2796">'''Added Art''' uses an existing piece of artwork for its canvas, just as traditional [[graffiti]] uses the wall of a building for the canvas. It is essentially the graffiti of artwork. Added Art is a merging of high and low art, using the concepts of graffiti, in a high art environment.  Adding to someone else’s work has been a very common occurrence in graffiti for decades. In the urban environment, it is typically considered aggressive or antagonistic in nature,&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20090412152743/http://www.myartspace.com/blog/2009/04/street-art-defacement-appropriate-media.html ]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.myballard.com/2009/07/06/vandals-deface-bergen-place-mural/|title=» Vandals deface Bergen Place mural|date=6 July 2009|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; but also form of competition. However, it is still considered a taboo in the more established high arts, even though it has been practiced for over fifty years by stalwarts such as [[Rauschenberg]] in his ''[[Erased de Kooning Drawing]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://time4time.blogspot.com//2007/06/robert-raushenberg-erased-de-kooning.html|title=time4time|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In more recent examples, [[Banksy]] has done several added art pieces over [[Damien Hirst]]'s "spot" painting,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.artofthestate.co.uk/banksy/banksy-versus-bristol-museum-044-hirst-roller-rat.htm|title=Banksy – Hirst spot painting with roller rat|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.flickr.com/photos/edcotton/2266287615/|title=Banksy/Hirst Collaboration- $1.8 million|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Mat Benote]] used an untitled work by [[Robert Morris (artist)|Robert Morris]] at the MoMA in NYC as a canvas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.juxtapoz.com/Current/controversial-graffiti-artist-mat-benote-strikes-the-guggenheim|title=Juxtapoz Magazine – Juxtapoz Magazine|publisher=|access-date=2009-08-25|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090807093332/http://www.juxtapoz.com/Current/controversial-graffiti-artist-mat-benote-strikes-the-guggenheim|archive-date=2009-08-07|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A very interesting example was done by the [[Chapman Brothers]], who painted over sketches originally created by Adolf Hitler.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/art/news/the-art-of-adolf-hitler-with-a-little-help-from-the-chapman-brothers-836755.html |title=News &amp;#124; UK and Worldwide News &amp;#124; Newspaper |publisher=The Independent |date= |accessdate=2016-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1984">'''Ahsikent''' (recorded as '''Akhsikath''' in [[medieval]] texts) is a site of ancient settlement and ancient capital of Farghona ([[Fergana]]). It is located on the right branch of the [[Syr Darya|Sirdarya River]] in the To‘raqorghon district of the [[Namangan]] region of [[Uzbekistan]] ({{coord|40.886569|71.450602|scale:5000|format=dms|display=inline,title}}). It is currently under consideration for designation as a [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]].

== Site Description ==

Ahsikent occupies an area of more than 25 hectares. The city was founded between the 3rd - 2nd centuries B.C., and functioned up to 1219 A.D. It has been completely destroyed by Mongolian forces. The city structure consisted of the citadel, Shakhristan - the city itself and the ''rabad'' (suburb) of the city. All three parts of the city have been enclosed by the fortification. The palace of governors and zindan (prison) were situated in the arc. There was a city market, cathedral mosque, and a khouz, erected from baked brick in Shahristan.  The craftsmen's area was located in the ''rabad''.  Metallurgical production in Ahsiket was known far beyond [[Central Asia]]. It was the only place in Central Asia where very high-quality steel - known as Damascus or Damask steel - has been produced. At Ahsikent there was discovered a bath constructed in the 2nd century A.D.  After the Mongolian invasion, new Ahsikent arose 5–6&amp;nbsp;km to the west of the ancient city. According to historical data, the known poet and historian - [[Babur]], grandson of [[Timur|Amir Temur]], was born here.&lt;ref&gt;http://whc.unesco.org/en/tentativelists/5293/&lt;/ref&gt;

== World Heritage Status ==
This site was added to the UNESCO World Heritage Tentative List on 18/01/08, in the Cultural category.

[[Image:Vasnetsov Razvlechenie.jpg|300px|thumb|''Amusement'', by [[Viktor Vasnetsov]]]]

'''Amusement''', from the old French ''à muser'' – to put into a stupid stare,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/6786#eid4700112|title=Amuse, v.|last=|first=|date=|website=Oxford English Dictionary|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=21 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; is the state of [[experience|experiencing]] [[humour|humorous]] and [[entertainment|entertaining]] events or situations while the person or animal actively maintains the experience, and is associated with [[enjoyment]], [[happiness]], [[laughter]] and [[pleasure]]. It is an emotion with positive valence and high physiological arousal.

Amusement is considered an "epistemological" emotion because humor occurs when one experiences a cognitive shift from one knowledge structure about a target to another, such as hearing the punchline of a joke.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Shiota, M. N., Keltner, D., &amp; John, O. P.|title=Positive emotion dispositions differentially associated with Big Five personality and attachment style.|journal=The Journal of Positive Psychology|date=2006|volume=1|issue=2|pages=61–71|doi=10.1080/17439760500510833|citeseerx=10.1.1.421.1730}}&lt;/ref&gt; The pleasant surprise that happens from learning this new information leads to a state of amusement which people often express through smiling, laughter or chuckling.

Current studies have not yet reached consensus on the exact purpose of amusement, though theories have been advanced in the fields of psychology, psychiatry and sociology.  In addition, the precise mechanism that causes a given element (image, sound, behavior, etc.) to be perceived as more or less 'amusing' than another, similar element to a particular individual is not clearly understood.

==Theories==

Two different theoretical perspectives about emotion provide contrasting origins of amusement:

=== Evolutionary ===
The evolutionary perspective proposes that amusement is a distinct emotion that evolved to enhance a species’ survival. Collective laughter helps define an ingroup, helping people recognize those similar to them and feel included.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Shiota, M. N., Campos, B., Keltner, D., &amp; Hertenstein, M. J.|title=Positive emotion and the regulation of interpersonal relationships in The Regulation of Emotion|date=2004|publisher=Philippot, P. &amp; Feldman, R. S. Eds. Lawrence Erlbaum Associates Inc.|location=Mahwah, NJ|pages=127–155}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Latta, R. L.|title=The basic humor process: A cognitive-shift theory and the case against incongruity.|date=1999|publisher=Mouton de Gruyter|location=New York, NY}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also helps identify outgroup members and enhance the barrier between the two. Laughter can provide network support as encouragement, or it can inform ingroup members that they are losing majority favor and to adjust their behavior to reassimilate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Coser|first1=Rose Laub|title=Some Social Functions of Laughter|journal=Human Relations|date=1 April 2016|volume=12|issue=2|pages=171–182|doi=10.1177/001872675901200205}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Constructed emotion ===
The [[theory of constructed emotion]] suggests that when humans have a positive experience that increases their arousal, such as a faster heartbeat and increased sweat production, they cognitively seek out a label for that feeling. They will land on amusement if that experience resembles other amusement experiences they have had.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Barrett, L. F.|title=Solving the emotion paradox: Categorization and the experience of emotion|journal=Personality and Social Psychology Review|date=2006|volume=10|issue=1|pages=20–46|doi=10.1207/s15327957pspr1001_2|pmid=16430327|citeseerx=10.1.1.577.4057}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Barrett, L. F.|title=The theory of constructed emotion: an active inference account of interoception and categorization|journal=Social Cognitive and Affective Neuroscience|volume=12|issue=1|pages=1–23|pmid=27798257|pmc=5390700|year=2017|doi=10.1093/scan/nsw154}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Emotional expression of amusement ==
The origin of the study of emotional expression is often attributed to [[Charles Darwin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Keltner, D., Tracy, J. L., Sauter, D. A., Cordaro, D. C. &amp; McNeil, G.|title=Expression of Emotion.| journal=In Barrett, L. F., Lewis, M. &amp; Haviland-Jones, J. M. Eds., Handbook of Emotions|date=2016|volume=4th|pages=467–482}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1872, Darwin published his book ''[[The Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals]]'', in which he extensively describes his observations of how people and animals display emotions on their faces and through sound.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Darwin|first1=Charles|title=The Expressions of the Emotions in Man and Animals|orig-year=1872|year=1998|publisher=Harper Collins|location=London|edition=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Darwin comments on amusement as an emotion of great joy during which a person is likely to laugh. He also notes that across all peoples humans can laugh until they are panting and tears roll down their cheeks. In the 1960s, [[Paul Ekman]], an American psychologist, revived the study of emotional expression, proposing, like Darwin, that emotions were universally recognizable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ekman|first1=Paul|title=The argument and evidence about universals in facial expressions|journal=Handbook of Social Psychophysiology|date=1989|pages=143–164}}&lt;/ref&gt; His early work focused on six basic emotions: [[happiness]], [[anger]], [[sadness]], [[fear]], [[disgust]] and [[surprise (emotion)|surprise]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ekman, P., Sorenson, E. R., &amp; Friesen, W. V.|title=Pan-cultural elements in facial displays of emotion|journal=Science|date=1969|volume=164|issue=3875|pages=86–88|doi=10.1126/science.164.3875.86}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the 1990s, Ekman had expanded this list to include several additional emotions, one of which was amusement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ekman, P., &amp; Rosenberg, E. L. (Eds.).|title=What the face reveals: Basic and applied studies of spontaneous expression using the Facial Action Coding System (FACS)|date=1997|publisher=Oxford University Press, USA.}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Displays of amusement have been distinguished from related emotions like embarrassment and shame.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Keltner|first1=Dacher|title=Signs of appeasement: Evidence for the distinct displays of embarrassment, amusement, and shame|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|date=1995|volume=68|issue=3|pages=441–454|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.68.3.441|citeseerx=10.1.1.420.9278}}&lt;/ref&gt; More recent studies have confirmed that laughter is a distinct signal of amusement and is recognizable across cultures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Simon-Thomas, E. R., Keltner, D. J., Sauter, D., Sinicropi-Yao, L., &amp; Abramson, A.|title=The voice conveys specific emotions: evidence from vocal burst displays|journal=Emotion|date=2009|volume=9 |issue=6|pages=838–846|doi=10.1037/a0017810|pmid=20001126|citeseerx=10.1.1.421.2565}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Laukka, P., Elfenbein, H.

[[File:Ron Killings &amp; Vince McMahon laughing.jpg|thumb|Professional wrestlers [[Vince McMahon]] (right) and [[Ron Killings]] (left) showing amused facial expressions]]

=== Facial expression ===
An amused facial expression typically has these characteristics:&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|title=Emotional Intelligence Quiz|url=https://greatergood.berkeley.edu/quizzes/take_quiz/ei_quiz|website=Greater Good Science Center|accessdate=23 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Head: Thrown back with jaw lifted
*Eyes: Crow's feet at the eyes indicating that the muscles have tightened
*Mouth: Open, jaw dropped with relaxed muscles

=== Vocal burst ===
The expression of amusement is usually accompanied by genuine laughter. The experience of laughter changes the breathing pattern and often causes all the muscles to relax.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Cultural considerations ==

As a positive, high arousal emotion, amusement falls in the same category as excitement and exhilaration. These emotions are highly valued in American culture where positive feelings that high in energy are seen as ideal. In contrast, East Asian cultures value positive, low arousal emotions such as contentment, calm and peacefulness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tsai|first1=Jeanne L.|title=Ideal affect: Cultural causes and behavioral consequences.|journal=Perspectives on Psychological Science|date=2007|volume=2|issue=3|pages=242–259|doi=10.1111/j.1745-6916.2007.00043.x|pmid=26151968}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Clinical uses==
=== Emotion regulation ===

Emotion regulation is the term for how people attempt to influence - increasing, decreasing, maintaining or changing - how, when, and where they experience emotion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gross|first1=James J.|title=The emerging field of emotion regulation: An integrative review|journal=Review of General Psychology|date=1998|volume=2|issue=3|pages=271–299|doi=10.1037/1089-2680.2.3.271|citeseerx=10.1.1.476.7042}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through changing how they think about a target of amusement, like a humorous video clip, people are able to increase and decrease how much amusement they feel, express in smiles and laughs, and experience in their bodies (e.g. increased heart rate and respiration).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Giuliani, N. R., McRae, K., &amp; Gross, J. J.|title=The up-and down-regulation of amusement: experiential, behavioral, and autonomic consequences|journal=Emotion|date=2008|volume=8|issue=5|pages=714–719|doi=10.1037/a0013236|pmid=18837622|pmc=4138973}}&lt;/ref&gt; Choosing to increase or prolong experiences of positive emotion is one way in which people can learn to cope when faced with challenges and develop resilience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tugade, M. M., &amp; Fredrickson, B. L.|title=Regulation of positive emotions: Emotion regulation strategies that promote resilience|journal=Journal of Happiness Studies|date=2007|volume=8|issue=3|pages=311–333|doi=10.1007/s10902-006-9015-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Resilience ===

As a positive emotion, amusement contributes to the development of resilience in both children&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bai, S., &amp; Repetti, R. L.|title=Short‐term resilience processes in the family.|journal=Family Relations|date=2015|volume=64|issue=1|pages=108–119|doi=10.1111/fare.12101|pmid=26246651|pmc=4523303}}&lt;/ref&gt; and adults.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Fredrickson, B.

[[File:Laughter Yoga.jpg|thumb|People engaging in laughter therapy]]

=== Laughter therapy ===

Rapidly growing in popularity, [[laughter]] therapy, or humor therapy, focuses on promoting laughter as a therapeutic tool.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Burbank|first1=Luke|title=The Growing Popularity of Laughter Therapy|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5165226|website=NPR.org|accessdate=24 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Usually implemented in a group, laughter therapy uses a variety of gag jokes like red noses and magic tricks to encourage laughter - fake or real. Laughter causes the bodies' muscles to relax which increases blood flow and oxygen intake.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Laughter Therapy|url=https://www.cancercenter.com/treatments/laughter-therapy/|website=Cancer Treatment Centers of America|accessdate=24 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Proposed benefits include: Stress management,&lt;ref name="MayoClinicLaughter"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Mayo Clinic Staff|title=Stress relief from laughter? It's no joke|url=https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/stress-management/in-depth/stress-relief/art-20044456|website=www.mayoclinic.org|publisher=Mayo Clinic|accessdate=5 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; relaxation, improved mental functions, improved digestion and pain relief. Some suggest that laughter activates similar brain wave frequencies as a meditative state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Eckelkamp|first1=Stephanie|title=Laughter Therapy is the New Meditation|url=http://time.com/84987/laughter-may-be-the-new-meditation/|website=Time.com|accessdate=24 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, scientific studies of these benefits are limited and have methodological issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Martin, R. A.|title=Humor, laughter, and physical health: Methodological issues and research findings.|journal=Psychological Bulletin|date=2001|volume=127|issue=4|pages=504–519|doi=10.1037/0033-2909.127.4.504}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Anarchist law''' is a hypothetical body of norms regarding behavior and decision-making that might be operative in an anarchist community. The term is used in  a series of ongoing debates within the various branches of [[anarchist]] theory regarding if and how norms of individual and/or collective behavior, [[decision-making]] and actions should be created and enforced.

In Korean art history, the '''Baekje smile''' is the common smile motif found in [[Baekje]] sculpture and bas-relief.  Baekje figures express a unique smile that has been described as both enigmatic and subtle.  The smile has been also been characterized in many different ways from "genuinely glowing" to "thin and mild" to "unfathomable and benevolent".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.museeguimet.fr/gb/pages/page_id17980_u1l2.htm |title=Archived copy |access-date=2006-06-21 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061121125905/http://www.museeguimet.fr/gb/pages/page_id17980_u1l2.htm |archive-date=2006-11-21 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dynamic-korea.com/culture/view.php?main=LEC&amp;uid=200500022289]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.asianinfo.org/asianinfo/korea/scu/paekche_period.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;

Of all the [[Three Kingdoms of Korea|Three Kingdoms]], Baekje art was stylistically the most realistic and technically sophisticated {{Fact|date=February 2007}}.  While [[Goguryeo]] sculpture was highly rigid and [[Silla]] sculpture was formalized, Baekje sculpture exhibited distinct characteristics of warmth, softness, and used relaxed poses.  [http://www.britannica.com/ebi/article-9057960].  Sometimes, the Baekje style has been attributed to influence from the southern Chinese dynasties.  [http://www.britannica.com/ebi/article-9057960].  However, the most remarkable feature of Baekje sculpture is the distinctive Baekje smile.  [http://www.britannica.com/ebi/article-9057960].   The smile gives the Baekje statues a sense of friendliness and an air of pleasantness that is rarely found in other traditions of [[Buddhist]] sculpture. The smile is considered to be unique and distinctive.  [http://www.buddhamuseum.com/korean-buddha.html].

'''Hedvig Kristina Elisabeth "Betty" Deland''' (14 November 1831 in [[Örebro]] – 1 April 1882 in [[Stockholm]]) was a Swedish stage actress.  She was a principal of the ''[[Dramatens elevskola]]'' and belong to the elite of Swedish 19th-century actors.  She was known as Betty Deland until 1857 and then as Betty Almlöf. 

==Life==

=== Early career ===

Betty Deland was the daughter of the actors [[Pierre Deland]] and [[Charlotta Deland]].  She was born into two famous Swedish theatrical families: her father was the director of the famous travelling Deland theater company, and her mother was the daughter of [[Isaac de Broen]], director of the ''[[Djurgårdsteatern]]''.  She was the niece of [[Louis Deland]]. 

Betty Deland made her debut in the [[Royal Dramatic Theatre]] in 1836, the age of five, as a child actor in a boy's [[breeches role]], Otto in ''Johanna of Montfaucon''.  The following years, she made a success in children's roles.  

=== Stage career ===

Betty Deland was engaged in her father's travelling Deland theater company from 1847 until 1861.  She often performed a dance at the end of the performances of the Deland theater "with a [[cachucha]], performed in a Spanish costume in a very delightful way and with some of her father's French grace".&lt;ref&gt;H C E (Betty) Almlöf (f. Deland), urn:sbl:5689, Svenskt biografiskt lexikon (art av N. Personne.), hämtad 2018-06-16. &lt;/ref&gt;

She made her formal debut as an actress of her father's company in [[Uppsala]] in 1847.   The travelling Deland theater was one of the most famed in both Sweden and Finland during its existence between 1833 and 1861: it performed in the theaters of smaller cities and towns in Sweden and Finland, which seldom had a permanent staff at this point in history, and inaugurated several of the new theaters which was erected during this time, when many small cities built their first permanent theater buildings to house the travelling theater companies.  In Stockholm, they often performed in the ''[[Djurgårdsteatern]]'', and in Finland, the Deland company regularly performed in the ''[[Åbo Svenska Teater]]'', and they formed the first staff of the first national theater, the [[Swedish Theatre]] in [[Helsinki]], which was inaugurated in the 1860-61 season.  Betty Deland was a significant member of the Deland theater and well known in Sweden and Finland, and during her years there, she performed 300 roles in comedy and [[vaudeville]].&lt;ref&gt;H C E (Betty) Almlöf (f. Deland), urn:sbl:5689, Svenskt biografiskt lexikon (art av N. Personne.), hämtad 2018-06-16. &lt;/ref&gt; 

In 1857, she married the actor [[Knut Almlöf]], and was henceforth known as Betty Almlöf. Her spouse was also from a theater family, son of [[Nils Almlöf]] and [[Brita Catharina Cederberg]] and stepson of [[Charlotta Almlöf]].  

[[File:Betty Deland som Fadette.jpg|thumb|Betty Deland as [[Fadette]].]]

In 1861, Betty Almlöf was at the ''[[Mindre teatern]]'' in Stockholm with her spouse.  When the theater was incorporated to the [[Royal Dramatic Theatre]] in 1863, they were offered to stay.  In 1866, she was contracted as a premier actress.  She enjoyed great respect and came to have a successful career at the royal theater.   She was active on the stage until the year of her death, in 1882. 

Being previously known for comedy and vaudeville, her career shifted in the 1860s: "At Mindre teatern and even more after her engagement at the royal stage, she evolved to the character roles, where she with equal ability performed the most shifting types. The same truth, the same balance, the same striking strength of line and the same direction toward realism, which signified the art of her husband, was also found in her, fostered as she was in the strict school of her genius father."&lt;ref&gt;H C E (Betty) Almlöf (f. Deland), urn:sbl:5689, Svenskt biografiskt lexikon (art av N. Personne.), hämtad 2018-06-16. &lt;/ref&gt;

She was praised for her expressive mimic, her nuances of voice and her character acting, though her most popular roles mentioned in theater history remained those girls' roles and comic parts of the first half of her career.  

Betty Almlöf was an instructor and principal of the ''Dramatens elevskola'' jointly with her husband between 1874 and 1877.

===Roles ===

Among her parts were [[Madame de Maintenon]] in ''Ludvig den fjortonde och markisinnan Maintenon'' (Louis XIV and Madame de Maintenon), Mrs Serpentier in ''Den gifta mannen i staden och på landet'' (The married man in the city and in the country), Emilia in ''[[Othello]]'', the queen dowager [[Hedwig Eleonora of Holstein-Gottorp|Hedwig Eleonora]] in ''Carl den elfte'' (Charles XI) by Teodor Hagberg, Belise in ''Lärdt folk i stubb'' (The precieuses) by Molière, Mrs Dupuis in ''Ett hem'' (A home) by Feuillet, Fadette in ''Syrsan'' (Le petite Fadette) by George Sand, Dorine in ''[[Tartuffe]]'', the Duchess of Marlborough in ''Ett glas vatten'' (A glass of water), Frosine in ''Den girige'' (The greedy one) by Molière, Madam Rundholmen in ''De ungas förbund'' (The union of the young) by Ibsen and the Duchess in ''Sällskap där man har tråkigt'' (Company where one is bored) by Pailleron.

'''''Bokuseki''''' (墨跡) is a Japanese term meaning "ink trace", and refers to a form of Japanese calligraphy  ([[Shodo]]) and more specifically a style of [[Zenga]] developed by [[Zen]] monks. Bokuseki is often characterized by bold, assertive, and often abstract brush strokes meant to demonstrate the calligrapher’s pure state of mind (see [[Samādhi (Buddhism)|Samadhi]]). The aim in making Bokuseki is  to represent ones single-moment awareness by brushing each word or passage with a single breath, ultimately realizing Zen and manifesting ones [[Zazen]] practice into physical and artistic action. Fundamentally Bokuseki is a reflection of one's spontaneous action (see: [[Buddha-nature]], [[Katsu (Zen)|katsu]]) free from one’s superficial or [[Rationality|rationally]] oriented mind.

'''BookCrossing''' (also '''BC''', '''BCing''' or '''BXing''') is defined as "the practice of leaving a [[book]] in a [[public place]] to be picked up and read by others, who then do likewise." The term is derived from bookcrossing.com, a free online book club which was founded to encourage the practice, aiming to "make the whole world a library."

The "crossing" or exchanging of books may take any of a number of forms, including wild-releasing books in public, direct swaps with other members of the websites, or "book rings" in which books travel in a set order to participants who want to read a certain book. The community aspect of BookCrossing.com has grown and expanded in ways that were not expected at the outset, in the form of blog or forum discussions, mailing lists and annual conventions throughout the world.

==History==
Leaving reading materials in public places when no longer needed has long been a silent means of communication and sociability amongst bibliophiles.  Ron Hornbaker conceived the idea for what is now known as BookCrossing in March 2001&lt;ref name="sitesay"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/tech/webguide/internetlife/2002-09-11-book-crossing_x.htm|title=Site Says 'If you Love a Book, Set it Free'|accessdate=2008-03-27|date=2002-09-11|author=Dan Nephin|work=USA Today}}&lt;/ref&gt; and enlisted business partners and co-founders Bruce and Heather Pedersen&lt;ref name="bookcrossing-official"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bookcrossing.com/management|title=BookCrossing.com Management|author=BookCrossing.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; to launch BookCrossing.com on April 21, 2001.&lt;ref name="bookcrossing-init"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bookcrossing.com/faqs|title=BookCrossing.com FAQs|author=BookCrossing.com|accessdate=2016-01-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After two years the website had over 113,000 members and by 2004 it was prominent enough to be referenced in an episode of the [[Australia]]n [[soap opera]] ''[[Neighbours]]''.&lt;ref name="neighbours"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bookcrossing.com/forum/5/1333159|title=tv show neighbours promotes bookcrossing|accessdate=2008-04-04|date=2004-11-15|author='mattster27'|work=bookcrossing.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same year it appeared as a new word in the ''[[Concise Oxford Dictionary]],''&lt;ref name="coed"&gt;{{cite book | title=Concise Oxford English Dictionary| last=Soanes| first=Catherine|author2=Angus Stevenson| year=2006| publisher=Oxford University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; although as of 2017 only [[Collins Dictionary|Collins]] of the major online dictionaries retained it as a word.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/bookcrossing&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;filter=dictionary&amp;query=bookcrossing&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.macmillandictionary.com/spellcheck/british/?q=bookcrossing&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://dictionary.cambridge.org/spellcheck/english/?q=bookcrossing&lt;/ref&gt; Membership surpassed 1,000,000 by March 2012 and the registered book count exceeded 8,500,000.

In July 2007 [[Singapore]] became the first country to give the practice official status, designating 2,000 locations in the country as 'hotspots', similar to Official BookCrossing Zones, in an initiative launched with the [[National Library, Singapore|National Library of Singapore]].&lt;ref name="sing"&gt;{{Cite web| url= http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/singaporelocalnews/view/285965/1/.html|title=Singapore is First BookCrossing Country in the World|accessdate=2008-03-28|date=2007-07-03|author=Foo Xiao Xuan|work=Singapore News}}&lt;/ref&gt; The world's first official International BookCrossing Day took place on 21 April 2014.

===Awards===
In May 2005 BookCrossing.com won two People's Voice awards in the [[Webby Awards]] for best community website and best social/networking website.&lt;ref name="webbc"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bookcrossing.com/newscontent/137 |title=9th Annual Webby Awards: BookCrossing.com Named Best Community Website and Best Social/Networking Website in the People's Voice Awards |accessdate=2008-03-28 |date=2005-05-03 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080324082714/http://www.bookcrossing.com/newscontent/137 |archivedate=2008-03-24 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; BookCrossing was also featured in a [[BBC Radio]] project broadcast as 84 Book Crossing Road, which involved releasing 84 copies of [[Helene Hanff]]'s book ''[[84 Charing Cross Road]]'' around the world.  The programme was nominated for a [[Sony Radio Academy Awards|Sony Radio Academy Award]] in 2006.&lt;ref name="sraa"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.radioawards.org/winners/?category=The_Feature_Award&amp;year=2006|title=Sony  Radio Academy Awards|accessdate=2008-03-28|year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==About==
[[File:BookCrossingBefore.JPG|thumb|Books are "set free" into public places...]]
Anyone who wishes to officially participate in "releasing" books, whether leaving it in a public place or passing it on to a friend, may register on the BookCrossing.com website,&lt;ref name="freec"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/arts/main.jhtml?xml=/arts/2008/03/16/sv_freeculture.xml|title=Free Culture| accessdate=2008-03-28| date=2008-03-16| work=The Telegraph | location=London | first1=Horatia | last1=Harrod | first2=Marianna | last2=Walker}}&lt;/ref&gt; although there is the option to remain anonymous when "catching" or recording the find of a book. BookCrossing.com users can 'go hunting', where a member will go to the website to view a list of books that have recently been "released", then go to the location it was left to "catch" it. Books may also be left at "Official BookCrossing Zones" (OBCZs), which are located in certain coffee shops, cafes, restaurants and other public places. The purpose of these locations is to get current members in the area to leave books to share with the public. This also advertises BookCrossing and creates more members.&lt;ref name="spi"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.seattlepi.com/books/138088_bookcrossing05.html|title=Readers are Leaving a Trail of Free Books All Over the Place|accessdate=2008-03-27|date=2003-09-05|author=Rebekah Denn|work=The Seattle Post-Intelligencer}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Conventions and unconventions===
There is a BookCrossing anniversary convention every April,&lt;ref name="con"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bookcrossing.com/convention|title=BookCrossing - Conventions|accessdate=2010-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; where BookCrossers go to enjoy organized literary-related events and release books together. The location of the convention changes each year: Here is a list of past and forthcoming conventions:

===Controversy and criticism===
In 2003, BookCrossing was criticized by the astrologer and novelist Jessica Adams, who claimed that books were being "[[devalued]]" by the website as BookCrossing could lead to lower sales of books and, therefore, the reduction in [[royalties]] being paid to authors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.scotsman.com/lifestyle/culture/books/if-authors-love-books-then-they-should-set-them-free-1-1293703|title=If Authors Love Books, then they Should Set Them Free|last=Crummey| first=Andrey| date=2003-09-13|work=Scotland On Sunday |accessdate=2008-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most BookCrossers dispute this argument, however. They claim that the website introduces readers to authors and genres that they have not read before, that the website encourages more people to take up or reclaim reading as a [[hobby]], and that some members, having read a book that they have enjoyed, will buy extra copies to distribute through BookCrossing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.bookcrossing.com/faqs| title=BookCrossing - Frequently Asked Questions| accessdate=2010-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2005, Caroline Martin, [[managing director]] of the [[publishers|publisher]] Harper Press, said in a speech that "book publishing as a whole has its very own potential Napster crisis in the growing practice of bookcrossing".&lt;ref name="anov"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/money/main.jhtml?xml=/money/2006/10/16/cclife16.xml|title=A Novel Idea Has Led to Best-Sellers Turning up in the Strangest of Places|accessdate=2008-03-27|date=2006-10-15|author=Andrew Cave|work=The Telegraph | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;  BookCrossers rebutted the link to Napster, saying that while music filesharing involves duplicating audio files countless times, BookCrossing doesn't involve duplicating books (and also does not involve violating copyright, as books can be sold or given away freely without permission of the publisher being needed). The founder of BookCrossing, Ron Hornbaker, originally wondered if people would make this comparison when BookCrossing was first launched.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2003/feb/20/books.shopping|title=Finders Keepers|accessdate=2008-03-27|date=2003-02-20|author=Clint Witchalls|work=The Guardian | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Theosophy}}
The '''''Book of Dzyan''''' (comprising the '''''Stanzas of Dzyan''''') is a reputedly ancient text of [[Tibet]]an origin. The ''Stanzas'' formed the basis for ''[[The Secret Doctrine]]'' (1888), one of the foundational works of the [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|theosophical]]  movement, by [[Helena Blavatsky|Helena Petrovna Blavatsky]].

==Madame Blavatsky's claims regarding the ''Book of Dzyan''==

Madame Blavatsky claimed to have seen  a manuscript of the ''Book of Dzyan'' while studying [[esoteric]] lore in [[Tibet]]. She claimed this and other ancient manuscripts were safeguarded from profane eyes by  the initiates of an Occult Brotherhood. The work  had originally, according to Blavatsky, been written in the sacred language of [[Senzar language|Senzar]]. She wrote &lt;ref&gt;''The Secret Doctrine, Vol. 1'', [http://www.theosociety.org/pasadena/sd/sd1-0-in.htm Page xxxvii] Stanzas, which are (...) said to emanate from a source (Occultism) repudiated by science;&lt;/ref&gt;

:''This first installment of the esoteric doctrines is based upon Stanzas, which are the records of a people unknown to ethnology; it is claimed that they are written in a tongue absent from the nomenclature of languages and dialects with which philology is acquainted; they are said to emanate from a source (Occultism) repudiated by science; and, finally, they are offered through an agency, incessantly discredited before the world by all those who hate unwelcome truths, or have some special hobby of their own to defend. Therefore, the rejection of these teachings may be expected, and must be accepted beforehand. No one styling himself a "scholar," in whatever department of exact science, will be permitted to regard these teachings seriously.''

[[Max Müller]] and others have been skeptical. Max Müller is reported to have said that in this matter she was either a remarkable forger or that she has made the most valuable gift to archeological research in the Orient.&lt;ref&gt;Alvin Boyd Kuhn. ''Theosophy: A Modern Revival of Ancient Wisdom'' (New York, NY: Henry Holt and Company, 1939), Chapter VIII, page 195.&lt;/ref&gt;

==The ''Book of Dzyan'' and the Buddhist Tantras==

In other references Blavatsky claimed the ''Book of Dzyan'' belonged to a group of Tibetan esoteric writings known as the ''Books of Kiu-Te''.  Blavatsky wrote before a standard transcription of [[Tibetan alphabet|Tibetan]] into the Latin alphabet had been agreed upon; it took [[David Reigle]] some time to establish that she was referring to what modern scholars write as ''rGyud-sde'', parts of a voluminous Buddhist corpus commonly referred to as the [[Tantras]].&lt;ref&gt;David and Nancy Reigle. ''Blavatsky's Secret Books'' (San Diego: Wizards Bookshelf, 1999).&lt;/ref&gt; Other researchers have suggested a source in Chinese [[Taoism]] or Jewish [[Kabbalah|kabbala]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Nicholas Goodrick-Clarke]]. ''Helena Blavatsky'' (Berkeley: North Atlantic Books, 2006).&lt;/ref&gt;

==The ''Stanzas of Dzyan'' in the works of other authors==

Supposed verses from the same ''Stanzas of Dzyan'' were later published by [[Alice Bailey]] in ''A Treatise on Cosmic Fire'' in 1925. Bailey claimed these verses had been dictated to her telepathically  by the Tibetan Master [[Djwhal Khul|Djwal Kul]].

[[Ufology|Ufologist]] [[Desmond Leslie]] drew heavily on the ''Stanzas of Dzyan'' in his writing,&lt;ref&gt;Desmond Leslie &amp; George Adamski: ''Flying Saucers Have Landed'', London: Werner Laurie, 1953&lt;/ref&gt; and theorized that they had originally been produced on the lost continent of [[Atlantis]].

Swiss author [[Erich von Däniken]] claimed to have explored some of the book's content and its alleged history, reporting unsourced rumours that the first version of the book predates [[Earth]], and that chosen people who simply touch the book will receive visions of what it describes.&lt;ref&gt;Erich von Däniken. ''Gods From Outer Space'' (New York: Bantam Books, 1972), p. 137.&lt;/ref&gt;

References to the ''Stanzas'' exist in the fiction of [[H. P. Lovecraft]], for example in his short story "The Haunter of the Dark",&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hplovecraft.com/writings/texts/fiction/hd.aspx The Haunter of the Dark]&lt;/ref&gt; and have been expanded upon by other writers who have worked within the [[Cthulhu Mythos]].{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}

==Criticism regarding the sources of the ''Stanzas of Dzyan''==

When ''The Secret Doctrine'' appeared, William Emmette Coleman was  “outraged by Madame Blavatksy’s pretensions of [[Oriental]] learning, [and] undertook a complete exegesis of her works."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.blavatskyarchives.com/colemansources1895.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;William Emmette Coleman, "The Sources of Madame Blavatsky's Writings", in [[Vsevolod Solovyov|''Vsevolod Sergeevich Solov'ev'']], ''A Modern Priestess of Isis'', Appendix C, pp. 353-366 (London: Longmans &amp; Co., 1895). Available as a free download [http://www.kobobooks.com/ebook/A-modern-priestess-of-Isis/book-cMDPJXVOWkCxQGIftLMgbA/page1.html]&lt;/ref&gt; He claimed that her main sources were H.H. Wilson’s translations of the [[Vishnu Purana]]; [[Alexander Winchell (geologist)|Alexander Winchell]]’s ''World Life: or, Contemporary Geology''; [[Ignatius Donnely]]’s ''[[Atlantis: The Antediluvian World]]'' (1882); and other contemporary scientific and occult works, plagiarized without credit and, in his own opinion, used in a blundering manner that showed superficial acquaintance with the subjects under discussion.  He further claimed that she took at least part of her ''Stanzas of Dzyan'' from the [[Hymn of Creation]] in the old Sanskrit [[Rig-Veda]]. Coleman promised a book that would expose all of H.P.B.’s sources including that of the word ''Dzyan''. &lt;ref&gt;[[L. Sprague de Camp]]. ''[[Lost Continents]]: The Atlantis Theme in History, Science, and Literature'' (New York: The Gnome Press Inc., 1954; reprint: Dover Publications, 1970), pp. 57-58.&lt;/ref&gt;

In her biography ''HPB: The Extraordinary Life and Influence of Helena Blavatsky'', Sylvia Cranston tackles the claim of plagiarism that was leveled by William Emmette Coleman.&lt;ref&gt;Sylvia Cranston. ''H.P.B.: The Extraordinary Life and Influence of Helena Petrovna Blavatsky'' (New York: Tarcher/Putnam, 1993), p. 379-387.&lt;/ref&gt;  Her view, like Coleman's, is that HPB's plagiarism consisted of quoting primary sources, without acknowledging the secondary sources from which they came.

Cranston states that a research assistant of hers took on the task of finding Coleman's alleged 70 passages that HPB plagiarized from ''World-Life'', and could only find 6. Coleman himself, far from being an authority on [[occult]] material, was a clerk in the [[Quartermaster]] Department of the [[US Army]].  He was likely not an impartial judge, having written to Coues on July 8, 1890, "I emphatically denounced and ridiculed the theory of occultism, of elementary spirits, etc., before the Theosophical Society was organized [in 1875], and from that time to this I have strenuously opposed Theosophy all the time." &lt;ref&gt;Cranston, op.cit. p 380, citing William Q Judge, ''The Esoteric She'', reprinted in ''H. P. Blavatsky: Her Life and Work''.&lt;/ref&gt; Coleman promised to publish a book that would "prove" his charges against Blavatsky regarding the ''Book of Dzyan''; this book and its proof never appeared.&lt;ref&gt;Sylvia Cranston. ''H.P.B.: The Extraordinary Life and Influence of Helena Petrovna Blavatsky'' (New York: Tarcher/Putnam, 1993), p. 384.&lt;/ref&gt; The reason Coleman's book never appeared is that “Coleman lost his library and his notes in the [[1906 San Francisco earthquake]] and died three years later, his book unwritten”.&lt;ref&gt;L. Sprague de Camp. ''Lost Continents: The Atlantis Theme in History, Science, and Literature'' (New York: Dover Publications, 1954), p. 58.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017, research by British Future suggested that the [[Conservative Party (UK)]] would have claimed a 42-seat majority in the [[2017 general election]] if they had the same level of support among ethnic minority Britons as they do with white voters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Peter |last=Walker|title=‘Ethnic minority voting gap’ cost Theresa May 28 seats, report says|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/sep/28/ethnic-minority-voting-gap-cost-theresa-may-28-seats-report-says |accessdate=5 April 2018|newspaper=The Guardian|date=28 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''Canadian Historical Review''''' ('''''CHR''''') is a scholarly journal in Canada,&lt;ref name="Gough2010"&gt;{{cite book|author=Barry M. Gough|title=Historical Dictionary of Canada|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=z4xK6CasigkC&amp;pg=PR10|date=28 October 2010|publisher=Scarecrow Press|isbn=978-0-8108-7504-3|pages=10–}}&lt;/ref&gt; founded in 1920 and published by [[the University of Toronto Press]].&lt;ref name=canenc&gt;[http://thecanadianencyclopedia.com/en/article/canadian-historical-review/ "Canadian Historical Review"]. ''The Canadian Encyclopedia''&lt;/ref&gt; The ''CHR'' publishes articles about the ideas, people, and events important to Canadian history,&lt;ref name="JamesonBourne1922"&gt;{{cite book|author1=John Franklin Jameson|author2=Henry Eldridge Bourne|author3=Robert Livingston Schuyler|title=The American Historical Review|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YW4KAQAAMAAJ|year=1922|publisher=American Historical Association}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as book reviews and detailed bibliographies of recent Canadian historical publications. The ''CHR'' covers all topics of Canadian history, ranging from Indigenous issues to liberalism to the First World War. The ''CHR'' has two major objectives: "to promote high standards of research and writing in Canada … and to foster the study of Canadian history."&lt;ref name=shore&gt;''The contested past'' [electronic resource]: reading Canada's history: selections from the Canadian historical review / edited by Marlene Shore&lt;/ref&gt;

''Canadian Historical Review'' publishes articles in both of Canada's official languages, French and English. The Journal publishes both online and print versions, and subscribers can search for and read thousands of past publications via either ''CHR'' Online or [[Project MUSE]].

==History==
The ''Canadian Historical Review'' was founded at the [[University of Toronto]] in 1920&lt;ref name="Edwardson2008"&gt;{{cite book|author=Ryan Edwardson|title=Canadian Content: Culture and the Quest for Nationhood|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IxVuSFLo8fAC&amp;pg=PA29|year=2008|publisher=University of Toronto Press|isbn=978-0-8020-9519-0|pages=29–}}&lt;/ref&gt; as a continuation of a previous journal, the ''Review of Historical Publications Relating to Canada'', itself founded by George Wrong,&lt;ref name="DarnellGleach2007"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Regna Darnell|author2=Frederic Wright Gleach|title=Histories of Anthropology Annual|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ho55L7Us1jQC&amp;pg=PA53|year=2007|publisher=U of Nebraska Press|isbn=0-8032-6664-2|pages=53–}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1897.&lt;ref name=canenc /&gt;&lt;ref name="Clark2011"&gt;{{cite book|author=Penney Clark|title=New Possibilities for the Past: Shaping History Education in Canada|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kP6WDIWZpdwC&amp;pg=PA40|date=22 August 2011|publisher=UBC Press|isbn=978-0-7748-2061-5|pages=40–}}&lt;/ref&gt; The initiative to digitize the ''CHR''{{'}}s holdings includes material from this previous journal, and papers from as early as 1897 are available to subscribers online as a result.

The ''Canadian Historical Review''{{'}}s entries have changed as history and historiography itself have progressed. Marlene Shore's ''The Contested Past: Reading Canada's History – Selections from the Canadian Historical Review'', tracks these changes, tracing major themes of the ''CHR'' chronologically: "Nation and Diversity, 1920-1939; War, Centralization; and Reaction, 1940-1965; The Renewal of Diversity, 1966 to present; and Reflections."&lt;ref name=shore /&gt;  ''The Contested Past'' also suggests that the key themes in Canadian history reflected by the ''CHR'' are "Native-European contact, society and war, the nature of Canadian and Quebec nationalism, class-consciousness, and gender politics." &lt;ref name=shore /&gt;

==Editors==
The ''CHR''{{'}}s current Editors are Matthew Hayday and Jeffrey McNairn. Matthew Hayday, a professor at the University of Guelph since 2007, focuses on Canadian political history, particularly issues related to language policy, education, social movements, nationalism and identity politics. Jeffrey McNairn teaches nineteenth-century Canadian history at Queen's University, with special interest in the history of print, liberalism, British imperialism and state-civil society relations.&lt;ref name="University of Toronto Press Online"&gt;University of Toronto Press Online&lt;/ref&gt;

The Editorial Board comprises Harold Bérubé from Université de Sherbrooke, Jarvis Brownlie from the University of Manitoba, Kevin Brushett from the Royal Military College of Canada, Jordan Stanger-Ross from the University of Victoria and Shirley Tillotson from Dalhousie University. The Book Review Editor is Donald Wright, from the University of New Brunswick.&lt;ref name="University of Toronto Press Online"/&gt;

==''Canadian Historical Review'' Prize==
Each year ''CHR'' awards a prize to their choice for best article of the year, known as the ''Canadian Historical Review Prize''. The most recent winner was Jan Noel, who won in 2017 for her article "A Man of Letters and Gender Troubles of 1837", which appeared in the September 2017 issue.

==History==
'''Coastal and Intertidal Zone Archaeological Network''' was launched in 2015&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.archaeology.co.uk/articles/citizan-triumphs.htm|title=CITiZAN triumphs - Current Archaeology (CA341)|accessdate=13 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-33821094|title=Shores are 'final frontier' for archaeology project - BBC News p.7 August 2015|accessdate=13 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is a community archaeology project working the North, South East and South West of England. The project's main host is the [[Museum of London Archaeology]] with project partners the [[Council for British Archaeology]] and the [[Nautical Archaeology Society]]. The project is sponsored by the [[Heritage Lottery Fund]], [[The National Trust]], [[The Crown Estate]], and [[Historic England]].

{{Refimprove|date=September 2014}}
[[Image:absolute complement.svg|200px|thumb|In this image, the '''universal set''' U (the entire rectangle) is dichotomized into the two sets A (in pink) and its complement A&lt;sup&gt;c&lt;/sup&gt; (in grey).]]
A '''dichotomy''' {{IPAc-en|d|aɪ|ˈ|k|ɒ|t|ə|m|i}} is a [[partition of a set|partition]] of a whole (or a set) into two parts (subsets). In other words, this couple of parts must be
* [[jointly exhaustive]]: everything must belong to one part or the other, and
* [[mutually exclusive]]: nothing can belong simultaneously to both parts.

Such a partition is also frequently called a bipartition.

&lt;!-- this is a confused sentence - clearly ME and JE are NOT mutually exclusive, please re-phrase if you know how it works: 
These two ways to [[partition of a set|partition]] elements are themselves a dichotomy. --&gt;
The two parts thus formed are [[Complement (set theory)|complements]]. In [[logic]], the partitions are [[dual (category theory)|opposites]] if there exists a [[proposition]] such that it holds over one and not the other.

Treating [[continuous variable]]s or multi[[categorical variable]]s as [[binary variable]]s is called [[discretization|dichotomization]]. The [[discretization error]] inherent in dichotomization is temporarily ignored for [[conceptual model|modeling]] purposes.

== Etymology ==

The term ''dichotomy'' is from the Greek language {{lang-el|διχοτομία}} ''dichotomía'' "dividing in two" from δίχα ''dícha'' "in two, asunder" and τομή ''tomḗ'' "a cutting, incision".

== Usage and examples==

* The above applies directly when the term is used in [[mathematics]], [[philosophy]], [[literature]], or [[linguistics]]. For example, if there is a concept A, and it is split into parts B and not-B, then the parts form a dichotomy: they are mutually exclusive, since no part of B is contained in not-B and vice versa, and they are jointly exhaustive, since they cover all of A, and together again give A.
* In [[set theory]], a dichotomous relation ''R'' is such that either ''aRb'', ''bRa'', but not both.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Komjath|first1=Peter|last2=Totik|first2=Vilmos|title=Problems and Theorems in Classical Set Theory|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rbCmt-2NxtIC&amp;lpg=PA497&amp;ots=_iKgXwG7Qa&amp;dq=dichotomous%20relation%20set%20theory&amp;pg=PA497#v=onepage&amp;q=dichotomous%20relation%20set%20theory&amp;f=false|website=Google Books|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|accessdate=17 September 2014|pages=497|year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In [[statistics]], dichotomous data may only exist at first two [[levels of measurement]], namely at the [[nominal scale|nominal]] level of measurement (such as "British" vs "American" when measuring nationality) and at the [[ordinal scale|ordinal]] level of measurement (such as "tall" vs "short", when measuring height). A variable measured dichotomously is called a [[dummy variable (statistics)|dummy variable]]. 
* In the [[classification of mental disorders]] in [[psychiatry]] or [[clinical psychology]], dichotomous classification or [[categorization]] refers to the use of cut-offs intended to separate disorder from non-disorder at some level of abnormality, severity or disability.
* A [[false dichotomy]] is an [[informal fallacy]] consisting of a supposed dichotomy which fails one or both of the conditions: it is not jointly exhaustive and/or not mutually exclusive. In its most common form, two entities are presented as if they are exhaustive, when in fact other alternatives are possible. In some cases, they may be presented as if they are mutually exclusive although there is a broad middle ground (see also [[undistributed middle]]).
* The divine dichotomy is mentioned in the ''[[Conversations With God]]'' series of books by religious author [[Neale Donald Walsch]].
* In economics, the [[classical dichotomy]] is the division between the real side of the economy and the monetary side. According to the classical dichotomy, changes in monetary variables do not affect real values such as output, employment, and the real interest rate. Money is therefore neutral in the sense that its quantity cannot affect these real variables.
* In [[biology]], a dichotomy is a division of organisms into two groups, typically based on a characteristic present in one group and absent in the other. Such dichotomies are used as part of the process of identifying species, as part of a [[dichotomous key]], which asks a series of questions, each of which narrows down the set of organisms. A well known dichotomy is the question "does it have a backbone?" used to divide species into [[vertebrate]]s and [[invertebrate]]s.
* In [[botany]], a dichotomy is a mode of branching by repeated [[wikt:bifurcation|bifurcation]] - thus a focus on branching rather than on division.
* In [[computer science]], more specifically in programming-language engineering, dichotomies are fundamental dualities in a language's design. For instance, [[C++]] has a dichotomy in its memory model (heap versus stack), whereas Java has a dichotomy in its type system (references versus primitive data types).
* In the anthropological field of [[theology]] and in [[philosophy]], dichotomy is the belief that humans consist of a soul and a body. (See [[Mind-body dichotomy]].) This stands in contrast to [[Trichotomy (philosophy)|trichotomy]].
* Perceived dichotomies are common in Western thought. [[C. P. Snow]] believes that Western society has become an argument culture ([[The Two Cultures]]). In ''The Argument Culture'' (1998), [[Deborah Tannen]] suggests that the dialogue of Western culture is characterized by a warlike atmosphere in which the winning side has truth (like a trophy). Such a dialogue virtually ignores the middle alternatives.
* In [[sociology]] and [[semiotics]], dichotomies (also sometimes called 'binaries' and/or 'binarisms') are the subject of attention because they may form the basis to divisions and inequality. For example, the [[Domestic-public dichotomy|domestic–public dichotomy]] divides men's and women's roles in a society; the [[East-West dichotomy]] contrasts the [[Orient]] and the [[Western world|Occident]]. Some social scientists attempt to [[Deconstruction|deconstruct]] dichotomies in order to address the divisions and inequalities they create: for instance [[Judith Butler]]'s deconstruction of the [[gender]]-dichotomy (or [[gender binary]]) and [[Val Plumwood]]'s deconstruction of the human-[[social environment|environment]] dichotomy.
* The [[I Ching]] and [[taijitu]] represent the yin yang theories of traditional [[Chinese culture]]. However, these do not represent a true dichotomy as the symbol incorporates a portion of each in the other, representing a dialectic.
* In [[dialectical behavioral therapy]], a treatment shown to have some success in treating some clients with [[Borderline Personality Disorder]], an essential tool used is based on the idea of dichotomy. Dichotomy, in this case, is a self-defeating behavior using "all-or-nothing" or [[splitting (psychology)|"black-and-white" thinking]]. The therapy teaches the patient how to change the dichotomy to a more "[[dialectical]]" (or "seeing the middle ground") way of thinking.
* One type of dichotomy is dichotomous classification - classifying objects by recursively splitting them into two groups until all are separated and in their own unique category.
* [http://dic.academic.ru/dic.nsf/mwc/16540/dichotomy Astronomy] defines a dichotomy as "the phase of the moon or an inferior planet in which half its disk appears illuminated".

'''Gender systems''' are the [[social structures]] that establish the number of genders and their associated [[gender role]]s in every society.  A ''gender role'' is "everything that a person says and does to indicate to others or to the self the degree that one is either male, female, or androgynous. This includes but is not limited to sexual and erotic arousal and response."&lt;ref name=Nanda-1990&gt;Nanda, Serena. Neither Man nor Woman: the Hijras of India. Belmont, CA: Wadsworth Pub., 1990. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|114}}  [[Gender identity]] is one's own personal experience with gender role and the persistence of one's individuality as male, female, or androgynous, especially in self-awareness and behavior.
[[Gender binary]] is one example of a gender system.  A ''gender binary'' is the classification of sex and gender into two distinct and disconnected forms of masculine and feminine.

==Non-European gender systems==
In cultures where the gender binary is prominent and important, [[transgender]] people are a major exception to the societal norms related to gender.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}} [[Intersex]] people, those who cannot be biologically determined as either male or female, are another obvious deviation. Other cultures have their own practices independent of the Western gender binary.

===Native American===
When European settlers first arrived in North America, they discovered different Native American tribes had different concepts of sex and gender. In the Native North American society "[[two-spirit|berdaches]]" were given that name to identify them as gender variants. The Europeans "attempted to explain the berdache from various functional perspectives...in terms of the contributions these sex/gender roles made to social structure or culture."&lt;ref name=Nanda-1999&gt;Nanda, Serena. Gender Diversity: Crosscultural Variations. Waveland Press, 1999. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|11}}  The term "berdache" was deemed inappropriate and insulting as time passed and awareness increased, so a new term was coined in 1990, "[[Two-Spirit]]."&lt;ref name=Nanda-1999 /&gt;{{rp|13}} There were many roles for male and female [[Two-Spirits]], productive specialization, supernatural sanction and gender variation. Some widespread features of the variety of gender roles are: transvestism, cross-gender occupation, same sex (but different gender) sexuality, recruitment to different roles, special languages, ritual roles, and associations with spiritual power.&lt;ref name=Nanda-1999 /&gt;{{rp|14}}  [[Cross-dressing]] was the most visible marker but has proven a variable and less reliable indicator of status as a [[Two-Spirit]]. However the main interest is that these people are an accepted portion of their society. In some cases they were even given special respect and various honors. 
The roles varied greatly between tribes.  For example, a male variant might have to wear male clothing during warfare, but women’s clothing any other time.  These [[gender role]]s were often decided at a young age.  If a boy was interested in women’s activities, or vice versa, a gender variant role would likely be undertaken in adulthood.  "In some societies, same-sex sexual desire or practice did figure into the definition of one’s gender variant role, in others, it did not."&lt;ref name=Nanda-1999 /&gt;{{rp|19}}
In the case of the [[Navajo people|Navajo]], there were four genders: man, woman, masculine female-bodied [[nádleeh]], and feminine male-bodied nádleeh.  Intercourse between two people of different genders, regardless of biological sex, was not stigmatized.  However, any sexual relationship between two of the same one gender was considered homosexual, and was strongly disapproved of.  In the majority of [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] societies however, biological sex played no part in any gender variant role.&lt;ref name=Nanda-1999 /&gt;{{rp|13}}

====The Mohave Alyha====
In [[Mohave people|Mohave]] society, pregnant women believed they had dreams [[forecasting]] the anatomic [[sex]] of their children.  These dreams also sometimes included hints of their child’s future [[gender variance|gender variant]] status.  
A boy who "acted strangely" before he participated in the boy’s puberty ceremonies in the Mohave tribe would be considered for the transvestite ceremony.  Expressing interest in dolls, the domestic work of women, women’s gambling games, and inquiring about the female skirt were all ways a boy may be considered for the transvestite ceremony.  Before the ceremony, relatives would try to dissuade him, but if the boy persists, they would assist in the preparations for the ceremony.
The ceremony itself was meant to surprise the boy.  It was a test of willingness.  Other nearby settlements would receive word to come and watch.  A circle of onlookers would sing special songs.  If the boy danced like a woman, it confirmed his status as an ''alyha''.  He was then taken to a river to bathe, and was given a skirt to wear.  The ceremony would permanently change his gender status within the tribe.  He then took up a female name.  The alyha would imitate many aspects of female life, including [[menstruation]], [[puberty|puberty observations]], pregnancy, and birth.  The alyha were considered great healers, especially in curing [[sexually transmitted disease]]s like [[syphilis]].&lt;ref name=Nanda-1999 /&gt;{{rp|21&amp;ndash;23}}

=== Juchitán, Oaxaca, Mexico ===
{{one source|section|date=June 2011}}
A documentary film entitled ''[[Blossoms of Fire]]'', produced in 2000, depicts the people of [[Juchitán de Zaragoza|Juchitán de Zaragoza, Oaxaca, Mexico]]. It follows the daily lives of the women as they run their businesses, wear colorfully bold traditional clothing and hold their heads firmly high as they carry the weight on top. The film clearly depicts the empowered women and the tolerance of [[homosexuality]] and [[transgender]] individuals. The community exemplifies an alternative gender system unlike the [[gender binary]] that has been established throughout the world. On many occasions this community has been criticized and labeled as a [[matriarchy]]; however, the individuals who are interviewed throughout the film tend to say otherwise. They strongly believe that their community is able to function because [[gender roles]] are not placed on individuals but rather that everyone is equal—for example there is no identifiable "bread winner". Children are taken care of by whoever can help; food is cooked by anyone who is able to and drinking beer and smoking is not only okay for the "men" of the community. [[Gay]], [[lesbian]], and [[transgender]] people tend to feel more accepted in this alternative gender system. [[Juchitán de Zaragoza|Juchitán's]] society operates under a more egalitarian gender system in which men and women have different, but not exclusive roles, and in which these roles are not necessarily expected. Due to liberal gender performance, [[third gender]]s also have more prominence in [[Juchitán de Zaragoza|Juchitán]] than other parts of the world.&lt;ref&gt;''Blossoms of Fire''. Lydia Nibley. Say Yes Quickly Productions, Riding the Tiger Productions, and Just Media, 2010. DVD.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Machi (Mapuche Shamans) of Chile ===
{{one source|section|date=June 2011}}
The [[machi (shaman)|machi]] are the shamans of the [[Mapuche]] people of [[Chile]], and are viewed to a large extent by both [[Mapuche]] and the Chilean state as keepers of Mapuche political, cultural, and spiritual tradition and power. In many ways the [[Machi (shaman)|machi]] represent an alternative gender system in that homosexual acts are more accepted, gender switching occurs, and the practice of [[polygamy]] took place.&lt;ref name=Bacigalupo-2003&gt;Bacigalupo, Ana Mariella. "Mapuche Shamanic Bodies and the Chilean State: Polemic Gendered Representation and Indigenous Responses".'' Violence and the Body: Race, Gender, and the State''. Ed. A.J. Aldama. Bloomington Indiana: Indiana University Press. 2003. &lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|322-343}} However, though it appears there is more gender freedom, gender switching occurs based on different shamanic practices performed, and the gender associated with the practice is either derived from physical sex based on reproduction etc. or from the [[Hegemony|hegemonic]] gender system of the nation of [[Chile]]. For example, political participation has become a masculine practice, while spiritual practices are considered feminine. While one does not have to be a physical "male" or "female" necessarily to perform these practices, they must channel that gender to perform them.

The [[Machi (shaman)|machi]] were inevitably influenced by the dominant western gender system of [[Chile]] through state sponsored evangelization, (most [[Mapuche]] today are [[Catholic]])&lt;ref name=Bacigalupo-2003 /&gt;{{rp|327&amp;ndash;328}} and by the [[Indigenous peoples in Chile#The Indigenous Law|Indigenous Law]]. [[Indigenous peoples in Chile#The Indigenous Law|The Indigenous Law]] further politicized the machi and further subjected them in national discourse to the gender norms of the Chilean state, changing the way that [[Machi (shaman)|machi]] perform gender. "Machi juggle various gendered systems of knowledge and identities according to their intentions, who is present, and in what context"&lt;ref name=Bacigalupo-2003 /&gt;{{rp|334}}

===Indian Hindu===
In [[Hindu]] [[India]], there also exists different concepts of what is socially accepted when gender is in question.  When compared to the native North Americans, the gender system is essentially binary, but the ideas themselves are quite different from Western thoughts.  These ideas often come from religious contexts.  Some Hindu origin myths feature [[androgynous]] or hermaphroditic ancestors.  Ancient poets often showed this idea by presenting images with mixed physical attributes between the two sexes.  These themes still exist in the culture, and are even still institutionalized.  The most prominent group are the hijras.&lt;ref name=Nanda-1999 /&gt;{{rp|27,28}}

====Hijras====
{{main article|Hijra (South Asia)}}
[[File:Hijra.jpg|thumb|A Hijra from India.]]
{{one source|section|date=June 2011}}
"The recognition of more than two sex/genders is recorded in India as early as the eighth century BCE".&lt;ref name=Nanda-1999 /&gt;{{rp|29}} In modern [[India]], the term [[hijra (South Asia)|hijra]] is most commonly meant as "eunuch" or intersexed, and is a term of sexual impotence.  In the culture’s definition, a hijra is one born as a male, but adopts the clothing, behavior, and occupations of women. Their status in society is neither male nor female, neither man nor woman. When hijras are asked whether or not they are male or female, most often they respond with comments like "We hijras are like women",&lt;ref name=Nanda-1990 /&gt;{{rp|xxiii}} demonstrating their place in culture.  Hijras walk, gesture, speak, and use facial expressions more common to women in India.  They even take feminine names as part of their gender transformation. Becoming a Hijra however is not outside of Indian society. Being a hijra means making a commitment that gives social support and some economic security, as well as a cultural meaning, linking them to the larger world.&lt;ref name=Nanda-1990 /&gt;{{rp|54}}

"A male who is not born biologically intersexed who wishes to become a hijra must transform his sex/gender through an emasculation operation".&lt;ref name=Nanda-1999 /&gt;{{rp|29}}  This operation is a rebirth for the hijras, and contains elements of childbirth to symbolize this.  The process includes [[castration]], [[bloodletting]], and special rituals.&lt;ref name=Nanda-1999 /&gt;{{rp|33}}  Among the hijra society there is a hierarchy of gurus, or teachers, and chelas, or disciples.&lt;ref name=Nanda-1990 /&gt;{{rp|42}} In order for one to be accepted into the hijra society they must be sponsored by a guru, who in turn teaches them and helps them form a family.

As of November 11, 2013, the country of [[Bangladesh]] has decided to begin a third gender birth certificate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bangladesh’s Hijras Win Official Recognition as Separate Gender |url=http://globalvoicesonline.org/2013/11/13/bangladeshs-hijras-win-official-recognition-as-separate-gender/ |work=online article |publisher=Global Voices |accessdate=27 November 2013 |deadurl=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150609012908/http://globalvoicesonline.org/2013/11/13/bangladeshs-hijras-win-official-recognition-as-separate-gender/ |archivedate=June 9, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Sādhin====
The sādhin are similar to [[Hijra (South Asia)|Hijras]] culturally.  Their development is quite different however, and their existence is much less prominent.  It is a girl’s choice to become a sādhin.  They wear men’s clothing and keep their hair short.  They commonly keep their female name and are still treated as a female in society, although the status of sādhin, like hijra, transcends the gender labels of India.  A sādhin candidate must be a virgin, and swear to celibacy.&lt;ref name=Nanda-1999 /&gt;{{rp|40,41}}

===[[Naples]] and [[Southern Italy]]===
{{main article|Femminiello}}
''[[Femminielli]]'' or ''femmenielli'' (singular ''femminiello'', cf. [[Standard Italian]] ''femmina'', "a female", ''-ello'', masculine [[diminutive]] suffix) is a term used to refer to a population of males with markedly feminine gender expression in traditional [[Naples|Neapolitan]] culture.&lt;ref name="Corriere"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Fulvio |first1=Bufi |year=2009 |title=Presa Ketty, boss "femminiello" Comandava i pusher di Gomorra |journal=Corriere della Sera |issue=February 13, 2009 |pages=19 |url=http://archiviostorico.corriere.it/2009/febbraio/13/Presa_Ketty_boss_femminiello_Comandava_co_8_090213017.shtml |accessdate= |quote=FEMMINIELLO E' UNA FIGURA OMOSESSUALE (..)

It is often considered reductive to insert the Neapolitan ''femminiello'' within the macro-category of transgender usually adopted in Anglo-Saxon and North American contexts. The ''femminiello'', instead, could be considered as a peculiar gender expression, despite a widespread sexual binarism. The cultural roots of this phenomenon confer to the ''femminiello'' a cultural and even socially legitimized status. For the historical and symbolic coordinates of Naples, the identity construct of the ''femminiello'' is not superimposable to more common European and euro-centric transgender clusters.&lt;ref&gt;Hochdorn, Alexander, Paolo F.

The ''femminiello'' in [[Campania]] may enjoy a relatively privileged position thanks to their participation in some traditional events, such as ''Candelora al Santuario di Montevergine'' ([[Candlemas]] at the Sanctuary of [[Montevergine]]) in [[Avellino]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.incampania.com/EN/turismo.cfm?s=4&amp;Menu_ID=183&amp;Sub_ID=218&amp;Info_ID=3782 Il Santuario di Montevergine e la Candelora] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120127053541/http://www.incampania.com/EN/turismo.cfm?s=4&amp;Menu_ID=183&amp;Sub_ID=218&amp;Info_ID=3782 |date=2012-01-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt; or the ''Tammurriata'', a traditional dance performed at the feast of Madonna dell'Arco in [[Sant'Anastasia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.liceoumberto.eu/cartelle/altro/tammurriata.htm|title=Traditional Dances - The Tummurriata|author=|date=|website=liceoumberto.eu|accessdate=7 May 2018|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120325203119/http://www.liceoumberto.eu/cartelle/altro/tammurriata.htm|archivedate=25 March 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Generally, ''femminielli'' are considered good luck.

Achille della Ragione suggests that recent surveys have shown that Neapolitans have a generally negative view of what he calls "the politically correct model of homosexuality of a hypocritical do-gooder society" (implying the mainstream Western gay culture), yet he contrasts ''femminielli'' as enjoying a favorable attitude from part of Neapolitan society.&lt;ref name="Ragione"&gt;{{cite web |title=I femminielli |author=Achille della Ragione |url=http://www.guidecampania.com/dellaragione/articolo3/articolo.htm#99 |quote=Il napoletano, come dimostrano recenti statistiche, non vede di buon occhio l'omosessuale più o meno dichiarato, quello politically correct, che oggi, altrove, va tanto di moda ed è apparentemente accettato da una società ipocritamente buonista.

===Polynesia===
In [[Polynesia]] there are many different terms for [[gender role]]s, for example in [[Tahiti]] the role is called [[mahu (person)|māhū]]. In [[Samoa]] the male gender variant is called [[fa’afafine]] which means "like a woman." Tuva and Tonga have terms also.  In Tonga the term is fakaleiti and in Tuva the term is pinapinnaine. All of these terms are used when a male engages in women's work, clothes, speech tones, and nonverbal gestures. However, in [[Polynesia]] when a man crosses genders and "acts like a woman" he is not viewed as becoming a woman, but is suspended between male and female, being neither at the same time, but having the elements of both.&lt;ref name=Nanda-1999 /&gt;{{rp|57&amp;ndash;70}}  They tend to be effeminate and interested in women’s household tasks, but do not dress exclusively as women.  They often seek oral sex with men, who may ridicule them in public, but seek them out for pleasure in private.&lt;ref name=Rupp-2001&gt;Rupp, Leila J. "Toward a Global History of Same-Sex Sexuality." Journal of the History of Sexuality 10.2 (2001): pp. 287-302. Web.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|334}}

===Thailand===
[[Image:Kathoy1649.jpg|thumb|right|Kathoeys on the stage of a cabaret show in Pattaya.]]
[[Kathoey]] is the term used by both males and females that allows them to be alongside the normative masculine and feminine identities. Up until the 1970s [[hermaphrodites]] and cross-dressing men and women could all come under the term kathoey, however the term has been dropped for the cross-dressing masculine females who are now referred to as ''tom''.&lt;ref name=Nanda-1999 /&gt;{{rp|73}} As a result of the shifts, kathoey today is most commonly understood as a male [[transgender]] category. Kathoey is derived from the [[Buddhist]] myth that describes three original human sex/genders, male, female, and a biological hermaphrodite or kathoey.&lt;ref name=Nanda-1999 /&gt;{{rp|73}} Kathoey is not defined as merely being a variant between male or female but as an independently existing third sex.

===Philippines===
The notable gender variant role in the Philippines is the [[Bakla (Philippines)|bakla]].  Bakla are males with a feminine spirit, or core identity, who cross-dress and are assumed to take the receiving role in sex.  In the Philippines, a "real man" is simply one who is not bakla.  Since there are negative connotations of local terms for gender diversity, many bakla prefer to self-identify as gay, rather than a new gender.  The baklas’ partners are not considered homosexual by Filipino society.  Over time, baklas have tried to gain status as a [[third gender|third sex or gender]] as an attempt to normalize their nonconformity and be equal to males and females in society.&lt;&lt;ref name=Nanda-1999 /&gt;{{rp|78&amp;ndash;84}}

===Nigeria===
Oyewumi observes that among the [[Yoruba people]] there was no concept of gender and no gender system at all before [[colonialism]]. She argues that colonial powers used a gender system as a tool for domination and fundamentally changing social relations among the indigenous.&lt;ref name=Lugones-2011&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lugones|first=María|title=Heterosexualism and the Colonial/Modern Gender System|journal=Hypatia|date=Winter 2008|volume= 22|issue= 1|doi=10.1353/hyp.2006.0067}}&lt;!--|accessdate=9 May 2011--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|196&amp;ndash;198}}

==The cultural definition of homosexuality==
In cultures where the difference between male and female in the gender binary is masculine and feminine, it is important to look at how same-sex sexuality changes between cultures.  In some cultures, like the [[travesti|travestí]], homosexual behavior moves one from one part of a gender binary to another.

Homosexuality, and its effects on the individual’s place in society is sometimes drastically different in various other cultures.  In certain [[Sambia people]] of New Guinea for example, it is believed that a boy is unable to reach [[puberty]] or maturity without first ingesting the [[semen]], considered ''life-force'', of an older male.&lt;ref name=Peoples-2001&gt;Peoples, James G. "The Cultural Construction of Gender and Manhood." Men and Masculinity. 1st Edition ed.Cengage Learning, 2001. Print&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|9&amp;ndash;18}}  In addition, these Sambian people believe that a man is unable to replenish his semen on his own, so the ritual continues until a certain time, usually marriage, when he is told of a tree that exudes a milky semen-like sap he may ingest instead.&lt;ref name=Peoples-2001 /&gt;{{rp|18}}

In Basotho society in contemporary [[Lesotho]], girls and women may exchange long kisses, engage in [[cunnilingus]], and even fall in love and form a marriage-like union.  In this society however, sex requires penetration, and marriage requires a man as a husband.  Therefore, in this context, there is no concept of lesbianism.&lt;ref name=Rupp-2001 /&gt;{{rp|336}}

==The Alternative Model of Gender==
In "The Five Sexes: Why Male and Female Are Not Enough", Anne Fausto-Sterling explores the possibilities of the [[intersex]] and how these individuals fit into the traditional labeling of "male" and "female".  Her "Alternative Model of Gender," is a proposition that allows for the inclusion of intersexual individuals into the traditional gender labeling system. Anne Fausto-Sterling proposes that a body does not necessarily have to fit into the orthodox [[gender binary]] set by a society, but rather can be categorized under the possibility of [[male]], [[female]], merm, ferm, and herm, which are labels given to individuals born with a variation in sex characteristics. Fausto-Sterling’s "Of Gender and Genitals" discuses the fate of the individuals born with "ambiguous" genitalia and the need to surgically correct the deviations these individuals propel into a male-female society. 
She explores the need for allowing the body to be labeled as is, rather than configuring it into the expectations of society, as the traditional binary gender labeling calls for. The Alternative Model allows for this type of gender labeling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Fausto-Sterling|first=Anne|title=The Five Sexes: Why Male and Female Are Not Enough|journal=The Sciences|date=March–April 1993|pages=20–24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Fausto-Sterling|first=Anne|title=Sexing the Body: Gender Politics and the Construction of Sexuality|year=2000|publisher=Basic Books|location=New York|isbn=0-465-07714-5|pages=44–77}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gendered violence==
{{POV check|section|date=June 2011}}
Gendered violence is an important worldwide issue that can take place in different forms with varying consequences. It can be similar to a [[hate crime]] in which physical violence is specifically targeting the victim's gender. Transgender people and women experience the most gender violence but anyone can be a victim. Women are particularly at risk of gender violence in intimate relationships. Women are 10 times more likely to be a victim of intimate partner violence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Women's Voices Feminist Actions|last=Shaw|first=Susan M.|last2=Lee|first2=Janet|publisher=McGraw Hill Education|year=2015|isbn=978-0-07-802700-0|location=New York, NY|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This act of violence occurs in the public as well as the private domain and can sometimes be overlooked. Countless deaths have resulted from these severe crimes as seen in the film ''[[Two-Spirits|Two Spirits]]''.&lt;ref&gt;''Two Spirits''. Lydia Nibley. Say Yes Quickly Productions, Riding the Tiger Productions, and Just Media, 2010. DVD.&lt;/ref&gt; Organizations nationwide such as [[California Coalition Against Sexual Assault]] help to support and aid the Latino communities in particular to put an end to domestic violence. It is also a matter related to the dominant gender system, which often underlies the motives for gendered violence. The dominant gender system also creates [[structural violence]].&lt;ref name=Lugones-2011 /&gt;{{rp|188}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1056">The  ({{IPA-es|ɡɾaˈθjoso|pron}}) is a [[clown]] or [[jester]] in [[Comedia (Spanish play)|Spanish comedy]] of the [[16th century]]. Clarín, the clown in [[Pedro Calderón de la Barca]]'s ''[[Life is a dream]]'' is recognized as a gracioso.

[[Benjamin Ivry]] describes Gracioso as "scatological, sexual, anti-feminist, anti-Semitic, and a vehicle for wild, anti-heroic satire. A gross trickster with license to every obscenity, Gracioso could also be poignant, but mostly he burlesqued eroticism by declaring as identical hermaphrodites, homosexuals and eunuchs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Maurice Ravel: A Life|last=Ivry|first=Benjamin|publisher=Welcome Rain Publishers|year=2000|isbn=1-56649-152-5|location=New York, NY|pages=44}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Northrop Frye]] identified him as a type of [[tricky slave]].

''[[Alborada del gracioso]]'', the fourth movement of ''[[Miroirs]]'' (1904–05) by [[Maurice Ravel]], is a musical portrait of a ''gracioso.''

The '''Jabroudian culture''' is a cultural phase of the [[Middle Paleolithic]] of the [[Levant]]. It broadly belongs to the [[Mousterian]] culture, and shows connections with the European facies [[La Quina]].

One of the most noticeable elements is the so-called ''Amoudian'' elements, that are the first known [[stone blade]]s ever. Nevertheless the connection of this ''Amoudian'' innovations with later [[Upper Paleolithic]] blades is most likely null.

== Tools ==

The thick layers of Jabroudian consist mainly in heavy scratchers and hand axes. The proportion of the first type of tools tends to increase as time passes, while the axes show a decrease even totally disappearing in the upper layer of some Jabroudian sites.

=== ''Amoudian'' blades ===

A most interesting facet of Jabroudian culture are the so called ''Amoudian'' blade tools. This is the earliest known stone blade industry ever and it's always found inserted in Jabroudian sites, with both "cultures" being inseparable. As with the hand axes, the proportion of stone blades decreases with time, until it finally vanishes with the end of Yabrudian culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://web.ihep.su/library/pubs/tconf01/ps/c3-10.pdf |title=Chaos as the true source... |publisher=Web.ihep.su |date=  |author= |accessdate= January 19, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is a gap of c. 10,000 years between the end of this blade tradition and the appearance of [[Upper Paleolithic]] technology, based precisely on stone blades.

== Human remains ==

The only human remain associated with this culture is a skull found in the cave of Zuttiyeh, in the [[Galilee]] region of [[Israel]], that belongs to a [[Neanderthal]].

== Hunting ==

There is evidence that the Jabroudian people hunted a wide array of animals: [[elephant]]s, [[rhinoceros]], [[antelope]]s and small animals are all found in their sites.

== End of Jabroudian ==

The end of this culture is associated to the introduction of other (also Mousterian) cultural trends, of [[Levalloisian]] tradition, that were widely distributed through [[Western Asia|Western]] and [[Central Asia]].

{{Calendar}}
'''January''' is the first month of the year in the [[Julian calendar|Julian]] and [[Gregorian calendar]]s and the first of seven months to have a length of 31 days. The first day of the month is known as [[New Year's Day]]. It is, on average, the coldest month of the year within most of the [[Northern Hemisphere]] (where it is the second month of winter) and the warmest month of the year within most of the [[Southern Hemisphere]] (where it is the second month of summer). In the Southern hemisphere, January is the seasonal equivalent of July in the Northern hemisphere and vice versa.

[[Ancient Roman]] observances during this month include [[Cervula]], and [[Juvenalia]]; celebrated January 1, as well as one of three  [[Agonalia]], celebrated January 9, and [[Carmentalia]], celebrated January 11. These dates do not correspond to the modern Gregorian calendar.

==History==
[[File:Les Très Riches Heures du duc de Berry Janvier.jpg|thumb|January, from the ''[[Très Riches Heures du Duc de Berry]]'']]

January  (in Latin, ''[[Ianuarius]]'') is named after the [[Latin]] word for door (''ianua''), since January is the door to the year and an opening to new beginnings. The month is conventionally thought of as being named after [[Janus]], the god of beginnings and transitions in [[Roman mythology]], but according to ancient Roman farmers' almanacs [[Juno (mythology)|Juno]] was the [[tutelary deity]] of the month.&lt;ref&gt;[[H.H. Scullard]], ''Festivals and Ceremonies of the Roman Republic'' (Cornell University Press, 1981), p. 51.&lt;/ref&gt;

Traditionally, the original [[Roman calendar]] consisted of 10 months totaling 304 days, winter being considered a month-less period. Around 713 BC, the semi-mythical successor of [[Romulus]], King [[Numa Pompilius]], is supposed to have added the months of January and [[February]], so that the calendar covered a standard lunar year (354 days). Although [[March]] was originally the first month in the old Roman calendar, January became the first month of the calendar year either under Numa or under the [[Decemvirs]] about 450&amp;nbsp;BC (Roman writers differ). In contrast, each specific calendar year was identified by the names of the two [[consul]]s, who entered office on May 1{{citation needed|date=January 2016}} or March 15 until 153&amp;nbsp;BC, from when they entered office on January 1.

Various Christian feast dates were used for the [[New Year]] in [[Europe]] during the [[Middle Ages]], including March 25 ([[Feast of the Annunciation]]) and December 25. However, medieval calendars were still displayed in the Roman fashion with twelve columns from January to December. Beginning in the 16th century, European countries began officially making January 1 the start of the New Year once again—sometimes called ''Circumcision Style'' because this was the date of the [[Feast of the Circumcision]], being the seventh day after December 25.

Historical names for January include its original Roman designation, Ianuarius, the [[Saxon people|Saxon]] term ''Wulf-monath'' (meaning "wolf month") and [[Charlemagne]]'s designation Wintarmanoth ("winter / cold month"). In [[Slovene language|Slovene]], it is traditionally called ''prosinec''. The name, associated with [[millet]] bread and the act of asking for something, was first written in 1466 in the [[Škofja Loka]] manuscript.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.dlib.si/details/URN:NBN:SI:DOC-93FLIZJH/ |title=Ob petstoletnici škofjeloškega zapisa slovenskih imen za mesece |language=Slovenian |trans-title=On the 500th Anniversary of the Škofja Loka Recording of Slovene Month Names |first=Jože |last=Stabej |journal=Loški razgledi |year=1966 |volume=13 |publisher=Muzejsko društvo Škofja Loka [Museum Society of Škofja Loka] |issn=0459-8210 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140108042550/http://www.dlib.si/details/URN:NBN:SI:DOC-93FLIZJH |archivedate=2014-01-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Theodor Mommsen]],&lt;ref&gt;''The History of Rome'', volume 4, The Revolution, {{ISBN|1-4353-4597-5}}, page 4&lt;/ref&gt; 1 January became the first day of the year in 600 [[Ab urbe condita|AUC]] of the Roman calendar (153&amp;nbsp;BC), due to disasters in the [[Lusitanian War]]. A Lusitanian chief called Punicus invaded the Roman territory, defeated two Roman governors, and killed their troops. The Romans resolved to send a consul to [[Hispania]], and in order to accelerate the dispatch of aid, "they even made the new consuls enter into office two months and a half before the legal time" (March 15).

*The Japanese floral emblem of January is the [[camellia]] (''[[Camellia sinensis]]'').{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}}
*In Finnish, the month of ''tammikuu'' means the heart of the winter and because the name literally means "[[oak]] moon", it can be inferred that the oak tree is the heart of the grand forest with many valuable trees as opposed to the typical Arctic forests, which are typically pine and spruce. The photograph of a large tree covered with ice against a blue sky is a familiar scene during Finland's winter.
*The [[zodiac]] signs for the month of January are [[Capricorn (astrology)|Capricorn]] (until January 19) and [[Aquarius (astrology)|Aquarius]] (January 20 onwards).

'''Josef Frank''' (July 15, 1885 &amp;ndash; January 8, 1967) was an [[Austria]]n-born [[architect]], artist, and designer who adopted [[Sweden|Swedish]] citizenship in the latter half of his life. Together with [[Oskar Strnad]], he created the [[Wiener Schule der Architektur|Vienna School of Architecture]], and its concept of [[Modern architecture|Modern]] houses, [[House|housing]] and interiors.

== Life ==
Josef Frank was of Jewish ancestry.  His parents, merchant Ignaz (Isak) Frank (October 17, 1851 &amp;ndash; January 27, 1921 Vienna) and the Vienna-born Jenny (September 3, 1861&amp;ndash;10 February 1941 Vienna), were originally from [[Heves]] in [[Hungary]].  He designed his parents' grave in the old Jewish section of [[Zentralfriedhof|Vienna's Central Cemetery]] (Group 19, Row 58, Grave No.52).&lt;ref&gt;All information regarding parents from the article by George Gaugusch: ''Genealogy of the families Feilendorf and Frank'' in I. Meder (ed.): ''Joseph Frank 1885-1967 - Eine Moderne der Unordnung'', 2008 (in German)&lt;/ref&gt; He studied architecture at the [[Technical University of Vienna|Vienna University of Technology]].  He then taught at the [[Vienna School of Arts and Crafts]] from 1919 to 1925. He was a founding member of the [[Vienna Werkbund]], initiator and leader of the 1932 project [[Werkbundsiedlung Wien|Werkbundsiedlung in Vienna]]. In 1933, he [[Emigration|emigrated]] to Sweden, where he gained [[citizenship]] in 1939. He was the most prestigious [[designer]] in the Stockholm design company [[Svenskt Tenn]] (Swedish Pewter).  He remained in Sweden after 1945 despite attempts to return him to [[Vienna]]. The [[Vienna Circle]] manifesto lists three of his publications&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Josef Frank | title=Vom neuen Stil | journal=Baukunst | volume= | number= | pages= | year=1927 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Josef Frank | title=Der Gschnas fürs Gemüt und der Gschnas als Problem | location=Stuttgart | publisher=Akad. Verlag | year=1928 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | editor= | author=Josef Frank | contribution=Die Wiener Bautätigkeit 1928 und die Kunst | pages= | chapter= | title=Zeitfragen auf dem Gebiet der Soziologie | location=Leipzig | publisher= | year= 1929}}&lt;/ref&gt; in a bibliography of closely related authors. He was also the brother of the physicist, mathematician, and philosopher [[Philipp Frank]].

== Legacy ==
Josef Frank dealt early on with [[public housing]] and [[housing estate]]s. Contrary to most other architects of the interwar period in Vienna, he took the idea of settlement and not the creation of so-called super blocks in the municipal housing. He also rejected facade decor and clearly preferred [[Functionalism (architecture)|functional]] forms. The Viennese architect and [[furniture design]]er [[Luigi Blue]] refers to him as one of his idols.
In addition to his architectural work he created numerous designs for furniture, furnishings, fabrics, [[wallpaper]] and [[carpet]]. He has been a painter, as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hampel-auctions.com/de/archive-artists/f/403.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-08-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111003004411/http://www.hampel-auctions.com/de/archive-artists/f/403.html |archivedate=2011-10-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

An exhibition of his textile designs is to be held from January to May 2017, at the [[Fashion and Textile Museum]] in London.&lt;ref name="FTM2007"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ftmlondon.org/ftm-exhibitions/josef-frank-patterns-furniture-painting/|title=Josef Frank Patterns–Furniture–Painting|publisher=[[Fashion and Textile Museum]]|accessdate=5 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Siegal coached [[Israel at the World Baseball Classic#2017 tournament|Team Israel at the 2017 World Baseball Classic]] in March 2017.

== Early life ==
Siegal was born in [[Cleveland, Ohio]], and is Jewish.&lt;ref name=autogenerated7&gt;[http://www.jweekly.com/2015/11/13/oakland-as-make-justine-siegal-first-female-coach-in-mlb-history/ "Oakland As make Justine Siegal first female coach in MLB history,"&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] ''J''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cleveland.com/tribe/index.ssf/2015/07/life_for_justine_siegal_first.html "Life for Justine Siegal, first woman to throw batting practice to Major Leaguers, 'is about getting back up'" | cleveland.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;  Her grandfather and grandmother endowed the Cleveland College of Judaic Studies, now affiliated with [[Case Western Reserve University]] called the Laura and Alvin Siegal Lifelong Learning Program.&lt;ref name=autogenerated7 /&gt; Her grandfather also led the fundraising for [[Israel Bonds]] in Cleveland for a number of years.&lt;ref name=autogenerated7 /&gt;

Siegal grew up in [[Cleveland Heights]], a suburb of Cleveland.&lt;ref name=autogenerated9&gt;[http://m.mlb.com/news/article/16694130// "Justine Siegal becomes first woman to throw big league batting practice,"&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] MLB.com.&lt;/ref&gt; She was introduced to baseball at a very young age, as her grandfather Alvin Siegel frequently took her to [[Cleveland Indian]] baseball games.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated8&gt;[http://www.espn.com/boston/story/_/id/6941003/the-9-11-legacy-little-league-girl "The 9/11 legacy of a Little League girl,"&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] ESPN.&lt;/ref&gt; Her father, Michael, always signed her up for baseball, rather than for [[softball]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated9 /&gt; At 13, her baseball coach told her she didn't belong in baseball because she was a woman and baseball was a man's sport.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.malibutimes.com/malibu_life/article_240c5a08-e8dd-11e6-8689-2fa83bc1107a.html|title=Malibu’s Justine Siegal Steps Up to the Plate|last=Abel|first=Judy |work=Malibu Times|access-date=2017-03-13|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; She believed that this was wrong, and continued playing baseball despite people who discouraged her from playing baseball because it was a "man's sport". At age 16 she made it her goal to coach baseball at a collegiate level, despite being discouraged by others from playing and coaching baseball at this age as well.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://jewishbaseballmuseum.com/spotlight-story/breaking-barriers-justine-siegal-show-woman-can-career-coach-baseball/|title=Breaking barriers: Justine Siegal shows a woman can have career as coach in baseball|publisher= Jewish Baseball Museum|language=en-US|access-date=2016-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; She attended the [[Brewster Academy]] (where she played baseball for two years) and [[Hawken School|Hawken High School]] (her freshman and senior years).&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.patriotledger.com/x618628049/Justine-Siegal-joins-Brockton-Rox-coaching-staff "Justine Siegal joins Brockton Rox coaching staff" - The Patriot Ledger, Quincy, MA&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; In high school, she played third base and pitched.&lt;ref name=autogenerated9 /&gt;

==Academic background==
Siegal attended [[Beloit College]] and holds a [[B.A.]] from [[St. Olaf College]] with a concentration in "Leadership: Religion, Military, and Baseball", an [[M.A.]] in Sport Studies from [[Kent State University]], and a [[Ph.D.]] in [[Sport psychology|Sport and Exercise Psychology]] from [[Springfield College (Massachusetts)|Springfield College (MA)]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated8 /&gt; Her academic focus is in performance enhancement, sport management, coaching, gender equity, and youth sports.&lt;ref name=autogenerated6&gt;[http://m.mlb.com/news/article/152329548/justine-siegal-first-female-coach-in-majors/ "Justine Siegal first female coach in Majors,"&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] mlb.com.&lt;/ref&gt; Siegel knew the difficulties of trying to be a baseball coach, so she went on to pursue her Ph.D to equal the level of opportunities.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt;

==Center for the Study of Sport in Society==
Since 2011, Siegal is the Director of Sports Partnerships at the Center for the Study of Sport in Society at [[Northeastern University]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated4&gt;[http://www.northeastern.edu/sportinsociety/about-us/staff/justine-siegal/ Bio page], Northeastern University's Center for the Study of Sport in Society.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=WNCOCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA287&amp;dq=%22justine+siegal%22+baseball&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjPu9nx887SAhXBZCYKHdDKAmgQ6AEIggEwEg#v=onepage&amp;q=%22justine%20siegal%22%20baseball&amp;f=false ''Kicking Off: How Women in Sport Are Changing the Game'' - Sarah Shephard - Google Books&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated8 /&gt; As the Director she works towards expanding academic programs and relationships with Major League Baseball and other sports organizations.

==Coaching youth and college baseball==
In 2002, Siegal formed the Sparks, the first all-girl team to compete in a national "boys" baseball tournament. A [[documentary film]], "Girls of Summer" (not to be confused with the 1988 film of the same title), was made about the team.

Along with coaching youth baseball, Siegal was assistant coach for the Springfield College baseball team, the only woman coach in the collegiate baseball ranks in the years of 2008-10.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;{{Cite web|title = Justine Siegal|url = http://www.northeastern.edu/sportinsociety/about-us/staff/justine-siegal/|website = www.northeastern.edu|accessdate = 2015-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated6 /&gt;

In addition Siegal has been a coach and Technical Commissioner for the International Baseball Federation, where she has coached for the World Children’s Team USA. The team won the [[gold medal]] at the Women’s Baseball World Cup.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt;

==Coaching and pitching batting practice in men's professional baseball==
Siegal in 2009 became the first female coach of a professional men's baseball team, when she worked for the [[Brockton Rox]], in the independent [[Canadian American Association of Professional Baseball]], as the first-base coach.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=Ki5lxnI00QcC&amp;pg=PA5&amp;dq=%22justine+siegal%22+baseball&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjPu9nx887SAhXBZCYKHdDKAmgQ6AEITTAJ#v=onepage&amp;q=%22justine%20siegal%22%20baseball&amp;f=false ''Ten Difficult Women: Their Impact and Legacy'' - Karen Reed Hadalski - Google Books&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated5&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=23LbBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT121&amp;dq=%22justine+siegal%22+baseball&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjPu9nx887SAhXBZCYKHdDKAmgQ6AEIWTAL#v=onepage&amp;q=%22justine%20siegal%22%20baseball&amp;f=false ''Baseball: A Special Gift from God'' - Bryan Steverson - Google Books&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Baseball For All ==
Growing up being told that baseball is a sport for man, while softball is the sport for women, influenced her to start her own [[nonprofit organization]] called Baseball For All when she was 23 years old.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.malibutimes.com/news/article_97bf786a-261a-11e3-a20e-0019bb2963f4.html "Malibu Sports Spotlight: Justine Siegal" | malibutimes.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Siegal is the founder and executive director of Baseball for All, an organization that works toward gender equity in youth baseball by strongly encouraging and providing opportunities for girls to participate in baseball.&lt;ref name=autogenerated4 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Baseball For All|url = http://www.baseballforall.com/|website = Baseball For All|accessdate = 2015-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated6 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=DLgYDgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA215&amp;dq=%22justine+siegal%22+baseball&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjPu9nx887SAhXBZCYKHdDKAmgQ6AEIODAF#v=onepage&amp;q=%22justine%20siegal%22%20baseball&amp;f=false ''Making My Pitch: A Woman's Baseball Odyssey'' - Ila Jane Borders - Google Books&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Baseball For All encourages and provides equal opportunities for girls with the same passion for baseball to connect and foster that passion playing baseball. Through Baseball For All she is trying to get rid of the status quo of females being discouraged from playing baseball. Baseball For All encourages young girls to pursue their love for baseball, and educates the public on the importance of equal opportunities for men and women.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.baseballforall.com/about-ewdpu|title=Baseball For All|website=Baseball For All|access-date=2016-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; The programs works on giving girls the sources needed to participate in the sport whether it means becoming a player, coach, umpire, or filling other baseball roles in hopes that other communities will extend their baseball programs to girls.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2929">The '''Latin American and the Caribbean Economic System''', officially known as '''Sistema Económico Latinoamericano y del Caribe (SELA)''', is an organization founded in 1975 to promote [[economic]] cooperation and social development between [[Latin American]] and the [[Caribbean]] countries. In the early 1990s, its representatives consisted of members from 28 countries and took part in the [[General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade]] (GATT) negotiations, which led to a new global agreement on restrictions on trade and established the [[World Trade Organization]] (WTO).

The Latin American Council represents SELA's policy-making body and meets once a year. The main administrative body is the secretariat, located in [[Caracas, Venezuela]].

[[File:Latin American Economic System.png|thumb|Member nations in Yellow]]

==Objectives==
International relations scholar Sheldon Liss, in ''Diplomacy and Dependency: Venezuela, the United States, and the Americas'' (1978) described the initial objectives of SELA:
&lt;BLOCKQUOTE style="font-size:93%"&gt;
SELA, composed of twenty-five member states, and to which Venezuela contributes the largest share (17 per cent) of the budget, hopes to: restructure international commerce in basic commodities in order to raise developing states' export values, improve trade conditions, stimulate industrial development, control foreign-based transnational corporations, create Latin American multinational companies which will use to better advantage the human, technological, and financial resources of the area, sponsor organizations to process and market raw materials, improve the negotiating power of the member states, and plan joint economic strategies.

SELA members deem it likely that Venezuelan oil wealth will permit them easy access to petrodollars for use as finance capital. (pp 271, 2.)

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1869">'''Lexical field theory''', or ''word-field theory'', was introduced on March 12, 1931 by the German linguist [[Jost Trier]]. He argued that words acquired their meaning through their relationships to other words within the same word-field. An extension of the sense of one word narrows the meaning of neighboring words, with the words in a field fitting neatly together like a mosaic. If a single word undergoes a [[semantic change]], then the whole structure of the lexical field changes. The lexical field is often used in English to describe terms further with use of different words.
 
Trier's theory assumes that lexical fields are easily definable [[closed sets]],&lt;ref&gt;David Kronenfeld and Gabriella Rundblad in Regine Eckardt, Klaus von Heusinger, Christoph Schwarze, ''Words in Time'', Walter de Gruyter, 2003, p68. {{ISBN|3-11-017675-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; with no overlapping meanings or gaps. These assumptions have been questioned and the theory has been modified since its original formulation.&lt;ref&gt;Richard M. Hogg, Norman Francis Blake, R. W. Burchfield, Suzanne Romaine, Roger Lass, John Algeo, ''The Cambridge History of the English Language: The beginnings to 1066'', Cambridge University Press, 1992, p403. {{ISBN|0-521-26474-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous''''' is an American [[television series]] that aired in [[Broadcast syndication|syndication]] from [[1984 in television|1984]] to [[1995 in television|1995]].&lt;ref name=NYT&gt;{{cite web|work=[[The New York Times]]|title=TELEVISION; Now, a Look at the Life Style of Robin Leach|author=Collins, Glenn|date=December 2, 1990|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1990/12/02/arts/television-now-a-look-at-the-life-style-of-robin-leach.html?pagewanted=all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The show featured the extravagant lifestyles of wealthy [[entertainer]]s, [[sportsperson|athlete]]s and business [[Business magnate|mogul]]s.

It was hosted by [[Robin Leach]] for the majority of its run.&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt; When Leach was joined by [[Shari Belafonte]] in 1994, the show was renamed '''''Lifestyles with Robin Leach and Shari Belafonte.''''' Leach ended each episode with a wish for his viewers that became his signature [[catchphrase]], "champagne wishes and caviar dreams."

The theme song, titled "Come With Me Now" and performed by [[Bill Conti]], is from a 1979 film called ''[[Five Days from Home]].''

==Synopsis==
''Lifestyles'' was one of the first shows to feature the lives of the wealthy. Later shows such as VH1's ''[[The Fabulous Life Of]]...'' continued this trend. The show was largely intended to be an insight into the opulent residences and the glamorous lifestyles of those it profiled. However, many of the geographic areas it covered were ideal destinations for vacations, and in his on-camera appearances, Leach indirectly made references to resorts and tourist attractions. David Greenspan (aka David Perry), who was the voice-over narrator for most of the segments during the bulk of the show's run and could be heard whenever Leach did not appear on camera, made more direct references to such resorts and such tourist attractions during his tenure as the show's voice-over narrator.

''Lifestyles'' was created by [[Al Masini|Alfred M. "Al" Masini]], who had also created ''[[Solid Gold (TV series)|Solid Gold]],'' ''[[Entertainment Tonight]],'' and ''[[Star Search]];'' all of these were part of his [[Operation Prime Time]] project, which he later renamed Television Program Enterprises and later merged with [[Rysher Entertainment]] to form Rysher TPE, though ''Solid Gold'' or ''Entertainment Tonight'' were never syndicated by TPE or Rysher but all 4 are now owned by [[CBS Television Distribution]].

==Spinoff==
''Lifestyles'' had two companion spinoff series, ''Runaway with the Rich and Famous'', also hosted by Leach.  The series also aired in first-run syndication, from 1986 to 1994.  There was also ''[[Fame, Fortune and Romance]]'' broadcast on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] from 1986 to 1987.

The '''Marjorie Barrick Museum of Art''' (MSM; formerly known as the '''Marjorie Barrick Museum of Natural History''') is a [[museum]] located on the main campus of the [[University of Nevada, Las Vegas]] (UNLV), established in 1967.&lt;ref&gt;AASLH (2002, p.506); Danilov (2005, p.205)&lt;/ref&gt;  The museum was originally instituted as a [[natural history]] museum with a focus on the [[Environment of Nevada|natural history and environment of Nevada]] and the broader [[Southwestern United States]].&lt;ref&gt;Taylor (2008)&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2011, the Barrick joined the UNLV College of Fine Arts and became the anchor of the Galleries at UNLV. The six galleries and one museum that make up the Galleries are each entities in their own right linked via a common administration. The Marjorie Barrick Museum (the Barrick), is a well-known venue for engaging exhibitions and events and promotes engagement with the visual arts among a broad community including UNLV students, faculty, and staff; the greater Las Vegas community; and the national and international art community.

==History==

The founding of a natural history museum at the university—then an institution only a decade old, known as Nevada Southern University&lt;ref&gt;The university was officially founded in 1957 as the Southern Division of the University of Nevada. The university's name was formally changed to UNLV in 1969.&lt;/ref&gt;—began with a collection of specimens from the [[Desert Research Institute]] (DRI), the [[Nevada System of Higher Education]]'s graduate [[research institute]]. In September 1967, the DRI opened a small museum facility in premises across from the university's grounds, as part of an expansion of DRI's activities into southern Nevada. The museum was created under the direction of archaeologist [[Richard H. Brooks]], assistant research professor at the university and a researcher (later director) of the DRI-affiliated Nevada Archaeological Survey. Its exhibits consisted of DRI's local collection of living desert animal specimens and Native American artifacts.&lt;ref&gt;Mikkelsen (2001); Slaughter (2007, p.2)&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1969 the university took over the management of the museum from DRI.&lt;ref name="Mikkelsen 2001"&gt;Mikkelsen (2001)&lt;/ref&gt; Brooks remained as director of the university-affiliated museum, and during his tenure, the museum's funding was established and further permanent exhibits acquired.&lt;ref name="Slaughter 2007, p.2"&gt;Slaughter (2007, p.2)&lt;/ref&gt; The most significant acquisition occurred in 1979, when a private collection of [[pre-Columbian art]] was donated by a former UNLV [[alumna]], Mannetta Braunstein, and her husband Michael. These pieces would form the basis of a broadening collection of Mesoamerican and [[Aridoamerica]]n cultural artifacts, acquired through other donations and further additions from the Braunsteins' purchases in Latin American markets.&lt;ref&gt;UNLV Foundation (n.d.)&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 1970s, the museum began the process of relocating to premises situated on the UNLV campus, to occupy a building that had contained the university's original gymnasium. Renovations to accommodate the museum were completed in 1981. Further alterations and expansions to the building were subsequently undertaken, and a research laboratory wing was added in 1994.&lt;ref name="Mikkelsen 2001"/&gt;

Beginning in 1979 the museum's anthropological collections were greatly expanded, with the subsequent additions of donated collections of [[ethnography|ethnographic]] and [[archaeology|archaeological]] artifacts representing  [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] and [[pre-Columbian]] [[Mesoamerica]]n cultures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |year=n.d. |title=Cultural Collections |url=http://barrickmuseum.unlv.edu/collections/ |work=Collections |publisher=Marjorie Barrick Museum |accessdate=2009-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Brooks left the position in 1981.&lt;ref name="Slaughter 2007, p.2"/&gt; His successor as museum director was [[ornithologist]] and former UNLV president (1973–78) [[Donald Baepler]],  who was returning to the university campus after a three-year term as chancellor of the [[Nevada System of Higher Education|Nevada university system]].&lt;ref&gt;Moehring (2007, p.92); Mower &amp; Wills (2008)&lt;/ref&gt; Baepler was instrumental in establishing UNLV's Harry Reid Environmental Research Center, and the museum was reorganized to become one of the center's operating divisions. Baepler retired as museum director in 2004, retained a title as [[emeritus]] executive director of the museum.&lt;ref&gt;Mower &amp; Wills (2008)&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1989 the museum was renamed in honor of [[Marjorie Barrick]], a longstanding benefactor of the university.&lt;ref&gt;Moehring (2007, p.89); Mower (2007)&lt;/ref&gt; In 1980 Barrick, a prominent [[philanthropist]] married to a Las Vegas real estate developer, had gifted UNLV with an endowment of some $1.2million from her late husband's estate, to fund an ongoing series of public lectures at the university. Speakers at the Barrick Lecture Series have included international figures and heads of state, such as [[Jimmy Carter]], [[Gerald Ford]], [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] and [[F. W. de Klerk]].&lt;ref&gt;Danilov (2005, p.205); Moehring (2007, pp.99,129); Mower (2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, the Barrick closed its doors to undergo a change of hands with departments as well as begin remodeling of the museum. The Marjorie Barrick ceased to be affiliated with the Harry Reid Center and Department of Archaeology and is now a part of the College of Fine Arts at UNLV. The entire museum underwent drastic renovations, from its Collections Room&lt;ref&gt;https://barrickmuseum.wordpress.com/2012/02/10/theres-something-going-on-at-the-barrick/&lt;/ref&gt; to the Exhibition Hall, which changed how the public is able to interact with the space from piece to piece.

After the [[Las Vegas Art Museum]] (or LVAM) closed its doors in 2009, their collection was left without a home. In 2012 the LVAM collection moved to the newly renovated Barrick Museum, as part of a partnership between LVAM and UNLV.&lt;ref name="unlv.edu"&gt;https://www.unlv.edu/barrickmuseum/collections&lt;/ref&gt;

==Collections==
The Collections at the Marjorie Barrick Museum include:
*'''The Barrick Art Collection'''
–The Barrick Museum is committed to collecting art of the present. This commitment is supported entirely through the generosity of artists and collectors who donate in-kind gifts of art. The bulk of the works in the collection include artists with ties to the greater Las Vegas valley forming a heritage collection of works created in and inspired by the Southern Nevada region.&lt;ref name="unlv.edu"/&gt;
*'''The Barrick Cultural Collection'''
–The cultural collection began to form in 1969 and includes cultural objects from the American Southwest and Mesoamerica. The Pre-Columbian collection was initiated in 1979 with a gift from Dr. Michael C. and Mannetta Braunstein. Today, the museum's holdings include the Dr. Michael C. and Mannetta Braunstein Collection, a comprehensive collection of Pre-Columbian objects from nearly every culture of Pre-Columbian Latin America, as well as Mexican dance masks and retablos; Guatemalan, Bolivian, and Navajo textiles; Paiute and Hopi basketry; and Navajo jewelry. A variety of methodologies have been used at different times to collect, classify, analyze, and describe collection material, and the collections provide rich primary source information for multi-, cross-, and interdisciplinary studies. The Museum is compliant with guidelines mandates by the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act (NAGPRA).&lt;ref name="unlv.edu"/&gt;
*'''The LVAM Collection'''
–Works in the collection include national and international artists such as Llyn Foulkes and William T. Wiley, as well as a significant representation of UNLV graduates.&lt;ref name="unlv.edu"/&gt;
*'''The Vogel Collection'''
–The Barrick Museum houses the Dorothy and Herbert Vogel 50x50 Collection. In 2010, UNLV was the recipient of 50 contemporary works from the celebrated collectors. Beginning in 1962, New York postal clerk, Herbert Vogel, and his librarian wife, Dorothy, began collecting contemporary works of art. The couple dedicated all of Herb's salary to buying art, and in a few decades had amassed a collection encompassing some 4,000 works. Today, these works form one of the most remarkable collections of contemporary art in America. Motivated by the desire to share their collection with the public, the couple developed a program to gift 50 works to one institution in each of the 50 states. This program became known as Vogel 50x50. The collection includes the work by such notables as Stephen Antonakos, Neil Jenney, Lynda Benglis, Lucio Pozzi, Edda Renouf, Bettina Werner and Richard Tuttle.&lt;ref name="unlv.edu"/&gt;

A '''metate''' or '''metlatl''' (or '''mealing stone''') is a type or variety of [[Quern-stone#Saddle_quern|quern]], a [[ground stone]] tool used for processing [[grain]] and [[seed]]s. In traditional [[Mesoamerica]]n culture, metates were typically used by women who would grind [[nixtamalization|lime-treated]] [[maize]] and other organic materials during food preparation (e.g., making [[tortilla]]s). Similar artifacts are found all over the world,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.reference-wordsmith.com/cgi-bin/lookup.cgi?exact=1&amp;terms=ding {{dead link|date=January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; including China.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://carleton.ca/~bgordon/Rice/papers/sung_nd.htm|title=Discussion on the Origins of Grinding Tools, Mortar and Pestle|author=|date=|website=carleton.ca|accessdate=23 March 2018|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050407130949/http://www.carleton.ca/~bgordon/Rice/papers/sung_nd.htm|archivedate=7 April 2005|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Formation and morphology==
While varying in specific morphology, metates adhere to a common shape.  They typically consist of large stones with a smooth depression or bowl worn into the upper surface. The bowl is formed by the continual and long-term grinding of materials using a smooth hand-held stone (known as a ''[[mano (stone)|mano]]'').  This action consists of a [[Horizontal plane|horizontal]] grinding motion that differs from the [[vertical direction|vertical]] crushing motion used in a [[mortar and pestle]].  The depth of the bowl varies, though they are typically not deeper than those of a mortar; deeper metate bowls indicate either a longer period of use or greater degree of activity (i.e., economic specialization). The specific angles of the metate body allow for a proficient method of turning grains into flour.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Cuisine and Empire|last=Laudan|first=Rachel|publisher=University of California Press|year=2013|isbn=978-0-520-26645-2|location=|pages=32}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another type of metate called a [[grinding slab]] may also be found among [[boulder]] or exposed [[bedrock]] outcroppings.  The upper face of the stone is used for grinding materials, such as [[acorn]]s, that results in the smoothing of the stone's face and the creation of pocked dimples (see image).

==Ceremonial metates of Costa Rica==
[[Image:Metate-BMA.jpg|thumb|A Costa Rican metate with bird iconography at the [[Birmingham Museum of Art]].]]

Carved, [[volcanic rock|volcanic-stone]] '''ceremonial metates''' represent one of the most unusual and complex traditions of [[pre-Columbian]] [[Artifact (archaeology)|artifact]]s from [[Costa Rica]]. They come in many different forms, and morphological variation corresponds to different regions and time periods. They can be [[rectangular]], [[circle|circular]], flat, or curved.  They may or may not have rims and between three and four legs.  Some exhibits show signs of use-wear while others show no signs of wear and appear to have been made specifically for use as [[grave goods|burial goods]]. Some examples characterized as metate might have actually been a type of throne for sitting on – not a metate at all.

Some examples are known as [[effigy]]-headed metate, which feature an [[animal]]’s head at one end, with the metate itself making up the body of the creature. Animals typically depicted are [[jaguar]], [[crocodile]] or [[bird]]s. The most complex type of ceremonial metate is the class referred to as “flying-panel” metate. This style comes from the [[geography of Costa Rica|Atlantic watershed]] region, including the City of [[Guayabo]] and represents a high level of craftsmanship and complexity. Carved from a single piece of stone, these metates typically contain multiple figures, both underneath the plate and on the legs. Trophy heads, birds, jaguar, monkey and [[saurian]] figures are the most common themes. The “flying panel” metate is believed to be the precursor to free standing sculptural figures more common later in the Atlantic watershed region.

===Temporal and regional variation===
[[Image:Metate-NPS.jpg|thumb|upright|Metate and mano]]
The earliest traditions of [[stone sculpture]] in Costa Rica, including ceremonial metate, began in late Period IV (A.D. 1–500). Metate from the Nicoya/Guanacaste region have longitudinally curved and rimless plates. Those from the Atlantic Watershed have a plate that is horizontally flat and rimmed. Both are associated with [[Grave goods|mortuary goods]], suggesting differential social status existed within these communities. The three main types of Costa Rican stone sculpture at this time—tripod-metate, mace heads and [[Costa Rican jade tradition|jade]] “axe-god” pendants—peaked and declined in use during Period V (A.D. 500–1000).

Stone sculpture was never popular again in the Nicoya/Guanacaste region, but in the Atlantic Watershed (such as from [[Guayabo]]) by Period VI (A.D. 1000–1500), freestanding figural sculpture and new forms of ceremonial metate came into use. These new metate types might be rectangular with four legs like the jaguar effigy-head examples or might be round in shape with a pedestal base. These latter types often have carved human heads (or just suggestive notches) around the rim implying a relationship with ritual trophy-head taking. This particular form of metate seems to have been influenced by the stone sculptures of the Panamanian site of [[Barriles]].

At the site of Las Huacas, fifteen metates were excavated from sixteen graves. None of these metates had [[Mano (stone)|mano]]s ([[grinding stones]]), suggesting that the carved metate as a mortuary object had a deeper [[symbolic meaning]] than just the processing of foodstuffs. The metate’s basic mechanical purpose is a platform on which (primarily) [[maize]] is ground into flour. This transformation of grain to flour has symbolic implications relating to life, death and rebirth. It is still not clear if maize was a main source of sustenance, and it is entirely possible that maize was reserved for making [[chicha]] (beer), for use in ritual feasting activities. Given their role as a burial good, it seems that metate held a strong meaning for human life, death and the hope for a rebirth or transformation of some kind.

===Iconography===
The three most popular iconographic elements of ceremonial metate seem to be [[saurian]], bird, and jaguar creatures. Monkeys are also common. A unique feature of ceremonial metate is the lack of human figures. Disembodied heads are the sole exception. While human figures become the main subject of the free standing sculptures, which depict nude females or male warriors with trophy heads and bound male captives, these do not seem to have been depicted on metate. Flying-panel metates often have anthropomorphic figures, but these always have animal (often crocodile) heads.

In both the Nicoya and Atlantic-Watershed regions, metates are often made with saurian (specifically crocodile, alligator, or caiman) imagery. It is thought that the saurian represents the surface of the earth, which relates to agricultural fertility.&lt;ref&gt;Graham 1981:119.&lt;/ref&gt; One of the oldest and most prominent themes in Chibcha art is that of the Crocodile god. Depicted as an anthropomorphic being with a crocodile head, he has been carved into fly-panel metates, sometimes shown standing on a double-headed saurian and other times on a jaguar. As a symbol, the double-headed Saurian has the longest use and distribution of any iconographic element in the Isthmo-Columbian area.

Costa Rica flying-panel metates date to the 1st and 7th centuries. However, certain features of the Crocodile god depicted on flying-panel metates show him with unnatural U-shaped elbows and long, narrow fingers, as seen on crocodile gods made in gold that date to the 10th–16th centuries. These stylistic forms make sense for use in the small gold ornaments made with the lost-wax technique, but seem strange for use in carved stone. Perhaps these metates date much later than previously thought, and were inspired by the depictions in gold.&lt;ref&gt;Quilter and Hoopes 2003:73-75.&lt;/ref&gt;

Birds with long, curving beaks that seem to represent vultures, toucans or maybe hummingbirds are another popular theme. First found in Costa Rica on Pavas and El Bosque-phase pottery, these are a common element in flying-panel metates, sometimes depicted with or pecking at human heads.

'''''Music Theory Spectrum''''' ({{ISSN|0195-6167}}) is a peer-reviewed, [[academic journal]] specializing in [[music theory]] and [[musical analysis|analysis]]. It is the official journal of the [[Society for Music Theory]], and is published by [[Oxford University Press]]. The journal was first published in 1979 as the official organ of the Society for Music Theory, which had been founded in 1977 and had its first conference in 1978.&lt;ref name="berry"&gt;{{citation|first=David Carson|last=Berry|authorlink=David Carson Berry|title=Schenkerian Theory in the United States: A Review of Its Establishment and a Survey of Current Research Topics|journal=Zeitschrift der Gesellschaft für Musiktheorie|volume=2|issue=2–3|year=2005|pages=111–112|url=http://www.gmth.de/zeitschrift/artikel/206.aspx}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike many other journals (music or otherwise), ''Music Theory Spectrum'' was initially published in an oblong (landscape) [[Page orientation|page format]], to better accommodate such musical graphics as [[Schenkerian analysis|Schenkerian]] graphs.&lt;ref name="berry"/&gt;

Published twice annually, ''Music Theory Spectrum'' includes research articles and book reviews. Online access to back issues of the journal is provided through [[JSTOR]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/journals/01956167.html JSTOR: Music Theory Spectrum].&lt;/ref&gt; In a 1999 study, it was the seventh most frequently cited journal in music theses overall, and the third most frequently cited journal in music theory theses.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first=Lois|last=Kuyper-Rushing|title=Identifying Uniform Core Journal Titles for Music Libraries: A Dissertation Citation Study|year=1999|url=http://www.ala.org/ala/mgrps/divs/acrl/publications/crljournal/1999/mar/kuyper.pdf|journal=College &amp; Research Libraries Journal|volume=60|issue=2|pages=153–163|doi=10.5860/crl.60.2.153}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Mycenaean chamber tomb''' is the type of [[chamber tomb]] that was built by ancient [[Mycenaeans]]. This form of mortuary architecture was in use in the Late [[Bronze Age]] in the areas under the cultural influence of the [[Aegean civilization|Aegean]].  

The tombs are cut from rock and have a tripartite structure (chamber, ''stomion'' and ''dromos''), often with additional niches and side chambers in which primary or secondary burials took place. Extensive cemeteries have been found in every part of Greece having [[Mycenae]]an influences, including the islands. Such tombs were also built in parts of ancient [[Anatolia]]. For about 500 years from 1600 BC to 1100 BC they were the most widespread of mortuary structures.

The '''Palatine Hill''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|p|æ|l|ə|t|aɪ|n}}; {{lang-la|Collis Palatium or Mons Palatinus}}&lt;!--not a typo, the Latin word has no 'n'--&gt;; {{lang-it|Palatino}} {{IPA-it|palaˈtiːno|}}) is the centremost of the [[Seven Hills of Rome]] and is one of the most ancient parts of the city. It stands 40 metres&lt;ref&gt;Palatine Hill. (2007). In Encyclopædia Britannica.  Retrieved August 25, 2007, from Encyclopædia Britannica Online: [http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9058062 britannica.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071109233344/http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9058062 |date=2007-11-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt; above the [[Roman Forum]], looking down upon it on one side, and upon the [[Circus Maximus]] on the other. From the time of [[Augustus]] Imperial palaces were built here.

The hill is the [[etymology|etymological]] origin of the word ''[[palace]]'' and its cognates in other languages ({{lang-it|palazzo}}, {{lang-fr|palais}}, [[Spanish language|Spanish]]: ''palacio,'' [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]]: ''palácio,'' {{lang-de|Palast}}, {{lang-cs|palác}}, etc.).{{Efn|The different spellings originate from the different languages that used the title throughout the ages (a phenomenon called [[lenition]]).}}&lt;!--Sentence moved from below to {{efn}}--&gt;

==Derivative terms==
&lt;!--This section is overly lengthy, and the bulk really belongs to [[palace:etymology]]--&gt;

The term ''[[palace]]'', from Old French ''palais'' or ''paleis'', stems ultimately from the proper name of Palatine Hill.&lt;ref name="OED-palace"&gt;"Palace". From the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]''&lt;/ref&gt; 

The Palatine Hill is also the [[etymology|etymological]] origin (via the Latin adjective ''{{linktext|palatinus}}'') of "[[palatine]]", a 16th century English adjective that originally signified something pertaining to the Caesar's palace, or someone who is invested with the king's authority. Later its use shifted to a reference to the [[German Palatinate]].&lt;ref name="OED"&gt;"Palatine". From the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--(login required url:) http://dictionary.oed.com.dax.lib.unf.edu/cgi/entry/50169581?query_type=word&amp;queryword=palatine--&gt; The office of the German [[count palatine]] (''Pfalzgraf'') had its origins in the ''comes palatinus'', an earlier office in [[Merovingian]] and [[Carolingian]] times.&lt;ref name=keller-medieval-france-ency&gt;{{cite book|last=Stowe |first=George B. |title=Palatinates |editor-last1=Kibler |editor-first1=William |editor-last2=Zinn |editor-first2=Grover A. |work=Medieval France: An Encyclopedia |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XkQrDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA576 |publisher=Garland |year=1995 |page=576 |isbn=9780824044442}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another modern English word "{{linktext|paladin}}", came into usage to refer to any distinguished knight (especially one of the [[Twelve Peers of Charlemagne]]) under Charlemagne in late renditions of [[Matter of France]].{{Efn|This word came into use after an obsolete English "palasin" (from OF ''palaisin'') came into disuse.}}&lt;ref&gt;"Paladin". From the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--(login required url:) http://dictionary.oed.com.dax.lib.unf.edu/cgi/entry/50169459?single=1&amp;query_type=word&amp;queryword=paladin Retrieved November 19, 2008.--&gt;

== Etymology ==
According to [[Livy]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.02.0026&amp;layout=&amp;loc=1.5 Livy 1.5.1].&lt;/ref&gt; (59 BC &amp;ndash; AD 17) the Palatine hill got its name from the [[Arcadia]]n settlement of [[Pallantium]]. More likely, it is derived from the noun ''palātum'' "palate"; [[Ennius]] uses it once for the "heaven", and it may be connected with the [[Etruscan language|Etruscan]] word for sky, ''falad''.&lt;ref&gt;Ernout and Meillet, ''Dictionnaire étymologique de la langue latine'', s.v. ''palātum''.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mythology==
According to [[Roman mythology]], the Palatine Hill was the location of the cave, known as the [[Lupercal]], where [[Romulus and Remus]] were found by the [[She-wolf (Roman mythology)|she-wolf]] Lupa that kept them alive.

Another legend occurring on the Palatine is [[Hercules]]' defeat of [[Cacus]] after the monster had stolen some cattle.  Hercules struck Cacus with his characteristic club so hard that it formed a cleft on the southeast corner of the hill, where later a staircase bearing the name of Cacus was constructed.&lt;ref&gt;CACUS: Giant of the Land of Latium". theoi.com.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Rome has its origins on the Palatine. Excavations show that people have lived in the area since the 10th century BC. {{citation needed|date=June 2016}}  Excavations performed on the hill in 1907 and again in 1948 unearthed a collection of huts believed to have been used for funerary purposes between the 9th and 7th century BC approximating the time period when the city of Rome was founded. &lt;ref&gt;https://www.world-archaeology.com/great-discoveries/palatine-hill/[[World Archeology 03MAR2011]]&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Livy]], after the immigration of the [[Sabines]] and the [[Alba Longa|Albans]] to Rome, the original Romans lived on the Palatine.&lt;ref&gt;[[Livy]], ''[[Ab Urbe Condita Libri (Livy)|Ab urbe condita]]'', 1:33&lt;/ref&gt; The Palatine Hill was also the site of the ancient festival of the [[Lupercalia]].

Many affluent Romans of the [[Roman Republic|Republican period]] (c.509 BC &amp;ndash; 44 BC) had their residences there.

From the start of the [[Roman Empire|Empire]] (27 BC) [[Augustus]] built his [[House of Augustus|palace]] there and the hill gradually became the exclusive domain of emperors; the ruins of the palaces of at least [[Augustus]] (27 BC  &amp;ndash; 14 AD), [[Tiberius]] (14 &amp;ndash; 37 AD) and [[Domitian]] (81 &amp;ndash; 96 AD) can still be seen.

Augustus also built a [[Temple of Apollo Palatinus|temple to Apollo]] here.

The great fire of 64 AD destroyed Nero's palace, but he replaced it by 69 AD with the even larger [[Domus Aurea]] over which was built Domitian's Palace &lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=xtoVDAAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Rome, An Oxford Archaeological Guide], A. Claridge, 1998 {{ISBN|0-19-288003-9}}, p. 120&lt;/ref&gt;

==Monuments==
The Palatine Hill is an archaeological site open to the public (requires payment).

The [[Palace of Domitian]] which dominates the site and looks out over the Circus Maximus was rebuilt largely during the reign of [[Domitian]] over earlier buildings of [[Nero]].

Later emperors particularly the [[Severan Dynasty|Severans]] made significant additions to the buildings.

===Houses of Livia and Augustus===
{{main|House of Augustus}}
[[File:Domus-livia-palatine-plan.png|thumb|plan of Domus Livia]]
The House of [[Livia]], the wife of Augustus, is conventionally attributed to her based only on the generic name on a clay pipe and circumstantial factors such as proximity to the House of Augustus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.historvius.com/the-house-of-livia-729/|title=The House of Livia  - Rome, Italy - History and Visitor Information|author=|date=|website=www.historvius.com|accessdate=5 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The building is located near the [[Temple of Cybele (Palatine)|Temple of Magna Mater]] at the western end of the hill, on a lower terrace from the temple. It is notable for its beautiful frescoes.

==Excavations==
During Augustus' reign, an area of the Palatine Hill was roped off for a sort of [[archaeology|archaeological]] expedition, which found fragments of [[Bronze Age]] pots and tools. He declared this site the "original town of Rome." [[Modern archaeology]] has identified evidence of Bronze Age settlement in the area which predates Rome's founding. There is a museum on the Palatine in which artifacts dating from before the official foundation of the City are displayed. The museum also contains Roman statuary.

An [[Si deus si dea#Altar to the Unknown Divinity|altar to an unknown deity]], once thought to be [[Aius Locutius]], was discovered here in 1820.

In July 2006, [[archaeologist]]s announced the discovery of the '''Palatine House''', which they believe to be the birthplace of [[Ancient Rome|Rome]]'s first Emperor, [[Augustus]].&lt;ref&gt;For a classical account of the birth (and birthplace) of Augustus, refer to: [[Suetonius]], ''[[Lives of the Twelve Caesars#Life of Augustus|Life of Augustus]]'', 5.&lt;/ref&gt; Head archaeologist [[Clementina Panella]] uncovered a section of corridor and other fragments under Rome's Palatine Hill, which she described on July 20 as "a very ancient aristocratic house." The two story house appears to have been built around an [[Atrium (architecture)|atrium]], with frescoed walls and mosaic flooring, and is situated on the slope of the Palatine that overlooks the [[Colosseum]] and the [[Arch of Constantine]]. The Republican-era houses on the Palatine were overbuilt by later palaces after the [[Great Fire of Rome]] (64), but apparently this one was not; the tempting early inference is that it was preserved for a specific and important reason. On the ground floor, three shops opened onto the [[Via Sacra]].

The location of the ''domus'' is important because of its potential proximity to the ''Curiae Veteres'', the earliest shrine of the ''[[Curia|curies]]'' of Rome.&lt;ref&gt;[[Varro]] ''Linguae Latinae'' 5.155; [[Sextus Pompeius Festus|Festus]] L 174; [[Tacitus]] ''Annales'' 12.24&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Lupercal grotto.jpg|thumb|270px|The photo of the excavated cave beneath the ''Domus Livia'' on the Palatine Hill, believed to be the [[Lupercal]]. The photo was taken with a remote sensing device.]]

In January 2007, Italian archeologist [[Irene Iacopi]] announced that she had probably found the legendary [[Lupercal]] cave beneath the remains of [[House of Augustus|Augustus' residence]], the ''Domus Livia'' (House of [[Livia]]) on the Palatine. Archaeologists came across the 16-metre-deep cavity while working to restore the decaying palace. The first photos of the cave show a richly decorated vault encrusted with mosaics and seashells. The Lupercal was probably converted to a sanctuary by Romans in later centuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2007/01/070126-rome-palatine.html|title=Sacred Cave of Rome's Founders Found, Scientists Say|author=|date=|website=news.nationalgeographic.com|accessdate=5 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2007 archaeologists unveiled photographs of the cave. Partially collapsed and decorated with seashells and colored marble, the vaulted sanctuary is buried 16 metres inside the Palatine hill. A white eagle was found atop the sanctuary's vault. Most of the sanctuary is collapsed or filled with earth, but laser scans allowed experts to estimate that the circular structure has a height of 8 metres and a diameter of 7.3 metres.

They concluded that the grotto is actually a ''[[nymphaeum]]'' or underground ''[[triclinium]]'' from [[Nero]]nian times.

'''Paraloid B-72''' or '''B-72''' is a [[thermoplastic]] resin that was created by [[Rohm and Haas]] for use as a surface coating and as a vehicle for [[flexographic ink]]. Today B-72 is commonly being used as an adhesive by [[conservator-restorer]]s, specifically in the [[conservation and restoration of ceramic objects]] and [[conservation and restoration of glass objects|glass objects]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://cameo.mfa.org/wiki/Paraloid_B-72] Paraloid B-72: Museum of Fine Arts Boston: Material Database&lt;/ref&gt; and can also be used for labelling museum objects.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nps.gov/museum/publications/conserveogram/01-04.pdf|title=Use Of Acryloid B-72 Lacquer For Labelling Museum Objects|last=|first=|date=|website=https://www.nps.gov/|publisher=|access-date=2017-01-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Uses==
[[File:Paraloid b72.jpg||250px|left|thumb|Paraloid B-72 in pellet form]]
B-72 is a durable and non-yellowing acrylic resin, which can be described chemically as an ethyl-methacrylate copolymer. It is soluble in [[acetone]], [[ethanol]], [[toluene]], and [[xylene]]s, among other solvents and solvent mixtures.&lt;ref&gt;Phenix, A. 1992. Solvents for Paraloid B-72. Conservation News 48:21–3.&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the major advantages of B-72 as a consolidant is that it is stronger and harder than [[polyvinyl acetate]] without being extremely brittle. This adhesive is more flexible than many of the other typically used adhesives and tolerates more stress and strain on a join than most others. The major drawbacks to using B-72 are related to its handling properties: as in the case of other acrylic resins it is difficult to apply as an adhesive and to manipulate with precision.&lt;ref name=Koob&gt;{{cite journal|last=Koob|first=Stephen|title=The Use of Paraloid B-72 as an adhesive. Its application for archaeological ceramics and other materials|journal=Studies in Conservation|date=30 April 1986|volume=31|pages=7–14|doi=10.1179/sic.1986.31.1.7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most suitable solvent for B-72 is acetone. However, solvent mixtures with various proportions of acetone, ethanol, and toluene are frequently used to alter the working time of the resin and to produce slightly different properties (hardness and flexibility, e.g.) in the set resin. Unlike [[cellulose nitrate]], B-72 does not need additives like [[plasticizer]]s to stabilize its durability. Fumed [[colloidal silica]] can be added to help with the workability of the resin. Research shows that the silica better distributes the stress and strain that occurs during evaporation of a solvent and during the setting of the adhesive film.&lt;ref name="Koob"/&gt;{{rp|p.9}}

Because of its transparency and versatility, conservators, led by Stephen Koob of the [[Corning Museum of Glass]], have recently begun to use cast sheets of B-72 as a fill material in glass objects.&lt;ref name=Corning&gt;{{cite journal|last=von Giffen|first=Astrid|title=Filling losses with Paraloid B-72.|url=http://www.cmog.org/blog/2011/11/01/filling-losses-with-paraloid-b-72/|publisher=Corning Museum of Glass|accessdate=22 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Reduplication''' in [[linguistics]] is a [[Morphology (linguistics)|morphological]] process in which the [[Root (linguistics)|root]] or [[Stem (linguistics)|stem]] of a [[word]] (or part of it) or even the whole word is repeated exactly or with a slight change.

Reduplication is used in [[inflection]]s to convey a grammatical function, such as plurality, intensification, etc., and in [[Lexicon|lexical]] [[Derivation (linguistics)|derivation]] to create new words. It is often used when a speaker adopts a tone more "expressive" or figurative than ordinary speech and is also often, but not exclusively, [[Iconicity|iconic]] in meaning. Reduplication is found in a wide range of languages and language groups, though its level of [[Productivity (linguistics)|linguistic productivity]] varies.

''Reduplication'' is the standard term for this phenomenon in the linguistics literature. Other terms that are occasionally used include ''cloning'', ''doubling'', ''duplication'', ''repetition'', and ''[[tautonym]]'' when it is used in [[Taxonomy (biology)|biological taxonomies]], such as "Bison bison".

The origin of this usage of ''tautonym'' is uncertain, but it has been suggested that it is of relatively recent derivation.

{{TOC limit|3}}

==Typological description==
{{IPA notice}}

===Form===
Reduplication is often described [[Phonology|phonologically]] in one of two different ways: either (1) as reduplicated ''segments'' (sequences of [[consonants]]/[[vowels]]) or (2) as reduplicated ''[[Prosody (linguistics)|prosodic]] units'' ([[syllable]]s or [[mora (linguistics)|moras]]). In addition to phonological description, reduplication often needs to be described [[Morphology (linguistics)|morphologically]] as a reduplication of linguistic [[Constituent (linguistics)|constituents]] (i.e. [[Word (linguistics)|words]], [[Stem (linguistics)|stems]], [[Root (linguistics)|roots]]). As a result, reduplication is interesting theoretically as it involves the interface between phonology and morphology.

The ''base'' is the word (or part of the word) that is to be copied. The reduplicated element is called the '''''reduplicant''''', often abbreviated as ''&lt;small&gt;RED&lt;/small&gt;'' or sometimes just ''R''.

In reduplication, the reduplicant is most often repeated only once. However, in some languages, reduplication can occur more than once, resulting in a tripled form, and not a ''duple'' as in most reduplication. '''Triplication''' is the term for this phenomenon of copying two times.{{sfn|Gates|2016}} [[Pingelapese]] has both reduplication and triplication:{{sfn|Rehg|1981}}

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Basic verb
! Reduplication
! Triplication
|-
| ''{{IPA|kɔul}}'' &amp;nbsp;'to sing'
| ''{{IPA|kɔukɔul}}'' &amp;nbsp;'singing'
| ''{{IPA|kɔukɔukɔul}}'' &amp;nbsp;'still singing'
|-
| ''{{IPA|mejr}}'' &amp;nbsp;'to sleep'
| ''{{IPA|mejmejr}}'' &amp;nbsp;'sleeping'
| ''{{IPA|mejmejmejr}}'' &amp;nbsp;'still sleeping'
|}

Triplication occurs in other languages, e.g. [[Ewe language|Ewe]], [[Shipibo language|Shipibo]], [[Twi language|Twi]], [[Mokilese language|Mokilese]], [[Min Nan]] ([[Hokkien]]), [[Horpa language|Stau]].{{sfn|Gates|2016}}

Sometimes [[gemination]] (i.e. the doubling of consonants or vowels) is considered to be a form of reduplication. The term ''dupleme'' has been used (after ''morpheme'') to refer to different types of reduplication that have the same meaning.

====Full and partial reduplication====
''Full reduplication'' involves a reduplication of the entire word. For example, [[Kham language|Kham]] derives reciprocal forms from [[Reflexive pronoun|reflexive]] forms by total reduplication:

{| style="line-height: 1.4em;" cellpadding="2"
|-
| &amp;nbsp;
| &amp;nbsp;
| {{IPA|[ɡin]}}
| 'ourselves'
| →
| {{IPA|[ɡinɡin]}}
| 'we (to) us'
| {{IPA|(ɡin-ɡin)}}
|-
| &amp;nbsp;
| &amp;nbsp;
| {{IPA|[jaː]}}
| 'themselves'
| →
| {{IPA|[jaːjaː]}}
| 'they (to) them'
| {{IPA|(jaː-jaː)}}
| &lt;small&gt;&lt;cite&gt;(Watters 2002)&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/small&gt;
|}

Another example is from Musqueam [[Halkomelem]] "dispositional" [[Grammatical aspect|aspect]] formation:

{| style="line-height: 1.4em;" cellpadding="2"
|-
| &amp;nbsp;
| &amp;nbsp;
| {{IPA|[kʼʷə́ɬ]}}
| 'to capsize'
| →
| {{IPA|[kʼʷə́ɬkʼʷəɬ]}}
| 'likely to capsize'
| {{IPA|(kʼʷə́ɬ-kʼʷəɬ)}}
|-
| &amp;nbsp;
| &amp;nbsp;
| {{IPA|[qʷél]}}
| 'to speak'
| →
| {{IPA|[qʷélqʷel]}}
| 'talkative'
| {{IPA|(qʷél-qʷel)}}
| &lt;small&gt;&lt;cite&gt;(Shaw 2004)&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/small&gt;
|}

''Partial reduplication'' involves a reduplication of only part of the word. For example, [[Marshallese language|Marshallese]] forms words meaning 'to wear X' by reduplicating the last ''consonant-vowel-consonant'' (''CVC'') sequence of a base, i.e. ''base''+''CVC'':

{| style="line-height: 1.4em;" cellpadding="2"
|-
| &amp;nbsp;
| &amp;nbsp;
| ''kagir''
| 'belt'
| →
| ''kagirgir''
| 'to wear a belt'
| (kagir-gir)
|-
| &amp;nbsp;
| &amp;nbsp;
| ''takin''
| 'sock'
| →
| ''takinkin''
| 'to wear socks'
| (takin-kin)
| &lt;small&gt;&lt;cite&gt;(Moravsik 1978)&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/small&gt;
|}

Many languages often use both full and partial reduplication, as in the [[Motu language|Motu]] example below:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Base verb
! Full reduplication
! Partial reduplication
|-
| ''mahuta'' &amp;nbsp;'to sleep'
| ''mahutamahuta'' &amp;nbsp;'to sleep constantly'
| ''mamahuta'' &amp;nbsp;'to sleep (plural)'
|-
| &amp;nbsp;
| (''mahuta-mahuta'')
| (''ma-mahuta'')
|}

====Reduplicant position====
Reduplication may be ''initial'' (i.e. [[Prefix (linguistics)|prefixal]]), ''final'' (i.e. [[suffix]]al), or ''internal'' (i.e. [[infix]]al), e.g.

'''Initial''' reduplication in [[Aeta peoples#Language|Agta]] ''(CV- prefix)'':
{| style="line-height: 1.4em;" cellpadding="2"
|-
| &amp;nbsp;
| &amp;nbsp;
| {{IPA|[ɸuɾab]}}
| 'afternoon'
| →
| {{IPA|[ɸuɸuɾab]}}
| 'late afternoon'
| {{IPA|(''ɸu''-ɸuɾab)}}
|-
| &amp;nbsp;
| &amp;nbsp;
| {{IPA|[ŋaŋaj]}}
| 'a long time'
| →
| {{IPA|[ŋaŋaŋaj]}}
| 'a long time (in years)'
| (''ŋa''-ŋaŋaj)
| &lt;small&gt;&lt;cite&gt;(Healey 1960)&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/small&gt;
|}

'''Final''' reduplication in [[Lakota language|Dakota]] ''(-CCV suffix)'':
{| style="line-height: 1.4em;" cellpadding="2"
|-
| &amp;nbsp;
| &amp;nbsp;
| {{IPA|[hãska]}}
| 'tall (singular)'
| →
| {{IPA|[hãskaska]}}
| 'tall (plural)'
| (hãska-''ska'')
|-
| &amp;nbsp;
| &amp;nbsp;
| {{IPA|[waʃte]}}
| 'good (singular)'
| →
| {{IPA|[waʃteʃte]}}
| 'good (plural)'
| {{IPA|(waʃte-''ʃte'')}}
| &lt;small&gt;&lt;cite&gt;(Shaw 1980, Marantz 1982, Albright 2002)&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/small&gt;
|}

'''Internal''' reduplication in [[Samoan language|Samoan]] ''(-CV- infix)'':
{| style="line-height: 1.4em;" cellpadding="2"
|-
| &amp;nbsp;
| &amp;nbsp;
| ''savali''
| 'he/she walks' (singular)
| →
| ''savavali''
| 'they walk' (plural)
| (sa-''va''-vali)
|-
| &amp;nbsp;
| &amp;nbsp;
| ''alofa''
| 'he/she loves' (singular)
| →
| ''alolofa''
| 'they love' (plural)
| (a-''lo''-lofa)
| &lt;small&gt;&lt;cite&gt;(Moravcsik 1978, Broselow and McCarthy 1984)&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/small&gt;
|-
| &amp;nbsp;
| &amp;nbsp;
| ''le tamaloa''
| 'the man' (singular){{sfn|Pratt|1984}}
| →
| ''tamaloloa''
| 'men' (plural)
| (tama-''lo''-loa)
|}

Internal reduplication is much less common than the initial and final types.

====Copying direction====
A reduplicant can copy from either the left edge of a word (''left-to-right'' copying) or from the right edge (''right-to-left'' copying). There is a tendency for prefixing reduplicants to copy left-to-right and for suffixing reduplicants to copy right-to-left:

Initial '''L → R''' copying in Oykangand [[Kunjen]] (a [[Pama–Nyungan languages|Pama–Nyungan]] language of [[Australia]]):
{| style="line-height: 1.4em;" cellpadding="2"
|-
| &amp;nbsp;
| &amp;nbsp;
| {{IPA|[eder]}}
| →
| {{IPA|[ededer]}}
| 'rain'
| (''ed''-&lt;u&gt;ed&lt;/u&gt;er)
|-
| &amp;nbsp;
| &amp;nbsp;
| {{IPA|[alɡal]}}
| →
| {{IPA|[alɡalɡal]}}
| 'straight'
| (''alg''-&lt;u&gt;alg&lt;/u&gt;al)
|}

Final '''R → L''' copying in [[Sirionó]]:
{| style="line-height: 1.4em;" cellpadding="2"
|-
| &amp;nbsp;
| &amp;nbsp;
| ''achisia''
| →
| ''achisiasia''
| 'I cut'
| (achi&lt;u&gt;sia&lt;/u&gt;-''sia'')
|-
| &amp;nbsp;
| &amp;nbsp;
| ''ñimbuchao''
| →
| ''ñimbuchaochao''
| 'to come apart'
| (ñimbu&lt;u&gt;chao&lt;/u&gt;-''chao'')
| &lt;small&gt;&lt;cite&gt;(McCarthy and Prince 1996)&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/small&gt;
|}

Copying from the other direction is possible although less common:

Initial '''R → L''' copying in [[Tillamook language|Tillamook]]:
{| style="line-height: 1.4em;" cellpadding="2"
|-
| &amp;nbsp;
| &amp;nbsp;
| {{IPA|[ɡaɬ]}}

| {{IPA|[qtəq]}}
| 'they break'
| {{IPA|(''q''-tə&lt;u&gt;q&lt;/u&gt;)}}
| &lt;small&gt;&lt;cite&gt;(Reichard 1959)&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/small&gt;
|}

Final '''L → R''' copying in [[Chukchi language|Chukchi]]:
{| style="line-height: 1.4em;" cellpadding="2"
|-
| &amp;nbsp;
| &amp;nbsp;
| ''nute-''
| 'ground'
| →
| ''nutenut''
| 'ground (abs. sg.)'
| (&lt;u&gt;nut&lt;/u&gt;e-''nut'')
|-
| &amp;nbsp;
| &amp;nbsp;
| ''{{IPA|jilʔe-}}''
| 'gopher'
| →
| ''{{IPA|jilʔejil}}''
| 'gopher (abs. sg.)'
| {{IPA|(&lt;u&gt;jil&lt;/u&gt;ʔe-''jil'')}}
| &lt;small&gt;&lt;cite&gt;(Marantz 1982)&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/small&gt;
|}

Internal reduplication can also involve copying the beginning or end of the base. In Quileute, the first consonant of the base is copied and inserted after the first vowel of the base.

Internal '''L → R''' copying in [[Quileute language|Quileute]]:
{| style="line-height: 1.4em;" cellpadding="2"
|-
| &amp;nbsp;
| &amp;nbsp;
| {{IPA|[tsiko]}}
| 'he put it on'
| →
| {{IPA|[tsitsko]}}
| 'he put it on (frequentative)'
| (&lt;u&gt;ts&lt;/u&gt;i-''ts''-ko)
|-
| &amp;nbsp;
| &amp;nbsp;
| {{IPA|[tukoːjoʔ]}}
| 'snow'
| →
| {{IPA|[tutkoːjoʔ]}}
| 'snow here and there'
| (&lt;u&gt;t&lt;/u&gt;u-''t''-ko:jo’)
| &lt;small&gt;&lt;cite&gt;(Broselow and McCarthy 1984)&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/small&gt;
|}

In Temiar, the last consonant of the root is copied and inserted before the medial consonant of the root.

Internal '''R → L''' copying in [[Temiar language|Temiar]] (an [[Austroasiatic]] language of [[Malaysia]]):

| &lt;small&gt;&lt;cite&gt;(Broselow and McCarthy 1984, Walther 2000)&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/small&gt;
|}

A rare type of reduplication is found in [[Semai language|Semai]] (an Austroasiatic language of Malaysia). "Expressive minor reduplication" is formed with an initial reduplicant that copies the first and last segment of the base:

====Reduplication and other morphological processes====
&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Affix]] --&gt;

All of the examples above consist of only reduplication.  However, reduplication often occurs with other phonological and morphological process, such as [[elision|deletion]], [[affixation]] of non-reduplicating material, etc.

For instance, in [[Tz'utujil language|Tz'utujil]] a new '-ish' adjective form is derived from other words by suffixing the reduplicated first consonant of the base followed by the segment {{IPA|[oχ]}}. This can be written succinctly as ''{{IPA|-Coχ}}''. Below are some examples:

* {{IPA|[kaq]}} 'red' → {{IPA|[kaqkoχ]}} 'reddish' &amp;nbsp;{{IPA|(kaq-''k''-oχ)}}
* {{IPA|[qʼan]}} 'yellow' → {{IPA|[qʼanqʼoχ]}} 'yellowish' &amp;nbsp;{{IPA|(qʼan-''qʼ''-oχ)}}
* {{IPA|[jaʔ]}} 'water' → {{IPA|[jaʔjoχ]}} 'watery' &amp;nbsp;{{IPA|(jaʔ-''j''-oχ)}} &amp;nbsp; &lt;small&gt;&lt;cite&gt;(Dayley 1985)&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/small&gt;

[[Somali language|Somali]] has a similar suffix that is used in forming the plural of some nouns: ''-aC'' (where ''C'' is the last consonant of the base):

* {{IPA|[toɡ]}} 'ditch' → {{IPA|[toɡaɡ]}} 'ditches' &amp;nbsp;{{IPA|(toɡ-a-''ɡ'')}}
* {{IPA|[ʕad]}} 'lump of meat' → {{IPA|[ʕadad]}} 'lumps of meat' &amp;nbsp;{{IPA|(ʕad-a-''d'')}}
* {{IPA|[wɪːl]}} 'boy' → {{IPA|[wɪːlal]}} 'boys' &amp;nbsp;{{IPA|(wɪːl-a-''l'')}} &amp;nbsp; &lt;small&gt;&lt;cite&gt;(Abraham 1964)&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/small&gt;

This combination of reduplication and affixation is commonly referred to as ''fixed-segment reduplication''.

In [[Tohono O'odham]] initial reduplication also involves [[gemination]] of the first consonant in the distributive plural and in repetitive verbs:

* {{IPA|[nowiu]}} 'ox' → {{IPA|[nonnowiu]}} 'ox (distributive)' &amp;nbsp;(''no''-n-nowiu)
* {{IPA|[hódai]}} 'rock' → {{IPA|[hohhodai]}} 'rock (distributive)' &amp;nbsp;(''ho''-h-hodai)
* {{IPA|[kow]}} 'dig out of ground (unitative)' → {{IPA|[kokkow]}} 'dig out of ground (repetitive)' &amp;nbsp;(''ko''-k-kow)
* {{IPA|[ɡɨw]}} 'hit (unitative)' → {{IPA|[ɡɨɡɡɨw]}} 'hit (repetitive)' &amp;nbsp;{{IPA|(''ɡɨ''-ɡ-ɡɨw)}} &amp;nbsp; &lt;small&gt;&lt;cite&gt;(Haugen forthcoming)&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/small&gt;

Sometimes gemination can be analyzed as a type of reduplication.

* underapplication

===Function and meaning===
In the [[Malayo-Polynesian]] family, reduplication is used to form plurals (among many other functions):
*[[Malay language|Malay]] ''rumah'' "house", ''rumah-rumah'' "houses".

In pre-1972 [[Indonesian language|Indonesian]] and [[Malay language|Malay]] orthography, ''2'' was shorthand for the reduplication that forms plurals: ''orang'' "person", ''orang-orang'' or ''orang2'' "people".{{sfn|Omar|1989}} This orthography has resurfaced widely in text messaging and other forms of electronic communication.

The [[Nama language]] uses reduplication to increase the force of a [[verb]]: ''go'', "look;", ''go-go'' "examine with attention".

[[Chinese language|Chinese]] also uses reduplication: {{lang|zh|人}} ''rén'' for "person", {{lang|zh|人人}} ''rénrén'' for "everybody". [[Japanese language|Japanese]] does it too: {{lang|ja|時}} ''toki'' "time", ''tokidoki'' {{lang|ja|時々}} "sometimes, from time to time".  Both languages can use a special written [[iteration mark]] {{lang|ja|々}} to indicate reduplication, although in Chinese the iteration mark is no longer used in standard writing and is often found only in [[calligraphy]].

[[Indo-European languages]] formerly used reduplication to form a number of [[verb]] forms, especially in the [[preterite]] or [[perfect (grammar)|perfect]].  In the older Indo-European languages, many such verbs survive:

*''spondeo'', ''spopondi'' ([[Latin]], "I vow, I vowed")
* {{lang|grc|λείπω, λέλοιπα}} ([[Greek language|Greek]], "I leave, I left")
* {{lang|grc|δέρκομαι, δέδορκα}} (Greek, "I see, I saw"; these Greek examples exhibit [[ablaut]] as well as reduplication)
*''háitan'', ''haíháit'' ([[Gothic language|Gothic]], "to name, I named")

Those forms do not survive in Modern English but existed in its parent [[Germanic languages]]. Many verbs in the Indo-European languages exhibit reduplication in the [[present tense|present]] stem, rather than the perfect stem, often with a different vowel from that used for the perfect: Latin ''gigno, genui'' ("I beget, I begat") and Greek τίθημι, ἔθηκα, τέθηκα (I place, I placed, I have placed). Other Indo-European verbs used reduplication as a derivational process: compare Latin ''sto'' ("I stand") and ''sisto'' ("I remain"). All of those Indo-European inherited reduplicating forms are subject to reduction by other phonological laws.

Reduplication can be used to refer to the most prototypical instance of a word's meaning. In such a case, it is called [[contrastive focus reduplication]]. Finnish colloquial speech uses the process; nouns can be reduplicated to indicate genuinity, completeness, originality and being uncomplicated, as opposed to being fake, incomplete, complicated or fussy. It can be thought as compound word formation. For example, ''Söin jäätelöä ja karkkia, sekä tietysti ruokaruokaa.'' "I ate ice cream and candy, and of course food-food". Here, "food-food" is contrasted to "junk-food". One may say, "En ollut eilen koulussa, koska olin kipeä. Siis kipeäkipeä" ("I wasn't at school yesterday because I was sick. Sick-sick, that is"); that means that one was actually suffering from an illness instead of making up excuses, as usual.

* ''ruoka'' "food", ''ruokaruoka'' "proper food", as opposed to snacks
* ''peli'' "game", ''pelipeli'' "complete game", as opposed to a [[Mod (computer gaming)|mod]]
* ''puhelin'' "phone", ''puhelinpuhelin'' "phone for talking", as opposed to a pocket computer
* ''kauas'' "far away", ''kauaskauas'' "unquestionably far away"
* ''koti'' "home", ''kotikoti'' "home of your parents", as opposed to one's current place of residence

Words can be reduplicated with their case morphemes, as in ''lomalla lomalla'', where the adessive morpheme (-''-lla'') appears twice. While reduplication is intelligible to most Finns, its usage is confined mostly to subgroups of young women and children (and possibly fathers of young children when they talk to their children). However, most young women and children do not use reduplication. Reduplication has a somewhat childish connotation and may be perceived as annoying.

In [[Swiss German]], the verbs ''gah'' or ''goh'' "go", ''cho'' "come", ''la'' or ''lo'' "let" and ''aafa'' or ''aafo'' "begin" reduplicate when they are combined with other verbs.

In some [[Salishan languages]], reduplication can mark both diminution and plurality, with one process being applied to each end of the word, as in the following example from [[Shuswap language|Shuswap]]. Note that the transcriprion is not comparable to the [[International Phonetic Alphabet|IPA]], but the reduplication of both initial and final portions of the root is clear: ''ṣōk!Emē'’n'' 'knife' reduplicated as ''ṣuk!ṣuk!Emen'’me’n'' 'plural small knives' (Haeberlin 1918:159). Reduplication has been found to be a major part of Salish languages.{{sfn|Czaykowska-Higgins|Kinkade|1998|pp=18ff}}

==Reduplicative babbling in child language acquisition==
During the period 25–50 weeks after birth, all typically developing infants go through a stage of reduplicated or canonical [[babbling]] (Stark 198, Oller, 1980). Canonical babbling is characterized by repetition of identical or nearly identical consonant-vowel combinations, such as 'nanana' or 'didididi'. It appears as a progression of language development as infants experiment with their vocal apparatus and home in on the sounds used in their native language. Canonical/reduplicated babbling also appears at a time when general rhythmic behavior, such as rhythmic hand movements and rhythmic kicking, appear. Canonical babbling is distinguished from earlier syllabic and vocal play, which has less structure.

==Examples==
===Indo-European===
====Proto-Indo-European====
The [[Proto-Indo-European language]] used partial reduplication of a consonant and ''e'' in many [[Proto-Indo-European verb#Stative|stative aspect]] verb forms. The perfect or preterite (past) tense of some [[Ancient Greek#Reduplication|Ancient Greek]],{{sfn|Smyth|1920|loc=[http://www.ccel.org/s/smyth/grammar/html/smyth_2Vp_uni.htm §440]: simple consonant + e}} [[Gothic language#Verbs|Gothic]], and [[Latin]] verbs preserves this reduplication:
*Ancient Greek {{lang|grc|λύω}} ''lúō'' 'I free' vs. {{lang|grc|λέλυκα}} ''léluka'' "I have freed"
*Gothic ''hald'' "I hold" vs. ''haíhald'' (''hĕhald'') "I/he held"
*Latin {{lang|la|currō}} "I run" vs. {{lang|la|cucurrī}} "I ran" or "have run"
*Old Norse ''rœ'' "I row" vs. ''rera'' (''røra'') "I rowed"

Proto-Indo-European also used reduplication for [[Proto-Indo-European verb#Root aspect|imperfective aspect]]. Ancient Greek preserves this reduplication in the present tense of some verbs. Usually, but not always, this is reduplication of a consonant and ''i'', and contrasts with e-reduplication in the perfect:{{sfn|Smyth|1920|loc=[http://www.ccel.org/s/smyth/grammar/html/smyth_2Vp_uni.htm §447]: initial consonant + i}}

*{{lang|grc|δίδωμι}} ''dídōmi'' "I give" (present)
*{{lang|grc|δέδωκα}} ''dédōka'' "I have given" (perfect)
* *{{lang|grc|σίσδω}} ''sísdō'' → {{lang|grc|ἵζω}} ''hízō'' "I set" (present)
* *{{lang|grc|σέσδομαι}} ''sésdomai'' → {{lang|grc|ἕζομαι}} ''hézomai'' "I sit down" (present; from sd-, [[Indo-European ablaut#Ablaut in Proto-Indo-European|zero-grade]] of [[Proto-Indo-European root|root]] in *sed-os → ἕδος ''hédos'' "seat, abode")

Reduplication in nouns was rare, the best example being Proto-Indo-European ''{{PIE|*kʷé-kʷl-os}}'' '[[wheel]]' (cf. [[Lithuanian language|Lithuanian]] ''kãklas'' 'neck', [[Sanskrit]] ''cakrá'' 'wheel'), which doubled *''kʷel-o-'' (cf. [[Old Prussian]] ''kelan'' 'wheel', [[Welsh language|Welsh]] ''pel'' 'ball'),{{sfn|Kroonen|2013|pp=264–265}} itself likely a deverbative of *''kʷelh₁-'' 'to turn'.

====English====
English has several types of reduplication, ranging from informal expressive vocabulary (the first four forms below) to grammatically meaningful forms (the last two below).

* '''Rhyming reduplication''': hokey-pokey, razzle-dazzle, super-duper, boogie-woogie, teenie-weenie, walkie-talkie, hoity-toity, wingding, ragtag, easy-peasy, hurdy-gurdy.
* '''Exact reduplications''' (baby-talk-like): bye-bye, choo-choo, night-night, no-no, pee-pee, poo-poo. In South African English, 'now-now' means 'somewhat later' (whereas an ordinary 'now' generally means 'immediately', but can also be used to mean 'somewhat later', depending on the tone of speech). 
* '''[[Ablaut]] reduplications''': chit-chat, [[hip-hop]], ding-dong, jibber-jabber, kitty-cat, knick-knack, pitter-patter, splish-splash, zig-zag, flimflam, wibble-wobble.  In ablaut reduplications, the first vowel is almost always a [[high vowel]] and the reduplicated ablaut variant of the vowel is a [[low vowel]].
* '''[[Shm-reduplication]]''' can be used with most any word; e.g. ''baby-shmaby'', ''cancer-shmancer'' and ''fancy-shmancy''. This process is a feature of [[American English]] from [[Yiddish language|Yiddish]], starting among the [[American Jews]] of [[New York City]], then the [[New York City English|New York dialect]] and then the whole country.

Only the last of the above types is [[Productivity (linguistics)|productive]], meaning that examples of the first three are fixed forms and new forms are not easily accepted.

* '''[[Comparative]] reduplication''': In the sentence "John's apple looked redder and redder," the reduplication of the [[comparative]] indicates that the comparative is becoming more true over time, meaning roughly "John's apple looked progressively redder as time went on."  In particular, this construction does ''not'' mean that John's apple is redder than some other apple, which would be a possible interpretation in the absence of reduplication, e.g. in "John's apple looked redder."  With reduplication, the comparison is of the object being compared to itself over time.  Comparative reduplication always combines the reduplicated comparative with "and".  This construction is common in speech and is used even in formal speech settings, but it is less common in formal written texts.  Although English has simple constructs with similar meanings, such as "John's apple looked ever redder," these simpler constructs are rarely used in comparison with the reduplicative form.  Comparative reduplication is fully [[Productivity (linguistics)|productive]] and clearly changes the meaning of any comparative to a temporal one, despite the absence of any time-related words in the construction.  For example, the temporal meaning of "The frug seemed wuggier and wuggier" is clear: Despite not knowing what a frug is or what wugginess is, we know that the apparent wugginess of the frug was increasing over time, as indicated by the reduplication of the comparative "wuggier".
* '''[[Contrastive focus reduplication]]''': Exact reduplication can be used with contrastive focus (generally where the first noun is [[Stress (linguistics)|stressed]]) to indicate a literal, as opposed to figurative, example of a noun, or perhaps a sort of [[Platonic idealism|Platonic ideal]] of the noun, as in "Is that carrot cheesecake or carrot CAKE-cake?".{{sfn|Ghomeshi|Jackendoff|Rosen|Russell|2004}} This is similar to the Finnish use mentioned above. Furthermore, it is used to contrast "real" or "pure" things against imitations or less pure forms. For example, at a coffee shop one may be asked, "Do you want soy milk?" and respond, "No, I want '''milk''' milk." This gives the idea that they want "real" milk.

The [[double copula]] is in some cases a type of reduplication, which may be regarded as non-standard or incorrect.

More can be learned about English reduplication in {{harvtxt|Thun|1963}}, {{harvtxt|Cooper|Ross|1975}}, and {{harvtxt|Nevins|Vaux|2003}}.

====Latin====
{{see also|Latin declension#Correlatives}}
In addition to having some reduplicated presents and perfects, Latin uses reduplication for some [[indefinite relative pronoun]]s, such as ''quisque'' "whoever" and ''ubiubi'' "wherever".

''Latin jingles''. There are also several complete two-word sentences such as: 
''Cǒmam cōmam.'' "I shall tidy my hair."&lt;ref&gt;BL Arundel 83 f126v{{full citation needed|date=April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Dutch====
While not common in Dutch, reduplication does exist. Most, but not all (e.g., ''pipi'', ''blauwblauw'' (laten), ''taaitaai'' (gingerbread)) reduplications in Dutch are [[loanword]]s (e.g., ''koeskoes'', ''bonbon'', (ik hoorde het) ''via via'') or imitative (e.g., ''tamtam'', ''tomtom'').{{sfn|Gilbers|2009}} Another example is a former safe sex campaign slogan in Flanders: ''Eerst bla-bla, dan boem-boem'' (''First talk, then have sex''; lit. ''First blah-blah, then boom-boom''). In Dutch the verb "gaan" (''to go'') can be used as an auxiliary verb, which can lead to a triplication: ''we gaan (eens) gaan gaan'' (we are going to get going). The use of ''gaan'' as an auxiliary verb with itself is considered incorrect, but is commonly used in Flanders.{{sfn|Taal.vrt.be|1999}} Numerous examples of reduplication in Dutch (and other languages) are discussed by Daniëls (2000).

====Afrikaans====
[[Afrikaans]] makes use of reduplication to emphasize the meaning of the word repeated and to denote a plural or event happening in more than one place.  For example, ''krap'' means "to scratch one's self," while ''krap-krap-krap'' means "to scratch one's self vigorously",{{sfn|van der Walt|2002}} whereas "dit het plek-plek gereën", means "it rained here and there".{{sfn|Botha|1984}} Reduplication in Afrikaans has been described extensively in the literature – see for example {{harvtxt|Botha|1988}}, {{harvtxt|Van Huyssteen|2004}} and {{harvtxt|Van Huyssteen|Wissing|2007}}. Further examples of this include: "koes" (to dodge) being reduplicated in the sentence "Piet hardloop koes-koes weg" (Piet is running away while constantly dodging / cringing); "sukkel" (to struggle) becoming "sukkel-sukkel" (making slow progress; struggling on); and "kierang" (to cheat) becoming "kierang-kierang" to indicate being cheated on repeatedly.{{sfn|Mount Allison University}}

====Romance====
In [[Italian language|Italian]] reduplication was used both to create new words or word associations (''tran-tran'', ''via via'', ''leccalecca'') and to intensify the meaning (''piano piano'' "very slowly").

Common in [[Mediterranean Lingua Franca|Lingua Franca]], particularly but not exclusively for onomatopoeic action descriptions:
"''Spagnoli venir...boum boum...andar; Inglis venir...boum boum bezef...andar; Francés venir...tru tru tru...chapar.''" ("The Spaniards came, cannonaded, and left. The English came, cannonaded heavily, and left. The French came, trumpeted on bugles, and captured it."){{sfn|Corré|2005}}

Common uses for reduplication in [[French language|French]] are the creation of [[hypocoristic]]s for [[French names|names]], whereby ''Louise'' becomes ''Loulou'', and [[Zinedine Zidane]] becomes ''Zizou''; and in many nursery words, like ''dada'' 'horsie' (vs. ''cheval'' 'horse'), ''tati'' 'auntie' (vs. ''tante'' 'aunt'), or ''tonton'' 'unkie' (vs. ''oncle'' 'uncle').

In [[Romanian language|Romanian]] and [[Catalan language|Catalan]], reduplication is not uncommon and it has been used for both the creation of new words (including many from [[onomatopoeia]]) and expressions, for example,
*Romanian: ''mormăi'', ''ţurţur'', ''dârdâi'', expressions ''talmeş-balmeş'', ''harcea-parcea'', ''terchea-berchea'', ''ţac-pac'', ''calea-valea'', ''hodoronc-tronc''.
*Catalan: ''balandrim-balandram, baliga-balaga, banzim-banzam, barliqui-barloqui, barrija-barreja, bitllo-bitllo, bub-bub, bum-bum, but-but, catric-catrac, cloc-cloc, cloc-piu, corre-corrents, de nyigui-nyogui, farrigo-farrago, flist-flast, fru-fru, gara-gara, gloc-gloc, gori-gori, leri-leri, nap-buf, ning-nang, ning-ning, non-non, nyam-nyam, nyau-nyau, nyec-nyec, nyeu-nyeu, nyic-nyic, nyigo-nyigo, nyigui-nyogui, passa-passa, pengim-penjam, pif-paf, ping-pong, piu-piu, poti-poti, rau-rau, ringo-rango, rum-rum, taf-taf, tam-tam, tau-tau, tic-tac, tol·le-tol·le, tric-trac, trip-trap, tris-tras, viu-viu, xano-xano, xau-xau, xerric-xerrac, xim-xim, xino-xano, xip-xap, xiu-xiu, xup-xup, zig-zag, ziga-zaga, zim-zam, zing-zing, zub-zub, zum-zum''.

In colloquial Mexican Spanish it is common to use reduplicated adverbs such as ''luego luego'' (after after) meaning "immediately", or ''casi casi'' (almost almost) which intensifies the meaning of 'almost'.

====Slavic languages====

The [[reduplication in the Russian language]] serves for various kinds of intensifying of the meaning and exists in several forms: a [[hyphenated]] or repeated [[word]] (either exact or inflected reduplication), and forms similar to [[shm-reduplication]].{{sfn|Voinov|2012}}

====Celtic languages====
Reduplication is a common feature of [[Irish language|Irish]] and includes the examples ''rírá'', ''ruaille buaille'' both meaning 'commotion' and ''fite fuaite'' meaning 'intertwined'.{{sfn|''Pota Focal''|loc=[http://www.potafocal.com/gt/?s=fite+fuaite "fite fuaite"]}}

====Persian====
Reduplication is a very common practice in [[Persian language|Persian]], to the extent that there are jokes about it. Mainly due to the mixed nature of the Persian language, most of the reduplication comes in the form of a phrase consisting of a Persian word -va- ({{lang-fa|وَ}} = and) and an [[Arabic language|Arabic]] word, like ''"Taghdir-Maghdir"'' ({{lang|fa|تقدیرمقدیر|rtl=yes}}). Reduplication is particularly common in the city of [[Shiraz]] in southwestern [[Iran]]. One can further categorize the reduplicative words into "True" and "Quasi" ones. In true reduplicative words, both words are actually real words and have meaning in the language in which it is used. In quasi-reduplicative words, at least one of the words does not have a meaning. Some examples of true reduplicative words in Persian are: ''"Xert-o-Pert"'' ({{lang|fa|خرت‌وپرت}} = Odds and ends); ''"Čert-o-Pert"'' ({{lang|fa|چرت‌وپرت}} = Nonsense); ''"Čarand-[o-]Parand"'' ({{lang|fa|چرند[و]پرند}} = Nonsense); ''"Āb-o-Tāb"'' ({{lang|fa|آب‌وتاب}} = much detail). Among the quasi-reduplicative words are ''"Zan-[o-]man"'' ({{lang|fa|زن[و]من}} = wife); ''"Da'vā-Ma'vā"'' ({{lang|fa|دعوامعوا|rtl=yes}} = Argument); ''"Talā-malā"'' ({{lang|fa|طلاملا|rtl=yes}} = jewelry); and ''"Raxt-o-Paxt"'' ( = Items of clothing). Reduplication in Persian is sometimes a mockery of words with non-Persian origins.

====Indo-Aryan (and Dravidian) languages====
Typically all Indo-Aryan languages, like [[Hindi]], [[Punjabi language|Punjabi]], [[Gujarati language|Gujarati]] and [[Bengali language|Bengali]] use partial or echoic reduplication in some form or the other. It is usually used to sound casual, or in a suggestive manner. It is often used to mean ''etcetera''. For example, in Hindi, chai-shai (''chai'' means tea, while this phrase means tea or any other supplementary drink or tea along with snacks). Quite common in casual conversations are a few more examples like shopping-wopping, khana-wana.
Reduplication is also used in [[Dravidian languages]] like [[Telugu language|Telugu]] for the same purpose.{{sfn|Emeneau|1971}}
South Asian languages are also rich in other forms of reduplication: morphological (expressives), lexical (distributives), and phrasal (aspectual).
*morphological: मनात हूर हूर दाटून येते {{sfn|Kulkarni|2013}}
*:          ''manaa-t hur-hur daaT.un yete''
*:            mind-in longing choking comes
*: 'Yearning desire floods into my heart.' [[Marathi language|Marathi]] 
*lexical: 'Each-each boy take one-one chair.' [[Indian English]]
*phrasal: పిల్లవాడు నడుస్తూ నడుస్తూ పడి పోయాడు {{sfn|Abbi|1992|p=37}}
*: ''pillavāḍu naḍustū naḍustū paḍi pōyāḍu''
*: child walking walking fall went
*: 'The child fell down while walking.' [[Telugu language|Telugu]]

Reduplication also occurs in the 3th{{Clarify|date=November 2014|reason=Should this be '3rd' or something else?}} gaṇa (verb class) of the Sanskrit language: ''bibheti'' "he fears", ''bibharti'' "he bears", ''juhoti'' "he offers", ''dadāti'', "he gives". Even though the general idea is to reduplicate the verb root as a prefix, several sandhi rules change the final outcome.

====Nepalese====
A number of [[Nepali language|Nepalese]] nouns are formed by reduplication.  As in other languages, the meaning is not that of a true plural, but collectives that refer to a set of the same or related objects, often in a particular situation.

For example, "rangi changi" describes an object that is extremely or vividly colorful, like a crazy mix of colors and/or patterns, perhaps dizzying to the eye.  The phrase "hina mina" means "scattered," like a large collection of objects spilled (or scampering, as in small animals) in all different directions.  The basic Nepalese word for food, "khana" becomes "khana sana" to refer to the broad generality of anything served at a meal.  Likewise, "chiya" or tea (conventionally made with milk and sugar) becomes "chiya siya": tea and snacks (such as biscuits or cookies). (Please note, these examples of Nepalese words are spelled with a simplified Latin [[transliteration]] only, not as exact spellings.)

===Turkish===
In [[Turkish language|Turkish]] there are two kinds of reduplication:

# A word can be reduplicated while replacing the initial consonants (not being ''m'', and possibly missing) with ''m''. The effect is that the meaning of the original word is broadened. For example, ''tabak'' means "plate(s)", and ''tabak mabak'' then means "plates, dishes and such". This can be applied not only to nouns but to all kinds of words, as in ''yeşil meşil'' meaning "green, greenish, whatever". Although not used in formal written Turkish, it is a completely standard and fully accepted construction.
# A word can be reduplicated totally, giving a related but different meaning or used for emphasizing. For example, ''zaman zaman'' (time time) meaning "occasionally"; ''uzun uzun'' (long long) meaning "very long or many things long". This type is used also in formal Turkish, especially in literature.

===Uralic===
====Finnish====
As described earlier, [[contrastive lexical reduplication]] is used in colloquial Finnish speech. Another type of reduplication occurs in Standard Finnish; reduplication as an [[intensifier]]. Common examples of this include ''suurensuuri'' (big-GEN big-NOM) literally "big of big(ness)", ''pienenpieni'' (small-GEN small-NOM) literally "small of small(ness)", ''hienonhieno'' (fine-GEN fine-NOM). The last example, literally "fine of fine(ness)," roughly means "very fine". Other adjectives may sometimes be duplicated as well, where a [[superlative]] is too strong an expression, somewhat similarly to Slavic languages. This construction can be ambiguous because of its use of a genitive noun followed by a nominative noun, which is not unique to reduplication. For instance the reduplicated form ''suurensuuri jalka'' (big foot of bigness) sounds the same as ''suuren suuri jalka'' (big foot of someone big).

====Hungarian====
Reduplication is usually rhyming. It can add emphasis: 'pici' (tiny) -&gt; ici-pici (very tiny) and  it can modify meaning: 'néha-néha' ('seldom-seldom': seldom but repeatedly),  'erre-arra' ('this way-that way', meaning movement without a definite direction), 'ezt-azt' ('this-that', meaning 'all sort of things'), Reduplication often evokes a sense of playfulness and it's quite common when talking to small children.

===Bantu languages===
Reduplication is a common phenomenon in [[Bantu languages]] and is usually used to form a [[frequentive]] verb or for emphasis.{{sfn|Lodhi|2002}}{{sfn|Downing|2001}}
* [[Swahili language|Swahili]] ''piga'' 'to strike'; ''pigapiga'' 'to strike repeatedly'
* [[Luganda|Ganda]] ''okukuba'' (''oku-kuba'') 'to strike'; ''okukubaakuba'' (''oku-kuba-kuba'') 'to strike repeatedly, to batter'
* [[Chewa language|Chewa]] ''tambalalá'' 'to stretch one's legs'; ''tambalalá-tambalalá'' to stretch one's legs repeatedly'
Popular names that have reduplication include
* [[Bafana Bafana]]
* [[Chipolopolo]]
* [[Eric Djemba-Djemba]]
* [[Lomana LuaLua|Lualua]]
* [[Ngorongoro]]

===Semitic===
[[Semitic languages]] frequently reduplicate consonants, though often not the vowels that appear next to the consonants in some verb form.{{sfn|Butts|2011}} This can take the shape of reduplicating the antepenultimate consonant (usually the second of three),{{clarify|reason=second of three is not antepenultimate|date=September 2015}} the last of two consonants, or the last two consonants.{{sfn|Unseth|2003}}

====Hebrew====
In the [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]], reduplication is used in nouns and adjectives. For stress, as in {{Hebrew|לאט לאט}} (le-aht le-aht) where the adverb {{Hebrew|לאט}} 'slowly' – is duplicated to mean very slowly. In a new slang expression, {{Hebrew|גבר גבר}} (Gever Gever), the noun {{Hebrew|גבר}} 'man' – is duplicated to mean a manly man, a man among man.

Meaning each and every, one by one, as in {{Hebrew|יום יום}} (yom yom) where the noun {{Hebrew|יום}} 'day' is duplicated to every day, day in day out, day by day.

Some nouns and adjectives can also be made into diminutives by reduplication of the last two consonants (biconsonantal reduplication), e.g.
* {{Hebrew|כלב}} (Kelev) - Dog
** {{Hebrew|כלבלב}} (Klavlav) - Puppy
* {{Hebrew|חתול}} (Chatul) - Cat
** {{Hebrew|חתלתול}} (Chataltul) - Kitten
* {{Hebrew|לבן}} (Lavan) - White
** {{Hebrew|לבנבן}} (Levanban) - Whitish
* {{Hebrew|קטן}} (Katan) - Small
** {{Hebrew|קטנטן}} (Ktantan) - Tiny

Reduplication in Hebrew is also productive for the creation of verbs, by reduplicating the root or part of it e.g.:

dal ({{Hebrew|דל}}) 'poor, spare' &gt; dilel ({{Hebrew|דלל}}) 'to dilute' but also dildel ({{Hebrew|דלדל}}) 'to impoverish, to weaken';
nad ({{Hebrew|נד}}) 'to move, to nod' &gt; nadad ({{Hebrew|נדד}}) 'to wander' but also nidned ({{Hebrew|נדנד}}) 'to swing, to nag'.

====Amharic====
In [[Amharic language|Amharic]], verb roots can be reduplicated three different ways. These can result in verbs, nouns, or adjectives (which are often derived from verbs).

From the root ''sbr'' 'break', antepenultimate reduplication produces ''täsäbabbärä'' 'it was shattered'{{sfn|Leslau|1995|p=1029}} and biconsonantal reduplication produces ''täsbäräbbärä'' 'it was shattered repeatedly' and ''səbərbari'' 'a shard, a shattered piece'.{{sfn|Unseth|2002}}

From the root ''kHb'' 'pile stones into a wall', since the second radical is not fully specified, what some call "hollow", the antepenultimate reduplication process reduplicates the ''k'' inserting the vowel ''a'' along with the consonant as a place holder for the hollow consonant, which is by some criteria antepenultimate, and produces ''akakabä'' 'pile stones repeatedly'.{{sfn|Leslau|1995|p=1035}}{{sfn|Tak|2016}}

===Sino-Tibetan===
====Burmese====
In [[Burmese language|Burmese]], reduplication is used in verbs and adjectives to form adverbs. Many Burmese words, especially adjectives such as {{lang|my|လှပ}} ('beautiful' {{IPA|[l̥a̰pa̰]}}), which consist of two syllables (when reduplicated, each syllable is reduplicated separately), when reduplicated ({{lang|my|လှပ}} → {{lang|my|လှလှပပ}} 'beautifully' {{IPA|[l̥a̰l̥a̰ pa̰pa̰]}}) become [[adverb]]s. This is also true of many Burmese verbs, which become adverbs when reduplicated.

Some nouns are also reduplicated to indicate plurality. For instance, {{my|ပြည်}}, means "country," but when reduplicated to {{my|အပြည်ပြည်}}, it means "many countries" (as in {{my|အပြည်ပြည်ဆိုင်ရာ}}, "international"). Another example is {{my|အမျိုး}}, which means "kinds," but the reduplicated form {{my|အမျိုးမျိုး}} means "multiple kinds."

A few measure words can also be reduplicated to indicate "one or the other":
*{{my|ယောက်}} (measure word for people) → {{my|တစ်ယောက်ယောက်}} (someone)
*{{my|ခု}} (measure word for things) → {{my|တစ်ခုခု}} (something)

====Chinese====
Adjective reduplication is common in [[Standard Chinese]], typically denoting emphasis, less acute degree of the quality described, or an attempt at more indirect speech: '' xiǎoxiǎo de'' 小小的 (small, tiny), ''chòuchòu de'' 臭臭的 (smelly). Reduplication can also reflect a "cute", juvenile or informal register; in this respect, it can be compared to the English diminutive ending "-y" or "-ie" (tiny, smelly, 狗狗 "doggie", etc.)

In the case of adjectives composed of two characters (morphemes), generally each of the two characters is reduplicated separately: ''piàoliang'' 漂亮 (beautiful) reduplicates as ''piàopiàoliangliang'' 漂漂亮亮.

Verb reduplication is also common in Standard Chinese, conveying the meaning of informal and temporary character of the action. It is often used in imperative expressions, in which it lessens the degree of imperativity: ''zuòzuò'' 坐坐 (sit (for a while)), '' děngděng'' 等等 (wait (for a while)). Compound verbs are reduplicated as a whole word: ''xiūxixiūxi'' 休息休息 (rest (for a while)). This can be analyzed as an instance of omission of "一" (originally, e.g., "坐一坐" or "等一等" ) or "一下" (originally, e.g., "坐一下").

Noun reduplication, though nearly absent in Standard Chinese, is found in the southwestern dialect of [[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin]]. For instance, in [[Sichuan Mandarin]], ''bāobāo'' 包包 (handbag) is used whereas Beijing use ''bāor'' 包儿. One notable exception is the colloquial use of ''bāobāo'' 包包 by non-Sichuanese speakers to denote a perceived fancy, attractive, or "cute" purse (somewhat equivalent to the English "baggie"). However, there are few nouns that can be reduplicated in Standard Chinese, and reduplication denotes generalisation and uniformity: ''rén'' 人 (human being) and ''rénrén'' 人人 (everybody (in general, in common)), ''jiājiāhùhù''  家家户户 (every household (uniformly)) – in the latter ''jiā'' and ''hù'' additionally duplicate the meaning of ''household'', which is a common way of creating compound words in Chinese.

===Japanese===
A small number of native [[Japanese language|Japanese]] nouns have [[collective number|collective]] forms produced by reduplication (possibly with [[rendaku]]), such as 人々 ''hitobito'' "people" (''h'' → ''b'' is rendaku) – these are written with the [[iteration mark]] "々" to indicate duplication.  This formation is not [[productivity (linguistics)|productive]] and is limited to a small set of nouns.  Similarly to Standard Chinese, the meaning is not that of a true [[plural]], but collectives that refer to a large, given set of the same object; for example, the formal English equivalent of 人々 would be "people" (collective), rather than "persons" (plural individuals).

Japanese also contains a large number of [[Japanese sound symbolism|mimetic words]] formed by reduplication of a syllable.  These words include not only [[onomatopoeia]], but also words intended to invoke non-auditory senses or psychological states, such as きらきら ''kirakira'' (sparkling or shining). By one count, approximately 43% of Japanese mimetic words are formed by full reduplication,{{sfn|Tamamura|1979}}{{sfn|Tamamura|1989}} and many others are formed by partial reduplication, as in がささ〜 ''ga-sa-sa-'' (rustling){{sfn|Nasu|2003}}&amp;nbsp;– compare English "''a''-ha-ha-ha".

===Austroasiatic===
====Vietnamese====
Words called '''''từ láy''''' are found abundantly in [[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese]]. They are formed by repeating a part of a word to form new words, altering the meaning of the original word. Its effect is to sometimes either increase or decrease the intensity of the adjective, or to generalize a word's meaning. It is often used as a literary device (like alliteration) in poetry and other compositions but is also prevalent in everyday speech. In some cases, the word's tone may be reduplicated in addition to an initial or final sound (see [[tone sandhi]]).

Examples of reduplication increasing intensity:
*''chỉ'' → ''chỉ trỏ'' (final L→R plus tone): to point → to point about
*''đau'' → ''đau điếng'' (final L→R): to hurt → to hurt horribly
*''khó'' → ''khó khăn'' (final L→R): difficult → severely difficult
*''mạnh'' → ''mạnh mẽ'' (final L→R): strong → very strong
*''nhẹ'' → ''nhè nhẹ'' (initial full, excluding tone): gently → as gently as possible
*''rực'' → ''rực rỡ'' (final L→R): flaring → blazing

Examples of reduplication decreasing intensity:
*''nhỏ'' → ''nho nhỏ'' (initial full, excluding tone): small → somewhat small
*''đỏ'' → ''đo đỏ'' (initial full, excluding tone): red → somewhat red
*''xanh'' → ''xanh xanh'' (full): blue/green → somewhat blue/green
*''xinh'' → ''xinh xinh'' (full): pretty → cute

Examples of generalization:
*''đau'' → ''đau đớn'' (final L→R): painful → pain and suffering
*''học'' → ''học hành'' (final L→R): to study (something) → to study (in general)
*''lỏng'' → ''lỏng lẻo'' (final L→R plus tone): watery → loose, insecure
*''máy'' → ''máy móc'' (final L→R plus tone): machine → machinery
*''nhanh'' → ''nhanh nhẹn'' (final L→R): rapid → nimble

Examples of blunt sounds or physical conditions:
*''loảng xoảng'' (R→L plus tone) — sound of glass breaking to pieces or metallic objects falling to the ground
*''hớt hải'' → ''hớt hơ hớt hải'' or ''hớt ha hớt hải'' (compound) — hard gasps → in extreme hurry, in panic, panic-stricken
*''lục đục'' (R→L) — the sound of hard, blunt (and likely wooden) objects hitting against each other → disagreements and conflicts inside a group or an organisation

Examples of emphasis without a change in meaning:
*''khúm núm'' → ''khúm na khúm núm'' (compound): to cower
*''vớ vẩn'' → ''vớ va vớ vẩn'' (compound): silly
*''bậy'' → ''bậy bạ'' (initial L→R plus tone): objectionable
*''nói bậy'' → ''nói bậy nói bạ'' (verb phrase): to say vulgarities

In colloquial speech, almost any arbitrary word can be reduplicated to express a dismissive attitude:
*''phim'' → ''phim phéo'' (final L→R): movie → movies and stuff

As seen above, disyllabic words undergo a complex transformation: &lt;first syllable&gt; &lt;left edge of second syllable plus a vowel&gt; &lt;first syllable&gt; &lt;second syllable&gt;.

====Khmer====
[[Khmer language|Khmer]] uses reduplication for several purposes, including emphasis and pluralization. The [[Khmer script]] includes a reduplication sign, &lt;big&gt;{{lang|km|ៗ}}&lt;/big&gt;, indicating that the word or phrase preceding it is to be pronounced twice. Reduplication in Khmer, like many Mon–Khmer languages, can express complex thoughts.  Khmer also uses a form of reduplication known as "synonym compounding", in which two phonologically distinct words with similar or identical meanings are combined, either to form the same term or to form a new term altogether.

===Austronesian===
{{expand section|date=June 2013}}
The wide use of reduplication is certainly one of the most prominent grammatical features of Malay (as well as of other South-East Asian and Austronesian languages).{{sfn|Lande|2003}}

====Malay (Indonesian and Malaysian)====
In Malay language, reduplication is a very productive process. It is used for expression of various grammatical functions (such as verbal aspect) and it is part in a number of complex morphological models. Simple reduplication of nouns and pronouns can express at least three meanings:

#Diversity or non-exhaustive plurality:
##''Burung-burung itu juga diekspor ke luar negeri'' = "All those birds are also exported out of the country".
#Conceptual similarity:
##''langit-langit'' = "ceiling; palate; etc." (''langit'' = "sky")
##''jari-jari'' = "spoke; bar; radius; etc." (''jari'' = "finger" etc.)
#Pragmatic accentuation:
##''Saya bukan anak-anak lagi!'' "I am not a child anymore!" (''anak'' = "child")

Reduplication of an adjective can express different things:
*Adverbialisation: ''Jangan bicara keras-keras!'' = "Don't speak loudly!" (''keras'' = hard)
*Plurality of the corresponding noun: ''Rumah di sini besar-besar'' = "The houses here are big" (''besar'' = "big").

Reduplication of a verb can express various things:
*Simple reduplication:
**Pragmatic accentuation: ''Kenapa orang tidak datang-datang?'' = "Why aren't people coming?"
*Reduplication with ''me-'' prefixation, depending on the position of the prefix ''me-'':
**Repetition or continuation of the action: ''Orang itu memukul-mukul anaknya'': "That man continuously beat his child";
**Reciprocity: ''Kedua orang itu pukul-memukul'' = "Those two men would beat each other".
Notice that in the first case, the nasalisation of the initial consonant (whereby /p/ becomes /m/) is repeated, while in the second case, it only applies in the repeated word.

====Tagalog====
In [[Tagalog language|Tagalog]], an [[Austronesian language]] spoken in the [[Philippines]], upon which the national language "Filipino" is based, reduplication is employed productively in multiple parts of speech.
Reduplication of the root, prefix or infix is employed to convey different [[grammatical aspect]]s in verbs. In "Mag- verbs" reduplication of the root after the prefix "mag-" or "nag-" changes the verb from the infinitive form, or perfective aspect, respectively, to the contemplated or imperfective aspect.{{sfn|Domigpe|Nenita|2012}} Thus:
*magluto inf/actor trigger-cook "to cook" or "cook!" ([[Imperative mood|Imperative]]) 
*nagluto actor trigger-cook "cooked"
*nagluluto actor trigger-reduplication-cook "cook" (as in "I cook all the time) or "is/was cooking"
*magluluto inf/actor trigger-rdplc-cook (contemplated) "will cook"

For [[Ergative verb]]s (frequently referred to as "object focus" verbs) reduplication of part the infix and the stem occur:
*lutuin cook-inf/object trigger-cook "to cook"
*niluto object trigger infix-cook (perf-cook) "cooked"
*niluluto object trigger infix-reduplication-cook "cook"/"is/was cooking"
*lulutuin rdp-cook-object trigger "will cook".{{sfn|Domigpe|Nenita|2012}}

Adjectives and adverbs employ morphological reduplication for many different reasons such as plurality agreement when the adjective modifies a plural noun, intensification of the adjective or adverb, and sometimes because the prefix forces the adjective to have a reduplicated stem".{{sfn|Domigpe|Nenita|2012}}

Agreement (optional, plurality, and agreement with a plural noun, is entirely optional in Tagalog (e.g. a plural noun does not have to have a plural article marking it":{{sfn|Domigpe|Nenita|2012}}
*"Ang magandang puno" "the beautiful tree".
*"Ang mga ma''ga''gandang puno" "the beautiful tree''s''".

The entire adjective is repeated for intensification of adjectives or adverbs:
*''Maganda''ng maganda ang kabayo "the horse is ''very'' pretty"

The complete superlative prefix pagka- demands reduplication of the first syllable of the adjective's stem:
*"Ang pagka''ga''gandang puno" "The ''most'' beautiful tree (''and there are none more beautiful anywhere'')"

Reduplication of nouns happens in Tagalog, but is far less productive, and more sporadic. Examples of such nouns formed by reduplication are "[[halo-halo]]" "ice cream" (lit. "mix mix") and "tago-tago" "[[refugee]] or even [[illegal immigrant]] (lit. "latent-latent").

====Tetum====
In [[Tetum]], reduplication is used to turn adjectives into [[superlatives]].

====Pingelapese====
Pingelapese is a Micronesian language spoken on the Pingelap atoll and on two of the eastern Caroline Islands, called the high island of Pohnpei. Pingelapese utilizes both duplication and triplication of a verb or part of a verb to express that something is happening for certain duration of time. No reduplication means that something happens. A reduplicated verb means that something IS happening, and a triplication means that something is STILL happening.  For example, ''saeng'' means 'to cry' in Pingelapese. When reduplicated and triplicated, the duration of this verb is changed:
* ''saeng'' – cries
* ''saeng-saeng'' – is crying
* ''saeng-saeng-saeng'' – is still crying

Few languages employ triplication in their language. In Micronesia, Pingelapese is one of only two languages that uses triplication, the other being Mokilese. Reduplication and triplication are not to be confused with tense however. In order to make a phrase past, present, or future tense, a temporal phrase must be used.{{sfn|Hattori|2012|pp=34–35}}

====Māori====
The [[Māori language]] ([[New Zealand]]) uses reduplication in a number of ways.{{sfn|Biggs|1998|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=7PZPA_JjCrQC&amp;pg=PA137 137]}}

Reduplication can convey a simple plural meaning, for instance ''wahine'' "woman", ''waahine'' "women", ''tangata'' "person", ''taangata'' "people". Biggs calls this "infixed reduplication". It occurs in a small subset of "people" words in most Polynesian languages.

Reduplication can convey emphasis or repetition, for example ''mate'' "die", ''matemate'' "die in numbers"; and de-emphasis, for example ''wera'' "hot" and ''werawera'' "warm".

Reduplication can also extend the meaning of a word; for instance ''paki'' "pat" becomes ''papaki'' "slap or clap once" and ''pakipaki'' "applaud"; ''kimo'' "blink" becomes ''kikimo'' "close eyes firmly"

===== Rapa =====
[[Rapa language|Rapa]] is the French Polynesian language of the island of [[Rapa Iti]].{{sfn|Walworth|2015}} In terms of reduplication, the indigenous language known as Old Rapa uses reduplication consistent to other Polynesian languages. Reduplication of Old Rapa occurs in four ways: full, rightward, leftward, and medial. Full and rightward are generally more frequently used as opposed to the leftward and medial. Leftward and medial only occur as CV reduplication and partial leftward and medial usually denote emphasis.{{sfn|Walworth|2015}}

Example of Reduplication Forms:{{sfn|Walworth|2015}}
{| class="wikitable"
|
|'''Base Form'''
|'''Reduplicated Form'''
|-
|'''Full Reduplication'''
|kini 'pinch'

kati 'bite'
|kini'''kini''' 'pinch skin'

kati'''kati''' 'nibble'
|-
|'''Rightward Reduplication'''
|māringi 'pour'

taka'uri 'go backward'

pātī 'bounce'

ngaru 'wave'
|māringi'''ringi''' 'pour continuously'

taka'uri'''&lt;nowiki/&gt;'uri''' 'roll back and forth'

pātī'''tī''' 'splash (of raindrops)'

ngaru'''ru''' 'sea sick'
|-
|'''Leftward Reduplication'''
|komo 'sleep'

kume 'drag'
|'''ko'''komo 'deep sleep'

'''ku'''kume 'large, flat leaf seaweed'
|-
|'''Medial Reduplication'''
|maitaki 'good; well'
|mai'''ta'''taki 'excellent; very well'
|}

For the Rapa Language the implementation of reduplication has specific implications. The most evident of these are known as iterative, intensification, specification, diminutive, metaphorical, nominalizing, and adjectival.{{sfn|Walworth|2015}}

'''Iterative:'''

* naku 'come, go' → nakunaku 'pass by frequently'
* ipuni 'hide' → ipunipuni 'hide and seek'

'''Intensification:'''

* mare 'cough' → maremare 'cough forcefully'
* roa 'much' → roroa 'very much'
* maki 'sick'makimaki 'really sick'

'''Specification:'''

* kini 'to pinch' → kinikini 'pinch skin'

'''Diminutive:'''

* paki 'slap, strike'pakipaki 'clap'
* kati 'bite' → katikati 'nibble'

'''Metaphorical (typically comparing an animal action with a human action):'''{{sfn|Walworth|2015}}

* kapa 'mime with hands' → kapakapa 'flap wings (a bird)'
* mākuru 'detach oneself' → mākurukuru 'shed or molt'
* taŋi 'Yell' → taŋitaŋi 'chirp (a bird)'

'''Nominalizing:'''

* para 'Finished'parapara 'leftovers'
* Panga'a 'divide' → panaga'anga'a 'a break, a divide'

'''Adjectival:'''

* repo 'dirt, earth' → reporepo 'dirty'
* pake 'sun' → pakepake 'shining, bright'

=====Wuvulu-Aua=====
Reduplication is not a productive noun derivation process in [[Wuvulu-Aua language|Wuvulu-Aua]] as it is in other Austronesian languages. Some nouns exhibit reduplication, though they are considered to be fossilized.{{sfn|Hafford|2015|p=47}}

Verb roots can undergo whole or partial reduplication to mark aspect. Actions that are continuous are indicated by a reduplicated initial syllable. A whole reduplication can also be used to indicate imperfective aspect.{{sfn|Hafford|2015|p=100}}
* "''roni''" "to hurry"
* "''roroni''" "hurrying"
* "''rawani''" "good"
* "''rarawani''" "good" (continuous)
* "''ware''" "talk"
* "''wareware''" "talked" (durative)

The onomatopoeia in Wuvulu language also uses reduplication to describe the sound. These onomatopoeic words can be used as alienable nouns. 
* "baʔa" or "baʔabaʔa" is a word for the sound of knocking.{{sfn|Hafford|2015|p=46}}

==== Mortlockese ====
The [[Mortlockese language]] is a Micronesian language spoken primarily on the [[Mortlock Islands (disambiguation)|Mortlock Islands]]. In the Mortlockese language, reduplication is used to show a habitual or imperfective aspect. For example, /jææjæ/ means "to use something" while the word /jæjjææjæ/ means "to use something habitually or repeatedly".{{sfn|Odango|2015}} Reduplication is also used in the Mortlockese Language to show extremity or extreme measures. One example of this can be seen in /ŋiimw alɛɛtɛj/ which means "hate him, her, or it". To mean "really hate him, her, or it," the phrase changes to /ŋii~mw al~mw alɛɛtɛj/.{{sfn|Odango|2015}}

===Australian Aboriginal languages===
{{main| List of reduplicated Australian place names}}
Reduplication is common in many Australian place names due to their Aboriginal origins. Some examples include [[Turramurra]], [[Parramatta]], [[Woolloomooloo]]. In the language of the [[Wiradjuri]] people of southeastern Australia, plurals are formed by doubling a word, hence 'Wagga' meaning crow becomes [[Wagga Wagga]] meaning 'place of many crows'. This occurs in other place names deriving from the Wiradjuri language including Gumly Gumly, [[Grong Grong]] and Book Book.

The '''Simalungun people''' are an ethnic group in [[North Sumatra]], considered one of the [[Batak (Indonesia)|Batak]] peoples. Simalungun people live mostly in [[Simalungun Regency]] and the surrounding areas, including the city of [[Pematang Siantar]], an autonomous city, but previously part of Simalungun Regency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Suku Simalungun: An Ethnic Group in Search of Representation |author=R. W. Liddle |journal=Indonesia |issue=3 |date=April 1967 |pages=1–28 |jstor=3350720}}&lt;/ref&gt; The regent of Simalungun is [[JR Saragih]].

The Simalungun live in the 'Eastern Batak' lands, bordering the lands of the [[Batak Toba people|Batak Toba]] to the south and west, and the [[Karo (people)|Batak Karo]] to the north. The Simalungun are considered to have more in common with their Karo than Toba neighbours, both groups having migrated from Toba and Pakpak in order to participate in trade.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.kitlv-journals.nl/index.php/btlv/article/viewFile/3113/3874&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Simalungun language]] is still spoken by many Simalungun people, in addition to Indonesian.

Long before Dutch colonialism was established in North-East Sumatra, people now known collectively as Batak Timur (Eastern Batak) claimed the area as their original homeland, for example Sin Raya (Raya's peoples), Sin Silou (Silou's peoples), Sin Bandar (Bandar's peoples), and so forth. Dutch colonialism was first established in the Malay area of Deli (Medan) under "De Vide et impera" (the concept of Dutch political colonialism). The Batak Timur people were ruled by raja (kings), considered to be living gods. One by one their kingdoms capitulated to Dutch aggression and expansionism. The Dutch then gave a collective name to their new colonial area of the Eastern Batak kingdoms, that name being Simeloengoen. With the current Indonesian orthography the name Simalungun is still used today, even among Eastern Batak people themselves.

The Simalungun people were ruled by ''raja'' (kings), considered to be living gods.&lt;ref name="asemus"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://masterpieces.asemus.museum/stories.aspx?id=176f5f92-c53a-41a8-a151-a78c67ea410c|title=VCM|publisher=masterpieces.asemus.museum|accessdate=2015-08-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; G.L. Tichelman (1893–1962), a Dutch researcher, described Simalungun villages as consisting of houses built parallel to rivers from wooden poles and [[Arenga pinnata|palm leaves]]. Houses could accommodate a single family (''rumah parsatanggaan''), or as many as twelve (''rumah parrumahopattanggaan'') with a designated area for each family within. The head of the village lived in the 'Rumah Bolon', the village's largest, most ornate house. The Head of Village was installed by, and loyal to The King. The main village or capital of each Kingdom were called 'Pematang.'
Villagers drove out spirits from the village by holding 'Robu Tabu', days on which the village would be decorated and outsiders excluded from the village.

Villages would bathe in a communal 'tapian', with water piped through bamboo tubes for bathing. The Simalungun also used bamboo tubes for carrying water back to the village. Religious ceremonies would often be held near the Tapian. 'Parsihili' were statues used to take an illness away from a person, while 'Pasiarhon' were statues used for communing with the dead. Although villagers would support victims of house fires, it was considered unlucky to offer them shelter for fear of further fires, and instead a new house would be constructed communally as soon as possible.

It was considered inappropriate to bargain with family members, so an intermediary would be used when purchasing items from family. Courtship was arranged in the marketplace using a [[betel nut]]. Girls wishing to avoid attention would give the nut to an old man, who would look after her during market day, or would wear a [[baby sling|hiou]], to suggest unavailability.

The pounding of rice was an important activity, and the communal 'Losung', or riceblock, was used for this activity, with a hole allocated for each family to use. A new losung would be cut from a tree trunk, and on an auspicious day decorated with flowers and transported into the village accompanied by music. A boy and girl dressed in ceremonial clothes would invest the new riceblock by throwing rice over it, and the villagers would sing songs.

The birth of a child was an auspicious occasion, and the ''dukun'' (midwife/witch doctor) was appointed to drive off spirits, and to cut the umbilical cord with a bamboo knife. The newborn baby would be swaddled and daubed with rice chewed by the ''dukun'' prior to the mother commencing breastfeeding. The placenta would be buried under the house and for seven nights a fire would be maintained to drive off spirits.

On the seventh day the child would be brought to the tapian. If the date of birth was an auspicious one, this would be done using by the mother a new [[hiou]], a ragi idup or ragi panei, but if the date was a bad one, the baby would be carefully brought by all the women of the village, who would set out to deceive the evil spirits in order to protect the baby. When the child was named, it would be given black, white and red bracelets for protective purposes.

A well-preserved traditional Simalungun village can be seen at Pematang Purba.&lt;ref name="asiaexplorers"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asiaexplorers.com/indonesia/pematang_purba.htm|title=Pematang Purba, North Sumatra, Indonesia|publisher=asiaexplorers.com|accessdate=2015-08-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Simalungun people==
[[File:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM Hoofden van Simaloengoen Oostkust Sumatra TMnr 10001819.jpg|thumb|right|Heads of Simalungun in East Coast Sumatra.]]
The concept of a cohesive Simalungun people is derived in part from Dutch colonialism. In 1870 the Dutch established the Residency of East Sumatra, centred on [[Medan]] in the Kingdom of Deli. In 1904 the [[Netherlands East Indies]] government signed surrender agreements with the seven kingdoms of the 'Simeloengoenlanden', in order to form the administrative of unit Simeloengoen en [[Karo (people)|Karolanden]].&lt;ref name="blogspot"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://girsangardho.blogspot.com/2009/03/sejarah-simalungun-oleh-mansen-purba-sh.html|title=Girsang Ardho: SEJARAH SIMALUNGUN oleh Mansen Purba SH|publisher=girsangardho.blogspot.com|accessdate=2015-08-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; These seven Simalungun kingdoms were the kingdoms of Siantar, Tanoh Jawa, Panei, Dolok Silou, Raya, Purba and Silimahuta. It has been suggested that Tanoh Jawa had more in common with early pagan Asahan (later to become the [[Asahan Sultanate]]) than it did with the other Simalungun kingdoms.&lt;ref name="google"&gt;{{cite book|title=Proceedings, American Philosophical Society (vol. 96, no. 6)|publisher=American Philosophical Society|isbn=978-1-4223-8181-6|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=J9BWRNOWkqQC&amp;pg=PA633|page=633|accessdate=2015-08-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The colonial seat was established in 1908 at Pematang Siantar. The Dutch colonial system encouraged migration, especially of Javanese and Tobanese labourers working on Dutch plantations, with both peoples bringing new influences to the area, which tended to cause the original people of Simalungun to be intimidated and marginalized. After World War II, in 1946, a social revolution occurred in [[East Sumatra]] which is viewed as a tragedy by the Simalungun people. Non-native settlers in East Sumatra demanded changes to the monarchy systems of Deli, Karo and Simalungun, and agitated for unity with the Javanese government which had been proclaimed as the Republic Of Indonesia in August, 1945. Many were kidnapped and killed, especially from the royal families of each Kingdom. The monarchy system in East Sumatra was deposed and, while the families are still intact and acknowledged by the Simalungun people as such among themselves, the titles are now entirely ceremonial within the Simalungun cultures.

==Christianity==
[[August Theis]], a German missionary arrived in Sumatra in 1902. He was subject to [[Ludwig Ingwer Nommensen]], who instructed him to head to the Simalungun region. They arrived on 2 September 1903, a day now commemorated by the Simalungun church. Theis opened several schools, and returned to the Netherlands in 1921.

The first translation of [[The Bible]] into an indigenous Indonesian language was by Wismar Djaulung Saragih Sumbayak, who had been baptised by Theis in 1910. Wismar also authored the first Simalungun dictionary, and successfully campaigned for teaching in schools to be conducted in Simalungun rather than Toba. He also pushed for the use of traditional Simalungun clothes and music in the church. His efforts eventually led to the formation of the distinct [[Simalungun Protestant Christian Church]].

==Simalungun surnames==
[[File:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM Dak van een rumah bolon het huis van een Simalungun Batak raja en zijn familie TMnr 20018513.jpg|thumbnail|right|Roof of a ''rumah bolon'', the house of a Simalungun Batak raja and his family.]]
Simalungun people belong to one of four surnames (clans). Each surname has sub-surnames, although individuals may choose to identify primarily by their surnames, rather than sub-surnames, in order to emphasize common kinship.

The four original surnames are:-&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Batara Sangti Simanjuntak|title=Sejarah Batak: sejarah dan kebudayaan|year=1978|publisher=Karl Sianipuar Company|oclc=865862245|page=151}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''NBA Slam Dunk Contest''' (officially known as the '''[[Verizon Communications|Verizon]] Slam Dunk''' for sponsorship reasons) is an annual [[National Basketball Association]] (NBA) competition held during the [[NBA All-Star Weekend]]. The contest was inaugurated by the [[American Basketball Association]] (ABA) at its [[1976 ABA All-Star Game|All-Star Game in 1976]] in [[Denver]], the same year the [[slam dunk]] was legalized in the [[NCAA]]. As a result of the [[ABA–NBA merger]] later that year there would not be another slam dunk contest at the professional level until 1984. The contest has adopted several formats over the years, including, until 2014, the use of fan voting, via  text-messaging, to determine the winner of the final round.

The very first slam dunk contest was won by [[Larry Nance|Larry Nance Sr.]] of the Suns at the 1984 [[NBA All-Star Game]]. The current champion of the NBA Dunk Contest is [[Donovan Mitchell]] of the [[Utah Jazz]].

==History==

===1976 ABA Slam Dunk Contest===
On January 27, 1976 at [[McNichols Sports Arena]] during halftime of the 1976 ABA All Star Game the first-ever Slam Dunk Contest was held, which was won by [[Julius Erving]] of the [[New York Nets]] over [[David Thompson (basketball)|David Thompson]] of the [[Denver Nuggets]], [[Artis Gilmore]] of the [[Kentucky Colonels]], and [[George Gervin]] and [[Larry Kenon]] of the [[San Antonio Spurs]]. There was a format each competitor had to follow in which they must attempt 5 dunks in a row under two minutes. One from a standing position, one from a distance of ten feet away from the basket (which is basically the bottom of the semi circle that surrounds the free throw line in the [[Key (basketball)|Key]]. The next 3 were freestyle positions, one coming in from the left side of the basket, one coming in from the right side of the basket and finally from either corner down the baseline to the basket. They were judged on artistic ability, imagination, body flow as well as fan response.

Artis Gilmore went first followed by George Gervin, Larry Kenon, David Thompson and finally Julius Erving. George Gervin and David Thompson both missed a dunk during their routines which counted as a zero (scores were not announced to the audience). David Thompson did a 360 degree dunk to finish his routine. All competitors had to perform a dunk from 10 feet, but Julius Erving started marking his steps from the free throw line (15 feet away). He then completed a dunk from the free throw line.

===1976–1977 NBA Slam Dunk Contest===
This was a season long event [http://www.nba.com/pacers/news/hillman_dunkers_050920.html] similar to 1977–1978 NBA Horse event. There were 22 competitors throughout the event (nearly one for each team at the time), including future Hall of Famers [[Kareem Abdul-Jabbar]], [[David Thompson (basketball)|David Thompson]], [[Alex English]], [[Moses Malone]], [[George Gervin]], and [[Elvin Hayes]] and took place in multiple venues throughout the season. [[Darnell Hillman]] was named the winner that season, beating out the [[Golden State Warriors]]' [[Larry McNeill]] in the championship round on June 5, 1977 in Portland.[http://www.truthaboutit.net/2011/01/javale-mcgee-elvin-hayes-and-the-lost-nba-dunk-contest-from-1976-77-washington-bullets-wizards.html]

===1980s===
The NBA reintroduced the Slam Dunk Contest in [[1983–84 NBA season|1984]] at its birthplace in Denver. Phoenix's [[Larry Nance]] defeated the original Dunk contest winner [[Julius Erving]] in the final round. [[Dominique Wilkins]] won the contest the following year, but in 1986 his [[Atlanta Hawks]] teammate [[Spud Webb]] made history when he defeated Wilkins in the final, preventing him from retaining his title. Standing a mere 5 feet 7&amp;nbsp;inches tall, Webb became the shortest player ever to win the contest, a distinction that he still holds.  Chicago's [[Michael Jordan]] won back-to-back dunk contest victories in 1987 and in 1988.  His victory over Wilkins in 1988 in Chicago finished with a perfect 50 dunk from the free-throw line for his third dunk to win the contest.  However, the announcers did note that Wilkins was given abnormally low score for his breathtaking third dunk, a 45, allowing Jordan to win it by 2 with his perfect 50. To this day, the allegations of "''home cooking''" still float around surrounding the event (it was held on Jordan's home court; one of the judges was former [[Chicago Bears]] star [[Gale Sayers]]; and another judge, former NBA star [[Tom Hawkins (basketball)|Tom Hawkins]], is a Chicago native) and is considered arguably the most controversial of the slam dunk competitions.  The following year in Houston, New York's [[Kenny Walker|Kenny "Sky" Walker]], a last-minute replacement whose father died just days beforehand, upset Portland's [[Clyde Drexler]], the hometown favorite and Houston native who was seen as the favorite, being that Michael Jordan and Dominique Wilkins were not competing. 1986 champ Spud Webb finished 3rd, while [[Shelton Jones]] finished 4th. Though Jordan &amp; Wilkins still played in the All-Star Game, Jordan chose not to compete due to a minor injury, and Wilkins did not compete in the competition due to a hand injury.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Walker Wins One for His Father|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/02/12/sports/walker-wins-one-for-his-father.html|accessdate=25 June 2015|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=12 February 1989}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1990s===
In 1990, [[Dominique Wilkins]] of the [[Atlanta Hawks]] edged out [[Kenny Smith]] of the [[Sacramento Kings]] to win his second Slam Dunk Contest (first won in 1985 over [[Michael Jordan]]). [[Kenny Smith]] scored high points for originality with his signature dunk – he started by turning his back to the basket, bouncing the ball backward between his legs and off the backboard, then turning and grabbing it in the air and reverse dunking it. After 1990, interest in the Slam Dunk Contest began to wane and lasted throughout the 1990s. Initially, it was because many players lost interest in competing; some cited concerns of injuries, while others felt that the full repertoire of humanly possible dunks had already been exhausted.{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}} With most of the superstars – Jordan, Wilkins, Drexler, etc. – choosing not to participate, lesser-known players began to compete, leading to either watered-down competitions or surprises. Fans{{Who|date=February 2012}} complained that players were beginning to win contests with boring or unoriginal dunks (witness the relatively forgettable early-'90s wins by the likes of [[Cedric Ceballos]] and [[Brent Barry]]). [[Harold Miner]] was a standout in 1993, winning the contest with a reverse power dunk, reaching between his legs and down to his feet in mid-air before sending the ball down. In 1994 and 1997 respectively, [[Isaiah Rider]] and [[Kobe Bryant]] won the contest.  Rider would win with a spectacular, between-the-legs dunk, reminiscent of the [[Orlando Woolridge]] effort in the 1984 contest, but wasn't able to repeat in 1995, missing the same dunk on several tries, opening the way for Miner to grab his second slam dunk title in three years. In 1998, the Slam Dunk Contest was replaced with the WNBA-NBA 2Ball Contest.  In 1999, there was no All-Star Game due to the NBA lockout.

===2000s===
After a one-All Star Weekend layoff (the NBA did not have an All Star Weekend during the labor-shortened 1999 season), the NBA decided to bring the Slam Dunk Contest back for the [[1999–2000 NBA season|2000]] All-Star Weekend in [[Oakland, California]]. It would prove to be one of the most electrifying dunk contests in the league's history,{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}} featuring a great showdown between eventual winner [[Vince Carter]] of the [[Toronto Raptors]], his cousin and then-teammate [[Tracy McGrady]], and the [[Houston Rockets]]' [[Steve Francis]]. Carter won after performing a number of very impressive dunks, including two reverse 360 windmills, a honey dip, and a between-the-legs dunk off a bounced alley-oop from McGrady. The next four contests did not feature superstars like Carter and Bryant, and despite innovative efforts by the likes of [[Desmond Mason]] and [[Jason Richardson]], the lack of A-list superstars willing to participate hurt the appeal of the contest.

In [[2004–05 NBA season|2005]], the Slam Dunk Contest returned to its birthplace in Denver. With the spectacular dunks of prior contests, there was buzz{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}} that the dunk competition could regain the popularity it had in the 1980s. The [[Phoenix Suns]]' [[Amar'e Stoudemire]] alley-ooping 360 off a soccer-style header from teammate [[Steve Nash]]; [[J. R. Smith]] putting it around his back and dunking, and the new champion, [[Josh Smith]] alley-ooping over Kenyon Martin all wowed the crowd with their maneuvers. With the change in the rules requiring an additional teammate starting in the second round, they proved there were indeed many ways to dunk a basketball that had not been done before. Amar'e Stoudemire received rave reviews, as did Smith when he did a tribute dunk to [[Dominique Wilkins]] while donning Wilkins' jersey.

Again in 2006, the Dunk Contest in [[Houston]] revitalized the interests of audiences as 5'9" [[Nate Robinson]] of the [[New York Knicks]] took the title with a great dunk-off. One of his most exciting dunks was a high-flying dunk over former Slam Dunk Contest winner, 5'7" [[Spud Webb]]. The 2006 Slam Dunk Contest was also the first Dunk Contest in history to have a "Dunk Off", the equivalent to a Dunk Contest overtime, between Knicks point guard Nate Robinson and shooting guard [[Andre Iguodala]] of the [[Philadelphia 76ers]]. Many fans argue that Iguodala should have won the contest, as it took Robinson fourteen attempts before finally completing his dunk. Iguodala pulled off a dunk where he started out of bounds from the right side of the baseline while teammate [[Allen Iverson]] bounced the ball off the back of the right side of the backboard. Iguodala caught the ball in mid-air behind the backboard, spun around to the other side while ducking his head (to avoid colliding with the backboard) and dunked it with his right hand.

On February 17, 2007, the contest was held in [[Las Vegas]]. Judges for the event were all past winners: [[Michael Jordan]], [[Dominique Wilkins]], [[Kobe Bryant]], [[Julius Erving]], and [[Vince Carter]]. The title was taken by the [[Boston Celtics]]' [[Gerald Green]], who, among other dunks, jumped over reigning champ [[Nate Robinson]] while covering his face – a homage to 1991 winner, [[Dee Brown (basketball, born 1968)|Dee Brown]], whose jersey Green had worn. He also scored a perfect fifty with his last slam, a windmill over a table. Other noteworthy dunks include a dunk by Orlando Magic center [[Dwight Howard]], who, while making his dunk, stuck a sticker with his smiling face on the backboard a reported 12'6" from the ground, two and a half feet beyond the regulation NBA rim.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Gardner|first=Matthew|title=Howard's Sticker Dunk Doesn’t Impress Judges|url=http://www.nba.com/magic/news/Howardrsquos_Sticker_Dunk_Do-211252-800.html|publisher=NBA|accessdate=5 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 16, 2008, the contest was held in [[New Orleans]]. Judges for the event included [[Darryl Dawkins]], [[Dominique Wilkins]], [[Karl Malone]], [[Julius Erving]], and [[Magic Johnson]]. The title was taken by [[Orlando Magic]] center Dwight Howard. Howard's most noteworthy dunk came during the first round, his second dunk overall, when he took off his jersey to reveal a [[Superman]] shirt and cape.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.espn.com/nba/allstar2008/news/story?id=3249672|title=Howard wins Slam Dunk title|date=17 February 2008|website=ESPN.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; With teammate [[Jameer Nelson]]'s assistance he would make a leaping dunk from just in front of the free-throw line after a running start, throwing the ball through the rim from a few feet away.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EO3c8EaxsxQ&amp;feature=player_detailpage |title=Dwight Howard takes flight on All-Star Saturday Night! |publisher= |date= |accessdate=2012-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other noteworthy dunks included the first round slam by [[Jamario Moon]] while the previous year's winner, [[Gerald Green]], relied heavily on theatrics by blowing out a cupcake with a birthday candle on the rim before dunking (a jam he termed "The Birthday Cake"). For the first time ever, fan voting determined the outcome of the final round of the contest; Howard beat Green for the trophy by claiming 78% of the fans' votes.

[[Nate Robinson]] won the 2009 contest on February 14 in Phoenix, Arizona. The 5'9" guard dressed all in green as "Krypto-Nate" (a [[portmanteau]] of 'Nate' and [[Kryptonite]]) and jumped over 6'11" [[Dwight Howard]] characterized as Superman. He defeated Howard in the finals by a fan vote of 52–48 percent. [[J. R. Smith]] and [[Rudy Fernández (basketball)|Rudy Fernández]] also competed.

===2010s===
[[Nate Robinson]] won the 2010 contest on February 13 in [[Dallas]], becoming the first 3-time Slam Dunk champion. Robinson took on [[Shannon Brown]] of the [[Los Angeles Lakers]], [[Gerald Wallace]] of the [[Charlotte Bobcats]], and [[DeMar DeRozan]] of the [[Toronto Raptors]]. DeRozan earned his spot in the competition by defeating [[Los Angeles Clippers]] guard [[Eric Gordon]] in the inaugural Sprite Slam Dunk-In held the night before the actual dunk contest. Robinson and DeRozan advanced to the final round, where Robinson's double-pump reverse dunk helped seal a 51% to 49% victory.

[[Blake Griffin]] won the 2011 slam dunk contest by jumping and dunking over the hood of a [[Kia Motors|Kia]] sedan on February 19 in Los Angeles. [[JaVale McGee]] of the [[Washington Wizards]], [[DeMar DeRozan]] of the [[Toronto Raptors]], and [[Serge Ibaka]] of the [[Oklahoma City Thunder]] all competed against Griffin. Griffin and McGee advanced to the final round, where Griffin stole the show, winning the contest with 68% of the vote.

[[Jeremy Evans]] won the 2012 Sprite Slam Dunk Contest by performing a dunk over [[Kevin Hart]] on February 25 in Orlando, Florida with 29% of the votes. Joining Evans were [[Chase Budinger]] of the [[Houston Rockets]], [[Paul George]] of the [[Indiana Pacers]], and [[Derrick Williams (basketball)|Derrick Williams]] of the [[Minnesota Timberwolves]]. While George awed the crowd with a dunk with the lights turned off, Evans had perhaps the dunk of the contest by jumping teammate [[Gordon Hayward]], catching two balls from Hayward, and dunking it.

[[Terrence Ross]] won the 2013 Sprite Slam Dunk Contest after a tomahawk dunk in tribute to former [[Toronto Raptors]] player [[Vince Carter]], as well as a between-the-legs dunk performed while jumping over a ball boy. Ross took on [[Jeremy Evans]] of the [[Utah Jazz]], [[Eric Bledsoe]] of the [[Los Angeles Clippers]], [[Kenneth Faried]] of the [[Denver Nuggets]], [[Gerald Green]] of the [[Indiana Pacers]], and [[James White (basketball)|James White]] of the [[New York Knicks]]. Evans advanced to the final round to defend his title of slam dunk champion, but was thwarted by Ross. Ross carried the momentum of his near-perfect first round, in which he scored a 99 out of a possible 100, with a stellar final round. Ross won the competition decisively, earning 58% of the vote.

Team East, composed of dunkers [[Paul George]], defending champion [[Terrence Ross]], and [[John Wall (basketball)|John Wall]] won the 2014 Sprite Slam Dunk Contest in commanding fashion. Under the new team format, they dominated the Freestyle Round, capping it off with a pass off the backboard from Ross to Wall, then off the shot clock from Wall to George for the finish. In the Battle Round, Ross defeated [[Damian Lillard]] with a through the legs dunk from rapper [[Drake (musician)|Drake]], George took down [[Harrison Barnes]] with a 360-degree, through the legs finish, and Wall defeated [[Ben McLemore]] by jumping over the Wizards' mascot G-Man and throwing down a reverse on the first try. Though Team East are the official winners, Wall was voted by fans as the Dunker of the Night.

To the delight of NBA fans, the 2015 contest was changed back to  its original format, as the Freestyle Round as well as the teams were taken out.  The 4 dunkers competing were all up-and-coming players: The Bucks' [[Giannis Antetokounmpo]], the Timberwolves' [[Zach LaVine]], the Magic's [[Victor Oladipo]], and the Nets' [[Mason Plumlee]].  LaVine took home the hardware with dunks that included a between-the-legs reverse, a behind-the-back slam in which he caught it in midair, a between-the-legs lefthanded dunk, and finished with a between-the-legs dunk as he caught it off the pole behind the backboard. Similar to Howard with Superman, LaVine did his first dunk with a cultural homage, wearing Michael Jordan's jersey from ''[[Space Jam]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://sports.yahoo.com/blogs/nba-ball-dont-lie/zach-lavine-explodes-on-national-stage--wins-2015-sprite-slam-dunk-042937569.html|title=Zach LaVine explodes on national stage, wins 2015 Sprite Slam Dunk|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many people, including 2010 winner [[Nate Robinson]], thought that the 2011 contest was rigged to allow up-and-coming star [[Blake Griffin]] to win and that runner-up [[JaVale McGee]] deserved to win.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.celticslife.com/2011/02/everything-so-convenient-for-nba-in.html |title=Everything so convenient for NBA in dunk contest. &amp;#124; CelticsLife.com – Boston Celtics Fan Site, Blog, T-shirts |publisher=CelticsLife.com |date=February 20, 2011 |accessdate=2012-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bleacherreport.com/articles/615073-blake-griffin-won-the-nba-dunk-contest-too-bad-it-was-fixed |title=Blake Griffin Won the NBA Dunk Contest: Too Bad It Was Fixed |publisher=Bleacher Report |date=February 20, 2011 |accessdate=2012-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nbafanvoice.com/2011/02/21/slam-dunk-show/ |title=Slam Dunk Contest Rigged? |publisher=NBA Fan Voice |date=February 21, 2011 |accessdate=2012-08-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120905190312/http://www.nbafanvoice.com/2011/02/21/slam-dunk-show/ |archivedate=September 5, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://probasketballtalk.nbcsports.com/2011/01/09/nate-robinson-thinks-the-dunk-contest-is-rigged/ |title=Nate Robinson thinks the dunk contest is rigged|publisher=Probasketballtalk.nbcsports.com |date= |accessdate=2012-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was even disputed if Griffin even legitimately qualified for the finals since his final dunk got a perfect score but was basically a copy of DeMar DeRozan's first dunk with a lower [[degree of difficulty]]. [[Ben Maller]] of Fox Sports Radio reported that a media advisory sent out by the NBA over an hour before the 2011 Slam Dunk Contest began already referring to Blake Griffin as the winner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://benmaller.com/2011/02/blake-griffin-couldnt-lose-slam-dunk-contest/ |title=Blake Griffin COULDN’T lose Slam Dunk contest? |publisher=Ben Maller |date=February 28, 2011 |accessdate=2012-08-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120322103753/http://benmaller.com/2011/02/blake-griffin-couldnt-lose-slam-dunk-contest/ |archivedate=March 22, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
Historically, the dunk contest drew some mild criticisms. One is that players who often compete in these contests are seen as dunkers only (with the obvious exceptions of [[Michael Jordan]], [[Kobe Bryant]], and [[Julius Erving]]), which is why notable high flying athletes like [[Shawn Marion]] and [[LeBron James]] have sometimes refused to participate.{{fact|date=May 2017}} High-profile players such as  [[Dwyane Wade]] and [[Charles Barkley]] have also declined to participate citing it as an unnecessary risk to injury.{{fact|date=May 2017}} In the 2000 NBA Slam Dunk Contest, [[Tracy McGrady]] injured his wrist while performing a dunk.{{fact|date=May 2017}} Also in the 1995 NBA Slam Dunk Contest, [[Tony Dumas]] hurt his knee while performing his "Texas Twister" dunk.{{fact|date=May 2017}} Although a longtime critic, [[LeBron James]] said he would perform in the 2010 Slam Dunk Contest. This decision was made after watching the 2009 dunk contest when [[Dwight Howard]] and [[Nate Robinson]] went at it. However, he withdrew his statement once the All-Star Weekend came around.{{fact|date=May 2017}}

The 2006 NBA Slam Dunk Competition between Nate Robinson and [[Andre Iguodala]] drew much criticism because players were not penalized for missing a dunk attempt. Consequently, Robinson attempted a single dunk 14 times before completing it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/11435250/ |title=5-foot-9 Robinson soars to Slam Dunk title |publisher=MSNBC |date=February 19, 2006 |accessdate=2012-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to the 2007 competition, the NBA changed a few rules to prevent excessive dunk attempts.  Each participant has two minutes to complete their dunk.  At the end of the two minutes allotted, they then have their number of dunk attempts limited to two.

==Records==
*[[Zach LaVine]] posted the highest score in any round with 200 in the 2016 final round, as well as the best overall score with 299.0 points.
*27 players have scored at least one perfect 50 on an individual dunk: [[Julius Erving]], [[Terence Stansbury]], [[Michael Jordan]], [[Dominique Wilkins]], [[Gerald Wilkins]], [[Spud Webb]], [[Jerome Kersey]], [[Cedric Ceballos]], [[Vince Carter]], [[Steve Francis]], [[Tracy McGrady]], [[Jason Richardson]], [[Desmond Mason]], [[Fred Jones (basketball)|Fred Jones]], [[Josh Smith]], [[Amar'e Stoudemire]], [[Andre Iguodala]], [[Nate Robinson]], [[Gerald Green]], [[Dwight Howard]], [[DeMar DeRozan]], [[JaVale McGee]], [[Terrence Ross]], [[Victor Oladipo]], [[Zach LaVine]], [[Aaron Gordon]], [[Glenn Robinson III]], and [[Donovan Mitchell]]. [[Zach LaVine]] holds the record with the most perfect 50s, with seven; [[Michael Jordan]] has the second most with six, followed by [[Dominique Wilkins]] and [[Jason Richardson]] with five each. From 1989 to 1995, when scoring went by tenths of points, there was only one perfect 50 (Ceballos).
*[[Michael Jordan]], [[Jason Richardson]],  [[Nate Robinson]], and [[Zach LaVine]] are the only players to win the NBA Slam Dunk Contest back-to-back. Michael Jordan, [[Kobe Bryant]] and [[Brent Barry]] are the only players to have won an NBA championship and a slam dunk championship.
*Kobe Bryant is the youngest player to win the slam dunk contest at the age of 18.
*At 5'7", Spud Webb is the shortest player to win the NBA slam dunk contest (Nate Robinson is 5'9"). Ralph Sampson, at 7'4", is the tallest player to compete in the dunk contest, while Dwight Howard is the tallest winner, at 6'11".
* Nate Robinson is the only player to win the contest three times.
*The 2006 NBA Slam Dunk Competition between Nate Robinson and [[Andre Iguodala]] was the first time that the competition had to go into a sudden-death dunk-off.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Matt Wong |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nba/allstar2006/news/story?id=2335818 |title=Robinson wins dunkfest amid controversy – NBA – ESPN |publisher=Sports.espn.go.com |date=February 21, 2006 |accessdate=2012-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*In 1996, [[Greg Minor]] of the Boston Celtics received the lowest individual score for a single dunk, with a 2.0 for a missed first attempt.

A '''taijitu''' ({{lang-zh|t=太極圖|s=太极图|p=tàijítú|w=t'ai⁴chi²t'u²}})  is a [[Character (symbol)|symbol or diagram]] ({{lang|zh|图}} ''tú'') in [[Chinese philosophy]] representing [[Taiji (philosophy)|Taiji]] ({{lang|zh|太极}} ''tàijí'' "great pole" or "supreme ultimate") representing both its monist (''[[Wuji (philosophy)|wuji]]'') and its dualist ([[yin and yang]]) aspects. Such a diagram was first introduced by  [[Song Dynasty]] [[Neo-Confucianism|philosopher]] [[Zhou Dunyi]] (周敦頤 1017–1073) in his ''Taijitu shuo'' 太極圖說.

The modern [[Taoism|Taoist]] canon, compiled during the [[Ming China|Ming era]], has at least half a dozen variants of such ''taijitu''. The two most similar are the "Taiji [[Xiantiandao|Primal Heaven]]" (太極先天圖 ''tàijí  xiāntiān tú'') and the "[[Wuji (philosophy)|wuji]]" (無極圖 ''wújí tú'') diagrams, both of which have been extensively studied during the Qing period for their possible connection with Zhou Dunyi's ''taijitu''.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph A. Adler, ''Reconstructing the Confucian Dao: Zhu Xi's Appropriation of Zhou Dunyi'',  SUNY Press, 2014,
[https://books.google.com/books?id=09ouAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA153 p. 153]&lt;/ref&gt;

Ming period author [[Lai Zhide]] (1525–1604) simplified the ''taijitu'' to a design of two interlocking spirals. In the Ming era, the combination of the two interlocking spirals of the ''taijitu'' with two black-and-white dots superimposed on them became identified with the ''[[Yellow River Map|He tu]]'' or "Yellow River diagram" (河圖). This version was reported in Western literature of the late 19th century as the "Great Monad",&lt;ref&gt;Labelled "The Great Monad" by [[Hampden Coit DuBose]], ''The Dragon, Image, and Demon: Or, The Three Religions of China; Confucianism, Buddhism, and Taoism'' (1887), [https://archive.org/stream/dragonimageandd00bosegoog#page/n359/mode/2up p. 357]&lt;/ref&gt; and has been widely popularised in Western popular culture as the "yin-yang symbol" since the 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;"The 'River Diagram' is the pattern of black-and-white dots which appears superimposed on the interlocking spirals [...] Those spirals alone form the ''Taiji tu'' or 'Diagram of the Supreme Ultimate', often known in English since the 1960s as the 'yin-yang symbol'.) These dots were believed to be collated with the eight trigrams, and hence with the concepts of roundness and of the heavens, while the equally numinous 'Luo River Writing' was a pattern of dots accosiated with the number nine, with squareness and with the earth."
Craig Clunas, ''Pictures and Visuality in Early Modern China'' (1997), [https://books.google.com/books?id=Q06pemllwx0C&amp;pg=PA107  p. 107].
&lt;/ref&gt; The contemporary Chinese term for the modern symbol is {{lang|zh|太极兩儀图}} "two-part Taiji diagram".

[[Unicode]] features the "yin-yang symbol" in the [[Miscellaneous Symbols]] block, at code point U+262F  (YIN YANG ☯). The related "double body symbol" is included at U+0FCA  (TIBETAN SYMBOL NOR BU NYIS -KHYIL ࿊), in the [[Tibetan alphabet|Tibetan]] block.
The [[Soyombo symbol]], that includes a taijitu, is available in Unicode as U+11A9E, 𑪞, U+11A9F, 𑪟, and U+11AA0, 𑪠.

Ornamental patterns with visual similarity to the "yin-yang symbol" are found in archaeological artefacts of [[European prehistory]]; such designs are sometimes descriptively dubbed "yin yang symbols" in archaeological literature by modern scholars.&lt;ref name="Celtic yin yang"&gt;{{harvnb|Peyre|1982|pp=62–64, 82 (pl.

== Structure ==
[[File:ZhoushiTaijitu.png|thumb|right|Ming-era Daoist ''Taijitu'']]
The ''taijitu'' consists of five parts. Strictly speaking, the "yin and yang symbol", itself popularly called ''taijitu'', represents the second of these five parts of the diagram.

*At the top, an empty circle depicts the absolute (''[[Wuji (philosophy)|Wuji]]'')
*A second circle represents the Taiji as harboring Dualism, [[yin and yang]], represented by filling the circle in a black-and-white pattern. In some diagrams, there is a smaller empty circle at the center of this, representing Emptiness as the foundation of duality.
*Below this second circle is a five-part diagram representing the Five Agents (''[[Wu Xing|Wuxing]]''), representing a further stage in the differentiation of Unity into Multiplicity. The Five Agents are connected by lines indicating their proper sequence,  Wood (木) → Fire (火) → Earth (土) → Metal (金) → Water (水).
*The circle below the Five Agents represents the conjunction of Heaven and Earth, which in turn gives rise to the "ten thousand things". This stage is also represented by the Eight Trigrams (''[[Bagua]]'').
*The final circle represents the state of multiplicity, glossed  "The ten thousand things are born by transformation" (萬物化生; modern 化生万物)

== History ==
{{See also|Taiji (philosophy)|Yin and yang}}
The term ''taijitu'' in modern Chinese is commonly used to mean the simple "divided circle" form ([[File:Taijitu - Small (CW).svg|18px]]), but it may refer to any of several schematic diagrams that contain at least one circle with an inner pattern of [[symmetry]] representing [[yin and yang]].

=== Song era ===
While the concept of [[yin and yang]] dates to Chinese antiquity,&lt;ref&gt;in the ''[[I Ching]]'', originally a divination manual of the [[Western Zhou]] period (c. 1000–750 BC),  yin and yang are represented by broken and solid lines: yin is broken (⚋) and yang is solid (⚊).&lt;/ref&gt;
the interest in "diagrams" (圖 ''tú'') is an intellectual fashion of [[Neo-Confucianism]] during the [[Song China|Song period]] (11th century), and it declined again
in the Ming period, by the 16th century.&lt;ref name="Adler152"&gt;Joseph A. Adler, ''Reconstructing the Confucian Dao: Zhu Xi's Appropriation of Zhou Dunyi'',  SUNY Press, 2014,
[https://books.google.com/books?id=09ouAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA152 p. 152]&lt;/ref&gt;

The original description of a ''taijitu'' is due to Song era philosopher [[Zhou Dunyi]] (1017–1073), author of the ''Taijitu shuo'' {{lang|zh|太極圖說}} "Explanation of the Diagram of the Supreme Ultimate", which became the cornerstone of [[Neo-Confucianist]] cosmology. His brief text synthesized aspects of [[Chinese Buddhism]] and Taoism with [[metaphysics|metaphysical]] discussions in the ''[[Yijing]]''.

Zhou's key terms [[Wuji (philosophy)|Wuji]] and [[Taiji (philosophy)|Taiji]] appear in the opening line {{lang|zh|無極而太極}}, which Adler notes could also be translated "The Supreme Polarity that is Non-Polar".
&lt;blockquote&gt;Non-polar (''wuji'') and yet Supreme Polarity (''taiji'')! The Supreme Polarity in activity generates ''yang''; yet at the limit of activity it is still. In stillness it generates ''yin''; yet at the limit of stillness it is also active. Activity and stillness alternate; each is the basis of the other. In distinguishing ''yin'' and ''yang'', the Two Modes are thereby established. The alternation and combination of ''yang'' and ''yin'' generate water, fire, wood, metal, and earth. With these five [phases of] ''qi'' harmoniously arranged, the Four Seasons proceed through them. The Five Phases are simply ''yin'' and ''yang''; ''yin'' and ''yang'' are simply the Supreme Polarity; the Supreme Polarity is fundamentally Non-polar. [Yet] in the generation of the Five Phases, each one has its nature.&lt;ref&gt;Adler, Joseph A. (1999). [http://www2.kenyon.edu/Depts/Religion/Fac/Adler/Writings/Chou.htm "Zhou Dunyi: The Metaphysics and Practice of Sagehood"], in ''Sources of Chinese Tradition'', William Theodore De Bary and Irene Bloom, eds. 2nd ed., 2 vols. Columbia University Press. pp. 673–674.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Instead of usual ''Taiji'' translations "Supreme Ultimate" or "Supreme Pole", Adler uses "Supreme Polarity" (see Robinet 1990) because [[Zhu Xi]] describes it as the alternating principle of [[yin and yang|''yin'' and ''yang'']], and ...
&lt;blockquote&gt;insists that ''taiji'' is not a thing (hence "Supreme Pole" will not do). Thus, for both Zhou and Zhu, ''taiji'' is the ''yin-yang'' principle of bipolarity, which is the most fundamental ordering principle, the cosmic "first principle." ''Wuji'' as "non-polar" follows from this. &lt;/blockquote&gt;

Since the 12th century, there has been a vigorous discussion in Chinese philosophy regarding the ultimate origin of Zhou Dunyi's diagram.
[[Zhu Xi]] (12th century) insists that Zhou Dunyi had composed the diagram himself, against the prevailing view that he had received it from Daoist sources.
Zhu Xi could not accept a Daoist origin of the design, because it would have undermined the claim of uniqueness attached to the Neo-Confucian concept of ''dao''.&lt;ref name="Adler152"/&gt;

While [[Zhou Dunyi]] (1017–1073) popularized the circular diagram,&lt;ref name="Yao2000"&gt;{{cite book|author=Xinzhong Yao|title=An introduction to Confucianism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tAE2OJ9bPG0C&amp;pg=PA98|accessdate=29 October 2011|date=13 February 2000|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-64430-3|pages=98–}}&lt;/ref&gt; the introduction of "swirling" patterns first appears in the Ming period.

Zhao Huiqian (趙撝謙, 1351–1395) was the first to introduce the "swirling" variant of the ''taijitu'' in his ''Liushu benyi'' (六書本義, 1370s).
The diagram is combined with the eight trigrams (''[[bagua]]'') and called the "River Chart spontaneously generated by Heaven and Earth".
By the end of the Ming period, this diagram had become a widespread representation of [[Chinese cosmology]].&lt;ref&gt;François Louis,
'The Genesis of an Icon: The "Taiji" Diagram's Early History', ''Harvard Journal of Asiatic Studies'' 63.11 (June 2003),  145–196.&lt;/ref&gt;
The dots were introduced in the later Ming period (replacing the droplet-shapes used earlier, in the 16th century) and are encountered more frequently in the [[Qing dynasty|Qing period]].&lt;ref&gt;Louis (2003) has diagrams with dots dated to 1623 (p. 187) and 1688 (p. 146, p. 190).&lt;/ref&gt; The dots represent the seed of yin within yang and the seed of yang within yin; the idea that neither can exist without the other. 

Lai Zhide's design is similar to the ''[[Gankyil|gakyil]]'' (''dga' 'khyil'' or "wheel of joy") symbols of [[Tibetan Buddhism]];
but while the Tibetan designs have three or four swirls (representing the [[Three Jewels]] or the [[Four Noble Truths]], i.e. as a [[triskele]] and a [[tetraskelion]] design), Lai Zhide's taijitu has two swirls, terminating in a central circle.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Beer, ''The Handbook of Tibetan Buddhist Symbols'', 2003, [https://books.google.com/books?id=-3804Ud9-4IC&amp;pg=PA209#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p. 209]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Modern yin-yang symbol ==
The Ming-era design of the taijitu of two interlocking spirals has been reported as "yin-yang symbol" in the first half of the 20th century.
The [[flag of South Korea]], originally introduced as the flag of [[Joseon]] era Korea in 1882, shows this symbol in red and blue. This was a modernisation of the older (early 19th century) form of the [[Bat Quai Do]] used as the Joseon royal standard.

Since the 1960s, "yin-yang symbol" is most widely applied to the ''He tu'' symbol which combines the two interlocking spirals with two dots.
In the standard form of the contemporary "yin-yang symbol", one draws on the [[diameter]] of a [[circle]] two non-overlapping circles each of which has a diameter equal to the [[radius]] of the outer circle. One keeps the line that forms an "S", and one erases or obscures the other line.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Peyre|1982|pp=62f.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The design is also described{{according to whom|date=December 2015}}{{year needed|date=December 2015}} "pair of fishes nestling head to tail against each other".&lt;ref name="Robinet 2008, 934"&gt;{{harvnb|Robinet|2008|p=934}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Soyombo symbol]] of Mongolia may be prior to 1686.
It combines several abstract shapes, including a ''Taiji'' symbol illustrating the mutual complement of man and woman. In socialist times, it was alternatively interpreted as two fish symbolizing vigilance, because fish never close their eyes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Pu̇revsambuu |first1=G. |title=Mongolia |location=Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia |publisher=[[Montsame]] |year=2006 |isbn=99929-0-627-8 |page=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The modern  symbol has  also been widely used in martial arts, particularly [[t'ai chi ch'uan]] (Taijiquan),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

In this context, it is generally used to represent the interplay between [[Hard and soft (martial arts)|hard and soft techniques]].

The dots in the modern "yin-yang symbol" have been given the additional interpretation of "intense interaction" between the complementary principles.
&lt;ref&gt;"the yin/yang symbol so familiar to us contains a white dot amid the black and a black dot amid the white to indicate that these principles interact intensely." Norman R. Kraft, ''Ogdoadic Magick'', Weiser Books, 1969, p. 23.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Adventures''''' is a comic book series published from August [[1988 in comics|1988]] to October [[1995 in comics|1995]] by [[Archie Comics]]. It is mainly based on the stories of the [[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles|mutant turtles]] [[Donatello (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles)|Donatello]], [[Leonardo (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles)|Leonardo]], [[Michelangelo (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles)|Michaelangelo]], [[Raphael (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles)|Raphael]], and their rat sensei [[Splinter (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles)|Splinter]]. It is set in a [[parallel universe (fiction)|separate reality]] from other TMNT stories.

The initial storylines were close adaptations of the [[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (1987 TV series)|TMNT 1987 TV series]], but by the fifth issue the creators handed the series over to [[Ryan Brown (comics)|Ryan Brown]] and [[Stephen Murphy (comics)|Stephen Murphy]]. In their hands the comic immediately diverged from the cartoon series into unique new story arcs, often incorporating social, environmentalist, and animal-rights themes. It also introduced several new characters of various races and backgrounds, including humans, mutants, aliens, and other [[anthropomorphism|anthropomorphic]] creatures. Additionally, the series added new layers to established players such as [[April O'Neil]], who began training with a katana, and the [[Shredder (TMNT)|Shredder]], who gradually revealed a sense of honor. The stories were often seen as 'deeper' and more 'serious' than the cartoon. As the new tales and characters were explored, original antagonists [[Krang]], [[Bebop and Rocksteady]] were eventually phased out early, making later appearances during stories involving alien worlds. Shredder would remain a recurring adversary.

The series ran for 72 issues; in addition, there were numerous annuals, specials and miniseries. In celebration of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles' 25th Anniversary, Archie Comics released a 104-page, full-color trade paperback collection of the first three issues in 2009, which was the adaptation of the original animated show's miniseries "Heroes in a Half Shell". Mirage Studios also printed a trade for the 25th anniversary, titled ''Future Tense'' reprinting ''[[Mighty Mutanimals]]'' #7 and ''TMNT Adventures'' #42–44 and #62–66 in July 2009. ''Future Tense'' was released to coincide with a planned release of the storyline from Mirage entitled ''Forever War'', but this eventually was canceled.

==Major story arcs==
'''Heroes in a Half Shell: Mini-series #1–3'''
:This mini-series adapts the first five episodes of the [[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (1987 TV series)|1987 TV series]]: "[[Turtle Tracks]]," "[[Enter the Shredder]]," "[[A Thing About Rats]]," "[[Hot Rodding Teenagers from Dimension X]]," and "[[Shredder &amp; Splintered]]." The Turtles team up with [[April O'Neil]] and confront [[Shredder (TMNT)|Shredder]], [[Krang]], [[Bebop and Rocksteady]] for the first time.

'''Issues #1–4'''
:Adapts the second season episodes of the animated series: "[[Return of the Shredder]]" and "[[The Incredible Shrinking Turtles]]." The Eye of Sarnath plot thread is developed in future issues, taking a different path than the animated cartoon.[[File:Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Adventures cover.jpg|right|140px|thumb|''TMNT Adventures'' #7]]

'''Issues #5–11'''
:Introduces fellow mutants, [[Ray Fillet|Man-Ray]], Leatherhead, Wingnut and Screwloose (who later form the [[Mighty Mutanimals]]). Also introduces concepts such as Cudley the Cowlick, Stump Asteroid and its intergalactic wrestling, the Turtles' wrestling costumes, and the polluted Earth in the future. After returning from Stump Asteroid, the Turtles meet Wingnut and Screwloose who seek revenge on Krang for destroying their home planet Huanu, and later confront the [[Rat King (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles)|Rat King]] for the first time. The Turtles battle the mutant villains, Wyrm and Scumbug, as well as the spy-turned-mutant, Chameleon. These issues offer decidedly different character origins and interpretations than the animated cartoon series.

'''Issues #12–13'''
:The Turtles are recruited by Cherubae to the planet of Hirobyl to battle the Malignoids, an alien, bug-like army sent out by [[Maligna]]. The battle is exploited by Stump Asteroid television. The Turtles are joined by Leatherhead, Wingnut and Screwloose, and other intergalactic wrestlers. Shredder, Krang, Bebop, and Rocksteady are connected with the alien threat, and Cherubae banishes them across the universe as punishment (Shredder to an Earth prison, Krang to the landfill planet Morbus, and Bebop and Rocksteady to an Eden World planet). Cherubae is revealed to be the sorceress who mutated Leatherhead as ''Mary Bones'', (her Earth disguise, Cherubae is her true form) and Leatherhead renounces his former life as helping Shredder for a while to become a wrestling idol on the Stump Asteroid, as he was seen as a monster on the Earth.

'''Issues #14–18'''
:The Turtles return to Earth just in time to rescue April O'Neil from poachers in the rain forest of Amazonas, Brazil. They are aided in their tropical adventures by Jagwar, Dreadmon, and Man-Ray. Upon their return to New York City, [[Mondo Gecko]] is introduced and joins the Turtles after he decides to break up with his girlfriend, Candy Fine, believing his mutation from human to human-lizard would make their relationship impossible to pursue.

'''Issues #19–20'''
:Evil businessman, Null, sends his alien lackeys, Scul and Bean, to attack the Turtles. The Turtles, Splinter, April, and Mondo Gecko are rescued by rats which Splinter summons to chew through their ropes. Having beaten Scul and Bean to a standstill, the aliens escape (but not before Raphael and Mondo can sneak aboard their spacecraft). Together with Man-Ray, Jagwar, Dreadmon, Leatherhead, Wingnut and Screwloose (the newly formed Mighty Mutanimals), Raph and Mondo defeat the alien warlord, Maligna (this arc overlaps with the events of ''Mighty Mutanimals'' mini-series #1-3). While Raphael is away fighting with the Mighty Mutanimals, the remaining Turtles meet Chu Hsi, a firefighter in Chinatown, New York City who is empowered with an ancient Warrior Dragon (popularly known as "Hothead") spirit after an old man tries to help him by throwing some mystic East Asian substance into a burning house where the firefighter tries to help a child. Together with their new ally they defeat a giant Foot robot, which is later revealed to have been a ruse by Shredder to get the Turtles to show themselves. The Warrior Dragon defeats the giant Foot robot by throwing it on the [[Statue of Liberty]].

'''Issues #21–25'''
:April O'Neil is revealed to have obtained competence with the katana sword under Splinter's instruction, and together they aid the Turtles in their battles against Vid Vicious and Shredder. Raphael returns to help defeat Shredder and aid his friends in the final fight with Krang, who has allied with Bellybomb to take possession of Shredder's body. The alien turtle Slash battles the Turtles for the first time. The Turtles remove Krang from Shredder's body and remind Shredder he owes them.

'''Issues #26–27'''
:This storyline explores [[Environmental policy|environmental political issues]]. In ''The Keeper'', an extraterrestrial spacecraft lands in [[Tibet]], and out comes ''Boss Salvage'' who abducts rare animals from the Earth, among them the Yeti T'Pau who searches help by Splinter. Boss Salvage also abducts the [[Loch Ness Monster]], [[Bigfoot]] and a merman. The reason is that he sees no future for them on the Earth because of pollution, but the Yeti persuades Boss Salvage that there still is hope, referring to all who are engaged in environmental politics. In ''In the Dark'', animals are mutated after illegal industrial pollution in [[Innsmouth, Massachusetts]] and April makes a report about illegal pollution. She calls the turtles, and they also get help from the local teenage girl ''Beth Ann''. The mutants want revenge on humanity, and poison the food with substances that put humans in a zombie-like state.

'''Mightnight Sun: Issues #28–30'''
:Continued from the April O'Neil backup stories in issues #24–27, the Turtles, Splinter, and April travel to [[Japan]] (by stowing away aboard an [[airplane]]) to rescue Fu Sheng and Chu Hsi (Chu Hsi is the human alter ego of The Warrior Dragon from issue #20) since Chu Hsi is kidnapped by ninjas in Chinatown, New York City and sent to [[Hiroshima]], Japan. They battle the samurai-masked villain Chien Khan (a fusion of the French word for 'dog' and the Turkish/Mongol term for 'great leader;' essentially "Dog King", since he is really an anthropomorphic dog) and his humanoid vixen warrior, [[Ninjara]]. Chien Khan forces Fu Sheng to summon the Warrior Dragon (if not he will use a knife to kill a young teenage girl, the street child Oyuki Mamisha who later becomes friend to April O' Neil) whom Chien Khan uses to brainwash with a witchcraft and destroy a nuclear power plant and set free an interdimensional demon. Chien Khan's recklessness regarding the nuclear plant enrages Ninjara, who decides to help the Turtles defeat him. Through meditation, Splinter is able to summon the ancient deities, [[Izanagi]] and [[Izanami]], who defeat the demon and free the Warrior Dragon from Chien Khan's witchcraft. The Turtles and Ninjara defeat Chien Khan and his men before he escapes in the confusion. Ninjara has a change of heart. She decides to accompany the Turtles and leave her criminal life behind.

'''Issues #31–36'''
:The heroes have further adventures in Japan, the Japanese culture and religion is studied, and gangsters who illegally make money on [[sumo wrestling]] are stopped. Raphael and Ninjara become close and April and Chu Hsi share a kiss. The Turtles, Splinter and Ninjara begin a long quest on land and sea heading west while the human characters fly back to New York City. In [[Tibet]] the heroes fight, with the help of a four armed [[anthropomorphism|anthropomorphic]] tiger named ''Katmandu'', to protect the incarnation of a [[lama]] (who happens to be Charlie Llama, an anthropomorphic [[llama]]) from the evil Chinese wizard Mang-Thrasha who kidnapped Charlie Llama from his Crystal Palace. The Whirling Dervishes and skeleton versions of them are fought. When the group finally arrive, Charlie Llama dies while a young woman gives birth to a child. Journeying through the deserts in the [[Middle East]], the group is attacked by Al'Falqa who believes they have stolen the [[Black Stone]] of [[Mecca]]. The sacred stone has actually been stolen by Shredder and a cat mutant, Verminator-X, from the future. The black stone is saved by the heroes before the villains disappear in a mysterious vortex-window. They also plan to kidnap Splinter, but give him back since Shredder owes the Turtles after they helped him escape from Krang.

'''Issue #37'''
:Cudley the Cowlick appears in the Middle East desert before the gang and proposes to take them to Stump Asteroid for another wrestling competition. If the Turtles participate Cudley will then drop everyone back on Earth at any location they desire, including New York. The Turtles agree, compete against each other, and Donatello emerges victorious and also defeats Cryin' Houn', here known as "El Mysterio".

'''Issues #38-39'''
:In a three issue [[fictional crossover|crossover]] with the Mighty Mutanimals (one of the issues was a ''[[Mighty Mutanimals]]'' comic), the Turtles fight the [[Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse]] and Null in Brazil.

'''Issues #40–41'''
:In issue #40, as he and his brothers sail home, Donatello is taken by a spirit to 1492 where he and his brothers encounter [[Christopher Columbus]] (who reached the Americas that year). The Turtles must defend the natives from Columbus' raids, but it all turns out to be in vain as the natives are either captured as slaves or die of disease. In #41, Raphael, while on a date with Ninjara to show her around New York City, is reminded of the Turtles battle against a mammoth mutant. The parts of the story in the present are drawn by Chris Allan, while the flashbacks are drawn by Ken Mitchroney, who drew the earlier issues of the comic in the era the flashbacks take place in.

'''The Future Shark Trilogy: Issues #42–44 '''
:The Turtles, Splinter and Ninjara are taken to the future by the future versions of Raph and Don. Don explains how in the future, some time after Splinter's death because of old age, [[global warming]] has melted the polar ice caps and left most of New York City under water. The present-day Turtles have already seen this earlier, after a mistake by Cudley the Cowlick after their first visit to the Stump Asteroid, and said it was a possible future. This created a rat problem but Don invented robot traps to eliminate the rats, much to the Rat King's chagrin. His robots won Don fame and wealth, which he used to fund his company Turtleco, along with a talented young cat mutant named Manx. Manx began to enhance himself as a [[cyborg]] named Verminator-X, obsessed with becoming immortal. Soon he and Don were archenemies.

:Verminator-X, the shark mutant Armaggon, and a time displaced version of the Shredder (from issue #36) broke into Turtleco, kidnapped the future Mike and Leo and stole Don's experimental time slip generator. When Raph attempted to stop them, his eye was blown out by one of Armaggon's missiles. Don built another machine in order to get reinforcements in the past. Armaggon works on powering the machine with [[Adolf Hitler]]'s brain, the Roswell Alien's bones and the white stone of mecca so he and his cohorts can rule all of space and time. Splinter, Ninjara and the six Turtles ambush the bad guys with a time slip, but Armaggon escapes, taking Leo as a hostage, into his machine with both Raphs and the present-day version of Don in pursuit. While the remaining Turtles battle Shredder and Verminator-X, the Rat King shows up to get his revenge on Future Don, using his powers to control Splinter. Luckily, the Turtles have a surprise ally in Merdude, tricking Verminator-X to fire his blaster, destroying the wall and letting sea water come in to free Future Leo and Mike which turns the tide in favor of the Turtles. Don and the two Raphs pursue Armaggon in a mystical swamp land some local fairies call Thantia. The two Raphs use their shared training to [[kick]] Armmagon over a waterfall. They recover Leo and escape through a time hole created by Future Don, but leave Armaggon stranded in Thantia.

:All eight Turtles, Past and Future, say their goodbyes. They send Shredder back to his own time with his memories of this erased but Verminator-X escapes their custody. Before the Turtles are sent home, Future Raph bid a tearful farewell to Ninjara and gives his younger self an ominous warning about the fragility of relationships. In the final panel, we see Armaggon next to a destroyed Turtleco building, revealing Thantia is an even farther future version of Earth.

'''Mutations: Issue #45'''
:Splinter reminisces back to when he was human, how Oroku Saki became the Shredder, and the events that lead him to New York and the origin of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. Splinter also reflects on their adventures with old enemies and meeting new friends (Mighty Mutanimals). Splinter catches the Turtles and Ninjara working on his surprise birthday party.

'''Issue #46'''
:Ninjara's brother Naga comes to the Turtles location to tell them that the elder (Ninjara's grandmother) of their clan was captured by a hunter for sport. Raph goes with Ninjara and Naga to their homeland to confront the hunter. The hunter captures the three of them, but the elder who was captured herself frees them all. The hunter follows them, so the elder uses a [[Torii]] to open a gateway as a means of escape, but the hunter goes into the Torii after them. The gateway leads them to the underworld and they are approached by a female demon. The only way back is to go through the Torii (portal) at the edge of a cliff, but only those who are "pure of heart" can walk through the Torii and return home. The hunter walks through, but falls to his death. Then the Elder goes through the portal back to Earth; Naga, Ninjara, and Raphael follow.

'''Issue #47'''
:The Turtles (minus Raphael) and Splinter race off to an emergency they saw on the news. A creature named Sarnath, who is a Triast created by the Mergia, and his pet Qark (a "dino-dog" creature with a spiked tail) were causing the disturbance. Qark was captured and the news reporter (McIntyre) who was covering the disturbance was about to reveal Qark live on TV. The Turtles and Splinter quickly help Qark escape, but for a moment Qark, the Turtles, and Splinter were caught on camera and then vanished within seconds to escape. From there the Turtles minus Splinter go with Sarnath in his spacecraft to pick up Raphael and Ninjara as they head on to Dimension X.

'''Black Hole Trilogy: Issues #48–50'''
:The Turtles with Ninjara, Sarnath, and Qark begin to travel in space when they are suddenly under attack near an unstable black hole. The ship gets partially destroyed and Sarnath gets sucked into the black hole, while the Turtles are saved by the Nova Posse, who are working with the Armada to stop a greater evil. Donatello is abducted by the Sons of Silence while all that remains is his suit, which Leonardo discovers.
::'''''MEGADEATH: Mini Series (Part I of VII)'''''
:::A picture of the Mighty Mutanimals is shown. A group of villains known as the Gang of Four: Waster, Fist, Dead-Eye, and Lynch, start shooting at the picture as they prepare to kill the Mutanimals. [To be Concluded]

The Sons of Silence abduct Donatello and communicate with him telepathically. Sarnath is found in the same limbo that they are in, technically located within the black hole. The Turnstone is present, which was thought to have been put out of existence (Reference back to Issue #13). Donatello begins to communicate with the Turnstone. The Armada, which includes the Nova Posse, Cudley, and some more old friends, prepare to battle against Emperor Mazool, who wants to rule the rest of Dimension X. The Armada moves in and attacks as the black hole begins to double in size with no sign of stopping. 
::'''''MEGADEATH: Mini Series (Part II of VII)'''''
:::Future Donatello and Raphael come through a time portal to warn the Mighty Mutanimals what is going to take place. Donatello brings his equipment to help build their headquarters and make preparations to defend them from the Gang of Four. Just then the Gang of Four arrive, fully loaded, ready to take everyone out. [To be Concluded]

'''Terracide: Issues #55–57'''
:The present-day Turtles are returning home in an airplane with the recently blinded Michaelangelo when they are attacked by Dead-Eye. Future Don and Raph come to the present to find the Mutanimals dead and Slash attacks them. Candy stops Slash and tells of how the Mutanimals really died. After burying the Mutanimals, Future Don, Raph, Candy, and Slash head out to find the present-day Turtles. They find out that the plane carrying the Turtles crashed and the Coast Guard picked up the pilot and Mike. They land on a nearby island to come up with a plan when they are attacked by Null and his minions. The Turtles take care of the minions, while Candy is kidnapped by Null. The Turtles go after Null while present-day Leo and Don goes after Mike. The group chase Null to Maligna's Hive World hidden on the dark side of the moon. Their ship was used as a distraction while they "time slipped" their way onto the hive world. Present-day Raph leads the way and Slash attacks the hive heart, alerting Maligna of their presence. The hive attacks and they save Candy as the hive slowly plunges into the sun. Slash tells them to leave while he prevents "the insects" from repairing the ship. Slash and the hive world burn up in the sun as the Turtles escape.

'''Early Years: Issue #58'''
:While in lock-up, Mike recounts how the Turtles got their colors: Three thugs stole a chip and used the sewers to escape, interrupting the Turtle's training. The thugs shot at the Turtles and the Turtles fought back. After dispatching the thugs, Master Splinter mistakenly scolded Don because they were all wearing red masks, so he couldn't tell them apart. After Mike accidentally broke a vase but wouldn't take the blame, they were all punished. They came up with a plan to take the tests that they each excelled at. Master Splinter realized their deception and came up with a plan to trick them. In the next test he only gave Mike the perfect score so that the brothers would fight amongst themselves. The thugs came back looking for the lost chip. The Turtles defeated them and turned them in to the cops. The Turtles came up with colored caps to identify themselves, but later changed to their colored masks and initialed belts.

The second book is ''Return of the Shredder'', and the final book, ''Intergalactic Wrestling and Other Adventures'', includes the stories ''Of Turtles and Stones and Mary Bones'', ''Intergalactic Wrestling'' and ''Wild Things''.

== Main characters ==
* '''[[Leonardo (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles)|Leonardo]]''': The leader of the group. He is the most talented fighter and is closest to Master Splinter.
* '''[[Donatello (TMNT)|Donatello]]''': The inventor of the group, Donatello builds most of the turtles gadgets and vehicles. In the future, he wears a purple jacket and is seen without his mask.
* '''[[Raphael (TMNT)|Raphael]]''': The wisecracking jokester of the group. However, as the series progressed, he became more angry and sullen like other incarnations. In the future, Raphael wears a hat and an eye patch. 
* '''[[Michelangelo (TMNT)|Michelangelo]]''': The most relaxed member of the group, he is mostly into pizza and goofing around with Donatello.
* '''[[Splinter (TMNT)|Splinter]]''': Sensei and surrogate father of the Turtles. Former leader of Foot Clan in Japan. Betrayed by Shredder and mutated into a rat-man.
* '''[[April O'Neil]]''': Initially reporter for Channel 6 as in TV show, but later becomes free-lance journalist.  Trained by Splinter in ninjitsu and katana.
* '''[[Shredder (TMNT)|Oroku Saki/the Shredder]]''': Current leader of the Foot Clan and arch-enemy of the Turtles.

==Supporting characters==
* '''Wrestler Turtles''', The wrestling costumes worn by the Turtles on Stump Asteroid were designed by Eastman and Laird in 1983 and were actually intended as real suits for the TMNT to wear in their self-published comic book series. The idea was quickly shelved, however, and the Turtles were outfitted in their familiar costumes: bandanna, elbow and knee pads, belt, etc. Creators Brown and Murphy incorporated the discarded costumes into the Adventures title feeling they were an important part of TMNT history, and that they shouldn't be hidden away and forgotten in some drawer. Most notably, Raphael wore his wrestling outfit, a full body black [[leotard]], for some time after returning from the asteroid.
* '''Cudley the Cowlick''', An alien in the shape of a cow's head who transported the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles to the [[Dimension X (TMNT)#Stump Asteroid|Stump Asteroid]] where they would fight against several aliens in their wildly popular "wrestling" outfits. Mirage Studio's staff artist [[Steve Lavigne]] created Cudley. As of Tales of the TMNT #52 (November 2008), Cudley was brought into Mirage continuity.
* '''[[Ray Fillet|Man-Ray]]''', An [[anthropomorphic]] [[manta ray]] the characters met in an adventure and was later spilled over into the "Mighty Mutanimals" comic-book series.
* '''Jagwar''', As his name implies, he is a jaguar-like mutant the Turtles met when in [[South America]]. Another spillover character to the "Mighty Mutanimals". Jagwar was created by Mirage Studio's writer [[Stephen Murphy (comics)|Stephen Murphy]] and artist [[Michael Dooney]].
* '''Dreadmon''', A hyena-like mutant with superhuman speed and stealth-like capabilities who guarded an [[Aztec]] Temple in South America. Once again, placed into the "Mighty Mutanimals" comic book series.
* '''Vid Vicious''', a man with a [[television]] grafted into his body which was used to hypnotize people.
* '''Wingnut &amp; Screwloose''', An alien bat (Wingnut) and an alien mosquito (Screwloose) from the planet Huanu, they first met the TMNT in issue 8, where they were seen vandalizing windows before the Turtles stopped them. They appeared again in issue 13, where they briefly assisted the Turtles in battle against Maligna's Malignoids. Later on in the series, they joined the "Mighty Mutanimals".
* '''[[List of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles supporting characters#Mondo Gecko|Mondo Gecko]]''': A teenage gecko who shares Michaelangelo's affinity for skateboarding, leading them to be close friends. He later joined the "Mighty Mutanimals".
* '''Scul''' and '''Bean''', Two aliens, one with a meteorite launcher in his skull, and both with tremendous mandibles. They were generals in the army of Maligna.
* '''Maligna''' and the '''Malignoids''', The matriarch of a vicious society of insect-like aliens who attempted to overtake the planet earth.
* '''Chien Khan''', A dog-like man who controlled a large empire of ninja, whose second-in-command was a young fox-like woman named Ninjara.
* '''Ninjara''', Chien Khan's second in command until after the TMNT defeated Chien Khan once and for all, and convinced Ninjara to join them in their battles against evil. She became one of the group for the greater part of the series afterwards and Raphael's girlfriend.
* '''Oyuki Mamisha''', A teenage girl from [[Japan]] who was up to no good until April O' Neil and the turtles showed her that life could be better. She became April's sidekick for the spin off-comic "April O' Neil" in which Chien Khan returns to his former glory in a battle with a demon who also took control of a large group of Ninja.
* '''Nova Posse''', A team of space adventurers that hail from [[Dimension X (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles)|Dimension X]]. Their commander is Luna Azul, and the other five members are Exeen, Grotto, Rave, Trip, and Zebulon.  They take care of Qark after Sarnath's fate is left unknown in issue #50.
* '''Tattoo''', A Japanese sumo-wrestler who obtained his name for having multitudes of tattoos. He asked [[Splinter (TMNT)|Splinter]] for a favour and requested that the TMNT rescue his chihuahua dog "Inky"  from a group of Yakuza who wanted him to throw his next fight for gambling purposes.
* '''Al Falqa''', A talking [[eagle]] co-created by Mirage Studio's artist [[Jim Lawson (comic book writer)|Jim Lawson]] that the Turtles encounter in [[Saudi Arabia]].
* '''Katmandu''', A four-armed tiger-like creature clad in Ancient East-Indian Armour. The Turtles encountered him in the [[People's Republic of China]]. Katmandu was created by [[Ryan Brown (comics)|Ryan Brown]] a Mirage artist.
* '''Null''', A businessman wearing a purple leisure suit who was ultimately responsible for the death of the Mighty Mutanimals, when he contracted a group of cyborgs to kill them. The death was highly controversial and somewhat gory as a spread of machine-gun bullets tore the group down. He was also responsible for a three-part story arc in the ''Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles'' storyline including the horsemen of the Apocalypse; Death, Famine, War, and Pestilence. Null himself seemed to be somehow the leader of the group, giving orders to Death who in turn controlled the other horsemen like puppets. Null seemed to be somehow linked to [[hell]]. Originally the character had two small horns projecting from his forehead, and with every new deed of evil he committed he grew more demonic. Eventually he grew larger horns, a demon-like tail, and wings like a [[bat]].
* '''Death''', '''Famine''', '''War''', '''Pestilence''', The four horsemen of the apocalypse.
* '''Armaggon''', An evil, time-traveling, talking [[shark]] who set the scale for the "Future Turtles" timeline in which the TMNT travel to the future and meet their future selves, wherein Splinter has died, and Ninjara has left Raphael, who is missing an eye.
* '''Verminator X''', Also known as "Manx", and is half-cat, half-machine, as well as being Donatello's Apprentice. He is only apparent in the future timelines, and eventually has a Catharsis in a controversial book (Part 5 of the second Future Turtles storyline, based on the Action Figure franchise in which the turtles have mechanized suits and rocket-launcher fists ) in which Raphael is willing to kill him for the greater good, resulting in destroying the machine that had taken over and poisoned Verminator's mind. At the end of this arc, Verminator survives and becomes good once again.
* '''[[Scumbug]]''', An exterminator called to spray the Shredder's lair is turned into a giant cockroach.
* '''Wyrm''', A mutated monster planarian worm that fought [[Scumbug]].
* '''May East''', created by Stanley Wiater and Ryan Brown, is an ancient evil sorceress from whom April O'Neil is descended.
*'''Chameleon''' is a mercenary spy working for the highest bidder. He first appears in Issue 9 as a well-dressed agent with a characteristic lazy eye, having stolen top secret weapons plans from the United Nations. Shredder covets these plans for himself, and sends Bebop and Rocksteady to capture Chameleon and retrieve the plans. Hiding from the authorities in the sewers, Chameleon finds himself in the middle of a battle between the two and the Turtles, and is captured after hiding the weapons plans in the sewer wall. He is then mutated into a human-sized chameleon by Shredder after divulging the whereabouts of the plans (after unsuccessfully trying to make a deal with Shredder). Using his newfound powers of camouflage and light radiance, Chameleon outsmarts Shredder, Bebop, and Rocksteady, and retrieves the plans. He then covertly returns them to the U.N. deciding that some things are just not worth profiting over. Chameleon encounters the Turtles later on in issue #51, hoping in vain to reverse his mutation.

'''''The Power of Children: Making a Difference''''' is a permanent [[exhibition]] at [[The Children's Museum of Indianapolis]] that focuses on the life story of three children who had suffered hardship borne of prejudice — [[Anne Frank]], [[Ruby Bridges]], and [[Ryan White]]. The exhibit is accompanied by the annual '''Power of Children Awards''' recognizing local children in [[sixth grade#United States|grades 6]]–[[eleventh grade#United States|11]] who have made a significant contribution to the local community. The exhibit has received critical acclaim among [[Museology]] professionals&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Simon |first=Nina |title=Review of an exhibition: The Power of Children |url=http://www.exhibitfiles.org/the_power_of_children |work=Exhibit Files |publisher=Association of Science - Technology Centers |accessdate=3 October 2012 |date=12 May 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Wood&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Wood |first1=Elizabeth |last2=Cole |first2=Sarah |title=Can you do that in a Children's Museum? |journal=Museums &amp; Social Issues |year=2007 |volume=2 |issue=2 |pages=193–200 |publisher=Left Coast Press }}&lt;/ref&gt; and received a 2009 [[American Association for State and Local History]] "award of merit".&lt;ref name="AASLH"&gt;{{cite web |title=2009 Leadership in History Awards |url=http://www.aaslh.org/documents/2009awardsbanquetprogram.pdf |publisher=[[American Association for State and Local History]] |accessdate=3 October 2012 |page=15 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Exhibit==
Established in 2007, and targeting children aged 10–14, it "provides a safe place for families and students to explore issues of intolerance, fear, and prejudice and related historical artifacts as experienced in the lives of three children Anne Frank, Ruby Bridges, and Ryan White."&lt;ref name="AASLH" /&gt; Respectively, these case studies allow children to learn about [[the holocaust]], [[AIDS]], and [[racial segregation]] illustrated by the experiences of the three children. The use of artifacts and immersive exhibit design (including, among other things a complete recreation of Ryan's bedroom), allow children to imagine themselves in the situation that each of the famous children faced. "[t]he stories of ordinary children in history can inspire young people today to fight prejudice and discrimination and make a positive difference in the world".&lt;ref name=Teacher&gt;{{cite web|title=Teacher Resources|url=http://www.childrensmuseum.org/themuseum/powerofchildren/html/teachers.html|publisher=Children's Museum of Indianapolis|accessdate=3 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The exhibit uses the museum theater technique of [[first-person interpretation]] to make an interactive experience. Closing off a section of the exhibition space and inviting the audience to immerse themselves in the setting (in the case of the Ruby Bridges portion - by sitting in a replica classroom), an adult actor makes a 10–15 minute performance using props and some interaction. The quality of execution and educational effectiveness of this part of the exhibition has drawn particular praise from museum theorists as it "...integrate[s] live theater experiences into exhibition spaces, more naturally connecting visitors to important objects and stories".&lt;ref name=Simon&gt;{{cite book|last=Simon|first=Nina|title=The Participatory Museum|chapter=Chapter 4: Social Objects|year=2010|isbn=0615346502|url=http://www.participatorymuseum.org/chapter4/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010 [[Elton John]] performed a benefit concert in Indianapolis to support the exhibit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A special benefit concert with Elton John: Celebrating the life and legacy of RYAN WHITE|url=http://www.childrensmuseum.org/ryanwhite/|publisher=Children's Museum of Indianapolis|accessdate=3 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Elton John AIDS Foundation]] was founded in honor of Ryan White.

==Awards==
Predating the development of the permanent exhibition, the ''Power of Children Awards'' are given annually to between four and six recipients, presented at a gala dinner attended by local dignitaries, the runners-up and winners' families and the museum's executive. The awards aims to "recognize Indiana youths who have made a significant impact on the lives of others, demonstrated selflessness, and exhibited a commitment to service and the betterment of society".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Mark|first=Mark|title=Award-winning effort: local teen demonstrates 'Power of Children'|url=http://www.nwitimes.com/niche/yourfamily/education/award-winning-effort-local-teen-demonstrates-power-of-children/article_cb130c90-c9c4-597c-879b-9d054a9bca30.html|work=Northwest Indiana, nwi.com|publisher=The Times Media Company|accessdate=3 October 2012|date=30 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Each award includes: a $2000 grant to continue the project; a four-year scholarship to either the [[University of Indianapolis]] or [[IUPUI]]; a short showcase video on local television station [[WISH-TV]]; and a display panel within the ''Power of Children'' exhibition.&lt;ref name=POCA&gt;{{cite web|title=Power of Children Awards|url=http://www.childrensmuseum.org/poca|publisher=Children's Museum of  Indianapolis|accessdate=3 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Seven Deadly Sins and the Four Last Things''''' is a painting attributed to [[Hieronymus Bosch]]&lt;ref&gt;Silva Maroto, Pilar (ed.) (2016). El Bosco. La exposición del V centenario. Madrid: Museo Nacional del Prado. {{ISBN|978-84-848-0316-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;C. Garrido and R. Van Schoote (2001). Bosch At The Museo Del Prado: a technical Study. Aldeasa, Madrid. {{ISBN|978-8480032650}}&lt;/ref&gt; or to a follower of his,&lt;ref&gt;Ilsink, Matthijs; Koldeweij, Jos (2016). Hieronymus Bosch: Painter and Draughtsman – Catalogue raisonné. Yale University Press. p. 504. {{ISBN|978-0-300-22014-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; completed around 1500 or later. Since 1898 its authenticity has been questioned several times. In 2015 the Bosch Research Conservation Project claimed it to be by a follower, but scholars at the [[Museo del Prado|Prado]], where the painting hangs, dismissed this argument. The painting is oil on wooden panels and is presented in a series of circular images.

Four small circles, detailing the [[four last things]] — [[Death]], [[Divine judgment|Judgment]], [[Heaven (Christianity)|Heaven]], and [[Christian views on hell|Hell]] — surround a larger circle in which the [[seven deadly sins]] are depicted: [[anger|wrath]] at the bottom, then (proceeding clockwise) [[envy]], [[Seven deadly sins#Greed|greed]], [[gluttony]], [[sloth (deadly sin)|sloth]], extravagance (later replaced with [[lust]]), and [[pride]], using scenes from life rather than [[allegorical]] representations of the sins.&lt;ref name=BoschBruegel&gt;{{cite book|year=1980|author=Claudia Lyn Cahan and Catherine Riley|isbn=0-517-30373-6|title=Bosch~Bruegel and the Northern Renaissance|publisher=Avenal Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the centre of the large circle, which is said to represent the [[Eye of Providence|eye of God]], is a "pupil" in which [[Jesus|Christ]] can be seen [[Resurrection of Jesus|emerging from his tomb]]. Below this image is the [[Latin]] inscription ''Cave cave d[omi]n[u]s videt'' ("Beware, Beware, The Lord Sees").

Above and below the central image are inscription in Latin of [[Book of Deuteronomy|Deuteronomy]] [[Song of Moses|32:28–29]], containing the lines "For they are a nation void of counsel, neither is there any understanding in them", above, and "O that they were wise, that they understood this, that they would consider their latter end!" below.

==Disputed authorship and dating==
In 1560, [[Felipe de Guevara]] wrote about a pupil of Bosch, an unnamed ''discipulo'' (pupil), who was as good as his master and even signed his works with his master's name.&lt;ref&gt;Felipe de Guevara (1560), ''Commentarios de la Pintura''.  English summary and commentary in: Stechow, Wolfgang, (1966), ''Northern Renaissance Art 1400-1600: Sources and Documents'' (paperback 1989, pp. 19-20).&lt;/ref&gt; Immediately after this, and without starting a new paragraph, Guevara refers to the painting of the ''Seven Deadly Sins'' as characteristic of his style. This led some scholars, as early as Dollmayr (1898) and most vocally Stechow (1966), to ascribe the work to this pupil. 

Most experts have argued since, however, that given the highly ambiguous nature of the passage, Guevara had probably returned to a description of the works of Bosch himself. Furthermore, the accuracy and authority of Guevara is suspect: when in 1570 Guevara's heirs sold a copy of ''[[The Haywain Triptych]]'' to [[Phillip II of Spain]], it was made clear that Guevara had regarded that work as the original painted by Bosch himself, whilst nowadays it is known that his was a copy (displayed in [[El Escorial]]), of the original hanging in [[Prado]]. [[Phillip II of Spain]] himself purchased the work (prior to 1560, probably from a monastery art sale) in the belief that ''The Seven Deadly Sins'' was a Bosch original, and he always regarded it as such. It was his favourite Bosch painting and it hung in his own bedroom in [[El Escorial]]. When he donated the painting to [[El Escorial]] in 1574, it was cataloged as being a Bosch original; Silva Maroto argued that it is hard to believe that Guevara would question the authorship of Phillip's favourite Bosch {{clarify |text=in an ambiguous manuscript that remained unpublished until 1788.|reason=Antecedent unclear. Was the unpublished letter written by Silva Maroto or Guevara? Please give evidence within the reference tags, including page numbers.|date=September 2017}}&lt;ref&gt;Silva Maroto, Pilar (ed.) (2016). ''El Bosco. La exposición del V centenario''. Madrid: [[Museo Nacional del Prado]]. {{ISBN|978-84-848-0316-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The alleged poor quality of the drawing had led to the incorrect belief it dates from Bosch's early period. The attribution to the ''discipulo'' was revived in the catalogue of the 2001 Bosch exhibition in [[Rotterdam]], by Vermet and Vandenbroeck, who also suggested that several of the costumes suggest a much later date, around 1500, so that the awkward drawing and execution cannot be attributed to youthful imperfection. They also noted that the painting is not on oak, adding to their doubts about the attribution to Bosch.&lt;ref&gt;Koldeweij, J., P. Vandenbroeck, J. and Vermet, B. (2001), ''Jheronimus Bosch: The complete paintings and drawings'', [[Harry N. Abrams]], {{ISBN|978-0810967359}}, pp. 93 and 178.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Nowadays, most art historians agree that the costumes point at a date in between 1505 and 1510; it is argued that the key characteristics of the underlying drawing, the way the pictorial surface was developed, and the variety of strokes are entirely consistent with Bosch's later paintings. Furthermore, the theme, symbolism and the composition itself is profoundly original, which would make it extremely unlikely that an unknown pupil could have painted it.&lt;ref&gt;C. Garrido and R. Van Schoote (2001). ''Bosch At The Museo Del Prado: A Technical Study''. Aldeasa, Madrid. {{ISBN|978-8480032650}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, Ed Hoffman argued for the work being a copy, perhaps ordered by [[Philip II of Spain]] after the original had been damaged. In his view, the amateurish style, the plump figures, the lack of white highlights and the fact that the wooden panel is not oak but poplar (which can't be dated with [[dendrochronology]]). An argument for the authenticity, or at least originality, of the work could be found in the [[pentimenti]] of the underpainting, which indicate it could not have been a simple faithful reproduction. In addition, there is no question signature in the painting is that of Bosch himself, and not a [[forgery]].&lt;ref name="Hoffman2005"&gt;Ed Hoffman, 2005, "Een echte 'Jheronimus Bosch'? : Tien aandachtspunten", ''Bossche Bladen'' '''3''': 90-96&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2015, the Bosch Research and Conservation Project,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://boschproject.org/|title=Bosch Research and Conservation Project |website=boschproject.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; which had been responsible, since 2007, for technical research on most of Bosch's paintings, rejected the attribution to Bosch and deemed it to be made by a follower, most likely the ''discipulo''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nos.nl/nieuwsuur/artikel/2066164-twee-beroemde-werken-toch-niet-van-jeroen-bosch.html Twee beroemde werken toch niet van Jeroen Bosch], NOS, 31 October 2015&lt;/ref&gt; In response, the Prado Museum stated that they still consider the piece to be authentic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Ferrer|first1=Isabel|title=¿Pintó El Bosco los ‘pecados’ de El Prado?|url=http://cultura.elpais.com/cultura/2015/10/31/actualidad/1446299443_830382.html|work=[[El País]]|date=1 November 2015|quote=El Museo del Prado, de Madrid, por el contrario, cree que la tabla sí es del artista, y sus propias conclusiones aparecerán en mayo, cuando la exposición viaje a Madrid. [The Museo del Prado, Madrid, by contrast, believes that the table itself is by the artist, and their own conclusions appear in May when the exhibition travels to Madrid.]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Content==
Each panel in the outer circle depicts a different sin. Clockwise from top (Latin names in brackets):

# [[Gluttony]] (''gula''): A drunkard swigs from a bottle while a fat man eats greedily, not heeding the plea of his equally obese young son.
# [[Sloth (deadly sin)|Sloth]] (''acedia''): A lazy man dozes in front of the fireplace while Faith appears to him in a dream, in the guise of a nun, to remind him to say his prayers.
# [[Lust]] (''luxuria''): Two couples enjoy a picnic in a pink tent, with two clowns (right) to entertain them.
# [[Pride]] (''superbia''): With her back to the viewer, a woman looks at her reflection in a mirror held up by a demon.
# [[Wrath]] (''ira''): A woman attempts to break up a fight between two drunken peasants.
# [[Envy]] (''invidia''): A couple standing in their doorway cast envious looks at a rich man with a hawk on his wrist and a servant to carry his heavy load for him, while their daughter flirts with a man standing outside her window, with her eye on the well-filled purse at his waist. The dogs illustrate the Flemish saying, “Two dogs and only one bone, no agreement”.
# [[Greed]] (''avaricia''): A crooked judge pretends to listen sympathetically to the case presented by one party to a lawsuit, while slyly accepting a bribe from the other party.

The four small circles also have details. In Death of the Sinner, death is shown at the doorstep along with an angel and a demon while the priest says the sinner's last rites, In Glory, the saved are entering Heaven, with Jesus and the saints, at the gate of Heaven an Angel prevents a demon from ensnaring a woman. Saint Peter is shown as the gatekeeper. In Judgment, Christ is shown in glory while angels awake the dead, while in the Hell demons torment sinners according to their sins.
