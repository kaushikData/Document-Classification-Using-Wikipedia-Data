      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3461">'''Alexander Nahum Sack''' or Aleksandr Naumovich Zak, (5 October 1890 in [[Moscow]], [[Russia]] – 1955 in [[New York City]], United States), was a [[jurisprudence]] expert and professor of Russian law, specialized in international financial legislation. After teaching in [[Saint Petersburg]] university, he left the [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic|Soviet Russia]] in 1921 to settle in [[Estonia]], where he advised the government in monetary issues. He also gained the Estonian citizenship, but moved to Paris in 1925. He taught at the Institute of Political Studies in Paris and in the International Law Academy in The Hague before moving to London in 1929 to work as an expert for Equitable Life Insurance. Work for this company led him to New York, where he definitely established in 1930. After obtaining the USA nationality, he was invited to teach at Northwestern University and New York University until 1943, working as a free-lance law expert for the Justice Department until 1947.

Sack is best known for his formalization of the [[odious debt]] doctrine in his work ''Les effets des transformations des Etats sur leurs dettes publiques et autres obligations financières'' (''Effects of the transformations of the states in their public debts and other financial obligations''), published in Paris in 1927, when he taught law at the Institute of Political Studies. Alexander Sack synthetised the concept of odious debt based on precedents from the 19th century, such as the Mexican government rejection to pay debts acquired by the emperor [[Maximilian I of Mexico|Maximilian I]], and the rejection by the USA, once annexed Cuba, to pay the debts acquired when it was a Spanish colony.

}}'''Bokusan Nishiari''' ({{CJKV|j=西有穆山|r=Nishiari Bokusan}}), was a prominent Japanese [[Sōtō]] [[Zen]] [[Buddhist]] monk during the [[Meiji Era]]. He is considered one of the most influential Sōtō priests of the modern era due to his elevation of the status of the school's founder [[Eihei Dōgen]], the many prominent positions he held during his lifetime, and his almost equally prolific disciples [[Sōtan Oka]] and [[Ian Kishizawa]]. Nishiari's positions included abbot of Sōtō's head temple [[Sōji-ji]], professor at what would become [[Komazawa University]], and chief priest, or ''kanchō'', of the entire Sōtō school. His student Sōtan Oka was the first abbot of [[Antai-ji]] and a teacher to both [[Kōdō Sawaki]] and [[Hashimoto Ekō]], each of whom are the source of Zen lineages in the United States. His student Ian Kishizawa taught [[Shunryū Suzuki]], the founder of the [[San Francisco Zen Center]]. Though critical of Nishiari later in his life, the founder of the [[Sanbō Kyōdan]] sect [[Hakuun Yasutani]] also studied extensively with him and Kishizawa.&lt;ref name=thesis&gt;{{citation|last=Rutschman-Byler|first=Jiryu Mark|year=2014|title=Sōtō Zen in Meiji Japan: The Life and Times of Nishiari Bokusan|isbn= 9781312770911|publisher=University of California, Berkeley}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Buddhist studies scholar William Bodiford writes of Nishiari: {{quote|Today, when someone remembers [[Dōgen]] or thinks of [[Sōtō Zen]], most often that person automatically thinks of Dōgen's [[Shōbōgenzō]]. This kind of automatic association of Dōgen with this work is very much a modern development. By the end of the fifteenth century most of Dōgen's writings had been hidden from view in temple vaults where they became secret treasures&amp;nbsp;... In earlier generations only one Zen teacher, Nishiari Bokusan (1821–1910), is known to have ever lectured on how the Shōbōgenzō should be read and understood.&lt;ref name=Bod&gt;{{citation|last = Bodiford| first = William M. | year =2006 | title = Remembering Dōgen: Eiheiji and Dōgen Hagiography| journal = Society for Japanese Studies| volume = 32| issue = 1| pages = 1–21| issn = 1549-4721| | doi = 10.1353/jjs.2006.0003| url = http://www.thezensite.com/ZenEssays/DogenStudies/Remembering_Dogen.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

'''Confucian ritual religion''' ([[Simplified Chinese|s]] 礼教, [[Traditional Chinese|t]] 禮教 ''Lǐjiào'', "rites' transmission", also called 名教 ''Míngjiào'', the "names' transmission"), or the '''Confucian civil religion''',{{sfnb|Dessein|2014}} defines the [[civil religion]] of [[China]]. It consists in the state-endorsed ceremonies and sacrifices ([[cult (religious practice)|cults]]), held according to [[Confucianism|Confucian]] modalities, dedicated to those gods which represent the [[Chinese theology|theologico]]-political origin of the state itself and the Chinese civilisation.{{sfnb|Billioud|Thoraval|2015|pp=173-174}} These rituals have undergone a great revitalisation in post-Maoist China creating a public space in which the Chinese state and popular Confucian movements jostle and negotiate with each other.{{sfnb|Billioud|Thoraval|2015|pp=173-174}}

Worship of cosmological gods and of [[Confucius]],{{sfnb|Billioud|Thoraval|2009}}{{sfnb|Billioud|Thoraval|2015|pp=173-174}} is carried out regularly at [[Chinese temple|consecrated public spaces]]

'''''Contradictio in adiecto''''' is [[Latin]] [[Etymology|for]] "a contradiction between parts of an argument" (''adiectum'' "brought about, brought forward"). It differs from a "contradiction in terms", which refers to two contradictory words normally appearing together, e.g.,  "cold heat".  It is "the characteristic denoted by the adjective stands in contrast to the noun." &lt;ref name="Basic Rhetorics Tropes web site"&gt;[http://www.as.uni-heidelberg.de/projekte/rhetorics/tropes.html Basic Rhetorics Tropes web site] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070830094804/http://www.as.uni-heidelberg.de/projekte/rhetorics/tropes.html |date=2007-08-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Tort law}}
'''Contributory negligence''' in [[common law]] jurisdictions is generally a [[defense (legal)|defense]] to a claim based on negligence, an action in [[tort]]. This principle is relevant to the determination of liability and is applicable when  [[plaintiffs]]/[[claimants]] have, through their own negligence, contributed to the harm they suffered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Contributory Negligence|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/contributory_negligence|website=Wex|publisher=Cornell Law School|accessdate=28 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some jurisdictions it may be applied by the court in a tort matter irrespective of whether it was pleaded as a defense.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Douglas v. Harris, 35 N.J. 270, 281, 173 A.2d 1 (1961)|url=https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=16113360978766983305|website=Google Scholar|publisher=Google|accessdate=28 June 2017}} "[T]he rule requiring a defendant to so affirmatively plead [contributory negligence] is mandatory. However, the court may relax that rule when its enforcement would be inconsistent with substantial justice."&lt;/ref&gt;

The contributory negligence defense can potentially eliminate the defendant's responsibility to pay damages to an injured plaintiff. For example, a [[pedestrian]] crosses a road negligently and is hit by a driver who was driving negligently. Since the pedestrian has also contributed to the accident, they may be barred from complete and full recovery of damages from the driver (or their insurer) because the accident was less likely to occur if it hadn't been for their failure to keep a proper lookout.  Another example of contributory negligence is where a plaintiff actively  disregards warnings or fails to take reasonable steps for his or her safety, then [[Assumption of risk|assumes a certain level of risk]] in a given activity; such as diving in shallow water without checking the depth first.

== History ==
The doctrine of contributory negligence was dominant in U.S. [[jurisprudence]] in the 19th and 20th century.&lt;ref name=Little2007/&gt; The English case [[Butterfield v. Forrester]] is generally recognized as the first appearance, although in this case the judge found the victim to be the sole [[proximate cause]] of the injury.&lt;ref name=Little2007/&gt;

==Burden of proof==
In some jurisdictions, in order to successfully raise an contributory negligence defense, the defendant must prove the [[negligence]] of a plaintiff or claimant. In others, the burden of proof is on a plaintiff to disprove his or her own negligence.

Even if the plaintiff was negligent, the [[tortfeasor]] may still be held liable if he or she had the [[last clear chance]] to prevent the injury, meaning that even though the plaintiff was negligent the defendant was the last person with a clear opportunity to take action that would have prevented the plaintiff's injury from occurring.

==Availability==
Contributory negligence is generally a defense to a tort of negligence. The defense is not available if the [[tortfeasor]]'s conduct amounts to malicious or intentional wrongdoing, rather than to ordinary negligence.

In some jurisdictions, the doctrine states that a victim who is at fault to any degree, including only 1% at fault, may be denied compensation entirely. This is known as pure contributory negligence.&lt;ref name=Little2007&gt;Little WBL. (2007). [http://law.campbell.edu/lawreview/articles/30-1-81.pdf "It is Much Easier to Find Fault With Others, Than to be Faultless Ourselves": Contributory Negligence as a Bar to a Claim for Breach of the Implied Warranty of Merchantability]. ''Campbell Law Review''.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Australia===
In Australia, particularly New South Wales, the award of damages is reduced by the same percentage as the plaintiff's own negligence.&lt;ref&gt;''Civil Liability Act 2002 (NSW), Part 1A, Division 8,'' see also {{cite Legislation AU|NSW|act|lrpa1965404|Law Reform Miscellaneous Act 1965|9}}(1)(b).&lt;/ref&gt; For example, if the plaintiff was 50% negligent in causing his or her own accident, but would otherwise be entitled to $100,000 in damages, a court will award only $50,000. A court may also find that 100% contributory negligence is applicable in which case the plaintiff is not entitled to any damages.&lt;ref&gt;Civil Liability Act 2002 (NSW), section 5S&lt;/ref&gt; Determining the extent of the contributory negligence is subjective and heavily dependent on the evidence available. Parties will often work to negotiate a mutually satisfactory percentage figure when engaging in [[alternative dispute resolution]] (such as mediation). If the matter does not settle, a percentage figure is ultimately assigned by the court at the hearing.

In Australia, contributory negligence is available when the plaintiff's own negligence contributed to its own injuries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lexisnexis.com/au/legal/results/enhdocview.do?docLinkInd=true&amp;ersKey=23_T18782872968&amp;format=GNBFULL&amp;startDocNo=0&amp;resultsUrlKey=0_T18782872970&amp;backKey=20_T18782872971&amp;csi=267716&amp;docNo=1&amp;scrollToPosition=0 Froom v Butcher [1976&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt; 1 QB 286]&lt;/ref&gt; Also refer to ''Pennington v Norris'' for second test.&lt;ref name="Pennington v Norris"&gt;{{cite AustLII|HCA|26|1956|litigants=Pennington v Norris |parallelcite=(1956) 96 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 10 |courtname=[[High Court of Australia|High Court]] |date=6 June 1956}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
In the United States, the pure contributory negligence only applies in Alabama, Maryland, North Carolina, and Virginia. Indiana applies pure contributory negligence to medical malpractice cases and tort claims against governmental entities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Swisher|first1=Peter N.|title=Virginia Should Abolish the Archaic Tort Defense of Contributory Negligence and Adopt a Comparative Negligence Defense in Its Place|journal=University of Richmond Law Review|date=2011|volume=46|page=359|url=http://heinonline.org/HOL/LandingPage?handle=hein.journals/urich46&amp;div=16&amp;id=&amp;page=|accessdate=6 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the other 45 states in the U.S., plaintiff's recovery is simply diminished by the extent to which he or she contributed to the harm under principles of [[comparative negligence]], with some states using a mixed model of comparative and contributory negligence.

===United Kingdom===
In England and Wales, it is not possible to defeat a claim under contributory negligence and therefore completely deny the victim compensation. It does however allow for a reduction in damages recoverable to the extent that the court sees fit.&lt;ref name=Act_1945&gt;.

In [[England and Wales]], it is not a defense to the tort of [[Conversion (law)|conversion]] or [[trespass to chattels]]. In the United States, it is not a defense to any intentional tort.  

===India===
In [[India]] compensation in favour of victim gets reduced in proportion with his negligence.

The '''''Discourse on Metaphysics''''' ({{lang-fr|Discours de métaphysique}}, 1686) is a short treatise by [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz]] in which he develops a philosophy concerning physical substance, motion and resistance of bodies, and God's role within the universe. It is one of the few texts presenting in a consistent form the earlier philosophy of Leibniz.

The ''Discourse'' is closely connected to the epistolary discussion which he carried with [[Antoine Arnauld]].&lt;ref&gt;Sleigh R., ''Leibniz and Arnauld'', New haven: Yale, 1990.&lt;/ref&gt; However Leibniz refrained from sending the full text and it remained unpublished until the mid 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;The first edition (in 1846 by Pertz) was from a copy but later the original manuscript was found and  Henri Lestrienne published it in 1907; now it is printed in the ''Akademie Ausgabe'', Reihe VI, Vierter Band, S.1529&lt;/ref&gt; Arnauld received only an abridged version in 37 points which resumed whole paragraphs and steered their discussion.

The metaphysical considerations proceed from God to the substantial world and back to the spiritual realm. The starting point for the work is the conception of God as ''an absolutely perfect being'' (I), that God is good but goodness exists independently of God (a rejection of [[divine command theory]]) (II), and that God has created the world in an ordered and perfect fashion (III–VII).

At the time of its writing ''Discourse'' made the controversial claim ''That the opinions of... [[scholasticism|scholastic]] philosophers are not to be wholly despised'' (XI). Early work in [[modern philosophy]] during [[17th-century philosophy|the 17th century]] were based on a rejection of many of the precepts of medieval philosophy. Leibniz saw the failures of scholasticism merely as one of rigor. ''[If] some careful and meditative mind were to take the trouble to clarify and direct their thoughts in the manner of analytic geometers, he would find a great treasure of important truths, wholly demonstrable.''

Leibniz claimed that God's omnipotence was in no way impugned by the thought of evil, but was rather solidified. He endorsed the view that God chose the best of all possible worlds.  In other words, Leibniz believed this world (or reality) to be the best there possibly could be&amp;nbsp;— taking all facts into account, no better world could be imagined, even if we believed that we could think of something more perfect.

Leibniz's conception of physical substance is expanded upon in ''[[The Monadology]]''.

The '''doctrine of indivisibility''' (or '''indivisibility doctrine''') was a [[legal doctrine]] in [[United States copyright law]], which held that a [[copyright]] was a single, indivisible right that its owner could only [[Assignment (law)|assign]] as a whole.  The doctrine was founded upon the policy concern that a [[defendant]] alleged to have infringed a single work might find himself facing claims from multiple [[plaintiff]]s, all claiming copyright in that same work.  Despite the indivisibility doctrine, a copyright holder could still effectively assign certain rights.  The assignees of those rights were held to be "mere licensees."

This doctrine could yield a harsh result for an exclusive licensee in a work.  If a third party [[Copyright infringement|infringed]] the work, the copyright holder had no motivation to file suit---the work was no longer marketable.  So courts allowed exclusive licensees to compulsively join the copyright holder as a plaintiff in such suits.  Non-exclusive licensees could not forcefully join copyright holders, on the theory that in those cases, the work was still marketable and the copyright holder therefore had an interest in protecting his rights.

In the case ''[[Dark Passage|Goodis v. United Artists Television, Inc.]]'', 425 [[Federal Reporter|F.2d]] 397, the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit]] held that the doctrine of indivisibility could not operate to wholly deprive an author of his copyright when a "mere licensee" secured a copyright in a [[Collective work (US)|collective work]] but the author never secured a separate copyright on his own.

The doctrine of indivisibility was expressly eliminated in the [[Copyright Act of 1976]]. Assignees of rights in a copyrighted work now have standing to directly file suit against infringers.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7321">'''Forest genetic resources''' or '''tree genetic resources''' are genetic material of shrub and tree species of actual or future value. Forest genetic resources are essential for forest-depending communities who rely for a substantial part of their livelihoods on [[timber]] and [[non-timber forest product]]s (for example fruits, gums and resins) for food security, domestic use and income generation. These resources are also the basis for large-scale wood production in planted forests to satisfy the worldwide need for timber and paper. Genetic resources of several important timber, fruit and other non-timber tree species are conserved [[ex situ]] in genebanks or maintained in field collections. Nevertheless, [[in situ conservation]] in forests and on farms is in the case of most tree species the most important measure to protect their genetic resources.

==Understanding diversity==

A better understanding of the diversity of these species is crucial for their sustainable use and conservation.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite journal |author1=Dawson, I.K. |author2=Lengkeek, A. |author3=Weber, J.C. |author4=Jamnadass, R. |year= 2009 |title= Managing genetic variation in tropical trees: linking knowledge with action in agroforestry ecosystems for improved conservation and enhanced livelihoods |journal=Biodiversity and Conservation |volume=18 |doi= 10.1007/s10531-008-9516-z}}&lt;/ref&gt; Monitoring  ol patterns of distribution and genetic diversity of these species allows the  prioritization of populations for [[in situ conservation]], identification of populations and species  most at risk and existing gaps in genebank collections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Scheldeman, X.  |author2=van Zonneveld, M.|year=2010|title=Training Manual on Spatial Analysis of Plant Diversity and Distribution|publisher=Bioversity International

==The State of the World's Forest Genetic Resources==
In 2014, the [[Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations]] published the first [http://www.fao.org/forestry/fgr/64582/en/ State of the World's Forest Genetic Resources].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=UN urges action to protect forests' genetic diversity|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-27715552|accessdate=23 July 2014|agency=BBC|publisher=BBC News Science and Environment|date=5 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The State of the World's Forest Genetic Resources|date=2014|publisher=FAO|location=Rome|url=http://www.fao.org/3/a-i3825e.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Action needed to safeguard genetic diversity of the world's forests|url=http://www.fao.org/news/story/en/item/233303/icode/|publisher=FAO|date=3 June 2014|accessdate=23 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The publication addressed the conservation, management and sustainable use of forest tree and other woody [[plant genetic resources]] of actual and potential value for human well-being in the broad range of management systems.  It was prepared based on information provided by 86 countries, outcomes from regional and subregional consultations, and commissioned [http://www.fao.org/forestry/fgr/71306/en/ thematic studies]. Amongst the [http://www.fao.org/3/a-i3827e.pdf ten key findings], half of the forest species reported as regularly utilized by countries are threatened by the conversion of forests to pastures and farmland, [[overexploitation]], and the impacts of climate change.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.redassranch.com/ |title=Redassranch Agriculture, gardening and forestry resources |accessdate=March 17, 2016 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6g4lsW85R?url=http://www.redassranch.com/ |archivedate=March 17, 2016 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the basis of the information and knowledge compiled by [[FAO]] for The State of World’s Forest Genetic Resources, the [[Commission on Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture]] developed the Global Plan of Action for the Conservation, Sustainable Use and Development of Forest Genetic Resources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Global Plan of Action for the conservation, sustainable use and development of forest genetic resources|date=2014|publisher=FAO|location=Rome|url=http://www.fao.org/3/a-i3849e.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; This Global Plan of Action identifies 27 strategic priorities grouped into 4 areas: 1) improving the availability of, and access to, information on forest genetic resources; 2) conservation of forest genetic resources (in situ and ex situ); 3) sustainable use, development and management of forest genetic resources; 4) policies, institutions and capacity-building.

==Forest genetic resources and climate change==
Even though this is a field with many uncertainties, it is evident that during the next 50–100 years climate changes will have an effect on the distribution of forest tree species and the composition of forests. Diversity of forest genetic resources enables the potential for a [[species]] (or a [[population]]) to adapt to climatic changes and related future challenges such as temperature changes, [[drought]], [[Pest (organism)|pests]], [[disease]]s and [[forest fire]]s.&lt;ref name=Kelleher15&gt;{{citation |last1=Kelleher et al. |title=Approaches to the conservation of forest genetic resources in Europe in the context of climate change |publisher=[[European Forest Genetic Resources Programme]] |date=2015 |url=http://www.euforgen.org/publications/publication/approaches-to-the-conservation-of-forest-genetic-resources-in-europe-in-the-context-of-climate-chang/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though forest trees are known for showing great plasticity in their response to climate changes,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Savolainen et al.|title=Adaptive Potential of Northernmost Tree Populations to Climate Change, with Emphasis on Scots Pine (Pinus sylvestris L.)|journal=Journal of Heredity|date=2011|volume=102 |issue=5|pages=526–36}}&lt;/ref&gt; not all species are naturally capable to adapt at the pace necessary. For that reason human interventions, such as transfer of [[forest reproductive material]], may be needed. This is particular important for rare and scattered distributed species and species found on the edge of its [[distribution range]].&lt;ref name=Kelleher15/&gt;

[[File:François Jean de Chastellux.jpg|thumb|300px|François Jean de Chastellux, portrait by [[Charles Willson Peale]]]]
'''François Jean de Beauvoir, Marquis de Chastellux''' ({{IPA-fr|fʁɑ̃swa ʒɑ̃ də bovwaʁ maʁki də ʃatly|lang}}; 5 May 1734, in [[Paris]] – 24 October 1788, in Paris), was a military officer who served during the War of American Independence as a major general in the French expeditionary forces led by general Comte de [[Jean-Baptiste Donatien de Vimeur, comte de Rochambeau|Rochambeau]]. Being on general Rochambeau's staff for the duration of the war, Chastellux acted as the principal liaison officer between the French commander in chief and [[George Washington]]. However the Chevalier de Chastellux was also widely recognized, at the time of his campaigns in America, as a highly talented man of letters and a member of the [[Académie française]]

==Early literary career==
He first became known as a writer, historian and [[philosopher]]. He was the third member elected to occupy [[List of members of the Académie française#Seat 2|Seat 2]] of the Académie française in 1775.

==Military career in America==
After arriving in America in July 1780, Chastellux participated to the [[American Revolutionary War]] as Major General in the French expeditionary force led by general [[Jean-Baptiste Donatien de Vimeur, comte de Rochambeau|Rochambeau]]. During the following year, he was third in command of the French forces engaged at the decisive [[Siege of Yorktown]] in 1781 where the British were ultimately defeated. Major General de Chastellux was fluent in English and with his strong ideological support of the American cause, he served the alliance well. During the latter part of the campaign he was the principal liaison officer between George Washington and French general Rochambeau. Thereafter, Chastellux remained a personal friend of [[George Washington]] for life. Furthermore, the College of William and Mary and the University of Pennsylvania also awarded Chastellux with honorary degrees. After his return to France, Chastellux also remained in contact with [[Thomas Jefferson]], now the American representative in Paris, whom he had previously visited on his Virginia estate at [[Monticello]]. He was elected both a Foreign Honorary Member of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]],&lt;ref name=AAAS&gt;{{cite web|title=Book of Members, 1780–2010: Chapter C|url=http://www.amacad.org/publications/BookofMembers/ChapterC.pdf|publisher=American Academy of Arts and Sciences|accessdate=28 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and of the [[American Philosophical Society]]&lt;ref name=aps&gt;{{ cite journal|author=J.

==His late literary career==
Major General de Chastellux placed on record and published in 1786 his complete recollections of the American War of Independence. This included a description of his travels in America after the war had ended. Chastellux described [[George Washington]] as an effective yet profoundly human leader in wartime.

His most notable contribution to scholarship was a defense of [[Christian metaphysics]] in response to the charge of people like [[G.E. Moore]] and [[Bertrand Russell]] that Christian claims are linguistically meaningless and should be rejected as such. Ferre argued that Christian [[metaphysics]] was legitimate because it passed a fourfold test of a metaphysical worldview, being consistent, coherent, applicable, and adequate.

'''Johann Christoph Friedrich von Schiller''' ({{IPA-de|ˈjoːhan ˈkʁɪstɔf ˈfʁiːdʁɪç fɔn ˈʃɪlɐ|lang}}; 10 November 1759{{spaced ndash}}9 May 1805) was a [[Germans|German]] poet, philosopher, physician, historian, and playwright. During the last seventeen years of his life (1788–1805), Schiller struck up a productive, if complicated, friendship with the already famous and influential [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe]]. They frequently discussed issues concerning [[aesthetics]], and Schiller encouraged Goethe to finish works he left as sketches. This relationship and these discussions led to a period now referred to as [[Weimar Classicism]]. They also worked together on ''[[Xenien]]'', a collection of short satirical poems in which both Schiller and Goethe challenge opponents of their philosophical vision.

==Early life and career==
Friedrich Schiller was born on 10 November 1759, in [[Marbach am Neckar|Marbach]], [[Duchy of Württemberg|Württemberg]], as the only son of military doctor {{ill|Johann Kaspar Schiller|de}} (1733–1796) and {{ill|Elisabetha Dorothea Schiller|de|lt=Elisabeth Dorothea Kodweiß}} (1732–1802). They also had five daughters, including [[Christophine Reinwald|Christophine]], the eldest. Schiller grew up in a very religious family and spent much of his youth studying the Bible, which would later influence his writing for the theatre.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Frederich Schiller|last = Simons|first = John D|journal = Dictionary of Literary Biography, Volume 94: German Writers in the Age of Goethe: Sturm und Drang to Classicism|date = 1990|isbn= 9780810345744 }}&lt;/ref&gt; His father was away in the [[Seven Years' War]] when Friedrich was born. He was named after king [[Frederick the Great]], but he was called Fritz by nearly everyone.{{sfn|Lahnstein|1984|p=18}} Kaspar Schiller was rarely home during the war, but he did manage to visit the family once in a while. His wife and children also visited him occasionally wherever he happened to be stationed.{{sfn|Lahnstein|1984|p=20}} When the war ended in 1763, Schiller's father became a recruiting officer and was stationed in [[Schwäbisch Gmünd]]. The family moved with him. Due to the high cost of living—especially the rent—the family moved to the nearby [[Lorch (Württemberg)|Lorch]].{{sfn|Lahnstein|1984|pp=20–21}}

Although the family was happy in Lorch, Schiller's father found his work unsatisfying. He sometimes took his son with him.{{sfn|Lahnstein|1984|p=23}} In Lorch, Schiller received his primary education. The quality of the lessons was fairly bad, and Friedrich regularly cut class with his older sister.{{sfn|Lahnstein|1984|p=24}} Because his parents wanted Schiller to become a pastor, they had the pastor of the village instruct the boy in [[Latin]] and [[Greek language|Greek]]. Pastor Moser was a good teacher, and later Schiller named the cleric in his first play ''Die Räuber'' (''[[The Robbers]]'') after him. As a boy, Schiller was excited by the idea of becoming a cleric and often put on black robes and pretended to preach.{{sfn|Lahnstein|1984|p=25}}

In 1766, the family left Lorch for the Duke of Württemberg's principal residence, [[Ludwigsburg]]. Schiller's father had not been paid for three years, and the family had been living on their savings but could no longer afford to do so. So Kaspar Schiller took an assignment to the garrison in Ludwigsburg.{{sfn|Lahnstein|1984|p=27}}
[[File:Gerhard von Kügelgen 001.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Portrait of Friedrich Schiller by [[Gerhard von Kügelgen]]]]
There the boy Schiller came to the attention of [[Charles Eugene, Duke of Württemberg|Karl Eugen, Duke of Württemberg]]. He entered the [[Karlsschule Stuttgart]] (an elite military academy founded by the Duke), in 1773, where he eventually studied medicine. During most of his short life, he suffered from illnesses that he tried to cure himself.

While at the Karlsschule, Schiller read [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau|Rousseau]] and Goethe and discussed Classical ideals with his classmates. At school, he wrote his first play, ''The Robbers'', which dramatizes the conflict between two aristocratic brothers: the elder, Karl Moor, leads a group of rebellious students into the Bohemian forest where they become Robin Hood-like bandits, while Franz Moor, the younger brother, schemes to inherit his father's considerable estate. The play's critique of social corruption and its affirmation of proto-revolutionary republican ideals astounded its original audience. Schiller became an overnight sensation. Later, Schiller would be made an honorary member of the French Republic because of this play. The play was inspired by [[Johann Anton Leisewitz|Leisewitz']] earlier play ''[[Julius of Tarent]]'', a favourite of the young Schiller.&lt;ref name="britannica-Leisewitz" /&gt;

In 1780, he obtained a post as regimental doctor in [[Stuttgart]], a job he disliked. In order to attend the first performance of ''The Robbers'' in [[Mannheim]], Schiller left his regiment without permission. As a result, he was arrested, sentenced to 14 days of imprisonment, and forbidden by Karl Eugen from publishing any further works.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://studiocleo.com/librarie/schiller/biography.html |title=Friedrich Schiller biography |publisher=Studiocleo.com |date= |accessdate=6 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He fled Stuttgart in 1782, going via [[Frankfurt]], Mannheim, [[Leipzig]], and [[Dresden]] to [[Weimar]]. Along this journey he had an affair with an army officer's wife [[Charlotte von Kalb]]. She was at the centre of an intellectual circle, and she was known for her cleverness and instability. Schiller needed help  from his family and friends to extricate himself from his financial situation and attachment to a married woman.&lt;ref name=brit&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/527354/Friedrich-Schiller Friedrich Schiller], ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]'', retrieved 17 March 2014&lt;/ref&gt; Schiller settled in Weimar in 1787. In 1789, he was appointed professor of History and Philosophy in [[Jena]], where he wrote only historical works. He was ennobled in 1802, thereby adding the honorific ''von'' to his name&lt;ref name='brit'/&gt;.

==Marriage and family==
[[File:Friedrich Schiller, German Poet and Surgeon 100th Death Anniversary Medal Vienna 1905, obverse.jpg|thumb|Medal by {{ill|Stefan Schwartz (sculptor)|de|Stefan Schwartz|lt=Stefan Schwartz}} to his 100th Death Anniversary, after a sculpture of 1794 by [[Johann Heinrich von Dannecker|Dannecker]], Vienna 1905, obverse]]
On 22 February 1790, Schiller married [[Charlotte von Lengefeld]] (1766–1826). Two sons (Karl Friedrich Ludwig and Ernst Friedrich Wilhelm) and two daughters (Karoline Luise Henriette and Luise Henriette Emilie) were born between 1793 and 1804. The last living descendant of Schiller was a grandchild of Emilie, Baron Alexander von Gleichen-Rußwurm, who died at [[Baden-Baden]], Germany, in 1947.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.schillersgeburtshaus.de/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=56&amp;Itemid=54&amp;lang=de Schiller's offspring] at the Schiller Birth House Museum's site&lt;/ref&gt;

==Weimar and later career==

Schiller returned with his family to Weimar from Jena in 1799. Goethe convinced him to return to playwriting. He and Goethe founded the [[Deutsches Nationaltheater and Staatskapelle Weimar|Weimar Theater]], which became the leading theater in Germany. Their collaboration helped lead to a renaissance of drama in Germany.

For his achievements, Schiller was [[Nobility|ennobled]] in 1802 by the Duke of Saxe-Weimar, adding the nobiliary particle "[[von]]" to his name. He remained in Weimar, [[Saxe-Weimar]] until his death at 45 from [[tuberculosis]] in 1805.

==Legacy and honors==
[[File:Schiller edit1.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Lithography|Lithograph]] portrait from 1905, captioned "Friedrich von Schiller" in recognition of his 1802 ennoblement]]
The first authoritative biography of Schiller was by his sister-in-law [[Caroline von Wolzogen]] in 1830, ''{{Lang|de|Schillers Leben}}'' (Schiller's Life).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sharpe|first=Lesley|date=April 1999|title=Female Illness and Male Heroism: The Works of Caroline von Wolzogen|journal=German Life and Letters|volume=52|issue=2|pages=184–196|doi=10.1111/1468-0483.00129}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The coffin containing what was purportedly Schiller's skeleton was brought in 1827 into the [[Weimarer Fürstengruft]] (Weimar's Ducal Vault), the burial place of the house of [[Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach]] in the [[Historical Cemetery, Weimar|Historical Cemetery of Weimar]] and later also Goethe's resting place. On 3 May 2008, scientists announced that DNA tests have shown that the [[Friedrich Schiller's skull|skull of this skeleton]] is not Schiller's, and his tomb is now vacant.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spiegel.de/kultur/literatur/0,1518,551284,00.html "Schädel in Schillers Sarg wurde ausgetauscht" (Skull in Schiller's coffin has been exchanged)], ''[[Der Spiegel]]'', 3 May 2008.&lt;br /&gt;[https://www.welt.de/kultur/article1962670/Schaedel_in_Weimar_gehoert_nicht_Schiller.html "Schädel in Weimar gehört nicht Schiller" (Skull in Weimar does not belong to Schiller)], ''[[Die Welt]]'', 3 May 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; The physical resemblance between this skull and the extant [[death mask]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sammlungen.hu-berlin.de/dokumente/7882/ |title=Death Mask |publisher=Sammlungen.hu-berlin.de |date= |accessdate=6 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as to portraits of Schiller, had led many experts to believe that the skull was Schiller's.

[[File:Stuttgart-schillerplatz-2.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Germany's oldest Schiller memorial (1839) on Schillerplatz, Stuttgart]]
The city of Stuttgart erected in 1839 a statue in his memory on a square renamed [[Schillerplatz (Stuttgart)|Schillerplatz]]. A [[Schiller Monument (Berlin)|Schiller monument]] was unveiled on Berlin's [[Gendarmenmarkt]] in 1871.

Friedrich Schiller, the German poet, philosopher, historian, and dramatist, statue on Belle Isle in Detroit Michigan. This statue of the German poet and playwright was commissioned by Detroit's German-American community in 1908 at a cost of $12,000; the designer was Herman Matzen.

His image appeared on the [[German Democratic Republic]] 10 Mark banknotes of the 1964 emission.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.banknote.ws/COLLECTION/countries/EUR/GDR/GDR0023.htm German Democratic Republic, 10 Mark der DDR 1964], Banknote.ws&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2008, Schiller was voted by the audience of the TV channel [[Arte]] as the second most important playwright in Europe after [[William Shakespeare]].

===Freemasonry===
Some Freemasons speculate that Schiller was a [[Freemasonry|Freemason]], but this has not been proven.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://freemasonry.bcy.ca/biography/schiller_f/schiller_f.html |title=Friedrich Von Schiller |publisher=Freemasonry.bcy.ca |date= |accessdate=6 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1787, in his tenth letter about ''[[Don Carlos (play)|Don Carlos]]'', Schiller wrote:
{{quote|I am neither [[Illuminati]] nor Mason, but if the fraternization has a moral purpose in common with one another, and if this purpose for human society is the most important, ...&lt;ref name=IFL&gt;Eugen Lennhoff, Oskar Posner, Dieter A. Binder: ''Internationales Freimaurer Lexikon''. Herbig publishing, 2006, {{ISBN|978-3-7766-2478-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In a letter from 1829, two Freemasons from [[Rudolstadt]] complain about the dissolving of their Lodge ''Günther zum stehenden Löwen'' that was honoured by the initiation of Schiller. According to Schiller's great-grandson Alexander von Gleichen-Rußwurm, Schiller was brought to the Lodge by ''Wilhelm Heinrich Karl von Gleichen-Rußwurm''. No membership document has been found.&lt;ref name=IFL /&gt;

===Philosophical papers===

The statue is on a stone pedestal, which has a plaque that reads "Dem Dichterpaar/Goethe und Schiller/das Vaterland".]]
Schiller wrote many philosophical papers on ethics and [[aesthetics]]. He synthesized the thought of [[Immanuel Kant]] with the thought of the [[German idealism|German Idealist]] philosopher, [[Karl Leonhard Reinhold]]. He elaborated [[Christoph Martin Wieland]]'s concept of ''{{Lang|de|die schöne Seele}}'' (the beautiful soul), a human being whose emotions have been educated by reason, so that ''{{Lang|de|Pflicht und Neigung}}'' (duty and inclination) are no longer in conflict with one another; thus beauty, for Schiller, is not merely an aesthetic experience, but a moral one as well: the Good is the Beautiful. The link between morality and aesthetics also occurs in Schiller's controversial poem, "[[Die Götter Griechenlandes]] (The Gods of Greece)." The "gods" in Schiller's poem are thought by modern scholars to represent moral and aesthetic values, which Schiller tied to [[Paganism]] and an idea of [[animism|enchanted nature]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last = Josephson-Storm | first = Jason | title = The Myth of Disenchantment: Magic, Modernity, and the Birth of the Human Sciences | location = Chicago | publisher = University of Chicago Press | date = 2017 |page = 82-3 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=xZ5yDgAAQBAJ | isbn = 0-226-40336-X }}&lt;/ref&gt; In this respect, Schiller's aesthetic doctrine shows the influence of [[Theosophy (Boehmian)|Christian Theosophy]].&lt;ref&gt;Josephson-Storm (2017), 81.&lt;/ref&gt;

There is general consensus among scholars that it makes sense to think of Schiller as a [[liberalism|liberal]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Martin |first1=Nicholas |title=Schiller: A Birmingham Symposium |date=2006 |publisher=Rodopi |page=257}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Gray |first1=John |title=Liberalism |date=1995 |publisher=U of Minnesota Press |page=33}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Sharpe |first1=Lesley |title=Friedrich Schiller: Drama, Thought and Politics |date=1991 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; and he is frequently cited as a [[cosmopolitanism|cosmopolitan]] thinker.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Bell |first1=Duncan |title=Ethics and World Politics |date=2010 |publisher=Oxford University Press |page=147}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Sanahuja |first1=Lorena Cebolla |last2=Ghia |first2=Francesco |title=Cosmopolitanism: Between Ideals and Reality |date=2015 |publisher=Cambridge Scholars Publishing |page=43-44}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Cavallar |first1=Georg |title=Imperfect Cosmopolis: Studies in the history of international legal theory and cosmopolitan ideas |date=2011 |publisher=University of Wales Press |page=41}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Sharpe |first1=Lesley |title=Schiller's Aesthetic Essays: Two Centuries of Criticism |date=1995 |publisher=Camden House |page=58}}&lt;/ref&gt; Schiller's philosophical work was particularly concerned with the question of human freedom, a preoccupation which also guided his historical researches, such as the [[Thirty Years' War]] and the [[Dutch Revolt]], and then found its way as well into his dramas (the [[Wallenstein (trilogy of plays)|''Wallenstein'' trilogy]] concerns the Thirty Years' War, while ''Don Carlos'' addresses the revolt of the Netherlands against Spain.) Schiller wrote two important essays on the question of the sublime (''{{Lang|de|das Erhabene}}''), entitled "{{Lang|de|Vom Erhabenen}}" and "{{Lang|de|Über das Erhabene}}"; these essays address one aspect of human freedom—the ability to defy one's animal instincts, such as the drive for self-preservation, when, for example, someone willingly sacrifices themselves for conceptual ideals.

===Dramas===
Schiller is considered by most Germans to be Germany's most important classical playwright. Critics like F.J. Lamport and Eric Auerbach have noted his innovative use of dramatic structure and his creation of new forms, such as the melodrama and the bourgeois tragedy. What follows is a brief, chronological description of the plays.
* ''[[The Robbers]]'' (''Die Räuber''): The language of ''The Robbers'' is highly emotional, and the depiction of physical violence in the play marks it as a quintessential work of Germany's [[Romanticism|Romantic]] ''[[Sturm und Drang]]'' movement. ''The Robbers'' is considered by critics like [[Peter Brooks (writer)|Peter Brooks]] to be the first European [[melodrama]]. The play pits two brothers against each other in alternating scenes, as one quests for money and power, while the other attempts to create revolutionary anarchy in the [[Bohemian Forest]]. The play strongly criticises the hypocrisies of class and religion, and the economic inequities of German society; it also conducts a complicated inquiry into the nature of evil. Schiller was inspired by the play ''[[Julius of Tarent]]'' by [[Johann Anton Leisewitz]].&lt;ref name="britannica-Leisewitz"&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/335498/Johann-Anton-Leisewitz?anchor=ref141414 "Johann Anton Leisewitz"], ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]''&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''[[Fiesco (play)|Fiesco]]'' (''Die Verschwörung des Fiesco zu Genua''):
* ''[[Intrigue and Love]]'' (''Kabale und Liebe''): The aristocratic Ferdinand von Walter wishes to marry Luise Miller, the bourgeois daughter of the city's music instructor. Court politics involving the duke's beautiful but conniving mistress Lady Milford and Ferdinand's ruthless father create a disastrous situation reminiscent of Shakespeare's ''[[Romeo and Juliet]]''. Schiller develops his criticisms of absolutism and bourgeois hypocrisy in this [[bourgeois tragedy]]. Act 2, scene 2 is an anti-British [[parody]] that depicts a firing-squad massacre. Young Germans who refused to join the [[Hessian (soldiers)|Hessians]] and British to quash the [[American Revolutionary War]] are fired upon.&lt;ref name=Ode&gt;''The Autobiography of Col. John Trumbull'', Sizer 1953 ed., p. 184, n. 13&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''[[Don Carlos (play)|Don Carlos]]'': This play marks Schiller's entrée into historical drama. Very loosely based on the events surrounding the real [[Carlos, Prince of Asturias|Don Carlos]] of Spain, Schiller's Don Carlos is another republican figure—he attempts to free Flanders from the despotic grip of his father, King [[Philip II of Spain|Phillip]]. The Marquis Posa's famous speech to the king proclaims Schiller's belief in personal freedom and democracy.
* The [[Wallenstein (trilogy of plays)|''Wallenstein'' trilogy]]: Consisting of ''Wallenstein's Camp'', ''The Piccolomini'', and ''Wallenstein's Death'', these plays follow the fortunes of the treacherous commander [[Albrecht von Wallenstein]] during the [[Thirty Years' War]].
* ''[[Mary Stuart (play)|Mary Stuart]]'' (''Maria Stuart''): This history of the Scottish queen, who was Elizabeth I's rival, portrays Mary Stuart as a tragic heroine, misunderstood and used by ruthless politicians, including and especially, Elizabeth.
* ''[[The Maid of Orleans (play)|The Maid of Orleans]]'' (''Die Jungfrau von Orleans''): about [[Joan of Arc]]
* ''[[The Bride of Messina]]'' (''Die Braut von Messina'')
* ''[[William Tell (play)|William Tell]]'' (''Wilhelm Tell'')
* ''[[Demetrius (play)|Demetrius]]'' (unfinished)

===''Aesthetic Letters''===
{{main article|Play drive}}
A pivotal work by Schiller was ''[[On the Aesthetic Education of Man]] in a Series of Letters''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/mod/schiller-education.html "Letters Upon The Aesthetic Education of Man"], [[Fordham University]]&lt;/ref&gt; (''Über die ästhetische Erziehung des Menschen in einer Reihe von Briefen''), first published 1794, which was inspired by the great disenchantment Schiller felt about the [[French Revolution]], its degeneration into violence and the failure of successive governments to put its ideals into practice.&lt;ref&gt;Schiller, ''On the Aesthetic Education of Man'', ed. Elizabeth M. Wilkinson and [[L. A. Willoughby]], 1967&lt;/ref&gt; Schiller wrote that "a great moment has found a little people"; he wrote the ''Letters'' as a philosophical inquiry into what had gone wrong, and how to prevent such tragedies in the future. In the ''Letters'' he asserts that it is possible to elevate the moral character of a people, by first touching their souls with beauty, an idea that is also found in his poem ''Die Künstler'' (''The Artists''): "Only through Beauty's morning-gate, dost thou penetrate the land of knowledge."

On the philosophical side, ''Letters'' put forth the notion of ''der sinnliche Trieb / Sinnestrieb'' ("the sensuous drive") and ''Formtrieb'' ("the formal drive"). In a comment to [[Immanuel Kant]]'s philosophy, Schiller transcends the dualism between ''Formtrieb'' and ''Sinnestrieb'' with the notion of ''Spieltrieb'' ("the [[play drive]]"), derived from, as are a number of other terms, Kant's ''[[Critique of Judgment|Critique of the Faculty of Judgment]]''. The conflict between man's material, sensuous nature and his capacity for reason (''Formtrieb'' being the drive to impose conceptual and moral order on the world), Schiller resolves with the happy union of ''Formtrieb'' and ''Sinnestrieb'', the "play drive," which for him is synonymous with artistic beauty, or "living form." On the basis of ''Spieltrieb'', Schiller sketches in ''Letters'' a future ''ideal state'' (a [[utopia|eutopia]]), where everyone will be content, and everything will be beautiful, thanks to the free play of ''Spieltrieb''. Schiller's focus on the dialectical interplay between ''Formtrieb'' and ''Sinnestrieb'' has inspired a wide range of succeeding aesthetic philosophical theory, including notably [[Jacques Rancière]]'s conception of the "aesthetic regime of art," as well as social philosophy in [[Herbert Marcuse]]. In the second part of his important work ''[[Eros and Civilization]]'', Marcuse finds Schiller's notion of ''Spieltrieb'' useful in thinking a social situation without the condition of modern [[social alienation]]. He writes, "Schiller's ''Letters'' ... aim at remaking of civilization by virtue of the liberating force of the aesthetic function: it is envisaged as containing the possibility of a new reality principle."&lt;ref&gt;[[Herbert Marcuse|Marcuse, Herbert]]. ''[[Eros and Civilization]]''. Beacon Press. 1966&lt;/ref&gt;

==Musical settings==
[[Ludwig van Beethoven]] said that a great poem is more difficult to set to music than a merely good one because the composer must rise higher than the poet – "who can do that in the case of Schiller? In this respect Goethe is much easier," wrote Beethoven.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Beethoven: the man and the artist, as revealed by his own words, Project Gutenberg.|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/files/3528/3528-h/3528-h.htm|accessdate=20 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are relatively few famous musical settings of Schiller's poems.

The Italian composer [[Giuseppe Verdi]] admired Schiller greatly and adapted several of his stage plays for his operas: ''[[I masnadieri]]'' is based on ''[[The Robbers]]''; ''[[Giovanna d'Arco]]'' on ''[[The Maid of Orleans (play)|The Maid of Orleans]]''; ''[[Luisa Miller]]'' on ''[[Intrigue and Love]]''; ''[[La forza del destino]]'' is based partly on [[Wallenstein (play)|Wallenstein]]; and ''[[Don Carlos]]'' on the [[Don Carlos (play)|play of the same title]]. [[Gaetano Donizetti|Donizetti's]] ''[[Maria Stuarda]]'' is based on ''[[Mary Stuart (play)|Mary Stuart]]'', and [[Gioachino Rossini|Rossini's]] ''[[William Tell (opera)|Guillaume Tell]]'' is an adaptation of ''[[William Tell (play)|William Tell]]''. [[Nicola Vaccai]]'s ''Giovanna d'Arco'' (1827) is based on ''The Maid of Orleans'' and his ''La sposa di Messina'' (1839) on ''The Bride of Messina''. [[Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky|Tchaikovsky]]'s 1881 opera ''[[The Maid of Orleans (opera)|The Maid of Orleans]]'' is partly based on Schiller's work. The 20th-century composer [[Giselher Klebe]] adapted ''The Robbers'' for his first opera of [[Die Räuber (opera)|the same name]], which premiered in 1957.

==Schiller's burial==
A poem written about the poet's burial:

{{poemquote|
Two dim and paltry torches that the raging storm
And rain at any moment threaten to put out.
A waving pall. A vulgar coffin made of pine
With not a wreath, not e'en the poorest, and no train –
As if a crime were swiftly carried to the grave!
The bearers hastened onward. One unknown alone,
Round whom a mantle waved of wide and noble fold,
Followed this coffin. 'Twas the Spirit of Mankind.|[[Conrad Ferdinand Meyer]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Munsterberg|first=Margarete|title=A Harvest of German Verse|year=1916|publisher=D. Appleton and Company|location=New York and London|page=242}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In ''[[Being and Time]]'', Martin Heidegger made the distinction between [[ontic]]al and [[ontological]]. Ontical refers to a particular area of [[Being]], whereas ontological ought to refer to Being as such. The history of [[ontology]] in [[Western Philosophy]] is, in Heidegger's terms, properly speaking, ontical, and ontology ought to designate fundamental ontology. He says "Ontological inquiry is indeed more primordial, as over against the ontical inquiry of the positive sciences".&lt;ref&gt;Martin Heidegger, ''Being and Time'', §3.&lt;/ref&gt; It is from this distinction he developed his project of '''fundamental ontology''' (German: ''Fundamental ontologie'')
==Background==
The project of '''fundamental ontology''' appeared as a result of [[Heidegger]]'s decision to re-interpret [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]], which he had developed earlier in collaboration with his mentor [[Edmund Husserl]], using a neat set of ontological [[Category of being|categories]].

For this project Heidegger had to look for new terminologies by means of which it would become possible for him adequately to represent the structure of his new brand of phenomenology. The significantly large change in terminology Heidegger made in the project also resulted in a reconsideration and redefinition of many traditional concepts. For instance, the thesis that a [[phenomenon]] is the [[essence]] of a thing could not be articulated by using traditional concepts alone; in fact, Heidegger consistently refused to use these concepts in their original (i.e. Husserl's) senses. He re-interpreted such basic philosophical categories as "subject", "object", "spirit", "body", "consciousness", "reality" and others with a new emphasis on Being (German: ''[[:wikt:sein#German|Sein]]''), showing their inadequacy for his new philosophical explorations.

Moreover, Heidegger went on to separate his pursuit of "ontology" from the kinds of inquiry that previous researches of "essence" had conducted under the same label, which henceforth, according to Heidegger, should be engaged only in particular fields of science. For Heidegger, the ontical forms of research conducted by scientists presuppose the regional-ontological, which in turn presupposes the fundamental-ontological. As he expresses it:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The question of Being aims… at ascertaining the ''a priori'' conditions not only for the possibility of the sciences which examine beings as beings of such and such a type, and, in doing so, already operate with an understanding of Being, but also for the possibility of those ontologies themselves which are prior to the ontical sciences and which provide their foundations. ''Basically, all ontology, no matter how rich and firmly compacted a system of categories it has at its disposal, remains blind and perverted from its ownmost aim, if it has not first adequately clarified the meaning of Being, and conceived this clarification as its fundamental task''.&lt;ref&gt;Martin Heidegger, ''Being and Time'', §3.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Earlier philosophers, namely ancient ones,&lt;ref&gt;Martin Heidegger, ''Being and Time'', §1.&lt;/ref&gt; have stated that only in phenomenon was it possible to posit the essence of things. Thus the phenomenon was opposed to essence, and it was the moment of opposition of the subject and object. Husserl had differentiated his new notion of phenomenon from the traditionally accepted notion of phenomenon as "occurrence". The notion of "phenomenon" as introduced by Husserl in his phenomenology carries in itself the two faces of things: phenomenon as "representation of the world as it is reflected in consciousness" and the essence of a thing "as it is in itself". In Husserl's belief, 'phenomenon' as he defined it appeared comprehensive and sufficient for his philosophical ventures. Husserl's perspective, as Heidegger saw it, left some room for new development in phenomenology: bringing "ontology" into "phenomenology" with a new force. For Heidegger, Husserl's ideas were "in exile" with their [[Transcendental idealism|transcendental]] tendency, because they were exclusively concerned with [[consciousness]], and they had to be "thrown" back into the historical, external world. From the Heidegger's point of view the attempt of his mentor to design and save life only inside human consciousness, i.e. "the world above" of the transcendental ego, was not sufficient. Thus, the first task that Heidegger took on was to work out how to refute Husserl's [[immanence]] of [[consciousness]] while preserving all the achievements of his mentor's [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]].

On the other hand, why did Heidegger want to base his "new phenomenology" only on the category of Being, and to set as his task a formulation and proof of it? Answering this question, he again refers to the phenomenological maxim: without any intention to address directly "things" (German: ''zur Sache selbst''), then what kind of intellectual outlook will be at all possible? To Heidegger the necessary focus is clear: Being in its various forms. Really, I exist, things surrounding me exist, and people surrounding me exist. Here it is important to understand that being is primary; things, I, and people, for instance, are all forms of being. Being reveals itself first of all in its multiplicity, in the form of separate essences (German: ''Seiendes'').

Today there are only two ontological alternatives in philosophy: the "objectivistic" variant of philosophy which was carefully developed by [[Nicolai Hartmann]], - and the "subjectivistic" '''fundamental ontology''' of Heidegger. For a variety of reasons, recently, the majority of philosophers give preference to the second, to Heidegger's alternative{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}.

==Relationship with Dasein==
Heidegger argues “Dasein is an entity which does not just occur among other entities. Rather it is ontically distinguished by the fact that, in its very Being, that Being is an issue for it”.&lt;ref&gt;Martin Heidegger, ''Being and Time'', §4.&lt;/ref&gt; Human beings are in a privileged position to understand Fundamental Ontology.

'''''God and Sex: What the Bible Really Says''''' is a book by Professor [[Michael Coogan]], published in 2010.&lt;ref name=warner&gt;Jessica Warner [https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/arts/books/god-and-sex-what-the-bible-really-says-by-michael-coogan/article1835995/ "Sex and the biblical scholar"], ''The Globe and Mail'', December 14, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=trible&gt;[[Phyllis Trible]], [http://www.bib-arch.org/reviews/review-god-and-sex.asp "God and Sex: What the Bible Really Says"], ''[[Biblical Archaeology Review]]'', 20 January 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=stonehillcoll&gt;[http://www.stonehill.edu/x22571.xml "New Book by Professor Michael Coogan Examines Sex in the Bible"], Stonehill College, September 29, 2010, new URL: archive dot today/BOYC {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101128044310/http://www.stonehill.edu/x22571.xml |date=November 28, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Coogan {{clarify span|asserts|date=September 2016}} that, in the [[Hebrew Bible]], there is no prohibition of premarital or extramarital [[sexual intercourse|sex]] for men, except for [[adultery]], i.e. sleeping with the wife of another man.&lt;ref name=coogan&gt;[http://www.summitstonehill.com/opinion/5-questions-with-professor-michael-d-coogan-1.1716380 5 Questions with Professor Michael D. Coogan] The Summit, October 19, 2010. New URL: http://admin2.collegepublisher.com/se/the-summit/opinion/5-questions-with-professor-michael-d-coogan-1.1716380 {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110919213022/http://www.summitstonehill.com/opinion/5-questions-with-professor-michael-d-coogan-1.1716380 |date=September 19, 2011 }}. Quote: "In ancient Israel, premarital sex by a woman was discouraged because in the patriarchal society of that time, a daughter was her father's property. If she was not a virgin her value--the bride price her father would get from a prospective husband--was diminished. Also, any child born to an unmarried woman would be fatherless--the Biblical term is "orphan"-- and so without either a male protector or any possibility of an inheritance, which was passed from father to son. There is no explicit prohibition in the Old Testament of premarital or extramarital sex by men except for adultery, which meant having sex with another man's wife."&lt;/ref&gt;

Coogan affirms that premarital sex for women was "discouraged",&lt;ref name=coogan/&gt; but the [[Bible]] has a word for the sons of unmarried women,&lt;ref name=coogan/&gt; i.e. they were allowed to give birth to such sons, although their sons were relegated to an inferior social status.&lt;ref name=coogan/&gt; He also claims that [[Paul the Apostle]] condemned extramarital sex out of [[apocalypticism|apocalyptic]] fears (he thought that the world was going to end soon)&lt;ref name=coogan/&gt; and that [[Jesus]] does not say anything about this,&lt;ref name=coogan/&gt; except regulating [[divorce]] between a man and one of his wives. Coogan does use therein the singular ("wife"), but does not say that a man could have only one wife, since Jesus was therein discussing the Law of [[Moses]], which allowed for [[polygamy]].

Interviewed by ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine about this book, he also says that words often translated in the Bible as "[[sodomy]]" have often nothing to do with [[homosexuality|anal intercourse between men]],&lt;ref name=silver/&gt; and that according to [[Sola Scriptura]], the [[Mormons]] were right about [[polygamy]].&lt;ref name=silver&gt;Alexandra Silver [http://www.time.com/time/nation/article/0,8599,2027582,00.html What the Bible Has to Say About Sex] Time.com, October 31, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
The book was well received by Jessica Warner, from the [[University of Toronto]],&lt;ref name=warner/&gt; but was criticized by Prof. [[Phyllis Trible]], from [[Wake Forest University School of Divinity]] in [[North Carolina]]. Trible asserts that [[patriarchy]] was not decreed by [[God]] but only described by him, it being specific for humans after the fall, and claims that [[Saint Paul]] made the same mistake as Coogan in this respect.&lt;ref name=trible/&gt; The Catholic apologist [[Robert Sungenis]] strongly denounced both the book and the author on numerous other grounds.&lt;ref name=Sungenis&gt;Robert Sungenis, Sr., PhD [http://www.catholicintl.com/images/stories/Book_Review_of_God_and_Sex.pdf Book Review of: God and Sex: What the Bible Really Says]{{dead link|date=September 2014}}, ''Culture Wars'', January 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

The book was reviewed by ABC Radio National&lt;ref name=kohn&gt;Rachael Kohn [http://www.abc.net.au/radionational/programs/spiritofthings/the-worlds-sexiest-book/3689312 The World's Sexiest Book]. The Spirit of Things. ABC Radio National, 15 January 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; which claimed that "Michael Coogan is one of the leading Biblical scholars in the US, and in his book ''God and Sex: What the Bible Really Says'', he reveals all, including whether David loved Jonathan in that way."&lt;ref name=kohn/&gt;

CNN gave Coogan the chance to present his book on its website.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Coogan [http://edition.cnn.com/2010/OPINION/10/26/coogan.bible.family.values/ Bible has some shocking 'family values'] CNN.com, 2010-10-26.&lt;/ref&gt; Newsweek also had an article about this book.&lt;ref&gt;Lisa Miller, [http://www.newsweek.com/what-bible-really-says-about-sex-68665 What the Bible Really Says About Sex], Newsweek, 6 February 2011&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Young Turks]]'' presented an interview with Coogan upon this book.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6VMFjKaCc4 The Young Turks] December 21, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Heidegger Gesamtausgabe''''' is the term for the collected works of German philosopher [[Martin Heidegger]], edited by [[Verlag Vittorio Klostermann|Vittorio Klostermann]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.klostermann.de/philo/phi_hei.htm Vittorio Klostermann]&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Gesamtausgabe'' was begun during Heidegger's lifetime. He defined the order of publication and controversially dictated that the principle of editing should be "ways not works." Publication has not yet been completed.

'''Infosphere''' is a [[neologism]] composed of [[information]] and [[sphere]]. The word refers to an environment, like a biosphere, that is populated by informational entities called [[inforg]]s. While an example of the sphere of information is cyberspace, infospheres are not limited to purely online environments.

==History of the Infosphere==
The first documented use of the word "InfoSphere" was a 1971 Time Magazine book review by R.Z. Sheppard&lt;ref name=Time1971&gt;{{citation
 | author = R.Z. Sheppard
 | title = Rock Candy
 | magazine = Time Magazine
 | url = http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,905004,00.html
| date=1971-04-12
| accessdate=2010-05-05
}}&lt;/ref&gt; in which he writes "In much the way that fish cannot conceptualize water or birds the air, man barely understands his infosphere, that encircling layer of electronic and typographical smog composed of cliches from journalism, entertainment, advertising and government."

In 1980 it was used by [[Alvin Toffler]] in his book ''[[The Third Wave (Toffler book)|The Third Wave]]'' in which he writes "What is inescapably clear, whatever we choose to believe, is that we are altering our infosphere fundamentally...we are adding a whole new strata of communication to the social system.  The emerging Third Wave infosphere makes that of the Second Wave era - dominated by its mass media, the post office, and the telephone - seem hopelessly primitive by contrast".&lt;ref name=Toffler1980&gt;{{citation
 | author = Alvin Toffler
 | year = 1980
 | title = The Third Wave
 | page = 172
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Toffler definition proved prophetic as the use of "Infosphere" in the 1990s expanded beyond media to speculate about the common [[evolution]] of the [[Internet]], [[society]] and [[culture]]. 

In his book ''Digital Dharma'', Steven Vedro writes, "Emerging from what French philosopher-priest [[Pierre Teilhard de Chardin]] called the shared [[noosphere]] of collective human thought, invention and spiritual seeking,  the Infosphere is sometimes used to conceptualize a field that engulfs our physical, mental and etheric bodies; it affects our dreaming and our cultural life. Our evolving nervous system has been extended, as media sage [[Marshall McLuhan]] predicted in the early 1960s, into a global embrace."

The term has also been used by [[Luciano Floridi]], on the basis of [[biosphere]], to denote the whole informational environment constituted by all informational entities (thus including informational agents as well), their properties, interactions, processes and mutual relations.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author = Luciano Floridi | year = 1999 | title = Philosophy and Computing: An introduction}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is an environment comparable to, but different from [[cyberspace]] (which is only one of its sub-regions, as it were), since it also includes off-line and analogue spaces of information. According to Floridi, it is possible to equate the Infosphere to the totality of [[Being]]. This equation leads him to an informational ontology.

==Manipulation of the Infosphere==
The manipulation of the infosphere is subject to [[metaphysics]] and its rules. Information is considered to be [[Shannon information]] and is treated in a physical sense separate from energy and matter. The manipulations to the infosphere include the erasing, transfer, duplication, and destruction of information.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author = Charles Seife | year = 2006 | title = [[Decoding the Universe: How the New Science of Information Is Explaining Everything in the Cosmos, from Our Brains to Black Holes]] | page = 2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Publications using the Infosphere==
The term was used by [[Dan Simmons]] in the [[science-fiction]] saga [[Hyperion Cantos|Hyperion]] (published 1989) to indicate what the [[Internet]] could become in the future: a place parallel, virtual, formed of billions of networks, with "artificial life" on various scales, from what is equivalent to an insect (small programs) to what is equivalent to a god (artificial intelligences), whose motivations are diverse, seeking to both help mankind and harm it.

In the [[animated sitcom]] ''[[Futurama]]'', the Infosphere is a huge sphere floating in space, in which a species of giant, talking, floating brains attempts to store all of the information known in the universe.

==Other Uses==
The [[IBM]] Software Group created the [[IBM InfoSphere|InfoSphere brand]] in 2008 for its [[Information Management]] software products.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6954">'''James Morgan Pryse''' (14 November 1859 &amp;ndash; 22 April 1942) was an author, publisher, and [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|theosophist]].

[[Image:Emblema Teosófico XIX.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Emblem of the [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophical Society]]]]

==Family background==
Pryse was born in [[New London, Ohio]] (a suburb of Cincinnati), and died in Los Angeles, California.
 
Pryse married Jessica "Jessie" Mayer (died on Aug. 27, 1928) on Dec. 1, 1902 at Galesville, Trempealeau County, Wisconsin.

James had a brother named John Morgan Pryse (Sept. 9, 1863 - Sept. 5, 1952)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://vitals.rootsweb.ancestry.com/ca/death/search.cgi?surname=pryse&amp;given=john|title=California Death Records|publisher=Vitals.rootsweb.ancestry.com|accessdate=2 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; who died in Los Angeles and who was also a publisher and writer on esoteric subjects. 
 
James began his career in law, but gave it up for journalism. In adult life he travelled extensively, helping create a utopian colony in [[Topolobampo, Sinaloa|Topolobampo]], Mexico, and editing the Topolobampo periodical from his [[New Jersey]] home.

==Pryse brothers and the Theosophical Society==
James settled in Los Angeles, California, in 1886. He joined the Los Angeles branch of the  Theosophical Society on July 28, 1887. His brother John was already a member at that time. John later dropped out of the Theosophical Society and founded the [[Gnostic Society]] in 1928. The original headquarters of the Gnostic Society was in John's home in Los Angeles (address: 919 South Bernal Avenue, Los Angeles, California).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://theosophy.katinkahesselink.net/canadian/Vol-33-12-Theosophist.htm|title=Canadian Theosophist Archive|publisher=Theosophy.katinkahesselink.net|quote=Scroll down to the Obituary section on pp. 185-186 to read John M. Pryse's obituary|accessdate=2 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 1888 the Pryse brothers arrived in New York City. In 1889, members of the Theosophical Society from New York City and Chicago purchased a printing press and type, for the purpose of setting up a publishing company which would handle the publishing needs of the various branches of the Theosophical Society located in the United States. This theosophical publishing company, named the Aryan Press, was located at 144 Madison Avenue in Manhattan, New York City. James was recruited to set up and operate the Aryan Press, which was in full operation by December 1889.

Due to the success of the Aryan Press, a larger printing press was purchased and shipped to London, England. In August 1890, James was contacted by [[Helena Blavatsky]] (1831-1891) (co-founder of the Theosophical Society) and summoned to London, for the purpose of setting up and operating this new publishing company, known as the H. P. B. Press (Printers to the Theosophical Society). This printing press was also referred to as the "Blavatsky Press." James left New York City for London in September 1890, at which time his brother John took over operation of the Aryan Press. The H. P. B. Press (Blavatsky Press) was installed in London ( at 42 Henry Street, Regent's Park, London, N. W.) about November 1890.

Blavatsky had asked James to publish her ''Esoteric Instructions'' in the United States, so the work would be accessible to members of the American branches of the Theosophical Society.&lt;ref&gt;Boris de Zirkoff (1889). ''H. P. Blavatsky Collected Writings'', Vol. 12, p. 499. Quest Books.&lt;/ref&gt; Blavatsky's ''Esoteric Instructions'' was duly published by the Aryan Press in 1890.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.blavatskyarchives.com/hpbes1extract.htm|title=Extract from H.P.B.'s E.S.T.S. Instruction No. I|publisher=Blavatskyarchives.com|accessdate=2 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''The Apocalypse Unsealed'' (1910) Pryse published the secret key to decoding the esoteric meaning of the Biblical ''Book of Revelation''. His ''The Restored New Testament'' (1914) also shows esoteric meaning.&lt;ref name="Michael Wassil, 2002"&gt;Michael Wassil, ''Dance of Ecstasy'', 13 Mar 2011 &lt;www.dance-of-ecstasy.net&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Vajrayana}}
The '''''kīla''''' or '''''phurba''''' ([[Sanskrit]] [[Devanagari]]: कील; [[IAST]]: kīla; {{bo|t=ཕུར་བ|w=phur ba}},{{need IPA}} alternate [[transliteration]]s and English orthographies: ''phurpa'', ''phurbu'', ''purbha'', or ''phurpu'') is a three-sided peg, stake, [[knife]], or nail-like ritual implement traditionally associated with [[Tibetan Buddhism|Indo-Tibetan Buddhism]], [[Bön]], and Indian [[Vedic]] traditions. 

The ''kīla'' is associated with the [[Iṣṭha-deva(tā) (Buddhism)|meditational deity]] (Sanskrit: ''ishtadevata'', Tibetan ''yidam'') '''Vajrakīla''' (वज्रकील) or [http://www.rigpawiki.org/index.php?title=Vajrakilaya Vajrakīlaya] (Tibetan ''Dorje Phurba'') {{clarify|text=according to the "means for attainment" [[Mahayoga]] class. Vajrakilaya is the Buddha's activity natural expression representation.|date=October 2017}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Karma Lingpa |first1=Terton |title=The Tibetan Book of the Dead |date=January 30, 2007 |publisher=[[Penguin Classics]] |isbn=978-0143104940 |edition=First Complete |p=523}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
Most of what is known of the Indian kīla lore has come by way of Tibetan culture. Scholars such as F. A. Bischoff, Charles Hartman and Martin Boord have shown that the Tibetan literature widely asserts that the Sanskrit for their term ''phurba'' is ''kīlaya'' (with or without the long ''i''). However, as Boord describes it, "all dictionaries and Sanskrit works agree the word to be ''kīla'' (or ''kīlaka''). I suppose this [discrepancy] to result from an indiscriminate use by Tibetans of the dative singular ''kīlaya''. This form would have been familiar to them in the simple salutation ''namo vajrakīlaya'' (homage to Vajrakīla) from which it could easily be assumed by those unfamiliar with the technicalities of Sanskrit that the name of the deity is Vajrakīlaya instead of Vajrakīla. It should also be noted that the term ''(vajra)kīlaya'' is frequently found in Sanskrit texts (as well as in virtually every ''kīlamantra'') legitimately used as the denominative verb 'to spike,' 'transfix,' 'nail down,' etc."&lt;ref&gt;Boord, Martin (1993) ''Cult of the Deity Vajrakila'' Institute of Buddhist Studies {{ISBN|0-9515424-3-5}}; p. 5&lt;/ref&gt;

Mayer (1996) contests Boord's assertion, pointing out that eminent Sanskritists such as [[Sakya Pandita]] employed Vajrakīlaya.&lt;ref&gt;''A Scripture of the Ancient Tantra Collection: The Phur-pa bcu-gnyis'' by Robert Mayer Kindsdale Publications, 1996. {{ISBN|1-870838-52-1}} pg 165&lt;/ref&gt; Further, he argues:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
it is possible, on the other hand, that the name Vajrakīlaya as favoured by the Tibetans could in fact have been the form that was actually used in the original Indic sources, and that there is no need to hypothesize a correct form "Vajrakīla". "Vajrakīlaya" could have come from the second person singular active, causative imperative, of the verb ''Kīl''. Indigenous grammar (Pāṇini Dhātupāṭha I.557) gives to ''Kīl'' the meaning of ''bandha'', i.e. "to bind", while Monier-Williams (285) gives the meanings "to bind, fasten, stake, pin". Hence the form kīlaya could mean "you cause to bind/transfix!", or "bind/transfix!". This, taken from mantras urging "bind/transfix", or "may you cause to bind/transfix", might have come to be treated as a noun; and the noun might then have become deified; hence Kīlaya might have started out as a deified imperative, in some ways comparable to the famous example of the deified vocative in the name Hevajra, and a not unheard of phenomenon in Sanskrit tantric literature. This suggestion is supported by Alexis Sanderson, a specialist in Sanskrit tantric manuscripts whom I consulted on this problem.&lt;ref&gt;''A Scripture of the Ancient Tantra Collection: The Phur-pa bcu-gnyis'' by Robert Mayer Kindsdale Publications, 1996. {{ISBN|1-870838-52-1}} pg 165-6&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Both the above suggestions are ungrammatical and incorrect from the point of view of Sanskrit grammar.  Regarding the suggestion of Boord et al., the Sanskrit dative of ''kīla'' is ''kīlāya'', not ''kīlaya''.  Mayer's suggestion would require compounding a noun (''vajra'') and a nominal verb (''kīlayati'') which is not a licit formation in Sanskrit.  ''"Vajraṃ kīlaya''" is a possible expression, but that is not the form under discussion.  It seems possible to me that the Tibetan ''kīlaya'' is borrowed not from Sanskrit but from a Prakrit word ''kīlaya'' (&lt;Skt. ''kīlaka'').&lt;ref&gt;Personal comments by Dominik Wujastyk, 2018-03-13.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fabrication and components==
The fabrication of kīla is quite diverse. Having pommel, handle, and blade, kīla are often segmented into suites of [[triple deities|triunes]]&lt;ref&gt;Triunes that are metonymic of the ananda-chakra (Tib. ''[[gankyil]]''; the [[trishula]]; [[triratna]]; the heavenly, earthly and hellish realms; three eyes, [[third eye]]; [[trimurti]]; [[trikaya]]; the directionality of left, middle, right and forward, stationary, backwards; past, present, future; [[wiktionary:polarity|polarities]] and their synthesis; upperworld or ''[[akash]]'', middleworld or ''[[dharti]]'' and underworld or ''[[patal (cosmology)|patal]]'', etc.&lt;/ref&gt; on both the horizontal and vertical axes, though there are notable exceptions. This compositional arrangement highlights the numerological importance and spiritual energy of the integers three (3) and nine (9). Kīla may be constituted and constructed of different materials and material components, such as wood, metal, clay, bone, gems, horn or crystal.

Like the majority of traditional Tibetan metal instruments, the kīla is often made from brass and iron (terrestrial and/or [[meteoric]] iron.  '[[Thokcha]]' ({{bo|t=ཐོག་ལྕགས|w=thog lcags}}) means "sky-iron" in Tibetan and denote tektites and meteorites which are often high in iron content. Meteoric iron was highly prized throughout the Himalaya where it was included in sophisticated polymetallic alloys such as [[Panchaloha]] for ritual implements. The [[Hilt#Pommel|pommel]] of the kīla often bears three faces of Vajrakīla, one joyful, one peaceful, one wrathful, but may bear the umbrella of the [[ashtamangala]] or [[mushroom]] cap, [[Iṣṭha-deva(tā) (Buddhism)|ishtadevata]] (like [[Hayagriva]]), [[Snow Lion|snow lion]], or [[stupa]], among other possibilities. The handle is often of a [[vajra]], weaving or knotwork design. The handle generally has a triune form as is common to the pommel and blade. The blade is usually composed of three triangular facets or faces, meeting at the tip. These represent, respectively, the blade's power to transform the negative energies known as the "three poisons" or "root poisons" (Sanskrit: ''mula [[Kleshas (Buddhism)|klesha]]'') of attachment/craving/desire, delusion/ignorance/misconception, and aversion/fear/hate.

==Ritual usage==
Cantwell and Mayer (2008) have studied a number of texts recovered from the cache of the [[Dunhuang manuscripts]] that discuss the phurba and its ritual usage.&lt;ref&gt;Cantwell, Cathy &amp; Mayer, Robert (2008) ''Early Tibetan Documents on Phur pa from Dunhuang''. Wien: Verlag der Österreichischen Akademie der Wissenschaften {{ISBN|3-7001-6100-X}} (Accompanying disc entitled "Images of Dunhunag manuscripts from the Stein Collection in London" contains 60 JPEG-images)&lt;/ref&gt;

The kīla is one of many iconographic representations of divine "symbolic attributes" (Tibetan: ''phyag mtshan'')&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://rywiki.tsadra.org/index.php/phyag_mtshan|title=phyag mtshan|last=|first=|date=2005|website=Rangjung Yeshe Wiki - Dharma Dictionnary|language=en|access-date=2017-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;of [[Vajrayana]]&lt;ref&gt;Embodied [[Nirmanakaya]] buddhas and [[sambhogakaya]] deities are attributed with kīla.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Hindu]] deities. When consecrated and bound for usage,&lt;ref&gt;A working kīla has the face(s), [[Hilt#Pommel|pommel]] and [[hilt]] bound (depending on the nature of the kīla) with fabric [often green according to [[Claudia Müller-Ebeling|Müller-Ebelling]], ''et al.'' (2002)] and in this binding rite Vajrakilaya is installed in the tool as a [[Nirmanakaya]] manifestation, by association the tool accesses all three realms of the [[Trikaya]].&lt;/ref&gt; the kīla are a [[nirmanakaya]] manifestation of Vajrakīlaya.

Chandra, ''et al.'' (1902: p.&amp;nbsp;37) in their Dictionary entry 'korkor' ({{bo|t=ཀོར་ཀོར|w=kor kor}}) "coiled" (English) relates that the text titled the 'Vaidūry Ngonpo'  ({{bo|t=བཻ་ཌཱུརྻ་སྔོན་པོ|w=bai dUry sngon po}}) has the passage: ཐག་བ་ཕུར་བ་ལ་ཀོར་ཀོར་བྱམ "a string was wound round the (exorcist's) dagger [phurba]."&lt;ref&gt;Das, Sarat Chandra (1902) ''Tibetan-English Dictionary with Sanskrit Synonyms''. Calcutta: Bengal Secretariat Book Depot, p. 37&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the principal methods of working with the kīla and to actualize its essence-quality is to pierce the earth with it; [[Scabbard|sheath]] it; or as is common with Himalayan [[shaman]]ic traditions, to penetrate it vertically, point down into a basket, bowl or cache of rice (or other soft grain if the kīla is wooden).&lt;ref&gt;Herein resides the rationale why the centrality of the kīla has often been overlooked by the observer and the scholar, as the kīla may not be a tool ostensibly engaged in a particular rite but is actualized on the principal [[altar]] away from all the 'action'.&lt;/ref&gt; The terms employed for the deity and the tool are interchangeable in Western scholarship. In the [[Himalaya]]n shamanic tradition the kīla may be considered as [[axis mundi]]. Müller-Ebelling, ''et al.'' (2002) affirm that for the majority of Nepalese shaman, the kīla is [[cognate]] with the ''[[world tree]]'', either in their visualisations or in initiatory rites or other rituals.

The kīla is used as a ritual implement to signify stability on a prayer ground during ceremonies, and only those initiated in its use, or otherwise empowered, may wield it. The energy of the kīla is fierce, wrathful, piercing, affixing, transfixing. The kīla affixes the elemental process of 'Space' (Sanskrit: [[Akasha|Ākāśa]]) to the Earth, thereby establishing an energetic continuum. The kīla, particularly those that are wooden are for [[shamanic]] healing, harmonizing and energy work and often have two [[nāga]]s&lt;ref&gt;These naga are often considered to be [[Nagaraja]] and [[Nagarani]]: the divine Nāga couple who rule the underworld or underwater world.&lt;/ref&gt; ([[Sanskrit]] for [[snake]], [[serpent (symbolism)|serpent]] and/or [[dragon]], also refers to a class of supernatural entities or [[deities]]) entwined on the blade, reminiscent of the [[Staff of Asclepius]] and the [[Caduceus]] of [[Hermes]]. Kīla often also bear the [[ashtamangala]], [[swastika]], [[sauwastika]] and/or other [[Himalayas|Himalayan]], [[tantra|Tantric]] or Hindu iconography or motifs.

As a tool of exorcism, the kīla may be employed to hold demons or [[thoughtform]]s in place (once they have been expelled from their human hosts, for example) in order that their mindstream may be re-directed and their inherent obscurations transmuted. More esoterically, the kīla may serve to bind and pin down negative energies or obscurations from the mindstream of an entity, person or thoughtform, including the thoughtform generated by a group, project and so on, to administer purification.

The kīla as an iconographical implement is also directly related to Vajrakilaya, a [[wrathful deity]] of Tibetan Buddhism who is often seen with his consort [[Diptacakra]] (Tib. 'khor lo rgyas 'debs ma). He is embodied in the kīla as a means of destroying (in the sense of finalising and then freeing) violence, hatred, and aggression by tying them to the blade of the kīla and then transmuting them with its tip.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}} The pommel may be employed in [[blessing]]s. It is therefore that the kīla is not a physical weapon, but a spiritual implement, and should be regarded as such. The kīla often bears the epithet Diamantine Dagger of Emptiness (see [[shunyata]]).{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}

As [[Claudia Müller-Ebeling|Müller-Ebeling]], ''et al.'' (2002:  p.&amp;nbsp;55) states:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The magic of the Magical Dagger comes from the effect that the material object has on the realm of the spirit. The art of tantric magicians or lamas lies in their visionary ability to comprehend the spiritual energy of the material object and to willfully focus it in a determined direction. . . The tantric use of the phurba encompasses the curing of disease, exorcism, killing demons, meditation, consecrations (puja), and weather-making. The blade of the phurba is used for the destruction of demonic powers. The top end of the phurba is used by the tantrikas for blessings.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

As Beer (1999:  p.&amp;nbsp;277-278) states, transfixing kīla , [[charnel ground]], [[scorpion]] and [[Padmasambhava]]:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The sting of the scorpion's whip-like tail transfixes and poisons its prey, and in this respect it is identified with the wrathful activity of the ritual dagger or kīla. Padmasambhava's biography relates how he received the siddhi of the kīla transmission at the great charnel ground of Rajgriha from a gigantic scorpion with nine heads, eighteen pincers and twenty-seven eyes. This scorpion reveals the kīla texts from a triangular stone box hidden beneath a rock in the cemetery. As Padmasambhava reads this terma text spontaneous understanding arises, and the heads, pincers, and eyes of the scorpion are 'revealed' as different vehicles or ''yanas'' of spiritual attainment. Here, at Rajgriha, Padmasambhava is given the title of 'the scorpion guru', and in one of his eight forms as Guru Dragpo or Pema Drago ('wrathful lotus'), he is depicted with a scorpion in his left hand. As an emblem of the wrathful kīla transmission the image of the scorpion took on a strong symbolic meaning in the early development of the Nyingma or 'ancient school' of Tibetan Buddhism...".
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Cultural context===
To work with the spirits and deities of the earth, land and place, people of India, the Himalayas and the [[Mongolian-Manchurian grassland|Mongolian Steppe]] pegged, nailed and/or pinned down the land. The nailing of the kīla is comparable to the idea of breaking the earth (turning the [[sod]]) in other traditions and the rite of laying the [[foundation stone]]. It is an ancient shamanic idea that has common currency throughout the region; it is prevalent in the Bön tradition and is also evident in the [[Vajrayana]] tradition. According to [[shaman]]ic [[folklore]] current throughout the region, "...the mountains were giant pegs that kept the Earth in place and prevented it from moving." (Kerrigan, ''et al.'', 1998:  p27) Mountains such as [[Amnye Machen]], according to folklore were held to have been brought from other lands just for this purpose. [[Stupa]] (compare [[cairn]]) are a development of this tradition and akin to kīla.

(Kerrigan, ''et al.'', 1998:  p27) states that:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"Prayer flags and stone pillars throughout the country also pierce the land. Even the pegs of the nomads’ yak wool tents are thought of as sanctifying the ground that lies beneath...".&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Traditions such as that of the kīla may be considered{{Who|date=May 2011}} a human [[cultural universal]] in light of [[foundation stone]] rites and other comparable rites documented in the disciplines of [[anthropology]] and [[ethnography]]; e.g., turning of the soil as a placation and [[votive]] offering to spirits of place and to preparation of the land as a rite to ensure fertility and bountiful yield.

===Traditional lineage usage: anthology of case studies===
In the [[Kathmandu Valley]], the kīla is still in usage by [[shaman]]s, magicians, [[tantrika]]s and [[lama]]s of different ethnic backgrounds. The kīla is used particularly intensively by the [[Tamang]], [[Gurung]] and [[Newar people|Newari]] Tibeto-Burmese tribes. The kīla is also employed by the Tibetans native to Nepal (the [[Bhotiya|Bhotyas]]), the [[Sherpas]], and the Tibetans living in [[Dharamsala, Himachal Pradesh|Dharamasala]].

Müller-Ebelling, ''et al.'' (2002:  p.&amp;nbsp;29) chart the difference of the kīla traditions between the ''jhankris''&lt;ref&gt;Jhankris may be understood as individuals who have a '[[Religious calling|calling]]' to work with the kīla and are mostly of non-hereditary lineages of kīla workers.&lt;/ref&gt; and the ''gubajus'':&lt;ref&gt;Gubajus may be understood as the [[priest]]s, [[astrologer]]s and [[Traditional healer|healers]] amongst the [[Newar people|Newari]] people of the [[Kathmandu Valley]]. Their purba traditions are of hereditary lineages which may be considered [[caste]]s.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The phurbas of the gubajus are different from those of the jhankris. As a rule, they have only one head on which there is a double vajra as shown here. Gubajus focus on the head as a mirror image of themselves in order to meditatively connect with the power of the phurba. The three or more heads of the upper area of the phurba indicate the collection of energies that the jhankris use.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A "Bhairab kīla" is an important healing tool of the tantric [[Newar people|Newari]] gubajus. As Müller-Ebelling, ''et al.'' (2002:  p.&amp;nbsp;55) state:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Tantric priests ([[guruju]]) use [[Bhairab phurba]]s for the curing of disease and especially for curing children's diseases. For these cases the point of the phurba blade is dipped into a glass or a bowl of water, turned and stirred. The sick child is then given the magically charged water as medicine to drink.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Müller-Ebelling, ''et al.'' (2002:  p. ?) interviewed [[Mohan Rai]]. ([[Mohan Rai]] is a shaman from the border area of [[Nepal]] and [[Bhutan]] and belongs to the [[Mongolia]]n people of the [[Rai (ethnic group)|Rai]] and/or [[Kirati]]. Mohan Rai is the founder of the Shamanistic Studies and Research Centre, [[Baniya Goun]], [[Naikap]], [[Kathmandu]], Nepal)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.himalayanshamans.com/ (accessed: Monday, February 26, 2007)]&lt;/ref&gt; who in an interview is directly quoted as saying:
&lt;blockquote&gt;'Without the phurba inside himself, the shaman has no consciousness'...'The shaman himself is the phurba; he assumes its form in order to fly into other worlds and realities.'
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Therefore to extrapolate, the kīla is identified with [[consciousness]] and the root of sentience, the [[buddha-nature]].

Müller-Ebelling ''et al.'' (2002) affirm that some [[Kukri]] may be considered kīla, as ultimately, everything that approximates a vertical form. The kīla then is a [[phallic]] [[polysemy]] and cognate with [[lingam]] ~ the generative instrument of [[Shiva]] that is [[metonym]]ic of the primordial energy of the Universe. The kīla as lingam, actualizes the [[yoni]] essence-quality of whatever it penetrates.

The wrathful [[heruka]] '''Vajrakilaya''' is a meditation deity who embodies the energetic [[Three vajra#Five fundamental aspects of an enlightened being|'activity' (Wylie: phrin las)]] of all the buddhas, manifesting in a powerful and wrathful yet compassionate form in order to subjugate the delusion and negativity that can arise as obstacles to the practice of [[Dharma]].

==Vajrakīla (Vajrakīlaya)==
[[File:Beijing_2009-1007.jpg|thumb|Vajrakila. Lama Temple, Beijing]]

[[Dzongsar Khyentse Rinpoche]] on the practice of Vajrakilaya states that:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"Vajrakilaya, or kīla, means something sharp, and something that pierces – a dagger. A dagger that is so sharp it can pierce anything, while at the same time nothing can pierce it. That is the quality. This sharp and piercing energy is what is used to practice and out of the many infinite, endless Vajrayana methods this happens to be one of most important methods."
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===As deity===
[[File:Vajrakilaya (8557221604).jpg|thumb|Vajrakilaya]]
Vajrakilaya is a significant Vajrayana deity who transmutes and transcends obstacles and obscurations. Vajrakila is the divine '[[thoughtform]]' ({{bo|w=[http://rywiki.tsadra.org/index.php/sprul_pa sprul pa]|t=སྤྲུལ་པ།|lang=yes}}) that governs the kīla. [[Padmasambhava]] achieved realisation through practicing '[[Yangdag]] [[Heruka]]' (Tibetan: ''yang dag he ru ka'')&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://rywiki.tsadra.org/index.php/yang_dag_he_ru_ka|title=yang dag he ru ka|last=|first=|date=2005|website=Rangjung Yeshe Wiki - Dharma Dictionnary|language=en|access-date=2017-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; but only after combining it with the practice of '''Vajrakilaya''' to clean and clear obstacles and obscurations.

Vajrakilaya is also understood as the embodiment of activities of the [[Buddha mind]]. Sometimes Vajrakilaya is perceived as the wrathful vajrayana form of [[Vajrapani]], according to [[Dilgo Khyentse Rinpoche]]. Many great masters both in India and Tibet, but especially in Tibet, have practiced Vajrakilaya (especially in the [[Nyingma]] lineage, and among the [[Kagyu]] and also within the [[Sakyapa]]s). The Sakyapa's main deity, besides [[Hevajra]] is [[Vajrakumara]] or Vajrakilaya.

[[Jamyang Khyentse Wangpo]], [[Dilgo Khyentse Rinpoche]], [[Dudjom Rinpoche]] and a significant number of [[lama]]s within the [[Kagyu]] and [[Nyingma]] engaged Vajrakilaya [[sadhana]].

===Iconography===

Vajrakilaya (also known as ''Vajrakumara'') is the deity of the magic thundernail, the kīla, a tool of the sharp adamantine point of [[dharmakaya]], a wisdom forded through the power of one-pointed concentration. This 'one-pointed' (Sanskrit: ''eka graha'') focus is a concerted mindfulness on the unity and interdependence of all [[dharmas]]. This one-pointed focus is understood as 'applying oneself fully' (Tibetan: ''sgrim pa'').&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://rywiki.tsadra.org/index.php/sgrim_pa|title=sgrim pa|last=|first=|date=2005|website=Rangjung Yeshe Wiki - Dharma Dictionnary|language=en|access-date=2017-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; The three pointed blade represents delusion, attachment and aversion transformation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Karma Lingpa|first1=Terton|title=The Tibetan Book of the Dead|date=January 30, 2007|publisher=Penguin Classics|isbn=978-0143104940|edition=First Complete|p=523}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vajrakilaya is a favoured tantric archetypal deity embraced by the [[Nyingma]]pa. The awesome and wrathful manifestation of this empty yet apparent deity assists practitioners in clearing the obstructions to realisation.

A common manifestation of Vajrakilla has three heads, six arms, and four legs. Vajrakilaya's three right hands except for the right front one held [[vajra]]s with five and nine prongs. The right front one makes a [[mudra]] as granting [[Blessing|boons]] with open palm. Vajrakilaya's three left hands hold a flaming triple wishfulfilling jewel or [[triratna]], a [[trident]] and the [[kilaya]]. Vajrakilaya's back is covered by the freshly flayed skin of the [[elephant]] representing 'ignorance' (Sanskrit: avidya; Wylie: marigpa), with the legs tied in front. A human skin is tied diagonally across his chest with the hands lying flat on Vajrakilaya's stomach and solar plexus representing the flailed ego that has released its powerful grip obscuring the 'qualities' of the Sadhaka.&lt;ref&gt;[[Three vajra]]: Body (Head), Voice (Throat), Mind (Heart), Qualities (solar plexus), Activities (secret place).&lt;/ref&gt; Qualities are represented iconographically by the 'vortex' (Sanrkit: chakra; Wylie: Khorlo) of the [[Manipura]] (Sanskrit: Maṇipūra). A rope ripples over his body with severed heads hanging by their hair representing the [[Akshamala]] or 'garland of [[Bīja|bija]]' (Sanskrit: Varnamala). A knee length loin cloth winds around his belly belted with a tiger skin complete with tail, claws and head. This deity wears manifold [[nāga]] adornments and jewellery: naga earrings, naga bracelets, naga anklets and a naga cord over his chest, sometimes referred to as a naga gurdle and a naga hairpiece or hair ornament. Vajrakilaya's faces are round and small compared to the tall body. Despite the large fangs and bulging eyes and his wrathful appearance, Vajrakilaya is perceived as having a benevolent demeanor.

===History of Vajrakilaya practice in India and Tibet===
Although at one point the Indic origin of kīla practice was widely questioned, Boord claims that "the existence of a Kīla cult among the Buddhists in eighth&lt;!-- corrected from "eight" per [[Wikipedia:Quotations]] "trivial spelling or typographical errors that obviously do not affect the intended meaning; these may be silently corrected" --&gt; century India...must now surely be accepted as established"&lt;ref&gt;Boord, Martin (1993) ''Cult of the Deity Vajrakila'' Institute of Buddhist Studies {{ISBN|0-9515424-3-5}}; p. 107&lt;/ref&gt; and further claims that it has been "conclusively demonstrated that all the basic doctrines and rituals of Vajrakīla had their origin in India."&lt;ref&gt;Boord, Martin (1993) ''Cult of the Deity Vajrakila'' Institute of Buddhist Studies {{ISBN|0-9515424-3-5}}; p. 223&lt;/ref&gt; Robert Mayer, one of the leading scholars of the kīla literature, shares the same view, writing that prior research had been plagued by "elementary misunderstandings"  based on a lack of familiarity with crucial Indic primary sources.&lt;ref name="Scriptureof"&gt;''A Scripture of the Ancient Tantra Collection: The Phur-pa bcu-gnyis'' by Robert Mayer Kindsdale Publications, 1996. {{ISBN|1-870838-52-1}} pg 103&lt;/ref&gt; Mayer says of Boord's work, "our understandings of the deity are quite similar" insofar as both do not doubt that "the phur-pa and the deity are Indic."&lt;ref name="Scriptureof" /&gt; 

Tibetan tradition, which Boord credits as generally credible, holds that the entire corpus of Indian kīla lore was systematized by
[[Padmasambhava]], [[Vimalamitra]], and the Nepali [[Śīlamañju]], while on retreat together at ''Yang-le-shod'' (present-day Pharping, Nepal). According to Boord, "it was precisely during this retreat that the many strands of kila lore were finally woven together into a coherent masterpiece of tantric Buddhism and thus it helps to illuminate the process by which tantric methods were being related to [[soteriology]] at this time. Beautifully codified in terms of both theory and practice, this divine scheme of meditation and magic was subsequently transmitted to Tibet and became established there as one of the major modes of religious engagement. So much so, in fact, that many previous writers on Tibet have actually assumed the kila cult to be of Tibetan origin."&lt;ref&gt;''A Bolt of Lightning From The Blue'' by Martin J. Boord. Edition Khordong, 2002. {{ISBN|3-936372-00-4}} pg xiii&lt;/ref&gt; Renowned Tibetologist and Buddhologist [[Herbert Guenther]] concurred in a review of Boord's work, concluding that his "careful research of all available texts relevant to the study of this figure" was "much needed and long overdue" in correcting longstanding "misrepresentation of historical facts."&lt;ref&gt;Review of the Cult of the Deity Vajrakila by Herbert Guenther. ''Journal of the American Oriental Society'' 117.3 (1997) pgs 620-621&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Robert Beer|Beer]] (1999: p.&amp;nbsp;246) conveys the entwined relationship of Vajrakilaya with [[Samye]], the propagation of [[Secret Mantra]] in Tibet, and the importance of the sadhana to both Padmasambhava's enlightenment, and his twenty-five 'heart disciples', who are of the [[mindstream]]s of the principal [[terton]] (according to Nyingma tradition):
&lt;blockquote&gt;
In the biography of Padmasambhava it is recorded that he travelled to the northern land of Kashakamala, where the cult of the kīla prevailed. Later, whilst meditating on the deity Yangdak Heruka (Skt. Vishuddha Heruka) in the 'Asura Cave' at Parping in the Kathmandu valley, he experienced many obstructions from the ''maras'', and in order to subjugate them he request the ''Kīla Vitotama Tantras'' to be brought from India. Having established the first Tibetan monastery at Samye, the first transmission that Padmasambhava gave to his 25 'heart disciples', in order to eliminate the hindrances to the propagation of the ''buddhadharma'' in Tibet, were the teachings of the ''Vajrakilaya Tantra''. From its early Nyingma origins the practice of Vajrakilaya as a ''yidam'' deity with the power to cut through any obstructions was absorbed into all schools of Tibetan Buddhism.&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert Beer|Beer, Robert]] (1999). ''The Encyclopedia of Tibetan Symbols and Motifs'' (Hardcover). Shambhala. {{ISBN|1-57062-416-X}}, {{ISBN|978-1-57062-416-2}}, p.246.

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

There are a number of [[Terma (religion)|terma]] teachings founded on Vajrakilaya. For instance, there are treasure teachings from [[Jigme Lingpa]], [[Ratna Lingpa]] and [[Nyang-rel Nyima Ozer]].

===Vajrakilaya Puja within the Sakyapa and others===

Vajrakilaya Puja has long unbroken lineage within the [[Sakya]]pa. Vajrakilaya Puja was received by [[Khön Nagendra Rakshita]] and his younger sibling [[Vajra Ratna]] from [[Padmasambhava]]. Since then it has been transmitted in the [[Khön]] lineage and has been enacted every year until the present. Even in the challenging times of 1959 the [[Sakya Trizin]] maintained the tradition.

The [[Rigpa]] Sangha of [[Sogyal Rinpoche]] practises several Vajrakilaya sadhanas.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rigpawiki.org/wiki/index.php?title=Vajrakilaya The Vajrakilaya Practices of the Rigpa Sangha] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090220113523/http://www.rigpawiki.org/wiki/index.php?title=Vajrakilaya |date=2009-02-20 }} Rigpa Shedra Wiki&lt;/ref&gt; The empowerment of Khön Tradition of Vajrakilaya has been given to the Rigpa sangha by H.H.

Contemporary [[Bon]] has "at least nine traditions of Phur pa," according to one scholar.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=des Jardins|first=Jean-Marc|date=April 2012|title=The records of Tshul khrims mchog rgyal on the Black Phur pa cycle of the Tibetan Bon pos|url=http://himalaya.socanth.cam.ac.uk/collections/journals/ret/pdf/ret_23_07.pdf|journal=Revue d’Etudes Tibétaines|volume=no. 23|pages=175|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Examples of practice in history===
* "Princess Sakyadevi was the daughter of King Sukkhadhara of Nepal. Her mother died in childbirth and she was displaced by the next queen and abandoned by the court. When she grew up she became a [[Yogini]] and resided near present day [[Parphing]], in the mountains just outside the [[Kathmandu Valley]]. There she is said to have become a [[Marriage|consort]] of Guru Padmasambhava and received teachings from him. The two lived together at the yogi's cave of Langlesho, above Parphing, where they mastered Vajrakilaya-practice. It is said that she eventually attained "Rainbow Body" as a realized female Buddha."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dharmafellowship.org/library/essays/women-buddhas.htm see section ''Princess Sakyadevi'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dharmafellowship.org/biographies/historicalsaints/lord-padmasambhava.htm see section ''6. Great Enlightenment'']&lt;/ref&gt;
* "During the empowerment of Assemblage of Sugatas,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rangjung.com/gl/Kabgye.htm#AssemblageofSugatas Assemblage of Sugatas] explanation&lt;/ref&gt; her [Yeshe Tsogyal's] initiation flower fell on the mandala of kīla. Through this practice she became able to tame evil spirits and revive the dead."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rangjung.com/authors/Yeshe_Tsogyal.htm Yeshe Tsogyal a brief biography] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081207005356/http://www.rangjung.com/authors/Yeshe_Tsogyal.htm |date=2008-12-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In popular culture===
*The 1986 film ''[[The Golden Child]]'' features a magical phurba called the Ajanti Dagger which has the ability to kill mystical beings, specifically the titular child and the demon Sardo Numspa.
*In the 1994 movie ''[[The Shadow (1994 film)|The Shadow]]'', the phurba was a dangerous weapon moving of its own accord.
*In the 2009 video game ''[[Uncharted 2: Among Thieves]]'', a golden phurba is the key to the mythical kingdom of [[Shambhala]].

'''LibreLogo''' is a [[Logo (programming language)|Logo]]-like, [[Python (programming language)|Python]] programming environment that uses interactive [[turtle graphics|turtle vector graphics]]. Its final output is a [[vector graphics]] rendition within the [[LibreOffice]] suite; and it can be used for education and desktop publishing.

==History==
Logo toolbar and interpreter was programmed by László Németh, and help with integration was provided by András Tímár.&lt;ref name="4-0-new-features"&gt;{{cite web|title=4.0 New Features and Fixes|url=https://www.libreoffice.org/download/4-0-new-features-and-fixes/|publisher=[[The Document Foundation]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It was released as an extension to [[LibreOffice]] before code was merged into LibreOffice  4.2.3.3 main code in 2014.&lt;ref name="extension-center"&gt;{{cite web|title=LibreLogo|url=http://extensions.libreoffice.org/extensions/librelogo}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The lightweight implementation (1400 lines in [[Python-PyUNO]]) uses the embedded [[Python (programming language)|Python]] to give a simplified programming interface to the vector graphics of LibreOffice for graphic design and education (including teaching of word processing).&lt;ref name="4-0-new-features" /&gt;

==Installation==
'''LibreLogo''' is embedded in every version of [[LibreOffice]] later than 4.2.3.3 (released in 2014). It can also be installed as an extension for earlier versions.&lt;ref name="LODownload"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.libreoffice.org/download/libreoffice-fresh/|title=LibreOffice downloads page|date=1 May 2014|accessdate=1 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It's a toolbar in &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;Writer&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; (&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;View&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; → &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;Toolbars&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; → &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;Logo&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;).&lt;ref name="quickstart"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://librelogo.org/quick-start/|title=Quick Start|last=Németh|first=László|date=30 April 2014|accessdate=1 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Use==
Touching the up-arrow on the Logo toolbar, activates the turtle, then the source code is typed directly onto the same page. The graphic is in [[SVG format]] and can be copy &amp; pasted into other documents.

The syntax of LibreLogo is similar to [[UCBLogo]]. It supports the '''¨word''' syntax for strings as well as the ''' 'word' ''' notation. Importantly LibreLogo supports [[recursion]]. Commands can entered into the toolbar, or compiled and run from the Writer page.

{{God}}
'''Love of God''' can mean either love for [[God]] or love by God. Love for God (''philotheia'') is associated with the concepts of [[worship]], and devotions towards God.&lt;ref&gt;[http://artfl.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/philologic/getobject.pl?c.78:6:121.lsj Liddell and Scott: φιλοθεΐα]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Greek language|Greek]] term ''theophilia'' means the love or favour of God,&lt;ref&gt;[http://artfl.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/philologic/getobject.pl?c.27:2:118.lsj Liddell and Scott: θεοφιλία]&lt;/ref&gt; and ''theophilos'' means friend of God, originally in the sense of being loved by God or loved by the gods;&lt;ref&gt;[http://artfl.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/philologic/getobject.pl?c.27:2:120.lsj Liddell and Scott: θεόφιλος (refers the reader to θεοφίλητος]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://artfl.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/philologic/getobject.pl?c.27:2:117.lsj Liddell and Scott: θεοφίλητος]&lt;/ref&gt; but is today sometimes understood in the sense of showing love for God.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.orgsites.com/wa/facab/names.doc Teofil] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101203170343/http://www.orgsites.com/wa/facab/names.doc |date=2010-12-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=oXY6wkc_ikgC&amp;pg=PT590&amp;vq=Theophilos&amp;source=gbs_search_r&amp;cad=0_2 The Baby Name Bible: The Ultimate Guide]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.babynamer.com/theophilos Theophilos] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110707203943/http://www.babynamer.com/theophilos |date=2011-07-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Greek term ''agape'' is applied both to the love that human beings have for God and to the love that God has for man.&lt;ref&gt;ἀγάπη, Liddell and Scott:  Greek-English Lexicon, Oxford:  Clarendon Press&lt;/ref&gt;

==Bahá'í Faith==
The teachings of the [[Bahá'í Faith]] hold that the love of God (''philanthropia'') is the primary reason for human creation, and one of the primary purposes of life.  The love of God purifies human hearts and through it humans become transformed and self-sacrificing, as they reflect more the attributes and qualities of God.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last= Smith |first= Peter |encyclopedia= A concise encyclopedia of the Bahá'í Faith |title= love |year= 2000 |publisher=Oneworld Publications |location= Oxford |isbn= 1-85168-184-1 |pages= 227–228}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Hatcher |first=W.S. |last2=Martin |first2=J.D. |year= 1989 |title=The Bahá'í Faith: The Emerging Global Religion |publisher=Harper &amp; Row |location=New York, New York |isbn= 0-06-065441-4 | ref = harv | pages = 100–101}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[`Abdu'l-Bahá]], the son of the founder of the religion wrote:
"There is nothing greater or more blessed than the ''Love of God''! It gives healing to the sick, balm to the wounded, joy and consolation to the whole world, and through it alone can man attain Life Everlasting. The essence of all religions is the Love of God, and it is the foundation of all the sacred teachings."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last = `Abdu'l-Bahá |year = 1912 |publication-date = 1995 |title = Paris Talks |publisher = Bahá'í Distribution Service |isbn = 1-870989-57-0 |url = http://reference.bahai.org/en/t/ab/PT/ | pages =82–83}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Christianity==
{{Main|Love of God in Christianity}}
{{see also|Love of Christ}}
The [[Old Testament]] uses a rich vocabulary to express the love of God, as a concept that appears in many instances.&lt;ref&gt;Theology of the Old Testament, Volume One by Walther Eichrodt 1961 {{ISBN|0-664-22308-7}} pages 250–251&lt;/ref&gt; The Lord expresses his love through the Old Testament prophet Jeremiah and says, "I have loved you with an everlasting love; I have drawn you with loving kindness" ([https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Jer31%3A3 Jeremiah 31:3]).&lt;ref name=WELS-OT-NT&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wels.net/cgi-bin/site.pl?1518&amp;cuTopic_topicID=40&amp;cuItem_itemID=1380 |archive-url=https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20080102075112/https://www.wels.net/cgi-bin/site.pl?1518&amp;cuTopic_topicID=40&amp;cuItem_itemID=1380 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2 January 2008 |work=WELS Topical Q&amp;A |title=God in Old Testament / God in New Testament |publisher=Wisconsin Evangelical Lutheran Synod |accessdate=29 Jan 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the [[exegesis]] of the love of God in the Old Testament has presented problems for modern scholars.&lt;ref name=Erhard &gt;''Theologies in the Old Testament'' by Erhard Gerstenberger 2007 {{ISBN|0-567-08812-X}} page 87&lt;/ref&gt; The love of God appears in a number of texts (e.g. Hosea 1–3, and then in Ezek 16 and Isa 62) but resolving the references to produce a consistent interpretation has been challenging and subject to debate.&lt;ref name=Erhard /&gt;

Both the terms love of God and [[love of Christ]] appear in the [[New Testament]]. In cases such as in Romans 8:35 and [[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/Romans#8:39|Romans 8:39]] their use is related in the experience of the believer, without asserting their equality.&lt;ref name=Moo &gt;''The Epistle to the Romans'' by Douglas J. Moo 1996 {{ISBN|0-8028-2317-3}} page 547&lt;/ref&gt; In [[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/John#14:31|John 14:31]] Jesus expresses his love for [[God the Father]].&lt;ref name=Lamar192/&gt; This verse includes the only direct statement by Jesus in the New Testament about Jesus' love for God the Father.&lt;ref name=Lamar192&gt;''Preaching the Gospel of John: proclaiming the living Word'' by Lamar Williamson 2004 {{ISBN|0-664-22533-0}} page 192&lt;/ref&gt;

==Greek polytheism==
In [[polytheism]], that which is loved by the gods (τὸ θεοφιλές) was identified as the [[virtue|virtuous]] or [[pietas|pious]]. [[Socrates]] famously asked whether this identification is a [[tautology (logic)|tautology]] (see ''[[Euthyphro dilemma]]'').

==="Philotheos" and "theophilos"===
In [[Greek language|Greek]], ''[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3D%23111163 philotheos]'' means "loving God, pious", as ''[[philosopher|philosophos]]'' means a lover of wisdom (''sophia''). {{bibleverse|2|Timothy|3:4}}, using the word ''philotheos'' in the plural form, speaks of certain people as φιλήδονοι μᾶλλον ἢ φιλόθεοι (lovers of pleasure rather than lovers of God). The word ''[[Theophilus (disambiguation)|Theophilos]]'' was and is used as a proper name, but does not appear as an adjective or common noun in Greek,&lt;ref&gt;The word does not appear in the great [[Liddell and Scott|Liddell-Scott-Jones Greek-English Lexicon]]&lt;/ref&gt; which uses instead the form ''[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3D%2348342 theophilês,]'' which means "dear to God" but also "loving God".

However, [[Eric Voegelin]] used ''theophilos'' to mean "lover of God": "In the ''[[Phaedrus (dialogue)|Phaedrus]]'', [[Plato]] has [[Socrates]] describe the characteristics of the true thinker. When Phaedrus asks what one should call such a man, Socrates, following [[Heraclitus]], replies that the term ''sophos'', one who knows, would be excessive: this attribute may be applied to God alone: but one might well call him ''[[philosopher|philosophos]]'', a lover of wisdom. Thus in the classic sense and reference of 'philosophy', actual knowledge is reserved to God; finite man can only be the lover of knowledge, not himself the one who possesses knowledge. In the meaning of the passage, the lover of the knowledge that belongs only to the knowing God, the ''philosophos'', becomes the ''theophilos'', the lover of God."&lt;ref&gt;Eric Voegelin, ''Science, Politics, and Gnosticism (ISI Books {{ISBN|1-932236-48-1}}), p. 41&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hinduism==
In [[Hinduism]], in contrast to kāma, which is selfish, or pleasurable love, prema – or prem – refers to elevated love. Karuna is compassion and mercy, which impels one to help reduce the suffering of others. Bhakti is a Sanskrit term, meaning "loving devotion to the supreme God". A person who practices bhakti is called a bhakta. Hindu writers, theologians, and philosophers have distinguished nine forms of bhakti, which can be found in the Bhagavata Purana and works by Tulsidas. The philosophical work Narada Bhakti Sutras, written by an unknown author (presumed to be Narada), distinguishes eleven forms of love.

On the mystic side of Hinduism, one of the forms of [[Yoga]] includes [[Ishvarapranidhana]], or self-surrender to God, and his worship.

===Bhakti movements===
{{main|Bhakti yoga}}
{{see also|Svayam Bhagavan|Krishnaism}}
Devotees of [[Krishna]] worship him in different emotional, transcendental raptures, known as ''[[rasa (theology)|rasas]]''. Two major systems of Krishna worship developed, each with its own philosophical system. These two systems are ''aishwaryamaya bhakti'' and ''madhuryamaya bhakti''. ''Aishwaryamaya bhakti'' is revealed in the abode of queens and kingdom of Krishna in [[Dvārakā|Dwaraka]]. ''Madhuryamaya Bhakti'' is revealed in the abode of ''[[Braja]]''. Thus Krishna is variously worshipped according to the development of devotee's taste in worshipping the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Sri Krishna, as father, friend, master, beloved and many different varieties which are all extraordinary. Krishna is famous as ''Makhanchor'', or butter thief. He loved to eat butter and is the beloved of his little village in [[Gokul]]. These are all transcendental descriptions. Thus they are revealed to the sincere devotees in proportion to the development in their love of Godhead. [[Vaishnavism]] is a form of [[monotheism]], sometimes described as '[[polymorphic monotheism]]', with implication that there are many forms of one original deity, defined as belief in a single unitary deity who takes many forms. In Krishnaism this deity is Krishna, sometimes referred as intimate deity – as compared with the numerous four-armed forms of [[Narayana]] or [[Vishnu]].&lt;ref&gt;Scheweig, (2004) pp. 13–17&lt;/ref&gt; It may refer to either of the interrelated concepts of the love of God towards creation, the love of creatures towards God or relationship between the two as in [[bhakti]].

==Islam==
The love of God, and the [[Fear of God (religion)|fear of God]], are two of the foundations of [[Islam]]. The highest spiritual attainment in Islam is related to the love of God. "Yet there are men who take (for worship) others besides God, as equal (with God): They love them as they should love God. But those of Faith are overflowing in their love for God." (Quran 2:165)Another Islamic concept is that Gods love leads towards good deeds "And feed with food the needy, the orphan and the prisoner, for love of Him (ie. God)."

Islam, as Christianity, has numerous [[mysticism|mystics]] and traditions about the love of God, as in:

:"O lovers! The religion of the love of God is not found in Islam alone.
:In the realm of love, there is neither belief, nor unbelief." ([[Rumi]])&lt;ref&gt;Rumi's Quatrain no. 768, translated by Gamard &amp; Farhadi. Versions of this quatrain have been made by Shahram Shiva, "Hush: Don't Tell God", p. 17 and by Azima Kolin (based on Mafi), "Rumi: Whispers of the Beloved", p. 71. [`âshiq to yaqîn dân, ke musulmân na-bûd dar maZhab-é `ishq, kufr-o îmân na-bûd]&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of Divine Love, known as ''Ishq-e-Haqeeqi'' ([[Persian_language|Persian]]), is elaborated by many great Muslim saints to date. Some Sufi writers and poets may have taken human love as a metaphor to define Divine Love but the prominent mystics explain the concept in its entirety and reveal its hardcore reality. [[Rabia Basri]], the famous 7th century mystic, is known as the first female to have set the doctrine of Divine Love. In Islamic [[Sufism]], Ishq means to love God selflessly and unconditionally. For [[Rumi]], 'Sufism' itself is Ishq and not the path of [[asceticism]] (zuhd).&lt;ref name="Sufism is Ishq."&gt;{{cite book|author=Seyed Ghahreman Safavi, Simon Weightman|title=Rumi's Mystical Design: Reading the Mathnawi Book One|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tEPXmDAqW_sC&amp;pg=PA75&amp;dq=ishq+e+haqeeqi&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=ishq%20e%20haqeeqi&amp;f=false|publisher=SUNY Press|isbn= 978-1-438-42796-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Sultan Bahoo]], Ishq means to serve God by devoting one's entire life to Him and asking no reward in return.&lt;ref name="True love goes unrewarded"&gt;{{cite book|author=Sult̤ān Mohammad Najib-ur-Rehman|title=Sultan Bahoo: The Life and Teachings |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hlyMAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA94&amp;dq=true+love+goes+unrewarded&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=true%20love%20goes%20unrewarded&amp;f=false|publisher=Sultan-ul-Faqr Publications|isbn= 978-9-699-79518-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Judaism==
{{main|Jewish views on love#Love between God and human beings}}
The love of God has been called the "essence of [[Judaism]]". "And you shall love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your might." ({{bibleref2|Deut|6:5}})

==Other==
[[Goethe]] expresses the sentiment of love of God alongside the opposite sentiment of [[hatred of God]] in his two poems [[Ganymed (Goethe)|Ganymed]] and [[Prometheus (Goethe)|Prometheus]],  respectively.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12653">'''Mangrove restoration''' is the regeneration of [[mangrove forest]] ecosystems in areas where they have previously existed. The practice of mangrove restoration is grounded in the discipline of [[restoration ecology]], which aims to “[assist] the recovery of [[ecological resilience|resilience]] and [[adaptive capacity]] of ecosystems that have been degraded, damaged, or destroyed”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=FSM 2000 – National Forest Resource Management, Chapter 2020 – Ecological Restoration and Resilience|url=http://www.fs.fed.us/restoration/|accessdate=9 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since [[environmental impact]]s are an ongoing threat, to successfully restore an ecosystem implies not merely to recreate its former condition, but to strengthen its capacity to adapt to change over time.

==Environmental context==
Mangrove forests, along with the animal species they shelter, represent globally significant sources of [[biodiversity]] and provide humanity with valuable [[ecosystem services]]. They are used by [[mammal]]s, [[reptile]]s and [[migratory bird]]s as feeding and breeding grounds, and provide crucial habitats for [[fish]] and [[crustacean]] species of commercial importance. The roots of the mangrove physically buffer shorelines from the erosive impacts of ocean waves and storms. Additionally, they protect [[riparian zone]]s by absorbing floodwaters and slowing down the flow of [[sediment]]-loaded river water. This allows sediments to drop to the bottom where they are held in place, thus containing potentially [[toxic waste]] products and improving the [[water quality|quality of water]] and sanitation in coastal communities.

To the human communities who rely on them, mangrove forests represent local sources of sustainable income from the harvest of fish and [[timber]], as well as non-timber forest products such as [[medicinal plant]]s, palm leaves and [[honey]]. On a global scale, they have been shown to sequester carbon in quantities comparable to higher-[[canopy (biology)|canopy]] terrestrial [[rainforest]]s, which means that they may play a role in [[climate change mitigation]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Spalding|first=Mark|title=World Atlas of Mangroves|year=2010|publisher=Earthscan|location=London, UK: Washington, DC |author2=Kainuma, Mami |author3=Collins, Lorna}}&lt;/ref&gt; in addition to physically protecting coastlines from the projected [[Sea level rise|sea-level rise]] associated with climate change.&lt;ref name="World Resources Institute"&gt;{{cite web|title=Millennium Ecosystem Assessment. Ecosystems and Human Well-Being: Wetlands and Water Synthesis.|url=http://www.maweb.org/documents/document.358.aspx.pdf|publisher=World Resources Institute|accessdate=10 July 2012|location=Washington, DC|year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, there are limits to the capacity of mangroves to adapt to climate change. It is projected that a 1-meter rise in sea level could inundate and destroy mangrove forests in many regions around the globe,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Working Group II: Impacts, Adaptation and Vulnerability. 19.3.3.5, "Mangrove Ecosystems"|url=http://www.ipcc.ch/ipccreports/tar/wg2/index.php?idp=0|work=IPCC Fourth Assessment Report: Climate Change 2001|accessdate=24 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; which would leave coastal communities vulnerable to the risks of [[flooding]], [[shoreline erosion]], [[saline intrusion]] and increased storm activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Field|first=C.D.|title=Impact of expected climate change on mangroves|journal=Hydrobiologia|year=1995|volume=295|issue=1-3|pages=75–81|doi=10.1007/BF00029113}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mangrove loss and degradation===
The issue of restoration is critical today since mangrove forests are [[deforestation|being lost]] very quickly – at an even faster rate than tropical rainforests inland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Duke|first=N.C. |author2=Meynecke, J.-O. |author3=Dittmann, S. |author4=Ellison, A.M. |author5=Anger, K. |author6=Berger, U. |author7=Cannicci, S. |author8=Diele, K. |author9=Ewel, K.C. |author10=Field, C.D. |author11=Koedam, N. |author12=Lee, S.Y. |author13=Marchand, C. |author14=Nordhaus, I. |author15=Dahdouh-Guebas, F. |title=A world without mangroves?|journal=Science|year=2007|volume=317|issue=5834|pages=41–42|doi=10.1126/science.317.5834.41b}}&lt;/ref&gt; A recent estimate puts the total mangrove area worldwide in 2005 at 152,000&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; – down from 188,000&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; in 1980.&lt;ref name="Food and Agriculture Organization"&gt;{{cite book|title=The world's mangroves 1980-2005|year=2007|publisher=Food and Agriculture Organization|isbn=9789251058565}}&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, some 36,000&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, or nearly 20% of the world's mangroves, were lost over a period of twenty-five years. Other estimates of loss may differ due to having been drawn from a smaller pool of data. The [[Millennium Ecosystem Assessment]] estimates the total loss worldwide at 35% between 1980 and 2000, but this result was drawn from data on only slightly more than half of the total mangrove area.&lt;ref name="World Resources Institute" /&gt; Much of this lost mangrove area was destroyed to make room for industry, [[housing]] and [[tourism]] development; for [[aquaculture]], primarily shrimp farms; and for [[agriculture]], such as [[rice paddies]], [[livestock]] [[pasture]] and [[salt production]].&lt;ref name="Food and Agriculture Organization" /&gt; Other drivers of mangrove forest destruction include activities that divert their sources of freshwater, such as groundwater withdrawals, the building of dams, and the building of roads and [[drainage]] canals across [[tidal flat]]s.

===Mangrove restoration===
Mangroves are [[Resistance (ecology)|sensitive ecosystems]], changing dynamically in response to storms, sediment blockage, and fluctuations in sea level &lt;ref name="Field"/&gt; and present a “moving target” for restoration efforts. Different restoration approaches face this challenge in different ways. The most common method simply consists in planting single-species stands of mangroves in areas thought to be suitable, without consideration of whether or not they supported mangroves in the past.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ecological Mangrove Restoration in Thailand|url=http://www.wetlands.org/Whatwedo/Ouractions/tabid/2661/mod/601/articleType/ArticleView/articleId/2018/Ecological-Mangrove-Restoration-in-Thailand.aspx|publisher=Wetlands International|year=2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121010203029/http://www.wetlands.org/Whatwedo/Ouractions/tabid/2661/mod/601/articleType/ArticleView/articleId/2018/Ecological-Mangrove-Restoration-in-Thailand.aspx|archivedate=2012-10-10|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This approach usually fails over the long term because the underlying soil and [[hydrological]] requirements of the mangroves are not being met. More informed methods aim to bring a damaged mangrove area back into its preexisting condition, taking into account not only ecosystem factors but also social, cultural and political perspectives.&lt;ref name="Field"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Field|first=C.D.|title=Rehabilitation of Mangrove Ecosystems: An Overview|journal=Marine Pollution Bulletin|year=1998|volume=37|issue=8-12|pages=383–392|doi=10.1016/s0025-326x(99)00106-x}}&lt;/ref&gt; These approaches begin with the understanding that a damaged mangrove area may be able to repair itself through the natural processes of [[secondary succession]], without being physically planted, provided that its tidal and freshwater hydrology is functioning normally and there is an adequate supply of [[seedling]]s.&lt;ref name="lewis"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lewis|first=Roy R.|title=Ecological engineering for successful management and restoration of mangrove forests|journal=Ecological Engineering|year=2005|volume=24|pages=403–418|doi=10.1016/j.ecoleng.2004.10.003}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Taking this into account, it becomes crucial to the success of a restoration project to evaluate what the hydrology of a disturbed mangrove site should look like under normal conditions, and the ways in which it has been modified.
One example of this approach is the Ecological Mangrove Restoration method &lt;ref name="lewis" /&gt; which recommends the following steps, to be undertaken using healthy mangroves of the surrounding area as a reference: 
# Assess the ecology, especially reproduction and distribution patterns, of the mangrove species at the disturbed site; 
# Map the topographical elevations and hydrological patterns that determine how seedlings should establish themselves at the site; 
# Assess the changes made to the site that currently prevent the site from recovering by itself; 
# Design a restoration plan that begins by restoring the normal range of elevations and tidal hydrology at the site; and 
# Monitor the site to determine if the restoration has been successful in light of the original objectives. 
The actual planting of seedlings is a last resort, since it fails in many cases;&lt;ref name="lewis" /&gt; it should be considered only if natural recruitment of seedlings fails to reach the restoration objective.

==Additional considerations==
An important but often overlooked aspect of mangrove restoration efforts is the role that the local communities play as [[Stakeholder (corporate)|stakeholders]] in the process and the outcome. Since they may directly feel the effects of restoration projects, they should be involved in the process as much as feasibly possible, from decision-making to maintenance over the long term. Their involvement and [[local knowledge]], as well as collaboration with other stakeholders such as sponsors and governing agencies, is crucial to the success of restoration projects.

===Limitations===
In some areas, restoration may be prohibitively difficult due to the [[soil degradation|degradation of the soil]] that regularly follows the [[clear-cutting]] of mangrove forests. Common effects include advanced [[soil erosion|erosion]] of the soil, loss of nutrients, high levels of [[salinity]], and/or buildup of toxins.&lt;ref name="Field" /&gt; However, even without this extent of degradation, the soil may become unable to host plant life at all due to the loss of the live mangrove roots, which exuded oxygen and carbohydrate into the soil and maintained its [[soil quality|quality]]. Using foresight early in the restoration process to carefully select sites that are likely to succeed as self-maintaining ecosystems, as well as ensuring that proper management is built into the conservation effort, can prevent the waste of time and energy that often accompanies restoration projects. The long-lasting aftereffects of mangrove degradation underscore the importance of eliminating its causes, since once sites are cleared, it is difficult for them to recover without a scientific intervention.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5226">'''Michael Richard Ayers''', {{post-nominals|country=GBR|commas=on|FBA|size=100%}} (born 1935) is a British philosopher and [[professor emeritus]] of [[philosophy]] at the [[University of Oxford]]. He studied at [[St John's College, Cambridge|St. John's College]] of the [[University of Cambridge]], and was a member of [[Wadham College]], Oxford from 1965 until 2002. Among his students are [[Colin McGinn]] and William Child.

==Career==
Michael Ayers's research focuses are in the history of philosophy and in epistemology, metaphysics and language. He is co-editor of the ''Cambridge History of Seventeenth-Century Philosophy'' and subject editor of the ''Routledge Encyclopedia of Philosophy'', has edited the work of George Berkeley and published on Descartes. His most influential contributions, however, concern the work of [[John Locke]]. He is the author of ''Locke: Epistemology and Ontology'' as well as of several seminal articles on Locke's philosophy.

In 1987 [[Bryan Magee]] invited Michael Ayers to talk about Locke and Berkeley in the BBC's series ''The Great Philosophers''.

More recently, Michael Ayers has published on metaphysics.

'''Morris Weitz''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|w|iː|t|s}}; July 24, 1916 – February 1, 1981)  "was an American philosopher of aesthetics who focused primarily on ontology, interpretation, and literary criticism".&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://ecommons.udayton.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?referer=https://www.google.co.uk/&amp;httpsredir=1&amp;article=1005&amp;context=phl_fac_pub|title=Morris Weitz|last=Bresnahan|first=Aili W.|date=2014|website=(University of Dayton) History of Philosophy Commons|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=1 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1972 until his death he was Richard Koret Professor of Philosophy at [[Brandeis University|Brandels University]].

== Biography ==

=== Personal life ===
Morris Weitz was born on July 24, 1916 in Detroit, his parents having emigrated from Europe (and his father having worked as a painting contractor).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; He was husband to [[Margaret Weitz|Margaret (née) Collins]] ("an author and renowned scholar of French women, French culture and the French Resistance"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www2.suffolk.edu/files/Archives/MS109_findingaid.pdf|title=Margaret Collins Weitz Papers (MS109): A Finding Aid|last=Moakley Archive and Institute|first=|date=|website=Suffolk University  [Boston MA]|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=1 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;) and the father of three children, [[Richard Weitz|Richard]], David, and Catherine (the former being a director of the Center for Political-Military Analysis and a Senior Fellow at the Hudson Institute). Morris Weitz died on February the 1st of 1981, in hospital in [[Roxbury, Boston|Roxbury]] after a long illness aged 64 having lived latterly in [[Newton, Massachusetts|Newton]], Massachusetts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1981/02/04/obituaries/dr-morris-weitz-64-a-professor-who-wrote-books-on-philosophy.html|title=Dr. Morris Weitz, 64, a Professor Who Wrote Books on Philosophy|date=1981-02-04|work=The New York Times|access-date=2018-02-01|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Tertiary Education and Academic Career ===
Weitz obtained his BA in 1938 from [[Wayne State University]]. While doing graduate work in French history at the [[University of Chicago]] he met [[Bertrand Russell]], which directed Weitz's interests towards philosophy. He received his Masters and, in 1943, his Phd in philosophy from the [[University of Michigan]] with a dissertation titled ''[https://books.google.co.uk/books/about/THE_METHOD_OF_ANALYSIS_IN_THE_PHILOSOPHY.html?id=UO_jrQEACAAJ&amp;redir_esc=y The Method of Analysis in the Philosophy of Bertrand Russell]''.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=Ijpj1tB3Qr0C&amp;pg=PA2550&amp;lpg=PA2550&amp;dq=Morris+Weitz+was+born+on+28+July+1916+in+Detroit,+Michigan.&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=8DbQ9PovGw&amp;sig=6oWfLCCZp_sGbOywJbbqzBIEC3k&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjeyPzRiIXZAhWJK8AKHfUhDIoQ6AEILjAB#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=WEITZ, Morris (1916–81)|last=Meskin|first=Aaron|work=The Dictionary Of Modern American Philosophers|publisher=Thoemmes Continuum|year=2005|isbn=1843710374|editor-last=Shook|editor-first=John R.|location=Bristol|pages=2550–2554|oclc=276357640}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the course of his career he taught philosophy at the [[University of Washington]] (1944–5), [[Vassar College]] (1945–8), and [[Ohio State University]] (1954–69).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In 1969 Weitz moved to [[Brandeis University]] where, in 1972, he was named Richard Koret Professor of Philosophy in 1972, a position he retained until his death. He was also a visiting professor at [[Columbia University|Columbia]], [[Cornell University|Cornell]], and [[Harvard University|Harvard]]. He was recognised with a [[Guggenheim Fellowship]] in 1959,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.gf.org/fellows/all-fellows/morris-weitz/|title=MORRIS WEITZ|last=|first=|date=|website=John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=1 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was also honored as a [[Fulbright Senior Scholar]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Philosophical Thought, Influence, and Criticisms ==
Weitz spent a year in [[University of Oxford|Oxford]] which led to lifelong friendships with Oxford philosophers such as [[Gilbert Ryle]], [[H. L. A. Hart|H.L.A. Hart]], and [[Isaiah Berlin]] and, in 1953, the publication in ''[[The Philosophical Review]]'' of ''[https://www.jstor.org/stable/2182793 Oxford Philosophy]'' (1953). In the same, according to [https://aaron-meskin.org/ Aaron W. Meskin] writing in ''[[Dictionary of Modern American Philosophers|The Dictionary of Modern American Philosophers]],"''Weitz argued that postwar Oxford philosophy was not unified by any general meta-philosophical position but rather by a commitment to investigating the logic of concepts". Meskin notes that this "was a significant publication in the United States as it served for many as an introduction to postwar Oxford philosophy".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Meskin suggests the work also "illuminates the course of Weitz’s career" - the "task of elucidating both ordinary and technical concepts" becoming central to his philosophical pursuits and his philosophical method becoming  "one of conceptual analysis, so long as this pursuit is not understood to be predicated on the goal of providing necessary and sufficient conditions".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Weitz is perhaps best known for his "influential and frequently anthologized"&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mandelbaum|first=Maurice|date=1965|title=Family Resemblances and Generalization concerning the Arts|jstor=20009169|journal=American Philosophical Quarterly|volume=2|issue=3|pages=219–228}}&lt;/ref&gt; 1956 paper [http://louisdoulas.info/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/The-Role-of-Theory-in-Aesthetics.pdf ''The Role of Theory in Aesthetics''] which was to win him a 1955 Matchette Prize&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; (an award now replaced by the [[American Philosophical Association]] book and article prizes&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.apaonline.org/page/article|title=Article Prize - The American Philosophical Association|website=www.apaonline.org|language=en|access-date=2018-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;). This essay explicitly modified the theory of art initially provided in his 1950 book ''Philosophy of the Arts''&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; which had been "[s]ubject to devastating criticisms from [[Margaret MacDonald (philosopher)|Margaret McDonald]] among others".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  In ''The Role of Theory in Aesthetics'' Weitz "overturned his original claim.. that his empirical and organic theory could produce a closed or real definition of art" according to [http://www.artistsmatter.com/ Aili Bresnahan] and it is "this revised version that many philosophers have considered the ''sine qua non'' in support of the position that theories of art should be 'open'".&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Supporters of Weitz's later view "for similar but non-identical reasons" include [[W. B. Gallie|W.B. Gallie]], W. E. Kennick and Benjamin R. Tilghman and detractors include [[M. H. Abrams|M.H. Abrams]], M.W. Beal, Lee Brown, [[George Dickie (philosopher)|George Dickie]], and [[Maurice Mandelbaum]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Mandelbaum in his 1965 paper ''[https://www.jstor.org/stable/20009169 Family Resemblances and Generalizations Concerning the Arts]''  refers to Weitz's paper and includes its author amongst those who, in support of the contention "that it is a mistake to attempt to discuss what art, or beauty, or the aesthetic, or a poem, essentially is... have made "explicit use of [[Ludwig Wittgenstein|Wittgenstein]]'s doctrine of [[family resemblance]]s". Mandelbaum claims that though he has "placed this at the forefront of his discussion.. Professor Weitz [has] made no attempt to analyze, clarify, or defend the doctrine itself".&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Weitz's 1956 paper has been, as Meskin notes, "one of the most influential works in contemporary philosophy of art, and.. continues to generate debate and discussion".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2604">'''New hermeneutic''' is the theory and methodology of interpretation ([[hermeneutics]]) to understand biblical texts through [[existentialism]]. The essence of new hermeneutic emphasizes not only the existence of language but also the fact that language is eventualized in the history of individual life.&lt;ref&gt;(1999) Dictionary of Biblical Interpretation, R.N. Soulen, "Ernst Fuchs", by John Hayes, 422-423&lt;/ref&gt; This is called the event of language. [[Ernst Fuchs (theologian)|Ernst Fuchs]],&lt;ref&gt;Ernst Fuchs, Briefe an&amp;nbsp;Gerhard Ebeling, in: Festschrift aaO 48&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gerhard Ebeling]], and [[James M. Robinson]] are the scholars who represent the new hermeneutics. And it is said that [[language event]] (German: ''Sprachereignis'', the word event) occurs continuously, not that the interpreter insists on the text, but the text continually asserts the interpreter. Fuchs' concern is not to ask for the meaning of the text, but to learn how to listen to unobtrusive language about human beings' existence according to the hermeneutical help given with the texts itself. Fuchs' achievement lay in bringing the insights of [[Karl Barth]], [[Rudolf Bultmann]], and [[Martin Heidegger]] into fruitful conjunction. He sought to bridge Barth's [[Calvinism|Calvinist]] emphasis on the revealed Word of God with Rudolf Bultmann's Lutheran emphasis on the nature of human existence before God by employing a phenomenology of language derived in part from Heidegger's later position, arguing that both human existence and the bring of God are ultimately linguistic-made available in language - and that theology is thus properly "faith's doctrine of language"(Sprachlehre des Glaubens). Theology's task is essentially hermeneutical, i.t.,{{huh|date=April 2018}} theology translates Scripture into contemporary terms and contemporary existence into scriptural terms. Fuchs' interests is language event with existential philosophy. Conversely, the reality of God's love is verbalized in Jesus' word and deeds recorded in the Gospels and is thus preserved as language gain (Sprachgewinn). In the freedom of proclamation God's presence in the gospel and the "Yes of love: happens again - that is, comes to be as language, opening up the future to authentic existence (faith, hope, and love).

'''Oksana Stefanivna Zabuzhko''' ({{lang-uk|Окса́на Стефа́нівна Забу́жко}}) is a [[Ukraine|Ukrainian]] novelist, poet, essayist. Her works has been translated into several languages.

== Life ==
Born 19 September 1960 in [[Lutsk]], [[Ukraine]], Zabuzhko studied philosophy at the [[Kiev University]], where she also obtained her [[doctorate]] in aesthetics in 1987. In 1992 she taught at [[Penn State University]] as a visiting writer. Zabuzhko won a [[Fulbright scholarship]] in 1994 and taught Ukrainian literature at [[Harvard university|Harvard]] and [[University of Pittsburgh]]. Currently Zabuzhko works at the [[Hryhori Skovoroda]] Institute of Philosophy of the [[National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine]].

== Literary work ==
According to Uilleam Blacker, Oksana Zabuzhko’s work has two main preoccupations: national identity and gender.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/stable/25698706?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents/ Uilleam Blacker. Nation, Body, Home: Gender and National Identity in the Work of Oksana Zabuzhko. ''[[The Modern Language Review]]'' 105.2 (2010): 487-501]&lt;/ref&gt; Zabuzhko’s first novel, ''[[Field Work in Ukrainian Sex]]'', published in 1996, was met with great controversy both by the critics and by the readers. With its publication, the Ukrainian readership and the intellectual community faced innovative, provocative and complex feminist writing.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/stable/40646240?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents/ Alexandra Hrycak and Maria G. Rewakowicz. Feminism, Intellectuals and the Formation of Micro-Publics in Postcommunist Ukraine. ''Studies in East European Thought''. Special issue ''Wither the Intelligentsia: The End of the Moral Elite in Eastern Europe.'' Ed. Serguei Alex. Oushakine. 61 (2009): 309-333]&lt;/ref&gt;

As a trained philosopher and cultural critic, Zabuzhko publishes essays and non-fiction works. Zabuzhko also turns to the Ukrainian history. Her most recent novel, ''[[The Museum of Abandoned Secrets]]'' (2009), deals with three different epochs ([[World War II]], 1970s, and early 2000s), and, in particular, the topic of [[Ukrainian Insurgent Army]], active in Ukraine in the 1940s and 1950s, and either demonized or silenced by the [[Soviet historiography]].

Oksana Zabuzhko belongs to the generation that [[Tamara Hundorova]], a literary scholar, calls «post-Chornobyl».&lt;ref name="Tamara Hundorova"&gt;Tamara Hundorova. Pisliachornobyl's'ka biblioteka. Ukrains'kyi literaturnyi postmodern. Kyiv: Krytyka, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Chornobyl catastrophe]] (1986), according to Hundorova, is not only one of the biggest calamities of the modern times, but also a «symbolic event that projects post-apocalyptical text […] into the post-atomic era».&lt;ref name="Tamara Hundorova" /&gt; Most importantly, Chornobyl also marks, de facto, the end of the Soviet Union, at least the end of any legitimacy of its ideology, and the beginning of the new Ukrainian society and new Ukrainian literature, free from socialist realism or consciously dismantling its legacy. One important feature of Oksana Zabuzhko’s writing is that it is «turned outward» to the world, to be accessible to the Western reader.&lt;ref name="Tamara Hundorova" /&gt;

== Major works and style ==

Oksana Zabuzhko’s first novel, ''[[Field Work in Ukrainian Sex]]'', is one of the key texts in post-Soviet Ukrainian literature.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ideals.illinois.edu/bitstream/handle/2142/45607/Oleksandra_Wallo.pdf?sequence=1/ Oleksandra Shchur (Wallo).

University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, 2013]&lt;/ref&gt; It caused great controversy upon its publication, due the fact that the narrator expresses dissatisfaction with the established order of relationships between sexes, where a woman is subject to [[oppression]], social and sexual, both by the traditional patriarchy, as a gendered subject, as well as a subject of [[totalitarianism]]. The novel was analyzed from the point of view of [[postcolonial theory]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com.ua/books?id=h3GbUlIBUu8C&amp;pg=PR4&amp;lpg=PR4&amp;dq=Vitaly+Chernetsky.+Mapping+Postcommunist+Cultures:+Russia+and+Ukraine+in+the+Context+of+Globalization.+Montreal:+McGill-Queen’s+University+Press,+2007.&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=A2W56Cpeeb&amp;sig=VrNyVTjZB7wG-A4w_n24AlHIpwc&amp;hl=uk&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjX6OfsjLbMAhWiYpoKHW0KDo0Q6AEIJzAC#v=onepage&amp;q=Vitaly%20Chernetsky.%20Mapping%20Postcommunist%20Cultures%3A%20Russia%20and%20Ukraine%20in%20the%20Context%20of%20Globalization.%20Montreal%3A%20McGill-Queen%E2%80%99s%20University%20Press%2C%202007.&amp;f=false/ Vitaly Chernetsky.

The novel was also studied on account of its prominent style, with the «poetic» voice and the «intellectual» voice intermingling and creating an intricate structure. The novel engages some elements of ''[[écriture féminine]]'', notably, writing (from) the body.

Oksana Zabuzhko’s second novel, ''[[Museum of Abandoned Secrets]]'', deals with Ukraine’s resistance and opposition to the [[Soviet]] colonial regime in the 20th century. The novel presents the reality of the relations between the countries that within the structure of the [[USSR]] were seen by the West only in the context of the myth of the «friendships of nations», the myth that Putin’s Russia would still like to perpetuate.

Oksana Zabuzhko’s most famous non-fiction book is ''[[Notre Dame d’Ukraine]]''. It focuses on the Ukrainian writer of the [[fin-de-siècle]] era, [[Lesya Ukrayinka]] (1871-1913), but is also a study of the Ukrainian intelligentsia of that time and their cultural values. More specifically, in this groundbreaking volume Zabuzhko shows Ukraine’s European legacy in regard to the tradition of chivalry and the ways in which it shaped the Ukrainian literature and mentality.

Her book ''Let My People Go'' won the [[Korrespondent]] magazine Best Ukrainian documentary book award in June 2006,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.kyivpost.com/news/guide/general/detail/24676/|title=Check out Ukraine’s best books|date=21 June 2006|publisher=''[[Kyiv Post]]''|accessdate=28 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Museum of Abandoned Secrets]]'' — Best Ukrainian Book — 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ua.korrespondent.net/showbiz/1091583-korrespondent-nazvav-peremozhciv-konkursu-krashcha-ukrayinska-kniga-2010 Корреспондент назвав переможців конкурсу Краща українська книга-2010]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Omraam Mikhaël Aïvanhov''' (Mihail Ivanov) (January 31, 1900 - December 25, 1986) was a [[Bulgarians|Bulgarian]] [[philosopher]], [[pedagogue]], [[mysticism|mystic]], and [[esotericist]]. A leading 20th-century teacher of [[Western Esotericism]] in [[Europe]], he was a disciple of [[Peter Deunov]] (Beinsa Douno), the founder of the [[Universal White Brotherhood]].&lt;ref name="Mel"/&gt;

==Life==
He was born '''Mikhail Dimitrov Ivanov''' in [[Srpci]] (then in the [[Manastir Vilayet]] of the [[Ottoman Empire]]), a village in [[Bitola Municipality]] in the present-day [[Republic of Macedonia]], to a [[Bulgarians|Bulgarian]] family.&lt;ref name="Mel"/&gt; His father, Ivan Dimitrov established a coal business&lt;ref name= Fren&gt;Louise-Marie Frenette (2008) ‘‘Omraam Mikhael Aivanhof: the Life of a Master in the West’’ Chapter2, p 9&lt;/ref&gt; and died when Aivanhov was seven years old.&lt;ref name=Feuer&gt;Feuerstein, Georg (1994). ‘‘The Mystery of Light: The Life and Teachings of Omraam Michael Aivanhov’’ Salt Lake City, UT: Morson Publishing, {{ISBN|1-878423-14-2}}; Kindle ed. Chapter2, Location 336&lt;/ref&gt;
 
His mother, Dolya was a religious woman, who dedicated her son to God since his very early childhood.&lt;ref&gt;Feuerstein, Georg (1994). Chapter 1, location 281-296&lt;/ref&gt; Like most Bulgarians who were the predominant ethnic element in the region of [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonia]] during that time, the family of Mikhail Ivanov was persecuted by the Greek army after the end of the [[Balkan War]].  They were forced to leave their home in spring, 1907 due to destruction of the village. The family finally found shelter and settled in [[Varna]], Bulgaria.&lt;ref name="Mel"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Feuerstein, Georg (1994). Chapter 1, location 406&lt;/ref&gt; At the age of 17, after a childhood passed in poverty, he met [[Peter_Deunov|Master Peter Deunov]] (1864 - 1944), the founder of the Universal White Brotherhood in the city of Varna, Bulgaria. A few months later in 1918, he followed Master Deunov to the capital, [[Sofia]].&lt;ref name="Mel"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Feuerstein, Georg (1994). Chapter2, Location 735&lt;/ref&gt;
  
During the early years of his [[discipleship]], Aivanhov was quite poor. He owned a bed, some [[books]], a violin (given to him by Deunov) and a few [[shabby]] clothes.  He spent most of his time on [[Spirituality|spiritual]] retreats in the mountains, where he studied and meditated, occasionally taking a job to earn his keep. Deunov also obliged him to broaden his conventional knowledge by pursuing studies at the [[University of Sofia]], and he enrolled in courses on [[psychology]], education [[philosophy]], [[mathematics]],  [[chemistry]], [[astronomy]] &amp; [[medicine]] between 1923 and 1931.  From around 1932 to around 1937, he worked as a school teacher and then a high [[school]] principal.&lt;ref&gt;Feuerstein, Georg (1994). Chapter 1 location 771-776&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Mel"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Prosv&gt;{{cite web | title = Omraam Mikhael Aivanhov Biography|publisher=Prosveta| url = http://www.prosveta.com/omraam-mikhael-aivanhov.phtml?language_id=5&amp;distributor_id=1&amp;SESSION_ID=PROSVETA528f3ca309175 | accessdate = 2017-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1937 with the approach of the Second World War, Peter Deunov foresaw that political unrest, war and the spread of [[communism]] would lead to a ban on all spiritual associations in Bulgaria and so he entrusted Mikhail Ivanov with bringing his teaching to France. Deunov chose Aivanhov out of 40,000 other students.&lt;ref name="Mel"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Feuerstein, Georg (1994). Chapter 1 location p849&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://fbucanada.com/en/omraam-mikhael-aivanhov/omraam-mikhael-aivanhov/ “Omraam Mikhael Aivanov”]. Retrieved 2017-10-24.&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 22, 1937 he arrived in [[France]] penniless, with no knowledge of French and only one contact person in France, Stella Bellemin, a Bulgarian [[expatriate]].  However, Aivanhov turned out to be an excellent linguist.  He took no money from his students or charged for his lectures apart from one exception when touring [[America]].  The money was banked and used later for a publishing project.  On January 29, 1938, he gave his first public talk in the Luxembourg Hall, Place de la Sorbonne.  This was the first of over 5000 conferences.&lt;ref&gt;Feuerstein, Georg (1994). Chapter 1 location p894-943&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Mel"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Frenette (2008) p722&lt;/ref&gt; In 1944 he published his first collection of talks.&lt;ref name=fbucan&gt;[http://fbucanada.com/en/omraam-mikhael-aivanhov/omraam-mikhael-aivanhov/2/ “chronology”]. Retrieved 2017-10-24&lt;/ref&gt; On January 21, 1948 he was arrested on a false [[Criminal charge|charge]] and sentenced to 4 years in prison, but in March 1950 he was released.&lt;ref name=fbucan/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Feuerstein, Georg (1994). Chapter 3, Location 1075&lt;/ref&gt;

He taught mainly in France, and he created the spiritual centers Bonfin in Fréjus, France and [[Izgrev, Sofia]] in his native Bulgaria, but also traveled a great deal. From 1938 until 1986 he gave some 4,500 talks in French, first of all in France (in [[Paris]] and its outskirts, and later at Fréjus in the Var region), and then in [[Switzerland]] (spiritual center Videlinata), [[Canada]], the United States, [[India]], Sweden and Norway. He also visited many other countries.

His works which include 44 pocketbooks and 32 complete works are based on his lectures, which were recorded first in shorthand and since 1960 on audio and video tape. Finally, in 1972 Prosveta Publications released several collections of these talks in the form of books and brochures (translated into 30 languages), CDs and DVDs with subtitles.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.prosveta-canada.com/anglais_accueil.html# Prosveta-Canada] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130420100923/http://www.prosveta-canada.com/anglais_accueil.html |date=2013-04-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Prosv/&gt;

In 1959, he traveled to India, where he met saint, [[Neem Karoli Baba]], whom Baba Ram Dass/[[Richard Alpert]] made famous in North America. Babaji referred to Aivanhov as 'the French Sadhu' The name Omraam was given to him by three sages who approached Aivanhov while he was in India, meditating and uttered the word 'Omraam' thereafter he was known as Omraam Mikhaël Aïvanhov. After this he allowed himself to be called "Master".&lt;ref name="Mel"&gt;{{cite book|author1=J.

==Central idea==

Aivanhov’s philosophy teaches that everybody, regardless of race, religion, social position, intellectual ability or material means, is able to take part in the realization of a new period of brotherhood and peace on earth. This happens through the individual's personal transformation: growth in perfection and in harmony with the divine world. Whatever the topic, he invariably focuses on how one can better conduct life on earth. Aivanhov taught that to achieve a better life, one must have a high ideal: "... if you have a High Ideal, such as the bringing of the Kingdom of God on earth, you obtain everything you wished for, you taste plenitude."&lt;ref name=highideal&gt;Omraam Mikhaël Aïvanhov [http://www.liveyourquest.com/ecrits/OMA-TheHighIdeal.pdf The High Ideal] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120317124636/http://www.liveyourquest.com/ecrits/OMA-TheHighIdeal.pdf |date=2012-03-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Initiatic Science==
Aïvanhov teaches the ancient principles of [[initiatic]] science. He describes the cosmic [[laws]] governing both the universe and the human being, the macrocosm and microcosm, and the exchanges that constantly take place between them.

This knowledge has taken different forms throughout the centuries. It is the perennial wisdom expressed through various religions, each adapted to the spirit of a particular time, people, and level of spiritual evolution. Aivanhov's teaching incorporates aspects of [[Esoteric Christianity]] that relate to finding the "Kingdom of God on earth" within the individual. One of the essential truths of initiatic science, according to Aivanhov, is that (in the higher world) all things are linked. Thus committing oneself to the Kingdom of God on earth makes it realizable: "The real science is to form within ourselves, in the depths of our being, this Body that Initiates call the Body of Glory, the Body of Light, the Body of Christ."&lt;ref name = highideal/&gt;

He was a lecturer at [[University College, Dublin]], a research fellow at [[Trinity Hall, Cambridge]], and professor at the [[University of Bradford]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cato-unbound.org/contributors/philip-pettit |title=Philip Pettit |publisher=Cato-unbound.org |date= |accessdate=2015-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was for many years professorial fellow in social and political theory at the Research School of Social Sciences, [[Australian National University]]. He is the recipient of numerous honours, including an [[honorary doctorate]] from the [[National University of Ireland]].
He was keynote speaker at Graduate Conference, [[University of Toronto]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://philosophy.utoronto.ca/events/graduate-conference-philipp-pettit-princeton-keynote-speaker ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110920140315/http://philosophy.utoronto.ca/events/graduate-conference-philipp-pettit-princeton-keynote-speaker |date=20 September 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pettit defends a version of [[civic republicanism]] in political philosophy.  His book ''Republicanism: A Theory of Freedom and Government'' provided the underlying justification for political reforms in Spain under [[José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.princeton.edu/~ppettit/tiempo.pdf |format=PDF |title=El maestro Pettit examina al alumno Zapatero |publisher=Princeton.edu |accessdate=2015-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Pettit detailed his relationship with Zapatero in his ''A Political Philosophy in Public Life: Civic Republicanism in Zapatero's Spain'', co-authored with José Luis Martí.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tampereclub.org/Marti_Pettit_New%20Statesman.pdf |format=PDF |title=The reading list |publisher=Tampereclub.org |accessdate=2015-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pettit holds that the lessons learned when thinking about problems in one area of philosophy often constitute ready-made solutions to problems faced in completely different areas.  Views he defends in philosophy of mind give rise to the solutions he offers to problems in metaphysics about the nature of free will, and to problems in the philosophy of the social sciences, and these in turn give rise to the solutions he provides to problems in moral philosophy and political philosophy. His corpus as a whole was the subject of a series of critical essays published in ''Common Minds: Themes from the Philosophy of Philip Pettit'' (Oxford University Press, 2007).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.oup.com/us/catalog/general/subject/Philosophy/Mind/?view=usa&amp;ci=9780199218165 |title=Common Minds - Geoffrey Brennan; Robert Goodin; Frank Jackson; Michael Smith - Oxford University Press |publisher=Oup.com |date=2007-07-19 |accessdate=2015-03-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121019041646/http://www.oup.com/us/catalog/general/subject/Philosophy/Mind/?view=usa&amp;ci=9780199218165 |archivedate=19 October 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Prepositions''' and '''postpositions''', together called '''adpositions''' (or broadly, in English, simply '''prepositions'''),&lt;ref name="HP602"/&gt; are a [[part of speech|class of words]] used to express spatial or temporal relations (''in'', ''under'', ''towards'', ''before'') or mark various [[thematic relations|semantic roles]] (''of'', ''for'').&lt;ref&gt;Huddleston &amp; Pullum (2002), chapter 7.&lt;/ref&gt;

A preposition or postposition typically combines with a [[noun]] or [[pronoun]], or more generally a [[noun phrase]], this being called its [[complement (grammar)|complement]], or sometimes [[object (grammar)|object]]. A preposition comes before its complement; a postposition comes after its complement. English generally has prepositions rather than postpositions – words such as ''in'', ''under'' and ''of'' precede their objects, such as ''in England'', ''under the table'', ''of Jane'' – although there are a few exceptions including "ago" and "notwithstanding", as in "three days ago" and "financial limitations notwithstanding". Some languages that use a different word order, have postpositions instead, or have both types. The [[phrase]] formed by a preposition or postposition together with its complement is called a [[prepositional phrase]] (or postpositional phrase, adpositional phrase, etc.) – such phrases usually play an [[adverbial]] role in a sentence.

A less common type of adposition is the '''circumposition''', which consists of two parts that appear on each side of the complement. [[#Classification by position|Other terms]] sometimes used for particular types of adposition include ''ambiposition'', ''inposition'' and ''interposition''. Some linguists use the word ''preposition'' in place of ''adposition'' regardless of the applicable word order.&lt;ref name="HP602"&gt;An example is Huddleston &amp; Pullum (2002) ("''CGEL''"), whose choice of terms is discussed on p. 602.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Terminology==
The word ''preposition'' comes from {{lang-la|prae}} ("before") and {{lang-la|ponere}} ("to put"). This refers  to the situation in Latin and [[Ancient Greek grammar|Greek]] (and in [[English grammar|English]]), where such words are placed before their complement (except sometimes in Ancient Greek), and are hence "pre-positioned".

In some languages, including [[Sindhi language|Sindhi]], [[Urdu language|Urdu]], [[Turkish language|Turkish]], [[Hindi language|Hindi]], [[Korean language|Korean]], and [[Japanese language|Japanese]], the same kind of words typically come after their complement. To indicate this, they are called ''postpositions'' (using the prefix ''post-'', from Latin ''post'' meaning "behind, after"). There are also some cases where the function is performed by two parts coming before and after the complement; this is called a ''circumposition'' (from Latin ''circum'' "around").

In some languages, for example [[Finnish language|Finnish]], some adpositions can be used as both prepositions and postpositions. 

Prepositions, postpositions and circumpositions are collectively known as ''adpositions'' (using the Latin prefix ''ad-'', meaning "to"). However, some linguists prefer to use the well-known and longer established term ''preposition'' in place of ''adposition'', irrespective of position relative to the complement.&lt;ref name="HP602" /&gt;

==Grammatical properties==
An adposition typically combines with exactly one [[complement (linguistics)|complement]], most often a [[noun phrase]] (or, in a different analysis, a [[determiner phrase]]). In English, this is generally a noun (or something functioning as a noun, e.g., a [[gerund]]), together with its [[Specifier (linguistics)|specifier]] and [[modifier (grammar)|modifiers]] such as [[article (grammar)|article]]s, [[adjective]]s, etc. The complement is sometimes called the [[object (grammar)|object]] of the adposition. The resulting [[phrase]], formed by the adposition together with its complement, is called an [[adpositional phrase]] or prepositional phrase (PP) (or for specificity, a postpositional or circumpositional phrase).

An adposition establishes a [[grammar|grammatical]] relationship that links its complement to another word or phrase in the context. It also generally establishes a [[semantic]] relationship, which may be spatial (''in'', ''on'', ''under'', ...), temporal (''after'', ''during'', ...), or of some other type (''of'', ''for'', ''via'', ...). The [[World Atlas of Language Structures]] treats a word as an adposition if it takes a noun phrase as a complement and indicates the grammatical or semantic relationship of that phrase to the verb in the containing clause.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Chapter 85: Order of Adposition and Noun Phrase|url=http://wals.info/chapter/85|work=World Atlas of Language Structures|accessdate=29 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some examples of the use of English prepositions are given below. In each case, the prepositional phrase appears in ''italics'', the preposition within it appears in '''''bold''''', and the preposition's [[complement (grammar)|complement]] is &lt;u&gt;underlined&lt;/u&gt;. As demonstrated in some of the examples, more than one prepositional phrase may act as an [[adjunct (grammar)|adjunct]] to the same word.
* As an adjunct to a noun:
** the weather '''''in''' &lt;u&gt;March&lt;/u&gt;''
** cheese '''''from''' &lt;u&gt;France&lt;/u&gt;'' '''''with''' &lt;u&gt;live bacteria&lt;/u&gt;''
* As a [[predicative expression]] (complement of a [[copula (linguistics)|copula]])
** The key is '''''under''' &lt;u&gt;the stone&lt;/u&gt;''.
* As an adjunct to a verb:
** sleep '''''throughout''' &lt;u&gt;the winter&lt;/u&gt;''
** danced '''''atop''' &lt;u&gt;the tables&lt;/u&gt; '''for''' &lt;u&gt;hours&lt;/u&gt;''
** dispense '''''with''' &lt;u&gt;the formalities&lt;/u&gt;'' (see [[#Semantic functions|Semantic functions]], below)
* As an adjunct to an adjective:
** happy '''''for''' &lt;u&gt;them&lt;/u&gt;''
** sick '''''until''' &lt;u&gt;recently&lt;/u&gt;''

In the last of these examples the complement has the form of an adverb, which has been [[nominalization|nominalised]] to serve as a noun phrase; see [[#Different forms of complement|Different forms of complement]], below. Prepositional phrases themselves are sometimes nominalized:
* '''''In''' &lt;u&gt;the cellar&lt;/u&gt;'' was chosen as the best place to hide the bodies.

An adposition may determine the [[grammatical case]] of its complement. In English, the complements of prepositions take the [[objective case]] where available (''from him'', not *''from he''). In [[Koine Greek]], for example, certain prepositions always take their objects in a certain case (e.g., ἐν always takes its object in the dative), while other prepositions may take their object in one of two or more cases, depending on the meaning of the preposition (e.g., διά takes its object in the genitive or in the accusative, depending on the meaning). Some languages have cases that are used exclusively after prepositions ([[prepositional case]]), or special forms of [[pronoun]]s for use after prepositions ([[prepositional pronoun]]).

The functions of adpositions overlap with those of case markings (for example, the meaning of the English preposition ''of'' is expressed in many languages by a [[genitive case]] ending), but adpositions are classed as [[syntactic]] elements, while case markings are [[morphology (linguistics)|morphological]].

Adpositions themselves are usually [[Uninflected word|non-inflecting]] ("invariant"): they do not have paradigms of form (such as tense, case, gender, etc.)  the same way that verbs, adjectives, and nouns can. There are exceptions, though, such as prepositions that have fused with a pronominal object to form [[inflected preposition]]s.

The following properties are characteristic of most adpositional systems:
* Adpositions are among the most frequently occurring words in languages that have them. For example, one frequency ranking for English word forms&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wordcount.org/main.php|title=Wordcount · Tracking the Way We Use Language|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; begins as follows (prepositions in bold):
::''the, '''of''', and, '''to''', a, '''in''', that, it, is, was, I, '''for''', '''on''', you'', …
* The most common adpositions are single, [[morpheme|monomorphemic]] words. According to the ranking cited above, for example, the most common English prepositions are ''on'', ''in'', ''to'', ''by'', ''for'', ''with'', ''at'', ''of'', ''from'', ''as'', all of which are single-syllable words and cannot be broken down into smaller units of meaning.
* Adpositions form a [[closed class]] of lexical items and cannot be productively derived from words of other categories.

==Classification by position==
As noted above, adpositions are referred to by various terms, depending on their position relative to the complement.

While the term ''preposition'' is sometimes used to denote any adposition, in its stricter meaning it refers only to one which precedes its complement. Examples of this, from English, have been given above; similar examples can be found in many European and other languages, for example:
*[[German grammar|German]]: '''''mit''' einer Frau'' ("'''with''' a woman")
*[[French grammar|French]]: '''''sur''' la table'' ("'''on''' the table")
*[[Polish grammar|Polish]]: '''''na''' stole'' ("'''on''' the table")
*[[Russian grammar|Russian]]: '''''у''' меня'' ("'''in the possession of''' me" [I have])
*[[Khmer grammar|Khmer]]: '''លើ'''ក្តារខៀន ['''ləː''' kdaːkʰiən] ("'''on''' (the) blackboard")
*[[Tigrinya grammar|Tigrinya]]: '''አብ ልዕሊ''' ጣውላ ['''abː''' '''l:ali''' tawla] ("'''at/on''' '''top''' table"); '''አብ ትሕቲ''' ጣውላ ['''abː''' '''t:hti''' tawla] ("'''at/on''' '''under''' table")

In certain grammatical constructions, the complement of a preposition may be absent or may be moved from its position directly following the preposition. This may be referred to as [[preposition stranding]] (see also [[#Stranding|below]]), as in "Whom did you go '''with'''?" and  "There's only one thing worse than being talked '''about'''." There are also some (mainly colloquial) expressions in which a preposition's complement may be omitted, such as "I'm going to the park. Do you want to come '''with''' [me]?", and the French ''Il fait trop froid, je ne suis pas habillée '''pour''''' ("It's too cold, I'm not dressed '''for''' [the situation].")
The bolded words in these examples are generally still considered prepositions, because when they form a phrase with a complement (in more ordinary constructions) they must appear first.

A ''postposition'' follows its complement to form a postpositional phrase. Examples include:
*[[Latin language|Latin]]: ''me'''cum''''' ("'''with''' me", literally "me '''with'''")
*[[Turkish grammar|Turkish]]: ''benim'''le''''' or ''benim '''ile''''' ("'''with''' me", literally "my '''with'''") 
*[[Chinese language|Chinese]]: 桌子'''上''' ''zhuōzi '''shàng''''' (lit. "table '''on'''"); this is a nominal form which usually requires an additional preposition to form an adverbial phrase (see [[Chinese grammar#Locative phrases|Chinese locative phrases]])
*English: ''ten months '''ago''''' (''ago'' is normally considered an adverb, but is sometimes analyzed as a postposition)&lt;ref&gt;Sylvia Chalker, Edmund Weiner, ''The Oxford Dictionary of English Grammar'', OUP 1994. Entry for ''postposition''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some adpositions can appear either before or after their complement:
* English: ''the evidence '''notwithstanding''''' OR '''''notwithstanding''' the evidence''
* German: ''meiner Meinung '''nach''''' OR '''''nach''' meiner Meinung'' ("'''in''' my opinion")
* German: ''die Straße '''entlang''''' OR '''''entlang''' der Straße'' ("'''along''' the road"; here a different [[grammatical case|case]] is used when ''entlang'' precedes the noun)
 
An adposition like the above, which can be either a preposition or a postposition, can be called an '''ambiposition'''.&lt;ref&gt;See Reindl (2001), Libert (2006).&lt;/ref&gt; However, ''ambiposition'' may also be used to refer to a circumposition (see below),&lt;ref&gt;Gernot Windfuhr, ''Iranian Languages'', Routledge 2013 p. 736.&lt;/ref&gt; or to a word that appears to function as a preposition and postposition simultaneously, as in the [[Vedic Sanskrit]] construction (noun-1) ''ā'' (noun-2), meaning "from (noun-1) to (noun-2)".&lt;ref&gt;Vít Bubeník, ''From Case to Adposition: The Development of Configurational Syntax in Indo-European Languages'', John Benjamins Publishing 2006, p. 109.&lt;/ref&gt;

Whether a language has primarily prepositions or postpositions is seen as an aspect of its [[Linguistic typology|typological]] classification, and tends to correlate with other properties related to [[head directionality]]. Since an adposition is regarded as the [[head (linguistics)|head]] of its phrase, prepositional phrases are head-initial (or right-[[branching (linguistics)|branching]]), while postpositional phrases are head-final (or left-branching). There is a tendency for languages that feature postpositions also to have other head-final features, such as [[subject–object–verb|verbs that follow their objects]]; and for languages that feature prepositions to have other head-initial features, such as [[subject–verb–object|verbs that precede their objects]]. This is only a tendency, however; an example of a language that behaves differently is [[Latin grammar|Latin]], which employs mostly prepositions, even though it typically places verbs after their objects.

A ''circumposition'' consists of two or more parts, positioned on both sides of the complement. Circumpositions are very common in [[Pashto language|Pashto]] and [[Kurdish language|Kurdish]]. The following are examples from [[Northern Kurdish]] (Kurmanji):
* ''bi ... re'' ("with")
* ''di ... de'' ("in", for things, not places)
* ''di ... re'' ("via, through")
* ''ji ... re'' ("for")
* ''ji ... ve'' ("since")

Various constructions in other languages might also be analyzed as circumpositional, for example:
* English: '''''from''' now '''on'''''
* [[Dutch language|Dutch]]: '''''naar''' het einde '''toe''''' ("towards the end", lit. "to the end to")
* [[Standard Chinese|Chinese]]: '''從'''冰箱'''裡''' '''''cóng''' bīngxiāng '''lǐ''''' ("from the inside of the refrigerator", lit. "from refrigerator inside")
* [[French language|French]]: '''''à''' un détail '''près''''' ("except for one detail", lit. "at one detail near")
* [[Swedish language|Swedish]]: '''''för''' tre timmar '''sedan''''' ("three hours ago", lit. "for three hours since")
* [[German language|German]]: '''''aus''' dem Zimmer '''heraus''''' ("out from the room", lit. "from the room out")
* [[Tigrinya language|Tigrinya]]: '''''ካብ ''' ሕጂ ''''''ን'''ደሓር ("from now on", lit. "from now to later")
Most such phrases, however, can be analyzed as having a different hierarchical structure (such as a prepositional phrase modifying a following adverb). The Chinese example could be analyzed as a prepositional phrase headed by ''cóng'' ("from"), taking the [[Chinese grammar#Locative phrases|locative noun phrase]] ''bīngxīang lǐ'' ("refrigerator inside") as its complement.

An '''inposition''' is a rare type of adposition that appears between parts of a complex complement. For example, in the native Californian [[Timbisha language]], the phrase "from a mean cold" can be translated using the word order "cold from mean"—the inposition follows the noun but precedes any following [[modifier (grammar)|modifier]]s that form part of the same [[noun phrase]].&lt;ref&gt;Matthew S. Dryer, [http://wals.info/chapter/85 "Order of Adposition and Noun Phrase"], in ''The World Atlas of Language Structures Online''. Retrieved 2015-01-01.&lt;/ref&gt; The Latin word ''cum'' is also commonly used as an inposition, as in the phrase ''[[summa cum laude]]'', meaning "with highest praise", lit. "highest with praise".

The term '''interposition''' has been used&lt;ref&gt;See Melis (2003), p. 22. The term is used here in French, and in reference to the French language.&lt;/ref&gt; for adpositions in structures such as ''word '''for''' word'', (French) ''coup '''sur''' coup'' ("one after another, repeatedly"), (Russian) друг '''с''' другом ("one with the other"). This is not a case of an adposition appearing inside its complement, as the two nouns do not form a single phrase (there is no phrase *''word word'', for example); such uses have more of a [[coordination (linguistics)|coordinating]] character.

==Stranding==
{{Main|Preposition stranding}}

Preposition stranding is a [[syntax|syntactic]] construct in which a preposition occurs somewhere other than immediately before its complement. For example, in the English sentence "What did you sit on?" the preposition ''on'' has ''what'' as its complement, but ''what'' is [[Wh-fronting|moved to the start]] of the sentence, because it is an [[interrogative word]]. This sentence is much more common and natural than the equivalent sentence without stranding: "On what did you sit?" Preposition stranding is commonly found in [[English language|English]],&lt;ref name="CB1"&gt;{{cite web| last=Lundin|first=Leigh |title=The Power of Prepositions |url=http://criminalbrief.com/?p=216 |work=On Writing |publisher=Criminal Brief |location=Cairo |date=2007-09-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as [[North Germanic languages]] such as [[Swedish language|Swedish]]. Its existence in [[German language|German]] and [[Dutch language|Dutch]] is debated. Preposition stranding is also found in some [[Niger–Congo languages]] such as Vata and Gbadi, and in some North American varieties of [[French language|French]].

Some prescriptive English grammars teach that prepositions cannot end a sentence, although there is [[List of common English usage misconceptions|no rule]] prohibiting that use.&lt;ref name="Mignon Fogarty"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://grammar.quickanddirtytips.com/top-ten-grammar-myths.aspx|title= Top Ten Grammar Myths|first= Mignon |last=Fogarty|date= 4 March 2010|work= Grammar Girl: Quick and Dirty Tips for Better Writing|accessdate= 27 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Random House"&gt;{{cite book |title= Origins of the Specious: Myths and Misconceptions of the English Language|last1= O'Conner|first1= Patricia T.|last2= Kellerman|first2= Stewart|year= 2009|publisher= Random House|location= New York|isbn= 978-1-4000-6660-5|page=17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar rules arose during the rise of classicism, when they were applied to English in imitation of classical languages such as Latin. [[Otto Jespersen]], in his ''Essentials of English Grammar'' (first published 1933), commented on this definition-derived rule: "...nor need a preposition (Latin: ''praepositio'') stand before the word it governs (go the fools ''among'' (Sh[akespeare]); What are you laughing ''at''?). You might just as well believe that all blackguards are black or that turkeys come from Turkey; many names have either been chosen unfortunately at first or have changed their meanings in course of time."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Jespersen|first=Otto|authorlink=Otto Jespersen|title=Essentials of English Grammar|year=1962|location=London|publisher=George Allen &amp; Unwin|page=69|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cyAhxH035RUC&amp;pg=PT96}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Simple ''versus'' complex==

'''Simple''' adpositions consist of a single word (''on'', ''in'', ''for'', ''towards'', etc.). '''Complex''' adpositions consist of a group of words that act as one unit. Examples of complex prepositions in English include ''in spite of'', ''with respect to'', ''except for'', ''by dint of'', and ''next to''.

The distinction between simple and complex adpositions is not clear-cut. Many simple adpositions are derived from complex forms (e.g., ''with + in'' → ''within'', ''by + side'' → ''beside'') through [[grammaticalisation]]. This change takes time, and during the transitional stages the adposition acts in some ways like a single word, and in other ways like a multi-word unit. For example, current [[German orthography|German orthographic conventions]] recognize the indeterminate status of certain prepositions, allowing two spellings: ''anstelle''/''an Stelle'' ("instead of"), ''aufgrund''/''auf Grund'' ("because of"), ''mithilfe''/''mit Hilfe'' ("by means of"), ''zugunsten''/''zu Gunsten'' ("in favor of"), ''zuungunsten''/''zu Ungunsten'' ("to the disadvantage of"), ''zulasten/zu Lasten'' ("at the expense of").&lt;ref&gt;[[Duden]]: ''Neue Rechtschreibung Crashkurs ([http://www.duden.de/deutsche_sprache/neue_rechtschreibung/crashkurs/getrenntzusammen/regel_11.php Regel 11] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080312003114/http://www.duden.de/deutsche_sprache/neue_rechtschreibung/crashkurs/getrenntzusammen/regel_11.php |date=2008-03-12 }})''.&lt;/ref&gt;

The distinction between complex adpositions and free combinations of words is not a black and white issue: complex adpositions (in English, "prepositional idioms") can be more fossilized or less fossilized. In English, this applies to a number of structures of the form "preposition + (article) + noun + preposition", such as ''in front of'', ''for the sake of''.&lt;ref&gt;''CGEL'', p. 618ff; Pullum (2005); Huddleston and Pullum (2005), pp. 146-47.&lt;/ref&gt; The following characteristics are good indications that a given combination is "frozen" enough to be considered a complex preposition in English:&lt;ref&gt;Quirk and Mulholland (1964).&lt;!--Check this ref, it may not support the whole of this--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
* It contains a word that cannot be used in any other context: ''by dint of'', ''in lieu of''.
* The first preposition cannot be replaced: ''with a view to'' but not *''for/without a view to''.
* It is impossible to insert an article, or to use a different article: ''on account of'' but not *''on an/the account of''; ''for the sake of'' but not *''for a sake of''.
* The range of possible adjectives is very limited: ''in great favor of'', but not *''in helpful favor of''.
* The [[grammatical number]] of the noun cannot be changed: ''by virtue of'' but not *''by virtues of''.
* It is impossible to use a [[possessive determiner]]: ''in spite of him'', not *''in his spite''.

==Proper ''versus'' improper==

In descriptions of some languages, prepositions are divided into '''proper''' (or ''essential'') and '''improper''' (or ''accidental''). A preposition is called improper if it is some other part of speech being used in the same way as a preposition. Examples of simple and complex prepositions that have been so classified include ''prima di'' ("before") and ''davanti (a)'' ("in front of") in [[Italian grammar|Italian]],&lt;ref&gt;Maria Franca Zuccarello, Edvaldo Sampaio Belizário, [http://www.filologia.org.br/xiicnlf/16/07.pdf As preposições acidentais (preposizioni improprie) italianas e seus termos correpondentes em português], CNLF, Vol. XII No. 16, p. 72.&lt;/ref&gt; and ''ergo'' ("on account of") and ''causa'' ("for the sake of") in [[Latin grammar|Latin]].&lt;ref&gt;Harm Pinkster, ''On Latin Adverbs'', Amsterdam University Press 2005, p. 148.&lt;/ref&gt;  In reference to [[Ancient Greek language|Ancient Greek]], however, an improper preposition is one that cannot also serve as a [[prefix]] to a [[verb]].&lt;ref&gt;Stanley E. Porter, ''Idioms of the Greek New Testament'', A&amp;C Black 1992, p. 140.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Different forms of complement==
As noted above, adpositions typically have [[noun phrase]]s as complements. This can include [[nominal clause]]s and certain types of [[non-finite verb]] phrase:
*We can't agree '''''on''' whether to have children or not'' (complement is a nominal clause)
*Let's think '''''about''' solving this problem'' (complement is a [[gerund]] phrase)
*'''''pour''' encourager les autres'' (French: "to encourage the others", complement is an [[infinitive]] phrase)

The word ''to'' when it precedes the [[Uses of English verb forms#Infinitive|infinitive in English]] is not a preposition, but rather is a grammatical [[particle (grammar)|particle]] outside of any main [[word class]].

In other cases the complement may have the form of an adjective or [[adjective phrase]], or an adverbial. This may be regarded as a complement representing a different [[syntactic category]], or simply as an atypical form of noun phrase (see [[nominalization]]).
*The scene went '''''from''' blindingly bright '''to''' pitch black'' (complements are adjective phrases)
*I worked there '''''until''' recently'' (complement is an adverb)
*Come out '''''from''' under the bed'' (complement is an adverbial)
In the last example, the complement of the preposition ''from'' is in fact another prepositional phrase. The resulting sequence of two prepositions (''from under'') may be regarded as a [[#Simple and complex adpositions|complex]] preposition; in some languages such a sequence may be represented by a single word, as Russian из-под ''iz-pod'' ("from under").

Some adpositions appear to combine with two complements:
* '''''With''' Sammy president'', we can all come out of hiding again.
* '''''For''' Sammy to become president'', they'd have to seriously modify the Constitution.
It is more commonly assumed, however, that ''Sammy'' and the following predicate forms a "[[small clause]]", which then becomes the single complement of the preposition.  (In the first example, a word such as may be considered [[elliptical construction|elided]], which, if present, would clarify the grammatical relationship.)

==Semantic functions==

Adpositions can be used to express a wide range of [[semantics|semantic]] relations between their complement and the rest of the context. The relations expressed may be spatial (denoting location or direction), temporal (denoting position in time), or relations expressing comparison, content, agent, instrument, means, manner, cause, purpose, reference, etc.

Most common adpositions are highly [[Polysemy|polysemous]] (they have various different meanings). In many cases a primary, spatial meaning becomes extended to non-spatial uses by [[metaphor]]ical or other processes. Because of the variety of meanings, a single adposition often has many possible equivalents in another language, depending on the exact context in which it is used; this can cause significant difficulties in foreign [[language learning]]. Usage can also vary between dialects of the same language (for example, [[American English]] has ''on the weekend'', where [[British English]] uses ''at the weekend'').

In some contexts (as in the case of some [[phrasal verb]]s) the choice of adposition may be determined by another element in the construction or be fixed by the construction as a whole. Here the adposition may have little independent semantic content of its own, and there may be no clear reason why the particular adposition is used rather than another. Examples of such expressions are:
* English: ''dispense '''with''''', ''listen '''to''''', ''insist '''on''''', ''proud '''of''''', ''good '''at'''''
* [[Russian language|Russian]]: ''otvechat' '''na''' vopros'' ("answer the question", literally "answer on the question"), ''obvinenie '''v''' obmane'' ("accusation of [literally: in] fraud")
* [[Spanish language|Spanish]]: ''soñar '''con''' ganar el título'' ("dream about [lit. with] winning the title"), ''consistir '''en''' dos grupos'' ("consist of [lit. in] two groups")

Prepositions sometimes mark roles that may be considered largely grammatical:
* [[Possession (linguistics)|possession]] (in a broad sense) – ''the pen '''of''' my aunt'' (sometimes marked by [[genitive]] or [[possessive]] forms)
* the agent in [[passive voice|passive]] constructions – ''killed '''by''' a lone gunman''
* the recipient of a transfer – ''give it '''to''' him'' (sometimes marked by a [[dative]] or an [[indirect object]])

Spatial meanings of adpositions may be either ''directional'' or ''static''. A directional meaning usually involves motion in a particular direction ("Kay went '''to''' the store"), the direction in which something leads or points ("A path '''into''' the woods"), or the extent of something ("The fog stretched '''from''' London '''to''' Paris"). A static meaning indicates only a location ("'''at''' the store", "'''behind''' the chair", "'''on''' the moon"). Some prepositions can have both uses: "he sat '''in''' the water" (static); "he jumped in the water" (probably directional). In some languages, the [[grammatical case|case]] of the complement varies depending on the meaning, as with several prepositions in [[German grammar|German]], such as ''in'':
* ''in seinem Zimmer'' ("in his room", static meaning, takes the [[dative]])
* ''in sein Zimmer'' ("into his room", directional meaning, takes the [[accusative]])

In English and many other languages, prepositional phrases with static meaning are commonly used as [[predicative expression]]s after a [[copula (linguistics)|copula]] ("Bob is at the store"); this may happen with some directional prepositions as well ("Bob is from Australia"), but this is less common. Directional prepositional phrases combine mostly with verbs that indicate movement ("Jay is going into her bedroom", but not *"Jay is lying down into her bedroom").

Directional meanings can be further divided into ''[[telicity|telic]]'' and ''atelic''. Telic prepositional phrases imply movement all the way to the endpoint ("she ran to the fence"), while atelic ones do not ("she ran towards the fence").&lt;ref&gt;Zwarts, Joost. 2005. "Prepositional Aspect and the Algebra of Paths." ''Linguistics and Philosophy'' 28.6, 739–779.&lt;/ref&gt;

Static meanings can be divided into ''projective'' and ''non-projective'', where projective meanings are those whose understanding requires knowledge of the perspective or point of view. For example, the meaning of "behind the rock" is likely to depend on the position of the speaker (projective), whereas the meaning of "on the desk" is not (non-projective). Sometimes the interpretation is ambiguous, as in "behind the house", which may mean either at the natural back of the house, or on the opposite side of the house from the speaker.&lt;ref&gt;Creswell, Max. 1978. "Prepositions and points of view." ''Linguistics and Philosophy'', 2: 1–41.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overlaps with other categories==

===Adverbs and particles===
There are often similarities in form between adpositions and [[adverb]]s. Some adverbs are derived from the fusion of a preposition and its complement (such as ''downstairs'', from ''down (the) stairs'', and ''underground'', from ''under (the) ground''). Some words can function both as adverbs and as prepositions, such as ''inside'', ''aboard'', ''underneath'' (for instance, one can say "go inside", with adverbial use, or "go inside the house", with prepositional use). Such cases are analogous to verbs that can be used either [[transitive verb|transitively]] or intransitively, and the adverbial forms might therefore be analyzed as "intransitive prepositions". This analysis&lt;ref&gt;See for example ''CGEL'', pp. 612–16.&lt;/ref&gt; could also be extended to other adverbs, such as ''here'', ''there'', ''afterwards'', etc., even though these never take complements.

Many English [[phrasal verb]]s contain [[Grammatical particle|particles]] that are used adverbially, even though they mostly have the form of a preposition (such words may be called [[prepositional adverb]]s). Examples are ''on'' in ''carry on'', ''get on'', etc., ''over'' in ''take over'', ''fall over'', and so on. The equivalents in [[Dutch grammar|Dutch]] and [[German grammar|German]] are [[separable prefix]]es, which also often have the same form as prepositions: for example, Dutch ''aanbieden'' and German ''anbieten'' (both meaning "to offer") contain the separable prefix ''aan/an'', which is also a preposition meaning "on" or "to".

===Conjunctions===

Some words can be used both as adpositions and as [[subordinating conjunction]]s:
* (preposition) '''''before'''/'''after'''/'''since''' the end of the summer''
* (conjunction) '''''before'''/'''after'''/'''since''' the summer ended''
* (preposition) ''It looks '''like''' another rainy day''
* (conjunction) ''It looks '''like''' it's going to rain again today''
It would be possible to analyze such conjunctions (or even other subordinating conjunctions) as prepositions that take an entire [[clause (grammar)|clause]] as a complement.

===Verbs===

In some languages, including a number of [[varieties of Chinese|Chinese varieties]], many of the words that serve as prepositions can also be used as [[verb]]s. For instance, in [[Standard Chinese]], 到 ''dào'' can be used in either a prepositional or a verbal sense:
* 我到北京去 ''wǒ dào Běijīng qù'' ("I go to Beijing"; ''qù'', meaning "to go", is the main verb, ''dào'' is prepositional meaning "to")
* 我到了 ''wǒ dào le'' ("I have arrived"; ''dào'' is the main verb, meaning "to arrive")
Because of this overlap, and the fact that a sequence of prepositional phrase and verb phrase often resembles a [[serial verb construction]], Chinese prepositions (and those of other languages with similar grammatical structures) are often referred to as [[coverb]]s.

As noted in previous sections, Chinese can also be said to have postpositions, although these can be analyzed as nominal ([[noun]]) elements. For more information, see the article on [[Chinese grammar]], particularly the sections on [[Chinese grammar#Coverbs|coverbs]] and [[Chinese grammar#Locative phrases|locative phrases]].

===Case affixes===

Some [[grammatical case]] markings have a similar function to adpositions; a case affix in one language may be equivalent in meaning to a preposition or postposition in another. For example, in English the agent of a [[passive voice|passive]] construction is marked by the preposition ''by'', while in [[Russian grammar|Russian]] it is marked by use of the [[instrumental case]]. Sometimes such equivalences exist within a single language; for example, the [[genitive]] case in [[German grammar|German]] is often interchangeable with a phrase using the preposition ''von'' (just as in English, the preposition ''of'' is often interchangeable with the [[English possessive|possessive suffix]] '' 's'').

Adpositions combine [[syntax|syntactically]] with their complement, whereas case markings combine with a noun [[morphology (linguistics)|morphologically]]. In some instances it may not be clear which applies; the following are some possible means of making such a distinction:
* Two adpositions can usually be joined with a [[coordinating conjunction]] and share a single complement (''of and for the people''), whereas this is generally not possible with case affixes;
* One adposition can usually combine with two coordinated complements (''of the city and the world''), whereas a case affix would need to be repeated with each noun ([[Latin language|Latin]] ''urbis et orbis'', not *urb- et orbis'');
* Case markings combine primarily with nouns, whereas adpositions can combine with (nominalized) phrases of different categories;
* A case marking usually appears directly on the noun, but an adposition can be separated from the noun by other words;
* Within the noun phrase, determiners and adjectives may agree with the noun in case ('''case spreading'''), but an adposition only appears once;
* A language can have hundreds of adpositions (including complex adpositions), but no language has that many distinct morphological cases.

Even so, a clear distinction cannot always be made. For example, the post-nominal elements in [[Japanese language|Japanese]] and [[Korean language|Korean]] are sometimes called case particles and sometimes postpositions. Sometimes they are analysed as two different groups because they have different characteristics (e.g., the ability to combine with focus particles), but in such analysis, it is unclear which words should fall into which group.

[[Turkish grammar|Turkish]] and [[Finnish grammar|Finnish]] have both extensive case-marking and postpositions, but here there is evidence to help distinguish the two:
* Turkish: (case) ''sinema'''ya''''' (cinema-''dative'', "to the cinema") vs. (postposition) ''sinema '''için''''' ("for the cinema")
* Finnish: (case) ''talo'''ssa''''' (house-''[[inessive]]'', "in the house") vs. (postposition) "talon '''edessä''' (house-''genitive'' in front, "in front of the house")
In these examples, the case markings form a word with their hosts (as shown by [[vowel harmony]], other word-internal effects and agreement of adjectives in Finnish), while the postpositions are independent words. As is seen in the last example, adpositions are often used in conjunction with case affixes – in languages that have case, a given adposition usually takes a complement in a particular case, and sometimes (as has been seen [[#Grammatical properties|above]]) the choice of case helps specify the meaning of the adposition.

'''P&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;G''' ('''Public Population Project in Genomics''' '''and Society''') is a [[Non-profit organization|not-for-profit]] [[International organization|international consortium]] dedicated to facilitating collaboration between researchers and biobanks working in the area of [[Population genetics|human population genomics]].&lt;ref&gt;European Journal of Human Genetics (2008) 16, 664–665; {{doi|10.1038/ejhg.2008.55}}; published online 2 April 2008  Population Genomics: The Public Population Project in Genomics (P3G): a proof of concept? http://www.nature.com/ejhg/journal/v16/n6/full/ejhg200855a.html&lt;/ref&gt;
P&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;G is member-based and composed of experts from the different disciplines in the areas of and related to genomics, including [[epidemiology]], [[law]], [[ethics]], [[technology]], [[Molecular biology|biomolecular science]], etc.
P&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;G and its members are committed to a philosophy of information sharing with the goal of supporting researchers working in areas that will improve the [[health]] of people around the world.

== The Organization ==

P&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;G is a [[not-for-profit organization]] with members from over 40 countries. Membership falls under two different categories: Institutional and Individual. Institutional members have the right to elect and vote the [[board of directors]] of P³G, and all members are eligible for office.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.p3g.org/secretariat|title= Website of P&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;G's Secretariat|deadurl= yes|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20091118182504/http://www.p3g.org/secretariat/|archivedate= 2009-11-18|df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

P&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;G is [[Corporate headquarters|headquartered]] in the McGill University Genome Quebec Innovation Centre, Montreal ([[Canada]]).

== Scientific Activities ==

===Online===

P&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;G works with its members and other experts to develop tools, methods and resources designed to optimize and harmonize the infrastructures of biobanks and research projects in the areas of [[population genetics|population genomics]], [[epidemiology]] and the [[Environment (biophysical)|environment]]. The P&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;G site is completely free and accessible, and all documents, web sites and tools included on the site are non-commercial and open source. Such tools include:

'''Toolkit''' - provides the epidemiological, ethical, statistical and IT instruments necessary to the access and use of data. The aim of this platform is to create a one-stop location and open access environment, where key documents are accessible to the research community. The TOOLKIT currently contains over 80 tools across five categories (Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Sample collection and processing, Data collection and processing, GE3LS, other tools).

'''Lifespan''' - an open access web platform offering users a step-by-step approach for the development and maintenance of a biobank or a research project within a definitive funding timeline.

'''HUB''' - provides an online agora for all those interested in genetic and genomic research, allowing for ongoing discussion, exchange and collaboration on research projects.

'''Training''' - provides researchers in the biobanking field with pertinent and up-to-date training opportunities

'''Catalogs''' - currently provide information on large population-based biobanks. Over 160 studies, spanning all continents, are presently listed in the database, and this index is regularly updated and curated to include relevant studies.

===Meetings===

In addition, P&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;G bring its members together at [[meetings]] in different cities around the world. These gatherings provide members with a unique opportunity to identify and address the challenges the community faces, share innovative strategies and work on new research tools.
P&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;G Meetings have been held in the following cities:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.p3g.org/secretariat/info.shtml|title=Meetings of P&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;G's members on the Website of P&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;G's secretariat}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''IPAC Services:'''

I. Data/Sample Collection - ELSI Interoperability

IPAC offers the following interoperability services:
* International comparative analysis of consents (legacy/prospective collections)
* Preparation of harmonized policies and consents for de novo projects
* Advice on changes to consents/re-contact/return of results
* Preparation of documents for IRB approvals including IP/publication policies
* Preparation of templates for MTA’s and for customized access agreements
* Validation of researcher (bona fides); institutional sign off; proposed data privacy security plans
* Ad hoc ethics consultation
* Preparation of international Codes of Conduct/Policies and Procedures
* Independent review of access requests, and,
* Ongoing monitoring and governance mechanisms

II. DACO - Review of Data and Samples Access Request/Authorization and Compliance

III. P&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;G DataTrust

Due to concerns surrounding the return of clinically significant results to research participants in the context of translational projects, P&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;G has developed the DataTrust (DT) service. This service supports the process of re-contacting participants and returning individual-level results in translational research projects, when appropriate. The DataTrust (DT) proposes to provide P&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;G as an honest and independent, third party broker to act as the key holder of personal information and associated unique ID (codes). P&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;G-DT safeguards the independence of the research project team, while enhancing ethical compliance with privacy and confidentiality standards in the research setting.

== Finance and History ==
P&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;G was incorporated in 2004 under the leadership of [[Bartha Knoppers]] and [[Thomas J. Hudson|Dr. Thomas Hudson]], and was established by and for researchers working in the area of population genetics. P&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;G is funded by [[Genome Quebec]] and [[Genome Canada]], as well as other funding agencies.&lt;ref&gt;Genome Canada, Genome Quebec and Université de Montreal Launch P3G Consortium and CARTaGENE Project http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/72178.php&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6796">{{for|formal and natural language features to indicate quantity|Quantifier (logic)|Quantifier (linguistics)}}
In [[mathematics]] and [[empirical science]], '''quantification''' (or '''quantitation''') is the act of [[counting]] and [[measuring]] that maps human sense [[observation]]s and [[experience]]s into [[quantity|quantities]]. Quantification in this sense is fundamental to the [[scientific method]].

==Natural science==
Some measure of the undisputed general importance of quantification in the [[natural science]]s can be gleaned from the following comments:

* "these are mere facts, but they are quantitative facts and the basis of science."&lt;ref&gt;[[James McKeen Cattell|Cattell, James McKeen]]; and [[Livingston Farrand|Farrand, Livingston]] (1896) "Physical and mental measurements of the students of Columbia University", ''The Psychological Review'', Vol.&amp;nbsp;3, No.&amp;nbsp;6 (1896), pp.&amp;nbsp;618-648; p.&amp;nbsp;648 quoted in ''[http://www.indiana.edu/~intell/jcattell.shtml James McKeen Cattell (1860-1944) Psychologist, Publisher, and Editor.]''&lt;/ref&gt;
* It seems to be held as universally true that "the foundation of quantification is measurement."&lt;ref&gt;[[Samuel Stanley Wilks|Wilks, Samuel Stanley]] (1961) "Some Aspects of Quantification in Science", ''Isis'', Vol.&amp;nbsp;52, No.&amp;nbsp;2 (1961), pp.&amp;nbsp;135-142; p.&amp;nbsp;135&lt;/ref&gt;
* There is little doubt that "quantification provided a basis for the objectivity of science."&lt;ref&gt;Hong, Sungook (2004) "[http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/305/5690/1569 History of Science: Building Circuits of Trust]", ''Science'', Vol.&amp;nbsp;305, No.&amp;nbsp;5690 (10 September 2004), pp.&amp;nbsp;1569-1570&lt;/ref&gt;
* In ancient times, "musicians and artists ... rejected quantification, but merchants, by definition, quantified their affairs, in order to survive, made them visible on parchment and paper."&lt;ref&gt;[[Alfred W. Crosby|Crosby, Alfred W.]] (1996) ''The Measure of Reality: Quantification and Western Society'', Cambridge University Press, 1996, p.&amp;nbsp;201&lt;/ref&gt;
* Any reasonable "comparison between Aristotle and Galileo shows clearly that there can be no unique lawfulness discovered without detailed quantification."&lt;ref&gt;Langs, Robert J. (1987) "[http://www.pep-web.org/document.php?id=cps.023.0555a Psychoanalysis as an Aristotelian Science—Pathways to Copernicus and a Modern-Day Approach]", ''Contemporary Psychoanalysis'', Vol.&amp;nbsp;23 &lt;!-- one vol. per year --&gt;(1987), pp.&amp;nbsp;555-576&lt;/ref&gt;
* Even today, "universities use imperfect instruments called '[[exams]]' to indirectly quantify something they call knowledge."&lt;ref&gt;[[Aaron Lynch (writer)|Lynch, Aaron]] (1999) "[http://cfpm.org/jom-emit/1999/vol3/lynch_a.html Misleading Mix of Religion and Science,]" ''Journal of Memetics: Evolutionary Models of Information Transmission'', Vol.&amp;nbsp;3, No.&amp;nbsp;1&lt;!-- because there are only two issues, and there is Gatherer, Derek G. (1999) "Reply to Commentaries", ''Journal of Memetics: Evolutionary Models of Information Transmission, Vol.&amp;nbsp;3 [No.&amp;nbsp;2] (1999) http://jom-emit.cfpm.org/1999/vol3/gatherer_reply.html --&gt; (1999)&lt;/ref&gt;

This meaning of quantification comes under the heading of [[Pragmatism|pragmatics]].{{clarify|date=October 2017}}

In some instances in the natural sciences a seemingly intangible concept may be quantified by creating a scale—for example, a [[pain scale]] in medical research, or a discomfort scale at the intersection of [[meteorology]] and [[human physiology]] such as the [[heat index]] measuring the combined perceived effect of heat and [[humidity]], or the [[wind chill factor]] measuring the combined perceived effects of cold and wind.

==Social sciences==
{{See also|Society for Quantitative Analysis of Behavior|Quantitative psychological research}}

In the [[social sciences]], quantification is an integral part of [[economics]] and [[psychology]]. Both disciplines gather data – economics by [[empirical observation]] and psychology by [[experimentation]] – and both use [[statistics|statistical techniques]] such as [[regression analysis]] to draw conclusions from it.

In some instances a seemingly intangible property may be quantified by asking subjects to rate something on a [[Scale (social sciences)|scale]]—for example, a [[Happiness economics#Methodology|happiness scale]] or a [[Self-Perceived Quality of Life Scale|quality of life scale]]—or by the construction of a scale by the researcher, as with the [[index of economic freedom]]. In other cases, an unobservable variable may be quantified by replacing it with a [[proxy (statistics)|proxy variable]] with which it is highly correlated—for example, per capita [[gross domestic product]] is often used as a proxy for [[standard of living]] or [[quality of life]].

Frequently in the use of regression, the presence or absence of a trait is quantified by employing a [[dummy variable (statistics)|dummy variable]], which takes on the value 1 in the presence of the trait or the value 0 in the absence of the trait.

[[Quantitative linguistics]] is an area of [[linguistics]] that relies on quantification. For example,&lt;ref&gt;Bybee, Joan; Perkins, Revere; and Pagliuca, William. (1994) ''The Evolution of Grammar'', Univ. of Chicago Press: ch. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; indices of [[grammaticalization]] of [[morpheme]]s, such as [[phonology|phonological]] shortness, dependence on surroundings, and fusion with the verb, have been developed and found to be significantly correlated across languages with stage of evolution of function of the morpheme.

==Hard versus soft science==
The ease of quantification is one of the features used to distinguish [[hard and soft science]]s from each other. Scientists often consider hard sciences to be more scientific or rigorous, but this is disputed by social scientists who maintain that appropriate rigor includes the qualitative evaluation of the broader contexts of qualitative data. In some [[social sciences]] such as [[sociology]], quantitative data are difficult to obtain, either because laboratory conditions are not present or because the issues involved are conceptual but not directly quantifiable. Thus in these cases [[qualitative methods]] are preferred. {{citation needed|date=December 2013}}

In [[logic]], a '''rational consequence relation''' is a [[non-monotonic logic|non-monotonic]] [[consequence relation]] satisfying certain properties listed below.

==Properties==
A rational consequence relation &lt;math&gt;\vdash&lt;/math&gt; satisfies:
:; REF : [[Reflexive relation|Reflexivity]] &lt;math&gt;\theta \vdash \theta&lt;/math&gt;

and the so-called '''Gabbay-Makinson''' rules:

:; LLE : Left Logical Equivalence &lt;math&gt;\frac{\theta \vdash \psi \quad \theta \equiv \phi}{\phi \vdash \psi}&lt;/math&gt;
:; RWE : Right-hand weakening &lt;math&gt;\frac{\theta \vdash \phi \quad \phi \models \psi}{\theta \vdash \psi}&lt;/math&gt;
:; CMO : Cautious [[Monotonic logic|monotonicity]] &lt;math&gt;\frac{\theta \vdash \phi \quad \theta \vdash \psi}{\theta \wedge \psi \vdash \phi}&lt;/math&gt;
:; DIS : [[Logical or]] (ie disjunction) on left hand side &lt;math&gt;\frac{\theta \vdash \psi \quad \phi \vdash \psi}{\theta \vee \phi \vdash \psi}&lt;/math&gt;
:; AND : [[Logical and]] on right hand side &lt;math&gt;\frac{\theta \vdash \phi \quad \theta \vdash \psi}{\theta \vdash \phi \wedge \psi}&lt;/math&gt;
:; RMO : Rational monotonicity &lt;math&gt;\frac{\phi \not\vdash \neg\theta \quad \phi \vdash \psi}{\phi \wedge \theta \vdash \psi}&lt;/math&gt;
{{clarify|reason=Explain, or at least wikilink, the symbols used above: equiv, models, ...|date=August 2017}}

==Uses==

The rational consequence relation is [[monotonic logic|non-monotonic]], and the relation &lt;math&gt;\theta \vdash \phi&lt;/math&gt; is intended to carry the meaning ''theta usually implies phi'' or ''phi usually follows from theta''. In this sense it is more useful for modeling some everyday situations than a [[monotone consequence relation]] because the latter relation models facts in a more strict boolean fashion - something either follows under all circumstances or it does not.

===Example===
The statement ''"If a cake contains sugar then it tastes good"'' implies under a monotone consequence relation the statement ''"If a cake contains sugar and soap then it tastes good."'' Clearly this doesn't match our own understanding of cakes. By asserting ''"If a cake contains sugar then it '''usually''' tastes good"'' a rational consequence relation allows for a more realistic model of the real world, and certainly it does not automatically follow that ''"If a cake contains sugar and soap then it usually tastes good."''

Note that if we also have the information ''"If a cake contains sugar then it usually contains butter"'' then we may legally conclude (under CMO) that ''"If a cake contains sugar and butter then it usually tastes good."''. Equally in the absence of a statement such as ''"If a cake contains sugar then usually it contains no soap''" then we may legally conclude from RMO that ''"If the cake contains sugar and soap then it usually tastes good."''

If this latter conclusion seems ridiculous to you then it is likely that you are subconsciously asserting your own preconceived knowledge about cakes when evaluating the validity of the statement. That is, from your experience you know that cakes which contain soap are likely to taste bad so you add to the system your own knowledge such as ''"Cakes which contain sugar do not usually contain soap."'', even though this knowledge is absent from it. If the conclusion seems silly to you then you might consider replacing the word ''soap'' with the word ''eggs'' to see if it changes your feelings.

===Example===

Consider the sentences:
*''Young people are usually happy''
*''Drug abusers are usually not happy''
*''Drug abusers are usually young''

We may consider it reasonable to conclude:

*''Young drug abusers are usually not happy''

This would not be a valid conclusion under a monotonic deduction system (omitting of course the word 'usually'), since the third sentence would contradict the first two. In contrast the conclusion follows immediately using the Gabbay-Makinson rules: applying the rule '''CMO''' to the last two sentences yields the result.

==Consequences==

The following consequences follow from the above rules:

:;MP : [[Modus ponens]] &lt;math&gt;\frac{\theta \vdash \phi \quad \theta \vdash \left( \phi \rightarrow \psi \right)}{\theta \vdash \psi}&lt;/math&gt;
::MP is proved via the rules AND and RWE.

:;CON : Conditionalisation &lt;math&gt;\frac{\theta \wedge \phi \vdash \psi}{\theta \vdash \left(\phi \rightarrow \psi \right)}&lt;/math&gt;

:;CC : Cautious Cut &lt;math&gt;\frac{\theta \vdash \phi \quad \theta \wedge \phi \vdash \psi}{\theta \vdash \psi}&lt;/math&gt;
::The notion of Cautious Cut simply encapsulates the operation of conditionalisation, followed by MP. It may seem redundant in this sense, but it is often used in proofs so it is useful to have a name for it to act as a shortcut.

:;SCL : Supraclassity &lt;math&gt;\frac{\theta \models \phi}{\theta \vdash \phi}&lt;/math&gt;
::SCL is proved trivially via REF and RWE.

==Rational consequence relations via atom preferences==

Let &lt;math&gt;L = \{p_1, \ldots , p_n\}&lt;/math&gt; be a finite language. An atom is a formula of the form &lt;math&gt;\bigwedge_{i=1}^n p^\epsilon_i&lt;/math&gt; (where &lt;math&gt;p^1 = p&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;p^{-1} = \neg p&lt;/math&gt;). Notice that there is a unique valuation which makes any given atom true (and conversely each valuation satisfies precisely one atom). Thus an atom can be used to represent a preference about what we believe ought to be true.

Let &lt;math&gt;At^L&lt;/math&gt; be the set of all atoms in L. For &lt;math&gt;\theta \in&lt;/math&gt; [[Sentential logic|SL]], define &lt;math&gt;S_\theta = \{\alpha \in At^L | \alpha \models^{SC} \theta \}&lt;/math&gt;.

Let &lt;math&gt;\vec{s} = s_1, \ldots , s_m&lt;/math&gt; be a sequence of subsets of &lt;math&gt;At^L&lt;/math&gt;. For &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; in SL, let the relation &lt;math&gt;\vdash_\vec{s}&lt;/math&gt; be such that &lt;math&gt;\theta \vdash_{\vec{s}} \phi&lt;/math&gt; if one of the following holds:
#&lt;math&gt;S_\theta \cap s_i = \emptyset&lt;/math&gt; for each &lt;math&gt;1 \leq i \leq m&lt;/math&gt;
#&lt;math&gt;S_\theta \cap s_i \neq \emptyset&lt;/math&gt; for some &lt;math&gt;1 \leq i \leq m&lt;/math&gt; and for the least such i, &lt;math&gt;S_\theta \cap s_i \subseteq S_\phi&lt;/math&gt;.

Then the relation  &lt;math&gt;\vdash_\vec{s}&lt;/math&gt;  is a rational consequence relation. This may easily be verified by checking directly that it satisfies the GM-conditions.

The idea behind the sequence of atom sets is that the earlier sets account for the most likely situations such as ''"young people are usually law abiding"'' whereas the later sets account for the less likely situations such as ''"young joyriders are usually not law abiding"''.

===Notes===
#By the definition of the relation &lt;math&gt;\vdash_\vec{s}&lt;/math&gt;, the relation is unchanged if we replace &lt;math&gt;s_2&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;s_2 \setminus s_1&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;s_3&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;s_3 \setminus s_2 \setminus s_1&lt;/math&gt; ... and &lt;math&gt;s_m&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;s_m \setminus \bigcup_{i=1}^{m-1} s_i&lt;/math&gt;. In this way we make each &lt;math&gt;s_i&lt;/math&gt; disjoint. Conversely it makes no difference to the rcr &lt;math&gt;\vdash_\vec{s}&lt;/math&gt; if we add to subsequent &lt;math&gt;s_i&lt;/math&gt; atoms from any of the preceding &lt;math&gt;s_i&lt;/math&gt;.

==The representation theorem==
It can be proven that any rational consequence relation on a finite language is representable via a sequence of atom preferences above. That is, for any such rational consequence relation &lt;math&gt;\vdash&lt;/math&gt; there is a sequence &lt;math&gt;\vec{s} = s_1, \ldots , s_m&lt;/math&gt; of subsets of &lt;math&gt;At^L&lt;/math&gt; such that the associated rcr &lt;math&gt;\vdash_\vec{s}&lt;/math&gt; is the same relation: &lt;math&gt;\vdash_\vec{s} = \vdash&lt;/math&gt;

===Notes===
#By the above property of &lt;math&gt;\vdash_\vec{s}&lt;/math&gt;, the representation of an rcr &lt;math&gt;\vdash&lt;/math&gt; need not be unique - if the &lt;math&gt;s_i&lt;/math&gt; are not disjoint then they can be made so without changing the rcr and conversely if they are disjoint then each subsequent set can contain any of the atoms of the previous sets without changing the rcr.

'''Robert Livingston''' was born in [[New York City]] in January 1933. He grew up in New York, California and Texas, and graduated from [[Cornell University]]. He spent two years in Japan and Korea in the U.S. Army in the early 1950s, and studied and travelled in Europe after his Army discharge. After three years as a registered representative of the New York Stock Exchange, he returned to Europe where he was head of an international financial services corporation for ten years. He then retired from the business world and began practising Zen with Master [[Taisen Deshimaru]] in Paris.

He became a close disciple of Deshimaru, who made Livingston a Zen teacher. Before his death in 1982, Deshimaru asked him to go to America and open a Zen dojo and teach true Zen practice in the United States. Livingston Roshi founded the American Zen Association and the [[New Orleans Zen Temple]]&lt;ref name="Wilson2012"&gt;{{cite book|last=Wilson|first=Jeff|title=Dixie Dharma: Inside a Buddhist Temple in the American South|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ij5rcxlZCwUC&amp;pg=PT50|accessdate=10 October 2014|year=2012|publisher=Univ of North Carolina Press|isbn=9780807869970|page=50}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1983, and has been teaching in this country ever since.

'''Samuel Alexander''', {{post-nominals|country=GBR|commas=on|OM|FBA|size=100%}} (6 January 1859{{spaced ndash}}13 September 1938) was an Australian-born British philosopher. He was the first Jewish fellow of an [[Oxbridge]] college.&lt;ref&gt;[[Dictionary of National Biography]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Alexander was born at 436 [[George Street, Sydney|George Street]], in what is now the commercial heart of Sydney, Australia. He was the third son of Samuel Alexander, a prosperous [[saddle]]r, and Eliza née Sloman. Both parents were [[Jewish]]. His father died just before he was born, and Eliza moved to the adjacent colony of [[Victoria, Australia|Victoria]] in 1863 or 1864. They went to live at [[St Kilda, Victoria|St Kilda]], and Alexander was placed at a private school kept by a Mr Atkinson.

In 1871, he was sent to [[Wesley College, Melbourne]], then under the headmastership of [[Martin Howy Irving|Professor Irving]], and was always grateful for the efficiency and comprehensiveness of his schooling. He matriculated at the [[University of Melbourne]] on 22 March 1875 to do arts. He was placed in the first class in both his first and second years, was awarded the classical and mathematical exhibitions (top of year) in his first year. In his second year, he won the exhibitions in Greek; Latin and English; mathematics and natural philosophy; and natural science.

===England===
In May 1877, Alexander left for England in an attempt to win a scholarship, arriving at the end of August. Undecided whether to go to [[University of Oxford|Oxford]] or [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]] he chose Oxford and sat for a scholarship at [[Balliol College, Oxford|Balliol College]]. Among the competition were [[George Curzon, 1st Marquess Curzon of Kedleston|George Curzon]] and [[J. W. Mackail]]. Though his tutor thought little of his chances Alexander achieved second place after Mackail and gained a scholarship.

At Oxford, he obtained a first class in classical and mathematical moderations, a rare achievement, and a first class in [[Literae Humaniores|Greats]], his final examination for the degree of BA, in 1881. Two of his tutors were the philosopher [[Thomas Hill Green|T. H. Green]] and the Latinist [[Henry Nettleship]], who exercised a great influence on his early work.

==Work and publications==
After taking his degree, Alexander was made a fellow of [[Lincoln College, Oxford|Lincoln College]], where he remained as philosophy tutor from 1882 to 1893. It was during this period that he developed his interest in [[psychology]], then a neglected subject. In 1887, he won the Green moral philosophy prize with an essay on the subject "In what direction does Moral Philosophy seem to you to admit or require advance?" This was the basis of his volume ''Moral Order and Progress'', which was published in 1889 and went into its third edition in 1899.

By 1912, however, Alexander had altered his views to some extent and considered that the book had served its purpose and had become dated. During the period of his fellowship at Lincoln, he contributed articles on philosophical subjects to ''Mind'', the ''Proceedings of the Aristotelian Society'', and the ''International Journal of Ethics''. He did some travelling on the continent, and in the winter of 1890–91 was in Germany working at the psychological laboratory of [[Hugo Münsterberg]] at [[Freiburg]]. Among his colleagues at Lincoln was [[Walter Baldwin Spencer]].

For some time, Alexander had wanted to obtain a professorship. He made three unsuccessful attempts before he was appointed at the [[Owens College, Manchester]] in 1893, remaining there for the rest of his life. There, he quickly became a leading figure in the university. Among his colleagues there was the educational theorist [[Catherine Isabella Dodd]]. Unconventional in his attire and his manner of conducting his classes, there was something in him that drew students and colleagues alike to him. He wrote little, and his growing deafness made it difficult for him to get much out of philosophical discussions, though he could manage conversation.

An important change in his home life occurred in 1902 when the whole of his family – his mother, an aunt, two elder brothers and his sister – came from Australia to live with him. It worked well in Alexander's case. His sister became a most efficient hostess and on Wednesday evenings fellow members of the staff, former pupils, a few advanced students and others would drop in. His home at that time was at 6 Mauldeth Road West in [[Withington]] (from 1904 in the [[Manchester|City of Manchester]]).

Alexander was the "unofficial godfather" of writer [[Naomi Mitchison]], born in 1897 – and as she noted, he took this far more seriously than many who have such a position officially. From an early age he took an interest in her studies and her intellectual and literary development, and often wrote her long and detailed letters offering useful advice. Mitchison devoted a chapter in her autobiographical work ''You may well ask'' to Alexander, recounting with great warmth and affection various anecdotes of her contact with him over several decades until his death and quoting extensively from letters that he wrote her.&lt;ref&gt;[[Naomi Mitchison]], 
You may well ask", London, 1979, Part II, Chapter 1.&lt;/ref&gt; The chapter in Mitchison's book devoted to Alexander is called "Beauty and the Bicycle", a reference to the bicycle which was Alexander's preferred means of locomotion - a familiar sight in the streets of Manchester at the time.

He was given the Hon. LLD of [[St Andrews]] in 1905, and in later years he received Hon. Litt. D. degrees from Durham, Liverpool, Oxford and Cambridge. In 1908, he published ''Locke'', a short but excellent study, which was included in the ''Philosophies Ancient and Modern Series''. He was president of the [[Aristotelian Society]] from 1908–1911 and from 1936–37. In 1913, was made a fellow of the [[British Academy]]. He was appointed [[Gifford Lectures|Gifford lecturer]] at Glasgow in 1915, and delivered his lectures in the winters of 1917 and 1918. These he developed into his great work ''Space, Time, and Deity'', published in two volumes in 1920, which his biographer has called the "boldest adventure in detailed speculative metaphysics attempted in so grand a manner by any English writer between 1655 and 1920".  That its conclusions should be universally accepted was scarcely to be expected, but it was widely and well reviewed, and made a great impression on philosophic thinkers at the time and for many years after. His Arthur Davis Memorial Lecture on ''Spinoza and Time'' was published in 1921, and in 1924 Alexander retired from his chair.

Though Alexander kept his Manchester professorship until retirement, "He tried, on several occasions, to return to Oxford as a professor, but (I am as good as certain) never thought of leaving 'dear sooty Manchester' for any place other than Oxford."&lt;ref&gt;'Samuel Alexander, 1859–1938', Proceedings of the British Academy, XXIV, 1938: 382&lt;/ref&gt; The Public Orator of Oxford, Arthur Blackburne,&lt;ref&gt;Oxford University Calendar, 1932:23&lt;/ref&gt; took rather a condescending view of Manchester and commended Alexander for his civilizing activities in the city: ''Et quid est gratius quam ea studia quae praecipue nostra sunt eo quoque pervenire ubi plerique se negotiis potius quam Musis deditos esse profitentur?''.&lt;ref&gt;quoted in 'Samuel Alexander, 1859–1938', Proceedings of the British Academy, XXIV, 1938:382&lt;/ref&gt; This translates as:&lt;ref&gt;Translated by Geoffrey Thomas, School of Philosophy, Birkbeck College, University of London&lt;/ref&gt; "'And what is more pleasant than that those studies, which are especially ours, should also reach that area [region, point] where the majority confess themselves to be devoted to business rather than the Arts?"

===Semi-retirement===
Before he retired, Alexander had longed for leisure, but it was impossible for him to be idle. He continued to give short courses and single lectures in connection with the extramural department, he graded examinations for higher degrees and also did some reviewing. He retained until 1930 the office of presenter for honorary degrees. His short orations when presenting were models of grace and skill. He remained on many committees, always ready to give them the benefit of his help and wisdom. Alexander kept up his interest in the British Academy and the British Institute of Philosophy, as well as in Jewish communities in England and Palestine.

===Honours===
In 1925, he was honoured by the presentation of his bust by Epstein to the [[University of Manchester]], where it was placed in the centre of the hall of the arts building, which is named after him. He was Herbert Spencer lecturer at Oxford in 1927, and in 1930, amid congratulations from all over the country, the [[Order of Merit]] was conferred on him, the first to an Australian-born.

In 1933, he published ''Beauty and other Forms of Value'', mainly an essay in aesthetics, which incorporated passages from papers that had appeared in the previous 10 years. Some of the earlier parts of the book were deliberately meant to be provocative, and Alexander had hoped that artists of distinction in various mediums might be tempted to say how they worked. He had, however, not reckoned with the difficulty most artists find in explaining their methods of work and the response was comparatively meagre.

===Death and legacy===
He was greatly troubled by [[Nazi Germany#Persecution of Jews|the sufferings of the Jews in Europe]] and gave much of his time and money in helping to alleviate them.

Early in 1938, he realised that his end was approaching and he died on 13 September 1938. He was unmarried and his ashes lie in Manchester Southern cemetery (British Jewish Reform Congregation section).

His will was proved at about £16,000, of which £1,000 went to the [[Hebrew University of Jerusalem|University of Jerusalem]] and the bulk of the remainder to the University of Manchester. In 1939, his ''Philosophical and Literary Pieces'' was published with a memoir by his literary executor, John Laird. This volume included papers on literary subjects, as well as philosophical lectures, several of which had been published separately.

When lecturing, Alexander could be quite informal, at times dropping into a kind of conversation with his class, and would follow a side track if it looked promising. He did not always give the impression that he was much interested in teaching, yet he was a great teacher whose influence was widespread. He was one of the greatest speculative thinkers of his time.

A theatre at [[Monash University]], Melbourne, is named for him and a cast of his bust by Epstein stands in its foyer.

The building formerly known as Humanities Lime Grove at the [[University of Manchester]] was renamed the Samuel Alexander Building in 2007. It was given Grade II listed building status by English Heritage on 12 February 2010. As in Melbourne, a cast of his bust by Epstein stands in its foyer.

==Philosophical ideas==
Two key concepts for Alexander are those of an "emergent quality" and the idea of [[emergent evolution]]:

{{Quotation|As existents within Space-Time, minds enter into various relations of a perfectly general character with other things and with one another. These account for the familiar features of mental life: knowing, freedom, values and the like. In the hierarchy of qualities the next higher quality to the highest attained is deity. God is the whole universe engaged in process towards the emergence of this new quality, and religion is the sentiment in us that we are drawn towards him, and caught in the movement of the world to a higher level of existence.|Space, Time and Deity [1920] Vol. II, p. 428}}

His task, as in any metaphysical theory, was to account for every aspect of existing reality in the simplest and most economical basis. Alexander's idea was to start with space and time, each of which he regarded as inconceivable without the other, in fact mutually equivalent. Out of this, pure spacetime emerges, through a process Alexander describes simply as "motion", the stuff and matter that make up our material world:

{Quotation|Space-Time, the universe in its primordial form, is the stuff out of which all existents are made. It is Space-Time with the characters which we have found it to reveal to experience. But it has no 'quality' save that of being spatio-temporal or motion. |Space, Time and Deity [1920] Vol. I, p. 342}}

{{Quotation|Motion is not a succession of point-instants, but rather a point-instant is the limiting case of a motion. |Space, Time and Deity [1920] Vol. I, p. 321}}

{{Quotation|Point-instants are real but their separateness from one another is conceptual. They are in fact the elements of motion and in their reality are inseparable from the universe of motion; they are elements in a continuum. |Space, Time and Deity [1920] Vol. I, p. 325}}

{{Quotation|For Time makes Space distinct and Space makes Time distinct... Space or Time, may be regarded as supplying the element of diversity to the element of identity supplied by the other. |Space, Time and Deity [1920] Vol. I, p. 195 }}

Alexander absolutizes spacetime, and even speaks of it as a "stuff" of which things are made. At the same time he also says that spacetime can be called "Motions" – not motion in the singular, but complexes of motions with kaleidoscopic changes within a continuum. So one might say that for Alexander motion is primitive, and space and time are defined through relations between motions.

In ''Space, Time, and Deity'' Alexander held that an object may be before a consciousness, but is not in it; consciousness of an object is not the same as consciousness of one's consciousness of the object. For example, an object such as a chair may be apprehended by a consciousness, but the chair is not located within that consciousness; and, the contemplation of the chair is distinct from thinking about the act of contemplating the chair. Further, since the contemplation of an object is itself an action, in Alexander's view it cannot be "contemplated," but only subjectively experienced, or "enjoyed."

Alexander asked the question:

{{Quotation|How far a science of order could be founded on this bare conception of ordered parts of Space-Time I do not know. But at any rate the more comprehensive theorems of [[speculative mathematics]] at the present time do not thus proceed. They appear to use the conception of Space and Time not as being stuffs, as we have taken them to be, within which there are relations of the parts of Space and Time themselves, but as relational in the sense that they are relations between things or entities. This is the antithesis between absolute and relational|Space, Time and Deity [1920] Vol. I, p. 168}}

The question went largely unanswered and his work is mostly ignored (or, at best, little known) these days. Alexander's views have also been described as [[panentheistic]].&lt;ref&gt;John W. Cooper ''Panentheism, the other God of the philosophers: from Plato to the present'' 2006, pp. 133–134&lt;/ref&gt;

Alexander was a contemporary of [[Alfred North Whitehead]], whom he influenced, and mentored others who went on to become major figures in 20th century British philosophy.

To [[R. G. Collingwood|Collingwood]] he was a "philosophical genius of very high order".&lt;ref&gt;Collingwood (1945) - The Idea of Nature - Clarendon Press, Oxford  p 158&lt;/ref&gt;

A large subset of this effect, the '''moral credential effect''', is a bias that occurs when a person's track record as a good egalitarian establishes in them an unconscious ethical certification, endorsement, or license that increases the likelihood of less egalitarian decisions later. This effect occurs even when the audience or moral peer group is unaware of the affected person's previously established moral credential. For example, individuals who had the opportunity to recruit a woman or African American person in one setting were more likely to say later, in a different setting, that a job would be better suited for a man or a Caucasian person.{{r|Monin2001}} Similar effects also appear to occur when a person observes another person from a group they identify with making an egalitarian decision.&lt;ref name="Kouchaki2011"/&gt;

Self-licensing can have negative societal consequences since it has a permissive effect on behaviors such as racial prejudice and discrimination, selfishness, poor dietary and health habits, and excessive energy consumption.
{{Unreliable sources|date=August 2018}}

==Definitions==
Researchers Uzma Khan and Ravi Dhar describe the phenomena as follows:&lt;ref name=Khan2/&gt;

{{quote|The moral licensing effect is a non conscious effect that operates by providing a moral boost in the self-concept, which increases the preference for a relative immoral action subsequently by dampening the negative self attributions associated with such behavior.

Prior choices that activate and boost the self-concept, are likely to subsequently license more self-indulgent choices...Licensing can operate through an expression of the intent to be virtuous, which reduces negative self-attributions associated with the purchase of relative luxuries.}}

Similarly, Anna Merritt and colleagues have explained that

{{quote|Past good deeds can liberate individuals to engage in behaviors that are immoral, unethical, or otherwise problematic, behaviors that they would otherwise avoid for fear of feeling or appearing immoral.&lt;ref name=Merritt/&gt;}}

==Group membership==
It has been found that moral credentials can be obtained vicariously. That is, a person will behave as if they themselves have moral credentials when that person observes another person from a group they identify with making an egalitarian decision.&lt;ref name="Kouchaki2011"/&gt; In research that draws on [[social identity theory]] it was also found that group membership moderates the effectiveness of moral credentials in mitigating perceptions of prejudice. Specifically, it was observed that displays of moral credentials have more effect between people who share [[ingroups and outgroups|in-group]] status.&lt;ref name=Krumm2008/&gt;

==Examples==
Research suggests that self-licensing affects moral self-regulation and individual behavior in a variety of contexts; for example, it can influence consumer purchases, political opinions, charitable giving, energy policy and home energy use, job hiring, racial attitudes, health-related decision-making, [[risky sexual behavior]], alcohol consumption, and [[dietary supplement]] use.&lt;ref name=Khan2&gt;{{cite journal|title=Licensing effect in consumer choice |journal=Journal of Marketing Research|year=2006|volume=43|issue=2 |pages=259–266 |url=http://faculty.som.yale.edu/ravidhar/documents/LicensingEffectinConsumerChoice.pdf|doi=10.1509/jmkr.43.2.259|last1=Khan|first1=Uzma|last2=Dhar|first2=Ravi}} [http://www.marketingpower.com/AboutAMA/Pages/AMA%20Publications/AMA%20Journals/Journal%20of%20Marketing%20Research/TOCs/SUM_2006.2/Licensing_Effect.aspx Executive summary].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Kuo&gt;{{cite news|last=Kuo|first=Iris|title='Licensing effect' seen in dieting, charity, hiring|accessdate=2012-08-09|newspaper=Knight Ridder/Tribune Information Services|date=February 1, 2006|url=http://www.mcclatchydc.com/latest-news/article24453595.html|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160529093131/http://www.mcclatchydc.com/latest-news/article24453595.html|archivedate=May 29, 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Rosenwald&gt;{{cite news|last=Rosenwald|first=Michael S|title=Why going green won't make you better or save you money|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/07/16/AR2010071606839.html|accessdate=2012-08-09|newspaper=Washington Post|date=July 18, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Chernev&gt;{{cite journal|last=Chernev|first=Alexander|title=The Dieter's Paradox|journal=Journal of Consumer Psychology|volume=21|issue=2|pages=178–183|year=2010|doi=10.1016/j.jcps.2010.08.002 |url=http://www.myscp.org/pdf/short%20articles/JCPS_10-00088_180.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Chiou&gt;{{cite journal|title=Ironic effects of dietary supplementation: illusory invulnerability created by taking dietary supplements licenses health-risk behaviors |journal=Psychological Science |year=2011 |volume=22 |issue=8 |pmid=21764996 |doi=10.1177/0956797611416253 |pages=1081–1086 |last1=Chiou |first1=W.

===Dietary supplement use and unhealthy behavior===
A 2011 study published by researchers in Taiwan indicated that people who take [[multivitamin]] pills, especially those who believe that they are receiving significant health benefits from supplement use, are more prone to subsequently engage in unhealthy activities.&lt;ref name=Chiou/&gt;&lt;ref name=Goldacre/&gt;&lt;ref name=Huget/&gt; Participants in the study were divided into two groups, both of which were given [[placebo]] pills; one group was correctly informed that the pills contained no active ingredients and the other group was told that the pills were multivitamin supplements. Survey results showed that participants who thought that they had received a multivitamin were predisposed to smoking more cigarettes and more likely to believe that they were invulnerable to harm, injury, and disease as compared with subjects who knew that they were given a placebo. Participants who believed they were given a multivitamin were also less likely to exercise and to choose healthier food, and had a higher desire to engage in "hedonic activities that involve instant gratification but pose long-term health hazards", such as casual sex, sunbathing, wild parties, and excessive drinking. In the 'multivitamin' group, the more supplements a participant used, the less likely they were to exercise, and smoking was highest among participants who expressed a conscious belief that multivitamins increased health. 
 
The study's authors argued that because dietary supplements are perceived as conferring health advantages, use of such supplements may create an illusory sense of invulnerability that disinhibits unhealthy behaviors. Overall, the study shows that people who take supplements may feel that merely taking a pill is a sufficient contribution to healthful living to enjoy other activities without regard to health, and it exposes a potential hypocrisy among supplement users.&lt;ref name=Huget/&gt; The authors advised:

{{quote|Smokers who take dietary supplements can fool themselves into thinking they are protected against cancer and other diseases. Reminding health conscious smokers that multivitamins don't prevent cancer may help them control their smoking or even encourage them to stop.&lt;ref name=Healthdaily&gt;{{cite news|title='Licensing effect' negating the benefit of vitamins|url=http://www.healthdaily.co.uk/wellbeing/2011/08/04/licensing-effect-negating-the-benefit-of-vitamins|newspaper=Health Daily|date=August 4, 2011|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131022152225/http://www.healthdaily.co.uk/wellbeing/2011/08/04/licensing-effect-negating-the-benefit-of-vitamins|archivedate=October 22, 2013|df=}} Cites {{harvtxt|Chiou|Yang|Wan|2011}}.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Commenting on the implications of the study, [[Ben Goldacre]] said:

{{quote|Believing, incorrectly, that you've done something healthy by taking a vitamin pill makes you more likely to take genuine, concrete, real-world risks with your health. It's a chilling thought, but ideas aren't without impact, and every time we humour a harmless myth – that vitamin pills are healthy, that some fashionable berry prevents cancer – we might be doing more harm than we think.&lt;ref name=Goldacre/&gt;}}

===Consumer purchasing decisions===
Researchers Khan and Dhar investigated the influence of self-licensing on consumer decisions regarding the purchase of luxury goods. They reasoned that "relative preferences for a luxury option will be higher if people's prior decisions provide a boost to their relevant self-concept". Due to the self-licensing effect, "a prior intent to be virtuous boosts respondents' self-concepts, thus reducing negative self-attributions associated with the purchase of relative luxuries". Furthermore, they predicted that consumers may be unaware of how their prior decision influences their subsequent choices; i.e. the process underlying the licensing effect may be largely nonconscious.&lt;ref name=Khan2/&gt; In the study, some participants were first asked to select from a list a charity organizations for which they would willingly volunteer three hours a week. Later, these people—and participants who hadn't been asked to volunteer—were asked whether they would buy designer jeans or an identically priced vacuum cleaner, assuming that they had enough money to buy only one. Participants who were asked to imagine having committed the charitable act before shopping were more than twice as likely to choose the jeans. The authors noted that "People don't even have to do good for this effect to happen…Even if they plan to do something good, it will give them a boost in their self-image. Any type of situation where you have guilt involved, you will see this, and so this happens in luxury goods."&lt;ref name=Kuo/&gt;&lt;ref name=Rosenwald/&gt;

A study by University of Toronto behavioral marketing professor Nina Mazar and Chen-Bo Zhong found that people who bought green products were more likely to cheat and steal than those who bought conventional products.&lt;ref name=Rosenwald/&gt;&lt;ref name="Mazar2010"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Do Green Products Make Us Better People?|journal=Psychological Science|volume=21|issue=4|pages=494–498|date=2010|doi=10.1177/0956797610363538|pmid=20424089|last1=Mazar|first1=N|last2=Zhong|first2=C. B.|url=http://www.chilleesys.com/scp/assets/mazar.pdf|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160529094546/http://www.chilleesys.com/scp/assets/mazar.pdf|archivedate=2016-05-29|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The researchers conducted an experiment in which they asked college students to shop for products online from either an [[eco-friendly]] or a conventional store. Each subject was then asked to divide a small sum of money between themselves and a stranger in a paradigm known as the [[dictator game]], in which participants can cheat to make more money. The shoppers from the green store were more dishonest than those at the conventional store, which brought them higher earnings in the game. The authors suggested that the results could be accounted for by the licensing effect, noting that "When we engage in a good deed, that gives us a kind of satisfaction. With that self-satisfied feeling can come tacit permission to behave more selfishly next time we have the opportunity". The authors added that "purchasing green products may license indulgence in self-interested and unethical behaviors", and concluded:

{{quote|We find that mere exposure to green products and the purchase of them lead to markedly different behavioral consequences. In line with the halo associated with green consumerism, people act more altruistically after mere exposure to green than conventional products; however, people act less altruistically and are more likely to cheat and steal after purchasing green products as opposed to conventional products.}}

===Energy use===
Researchers have invoked the self-licensing effect to explain why consumers who opt for energy-efficient products increase their energy usage so as to offset any potential gains. Energy economist Lucas Davis published a study showing that after getting high-efficiency washers, consumers increased clothes washing by nearly 6 percent.&lt;ref name=Davis&gt;{{cite journal|title=Durable goods and residential demand for energy and water: evidence from a field trial|journal=[[RAND]] Journal of Economics|year=2008|volume=39|issue=2|pages=530–46|doi=10.1111/j.0741-6261.2008.00026.x|jstor=25474381|last1=Davis|first1=Lucas W.|url=http://faculty.haas.berkeley.edu/ldavis/Davis%20RAND%202008.pdf|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160529122439/http://faculty.haas.berkeley.edu/ldavis/Davis%20RAND%202008.pdf|archivedate=2016-05-29|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other studies have shown that people leave energy-efficient lights on longer than conventional lights, and that many people who make their homes more energy efficient turn their heating up and ultimately see no reduction in energy costs.&lt;ref name=Rosenwald/&gt;

===Political opinions and racial bias===
{{main|Moral credential effect}}
The self-licensing effect was examined by Monin and Miller in a 2001 study which demonstrated that when participants established credentials as non-prejudiced persons, they were more willing to express politically incorrect opinions despite the fact that the audience was unaware of their credentials.&lt;ref name=monin/&gt; Subsequent research by Monin and Daniel Effron showed that an opportunity to endorse [[Barack Obama]] during the 2008 presidential election made his supporters more likely to express views that favored Whites at the expense of African-Americans.&lt;ref name=Effron&gt;{{cite journal|title=Endorsing Obama licenses favoring Whites|journal=Journal of Experimental Social Psychology|year=2009|volume=45|issue=3|pages=590–593 |url=http://faculty.haas.berkeley.edu/jesss/Effron,%20Cameron,%20&amp;%20Monin,%202009.pdf|doi=10.1016/j.jesp.2009.02.001|last1=Effron|first1=Daniel A.|last2=Cameron|first2=Jessica S.|last3=Monin|first3=Benoît|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Stanford&gt;{{cite news|title=Backing Obama gives some voters license to favor whites over blacks, study shows|url=http://news.stanford.edu/pr/2009/pr-obamarac-030409.html|accessdate=2012-08-09|newspaper=Stanford University News Service|date=March 2, 2009}} Cites {{harvtxt|Effron|Cameron|Monin|2009}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Essentially, the endorsement made people feel like they had shown that they were not biased, giving them a license to subsequently express racially prejudicial views.

'''Shigajiku''' ({{lang-ja|詩画軸}}, "poem-and-painting scrolls"), are a form of Japanese [[ink wash painting]]. These hanging scrolls depict poetic inscriptions at the top of the scroll and a painted image, usually a landscape scene, below.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Bridge of Dreams: The Mary Griggs Burke Collection of Japanese Art.|last1=Murase|first1=Miyeko|date=2000|publisher=Metropolitan Museum of Art|location=New York|pages=154}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Buddhist monks of the [[Five Mountain System|''gozan'']] 五山 or Five Mountain monasteries of the early [[Muromachi period|Muromachi Period]] (1336-1573) first introduced the poem-and-painting scrolls.&lt;ref name="Parker - Landscape book"&gt;{{cite book|title=Zen Buddhist Landscape Arts of Early Muromachi Japan (1336-1573).:|last1=Parker|first1=Joseph D|date=1999|publisher=State University of New York Press.|isbn=0791439100|location=Albany, N.Y|page=51}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Shigajiku'' is a modern category given to the visual and literary culture of the Muromachi Period rooted in the [[Zen]] tradition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Levine|first1=Gregory|date=2016|title=Critical Zen Art History|journal=Journal of Art Historiography|page=18}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The most common visual aesthetic for ''shigajiku'' is a monochrome water and ink style of painting, ''[[suibokuga]]'' 水墨画, with only occasional traces of color throughout the scroll.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cunningham|first1=Michael|date=1985|title=Painting the Wind: A Mid-Fifteenth Century "Suibokuga"|journal=The Bulletin of the Cleveland Museum of Art|volume=72|issue=7|page=367}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

The first poem-and-painting scrolls came to Japan with the return of the first Zen monks who had been studying in China. The most important cultural precedent to ''shigajiku'' was the Chinese version of the poem/scroll, the ''shijiku'' 詩軸.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Zen Buddhist Landscape Arts of Early Muromachi Japan (1336-1573)|last1=Parker|first1=Joseph|date=1999|publisher=State University of New York Press|location=Albany, N.Y|page=58}}&lt;/ref&gt; This continental version served as a model for the future poem-and-painting scrolls produced by the Japanese Five Mountains monks. Yet, ''shigajiku'' are distinct from their Chinese predecessors because of the distinctive hanging scroll format and the number of inscriptions on the scrolls themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/42855792|title=Zen Buddhist landscape arts of early Muromachi Japan (1336-1573)|last=1956-|first=Parker, Joseph D.,|date=1999|publisher=State University of New York Press|year=|isbn=0585068399|location=Albany, N.Y.|pages=79|oclc=42855792}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The creation of ''shigajiku'' is closely tied to the secular and religious lives of the Five Mountains monks. The formation of ''tatuchū'', or subtemples, provides the basis for the social relationships through which the ''shigajiku'' would be created and circulated.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/42855792|title=Zen Buddhist landscape arts of early Muromachi Japan (1336-1573)|last=1956-|first=Parker, Joseph D.,|date=1999|publisher=State University of New York Press|year=|isbn=0585068399|location=Albany, N.Y.|pages=81|oclc=42855792}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The ''tatuchū'' created a new social unit among Japanese Zen monks and gave rise to the ''shikai'' or poetry meetings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/42855792|title=Zen Buddhist landscape arts of early Muromachi Japan (1336-1573)|last=1956-|first=Parker, Joseph D.,|date=1999|publisher=State University of New York Press|year=|isbn=0585068399|location=Albany, N.Y.|pages=54|oclc=42855792}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These communities and meetings provide an important social base for the monks of the Five Mountain monasteries. Clerics intermingled with each other and exchanged scrolls with other monks during such gatherings. These monks would then compose and write poems on each other’s scroll, thus accounting for some scrolls having between four and thirty inscriptions.

The first surviving shigajiku, ''Newly Risen Moon over a Brushwood Gate'', was produced in the Five Mountains Zen monasteries during 1400. Of the eighteen inscriptions, six are connected to [[Nanzen-ji]], the temple and literary epicenter for Zen monks during the early 15th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/42855792|title=Zen Buddhist landscape arts of early Muromachi Japan (1336-1573)|last=1956-|first=Parker, Joseph D.,|date=1999|publisher=State University of New York Press|year=|isbn=0585068399|location=Albany, N.Y.|pages=91|oclc=42855792}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This connection highlights the importance of the social relationships of the clerics and the spiritual value of the painting.

==Genre Categories of Shigajiku==

The subjects of poem-and-painting scrolls vary to include subject such as: portrait scrolls, ''[[chinsō]];'' scrolls on Daoist and Buddhist subjects, ''dōshaku senki''; and landscape scrolls, ''sansui''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Zen-life: Ikkyū and Beyond|last1=Steiner|first1=Evgeny|date=2014|publisher=Newcastle upon Tyne: Cambridge Scholars Publishing|edition=1st|page=268}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Most ''shigajiku'' are the last category landscape of which there are many different representations. The different themes of the landscape genre will be focused on here as they appear most frequently in ''shigajiku''.

===Themes within the landscape genre===

* ''Zen kōan'' – riddles posed by a Zen master designed to teach/enlighten pupils 
* ''Sōbetsuzu'' – farewell pictures 
* ''Kaiyūzu'' – commemorative paintings 
* ''Shiizu'' – painting themes taken from poetry (usually Chinese poetry)
* ''Shosaizu'' – a scholar’s study in mountain setting

The most common theme of landscape is the image of a secluded scholar’s study in a mountain setting or ''shosaizu''. Monks of the ''tatuchū'' communities popularized the idea of creating idealizing, memorializing, and pining images of the scholar’s study to escape the confines of a private subtemple.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/42855792|title=Zen Buddhist landscape arts of early Muromachi Japan (1336-1573)|last=1956-|first=Parker, Joseph D.,|date=1999|publisher=State University of New York Press|year=|isbn=0585068399|location=Albany, N.Y.|pages=81|oclc=42855792}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These poem-and painting scrolls depict idealized retreats into nature with open skies, vast waters, and hazy mountain views – a perfect setting for the intellectual pleasures of retired monks living out their secluded lives. These scholar’s studies were seen as blissful escapes from busy city life where peace was difficult to find. Key features include rocks, cliffs, flowing water, a bridge, a mountain path, an elderly scholar climbing, vast expanses of water and sky with mountains soaring in the distance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Of Water and Ink: Muromachi-period Paintings from Japan, 1392- 1568. Detroit, Mich: Founders Society, Detroit Institute of Arts: Seattle, Washington; Distributed by the University of Washington Press. 59.|last1=Watanabe|first1=Akiyoshi|last2=Kanazawa|first2=Hiroshi|last3=Varley|first3=Paul|last4=Henshaw|first4=Julia P|last5=Fogliatti|first5=Cynthia Jo|date=1986|publisher=The University of Washington Press|isbn=0895581221|location=Seattle, Washington|page=59}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To say these scholar’s study poem-and-painting scrolls were only escapist would be incorrect. A scholar’s study ''shigajiku'' aids in evoking an idealized landscape to help the monk bring about a sense of peaceful serenity through which they would write, meditate, reflect, etc. Painters manipulated their surroundings and were forced to use their imagination or memory to create these landscapes that were so far removed from their own setting of a bustling Japanese city. Often looking to the deep mountains valleys one would find in China – these tiny idealists landscapes became a monks’ flight from reality via Chinese inspiration. For these Japanese monks, “incorporating Chinese poetic themes with idealized visions of Chinese landscapes expressed faithful spirituality in a way that simply painting a realistic landscape from their own mundane life could never have done… painted poetry became the image of utopia in the minds of Japanese and Korean elites, whether or not those images looked like the ‘real’ China.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Lure of Painted Poetry: Japanese and Korean Art|last=Sun|first=Seunghye|publisher=The Cleveland Museum of Art in Association with Hudson Hills Press|year=2011|isbn=1555953646|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Historically there were two ways to create the painting of the ''shigajiku'': the “old style” and the “new style.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/42855792|title=Zen Buddhist landscape arts of early Muromachi Japan (1336-1573)|last=1956-|first=Parker, Joseph D.,|date=1999|publisher=State University of New York Press|year=|isbn=0585068399|location=Albany, N.Y.|pages=87|oclc=42855792}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The “old style” is believed to have derived from the painting traditions of the [[Northern Sung]] painters, specifically [[Guo Xi]] (1020-1090), where the aesthetic concentrated around balanced and centered compositions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/42855792|title=Zen Buddhist landscape arts of early Muromachi Japan (1336-1573)|last=1956-|first=Parker, Joseph D.,|date=1999|publisher=State University of New York Press|year=|isbn=0585068399|location=Albany, N.Y.|pages=87|oclc=42855792}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The “new style” is believed to be largely derived from the [[Southern Sung]], specifically [[Xia Gui]] (1195–1224), with the central focus of the composition moved into a corner of the scroll to create a dynamic and asymmetrical image.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/42855792|title=Zen Buddhist landscape arts of early Muromachi Japan (1336-1573)|last=1956-|first=Parker, Joseph D.,|date=1999|publisher=State University of New York Press|year=|isbn=0585068399|location=Albany, N.Y.|pages=87|oclc=42855792}}&lt;/ref&gt;   It is important to note that both of these painting styles originated in China and became the way in which Japanese Zen monks desired to paint their ''shigajiku''.

''Reading in a Bamboo Grove'' encompasses the most common tropes of the ''shigajiku'', the imposing mountains, with sheer cliffs, trees precariously perched near edges, and hints of a vast open horizon. This scholar’s study ''shigajiku'' is done in the “new style,” and when compared with a composition by Xia Gui, the characteristics of the “new style” become clearer. The positioning of the mountain scene in the corner and the poetic inscriptions above and opposite the image dramatically accentuates the asymmetrical nature of the scroll.

===Inscriptions===
[[File:Early Spring Landscape.jpg|thumb|Shūtoku, ''Early Spring Landscape''. Before 1533. Inscribed by Yōkoku Kentō and Teihō Shōchū. Minneapolis Institute of Art.]]
Five Mountains monks used the ''shikai'' or poetry gatherings to discuss, create, and inscribe their poetry onto the scrolls of their fellow monks. The poetic inscription extends no further than 2/3 of the scroll leaving the bottom 1/3 for the painted image. This structuring has led some scholars to argue that the poetry is valued more than painting.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/14240696|title=Of water and ink : Muromachi-period paintings from Japan, 1392-1568|last=1935-2015.|first=Watanabe, Akiyoshi,|date=1986|publisher=Founders Society, Detroit Institute of Arts|others=Kanazawa, Hiroshi, 1935-, Varley, H.

Active in 16th century, Shūtoku created a ''shigajiku'' entitled ''Early Spring Landscape''. The format of a tall and narrow poem filling one corner and the “new” style of paining filling the opposite corner creates an asymmetry that is characteristic of ''shigajiku''. The asymmetry of the composition and the poetic inscription at the top recalls [[Tenshō Shūbun|Shūbun]], and the painting also reflects the influence of [[Sesshū Tōyō|Sesshū]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Bridge of Dreams: The Mary Griggs Burke Collection of Japanese Art|last=Murase|first=Miyeko|publisher=Metropolitan Museum of Art|year=2000|isbn=|location=New York|pages=162–163}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The text on the lower right of ''Early Spring Landscape'', authored by Yōkoku Kentō (d. 1533), translates to:  &lt;blockquote&gt;''Though the west lake swells with water as spring arrives, / the emerald bamboo outdoors blocks the sight of boats. / Had the east wind facilitated his quest, / he would have returned by boat in moonlight to the frosted land of Wu faraway.'' &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://burkecollection.org/catalogue/106-early-spring-landscape|title=Early Spring Landscape, Mary Griggs Burk Collection|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;The text on the upper left, authored by Teihō Shōchū (fl. ca. 1538), translates to: &lt;blockquote&gt;''Floating in a boathouse on the brimming spring river, / what could one desire in a sound sleep after mooring? / In nothing but insouciant boating would I spend the rest of my life, / with mountains along the white gull-dotted stream as my beauties.''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://burkecollection.org/catalogue/106-early-spring-landscape.|title=Early Spring Landscape, Mary Griggs Burk Collection|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;The poetry of these two different monks, both evoke ideas reflected in the painting below it. The natural images of flowing water, trees, and wind are incredibly calming. The musings of sleep and dreams demonstrates the monks longing to be in such a serene place. The solitude yet tranquil atmosphere of the landscape provides the perfect escape for the monks who were writing and discussing the poems in busy city of Koyto. The ''shigajiku'' medium enables the mind to reach that level of contemplation where the world disappears and all one hears is nature – a state greatly desired by these city dwelling monks.

==One Composition Interpretation==
[[File:Towering Above Wilderness Hall.jpg|left|thumb|246x246px|''Towering Above Wilderness Hall''.  Cleveland Museum of Art.]]

Poem-and-painting scrolls must be understood as a whole piece of art – the meaning of the image is informed by the inscription and vice versa. The unity of the ''shigajiku'' scroll is “painting of a poetic idea.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/42855792|title=Zen Buddhist landscape arts of early Muromachi Japan (1336-1573)|last=1956-|first=Parker, Joseph D.,|date=1999|publisher=State University of New York Press|year=|isbn=0585068399|location=Albany, N.Y.|pages=98|oclc=42855792}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Understanding the two part of the ''shigajiku'' together is vital. Scholar Shimao Arata articulates that together, the painting and inscriptions of ''shigajiku'', form the “four perfections” – poetry, painting, calligraphy, and prose. These “four perfections” express “the mind’s level of spiritual accomplishment, and this spiritual link between the four perfections is itself the subject of the earliest known poem-and-painting scrolls.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/42855792|title=Zen Buddhist landscape arts of early Muromachi Japan (1336-1573)|last=1956-|first=Parker, Joseph D.,|date=1999|publisher=State University of New York Press|year=|isbn=0585068399|location=Albany, N.Y.|pages=84|oclc=42855792}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the idea of poetry and painting influencing and changing the overall meaning of a composition preexisted the creation of ''shigajiku'' – it has become a concept fundamental to ascertain the meaning of a shigajiku. The first ''shigajiku'', ''Newly Risen Moon over a Brushwood Gate,'' follows “the classic formulation of the relation between poetry and painting developed by [[Su Shi]]h and his circle, which we have seen also was a crucial factor in the rise of the earliest Japanese poem-and-painting scrolls around.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/42855792|title=Zen Buddhist landscape arts of early Muromachi Japan (1336-1573)|last=1956-|first=Parker, Joseph D.,|date=1999|publisher=State University of New York Press|year=|isbn=0585068399|location=Albany, N.Y.|pages=91|oclc=42855792}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Poem-and-painting scrolls were intended, from the beginning of their production, to be understood as a whole piece of art with different mediums (“four perfections”) used to convey a single artwork.

''Towering above Wilderness Hall''&lt;blockquote&gt;This scroll is an early example of a ''shigajiku'' depicting the genre of a landscape and the theme of a scholar’s study. The inscription is a quotation from essays on Sima Guang (1019-1086) by the Chinese Song-dynasty literatus Su Shi (1037-1101)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/708089789|title=The lure of painted poetry : Japanese and Korean art|last=Art.|first=Cleveland Museum of|date=2011|publisher=Cleveland Museum of Art|others=Sŏn, Sŭng-hye.|isbn=9781935294047|location=[Cleveland]|oclc=708089789}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Zen monk who inscribed this scroll interpreted the scholar studio to be “surrounded with bamboo as a metaphor for the garden of Sima, the Song dynasty scholar-official who, in imitation of the Tang poet Bai Juyi, enjoyed the garden in isolation during his exile in Luoyang.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/708089789|title=The lure of painted poetry : Japanese and Korean art|last=Art.|first=Cleveland Museum of|date=2011|publisher=Cleveland Museum of Art|others=Sŏn, Sŭng-hye.|isbn=9781935294047|location=[Cleveland]|oclc=708089789}}&lt;/ref&gt; The connection between the image and the painting is clear – the painting informs the poems and the poems inform the painting.&lt;/blockquote&gt;''Hue of Water, Light on the Peaks'' &lt;blockquote&gt;The scholarly retreat depicted on the scroll shows and idyllic and peaceful setting surrounded by nature. The poem is named by the first characters of the first poem, ''suishoku rankō'', a phrase that can be literally translated as “hue of the water, light on the peaks.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.narahaku.go.jp/english/collection/1220-0.html.|title=Nara National Museum}}&lt;/ref&gt; Again this connection highlights the importance of “reading” the composition as one piece of art, instead of multiple pieces of art painting, poetry, and calligraphy. The dynamism of the ink painting can be seen through the “arrangement of various elements in this work lacks concision and a sense of three-dimensional space in its execution.” The scholar’s study in the center of the painting is offset by the commanding motif of the three pine trees and looming mountain in the background. This structural ambiguity can be seen as an attempt to render a scholars retreat that is truly separate from reality, “this painting is an excellent example of the art produced within the cultural sphere of Zen Buddhism, which shunned the worldly realm.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.narahaku.go.jp/english/collection/1220-0.html|title=Nara National Museum|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;''Splashed Ink Landscape''&lt;blockquote&gt;With the dedicatory inscription at the top of the scroll written by Sesshū himself, Sesshū’s scroll slowly reveals itself to the reader. The “unconsummated, intuited nature of the ''Splashed Ink Landscape'' has led many commentators to interpret Sesshu's painting as embodying or pictorializing the principles of Zen Buddhism.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lippit|first1=Y|date=2012|title=Of Modes and Manners in Japanese Ink Painting: Sesshū's "Splashed Ink Landscape" of 1495|journal=The Art Bulletin|volume=94|issue=1|page=50}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The unrestrained nature of this work speaks to the enlightened ideal of the Zen tradition, while maintaining the tropes of the suggested mountains, surrounding water, and trees.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''Siger of Brabant''' (''Sigerus'', ''Sighier'', ''Sigieri'' or ''Sygerius de Brabantia''; c. 1240 &amp;ndash; before 10 November 1284) was a 13th-century [[philosopher]] from the southern [[Low Countries]] who was an important proponent of [[Averroism]]. He was considered a radical by the conservative members of the [[Roman Catholic Church]], but it is suggested that he played as important a role as his contemporary [[Thomas Aquinas]] in the shaping of Western attitudes towards faith and reason.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}

== Life ==
===Early life===
Little is known about many of the details of his life. In 1266, he was attached to the Faculty of Arts in the [[University of Paris]] at the time when a riot erupted between the French and Picard "nations" of students—a series of loosely organized fraternities. The [[papal legate]] threatened Siger with execution as the ringleader of the Picard attack on the French, but no further action was taken.

=== Works ===
In the ten years following the riot, he wrote the six works which are ascribed to him and were published under his name by [[Pierre Mandonnet]] in 1899. The titles of these treatises are:

*''De anima intellectiva'' (1270)
*''Quaestiones logicales''
*''Quaestiones naturales''
*''De aeternitate mundi''
*''Quaestio utrum haec sit vera: Homo est animal nullo homine existente''
*''Impossibilia''

=== Rectorship ===
In 1271, he was once more involved in a party struggle. The minority among the "nations" chose him as rector in opposition to the elected candidate, Aubri de Rheims. For three years the strife continued, and was probably based on the opposition between the [[Averroists]], Siger and [[Pierre Dubois]], and the more orthodox schoolmen. The matter was settled by the Papal Legate, Simon de Brion, afterwards [[Pope Martin IV]]. Siger retired from Paris to [[Liège]].

=== Time in Liège ===
Siger was accused of teaching "double truth"—that is, saying one thing could be true through reason, and that the opposite could be true through faith. Because Siger was a [[Scholasticism|scholastic]], he probably did not teach double truths but tried to find reconciliations between faith and reason.

In 1277, a general [[Condemnations of 1210–1277|condemnation]] of [[Aristotelianism]] included a special clause directed against [[Boetius of Dacia]] and Siger of Brabant. Again Siger and [[Bernier de Nivelles]] were summoned to appear on a charge of [[heresy]], especially in connection with the ''Impossibilia'', where the existence of [[God]] is discussed. It appears, however, that Siger and Boetius fled to [[Italy]] and, according to [[John Peckham]], [[archbishop of Canterbury]], then perished miserably.

== Death ==
The manner of Siger's death, which occurred at [[Orvieto]], is not known. A Brabantine chronicle says that he was stabbed by a seemingly-insane secretary (''a clerico suo quasi dementi''). The secretary is said to have used a pen as the murder weapon and his critics claimed since he had done so much damage with his pen, he deserved what was coming. [[Dante]], in the ''[[The Divine Comedy|Paradiso]]'' (x.134-6), says that he found "death slow in coming," and some have concluded that this indicates death by [[suicide]]. A 13th-century [[sonnet]] by one Durante (xcii.9-14) says that he was executed at Orvieto: "a ghiado it fe' morire a gran dolore, Nella corte di Roma ad Orbivieto." The date of this may have been 1283-1284 when [[Pope Martin IV]] was in residence at Orvieto. His fellow radicals were lying low in the face of the [[University of Paris (Condemnations)|Condemnations of 1277]] and there was no investigation into his murder.

In politics he held that good laws were better than good rulers, and criticised [[papal infallibility]] in temporal affairs. The importance of Siger in philosophy lies in his acceptance of Averroism in its entirety, which drew upon him the opposition of [[Albertus Magnus]] and [[Thomas Aquinas|Aquinas]].

In December 1270, Averroism was condemned by ecclesiastical authority, and during his whole life Siger was exposed to persecution both from the Church and from purely philosophic opponents.

==Cultural references==
In [[Dante Alighieri|Dante Alighieri's]] ''[[The Divine Comedy]]'', Siger of Brabant is found in the [[Paradiso (Dante)#Fourth Sphere (The Sun: The Wise)|Fourth Sphere]] of [[Paradiso (Dante)|Paradise]] for being a positive example of [[Prudence]], [[Justice]], [[Temperance (virtue)|temperance]], and [[Cardinal virtues|Fortitude]].

The '''silent service code''' is a way for a diner to "talk" to [[Waiting staff|servers]] during a meal without saying a word, mainly to tell them that the diner is finished.  This will prevent any embarrassing situations where the server would take a meal prematurely.

To tell a server you have finished place your [[napkin]] to the left of your [[Plate (dishware)|plate]], and place all your [[food utensil|utensils]] together in a "4-o'clock" position on your plate.

Utensils crossed on a plate signify that a diner is still eating.

If you must leave during the meal, you should place the napkin on your chair to avoid any confusion.

The code is almost always taught during business dining [[etiquette]] classes.

{{ZenBuddhism}} 
The '''''Song of the Precious Mirror Samadhi''''' ({{zh|t=寶鏡三昧歌|p=Bǎojìng sānmèi gē|w=Pao-ching San-mei-ke}}; {{CJKV|j= Hōkyō Zammai|k=}}; also translated as '''''Song of the Jeweled Mirror Samadhi''''' and '''''Sacred Mirror Samadhi''''') is a [[Zen]] poem in [[Classical Chinese]] that appeared during the [[Song Dynasty]]. The work is often attributed to [[Dongshan Liangjie]] (Japanese: Tōzan Ryōkai), the co-founder of the [[Caodong]]/[[Sōtō]] branch of Zen Buddhism, although modern research suggests this is unlikely.

==Dating and attribution==
The poem is first mentioned in Juefan Huihong's biographical compilation of 1119, the ''Chanlin sengbao zhuan'' (''Chronicle of the [[Sangha (Buddhism)|Sangha]] Treasure in the Groves of Chan''), written over 200 years after Dongshan Liangjie's death. Huihong, however, does not attribute the poem to Dongshan. He writes instead that the poem was given to Dongshan by his teacher, [[Yunyan Tansheng]]. Huihong further speculates that Yunyan's teacher, [[Yaoshan Weiyan]], probably entrusted it to him in turn. Huihong relates that he came upon the poem in 1108, when it was given to a scholar Zhu Yan by a monk, whom he does not identify. The scholar Morten Schlütter notes that the poem's provenance is doubtful given the way it came to Huihong, and furthermore the style differs substantially from works of the era that Huihong attributes it to. Most later historical sources, such as the ''Zengaku daijiten'', the ''Bussho kaisetsu daijiten'', and ''Shinsan zenseki mokuroku'', attribute the poem to Dongshan Liangjie rather than Yunyan, although again, neither is likely to be the true author.&lt;ref name=sch&gt;{{citation|last=Schlütter|first=Morten|title=How Zen Became Zen: The Dispute Over Enlightenment and the Formation of Chan Buddhism in Song-Dynasty China|year=2010|publisher=University of Hawaii Press|isbn=978-0-8248-3508-8|pages=158, 230}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6841">'''Symbolic culture''' is the ability to learn and transmit behavioural traditions from one generation to the next by the invention of things that exist entirely in the symbolic realm. Symbolic culture is usually conceived as the cultural realm constructed and inhabited uniquely by Homo sapiens and is differentiated from ordinary culture, which many other animals possess. Symbolic culture is studied by archaeologists,&lt;ref&gt;Marshack, A. 1972. ''The Roots of Civilization. The cognitive beginnings of man’s first art, symbol and notation.'' London: Weidenfeld and Nicolson.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Chase. P. G., 1994. On symbols and the palaeolithic. ''Current Anthropology'' 35(5), 627-9.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Watts, I., 1999. The Origins of Symbolic Culture, in R. Dunbar, C. Knight, C. Power, (eds) ''The Evolution of Culture: An Interdisciplinary View,'' Edinburgh University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; social anthropologists&lt;ref&gt;Geertz, C. 1973. ''Interpreting Cultures.'' New York: Basic Books.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Knight, C. 2010. [http://www.chrisknight.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2007/09/The-Origins-of-Symbolic-Culture.pdf The origins of symbolic culture.] In U. Frey, C. Stormer and K. P. Willfuhr (eds), ''Homo Novus - A Human Without Illusions.'' Berlin Heidelberg: Springer-Verlag, pp. 193-211.&lt;/ref&gt; and sociologists.&lt;ref&gt;Durkheim, E., 1965  [1912]. ''The Elementary Forms of the Religious Life.'' New York (NY): Free Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Recently, however, some evidence of a [[Neanderthal]] origin of symbolic culture has emerged &lt;ref&gt;http://science.sciencemag.org/content/359/6378/912&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://advances.sciencemag.org/content/4/2/eaar5255&lt;/ref&gt;.

Examples are concepts such as good and evil, mythical inventions such as gods and underworlds, and [[social constructs]] such as promises and football games.&lt;ref&gt;Chase. P. G., 1994. On symbols and the palaeolithic. ''Current Anthropology'' 35(5), 627-9.&lt;/ref&gt; Symbolic culture is a domain of objective facts whose existence depends, paradoxically, on collective belief.  A currency system, for example, exists only for as long as people continue to have faith in it. When confidence in monetary facts collapses, the facts themselves suddenly disappear. Much the same applies to citizenship, government, marriage and many other things that people in our own culture consider to be 'real'. The concept of [[symbol]]ic culture draws from [[semiotics]], and emphasises the way in which distinctively human culture is mediated through signs and concepts. The symbolic aspect of distinctively human culture has been emphasised in [[sociology]] by [[Emile Durkheim]], [[Claude Lévi-Strauss]], [[Clifford Geertz]] and many others.

==Evolutionary emergence==
From a Darwinian standpoint, symbolic culture has proved hard to explain. One difficulty is that the concept itself often seems unsettling and philosophically unacceptable to natural scientists. Modern science became established in opposition to the idea that culturally accepted fictions can be equated with facts. Yet the concept of symbolic culture requires us to grasp just that paradoxical possibility. Long before the late twentieth century invention of the Internet, evolution allowed humans to flit between two realms, reality on the one hand, virtual reality on the other. Symbolic culture is an environment of virtual entities lacking counterparts in the real world.

It was once thought that art and symbolic culture first emerged in Europe some 40,000 years ago, during the Middle-to-Upper Palaeolithic transition – often termed the 'symbolic explosion' or 'Upper Palaeolithic revolution'. Some archaeologists still adhere to this view. Others now accept that symbolic culture probably emerged in sub-Saharan Africa at a much earlier date, during the period known as the Middle Stone Age.&lt;ref&gt;Henshilwood, C. and C. W. Marean 2003. [http://www.radicalanthropologygroup.org/old/class_text_003.pdf The origin of modern human behavior.] Current Anthropology 44(5): 627-651.&lt;/ref&gt; The evidence consists of traditions of ground ochre with strong selection for the colour red, examples of so-called ochre 'crayons' which appear to have been used for purposes of design, probably on the body, and geometric engravings on blocks of ochre. All this apparently formed part of a cosmetics industry dated to between 100,000 and 200,000 years ago.&lt;ref&gt;Knight, C., C. Power and I. Watts, 1995. [http://www.radicalanthropologygroup.org/pub_knight_power_watts_big.pdf The Human Symbolic Revolution: A Darwinian Account.] ''Cambridge Archaeological Journal'' '''5'''(1): 75-114.&lt;/ref&gt; One theory is that this constitutes evidence for a ritual tradition.&lt;ref&gt;Watts, I. 2009. Red ochre, body painting, and language: interpreting the Blombos ochre. In R. Botha and C. Knight (eds), ''The Cradle of Language.'' Oxford: Oxford University Press, pp. 62-92.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, from about 100,000 years ago, there are pierced shells which appear to show signs of wear, suggesting that they were strung together to make necklaces. If the ochre tradition has been correctly interpreted, it constitutes evidence for the world's first 'art'—an aspect of 'symbolic culture'—in the form of personal ornamentation and body-painting.&lt;ref&gt;Power, C. 2010. Cosmetics, identity and consciousness. ''Journal of Consciousness Studies'' 17, No. 7-8, pp. 73-94.&lt;/ref&gt; It was initially countered that pigment-only decorative systems are merely individualistic display, not necessarily indicative of ritual, whereas the bead traditions testify to language, institutionalised relationships and full-scale ritual and symbolic culture.&lt;ref&gt;Henshilwood, C. S. and B. Dubreuil 2009. Reading the artifacts: gleaning language skills from the Middle Stone Age in southern Africa. In R. Botha and C. Knight (eds), ''The Cradle of Language.'' Oxford: Oxford University Press, pp.  41-61.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kuhn, S. L. and Stiner, M. C. 2007. Body ornamentation as information technology: towards an understanding of the significance of beads. In P. Mellars, K. Boyle, O. Bar-Yosef and C. Stringer (eds), ''Rethinking the Human Revolution,'' Cambridge: McDonald Institute Research Monographs, pp. 45-54.&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, however, those making this criticism have conceded that the evidence for ochre pigment use, stretching back towards 300,000 years ago, must indeed be recognised as the earliest durable media testifying to a collective ritual tradition.&lt;ref&gt; Kuhn, S. L. 2014. Signaling Theory and Technologies of Communication in the Paleolithic. ''Biological Theory'' '''9''' (1): 42-50.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sa'ad al-Din Masud ibn Umar ibn Abd Allah al-Taftazani''' ({{lang-fa|سعدالدین مسعودبن عمربن عبداللّه هروی خراسانی تفتازانی}}) also known as '''Al-Taftazani''' and '''Taftazani''' (1322&lt;ref&gt;Al-Taftazani, Sad al-Din Masud ibn Umar ibn Abd Allah (1950).

D. (1999). ''Ibn ʻArabi in the Later Islamic Tradition: The Making of a Polemical Image in Medieval Islam''. New York. State University of New York Press. p. 144.&lt;/ref&gt;  He also wrote a commentary on the Qur'an in [[Persian language|Persian]] called "Kashf-al-Asrar".&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Al-Taftazani 1950 p.

New York: Columbia University Press. p. XX.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and education==

Al-Taftazani was born in 1322 in [[Taftazan]], [[Greater Khorasan|Khorasan]] in [[Iran]],&lt;ref name="Al-Taftazani 1950 p. XX"/&gt; then in the [[Sarbedaran]] state.&lt;ref name="Halil Inalcik 2000. pg 175"&gt;Halil Inalcik, "The Ottoman Empire", Published by Sterling Publishing Company, Inc., 2000. except from pg 175:"The Ottoman ulema equally respected Sa'ad al-Din al-Taftazani from Iran and Sayyid Sharif al-Jurjani from Turkestan, both of whom followed the tradition of al-Razi and whose work formed the basis of Ottoman Medrese education"&lt;/ref&gt;  He completed his education in various educational institutions in the cities of [[Herat]], Ghijduvan, Feryumed, Gulistan, [[Khwarizm]], [[Samarkand]] and [[Sarakhs]]. He mainly resided in [[Sarakhs]].   He was active during the reign of [[Timur]], who noticed him as a promising scientist and supported his scholarship, and was part of his court. [[Ibn Hajar al-Asqalani]] famously remarked about him that "science ended with him in the East" and "no one could ever replace him".&lt;ref&gt;Al-Asqalani, Ibn Hajar. ''al-Durar al-Kamina''.&lt;/ref&gt; He died in [[Samarkand]] in 1390 and was buried in [[Sarakhs]]. He sincerely practiced Islam, and practiced and preached in the [[Hanafi]] and [[Maturidi]] schools. He was of the [[Hanafi]] school in matters of [[Fiqh]] ([[Islamic jurisprudence]]) and a [[Maturidi]] with regard to issues of [[Aqidah]] ([[Islamic creed]]).&lt;ref&gt;Salamé, C. (1974). ''Introduction''. In Al-Taftazani, Sad al-Din Masud ibn Umar ibn Abd Allah, Sharh al-Aqaid en-Nasafiyyah fi Usül al-Din wa Ilm al-Kalam. Damascus: Wazarat al-Thaqafah wa al-Irshad al-Qawmi.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==

During his lifetime, he wrote treaties on grammar, rhetoric, theology, logic, law and [[Quran]] exegesis.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;  His works were used as textbooks for centuries in Ottoman madrasahs.&lt;ref name="Halil Inalcik 2000. pg 175"/&gt; and are used in [[Shia]] madrasahs to this day.&lt;ref&gt;[[Roy Mottahedeh]], ''The Mantle of the Prophet''; Momen, ''Introduction to Shi'i Islam''.&lt;/ref&gt; He completed "Sharh-i az-Zanjani" which was his first and one of his most famous works at the age of 16.&lt;ref&gt;Ibn ul Imad, Imad. (1989). ''Sezherat uz-Zeheb''. Beyrut.&lt;/ref&gt;  He also wrote a commentary of the Qur'an in [[Persian language|Persian]] and translated a volume of [[Saadi (poet)|Sa'adi]]'s poetry from Persian into Turkish.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}  But it was in Arabic that he composed the bulk of his writing.

==Contributions==

Al-Taftazani made contributions to [[theology]], [[Islamic jurisprudence]], [[linguistics]], [[rhetoric]], [[logic]] and [[literature]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;  His treatises, even the commentaries, are "standard books" for students of Islamic theology and his papers have been called a "compendium of the various views regarding the great doctrines of Islam".&lt;ref name="Al-Taftazani 1950 p. XX"/&gt;

==Legacy==

[[Ibn Khaldun]], who is considered by some to be the father of the [[social sciences]]&lt;ref&gt;Smith, J. R.; Smith, J.; Smith, L. B. (1980). ''Essentials of World History''. Barron's Educational Series, p. 20,&lt;/ref&gt; for anticipating many elements of these disciplines centuries before they were founded in the West, said of him:&lt;ref name="Ibn Khaldun 1969 p. 92"&gt;Ibn Khaldun (1969). ''The Muqaddimah, an Introduction to History'' (Rosenthal, F. Trans., Dawood, N. J. Ed.). Bollingen series, 160. Princeton, N.J.: Princeton University Press. p. 92.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
I found in [[Egypt]] numerous works on the intellectual sciences composed by the well-known person Sa'd al-Din al-Taftazani, a native of [[Herat]], one of the villages of [[Greater Khorasan|Khurasan]]. Some of them are on [[kalam]] (speculative theology) and the [[Usul al-fiqh|foundations of ''fiqh'']] and rhetoric, which show that he had a profound knowledge of these sciences. Their contents demonstrate that he was well versed in the philosophical sciences and far advanced in the rest of the sciences which deal with Reason.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Plot==
Humble and devout Muharrem lives in a solitary and meager existence of prayer and sexual abstinence. His extraordinary devotion attracts the attention of the [[Sheikh]] of an Istanbul [[Sufi order]] who offers him an administrative post as a manager for the seminary properties that support a school for orphans and poor children. Muharrem's new job throws him into the modern outside world he has not experienced before. He soon witnesses conflicting attitudes and dilemmas towards alcohol, charity and honesty. He notices that he himself has become proud, domineering and even dishonest. To make matters worse, Muharrem's inner peace is unnerved by the tormenting image of a seductive woman who tempts him in his dreams, both night and day. With the balance of his devotion now upset, his fear of God begins to eat away at his senses. He remains steadfast seeking forgiveness from Allah and guidance from his Sheikh in whom he has complete faith.

The Sheikh is portrayed as evidence of how power can corrupt. Throughout the story the Sheikh guides Muharrem on the mystical path, however, Muharrem is confused by the Sheikh's uncharitable insistence that rent is collected from everyone, even those who cannot pay. When Muharrem faces his greatest spiritual crises, the Sheikh, being on retreat, is unavailable to counsel him.

However, it is possible as seeing the actions of the Sheikh as pushing his fuqarat (student) beyond his comfortable monastic boundaries. The teacher may have given Muharrem this test to help him to grow and as a test of his character. There is a saying along the lines of 'Money will reveal a person's true character, if they are generous, they will be more so, if they are greedy, it will be apparent'. Muharrem, at first, is fair with money. He has compassion for the family that cannot pay their rent. When he is pushed by the Sheikh to collect from everyone, even those who cannot pay, a shift happens as he is faced with the crisis of following his inner voice and the directions of his beloved Sheikh.

The film ends with him experiencing an excellently portrayed crisis of spirit, driven by his inner piousness clashing against the jarring change he sees in himself, brought upon by his new job that thrust him unprepared into the modern world. He ends up catatonic in bed, being cared for by the Sheikh's daughter, yet completely oblivious to her presence.

'''''Tearoom Trade: Impersonal Sex in Public Places''''' is a 1970 book by [[Laud Humphreys]]. Humphreys' book is based on his 1968 [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] [[Thesis|dissertation]], which was entitled "Tearoom Trade: A Study of Homosexual Encounters in Public Places." The study is an analysis of male-male sexual behavior in [[washroom|public toilets]].&lt;ref name=babbie&gt;[[Earl R. Babbie]], ''The Practice of Social Research", 12th edition, Wadsworth Publishing, 2009, {{ISBN|0-495-59841-0}}, p. 75-76&lt;/ref&gt; Humphreys asserted that the men participating in such activity came from diverse social backgrounds, had differing personal motives for seeking same-sex sexual partners in such venues, and variously self-perceived as "straight," "bisexual," or "gay." His study called into question some of the [[stereotypes]] associated with the anonymous male-male sexual activity in public places, demonstrating that many of the participants lived otherwise conventional lives as family men and respected members of their communities, and that their activities posed no threat to non-participants.&lt;ref name=babbie/&gt;&lt;ref name=sieber/&gt; Because the researcher misrepresented his identity and intent and because the privacy of the subjects was infringed during the study, ''Tearoom Trade'' has caused a major debate on [[privacy for research participants]] and is now often used as an example of highly controversial social research.&lt;ref name="ttmenace"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/09/02/opinion/02macdonald.html|title=America’s Toe-Tapping Menace|last=Mac Donald|first=Laura|date=2007-09-02|work=New York Times|accessdate=2007-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=babbie/&gt;

==Study==
The book is an [[Ethnography|ethnographic]] study of anonymous male homosexual sexual encounters in [[public toilets]] (a practice that was known as "tea-rooming" in U.S. [[gay slang]]&lt;ref name=babbie/&gt; and "[[cottaging]]" in [[British English]]).

Humphreys was able to observe and describe various social cues (body language, hand language, etc.) developed and used by participants in those places.&lt;ref name="ttmenace"/&gt; The encounters usually involved three people: the two engaged in the sexual activity, and a look-out, called "watchqueen" in slang.&lt;ref name=babbie/&gt; By offering his services as the "watchqueen," Humphreys was able to observe the activities of other participants.&lt;ref name=babbie/&gt;

38% of Humphreys' subjects were neither bisexual nor homosexual; 24% were clearly bisexual; 24% were single and were covert homosexuals, and only 14% corresponded to the popular stereotype of homosexuality - clear members of the gay community interested in primarily homosexual relationships.&lt;ref name=babbie/&gt;&lt;ref name=sieber&gt;Joan Sieber, [http://www.drjkoch.org/Intro/Readings/Humphreys.htm Laud Humphreys and the Tearoom Sex Study]&lt;/ref&gt; Because Humphreys was able to confirm that 54% of his subjects were outwardly [[heterosexuality|heterosexual]] men with unsuspecting wives at home, an important thesis of ''Tearoom Trade'' is the incongruity between the private self and the social self for many of the men engaging in this form of homosexual activity.&lt;ref name="ttmenace"/&gt;&lt;ref name=sieber/&gt; Specifically, they put on a "breastplate of righteousness" ([[Social conservatism|social]] and [[conservatism|political conservatism]]) in an effort to conceal their [[Deviance (sociology)|deviation from social norms]].&lt;ref name="ttmenace"/&gt;

Humphreys also concluded that such encounters were harmless, and posed no danger of harassment to straight men.&lt;ref name="ttmenace"/&gt; His research has convinced many police departments that such encounters resulted in [[victimless crime]]; hence they were able to focus on other problems.&lt;ref name=sieber/&gt;

==Criticism==
Humphreys revealed his role to some of those he observed, but he noted that those who tended to talk with him openly were better educated; as he continued his research, he decided to conceal his identity in order to avoid [[response bias]].&lt;ref name=sieber/&gt; Humphreys' rationale was that because of public [[Social stigma|stigma]] associated with the homosexual activities in question, and his subjects' desires to keep their activities secret, many were unlikely to allow him an opportunity for observation and [[follow-up interview]] were he to reveal himself as a researcher.&lt;ref name=babbie/&gt;

Humphreys' study has been criticized on [[ethics|ethical]] grounds in that he observed acts of homosexuality by masquerading as a [[voyeurism|voyeur]],&lt;!--&lt;ref name=babbie/&gt;--&gt; did not get his subjects’ [[informed consent|consent]], used their license plate numbers to track them down, and interviewed them in disguise without revealing the true intent of his studies (he claimed to be a health service interviewer, and asked them questions about their race, marital status, occupation, and so on).&lt;ref name="ttmenace"/&gt;&lt;ref name=babbie/&gt;&lt;ref name=sieber/&gt; ''Tearoom Trade'' has been criticized for privacy violations, and deceit - both in the initial setting, and in the follow-up interviews.&lt;ref name=babbie/&gt; After the study was published, the controversy in Humphreys' own department at [[Washington University]] resulted in about half the faculty leaving the department.&lt;ref name=sieber/&gt; There was also a lively debate in the popular press; notably journalist [[Nicholas von Hoffman]], writing for ''[[The Washington Post]]'' at that time, condemned all social scientists, accusing them of indifference.&lt;ref name=sieber/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nicholas Von Hoffman, "Sociological Snoopers", The Washington Post, January 30, 1970. Reprinted in ''The Tearoom Trade'', enlarged edition, 1975, page 177, [https://books.google.com/books?id=FyUzI_iWzw8C&amp;pg=PA177&amp;lpg=PA177&amp;dq=Nicholas+Von+Hoffman,+%22Sociological+Snoopers&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=pkpFYAf9jd&amp;sig=BiygNEQOh1kMz97--eAlFvdX1Qg&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=7XS4S9LSE4bUMu_mlOIL&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CA0Q6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=Nicholas%20Von%20Hoffman%2C%20%22Sociological%20Snoopers&amp;f=false "Sociological Snoopers and Journalistic Moralizers"].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Irving Louis Horowitz, Lee Rainwater, "Sociological Snoopers and Journalistic Moralizers: An Exchange", in Norman K. Denzin (ed.), ''The values of social science'', Transaction Publishers, 1973, {{ISBN|0-87855-547-1}}, p.151-164&lt;/ref&gt;

Nonetheless, others have defended ''Tearoom Trade'', pointing out that participants were conducting their activities in a public place and that the deceit was harmless, since Humphreys designed the study with respect for their individual privacy, not identifying them in his published work.&lt;ref name=babbie/&gt;

As [[Earl R. Babbie]] notes, the "tearoom trade controversy [on whether this research was ethical or not] has never been resolved"; and it is likely to remain a subject of debates in the conceivable future.&lt;ref name=babbie/&gt;

The '''Text Creation Partnership''' ('''TCP''') is a not-for-profit organization based in the library of the [[University of Michigan]] {{as of
 |2000
 |alt=since 2000}}. Its purpose is to produce large-scale full-text electronic resources (especially in the humanities) on behalf of both member institutions (particularly academic libraries) and scholarly publishers, under an arrangement calculated to serve the needs of both, and in so doing to demonstrate the value of a business model that sees corporate and non-profit information-providers as potentially amicable collaborators rather than as antagonistic vendors and customers respectively.&lt;ref&gt;For an overview see {{cite journal

TCP has sponsored four text-creation projects to date. The first and the largest is "EEBO-TCP (Phase I)" (2001–2009), an effort to produce structurally marked-up full-text transcriptions of 25,000+ of the roughly 125,000 books to be found either in the Pollard and Redgrave and Wing [[short-title catalogue]]s of early English printed books, or among the [[Thomason Tracts]], that is, from among nearly all books, pamphlets, and broadsides published in English or in England before 1700. The books were selected and transcribed from the digital scans produced by [[ProQuest]] Information and Learning, and distributed by them as a web-based product under the name "'''Early English Books Online'''" (EEBO). The scans from which the texts were transcribed were themselves made from the microfilm copies made over the years by ProQuest and its antecedent companies, including the original University Microfilms, Inc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

The third TCP project was Evans-TCP (2003–2007, with some ongoing work through 2010), an effort to transcribe 6,000 of the 36,000 pre-1800 titles listed in Charles Evans' ''American Bibliography,'' and distributed, again as page images scanned from microfilm copies, by [[Readex]], a division of [[NewsBank, Inc.]] under the name "[[Archive of Americana]]" ("Early American Imprints, series I: Evans, 1639–1800"). Evans-TCP has produced e-texts of nearly 5,000 books.

The final TCP project was ECCO-TCP (2005–2010, with some work ongoing), an effort to transcribe 10,000 eighteenth-century books from among the 136,000 titles available in [[Thomson-Gale]]'s web-based resource, "Eighteenth-Century Collections Online" (ECCO). ECCO-TCP ran out of funding in 2010 after transcribing about 3,000 (and editing about 2,400) titles.

==Organization==

The TCP is overseen by a Board of Directors, drawn chiefly from senior library administrators at partner institutions, representatives of the corporate partners, and the [[Council on Library and Information Resources]] (CLIR). The Board is assisted in matters of selection and scholarship by an academic advisory group that includes faculty in the fields of early modern English and American studies.

The TCP has informal ties to a number of University-based scholarly text projects, especially in helping to provide them with source texts with which to work. Institutions represented include Northwestern University (IL), Oxford University (UK), Washington University (St. Louis), the University of Sydney (Australia), the University of Toronto (ON), and the University of Victoria (BC). TCP has also worked with students by sponsoring an Undergraduate Essay Contest every year, convening task forces on the uses of TCP texts in pedagogy, and appealing to scholars and students for ideas on selection and use.

Text production is managed through the University of Michigan's [[Digital Library Production Service]] (DLPS), with its extensive experience in the production of SGML/XML-encoded electronic texts. DLPS is assisted by [[Oxford University's]] Bodleian Digital Libraries Systems &amp; Services (BDLSS), including the late [[Sebastian Rahtz]].&lt;ref&gt;https://blogs.it.ox.ac.uk/martinw/2016/03/23/the-oxford-text-archive-2015/&lt;/ref&gt; Small part-time production operations have also been started within two other libraries: the Centre for Reformation and Renaissance Studies in Pratt Library (Victoria University in the University of Toronto), specializing in Latin books; and the National Library of Wales (Llyfrgell Genedlaethol Cymru) in Aberystwyth, specializing in Welsh books.

==Commonalities==

All four TCP text projects are very similar. In each case:

# The TCP produces text from commercial image files that have in turn been created from microfilm copies of early books.
# The commercial image providers receive what is in effect a full-text index to their image product for much less than it would cost to produce themselves: value added to their product.
# The partner libraries actually own, rather than simply license, the resultant texts, and are free (subject to some conditions) to mount the texts themselves in whatever system they like, or use the texts internally as a tool of scholarship and teaching.
# The texts are created according to library-determined standards, uniform across multiple data-sets and potentially cross-searchable.
# Because they are created collaboratively, the texts are relatively inexpensive (on a per-book basis) and become more so with each library that joins the partnership.
# The texts will eventually be made freely accessible to the public at large.
# The selection of texts to convert, though differing from project to project, in each case follows similar principles: variety, significance, representative quality, avoidance of duplication; specific requests from faculty or scholarly initiatives at member institutions are also generally honored.
# TCP has been hitherto primarily interested in creating texts, not in creating a "product"; though texts from all three projects are or will be mounted on servers at the University of Michigan library, the Michigan site is not the official TCP site: any partner library with adequate resources and safeguards may do the same. EEBO-TCP texts, for example, are served by Michigan, ProQuest, the Oxford University Digital Library, and the University of Chicago.

==Standards==

All four TCP text projects are produced in the same way and to the same standards, which are documented, at least in part, on the [http://www.lib.umich.edu/tcp/docs/ TCP web site].

# '''Accuracy.''' The TCP strives to produce texts that are as accurately transcribed as possible, with a specified overall accuracy rate of 99.995% or better (i.e. one error or fewer per 20,000 characters).
# '''Keying.''' Given the nature of the material, the only method found to deliver such accuracy economically has been to have the books keyed by data conversion firms under contract.
# '''Quality control.''' Accuracy of transcription and aptness of markup are assessed in all cases by a group of library-based proofers and reviewers managed by the University of Michigan DLPS.
# '''Encoding.''' All resultant text files are marked up in valid SGML or XML (SGML is archived, XML is exported) conforming to a proprietary "Document Type Description" (DTD) derived from the P3/P4 version of the [[Text Encoding Initiative]] (TEI) standard.
# '''Purposeful markup.''' Compared to the full TEI, the TCP DTD is very simple and intended to capture only the features most useful for intelligible display, intelligent navigation, and productive searching. The TCP practice is to capture, so far as feasible, the overall hierarchical structure of each book (parts, sections, chapters, etc.); the features that tend to mark the beginnings and ends of divisions (headings, explicits, salutations, valedictions, datelines, bylines, epigraphs, etc.); the most significant elements of discourse and organization (paragraphs in prose, lines and stanzas in verse, speeches, speakers, and stage directions in drama, notes, block quotes, sequential numerations of all kinds); and only the most essential aspects of physical formatting (page breaks, lists, tables, font changes).
# '''Fidelity to the original.''' In each case, the text is intended to represent the book as originally printed, so far as that is possible. Printer's errors are preserved, hand-written changes are ignored, duplicate scans are omitted, out-of-order images are keyed in the intended order, and most of the unusual characters of the original are preserved.
# '''Ease of reading and searching.''' At the same time, though the transcriptions are carried out character-by-character, TCP, on the theory that all transcription is a kind of translation from one symbolic system to another, tends to define characters in terms more of their meaning than of their form, and to map eccentric letter-forms to meaningful modern equivalents, generally in keeping with the Unicode definition of "character."
# '''Languages.''' Though most of the TCP texts are in English, many are not. Books and divisions of books not in English are tagged with an appropriate language code, but are not otherwise distinguished.
# '''Omitted material.''' The TCP produces Latin-alphabet ''text''. Non-textual material such as musical notation, mathematical formulae, and illustrations (except for any text they may contain) are omitted and their locations marked with a special tag. Extended text in non-Latin alphabets (Greek, Hebrew, Persian, etc.) is also omitted.

==Accomplishments and prospects==

As of April 2011, the TCP had created about 40,000 searchable, navigable, full-text transcriptions of early books, a database of unmatched scope, scale, and utility to students in many fields. Whether it will be able to go on to produce the remaining 38,000 texts included in its ambitious recent plans (for EEBO-TCP Phase II) will depend on the validity of its original vision, arising from the theory that libraries could and should cooperate to become producers and standard-setters rather than consumers; and that universities and commercial firms, despite their very different life-cycles, constraints, and motives, could join in durable partnerships of benefit to all parties.

As of Jan 1, 2015, the full text of the EEBO phase I has been released under a Creative Commons License, and can be freely downloaded and distributed.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/2014/12/24/eebo-tcp-phase-i-public-release-what-to-expect-on-january-1/&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014 there were 28,466 titles available via Phase II. As of July 2015, ProQuest had the exclusive right for five years to distribute the EEBO-TCP Phase II collection. After those five years the texts will be made freely available to the public.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/tcp-eebo/|title=EEBO-TCP: Early English Books Online - Text Creation Partnership|website=www.textcreationpartnership.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''''' The No-Nonsense Guide to Science ''''' is a 2006 book by the philosopher [[Jerome Ravetz]], one of the fathers of [[Post-normal science]], in which the author offers a critical account of techno-science and argues for a deeper appreciation of uncertainty and ignorance in scientific knowledge and for a need for citizens’ participation in the appraisal of science when this is used in support or relation to policy. 


==Summary==
Ravetz offers elements of history of science and of [[science and technology studies]] and puts them in the perspective of modern circumstances when science is increasingly called to provide guidance on human affairs and adjudicate policy disputes while at the same time being a major engine of change.

He revisits many of the themes of Ravetz's major works such as his ''[[Scientific Knowledge and Its Social Problems]]'' (1971) and ''[[The Merger of Knowledge with Power]]'' (1990), as well as the tropes of [[Post-normal science]]. He repeats in this work his warnings against the "self-destructive tendencies of mega science" and the neglect of ignorance: "Curing the ignorance of ignorance is not merely a concern of enlightened educators. It is vitally important for science and survival." Like most of Ravetz's production this works takes on a new relevance in the context of the present [[science's crisis]].

==Reviews==
Jonathan Latham wrote that the book "focuses on what we can learn from the ongoing revision of this history. It argues that science was never objective or disinterested but that in the past this mattered relatively little since science was relatively powerless and less wedded to establishment interests. […] Ravetz offers the democratisation of science as a necessary and realistic antidote to the hubris and arrogance of science."&lt;ref name="Review0"&gt; Jonathan Latham (The Bioscience Resource Project), Review of: The No-Nonsense Guide to Science by Jerome Ravetz, June 4, 2008, [https://www.independentsciencenews.org/reviews/guide-to-science/  The Independent Science News].&lt;/ref&gt;

{{nihongo|'''Tōten Miyazaki'''|宮崎 滔天|''Miyazaki Tōten''|lead=yes}} or '''Torazō Miyazaki''' (1 January 1871 – 6 December 1922) was a Japanese philosopher who aided and supported [[Sun Yat-sen]] during the [[Xinhai Revolution]]. While Sun was in [[Japan]], he assisted Sun in his travels as he was wanted by [[Qing dynasty]] authorities.&lt;ref name="sing1"&gt;[[Singtao]] daily. Saturday edition.

==Biography==
Tōten Miyazaki registered under the name {{nihongo||中山|[[Nakayama (surname)|Nakayama]]}} at the {{nihongo4|"Crane Hotel"|對鶴館}}. This name would later be converted to the more popular Chinese name ''Sun Zhongshan'' (孫中山).&lt;ref name="sing1" /&gt; While Miyazaki had the same ideals as Sun, they could not communicate by speaking, due to their different languages. They communicated by writing [[Classical Chinese]] back and forth on paper.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://the-sun.on.cc/cnt/lifestyle/20110618/00480_001.html |script-title=zh:九州荒尾男の事 - 太陽報 |language=zh |publisher=The-sun.on.cc |date= |accessdate=2011-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 7 September 1900, Sun's first overseas visit to Singapore was to rescue Miyazaki Toten who was arrested there. This act resulted in his own arrest and a ban from visiting the island for five years.

The Nanjing Historical Remains Museum of Chinese Modern History has bronze statues of Sun and Miyazaki placed alongside each other.

{{Sufism}}

The '''Uwaisī''' is a form of spiritual transmission in the vocabulary of [[Sufism|Islamic mysticism]] that was named after [[Uwais Qarni|Awais Malik ''(Owais al-Qarni)'']]. It refers to the transmission of spiritual knowledge between two individuals without the need for physical interaction between them.&lt;ref name=Salafussalih2009&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://salaf-us-saalih.com/2009/07/23/the-story-of-uwais-al-qarni/ |title=The story of Uwais Al-Qarni – Sahih Muslim &amp;#124; AbdurRahman.Org |website=Salaf-us-saalih.com |date=2009-07-23 |accessdate=2016-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term '''Uwaisīyaan''' refers to those Sufis who have gained the Sufi [[Silsila|spiritual chain]] from another Sufi without physically meeting them in this world. It can refer to a school of Sufism, and its singular form, '''Uwaisi''', refers to a single individual.

==Background==
{{main|Uwais al-Qarni}}
In the science of spirituality of Islam ([[Tasawwuf]]) the Uwaisi Transmission occurs when the spirits of righteous believers (''saliheen'', ''awliya'') meet in the world called ''`alam al-arwaah'' (the world of spirits) which is beyond ''`alam al-ajsam'' (the material plane). Whoever takes knowledge through spirituality from a master in ''`alam al-arwaah''  is called "Uwaisi". This means of transmission is considered as powerful and effective as the physical relation of master and disciple. 

The term "Uwaisi" is derived from the name of [[Uwais al-Qarni]], who never met the [[Islamic prophet]] [[Muhammad]] physically,&lt;ref name=Hazrat&gt;{{cite book

It is stated in ''Classical Islam and the Naqshbandi Sufi Tradition'', by Shaykh [[Hisham Kabbani]] that:
{{quote|The sign of the Favor of Allah Almighty and Exalted on his servant is to authorize one of His saints to uplift that servant to the Divine Presence. That is why many saints who came in previous times were guides for those who came after through this spiritual (Uwaisi) connection. It is known that many saints have been under the guidance and training of prophets and other saints that lifted them up.&lt;ref name=ClassicalIslam&gt;{{cite book

==Contemporary Western orders==
According to Dr. Alan Godlas of the [[University of Georgia]] Department of Religion, the "Uwaysi Order, a [[Shia Islam|Shi'i]] branch of the [[Kubrawiya]], was brought to the West by its shaykh, Shah Maghsoud Sadegh Angha."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://islam.uga.edu/sufismwest.html |title=Sufism, Sufis, and Sufi Orders: Sufism's Many Paths |website=Islam.uga.edu |date= |accessdate=2016-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are two recent and distinct contemporary branches of the Uwaisi Order in the West following lengthy legal disputes between Shah Maghsoud's offspring.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?navby=search&amp;case=/data2/circs/9th/9615002.html |title=96-15002 - US 9th Circuit - FindLaw |website=Caselaw.lp.findlaw.com |date=1999-06-17 |accessdate=2016-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One is Maktab Tarighat Oveyssi Shahmaghsoudi, headed by Nader Angha, the son of Shah Maghsoud.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.mto.org |title=MTO Shahmagsoudi School of Islamic Sufism |website=Mto.org |date= |accessdate=2016-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; The other is the Uwaiysi Tarighat, led by Shah Maghsoud's daughter, Dr. [[Nahid Angha]] and her husband Dr. [[Ali Kianfar]]. They also co-founded the [[International Association of Sufism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ias.org/about/founders/ |title=Founders Of IAS &amp;#124; International Association Of Sufism |website=Ias.org |date=2011-11-11 |accessdate=2016-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==People named Uwaisi==
'Uwaisi' is also a name for people who claim to have been initiated through the Uwaisi method, or for those who claim to be descendants of Uwais al-Qarni. Among the most famous is the Owaisi family of [[Hyderabad, India]], one of the most prominent political And Sufi Muslim families of the city, including:

==History==
In 2007, [[Nettwerk]] music executive, entrepreneur and yogi [[Terry McBride (CEO)|Terry McBride]] founded YYOGA with Lara Kozan.&lt;ref name=canadianbusiness /&gt;&lt;ref name=biv /&gt;&lt;ref name="vcnewsdaily"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vcnewsdaily.com/yyoga-stretches-out/venture-capital-funding/vwfxdydfmv|title=YYoga Stretches Out with $9.0M|date=2012-02-02|accessdate=2014-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; After McBride fell in love with the practice of yoga, the company was founded with the intention to create a community of yoga studio and lifestyle centres whose schedules fit better into peoples lifestyles. Now in its tenth year of operation, YYOGA has grown to 12 locations.

In October 2012, McBride partnered with [[Ian Gillespie (developer)|Ian Gillespie]], a Vancouver developer, to place wellness centres within residential developments.&lt;ref name="theglobeandmail"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/life/home-and-garden/real-estate/terry-mcbrides-newest-mantra-condo-yoga/article4594337/|title=Terry McBride's newest mantra: condo yoga|author=Kerry Gold|date=2012-10-06|accessdate=2014-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their collaboration allowed McBride to build studios, as opposed to leasing and renovating pre-existing buildings. The company opened its first location in [[Toronto|Toronto, Canada]] in November 2013.&lt;ref name=thestar /&gt;&lt;ref name=biv /&gt; According to ''Business Vancouver'', the studio is the largest studio in the YYOGA network and also in Toronto.&lt;ref name=biv /&gt;

As of 2018 the company operates 12 studios in Vancouver, [[Richmond, British Columbia|Richmond]], [[Burnaby]], [[North Vancouver (city)|North Vancouver]], [[Whistler, British Columbia|West Vancouver, Whistler]] and [[Toronto]] and has an active [https://yyoga.ca/ online] and social media presence at [https://www.instagram.com/yyoga/ @YYOGA].&lt;ref name=affluenceavenue /&gt;
